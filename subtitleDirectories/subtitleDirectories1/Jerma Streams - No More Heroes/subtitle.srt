1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:10,789
Good afternoon, everybody. No music, what happened? Why is it muted? I didn't do that.

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:21,859
I swear to God, I didn't do that. Already upset. Hi, how are you? Welcome back to another live stream.

3
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:29,559
Today, we are going to be playing No More Heroes. We actually are going to play it today.

4
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,600
I was going to play it yesterday, but had a little bit of a Bluetooth problem.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,939
That problem has been resolved. Troubleshooting.

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:45,479
I'm gonna explain something. Yeah, it's all set.

7
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:56,549
Go to the dentist, you idiot. Did you brush your blue teeth? Why would I have blue teeth?

8
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,280
Why would I have blue teeth? I don't understand this reference from what?

9
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:16,709
Oh, because of Bluetooth. I had a Bluetooth. Jeez. And you guys. And you guys. That was weird.

10
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:22,950
You guys minus two shit. If I said that, it'd be minus two all day. You would clip that and say

11
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,670
worst joke of the decade. Come on now. Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.

12
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:42,150
What are we doing? Oh yeah, right. We're gonna play No More Heroes. This is an original Wii game.

13
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,439
Actually, you could argue this is one of the best games that came out for the Wii.

14
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:56,409
We're getting a No More Heroes 3. Took a long time to get it, but we're playing one of the

15
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:05,049
best games on the Wii. This game has lightsabers. So you could argue that this is a better Star Wars

16
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:16,060
than the sequel saga. You could if you wanted to. Sure you will in this chat. True.

17
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:25,689
True. Why did I just say that? Now I'm gonna like ignite the fan base. I should have done that. Oh

18
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:34,810
well. But we just started too. Jerma sucks just gave 20 community subs. What fan base? Omega LOL.

19
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,610
Okay. You don't make an entire theme park around Star Wars unless at least 100 people are gonna go.

20
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,169
Jerma sucks really just gave 20 subs though. Thank you Jerma sucks. We'll see if I suck

21
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:58,810
because this game's hard. It requires skill, requires timing, and patience. It's a third person

22
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:07,699
slashing, dodging, blocking game. 70 yeah channel points have been changed a little bit.

23
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:16,620
It is now prices have changed and if you accumulate 75,000 points I'll wink on camera.

24
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:31,960
After the 20 community subs, $100 by Phylactery. 10,000 bits. Thousands of dollars that Phylactery

25
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,780
has given over the last few months continues to grow. They say missed the last few live streams

26
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,020
so had to watch the VODs. Here's some money for sucking on that used Wiimote and putting on

27
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:54,969
lipstick. Jesus. Thanks a lot for the huge fucking money drop man. 10,000 bits from Phylactery lich.

28
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,099
I didn't even tweet that I was live. It's because my phone was dead. Give me like two minutes. We'll

29
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,780
get going. Get comfortable. Get comfortable. My words hard today. They were hard last night too.

30
00:04:07,780 --> 00:05:02,470
What's wrong with me? Be right back. All right. We've been tweeted. It's time to move over to know

31
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:18,600
more heroes. No more heroes for the Nintendo Wii. I got my Wiimote. I got my nunchuck.

32
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,779
Do you have to use both? This is where we pick the difficulty. There's only two difficulties

33
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:31,129
right now because you have to beat the game I believe first. How did I get the remote to

34
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:40,949
connect? A lot of bullshit. I mean sure why don't we go off on this? No I'm just saying I don't want

35
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:53,259
to go off every stream. I don't need to go off. I feel like every time I go off I'm just leaving

36
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:59,990
you guys a really long annoying string of 10 voicemails on your machine in a row. We don't

37
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,560
got to do that today. Let's just put it this way. Let's put it this way. It didn't work. I have

38
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,720
internal Bluetooth. Bluetooth sucks by the way. The technology never took off.

39
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,029
But it took off for like three years. No, I'm not going off. No I'm not. I'm just telling you. I'm

40
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:24,230
just going to give you some facts about what happened with this story. I'm just going to get

41
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,980
the bullet points. Everybody's motherboard has a Wi-Fi card built into it. Most of it.

42
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:37,300
You know internal. I have an internal Bluetooth. It's not good enough. It picked up five, six

43
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,329
probably houses down the street. Somebody's like fire stick. Okay. But it won't get my

44
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:48,889
Wiimote and it won't get anything in my room. So I had to go get a couple of different dongles

45
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:55,420
to test it out and try to get it to work. And I finally got one dongle in particular

46
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:04,470
that worked to connect my Wiimote. But there you go. It didn't even go off. We're not going

47
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:09,670
to do sweet. We're going to do mild. This game's hard. Many strong men await you. Yeah, it's going

48
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:22,360
to be hard. You're not going to shout them out. You want me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter?

49
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:36,470
Okay. So you would like for me to shout out a Bluetooth adapter. Special thank you to

50
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:49,430
I don't even know what the name of this thing is. What is it? No, that's the wrong one. I don't want

51
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:59,399
to shout out the... Is it dinner time? What was that? I want to say this right because if I say

52
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:10,550
it wrong, I'm going to be like a dick. A Targus? Is that correct? It's guys. It came in a package.

53
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:32,440
Hold on. I have to go under my desk. There it is. Yeah, it's a Targus. Yep.

54
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,620
So you can thank Targus Gaming for letting this happen. I know a lot of gamers out there don't

55
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,500
have much patience. Special thanks to Targus Gaming. Oh wait, you're not supposed to see this yet.

56
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,110
Okay, we're gonna see. Yeah, Travis Touch. By the way, I want to make this prediction now

57
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,389
because that's what I do. That's what we do in this channel. Travis Touchdown is going to be DLC

58
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,120
pack number two. Fighter's Pass two, character number three. There you go. Just that's going.

59
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,919
That's what's happening. All right, let's do it. Mild. Mild. Here we go. No more heroes.

60
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,019
You do ride a motorcycle in this game and notoriously all the motorcycle

61
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,059
driver but whether that's a full letter grade because you do get to drive it.

62
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,470
Unfortunately, the motorcycle it slows down the entire game

63
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,679
and no more heroes on the original Wii in the motorcycle segments ran at probably 15 frames

64
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,679
a second. I know a lot of gamers out there don't have much patience. At least that's what Bishop

65
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:57,779
the dude at the video store said. So I'm at the register and then I realized I got no money.

66
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:04,340
I was seriously broke. Why? Because I met this smoking hot chick last night at the death match

67
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:12,899
bar. Man, she smelled good. So being the gentleman I am, I bought her a drink. Anywho, I decided to

68
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,460
get a job. The gig? Assassinate the drifter. I love this game. So I went where I was supposed to

69
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,379
and waited for the guy to show up. And there he was. This cat. Well dressed, cool. Couldn't

70
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:31,700
tell if he was the shit or just plain old shit. Yeah, so he's stylish, fast, aggressive and packing

71
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:40,100
heat. Bada bing. Or at least it was supposed to be till she showed up. Her name? Sylvia Crystal,

72
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,059
an agent with this watchma call it association. The assassin skill. Congratulations. You are

73
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:51,960
certified as the 11th best hitman. How about that? I'm so pumped up for the new one above you

74
00:10:51,960 --> 00:11:03,320
and aim for the top. How's that short and simple enough for you? It's gonna be a long hard road.

75
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:13,340
But who knows? Could kick ass. Could be dangerous. Could tell you suck. What do you say bro?

76
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,100
Yes, that is. Let's see how far we can get to medic. That is.

77
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,830
That's the medic. And he does a handful of voices in this, by the way.

78
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,830
And you're finally going to get to hear you're going to get to hear it. I can't wait to get here.

79
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:45,610
How many times have you guys heard me say on this stream? Are you prepared to have at least 100?

80
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:58,179
Fuckhead. Yes, I'm so ready for this. Help me out here. Where's this death metal dude?

81
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:10,649
Bad answer. It's from Star Wars. Star Wars movies. And you upgrade. You can get like different

82
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,450
lightsabers. You can get like this like 10 different lights. There's like 20 lightsabers

83
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:24,070
across the whole. I can't wait. Let's do it. Uh, I actually do not need to do the tutorial.

84
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:39,559
I don't. I know what the fuck I'm doing. Oh, it feels so good to play. It feels so good to play.

85
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,379
Now those of you that want to know, there is two stances in this game.

86
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,149
I might have to turn it down a little bit. A little bit on the loud side for you.

87
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,990
So you see the Wii mode. I'm tilting it right now. You have high, obviously. You blow.

88
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:04,789
And you have to choose between the two. And if you're facing the same- I'm so excited. I'm

89
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:09,779
so happy right now. All right, let's go. Let's go. I can't wait any longer. I gotta go.

90
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:32,419
Let's do it. The one- the best part about this is everybody has that same voice when you kill

91
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:47,620
somebody. There you go. That is also Robert Atkin Downes doing that voice.

92
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:59,620
Oh, this looks like a prototype from Metal Gear Rising. This is a better Star Wars game than Metal

93
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:08,389
Gear Rising. I'm sorry. It is. I know I'm going to probably offend people. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

94
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:19,750
I was looking to chat. I was looking to chat. I know. Plus house. I hate everything about this.

95
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,149
Everything. This would be the worst stream of the decade if I could make it.

96
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:34,460
Get that person out of here. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. That's- that's unbelievable

97
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:42,659
for me to hear that. I have to be careful though because I will use the Wiimote and because I'm

98
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:49,639
sitting close to the mic. I will smash this into the mic. I can't be hearing this right now. I

99
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:58,389
can't be hearing this. This is a classic video game. Like one of the best fo- I would say this

100
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:05,370
is- No More Heroes. No More Heroes 2 is some of the- one of the best of the last generation.

101
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:13,980
You know what I mean? I think it is. Got a trading card. Don't anger Jeremy. He's in a good mood

102
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:26,200
today. Be careful. I'm going to get a double. Oh, you guys think that this- oh, you do- wait,

103
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,159
hold on. You don't like this game? Did somebody say they didn't like this game?

104
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:46,200
We'll- we'll see in about five seconds. Wait, I don't want to die. Here we go. Oh. Get him.

105
00:15:54,059 --> 00:16:00,840
I'll show you. I'll show you why. I'm just having fun slicing people up. Here we go.

106
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:16,970
Oh, I got a power up. I can't even tell what's happening. All right. You sure you don't like

107
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:27,659
this game? Your grapple moves are all wrestling moves. He just did it. He said it. He said it.

108
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:45,740
Are you prepared to help? Wanting one more? That's that block. Trading card number two.

109
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:53,960
I think there's a hundred? Two hundred? This is what it's like when a kid is showing their parents

110
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:07,619
their Minecraft house. Look. Look at- look at my house. Oh, wait. You watch. You can do this.

111
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,599
That's how you charge the battery. It's- it's got like that solar LED technology.

112
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:24,279
It's not a Minecraft house. I know for a fact that I- half you guys have never even seen this

113
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,559
game before. So I- yeah. Maybe it is my Minecraft house. I'm happy to show it.

114
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:52,549
All right. What- this- this is a Minecraft house. Where are they? This guy- look at- he's got

115
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,589
lightsaber fist weapons. They didn't put that in any of these Star Wars.

116
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,839
Ow.

117
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,619
That's legit. Yeah. Are you excited for No More Heroes 3? Oh, you better believe it.

118
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:27,240
That's why I'm playing this one. We haven't even gotten to the open world yet.

119
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:34,069
There's mini games. You have to work. I remember hating that part of the game. Do- okay. Do you

120
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:38,069
think I'm going to hate that part of the game again? It's been like 12 years. Do you think

121
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:48,859
I'm still going to get really mad at like collecting coconuts? Wait. Check that one.

122
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:57,960
They're mildly fun. You're going to like it more than the main game. I mean, it's possible,

123
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:09,619
but I don't think so. Oh, I gotta go back down. The only bullshit one is the one with the scorpion.

124
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:23,690
I don't remember it. The scorpions? You have to like step on a scorpion? Turn on the camera

125
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,779
when you charge the saber. Well, do you have 75,000 channel points yet? That's how you get

126
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:38,970
the camera to turn on. I don't see anybody with 75,000 yet. All right, let's do it.

127
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Pain. You're a joke. What a pain. You're a joke.

128
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Fuck that. Battery. All right. Who? Oh, there you go. Oh, this guy's also a Jedi. He's got a

129
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:37,509
lightsaber. Yep. See you later. 4,500 bucks. I love the aesthetic of the whole game too.

130
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,309
I love the little blocky quest markers. All right, I gotta actually pay attention there

131
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:50,150
because this is going to be hard. First checkpoint. Oh, he didn't say it. Fuck. I cut it off.

132
00:20:50,869 --> 00:21:06,470
What's this? Oh shit. This is one of the superpowers. Get it. Am I even hurting anybody?

133
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:28,279
Right down the road. Fuck. Oh, here we go. There we do it. Let's do it again. They're blocking now.

134
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:41,859
Smart. Thank you for playing this. I've been waiting. I've been waiting for a true announcement

135
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:48,579
for No More Heroes 3 to get in here. What's this one? Oh, this is the crazy one. This is

136
00:21:48,579 --> 00:22:00,440
like the Super Saiyan one. Give me more people to hit. Come on. I think that's it. Yeah. I was

137
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,230
very disappointed at the one that was announced with a switch. It was that weird top down one.

138
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:17,380
I'm not going to say it's a bad game because I didn't even played it, but it might be worth

139
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:27,220
playing. I heard it's bad. I heard I didn't hear it was bad. I just heard it was not great.

140
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:37,930
I heard it was very passable. Very passable in huge underline under the word very.

141
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:47,690
Not perfect equals bad. No, no. I just didn't hear it. I didn't hear fantastic things about

142
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,569
it, which doesn't matter. I'll probably play it. I'm going to do two. This is the start. No

143
00:22:52,569 --> 00:23:00,230
More Heroes 1 and No More Heroes 2 at least will be on this channel very soon. I love these fucking

144
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:15,000
games. Oh yeah. Right. I can, I can actually do a dodge roll. Oh, he's got a gun. I can block

145
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:30,380
the bullets though, right? Yeah. Another one. That slot machine comes in handy so many times.

146
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:41,190
Playing No More Heroes 2 so we can see you fail the cooking mini-game. You better believe it. I

147
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:52,119
think you want a lot of combos too in this game. If I remember. Oh, I just fucking, that guy just

148
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,640
shit. Yeah. Okay. You, you can. That's right. That's right. That's right. All right.

149
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:18,390
Anymore? When are you going to play No More Heroes 1? Uh, now? Today? You're going to fight the secret

150
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:33,900
boss? Um, I don't even really remember what that is. Does it work? Can I like answer the phone?

151
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:49,940
Will it come through the Wii mode? It's not coming through the Wii mode. Shit. I have to turn on

152
00:24:49,940 --> 00:25:10,119
subtitles. Oh no. Uh, okay. Sounds good. Pretty cool. Is it in the options? I don't, actually,

153
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:19,539
I don't think I can do that right now. This is a prank call. Go into the Wii menu. Broken Wii mode.

154
00:25:19,539 --> 00:25:24,500
Wait. No, no. I, I, I, this is being emulated. Press home. No, no, no. It's not. This is not real.

155
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:50,299
This is emulation. All right. Let me turn on the subtitles. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys,

156
00:25:50,779 --> 00:26:21,930
guys, guys, relax, guys, guys, relax, guys, relax. It's not a burnt coffee. That wasn't a piece of

157
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:28,900
paper. But hold on. Now that I got this here, let me see if I can just get it. I'm curious.

158
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:46,170
I don't know if I want to fuck with it. Let me see. No, I don't want to fuck with it. I got it

159
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:52,900
working. I don't want to fuck with it. You have to wink. Well, we'll just turn on the, here we go.

160
00:26:52,900 --> 00:27:03,619
Here. See? There. Problem solved. Speaker is on. It, it don't matter. Look, there's subtitles now.

161
00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:09,240
I, I, I will read the subtitles. There's no, nobody has 75,000 points. Turn the speaker off.

162
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:38,250
Oh, what am I doing? I can just turn it off. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look what

163
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:51,930
I got for Christmas. All right, let's go. Awful hair. I'm getting a haircut like tomorrow anyways.

164
00:27:51,930 --> 00:28:05,059
Don't relax. There's the save point. You guys have seen me with my Wii U. I, I, what are you talking

165
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:21,130
about? We already went over this yesterday. I've, I've shared photos of me with my Wii U. I wasn't

166
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:28,869
here yesterday. Fuck. I'm sorry. All right, let's get some help. Uh, what does this thing do? Oh,

167
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:35,079
it's a new move. Right. That's the, you unlock moves. I forgot. Travis, do you remember those

168
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:42,920
golden days in Calgary? The path of pro wrestling that you have long forgotten. If even a fragment

169
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,640
of the spirit of a wrestler remains in your blood, remember the first suplex that your master taught

170
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:57,529
you. Yes, that's right. The darkness piercing. Front neck chancery drop. You remembered an old

171
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:17,619
wrestling move. Look, it's easy to miss. Trading card number five. Save game. Travis the suplex.

172
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:26,539
Yeah, don't worry. There's no, you don't see anything. Those of you that want to tell me TOS,

173
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:40,440
Death Stranding did this and everything's fine. Look, there's literally like

174
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:58,680
six minute long shower scenes with Sam Porter Bridges. I think I'll be all right. Did you say

175
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:10,740
poop? Uh, you did. All right, we're good. Are you guys ready? Are you ready? Are you ready to see

176
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:26,329
like the real game? Let's go. Remember, this is on hard. No, it's not. I know. I'm just saying

177
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:37,799
that's what people think. I'm cool. Beautiful, you say? Paid for with the lives of many.

178
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:47,500
When you have the strength to take life for yourself. Pretty good red blend. I am free of

179
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:54,299
desire. So long as I had the scenery to look upon. Imagine having a pool 10 feet away from a beach.

180
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:04,259
You're the one leaving in a body bag. I'll only say this once more. Leave here now.

181
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:15,430
Melee. You obviously don't know me. You don't get it. Do you? Hey, you know what paradise is,

182
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:22,869
right? Paradise. This is paradise. The place where dreams are fulfilled. You don't know me.

183
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:31,269
Well, you've had your dream old man. Time to wake up. This is no paradise. All right, then what is it?

184
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:38,710
It's a place to die. Whoa, covered in tattoos. I'm glad you and I are on the same page here.

185
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,559
What kind of lightsaber do you have? That's this game. That was all it was cool. You have no idea,

186
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:55,799
do you? What a pity. You make an old, arrogant, crude little shits like you come around from time

187
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:09,210
to time. Listen well, young one. The wall is high, higher than you will ever know. Ultimate sacrifice

188
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:20,380
now draw. Yeah, you can take that to your grave. No, I got, I got, I got Luke's

189
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,420
lightsaber. You can't fight me with that shit. Here we go.

190
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:37,769
This count. I feel as if I'm looking at my future self. Make a box, big ass box.

191
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:49,690
Trusting nutrition is counting every calorie. A team of hot yoga instructors, nurses,

192
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:52,250
and

193
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,950
that shit out of here.

194
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:19,049
That'll be my life. I thirst for selflessness.

195
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:27,450
I'm killed by young rookies like me. This is how it goes down. And for the old

196
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,690
I realize there's really nothing here.

197
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,450
Yes, there's this sense of doing running down.

198
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:06,980
He's still fucking talking. I need to get rid of it before I bail. Instinct. Ow.

199
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,769
Fuck, he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill me. He's got me to combo. All right, slow down.

200
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:24,699
My battery, my battery, my battery's dead. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

201
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:40,309
Back it up, back it up, back it up.

202
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:56,619
I got it. It's all up high for that one. Get it again, super flex.

203
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:15,079
Oh god, which one's the real one? One in the middle? It's one in the middle.

204
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:34,139
Pass it. That's the right one. No, it's this one here. God damn it.

205
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:48,280
He doesn't know. Well, I actually don't know. I don't remember.

206
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,199
If I take like two or three more hits, I'm gonna die.

207
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:32,840
First boss. Why am I reading chat right now? Leave me alone. All right, I need battery.

208
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,099
Wait till he swings.

209
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,460
I need help. Well, I gotta get help. I think there's one in here.

210
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,389
Wasn't very much, but it's enough.

211
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:28,599
Yeah. Fuck, I just dodged. Easy. Just don't die. I'll be fine.

212
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:54,179
How many hits is that? Dodge around it. I didn't even need to do that. What the fuck am I doing?

213
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:11,380
Cut. See you later. Completed the tutorial. Great job. That's the easiest thing in the whole game.

214
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:29,750
The moment I've been waiting for, the name Holy Sword is now yours. You're joking, right?

215
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:35,750
I don't care about titles or power. I just want to be number one. Then master the ways of the

216
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:51,980
assassin. Was this before Bayonetta? I think this is the first like real violent game that came out

217
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:06,010
on the Wii, right? There it is. Rank B. That's all right. I'll take BBB. Total money. Cool.

218
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:27,210
Open the chest, please. Wii Sports was really violent. Um, no, that's maximum vitality

219
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,099
increase. Nice. No, you're right. Wii Sports was very violent. You know how many people

220
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,019
accidentally hit their friends in the face with the Wii mode? That's the first time motion controls

221
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:41,429
took off at all. You know how many TVs were fucking shattered? You know how many accidental elbows

222
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:47,349
and like to your little brother's face they were? This is probably the most violent console to ever

223
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:57,079
exist or ever will exist. How many ER trips from 2006 to like 2010 existed because of the Wii?

224
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:15,159
That data is somewhere. Is that all the uh, yeah. Nice kill, Travis. I didn't think you had it in you.

225
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:26,340
It was rather exciting. Congratulations. There she is. You are now ranked 10th. 10th, huh? What? Do I

226
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:34,739
get anything? How about some cash? That should help you pay the bills. I'm not feeling the sense of

227
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:39,860
accomplishment that I should have. So I just got to do this a few more times, right?

228
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,900
If you so choose, yes. Ten more times, Travis. And you will keep your promise?

229
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:53,300
There is nothing the association cannot do. And if I refuse? As the 10th ranked assassin,

230
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:01,059
you are now a target for those who want to replace you anytime, anywhere. Number 11 could be right

231
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:08,260
around the corner, ready to put a knife in your eye. So what you're telling me is that I got to

232
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:15,539
continue fighting. There's no way out of this. You set me up, bitch. Quit your bitching and get with

233
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:23,460
the program. There's only one road out of here. No turning back. Okay, how about this? If I become

234
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:36,250
number one, will you do it with me? Maybe. Maybe not. Come on, just once. I did it.

235
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:53,289
Ranking list, marvelous. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, death metal.

236
00:41:53,849 --> 00:42:09,989
Travis touchdown takes over death metal. It was just Galaga this whole time.

237
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,960
I believe this is where the world opens up. And yes, it is an open world game.

238
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:39,590
Rank 10. Explore the house. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here. It's time for chores.

239
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:58,219
Time for chores. The open part, open world part, sucks. Yes, it does. Anytime. Gotcha. He swallowed

240
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:15,539
the gargle. Didn't wipe. It didn't and swallowed the gargle. All right, let's do, let's go to the

241
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:24,739
closet. What do I got? You can change clothes in there too. All right, go sunglasses. I only have

242
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:34,940
the defaults. I think you can buy better ones. T-shirts. Just go shirtless. I don't, I don't want

243
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:52,599
Kingdom Hearts box art, whatever this is. Default, default. That looks good. Let's go to the drawer.

244
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,510
What's in here? I think you can look at your cards. Yeah, this is the beam katanas. This is

245
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:09,289
where you keep your lightsabers. You have blood berry. Wanted at a net auction. A beam katana

246
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:21,559
wanted an auction. Okay. What about map? Let's see. Santa destroy guide. Yeah, you can take a look at

247
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:31,480
stuff here. Is the burger suplex. Burger suplex. A burger joint with a distinctive sign. There's

248
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:38,440
the house. Here's a suplex pizza. Atomic drop ward. Santa destroy high school. Bodyslam beach.

249
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:51,260
Yeah, it's open world. You don't skip. I've skipped what? All right, let's go play. Let's play with a

250
00:44:51,260 --> 00:45:09,300
cat. Here we go. Yeah, you can play with the cat in this game. Get it. I'm gonna get that thing.

251
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:24,250
I'm gonna get it. All right, we got cards. What are the cards we got? Let's try a card. Mask of

252
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:32,250
the Legendary Wrestler El Extremo. Yeah, they're just wrestlers. I did get all the cards in that

253
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:38,659
level. That's cool. Look at this room. All right, what about the fridge? What's in the fridge?

254
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:53,000
It's a mini fridge. Was it beer and pizza? All right, what about TV? No More Heroes. The first

255
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,960
trailer of No More Heroes. Should we watch it? I think we already saw this. Did we see this?

256
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:21,449
He's got a bad nerd neck. This is the trailer for the, this is the Helter Skelter. Yeah,

257
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,289
Skelter Helter or whatever his name is. Yeah, you don't see this fight.

258
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:54,360
Helter Skelter. It is Helter Skelter. Is this spoilers? Is it? No, this is the trailer for,

259
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:05,769
this is like the official licensed Nintendo trailer for the game. Actual spoilers.

260
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:15,019
Hear the lullaby? Rest in peace, baby. Are there spoilers? All right, no, we won't,

261
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:23,210
we won't watch it then. Not spoilers. It's all right. You already saw it. It's not. Why?

262
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:34,409
I don't know. Fucking one guy. All right, let's go. Let's play the worst part of the entire video

263
00:47:34,409 --> 00:47:43,110
game. But it being pulled through PC might actually be better because this is the segment that is the

264
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:51,159
reason why I didn't play it on the Wii. This right here is the reason why. What you're about to see.

265
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:19,800
It ain't bad right now. It ain't bad. All right, back up. You watched a shitty Coke ad for this.

266
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,530
For what? Well, I guess that just answered you. Yeah, like for what?

267
00:48:24,489 --> 00:48:30,090
The next fight has been arranged. You don't have a lot of time. So I'll just tell you what you need

268
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:39,289
to know. The ninth ranked assassin is currently Dr. Peace. A doctor? Actually, a detective. A

269
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:45,050
dirty and unscrupulous detective with plenty of dark secrets about him. Illegal investigations,

270
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:50,730
illicit sales, black marketing. He is your one stop shop for marketing illegal goods.

271
00:48:51,369 --> 00:48:56,090
And on top of that, he is a trained assassin. He's been doing some work for the mafia.

272
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:01,610
And before you know it, he's up there ranked ninth on the list. To be frank, he's good.

273
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:07,050
You won't stand a chance against him. You're as good as dead. What's it going to be cowboy?

274
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:16,730
Put me in coach. All right, please transfer 150,000 LB dollars. What? 150,000 LBs?

275
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:22,650
Your entry fee, my overhead costs. Don't tell me that you were not expecting so many zeros on

276
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:27,530
that price or that I am ripping you off or some shit. We have an elite staff in the thousands.

277
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:35,769
150,000 dollars. Okay, I gotcha. But you really think I got that kind of dough on me? What the

278
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:41,769
hell am I supposed to do? You are supposed to do your job. You've been hired to kill someone. So

279
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:46,650
just do it and quit your whining. Plus on the job, turning in would be good for you.

280
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:52,170
If you're interested, I can introduce you to an agent. Coconut time. But really,

281
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:59,050
they're racers. I'll tell you where it is later. I'm running late for my facial. Catch up later,

282
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:15,690
Kay. What? No. That's the scream. There it is. What a distinctive voice. You can take on assassin

283
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,849
missions from Kay Entertainment, earn enough money to enter the next ranking battle.

284
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:29,139
Yeah, so there's, here's your open world. Not much of an open world. It's kind of just a map

285
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:36,460
to go do things. But yeah, we'll just do this. Make some money. Go do the facial. I can't.

286
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:45,860
Members only, we only need high ranking assassins. If you don't have an introduction

287
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,420
ticket, please leave now. We only offer work to those who have proven themselves as hard workers.

288
00:50:50,500 --> 00:51:02,659
May you find your true path. I'm not good enough. Now, apparently not skilled.

289
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,139
The job center is now open. You can take on part-time job missions from the job center.

290
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,659
Earn enough money to enter the next battle. Press the one button to call your bike.

291
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:19,539
Sit next to your bike and press the A button to get on. Yep, yep, yep. Press two to change the

292
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:28,739
mini maps display. Let's get the bike here. All right. Yeah, you have to actually go do

293
00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:38,139
just part-time. Who the fuck is this? All right. Give me a sec. I have to let Otto,

294
00:51:40,059 --> 00:52:15,369
let Otto out of the room. Hold on. He wants to get out. You can't be in here. Well,

295
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:18,650
then he wanted to get out. He was like, let me out, Cheruby. And I was like, okay.

296
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:28,940
So he can leave. He's, he's free to roam where he pleases. All right, let's go get on a bike.

297
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:42,889
Here's the real test. It didn't run so much better. Let's go check out the jobs. I mean,

298
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:48,650
it's still pretty janky, but those of you that played the original actual original hardware,

299
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:57,960
this was horrible. This is way better. Yeah, like by probably by 10,000%.

300
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:23,929
Let's go to the job center. Get off. The sharp turns are fun though. Yeah, they can be.

301
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:32,039
How much money do I have right now? There's no blood in the Japanese version.

302
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:38,469
Really? Why are you here, third raider? This is a place where third raiders get together.

303
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:44,230
So you're a member. Well, I'll teach you some good stuff. All first raiders in the world were

304
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:50,230
once third raiders. So third class is the first step up the ladder. First class. Your life will

305
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:55,590
change if you work here. I'll tell you one more thing. How to third raiders become first raiders.

306
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,710
It's easy. They worked their butts off till they were puking blood and then work some more.

307
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:07,340
Want to be a first raider? All right, just work hard. You chalk up jobs to survive in this town.

308
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:11,739
I'll hook you up with some more work if you do this job well. The job has been posted on the

309
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:20,250
golden board. Just work hard. Here it is. Coconut collector. Collect coconuts perform a rolling

310
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:27,480
sobat against a palm tree to make coconuts fall. Here we go. $2,000 for each delivery.

311
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:39,929
Yeah, this part of the game sucks, but I'm going to enjoy it because it's nostalgia. Take it over.

312
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:56,820
Okay, the client head to the client point marked on the map. Let's go. I think, yeah, if I smacked

313
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:03,619
the weed, if I, I think I can go faster if I double tap and then like, that's jump.

314
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:19,239
Just like in GTA. Here we are. We're here. You can drift too. Yeah. Wow, Jeremy, this is such an

315
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:25,769
interesting Minecraft house. Thanks, mom. The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy are okay,

316
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:30,250
but the coconuts of Santa Destroy are more my thing. Coconuts from these parts fetch a high

317
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:36,250
price. This town is built on coconuts. Coconuts are worth more than human life. Coconuts are

318
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:43,079
God, so gather them now. Gather coconuts and give them to the storekeeper. Use combo attacks on the

319
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:48,039
palm trees to make the coconuts fall. Press the A button repeatedly when carrying coconuts to walk

320
00:55:48,039 --> 00:56:15,849
faster. Here we go. Get the coconut. How many can you hold? One or two? Three? Go, go, go, go,

321
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:34,099
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. That's the way. Any more in this tree? No, no, no, I gotta go.

322
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:47,300
This is a strand game. It's easy. Why would that? That's not, that makes no sense. All right,

323
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:58,309
I gotta get three at a time. Get in front of it, please. Oh my God. What the fuck is going on?

324
00:56:58,309 --> 00:57:19,219
Why can I hit that one? What? No, don't pick this one up. I want the, whatever. That's the way.

325
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:31,579
I want to get like two or three of them to drop. Let's do this. No, there we go. Grab them.

326
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:53,780
It's easy. I get 2000 bucks for each one of these. At least I'm good at running. I'm still

327
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,699
got a full minute. More than 15 or 10 is good. Okay. Nothing on that one. Nothing on that one.

328
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:27,429
Nothing on that one. Come on. Come on. Coconut brain. I should be able to do two more deliveries.

329
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:44,579
The other side, the closer trees. Right. I see. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're

330
00:58:44,579 --> 00:59:11,380
right. I can get one more coconut. Okay. I got 11. That's like a shitload of money. $22,000.

331
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:17,239
That's a gold rank. That's not like a silver rank. It's got a gold rank. I can get platinum rank.

332
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:21,239
I'll try. I'm gonna do that one again. Hey, you third rater. I've got another job for you.

333
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:25,480
Something a little shadier, perhaps, but work all the same. I've sent an introduction ticket

334
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,119
to my associate. The road becoming a first rater is long and hard. Get your ass in gear.

335
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:37,369
Hey, you third grader. You want to be a... That doesn't make any sense. Hey, you third grader.

336
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:43,610
Want to be a first grader? Oh, nice. Okay. An assassination mission. A brand new free

337
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:55,670
fight mission can now be selected. Ah. Time to kick some ass. Free fights suck.

338
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:02,460
It's better than carrying coconuts. There's a list of jobs in my current rank. Here we go.

339
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,820
Assassination gig one. Pizza butt. Chain restaurant pizza butt plans to open up in Santa

340
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:15,380
Destroy to crush their plans. Kill pizza butts CEO. Or a snake haul. Kill until you die. Mission

341
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:34,659
ends when your life runs out. Two thousand thirty thousand dollars. Do this one. I could do this

342
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:42,099
one clean. Kill someone. Thirty thousand dollars. Collect eleven coconuts. Twenty two thousand

343
01:00:42,099 --> 01:01:16,780
dollars. Yeah. All right. Speed it up. I didn't even hit that guy. These corners. You can't just

344
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:29,699
turn on it down. Let me just try and hold. Yeah. Z is boost. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is boost.

345
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:43,670
You got it. Uh, where is it? Right here? On the other side? I don't think I can jump over this.

346
01:01:44,389 --> 01:02:04,019
Can I? Shit. I gotta go down there. Oh, right. That's how you do it. That's how you do it. You

347
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:12,710
go really fast and you can instantly stop. I forget how I just did that. Oh, shit. Okay.

348
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:21,980
I wish I had some sourdough pizza. That sounds like bad. Is that actually good?

349
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:35,050
Sourdough pizza? Wouldn't it be too chewy and weird? All right, let's go.

350
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:41,320
This is my favorite part of the whole game. That part.

351
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,889
Three, two, one.

352
01:02:48,710 --> 01:03:06,539
Just fucking burger boy. No, no, no. Don't burger boy. Get them all. Oh, let's do it sideways.

353
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:40,889
God damn it. I would have hit like five people. Shit. Guns at me. I have 10 seconds. I gotta go.

354
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,050
Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

355
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:59,639
I didn't forget about the time. I forgot about the time. All right. Let's do it again. Let's

356
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:07,030
do it again. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. Oh, shit. I forgot. I forgot. You have to go get

357
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,349
you. You have to... I forgot. I forgot. That's the worst part of all this game. You have to go get

358
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:15,670
it again. Okay. You gotta go back and get it again. Fuck. I forgot about this part. That part. This

359
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:30,340
part sucked. As far as the worst. You actually have to go get the mission again. Jesus Christ.

360
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:42,219
Damn it. I forgot about that. Yeah. You can't, you can't mess around. If I had only swung left to

361
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:51,480
right, if I was able to swing left to right, that would have been perfect. I'll get it this time.

362
01:04:52,199 --> 01:05:11,449
I think I hit that lady, I guess. Kick the dumpsters? Oh, yeah. That's right. You can't

363
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:22,170
kick the dumpsters. What side is this on? This side. Oh, shit. I almost had it. All right. You

364
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:40,170
gotta, I gotta be real quick with this. You only have 30 seconds. Welcome, Travis. Uh-huh. Pizza

365
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:51,940
butt. Let's go. I bet you can't do this in 30 seconds. I will do this in 30 seconds. I promise.

366
01:05:52,579 --> 01:06:00,809
Don't forget to use the charge attacks. Uh, do I have those on? Do you have to unlock those?

367
01:06:01,449 --> 01:06:41,559
Let's do it. Straight down here. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Pizza butt. All right.

368
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:52,980
This is the one. Better ingredients, better pizza. Pizza butt. 30 seconds. Don't fuck around. Go

369
01:06:52,980 --> 01:07:12,710
right in. Go right in and kill everybody. Hurry and quick. Get in. Go. That's what I wanted. Right

370
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:41,030
there. This is the one. Left to right, left to right, left to right. Ah. German suplex right in

371
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:56,599
his neck. Dead. Just kill the dude? Yeah, but if you, if you kill, you get bonuses if you kill more

372
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:04,010
people. I got a bronze for that because I didn't kill everybody. If you got time, kill everybody.

373
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:13,769
You have enough money for the entrance fee for the next ranking battle. Make the payment at an ATM.

374
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:34,359
I got $158,000. Buy shirts and stuff. Yeah, but one of the things that happens to you in this game,

375
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,359
in this whole series, is you'll have enough money to do the next entrance to the assassination

376
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:44,899
that you'll buy like five t-shirts and have to collect coconuts for two hours.

377
01:08:45,699 --> 01:09:13,560
I don't even hate you. Do it anyways. $2,000 on that one. $2,000 on that one. Why would you throw

378
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:23,720
$2,000 away? Basketball? What is that? Found a lovikov ball. What the hell? What is that?

379
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:47,340
I don't remember that. My bike. Dumpster diving. Yeah. It's a Japanese game, right? So that's,

380
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:56,819
that's like 20 bucks. Is this? All right, let's make the deposit.

381
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:28,229
Is he actually using a Wii controller? Yes, I am. $150,000 deposit. Why am I using a Wii

382
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:36,649
controller? Because I have to. This game has like a gyro feature that has the up and down and left

383
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:48,460
and right swinging and you just hit the mic. Just throw a wad into the ATM. All right, I'm good.

384
01:10:49,260 --> 01:11:12,649
Can you please turn up your mic volume? Uh, it should be up. Is that better? Can you hear

385
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:22,220
me now? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Your mic is fine. That's just, I just got hurt.

386
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,930
All right, where do I have to go? I was looking to chat. Get back to the house, right? And answer

387
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:40,439
the phone. My home is inside of get out of the way. Yeah, it's like my, my, my house is the hotel.

388
01:11:40,439 --> 01:11:57,770
I forgot. I know the mic isn't muted. Yeah. Bring, bring that shit back to like 2013 Twitch.

389
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:16,460
Oh wait, what's this? Preparing. Oh, it's not open yet, right? It's not open yet. Why did I just go

390
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:31,819
in the fuck? Look at chat. You're muted. Wow. Oh yeah. You want me to prove I'm not muted?

391
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:38,149
You guys could be like, Oh, just don't say anything. Just don't react to anything that he says.

392
01:12:38,149 --> 01:12:46,220
Really? You think you can keep that up? Hmm. I wonder if you can keep that up.

393
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:17,460
The Witcher three is not a good game. See, I told you. I told you just say something.

394
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:24,409
We're actually, that's wrong. You're wrong. Yeah. You're not a very good at a,

395
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:42,890
you're not a very good stealth artist. I never even played the Witcher three.

396
01:13:43,609 --> 01:13:46,949
I know it's supposed to be legendary, but let me tell you something.

397
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:52,630
I played the Witcher one and it didn't get it. And I was like, Oh, this is kind of cool. I guess.

398
01:13:53,590 --> 01:14:00,300
And gave up on, I think it was the Witcher two after two hours of playing it because every time

399
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:04,300
you opened a door in the Witcher two, you had to sit at a loading screen for two to three straight

400
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:12,810
minutes every single time. So I was like, I want to play this game. I think eventually they fixed

401
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:20,409
all that, but I never played them. Really. I played a little bit of them. I got it. Maybe

402
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:27,340
I got to go back and give it a chance because I've heard they are fantastic. Save the cat.

403
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:46,340
The cat is fine. Wait, there's other, what are the controls? Oh, any button just, we're just like

404
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:54,550
vibing right now. Right. Witcher one didn't age well. And that was, that was, that was back when

405
01:14:54,550 --> 01:15:01,689
it was almost like a rhythm game, right? Wasn't the combat, you had to click, try to click, click,

406
01:15:01,689 --> 01:15:07,420
click, click. It was weird. It was, it was different. You had to like time your clicks, almost

407
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:16,180
like it was a rhythm game. I remember, I remember not hating that though. I thought it was interesting.

408
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:29,880
All right. Let me get healed. Three's not like that. Yeah, I know. Maybe one day I'll give it all

409
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,380
a chance and play it all. Cause I, you know, I don't want to look, I don't want to be one of

410
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:41,779
those bandwagon assholes that plays cyberpunk and goes, wow, what an incredible studio. Oh,

411
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:46,100
I'm such a fan. Been such a fan for so long. What a great studio. I love this studio.

412
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:51,420
And like I played 10 minutes of the Witcher and I was like, I just can't, I don't like this.

413
01:15:52,220 --> 01:16:01,539
What's the studio? What's this timing stuff? Whoa. Cyberpunk. Wow. Who made this? Oh,

414
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:12,039
all right. I need to go. No, I'm not putting a shirt on and nothing else I can do. It didn't

415
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:17,289
unlock anything. I'm going to save it though. Is this, it's freaking me out. Is it weird that I

416
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:28,229
have to go to the bathroom every time I see him do this? Like I, it makes me need to pee.

417
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:47,779
That's weird. Do I have any message or anything on the telephone? All right, let's go. Bye Gene.

418
01:16:48,739 --> 01:17:02,680
Is this game on steam? That is not. Unfortunately, I don't know why. Ranking battle nine is now open.

419
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:08,729
Uh, so this is grasshopper, grasshopper and Ubisoft, right? Ubisoft, I believe,

420
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:18,979
has the rights to this game. This is an Ubisoft published game with no more heroes three coming

421
01:17:18,979 --> 01:17:30,020
out. You think that they would, I'm surprised there's not a no, no more heroes and no more

422
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:36,729
heroes to remaster coming out before, right? I feel like they would have to do that because they

423
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:41,930
did a port for PS3. It was one game. It was this one. They ported it to PS3. They didn't do the

424
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:46,739
second one. The second one's still only on Wii. It's just kind of all over the place. Like it

425
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:53,060
would be nice to have it in one spot that was remastered. I think they were actually talking

426
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:57,539
about remastering them or porting them or something, but it was like an off-handed random comment in

427
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:03,939
an interview that I think that Suda did a lot like, like a year ago, right? Like yeah, we would love

428
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:15,689
to do that, but it is not like real. Like we're going to do that. I think it would be in their

429
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:29,100
best interest though, because some people would buy it. Two is better than one. Two is definitely

430
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:34,500
cleaner than one. They fixed all the kind of annoying bullshit that is in this game,

431
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:42,229
but I still think this game's really good. I still like this one. All right, here we go.

432
01:18:43,029 --> 01:19:03,739
Listen. Yeah, they're all good. Yeah. Dr. Peace. There it is. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

433
01:19:04,699 --> 01:19:08,300
I knew that was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen. Kill him.

434
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:30,810
You knew it was going to happen at least once. All right. These guys are all baseball players.

435
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:42,260
I remember when I wasn't walking low, he would break. Two had better bosses, but the story was

436
01:19:42,260 --> 01:20:07,319
bland. Looks like the story in three might be pretty cool. If that trailer was any indicator,

437
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:13,430
it's going to be fucking crazy. Although the story, does the story really matter that much

438
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:20,460
in a game like this? You know what I'm saying? It's just fun and just has, it's just an interesting

439
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:30,069
concept. It does. Well, to an extent, I would say, yeah, but you're an assassin. You're climbing

440
01:20:30,069 --> 01:20:50,260
the assassin ladder. That's all the info that I need to have fun. He's backtracking. Wait, what?

441
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:56,899
Because I don't think the story matters for me in this game. How's that backtracking? I still

442
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:09,479
stand by that. Backtracking. Oh, backtracking Barry at it again. I don't think the story matters in

443
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:14,039
this game. Looks over at chat. Fucking, what are you talking about? You idiot. Stupid. Whoa,

444
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:18,439
is he serious? No way. Oh, I'm going to unfollow. Well, you know, the thing is,

445
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:23,399
if you think the story is cool, then that's fine. But I don't, I mean, I think the story is cool.

446
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:35,819
I just don't, I mean, for me personally, in my personal opinion, unfollowed and reported.

447
01:21:36,779 --> 01:21:44,470
Wait, did I get everything? I mean, just the story in general, I'm not going to be backtracking

448
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:49,909
Barry anymore. All right. I love this game's atmosphere and this game's setting and this game's

449
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:53,670
whole thing that's going on. I don't, like, I'm not going to, I'm not going to be backtracking

450
01:21:53,670 --> 01:22:03,979
Barry anymore. I'm just telling you that I love Travis. I keep backpedaling. I misspoke. I really

451
01:22:03,979 --> 01:22:10,229
did. Let me just, let me correct my gap. This game is fucking awesome. And the setting, fuck I'm,

452
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:19,130
this is like my favorite game made for the Wii. Like one of my favorite games,

453
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:32,789
one of my favorite franchises. What am I supposed to say? Get out of here.

454
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:59,850
Now fuck, can I turn up the music? No, I can't. If I turn the music down and I turn it back up,

455
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:16,260
I'll be backtracking on that too. Oh, this is, I remember this part. You got to hit the ball,

456
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:23,380
controls, hold up the Wiimote to prepare the beam katana, swing the Wiimote like a bat,

457
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:27,779
hit the ball and send it flying. The strength of your swing will affect the speed of the ball.

458
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:41,850
Hit the balls to defeat enemies. Three balls will be thrown. I thought I was going to get it first

459
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:55,779
try. I'm scared to do it hard because I don't want to hit you. I'm going to pee my pants.

460
01:23:56,579 --> 01:24:12,779
I don't know what it is about peeing, but I'll do it at the same point. Backpedaling. No,

461
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:17,340
all right. You know that I like a game when like I won't go to the bathroom.

462
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:44,979
I'm like a fucking three-year-old. That's a lot of money. Yes, I am. Get him.

463
01:24:51,369 --> 01:24:55,689
Show off the charge attack. I don't think, I don't, I'm not sure I have it. I'll try.

464
01:24:56,649 --> 01:25:17,699
Does it have to be a full battery? Yeah, I'm not sure I have it. Oh, I do. Oh, it took a lot of

465
01:25:17,699 --> 01:25:41,130
battery. Oh, fuck. That's actually pretty cool. Losing a lot of battery. Nice. It does, this is a

466
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:48,470
lot of battery though. Do some wrestling finishers. I only have one wrestling finisher at the moment.

467
01:25:48,869 --> 01:26:08,060
Yes. Or I think maybe two. Did I get all the goodies? I believe I did. Turn on the webcam

468
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:47,579
for one of those. I'll do it eventually. Get him both. Yes. There he is. Come on, knock him out.

469
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,520
Low, low, low, high, high, high, high, high, high, high. Boom, bang, boom.

470
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:23,189
Boom. Just kill him. Somebody said I should play Lollipop Chainsaw, but here's the problem

471
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:30,310
though. I love No More Heroes. Am I going to judge Lollipop Chainsaw unfairly because of how

472
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:38,039
much I love these games? I probably will. All right, let's get it out. Let's get in one go.

473
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:53,029
Yeah, I know how to do it. I'm standing back for this. Holy shit. I almost just peed. I almost did.

474
01:27:53,989 --> 01:28:18,949
Oh my God. I almost just peed. I swear to God. Yeah, I'll be right back. That came out. That ball

475
01:28:18,949 --> 01:31:10,470
was thrown so fast. I got to check. Okay. Damn. All right. He really did pee his pants. No,

476
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:16,090
that's not why that took a little while. It's because there was a lot in there.

477
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:30,250
Oh, I didn't pee my pants. I would tell you guys that. Do you think I would hold that information

478
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:36,760
from you? Of all the strange things you've heard me say, you think me telling you I didn't pee my

479
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:47,109
you know, you think I'm going to lie about that? Please don't tell us that.

480
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:55,939
All right. Oh yeah. Probably shouldn't. Yeah, I probably shouldn't.

481
01:32:11,739 --> 01:32:19,960
Backtracking. Oh, all right. This is going to be tricky. Oh, I thought I timed it.

482
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:42,060
Oh, damn it. Just tracking. What does that even mean?

483
01:32:45,100 --> 01:33:15,960
Pee pants, Peter. Relax. Whoa, camera. Oh, I got him. Where am I? What? Oh, shit. I had a chance.

484
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:27,289
Proof of peeing your pants. You can't prove somebody peed their pants by

485
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:38,359
muting my mic and left the room. Show your pants. But how do you know I didn't change my pants?

486
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:51,640
You know, I could have paused to come back with new pants on. I said exactly. Yeah, but

487
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:57,319
then why would I need to turn on my webcam and show you my pants? Oh, there's nothing in here.

488
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,680
I gotta charge this.

489
01:34:11,819 --> 01:34:31,930
I got one. All right. Stop using all my battery. Get up. What is this? What are you doing?

490
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:41,350
All right. You, you. When I look over here sometimes, I see a sea of clickable purple

491
01:34:41,350 --> 01:35:11,210
links. I get nervous. It's you peeing your pants. No, it's me. I know that. I don't even know. I

492
01:35:11,210 --> 01:35:15,770
don't have to click it. I know what it is. Let me explain to everybody that keeps putting that

493
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:25,579
image in for the last like two or three months. There's such things guys as like mustard and oil

494
01:35:25,579 --> 01:35:32,859
and eating at a restaurant and putting your finger on your pants after you eat like a pulled pork

495
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:50,119
sandwich. Why would I pee my pants? And what? Who cares? No, stop talking about food. This,

496
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:55,020
I'm not, this is not going to be an hour and 25 minutes screen. Every time you talk about food,

497
01:35:55,020 --> 01:36:07,109
it all gets fucked up. No, stop saying no. I got diarrhea last night from the pizza. So I'm not,

498
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:12,920
I don't want, that's not going to work. The worst part about this is I don't know if it was the

499
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:41,579
pizza or putting the Wiimote in my mouth. True story. Get out of here. Two lightsaber duels.

500
01:36:45,829 --> 01:37:00,420
Shit, that hurts. Get him boy. Oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

501
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:06,859
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,

502
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:16,619
kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill. That's it. I got everything right.

503
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,649
Psycho. I'm like, cause I was going kill, kill, kill, kill. All right. Let's see if this works.

504
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:47,529
Does it, can you guys hear it? Let's find out. Yeah. The moment you step onto the field,

505
01:37:47,529 --> 01:37:56,409
the fight begins. If you win, you will be ranked ninth. If you lose, well, there's no need to go

506
01:37:56,409 --> 01:38:05,770
into that. If you pop a breath, hit the restroom, brush your teeth. When you are ready, step inside.

507
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:15,609
Your chances of survival are slim, but trust your force and head for the garden of madness.

508
01:38:17,539 --> 01:38:25,350
Okay. How come I never say anything back? Actual Star Wars game.

509
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:45,529
Okay. New move. Coming up. Travis, you've made some progress. I caught the podcast that said

510
01:38:45,529 --> 01:38:51,529
you're getting your edge back. Do you remember your second suplex? Terrifying trip to the moon,

511
01:38:51,529 --> 01:39:00,170
the reverse arm salt. You remember no professional wrestling move. Uh, am I going to get full health?

512
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:23,109
I think you do. This is an Xbox game. This is a Wii game. Only for the Wii. Well, no, that's not

513
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:28,279
true. It is an Xbox game, but that one, it only came out in Japan to the next box. I've been,

514
01:39:28,279 --> 01:39:35,130
by the way, why? So there's a PS3 remake or remaster of this game and it came out on

515
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:45,380
Xbox 360 as well, but only in Japan for 360. Weird. All right. Number nine. Here we go.

516
01:39:45,939 --> 01:40:31,079
The ballpark.

517
01:40:34,329 --> 01:40:39,130
Nice set of pipes you got there old man and nice golden guns.

518
01:40:51,689 --> 01:40:57,289
Courtesy of me and my entry fee. No doubt. My ex-wife called me the other day and I

519
01:40:57,289 --> 01:41:02,890
met my daughter for the first time in 10 years. We dined at a fancy restaurant.

520
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:07,689
One of those that are impossible to get a reservation for. And then afterwards,

521
01:41:07,689 --> 01:41:14,729
karaoke. Who got you the reservation? The association took care of it. Of course.

522
01:41:14,729 --> 01:41:24,840
Yes. Fuck my entry fee. $150,000 is not the fact the reservations are hard to get.

523
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:33,239
In fact, no one gets reservations. The words reservations only apply only to those outside

524
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:38,920
of the circle. It's getting into that circle matters. And the food good.

525
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:50,390
Unfortunately, the atmosphere was a facade. Not once did my own daughter look me in the eye.

526
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:57,979
This guy's food tasted like blood. You're a junkie for blood, old man.

527
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:04,069
Nipples. You just did this there. It's just a bear.

528
01:42:05,609 --> 01:42:15,850
People like us, we're shocked. You smell blood too, didn't you?

529
01:42:15,850 --> 01:42:21,050
You got it, old man. And for some reason, I feel this sense of euphoria.

530
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:27,380
Don't die on me too quickly. I want to gorge myself.

531
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:32,180
This guy shoots. You gotta watch out for the projectiles.

532
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:39,140
Man, this is what I live for. Fighting your own kind. Nothing's more gratifying.

533
01:42:40,340 --> 01:42:42,020
See you on the other side.

534
01:42:42,659 --> 01:42:44,819
All right, do I have to?

535
01:42:54,199 --> 01:43:03,579
Not that easy, Travis. All right, here we go. Can I do that? I think I have to block.

536
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:26,380
Good music coming up. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Block low, block high. Oh. Block low, block high.

537
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:50,569
Block low. Oh, fuck. Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

538
01:43:50,569 --> 01:43:59,979
He's not gonna kill me. All right, back up, back up. Wait till he shoots. All right,

539
01:43:59,979 --> 01:44:20,300
when he goes down to his knees, it's low. Can't block these. All right, I got it.

540
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:53,210
More. How many more? Oh, fuck. He's gonna change up. He's gonna go to the next phase

541
01:44:53,210 --> 01:45:13,979
here in a second. Oh, fuck. I got it. I got it. Get it. Oh, shit. He does more than that.

542
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:50,890
All right, I'm fine. I can't knock him down. Jesus Christ.

543
01:45:50,890 --> 01:46:25,930
Get him. Back it up. I need health. I'm fine. Oh, my fucking God, I have no battery. I have

544
01:46:25,930 --> 01:47:09,529
to wait till he does a big one. Oh, shit. Kill, kill, kill. Oh, don't get hit. I'm trying to get

545
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:21,899
another Breastland move on him. Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up. Don't

546
01:47:21,899 --> 01:47:44,649
be an idiot. What's he doing? What's the next phase? I know there's one more thing he does, I think.

547
01:47:45,289 --> 01:48:17,289
We're good. He's dead. If I ever found out Jerm was secretly serial kill, I wouldn't have trouble

548
01:48:17,289 --> 01:48:34,090
believing it. What are you talking about? Wow, this guy's a chump. That probably would have

549
01:48:34,090 --> 01:49:16,069
killed me if I didn't walk high. I need to stop being an idiot. He's dead. One more. Oh, fuck.

550
01:49:16,069 --> 01:49:42,180
Don't be an idiot. Don't be an idiot. Holy shit. He's a fucking idiot. What? Yeah, he's dead.

551
01:49:44,649 --> 01:49:54,140
Don't kid yourself. Playtime is over. Oh, I think you have to. Uh oh. Do I actually have to do this?

552
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:33,880
Oh, no. Do I? I, I thought, did I? All right, let's get him. Let's get him. Let's get him. Let's get

553
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:40,359
him. Let's get him. Let's get him. I thought I had to just press A, but did I though? Because

554
01:50:41,079 --> 01:50:49,260
he, I thought I had to wait for him. I thought, but that'd be, don't worry, I'll make it quick.

555
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:26,520
Just fucking spam him. Oh, fuck. You actually don't have to dodge it. Bloodborne boss health. Yeah,

556
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:34,489
it's, it, I can't believe I lost. I can't believe I lost. I thought I had to wait for like him to

557
01:51:34,489 --> 01:52:06,789
pull an eye pull. Spin wheel with a gun. Look, he's already at 30%. We're good. Die to gun wheel.

558
01:52:06,789 --> 01:52:34,069
No, this is not gun wheel. Can I dive? I wonder if I can go through that. Battery. Can I dive

559
01:52:34,069 --> 01:52:44,020
through that? Maybe. I'm too afraid to try it. You lost a doctor piss.

560
01:52:53,539 --> 01:53:27,140
Come on, knock him down. Shit. Jesus. Need to recover quick. I feel like you guys can hear that

561
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:44,869
and you can feel it. Can you hear the wind I'm generating with that? I feel it in my bones.

562
01:53:45,829 --> 01:54:03,859
How would I do that? You can't even hurt him when he's like that. All right, close. It's close. It's

563
01:54:03,859 --> 01:54:31,829
close. I'm not going to fuck it up this time. Give me it. Give it to me. I'm going to go. All

564
01:54:31,829 --> 01:54:45,590
right, hold on. I can't. I thought I could charge up and do it. All right, we're good. Let's press

565
01:54:45,590 --> 01:55:24,539
A next time. Get it. Get it. Get him. Battery, battery, battery, battery, battery, battery, battery.

566
01:55:30,489 --> 01:56:28,470
Good. It's not so bad. Okay. Oh my God. Don't die. That was a gnome. All right, there we go.

567
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:32,220
Just press A. Press A. I have to just press A.

568
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:59,979
Okay, it's A. Got it. I thought I had to go. I can't believe I fucked that up.

569
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:27,020
That's the easiest QTE. I forgot it was a QTE. I thought it was just the guy. I thought I had

570
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:45,130
to wait for him to start to draw or I would fail the mission. I don't know. Travis, that's rude.

571
01:57:45,770 --> 01:58:07,430
Like the only reason why I get C rank is because I had to restart. 150k. Max health has increased.

572
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:27,500
What is this? What is this spoiler? I don't understand. I want to go see that movie by the

573
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:40,100
way. Isn't that movie like apparently one of the worst movies ever made? Didn't they remake CGI on

574
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:43,380
it because they desperately were like, holy shit, this has like six on Rotten Tomatoes.

575
01:58:57,239 --> 01:59:39,659
It was a patch. Day one movie patch. Marvelous. Dr. Peace. Am I going to do Katana's upgrades?

576
01:59:39,659 --> 01:59:47,020
Yeah, I think I unlock that now actually. I think I get that now. I think this is when the

577
01:59:47,020 --> 02:00:13,670
store is open. Scott Pilgrim ripoff porn game. No, no, I'm sorry. Hi, this is Diane from Beefhead

578
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:19,989
Videos. This is a message from Mr. Travis Touchdown. Just calling to remind you that you haven't

579
02:00:19,989 --> 02:00:30,069
returned one of our rentals. Big German jugs collection number 23. Be sure to return it soon.

580
02:00:30,069 --> 02:00:34,310
Have a nice day. Do you guys, I don't know if you guys remember Blockbuster video,

581
02:00:35,670 --> 02:00:38,470
but do you remember there was a back room at Blockbuster?

582
02:00:40,869 --> 02:00:41,909
And it was the porn room.

583
02:00:41,909 --> 02:00:48,310
Very much for your cooperation. In addition, we have faxed you some information about the rankings

584
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:55,029
in case you wish to continue your ascent. As a friendly reminder, there will be a small nominal

585
02:00:55,029 --> 02:00:59,590
fee to participate in ranked fights. It was like another, and there was another, you went into the

586
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:13,779
main store and then there was the pornography section that was behind another door. I'm not

587
02:01:13,779 --> 02:01:19,779
making this up. Is this the same, is this the right video store? Blockbuster porn room.

588
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:50,539
Which, wait, what video store had the porn room? Okay, hold on. Yeah, yeah, no, this is real.

589
02:01:55,829 --> 02:01:59,189
Right by the anime section, they had this little curtain that went into the adult section. The

590
02:01:59,189 --> 02:02:02,949
place would be pretty open pretty late at night. And as I got into my late teens, it wouldn't be

591
02:02:02,949 --> 02:02:07,189
uncommon for my friends and I to be there past midnight on weekends playing fighting games.

592
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:10,550
It was then that I learned that the place stayed alive because of its porn clientele.

593
02:02:11,189 --> 02:02:15,510
During the late night hours, a barrage of men would walk behind that curtain and walk out

594
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:19,510
with stacks of porn to rent. It was nuts. Literally the busiest time you'd see at the

595
02:02:19,510 --> 02:02:30,340
rental counter. So, no, this is real. I guess it wasn't Blockbuster, but it was other just like

596
02:02:30,340 --> 02:02:43,989
rental stores. That's not a lie. There was a secret porn room at a bunch of rental places.

597
02:02:44,789 --> 02:02:56,380
All right, $200,000 deposit signed. Travis Touchdown. Not at Blockbuster. Yeah, but,

598
02:02:57,340 --> 02:03:04,060
is it a lie if I'm saying it in the same two sentences? Wait, no, maybe it wasn't. Let me

599
02:03:04,060 --> 02:03:09,109
check. No, a lie would be like, no, it is Blockbuster. It's Blockbuster. And then

600
02:03:09,109 --> 02:03:15,659
six days go by and I go, no, and my Blockbuster had it. That would be me lying to you. This is

601
02:03:15,659 --> 02:03:22,920
me trying to get my facts straight in the same two sentences. I'm just gonna play the damn cat.

602
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:52,890
Hey, girl. That's a little cat. Save it. Do I have any more videos? I don't think I do.

603
02:03:53,529 --> 02:03:59,909
I'm gonna unlock some new jobs, I think. How much money do I have? Like 150, 160?

604
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:26,359
Yeah, we're good. Now, let me see if I can actually buy some shit. Naomi's Lab is now open.

605
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:34,199
Thunder Ryu building is now open. Area 51 is now open. A new part-time job is now available.

606
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:51,560
All right. Very, very cool. Let's go. I need $200,000. Let's go to the katanas first. This

607
02:04:51,560 --> 02:05:04,460
game is fucking awesome. Yeah. Oh, it is. It's fantastic. To pay no attention to that.

608
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:26,310
All right. It's back there. Yeah, it's ready. Lift up the remote to jump. Yeah, I've jumped a few

609
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:38,569
times. Play a single finger on anything. What do we got? Oh, it's you again. Something to drink.

610
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:52,279
Weapons. The Tsubaki. $98,000. Beam katana created by Naomi. The prototype model. What about parts?

611
02:05:53,670 --> 02:06:04,619
Accelerator. Beam katana accelerator. A sensor that can locate buried treasure when

612
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:19,689
attached to the beam katana. Pretty cool. Let's get the new weapon. Yes. And let's get the weapon

613
02:06:19,689 --> 02:06:42,359
part too. I want to find buried treasure. Now I have no money. I wonder what color is this one?

614
02:06:44,729 --> 02:06:50,869
That one looks pretty cool. I know there's at least a handful. I gave him my motorcycle.

615
02:06:51,510 --> 02:07:04,020
Let's go check out the new jobs. Hit the dumpsters. Yeah. Did he just get on it and park it

616
02:07:04,579 --> 02:07:23,079
in the same spot that I just left it? $2,000. You can get shirts and a shirt in that dumpster.

617
02:07:25,960 --> 02:07:40,380
Actually, let me take a little look. I'll go shirt hunting. $2,000. Yeah, I need to go train.

618
02:07:40,539 --> 02:07:43,659
Actually, you can increase your attack power and shit. Yeah, that's important.

619
02:07:45,930 --> 02:08:10,579
Find seven of those balls. I got plenty of time for that. Get out of the way. Thunder Ryu building.

620
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:18,899
I can learn moves here, I believe. Other stuff. There's stuff to learn. Is this your first ever

621
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:29,000
Jerma stream? Can everybody please welcome Jonathan L1037 to the channel, please? Welcome.

622
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:36,260
Oh yeah, that. You want to do that. Get over here. I'll teach you a little something. Take off your

623
02:08:36,260 --> 02:08:41,939
clothes. Off, off. Need your clothes off to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Want to start? Get naked. Now

624
02:08:41,939 --> 02:08:47,539
stick your butt out. Out. Can't kill them unless you have strong stance. No, not your arms or hips.

625
02:08:47,539 --> 02:08:52,979
Haven't you ever taken a dump in a Japanese style toilet? Strong stance. Excellent. Just like that.

626
02:08:52,979 --> 02:09:03,699
Now you're under pants. That's okay. Keep your clothes on. All right. Dumbbell. This is strength.

627
02:09:04,659 --> 02:09:15,020
Uh, let's see what it is. Training that will extend your beam katanas combo attacks. Yes,

628
02:09:15,020 --> 02:09:22,140
that's pretty damn good. You can do them all. Increase your strength. We'll just do this one

629
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:28,840
first. I think I have to tap. I'm going to be damn good at this one. You know it. Is it A?

630
02:09:42,329 --> 02:09:49,500
It's hard to do it on the Wiimote. It's actually hard to do that on the Wiimote because it's not

631
02:09:49,899 --> 02:10:05,399
an easy button to press. That's not an easy button for me to do the vibrate on.

632
02:10:05,399 --> 02:10:32,619
You guys know what I mean by that. Let's do this one. Squats. Come on. This is bad form.

633
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:49,479
This gets way harder if I remember. Vitality increased. And now let's do this one. How do

634
02:10:49,479 --> 02:11:05,430
I do this? I think it's alternate. Come on. Is it two pounds?

635
02:11:14,329 --> 02:11:27,180
Your beam katanas combo has been extended. Nice. Oh, that already leaving already. That's

636
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:45,109
that's it. Come again. This dude didn't even re-rack. Oh, fuck. Didn't wipe down equipment.

637
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:51,109
That was okay. Re-racking. If people just throw 30 pound weights around and just leave them in

638
02:11:51,109 --> 02:12:00,899
random places. I would rather have to find the dumbbells than have to sit in a seat that some

639
02:12:00,899 --> 02:12:08,890
big motherfucker sits in. It's sweating profusely. They get up and the chair is wet.

640
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:15,850
Soaking wet. I'm not going to sit on that. And then I have to go and go get the spray bottle and I

641
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:29,220
have to clean up this person's gross body liquid. Or I just walk by and I go I'm not using I'm not

642
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:49,779
doing that one today. All right here we go. Come on in brother. Don't judge a book by its cover okay.

643
02:12:50,659 --> 02:12:55,619
This is just my personal style. A man should stick to his guns you know. Make a good selection now

644
02:12:55,619 --> 02:13:01,539
bro. Be sure before you purchase okay. If you don't make up your mind soon I'll have to stop

645
02:13:01,539 --> 02:13:07,060
letting you in here bro. I'm going nuts here. I'm hard on myself and my customers but that's

646
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:18,760
just my the right way to do things you know. Okay new jacket. I want black. Yeah oh shit I don't

647
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:33,720
have any money. Heat. Radioactive. All right I'm gonna put on the banana shirt. New jeans.

648
02:13:34,439 --> 02:13:46,949
These are expensive. All right these ones. Belts. Who gives a shit about a belt? Nobody sees it.

649
02:13:46,949 --> 02:13:52,229
I know I don't get I don't get the belt thing. You can go to Walmart and get a belt for

650
02:13:53,189 --> 02:14:07,989
12 dollars. Nobody who cares about your belt. Guys I could probably unwrap a fruit by the foot

651
02:14:08,630 --> 02:14:13,750
and put it in as a belt and you probably it would take me to have to tell you that

652
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:21,529
that's what's there for you to notice it. I need different sunglasses. I don't have

653
02:14:21,529 --> 02:14:37,270
enough money for this. I want the blue ones. All right let's go. See you in another life brother.

654
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:43,979
What the fuck was that? That guy had the game like hung up for a second and that was weird.

655
02:14:44,779 --> 02:14:52,840
Hey remember all the money I just spent? Uh yeah now we have to do coconut missions for like an

656
02:14:52,840 --> 02:15:06,579
hour. If you think I'm making this up go read any review on this game. You'll see all the reviewers

657
02:15:06,579 --> 02:15:14,100
gave this game. This game got like sevens like high six low sevens when it was reviewed when it

658
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:20,970
first came up because everybody complained about having to do coconut missions for an hour.

659
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:25,899
That's because it is. No this is no that's a high seven. This is a high seven game.

660
02:15:26,939 --> 02:15:32,380
I can't I can't hear that this is this low a mid-six game. I can't I can't hear that.

661
02:15:34,649 --> 02:15:48,649
Let's do a job. This is uh this this this is a seven this is like a seven six on a on a sunny

662
02:15:48,649 --> 02:16:05,420
day. This is like seven nine on a rainy day. Third class man I have not mastered the secret

663
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:12,140
of the first class yet. What is he talking? It's not too bad. The first rated god will give a

664
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:20,180
hard-working man a little smile. Today's job has been listed on the bulletin board. Lawn mowing.

665
02:16:20,180 --> 02:16:24,020
Looking for lawn mowers cut as much grass as you can inside the required area

666
02:16:24,739 --> 02:16:29,000
within the limit. Three hundred dollars for each acre. Let's go.

667
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:40,500
Do you can still do assassin missions? Oh yeah that's right there's there's one available.

668
02:16:41,299 --> 02:17:02,680
We'll do this one first. Locate the client. Yep yep yep. Um what are the pink blips on the map?

669
02:17:03,239 --> 02:17:06,520
I don't remember what those are. All right do you think I can jump a house?

670
02:17:07,159 --> 02:17:13,139
I'm trying to jump. Why wouldn't you jump? All right we won't have enough battery.

671
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:36,549
All right don't kill the client. The blips are oh the treasure all right nice. No I won't

672
02:17:36,549 --> 02:17:49,209
get out of here. There are dreams in the unspoken rules of santa destroy. A verdant law awaits you

673
02:17:49,209 --> 02:17:53,850
in your future. Amazed like manor house with a huge pool and a brilliant green lawn.

674
02:17:54,649 --> 02:17:59,290
Just as the god of hard work handwork waits at the end of a long day's work.

675
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:06,180
The god of lawns shall smile upon all who mow them. Cut cut cut and mow.

676
02:18:09,659 --> 02:18:17,190
Handwork. Yeah this one sucks. Cut back the wildly overgrown grass.

677
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:25,450
A and B. Twist the oh I have to twist the Wiimote. Z button turns. Wait what?

678
02:18:26,569 --> 02:18:49,959
What do you mean turns? I feel like playing farmer's dynasty again. This is a generous acre.

679
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:59,979
Oh shit I have to get it at least. I have to do it the whole thing.

680
02:19:01,530 --> 02:19:08,940
This grass is so bad. This is it really is. I know this didn't even exist back then. Did it?

681
02:19:09,739 --> 02:19:14,500
This is the default unity grass. I don't even think that it does this.

682
02:19:14,500 --> 02:19:29,180
No yeah unity wasn't the thing back here. Yeah unity didn't exist.

683
02:19:29,739 --> 02:19:41,219
Maybe it did but it wasn't out to the public. Could you make a game in unity in like 2005?

684
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:59,129
It came out in 2005. Maybe. I don't know. This is gonna drop me nuts if I don't get this whole

685
02:19:59,129 --> 02:20:03,209
thing eventually. I'm gonna have to do this a few times so I can get all of it at one you know what

686
02:20:03,209 --> 02:20:27,450
I mean. Oh look at me. Look at me. Shit I'm not gonna get it all. I have to get at least 100.

687
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:48,059
No I'll get 80. 86. Damn it. How much is that worth? Coconuts are like 20 to 25 000. This is 20.

688
02:20:48,059 --> 02:20:51,739
This is is this longer than coconuts? I think this might be actually easier than coconuts.

689
02:20:53,219 --> 02:20:56,020
A third raider. I've got another job for you. Something a little shadier.

690
02:20:56,979 --> 02:21:01,780
Sent an introduction ticket. The road to becoming a first raider is long and hard. Get your ass in

691
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:10,680
here. There's better jobs. Yeah that's new assassin is available. Cool. Well put it put us right in

692
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:25,350
front of it. Let's do it. It's an easier job but it doesn't bop. Yeah I feel you. Okay we got the

693
02:21:25,350 --> 02:21:32,309
bronze on pizza butt. Snake hall 2000. 3,000. 4500 per kill. Baseball battle. Going to batting

694
02:21:32,309 --> 02:21:41,860
killing spree. Oh let's do this one. 4500 per kill. I think I just didn't play baseball.

695
02:21:42,579 --> 02:21:56,629
Jeremy you'd look a lot cuter if you were 20 years younger.

696
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:28,280
I'm sorry that age exists. Maybe one day it won't. I want to dig. Maybe one day you can live to be

697
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:47,510
like 200 and not like get saggy cheeks like I do. You'd be 14. Oh shit. Hey whoa. What the fuck?

698
02:22:58,950 --> 02:23:13,379
Fan that guy. He just did the math in his head. Where's this treasure? It's right here.

699
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:35,000
Am I not on top of it? Where is it? Got it. Well this this is where that person says,

700
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,079
oh well Jerma I thought you were 55 years old. He's like oh well that's yeah I see you making

701
02:23:41,079 --> 02:24:01,899
like a joke. You making you making fun of me. Okay it was a joke. Yeah it's a it's a you look old

702
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:11,500
joke. I'm aware of those. All right I know. The car hit boxes are huge. Yeah they're enormous.

703
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:31,510
All right let me go do this one. He's getting tired of them. No I have some really really

704
02:24:31,510 --> 02:24:40,440
important news for you guys. When you turn 30 you don't care about that anymore. Like I don't.

705
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:47,690
I know. I know. Like I don't like it doesn't bother me. After you turn 30 years old it's just like

706
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:52,329
it don't matter. I'm gonna still it's I'm getting older now. That's it. And people go wow you look

707
02:24:52,329 --> 02:24:58,090
old. I mean that's because I'm getting older. It's okay. When I was 29 I was like no I can't turn

708
02:24:58,569 --> 02:25:04,409
30. I'm gonna be old. And then the second you turn 30 it's like oh okay everything's fine.

709
02:25:06,010 --> 02:25:25,530
All right. No. You're really handsome. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

710
02:25:28,379 --> 02:25:35,129
That's a shitload of money. It's 36,000 dollars for that. I'm just doing that one again. How does it

711
02:25:35,129 --> 02:25:46,549
feel to have both feet in the grave? Oh well let's see. 30 34. Let's figure what's the average age of

712
02:25:46,790 --> 02:26:11,370
a U.S. male? What is it? Is it 80? 75 is it? Well what's the 77? 75? Okay. So now what is the

713
02:26:11,370 --> 02:26:17,620
average age of a U.S. male? Oh the shitload of medical problems. You know like I've got like

714
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:22,579
I've got like a hernia. I've got fucking colitis. I have costochondritis. Like what how low is that?

715
02:26:23,379 --> 02:26:33,420
60 65 30. All right yeah so I'm so what am I halfway dead? Oh shit.

716
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:46,920
You I don't have oh fuck I do. I've got two feet in the grave. I'm going to the beach to get this

717
02:26:46,920 --> 02:27:01,959
one. I have to get down there. Do I fear death? I'll just come back as a butterfly and fly around

718
02:27:01,959 --> 02:27:12,020
for a little bit. Yeah you could just that'd be fine. And then and then when somebody likes

719
02:27:12,020 --> 02:27:18,870
when I get squashed into somebody's windshield I'll I'll wake up again and I'll be like a fucking

720
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:24,260
ant. See that's the thing about still like oh what about like do you believe in like reincarnation?

721
02:27:24,819 --> 02:27:30,659
I mean that's a very interesting concept but how what determines there are like 600 trillion ants.

722
02:27:30,659 --> 02:27:41,110
Ants. You respawning as a human is is like 0.000000001 percent.

723
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:47,479
Like there are 600 million ants for every one person probably.

724
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:52,360
You're going to be an ant. You're going to you can respawn as an ant over and over and over and

725
02:27:52,360 --> 02:28:04,840
over again for millenniums. And then maybe you'll. Holy shit I'm a baby. Oh my god took 600 fucking

726
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:17,479
eons. I had to live with an ant like 600 trillion fucking times. Ah don't step on me. Oh fuck.

727
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:27,979
No I'm okay. The hive's being invaded by killer bees. Oh no I'm a person again.

728
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:40,549
Can you imagine having to live 500 million lifetimes as like the the worst life ever like that?

729
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:46,940
All right all right yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna carry this piece of sand

730
02:28:47,579 --> 02:28:54,299
in my mouth. Oh okay I'm gonna walk and place the sand one grain of sand down. Turn around do it

731
02:28:54,299 --> 02:29:04,170
again do another grain of sand. Do this till I'm dead. And then you respawn again. Oh fuck I gotta

732
02:29:04,170 --> 02:29:09,930
get that grain of sand. Oh let me make sure I lay down a chemical trail so my blind friends can see

733
02:29:09,930 --> 02:29:33,260
where I'm going. All right where's my fight? Reincarnation doesn't work like that.

734
02:29:33,979 --> 02:29:44,860
Yeah but I mean if it did what but if it did if it was just luck of the lottery if you

735
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:52,329
respawned 500 million times an ant the one time you respawn as an as an anteater you're gonna

736
02:29:52,329 --> 02:30:04,170
be like oh my no no no no no I can't do this. I can't do this. I know what it's like to be that

737
02:30:04,170 --> 02:30:22,979
guy. You're gonna respawn as a fish like a goldfish in a bowl and be like oh thank god

738
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:31,260
that's your cooldown period that's where you get to just chill. It's gonna seem like five minutes

739
02:30:35,020 --> 02:30:44,569
the three years that you're a goldfish in a bowl is gonna feel like five minutes. I want to go to

740
02:30:44,569 --> 02:31:03,510
the where is it how much money do I need? A lot. I want to go the other way. What's some of the new

741
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:10,309
ones? Let me try one of the other new ones. What if you get a turtle? I mean that's pretty that's

742
02:31:10,309 --> 02:31:15,590
not bad. That's pretty good. That's like a hundred years. Can't some turtles live to be like 150?

743
02:31:16,149 --> 02:31:23,829
That's not bad but it's still it does not even come close to the light years of time you'll be

744
02:31:23,829 --> 02:31:31,479
an ant or a beetle or something. Kill using wrestling moves only. No other moves are allowed

745
02:31:31,479 --> 02:31:41,819
for this mission. I'll try it. Would you want to live as a turtle? But if that's what you got it's

746
02:31:41,819 --> 02:31:55,659
better than living as an ant. Is it though? Yeah you you can like swim around and just like lie on

747
02:31:55,659 --> 02:32:02,809
a rock for six hours. You guys have a some of you guys might even own turtles. They get to just sit

748
02:32:02,809 --> 02:32:18,940
down on a rock it doesn't have the sunbeam down on them for like 14-15 hours a day. That's pretty

749
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:28,229
that's not bad that's pretty cool actually. Respawning as an ant over and over again is

750
02:32:28,229 --> 02:32:33,829
the equivalent of waking up and nuclear bombs are going off around your house all day until

751
02:32:33,829 --> 02:32:43,129
you're dead. Just every all every second it's just just mayhem. I would I could I would be able to

752
02:32:43,129 --> 02:32:55,370
I could sit on a rock for a little while as a turtle. What if you're born as a pigeon? I could

753
02:32:55,370 --> 02:33:03,209
fly. You can just fly around. Okay some of you guys that want to what do you mean be a pigeon?

754
02:33:03,930 --> 02:33:08,090
You know that a lot of that a decent amount of pigeons like fly around New York City and eat old

755
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:16,420
french fries on the ground. You that's what's wrong is that bad? What's wrong with that?

756
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:26,659
In fact that's like kind of like that's kind of how my life is now. You know like just eating

757
02:33:26,659 --> 02:33:32,069
french fries and like junk food and going you know what I mean like that doesn't sound bad.

758
02:33:37,610 --> 02:33:48,149
Only wrestling words. Pigeons are like the goats of the bird world. All right only killed with oh

759
02:33:48,149 --> 02:34:01,500
right I can only because isn't isn't a goat stomach made out of like rocks? Like can a

760
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:16,120
goat eat like a can't goats eat like anything? Isn't there like a what what no I swear to god

761
02:34:16,120 --> 02:34:23,989
there's like who has like the iron stomach? They ever anyone can eat anything. No I swear to god

762
02:34:23,989 --> 02:34:33,020
there's like something about it's some it's it's goats right? I mean they're not supposed to like

763
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:36,540
obviously you're not they're not supposed to without you know but there's something about

764
02:34:36,540 --> 02:34:46,379
the way that they process the food or something. It's called a gastrolith. I know I'm not crazy.

765
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:59,159
Hey bro they can literally eat razor wire. I didn't know that.

766
02:35:01,639 --> 02:35:26,709
That was fucking awesome. Tombstone again. Yeah. What was this 3,000 for kill?

767
02:35:27,829 --> 02:35:47,020
People are shooting guns now. Bro please bro what? Why can I not hit B? All right 13 that's an

768
02:35:47,020 --> 02:36:04,840
unlucky number. I don't like it. Ah shit. That shouldn't be bad. 30 uh 40,000. Chill bro. I'm

769
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:20,010
fine. That's well that's the first time we get to see the new sword. How much money do I got? What

770
02:36:20,010 --> 02:36:24,889
about if you spawn as a whale? All right I got 114,000. I need more money than that. Damn I need

771
02:36:24,889 --> 02:36:30,170
that shitload more. This is why you don't buy clothes until you have five million dollars.

772
02:36:31,049 --> 02:36:43,299
What are my thoughts on goat cheese? I wonder how polarizing this is going to be. I don't think it

773
02:36:43,299 --> 02:36:48,819
will be very polarizing. I'm not. I don't think it will be. I think it's disgusting. I think it

774
02:36:48,819 --> 02:36:54,899
tastes like dirt. I think it tastes like actual physical soil in the ground. Dirt. I hate it.

775
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:05,370
Third class man. I have not mastered the secret of the first class yet. It's not too bad.

776
02:37:06,569 --> 02:37:13,909
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Anyone? All right I gotta get gold on this one.

777
02:37:15,829 --> 02:37:23,110
It's way too overpowering for me. I can tell when goat cheese isn't anything. It's like the

778
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:29,129
princess lying on the mattress with the pee under it. I'll I know it's in there. If you give me even

779
02:37:29,129 --> 02:37:37,129
a tiny little crumble of goat cheese I will take a bite and just I know that there's a pee under my

780
02:37:37,129 --> 02:38:02,659
mattress. PEA guys. You guys don't know that. That's like a classic fairy tale. You think we

781
02:38:02,739 --> 02:38:11,940
don't we think we know? All right I gotta get gold on this one. But do you like cream cheese? Yes

782
02:38:12,659 --> 02:38:29,879
I do. I love cream cheese. You know forget about technique. I'm just gonna try to get as many

783
02:38:29,879 --> 02:38:53,750
acres as possible. Who cares if I don't get it all? Already much better pace than last time. Cream

784
02:38:53,750 --> 02:39:03,000
cheese is dank. Yeah I'm not I actually don't like I mean something I don't like it but I uh I'd rather

785
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:11,659
there be stuff in the cream cheese like chive onion salmon like salmon on the cream you know I

786
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:21,000
it's got to be uh dressed up a little I mean I I love it I do like it but if I had a choice

787
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:27,639
I would eat the one that had something in it. Vegetables. Vegetable medley whatever it's called

788
02:39:27,639 --> 02:39:34,299
the vegetable one where there's little carrot chunks and celery chunks. Don't make this a

789
02:39:34,299 --> 02:39:54,600
fucking three-hour stream guys. What are you doing? Get it all. There's only one more piece.

790
02:39:54,600 --> 02:40:04,020
There's one more nose hair. Trim the last nose hair. Got it. Yeah liver and cream cheese is pretty

791
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:17,299
good. I can't eat liver. I've tried chicken livers and no I can't do it. It's too it's too

792
02:40:17,299 --> 02:40:23,860
heavy for me. It has too strong of a flavor. I know it's so good for you too. I know eating

793
02:40:23,860 --> 02:40:35,239
chicken liver is new fight mission. Oh cool. Chicken livers are they're they're packed with

794
02:40:35,239 --> 02:40:46,950
so much nutrients. I know I can't do it though. It's just not for me. Would you eat cream cheese

795
02:40:46,950 --> 02:40:56,329
pizza? Uh probably not. Pizza's already heavy. I don't think I'd want to weigh pizza down even more.

796
02:40:57,129 --> 02:41:08,149
My mother used to make chicken livers all the time and I would ever I would try it every time

797
02:41:08,149 --> 02:41:22,389
and I would not like it every time. Jesus Christ. That was horrible. That was that was really bad.

798
02:41:23,270 --> 02:41:34,420
We've already had the cheese debate in this channel. I did the cheese tier list.

799
02:41:35,059 --> 02:41:44,170
I hate to bring politics into this chat but what's your opinion on stuffed crust pizzas?

800
02:41:44,889 --> 02:41:59,049
They're unbelievable. They're unbelievable. But you have to be in the mood for it. Stuffed crust

801
02:41:59,049 --> 02:42:08,069
pizza is disgusting except for the one occasion every maybe few months where you are just sitting

802
02:42:08,069 --> 02:42:13,510
on your couch and your eyes bing whip open and there's a light bulb over your head and you go

803
02:42:13,510 --> 02:42:19,110
I want a stuffed crust pizza right now. Then it's a 10 out of 10. It's apps it's the best fucking

804
02:42:19,110 --> 02:42:24,260
thing on earth when you have the light bulb and every other scenario know it's horrible

805
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:31,579
but that happens sometimes. Free fight mission kill until you take a single hit from the enemy.

806
02:42:31,579 --> 02:42:42,139
Kill them all within the time limit. Oh this is gonna be hard. Don't take damage. Use stances

807
02:42:42,139 --> 02:43:14,200
with this weapon. Now it's not embarrassing if I die. I mean it would be but not even. Cross.

808
02:43:15,159 --> 02:43:35,190
Yes. Crossing. He's still alive. He's still alive. That guy's still alive.

809
02:43:49,139 --> 02:44:08,790
Greedy. All right I'll take 10. I'll take 10 kills. Now it's gonna get. Oh I did it. There we go.

810
02:44:11,829 --> 02:44:27,940
Cheese is disgusting. Um I mean it's a lot of people can't eat it. If you're lactose intolerant

811
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:33,909
cheese kind of balls up in people. So it does. I don't find that to be Lego. What'd you say? How

812
02:44:33,909 --> 02:44:46,700
could you say that? If you're lactose intolerant you it kills you. It's I mean I love that stuff

813
02:44:50,059 --> 02:45:09,510
but even it's hard to eat that. It's hard to eat cheese in large quantities. False. It's okay well

814
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:15,819
it's not hard to eat cheese in large quantities. It's very easy because it tastes really great

815
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:23,879
and you can sit there and eat it all day. But what I mean is physically after you do that

816
02:45:23,879 --> 02:45:46,659
you might feel quite ill. Barry's back. No can we change that name because it's not backtracking.

817
02:45:46,659 --> 02:46:07,059
Can you call me like Clarification Crisp? That's more accurate. It's backtracking the name. No

818
02:46:07,059 --> 02:46:19,799
that's uh it's just Clarification Crisp. Additional Statement Aaron.

819
02:46:28,969 --> 02:46:32,649
All right I want to get. Do I have gold on both these? I do. Oh shit I do have gold.

820
02:46:33,610 --> 02:46:37,610
No I don't want to do any. I've got gold. I don't want to do them. What's the other one?

821
02:46:44,069 --> 02:47:00,780
Juxtaposition Jill. Correction Kevin. All right I'm gonna do another one.

822
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:22,790
Let's get this one. I guess I look cool doing it. Addendum Andrew. Addendum Andy. Addendum Addendum Andy.

823
02:47:26,969 --> 02:47:47,159
Why does it all. I wanted to turn the other way. Why does it always turn this way?

824
02:47:48,200 --> 02:48:05,379
Maybe it's the other way I'm holding the Wiimote. Hold down drift. Is drift uh

825
02:48:08,979 --> 02:48:14,500
buy a new sword? All right I have a new one right now. I'm not going to buy another one. No I won't

826
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:41,979
be able to have it in the next mission. Simpsons hit and run flashbacks. There we go. Oh no this

827
02:48:41,979 --> 02:48:56,979
is not. Oh this is another free fight. All right I'm trying not to get hit again. They have guns.

828
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:06,149
They have guns. No they don't. It's not guns. I thought it was guns.

829
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:31,139
Oh he almost hit me. Whoa. Whoa. Okay I'm fine. Whoa. No I'm not. He almost hit me. Whoa. Okay.

830
02:49:33,639 --> 02:49:44,729
In the corner. I gotta get in the corner. Please look. Okay get this guy first.

831
02:49:56,649 --> 02:50:03,770
Oh shit. Oh shit. I want to run run run run turn. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I almost got hit.

832
02:50:12,170 --> 02:50:45,350
Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Back it up. Watch it. One more guy right here. Come here. Got

833
02:50:45,350 --> 02:50:55,159
it. That's it right? Any more? Yeah. These missions are the hardest thing in the game.

834
02:50:56,569 --> 02:51:09,590
Yeah they are. They are. Give me the gold. This game is inherently satisfying. Yes it is. All right

835
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:15,610
I got enough money for the entrance for the next fee for the next germa rumble. Two hundred and

836
02:51:15,610 --> 02:51:25,079
twelve thousand dollars. Okay let me go back. Let me go back to the house and save. I have the new

837
02:51:25,079 --> 02:51:29,770
blade on. Yeah I do because I'm using one hand to hold it. The other one was two handed wasn't it?

838
02:51:30,729 --> 02:51:37,430
Travis with the next rumble. I already told you what's gonna happen to smash.

839
02:51:38,069 --> 02:52:13,739
It's fighters past two combatant three. I just stole somebody else's prediction.

840
02:52:18,790 --> 02:52:30,260
What? I'm playing no more heroes today. That's why I'm saying that and then he's a Nintendo

841
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:39,860
character. Well let me have this. Let me have. You can tell them to talk with my hands.

842
02:52:51,909 --> 02:52:59,159
We don't need any more sword characters. Well that just. Oh no I can't say this. Never mind.

843
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:11,850
No. Well then. Well then delete like the 12 fire emblem characters that are the same character.

844
02:53:12,969 --> 02:53:49,219
I tried to stop. I tried to stop myself. Pick me up. Pick me up. Come pick me up. Oh what's that?

845
02:53:50,809 --> 02:54:00,600
Hold on. Oh well I mean here's the thing though. If you're a big fan. If you're a big fan of uh

846
02:54:01,829 --> 02:54:06,469
of fire emblem. I look if you like those characters that's really really good.

847
02:54:07,350 --> 02:54:13,750
I'm happy that you care about that series. I'm just saying that very very clearly if there's

848
02:54:13,750 --> 02:54:19,750
already like 10 12 sword characters in the game. I don't we don't need that many more.

849
02:54:20,549 --> 02:54:23,750
I guess is what I'm trying to say. It's a cool series though.

850
02:54:24,469 --> 02:54:45,450
Fire Emblem is awesome. I played it. It's very very good. Play with the cat. You hungry? We get

851
02:54:45,450 --> 02:54:50,979
to watch the cat eat. You thought there was only one or two cat interactions. It's like 10. There

852
02:54:50,979 --> 02:55:19,610
there. Hungry cat. Moments like these is what makes me know that Travis isn't that bad.

853
02:55:20,569 --> 02:55:38,569
Yeah let's go to the draw. Let's see. Yeah that's the original one. I'm using the new one. It's the

854
02:55:38,569 --> 02:55:53,500
Tsubaki. Yeah I got it on. All right let's go to assassin mission number eight. Travis is a

855
02:55:53,500 --> 02:56:21,450
shithead. Travis is a bad dude. Yeah pretty I mean yeah. Fuckhead. PS3 remake sucks. Well that's

856
02:56:22,090 --> 02:56:29,879
I'm I'm I know that strong opinion. I'm not I'm that's I'm not playing the PS3 one. This is the

857
02:56:32,170 --> 02:56:54,819
Wii version. Wii version of the game. I hope you could hear the air quotes. How do I dig into

858
02:56:54,819 --> 02:57:12,870
concrete? Where is that? What version is the Wii version? My control is rumbling.

859
02:57:27,059 --> 02:57:42,809
He means Wii guys. Yes he means this is what he means. Yes yes yes yes there it is.

860
02:57:43,450 --> 02:57:57,219
He's got to prove he owns the game and the console. He's got to prove he owns the game and the console

861
02:57:57,219 --> 02:58:18,040
in his closet. Play rhythm heaven you coward. That's part of the plan. Yeah the next fight has been

868
02:58:59,239 --> 02:59:07,979
busy shopping right now or busy killing people because that is all you ever do. What am I wrong?

869
02:59:07,979 --> 02:59:35,899
Well I guess not. Omega porn game. It's not a fucking omega porn game. Omega porn game.

870
02:59:35,899 --> 02:59:43,180
Ranking battle eight. No guys an omega porn game is just you going to Pornhub and opening up a tab.

871
02:59:44,139 --> 03:00:14,040
That what are you talking about? That's not a game. Let's play that game.

872
03:00:26,329 --> 03:00:26,969
Relax.

873
03:00:39,799 --> 03:00:40,280
Ranking.

03:01:02,299 --> 03:01:04,700
I'm not gonna know what that is. I don't know what that is. I'm not gonna say the rest of that. I

875
03:01:04,700 --> 03:01:17,379
don't know what the fuck that is. I'm not saying any shit.

876
03:01:17,379 --> 03:01:22,229
Just look at him.

877
03:01:26,329 --> 03:01:51,219
Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill him. Fire axe. Any goodies that I missed?

878
03:02:03,770 --> 03:02:04,489
That's my favorite one.

What the how many combos do I was it five hit or six hit combo now?

880
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:43,399
Date the AI from AI dungeons and get its number.

What are you talking about? I'm on team Travis. Travis.

Based. What was that? Easy. Double. Oh no. Damn it. Damn it. Money.

03:05:08,040 --> 03:05:31,930
Money. Someone just said I love money. Let me see what this does.

888
03:05:31,930 --> 03:05:58,139
It just makes lots of smoke. Do you love money? Money. Oh it extinguishes you if you're on fire.

889
03:05:58,860 --> 03:06:05,860
That's what it does. Of course it does. Hey anybody in chat love money?

890
03:06:16,040 --> 03:06:38,200
Idiot. What's that? I need it. Holy shit. What is this one? This one is all bar bar bar. What

900
03:08:58,940 --> 03:09:05,739
I think it'd be a pretty good uh swing sword voice for a video game. You know what I'm saying?

901

Shoot. Come on. Give me. Please. It's link. No it's not.

Imagine saying that and then getting destroyed. Wait what?

904
03:10:19,379 --> 03:10:27,739
I got that guy like five times. Oh fuck I don't know which way I was going to the hall.

905
03:10:39,959 --> 03:10:43,239
What a pain. You're a joke. What a pain. You're a joke.

906
03:10:49,139 --> 03:11:19,079
Grab. Grab. Grab. Grab him. I left for an hour and a half and he made the same joke from an hour and a

You're a joke. What? I'm just. No I'm repeating the. What are you talking about? I'm

909
03:11:42,569 --> 03:11:46,010
repeating the word that he says when he says you're a joke.

910
03:11:48,659 --> 03:12:03,129
What? Are you prepared? I'm gonna say that a bunch of fucking times guys. I've. Kim told. I've

911
03:12:03,129 --> 03:12:11,750
probably told this story. Kim walked down the stairs one time and I was for three days straight

912
03:12:12,309 --> 03:12:19,319
was repeating the same Thanos lines from Infinity War. She came down while I was going like this

913
03:12:19,319 --> 03:12:24,840
universe is finite. It's resources finite. The will. I just I did his entire monologue

914
03:12:25,559 --> 03:12:35,000

915
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:40,309
what the what are you talking about? I don't even know I'm doing that. It just happens. I just do

916
03:12:40,309 --> 03:12:48,459
that one time. Okay I was taking a shower like three or four weeks ago and I was just talking.

917
03:12:48,459 --> 03:12:53,739
I was just doing like a scene from a movie and I didn't know I didn't think anyone was home.

918
03:12:54,459 --> 03:12:58,739
She just walks in and I and I look at her and like oh hey hey she's like what are you doing?

919
03:12:58,739 --> 03:13:08,149
I'm like I don't know I'm just like talking. That's the last time you showered.

920
03:13:17,979 --> 03:13:30,979
When this stream is over today I'm going to be just hanging out in my room

03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:48,229
Over and over again until I go to sleep. I don't know it's just fun.

923
03:14:13,780 --> 03:14:31,879
Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me. You're annoying me now. Now you're annoying me.

924
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:54,790
All right that was a tricky room. His brain can only hold so much data.

925
03:14:56,549 --> 03:14:59,190
My brain can hold a shitload of data. Thank you very much.

926
03:15:01,110 --> 03:15:07,430
Look one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

928
03:15:35,979 --> 03:16:01,059
Wait for the opportunity. Damn it. Did it hit me?

931
03:16:46,200 --> 03:16:57,479
There it is on his neck.

932
03:17:02,950 --> 03:17:09,909
Go back to Nancy Drew. This clearly isn't your pace and you think Nancy Drew is my pace? I had

933
03:17:09,909 --> 03:17:17,350
to use a walkthrough to complete the puzzles in that game. I'm confused. I have your statement

934
03:17:18,309 --> 03:17:28,579
I had to be on gameboomers.com the whole stream. I knew it. I called you cheater. We already I

935
03:17:28,579 --> 03:17:35,350
already talked we talked about that already. That wasn't a secret. I was only using it when it was

936
03:17:35,350 --> 03:17:48,700
completely necessary. Like anytime a fucking math problem would come on screen. Your next ranked

937
03:17:48,700 --> 03:17:54,139
fight begins the moment you step into that room. Win and you'll rise to ace in rank.

938
03:18:00,780 --> 03:18:09,530
Hit the can. Pick the tartar of your teeth. When you're ready step inside. Tartar tartar sauce.

939
03:18:10,170 --> 03:18:14,090
Fried fish. Fried fish sandwich. There's only one way to find out. I'll be back tomorrow.

940
03:18:14,090 --> 03:18:20,059
I want to go I'll make a fried fish sandwich. I am uncertain you're returning from this battle

941
03:18:20,059 --> 03:18:28,229
Travis. In a body bag. The garden of madness. Oh come on you don't give me give me a break.

942
03:18:29,190 --> 03:18:35,770
You can't give me a break. Come on really. Come on give me a break. Give me a break. Give me a

943
03:18:35,770 --> 03:18:51,290
break. Your ADHD is an overdrive. Sometimes it does feel like that though. Remember the Bing

944
03:18:51,290 --> 03:18:57,719
commercial? Where it was like fried fish. Fried fish $2.99. Fried fish $2.99. $200. The people

945
03:18:57,719 --> 03:19:08,010
all yelling at each other in grocery store and stuff. Somebody would say something and somebody

946
03:19:08,010 --> 03:19:11,690
would say something after that that was connected to that word. You guys don't remember this

947
03:19:11,690 --> 03:19:23,079
commercial? Yeah search overload. That's that was a not even that long ago. That was like

948
03:19:23,079 --> 03:19:28,360
five years ago. Travis now you're getting back into the groove. Remember the 18th suplex of your

949
03:19:28,360 --> 03:19:35,979
master. The trust building exercise gone wrong. Captured. You remembered an old professional

950
03:19:35,979 --> 03:20:06,540
wrestling move. Search overload. It was 12 years ago. Those commercials were funny.

951
03:20:10,950 --> 03:20:13,829
I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you with the reuse joke thing.

952
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:43,100
Um rank eight. Here we go. A rankings fight? Yeah how about it? All right will you give me a minute?

953
03:20:49,209 --> 03:21:09,700
Wait for me in the hallway. Right. Mind if we do this somewhere else? You're the boss.

954
03:21:10,579 --> 03:21:21,270
Stop checking me out like that. You killed them? Such a gentleman. Are you asking out of

955
03:21:21,270 --> 03:21:28,149
tactical curiosity or are you just fucking with me? Bet they didn't offer much resistance.

956
03:21:29,030 --> 03:21:36,569
You got a problem with that? You got no idea how hard it is to hide your true self around here.

957
03:21:36,569 --> 03:21:47,239
Hey I'm not accusing anybody. How? Real gentlemen. I just turned my back but you didn't strike.

958
03:21:48,040 --> 03:21:53,559
You are fucking with me. It's actually pretty hard to take cheap shots when your enemy is as

959
03:21:53,559 --> 03:22:00,520
bloodthirsty as yourself. People like us think alike. Don't. Is there a cabin over here? Shall

960
03:22:00,520 --> 03:22:13,610
we? Does it need to be explained? Go. You will pay with your life. Have my chance. I will now

961
03:22:13,610 --> 03:22:19,100
avenge my father. Something tells me you watch too many samurai movies little girl.

962
03:22:19,100 --> 03:22:31,370
What the hell was that?

963
03:22:34,139 --> 03:22:42,870
Robert Atkinson really does add so much to this character. Seriously. That like. Only he could do

964
03:22:42,870 --> 03:23:19,020
that. Easy. Low. I think she's going low mostly. Yep. Oh that hurts. What's with my stamina? My

965
03:23:19,739 --> 03:23:45,479
beam stamina? Get it. Whoa. It's low. This song's really good. It is pretty good.

966
03:23:53,799 --> 03:24:03,909
Got it. No mercy. No mercy. No mercy. No mercy. Ow. All right. Don't fuck around.

967
03:24:16,379 --> 03:24:40,469
Do we move? What? I didn't catch you in a combo? What? Watch that battery power. Oh fuck. That hurt.

968
03:24:50,870 --> 03:24:55,500
Ooh. Did I get it? All right. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I need to charge.

969
03:25:02,139 --> 03:25:52,420
Oh shit. Not good. What the hell? Fucking battery. Why? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Don't do it.

970
03:25:53,139 --> 03:26:00,549
Don't do it. Oh fuck. What you doing? Oh no, no, no, no, no. Don't kill me. Please don't kill me.

971
03:26:01,270 --> 03:26:26,440
Is that a kill? Is that an instant kill? Where am I? Oh this health. Oh shit. My fucking pants.

972
03:26:28,600 --> 03:26:41,639
Oh shit. I tried to dodge it. I'm dead. I'm dead. Fuck. I tried. I dodged it. You got.

973
03:26:42,200 --> 03:27:00,790
Shit. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. This health right over here.

974
03:27:00,790 --> 03:27:06,950
Fuck this. Fuck that. You actually just hit me. How dare you?

975
03:27:26,860 --> 03:28:31,260
Bastard. Easy. Slow down. Battery. Still good on health. Shit. Sonic Sword is the best

976
03:28:31,260 --> 03:29:05,510
option if you go in. Oh shit. My pants. I'm good. Battery. Get it out of the way. Oh shit.

977
03:29:06,069 --> 03:30:00,469
Don't blow it like last time. Dead. Why is she invincible? My hair.

978
03:30:26,309 --> 03:30:38,100
Jacob's was my mentor. I'd never kill him. I watched Master Jacob's teachings on video

979
03:30:38,100 --> 03:30:45,459
over and over. Video. We never met in person. I watched him over and over again. I admit it.

980
03:30:45,459 --> 03:30:54,389
I lost. Do it. How about kill yourself after you kill me? Sounds like a bit straight out of a

981
03:30:54,389 --> 03:31:00,549
samurai movie. Don't it? Shut up. Shut up and kill me already. You've already dishonored me enough.

982
03:31:01,350 --> 03:31:08,149
Do it yourself. I watched Master Jerma on stream over and over. What would you learn? I'll fight

983
03:31:08,149 --> 03:31:15,430
you anytime, anywhere. How to wicked easily get headaches. How to sneeze and like get a hernia.

984
03:31:16,620 --> 03:31:34,899
Which one? That's A. Clear time. A. How to slap yourself. How to put together masterful comedy.

985
03:31:35,540 --> 03:31:55,670
I see what you're saying now. Thanks. Appreciate that. HP upgrade. How to backtrack. Not yet. What

986
03:31:55,670 --> 03:32:16,229
else is in here? I can't talk. I think we just leave. Jerma, you must go forward.

987
03:32:16,950 --> 03:32:27,370
Which Dark Souls did I beat on stream again? Multiple. More than one.

988
03:32:39,930 --> 03:32:46,409
Then let her live. Wait, this was that guy? Welcome to the channel.

989
03:32:52,889 --> 03:32:58,889
Kill when you can kill. That's bullshit. All I want to do is fight someone better than me.

990
03:32:59,850 --> 03:33:02,809
She'll grow up. Why not kill her when she's stronger?

991
03:33:03,770 --> 03:33:39,049
Yeah, then I'll kill her. You are sick. So are you. Oh damn. Got him for eight. Shinobu. Not anymore.

992
03:33:39,850 --> 03:34:00,579
Moving up. It's gonna be hard missing her arm. Yeah, but we'll just get a robot one. We've

993
03:34:00,579 --> 03:34:21,059
trained with the other hand. Why is there an ad for the game in the game? Uh, is there an ad?

994
03:34:21,540 --> 03:34:26,180
Beathead videos. Just calling to let you know that one of the videos returned yesterday

995
03:34:26,180 --> 03:34:32,180
wasn't one of ours. It doesn't have a label on it, but it seems to be a recording of a guy

996
03:34:32,979 --> 03:34:40,040
pumping a pillow. The video you should have returned was, um, how to please a woman in bed

997
03:34:40,040 --> 03:34:48,579
101 part two. Please return it to us soon. Thank you. Jesus Christ. Congratulations, Mr. Touchdown.

998
03:34:49,139 --> 03:34:54,979
Your registration for the eighth UAA rank is now complete. In addition, we have faxed you

999
03:34:54,979 --> 03:35:00,739
some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your ascent. Please transfer

1000
03:35:00,739 --> 03:35:08,059
the money into the designated account. Have a nice day. About 300 grand? 500 grand? It's probably

1001
03:35:08,059 --> 03:35:16,069
three. 250? I'm gonna say 250. 250. Entry fee for your next rank fight is $250,000.

1002
03:35:16,629 --> 03:35:29,750
All right. Just lounge it. Every time we come back, we have to play with the cap. The phone

1003
03:35:29,750 --> 03:35:54,739
recording guy is, uh, Ryden's VA from Metal Gear Solid 2. Pretty cool. And for, and rising. Yeah.

1004
03:35:55,540 --> 03:36:07,379
Pretty cool. Gold Town is now open. Beefhead is now open. New part-time job is available.

1005
03:36:08,340 --> 03:36:20,120
Is there any, uh, is there a new sword available? Let's check. Let's check Beef Town. Excuse me.

1006
03:36:20,440 --> 03:36:32,780
Excuse me. Am I going to finish this game tonight? Uh, probably not. No, no way.

1007
03:36:33,420 --> 03:36:41,860
We'll do, we'll, we'll, we'll, I would assume we'll get it probably exactly. It's like a 12 hour

1008
03:36:41,860 --> 03:36:50,440
game, right? It's like 10 to 13, 10 to 14 hours, something like that. Probably do it over two

1009
03:36:50,440 --> 03:37:00,649
screens. Hey, how's biz? By the way, that thing you wanted hasn't come in yet. So what will it be

1010
03:37:00,649 --> 03:37:17,510
today? Video volume one. The title is Masked Panther. Tiger's Roar. Did I get it? That's

1011
03:37:17,510 --> 03:37:23,209
chilling, Travis. You've got the eye, man. The eye for cool. All right, let's get it. Let's go

1012
03:37:23,209 --> 03:37:36,500
watch it too. Don't die out there. Oh, for wrestling moves here. That makes sense. All right. We also

1013
03:37:36,500 --> 03:37:44,040
have to go to somewhere over here. I want to check the Katana place. Let's see if there's any new

1014
03:37:44,040 --> 03:37:54,090
stuff. Is this going to be a 100% gameplay type deal or are you just going to beat it?

1015
03:37:55,290 --> 03:38:04,340
Um, I don't, I wouldn't say a hundred percent, but I'm going to play it until I don't care. I mean,

1016
03:38:04,340 --> 03:38:12,459
I want to play. Ooh, there it is. T-shirt enough until I'm done. Cause I do want to play the second

1017
03:38:12,459 --> 03:38:28,600
one too. Probably not a hundred percent. A single finger on anything. Don't lay a finger on anything.

1018
03:38:28,600 --> 03:38:33,799
I'll kill you. All right. You got anything new? You do not have anything new, any new parts. You

1019
03:38:33,799 --> 03:38:49,670
do have new parts. Power up parts for Tsubaki exchanges the crystal parts inside the beam Katana

1020
03:38:49,670 --> 03:39:09,719
with pure crystals to greatly increase its output. Energy saving part. So this is for longer battery

1021
03:39:09,719 --> 03:39:17,670
life. Adds a, I thought that said motherfucker adds a motherfucker to the beam Katana increases

1022
03:39:17,670 --> 03:39:26,229
in it. I'll get this one. This is the power one. Let's go extraordinary power. I don't have enough

1023
03:39:26,229 --> 03:39:42,920
for the other one. Adds a fuck head to the Katana. I don't have enough money to get it. We have to

1024
03:39:42,920 --> 03:39:54,860
do more jobs. Can we get a little wink? I think I see 1200 points, not 75,000. Yes, you do. I

1025
03:39:54,860 --> 03:40:00,649
don't know. I don't want it. No, I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it. Wait, what?

1026
03:40:00,649 --> 03:40:18,979
You have 125,000. I need money. Wait, how much money do I have? Oh fuck. Okay. I don't know why

1027
03:40:18,979 --> 03:40:27,909
I thought that was 12,000, not 125. You did 75,000 points. Don't fuck yourself for raising the bit

1028
03:40:27,909 --> 03:40:43,139
amount for highlighted messages. You asshole. Well, you don't want to see a sea of purple

1029
03:40:43,139 --> 03:40:56,420
highlighted messages in chat wall stream. Well, you do. Yeah. Essentially before it was this chat

1030
03:40:56,420 --> 03:41:02,899
was just purple text. That's what it was. See now it's intended purpose of, and here we go.

1031
03:41:02,899 --> 03:41:11,350
Here we go. Open up the slot gates. Let's go. Imagine not having enough channel points.

1032
03:41:16,219 --> 03:41:23,979
Well, hold on a minute here. I, I, I decreased, I increased the one for highlighting a chat message,

1033
03:41:23,979 --> 03:41:32,280
but I decreased the unlock what the, uh, changing an emote that used to be 1250. That's now 750.

1034
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:42,389
Just save for the wing. I told you that there's a huge play here where if you guys just don't spend

1035
03:41:42,389 --> 03:41:49,940
your channel points in like two years, you can all spend them to get me to wink and it'll ruin an

1036
03:41:49,940 --> 03:41:58,340
entire stream that will, it'll ruin everything. You will, you're guaranteed to fuck up at least

1037
03:41:58,340 --> 03:42:16,120
one full entire live stream like in six months. What do you want? What do you want? Make it in

1038
03:42:16,120 --> 03:42:24,200
the hundreds. I'm not going to go home to mommy. Leave me alone. I want to enjoy this moment.

1039
03:42:24,760 --> 03:42:32,040
I already got six K. You got six K. Find the seven Lovikov balls scattered across Santa

1040
03:42:32,040 --> 03:42:53,659
destroy and bring them to this drunk. How many points for a date? Uh, 500 million channel points,

1041
03:42:55,979 --> 03:42:59,659
which would take probably 10 years of me streaming. So I don't think you'll ever get

1042
03:43:00,540 --> 03:43:22,219
training. Here we go. Bench press, increasing your strength. Let's go. Tapping, tapping, tapping,

1043
03:43:22,219 --> 03:43:28,899
tapping. Just pull your points. No, it has to be from one single account.

1044
03:43:37,979 --> 03:43:44,680
I can't just pull all your points. How much to have a chat message go through text to speech?

1045
03:43:45,879 --> 03:43:49,399
Well, that would mean that I would have to have text to speech turned on in the stream and there

1046
03:43:49,399 --> 03:44:10,409
is, that is never going to happen. Why? Uh, because I don't like it. I don't like it. We've talked

1047
03:44:10,409 --> 03:44:14,090
about this already. There's somebody just talking while you're talking at the same time.

1048
03:44:16,309 --> 03:44:20,469
Somebody could just be talking over me talking, telling two completely different things at the

1049
03:44:20,469 --> 03:44:37,819
same time. You already, you already randomly just picked stuff from chats or read. Anyways,

1050
03:44:37,819 --> 03:44:57,770
it's pretty much text to speech already, except it's text to Jeremy. And there's another reason

1051
03:44:57,770 --> 03:45:03,370
why I don't like text to speech because not just for the stream, but a majority of these streams

1052
03:45:03,370 --> 03:45:11,959
are cut down and put on YouTube. And it's watching a video where there's just a TTS,

1053
03:45:11,959 --> 03:45:37,479
just talking on an edited video. It just, it's, it's messy. It's messy. Now he cares about YouTube.

1054
03:45:40,069 --> 03:45:46,069
I mean, I care, I care about the channel being like a watchable channel for people that don't

1055
03:45:46,069 --> 03:45:56,459
want to watch streams. Yes, of course I do. Yes, I do. The intended purpose of that channel is to

1056
03:45:56,459 --> 03:46:02,219
make it so people that don't have time or don't want to catch a stream, they, you know, I've got,

1057
03:46:02,219 --> 03:46:07,659
I only got maybe 15, 10, 20 minutes of time and, oh, but I did want to see some highlights from

1058
03:46:07,659 --> 03:46:14,489
that. There you go. That's, that's for you. There's VODs on Twitch. Yeah. For 60 days.

1059
03:46:15,209 --> 03:46:19,530
And then they get cut down. If you don't got time to sit through a six, seven plus hour stream,

1060
03:46:19,530 --> 03:46:30,440
you know, Barry, get the fuck out of here. All right. How did I get bronze on this one? Disgusting.

1061
03:46:31,079 --> 03:46:55,020
I actually watched the YouTube highlights, even if I watched the stream.

1062
03:46:57,479 --> 03:47:01,719
It's, it's for anybody that wants to, if you wanted to catch up on something, if,

1063
03:47:02,520 --> 03:47:07,159
you know, let's say you wanted to watch the last few streams, but by the last, you know, let's say,

1064
03:47:07,159 --> 03:47:10,920
oh yeah, I heard about that Simpsons hit and run stream where didn't he like fucking bite his

1065
03:47:10,920 --> 03:47:21,479
controller? Oh, wait, it's a 13 hour VOD. I, I don't really want to do that. I got like 10 minutes

1066
03:47:21,479 --> 03:47:44,629
today though. Went the wrong way. Shit. Make channel point 100 K for Nancy Drew again.

1067
03:47:46,840 --> 03:47:52,440
No, I can't start doing that. Cause that if you, if it's like, oh, for a hundred, I'll play like

1068
03:47:52,440 --> 03:47:56,520
league of legends at a hundred thousand channel points. I don't want to, I don't want to do that.

1069
03:48:00,219 --> 03:48:04,219
Nancy Drew is fine, but that's, you open up the, you open up the can of worms there.

1070
03:48:04,299 --> 03:48:19,860
No wrestling moves. They take too much time. Fuck. Oh, I'm sorry. Do it. Don't kill the CEO.

1071
03:48:20,659 --> 03:48:30,600
That's a, that's a gold right there. 100 K points. You have to be jumping DLC bronze.

1072
03:48:31,479 --> 03:49:12,709
All right. That's surprising. I thought I did. I had like 20, 15 seconds to spare any jobs.

1073
03:49:12,790 --> 03:49:28,360
Speed. Just nuke the boss. Third class. Not bad. The first rated God will give you a smile. Yeah.

1074
03:49:28,360 --> 03:49:40,790
Yeah. Yeah. Garbage collection. Cleanup Santa destroy, pick up as much garbage as you can within

1075
03:49:40,790 --> 03:49:54,920
the time limit. $1,000 for a bunch of garbage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1076
03:49:57,739 --> 03:50:02,780
Garbage collection. Clean up Santa destroy, pick up as much garbage as you can within the time limit.

1077
03:50:03,739 --> 03:50:05,750
$1,000 for each piece of garbage.

1078
03:50:10,059 --> 03:50:31,129
Garbage is the easiest one. I do remember this one being okay. Has redeemed 1 million points

1079
03:50:31,129 --> 03:50:49,209
for Lord of the Rings stream. Dude. Pog. Lord of the, really? That's a Pog champ right there.

1080
03:50:49,209 --> 03:50:55,239
I've never seen that. Naked Lord of the Rings stream. No, that would have to be a million

1081
03:50:55,239 --> 03:51:00,840
dollars. And then I, no, I'm not, no, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't stream naked for a million dollars.

1082
03:51:01,079 --> 03:51:17,129
What am I saying that for? I wouldn't do that. Unless, what? He put out a price.

1083
03:51:24,040 --> 03:51:27,479
Freedom and anarchy. There's nothing much here, really. Just remnants, cast offs,

1084
03:51:27,479 --> 03:51:32,920
ruins. The garbage that litters our streets. Mark the remnants of lives. You following me?

1085
03:51:32,920 --> 03:51:38,120
Each piece of garbage is a lost soul. So what better way to spend your life saving lost souls?

1086
03:51:38,120 --> 03:51:43,239
A true garbage man can bring peace to the dead. It's taken me 12 years to realize this truth.

1087
03:51:44,040 --> 03:51:49,239
You've got potential. A soul that can talk with garbage. The God of Garbage would watch

1088
03:51:49,239 --> 03:51:54,200
you and go save that garbage. No bikes that pollute the air are allowed in this environmentally

1089
03:51:54,200 --> 03:52:13,370
friendly mission. Pick up garbage. Get all the soda cans. Oh, this, I love this song. This is a

1090
03:52:13,370 --> 03:53:01,290
good song. Here I come. And easy. Shit. Now pick it up. That's a huge can. It was like 80 ounces.

1091
03:53:11,739 --> 03:53:20,309
Easy. Is it a thousand dollars per one? Yeah, this is like probably 50 grand. This is probably the

1092
03:53:20,309 --> 03:53:40,649
best pound for pound for money. Save your winks for April 1st. Maybe you'll get it. April 1st

1093
03:53:40,649 --> 03:53:52,729
is gonna be a wink stream. Terrible stream that's gonna be. Remind me to on like April 1st or March

1094
03:53:52,729 --> 03:53:58,729
30th or something to make sure the thing that I was planning on doing on April 1st or April 2nd

1095
03:53:58,729 --> 03:54:06,469
or whatever is something that does not require any fucking brain power. Any. I'm gonna have to

1096
03:54:06,469 --> 03:54:21,639
turn my cam on and wink like every five seconds. We want to damage your eyes. And I'm the serial

1097
03:54:21,639 --> 03:54:50,969
killer. Me. This guy. I'm the serial killer. It's 40 grand so far. 50 grand. Let's get it. 44. 45.

1098
03:54:54,969 --> 03:55:03,260
46. Gotta be an even number. Come on. Even number. Get an even number. Please. Jesus, Jeremy. Fucking

1099
03:55:03,260 --> 03:55:25,579

1100
03:55:25,579 --> 03:55:41,750
third raider. I got another job. Something shady. What is it? A brand new free fight mission can

1101
03:55:41,750 --> 03:55:55,620
now be selected. Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. Can you sing at my nephew's birthday party? No.

1102
03:55:57,500 --> 03:56:04,600
$50,000. Pizza butt returns. Chain restaurant pizza butt plans to open up. To crush their

1103
03:56:04,680 --> 03:56:07,879
plans to kill pizza butt CEO. 50 grand. Let's go.

1104
03:56:17,959 --> 03:56:31,219
What? What's wrong with that? Sing at my wedding. I'll give you $2,000.

1105
03:56:39,430 --> 03:56:48,889
May you find your true path. I think this is what it is. How many points for you to

1106
03:56:49,930 --> 03:56:57,690
like nephews? He didn't even respond. What do you want me to say? Oh yeah. When's your

1107
03:56:57,690 --> 03:57:15,379
wedding? Oh me there at six o'clock. I don't know what's going on. What song am I singing?

1108
03:57:15,940 --> 03:57:29,430
Why didn't you invite me to Christmas? Why didn't you invite me to Christmas?

1109
03:57:30,069 --> 03:57:35,930
Why do I have to invite you? Why didn't you invite me? I'm going right to the CEO as fast as I can.

1110
03:57:54,579 --> 03:57:57,299
That's pretty damn fast. That was like five seconds. Six seconds.

1111
03:58:13,829 --> 03:58:24,100
Just do this one over and over again. It's $50,000 every time. Do I have enough? Almost.

1112
03:58:26,780 --> 03:58:38,920
Let me try one of the other free kill ones. Farm pizza butt. Let me try to not get hit.

1113
03:58:39,559 --> 03:59:02,680
See if I can go three for three. Don't get hit. We got people to throw stuff.

1114
03:59:10,700 --> 03:59:31,430
Double. All right. Kill, kill, kill, kill it, kill it. Almost got hit. All right. Get in the corner.

1115
03:59:32,069 --> 03:59:36,940
Who's running? Anybody running over here? Nope. Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1116
03:59:39,180 --> 04:00:12,340
He's behind me. He's behind me. He's behind me. He's not behind me. One minute, 60 seconds.

1117
04:00:12,500 --> 04:00:40,790
If I kill you first. Actually sucked. Oh, this actually sucks. Back up, back up, back up.

1118
04:00:40,790 --> 04:00:57,979
Just blocking everything I'm doing. Got it. There is no such thing as bronze on these. You just do

1119
04:00:57,979 --> 04:01:08,489
it or you don't. $40,000. Why didn't you set my Christmas tree on fire? That was mean. My mom's

1120
04:01:08,489 --> 04:01:27,100
still crying. Why did I or why didn't I? Why didn't you set my Christmas tree on fire? Don't read this.

1121
04:01:27,100 --> 04:01:35,620
Well, it's using channel points, so I'm going to see it. All right. I'm going to buy the...

1122
04:01:37,139 --> 04:01:51,180
I've done all the other upgrades, right? Yeah, I did. I could buy like a new jacket. No, I want

1123
04:01:51,180 --> 04:02:11,989
that. No, I want that yellow jacket. Or that black one. Don't read this. You're going to get a new

1124
04:02:11,989 --> 04:02:29,110
inventory. Jackets. The yellow one. Which one? Black, tan, or that's just another kind of red.

1125
04:02:29,909 --> 04:02:48,549
Let's go black. What's this t-shirt? I want this one. Wait, there's more t-shirts. Oh, yeah.

1126
04:02:53,340 --> 04:03:12,840
What the hell was that? Okay. No, I want this one. I want this one. Jeans. Yeah. New belts.

1127
04:03:15,530 --> 04:03:23,270
No, keep this one. Who wants shoes? The anime ones are the expensive ones.

1128
04:03:24,790 --> 04:03:32,600
I didn't see the back of the jacket. I don't like it. I thought it was just black.

1129
04:03:34,280 --> 04:03:48,170
There's a big skull on it. I need to do another job. Let me do another one of the

1130
04:03:48,170 --> 04:03:56,250
don't get hit ones. That's enough money. Sunglasses? Not yet. That's like 30,000.

1131
04:04:18,579 --> 04:04:29,079
Let's do this one. Oh, I already did that one. Wait, is this a different one?

1132
04:04:31,290 --> 04:04:41,500
Don't these disappear from the map when you do them? What happened to Viscera cleanup detail?

1133
04:04:41,500 --> 04:04:54,440
Well, Joel. Were we supposed to do that? I thought we were going to keep talking and nobody explodes.

1134
04:04:55,159 --> 04:05:39,719
Don't get hit. No. Almost got hit. Almost got hit. All right. Sideway. Sideway. Side. Side. Side. Side.

1135
04:05:39,719 --> 04:05:55,340
Yes. No. What? I thought it was dead. I thought this guy was dead. I thought that guy was just

1136
04:05:55,340 --> 04:06:12,059
dead. What happened? What? Oh, come on. And I can't do it anymore. Fuck. I was waiting for a spawn.

1137
04:06:12,059 --> 04:06:16,219
I look over there. The guy's like a sliver of health left. And he just hit me just in the chest

1138
04:06:16,219 --> 04:06:33,190
or the whatever. It's only one more wave after that too. You can't win them all.

1139
04:06:33,190 --> 04:06:45,559
Quitter? It's not even on the mini-map anymore. I failed it. We should be able

1140
04:06:45,559 --> 04:06:49,940
to redeem a million channel points to have him delete his channel. No,

1141
04:06:49,940 --> 04:06:54,180
a million channel points would be like you get to stream. You get to stream on Jerma's account

1142
04:06:54,180 --> 04:07:38,200
for five minutes. Oh fuck. He's going to hit me from behind. Good. Turn. Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!

1143
04:07:39,319 --> 04:07:51,780
Now I'm in trouble.

1144
04:07:51,819 --> 04:07:53,579
Wow.

1145
04:07:55,100 --> 04:07:57,819
Fuck I knew it. I had the wrestling move fucked it up

1146
04:07:58,340 --> 04:08:07,280
It's okay. That's I knew it was gonna happen wrestling move fucked it up and I lost it. It's fine. Let's do a jump

1147
04:08:07,799 --> 04:08:11,379
Does your mom know that you hate Joel?

1148
04:08:11,899 --> 04:08:27,500
why show

1149
04:08:27,940 --> 04:08:32,590
God damn it. I have to do after like mola lawn. Okay, I'm picking up trash and then I'm like, that's it

1150
04:08:45,530 --> 04:08:48,020
He didn't jump in time. Oh

1151
04:08:49,649 --> 04:08:51,649
Yeah, geez

1152
04:08:52,049 --> 04:08:57,149
Dermot spray them with water. It's chat spray chat with water

1153
04:08:57,930 --> 04:09:04,079
Wait, hold on. I can do this one. All right, let's go. Come on. Don't get fucking hit

1154
04:09:04,079 --> 04:09:08,159
I almost I did like three in a row. I'm gonna get hit three times in a row now

1155
04:09:08,680 --> 04:09:14,250
Dermot, if you're reading this copy Cheeto chicken

1156
04:09:14,690 --> 04:09:42,430
You got it. You blocked every one of my moves. I went up. I went down. I went down down. I went up

1157
04:09:42,430 --> 04:09:44,629
I went down. I went up up up down and he blocked them all

1158
04:09:45,350 --> 04:09:52,059
Dude, you fucking suck, bro

1159
04:09:52,420 --> 04:09:53,620
Oh

1160
04:09:53,620 --> 04:09:54,819
Yeah

1161
04:09:54,819 --> 04:09:58,680
Ross, dude. Hey, I think you can't do shit

1162
04:10:01,760 --> 04:10:07,700
Let's pick up garbage

1163
04:10:09,020 --> 04:10:11,780
Any plans for another emote contest not anytime immediately

1164
04:10:12,180 --> 04:10:20,750
Hi pasta and the Tupperware on the bottom shelf on the fridge when you're done streaming. Love you

04:10:45,190 --> 04:10:55,739
Really and the scream not yet

1169
04:10:56,420 --> 04:11:01,549
No, not yet. That's head. I'm still playing no more heroes

1170
04:11:02,129 --> 04:11:16,090
Trash time. I'm like eight feet tall. Why am I so tall right now?

1171
04:11:21,340 --> 04:11:22,579
Ledge

1172
04:11:22,579 --> 04:11:26,239
shitty route

1173
04:11:26,239 --> 04:11:28,639
Actually really really bad route. I gotta get 50

1174
04:11:29,280 --> 04:11:31,379
I'm gonna focus here

1175
04:11:31,379 --> 04:11:36,350
terrible route

1176
04:11:36,350 --> 04:11:38,530
This is not how you get 50

1177
04:11:39,629 --> 04:11:52,069
What an awful fucking job. I'm embarrassed

1178
04:11:52,670 --> 04:11:54,670
I'm actually embarrassed right now

1179
04:11:54,870 --> 04:11:57,250
My face is like slowly starting to turn red

1180
04:11:58,350 --> 04:12:05,180
And my speech is starting a little different. You know, I mean like you never see god damn it. Oh

1181
04:12:11,819 --> 04:12:33,219
Why did I just hit the edge in operation what the fuck was that don't read whatever he's an electric fence I

1182
04:12:41,959 --> 04:12:43,959
Wonder what the speedrunners of this game do

1183
04:12:44,909 --> 04:12:51,229
Do you just rush to garbage and then you collect garbage like 50 times is the best possible route and then just blow through the rest

1184
04:12:51,229 --> 04:12:52,469
of the game

1185
04:12:52,469 --> 04:12:59,729
Which speed run it has to be a speeder. This is this against popular

1186
04:13:00,329 --> 04:13:04,430
This is a fairly. I mean, it's not insanely popular, but it's popular enough

1187
04:13:05,290 --> 04:13:25,520
It's probably a glitch. Yeah, I've seen roblox roblox games look better than this

1188
04:13:26,159 --> 04:13:30,899
That's just it's just

1189
04:13:31,420 --> 04:13:33,100
objectively incorrect

1190
04:13:33,100 --> 04:13:43,850
Are you you know, are you actually gonna be like talk about no more heroes like that

1191
04:13:44,690 --> 04:14:05,260
Go what I get last time 46

1192
04:14:06,389 --> 04:14:24,260
47

1193
04:14:24,260 --> 04:14:28,139
I got it. Thank God good account at the buzzer

1194
04:14:30,850 --> 04:14:38,899
29 the world record is an hour and 30 minutes or so. That's crazy

1195
04:14:39,420 --> 04:14:52,590
All right, let's pay that fee move on to assassin number seven

1196
04:14:53,270 --> 04:15:24,110
Yeah, let it die is bad. I streamed let it die

1197
04:15:24,829 --> 04:15:40,950
The first six but probably like the first four hours of let it die was fun sort of and then it just kind of

1198
04:15:41,750 --> 04:15:44,030
It was not I didn't didn't keep me

1199
04:15:44,909 --> 04:15:59,069
Didn't keep me at all. I just walk across the goddamn street. It's right here

1200
04:15:59,629 --> 04:16:06,860
They really need to let it die

1201
04:16:06,979 --> 04:16:17,219
It was good for 30 levels and then it got really into free to play mobile game territory. Yeah, that's what I heard

1202
04:16:18,219 --> 04:16:52,850
What happened? Did you respawn as an ant? Oh wait, that was like three hours ago

1203
04:16:53,569 --> 04:16:58,670
But you guys probably weren't here. No, never mind. Yeah, that's what people have over here of like three hours

1204
04:16:59,170 --> 04:17:36,389
Why is cat made out of metal? This is a squeaky cat. We need to put some oil around the the hinges there

1205
04:17:39,680 --> 04:17:44,420
Doesn't sound very good

1206
04:17:45,100 --> 04:17:49,319
Frosty cat

1207
04:17:50,680 --> 04:18:00,340
All right, let's watch that video the tape yeah, I know I know I know I know I know that's a huge changer paper

1208
04:18:00,340 --> 04:18:02,340

1235
04:23:29,000 --> 04:23:31,620

One of the reasons why I wanted to play these on stream

1247
04:26:01,370 --> 04:26:03,370
was because of

1248
04:26:03,889 --> 04:26:08,729

ranking side job config data exit

1274
04:29:21,879 --> 04:29:32,180
Data now data is safe

1275
04:29:33,540 --> 04:29:37,260
There's a move list. It's called Google

1276
04:29:37,500 --> 04:29:40,979
Yeah, but if it was in the game, it'd be easy for me to just grab

1277
04:29:41,500 --> 04:29:49,510
You know what I mean burn because it random each time it might be

1278
04:29:53,379 --> 04:29:58,750
Chest always check the edges

1279
04:30:13,739 --> 04:30:16,040

Hey you I'll kick you in the nuts, it's so stupid

And they speak so quickly too. It's like hey you I'll kick you in the nuts

1297
04:34:46,459 --> 04:34:48,459
It's almost like it's sped ups

1298
04:35:10,080 --> 04:35:28,880
Get up, oh I had to finish that

1299
04:35:44,369 --> 04:35:48,919

04:35:51,319 --> 04:36:09,470
Oh, they've really fixed means

1301
04:36:10,869 --> 04:36:14,709
To the mini bosses and glad they got nerfed in the sequel

1302
04:36:15,430 --> 04:36:18,490
They're quite tricky. There's somebody alive

1303
04:36:30,159 --> 04:36:32,159
Be careful. Oh

1304
04:36:33,569 --> 04:36:35,569
Okay, I blocked it but it knocked me down

1305
04:36:38,220 --> 04:36:40,220
Jesus that's fast. All right

1306
04:36:41,020 --> 04:37:03,659
Get him easy

1307
04:37:03,700 --> 04:37:11,250
No, don't get cocky. I don't lose here

1308
04:37:15,389 --> 04:37:17,590
Stop you fucker

1309
04:37:41,799 --> 04:37:52,279
Hello

1310
04:37:57,040 --> 04:38:00,360
That's a stupid trash talk that's

1311
04:38:02,439 --> 04:38:04,860
We're about to get a fight you and me

1312
04:38:05,639 --> 04:38:10,159
One on one here. Yeah, let's go. Let's go get your hands up. I'm gonna kick you in the nuts

1313
04:38:11,880 --> 04:38:13,880
Fuck you, dude

1314
04:38:32,159 --> 04:38:37,880
The mind games he never actually does that yeah

1315
04:38:52,040 --> 04:38:58,189
Of course, I'm gonna read it

1316
04:38:58,990 --> 04:39:01,029
What are you doing? I'm gonna read that

1317
04:39:01,750 --> 04:39:09,509
People that think oh deep to the this stream. It doesn't read chat. I've read almost everything almost maybe like 40% of everything

1318
04:39:10,110 --> 04:39:26,479
Close enough new move Travis. Remember now the most fundamental among fundamental suplexes made famous in Calgary

1319
04:39:26,880 --> 04:39:30,799
It's the all-natural amusement machine the German suplex. I don't know

1320
04:39:31,919 --> 04:39:58,060
Don't I already know how to do it. I've done that a few times. That's the dragon suplex

1321
04:39:59,159 --> 04:40:18,790
German suplex is just around the waist right and backwards. It's not even full health

1322
04:40:20,240 --> 04:40:23,159
Like edit for a cutscene cuz that would suck if I don't

1323
04:40:23,919 --> 04:40:32,930
right

1324
04:40:32,930 --> 04:40:35,110
destroy my

1325
04:40:35,869 --> 04:40:45,240
Thought I wouldn't make it here on time had to take care of some customers that filed complaints my apologies

1326
04:40:45,840 --> 04:40:52,799
So much to do with so little help. Yeah, I can't stand these people with all their nonsense complaints

1327
04:40:52,799 --> 04:41:00,360
I think they can just say anything. It's crazy. But anyway, I'm here. I made it on time. That's the important thing, right? I

1328
04:41:01,200 --> 04:41:03,200
Take it. You're mr. 8

1329
04:41:03,319 --> 04:41:06,279
You you're ranked not me

1330
04:41:06,919 --> 04:41:13,319
Well, actually it is me. I remember this guy that that's great. Never mind then you've got a job to do

1331
04:41:13,599 --> 04:41:19,119
But first I need some time to get ready. Would you mind turning the other way? I need some privacy privacy

1332
04:41:19,639 --> 04:41:21,639
Yes, I need to prepare

1333
04:41:22,240 --> 04:41:23,439
whatever

1334
04:41:23,439 --> 04:41:29,720
Don't mind me pretend. I'm not even here. I just need you to look the other way for a second a second

1335
04:41:29,799 --> 04:41:34,119
Yes, just a split second. I don't think it's too much to ask do you?

1336
04:41:34,799 --> 04:41:36,799
Then we can get on with our fight

1337
04:41:37,319 --> 04:41:39,720
That is correct. All right

1338
04:41:43,970 --> 04:41:45,970
bastard dishonor, oh

1339
04:41:47,240 --> 04:41:49,240
Sorry, I was aiming for your nuts

1340
04:41:51,340 --> 04:41:56,479
Whoa, that was close for a second there. I forgot that you were a killer

1341
04:41:57,000 --> 04:42:02,290
Sorry if I scared you I didn't mean to do that. Something's wrong with me today. I

1342
04:42:03,409 --> 04:42:05,209
Let my guard down

1343
04:42:05,209 --> 04:42:08,729
Getting sloppy. I got changed fast. I

1344
04:42:09,330 --> 04:42:16,159
Asked you something. Yeah, what is it? Mr. Cosplay? We're both assassins, right?

1345
04:42:16,680 --> 04:42:21,319
Why do we have to kill each other? Anyway, this game is ridiculous. I love it. It's absolutely meaningless

1346
04:42:21,880 --> 04:42:25,119
It's about determining who's best. That's what it's about

1347
04:42:26,159 --> 04:42:28,000
Can't argue with that

1348
04:42:28,000 --> 04:42:30,000
Well, then let's get started

1349
04:42:30,639 --> 04:42:35,310
What you want to shake hands? You just tried to kill me from behind

1350
04:42:36,169 --> 04:42:38,169
Not killers at least for now

1351
04:42:38,529 --> 04:42:45,610
This is a sign of sportsmanship that we respect each other before and after the fight good luck likewise

1352
04:42:46,889 --> 04:42:49,900
destroy spark

1353
04:43:06,520 --> 04:43:09,880
Is this guy an idiot or what hey look it's chat

1354
04:43:11,159 --> 04:43:17,040
You fell for the oldest trick in the book. Oh, man, you are something. Oh, this is the best

1355
04:43:17,720 --> 04:43:19,720
You really crack me up

1356
04:43:21,000 --> 04:43:23,000
I'm just gonna kill me

1357
04:43:23,520 --> 04:43:28,040
Seriously, I think I might really die from laughter. It hurts

1358
04:43:36,540 --> 04:43:46,220
He ate the blueberries and look at you you look like you're dead I guess it's time for a wake-up call

1359
04:43:53,290 --> 04:43:58,630
This is where it gets good good night

1360
04:44:01,590 --> 04:44:07,750
This is just what it's like to play Smash Brothers online

1361
04:44:08,470 --> 04:44:14,150
That was quite a move. I'll admit you've got it's like it's not fucking fun challenge had a taste

1362
04:44:14,590 --> 04:44:16,590
You'd be quite delicious

1363
04:44:16,869 --> 04:44:21,909
Fight for the seventh. Yeah, sure. Bring it on. I love a challenge

1364
04:44:22,470 --> 04:44:28,680
You're as good as dead

1365
04:44:29,119 --> 04:44:31,479
All right, destroy man. Let's go

1366
04:44:38,439 --> 04:44:40,439
Destroy pound

1367
04:44:42,659 --> 04:44:47,520
He's got a few he's got like someone to be in when he does that he does like three or four

1368
04:44:53,490 --> 04:44:55,490
I have to dodge underneath that or I think I can block it

1369
04:44:57,479 --> 04:45:02,479

1378
04:46:12,779 --> 04:46:22,319

04:50:07,090 --> 04:50:23,919
That cutscene could have played earlier don't cry like that

1396
04:50:25,509 --> 04:50:30,110
You're a killer aren't you? What? I can't hear you

1397
04:50:30,950 --> 04:50:41,709
Help me. What is this? I hear from a seventh ranked killer

04:50:42,349 --> 04:50:45,790

04:51:19,939 --> 04:51:21,939
$10,000 that's it

1403
04:51:22,540 --> 04:51:31,869

04:51:32,270 --> 04:51:35,279
You were cheater

1405
04:51:52,130 --> 04:51:56,779

I'm starting to think that you may be for real that fight was nuts. Yeah, that's fun

1407
04:52:07,799 --> 04:52:13,419
Hey when I hit number one, you better be looking the best

Marvellous

1412
04:52:46,580 --> 04:53:12,740
Destroy that speed up the emulator for a joke. No, why would I do that? I don't want to do that. I don't risk

1413
04:53:13,259 --> 04:53:25,500
Messing the whole thing up. It's not real hardware. It's I got real hardware in my hands. I got real hardware on the desk

1414
04:53:26,139 --> 04:53:31,139
The real hardware doesn't run the game. Well, I don't tell you

1415
04:53:32,020 --> 04:53:35,380
Just calling to let you know that the video you reserved is here

Title is how to please a woman in bed 101 part three. Oh

1417
04:53:41,340 --> 04:53:46,340
One of the girls here said that you might need a new pillow cover for this one, you know, just for protection

1418
04:53:47,060 --> 04:53:49,060
Thank you

1419
04:53:52,099 --> 04:53:57,659
Congratulations, mr. Touchdown your registration for the seventh UAA rank is now complete

1420
04:53:58,099 --> 04:54:04,659
As always we have facts you some information about the rankings in case you wish to continue your set

1421
04:54:05,259 --> 04:54:10,700
Please transfer the money into the designated term and get your nasty shit off the desk where you and Kim eat

1422
04:54:12,580 --> 04:54:17,380
We don't we mean Kim don't eat dinner up here on where my computer desk is

1423
04:54:18,740 --> 04:54:21,360
Why would we do that?

1424
04:54:22,860 --> 04:54:24,020
300 gram

1425
04:54:24,020 --> 04:54:39,319
You're hungry. You're in your one-room apartment

1426
04:54:40,240 --> 04:54:54,830
Well wouldn't if that wouldn't she just be in here she is

1427
04:54:55,709 --> 04:55:23,080
Save it again end of the stream. Not yet

1428
04:55:30,080 --> 04:55:35,979
No, man, that's end of the stream voice. No, how is that end of the stream voice?

1429
04:55:37,060 --> 04:55:43,900
New job. What is it? Why do I know like another katana? I'm almost ranked six. Where's the new katana?

1430
04:55:44,419 --> 04:55:55,110
There's a stupidest way to take a left

1431
04:56:06,020 --> 04:56:24,650
And we got to go to the gym we got to get the katana part if it's available

1432
04:56:25,490 --> 04:56:31,970
What the new model dumbass otaku? What's it look like? Of course, it's not done yet

1433
04:56:41,950 --> 04:56:56,459
Right to the gym no, no, no

1434
04:56:57,540 --> 04:57:23,540
Okay back to the gym. So we're this way take a right

1435
04:57:24,220 --> 04:57:30,130
Remember drive on the right side of the road. What are you doing? Remember when I was playing Grand Theft Auto and how?

1436
04:57:30,729 --> 04:57:35,090
Furious people would get because I only drive on the left side of the road into traffic. I

1437
04:57:36,549 --> 04:57:43,380
Remember it's cuz it's easier. You don't have to wait for people to burn you. You can go just weave around

1438
04:57:44,020 --> 04:57:54,459
All right bench press again

1439
04:58:19,220 --> 04:58:22,229
This hurts

1440
04:58:22,270 --> 04:58:30,459
Not gonna make it I have 30 seconds

1441
04:58:31,180 --> 04:58:45,759
Pepsi versus coke

1442
04:58:46,040 --> 04:59:00,700
coke

1443
04:59:00,700 --> 04:59:04,159
It's the same. No, it's a little different

1444
04:59:04,919 --> 04:59:09,439
Coke is spicier than Pepsi. Pepsi is smoother

1445
04:59:10,040 --> 04:59:16,799
Coke has a little bit more of a bite than Pepsi does Pepsi's tastes almost like it's not flat, but it's like a little spicier

1446
04:59:16,799 --> 04:59:18,799
It's got a little more bite than

1447
04:59:19,319 --> 04:59:28,409
Pepsi does

1448
04:59:29,810 --> 04:59:34,240
Dr. Pepper is the best

1449
04:59:34,240 --> 04:59:41,540
You know what actually in recent years, you know, it's really been taken over as the drink of choice for me for a soda

1450
04:59:42,279 --> 04:59:47,540
It's just regular ass sprite. I've kind of like it. It's crisp

1451
04:59:48,099 --> 04:59:54,389
It's refreshing I actually really like it just a little bit just you know, like those little baby cans

1452
04:59:55,150 --> 05:00:02,930
The ones that are like they look like they're like a jokey little display like a cartoon can I like those you just that's it

1453
05:00:02,930 --> 05:00:05,009
Just just a little one. Not just enough

1454
05:00:05,569 --> 05:00:21,110
All righty. Three hundred thousand. Let's go do the new job and we should unlock more assassin missions, which I haven't done all

1455
05:00:22,990 --> 05:00:27,029
McCrory, no, no, no, I don't like I don't like soda water like that

1456
05:00:27,830 --> 05:00:31,069
For me if I'm gonna drink soda, I gotta go all the way

1457
05:00:31,790 --> 05:00:37,950
Drinking something like LaCroix is like halfway for me. And it's just like if I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go the whole way

1458
05:00:38,590 --> 05:00:55,380
Where's Mountain Dew? No Mountain Dew sucks. No, I don't know. They somehow made it worse over the last ten years

1459
05:00:55,380 --> 05:01:00,259
I don't know what they did. It's just it's too sugary. I don't know. It's like 44 grams of sugar or something

1460
05:01:01,540 --> 05:01:08,560
It's not too bad the first rate God, that's me. Okay

1461
05:01:09,119 --> 05:01:15,400
Gassed in fill up cars with gas $2,000 for each car filled up. Absolutely

1462
05:01:19,240 --> 05:01:23,819
You know, what has objectively gotten worse is cool ranch Doritos. Oh

1463
05:01:25,700 --> 05:01:28,400
I don't I haven't had cool ranch Doritos in a long time

1464
05:01:29,060 --> 05:01:42,860
No, it's not that I had cool ranch Doritos. I don't even really eat regular Doritos anymore. I mean I

1465
05:01:43,500 --> 05:01:46,950
Not really

1466
05:01:46,950 --> 05:01:52,250
Cheese, it's a nice snack choice if I just want to just crunch on something

1467
05:01:55,200 --> 05:01:56,599
Oh, you know what's awesome?

1468
05:01:56,599 --> 05:02:03,860
Dill pickle lays potato chips. They are very very very great

1469
05:02:04,500 --> 05:02:11,189
They had trust me. They're pretty good Dill

1470
05:02:11,869 --> 05:02:13,590
lays potato chips

1471
05:02:13,590 --> 05:02:19,770
Rules the unspoken rules standard destroy dictate perseverance perseverance lends to money

1472
05:02:20,090 --> 05:02:23,689
Which during leads to wealth the world will forever remain closed to those who do not persevere

1473
05:02:24,250 --> 05:02:29,849
The god of gasoline is cruel lose your perseverance and you'll burn up. That is what perseverance means

1474
05:02:30,689 --> 05:02:32,689
Get working get working

1475
05:02:33,290 --> 05:02:38,000
Kettle chips. Yeah, I like kettle chips do that. They're up there at like a tier

1476
05:02:38,680 --> 05:02:45,419
Press the B button to pump gas into the car. Be sure to fill her up just the right amount. I

1477
05:02:47,439 --> 05:02:49,740
Don't remember this one

1478
05:03:02,619 --> 05:03:04,979
That person didn't even get any gas

1479
05:03:05,619 --> 05:03:12,419
The person drove in and just drove out with the same amount

1480
05:03:12,979 --> 05:03:30,450
Fuck this one actually sucks. Was that not it?

1481
05:03:31,009 --> 05:03:53,319
That's perfect. That was a pixel. Perfect. Well, you can go over you just can't go under. Okay. Well, it's it filled to the right amount

1482
05:03:53,840 --> 05:04:05,400
I'm overfilling it. Isn't part of the job that it's supposed to suck

1483
05:04:19,439 --> 05:04:22,560
I was gonna say yeah, that was a Mario damage sound

1484
05:04:23,439 --> 05:04:29,400
But I made a Mario reference like yesterday. I you got I can't make too many in a row

1485
05:04:42,220 --> 05:04:54,360
That was perfect. Let's go. It did sound just like it. What cut look at this car

1486
05:04:55,159 --> 05:04:59,560
What was that car that car didn't make any sense that car that car was made out of marshmallows

1487
05:05:00,279 --> 05:05:15,759
Goddamn it. It's a birthday cake car

1488
05:05:19,229 --> 05:05:24,270
Big cake that really isn't car cake. It's a birthday cake

1489
05:05:27,000 --> 05:05:29,479
These are hard to do. Look, it's gonna blow up on me

1490
05:05:37,209 --> 05:05:39,930
Was it $3,000 per car? That's actually gonna be a lot of money

1491
05:05:50,389 --> 05:05:52,389
20 probably 23

1492
05:05:53,909 --> 05:05:55,270
23

1493
05:05:55,270 --> 05:05:58,150
just as many

1494
05:05:58,430 --> 05:06:05,180
Cars filled up as there are categories for the New Year's Eve stream. You go ahead and check out the

1495
05:06:05,779 --> 05:06:07,779
Voting there is a poll going on right now

1496
05:06:08,380 --> 05:06:10,060
23 categories

1497
05:06:10,060 --> 05:06:17,599
Get your votes in the best and worst shit that happened on this stream over the last year

1498
05:06:17,599 --> 05:06:26,740
A lot of interesting stuff on there. Take that poll poll is open until the 31st at 12 p.m

1499
05:06:26,740 --> 05:06:33,959
Pacific and then that evening Pacific we will watch the ball drop and go over all the nominations and see what you guys selected

1500
05:06:34,619 --> 05:06:38,509
He's doing an ad. I'm doing an ad from my own stream

1501
05:06:39,229 --> 05:06:41,229
So the money just went in a circle

1502
05:06:45,950 --> 05:07:01,759
23 of you start from zero. Well 24 if you count the would you recommend Jerma to a friend? Oh a new mission nice

1503
05:07:02,279 --> 05:07:07,279
New assassin mission. Hopefully it's worth a hundred thousand dollars

1504
05:07:08,040 --> 05:07:18,229
Good job, what we got? So we left up pizza, but returns

1505
05:07:18,830 --> 05:07:23,229
Kills many as you can within the time the mission ends when time runs out. So I just to kill as many people as possible

1506
05:07:24,869 --> 05:07:26,790
4,000 per kill that's a lot

1507
05:07:26,790 --> 05:07:30,619
Kill a hundred enemies mission ends when all targets are dead

1508
05:07:31,139 --> 05:07:35,560
No time limit. Just that's a hundred people. That's a lot of people though

1509
05:07:35,560 --> 05:07:39,880
I feel like that's not good on a batting killing spree

1510
05:07:39,880 --> 05:07:46,569
We've done this before and then kill all the enemies within the time limit dark side mode will be activated mission ends

1511
05:07:48,209 --> 05:07:56,240
I'll do this one. This is the power

1512
05:07:58,560 --> 05:08:13,990
Let's go

1513
05:08:15,240 --> 05:08:16,680
Travis

1514
05:08:16,680 --> 05:08:19,720
100 enemy one is the one I used for big money

1515
05:08:20,639 --> 05:08:26,610
well, eventually when you get strong enough that you upgrade your attack power and you upgrade your katana to a point where

1516
05:08:26,970 --> 05:08:28,970
You can kill people in one hit

1517
05:08:29,290 --> 05:08:32,090
So that mission probably becomes pretty easy money

1518
05:08:33,130 --> 05:08:35,610
once you have like the third katana and

1519
05:08:35,970 --> 05:08:39,250
And plus seven in attack power

1520
05:08:40,330 --> 05:08:42,569
Big money. We'll try this

1521
05:08:43,209 --> 05:09:05,540
3k per kill is more money than 90k for a hundred

1522
05:09:06,540 --> 05:09:11,419
That's true. But you do you do have a time limit on the other one. No wonder

1523
05:09:13,549 --> 05:09:15,919
All right dark side here we go

1524
05:09:22,270 --> 05:09:32,419
Trying to remember the way the wee buttons like ZC it's

1525
05:09:34,340 --> 05:09:47,950
At least we get to see these animations no, don't slap the button

1526
05:09:49,950 --> 05:09:53,919
They kill both

1527
05:09:53,919 --> 05:10:01,790
For some reason I know B is the trigger on the week

1528
05:10:02,509 --> 05:10:07,430
But B for me, I don't know. I feel like it's a it's the face button up here at my thumb

1529
05:10:08,229 --> 05:10:14,090
It's been a while since I felt a wee controller. It's been like two years, right?

1530
05:10:15,189 --> 05:10:17,189
What's last we stream?

1531
05:10:17,310 --> 05:10:24,029

05:10:47,430 --> 05:10:49,799

1543
05:11:34,560 --> 05:11:45,610
No, we made videos of it. Oh, that's right. It was a green screen entry

1544
05:11:52,380 --> 05:11:59,880

I did it hurts my eyes

1547
05:12:23,270 --> 05:12:31,849
Mad world to me was like looking at a newspaper. It just that kind of hurts my head. I

1548
05:12:32,450 --> 05:12:39,389
Wish they did a remastered mode where they just like call it in all the spaces. Maybe I would want to play it

1549
05:12:39,990 --> 05:12:58,299
All right, don't get hit don't get hit don't get hit

1550
05:13:08,779 --> 05:13:25,049
Whoa, watch it. It was this guy again. Remember this guy. He wasn't even on the screen

Bros the screen froze for a second and I knew it was gonna stop

I saw it happening from my fucking face and it was the I knew it

1557
05:14:19,020 --> 05:14:23,900
Right when I hit him for that last time and it paused to do the swipe. Hey

05:14:24,580 --> 05:14:36,419

1562
05:15:06,450 --> 05:15:12,569

1563
05:15:13,409 --> 05:15:20,119
That's stupid. Oh

1564
05:15:20,119 --> 05:15:22,119

05:15:22,720 --> 05:15:26,439

And by mission, I mean like assassin number six

1579
05:18:12,560 --> 05:18:19,700

Do you eat dinner at your desk? I don't eat dinner at my desk. All right, let me get one of these

1581
05:18:33,689 --> 05:18:37,409
I haven't done one of these in a long time. I did like the first two or three in a row without a problem

1582
05:18:38,330 --> 05:19:00,580
Get hit don't get hit

1583
05:19:00,580 --> 05:19:02,580

05:19:47,680 --> 05:19:53,759
These ones are fucking hard. Ah

1586
05:19:54,479 --> 05:20:07,279
That's worse meltdown. What I'm just expelling demons out of my mouth. How is that a meltdown?

1587
05:20:07,759 --> 05:20:25,419
I'm trying to pick up trash. It's reliable these like $15 if to know it just get it out of dumpsters

1588
05:20:25,939 --> 05:20:28,560
Yeah, let's just get it out of a dumpster

1589
05:20:28,639 --> 05:20:56,409
Yeah, I need to do this like three dumpsters go play Lego Star Wars the complete saga. It's the best game

1590
05:20:56,409 --> 05:21:02,240
I played this whole decade

1591
05:21:02,479 --> 05:21:29,119
Okay, just two more. What is back here? What's on the mini map there? You gotta play the Lord of the Rings games

1592
05:21:29,319 --> 05:21:32,599
Yeah, the the Lord of the Rings ps2 games are on the list

1593
05:21:33,279 --> 05:21:37,419
And so is Mickey Mouse the magical quest starring Mickey Mouse

1594
05:21:38,099 --> 05:21:58,669
It's a hell of a game. Yeah, it's really good. You have a lot to play. Yeah, there's a lot of games to play

1595
05:21:59,150 --> 05:22:02,669
I give him my bike

1596
05:22:10,000 --> 05:22:36,119
Feel bad for that guy. I just need one more. I need it two more dumpsters and then get me on to the next battle. I

1597
05:22:36,759 --> 05:22:38,200
need a dumpster

1598
05:22:38,200 --> 05:22:42,279
anywhere dumpster

1599
05:22:42,759 --> 05:22:52,169
Dumpster there's gotta be a dumpster in here play Peggle. I think Peggle at least a few times

1600
05:22:52,830 --> 05:23:21,970
Seriously, what was that ball in here? I must I have a I got like four of these in a row

1601
05:23:23,250 --> 05:23:44,840
Where's WarioWare? I already streamed WarioWare. I did all of it. You play urban chaos. I think so was on the ps2 list

1602
05:23:45,319 --> 05:23:57,700
Do it more well tell Nintendo to make them they made one 12 years ago

1603
05:23:58,340 --> 05:24:10,000
And then they made a fake half WarioWare game. Where's the WarioWare switch?

1604
05:24:10,599 --> 05:24:23,909
Where is it? I'll be fair to Nintendo though. This probably I mean how many more different types of weird?

1605
05:24:24,990 --> 05:24:26,990
Micro games do you think they can come up with?

1606
05:24:27,349 --> 05:24:33,040
Maybe they could do some more

1607
05:24:33,080 --> 05:24:34,799
but

1608
05:24:34,799 --> 05:24:44,119
They could but maybe this don't feel like it but they have had a bunch of new games released

1609
05:24:44,119 --> 05:24:49,849
They could do a lot of it's t-shirts. It's kind of not what I wanted

1610
05:25:01,909 --> 05:25:11,700
Dumpster give me a dumpster. I need two dumpsters

1611
05:25:12,259 --> 05:25:18,270

05:25:18,270 --> 05:25:24,540

Blind dumb blind dumb blind dumb blind dumb blind dumb

1615
05:25:44,069 --> 05:26:03,360
Where do you see this? What did I miss from trying to have a meltdown while I'm going to bed? Oh, don't worry

1616
05:26:03,360 --> 05:26:15,130
There's not gonna be a meltdown

1617
05:26:15,369 --> 05:26:22,560
Another t-shirts. There's not gonna be a meltdown. Don't worry

1618
05:26:22,959 --> 05:26:31,599
I don't do those anymore. I watched like a portion of Jump King VOD and I was like, I'm not doing this anymore

1619
05:26:31,599 --> 05:26:33,200
I'm not gonna

1620
05:26:33,200 --> 05:26:35,000
Not happen anymore

1621
05:26:35,000 --> 05:26:48,380
It happened yesterday

1622
05:26:50,180 --> 05:27:05,930
No, it didn't. Where is this thing? It's the pink thing on the map. Where is it? Wait, what?

1623
05:27:06,529 --> 05:27:20,630
Hey, I was just standing on there right here

1624
05:27:21,349 --> 05:27:28,840

05:28:13,959 --> 05:28:15,959
Missing Nancy Drew right now

1630
05:28:16,159 --> 05:28:22,360
Don't worry. She'll be back when there's another technical problem on stream and I just go what the hell am I gonna do today?

1631
05:28:37,630 --> 05:28:39,630
Nancy Drew will return

1632
05:28:39,909 --> 05:28:45,490
Pay the three hundred thousand dollars. Let's go rank six

1633
05:28:46,130 --> 05:28:49,330
Let's go

1634
05:28:49,569 --> 05:29:05,000
God hand play God hand. I think I tried to play God hand and I was during one of those PlayStation 2

1635
05:29:05,560 --> 05:29:07,000
fuckface streams

1636
05:29:07,000 --> 05:29:10,529
Really?

1637
05:29:10,529 --> 05:29:13,490
I've played so many old games. I

1638
05:29:18,860 --> 05:29:20,380
Probably have played

1639
05:29:20,380 --> 05:29:25,180
60 to 70 PlayStation 2 games on this stream and like a hundred PlayStation 1 games or something

1640
05:29:39,919 --> 05:29:41,479
The beach

1641
05:29:41,479 --> 05:29:47,470
Let's go ahead and

1642
05:29:47,470 --> 05:29:50,959
fridge

1643
05:29:50,959 --> 05:29:54,049
Go to the toilet

1644
05:29:54,090 --> 05:30:18,500
Save it up and go do this mission. What's the objective of the game to be the number one assassin?

1645
05:30:18,819 --> 05:30:23,299
I'm currently rank seven

1646
05:30:23,900 --> 05:30:29,400
Trying to climb to rank six

1647
05:30:30,000 --> 05:30:47,930
Trying to be number one. You know it the cat. What about the cat?

1648
05:30:48,930 --> 05:31:09,159
Cats fine about the cards. Well, look at the cards. Don't worry. We will we will we will I promise I promise I promise

1649
05:31:10,560 --> 05:31:24,430
To the beach end of the stream voice coming up after this

1650
05:31:25,389 --> 05:31:31,029
After this ranked mission, we're gonna probably call it. I'm gonna go eat some dinner

1651
05:31:31,630 --> 05:31:33,630
We'll pick back up tomorrow afternoon

1652
05:31:33,830 --> 05:31:35,830
And we'll probably finish the game tomorrow, too

1653
05:31:36,229 --> 05:31:42,049
Thank you. It's an invisible wall. You can't

1654
05:31:42,650 --> 05:31:48,720

Just up ahead so I'm supposed to fight on the beach is that is one of the conditions why

1658
05:32:20,669 --> 05:32:22,669
That's for you to figure out

1659
05:32:25,060 --> 05:32:35,470
What other hidden talents do you have Travis go any higher and I will kill you myself

1660
05:32:36,790 --> 05:32:44,270
Not until you become number one. We have a deal remember so hurry up and go get him. Yes, your highness

1661
05:33:05,240 --> 05:33:08,830
I

1662
05:33:12,349 --> 05:33:13,630

Get blindfolded and he puts plugs in his ears, and we both have to try to find a way to play the game

Wait, wouldn't he would just be able to play I?

1675
05:36:14,580 --> 05:36:17,580

He gets the screen, but you get the controller

1678
05:37:02,520 --> 05:37:19,669
Where am I that might work in games that are a little less complicated than enough things in the Mario's complicated

1679
05:37:19,669 --> 05:37:21,669
No, it's not that might actually work. Oh

05:37:41,240 --> 05:37:43,479
Landmines

1683
05:37:52,439 --> 05:37:56,189
I

1684
05:37:56,189 --> 05:38:06,159
Thought I had it again

1685
05:38:07,119 --> 05:38:25,659
Popping in to say hello. Love you guys. Hey, what's up? What's going on my dad?

1686
05:38:39,450 --> 05:39:07,770
Guns that but my head hurts after that. Let's give me headache. Nice aim it is

1687
05:39:08,610 --> 05:39:10,610
Yeah, that's pretty good

1688
05:39:14,159 --> 05:39:16,599
Just just just just

1689
05:39:17,360 --> 05:39:20,240
Can look at the cards to yeah, you're right. You're right

1690
05:39:21,400 --> 05:39:25,529
This chest over here to hold on. Oh

1691
05:39:27,580 --> 05:39:29,459
No, I can't go back

1692
05:39:29,459 --> 05:39:32,200
No, they're gone forever

1693
05:39:33,240 --> 05:39:45,250
Damn it. You should play metal wolf chaos. All right, I beat that game

1694
05:39:52,990 --> 05:40:03,569
That was where the greedy Grinner was originated. Yeah, how many?

1695
05:40:04,450 --> 05:40:10,200
Where are these people?

1696
05:40:17,779 --> 05:40:22,069
Not soft-locked

1697
05:40:26,729 --> 05:40:32,599
All right, that's it

1698
05:40:32,799 --> 05:40:35,029
Let me something wrong

1699
05:40:35,029 --> 05:40:49,590
Yet, I don't want to do this for anymore

1700
05:40:50,189 --> 05:40:52,770
Shake the we both

1701
05:40:52,770 --> 05:40:58,790
Right. Is that it? That's it

1702
05:40:59,229 --> 05:41:05,560
Damn, that was a lot

1703
05:41:26,860 --> 05:41:30,639
Of course every time

1704
05:41:31,439 --> 05:41:34,959
Every time I could have used that I could have used that shit. I

1705
05:41:36,240 --> 05:41:47,029
Would have loved to have had that five minutes ago. I

1706
05:41:56,529 --> 05:42:11,540
Think it's most of the money. Yeah, it's money mostly money the mini-map. Okay the mini-map has them

1707
05:42:29,750 --> 05:42:31,750
Don more

1708
05:42:32,029 --> 05:42:34,509
Levels it goes on forever. Yeah, this is a long one. Oh

1709
05:42:35,509 --> 05:42:38,360
I guess to be fair. It's

1710
05:42:38,360 --> 05:42:44,279
It's just the beach. The other levels are in buildings. So I guess maybe it's the same length, but

1711
05:42:45,159 --> 05:42:50,650
Car that's what I want

1712
05:43:02,009 --> 05:43:09,799
After you after you swing for finishing blow swing again during the slow-mo motion part to cut for more people

1713
05:43:14,200 --> 05:43:45,069
I thought that was a foot grenade. Hello

1714
05:44:07,380 --> 05:44:09,580
All those things actually apply to me

1715
05:44:22,080 --> 05:44:32,869
You've gone from dodging your meteoric rise of stupidity is truly painful to observe

1716
05:44:35,840 --> 05:44:37,840
Top seven streamer

1717
05:44:51,150 --> 05:44:57,790
Full health save the game

1718
05:45:08,680 --> 05:45:23,639
No more mines right now you have to go shit in the ocean to save no, it's probably a poor party writer

1719
05:45:24,599 --> 05:45:26,400
There is

1720
05:45:26,400 --> 05:45:29,720
It's not really a poor body. Is it?

1721
05:45:30,040 --> 05:45:45,430
Travis this is just common sense in Calgary. The king of suplexes. Remember now Satan's ferris wheel the belly to belly

1722
05:45:48,849 --> 05:45:52,560
Belly to belly

1723
05:45:54,180 --> 05:46:15,169
There are bathrooms at beaches, yeah all over the place no, I mean

1724
05:46:16,729 --> 05:46:18,729
Bathrooms that are at the beach

1725
05:46:23,709 --> 05:46:25,709

1726
05:46:27,360 --> 05:46:33,840

05:46:57,310 --> 05:47:03,990
Yep, do you like killing? Yeah live for it

1729
05:47:06,970 --> 05:47:15,990
Can't say never felt it do you accept death death never crossed my mind

1730
05:47:16,869 --> 05:47:25,040
This is the only truth. You are still a mere but that's not a good thing, you know

1731
05:47:25,580 --> 05:47:27,580
Seeking meaning in everything

1732
05:47:27,979 --> 05:47:35,500
Especially killing. That's a bad habit among smart little girls these days come closer and you will understand

1733
05:47:36,979 --> 05:47:40,630
I'm ready

1734
05:47:41,229 --> 05:47:44,310
Anytime just your ordinary assassin

1735
05:47:47,700 --> 05:47:53,020
No one else has a light normal assassins don't shoot the shit like this they see their target

1736
05:47:53,020 --> 05:48:14,279
And kill them let's see you get out of this predicament dead

1737
05:48:21,200 --> 05:48:23,200

1738
05:48:29,650 --> 05:48:33,200
Let go those

1739
05:48:33,200 --> 05:48:50,319
I'm good. Nice trap. I like your style. Maybe I can steal a kiss before I steal your life

1740
05:48:55,479 --> 05:48:57,479
Grenades work. Oh

1741
05:48:57,840 --> 05:48:59,840
I just blocked it with my back

1742
05:49:01,369 --> 05:49:02,650

1743
05:49:02,650 --> 05:49:04,889

I'm not good at this one. I'm not good at this one. I'm not good at this one. I'm not good at this one

1752
05:51:27,080 --> 05:51:29,389
Hug wall hug the wall

Belly to belly that was really really amazing damage. Oh fuck what's I'm coming. I don't I can't get the help

1757
05:52:57,119 --> 05:53:10,080

1758
05:53:27,119 --> 05:53:30,330
Oh

1759
05:53:30,330 --> 05:53:46,580

1760
05:53:47,099 --> 05:53:54,139

1763
05:54:24,959 --> 05:54:47,979
Greedy, how did I not hit you? Oh my fucking god. I'm so stupid. Oh

1764
05:55:07,479 --> 05:55:10,479
This is like a super move. I don't know it does she throws grenades

1765
05:55:13,930 --> 05:55:16,299
Where am I my in the hole?

1766
05:55:31,479 --> 05:55:47,450
My hands are sweating. Okay, I'm good. You shouldn't be able to do that with every time

1767
05:55:53,409 --> 05:56:11,540
Fucking kidding me. She's invincible during that move. She just did it like four times in a row

1768
05:56:12,200 --> 05:56:41,259
She's in it four times in a row. She's got like 15 moves. I hate this ball

1769
05:56:41,880 --> 05:56:58,180
Hates buff. I'm trying to talk the fucking walls, man

1770
05:56:58,180 --> 05:57:06,509

1771
05:57:07,229 --> 05:57:52,740
How did you get stunned out of that? I should have I mess around anymore. I'll put the wall hug the wall hug the wall

1772
05:57:53,259 --> 05:58:10,720
Let's go. I

1773
05:58:10,720 --> 05:58:24,840
Ain't messing around. I'm good. I'm getting in there hard all the way in

1774
05:58:25,360 --> 05:58:33,889
Run run run. Just don't oh, no pressure. No pressure. No all pressure. We mean no pressure all pressure. I guess do a full health

1775
05:58:34,290 --> 05:58:38,849
No, I know the mechanics. I know what you're doing. It's not even a big deal. You've got nothing on me now

1776
05:58:39,709 --> 05:58:59,200
Where are they? There's one like right here. There's one like right here. There's one right here. There's one like Stan

1777
05:58:59,200 --> 05:59:41,029
It's just standing on I knew it. What no mercy. No mercy

1778
06:00:01,159 --> 06:00:06,909
That's fun, this is not mercy

1779
06:00:07,590 --> 06:00:14,869
You can't kill a woman did say no mercy. So if you can't kill a woman you are less than a thug

1780
06:00:15,229 --> 06:00:17,229
You'll never make it to the top

1781
06:00:17,830 --> 06:00:27,009
That's okay. I seem to have a thing for stupid pathetic men like you. I can accept defeat. It comes from your hand

1782
06:00:27,009 --> 06:00:29,709
I will let you in on a secret

1783
06:00:30,750 --> 06:00:33,029
Assassins must die when they lose

1784
06:00:34,229 --> 06:00:37,150
Clumpy mascara look back doesn't look like looks painful

1785
06:00:37,709 --> 06:00:46,380
Never forget me, huh? Thank you the moment you hesitated I felt your embrace

1786
06:00:46,939 --> 06:00:52,680
Hold up academics like to fantasize too, you know

1787
06:00:53,380 --> 06:00:56,250
Wait number six. No

1788
06:00:59,689 --> 06:01:03,599
When that kill me too

1789
06:01:03,639 --> 06:01:09,360
I'm standing two feet in front of you. Forgive me number six. We're meant to shame you

1790
06:01:10,000 --> 06:01:20,490
Not a very smooth victories that Travis but a win is a win is that's all that matters I

1791
06:01:21,130 --> 06:01:24,930
Hate to award you these but you are now sixth in rank

1792
06:01:26,090 --> 06:01:29,729
What was her name? That's a special grenade. That is not important anymore

1793
06:01:30,369 --> 06:01:31,729
You're right

1794
06:01:31,729 --> 06:01:33,729
But I owe her at least that

1795
06:01:34,130 --> 06:01:37,040
Holly Summers born is no

1796
06:01:37,880 --> 06:01:40,509
Just her name

1797
06:01:44,479 --> 06:01:46,479
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1798
06:01:46,840 --> 06:01:51,840
What's the question marks for what does that do?

1799
06:01:59,159 --> 06:02:07,880
What what am I doing? I might like letting her out to rest at sea or something

1800
06:02:07,880 --> 06:02:37,959
I don't remember this part. Don't carry this lady's body around

1801
06:02:38,639 --> 06:02:43,950
Obtain the US military secret, please give to dr. Naomi

1802
06:02:44,549 --> 06:03:01,119
We try cook this wasn't available. I

1803
06:03:01,970 --> 06:03:13,610
Couldn't do that before it was grayed out Holly. I was late in saying this but I love your soul

1804
06:03:14,130 --> 06:03:16,130
Rest in peace

1805
06:03:18,259 --> 06:03:21,020
That was not a respectful way to put somebody to a grave

1806
06:03:22,500 --> 06:03:25,900
Could have leaned out in the late

1807
06:03:27,979 --> 06:03:29,459
Sand

1808
06:03:29,459 --> 06:03:31,220
He just

1809
06:03:31,220 --> 06:03:32,700
dropped her

1810
06:03:32,700 --> 06:03:35,540
Tossed her into the hole. Oh my goodness. That's bad

1811
06:03:36,619 --> 06:03:47,159
six

1812
06:03:47,159 --> 06:03:55,669
So started at 11. We are at the pretty much exact halfway point of the game

1813
06:03:57,229 --> 06:04:09,240
Perfect timing. I do want to see the other weapon though

1814
06:04:09,520 --> 06:04:28,450
I'm gonna see the cards and I want to see the new weapon and I'll play with the cat. Yes

1815
06:04:33,189 --> 06:04:38,669
How many videos do I have why would they still allow me to

1816
06:04:43,060 --> 06:04:48,349
Mr. Touchdown, we don't have any more porn videos left. You have all of them

1817
06:04:56,250 --> 06:05:00,650
UAA rank is complete. We look forward to hearing from you

1818
06:05:04,080 --> 06:05:06,439
350 I think it goes up by 50,000 every time

1819
06:05:07,080 --> 06:05:10,509
Yeah

1820
06:05:10,509 --> 06:05:27,700
350 look the cards cool. I like this one. I like this one. I

1823
06:05:34,639 --> 06:05:41,099
Like a like the praying mantis. I like this. It's like spider-man one

1824
06:05:42,099 --> 06:05:44,680
Some of these are really cool. I missed this one somehow. Oh

1825
06:05:48,069 --> 06:05:50,069
Well, I missed one

1826
06:05:50,150 --> 06:06:06,259
Is there a mask for a killer seven guys? I never played killer seven

1827
06:06:06,900 --> 06:06:14,310
Get it get it get it

1828
06:06:15,029 --> 06:06:25,580
Good cat. Let me save it here

1829
06:06:26,259 --> 06:06:30,540
So we can have a place to start from tomorrow. I don't know if I'm gonna I don't think I'm gonna buy the sword right now

1830
06:06:30,540 --> 06:06:45,580
I just want to see it. I'm gonna look at it. Maybe I will buy it. Oh, righty

1831
06:06:47,139 --> 06:06:48,740
Let's take it

1832
06:06:48,740 --> 06:06:51,299
It'll be too expensive. Anyways, yeah

1833
06:06:56,599 --> 06:07:02,509
Job, let's go. See the beam katana upgrade

1834
06:07:03,509 --> 06:07:24,000
You gotta go through here in the ass in the ass

1835
06:07:24,799 --> 06:07:26,360
and

1836
06:07:26,360 --> 06:07:32,310
Turn TV is the worst emote on twitch. I'm actually stuck. I can't drive this

06:07:37,400 --> 06:07:45,069
Yeah, I mean, that's I'm not gonna what am I gonna get rid of it? Why would I delete any emotes right now?

1838
06:07:45,750 --> 06:07:47,919
When I

1839
06:07:47,919 --> 06:07:53,290
It's doing its best

1840
06:07:53,290 --> 06:08:04,840
Is it the most use this has ever gotten did somebody just do a giant F and then say fuck you in the middle scroll up

1841
06:08:04,840 --> 06:08:06,000
Did you see that?

1842
06:08:06,000 --> 06:08:12,090
One two three four counts five accounts made a giant F and it says fuck you in the middle

1843
06:08:12,689 --> 06:08:16,479
Somebody grab I want to screenshot that that's insane

1844
06:08:17,119 --> 06:08:28,500
It was unintentional

1845
06:08:30,259 --> 06:08:34,659
Where the hell did you get this I swear you can get your hands on almost anything these days

1846
06:08:35,020 --> 06:08:44,299
Scares me to think a thing like this is out in the world. See what I can do. It's not available yet

1847
06:08:50,459 --> 06:08:55,840
Did you get it let's see

1848
06:08:55,840 --> 06:09:04,360
Fuck you with a big F. That's insane. That's awesome

1849
06:09:04,919 --> 06:09:14,319
All right, that's uh, that's gonna wrap it up for tonight. That's a that's a perfect clean six hours

1850
06:09:15,000 --> 06:09:19,639
Plus that gives us time to do probably like six to seven hours tomorrow to finish the game

1851
06:09:20,159 --> 06:09:23,509
And then after that is the New Year's Eve stream

1852
06:09:26,349 --> 06:09:34,560
Save it again. I just did I just did right before. Oh, well, you want to save because I gave them. Yeah. Yeah

1853
06:09:35,119 --> 06:09:46,110
I'll do it again. What time is the New Year's stream gonna start 6 p.m. Pacific is the New Year's Eve stream

1854
06:09:46,590 --> 06:09:52,029
starting at 9 Eastern it's to make sure that we can do all the festivities and

1855
06:09:52,470 --> 06:09:54,470
Count down the ball drop

1856
06:09:54,830 --> 06:10:12,779
Eastern time and then for Pacific time, I'm going to spend it with Kim. I did not spend New Year's Eve with Kim last year

1857
06:10:13,700 --> 06:10:17,259
So her and I are going to hang out

1858
06:10:17,979 --> 06:10:24,479
stuck again

1859
06:10:24,479 --> 06:10:26,919
I'm trying to back up and I won't let me

1860
06:10:27,520 --> 06:10:48,299
I'm right in front of a cop too. Whatever. I'm just walking. Yeah, we'll continue no more heroes tomorrow. We will beat it tomorrow and

1861
06:10:48,900 --> 06:10:54,150
then after New Year's

1862
06:10:54,689 --> 06:11:00,529
Depending on how into this I am how into no more heroes. We might just do the second one right after

1863
06:11:01,049 --> 06:11:06,090
Well, maybe we'll do it the week after maybe next but do something else for a few streams. I don't know

1864
06:11:06,810 --> 06:11:13,419
But I do want to play the second one. All right, save it here

1865
06:11:22,270 --> 06:11:28,139
Rhythm heaven rhythm rhythm heaven. I will I will we but I will play rhythm heaven. I swear

1866
06:11:29,099 --> 06:11:39,669
All right. I will see you guys tomorrow. If you stick around we're gonna do the bits and subs and everything

1867
06:11:40,430 --> 06:11:44,189
Thanks again for watching

1868
06:11:44,189 --> 06:11:51,919
Maybe we'll see you tomorrow that will conclude part one of no more heroes. We addition

1869
06:11:52,759 --> 06:11:53,759
quotes

1870
06:11:53,759 --> 06:12:18,700
This music's pretty good. But you know, pretty good pretty good. He doesn't he doesn't hate. What am I? He hates the cat

1871
06:12:19,459 --> 06:12:21,459
What do you mean? He hates the cat?

1872
06:12:21,580 --> 06:12:36,590
That's not true. Let's get the fun. I'll get this music. I played with the cat every time. I

1873
06:12:41,540 --> 06:12:49,119
Played with the cat every time. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Let's do bits

1874
06:12:49,720 --> 06:12:52,040
bits bits bits bits we had a

1875
06:12:52,560 --> 06:12:55,569
Lot of subs came in today

1876
06:12:55,729 --> 06:12:57,729
derma sucks gave a shitload

1877
06:12:57,970 --> 06:13:10,950
German sucks gave 20 community subs right at the very beginning of the stream too. So thank you for that clown connoisseur gave 500 bits

1878
06:13:10,950 --> 06:13:12,830
Hey German, thank you for the content

1879
06:13:12,830 --> 06:13:19,439
Thank you the five dolls clown connoisseur. I'm glad you have fun. Glad you like it

1880
06:13:23,540 --> 06:13:31,939
Evil program. Thanks in 300 bits. No message. Just three dollars 300 bits. Thank you evil program right after that

1881
06:13:31,939 --> 06:13:39,150
We had respected disrespect for 500 bits five dolls. No message on this one. Just

1882
06:13:40,029 --> 06:13:42,349
500 bits. Thank you. Thanks a lot guys

1883
06:13:45,240 --> 06:13:51,919
Gnarly gave 250 here. I feel like you just streamed this game as an excuse to put Travis in the next rumble and honestly

1884
06:13:51,919 --> 06:13:56,990
I'm off for it. He wouldn't be a very hard character to make

1885
06:13:57,590 --> 06:14:12,009
Just brown jacket glasses and that hair would be pretty easy character to make when is the next rumble? We talked about the next rumble

1886
06:14:13,569 --> 06:14:19,470
Yesterday at the end of the stream and I don't really have any details for it, but the next rumble is gonna be a charity rumble

1887
06:14:20,110 --> 06:14:34,080
So I'll give more details on that when I have them fruit charity. Well, it won't be live-action. It'll be in a game

1888
06:14:34,599 --> 06:14:42,659
But thank you, darling. Thank you sad vague of the 250 man. Nancy Drew finally got barely interesting. I'm really glad you hung with it

1889
06:14:42,659 --> 06:14:45,540
It's at least becoming a wannabe Godhand poser game now

1890
06:14:46,139 --> 06:14:53,659
Are you implying that no more heroes is a poser Godham Godhand poser game?

1891
06:14:54,259 --> 06:15:03,380
It's not there are no lightsabers in God him

1892
06:15:03,939 --> 06:15:11,020
Hey Bacchus, thanks for the 500 bits. I'm so glad you love this game, too. It's my favorite game on the Wii

1893
06:15:11,020 --> 06:15:15,209
It's probably one of the best games to come out on the Wii. I don't have the Wiimote in my hand

1894
06:15:15,209 --> 06:15:17,209
And I'm still moving my arms around like an idiot

1895
06:15:17,509 --> 06:15:27,650
Yeah, it's one of the best games to come out on the platform both one and two

1896
06:15:28,450 --> 06:15:33,119
Thank you Bacchus though for sure

1897
06:15:34,580 --> 06:15:40,340
Zoogily, thanks for the thousand bits Zoogily ten dollars. Thanks for all the laughs over the years. Jerma heart Jerma auto

1899
06:15:47,200 --> 06:15:54,689
There isn't one enabled you

1900
06:15:54,810 --> 06:15:58,119
Thank You Zoogily for the 1,000 bits

1901
06:15:58,900 --> 06:16:01,770

1902
06:16:01,770 --> 06:16:03,970
Gooberry juice. Thanks for the 500 bits Gooberry

1903
06:16:04,290 --> 06:16:06,950
This is definitely one of my favorite games and I'm so happy you're playing it

1904
06:16:07,169 --> 06:16:11,849
But I guess I wasn't prepared for how much the Drew crew would hate it

1905
06:16:12,689 --> 06:16:15,450
Because of the shame I now feel I'm going to go home

1906
06:16:16,490 --> 06:16:21,520
watch anime take a piss and

1907
06:16:22,520 --> 06:16:39,229
Commit to puke coo with a beam sword. Well, thank you for the 500 bits Gooberry juice drew crew approved. We can't have to

1908
06:16:40,069 --> 06:16:43,669
Fight in communities. They can't be Drew crew versus everybody else

1909
06:16:44,470 --> 06:16:56,270
The Drew crew didn't even hate this. Yes, they were. Yes, they can be there will be

1910
06:16:57,069 --> 06:17:02,610
Drew crew versus team Travis

1911
06:17:03,209 --> 06:17:11,950
Wow, never thought I'd see the day that the community would be so split now

1912
06:17:12,709 --> 06:17:20,049
Thank You Gooberry appreciate it though, it's boo. Thanks for the 400 bits boo

1913
06:17:20,889 --> 06:17:25,740
Just want to say I remember you mentioned hash house as your favorite place for a sit-down burger

1914
06:17:26,340 --> 06:17:33,220
Went with friends and that place was great. Thanks for the recommendation never went even though I live in Vegas

1915
06:17:33,619 --> 06:17:38,110

It's so good. It's so I want it right now

1919
06:17:54,549 --> 06:18:03,650
Why can't I just have it right now? Yeah, I'm glad you liked it. It's

1920
06:18:04,569 --> 06:18:08,849
Awesome. I'm in one of the last time I went to hash house. I

1921
06:18:09,810 --> 06:18:11,930
Actually was sitting there. I don't even need the menu

1922
06:18:12,650 --> 06:18:19,990
Okay, don't even need the menu. I know what I am gonna order. That's right, sir. The waiter comes over. Okay, I was like

06:18:20,650 --> 06:18:24,049

06:18:24,970 --> 06:18:27,330
The blue cheeseburger and he looked at me he goes

1925
06:18:28,650 --> 06:18:33,909
We don't have any more but we ran out of meat like we don't have any meat that it's all gone

1926
06:18:33,909 --> 06:18:35,750
Because they when it's gone, it's gone

1927
06:18:35,750 --> 06:18:41,819
They had that their meat is fucking phenomenal and they ran out and they were like we don't have any more

Is that when the cars are they just try to sell a shitload of cars in a row? I

1936
06:19:35,580 --> 06:19:40,259
Don't know what that is. It's just like there's a you can it's better. I don't know what that means

1937
06:19:40,259 --> 06:19:43,479
I think that's just like it's just no, I don't celebrate either one of those

1938
06:19:44,080 --> 06:19:48,770
Just two hundred dollars off like a thirty thousand dollar car or something, right? I don't know

1939
06:19:49,330 --> 06:19:55,060

you've been subbed for five years or

1945
06:20:27,979 --> 06:20:37,979
You don't have a sub. Thanks for fucking being here. But seriously, there's a lot of subs now

1956
06:21:28,380 --> 06:21:31,380
Please please do another stream of heroes of might and magic 3

1957
06:21:31,700 --> 06:21:34,580
I really enjoyed fanboying with you over how good the game is

1958
06:21:34,979 --> 06:21:43,380
Particularly since you seem like you were generally having fun with it. I would probably want to make a custom scenario if I ever did

1959
06:21:43,380 --> 06:21:44,180
it again

1960
06:21:44,180 --> 06:21:48,549
it'd be nice to do that and actually make a an

1961
06:21:50,119 --> 06:21:54,560
Adventure that happens that is played out on stream. That'd be more fun. I think

1962
06:21:55,279 --> 06:22:05,849
But yeah, I mean I'm terrible at that game, but I do love it miss Lily T

1963
06:22:05,849 --> 06:22:11,009
Thanks for the 255 two dollars and 55 cents. It's good to see you playing games that you enjoy. I

1964
06:22:13,500 --> 06:22:17,880
Love no more heroes. I do enjoy it very much. So

1965
06:22:19,700 --> 06:22:21,700
Hill Sint

1966
06:22:21,700 --> 06:22:25,939

1967
06:22:26,619 --> 06:22:37,069
Thanks for the five dolls team Travis. I mean, I know I don't want to tear the community apart here

1968
06:22:37,229 --> 06:22:39,869
You're gonna get team Travis you're gonna get drew crew

1969
06:22:40,590 --> 06:22:43,150
The different days are different things

1970
06:22:43,509 --> 06:22:57,400
Appreciate it though. And finally we have blueberry juice for another 500 bits from blueberry juice. This is my proudest accomplishment

1971
06:22:57,400 --> 06:23:04,349
Oh, you were in there. You were part of that. You were part of that. I

1972
06:23:05,860 --> 06:23:12,479
Still I can't fucking believe it. I have to show this on stream for people in the bod to really understand what the hell is going

1973
06:23:12,479 --> 06:23:13,439
on here

1974
06:23:13,439 --> 06:23:19,840
Because I'm sure people are gonna be like, what's he talking about?

1975
06:23:20,560 --> 06:23:23,900
Look at this. This is one two, three, four five

1976
06:23:23,900 --> 06:23:30,740
I think there was even a sixth person, but this is five different people all in the middle of spam, by the way

1977
06:23:31,259 --> 06:23:38,020
so people were just spamming the German TV mode and

1978
06:23:38,619 --> 06:24:06,740
We got a one in a million a fuck you spelling out the F. I mean the the one

1979
06:24:07,740 --> 06:24:13,700
Then what the person under the fuck you is the only out but that still don't matter. That's just that could be a thick line

1980
06:24:14,340 --> 06:24:20,740
