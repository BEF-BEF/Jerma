1
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:09,700
How you doing? Welcome back to a stream. I'll be doing good. I'll be doing well. Pretty cool.

2
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:19,989
We're back on Sunday for some more Omega Gaming Weekend. I told you I thought maybe I'd be here

3
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:30,219
on Monday or Sunday maybe. I don't know. You missed the last stream. It was a 14 hour stream.

4
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,739
Went all the way into Saturday. Now here we are on Sunday to do some more of what I would,

5
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:43,819
what I've coined, you know, trademarks and stuff like that trying to figure it out.

6
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:56,730
Omega Gaming Weekend. So yeah, that's really cool. He's keeping promises kept. He's keeping his

7
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:08,550
promises. I was actually in here at the pre-stream and had the suss changed to Monday and I was like,

8
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,919
no, no, I'm just kidding. I'm doing today. I mean, a lot of people that got, you know,

9
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,759
they made Omega Gaming Weekend t-shirts were a little annoyed when I made it on Monday.

10
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,550
But yeah, today we're going to be doing Breath of the Wild. I'm going in here with a completely

11
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,909
open mind. I am not going to say anything about a Brom software game that I may have played

12
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:45,530
recently, six months ago, whatever. I've never played Breath of the Wild. I don't know. All I

13
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:53,909
know about, this is all I know. All I know is it's an open world Zelda game where your weapons break.

14
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:02,069
That's it. I don't know anything else. So if you're going to be a backseat Barry today,

15
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:10,360
keep in mind, I have no idea what you're even referring to. If I need help, I'll ask for it,

16
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:27,419
or I might just look over a chat and just see the answer. Backseat Barrys, yeah. Malled incoming.

17
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:40,219
Can you even mauled? Can you mauled in a Zelda game? Is that even possible? I don't, okay. Let's

18
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:50,469
also talk about this real quick. The last Zelda game that I opened was Chlorine Eyes Princess.

19
00:03:51,110 --> 00:04:01,030
That's the last one I played. Twilight Princess. Sorry, that's what it was. Twilight Princess.

20
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,479
Sorry, I got it wrong. Yeah, Twilight Princess is the last one that I played,

21
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:15,909
and I stopped after the first three hours. I hate the way that game looks. That whole game looks

22
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,149
like you opened your eyes in a pool and then looked at light and shit. It's Chlorine Eyes.

23
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:33,110
That whole game is Chlorine Eyes. I cannot play it. All the bloom. There's so much weird bloom,

24
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,879
chlorine bloom, but that's a lot. And I didn't play anything else after that.

25
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:44,439
And I've never played Wind Waker. The only thing I know about Wind Waker is

26
00:04:48,600 --> 00:05:02,089
and there's a boat on the screen. I don't know anything else. Play that too. You would like it,

27
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:05,610
but I don't really play Zelda. I'm telling you, I just don't really play Zelda games.

28
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,649
Let's see if my opinion will change. Let's find out. I'm ready to go right now.

29
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:22,949
Did I tweet? It's so good. I know it's so good. Okay, what's better? One's in the chat if Breath

30
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,709
of the Wild is better. Two in the chat if Wind Waker is better. What's better? What should I be

31
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:38,100
playing right now? If you had a choice right now, if the genie showed up and said, I will change it

32
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:54,699
to whatever. I will make him play Wind Waker right now. What a stupid wish. What a bad wish.

33
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,339
The genie is here. I will do whatever you ask. You have free wishes. Hey, this 37 year old man

34
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:10,329
child on the internet. Can you make him play Wind Waker, please? Yeah, Wind Waker. That's the one.

35
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:26,040
Make him do it. No, excuse me. I'm, I'm, I'm a man. I'm just, I'm a man. Sorry, I'm a man.

36
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:43,540
No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm a man. Okay, I just looked down and I'm hoping that I could. Okay,

37
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:55,100
so I don't, I don't have a Star Wars shirt on. I picked, I almost did. I looked down. I thought

38
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:14,199
I had a Star Wars shirt on. Not today. We're just standard default adult gray. Sorry, nothing on it.

39
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,899
Villain hair? Yeah, maybe a little. I, I, we gotta test something here because the way that you

40
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:27,290
capture, you know, I'm living with, I'm using technology from like 2013 still. And I know,

41
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,730
dude, just get like a professional capture card. I, it's never going to happen because that

42
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,540
requires me to have to go get like actually get one, but we need to do this. You ready?

43
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,620
And I was like, just get it on Amazon. But every time I do an Amazon order for anything,

44
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,860
I always, I think of like, okay, what do I want? And then two or three important things,

45
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:52,089
just never make it to the list ever. Uh, okay. So you got to tell me if this is matching up

46
00:07:52,089 --> 00:08:01,319
both webcam, audio, and on the screen. You ready? So tell me there's a delay. Go options,

47
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:10,100
ability controls. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

48
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:17,699
We good? So that means I got it right. All right. I got it right. You guys ready? Are you pumped?

49
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:29,180
This is a Sunday of Omega Gaming Weekend. All right. So this is the, I, I, yeah, I opened it

50
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,139
and I, I didn't watch the opening cuts thing because I don't care. So let's go. It was onto

51
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:41,240
the background. I was like, I had, I was going like this. Nice frames. What do you mean nice frames?

52
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:49,340
Is this game 30 FPS? Do I have something wrong? There's a bingo card going. I don't even want

53
00:08:49,340 --> 00:09:12,460
to see it. It's 30 FPS. Wait, what are you saying? This game is 30 FPS? Hey, Bloodborne's one of my

54
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:21,509
favorite games ever made. And that's 30 FPS. So quiet. I need two headphones with this shit.

55
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:29,860
There's no LPs. It will help guide you after your long slumber. That is a Sheikah Slate. Take it.

56
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:40,490
It will help you with the classic sound effects in it too. Oh, he's got it. Is that a Wii U?

57
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,480
Was this a Wii U game? What does it come out for? A mysterious tablet with a glowing center. You've

58
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:53,179
never seen this device before, and yet there's something familiar about it. Are there annoying

59
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:59,110
puzzles in this game? No, this is, this was on, this wasn't Wii U. This was a Switch release, right?

60
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,809
These all, all treasures? Wait, the chests? Well-worn trousers. These old trousers are

61
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:23,210
red bear in spots, but they're surprisingly comfortable. The legs are a bit too short though.

62
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:37,480
Okay. This gear? Okay. Nice. So what is that like Hearthstone card pack that I have for my,

63
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:46,440
what is that? Is that like the, the slate? All right. I got pants. I was even never played this

64
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,320
before. I don't play Zelda. I, I actually, this is the first Zelda game I played in probably

65
00:10:51,320 --> 00:11:05,080
15 years. Ooh, shirt. You can pick, wait, you can pick stuff up. Particle effects. Pretty good.

66
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:20,230
It's got physics. Pretty good. Do naked no armor run. Is this kind of like, um, all right, should

67
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:27,830
we make a, make a running counter of, try to do this without mentioning any From Software game?

68
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:33,899
How? I don't think I can do that.

69
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,159
That will show you the way. Don't ask chat for advice. LOL. The game is self-explanatory.

70
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:58,419
Okay. I'm not, I'm not looking over here. So that's how you, it's a key. I didn't make the title,

71
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:11,110
one of the mods did. It's pretty good though. I can't, I don't think I can delete it. No intro?

72
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,870
Um, well, I already saw it. It was, uh, did the thing that video games challenge.

73
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:26,309
You are the light, our light, that must shine upon Hyrule once again. Now go.

74
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:38,309
Uh, it did the thing that video games like to do where, and I hate this. I want a menu before

75
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:44,389
anything happens. Anything. I don't want an opening cut scene. I don't want a get into the game and

76
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:52,899
here's the tutorial, but you can't access the menu. I give me the menu immediately. Immediately.

77
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:57,940
Once I do my settings, it pops up, should call it, come up and be like, hey, do you give a shit

78
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,100
about doing your settings? Just hit B if you don't care. And then whatever, you can do that whole

79
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,580
thing out. But I want to change the gamma. I want to change the, uh, field of view. I want to change

80
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:17,909
the audio levels. I don't want to just see the opening cut scene. God, if I made a game, God,

81
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:22,500
it would be the best game ever made. It would sell a hundred fucking billion copies. It would be so

82
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,019
good. That would, yeah, that would be each person would, would, would own 10 copies of my game.

83
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:38,779
It's just so goddamn good. Jump is X. That's kind of weird. All right. B is sprint. I don't like

84
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:50,659
that. I want it to be, I want B to be jump. Okay. Hold on a second. This is a switch controller. I

85
00:13:50,659 --> 00:14:05,100
forgot. I'll fix it in a minute because this is a grip meter. Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

86
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:47,299
Wow. Okay. No, I'm not going to say it. I won't. Okay. If I make 10 Elden Ring references this

87
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:56,740
stream, then I have to eat a bug on camera. I'm not doing that. Do you guys remember the old fear

88
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:08,419
factor fucking whatever they were videos? What was going on? I can't even stand it eating fucking

89
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:16,360
like live insects. Like what the fuck? What are we doing? It was horrible. I couldn't take it.

90
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:27,210
Okay. Wooden branches such as these are pretty common. All right. Wait, I have a branch for a

91
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:38,980
weapon. Okay. Attack with your weapon. All right. That's kind of cool. Can I use the branch for the

92
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:53,899
whole game? Yeah, this is all fucked up. This is all fucked up. Hold on a second. Change jump button

93
00:15:53,980 --> 00:16:05,620
on. Wait, what? Oh, there we go. So now where, what is sprint? Sprint is X.

94
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:22,840
I think that's all right. Wait, I broke it already? I didn't even touch anything. Why is it already

95
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:40,379
broken? Mushrooms. Okay. You can eat these. You smashed it. What? Did I already ruin something?

96
00:16:40,379 --> 00:17:09,109
You're covering the map. Oh, I'll go like this then. Better. That's throw. Who needs a weapon? Fuck it.

97
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:16,970
How do you get another weapon? I don't actually need that, right? It's a...

98
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:33,660
Where's, where's that? Oh, okay. Oh, all right. And you can stamp too. Okay, cool. So I gotta go this

99
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:47,930
way. Cool. All right. Follow the Sheikah Slate. Baked apple. Beg your pardon. I do believe that is

100
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,490
my baked apple. You can't just go around taking whatever you please. Oh, forgive me. I could not

101
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,529
resist pulling your leg. Please help yourself. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, as they say,

102
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:05,670
don't they like? It's a succulent treat. Where are you? Me? I'm Ganondorf. You see, I'm gonna have a

103
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,509
fucking big Santa Claus beard on for the whole game and then I'm gonna take it off and at the end

104
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:15,910
you're gonna be fighting me as Ganon. I win. I'm just an old fool who's lived here alone for quite

105
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:23,849
some time. I'm not Ganondorf. Don't worry. What brings a bright-eyed young man here?

106
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:30,009
Answering a question with a question. That is fair enough. As I cannot imagine our reading to be a

107
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:34,950
simple coincidence, I shall tell you this is the Great Plateau. According to legend, this is the

108
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:45,180
birthplace of the entire Kingdom of Hyrule. Why do I look like this? Why did I read that? Of the

109
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:49,319
five million comments that were just coming through. Okay, cool. This is the birthplace of

110
00:18:49,319 --> 00:19:02,420
Hyrule. That's, no, it's gonna say Ganon's dad. He's his fucking Gondondorf. That temple there,

111
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,349
long ago, was the site of many sacred ceremonies. Ever since the decline of the kingdom a hundred

112
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:14,700
years ago, it has set abandoned in a state of decay. Yet another forgotten entity, a mere ghost

113
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:29,819
of its former self. Interesting. That's right. That'll be, that'll be five hundred dollars,

114
00:19:29,819 --> 00:19:33,500
because that was a cool magic trick and I didn't even ask you, I didn't even ask you for money.

115
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:43,319
That'll be a thousand dollars, please, for that kind of personal show. Oh, cool. Well,

116
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,140
then just help yourself to that torch there and how may I ask you planning to use it?

117
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,589
Um, it's a secret. To set things on fire, it's rather unnerving. Please be cautious with that

118
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:58,660
around any dry grass. You know, there are plenty of monsters in this area. That torch would make a

119
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,049
good weapon if need be. Don't just swing it around without purpose. You must face your opponents and

120
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:18,940
lock your sights on them. Yeah, right, obviously. Okay, I'm just testing it. Do I have to light it?

121
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:29,940
How do I light the torch? Okay, got it. Now what? Let's go. I'm holding this as if I don't know

122
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:36,099
what to do with this, right? This is like, this is like I don't know what to do with this item.

123
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:46,950
Wait, is this an axe? Woodcutter's axe. Oh, shit, cool. No, I don't want to put that on.

124
00:20:46,950 --> 00:21:12,740
Change weapon. Press and hold and then switch. This is a camera? How do I zoom out? Did I just

125
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:26,619
take a picture? Okay. Um, I got to go that way. How do I switch? It said hold what? How do I

126
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:36,150
switch weapons? I said hold this and then press. Oh, okay, there it is. Yeah. All right, I'm ready.

127
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:49,019
Let's move. Acorn. So you just wait. You just eat nuts and seeds and shit. 20 rupees under there.

128
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:29,529
Okay, cool. Let's move. I got him. Oh, is there a dodge roll? What the fuck? Is there a dodge roll?

129
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:48,579
Okay, got him. Is it jump? Bokoblin fang. Cook it alongside a critter to make it an elixir.

130
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:59,140
Wait, I cook their teeth? Okay, cool. Wasting durability on weak enemies. What do you mean

131
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:13,559
wasting durability? I don't know what that- what do you mean? How do I go to the- I mean wasting

132
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:19,190
durability. How can I see how much durability this has? Should I use the stick or something for now?

133
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:47,509
Wait, search. Ancient spring. Okay, cool. I get some more sticks? How do you block? Can I punch?

134
00:23:47,509 --> 00:24:14,700
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, he dropped a turkey leg. How long does it take to

135
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,259
break stuff? Should I actually not be using this? Look at this. This thing's sick. I'm gonna hold

136
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:28,579
onto the turkey leg. It depends. It doesn't take long. Is there a durability menu? Can I see which

137
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:33,079
one is low and high? Don't even- who cares? Don't even worry about it. All right, I'm just gonna

138
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:48,650
keep the axe on. How come the title says horsies, by the way? Is there a horse? Can you climb this?

139
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:24,380
I found a bird up here. Oh, I'm just stealing the eggs. He found his way. I mean, if this is- this

140
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:42,630
is just- hey, all right. So, I'm gonna push that over here and kill these guys. What happens when

141
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:59,980
you die? What was the last- what? What was the last save? Why did I just explode? They- do I still

142
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,539
have everything? No, I'm good. I'm good. Okay, that was fine. So, wait, this is my- do you have to

143
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:50,220
pick your body up? Hey, come get me. How do I- can I get their attention? I got hit by that, too.

144
00:26:52,619 --> 00:27:11,319
How did I get hit by that? Oh, a cooked turkey! Pick up souls? Where are they? I don't see them

145
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:36,650
anywhere. Are they actually on the ground? There's an X on the screen. Dude, I actually don't like it

146
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:42,940
like that. The sprint really needs to be- but no, it sucks that way. I don't like it like that.

147
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:54,259
I'll keep it the other way. I'll have to get used to it. Why can't I just map it? Okay, that's really

148
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:59,460
funny to me that there's a change the jump button rebind, but it just makes it a different one that

149
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,849
you can't determine what you want to do. You want to remap jump? Well, you can only make it this

150
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:32,650
other one button. Okay, let's go. Get a better PC. Ooh, okay, that's cool. What's this? I got a bow?

151
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:50,069
Okay, right trigger is bow. How do I fire? Is he throwing fucking rocks? All right,

152
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:58,779
there's tons of shit here. Oh, I didn't have any arrows. Arrows, horn. Very cool. All right.

153
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:25,160
Should I eat an apple or eat something? Tasty. No arrow, Andy. Good one, thanks. I appreciate it.

154
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:32,859
I was hoping at least one of you would care. Wait, hidden cave? No, I'm supposed to go here.

155
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:51,660
Okay, so cool. So this is the first little area. This is my first dungeon? First dungeon? Link,

156
00:29:51,660 --> 00:30:01,000
it's a rectangle the size of the device. Just put it in. You can rebind in the actual menu.

157
00:30:01,000 --> 00:31:01,180
Really? You can? That pig default noise. Oh shit. That's pretty, uh, that's pretty cool.

158
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:43,420
Great Plateau Tower. Distilling local information. Here it comes. Oh, it's nevermind. I'm not gonna

159
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:50,089
say it. I'm gonna have you guys keep track of the times I say it, but it is that thing

160
00:31:50,089 --> 00:32:33,799
from that other game that I played. Why didn't anybody wake me up? Now then, you must hurry,

161
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:47,720
Link, before it's too late. He doesn't care? Why are you even saying that? Mirrored cam?

162
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,259
No, it's not a mirrored cam. All right, so now I opened up that, which that's, okay, that's the

163
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,779
very end of the game, right? I have to go there. I have to dip the axe into the mountain to get the

164
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:05,940
encrusted fucking, like, Dairy Queen cherry dip on the axe, right? And then I gotta go over here

165
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,819
on the left and I have to mold the handle out of clay. The hardest clay that was put in the kiln

166
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:18,170
up here in the mountain of the ovens and stuff. And then, yeah, I'll be there eventually. I'll be

167
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:23,690
there eventually. That's how it worked in the other ones, right? Like, you have to go get this part

168
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,210
from the sword and go get this from over here and get this sword. I haven't played Zelda in fucking

169
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:37,740
15 years. I have no idea how it works. Don't you, like, make the master sword in all these games?

170
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Isn't that the whole point? I thought that's what the entire point of all these games was.

171
00:33:42,740 --> 00:34:20,420
It's like, oh, you have to get the master sword. We got that out of the way. That's right. Okay,

172
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:41,960
how do I get down from here? Can I go faster than this? Can you, how do you climb faster?

173
00:34:41,960 --> 00:35:06,550
Okay, this tower and others just like it have erupted across the land one after another.

174
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:12,699
It's almost as though a long dormant power has awoken quite suddenly. You do not mind me asking,

175
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:21,050
did anything odd occur while you were atop that tower? I'm revealing no information. I saw the

176
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:27,340
whole thing. You don't have to hide it from me. Well, why ask the question then? Although I could

177
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,059
not hear anything, I did see you react as if you heard something coming from the direction of the

178
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:46,300
castle. Okay. Did you recognize this voice? Let's see if you can go two for two. Seems to have some

179
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:52,809
work to do as far as earning your trust goes. I suppose that is understandable. I assume you

180
00:35:52,809 --> 00:36:01,659
caught sight of that atrocity enshrouding the castle. That is calamity Ganon. 100 years ago,

181
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:10,860
that vile entity brought the kingdom of Hyrule to ruin. It appeared suddenly and destroyed

182
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,780
everything in its path. So many innocent lives were lost in its wake. For a century, the very

183
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:23,349
symbol of our kingdom, Hyrule Castle, has managed to contain that evil, but just barely. There it

184
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,590
festers, building its strength for the moment. It will unleash its blight upon the land once again.

185
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:42,460
It would appear that moment is fast approaching. Do you intend to make your way to the castle?

186
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:51,849
I do. Had a feeling you would say that. Here on this isolated plateau, we are surrounded on all

187
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:58,329
sides by steep cliffs with no way down. If you were to try to jump off, well, no death could be

188
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:04,469
more certain or more foolish. Of course, if you had a paraglider like mine, that would be another

189
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:10,949
story. Give me it. Certainly, why not? But there is no such thing as a free item in this world,

190
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:15,750
you know. Let's see now. How about I trade it for a bit of treasure that slumbers nearby?

191
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:33,420
So you get quests and stuff? Okay, cool. Yeah, let's track this one. Let me show you something.

192
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:58,250
I didn't know I think that. I was seeing... Okay, well, oops. I'm following you. You said,

193
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:08,469
follow me. I'm following you. You see that structure, the one shining with a strange light?

194
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:14,489
Yeah, it began glowing at the exact moment these towers rose up from the ground. It must be a

195
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:27,780
dungeon. Okay, I would think such a place might house some sort of treasure. All right, let's go.

196
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:41,050
Fair exchange for the paraglider. Oh, you can swim. Okay, cool. Does everything break or anything?

197
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:56,889
I just caught a fish in my mouth. What? I thought that was... Wait, hold on.

198
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:04,889
Oh, my God. I'm all right. I'm okay. I'll be all right. I just drowned in a three-foot deep

199
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:15,130
pool. I'm sorry. I thought that was just like, okay... I didn't know that was breath. I get it

200
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:21,289
now. I get it. I get it. I get it. I thought that was my stamina and then when it was empty,

201
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:35,210
I was going to start, I don't know, getting hurt or... I don't know. I didn't know. How was

202
00:39:35,210 --> 00:40:27,059
I supposed to know? I'm going that way. 1240... Is that real time? This is pretty. I can't move

203
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:43,639
that rock. Treasure down here. Raid song? I mean, raid song. How do I open this? Oh, there's a raid.

204
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,170
Hey, the grapefruit. Thanks for the raid. Is there... That was a raid? That just happened?

205
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,369
I'm not going to fucking drown in here. I'm dead again. I'm dead. I'm actually going to die in this.

206
00:40:54,619 --> 00:41:01,880
Oh, my God. Thank goodness. You can't swim to treasure. It's its own puzzle. Oh, okay. So,

207
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:19,980
let's figure that out. Do I have to drain the water? Power fire? Wait, I think I know what to do.

208
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:40,630
Can I shove this in and like, displace some water? I don't know. There's no lever to pull,

209
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:59,619
whatever. I can probably do it later. Okay, so here we go. Let's do it. Play the game?

210
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:11,639
How am I not playing the game? Access granted. This seems kind of fun. Maybe I will enjoy this.

211
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:30,039
Solving puzzles is a big part of the game. Don't let chat ruin it for you unless you're stuck.

212
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:47,219
Okay. To you, who sets foot in this shrine, I am Oman Ao. In the name of... Why did I want

213
00:42:47,219 --> 00:43:14,900
to press A? Is this temperature? What? There's a degrees temperature? All right, let's do it.

214
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:28,840
It's engine oil temp. No help. No help. Play Disney Infinity 3.0. I tried to two days ago,

215
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,659
and it didn't work. I couldn't capture it and I could barely play it. They just, like I said,

216
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:42,340
they just dragged the console port folder over to Unity or something to make it just run. I don't

217
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:50,460
even know. I have no idea. It's one of those ports. Manipulate metallic objects using magnetism.

218
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,300
Grab onto metallic objects using the magnetic energy that pours forth from the magnesis ruin.

219
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:44,579
Okay, so I can control magnetic powers? That's kind of cool. Push. Oh, cool. So you've done those

220
00:44:44,579 --> 00:45:45,190
special powers? All right, I got it. Is the treasure chest up there? Cool. Okay, I know how

221
00:45:45,190 --> 00:46:16,179
to get that. Oh, I can't just pick it up? Oh, push. Okay. Can I make like a bridge? I guess not.

222
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:46,260
Maybe I can make a bridge. What happened? What the fuck was that? What was that? I snapped my neck.

223
00:46:46,260 --> 00:47:04,840
Oh, I started at the very beginning. What? You slammed a metal slab directly into your face.

224
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:32,219
There's like a hop, isn't there? There's always a hop in the Zelda games. There's like a hop, hop,

225
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:53,750
hop. How do I do it? How do I do the hop? Ancient screw. No, it's not the jump. It's like a

226
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:59,659
they usually there's a bloodborne dash. You guys know what I'm talking about, right?

227
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:06,309
Doesn't he do like a backflip? There's like a flip, flip, flip. Is that just not in this game?

228
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:14,300
Hold, target, and jump. Yeah, but it's not doing it. You learn that later. Okay,

229
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:40,230
I wonder how close I am to actually getting that because I want it. I can probably jump up here.

230
00:48:40,230 --> 00:49:12,250
I can't tilt this. Oh shit. Okay, cool. Oh, it's made out of metal. That's right. Traveller's bow.

231
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:45,780
All right, change bow. I'll keep this one on. All right, that's fun. What else? You seriously

232
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:58,230
suck at this game. Dude, I don't, I've just started playing it. You've proven to possess

233
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:08,920
the resolve of a true hero. I am Omen Ao, the creator of this trial. I am a humble monk,

234
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,920
blessed with the sight of goddess Hylia and dedicated to helping those who seek defeated

235
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:24,940
Ganon. With your arrival, my duty is now fulfilled. In the name of goddess Hylia, allow me to bestow

236
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:39,929
this gift upon you, the varnish for the master sword. Can't use it yet though. Spirit orb,

237
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:56,150
a symbol of courage given to those who have overcome the challenges of a shrine. So what is

238
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,210
it? Is it like a currency thing? And I mean that actually, not like the joke from like five years

239
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:28,469
ago. Cool. All right. So you beat, beat shrines, get currency, get money, get experience. It's a

240
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:40,679
soul coin. Ooh. I'll be really honest. To be able to come from that direction and land here,

241
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:47,340
you had to have jumped from like all the way up there. You know, you had to have left 20 minutes

242
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:54,780
ago and started gliding down here. How would you know that I was going to be done by whatever?

243
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:00,699
Okay. Where's the paraglider? I encourage you to slow down for a moment, my courageous friend.

244
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:07,659
The appearance of those towers in the awakening of the shrine is all connected to that Sheikah

245
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:14,809
slate you carry on your hip there. What do you mean? Well, it's been quite some time since I have

246
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:21,289
seen that Sheikah slate long ago. Highly advanced tribe known as the Sheikah inhabited these lands.

247
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:26,489
The great power of their wisdom saved this kingdom time and time again, but their ancient

248
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:32,710
technology disappeared long ago. Or so it is said. It's interesting, however, to think how

249
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:38,679
something like that survived all this time hidden away in a shrine. These shrines are tucked away in

250
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:46,579
numerous places across the land. On this plateau alone, I believe there are three. Three. Bring me

251
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:51,829
the treasure from each of these shrines and I will give you my paraglider. That was not the deal.

252
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:58,519
Oh, well, I suppose I changed my mind. I'm sure that won't be a problem for a young go-getter

253
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:06,679
like you. I'll also teach you a trick for finding shrines. It's always best to survey the area by

254
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:10,360
looking around from a high point. Let's see here. How about you make your way to the top of that

255
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:19,769
tower again? Really? I was just up there. That didn't even stick. I didn't get anything on me.

256
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:35,639
You know what I mean? That didn't even apply. Okay. Take a look at the map on your Sheikah slate.

257
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:40,840
Take a look. I sent you a friend request on Pokemon Go. It was a few days ago and

258
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:46,099
now you don't have no pressure, but I mean, I think we could really find some monsters together.

259
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:51,800
Okay. See those blue icons? You should recognize the cave where you woke, the shrine where you

260
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:59,849
came from in the tower. Travel instantly to any of those places with the Sheikah slate.

261
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:17,510
Fix that one strand of hair. All right. So let's go back up here. Wait, I need to figure out this

262
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:41,449
lake puzzle, right? If everything's a little puzzle, then I have to figure it out. Oh,

263
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:50,630
shit. Cool. I can chop down trees. What's that? All right. The way there's something interesting

264
00:54:50,630 --> 00:55:19,050
here. Is this poisonous? No, but it apparently is quicksand. Wait a minute. I have this. Wait,

265
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:22,730
I can, can I pull the treasures from under the, hold on a second. I think I got it.

266
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:34,199
Those are not treasures. I can't, I can't grab those and not made it a metal.

267
00:55:34,840 --> 00:56:44,650
It is very clearly a jump here. What are the, what are the metal? Is it a metal? Dude, go back.

268
00:56:44,650 --> 00:57:22,710
I'm, I'm just surveying the area. What is that? Let them explore there. Okay. Sorry. I didn't,

269
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,710
I didn't. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I didn't know what this was attached to. All right.

270
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:47,289
What do I do about this? All the way I have to put it inside. You fucking piece of shit.

271
00:57:57,219 --> 00:58:10,650
Do I have to put the, like score it like a basket? Yeah. Haha. You found me. You're not

272
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:16,409
Hestu, but you can see me. I didn't know your kind could see the children in the forest.

273
00:58:19,159 --> 00:59:07,590
Give this to Hestu. A Korok seed. Okay. No, I want to be able to pick up the item he dropped.

274
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:43,690
Oh my God. Whatever. Can I, do I have to come back here? Why is this blinking? Why is this

275
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,739
blinking? It's like, it's like blink, blink, blink. Like come over here. Blink, blink, blink.

276
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:58,019
Do something here. What is it telling me? Well, those are the arrows. I, okay. Whatever. I'll be,

277
00:59:58,019 --> 01:00:10,199
I'll come back later. Fuck it. They're your arrows. Well, I didn't know that they blinked.

278
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:37,579
This game is cool. I like it. What's the height for fall damage? Is it bad? I don't know. I'm

279
01:00:37,579 --> 01:01:30,679
just going to see. Like, can I, is it, how far, how high is it? Almost there. Oh, okay. Thank you.

280
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:56,090
Thank you. I think I've had to sneeze. Okay. I'm glad I got that out. That's been sitting there

281
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:03,530
for the last 45 minutes. I swear to God. Okay. You certainly took your time. Did you forget how to

282
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:15,300
fast travel? Yes, I did. Now then I want you to join me up here so you can look at,

283
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:34,630
out there to find another. I already see it. The scope. Oh, that's what I saw before with that.

284
01:02:34,630 --> 01:03:07,239
Look, it's over there. Uh, no, I got it. Wait. Oh, finding the shrines more than one. Okay.

285
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:22,739
Wait, take those pins away. There's way too many. How do I get rid of them? I'm doing an orbital

286
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:29,590
strike on that place. Uh, I want to put, whatever. There's three, right? How do I take them down?

287
01:03:29,590 --> 01:04:00,619
So now there's one more, he said. One, two. Did I already get that one? Did I already get this one?

288
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:16,119
I got them, right? The ones you finished turn blue. Okay. So then there's three. Isn't that what he

289
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:46,969
said? To find three of them? Or three more. Oh, just go to them. Okay. So which, this one's on

290
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:56,599
the ground level. I'm doing this one first. I like this one. I like this. This is cool.

291
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:27,500
Should I check? I'm going to investigate this camp. Do you have to sleep or anything?

292
01:05:27,500 --> 01:06:07,750
Oh, an arm. Comes back to life. How do you, how do you permanently kill these? These things are

293
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:17,639
five? The woodcutter's axe is dog shit in comparison. All right. I'm going to keep this for now.

294
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,500
All right. I'm going to, let me invest. Wait, is there a way to put a food on your quick bar or

295
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:51,380
something? Completely fucking missed. All right. Whatever. This thing's already, I touched one thing

296
01:06:51,380 --> 01:07:08,170
with it. It's a, what does it, why does it just explode? Somebody, what happened in there? Okay.

297
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:15,559
I guess I'm going to just loot your whole place. Somebody, somebody really fucked up in here.

298
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:52,070
God damn it. Just scared the shit out of me. Okay. Cool. So you can only carry a certain amount of

299
01:07:52,070 --> 01:08:13,289
things. Let's put the, let's put the club on. I feel like I don't want to eat a lot of this stuff.

300
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:33,750
How much is it? Do you get for this? Spiked club. So what was actually in here? You hold right D pad.

301
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:45,529
You can switch between. All right. That, thank you so much. What do we got? Fire arrows. Cool. Got it.

302
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:59,659
It was the weirdest way I could have possibly done that. All right. That was cool. A little dungeon,

303
01:08:59,659 --> 01:09:23,020
a little dungeon. What should we do now that hell has frozen over? Um, I don't know. Oh,

304
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:28,550
you can probably activate those. And that is a map reveal. What's up there? All right. I like this

305
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:57,930
game. I like this game. I didn't say anything else. Everyone hold off. Okay. I can, I can grab those.

306
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:09,689
I got to go back to that other shrine. Amber. It's been valued as a component in decorations

307
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:45,109
and crafting since ancient times. Cool. And the shrines right here, right? Get away from me.

308
01:10:46,069 --> 01:11:20,979
What is the dodge? There has to be a dodge. Why? Because games with two frame invincibility

309
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:26,100
dodge rolls are my favorites. So I want it to be in everything. All right. I get it. I'm going to,

310
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:40,340
I'm going to hide behind something in the ruins and be fine. Ready? Watch this. Jesus.

311
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:22,460
You can't outrun it. I was seeing if you could outrun it with a sprint. I was seeing if you're

312
01:12:22,460 --> 01:13:25,079
going to run with the sprints. Relax. Crouch. I need a weapon so I can outrun it. No, I cannot

313
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:40,199
actually. Stop telling me I can outrun it. I'm going to use my bow. Yeah, bro. You can. I can.

314
01:13:40,199 --> 01:14:33,449
No, you cannot. How do I put the bow down? What? Why can I hurt this? Everything's breaking.

315
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:47,619
I shoot it in like the neck. Oh shit. It's emote only. I actually don't know what I in the head.

316
01:14:48,420 --> 01:15:14,920
My bow is gone. What was that for? Um, where's the bow? No, don't throw this. How do I put this down?

317
01:15:16,569 --> 01:15:24,550
How do you quick equip the bow? I have a second bow. How do I equip a bow quickly?

318
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:58,140
Does it have like a thing on its head? Can I climb it? I can't hurt this. I think,

319
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:32,329
do I have to shoot it in its neck? Is that working? It's not working. I don't think I can kill

320
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:38,659
this. I have to like go pick up a fucking heavy box and throw it at it. I don't get it. Shoot it

321
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:51,689
in the eye. I am. I have no air. I cannot fight this thing. I don't have, I'm definitely, I don't

322
01:16:51,689 --> 01:17:09,000
have an item that I need to kill this. Yeah. I need the ancient gear to make the ancient gear

323
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:47,449
arrow to shoot it in the eye with the ancient gear arrow tip. I put this into the coin slot.

324
01:17:47,449 --> 01:17:53,029
All right. I actually don't know what the fuck to do. What about shooting the ears?

325
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:01,220
I think I just have to shoot it there. I actually think I just keep doing this over and over again.

326
01:18:14,859 --> 01:18:25,560
No, that's wrong. Nay, nay, nay. Okay. So is there something else here I can do?

327
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:42,090
Wait, is there something? Can I crush it? No, no, no, no. Wait. Okay. Should I just leave?

328
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:56,250
Am I missing a very specific item that I need to kill this? Nay, nay. Yeah. Yeah. It's yeah. I'm

329
01:18:56,250 --> 01:19:20,739
telling you that I picked up the gear. All right. I'm out of here. Okay. The judge by shrine. This

330
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:44,100
game is pretty sick. I love breath of the wild. Cool. I hope I like it as much as you do. You

331
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:58,460
should play sonic adventure. Didn't I already play sonic adventure on stream long time ago

332
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:12,979
during a dream cast night or dream cast week, whatever it was. Okay. Second shrine. Yeah, I did.

333
01:20:12,979 --> 01:20:29,369
In the name of the goddess Hylia, I offer this trial bomb trial. All right, let's turn it on.

334
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:46,659
Can you just make this the new Elden ring where you play it every single stream? I don't know.

335
01:20:46,659 --> 01:21:06,890
We'll see. Do I see if I like it? I have to enjoy it for a while. Whoa. Okay. The force of the blast

336
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:18,869
can be used to damage monsters or destroy objects. I wonder what I do with that now. Okay. They're

337
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:24,970
both round and cube bombs. We use whatever was better for the situation. Okay. So I go take that

338
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:44,680
back outside and I just throw bombs at that thing and blow its head off. Got you. So it's just a

339
01:21:44,680 --> 01:22:10,279
cool down. It's not, there's no mana. Just cool down. Cool. Oh, okay. I have to detonate them.

340
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:22,199
Ooh, it's in here. Pretty great. All right. I'm never going to use that. Your inventory is full.

341
01:22:22,199 --> 01:22:53,239
What? I was getting rid of it. Damn. This thing's cool. All right. Put this away. I'm probably never

342
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:59,300
going to equip this for the rest of the entire playthrough. I'm going to run into so many problems

343
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:06,119
with this. Uh, the, this game system where things break, I will never use a good weapon until like

344
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:28,619
the last boss and I'll cycle through five of them. Anything down here? This is too complicated. I

345
01:23:28,619 --> 01:24:04,069
quit. I can't climb this. No, I cannot climb smooth surfaces. Sound design of the game is really nice.

346
01:24:04,069 --> 01:25:53,699
It does sound really good. It is a very nice sound. Okay. I think I did it. Can I get launched from

347
01:25:53,699 --> 01:26:02,659
these? Well, that's fun. I can. So hold on. I'm not going to do that. I want to get launched from

348
01:26:02,659 --> 01:26:13,260
that one. Yeah, I know. I'm getting the chest. I want to make sure they didn't kill you instantly

349
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:25,380
or something. Just like you're dead. I was hoping it would. I was trying to time it.

350
01:26:44,390 --> 01:27:01,560
Amber. Okay, cool. Now I've take this and I probably put it into something over here, right?

351
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:26,460
I guess not. Your resourcefulness in overcoming this trial speaks to the promise of a hero.

352
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:35,899
In the name of goddess Hylia, I bestow upon you the spirit orb. That wasn't not that hard.

353
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:45,779
The fact that nobody has stumbled in here and done this simple pick the ball up puzzle. This is

354
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:53,239
a, this place is full of fucking idiots and no one's come down here and done that.

355
01:27:53,239 --> 01:28:01,420
Oh, the ancient trial where it's only the truest of heroes can pick a ball up and put it next to

356
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:10,090
this thing to blow up. That's really not that hard. It wasn't activated till you touch the tower.

357
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:18,279
You need the tablet. All right, but why make it so easy for me, right? If like,

358
01:28:18,279 --> 01:28:23,319
if you need the tablet to come in here, shouldn't don't they want to have some barrier

359
01:28:23,319 --> 01:28:26,600
and make sure that the hero can actually do shit and not just have it be a simple

360
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,520
pick the ball up puzzle? If you want to make sure this guy's got what it takes,

361
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:36,329
you put a, you, you, you put like a Griffin in one of these, then you'll find somebody that you

362
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:42,859
can fucking really deal with again. You put like a fucking Hydra in one, in one of these and have it

363
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:52,140
be a wall of Sudokus before you get to that point. You want the real hero? I'm talking a mural of

364
01:28:52,140 --> 01:29:04,140
Sudokus. Eventually someone might be able to do it. You know how many heroes would go down to the

365
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:08,859
wall of Sudokus? There's like 5,000 Sudokus and just be like, I'm not gonna open this. I'm out of

366
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:33,210
here. Is that working? All right. Well, I did that one. So I should clear that section. Is this

367
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:46,859
hurting? I don't think it's hurt. Okay. Let me get out of here. So I did that. That's good.

368
01:29:48,869 --> 01:30:10,649
Now let's head this way. Ooh, give me this. Very cool. This is a Nintendo switch shirt.

369
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:15,989
You just pulled me out of the game. So bad. I'm now out of the game. I've now, this is, I'm,

370
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:19,750
I'm going to like a Zelda convention now. This is no longer breath of the wild. What happened?

371
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:52,180
You pulled me out. I'm a gamer now. I'm going up. We're that way. Probably. It's too bad.

372
01:30:52,180 --> 01:31:18,149
There's not an emo where you can just be like, what was up in these trees? Nothing. Flowers?

373
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:36,520
Nothing. Which one's closer? This one or this one? Oh, this one by far is closer. How do I get up

374
01:31:36,520 --> 01:32:42,470
there? Yeah. I can't care anymore. Are there bees? Oh shit. Oh, yeah. Can I get it? Give me that

375
01:32:42,470 --> 01:33:30,840
quick. What's the agro range? Okay. We're good. All right. How do I get up there? All right. Well,

376
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:50,310
there's the old man. It's a pear. Spicy pepper. Ooh, old man's diary. Don't, this is kind of

377
01:33:50,310 --> 01:34:01,739
fucked up. Should I read this? Spicy meat and seafood fry. Not only restores health,

378
01:34:01,739 --> 01:34:13,140
but also keeps me warm even when traveling in the snowy mountains. Okay. I forgot to write down a

379
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:18,869
very important recipe. I know it contained raw meat and spicy pepper. However, I can't remember

380
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:25,050
what else I used. Sadly, on this lonely plateau, I have only my known knowledge and memory to rely

381
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:29,670
on. If I did find someone who knew the missing ingredient, I would happily reward them with my

382
01:34:29,670 --> 01:35:24,649
warm doublet. Okay. Shield! You can pass time by a fire. Uh, let me talk to you. Ooh, fancy that. We

383
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:29,750
meet again. This body of mine isn't what it used to be. Recovering from bout of hard work takes a

384
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:36,250
while. If you're hungry, I have an empty pot you can use to cook yourself a meal. Open your inventory,

385
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:40,119
grab hold of your ingredients, and toss them in. Try to consider how the ingredients will

386
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:55,829
complement one another. You can even make a dish that increases your stamina. Sick. Oh, food. Wait,

387
01:35:55,829 --> 01:36:11,510
how do you cook? You have to hold it? Hold. Hold? Hold, hold, hold. Oh, oh, oh, I see what you mean.

388
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:32,260
Okay, what about like a mushroom? You want some cooked fucking poisonous mushrooms? And, ooh! Oh,

389
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:47,300
shit! Okay. What about a cooked acorn and fish souffle? Fish? Wait, hold on. Two fishes, an egg,

390
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:53,609
and spicy peppers, and some fucking honey. How does that sound? That sounds like a pretty good

391
01:36:53,609 --> 01:37:25,159
batch to me. Glazed seafood, bro! How about some rubies for crunch? Uh, gear, a bat wing, and like

392
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:45,850
a fucking monster eye. Dude, did I, what? Did I just actually make a special food? Go make grass

393
01:37:45,850 --> 01:37:54,390
and shit? Wait, you can cook grass? All right, what about an egg? Egg, acorn, spicy pepper, and

394
01:37:55,960 --> 01:38:17,880
ancient screw. Wait, like, why can I cook that? All right, um, you can do that? That's so stupid.

395
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:24,229
That wasn't an important item or anything, right? Was that actually, that was not like

396
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:41,289
an important thing I need, is it? Eat it. No? Okay, good. Thank God. Okay, if they added a puke,

397
01:38:41,289 --> 01:38:45,340
this would be a full letter grade higher. If I came out of the menu and he just went,

398
01:38:46,699 --> 01:38:55,079
just green sludge came out of his mouth. All right, well, that's cool. You can just make recipes?

399
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:27,029
Really? Whoa! Apple tree right here. Look at all these apples up here. Well, I'm gonna make like

400
01:39:27,029 --> 01:39:40,489
an apple pie. The cooking part's my favorite thing. I don't want to cut this down. Is there

401
01:39:40,489 --> 01:39:55,619
a seed? I actually did not really want to cut that down. What if I did apple and wood, you know,

402
01:39:55,619 --> 01:40:21,770
for crunch? How much wood should I get? I feel like I should do this now so I don't do this later.

403
01:40:22,489 --> 01:40:58,180
Leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf. I mean leaf. Leaf, leaf, leaf. Oh, um, whoa! All right, don't,

404
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:35,319
I don't want to use that. I'll make an apple pie or something. Spicy apple mushroom pie. Ooh,

405
01:41:35,319 --> 01:41:40,380
grants low level cold resistance. The sweet dish is made by heaping tasty fruits into a pan and

406
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:49,579
simmering until tender. I get four and a half minutes of, uh, cold resist. That is by far the

407
01:41:49,579 --> 01:41:54,920
most fun part of the game so far, without a doubt. That's awesome. That's really fun to do.

408
01:41:55,720 --> 01:42:08,229
The fact you can make your own recipes, that's death. Okay, so how do I get across here? Good

409
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:36,390
question. Up there and then left. Tree, tree, tree. Climb the tree or knock the tree down.

410
01:42:52,409 --> 01:43:07,180
Can you actually climb this whole thing? I'm mainly curious about that. Can you get to the top?

411
01:43:07,739 --> 01:43:42,630
Can I, can I go up and like put my legs up like Spider-Man? Okay, I made it. Okay, so you cannot

412
01:43:42,630 --> 01:44:01,960
get there from that. You, uh, you probably just chop it down. What was it? Hold. Oh, right. That

413
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:20,920
didn't work either. What the fuck? What? That didn't work. Cut the other one. You guys are

414
01:44:20,920 --> 01:45:24,569
fucking with me. Oh, fuck off. All right. What's the, it's holding. What button do you hold to,

415
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:38,699
I don't know. It's hold, hold this shit. Hold that shit. Hold right. Okay. It's hold right.

416
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:53,720
What's this? Ooh, a spear. Explain. I know it's a hold right and then press the right stick and then

417
01:45:53,720 --> 01:46:00,439
let go. And I, I, I know, I know it's contextual pressed, pulled button key mapping. Where's my

418
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:30,180
food? Boomer reflexes. There's way more than four buttons in this. You know how I feel about it.

419
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:57,939
Okay. Can I climb up here? I might be able to climb this scared the fuck out of me. All right.

420
01:46:57,939 --> 01:47:10,710
Um, I don't think I can climb that. I want to get all these apples though. Emote only. Yeah.

421
01:47:10,710 --> 01:47:21,779
The emote only only makes it so I can't see all the back seaters. Just give me the fuck. I want

422
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:32,760
all the apples. Give them. I want them. Give them to me. Too lazy to climb to the right spot.

423
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:43,420
So I just cut the whole tree down. Okay. So then over here. Ah, I can climb that.

424
01:47:46,090 --> 01:48:09,050
Okay. Ooh, there's purple mushrooms over here. What are these? Rush room. Oh,

425
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:13,529
raggy. There's a rush room over here. A mushroom that can almost grow anywhere.

426
01:48:13,529 --> 01:48:38,390
Cook it before eating to temporarily increase your movement speed. Okay. A lot of, a lot of rush

427
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:49,539
rooms over here. I'll check this out. It's why I just blew up my face. Oh my God, dude,

428
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:58,199
this is going to be fucking awesome. Check this out. I'm going to hit this person in the fucking

429
01:48:58,199 --> 01:49:24,380
head. Oh, there's no arrows. Whatever. Can you craft arrows? Hop left for bow. Oh shit. Don't

430
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:43,270
jump again. Oh, close. All right. This is over here. And okay. I got to go to the right here.

431
01:49:43,270 --> 01:50:00,020
What the hell is that? I'm going to put somebody going to throw a rock over here. No one's going

432
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:30,789
to come step on my fingers when I get to the top. I think I'm good. Something died up here. All

433
01:50:30,789 --> 01:51:01,399
right. Oh, I die. I'm trying. Let's do it. This game's sick. He's doing it. But I'm playing it.

434
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:17,850
I bet you he's never going to play this again. Don't be so sure who sets foot in this shrine.

435
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:36,390
I am Oh, I die. I am in the name of the goddess Hylia. I offer you this trial stealing rune.

436
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:45,960
Now what if I just leaned over and opened my mouth and caught that in my mouth? Would that ruin

437
01:51:45,960 --> 01:52:01,819
everything? Would I have blue diarrhea for a year? Stop the flow of time for an object.

438
01:52:01,819 --> 01:52:06,010
I'm out of the loop. Is this your first playthrough? I've never played this. This is

439
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:17,029
my first Zelda game in 15 years. It's got to be 15 to 17, 18. When did Majora's Mask come out

440
01:52:17,029 --> 01:52:29,220
in Ocarina of Time? That was like 1996. We're talking about like 17 years. It's been a long

441
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:47,319
fucking time. Okay. So it's time stop. How long ago was it? Majora's Mask was 22 years ago? Oh

442
01:52:47,319 --> 01:53:01,960
my God. All right. So obviously we're going to go like this. Wait, how long is it? I'm trying to,

443
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:08,520
whatever. I'm, I'm, I'm holding jump to grab, but that's not how you do it. It's not hold,

444
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:14,010
jump, grab. It's hold, jump, and you have to hold X. You have to, there's like a grab button you

445
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:56,470
have to press. Ah, cool down. Chest or anything? You should name your horse shit stain. So there's

446
01:53:56,470 --> 01:54:06,220
a horse in the game. I didn't know that until you just said it. That looks cool. Iron sledgehammer.

447
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:15,659
Oh my fucking God. I don't know. What did I just drop? What did I just drop? All right.

448
01:54:15,659 --> 01:54:23,939
Throw this thing away. Wait, let me see what the moveset is like. This thing's awesome. I

449
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:57,180
don't have room for it. Torch. Should I hold onto the torch? Okay. I want that. Yep. Sledgehammers

450
01:54:57,180 --> 01:55:15,939
are very important. You'll want one at all times. Okay. It reminds me of this, the Wario where the

451
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:20,039
Dun-dun-dun-dun....

452
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:32,300
That's like din-din-din-din-dun-din-dun-din-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

453
01:55:32,619 --> 01:56:23,449
Can I move it? Uh, will the, will this work? Why would that work?

454
01:56:23,449 --> 01:56:27,609
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

455
01:56:27,609 --> 01:57:11,880
Spirit orb? Three spirit orbs. Okay, I got one more tutorial shrine to do. Go back and read

456
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:21,770
the tutorials? If I need to, I will. All right, there's only one remaining and it's up there.

457
01:57:21,770 --> 01:58:10,340
The temperature is getting diversely low. Find of find warm. How many? How many clothes that guy that's gonna help this? He's shrunk

458
01:58:11,859 --> 01:58:21,029
The temperature the temperature when it reaches a certain level. Well, how do I get the fuck out of here?

459
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:48,119
Where's the hot spot? Come on. So it's too cold. I wait I have food

460
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:53,880
Okay grants a low level cold resistance. The sweet dish is made of okay

461
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:59,960
So I got four and a half minutes if I eat this then I have about five minutes to walk around, right?

462
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:05,210
Let's go for it. I'll try to get there as quick as possible

463
01:59:05,449 --> 01:59:22,920
So if I eat it not yet wait till it I get to the temperature drop. Okay temperature dropped

464
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:31,590
Okay, eat the food here. Eat it cold resistance. Let's go

465
01:59:40,939 --> 01:59:48,869
I apparently got lost going to the nintendo convention. How did I end up here? Oh shit. Do I have a bow?

466
02:00:05,029 --> 02:00:26,680
Okay, I got it. I did it. I'm fine. What was even over here? There's nothing even here. Oh wait chest

Wait, I have an idea. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

471
02:02:02,069 --> 02:02:24,409
I think I can't just sit up there and god just get up there. I can't stand on this looks like I can

472
02:02:24,810 --> 02:02:37,109
All right, let's go

473
02:02:37,109 --> 02:02:57,539
All right. I made it. Okay, it's right over there. I think is this freezing. How cold is this water?

474
02:02:57,619 --> 02:03:20,779
Okay, well we're going a different way. Why do you only have three health?

475
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:30,630
I don't know because I just started the game. It looks like this is a bridge or something right here

476
02:03:30,630 --> 02:03:39,020
What is this line on the map? See this? What what is this? Oh, that's the waterfall edge

477
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:57,109
Um, shit. What do I do? I have one minute. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait. I think I can maybe can I get up this?

478
02:04:06,729 --> 02:04:41,800
I got one minute

479
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:50,409
Wait mushroom second, how do I cook? How do I cook food? Oh my god. I got this is no way

480
02:04:50,649 --> 02:05:32,020
I can I can eat my way there though. Am I good? I can eat my way here. Are you kidding me guys?

481
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:53,430
I don't why don't have a weapon equipped. I gotta make quick work of this

482
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:15,300
Oh look look at the my temperature. My temperature is good. Take what is it? Oh, let's take that

483
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:32,579
Oh my god, take arrows. Is this food or anything? It is very cool. All right. Should I cook? All right two apples

One mushroom one rush room and a acorn toasty rush room roast. Oh, it's not

485
02:07:07,189 --> 02:07:19,260
I just toasted everything. All right. Well, I didn't know I thought you could cook. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait

486
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:21,260
Wait, if I light up this

487
02:07:23,529 --> 02:07:52,600
The temperature's okay. I'm good. I get it. No, don't do that. No, I can't get it

488
02:07:52,600 --> 02:08:03,640
All right. I hurry up get in here. Is it warm in here? It's got to be insulated in here, right?

489
02:08:04,039 --> 02:08:39,539
I would imagine it's probably insulated. The temperature is

490
02:08:40,810 --> 02:08:46,010
To you sets foot in the shrine. I am khan namut in the name of the goddess halei after this trial

491
02:08:47,140 --> 02:09:20,739
Yeah, it's insulated insulated and it is not the oh wait pillar of ice from a water surface

492
02:09:20,979 --> 02:09:28,270
Builds ice pillars that are very stable. These pillars can be used as stepping stones or as obstacles use cryonis

493
02:09:28,729 --> 02:09:49,819
On an ice pillar to break it. That's a cool ability. Let's try it. Cool. So these how long do they last?

494
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:56,739
Can you only have one? Okay, you can have more than one

495
02:09:58,460 --> 02:10:04,979
I love that sound

496
02:10:04,979 --> 02:10:08,569
I love ice

497
02:10:08,569 --> 02:10:12,779
You know, it's my favorite one of my favorite things in the world when you get an ice tray

498
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,779
so I like to make my own ice and

499
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:18,020
the thick

500
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:21,539
It takes like a whole day to freeze this in the freezer

501
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:30,329
But when you get those huge they're at least two inches tall and two inches wide almost they're these big

502
02:10:31,659 --> 02:10:35,319
It's completely see-through thick ice chunks

503
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:40,859
I love just sitting that in a cup and just putting I don't know like ice tea in there

504
02:10:41,689 --> 02:11:15,210
Like a coca-cola or something. Oh, how high can I make this? Is that as high as it goes?

505
02:11:36,470 --> 02:12:22,939
Can't go higher than that. Oh

506
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:34,329
Fuck I just got hurt. I think I just hurt my chest. I'm just thinking about somebody looking at the security camp

507
02:12:36,250 --> 02:12:38,250
This guy fucking dies right there

508
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:45,659
Oh that hurt. Ooh

509
02:12:45,819 --> 02:12:54,649
All right, I'm just thinking somebody looking at the security monitors and oh hey somebody made it somebody got in

510
02:12:55,210 --> 02:12:58,890
Yeah. Yeah, another adventurer. I wonder yeah what's giving the ice move?

511
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:06,729
And the guy throws a bomb against the wall it bounces off and fucking blows the guy smithereen

512
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:12,180
Nope, that one didn't make it wait another 5 000 years for the next one

513
02:13:18,789 --> 02:13:23,800
Okay

514
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:27,880
Oh, well, I just laughed too quickly and I like popped a joint in my rib

515
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:33,079
God damn it

516
02:13:33,079 --> 02:14:22,300
Okay. So how do I get out of here? I can't even make it faster. Where is this door?

517
02:14:22,539 --> 02:14:35,939
This is why you have a team. This is what a team is for guys. The wizard of oz

518
02:14:36,500 --> 02:14:38,500
Told us a long long time ago

519
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:42,100
You get the guy that knows how to do the puzzles the guy that can dodge the x

520
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:47,140
with and they can kill things with melee weapons the strong one the smart one the

521
02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:51,460
The the courageous one, right? We all can do something

522
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:56,069
We let the smart one do the puzzles and then I get in there with the fucking axe

523
02:14:57,180 --> 02:15:00,619
And start swinging. That's the whole that we that we've learned this 100 years ago

524
02:15:00,619 --> 02:15:09,909
That's why you need a team. Let the smart person figure this out while I smoke a cigarette over there in the corner

525
02:15:10,229 --> 02:15:15,930
How do I get out of here? How do I do this?

526
02:15:30,729 --> 02:15:50,409
Stop time. All right. I stopped time on that. This thing is made out of fucking metal. What?

527
02:15:51,050 --> 02:16:30,039
Get in there. Okay. I did it who wants turkey

528
02:16:53,659 --> 02:16:58,899
I gotta have my song. Well, of course Dorothy. Well, what can you do?

529
02:16:59,059 --> 02:17:00,260
well

530
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:08,680
I can dodge an axe with a swift kick fall backwards and smoke a cigarette and salt them with the rain

531
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:49,379
Well, this thing's made out of metal. We're good. Hold on. This is technically this is wait. This is water. Oh my god

532
02:17:49,459 --> 02:17:51,219
Look what you can do

533
02:17:51,219 --> 02:17:54,090
physics

534
02:17:54,090 --> 02:17:55,780
oh

535
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:57,780
physics physics

536
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:09,780
Get up there if I don't make this again. I'm gonna be very upset

537
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:12,420
Okay, what's going on?

538
02:18:14,659 --> 02:18:16,659
Go up i'm getting caught in the

539
02:18:29,430 --> 02:18:30,870
Get on

Spear. Oh monka cool. I think that's it, right? Yeah

543
02:19:51,819 --> 02:19:59,500
Never before seen solutions. What do you what does that mean? All right, you're resourcefulness. You're very resourceful in the name of the goddess

544
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:31,209
Hylia, I bestow upon you this orb cool fucking chest

545
02:20:32,309 --> 02:20:48,149
Why did I have to think about the stupid security footage of somebody dying in this dungeon? Hey, I got them all where's my glider?

546
02:20:55,569 --> 02:21:07,370
Extraordinary link it is finally time for me to tell you everything but first sign this non-disclosure agreement

547
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:25,690
So you can't tell anybody about between me and you I didn't read that where the two

548
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:37,909
Lines connecting the shrines would cross there. I'll be waiting there were four shrines centered amid the four shrines

549
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:42,709
one

550
02:21:42,709 --> 02:21:44,309
two

551
02:21:44,309 --> 02:21:45,579
three

552
02:21:45,579 --> 02:22:23,909
Four right about here. Okay. Why is that not on the map? It has to be a pin not a stamp. Oh

553
02:22:30,649 --> 02:22:38,739
Mm-hmm

554
02:22:38,739 --> 02:22:46,299
You bet your ass I can dodge it every weapon held in two hands if you only swung an axe

555
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:52,010
Yeah, I talk about in that movie

556
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:59,639
I how I can dodge everything and then I just get an arrow like through the temple like just goes like

557
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:06,250
Can't dodge that

558
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:12,809
Okay

559
02:23:12,809 --> 02:23:22,299
So you said it was a stamp not a marker. So then it's it's it's the yeah

560
02:23:22,299 --> 02:23:33,100
It's this so make a pen. There we go. Badly damaged

561
02:23:34,729 --> 02:23:49,829
Who needs it? Okay, so it's right there. You needed to use the ice pillar to lift the gate

562
02:23:52,379 --> 02:23:55,180
Man, you look like we can play the game two different ways

563
02:23:55,899 --> 02:24:15,459
It's a little chilly out though

564
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:30,819
A sword and stone can I climb and hold on?

565
02:24:46,159 --> 02:24:55,540
Rusty broadsword does not you do that does not constitute putting that into a stone like that

566
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:58,520
That's not that interesting

567
02:25:17,049 --> 02:25:21,159
Oh

568
02:25:21,159 --> 02:26:02,379
Opal not a bad find. Oh lots of fangs. Okay. I'm here. He's having fun. I don't know. This is good

569
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:07,829
I'm it's just one of those games where there's tons of stuff just to look at and do

570
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:25,370
And play with and find and look a treasure chest with a tooth in it, right? I I like that stuff ancient screw

573
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:36,659

574
02:27:37,139 --> 02:27:43,979
It could get delayed. Couldn't it?

575
02:27:44,059 --> 02:28:00,409
Could another ancient shaft. I kind of want to go up there

576
02:28:04,979 --> 02:28:13,510
Wait rupees no rupees

577
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:20,360

579
02:28:26,309 --> 02:28:32,059

581
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:38,379

582
02:28:38,379 --> 02:28:40,780
Let's go

583
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:46,149
Traveler's bow. Oh beautiful

584
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:55,579
Okay, I don't actually need that. I have like five of these. All right here. Can I throw the bow?

Traveler's shield is fine. And then is there a fast way to switch the bow?

588

605
02:32:19,719 --> 02:32:23,559
I mean, it's my undeniable right as a man of the 90s to quench my thirst in my own way

606
02:32:23,719 --> 02:32:28,780
I want a boku. I've had it people invite me to a party. I'm bringing my own boku

607
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:37,610
Boku fruit juice cooler from mccain. Why why do they have a belt of them? This is stupid. What did he say?

608
02:32:37,850 --> 02:32:53,750
Is it funny he sounds like you doing a voice. Yeah, it was an adult juice box

609
02:32:53,989 --> 02:33:04,729
Okay, well, let's play you who have conquered the shrines and claimed their spirit orbs. I can offer you

610
02:33:04,729 --> 02:33:10,139
I don't I can't dub it. I don't know what what he's saying. It sounds like he's mocking the drink

611
02:33:10,459 --> 02:33:19,799
Oh, he said he's bringing him to a party

612
02:33:20,709 --> 02:33:27,959
Okay, it appears you have four spirit orbs in exchange. I will amplify your being oh

613
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:42,520
This is important you guys adult juice boxes already exist

614
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:50,100
It's called just going and getting orange juice from the grocery store a pretty adult beverage

615
02:33:50,180 --> 02:33:52,659
I would say just orange juice like you can be an adult and drink it

616
02:33:54,899 --> 02:34:03,700
Uh, I think I want the stamina do heart. I want stamina though. I don't feel to move around more and climb more

617
02:34:03,860 --> 02:34:18,409
I'm doing stamina stamina to me is more important. Just don't get hit all the people saying heart container. Just get good

618
02:34:18,729 --> 02:34:26,170
Just don't get hit. Give me a break. Cool. All right, very cool. Ooh, I get extra little

619
02:34:26,329 --> 02:34:42,950
Uh thing there give me the glider. Is my fps on this camera fine?

620
02:34:43,190 --> 02:34:51,079
Yeah, the blessing of the goddess has made you much more resilient. I see here. I am get up here quickly

621
02:34:51,319 --> 02:35:13,399
Do you know that never happened in tf2?

622
02:35:13,479 --> 02:35:18,540
I always tried to get it but it never happened coming out of a map or come out of the spawn and just

623
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:26,840
Knocking a huntsman arrow across the whole map and just waiting to hear that come. I tried it probably

624
02:35:27,379 --> 02:35:32,420
Ten to twenty thousand different times. It's just so hard to do

625
02:35:41,799 --> 02:35:46,040
By the way, if there's not a single way i'm ever gonna play a different zelda game than this

626
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:54,329
As I find this to be a hundred times cooler than any of the zelda games i've ever played he talks

627
02:35:54,569 --> 02:36:02,870
I truly am. I was king rome

628
02:36:03,510 --> 02:36:12,700
Bosporamus hyrule or my shortened name. I was ganondorf the last leader of hyrule a kingdom which no longer exists

629
02:36:15,180 --> 02:36:26,569
Oh, is this the dinner guy?

630
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:32,469
Devastated everything in its path lo a century ago

631
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:37,049
It was then that my life was taken away from me

632
02:36:38,059 --> 02:36:41,819
And since that time here I have remained in spirit form

633
02:36:42,459 --> 02:36:46,620
I did not think it wise to overwhelm you while your memory was still fragile

634
02:36:47,750 --> 02:36:49,750
so rather than that

635
02:36:49,829 --> 02:36:52,229
I thought it best to assume a temporary form

636
02:36:54,729 --> 02:36:56,170
Forgive me

637
02:36:56,170 --> 02:36:58,920
I think you are now ready

638
02:36:59,579 --> 02:37:03,209
Ready to hear what happened three years ago

639
02:37:04,489 --> 02:37:06,729
Somebody said why does he sound hot?

640
02:37:07,770 --> 02:37:13,319
To know kalanin's true form what the fuck one must know the story from an age-long past

641
02:37:13,639 --> 02:37:20,090
The demon king was born into this kingdom, but his transformation into malice created the horror you see now

642
02:37:22,239 --> 02:37:28,579
Stories of ganon were passed from generation to generation in the form of legends and fairy tales

643
02:37:29,139 --> 02:37:31,850
But there was also

644
02:37:31,850 --> 02:37:42,389
Prophecy the signs of a resurrection of calamity ganon are clear the power to oppose it

645
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:47,290
lies dormant

646
02:37:47,370 --> 02:37:53,610
We decided to heed the prophecy and began excavating large areas of land. I'm going to gamelan

647
02:37:54,170 --> 02:38:00,329
Before we discovered several ancient relics to protect me in the hands of our distant ancestors fuck you link

648
02:38:02,059 --> 02:38:08,299
I will eat you for dinner these relics the divine beasts were giant fuck you the king

649
02:38:09,510 --> 02:38:13,290
Fuck you ganon

650
02:38:13,690 --> 02:38:34,780
We also learned of a princess with a sacred power and her appointed knight chosen by the sword that seals the darkness

651
02:38:35,420 --> 02:38:39,659
It was they who sealed ganon away using the power of these ancient relics

652
02:38:41,659 --> 02:38:47,500
100 years ago. There was a princess set to inherit a secret. They always if they wanted to do something that they never said

653
02:38:48,299 --> 02:38:50,940
Stringing together like six different consonants

654
02:38:51,979 --> 02:38:54,969
Right. So if oh i'm going to gamelan

655
02:38:55,530 --> 02:38:57,530
For

656
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,520
Sentence mixing

657
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:45,610
It's so great when it doesn't work at all, but you know what they were trying to do

658
02:39:46,489 --> 02:39:53,370
He appeared from deep below hyrule castle sees definitely have seen videos of the spy from tf2 saying like

659
02:39:55,149 --> 02:39:58,159
My

660
02:40:05,579 --> 02:40:13,340
Like okay, I all right, I know what you were doing. I know what you were trying whatever and thus devastated

661
02:40:18,989 --> 02:40:28,250
However, the princess survived to face ganon alone link

662
02:40:29,979 --> 02:40:33,500
You are our final help

663
02:40:33,739 --> 02:40:35,739
The fate of hyrule rests with you

664
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:42,520
Yeah, if you're like

665
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:45,559
my

666
02:40:45,559 --> 02:40:48,000
Princess was my own daughter

667
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:55,370
My dear zelda and the courageous knight who protected her right up to the very end

668
02:40:57,079 --> 02:41:01,639
That night was none other than you link you

669
02:41:03,159 --> 02:41:10,500
When your fate took an unfortunate turn sure. Yeah, this does this does not seem right taken to the shrine of resurrection

670
02:41:11,059 --> 02:41:16,579
Here you now stand revitalized 100 years in a switch game words of guidance

671
02:41:16,579 --> 02:41:20,579
You have been hearing since your awakening are from princess zelda herself

672
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:23,059
Even now

673
02:41:23,059 --> 02:41:28,420
As she works to restrain ganon from within hyrule castle. She calls out for your help

674
02:41:29,459 --> 02:41:30,659
however

675
02:41:30,659 --> 02:41:33,139
My daughter's power will soon be exhausted

676
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:35,780
once that happens

677
02:41:35,780 --> 02:41:43,540
Ganon will freely regenerate himself and nothing will stop him from consuming our lives. It really what happened to be in my link costume

678
02:41:44,739 --> 02:41:46,739
I'm still link. Does it matter? Who cares?

679
02:41:51,180 --> 02:42:12,049
Link could just put on a green shirt. Who cares? What's the difference must save her as well as those guardians swarming around hyrule castle

680
02:42:12,530 --> 02:42:17,840
I believe it would be quite reckless for you to head directly to the castle at this point

681
02:42:18,559 --> 02:42:21,600
I suggest

682
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:24,879
That you make your way east out to one of the villages in the wilderness

683
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:28,719
Follow the road out to kakariko village

684
02:42:30,209 --> 02:42:32,290
There you will find the elder impa

685
02:42:32,930 --> 02:42:35,569
She will tell you more about the path that lies ahead

686
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:41,329
Consult the map on your sheikah slate for the precise location of kakariko village

687
02:42:42,370 --> 02:42:45,250
Make your way past the twin summits of the dueling peaks

688
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:49,010
From there follow the road as it proceeds north

689
02:42:54,899 --> 02:43:00,659

Yes, that does not do any damage at all though

769
02:59:00,690 --> 02:59:09,860
I'm not strong enough to be here. I actually don't think i'm strong enough to be here

770
02:59:10,100 --> 02:59:21,090
I think you come back in like 10 levels you come back in 10 plus levels

02:59:53,889 --> 02:59:56,690
Um, this is like something you do like in 10 levels or like 20 levels

776
02:59:57,170 --> 02:59:59,969
Because you do the same this is like a late game fight

777
03:00:00,450 --> 03:00:11,709

778
03:00:11,709 --> 03:00:22,030

853
03:18:09,329 --> 03:18:10,209
Oh, okay

854
03:18:10,209 --> 03:18:16,290
They seem to have popped up all over the place and that's not the only strange things happening those long deserted shrines suddenly started glowing

855
03:18:16,610 --> 03:18:21,620
You know what that means. Don't you the end is near with all the craziness happening

856
03:18:21,620 --> 03:18:23,620
I've been keeping an eye on that thing

857
03:18:23,620 --> 03:18:25,620
Just to see if it suddenly starts moving

858
03:18:27,329 --> 03:18:32,979
What thing talk about that guardian, of course, haven't you heard the old stories?

859
03:18:34,690 --> 03:18:37,489
See that thing over there the one shaped like an overturned urn

860
03:18:38,530 --> 03:18:40,770
That is what i'm talking about

861
03:18:40,770 --> 03:18:44,290
Did you know that some of them can move one of them once chased me down and tried to kill me?

862
03:18:46,260 --> 03:18:48,000
No, it was a different one

863
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,639
That one was closer to the castle but before the forest

864
03:18:51,620 --> 03:18:53,389
When they spot you

865
03:18:53,389 --> 03:18:57,780
They shoot blue beams of light at you man. I was so sure that was the end for me

866
03:18:57,780 --> 03:19:02,139
I was prepared for the worst until uh, I got it right in the bone marrow

867
03:19:02,299 --> 03:19:11,180
Let me tell you how to do it. I hear guardians like that still wander

868
03:19:11,899 --> 03:20:23,739
Be careful. Thanks for no info. I'm just doing a physics test. Holy shit. What can I do anything with the ram?

869
03:20:32,260 --> 03:21:42,500
I guess not. What are you doing? Where's my weapon way too high? Oh, this guy's kind of strong. Stop rolling

870
03:21:49,569 --> 03:22:11,889
Boko bat

871
03:22:11,889 --> 03:22:13,889
No, I want to pick up the item

872
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:20,819
Pick it up pick up the pick. I want to do what I just did

873
03:22:22,780 --> 03:22:25,659
Pick up the fucking rock, please. I need to do this

874
03:22:59,360 --> 03:23:08,500
He fucking dropped it on that was bug's bunny level shit right there. Oh

875
03:23:13,170 --> 03:23:16,750
Okay

876
03:23:16,750 --> 03:23:23,549
He was trying to kill me. Oh, that's funny. Okay. All right, so

877
03:23:24,190 --> 03:23:26,430
Uh, what did I get for that? There was a chest right here, right?

878
03:23:27,149 --> 03:23:35,709
And this food over here. Ooh

879
03:23:36,030 --> 03:23:37,069
Thank you

880
03:23:37,069 --> 03:23:47,360
Try toast some more stuff

881
03:23:47,360 --> 03:23:50,370
the opal destroy crates

882
03:23:52,030 --> 03:23:55,860
They have stuff in them. Oh, they do. Okay

883
03:23:57,059 --> 03:24:00,819
crab

884
03:24:00,819 --> 03:24:04,260
Roasted bass. Oh shit. Thank you for the uh reminder. Seriously

885
03:24:05,059 --> 03:24:27,059
Is there a way I can break them without damaging an item? Okay, well that didn't work. I can use the uh use magnet

886
03:24:28,290 --> 03:24:30,850
Oh, I could just blow them up with an idiot

887
03:24:32,639 --> 03:24:34,690
With a magnet

888
03:24:34,690 --> 03:24:54,690
It was a shitty rusty sword. Anyways, who cares? It doesn't matter. Ooh blue rupee

889
03:24:55,250 --> 03:25:42,940
I'm gonna eat one of those crabs. All right, let's keep going base cam is covering what what are you what's going on?

890
03:25:49,760 --> 03:26:00,479
Go to the glowing mountain. I'm just gonna say there's an event on the mountain. What do you mean?

891
03:26:01,280 --> 03:26:28,700
I almost fucking drowned in two feet of water again. Okay. No, no, no nay nay nay nay nay what?

892
03:26:45,299 --> 03:27:45,739
God, I hope link gets in smash brothers this year. I thought it was friendly. Now the camp is this I like the sounds

893
03:27:49,250 --> 03:28:04,860
It's very peaceful over here. There it is. Okay

894
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:43,659
Okay, this and bloodborne are my two favorite games

895
03:28:44,670 --> 03:28:49,920
Well, I if you're saying bloodborne is one of your favorite games and this I probably would agree with you at some point

896
03:28:49,920 --> 03:28:51,360
Maybe we'll find out

897
03:28:51,360 --> 03:28:56,500
Is there anything else I've been over here?

898
03:28:56,500 --> 03:29:01,920
You got me like an item in here, right?

899
03:29:01,920 --> 03:29:25,180
Pass me an item. There's no way there's no item here. Why would there be a camp with no item?

900
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:40,260
What is the actual destination here? Oh my god, that's far away. That's across the whole game

901
03:29:40,579 --> 03:29:45,180
Can I even make it can I make it there?

902
03:29:55,069 --> 03:29:56,719
well

903
03:29:56,719 --> 03:30:00,799
Um, maybe I should activate that thing, right?

904
03:30:01,600 --> 03:30:04,420
Give me some location data

905
03:30:06,850 --> 03:30:08,850
Dude, you just got elden ring

906
03:30:12,290 --> 03:30:15,629
Oh, I kind of did

907
03:30:15,629 --> 03:30:24,139
All right

908
03:30:24,139 --> 03:30:27,180
You can go anywhere and you can climb anything. I got elden ring

909
03:30:27,899 --> 03:30:55,489
Stop saying elden ring elden

910
03:30:55,729 --> 03:30:58,450
Okay, do you know how hard it's gonna be to not say anything about elden ring?

911
03:30:58,450 --> 03:31:04,870
I know i'm not supposed to be but think about it. That was one of like the most ridiculous

912
03:31:06,819 --> 03:31:15,579
Hold on a sec

913
03:31:15,579 --> 03:31:17,819
The bow broken my hands. Okay. Well never mind

914
03:31:23,229 --> 03:31:50,370
Yeah, let's get this guy's another strong one. Oh my god. I just baseball swung him

915
03:31:54,180 --> 03:32:22,190
Where are you going? Is there an instant kill backstab or something that he didn't wake up? Why?

916
03:32:41,700 --> 03:32:45,280
Hello

917
03:32:45,280 --> 03:33:25,219
Why is why did that happen? It was the fire does that really I can cook over here

918
03:33:26,670 --> 03:33:32,420
All right. Oh, let me open it. Let me I want to cook some stuff. All right, so

919
03:33:33,489 --> 03:33:34,530
I have

920
03:33:34,530 --> 03:33:40,659
A lot of random stuff one shroom two shrooms

921
03:33:41,739 --> 03:34:05,920
Okay, how about like a shroom surprise mushroom skewer? Can I just what happens if you just cook one apple?

922
03:34:13,200 --> 03:34:16,459
Simmered fruit. Okay, so it's only one now you gotta

923
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:27,649
This is gonna be three hearts

924
03:34:27,649 --> 03:34:42,879
Right. Yeah. Okay. So it's it's about quantity means more health. I get it. Okay, cool

925
03:34:45,540 --> 03:34:47,299
Was there a chest?

926
03:34:49,340 --> 03:35:02,209
I don't think so, right

927
03:35:02,209 --> 03:35:10,930
Chasing fucking apples around like an idiot chasing apples around like a dumb ass

928
03:35:13,760 --> 03:35:28,219
All right. Let's turn this thing on

929
03:35:28,299 --> 03:35:49,729
Dueling peaks tower. It's a map info here simplify the hud if you want some immersion

930
03:35:50,129 --> 03:36:14,420
Um, I think I want it for now. I think I'd rather have it for now do motion aiming

931
03:36:14,579 --> 03:36:23,840
I hate motion aiming it only ever worked in my brain for the wii using two hands to use a gyroscope is

932
03:36:24,459 --> 03:36:28,620
Unbearable for me. The wii was fine because the wii was one hand, right?

933
03:36:29,180 --> 03:36:33,489
It was almost like a mouse pointer but needing to hold two hands like this

934
03:36:34,209 --> 03:36:46,020
And go like a no, no, no, no doesn't work for me at all. I don't like it use the joycons

935
03:36:46,180 --> 03:36:56,930
Why would I ever use the joycons? The joycons are my least favorite controller ever made

936
03:36:59,940 --> 03:37:08,639
They are hands down the worst possible device that was ever invented. They are so bad. They are so small

937
03:37:09,280 --> 03:37:16,319
The buttons are so tiny pressing. I i'm saying i'm telling you if you try to press

938
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:23,379
X on a joycon if there's a lot there's a real possibility you're going to hit every single other button

939
03:37:23,379 --> 03:37:31,540
That's a face button. They're so bad. They're just so tiny and so it's like hurts to hold them for a long time

940
03:37:42,159 --> 03:37:44,399
Oh, we effing looks like it

941
03:37:47,139 --> 03:37:49,139
It looks like we're seeing some some small f

942
03:37:49,860 --> 03:38:02,829
Behavior here. Okay. Oh, there's a road. It's like a road here a sheikah sensor

943
03:38:03,229 --> 03:38:07,340
The sensor reacts when you are close to shrines that you've not yet visited

944
03:38:07,579 --> 03:38:16,780
Okay, you head in the direction where the reaction is strongest you should be able to find the shrine, okay

945
03:38:19,309 --> 03:38:21,489
Wait, it's on the map. That's weird

946
03:38:22,129 --> 03:38:35,739
When you play dog island, didn't I already play dog island search for shrines by moving in the direction with the strongest signal

947
03:38:36,219 --> 03:39:01,139
shrine nearby

948
03:39:01,139 --> 03:39:08,879
Like this way. Yeah getting some effs. It should even out though. It should be okay in a few minutes

949
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:53,149
So it's this way. Is this am I going the right way here? That's not the right weapon. Let it go flint

950
03:40:09,020 --> 03:40:23,840
I'm going right here. Yeah, it's gonna it's gonna be bad for a little bit. I really I have no idea why

951
03:40:25,229 --> 03:40:29,899
Um, I don't know why i'd be

952
03:40:30,459 --> 03:40:34,860
We were just fine for like almost four hours. Does this make any sense? Ah, I found it

953
03:40:35,579 --> 03:40:49,069
Not a big deal. Yeah, it's all right

954
03:40:49,309 --> 03:40:54,739
Yeah, I don't I really don't get it. It's so bizarre. So I did a 14 hour stream two days ago

955
03:40:55,629 --> 03:41:01,020
I didn't drop one single frame streaming to the same server and now here we are

956
03:41:01,819 --> 03:41:05,100
But not even what a day later a day and a half later

957
03:41:06,379 --> 03:41:09,500
And just kind of shit in the bed now. It's weird. It doesn't make any sense

958
03:41:14,719 --> 03:41:16,100
And it's

959
03:41:16,100 --> 03:41:22,340
The it's not like oh, it's because it's eight o'clock and it's getting busy. I have a fiber to the house

960
03:41:23,520 --> 03:41:25,520
So I don't share a connection with anybody

961
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:28,100
It doesn't make any sense

962
03:41:28,100 --> 03:41:33,020
I don't get it. Okay. Uh, I am re da he

963
03:41:33,579 --> 03:41:35,899
In the name of this, uh, I have a challenge for you

964
03:41:45,709 --> 03:41:47,309
ISP throttle

965
03:41:47,309 --> 03:41:53,069
I don't I mean I have a well, it's a 1000 up connection. I'm only using i'm not using that much

966
03:41:53,549 --> 03:41:54,670
Six up

967
03:41:54,670 --> 03:42:00,420
That's no no way. All right dump that in there

968
03:42:03,489 --> 03:42:04,930
Oh cool

969
03:42:04,930 --> 03:42:19,420
All right, so i'll probably have to uh, let's go somebody said rich andy

970
03:42:20,059 --> 03:42:26,500
Uh, actually no like this connection. This is the dumbest thing about uh high speed internet

971
03:42:27,379 --> 03:42:31,579
So this line is less than a hundred dollars a month

972
03:42:32,899 --> 03:42:37,819
It's less than I think it's like 80 or I think it's like 80 bucks a month for this. I was paying

973
03:42:40,219 --> 03:42:43,100
at the old place

974
03:42:43,100 --> 03:42:49,280
Cox business internet. It was fucking it was like three or four hundred dollars a month and it was for a

975
03:42:50,340 --> 03:43:06,100
20 times slower connection sharing with the whole neighborhood is fucking ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous and it was still shitty

976
03:43:06,100 --> 03:43:12,799
Yep. Oh, yeah, did I just accidentally do this? I wasn't paying any attention. I think I just did it. Okay, cool

977
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:59,860
You see I think it looks like it's fine now, can I launch it? Wait, hold on. Um, what is that?

978
03:44:00,260 --> 03:44:06,959
Why did that what was that for? Wait, wait, wait, hold on. I can stop the ball

979
03:44:07,520 --> 03:45:38,459
Okay, so yeah, you don't like launch it you do launch it. Well, I just I was playing

980
03:45:38,940 --> 03:45:53,840
Uh chess and I'm supposed to play checkers. I'm sitting thinking I gotta freeze it and then knock it three times

981
03:45:53,840 --> 03:47:35,649
So yeah, that's my fault. How do I get that like this? Let's see. Laugh laugh. Go ahead. Laugh

982
03:47:35,889 --> 03:47:52,139
What are you doing? I could have just grabbed the ledge. I could have done that

983
03:47:54,000 --> 03:48:57,059
I actually could have done that and my nose right here is itchy. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Fuck this watch this fuck

984
03:48:57,540 --> 03:49:06,620
That was I that was so close

985
03:49:20,430 --> 03:49:27,440
I fucking had it. You saw it. It was right there. All right last try. I'm not doing this anymore

986
03:49:27,440 --> 03:49:38,450
Who doesn't really matter? What do you mean? Eat it?

987
03:49:48,989 --> 03:49:52,270
I have to do it. I have to do it. I'm not gonna leave till I do I don't care

988
03:49:52,510 --> 03:49:54,030
I don't give a shit if this is the worst

989
03:49:54,030 --> 03:50:16,750
Legend of Zelda place you've ever seen in your life. I don't care. I'm gonna get it. All right gonna run out of food

990
03:50:17,069 --> 03:50:36,780
I'm gonna run out of food if i'm not careful. How did I get on the first time fuck i'm fucking done. I'm done

991
03:50:36,780 --> 03:50:38,780
I'm done. I'm actually done. I'm not running

992
03:50:39,020 --> 03:50:43,500
Fuck you. I had it. It was the first try and I landed if I rolled off like an idiot

993
03:50:43,819 --> 03:51:14,290
I need to run and jump off and then get blown from behind. All right, i'm gonna get full health all that food wasted

994
03:51:14,770 --> 03:51:28,000
Guys, i'll just rob a bunch of trolls and get another two pounds of apples. I'll be all right. Don't worry. Okay

995
03:51:28,399 --> 03:52:08,770
Do I even need that chest go back and get it? I need to stay. Yeah, I know I need to stay

996
03:52:09,170 --> 03:52:25,340
Whatever

997
03:52:25,340 --> 03:52:31,920
So fucking impatient. I just want to get over there and open it

998
03:53:22,239 --> 03:53:24,270
Okay now

999
03:53:24,270 --> 03:53:53,469
Stasis the button somebody said oh because okay. I see I get it. I actually see I get it

1000
03:53:56,260 --> 03:53:59,860
Oh my god, how can one person be so such a fool?

1001
03:54:00,420 --> 03:54:27,229
How can one person be such a fool? Hurry up

1002
03:55:00,239 --> 03:55:18,559
Oh my god, this thing takes forever. I made it climbers bandana. Okay, that really was worth doing

1003
03:55:20,770 --> 03:55:34,000
Can this break this is definitely worth getting can you teleport me back to the beginning so I don't die?

1004
03:55:42,700 --> 03:55:59,059
Cool. All right, so now I can climb better armor never breaks. Cool. That was a cool shrine

1005
03:56:01,739 --> 03:56:08,639
Now where do I want to go? I could keep heading this way, right?

1006
03:56:08,879 --> 03:56:13,739
I would be surprised if there was a way to go up. So i'm gonna head towards the bridge

1007
03:56:15,379 --> 03:56:30,370
This way i'm just gonna keep keep heading over here. I probably should look for a fish, right?

1008
03:56:30,450 --> 03:56:32,370
This is probably the easiest thing to get

1009
03:56:32,370 --> 03:56:46,239
Never mind trying nearby

1010
03:56:50,260 --> 03:56:52,260
Not talking about that one, is it?

1011
03:56:52,420 --> 03:57:16,340

I'm gonna get away. Get away from me. Just keep away from me. I thought I could get away with it

1017
03:58:01,200 --> 03:58:11,940
I probably actually could have gotten away with it on purpose. Oh, I did it on purpose. Oh, yeah

1018
03:58:12,510 --> 03:58:14,909
I thought I could I actually thought I could get away with it. I definitely can

1019
03:58:17,309 --> 03:58:19,309
If they're sleeping, I can definitely just sneak in and do it

1020
03:58:19,950 --> 03:58:21,950
There's no penalty for dying anyways, who cares

1021
03:58:46,239 --> 03:58:49,139
Come the fuck on how did that not hit?

1022
03:59:01,059 --> 03:59:03,120

I definitely want the broadsword

1035
04:01:16,059 --> 04:01:19,340
Hot dogs are overrated. Ah, it depends on where you're getting them from

1036
04:01:22,399 --> 04:01:26,129
Some hot dogs are very overrated. You're right, but not all of them

1037
04:01:32,219 --> 04:01:34,219
Some hot dogs are incredibly overrated

1038
04:01:38,420 --> 04:01:40,420

04:03:13,340 --> 04:03:16,850
Okay cooking into a dish will fortify your bones

1047
04:03:21,020 --> 04:03:22,940
All right, there's definitely food over here

1048
04:03:22,940 --> 04:03:28,379
Uh, not food. There was a cooking fire over there, but I don't have any I don't I have one fish

1049
04:03:29,020 --> 04:03:36,159

Do you know anything about elixirs?

1058
04:04:28,110 --> 04:04:33,620
You can make elixirs by mixing bugs and other small creatures with monster parts

1059
04:04:36,159 --> 04:04:39,360
Most of them are no good for refilling your health, but they can have a lot of unique effects

1060
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:42,299
From elixirs can increase your speed

1061
04:04:42,540 --> 04:04:44,540
resistance to temperatures

1062
04:04:44,540 --> 04:04:46,540
You made it this far without knowing anything about them

1063
04:04:46,860 --> 04:04:56,139
Okay grants a low level haste effect. That's cool

So i've got I think i'm just gonna do raw prime meat an apple

1117
04:14:55,260 --> 04:15:01,979
Right for flavor and a little bit of salt. So this is like an apple salt glazed. Um

1118
04:15:05,229 --> 04:15:06,510

1119
04:15:06,510 --> 04:15:20,670
With oakland guts. I think that's a good start, right? That should be good salt apple glazed. Um

1120
04:15:21,700 --> 04:15:39,409
Pork shoulder or whatever the hell this is don't do apple just salt

And uh mushroom fish and mushroom stew

1125

04:16:32,190 --> 04:17:07,059
That really is a fish and mushroom stew. Do I even have monster parts? So like this and the frog, right?

1132
04:17:36,780 --> 04:17:38,459
Um

1133
04:17:38,459 --> 04:17:40,379

04:17:40,379 --> 04:17:43,739
Just be like hey, um, is there anything I can even do about this or what?

1135
04:17:45,389 --> 04:17:47,149
It's so random

1136
04:17:47,149 --> 04:18:07,540
Pitchfork. Yeah, I I I cannot even I can't come up with the reason why this would ever be happening

1137
04:18:08,260 --> 04:18:10,260
I have fiber to the house

1138
04:18:11,469 --> 04:18:14,670
I will go at a thousand a thousand for 20 straight hours

1139
04:18:15,469 --> 04:18:17,469
and then just

1140
04:18:18,110 --> 04:18:21,870
It just does this for like an hour or two straight sometimes randomly for no reason

1141
04:18:22,829 --> 04:18:36,690
I don't know

1142

1144
04:18:52,540 --> 04:19:10,299
Looks like I saved it

1145
04:19:10,299 --> 04:19:31,409
Hey interesting

1146
04:19:31,969 --> 04:20:11,680

Did I not a stamina? What the hell just happened? That was gonna work. That was gonna actually work. That was gonna be fine

1149
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:40,129

1150
04:20:40,129 --> 04:20:42,770
All right. All right. I i'm gonna jump from here and just glide over it. Wait

1151
04:20:43,780 --> 04:20:45,780
Can I climb this and just do that instead?

1152
04:20:51,549 --> 04:21:05,219
No, that's definitely what that's what i'm doing. I probably don't have to go that high

1153
04:21:06,340 --> 04:21:08,340
There we go. Okay, so

1154
04:21:08,659 --> 04:21:54,590
I can't

1155
04:21:54,590 --> 04:22:05,329
Look at my hair. My hair's really kind of greasy today

Uh, all right from here. Oh

1159
04:22:53,020 --> 04:23:03,819
That's neat. Why did I not die? Did I?

1160
04:23:04,860 --> 04:23:08,780
Why did I think that was ever going to be a thing that would work? I thought I could get around it

1161
04:23:22,850 --> 04:25:50,500
Ooh weird. Okay, fuck

1162
04:27:16,459 --> 04:27:19,819
I don't want to go. I just didn't want to run all the way back up here and do it

1163
04:27:20,059 --> 04:27:54,110
Uh, you know what i'm saying?

1164
04:29:04,930 --> 04:29:06,930
You fucking asshole

1165
04:31:06,530 --> 04:31:08,530
I'll dodge an axe if you swing it at me

1166
04:31:08,979 --> 04:31:21,440
I'm the I told you I'm smoking fucking cigarettes in the corner. I have to like get it at the right angle and freeze it

1167
04:31:26,530 --> 04:31:30,049
You know what I mean? I gotta it's gotta move and then I gotta freeze it

1168
04:31:36,319 --> 04:31:37,920
Yeah

1169
04:31:37,920 --> 04:31:48,979
Are we still dropping frames?

1170
04:31:48,979 --> 04:31:55,649
Is this still happening?

1171
04:31:55,649 --> 04:32:00,670
Yeah, god damn it. I don't get it

1172
04:32:01,620 --> 04:32:03,059
I don't understand

1173
04:32:03,059 --> 04:32:04,420
I don't get it

1174
04:32:04,420 --> 04:32:06,020
Doesn't make any sense

1175
04:32:06,020 --> 04:32:40,959
I need two more right? I like this aspect of the game. It's really cool. The shrines are

1176
04:32:41,760 --> 04:33:00,579
Some of my favorite part you like the worst part of the game. Really? I think it's really fun. I like it

1177
04:33:10,590 --> 04:33:24,319
Okay, so now I got this i gotta go up here. That's far away, but i'll make it i'll get a horse

1178
04:33:24,639 --> 04:34:06,049
Well, I gotta find a wild horse I get it's not just gonna happen. They're right here. I want the blue one

1179
04:34:06,209 --> 04:34:36,270
I'll take this one instead

1180
04:34:59,259 --> 04:35:14,500
Got it

1181
04:35:14,740 --> 04:35:17,389
What is that

1182
04:35:17,389 --> 04:35:19,389
What did I just do?

1183
04:35:20,189 --> 04:35:23,069
How do you ride the how do you actually ride the horse?

1184
04:35:26,930 --> 04:36:06,959
Is there a jump? I want to register this horse, please. I want to talk

1185
04:36:09,020 --> 04:36:11,020
Get back here come back back back back

1186
04:36:25,279 --> 04:36:27,759
I want to register this horse

1187
04:36:44,220 --> 04:37:03,340
Thank you. Jesus. Oh, okay. Yes 20 rupees saddle and riddle. Yeah, let's do it

1188
04:37:03,979 --> 04:37:19,500
I need a name. Um, I don't know. I'm gonna go pee. I haven't peed in like five hours

1189
04:37:22,029 --> 04:37:26,459
Pee, all right pee break and we'll come back and you'll see what the horse is named

1190
04:37:30,540 --> 04:38:11,889
In the meantime the stream might f for a second. Well, I do a test of some sort right back. Yeah, I don't understand

1191
04:38:12,209 --> 04:38:22,700
So I just i'm doing speed test right now. I have I mean it's maybe that it's a stable

1192
04:38:23,959 --> 04:38:33,900
900 up I gotta talk to somebody at data twitch bad and I actually have to do it now because I don't

1193
04:38:34,779 --> 04:38:39,659
Something about where my connection is hopping from vegas to the servers. I go to it's just

1194
04:38:40,299 --> 04:38:52,259
Something happens all the time and it I don't think it can't be something on my end

1195
04:38:53,259 --> 04:38:59,729
It's hard to determine that because two days ago I streamed for 14 hours and we didn't drop one frame not one

1196
04:39:01,180 --> 04:39:06,689
Same time frame two same time friday night. It's not like oh, yeah

1197
04:39:06,770 --> 04:39:09,169
You're streaming on like a wednesday at two o'clock in the morning

1198
04:39:09,169 --> 04:39:17,229
I mean that was friday at eight nine ten o'clock at night not one frame here. We are sunday night and

1199
04:39:18,819 --> 04:39:25,979
For what for four hours is not a single frame. It's just bizarre and then it's oh

1200
04:39:26,700 --> 04:39:30,700
Now all of a sudden you're just going to start dropping packets to twitch

1201
04:39:31,810 --> 04:39:40,240
Why go pee? No, I will I will but just so it doesn't make any sense right like

1202
04:39:40,799 --> 04:39:43,520
Okay, if I was consistently having internet problems, that would make sense

1203
04:39:43,919 --> 04:39:49,869
But you can't have a stream go flawlessly for four hours and then randomly at like 8 15

1204
04:39:50,509 --> 04:39:53,299
It's just oh now everything sucks

1205
04:39:53,299 --> 04:39:57,459
And if I do a speed test or if I do like an upload test, it's like no your connection is perfectly normal

1206
04:39:58,349 --> 04:40:00,590
It's the it's the data leaving here

1207
04:40:01,310 --> 04:40:02,830
from vegas

1208
04:40:02,830 --> 04:40:06,509
It's hitting some point some hop in a trace route, right if you did one

1209
04:40:06,990 --> 04:40:10,669
And it's just junking up somewhere on the road at some point. I don't get it

1210
04:40:10,990 --> 04:46:56,880
I don't know, but i'm gonna go pee i'll be right back. Okay, i'm back

1211
04:46:59,409 --> 04:47:05,259
Looks like I didn't drop a frame while I was gone. It's kind of strange

1212
04:47:08,000 --> 04:47:46,099
Okay, sorry. I scared you frank. Do I like it? I the game is great. Yeah, okay

1213
04:47:46,099 --> 04:47:59,759
Can horses die can a horse die? So if I go out with this horse, can I the horse die? Okay?

1214
04:48:00,240 --> 04:48:16,220
I'm kind of concerned about that. Be honest. Okay, so I need to go from here. We need to go straight

1215
04:48:16,860 --> 04:48:24,990
Right. I'm just gonna go on the road

1216
04:48:26,990 --> 04:48:52,529
How do you turn? Yeah, this is this is nice. It's a good looking horse. Okay. Here's a uh, this is this bridge out

1217
04:48:53,169 --> 04:48:56,159
Acarico bridge

1218
04:48:56,159 --> 04:49:22,849
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. I'm almost there. It's pretty cool. See i'm petting the horse. I'm fine

1219
04:49:39,020 --> 04:49:41,020
I'm sad. I ran over a

1220
04:49:41,659 --> 04:49:50,479
Animal can you is there no jumping with the horse bones actually

1221
04:50:06,849 --> 04:50:08,849
It's automatic jumping okay

1222
04:50:22,900 --> 04:50:28,349
Turning is hard

1223
04:50:28,349 --> 04:50:30,349
Go what's wrong?

1224
04:50:35,840 --> 04:50:43,150
Okay, go back go back you walked past broccoli man. Who's broccoli man?

1225
04:50:45,299 --> 04:50:47,459
Go go you walked past broccoli man

1226
04:50:49,439 --> 04:50:51,439
That's broccoli man. Okay

1227
04:51:02,639 --> 04:51:06,740
Do this, okay

1228
04:51:06,740 --> 04:51:08,479
You can see me

1229
04:51:08,479 --> 04:51:19,279
I can see you. Oh, i'm hestu and I need your this is okay where we bring this stuff

1230
04:51:19,680 --> 04:51:36,880
I can't use my powers without them

1231
04:51:36,880 --> 04:51:41,650
Please please get my maracas back from them. You got it

1232
04:52:25,650 --> 04:52:27,650
I was trying to ram. I was trying to ram

1233
04:52:35,090 --> 04:52:39,729
Is that not okay? This the horse is causing all kinds of problems. I'm gonna get off the horse

1234
04:52:40,290 --> 04:52:47,389
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that twice

1235
04:52:59,259 --> 04:53:01,259
It's i'm trying so hard to turn

1236
04:53:02,720 --> 04:53:05,759
You know what? Just hang it out here. You're fine. Just just chill out there. We'll be good

1237
04:53:08,020 --> 04:53:10,020
Got a little bit of business to take care of. Oh, yeah escape

1238
04:53:11,810 --> 04:53:49,810
I spit everywhere. I

1239
04:53:50,450 --> 04:53:59,090
I just so impatient

1240
04:53:59,169 --> 04:54:02,209
Lock on it's the I I want to be able to just

1241
04:54:03,090 --> 04:54:05,090
Attack, you know what I mean?

1242
04:54:08,560 --> 04:54:12,319
Give me this. I this thing fuck this thing. Give me this thing way better

1243
04:54:14,290 --> 04:54:23,889
I'm using an actual item

1244
04:54:40,020 --> 04:54:43,069
There we go

1245
04:54:43,069 --> 04:54:49,580
Use spells. What spell would you want me to use freeze one?

1246
04:54:52,270 --> 04:55:03,500
Ooh

1247
04:55:03,500 --> 04:55:09,810
Pyromancy, okay. Hestu's maracas. This game is sick

1248
04:55:13,569 --> 04:55:17,169
Okay, let me let me take a quick look and see what I would rate this right now out of 10

1249
04:55:17,889 --> 04:55:20,830
I probably would give it like a four

1250
04:55:20,830 --> 04:55:41,520
Yeah, I mean the only reason it's not getting a zero is so people don't get really mad when I give it a low score

1251
04:55:42,270 --> 04:55:49,200
I think a four is okay

1252
04:55:49,200 --> 04:56:08,369
But no, this is really fun. I like it a lot. This is this definitely it's pretty high

1253
04:56:08,930 --> 04:56:11,979
so far

1254
04:56:11,979 --> 04:56:15,099
It's just really fun. It's it's there's lots of fun things to do

1255
04:56:21,150 --> 04:56:22,830
Here are your maracas

1256
04:56:22,830 --> 04:56:26,299
Can we get a number that why would you want a number?

1257
04:56:29,700 --> 04:56:31,810
It's definitely better than the eight

1258
04:56:31,810 --> 04:56:37,360
It's 100 higher than an eight. It's somewhere between eight and ten. I just don't know which I don't know where

1259
04:56:37,840 --> 04:56:54,049
I need to keep going. This game is objectively better than elden ring. We'll see. I don't know

1260
04:57:00,029 --> 04:57:08,849
Inventory expansion. That's a huge deal. I have one

1261
04:57:16,479 --> 04:57:24,029
um, yeah

1262
04:57:24,029 --> 04:57:35,150
Oh, definitely weapon, right? I keep having so much trouble. I have so much trouble with weapons. No frames dropped either

1263
04:57:37,009 --> 04:57:39,009
In the last like 10 minutes

1264
04:57:41,139 --> 04:57:43,139
Is there scientists that we can explain how that's possible?

1265
04:57:48,029 --> 04:57:49,229
Okay

1266
04:57:49,229 --> 04:57:51,229
da na na na na

1267
04:57:54,110 --> 04:58:12,930
The weapon stash has been expanded good to know that's where I need to mark this, right?

1268
04:58:13,169 --> 04:58:21,180
Okay, i'm gonna stamp this a pin here. Yeah, I need to put a pin here. Uh, i'm gonna say this is

1269
04:58:21,819 --> 04:58:32,689
Uh this right? Okay, let's keep going. Are you gonna collect all 900 seeds?

1270
04:58:34,830 --> 04:58:39,869
I would be happy if I were to get the first boss on stream

1271
04:58:40,509 --> 04:58:44,080
Be real

1272
04:58:44,799 --> 04:58:51,979
I don't you guys all right. It's been it's been about five hours of this game. It's time to do the uh, the poll

1273
04:58:54,659 --> 04:58:57,299
Vote if you do you want to see more?

1274
04:58:57,860 --> 04:59:01,950
Elders I really almost said elden ring. Do you want to see more?

1275
04:59:02,509 --> 04:59:03,869
Breath of the wild

1276
04:59:03,869 --> 04:59:08,110
Would you like me to keep playing this? Would you like me to be what this what I play when I stream again?

1277
04:59:09,819 --> 04:59:13,500
Like the next stream the next stream that you see on this channel. Do you want it to be this?

1278
04:59:20,319 --> 04:59:23,340
We need a poll

1279
04:59:23,340 --> 04:59:29,470
Well, the one is yes two is no do you want this to be the next thing that I play like

1280
04:59:30,189 --> 04:59:33,580
On the next stream just keep going

1281
04:59:33,659 --> 04:59:36,939
A lot of people were I mean no internet problems probably uh booted a lot of you guys

1282
04:59:36,939 --> 04:59:41,740
But there were a lot of people here tonight a surprising amount of people so

1283
04:59:42,860 --> 04:59:44,860
You guys like it. I'll definitely keep playing it

1284
04:59:47,759 --> 04:59:50,240
I like it. So if you guys like it, then why not?

1285
04:59:57,259 --> 05:00:02,959
Yeah, use the pole load on that pole drying somewhere

1286
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:17,139
Oh, this is kakariko village

1287
05:00:17,139 --> 05:00:27,279
Travel i'm sorry, but I seem to have twisted my ankle. All right. Sorry. You had to see me like that

1288
05:00:29,250 --> 05:00:33,810
Say traveler

1289
05:00:33,810 --> 05:00:42,290
Where'd you get that object hanging from your waist? I found it. I'm the dead guy that I killed

1290
05:00:43,250 --> 05:00:53,700
Okay, we've been waiting for you for a very long time. I must insist that you meet with our leader

1291
05:00:54,340 --> 05:01:03,759
Lady impa lady impa's house is below lantern falls just over there

1292
05:01:05,389 --> 05:01:12,110
In any case, it was a real honor to meet you. Nice to meet you, too

1293
05:01:14,639 --> 05:01:16,639
They probably have a shrine in here

1294
05:01:16,959 --> 05:01:18,959
Somewhere right I imagine

1295
05:01:19,200 --> 05:01:27,580
I want to do that for I like the shrines the most

1296
05:01:29,580 --> 05:01:31,819
Wow, that's a lot. That's 90. Damn

1297
05:01:32,540 --> 05:01:35,729
I cannot deny that

1298
05:01:35,729 --> 05:01:38,930
I can't deny that that's way too high to deny

1299
05:01:40,270 --> 05:01:51,889
Uh, so we're gonna keep playing breath of the wild. There's 120 shrines in the game

1300
05:01:54,139 --> 05:02:05,549
Wow

1301
05:02:05,549 --> 05:02:07,549
Yes, it looks like everybody voted

1302
05:02:09,450 --> 05:02:11,450
4 000 of you

1303
05:02:11,470 --> 05:02:18,099
89 said to play more. Um, but breath of the wild nice

1304
05:02:22,750 --> 05:02:25,310
Okay, that's uh, i'm i'm excited. I think

1305
05:02:40,700 --> 05:02:42,139
Why did I pretend to like it?

1306
05:02:42,139 --> 05:02:49,250
I'm gonna just break my switch with a hammer and then show everybody on twitter be like, I don't know

1307
05:02:49,250 --> 05:02:57,389
I dropped my switch. I fucking shattered. I have to play, uh multiverses instead shield of the mind's eye

1308
05:02:57,950 --> 05:03:21,150
Stop closing my stuff. I want hot mic hot mic

1309
05:03:29,090 --> 05:03:30,689
No, actually, i'm happy

1310
05:03:30,689 --> 05:03:35,729
It's a micro boss micro boss

1311
05:03:39,060 --> 05:03:41,060
Finally, I unlocked the dodge roll

1312
05:03:43,950 --> 05:04:07,709
Oh my god, finally. Wait, did I have it the whole time lorry rush?

1313
05:04:08,430 --> 05:04:19,060
What I didn't that's new

1314
05:04:22,450 --> 05:04:25,090
Do a backflip to avoid enemy attacks and create an opening to strike back

1315

Yeah back pedal

I hit the wrong button. I'm

1318
05:04:41,419 --> 05:04:43,180
Again, i'll say this again

1319
05:04:43,180 --> 05:04:47,500
I hate so badly that all the controllers like across the consoles the controllers are different

1320
05:04:48,380 --> 05:04:54,419
Like i'm pressing where b is on xbox and b is like I wish it was just universal

Button law. Yeah button rant. I know that's what i'm saying

1322
05:05:12,450 --> 05:05:15,599

05:05:16,799 --> 05:05:23,650

1338
05:08:50,930 --> 05:08:58,819
I think we're gonna stop playing during omega gaming weekend

1339
05:08:58,819 --> 05:09:21,419
I'm not sure if it's gonna be a five-hour stream on omega sunday present sleeper. Just relax. Just chill. Just chill out. It's all good

05:10:57,330 --> 05:10:59,889
You remember me don't you?

1349
05:11:00,529 --> 05:11:19,740

Please come a bit closer max level of redditor

1353
05:12:16,189 --> 05:12:27,810
Uh, a hundred years ago the kingdom of hyrule was destroyed after you fell princess zelda's final wish was to place you in it

1354
05:12:27,810 --> 05:12:37,700
Wait, so I lost really and then alone. She went to face ganon

1355
05:12:37,860 --> 05:12:45,599
She entrusted me with some words. She wished to say to you

1356
05:12:45,919 --> 05:12:52,930
I've been waiting a hundred years to deliver the princess's message. What is it? However

1357
05:12:53,569 --> 05:12:56,290
These words which the princess risked her life to leave you

1358
05:12:57,180 --> 05:13:01,200
Well, if you are to hear them, you must be prepared to risk your life as well

1359
05:13:01,439 --> 05:13:07,459
I'm afraid that burden may be too much to bear while you are still without your memories

1360
05:13:07,779 --> 05:13:13,139
I'll leave the choice to you when you feel you are ready to receive the princess's message returned to me

1361
05:13:23,090 --> 05:13:28,779
What are they not a memory to your name yet?

1362
05:13:28,779 --> 05:13:32,700
You are as intent as ever to charge forward with only courage and justice on your side

1363
05:13:32,860 --> 05:13:43,950
You've not changed a bit once a hero always a hero very well. Here we go

1364
05:13:44,189 --> 05:13:51,840
He's gonna tell us everything long ago

1365
05:13:52,819 --> 05:13:57,810
history of the royal family is also the history of

1366
05:13:58,509 --> 05:14:04,110
calamity ganon a primal evil that has endured over the ages

1367
05:14:04,750 --> 05:14:09,939
This evil has been turned back time and again

1368
05:14:12,110 --> 05:14:17,790
The soul of a hero and a princess who carries the blood of the goddess

1369
05:14:18,430 --> 05:14:25,919
with the passage of time

1370
05:14:26,400 --> 05:14:30,240
Each conflict with ganon faded into legend

1371
05:14:31,200 --> 05:14:34,479
So listen closely as I tell you of this

1372
05:14:34,939 --> 05:14:39,139
Legend that occurred 10,000 years ago

1373
05:14:42,349 --> 05:14:44,349
What are the words? What's the secret sentence?

1374
05:14:44,909 --> 05:15:07,439
Was then their technological prowess to ensure the safety of the land

1375
05:15:08,080 --> 05:15:10,959
Should calamity ganon ever return?

1376
05:15:18,819 --> 05:15:26,919
They constructed four mechanical wonders that came to be known as the divine beasts

1377
05:15:27,700 --> 05:15:32,500
They also built a region of autonomous weapons

1378
05:15:33,060 --> 05:15:53,310
Called guardians those are things that I was fighting the shoot lasers was for

1379
05:15:53,950 --> 05:16:00,790
Where's my little fairy friend? No, but that's the one with the elmo voice

1380
05:16:38,909 --> 05:16:40,909
Music's pretty uh

1381
05:16:42,990 --> 05:16:46,189
The darkness delivered his final blow

1382
05:16:46,909 --> 05:16:51,229
The princess used her sacred power to seal away

1383
05:16:51,930 --> 05:17:12,779
calamity ganon

1384
05:17:12,779 --> 05:17:26,419
Okay, we strove to follow the lead of our ancestors of 10,000 years prior. Okay, but in the end

1385
05:17:26,900 --> 05:17:36,099
Despite our best efforts and careful planning we underestimated his power in order to avoid making that grave mistake again

1386
05:17:36,419 --> 05:17:40,029
The princess left you these words

1387
05:17:44,529 --> 05:17:49,150
Free the four divine beasts is what she said

1388
05:17:54,189 --> 05:17:55,630
What the heck?

1389
05:17:55,630 --> 05:17:58,189
Berked up a little bit on that one

1390
05:17:58,270 --> 05:18:10,930
The four divine beasts are the ancient shika weapons wielded by the four champions who ganon defeated

1391
05:18:13,279 --> 05:18:14,380
va

1392
05:18:14,380 --> 05:18:16,159
radania controlled by

1393
05:18:16,159 --> 05:18:20,740
the rook of the gorons the divine beast of va meadow

1394
05:18:20,979 --> 05:18:28,189
Controlled by a rivale of the rito the divine beast va ruta controlled by mipha of the zora

1395
05:18:29,009 --> 05:18:34,549
And the divine beast va neboros controlled by urbosa of the gerudo

1396
05:18:36,779 --> 05:18:40,060
Extremely ill-advised to face ganon without the power of the divine beast to help you

1397
05:18:41,090 --> 05:18:46,049
You must infiltrate the divine beast that were stolen away by ganon 100 years ago and bring them back to our side

1398
05:18:46,750 --> 05:18:53,950
Or hold left trigger and step forward hold left trigger step forward and teleport across the entire game

1399
05:18:54,349 --> 05:19:03,869
And kill the final boss in one swing and beat the game in four minutes more information about these divine beasts

1400
05:19:04,189 --> 05:19:18,500
Can be found by locating the four races scattered across hyrule. My goodness. This was big dude. You want a hit of my jewel pod

1401
05:19:18,979 --> 05:19:20,900
Oh, bro. Yeah, let me see

1402
05:19:20,900 --> 05:19:30,560
You got handed over man. Thanks, dude. Cool. All right. Cool this thing here that's on the ground

1403
05:19:31,500 --> 05:19:37,250
Don't stop doing that. Come on. Gwen. Yeah, do you mind put that up?

1404
05:19:42,209 --> 05:19:47,180
The device princess elda left you is your guide and also your memory now

1405
05:19:47,259 --> 05:19:52,540
Let's see someone at the research lab in hateno village might be able to help you

1406
05:19:52,779 --> 05:20:06,419
Where's that across the whole world one of the very few places that avoided suffering significant damage during the great calamity

1407
05:20:09,619 --> 05:20:17,389
A lot of quests get mario kart installed

1408
05:20:20,639 --> 05:20:41,500
It's freddy dreads birthday. Happy birthday freddy dread. What's up? Uh, hey

1409
05:20:43,150 --> 05:20:57,779
Oh, sorry. Hold on. I got stuck on the door. I got all this swag. Sorry. Should I talk master link?

1410
05:20:58,020 --> 05:21:03,060
Whatever is the matter at this hour dark magic preys upon the land when darkness falls

1411
05:21:03,619 --> 05:21:11,740
Please promise to take care

1412
05:21:14,259 --> 05:21:17,069
Read the book by the door

1413
05:21:17,069 --> 05:21:19,069
journal of various worries

1414
05:21:20,750 --> 05:21:27,119
Well, my wife left me today. The last thing she said to me was what's more important cuckoos or me?

1415
05:21:27,680 --> 05:21:33,229
I chose the cuckoos painter unfamiliar to any of us has arrived in the village

1416
05:21:33,630 --> 05:21:40,020
He claims he is searching for the great fairy's fountain, but that's near where the village's spirit protector resides

1417
05:21:40,909 --> 05:21:46,340
We must make sure the outsider doesn't learn the location of the fountain or the two shrines near it

1418
05:21:49,580 --> 05:21:52,380
That new guy in town looks like he really knows how to tune a bow

1419
05:21:52,779 --> 05:22:04,529
I hope he comes by and knocks an arrow for me. It's been way too long. I'm just gonna read this

1420
05:22:07,119 --> 05:22:15,779
All right. Let's check. Where's that? I want another shrine. Okay

1421
05:22:17,470 --> 05:22:19,470
We need to protect lady impa

1422
05:22:21,779 --> 05:22:26,979
Technology became the key to sealing ganon away during the great calamity some 10 000 years ago

1423
05:22:29,569 --> 05:22:30,529
Okay

1424
05:22:30,529 --> 05:22:33,700
Okay

1425
05:22:33,700 --> 05:22:45,580

1431
05:23:40,700 --> 05:23:46,220
They don't actually like it. They just like oh, oh goat cheese is on that. No, you don't actually I know you don't like it

1432
05:23:46,459 --> 05:23:48,400

05:23:50,380 --> 05:23:53,659
It's fucking I hate it. It's one of my least favorite things in the world

1435
05:23:57,900 --> 05:23:59,090
it

1436
05:23:59,090 --> 05:24:01,090
Goat cheese is one of those things

1437
05:24:01,490 --> 05:24:05,889
That overpowers every single thing on the plate

1438
05:24:06,450 --> 05:24:13,279
It is unbearable if there's goat cheese on something. All you're going to taste is goat cheese. It's just going to be that like

1439
05:24:15,310 --> 05:24:26,659
Like dirt like rotten dirt taste. Oh my god. It's so awful. That's an incredibly wrong opinion

1440
05:24:26,900 --> 05:24:31,220
I'm i'm sorry goat cheese is fucking filthy. I hate it more than anything

1441
05:24:32,029 --> 05:24:35,790
That's a rare germa l. No, it's a it's a it's a common germa win

Goat cheese. Yes or no feta is not goat cheese. It is not feta is not goat cheese feta is not goat cheese

1448
05:25:17,259 --> 05:25:19,259

Feta is not goat cheese. Incorrect. Feta is not goat cheese incorrect

1450
05:25:33,790 --> 05:25:34,990
germa l

Absolute germa l for real

1452
05:25:41,090 --> 05:25:45,250
We do this every time i'm just telling you right now. I cannot believe people like that

1453
05:25:45,729 --> 05:25:52,880
What's the poll at?

1454
05:25:52,880 --> 05:26:02,459
I'm fucking believable. I cannot believe that half of you like goat cheese. There's no way

1455
05:26:03,889 --> 05:26:07,819
I don't find that to be possible. No way

1456
05:26:10,659 --> 05:26:15,060
I must be one of those people that has the the piece of dna in my body

1457
05:26:17,389 --> 05:26:21,470
Where when you eat cilantro, it's like you're eating soap and you want to throw up

1458
05:26:26,419 --> 05:26:32,419
If goat cheese is in something it ruins the entire dish. It's so awful. It's so awful

1459
05:26:33,380 --> 05:26:39,139
No way. I'm shocked at this 51 think goat cheese is good. It is it is like

1463
05:26:58,299 --> 05:27:02,590
Oh the mcdonald's, uh, the mcdonald's, uh fucking

It sucks every time it's on anything

1469
05:27:30,590 --> 05:27:32,909
You eat mcdonald's mcdonald's is fucking delicious

1470
05:27:43,520 --> 05:27:46,979
Oh, I hate it

1471
05:27:48,240 --> 05:27:51,919
I just think of the way that it feels when you when you eat a piece of goat cheese

1472
05:27:52,560 --> 05:27:54,560
It's like poison

1473
05:27:55,279 --> 05:28:03,540
Any listen i'm gonna i'll move on in a second. I promise i'll move on in a second. I promise this is really important

1474
05:28:04,900 --> 05:28:06,900
If it wasn't so powerful

1475
05:28:08,619 --> 05:28:11,180
So, you know when you take a bite of food and it takes a second

1476
05:28:11,180 --> 05:28:17,259
It's like oh i'm going to take a bite of this whatever's on it this tomato this lettuce or onion peppers or meat

1477
05:28:17,580 --> 05:28:19,259
Turkey cheese doesn't matter

1478
05:28:19,259 --> 05:28:23,580
When you take a bite of food, it takes a second. It's like, oh, okay. Here are the flavors

1479
05:28:24,700 --> 05:28:28,380
That's the tomato. I can taste that that's what beef tastes like that's what chicken tastes like

1480
05:28:28,939 --> 05:28:30,939
goat cheese is this immediate

1481
05:28:32,139 --> 05:28:34,139
immediate like

1482
05:28:35,020 --> 05:28:39,819
Flavor it's it's like right when it touches your lip. It's just like oh what's on this

1483
05:28:40,459 --> 05:28:41,819
Goat cheese

1484
05:28:41,819 --> 05:28:46,540
It's like it's immediately. It's just so powerful and it hits me. It's so strong

1485
05:28:47,259 --> 05:28:51,259
It's like oh, it's like grinding up a fucking weed and just like oh man. What's that?

1486
05:28:51,819 --> 05:28:54,540
Oh my god. Okay. That's that's very heavy

1487
05:28:56,060 --> 05:29:05,580
It's I whatever goat cheese is the ground up pot version of cheese. It just stinks and it tastes it just

1488
05:29:10,169 --> 05:29:13,520
What was the final of the poll?

1489
05:29:13,520 --> 05:29:18,000
It's it. Yeah. Yeah, we got some mods in here that know what they're talking about. It takes me out of every dish

1490
05:29:20,139 --> 05:29:22,459
because the second that the goat cheese hits it

1491
05:29:23,610 --> 05:29:32,330
Just paints over everything else. Okay. Well, I don't want to buy any of this

1492
05:29:35,770 --> 05:29:37,770
Bro, you literally drank urine

1493
05:29:40,909 --> 05:29:42,909
When did I drink piss on stream?

1494
05:29:46,000 --> 05:29:49,279
When did I drink pee? I drank pee on stream

1495
05:29:50,080 --> 05:30:00,970
when

1496
05:30:00,970 --> 05:30:02,970
He doesn't remember when did I drink pee?

1497
05:30:09,229 --> 05:30:11,229
It was the pee drinking stream event

1498
05:30:13,680 --> 05:30:14,560
Oh

1499
05:30:14,560 --> 05:30:15,759
Right, right, right

1500
05:30:15,759 --> 05:30:24,000
But that's for an event though

1501
05:30:24,000 --> 05:30:27,919
I remember. Yeah, I remember I was trying to see if I could be I could be my own water filter, right?

1502
05:30:28,860 --> 05:30:33,020
I thought that like I could filter out shit and drink the pee and stuff and it was cleaning the

1503
05:30:33,340 --> 05:30:36,540
Essentially, I was drinking pee because I was trying to be my own filter

1504
05:30:37,500 --> 05:30:40,090
Um my own water filter

1505
05:30:40,090 --> 05:30:45,450
Oh speaking of water filters. This is weird. I was gonna tweet this but I didn't because it was kind of odd

1506
05:30:45,770 --> 05:30:47,689
Maybe i'll put the picture up here

1507
05:30:47,689 --> 05:30:50,330
So I got these water quality test strips

1508
05:30:51,720 --> 05:30:55,000
Just to test the water. It's like oh 16 in one test strips

1509
05:30:56,000 --> 05:31:06,540
So I pissed on one for a joke and to see like what my like fucking vitamin levels were and um

1510
05:31:06,540 --> 05:31:11,849
It was kind of fucked up. There was a shitload of lead in my piss. Is that bad?

1511
05:31:14,110 --> 05:31:18,029
I just like I pissed on one and I just like shook it and I was like what and there was a shitload of lead

1512
05:31:18,270 --> 05:31:25,919
The lead indicator was really high. Is that bad? Is that actually bad? Like hold on. Let me show you put the picture up

1513
05:31:26,330 --> 05:31:41,049
I actually might not be able to get it. Ask a doctor that explains a lot that explains a lot. No, it doesn't shut up

1514
05:31:41,680 --> 05:31:49,919
Get out of here. I I actually it was bright red and bright red was like you have a bunch of lead in your piss

1515
05:31:51,279 --> 05:31:55,520
No, but it's not it's not a hold on. It's not a piss test. It was a water

1516
05:31:56,000 --> 05:32:00,080
Quality test where you dunk it in like whatever your water is and then you read it

1517
05:32:00,159 --> 05:32:15,720
It's probably not accurate, right? No, the piss wasn't red. I think it's the saline

1518
05:32:19,200 --> 05:32:21,919
No, you guys have fucking up this whole story. Hold on. Let me

1519
05:32:22,720 --> 05:32:28,159
I bought water. Okay, this is we're playing a game of telephone and i'm the only one talking

1520
05:32:29,000 --> 05:32:33,340
How are you guys miss construing this I got water quality test strips

1521
05:32:34,830 --> 05:32:42,720
I peed on one the one that I pissed on said there was lead. It was huge bright red like alarm lead

1522
05:33:00,330 --> 05:33:05,869
Hold on. Give me a second. We'll go over this

1523
05:33:17,930 --> 05:33:20,090
One sec. All right. Hold on actually give me one second

05:33:34,810 --> 05:33:45,180
Is this weird that i'm doing this and showing this to you probably hold on I need to like upload them

1526
05:33:45,340 --> 05:33:58,650
Hold on. Is there any piss in the image? No, there's no piss in the image

1527
05:34:02,650 --> 05:34:07,520
All right. I got them uploaded and by uploaded it means uh, okay

1531
05:34:46,400 --> 05:34:54,110
blur it out

1532
05:34:54,110 --> 05:34:55,630
You should then tweet it then

1533
05:34:55,630 --> 05:34:59,549
Well, I get banned on twitch if I tweet out a picture that I something that I pissed on

1534
05:35:01,580 --> 05:35:05,869
I don't know. I'm concerned about that. That's freaking me out

1535
05:35:09,099 --> 05:35:10,060
anyways

1536
05:35:10,060 --> 05:35:17,950
Uh, maybe i'll tweet it. Maybe i'll tweet it later draw a diagram show us you're a coward

1537
05:35:18,909 --> 05:35:22,590
I'm a i'm a guy that wants to keep his twitch channel intact

1538
05:35:24,880 --> 05:35:28,650
Maybe i'll ask somebody at twitch. That's kind of a weird email

1539
05:35:29,290 --> 05:35:32,889
Hey, I pissed on like a water quality test strip and it's this p all over the image

1540
05:35:32,970 --> 05:35:34,970
Can I show like a piss thing that I did?

1541
05:35:37,069 --> 05:35:40,540
And by the way, take a look at the fucking twitch servers if you could

1542
05:35:41,099 --> 05:35:54,490
But yeah, no, I pissed on one for real and it said that my lead was off the charts

1543
05:35:55,049 --> 05:36:05,979
I need to yeah, where's that fountain? Is the fountain right? What's this?

1544
05:36:08,000 --> 05:36:17,869
Dude, shut up. This is gross

1545
05:36:17,869 --> 05:36:20,360
Yeah, it's it's heart container

1546
05:36:20,919 --> 05:36:29,790
That's definitely something to worry about

1547
05:36:29,790 --> 05:36:31,790
I I mean i'm kind of fucking around because

1548
05:36:32,880 --> 05:36:37,040
I've had my piss tested from a doctor within the last month or two

1549
05:36:39,180 --> 05:36:41,659
You know, right like I peed into a cup in the last month

1550
05:36:46,250 --> 05:36:57,099
By the way, my water has been tested. There's no lead in it. That's why I got the strips. Nice

1551
05:37:11,790 --> 05:37:14,700
Okay, where's that fountain?

1552
05:37:14,700 --> 05:37:16,939
Do they test it for lead?

1553
05:37:16,939 --> 05:37:19,229
I don't know, man

1554
05:37:19,229 --> 05:37:22,990
I mean nothing. I'm not there's no source of lead that i'm being exposed to

1555
05:37:23,790 --> 05:37:25,790
My water's been tested. There's no lead

1556
05:37:27,630 --> 05:37:29,630

1563
05:37:55,229 --> 05:38:00,110
This is for a joke for fun. I just thought it would be funny and it turns out this is shit a little lead in my pee

1564
05:38:01,389 --> 05:38:04,430
Um, I could be like, I don't know if it's false positive or I don't know what it means

1565
05:38:05,069 --> 05:38:06,110
but

1566
05:38:06,110 --> 05:38:07,069
um

1567
05:38:07,069 --> 05:38:10,270
It's all right

1568
05:38:10,270 --> 05:38:15,979
All right. Can I cook?

1569
05:38:15,979 --> 05:38:21,400
All right. So this is uh, all right this and monster parts. Do I have any monster parts? Yes

1570
05:38:22,330 --> 05:38:24,330
All right, so this would give me a cool, uh

1571
05:38:24,330 --> 05:38:31,119
potion, right

1572
05:38:31,119 --> 05:38:43,159
What I thought it said it heightens your senses so you can move about so I thought

1573
05:38:43,560 --> 05:38:48,970
I thought it meant it was like a sneak potion or something. All right, let's make some apples

1574
05:38:49,529 --> 05:39:24,650
Do you have the 1987 garfield mug? It could be related to lead. No, I don't have the 1987 garfield mug

1575
05:39:25,369 --> 05:39:27,290
That has lead paint

1576
05:39:27,290 --> 05:39:28,889
Is that real?

1577
05:39:28,889 --> 05:39:37,159
Yeah, somebody just said dude those things are tested for water not urine. You're fine

1578
05:39:39,880 --> 05:39:42,909
Imagine going to the doctor being like hey doc

1579
05:39:44,459 --> 05:39:50,060
Yeah, I just like i'm just coming in today virgin care because I see I peed on a water test strip as a joke

And yeah here I brought it in see and it says I got lead in my pee

1581
05:39:58,490 --> 05:40:00,810
I'm just thinking maybe I could get like a real lead test

1582
05:40:03,479 --> 05:40:08,220
That's when you get one of these

1583
05:40:08,220 --> 05:40:10,799
iced

1584
05:40:10,799 --> 05:40:11,840
Okay

05:40:11,840 --> 05:40:14,590
Sure. We'll test you for lead

1586
05:40:14,650 --> 05:40:19,290
Jesus and then he's like good and he turns around and he closes the door fucking

1587
05:40:20,490 --> 05:40:22,409
hard behind him

1588
05:40:22,409 --> 05:40:24,970
He closes the door fucking hard. It's like

1589
05:40:32,700 --> 05:40:39,869
All right, where's the

1590
05:40:39,869 --> 05:40:41,869
They're getting big. Ooh, this is cool

1591
05:40:44,409 --> 05:40:45,930
Where's the fountain?

1592
05:40:45,930 --> 05:40:57,389
There's two shrines in the fountain. I gotta go so far away. Where's the fountain fountain fountain store in

1593
05:40:58,720 --> 05:41:02,919
Ooh, I want to go there

1594
05:41:02,919 --> 05:41:05,080
If I can get this stupid nintendo switch shirt off

1595
05:41:05,799 --> 05:41:16,599
I mean, it's not stupid. Switch is a great console

1596
05:41:17,240 --> 05:41:27,259
What do you got? God go cheese is so disgusting

1597
05:41:27,819 --> 05:41:43,900
Okay, larry collection, okay, I want to how do I buy it

1598
05:41:45,419 --> 05:41:50,700
Don't just walk up to it. Ooh hood. I'm like 17 bucks

1599
05:41:57,500 --> 05:41:58,540
Can I sell

1600
05:41:58,540 --> 05:42:09,549
Don't really have anything. I can't really sell anything

1601
05:42:10,189 --> 05:42:12,430
I could sell some opals and shit, right?

1602
05:42:14,990 --> 05:42:18,750
You just don't like anything that doesn't have the most basic flavor profile. I love fish. I love

1603
05:42:19,369 --> 05:42:21,040
salmon

1604
05:42:21,040 --> 05:42:22,799
bass trout

1605
05:42:22,799 --> 05:42:24,799
You guys don't know the basic flavor profiles

1606
05:42:25,439 --> 05:42:28,490
I'm a huge fan of

1607
05:42:28,490 --> 05:42:30,009
tuna fish

1608
05:42:30,009 --> 05:42:32,560
I got that tuna steak

1609
05:42:32,720 --> 05:42:38,560
Basic how basic is it's like as like a sea bass flavor. What are you talking about? I actually hate sea bass. I'm just pretending

1610
05:42:39,549 --> 05:42:45,500
Um, I love tuna though

1611
05:42:45,500 --> 05:42:52,330
I can't afford anything

1612
05:42:52,330 --> 05:42:58,169
Basic flavor profiles. No, i'm sorry. I just don't think that like hey this flavor this flavor profile is crazy and weird

1613
05:42:58,250 --> 05:43:02,400
Therefore I should eat it

1614
05:43:02,400 --> 05:43:04,400
You have the diet of a brown bear

1615
05:43:11,360 --> 05:43:13,470
and

1616
05:43:13,470 --> 05:43:15,470
one of the strongest most feared

1617
05:43:16,110 --> 05:43:21,549
Creatures on the planet hyper intelligent hyper strong and

1618
05:43:22,759 --> 05:43:27,099
Yeah, what's your problem then who eats goat cheese?

1619
05:43:29,279 --> 05:43:32,360
goat cheese

1620
05:43:32,360 --> 05:43:36,759
Name me an animal animal kingdom of these goat cheese and how strong are they?

1621
05:43:41,580 --> 05:43:46,779
Oh the bear with the yeah the bear with the fucking monocle with his goat cheese and caviar. Oh, yes

1622
05:43:49,659 --> 05:43:53,500
What are you talking about

1623
05:43:53,580 --> 05:43:55,580
meat potatoes

1624
05:43:56,810 --> 05:44:03,150
Lettuce and fucking gravy

1625
05:44:03,229 --> 05:44:05,180
spinach

Great

1637
05:45:35,919 --> 05:45:40,159
I hear there's a great fairy fountain somewhere near this village. I hear it's breathed. Where is it then?

1638
05:45:44,939 --> 05:45:46,939
Now if it was an outsider like me to begin

1639
05:45:48,299 --> 05:45:50,380

05:45:56,200 --> 05:45:59,319
I'm stuck in non-sequitur. Andy. Like I gotta get out of this

1642
05:46:04,759 --> 05:46:09,259
Near the village

1643
05:46:09,259 --> 05:46:26,090
It's probably over here. Wasn't the the shrine where's my horse? It's the lead

1644
05:46:33,580 --> 05:46:42,479

1645
05:46:42,479 --> 05:46:44,650

My precious cuckoos

1648
05:46:48,409 --> 05:46:50,009
They haven't come home yet

1649
05:46:50,009 --> 05:46:54,990
Okay, what do I do?

1650
05:46:57,099 --> 05:46:59,900
I'm not doing that. I don't care. I'm gonna get like 50 dollars. I don't want it

1651
05:47:00,619 --> 05:47:04,159
It's the 1987 garfield mug

1652
05:47:04,880 --> 05:47:08,680
Pass the shrine up the hill in the forest. Oh, thank you

1653
05:47:11,549 --> 05:47:13,709
Pass the shrine up the hill in the forest

1654
05:47:15,209 --> 05:47:17,209
So you mean like in here?

Is there any backseat enforcement? Um, I just I I have to get out of this non-sequitur andy thing

1660
05:47:46,889 --> 05:47:49,610
And um, I just just tell me where to go like for the next two

1661
05:47:50,330 --> 05:47:52,490
This horse doesn't want to walk in the right direction

1662
05:47:53,450 --> 05:48:12,090
Am I going the right way?

1663
05:48:12,090 --> 05:48:21,770
Up here into the left. The horse controls are so ridiculous. This is so hard

1664
05:48:22,729 --> 05:48:24,810
It's gonna take a lot of getting used to you can't turn

1665
05:48:26,090 --> 05:48:37,369
it's

1666
05:48:37,369 --> 05:48:44,619
I could have walked by now other way other way up the hill

1668
05:48:49,419 --> 05:48:50,459

1670
05:48:51,819 --> 05:48:53,500
No wrong way

1671
05:48:53,500 --> 05:49:12,459

1672
05:49:16,919 --> 05:49:24,459

1673
05:49:24,459 --> 05:49:26,720

1681
05:50:11,580 --> 05:50:13,099
Into the forest?

1682
05:50:13,099 --> 05:50:17,580
Oh shit

1683
05:50:18,540 --> 05:50:24,540
Oh, this is bad. This is bad. This is bad. This is bad. This is bad. This is bad. This is bad

1684
05:50:25,340 --> 05:50:28,619
Um, I think we're in trouble. I think we're in trouble

1685
05:50:31,560 --> 05:50:40,970

1690
05:51:26,040 --> 05:51:27,639
And just running

1691
05:51:27,639 --> 05:51:36,650
Okay

1692
05:51:36,650 --> 05:51:43,360

1693
05:51:43,360 --> 05:51:46,810
So what what do we got here?

1694
05:51:46,810 --> 05:51:47,689
Okay

1695
05:51:47,689 --> 05:51:50,639
There's a ball somewhere

1696
05:52:01,430 --> 05:52:08,299
Legendary owl

1697
05:52:08,299 --> 05:52:11,959

I'm not getting any beeps from my thing

1701
05:52:44,939 --> 05:52:49,020
There are two shrines like down in the fountain under the fairy fountain

1702
05:52:49,979 --> 05:53:03,610
Is that one down there? Is that it right there?

1703
05:53:06,009 --> 05:53:10,299
That's it right there, right? Yeah, that's it

1704
05:53:32,669 --> 05:53:35,520
um

1705
05:53:35,520 --> 05:53:37,759
A lot of stuff here. That's not a

1706
05:53:41,770 --> 05:53:43,919
Endura carrot

1707
05:53:43,919 --> 05:53:49,229

1708
05:53:49,229 --> 05:53:51,790
Silent princess, okay

A lot of materials over here

1710
05:53:57,709 --> 05:54:05,040
Can you catch the fairy?

1711
05:54:05,040 --> 05:54:07,919
What is this?

1712
05:54:07,919 --> 05:54:09,439
Boy, sweet boy

1713
05:54:09,439 --> 05:54:16,400
Please listen to my story. I am the great fairy cotera

1714
05:54:17,200 --> 05:54:19,200
This place was once a beautiful spring

1715
05:54:19,599 --> 05:54:22,959
But as time passed fewer and fewer travelers arrived to offer me rupees

1716
05:54:23,770 --> 05:54:27,130
As a result, my power has abandoned me. I'm nearly powerless now

1717
05:54:27,770 --> 05:54:29,529
I need rupees

1718
05:54:29,529 --> 05:54:42,720
All I need is a hundred rupees. I don't have any that is tragic

1719
05:54:43,360 --> 05:54:46,360
I need to mark this on the map

1720
05:54:50,319 --> 05:54:52,319
Uh, i'm gonna say

1721
05:54:52,400 --> 05:54:55,880
Is it a person?

1722
05:54:55,880 --> 05:55:01,819
Okay

1723
05:55:01,819 --> 05:55:03,819
Where is that shrine?

1724
05:55:10,430 --> 05:55:18,330
Pay her sell the gems. I don't have 17 rupees guys. What are you talking about?

1725
05:55:29,319 --> 05:55:33,119
I don't know if it's okay. I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can do it

1726
05:55:36,119 --> 05:55:37,720
I gotta head this way though

1727
05:55:37,720 --> 05:55:40,779
I'm gonna fast travel to here. I'm gonna go this way

1728
05:55:42,040 --> 05:55:45,119
That feels like the safest place to go

1729
05:55:45,119 --> 05:55:51,099
You're a quitter sell everything sell stuff. Oh my goodness fine. Is it worth it?

1730
05:55:51,740 --> 05:55:54,080
Is it actually worth it?

1731
05:55:54,080 --> 05:56:12,409

05:56:12,409 --> 05:56:21,500

06:15:00,139 --> 06:15:05,180
Yeah, let's go

1815
06:15:05,180 --> 06:15:15,529
Ancient stuff should I be collecting as many of these as I can or is this a waste of time?

1816
06:15:20,439 --> 06:15:21,720
Yes, okay

1817
06:15:21,720 --> 06:15:24,349
So it's worth getting all these

1818
06:15:31,000 --> 06:15:42,720
Very worth it. Okay a lot. They're extremely useful. All right

Probably talking about goat cheese and shit pissing everybody off

1823
06:16:23,840 --> 06:16:25,840
Are you mad at me that I don't like goat cheese?

1824
06:16:26,000 --> 06:16:29,319

Yeah, I think that's possible for me. Nope

1828
06:16:46,750 --> 06:16:48,590
All right, I need a tower

06:16:48,590 --> 06:16:55,560
Or this is far away cook those carrots

1830
06:16:58,119 --> 06:17:01,000
I should cook a lot of things that I have right? Okay

1831
06:17:05,479 --> 06:17:07,799
Cook it cook with it to increase your stealth

1832
06:17:08,599 --> 06:17:10,680
Um like this could I do like this?

1833
06:17:16,520 --> 06:17:19,290
What happens if I do that?

1834
06:17:19,290 --> 06:17:20,650
carrots and

1835
06:17:20,650 --> 06:17:26,029
flowers

1836
06:17:26,029 --> 06:17:27,790
fried wild greens

1837
06:17:27,790 --> 06:17:30,540
Cool. No

1838
06:17:31,180 --> 06:17:37,520
Oh, what if I do this?

1839
06:17:45,659 --> 06:17:51,360
Sneaky fried wild greens cool. So wait

1840
06:17:51,680 --> 06:17:57,979
What if I do this? This would be interesting. Can I just make like a super huge potion?

1841
06:17:58,540 --> 06:18:07,360
Like 10. Oh, that's 10 minutes. All right, that's cool

1842
06:18:08,159 --> 06:18:12,330
So I get it

1843
06:18:12,330 --> 06:18:13,369
very cool

1844
06:18:13,369 --> 06:18:17,069
so if I do a mushroom

1845
06:18:17,069 --> 06:18:18,509
and this

1846
06:18:18,509 --> 06:18:20,830
then i'll have food that heals me and

1847
06:18:22,139 --> 06:18:27,680
Gives me stealth

1848
06:18:27,680 --> 06:18:55,549
Right sneaky steamed mushrooms. I got it get it. That's really cool. I like it. You don't like feta. I do like feta

1849
06:18:55,950 --> 06:19:08,200
That is not goat cheese. It has a completely different flavor profile. It's sheep

1850
06:19:10,110 --> 06:19:12,830
It's sheep cheese. I did that sheep is not a goat

1851
06:19:14,720 --> 06:19:18,319
The sheep is not a goat. Do you need what do we need to go over the animals again?

1852
06:19:19,389 --> 06:19:22,400
A is for alligator B is for

1853
06:19:23,119 --> 06:19:27,529
Bear S is for sheep G is for goat

1854
06:19:33,659 --> 06:19:35,419
That was mean

1855
06:19:35,419 --> 06:20:03,689
Are you playing on switch or pc? This is not on pc. It's on switch, right? Yeah, it's only on nintendo

1856
06:20:06,990 --> 06:20:09,740
Point of interest. What's this?

1857
06:20:10,380 --> 06:20:31,740
Kind of got hit once. Is it an emulator?

1858
06:20:46,889 --> 06:20:51,360
Um, I can sleep in here. Is there a chest or anything?

1859
06:20:51,840 --> 06:20:54,439
What is diary?

1860
06:20:54,439 --> 06:21:02,299
Ancient text when a dark light resides in the cursed statue's eyes pierce its gaze to purge the seal from the shrine

1861
06:21:02,459 --> 06:21:15,799
Good to know the reason to use an emulator is for 4k 60 fps texture packs

1862
06:21:32,889 --> 06:21:38,110
Okay, let me guess you caught one of the great dr

1863
06:21:38,169 --> 06:21:43,610
Calypso's groundbreaking research and just had to meet him for yourself. Huh? No, don't tell me you never heard of me

1864
06:21:43,849 --> 06:21:59,000
I have not I use an emulator bat chest. I'm just playing the game on switch. Okay

1865
06:22:00,119 --> 06:22:04,840
Dr. Calyp if you please I didn't study my rear end off to be called. Mr. Calyp

1866
06:22:05,319 --> 06:22:09,419
Everyone forgets i'm a doctor for some reason

1867
06:22:09,659 --> 06:22:16,459
And since you asked i'll inform you that i'm engaged in analyzing ancient texts. I've been time for idle chit chat

1868
06:22:30,360 --> 06:22:40,400

1869
06:22:51,919 --> 06:23:06,569

She texts me

1874
06:23:17,770 --> 06:23:42,599
And I use that as a chat

1875
06:23:42,599 --> 06:23:51,439
Yeah, let's go

1876
06:23:51,759 --> 06:23:55,610
What's the last thing she said?

1877
06:23:55,610 --> 06:23:57,790
Don't listen to them, sweetheart

1878
06:23:57,849 --> 06:24:00,349
McDonald's is delicious. We're a mcdonald's family

1879
06:24:01,150 --> 06:24:08,380
All the way through I never used to cook with goat cheese because it was disgusting cheddar cheese where it's at

1880
06:24:08,939 --> 06:24:13,580
Love mom. Yeah

1881
06:24:13,580 --> 06:24:16,700

06:24:17,580 --> 06:24:26,119
Yeah, they're like

1883
06:24:26,119 --> 06:24:28,520
30 to 40 minutes apart each one like six times

1884
06:24:32,810 --> 06:24:34,810
Okay, so uh, yeah

1885
06:24:34,889 --> 06:25:02,729
If I don't have a bow equipped why not dude if I if I was an adventurer I definitely would use a bow 100

1886
06:25:15,340 --> 06:25:53,209
What if you get attacked up close good luck. Oh shit. Here we go. He's making noises

1887
06:25:58,669 --> 06:26:23,529
Uh, what is over here? Are you gonna wrap this stream up? It's god damn. I almost drowned. Okay

1888
06:26:25,790 --> 06:26:27,790
Uh, uh, maybe like another half hour

1889
06:26:27,790 --> 06:26:35,369
I'm still good

1890
06:26:35,369 --> 06:26:52,220
Seven hours or so maybe seven and a half hours something like that. You're addicted. It's a good. It's a fun game

1891
06:26:53,689 --> 06:26:56,009
It's genuinely a fun game. It's very nice

1892
06:27:00,509 --> 06:27:15,529
What's that

1893
06:27:15,529 --> 06:27:19,229
Oh, it's an acorn

1894
06:27:19,229 --> 06:27:26,110
You said that yesterday and I left and you stream for another nine hours. Yeah, that was a rare occasion though

1895
06:27:28,189 --> 06:27:35,639
Where's the tower here?

1896
06:27:35,639 --> 06:27:37,639
Uh, i'm gonna keep wandering this way

1897
06:27:41,979 --> 06:27:50,009
Oh, hi, you should join the yiga clan. You don't know. I mean I do know

1898
06:27:52,490 --> 06:27:55,049
Brave group of warriors founded by master

1899
06:27:55,529 --> 06:28:50,889
Koga and dedicated defending a hero throughout long. Why I didn't hit family guy death pose

1900
06:28:51,290 --> 06:29:07,849
I should have just fought that was weird. I thought I could just boom just blow them crazy

1901
06:29:07,930 --> 06:29:15,770
They fly and you know, I guess you can't is that just a random occurrence? That's pretty cool

1902
06:29:16,330 --> 06:29:32,270
I just missed. Yeah, I felt like it could have hit though

1903
06:29:35,849 --> 06:29:56,560
Right on top of it. Your skin suit looks accurate to a human today. Thanks

1904
06:29:57,439 --> 06:30:06,720
No, never mind. I'm not gonna do that weird

1905
06:30:29,240 --> 06:30:50,830
Take what was on that? That was a bug. Oh, hold on. Hell. Yeah more amber. You should buy the broadcasting rights to family guy

1906
06:30:53,119 --> 06:30:55,119
Uh, that would be nice to hit up

1907
06:30:55,919 --> 06:30:57,400
Box

1908
06:30:57,400 --> 06:31:01,159
And see whether you know the 10 to 25 million dollars I probably would need

1909
06:31:02,349 --> 06:31:13,919
For like a month

1910
06:31:13,919 --> 06:31:27,099
Oh, I can't carry any more melee weapons. I have a lot of these claim wars. I'll just get rid of it

1911
06:31:27,659 --> 06:31:33,080
Uh, that thing's 18 damage 16 damage

1912
06:31:51,119 --> 06:32:10,540

1913
06:32:10,540 --> 06:32:33,500
Back swing hit me and killed me in one hit guys. Is that somebody on a horse?

1914
06:33:02,700 --> 06:33:21,310
Oh my goodness, there's a lot of them. What are they all attacking? Holy shit that guy went

1915
06:33:25,340 --> 06:33:28,540
I'm doing dark souls controls. I keep on hitting right stick to try to lock on

1916
06:34:10,279 --> 06:34:17,930
These guys are way higher level than me. Oh my god. I'm just fucking running. What's the point help?

1917
06:34:19,450 --> 06:34:20,889
What's happening

1918
06:34:20,889 --> 06:34:24,040
Is there stuff on your cart? Do you have stuff on your cart?

1919
06:34:26,119 --> 06:34:35,099
What the fuck is going on? This isn't supposed to be hard. You die in one swing. What do you mean?

1920
06:34:35,099 --> 06:34:39,560
It's not hard. Okay, I die in one hit with my nintendo switch

1921
06:34:40,419 --> 06:35:16,880
Polyester t-shirt on oh he took care of it. No, I didn't they telegraph for two seconds. I'm

1922
06:35:17,680 --> 06:35:19,680
Do I die in one hit?

1923
06:35:21,599 --> 06:35:30,650
This character sucks. I'm trying to dodge it and do the fucking parry thing

1924
06:35:42,409 --> 06:35:47,180
I'm trying to do the flurry dodge. Whatever. I have a better idea

1925
06:35:49,529 --> 06:35:52,490
Go put on something that is made out of anything besides

1926
06:35:53,849 --> 06:35:55,930
Like something that I got it fucking old navy

1927
06:36:04,880 --> 06:36:21,159
Goodbye fuck out of here

1928
06:36:43,069 --> 06:37:03,439
Let's go

1929
06:37:03,439 --> 06:37:12,080
Get the tower. Yeah, where where is it? I'm trying to look wait. Let me climb up here and see if I can see it

1930
06:37:12,080 --> 06:37:14,040
I'm up here

1931
06:37:14,040 --> 06:37:15,639
Oh

1932
06:37:15,639 --> 06:37:33,040
Okay, i'm not gonna glide

1933
06:37:33,439 --> 06:37:42,720
I would not have made it

1934
06:37:42,720 --> 06:37:53,279
Do you enjoy the scenery? It's beautiful. The 30 fps is not a big deal. It's doable. It's workable. It's fine. I think it's fine

1935
06:38:00,080 --> 06:38:04,490
Who's the sniff guy?

1936
06:38:23,529 --> 06:38:49,950

06:38:49,950 --> 06:38:58,540
slide

1938
06:38:58,540 --> 06:39:00,540
That guy was a lot scarier than he

1939
06:39:00,939 --> 06:39:31,209
Okay

1940
06:39:31,209 --> 06:39:57,400
Moblin fang moblin horn. Okay moblin. I don't know. I don't care pink got you. Oh, you have a weapon

No

1943
06:40:41,209 --> 06:41:19,869
I can definitely do it. Just stop jumping

1944
06:41:23,709 --> 06:41:28,990
Hang out up here for a sec. I should be able to stand on this, right?

1945
06:41:29,150 --> 06:41:37,290
I don't I I don't have to go around. I bet you I can stand up here right there

1946
06:41:37,610 --> 06:42:25,130
Come on. I have to go all the way around. I just should have died

1947
06:42:25,450 --> 06:42:32,240
I probably would have ended up up there again. All right, I think I can get this here we go

1948
06:42:34,110 --> 06:42:51,979
Don't do the jump thing. That'd be fine. Yeah, I can definitely make it from here. Oh my god. That's a lot

1949
06:42:52,220 --> 06:43:10,000
Oh shit. Nice. Okay, so from wait, hold on

1950
06:43:10,970 --> 06:43:16,330
So from here, I should be able to stand on top of this and go up from here

1951
06:43:25,869 --> 06:43:48,889
I think I got it straight up. No jumping. We stand right up there. I just hope so right on this lip

1952
06:43:49,130 --> 06:44:16,619
I don't think so for a sec. All right, got my fucking gold by the way sapphire

06:44:49,080 --> 06:44:50,360
Ooh

1955
06:44:50,360 --> 06:45:12,360
What octoballoons and bass cool? Okay. Let me get my bearings and see where I am a little hut right here

1956
06:45:14,220 --> 06:45:20,439
I need to get back over there. Let me check the house

1957
06:45:43,930 --> 06:45:50,889
10 arrows actually really useful. All right

1958
06:45:52,169 --> 06:45:56,889
I'm so screwed though. I need to somehow get back up the whole mountain

1959
06:45:57,130 --> 06:46:16,959
Is this I could probably teleport and then go again. What would this be for?

1960
06:46:17,759 --> 06:46:23,069
What's what is this for?

1961
06:46:23,450 --> 06:46:26,729
Wouldn't just be here for no reason. I have to set it back in the slot

1962
06:46:46,680 --> 06:46:50,729
Oh, I found another um seed monster

1963
06:46:50,729 --> 06:47:37,849
Fear a little guy's got no fear. I have to go all the way around right that sucks wouldn't mop

1964
06:47:53,310 --> 06:47:55,310
Wow, I just died to a mop

1965
06:48:21,599 --> 06:48:49,919
All right, I gotta start using the better weapons I need a shield things way better what an actual item

1966
06:48:50,319 --> 06:48:53,520
It's not like the the handle of a fridge

1967
06:48:55,659 --> 06:49:22,250
Or a tire iron

1968
06:49:22,250 --> 06:49:30,250
Pure offense. Yeah

1969
06:49:30,250 --> 06:49:35,040
These guys do so much the huge guys don't do that much damage

1970
06:49:36,970 --> 06:49:37,930
those

1971
06:49:37,930 --> 06:49:39,290
the blue

1972
06:49:39,290 --> 06:49:59,119
Um trolls, whatever they are. They they do so much damage. Where did I end up? Okay, let me just the horse

1973
06:50:03,709 --> 06:50:06,430
I'm just going up that way and i'm gonna go turn the thing on

1974
06:50:15,040 --> 06:50:18,220
I'll come back and explore this later

1975
06:50:18,220 --> 06:50:23,900
I need armor

1976
06:50:23,900 --> 06:50:27,419
See that did one quarter of a heart not my entire health pool

1977
06:50:28,139 --> 06:50:46,750
Stupid. All right, let's go wrap around and turn the thing on

1978
06:50:52,590 --> 06:50:58,590
Where is it? I lost it these things tower over the whole horizon. Why can I not see it?

1979
06:51:02,090 --> 06:51:04,169
I gotta go around here to the right

1980
06:51:05,849 --> 06:51:07,849
And just i'm only going for that

1981
06:51:12,319 --> 06:51:16,509
And then when I get up there, that's i'm gonna probably gonna call it. It's a solid seven hours

1982
06:51:21,450 --> 06:51:23,450
This is great though. This is a good game

1983
06:51:23,450 --> 06:51:25,950
We will definitely continue playing breath of the wild

1984
06:51:46,040 --> 06:51:51,180
Yeah, definitely. What's the average time to take to beat it?

1985
06:51:52,060 --> 06:51:54,299
This could just turn into the elden ring

1986
06:51:54,619 --> 06:51:58,139
Right where I just play I just play it every other day or something like that

1987
06:51:58,700 --> 06:52:01,840
Probably like about 100 hours

1988
06:52:02,400 --> 06:52:10,119
Oh

1989
06:52:18,110 --> 06:52:19,950
Oh, no

1990
06:52:19,950 --> 06:52:21,950
He threw a bomb

1991
06:52:22,189 --> 06:52:24,189
Okay. Thank god. It didn't directly hit me

1992
06:52:35,610 --> 06:52:38,090
Oh my god, get me the fuck out of here

1993
06:52:38,889 --> 06:52:45,549
That's a bow. I don't what's that boat brennic bow. Cool

1994
06:53:50,590 --> 06:53:55,520
The chest over here too, uh, how do I get up there and I climb the tree

1995
06:53:55,520 --> 06:54:13,310
Okay

1996
06:54:13,310 --> 06:54:19,680
No ladder as it glides from there from the yeah pretty far away

1997
06:54:29,200 --> 06:54:32,060
Uh, i'll go from the top. It makes more sense, right?

1998
06:54:41,709 --> 06:54:56,959
All right. What do you got in here? Ten arrows. I'll take it. All right now we gotta go

1999
06:54:59,639 --> 06:55:12,009
That way geez, how am I gonna hopefully I can get up here this way. Can you come to my birthday party?

2000
06:55:13,520 --> 06:55:17,040
Um, I don't think I can come to your birthday party. I can I can say happy birthday

2001
06:55:17,759 --> 06:55:19,360

2002
06:55:19,360 --> 06:55:37,200
Whenever it is

One two, three, four five six seven

06:56:13,950 --> 06:56:22,439
Scary tree don't if I died in the thorns

2005
06:56:23,849 --> 06:56:26,009
You could revoke my gaming license. Seriously

2006
06:56:26,729 --> 06:56:41,200
What's my opinion on greek yogurt? Um, it's it

2007
06:56:54,909 --> 06:56:59,400
It sucks. I'm not a big fan. I think it's gross

I landed it right on my neck

2014
06:57:55,470 --> 06:58:44,939
Almost there. You're doing good. Oh, this this game is just fun to play. All right now we can jump

2015
06:58:58,590 --> 06:59:06,439
Let go let go. That was bad. Do not jump

2016
06:59:07,400 --> 06:59:14,619
I need a coffee. I do not want to drink a coffee at 11 30 at night. That would be a mistake

2017
06:59:15,099 --> 07:00:01,000
I had one like six seven wait eight hours ago. How am I gonna get over this same exact fucking thing?

2018
07:00:02,520 --> 07:00:04,680
Should I I don't understand should I try the other side?

2019
07:00:07,080 --> 07:00:44,189

2020
07:01:03,049 --> 07:01:08,400
Rises to its peak under the hour of the hour of the blood moon

2021
07:01:09,840 --> 07:01:15,680
Aimless spirits of monsters slain in the name of the light return to flesh

2022
07:01:17,319 --> 07:01:19,560
It's a good thing. I'm a thousand feet above everything

2023
07:01:23,880 --> 07:01:26,189
I don't give a shit. I'm out. Look where I am

2024
07:01:26,189 --> 07:01:31,720
I'm protected up here. Why would I be concerned about that? I'm

2025
07:01:32,819 --> 07:01:48,380
2000 feet above sea level

2026
07:01:48,380 --> 07:01:50,459

You see what happened from like 7 30 to like 8 15 pacific

2055
07:06:05,209 --> 07:06:09,849
It was all over the place, but it's been perfect for the last two or three hours. I don't get it
