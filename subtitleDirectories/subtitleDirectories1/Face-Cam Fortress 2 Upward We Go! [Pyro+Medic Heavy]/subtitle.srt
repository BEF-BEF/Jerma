00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:10,570
Hey, what is going on, everybody?

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:21,609

3
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:25,769
Hope you're having a fantastic Saturday afternoon.

4
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,129
Cause it's Saturday afternoon, and your eyes are the size of the moon.

5
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:33,530
That's not the lyrics of that song.

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,009
But, what was that group's name?

7
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,299
Oh, god, they're the ones that were...

8
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:46,049
Like, what is, I can't...

9
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:47,390
Panic at the Disco.

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,530
They had, like, two songs that were famous.

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,929
Maybe, even one.

12
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,429
I'm probably thinking of two completely different bands.

13
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,789
Anyways, let's play some Pyro on upward.

14
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:57,950
Upward.

15
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,659

16
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,500
Cause I just wanna play upward.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,920

59
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,550
I don't think we're going to win this

60
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:55,779
Something tells me that this is not gonna care. Oh my god. You have that thing the beggars bazooka

61
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:00,100
Oh get away from me

62
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,300
I used to do that with my chocolate milk and

63
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:16,899
One time I did that and I almost puked all over the dinner table because I like how how is this even happening right now?

64
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll explain why I almost puked in one second. No, don't burn to death on this

65
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,910
This is intense moment here. We got to push this card up. Okay now

66
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,189
I'll tell you so when I was little I used to do that all the time and my brother used to try and make

67
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,189
Me laugh when I did it

68
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:36,860
So one day I think I was like

69
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:45,860
11 or 12 or something. I don't remember but I did this I was going and my brother told a joke and I sucked in as

70
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,019
I was like I was like blowing out and then I went

71
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,300
And I literally almost threw up all over like the turkey dinner we were having it was pretty ridiculous

72
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,750
Okay, guys. Well, I just got back from a crash. Oh my god, and I'm gonna try to play upward again to change sir

73
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,689
Oh my god, dude, how many centuries are up there?

74
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,310
Hold on a second, dude

75
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:16,769
What is good? Why is there but it was three centuries up here. You guys are out of your minds. Oh my god

76
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:25,790
All right, well that's that's the one way to defend a point I don't think unless they

77
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,930
Louise with a piece of cheese

78
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:39,699
So yeah, I just came back from a crash happen sometimes and I record the face cam and the game at the same time

79
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,379
So hopefully it doesn't happen again. Hopefully I get this next few minutes of pure uninterrupted team fortress to goodness

80
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,699
And I changed to the medic and let's do let's get an uber going here. Let's smoke

82
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:09,920

83
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,910
