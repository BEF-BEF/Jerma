1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:15,080
Hey. What's up? I'm sorry. Um, yeah. I told you guys I was gonna be live Thursday and Friday.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:28,969
I did say that. But here we are on Wednesday at 8 20 at night. I couldn't wait. I wasn't gonna wait.

3
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:41,340
I'm sorry. I couldn't. I've had the Elton Ring OST playing since the stream stopped two days ago.

4
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:53,299
And it finished. It's like, yo, I want to play. Right when it got 16 hours,

5
00:00:54,259 --> 00:01:07,849
42 minutes. I was like, I'm turning the stream on now. Playing Elton Ring. I don't know how long

6
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:14,540
this stream is gonna be. I don't. It's not gonna be long. I maybe a few three, four hours. I just

7
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,540
want to play. I want to. And then I'm just like, you know, I want to turn the stream on. Let's go.

8
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:30,790
I wasn't waiting until tomorrow. I couldn't. Is it gamer? You said Thursday. I did.

9
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:41,049
But look, let me be fair to me and this channel. I would like a show of hands. How many of you have

10
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:47,049
seen me tell you that a stream is going to be on Thursday and the stream happens on Saturday?

11
00:01:48,390 --> 00:02:00,819
Show of hands, please. Hmm. Seeing a lot of raised hands. I would say that probably happens 70 to 80

12
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:07,500
percent of the time. I'll be like, oh, hey guys, it's Wednesday. Yeah, that's it. That's it for

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,740
this stream. I'll see you guys on Friday. And then like Monday morning, the suss changes being like

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:22,650
Tuesday. So come on. I'm go for the first time in a long time. We are we're doing early suss changes,

15
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,939
not late, not delays. We are releasing the streams early now. Last week or so. So this is a reverse

16
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,719
delay. This is something you're not used to. I know something I'm not used to. But here we are.

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:49,099
Midnight is very early. Well, that's true. I could be for a lot of the EU crowd. It's seven,

18
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:56,009
it's like six, what, five or six o'clock in the morning right now on Thursday. If I stream for

19
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,310
like another, if I stream for like four or five hours tonight, it's, it's, I was early to the

20
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:10,860
stream on Thursday. Just think of it that way. That's it. So we, we're just, I got to be very

21
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:19,020
clear though. We're getting close to some real, I probably wouldn't say real end game stuff.

22
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:30,250
This journey is getting closer to coming to an end. I know there's still a lot to do, but

23
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm getting close. We've received some info last stream that was like, okay, I wonder what that

24
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,050
means. We're in one of the final zones of the game, unless they pull some weird shit here that I

25
00:03:47,050 --> 00:04:00,120
don't know about. So, okay. Let me just give me one quick second while people trickle in.

26
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:46,920
Grab it. We're good. Where's Otto? I will show Otto at the end of the night. He's comfortable.

27
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:55,779
He's not here. He's very comfortable in another room. I will show Otto before the stream turns

28
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:05,079
off. Okay. If I do not show Otto before the stream turns off, and if the three stooges are not added

29
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:17,500
to Fortnite by April 23rd, I will eat a glove on stream. Nobody showed that to me that I, you know,

30
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:27,060
all of you forgot about it, but I made, okay. I made a thing, a bet like a year ago that said that

31
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,779
I was like certain that the three stooges were going to be in Fortnite. Certain of it. Just know

32
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,620
like there has to be, right? There's no way that's not going to happen eventually. Don't you can

33
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:46,459
already see the trailer for it. And they'd be like poking each other in the eyes and shit,

34
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:51,259
and they would be jumping over. It probably will happen, but I might just be too early for it.

35
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:57,180
The three stooges are going to be in Fortnite. I'm, I will die on this hill. The three stooges

36
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,339
will be in Fortnite before, before the game turns off. I'm telling you right now. I'm telling you.

37
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:16,339
Why? Why is everybody else added to the game? Look at the Fortnite roster and you tell me that

38
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:28,629
that's not, the three stooges wouldn't be there. The Fortnite skin roster right now is like the old

39
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:37,899
Smash Brothers pretend leaks. Like Mrs. Deltfire was on it and stuff. Remember back like in 2000,

40
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:50,810
like fucking 10, 2012, whatever it was. When are you going to get added? I'm not getting added

41
00:06:50,810 --> 00:07:00,230
to Fortnite. Three, three stooges are too old news. This is recycled. It's not recycled. It's

42
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,829
a rehash. Okay. It's a rerun. There's a lot of new people here that did not hear that classic

43
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:17,769
material. Anyway, they've removed building from the game. You want, I got a theory for you.

44
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:25,750
So I got a theory. They removed building from Fortnite like a, like an event. I think they're

45
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,389
testing to see if people like the game more with it off. So then they just don't have to ever turn

46
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,910
it back on. They're mick ribbing you guys. Don't you understand? Like they're going to keep doing

47
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:43,689
this. Oh look, no building for like a month. And they're going to keep bringing it back like the

48
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:54,889
mick rib. It's going to happen like once every like six months or so. Game is actually massively

49
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,730
improved without it. But here's the problem. They've never added the mick rib permanently

50
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:11,540
to the menu, have they? That's what you have to look at. I'm, I'm not so sure. As, as popular as

51
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,939
the mick rib is, it's not on the menu permanently. They did it in German Fortnite.

52
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,220
The mick rib is back. Yeah. People will be saying, Oh, building, building is gone again. Look,

53
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,500
the non-building game mode is back and you're all going to download it. You're all going to play it.

54
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,500
The amount of people on my Twitter feed that are going back to Fortnite because the mick rib is back

55
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:52,169
is astounding. So be aware of that. All right. I'm going to play Elden Ring. Let's go.

56
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:07,779
Well, I look cool from it. Oh, this is where we were last. He looks young. It's going to shaved.

57
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,539
I shaved my face and I delete like, well, here's the thing. When I shaved my face,

58
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,809
I, I like lose and gain 10 years. Like I always look like 10 years younger,

59
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:25,929
but I always like somehow look like five years older as well. Because when I shave,

60
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,809
like this part up here gets really much more defined. Do you see like how old my eyes look

61
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:36,470
and shit? Like I actually kind of have like really old looking eyes. This carries the whole

62
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,779
face for me. This is, this will, this carries the entire face. I thought that was a, okay.

63
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:55,860
No game audio. Fuck. Now there is. Yeah. Like from here, damn would I look good in a Batman mask.

64
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:05,029
You understand? Like with the, like with this, like covered, like I would be a great Batman.

65
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:23,059
Your chin's too pointy. I'm that person up for an hour. Not kidding. 10 minutes. All right. So

66
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:34,460
last thing we did, uh, do a Batman voice. Not going to embarrass myself in the first five

67
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,029
minutes of this one. All right. So last thing I did, let's take a look at the map in the menu.

68
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,110
I can go do this, which is the, how am I, how can I still do that?

69
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:51,350
If I already completed that whole area, right? I can, can I actually do this?

70
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:05,750
I want to explore. Okay. Let me, I gotta make, these are marked. Let's just do it. One, two,

71
00:11:06,789 --> 00:11:11,289
I'm going to check this out. I want to, I want to look at this because I want to see from the

72
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:15,909
mountain and I think I'm ready to go. We're on the mountain. This is where we are. Why is this

73
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:24,009
marked? Oh, it's cause it's a, a map thing. All right. So here we go. Uh, we're going to go to

74
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:31,460
this. We're going to go to the left of us right now, which is, uh, how late are you going to

75
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,370
stream? I don't know. We're just going to, I'm just going to play. I've been really, really active

76
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:43,690
in the evening hours lately as the last couple of weeks. And I blame that on my sleep schedule,

77
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,129
kind of getting detonated after the streamer awards. Cause I had like a

78
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:53,259
politis slash proctitis flare up that kind of fucked me up for a little while. Uh,

79
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:58,460
so I'm kind of on a weird schedule at the moment, but I'm awake. I'm alert now. Can I level up?

80
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:11,850
I can shit. All right. What am I going to do? He's a vampire. No, I'm not a vampire.

81
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,860
I couldn't cut it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be cut out to be a vampire. Uh, health.

82
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:29,539
You, okay. Like drinking other people's blood. No, no, I, I don't even want to be, I don't even

83
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:44,019
want to be near anybody else's blood ever. No one tell them. That's what a vampire would say.

84
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:53,509
I don't, that's part, that's a huge part of being a vampire is drinking somebody else's blood.

85
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,139
But it's not something I'm going to do. That's fucking, I don't like it. I don't like, no,

86
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:09,990
I don't like blood. Nope. Werewolf. I would rather be a werewolf a hundred times. Do I have to

87
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,190
actually answer that question? Like vampire, you got me to get to live forever, but you have to

88
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:19,929
drink other people's blood all the time. Werewolf. You get to like change into a werewolf. That's

89
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:24,090
kind of cool. Right? Like I could just be like, I could just hang out as me. And then there's a

90
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,529
full moon. I just like, and I'm looking strong and shit. And like, I'm really powerful and I'm

91
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:36,250
really smart too. And I'm handsome and I have a cool tail. And I, um, I can read it at least

92
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:47,899
11th grade level after I change. All right, let's kill this guy. You got a lot of help.

93
00:13:47,899 --> 00:14:07,740
Oh, it's a lot for you. I get off the horse. These guys, I can fight these guys off the horse.

94
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:24,460
I did not say that. Wait, I have a question. Is a werewolf a furry? Yes. I don't think so.

95
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:55,899
No, I don't think so. I think that's wrong. How much health does he have?

96
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:09,379
Okay. For me, a furry is somebody that is an anthropomorphic animal person. Right? That's kind

97
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:15,620
of what it is. A werewolf is somebody that is like a person that changes into a wolf, like a

98
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,519
wolf person at night. Are there furries that say I'm not a furry unless it's like 11 o'clock at night?

99
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:34,600
That's, that's no. Like, oh, okay. If you asked me if I was like a furry, like at like four o'clock

100
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,059
in the afternoon, I said no. Then like at 10 o'clock at night, you said, are you a furry?

101
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:54,090
And I was like, yeah, dude, that doesn't make any sense. Am I going to use an entire fight to kill

102
00:15:54,090 --> 00:16:01,000
this guy? I'm just saying what is that? What are the rules? I don't know what the rules are.

103
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:29,159
A lot of lock on. Oh, I don't, huh? What are the cat ears? Cat is not a werewolf. Sorry. I like,

104
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:39,419
do I, I'm sorry. I like a cat is not a werewolf. And I don't want to be, okay, let me, let me

105
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:45,100
clarify this too. When I say I turn into a werewolf, like if I was a werewolf, it's not like,

106
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,860
oh, I'm just, I kind of like get a little taller and I get some like scruff and I have ears now.

107
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,740
No, like I'm going to be like a gnarled like fucking monster. You know what I mean? Like we

108
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:09,220
get fucked up looking like terrifying, awful looking like we had hunched like spine like,

109
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,940
like I'm not, I don't, I'm not going to be handsome looking. Let me be really clear about that.

110
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:29,269
Is that, did he drop anything? No, like a bloodborne werewolf. Yes. That is exactly what

111
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm talking about. They're terrifying. Like when you turn into a werewolf, it's not like, oh, I,

112
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,920
my like shoulders get a little more broad and my like chin gets more defined. And I get a little

113
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,920
snout and ears. And I like, oh, look at me though. I'm still, I'm looking at how handsome I am. No,

114
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:58,279
no, no. I want to be one of the werewolves from fucking bloodborne. Where am I going? I don't

115
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:10,380
want to be able to talk. Right. Cause to me, that's a werewolf. Like I don't want to change into this

116
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,720
werewolf at night. Like, no. Okay. Um, let me think. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, right? Like you,

117
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,200
Mr. Hyde, you didn't want Mr. Hyde. Like, but at like midnight, Mr. Hyde was going to come out if

118
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,339
he ate food after midnight. That's the gremlins. Um, who's the werewolf? What am I, what werewolf,

119
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:43,019
what werewolf am I talking about? I know it's the fucking gremlins. I'm not like other furries.

120
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,460
Okay. Well, I didn't want to look at this. So I'm here. I'm not like other, I'm not, I'm just

121
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,220
saying I would rather, this all stemmed because somebody said, would you rather be a werewolf

122
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,660
for a vampire? And I don't like the idea of drinking blood. So I would rather be a werewolf.

123
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,319
But wait, werewolves, do werewolves eat people? I would still have to consume blood because I

124
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:38,099
would be eating people. This whole thing got fucked up because I don't, I didn't think,

125
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:59,559
I didn't think this was really that bad. Greedy. Oh my God. These guys die in one hit. Oh fuck.

126
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:19,779
That guy needs to die right now. I don't know why I didn't think he was the same insane greedy.

127
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:33,500
Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Why can't I fucking dodge this guy? It's because this little dickhead

128
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,670
is right next to him and it's like fucking up my timings. You were dead already like an hour ago,

129
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:48,700
it seems. Why do I feel like this baby rattle lost 80% of its range overnight? What the fuck

130
00:20:48,700 --> 00:21:10,740
is going on here? Yeah. I cannot step. You are the stupidest fucking enemy in the goddamn game.

131
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:25,240
Die already. I just used eight potions. His face is red. It's always red. Don't make the werewolf

132
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:33,000
come out. Yeah, don't feed me after midnight. When I get angry, I turn into a werewolf. It's

133
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,779
not about the moon. It's not about like howling at the moon. Can I just be like four fictional

134
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:51,579
characters combined? Yeah, that'd be a werewolf but like with like a green Sonic the Hedgehog stripe

135
00:21:51,579 --> 00:22:13,799
of hair. A gamma radiated werewolf. Okay, fuck you. Hold on. Goku. Yeah, and I'm a Saiyan. Oh, die.

136
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:30,599
OC. God, all those cars. You know, like when I think of the Hulk, that would be so awful. Do

137
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:35,460
you know how many times I just get fucking angry? It would be so bad. I would never be able to

138
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,619
control it. You know how many times I've been in my car just like fucking furious?

139
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:48,119
Imagine like turning into the Hulk in like your car. That would be so fucked up.

140
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:56,650
When you cut somebody off and they're like, hey, and they go like, yeah, fuck you buddy. You give

141
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,930
him like the finger out the window and then this person speeds by you like 15 seconds later.

142
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,849
Their head is outside of the car and they're big and green and they're like coming after you.

143
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:30,140
What's that meltdown? Yeah, I would be, it would be bad. So many times that I just get so just I

144
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,619
turn on it like just Donald Duck. You know what I mean? Like I just get so just worked up.

145
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:51,380
I would never be a good Hulk. Who's shooting a bone arrow at me? That's an invisible ridge.

146
00:23:51,380 --> 00:24:01,160
Just hold on. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Invisible Andy. Okay. Yeah. 100% that's an invisible ridge. Oh,

147
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:27,210
invisible Andy. Yeah. Game crashed. You guys crashed my fucking computer. What the fuck?

148
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:46,039
What the fuck? It just actually crashed my whole computer. I'm stuck here. Um,

149
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:57,289
okay. Hold on a second. Oh Jesus. This is bad. All right. I'll be right back if the stream turns

150
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:06,279
off. This is actually really bad. I can't even like get rid of this. I can't, I can't alt F4

151
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:15,690
the game either. Fuck. Come on. It's doing that thing with my task manager is on the same screen

152
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:28,440
as the fucking game. So I can't go to the task manager. I cannot go to my task manager. How do

153
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:36,089
I get a tab? Windows key and tab. Yeah. Let me, well, I got it. No, I didn't. It keeps going

154
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:40,740
behind the game. Yeah. I, I pull it up. Okay. I think my whole computer is going down. The whole

155
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:45,450
computer is going down. I'll see you guys in a minute. My whole computer is going down.

156
00:25:45,450 --> 00:26:01,059
The whole thing's coming down. I'll be back in a minute. Fuck. What? Dude, I can't get it.

157
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:12,569
Windows tab. And then like, I can't get it. No, this, I'm going to have to, I have to restart

158
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:17,210
the computer. I got to like turn, I got to hold the power button on. Use the arrow keys. I can't.

159
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:25,690
Go look at the fucking invisible bridge. You invisible bridge Andes. I would have been fine.

160
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:35,240
Windows key plus right. Oh, it's not doing anything. I can, I can get it on my screen,

161
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:50,660
but it immediately goes away. Real tough. There's an option to have task manager always on top.

162
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:58,259
Yeah. I mean, I just selected it. Oh my God. That person, unfucking believable. You just

163
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:03,819
saved the whole stream. Yeah. You just literally saved the stream. Okay. I'm coming back. We're

164
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:16,779
good. You just actually saved the stream. Thank you. Well, I don't know how much progress we just,

165
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:25,259
we didn't really progress that much, but that was weird. What the fuck? Kind of afraid to see

166
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:37,180
where we end up now. Yeah. For those of you that want to know what I did, if you right click in

167
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:45,000
the task manager, like that little icon, you can say always on top and it worked. What an absolute

168
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,289
genius. Did you mod that guy? No. You should VIP him. I mean, that was pretty, that was pretty

169
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:59,849
POG, but see if they have any other POG related things in the near future. Oh, I want to show

170
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:07,109
this too. Hold on. Somebody, somebody actually made this. I need to see this on. Remember,

171
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:11,539
do you remember yesterday when I did like the comedy routine joke? Let's do that right now,

172
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,619
actually, before I, because my Elden Ring is like freaking out. It's like, I need to download the

173
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:30,809
cloud. So hold on. I want to do this. Not that. I love that's the last thing that was saved.

174
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:38,460
These are really romantic candles. So I made a reference. Like the stupid candle routine was

175
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:46,299
just essentially a comedy routine. So let's see how this plays out. These are really romantic

176
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:58,089
candles. Oh, it probably stinks up here. I, gosh, I filled the room with the red candles like you

177
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:09,000
wanted. Gary, you fucking idiot. Did you have to get the red cinnamon apple candle from Yankee

178
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,849
Candle and put it in every room? We have to, we're gonna have to fucking open the windows and not

179
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:20,740
come back here for like a week. That's one of the most powerful, that's one of the most powerful of

180
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:29,799
all the candles and I hate them. I swear to God, I can tell, I can tell when a neighbor likes one

181
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:39,019
of those candles. Drives me crazy. Is that like cinnamon, it's like the fall cinnamon cider apple

182
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:44,299
one? It's just like, no, I like it for like a second but I don't want to fill my whole neighborhood

183
00:29:44,299 --> 00:30:00,950
with that. The cough at the end. That was, Marie made that. Thank you, Marie. That was really funny.

184
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:09,420
You know what's weird? Old television shows and even current television shows, they just like make

185
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,259
you think that something was that funny. When it just, you almost, the laugh track was sort of like

186
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:20,970
I don't want to be left out kind of thing, right? Where it's like, you don't want to be left out

187
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,369
because people are laughing at something. So if you don't laugh, it's like, fuck, I'm the only

188
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:39,990
person not doing that. I guess I have to. I love knowing when to laugh. I have a video that plays a

189
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:48,970
laugh track sometimes randomly during your streams. Somebody's called me a dumbass. Why?

190
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:57,500
What the hell, man? Why? Don't, dumbass. What the heck? Brew. What? I didn't do anything.

191
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,410
Why do you think I'm a dumbass? All right, I'm coming back. Hopefully this isn't fucking,

192
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:14,940
I don't care if that's an invisible bridge. I'm not going over there. Okay, I'm already getting

193
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,940
like shot by an arrow. Wait, that's it. I don't want to look at that. I am terrified to actually

194
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:29,240
go look at that. Well, you got a shirt change. Yeah. All right. Hey, let me get my bearings for

195
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:38,410
a second. What the fuck is happening? All right. I don't want, if it's going to crash the game,

196
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:43,349
what am I, I don't, I'm scared to go over there. A game crash there too. It should be fine. Now

197
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:20,660
there should be a lean down button on the horse. Just get off. All right. What's going on?

198
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,819
Something. Look at how weird this looks. Something's wrong here already. There's

199
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:28,660
something weird with the shadows. I don't know. This is fucking up. Look at something's wrong

200
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:36,890
with this. I don't want to be here. Look at how fucked up like the triangle shadows and shit.

201
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:48,940
Something's wrong over here. Run, run dude. Is there actually an invisible bridge here? This

202
00:32:48,940 --> 00:33:05,480
whole area feels like broken. I thought the game crashed. I thought the game crashed. Okay. All

203
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:16,900
right. All right. All right. All right. So it wasn't bullshit. Wait, I need rainbow stones.

204
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:53,420
I have a shit load. Don't I have nine? I can make way more than that. Okay. Here we go. What if it

205
00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:17,750
ends? It's just gonna fucking end. Where does this go? Can I throw them? I'm so afraid that it's

206
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:49,829
going to end. I think I'm already falling off. Holy shit. I can't go that way either. What? All

207
00:34:49,829 --> 00:35:06,949
right. We can go this way. Oh, fuck. I'm going to run out of these things. I think I'm going to run

208
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:20,539
out. What? People are laughing at me. You lost on a straight line. What? What do you mean? I couldn't

209
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:37,059
go that way. What do you mean? It gets... What? Did I get... Are you sure? Why was I going to fall

210
00:35:37,059 --> 00:36:06,489
off over there? Am I stupid? Just go. Just go. What happened there? It goes straight. Stop.

211
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:21,750
You're fucking lying. You're a liar. Oh, why does this... Okay. I think I got it. So it's only...

212
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Okay. It's... I get it. Okay. I understand. All right. No, I'm afraid. Does this turn left?

213
00:36:48,760 --> 00:37:00,039
It probably turns left here. There's no way it leads right here. It's going to go that way.

214
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:16,300
Okay. Yeah. Just run forward. Just run forward and die. I don't think those things... I hope

215
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:38,789
these things are not used for anything else. Yeah. It's a straight line, Jerma. It's a straight line.

216
00:37:38,789 --> 00:38:06,760
You don't know how to run in a straight line? What the fuck? What? I see... I know I have to

217
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:26,730
go there, but I'm afraid of just going there. What keeps happening? All right. This is an

218
00:38:26,730 --> 00:39:03,480
invisible wall then? It's not. Shit. This is not an invisible wall? What the fuck am I

219
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:13,179
supposed to do about this? I can't make that jump from here. Hit it multiple times.

220
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:20,940
There's nothing here, man. Why is there an invisible bridge that leads into a wall?

221
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:58,570
I don't know. This has to be a reason. Really? What's the point? What? Look for the mist.

222
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:47,019
Oh, shit. Whoa. Do these stay permanently? It looks like a Christmas decoration. All right.

223
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:50,780
I'm gonna put one here just so I remember that I can actually do this. I'm gonna put one back

224
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,699
there because I want to make sure I know that I can actually do this. All right. Well, that was

225
00:40:54,699 --> 00:41:05,179
fucking cool. The reticle... the seal on the rise opened. I need like a bonfire or something.

226
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,039
I can't believe you actually did an invisible bridge. I thought you guys were fucking with me.

227
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:51,690
All right. Let's go up. Hold on. I gotta move this. Oh. Up. I need a place to heal or something.

228
00:41:51,690 --> 00:42:03,480
This is probably like a memory stone or something. He almost growled at us. Memory stone? All these

229
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:14,949
rises have sorcery stuff, so why would we ever fuck with you? I don't know. You crashed my...

230
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:22,920
crashed my computer like 20 minutes ago. I'm holding you responsible for everything else going

231
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:31,099
forward. Oh, memory stone, right? It has to be. That's a legendary memory stone.

232
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:44,650
Founding Reign of Stars. Releases a downpour of star rain for a while.

233
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:53,539
Sorcery of legendary status. Summons a dark cloud of stars overhead. Shortly after the cloud will

234
00:42:53,539 --> 00:43:00,780
release a violent deluge of star rain. This sorcery can be cast while in motion. It's about to be the

235
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:10,730
founding glintstone sorcery. All right. I'll try it. It's a golden legendary. Yeah. That's cool.

236
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:22,809
I'll check it out. All right. I gotta mock this. Sword means I did it and like did the thing in

237
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:30,179
there. I started to try to do that before, but I gotta start doing that because I will look at

238
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:36,460
the map and go, what's this? Heretical rise? What's that thing? That's cool. All right. So let me...

239
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,989
I can just leave from here. Is there... are there gonna be a bonfire somewhere in this building?

240
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:59,110
All right. Yeah. When I... people are asking like what's with the Boston accent? Anytime...

241
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,909
I mean, if Starlight's in the inventory, then like it's gonna come out.

242
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,659
Like if I have... if I got Starlight in my pocket, like I can... it'll come out.

243
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:17,099
There's what? When this comes off, if I replace Starlight, then it'll probably go away. I apologize

244
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:33,909
so I can advance. I'm sorry. I can hit it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot about that.

245
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:43,019
I want to do that too. I want to go get the remembrance so I can do cold sorceresses.

246
00:44:44,219 --> 00:45:02,300
That was part of the plan too. Wait, is that a painting? It's not. You know, uh, okay. I've got

247
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:10,380
a disappointment. I've got one disappointment for you. Falling snow marks something unseen.

248
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:18,139
Oh, I did this whole... I did this backwards. I just went completely in reverse. Okay. Well,

249
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:24,059
they're weird. Uh, I've got a Elden Ring complaint for you and it's not a complaint as much as it's

250
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:29,420
I wish there were more. I thought there were going to be way more of those hidden kind of

251
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:35,320
area painting things. There's some of my favorite parts of the entire game. I wish there was a ton

252
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:42,739
of them. Going to find that one little spot is so cool. It's so fun. It's so much more like reason

253
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:49,429
to kind of go explore. There's like six in the game that I've found so far and there's probably

254
00:45:49,429 --> 00:46:00,659
like 10 to 12 in the game total. I wish there was like 30. I love that. I love trying to find that

255
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:07,110
one little spot. Okay, this my computer is not happy. My computer is not happy right now here.

256
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:22,329
This area is really just like my computer hates it. I need a bonfire. So bad. I caught

257
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:38,699
him. It's actually pretty good. No horse Andy. I'm just exploring. Oh shit. This is gonna take me

258
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:45,670
down here. I don't want to do that yet. Maybe I'll get the map fragment. Yeah, let me get the map.

259
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:59,289
Just let me get the map fragment. I'll come back. That looks suspicious over there. There are seven

260
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:07,460
paintings. I did. I've done like four or five. How many we've done? Like what? Four? That's pretty

261
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:29,880
sus over there. It is. Stop making me say that. All right, seriously need a bonfire because I want

262
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:41,050
to go get the remembrance from Ronella. Are you wearing red because you're the imposter? Yes.

263
00:47:48,579 --> 00:48:02,389
All right. Worst noise. So clip it and put it in your inbox or something for later this year.

264
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:16,150
I'm not going to tell you what you can and cannot nominate. Yeah, I'll get the map fragment. I'm

265
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:30,659
very curious. What was that? I don't know. Oh, Evergold. Everjail. Lord Contenders Everjail.

266
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:36,469
Should we just go here? Is there a statue here? Because I don't want to do this unless there is.

267
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:48,760
Is there a statue? There is right here. Okay. Let's just go lose. Look under your HP bar.

268
00:48:50,340 --> 00:49:11,739
Oh right, yeah. Okay, let me try it. This is a boss. Let's go. Round Table Knight Mike? I don't

269
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:50,260
know what that does. What's he doing? Hey, what? An actual named boss can drink a potion

270
00:49:50,260 --> 00:50:38,550
with a bar at the bottom? I don't think I've seen that. Oh, fuck. Oh, he's trying to drink

271
00:50:38,550 --> 00:51:20,980
another potion. Oh, don't be greedy. Oh, fuck. A clean finish. Mike's Dragon Bolt. Fingerprint

272
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:32,570
helm. That was a clean fight. Somebody just said, where is that? I'll show you right now.

273
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:38,250
It is in the mountaintop of giants. Looks like along this road that comes down here. I don't

274
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:51,619
know the map fragments. Sorry. It's this Everjail. Lord Contenders Everjail. What does that say?

275
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:59,139
Bolsters right hand, armament, and body with red lightning. Incantation of Vike,

276
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:04,019
Knight of the Round Table Hold. Summons red lightning to bolster both the caster's body

277
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:10,760
and their armament held in the right hand. So it enchants your weapon with red lightning.

278
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,920
Enchants armament with lightning affinity attacks and increases maximum equipment load.

279
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:31,260
That's weird. This is the From Software armor? What do you mean? Fingerprint armor.

280
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:49,300
Iron armor signed and blistered by fingers. Born by Vike, Knight of the Round Table Hold.

281
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,340
No other Tarnished was closer to the throne of the Elden Lord than Vike.

282
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,619
But without announcement, Vike traveled far below the capital and was scorched by the flame of

283
00:52:57,619 --> 00:53:03,059
frenzy. Did he make his choice for his maiden or did some other force lure him with suggestion?

284
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:23,139
Oh, it's Box Art Andy. Really? Is it? Box Art Andy. Okay. This helm is potentially better than

285
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:33,559
what I have on, but it doesn't boost sorceries. Is this the Box Art? I thought the Box Art had

286
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:46,730
like kind of hair coming back. Old goat gauntlets? What the fuck are these? Fingerprint greaves.

287
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:54,440
All right, I'd like my setup right now. The raging wolf armor is the Box Art armor. Yeah,

288
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:01,699
I thought the Box Art had hair out there. Using the trailer armor. That was cool. That's a cool

289
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:07,019
spell too. I wonder if it's any good. But it's a From Software game, so no, it's not going to be.

290
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:15,500
That'll go on the list of like, okay, From Software like spell tier list. Let's say we have S, A,

291
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:22,780
B, and whatever. Literally B, A, B, C, and D don't matter. There's like five moves that are at S

292
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,860
and then 70 that are at do not equip, like at the very bottom, like under F.

293
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:43,429
So probably looks cool. You should equip a branch. I got 100,000 souls. This is gonna get ugly real

294
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:53,960
quick. I need a I need a bonfire. Min-max Andy. I mean, I'm obviously just, you know, taking a piss,

295
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:03,670
but not these. Yeah, but whenever I get a new spell, it seems I'll be like, oh, dude,

296
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:09,190
star shards from outer space. And the sea of chat is just like, oh, no, dude, they're worthless.

297
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,590
It's like fucking awful. It takes like 80% of your mana bar, and it does like 12 damage. It's like,

298
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:25,530
oh, okay. Oh, Glimblade of the Distressed Soldier. No, dude, don't even put it on.

299
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:31,530
It's way too slow, and just swinging your regular weapon will hurt for more.

300
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:42,679
Okay, I guess. All right, I'm gonna die from one of these. Get on the road.

301
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:59,449
Ooh, what's this? Thank you. Although it's fun to have like the sorceries and then some of the

302
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:15,820
incantations. They're cool. Founding stars is OP though. You should talk to, wait, can I talk?

303
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:29,260
I can. All right, shh. We're almost there. The Flame of Ruin lies just ahead. Just ahead. I'm glad

304
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,619
it was you I traveled with. I must tender my thanks to Torrent too. Thank you, Torrent.

305
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:46,659
Please continue to lend your aid till the end. There is something I'd like to say. My purpose

306
00:56:46,659 --> 00:56:56,630
was given to me by my mother, but now I act of my own volition. I have set my heart upon the world

307
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:05,340
that I would have, regardless of my mother's designs. This is America's daughter. It's America's daughter.

308
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:15,670
Not even you. Man, it is, right?

309
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:39,079
Can you talk to her again? I don't think so. Oh, right. I want to try that new move. Let's see.

310
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:46,360
Come on, From Software. Give me a move that's not swift boring glint blade, swift pebble stone.

311
00:57:47,000 --> 00:58:13,190
That was works and is good. Can't take that off. Where is it? Oh, it takes two slots. All right,

312
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:40,969
a hundred and how much FP does it cost to do this? That lasts a long time. Okay.

313
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:48,309
Let's test it out on this unsuspecting loser right here. Hey, just stand right there for me,

314
00:58:48,309 --> 00:59:09,500
if you will. It's okay. It's all right. I mean, it's actually that would be really good if the

315
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:18,739
group is chasing you around. I did. I charged it. Let's just aggro everybody. Let's like see what

316
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:36,170
happens. All right, let's go like fucking run around. Somebody come and get me. It kind of

317
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:46,650
hurts my eyes. Probably good for stationary large bosses. That's true. I'll leave it on.

318
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:58,389
It hits large enemies a lot. Okay. It doesn't actually take that much mana as much as I thought

319
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:06,179
it was going to. I thought it was going to be a lot more. Let's go. It's a cool spell. I like it.

320
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:25,269
Charge it. I am. I've charged it every time. Do you want me to prove it to you? I've been doing

321
01:00:25,269 --> 01:00:34,599
that every time. It's kind of like a dot. Okay. Here's why I'm going to keep it on. Its surface

322
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:41,099
area is actually huge and it lasts a very, very long time. It doesn't take that long to cast it

323
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:48,550
either. So I think it could be supplemental. She just said that like this is the end of the

324
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:54,230
game coming up here. She's like, oh, here it is. This is right ahead. Right. I'm kind of afraid

325
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:59,610
to do this right now. I'm right. Like I don't want to do this. I don't want to end the game.

326
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:53,739
Oh, okay. All right. I don't, I don't hate it. I actually think it's kind of good. Oh, it hurt.

327
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:53,260
Oh, I thought I fell off the cliff. Why did I just have an accent?

328
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:19,269
Why did I just have like a Italian accent? Oh, damn. I don't know why. I just had like a,

329
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:21,670
I had like a European accent for a second there. What was that?

330
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:33,050
Don't just run around. What's going on with my voice? It's because I have two headphones in.

331
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:47,940
I have two. I can't hear myself talk. So like, it's weird. Holy shit. What is that thing?

332
01:03:50,710 --> 01:04:13,989
Walk over here. Huh? Why did it turn off? I can't cast it multiple times.

333
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:37,590
I want it to rain down on these motherfuckers. It was patched. Was it actually? Can't cast two of

334
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:45,349
them. Yeah, that's kind of annoying. I need to swap out some stuff because I'm doing too much like

335
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:47,750
click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click,

336
01:04:47,750 --> 01:05:15,739
the herd tree chest. Uh, I still, I want the map fragment. I'll all right. Mark this right here.

337
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,619
Remember to remind me to come back to two because I want to go inside of there,

338
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:31,880
but I want the map fragment and we're going to go get it. I gotta go get the other staff too.

339
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:52,500
It's so good. All right. Somebody said fuck toad.

340
01:05:53,619 --> 01:06:43,079
All right. Let's see if we can get a triple here. It's truly amazing. What do you say? What

341
01:06:45,019 --> 01:06:56,019
moonlight spell? How did you get the moon blade? Uh, it was, I forget. Oh no, it's from the dragon.

342
01:06:56,739 --> 01:07:04,469
It's from the glint stone dragon that's in front of, um, that hangs around the Ronnie's, um,

343
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:14,380
and the rises, right? It's from the magic dragon. Keep going. I want the map fragment.

344
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:29,590
These are weird. Is it a little, um, statue like things? Oh God damn it. Where is the

345
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:39,239
map fragment? It's not all the way down there, right? Oh, it's right there. Isn't it?

346
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:59,210
This is a no. Okay. It's probably right here. That's right there. Jesus. These guys alive

347
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:05,929
and not. Oh, I thought that was one of those ghost people to talk to. This is a rock.

348
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:11,420
I didn't skip the castle. No, no, no, no, no. I'm coming here to get the map fragment first.

349
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:22,279
I'm, I just want the map fragment. There we go. All right. Now I can see what the hell is going

350
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:33,979
on here. All right. So this is where this looks. What is that? I don't know, but I'm not skipping

351
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:39,699
this. I just wanted the map. I can see where the hell I was. There's also something really

352
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:44,579
interesting here, which is what we're going to look at. I'm going to go do the fort here.

353
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:58,140
Is there a random mog like enemy incoming? I'm going to go in there. No,

354
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:13,989
no, it's not what we're doing. Where is the, where's the bell place? It's like here somewhere,

355
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:25,560
right? I want that remembrance because I want that stuff. Where is it? Hurry up and tell me.

356
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:34,069
Where is it? Northeast Lake. Fucking hurry up. When I asked something, I expect there to be

357
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:38,420
something in the fucking chat immediately. None of this like talking, talking, like hanging out,

358
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:47,909
having fun. No, when I asked something, fucking answer it. Fucking unbelievable. Where was it?

359
01:09:47,909 --> 01:10:00,090
Where? I didn't even see it. Stop spamming the chat. I'm quitting tomorrow. I quit. I quit tomorrow.

360
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:12,100
Wait, where is it? The Eastern part of the lake. Worst face. Werewolf face. I'm sorry, the moon,

361
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:32,739
the moon's up. Northeast. I'm just going to go here. Northeast next to the castle. Like right

362
01:10:32,739 --> 01:10:35,699
over here around. I'll just go look around for it. Yeah. It's like, isn't it right here?

363
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:55,270
It was walking around here. You've changed. I know. I know. Just like, I just hate being here.

364
01:10:56,229 --> 01:11:01,000
All right. Would you guys, let me ask you a question. Those are the viewers.

365
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:08,170
Right. Would that be, okay. If I was like that, would that be funny? Would you be watching to

366
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:14,569
watch me have like a meltdown? Is that like funny? Or like, would you like not, would you be like,

367
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:18,810
nah, I don't want to watch this guy. This guy like is a fucking dick. He's like always hates like

368
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:37,770
Hey, who did that? Oh, depends on if it's a joke. Yeah. I'd be sad. No, it's never going to get there.

369
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:45,399
Don't worry. You guys already know the minute that I'm not having a good time anymore. It's

370
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:54,649
like, all right, that's it. Right? Like that's it. That's not, don't worry. I would subscribe for

371
01:11:54,649 --> 01:12:05,079
like meltdowns. Would you? Well, I think I already do that. North like up here. Did I,

372
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:18,539
I feel like it's not over here. Is it even further up here? East literally. You literally

373
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:33,079
looked at it. North east of regular area here. It's to the east. You're staring at it. Oh,

374
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:47,909
but like my view distance is low. I actually haven't made this one sit down. Did I? Yeah.

375
01:12:47,909 --> 01:13:07,739
I made the other ones. There's a lot of fucking people here. Your IRL view distance. Yeah. This

376
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:19,239
one's not moving for like my head and the bell. Uh, there's nothing to brush off either. I have

377
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:51,880
to do something else. Yeah. Ring the bell. That's what I'm gonna try. I don't think I can hit it.

378
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:13,479
Um, there's a dungeon over there that I didn't do. Ah, me strong will do it. All right. Except

379
01:14:13,479 --> 01:14:16,279
what about the people that are around the bell? Maybe if I aggro the people that are around the

380
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:25,720
bell, right? That makes sense. All right. So it's just like, okay, here it goes. I'm like whacking

381
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:42,710
the spirits over here and you can hear the screams of the spirits to jump on it. How the fuck am I

382
01:14:42,710 --> 01:15:11,619
supposed to jump on it from here? I'm up there. Teleport to this grace above, like up here. You

383
01:15:11,619 --> 01:16:07,300
mean bugged? It's supposed to be moving. Give me the item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

384
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:25,449
So I have to jump from up here. We're going down together. How am I supposed to land on that?

385
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:37,989
I don't understand. How am I supposed to land on that? Okay. Is it like one of those is this soft?

386
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:59,130
Wait, I already have one of these right here. I get to use this one. Okay. Cool. Oh, oh,

387
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:25,220
I need the other one. How am I supposed to get onto that? I definitely, it's probably a jump from

388
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,460
here and you can, it's probably soft enough on top where it doesn't kill you. But if it does,

389
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:35,140
just know that this is an experiment. Somebody said it's bugged. It's supposed to be moving,

390
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:39,220
but I mean, would the game really be this bugged over and over again after loading like three

391
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:54,659
times? Kill that guy real quick. All right. It's a clear. It is moving. Fuck. It was bugged.

392
01:17:54,659 --> 01:18:07,189
It was bugged. Come on. Is it only moving certain times of the day? I can't make it from here. So

393
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:20,060
we're going to have to go back to where I was. They sleep at night. Well, let me make sure it's

394
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:38,739
daytime, like right in the middle of noon or whatever. Well, you, your runes. I don't get out

395
01:18:38,739 --> 01:19:09,159
of bed for less than 50 K. It was 45. Not what I said. I'll get them. Don't worry. Have you ever

396
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:15,989
played Ocarina of Time? Oh yeah. I played Ocarina of Time when it came out. I remember sitting there

397
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:24,039
playing in my bedroom. Game had just just released and it was like, holy shit, this is crazy.

398
01:19:31,369 --> 01:19:43,819
Old. I mean, yeah, I was old. I mean, I mean, I am old. I don't know. How old was I? When did

399
01:19:43,819 --> 01:20:00,520
it come out? Like 1996 or something. Okay. So how does this work? 1998. 24 years ago. 24, 25 years

400
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:19,289
ago. I was 14. 13. I don't know. All right. So how do I do this now? Does it have a gunk on it?

401
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:38,100
Oh, you piece of shit. It's going that way. I have to, I have to jump over here, right?

402
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:52,680
I, yes, I definitely have to jump from right here. It's going to keep walking just over there.

403
01:20:53,399 --> 01:21:26,060
So it's like here. I, okay. All right. Get the runes too. Stop. What? What? I can't get it from

404
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:33,960
here? This kills me. I'm going to be pissed. All right. My runes are right here. Let's get those.

405
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:59,619
And then I have to jump from like over there. There. Right there.

406
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:26,779
Fuck you. So I just want to get there now. You know what I mean? Like I don't want to like,

407
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,739
I want to just fucking get there. I don't want to just do this. Get me there now. Right now.

408
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:48,180
God damn it. It's not from the cliff. What do you mean? It's not the cliff. What the fuck?

409
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:03,880
It is from the cliff. Minus 45k. I don't, at this point, I don't care.

410
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:12,250
I'll go get them in a minute. Should we have sprint spring on the lake? What is a sprint spring?

411
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:26,439
Is this Sonic the Hedgehog? What's a sprint spring? Sprint spring? Horse jump. That's,

412
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:31,239
you should just say horse jump. Sprint spring doesn't, no, it's a horse jump. Horse jump.

413
01:23:32,199 --> 01:24:13,510
It's fucking midnight. I didn't think this was going to take this long to go get this stupid

414
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:21,670
remembrance. If I had known this was going to take this long, I would have just fucking

415
01:24:21,670 --> 01:24:43,420
burnt the urn tree by now. What? Look, everybody's got all the, okay, there's like 17 endings in this

416
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:48,300
game, right? You're, you're bad. You're, they're all bad. You're all, there's no good. Oh, I'm a good

417
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:56,619
person. No, you burn the urn tree. You eat the fucking fire. You kill the fingers. You

418
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,819
kill the lady. Like, there's none, there's nothing good. There's no like, oh, you're a good guy.

419
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:08,460
No, there is no good person ending. There's like, kill this person or like eat this person, right?

420
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:16,710
We're going to end up eating someone or burning something. So I, look, I don't know what you want

421
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:31,670
to tell you. There, there is no like, oh, that's a good one. No. Okay. I'm ready to move on from

422
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:41,750
this or I freak out. Meat grinder ending. There's never been a good ending in a souls game. That,

423
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:56,649
yeah, that's, all right. So where's this, uh, spring pad? I don't see a spring pad. Don't

424
01:25:56,649 --> 01:26:15,829
crush me. Spring pad. Oh, there it is. There's the sprint spring. All right. Now get over here.

425
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:20,979
What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? What time is it?

426
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:35,189
No, I thought it was stopping. Jump on him with the spring.

427
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:51,850
Wow. You are full of shit. You are full of shit.

428
01:26:56,020 --> 01:28:02,409
Get over here. Just wait. Have you fought the fallen? Yeah, I killed it in one hit.

429
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:41,579
You can double jump. Can I? He's close. He's closer. He's closer. Okay. He's close.

430
01:28:49,350 --> 01:28:53,510
Oh my God. I can't. Why are you not over here yet?

431
01:28:54,949 --> 01:29:04,659
Why do you take so long to get over here? You're not going the other way, right?

432
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:16,569
All right. For everyone telling me to look at its feet. That's not how you do this one.

433
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,670
The fuck is right there. All right. This motherfucker is right there. You were lying

434
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:46,739
to me. It's not the jump. You were lying to me. It's over there. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

435
01:29:48,140 --> 01:30:12,729
literally lying to my face. Got it.

436
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:39,500
What happened? Why did that happen? I have to wait again. I have to go from a lower one. Hey,

437
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:43,420
okay. I'm going to give this five more minutes before we're going to eat this controller.

438
01:30:54,069 --> 01:30:59,750
So we just, okay. I, so I was right. Who needs the thing? I, I could go from here.

439
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:04,789
I actually could go from here. You guys, I had it right from the very beginning.

440
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:14,069
No, no, you got to go down. Let me explain what you guys told me to do. You got to go

441
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:25,380
down to the lake to jump up from the spirit jump to where you were already standing. I was

442
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:38,420
already there. I, like, I would get to this edge and there were those gravestones. Remember I died

443
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:43,140
from them and you guys were like, no, dude, you're fucking stupid. You're a fucking idiot. This is

444
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:49,060
wrong. And I'm like, it's wrong. What do you mean? No, you got to go down to go up to where you are.

445
01:31:51,529 --> 01:32:16,739
Uh-huh. What? Okay. So it's over here. Wait, where am I? Why is there to be so foggy down there?

446
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:29,590
See, look at all this shit. I have to go right there. Okay. See, that's where I was going.

447
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:36,550
And everybody told me you go, don't fucking rush it. Don't rush it. I rushed it. I rushed it. I

448
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:43,989
rushed it. I put a quick game. Okay. I'm just, okay, I just fucking get a trainer and just get

449
01:32:43,989 --> 01:32:51,189
the resemblance. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to do this at the 15th time. This

450
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:55,989
requires patience. I just need patience, man. I just need patience. I'm going to do it wherever,

451
01:32:55,989 --> 01:33:00,630
okay, I'm going to go from here. I'm going to go up the thing. This is so fucking easy.

452
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:06,550
I just don't want to spend the five minutes to wait for his slow ass to go over to the edge.

453
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:16,060
Why can't I just fucking punch him? Why can't I just? This resemblance better be worth it.

454
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:24,439
Otherwise I'm going to be pissed. This dude can't even jump on a building. I did jump on a building

455
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:30,760
and it killed me. Now I'm being told, well, Jerva, you actually went off. You have to go

456
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:49,529
from a little bit lower. I'm like, okay. Dude, this is a kid's game. Relax. This game is not for kids.

457
01:33:57,829 --> 01:34:03,350
I'm not sure what would be like. Okay. Those like Elsa Spider-Man videos and like Elden Ring.

458
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:08,069
I don't know what could be worse for a child's brain. So I, you know what I mean? Like this is

459
01:34:08,069 --> 01:34:23,750
not a kid's game. Don't let a kid play this. My little sister plays this game. Don't let it. Don't

460
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:57,909
let a child play this. Time is it. It's moving. Okay. Simple. It's so simple. It's easy right there

461
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:03,029
all down to a level where I can jump on it and just jump onto it. It's going to be worth it.

462
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:12,359
I'm going to become a cold sorcerer. Simple. It's so easy. Here we are. We're right here.

463
01:35:13,479 --> 01:35:25,140
It's so easy. My sister's 24. Well then. All right. But yeah, don't don't do. Okay. Get off the

464
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:50,409
horse. The horses make overcomplicates this. How low do I need to be? This is where I jumped from

465
01:35:50,409 --> 01:35:58,180
before. So all right. If I go from, oh my god. Okay. If I go from here, there's no, there's nothing

466
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:02,760
else I can jump from. This is the only one I can jump from. There's no other one to jump from.

467
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:38,819
Now we just have to wait an hour. Shit. It's not over there, right? It's not over there. It's

468
01:36:38,819 --> 01:36:49,930
definitely here. You need to fight Mog. When I eventually get to Mog, I'm gonna snap his neck.

469
01:36:50,649 --> 01:37:10,180
I'm gonna sneak up behind Mog and just grab him. Just, just turn. Turn. Uncle W. It's Mog. It's a

470
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:16,649
Mog. What do you mean? Oh no. But sneaking up on sneaking up behind Mog with a fucking

471
01:37:16,649 --> 01:37:22,250
sword this long and shoving it through his back. Oh fuck. But I say I'm going to snap Mog's neck.

472
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:52,310
Oh my god. Relax. Oh my goodness. Now? Nope. Nobody said if you, I bet a three day ban,

473
01:37:52,310 --> 01:38:12,279
you don't make it. If I make this ban that person for three days. Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

474
01:38:13,239 --> 01:38:20,069
I gotta get up there. You're about to be banned for three days. Turning around.

475
01:38:24,279 --> 01:38:45,260
Ah! God damn it. I actually can't believe it. He's turning around. Was he not turning? I thought

476
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:52,630
he was turning around. What am I doing this for? Because there's an item in there that I really,

477
01:38:52,630 --> 01:39:02,630
really need. Was he turning around though? It looked like he was turning and walking the other

478
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:14,149
way. Is it actually the jump from the horse? Go get a different one. I'm begging you. There's a

479
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:29,029
different one. Where's the other one? There are like eight. This island south of Limgrave.

480
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:40,869
One down here. But wouldn't, isn't this one, do you have to do the certain ones? I thought it like,

481
01:39:40,869 --> 01:39:50,600
it didn't, it's not tied to the area? No. How come I couldn't get Ranales from the one I just went

482
01:39:50,600 --> 01:40:05,180
to? It wasn't available. Behind the, next to the shack on the left side. Okay. Some are minor.

483
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:27,989
The ones with bells are the ones you need. Oh. Oh. Oh. So is this one weird or is this one just

484
01:40:27,989 --> 01:40:32,229
clean as feet? This one's definitely just clean as feet. Okay. Sure. Let's go.

485
01:40:34,460 --> 01:41:01,350
Why would this make walking harder? Wouldn't this make walking easier?

486
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:47,529
All right. Finally. So, fucking sick. Let's go. All right. We want Ranales.

487
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:59,640
Oh, that's so annoying. All right. I want Ranales remembrance. I want the staff from, you know,

488
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:07,909
because I want to do cold. Now, please confirm this. The full moon sorceries are cold sorceries.

489
01:42:07,909 --> 01:42:13,670
Please. I'm asking you. This is, this is cold. Full moon sorcery is cold sorcery.

490
01:42:18,649 --> 01:42:27,739
What's the point of me doing this? It's just the moon ones. But is, my sword counts.

491
01:42:28,539 --> 01:42:55,510
But like, I think so. I hope so. It buffs all magic. It boosts moon sorcery. It doesn't boost

492
01:42:55,510 --> 01:43:00,869
your sword. No, no, no. I'm talking about, I don't want to just waste this if this is wrong.

493
01:43:00,869 --> 01:43:15,590
I need some lore masters to tell me. This moon blade is a moon sorcery. Right? It won't boost

494
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:26,460
the moon blade. Moon sorcery is different. No. Well, why am I doing this? It won't boost the

495
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:39,289
sword. Only moon spells. It does not boost the moon blade. Why am I doing this? Moon blade counts

496
01:43:39,289 --> 01:43:50,939
as a carrion sword. Did one guy put up, put like an hour on this stream of us going and doing this?

497
01:43:51,579 --> 01:44:03,319
Because the whole, the whole point was to get that new staff. It's a good staff regardless.

498
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:22,119
Carrion glintstone staff is the one that boosts this spell. Do I have that? I'm going to sorcerers

499
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:30,710
that might enact the role of knight enhances carrion sword sorceries. This is, that's a carrion,

500
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:47,689
but it's an OP staff. You're already here. Might as well just do it. I already told me to do this.

501
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:52,069
The best staff and upgrades the moon spell, which is the best spell in the game.

502
01:44:52,710 --> 01:45:10,149
It's a snow witch sorcery. Well, then I'm going to have to get some more moon shit.

503
01:45:10,789 --> 01:45:27,899
I mean, what do I need? I need 60 int to put this on. Moon does not matter. Only two moon spells.

504
01:45:29,579 --> 01:45:36,899
It's the best. This is, is this the best? Whatever. I'm just, I'm buying it. I'm going to take it

505
01:45:37,619 --> 01:45:47,079
because I'm going to use it eventually here, but a boost full moon sorceries.

506
01:45:48,920 --> 01:46:01,770
It starts. This is also as scaling. That was a great, like 45 wasted minutes. Let's, let's,

507
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:07,829
let's continue the play through. Do you think so? Oh, duplicate it again to get the moon.

508
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:22,710
This was a filler episode. No, it's not. We're about to do real fucking content. You better get

509
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:46,010
ready. The moon is too slow. All right. Enough. Get, I'm going to get my fucking runes and we're

510
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:52,890
going to continue to play the game. And, uh, that was, you know, great content. It was, uh, about

511
01:46:52,890 --> 01:47:15,579
30 to 40 minutes of just wasted time. Um, all right. Runes are long gone. What do I mean? Wait,

512
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:39,529
are they? Your runes are gone away. I didn't have 40,000 runes. It died, died like 10 times.

513
01:47:39,529 --> 01:47:49,880
Oh yeah. Don't worry. You don't get out of bed for less than 50 K hypers.

514
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:59,939
So what's at this lake? Probably a monster. Let's explore the lake. Oh, I like the ice.

515
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:06,550
Something's going to come through the ice. I love this ice. Look at it's breaking. Yeah. I can see

516
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:10,869
the game. I can see the video game engine. I can see it. It's pieced together. Something's

517
01:48:10,869 --> 01:48:18,069
breaking out of this ice. It's going to be an ice dragon. I'm going to come through the ground

518
01:48:18,069 --> 01:48:26,810
and it's going to be insane. I was going to make sure I get a good view. Something here.

519
01:48:27,449 --> 01:49:18,600
Where is it? Just heard it. What the fuck? That was quick. My fucking God. I'm awful.

520
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:58,859
Oh my God. I'm not good. Ash of war. Sepuku. Sepuku. Use one swords. Uh, Sepuku, a forbidden

521
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:04,619
technique used by swordsmen from the lands of reeds. Punch the blade into your stomach

522
01:50:04,619 --> 01:50:09,100
to stain it with blood. Increases attack power and improves ability to inflict blood loss.

523
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:22,149
That's probably amazing. That sounds incredible. Get that on a fast weapon. It's OP. Yeah. It's

524
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:31,939
really OP. I imagine. All right. Where's the ice dragon? I want a good view. Right here. Here

525
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:54,760
it comes. Come on. Give me a good view. Yeah. Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. Where is it?

526
01:50:54,760 --> 01:51:02,329
I didn't get a good view. It's an ice dragon, isn't it? It is an ice dragon. I told you.

527
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:23,609
I was certain we were getting an ice dragon right here. This motherfucker definitely drops

528
01:51:23,609 --> 01:51:54,819
ice sorceress. You know it. Force force. I thought, okay, this is why I didn't move.

529
01:51:55,979 --> 01:52:01,659
Why? I thought I didn't. I thought it was going up to do the thing where it hovers and then lands.

530
01:52:01,659 --> 01:52:12,659
So I was going to dodge it and then get on the horse. Oh, you know what? That's not a bad idea.

531
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:25,050
I can cast this on the horse. Holy shit. What? Are you serious? I can actually do that? I'm in a

532
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:32,090
fucking weird mood. I'm sorry. Can you please do the me strong stream after you beat the game?

533
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:35,689
Everybody wants the me strong stream, but I don't know if I want. It's like, I don't want to like.

534
01:52:37,210 --> 01:53:05,319
Oh, okay. Why did I do that back there? Holy shit. Actually kind of good. It's actually awful here.

535
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:55,300
Yeah, it's awful. He moves around. Stamina, please. Where are you going? What are you doing?

536
01:53:56,100 --> 01:55:29,260
That was weird. Oh shit. What the fuck? Wait. Oh, my eye. It hit me in the eye. That felt

537
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:34,460
like it hit me in the eye in real life. I feel like my eye hurts. It hit me in the eye.

538
01:55:35,819 --> 01:55:46,890
I can't see. It like scratched my eye. I like that scratched my eye. That was crazy.

539
01:55:47,770 --> 01:56:03,579
What? There's no power. That was, I feel like it hit me in the face. Okay. Um, it was like,

540
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:09,579
was that 3D for anybody else here? That really felt like 3D. Like it came out of the screen and like.

541
01:56:11,770 --> 01:56:17,430
Okay. Um, so there's no, that's unfortunate. I thought I was going to get like an ice power.

542
01:56:17,989 --> 01:56:23,130
Well, that's cool though. There goes that dragon. That means we have completed that area.

543
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:37,859
Market. I didn't have any. Okay. Well, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That's not it.

544
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:45,399
Let's take a look out around the edges. Oh, it's a faith. Right, right, right, right.

545
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:55,859
You have a hundred thousand runes. I'm not going to lose a hundred thousand runes right now.

546
01:56:55,859 --> 01:57:00,970
I already lost 50k. I'm just checking in the area. There's nothing else here.

547
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:08,569
Exactly. That's why I came here. I want to take a look. I like this area. This area makes my teeth

548
01:57:08,569 --> 01:57:31,939
hurt. It's kind of cool. So that's just a big dragon. So, uh, this is a good place to wrap around.

549
01:57:31,939 --> 01:57:35,699
Wait a minute. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. The edge of the, uh, lake is a thing over there.

550
01:57:35,699 --> 01:57:50,520
I think probably like a church. This game is physically hurting you. Old era. Yeah. Like

551
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:21,109
it makes you turn purple too. Syn, synesthesia. What is that? It is a church. All right. I actually,

552
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:32,779
I'm pretty desperate for a better heal for this one in here. You need to replace your dentures.

553
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:47,510
Zomberstone miners bell bearing. Oh, thank God. Yes. Nice. Nice. Nice. Very nice.

554
01:58:52,329 --> 01:59:05,909
250 vitality. I think I have like 42. There we are. A sacred tear. What do you have to say?

555
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:17,779
Spoken echoes linger here. Words of Queen Marika who vanished long ago. If you wish,

556
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:25,859
I will share them with you. I'm interested. It's you and this is America. America's own words.

557
01:59:26,739 --> 01:59:35,939
Hark, brave warriors. Hark, my Lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds. Guidance hath delivered

558
01:59:35,939 --> 01:59:43,779
you through each ordeal to the place you stand. Put the giants to the sword and confine the flame

559
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:53,380
atop the mountain. Let a new epoch begin an epoch glistening with life. Brandish the Elden Ring

560
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:05,939
for the age of the tree. Yeah. Um, and I'm using the bathroom right now. There are no baths. I,

561
02:00:05,939 --> 02:00:13,210
I dig a hole and I go and this is kind of a weird time for you to be here. Appreciate the help though.

562
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:41,960
Classic fucking joke. Oh, oh, my mouth. What the fuck? Somebody this game's hurting me.

563
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:56,170
I just like bit a piece of skin off. This game hurts me. I like bit my skin on my lip

564
02:00:56,810 --> 02:01:03,800
and it was like, ow. Oh, that's it. Wait, do you have any more to say?

565
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:21,770
Oh, that's cool. Pretty cool, dude. Uh, I definitely need to, how many, how much do I have?

566
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:30,550
I need 60 to put that staff on. So let's see what I have the talisman. 58. I need two more

567
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:35,189
int and I can put the staff on. I think I might be able to get close. Let's find out.

568
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:46,899
I think it's because you have a UTI. Thanks doc.

569
02:01:48,659 --> 02:02:09,689
Secret tier. Oh, sorry. My ear was itchy. I could do that too. I had five. I thought I only had four.

570
02:02:10,569 --> 02:02:26,899
Oh shit. All right. We'll do tenon, the tenants break. Very cool. So I did this. Let's market

571
02:02:26,899 --> 02:02:32,100
just as completed. The sword means it has been complete. There is this bird tree. We're going

572
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:41,909
to do the urge tree. I'm gonna just head this way. What was over here? I'm not going to teleport

573
02:02:41,909 --> 02:02:48,819
because it might be something on the way. There's also this volcano manor thing, which I thought I

574
02:02:48,819 --> 02:03:02,739
couldn't do. Okay. That sounds like a plan to me. Keep going. What about the fort? Isn't that,

575
02:03:02,739 --> 02:03:13,939
isn't that this here? Fort to the north. Do you not see a marker on it? There's a marker on it.

576
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:29,720
Fight Mog. I will fight Mog when I feel like it. And now I'm going to wait till the final stream.

577
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:35,159
I'm going to summon him. I'm going to, I'm going to use his item,

578
02:03:36,789 --> 02:03:40,789
like on the edge of a cliff. I'm going to summon him in front of me and he's going to fall like

579
02:03:40,789 --> 02:03:53,260
wily coyote style and die. Back over here. All right. That can go that way. What's this? Ooh,

580
02:03:53,979 --> 02:03:59,369
there's a spring jump and there's a casket. This is uncovering.

581
02:03:59,369 --> 02:04:36,340
Don't get me dogs. That's actually kind of good against dogs, even though I use like three potions.

582
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:44,090
Oh yeah. Yup. Yup. Yup. Yup. I can definitely level up now.

583
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:49,350
And then I'm going to have to commit to putting a bunch of stones into that thing.

584
02:04:50,069 --> 02:04:54,420
I hope that's actually a good staff and it wasn't a huge mistake.

585
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:06,680
Best move in the game. I don't think it's the best move in the game.

586
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:13,829
You know what's really crazy about this? Like these caskets, they're kind of everywhere.

587
02:05:13,829 --> 02:05:18,359
People are like coming out of these caskets and coming back to life.

588
02:05:19,989 --> 02:05:26,630
Weird. Why are these like tarnished? It's interesting. These are because there's been

589
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:34,630
at least like two of these in every single zone and they always have the little runes on them.

590
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:42,149
Like that's the last little bits of their like souls or something. They all, yeah,

591
02:05:42,149 --> 02:05:48,250
they like wake up and like get up and start walking around. Really weird, but let's do this.

592
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:56,680
Is that, is there anything else down there that I didn't, it might be a dungeon down here though.

593
02:06:07,539 --> 02:06:16,380
It's probably a dungeon here. Just look. Is it gonna kill me? It's gonna, it's gonna kill me,

594
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:31,989
isn't it? Let me see if there's like dungeon right here. I feel like there would be. It's not. Stop

595
02:06:31,989 --> 02:06:38,779
using the baby toy weapon. It's, it's really good. It's been great so far. Why, why would I stop

596
02:06:38,779 --> 02:06:42,859
using it? It's been actually fantastic. It's been a great weapon. It's helped. It's been amazing.

597
02:06:42,859 --> 02:06:47,560
It's been, it's actually been a really good weapon. It's a great weapon. Why would I check it up?

598
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:55,670
It's low to mid. Whatever. It's a great, it's a great weapon. It's a good weapon.

599
02:06:56,550 --> 02:07:28,649
I like it. Guardian's Garrison. Oh my god, there's another fucking dog. Okay. Okay. Okay. We've got

600
02:07:28,649 --> 02:08:14,069
him. Okay. What the fuck? I can't fucking do it. What's happening? Somebody get in there and die.

601
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:30,949
This is the most chaotic, sloppy piece of shit I've ever seen. This is, look at how sloppy this is.

602
02:08:31,029 --> 02:08:39,859
What a sloppy piece of shit that was. That item, I feel like I'm like, oh wow, one, two, three,

603
02:08:39,859 --> 02:08:44,899
four, five. There are five enemies there. Let me like, cast the cloud of raining crystals.

604
02:08:44,899 --> 02:08:59,590
And I just aggro like eight people. I'm, I'm, okay. This is why I don't like using the sorceries that

605
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:06,340
often. Cause you just like stand still and like move one mile per hour to go like this. Cause you

606
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:10,899
really so badly want the move to look cool and to work. And then you just end up aggroing like

607
02:09:10,899 --> 02:09:15,380
fucking 30 people. And then I, oh, I want to like, oh, it's going to kill like those four people.

608
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:20,729
I could have hit those guys three times and they would die. One, two, three, die. Like why do I need

609
02:09:20,729 --> 02:09:29,529
to go like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh dude, it did like 150 damage. Just kill them.

610
02:09:29,529 --> 02:09:56,170
Kill them. Like this. Ready? Watch this. I'm gonna fucking stab it up.

611
02:10:06,409 --> 02:10:12,010
Sucks too. All right. See, it happened to you too. You could have just swung the fucking sword at me

612
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:15,930
twice and killed me. Instead you have to show your chat, like the cool move you have.

613
02:10:17,529 --> 02:10:36,149
And then it got you killed. When are you going to play the real Dark Souls? Like Dark Souls one?

614
02:10:36,869 --> 02:10:49,779
He doesn't know how to dodge. Bro, I beat nobody in the game first try so far. So nevermind.

615
02:10:50,340 --> 02:11:12,979
Time that person up for five minutes though. All right. So what do we got here?

616
02:11:23,399 --> 02:11:33,960
Didn't go through that. Come on. I said, do something funny. I feel like the last five

617
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:39,319
minutes straight have been funny of me trying to like, I feel like that was funny.

618
02:11:40,659 --> 02:11:45,939
Was that not funny? I feel like it could have been funny. I feel like that was funny.

619
02:11:47,859 --> 02:11:57,739
I feel like the last like an hour has been kind of funny because I went on a wild goose chase for an

620
02:11:57,739 --> 02:12:02,869
hour through a thing I didn't even need to do. And like a few people in chat were telling me

621
02:12:02,869 --> 02:12:07,670
that I could have gone another way and I didn't listen to them. And I just literally jumped off

622
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:15,770
a cliff 13 to 14 times in a row. It was kind of funny. It was kind of funny. Oh, you want,

623
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:20,890
you want me to do something funny? Like you want me to like tell a joke? Okay, I get it. Um, sure.

624
02:12:21,689 --> 02:12:38,229
Why did the flame guard, why does this person have a name? What the fuck was that? Uh, why did

625
02:12:38,229 --> 02:13:17,239
the chicken cross the road? To get modded and ban that guy for a day. All right, I need to go up.

626
02:13:17,239 --> 02:13:23,420
He's power hungry. Yes, I am. These late night streams, I swear to god, I'm fucking wrong with

627
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:27,979
me. I promise if you're like a new viewer, I promise I'm not this weird all the time.

628
02:13:27,979 --> 02:13:36,119
Sometimes, but not all the fucking time. Not the whole time. I don't think I think I have to go

629
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:44,010
on the edge. Maybe like up that way. Is there a ladder here? Shit, I didn't see the ladder.

630
02:13:44,810 --> 02:14:00,579
People keep calling you a psycho. What's your response? Um, I don't know. How do I respond to

631
02:14:00,579 --> 02:14:09,699
that? First, I say I just, you know, it's me just hanging out fucking around. And I think I would

632
02:14:09,699 --> 02:14:21,739
say I would, I don't think that's accurate. I would say eccentric. All right, let's check.

633
02:14:27,659 --> 02:14:41,340
Oh, nice. Anybody that calls themselves eccentric is usually, is there anywhere else I can do over

634
02:14:41,340 --> 02:15:02,550
there? Cool. I can get up. All right, go that way. I'm not, no, I'm kidding. I'm not like calling.

635
02:15:03,189 --> 02:15:21,109
I'm just fucking around. Well, a good thing I, I did not know you're in here and you're a way

636
02:15:21,109 --> 02:15:48,920
scarier dog. Jesus, chief guardian. What's this? What the fuck? What was that? All right. That was

637
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:56,680
kind of annoying. That was like one, two, three, but that was quick.

638
02:16:19,739 --> 02:16:28,420
Dogs can't climb ladders, right? That'd be actually kind of funny. It's like somebody

639
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:44,360
mastered the art of becoming a human. Is that me? I have no idea what you're talking about.

640
02:16:58,819 --> 02:17:26,299
These guys give a lot of, uh, souls. Keep going. I'm usually the joker. Yeah. All right. Where does

641
02:17:26,299 --> 02:17:30,700
this guy even come from? Oh, he's here. The whole, all right. I get to go, go, go, go, go,

642
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:44,540
priority priority. Shit. Bad. Very bad. Very bad. Get the souls and just die. I'm alive. I'm

643
02:17:44,540 --> 02:18:00,059
alive. Get me out of this room before he kills me. This is a stupid fire thing. God the fuck out

644
02:18:00,059 --> 02:18:20,299
of here. Oh my God. This guy's got a, it's going to be hard. That shield protects tons of magic

645
02:18:20,299 --> 02:19:07,370
damage. Jesus. That's awesome. Can I have that? It's free. Just spam it. Oh, I'm alive. One-eyed

646
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:18,940
shield. That guy was worth a lot of souls. That was fun. Okay. So what is that? 36 strength.

647
02:19:20,649 --> 02:19:26,440
Great shield. Brick some shield made from white stone depicting a malformed one-eyed god.

648
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:37,379
Barrel of a firearm pokes through the open mouth. Once worshiped by the giants, this evil deity is

649
02:19:37,379 --> 02:19:49,979
believed to have been slammed by Queen Merica. Evil deity. So you get the cannon. This doesn't

650
02:19:49,979 --> 02:19:56,360
require anything besides strength. So that's actually really cool. I wonder how much damage

651
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:01,899
it does when you upgrade it. This one's cool too. This doesn't require faith. This is the big fire

652
02:20:01,899 --> 02:20:13,110
one. This one needs way more strength though. The gun shield. That's cool. Very cool. All right. So

653
02:20:13,909 --> 02:20:23,379
continue. I think that was a pretty good sorcery fight. It does about 2100 damage to adds. Wow.

654
02:20:23,379 --> 02:20:48,409
That's actually pretty good. 2000 damage. I hear a cookie bug. You hear it? I heard it. I swear to

655
02:20:48,409 --> 02:21:10,540
God. I heard it. It's not the rattle. Maybe it's up. Okay. It's probably up. Yeah. I love these

656
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:25,379
Elden Ring streams. I had a great time. I feel like something's going to get up.

657
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:46,500
Giants prayer book. What does that teach you? Giants flame take thee. Flame fall upon them.

658
02:21:47,299 --> 02:21:56,579
I have a feeling that's faith. But that's cool though. Are there any mimic chests in Elden Ring?

659
02:21:56,579 --> 02:22:06,790
Surprisingly no. I guess they didn't. Wait. Can I jump from here? I guess there was uh maybe lore

660
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:14,870
wise. There's no reason to have them but there's like trap chests. Not really. Yeah. I don't know.

661
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:21,030
I haven't really found one. I think I would have seen one by now. All right. Well that's cool.

662
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:38,139
Unless there's something else I can do over here which probably is. Can I do anything else this

663
02:22:38,139 --> 02:22:45,719
way? I don't think so. After you beat it do you think you'll still stream it once in a while? These

664
02:22:45,719 --> 02:22:53,319
streams are really fun. Okay. There's a nightmare. Uh the plan is to so after I beat it whenever that

665
02:22:53,319 --> 02:23:05,270
is I want to do a couple of like kind of co-op like pvp sort of community nights where maybe

666
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:10,600
I'll do the me strong stream. It's possible. But I want to do where I just have a password and we

667
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:16,520
just do pvp. I also want to do just like invasion streams where I just kind of invade or if they

668
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:22,010
turn on invasions just kind of fuck around. I think I pretty much cleared it. Maybe there's

669
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:29,860
something else I didn't see but it's all good. This is like a back entrance. All right the next

670
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:39,959
marking is up here. You have a group password. Um I don't have online turned on right now but I will.

671
02:23:41,399 --> 02:24:00,100
All right let me get out of here. So that is that. Decide on a password right now. Um

672
02:24:02,180 --> 02:24:07,110
I don't have a password. I'm not going to give you a password. I did that. That was cool.

673
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:12,229
I got the prayer book and a couple of little things. Now we're going this way. I want to do

674
02:24:12,229 --> 02:24:23,290
there's a marker that I have over here. Is this the volcano manor thing? This here. The urd tree

675
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:34,819
which is here. Let me put a marker on this because it is done. This is also done. I'm going to put a

676
02:24:34,819 --> 02:24:41,479
marker there just because I there was an item behind that. All right I also need to go down

677
02:24:41,479 --> 02:24:50,870
here at some point. So we'll do that after. Um I'm still looking up here. Go to this point here.

678
02:24:57,799 --> 02:25:02,790
Go to the northern fort. I will. I'm just kind of making my way around. All right we need to go to

679
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:12,139
one. One is the urd tree like that over here. Like and maybe I can't get up here from here.

680
02:25:17,690 --> 02:25:24,420
You look great for somebody with lego hair. Thanks. I hope it stays for another few years at least.

681
02:25:25,219 --> 02:25:33,379
I got no gray hair is really either which is really surprising. I'm happy with the hair right

682
02:25:33,379 --> 02:25:40,899
now. If it takes me into like 40 that'd be great. I've already been this way. It's probably better

683
02:25:40,899 --> 02:26:01,110
to go from here. Unless let's go to this. Who asked? Somebody did. Are you on any hair medication?

684
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:07,819
No. I don't have any. I don't take any like medication for it or anything.

685
02:26:07,819 --> 02:26:15,770
Just there. I am going to assure you though that it's it's not gonna it's gonna go. When it goes

686
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:32,170
it's gonna go. Ah there it is. All right. But it's all right. Whatever. I okay. I did not think

687
02:26:33,340 --> 02:26:40,090
remotely that I was going to have hair for this long. I really didn't. Shack of the law.

688
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:50,940
Traveling maidenhood? Like a maiden outfit? Wood worn by traveling maidens.

689
02:26:51,579 --> 02:26:56,700
Maidens traverse the lands between for different reasons. Some just seek audience with the fingers.

690
02:26:56,700 --> 02:27:01,100
Others to find the tarnished who they were destined to guide. Stop! What's happening over here?

691
02:27:09,739 --> 02:27:31,159
Finger maiden. Traveling maiden. What's the difference? Traveling maiden? Okay. Is there a

692
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:46,840
I do not see. I'm kind of afraid of this. Is there not a grace over here? Okay well I I I

693
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:57,139
there's no grace here. I don't think. What is there one over here? Day one of German not reading my

694
02:27:57,139 --> 02:28:06,700
messages. Start the counter over again. Nothing here. Wait what's that? Okay there might be

695
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:10,620
something right there. I don't want to do this until I have I have too many souls to lose.

696
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:32,379
Let me see if this one right here. What are you doing here? All right let's check and see if

697
02:28:32,379 --> 02:29:03,930
this one here. Is there a grace? All the way up. Did I go in those? Oh shit. I'm going in here.

698
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:09,959
Star gazers ruins. All right well there's definitely a dungeon here.

699
02:29:10,680 --> 02:30:01,559
Maybe not but you know. I did have this marked anyways. I had it marked. Is there you held shut

700
02:30:01,559 --> 02:30:31,290
by a seal? It is this. It's this. It is this. Can I talk? Summon a jellyfish here. Does that do

701
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:57,030
anything? Does it work? These things are like. Did I lose that? A seal was broken. Did I lose

702
02:30:57,030 --> 02:31:16,549
that summon? Still here. Let's just get this shit out of me. Where is it? Oh that's a grovel for

703
02:31:16,549 --> 02:31:35,860
mercy. Curt C? No it's like spin. Where is it? Okay I see it. Okay so now what's down here?

704
02:31:38,680 --> 02:32:03,129
Oh fucking starlight. I'm annoying I think. Primal glintstone blade. Spells consume less

705
02:32:03,129 --> 02:32:17,719
FP but maximum HP is reduced by a lot. Oh my god. This is almost. It's 300. It's not. It's worth it.

706
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:46,489
That's a lot of HP to lose. That's too much HP to lose. That's a lot of HP. Try it. Okay so what does

707
02:32:46,489 --> 02:33:11,899
it do with it all? Is it like 30% or so? I mean it seems significant. Keep in mind the staff that I

708
02:33:11,899 --> 02:33:26,219
have on is makes me. Everything cost more. It's definitely doing a little bit. That's two, three,

709
02:33:27,340 --> 02:33:47,260
four, five, six. Okay so what about with it off? Is it maybe one extra spell? One. It's two extra

710
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:55,500
spells. It's. I can cast two more times. That's actually kind of good. That health reduction

711
02:33:55,500 --> 02:34:01,209
though is really really bad. Where's my health right now? It's like right at the edge of the compass.

712
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:11,000
Oh yikes. That's bad. I'll try it for a little while but I can't promise I'm going to keep this on.

713
02:34:11,639 --> 02:34:20,659
Although. Especially when I start using the other staff. Once the other staff goes on it's reduced

714
02:34:20,659 --> 02:34:28,469
by even more because this staff makes me cast faster but everything costs more. Very cool.

715
02:34:29,690 --> 02:34:40,040
Well that's probably worth it. We'll see. I'm open to trying it. It did replace the

716
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:44,920
FP from killing enemies though which hasn't really been that much of a factor.

717
02:34:45,799 --> 02:34:58,229
I will be honest over the last stream or two. I need to level up because I have enough to put

718
02:34:58,229 --> 02:35:07,100
the new staff on and we're going to commit to it. That was kind of that was kind of ridiculous.

719
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:15,100
All right cool. So now we need to go here. Is there a grace here somewhere though? Come on man.

720
02:35:18,899 --> 02:35:22,180
Can't wait for the Elden Ring vids. Are you going to replace the baby rattle?

721
02:35:22,819 --> 02:35:29,770
At this point I don't know if I can. I have enough probably somber stones or smithing stones

722
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:36,120
to get something like plus seven but I still have not found the final smithing stone yet.

723
02:35:37,000 --> 02:36:03,719
At least for the somber variety. I don't know. I need to be down. Hey what the fuck is it this?

724
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:43,129
Is that is this a boss? Oh my god don't hurt him. He's shooting fucking laser beams at me.

725
02:36:44,010 --> 02:37:58,299
Can I not target him? Come on go. This runs out. Whack him. He's get out of this like fucking

726
02:37:58,299 --> 02:38:24,840
tombstone shit. Get out of there. He's stuck in like the fucking mountain thing. I don't get any

727
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:34,680
soul. Like nothing. Zero. Not even runes. Nothing. Absolute zero. And no item.

728
02:38:34,680 --> 02:39:01,370
Unless it's hidden back here. Okay. So uh don't beast eye quivers. This fucking has so many of

729
02:39:01,370 --> 02:39:17,959
these things. What the fuck? Um what? There's a hundred of them. There was so many of those.

730
02:39:17,959 --> 02:39:31,829
Give me a break. Well I gotta go back there. Okay so that the plan is okay so this is what

731
02:39:31,829 --> 02:39:46,579
happened. I um I uh this is far away. I didn't keep going and trigger the rest of them. That

732
02:39:46,579 --> 02:40:15,219
would have been very a lot more surprising I think. God damn it I have to go all the way around.

733
02:40:15,219 --> 02:40:46,969
There's summons. All right go around. I think I missed that. All the way. I need a race though.

734
02:40:48,120 --> 02:41:10,250
Fuck. Is there one seriously like right here? I feel like down here. I'm looking down here.

735
02:41:12,729 --> 02:41:21,700
Yeah. No no no I need my souls. Why is there so much random shit here? Death right bird? Um

736
02:41:21,700 --> 02:41:32,860
I don't want to lose those souls. I have to run. Was there a grace? Oh my god. Okay grace.

737
02:41:33,659 --> 02:41:42,020
Grace over here somewhere. Not gonna happen. You're not gonna fucking kick me off the edge.

738
02:41:42,020 --> 02:42:32,250
Is there a grace here? It's close. Oh you piece of shit. I was I'm already gotta win.

739
02:42:32,250 --> 02:42:38,969
What is this doing down here? I'm just trying to get away from the stupid giant skeleton people and

740
02:42:38,969 --> 02:42:58,360
this is a giant bird down here with magical power. At least I'm right here. Are you fucking kidding

741
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:13,750
me? Oh I thought that was a grace. I'm killing this thing right fucking now. I'm pissed. Get off

742
02:43:14,229 --> 02:43:16,629
Get off. Yeah get me off. I don't want to I don't want to be on the horse right now.

743
02:43:17,190 --> 02:44:22,090
Fucking move is stupid. It's just like lingers. That move is stupid. It's just like he just grazes

744
02:44:22,090 --> 02:44:26,659
it down and it's just like you can't hit recover from it. It just permanently just

745
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:41,370
That move is fucking stupid. The souls don't matter anymore. It's already over.

746
02:45:17,829 --> 02:46:10,549
Oh my god. They don't explode right? You with that bullshit. Okay maybe I have to be on the horse.

747
02:46:10,549 --> 02:46:27,059
Can you dodge through that? I feel like that lingers. Bring out the snake. See what you got.

748
02:46:32,309 --> 02:46:47,270
Not bad. Does it hurt? He just got fucking staggered. All right well he's cool. The fire

749
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:56,100
is cool though. Oh well. Maybe I do have to stay on the horse. Although I'd rather fight it off the

750
02:46:56,100 --> 02:47:01,270
horse. Maybe get on the horse when he does that move. I don't like fighting stuff on the horse.

751
02:47:02,069 --> 02:47:19,739
Hmm that's bad. I don't like fighting on the horse.

752
02:47:23,610 --> 02:47:27,530
It's like too awkward like the running around on the camera. It's like too hard to keep. I was

753
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:43,290
doing better with it off the horse. Let's try the boys. They're probably just gonna get scared and

754
02:47:43,290 --> 02:48:07,319
run away. All right let's go boys. All right I gotta jump over that. This cameraman is gonna

755
02:48:07,319 --> 02:48:21,530
drive me fucking crazy. Whoa he just started. What the fuck? He wasn't even looking at me.

756
02:48:22,489 --> 02:48:30,520
This motherfucker wasn't even looking at me. He's like oh I'll attack you guys. Now you.

757
02:48:31,239 --> 02:48:44,260
All right this guy sucks. Uh this is gonna be a lot harder than I thought. Strategies. You gotta

758
02:48:44,260 --> 02:48:48,100
hit him in the head. He does that explosion. I gotta see that explosion move again. Otherwise

759
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:54,149
I don't know about this. I could get right up in his ass. Like it takes too long to get over there.

760
02:48:54,790 --> 02:49:41,270
It's better. Where's he? Good job boys. Excellent work boys. Oh my god he's gonna explode.

761
02:49:46,059 --> 02:50:21,620
Me. Who did that? One of the boys literally just stunned him. Holy shit. I don't know which one he

762
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:30,170
did that. Somebody like somebody staggered him. Did somebody actually stagger? Holy shit that was

763
02:50:30,170 --> 02:50:57,450
so important. Wow he sucked. That boss was awful. What is that thing? Where is it? Is it like a staff?

764
02:50:57,450 --> 02:51:05,659
Oh here it is. Ritual spirit used by priests of old who were permitted to come among the death

765
02:51:05,659 --> 02:51:10,469
birds. Priests became guardians of the birds through the rite of death which also serves

766
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:17,239
an oath sworn to their distant resurrection. First the spear high bearing prayers into the sky to

767
02:51:17,239 --> 02:51:36,520
summon a downpour of spectral spears. We need to see what that looks like. Okay. Damn. This does

768
02:51:36,520 --> 02:51:55,190
not use. Oh that's used mana. Okay. I wonder how good that is. So that scales. It's d int d dex but

769
02:51:55,190 --> 02:51:59,799
you need a more. I need strength. It's a little too slow though. That's cool. That's cool.

770
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:08,649
Makes your hat glow. That's really cool. Okay well now I have enough intelligence now. Now I can

771
02:52:08,649 --> 02:52:15,590
get my I got my 70 000 souls back. It's time to get to 60 intelligence and it's time to get this

772
02:52:15,590 --> 02:52:25,959
level the fuck up. That was an intense fight. It's a little like shit that he put on the ground but

773
02:52:28,069 --> 02:52:32,010
boys really pulled through there. If you by the way if anyone's curious

774
02:52:32,889 --> 02:52:37,770
um people like wait those that's a those summons are terrible like that's literally the like the

775
02:52:37,770 --> 02:52:52,780
worst summon in the game and not when they're plus nine and soon to be plus 10 okay it's still

776
02:52:52,780 --> 02:53:00,020
that to do but let me find a grace that's important i don't know if i seriously i don't

777
02:53:00,020 --> 02:53:03,139
know if i did enough damage to do that or if somebody one of them actually did that

778
02:53:04,020 --> 02:53:09,209
maybe with the with the fire the torch it was like tap tap tap tap tap don't maybe i wonder

779
02:53:10,170 --> 02:53:23,350
i actually really don't know to be honest the summons obviously it's like oh yeah the summons

780
02:53:23,350 --> 02:53:29,639
are cool it's the volume right i know it's like oh dude use this one this this person's awesome

781
02:53:29,639 --> 02:53:37,459
we put the serpent out there and i got annihilated not plus nine but still having just five things

817
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:39,399

818
03:02:39,479 --> 03:02:52,120
um i i need to start doing this because okay this is where i was in here i need to my brain

819

822
03:03:34,489 --> 03:03:41,049

825
03:04:35,450 --> 03:04:41,100

826
03:04:41,500 --> 03:04:50,739
so just come here is it is it clean i don't see anything to clean so wait there's

838
03:08:46,579 --> 03:08:52,360
no one uses and you guys are just gonna ruin the rest of my playthrough i'm gonna get to like

839
03:08:53,079 --> 03:08:59,159
one of the hardest bosses in the game and i could have used a different spell but i can't

840
03:08:59,879 --> 03:09:06,340
because i did all the dumb bullshit that everybody told me to do or maybe i can one hit kill one of

841
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:18,840
the bosses with that we kind of cool all right so we're up here it also needs 70 intelligence

853
03:12:32,889 --> 03:12:40,250

855
03:12:52,100 --> 03:12:59,579
family friendly it i will be in a minute wait till the after hours you know when cartoon network

856
03:12:59,579 --> 03:13:05,020
goes to like 11 o'clock they say like swears and shit it's almost there we're there it's a

857
03:13:05,819 --> 03:13:15,450
germa adult swim all right it's like my version of that imagine if somebody did that like from the

858
03:13:15,530 --> 03:13:24,940
hours of i gotta pay attention here in the hours of like you know 12 o'clock noon to like 10 o'clock

859
03:13:24,940 --> 03:13:31,020
at night they're incredibly family friendly they don't say swears they don't play any like mature

860
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:36,940
games but then like 10 o'clock rolls around and they just like saying oh fuck this shit piss

861
03:13:36,940 --> 03:13:42,379
asshole that they talk a bunch of shit they play much immature games that'd be like a funny

862
03:13:43,340 --> 03:14:05,459
it could be like a funny shtick i think that's literally you guys iced my streams of i've

863
03:14:06,100 --> 03:14:33,340
what do you that it makes no sense to me keep going up the boss up there well i know where we're

864
03:14:33,340 --> 03:14:52,790
going okay the legendary item over there it used to be family friendly maybe for like

865
03:14:53,430 --> 03:15:21,100
seven months back in like 2011 he's open okay okay interesting oh great son frigid son of soul

866
03:15:21,819 --> 03:15:25,899
surrender yourself to the eclipse grant life to the soul as bones

867
03:15:26,219 --> 03:15:50,180
so that guy walks in here very okay cool so what what was the weapon that i just found

868
03:15:58,459 --> 03:16:55,670
i lost it again there it is faith in decks storied sword and treasure of castle soul that depicts an

869
03:16:55,670 --> 03:17:01,079
eclipsed sun drained of color one of the legendary armaments

870
03:17:01,719 --> 03:17:14,950
so that guy walks in here very okay cool so that guy walks in here very okay cool so what what was

871
03:17:14,950 --> 03:17:21,100
an eclipsed sun drained of color one of the legendary armaments and so the sight of an

872
03:17:21,100 --> 03:17:27,319
eclipse inspires a dreadful awe preventing an onlooker from averting his gaze that the

873
03:17:27,319 --> 03:17:40,120
lustrous sun ablaze with the prince of death's flames looking the death ailment on foes this is

874
03:17:40,120 --> 03:18:00,420
a broken pvp weapon i can't use it but i'm curious interesting well i'm gonna set the bonfire though

875
03:18:00,420 --> 03:18:09,020
because that unnecessary amount of damage to take legendary shuttle let's just sit at the bonfire

876
03:18:09,020 --> 03:18:14,870
that spell this weapon used to instantly kill is this the thing people were talking about

877
03:18:15,430 --> 03:18:21,879
this is the one that would instantly kill right it was like an unbearable um is he in the room

878
03:18:21,879 --> 03:19:05,860
again it's show till wait nothing over here all right uh i'll go up a little bit it should be

879
03:19:06,659 --> 03:19:19,059
definitely using sorcerers a lot more at the end of the end game here

880
03:19:19,860 --> 03:20:01,079
oh wait a minute can i jump from here no shit around back okay end game he says i mean

881
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:12,020
and oh hold on quiet yeah sure whatever you say dude i would also like to swing

882
03:20:12,020 --> 03:20:17,299
15 times in a row that would be i mean it'd be cool if i could do that if i would have the ability

883
03:20:17,299 --> 03:20:50,940
to do that many swings in a row try that again did i go this way yet yeah this is where i went right

884
03:20:50,940 --> 03:21:08,700
i am this annoying guy this is the worst enemy in the whole game well i need to be much more

885
03:21:08,700 --> 03:21:28,250
prepared for that then maybe i should use a shield to prepare him oh you know what what am i talking

886
03:21:28,250 --> 03:21:42,760
about i am a sorceress good luck the best part about being sorcery is you can just cheese the

887
03:21:42,760 --> 03:21:55,020
fuck out of everybody i don't have to fight this guy somebody else can goodbye see you i don't have

888
03:21:55,020 --> 03:22:05,350
to deal with that right this is why sorcery and faith is just so good they're just great

889
03:22:05,909 --> 03:22:11,379
because i can just go run up the ladder and hide and i don't have to like be imagine being just

890
03:22:11,379 --> 03:22:20,440
like a like a deck strength quality build you'd be up there throwing fire pots i think i already

891
03:22:20,440 --> 03:22:29,559
i'm wearing this already except is this the work better version of it how is this one better i

892
03:22:29,559 --> 03:22:54,469
found it like three zones ago okay that's all i can do up here hold on hold on a second just a

893
03:22:54,469 --> 03:23:22,979
second on a second it's down here i mean that's a really suspicious place to put that if there's

894
03:23:22,979 --> 03:23:31,799
nothing here all right oh it's just it's just the other side okay well i wanted to come down

895
03:23:31,799 --> 03:23:36,120
anyways because actually let me now i'm not gonna set the bonfire why would i do that

896
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:47,739
i want to go this way and i'm gonna go up how come you're wearing mommy's beach hat

897
03:23:58,489 --> 03:24:09,719
mommy's beach hat i wanted to go up from here so i don't get sunburned yeah so i don't get burnt

898
03:24:10,280 --> 03:24:39,079

900
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:12,229
am i still too far away i killed the guy that was the distraction

901
03:25:13,750 --> 03:25:42,010
holy shit oh my god oh my god i keep timing it so fucking wrong

902
03:25:51,190 --> 03:25:59,379
what the fuck there's another one right there holy shit oh my god what the fuck why there's

903

so many of these fucking things okay what a pain in the ass whatever that's so annoying

904
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:29,819
uh should i maybe i should put a shield on just hold it out do a t-break all right if i

905
03:26:29,819 --> 03:26:37,829
if i get past this area i'll do a t-break won't be long now i know no i know it's there

906
03:26:38,469 --> 03:27:20,180
i could go that way too but i need the souls i could run by him what do i do there's nothing

913
03:27:57,420 --> 03:28:01,100

914
03:28:01,100 --> 03:28:09,139

915
03:28:09,139 --> 03:28:23,700
the souls are gone so fucking whatever who cares this ball this area is just like a middle finger

916
03:28:23,700 --> 03:28:28,500
to the player it's just like yeah i just whatever you just every corner you turn there's gonna be

917
03:28:28,500 --> 03:28:56,569
like fucking something that just spawns in front of your face i see the elevator which i believe

918
03:28:56,569 --> 03:29:04,170
was down here i probably could go back to the front entrance if i step on that i'll go right

919
03:29:04,170 --> 03:29:16,809
up there right i have to pull the lever you have to activate it all right well i'm just gonna run

920
03:29:16,809 --> 03:29:23,989
over there well i don't i don't know i don't like this area fuck this area fuck the dual welding

921
03:29:23,989 --> 03:29:33,030
fucking assholes that kill you in fucking three hits and don't stop swinging good look i don't

922
03:29:33,030 --> 03:29:44,139
give a shit i don't think you can actually fight these guys i don't think you can physically fight

923
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:50,549
i think they're they're they're designed to be like obstacles there there are obstacles in the

924
03:29:50,549 --> 03:29:59,540
arena it's like a spike trap you can't even pop you can't even hide okay well i got the

925
03:29:59,540 --> 03:30:11,829
thing so i'm gonna go the other way you literally stagger them good luck getting a swing off and

926
03:30:11,829 --> 03:30:30,260
if you miss you're dead try rolling no no quiet i'm not gonna hear this quiet okay so the elevator

940
03:35:00,299 --> 03:35:11,780
okay here's the play play is drink this going from here now the play is to drink that um

941
03:35:15,079 --> 03:35:27,819
shit drink the thing to make infinite spells and then spam that moon blade and try to kill the guy

942
03:35:27,819 --> 03:35:48,420
on the right first as fast as i can i do i also have access to the boys do i okay if i have access

943
03:35:48,420 --> 03:35:53,979
to the boys then i'll do it i'm gonna drink this before going in the room right when i go in the

944
03:35:53,979 --> 03:36:03,139
room some of the boys and then just spam the moon blade and hopefully i kill the guy on the

945
03:36:03,139 --> 03:36:08,920
right before he even gets over to me well i think i'm safe right it's not do i have to run away

946
03:36:08,920 --> 03:36:13,000
from anybody no thank god at least they have the decency to make it so you don't have to fight one

947
03:36:13,000 --> 03:36:39,000
of those guys on the way here all right here we go all right boys get out of the way oh he's going

948
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:55,340
ahead all right it worked it worked to work good call good call we're good all right get him all

949
03:36:55,340 --> 03:37:44,149
right holy shit what does that mean holy fuck oh no no no no no no no no way oh no okay it was a

950
03:37:44,149 --> 03:37:58,100
good strategy that's how i'm gonna play that out that's a good strategy it is it was boys

951
03:37:59,159 --> 03:38:08,860
flask i gotta wait to spam it though i was a little early i think i can drink the flask

952
03:38:08,860 --> 03:38:22,440
after summoning the boys no no no no why would i do that because the boys will be free because i

953
03:38:22,440 --> 03:38:27,239
i thought he summoned him instantly so he takes a minute he's like here i go i'm gonna summon so i

954
03:38:27,239 --> 03:38:36,120
just get in there um drink the flask summon the boys and then by that point that should be good

955
03:38:36,760 --> 03:38:46,899
it took a lot longer to summon those two than i thought that's why i did it instantly

956
03:38:47,700 --> 03:39:21,979
okay here we go here we go oh okay did i get him only one got left all right we're fine good good

957
03:39:24,309 --> 03:39:44,500
dude what the fuck man come on get him we're good all right he does a follow-up it's a follow-up

958
03:39:44,500 --> 03:40:04,840
swing dude it's he does two follow-ups after that i might have to get rid of this spell now

959
03:40:05,479 --> 03:40:24,819
shit hold on back it up all right you gotta get away you don't want to be near this guy for more

960
03:40:24,819 --> 03:40:52,569
than a second okay all right all right all right you gotta jump no you don't i don't know oh my

961
03:40:52,569 --> 03:41:13,780
goodness all right i gotta be quicker i gotta be much quicker timing's on that i got it wrong a

962
03:41:13,780 --> 03:41:38,090
little bit no no not good not good i think you just need to get out oh okay all right all right

963
03:41:39,290 --> 03:41:47,639
so here's what has to happen when he does that like dash in swing i don't think there's enough

964
03:41:47,639 --> 03:41:56,090
time to do the carrying sword even if i get like a perfect dodge because it's like it takes a little

965
03:41:56,090 --> 03:42:01,819
bit too long to be able to dodge that second like boom attack so i'm not going to use it i'm just

966
03:42:01,819 --> 03:42:12,340
going to use my weapon use the mimic tier i mean the boys are doing great i got it i got it it's

967
03:42:12,340 --> 03:42:21,020
just the timings i just i it's all about when he does that dash in i think it's just a single r2

968
03:42:21,739 --> 03:42:29,500
or maybe just just just swing at him once and then get away i wonder if i can jump over it

969
03:42:30,139 --> 03:42:36,520
can i jump over that attack when he goes like boom with the lightning can i jump i think i can

970
03:42:43,670 --> 03:42:50,500
maybe even um winston i'll try it i definitely need to use this in the very beginning there's

971
03:42:50,500 --> 03:43:01,129
no way i can do this about it just have to get away we'll try let's go i i felt like that was

972
03:43:01,129 --> 03:43:04,889
pretty close although i feel like at least a few of these attempts are going to get really

973
03:43:04,889 --> 03:43:08,819
fucked up by this part here just not killing these things fast enough

974
03:43:25,879 --> 03:43:51,690
get the fuck away from me but hey what's he doing all right here we go does it two three times

975
03:43:52,489 --> 03:44:02,860
hard to tell actually not that bad but once the boys are gone i'm gonna be in trouble here

976
03:44:03,659 --> 03:44:35,909
fuck no again okay let's go that timing on that i gotta get it right it's a lot longer

977
03:44:36,790 --> 03:45:02,899
no i don't think i could even do an r1 shit i'm in the fucking wall here maybe just one r1 and get

978
03:45:02,899 --> 03:46:45,700
out okay that works damn once his friends are gone it's just about the timings damn that was

979
03:46:45,700 --> 03:46:56,700
crazy that's fun but holy that beginning my god okay if you don't have if you don't have sorcery

980
03:46:56,700 --> 03:47:01,989
do you just have to run around and just kite that around so you can kill those two i can't imagine

981
03:47:01,989 --> 03:47:09,690
that as a strength user that must be unfucking that must be unbearable as like a melee only

982
03:47:09,690 --> 03:47:15,450
character how are you supposed to do that that seems impossible strength is fine it seems so

983
03:47:15,450 --> 03:47:38,200
hard that was cool all right we're good god damn oh someone's gonna carry that yeah he just sits

984
03:47:38,200 --> 03:47:52,010
back and will buff until you attack him really all right now we can finally do the staff but

985
03:47:52,010 --> 03:48:05,030
hold on this probably there's probably some lore shit in here that was a cool fight though i just

986
03:48:05,959 --> 03:48:11,940
do not look forward to doing that as like a short sword character i feel like that would be really

987
03:48:11,940 --> 03:48:24,579
difficult hold on wait don't just run around oh the weapon yeah let's see what it was what was it

988
03:48:24,579 --> 03:48:43,270
what kind of weapon was it is it right here veterans prosthesis strength index

989
03:48:44,229 --> 03:48:53,420
like a fist weapon yeah bladed prosthetic leg and wreath with the power of lightning

990
03:48:54,340 --> 03:49:00,870
instead attached to the fist commander niel veteran of castle soul offered this prosthesis

991
03:49:00,870 --> 03:49:05,989
in exchange for the lives of defeated knights held prisoner he went on to lead these men as an army

992
03:49:05,989 --> 03:49:17,819
of no nation storm kick and use it like oh it's that thing he was doing oh that's actually kind

993
03:49:17,819 --> 03:49:42,489
of cool that's pretty cool all right we can go pee in just a moment i promise i want to see what

994
03:49:42,489 --> 03:49:55,590
else is here and then we might consider wrapping up soon not right this second but soon i would

995
03:49:55,590 --> 03:50:05,979
say maybe like another hour we'll see after we get this lore dump whatever it is we'll uh we'll take

996
03:50:05,979 --> 03:50:11,110
a break i'll come back maybe stream for like an hour or two maybe i don't want to go too too long

997
03:50:11,670 --> 03:50:40,500
so what's up here halig tree secret medallion left lord nicola forgive me the sun has not been

998
03:50:40,500 --> 03:50:46,950
swallowed our prayers were lacking the comrade remains soulless i will never set my eyes upon

999
03:50:46,950 --> 03:51:02,729
it now your divine halig tree okay well i have half of the halig tree medallion

1000
03:51:06,420 --> 03:51:18,889
very interesting kind of curious what that is join medallions to operate grand lift of roles

1001
03:51:19,530 --> 03:51:25,420
branching the medallion with both halves can join will have activate the grand lift of

1002
03:51:25,420 --> 03:51:30,860
rolled granting access to a hidden path in other words the secret medallion will guide the bearer

1003
03:51:30,860 --> 03:51:55,979
to the land of michaela's halig tree what is a halig tree it's a special tree okay well very

1004
03:51:55,979 --> 03:52:11,770
interesting uh the game wants me to go down here so here's what we're gonna do i am going to take

1005
03:52:11,770 --> 03:52:23,819
a pee break we're gonna go here we're going to check out this area preferably maybe this right

1006
03:52:23,819 --> 03:52:32,729
here maybe take a little gander over here and then ultimately i want to end up in there so let's

1007
03:52:32,729 --> 03:53:04,780
mark that you have the other half i don't think so i have this one please have to pee right now

1008
03:53:04,780 --> 03:53:07,260
all right now i know we're doing it and when i come back i'm going to do the staff

1009
03:53:08,540 --> 03:53:12,540

1011
03:53:19,079 --> 03:53:24,889

1013
03:53:30,010 --> 03:53:34,329
stream for another day or two i don't know i'm kind of up in the air depends on how much of how

1018
04:00:13,260 --> 04:00:43,110
what okay apparently not what was that you got invaded why did that just happen this late

1019
04:00:45,770 --> 04:00:53,610
is that why i fucking destroyed it that was just like one two three oh it's oh it's from the

1020
04:00:53,610 --> 04:01:15,479
medallion okay that makes sense all right what is it an arm it was like a bone arm where the

1021
04:01:15,479 --> 04:01:24,219
fuck is it oh there it is arcane and decks clinging bone horrific weapon made of a hardened

1022
04:01:24,219 --> 04:01:31,610
skeletal arm wielded by ensha of the royal remains fitted by placings one to hands with fists

1023
04:01:31,610 --> 04:01:40,809
until it digs in a clinging creature a king relinquishes not the hand doing this irl is cool

1024
04:01:40,809 --> 04:01:47,290
what is doing look at me that's cool this is our ass goes with arcane okay well that was weird

1025
04:01:47,850 --> 04:02:09,209
interesting it's the person that's been staring at me the entire video game what was that for

1026
04:02:09,850 --> 04:02:33,559
helm grace with gold human bones worn by the unspeaking adherent of sir gideon the all-knowing

1027
04:02:33,559 --> 04:02:40,360
slowly replenishes hp when hp is reduced bones belong to an ancient lord the soulless king the

1028
04:02:40,360 --> 04:02:59,129
lord of the lost and desperate who was known as ensha ancient lord term of twerk talk to gideon

1029
04:03:01,770 --> 04:03:11,930
you what is it about ensha what is for that nasty business and she got rather ahead of himself it

1030
04:03:11,930 --> 04:03:22,010
seems as his master liked to express my regret but now ensha is slain and gone finished forever

1031
04:03:22,010 --> 04:03:31,829
more ah yes by way of apology allow me to tender some advice in regard to the half of the secret

1032
04:03:31,829 --> 04:03:39,030
medallion you possess find the village of the albin oryx it lies to the southwest of leonia

1033
04:03:39,030 --> 04:03:44,389
below the alter clifflands and some of the old village folk have hidden the secret medallions

1034
04:03:45,030 --> 04:04:02,920
somewhere dude i i've already done it i did it already i said the southwest of leonia what the

1035
04:04:02,920 --> 04:04:09,459
fuck is happening in chat write that down i'm not writing down the pot dance all right so

1036
04:04:09,459 --> 04:04:14,420
there i this i could do that but the most important thing right at this very moment

1037
04:04:15,670 --> 04:04:21,559
is well isn't it i thought wait first of all let me ask this i thought you couldn't fight in here

1038
04:04:31,290 --> 04:04:37,670
you're not supposed to wait so that's up so they just broke the rules it's not that you

1039
04:04:38,229 --> 04:04:44,760
special thing it was bizarro world okay go get the medallion all right just wait wait listen

1040
04:04:45,899 --> 04:04:52,780
i need to do this first because this is important i need a somber smithing stone don't i i do okay

1041
04:04:54,620 --> 04:05:07,719
somber smithing stone l stream l gamer we could do all this other stuff the next stream don't i mean

1042
04:05:07,959 --> 04:05:17,299
look we're not rushing through the game how much is the somber smithing stone one three

1043
04:05:17,940 --> 04:05:36,309
doesn't the giant sell it giant sells them over here right nice sells one through four maybe i

1044
04:05:36,309 --> 04:05:49,059
should buy a bunch i don't think i have i have nine twos two threes i'm gonna need a few of these

1045
04:05:52,010 --> 04:05:59,819
right because i have up until eight to get to plus eight so i need some more fours and i need some

1046
04:05:59,819 --> 04:06:07,739
more threes as well right or is it is one per upgrade oh that's right it's not like the regular

1047
04:06:07,739 --> 04:06:20,620
smithing stones one two three four i'm gonna sneeze i had nowhere to go oh wait you have

1048
04:06:20,620 --> 04:06:48,520
something to say about this and think of myself a capable war counselor i'll catch up with you

1049
04:06:48,520 --> 04:07:02,649
soon enough did you pass up that talisman i didn't even look at it oh is fp consumed by skills what

1050
04:07:02,649 --> 04:07:18,709
holy shit that's pretty good all right okay i can do this now it vastly raises max fp raises

1051
04:07:18,709 --> 04:07:26,700
intelligence spells consume less fp raises potency of sorceries so why would i use this if i have this

1052
04:07:26,700 --> 04:07:52,870
one right i get my hp back because the skill is not a spell what a waste reload the area reload

1053
04:07:52,870 --> 04:08:18,649
the area okay good thing i bought the fucking one smithing stone instead of buying like a hundred

1054
04:08:26,489 --> 04:08:44,280
oh what's wrong with them can i talk to every little area again what is going on in this world

1055
04:08:44,840 --> 04:09:05,959
i don't get it easily broken and weak in striking attacks formed by those committed to high treason

1056
04:09:07,190 --> 04:09:15,180
it wards off the intervention of the greater will and its vessel fingers wards off the intervention

1057
04:09:15,180 --> 04:09:30,860
of the greater will well shit all right what was what's why these people what's wrong with

1058
04:09:30,860 --> 04:09:42,870
these people what's going on it's tinfoil hat okay very nice let's now go back to the

1059
04:09:43,670 --> 04:09:57,670
round table did you go to celavus's tower too let me do this first i'm not gonna be able to get

1060
04:09:57,670 --> 04:10:04,579
this up that high i don't think but i'll i'm gonna use all the stones that i have finally it only

1061
04:10:04,579 --> 04:10:14,600
took four hours only took four hours here we go finally that's the wrong one isn't it no it's not

1062
04:10:14,600 --> 04:10:28,680
okay here we go plus one two plus three plus four plus five plus six plus seven plus eight

1063
04:10:29,399 --> 04:10:40,500
this is now 274 262 this is better this thing scales on strength weirdly enough

1064
04:10:45,959 --> 04:11:02,200

1161
04:32:48,170 --> 04:32:54,100
to go back to normal i've been really itching to continue to play this game so but i'm going to

1162
04:32:54,100 --> 04:33:02,950
put a lid on it because i want to start saturday at like four normal time not start at like 8 30

1163
04:33:02,950 --> 04:33:11,939
i'll go get auto i'll be right back we'll show auto for a minute for a second or two we'll have

1164
04:33:11,939 --> 04:33:16,680
yeah i'll be right back let's put this on at least until i come back thank you for watching everybody

1165
04:33:16,680 --> 04:33:22,020
really appreciate it we'll come back with auto and go grab him thanks for all the subs

1166
04:33:22,020 --> 04:33:31,299
there were a lot of community subs tonight thank you guys as always as you know though i

1167
04:33:31,299 --> 04:33:50,939
do not read subs really or bits anymore i do not on pretty rare occasions do i do that i used to

1168
04:33:50,939 --> 04:34:00,409
that's okay i missed the post stream hangouts yeah but they were they just they had to go they

1169
04:34:00,409 --> 04:34:07,669
really did i told you the two or three reasons why right it's you know you got i don't want

1170
04:34:07,669 --> 04:34:12,139
people to like pay me money for me to like read a message and talk to them

1171
04:34:12,139 --> 04:34:16,380
right it's like oh yeah it costs five dollars to get me to read your message guaranteed and

1172
04:34:16,380 --> 04:34:25,259
respond to it i don't i'm not into that i don't i don't want to do that anymore um as well as the

1173
04:34:25,259 --> 04:34:32,860
fact that we used to do the channel's gotten a lot larger too so it's just there might be so

1174
04:34:32,860 --> 04:34:37,270
many messages that might take hours and hours it already did a lot of times take an extra one to

1175
04:34:37,270 --> 04:34:42,139
two hours at the end of every stream so if i streamed for like four or five hours a lot of

1176
04:34:42,139 --> 04:34:47,189
times i would cut the streams shorter because i knew there was probably an hour or two left of

1177
04:34:47,189 --> 04:34:54,569
kind of reading uh messages and bits and stuff so now i i can just kind of go as long as i really

1178
04:34:54,569 --> 04:35:01,990
want to and there's not like a thing in the back of my mind that says dude you gotta be aware that

1179
04:35:01,990 --> 04:35:08,340
you gotta have enough energy to do like an hour or two at least of reading the bits that kind

1180
04:35:08,340 --> 04:35:12,490
of stuff combined together all the hell stuff like it was sitting down for more than seven to

1181
04:35:12,490 --> 04:35:18,740
eight hours was kind of too much for me at some point right i do appreciate it i do appreciate

1182
04:35:18,740 --> 04:35:27,479
anybody that gives this channel subs or gives any money to this you know as you know at this point

1183
04:35:27,479 --> 04:35:34,740
you the subs on this channel are there's a lot and i don't think i need to tell you guys to

1184
04:35:34,740 --> 04:35:39,209
continue to do that i don't think i need to tell you like oh yeah here's the incentive for giving

1185
04:35:39,209 --> 04:35:43,849
me money like i don't think i need to have that i don't think i don't really want that anymore

1186
04:35:43,849 --> 04:35:55,220
that's pretty much all there is to it if somebody wants to give me five dollars a month i'm not i'm

1187
04:35:55,220 --> 04:36:01,349
not going to stop them i'm not going to necessarily uh like encourage people to

1188
04:36:01,349 --> 04:36:04,549
oh yeah give me like 20 bucks and i'll read like two or three things that you said at the end of

1189
04:36:04,549 --> 04:36:13,020
the stream yeah just give me that money i'll i'll read it that's gonna be gone forever but uh let me
