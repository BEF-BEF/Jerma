1
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:31,989
Hello, hey man. Hey, what's up? I didn't do my tweet yet. Oh, you said hi there. I

2
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,289
thought that was an invitation. Well I see I said hi there because you said you

3
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:41,329
had me say hello so I was responding to myself before you. What are you talking

4
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:46,689
about? What do you mean? You just you have like a soundboard that says hello?

5
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:53,780
Can I at least give you a new one? A new hello? Yeah. That one's old. I don't like it. I don't

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:02,390
know if I have it set up correctly right now. Say something. Hello. I don't have it

7
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,010
set up right. Do you really want me to take the moment and get the new hello?

8
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:20,980
No, no. God no. Oh, God no. Why not? Why do you do a folder on your computer

9
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,500
that's just Jerma saying hello? Wow, ego on this guy. It's also Ashley and Ronnie

10
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,609
and I think someone else. It's just a randomized hello from multiple people. Oh

11
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:41,900
it's randomized. Okay. All right. Let me tweet in as a TF2 with stirliftsfood 2014

12
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:52,900
time machine active. That looks good. Looks good to me. It does. Okay. Hi stir.

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,260
How are you? I'm good. How the heck are you? Headshots. I'm going crazy with the

14
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,579
headshots in my chat still saying lol aim for the head. So good luck today pal.

15
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,260
All right. So are we gonna be on a team together and we're gonna queue for team

16
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:18,539
Fortress 2. Are we? Yeah. Can we please God? All right. You want to just do I have to

17
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,780
wait for you to be done? No, I can leave. Are you ready? Like now? Or are you ready?

18
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,500
Like already? I'm hold on. I didn't say I didn't do my like intro. Shut up. Shut

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:36,129
up. Shut up. I'm ready. Can you invite me? Yeah. I should be able to be invited to a

20
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:45,280
game. You just have to be appearing online. I mean, uh, my God, there's there.

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,120
There. There throw a tantrum there. I'm on. Is your name like it's a break the

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:08,419
fish. You'll find it. You have to be in the game. I'm in the game. Well, it

23
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:16,599
didn't work. Why not? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Are you me? Yes. All right. I think

24
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:26,979
it's gonna happen. I said I said yes. I said I clicked on play game. Sure. What's

25
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:41,490
happening after rejoin? Maybe let me try inviting you. You have to do it from the

26
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:55,449
main menu, not the steam invite. Oh shit. I disabled my entire friend panel in the

27
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:07,900
config file. Hold on. Okay. How come I have this thing next to my name? You know

28
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,780
you carry on. I'll get this figured out. I'll get this figured out. I downloaded a

29
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,500
custom HUD and shit and I fucking deleted the whole friend panel. You need

30
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:27,060
the friend panel. Hold on. Here's the bigger question though. Why? How come on

31
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,100
my steam is permanently broken? What do you mean permanently broken? I can't

32
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,139
ever be invited to what's going on with my voice. Why did you do this? I can't

33
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,259
get invited to any games. Nobody can ever invite me. This is I'm like

34
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,259
permanently blocked forever. You might be shadow banned, but this one again is

35
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,180
not like technically steam invites don't work. This is from the main menu. All

36
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,810
right. Give me a second. I can invite you in two seconds. Yeah. Maybe you have your

37
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,129
privacy on no friends. I'm ashamed of my friends and I didn't want their names to

38
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:07,100
wait a minute. Wait a minute. You don't want your friends like furry avatars to

39
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:12,100
No, it's just like you get like 7,000 friend requests that you steam did this

40
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,740
thing where you could never like stop that from happening. You remember that?

41
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:23,100
No, no. I remember having so many friend requests that you actually couldn't send

42
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,800
anymore and I left it that way so that I wouldn't get anymore and every time I

43
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,259
wanted to actually let someone on my friends list I had to like ignore and

44
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,060
deny one person. Otherwise they couldn't send a friend request because steam

45
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,939
couldn't handle it. Going through the console command? No, we have to be in a

46
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:47,509
party as we queuing up casual. Let me take one second and see if there's like

47
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,750
something fucked up in my steam because I got a problem. If your chat tells you

48
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,149
to do something they're telling you how to do it from the perspective of it's

49
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:00,990
2010. That's true. Hold on. So when they tell you like oh do the Sandman canteen

50
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:13,029
combo, it'll be fun. Don't listen to them. Yeah, like friends. I'm just gonna turn

51
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:17,829
the panel back on just to add you. I don't care. Yeah. I don't know why

52
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:23,509
like I just can't ever be invited anywhere. My steam profile is private but

53
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:31,720
yours is too, isn't it? No. Oh, maybe that's why. Yeah, friends only. My basic

54
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,129
details are public. That's fine. Profile friends. Do you remember one and a half

55
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,610
hours ago when I asked if you wanted to like test anything or anything else we

56
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,129
could do before? Well I didn't know that this was gonna be an issue. First time I

57
00:06:45,129 --> 00:07:00,240
opened this game in like 10 years. What if I do this? All right, let me try that.

58
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:11,569
If that helps. That could fix it. If this doesn't work then just join a game and

59
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,009
I'm gonna change a few options in my. It actually says you're playing TF2 now

60
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:23,660
which is a step up. Oh it does. I don't think it was before. Oh, I fixed it. Do you like that we

61
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:33,620
both have default medic icons? Oh we do. We do both have default

62
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:42,959
medic icons. That's kind of funny. Great minds think alike. Yeah they do. Okay, you

63
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:50,300
joined a community server is what it's saying. Okay, well it's the thing for the

64
00:07:50,300 --> 00:08:01,519
decal thing. Oh, okay. I thought okay. All right, we good? Yes. So you should be

65
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,430
able to invite me now. I sent you to the invite to the party and it instantly

66
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,230
disappears and it does not show you as inviteable. It like instantly just

67
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:18,509
closes. Why? Why the fuck is this happening? All right. You invite me.

68
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,110
You just go. Let me figure this out. I don't know. You invite me. I know but I

69
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,910
have to like re-enable my friends panel. Okay, well can we talk about like

70
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,120
sausages or something? Well, if you want. What do you want to talk about? Um, I

71
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,559
don't know. Like when do you think civilization started? I think that is a

72
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,679
lot of things during the pyramid times and maybe even before the pyramids. Where

73
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,080
there is, we already talked about this. You didn't just immediately say sauce.

74
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:57,620
Has your opinion changed? Um, hold on. I can't do two things at once. Give me a

75
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,139
little bit of slack. Hey, when you first opened TF2 after like eight years, you

76
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,379
probably spent like a long time figuring this out. And that's why I offered to

77
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,139
help. Yeah, but then you all but you offered to help but then you set up

78
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:12,179
starting early and you ran away and turned your stream on. And I was like, I

79
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:23,580
thought he was gonna help me. You did do that. You did say that. Not quite that.

80
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:34,600
Yeah, you did do that. You did say that. Yep. Okay. Let me just re-enable this. So

81
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,200
what is of all the new maps? There's like 30 new maps, right? The best map that

82
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:49,659
everyone talks about is the meme map with the seal on it. Okay. And then

83
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:58,320
there's like upward and. Are you just playing like the old map still? Um, I

84
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,259
have it queue me into the new maps. A mix of both. Okay. I like Phoenix. Phoenix's

85
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:15,549
first point is pretty cool. Did they add anything else? I saw like the cases. Like

86
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,750
I opened it for a second to see. They added an official versus Saxton Hale mode

87
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,070
and it's actually not that bad. As someone who never really liked Saxton

88
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,950
Hale. He has like three abilities he can use and it's a whole like set up for it.

89
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,669
Okay. Give me. I'm gonna mute for a second. Did you hear what I just said? I did.

90
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,870
It's Saxton Hale stuff. Yep. Let's go. Okay. No, I'm just checking. I'm listening

91
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,669
but I'm like I have to go in like the command list shit. Let me see. Yeah. You

92
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:53,240
just you answered in a very dismissive manner. What's going on with this? Oh, that's

93
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,299
right. That's wrong thing. Hey. Okay. I should be able to do it now. Cool. I got

94
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:04,379
to play for 10 seconds. I got to. No, no, no, no, no, no. Like just just hang out.

95
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:15,370
Make sure it works first. Oh, sure. I shouldn't have to leave to get it. It's

96
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,409
been 10 years. Don't worry. We'll do a full intro. We'll do like a whole door.

97
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:24,909
Everyone can relax. I'm gonna do a full intro. We're gonna be. It's gonna be a

98
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:28,149
huge deal. It's gonna be a bunch of fucking cool stuff happening. Just wait.

99
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,710
Just hold on. It's been 10 years. What's up, guys? I didn't even take the splash

100
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,429
screen down. That's just how much I haven't really done. I mean, it's another

101
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:48,330
late night live commentary with German 985. Tonight, I'm going to be playing

102
00:11:48,330 --> 00:12:08,149
as. Oh, wait. No, I'm going to be waiting. All right. Joe, Joe, I can join

103
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:17,440
your party. I do that. Can you can you do that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You did it.

104
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:25,929
I'm in. Okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna exit this game. Okay. I am going to kill us

105
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:38,899
or you want to see the new maps? Yes. How does this work? Do you want me to queue

106
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:46,200
for Saxton Hale as well? I we get it. I would like for you to queue us or it is

107
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,080
the new anything. Well, I want to just play Team Fortress for now. You know what

108
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,840
I mean? Okay. I just want to see if you see that's what happens. It's like cool.

109
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,399
There's 14 new maps. And then you join TF2 and you're like, I'm gonna play the

110
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,879
new maps. And then you're like, where's the health kit? Where's the health kit?

111
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,360
Where are they spawning? And you just run around into walls. And it's like this

112
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,559
isn't Team Fortress. I'm confused. Especially if you're like first games.

113
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:17,460
This is fucking cool. Alright, so first of all, let's go over what's going on

114
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,820
today. Today. It's only been like we've been sitting for like 12 minutes. 11

115
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:31,470
minutes. Sorry. Yeah. This is Team Fortress 2. There are honestly I really

116
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,509
we have to do this because it's probably like, no, shut up. Listen to me. No,

117
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,830
you're right. I'm laughing because I'm like, wait, do you know how many people

118
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,049
probably don't play this? This game's older than the people watching. There's

119
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,899
probably a lot of people that have no idea what's even going on. We have to

120
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,779
give a brief explanation of what Team Fortress is. While you explain it, can

121
00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:03,379
you put like subway surfers on the side? No, I'm gonna show the game. If you're

122
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,259
good, you'll get a face cam. By the way, you have to be you guys gonna be good.

123
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,919
Are you ready? Am I joining this? Are we good? We're good. We're joining this. Are

124
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,529
you so ready? We're gonna look at all my points, dude. I would say it is

125
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:24,039
versus Saxton Hale. I don't know this map. Oh, it's versus Saxton Hale. Well,

126
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,799
this will be a good reminder. I don't know. I don't I don't want to play this.

127
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:32,730
I want to play team. Is this Team Fortress? Okay, we're leaving. No, no, no,

128
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,289
no, no, no, no, no. I left. I left. You already started complaining and the map

129
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:44,149
didn't even load yet. Okay. Trust me. All right. So do it again. I'm gonna put

130
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,350
you on a real map. We're gonna do a real map that you're aware of. I just you

131
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,179
like I have I okay, I loaded the game for like maybe 20 minutes and it was

132
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:59,139
just to buy keys. Okay, that's that's what I did. So I need how many did you

133
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:08,740
buy two or 300? Why? What? I made that up. I bought like 15. I don't like being

134
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,210
lied to as a joke. I don't respect that. Whatever happened to honesty. Everyone's

135
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:23,399
always like 15. I got 15. Okay, I don't know. I just like that. I have somebody

136
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,080
crates in my inventory. They don't even know what they are for. They might be

137
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:35,120
like rare. Do you know this map? I mean, I know I have the fucking pyro. Why is

138
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,509
this on? Oh, you're a spy. I can't heal you. You're good luck. All right. So this

139
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:48,639
is way. This is different. Oh, this is this HUD looks cool. I actually like this

140
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,429
HUD. I should customize it a little bit more. Okay, so how do I? Okay, I have a

141
00:15:55,429 --> 00:16:01,970
gas can on. Wait, what's my menu? I don't want that. I want to I don't know what's

142
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,690
good nowadays like the flare gun still. Well, you're not in spawn, so it doesn't

143
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:14,259
matter. Sorry, whatever. I'll go back to change your view model. Is my view model

144
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:26,470
too big? People have been telling me that for like a week. Yeah, they don't know

145
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,809
the real TF2. What people want them the small view models. They make me want to

146
00:16:32,809 --> 00:16:37,090
throw up. They make me upset as a boomer. I'm upset. Maybe the small ones. You

147
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:44,440
mean view model underscore fov. Oh, I hate that too. When you can see their

148
00:16:44,440 --> 00:17:04,299
arms. I'm a purist. Okay, it's going pretty good so far, I would say. Oh, I'll

149
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:07,700
keep it for now. Maybe I'll see how I like it. All right. I don't do I want to

150
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:13,059
play pirate. What do I want to do? What do you want to do? I don't know. What was

151
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,220
your favorite Team Fortress two class in the original Team Fortress two that

152
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,109
we're playing right now? It was this by this by for sure. Really? I'll do quick

153
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:32,289
fix uber saucer. This looks good. Oh, there's a moment. Hey, by the way, stir

154
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:43,119
just want to make sure I let you know. Where are you? Um, I'm dead. All right.

155
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,299
Well, I got a I got a quick fix for you when you get up. Are we doing that? I

156
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:54,140
mean, I'm I'm just healing because we need it. You just said your favorite

157
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:00,339
class was the spy. Why would I play as a spy? I'm a team player. A spy is a team

158
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:12,299
player, but we needed another medical. Okay, I'll come find you. My god. I'm

159
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:22,390
gonna activate over. I love the quick fixes uber. Is that is it bad?

160
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:31,230
I mean, it's it's it's why are you so scared of like what's considered good

161
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,910
and bad? Why can't you like, enjoy yourself? I am enjoying myself. And by

162
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:42,180
the way, I gotta let you know something, Star. It's over. Oh, oh, no, it's over.

163
00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:45,029
Did you get the laugh track stuff?

164
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:53,950
Uh, no. Oh, okay. Well, never mind. I forgot I was supposed to get a laugh

165
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,630
track. I thought you were gonna have like a whole soundboard of like booze

166
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,269
and cheers and laugh track. I forgot. That was the bit I knew. Oh, he helped

167
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,509
me behind you. Not that soldier can pick up the health kit. I'm working on it. Do

168
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,630
this. Do that. Do what I say. I don't have the crits, by the way. If I get

169
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,789
backstabs, your fault. I know. Well, also, you're the medic. It's easier for

170
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,950
you to look around. But okay, now it's not because my beam will get detached.

171
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:29,029
What? Fuck? What? Oh, that's right. I move with you because I have the

172
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,349
fix. Oh, that's cool.

173
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,380
German versus star German versus star.

174
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,940
Everybody wants to see that happen. This is the reunion episode, guys.

175
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,140
Spee, spee, spee.

176
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,180
This stream is going to have like a four on fucking IMDb. Oh, god damn it. I'm

177
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,740
dead. This stream is gonna have like a four on IMDb because it's a reunion

178
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,460
episode. And we're just gonna say the jokes we've always said for like 14

179
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,900
years. And it's just gonna be flashbacks. And my hair is all gray and shit. Like

180
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,700
it's and by the way, it's been like eight years since we've even been on camera.

181
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,210
So I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that. And I lost.

182
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,369
Oh, let me get crits, actually.

183
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,589
Germa, the crits, the crits.

184
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,339
Wait, you want me to scream for the crits?

185
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,259
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

186
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,940
Hey, come on. We're back.

187
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,230
And then after I say that, it cuts like this part of the video, it cuts to like

188
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:31,029
total playtime in the next six months to like four hours and 10 minutes, which is

189
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:31,589
this stream.

190
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,920
Yeah, because you're not a real player.

191
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,759
You're Frank.

192
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,259
You know, it's in lore now that Matic is the soldier's sister.

193
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:43,309
You just die.

194
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,509
I did. I got I got hit right in the face.

195
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:48,819
Oh, dude, we're so back.

196
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,019
I do want to make the HUD a little different.

197
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,339
You can customize the whole thing, right?

198
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,140
This does look better than the default HUD in a way.

199
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,579
I always use the default HUD just because of, I don't know, I always felt like a

200
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,460
custom HUD crashed the game all the time.

201
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,180
But I guess it's been a long time.

202
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:16,420
What game were you playing?

203
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,869
I don't know, but you're doing pretty good.

204
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:20,470
You know what to do, by the way.

205
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,269
Oh, you're healing me.

206
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh, OK. So Team Fortress 2 is a team based shooter.

207
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,109
There's a red team and a blue team.

208
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:32,309
You're probably looking at this and going like, what the heck's going on here?

209
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,910
So the cart, that blue cart is the objective for the blue team.

210
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,349
It is our job to stop them from pushing that object.

211
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,670
Hashtag ad.

212
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,460
All right. You know, hey, you know what you have to do.

213
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,579
Well, let's does this still work?

214
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,140
I haven't had like a medic where I like build Uber for you by damaging myself.

215
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,660
OK, let's go.

216
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,700
Oh, OK. You let me know when you're.

217
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,250
Oh, scout, scout, scout, scout, still alive, scout, still alive.

218
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,769
Oh, that's how you tell we're back.

219
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,289
That's how you can tell we're back.

220
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:20,150
That's how you know we're back.

221
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,950
But behind spy. Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm a liar.

222
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,799
I lied. Liar, liar.

223
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,349
I don't want to pocket you. Why not?

224
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,799
Because that's how a team loses.

225
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,240
You don't have to.

226
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
Also, that's the opposite of true.

227
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,759
Is it? I always want to make sure the other medic is overhealed.

228
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,079
And what's over here?

229
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:50,740
I mean, that's true.

230
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,380
That spy has like 600 health.

231
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,259
Doesn't make any sense.

232
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,450
Kunai. Oh, he could have had Kunai health.

233
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,410
People saying, well, shitty aim, shitty aim.

234
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,849
Hold on. But a lot of people don't even know how this game works.

235
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:08,049
All right. Almost everything in this game is a projectile that he's playing

236
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,730
is mercy from Overwatch.

237
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,089
This game kind of just ripped it off.

238
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,690
You don't like really have to aim.

239
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,130
You just like kind of like put your beam on someone.

240
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,329
And then you say heroes never die.

241
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,809
No, you don't say that because this is Team Fortress.

242
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,460
But see that they have this an arc and it's all a projectile in the server.

243
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,140
And look at how far how long it takes to go to travel.

244
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,859
I see. I mean, everything's a projectile.

245
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:32,180
Skill shots.

246
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,140
Yeah, this game is skill shots only.

247
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:46,549
Oh, hi. Nice.

248
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:51,029
Yeah, this this feels this feels like the game that we played

249
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:54,900
for a very long time. Remember, fake hair everywhere.

250
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,099
That's a classic line.

251
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:58,579
What are the classic lines that we not said is this by

252
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,470
he's bored already?

253
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:07,349
Wow. This was just really like, oh, this is a game I played for years.

254
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,829
Oh, you guys, you guys have heard of this game viewfinder?

255
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,029
Yeah, we might have to take a rain rain check on that game.

256
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,309
Well, I feel like I'm going to play this a lot.

257
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:23,579
This is fun. Oh, he said it.

258
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,609
All right. We got. OK.

259
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:30,769
If you don't get at least seven kills with this, you need to do 10 push ups.

260
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:38,829
Well, I didn't get any with it.

261
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:45,359
But you got to do 10 push ups, bro.

262
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,119
I feel like that's on you to do the push ups.

263
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,269
What? No, I didn't need the crits.

264
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:54,420
Oh, my God. You killed like four people.

265
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:02,099
I got a random one. I got two of it there.

266
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,059
How about like you?

267
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,819
How about I do push ups, but you like lay under me?

268
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,670
Does that even work?

269
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,650
What are you talking?

270
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,650
I've you know, you know, wait, wait.

271
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,569
What? OK, I work out.

272
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:21,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

273
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,970
No, I don't want to die. I don't.

274
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,210
I'm going to kill this heavy.

275
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,529
The way, you know, if you go down a map, maximum depth on a push up.

276
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,529
As if you kiss.

277
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,730
OK, whatever you're saying, I just got I have a full Uber right now.

278
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,490
Where are you? I'm dead.

279
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,490
Well, get back alive.

280
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,490
I'm getting back alive.

281
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,410
I'm coming through a teleport.

282
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,609
I have to create a sniper.

283
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:41,930
Is this a bad? This is bad.

284
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:43,690
Don't do it. I'm behind you. I'm behind you. I'm behind you.

285
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:50,950
It's me. Let me know.

286
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,549
Yeah. You know, the signal.

287
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,089
Hmm. Good.

288
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:03,049
It's one. It's two.

289
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:07,779
Nice. Almost. Hey, we did it.

290
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:13,390
There is no one else to kill.

291
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,380
Hmm. I thought that was a crits noise.

292
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,099
I thought that was a burp.

293
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:21,900
I was convinced you burped.

294
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,220
Maybe you should play spy. You like spy.

295
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,220
I it's going to be so embarrassing.

296
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,779
There's no that's like three spot.

297
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,339
I'll play engineer. Do a stair stab.

298
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,700
I'm going to play engineer for one specific reason.

299
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,299
And I don't know if you're going to be very upset with me

300
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,180
or if you're going to be very happy.

301
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
What's the reason? You'll see.

302
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,009
Yeah, I have to wait one full minute, though.

303
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:50,400
Why? You just you have to wait a minute.

304
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,029
How's the audio? Is the volume good?

305
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,430
Doesn't need to be a little bit louder.

306
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:07,140
A little quiet. Oh, let me.

307
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,059
Oh, shit. I didn't want to do that.

308
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,059
Wait. Oops. OK.

309
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:16,589
Options, audio. That's that's neat.

310
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:19,710
I remember you're like old hat loadouts.

311
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,109
You're playing the self-portrait engineer.

312
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:28,220
Yeah. Oh, shit. You can't see.

313
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,980
All right. So this is why I wanted you to.

314
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,900
You're either going to be very mad or very happy.

315
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,660
We'll find out really shortly here.

316
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,420
Oh, no. Wrong one.

317
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,099
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. Wrong one.

318
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,460
You have to for this. No, no, no. Wrong one. Wrong, wrong, wrong.

319
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:49,289
This one's important.

320
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:54,890
All right, Hank Hill.

321
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,829
Best of luck to you.

322
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,069
This is I love this so much.

323
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,410
You can get backstabbed on the go cart.

324
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,190
Why not? You have what you have a back.

325
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,460
Oh, it should hit the fucking metal.

326
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,019
You know what? I'm changing class.

327
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:17,420
I got a better idea.

328
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,740
I don't want to play engineer.

329
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,660
I want to play fucking heavy.

330
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,819
OK, I'm with you.

331
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,519
All right.

332
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:28,619
But we're going to be engineer friends.

333
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:33,400
OK. Oh, yeah.

334
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,980
Where were you?

335
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,180
I'm I was building a century.

336
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,980
Are you so that you're I saw you.

337
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,140
I get the oh, you saw it already.

338
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,059
I get that you bought every single drivable.

339
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,660
I can shoot the gun.

340
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,069
Yeah. What?

341
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:53,569
It only has five bullets.

342
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:58,140
Wasted them. Pay to win, dude.

343
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,640
Does this actually hurt people?

344
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,819
I don't know, actually.

345
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:09,430
Hey, it has to, right?

346
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,789
It doesn't have to buy by.

347
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Watch your back. He's right here.

348
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,569
Yeah. Fuck you, buddy.

349
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:32,539
That didn't do anything.

350
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:37,880
How do I do that?

351
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,740
It was inevitable.

352
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:48,789
All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

353
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,230
You got to go push that cart.

354
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,630
I would. We could have run for a second.

355
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,519
Hold on. There's a lot of things going on.

356
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,339
You got to push that gear up.

357
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:05,369
I heard steps.

358
00:30:05,369 --> 00:30:06,049
I'm doing it.

359
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:07,009
I'm really doing it.

360
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:09,730
They have a bad ahead of soldier with a conqueror, whatever it is.

361
00:30:12,099 --> 00:30:13,900
A soldier with a brass beast.

362
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,809
Excuse me.

363
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:19,849
The conch, the conch, whatever it is.

364
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:21,329
The soldier with the what?

365
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:24,009
The con the shell, the like

366
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:27,140
soldier with the what are you talking about?

367
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,230
Well, let me let me actually take this off.

368
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,950
I do have some cool items.

369
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,069
I love the Thomas love.

370
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:37,750
It was awesome.

371
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,500
Nana. 50 percent.

372
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,779
Yeah. For those of you that don't know,

373
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,500
Team Fortress 2 has like five thousand items that are different

374
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,980
and can't change the gameplay there.

375
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,460
They are all different now.

376
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,259
Everyone that you remember that was fun is different now.

377
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:55,779
Really? Yes.

378
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:57,140
So much stuff changed.

379
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,779
Oh, my God.

380
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:01,630
Wait, is this 40 percent?

381
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,710
I might have to take a whole stream

382
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,150
just sitting here looking at every item that might have to happen later.

383
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,589
Tell me which one you put on and I'll tell you if it was.

384
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,440
OK. Gloves of running urgently.

385
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,200
I think those are still the same.

386
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,359
Are they the same?

387
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,920
I haven't actually played like no heavy.

388
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,160
Don't ask me about any heavy items. Never mind.

389
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,910
Is this live? Yeah, it's live.

390
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,150
It's late night live.

391
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,549
This is late night live commentary.

392
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:32,789
My hit series. What are you doing?

393
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,779
What are you doing?

394
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,420
Yeah, that Tommy's love is much quicker.

395
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,859
All right. Let's actually I'm going I'm going for it now.

396
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:38,900
I'm going for it. No more fucking around.

397
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,819
No more. Oh, man.

398
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,819
I picked the only time that our team had was not pushing.

399
00:31:48,269 --> 00:31:49,940
And I leave.

400
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,380
What do we actually need?

401
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,140
Why should we need?

402
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,980
Maybe demo. Yeah.

403
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,299
What do we what's my I'm sorry.

404
00:31:58,299 --> 00:31:59,579
I'm just all over the place.

405
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:03,059
That's overwhelming. I forget everything.

406
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,470
Loose cannon was cool. Is that different?

407
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,349
Uh, no. I'll keep.

408
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,730
All right. I'm going to do loose cannon.

409
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,170
What about the shield of the shields?

410
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,210
Any better or different or anything?

411
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,809
Tied Turner makes you go anywhere.

412
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,450
This one's just defense.

413
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,769
I'm going to just do defense.

414
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:27,220
And the donk whatever it is, bonk whatever it is.

415
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,609
Oh, what the fuck?

416
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,609
All my stuff's getting sapped, bro.

417
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,880
Oh, shit.

418
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Teleporter down.

419
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,680
It all went to shit.

420
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,079
That's all right.

421
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm playing one of my favorite items in the game.

422
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:52,359
Everything is about to change for our in our favor.

423
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:55,460
Just get the game behind us.

424
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,650
I'm aware. I'm going to kill this guy.

425
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,069
Oh, I give up.

426
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,150
Don't give up.

427
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,750
I give up on engineer.

428
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,349
I'm going to go back to spawn and get in the little car.

429
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:17,660
Oh, my God. Never back down.

430
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:22,299
Yeah, never back down.

431
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:27,380
So the loose cannon is you have to hit them twice,

432
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,460
once with the directed and then once with the explosion, right?

433
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,059
That's how I remember.

434
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,619
Mm hmm. If you charge it up all the way, you blow yourself up.

435
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,819
Don't do that. People are going to do omega lols.

436
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,180
They I mean, I did definitely omega loling the whole time since I opened the game.

437
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,519
That's why. Well, I'm glad they're having a good time.

438
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:54,880
Oh, oh, omega lol.

439
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,289
I do have a hit sound, I guess you have a hit sound.

440
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:06,470
Yeah. You didn't even ask me for like a hit sound.

441
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,430
No, I do.

442
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,309
I installed a custom HUD for the first time forever.

443
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,789
We would have sat there for like three hours while you tried to explain.

444
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:17,239
Holder in one spot. Oh, I'm the soldier going around.

445
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,760
It's not too late, Jerma.

446
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,679
I can give you a hit sound. You're going to love it.

447
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,510
See if I can get this done.

448
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,630
Oh, I can't take this thing.

449
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,429
Oh, no. Wait, why can I shoot this?

450
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:27,550
Thought I couldn't.

451
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:51,670
The crits. Let's go.

452
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,710
That was a good crits, too.

453
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,699
That was like almost everybody.

454
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,980
They're proud of you.

455
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,719
Oh, we're so back.

456
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,619
We're so back. Oh, I'm having I'm having fun.

457
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,099
Oh, I'm. Are you not having fun?

458
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,820
I am having fun.

459
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,260
I just find it funny that

460
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,099
I'm having fun is code word for what's next.

461
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,219
You know, it's funny to say.

462
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,300
I mean, I've been playing this for like a week.

463
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:36,969
Hold on. Oh, shit.

464
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,860
I'm good. All right.

465
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,139
So if you don't know what's going on there, that weapon.

466
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,150
Dude, there's a lot of people here.

467
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,230
We this is a business.

468
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,070
This game is like our entire you and I.

469
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,309
Can you explain what a spie is?

470
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:59,079
You and I are like entire lives are because this game exists.

471
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,440
You know, you understand.

472
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,889
We need to make sure people understand this.

473
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:08,550
OK, so this thing, when you get a kill with it, you get healed.

474
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:11,550
You get healed 50 percent of your health.

475
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,360
But what? I had a mo.

476
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,409
I'm sorry. That has nothing to do with you.

477
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,449
So but if I take this out and I don't kill someone,

478
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:22,530
this is completely different.

479
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,900
I don't understand how this item works anymore.

480
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,190
Which item? The the toy.

481
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,690
You can't put it away.

482
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,130
No, you will heal if you kill someone.

483
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,809
No, no, no, you're not. It's different.

484
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,090
No. OK, so you get 50 percent base health if you kill somebody.

485
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,050
There are no random crits.

486
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,050
And once you draw this thing, if you put it away,

487
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,900
you get hurt for 50 damage unless you kill somebody.

488
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,940
Oh, OK. That's interesting.

489
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,219
Yeah. Most things have changed.

490
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:51,659
I actually like that better.

491
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:57,719
Hold on. Let me see. Oh, wow.

492
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,400
Oh, shit. Maybe that's why I was getting hurt.

493
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,679
I didn't even know that was happening.

494
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,800
Were you just weapon swapping it? I think so.

495
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:12,460
Yeah. I'll do it.

496
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,780
I'll get my contract going or get five kills as a demo in a single life.

497
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,860
Press F2. Why?

498
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,780
If you if you want to hack, I just want you to see this menu.

499
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,300
OK, F2. Hold on.

500
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,280
I'll do what I'm good.

501
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,280
This is the Deus Ex fucking screen.

502
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:42,610
What the fuck? How is he still alive?

503
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,389
What does a crit do with the melee?

504
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:48,309
Don't say swears.

505
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,579
All right. Press F2 to open up the contract menu.

506
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,690
Yeah. OK. Yeah.

507
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,849
I mean, I did a lot of this when it was relevant, like 10 years ago.

508
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:00,590
It didn't exist 10 years ago.

509
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,840
How long? Yeah, this is like five years ago.

510
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,420
Eight years. It was a long time ago.

511
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,780
They changed it to that during the jungle inferno update, like two years ago.

512
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,860
I must have played for like an hour.

513
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,139
Oh, yeah, I never saw that before. Did I play?

514
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,860
Yeah, I did.

515
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,420
When was jungle inferno, guys?

516
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,539
It was not five years ago. It's two years ago.

517
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,659
There's been so many updates this game. It's hard to keep track.

518
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,579
He was playing off stream.

519
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:34,460
And I played this game for a little bit like two or three years ago.

520
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,780
I must have. No, I did.

521
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,440
I did. I did very briefly.

522
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,000
But like maybe a day or two.

523
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,159
But I immediately dropped it because it was just kind of fucking fucked up.

524
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,780
Jungle Inferno was 2017.

525
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,219
Yeah, that was two years ago.

526
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:51,619
That's right. Two years ago.

527
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,860
That was to 2017.

528
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,730
Yeah, it sounds like two years a long time ago.

529
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:03,039
It's like 2018 now.

530
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,340
Somebody said, hey, dude, is your mouse on gravel?

531
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,469
What do you mean?

532
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:12,070
You mean like like a mouse pad of rocks?

533
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:24,730
Maybe my sensitivity is too high.

534
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:30,510
Pyros exist. It feels like I give up.

535
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,719
Bye. Behind.

536
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,300
Well, he just fucked everybody up.

537
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,699
I made the call out to and they didn't hear you.

538
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,559
Oh, I'm in trouble.

539
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:51,280
I'm I'm getting ready to use the schwicky swag.

540
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,380
I'm not doing bad.

541
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,699
I mean, I got 53 points.

542
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:59,179
That's like doing pretty good.

543
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:03,039
All right, let's do engineer engineer with the mini century.

544
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,579
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's go.

545
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:11,269
OK, I want to do this.

546
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:14,059
Get a teleport. Yep.

547
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:17,579
Teleport. Teleport going up.

548
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:19,619
Do not get backstabbed.

549
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:25,059
What if I want to?

550
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:30,119
Well, well, well, help.

551
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,599
I'm on fire. I need a dispenser.

552
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,280
Help. Help.

553
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,440
What a dispenser.

554
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:43,449
Get out of the dispenser. Get out of the way.

555
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,369
Wait, was it you?

556
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:46,449
Oh, I think I was being OK.

557
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:49,400
I was a sniper asking for help.

558
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,440
Help level this dispenser up.

559
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:57,079
I only have 55 mana.

560
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,929
Where's the ammo on this map?

561
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,969
This guy thinks he's playing World of Warcraft.

562
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,309
Look at this. We have like a little nest over here.

563
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:21,820
Perfect. Lay down the rug.

564
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,980
Always help. Always help your fellow engineer.

565
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,179
Everyone's just going to be over there helping you.

566
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,300
There is no one else playing the game right now.

567
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:36,139
Oh, my God.

568
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,139
Oh, I got two kills with this thing.

569
00:41:37,139 --> 00:41:38,820
Holy shit. That means I get crits with it.

570
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,420
The only thing I care about when playing as engineer is the frontier justice.

571
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:47,739
Oh, oh, oh, that's why it's fun.

572
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:48,900
It's probably going to try to tell somebody.

573
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,000
I killed them, killed them.

574
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,900
But you got one of the teleporters.

575
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,099
All right. Now this is where I go and fuck somebody up.

576
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:19,099
All right. I'm happy with it.

577
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:25,019
I'm happy with it. Is this all the way it is all the way?

578
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:32,380
All right. We're all good.

579
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,659
No one's going to be fucking around over here.

580
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:38,420
Are you sure about that?

581
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,659
I don't know. Oh, bye.

582
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:44,179
He's at the spawn.

583
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:45,619
My own shit got in the way.

584
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:47,809
God damn it.

585
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,170
Yeah, it's going to be hard keeping that up.

586
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,710
He's dedicated to his craft.

587
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,070
All right. All right. That's fine.

588
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,659
Let's go, bud.

589
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:05,239
Got him.

590
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,619
Was that you?

591
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:13,889
What? The velociraptor in the call.

592
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:19,349
Oh, spy spy's coming for you next.

593
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,380
Spy's coming for next.

594
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,369
Back at spawn.

595
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,329
Now, the dispensers, did they all get destroyed?

596
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:32,789
My dispensers there.

597
00:43:32,789 --> 00:43:36,239
I'm trying to get the teleporter back up.

598
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,360
Somebody is at the dispenser right now.

599
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:42,460
Let me tell a frag him.

600
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:49,900
We're trying. Oh, fuck.

601
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:57,610
This is bad.

602
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,250
We're going to get this thing a little free.

603
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,650
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quickly, quickly, quickly.

604
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:09,539
But I'm just trying to have a decoy.

605
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:10,579
Yeah, good, good.

606
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:14,070
Exactly what I wanted.

607
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,030
Exactly what I wanted.

608
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,550
They killed the mini sentry like three times.

609
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,739
They didn't even go for the big one.

610
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,760
Those fools.

611
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,599
Change your hit sound.

612
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,889
My hit sound is like a squishy sound.

613
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:35,469
Change it. Change your hit sound.

614
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:37,150
Change your view model.

615
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,030
Change your sentry to me.

616
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,630
Change your loadout. Equip the pen.

617
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:44,829
Jerma, equip the pen.

618
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,949
Oh, did you say pan?

619
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:47,869
Equip the pen.

620
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:50,269
You talk about the pan like the pen.

621
00:44:50,269 --> 00:44:53,349
Why do you keep saying pen?

622
00:44:53,349 --> 00:45:01,010
Equip the pen.

623
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:14,300
I like to be annoying with the pistol.

624
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,500
Equip the pen.

625
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,369
Oh, shit. Sorry, he's going to die.

626
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,690
What is the why do you keep saying that?

627
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,889
What is that? What's the pen?

628
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:28,460
Um, that's it.

629
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,440
There's really not much more to it.

630
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,610
Come on, we can do it.

631
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,900
Over time.

632
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,760
All right, get in there. Get in there.

633
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Get in there.

634
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,079
This last point is really hard because there's always a million sentries

635
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:49,429
at a perfect angle.

636
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:50,710
Wait, no.

637
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,710
We're just losers. Losers.

638
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,469
That's why he has 83 points and he's playing with a track pad.

639
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,699
He's lying.

640
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:58,699
You sure?

641
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:00,579
Yeah, I'm sure. Where do you want to go?

642
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:01,980
This is where you leave.

643
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,340
This is where you leave.

644
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:05,780
Yeah, this is where you 100 percent leave the game.

645
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,739
OK, because nobody is going to stay.

646
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:10,019
And I told you this and we discussed this.

647
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,429
OK, do you want the new maps now?

648
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:14,230
I'll put some of the. Sure.

649
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:22,380
The good or new maps on.

650
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,889
Let me look at Medic.

651
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:27,780
They add, OK, the Vaccinator.

652
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,940
This one was weird at the very get go.

653
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,849
I wonder if they changed it.

654
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:33,969
I don't think so.

655
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:37,050
And it is still weird.

656
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,480
A crazy Uber charge rate.

657
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,860
You press your reload key to cycle through resist types

658
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,780
while healing provides you and your target with a constant 10 percent

659
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,300
resistance to the selected damage type.

660
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,019
The Uber charge provides a two and a half second resistance bubble

661
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,539
that blocks 75 percent base damage and 100 percent crit damage.

662
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,900
It's like we're playing D4.

663
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,530
It's a Diablo four item.

664
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,010
And what does this say? I just picked up a sign.

665
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,769
And what does it do?

666
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:10,530
OK, minus 66 percent overheal, whatever.

667
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,159
You have to switch it between things.

668
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,360
So it requires more buttons.

669
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,719
So like when when a pyro is coming, you have to switch it to fire resistance.

670
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,889
I wonder, was that any better than the quick fix?

671
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:35,690
Um, situationally, maybe to like anti crits.

672
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,769
If you know somebody has a crits creed.

673
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:37,969
But why wouldn't you just use the Uber?

674
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,369
I guess it's faster.

675
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:41,650
Crit would probably kill someone with a vaccinator.

676
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:44,320
No, it's 100 percent.

677
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,559
When you Uber, you block 100 percent crit damage of the selected type.

678
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,510
That might be new, then it may be new.

679
00:47:57,579 --> 00:47:59,659
Vaccinator is OP if you get good with it.

680
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,579
It is very strong.

681
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,019
Like if a pyro is walking in and you switch to fire damage,

682
00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:08,380
it they'll they just start doing like one every hit.

683
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,300
You just outheal any damage they can do.

684
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,219
Well, I missed the entire Uber build period, so that's bad.

685
00:48:17,639 --> 00:48:19,000
My phone needs it.

686
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,519
Oh, this is nice. This map school.

687
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:23,329
Oh, I like this a lot.

688
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:28,460
It's like water spike.

689
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,260
God damn it, I taste a spike.

690
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,940
It's great to hear you having the takes that I also had a week ago

691
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:38,420
and how how quickly they've changed.

692
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:43,539
Really? So you don't like this map is cursed.

693
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,260
This map is not one that you want to play on, even though you had the same.

694
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,260
I do want to play on it.

695
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,940
I want you to experience it.

696
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,099
Everything bad that could possibly happen to you is going to happen

697
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,730
because like this map is haunted.

698
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,670
What? There's ghosts on this map.

699
00:49:00,949 --> 00:49:03,309
Wait, there are you mean that?

700
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:06,349
Or is it like you just like around like in the program ghost?

701
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:08,230
Not like, oh, I'm going to see a cute little girl.

702
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,030
No, like in the program, someone died on this map while making it.

703
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,389
And there's ghosts on this map and it's haunted.

704
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,920
Wait, what?

705
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,639
You'll see by the end of this map.

706
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:21,460
You're going to like, no, I get what he meant.

707
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,780
I don't I don't. I have no idea what that means.

708
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,619
But are you going to like a haunted house and like all the spooky stuff

709
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:29,619
starts happening and things start going badly for you by demo?

710
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,449
That's Venice. Venice is haunted.

711
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:41,519
Oh, OK. That's by two. Who knows what somebody in the chat

712
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,440
just write their type in all caps.

713
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,119
Get your fucking beam on that heavy.

714
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,369
Oh, that was bad.

715
00:49:50,369 --> 00:49:55,030
That was a bad crack, but it's OK.

716
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,429
You know, don't say swears.

717
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,590
We don't have very many hourglass, do we?

718
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,590
There's one demo.

719
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,750
I've seen a lot of spies, a lot of snipers.

720
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,820
What do you want us to?

721
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,980
Oh, no, no, no.

722
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,780
Oh, I don't.

723
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,820
This is three pyros, two scouts.

724
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,900
Are things not going well right now?

725
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,260
Is that what you're suggesting?

726
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,219
Not necessarily.

727
00:50:32,219 --> 00:50:33,380
Yeah, I use cow mangler.

728
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,809
There it is. The conk.

729
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:41,059
The what? The conqueror.

730
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:42,460
I don't even know how to fucking be a good teammate.

731
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:48,530
I'll show you.

732
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:56,239
Especially to the engineers with the holding shit.

733
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:01,530
I don't know where we're going into the haunted mansion.

734
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,789
Am I going away from the.

735
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:09,320
Wait, there's usually arrows on the team fortress.

736
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,199
Wrong way. Wrong way. What's he doing?

738
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,800
What's he doing? Get that fucking beam on that heavy.

739
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:26,579
It's a big map.

740
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,179
Who thought spy was a good idea?

741
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:29,860
This map haunted.

742
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,050
No, this map is haunted.

743
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:39,780
Are you just not very good?

744
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,000
Do you think ghosts are real?

745
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,900
That's a whole can of worms.

746
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Answer them.

747
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,099
Um, I mean, not necessarily.

748
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,940
I think there's a possibility there could be some phantoms.

749
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,099
I feel like that was a yes or no question,

750
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:55,820
and you cannot answer it with not necessarily.

751
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:02,360
Oh, my God. Oh, how did I miss everybody?

752
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,659
Did it hit the wall?

753
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,219
There it is. What?

754
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:10,260
Dude, I got the conqueror.

755
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,300
I got the conqueror. I got the conqueror.

756
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,050
I got the conqueror. You got the what?

757
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,610
I have to stop doing that.

758
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,849
It's not even funny.

759
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:19,010
All right, let's go. Where are you?

760
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,809
I thought I knew that was a spy, too.

761
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:24,929
You just stop muting and centering my words.

762
00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,670
You're about to put your lips on it.

763
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,829
He's fucking with me and messing up my video game.

764
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,050
Was I messing with you? They're ghost real.

765
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:44,010
They might. I don't know.

766
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,530
How am I supposed to know?

767
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,730
Because like once you reach a certain level of status in society,

768
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:53,090
don't you like get invited to these events where like the president's there

769
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,409
and he's like, oh, he's like, tells you all this shit about ghosts.

770
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,369
Or you're in a party and there's like all actors

771
00:52:57,369 --> 00:52:59,809
and they all like have the same.

772
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,730
What do they call it? What do they call it?

773
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:06,809
Sir, it's been nine days since I've left my home.

774
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,429
What are you talking about?

775
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,070
Again, I think I'm going to get invited to like fucking special events.

776
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,789
Are you is that what you're implying?

777
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:15,510
Well, you went to like the streamer awards.

778
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,690
There wasn't like an Illuminati there.

779
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:24,039
Yeah, we talk about aliens and ghosts and shit.

780
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, yeah, I'm expecting to get 10K more subs this week.

781
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,800
Yeah, because my yeah, I found a good ghost.

782
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,320
I got a poltergeist. We were doing an exercise.

783
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,039
You didn't hear any conversation like that.

784
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:34,119
Hold on. This is important.

785
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,880
I got I got to get a cow mangler here.

786
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,840
I have an opportunity to help the fucking team.

787
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,039
OK, what was your question?

788
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,400
Do all the do all the streamers talk about like ghosts

789
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,559
and conspiracies and stuff?

790
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:45,960
Is that what you said?

791
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,159
I want to know that you're not necessarily.

792
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,679
And you said it's a whole can of worms.

793
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:52,760
And now your ghost answer is I don't know.

794
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,039
Well, because we evolved from I was interested to what you had to say to

795
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:01,320
you lost me because that's a very loaded question.

796
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,719
That that's like an hour and a half long conversation.

797
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,760
Do you not want to have it?

798
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,519
You're going to not play this game that long.

799
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:10,400
I'm currently enjoying Team Fortress.

800
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,800
And ever since we started talking about this,

801
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,280
but my skill level has dropped by like at least 30 percent.

802
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:17,960
Do you want to know why your skill level drop?

803
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,719
No, no, no, no, no.

804
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:21,119
I was doing fine until we started talking about fucking aliens and ghosts.

805
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,880
Until we came to Venice.

806
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:35,920
TLDR. What?

807
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,320
It missed him. You got to be shitting me.

808
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,960
Oh, my God. How does it matter that miss?

809
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:44,800
That thing has a gigantic explosion radius.

810
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,039
OK, I got to step it up here. I'm not doing very well.

811
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,929
And to play the worst possible thing I could play

812
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:01,090
and play spy with the Spicycle and the

813
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,050
is the load out here.

814
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:08,690
I forget how you play spy the default revolver because the ambassador was

815
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,010
nerfed and the enforcer was nerfed.

816
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,210
And like every spy equipment has been nerfed.

817
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:22,659
The dead bringers been nerfed.

818
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:29,449
Oh, my. I had the Spicycle. That was a mistake.

819
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:35,719
Yeah, it should not.

820
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:39,659
That should not have happened.

821
00:55:39,659 --> 00:55:41,139
Why do you think it happened?

822
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:43,219
I don't know, but there's a fucking scout over here.

823
00:55:43,219 --> 00:55:45,650
I need help. Blue Team, help me.

824
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,019
He's getting me help.

825
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:53,989
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

826
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:56,789
What happened? Oh, he's using the crossbow.

827
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:00,659
I thought he was I thought he was stream sniping.

828
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:02,260
He's using the

829
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:12,079
I was calling for medic as a spy and this guy

830
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,440
he kills me with the crossbow.

831
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,500
OK, kind of spooky.

832
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:36,449
That was fucking funny.

833
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:41,440
Medic, medic, medic.

834
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,900
I'm not I'm a real person.

835
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:51,650
Oh, what's that thing?

836
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,250
That was cool.

837
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,489
Did you did you know they made the Liberty launcher

838
00:56:54,489 --> 00:56:56,860
the best weapon in the whole game?

839
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,119
What do you mean?

840
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,400
That's just flat out.

841
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,920
They they buffed the Liberty launcher.

842
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,980
It's the best weapon in the whole game now.

843
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,900
What was different before?

844
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,820
Is it the blast damage?

845
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,980
It's had like three different changes.

846
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,300
They removed a lot of the downsides.

847
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,980
I mean, 25% penalty is actually pretty bad considering.

848
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:18,139
And it's really not because you get an extra rocket and extra projectile speed

849
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:22,079
that makes up for the consistency on the why don't I just use the stupid thing

850
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,019
damage the what thing the the sneeze gun?

851
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,730
I don't know. Do it.

852
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,380
OK, you can only hold three.

853
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,329
No matter what you do, it's not going to go well.

854
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:38,210
And that's not I'm not being mean.

855
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,369
That went pretty well.

856
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:54,179
It's just Venice.

857
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,059
I'm out of ammo already.

858
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,059
Oh, you hold them.

859
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,340
That is actually scared the shit out of me.

860
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:05,500
I thought something happened.

861
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,139
I need ammo with ammo on this map like everywhere.

862
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,619
I better not fucking die.

863
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:15,210
I swear to God.

864
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,579
Oh, there we go.

865
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,340
I, I almost got the conch and then we can really go for it.

866
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:32,440
But what that item that's on soldier, the Liberty Lauchers.

867
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,159
Let's go.

868
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:41,340
Well, let's get them.

869
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:45,099
Oh, it's all right.

870
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:47,460
I think you would have killed him if you had the Liberty launcher.

871
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,860
I don't think so.

872
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,210
Oh, you had an extra rocket?

873
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,139
This just makes sense.

874
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:59,909
And you would miss less because it goes faster.

875
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:04,380
I'm using this fucking weird thing.

876
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,380
Those of you that don't know, Team Fortress Classic is also one of my favorite games of all time.

877
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,710
And I use this weapon all the time.

878
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,190
Classic is you have to hold the button down and then release it to shoot.

879
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,150
A lot of people say trash item.

880
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:17,889
Fucking terrible.

881
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:19,889
Just wait till you see somebody that knows what they're doing with it,

882
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,889
and then you can fucking go talk about it.

883
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:30,369
It's the trash item.

884
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,510
I was scrolling through my old TF2 videos the other day,

885
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:35,949
and even my description of the video I made about the classic was like,

886
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:37,469
why would you do this?

887
00:59:37,469 --> 00:59:39,670
Just get the ambassador and be invisible with it.

888
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,119
We'll see.

889
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:45,880
We will see.

890
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,579
It doesn't make people pop when you kill them.

891
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:48,380
That's neat.

892
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:56,840
It is pretty neat.

893
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:05,070
Oh, fuck.

894
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:07,050
He's terrible.

895
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,849
A scout versus a sniper is an automatic loss for the sniper.

896
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:13,349
Don't you kidding me?

897
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:14,650
You're digging yourself in deeper.

898
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:19,159
Are you kidding me?

899
01:00:19,159 --> 01:00:21,099
Guys, he's not bad.

900
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:31,159
Venice is haunted.

901
01:00:31,159 --> 01:00:32,800
Where are they? Where do they even come from?

902
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,599
Where's the enemies?

903
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,969
Where's their like spawn in the shadow realm?

904
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:53,030
Don't think about it.

905
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,940
My sensitivity is too high.

906
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,199
I got to drop it by like at least 10 percent.

907
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah, way, way, way too high, way too high.

908
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,840
Like outrageously high.

909
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:10,340
What is it at right now?

910
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,900
No, I don't want it at zero.

911
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,800
One point five.

912
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,800
That's better. OK.

913
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,300
Oh, you got to be ready for the pub push.

914
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,389
You got to be ready for the pub push, Jerma.

915
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:29,170
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 12 seconds, 11 seconds, two seconds.

916
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:36,219
You got to be ready, Jerma.

917
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:38,019
I haven't played this game in 10 years, dude.

918
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,039
You weren't ready for the pub push.

919
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,159
Come on.

920
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:50,800
I just I was I'm just trying to figure out how to play the goddamn game again.

921
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:59,059
Oh, and are we leaving again?

922
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:01,309
Unless you want to play Venice again.

923
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:02,969
I didn't find that map particularly terrible.

924
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,150
It's just kind of big and too many places to go.

925
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,699
Well, next time you're like, well, hey, Venice isn't haunted.

926
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:14,389
Remember, you've never won a game on it yet.

927
01:02:14,389 --> 01:02:17,380
We played it in one time.

928
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,219
What a coincidence.

929
01:02:19,219 --> 01:02:20,579
Played it one time, lost one time.

930
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,179
What a coincidence.

931
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,829
I'm going to play with the bazookas beggar backwards.

932
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:33,469
The bazookas beggar.

933
01:02:33,469 --> 01:02:38,840
I it's been 10 years.

934
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:44,820
Actually, it's been seven.

935
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,579
Are you still going to play viewfinder?

936
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:50,340
I don't know. Maybe I'm bad.

937
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,610
This is great. It's been a while since I've jumped in and played and cared.

938
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,000
Open some crates.

939
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,309
I could open a few crates, maybe.

940
01:03:05,309 --> 01:03:10,159
Maybe we'll save the crate stuff for another day.

941
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,780
Huh? Because I want to play.

942
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,050
But you already got the keys.

943
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,730
Jerma, I don't want the quates opening.

944
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:23,619
They don't disappear.

945
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:27,150
Well, more team fortress.

946
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,389
Maybe. Yeah, there's another new map.

947
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,929
It's shark Bay. Don't go in the water.

948
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:33,190
There's sharks in the water.

949
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:37,550
Sharks in the water.

950
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,250
Always vote. Yes, always vote.

951
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,949
Yes, always. OK.

952
01:03:40,949 --> 01:03:45,380
Don't even look. Don't even look.

953
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,179
OK. Oh, this is a off map.

954
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:03,829
Where is everybody?

955
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:06,489
Yes, again, I guess.

956
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,389
I mean, I don't know.

957
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,289
Wait, what?

958
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:11,289
Now I'm feeling like there's a little bit of a mix up.

959
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,030
Is it mix up?

960
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:15,719
There may be. I still put it.

961
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:19,489
Yes, anyway. He's gone. OK.

962
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:23,539
Where is the other team?

963
01:04:23,539 --> 01:04:27,039
I don't know. Should we try again?

964
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,039
Yeah, you vote. Yes.

965
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:33,239
No, I mean, like, should we requeue?

966
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:34,900
I don't see anybody on Red Team.

967
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,239
There's like three people over there.

968
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,619
They're coming.

969
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,039
OK, I'm going to stay at this point.

970
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,539
Stop voting. Yes, I think.

971
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,019
I think we're being trolled.

972
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:53,210
OK. But maybe one more. OK.

973
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,650
Oh, where's the other team?

974
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,409
They're capping the point, Mr.

975
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:07,360
I got it. Have you ever seen a ghost?

976
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:20,800
Now you have. Nice one.

977
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,039
You've got to be fucking kidding me, dude.

978
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,239
I hit the guy twice and I get randomly dead in one hit.

979
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:31,739
You've still got some Venice on you.

980
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:43,510
Hasn't worn off yet.

981
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:52,579
It's very laggy, but I'm all right.

982
01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:56,639
Are they on it? They're dead.

983
01:05:57,739 --> 01:06:02,639
Now they're ghosts.

984
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:05,500
Come on. How much does it take?

985
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:10,659
I hit him like five times.

986
01:06:10,659 --> 01:06:13,860
Oh, this isn't your grandfather's FPS game.

987
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:23,019
Oh, that's right. We get a little raunchy in here.

988
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:32,699
I got about the islander saying it is literally.

989
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,860
It actually is. Whoa.

990
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:40,300
Tracking my day.

991
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,800
I mean, you have to have skill in an FPS game.

992
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:54,949
Kill this motherfucker before he can build a set for it.

993
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:56,590
There's so many people in there.

994
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,489
All right. I got to I got to like stick with something

995
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:00,630
and stop switching every five seconds.

996
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:04,269
Equip the pen. Now we're going back to soldier.

997
01:07:09,869 --> 01:07:13,409
I'm not allowed to get off of soldier for the next 15 straight minutes

998
01:07:13,409 --> 01:07:15,789
no matter what. Oh, it's not happening.

999
01:07:35,769 --> 01:07:38,250
You've got Liberty Launcher is incredible.

1000
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,949
Whoever buffed this weapon out of their mind.

1001
01:07:49,489 --> 01:08:00,380
Oh, that fuck.

1002
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:07,050
What am I voting? What am I voting?

1003
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,730
That's a no for me. I know you.

1004
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:16,020
OK. We're we can win it.

1005
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,960
You know what I miss?

1006
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,539
What's that?

1007
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,340
The ghastly gibbous.

1008
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,079
It's a great hat.

1009
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,939
Yeah, you're not seeing too many of them these days.

1010
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:59,380
See some ironic gibbouses.

1011
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,699
This weapon is awful.

1012
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:09,079
I'm going to play a different weapon.

1013
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,720
I forgot it was inaccurate.

1014
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,460
I forgot it like shoots it like there's a deviation of like

1015
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:24,760
20 or 30 degrees every time you shoot.

1016
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:27,979
There's what? Three minutes before I left me.

1017
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,510
What is wrong with me?

1018
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,390
Do I stink? Maybe.

1019
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,149
Oh, no, because they're all healing.

1020
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:38,250
What the fuck? Never mind.

1021
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:41,970
I get it now. He'll stir.

1022
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:45,739
He's playing. You had three.

1023
01:09:49,079 --> 01:09:51,319
Did I actually have three medics?

1024
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:55,119
Yeah. And seriously, I was running around with like 20 HP like, hey,

1025
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,729
don't say no to that. That's me.

1026
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,750
I think we leave and we leave.

1027
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:05,189
I think I think this is a three medic type of type of situation.

1028
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:13,000
All right. I'm up.

1029
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,399
I think this is a vote kick random people until we get three medics on Jerma.

1030
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:24,020
No, I don't think so.

1031
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,199
All right. Don't believe in ghosts.

1032
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:29,039
Don't believe in like any conspiracy theories.

1033
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:32,300
Apparently you believe in Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster.

1034
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,989
Yeah. The Jersey.

1035
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:40,979
No. Wait, what do you mean?

1036
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:42,779
It's the same game. It's the same.

1037
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:45,560
Oh, shit. It's like this game just crashed.

1038
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:56,130
OK, I think we joined and left too quickly.

1039
01:10:56,130 --> 01:10:58,590
It says you're currently offline.

1040
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:02,029
OK, well, we may have I may have broken some stuff.

1041
01:11:02,069 --> 01:11:02,729
I think you broke it.

1042
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:06,430
It's not letting me start searching, but it does say a member of your party is offline.

1043
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,369
OK, well, maybe restart TF2.

1044
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,899
All right. It's not Tuesday maintenance.

1045
01:11:13,899 --> 01:11:16,229
It's literally Sunday.

1046
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:20,020
OK, I'm going to restart TF2 and we'll go from there.

1047
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:24,149
Are you relaunching?

1048
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:26,289
I'm relaunching.

1049
01:11:27,539 --> 01:11:29,739
Give it a second. It has to do that weird thing again.

1050
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:36,979
You broke it.

1051
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:39,939
You broke it.

1052
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:42,300
The government broke it when I brought up Bigfoot.

1053
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:46,090
I mean, Bigfoot makes sense to me because this I mean,

1054
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:49,529
there's a very real possibility that there's just like a huge gorilla just somewhere

1055
01:11:49,529 --> 01:11:54,260
and it's just way bigger than everybody else.

1056
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,079
They're called gorillas.

1057
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:00,359
Yeah, but but like a Bigfoot could potentially just be a huge gorilla

1058
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:01,899
that people just oh, my God, it's Bigfoot.

1059
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:07,039
No, dude, that's just a giant gorilla.

1060
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:09,539
OK, are we still in a party?

1061
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:12,319
Yeah. OK, should we try it again?

1062
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:21,420
Yeah, I'm doing it. OK, go for it.

1063
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,479
There we go. OK.

1064
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:29,359
In the U.S. in the wild, do you think a giant gorilla is walking around?

1065
01:12:31,939 --> 01:12:50,939
I mean, I don't know. Possible.

1066
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:54,399
It's just a furry.

1067
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:56,090
I would buy that.

1068
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:58,090
Yeah, I would just use like for the OK.

1069
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,050
You want a weird story?

1070
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:04,189
I don't think I've ever talked about this with you that you saw Bigfoot one time.

1071
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,369
Well, yeah, but also, OK.

1072
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:11,119
When I was a little kid,

1073
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:15,600
we're talking like a real little like it may have been preschool age. OK.

1074
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:21,819
I got a Spider-Man costume on Halloween and I loved it.

1075
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,119
So we got to leave. OK.

1076
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:30,880
OK, the hardest part, you got to find matches.

1077
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,579
OK, so when I was a little kid in preschool, I had a Spider-Man costume

1078
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,880
for Halloween and I loved it.

1079
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,920
And I just thought it was cool to like be Spider-Man.

1080
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,359
So I'd just wear it on days that weren't Halloween.

1081
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,920
And I'd like go out back and like play around in my Spider-Man outfit.

1082
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:46,819
And I would never wear clothes under it

1083
01:13:46,819 --> 01:13:49,119
because I wanted to authentically be Spider-Man.

1084
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,329
What my brother hated it.

1085
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:53,470
My brother hated it because he's I have an older brother.

1086
01:13:53,789 --> 01:13:56,329
And me and my mom would go pick up my brother from school

1087
01:13:56,329 --> 01:13:59,970
and I would wear the Spider-Man outfit to greet him

1088
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:02,270
when he's like coming out of school and like all his friends.

1089
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,130
He like little Spider-Man running up to us like, that's so not cool.

1090
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:09,550
And I think my mom would bring me along just because like she knew he hated it.

1091
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:16,359
So you so you were like a you would you would like a practical joke.

1092
01:14:16,989 --> 01:14:19,189
Yeah. So my dad says, where is this going?

1093
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:23,670
Bigfoot is totally just someone like testing out their first 100 percent.

1094
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,489
I can relate to that.

1095
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:30,189
All right. Are we are we going for it here?

1096
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:32,729
Because like this is this is it.

1097
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:33,829
This is the one I've got.

1098
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:34,949
I've got my shit going here.

1099
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,149
And now I'm going full on.

1100
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:37,289
No, I'm going engineer.

1101
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:38,789
This is my map on engineer.

1102
01:14:38,789 --> 01:14:40,569
Now I'll play good here. Check this out.

1103
01:14:40,569 --> 01:14:43,420
Top 15 minutes on soldier.

1104
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,710
It doesn't count.

1105
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:46,689
Yeah, it is a new map.

1106
01:14:46,689 --> 01:14:51,170
Hey, who cares about what wrench I'm using?

1107
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,430
I just got to equip one.

1108
01:14:53,430 --> 01:15:05,789
Come on. How did you do that?

1109
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:07,430
My mom says I can confirm.

1110
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,770
So I guess that is why she brought me.

1111
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,270
I don't know if she's saying I can confirm that's why she brought me

1112
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:16,850
or I can confirm Bigfoot is just a guy testing a fursuit.

1113
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:22,840
She may know more.

1114
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,970
It's been a while.

1115
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:37,079
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.

1116
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:38,180
I got to go. I got to go. I got to go.

1117
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:39,899
I got to go now. I got to go. I got to go. I got to go now.

1118
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:41,640
I got to go. I got to go. I got to go. I'll be back.

1119
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,579
Where's our sentry?

1120
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,579
Fuck. Hold on. I just been a long time.

1121
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:45,979
The gates opening.

1122
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:48,180
It's been a long time. Hold on.

1123
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:49,939
I didn't have the right equipment.

1124
01:15:49,939 --> 01:15:53,180
Just wait. It's been like it's been 10 years.

1125
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:56,039
Where are you putting it? I'm going up here.

1126
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:00,140
I hope it gets the build.

1127
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:01,500
I'm keeping an eye on you.

1128
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:09,319
Keep an eye on me, please. It's been 10 years.

1129
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:12,199
All right. And that Pyro would not been able to be there.

1130
01:16:12,199 --> 01:16:14,199
Spy spy. Good. I just. Good. Good. I'm good. Good.

1131
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:19,439
I wanted to die, so I come on, get the sentry.

1132
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:21,939
Everything's fine. Protect my shit for a minute.

1133
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:23,819
It's what shit?

1134
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:26,300
There's a spy. There's a spy. There's a spy back there.

1135
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,500
And he's eyeing my fucking cool building.

1136
01:16:30,859 --> 01:16:32,970
Your medic defended it.

1137
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:35,939
Let's go.

1138
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,539
All right. Now I'm good.

1139
01:16:37,539 --> 01:16:44,880
That's a spy right there. No doubt.

1140
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,640
We're good. I got you.

1141
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,659
It's me.

1142
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:53,210
All right. Let's go check it out.

1143
01:16:53,210 --> 01:17:00,590
It's a cool weapon skin.

1144
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,829
I don't know why I do that.

1145
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:06,039
I'm just such a weirdo. I can't help it.

1146
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:12,100
He's a freak.

1147
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:20,050
Get that Pyro. Don't let him out of here.

1148
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,560
I don't know why the fuck I do that.

1149
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,060
Spies around here. Watch out.

1150
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,300
Keep your eyes peeled.

1151
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:32,159
Oh, nice pick up. Nice pick up.

1152
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:37,060
See, you don't think I know what the fuck I'm doing.

1153
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,119
Got the Wrangler?

1154
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,579
No.

1155
01:17:40,579 --> 01:17:42,020
I bet you really know.

1156
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:43,659
I mean, I don't like the Wrangler.

1157
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,960
I don't like how it turns your sentry off for like three seconds.

1158
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,300
You know, they they completely changed the short circuit as well.

1159
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,359
Are they really?

1160
01:17:50,359 --> 01:17:53,159
Yeah. It's really weird now.

1161
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,260
It shoots like a spear.

1162
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:03,859
That's kind of cool.

1163
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:07,479
I'll short circuit.

1164
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:12,050
I'm doing fine. I'm good.

1165
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,250
OK, so do you understand that you're doing fine because people are helping you?

1166
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:17,329
Are you denying my help?

1167
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:20,590
Engineer is the class that is incredible.

1168
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:25,189
Soldiers above you.

1169
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:31,930
Engineer is insanely important, but it requires teamwork for it.

1170
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,890
He had the crits. He had crits.

1171
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:37,649
All my stuff is still there besides Sentry. It's fine.

1172
01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:38,930
I just didn't whack my sentry.

1173
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:42,270
Whack my helicopter once.

1174
01:18:42,270 --> 01:18:48,680
OK, oh, and there goes everything else.

1175
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,579
I got your dispenser saved if that matters.

1176
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:56,109
Um, it might.

1177
01:18:56,109 --> 01:19:01,970
It actually might be a huge deal.

1178
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:08,770
My accolades.

1179
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:12,609
I'm all right. I'm moving. I'm moving my shit.

1180
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:16,199
Are we good? Are they on it or should I?

1181
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:17,199
No, you're good.

1182
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:25,300
I think we're still all right.

1183
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,600
We're holding.

1184
01:19:26,619 --> 01:19:43,529
Yeah, we are. They're moving it.

1185
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,510
They're moving it. Oh, shit.

1186
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:54,960
But long, I freaked out and I grabbed my dispenser and died.

1187
01:19:56,829 --> 01:19:58,569
Hey, I'm doing fine, though.

1188
01:19:58,569 --> 01:20:00,779
You're doing great.

1189
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:02,079
Turn off motion blur.

1190
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:04,520
Is it on? Probably.

1191
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,729
Does default on.

1192
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:08,670
Well, that fucking was loud.

1193
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:24,590
Uh, no.

1194
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:30,770
Hey, nice. Easy.

1195
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,810
The sentry being up at the time that it did in the zoning that it provided,

1196
01:20:34,829 --> 01:20:37,829
I believe I should get at least five friend points for that.

1197
01:20:38,329 --> 01:20:40,430
You should wait. You should have points.

1198
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:44,270
You should also get five friend points because you protected my nest

1199
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:45,970
when I was out there.

1200
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,710
Where are we on friend points right now?

1201
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:49,609
Am I above you?

1202
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:53,079
Uh, you have 11. I have nine.

1203
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:55,319
So I have. Yeah, we're pretty close in points.

1204
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:59,789
Wait, those those points are friend points. Yeah.

1205
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,600
All right. I'm going to go back to

1206
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,020
I thought I had a strange gunslinger a long time ago.

1207
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,079
Maybe not. So you said that.

1208
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:12,819
Let me see the short circuit.

1209
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:15,300
Fire has launched a projectile consuming energy ball.

1210
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,260
Sixty five metal. That's a lot.

1211
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:26,189
Yeah. Short circuit was kind of insanely good.

1212
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:30,079
Was it? Yeah.

1213
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:33,380
So you have to destroy projectiles with the ball and you can't just do it forever.

1214
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,279
I'm not sure.

1215
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,880
Did you begin weird ever since you got bitten by that bird?

1216
01:21:39,939 --> 01:21:43,979
What? When did I get hit by a bird?

1217
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,760
You didn't get bit by a bird is what you're saying.

1218
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:55,069
Are you denying it?

1219
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:58,510
No, I just seriously going to go live right now in front of all these people and deny it.

1220
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:04,489
Does that mean I'm being like chased by a bird and pecked in the head or something?

1221
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:07,100
Like, how do you get bit by a bird?

1222
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,970
I have a bird story.

1223
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:12,970
My mom's here. I have I have the mom bird story.

1224
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:14,829
Follow up. You get a lot of bird.

1225
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:19,479
You get a lot of stories, don't you?

1226
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:24,010
You could say that there's my birthday and there was a bird flying around.

1227
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:24,770
It was being really weird.

1228
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:25,409
It was going crazy.

1229
01:22:25,409 --> 01:22:27,149
It was coming for my birthday cake or something.

1230
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:30,210
And my mom smashed it with a bag full of eaten corn husks

1231
01:22:30,210 --> 01:22:33,579
and smashed it down on the ground.

1232
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:36,300
What? She defended me from the bird.

1233
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,000
It was going it was insane.

1234
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,800
Like, have you seen the movie The Birds?

1235
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,000
It was like that bird.

1236
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,500
So wait, so you didn't have friends.

1237
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,100
You were being attacked by a bird.

1238
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:49,880
Yeah. What the fuck?

1239
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:58,020
Yeah, it was a bird dynamic, but real.

1240
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:03,590
All right. Now that we're out, I can do this.

1241
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,789
No, we're not. There's a there's a soldier back here.

1242
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,899
What the fuck is happening with this?

1243
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:15,140
People just back here behind the cart.

1244
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:22,770
They must have a teleporter or something weird.

1245
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,369
Unfortunate.

1246
01:23:26,369 --> 01:23:29,399
Is there they have to have a teleporter, right?

1247
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:41,449
I didn't see one. I was jumping around all over the place.

1248
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:49,920
Hey, somebody's killed that guy.

1249
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,640
Oh, no. OK, he's all right.

1250
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,079
I'm bringing this all the way up.

1251
01:23:57,079 --> 01:24:02,329
Make sure I don't get killed by anybody.

1252
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:12,220
All right. So far, so good.

1253
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:21,250
All right. Get on it.

1254
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,649
Why? How come every time you die, you don't scream

1255
01:24:23,649 --> 01:24:27,060
as though you died in real life?

1256
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,760
Because it's childish.

1257
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,439
OK, see you in the next circus stream.

1258
01:24:40,899 --> 01:24:47,409
You've grown adult clown.

1259
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:50,409
So what? Clowns just don't should not exist anymore.

1260
01:24:50,409 --> 01:24:51,989
They should never be a clown.

1261
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:55,289
The only way clowns should exist if you're adult is if you're into the clown.

1262
01:24:56,859 --> 01:25:00,159
But so so you're saying that that we should not have clowns

1263
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:02,359
should not exist anymore.

1264
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:03,560
They should never be another clown.

1265
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,460
That is not what I just said.

1266
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,159
But an adult clown.

1267
01:25:09,159 --> 01:25:11,460
Who is it? Who is a clown that's not an adult?

1268
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:14,350
What are you talking about?

1269
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,149
Oh, fuck. I just blew up.

1270
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:18,449
But who enjoys clowns?

1271
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:21,829
Adults are clowns, but who enjoys clowns?

1272
01:25:21,829 --> 01:25:25,229
So what? So your opinion on entertainment is if we should just delete

1273
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:27,829
everything, that's not your opinion of entertainment.

1274
01:25:27,829 --> 01:25:29,229
Is that what you're saying?

1275
01:25:29,229 --> 01:25:33,869
Tell me your opinion on D4.

1276
01:25:33,869 --> 01:25:36,909
It's not good. It's not good at all.

1277
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:37,909
It's not good at all.

1278
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:39,970
Oh, yeah, because you have the crowd now.

1279
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:41,529
It like isn't even a thing anymore.

1280
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:43,970
Like every day set on their own live stream.

1281
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,369
That's just not fun.

1282
01:25:45,369 --> 01:25:47,510
Our bullet point is that's not true.

1283
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,250
The game fun. I even bring it up.

1284
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:51,550
They skip the bullet point because no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1285
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:53,810
Hold on. Rewind. Back it up.

1286
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:55,649
Take 10 steps backwards.

1287
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:57,649
Yeah. Who was three months ago?

1288
01:25:57,649 --> 01:26:00,390
At least a month ago, somebody said, hey, dude, how do you feel about D4?

1289
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:03,390
And I went, you do not want to hear my D4 opinion.

1290
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:06,159
Oh, no, you don't want to hear it.

1291
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:07,619
And they were like, oh, shit, he hates it.

1292
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,779
And I'm like, oh, I hate it.

1293
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:12,159
So excuse me. I'm sorry.

1294
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:17,310
Yeah, but now you're allowed to like actually say it.

1295
01:26:17,909 --> 01:26:20,109
I did. You've been given permission.

1296
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,010
Who gave you permission?

1297
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,810
Who in the story? But he gave me permission.

1298
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:26,550
I just decided that, you know, OK, listen,

1299
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:30,550
I think Diablo four is a good video game

1300
01:26:31,289 --> 01:26:35,189
that is that is not going to be done for like three years.

1301
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,130
That's my real opinion.

1302
01:26:37,149 --> 01:26:40,899
OK, I think there is a good video game there,

1303
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:43,899
but it's going to take like four years before it gets there.

1304
01:26:46,750 --> 01:26:51,829
Spy. It really was a spy.

1305
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:55,260
Only four.

1306
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,899
I don't know.

1307
01:26:56,899 --> 01:26:59,199
I'm going to play Path of Exile two anyways.

1308
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,760
So what the who fucking cares?

1309
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,180
Oh, he a real one.

1310
01:27:04,779 --> 01:27:05,880
I played D4.

1311
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,260
It was like, it was all right.

1312
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,760
Like the end game was kind of fucking terrible.

1313
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,119
And I was like, whatever, I'm done.

1314
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:13,319
I don't want to have the same unique drop eight times.

1315
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,079
I'm done. That's it.

1316
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:23,880
That's all I need to say. That's it.

1317
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,859
Do you need more of an opinion?

1318
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:27,260
I think that covers it.

1319
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:29,420
I need your opinion on Ghost.

1320
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:34,010
Hold on. Have an opinion on it.

1321
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:39,140
All right. See if I can get.

1322
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:44,289
Oh, I need a teleporter.

1323
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:47,390
It's bad. I need someone to destroy the mini sentry

1324
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:51,789
that is in the complete wide open next to the cart.

1325
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,210
I'm an engineer.

1326
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:56,350
No, the uber soldier.

1327
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:59,810
Please. Hey, hey, look, bud.

1328
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:05,880
I'm an engineer.

1329
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:09,380
I saw practical problems.

1330
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:25,229
That's you right now. Yeah.

1331
01:28:25,229 --> 01:28:27,510
That was a loud spy decloak sound.

1332
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:42,420
I don't know where he is.

1333
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,449
They're all coming up that way.

1334
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:47,630
What the fuck did I just do?

1335
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,930
What just happened? Oh, right.

1336
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,109
That's what I wanted.

1337
01:28:50,109 --> 01:28:51,670
Oh, my fucking God.

1338
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:54,369
I I pressed four and then five and then one and then two

1339
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:57,970
and then three and four and then five and then two and then one and three.

1340
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:01,010
I got to get my muscle memory back to playing engineer.

1341
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:10,470
Still there, though.

1342
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,770
Thanks for the teleporter, Chum.

1343
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,180
You're welcome.

1344
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:17,729
Really kind of need to move it up.

1345
01:29:17,729 --> 01:29:23,420
I did. I'm sorry.

1346
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:26,020
I respect you as an engineer.

1347
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,859
We are about to get this point, though.

1348
01:29:27,859 --> 01:29:31,930
We are. Now I'm going to go over here

1349
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:38,569
and try to build up some shit over here.

1350
01:29:38,569 --> 01:29:45,369
I'm going to. OK.

1351
01:29:45,369 --> 01:29:48,689
Everything is good now.

1352
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:50,250
In fact, I might might.

1353
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,109
I don't want to move it that far because I don't want anyone to get killed.

1354
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:55,909
Where is it in this role?

1355
01:29:55,909 --> 01:29:57,189
Pyro, I can help you.

1356
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:58,890
I'm like the only pyre on the team.

1357
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:01,840
Oh, you're good.

1358
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,039
OK, but I thought it was about teamwork.

1359
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:11,380
It is until it's me.

1360
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:20,289
I think we're just going to win by right.

1361
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:26,439
I don't know where he's going, but he went that way.

1362
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:28,869
You know what? Fuck it. I'm going to make it quicker.

1363
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:30,850
I'm going to this is stupid, but whatever.

1364
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:35,659
It's like an extra five steps you don't take.

1365
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:37,300
That will be the difference maker.

1366
01:30:37,319 --> 01:30:55,079
That actually might help.

1367
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:58,189
Oh, come on. Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.

1368
01:30:58,189 --> 01:31:00,789
Help, help, help.

1369
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:06,630
Entrance teleport. Wait, what's going on?

1370
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,500
Teleporter. Wait, what did I what did I do?

1371
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,600
Did you do it backwards?

1372
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,699
No, no, I didn't.

1373
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:15,539
This is teleporter exit.

1374
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:27,250
But yeah, you're good.

1375
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:31,439
You're doing great.

1376
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:32,680
And I am.

1377
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,819
My buttons are so fucked up.

1378
01:31:34,819 --> 01:31:35,979
It's like most button.

1379
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,300
Why is it mouse for to do that?

1380
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,199
OK, that's very weird.

1381
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,699
It's not three. It's mouse for.

1382
01:31:45,859 --> 01:31:48,239
I I wish I could explain why that just happened.

1383
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,449
Are you blew up the exit?

1384
01:31:53,449 --> 01:31:55,449
I know. But my key binds.

1385
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:57,989
I had to have had a reason like 10 years ago to do that.

1386
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:02,670
What was the reason?

1387
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:03,850
You're still the same person.

1388
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,949
What did you do that for? Why did you do this?

1389
01:32:05,949 --> 01:32:13,039
I just killed a spy.

1390
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:20,899
Ah, oh, no, he didn't even kill my shit.

1391
01:32:26,579 --> 01:32:29,880
Oh, no. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

1392
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,489
Just do you need a hand?

1393
01:32:33,489 --> 01:32:35,329
Everyone's just waiting for it to be done.

1394
01:32:35,329 --> 01:32:49,479
And it's not even fucking close.

1395
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:52,890
But he's at the entrance.

1396
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:59,329
You motherfucker. I'm coming back there.

1397
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:01,029
I think we're losing.

1398
01:33:01,029 --> 01:33:02,930
We need the teleporter now. It's there.

1399
01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:03,930
It's there. It's there. It's there.

1400
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:08,149
I promise. We need it now.

1401
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,109
Well, you can't just demand things, OK?

1402
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,890
Fuck you.

1403
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:25,119
This guy just killed like three of us.

1404
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:42,989
What are you now remembering?

1405
01:33:42,989 --> 01:33:46,109
The Huntsman's not OK.

1406
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:48,750
Like being killed by it or using it.

1407
01:33:48,750 --> 01:33:50,449
It does a lot of damage.

1408
01:33:50,449 --> 01:33:51,489
It's really hard to use.

1409
01:33:51,489 --> 01:33:52,649
What's the last time you tried it?

1410
01:33:52,649 --> 01:33:55,250
When the enemy team has a lot of heavies,

1411
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,590
I'm saying it's it's like brutal for them.

1412
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:58,989
They can't really move.

1413
01:33:58,989 --> 01:34:02,289
And it's like 360 for like no charge time.

1414
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:04,630
You just hop out at a heavy.

1415
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:15,100
Yeah. And you get the sonar arrow.

1416
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,579
Keep track. I'm making.

1417
01:34:16,579 --> 01:34:23,130
I'm being very aware of everybody.

1418
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:24,529
This is risky. This is really risky.

1419
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:27,430
But fuck it. I'm doing it.

1420
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,829
Insanely risky.

1421
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,369
We're moving up. We're on the cart.

1422
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:31,170
We're winning right now.

1423
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:35,079
If you're moving up, it's a good time.

1424
01:34:35,079 --> 01:34:38,420
Oh, that motherfucker back here.

1425
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:39,579
That's why he's going to get me. He's going to get me.

1426
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:40,520
He's going to get me. He's good.

1427
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,239
He's good. He's really good.

1428
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,840
Got him. Or I got one of them.

1429
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,239
There's a few.

1430
01:34:51,239 --> 01:35:06,850
How did he not die?

1431
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:08,750
What the fuck? I tried to back up,

1432
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,109
but he still got me with it.

1433
01:35:10,109 --> 01:35:11,449
What just happened?

1434
01:35:11,449 --> 01:35:13,689
I knew he was going to do that shit.

1435
01:35:13,689 --> 01:35:16,689
So I backed up and he still got behind me.

1436
01:35:16,689 --> 01:35:19,510
What the fuck are you talking about?

1437
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:22,029
Spy. What the fuck?

1438
01:35:22,029 --> 01:35:23,350
I knew he was going to do that.

1439
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:26,329
So I backed up and he still got it.

1440
01:35:26,329 --> 01:35:28,239
Spy.

1441
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,819
You got trick stabbed.

1442
01:35:30,819 --> 01:35:41,779
Yeah. That's whatever.

1443
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:47,909
Your Boston is coming out now.

1444
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,180
Oh, we're good.

1445
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,199
You're not going to fucking trick stab me anymore.

1446
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:57,890
God damn it.

1447
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,590
Can we get a teleporter?

1448
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:01,930
Dude, this spy is just,

1449
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:06,619
he's just killing me over and over again.

1450
01:36:06,619 --> 01:36:08,720
There's a dude that's just making my life a living hell.

1451
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:12,770
Even if I try to look for him.

1452
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:15,229
Okay. Can we get a teleporter is what I asked.

1453
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:16,409
Yeah. It was there.

1454
01:36:16,409 --> 01:36:19,109
And then you, you're not spy.

1455
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:24,399
You're not, you're not spy checking.

1456
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:29,359
Good enough.

1457
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:31,220
Dude, you're washed up.

1458
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:36,060
I was washed up in TF2 probably like seven or eight years ago.

1459
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,260
So that's all right.

1460
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:46,159
I was washed up like years ago.

1461
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:49,159
Yeah. Yeah.

1462
01:36:49,159 --> 01:36:51,800
Or at least we're still getting scared Saturdays.

1463
01:36:51,800 --> 01:37:01,960
Yeah.

1464
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:10,949
Oh shit. The sniper up there.

1465
01:37:10,949 --> 01:37:11,989
You know what? Fuck it.

1466
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:12,810
Fuck it. We're going in here.

1467
01:37:12,810 --> 01:37:17,039
Fuck it. We're going in here.

1468
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:18,180
Are we?

1469
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:19,020
Yeah. Fuck it.

1470
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:21,590
Let's just bring a teleporter in here.

1471
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:23,479
Yeah. There's a good room.

1472
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:25,560
That sniper is going to try to kill us.

1473
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,710
Yeah. He is.

1474
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,439
He's gaming.

1475
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:34,029
Can't do much about it.

1476
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:40,640
Shit. Okay. Well, it's not there anymore.

1477
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:42,100
You should do it in the room before that

1478
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,060
is where you should be putting it.

1479
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:45,359
Probably.

1480
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,600
We still won.

1481
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,460
Nice job.

1482
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,859
Did we earn face cam yet?

1483
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:53,920
Maybe in like another 10 minutes.

1484
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:03,279
If you're good.

1485
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:04,260
That was good.

1486
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,119
You don't think we should stay?

1487
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:07,100
No, you should not.

1488
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,220
Okay.

1489
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:16,619
As a professional kill streak haver, we should leave.

1490
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,989
I'm going to go for the Huntsman.

1491
01:38:20,989 --> 01:38:22,729
I used to be so good with this.

1492
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:23,909
And I mean that unironically.

1493
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:26,319
This video is on my channel with me

1494
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:30,670
just fucking destroying like 20 kills in one life and shit.

1495
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:32,909
It's I don't even know how I go back

1496
01:38:32,909 --> 01:38:35,800
and watch those old TF2 Huntsman videos.

1497
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,739
And I say, how did I even do that?

1498
01:38:37,739 --> 01:38:41,880
I could never do that now ever.

1499
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,920
You can put your mind to it.

1500
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,119
You can do anything.

1501
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:49,789
There's one string in a, I think it's on nucleus.

1502
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:52,630
I just hit like 10 headshots in a row

1503
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:56,470
over the course of like maybe 30 to 40 seconds.

1504
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:58,369
It's fucking crazy.

1505
01:38:58,369 --> 01:39:00,229
Was that German mad?

1506
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,130
No, no, no, no.

1507
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,689
This is like just a regular just commentary.

1508
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:06,170
The same thing.

1509
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:08,659
We're playing nucleus in that video.

1510
01:39:08,659 --> 01:39:11,939
I will never play an FPS game better than that.

1511
01:39:11,939 --> 01:39:13,000
I was so motivated.

1512
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,779
I hit every shot I took.

1513
01:39:20,779 --> 01:39:22,579
Oh, I forgot about the shields, right?

1514
01:39:22,579 --> 01:39:23,680
This is what I had on.

1515
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:31,279
Can't be burnt.

1516
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:33,500
Oh, I'll do Girardi.

1517
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,340
See if I still got it.

1518
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,180
I definitely don't.

1519
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:39,979
This weapon's really hard to use.

1520
01:39:39,979 --> 01:39:42,670
That's why they call it the Luxman.

1521
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:47,810
Cause it's very difficult to use.

1522
01:39:47,829 --> 01:39:51,859
I shouldn't be using this.

1523
01:39:51,859 --> 01:39:57,949
I got a cool hat though.

1524
01:39:57,949 --> 01:39:59,529
Doesn't that matter?

1525
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:00,930
It does matter a whole lot.

1526
01:40:07,979 --> 01:40:09,359
Just let me play.

1527
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:32,319
Nice.

1528
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:34,859
But that jump of all the jump.

1529
01:40:39,579 --> 01:40:43,460
I gotta go a little higher.

1530
01:40:43,460 --> 01:40:46,819
Oh goodness.

1531
01:40:46,819 --> 01:40:51,199
Oh, they're all Girardi.

1532
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:12,270
Oh, I thought it was right in the head.

1533
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,779
The level one in the corner.

1534
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:20,720
Destroy the sentry now.

1535
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:24,810
Ouch.

1536
01:41:25,689 --> 01:41:28,359
I'm doing all right.

1537
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:29,199
You gotta go a little bit higher.

1538
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:39,859
There's a little bit of drop on the Huntsman.

1539
01:41:39,859 --> 01:41:41,560
Show us all your hats.

1540
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,699
I'll show my backpack in a little bit.

1541
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:44,539
He doesn't care.

1542
01:41:44,539 --> 01:41:45,359
What the?

1543
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,359
No, no, kill me.

1544
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:06,939
I got some health here.

1545
01:42:06,939 --> 01:42:16,560
I can't do it.

1546
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,560
Yeah, I did that.

1547
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,000
I'm the reason we pushed the cart.

1548
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,800
Cause their whole team was in spawn chasing me around.

1549
01:42:32,949 --> 01:42:46,859
That was me.

1550
01:42:46,859 --> 01:42:47,920
Is that Pyro though?

1551
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,659
Guys flying around.

1552
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:58,340
Holy shit.

1553
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,859
That guy went across the whole map.

1554
01:42:59,859 --> 01:43:08,409
Cause I'm in zooming.

1555
01:43:08,409 --> 01:43:09,250
All right.

1556
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:16,100
This guy got to be fucking kidding me.

1557
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:18,800
I thought I could catch him on the way down.

1558
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,640
All right.

1559
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,600
Can somebody kill this market garden soldier?

1560
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:30,819
They're just flying around the map and killing everybody.

1561
01:43:30,819 --> 01:43:32,340
Fuckin' stupidness.

1562
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,079
I hate market gardener battles.

1563
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,859
Are you doing it too?

1564
01:43:36,859 --> 01:43:37,699
Yeah.

1565
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,069
All right.

1566
01:43:50,069 --> 01:43:50,909
This is where you shine as Huntsman

1567
01:43:50,909 --> 01:43:52,050
because people just poke their heads out

1568
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:54,930
and you get headshots every five seconds.

1569
01:43:54,930 --> 01:43:59,159
I want to see five right now.

1570
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,680
A little bit higher.

1571
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:08,920
I'm aiming a little too low.

1572
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,439
Oh my God, dude.

1573
01:44:10,439 --> 01:44:15,069
Fucking somebody kill him.

1574
01:44:15,069 --> 01:44:17,319
You just shoot him.

1575
01:44:17,319 --> 01:44:18,720
I did and it didn't kill him.

1576
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,520
He was covered in Gerardi too.

1577
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,199
The guy with no gun?

1578
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,279
The guy market gardening.

1579
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:26,399
With no gun?

1580
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:27,520
I Gerardi'd him.

1581
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:28,960
I shot him with an arrow.

1582
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:32,920
He was still alive and killed me with the fucking shovel.

1583
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:33,760
Okay.

1584
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,600
All right.

1585
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:35,439
Okay.

1586
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:36,279
That's what happened.

1587
01:44:36,279 --> 01:44:38,239
Okay.

1588
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,079
All right.

1589
01:44:39,079 --> 01:44:39,899
Okay.

1590
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:40,739
Okay.

1591
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:41,579
All right.

1592
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:48,079
Okay.

1593
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:48,920
Okay.

1594
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:49,760
He's back.

1595
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:50,579
He's back.

1596
01:44:50,579 --> 01:44:51,420
He's back.

1597
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:52,260
He's back.

1598
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,079
And he's just, he's back.

1599
01:44:53,079 --> 01:44:53,920
And that's what he's doing.

1600
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:54,760
He's just trying to kill me.

1601
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,579
He's just coming for me.

1602
01:44:55,579 --> 01:44:56,979
He's coming to kill me.

1603
01:44:56,979 --> 01:44:57,819
That's what he's doing.

1604
01:44:57,819 --> 01:45:04,510
That's what he's doing.

1605
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:05,350
That's what he's doing.

1606
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:06,189
They respected it.

1607
01:45:06,189 --> 01:45:12,739
I like, I appreciate that.

1608
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:13,880
You sucks.

1609
01:45:16,119 --> 01:45:19,180
Spot.

1610
01:45:19,180 --> 01:45:28,430
I got him.

1611
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:29,710
Oh my fucking God.

1612
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:30,529
Okay.

1613
01:45:30,529 --> 01:45:31,369
I think he comes over here,

1614
01:45:31,369 --> 01:45:33,789
tries to kill me and then runs until I get a full health

1615
01:45:33,789 --> 01:45:36,350
and then comes back to kill me again.

1616
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,720
Yeah.

1617
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,560
Why wouldn't that?

1618
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:47,260
That's what you do in team fortress too.

1619
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,079
You go, you try and kill them on respawn.

1620
01:45:49,079 --> 01:46:01,529
You can get health if your health's low.

1621
01:46:01,529 --> 01:46:02,369
I wasn't in the head.

1622
01:46:02,369 --> 01:46:03,210
Shit.

1623
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:04,050
It looks like it.

1624
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:11,000
There we go.

1625
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:21,779
Oh, he just saved your sniper friend's life.

1626
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:27,979
He's beginning to believe just a little.

1627
01:46:27,979 --> 01:46:30,739
Ooh, a teleporter.

1628
01:46:30,739 --> 01:46:32,220
He won't look at me.

1629
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:38,750
What was that?

1630
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:43,920
Like fucking weasel laugh.

1631
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,850
That's the sound you make before you switch class.

1632
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:53,039
I hit him again, but it didn't kill him.

1633
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:58,689
Trying to get him up.

1634
01:46:58,689 --> 01:47:05,819
Shit, he hit me.

1635
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:06,819
I wish these were headshots,

1636
01:47:06,819 --> 01:47:11,439
but they're like neck shots.

1637
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:12,520
I still have to go even higher.

1638
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,800
Yeah.

1639
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,989
I'm afraid to go higher.

1640
01:47:15,989 --> 01:47:17,109
You won't get hurt.

1641
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:19,670
I used to sit on what TR walkway

1642
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:20,989
for like three hours straight,

1643
01:47:20,989 --> 01:47:27,909
just shooting at people with a Huntsman.

1644
01:47:27,909 --> 01:47:30,539
TR walkway is the real one.

1645
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:33,300
Oh yeah, it was.

1646
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,140
All right.

1647
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:51,199
Who's up there?

1648
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,079
I think right now you like know when I die.

1649
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,720
Why don't you make noises when you die?

1650
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:02,699
I am making noises.

1651
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:04,239
You don't hear them.

1652
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:09,699
Like death noises.

1653
01:48:09,699 --> 01:48:10,539
No, no.

1654
01:48:10,539 --> 01:48:12,239
I'm seeing a lot of pogs.

1655
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:16,020
No, you can't pog until I get the headshots down again.

1656
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,109
But I mean, I'm making noise when I get hit.

1657
01:48:20,109 --> 01:48:21,390
No, you're not.

1658
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:25,640
Yes, I am.

1659
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:34,130
No, you're not.

1660
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:41,380
I might need sensitivity down a little more.

1661
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:43,020
There's no such thing as sensitivity.

1662
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,579
Fail RP.

1663
01:48:45,579 --> 01:48:46,420
What?

1664
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:48,359
They have a cheater.

1665
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:50,439
He didn't even,

1666
01:48:50,439 --> 01:48:57,840
his gun didn't even turn and look at me.

1667
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,829
Shit.

1668
01:49:02,829 --> 01:49:05,039
Oh, we're on it.

1669
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:08,239
But you can't kick bots if you're on the enemy team.

1670
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,199
Someone from the other team has to kick them.

1671
01:49:10,199 --> 01:49:11,279
It's kind of awkward.

1672
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:25,699
Hey, where was he?

1673
01:49:25,699 --> 01:49:31,460
Oh, I kind of fucked it up.

1674
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:35,000
You typed that in party chat, by the way.

1675
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,159
I don't actually know what the all chat is.

1676
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:40,880
I really do not know what my button is.

1677
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,079
You were like privately.

1678
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:54,850
Oh, that was a good one.

1679
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:56,649
It's why apparently.

1680
01:49:56,649 --> 01:50:00,470
Yeah, I got it.

1681
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:14,960
We have a lot of time though.

1682
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,979
Whoa.

1683
01:50:16,979 --> 01:50:21,170
Holy shit.

1684
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:23,250
Ah, I thought I could get two.

1685
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,770
Oh my God, I should have just swung at them

1686
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:29,479
with the fucking melee.

1687
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:32,229
Get da-da-donked.

1688
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:34,149
Dude, my energy levels are increasing.

1689
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:36,789
What does that mean?

1690
01:50:36,789 --> 01:50:38,670
That means exactly what it means.

1691
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:39,789
Got it.

1692
01:50:39,789 --> 01:50:41,789
One shot of germ of protein shake

1693
01:50:41,789 --> 01:50:44,069
and your energy levels will be increasing.

1694
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:50,569
Cool.

1695
01:50:50,569 --> 01:50:51,409
What?

1696
01:50:51,409 --> 01:50:52,250
No way.

1697
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,930
All right, now this is where,

1698
01:50:53,930 --> 01:50:55,010
this is gonna shine.

1699
01:50:56,189 --> 01:51:00,300
I got a cool hat.

1700
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:04,149
Make sure you buy Germa's milk.

1701
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:14,319
Oh, that's not for sale.

1702
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:15,600
Let me just hold on.

1703
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,869
They kind of still have a cheating bot on their team.

1704
01:51:19,869 --> 01:51:21,840
You wanna leave?

1705
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,800
No, it's upward.

1706
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:26,159
That's why you stay.

1707
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:31,060
Oh, check this out.

1708
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,260
Check this out.

1709
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:35,350
Does this still work?

1710
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:36,909
Like when everybody gets up to the front gate

1711
01:51:36,949 --> 01:51:39,989
and you can hit them with Jurati before the gate opens.

1712
01:51:39,989 --> 01:51:41,699
That's the thing, right?

1713
01:51:41,699 --> 01:51:42,699
What is?

1714
01:51:42,699 --> 01:51:45,340
Like I can coat them with Jurati like at one second

1715
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:46,380
because they're all gonna sit at the door

1716
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:48,220
and be impatient.

1717
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,180
You can try.

1718
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,539
Are you good enough?

1719
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:54,149
I think so.

1720
01:51:54,149 --> 01:51:54,989
Ready?

1721
01:51:54,989 --> 01:51:56,869
Here comes everybody in one, two, three.

1722
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:17,909
He just goes back in spawn.

1723
01:52:17,909 --> 01:52:19,750
Oh, I thought he was gonna walk back.

1724
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:20,869
Where are you?

1725
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:22,260
Spawn.

1726
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,739
Spawn, you dead?

1727
01:52:23,739 --> 01:52:24,659
I just died.

1728
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:28,199
How come you didn't make a death noise?

1729
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,279
That was kind of a before death sound.

1730
01:52:34,909 --> 01:52:35,750
I went, oh.

1731
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:36,590
When you die, you're gonna be like,

1732
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:38,149
oh man, I made a mistake there.

1733
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:39,430
What I actually should have done is,

1734
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:43,800
like, no, you're dead, dude.

1735
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,079
Play scout?

1736
01:52:47,079 --> 01:52:53,199
I could, maybe.

1737
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:55,560
That hurt.

1738
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:57,890
Where are you?

1739
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:58,729
I need you.

1740
01:52:58,729 --> 01:52:59,569
I'm a medic.

1741
01:52:59,569 --> 01:53:08,640
It's a market gardener.

1742
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:27,939
Ah, he missed.

1743
01:53:27,939 --> 01:53:36,680
This dang fool.

1744
01:53:36,680 --> 01:53:43,380
Oh, I was about to go on a fucking run right there.

1745
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:44,220
Where are you?

1746
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:46,340
I'm playing Huntsman Sniper.

1747
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:47,180
What do you need me for?

1748
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:48,579
I need you.

1749
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:55,010
I'm dead.

1750
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:57,729
I'm alive now, and I just said medic.

1751
01:53:57,729 --> 01:53:59,329
I have like a cool hat on.

1752
01:53:59,329 --> 01:54:00,170
I have like a.

1753
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:02,390
There's a soldier behind you.

1754
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:03,229
What?

1755
01:54:03,229 --> 01:54:04,500
Where?

1756
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:07,420
Is he dead?

1757
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:08,899
He's dead, man.

1758
01:54:08,899 --> 01:54:10,140
You on 50 FOV?

1759
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:13,800
No.

1760
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,590
It'd be funny if I was.

1761
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:18,310
Why are you doing that?

1762
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:20,390
Don't pull a card, just blink.

1763
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:21,630
Why would you do that?

1764
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:23,350
Why not?

1765
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:25,699
You're going to get screamed at in the chat now.

1766
01:54:25,699 --> 01:54:39,229
Oh, this is a serious match.

1767
01:54:39,229 --> 01:54:40,590
I thought there was going to be a lot more people

1768
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:50,289
out there than it was.

1769
01:54:50,289 --> 01:54:57,850
Oh shit.

1770
01:54:57,850 --> 01:55:02,729
I'm going to play like gamer medic.

1771
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:04,210
Play with a real weapon, please.

1772
01:55:04,210 --> 01:55:05,050
Okay.

1773
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,399
One random sticky.

1774
01:55:11,399 --> 01:55:12,239
Heavy goes first.

1775
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,899
Heavy goes first, that's priority.

1776
01:55:14,899 --> 01:55:15,739
You get priority.

1777
01:55:15,739 --> 01:55:16,859
You're heavy.

1778
01:55:16,859 --> 01:55:38,489
I'm a support class.

1779
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:45,210
I got you, Frank the fish.

1780
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:54,729
Everyone is hurt all the time.

1781
01:55:54,729 --> 01:55:55,930
Later, dude.

1782
01:55:55,930 --> 01:55:57,569
What do you mean later?

1783
01:55:57,569 --> 01:56:04,170
Our demo just turned off the map.

1784
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:07,550
I got you, Frank the fish.

1785
01:56:07,550 --> 01:56:09,529
Thanks, bro.

1786
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:10,369
Let's get them.

1787
01:56:10,369 --> 01:56:11,210
Let's get them.

1788
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:12,050
Let's get them.

1789
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:12,890
You ready?

1790
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:16,210
Nope, I'm dead.

1791
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:17,050
Coward.

1792
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,229
Actually the heat maker, I don't want it here.

1793
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:24,279
Give me the default.

1794
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:28,880
Heat maker is good, but you got to get a lot of kills.

1795
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,199
That's one of the more you headshots you get, right?

1796
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:32,039
You get asked.

1797
01:56:32,039 --> 01:56:33,279
No, that's the other one.

1798
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:39,550
The bizarre bargain is extremely powerful now.

1799
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:43,689
Would recommend.

1800
01:56:43,689 --> 01:56:46,869
So it's mostly the same as like default,

1801
01:56:46,869 --> 01:56:49,949
unless you get headshots.

1802
01:56:49,949 --> 01:56:53,109
That was a headshot right there.

1803
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:54,829
Oh, you see that 150?

1804
01:56:54,829 --> 01:57:05,750
Almost.

1805
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:06,590
Say it.

1806
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:09,069
I'm trying to...

1807
01:57:09,069 --> 01:57:10,109
Oh, that would have been good.

1808
01:57:10,109 --> 01:57:16,569
It was close.

1809
01:57:16,569 --> 01:57:17,449
I'm gaming, man.

1810
01:57:17,449 --> 01:57:27,060
I'm trying.

1811
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:27,899
What are you doing?

1812
01:57:27,899 --> 01:57:29,300
Get him, get him, get him, get him, get him.

1813
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:30,300
There's nobody to shoot at.

1814
01:57:30,300 --> 01:57:31,140
Come on, shoot.

1815
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,460
There's nobody to shoot at.

1816
01:57:39,779 --> 01:57:42,989
You're up on the leaderboard there.

1817
01:57:42,989 --> 01:57:47,170
That's me, the medic.

1818
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:49,130
Leave it, right?

1819
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:50,569
We're voting upward, right?

1820
01:57:51,529 --> 01:57:52,930
Does that mean we stay?

1821
01:57:52,930 --> 01:57:54,329
Do you want to vote upward?

1822
01:57:54,329 --> 01:57:56,529
I'll click on upward if you want to.

1823
01:57:56,529 --> 01:57:58,880
Can't really click it for some reason.

1824
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,550
Oh, are we staying?

1825
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:02,750
Yeah.

1826
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:03,909
All right, something seems broken though.

1827
01:58:03,909 --> 01:58:04,949
I can't vote anything.

1828
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:08,489
Neither can I.

1829
01:58:08,489 --> 01:58:13,619
Go risk on.

1830
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:15,590
This happens.

1831
01:58:15,590 --> 01:58:19,590
I sure hope it's gold rush.

1832
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:20,670
I love gold rush.

1833
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:25,850
I wouldn't care.

1834
01:58:25,850 --> 01:58:29,090
They nerfed the bonk atomic punch.

1835
01:58:32,420 --> 01:58:35,810
I can see why.

1836
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:36,649
That's the one where you drink it

1837
01:58:36,649 --> 01:58:37,489
and you become invincible

1838
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:39,600
and you just run behind enemy lines.

1839
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,000
Yeah, I think you run slower

1840
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,079
and depending on the amount of damage you take,

1841
01:58:43,079 --> 01:58:46,520
you, after it ends, you get slowed.

1842
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,000
We're on upward.

1843
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,840
You should be happy.

1844
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:49,680
We're on upper.

1845
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:54,710
I am happy.

1846
01:58:54,710 --> 01:59:02,930
What do I want to do?

1847
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:04,770
Should I go flog Pyro?

1848
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:10,989
Not on offense.

1849
01:59:10,989 --> 01:59:22,859
What the hell is going on?

1850
01:59:22,859 --> 01:59:24,800
I got this cool item.

1851
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:29,100
The Nostromo, Napalm-er.

1852
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:31,260
I remember people wanted this shit, didn't they?

1853
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:36,119
Some of the other tie-in items, right?

1854
01:59:36,119 --> 01:59:37,039
Equip the pen.

1855
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:54,710
Get pack is good.

1856
01:59:54,710 --> 01:59:55,550
I think.

1857
01:59:55,550 --> 01:59:56,390
Do you have it?

1858
01:59:56,390 --> 01:59:58,600
Yes, I do.

1859
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,640
You guys like my outfit?

1860
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:02,680
I have the barbecue on my back.

1861
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:05,199
I've got the funny glasses crooked

1862
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:09,359
and I got the, I have the white mask thing.

1863
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:10,760
I think I look pretty good.

1864
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:11,760
You look great.

1865
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,079
I cannot find you.

1866
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:15,500
The right hallway.

1867
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:20,470
What do you mean no?

1868
02:00:20,470 --> 02:00:22,029
You don't like the strip?

1869
02:00:22,029 --> 02:00:23,270
I'm judging, I'm judging it.

1870
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:27,340
I wasn't a no, it was a consideration.

1871
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:28,840
Yes, you look good.

1872
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:33,430
Does it change it if I do this?

1873
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:36,590
This is allowed.

1874
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:37,430
Oh, hey.

1875
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:43,300
What?

1876
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:48,039
How do I look?

1877
02:00:48,039 --> 02:00:49,399
Ooh, you got a skateboard.

1878
02:00:49,399 --> 02:00:50,479
That's kind of cool.

1879
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:52,359
Ooh, what is that?

1880
02:00:52,359 --> 02:00:55,720
You have like a fishy mode.

1881
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:57,159
I tried to shoot it back.

1882
02:00:57,159 --> 02:00:58,439
If I shot that crit rocket back,

1883
02:00:58,439 --> 02:01:08,609
that would have been fucking awesome.

1884
02:01:08,609 --> 02:01:10,409
All right, sometimes I'm into Pyro

1885
02:01:10,409 --> 02:01:12,409
and I do well and sometimes I just die

1886
02:01:12,409 --> 02:01:24,260
after walking out the front door over and over again.

1887
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:26,939
Ouch.

1888
02:01:26,939 --> 02:01:31,439
I'm a death magnet.

1889
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:32,880
What does this hit sound?

1890
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,000
It's kind of like the little gurgles.

1891
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,500
I don't know what it is.

1892
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:40,220
Jeez, that guy killed me very fast.

1893
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,939
What the hell?

1894
02:01:41,939 --> 02:01:42,779
Degreaser?

1895
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:54,840
I died really quick.

1896
02:01:54,840 --> 02:02:01,020
Oh, I got shot by a sniper.

1897
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:04,399
Excuse me.

1898
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:24,439
Can't pull me.

1899
02:02:24,439 --> 02:02:25,399
Oh, it's so low.

1900
02:02:25,399 --> 02:02:26,239
Nice.

1901
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:34,960
Good job, good job.

1902
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,800
I'm in trouble now.

1903
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:43,210
Oh, good heals.

1904
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:44,050
Come here, come here.

1905
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:46,479
I can put you out.

1906
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:47,640
Oh, I didn't know that Dumbleman

1907
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,960
can equip the parachute.

1908
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:05,010
Oh, he got stuck in the wall.

1909
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:15,239
I would have hit him.

1910
02:03:15,239 --> 02:03:23,909
I'm going around.

1911
02:03:23,909 --> 02:03:27,020
Ooh, they're so focused.

1912
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,859
Yeah, we're gaming.

1913
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:30,560
These are absolutely gaming right now.

1914
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:31,880
Oh shit.

1915
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:37,529
I fucked it up.

1916
02:03:37,529 --> 02:03:42,100
We please see some, I'll play scout on defense.

1917
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,810
Can we please see some scout, please?

1918
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:51,270
We've been waiting.

1919
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:56,130
In 2023 TF2, what is your favorite class to play?

1920
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:58,529
Yeah.

1921
02:03:58,529 --> 02:03:59,770
Scout.

1922
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:01,609
Seriously?

1923
02:04:01,609 --> 02:04:04,689
Yeah.

1924
02:04:04,689 --> 02:04:06,770
Sometimes I like doing a little bit of jumping,

1925
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:09,250
but the scout guy kills everybody

1926
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:19,050
unless there's a sentry.

1927
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:30,560
Jumped over it, but it's all right.

1928
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,060
Shit.

1929
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:35,670
Oh, he's going to go up there.

1930
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:38,359
Damn it.

1931
02:04:38,359 --> 02:04:40,000
You have a cat puke hit sound.

1932
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:56,100
It kind of is.

1933
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:00,239
Watch that right side.

1934
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:01,199
He's actually dead dead.

1935
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:09,550
I don't think so.

1936
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:10,590
Oh, fuck you.

1937
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:11,710
It didn't hit anybody.

1938
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:12,750
What the fuck?

1939
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:13,590
How?

1940
02:05:13,869 --> 02:05:15,350
It threaded a needle, dude.

1941
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:26,239
That was, oh, come on.

1942
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:27,079
Shit.

1943
02:05:27,079 --> 02:05:34,819
Save the crits.

1944
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:37,770
Play with pyro vision on.

1945
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:38,609
Yeah, I'll do it.

1946
02:05:38,609 --> 02:05:47,630
That sounds fun.

1947
02:05:47,630 --> 02:06:00,319
Oh, that's not going to work.

1948
02:06:02,189 --> 02:06:05,840
Oh, I hit him.

1949
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:07,359
You're using the volcano fragment.

1950
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:08,319
Oh, mega lol.

1951
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:10,399
What's wrong with it?

1952
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:13,079
Oh, the rift volcano weapon

1953
02:06:13,079 --> 02:06:16,079
from rift, the great game rift.

1954
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:18,310
You can, yeah, this is fine.

1955
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:20,520
It's a cool weapon.

1956
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,420
That's the worst weapon in the game,

1957
02:06:23,420 --> 02:06:35,189
but isn't the cool factor of having a fire axe cool?

1958
02:06:36,029 --> 02:06:38,189
The sentry in the middle of the open.

1959
02:06:38,189 --> 02:06:39,029
Maybe.

1960
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:53,560
Oh, I forget.

1961
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:55,800
This is like the stereo weapon.

1962
02:06:55,800 --> 02:07:12,090
I can hear this in the middle of my brain when I shoot it.

1963
02:07:12,090 --> 02:07:13,810
Sniper, I got him standing still for you.

1964
02:07:13,810 --> 02:07:15,970
I am the distractor.

1965
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:20,520
I'm medic.

1966
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:21,960
I switched to medic.

1967
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:23,960
It's me and backfield huntsman guy.

1968
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:33,159
Everyone's over healed.

1969
02:07:33,159 --> 02:07:38,079
All right, go get him.

1970
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:39,479
Oh, that's bad news.

1971
02:07:39,479 --> 02:07:45,939
Oh, I didn't know they were coming up that far.

1972
02:07:45,939 --> 02:07:47,060
Yeah, get it, get it, get it.

1973
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,579
Okay, I get it.

1974
02:07:52,579 --> 02:07:53,420
I shouldn't have been up that far.

1975
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:56,399
That was stupid.

1976
02:07:56,399 --> 02:07:57,560
That was bad news.

1977
02:07:57,560 --> 02:07:58,399
Bad chest.

1978
02:07:58,399 --> 02:07:59,279
That was kind of a tuber voice,

1979
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:02,590
but we're playing TF2, that's the point.

1980
02:08:02,590 --> 02:08:03,510
We're back, baby.

1981
02:08:03,510 --> 02:08:14,810
We're back.

1982
02:08:14,810 --> 02:08:19,739
Feel like I'm fishing.

1983
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:20,779
All right, come on.

1984
02:08:20,779 --> 02:08:22,739
Come on, Bloop-O.

1985
02:08:22,739 --> 02:08:25,779
Bloop-O is gonna win this for us right now.

1986
02:08:25,779 --> 02:08:36,300
Oh my damn it, dude.

1987
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:49,640
I promise I'll get one Uber.

1988
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:51,569
Oh, I see what you're doing.

1989
02:08:51,569 --> 02:08:57,699
Smart, smart.

1990
02:08:57,699 --> 02:08:58,739
All right, I have to hit.

1991
02:08:58,859 --> 02:08:59,699
All right, we're getting attacked.

1992
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:07,340
We're getting attacked now.

1993
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:10,340
All right, come on, Bloop-O.

1994
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:13,770
Come on, Bloop-O.

1995
02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:20,069
Bloop-O's about to get on this.

1996
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:22,079
Get the fuck out of here.

1997
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:22,920
We're good, we're good.

1998
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:27,329
I got an Uber.

1999
02:09:27,329 --> 02:09:37,899
Let's publish time, let's go.

2000
02:09:37,899 --> 02:09:38,739
Nice.

2001
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:42,979
Why does it take the announcer for this to happen?

2002
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:49,800
It does.

2003
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,600
Dude, Bloop-O, I'm telling you.

2004
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:56,130
No, Bloop-O, you're good.

2005
02:09:56,130 --> 02:09:58,489
Is that the heater?

2006
02:09:58,689 --> 02:10:00,409
That weapon's pretty cool.

2007
02:10:00,409 --> 02:10:02,880
The anti-spy heavy gun.

2008
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:06,479
That thing's cool.

2009
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:08,079
Dude, just let's roll it.

2010
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:14,470
Don't even, just don't even stop.

2011
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:23,390
I'm sorry, Bloop-O, I gotta spread it around.

2012
02:10:23,390 --> 02:10:26,279
Use your anti-spy gun.

2013
02:10:26,279 --> 02:10:31,119
I had to use it.

2014
02:10:31,119 --> 02:10:39,890
That's all right.

2015
02:10:39,890 --> 02:10:41,170
Hey, that was a good push though.

2016
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:47,590
We got ourselves another three and a half minutes.

2017
02:10:47,590 --> 02:10:49,189
All right, what song am I doing?

2018
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:53,760
Poker Face by Lady Gaga, mum, mum, mum, mum.

2019
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,079
Wow, actually nice.

2020
02:10:55,079 --> 02:10:58,329
Just drop.

2021
02:10:58,329 --> 02:10:59,170
I got it.

2022
02:11:07,229 --> 02:11:15,989
I thought I was gonna hit him with at least one of those.

2023
02:11:15,989 --> 02:11:18,189
That was just the equivalent of,

2024
02:11:18,189 --> 02:11:21,109
I'm like two or three miles away from that guy

2025
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:24,109
and I'm throwing rocks at him and he has a sniper rifle

2026
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:24,989
and I'm sitting there in the open

2027
02:11:24,989 --> 02:11:27,670
just throwing multiple small rocks

2028
02:11:27,670 --> 02:11:30,399
that are not gonna go that far.

2029
02:11:30,399 --> 02:11:31,399
And why are you doing that?

2030
02:11:31,399 --> 02:11:34,800
It once fell off.

2031
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:36,319
Are you one ear or two ear?

2032
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:38,880
It's a two ear, it's two ear right now.

2033
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:42,359
And you're able to function, what changed?

2034
02:11:42,359 --> 02:11:43,920
I think that's, I'm talking a little louder

2035
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,119
because I can't hear myself talk.

2036
02:11:46,119 --> 02:11:49,109
Maybe that's why I'm being louder today.

2037
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:50,270
I'm proud of you.

2038
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:51,470
Thanks.

2039
02:11:51,470 --> 02:11:58,439
You're my little baby boo boo.

2040
02:11:58,439 --> 02:12:04,630
I feel like I haven't seen you in a while.

2041
02:12:04,630 --> 02:12:08,069
I was in the back line like all game doing absolutely nothing.

2042
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:20,220
It, I was having a good time.

2043
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:28,840
No, no, no, no, don't let him do that.

2044
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:31,170
Ooh, where is it?

2045
02:12:31,170 --> 02:12:32,329
It's unkillable.

2046
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:37,399
50 HP stationary thing.

2047
02:12:37,399 --> 02:12:39,899
Beware.

2048
02:12:39,939 --> 02:12:42,060
All right, I have, what class are you playing?

2049
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:43,460
I'm sniper, you were just healing me.

2050
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:46,699
I know, but sometimes I'm not Ubering you.

2051
02:12:46,699 --> 02:12:47,579
Let's do it.

2052
02:12:47,579 --> 02:12:49,460
Okay, one, two, three, go.

2053
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,159
Why did you tell me to do that?

2054
02:12:59,159 --> 02:13:02,609
We got the sentry, technically speaking.

2055
02:13:02,609 --> 02:13:04,729
Actually a net win, that's true.

2056
02:13:04,729 --> 02:13:06,369
Yeah, look, we're doing it.

2057
02:13:06,369 --> 02:13:11,670
Oh shit, that's actually true, nice.

2058
02:13:11,670 --> 02:13:14,979
Oh shit, it actually did work.

2059
02:13:14,979 --> 02:13:19,000
We just inspired everybody.

2060
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,800
Holy shit, the whole clip just went into somebody.

2061
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:36,460
I just freaked somebody out so bad.

2062
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,859
Smash, smash.

2063
02:13:37,859 --> 02:13:40,579
I was ever saying minus four.

2064
02:13:40,579 --> 02:13:44,100
Whoa, you must've told a really bad joke.

2065
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,500
I've never even seen a minus four before.

2066
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:49,369
What happened?

2067
02:13:49,369 --> 02:13:50,569
No, did you guys hear the,

2068
02:13:52,569 --> 02:13:58,489
it just wasn't on screen, I looked away.

2069
02:13:58,489 --> 02:14:01,729
I am not dying over there.

2070
02:14:01,729 --> 02:14:04,170
Whoa, Chris Krieg.

2071
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,449
Whoa, what is going on?

2072
02:14:06,449 --> 02:14:08,170
Okay, so when you were giving me shit for like,

2073
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:09,810
how come you're not screaming every time you die?

2074
02:14:09,810 --> 02:14:11,449
But when I say, whoa, Chris Krieg,

2075
02:14:11,449 --> 02:14:13,489
that's for you to make a little joke.

2076
02:14:13,489 --> 02:14:16,449
That's not a death noise, it's very different.

2077
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:19,810
We're being stupid down here.

2078
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:22,369
Turn around, turn around, turn around.

2079
02:14:22,369 --> 02:14:28,229
You stopped healing me.

2080
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:29,149
That would've been so cool,

2081
02:14:29,149 --> 02:14:39,649
everyone would've thought I was cool if I did that.

2082
02:14:39,649 --> 02:14:41,770
Somebody said, this feels like a bit.

2083
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:44,050
I think it's because me and Ster have not played this game

2084
02:14:44,050 --> 02:14:47,180
for 10 fucking years on camera.

2085
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:48,020
I think that's probably why you feel that way.

2086
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:49,739
We're playing separate games as well.

2087
02:14:49,739 --> 02:14:51,460
I feel like we're doing entirely

2088
02:14:51,460 --> 02:14:52,699
and completely different things

2089
02:14:52,699 --> 02:14:57,310
like we're in two different games.

2090
02:14:57,310 --> 02:14:58,630
I think we're doing fine though.

2091
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:00,989
I got put into the ceiling.

2092
02:15:00,989 --> 02:15:09,829
I mean.

2093
02:15:09,829 --> 02:15:12,229
Oh, come on.

2094
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:17,390
Did that really just happen?

2095
02:15:17,390 --> 02:15:22,350
Somebody shoot something, for goodness gracious.

2096
02:15:22,350 --> 02:15:23,590
We need the Uber.

2097
02:15:23,590 --> 02:15:29,819
I just have to try to stay alive longer.

2098
02:15:29,819 --> 02:15:32,119
Medic, wanna build Uber?

2099
02:15:32,119 --> 02:15:33,199
I'm coming.

2100
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:42,640
Medic, can only run so fast, bro.

2101
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:45,840
Oh, here, I'm charging, I'm building Uber for you.

2102
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:50,600
You want me to play a class that gets Ubered?

2103
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:52,319
Or do you wanna roll the dice?

2104
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:55,399
I got this is direct hit soldier up here.

2105
02:15:55,399 --> 02:15:59,039
I think I'm all right.

2106
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:01,119
This demo up here too, I think we'll be okay.

2107
02:16:01,119 --> 02:16:04,840
Oh, I almost got it.

2108
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:06,600
Do not as a sniper, I'm gonna get hit in the head

2109
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:13,079
if I show my face.

2110
02:16:13,079 --> 02:16:14,520
Every time I see a heavy,

2111
02:16:14,520 --> 02:16:17,560
they are seconds away from being backstabbed.

2112
02:16:17,560 --> 02:16:20,140
I need to heal, I gotta heal.

2113
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:22,539
All right, I'm ready to Uber this soldier

2114
02:16:22,539 --> 02:16:27,050
if they're still alive up here.

2115
02:16:27,050 --> 02:16:27,890
Fuck.

2116
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:29,090
Oh my God, dude.

2117
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:31,630
I thought he killed them.

2118
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,989
See, he had like the pan kill

2119
02:16:32,989 --> 02:16:36,110
and I was like, oh, he killed the guy.

2120
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:37,229
I didn't know there was like three people

2121
02:16:37,229 --> 02:16:40,290
in the fucking corner.

2122
02:16:40,290 --> 02:16:46,540
No, I'm bad.

2123
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,459
I saw the crit pan kill and I was like,

2124
02:16:48,459 --> 02:16:52,159
oh, nice, you got him.

2125
02:16:52,159 --> 02:17:00,600
Fuck.

2126
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:01,440
Somebody up here now.

2127
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,620
All right, get me out of the way.

2128
02:17:06,620 --> 02:17:08,459
We're going to push an Uber in.

2129
02:17:08,459 --> 02:17:10,219
We will eventually.

2130
02:17:10,219 --> 02:17:15,110
They just crits our front line.

2131
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:16,629
Our front line is down.

2132
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:30,280
Oh my goodness.

2133
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:31,920
Oh heavy, peek this corner.

2134
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:36,899
Not you.

2135
02:17:37,819 --> 02:17:39,920
You got dominated.

2136
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,440
Yeah, the guy was behind us.

2137
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:44,840
He didn't, I didn't, I did.

2138
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:46,399
There was nobody there and then I turned around again.

2139
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:49,000
There's a rocket in my face.

2140
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,219
Medic, we need you.

2141
02:17:51,219 --> 02:17:52,700
Well, you need to keep the medic alive

2142
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:53,540
and no one's doing that.

2143
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:54,540
You keep going on the flank.

2144
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:55,979
You're like down in the basement.

2145
02:17:55,979 --> 02:17:57,860
No, you follow where the medic goes.

2146
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:58,979
Medic is the quarterback of Team Fortress.

2147
02:17:58,979 --> 02:18:00,500
I haven't seen you.

2148
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,459
Well, you're playing sniper.

2149
02:18:02,459 --> 02:18:05,079
Can you heal me?

2150
02:18:05,079 --> 02:18:07,200
I'm the only medic on the goddamn team right now.

2151
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,040
All right.

2152
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:08,879
You're right next to me.

2153
02:18:09,639 --> 02:18:11,639
Look at how many, who takes priority?

2154
02:18:11,639 --> 02:18:15,719
Heavy or sniper?

2155
02:18:15,719 --> 02:18:16,760
Who takes priority?

2156
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:18,000
You weren't healing him.

2157
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:18,840
I was.

2158
02:18:24,209 --> 02:18:25,489
Oh no, you go get a health back.

2159
02:18:25,489 --> 02:18:27,170
Blue bow is gonna carry again.

2160
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:31,329
Oh God, he's dead.

2161
02:18:31,329 --> 02:18:32,149
I got an Uber right now.

2162
02:18:32,149 --> 02:18:32,989
I got an Uber right now.

2163
02:18:32,989 --> 02:18:33,829
Go, go, go, go, go.

2164
02:18:33,829 --> 02:18:34,649
Jump through, jump through.

2165
02:18:34,649 --> 02:18:35,489
We're going, going, going.

2166
02:18:35,489 --> 02:18:36,770
Go, go, go.

2167
02:18:36,770 --> 02:18:39,850
Get in there, go.

2168
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:46,309
Don't touch it.

2169
02:18:46,309 --> 02:18:50,360
What, what, what?

2170
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:51,200
It's chaos.

2171
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,020
Go, go, go, go, go.

2172
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:52,860
Chaos, chaos.

2173
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:55,639
It's chaos time.

2174
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:58,030
You guys gotta get this.

2175
02:18:58,030 --> 02:19:01,680
Failure, failure, failure.

2176
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:02,840
Leave.

2177
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,260
You gotta leave now.

2178
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:05,680
You're embarrassing me.

2179
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,000
Wait, is there another round?

2180
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,840
I left, I left.

2181
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:14,809
Minus four?

2182
02:19:14,809 --> 02:19:16,340
What?

2183
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:18,229
I got minus four.

2184
02:19:18,229 --> 02:19:20,440
I don't know why, why are people saying that?

2185
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:24,040
What does that mean?

2186
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:29,610
I think it means, I don't know.

2187
02:19:29,610 --> 02:19:33,219
What did I eat four of today?

2188
02:19:33,219 --> 02:19:35,219
If you want to see just how far

2189
02:19:35,219 --> 02:19:37,680
my gamer skill has fallen.

2190
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:41,930
I got 52 points of the spy in one life.

2191
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:48,180
I got like 60, but that's not ever gonna happen ever again.

2192
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,690
Oh, this is one of the new ones.

2193
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:54,420
You can definitely just go onto your walkway again

2194
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:57,540
to get that the same way you got it the first time.

2195
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:58,379
No, no, no.

2196
02:19:58,379 --> 02:20:00,860
I was very careful to make sure I didn't do that.

2197
02:20:00,860 --> 02:20:03,389
Cause I always wanted that to be accurate.

2198
02:20:03,389 --> 02:20:05,389
Cause when it happened, it was like, holy shit.

2199
02:20:05,389 --> 02:20:09,770
And now you want to preserve it for life.

2200
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:16,940
Oh, I'm going to do, I'm going to go heavy with

2201
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:18,659
maybe just default minigun.

2202
02:20:24,729 --> 02:20:27,440
I like the chocolate bar.

2203
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,799
And we'll do gloves.

2204
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:32,180
I like the chocolate bar.

2205
02:20:32,180 --> 02:20:34,950
This thing is cool, but it's kind of distracting.

2206
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:36,389
You got a banana?

2207
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:38,670
I do, but chocolate's kind of fun

2208
02:20:38,670 --> 02:20:41,989
because it gives you more max health.

2209
02:20:41,989 --> 02:20:45,399
But banana got potassium.

2210
02:20:45,399 --> 02:20:46,360
Bananas are great.

2211
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:52,399
I have no idea where I'm going.

2212
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:53,899
I think I'm going the right way.

2213
02:20:53,899 --> 02:20:55,700
There's arrows.

2214
02:20:55,700 --> 02:21:02,930
Yeah, I bit my tongue a little bit.

2215
02:21:02,930 --> 02:21:04,659
All right, let's do it.

2216
02:21:04,659 --> 02:21:07,979
I bit my tongue.

2217
02:21:07,979 --> 02:21:10,100
Oh, they come out this way?

2218
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:19,120
Cool.

2219
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:22,569
Is there a spy?

2220
02:21:22,569 --> 02:21:27,010
Why do I feel like there's not very many people?

2221
02:21:27,010 --> 02:21:28,610
Because they're cowards and they all died

2222
02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:30,690
and they need to respawn and respawns take a while.

2223
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:32,250
I even turned around.

2224
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:34,170
I turned around looking for a spy

2225
02:21:34,170 --> 02:21:36,250
and that second I turned my back, I'm dead.

2226
02:21:36,250 --> 02:21:38,250
There's a spy coming.

2227
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:41,629
Spy dead ringer, spy dead ringer.

2228
02:21:41,629 --> 02:21:45,520
Pirate spy, pirate spy.

2229
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,200
Let's do the fucking slowed down

2230
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:50,069
instrumental version of that.

2231
02:21:50,069 --> 02:21:55,250
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

2232
02:21:55,450 --> 02:21:58,940
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

2233
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:03,040
You just did the brown noise to me.

2234
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,639
That was so Basie.

2235
02:22:05,639 --> 02:22:06,479
It really wasn't.

2236
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:10,840
I mean, my pants tell a different story.

2237
02:22:13,540 --> 02:22:14,579
All right.

2238
02:22:14,579 --> 02:22:15,979
Honest to goodness, honest to goodness.

2239
02:22:15,979 --> 02:22:17,459
What the fuck just happened there?

2240
02:22:17,459 --> 02:22:18,299
What happened?

2241
02:22:18,299 --> 02:22:35,190
I haven't got to run all the way back there.

2242
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:36,729
A lot of spies.

2243
02:22:36,729 --> 02:22:41,700
There are, I get there, turn around to look for a spy,

2244
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:47,540
freak out for a second, spin my mini gun and die.

2245
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:51,379
Their team may have like four or five of them.

2246
02:22:51,379 --> 02:22:52,379
I fucking knew it.

2247
02:22:52,379 --> 02:22:53,379
I knew it.

2248
02:22:53,379 --> 02:22:54,379
He might not even be dead.

2249
02:22:54,379 --> 02:23:14,250
Yeah.

2250
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:25,090
There's one behind.

2251
02:23:25,090 --> 02:23:26,090
Sure is.

2252
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:27,090
It's in my head.

2253
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:29,389
I got 400 fucking health.

2254
02:23:29,389 --> 02:23:34,340
Yeah.

2255
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:36,100
Oh shit.

2256
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:42,139
Can someone do the spy math?

2257
02:23:42,139 --> 02:23:43,139
How many Ubers do they have?

2258
02:23:43,139 --> 02:23:46,879
Shit.

2259
02:23:46,879 --> 02:23:49,959
It's, it's, it's, this has to come down to like 1.2.

2260
02:23:49,959 --> 02:23:58,969
It's way too high still.

2261
02:23:58,969 --> 02:24:01,299
Even lower.

2262
02:24:01,299 --> 02:24:02,299
This has got to be like 1.1?

2263
02:24:02,299 --> 02:24:03,299
1. like 1.5?

2264
02:24:03,299 --> 02:24:04,299
Do it!

2265
02:24:05,219 --> 02:24:07,479
Do it!

2266
02:24:07,479 --> 02:24:08,479
Get it right!

2267
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:11,299
That's better, I think.

2268
02:24:11,299 --> 02:24:17,340
Turn off the mouse.

2269
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:20,569
The mouse acceleration is on.

2270
02:24:20,569 --> 02:24:29,549
It's off.

2271
02:24:29,549 --> 02:24:36,379
I feel the love of God.

2272
02:24:36,379 --> 02:24:37,620
Okay.

2273
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:38,860
He's here.

2274
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:39,860
He ain't dead.

2275
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:44,049
Wow.

2276
02:24:44,049 --> 02:24:45,049
Wow.

2277
02:24:45,049 --> 02:24:47,010
Did the heavy appear behind me?

2278
02:24:47,010 --> 02:24:52,680
Ain't nobody killing me with a backstab now.

2279
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:53,680
My whole team's there.

2280
02:24:53,680 --> 02:25:05,620
I don't want to be that pyro guy.

2281
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:07,620
There's just too many species.

2282
02:25:10,260 --> 02:25:13,260
Can we get a director's cut of the speed video?

2283
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:14,260
Like what you were thinking.

2284
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:16,260
Like a whole walkthrough.

2285
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:18,819
A whole walkthrough?

2286
02:25:18,819 --> 02:25:22,219
Yeah, you can like slow it down and point stuff out that like maybe like you don't notice

2287
02:25:22,219 --> 02:25:24,790
on your first watch.

2288
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:25,790
That spy is not.

2289
02:25:25,790 --> 02:25:26,790
Oh my gosh.

2290
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:44,100
I need ammo.

2291
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:50,139
Dude, he's too good.

2292
02:25:50,139 --> 02:25:56,819
Ready to go.

2293
02:25:56,819 --> 02:25:57,819
He's not dead.

2294
02:25:57,819 --> 02:26:01,420
He's absolutely 100% still life.

2295
02:26:01,420 --> 02:26:02,420
Don't do it!

2296
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:03,420
I thought I was part of a way.

2297
02:26:03,420 --> 02:26:14,200
Oh my.

2298
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,200
Wait.

2299
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:19,059
What?

2300
02:26:19,059 --> 02:26:20,059
Was it the pyro?

2301
02:26:20,059 --> 02:26:21,059
No, the pyro sprayed me.

2302
02:26:21,059 --> 02:26:22,059
The pyro sprayed me.

2303
02:26:22,139 --> 02:26:25,729
The pyro sprayed.

2304
02:26:25,729 --> 02:26:30,040
Jesus.

2305
02:26:30,040 --> 02:26:31,659
Gee whiz.

2306
02:26:31,659 --> 02:26:32,659
It was the scout.

2307
02:26:32,659 --> 02:26:37,659
Oh, he jumped up on the rock.

2308
02:26:37,659 --> 02:26:38,659
Oh, that bastard.

2309
02:26:38,659 --> 02:26:41,899
You played with the Dragon's Fury?

2310
02:26:41,899 --> 02:26:44,899
That's the new pyro one, right?

2311
02:26:44,899 --> 02:26:46,899
The pyro flamethrower.

2312
02:26:46,899 --> 02:26:50,899
I looked at it, but I never really actually tried to use it.

2313
02:26:50,899 --> 02:26:53,459
I've been enjoying it.

2314
02:26:53,459 --> 02:26:59,899
I'm a Dragon's Fury appreciator.

2315
02:26:59,899 --> 02:27:08,299
Come on.

2316
02:27:08,299 --> 02:27:12,680
Play scout.

2317
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:13,760
Play scout.

2318
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:23,450
Okay.

2319
02:27:23,450 --> 02:27:24,450
Fine.

2320
02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:25,450
It's a flare gun primary.

2321
02:27:25,450 --> 02:27:28,420
Yeah.

2322
02:27:28,420 --> 02:27:30,180
You don't actually hold a fire down.

2323
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:51,690
It's like a weird like projectile in it and your face came on.

2324
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:52,690
I'll turn my face.

2325
02:27:52,690 --> 02:28:01,180
Come on for exactly 10 minutes next round and I'll make sure to say now we're doing

2326
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:02,180
it.

2327
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:03,680
Now we're doing it.

2328
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,680
Oh my God.

2329
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:05,680
Jerma kind of looks like the scout.

2330
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:33,409
Are you full of shit?

2331
02:28:33,409 --> 02:28:34,409
You real?

2332
02:28:34,409 --> 02:28:35,409
All right.

2333
02:28:35,409 --> 02:28:36,780
Wait, wait.

2334
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:37,780
Hold on.

2335
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:39,899
Do you kind of look like the scout because you played this game growing up?

2336
02:28:39,899 --> 02:28:40,899
What?

2337
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:42,620
Do you just like mold it your life around it?

2338
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:45,879
Is that kind of cringe?

2339
02:28:45,879 --> 02:28:46,879
What are you talking about?

2340
02:28:46,879 --> 02:28:49,979
Oh, look.

2341
02:28:49,979 --> 02:28:50,979
Oh, TF2.

2342
02:28:50,979 --> 02:28:51,979
I love TF2.

2343
02:28:51,979 --> 02:28:54,879
Like I'm going to like look like the scout now.

2344
02:28:54,879 --> 02:28:55,879
Oh my goodness.

2345
02:28:55,879 --> 02:28:58,440
I just I don't know where to go.

2346
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:00,200
I think I have to go back here.

2347
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:01,200
I don't know the route.

2348
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:04,200
It is impossible to talk to you right now, by the way, dude.

2349
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:09,200
We're playing separate games and everything I say is just like, wait, wait, wait, okay.

2350
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,200
Like you're so involved in the game and you're so interested about what's going on.

2351
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,840
I've kind of just given up.

2352
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:15,840
All right.

2353
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:16,840
What did you just ask?

2354
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:17,840
Say it again.

2355
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:18,840
It's no way.

2356
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:19,840
It doesn't matter.

2357
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:23,440
You asked me if I played with the pyro new primary and I was like, oh, it looks cool.

2358
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:24,440
No, no, no, no, no.

2359
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:25,840
I am answering your questions.

2360
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,920
I'm just like stuff is happening in the middle.

2361
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,840
You're answering them if in that exact moment you have like three seconds of attention span

2362
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,239
to give me your one word answer because I am 80, 80, 80, 80, 80.

2363
02:29:36,239 --> 02:29:37,239
Oh my God.

2364
02:29:37,239 --> 02:29:38,239
This guy's fucking watching the screen.

2365
02:29:38,239 --> 02:29:43,840
You didn't even finish that bit.

2366
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
I've changed, dude.

2367
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I keep getting killed.

2368
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
All right.

2369
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,200
What?

2370
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,200
Let's start over.

2371
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,200
What did you say?

2372
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:54,969
I have nothing left.

2373
02:29:54,969 --> 02:29:55,969
I said it all.

2374
02:29:55,969 --> 02:29:56,969
It's all been said.

2375
02:29:56,969 --> 02:30:02,940
It's all on record.

2376
02:30:02,940 --> 02:30:03,940
Sorry.

2377
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:04,940
This game requires a lot of attention.

2378
02:30:04,940 --> 02:30:06,250
Does it?

2379
02:30:06,250 --> 02:30:07,250
Yeah.

2380
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:09,000
When you're playing scout.

2381
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Yeah.

2382
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,309
Did you hit the meat shot?

2383
02:30:15,309 --> 02:30:20,870
Uh, eight, eight D meat, meat shot.

2384
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:21,870
80, 80.

2385
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:22,870
Wait, no, no.

2386
02:30:22,870 --> 02:30:23,870
Eight smiley.

2387
02:30:24,430 --> 02:30:28,100
That was very loud.

2388
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:30,860
Uh, turn your face cam on.

2389
02:30:30,860 --> 02:30:32,930
Okay.

2390
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:33,930
Fine.

2391
02:30:33,930 --> 02:30:34,930
Hi, everybody.

2392
02:30:34,930 --> 02:30:35,930
Well, I'm like really zoomed in.

2393
02:30:35,930 --> 02:30:37,739
Oops.

2394
02:30:37,739 --> 02:30:38,739
I don't care.

2395
02:30:38,739 --> 02:30:42,670
All right.

2396
02:30:42,670 --> 02:30:43,670
You get, you get face cam for one round and it's gone forever.

2397
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:49,059
You got long hair.

2398
02:30:49,059 --> 02:30:50,180
I told you I was just growing it out.

2399
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,540
I'm going to just grow it as long as it can go.

2400
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:52,540
I'm going to be as gross as possible.

2401
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:59,540
All right.

2402
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:02,540
You guys get face cam for one round, but mine's like bigger than his is.

2403
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:04,420
It's fine.

2404
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:08,989
Should I reset?

2405
02:31:08,989 --> 02:31:09,989
Hold on.

2406
02:31:09,989 --> 02:31:11,229
Let me resize it.

2407
02:31:11,229 --> 02:31:16,059
Wait, hold on.

2408
02:31:16,059 --> 02:31:17,059
Are you making yours bigger?

2409
02:31:17,059 --> 02:31:22,219
I just made it like 10% bigger.

2410
02:31:22,700 --> 02:31:26,620
It's free points.

2411
02:31:26,620 --> 02:31:27,620
That's free points.

2412
02:31:27,620 --> 02:31:41,090
I'll take it.

2413
02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:42,090
I actually really like this thing.

2414
02:31:42,090 --> 02:31:43,090
I never use it though.

2415
02:31:43,090 --> 02:31:46,819
Oops.

2416
02:31:46,819 --> 02:31:49,340
Camera's too high.

2417
02:31:49,340 --> 02:31:51,610
Camera's too high?

2418
02:31:51,610 --> 02:31:59,010
Uh, hey, I don't, I'm not, it's fine.

2419
02:31:59,010 --> 02:32:01,309
Yeah, I think mine's good.

2420
02:32:01,309 --> 02:32:05,959
Is yours like half the screen or something?

2421
02:32:05,959 --> 02:32:08,959
Well, no, you, I'm trying to copy what, yours is too high, mine's too high.

2422
02:32:08,959 --> 02:32:10,959
Like you think you're a special kid?

2423
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:12,959
Thinking like, like cool joke, like nice fit.

2424
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:15,959
Like, oh, it's so hard to like make your webcam too high.

2425
02:32:15,959 --> 02:32:16,959
Like funny.

2426
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:31,229
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2427
02:32:31,709 --> 02:32:35,379
Oops.

2428
02:32:35,379 --> 02:32:39,069
My face cam is going to stay the way it is.

2429
02:32:39,069 --> 02:32:40,629
Okay.

2430
02:32:40,629 --> 02:32:43,899
People say my chin's cut off.

2431
02:32:43,899 --> 02:32:44,899
It's fine.

2432
02:32:44,899 --> 02:32:48,500
It's because the camera.

2433
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:49,500
You cut your chin off?

2434
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:52,870
My, the camera's, I'll fix it in like a month.

2435
02:32:52,870 --> 02:33:00,530
There's a whole point of a face cam to show your face.

2436
02:33:00,530 --> 02:33:02,659
How long have you been streaming?

2437
02:33:02,659 --> 02:33:03,659
How many years?

2438
02:33:03,659 --> 02:33:07,799
I don't even, I don't even understand how this person keeps finding me.

2439
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:11,319
There's like an eight second delay.

2440
02:33:11,319 --> 02:33:23,700
All right.

2441
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,700
I'm going fucking psycho mode now.

2442
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:27,510
Oh yeah.

2443
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:28,510
You know, here it comes now.

2444
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:29,510
Same.

2445
02:33:29,989 --> 02:33:31,989
You want to do double flog Pyro?

2446
02:33:31,989 --> 02:33:33,989
Ah, I'm Dragon's Fury.

2447
02:33:33,989 --> 02:33:36,989
I'm a Dragon's Fury enjoyer.

2448
02:33:36,989 --> 02:33:49,940
Oh my.

2449
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:52,940
Oh, nice spy checking Pyro.

2450
02:33:52,940 --> 02:34:08,770
I flew the fire on every single person.

2451
02:34:08,770 --> 02:34:10,770
I wish they would make fall damage happen.

2452
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:20,979
Just like, just like three feet higher or lower or you know what I'm saying.

2453
02:34:20,979 --> 02:34:22,979
That's a backstab right there.

2454
02:34:22,979 --> 02:34:35,059
There's my face.

2455
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:37,729
Help.

2456
02:34:37,729 --> 02:34:39,159
Help.

2457
02:34:39,159 --> 02:34:40,159
Where'd the medic go?

2458
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:43,059
Ouch.

2459
02:34:43,059 --> 02:34:44,059
Whoa.

2460
02:34:44,059 --> 02:34:45,059
Where?

2461
02:34:45,059 --> 02:34:47,780
From where?

2462
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:58,809
He did it.

2463
02:34:58,809 --> 02:35:08,430
That was good.

2464
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:09,860
We're good.

2465
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:12,059
Hmm.

2466
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:22,840
Sniper, they're coming.

2467
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:28,969
How does he stay alive with 16 health?

2468
02:35:28,969 --> 02:35:30,969
Because he had 16 health.

2469
02:35:30,969 --> 02:35:45,680
Sometimes I forget that the fire projectiles like can kind of, you have to like move him

2470
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:46,680
around.

2471
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:49,680
Like they're like almost like delayed if you've tried to track somebody.

2472
02:35:53,729 --> 02:36:00,430
Are you serious?

2473
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:04,799
Yeah, sometimes it's like it's hard to get it like directly on their body if they're

2474
02:36:04,799 --> 02:36:06,799
scraping around sometimes.

2475
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:14,389
That's Mei from Overwatch.

2476
02:36:14,389 --> 02:36:15,389
Bye.

2477
02:36:15,389 --> 02:36:20,600
I heard it.

2478
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:22,600
You are full of shit, Scout.

2479
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:26,590
He's right.

2480
02:36:26,590 --> 02:36:27,590
They changed Pyro.

2481
02:36:27,590 --> 02:36:34,290
They changed all the flamethrowers work?

2482
02:36:34,290 --> 02:36:35,290
What?

2483
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:40,299
Yeah, it's like you have to, the flame is its own like weird projectile that moves like

2484
02:36:40,299 --> 02:36:41,790
trails.

2485
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:44,969
Oh, well I only use the Dragon's Fury.

2486
02:36:45,450 --> 02:36:47,450
Because I'm a gigantic.

2487
02:36:47,450 --> 02:36:54,299
I'm going to put the shotgun on.

2488
02:36:54,299 --> 02:36:58,200
Let's go shotgun time.

2489
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:02,079
I should play with the degreaser, but I don't care.

2490
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:03,079
Your audio got cut off, by the way.

2491
02:37:03,079 --> 02:37:05,079
We didn't hear the cool song.

2492
02:37:05,079 --> 02:37:18,989
Oh, we're doing a plenty hairstyle today.

2493
02:37:18,989 --> 02:37:20,989
Um, I don't think so.

2494
02:37:20,989 --> 02:37:36,329
I hit him with like almost every shot from a shotgun.

2495
02:37:36,329 --> 02:37:52,500
Just killed a hamster.

2496
02:37:52,500 --> 02:38:02,100
I don't believe that he's dead.

2497
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:27,620
Oh, God.

2498
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:32,100
The spy has almost a hundred points, by the way.

2499
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:33,100
A hundred?

2500
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:38,860
Yeah, because they feel bad for the spy and they give them all those points.

2501
02:38:38,860 --> 02:38:46,299
Don't you know that one spy backstab is like 30 points?

2502
02:38:46,299 --> 02:38:49,299
Ever since they nerfed the dead ringer, they're like, oh, I guess it's even harder now.

2503
02:38:49,299 --> 02:38:52,299
I think it's like 40 points for backstab.

2504
02:38:52,299 --> 02:38:58,870
The next person on the team has 38 points.

2505
02:38:58,870 --> 02:39:06,139
That's freaking ludicrous, dude.

2506
02:39:06,139 --> 02:39:07,139
I explained it.

2507
02:39:07,139 --> 02:39:08,450
I know.

2508
02:39:08,450 --> 02:39:09,450
Can someone push the cart?

2509
02:39:09,450 --> 02:39:10,450
I'm going to try to get on it.

2510
02:39:10,930 --> 02:39:13,930
I've noticed this is one of those maps where no one touches the cart at the end here because

2511
02:39:13,930 --> 02:39:23,059
they think someone's going to stop them and then they don't.

2512
02:39:23,059 --> 02:39:25,190
See?

2513
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:26,190
Sniper is back.

2514
02:39:26,190 --> 02:39:27,190
That just happened.

2515
02:39:27,190 --> 02:39:28,190
That's two for two right there.

2516
02:39:28,190 --> 02:39:31,930
Ow.

2517
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:36,649
Spy check mania?

2518
02:39:36,649 --> 02:39:37,649
Kind of what I'm doing right now.

2519
02:39:37,649 --> 02:40:12,100
It's the only thing I can do.

2520
02:40:12,100 --> 02:40:20,190
Alright, we're on it.

2521
02:40:20,190 --> 02:40:23,190
He still killed me.

2522
02:40:23,190 --> 02:40:26,190
This thing sucks, doesn't it?

2523
02:40:26,190 --> 02:40:28,190
Should I use this thing?

2524
02:40:28,190 --> 02:40:36,059
I'm just going to rig the fire axe.

2525
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:43,739
I feel like the sound effect was even like lower.

2526
02:40:43,739 --> 02:41:10,659
It's like a...

2527
02:41:10,659 --> 02:41:14,780
Oh, fuck.

2528
02:41:14,780 --> 02:41:22,139
Fire axe is even worse.

2529
02:41:22,139 --> 02:41:24,139
I got to read all the items again.

2530
02:41:24,139 --> 02:41:27,139
Everything seems to be changed so differently.

2531
02:41:27,139 --> 02:41:28,139
That's cool though.

2532
02:41:28,139 --> 02:41:29,139
I'm happy about it.

2533
02:41:29,139 --> 02:41:36,290
It's like a whole other game to explore.

2534
02:41:36,290 --> 02:41:39,700
That's cool.

2535
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:40,700
You got to read them first.

2536
02:41:40,700 --> 02:41:45,030
Why was that guy just a hundred miles per hour?

2537
02:41:45,030 --> 02:41:46,030
That was weird.

2538
02:41:46,030 --> 02:42:00,260
Dude, is he still alive?

2539
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:01,260
What the fuck?

2540
02:42:01,260 --> 02:42:06,409
He is still alive.

2541
02:42:06,889 --> 02:42:13,799
That's a difference in bio.

2542
02:42:13,799 --> 02:42:18,280
I thought it was the same guy.

2543
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:21,219
Why is that Pyro there?

2544
02:42:21,219 --> 02:42:22,219
It's not me.

2545
02:42:22,219 --> 02:42:24,219
It's me.

2546
02:42:24,219 --> 02:42:25,219
Literally me.

2547
02:42:25,219 --> 02:42:29,260
Did he not light on fire?

2548
02:42:29,260 --> 02:42:30,260
What was that?

2549
02:42:30,260 --> 02:42:37,770
I think he's dead.

2550
02:42:37,770 --> 02:42:56,479
No.

2551
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:57,479
No.

2552
02:42:57,479 --> 02:42:58,479
He's still alive.

2553
02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:04,739
Dude, does the dead ringer make you not get hit by fire or something?

2554
02:43:04,739 --> 02:43:05,739
How come I couldn't do it?

2555
02:43:05,739 --> 02:43:08,739
It does extinguish you and then you have to light them on fire again.

2556
02:43:08,739 --> 02:43:10,920
If I'm not mistaken.

2557
02:43:11,399 --> 02:43:13,639
Because I felt like he died and then was invisible.

2558
02:43:13,639 --> 02:43:15,639
I lit him on fire and then it went off of him.

2559
02:43:15,639 --> 02:43:16,639
Spicycle?

2560
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:19,639
You could also use the Spicycle, but that makes a noise.

2561
02:43:19,639 --> 02:43:20,639
Oh, right.

2562
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:21,639
Okay.

2563
02:43:21,639 --> 02:43:28,489
It melts the Spicycle though, right?

2564
02:43:28,489 --> 02:43:29,489
At the same time?

2565
02:43:29,489 --> 02:43:30,489
Yep.

2566
02:43:30,489 --> 02:43:43,440
It does.

2567
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:44,440
That was a good fucking shot.

2568
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:45,440
Jesus.

2569
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:47,440
It literally was falling down.

2570
02:43:47,440 --> 02:44:05,700
It's me.

2571
02:44:05,700 --> 02:44:07,579
I promise.

2572
02:44:07,579 --> 02:44:08,579
Okay.

2573
02:44:08,579 --> 02:44:09,579
The enemy team is like right up here.

2574
02:44:09,579 --> 02:44:11,579
There's a health kit, but they're going to look at you because this is their spawn.

2575
02:44:11,579 --> 02:44:15,809
Did you get the health kit?

2576
02:44:15,809 --> 02:44:18,690
I'm not there.

2577
02:44:19,170 --> 02:44:22,049
I think that's a spy you're looking at.

2578
02:44:22,049 --> 02:44:24,219
That's not your name.

2579
02:44:24,219 --> 02:44:25,219
It wasn't.

2580
02:44:25,219 --> 02:44:26,219
No, it was an engineer with me.

2581
02:44:26,219 --> 02:44:28,219
And then you look straight at my face and said, this is me.

2582
02:44:28,219 --> 02:44:29,219
I promise.

2583
02:44:29,219 --> 02:44:31,219
And I fucking believed you.

2584
02:44:31,219 --> 02:44:32,219
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2585
02:44:32,219 --> 02:44:33,219
You're an engineer.

2586
02:44:33,219 --> 02:44:34,219
I'm a pyro.

2587
02:44:34,219 --> 02:44:35,219
Oh, wait.

2588
02:44:35,219 --> 02:44:40,500
What?

2589
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:44,000
There was an engineer in the side room with a sentry and I walked up to him and I was

2590
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:45,000
like, oh shit.

2591
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
And he was shooting me.

2592
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
He thought I was a spy.

2593
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
So I was like, I'm real.

2594
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Were you in the middle of also a separate, but I was a pyro and like a damaged engineer

2595
02:44:53,079 --> 02:44:56,079
was walking around the corner and he stopped and stared at me as you said that.

2596
02:44:56,079 --> 02:44:59,079
And it was like, don't like, you're like, oh, don't worry.

2597
02:44:59,079 --> 02:45:00,079
It's me.

2598
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:01,079
And I was like, oh, cool.

2599
02:45:01,079 --> 02:45:02,379
It's you.

2600
02:45:02,379 --> 02:45:04,379
Were they, were they good enough for his webcam time over?

2601
02:45:04,379 --> 02:45:05,379
They're being good.

2602
02:45:05,379 --> 02:45:09,319
I keep it on another round chat was bad.

2603
02:45:09,319 --> 02:45:10,319
Were they bad?

2604
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:12,319
My chat was being very bad.

2605
02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:16,639
What the heck is going on here, guys?

2606
02:45:16,639 --> 02:45:18,639
All right.

2607
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:20,590
Fine.

2608
02:45:20,590 --> 02:45:21,590
I'll do it too.

2609
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:23,719
Is there enough time for me to pee?

2610
02:45:23,719 --> 02:45:25,280
Oh, yeah.

2611
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:26,280
Let's all pee.

2612
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:28,280
Let's actually leave the game.

2613
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:29,360
Okay.

2614
02:45:29,360 --> 02:45:30,360
And let's do a little pee break.

2615
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:34,040
Okay.

2616
02:45:34,040 --> 02:47:11,850
All right.

2617
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:12,850
We're back.

2618
02:47:12,850 --> 02:47:13,850
I am back.

2619
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:15,850
Are you also here?

2620
02:47:15,850 --> 02:47:17,920
How are you?

2621
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:20,250
How's it going?

2622
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:24,159
Oh, he's not here.

2623
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:28,020
That was quick.

2624
02:47:28,020 --> 02:47:29,450
Yeah.

2625
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:30,450
I mean, he's usually pretty quick.

2626
02:47:30,450 --> 02:47:35,250
So that's why I'm usually pretty slow.

2627
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:36,250
So I took my time.

2628
02:47:36,250 --> 02:47:37,250
That's what I mean.

2629
02:47:37,250 --> 02:47:38,250
I was trying to.

2630
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:39,250
You're usually pretty fast.

2631
02:47:39,250 --> 02:47:41,250
I was trying to match your time.

2632
02:47:41,250 --> 02:47:42,250
I'm like a fire hose.

2633
02:47:42,250 --> 02:47:44,639
He's seen it.

2634
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:47,290
Are you ready?

2635
02:47:47,290 --> 02:47:49,110
Wait, what?

2636
02:47:49,110 --> 02:47:50,110
All right.

2637
02:47:50,110 --> 02:47:51,110
Let's go.

2638
02:47:51,190 --> 02:47:58,000
I'm going to keep my face game on because they were good.

2639
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
They were good.

2640
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:00,000
That spy was very good.

2641
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Wait, did you mean good at the game or good in chat?

2642
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Probably both.

2643
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:13,440
Where's the game?

2644
02:48:13,440 --> 02:48:14,440
There it is.

2645
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:17,479
We're joining.

2646
02:48:17,479 --> 02:48:22,110
Very cool.

2647
02:48:22,110 --> 02:48:23,110
Epic.

2648
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:29,569
They were like three spies trying to kill you.

2649
02:48:29,569 --> 02:48:31,690
What's your most played time class?

2650
02:48:31,690 --> 02:48:32,690
So it is.

2651
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:33,690
It's fine.

2652
02:48:33,690 --> 02:48:34,690
I think it's spy.

2653
02:48:34,690 --> 02:48:35,690
Honestly.

2654
02:48:35,690 --> 02:48:39,680
Either spy or engineer.

2655
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:40,680
That was loud.

2656
02:48:40,680 --> 02:48:41,680
Is this the same one we were just in?

2657
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:42,680
I don't think so.

2658
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:44,840
No.

2659
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:45,840
No.

2660
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:53,860
I have a way better version of this.

2661
02:48:53,860 --> 02:48:58,000
Yeah, I got a factory new one of these things.

2662
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Let's put it on.

2663
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:02,010
Oh, there we go.

2664
02:49:02,010 --> 02:49:03,010
That's way better.

2665
02:49:03,010 --> 02:49:04,010
Getting a little spicy.

2666
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:05,010
It's a little.

2667
02:49:05,010 --> 02:49:24,360
I'm going to scout around town.

2668
02:49:24,360 --> 02:49:25,360
They're not.

2669
02:49:25,360 --> 02:49:26,360
Okay.

2670
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:27,530
He came.

2671
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:28,530
He became aware.

2672
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:29,530
He did the you strap on heavy.

2673
02:49:29,530 --> 02:49:31,290
You just pretend you're not there.

2674
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:32,290
You have a gibbous on.

2675
02:49:32,290 --> 02:49:33,530
You don't know what's going on.

2676
02:49:33,850 --> 02:49:34,850
And then you just awaken.

2677
02:49:47,149 --> 02:49:48,149
He's probably still alive.

2678
02:49:49,670 --> 02:49:50,670
Why are you doing that?

2679
02:49:50,670 --> 02:49:51,670
Why are you being weird?

2680
02:49:51,670 --> 02:49:52,670
Why are you being weird?

2681
02:49:52,670 --> 02:49:53,670
Me?

2682
02:49:53,670 --> 02:50:04,639
Spy.

2683
02:50:04,639 --> 02:50:05,639
You are.

2684
02:50:05,639 --> 02:50:06,639
There's no way.

2685
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:08,520
I'm sorry.

2686
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:13,790
You're alive still.

2687
02:50:13,790 --> 02:50:14,790
There's no way.

2688
02:50:14,790 --> 02:50:24,620
You know, I think you might be the most attractive streamer on this website.

2689
02:50:24,620 --> 02:50:25,620
Thank you.

2690
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:28,010
I guess.

2691
02:50:28,010 --> 02:50:29,010
Anyone else agree?

2692
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:32,659
It's not just me, right?

2693
02:50:32,659 --> 02:50:35,100
No, I don't know about that.

2694
02:50:39,770 --> 02:50:40,770
Well, like who else?

2695
02:50:40,770 --> 02:50:41,770
Who beats you?

2696
02:50:41,770 --> 02:50:43,780
I don't know.

2697
02:50:43,780 --> 02:50:48,600
Okay.

2698
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:49,600
That's why.

2699
02:50:49,600 --> 02:51:12,350
Nobody beats you.

2700
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:13,989
Ah, a nice movement heavy.

2701
02:51:13,989 --> 02:51:14,989
That was actually good.

2702
02:51:14,989 --> 02:51:17,829
Same guy.

2703
02:51:17,829 --> 02:51:18,829
I'll leave him alone.

2704
02:51:18,829 --> 02:51:19,829
He doesn't know what's going on.

2705
02:51:19,829 --> 02:51:20,829
I want him to enjoy the game.

2706
02:51:20,829 --> 02:51:25,440
I knew there was going to be a spy.

2707
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:29,479
You should have your ego inflated.

2708
02:51:29,479 --> 02:51:30,479
I don't.

2709
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:32,959
Look, I'm on a webcam.

2710
02:51:32,959 --> 02:51:33,959
That's like 480p.

2711
02:51:33,959 --> 02:51:36,959
Room is dark.

2712
02:51:36,959 --> 02:51:40,520
You look you look really good when I have to squint.

2713
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:43,209
But I don't.

2714
02:51:43,209 --> 02:51:48,920
The blurriness just adds to the mystique.

2715
02:51:48,920 --> 02:51:50,520
Well, I appreciate that.

2716
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:55,340
But I have what it that's a spy right there.

2717
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:58,530
There's a spy right here.

2718
02:51:58,530 --> 02:51:59,530
You can't get a better webcam.

2719
02:51:59,530 --> 02:52:03,969
I don't want a better webcam.

2720
02:52:03,969 --> 02:52:04,969
Why not?

2721
02:52:04,969 --> 02:52:08,809
Because then people will just see like you like my face.

2722
02:52:08,809 --> 02:52:09,809
Your pores.

2723
02:52:09,809 --> 02:52:10,809
Yeah, I don't want to look.

2724
02:52:10,809 --> 02:52:11,809
Oh, man.

2725
02:52:11,809 --> 02:52:12,809
It's in like 4K.

2726
02:52:12,809 --> 02:52:13,809
No, don't look at me.

2727
02:52:13,809 --> 02:52:14,809
Fuck off.

2728
02:52:14,809 --> 02:52:16,370
I don't want you to look at my 4K face.

2729
02:52:16,370 --> 02:52:17,370
Like who wants that?

2730
02:52:17,370 --> 02:52:18,370
I don't want that.

2731
02:52:18,370 --> 02:52:19,370
There's a lot of people.

2732
02:52:19,530 --> 02:52:20,530
Looking at your face right now.

2733
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:21,530
But it's like in 480p.

2734
02:52:21,530 --> 02:52:22,530
It's different.

2735
02:52:22,530 --> 02:52:25,049
That was weird.

2736
02:52:25,049 --> 02:52:31,860
Look at me.

2737
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:39,309
Well, we're doing it.

2738
02:52:39,309 --> 02:52:56,799
You ever heard of like a something called the responsibility of a 10?

2739
02:52:56,799 --> 02:53:02,250
I have no idea what you're going with on this.

2740
02:53:02,250 --> 02:53:11,790
It is your responsibility as a 10 out of 10 man to just reproduce and to give as many

2741
02:53:11,790 --> 02:53:14,750
people an opportunity to be with you as possible.

2742
02:53:19,670 --> 02:53:20,670
What the fuck?

2743
02:53:21,909 --> 02:53:28,670
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

2744
02:53:28,670 --> 02:53:30,270
That's so fucking insane.

2745
02:53:30,270 --> 02:53:33,629
I can't even play the game right now.

2746
02:53:33,629 --> 02:53:34,629
That was so fucked up.

2747
02:53:34,629 --> 02:53:35,629
I can't even fucking talk.

2748
02:53:35,629 --> 02:53:41,799
What do you mean?

2749
02:53:41,799 --> 02:53:45,709
I'm trying to snipe.

2750
02:53:45,709 --> 02:53:48,549
Do it.

2751
02:53:48,549 --> 02:53:51,350
I just heard that use.

2752
02:53:51,350 --> 02:54:03,709
That means it's a spy right here.

2753
02:54:03,709 --> 02:54:05,469
Oh, I see it now.

2754
02:54:05,469 --> 02:54:09,350
Oh, there's a secret sentry up there.

2755
02:54:09,629 --> 02:54:10,629
Oh, nose.

2756
02:54:10,629 --> 02:54:12,700
Oh, nose.

2757
02:54:12,700 --> 02:54:15,700
No, my nose was itchy.

2758
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:19,750
Oh, he's not dead.

2759
02:54:19,750 --> 02:54:20,750
He's not dead.

2760
02:54:20,750 --> 02:54:21,750
He's not dead.

2761
02:54:21,750 --> 02:54:28,239
He's coming for me again.

2762
02:54:28,239 --> 02:54:29,920
Oh, finally.

2763
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:33,229
Come on, make it happen.

2764
02:54:33,229 --> 02:54:36,870
Jeremy, you really need to make it happen.

2765
02:54:36,870 --> 02:54:44,059
He's going sicko mode with the Wrangler.

2766
02:54:44,059 --> 02:54:46,100
He actually kind of is.

2767
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:50,370
He's killing everybody.

2768
02:54:50,370 --> 02:54:51,370
Say thank you.

2769
02:54:51,370 --> 02:54:52,370
You are ungrateful.

2770
02:54:52,370 --> 02:54:53,930
Fuck.

2771
02:54:53,930 --> 02:54:54,930
What?

2772
02:54:54,930 --> 02:54:55,930
Whoa.

2773
02:54:55,930 --> 02:54:56,930
What do you mean?

2774
02:54:57,829 --> 02:55:00,370
Like the 10 out of 10 thing you're saying.

2775
02:55:00,370 --> 02:55:01,370
I said thank you.

2776
02:55:01,370 --> 02:55:02,370
I don't know what to say.

2777
02:55:02,370 --> 02:55:07,479
I don't know what to say about that.

2778
02:55:07,479 --> 02:55:08,479
It's fine.

2779
02:55:08,479 --> 02:55:09,479
He doesn't have to say thank you.

2780
02:55:09,479 --> 02:55:14,129
Am I going there?

2781
02:55:14,129 --> 02:55:15,129
Don't tell anybody.

2782
02:55:15,129 --> 02:55:19,309
I went the wrong way.

2783
02:55:19,309 --> 02:55:20,489
Don't tell anybody I went the wrong way.

2784
02:55:20,489 --> 02:55:21,489
They'll think I'm an idiot.

2785
02:55:21,489 --> 02:55:24,649
You can't do that.

2786
02:55:24,649 --> 02:55:27,489
No.

2787
02:55:27,489 --> 02:55:29,049
Don't you dare trickstab.

2788
02:55:29,049 --> 02:55:34,860
You're going to jump off a fucking rock.

2789
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:44,879
Somebody help me.

2790
02:55:44,879 --> 02:55:47,819
So bad.

2791
02:55:47,819 --> 02:55:50,780
It's a spy and he's a revolver and I have to get.

2792
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:55,899
It takes me two and a half seconds to shoot him.

2793
02:55:55,899 --> 02:55:56,899
What was that supposed to mean?

2794
02:55:56,899 --> 02:55:57,899
Huh?

2795
02:55:57,899 --> 02:55:58,899
What was that supposed to mean?

2796
02:55:58,899 --> 02:56:00,139
What was that supposed to mean?

2797
02:56:00,139 --> 02:56:01,139
I'm really bad at spy.

2798
02:56:01,139 --> 02:56:03,090
Is what that meant.

2799
02:56:03,090 --> 02:56:07,540
Listen, Jerma, if you're not ready to accept compliments, I want your chat to know that

2800
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:08,540
that's fine.

2801
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:12,770
Not everyone is like I'm not good at receiving compliments, but you know, you got to hear

2802
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:14,459
him more.

2803
02:56:14,459 --> 02:56:20,670
Does your chat let you know how fucking sexy you are?

2804
02:56:20,670 --> 02:56:23,829
Now?

2805
02:56:23,829 --> 02:56:24,829
What?

2806
02:56:24,829 --> 02:56:29,629
Now you're laughing about it?

2807
02:56:29,629 --> 02:56:32,920
Yeah.

2808
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:34,600
We're just bros being bros.

2809
02:56:34,600 --> 02:56:35,600
Like, bros can't compliment each other.

2810
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:36,600
Like, dude.

2811
02:56:36,600 --> 02:56:37,899
Yeah.

2812
02:56:37,899 --> 02:56:38,899
What's the problem?

2813
02:56:38,899 --> 02:56:39,899
What's the fuck?

2814
02:56:39,899 --> 02:56:43,379
What the fuck?

2815
02:56:43,379 --> 02:56:44,379
All right.

2816
02:56:44,379 --> 02:56:46,459
I'm going to lock and load.

2817
02:56:46,459 --> 02:56:47,459
Lock and load.

2818
02:56:47,459 --> 02:56:48,459
I.

2819
02:56:50,459 --> 02:56:59,379
Dick.

2820
02:56:59,379 --> 02:57:05,540
Let's go.

2821
02:57:05,540 --> 02:57:07,139
This has three shots now.

2822
02:57:07,139 --> 02:57:12,719
Wait, I feel like that was they're like little balls.

2823
02:57:12,719 --> 02:57:13,719
Hold on.

2824
02:57:13,719 --> 02:57:15,469
What does this weapon do now?

2825
02:57:15,469 --> 02:57:16,469
What weapon?

2826
02:57:16,469 --> 02:57:17,469
The lock and load.

2827
02:57:17,469 --> 02:57:21,979
It used to be cylinders.

2828
02:57:21,979 --> 02:57:22,979
Now it's like these little balls.

2829
02:57:22,979 --> 02:57:26,799
What's the speed damage versus buildings?

2830
02:57:26,799 --> 02:57:31,510
I think they just made it a little worse.

2831
02:57:31,510 --> 02:57:33,500
It sucks now.

2832
02:57:33,500 --> 02:57:34,500
It was always it was always three.

2833
02:57:34,500 --> 02:57:37,129
I thought it was two for some reason.

2834
02:57:37,129 --> 02:57:42,129
I believe it always was three, even though it has two slots.

2835
02:57:42,129 --> 02:57:44,520
That's probably what it is.

2836
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:51,370
But I do remember it also having like a crazy damage bonus that doesn't seem to have.

2837
02:57:51,370 --> 02:57:52,370
It was two.

2838
02:57:52,370 --> 02:57:53,370
It was.

2839
02:57:53,370 --> 02:57:54,370
Oh, yeah.

2840
02:57:54,370 --> 02:57:55,370
Yeah.

2841
02:57:55,370 --> 02:57:56,370
I think it was two at release and then they buffed it.

2842
02:57:56,370 --> 02:57:57,370
And then it was like, why is it three?

2843
02:57:57,370 --> 02:57:58,370
There's only two shots.

2844
02:57:58,370 --> 02:57:59,370
But it sounds different, too.

2845
02:57:59,370 --> 02:58:00,370
I think I remember there being something with that.

2846
02:58:00,930 --> 02:58:03,450
Compliment.

2847
02:58:03,450 --> 02:58:04,450
Stir back.

2848
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:05,450
I was stir.

2849
02:58:05,450 --> 02:58:08,010
You have very handsome beard.

2850
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:09,010
Thank you.

2851
02:58:09,010 --> 02:58:10,010
It hides my face.

2852
02:58:10,010 --> 02:58:15,809
It's not what I meant.

2853
02:58:15,809 --> 02:58:19,540
I know.

2854
02:58:19,540 --> 02:58:22,459
But if I didn't have it, then you'd be able to see my mandibles.

2855
02:58:22,459 --> 02:58:27,020
And you've been very physically fit recently, really kind of taking your health very seriously.

2856
02:58:27,020 --> 02:58:28,020
That's good, too.

2857
02:58:28,020 --> 02:58:29,020
I have not.

2858
02:58:29,020 --> 02:58:33,819
See, I'm not going to take compliments either.

2859
02:58:33,819 --> 02:58:34,819
Apparently not.

2860
02:58:34,819 --> 02:58:35,819
See?

2861
02:58:35,819 --> 02:58:36,819
Hard.

2862
02:58:36,819 --> 02:58:46,700
Yeah.

2863
02:58:46,700 --> 02:58:47,700
All right.

2864
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:51,879
They're probably going to go the other way now.

2865
02:58:51,879 --> 02:58:52,879
The other way.

2866
02:58:52,879 --> 02:58:53,879
They got to come this way.

2867
02:58:54,840 --> 02:59:03,889
Oh, OK.

2868
02:59:03,889 --> 02:59:04,889
They're coming up.

2869
02:59:04,889 --> 02:59:11,819
Wait, can I go in there?

2870
02:59:11,819 --> 02:59:12,819
Cats being bad.

2871
02:59:12,819 --> 02:59:13,819
You should turn face cam off.

2872
02:59:13,819 --> 02:59:16,260
Um, it's all right.

2873
02:59:16,260 --> 02:59:26,700
I want to be the swordsman.

2874
02:59:26,700 --> 02:59:27,700
I want it now.

2875
02:59:27,700 --> 02:59:35,940
I'm going to switch to medic in a little bit and I'm going to give you some crits.

2876
02:59:35,940 --> 02:59:36,940
I think.

2877
02:59:36,940 --> 02:59:38,500
What are you playing as?

2878
02:59:38,500 --> 02:59:39,500
Demo?

2879
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:42,469
Yeah.

2880
02:59:42,469 --> 02:59:44,149
There's no way he's dead.

2881
02:59:44,149 --> 02:59:45,149
I'm playing the swordsman.

2882
02:59:45,149 --> 02:59:47,389
Wait, you wanted to give crits?

2883
02:59:47,389 --> 02:59:48,750
I knew he was dead, too.

2884
02:59:48,750 --> 02:59:50,930
Is that a difference?

2885
02:59:50,930 --> 02:59:51,930
Hello?

2886
02:59:51,930 --> 02:59:52,930
Yes.

2887
02:59:52,930 --> 02:59:54,809
I want to give you crits.

2888
02:59:54,809 --> 02:59:57,709
Oh, goodness.

2889
02:59:57,709 --> 02:59:58,709
I was very.

2890
02:59:58,709 --> 03:00:03,149
I was paying a lot of attention.

2891
03:00:03,149 --> 03:00:04,149
This one's me.

2892
03:00:04,149 --> 03:00:10,260
You heard the Liberty Launchers, the best gun in the game.

2893
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:12,260
I have heard some theories about it.

2894
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:15,799
Do you disagree with those theories?

2895
03:00:15,799 --> 03:00:20,200
I trust your theories because I feel like you know kind of what you're talking about.

2896
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:21,200
That's a medic spy.

2897
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:22,200
Yep.

2898
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:31,309
Oh, fuck.

2899
03:00:31,309 --> 03:00:32,309
God damn it.

2900
03:00:32,309 --> 03:00:36,079
They came up with an Uber, too.

2901
03:00:36,079 --> 03:00:37,079
Yeah.

2902
03:00:37,079 --> 03:00:38,079
Ubers are kind of cheating.

2903
03:00:45,809 --> 03:00:46,809
Oh, shit.

2904
03:00:46,809 --> 03:00:53,700
How are we going to lose with Jormungandr on our team?

2905
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:54,700
Holy shit.

2906
03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:55,700
The whole team was dead.

2907
03:00:55,700 --> 03:00:57,659
We all just came out at the same time.

2908
03:00:57,659 --> 03:01:04,840
Oh, my God.

2909
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:05,840
You just run.

2910
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,079
Okay.

2911
03:01:07,079 --> 03:01:08,079
I'm worried about.

2912
03:01:08,079 --> 03:01:09,079
I wanted to save the.

2913
03:01:09,079 --> 03:01:10,079
It was a.

2914
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:11,079
It was.

2915
03:01:11,079 --> 03:01:12,079
Okay.

2916
03:01:12,079 --> 03:01:13,079
What the fuck?

2917
03:01:13,079 --> 03:01:14,079
That's a.

2918
03:01:14,079 --> 03:01:16,799
Do you want to give me the crits or do you want to run down and try and melee pyros?

2919
03:01:16,799 --> 03:01:17,799
The guy was running away.

2920
03:01:17,799 --> 03:01:28,120
I was trying to heal him.

2921
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:30,329
I was depending on you.

2922
03:01:30,329 --> 03:01:31,969
I almost have it.

2923
03:01:31,969 --> 03:01:34,530
And your goldfish brain activated.

2924
03:01:34,530 --> 03:01:36,530
There are 10 people on the team.

2925
03:01:36,530 --> 03:01:41,610
All right.

2926
03:01:41,610 --> 03:01:42,610
I got it.

2927
03:01:42,610 --> 03:01:43,610
Where are you?

2928
03:01:43,610 --> 03:01:46,000
Press E. Fuck you.

2929
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Where are you?

2930
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Press E. I heard spy.

2931
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:52,059
Keep going.

2932
03:01:52,059 --> 03:01:53,680
Keep going.

2933
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:54,680
Nice.

2934
03:01:54,680 --> 03:02:07,309
Oh, all right.

2935
03:02:07,309 --> 03:02:08,549
We did.

2936
03:02:08,549 --> 03:02:09,549
We did.

2937
03:02:09,549 --> 03:02:10,549
Good.

2938
03:02:10,549 --> 03:02:11,549
We did.

2939
03:02:11,549 --> 03:02:12,549
Good.

2940
03:02:12,549 --> 03:02:13,549
We got it.

2941
03:02:13,549 --> 03:02:14,549
We got it.

2942
03:02:14,549 --> 03:02:18,100
We did.

2943
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:19,100
We did.

2944
03:02:19,100 --> 03:02:20,100
Good.

2945
03:02:20,100 --> 03:02:21,100
I think I forced it.

2946
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:22,530
There weren't a lot of people, but I guess we did kill people.

2947
03:02:22,530 --> 03:02:23,530
So we did kill people.

2948
03:02:23,530 --> 03:02:33,729
They got a teleporter behind us.

2949
03:02:33,729 --> 03:02:34,729
I got to go do this.

2950
03:02:35,290 --> 03:02:36,530
I will handle it.

2951
03:02:36,530 --> 03:02:37,530
OK.

2952
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:39,540
I will be back here.

2953
03:02:39,540 --> 03:02:40,540
And you can come with.

2954
03:02:40,540 --> 03:02:42,540
Well, people need help over here.

2955
03:02:42,540 --> 03:02:47,940
Bad.

2956
03:02:47,940 --> 03:02:57,219
The guy who came up with the dead ringer.

2957
03:02:57,219 --> 03:02:59,100
Dead ringer is not that big of a problem.

2958
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:02,860
I think it's the dead ringer, spy, sickle combo potentially that because you can get

2959
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:03,860
out of a lot.

2960
03:03:03,860 --> 03:03:05,739
Jesus.

2961
03:03:05,739 --> 03:03:12,899
Back in my day, if you're if you died, you died.

2962
03:03:12,899 --> 03:03:18,180
If you're consistent and like, I mean, once I started really, oh, no, yeah, delete spy

2963
03:03:18,180 --> 03:03:19,180
from the game.

2964
03:03:19,180 --> 03:03:22,600
I agree.

2965
03:03:22,600 --> 03:03:29,469
See what?

2966
03:03:29,469 --> 03:03:34,620
No.

2967
03:03:34,620 --> 03:03:39,219
What if you start to pay attention to good despise?

2968
03:03:39,219 --> 03:03:40,219
I don't think he's dead.

2969
03:03:40,219 --> 03:03:43,250
It is.

2970
03:03:43,250 --> 03:03:48,780
So somebody has to be like constantly paying attention just constantly if there's a really

2971
03:03:48,780 --> 03:03:49,780
good spy on the team.

2972
03:03:49,780 --> 03:03:53,260
I can't.

2973
03:03:53,260 --> 03:03:55,950
But what if they make a mistake?

2974
03:03:55,950 --> 03:04:03,239
Shouldn't they die?

2975
03:04:03,239 --> 03:04:08,200
Didn't they nerf the dead ringer really, really bad at some point, like in 2015 or 2016?

2976
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:09,200
Yeah.

2977
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:12,260
But shouldn't they have done it four times?

2978
03:04:12,299 --> 03:04:15,739
I remember there was a pretty massive they made it loud, much louder, right?

2979
03:04:19,020 --> 03:04:20,659
I haven't maybe I'll play with it.

2980
03:04:20,659 --> 03:04:21,979
So yeah, that's a spy.

2981
03:04:21,979 --> 03:04:23,379
You're literally you're literally me.

2982
03:04:23,379 --> 03:04:24,379
There's three of you.

2983
03:04:24,379 --> 03:04:30,829
OK, now I think the problem is the spies that are on the other team are like they're just

2984
03:04:30,829 --> 03:04:32,430
there's like five of them.

2985
03:04:34,549 --> 03:05:02,180
One of them was me being extra paranoid.

2986
03:05:04,590 --> 03:05:05,670
Don't you think it's weird?

2987
03:05:11,430 --> 03:05:12,790
All right, we're getting a little too far up here.

2988
03:05:20,559 --> 03:05:22,440
This is kind of this is kind of scary.

2989
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:23,200
This is scary.

2990
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:24,079
We don't have Chris yet.

2991
03:05:24,079 --> 03:05:25,280
This is scary what we're doing.

2992
03:05:26,219 --> 03:05:27,540
Well, it looks like I'm behind you.

2993
03:05:27,540 --> 03:05:30,459
I'm behind you along with spy number 16.

2994
03:05:32,989 --> 03:05:35,989
I think he's still like, yeah, I don't know who's who.

2995
03:05:37,260 --> 03:05:38,620
Me neither. Let's walk forward.

2996
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:39,180
Come with me.

2997
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:40,180
Wait, wait, I need to heal his viral.

2998
03:05:40,180 --> 03:05:41,459
Come on. Yes, I do.

2999
03:05:41,459 --> 03:05:42,459
I'm a team player.

3000
03:05:44,530 --> 03:05:45,729
You're going to get back. He's not dead.

3001
03:05:48,690 --> 03:05:49,610
Do you do you want it?

3002
03:05:49,610 --> 03:05:50,850
There's people everywhere, dude.

3003
03:05:51,690 --> 03:05:52,690
Do you want it or not?

3004
03:05:52,690 --> 03:05:54,489
No, no. Am I screaming?

3005
03:05:54,930 --> 03:05:56,329
I would get scared the shit out of me.

3006
03:05:57,750 --> 03:05:59,270
Just don't get back. I thought it was going to die.

3007
03:06:00,610 --> 03:06:04,670
Did you? I have no ammo.

3008
03:06:04,670 --> 03:06:06,590
If I die because of this, I will be pissed.

3009
03:06:11,620 --> 03:06:17,190
Just just keep yourself busy.

3010
03:06:17,190 --> 03:06:18,629
I'm so busy, honey.

3011
03:06:18,629 --> 03:06:20,469
But here's an iPad.

3012
03:06:20,469 --> 03:06:25,620
Oh, I can make the crates.

3013
03:06:28,180 --> 03:06:31,100
I don't know if you could guess, but there is a there was a

3014
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:47,239
high five behind us.

3015
03:06:47,239 --> 03:06:48,680
I'm trying to eat his sandwich.

3016
03:06:48,680 --> 03:06:49,719
TF2 on iPad.

3017
03:06:49,719 --> 03:06:51,200
That should be pretty.

3018
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:55,899
That would be pretty lit.

3019
03:06:55,899 --> 03:06:59,049
Would it?

3020
03:06:59,049 --> 03:07:01,209
No. Will you get out of here?

3021
03:07:01,209 --> 03:07:03,090
Get out of here.

3022
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:04,969
You give your little Billy.

3023
03:07:04,969 --> 03:07:07,129
Give little. Oh, God.

3024
03:07:07,129 --> 03:07:12,840
That guy should be dead.

3025
03:07:12,840 --> 03:07:14,760
All right. I must have some

3026
03:07:14,760 --> 03:07:17,120
bullets for you if you want some.

3027
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:26,450
I'm coming. I'm dead.

3028
03:07:26,450 --> 03:07:27,370
Give it to someone else.

3029
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:28,610
I'm about to.

3030
03:07:28,610 --> 03:07:33,520
Why is this thing not charging?

3031
03:07:33,520 --> 03:07:36,819
Come on, heavy. Go for it.

3032
03:07:36,819 --> 03:07:40,260
No, no, no.

3033
03:07:40,780 --> 03:07:43,879
Get it. How many are there, two?

3034
03:07:43,879 --> 03:07:45,520
How many people does it take to kill one spy?

3035
03:07:45,520 --> 03:07:47,600
That was like 11 people versus one guy.

3036
03:07:50,049 --> 03:07:52,489
We're good. How much damage reduction does the dead bringer give?

3037
03:07:55,829 --> 03:07:57,079
I don't know.

3038
03:07:57,079 --> 03:07:58,440
I think it's like 90 percent.

3039
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:09,079
Let's leave. OK.

3040
03:08:09,079 --> 03:08:10,120
Op score.

3041
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:11,479
Would I get a top score?

3042
03:08:11,479 --> 03:08:17,069
I don't think so.

3043
03:08:17,069 --> 03:08:23,889
That doesn't even say on the item.

3044
03:08:23,889 --> 03:08:27,090
I think this is coal allows you to see enemy health.

3045
03:08:33,090 --> 03:08:36,770
Sixty five percent damage reduction. Lame.

3046
03:08:37,409 --> 03:08:40,489
Collect the organs of people you hit with the Vita saw.

3047
03:08:40,489 --> 03:08:45,639
What was this before?

3048
03:08:45,639 --> 03:08:47,959
Oh, no, it looks like it's still the same.

3049
03:08:51,370 --> 03:08:55,780
Wait, that's actually kind of good.

3050
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:57,299
What is organs?

3051
03:08:57,299 --> 03:08:58,219
I don't know.

3052
03:08:58,219 --> 03:09:00,819
So this is the one that keeps Uber if you're dead.

3053
03:09:01,340 --> 03:09:03,690
You get to keep a certain percent.

3054
03:09:03,690 --> 03:09:06,170
So percentage of your Uber charge level is retained on death

3055
03:09:06,170 --> 03:09:08,409
based on the number of organs harvested.

3056
03:09:08,409 --> 03:09:10,010
Fifteen percent per.

3057
03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:12,290
And you can get caps out at 60.

3058
03:09:15,360 --> 03:09:18,379
I think you have to hit people with it, though.

3059
03:09:18,379 --> 03:09:23,110
Minus 10 health.

3060
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:24,389
If you're going to hit people, you might as well hit them.

3061
03:09:24,389 --> 03:09:25,750
Oh, my God. That's true.

3062
03:09:25,750 --> 03:09:28,270
You want to play Phoenix again?

3063
03:09:28,270 --> 03:09:29,870
Oh, I don't mind.

3064
03:09:29,909 --> 03:09:31,629
I'm I'm leaving.

3065
03:09:31,629 --> 03:09:33,190
I want to I want a different thing.

3066
03:09:33,190 --> 03:09:36,790
I'll take it off the list. OK.

3067
03:09:36,790 --> 03:09:46,500
I am out.

3068
03:09:46,500 --> 03:09:50,040
Let's start startling down to them.

3069
03:09:50,040 --> 03:09:51,479
Let's play some like classic ones.

3070
03:09:51,479 --> 03:09:56,379
Let's go to like, like nucleus or harvest, right?

3071
03:09:57,620 --> 03:10:05,139
Or bad water was that bad water an hour ago.

3072
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:16,860
Yeah, it's been a while.

3073
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:20,090
Sawmill. Yeah, so I'm a good one, too.

3074
03:10:20,090 --> 03:10:21,850
I don't think I want to play too for it.

3075
03:10:21,850 --> 03:10:22,770
Maybe not yet.

3076
03:10:22,770 --> 03:10:25,719
Undermountain. Undermountain is a good one.

3077
03:10:25,719 --> 03:10:26,680
Don't play Brazil.

3078
03:10:26,680 --> 03:10:30,290
I want to go to Thunder Mountain.

3079
03:10:30,290 --> 03:10:41,219
OK. Oh, ready to go to thunder.

3080
03:10:41,219 --> 03:10:45,059
Oh, here's the thunder because he lays down that lumber or something.

3081
03:10:49,110 --> 03:10:53,379
Oh, frontier. Cool.

3082
03:10:53,379 --> 03:10:56,739
Shout it from the mountaintops, baby.

3083
03:10:56,739 --> 03:11:01,430
Undermountain server is changing the way it actually is.

3084
03:11:04,309 --> 03:11:06,110
Yeah, a lot of time when you casual queue,

3085
03:11:06,110 --> 03:11:08,149
you'll get into a game at the end of the game because that's

3086
03:11:08,149 --> 03:11:09,790
what everyone leaves to find a good game.

3087
03:11:09,790 --> 03:11:11,959
But if you, you know, you see what I'm saying?

3088
03:11:11,959 --> 03:11:14,760
I kind of hope is going to Egypt.

3089
03:11:14,760 --> 03:11:17,000
Oh, God, I played Egypt the other day.

3090
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:19,079
Once was enough.

3091
03:11:20,540 --> 03:11:25,180
All right, let's let me let me do something here.

3092
03:11:33,100 --> 03:11:38,360
Soldier has a lot of cool weapons.

3093
03:11:38,360 --> 03:11:39,479
Let's just go default.

3094
03:11:39,479 --> 03:11:43,159
Default rocket launcher like like it's a lot of cool weapons.

3095
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:52,270
I you will use none of them with the pen.

3096
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:59,920
This brings me back to like 2000, like 11, 2012.

3097
03:12:02,260 --> 03:12:06,219
My biggest nostalgia map turned out to be Snakewater.

3098
03:12:06,860 --> 03:12:11,780
Yeah. Snakewater.

3099
03:12:11,780 --> 03:12:14,340
What was the one that it was two payloads that had to cross each other?

3100
03:12:14,340 --> 03:12:16,709
You each had to push one.

3101
03:12:16,709 --> 03:12:18,750
There's Hightower.

3102
03:12:18,750 --> 03:12:21,989
And that one is the one that they cross paths.

3103
03:12:23,340 --> 03:12:26,620
I've been trying to remember the name of that one, too.

3104
03:12:26,620 --> 03:12:28,180
Not Hightower.

3105
03:12:28,180 --> 03:12:30,030
There was payload race.

3106
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:31,590
Pipeline. Yep. Yep.

3107
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:34,510
Pipeline. That place sucked ass, but it was so fun to play.

3108
03:12:36,350 --> 03:12:38,389
That's not what I expect you to say.

3109
03:12:38,389 --> 03:12:39,469
I mean, it did. Oh, yeah.

3110
03:12:39,469 --> 03:12:41,750
Oh, yeah. Pipeline that I fucking that.

3111
03:12:41,909 --> 03:12:43,500
Mm hmm.

3112
03:12:43,500 --> 03:12:46,219
Yeah, but it was a ton of it was a ton of fun to play.

3113
03:12:46,219 --> 03:12:48,219
But that place was just a mess.

3114
03:12:48,219 --> 03:12:50,659
But when the two carts were in the middle together,

3115
03:12:51,659 --> 03:12:53,059
it was just a mess.

3116
03:13:02,920 --> 03:13:05,040
The enemy team comes from up here where you're looking.

3117
03:13:07,049 --> 03:13:10,770
That's the enemy team spawn.

3118
03:13:11,700 --> 03:13:14,020
They're going to want to back up because they come out in 10 seconds.

3119
03:13:14,459 --> 03:13:15,579
I know what I'm doing.

3120
03:13:15,579 --> 03:13:17,819
And they are going to come out with an Uber. Good.

3121
03:13:19,219 --> 03:13:21,420
For those of you who haven't seen this game before,

3122
03:13:21,420 --> 03:13:24,299
an Uber makes them invulnerable and a medic gets it after a certain amount

3123
03:13:24,299 --> 03:13:30,219
of charge. It's an ultimate ability.

3124
03:13:30,219 --> 03:13:45,590
That isn't a spy.

3125
03:13:45,590 --> 03:13:54,659
Is this by get a dishwasher?

3126
03:13:54,659 --> 03:14:07,809
Oh, go, go, go. Quick, quick.

3127
03:14:07,809 --> 03:14:13,969
That guy is good.

3128
03:14:13,969 --> 03:14:17,010
Don't you? He's not dead.

3129
03:14:22,229 --> 03:14:24,309
Oh, shit. The engineer died.

3130
03:14:24,309 --> 03:14:26,670
Why? I'm going to stand in front of the fucking killed the engineer.

3131
03:14:26,709 --> 03:14:27,670
I'm going to say anyone.

3132
03:14:27,670 --> 03:14:32,719
I'm literally going to take any damage.

3133
03:14:32,719 --> 03:14:35,079
I'm going to use my I'm using my body to make sure there's nobody here.

3134
03:14:35,079 --> 03:14:37,219
It's this. Oh, man.

3135
03:14:37,219 --> 03:14:38,340
I don't care if I die. Tell me more.

3136
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:39,899
Tell me. Tell me what you're doing with your body.

3137
03:14:39,899 --> 03:14:44,399
All right. He's back to this fucking spy.

3138
03:14:50,350 --> 03:14:51,590
Your health seems low.

3139
03:14:51,590 --> 03:14:55,309
If you want to know, maybe there's a dispenser.

3140
03:14:55,829 --> 03:14:57,350
We have no medics. Oh, shit.

3141
03:14:57,350 --> 03:15:05,780
I'm going to come heal you. OK.

3142
03:15:05,780 --> 03:15:07,500
Oh, you've got this pal.

3143
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:09,979
There's a demo in the hallway.

3144
03:15:09,979 --> 03:15:11,899
Hit in the distance. I'm dead.

3145
03:15:11,899 --> 03:15:14,409
I'm dead, too.

3146
03:15:14,409 --> 03:15:28,549
Got to watch out for those.

3147
03:15:28,549 --> 03:15:30,709
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3148
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:47,180
I don't even. Oh, he's up there.

3149
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:50,059
Honest, honestly, who's your favorite character from World of Warcraft?

3150
03:15:53,940 --> 03:15:57,829
Um, that's a good question, dude.

3151
03:15:58,430 --> 03:15:59,909
That's that. Thanks.

3152
03:15:59,909 --> 03:16:02,940
Hold on. I got a minute because I'm dead.

3153
03:16:02,940 --> 03:16:05,340
Who's the best character from World of Warcraft?

3154
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:06,620
Your favorite, not the best.

3155
03:16:06,620 --> 03:16:08,260
The best is obviously Sylvanas.

3156
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:10,379
She's so powerful and so relevant all the time.

3157
03:16:12,770 --> 03:16:16,090
This is going to be a stupid answer, but I don't know if it is or not.

3158
03:16:17,090 --> 03:16:21,350
Uh, I got shot in the chest by this.

3159
03:16:21,350 --> 03:16:23,989
This is like a 14 kill streak.

3160
03:16:24,190 --> 03:16:26,670
Am I going to go pyro against hold the button down in a circle?

3161
03:16:28,270 --> 03:16:32,870
I mean, no one is even like I just watched like three people in a row

3162
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:35,149
actually AFK standing still that he stabbed.

3163
03:16:35,729 --> 03:16:39,059
There's not much threat.

3164
03:16:39,059 --> 03:16:43,340
Uh, Kelthuzad, either Kelthuzad or Kael'thas.

3165
03:16:44,149 --> 03:16:44,989
There you go.

3166
03:16:44,989 --> 03:16:47,389
Why is Kelthuzad your favorite or Kael'thas?

3167
03:16:47,389 --> 03:16:48,309
Because they're like, I don't know,

3168
03:16:48,469 --> 03:16:50,899
they're kind of like they're goofy.

3169
03:16:50,899 --> 03:16:53,100
And Kelthuzad is like, I need more power.

3170
03:16:53,420 --> 03:16:55,379
Give me the mana, more mana.

3171
03:16:55,379 --> 03:16:56,459
Like, you know, he was cool.

3172
03:16:56,459 --> 03:16:58,579
I like to build sentries with.

3173
03:16:58,579 --> 03:17:02,399
Yeah, I got the crits.

3174
03:17:02,399 --> 03:17:03,840
Frank, let's go, Frank.

3175
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:05,040
All right, I'll tell you when to do it.

3176
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:08,639
Ready and activate.

3177
03:17:10,909 --> 03:17:13,229
Why did you not do it? I told you to do it.

3178
03:17:13,229 --> 03:17:14,829
What are you doing?

3179
03:17:14,829 --> 03:17:17,110
I just told you activate and you didn't do it.

3180
03:17:17,110 --> 03:17:18,309
I got hit the fucking head.

3181
03:17:18,309 --> 03:17:21,340
Activate means.

3182
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:23,100
Why did you not do it?

3183
03:17:23,180 --> 03:17:30,229
Why didn't you scream?

3184
03:17:30,229 --> 03:17:33,319
I guess you're right, I didn't scream.

3185
03:17:33,319 --> 03:17:35,559
Oh, well, there goes another crits.

3186
03:17:35,559 --> 03:17:38,530
Just totally wasted.

3187
03:17:38,530 --> 03:17:40,030
I died.

3188
03:17:40,030 --> 03:17:42,190
We probably would have killed at least three people.

3189
03:17:43,729 --> 03:17:49,809
But only you had just screamed.

3190
03:17:50,649 --> 03:17:53,090
Well, that's that's your activation, not mine.

3191
03:17:55,549 --> 03:17:58,149
Yeah, and I'm the medic and I want my activation.

3192
03:17:58,750 --> 03:18:01,549
I get to call the shots.

3193
03:18:01,549 --> 03:18:04,379
The medic has the power.

3194
03:18:04,379 --> 03:18:05,620
You never knew that.

3195
03:18:05,620 --> 03:18:07,620
There's somebody, there's a spy.

3196
03:18:07,620 --> 03:18:10,829
They're all behind us.

3197
03:18:10,870 --> 03:18:13,899
What the fuck?

3198
03:18:13,899 --> 03:18:16,540
It really has just been all spies.

3199
03:18:18,020 --> 03:18:26,629
I'm every game.

3200
03:18:26,629 --> 03:18:33,629
Oh, I have one help.

3201
03:18:33,629 --> 03:18:39,309
I got the crits.

3202
03:18:39,309 --> 03:18:40,829
Where's Papa Papa?

3203
03:18:40,829 --> 03:18:49,920
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

3204
03:18:49,920 --> 03:18:53,620
I don't trust it, but who knows?

3205
03:18:53,620 --> 03:18:56,559
OK, all right.

3206
03:19:00,290 --> 03:19:02,030
Not yet.

3207
03:19:02,030 --> 03:19:03,950
Uh huh. I'll know.

3208
03:19:12,579 --> 03:19:13,899
Dude, I don't play this game.

3209
03:19:13,899 --> 03:19:15,059
I don't play this game that often.

3210
03:19:15,059 --> 03:19:15,899
It's never you should never do it.

3211
03:19:15,899 --> 03:19:19,940
Don't ever do that again.

3212
03:19:19,940 --> 03:19:20,819
Germa, I've got the crits.

3213
03:19:20,819 --> 03:19:21,819
Where are you?

3214
03:19:25,850 --> 03:19:30,139
Damn it.

3215
03:19:30,139 --> 03:19:32,059
They were also spread out and I was so paranoid

3216
03:19:32,059 --> 03:19:37,579
I was going to get backstabbed.

3217
03:19:37,579 --> 03:19:41,760
Well, you know what they say?

3218
03:19:41,760 --> 03:19:53,389
Your responsibility is a 10.

3219
03:19:53,389 --> 03:20:06,180
Oh, I'm going to change to the pen.

3220
03:20:06,540 --> 03:20:08,340
Equip the pen. Equip the pen.

3221
03:20:08,340 --> 03:20:10,180
Heavy seems like a really stupid idea right now,

3222
03:20:10,180 --> 03:20:11,299
because it's just spies.

3223
03:20:11,299 --> 03:20:14,219
It does. Just circling us like don't do it.

3224
03:20:14,620 --> 03:20:16,260
Don't do it. I'm going to do it.

3225
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:17,940
I'm going to do the heater.

3226
03:20:17,940 --> 03:20:19,340
Oh, my goodness.

3227
03:20:19,379 --> 03:20:21,879
They ain't going to fucking get near us now.

3228
03:20:21,879 --> 03:20:23,120
He's brilliant.

3229
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:26,020
They won't simply just walk through it

3230
03:20:26,020 --> 03:20:37,260
and then never, ever, ever die.

3231
03:20:37,260 --> 03:20:47,209
At least we can see where they are.

3232
03:20:47,209 --> 03:20:57,459
I need I need mana.

3233
03:20:57,459 --> 03:20:58,620
Don't backstab me. Don't backstab me.

3234
03:20:58,620 --> 03:21:01,340
Don't backstab me, please.

3235
03:21:01,340 --> 03:21:10,709
Why would you eat it into the wall?

3236
03:21:10,709 --> 03:21:13,909
Did I just get crit with a was it a random crit?

3237
03:21:13,909 --> 03:21:16,190
Yep. And then I turned around and there was a spy.

3238
03:21:16,190 --> 03:21:17,389
There's a spy. There's a spy.

3239
03:21:17,389 --> 03:21:18,549
There's a spy. There's a spy.

3240
03:21:18,549 --> 03:21:19,670
There's a spy.

3241
03:21:19,670 --> 03:21:20,950
There's a spy.

3242
03:21:20,950 --> 03:21:22,229
There's a spy.

3243
03:21:22,229 --> 03:21:24,110
There's a spy.

3244
03:21:25,350 --> 03:21:27,829
Are there any other classes in this game?

3245
03:21:27,829 --> 03:21:29,780
We're fine.

3246
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:31,780
I spawn new spy.

3247
03:21:31,780 --> 03:21:35,219
We're fine.

3248
03:21:35,219 --> 03:21:42,579
Demo player left.

3249
03:21:42,579 --> 03:21:48,639
Oh, my God.

3250
03:21:48,639 --> 03:21:51,500
I even was looking around for him.

3251
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:53,020
I'm surrounded by fucking fire.

3252
03:21:53,020 --> 03:21:58,090
What the hell happened there?

3253
03:21:58,090 --> 03:22:00,729
They can still stab you if you're surrounded by fire

3254
03:22:00,729 --> 03:22:02,010
that deals three damage.

3255
03:22:02,010 --> 03:22:05,340
Yeah, but he shouldn't they light on fire?

3256
03:22:05,340 --> 03:22:06,700
I thought that was the whole point.

3257
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:09,690
It's not constant.

3258
03:22:09,690 --> 03:22:11,170
Like, there's there's like pulses.

3259
03:22:11,170 --> 03:22:13,930
They can get in between the hole.

3260
03:22:13,930 --> 03:22:32,090
It's all that common.

3261
03:22:32,090 --> 03:22:34,260
I'll take care of it.

3262
03:22:34,260 --> 03:22:36,899
Got him.

3263
03:22:36,899 --> 03:22:50,309
Thanks, Frank, the tank.

3264
03:22:50,309 --> 03:22:52,110
That person's item says, hey, star,

3265
03:22:52,110 --> 03:22:54,629
like, I'm going to kill your head or something.

3266
03:22:54,629 --> 03:22:57,229
That's a threat I can sue.

3267
03:22:57,229 --> 03:23:13,729
How did they can't kill my head?

3268
03:23:13,729 --> 03:23:15,489
Nobody messing around here.

3269
03:23:15,489 --> 03:23:17,129
You want to crit for who are you?

3270
03:23:17,129 --> 03:23:19,250
I'm a pyro. I don't think it's a good idea.

3271
03:23:19,250 --> 03:23:25,790
I think it's a great idea.

3272
03:23:25,790 --> 03:23:28,090
But where are you?

3273
03:23:28,090 --> 03:23:36,559
Dead at the moment.

3274
03:23:36,559 --> 03:23:38,319
I'm going to see Barbie tonight.

3275
03:23:38,319 --> 03:23:41,469
Nice.

3276
03:23:41,469 --> 03:23:45,290
Let's watch Barbie together.

3277
03:23:45,290 --> 03:23:51,940
Good if you really wanted to.

3278
03:23:51,940 --> 03:23:55,420
Because Vegas have like a giganto theater

3279
03:23:55,420 --> 03:23:56,780
where you can buy out the whole thing

3280
03:23:56,780 --> 03:24:00,049
and it can just be us in it.

3281
03:24:00,049 --> 03:24:01,610
Why would you want to do that?

3282
03:24:01,610 --> 03:24:07,329
Because no one will see us hold hands.

3283
03:24:07,329 --> 03:24:08,409
Let's go.

3284
03:24:08,409 --> 03:24:12,799
Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go.

3285
03:24:12,799 --> 03:24:14,360
I just got crit by that shotgun.

3286
03:24:14,360 --> 03:24:18,940
God damn.

3287
03:24:18,940 --> 03:24:20,899
They kind of just get them.

3288
03:24:20,899 --> 03:24:25,190
That's so funny.

3289
03:24:25,190 --> 03:24:46,530
I was dead anyway, so it's all right.

3290
03:24:46,530 --> 03:24:47,170
Oh, should I?

3291
03:24:47,170 --> 03:24:50,340
At least I helped his dead body, apparently.

3292
03:24:50,340 --> 03:24:52,629
Yeah, thank you, Frank.

3293
03:24:52,629 --> 03:24:55,149
Really going to start calling you Frank a lot.

3294
03:24:55,149 --> 03:24:59,500
That's fine.

3295
03:24:59,500 --> 03:25:01,379
Yeah, I know the streamer like that.

3296
03:25:01,379 --> 03:25:05,389
I can call him by his first name.

3297
03:25:05,389 --> 03:25:07,409
What is it?

3298
03:25:07,409 --> 03:25:08,889
OK, do we get him?

3299
03:25:08,889 --> 03:25:11,739
We got a big deal or anything to me, though.

3300
03:25:11,739 --> 03:25:15,700
Frank, not doing bad.

3301
03:25:15,700 --> 03:25:20,340
We're doing fine.

3302
03:25:20,340 --> 03:25:20,860
I'm dead.

3303
03:25:20,860 --> 03:25:23,600
I don't want to play medic anymore.

3304
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:26,389
You know what I mean?

3305
03:25:26,389 --> 03:25:30,420
You ever just reach your limits?

3306
03:25:30,420 --> 03:25:42,889
What the fuck?

3307
03:25:42,889 --> 03:25:47,909
Watch that door.

3308
03:25:47,909 --> 03:25:50,690
I'm watching it.

3309
03:25:50,690 --> 03:25:51,489
I need ammo.

3310
03:25:51,489 --> 03:26:00,340
Is there a dispenser over here?

3311
03:26:00,340 --> 03:26:04,200
Oh, I need dispenser.

3312
03:26:04,200 --> 03:26:06,120
Where's the dispenser?

3313
03:26:06,120 --> 03:26:09,879
I need a dispenser.

3314
03:26:09,879 --> 03:26:12,639
There are other sources of ammo.

3315
03:26:12,639 --> 03:26:19,719
I know, I got it.

3316
03:26:19,719 --> 03:26:20,879
That's a lot of Pyros.

3317
03:26:20,879 --> 03:26:31,569
That's a lot of Uber.

3318
03:26:31,610 --> 03:26:35,700
That's the biggest piss I've ever taken for men.

3319
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:39,610
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

3320
03:26:39,610 --> 03:26:49,340
I haven't hit anyone with this.

3321
03:26:49,340 --> 03:26:51,360
Are you using the pen?

3322
03:26:51,360 --> 03:26:53,739
The pen?

3323
03:26:53,739 --> 03:26:56,170
Are you actually using it?

3324
03:26:56,170 --> 03:26:56,930
The what?

3325
03:26:56,930 --> 03:26:58,569
The pen.

3326
03:26:58,569 --> 03:27:01,829
I put the pen.

3327
03:27:01,829 --> 03:27:04,299
Please, Jerma.

3328
03:27:04,299 --> 03:27:17,440
I will before the stream ends.

3329
03:27:17,440 --> 03:27:28,100
Help, help.

3330
03:27:28,100 --> 03:27:33,299
I'm going to hit someone.

3331
03:27:33,299 --> 03:27:34,850
Just wait.

3332
03:27:34,850 --> 03:27:43,030
I feel like I haven't been hitting anybody either.

3333
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:47,780
Wait, this is a bunch of ammo down here, isn't there?

3334
03:27:47,780 --> 03:27:50,430
Full box, yes.

3335
03:27:50,430 --> 03:27:53,440
Do you know that when you kill people, they drop ammo boxes?

3336
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:55,159
I have to kill them, though.

3337
03:27:55,159 --> 03:28:03,629
I want to be sure to have the sure thing.

3338
03:28:03,629 --> 03:28:09,159
Just letting you know, not a lot of people have played this game.

3339
03:28:09,159 --> 03:28:12,479
No one really knows what's going on right now.

3340
03:28:12,479 --> 03:28:13,680
We could explain it.

3341
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:14,319
We should.

3342
03:28:14,319 --> 03:28:16,600
You want to do like a class in TF2?

3343
03:28:16,600 --> 03:28:18,129
Sure.

3344
03:28:18,129 --> 03:28:19,450
You want to be the teacher?

3345
03:28:19,450 --> 03:28:25,260
Well, they're going to have to pay up.

3346
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:35,379
$60 an hour lessons for TF2 esports coaching.

3347
03:28:35,420 --> 03:28:37,750
Let's go.

3348
03:28:37,750 --> 03:28:41,629
I'm not even aiming near people.

3349
03:28:41,629 --> 03:28:48,709
I'm cracking out right now, dude.

3350
03:28:48,709 --> 03:28:52,540
What am I doing?

3351
03:28:52,540 --> 03:28:56,420
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3352
03:28:56,420 --> 03:29:00,020
I'm fine.

3353
03:29:00,020 --> 03:29:04,729
Is there just a Spencer around here?

3354
03:29:04,729 --> 03:29:06,969
I kind of cracked out a little.

3355
03:29:06,969 --> 03:29:08,969
You're kind of cracking a little bit.

3356
03:29:08,969 --> 03:29:16,959
Your skin's kind of cracking.

3357
03:29:16,959 --> 03:29:22,100
I'm going for at least number three on the scoreboard this round.

3358
03:29:22,100 --> 03:29:27,489
Or honorary mention.

3359
03:29:27,489 --> 03:29:32,440
What the fuck did he just wait?

3360
03:29:32,440 --> 03:29:33,360
What's going on up there?

3361
03:29:33,360 --> 03:29:34,200
Did I stop doing that?

3362
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:34,840
Oh, they're having fun.

3363
03:29:34,840 --> 03:29:42,139
OK, never mind.

3364
03:29:42,139 --> 03:29:51,719
Yeah, well, hey, this server, this server.

3365
03:29:51,719 --> 03:29:56,120
I didn't kill them in 10 seconds going.

3366
03:29:56,120 --> 03:30:03,500
It's all or nothing time.

3367
03:30:03,500 --> 03:30:05,379
Yeah, I was aiming at you.

3368
03:30:05,379 --> 03:30:07,969
Here it comes.

3369
03:30:07,969 --> 03:30:10,690
Oh, I didn't get up there.

3370
03:30:10,690 --> 03:30:12,979
Thirty nine points.

3371
03:30:12,979 --> 03:30:15,620
Would you have forty four or fifty two?

3372
03:30:15,620 --> 03:30:21,760
I think I hit two arrows.

3373
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:23,260
That was fun.

3374
03:30:23,260 --> 03:30:26,110
This game is fun.

3375
03:30:26,110 --> 03:30:27,649
Have you played it before?

3376
03:30:27,649 --> 03:30:34,430
Briefly, I think I'm going to go.

3377
03:30:34,430 --> 03:30:38,309
Who would have thought a simple game like this would have bred

3378
03:30:38,309 --> 03:30:41,590
the sexiest, most attractive streamer on Twitch?

3379
03:30:41,590 --> 03:30:43,110
You're on to this today.

3380
03:30:43,110 --> 03:30:44,510
This is like your thing today.

3381
03:30:44,510 --> 03:30:45,709
I don't know why.

3382
03:30:45,709 --> 03:30:47,709
Why is this your thing today?

3383
03:30:47,709 --> 03:30:51,229
It really all just comes back to Team Fortress 2.

3384
03:30:51,229 --> 03:30:53,030
Why is this your thing today?

3385
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:06,329
I'm going to just be a dickhead this round, so see if I can make it happen.

3386
03:31:06,370 --> 03:31:07,770
I'm going to be a dickhead this round.

3387
03:31:07,770 --> 03:31:10,219
What does that mean?

3388
03:31:10,219 --> 03:31:22,579
Yeah, you two spies think you're so fucking smart.

3389
03:31:22,579 --> 03:31:24,860
I'm going to click their head real gun.

3390
03:31:24,860 --> 03:31:26,100
OK, I really.

3391
03:31:26,100 --> 03:31:27,819
Wait, the good spies on our team now.

3392
03:31:27,819 --> 03:31:37,459
Oh, my God, that's amazing. Thank God.

3393
03:31:37,459 --> 03:31:41,219
You better go get them.

3394
03:31:41,219 --> 03:31:44,579
You better really step up this round.

3395
03:31:44,579 --> 03:31:51,879
No excuses, man.

3396
03:31:51,879 --> 03:32:03,149
All right, let's go really step up, bro.

3397
03:32:03,149 --> 03:32:05,430
This is bullshit. You're trying to pull on me right now.

3398
03:32:05,430 --> 03:32:09,989
Did you hear the rumor, by the way, that they're adding another class to the game?

3399
03:32:09,989 --> 03:32:12,069
I did not. I think that you made it up.

3400
03:32:12,069 --> 03:32:14,190
It's going to be like a dog.

3401
03:32:16,430 --> 03:32:17,149
There's like a dog.

3402
03:32:17,149 --> 03:32:19,670
There's like a mechanical thing on its back.

3403
03:32:19,670 --> 03:32:22,870
People just brought it into the train.

3404
03:32:22,870 --> 03:32:30,709
It ate like three people.

3405
03:32:30,709 --> 03:32:32,809
Shit, should have turned around.

3406
03:32:32,809 --> 03:32:34,530
And the train hit people.

3407
03:32:34,530 --> 03:32:36,819
The dog class. Yeah.

3408
03:32:38,399 --> 03:32:42,200
What would the dog class's loadout default loadout be?

3409
03:32:45,260 --> 03:32:48,370
The woofer. OK.

3410
03:32:48,370 --> 03:32:51,809
Is this like an arcing lightning wand or something?

3411
03:32:52,649 --> 03:32:54,389
What are you talking about?

3412
03:32:54,389 --> 03:32:57,049
What does it do?

3413
03:32:57,049 --> 03:32:59,370
I'd have to go. There's a meet the dog that leaked.

3414
03:33:07,350 --> 03:33:11,200
Oh, nice. Oh, oh, there's too many people on the cart.

3415
03:33:11,200 --> 03:33:12,760
The spies here somewhere.

3416
03:33:16,670 --> 03:33:18,469
Dude, I fucking popped off a little bit right there.

3417
03:33:18,469 --> 03:33:26,100
It's all right.

3418
03:33:26,100 --> 03:33:27,780
All right. For those that have no idea,

3419
03:33:27,780 --> 03:33:32,290
because it is actually probably worth explaining some of these things explain,

3420
03:33:32,729 --> 03:33:35,729
explain with if I kill somebody with these gloves,

3421
03:33:36,170 --> 03:33:38,649
I get 100 percent crits for five seconds.

3422
03:33:39,260 --> 03:33:42,930
I then because it's not very much time, you can either keep these on.

3423
03:33:42,930 --> 03:33:44,889
I like to go to the family business.

3424
03:33:44,889 --> 03:33:46,049
This is a shotgun.

3425
03:33:46,049 --> 03:33:48,270
You get 100 percent crits on any weapon.

3426
03:33:48,270 --> 03:33:50,790
And this thing has a bunch of clips and you can pretty much get,

3427
03:33:51,229 --> 03:33:54,549
I would say, all eight shots out in that five seconds.

3428
03:33:57,569 --> 03:34:06,040
Fat scout. Yeah, it's pretty fun.

3429
03:34:07,129 --> 03:34:09,129
There's definitely a lot of people that probably don't really know.

3430
03:34:09,129 --> 03:34:14,149
So sincerely speaking, it's probably not a bad idea to teach them.

3431
03:34:14,149 --> 03:34:17,229
Well, because people you know this as well as I do.

3432
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:20,790
A lot of people jump into this game and they get backstabbed

3433
03:34:20,790 --> 03:34:22,030
and then they uninstall the game.

3434
03:34:22,030 --> 03:34:24,350
They're just like, what the fuck was that? This game's stupid.

3435
03:34:25,430 --> 03:34:28,950
But like, if you kind of knew like kind of what was going on

3436
03:34:28,950 --> 03:34:34,129
and just like why and I know what's going on, I'm uninstalling afterwards.

3437
03:34:34,729 --> 03:34:38,520
No, you're not.

3438
03:34:38,520 --> 03:34:41,799
And these hit someone.

3439
03:34:41,799 --> 03:34:49,620
Oh, let's fucking go.

3440
03:34:49,620 --> 03:34:55,870
W I got a lot of fucking health.

3441
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:08,719
How many dead skin cells are built up on your mouse buttons?

3442
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:11,479
I clean my mouse all the time, actually, so not very much.

3443
03:35:13,069 --> 03:35:15,940
I'm actually clean my mouse.

3444
03:35:15,940 --> 03:35:17,579
I'm going to check.

3445
03:35:17,579 --> 03:35:18,540
I'm going to validate.

3446
03:35:18,540 --> 03:35:24,620
Go for it.

3447
03:35:24,620 --> 03:35:35,020
All right, let me make my dumb build happen.

3448
03:35:35,020 --> 03:35:44,600
Oh, I'm real. Help, help, help.

3449
03:35:48,309 --> 03:35:53,120
How did that not hit?

3450
03:35:53,120 --> 03:35:54,319
That shot him right in the chest.

3451
03:35:54,319 --> 03:35:59,010
It didn't even do any damage.

3452
03:35:59,010 --> 03:36:03,200
Despite their losing a lot.

3453
03:36:21,379 --> 03:36:24,420
You're real.

3454
03:36:24,420 --> 03:36:27,739
It's the whole frontier payload feels like a spy

3455
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:30,459
all the time when you're on it.

3456
03:36:30,459 --> 03:36:32,459
It's so big. I heard a clunky.

3457
03:36:32,459 --> 03:36:34,139
I heard a

3458
03:36:45,219 --> 03:36:48,379
you got to dodge in real life.

3459
03:36:48,379 --> 03:36:50,780
That guy just blew up into the wall. What?

3460
03:36:50,780 --> 03:36:52,500
That's weird.

3461
03:37:12,510 --> 03:37:16,309
Oh, that was a big crit hit everybody.

3462
03:37:20,809 --> 03:37:23,090
All right. I'm going for the actual heavy now.

3463
03:37:31,969 --> 03:37:34,129
Have you opened any cases or crates or anything?

3464
03:37:34,809 --> 03:37:36,850
Oh, I told you I did.

3465
03:37:36,850 --> 03:37:39,540
But how many? How many?

3466
03:37:39,540 --> 03:37:43,180
Oh, five.

3467
03:37:43,180 --> 03:37:49,680
Whoa. OK, that was more than I thought.

3468
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:58,239
I did not know these windows were here.

3469
03:37:58,239 --> 03:37:59,799
OK, I'm going to try the Liberty launcher.

3470
03:37:59,799 --> 03:38:01,959
You say this is like the best weapon, right?

3471
03:38:01,959 --> 03:38:04,340
Yeah, like pound for pound.

3472
03:38:04,340 --> 03:38:09,540
This is the like, wow.

3473
03:38:09,540 --> 03:38:11,979
Yeah, I don't think anything in the game compares to it.

3474
03:38:11,979 --> 03:38:25,899
OK, that's right.

3475
03:38:25,899 --> 03:38:34,870
I think I jumped into that.

3476
03:38:34,870 --> 03:38:42,229
But I like the sound it makes.

3477
03:38:42,229 --> 03:38:46,100
We're getting this.

3478
03:38:46,100 --> 03:38:53,090
Get out of the way.

3479
03:38:53,090 --> 03:39:00,129
Who's opening the door?

3480
03:39:00,129 --> 03:39:04,659
Where's the sentry up? Sentry's almost gone.

3481
03:39:09,309 --> 03:39:10,389
Oh, there's a second one. Shit.

3482
03:39:10,389 --> 03:39:14,549
You know, it's over there.

3483
03:39:14,549 --> 03:39:19,360
I got it.

3484
03:39:19,360 --> 03:39:27,639
We're the same as how walls go fast.

3485
03:39:34,049 --> 03:39:39,540
Well, this is the door you're talking about.

3486
03:39:39,540 --> 03:39:42,180
Astrology.

3487
03:39:42,180 --> 03:39:44,659
Did you believe in astrology, girl?

3488
03:39:44,659 --> 03:39:49,399
Um, I mean, like stuff like Orion's Belt.

3489
03:39:50,870 --> 03:39:53,909
Like that, there's stars in the sky and that like the universe is real.

3490
03:39:55,020 --> 03:39:58,879
And there's like the universe is expanding and all that.

3491
03:39:58,920 --> 03:40:01,500
Oh, my goodness.

3492
03:40:01,500 --> 03:40:04,870
I lost him.

3493
03:40:04,870 --> 03:40:06,030
I had to pay attention to it.

3494
03:40:06,030 --> 03:40:09,520
I'm sorry. I had crits.

3495
03:40:09,520 --> 03:40:10,520
This is sentry over there.

3496
03:40:10,520 --> 03:40:14,969
OK. Astronomy or astrology?

3497
03:40:15,489 --> 03:40:19,959
Astrology.

3498
03:40:19,959 --> 03:40:22,920
You're talking about like, like,

3499
03:40:24,360 --> 03:40:28,090
ergo and like the Milky Way.

3500
03:40:30,229 --> 03:40:34,159
Um, all of that.

3501
03:40:34,159 --> 03:40:42,200
Um, I mean, I know we have like stars and planets and people gave them

3502
03:40:42,200 --> 03:40:47,319
certain names and certain like attributes.

3503
03:40:47,440 --> 03:40:48,559
I don't know.

3504
03:40:48,559 --> 03:40:52,329
Do you think they gave them bad names?

3505
03:40:52,329 --> 03:40:54,479
What do you mean, bad names?

3506
03:40:54,479 --> 03:40:56,239
I don't think they're bad.

3507
03:40:56,239 --> 03:40:58,600
OK. Yeah, wait, I think you're.

3508
03:40:58,600 --> 03:41:01,200
So you believe in astrology?

3509
03:41:01,200 --> 03:41:03,239
I think you're mixing up two things.

3510
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:09,129
I'm not.

3511
03:41:09,129 --> 03:41:10,370
Astrology is Zodiac.

3512
03:41:10,370 --> 03:41:12,549
Astronomy is stars and shit.

3513
03:41:12,549 --> 03:41:23,989
Zodiac's the killer.

3514
03:41:23,989 --> 03:41:26,729
Liberty launcher.

3515
03:41:26,729 --> 03:41:28,649
How's it serving you?

3516
03:41:28,649 --> 03:41:30,889
I think it's fine.

3517
03:41:30,889 --> 03:41:34,049
I mean, I can't tell anything bad about it.

3518
03:41:40,159 --> 03:41:48,170
Oh, my goodness.

3519
03:41:48,170 --> 03:41:58,219
I didn't kill anybody.

3520
03:41:58,219 --> 03:42:05,459
Why did I do 100 damage to that guy?

3521
03:42:05,459 --> 03:42:08,610
The Liberty launcher sucks.

3522
03:42:08,610 --> 03:42:11,370
Oh, are you trying to get me to use like a weapon that's bad or something?

3523
03:42:11,770 --> 03:42:13,489
I don't think it's bad.

3524
03:42:13,489 --> 03:42:21,049
What's wrong with it?

3525
03:42:21,049 --> 03:42:24,649
Nothing. You trust me or you just a random guy in chat.

3526
03:42:25,450 --> 03:42:27,690
I mean, it's like 20,000 random people.

3527
03:42:35,409 --> 03:42:37,729
Where did that even where did he even shoot that from?

3528
03:42:48,100 --> 03:42:50,100
I'm going to start to like I'm going to start to walk forward

3529
03:42:50,100 --> 03:42:52,219
and then walk backwards and then walk forward again.

3530
03:42:55,459 --> 03:42:57,780
What what was what astrology sign are you?

3531
03:43:00,020 --> 03:43:04,370
Ergo, they're pretty compatible with Leo's.

3532
03:43:05,010 --> 03:43:06,290
Why is that you?

3533
03:43:06,290 --> 03:43:07,610
Is that what this is?

3534
03:43:07,610 --> 03:43:09,090
Is that where this is going?

3535
03:43:09,090 --> 03:43:11,049
Oh, right.

3536
03:43:11,049 --> 03:43:12,729
Would you look at that? OK.

3537
03:43:14,049 --> 03:43:21,090
Oh, hey, I'm going to get you.

3538
03:43:24,110 --> 03:43:25,790
Are you a healer?

3539
03:43:25,790 --> 03:43:27,860
I'm a sniper.

3540
03:43:27,860 --> 03:43:40,430
Sentry down. Cracked out.

3541
03:43:49,579 --> 03:43:52,379
Oh, oh, oh, my hand, my arm.

3542
03:43:52,379 --> 03:43:54,739
Oh, oh, my arm cramped up.

3543
03:43:54,739 --> 03:43:59,379
Oh, gaming hurts that playing video games hurts.

3544
03:43:59,379 --> 03:44:02,219
Dude, my arm is fucking cramped up, dude.

3545
03:44:02,219 --> 03:44:04,659
Hey, bro, my arm cramped up, bro.

3546
03:44:05,540 --> 03:44:09,440
That's why I just walked into the train.

3547
03:44:09,440 --> 03:44:12,469
Hey, bro, it's all good.

3548
03:44:12,469 --> 03:44:21,969

I don't even know what you're screaming about.

3553
03:44:43,770 --> 03:44:45,450
Dude, I didn't hit the wall with the rocket.

3554
03:44:45,450 --> 03:44:47,690

3555
03:44:48,739 --> 03:44:51,899

03:45:08,139 --> 03:45:09,139
I don't walk away.

3559
03:45:09,139 --> 03:45:13,700
We've missed a few too many walk away time.

3560
03:45:13,700 --> 03:45:19,069

3575
03:49:03,479 --> 03:49:12,750

3576
03:49:12,750 --> 03:49:20,500
something for once that was fun my blood was pumping my lungs were breathing air

3577
03:49:20,540 --> 03:49:26,299
I've been too loud today I feel like I'm like yelling a lot I'm yelling over the

3578
03:49:26,299 --> 03:49:38,700
gameplay I think you're good that's good all right what about the engineer

3579
03:49:38,700 --> 03:49:49,860
wrenches would they change it all probably oh boy he doesn't know wasn't

3580
03:49:49,860 --> 03:49:57,020
the Jag always like best in slot almost always that repair rate is yeah pretty

3581
03:49:57,020 --> 03:50:07,319
much repair it's pretty bad though Eureka effect will teleport to the exit now

3582
03:50:07,360 --> 03:50:18,059
the teleporter it's pretty cool everything's like subtly changed where

3583
03:50:18,059 --> 03:50:20,780
it kind of feels like it's the same thing and you just don't remember what

3584
03:50:20,780 --> 03:50:29,459
the right thing actually was that's yeah that's true um let me use the Sandman

3585
03:50:29,459 --> 03:50:36,500
Sandman is cool cuz you go like this no Sam is do not equip the Sandman what

3586
03:50:36,500 --> 03:50:39,979
what do you mean it does not stun anymore it slows and it reduces your

3587
03:50:39,979 --> 03:50:47,190
health by like 15 whoa that is not even close anymore you're right well that's

3588
03:50:47,190 --> 03:50:53,510

3595
03:52:07,069 --> 03:52:21,969
rewinds um centuries right the red tape or I think that was in a long time ago

3596
03:52:21,969 --> 03:52:28,540
though now this is what I'm talking about I actually feel like I'm it's like

3597
03:52:28,540 --> 03:52:36,290
2014 right now like 2015 this is exactly what I was looking for

what else what other was what are you gonna switch the topic that was way

3699
04:09:37,389 --> 04:09:41,750
longer than a minute that was at least five minutes that's the first one today

3700
04:09:41,750 --> 04:09:53,500
because I was very persistent and now Chad's mad that I was persistent how big

do you want a pepperoni you just tickled me hey what the fuck big pepperonis

3702
04:10:03,899 --> 04:10:15,079
kind of creep me out actually true I agree with you on that one and I had

3703
04:10:15,079 --> 04:10:18,639
there's a there's a middle ground because I also had small pepperonis yeah

3704
04:10:18,680 --> 04:10:23,200
and they cook and they like curl up into like moon craters and they just house

3705
04:10:23,200 --> 04:10:28,079
every ounce of grease from the pizza cooking and it's just if you if I eat

3706
04:10:28,079 --> 04:10:34,239
like one or two of them I start feeling like I'm gonna die yeah too many

3707
04:10:34,239 --> 04:10:41,069
pepperonis is yeah I agree especially large pepperonis no I like the really

3708
04:10:41,069 --> 04:10:45,760
small ones because they fit on pizza really well I don't like when the entire

3709
04:10:45,799 --> 04:10:55,520
pizza looks like Kaled no I like when pepperonis they're small and to get it

3710
04:10:55,520 --> 04:10:59,440
at least a few in like every other bite but no no don't get don't turn that

3711
04:10:59,440 --> 04:11:05,079
shit into Kaled no thank you are you a fan of any type of pizza that does not

3712
04:11:05,079 --> 04:11:13,899
use like a mozzarella tomato sauce yeah like a white pizza yeah it can be good

3713
04:11:14,059 --> 04:11:22,969
what's your ultimate alternative pizza um oh let's go hold on this guy's

3714
04:11:22,969 --> 04:11:30,309
friendly uh I don't think there's very many other than that what's another like

3715
04:11:30,309 --> 04:11:34,549
alternative pizza that's like a not mozzarella not traditional hold on I'm

3716
04:11:34,549 --> 04:11:38,469
gonna think about this just just not like tomato sauce oh yeah barbecue

3717
04:11:38,469 --> 04:11:42,020
chickens pretty good I used to have one I can't remember what it was and I'm

3718
04:11:42,020 --> 04:11:46,780
really sad I'm gonna say it randomly and then I would just know that that's what

3719
04:11:46,819 --> 04:11:52,340
I like does buffalo chicken have red sauce on it I think sometimes it depends

3720
04:11:52,340 --> 04:12:01,069
on where you get it I mean the color isn't the relevant component oh I went

3721
04:12:01,069 --> 04:12:10,239
blind I think it was like a garlic piece yeah buffalo chicken pizza is great

3722
04:12:10,239 --> 04:12:14,940
anyway you get it stir looks cute you should compliment him stir apparently

3723
04:12:14,940 --> 04:12:24,329
you look cute right now is that true I don't I don't like the term cute for me

3724
04:12:24,850 --> 04:12:34,780
you know what I mean yeah I feel you I like things like if you call me big and

3725
04:12:34,780 --> 04:12:46,489
chunky and gigantic and huge that's way better that's I'm not a bass that's

3726
04:12:46,489 --> 04:12:56,340
better yeah oh you want to be called big and chunky and huge yes oh I mean I get

3727
04:12:56,379 --> 04:13:00,420
for like working out maybe I get it not even like working out here's the thing

3728
04:13:00,420 --> 04:13:04,079
because if you're like oh you're so cute I feel like it's kind of disingenuous

3729
04:13:04,079 --> 04:13:07,579
and it kind of just glosses over the reality so I'd rather someone

3730
04:13:07,579 --> 04:13:11,899
acknowledge the reality of like you're kind of fucking you're chunky man I'm

3731
04:13:11,899 --> 04:13:16,020
like that's that's really me and I I like me like I don't care I'm a little

3732
04:13:16,020 --> 04:13:19,379
you know but it's like you're acknowledging that about me and I'm

3733
04:13:19,379 --> 04:13:28,600
like yep it's real it feels real you ever just hang out in the pool with your

3738
04:13:58,950 --> 04:14:15,399

fire flamethrower I cannot let you get away with that oh he has a healer now

3747
04:15:28,850 --> 04:15:44,329
if you put pyro vision on oh you should feel like pyro visions the original

3748
04:15:44,329 --> 04:15:58,129
developer intended route what is your favorite movie of all time um it's hard

3749
04:15:58,129 --> 04:16:04,200
to pick one you know everyone's always concerned about favorites through but

3750
04:16:04,200 --> 04:16:10,040
like don't they all have like their own purpose and their own little spot in

3751
04:16:10,040 --> 04:16:13,959
your heart yeah your own little baby boo-boos like I want to watch this one

3752
04:16:13,959 --> 04:16:22,149
blah or I'd like this one for me yeah that's fair get out of here that I have

3753
04:16:22,149 --> 04:16:26,989
like the shortest memory possible for it and I forget movies that I like every

3754
04:16:26,989 --> 04:16:31,149
time I'm asked that question or like there's all the time where a movie will

3755
04:16:31,149 --> 04:16:37,309
come up I'm like oh yeah I do love that movie a lot can't remember it or like if

3756
04:16:37,309 --> 04:16:41,909
I'm just on the spot I think a lot of movies have come out so it's really easy

3757
04:16:41,909 --> 04:16:49,309
to kind of forget some of them even if you really like them yeah how spoiled

3758
04:16:49,309 --> 04:16:52,750
this I've had this thought many times how spoiled are we when we're all like

3759
04:16:52,750 --> 04:17:00,190
I'm so sad and I'm so bored and like I can't even remember all of the great

3760
04:17:00,190 --> 04:17:03,950
media that I love in a single moment I can't even sit here and be like what

3761
04:17:03,950 --> 04:17:08,610
movie do I like I don't fucking I got it's too hard to tell you all of the

3762
04:17:08,610 --> 04:17:15,920
things that are awesome how many games are on Steam I look this upward like

3763
04:17:15,920 --> 04:17:25,110
very recently what is it like 10,000 so you would have to play but that might be

3764
04:17:25,110 --> 04:17:32,139
outdated from like you would have to play like 30 games a day until you were

3765
04:17:32,139 --> 04:17:39,180
dead into if you couldn't play them all why do you want me to die I'm just

3766
04:17:39,180 --> 04:17:53,850
saying there's 50k now yeah I think that the number I saw was like 2018 or

3767
04:17:53,850 --> 04:18:00,360
something over 700,000 games I like bad movies that chattel disagree with me on

3768
04:18:00,360 --> 04:18:07,459
like mother I think mother was an awesome movie mother mother I never saw

3769
04:18:07,459 --> 04:18:14,200
I watched mother with you I love that movie all right let's go movie night

3770
04:18:14,200 --> 04:18:18,319
let's do it and if anyone who knows the movie the guy bouncing on the the

3771
04:18:18,340 --> 04:18:24,620
kitchen counter and she's like come on get off the counter that's like YouTube

3772
04:18:24,620 --> 04:18:32,040
comments to me at that point in my life I was like this guy's a YouTube commenter

3773
04:18:32,040 --> 04:18:40,379
Birdman you seen Birdman I have yeah it's great great movie come on we do it

3774
04:18:40,379 --> 04:18:46,379
again we can do another fucking movie four more movies in a row all these

3775
04:18:46,379 --> 04:18:52,909
idiots all these morons don't know what we're really capable of doing movies

3776
04:18:52,909 --> 04:19:03,840
about me I am Birdman you are Birdman I don't like there I don't like the ending

3777
04:19:03,840 --> 04:19:09,770
I had can in a different ending and they did rewrite the ending like we're

3778
04:19:09,770 --> 04:19:16,739
leaving right we're leaving yeah I just think Birdman is one of those movies

3779
04:19:16,739 --> 04:19:21,719
that the style of trying to shoot something pretending that it's all

3780
04:19:21,860 --> 04:19:27,639
essentially happening in a row even if it's not happening it still takes a lot

3781
04:19:27,639 --> 04:19:34,420
to get that to happen and make any sense it's like a great piece of cinema it's

3782
04:19:34,420 --> 04:19:43,459
very good it's it is like what I would describe for like a true movie like this

3783
04:19:43,459 --> 04:19:59,930
is a real movie this is a piece of cinema hidden cuts yeah that's fine

3784
04:19:59,930 --> 04:20:04,579
though there are at least a few times when Michael Keaton's walking around

3785
04:20:04,579 --> 04:20:09,629
going from space to space without a cut that even let me tell you something

3786
04:20:09,930 --> 04:20:15,159
coming from the YouTube world where you have to go like this you know what I

3787
04:20:15,159 --> 04:20:17,760
mean think about like the like all the YouTube videos ever seen and like I've

3788
04:20:17,760 --> 04:20:23,250
done this I do this all time this shit where it's like hey everybody welcome to

3789
04:20:23,250 --> 04:20:28,280
hey yeah we're back and here's another cut and oh and I fucked that up do it

3790
04:20:28,280 --> 04:20:36,600
again so at the end of the day the most important thing is to make sure that as

3791
04:20:36,600 --> 04:20:43,100
we go forward as a species we should always drink water right like it's almost

3792
04:20:43,100 --> 04:20:47,319
it's hard to actually go in the first half and we should drink water is where

3793
04:20:47,319 --> 04:20:52,229
I picked up as a species yes we should always drink water I agree yes but my

3794
04:20:52,229 --> 04:20:57,579
point is is that the youtuber shit where we cut every five to twelve seconds

3795
04:20:57,579 --> 04:21:04,500
because we don't remember what we're gonna say what's wrong with that it's

3796
04:21:04,500 --> 04:21:07,059
I'm just saying it's hard it's hard to go right in a row you know who does this

3797
04:21:07,059 --> 04:21:13,299
really well you know let me tell you something me no oh damn well you know

3798
04:21:13,299 --> 04:21:16,379
actually I think you're pretty good at this too but you know who's really

3799
04:21:16,520 --> 04:21:21,659
really good at this you one take is so fucking good at this and I don't even

3800
04:21:21,659 --> 04:21:27,180
know how the fuck he does it is Ludwig Ludwig will do like a 20 minute video

3801
04:21:27,180 --> 04:21:34,430
where he does not miss a single beat not a single beat and it's all one take I

3802
04:21:34,430 --> 04:21:39,719
don't even know how he does it it's actually a talent it's truly is and he

3803
04:21:39,719 --> 04:21:44,719
it's not like he's stopping he is full-on explaining something talking

3804
04:21:44,719 --> 04:21:48,719
addressing the camera it's fucking crazy what he does he can do it in one take

3805
04:21:49,579 --> 04:21:52,379
you probably would like Ludwig you guys should meet you you probably like them

3806
04:21:52,379 --> 04:22:02,440
versus sax and Hale yes no yeah why not let's try it well I think we have to

3807
04:22:02,440 --> 04:22:08,219
wait for this round done I will try to do that and I'll get like 30 seconds in

3808
04:22:08,219 --> 04:22:18,329
and be like fuck me and have to start the whole thing over again all if I do

3809
04:22:18,329 --> 04:22:23,899
it I feel like the video would be better if I didn't do it yeah but you do it

3810
04:22:23,899 --> 04:22:29,030
anyways you start over anyways there's been a couple times right like start

3811
04:22:29,049 --> 04:22:32,610
over multiple times and then I feel like I get one take because I've just said it

3812
04:22:32,610 --> 04:22:38,120
like eight times in a row yeah but even then I still think it would just like

3813
04:22:38,120 --> 04:22:44,159
why not cut why not cut like a second or two of dead space and that like you

3814
04:22:44,159 --> 04:22:48,940
know and also too if you'd go through one thing in one take there's a huge

3815
04:22:48,940 --> 04:22:54,059
possibility that you somewhere in that like five straight minutes you said

3816
04:22:54,059 --> 04:23:01,079
something that wasn't correct and it's like god damn it you left yeah okay

3817
04:23:01,079 --> 04:23:08,620
I realized it in one place sax and Hale. I love that was your idea and you're like nah never mind

3818
04:23:08,620 --> 04:23:15,790
well it put us in there and then you know but like getting something wrong in

3819
04:23:15,790 --> 04:23:20,110
the middle of a commentary like that or a talking like that then you you watch

3820
04:23:20,110 --> 04:23:23,590
it back and like wow I did pretty good job one take oh the thing I said at two

3821
04:23:23,590 --> 04:23:28,950
minutes is completely fucking wrong now what do I do just take a little cut and

3822
04:23:28,950 --> 04:23:34,690
put it in there and leave the rest or is that weird I mean is he I haven't seen

3823
04:23:35,110 --> 04:23:40,760
his videos is he full on camera 100% of the video or does like yeah it's so

3824
04:23:40,760 --> 04:23:45,200
he'll do like mobile mails or does something go over him where he can do

3825
04:23:45,200 --> 04:23:49,520
like a fake cut no I don't think so I think he just does it he just goes for

3826
04:23:49,520 --> 04:24:01,270
it man what a legend stop trying to make your boss sound good dude he is good he

3827
04:24:01,270 --> 04:24:08,770
is good what do you want to pretend he's not that's weird that's weirder that's

3828
04:24:08,770 --> 04:24:25,379
weirder for me to pretend that he's not I mean he I would say I think he is the

3829
04:24:25,379 --> 04:24:38,670
most attractive youtuber here we go again you cute us right yeah we're cute

3830
04:24:38,670 --> 04:24:44,079
all right good uh did you did you have a favorite movie you want to toss your

3831
04:24:44,079 --> 04:24:53,329
hat in gremlins 2 I'm about I'm hovering over the leave game I just I'm

3832
04:24:53,329 --> 04:25:05,889
threatening to leave the game explain why you just left I'll click it it's a

3833
04:25:05,889 --> 04:25:11,969
mixture of like shocking wow gremlins 2 is his favorite movie but then also like

3834
04:25:11,969 --> 04:25:20,520
it's funny cuz it fits yeah I feel like if you had the opportunity to have a pet

3835
04:25:20,520 --> 04:25:31,829
mug why you would gremlinify it because you think the gremlins are cuter he

3836
04:25:31,829 --> 04:25:41,239
gets it if you if you think that the gremlins are cute is that is that

3837
04:25:41,239 --> 04:25:46,790
appropriate I just think okay the gremlins to me are looney toons

3838
04:25:46,790 --> 04:25:51,770
characters they go from being these like cute little oh it's such a cute little

3839
04:25:51,770 --> 04:25:57,129
like kitten it's a cute little puppy to turning into a looney toons daffy duck

3840
04:25:57,129 --> 04:26:01,840
character I mean I like the looney toons daffy duck character more than

3841
04:26:01,840 --> 04:26:11,819
the like cute one I find that to be more interesting to me exactly full circle

3842
04:26:11,819 --> 04:26:14,819
that's why I don't want to be called cute and I'd rather be called a full tub

3843
04:26:14,819 --> 04:26:23,139
of jiff extra chunky peanut butter I feel it I'm gonna do you want to be the

3844
04:26:23,139 --> 04:26:26,420
cute gremlin or you want to be the cool gremlin I want to be the gremlin that

3845
04:26:26,420 --> 04:26:32,889
talks because that's the best one the one that sings New York New York I

3846
04:26:37,469 --> 04:26:43,170
disagree completely oh you would want you would be the vegetable one wouldn't

3847
04:26:43,170 --> 04:26:48,409
you oh my I don't like it when there's a show where one Pokemon Meowth in the

3848
04:26:48,409 --> 04:26:52,010
whole world learns how to talk no but it's not that way have you seen

3849
04:26:52,010 --> 04:27:00,520
gremlins to probably like 30 years ago before I was born okay he didn't learn

3850
04:27:00,520 --> 04:27:06,719
how to talk he drank a fucking potion in a weird lab that gave that grew his

3851
04:27:06,719 --> 04:27:11,059
brain it that he didn't learn how to talk he drank a potion that made him

3852
04:27:11,059 --> 04:27:20,809
smarter and there was only one potion to drink of course there was only one

3853
04:27:20,809 --> 04:27:30,479
potion to drink oh my goodness that's a lot of people yes it is oh he went rage

3872
04:30:39,120 --> 04:30:47,139
hats for the keys what is considered the the unusual now like what is like the

3873
04:30:47,139 --> 04:30:55,100
best one now any idea no clue I have never had any comprehension of the

3874
04:30:55,100 --> 04:31:00,649
unusual market after it like like ancient times it was like the green flame

3875
04:31:00,649 --> 04:31:04,909
and then once they started adding more I had no idea anymore people are still

3876
04:31:04,909 --> 04:31:11,840
saying ones yeah burning team captain oh okay I guess I still know damn really

3877
04:31:11,840 --> 04:31:17,600
even after all the updates no no new one is come on crates are rarer because

3878
04:31:17,600 --> 04:31:26,239
they're old it's true it's rare okay do you want it right when the door opens or

3884
04:32:40,139 --> 04:32:44,979
the momentum that we're driving for our team right now oh he's the real power

3885

right here there's way too I'm fucking running back spawn dude there's a

3887
04:33:00,280 --> 04:33:10,040
century in the water at our spawn what I got it

3888
04:33:10,040 --> 04:33:19,950
oh yeah they can't shoot out of the water so they only kill desperate losers

3889

Liberty launcher is insane I don't even have to worry about it getting

3892
04:33:43,779 --> 04:33:49,729
reflected because it won't do any damage so is that is it bad and you that's the

3893
04:33:49,729 --> 04:33:53,270
thing what do you I feel like you're tearing in two different directions

3894
04:33:53,270 --> 04:34:02,029
there I believe in it I'm a believer I think it was no one believes in it it

3895
04:34:02,029 --> 04:34:06,549
does a lot less damage but someone at long range it scales down to 18 damage

3896
04:34:06,549 --> 04:34:12,650
oh that's why I was doing like 30 damage right yes oh this is scary there's a lot

04:40:41,270 --> 04:40:49,959

3927
04:40:49,959 --> 04:41:03,759
came out oh no yeah okay I had to see outsider you know what I'm gonna be the

3928
04:41:03,759 --> 04:41:13,009
dead ringer guy when I die I'm just gonna play spy as a scout with a revolver

3929
04:41:13,009 --> 04:41:27,069
and just be immune to dying smart what is there somebody in the water so you're

3930
04:41:27,430 --> 04:41:51,840

3931
04:41:51,840 --> 04:42:05,069
just do that no I just spawned and didn't get to do anything yet there you

3932
04:42:05,069 --> 04:42:12,720
go oh jeez love what does the happy camper on

3933

sniper do these days no no lynching and yeah you get healed that's the big thing

3934
04:42:20,909 --> 04:42:39,590
you get healed for health every couple seconds I think pretty damn good shit

3935
04:42:39,709 --> 04:42:45,959
adjust your view model so we can see the goddamn game that's cuz I'm using the

3936
04:42:45,959 --> 04:43:05,479
rainbow thing I like it big same yeah I like it this games about to be over in

3937
04:43:05,479 --> 04:43:11,099
like two seconds are you all the way back there no I just feel like we're

3938
04:43:11,099 --> 04:43:42,000
rolling I'm just this is just bubbles everywhere guys running all over the

3939
04:43:42,000 --> 04:44:18,740
place we re queuing or what are you relieving can we do can we do one or

3940
04:44:18,740 --> 04:44:27,369
two on bunker hill no you haven't even done cell bling yet which one do you

3941
04:44:27,369 --> 04:44:32,759
like out of all them so everyone's gonna want you to experience saving okay

3942
04:44:32,759 --> 04:44:39,349
let's do it it's like the map from the update and I'm shocked it hasn't I even

3943
04:44:39,349 --> 04:44:43,029
tried to queue into it exclusively before I wasn't doing it I typically

3944
04:44:43,029 --> 04:44:50,630
always get it didn't they nerf the pumps and lay into the ground at one point I

3945
04:44:50,630 --> 04:44:59,419
guess I don't even remember what that thing does we play different I'm not an

3946
04:44:59,419 --> 04:45:05,259
engineer you really don't play it right and I don't play engineer I don't play

3947
04:45:05,259 --> 04:45:13,330
your your your spy very much your your medic so this is the one that when you

3948
04:45:13,330 --> 04:45:17,409
hit somebody with it the medic will lose up to ten percent in Medigun charge

3949
04:45:17,889 --> 04:45:28,310
really doesn't seem that bad I don't remember it having the on-hit victim

3950
04:45:28,310 --> 04:45:40,599
loses cloak it feels new but again I would not remember I'll try the short

3951
04:45:40,599 --> 04:45:43,599
circuit so now it's actually a projectile is not like electricity that

3952
04:45:43,599 --> 04:45:51,880
comes out of your hand so alt fire just what is the regular fire do anything

3953
04:45:51,880 --> 04:46:05,369
you know it still is electricity okay bro this is the worst loadout I could

3954
04:46:05,369 --> 04:46:18,840
possibly have well let's try to make it work why not what's your secondary

3955
04:46:18,840 --> 04:46:26,909
Thompson short-circuit and the Jag is that the worst possible engineer load

3956
04:46:26,909 --> 04:46:33,520
up I don't know the Jag seems intelligent that's wrong I could put on

3957
04:46:33,520 --> 04:46:44,259
the Eureka effect put on the Wrangler what is so bad about this actually it

3958
04:46:44,259 --> 04:46:48,840
looks like they buff the Eureka effect all like a lot I remember just being

3959
04:46:48,840 --> 04:46:54,439
kind of quirky that's your reload key to choose to teleport to spawn or your exit

3960
04:46:54,439 --> 04:47:01,299
teleporter minus 50% metal cost when constructing or upgrading oh that's

3961
04:47:01,380 --> 04:47:09,790
actually kind of good guys we can't get a cell blown in server they just don't

3962
04:47:09,790 --> 04:47:17,240
exist I'll try it don't use the pumps and you'd be better off turning your

3963
04:47:17,240 --> 04:47:26,169
monitor off and playing the game with your face Wow why they're doubting you

3964
04:47:26,169 --> 04:47:32,880
they are you can handle it they are doubting big-time yeah what did you

3965
04:47:32,880 --> 04:47:39,439
kiss you I'm trying to get us in the sale begin there we go I'm gonna I'm

3966
04:47:39,439 --> 04:47:42,759
gonna go get like a water after this my voice is like drying up I feel like I'm

3967
04:47:42,799 --> 04:47:48,720
gonna cough dust out in a second hmm so this maps is this maps a little bit

3968
04:47:48,720 --> 04:47:53,619
different this is a little bit of a mixture of Call of Duty's kill confirmed

3969
04:47:53,619 --> 04:48:00,759
with a zoo okay so what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna kill enemy

3970
04:48:00,759 --> 04:48:06,080
players and pick up fish but and then when the seal appears you want to feed

3971
04:48:06,080 --> 04:48:13,509
the seal the fish you collect okay I'm gonna play something else you already

3972
04:48:13,549 --> 04:48:24,119
gave up just not engineer I don't know what the hell's going on Wow so get

3973
04:48:24,119 --> 04:48:31,950
kills pick up seals pick up fish feed the fish to the seal okay and if you are

3974
04:48:31,950 --> 04:48:39,880
the leader if you hold the most fish then you will um you become a dispenser

3975
04:48:39,880 --> 04:48:44,119
effect for your team and the enemy team can like see where you are through wall

3976
04:48:44,119 --> 04:48:55,779
oh at the bottom left it'll if maybe I don't know your HUD if you see like a

3977
04:48:55,779 --> 04:49:02,090
random floating number those are people who have the fish I like that little

3978
04:49:02,090 --> 04:49:11,729
truck oh our seal is swimming around it's everybody's seal everybody needs to

3979
04:49:11,729 --> 04:49:16,409
feed the seal oh and the seal is an eldritch old god and it favors whichever

3980
04:49:16,409 --> 04:49:19,970
team feeds it more and then it banishes the other team from this mortal coil

3981
04:49:19,970 --> 04:49:30,029
which is the only part I've made up but it's the only reason why we'd be feeding the

3982
04:49:30,029 --> 04:50:00,580
seal and fighting over it oh shit no the medic was still there I don't get it at

3983
04:50:00,580 --> 04:50:07,479
all but I think I after a round or two I'll get it oh yeah it really is just

3984
04:50:07,479 --> 04:50:15,520
like it's not you'll see because the seal isn't always active so like right

3985
04:50:15,520 --> 04:50:20,000
now he's doing three two one seal feed the seal so that guy's 20th okay I get

3986
04:50:20,000 --> 04:50:24,619
it yeah yep yep you got to kill that guy and get that guy's fish because he's

3987
04:50:24,659 --> 04:50:52,560
feeding the fish pretty hard right now oh shit spy we're all the way back to the

3988
04:50:52,560 --> 04:51:00,770
spawn kind of well you got to feed this thing oh there we go who's got the most

3989
04:51:00,770 --> 04:51:22,330
fish it's by as by I got a banner I got a banner dude come on I feel like every

3990
04:51:22,330 --> 04:51:27,270
time I'm about to do click a good thing I get backstabbed every time maybe you

3991
04:51:27,270 --> 04:51:36,880
should look behind you I did maybe you should dude maybe you shouldn't be

3992
04:51:36,880 --> 04:51:55,419
streaming what the fuck that's a fucking spy right there guarantee it yeah he's

3993
04:51:55,419 --> 04:52:07,040
still alive he's not you don't he's he's like writer you see the guy with 11 you

3994
04:52:07,040 --> 04:52:14,720
gotta get these 11 oh my god I'm just gonna play pyro never change ever I feel

3995
04:52:14,720 --> 04:52:27,790
like I get I get I can play the game if I play pyro ooh this is cool okay we

3996
04:52:27,790 --> 04:52:40,750
gotta feed the steel steel time he comes out of the van seals and you have

3997
04:52:40,750 --> 04:52:50,040
to play the objective I'm surprised I didn't get that but I stopped spinning

3998
04:52:50,040 --> 04:53:21,580
so angry I got him okay how did they nerf the dead ringer when this shit

3999
04:53:21,580 --> 04:53:35,630
fucking disciplinary action whips you out of the danger zone how is that nerf

4000
04:53:35,630 --> 04:53:45,479
sounds like a skill issue to me well I'm using it right now that's how I noticed

4001
04:53:45,599 --> 04:53:58,650
insane it actually uh heavy is probably the worst possible thing to do but I'm

4002
04:53:58,650 --> 04:54:58,919
gonna do it give me that snack all right do I think I have it damn he got me Wow

4003
04:54:58,919 --> 04:55:12,790
I thought there's gonna be a spy right behind me there is turn around don't do

4004
04:55:12,790 --> 04:55:28,060
that I really thought you were serious I did see one what is going on I'm bad

4005
04:55:28,060 --> 04:55:45,919
focus just aim just actually aim that's a lot of fish there's no way wait drop

4006
04:55:45,919 --> 04:56:09,759
an item I think I'm safe I'm so not used to being able to feign death and cheat

4007
04:56:09,759 --> 04:56:19,869
life itself but I didn't do it oh I keep forgetting that I'm allowed to cheat I

4008
04:56:19,869 --> 04:57:09,930
think the sniper is the spy but it's this guy get out of here we good this

4009
04:57:09,930 --> 04:57:24,040
guy's got 29 holy shit

4010
04:57:28,729 --> 04:57:41,119
what is wrong with you we did it we're having a crisis you're having a meltdown

4011
04:57:41,119 --> 04:57:56,970
I keep getting killed by spies hey we did pretty good that was a good round we

4012
04:57:56,970 --> 04:58:04,830
won yeah I'd say pretty good is what you say when you lose but we actually won I

4013
04:58:06,650 --> 04:58:12,049
like in a spy I'm forgetting that I'm allowed to cheat death and and I keep

4014
04:58:12,049 --> 04:58:35,759
dying you're one of these people is a spy I'm certain of it hmm I think we

4015
04:58:35,759 --> 04:58:44,259
might need a little bit if I kind of need to see how bad the ambassador is now

4016
04:58:44,259 --> 04:58:54,979
for myself isn't the default revolver like it's really good it's it's pretty

4017
04:58:54,979 --> 04:59:04,500
good but it gets like random bullets spread after a shot and I just want to

4018
04:59:04,500 --> 04:59:40,080
aim it ahead god damn it 14 fishes all right this is where the fuck is that

4019
04:59:40,080 --> 04:59:47,700
spy knew it I knew I was like where the fuck did he go I don't want to do I

4020
04:59:47,700 --> 05:00:04,830
think I'm yeah I'm going for it I'm just gonna play it with the is a

4021
05:00:04,830 --> 05:00:14,189
teleporter evenness probably yeah not really not really on this map it helps

4022
05:00:14,189 --> 05:00:25,099
but it's not the most important thing on kind of close what's really important

4023
05:00:25,099 --> 05:01:27,889
is feeding this seal I guess I'll play pyro yay I was gonna tape my fucking

4024
05:01:27,889 --> 05:01:50,020
left mouse button down I'm bad at it I am bad at this one I didn't want to do

4025
05:01:50,020 --> 05:02:17,369
that give me a fucking break it's so not worth it I believe everyone okay let's

4029
05:03:26,020 --> 05:03:32,159
to step it up I'm trying I mean the game's pretty even we don't really

4030
05:03:32,159 --> 05:04:32,970

4031
05:04:32,970 --> 05:05:11,069
me those fishes see I'm gonna go on another run a dungeon run dude that's

4032
05:05:11,069 --> 05:05:18,880
some pretty nasty thunder I was like what the fuck is that sound that was

4033
05:05:18,880 --> 05:05:27,229
some pretty bad thunder yeah yeah in real life I saw a flash out my fucking

4034
05:05:27,229 --> 05:05:31,520
I was like what the hell is that and then the thunder rolled in that's why I

4035
05:05:31,520 --> 05:05:37,119
don't stop playing how often do you get like storms in Vegas um it happens

4036
05:05:37,119 --> 05:05:40,720
pretty frequently especially in summertime not a lot of rain but we'll

4037
05:05:40,720 --> 05:05:58,740
