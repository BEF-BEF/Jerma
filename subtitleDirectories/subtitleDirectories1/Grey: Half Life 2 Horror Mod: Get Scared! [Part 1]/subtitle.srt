1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,719
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirva here with Scare Saturdays.

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:10,460
I know it's been quite a long time since you've seen a Scare Saturdays. It's been at least,

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,619
god I don't know, maybe three or four weeks since I've done a real Scare Saturdays video.

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:20,379
And if you didn't notice, I'm not in my typical place right now. This is a hotel room.

5
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:25,899
And if you saw my last video, I'm currently not in North Carolina. I'm in Virginia right now.

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:30,940
It is my sister's 30th birthday party. I was actually, I was gonna get her up here

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,820
to like get in front of the camera, but she was like, no. So that's not happening.

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,939
So let's just get right into this here. I'm gonna play Grey, which is a Half-Life 2 Episode 2 mod.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,020
And let's get started. I heard really, really good things about this game. Heard it is terrifying.

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,899
And also, before we really get started, this is not my typical setup. I'm using my laptop's webcam

11
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:59,500
and this $10 microphone that I got at Staples like an hour ago. So if the audio quality and

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,659
the video quality is not what you're used to, then I do apologize for that. But it's what I'm

13
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,099
working with. It's all I got right now. So let's just start a new game. Are you sure you want to

14
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:21,219
start a new game? Uh, yeah. Let's start it. Pickle tea. I can't even pick hard, so normal.

15
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:33,670
All right, let's go. Door open. Hi, door. What the hell is that? What the hell is going on?

16
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:43,129
I hear noises. Oh, what on earth? What is this? Like a head shrinker? What's going on here?

17
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:52,540
Can I open this? I don't think I can open that. Oh, my God. That guy's got a knife. That guy's

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:00,709
got a knife, man. Oh, my God. This is, I don't even want to go down this hallway.

19
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:18,699
This guy's just got a knife. He's going to tell you. I guess we go in here. Am I falling down?

20
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:30,680
Do I have a flashlight? No. What the hell? What have you done? I don't know. What have you done?

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,159
You're running around like a freak. Reminds me of Nightmare House. It's the girl running in front

22
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:41,349
of you, scaring the absolute crap out of you. Can I close the door, please? Blood all over the walls,

23
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:52,219
which is never a good thing. Hey! Am I? Do I have the same hair color? Do I have the same

24
00:02:52,219 --> 00:03:02,419
facial features? Wow. This is very, very morbid. This is terrifying, guys. The atmosphere of this

25
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:10,500
game is really just absolutely terrifying. Whoa. This is some art deco going on here.

26
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:23,139
What is that? What is that thing? What on earth is this? If this thing touches me, do I get hurt?

27
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:34,789
Oh my god. I feel like I'm in a haunted house. Get me the hell away from these things. Do I get

28
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:44,520
like a weapon eventually or something? I hope so. And we're going down the checkerboard hallway,

29
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,000
where it looks like it's going to be forever. X. Touch that. Oh, I already knew what I had to do.

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,759
I already knew what I had to do right there. That's how much of a pro I am.

31
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:04,500
What is it? Are there more X's that I have to hit? I guess so. There's plenty of them. Let's push

32
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:18,149
them all, baby. Okay. That's all of them, right? I think so. I think so. Oh, no. No, we missed one.

33
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:30,740
We missed one. I just heard the unlock sound. There we go. God. This is just, this is just awful.

34
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:38,569
Like just disgusting and ridiculous. I'd hate to be that guy. Oh,

35
00:04:41,750 --> 00:05:07,589
this is the creepiest game I've ever played. Oh, oh my god. Holy god. That was my whole brain.

36
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:12,600
You know, when like your brain, when things just like snap and you feel like you just got hit by

37
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,899
a car, but you're sitting in a desk and you're fine. That's, I just feel like I got hit by a car.

38
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:33,850
Wow. All right. Now where the hell are we? All right. So I'm dating that girl

39
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,470
and she doesn't like me anymore. I don't think that's the right character.

40
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,579
I feel like something's gonna jump in my face right now. Oh, is this just,

41
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:53,959
oh, okay. So I am this guy. All right. Let's go, man. Toilet. Gotta take a dump. Hold on.

42
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:59,379
Excuse me. I don't want anyone to look at me while I'm taking a dump. Can we please

43
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:06,199
close the stall door, please? Let's go. What the, what the hell?

44
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:15,939
How come I have hands now? I didn't have hands before. Make sure I'm not missing anything here.

45
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:23,269
I'm, I've been known to just miss things. Okay. This is cut scene.

46
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:35,379
Currently in some weird room. My face is pulsing. Whatever. Where is everyone? Did they close up?

47
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,939
Voice acting. Pretty cool. Hold tab periodically to see your current objective.

48
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,500
Figure out where everyone is. That's pretty vague. What should I do? I wonder where everybody is.

49
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:57,689
Find everybody. That's malarkey. Oh, swear word. Swear word. Cut it off.

50
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,019
Maybe I'll find something useful in the tool shop down the alley.

51
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,500
Really? You could have told me I could have needed that. Can I like just call somebody on the phone?

52
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,079
I'm going to call somebody on the phone. Let me get, let me get some help from burger boy here.

53
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:21,910
Burger boy? Yeah, it's Jerma. How the hell do I get out of here? All right. Where is it?

54
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,949
Did I like walk by it? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Is that like a saw? Can I pick up the saw?

55
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,629
Can I pick up the saw? No, I can't pick up the saw. Of course I can.

56
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,680
They're both. What am I supposed to do here? This is like, this is the tool shed, isn't it?

57
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,819
I see a saw right here. I should be able to pick that up and like throw it at somebody.

58
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,980
All right. No map. Don't know where the hell I'm going, but you know, we're going to get there

59
00:07:50,980 --> 00:08:00,920
eventually. What happened to this door? All right. This looks like it's a repair shop. I see a car.

60
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:09,350
Or did I just come out the same way I went in? Oh, I totally did. All right. Hey, you learn

61
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:19,699
something every day. Where, where has my little. Oh, there we go. What does that say? Tool shop.

62
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:29,620
Yes, I will open that door. Yes, I will. I'm looking for some tools. If you got any tools,

63
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:37,399
I'll take them. I'll take one of the monies in the register too. Ooh, found it. Excellent.

64
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:47,110
Excellent. A bolt cutter. Let's go open that door. Let's go open that freaking door. Hold on. Let

65
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,309
me take a drink of my delicious water. Let me take a sip of my delicious water. Let's go.

66
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:07,210
It was this way. I think I remember. I think it was this way. I've been wrong before and I

67
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:16,730
am totally wrong. I wish there was a sprint. I'm kind of just like, I'm going to meet my maker.

68
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:25,220
Let's go meet the maker. We're going to meet the maker. I'm going back the way I came.

69
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:34,659
Meet your maker. Meet your maker. Burger Boy's Baker. Meet your maker. Meet your maker.

70
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:41,379
Meet your maker. Where is Burger Boy's Baker. All right. That's enough of that. I keep on going in

71
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,779
like the same. I'm literally going back and forth in the same directions. I need to like pay attention

72
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:52,549
to the game. Too busy making like a song about Burger Boy. Can I go in here? Nope, I can't.

73
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,700
That's this is the way. This is the way. No, this is the way over here.

74
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:11,350
Yeah, right. Yeah, right. This is the way, right? I'm so confused. Yes. Excellent. Excellent. Let's

75
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:19,100
go. Cutscene. Tip. Don't forget some useful gray key bindings such as mouse two for iron sights.

76
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:27,220
There's iron sights in this game? H to open memos and tap for eject. Okay. So apparently this is

77
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:35,559
like Call of Duty Half-Life 2 mod episode horror Modern Warfare Black Ops 4. Let's go. Oh, frame

78
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,840
rate. Oh my God. I'm getting a bad frame rate here. I'm getting like eight frames a second.

79
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:55,350
Here we go. What you got for me in here? What you got for me in here? Why can I not pick this up?

80
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:05,049
I think this flashlight has batteries. Does it have batteries? Yeah, it does. All right.

81
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:16,070
Let's kick this off here. Let's go. Oh, we love this. It's jammed. There's an arrow pointing that

82
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:29,700
way. So I'm going to go this way. Don't know what that is, but I just picked it up. What about in

83
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:38,279
here? Ooh, back outside. Every single door is locked and now I'm at a dead end. Where am I supposed

84
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,419
to put it? What can I turn on the AC? It's getting hot in here. Kind of is getting hot in here in real

85
00:11:44,419 --> 00:12:01,429
life. Oh, okay. Through block 12. Sounds easy enough. Okay. Through block 12. I'm going to push

86
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:20,970
all this stuff over. Why am I stuck in here? Oh, through block 12. I have no idea where I'm supposed

87
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:30,039
to go. Block 12. It could be any of these jammed up doors. Is it like a trap door? No. Actually,

88
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:44,629
kind of is. This door I dropped. Well, definitely not in the storage room. I don't know. I just

89
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:55,220
don't know, guys. What the hell is that? This guy's going to turn around. He's going to run at me.

90
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:08,259
He didn't run at me. That makes me happy. He's probably going to be behind me now and I'm going

91
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,620
to be scared and I'm going to freak out because he's going to be right behind me. Go, go, go, go,

92
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,950
go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I thought these things were bad guys, were like scary ghosts,

93
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:26,710
but they're just pillars in the ground. Oh man. Fine with me. Every door is locked. Don't expect

94
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:47,269
to. That thing had long arms. That was like a slender man. Woman. Oh damn it. God. That's

95
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:52,860
supposed to be my mother. This is horrible. Hey mom, sorry I was late for school that one time.

96
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:59,429
Don't like rip out my eyeballs and feed them to me. Where was I going this way? Where like mommy

97
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:14,600
went? I heard something. I hate these little enclosed person. It is a person. This is where

98
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,450
it starts to get really messed up. Oh damn it. I hate when it gets like this. He's going to like

99
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:34,250
stand up and pee on me. Okay. There's a key. Let me go. Come on. Let's go. Give me the key and give

100
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,960
me his label for the back exit. I've got to hurry. How'd that guy die? Anyways, can I like, no, I

101
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:52,059
can't go over there. Oh, this way. Oh, I don't want to see this. I don't want to see this thing

102
00:14:52,059 --> 00:15:11,210
again. It's like slender woman. Turn my flashlight back on. All right. Sick radio. I don't care about

103
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:17,049
your dumb radio. Let's take a bath. Wash away the hatred I have. Anything in the fridge? Any like

104
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:24,570
burgers? I'm just, I'm delaying right now. I'm stalling because I don't want to see that thing

105
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:49,100
again. Can I go this way? Yeah, there's nothing in here. Nothing in here. The stairs. I don't

106
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,700
remember going up the stairs, so I'll go down them. That's fine with me. Any hidden stuff? No.

107
00:15:55,659 --> 00:16:15,879
There's the key. Cutscene. Batteries increase your flashlight's field of view while also reducing

108
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:28,629
its chance to flicker temporarily. Good to know. Good to know. All right. Let's end episode one

109
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:32,470
right here. Phil, I've been playing for a little while now. I can try and get this out into one

110
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:39,110
episode. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And if you, did you hear

111
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,389
that? If you want to see more Gray, let me know. If you guys want to leave a like on the video or

112
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,549
a comment or something, just let me know if you want to see more of this because I heard it gets,

113
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,990
it can get pretty difficult later on. So if you just want to see the intro, which is the

114
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,029
thing that in the very beginning, which is really screwed up if you ask me, yeah, just let me know

115
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,549
and I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care everybody.
