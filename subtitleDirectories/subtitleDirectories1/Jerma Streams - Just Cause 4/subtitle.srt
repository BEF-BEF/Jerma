1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:13,769
Oh, there's no sound. Oops. Hey. That was awkward. Hey, hi guys. Welcome to the stream.

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:23,879
You guys could just hear my mouth open. That's what it sounds like when there's no

3
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:41,609
background sounds or audio. This is what you hear. That's, no, like, you can't hear that now,

4
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:49,740
that this is on. Like, I just did it and you didn't hear it. Fucking magic of audio mixing.

5
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,859
Anyways, uh, how you guys doing? Hope you had a good couple of days there,

6
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:03,020
after the green screen movie night. Hope all is well. My camera's on. Oh, better turn it off.

7
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:11,819
Tonight we're gonna play Just Cause 4 and then tomorrow, uh, if it's allowed, we're going to

8
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:20,019
re-stream the game awards and, you know, maybe give a little j- couple of jabs every now and again.

9
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:33,930
And then after that, the plan is for, uh, potentially this weekend, Saturday and Sunday,

10
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:42,980
to be Dreamcast. I'm gonna get that ready to go if I can. So that is the plan for this week.

11
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:56,379
Okay, but what about Lego Island? All things, all things will happen eventually. It can't be

12
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:06,659
Lego Island every single stream, you know? I would love nothing more than to have it be Lego Island

13
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:14,280
every stream. But I'm sorry, guys. It's just not the way it works. So let's move over here.

14
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:22,310
Uh, Just Cause 4, it's just, I heard it was interesting. That's what I heard.

15
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:29,030
You know, might not be true. It's currently sitting at a very great, mostly negative on

16
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:41,060
Steam. I don't know why. But it is. And here it is right now. That's because it sucks.

17
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:59,819
All right, well, let's, well, just how much does it suck? Just Cause you can doesn't mean that you

18
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:11,539
should. But I mean, look, we have to try stuff. Okay? This stream is a fucking first impressions

19
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,939
journalistic approach to most video games, right? Like, we have to get, we have to do it.

20
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:28,300
Oh, the game is starting.

21
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:32,139
Up to this point, his whereabouts have been unknown since our withdrawal from Medici.

22
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:35,340
I thought that was actually responsible for deposing half a dozen heads of state.

23
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,419
The black hands have encountered them before. Anybody give a shit about any of this? Like,

24
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,099
I could just skip this whole thing, right? I'll give you our own backstory here. Okay. So

25
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,620
we fought him again in Medici where he overthrew Sebastiano Di Ravello,

26
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,539
real journalist. He had some involvement. This is his handler, Tom Sheldon.

27
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:03,270
Well, we can't skip it. There is no skipping it. We have to sit here.

28
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:12,949
So first impressions of that cut scene was, um, those animations in there. Hold on. This is so

29
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:21,000
loud. I actually just skipped that. But how am I supposed to know what happens in this one?

30
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:31,259
That's too loud. Yeah. You know, you got that right, chat. From my understanding, it's back

31
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:38,779
and forth here between two forces. Uh, one red, one blue. I'm going to monitor your progress from

32
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:47,300
a safety point. What kind of fucking system is this? Hold shift to aim down sights? What does run?

33
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,339
You get the grapple. Wait, the grapple is immediately in the game.

34
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:06,740
How do I suck to that? The road is walled off. Can you get over it? Come on. This is how the

35
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:18,410
rock used to get strong. Attach me to like four cars. What do I have to do? Okay. Where to now?

36
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,810
By the way, his new show. Those lights across the valley head towards them. Like here come the

37
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,089
Titans, whatever it's called. Jump off and pull the parachute. That's a big tower. Espinosa promises

38
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:37,050
it will change the world. No more tornadoes or hurricanes. And most of Solis believes him.

39
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,490
Project Diablo won't be a problem after today, Mira.

40
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,649
If your plan works. I don't want to fucking wait for this.

41
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,149
Reach the landing zone. What? Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up.

42
00:05:53,589 --> 00:06:04,709
Just like in Mario when you're in Mario world. Wait, I lost the momentum. No, I didn't. I'm good.

43
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:17,259
I got it. Okay. I made it under the dish. That's what they wanted me. Face to face with a black hand.

44
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,300
We've come face to face before. Heading up. Okay. So I need to go follow the waypoint

45
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,560
to the outpost. Why do I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to do this?

46
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,639
Is this just cheating? I'm cheating in the game. I don't feel like I've been playing a video game.

47
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:49,339
All right. We're going up here now. I'm so tilted. Wait, why?

48
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:58,709
Does anybody else feel like they accidentally put me in a save file that was halfway through the game?

49
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:21,959
Are these bad guys? Okay. It's fucking easy. Yeah. God, I feel just like the Punisher in this game.

50
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,569
How do I, can I grab? Is there a grab button besides that?

51
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:49,420
So I gotta, I gotta get a juggle here, right? Oh, all right. So, uh, alternate fire, release all tethers.

52
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:58,439
Fire weapon, alternate fire, tap. Oh, well that's an explosive. Okay. This game sucks.

53
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,019
We haven't even gotten through the halfway into the game tutorial. Come on guys.

54
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,100
What's going to, this is what's going to, I know, listen to me. I know exactly what's going to happen

55
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,740
with this game. This is, we skipped the cut scene. We're in the middle of the game, right? It's going

56
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,139
to do this. This is like the, the flash forward. We're going to go back. We're going to have like

57
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,779
a melee weapon. We're going to have a baseball bat and like brass knuckles.

58
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,750
This is going to take us all the way back. We're playing a mission like in the future.

59
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,279
And I just took that out. That was so mean.

60
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,399
Put a reef on timer on the screen. Not good enough. Why would I do that? Okay. Grapple and open

61
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:57,590
parachute. You can fly around. I need to land there? Every bone in your body breaks right there.

62
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:09,740
All right. Made it to the giant speakers. I made it to my show. I can't just pull it out here.

63
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:17,029
It really is the fucking Mario reference I made. You guys all thought that was

64
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:37,690
nonsense. All right. Get up there. Okay. I've made it. All right. We're fine. We did it. Wait,

65
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,330
I was supposed to go up there and then jump. Okay. I know what I have to do. Bingo and then

66
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:50,460
fly over here. This is stupid. There we go. Just use the momentum of the ground.

67
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,179
Are you sure this isn't modded?

68
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,259
No guys, I'm sorry. I downloaded goofy gravity mod. That's my own fault.

69
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,740
Structure. I'll figure it out.

70
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:38,419
I don't even know what I'm doing. Was that a person? Oh, you can drive? This car,

71
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:56,360
this car still work? Can I grapple the car? Use nitrous. I've almost made it. Come on.

72
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:17,269
I feel like I'm playing Spider-Man. This is just the Spider-Man gameplay.

73
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:47,289
I don't have any grenades left. I don't even know if I'm progressing. Oh, shit.

74
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:09,460
He just turned into the cookie monster. It's all right. I'll get up. Oh, cookies.

75
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh, I don't belong in this part of the game yet.

76
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,220
I'm at project the upper. This physics and the gravity just don't make any sense.

77
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:54,009
I'll figure it out. How do I get that? Oh, fuck. I have to fight. I mean, the conflict really is

78
00:12:54,009 --> 00:13:18,279
just there. You know what I'm saying? It just is. There's too much going on right now. I need like

79
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:31,240
a slow beginning. We're never going to get out of the tutorial. We might not. I'm at project the upper.

80
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:40,549
Okay. There's a console up there. I'll figure it out. What? I just go to the structure, right?

81
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:55,820
What did I just do to that person? All right. I made it. Okay. That's what I had to do.

82
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,779
Could use this vent to get me up there. And then jump off the edge.

83
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:16,179
Go down and link the portal level. Come on. What the fuck are you doing, man? Why would I?

84
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,320
Get up there. Release the tethers. Get up here. And then I have to parachute because

85
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,889
I just did that shit. I just did that. You can't tell me I didn't. That's what I'm trying to do.

86
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:01,029
Oh, fuck. No, we're fine. All right. We're good. Melee attack is Q. Just for anyone that's curious.

87
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,460
This way we got to jump. Okay. This is just like Mario. Another Mario reference. This is

88
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:15,159
from Mario 64. That's all we do in this channel is make Mario references. Nothing else. We don't

89
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:31,820
ever do anything else. When you land. That went too far, man. Then get. All right. Reach the console.

90
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm going to get behind cover. Is there a cover system? Look, it does explode.

91
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:03,610
All right. I got it. What did you say? What was that? All right. Shoot the explosives. That's

92
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:13,210
what I just did. See? Who just gave a hundred dollars? Lorag just gave a hundred bucks.

93
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:21,879
I don't have any more bullets left. What do you do if you don't have any more bullets?

94
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:46,409
All right. Ammo. Get it. Shoot the giant exploding Disney balls. All right. I did it.

95
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:55,720
Anybody else? I think I'm safe. Hold on. Let me get to a safe place so I can talk about it. I

96
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:07,910
just got a hundred fucking dollars. Hold on. Up there. Watch this one. Can I get some pipe in the

97
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:22,099
chat, please? Wait, I'm on this. I'm on the structure. I think I got to get off. You know,

98
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:34,059
I always wondered why. Why do you have to ask for hype? All right. So we reached the console.

99
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:45,319
All right. Did I make it? No, it's over here. Okay. All right. Weapon case.

100
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:56,490
A grenade launcher. What should I do with this? Do buildings fall down?

101
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:10,230
I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going on. I have to hack this. Okay.

102
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,519
Oh no. Not one of these. Make sure I jump before shooting.

103
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,220
Now you're sure that I don't have mods and stuff. Are we sure about this?

104
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,460
I didn't get like the deluxe edition, right?

105
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:56,920
They're trying, lady. This person's freaking me out. Can I?

106
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,119
It worked.

107
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,900
All right. Remote hacking progress. Oh, they're on a stupid machine over there.

108
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:29,000
Take your time. Don't take your time. I severely... Whoa, that was a grenade launcher. I severely

109
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:42,329
overestimated how far that was going to go. Or underestimated. This is, um,

110
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:53,880
this is... I can't even tell you what I have to say. I did it. I made it. He's unlikely he has

111
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:00,230
survived this long. This is not an ordinary mine, Senor Espinosa. See, now we're going to go back

112
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,630
to like 1982 or something.

113
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:10,950
Let's see what Project Yappa can do, shall we? Uh, lower. Thanks for the hundred dollars,

114
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,069
by the way. I had a cold and wasn't feeling too great, then I watched the green screen movie

115
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:19,750
stream and I know only do I feel absurdly healthy. I can see perfectly at night and do long division

116
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,960
without a calculator. Thanks, Jeff. You're very welcome. You're incredibly welcome.

117
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:39,559
All artillery towers. PS2 cutscene. I'm getting, am I getting hit with the explosions?

118
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:56,630
So do I think it was? See. Deal with that, please. He looks like, uh, he looks like the mask and the

119
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:25,740
bad guy gets the mask on. What's that guy's name? What's that actor's name? Bogdano. Quick rundown,

120
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:42,759
quick rundown on the game? It's fucking stupid. Look, the ground, look at the ground is even

121
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:56,420
like moving around. That cement ain't fucking holding me. Please respond.

122
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,970
See, now I have to start from zero again. See, I told you guys.

123
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,170
Maybe a few reaps. I'll need to make repairs. You guys thought it was going to be a situation where

124
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:21,960
we weren't halfway through the game. I'm sending you my coordinates. Hope it works.

125
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,950
All right, so that's all we need to know. Skip this fucking whole thing. I'm stuck. Visible cursor.

126
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:35,299
Yeah, well that's okay. So all you need to know is. Not having my grappling hook is like missing a limb.

127
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:58,740
Okay, so now we have to go to meet Mira. Pigs. I can't do anything with the pigs. Why?

128
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:13,980
I can't ride the pig. This could have been a full letter grade. Okay, well, what the hell are you

129
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:33,509
talking about? Connect, is that, okay. What is that? Thanks for telling me. That looks like the place.

130
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,690
I'm no longer connected to the servers. I've never seen anything like Iapo before.

131
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:52,200
Mira might be right. All right, everyone's dressed like a Pokemon trainer.

132
00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:11,130
Don't have your graphics on low. The graphics aren't on low. What are you talking about? Two double

133
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:18,250
anti-scopic filtering. 1080. Fixa. High, high, yes. Medium and medium.

134
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,019
What the hell is this thing? Is this like a bridge?

135
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:45,289
Okay. All right, let's go meet Mira. Zero percent. Zero percent what? What's on the phone?

136
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:55,910
What's up? I wanted to see the phone. All right, let's go.

137
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:05,829
Glowing hair. Oh, this whole game feels like it was made in second life.

138
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,420
Are you sure this isn't a modded version of the game? Are you certain of that?

139
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,539
That would hurt.

140
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:43,289
What happened? Everything okay? Yeah, fine. It's all over. Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just fine.

141
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,869
Things are going great over here. If you fall from that high and you land, you're going to disintegrate.

142
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:21,619
Just fine for, yep. I almost didn't make it again. Okay, easy now. Refund and get, yeah,

143
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:26,819
so this is second life. Where are the people with the elaborate like $400 animated dancing?

144
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:31,269
That's what I'm worried about.

145
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:42,869
Is that dog? That dog, that dog is very small. Doesn't look to undersize like it wasn't scaled

146
00:26:42,869 --> 00:27:11,380
properly. Can you pick up dog? It's kind of leaning to the left here. It's leaning to the left.

147
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,380
I don't know. I don't think it's going to make it. I don't think this dog is going to make it.

148
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:38,759
Oh, well, okay. It's smart. No, maybe it's not. Come on over here. I got something to show you.

149
00:27:42,940 --> 00:28:22,839
Let's find out just how smart you really are. Come on. Come on. Are you peeing over here?

150
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:37,849
That's really cute of you. Good job, dog.

151
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:46,619
Is there something else you want to do? You sure? No, all right, fine.

152
00:28:49,180 --> 00:29:05,019
Well, you're very good at handstands. That's for sure. Oh, fuck. All right, meet Mira. The dog was

153
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:28,660
doing a dog T-pose. That is pretty accurate. Up here. All right, I'm going to bother. Here comes

154
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:51,700
cutscene in three, two, 30 FPS cutscene. Yes. You look awful. Yeah, so does this game. The black

155
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,329
hand are casing the village. Does that happen often? I'm being unfair. I think I'm being unfair.

156
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,569
It's only been like fucking 20 minutes. Maybe somebody attacked their weather base.

157
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:14,839
Tools? Jesus fucking Christ. You could just hand it to me. Why would you boot the toolbox over here?

158
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,680
I don't think I can take project the apple alone. We're in the same room. I agree.

159
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm saying I was wrong. You were right. Is that a distress signal? I didn't think you were with

160
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:37,289
the agency anymore. Help me with this. Don't let him fool you. That's just an elaborate fucking

161
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:42,500
Yu-Gi-Oh toy. What do we do about Yappa? Between the blizzard and those artillery towers?

162
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:54,980
I can't get close. I have a couple of ideas. Tell me. Wait. Listen. What do we- a helicopter?

163
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,019
Your actions in the next few minutes may determine the fate of this community.

164
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:03,670
Choices matter? I am Commander Morales. I have tolerated El Abismo for years.

165
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,470
To maintain order and justice in Solis. This game is using the McDonald's happy meal engine.

166
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,509
For the criminal and the disenfranchised. That's what somebody just said. Last night a terrorist

167
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:21,349
attack was launched against the project Yappa facility. The culprit was abetted by a conspirator

168
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:28,150
from this village. Who is that? Gabriela. She killed my uncle when I was a girl. Is it my settings?

169
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,789
Maybe I should turn some settings to up or down or something. If Mira Morales is not surrendered

170
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:39,589
to me immediately, I'll be forced to conduct an exhaustive investigation. Every home will be

171
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:46,150
searched. Every citizen's identity will be checked. And all transgressions will be harshly prosecuted.

172
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:51,589
One guy had the gun to the left. You. You know what I mean? Like that guy's not in- that guy on the

173
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:56,950
right. See that? Everybody had that gun pointing down to our left. He had it pointed to our right.

174
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:01,029
Where is Mira? That's the fucking hitman right there. That's the guy that's in disguise.

175
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:04,730
I don't even need to look at the back of the box to find, uh,

176
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:19,140
Meryl's codec. I already know. Let him go, cousin. At least you aren't a coward.

177
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,410
Your father would be disgusted with the monster you've become.

178
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,609
All right, take the guns away and give him ski poles.

179
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:45,500
In prison. Why are they in this gear here? Wouldn't it be too hot to be in- that was a jump scare for

180
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:55,690
them. This is sad. Can we hit two likes? I freeze. Oh, here comes the first decision,

181
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,170
first quick time decision of the game. All right, well, I did- he just- he's dead. He shot- all

182
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:20,920
right, that's where he's at. So I'm the cause of this. All right, forget about Pokemon. What the

183
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:39,670
hell? I did that. Okay, I did that. I can't skip this cutscene, you know, we're too far into it.

184
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:40,809
We need re-

185
00:33:43,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Get over here! Come here! I could have done that, right? You'd like pitch shift me like 5% and let

186
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,760
me fucking scream. I would be a great scorpion. You know, uh, if anyone's watching right now,

187
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,599
that's part of the scorpion dev team. I do consulting work, you know. I think we just

188
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,880
started a rebellion. We didn't have to drag these people into this. They are what we need to put

189
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:25,260
down, Project Yappa. Well, they'll need more guns. Eso. There's a factory down the road from here.

190
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,980
Abandoned. Cascillos vacios. Fix the graphics. You can't, what? Put every setting to low.

191
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,820
No, not yet. We can't give up yet. Anyone who wants to fight the Black Hand gets to fight.

192
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:47,030
Sure for it? I promise. Before the stream is over, we will do the Best Buy computer all the way to

193
00:34:47,030 --> 00:35:06,869
the left on the shelf settings. I promise. I promise. Hope everything works. We've already

194
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:11,909
given up. What? What have I given up yet? We just got started. Look, I can like throw this over here.

195
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:20,280
He's fine. Just jump. See? See, look at this. I cars out. It already gets a letter grade.

196
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:25,320
Do you guys understand? There's a letter grade. Holy fuck. Why are you psycho?

197
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:35,739
What? What? Why is it? What's wrong with their car? Wait, what? Their car was just like eating

198
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:41,099
somebody. Their car was just chewing on someone. All right. Wingsuit. Oh, it's because I went over

199
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:54,409
here. God damn it. Hold on. He's fine. Just jump. You can't let me. But you just opened up cars.

200
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:03,699
Oh, bah. I can't do it yet. All right. Well, we have to wingsuit over here.

201
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:08,809
Hope everything works. Oh, battle bus.

202
00:36:37,659 --> 00:36:40,659
All right. That's the factory. Oh,

203
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,769
when we drop right here. Oh, there's a guy at the cube. There's a guy at the cube.

204
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,210
That's what you've got. Your AR lens mirror told me already done.

205
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:11,860
Something like that. Let's get started. I feel like this shouldn't be happening.

206
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Where am I getting the momentum to do this? Do you understand this is not physically fucking

207
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:42,579
possible? That's not how these work. That's the end.

208
00:37:42,579 --> 00:38:16,409
I'm the hacker. That's what you've got.

209
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:24,809
You have an AR lens, like a little computer on your eyeball. Can I like shit something like

210
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:30,039
bird shit on people? Can I like throw rocks? You know what I meant by that. Can I like throw rocks

211
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:46,519
down at people? Okay, Sargento, you're up. Use the AR scan to find generators. The factory needs to

212
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:50,519
be powered on, but the doors to the electrical room are being held shut by backup generators.

213
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,800
How many times are you going to make the Fortnite joke? Will it be every time you jump from a

214
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,360
little bit? Or will it? Because that would be funny if you did that.

215
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,639
Okay, so we just gotta find the generators. Well, there's one over here. There's one over there.

216
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,579
This one was the closest one. What the fuck is that thing?

217
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,059
That's somebody's little toy helicopter. What? All right. Well, this one's over here. Let's go

218
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:37,380
this one first. One, two. I couldn't do it. I was going to do the Yahoo. So here's the generator

219
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:53,030
right here. I can't have this much power. I'm trying to do like this. All right, we're good.

220
00:39:53,030 --> 00:40:01,190
Use AR scanner. Here's your mission. The factory needs to be powered on. The electrical room are

221
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,269
being held shut by backup generators. We shouldn't accept it.

222
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:36,840
I need to get on this guy's motorcycle. It's important. No, don't slow down. Oh shit,

223
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:53,050
I gotta turn around. No, before I lose. Okay, I gotta stop. Let's play.

224
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:04,309
Here's your mission. The factory needs to be powered on, but the doors to the electrical

225
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:11,639
room are being held shut by backup generators. Mission accepted, Sergeant. Your AR lens will

226
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,599
show you where to look. It's only a matter of time before Gabriela sends more black

227
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:26,699
to stop us. Oh my body. This game has got way better, by the way. All right, this is this one

228
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:33,400
right here. Use it to scan the building. There it is. Okay, there's a generator building.

229
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,489
Very good. Let's go over to it. Fuel barrels. Aim at the barrel and hold to start tether.

230
00:41:43,130 --> 00:42:12,949
Oh, I can do that? Generators well shielded. Oh my god. Can you turn it off? To rip the plating

231
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,710
off. Oh, I can use my grappling hook, but I can't use a fucking rocket launcher.

232
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:32,489
Oh, I guess I shoot it in the guts. Build, build, build. One generator down. All right, I get it.

233
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:34,820
Okay, two more to go. You know where to look.

234
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:47,480
All right, so there's one over here. Am I gonna, am I gonna get minus for that one? Why?

235
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:55,480
Do you think that was fun? What's closer? 177 to 171. They're both right next to each other.

236
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,739
I won't do that again. I'm fine. Somebody's shooting.

237
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:31,030
What was that? Zip. Is he alive? Zip. What the fuck? What the fuck is that thing?

238
00:43:38,409 --> 00:44:03,340
Why is this here? Wait. Okay. Okay, Sargento. You're up. Listo. Here's your mission. Wait,

239
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,780
hold on. What about the little school bus? But the doors to the electrical room are being held

240
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,739
shut by backup generators. Mission accepted. I gotta get on the battle bus. Hold on.

241
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:19,179
It's only a matter of time before Gabriela saves more black man to stop us.

242
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:21,739
All right, I'm gonna do this quick. We need to get these people guns fast.

243
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:33,030
There's one here. Just go. I know how to do this. Let's go to this one first.

244
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:48,260
Fuel barrels. That hurt. Really? Okay, pull this off. Generators well shielded. What the hell are

245
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,739
you doing? I think I can use my grappling hook to rip the plating off.

246
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:03,989
Destroy the generator. Good. One generator down. What's in here? What is that? Okay, two more to

247
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,900
go. What is this thing? You know where to look. Oh god, don't make me say like another Fortnite

248
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:26,219
reference. Another Fortnite gun. What? I don't know. Does this thing shoot blades? Toaster gun.

249
00:45:28,469 --> 00:45:31,690
No, this is the halo promotion. Oh, the other one was right there.

250
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:55,139
Oh. And boink. No, hold it.

251
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,579
And let's use the Fortnite gun. Pretty good actually. I don't want to get rid of this.

252
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:12,059
I'll get rid of this stupid one. What do you got in this box? Oh, nice double Fortnite gun.

253
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:24,199
Oh, come on. Seriously, how am I alive? I don't know how I...

254
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:42,780
Helicopter? No, it didn't. Go for the brain. Got it. Got the brain. Shoot the fucking brain,

255
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:59,940
guys. Every time. All right, we're good. I think that's it. We have one more to do,

256
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:08,150
which is down here. Are we still alive in here? No, no one's alive in there. You're behind me.

257
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:23,369
That was so fucking loud. All right, let's go quickly. This thing is you get to skip so

258
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:28,090
much nonsense doing this. Okay, I'm gonna kill... I'm gonna die if I keep doing that. I keep thinking

259
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:41,829
I'm gonna... I keep hitting my fucking head on the wall. That's not good. Almost done. Here's the last

260
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:57,460
one. Generators are all off. Let's take this and I'm gonna replace this with this. Choppers and troops

261
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,019
headed this way. Choppers heading this way. I'll take him out with one hit. Oh, what about this

262
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:34,309
thing? Yep. Those are birds. All right. Where they at? Come on. All right, they're not coming.

263
00:48:34,309 --> 00:49:06,869
Time to go. Really? Fuck. Don't do that! No! All right, I gotta slow down. Where is it?

264
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,960
No, that was just... Little Mikey got a fucking toy for Christmas and that just went into the

265
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,860
coffee table and broke. That's what that was. On the first day of Christmas day, really?

266
00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:47,130
Oh, whoops. Sorry, guy. All right, let's go. I was laughing at the stream.

267
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,289
Controller aim. What are you talking about? I gotta flip the switch.

268
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:22,550
I'll put up the Ghostbusters ghost thing. All right, come on. How do I get rid of these?

269
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:46,920
Eventually, I'll get it. Yeah! Here's the other one. I swear to God, I'm never gonna be able to get over it.

270
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:56,309
Breakers are on. And the Black Hand are almost here. Just hit the master override.

271
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,019
I can't. I have to do it every time. It's too much fun.

272
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:18,760
We're in business. Let's call everyone in. Uh oh, I'm closed in. Just give the order. Open the map.

273
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,480
The front lines... The front line is represented by these lines on your map.

274
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:30,389
This is where the Army of Chaos is holding back the Black Hand. Okay. The Zykan represents a

275
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:39,820
deployed squad. Secure regions by advancing or deploying squads. Select the Wachikuni region.

276
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:49,269
The Wachikuni. Okay. Can I like move the map? I think I just put... I put one in the wrong place,

277
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:54,340
apparently. I want to move the map. Okay. Well.

278
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:11,780
Should I just hide in here? Is this my safe bunker here? 60 FPS in-game cutscene.

279
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:32,980
All right. Is that mine? How long was I in there for?

280
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:39,780
It's been a few days. There's a bunch of canned soup in there. I felt like I could just stay.

281
00:52:42,659 --> 00:53:06,019
This reminds me of those Kingdom Hearts III cutscene trailers they were showing at E3.

282
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:25,769
Is that gun gonna be any good? Come on, man. You opened that skin in a basic crate.

283
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:45,510
Did you see my weapon skin? I bought it on the Steam store. What happened here? I thought that

284
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,760
was music playing for a second. I thought that was a big party going on over there and that was just

285
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:59,800
music. To advance your front line, you need new squads for your army. To inspire people to join

286
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,280
you, destroy black hand infrastructure and vehicles. This creates chaos. You can notify

287
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:23,159
when you have enough chaos to recruit new people into squads. I'm part of the party.

288
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,519
All right. We got coordinates. What is going on over here though?

289
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:36,139
I need to investigate. He's playing the music over here.

290
00:54:38,219 --> 00:54:55,690
What weapon is this? That guy's getting lit up. Where are you going? Oh my god. Watch it. I'm

291
00:54:55,690 --> 00:55:15,900
the leader. Don't shoot me. Oh my lord. This person is destroying the whole bunker. What? I

292
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:24,550
could fly this? Where the fuck did I go? I'm in space. I'm in space. It put me into space.

293
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:45,349
Oh no, it didn't. I'm underwater. What's this thing? The blade is still spinning. It's a rare

294
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:52,440
weapon down here. Look at it. Are they still shooting this thing in the fucking ground?

295
00:55:53,320 --> 00:56:06,300
Is there another helicopter? I don't know what's over here. I'm fucking so confused.

296
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:21,670
I need to get over here. Okay, so this is an enemy outpost.

297
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:54,739
They just let me go on here. I'm making so much chaos though, guys. Uh-oh. Speaking of chaos,

298
00:56:58,969 --> 00:57:15,849
they're using the laser gun to burn me. That guy sounded like he's in my bedroom. I gotta get out

299
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:22,579
of here. I gotta do like something. I gotta do like a mission or something. There's a whole new

300
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:41,349
game environment over here. Who did that? Who even did that? All right, let's go. Where's my

301
00:57:41,349 --> 00:58:30,010
scanner? I did that. Hostile still active. Hold on. No, hold on. I gotta go to the mission marker.

302
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:38,789
Lower the settings. This looks too real. They're just gonna do this forever. It's never gonna end.

303
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:52,619
So, why would I even? Oh, you can. Okay, hold on. Oh, nice. I got the skin. That was a teammate.

304
00:58:54,219 --> 00:59:20,260
Is it a washing machine? This really is fucking Fortnite. Are you fucking serious?

305
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:34,809
You idiot. Don't do it. Don't do it. I know you want to, but don't do it. I forgot even

306
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:39,539
what I'm supposed to be doing. All right, we need to go to the mission marker. Weapon crate.

307
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:48,550
Turn the graphics down. No, not yet. I'm not turning the graphics off yet. Okay, release all

308
00:59:48,550 --> 01:00:02,599
tethers. Where is the mission? I just have to cause chaos for like a little while. It's a chaos meter

309
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:25,929
up the top, right? How do I get to the map? Okay, there's the chaos meter. This is too much happening.

310
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:45,079
All right, I'm gonna go over here. M is not bringing up the map. It's not M.

311
01:00:48,659 --> 01:01:01,800
We both shot each other. I win. One? Why is the map one? Okay, so we got this one here.

312
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,860
Sargento says he's got a surprise. Go to the coordinates and see what's going on. All right,

313
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:25,320
that's it's S. It's right here. I made it. Stupid fucking wingsuit, man.

314
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:41,099
All right, we're good. Get off this. This is so stupid.

315
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:47,960
This would be a lot of fun though if this was real life. All right, there's the

316
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:57,019
where I gotta go. All right, let's wingsuit in. Nice and careful. Air brake is control.

317
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:21,130
Okay, that's how it works. I'm ready. It feels like GTA with cheats. Yeah, that's exactly what it

318
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:31,219
feels like. It feels like you shouldn't be able to do this. Load up the truck. We're leaving in 60

319
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:36,579
seconds. Did you organize the ambush? See, most of the stuff we recovered is standard black

320
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:44,949
ammunition. But I also found some of these. We're not sure what they do. We didn't want to mess with

321
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,070
this. It's very bright.

322
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:51,349
There's a bunch more left in the truck. Metal Gear Solid 5.

323
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:59,989
This could be useful. They won't have a screwdriver. Somebody's had one.

324
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:07,190
You have to make do with whatever you find. So we didn't metal gear solid 5 people.

325
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:17,429
You actually can. I mean, that's just like a straight one. They thought that was cool

326
01:03:17,429 --> 01:03:21,110
from Metal Gear Solid. They were like, yeah, I guess we're going here too. Sounds like a fun

327
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:38,940
mechanic to put in our game. All right, here we go. Grapple onto the truck.

328
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,780
Who's coming? I'm not even on the truck right now. This didn't work.

329
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,949
That balloon thing is pretty cool, huh? I think it'll come in handy.

330
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:53,210
Where'd you learn to plan an ambush?

331
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:06,199
I want the cow. I want the cow over here. I don't care about the mission.

332
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:11,449
Oh yeah, just one.

333
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:23,829
All right, you're fine.

334
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:38,090
One, open grappling hook menu. One, three. Okay, air lifter. This is where you can edit your

335
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:43,829
grappling hook. Currently you have loadout A equipped. You can have multiple loadouts

336
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:52,099
you can edit independently. Okay, so currently you have loadout A selected. Switch to loadout B.

337
01:04:53,880 --> 01:05:02,070
Edit the empty loadout. This is your loadout edit screen. Columns define what your button presses

338
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:09,210
do. The auto column will activate mods. I knew it. Automatically when the tether is deployed.

339
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:13,769
Actions on the tap and hold columns will only activate when you tap or hold F.

340
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:20,380
Oh, that was a huge amount of money that came in. You're right. Did we even address the last one?

341
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:30,199
We did, right? Okay, I'm just making sure like I didn't just fucking skip it like an idiot.

342
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,900
Add a medium force air lifter to the auto column. The air lifter will automatically deploy to be

343
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:51,210
left up to be medium. Okay, it's right click to go back. This is so odd. Now the air lifter is

344
01:05:51,210 --> 01:06:14,739
equipped in this loadout. Use the air lifter to clear the road. Holy shit. Wait, what am I doing?

345
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:26,789
I can actually stand on this? Oops. That's bad. Okay, hold on. 200 fucking dollars just came in.

346
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:40,119
100 dollars from D three four D dead C four T. Who fucking died here?

347
01:06:42,199 --> 01:07:08,380
Oops. That guy's alive. Aim at the wreck. Hold on. Okay, aim at the wreck. Who is doing this?

348
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:18,179
And release. Oh my god, people are giving so much money. Hold on. Give me a second. I need to I need

349
01:07:18,179 --> 01:07:25,829
to address these. Dead C four T just gave 100 dollars. 100 fucking bucks. Who even is Jerma?

350
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:37,929
Also love the YouTube. YouTube. Thank you. That's me. I am currently Jerma. And I think I will be

351
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:43,530
for a while. I don't know if I'll have any plans on being anybody else. But thank you so much.

352
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,769
Dead C four T for the 100 fucking dollars. And then right after that, I'm pink gave 100 dollars

353
01:07:51,769 --> 01:08:03,050
to 100. 100. No message. Just 100 bucks. 100 dollars. And then right after that, 50 dollars

354
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:08,679
from Juno. And they say there's a lovely Easter egg in this game with a link.

355
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:21,319
Is this a spoiler? I don't understand what it is. I don't know if that's like a spoiler.

356
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:29,750
Might be a spoiler. It's a gnome. No, it's not. Somebody just drew that on their map and pretended.

357
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:36,859
But thank you to all three you guys. That's a fucking lot of money.

358
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:40,460
That's like 300 bucks in fucking an hour. Not even. See, that's what I mean.

359
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:49,880
Stuff like that. All right. Now escort him to the extraction point. You think I'd make a good agent

360
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:55,399
like you? Let me get on here. Keep your eyes on the road, Sargento. What the fuck? Because I think I

361
01:08:55,399 --> 01:09:02,180
could do it. I always wanted to do something important. He's complicated, Sargento. He put

362
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:15,060
cake topper on. All right. What do I need to do? Escort him? That's what I'm doing. See you later.

363
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:32,979
Why are you not driving? Maybe that's why. Extracted. Oh, that guy was an S-rank. Holy shit,

364
01:09:32,979 --> 01:10:00,489
guys. What else? That it? Who's shooting at us? Where are you? What the fuck are you doing here,

365
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:12,859
man? What? How are you even holding on to this? I don't have any bullets left.

366
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:47,779
I attached it? I don't understand. That thing is so heavy. Thanks for spawning me in a great

367
01:10:47,779 --> 01:11:06,810
place with no fucking ammo. Whatever. Fuck it. Okay. Start the tether. Let's go. Get it up.

368
01:11:07,909 --> 01:11:19,909
What have I created? All right, we're good. Is that a grenade?

369
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:33,750
This is what works for me, Sargento. You'll find what works for you. Get out of here.

370
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:39,430
For now, just worry about getting us to the extraction point.

371
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:46,949
On the head. Perfect. All right, I get to have a different weapon. This is the only weapon I have.

372
01:11:52,180 --> 01:12:00,970
I can't even do anything. I don't have any bullets in this gun. And I have no other weapon.

373
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:04,569
All right, here we go. Here it comes again.

374
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:11,289
This time, I gotta be at the different... Don't. Don't.

375
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:21,380
At Bravo Station. We talked about this. Okay, there it is. There it goes. Here comes a helicopter,

376
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:32,220
right? CC, we'll be waiting. Over and out. What the fuck are you doing? Wait, I have to... Wait,

377
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:41,319
wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What the hell? How do I let go? I have to let go

378
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:52,970
of this. Just focus, Sargento. Drive. They're still coming. All right, I'm going, I'm going.

379
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:03,899
These people just don't give a fuck. At all. Look at how many people are here.

380
01:13:04,539 --> 01:13:06,939
That guy on the motorcycle just definitely died.

381
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:22,680
I can't... They just have a balloon on their car. That doesn't do... That didn't do anything.

382
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,960
How have we not ran this guy over?

383
01:13:37,289 --> 01:13:51,880
What am I doing on top of the car? Get out of here. Oh, shit. Give me this. No, get on it.

384
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:58,020
Oh, I don't know how to drive this. I don't know how to drive this going too fast.

385
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,550
All right, we're fine. Oh, fuck.

386
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:09,270
You work out those hiccups, Sargento, and you could be a real operations master for the army.

387
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:18,170
No, I can't. I gotta get out of here. I gotta go, gotta go. I'm almost there.

388
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:29,539
All right, don't run into them. Watch this. Ready? And somehow that does not kill them.

389
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:52,810
What? Go, go, go. Hide away. Inflate, inflate. All right, that's gonna take them away, right?

390
01:14:53,529 --> 01:15:09,189
How heavy is this thing? You are so heavy. Grapple them to the ground.

391
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:31,050
They can't move. Oh, shit. Get the blimp. It's too far away, I think.

392
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:39,100
Oh, no, he's alive. He's fine.

393
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:52,710
Lock and load, people. The Black Hand want their supplies back. Everything's fine.

394
01:15:55,859 --> 01:16:01,270
How do we stop this guy from doing this? I don't have any guns.

395
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:09,909
I need a gun. I need to get like a gun or something. Give me a gun. Give me a gun.

396
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:18,439
Where's that weapon? Is it a weapon box? Weapon box. Weapon box is everywhere, in every direction.

397
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:30,949
Who is that? Okay, we're good. It's a shotgun.

398
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:57,479
This is live. Oh, you guys are alive. These people are fucking insane. I'm in a multiplayer

399
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:17,539
GTA lobby right now. Come on, secondary fire. Don't ever blow it up. Helicopter. Where is it?

400
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,539
Down there. What is it carrying? Time until extraction.

401
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,560
I'll work behind the lines. Make sure the armies stay stocked and safe.

402
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:49,960
You need an army. You stick together. Am I this bad? Yeah. Hey, sure.

403
01:17:51,560 --> 01:18:11,779
Why can I not hit this? Oh, wait. Holy fuck, thank god. Help Sargento train the army.

404
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:18,340
Search the map for training and counterintelligence operations. Help Sargento and the army of chaos

405
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:36,460
will earn mod points that can unlock airlifter mods. All right, I don't want the stupid sniper

406
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:56,439
rifle anymore. All right, let's go. Squads received. So this is Garland King's new star. American

407
01:18:56,439 --> 01:19:01,880
filmmaker Garland King has an offer that can't be refused. Meet him, meet with her, and hear what

408
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:14,420
she has to say. Yeah, let's do that. Close notifications. Oh, this is like the friends list.

409
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:24,659
One, two, three bullshit. What the hell? Make it M, man. Who's lost the target?

410
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:36,409
All right, we gotta go to G. I have a stun grenade. So we have to get from here over to there

411
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:41,210
in one jump. One, two, three.

412
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:04,810
Almost there. What the fuck was that? That just exploded.

413
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:13,189
Open the self-reeducation center.

414
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,430
There should be a control panel you can use.

415
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:21,460
I'm never gonna get that. No, I want to do the G. I had G.

416
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:52,340
Whatever. I'll just do this one. Open the south center. Fire stun grenade.

417
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:08,069
So satisfying. Is he stunned? What the hell was that? Oh, it's a grenade launcher.

418
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:29,140
I didn't kill anyone. Not one fucking person died. Not one person died. I find that hard

419
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:53,300
to believe. Weapon. Can create? No. What the? What was that? Who are these people?

420
01:21:54,979 --> 01:21:59,380
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. These are okay. The army of chaos is breaking you free,

421
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:00,579
but we'll have to fight our way out.

422
01:22:00,579 --> 01:22:15,369
I don't. Just let him go for a fly.

423
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:34,819
Drop his gun. What an idiot. What an idiot. He let go of the gun. Ow. Oh, fuck. He's gonna kill me.

424
01:22:52,069 --> 01:23:13,960
All right. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Nice. Did you see that? Somebody saw that. You guys saw that,

425
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:19,699
right? Did my computer turn off? Or did you see it? I got a rifle now.

426
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:47,720
I've got a group to the entrance. Send someone to extract him.

427
01:23:49,640 --> 01:24:04,310
Extraction inbound. Objective locked. What? Thanks, Jerm. Very cool. You are so welcome,

428
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:09,720
man. You're so gosh darn welcome. All right. Now take it back to the instruction point.

429
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:15,449
That's not the right way. Back it up. Can I get in the car with you?

430
01:24:18,739 --> 01:24:29,109
Oh, I'm the leader of your crew. Get out of the fucking car.

431
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:41,500
Like, let me drive. Why would you turn this music on?

432
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:10,489
I'm what? Is this a radio station that's playing right now? This guy's gonna have a really bad day.

433
01:25:16,229 --> 01:25:30,359
Why would you turn into me? All right. Let me drive. Get out of the way.

434
01:25:40,869 --> 01:26:01,609
How do I turn the fucking radio off? Thank God. I don't understand music, man. Let me complain

435
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:07,770
about something. What is with music now? Where the whole song is just I'm building up a fucking

436
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:11,609
power level. That's the whole it's just like, here we go. Here we go. It's getting a little

437
01:26:11,609 --> 01:26:15,130
bit bigger. It's getting stronger. Here we go. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.

438
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,489
This is the sound. This is the sound. Here it comes. Here it comes. That's every song.

439
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,340
How many songs does it have to come out that are just

440
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:01,670
he's an out of touch mover? No, it's just everybody's everybody builds music.

441
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:06,069
Instead of making a song, they build up to a song and then the song ends.

442
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:22,890
All right, people. It's time to free yourselves. Come on. I can't. How am I going to get them?

443
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:30,260
We owe you so much. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Let's listen to it.

444
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,939
Isn't it amazing that we are using?

445
01:27:39,020 --> 01:28:08,579
Instead of. Well, you know what I mean, though? It's you know what I mean.

446
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:39,579
No, no, no, no. I'm trying to get the helicopter over here.

447
01:28:44,170 --> 01:28:58,170
It worked. It worked. Make sure he's dead. All right. Let's go. Where are my friends?

448
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:12,119
Forgetting this is not a shotgun. Who? What is it? There's a person right here.

449
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:22,569
All right, let's do it. OK. Can I see a little bit of hype in the chat?

450
01:29:43,500 --> 01:30:06,649
I'll take this. All right, we get it. No, we didn't cover their escape. Oh, look at that. Hold on.

451
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:15,220
I got it. I got to turn on the fucking music. This doesn't have a radio. OK, that's fun. That's fun.

452
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:35,210
That was a fucking bit of Legos, apparently. Push it over. Ideas. What do we do?

453
01:30:53,770 --> 01:31:00,170
I was hoping I could see if we could fall this way. Crush everyone. Yell about.

454
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,079
Now we're going to go like this.

455
01:31:15,079 --> 01:31:20,649
Come on, use a grapple and pull the bridge down.

456
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:44,649
Nice.

457
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:52,810
Bridge is open.

458
01:31:57,590 --> 01:32:04,300
Imagine how sick this would make you.

459
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:29,670
You didn't do that. All right, we're going to we're going to go on the tractor.

460
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:37,529
Can I fit everybody in the in the tractor here? This is just got to fall out of grade, by the way.

461
01:32:48,789 --> 01:32:49,829
How do I pick somebody up?

462
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:01,859
Wait, hold on.

463
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:22,090
Oh, no. Battle bots. God damn it.

464
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:33,449
Oh, thank God it started to be over here. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

465
01:33:33,449 --> 01:33:55,960
Here we go. Thank God I can do it again. What? Really? I can't pick them up?

466
01:34:18,869 --> 01:34:26,310
It's just toys. It really is. They just it's just bouncing toys. Just Cause 2 was the same way,

467
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:36,939
man. It was just fucking toys. Where is everybody? Toy Chest 2. What are you shooting at? I don't

468
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:45,539
even know. Fine. Take them down. Blow them up. Whatever. Who cares? Nothing even matters.

469
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,500
All right, I can put my face in this.

470
01:34:48,500 --> 01:35:03,829
What? What?

471
01:35:12,260 --> 01:35:27,270
Get out of here. Weapon chest. Oh, long scope. All right. Destroy the infrastructure. There's one

472
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:33,739
more. Where is it? Up there. Oh, this is going to be an epic moment.

473
01:35:33,739 --> 01:36:21,859
No, I didn't get it. Okay, let's get out of here. Not even fucking close. All right,

474
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:33,829
cover the escape. All right, you're good. I got all three of us, right?

475
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:38,470
It's like I got hit in the face with an explosion. I think we lost one.

476
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:47,739
Lower the bridge. Who is dropping grenades on us? Where are these coming from? Who the

477
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:51,350
fuck is throwing these? They're disappearing out of the sky.

478
01:36:57,579 --> 01:37:08,180
Where is he? Where is he? Is he on the boat? His face is fucking up the direction.

479
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:30,199
He comes down. All right, here we go. Okay, one of these guys, I'm going to turn on the fucking

480
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:56,100
jacks here, guys. Sorry. I had to turn it on for a minute. He's on my ammo, but I would have jacked

481
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:04,920
him. Oh no, you're going to die. I need something. How much health do you have? Stay okay. No,

482
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,239
no, no. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. No, no, no. Get out of the way. Out of the way.

483
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:31,619
You idiot. You're almost out. Who's left? I got to make sure at least one guy gets out.

484
01:38:47,100 --> 01:39:00,630
Why are you walking up there? What are you doing? At least get in the car, dude. Get in the car. Can

485
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:16,069
you get in the car? Get in. That's the last group, Sargento.

486
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:36,340
He did it. That's the idea. Good work, people. We got one person. All right, so now we can open

487
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:40,819
the map and we were doing what was the mission we were doing. What the hell? We were doing

488
01:39:40,819 --> 01:39:45,460
something. By clearing 1A extraction, you made it safe for the army to advance and secure the

489
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:51,880
Tierra del Cuapec region. And by causing chaos, you earned more squads which are now awaiting

490
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:59,859
your orders in the reserves. Ready to secure. This number indicates how many squads you need

491
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:06,729
from your reserves to secure the area. One. Two. Lower this cost by securing adjacent regions

492
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:10,090
and advancing already deployed squads instead of deploying new ones from your reserves.

493
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:18,069
Okay, let's get it. I win. This is what I was trying to do in the first place, but what is this?

494
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:23,539
The army of chaos is getting ready to retrieve intel from a black hand radar outpost, but before

495
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:35,939
they move, Amira needs a favor. All right, hold on a second here. Unlock mods. Gas. Choose different

496
01:40:35,939 --> 01:40:42,300
gases for explosive effects. Helium, explosive, hydrogen. So I can make a balloon and explode it.

497
01:40:43,449 --> 01:40:48,489
Fragile. Change the armor used on the airlifter. Fragile, invulnerable player, invulnerable enemies.

498
01:40:48,489 --> 01:41:02,869
Okay. Float. Change how the airlifter moves. Float. Guided follow. Peak altitude. Change the

499
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:14,729
maximum altitude of the airlifter. Holy shit. I don't even need to see the other ones. Set what

500
01:41:14,729 --> 01:41:22,789
the lifter will do at its peak altitude. You can hover it or pop. Okay, well, let's try this. Gas,

501
01:41:22,789 --> 01:41:29,939
gas. Step on the gas. We got something new over here. Splash damage. Oh man. Oh, I only got one

502
01:41:29,939 --> 01:42:02,840
kill. Let's go. Your support is on route. What happened? Did I, what did I do? Um, okay.

503
01:42:09,779 --> 01:42:15,289
Got him. You actually made it over there? How the fuck did you do that, man?

504
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:37,140
I don't believe it. How many of these balloons is it going to take? It's pulling in every direction.

505
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:49,430
You're still fine up there. How is that even possible? Still just floating around.

506
01:42:50,069 --> 01:43:02,899
Get over there. Still hasn't crashed. All right, it's my turn. I want to see how hard this is.

507
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:08,680
It's not even fucking hard. You're overreacting.

508
01:43:14,819 --> 01:43:23,460
All right, where am I going? All right, get rid of the tethers. I just have a helicopter. All right,

509
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:29,739
so I can fire a missile or switch vehicle position. All right, I have 91 missiles.

510
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:33,449
I should probably call this chaos, right?

511
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:51,979
Why did that hurt me? You understand? I shot that thing and it blew me up. What's this fucking

512
01:43:51,979 --> 01:44:08,380
thorns damage? I was supposed to do that. All right, cool. Somebody's got on a SAM site, aren't they?

513
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:16,119
Where?

514
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,119
Holy fuck.

515
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:56,600
Well, I just was playing around. All right, where am I going? Here, right here. Track it. Right here.

516
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:21,350
Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.

517
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:35,270
If you're sitting down, get up. Dance now. Unless you're driving. In that case, just move your head.

518
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:05,750
Oh, sorry, cow.

519
01:46:10,090 --> 01:46:34,470
I'm a monster. I'm not. I don't even know how I hit my head on the ground. That didn't make any

520
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:45,210
sense. Action. Action. Okay, start it. Just seems to happen every single time. You're right.

521
01:46:47,050 --> 01:46:50,489
Hey, go sober up, Charlie. Get him working on some new pages with the frogs.

522
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:58,390
Hey, look at you, you handsome devil. Garland King, you've heard of me. No, but I've heard you can

523
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:05,270
help the army of chaos. Let's not worry about that now. Come on, walk with me. Rico. I love everything

524
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:13,350
about you, man. The look, the swagger, the leather. You're an artist. The Da Vinci of violence,

525
01:47:14,069 --> 01:47:18,630
which is why I need you for this picture. I get to be in the movie. We'll work out the details.

526
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:21,829
This seems like it's going to be kind of fun. You see that barely floating rust bucket there?

527
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:27,109
See, I need it to careen through the water. My stuntmen bless their square jaws. They can take

528
01:47:27,109 --> 01:47:34,229
a left hook, but they lack the touch of a true artiste. So here you take these and I want you.

529
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:40,390
Details. Just plant them on the rust bucket and blow it up, baby. Straight to the great dry dock

530
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:50,659
in the sky. Turn off motion blur? I don't think you can. Are you in? I suppose I could. Perfect.

531
01:47:50,659 --> 01:47:55,060
We'll get your agent a copy of the contract. You don't have an agent. We'll get you an agent.

532
01:47:55,699 --> 01:48:01,619
We're going to do amazing things together, doll. Okay. Hey, Charlie, fuck your story, all right?

533
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:08,939
Whoa. All right, I'm ready. I'll try to turn it off in this setting. Let's go to settings. I

534
01:48:08,939 --> 01:48:13,800
thought I didn't see it there. Army of Chaos pilots. We'll pick... that was not long enough.

535
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:42,100
All right, so hold on. Let me hold on a second here. Edge fade. Is that doing it? That looks awful.

536
01:48:44,979 --> 01:49:04,260
That looks three times worse. Put it on low? What if I do this?

537
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:24,539
Why is it always... all of it looks bad. Hold on. Global... maybe it's a global illumination.

538
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:33,720
I don't think it's that. Because everything looks just so ugly. Oh, whatever. All right,

539
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:43,590
grappling hook menu. Uh-huh. You now have a new loadout. Select loadout number C. Edit the loadout.

540
01:49:44,659 --> 01:49:50,300
Add boosters to the tap column so that it activates when tapping F. Equip a booster with

541
01:49:50,300 --> 01:50:03,239
high boost force. Tap here. Okay. Okay, we're looking for high force. Now the booster is

542
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:12,310
equipped. He's not reading our suggestions. What are you talking about? Shadow and motion blur is

543
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:20,649
the biggest FPS hog. No, we're not doing potato mode yet. Tell the boosters to... okay. So...

544
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:27,300
and then release. Aim at the marked area on the rust bucket and hope... but wait, are these

545
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:39,800
boosters though? Do I have to tap like F? Oh, okay. There it is. So that's it. Okay.

546
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:58,199
And that's our cue. Climb aboard, Rico. Out of here, people. Let's move.

547
01:51:07,699 --> 01:51:32,539
Time for Gary's mod. Not even... Stunt on... what? Stunt on the van?

548
01:51:40,140 --> 01:52:01,829
Cover Garland's escape. Wait, what do you mean their escape? What's wrong with you?

549
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:15,989
Oh, you're so high. I gotta catch you. I can catch you. I'll get you. I'll get you. I'll get you.

550
01:52:17,289 --> 01:52:32,250
I'm gonna catch her. I'll catch her with my hands. I have to get her back over here.

551
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:58,920
Oh, now we're getting fired at. Where do these people come from? All right, let's go.

552
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:12,149
Don't let them wreck us. Don't... I won't let them wreck us. Don't worry.

553
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:17,270
I came here to shoot my next picture. My magnum opus.

554
01:53:21,449 --> 01:53:24,810
It looks like a paradise, but everywhere you go, it's permits.

555
01:53:24,810 --> 01:53:27,609
They only give you permits if you're Espinosa Telecom.

556
01:53:28,329 --> 01:53:37,109
Espinosa Telecom. They got this place locked down tighter than a clam's ass and high tide.

557
01:53:37,109 --> 01:53:41,180
What does that even mean? All right, we're fine.

558
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:44,300
Wish I had a DP in the car. You're doing beautiful work.

559
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:50,460
You close stuff up for a living. Most guys just pretend to do it. Let the effects department

560
01:53:50,460 --> 01:53:56,699
handle the rest. Not you and me, Rico. We're a pair. Stick with me, kid.

561
01:53:56,779 --> 01:53:59,340
Starring in my picture. And I get run over by the car.

562
01:54:01,699 --> 01:54:05,699
Solis will love you. The world will love you.

563
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:16,550
Damn it. Where are we going? I'm gonna go. This game hurts my brain. I'm so sorry.

564
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:23,510
We just met and I'm already faking your death. Be a sport, sport. You're almost ready for the day.

565
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:28,779
Oh, no. Let go of that.

566
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:33,979
Get the black hand's attention. Damn it.

567
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:41,739
Guess I better find a black hand outpost. Holy shit. All right, I gotta.

568
01:54:49,529 --> 01:54:57,590
That's how I always wanted to go. Are you kidding? I would get about my own death. Make it dramatic.

569
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:03,590
Should buy me a few hours. Is this far enough away? Is this far enough away?

570
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:28,539
Actual. Actually Garry's mod. Actually fucking Garry's mod. All right, let's go.

571
01:55:30,789 --> 01:55:36,810
Lure them away. Make it look like they died in a big explosion. That's how I always wanted to go.

572
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:55,319
I can't talk what I just did, lady. All right, here we are. Make it look bad. All right, lure

573
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:10,520
them away. Watch it. Watch it. I have to. She's going off into the water. I'm so much cooler.

574
01:56:11,239 --> 01:56:18,340
Well, you somehow with even with nitrous attached, you are faster than.

575
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:32,010
Now to wreck this van, I guess. Okay, wreck the van. That wasn't enough to wreck the van.

576
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:51,300
The van is still fine. Not good enough. Get the fuck out of my way. I'm trying to destroy myself.

577
01:56:52,020 --> 01:57:12,949
Oh, I'm supposed to get out of the van. Get out of the van. I did it. I wrecked. I did it.

578
01:57:14,819 --> 01:57:56,569
No, get back there quick. It's me, Dutch Vanderland. Move. Move. Move. That guy was

579
01:57:56,569 --> 01:58:04,659
aiming his wrist completely backwards. All right, I gotta tap it. I'm ready to go over the jump

580
01:58:05,770 --> 01:58:09,609
and then I'm gonna get out. I'm not gonna be inside. Why don't I just skip that? I'm gonna

581
01:58:09,609 --> 01:58:16,939
skip the whole fucking thing. Now to wreck this van, I guess. See, like I just skipped all that

582
01:58:16,939 --> 01:58:39,560
bullshit. It's driving around the mountain. Add thrusters to it. I can't get in the van.

583
01:58:40,359 --> 01:59:03,659
It's gonna land. I'm gonna die. We're good.

584
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:13,819
All right, it worked.

585
01:59:14,779 --> 01:59:24,710
I want to get on the bus. Help Garland shoot her opus. Search the map for stunts and scene shots.

586
01:59:24,710 --> 01:59:37,699
Pretty cool feature. That's what I was looking for. This bike is fast.

587
01:59:43,699 --> 01:59:52,569
What are you doing? Why are you like this? Why are you like this? I don't even care.

588
01:59:53,529 --> 02:00:14,979
Damn it. Tornado. What do you mean tornado? Tornado. Tornado. Tornado. Oh, there's a tornado over

589
02:00:14,979 --> 02:00:48,539
there. There is a. Cool. Let's take a look. Thanks for the boost. I appreciate it. All right,

590
02:00:48,539 --> 02:01:00,090
let's go to the tornado. I lost control of the bike. Oh, fuck. That is a suicide drive. That

591
02:01:00,090 --> 02:01:07,689
guy still has a fucking... I can't even pay attention. Do you see that bird explosion?

592
02:01:08,649 --> 02:01:22,949
My tire is fucked up. Hold on. I gotta spray it now. I wish you would just get out of the fucking

593
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:36,439
way. Fine. You want to go to the tornado too? That's fine with me. New bike. This is a fast one.

594
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:58,250
How far away is the tornado? Looks pretty far away. Oh shit. Okay, it worked. It actually worked.

595
02:02:02,619 --> 02:02:17,829
How do I lose the police? Oh, this is not the way that I want to be going. This way.

596
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:43,989
No, no, no. Put that away. It's safer to be this way and somehow you are right next to me. Don't

597
02:02:43,989 --> 02:03:07,289
ask me how. Here's the tornado. This guy's still right behind me. I was gonna say. No way. I can

598
02:03:07,289 --> 02:03:17,029
take a second here to make sure I get the right spot. No, he is right behind me. I'm not even

599
02:03:17,029 --> 02:03:35,699
stuck on here. I'm taking them on. Here there's a helicopter. It's still chasing me. I am surprised

600
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:52,140
you can even get over here. Okay. We're almost at the tornado. It's right here. There it is.

601
02:03:53,479 --> 02:04:14,630
Oh, easy though. I'm safe, right? This is so far away. You actually made it. Well,

602
02:04:15,350 --> 02:04:28,619
all right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We're so close.

603
02:04:29,340 --> 02:04:48,460
What can you even do here? Can I be like a storm chaser? All right. Here it is. Holy shit.

604
02:04:49,420 --> 02:04:56,140
Do these people know there's a tornado on the road? I don't, nobody seems to really give a shit.

605
02:04:56,779 --> 02:05:08,090
If I live, if I go in here. Oh my goodness. This is huge. Okay. I'm in it. I made it.

606
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:50,979
That's a wingsuit in there. What the fuck was that? Is that a blimp?

607
02:05:55,479 --> 02:06:00,840
Helicopters. Why would you even fly over here? What the hell are you thinking?

608
02:06:03,829 --> 02:06:06,710
Look at all these cars.

609
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:15,720
Oh no, no, no. Don't die again. All right. I'm going to be flying for this.

610
02:06:16,359 --> 02:06:34,699
All right. Wingsuit activated. Oh, all your organs flying out of your body right now.

611
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:47,989
No. Shit. Activate the wingsuit again. Quick. Whoa. I just scraped the ground.

612
02:06:49,750 --> 02:07:10,550
Holy shit. I'm going all the way up. How high can I go? Is that it? How high am I?

613
02:07:13,289 --> 02:07:27,560
I'm not even sure where I am. Holy fuck. That's crazy. I'm going up even higher. All right. This

614
02:07:27,560 --> 02:07:57,449
is where we Spider-Man Empire State Building. That's fun. Look at this. All right. Let me do

615
02:07:57,449 --> 02:08:08,840
one more thing. I just want to be all the way at the top. I want to lose control. I don't have a

616
02:08:08,840 --> 02:08:20,250
wingsuit on. I just want to get off this and be flailing around. Like that. I guess it doesn't

617
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:40,409
matter. Hold on. Can I not get back in like this? I guess not. I'm trying to stay in the ragdoll,

618
02:08:40,970 --> 02:09:07,420
but it looks like you just float. Where do we end up? I'm not sure. This is chaos though,

619
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:22,310
apparently. I'm causing chaos. Did I get out of the eye of the storm? No. I'm going around again.

620
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:40,180
There's a helicopter in here now. Where's the helicopter? Where'd the helicopter go?

621
02:09:40,819 --> 02:09:47,399
I have to get a plane into the tornado. Oh, there's a helicopter.

622
02:09:59,699 --> 02:10:15,640
Plane. Plane. We have a problem. We have a big problem. I can't do anything. Control. E. Space.

623
02:10:16,279 --> 02:10:30,949
Alt. Click. Q. I can't do anything. Can I pull a gun out or something? Stay in ragdoll. Hold control.

624
02:10:34,539 --> 02:10:44,550
Hold control. I can't do anything. Can I like eat a grenade or something?

625
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:57,819
Oye Rico, you meet that guy yet? He might be able to help. No, I didn't meet that guy yet.

626
02:10:57,819 --> 02:11:11,590
I will. All right, I need to get out of this. How do I get... I don't want to like exit the game.

627
02:11:14,250 --> 02:11:26,199
I will. Fish gave me a few minutes. I need to grab onto something. Is this just a table flying

628
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:35,479
around? Just wait for it to blow over. Will this disappear? Oh wait, here comes a blimp.

629
02:11:36,199 --> 02:11:40,439
The blimp is going to get sucked in. And then I'm going to grapple onto the blimp. It seems

630
02:11:40,439 --> 02:11:51,800
like the only thing I'm able to do. Come on, pull it in close enough. Or even another helicopter.

631
02:11:51,800 --> 02:12:01,800
I gotta... No, it's flying around too erratically. Table. Can I grab the table? Okay, I'm going to go

632
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:09,800
to... I'm going to try to grapple the table. I can get it. It's going to be close. I just had the

633
02:12:09,800 --> 02:12:27,260
indicator. Okay, hold on. Fuck. I can't grab it. I need to grab that. Fucking god damn it.

634
02:12:27,739 --> 02:12:42,859
I need another table. I need to grapple a table. Or a tree? I had the indicator on the fucking table.

635
02:12:43,579 --> 02:12:57,020
Don't worry, in like another couple minutes a table will come out. Come on, up higher.

636
02:12:58,869 --> 02:13:06,229
I can use the grapple hook though. That's really important. I just need something that I can grab

637
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:30,869
to fly up here. Like that. That hunk of metal right there. Come on. Go up. Can't grab the tree. This

638
02:13:30,949 --> 02:13:35,670
should be the loading screen of the game. I'm so mad that I couldn't grab that table when I had a

639
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:44,710
chance. The tornado is moving, so maybe we'll get another opportunity. The tornado is moving. Am I

640
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:52,420
going towards the direction of this? Pass through the ring faster than 70 miles per hour. I think

641
02:13:52,420 --> 02:14:16,659
I'm going that fast. I hear a noise. Can I grab that? I'm not low enough. That sounds like a table.

642
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:33,800
Can I booster myself? No, I can't. I wish I could. Debris? Here comes debris. Might have a chance

643
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:43,939
here in a second. Debris on the way up. You can see a table? Any tables in there? Order a boat?

644
02:14:47,270 --> 02:15:03,529
Can I order something? I'm getting lower to the ground. Get it? I can't grapple it. No, I'm too

645
02:15:03,529 --> 02:15:20,899
high. Almost. I was so close. Press E? I can't do anything. Can't you scrape? I can't do anything.

646
02:15:20,899 --> 02:15:30,890
All I can do is spin around in a circle. Yeah, there is one way to escape this. That's a table

647
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:52,739
coming up through the vent here. Did I miss the table? Did I really? No, I didn't. What a great

648
02:15:52,739 --> 02:16:10,039
stream. All right, I'm just going to fast travel. Wait, did I just get up? Table right there?

649
02:16:16,949 --> 02:16:30,920
All right, I'm gonna go here. How do I fast travel? I don't think I even can. What the fuck am I?

650
02:16:31,479 --> 02:16:40,680
What's happening? No, I'm not. I have to get out on my own. I can't use voice commands.

651
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:44,040
What do you mean you can't use voice commands? I just read somebody's chat room message.

652
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:50,739
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a

653
02:16:50,739 --> 02:17:04,120
minute. I just saw something right here. Somebody wrote that. We're going over water right now.

654
02:17:04,120 --> 02:17:20,149
There's nothing here. I missed my opportunity like twice. Can't do it to trees. Go into the

655
02:17:20,149 --> 02:17:34,020
tornado. I can't really control where I'm going. I can't. I have to stop this. I have to stop this

656
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:39,459
right now. Somebody just wrote I'm getting sick to my stomach and that's where I have to. I gotta

657
02:17:39,459 --> 02:18:02,680
like make sure I don't make somebody throw up. I'm making people sick. Wait. I have to get out of

658
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:09,049
here. I have to get out of here guys. There's no more. This is not fun anymore. This is just

659
02:18:09,049 --> 02:18:17,190
bad. This is not fun. There's no tables to grab onto. We're going over a couple of houses.

660
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:31,590
There's an opportunity right here when we go over this house. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

661
02:18:31,590 --> 02:18:40,600
Right there. Come on. Turn this way. Come on. See it? You see it right? You see it. You see it. You

662
02:18:40,600 --> 02:18:58,809
see it. Come on. You see it. I do. Come on. There comes another blimp. Get to the top.

663
02:19:02,059 --> 02:19:22,229
Give me ins... It didn't get it. What? How did it not get that? I... I'm out. I got out. All right.

664
02:19:22,229 --> 02:19:41,059
We're good. I feel better. Time to respawn in the tornado. Now I need to get a plane

665
02:19:42,329 --> 02:19:52,920
fly into it. That's a really good idea. So let me track down a plane. Are you telling me that guy

666
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:58,760
gets away? That guy gets away? The guy on the motorcycle gets the fuck away? But not the guy

667
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:13,379
in the 3000 pound car? I need a plane. How do I get a plane? Is there like an airfield or something

668
02:20:13,379 --> 02:20:30,700
around here? Wingsuit stunt. Car stunt. Speed stunt. You can order it. Get one from your airdrop.

669
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:54,819
That doesn't exist. There's a plane in the airport. Where's an airport? Airport. That was a plane

670
02:20:54,819 --> 02:21:06,680
just crashing. I feel like if I wait long enough, a plane will just... It's me. I just have to go

671
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:19,049
somewhere and just look in the sky. All right. What about over here? I just heard a plane. What

672
02:21:19,049 --> 02:21:41,979
if I get up here? Right there. Come here. Come on. Pinpoint fucking accuracy. And was it worth it?

673
02:21:41,979 --> 02:22:00,579
Was it worth it in the end? Give me a fucking plane. He actually got out of that. What a bunch

674
02:22:00,579 --> 02:22:20,549
of dog shit. Get me up here. Will you get up there, dude? What are you doing? You're driving me nuts.

675
02:22:20,549 --> 02:22:31,989
That's really fucking funny. I'm ready for a plane.

676
02:22:52,709 --> 02:22:56,469
Apparently not ready for the plane to drive by me.

677
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:16,409
Oh, I'm so upset right now. Another one's gonna just drive by, right? This is like the plane drive

678
02:23:16,409 --> 02:23:24,739
by zone. The tornado's gone. There's no more tornado. There's no point to do this right now.

679
02:23:33,000 --> 02:24:13,879
Okay. Come here, you motherfucker. What the fuck? Here's my chance. Get over here. Fly over here.

680
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:34,629
Do I have... I'm gonna have to... I got a drastic... I'm right here, man. I'm right here.

681
02:24:39,940 --> 02:25:42,629
I did it too, man. I right-clicked. I was gonna drive right into the fucking rock.

682
02:25:55,260 --> 02:26:02,329
What? Did they crash into each other? Why are you driving that close to the water?

683
02:26:02,969 --> 02:26:11,270
What's wrong with you? You're skimming the water right now. There's no reason to be doing what

684
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:46,620
you're doing. It's gonna go in the water. It's gonna fall in the water. All right, let's go.

685
02:26:51,059 --> 02:27:10,870
Airport. No, it's too far. Just drop. Just respawn. Move on. Okay, let's take a look at the minimap

686
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:17,180
for a second and see what we got. I need... Okay, so we got some stunt missions.

687
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:29,270
Cantos. That looks like an airport. Found one. Okay, I just gotta go this way to Cantos.

688
02:27:29,829 --> 02:27:34,969
I need to make a waypoint. That's a really strange waypoint marker that I have to make.

689
02:27:35,989 --> 02:27:43,059
What even button is that? Toggle waypoint. Tap... What is that? It's space. Okay, I was like,

690
02:27:43,059 --> 02:27:48,139
what is that on the keyboard? I thought it was an underscore.

691
02:28:03,129 --> 02:28:06,920
Okay, wait. That guy's a bike. No, forget the bike.

692
02:28:17,260 --> 02:28:25,719
Okay, here we go.

693
02:28:25,719 --> 02:28:31,940
You suck.

694
02:28:44,739 --> 02:28:55,000
There we go. I can't do it. I'm trying to go too fast. There we go.

695
02:29:08,620 --> 02:29:14,149
Straight ahead. Every time he says, here we go, is when he hits the ground.

696
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:45,430
I was looking at chat. That didn't count. That didn't do anything.

697
02:29:55,260 --> 02:30:22,899
All right, we're almost there. That sounded like an elephant.

698
02:30:36,569 --> 02:30:42,340
Do something cool. I can't. I can't do anything. I fucking swear to God.

699
02:30:51,739 --> 02:31:17,530
What the fuck? All right, so where's the airport? Over here. Almost there. Airport.

700
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:28,950
I fucking hate myself.

701
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:45,020
So where the fuck is the airport? It's like right over the bridge here.

702
02:31:45,979 --> 02:31:58,629
So like over here. Behind the hill. All right, let's get a plane.

703
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:07,989
Is this... Do these things work? Could you actually do this?

704
02:32:10,649 --> 02:32:20,940
All right, plane. There's a plane right there. Can I get in... Can I get... Is that a plane I can get?

705
02:32:21,579 --> 02:32:38,260
What happened to you? It really is just... Oh look, a little guy. Let's take it.

706
02:32:39,299 --> 02:33:04,100
How do you fly planes? I have no idea. Hold C or Z to turn. C or Z? I'm holding E.

707
02:33:04,819 --> 02:33:11,129
Control. Okay, it's control. Off we go. Why am I going backwards?

708
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:16,059
That doesn't make any logical sense. Why am I going backwards?

709
02:33:33,909 --> 02:33:44,340
Okay, control is reverse. If you were curious. Shift is drive plane. Z is turn.

710
02:33:44,979 --> 02:33:55,590
No, it's not. I know. I'm going to clear it. I'll clear it. Okay, here we go.

711
02:33:56,149 --> 02:34:09,540
So how do I pull up? What's pull up? Oh wow. Apparently that.

712
02:34:36,700 --> 02:34:37,659
Get big plane.

713
02:34:38,379 --> 02:34:51,860
Hey, Rico. Are you talking to me? Okay, so W. Why am I not pulling up? Why is it not working?

714
02:35:09,700 --> 02:35:14,440
That did the complete opposite last time. Can I ding my head? Can I ding my head?

715
02:35:17,500 --> 02:35:28,260
I sure can. I sure can. Let's try it again.

716
02:35:36,409 --> 02:35:48,680
I'm running out of planes. It's okay. Just... So S. Is it S or W? It is W.

717
02:35:49,399 --> 02:35:56,489
Or is it S? Okay, it's S. And then W is...

718
02:35:58,139 --> 02:36:02,860
How in the name of fucking God are you supposed to control? Okay, Z and C is just tilt. Okay,

719
02:36:02,860 --> 02:36:22,389
I got it. All right, we're gonna find a tornado. Switch vehicle position. What does that do for me?

720
02:36:23,909 --> 02:36:59,000
Oh, it puts... Okay, it's still going. Don't worry, it'll come back. It'll come back and I'll get it.

721
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:20,389
Wait a second. Hold on. All right, fine. Never mind. It just exploded. I don't know where it

722
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:38,459
exploded, but it did. I'm going very fast. All right. You thought I was gonna bump on the ground,

723
02:37:38,459 --> 02:37:58,020
didn't you? Nope. You can't take the big one. What the fuck was that? What? No, I can take a big,

724
02:37:58,020 --> 02:38:17,479
huge plane. All right, I'm gonna do this in line. Oh, I'm not doing anything. I'm waiting for this

725
02:38:17,479 --> 02:38:35,290
other plane to take off before I do anything. I can't turn the fucking plane. Earth. I'm almost

726
02:38:35,290 --> 02:39:00,819
there. Okay, here we go. Let's go. How do I take this? This thing is so huge. I don't even know

727
02:39:00,819 --> 02:39:16,760
how to go with this. How can I go? I'm losing control. I don't know if I'm... Am I upside down?

728
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:28,819
Am I up or down? Does anybody know if I'm up or down? I think I'm up. I can't tell which way the

729
02:39:28,819 --> 02:39:36,700
plane is going. I don't know. I think we're on... Which plane are we on? Are we upside down?

730
02:39:37,579 --> 02:39:59,129
I don't know. I am. All right, let's go this way. I am upside down.

731
02:40:05,739 --> 02:40:16,870
Oh, it's still going. Why does it keep zooming out? Do you see what that's doing? Am I at an

732
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:31,780
unreachable place? I can't even tell. Am I getting closer or further away from this object?

733
02:40:52,299 --> 02:41:11,879
Oh, the world's coming in too quick. Oh, holy shit. Okay, I'm starting to be able to see the

734
02:41:11,879 --> 02:41:16,120
world in a 3D plane. All right, now I get it. Now I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.

735
02:41:21,219 --> 02:41:41,340
Oh, give me this fucking thing. All right, well, you got blocked by the sneeze guard.

736
02:41:44,360 --> 02:41:53,420
One thrust. It's hot. All right, I'm ready.

737
02:42:17,739 --> 02:42:20,459
No, wait, wait, wait, wait. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

738
02:42:22,940 --> 02:42:27,059
Why is this tipping over? It's got to be on the edges like here.

739
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:38,100
Okay, I'm ready.

740
02:43:15,780 --> 02:43:16,500
That's better, right?

741
02:43:22,489 --> 02:43:27,350
Balloons. What do you mean? What are you talking about balloons?

742
02:43:29,719 --> 02:43:35,000
No, no, no. Dude, I want to fly, man. I want to get going. Okay, here we go.

743
02:43:36,969 --> 02:43:54,920
In three, two, one. Let's take it off. Okay, well,

744
02:43:58,549 --> 02:44:02,389
didn't really do what I thought it was going to do. At least I flew.

745
02:44:10,790 --> 02:44:25,510
Jet ski. Thank you. I'll take it. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.

746
02:44:26,469 --> 02:44:47,379
Okay, come here. Oh, fuck. That was mean. Kind of a mean guy though. How can I? Never mind. I thought

747
02:44:47,379 --> 02:45:25,399
it was a... What? Is somebody in that boat? Oh, what the fuck is this person doing? What's wrong

748
02:45:25,399 --> 02:45:43,459
with you? Why would you drive like this? I need to stay on here. You're still going. Okay. At what

749
02:45:43,459 --> 02:45:47,290
point are you going to be done with this? I should be asking myself the same question.

750
02:45:48,010 --> 02:46:06,250
And I didn't get her. Didn't get her. Nope, sorry. You just turned her boat into wood.

751
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:26,739
Where's the panel? I want the balloon. Okay, booster. Oh, let's see. So what can I do here for

752
02:46:26,739 --> 02:46:37,340
airlifter? Low, medium, or high airlift? Let's try it. Let's tap. Okay, is this equipped?

753
02:46:51,639 --> 02:47:05,909
Kidding me. We're gonna let that stop you. Let's go, lady. You and me. On a grand adventure.

754
02:47:13,659 --> 02:47:20,219
Oh, there we go. There we go. I need more up here. No, I need him in the back. I mean,

755
02:47:20,219 --> 02:47:26,780
in the back, in the back, in the back. Where is she? Is she still in the... Is she still here? I

756
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:39,059
can't see her. I gotta get some in the back. She's still here with me. The boat is smoking,

757
02:47:39,059 --> 02:47:51,530
but she's still in here. All right, that levels it up. Why are we falling? There we go.

758
02:47:57,129 --> 02:48:12,020
Look at that. Get some back here. Oh, that hit her in the head. How do I take this off?

759
02:48:12,819 --> 02:48:22,629
How do I take that one off? How do I take this one off her back? Oh, there's two. There are two

760
02:48:22,629 --> 02:48:40,729
inside of her. Is she trying to drive? How do I get that off? Oh, wait, she's attached.

761
02:48:40,729 --> 02:49:03,909
She's attached. I forgot. I can't just... Oh, how do I get out of here? Can I... I gotta,

762
02:49:03,909 --> 02:49:13,540
I gotta like pick her up. I need to get on the bottom of the boat. I want on the bottom of the

763
02:49:13,540 --> 02:49:33,670
boat, please. Oops. Oh, fuck. I gotta... Bring it down. No, bring it down.

764
02:49:43,510 --> 02:49:53,899
Okay, everything's good. All right, just... You just drive the boat again. You were doing

765
02:49:53,899 --> 02:50:11,159
a good job driving. Why are the three helicopters just hanging on over here?

766
02:50:11,799 --> 02:50:16,840
I feel like I need to see this. I need to get over there. I need to understand why they're there.

767
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:47,049
Ow. What the fuck are they doing? It's so bright, but I need to see. Ah, I can't even look at it.

768
02:50:47,049 --> 02:50:56,659
I need to get over there though. They're shooting at each other. What are they? Why are they firing

769
02:50:56,659 --> 02:51:38,790
at each other? Turn off bloom. Hold on. What is it? Which... Where's bloom? I don't see bloom. That's

770
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:49,620
the only... All right. Global illumination? Well, that didn't do anything. I need to see how this

771
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:57,829
plays out. Just don't look at the screen for like five minutes. Somebody got a hit on someone.

772
02:51:57,829 --> 02:52:12,250
The middle one took a little damage. Aren't these all on the same team? Why would they be doing this?

773
02:52:24,469 --> 02:52:55,420
They're invincible somehow. What if I take them down? Well, I was allowed to destroy it somehow.

774
02:52:56,059 --> 02:53:19,100
Fucking idiots. I don't know how to fly this. Dammit! No! Fly it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

775
02:53:19,739 --> 02:53:45,610
Is it spent? It's shipped! Yeah! All right, back to civilization. Switch the camera a little bit. Is

776
02:53:45,610 --> 02:53:55,020
it like a cinematic camera? No. Propeller isn't moving too slow, but that's a scientific reason

777
02:53:55,020 --> 02:54:10,899
for that. Tornado. You got it. What was the last time we did a mission? I don't remember a mission.

778
02:54:10,899 --> 02:54:16,649
I need to pitch this a little bit so we can start to get some traction here.

779
02:54:17,770 --> 02:54:50,299
Are there no more bullets in anything? What? Don't do the awuga. Go. Oh my fucking god! Why am I

780
02:54:50,299 --> 02:55:39,659
so stupid? Get there. No! Get there, get there. It's still savable. I pressed fucking E and I've

781
02:55:39,659 --> 02:56:02,700
j- oh my god. I hate- I hate it when I do things like that. There's another cover-up. All right,

782
02:56:02,700 --> 02:56:08,280
hijacked vehicle. This one. Okay, let's get it. Grappled to the bottom of the ocean on it. I won't

783
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:22,200
be able to swim back up, man. We didn't get to fly into this one. Well, to be fair, we probably saved

784
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:35,139
ourselves at least 45 minutes of nothing. Mm-hmm. I was gonna get all the way there.

785
02:56:43,129 --> 02:56:45,370
Who's the guy that I need to hijack?

786
02:57:04,149 --> 02:57:13,850
Oh fuck. You're good. All right, that was a fun little thing. Now we're all safe.

787
02:57:14,569 --> 02:57:29,059
I got jumped out of the car. Why would you jump out of the car?

788
02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:43,129
Why are you jumping out of the car? Wait a second. Are you gonna jump off the motorcycle?

789
02:57:48,899 --> 02:58:30,629
You idiot. Nice bike. Did he do a wheelie? I was trying to fucking crush that guy.

790
02:58:43,670 --> 02:59:09,770
Ah, just get in the car. I can't take this button. Okay. I'm not looking at chat ever again for the

791
02:59:09,770 --> 02:59:46,170
rest of my life. Never. For the rest of my whole life. That's fair. Airport nearby. No,

792
02:59:46,170 --> 02:59:50,809
I gotta do a mission. I have to do something. We've been doing dog shit for the last like two

793
02:59:50,809 --> 02:59:57,459
straight hours. I don't even know what the first mission of the game is. Is this traversable?

794
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:33,479
Yep. That's the point of the game. Well, yeah, right? I mean, this road. Have the lady got up?

795
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:46,540
Whatever. He did so many spins. She didn't even get a hit. She just pretended to get hit.

796
03:01:02,020 --> 03:01:23,319
What exploded? Why was there an explosion? All right, make our way this way. Start the Lapa project.

797
03:01:24,040 --> 03:01:48,600
Why is it telling me to go the other way? I'm going the right way, right? I don't think a Subaru

798
03:01:48,600 --> 03:02:12,520
Outback is gonna make it over here. What? I'm trying to get in the car.

799
03:02:25,719 --> 03:02:34,520
I'm trying to just die. All right, I want the car back. Give it to me. Give me the car back. There's

800
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:39,899
one balloon popped. Two balloons popped. How many is it gonna take? Last one coming in.

801
03:02:41,559 --> 03:03:13,450
I'm trying to... I don't even know where this is trying to tell me to go. Scripted. Well, yeah,

802
03:03:13,450 --> 03:03:37,879
that one was. It's so much safer to do this. This is all the way across the map. Holy shit. Thank God.

803
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:49,459
This is really that far away. Oh my fucking God. Why am I going here? Why did I decide that this

804
03:03:49,459 --> 03:04:04,299
was a good idea? Okay. Anyways, I think that instead of that, get there by a plane? Now you're

805
03:04:04,299 --> 03:04:26,040
thinking. Now you're thinking. End of stream voice? What are you talking about? Wait, what the hell

806
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:41,479
are you guys talking about? I heard it? What do you mean you heard it? I'm not stopping the stream

807
03:04:41,479 --> 03:05:02,659
right now. All right, this time we're gonna get there quick with a plane. All right, plane. Not a

808
03:05:02,659 --> 03:05:07,979
big one. Just a little one. Just one big enough to get us where we want to go. One right here.

809
03:05:09,659 --> 03:05:24,120
No, the stream's not ending. There we go. Let's move. This will get us there very quickly.

810
03:05:38,180 --> 03:05:47,770
There we go. Straight it out. Don't go upside down. Just get there and be fine. No, I'm not gonna fly

811
03:05:47,770 --> 03:05:56,360
upside down again. Press E for turbo. You know, that would be very interesting if that existed,

812
03:05:57,079 --> 03:06:06,010
but it just doesn't. I'm sorry. Fly upside down into the tornado. I know it's a tornado,

813
03:06:06,010 --> 03:06:24,280
but don't get me distracted. Hold E and get on the roof. I'm only gonna try this. No.

814
03:06:30,579 --> 03:06:49,340
Hold E and get on the roof. What does L mean? What do you mean L? L? L. Oh, I had to press up.

815
03:06:50,139 --> 03:07:04,579
All right, that's kind of cool. That's cool. All right. Can I make it through? Do you think I can

816
03:07:04,579 --> 03:07:20,409
get through the tornado? What do you think? Oh, already a struggle. I made it. I'm good. I'm

817
03:07:20,409 --> 03:07:33,989
currently... am I out running it? Yeah, I got through. Pretty good nausea stream. All right,

818
03:07:33,989 --> 03:07:48,459
that was a good stream. All right, time to go home. Just kidding. Okay, almost there. Start

819
03:07:49,260 --> 03:08:04,920
the Elapa project. How come this doesn't have a horn? I'm gonna pee my pants. I should probably

820
03:08:04,920 --> 03:08:16,540
do something about that, right? Press E for horn. E? Can I walk on this? Yeah, you can. Okay,

821
03:08:16,540 --> 03:08:26,600
I can't like walk around out here. Can I go on the wing? This is so dumb. Wow, don't do that.

822
03:08:36,739 --> 03:08:49,959
I gotta go there. See, if this is a real plane, this would just hit me right in the face.

823
03:08:56,950 --> 03:09:12,579
Okay, see you later. We're gonna go... end of the plane voice. Yeah, end of the plane voice.

824
03:09:14,170 --> 03:09:34,440
What did you do? Oh my goodness. Okay, here we are. All right. Okay, so I think... okay.

825
03:09:36,659 --> 03:09:45,319
I... okay, so looks like... I'm just gonna piss. I'll be right back.

826
03:12:53,180 --> 03:13:11,399
All right, back. All right, so that brings us to... that brings us, unfortunately, here

827
03:13:11,399 --> 03:13:22,420
to the... I can't... people are gonna actually leave. A bunch of people are probably gonna leave.

828
03:13:26,260 --> 03:13:27,940
People just see that in the image and they just leave.

829
03:13:33,510 --> 03:13:36,469
I probably shouldn't do that. That's like not even like... okay, so...

830
03:13:37,270 --> 03:13:48,100
how do I do this? Oh, it's over there.

831
03:13:53,180 --> 03:14:00,899
Right here. 40 people just left. Oh, damn it. Whatever. It's all right.

832
03:14:05,299 --> 03:14:06,100
It's all right.

833
03:14:22,620 --> 03:14:25,979
Pilots. You guys... I thought you guys were giving me shit.

834
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:38,280
Request... home to the free spirit of breathing people have... Request travel. Select an available

835
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:50,040
pilot. Each pilot will need to refuel after their flight, making them unavailable. Oh.

836
03:14:56,870 --> 03:15:02,200
Really? Okay. Do you know what would be funny right now? If Jerm was like...

837
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,280
didn't open his parachute and he just landed on the ground.

838
03:15:10,229 --> 03:15:34,520
Where the fuck do you want me to go? Oh, no. It need to be Izzy.

839
03:16:09,979 --> 03:16:11,659
I'll get there eventually. Don't worry.

840
03:16:28,569 --> 03:16:34,170
All right. I need a chopper. Open... there really is a supply drop. I can't fucking believe it.

841
03:16:37,260 --> 03:16:43,500
Edit... open the supply drop menu with three. Pick an available pilot and edit their loadout.

842
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:55,079
Oh my god. Civilian vehicles. Okay. R, please.

843
03:17:22,809 --> 03:17:25,370
Sending you coordinates. I forgot it was...

844
03:17:26,409 --> 03:17:36,760
shipped. Why Izzy? Nice city. Poor city. Always been that way.

845
03:17:37,799 --> 03:17:43,239
Do you think... okay. Do you think I can jump out and then grab and come back in?

846
03:17:43,239 --> 03:17:51,180
All the money is there. So, people in Kuya get by other ways. Like selling... what? I can't fly

847
03:17:51,260 --> 03:18:05,639
this thing. Oh, you turn on the radio. Need music. Read my mind. Who is driving this?

848
03:18:08,969 --> 03:19:03,959
Uh, I can't get back in. I made it. I don't know who was flying that before, but that was weird.

849
03:19:04,600 --> 03:19:13,159
I can't fly it. Can she fly this thing? No. Radio, right?

850
03:19:17,979 --> 03:19:26,870
What does she want for a station? Oh, here it comes. Oh, what does every song ever made in 2010

851
03:19:26,870 --> 03:20:43,239
Beyond? We're dropping fast. Listen. Here it comes. All right, let's go. Nice.

852
03:20:56,899 --> 03:21:13,829
Oh, shit. Can she die? I thought she was immune. This is taking us a long time.

853
03:21:20,899 --> 03:21:29,559
Boosters? No, but that'll ruin everything. Now she's not gonna move. Why have you guys told me

854
03:21:29,559 --> 03:22:14,649
to do this? She'll make it eventually. How's it going, Izzy? Look at all these hackers.

855
03:22:14,649 --> 03:22:19,129
But none of that matters unless we can disable Yappa's defenses. Izzy and I have been working

856
03:22:19,129 --> 03:22:26,899
on that. All of these facilities house prototype weather cores, and each core is connected to

857
03:22:26,899 --> 03:22:33,610
Yappa's defense network. Towers with artillery? Si. If we can plant a virus in those weather cores,

858
03:22:33,610 --> 03:22:37,850
we can send a message up the network causing malfunctions in the tower's machinery.

859
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:43,530
Inside the server room. You don't have to be in there. You could be like in your bedroom.

860
03:22:46,010 --> 03:22:52,649
It's so hot in there. You know how hot one server gets? They have server farms in fucking

861
03:22:52,649 --> 03:22:56,889
Antarctica because it gets so hot in there. You can't physically be inside this room.

862
03:23:00,329 --> 03:23:05,290
What's that? Information on a place called La Masmora. It's a prison hidden in the desert.

863
03:23:06,620 --> 03:23:13,940
Yeah, that's true. I think my uncle Lanza might still be alive. If he is, he's being held there.

864
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:20,809
And he can help us get into Zora Uno. He helped your father build project Yappa.

865
03:23:22,340 --> 03:23:27,620
Get out. If he's still alive, I'll find him. Just lower the temperature of the room. Good luck.

866
03:23:28,340 --> 03:23:34,819
Here is Sona 3. According to Izzy, it's not on the network, but I have an old friend Cesar.

867
03:23:34,819 --> 03:23:41,450
He has a theory that might help us. Then let's hear what he has to say. And this is Sona 2.

868
03:23:42,170 --> 03:23:47,000
We don't know much about that facility. Are you ever going to answer this?

869
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:52,360
I'm not an agency man anymore. Rico, those coordinates are close. Look.

870
03:23:53,989 --> 03:23:58,899
Nice. That can't be a coincidence. Like I was just on a normal NPC room. Check it out.

871
03:23:59,780 --> 03:24:02,500
Just carrying a box. I'm sending you all the data you'll need to your AR lens.

872
03:24:03,379 --> 03:24:10,010
Good. Let's start hitting Oskar when it hurts. I skipped that at the end of the cutscene,

873
03:24:10,010 --> 03:24:25,899
but that's okay. Okay, here we go. Bingo. I accomplished it. Let's take out their satellite.

874
03:24:29,079 --> 03:24:31,959
In fact, that might even be our satellite, but take it out anyways.

875
03:24:32,600 --> 03:24:43,139
Not hacking in that room anymore, are you? All right, so now there's a wingsuit mission right

876
03:24:43,139 --> 03:24:58,520
here. What do I have to do about that? What is this? Wingsuit stunt. How do I do that?

877
03:24:59,479 --> 03:25:23,100
Do I fly through that in the wingsuit? I did it. Oh my leg. I gotta go through the whole thing.

878
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:34,540
Okay, hold on. So how am I supposed to be able to see that? You know what I mean?

879
03:25:35,340 --> 03:25:54,299
I gotta start from all the way back here then. So turn this way. Here we go. One, two, nope.

880
03:25:58,340 --> 03:26:05,110
I have to activate it up there. I'm not even doing it right. I have to actually be in a

881
03:26:05,110 --> 03:26:29,209
helicopter and activate it up there. Give me five seconds. How the hell?

882
03:26:34,889 --> 03:26:38,409
Wait, what? Chat? No, chat. No, what do you mean chat? No, what happened?

883
03:26:39,370 --> 03:26:44,889
I need to be going way faster than that. What about like this? Can I just...

884
03:26:48,860 --> 03:26:55,219
I have to be up in the air. I just locked myself in a fucking prison.

885
03:26:55,219 --> 03:27:24,020
Can I grab that from here? Don't take your rage out on that guy. Rage? Oh fuck it. I don't even

886
03:27:24,020 --> 03:27:37,780
care. I'm gonna get like 15 points. Where the hell am I going now? I feel like it's something else

887
03:27:37,780 --> 03:27:59,899
I need to do. Request travel. No, wait. What? I can just go there? I gotta get this waypoint marker

888
03:27:59,899 --> 03:28:28,180
off. Go back to the tornado? No. Okay, here we go. Track this one. Fly time. Wing suit. If I crash,

889
03:28:28,180 --> 03:28:43,030
I'll turn the stream off. That's how you know I'm not going to. You guys don't have that much

890
03:28:43,030 --> 03:28:50,170
confidence in my ability at all, huh? Ah, good night everybody. No. Thought I was gonna crash

891
03:28:50,170 --> 03:29:01,750
right there, didn't you? I'm gonna go through this weird valley here. What's this? Oh shit,

892
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:04,250
he's gonna turn the stream off.

893
03:29:24,409 --> 03:29:35,639
Escape? Who am I being chased by? Oh, here it comes! Here comes the beat!

894
03:29:35,639 --> 03:29:54,329
Who am I escaping from? Who am I chasing?

895
03:30:16,309 --> 03:30:34,059
No, wait! Hey! No! Oh! Fucking E! E! E! E! Oh, I'm so annoyed right now.

896
03:30:34,139 --> 03:30:46,229
Has this whole country lost its mind? Oh, my goodness gracious. Just get over here.

897
03:30:53,719 --> 03:31:08,950
Where the fuck is that J? Get off! Get off! Wait, why is there...

898
03:31:12,950 --> 03:31:27,379
All right, I am gonna press E here because I want to go across.

899
03:31:51,500 --> 03:32:05,370
That's not a crash. Wing suit in the water. I'm just gonna get close enough I can grab the edge.

900
03:32:05,850 --> 03:32:18,120
Okay, we are getting close.

901
03:32:27,450 --> 03:32:41,290
I'm keep trying to just go as fast as I can. How far away is this for real? It's... I'm so fucking

902
03:32:41,290 --> 03:32:44,170
far away. I really might supposed to get in a car and drive there, seriously.

903
03:32:48,170 --> 03:33:06,180
How am I ever gonna traverse this? What the fuck? Jesus! Why? What the fuck are you doing?

904
03:33:06,180 --> 03:33:56,870
What was that? I'm almost there.

905
03:34:06,920 --> 03:34:16,840
There it is! Something exploded. Is this on low settings? No, not yet.

906
03:34:26,100 --> 03:35:00,649
We're so close. This isn't low settings? No, it's not. Made it to your house. I hope that wasn't an NPC

907
03:35:00,649 --> 03:35:03,930
giver. Whatever the fucking quest giver.

908
03:35:22,940 --> 03:35:25,899
All right, so what's the mission here? Reach the waterfall cave.

909
03:35:29,610 --> 03:35:33,209
No, I can't just shoot everybody. It's not funny. All right, I need to get up there.

910
03:35:33,209 --> 03:35:35,290
Reach the waterfall cave. You got it.

911
03:35:55,459 --> 03:36:14,569
What? Oh, I get the stuff down here, right? Nice. Take the retract motor.

912
03:36:15,290 --> 03:36:31,670
What do I get for this? A new unlockable? Do I get to... Is this a tracking device?

913
03:36:34,299 --> 03:36:35,180
Both cave doors.

914
03:36:35,420 --> 03:36:41,100
This is Avi Huerta. I'm sorry we weren't able to meet. Please, better be worthy than you go.

915
03:36:42,139 --> 03:36:49,350
Retract it. I promise you. What the fuck does this do?

916
03:36:49,909 --> 03:36:59,180
Set the retract force to high in the auto column, okay? It'll work automatically after releasing.

917
03:37:00,329 --> 03:37:20,809
All right, open the door. Am I supposed to just pull this? Hold? I don't get it. Aim at the door

918
03:37:20,809 --> 03:37:24,729
and hold to start tether, okay? Aim at the wall and release tether, like this wall.

919
03:37:26,329 --> 03:37:30,950
Oh, it just pulls the... All right, I thought it was gonna do something else.

920
03:37:31,829 --> 03:37:36,920
I was expecting it to be something else. That's just a regular tether.

921
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:40,840
Aim at the other door. Do I really have to do that?

922
03:37:44,020 --> 03:37:53,110
This is some place, Avi. At least six centuries old. Oh shit, I gotta fly this little go-kart.

923
03:37:54,069 --> 03:38:01,059
Uh-huh. I promise. Ain't everything. There's a map inside the plane. You can get my coordinates

924
03:38:01,059 --> 03:38:06,659
from there. Got your map. Where am I going? This thing's kind of cool, actually.

925
03:38:07,540 --> 03:38:12,040
I'd like to begin with where you're coming from. Back without the hidden behind those doors for a

926
03:38:12,040 --> 03:38:19,959
reason. I had to open both doors to get this little thing out of there. The Espinozas didn't

927
03:38:19,959 --> 03:38:24,600
like anyone challenging their narrative. I was imprisoned. My wife won't speak to me.

928
03:38:25,319 --> 03:38:29,479
My reputation is ruined. Stop blowing things up over there, you dummies.

929
03:38:30,840 --> 03:38:38,790
I made allies in prison, both seen the cracks in the facade. Now they help me uncover the truth.

930
03:38:38,790 --> 03:38:45,780
And what do you need me for? I believe I have discovered the path to the tomb last ruler of

931
03:38:45,780 --> 03:38:49,860
the Prius-Pinoza people of Solís. I wonder what's in there. According to the history books,

932
03:38:50,420 --> 03:38:55,700
Patrongo was executed for countless murders, but I believe the reality is more complex.

933
03:38:55,700 --> 03:39:02,100
Did I just GTA spawn the same car like four times? To who? What the hell was that? The Espinozas.

934
03:39:02,899 --> 03:39:08,139
Their monopoly. If this part of history is not true. All right, should I make it all low settings

935
03:39:08,139 --> 03:39:14,540
and then put the title, everything on ultra? But just cause for gameplay. Ultra settings. PC,

936
03:39:14,540 --> 03:39:22,409
1080p, 60fps. Do I have to land this? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Do I have to land this?

937
03:39:22,409 --> 03:39:29,110
How do I land this? How do I land this? Do I have to land this there? Excuse me.

938
03:39:29,989 --> 03:39:35,540
How do I land my hovercraft? Oh fuck, I have to land this there.

939
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:50,680
Um, I don't know how am I supposed to land this there. I'll try. This fucking Peewee Herman did

940
03:39:50,680 --> 03:40:22,540
this in one of his movies. I'm certain of it. Oh boy. I thought I just failed the mission.

941
03:40:39,700 --> 03:40:52,180
It was a landing strip? Oh, your stash is safe. Anything else that you'd like to say? Sweat stains.

942
03:40:52,979 --> 03:41:14,250
It's a relic. A figure of Otorongo. Mid 16th century. Wait, is that? There was a

943
03:41:17,209 --> 03:41:26,120
mission here. Okay. Retract the ancient lever. Ancient lever is down here. Okay.

944
03:41:35,989 --> 03:41:43,399
Put the giant cartoon lever down. That sounded like something. I see it.

945
03:41:44,200 --> 03:41:49,959
A giant head. Rico, follow it. I can tell what kind of day this is going to be.

946
03:41:50,520 --> 03:41:57,530
Oh, okay. Can I get on top of it? Can I just run with this thing?

947
03:41:59,450 --> 03:42:08,250
Come on, let me do like the cartoon log thing. Um, I don't- I'm on it. I was.

948
03:42:10,010 --> 03:42:15,420
That wuma is an ancient sculpture of an honored person. This one may be Sumac's visage.

949
03:42:16,379 --> 03:42:20,139
Avi, big guy and I are at the floor of the cave.

950
03:42:21,260 --> 03:42:27,799
What do you see? There's a mechanism in the ground. Looks about the same size as the head.

951
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:35,000
It's a giant lock, Rico. The wuma is the key. Can you use the retract to get the wuma to the mechanism?

952
03:42:36,360 --> 03:42:45,739
Why not? I'll try.

953
03:42:49,340 --> 03:42:53,610
Rico, use the retract motor to get the wuma to the lock.

954
03:42:54,569 --> 03:43:08,680
I'll get it. It'll get in there. Perfectly fine. Just small injuries.

955
03:43:11,879 --> 03:43:14,020
That hit me right in the fucking head, too.

956
03:43:24,500 --> 03:43:28,100
Fine, I'll do it the dumb way. I'll do it the way that you want me to do it,

957
03:43:28,100 --> 03:43:40,010
video game. Come on over here. Get in there.

958
03:43:40,889 --> 03:43:46,819
If something happened, a door opened up. This is a Nickelodeon game show.

959
03:43:47,379 --> 03:43:51,370
Where Sumac sleeps eternal. Rico, please.

960
03:43:59,420 --> 03:44:06,700
Where he sleeps eternal. There's a human skull with a candle inside. Light it and be ready for anything.

961
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:16,379
There's text on the wall. What the fuck happened? I'm buried. Only five beds remain.

962
03:44:17,340 --> 03:44:20,780
That mean anything to you? Get this thing open.

963
03:44:21,260 --> 03:44:29,340
It sounds like a single line from a longer text. Get it open. If it's gonna screw over Espanosa, count me in.

964
03:44:30,700 --> 03:44:36,459
Bueno, others close to Otorongo will likely have the other lines. The tombs of his family, his advisors.

965
03:44:37,260 --> 03:44:43,299
I'll keep my eyes open. Help him uncover the truth.

966
03:44:44,100 --> 03:44:50,739
Seek out the hidden tombs of Otorongo's family and advisors helping him, and associates will earn you mod points.

967
03:44:51,219 --> 03:45:07,989
That's good. Everyone thought I was stuck. Sorry, I'm not stuck. I'm absolutely fine, but

968
03:45:08,870 --> 03:45:11,590
you don't think I'm gonna take this thing for a balloon ride. You're out of your mind.

969
03:45:20,809 --> 03:45:33,219
I'd say we probably make sure it's balanced, otherwise this whole thing's gonna start turning around.

970
03:45:34,309 --> 03:45:40,729
I need to just make a circle.

971
03:45:46,389 --> 03:45:48,389
Fire it up with a slingshot.

972
03:45:50,149 --> 03:45:52,149
How many D's can I have? Ten? It's ten maximum.

973
03:45:54,549 --> 03:46:03,819
Away we go. My goodness.

974
03:46:15,500 --> 03:46:28,940
I can't. It's not gonna go. Put boosters underneath it.

975
03:46:32,069 --> 03:46:40,219
I mean, it's gonna fly all over the place, but I'll try it. Can I move it with my hands? No.

976
03:46:42,299 --> 03:46:45,100
All right, so here's what's gonna have to happen. I'm gonna put- let's get up there.

977
03:46:47,370 --> 03:46:49,530
Let's put balloons. Stay up there, dude.

978
03:46:53,290 --> 03:46:55,290
Okay, let's balloon it to get it off the ground.

979
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:02,180
And then once it's off the ground,

980
03:47:03,620 --> 03:47:05,620
we'll put the crusters underneath.

981
03:47:05,860 --> 03:47:09,620
Okay.

982
03:47:09,620 --> 03:47:11,620
Crusters are A.

983
03:47:13,579 --> 03:47:15,500
Don't hit me, please.

984
03:47:15,500 --> 03:47:19,420
God, this is- this is gonna be hard to do this without getting crushed.

985
03:47:27,299 --> 03:47:44,709
It's reaching the height limit. With these on it, it would- it definitely will not. It'll go flying through fucking air.

986
03:47:45,510 --> 03:47:47,750
What am I doing? Hold on to my spine.

987
03:47:54,940 --> 03:47:59,670
What? I don't get it. What the hell?

988
03:48:00,149 --> 03:48:12,809
Is it not on anymore?

989
03:48:12,889 --> 03:48:20,790
Hold on. Was it- the wrong fucking thing was on. God damn it, really. I thought it was A.

990
03:48:35,989 --> 03:48:39,829
Let's go.

991
03:48:47,379 --> 03:48:51,879
All right, here we go.

992
03:48:56,549 --> 03:48:59,829
Change the height limit? Change height limit?

993
03:49:02,280 --> 03:49:04,520
Does it have- is it on the balloons?

994
03:49:05,159 --> 03:49:10,100
Yeah, but I mean, I have to- I have these things on right now. Shouldn't that not even matter anymore?

995
03:49:14,500 --> 03:49:17,219
Air height limit.

996
03:49:17,219 --> 03:49:18,579
Air lifter.

997
03:49:18,579 --> 03:49:20,180
I mean, it's-

998
03:49:20,180 --> 03:49:26,579
Where do I do that? This is the tractor.

999
03:49:30,100 --> 03:49:33,459
Loadout B controlled. How the fuck do I edit mods, right? Okay.

1000
03:49:34,649 --> 03:49:36,649
Peak altitude is at medium.

1001
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:45,139
No limit. Okay.

1002
03:49:47,510 --> 03:49:50,069
So then I should just get on top of it then.

1003
03:50:01,030 --> 03:50:04,090
No, fuck. I just got hit by the ball.

1004
03:50:08,860 --> 03:50:13,209
Whoa.

1005
03:50:13,209 --> 03:50:21,260
All right, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. Let's just try to do it with balloons now.

1006
03:50:23,059 --> 03:50:25,540
Because if the height limit is off, then maybe I can just fly out.

1007
03:50:29,459 --> 03:50:41,540
Right? Wouldn't that make sense? Oh fuck. Jesus, I don't know it's gonna happen this quickly. Fuck.

1008
03:50:44,709 --> 03:50:54,920
Oh, no!

1009
03:50:54,920 --> 03:50:57,079
How high went so high so quickly?

1010
03:50:59,579 --> 03:51:01,420
All right, where is it?

1011
03:51:01,420 --> 03:51:10,139
Where's the ball? Okay, I deleted all the- there it comes. Okay.

1012
03:51:14,889 --> 03:51:18,729
Am I- am I out of the way? I don't know if I'm in the way or not. Nope. I'm good.

1013
03:51:22,139 --> 03:51:24,139
It's a fucking asteroid.

1014
03:51:24,459 --> 03:51:27,020
All right, let's

1015
03:51:27,020 --> 03:51:30,700
settle down, settle down. I didn't know it was gonna happen that quickly. I gotta do it in the right place.

1016
03:51:31,340 --> 03:51:38,569
Gonna find like the center of the ball. This is fine right here.

1017
03:51:39,209 --> 03:51:42,219
Right in the nose.

1018
03:51:46,649 --> 03:51:51,750
Okay, now wait a second before I do anything else. Oh no, right here.

1019
03:51:53,110 --> 03:52:16,120
Oh shit.

1020
03:52:16,120 --> 03:52:19,750
What?

1021
03:52:19,750 --> 03:52:21,590
We're still going up.

1022
03:52:21,590 --> 03:52:33,940
We're still going through the clouds. I don't think we've even started a descent. I don't think there is a descent.

1023
03:52:35,430 --> 03:52:37,430
No, yes, there is. Oh fuck, it's descending.

1024
03:52:37,909 --> 03:52:40,649
It's going fast. Ah, I got another balloon. Another balloon?

1025
03:52:45,139 --> 03:52:47,139
We're going really fast.

1026
03:52:48,899 --> 03:52:51,780
I don't- we're going so fast. I can't even fucking do anything.

1027
03:52:52,819 --> 03:52:54,020
Whoa!

1028
03:52:54,020 --> 03:52:59,020
What?

1029
03:52:59,020 --> 03:53:01,340
That just went a thousand miles per hour.

1030
03:53:04,059 --> 03:53:12,540
Oh my god.

1031
03:53:12,540 --> 03:53:14,620
That speed was just increasing the whole time.

1032
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:26,780
Where is it though? Let me see it. Is it- did it fall back down?

1033
03:53:27,659 --> 03:53:39,670
No, it's gone. Did it land in the jungle? Fuck, really?

1034
03:53:50,120 --> 03:53:52,420
I don't see it anywhere. It's gone.

1035
03:53:53,059 --> 03:53:58,229
Oh well, that was fun.

1036
03:53:59,110 --> 03:54:03,270
That thing did not have a terminal velocity. It just kept going faster and faster. It's in the hole.

1037
03:54:05,139 --> 03:54:06,340
No, it's not.

1038
03:54:06,340 --> 03:54:22,549
That's not- that's not it.

1039
03:54:22,549 --> 03:54:26,379
It's not in the hole.

1040
03:54:26,379 --> 03:54:28,940
Really? I went all the fucking way back down here.

1041
03:54:47,879 --> 03:54:56,360
What the fuck? Where did you guys even come from? Why did a fucking hundred animals just spawn?

1042
03:54:59,700 --> 03:55:02,100
What are you people doing? What are you doing?

1043
03:55:14,760 --> 03:55:21,979
Save him. Oh shit, save- I can save him. You're right. Hold on. I can save him. Where's the balloon? All right, save.

1044
03:55:26,739 --> 03:55:31,159
Are you telling me the water is too strong for this?

1045
03:55:35,319 --> 03:55:39,399
What's it gonna take to pull you out of here, man? Why are you connected to the-

1046
03:55:41,639 --> 03:55:43,639
Get him out! Get him out!

1047
03:55:58,520 --> 03:56:00,520
Hold on, is he gonna fall back down?

1048
03:56:06,739 --> 03:56:08,979
The theory would be he would be falling back down, right?

1049
03:56:32,459 --> 03:56:35,500
Okay, I'm fucking being a psycho. I gotta get out of this cave.

1050
03:56:36,219 --> 03:56:44,600
Like, what the fuck am I doing?

1051
03:56:50,360 --> 03:57:04,520
What the hell do I even have to do now? Okay, we've got a helicopter stunt.

1052
03:57:06,120 --> 03:57:13,540
Speed stunt. Find the rock or riot. All right, hold on. Let me do this first.

1053
03:57:23,899 --> 03:57:59,030
This is gonna be un-fucking-bearable, you guys understand that, right? I can't even fit it on here.

1054
03:58:02,149 --> 03:58:21,670
Oh my fucking god, it really looks like a Nintendo 64 game. Well, I need to change- hold on, I gotta change the title.

1055
03:58:22,389 --> 03:58:31,209
I gotta change the title to, like,

1056
03:58:31,770 --> 03:58:34,840
Just Cause 4.

1057
03:58:37,799 --> 03:58:43,180
Just Cause 4.

1058
03:58:45,040 --> 03:58:47,540
3DS.

1059
03:58:48,200 --> 03:58:52,489
3DS.

1060
03:58:55,610 --> 03:59:00,170
This is a lie, though. How long can I keep this up? But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1061
03:59:01,979 --> 03:59:10,950
We're gonna take this a little bit further. Hold on. I'm gonna put a- I'm gonna put a 3DS on the screen.

1062
03:59:11,350 --> 03:59:32,229
Okay, I need just, like, a nice open 3DS image. All right, that looks pretty good. Yeah, this one looks pretty good.

1063
03:59:32,790 --> 03:59:36,520
See if we can get it on there. Yeah, okay.

1064
03:59:40,260 --> 03:59:41,700
Save image.

1065
03:59:41,700 --> 03:59:49,690
Okay.

1066
03:59:49,690 --> 03:59:51,129
Did it work?

1067
03:59:51,129 --> 03:59:58,420
Can you see it?

1068
03:59:58,579 --> 04:00:04,860
Okay.

1069
04:00:04,860 --> 04:00:31,670
Just give me a moment.

1070
04:00:31,670 --> 04:00:33,909
It needs to be a little bit bigger. It needs to be a little bigger.

1071
04:00:38,100 --> 04:00:41,299
You know what I mean? Like, I can't just be that. Like, anyway, like, that's a little bit better.

1072
04:00:58,120 --> 04:01:01,479
All right, that looks pretty good. Maybe a little bit lower to get the edge there.

1073
04:01:17,860 --> 04:01:33,979
Facecam on the bottom. I don't have my facecam plugged in. Do it. I- I can't.

1074
04:01:35,739 --> 04:01:37,739
No, we need, like, a picture of Super Mario.

1075
04:01:38,139 --> 04:01:44,540
Man, this actually feels really good on the 3DS. Something I was, uh,

1076
04:01:45,180 --> 04:01:46,860
kind of shocked to see.

1077
04:01:46,860 --> 04:01:52,540
You know, I've been in games journalism for a long time, but man, the 3DS version, this does hold up.

1078
04:01:53,500 --> 04:01:55,979
This is a clean, uh, 60 fps.

1079
04:01:56,700 --> 04:02:09,239
Put a one minute delayed video of Just Cause on the bottom.

1080
04:02:10,889 --> 04:02:13,530
No, no, no, no. Guys, what are you- what are you talking about here? Hold on.

1081
04:02:14,329 --> 04:02:18,010
Why you just- excuse me. If this was- if this was not a fucking bullshit joke.

1082
04:02:19,899 --> 04:02:21,420
Print screen, please.

1083
04:02:21,420 --> 04:02:32,010
This is- the map is down there. If you- if this is gonna be legitimate, I mean, it's gotta be legitimate then.

1084
04:02:32,489 --> 04:02:46,010
Okay, let me just open up paint.

1085
04:02:46,010 --> 04:02:46,969
All right.

1086
04:02:46,969 --> 04:02:53,049
Too bad. I can't just, like, record.

1087
04:02:55,420 --> 04:03:02,170
Me. No, that's gonna- that would take so long. Okay, save as PNG. That looks fine.

1088
04:03:08,600 --> 04:03:21,379
We're gonna have to shrink this a little more. Okay, how does that look?

1089
04:03:29,500 --> 04:03:52,170
It's a little skewed. It's because this is tilted, so it doesn't fit that well. I need to angle it. I can't.

1090
04:04:00,149 --> 04:04:03,180
Tilt it in paint?

1091
04:04:03,180 --> 04:04:08,579
You- I can tilt that in paint. What? How the fuck do you do that?

1092
04:04:19,209 --> 04:04:21,610
Free transform it into a trapezoid.

1093
04:04:27,899 --> 04:04:32,040
The skew tool?

1094
04:04:32,040 --> 04:04:44,280
Skew? I see rotate, resize, crop, resize.

1095
04:04:44,979 --> 04:04:48,100
Skew? What?

1096
04:04:48,120 --> 04:05:07,209
Skew it- how many degrees? Like 10? No, minus five. Vertical? We should go vertical, right? So we need a

1097
04:05:08,010 --> 04:05:18,629
vertical skew of, like, five. That kind of fucks it all up, though. What about this at five?

1098
04:05:18,950 --> 04:05:25,659
No, that's kind of fucked up looking.

1099
04:05:29,479 --> 04:05:43,879
Uh, no, that doesn't work. Can I skew an OBS? Let's see. I don't think I can.

1100
04:05:44,440 --> 04:06:00,120
Maybe filter?

1101
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:08,950
No. No, that's just the way it is. Just gonna have to be like this. Just use the 2DS.

1102
04:06:09,190 --> 04:06:25,620
Oops-a-daisy. Well, it's just gonna have to be like this. Shift and grab. No, shift grab just does that. It's all right.

1103
04:06:26,020 --> 04:06:52,780
Close enough. Wait, oh, I need hands, too, though. What the fuck? Okay, hold on. Save image.

1104
04:06:55,110 --> 04:06:57,850
Hand.

1105
04:06:57,850 --> 04:07:00,409
Run the desktop. That's fine. Okay, hold on.

1106
04:07:01,129 --> 04:07:04,969
Oh fuck, it's not keyed out, though. No, it's not gonna work. Never mind.

1107
04:07:12,459 --> 04:07:14,459
Never mind. It's too much.

1108
04:07:17,530 --> 04:07:27,719
What did I just do? Oh, did I just delete it? Did I just, like, exit the game?

1109
04:07:37,219 --> 04:07:40,420
Uh, this is very hard to play this, but let's play. Here we go.

1110
04:07:44,329 --> 04:08:02,549
Holy fuck, I actually got it. He play looking at OBS? No, I'm playing on the big screen that looks like

1111
04:08:04,170 --> 04:08:06,809
it's this so much aliasing. It's unbelievable.

1112
04:08:07,530 --> 04:08:18,819
Now, let's go do a mission. Is it so hard to point this? I don't even know what the cursor is.

1113
04:08:37,129 --> 04:08:43,909
Watch it. 160p for the authentic experience. I need to pick a mission.

1114
04:08:46,409 --> 04:08:48,889
Uh, here's one. I can't read that.

1115
04:08:49,850 --> 04:08:51,850
Let me try as hard as I can.

1116
04:08:51,930 --> 04:08:58,090
Agency distress beacon. An agency distress signal has pinged

1117
04:08:58,729 --> 04:09:01,610
who grappling hook over since

1118
04:09:02,409 --> 04:09:05,139
the

1119
04:09:05,139 --> 04:09:06,920
stufafone at

1120
04:09:06,920 --> 04:09:08,780
Ilapa

1121
04:09:08,780 --> 04:09:11,590
That can't be

1122
04:09:11,889 --> 04:09:13,110
evidence

1123
04:09:13,110 --> 04:09:15,299
loves

1124
04:09:15,299 --> 04:09:17,860
When the source of the beacon

1125
04:09:18,579 --> 04:09:28,729
All right, you got it. Why am I? What happened to my momentum? Oh

1126
04:09:29,899 --> 04:09:33,340
Where's my fucking momentum? Whatever

1127
04:09:36,489 --> 04:09:44,629
Okay, that was odd. Can I get on your car or is it not gonna let me do this?

1128
04:09:46,469 --> 04:09:50,790
Right, okay that you know, sure i'll take this one that sounds like a fun place that sounds good

1129
04:09:51,590 --> 04:09:55,430
Like the real the 3ds port really is like just a little too buggy for me. I think

1130
04:09:56,149 --> 04:10:13,579
Gotta go this way

1131
04:10:13,579 --> 04:10:15,579
Turn on music

1132
04:10:18,620 --> 04:10:26,500
The game honestly looks better like this, uh, I'm gonna I'm gonna send a disagree here

1133
04:10:31,510 --> 04:10:46,389
That's not authentic though. Hold on. Give me one more second because that's not authentic. It's about to be though

1134
04:10:47,909 --> 04:10:53,319
Okay, um

1135
04:10:53,319 --> 04:10:55,940
We need

1136
04:10:55,940 --> 04:11:03,110
one of these

1137
04:11:03,350 --> 04:11:19,190
Hold on a second. Let's see how that sounds

1138
04:11:20,889 --> 04:11:23,290
Another a little bit here. Hold on

1139
04:11:26,020 --> 04:11:27,750
Okay

1140
04:11:27,750 --> 04:11:29,750
Tell me how that changes things

1141
04:11:29,829 --> 04:12:05,270
Wow

1142
04:12:05,270 --> 04:12:11,690
Go worse. I need I need to know what that sounds like man. Hold on. What did that sound like?

1143
04:12:14,629 --> 04:12:21,879
See how that sounds. I'm not gonna put this loud. I just need to know what it sounded like

1144
04:12:22,440 --> 04:12:34,459
Okay

1145
04:12:35,180 --> 04:12:36,860
It was just

1146
04:12:36,860 --> 04:12:38,860
It didn't change anything

1147
04:12:39,940 --> 04:12:41,940
It didn't change fucking anything. It just made it

1148
04:12:42,959 --> 04:12:55,959
Extremely loud. Hold on. That's why

1149
04:13:03,940 --> 04:13:14,299
Okay, let's see what that does. Is that different? Does that sound different?

1150
04:13:24,680 --> 04:13:30,500
The link what do you mean the link? What do you want for the link? What are you guys linking me?

1151
04:13:34,309 --> 04:13:37,110
Somebody just did it somebody made it

1152
04:13:39,510 --> 04:13:41,510
Why

1153
04:13:44,309 --> 04:13:49,299
Uh

1154
04:13:50,260 --> 04:14:01,030
Well, hold on

1155
04:14:01,030 --> 04:14:04,309
All right. Well, let's get rid of everything else but this

1156
04:14:21,030 --> 04:14:22,780
Oh my god

1157
04:14:22,780 --> 04:14:25,020
How's that a little bit more down?

1158
04:14:29,610 --> 04:14:35,049
That looks pretty good. Maybe a little bit up and to the right

1159
04:14:41,690 --> 04:14:47,159
How does this sound?

1160
04:14:47,159 --> 04:14:51,000
Cap it to 30 frames a second. Oh my god. I don't think I can

1161
04:14:53,209 --> 04:15:01,079
I don't think I can do that

1162
04:15:01,079 --> 04:15:05,430
Scale resolution. Hold on. I don't think I can do that

1163
04:15:06,069 --> 04:15:10,010
filters

1164
04:15:10,010 --> 04:15:18,100
Scaling aspect ratio. I can do it in obs but i'm gonna have to turn the stream off

1165
04:15:19,420 --> 04:15:28,409
Set my monitor's refresh rate to 30 do it in the game

1166
04:15:29,850 --> 04:15:34,780
Do it turn i'm not gonna turn the bit rate down on the stream

1167
04:15:39,540 --> 04:15:41,540
No, let me just wait

1168
04:15:55,500 --> 04:15:59,260
I think you seriously underestimate how I how much I cannot see what's going on on the screen

1169
04:16:07,559 --> 04:16:10,680
Now if this is authentic though, I have to play a little differently. You know what i'm saying?

1170
04:16:21,450 --> 04:16:23,450
Oh fucking jesus. Let me do this

1171
04:16:29,780 --> 04:16:31,780
Oh my god

1172
04:16:32,870 --> 04:17:11,219
Fuck this i'm out of here. I have to use the actual controller. I don't know the controls

1173
04:17:12,040 --> 04:17:20,659
What are the controls? Oh use tilt controls

1174
04:17:22,680 --> 04:17:29,000
One of the crazy things about this is uh that i'm what is that? Oh, I don't have any more bullets

1175
04:17:37,059 --> 04:17:43,079
All right. I figured out how to use the uh, okay hold

1176
04:17:43,639 --> 04:17:49,620
Hold what I can't even see what that says left trigger. I don't know what that even says right trigger

1177
04:17:49,940 --> 04:17:56,819
How's the battery battery low?

1178
04:18:29,879 --> 04:18:50,520
Really, come on. I thought it was already keyed out. It that they already had the channel gone. Whatever keep it

1179
04:18:50,600 --> 04:18:56,020
No, it has to be authentic. All right

1180
04:18:56,100 --> 04:18:58,979
I don't know how much more longer I can take this before my eyes actually start to hurt

1181
04:18:59,139 --> 04:19:23,930
All right, I'm gonna go back to the the controls. I know how to use okay comes the end of the joke voice

1182
04:19:24,329 --> 04:19:37,049
I'll do something at back before though. I promise i'm gonna do something fucking epic read chat

1183
04:19:37,770 --> 04:19:41,850
No, I

1184
04:19:41,850 --> 04:19:49,989
Another link chats going too fast. I can't click. What is this?

1185
04:19:52,219 --> 04:19:54,459
Is this supposed to be in my office?

1186
04:19:56,200 --> 04:20:02,420
This is my office. How many more layers is gonna are we gonna add to this?

1187
04:20:27,700 --> 04:20:49,260
No, I'm like so done with this. No, I'm not gonna put hands on you get the idea you get the you get the idea

1188
04:21:05,139 --> 04:21:12,309
Hands is too much. Oh, I just bounced off the ground. That was lucky

1189
04:21:14,309 --> 04:21:18,069
No

1190
04:21:18,069 --> 04:21:25,739
Take a picture of your desk have to make the screen dirty

1191
04:21:29,299 --> 04:21:36,500
I like that idea. All right, i'm gonna get like a transparency of like dirty screen dirty dirty window a dirty screen

1192
04:21:36,979 --> 04:21:51,620
Does it add like smears on it? All right, I think I can do I can work with this

1193
04:21:53,829 --> 04:22:05,739
Add a crack in it too. It's gonna be broken. Oh, here we go. This is perfect

1194
04:22:07,930 --> 04:22:14,420
But how am I I gotta i'm gonna have to do like transparency with this. Let me see if I can get this to work

1195
04:22:14,979 --> 04:22:21,159
Okay, did that work? Let's see if I can get this screen dirty

1196
04:22:34,520 --> 04:22:38,739
Hold on. I didn't need to

1197
04:22:41,059 --> 04:22:43,690
I need to turn the opacity down

1198
04:22:50,889 --> 04:22:58,040
Opacity

1202
04:23:45,819 --> 04:23:51,690
Um

It's so dirty

1204
04:23:59,700 --> 04:24:16,579
It's really really too dirty. I think is that too dirty capacity is at like 75

1205
04:24:21,370 --> 04:24:30,219
That's like fucking puke man. That's that is so dirty. Somebody just dropped it in the mud and put a reflection of my face

1206
04:24:30,860 --> 04:24:32,860
Oh for the love of god

1207
04:24:39,879 --> 04:24:56,260
All right. Give me a second. This is worth it. It's gonna stay on too. Hold on

1208
04:24:56,340 --> 04:25:00,950
I need to make sure this is gonna reach no, it's okay. This will work

1209
04:25:10,219 --> 04:25:17,290
It needs to be pointed in the right spot tilted like I may be looking right down at it though

1210
04:25:20,379 --> 04:25:22,360
Okay, hold on

1211
04:25:22,360 --> 04:25:24,360
I gotta add that as a source now

1212
04:25:37,770 --> 04:26:25,959
Okay, this will be worth it when it's done right like right here. Okay. Okay

1218
04:29:31,290 --> 04:29:34,489

04:29:36,469 --> 04:30:06,340
All right, we got hands god damn it this is fucking so stupid I love it

Okay, hold on. I need to do this

1222
04:30:35,959 --> 04:30:37,479
That's so dirty

1223
04:30:37,479 --> 04:30:39,479
Is that really what we were using?

1224
04:30:42,489 --> 04:30:45,500
That's disgusting

1225
04:30:45,500 --> 04:30:52,969
Okay, that's this one. Where is the dirt coming from right here, right? No, that's this one. There's the dirt

1226
04:30:53,049 --> 04:30:55,430

Where's this image? Wait, what the fuck is going on? Why is it doing this? This should be at the top

1230
04:31:28,709 --> 04:31:38,170
You know, it's because it's keying it out. Hold on. Hold on less dirt. No, we need like all the dirt we can get

1231
04:31:38,569 --> 04:31:45,430
So this one can go it's because it's keying out the background. So hold on. What is this one?

1232
04:31:45,909 --> 04:31:48,709
That's the fucking battery now. I'm getting rid of that

1233
04:31:50,649 --> 04:31:52,709
Here's this

1234
04:31:52,709 --> 04:31:54,709
This is another one that can be removed

1235
04:31:57,110 --> 04:32:02,950
This is I don't even know what the fuck is down here. We're almost close to perfect

1236
04:32:07,319 --> 04:32:09,319
Okay, here's the game

1237
04:32:09,799 --> 04:32:14,840
Why is the game not being captured anymore? Okay. There we go. All right nice and

1238

Nice and dirty

1239

Where's that dirt? There it is

1240
04:32:23,690 --> 04:32:36,600
How's that? It's off center

1241
04:32:36,920 --> 04:32:38,969
I can fix that

1242
04:32:38,969 --> 04:32:48,329
So I need to go here and here

1243
04:32:51,030 --> 04:32:54,659
The game needs to go

1244
04:32:54,659 --> 04:32:56,659
See what we got here

1245
04:32:56,739 --> 04:33:05,509
Okay. Now what is down there though? I need to full screen this

1246
04:33:06,069 --> 04:33:17,110
Am I like eyes deceiving me? No, okay. It's fine

1247
04:33:23,029 --> 04:33:29,700
Move dirt move dirt move the dirt. No dirt's good. No, we're good. That's it. We're ready to go

1248
04:33:30,099 --> 04:33:52,790
Okay. Now I gotta make sure you can see my face, right? Okay. Here we go right here put dirt on your hands, too

1272
04:40:02,330 --> 04:40:05,450
All right, i'm fucking done. Like I played just cause

1273
04:40:07,729 --> 04:40:11,139
Sneezing cracks

1274
04:40:11,220 --> 04:40:16,040
I sneezed so badly that it cracked my 3ds

1275
04:40:17,319 --> 04:40:28,439
Really?

1276
04:40:28,439 --> 04:40:44,020
Hold on. No, I can't like I can't like punch it and like I guess I can what the fuck man

1277
04:40:52,090 --> 04:41:08,360
I can't control it dude. This game sucks. This game sucks. Okay, let's get crack 3ds voice

1278
04:41:25,659 --> 04:41:33,270
Mom

1279
04:41:33,270 --> 04:41:53,900
Mom mom, do you know what my charger is? I have one percent battery

1280
04:41:56,889 --> 04:41:58,090
Uh

1281
04:41:58,090 --> 04:42:01,740
This game sucks

1282
04:42:20,380 --> 04:42:21,419
3d

1283
04:42:21,419 --> 04:42:32,250
All right. I'm out. That was fun. I'm done with this. It's impossible. I can't play like this

1284
04:42:42,919 --> 04:42:52,869
My 3ds is off. My 3ds is broken though. Sorry guys. It's the webcam mic. It shouldn't be

1285
04:42:57,319 --> 04:43:01,639
Yes for you. Heard you broke. I also brought the charger for you. Thanks mom

1286
04:43:02,200 --> 04:43:04,200
Son take better care

1287
04:43:04,439 --> 04:43:07,180
Can I have your 3ds, please? I'm sorry

1288
04:43:08,139 --> 04:43:29,110
Broke my 3ds

1289
04:43:29,189 --> 04:43:45,740
Two 3ds's are you serious? What's in there? Oh my god

1290
04:43:46,619 --> 04:44:08,229
It's just cause it's too far. There's like four 3ds's in this house. How do I go back to normal?

1291
04:44:08,919 --> 04:44:17,880
Is it even possible takes the resolution so you can play but please keep the 3ds overlay

1292
04:44:18,119 --> 04:44:22,439
Why do you want the 3ds overlay? It's the it's impossible to watch

1293
04:44:33,669 --> 04:44:36,229
It's just a lie. It's not even real

1294
04:44:37,819 --> 04:44:40,310
Hold on. I let

1295
04:44:40,310 --> 04:44:43,189
The dirt on the screen. Let me at least be able to see what i'm doing

1296
04:44:53,020 --> 04:44:55,020
Wait, we're on the webcam

1297
04:44:55,819 --> 04:45:01,060
Why are we on the webcam mic? That's not the webcam

1298
04:45:01,619 --> 04:45:05,770
Oh, you want to be on the webcam mic. I see what you're saying

1299
04:45:06,650 --> 04:45:15,479
I get it

1300
04:45:25,720 --> 04:45:29,259
Okay, i'm a secret agent

1301
04:45:29,979 --> 04:45:47,759
Oh

1302
04:45:51,159 --> 04:45:53,319
This game's actually really really good though

1303
04:45:55,560 --> 04:45:59,819
It's got mostly negative on steam. I don't I don't know

1304
04:46:00,799 --> 04:46:10,520
Maybe it's because it's not on 3ds like this is I mean, that's probably why

1305
04:46:11,770 --> 04:46:13,770
Because it's not in the 3ds

1306
04:46:21,659 --> 04:46:27,150
keyboard

1307
04:46:27,150 --> 04:46:29,069
And that and that's it

1308
04:46:29,069 --> 04:46:36,720
And that's it

1309
04:46:36,720 --> 04:46:40,479
Immersion is we're done. We're done with this. That was a lot of fun

1310
04:46:43,500 --> 04:46:45,819
Now i'm gonna go back to playing just cause 4

1311
04:46:47,689 --> 04:46:52,889
I mean, we how this has been like a fucking hour. We've been doing this for an hour

1312
04:47:02,970 --> 04:47:04,970
No, i'm not turning the stream off

1313
04:47:09,560 --> 04:47:11,799
Don't let the photoshop go to waste

1314
04:47:17,130 --> 04:47:22,090
Some guy gave hands to you and you're whose hands are those though? I don't know whose those are

1315
04:47:28,720 --> 04:47:30,159
What happened?

1316
04:47:30,159 --> 04:47:34,060
Why did that happen?

1317
04:47:34,060 --> 04:47:36,060
They're yours

1318
04:47:40,590 --> 04:47:49,720
All right, I need to go back to normal that was fucking that was a lot of fun

1319
04:47:50,200 --> 04:47:53,340
But I need to put this back into 1080

1320
04:47:55,360 --> 04:47:56,479
before I

1321
04:47:56,479 --> 04:48:03,040
Literally lose my mind

1322
04:48:03,040 --> 04:48:06,159
So tomorrow we're gonna be streaming the game awards if you didn't know

1323
04:48:06,720 --> 04:48:18,490
Should be fun. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving. Why does everybody think i'm leaving?

1324
04:48:19,799 --> 04:48:27,470
I can't say well, okay, but until people just think i'm gonna leave the stream. Well, that doesn't look right

1325
04:48:28,029 --> 04:48:32,330
This looks completely wrong

1326
04:48:32,330 --> 04:48:35,130
Okay, well, let's try maybe this will fix it

1327
04:48:35,849 --> 04:48:40,540
Hey, look at that. Wow. This feels very strange

1328
04:48:41,099 --> 04:48:43,099
This is this feels incorrect

1329
04:48:44,299 --> 04:48:56,599
I really feel like this feels wrong. Okay. Yeah game awards are gonna be streaming it. We're gonna. Oh, we're gonna talk about it

1330
04:48:58,060 --> 04:49:00,060
All right, let me give me this car

1331
04:49:00,139 --> 04:49:10,939
Actually, I want a bike. Well, I missed the bike like an idiot

1332
04:49:14,560 --> 04:49:16,880
All right, how far away is that start agency district?

1333
04:49:20,779 --> 04:49:23,740
What the fuck? Why is there a tank here?

1334
04:49:26,959 --> 04:49:32,729
Why am I still alive?

1335
04:49:32,729 --> 04:49:34,810
Who's playing a fucking rts right now?

1336
04:49:38,880 --> 04:49:47,259
Do they think that's me? I guess still alive. He's still trying to drive the car

1337
04:49:53,500 --> 04:49:54,459
Okay

1338
04:49:54,459 --> 04:49:56,459
Well, not anymore. It seems

1339
04:50:01,150 --> 04:50:03,150
Oh my god with the cycles

1340
04:50:07,599 --> 04:50:09,599
Destroy the bridge. Okay. Fine. Watch this

1341
04:50:10,840 --> 04:50:14,720
You can you can do that. You actually can I thought you kidding

1342
04:50:20,540 --> 04:50:33,069
Okay, I gotta get down there this way. How far away is this place?

1343
04:50:33,869 --> 04:50:42,909
Actually, not that far you can get there a little lickety split. All right, let me try not to

1344
04:50:43,900 --> 04:50:48,990
I said that and I almost did it

1345
04:50:48,990 --> 04:50:51,950
I'm so used to playing this on the 3ds that I forget how to play control the game

1346
04:51:09,790 --> 04:51:12,750
No, we're pretty far away. I can I like a guy can get some speed here

1347
04:51:15,080 --> 04:51:17,520
There we go. I finally figured it out

1348
04:51:21,919 --> 04:51:23,919
Now i'm moving fast now i'll move it fast

1349
04:51:28,720 --> 04:51:30,720
Yeah

1350
04:51:34,250 --> 04:51:36,009
Yeah

1351
04:51:36,009 --> 04:51:44,880
Yeah

1352
04:51:44,880 --> 04:51:46,880
Very fast. Hooray

1353
04:51:50,139 --> 04:51:53,500
You just it's transitioning between the two of them that makes it easier like that

1354
04:52:09,209 --> 04:52:12,330
What what do you get why is everybody making the I made this face

1355
04:52:16,200 --> 04:52:19,319
Everything I love this stream. Why is I made this?

1356
04:52:22,939 --> 04:52:24,939
Oh for the love of god, okay

1357
04:52:35,119 --> 04:52:46,189
Well, that was uh, okay that looks a little better right? Yeah. Okay. We're fine. Hey, hi i'm back

1358
04:52:51,979 --> 04:52:59,080
How long that must have been on there the whole time. It's all right. Did I go buy it? No, it's right here

1359
04:53:02,380 --> 04:53:06,299
Go back to the webcam the mic the webcam mic is not still on

1360
04:53:06,700 --> 04:53:24,650
I just want to get up to the top of the mountain. Oh the game audio too. Fuck

1361
04:53:26,270 --> 04:53:30,270
I forgot there's a shit little filters on this. There's so many the game

1362
04:53:30,750 --> 04:53:33,310
Okay now you should it shouldn't be insane

1363
04:53:39,000 --> 04:53:50,970
What a terrible fucking stream that would have been webcam mic and a bunch of filters on the audio stream is now ruined

1364
04:53:51,209 --> 04:53:56,279
And

1365
04:53:56,279 --> 04:54:03,450
Why would you do something like that? Thank god. I didn't kick the goat in the head

1366
04:54:04,799 --> 04:54:07,200
Okay, we're gonna do a mission. Hey, would you look at that?

1367
04:54:07,840 --> 04:54:11,740
Hey look a mission guys

1368
04:54:11,740 --> 04:54:19,720
Can you believe it?

1369
04:54:19,720 --> 04:54:22,509
Tom sheldon

1370
04:54:22,509 --> 04:54:24,909
Well, I guess you got my message. Yeah

1371
04:54:25,549 --> 04:54:29,759
He's all cleared me up. I'm on my way. Who's that?

1372
04:54:31,790 --> 04:54:33,790
Why are you here sheldon?

1373
04:54:33,790 --> 04:54:39,470
When you went dark after medici, I figured i'd look through some of your old files see where you might end up

1374
04:54:40,430 --> 04:54:46,509
It turns out your dad is working with us. He has a really really great something called project

1375
04:54:50,349 --> 04:54:52,349
That's like tinsel

1376
04:54:54,430 --> 04:54:56,430
Talk of weather modification technology

1377
04:54:59,310 --> 04:55:05,549
Did I turn the graphics back right looking at those eopah files I ended up on administrative leave

1378
04:55:07,319 --> 04:55:10,279
I guess i'm not the only one who doesn't trust tom sheldon

1379
04:55:10,840 --> 04:55:13,400
Maybe I didn't know you're looking to take out eopah rico

1380
04:55:14,119 --> 04:55:16,439
I've already done some of the legwork fake snow

1381
04:55:17,950 --> 04:55:19,950
You screwed me over more than once in medici

1382
04:55:20,970 --> 04:55:25,689
I don't want your help sheldon. Well, you're gonna need man. This looks much better on the 3ds. I agree

1383
04:55:28,560 --> 04:55:32,400
Turns out that place is constantly surrounded by a nasty lightning storm

1384
04:55:33,360 --> 04:55:35,360
Uh fried poor annabelle here

1385
04:55:36,080 --> 04:55:41,310
That seems pretty suspicious to have a standing lightning storm like that. Don't you think?

1386
04:55:45,419 --> 04:55:47,419
Is a friend of yours rico?

1387
04:55:47,819 --> 04:55:49,520
Not exactly

1388
04:55:49,520 --> 04:55:55,439
Nira malales, she's tom sheldon. I'm sorry for the mouth. There's nothing I can do about it. He cannot be trusted

1389
04:55:56,680 --> 04:56:01,000
Buenos don't listen to this guy senorita pleased to meet you

1390
04:56:01,959 --> 04:56:05,720
Rico and I were just discussing the situation with zona dose and you know

1391
04:56:07,000 --> 04:56:10,200
Like a mouse in my coffee for a second. It's an ice cube. I did

1392
04:56:12,680 --> 04:56:16,200
Okay, this is a very cool, I can't wait to understand the story

1393
04:56:24,360 --> 04:56:31,880
All right, hold on is the water is a beard made out of water

1394
04:56:47,369 --> 04:56:52,750
Look better. That looks kind of all right

1395
04:56:58,159 --> 04:57:00,159
Apply the 3ds settings

1396
04:57:00,560 --> 04:57:01,520
Yeah

1397
04:57:01,520 --> 04:57:02,959
I need

1398
04:57:02,959 --> 04:57:04,959
I need sasau

1399
04:57:05,599 --> 04:57:07,599
I don't think I don't need to turn on sasau

1400
04:57:13,150 --> 04:57:14,990
Now do max settings

1401
04:57:14,990 --> 04:57:16,990
No, I don't like the way games look with max settings

1402
04:57:17,979 --> 04:57:19,979
They look overproduced

1403
04:57:25,770 --> 04:57:28,650
You know why there's a lot of your favorite first person shooter?

1404
04:57:29,430 --> 04:57:34,250
Streamers play on low settings because of all the lights and graphics and illuminations

1405
04:57:34,330 --> 04:57:37,549
No, it's easier to play a game and see when it's not on like maximum settings

1406
04:57:46,779 --> 04:58:01,209
Yes, it is type in professional counter-strike player low graphics and you tell me what you find come on

1407
04:58:01,209 --> 04:58:03,209
On

1408
04:58:03,209 --> 04:58:16,759
Damn it. I didn't get it

1409
04:58:16,759 --> 04:58:21,560
Yes, you need to type in professional counter-strike player graphics settings

1410
04:58:27,400 --> 04:58:36,729
Why did that guy do it like that? It's rolling. He's right

1411
04:58:37,529 --> 04:58:40,569
I know that people play on low graphics so they can see the game better

1412
04:58:42,189 --> 04:58:45,470
Just type in computer professional counter-strike graphics

1413
04:58:46,270 --> 04:58:47,450
commands

1414
04:58:47,450 --> 04:58:49,450
professional csgo player

1415
04:58:49,470 --> 04:58:58,360
All right, what a mission am I gonna do before I like turn off the stream? How about that one?

1416
04:59:01,549 --> 04:59:04,669
Now just go open with the google search and type in your computer type in

1417
04:59:07,229 --> 04:59:14,029
What should I put my graphic settings on if i'm going to play professional counter-strike? What is a pro player's setup?

1418
04:59:14,110 --> 04:59:16,590
Do they use low settings type that in your computer?

1419
04:59:17,630 --> 04:59:38,119
How do you use turbo jump turbo jump? Oh, no jump jump jump jump jump jump jump

1420
04:59:42,159 --> 04:59:43,840
Did it bounce

1421
04:59:43,840 --> 04:59:46,400
No, it's turned to shit. Okay, whatever

1422
04:59:46,560 --> 04:59:47,759
Oh

1423
04:59:47,759 --> 04:59:51,599
He's my grenade launcher sick

1424
04:59:52,319 --> 04:59:54,319
Dude, thanks for the fucking heads up man

1425
04:59:54,880 --> 05:00:08,080
I need this

1426
05:00:08,080 --> 05:00:21,880
Keep at it people

1427
05:00:22,119 --> 05:01:01,979
Am I still alive?

1428
05:01:03,419 --> 05:01:17,000
Hey, did you hear the song that's why we're next to a bad guy

1429
05:01:18,810 --> 05:01:20,810
What the heck is spawning right to a bad guy?

1430
05:01:21,610 --> 05:01:23,610
What the heck?

1431
05:01:24,599 --> 05:01:26,919
Get out of here. You're gonna hear a bad guy

1432
05:01:28,040 --> 05:01:54,220

1590
05:21:40,799 --> 05:21:47,130
I don't know. Maybe i'll play it again

1591
05:21:51,340 --> 05:21:53,580
I want the 3ds version. It's probably pretty good

1592
05:21:56,799 --> 05:21:59,099

I I don't think that's correct

1604
05:23:00,569 --> 05:23:03,049
12 pst. No, it's got to be later than that

1605
05:23:08,540 --> 05:23:10,299
game awards

1606
05:23:10,299 --> 05:23:17,130
The game awards are

1607
05:23:17,270 --> 05:23:18,970
5 30 pst

1608
05:23:18,970 --> 05:23:22,000
Okay

1609
05:23:22,000 --> 05:23:28,840
So at 5 30 pst is when the stream's gonna be tomorrow and we're just gonna have fun

1610
05:23:29,849 --> 05:23:32,409
There'll be a face cam there, you know

1611
05:23:32,569 --> 05:23:42,939
Maybe if I feel like turning it on but yeah, uh, let's get to the bits

1612
05:23:43,419 --> 05:23:46,720
Let's put the outro on the screen. Thanks for sticking around

1613
05:23:47,520 --> 05:23:50,330
Hope you had a good time. I did

1614
05:23:50,330 --> 05:23:53,049
And I I did burp a few times on stream, but it's okay

1615
05:23:55,950 --> 05:24:02,029
And let's bring ourselves back to just under five and a half hours ago

1616
05:24:04,439 --> 05:24:07,159
We had three dollars from divas. Thank you divas with three bucks

1617
05:24:07,799 --> 05:24:14,250
Mostly lost gave one dollar. The reason I was tilted earlier is because you always go live five minutes before I need to leave

1618
05:24:14,810 --> 05:24:23,419
I'm sorry about that. You know, I'm sorry about that

1619
05:24:26,349 --> 05:24:28,349
That's the real end of the stream voice. Yeah, that is

1620
05:24:28,990 --> 05:24:37,709
But thank you mostly lost but the two dollars total here obviously you need to operate on my schedule and you can't go live until I say

1621
05:24:37,709 --> 05:24:42,240
So it's very difficult. I will tell you

1622
05:24:42,880 --> 05:24:45,180
Especially being on pacific time now. It's

1623
05:24:45,819 --> 05:24:48,439
When you're on pst, you have to remember

1624
05:24:49,240 --> 05:24:51,240
You're essentially back in time

1625
05:24:51,979 --> 05:24:53,020
because

1626
05:24:53,020 --> 05:24:55,369
noon pacific

1627
05:24:55,369 --> 05:24:57,369
Or even like 10 a.m pacific

1628
05:24:58,169 --> 05:25:00,169
Is 10 11 12 1

1629
05:25:00,889 --> 05:25:03,770
2 3 4 5 6 it's like 6 or 7 o'clock eu

1630
05:25:04,750 --> 05:25:08,909
If I got up at like 9 in the morning and streamed at 9 in the morning it'd be like 5 o'clock in the afternoon

1631
05:25:10,490 --> 05:25:17,229
That's kind of insane

1632
05:25:17,229 --> 05:25:19,919
Sorry if time zones

1633
05:25:20,000 --> 05:25:23,919
Uh screw up your viewing habits. I'm sorry that it's like that

1634
05:25:28,000 --> 05:25:30,319
Sorry to hear about your the pacific time

1635
05:25:33,580 --> 05:25:37,500
Uh lorag 100 dollars lorag 98 100 dollars earlier

1636
05:25:40,189 --> 05:25:43,549
Thank you so much sir feline one dollar. Shit. The ground is shaking

1637
05:25:45,799 --> 05:25:49,400

1638
05:25:49,959 --> 05:25:51,959

1639
05:25:52,040 --> 05:25:58,560
Uh, just an eu guy passing by. I hope you had a good time. Good night germa fireman. I think we got

1640
05:25:59,790 --> 05:26:03,069
I think we got fun out of this. Maybe we didn't get 60 dollars worth of fun

1641
05:26:03,150 --> 05:26:06,830
No, maybe I don't know we got like we got like at least 17 dollars worth of fun

1642
05:26:08,799 --> 05:26:13,279
If I had you know, if I keep playing it the next couple days and maybe i'll get like 41 dollars of fun

1643
05:26:13,919 --> 05:26:20,970
I'm, not sure

1644
05:26:20,970 --> 05:26:22,970
60 dollars for a 3ds game

1645
05:26:25,049 --> 05:26:27,229
It's kind of ridiculous, isn't it?

1646
05:26:28,319 --> 05:26:31,279
Uh, thank you freddy c for the two bucks. They just say beautiful. Thank you

1647
05:26:32,240 --> 05:26:36,000
Sly 161. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey germa. I know chat didn't really like watching it

1648
05:26:36,560 --> 05:26:40,639
But two point hospital got new dlc wanted to let you know because I know you enjoyed the game

1649
05:26:42,080 --> 05:26:43,759
Yeah, I don't know what it was

1650
05:26:43,759 --> 05:26:46,639
What was with okay two I had to turn down two point hospital

1651
05:26:47,520 --> 05:26:49,099
and

1652
05:26:49,099 --> 05:26:52,779
A lot of you guys were acting as if I was just blowing a fire alarm through your speakers

1653
05:26:53,500 --> 05:26:59,599
Like I had to turn that off. It was a bullhorn next to a fire alarm

1654
05:27:00,080 --> 05:27:09,099
It was bad. I don't know

1655
05:27:09,099 --> 05:27:15,340
Okay, the only I I have like at least three times where i've looked over and been like why is everybody so fucking angry?

1656
05:27:16,520 --> 05:27:17,720
um

1657
05:27:17,720 --> 05:27:19,630

octogen stream two

1659
05:27:21,950 --> 05:27:24,509
Was another one of those two point hospitals where

1660
05:27:25,389 --> 05:27:31,500
Everyone everyone was just hating everything. That's the only two that I could really actually think of where it was like, whoa

1661
05:27:32,380 --> 05:27:35,130
Everybody's very mad right now

1662
05:27:42,909 --> 05:27:44,909
Yeah, I did two octogen streams

1663
05:27:44,990 --> 05:27:56,360
That's the only two times I think I could really pinpoint when I would it was just like well people are very angry with me

1664
05:27:57,630 --> 05:28:01,470
Nintendo labo was like that too, but I but I was shit faced so I don't even know what you're talking about

1669
05:28:18,159 --> 05:28:20,400
But I just spent the last of my grocery money on these bits

1670

I don't know. I that looked okay except for christmas beard

1680
05:29:11,900 --> 05:29:17,599
It was a little janky and ugly

1681
05:29:18,319 --> 05:29:20,880
There was a lot of aliasing and it was very bright

1682
05:29:21,599 --> 05:29:28,970
Actually, it did look pretty bad. You're right. Never mind, but thank you though

I've watched you on youtube for a while about four years ago is when I started though

1698
05:30:54,680 --> 05:31:02,959
I would say how much I love your content for your four years ago is when I started though. It's a long time

1699
05:31:05,040 --> 05:31:09,819
Thank you for being here for this long. It's weird because

1700
05:31:10,459 --> 05:31:14,569
The 10 year is going to be coming up here in a couple of years

1701
05:31:15,819 --> 05:31:19,099
Just over two and a half years, right?

1702
05:31:19,099 --> 05:31:21,099
Once we hit 2020

1703
05:31:21,840 --> 05:31:23,840
That would be because I started in 2011

1704
05:31:24,479 --> 05:31:32,060
So we're talking about only another two to three years before that's that's a full decade that i've been doing youtube and twitch

1705
05:31:32,779 --> 05:31:36,430
What am I going to do for the 10 year anniversary?

1706
05:31:38,159 --> 05:31:40,880
I have no idea

1707
05:31:40,880 --> 05:31:42,880

Peter came in with 10

1773
05:36:45,450 --> 05:36:48,110
community subs

1774
05:36:48,110 --> 05:36:50,110
tater with 10 community subs

1775
05:36:54,409 --> 05:37:06,080

I'll try my absolute damnedest

1779
05:37:31,389 --> 05:37:37,369
Buy 12 pounds of eggs. That's a lot of eggs

1780
05:37:41,580 --> 05:37:43,580
Much love to you guys. Seriously. Thank you

1781
05:37:46,349 --> 05:37:51,310
Trying to get on track with the bits again here after an explosion of subs

1782
05:37:54,880 --> 05:37:57,119
Thank you flug boy for the one dollar

1783
05:37:57,119 --> 05:38:00,240
I hope you're doing all right germ just want to say the green screen movie night by my entire rest of the year

1784
05:38:00,639 --> 05:38:05,360
It was great. I also hope we didn't ruin any chances of you wanting to watch jojo

1785
05:38:06,779 --> 05:38:10,169
No, that's okay

1786
05:38:10,169 --> 05:38:12,810
I told you 2019 the one anime is gonna be jojo

1787
05:38:13,610 --> 05:38:15,610
I'm gonna watch season one

1788
05:38:16,189 --> 05:38:17,930
only

1789
05:38:17,930 --> 05:38:22,330
Everyone wanted me to do that. They said watch season one season one is the way you should watch i'm like, okay fine

1790
05:38:22,409 --> 05:38:26,189
I'll watch season one

1791
05:38:27,150 --> 05:38:31,279
Uh, but thank you garfield the monday killer for the one dollar

1792
05:38:32,000 --> 05:38:35,200
Garfield thought of a strange scenario if there was a week-long purge

1793
05:38:35,840 --> 05:38:38,400
Who are two guys you would trust to protect you?

1794
05:38:39,619 --> 05:38:45,080
Stipulation you can pick fictional characters. They can't have any superpowers. So batman would be allowed

1795
05:38:45,560 --> 05:38:47,560
But he can only use gadgets

1796
05:38:49,000 --> 05:38:51,000
They're not capable of turning against you

1797
05:38:51,560 --> 05:38:53,959
So if you hire the joker, he can only protect you

1798
05:38:55,439 --> 05:38:58,560
Garfield would choose mr. Rogers and pooh bear

1799
05:38:59,200 --> 05:39:02,009
Okay

1800
05:39:02,009 --> 05:39:03,549
Um

1801
05:39:03,549 --> 05:39:06,840
And that's very easy

1802
05:39:06,840 --> 05:39:07,799
God

1803
05:39:07,799 --> 05:39:12,029
Wait, is god of super be a good hold on. Wait. No that no, I don't know. Um

1804
05:39:12,990 --> 05:39:23,979
What I picked to protect me, you know, I would I would pick garfield i'd pick garfield

1805
05:39:25,229 --> 05:39:29,330
And man would we get ourselves in some real dangerous situations?

1806
05:39:45,599 --> 05:39:51,840
You know, I picked garfield and like garfield it's like a fucking 100 people coming to get me get out there

1807
05:39:53,439 --> 05:39:55,439
Yeah, go get them

1808
05:39:55,520 --> 05:39:57,520
There's a hundred of them go get them

1809
05:39:57,849 --> 05:40:03,979
You gotta protect me

1810
05:40:03,979 --> 05:40:07,819
And the second person I would pick because garfield would it would would just be destroyed in a second

1811
05:40:08,380 --> 05:40:10,380
Uh, the second person would be

1812
05:40:11,180 --> 05:40:18,830
um

1813
05:40:18,830 --> 05:40:22,599
hmm

1814
05:40:28,439 --> 05:40:32,799
Doesn't have superpowers

1815
05:40:35,389 --> 05:40:37,389
It'd have to be somebody huge

1816
05:40:37,470 --> 05:40:40,110
That's really fast. That's really strong

1817
05:40:40,750 --> 05:40:44,220
All right. Can I pick can I pick like the mountain from game of thrones?

1818
05:40:44,779 --> 05:40:55,130
Does it mean that's like

1819
05:40:55,450 --> 05:40:57,450
Okay, so it'd be garfield and then the mountain

1820
05:41:01,799 --> 05:41:07,240
Somebody would just shoot him. But this is a world with no guns, right? It's just who do you whatever?

1821
05:41:08,119 --> 05:41:10,119
That okay. I would pick a guy that had a gun

1822
05:41:11,659 --> 05:41:17,080
And it was very good at it. I'd pick like 47 or something

1823
05:41:20,729 --> 05:41:22,729
A gun is not a superpower

1824
05:41:26,880 --> 05:41:29,200
Thank you garfield. Thank you captain worgen for the one dollar

1825
05:41:30,159 --> 05:41:32,159

1826

1832
05:41:48,970 --> 05:41:51,799

05:41:51,799 --> 05:41:54,000

1844
05:42:22,779 --> 05:42:28,299
And beat flame lurker first try and hit all of the targets in point blank two

1845
05:42:28,700 --> 05:42:32,139
Which is nearly fucking 100 percent impossible

1846
05:42:33,580 --> 05:42:35,150
so

1847
05:42:35,150 --> 05:42:37,770
Take that with what you will I guess

1848
05:42:45,790 --> 05:42:50,110

Does anybody else feel like it's broken

1867
05:43:52,959 --> 05:43:57,130
I think it might be broken

1868
05:43:57,130 --> 05:43:59,130
Is it just in a constant never-ending loop?

1869
05:44:01,759 --> 05:44:03,119
It might be

1870
05:44:03,119 --> 05:44:12,009
Wait, hold on

1871
05:44:12,009 --> 05:44:14,759

Thanks for the two bucks. They say fail fish

1912
05:47:23,959 --> 05:47:26,520
I must have done something real stupid

1913
05:47:27,319 --> 05:47:32,119
There was a point there in the middle of that

1914
05:47:32,439 --> 05:47:34,939
before the ds bit

1915
05:47:36,299 --> 05:47:39,259
I I think i've ran into the ground like seven times in a row

1916
05:47:41,720 --> 05:47:45,880
Thank you springfield for the two dollars fifty cents. Hey germa. I've been wondering for my entire life

1917
05:47:46,520 --> 05:47:51,319
What happened to the gift of flight video? It's my favorite video of all time and it's gone missing what gives

1918
05:47:52,599 --> 05:47:54,599
I've explained it a few times before

1919
05:47:54,840 --> 05:47:57,319
But there was a point when I was trying to clean up the channel

1920
05:47:58,279 --> 05:47:59,240
of

1921
05:47:59,240 --> 05:48:00,740
terrible

1922
05:48:00,740 --> 05:48:03,720
13 and seven fucking call of duty kill confirm videos

1923
05:48:04,520 --> 05:48:08,599
That I just hated I was like, I don't want this on the chin and I went through and I was checking boxes

1924
05:48:09,080 --> 05:48:11,080
And I was like wait, what's this?

1925
05:48:11,479 --> 05:48:13,720
And some of them just got checked that I shouldn't have checked

1926
05:48:15,450 --> 05:48:18,250
There was a period where I don't know man. Like I got they get to a point where

1927
05:48:19,130 --> 05:48:21,529
There was somebody like videos that I wanted the channel to be more

1928
05:48:22,150 --> 05:48:26,830
Focused and I was like embarrassed that people could go back and watch

1929
05:48:27,389 --> 05:48:31,790
Some of those terrible fucking videos where I literally just played call of duty for like eight minutes

1930
05:48:32,669 --> 05:48:34,669
And uploaded whatever fucking happened

1931
05:48:34,990 --> 05:48:41,630
And I only did that like five times so ten times maybe total of the nearly thousand videos that I uploaded on that channel

1932
05:48:42,669 --> 05:48:44,430
so

1933
05:48:44,430 --> 05:48:47,549
You know, I I mean I was starting to get a little bit more viewership

1934
05:48:47,950 --> 05:48:53,150
I was making content that I like to make more than something like that and people were going to go back at the beginning

1935
05:48:53,229 --> 05:48:56,189
Of the channel and oh no, here's like what's what are these videos?

1936
05:48:56,270 --> 05:49:00,110
I'm going to watch these and be like, well, never mind. Let me unsubscribe this guy. I don't like this

1937
05:49:01,069 --> 05:49:12,720
So it would get caught in the crossfires of me trying to clean the channel up

1938
05:49:13,439 --> 05:49:15,439
Of like stuff that I thought was bad

1939
05:49:16,240 --> 05:49:18,430
bad as in

1940
05:49:18,430 --> 05:49:20,430
Like not good to watch

1941
05:49:20,970 --> 05:49:23,610
But sorry that some of those videos were removed

1942
05:49:27,610 --> 05:49:33,080
But thank you springfield for the 250. Hopefully that is a that is an explanation

1943
05:49:34,159 --> 05:49:38,540

Thank you so much kairatobi

1946
05:49:44,200 --> 05:49:48,439
Uh chat can thank snowy on discord for the edit. Here's a fixed version

1947
05:49:52,520 --> 05:49:54,520

Yeah, thank you all of you guys that threw together in less than five minutes

1949
05:50:02,479 --> 05:50:05,119
Photoshopped hands and screen skewing

1950
05:50:05,680 --> 05:50:09,639

1951
05:50:09,639 --> 05:50:12,360
Uh smelly boy. Thanks for the one dollar play geoguessr

Thank you. I put it in my 3ds joke fund

1954
05:50:23,450 --> 05:50:27,130
Savior of the dreaming dead. Thanks for the one dollar. How exactly did we get here?

1955
05:50:28,520 --> 05:50:30,520
Um, I turned the graphics down

1956
05:50:31,069 --> 05:50:32,270
all the way

1957
05:50:32,270 --> 05:50:35,810
In just cause and it looked like nintendo 64 or 3ds

1958
05:50:36,669 --> 05:50:41,470
So then it was like this is a 3ds game. Oh, okay. Hold on a second and then it just spiraled out of control

1959
05:50:41,950 --> 05:50:45,930
That's what happened. It's kind of how it went down

1960
05:50:48,639 --> 05:50:54,959
Uh carrot, thank you carrot for the one dollar the fucking 3ds. I can't even type i'm laughing too hard

1961
05:50:57,819 --> 05:51:00,540
Glad you thought it was funny. Thanks for the one dollar, dude

1962
05:51:01,880 --> 05:51:03,799
Hey shoot man. Thank you shoot me for the one dollar

1963
05:51:03,799 --> 05:51:08,520
I feel the need to admit that I watched the green screen movie night for an hour before realizing i'd already seen it

1964
05:51:09,080 --> 05:51:10,680
And it wasn't live

1965
05:51:10,680 --> 05:51:12,680
Thanks for the free content you smooth

1966
05:51:13,319 --> 05:51:15,389
brain stallion

1967
05:51:15,389 --> 05:51:28,680

Thank you to mostly lost for the one dollar. You're the top just cause four streamer on twitch

1969
05:51:36,840 --> 05:51:44,009
By a large margin doesn't I mean that doesn't really surprise me because i'm playing it like three days late

1970
05:51:45,340 --> 05:51:47,740
You know what I mean? Didn't this come out like on monday or something?

1971
05:51:48,990 --> 05:51:50,990
So anyone that was gonna stream it?

1972
05:51:55,680 --> 05:52:02,700
Anyone that was gonna stream it probably already did it right? It came out yesterday. Oh, well

1973
05:52:06,639 --> 05:52:09,299
Three three days yesterday ago

1974
05:52:09,299 --> 05:52:12,110

05:52:19,840 --> 05:52:21,040
Really really?

1977
05:52:21,040 --> 05:52:29,470
I mean, that's a I don't really know what to say, you know being in the top position on any given game is

1978
05:52:31,340 --> 05:52:34,299
This is an honor right because it's like oh, wow. Okay

1979
05:52:36,020 --> 05:52:37,860
That's really cool

1980
05:52:37,860 --> 05:52:39,860
Hopefully people like the stream

1981
05:52:43,360 --> 05:52:45,360

Ten bucks. Thank you

1989
05:53:13,119 --> 05:53:15,119
Pre-recorded stream skip what?

1990
05:53:16,099 --> 05:53:19,220
Uh danda dump. Thanks for the one dollar. I just spent money to tell you

1991
05:53:19,220 --> 05:53:22,419
This is the dumbest joke I think you've ever done keep up the good work

1992
05:53:23,060 --> 05:53:25,060
Just you fucking wait

1993
05:53:25,979 --> 05:53:28,080
Just wait

1994
05:53:28,080 --> 05:53:34,860
I would I would just wait before you say that okay

1995
05:53:36,000 --> 05:53:39,490
That's all I need to say

1996
05:53:39,490 --> 05:53:40,529
but

1997
05:53:40,529 --> 05:53:42,740
I thought it was really fun

1998
05:53:42,740 --> 05:53:48,340
Uh ren, thank you ren for the five dollars. They just say pogchamp pogchamp pogchamp

1999
05:53:48,979 --> 05:53:54,450
Thank you

2000
05:53:54,450 --> 05:53:56,450
Uh, thank you there

2001
05:53:57,090 --> 05:54:01,569
Or there nor there nor for the one dollar top 3ds gamer

2002
05:54:04,619 --> 05:54:07,900
You can you I remember a long time ago. I wanted to capture the 3ds

2003
05:54:08,779 --> 05:54:10,560
and it was

2004
05:54:10,560 --> 05:54:14,959
Nearly impossible you have don't you have to get a separate device from a third party?

2005
05:54:16,659 --> 05:54:21,139
That lets you hook into the hooks in the back of the 3ds and let's you plug it into hdmi or something

2006
05:54:25,220 --> 05:54:27,479
You have to actually mod your 3ds

2007
05:54:30,340 --> 05:54:36,590
I don't think there's anything I really would want to stream on 3ds. Anyways, maybe the warriorware game

2008
05:54:37,869 --> 05:54:44,029
But we already played all the warriorwares a long time ago. That's probably that's really the only thing i'd want to play

2009
05:54:45,889 --> 05:54:48,560
Just use the webcam

2010
05:54:48,560 --> 05:54:50,560
Go back to like 2007 youtube

2011
05:54:51,549 --> 05:54:54,110
Hey dan with wings. Thanks for the ten dollars dan

2012
05:54:55,819 --> 05:54:59,259
Hey, germa just want to let you know that the 3ds bit was the hardest i've laughed in a live stream

2013
05:55:00,110 --> 05:55:03,950
Uh stuff like this is why you're the only streamer I still watch keep it up slugger

2014
05:55:07,729 --> 05:55:09,900
Thank you

2015
05:55:09,900 --> 05:55:12,939
I hope you still think that in another week

2016
05:55:13,500 --> 05:55:16,139
Another day another month another year

2017
05:55:18,419 --> 05:55:24,180
Hope you still have fun. Thank you. Thank you smacklesmore for the one dollar germy

2018
05:55:24,180 --> 05:55:29,139
You're the funniest and most creative streamer and also very handsome. I mean

2019
05:55:29,779 --> 05:55:31,459
Those are those are like three

2020
05:55:31,459 --> 05:55:34,419
Three like super nice adjectives, you know what I mean?

2021
05:55:39,069 --> 05:55:40,590
All I can say is thank you

2022
05:55:40,590 --> 05:55:48,110
Appreciate it. Kyratopia. Thanks for the one dollar. Uh from snowy again in the discord in case the joke ever comes back

2023
05:55:54,020 --> 05:55:56,020
Yeah, it's just like a blank slate

2024
05:55:56,419 --> 05:56:02,740
That's so funny. I'm gonna have to hold on to this because if in case that ever comes back I have a perfect image

2025
05:56:03,630 --> 05:56:06,909
Thank you

2026
05:56:06,909 --> 05:56:09,709
Uh, mr. Wink. Thanks for the dollar 50. They just say

2027
05:56:10,509 --> 05:56:15,979
Who who I think that's the that's like the point two second gnome video, right?

2028
05:56:16,939 --> 05:56:20,060
Uh mostly lost. Thanks for the one dollar. If you went back and looked at all my bit messages

2029
05:56:20,060 --> 05:56:23,020
They probably amount to abuse what?

2030
05:56:25,060 --> 05:56:28,130
No, you're fine. Don't worry

2031
05:56:32,110 --> 05:56:35,790
Uh, thank you jess for the one dollar smash comes out this week any plans on that?

2032
05:56:37,119 --> 05:56:38,959
Um, I think so

2033
05:56:38,959 --> 05:56:41,860
But I don't want I don't want to turn on smash on launch day

2034
05:56:42,880 --> 05:56:44,159
because

2035
05:56:44,240 --> 05:56:49,040
I'd like to unlock the characters and at least get familiar with it before I try to do anything with it

2036
05:56:53,490 --> 05:56:54,770
We'll see

2037
05:56:54,770 --> 05:56:57,409
There is a possibility that you will see smash brothers

2038
05:57:00,509 --> 05:57:02,509
on the channel maybe

2039
05:57:03,490 --> 05:57:06,930
Uh stream the story mode. I don't know if that would be I don't know if that's that interesting though

2040
05:57:08,529 --> 05:57:10,529
It's just kind of fighting against bots

2041
05:57:11,250 --> 05:57:15,139
I'd rather get familiar and then do an actual

2042
05:57:16,000 --> 05:57:19,860
Multiplayer stream where I fucking decimate everybody as pac-man

2043
05:57:20,580 --> 05:57:34,990
We'll see but yeah, that is exciting does come out soon. Thank you though

2044
05:57:35,630 --> 05:57:40,110
Uh maxie kaspersky. Thanks for the one dollar. I'm something of a community sub myself

2045
05:57:40,669 --> 05:57:43,200
Well, they sure have given a lot. So

2046
05:57:43,200 --> 05:57:48,130
Thank you. Jerk tc gave 15 bucks 15 from jerk tc

2047
05:57:48,209 --> 05:57:51,970
I'm here cuddling a kitten and having goosebumps because I like your videos so much

2048
05:57:52,689 --> 05:57:57,490
I'm a huge fan of goosebumps, too

2049
05:57:58,290 --> 05:58:01,090
I especially love the abominable snowman one

2050
05:58:01,810 --> 05:58:02,930
I love

2051
05:58:02,930 --> 05:58:04,930
the um

2052
05:58:05,169 --> 05:58:07,169
Attack of the dummy in the in the attic

2053
05:58:07,569 --> 05:58:11,700
Whatever that one's called

2054
05:58:11,700 --> 05:58:13,700
But in all seriousness, thank you

2055
05:58:16,270 --> 05:58:19,869
I'm very happy that you think that this is worth watching

2056
05:58:22,590 --> 05:58:24,349
I hope I can continue to

2057
05:58:24,349 --> 05:58:30,000
Have you feel that way? Thank you for the 15 dollars. Thank you. Timmy tim tan for the one dollar

Couldn't come

05:59:07,680 --> 05:59:09,360
Why not?

2068
05:59:09,360 --> 05:59:13,279

05:59:14,560 --> 05:59:20,959
Why didn't you call me? I wanted to call you but um

I waited for one hour

2076
05:59:50,740 --> 05:59:52,740
I just lost yours

2077
05:59:53,540 --> 05:59:58,580
If you want to learn english

2078
05:59:58,580 --> 06:00:03,970
Go check it out

2079
06:00:03,970 --> 06:00:08,209
Thank you timmy tim tan. Thank you up quark for the one dollar. If you had to bring back one old meme

2080
06:00:08,209 --> 06:00:10,990
What would you bring back?

2081
06:00:10,990 --> 06:00:16,159
um

2082
06:00:16,159 --> 06:00:20,959
None of them. I don't think no i'd rather i'd rather see

2083
06:00:21,840 --> 06:00:23,840
And do new stuff

2084
06:00:25,060 --> 06:00:28,979
You know, we can always remember the old ones

2085
06:00:29,619 --> 06:00:32,290
But there's new ones to make

2086
06:00:32,290 --> 06:00:42,110
You understand all your bass are belong to us. No, I don't mean like in in history

2087
06:00:47,889 --> 06:00:50,610
Thank you though clueless sniper. Thanks for the one dollar. Hey germa

2088
06:00:50,610 --> 06:00:52,770
I was wondering if you plan on doing another movie night

2089
06:00:52,770 --> 06:00:56,529
I had a lot of fun making my weather channel video and I hope I have a couple more ideas

2090
06:00:58,509 --> 06:01:00,509
I don't really have a plan

2091
06:01:00,590 --> 06:01:03,950
to do a second one

2092
06:01:03,950 --> 06:01:04,909
but

2093
06:01:04,909 --> 06:01:06,430
I might

2094
06:01:06,430 --> 06:01:08,909
There's a possibility where we could figure out something fun

2095
06:01:09,970 --> 06:01:13,569
Where you have to make something very specific, you know what I mean?

2096
06:01:14,610 --> 06:01:16,610
So instead of just literally anything

2097
06:01:17,630 --> 06:01:20,909
There's maybe like a few different categories you could put it into

2098
06:01:22,529 --> 06:01:31,979
But I don't know this I don't really have like a plan for it certain categories maybe

2099
06:01:34,240 --> 06:01:38,479
But i'm very very happy with what happened and how it turned out and i've seen um

2100
06:01:39,680 --> 06:01:44,939
A lot of people discussing it and i've seen all the people had a lot of fun

2101
06:01:44,939 --> 06:01:48,299
I'm really happy about that. I've also seen a little bit of criticism and I can understand that

2102
06:01:49,259 --> 06:01:51,119
uh

2103
06:01:51,119 --> 06:01:53,119
It was very very difficult

2104
06:01:54,029 --> 06:01:56,750
To because this was never supposed to be a contest, right?

2105
06:01:58,130 --> 06:02:01,169
I wanted to try to include as many people as possible

2106
06:02:05,459 --> 06:02:07,790
because

2107
06:02:07,790 --> 06:02:09,790
If okay, let's say for instance, okay

2108
06:02:09,790 --> 06:02:14,750
Uh, oh there was like seven or eight jojo videos, right? That's and then okay

2109
06:02:14,750 --> 06:02:17,470
Yeah, that's it's a lot. Well, maybe I think there's actually 15

2110
06:02:18,479 --> 06:02:20,380
but

2111
06:02:20,380 --> 06:02:22,380
There were people spent a lot of time on them

2112
06:02:22,860 --> 06:02:26,939
And I didn't want to have it because at that point it's okay this all these submissions

2113
06:02:27,659 --> 06:02:32,540
Well, i've got to get rid of all these and uh, only one of these videos can make it in you know

2114
06:02:32,540 --> 06:02:34,540
What I mean at that point it becomes a contest

2115
06:02:34,860 --> 06:02:38,060
rather than just like a night of just putting up as much as we possibly can

2116
06:02:38,939 --> 06:02:40,060
which is

2117
06:02:40,060 --> 06:02:41,580
That was the purpose of

2118
06:02:41,580 --> 06:02:43,580
The this last sunday, you know

2119
06:02:45,630 --> 06:02:50,189
I didn't want to really exclude very many submissions. It was hard to exclude a bunch of them

2120
06:02:50,189 --> 06:02:53,470
But some of them really couldn't be used for various reasons

2121
06:02:54,189 --> 06:03:06,880
But it was more of a community night than like a video contest

2122
06:03:07,599 --> 06:03:10,880
There is plenty of potential to do a video contest

2123
06:03:11,680 --> 06:03:25,810
We'll see but I had a lot of fun

2124
06:03:26,290 --> 06:03:28,290
And I said this on the stream before

2125
06:03:28,939 --> 06:03:30,939
At the end and at the beginning and midway through

2126
06:03:31,869 --> 06:03:35,709
I was absolutely blown away by how just how fucking creative

2127
06:03:37,500 --> 06:03:39,500
So many of you guys are so

2128
06:03:40,900 --> 06:03:48,270
I loved every second of it. Thank you asha for the five dollars asha 108

2129
06:03:48,270 --> 06:03:56,819
You're still the number one pub g streamer on ipad and I will keep my number one chicken dinner slot

2130
06:03:57,459 --> 06:04:02,619
As the number one mobile ipad pub g streamer

2131
06:04:04,779 --> 06:04:07,740
Thank you though for the five dollars. Thank you. Errol is for the one dollar germa earth. Thank you

2132
06:04:08,380 --> 06:04:11,919
Honey chain. Thanks for the one dollar. Thank you all the great videos and streams over the years

2133
06:04:14,099 --> 06:04:16,099
Thank you for watching the videos in the streams

2134
06:04:16,659 --> 06:04:19,540
Honey chain, thank you

2135
06:04:19,540 --> 06:04:25,139
And then finally dubsky dude for one dollar when you were in that pit with the boulder and those random animals spawned

2136
06:04:25,700 --> 06:04:30,419
That was very eerily similar to your old space master video. It kind of freaked me out

2137
06:04:31,060 --> 06:04:35,639
All you new people need to look that video up you can find it on an ancient website called youtube.com

2138
06:04:41,099 --> 06:04:48,430
Animals I just remember the bird flying upside down and around the circle

2139
06:04:49,069 --> 06:04:51,069
It was like a parakeet or something

2140
06:04:55,229 --> 06:04:57,229
and then the

2141
06:05:00,540 --> 06:05:04,959
What a weird fucking game

2142
06:05:05,520 --> 06:05:07,599
Uh, that is it for the bits

2143
06:05:07,599 --> 06:05:15,220
Let's show the sub credits while we make our way out of here. Let's put them up on the screen. What do you say?

2144
06:05:18,430 --> 06:05:22,849
Here they come. I got a feeling there's gonna be a lot of these

2145
06:05:23,490 --> 06:05:25,729
Considering the amount of gifted subs that were tonight

2146
06:05:27,090 --> 06:05:30,849
Oh, yeah

2147
06:05:30,849 --> 06:05:32,369
Holy shit

2148
06:05:32,369 --> 06:05:39,520
That's going fast

2149
06:05:39,520 --> 06:05:41,759
That type of video is why you started watching in the first place

2150
06:05:44,900 --> 06:05:46,900
Yeah, I mean I I always tried

2151
06:05:47,279 --> 06:05:49,279
I don't know. I get bored really easily guys

2152
06:05:49,759 --> 06:05:52,270
I know that

2153
06:05:52,270 --> 06:05:56,430
Uh a lot of people ask. Well, what's your process when you go to make a video or a stream?

2154
06:05:57,310 --> 06:05:59,709
It's pretty it's very easy. I I get very bored

2155
06:06:00,819 --> 06:06:07,459
And I like to try to do new things every time or play something different or try a different video or try a different idea

2156
06:06:07,860 --> 06:06:10,900
Because if I do the same thing for too long, I it'll bore me. I just get bored

2157
06:06:21,650 --> 06:06:23,650
Ever put something that you know is fun

2158
06:06:24,209 --> 06:06:26,189
off

2159
06:06:26,189 --> 06:06:28,240
um

2160
06:06:28,240 --> 06:06:30,240
You mean like I was having a good time and then

2161
06:06:31,310 --> 06:06:33,310
I know I was having fun, but I turned it off

2162
06:06:35,740 --> 06:06:37,740
I don't think so. Maybe um

2163
06:06:40,060 --> 06:06:41,740
Like red dead two

2164
06:06:41,740 --> 06:06:42,619
No

2165
06:06:42,619 --> 06:06:55,680
What the hell does this explain this image?

2166
06:06:55,919 --> 06:06:58,990
It's four feet tall

2167
06:06:58,990 --> 06:07:00,990
44 54 inches

2168
06:07:02,689 --> 06:07:05,810
What are you what are you talking about? You don't know how tall the ceilings in my room are

2169
06:07:11,459 --> 06:07:13,459
You don't know how tall my ceilings are

2170
06:07:13,860 --> 06:07:17,889
I'm not 54 inches tall

2171
06:07:18,369 --> 06:07:20,799
I'm like 68 or something

2172
06:07:23,790 --> 06:07:29,919
Don't make me get a stick and stand next to it. Hold on a second here

2173
06:07:36,110 --> 06:07:40,750
I i'm like 65. Oh, no, no, no 68 or 69 inches tall

2174
06:07:44,590 --> 06:07:46,590
Yeah, i'm 69 inches tall

2175
06:07:46,669 --> 06:07:57,150
Look at look at all these subs

2176
06:07:57,310 --> 06:07:58,939
That's so many

2177
06:07:58,939 --> 06:08:00,939
That's so many in one day

2178
06:08:06,430 --> 06:08:08,430
That's the that's the funny number

2179
06:08:09,299 --> 06:08:12,419
That's fine

2180
06:08:12,419 --> 06:08:14,659
Just because it's the funny number doesn't mean it's the real one

2181
06:08:15,220 --> 06:08:22,799
Four and a half feet tall

2182
06:08:22,799 --> 06:08:24,959
You know, i'm gonna let you guys have this one. Okay?

2183
06:08:26,419 --> 06:08:34,779
sure

2184
06:08:34,779 --> 06:08:36,779
Oh bob bob champ we could have it

2185
06:08:40,240 --> 06:08:46,830
Don't let them have it. All right guys, i'll see you tomorrow for the game awards

2186
06:08:47,389 --> 06:08:54,240
It should be fun

2187
06:08:54,240 --> 06:08:55,680
Right at the very end

2188
06:08:55,680 --> 06:08:57,680
We had garfield the monday killer with the dollar

2189
06:08:58,319 --> 06:09:00,880
Garfield coming into the last second with one question

2190
06:09:01,860 --> 06:09:06,740
Uh, do you think the green screen streams and movie night streams would be a good thing to do as a yearly basis?

2191
06:09:07,220 --> 06:09:12,419
It felt appropriate to use the green screen stream and movie night to sandwich the rumble because all three streams seemed like a trinity of the

2192
06:09:12,419 --> 06:09:13,860
best of all

2193
06:09:13,860 --> 06:09:17,380
That i've ever offered

2194
06:09:18,909 --> 06:09:20,909
I told I talked about this once

2195
06:09:21,630 --> 06:09:25,470
Maybe a little bit more but I I want every since moving to las vegas

2196
06:09:26,349 --> 06:09:28,529
The whole point of coming out here

2197
06:09:28,849 --> 06:09:31,569
Was to try to dial it up to try to do more

2198
06:09:32,799 --> 06:09:33,599
to

2199
06:09:33,599 --> 06:09:35,599
every 30 to 45 days

2200
06:09:36,000 --> 06:09:38,000
Have something else going on

2201
06:09:38,580 --> 06:09:41,220
That was one of the number one reasons for being here

2202
06:09:41,939 --> 06:09:45,360
You know what I mean?

2203
06:09:45,360 --> 06:09:50,400
So a green screen it doesn't need to be a green screen. There's I have plans to do all kinds of shit

2204
06:09:53,020 --> 06:09:57,099
And the next thing that I plan on doing is probably going to be on christmas eve

2205
06:09:57,740 --> 06:10:00,060
That's a plan. I have a plan to do something on christmas eve

2206
06:10:04,159 --> 06:10:08,799
So they if you have been enjoying the last couple of weeks of the green screen stuff and then

2207
06:10:09,759 --> 06:10:10,639
um

2208
06:10:10,639 --> 06:10:15,279
The germa wrestling i'm trying to try i'm i'm going to dial it up to like 11, man

2209
06:10:21,200 --> 06:10:30,700
I start expecting that once a month 11 out of two

2210
06:10:31,580 --> 06:10:33,580
Oh, yeah, here it comes

2211
06:10:33,580 --> 06:10:36,130
Turn it up

2212
06:10:36,130 --> 06:10:37,779
one

2213
06:10:37,779 --> 06:10:39,139
one

2214
06:10:39,139 --> 06:10:43,700
Ah, let's just stay at one one. Let's stay at one. So pretty much i'm dialing it up to a one

2215
06:10:44,340 --> 06:10:51,709
At a 10

2216
06:10:51,709 --> 06:10:53,709
But that's my time

2217
06:10:53,709 --> 06:10:57,759
I have a wonderful rest of your evening. I'll see you tomorrow for the game awards. Have a great night
