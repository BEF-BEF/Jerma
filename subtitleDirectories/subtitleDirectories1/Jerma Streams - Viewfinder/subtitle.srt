1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,740
What he said, the lame title.

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,099
Well, I'm retired now, so I don't have to worry about that anymore.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,320
How's it going?

4
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,550
You're gonna play armored core.

5
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:26,489
Yeah.

6
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:33,469
We need to talk about armored core because, uh, I have some, I have some

7
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:41,479
thoughts, I have a few thoughts I've heard.

8
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,460
Uh, I've heard it's very, very, very difficult.

9
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:50,840
I've heard it has a very, very large learning curve.

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:02,299
And I mean, I would be jumping into, uh, return to the Jedi without watching

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,939
any of the other star Wars movies.

12
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:14,060
So, I don't know, maybe this is not true.

13
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,590
I heard it was really hard.

14
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,969
I heard it was okay.

15
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,329
Here's what I heard is that I love from software.

16
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,409
I love dark souls.

17
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,290
I love Elden ring.

18
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,090
Oh, yay.

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,489
Here comes another from software game.

20
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:31,250
It's just, this is not Elden ring, dude.

21
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:32,209
This is a different game.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,569
This is a completely different experience.

23
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:43,549
How about this?

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,060
I'll maybe I'll open it.

25
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,099
I'll try it.

26
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,980
But if it's clear that I'm just like completely have no idea what I'm doing.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,540
And it's just like, Oh, I'm having, I'm having a lot of trouble.

28
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,400
And we might just move away to something else that day.

29
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,140
You'll love it.

30
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,459
I I'll give it a try.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,000
I will.

32
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,389
But I've never played any of the armored core games, any of them.

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,030
I don't even know if I like this genre.

34
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,930
You know, I'll try the new food, but I will be honest with you at the restaurant.

35
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:23,409
Oh, Hey, try this.

36
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,409
It's, it's got, um, cilantro.

37
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:26,729
It's got a, the squid in it.

38
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,770
And it's, um, it's got a potato mash on top.

39
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,169
I'll try it, but I'm going to tell you, I'll take a bite.

40
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,449
And I'm going to go, it's all right.

41
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,990
Not for me.

42
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,610
Or I might go, Oh, nice.

43
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:39,849
You know what I'm saying?

44
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,849
Like, I don't, I I'll try the new food, but I can't offer it.

45
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,009
I can't promise I will love it.

46
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:50,219
What kind of freak doesn't like robots?

47
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:56,740
I, I like robots.

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,819
I just don't know if I'm going to be good at playing as a robot.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,159
Uh, but anyways, let's talk about the next, uh, week or so.

50
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,240
First of all, we're going to play viewfinder tonight.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,460
Today.

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,639
I have a plan to play bouncing duck simulator.

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,800
If not today, then be on Monday or something.

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,340
We'll see.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,349
Also at the end of this coming week, I want to continue sorcery part four.

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,860
And I will try.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,840
Uh, I almost just said assassin's creed six armored core six.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,330
That's the plan for this coming week.

59
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,729
Probably streaming and streaming today, streaming Monday, and then probably on

60
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:06,210
like Saturday, Sunday, maybe like Sunday this coming weekend, but for today, let's

61
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,340
play viewfinder of a Hilux two.

62
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,740
Yeah, I know.

63
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,810
We have to play the assassin's creed now.

64
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,660
He's never going to play Hilux.

65
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:31,389
I definitely will.

66
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,379
What about mine?

67
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:37,879
Quack.

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,360
I don't think so.

69
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,209
What about the Smurf cosplay stream?

70
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,470
I never said I was doing a Smurfs cosplay.

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
When are you going to reveal your balding?

72
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,180
Um, somebody in pre-stream chat said, Oh, Hey dude, like have you started balding?

73
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:06,540
And I was in the middle of typing reply to this person, but I stopped.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,980
And I deleted it all.

75
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:14,699
I deleted everything because I'm not going to even talk about that because you know

76
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:14,939
what I mean?

77
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,620
Like I, I'm not going to type or, or, or address like anything about me, my hair,

78
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,579
my balding or anything.

79
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,939
I'm not even going to talk about it.

80
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,379
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,259
Do you know what I mean by that?

82
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,939
Like, I'm not going to even start talking about that because I'm not, I

83
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:30,939
ain't manifesting anything.

84
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,009
So I am going to, uh, have no comment on that.

85
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,220
I, my hair is great.

86
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,779
I'm not making any comments besides that.

87
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,779
I've, I've got, I've got pretty good hair right now.

88
00:05:47,259 --> 00:06:01,540
The only comment I'm going to make, you address it constantly.

89
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:06,379
Yeah, but I address it jokingly constantly.

90
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,750
It was a, that was a real question in pre-stream and I was like, Oh yeah, well

91
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,430
here's the thing, man.

92
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,110
Like, let me tell you about, no, no, no, no.

93
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,589
I'm not going to, I'm not going to sincerely address it.

94
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,189
No way.

95
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,170
How many hotdogs do you think you could eat in 45 seconds?

96
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:21,529
Let me think.

97
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,860
Probably two, maybe, maybe full one.

98
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,139
I don't know.

99
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,019
I've never tried.

100
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:40,420
I would say one, one sounds like fine, maybe, but that's not something that I

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,060
something, that's not something I would recommend trying.

102
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:44,069
Yeah.

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,620
Uh, how about this?

104
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,459
How, how long do I have?

105
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,620
All right, give me a number.

106
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,009
Give me like 10 minutes or like, what's like the, um, how long in a hotdog

107
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:03,649
competition do you have to eat all the hotdogs that are out there?

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,850
What's like a typical hotdog competition timer?

109
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,480
10 minutes, 30 minutes.

110
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,579
Okay.

111
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,540
Uh, I would eat one over the course of 30 minutes and I would eat it with a

112
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,379
fork and knife during the competition.

113
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,980
Be like, here we go, everybody.

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,500
Welcome to the hotdog contest.

115
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,259
Let's go.

116
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,620
Three, two, one.

117
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,139
Let's fucking, everyone's freaking out and I just slowly take one and just

118
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,819
start cutting the end off and choosing which dipping sauce I'm going to put it

119
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:43,939
in.

120
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:45,740
No, that's what I'll do first.

121
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,220
I will make sure that, that there's 10 different dipping sauces and I slowly

122
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,839
make a little pool on the plate with each one and I will like make, oh,

123
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,079
exquisite faces every time I take a bite.

124
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:03,500
That was a Malcolm in the Middle joke.

125
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:04,259
That's a good one.

126
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,100
That's a, what a, that's a good episode.

127
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:06,500
That's real.

128
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,709
That was Malcolm in the, all right.

129
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,470
Well then, yeah, it's a, that's, that's a funny joke.

130
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:12,949
I like it.

131
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,910
I should watch that episode.

132
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,189
I don't think they even have dipping sauces past the water jug.

133
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,230
Once I get my headphones, it's over for you hoes.

134
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,230
I don't know how yet, but it will be.

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,879
What are you talking about?

136
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,370
That person is really excited to get a new pair of headphones.

137
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:04,279
And I'll tell you, I've been there before where you're just like, oh man, I'm going

138
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,639
to be powered up once I get this new thing.

139
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:12,940
You ever get, you ever just feel like completely energized.

140
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,379
There's like a new thing coming up.

141
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,350
Soft retirement, soft hair loss.

142
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,509
Do not out.

143
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,269
I actually want you to time that person out.

144
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,830
I don't want that message to be like recorded into history.

145
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,269
I want that message deleted because I don't want to manifest that.

146
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:32,629
I want that to be deleted.

147
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:36,450
And then here it comes here.

148
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:37,250
Everybody say it.

149
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:37,769
Here it comes.

150
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,179
I'm doing just fine.

151
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,980
I'm doing all right.

152
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,299
Manifest some fucking hair.

153
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,350
Yeah, it's luscious right now.

154
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:58,190
I've been manifesting it since I've been drinking green tea since I was fucking

155
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,870
19.

156
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,309
All right.

157
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,669
That's how you manifested.

158
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,379
Can I have your comb when you're finally gone?

159
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,340
Oh, that's gone in the museum somewhere.

160
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:31,940
Such like an ego.

161
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,500
That's such egomania.

162
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,139
I know.

163
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:37,899
All right.

164
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,179
If you wanted to see like the signup sheet or the museum of history of

165
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,299
entertainment history, I would bet out of all the things in that museum.

166
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:55,220
The German nine, eight, five comb in the glass gets the least amount of signups

167
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:06,059
for that part of the tour that they may, they might even have to move it to a

168
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:06,500
different room.

169
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,139
Eventually, you know, that's going to get moved three or four times before it just

170
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:10,820
gets put in storage.

171
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,100
And then I get a call asking for me to come get it.

172
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,480
All right.

173
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:28,960
You guys ready?

174
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Uh, no more Stalin.

175
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,340
I'll put the baseball on display.

176
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:40,590
Oh, they will not.

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,399
Don't you have a copy of your face?

178
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,759
Yes.

179
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:47,889
And I don't like it at all.

180
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,340
Okay.

181
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:58,230
The reason why this thing is weird is because there's constantly a mirror when

182
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,340
there is no mirror, we all know, looking in the mirror, you see your face, being

183
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:10,500
able to see your face when there is no mirror is some, I honestly, I put a towel

184
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:18,820
over it, but I don't want to see it.

185
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,299
It's weird.

186
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,340
You laugh like a gnome.

187
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,059
That's fine.

188
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:33,139
It's kind of cool.

189
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:40,620
Show it.

190
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,620
No.

191
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:43,580
I don't even have it.

192
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:44,620
I lied.

193
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,100
I don't even have it.

194
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,580
It's not even here.

195
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,320
Turn on face cam one and just have it be the mold.

196
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,879
Now that would be really funny.

197
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,580
Except the problem with that is somebody would like, would like get it and like

198
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,139
zoom in and like with AI generated fucking knowledge, it would hit every

199
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,299
single point and they'd be able to make one.

200
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,500
You can do that now.

201
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,139
Oh, nevermind.

202
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:15,539
Who cares?

203
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:30,450
You should sell it or something.

204
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,570
No, that's very weird.

205
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,029
He's obsessed with himself.

206
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,590
All right.

207
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,389
Let's go.

208
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,990
Let's go.

209
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,590
Let's go.

210
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,190
Let's go.

211
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,309
Let's go.

212
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,860
You should sell it, but attach it to a life-size stretch Armstrong.

213
00:13:59,409 --> 00:13:59,809
No.

214
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,559
Hey, speaking of things that are going on sale soon, uh, on 28th and a couple

215
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:13,860
of days, as YouTube is going up, it's not my, a mold of my face, but that,

216
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,139
that is my likeness.

217
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,259
Pretty cool.

218
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:22,100
All right.

219
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,919
Let's play bro.

220
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:24,559
Play the game.

221
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm, I'm just chilling.

222
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:38,340
Relax, bro.

223
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,139
Don't play the game.

224
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,820
I won't.

225
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:41,899
I relax.

226
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,700
I I'm not gonna.

227
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:46,539
Okay.

228
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:47,980
Uh, let's do it.

229
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,379
I'm gonna move over here.

230
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,740
You should be able to hear the game now.

231
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,750
Viewfinder.

232
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,870
If you guys remember that we played this during the demo demo, whatever

233
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:12,389
it was, the steam demo thing, whatever it was, it was fun.

234
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,909
It's a game where you take pictures and the pictures become part of

235
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,230
the world that you can place.

236
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,980
It was very fun.

237
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,080
And let's, uh, let's freaking go.

238
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:26,230
Right.

239
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:29,070
We're in time to explore.

240
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:32,659
You'll get it.

241
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,139
If you don't get it very soon here.

242
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,370
How's the audio?

243
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,769
Is it good?

244
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,090
When are you going to finish breath of the wild?

245
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,279
You know what?

246
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,720
I will.

247
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:57,830
It's not right now.

248
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,080
Is there a sprint?

249
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,519
I don't remember.

250
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,159
I don't think there is.

251
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,580
How's the audio.

252
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,059
Can you hear good?

253
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:10,690
I've seen this much overgrowth before.

254
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,500
It's okay.

255
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,779
I already, I did that before and it scared me again.

256
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,559
I guess we know now that falling doesn't hurt.

257
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,299
That's some good news.

258
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:23,820
At least.

259
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,220
Oh, that's right.

260
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,200
There's a rewind to get back up there.

261
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:33,710
That was sick.

262
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,139
Yeah.

263
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:45,659
It's a rewind time.

264
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,850
Should I say that every time?

265
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,019
What's an old photograph doing here and just hype it up for a full minute.

266
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:57,809
That's going to be so annoying.

267
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,250
If you're like a new viewer, this was like, shut the fuck up, dude.

268
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,090
And play, stop.

269
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:02,649
Just play.

270
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,250
Why do you have to do like this weird thing every time?

271
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,640
Can you do something with it?

272
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,319
Oh, that's right.

273
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:16,519
Okay.

274
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,599
I can place this over here.

275
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,640
So check this out.

276
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,359
Watch this.

277
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,299
Check this out.

278
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:21,619
You ready?

279
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,140
Did, did you just shift reality?

280
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,539
Let's go.

281
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,869
Put the phrase on a soundboard.

282
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,549
That's kind of funny.

283
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:34,789
All right.

284
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:35,069
Hold on.

285
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:38,130
What should I say?

286
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:41,819
Like rewind bros.

287
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,339
Can I get a countdown?

288
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,619
We're going into rewind.

289
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,539
Ah, I fucked it up.

290
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:45,779
Hold on.

291
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,609
Hey, I can't even do it.

292
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:49,930
Why not?

293
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,029
Why is my GoXLR fucked up?

294
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:55,670
I can't even do it.

295
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I think that, I think it's broken.

296
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,200
I can't do it.

297
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, it was funny for like five seconds.

298
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:01,819
We got it.

299
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:04,430
All right.

300
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,950
The batteries.

301
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,630
I remember the batteries.

302
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,039
Have confidence in yourself.

303
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,130
Yeah.

304
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,730
You would, when you, when you do, when you do acting, if you do voice acting,

305
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,170
you're going to do a few takes sometimes.

306
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,839
You can't get it perfect every time.

307
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,299
That just means you're a bad actor.

308
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,819
That's fine.

309
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,359
Shut up.

310
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:35,420
Oh yeah.

311
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,740
Soft retirement stream.

312
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,420
Let's go.

313
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,500
No, I'm not going to talk about that every five seconds, by the way.

314
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,450
It's almost working.

315
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:49,329
We need one more.

316
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,289
Looks like we need one more.

317
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,710
Does this mean it works if it's black and white?

318
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,410
Cool.

319
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,200
Hey, can you say hi to my cat?

320
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:06,380
Yeah.

321
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,059
Um, come here.

322
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:16,460
They work.

323
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:22,890
Hmm.

324
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:25,769
That doesn't look right.

325
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,289
Oh, you know what I'm going to have to do?

326
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,900
This is just the tutorial.

327
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,279
We're good.

328
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,180
Is it true that you're moving into a nursing home?

329
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,619
I have an, I have an idea or I, you know what?

330
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,740
No, I'm not manifesting this because it's funny.

331
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,630
Thank the jump.

332
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,009
I care.

333
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:23,880
All right.

334
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Now this is where it's going to get pretty crazy.

335
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,000
It looks like the ocean.

336
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,950
Didn't we talk about this on the hit man stream from like years ago?

337
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,589
I wish I could be like, if you threw a car battery into the ocean, like what

338
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,109
happens, you know what I mean?

339
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,349
Like we've talked about this, how much electricity needs to like

340
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,869
electrocute the water in the ocean.

341
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,589
How far does it spread?

342
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,460
Electric eels are so weird.

343
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,970
What a wild creature to have organs in their body that hold charges and then

344
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:09,490
discharge.

345
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,180
It's like two or three different organs that do different types of charging, right?

346
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,420
It's so wild.

347
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,539
It must be a security measure, a structured path we have to follow.

348
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:30,539
Well, let's find the next magic.

349
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:33,140
Yeah, I, they kind of are.

350
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,410
You know how many times I've made a joke about shooting electricity out of my

351
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:40,809
hands?

352
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:44,690
There is a creature on this earth that does that.

353
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,309
No, sit here and think about that for one second.

354
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,269
Just bear with me here.

355
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:55,150
There is a creature on earth that shoots electricity out of its body to hurt stuff.

356
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,299
Excuse me?

357
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,579
That's not a TV show.

358
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:02,619
That's a real life.

359
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:04,900
All right.

360
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,539
I got to pay attention.

361
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:05,980
Where am I going?

362
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,369
Oh, this is like a hub world.

363
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:23,849
Okay.

364
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:24,849
I get it.

365
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:34,089
Are you high?

366
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:34,529
Be honest.

367
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:34,730
No.

368
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,289
So you can revisit levels.

369
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,829
That's cool.

370
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:39,190
Okay.

371
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,180
There's another one that's going to be active.

372
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,779
I can use them.

373
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:44,740
I think.

374
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,380
How do I turn?

375
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:48,859
Oh, here we go.

376
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,190
You answered way too quickly.

377
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:57,099
Now this would be an awful game to do that with.

378
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:57,940
Are you kidding me?

379
00:22:58,819 --> 00:22:59,859
That'd be so bad.

380
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,970
Do you understand that if that were the case, I would be sitting here like this

381
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,619
for like 10 straight minutes and people would be like, what, where did he go?

382
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,140
BRB.

383
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,200
And then eventually it would just move.

384
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,319
They go, sorry.

385
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,400
I was looking at that mountain.

386
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:19,430
All right.

387
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,910
Where's this gone?

388
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,269
Oh, I need the, yep.

389
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:24,789
For the bridge.

390
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:25,349
Yep.

391
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:25,950
Go.

392
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,309
Sick.

393
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:37,890
Well well,

394
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,319
the surface you can use to climb up there.

395
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:05,529
Chicken wings.

396
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,630
Definitely high now.

397
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,400
What do I, what does it want me to do?

398
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Oh, this.

399
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,160
Yeah.

400
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:23,930

401
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,140
Cool.

402
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:42,400

415
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,700
know how many I don't know how many sleepless nights the coder it's just

416
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:17,329
like sitting there looking at the code and just going holy shit I feel like

417
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,769
after a certain point I would just be looking at this and be sitting there

418
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:24,619
going okay I'm I'm a genius at some point right like you have to give credit

419
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:30,059
where credit is due like you they need to take a lot of credit like this is

420
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,940
look at this at some point you have to sit there and like look at all you call

421
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:40,880
and go holy shit I did a great job and you absolutely deserve to say that I

422
00:28:40,880 --> 00:29:06,369
destroyed the teleporter what did I do wait what did I do that just oh oh oh

423
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:27,289
god oh my god I'm gonna puke what do I do uh what the fuck is going on that was

424
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:33,000
really weird way too dank is it too loud seems like the simulation had some

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,119
difficulty maintaining itself we might need to reroute our power sources to

426
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:45,349
keep it running that's what we get for messing with old tech genius

427
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:52,190
this tricky to get ancient tech back in working order all right

428
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:19,309
computer please load Star Trek the next generation engine room please I got

429
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:28,660
pretty good oxygen have you guys noticed this is a just as something that I've

430
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:36,579
observed I have noticed that since kovat a lot of these are still everywhere

431
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:42,509
and I keep trying to put my hand under them and they don't do anything anymore

432
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:49,700
they just don't do anything anymore I'll be like oh cool what hand sanitizer let

433
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,619
me try it there's nothing there oh oh shit there's nothing in this I think

434
00:30:54,619 --> 00:31:12,990
these have just been not filled for like a year that bad registered and I get

435
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:22,190
embarrassed every time I don't I okay I have absolutely been in a field of view

436
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,630
going from one that didn't do anything to oh there's one over there to the

437
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,029
other one that doesn't do anything either and then I kind of just put my

438
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:38,710
hands together and go like clap clap like okay um I'm gonna keep walking I'm

439
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:50,190
just gonna keep walking looks like we're back online ready when you are

440
00:31:50,190 --> 00:32:30,700
all right let's go it's too bright these panels should be like gray hold on let me

441
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:36,180
see okay but the public sanitizers smell like the cheapest vodka and have the

442
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:51,380
consistency of saliva that's yeah that's kind of true

443
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:56,690
let's get our bearings and find where we left off the foaming yeah the foaming

444
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,460
ones were awesome if you if you had a foaming hand sanitizer it was just like

445
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:15,299
like a little moose oh it was perfect it's all you needed okay so do I go back

446
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:30,210
to that other hub that I was just in because that was corrupted right yeah

447
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:43,420
there you go you're just like spongebob on spongebob was fucking awesome okay

448
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:49,529
spongebob is awesome I'm being compared to who I would determine to be a

449
00:33:49,529 --> 00:34:00,900
literal God I wouldn't be surprised if you know at the pearly gates it's

450
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:13,119

459
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:49,340
of do they're not even close somebody said I just sounded like somebody from

460
00:35:49,340 --> 00:36:10,050
from so like from like Hollywood Squares wait what now look at that this is that

461
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,539
kid this is the cool part this is the part I like the most

462
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:52,440
anything any secrets yep this was my favorite now what did I sit on my balls

463
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:03,920
or something like what are they what do I do oh shit I remember I remember this

464
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,599
one I got this is from the demo this is what sealed that I was gonna play this

465
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:16,530
game it was at this exact moment that I said yeah when this comes out I'm gonna

466
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:31,179
play it he'll say anything in his retirement whatever like that's cool

467
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:53,380
Tony said when did we enter the Nintendo DS I was reminded of watching Joel's

468
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,420
perspective during the house slipper stream that's what I was thinking of

469
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:19,670
that was a lot of fun yeah already starting to think about when house

470
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,739
slipper 2 comes out already the gears are already turning on doing that again

471
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:38,030
so should be a lot of fun second time okay this one has a battery right here

472
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:48,409
so that's easy get it right over here give them more time yeah we learned a

473
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:54,820
lot from that first one so the second one's gonna be I think a little bit

474
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:19,809
improved oh I can't like put my face on this I don't know if like this is

475
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:26,369
another like funny dumb meme then like you are gonna photocopy you like the

476
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:32,820
photo the photocopier joke I think still works even though people that

477
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,380
doesn't really exist anymore right but like I think that that joke still makes

478
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:43,250
sense it still works there's something inherently comical about like oh I'm

479
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:51,090
gonna put my face to this is squish my face down to me it's quantity to me it's

480
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:57,449
like okay more than five to ten versions of like your smooshed face I don't know

481
00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:14,900
how dangerous that is all right all right all right everybody relax what do

482
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:41,500
I need to photocopy oh definitely this I don't say photocopy too many whoa look

483
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:54,789
it's all pixelated oh guys it's just like the sunflowers oh that didn't look

484
00:40:54,789 --> 00:41:29,349
right okay so what am I actually supposed to do here wait I know that it

485
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:52,429
that's it right I have three that's kind of work right yes how did you like

486
00:41:52,429 --> 00:42:00,059
playing tf2 again it's fun I'm really surprised that that group that MVM group

487
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:09,619
did as well as we did we talked for about I want to say at least 15 minutes

488
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,019
before the stream like okay it's gonna be kind of hard this is difficult it's

489
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:38,670
really not easy yeah we destroyed it if Ludwig was going hard all right I need

490
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:52,650
some brainpower for this one no whoops should I just say wait is there any more

491
00:42:52,650 --> 00:43:09,500
pictures over here oh wait a minute I'm gonna use three because I don't know

492
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:35,500
what exactly is going on here I make this jump ah I don't need more than

493
00:43:35,500 --> 00:44:01,980
three probably let me just get them all get the get the duck oh oh this duck I

494
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:25,130
need two more ducks and I win is this water doesn't need to have a smell I

495
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,369
couldn't stop thinking about this while watching a ray attend to her plants

496
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:33,670
today there's an addictive quality to this place that makes up for the

497
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,789
inaccuracies that surround us when we come here out of thin air we create

498
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:42,230
beauty that tickles some but not all of our senses I read this as like I'm

499
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:47,900
reading sorcery strictly speaking the code we create is a technical marvel in

500
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,980
designing these structures throughs me like nothing else

501
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:57,139
averages every character in sorcery but the novelty of it makes it too easy to

502
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:04,750
forget what a real flower smells like and I don't want to forget sorcery

503
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:17,800
coming soon this coming weekend one voice yeah okay I might have one voice

504
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:22,920
but I have one version of one boy I have oh fuck never mind I'm retired who

505
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:48,239
cares where do I go um did I miss a picture oh wait up on the roof maybe

506
00:45:48,239 --> 00:46:30,409

00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:51,989
challenge can you recite the Gears of War lore mmm I can try what was the song

512
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:59,940
in the commercial it was like do do do do do do do do do do and they were

513
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,340
drilling down into the earth and they were all sitting in a pod drilling down

514
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,150
they were all sitting there and it was just drilling down down down down down

515
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,550
they had to go to the center of the earth to fight the aliens or something

516
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:31,179
that's the only thing I know about the whole game it was mad world was it it

517
00:48:31,179 --> 00:48:41,210
wasn't the that it wasn't a rock song it was mad world it didn't didn't it did

518
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:46,809
it kind of that's that kind of it go listen to what I did and imagine that

519
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:54,739
this is something you haven't thought of in ten plus years that was kind of close

520
00:48:54,739 --> 00:49:03,280
for being a memory that I haven't thought of in a very long time all right

521
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,960
so this is an optional challenge I don't know what it wants me to do but let's

522
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:24,610
find out I'm gonna put it right here here's a war to the last day this is it

523
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:35,840
this is not mad world this is it this is the one this is the right one this is

524
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:47,599
the right one yep I told you I told you I had it right it wasn't mad world

525
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,119
that's the one where they're sitting down and they're shaking in the pod and

526
00:49:53,119 --> 00:50:00,150
it's going down that's gears it that's the Gears of War 2 like trailer oh

527
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:13,760
goodness what do they think that was gonna work

528
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,420
yeah Gears of War 3 is mad world all right well knowing that that means I

529
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:38,150
have to go like this I'm smiling the average bro what about this there a

530
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:46,139
picture up there yeah there is all right I need to get obviously get up to that

531
00:50:46,139 --> 00:51:03,579
and I go from here I did there I do this that no not really oh I need to get up

532
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:17,139
there what's a maze I know what to do I know it well I already won I was gonna

533
00:51:17,139 --> 00:52:03,980
say I'll just look at it from above okay now oh shoot oh crap you're cheating

534
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:08,539
there's no such thing as cheating in a game like this it's called using

535
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:20,219
different parts of your brain to solve different problems all right this needs

536
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:31,070
to be much closer I have the right idea this needs to be like over here from the

537
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:55,559
table that that should do it right yes it will do these mashed potatoes have

538
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,380
been going a while I'm getting worried what are you just stirring mashed

539
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:25,659
potatoes oh wait doesn't seem right this is not right oh how do I need to

540
00:53:25,659 --> 00:53:29,760
rotate it okay but if I rewind is that gonna I'm gonna lose all my am I to lose

541
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:56,329
progress if I rewind hold on what is on this one did I oh shit okay wait ah I I

542
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:15,050
what the hell is happening what's the goal is there like a their goal I don't

543
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:34,889
know what the goal is is I don't see a teleporter anywhere up there wait a

544
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:55,360
minute I don't get it I missed a photo okay how do I wait hold on I have an

545
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:17,760
idea is that the one where's the one that I need to get right there I this is

546
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:37,250
a challenge mode this is not our where do the stairs go I just think I might

547
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:48,119
have gotten it it's right there can I crouch shit it's right here hold on I'll

548
00:55:48,119 --> 00:56:38,800
get it this is gonna be puke wait what's that I got it I actually just got it I

549
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:56,159
think I can't climb these stairs why what are you talking about what get up

550
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:16,199
the stairs what what was wrong with that jump backwards all right this is an

551
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,800
optional hard mode that's why I'm gonna puke if I stay here for more than like

552
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:43,650
10 more minutes why can't I go up these stairs do it again just stop where do I

553
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:55,059
need to go do I have to go up there if I have to go up there then I mean I have

554
00:57:55,059 --> 00:58:09,949
to have to go this way which gives me this picture which then let's go over

555
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:14,219
here there's this photo and I need to get each one of these so let me get this

556
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:23,860
photo we bring it back here so what if I go like this now I'm just here I just

557
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,940
wanna see what happens so if I get this this brings me here this gives me

558
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:41,880
another one of these which gives me another one of these which gives me this

559
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:57,739
which then allows me to I don't know I mean is this bait is this picture is

560
00:58:57,739 --> 00:59:05,809
bait this has to be what if I go like this and just keep picking up the same

561
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:52,409
picture just over and over again I just don't I just don't get it am I am I

562
00:59:52,409 --> 01:00:08,360
supposed to eventually make it up to the top of here does this do anything for me

563
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:53,829
which photo is the teleporter in I didn't I thought okay I thought that I

564
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:58,510
was look I didn't have the right context I thought I was trying to get up on top

565
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:03,869
of the other buildings that's what I had to do in the last couple times I only

566
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:19,949
did one more duck and I can take a bath all right so that went over here

567
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:32,090

at work thought provoking go there a painting how to use our screen printing

602
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:42,260
in mural successes your little orchids urine dream big but remain practical

603
01:08:42,260 --> 01:09:00,819
strawberries are pretty good something I've been noticing this is a that's

604
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:06,310
gonna make me throw up looking at that all right my graphics card when the fan

605
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:23,590
turns on now kind of goes like this I think I'm gonna have to replace it oh

606
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:38,779
oh but it's not it's not that the fans loud it's making a different noise did

607
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:42,260
you okay when it would when the thing when the fan would boot up we all know

608
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:52,220
you that's fine the pitch has changed instead of it goes what does a pitch

609
01:09:52,260 --> 01:10:06,569
change mean bearings might be cooked hmm it's not dirty I usually I usually dust

610
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:23,060
it out there's a change when the FPS changes oh it's only when I think that

611
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:43,260
it starts to heat up a little it's gonna do a sick drift stare at a wall no it

612
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,579
doesn't I know I know you were you talking about where if you look at a

613
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:53,560
certain thing or if a certain thing it's rendered it's like yeah I know I've

614
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:01,180
heard that I know that this is the fan kicking on yeah this is more like a fan

615
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:29,800
sound but okay let's see use camera okay I turn this I like does that help me at

616
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:37,140
all I'm assuming probably no but I'm gonna just see what happens now I can

617
01:11:37,140 --> 01:12:10,000
rotate the photo what am I doing uh let me take a look around first why would

618
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:18,609
you need two photos if it's just right here excellent show you had coffee yet

619
01:12:18,609 --> 01:12:32,170
yeah I'm just showing all right two batteries there are four photos I can

620
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:43,600
take here just just take them right I'm just gonna let's just see what's the

621
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:51,489
cat's name oh I don't know all right battery right there let's go like this

622
01:12:51,489 --> 01:13:30,569
name the cat I don't know Joey that has a name it's Kate that's right yeah I was

623
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:35,369
not paying attention I was half my brain was and then it just buried it

624
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:51,029
somewhere all right one more we're probably up there

625
01:13:51,029 --> 01:14:09,890
but I have a solution to this I hate this mess of my own making. You must know what Mira has been working on, squirreled away in her own little maze, so I can find a way to help her.

626
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:16,399
Mending relationships often felt harder for her I have been tending to her plans

627
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,560
I wonder why she didn't just put in the effort oh I think I just got her hold on

628
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:51,630
sorry all right I'm gonna go back here this is on the battery oh shit there it

629
01:14:51,630 --> 01:15:16,510
is it's right there is that it is that not it I want a good bird's-eye view

630
01:15:16,510 --> 01:16:24,939
okay where where is it it's not up there okay so is this one right here where is

631
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:31,020
the other battery I would imagine to be like around the corner right here but no

632
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:49,250
or up top on one of these but it's not where's the other battery huh I have an

633
01:16:49,250 --> 01:17:12,979
idea oh I know what to do I know what to do there we go

634
01:17:12,979 --> 01:17:31,250
nope oh I figured it out I got it I got it I got it everybody everybody chill

635
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:47,770
everybody chill how do you feel when all your fans can immediately know that

636
01:17:47,770 --> 01:18:07,130
you are high well you're not very good at it because I'm not no I told you

637
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:13,340
since the analog clock I incident I have not been able to do that no I said I'm

638
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:36,050
never doing that ever again since the analog clock incident you also admitted

639
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:50,109
the analog clock thing was a lie to save face if it that was a lie no no no no

640
01:18:50,109 --> 01:18:57,510
the cement level in hitman was the lie to save face you're mixing it up but we

641
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:01,180
have to make sure we get the record straight the cement level in hitman 3

642
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:18,600
was the lie to save face come on you gotta get it right what is this yeah I

643
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,560
think I distinctly remember looking over at chat at being like oh my god dude no

676
01:30:38,510 --> 01:31:00,100
undeal the telephone hey I've been trying to look ahead but the simulation

677
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:04,699
is a bit of a maze you're the only one that can navigate it simulation is a

678
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:09,659
maze what remains of all their research should be scattered around you this is

679
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:13,340
gonna be a hard one machine that could solve climate change I'd be deep in a

680
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:18,340
lab somewhere anyway I'll do my best out here find that machine all right I'm

681
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:23,770
cheering you on find the machine delicate machine something to do with

682
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:33,510
climate that sounds familiar you got it Joey all right this is gonna spawn that

686
01:32:51,090 --> 01:32:57,229
what to do watch this hey that's mine I can say like that I didn't even need to

687
01:32:57,229 --> 01:32:59,770
I had it I didn't even eat I didn't even need you that I didn't even need to do

688
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:02,810
that that was I got it I got it I got it I got it again I know to do is watch

689
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:12,659
watch this I did it backwards wait wait everybody just I know what to do I'm

690
01:33:12,659 --> 01:33:14,880
I'm just doing it in the wrong order.

691
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,840
Okay, just get me in here.

692
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,119
Start over, watch.

693
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:27,810
I need to take a picture of this while it is intact.

694
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:32,430
There we go.

695
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:35,630
And then, now, it doesn't matter.

696
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:36,510
I got it, yeah.

697
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:43,409
That was a tricky one, but it was fun.

698
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,449
Now, ooh, but hold on.

699
01:33:45,449 --> 01:33:49,319
This is where it gets a little weird.

700
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:53,729
Okay, hold on.

701
01:33:53,729 --> 01:33:58,260
Okay, wait.

702
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:21,329
Take another picture.

703
01:34:21,329 --> 01:34:31,659
Now, here we go.

704
01:34:31,659 --> 01:34:43,560
You have to take one before and then one after.

705
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,720
Oh, okay, I bit it.

706
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:49,770
But this is the optional challenge now.

707
01:34:49,770 --> 01:34:51,689
These are gonna get progressively harder and harder,

708
01:34:51,689 --> 01:34:52,529
and I'm gonna tell you,

709
01:34:52,529 --> 01:34:54,649
I don't think I'm gonna do all the optional challenges.

710
01:34:54,649 --> 01:34:57,069
I'm gonna try them for five minutes each.

711
01:34:57,069 --> 01:35:10,329
Start the timer starting now.

712
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:13,739
Complete them, you wimp.

713
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:14,579
They're hard.

714
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:20,279
All right, so what's going on here?

715
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:21,119
I was gonna take a picture of it,

716
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,909
because I don't know.

717
01:35:24,909 --> 01:35:26,930
I imagine I could probably use this

718
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,189
as a platform to jump on.

719
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:32,029
What's the goal?

720
01:35:32,029 --> 01:35:33,989
Let's find the goal.

721
01:35:33,989 --> 01:35:39,189
The goal is to flip this thing sideways.

722
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,899
I got it, I've already got it.

723
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:01,939
You better start betting,

724
01:36:01,939 --> 01:36:03,960
because I got it right now.

725
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,520
You better bet correctly,

726
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,800
because I just beat it.

727
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,039
Hopefully, you got 10 seconds to get the bet right,

728
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:31,359
because I just did it.

729
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:32,920
I know what I gotta do,

730
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:36,020
but I don't know how to get up there.

731
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:42,880
Wait, hold on.

732
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,720
Check this out.

733
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,390
Watch this.

734
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:51,300
It's the lowest point.

735
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,539
I need to see where it is.

736
01:36:52,539 --> 01:36:54,560
It is, which side is it on?

737
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,399
All right, it's on this side.

738
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:57,239
So it's like,

739
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,609
I know what I have to do.

740
01:37:04,609 --> 01:37:05,609
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

741
01:37:05,609 --> 01:37:06,449
I got it, I got it.

742
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,880
Come on, I got it.

743
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,520
Is that it?

744
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:32,819
Fuck, you know I'm gonna get it right now.

745
01:37:32,819 --> 01:37:42,279
It's so close.

746
01:37:42,279 --> 01:37:43,680
Got it.

747
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,319
Oh, sorry, doubters.

748
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:47,880
You just absolutely got destroyed right there.

749
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:50,359
I mean, just decimated.

750
01:37:50,359 --> 01:37:58,970
I kind of feel bad for the doubters, don't you?

751
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,810
I kind of feel bad for the doubters.

752
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:04,470
The first time ever.

753
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,069
Usually, I'm internally swearing at them,

754
01:38:06,069 --> 01:38:10,699
but not right now.

755
01:38:10,699 --> 01:38:12,300
We're heading towards the workspace

756
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,869
of a masterful engineer.

757
01:38:14,869 --> 01:38:16,909
See, Leon, much like the others,

758
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:19,520
settled in quickly here.

759
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,720
I got that one.

760
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,560
I caught that one.

761
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,359
I caught on pretty quickly on that one.

762
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:26,199
Oh, hold on.

763
01:38:26,199 --> 01:38:27,039
Okay, there we go.

764
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:38,020
It's okay, the points don't matter since he's retired.

765
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm sure you'll find something useful here.

766
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,420
I always believed in you.

767
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:44,739
Well, thanks, Joe.

768
01:38:44,739 --> 01:38:45,579
Really important, Jerma.

769
01:38:45,579 --> 01:38:58,399
What is your sleep positioning?

770
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,479
I am a side sleeper, usually.

771
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:03,319
Usually.

772
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:12,880
I got the, usually I'm on my right side,

773
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:18,239
and I've got a good pillow to support my arm and shoulder,

774
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:19,840
like my arm and forearm,

775
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,359
and I'm like right at the bicep meeting the forearm area,

776
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:25,399
is under the pillow,

777
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:28,000
and I'm kind of propped up right side, lying that way.

778
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
My legs are sort of down on the, you know what I mean?

779
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,239
I feel like most people sleep like that.

780
01:39:33,239 --> 01:39:38,159
That's probably a majority.

781
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:39,000
Filter select.

782
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:48,350
Do you sleep hanging from the ceiling like a bat?

783
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:54,800
Do you sleep hanging from the ceiling like a bat?

784
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:07,159
That would be really weird.

785
01:40:07,159 --> 01:40:08,989
What does this say?

786
01:40:08,989 --> 01:40:15,359
Information?

787
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:20,359
Dude, you guys have no idea.

788
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:24,829
It's gonna be, I, okay.

789
01:40:24,829 --> 01:40:28,600
I'm going to commit to one bit this year,

790
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,399
and it's gonna be a good one.

791
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:36,189
I promise.

792
01:40:36,189 --> 01:40:37,470
It's not a big bit.

793
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:44,300
It's just a small bit, but I'm gonna commit to it.

794
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,220
Pauly and I were laughing a lot about this,

795
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:52,479
and it's, it just, it has to be done.

796
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:54,430
It must be done.

797
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:59,710
Where's the level?

798
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:06,670
They're all staticky.

799
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:12,319
Don't say, I won't say, I won't say.

800
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:13,199
Will it be on YouTube or?

801
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:16,109
No, it'll be stream.

802
01:41:16,109 --> 01:41:19,359
Probably just easier that way.

803
01:41:19,359 --> 01:41:28,170
How do I unlock these?

804
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:35,569
Uh, excuse me?

805
01:41:35,569 --> 01:41:42,270
Is there higher up that I didn't see?

806
01:41:42,270 --> 01:41:43,630
It's gonna be really hard not to laugh,

807
01:41:43,630 --> 01:41:46,510
but I will go into actor mode,

808
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:56,760
and I promise you, I will see the bit through.

809
01:41:56,760 --> 01:42:02,649
By the train.

810
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:09,039
Right in front of the train?

811
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:16,229
Yeah, okay.

812
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:19,579
Ooh, I love the teal.

813
01:42:19,579 --> 01:42:23,779
It's my favorite color.

814
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:26,279
Did you guess?

815
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:37,180
My entire channel is based around like these three colors.

816
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:40,720
Do you hear that?

817
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,189
Freeze.

818
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:46,310
Oh, another one of these.

819
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:47,149
Oh, all the levers.

820
01:42:47,149 --> 01:42:47,989
What are we looking for?

821
01:42:47,989 --> 01:42:53,560
All right, mountain.

822
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:59,710
Okay, need to watch this.

823
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:01,510
I was hoping I could just do a weird hop around it.

824
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:10,229
I probably can.

825
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:11,390
That's pretty close.

826
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:19,720
It's definitely doable.

827
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:20,920
Someone else will do it.

828
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:27,770
I know you will.

829
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:31,689
Don't hold W while you air strafe.

830
01:43:31,689 --> 01:43:33,609
I feel like that was screamed at me

831
01:43:33,609 --> 01:43:35,930
so many times over the years,

832
01:43:35,930 --> 01:43:38,890
and I just never was able to not do it.

833
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:51,569
Just always press W.

834
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:52,489
You're just so conditioned

835
01:43:52,489 --> 01:44:09,199
to be holding the move forward button.

836
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:18,590
I don't see a picture anywhere.

837
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:19,789
Jerma, I'm a dumb animal.

838
01:44:19,789 --> 01:44:40,689
If I can let go of W, you can too.

839
01:44:40,689 --> 01:44:43,689
I'm not even sure that's a possible physics ability

840
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:45,600
you can even do in this game.

841
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:51,590
I did let go of W though, I promise.

842
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:53,840
Okay, well, there's the teleporter.

843
01:44:53,840 --> 01:45:11,859
Hey, look at that.

844
01:45:11,859 --> 01:45:14,159
Air strafe is a Source thing.

845
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:19,520
Yeah.

846
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,880
All right, so very clearly,

847
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,310
I, oh, I thought I had to get four.

848
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:25,270
One, two, three.

849
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:33,340
Ah.

850
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:34,340
Well done.

851
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:35,180
Thanks.

852
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:42,470
It's a shame things crumbled.

853
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:44,890
Cake.

854
01:45:44,890 --> 01:45:53,750
I don't like cake.

855
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:58,399
Can we get a poll?

856
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:00,439
I actually, and please answer honestly.

857
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:01,720
I know sometimes people mess around here,

858
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:06,170
but standard cake.

859
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:08,579
A standard birthday cake.

860
01:46:08,579 --> 01:46:10,140
No, not ice cream cake.

861
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:11,699
Not a tiramisu.

862
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:14,760
Just a cake.

863
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,479
Just a regular cake.

864
01:46:17,479 --> 01:46:22,479
Do you rate that higher than a C plus?

865
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,039
Is standard cake higher than a C plus?

866
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:27,449
Yes or no?

867
01:46:27,449 --> 01:46:39,520
Because I am somebody that says no.

868
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:49,300
I'm very curious where everybody stands on this, honestly.

869
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,739
It's a very standard C.

870
01:46:50,739 --> 01:46:53,359
That's what I mean.

871
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:57,829
I do wonder how many people see cake as higher than C plus.

872
01:46:58,069 --> 01:47:00,229
I feel like it's probably a lot of people.

873
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,640
I thought that was a burger.

874
01:47:26,939 --> 01:47:27,979
Okay.

875
01:47:27,979 --> 01:47:31,359
So I'm gonna guess that I have to take a picture

876
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:32,840
of this with the poster.

877
01:47:37,289 --> 01:47:38,130
Oh.

878
01:47:46,529 --> 01:47:49,289
I can't wait to see how you use this.

879
01:47:49,289 --> 01:47:50,130
I use it myself.

880
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,050
Wow.

881
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:53,489
58% higher than a C plus.

882
01:47:53,489 --> 01:47:57,579
Wow.

883
01:47:57,579 --> 01:48:01,859
That's actually really surprising.

884
01:48:01,859 --> 01:48:15,260
Okay.

885
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,100
I would say it's a C plus.

886
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:19,239
Maybe a C.

887
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:24,550
Some, but some cake is terrible.

888
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:25,630
I have never, okay.

889
01:48:25,630 --> 01:48:30,159
Ice cream is always gonna be an A.

890
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:33,079
Because even like bad ice cream, it's ice cream.

891
01:48:33,079 --> 01:48:34,640
It's just, it doesn't matter what ice cream it is.

892
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:35,479
It's gonna be fine.

893
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,640
Okay.

894
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:38,359
What are my options at the dessert?

895
01:48:38,359 --> 01:48:40,399
It's cake is, okay.

896
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:42,560
There's vanilla ice cream on the table over there.

897
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,840
There's cookies.

898
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,479
That ice cream is always gonna be perfect.

899
01:48:45,479 --> 01:48:47,479
I'm always gonna be okay with that.

900
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:49,960
But I've had a lot of cakes before that were bad.

901
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,880
That were way less than a C.

902
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:59,869
Grayscale, cold, warm.

903
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:00,710
Whoa.

904
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:01,630
This is really weird.

905
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:07,199
I'm gonna do this for one second.

906
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:17,609
Game boy.

907
01:49:17,609 --> 01:49:21,449
Did I even activate it?

908
01:49:21,449 --> 01:49:23,170
What are these bad cakes?

909
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:26,579
Dry as heck.

910
01:49:26,579 --> 01:49:28,539
I have eaten cakes before that were super moist.

911
01:49:28,539 --> 01:49:29,939
And okay, this is higher than a C plus.

912
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:30,859
This is all right.

913
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:32,420
This might be close.

914
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:34,300
But I've had cake before that.

915
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:35,859
I feel like I'm eating sawdust.

916
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,319
Oh, all right.

917
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:54,119
I kind of don't want to do this anymore.

918
01:49:54,119 --> 01:49:54,960
Do you know what I mean?

919
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,000
I don't know if I like this filter.

920
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:02,840
Now I understand what it was for.

921
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:09,399
I can't even read the instructions.

922
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:25,800
Yeah, we are going to change this.

923
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,239
What is better on average?

924
01:50:27,239 --> 01:50:28,640
What were the other options?

925
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:30,670
Cake over pie?

926
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:31,510
Huh?

927
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:34,899
Cake over pie?

928
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:37,899
What are you talking about?

929
01:50:37,899 --> 01:50:44,149
No, no way.

930
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:49,149
Over like a banana cream pie or a chocolate cream pie.

931
01:50:50,199 --> 01:50:52,699
I thought that apple pie,

932
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:59,399
I thought you guys were apple pie Andes.

933
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:22,069
All right, I can't even look at that.

934
01:51:22,069 --> 01:51:22,909
Apple pie.

935
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:25,109
I don't even like apple pie.

936
01:51:25,109 --> 01:51:28,060
Oh, a lot of people just heard that

937
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:34,619
for the first time, I think.

938
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:36,100
A lot of people may have just heard that

939
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,399
for the first time.

940
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:46,430
I want them to be closer.

941
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:48,390
Okay, well, did I just do it?

942
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:49,510
I just beat it.

943
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:54,859
Oh, okay, let me explain.

944
01:51:54,859 --> 01:51:57,220
Let me explain.

945
01:51:57,220 --> 01:52:00,260
Everybody that's saying, what the fuck?

946
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:04,659
If apple pie just had the sludge in it

947
01:52:04,659 --> 01:52:09,020
and not the apple pieces, the apple slices,

948
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,020
if it was just the pie crust,

949
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:14,859
the sludge filling and no apple slices,

950
01:52:14,859 --> 01:52:18,380
I would love it.

951
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:19,779
You take the apple slices out

952
01:52:19,779 --> 01:52:25,800
and that would be one of my favorite pies.

953
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,560
That's fucked up.

954
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,399
That's fine.

955
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:32,199
But that sweet apple flavor is great.

956
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:35,680
I just don't like the warm, hot, slimy, slippery,

957
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,479
like apple, no, no, no, no, no.

958
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:39,880
It's just, I don't like it.

959
01:52:55,420 --> 01:53:07,359
I'm getting achievements for doing this.

960
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:15,710
No bully.

961
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:18,109
NA has the worst cuisine.

962
01:53:20,119 --> 01:53:20,960
What does that have?

963
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,079
That has nothing to do with,

964
01:53:22,119 --> 01:53:23,920
I'm sorry, but banana cream, where is banana?

965
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,739
Where did banana cream pie originate from?

966
01:53:27,739 --> 01:53:30,579
Because American desserts, hold on.

967
01:53:30,579 --> 01:53:32,739
Hold the phone for a second.

968
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:41,689
American desserts are ridiculous.

969
01:53:41,770 --> 01:53:42,609
Where did banana cream,

970
01:53:42,609 --> 01:53:44,489
who made the first banana cream pie?

971
01:53:44,489 --> 01:53:45,609
Coconut cream pie?

972
01:53:45,609 --> 01:53:48,779
Are you serious?

973
01:53:48,779 --> 01:53:49,779
What about donuts?

974
01:53:49,779 --> 01:53:52,899
Who made the first donut?

975
01:53:52,899 --> 01:53:55,180
Eh, it's probably like German or something.

976
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:56,619
Banana cream pie though, where did it come from?

977
01:53:56,619 --> 01:53:57,460
Look it up.

978
01:53:57,460 --> 01:54:01,659
Pecan pie, look it up.

979
01:54:01,819 --> 01:54:04,460
Excuse me, cotton candy ice cream, look it up.

980
01:54:06,970 --> 01:54:09,960
I'm just kidding.

981
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:11,199
American desserts suck.

982
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:12,319
No, they don't.

983
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:14,039
It's like one of the things that Americans make

984
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:28,399
that are very good.

985
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:37,479
Americans make fantastic desserts.

986
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:38,560
Barbecue?

987
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,079
Yeah, excuse me.

988
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:41,279
I don't want to hear that.

989
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:44,520
Look, I know like Americans, hey, LLM.

990
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,779
I got a nice smoked brisket.

991
01:54:47,779 --> 01:54:51,029
Come on, Gwen.

992
01:54:51,029 --> 01:55:00,260
I do not want to hear that.

993
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,460
Do Oreos count?

994
01:55:09,010 --> 01:55:11,930
I want to say yes, but I can't

995
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:15,609
because weren't they something else like a long time?

996
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:18,050
Wasn't there like a whole thing about Oreos

997
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:18,890
and what are they called?

998
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:22,289
Hydrox, is there something?

999
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,199
Was Hydrox American?

1000
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:30,579
I think it was.

1001
01:55:30,579 --> 01:55:33,100
But do other countries have cereals with mascots?

1002
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:33,939
Checkmate.

1003
01:55:33,939 --> 01:55:38,630
That's right.

1004
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:39,789
Yeah, sorry.

1005
01:55:39,789 --> 01:55:42,130
Tony the Tiger.

1006
01:55:42,130 --> 01:55:48,359
Tony the Tiger, it's American, okay?

1007
01:55:48,359 --> 01:55:49,239
Yeah, they do.

1008
01:55:49,239 --> 01:55:50,079
Yeah, they do.

1009
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:51,399
Oh, all right.

1010
01:55:51,399 --> 01:55:52,479
You want to have a cage match

1011
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:54,680
between Tony the Tiger, Count Chocula

1012
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:58,640
and that fucking wacky Cocoa Puffs bird

1013
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:01,199
against whatever the fuck you're going to bring to the table?

1014
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:10,960
What's going to get in there in the cage match?

1015
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,359
Wait, were they fighting?

1016
01:56:12,359 --> 01:56:13,399
I forget.

1017
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:21,439
I think they were fighting, weren't they?

1018
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:22,279
I don't know.

1019
01:56:22,279 --> 01:56:24,279
I've never really thought that much about cereal mascots.

1020
01:56:24,279 --> 01:56:26,159
He's patriotic for cereal.

1021
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:48,640
Of course I am because they are great.

1022
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:52,010
I'm available.

1023
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:59,199
All right, what am I doing?

1024
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:02,920
Yeah, Captain Crunch.

1025
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:06,359
You go, yeah, my cereal mascot from, I don't know,

1026
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:08,739
wherever, from England,

1027
01:57:08,739 --> 01:57:12,220
my cereal mascot will beat your cereal mascot's ass.

1028
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,479
Oh yeah?

1029
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:17,680
Captain Crunch will launch a fucking Crunchberry Cannonball

1030
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,789
out of his ship at you, all right?

1031
01:57:21,789 --> 01:57:23,869
You want to sail the seas against Captain Crunch?

1032
01:57:23,869 --> 01:57:26,189
Bring it.

1033
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:27,109
Why do I care about this?

1034
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:38,250
All right, I need to play the game.

1035
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,010
Play the game, nobody cares.

1036
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:42,170
Oh, I think a lot of people care,

1037
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:48,159
judging by the amount of scathing reviews I'm getting.

1038
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:56,500
All right, so I got to get that.

1039
01:57:56,500 --> 01:58:07,810
Let's get a picture of that first.

1040
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:12,750
Well, that was way easier than I was making it.

1041
01:58:12,750 --> 01:58:13,789
You still eat Oreos?

1042
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:21,239
I'd say maybe sometimes.

1043
01:58:21,239 --> 01:58:25,069
Whoa, what's this?

1044
01:58:25,069 --> 01:58:27,680
That's kind of cool.

1045
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:33,579
What about the Honey Nut Cheerios Bee?

1046
01:58:33,579 --> 01:58:38,560
What's your number one snack right now?

1047
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:39,399
I don't know if I could say,

1048
01:58:39,399 --> 01:58:41,439
it really does vary depending on the mood.

1049
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:46,960
Celia always fond of games.

1050
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:47,800
Can I play this?

1051
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:02,779
Honestly, if you want the real answer,

1052
01:59:02,779 --> 01:59:05,460
it's probably hummus.

1053
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,659
I could eat hummus all day, every single day.

1054
01:59:07,659 --> 01:59:11,119
And I probably have always one of the first things

1055
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:11,960
that I get at the grocery store.

1056
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,279
Did you nick my biscuit?

1057
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:16,239
Love it so much, it's like the best thing in the world.

1058
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:18,819
What sort of accusation is that?

1059
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:21,420
Did, didn't you?

1060
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,819
I can always ask Kate, you know.

1061
01:59:22,819 --> 01:59:25,140
Oh, right, so what if I did?

1062
01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:26,819
I was just sitting there going uneaten.

1063
01:59:26,819 --> 01:59:29,140
It's not as if it could have gone cold.

1064
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:30,779
Hummus with a little bit of bread.

1065
01:59:31,779 --> 01:59:34,340
Kate, can you please run shortbread for PXE

1066
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:35,819
for our esteemed colleague.

1067
01:59:35,819 --> 01:59:36,659
Non-bread.

1068
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,619
Chickpeas are so good.

1069
01:59:41,079 --> 01:59:43,960
What am I supposed to, am I supposed to go in?

1070
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,039
Wait, I'm not actually supposed to walk.

1071
01:59:46,039 --> 01:59:46,880
I am.

1072
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:48,520
Okay, hold on.

1073
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:54,739
Wait a minute.

1074
01:59:54,739 --> 01:59:57,020
Wait, this is really cool, hold on.

1075
01:59:57,020 --> 02:00:07,930
I gotta jump down on it.

1076
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:15,319
That makes sense, doesn't it?

1077
02:00:15,319 --> 02:00:21,850
Oh, that makes so much sense.

1078
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:30,590
Come on, get in there.

1079
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:48,029
Yes, it's something like that, right?

1080
02:00:48,029 --> 02:00:51,130
Oh, wait, what's this?

1081
02:00:51,130 --> 02:00:55,600
Am I overthinking this like crazy or what?

1082
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,880
I'm overthinking this one?

1083
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,579
Okay.

1084
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:11,180
Hang on.

1085
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:12,020
Oh.

1086
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:12,859
Did that sink?

1087
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:13,699
You make my biscuit.

1088
02:01:13,699 --> 02:01:14,539
Me?

1089
02:01:14,539 --> 02:01:15,380
What goes on?

1090
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:16,220
I steal your biscuit.

1091
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:17,060
Must they flip?

1092
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,380
What sort of accusation is that?

1093
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:21,619
You did, didn't you?

1094
02:01:21,619 --> 02:01:22,979
I can always ask Kate, you know.

1095
02:01:22,979 --> 02:01:23,819
I don't get it.

1096
02:01:23,819 --> 02:01:25,300
Oh, right, so what if I did?

1097
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:27,020
I was just sitting there going uneaten.

1098
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:29,100
It's not as if it could have gone cold.

1099
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:30,899
Well, if you're gonna kick up a fuss.

1100
02:01:30,899 --> 02:01:31,739
Oh, I get it.

1101
02:01:31,739 --> 02:01:32,579
I fall into it.

1102
02:01:32,579 --> 02:01:34,539
Maybe please run short my Doki XC

1103
02:01:34,539 --> 02:01:36,100
for our esteemed colleague here.

1104
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:37,979
I get it.

1105
02:01:37,979 --> 02:01:45,960
Biscuit thief.

1106
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:53,350
I don't get it.

1107
02:01:53,350 --> 02:02:19,479
What am I trying to do here?

1108
02:02:19,479 --> 02:02:22,840
What was the, why was this cool thing here?

1109
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:26,880
What?

1110
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:31,369
Is this just a cool thing?

1111
02:02:31,369 --> 02:02:42,600
Well, okay.

1112
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:49,909
All right, where's the batteries?

1113
02:02:49,909 --> 02:02:51,600
I did this one in the demo,

1114
02:02:51,600 --> 02:03:04,930
so I should get it pretty quickly.

1115
02:03:04,930 --> 02:03:05,770
It's two, right?

1116
02:03:05,770 --> 02:03:06,609
Yep.

1117
02:03:06,609 --> 02:03:09,829
Okay, and then I need to take a picture of this,

1118
02:03:09,829 --> 02:03:12,850
put it this way,

1119
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:16,529
because then, aha.

1120
02:03:16,529 --> 02:03:17,850
I pre-played this level.

1121
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:33,670
I did it in the demo.

1122
02:03:33,670 --> 02:03:34,510
What about on this table?

1123
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:37,729
Something to pick up?

1124
02:03:37,729 --> 02:03:39,489
Everything keeps breaking.

1125
02:03:39,489 --> 02:03:40,529
You think in a simulation,

1126
02:03:40,529 --> 02:03:42,130
everything will find a way to maintain itself,

1127
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:43,810
but no.

1128
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:44,649
Change the filter?

1129
02:03:44,649 --> 02:03:46,130
Yeah, I have to wait till the next level.

1130
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:47,170
Keeps me busy.

1131
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:48,789
Some piece.

1132
02:03:48,789 --> 02:03:50,430
I could have done it, like dropped out,

1133
02:03:50,430 --> 02:03:51,949
but I would have probably had to do all these levels.

1134
02:03:51,949 --> 02:03:55,909
What is that?

1135
02:03:55,909 --> 02:03:57,619
This is Tetris.

1136
02:03:57,619 --> 02:04:01,210
Does it actually play?

1137
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:04,010
Ooh, yeah, it definitely does.

1138
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:04,850
All right, so hold on.

1139
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:29,949
How do I do this?

1140
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:32,149
Dude, all right, I can get this.

1141
02:04:32,149 --> 02:04:41,789
Wait a second.

1142
02:04:41,789 --> 02:04:47,920
Can I?

1143
02:04:47,920 --> 02:05:06,479
Maybe not.

1144
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:07,960
Shit, all of it was gone.

1145
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:09,359
Whatever.

1146
02:05:09,359 --> 02:05:11,560
This is cool, but somebody else can figure this out.

1147
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:12,439
It's a fun little thing.

1148
02:05:12,439 --> 02:05:26,510
What's this one?

1149
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:27,350
I'm right here.

1150
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:38,729
Give it to me.

1151
02:05:38,729 --> 02:05:53,890
Holy shit.

1152
02:05:53,890 --> 02:06:08,270
Can I go all the way up?

1153
02:06:08,270 --> 02:06:09,699
All right, I did it.

1154
02:06:09,699 --> 02:06:16,479
That's fun.

1155
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,960
Those will stack infinitely.

1156
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:35,930
They will?

1157
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:36,770
Oh, shit.

1158
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:39,090
I found something else fun to do.

1159
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:45,800
Hold on.

1160
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:50,590
I don't care about the level right now.

1161
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:57,159
Like, I just want to do five of those.

1162
02:06:57,159 --> 02:06:58,119
Where was that thing?

1163
02:06:58,119 --> 02:06:59,119
Yeah, I'm gonna get a picture

1164
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:03,399
of like three or four at the same time.

1165
02:07:03,399 --> 02:07:11,600
So technically if I go like this

1166
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:12,640
and then like that,

1167
02:07:57,369 --> 02:08:20,829
it's gotta get one and I'm good.

1168
02:08:20,829 --> 02:08:28,079
Oh, shit.

1169
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:39,399
All right, I gotta take my time.

1170
02:08:50,319 --> 02:08:53,079
I don't even care about the teleporter.

1171
02:08:53,079 --> 02:08:54,699
And I'll go back because I can,

1172
02:08:54,699 --> 02:08:56,020
let's go like this.

1173
02:08:56,020 --> 02:09:02,350
That's better.

1174
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:16,359
Goodness.

1175
02:09:16,359 --> 02:09:17,760
This guy sucks.

1176
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:28,239
No, it's kind of hard to get these.

1177
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:43,989
Oh my God.

1178
02:09:43,989 --> 02:09:54,029
Uh-oh.

1179
02:09:54,029 --> 02:09:54,869
No!

1180
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:20,970
Go, ah, wait.

1181
02:10:20,970 --> 02:10:29,920
Oh, fuck off.

1182
02:11:05,659 --> 02:11:17,109
Shit.

1183
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:17,949
I want to restart

1184
02:11:17,949 --> 02:11:21,470
because I have a better idea.

1185
02:11:21,470 --> 02:11:25,850
I'm gonna put them closer together.

1186
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:26,770
I want to get them all.

1187
02:11:26,770 --> 02:11:27,689
This is gonna be so stupid,

1188
02:11:27,689 --> 02:11:28,529
but I don't care.

1189
02:11:28,529 --> 02:11:30,250
It's fun.

1190
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:32,899
All right, so here's the plan.

1191
02:11:32,899 --> 02:11:34,420
Plan is put this in a spot

1192
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:36,220
where I can get to it easily,

1193
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,779
like down.

1194
02:11:37,779 --> 02:11:42,720
Okay, here we go.

1195
02:11:42,720 --> 02:12:35,329
Now, I'm not stuck.

1196
02:12:35,329 --> 02:12:49,699
I'm doing something weird.

1197
02:12:49,699 --> 02:13:14,829
No, no, no, no, no.

1198
02:13:14,829 --> 02:13:15,789
God damn it.

1199
02:13:38,590 --> 02:13:39,670
Oh, yep.

1200
02:13:39,670 --> 02:14:03,720
Here it is.

1201
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:06,960
Absolutely perfect.

1202
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:08,600
Now, I can fall down and get these stones.

1203
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,539
Do it like an idiot.

1204
02:14:11,539 --> 02:14:19,550
I lucked out so bad right there.

1205
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:21,039
Okay, it's time.

1206
02:14:21,039 --> 02:14:41,260
I got them all.

1207
02:14:41,260 --> 02:14:42,100
Stop doing that.

1208
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:42,979
I have to go straight up.

1209
02:14:42,979 --> 02:14:50,739
I need to break the fucking video game.

1210
02:14:50,739 --> 02:14:52,989
This is it right here.

1211
02:14:52,989 --> 02:15:24,920
Here we go.

1212
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:28,680
Shit, hold on.

1213
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:34,909
I have to air strafe way sooner.

1214
02:15:34,909 --> 02:15:49,750
Let's go.

1215
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:50,829
Luigi, Luigi!

1216
02:16:04,630 --> 02:16:12,000
That was kind of fun.

1217
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,010
You just scared my cat

1218
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:25,239
and my dad.

1219
02:16:25,239 --> 02:16:27,279
Well, keep me on lower volume.

1220
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:32,360
This is a comedy stream.

1221
02:16:32,360 --> 02:16:33,840
You woke up my husband.

1222
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,120
Well, I,

1223
02:16:35,159 --> 02:16:36,000
why are you listening to me?

1224
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:36,840
Full blast.

1225
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:49,819
What are you doing?

1226
02:16:49,819 --> 02:16:51,379
That was fun.

1227
02:16:51,379 --> 02:17:06,520
That was worth wasting 15 minutes, 20 minutes on.

1228
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:10,680
Is it only two or is it three?

1229
02:17:10,680 --> 02:17:34,229
Oh, it's only two.

1230
02:17:34,229 --> 02:17:36,950
Did you know that scientists have to spend years

1231
02:17:36,950 --> 02:17:37,790
developing new technologies?

1232
02:17:37,790 --> 02:17:42,200
All right, let me turn this off.

1233
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,799
Negative is kind of cool.

1234
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:52,450
How do I just turn it off?

1235
02:17:52,450 --> 02:18:00,299
Do I have to pick one?

1236
02:18:00,299 --> 02:18:04,260
Is warm the default?

1237
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:06,059
Grayscale is the default.

1238
02:18:06,059 --> 02:18:07,649
I'll try warm.

1239
02:18:07,649 --> 02:18:12,430
Actually, I kind of like the color.

1240
02:18:12,430 --> 02:18:13,549
I like the color.

1241
02:18:13,549 --> 02:18:24,629
Wait, there's an optional level here, isn't there?

1242
02:18:24,629 --> 02:18:26,909
Beauty of the simulation.

1243
02:18:27,030 --> 02:18:31,600
What you can achieve in a year's time can be.

1244
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:48,559
I have one shot.

1245
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:49,399
That's not bad.

1246
02:18:49,399 --> 02:18:50,680
I actually prefer the warm.

1247
02:18:50,680 --> 02:18:53,520
I mean, they had the cold tones,

1248
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:59,840
but that's still fine.

1249
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,280
Stop right there and shout your guess.

1250
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,319
Three.

1251
02:19:03,319 --> 02:19:05,079
The answer is three.

1252
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:13,819
These might be useful.

1253
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:28,639
I want my, I want my camera back.

1254
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,399
What should I, happy birthday?

1255
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:50,840
Happy birthday, whoever's birthday it is.

1256
02:19:53,829 --> 02:19:55,350
No photos allowed.

1257
02:20:04,840 --> 02:20:06,799
I only have one shot here.

1258
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:53,399
That was really not what I thought I was gonna, whatever.

1259
02:20:53,399 --> 02:21:21,750
It kind of worked.

1260
02:21:21,750 --> 02:22:00,469
You idiot.

1261
02:22:00,469 --> 02:22:02,930
Now this is content.

1262
02:22:02,930 --> 02:22:04,250
This game is pretty fun.

1263
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:17,079
I like it.

1264
02:22:17,079 --> 02:22:20,139
Okay, one shot in the camera.

1265
02:22:20,139 --> 02:22:22,690
Now what?

1266
02:22:25,959 --> 02:22:27,159
This one's complicated.

1267
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:28,750
Quite.

1268
02:22:29,590 --> 02:22:31,829
I feel like it's gonna be pretty simple.

1269
02:22:31,829 --> 02:22:32,670
Watch this.

1270
02:22:38,590 --> 02:22:42,500
Where is the teleporter?

1271
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:44,610
Over there.

1272
02:22:44,610 --> 02:22:45,770
I need two.

1273
02:22:55,329 --> 02:22:59,690
Okay.

1274
02:22:59,690 --> 02:23:20,280
Where's the other battery?

1275
02:23:26,180 --> 02:23:34,399
Is there more film up there?

1276
02:23:34,399 --> 02:23:35,239
It's all right.

1277
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:40,940
I just want to see what's,

1278
02:23:40,940 --> 02:23:43,799
I only have one thing of film though.

1279
02:23:43,799 --> 02:23:50,360
I need like a wide shot of this.

1280
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:51,200
Oh.

1281
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:15,940
Shit.

1282
02:24:16,180 --> 02:24:22,700
Oh, stop.

1283
02:24:22,700 --> 02:24:25,780
There's one angle I can probably get them both in a picture.

1284
02:24:25,780 --> 02:24:28,090
Through the wall?

1285
02:24:28,090 --> 02:24:30,709
Hold on.

1286
02:24:30,709 --> 02:24:31,989
I go like this.

1287
02:24:31,989 --> 02:24:35,479
Will this count?

1288
02:24:35,479 --> 02:24:38,959
And then say if I do that, does that work?

1289
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:51,479
Kind of.

1290
02:24:51,479 --> 02:24:52,319
I need to.

1291
02:25:06,579 --> 02:25:08,299
Yeah, I know.

1292
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:10,379
But like, ah, it takes a second.

1293
02:25:10,379 --> 02:25:12,579
The easy ones sometimes are,

1294
02:25:12,579 --> 02:25:13,860
they, you know what I mean.

1295
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:21,200
Sometimes it's not that simple.

1296
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:32,940
Takes an extra two seconds.

1297
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:39,090
Hey.

1298
02:25:39,170 --> 02:25:50,399
Now this is the mahjong table.

1299
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:53,420
All right, this turns this on.

1300
02:25:53,420 --> 02:25:54,559
Cool.

1301
02:25:54,559 --> 02:26:02,559
But interesting.

1302
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:08,370
You're all so creative.

1303
02:26:08,370 --> 02:26:14,819
What do you call a melon that commits a crime?

1304
02:26:14,819 --> 02:26:17,020
A water felon.

1305
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:32,379
I didn't even need, I didn't even need to look it up.

1306
02:26:32,379 --> 02:26:35,090
See?

1307
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:36,090
This is weirdly placed.

1308
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:37,090
Why is it like this?

1309
02:26:55,870 --> 02:27:02,659
Probably a duck down here.

1310
02:27:02,659 --> 02:27:14,639
Well, okay.

1311
02:27:14,639 --> 02:27:16,040
You're tracking dirt in.

1312
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,239
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

1313
02:27:17,239 --> 02:27:21,450
Should I sit?

1314
02:27:21,450 --> 02:27:40,739
Ah, nice.

1315
02:27:40,739 --> 02:27:44,690
Yes, we are quite quirky like that.

1316
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:48,200
What did we do?

1317
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:51,969
All right, I need, all right, let's just spin it.

1318
02:27:51,969 --> 02:27:56,100
And just put it over here.

1319
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:04,680
And then this, oh, it's not correct.

1320
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:10,319
Now I know why that hole exists.

1321
02:28:10,319 --> 02:28:21,079
I get the whole thing.

1322
02:28:21,079 --> 02:28:21,920
Okay.

1323
02:28:24,430 --> 02:28:36,159
Then, is there a good place to get this whole thing

1324
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:41,920
on camera?

1325
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:43,840
I hope the camera doesn't break.

1326
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:56,090
Bond over a cat pet session or something.

1327
02:28:57,559 --> 02:28:59,959
I have heard petting is quite soothing.

1328
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:04,260
It's probably right here.

1329
02:29:04,260 --> 02:29:08,299
Yeah.

1330
02:29:08,299 --> 02:29:12,250
Cool.

1331
02:29:12,250 --> 02:29:17,840
Simple.

1332
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,440
You gonna play Armored Core?

1333
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:21,319
I might.

1334
02:29:21,319 --> 02:29:24,319
I'm gonna try it, but I'm gonna be very, very honest.

1335
02:29:24,319 --> 02:29:30,059
I don't know if I'm gonna play it for a while.

1336
02:29:30,059 --> 02:29:31,260
I gave my take on it.

1337
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:34,409
I'm definitely interested.

1338
02:29:34,409 --> 02:29:36,690
Okay, so, looking into this setup,

1339
02:29:36,729 --> 02:29:39,329
there's clearly something wrong with the system.

1340
02:29:39,329 --> 02:29:41,850
The deeper you go, the more the data are corrupt

1341
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:43,569
due to lack of upkeep.

1342
02:29:43,569 --> 02:29:45,250
Definitely gonna do Sorcery later this week,

1343
02:29:45,250 --> 02:29:48,010
but there's a few things to do.

1344
02:29:48,010 --> 02:29:49,610
We'll see.

1345
02:29:49,610 --> 02:29:50,690
I'm interested in it.

1346
02:29:52,409 --> 02:29:55,290
You can tell my chin is currently pointing

1347
02:29:55,290 --> 02:29:56,969
straight down into my neck.

1348
02:29:56,969 --> 02:29:59,530
I'm leaning back because of, you know,

1349
02:29:59,530 --> 02:30:01,690
burp is a hiccup is here.

1350
02:30:01,690 --> 02:30:03,850
But besides that, yeah, I might play it.

1351
02:30:17,079 --> 02:30:20,639
Despite that, it's still wondrous.

1352
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:28,520
Let's go, look at that.

1353
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:33,500
Yeah, it definitely worked.

1354
02:30:33,500 --> 02:32:10,100
Ah, I can't be clever like that.

1355
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:32,790
Oh, Jerma, hey, you're stupid.

1356
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:36,790
Have you been moisturizing your neck?

1357
02:32:36,790 --> 02:32:43,530
Question is, have you?

1358
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:45,090
Well, very clearly, I'm probably gonna shoot

1359
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:48,239
from the bottom up.

1360
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:53,920
How's this?

1361
02:32:53,920 --> 02:33:04,860
Just don't wanna cut it off.

1362
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:13,750
This should do it, right?

1363
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:17,899
Yep.

1364
02:33:17,899 --> 02:33:27,799
I like these ones, these are fun.

1365
02:33:27,799 --> 02:33:35,600
Wait a minute.

1366
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:36,799
Wait, what the?

1367
02:33:36,799 --> 02:33:37,639
What?

1368
02:33:37,639 --> 02:33:38,719
What?

1369
02:33:38,719 --> 02:33:40,950
What happened?

1370
02:33:40,950 --> 02:33:43,049
Where am I?

1371
02:33:43,049 --> 02:34:22,469
And what is down right now?

1372
02:34:22,469 --> 02:34:30,329
What?

1373
02:34:30,329 --> 02:34:33,120
I just tapped it so many times and it...

1374
02:34:33,120 --> 02:34:36,170
Okay, we're good.

1375
02:34:36,170 --> 02:34:40,450
Pray that you've been enjoying your explorations thus far.

1376
02:34:40,450 --> 02:34:42,940
I have been.

1377
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:46,389
Thank you, cat.

1378
02:34:46,389 --> 02:34:48,790
Hamster powering his brain is getting tired.

1379
02:34:54,639 --> 02:34:57,719
That's such a rude comment, but it's funny.

1380
02:34:57,719 --> 02:35:01,190
So you get to stay.

1381
02:35:01,190 --> 02:35:02,030
You know what I mean?

1382
02:35:02,030 --> 02:35:04,870
That's a rude comment, but it was funny.

1383
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:12,200
So you get to stay.

1384
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:29,850
Oh, there's more.

1385
02:35:29,850 --> 02:35:31,969
There's many memories stored here.

1386
02:35:31,969 --> 02:35:34,370
Many impossible things.

1387
02:35:34,370 --> 02:35:35,209
Hmm.

1388
02:35:37,530 --> 02:35:38,530
Filter?

1389
02:35:38,530 --> 02:35:44,100
I like this filter.

1390
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:50,239
Okay.

1391
02:35:50,239 --> 02:35:57,729
So I need to stand here to activate this.

1392
02:35:57,729 --> 02:35:58,930
Is that correct?

1393
02:35:58,930 --> 02:36:00,530
That is correct.

1394
02:36:00,530 --> 02:36:09,979
So I need to take a picture of this while this is activated.

1395
02:36:09,979 --> 02:36:13,280
That was the dumbest idea I've ever had.

1396
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:16,090
Okay.

1397
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:16,969
It's on a timer.

1398
02:36:59,270 --> 02:37:11,120
Okay, I had the right idea.

1399
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:11,959
Get me in there.

1400
02:37:11,959 --> 02:37:48,690
Shit.

1401
02:37:48,690 --> 02:37:49,530
I'm just trying to go.

1402
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:54,579
So I'm just trying to skip it.

1403
02:37:54,579 --> 02:37:55,819
I'm just trying to skip it.

1404
02:37:56,340 --> 02:38:09,709
You know what I mean?

1405
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:19,239
Is this on a timer?

1406
02:38:19,239 --> 02:38:24,329
Okay, this is on a timer too.

1407
02:38:24,329 --> 02:38:25,450
No, it's not.

1408
02:38:25,450 --> 02:38:27,129
So it's just as simple as,

1409
02:38:30,569 --> 02:38:41,159
is it just this simple?

1410
02:38:41,159 --> 02:38:43,399
You're doing great, as Tony would say.

1411
02:38:43,399 --> 02:38:50,719
Thanks, Tony.

1412
02:38:50,719 --> 02:38:58,909
Blueprint.

1413
02:39:08,430 --> 02:39:17,579
I know what to do.

1414
02:39:17,579 --> 02:39:19,750
I know what to do.

1415
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:23,639
Sort of.

1416
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:08,409
Uh-oh.

1417
02:40:08,409 --> 02:40:12,760
That's not good.

1418
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:48,079
Wait a minute.

1419
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:48,959
I feel like I had it right,

1420
02:40:48,959 --> 02:40:59,159
but it's the wrong angle.

1421
02:40:59,159 --> 02:41:16,979
Did I actually have it right?

1422
02:41:16,979 --> 02:41:19,780
You are one brain blip away.

1423
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:41,959
Like this?

1424
02:41:41,959 --> 02:41:44,479
Why won't that get powered?

1425
02:41:44,479 --> 02:42:04,559
I need more.

1426
02:42:04,559 --> 02:42:29,350
Oh, come on.

1427
02:42:29,350 --> 02:43:00,409
I'm touching it.

1428
02:43:00,409 --> 02:43:01,530
I only have one photo.

1429
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:02,370
Shit.

1430
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:03,450
I'm so close.

1431
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:05,850
Somebody said I was one brain blip away.

1432
02:43:11,690 --> 02:43:12,530
It's not.

1433
02:43:12,530 --> 02:43:13,530
Just take a picture of this, right?

1434
02:43:13,530 --> 02:43:18,780
While it's, no, right?

1435
02:43:18,780 --> 02:43:21,280
This didn't work last time, did it?

1436
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:37,649
No.

1437
02:43:37,649 --> 02:43:41,620
Stand on top of it and then grab.

1438
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,459
What angle?

1439
02:43:43,219 --> 02:43:44,360
There's a certain angle I gotta get this from.

1440
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:46,280
I don't know.

1441
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:49,719
I'm trapped here.

1442
02:43:49,719 --> 02:43:52,889
Do I have to go up top?

1443
02:43:52,889 --> 02:43:55,379
No.

1444
02:43:55,379 --> 02:43:56,739
Walk through the problem slowly.

1445
02:43:56,739 --> 02:43:58,950
Okay.

1446
02:43:58,950 --> 02:44:02,239
There is a teleporter over there.

1447
02:44:02,239 --> 02:44:03,239
I have to stand on that.

1448
02:44:03,239 --> 02:44:21,260
I have one photo.

1449
02:44:21,260 --> 02:44:25,510
To do this, I have to depress this plate

1450
02:44:25,510 --> 02:44:30,110
while at the same time, this needs to be upright.

1451
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:39,969
I feel like I did the last three very easily.

1452
02:44:43,399 --> 02:44:44,319
Everybody relax.

1453
02:44:44,319 --> 02:44:45,159
It's all right.

1454
02:44:45,159 --> 02:44:46,000
It's a puzzle game.

1455
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:52,530
You're supposed to take time on some of these.

1456
02:44:53,129 --> 02:44:56,500
Why am I having trouble?

1457
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:57,379
Wait, hold on.

1458
02:44:57,379 --> 02:44:58,219
There's a ladder.

1459
02:45:08,270 --> 02:45:10,440
Maybe.

1460
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:11,280
Maybe.

1461
02:45:16,159 --> 02:45:17,840
No.

1462
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:18,680
I need to get it all.

1463
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:20,819
I need to get it in view.

1464
02:45:20,819 --> 02:45:23,610
The whole thing.

1465
02:45:23,610 --> 02:45:24,450
Shit.

1466
02:45:24,450 --> 02:45:25,649
I don't know.

1467
02:45:25,649 --> 02:45:28,729
This is gonna be so simple and I'm just not seeing it.

1468
02:45:28,729 --> 02:45:31,690
I did the hard ones without a problem,

1469
02:45:31,690 --> 02:45:33,690
but this one is just a head scratcher for me.

1470
02:45:33,690 --> 02:45:34,530
I don't know why.

1471
02:45:37,290 --> 02:45:38,129
I figured I got it.

1472
02:45:38,129 --> 02:45:38,969
I got it.

1473
02:45:38,969 --> 02:45:40,969
The sneeze actually made me know what to do.

1474
02:45:40,969 --> 02:45:42,129
I just had to jumble the brain around a little bit.

1475
02:45:42,129 --> 02:45:42,969
Okay.

1476
02:45:42,969 --> 02:45:47,639
It's over here.

1477
02:45:47,639 --> 02:45:49,950
You gotta take a picture of this.

1478
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:53,760
Hold on.

1479
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:54,600
I got it.

1480
02:45:54,600 --> 02:45:55,440
I got it.

1481
02:45:55,440 --> 02:46:00,040
I got it.

1482
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:00,879
I got it.

1483
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:01,719
I got it.

1484
02:46:01,719 --> 02:46:02,559
I got it.

1485
02:46:02,559 --> 02:46:03,399
I got it.

1486
02:46:03,399 --> 02:46:04,670
Hold on.

1487
02:46:04,670 --> 02:46:05,510
Hold on.

1488
02:46:05,510 --> 02:46:06,350
Hold on.

1489
02:46:06,350 --> 02:46:07,190
It's I have to do it like this.

1490
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:11,239
Watch this.

1491
02:46:11,239 --> 02:46:12,079
Ready?

1492
02:46:12,079 --> 02:46:14,690
Hey, here it is.

1493
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:15,530
All right.

1494
02:46:15,530 --> 02:46:16,370
Now I go over here up on top.

1495
02:46:16,370 --> 02:46:21,159
If I could get on the ladder, that'd be great.

1496
02:46:21,159 --> 02:46:26,200
And then that allows me to, if you check this out,

1497
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:28,840
now I'm able to

1498
02:46:31,649 --> 02:46:35,870
fucking hit this.

1499
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:46,399
I need to know the sneeze quick.

1500
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:49,479
Is there another camera film that I'm not seeing somewhere?

1501
02:46:49,479 --> 02:47:15,760
Am I just overdoing this?

1502
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:16,600
Shit.

1503
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:18,959
This is the only one I've been stuck on for this long.

1504
02:47:18,959 --> 02:47:20,760
I've been playing this game for two and a half hours

1505
02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:21,959
and it's the only one.

1506
02:47:21,959 --> 02:47:30,159
I know it's simple, but I can't, what is it?

1507
02:47:30,159 --> 02:47:31,000
Don't tell me.

1508
02:47:39,850 --> 02:47:51,549
Oh, it didn't work.

1509
02:47:51,549 --> 02:48:00,200
Why did it not work?

1510
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,319
Speed is impressive.

1511
02:48:01,319 --> 02:48:02,159
All right.

1512
02:48:02,159 --> 02:48:06,170
You can take him out of emote only.

1513
02:48:06,170 --> 02:48:08,100
Glad I sneezed.

1514
02:48:08,100 --> 02:48:09,100
I, okay.

1515
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:12,059
Let me tell you what my problem with that solution was.

1516
02:48:12,059 --> 02:48:12,899
Stop.

1517
02:48:12,899 --> 02:48:14,219
Everybody hold on.

1518
02:48:14,219 --> 02:48:17,100
I took a picture of the thing when it was depressed

1519
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:19,899
and when I went, it didn't go forward.

1520
02:48:19,899 --> 02:48:22,420
But when I took a picture of it, when it was timed,

1521
02:48:22,420 --> 02:48:23,979
the timer and you know what I mean?

1522
02:48:23,979 --> 02:48:28,399
That was not all right.

1523
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:31,719
I took a picture of it when it was like this,

1524
02:48:31,719 --> 02:48:44,110
but it doesn't last.

1525
02:48:44,110 --> 02:48:45,950
See, I didn't know that's what it was.

1526
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:46,790
You know what it is?

1527
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:57,489
I did that one instantly.

1528
02:48:57,489 --> 02:48:59,290
You just almost killed me of laughter.

1529
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:05,149
You just sitting there laughing your ass off at that.

1530
02:49:05,149 --> 02:49:07,510
You know that they're gonna study us

1531
02:49:07,510 --> 02:49:08,989
in a hundred years, right?

1532
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:25,319
They're gonna study you.

1533
02:49:25,319 --> 02:49:26,959
Oh, stop.

1534
02:49:26,959 --> 02:49:27,879
Okay.

1535
02:49:27,879 --> 02:49:33,790
This is, I don't have the camera anymore.

1536
02:49:33,790 --> 02:49:34,629
Yeah.

1537
02:49:34,629 --> 02:49:36,569
What do you want to say to people in a hundred years?

1538
02:49:37,290 --> 02:49:38,090
So when some scientist is going through

1539
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:39,569
like the thousands of hours,

1540
02:49:39,569 --> 02:49:42,370
the hundreds of millions of hours of streams

1541
02:49:42,370 --> 02:49:43,889
and videos and stuff,

1542
02:49:43,889 --> 02:49:45,409
they're gonna have, they might see this chat.

1543
02:49:45,409 --> 02:49:47,409
What would you like to say to the scientist

1544
02:49:47,409 --> 02:49:53,610
a hundred years from now?

1545
02:49:53,610 --> 02:49:59,200
Seeing a lot of fuck yous.

1546
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,239
Now this scientist is gonna look at this and be like,

1547
02:50:01,239 --> 02:50:02,079
what?

1548
02:50:02,079 --> 02:50:03,600
How primitive were they?

1549
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,360
They must've been very primitive.

1550
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:08,879
They immediately on talking to a potential scientist

1551
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:12,709
in the future, went right to vulgarities.

1552
02:50:12,709 --> 02:50:18,270
Primitive species.

1553
02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:20,030
Okay.

1554
02:50:20,030 --> 02:50:21,069
I can't look at that.

1555
02:50:21,069 --> 02:50:24,840
That actually was weird.

1556
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:34,139
That was, that was too much for my head.

1557
02:50:34,139 --> 02:50:37,549
I really don't like this level at all.

1558
02:50:37,549 --> 02:50:38,389
If there was a button,

1559
02:50:38,389 --> 02:50:40,030
if I could press F5 and skip this level,

1560
02:50:40,030 --> 02:50:41,659
I would do it right now.

1561
02:50:41,659 --> 02:50:42,739
Not because I don't think it's interesting,

1562
02:50:42,739 --> 02:50:44,379
but because I don't think I can do it.

1563
02:50:44,379 --> 02:50:54,120
I don't think I can handle it.

1564
02:50:54,120 --> 02:51:03,950
Oh, what the fuck?

1565
02:51:03,950 --> 02:51:09,520
God.

1566
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:10,360
Take your time.

1567
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:11,200
You got it.

1568
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:15,379
You beat Sekiro, remember?

1569
02:51:15,379 --> 02:51:16,219
Yeah, I did.

1570
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:18,440
Thanks.

1571
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:19,639
That was a nice chat message.

1572
02:51:19,639 --> 02:51:20,479
I appreciate that.

1573
02:51:20,479 --> 02:51:21,319
Thank you.

1574
02:51:29,229 --> 02:51:30,239
Oh.

1575
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:35,319
Was I supposed to get fooled somehow?

1576
02:51:35,319 --> 02:51:37,879
Oh, I was.

1577
02:51:37,879 --> 02:51:44,930
Wait.

1578
02:51:44,930 --> 02:51:49,600
I think that was supposed to fool me.

1579
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:56,590
Just making sure it's not going to do that again.

1580
02:52:32,930 --> 02:52:48,120
Oh, get over there.

1581
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:48,959
Whoa.

1582
02:52:48,959 --> 02:52:49,920
Oh, that.

1583
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:55,200
All right.

1584
02:52:55,840 --> 02:52:58,200
Somebody on the dev team is a magician.

1585
02:52:58,200 --> 02:52:59,760
Can I make that?

1586
02:52:59,760 --> 02:53:00,719
Can I say that?

1587
02:53:00,719 --> 02:53:01,920
I'm going to say that.

1588
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:05,440
Somebody on the dev team, I think, is a magician.

1589
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:07,920
Like, they know how to do magic and stuff.

1590
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:08,760
You know what I mean?

1591
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:17,670
I think someone's a magician.

1592
02:53:17,670 --> 02:53:19,309
Like card trick.

1593
02:53:19,309 --> 02:53:20,149
Hey, look.

1594
02:53:20,149 --> 02:53:21,469
The salt shaker on the table disappeared.

1595
02:53:21,469 --> 02:53:23,430
That type of magician.

1596
02:53:23,430 --> 02:53:24,270
Yeah.

1597
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:25,110
Oh, yeah.

1598
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:25,950
Yeah, absolutely.

1599
02:53:25,950 --> 02:53:26,790
Somebody's a magician.

1600
02:53:26,790 --> 02:53:34,430
And I'm curious.

1601
02:53:34,430 --> 02:53:40,649
These are little sleight of hand tricks.

1602
02:53:40,649 --> 02:53:46,399
Okay.

1603
02:53:48,969 --> 02:53:50,049
That's, okay.

1604
02:53:50,049 --> 02:53:51,290
That's cool.

1605
02:53:51,290 --> 02:53:54,170
Don't even try to tell me that that's not interesting,

1606
02:53:54,170 --> 02:53:55,409
what we're looking at.

1607
02:53:55,409 --> 02:54:05,149
Because that's really cool.

1608
02:54:05,149 --> 02:54:05,989
All right.

1609
02:54:05,989 --> 02:54:14,079
It is not what it seems.

1610
02:54:14,079 --> 02:54:14,920
Yep.

1611
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:15,760
Uh-huh.

1612
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:17,840
Cool.

1613
02:54:17,840 --> 02:54:21,590
That's just, has that just been here?

1614
02:54:21,590 --> 02:54:28,030
Weird.

1615
02:54:28,030 --> 02:54:28,870
All right.

1616
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,709
Now what?

1617
02:54:29,709 --> 02:54:30,909
Is it saying to go down?

1618
02:54:30,909 --> 02:54:38,120
What, what are we going to, what's the reveal?

1619
02:54:38,120 --> 02:55:02,510
Ah, it's stimulating his monkey brain.

1620
02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:10,540
Should I just fall?

1621
02:55:10,540 --> 02:55:12,540
Ah, that wasn't part of the trick.

1622
02:55:12,540 --> 02:55:13,379
That wasn't part of the trick.

1623
02:55:13,379 --> 02:55:16,020
He went the wrong way.

1624
02:55:16,020 --> 02:55:17,180
He's gone.

1625
02:55:19,049 --> 02:55:21,170
He was supposed to go in the door over here.

1626
02:55:21,170 --> 02:55:24,600
He just walked up the cliff.

1627
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:27,409
Um, watch your step.

1628
02:55:27,409 --> 02:55:30,639
What is it trying to tell me?

1629
02:55:30,639 --> 02:55:37,520
Wrap around and jump this way?

1630
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:38,360
Intriguing.

1631
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:39,200
Okay.

1632
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:41,090
Then from here,

1633
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:44,549
I'm imagining there's probably a false floor here

1634
02:55:44,549 --> 02:55:45,750
that I fall.

1635
02:55:45,750 --> 02:55:56,200
Don't jump, don't jump, don't jump.

1636
02:55:56,200 --> 02:56:00,270
It's telling me to kind of wrap around and fall?

1637
02:56:04,780 --> 02:56:10,299
What is it saying?

1638
02:56:10,299 --> 02:56:12,579
Like go right around a circle

1639
02:56:12,579 --> 02:56:14,940
and then left around the top left circle

1640
02:56:14,940 --> 02:56:22,180
and then straight down.

1641
02:56:22,180 --> 02:56:38,360
Are these directions or is this something else?

1642
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:45,479
I feel like this is correct.

1643
02:56:45,479 --> 02:56:46,319
No.

1644
02:57:05,010 --> 02:57:10,200
No, I was down here already, wasn't I?

1645
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:23,379
Yeah, I was already down here.

1646
02:57:23,379 --> 02:57:27,899
Watch your step.

1647
02:57:27,899 --> 02:57:29,500
Is there just a hole in the ground over here

1648
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:54,010
that I'm not seeing?

1649
02:57:54,010 --> 02:57:59,379
Filtration system proofs for how long?

1650
02:57:59,420 --> 02:58:02,360
Let me sit down for a second.

1651
02:58:02,360 --> 02:58:18,790
What is this trying to tell me?

1652
02:58:18,790 --> 02:58:29,200
I came in this way.

1653
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:34,200
The only logical way is over here, right?

1654
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:36,799
Like this, out this way?

1655
02:58:36,799 --> 02:58:43,149
No.

1656
02:58:43,149 --> 02:58:46,040
I was imagining like right here.

1657
02:58:46,040 --> 02:58:52,069
And then you watch your step.

1658
02:58:52,069 --> 02:59:06,139
No.

1659
02:59:06,139 --> 02:59:06,979
I'm kind of stumped.

1660
02:59:06,979 --> 02:59:09,510
I wonder if it's very simple.

1661
02:59:09,510 --> 02:59:24,229
What does this mean?

1662
02:59:24,229 --> 02:59:44,719
Come on, teleport me down.

1663
02:59:44,719 --> 02:59:48,190
Fuck, I thought that was gonna be it.

1664
02:59:48,190 --> 02:59:49,510
Trace it and then by the,

1665
02:59:49,510 --> 02:59:59,479
your movements of the mouse will bring you down.

1666
02:59:59,479 --> 03:00:02,739
Hold on, let me drink some of my drink.

1667
03:00:02,739 --> 03:00:05,399
You're a clown, you're a clown.

1668
03:00:05,399 --> 03:00:06,239
You're not saying that,

1669
03:00:06,840 --> 03:00:17,719
but that's what I'm getting from the emote.

1670
03:00:17,719 --> 03:00:20,139
Shit.

1671
03:00:20,139 --> 03:00:37,229
Why is there no edge here?

1672
03:00:37,229 --> 03:00:38,559
Ooh, look.

1673
03:00:38,559 --> 03:00:39,399
Look at these.

1674
03:00:39,399 --> 03:00:42,680
Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.

1675
03:00:42,680 --> 03:00:43,520
Here we go.

1676
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:48,819
All right, so it was,

1677
03:00:48,819 --> 03:00:49,780
I don't remember what was,

1678
03:00:49,780 --> 03:00:54,750
oh, don't go that far back.

1679
03:00:54,750 --> 03:01:00,479
All right, so it's around the bottom right,

1680
03:01:00,479 --> 03:01:07,799
loop around the top left, straight out.

1681
03:01:07,799 --> 03:01:11,260
Cool.

1682
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:30,120
All right, sneaky, sneaky.

1683
03:01:30,120 --> 03:01:31,120
He's got yellow brain.

1684
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:34,680
I don't know what he's talking about the pillars.

1685
03:01:34,719 --> 03:01:35,559
Don't let them bully you.

1686
03:01:35,559 --> 03:01:36,719
You did good.

1687
03:01:36,719 --> 03:01:43,319
I think I did fine.

1688
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:44,159
How many batteries?

1689
03:01:44,159 --> 03:01:45,309
Two or three?

1690
03:01:45,309 --> 03:02:03,540
One, really?

1691
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:21,680
It was never gonna be that easy, was it?

1692
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:44,319
How do I get in there?

1693
03:02:44,319 --> 03:02:45,159
Oh, God damn it.

1694
03:02:45,159 --> 03:02:46,319
It's a fake wall.

1695
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:54,969
Okay, that doesn't look right.

1696
03:02:54,969 --> 03:03:14,870
Wait, this does not look right.

1697
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:25,219
I have to take a picture of it before I go reveal it.

1698
03:03:25,219 --> 03:03:26,059
I have to take a picture of it.

1699
03:03:26,059 --> 03:04:17,950
I think I know what to do.

1700
03:04:17,950 --> 03:04:24,840
I like, I know what to do.

1701
03:04:24,840 --> 03:04:34,170
I know what to do.

1702
03:04:34,170 --> 03:04:35,319
Watch this.

1703
03:04:35,319 --> 03:04:49,360
Ready?

1704
03:04:49,360 --> 03:05:02,399
Wait a minute.

1705
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:04,719
I wanna like spin this.

1706
03:05:04,719 --> 03:05:08,120
How do I spin it?

1707
03:05:08,120 --> 03:05:38,639
This?

1708
03:05:38,639 --> 03:05:39,479
Tricky.

1709
03:05:41,270 --> 03:05:43,309
But even if I rotate it, will that matter?

1710
03:05:43,309 --> 03:06:20,750
It's not real.

1711
03:06:20,750 --> 03:06:33,059
Hey, what happened to it?

1712
03:06:33,059 --> 03:06:36,510
Where did it go?

1713
03:06:36,510 --> 03:06:37,520
What?

1714
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:38,399
Oh my goodness.

1715
03:06:38,399 --> 03:06:52,040
I don't know what's going on.

1716
03:06:52,040 --> 03:06:55,149
So I have to make it active, get a picture of it

1717
03:06:55,149 --> 03:07:04,120
and then rotate it and take a picture of it again.

1718
03:07:04,120 --> 03:07:18,760
Wait.

1719
03:07:18,760 --> 03:07:19,600
Okay, okay, okay.

1720
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:24,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1721
03:07:24,159 --> 03:07:31,500
I have to touch it from the front.

1722
03:07:31,500 --> 03:07:49,969
That might be all right.

1723
03:07:49,969 --> 03:07:52,659
I get it, but I don't.

1724
03:07:52,659 --> 03:08:09,159
I get it, but I don't.

1725
03:08:09,159 --> 03:08:18,049
Does that work?

1726
03:08:18,049 --> 03:08:26,360
Shit.

1727
03:08:26,360 --> 03:08:27,200
Fuck it.

1728
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:28,799
I don't know.

1729
03:08:30,100 --> 03:08:32,709
I get it, but I don't.

1730
03:08:32,709 --> 03:08:33,909
I have to take a picture of it

1731
03:08:33,909 --> 03:08:38,239
when it's right facing right at the camera.

1732
03:08:38,239 --> 03:08:45,090
How do I get it to move without it being the wrong direction?

1733
03:08:45,090 --> 03:08:47,329
I have a different idea.

1734
03:08:47,329 --> 03:08:50,239
Let me try this.

1735
03:08:50,239 --> 03:08:55,250
I do what I just did and then I take a picture of it

1736
03:08:55,250 --> 03:08:58,920
and then I put it the other direction.

1737
03:08:58,920 --> 03:09:06,409
Let me try that.

1738
03:09:06,409 --> 03:09:10,260
So now what happens if I do this?

1739
03:09:10,260 --> 03:09:13,659
Will it be facing the right way?

1740
03:09:13,659 --> 03:09:14,500
Do you know what I mean by this?

1741
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:23,219
You see what I'm doing?

1742
03:09:23,219 --> 03:09:27,899
I mean, that's correct, but it's not right.

1743
03:09:28,700 --> 03:09:31,159
It's kind of correct.

1744
03:09:31,159 --> 03:09:32,319
What if I just, can I drop it?

1745
03:09:32,319 --> 03:09:33,159
Will it fall out?

1746
03:09:33,159 --> 03:09:41,350
No.

1747
03:09:41,350 --> 03:09:48,360
Ah, this is a, this is a stumper.

1748
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:50,479
Like, well, can I, will it just, it's not falling.

1749
03:09:50,479 --> 03:10:00,020
Wait a minute.

1750
03:10:00,020 --> 03:10:05,559
That's not what I have to do, is it?

1751
03:10:05,559 --> 03:10:07,180
There's nothing there.

1752
03:10:07,180 --> 03:10:12,129
It's, the shit's empty.

1753
03:10:12,129 --> 03:10:12,969
There's nothing.

1754
03:10:12,969 --> 03:10:15,409
Ah, huh?

1755
03:10:15,409 --> 03:10:16,409
There's nothing there.

1756
03:10:16,409 --> 03:10:22,239
I would have tried that.

1757
03:10:22,239 --> 03:10:24,159
I would have just, I would have tried to do that.

1758
03:10:24,159 --> 03:10:36,110
What the hell?

1759
03:10:36,110 --> 03:10:38,280
I would have probably tried that.

1760
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:41,840
Oh, what?

1761
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:42,680
Well, okay.

1762
03:10:48,950 --> 03:10:49,790
Oh, I beat it.

1763
03:10:55,500 --> 03:10:57,170
Was it bugged?

1764
03:10:57,170 --> 03:10:58,090
It was bugged.

1765
03:10:58,090 --> 03:10:59,530
It was bugged.

1766
03:10:59,530 --> 03:11:01,969
Wow, okay, that makes sense.

1767
03:11:01,969 --> 03:11:05,319
I was wondering, I was like, why is it not there?

1768
03:11:05,319 --> 03:11:07,360
I thought I had to touch it for then it to be active

1769
03:11:07,360 --> 03:11:09,799
that it would be there.

1770
03:11:09,799 --> 03:11:12,360
All right, I want to do the super secret level.

1771
03:11:12,360 --> 03:11:18,950
Where is it?

1772
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:29,440
All the way up?

1773
03:11:29,440 --> 03:11:33,659
It was there one time where it didn't show up.

1774
03:11:33,659 --> 03:11:35,100
Yeah, I thought that was a bug

1775
03:11:35,100 --> 03:11:37,299
that it wasn't supposed to be there when it flashed.

1776
03:11:37,299 --> 03:11:39,180
So I was like, oh, that was a bug that it was not,

1777
03:11:39,540 --> 03:11:43,079
that it's not supposed to be there.

1778
03:11:46,979 --> 03:11:48,579
There's no optional level here?

1779
03:11:48,579 --> 03:11:49,540
Oh, okay.

1780
03:11:49,540 --> 03:11:52,950
Let's go.

1781
03:11:52,950 --> 03:11:55,329
I'm going to take a quick break.

1782
03:11:55,329 --> 03:11:56,329
Looks like we have,

1783
03:11:58,370 --> 03:12:00,170
we have a pretty decent amount left.

1784
03:12:01,049 --> 03:12:02,409
Two more chapters.

1785
03:12:02,409 --> 03:12:03,250
I will be right back.

1786
03:12:03,250 --> 03:12:05,250
I'm going to pee, refill my drink.

1787
03:12:05,250 --> 03:17:36,040
See you guys in a minute.

1788
03:17:36,040 --> 03:17:42,489
Looks like we got two more, oh, wow, what a blunder.

1789
03:17:42,530 --> 03:17:44,559
Give me one more second.

1790
03:17:44,559 --> 03:17:46,579
My drink, the other room.

1791
03:17:46,579 --> 03:20:14,799
Give me one second.

1792
03:20:16,520 --> 03:20:18,440
Cookies.

1793
03:20:18,440 --> 03:20:30,870
I want cookies.

1794
03:20:30,870 --> 03:20:33,690
Keep going.

1795
03:20:33,690 --> 03:20:39,670
So this is chapter four.

1796
03:20:39,670 --> 03:20:40,510
Let's go.

1797
03:20:40,510 --> 03:20:42,459
Mirren's workspace awaits.

1798
03:20:42,459 --> 03:20:46,940
She's rather special who started all of this

1799
03:20:46,940 --> 03:20:49,020
with good intentions, no less.

1800
03:20:49,020 --> 03:20:53,799
She even made me, and for that, I will always be thankful.

1801
03:20:53,799 --> 03:21:03,799
Even though she, she really loved this place.

1802
03:21:03,799 --> 03:21:16,889
How many blinkers did you just hit?

1803
03:21:16,889 --> 03:21:19,590
Oh, this one's cool.

1804
03:21:19,590 --> 03:21:20,430
Observatory.

1805
03:21:26,959 --> 03:21:28,659
It's different, isn't it?

1806
03:21:28,659 --> 03:21:31,059
Mirren was passionate about her studies.

1807
03:21:43,200 --> 03:21:48,649
I love the music in here.

1808
03:21:48,649 --> 03:21:54,690
Pretty relaxing.

1809
03:21:54,690 --> 03:21:57,079
Okay, let's go.

1810
03:21:57,079 --> 03:22:02,059
What mechanic are they going to introduce now?

1811
03:22:02,059 --> 03:22:09,250
Two batteries?

1812
03:22:09,250 --> 03:22:13,920
Why are the batteries different?

1813
03:22:13,920 --> 03:22:16,000
It's spreading, I'm concerned.

1814
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:19,760
Is this a regular battery?

1815
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:25,260
Why is it so, oh, that's what makes it so weird.

1816
03:22:26,100 --> 03:22:49,159
You can't take a picture of these phantom batteries.

1817
03:22:49,159 --> 03:22:58,829
Oh, whatever, just put it right here.

1818
03:23:05,940 --> 03:23:07,299
That was just a cough.

1819
03:23:07,299 --> 03:23:09,780
That was just a regular cough.

1820
03:23:09,780 --> 03:23:11,219
It was a regular cough.

1821
03:23:11,219 --> 03:23:13,700
It had nothing, it had nothing to do

1822
03:23:13,700 --> 03:23:17,379
with any of the things that you're talking about.

1823
03:23:17,379 --> 03:23:18,899
It was just a little, okay.

1824
03:23:18,899 --> 03:23:20,760
You know what the cough is from?

1825
03:23:20,760 --> 03:23:24,280
I just drank a bunch of kefir and it's just settling

1826
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:25,399
and it was like, okay, it's settled

1827
03:23:25,399 --> 03:23:27,799
and I had to clear my throat a little.

1828
03:23:27,799 --> 03:23:42,520
That's it.

1829
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:50,069
Can I pick up everything or just the kefir?

1830
03:23:50,069 --> 03:23:52,790
If kefir is, oh, hold on.

1831
03:23:52,790 --> 03:23:55,200
People are talking about snacks.

1832
03:23:55,200 --> 03:23:59,739
Saying, hey, hey, what's your snack of choice right now?

1833
03:23:59,739 --> 03:24:09,719
Kefir is another one?

1834
03:24:09,719 --> 03:24:18,600
Wait, okay, so that can remove that gray stuff.

1835
03:24:23,639 --> 03:24:31,370
There it is, cool.

1836
03:24:31,370 --> 03:24:40,389
Um, what do I take a picture of?

1837
03:24:40,389 --> 03:24:42,110
This is incredible.

1838
03:24:42,110 --> 03:24:45,069
The system is self-learning and ever-growing.

1839
03:24:45,069 --> 03:24:46,950
It can be used to build structures,

1840
03:24:46,950 --> 03:24:49,629
new buildings, support it on its own energy.

1841
03:24:49,629 --> 03:24:51,829
This could truly help push the principles

1842
03:24:51,829 --> 03:24:53,389
of my research to new heights.

1843
03:24:54,389 --> 03:25:01,200
I need to show this to Haria immediately.

1844
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:06,409
Excited.

1845
03:25:06,409 --> 03:25:36,729
Um, what am I missing here?

1846
03:25:36,729 --> 03:25:38,709
What?

1847
03:25:38,709 --> 03:25:45,420
That's not what I took a picture of.

1848
03:25:45,420 --> 03:26:00,159
I wanted to roll this down the stairs.

1849
03:26:00,159 --> 03:26:02,120
Okay, what?

1850
03:26:02,120 --> 03:26:41,680
So I'm supposed to clear something with this.

1851
03:26:41,680 --> 03:27:01,959
The teleporter, what the hell is going on?

1852
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,350
I take a picture of the, this right here?

1853
03:27:04,350 --> 03:27:07,049
I'm like, what is, okay.

1854
03:27:07,049 --> 03:27:11,680
So can I, I don't know, can I walk up this or something?

1855
03:27:11,680 --> 03:28:08,719
Where's the game progress?

1856
03:28:08,719 --> 03:28:17,180
Um, I don't know.

1857
03:28:17,180 --> 03:28:20,940
Oh, Matt, I probably have to climb up this, right?

1858
03:28:20,940 --> 03:28:33,559
Somewhere?

1859
03:28:33,559 --> 03:28:37,280
Hi, okay.

1860
03:28:38,889 --> 03:28:46,100
I, again, I'm playing chess

1861
03:28:46,100 --> 03:29:05,549
when I should be playing checkers.

1862
03:29:05,549 --> 03:29:12,600
There is the end of the phone call.

1863
03:29:12,600 --> 03:29:15,500
He made it, I'm so happy.

1864
03:29:15,500 --> 03:29:16,940
Nice work.

1865
03:29:17,459 --> 03:29:18,700
Appreciate the view, you made this,

1866
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:20,100
you can master anything.

1867
03:29:26,459 --> 03:29:28,299
The weather disruptor.

1868
03:29:31,379 --> 03:29:32,579
We're gonna make, um,

1869
03:29:34,340 --> 03:29:35,780
weather machine or something?

1870
03:29:40,319 --> 03:29:42,750
I need film for the camera.

1871
03:29:42,750 --> 03:29:43,590
Oh, hi, can we reach?

1872
03:29:43,590 --> 03:29:51,219
Not even the sky can limit us.

1873
03:29:51,219 --> 03:29:55,149
All right, there's a, something over there.

1874
03:29:55,149 --> 03:30:00,389
Looking for film for the camera.

1875
03:30:00,430 --> 03:30:03,200
Okay, is that film?

1876
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:04,680
Nice milk voice.

1877
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:15,979
Yeah, yeah.

1878
03:30:15,979 --> 03:30:16,819
Here we go.

1879
03:30:16,819 --> 03:30:18,309
I'm sure you noticed by now,

1880
03:30:18,309 --> 03:30:21,840
using film was always Mirren's idea,

1881
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:27,950
one of her many passions.

1882
03:30:27,950 --> 03:30:38,440
All right, now make the bridge to the film.

1883
03:30:38,440 --> 03:30:41,479
That's the fucking worst bridge

1884
03:30:41,479 --> 03:30:45,670
I've ever made in a video game.

1885
03:30:45,670 --> 03:30:53,760
That has to be the worst bridge I've ever done.

1886
03:30:53,760 --> 03:31:03,569
I, okay, everything's fine

1887
03:31:03,569 --> 03:31:36,920
because you need to do it like that.

1888
03:31:37,360 --> 03:31:38,200
I know what to do.

1889
03:31:38,200 --> 03:31:52,170
You gotta go down here.

1890
03:31:52,170 --> 03:32:18,290
Enough solution.

1891
03:32:18,290 --> 03:32:19,370
What do you mean, dude?

1892
03:32:19,370 --> 03:32:20,889
I have it right.

1893
03:32:20,889 --> 03:32:53,000
I just didn't do it in the right spot.

1894
03:32:53,000 --> 03:33:04,129
Hey, I made it.

1895
03:33:04,129 --> 03:33:06,559
Look at that.

1896
03:33:19,469 --> 03:33:21,030
Five pictures, oh boy.

1897
03:33:21,030 --> 03:33:24,200
This is gonna take a lot of brain power.

1898
03:33:24,200 --> 03:33:27,840
This might be the one.

1899
03:33:27,840 --> 03:33:33,479
Okay, five photos.

1900
03:33:33,479 --> 03:33:34,319
What do we got?

1901
03:33:34,319 --> 03:33:41,899
We got a foil, two batteries, and a cage.

1902
03:33:41,899 --> 03:33:44,610
Okay, I need to take pictures of batteries

1903
03:33:44,610 --> 03:33:48,120
and drop them in here.

1904
03:33:48,120 --> 03:33:53,639
Go look for those first.

1905
03:33:53,639 --> 03:34:00,620
Use, useless junk for play with.

1906
03:34:00,620 --> 03:34:32,059
That's not a battery all the way over there, is it?

1907
03:34:32,059 --> 03:34:35,809
Nobody said they wanted to bet on that.

1908
03:34:35,809 --> 03:34:39,360
You would have lost.

1909
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:43,090
Let's take a selfie and clone yourself.

1910
03:34:43,090 --> 03:34:44,090
Well, I'd have to set the camera up

1911
03:34:44,090 --> 03:34:46,120
and get my entire body though.

1912
03:34:46,120 --> 03:34:52,409
Otherwise it would just be awful.

1913
03:34:52,409 --> 03:34:59,600
One battery, that's it.

1914
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:11,750
Dude, you're a lot smarter now that you have a job.

1915
03:35:11,750 --> 03:35:14,190
Oh no, he has to use his brain every day.

1916
03:35:14,190 --> 03:35:16,389
This is, I don't like this anymore.

1917
03:35:21,479 --> 03:35:24,260
Okay, so what do we do with this?

1918
03:35:24,260 --> 03:35:29,069
How about cupcakes?

1919
03:35:29,069 --> 03:35:40,819
How about, how about cupcakes?

1920
03:35:41,059 --> 03:35:48,709
Whoa, shit.

1921
03:35:48,709 --> 03:36:09,239
Um, well, interesting.

1922
03:36:09,239 --> 03:36:15,790
I need to go down and put it like there.

1923
03:36:15,790 --> 03:36:26,549
Oh, uh, what's going on here?

1924
03:36:26,549 --> 03:37:25,010
Jesus, I didn't want to do that.

1925
03:37:25,010 --> 03:37:29,360
I have to drop it from here and catch it.

1926
03:37:29,479 --> 03:37:31,159
Drop it from here and catch it.

1927
03:37:53,950 --> 03:38:01,299
No, I'm going to do something insane.

1928
03:38:01,299 --> 03:38:03,760
It's going to work.

1929
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:05,159
It's going to work.

1930
03:38:05,159 --> 03:38:13,250
Check this out.

1931
03:38:13,250 --> 03:38:23,370
Okay, watch this.

1932
03:38:23,370 --> 03:38:42,180
So far so good.

1933
03:38:42,180 --> 03:38:43,139
What the fuck?

1934
03:38:43,139 --> 03:38:47,559
This is not what I thought that was.

1935
03:38:47,559 --> 03:38:49,040
Oh, I thought this was flat.

1936
03:38:49,040 --> 03:38:53,149
I thought this was a flat painting.

1937
03:38:53,149 --> 03:38:57,479
Oh boy, that's makes everything different now.

1938
03:38:57,479 --> 03:39:02,940
Okay, well, my plan was not a good one then.

1939
03:39:02,940 --> 03:39:08,040
My plan was really bad.

1940
03:39:08,040 --> 03:39:23,209
Knowing that, I, I, I, I don't know.

1941
03:39:25,379 --> 03:39:38,319
Is something in here that I can get?

1942
03:39:38,319 --> 03:39:42,299
The, the, the, the beats.

1943
03:39:42,299 --> 03:39:49,920
Yeah, okay, more film and a ball.

1944
03:39:49,920 --> 03:39:54,040
I guess maybe this, does that make sense?

1945
03:39:54,040 --> 03:40:00,770
Sense, does that make sense what I just did?

1946
03:40:00,770 --> 03:40:24,000
How do I get out of here then?

1947
03:40:24,000 --> 03:40:31,739
Um, shit, I don't really know what to do here.

1948
03:40:31,739 --> 03:40:37,770
I guess I could, I have to like replace

1949
03:40:37,770 --> 03:40:43,079
this whole level with this thing, kind of.

1950
03:40:43,079 --> 03:40:47,870
I'm going to try my stupid idea.

1951
03:40:48,629 --> 03:41:03,469
My idea is really dumb.

1952
03:41:03,469 --> 03:41:18,600
It's my idea is actually completely moronic.

1953
03:41:18,600 --> 03:42:04,799
Like this is the worst idea I've ever had.

1954
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:06,600
What do I do?

1955
03:42:06,600 --> 03:42:13,879
Um, not over here, right?

1956
03:42:13,879 --> 03:42:22,120
I wish I could move it forward and backwards.

1957
03:42:22,120 --> 03:42:25,049
I mean, catching this makes the most sense,

1958
03:42:25,049 --> 03:42:30,200
but then how do I get out of there?

1959
03:42:30,200 --> 03:43:22,739
I mean, how do I get out of there?

1960
03:43:22,739 --> 03:43:34,879
What a fucking mess, but I think it's going to work.

1961
03:43:35,879 --> 03:43:37,819
I actually think I just did it.

1962
03:43:37,819 --> 03:43:39,979
Yeah, I think I got it.

1963
03:43:40,059 --> 03:43:45,100
Did I?

1964
03:43:45,100 --> 03:43:46,180
It's right there.

1965
03:43:46,180 --> 03:43:47,219
It's the right idea.

1966
03:43:47,219 --> 03:44:20,110
Hold on.

1967
03:44:20,110 --> 03:44:22,190
How can we be silent?

1968
03:44:22,190 --> 03:44:24,870
I'm, I'm trying to concentrate.

1969
03:44:24,870 --> 03:44:30,690
It's, this is a lot of brain power.

1970
03:44:30,690 --> 03:44:32,129
What pictures did I take?

1971
03:44:32,129 --> 03:44:34,930
Why is there a whole fucking building over here?

1972
03:44:34,930 --> 03:44:36,290
What is all this?

1973
03:44:36,290 --> 03:44:37,649
What is all that?

1974
03:44:37,649 --> 03:44:38,770
I'm so confused.

1975
03:44:38,770 --> 03:45:03,329
I wanted just a picture of the tile.

1976
03:45:03,329 --> 03:45:12,030
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1977
03:45:12,149 --> 03:45:14,229
Okay, okay.

1978
03:45:14,229 --> 03:45:16,790
Yeah, yeah, it sure is.

1979
03:45:16,790 --> 03:45:18,270
It sure is that, isn't it?

1980
03:45:19,709 --> 03:45:20,549
Okay.

1981
03:45:20,549 --> 03:45:21,879
I was wondering how you would call this.

1982
03:45:21,879 --> 03:45:26,850
That was so long.

1983
03:45:26,850 --> 03:45:28,450
Oh, that was so long.

1984
03:45:28,450 --> 03:45:31,530
That took so, I was going to build a whole structure

1985
03:45:31,530 --> 03:45:36,190
to pick that up and walk it all the way back.

1986
03:45:36,190 --> 03:45:50,879
Wow, I can't believe it.

1987
03:45:50,879 --> 03:45:56,680
Okay, we're good.

1988
03:45:56,680 --> 03:45:57,600
Chill stream tonight?

1989
03:45:57,600 --> 03:46:00,950
Yeah, I'm, I'm just hanging out.

1990
03:46:00,950 --> 03:46:03,750
I'm having a good time.

1991
03:46:03,750 --> 03:46:16,760
Okay, here's the problem.

1992
03:46:16,760 --> 03:46:49,760
How do I get them both?

1993
03:46:49,760 --> 03:46:58,440
Hmm, can I get around?

1994
03:46:58,440 --> 03:46:59,479
What is this here for?

1995
03:46:59,479 --> 03:47:53,159
This has got to be here for a reason, right?

1996
03:47:53,159 --> 03:48:01,989
I only have one picture.

1997
03:48:01,989 --> 03:48:04,950
I have one photo to take.

1998
03:48:04,950 --> 03:48:11,870
I just don't know what to take it of.

1999
03:48:11,870 --> 03:48:16,889
You want me to take a picture right up here, don't you?

2000
03:48:16,889 --> 03:48:32,870
All right, I get a picture of the sky.

2001
03:48:32,870 --> 03:48:34,030
That's not what they wanted.

2002
03:48:34,030 --> 03:48:45,540
Okay.

2003
03:48:45,540 --> 03:48:48,059
I'm going to get it right here.

2004
03:48:48,059 --> 03:48:49,180
I just did it.

2005
03:48:49,180 --> 03:48:50,020
I just did it.

2006
03:48:50,020 --> 03:48:54,620
Watch this.

2007
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:55,459
Watch this shit.

2008
03:48:55,459 --> 03:48:57,299
You think, you guys think I'm fucking around right now?

2009
03:48:57,299 --> 03:48:58,219
You think I'm fucking around?

2010
03:48:58,219 --> 03:49:45,760
Watch this.

2011
03:49:46,319 --> 03:49:51,569
I got, I'm going to get it right here.

2012
03:49:51,569 --> 03:49:57,360
Oh, come on.

2013
03:49:57,360 --> 03:50:13,639
If I only had another shot to take.

2014
03:50:13,639 --> 03:50:18,840
I'm so, it's so far away.

2015
03:50:18,840 --> 03:50:22,290
It's right here, but it's just not right here.

2016
03:51:01,959 --> 03:51:03,319
Press it.

2017
03:51:03,319 --> 03:51:04,590
Press it.

2018
03:51:04,590 --> 03:51:06,639
Press it.

2019
03:51:06,639 --> 03:51:08,969
Press it.

2020
03:51:08,969 --> 03:51:11,010
What's up?

2021
03:51:11,010 --> 03:51:17,229
What's up, cat?

2022
03:51:17,229 --> 03:51:22,469
Huh?

2023
03:51:22,469 --> 03:51:23,729
What do you mean?

2024
03:51:23,729 --> 03:51:34,090
What's wrong with it?

2025
03:51:34,090 --> 03:51:35,170
Fuck you.

2026
03:51:35,170 --> 03:51:36,450
God damn it.

2027
03:51:36,450 --> 03:51:47,260
I just learned that by doing, we're good.

2028
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:50,489
Everything's fine.

2029
03:51:50,489 --> 03:51:57,360
You take the picture through the wall.

2030
03:51:57,360 --> 03:52:00,299
Is this your solution to heal the world?

2031
03:52:00,299 --> 03:52:01,739
Brute forcing the puzzle.

2032
03:52:01,739 --> 03:52:07,000
Well, hey, we all have different ways of learning.

2033
03:52:07,000 --> 03:52:09,360
My way of learning was jumping off the side of the building

2034
03:52:09,360 --> 03:52:11,959
and trying to take a picture of it while it came into view

2035
03:52:11,959 --> 03:52:16,959
to then slide down it while falling to my death.

2036
03:52:16,959 --> 03:52:19,399
And you can just take pictures through walls.

2037
03:52:19,399 --> 03:52:24,760
So, but I figured that out because I did that hypothesis.

2038
03:52:24,799 --> 03:52:32,799
So I figured it out still.

2039
03:52:32,799 --> 03:52:33,639
All right, this will be interesting.

2040
03:52:33,639 --> 03:52:37,319
What, where am I going?

2041
03:52:37,319 --> 03:52:43,270
This one, we're doing the same thing we did before.

2042
03:52:43,270 --> 03:52:45,069
I've already learned.

2043
03:52:45,069 --> 03:52:47,399
I already know what's happening.

2044
03:52:47,399 --> 03:52:49,670
I already got it.

2045
03:52:49,670 --> 03:52:51,389
Pretty much a done deal already.

2046
03:53:14,559 --> 03:53:20,350
There we go.

2047
03:53:20,350 --> 03:53:21,909
Stop with the pictures already.

2048
03:53:25,739 --> 03:53:26,739
It's the whole game.

2049
03:53:29,040 --> 03:53:30,709
I'm going to go cold.

2050
03:53:30,709 --> 03:53:38,219
I like the cold colors.

2051
03:53:38,219 --> 03:53:40,420
Optional challenge.

2052
03:53:40,420 --> 03:54:01,530
I want to take a look at it.

2053
03:54:01,530 --> 03:54:03,250
There's gotta be a way, right?

2054
03:54:03,250 --> 03:54:07,549
Hold on.

2055
03:54:07,549 --> 03:54:12,809
Come on, there's gotta be a way to take,

2056
03:54:12,809 --> 03:54:20,700
to keep this going infinitely.

2057
03:54:20,700 --> 03:54:35,479
I don't think there is.

2058
03:54:35,479 --> 03:54:45,739
Is there another one?

2059
03:54:45,739 --> 03:54:54,139
Oh, wait, is this just very simple?

2060
03:54:54,139 --> 03:55:30,229
Oh, I need, wait a minute.

2061
03:55:30,229 --> 03:55:41,040
There it is.

2062
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:42,280
One, two, three.

2063
03:55:42,280 --> 03:55:57,680
Wait, I need one, yeah, one more.

2064
03:55:57,680 --> 03:55:59,940
Did I cheat?

2065
03:55:59,940 --> 03:56:04,719
No, I think that's what you're supposed to do though.

2066
03:56:04,719 --> 03:56:07,819
That was a fun one, I liked that one.

2067
03:56:07,819 --> 03:56:12,500
New camera filter, painting.

2068
03:56:12,500 --> 03:56:22,610
I'm kind of curious about that.

2069
03:56:22,610 --> 03:56:26,930
Does it look much different?

2070
03:56:27,569 --> 03:56:28,770
How do you even program this?

2071
03:56:28,770 --> 03:56:30,680
That's what I'm saying.

2072
03:56:30,680 --> 03:56:38,010
That's wild.

2073
03:56:38,010 --> 03:56:48,899
All right, somebody can take a screenshot of that.

2074
03:56:50,229 --> 03:56:53,590
Music, I must admit, magnificent with the guitar.

2075
03:56:53,590 --> 03:56:56,559
She's promised to come play for us here again.

2076
03:56:56,559 --> 03:56:57,559
I have more tests to perform

2077
03:56:57,559 --> 03:57:00,040
before sharing my theories with the others.

2078
03:57:00,040 --> 03:57:01,040
I haven't felt disinvigorated

2079
03:57:01,040 --> 03:57:02,959
since my first successful Violet build.

2080
03:57:02,959 --> 03:57:07,680
All right.

2081
03:57:07,680 --> 03:57:09,260
All right, coil.

2082
03:57:09,260 --> 03:57:12,370
A lot of coils.

2083
03:57:12,370 --> 03:57:13,729
Far too many coils in this one.

2084
03:57:13,729 --> 03:57:14,569
So I have to power all,

2085
03:57:14,569 --> 03:57:19,889
I gotta power up all these.

2086
03:57:20,889 --> 03:57:22,850
It's interesting, that's for sure.

2087
03:57:22,850 --> 03:57:25,049
All right, this one is powered.

2088
03:57:27,290 --> 03:57:29,930
The radio is what powers the coils.

2089
03:57:33,659 --> 03:57:39,110
Okay, so here's what we're gonna do.

2090
03:57:39,110 --> 03:58:06,399
Try it the simplest way possible.

2091
03:58:06,399 --> 03:58:13,950
Shit.

2092
03:58:13,950 --> 03:58:28,180
Ugh, no.

2093
03:58:28,180 --> 03:58:36,879
That's them all, yep, nice.

2094
03:58:36,879 --> 03:58:39,420
I got a flow, I'm in the zone right now.

2095
03:58:52,280 --> 03:58:55,579
Okay, coils.

2096
03:58:56,260 --> 03:58:59,120
This is lever.

2097
03:58:59,120 --> 03:59:03,620
All right, so I need a radio box to go right here.

2098
03:59:03,620 --> 03:59:05,299
The hamster is running, oh yeah.

2099
03:59:11,440 --> 03:59:14,799
A beat that just makes you wanna get up and dance.

2100
03:59:14,799 --> 03:59:22,090
And also power a teleporter over here.

2101
03:59:22,090 --> 03:59:31,549
All right, is that it?

2102
03:59:31,549 --> 03:59:39,459
Oh, that's it, but wait, there's one over here.

2103
03:59:39,459 --> 03:59:43,500
Oh, no, that's it, there's one.

2104
03:59:43,500 --> 03:59:52,809
5G audio.

2105
03:59:52,809 --> 04:00:03,969
Telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone, telephone.

2106
04:00:03,969 --> 04:00:12,110
Wait, I can't take a picture of that.

2107
04:00:12,110 --> 04:00:13,870
Good to hear from you, bud.

2108
04:00:13,909 --> 04:00:21,040
Okay, so this is a photo.

2109
04:00:21,040 --> 04:00:21,879
I get it.

2110
04:00:21,879 --> 04:00:24,409
All right, so I have a camera, right?

2111
04:00:44,639 --> 04:00:52,520
Yeah, okay.

2112
04:00:52,520 --> 04:01:02,969
I'm really rolling on this one.

2113
04:01:02,969 --> 04:01:11,940
Five pictures, I wonder if it's just timer, right?

2114
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:20,889
Oh, this is gonna be easy, watch this.

2115
04:01:20,889 --> 04:01:55,889
Nevermind.

2116
04:02:03,260 --> 04:02:05,340
Light travel, sound travels, light pulse sound

2117
04:02:05,340 --> 04:02:29,639
equals kinematics of weather events using light and sound.

2118
04:02:29,639 --> 04:02:30,520
I think I have an idea, ready?

2119
04:02:30,520 --> 04:02:42,959
Watch this, and let me look around.

2120
04:02:42,959 --> 04:02:44,920
Can I play something on here?

2121
04:02:44,920 --> 04:02:52,200
I don't think so.

2122
04:02:52,200 --> 04:02:54,899
I think I have to stick it closer and closer.

2123
04:02:54,899 --> 04:03:08,399
How?

2124
04:03:12,950 --> 04:03:18,190
Oh, yep, watch this.

2125
04:03:18,190 --> 04:04:01,930
That's definitely how I'm gonna do it.

2126
04:04:01,930 --> 04:04:19,139
Oh, I have to be standing the right way.

2127
04:04:19,139 --> 04:04:22,200
I got it at the beginning when we take pictures.

2128
04:04:22,200 --> 04:05:19,440
Um, I don't get it.

2129
04:05:27,620 --> 04:05:36,379
I get it.

2130
04:05:36,379 --> 04:05:39,399
Let's get a picture of this.

2131
04:05:39,399 --> 04:05:44,229
No, nevermind.

2132
04:05:44,229 --> 04:05:47,879
So I have to bring it, I don't know.

2133
04:05:47,879 --> 04:05:49,879
I can't take a picture of that.

2134
04:05:49,879 --> 04:05:53,090
That doesn't do anything.

2135
04:05:53,090 --> 04:05:56,469
What can I do?

2136
04:05:56,469 --> 04:06:24,959
Interesting.

2137
04:06:24,959 --> 04:06:27,649
Oh, hold on, it's right there.

2138
04:06:27,649 --> 04:06:45,280
I already got it.

2139
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:50,360
Here's the, whoa, oh boy.

2140
04:06:50,360 --> 04:07:13,920
This is gonna take a little bit of extra peanut butter.

2141
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:18,319
So not much else to do, but that's kind of cool.

2142
04:07:18,319 --> 04:07:34,729
So I'm just gonna play with this.

2143
04:07:34,729 --> 04:07:36,260
Thank you.

2144
04:07:36,260 --> 04:09:11,750
I'll cherish this.

2145
04:09:11,750 --> 04:09:12,590
Okay.

2146
04:09:17,040 --> 04:09:19,079
Can you think of like the most childish image to draw?

2147
04:09:19,079 --> 04:09:21,799
Like, I'm just thinking, okay, what would you draw

2148
04:09:21,799 --> 04:09:25,790
to be like really just, oh, I know.

2149
04:09:25,790 --> 04:09:29,079
How about like somebody with like the finger?

2150
04:09:29,079 --> 04:09:30,600
No, he's gonna be waving.

2151
04:09:30,600 --> 04:10:06,180
Ready?

2152
04:10:06,180 --> 04:10:10,329
No, that's fun.

2153
04:10:10,329 --> 04:10:18,069
It's a cat.

2154
04:10:18,069 --> 04:10:21,600
All right, now this is where the fun begins.

2155
04:10:21,600 --> 04:10:25,409
All right, we need that.

2156
04:10:25,409 --> 04:10:32,959
We need this to be, jeez.

2157
04:10:34,180 --> 04:10:39,159
Actually, this has to be first, I think, right?

2158
04:10:39,159 --> 04:10:55,840
So if I go like that here,

2159
04:10:55,840 --> 04:11:02,639
and this needs to be right here.

2160
04:11:02,639 --> 04:11:07,879
Is that gonna work?

2161
04:11:07,879 --> 04:11:11,790
Oh, yes.

2162
04:11:11,790 --> 04:11:15,389
Where there is truly a fickle thing,

2163
04:11:15,389 --> 04:11:21,090
the claimant can impound non-living thing.

2164
04:11:21,090 --> 04:11:26,680
Impossible questions and impossible solutions.

2165
04:11:26,680 --> 04:11:33,399
Optional challenge, let's go.

2166
04:11:33,399 --> 04:11:36,959
Only one piece of film, that's fine.

2167
04:11:36,959 --> 04:12:25,190
I don't need it.

2168
04:12:25,190 --> 04:12:36,909
I have an idea.

2169
04:12:36,909 --> 04:12:41,969
Just stagger it.

2170
04:12:41,969 --> 04:12:59,129
See what I mean?

2171
04:12:59,129 --> 04:13:03,780
Oh, I get a better picture.

2172
04:13:03,780 --> 04:13:05,860
I need a lot less of the outside.

2173
04:13:05,860 --> 04:13:27,040
There we go.

2174
04:13:27,040 --> 04:13:27,879
That's definitely what I have to do.

2175
04:13:27,879 --> 04:13:38,120
I just not, I gotta get it right.

2176
04:13:38,120 --> 04:13:43,879
Kind of better, kind of.

2177
04:13:43,920 --> 04:13:58,379
I don't know if I can jump to here though.

2178
04:13:58,379 --> 04:14:19,430
Damn it.

2179
04:14:19,430 --> 04:14:21,110
Can you please play a soap cutting video?

2180
04:14:21,110 --> 04:14:39,280
No, get out of here.

2181
04:14:39,280 --> 04:14:59,329
I got the right idea, it's just not the right execution.

2182
04:14:59,329 --> 04:15:01,690
Jumping?

2183
04:15:01,690 --> 04:15:03,559
That looks pretty good.

2184
04:15:03,559 --> 04:15:06,909
That looks kind of good.

2185
04:15:06,909 --> 04:15:09,350
Oh, that is close.

2186
04:15:09,350 --> 04:15:24,389
It's gonna be really close.

2187
04:15:24,389 --> 04:15:25,510
So close, but so far.

2188
04:15:25,510 --> 04:15:53,540
Maybe, is that it?

2189
04:15:53,540 --> 04:16:02,979
Oh, it's so close.

2190
04:16:02,979 --> 04:16:39,370
I think that might be it.

2191
04:16:39,370 --> 04:16:43,959
I'm trying to catch the last pixel.

2192
04:16:43,959 --> 04:16:44,799
Damn it.

2193
04:16:44,799 --> 04:16:56,290
That's the right call though.

2194
04:16:56,290 --> 04:17:03,239
That sounded like Arnold.

2195
04:17:04,200 --> 04:17:05,340
Wow.

2196
04:17:05,340 --> 04:17:13,799
Wow.

2197
04:17:13,799 --> 04:17:16,719
I'm so fucking close.

2198
04:17:16,719 --> 04:17:56,430
That could be the one.

2199
04:17:56,430 --> 04:17:59,840
Ooh, this could be it.

2200
04:17:59,840 --> 04:18:02,909
It could be.

2201
04:18:02,909 --> 04:18:08,719
Damn it.

2202
04:18:08,719 --> 04:18:37,120
Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

2203
04:18:37,120 --> 04:18:41,649
There it is.

2204
04:18:41,649 --> 04:18:52,850
I got a new filter, rainbow filter.

2205
04:18:52,850 --> 04:18:57,430
Wow, that's kind of wacky.

2206
04:18:57,430 --> 04:18:59,079
Looks like the negative.

2207
04:18:59,079 --> 04:19:00,440
I'll try it.

2208
04:19:00,440 --> 04:19:14,639
I'll try it for once.

2209
04:19:14,639 --> 04:19:16,280
All optional content completed.

2210
04:19:16,280 --> 04:19:28,700
Let's try this one.

2211
04:19:28,700 --> 04:19:41,680
Spill.

2212
04:19:41,680 --> 04:19:46,600
There's no other photos here, right?

2213
04:19:46,600 --> 04:19:49,899
I think we're getting to the end of the game.

2214
04:19:49,940 --> 04:19:50,780
One more section.

2215
04:19:50,780 --> 04:19:59,739
I wonder if it's, how long it is.

2216
04:19:59,739 --> 04:20:01,799
It's one of these.

2217
04:20:01,799 --> 04:20:04,250
It's one of these where I have to go

2218
04:20:04,250 --> 04:20:07,959
like three different ways.

2219
04:20:07,959 --> 04:20:12,719
Okay, I see the teleporter.

2220
04:20:12,719 --> 04:20:31,219
All right, well, that's not gonna work, is it?

2221
04:20:31,219 --> 04:20:33,520
How many does it need?

2222
04:20:33,520 --> 04:20:46,319
One or I can't tell.

2223
04:20:46,319 --> 04:21:21,129
It might just be one.

2224
04:21:21,129 --> 04:21:21,969
Is it one?

2225
04:21:21,969 --> 04:21:23,250
I hope it's one and not two.

2226
04:21:23,250 --> 04:21:26,049
If it's two, then I'm in trouble.

2227
04:21:26,049 --> 04:21:32,809
If it's one, I got it right here.

2228
04:21:32,809 --> 04:21:34,319
It is one.

2229
04:21:34,319 --> 04:21:39,139
That was the first try.

2230
04:21:39,139 --> 04:21:46,520
Photocopy?

2231
04:21:46,520 --> 04:21:49,069
What does that look like?

2232
04:21:49,069 --> 04:21:50,600
Nope.

2233
04:21:50,600 --> 04:21:52,639
Stay on this one for now.

2234
04:21:52,639 --> 04:21:59,500
I feel like we didn't get a chance to see it.

2235
04:22:00,500 --> 04:22:08,440
This game is really good.

2236
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:11,860
It's just really, the puzzles are hard,

2237
04:22:11,860 --> 04:22:16,200
but they're not too hard.

2238
04:22:16,200 --> 04:22:21,510
Did I do them all?

2239
04:22:21,510 --> 04:22:26,600
No, one more.

2240
04:22:26,600 --> 04:22:29,540
Optional.

2241
04:22:29,540 --> 04:22:33,319
Okay, there's one more optional.

2242
04:22:33,319 --> 04:22:39,590
And then there are two.

2243
04:22:39,590 --> 04:22:41,030
All right, there's one more regular level,

2244
04:22:41,030 --> 04:22:43,639
and then there's two optionals.

2245
04:22:43,639 --> 04:22:49,639
Let's try this one.

2246
04:22:49,639 --> 04:22:53,250
All right, they've introduced weight.

2247
04:22:53,250 --> 04:22:59,799
I don't have the camera.

2248
04:22:59,799 --> 04:23:01,719
All right, so I'm gonna take a picture of,

2249
04:23:01,719 --> 04:23:04,719
okay, I'm gonna take a picture of the watermelon.

2250
04:23:04,719 --> 04:23:20,389
Seems easy enough.

2251
04:23:20,389 --> 04:23:50,959
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

2252
04:23:50,959 --> 04:23:53,299
Why can't I look through this?

2253
04:23:53,299 --> 04:23:57,629
That's kind of weird, right?

2254
04:23:57,629 --> 04:24:05,079
Oh, just stand on it.

2255
04:24:05,079 --> 04:24:14,040
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

2256
04:24:14,040 --> 04:24:18,510
I did not want to go all the way back.

2257
04:24:18,510 --> 04:24:41,729
Hmm.

2258
04:24:41,729 --> 04:24:42,690
Can I just throw it?

2259
04:25:00,979 --> 04:25:01,860
Does this take a picture?

2260
04:25:01,860 --> 04:25:03,319
Wait, what is this?

2261
04:25:03,319 --> 04:25:04,639
I don't think this takes a picture of anything.

2262
04:25:04,639 --> 04:25:09,170
Yeah, because it's all, yeah.

2263
04:25:09,170 --> 04:25:19,229
But wait, can I get over here?

2264
04:25:19,229 --> 04:25:24,079
Damn it.

2265
04:25:24,079 --> 04:25:25,120
What do I do?

2266
04:25:25,120 --> 04:26:26,569
Shit.

2267
04:26:26,569 --> 04:26:39,909
Oh, my melon!

2268
04:26:39,909 --> 04:26:42,079
I don't have the camera,

2269
04:26:42,079 --> 04:26:43,440
so I can't take a picture of the melon.

2270
04:26:44,319 --> 04:26:48,500
Wait, can I stuff it in here?

2271
04:26:48,500 --> 04:26:49,340
What's this hole here for?

2272
04:26:49,340 --> 04:26:50,620
This hole is weird.

2273
04:26:50,620 --> 04:26:53,799
Oh, my God.

2274
04:26:53,799 --> 04:26:55,809
This is a weird hole.

2275
04:26:55,809 --> 04:26:57,590
That's a weird hole, isn't it?

2276
04:26:57,590 --> 04:26:59,920
It's perfectly for a melon.

2277
04:26:59,920 --> 04:27:24,200
That is a perfect hole for a melon.

2278
04:27:24,200 --> 04:28:02,120
Hmm, I wonder.

2279
04:28:02,120 --> 04:28:09,000
I got an idea.

2280
04:28:09,000 --> 04:28:09,840
Here it is.

2281
04:28:09,840 --> 04:28:14,680
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2282
04:28:14,680 --> 04:28:31,680
This is gonna be wacky.

2283
04:28:31,680 --> 04:28:37,809
Can I stand on something?

2284
04:28:37,809 --> 04:28:38,649
I can't move anything over there.

2285
04:28:38,649 --> 04:28:51,719
I can't stand on something.

2286
04:28:51,719 --> 04:28:53,559
Can I activate the camera through the ball here?

2287
04:28:53,559 --> 04:28:54,399
Like if I jump off?

2288
04:28:54,440 --> 04:29:32,879
No, there's no way to hit that button.

2289
04:29:32,879 --> 04:29:51,549
Fuck you, game.

2290
04:29:51,549 --> 04:30:07,399
I cheated.

2291
04:30:07,399 --> 04:30:11,489
We know.

2292
04:30:11,489 --> 04:30:13,770
I saw somebody, okay, I was moving over

2293
04:30:13,770 --> 04:30:16,760
and I see somebody say, cut the watermelon.

2294
04:30:16,760 --> 04:30:17,879
I was like, what are they talking about?

2295
04:30:17,879 --> 04:30:19,000
And then I realized I took the picture

2296
04:30:19,000 --> 04:30:21,479
and I was like, that's how you cut the watermelon.

2297
04:30:21,479 --> 04:30:23,200
So I half cheated.

2298
04:30:23,200 --> 04:30:28,920
I didn't know how to do it until it was too late.

2299
04:30:28,920 --> 04:30:31,319
So I half cheated.

2300
04:30:31,319 --> 04:30:33,809
That's not even enough.

2301
04:30:33,809 --> 04:30:34,649
Yeah, I got it.

2302
04:30:34,649 --> 04:30:52,500
Okay, I get it, I get it.

2303
04:30:52,500 --> 04:30:53,500
Interesting.

2304
04:30:53,500 --> 04:31:01,950
That's funny.

2305
04:31:01,950 --> 04:31:19,510
Please repent.

2306
04:31:19,510 --> 04:31:45,250
You need to eat a watermelon on stream to repent.

2307
04:31:45,250 --> 04:31:51,479
Hey, new camera filter, watermelon filter?

2308
04:31:51,479 --> 04:31:54,040
What does that look like?

2309
04:31:54,040 --> 04:32:05,100
I have to know.

2310
04:32:05,100 --> 04:32:17,899
Yeah, all right, it's expensive,

2311
04:32:17,899 --> 04:32:21,799
but let me tell you something.

2312
04:32:21,799 --> 04:32:24,959
The best juice, the best fruit juice

2313
04:32:24,959 --> 04:32:30,379
you can possibly purchase, and I mean it.

2314
04:32:30,379 --> 04:32:35,370
Have you guys ever had evolution juice?

2315
04:32:35,370 --> 04:32:37,889
Evolution watermelon juice or evolution orange juice

2316
04:32:37,889 --> 04:32:41,120
is nothing compares.

2317
04:32:41,120 --> 04:32:45,829
Absolutely nothing compares.

2318
04:32:45,829 --> 04:32:48,979
Absolutely nothing can ever compare.

2319
04:32:48,979 --> 04:32:50,340
A whole lot of no's.

2320
04:32:50,340 --> 04:32:53,680
Really?

2321
04:32:53,680 --> 04:32:54,520
Never heard of it.

2322
04:32:54,520 --> 04:33:02,090
Has anybody heard of it?

2323
04:33:02,090 --> 04:33:03,329
You know where you sometimes will see it?

2324
04:33:03,329 --> 04:33:05,209
You'll see it in Starbucks.

2325
04:33:05,209 --> 04:33:12,000
Starbucks sometimes has them on the rack.

2326
04:33:12,000 --> 04:33:21,090
Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

2327
04:33:21,090 --> 04:33:22,569
Does nobody know this?

2328
04:33:22,569 --> 04:33:32,349
How does nobody know this?

2329
04:33:32,349 --> 04:33:33,549
I've seen this across the country.

2330
04:33:33,549 --> 04:33:40,650
It's not just in Vegas.

2331
04:33:40,650 --> 04:33:41,689
Nice hallucination.

2332
04:33:41,689 --> 04:33:49,400
No, I'm telling you, it's life changing.

2333
04:33:49,400 --> 04:33:55,220
Now, evolution, evolution juice brand.

2334
04:33:55,220 --> 04:33:58,819
It's expensive.

2335
04:33:58,819 --> 04:34:01,540
It's a cold pressed juice.

2336
04:34:01,540 --> 04:34:07,229
Their orange juice, it goes absolutely nuts.

2337
04:34:07,229 --> 04:34:10,840
It's the kind, okay, so when you see it on the shelf,

2338
04:34:10,840 --> 04:34:13,880
it's half of it, like all the orange

2339
04:34:13,880 --> 04:34:20,340
is settled to the bottom half.

2340
04:34:20,340 --> 04:34:22,979
And then all the top is like a clear liquid

2341
04:34:22,979 --> 04:34:24,419
and you have to really shake it up.

2342
04:34:24,419 --> 04:34:31,840
This shit is fucking unbelievable.

2343
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:34,080
I don't buy it that often, but when I do,

2344
04:34:35,159 --> 04:34:39,159
and they have a watermelon, oh man.

2345
04:34:39,159 --> 04:34:40,240
It's no, it's not pulp.

2346
04:34:40,240 --> 04:34:41,080
It's not pulp.

2347
04:34:45,650 --> 04:34:48,840
But no, it is kind of pulpy because it's,

2348
04:34:48,840 --> 04:34:50,119
you know, it's the real shit.

2349
04:34:50,119 --> 04:34:53,349
No one's had this.

2350
04:34:54,849 --> 04:34:59,569
There's such an unbelievable orange aftertaste

2351
04:34:59,569 --> 04:35:04,139
that tastes like a real orange.

2352
04:35:04,139 --> 04:35:05,340
They sell this shit in Starbucks.

2353
04:35:05,340 --> 04:35:15,200
It's not shit, it's delicious.

2354
04:35:15,200 --> 04:35:19,680
How much, okay, how much is a large,

2355
04:35:19,680 --> 04:35:22,639
like 32 or like 20, like a big jug of orange juice?

2356
04:35:22,639 --> 04:35:27,759
Like how much is it now?

2357
04:35:27,759 --> 04:35:34,779
Six bucks, seven bucks?

2358
04:35:34,779 --> 04:35:40,590
So this one is like nine to $10 per jug.

2359
04:35:40,590 --> 04:35:44,159
Six or seven, yeah, that's usually what it is.

2360
04:35:44,159 --> 04:35:48,099
But let me tell you, if you have an opportunity to try it,

2361
04:35:48,099 --> 04:35:50,099
it's gonna ruin everything for you.

2362
04:35:50,099 --> 04:35:51,180
It's gonna ruin everything for you.

2363
04:35:51,180 --> 04:36:00,040
It's gonna ruin everything.

2364
04:36:00,040 --> 04:36:01,040
How big of a jug?

2365
04:36:03,700 --> 04:36:06,159
I think it's 32.

2366
04:36:06,159 --> 04:36:07,000
I think it's 32 ounces.

2367
04:36:07,000 --> 04:36:25,750
It might be more than that.

2368
04:36:25,750 --> 04:36:28,310
$11 for, actually, I think that is accurate.

2369
04:36:28,310 --> 04:36:29,189
Let me, hold on a second.

2370
04:36:29,189 --> 04:36:30,470
Give me one sec, I wanna look.

2371
04:36:30,470 --> 04:36:31,750
Actually, I own one right now.

2372
04:36:31,750 --> 04:36:34,119
I saw it and I was like, holy shit, I need this.

2373
04:36:34,119 --> 04:36:36,229
Give me one second.

2374
04:36:36,229 --> 04:37:32,459
I'll give you the exact ounce, the exact ounceage.

2375
04:37:32,459 --> 04:37:34,020
God, I just slammed a bunch of it too.

2376
04:37:34,020 --> 04:37:35,299
I just ripped it out of the fridge

2377
04:37:35,299 --> 04:37:37,520
and just started chugging it.

2378
04:37:38,279 --> 04:37:42,470
It's 59 ounces and I believe it was $11.

2379
04:37:42,470 --> 04:37:51,650
So it's about 60 ounces.

2380
04:37:51,650 --> 04:37:56,970
So that's about, you know, 60 ounces, yeah, 59 ounces.

2381
04:37:56,970 --> 04:38:06,610
No, I didn't drink 60 ounces.

2382
04:38:06,610 --> 04:38:08,330
So it's 59 ounces.

2383
04:38:08,330 --> 04:38:10,090
It was about 10, 11 bucks.

2384
04:38:10,090 --> 04:38:11,009
Maybe you can get it cheaper.

2385
04:38:11,009 --> 04:38:17,830
Maybe it's more expensive somewhere else.

2386
04:38:17,830 --> 04:38:22,930
The orange juice and the watermelon juice.

2387
04:38:22,930 --> 04:38:25,759
I think they make like, oh, there's vitamins in this one.

2388
04:38:25,759 --> 04:38:27,000
I don't get any of that.

2389
04:38:27,000 --> 04:38:37,979
I just get the straight up juice.

2390
04:38:37,979 --> 04:38:41,840
But I don't see it that often.

2391
04:38:41,840 --> 04:38:44,400
When I do see it, like my eyes just lasers

2392
04:38:44,400 --> 04:38:45,240
just shoot out at it.

2393
04:38:45,240 --> 04:39:02,909
Like, it's the one with the cursive logo, yes.

2394
04:39:02,909 --> 04:39:07,869
But this is the kind of juice that you sip this.

2395
04:39:07,869 --> 04:39:12,000
I cannot work with that.

2396
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:15,279
You sip this like it's a fine wine.

2397
04:39:15,279 --> 04:39:25,750
I just, I just told you I slammed it.

2398
04:39:35,560 --> 04:39:44,500
Yeah, it's all right.

2399
04:39:44,500 --> 04:39:51,639
Okay, I need, where's the, where is it?

2400
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:04,619
It's really good.

2401
04:40:04,659 --> 04:40:07,220
You know, if there's one thing that you can tell,

2402
04:40:07,220 --> 04:40:09,819
okay, if there's one thing that you know about me

2403
04:40:09,819 --> 04:40:12,060
and this stream and everything about this,

2404
04:40:12,060 --> 04:40:13,979
I don't mess around when it comes to food brands

2405
04:40:13,979 --> 04:40:15,729
that I like.

2406
04:40:15,729 --> 04:40:18,770
Have I steered you wrong before?

2407
04:40:18,770 --> 04:40:20,729
Have I steered you wrong before?

2408
04:40:20,729 --> 04:40:25,729
I do not mess around when it comes to foods and beverages.

2409
04:40:26,490 --> 04:40:38,750
I don't screw around.

2410
04:40:38,750 --> 04:40:42,630
I recommend only the finest products,

2411
04:40:42,630 --> 04:40:45,549
only the most delicious beverages, only the best.

2412
04:40:45,950 --> 04:40:49,590
Dr. Oetker's sucks.

2413
04:40:49,590 --> 04:40:50,470
That is one of the most,

2414
04:40:50,470 --> 04:40:52,590
that is one of the finest frozen pizzas.

2415
04:40:52,590 --> 04:40:54,389
I don't even know if they make it anymore.

2416
04:40:54,389 --> 04:41:00,270
But no, no, no, it does not.

2417
04:41:00,270 --> 04:41:02,709
I've never steered you wrong.

2418
04:41:02,709 --> 04:41:04,909
I believe everything I've said

2419
04:41:04,909 --> 04:41:09,400
about different beverages and foods.

2420
04:41:09,400 --> 04:41:11,610
Fuck the cheesy gordita crunch.

2421
04:41:11,610 --> 04:41:21,970
That actually might constitute a ban in this channel.

2422
04:41:21,970 --> 04:41:23,409
Do you think that that's, I mean,

2423
04:41:23,409 --> 04:41:37,040
that really might constitute a real, like, permanent ban.

2424
04:41:37,040 --> 04:41:43,250
How do I, what am I doing here?

2425
04:41:43,250 --> 04:41:45,840
What about McDonald's?

2426
04:41:45,840 --> 04:41:50,529
Yeah, I love my McDonald's order.

2427
04:41:50,529 --> 04:41:57,470
It's two double cheeseburgers, no pickle,

2428
04:41:57,470 --> 04:42:01,380
one McChicken, not spicy McChicken,

2429
04:42:01,380 --> 04:42:03,939
but sometimes you can't find that anymore,

2430
04:42:03,939 --> 04:42:08,810
and then a 10-piece nugget, meal, so you get the drink,

2431
04:42:08,810 --> 04:42:12,610
and then those nuggets are to be shared with the group.

2432
04:42:12,610 --> 04:42:15,650
Not, that's not the old, like, two or three years ago

2433
04:42:15,650 --> 04:42:18,500
when me and Ludwig were talking about it.

2434
04:42:18,500 --> 04:42:21,700
No, that, two double cheeseburgers, one McChicken,

2435
04:42:21,700 --> 04:42:24,659
and then nuggets for the table.

2436
04:42:24,659 --> 04:42:26,020
Sometimes I don't even eat those nuggets.

2437
04:42:26,020 --> 04:42:31,669
It's just like, hey, they're here.

2438
04:42:31,669 --> 04:42:33,669
No pickles, no, I don't like pickles on.

2439
04:42:39,880 --> 04:42:47,520
Three burgers, holy shit.

2440
04:42:47,520 --> 04:42:53,750
They're not, a McChicken is pretty small.

2441
04:42:53,750 --> 04:42:55,560
No fries?

2442
04:42:55,560 --> 04:43:02,779
No, you, the fries come with the McNuggets.

2443
04:43:02,779 --> 04:43:05,180
And I might, I don't really eat the nuggets.

2444
04:43:05,180 --> 04:43:07,099
It's just like, I get them because,

2445
04:43:07,099 --> 04:43:08,619
here's the thing about nuggets.

2446
04:43:08,619 --> 04:43:12,470
A lot of times, people don't want to order them.

2447
04:43:12,470 --> 04:43:15,349
Like, oh, yeah, I could get nuggets, but mm.

2448
04:43:15,349 --> 04:43:19,330
It's like, don't worry, I got you, I got you covered.

2449
04:43:19,330 --> 04:43:20,169
I'm gonna get them,

2450
04:43:20,169 --> 04:43:22,799
and we can all just share out of the box, fine.

2451
04:43:22,799 --> 04:43:24,849
I got you, I got you.

2452
04:43:24,849 --> 04:43:26,349
They always get eaten.

2453
04:43:26,349 --> 04:43:35,759
They're always eaten, all of them.

2454
04:43:35,759 --> 04:43:37,720
I don't eat all of it.

2455
04:43:37,720 --> 04:43:38,959
There's been a misconception

2456
04:43:38,959 --> 04:43:42,799
that I eat every single thing in that order.

2457
04:43:42,799 --> 04:43:44,799
And here's, listen to me.

2458
04:43:44,799 --> 04:43:51,270
If there is no group, if there is no group,

2459
04:43:51,270 --> 04:43:55,189
a McChicken is deleted, a Double Cheeseburger is deleted,

2460
04:43:55,189 --> 04:43:57,970
and it's a 10-piece nugget meal

2461
04:43:57,970 --> 04:44:11,220
and a Double Cheeseburger for the Powerade, that's it.

2462
04:44:11,220 --> 04:44:19,080
Why did I just take a picture of this?

2463
04:44:19,080 --> 04:44:30,909
All right, where am I, where am I going?

2464
04:44:30,909 --> 04:44:33,189
It's over there.

2465
04:44:33,189 --> 04:44:34,549
I need to, I need to look,

2466
04:44:34,549 --> 04:44:51,669
see what the hell's going on here.

2467
04:44:51,669 --> 04:45:01,529
Get me, okay.

2468
04:45:01,529 --> 04:45:14,709
I need to dispense this, like, pissing me off so bad.

2469
04:45:26,659 --> 04:45:37,439
There we go.

2470
04:45:37,439 --> 04:45:38,639
Okay, so what did we learn?

2471
04:45:38,639 --> 04:45:39,479
We learned a few things.

2472
04:45:39,479 --> 04:45:49,650
We learned Evolution Juice is probably the best.

2473
04:45:49,650 --> 04:45:56,290
It's three, damn, okay, hold on.

2474
04:45:56,290 --> 04:46:20,659
Three.

2475
04:46:20,659 --> 04:46:24,450
Your order comes out to be about 2,000 calories.

2476
04:46:24,450 --> 04:46:25,689
How much is a Double Cheeseburger

2477
04:46:25,689 --> 04:46:27,569
for McDonald's with no pickle?

2478
04:46:27,569 --> 04:46:37,229
Just one Double Cheeseburger, what is it?

2479
04:46:37,229 --> 04:46:41,080
Just a Double Cheeseburger, it's 400.

2480
04:46:41,080 --> 04:46:52,360
That's four, eight, and then how much is a McChicken?

2481
04:46:52,360 --> 04:46:58,040
Standard McChicken, nothing on it.

2482
04:46:58,040 --> 04:47:01,520
350?

2483
04:47:01,520 --> 04:47:06,720
It's 1,100 calories.

2484
04:47:06,720 --> 04:47:21,330
This level's too hard.

2485
04:47:21,330 --> 04:47:22,650
What size drink?

2486
04:47:22,650 --> 04:47:28,220
I usually don't do, I don't really get,

2487
04:47:28,220 --> 04:47:29,869
here's what I'll do.

2488
04:47:29,869 --> 04:47:33,709
I'll get a Powerade and I'll just put it in the fridge.

2489
04:47:33,709 --> 04:47:35,189
I'll maybe take, like, a few sips out of it,

2490
04:47:35,189 --> 04:47:41,490
but I usually save most of it.

2491
04:47:41,490 --> 04:47:45,159
Hey, another voicemail.

2492
04:47:45,159 --> 04:47:48,400
It's getting harder and harder to reach you.

2493
04:47:48,400 --> 04:47:49,319
I hope you're doing well.

2494
04:47:49,319 --> 04:47:52,000
I am kind of a weird person,

2495
04:47:52,000 --> 04:47:54,479
and I know a lot of people are like this too,

2496
04:47:54,479 --> 04:47:57,119
so raise your hand if you're like this as well.

2497
04:47:57,119 --> 04:47:58,479
When I'm hungry and I eat,

2498
04:48:01,279 --> 04:48:05,310
I don't really drink a full drink.

2499
04:48:05,310 --> 04:48:11,110
I just kind of, I think a drink kind of fills you up a lot.

2500
04:48:11,110 --> 04:48:12,630
Sometimes I won't even take a sip of something

2501
04:48:12,630 --> 04:48:14,700
for a little while.

2502
04:48:14,700 --> 04:48:17,930
I used to be like that, yeah.

2503
04:48:17,930 --> 04:48:22,770
I think a lot more people do that than I think.

2504
04:48:22,770 --> 04:48:25,689
But obviously, like, I'm not just gonna wolf down food

2505
04:48:25,689 --> 04:48:28,130
without a drink, that's not good.

2506
04:48:28,130 --> 04:48:36,439
I'll take a sip or two maybe every so often.

2507
04:48:36,479 --> 04:48:39,360
A lot of people do that, yeah.

2508
04:48:39,360 --> 04:48:42,319
I think that's why I'm able to eat a little bit more food,

2509
04:48:42,319 --> 04:48:50,040
is because I'm not filling up with a big 32-ounce drink.

2510
04:48:50,040 --> 04:48:52,439
The drink is the first thing I finish.

2511
04:48:52,439 --> 04:48:59,119
See, that's super foreign to me.

2512
04:48:59,119 --> 04:49:00,759
And let me make this very clear.

2513
04:49:02,689 --> 04:49:07,569
This is a once-in-a-while delicacy.

2514
04:49:07,569 --> 04:49:10,689
I am not eating 1,100 calories,

2515
04:49:10,689 --> 04:49:15,439
1,200 calories of McDonald's every day.

2516
04:49:16,240 --> 04:49:19,919
This is like once in a while.

2517
04:49:19,919 --> 04:49:20,959
And hey, guess what?

2518
04:49:20,959 --> 04:49:23,040
I have some really bad news for you.

2519
04:49:23,040 --> 04:49:25,000
That large milkshake that you got

2520
04:49:25,000 --> 04:49:26,560
from the fucking ice cream store

2521
04:49:26,560 --> 04:49:31,159
is probably 1,400 calories.

2522
04:49:31,159 --> 04:49:39,630
So, hey, don't come charging at me.

2523
04:49:39,630 --> 04:49:40,549
This is weird.

2524
04:49:40,549 --> 04:49:44,930
All right, so I need one.

2525
04:49:44,930 --> 04:49:49,119
Okay, let's try to get this done.

2526
04:49:49,119 --> 04:49:50,720
Weird, okay.

2527
04:49:50,720 --> 04:49:51,880
Oh, goodness.

2528
04:49:55,159 --> 04:50:03,639
All right, so this one is, this one has color.

2529
04:50:03,880 --> 04:50:06,200
It's time for the ultimate poll.

2530
04:50:06,200 --> 04:50:07,479
The ultimate food poll.

2531
04:50:07,479 --> 04:50:08,680
You guys ready?

2532
04:50:08,680 --> 04:50:11,279
Let's do it.

2533
04:50:11,279 --> 04:50:16,279
How many scoops of ice cream would you consider to be?

2534
04:50:16,439 --> 04:50:17,279
That's good.

2535
04:50:17,279 --> 04:50:21,119
From, not from the freezer

2536
04:50:21,119 --> 04:50:22,639
where you're doing it on your own.

2537
04:50:22,639 --> 04:50:26,380
I'm talking about you're at an ice cream store.

2538
04:50:26,380 --> 04:50:27,380
And it's like, okay, here you go.

2539
04:50:27,380 --> 04:50:28,900
Here are the sizes.

2540
04:50:28,900 --> 04:50:30,740
It's one, two, three.

2541
04:50:30,740 --> 04:50:32,500
One, two, or three.

2542
04:50:32,500 --> 04:50:33,340
Which one is it?

2543
04:50:33,340 --> 04:50:34,180
I'm gonna give you the correct answer

2544
04:50:34,180 --> 04:51:00,090
when we're done doing the poll.

2545
04:51:00,090 --> 04:51:01,209
The correct answer.

2546
04:51:05,270 --> 04:51:06,950
Somebody said one.

2547
04:51:06,950 --> 04:51:17,380
I'm ashamed to say more than three in public.

2548
04:51:17,380 --> 04:51:25,009
Look at this.

2549
04:51:25,009 --> 04:51:34,119
That was not as hard as I thought it was gonna be.

2550
04:51:34,119 --> 04:51:36,200
Decentrist Andy, we already know this.

2551
04:51:36,200 --> 04:51:39,169
Well, that might not be correct.

2552
04:51:39,169 --> 04:51:42,840
Let's see.

2553
04:51:42,840 --> 04:51:46,970
Okay, very interesting.

2554
04:51:46,970 --> 04:51:49,639
The correct answer is one.

2555
04:51:49,639 --> 04:51:50,599
Correct answer is one.

2556
04:51:50,599 --> 04:51:55,740
I'm gonna give you the reason why.

2557
04:51:55,740 --> 04:52:00,720
I've gone to get an ice cream before.

2558
04:52:00,720 --> 04:52:03,520
And you go, you know, usually it's usually

2559
04:52:03,520 --> 04:52:06,619
at the, in the evening times.

2560
04:52:06,619 --> 04:52:09,819
And one scoop of ice cream from a place,

2561
04:52:09,819 --> 04:52:13,299
from a store is usually massive.

2562
04:52:13,299 --> 04:52:14,659
Massive.

2563
04:52:14,659 --> 04:52:18,029
To a point where I'll eat half of it.

2564
04:52:18,029 --> 04:52:19,830
I'll eat two thirds of it and be like,

2565
04:52:19,830 --> 04:52:24,930
oh, geez, I just can't do it anymore.

2566
04:52:24,930 --> 04:52:25,770
It really depends.

2567
04:52:25,770 --> 04:52:26,610
Yeah, somebody, that's a good point.

2568
04:52:26,610 --> 04:52:28,689
It really depends on where.

2569
04:52:28,689 --> 04:52:33,759
But most places really, really pile it on.

2570
04:52:33,759 --> 04:52:36,439
And I've even been to places where I go, yeah, yeah.

2571
04:52:36,439 --> 04:52:37,959
Can I, can I get one?

2572
04:52:37,959 --> 04:52:40,450
Just like the little, just small one.

2573
04:52:40,450 --> 04:52:45,450
And the worker is super nice and really, really wonderful.

2574
04:52:45,970 --> 04:52:48,169
And they're like, I got you, I got you, yep.

2575
04:52:48,169 --> 04:52:50,810
And they really just, they kind of give a little extra.

2576
04:52:50,810 --> 04:52:53,970
And it's just like, okay, all right, all right.

2577
04:52:53,970 --> 04:52:54,810
We're good, we're good.

2578
04:52:54,810 --> 04:52:57,799
Okay, that's all right.

2579
04:52:57,799 --> 04:53:03,830
It's like super nice.

2580
04:53:03,830 --> 04:53:10,279
I would like to order the little kid's,

2581
04:53:12,520 --> 04:53:16,040
I want like the smallest possible one.

2582
04:53:16,040 --> 04:53:18,240
Because after a while,

2583
04:53:18,240 --> 04:53:21,549
please raise your hand if you like this.

2584
04:53:21,549 --> 04:53:27,200
After like bite number 10 of an ice cream,

2585
04:53:27,200 --> 04:53:29,520
it sort of starts to get a little,

2586
04:53:29,520 --> 04:53:30,799
the flavor kind of goes away

2587
04:53:30,799 --> 04:53:34,259
and it kind of just becomes like milk to me.

2588
04:53:34,259 --> 04:53:37,360
It gets a little kind of heavy and,

2589
04:53:37,360 --> 04:53:41,380
not, yeah, bite, like you're eating a,

2590
04:53:41,540 --> 04:53:45,380
there was a communication breakdown.

2591
04:53:45,380 --> 04:53:48,659
There was a communication breakdown tonight.

2592
04:53:48,659 --> 04:53:57,159
There was a, oh shit, this is so funny.

2593
04:54:06,250 --> 04:54:12,240
I should have, I should have started like this.

2594
04:54:12,240 --> 04:54:14,599
I'm talking about in a cup, not,

2595
04:54:14,599 --> 04:54:16,840
I shouldn't, I'm not talking about an ice cream cone.

2596
04:54:16,840 --> 04:54:25,060
I'm talking about in a like cup with a spoon.

2597
04:54:25,060 --> 04:54:29,400
I probably should have made that a little clearer.

2598
04:54:29,400 --> 04:54:31,819
I just keep imagining just,

2599
04:54:31,819 --> 04:54:34,659
just taking big bites out of an ice cream.

2600
04:54:34,659 --> 04:54:37,840
You'd be like, holy shit, dude.

2601
04:54:37,840 --> 04:54:40,479
That's like, that's what like a dog would do.

2602
04:54:40,479 --> 04:54:42,560
Like stop, slow down.

2603
04:54:51,110 --> 04:54:54,939
Okay, so now that we have that clear,

2604
04:54:54,939 --> 04:54:59,849
when you get more than two scoops of ice cream in a cup,

2605
04:54:59,849 --> 04:55:04,840
it's, it just gets so heavy after a while.

2606
04:55:04,840 --> 04:55:06,240
I'm glad we could clear that up though.

2607
04:55:06,240 --> 04:55:08,299
Thanks for joining.

2608
04:55:08,299 --> 04:55:10,220
Magnificent athletic feet.

2609
04:55:10,220 --> 04:55:14,220
And with that's grace at that.

2610
04:55:14,220 --> 04:55:15,740
I just keep seeing somebody just be like,

2611
04:55:15,740 --> 04:55:16,819
oh, thanks, I appreciate it.

2612
04:55:16,819 --> 04:55:19,259
Like bite, bite, bite, bite.

2613
04:55:21,060 --> 04:55:21,939
I feel like I was going to be,

2614
04:55:21,939 --> 04:55:23,939
I feel like I was on like a prank video.

2615
04:55:23,939 --> 04:55:38,520
Like, what is this guy doing?

2616
04:55:38,520 --> 04:55:43,299
Okay, now here.

2617
04:55:43,299 --> 04:55:45,259
Yeah, there was a little communication breakdown there,

2618
04:55:45,259 --> 04:55:51,200
but that, that was, oh, that was funny.

2619
04:55:51,200 --> 04:55:54,159
That was so funny.

2620
04:55:54,159 --> 04:55:57,450
Oh man.

2621
04:55:57,450 --> 04:56:12,479
Back here.

2622
04:56:12,479 --> 04:56:16,689
You've done whatever's in this maze of memories

2623
04:56:17,409 --> 04:56:18,250
and forgotten wonder.

2624
04:56:18,250 --> 04:56:19,090
Did I win?

2625
04:56:19,090 --> 04:56:22,130
I hope your experience has been pleasant so far.

2626
04:56:22,130 --> 04:56:25,680
To me, it's been.

2627
04:56:25,680 --> 04:56:28,400
This is going to be awful.

2628
04:56:28,400 --> 04:56:34,169
Okay, so it's blue, blue.

2629
04:56:34,169 --> 04:56:35,369
What about the McRiddle?

2630
04:56:35,369 --> 04:56:39,319
See, the McRiddle is kind of where I draw the line

2631
04:56:39,319 --> 04:56:43,009
because I don't, it's not that I don't like the McRiddle,

2632
04:56:43,009 --> 04:56:45,689
but it's kind of too much for me.

2633
04:56:59,020 --> 04:57:00,659
All right, I need a minute to pay attention to this.

2634
04:57:00,659 --> 04:57:06,790
What's the point of me doing this by the way?

2635
04:57:06,790 --> 04:57:13,880
Yeah, why wouldn't I just,

2636
04:57:13,880 --> 04:57:24,909
it tastes really good.

2637
04:57:24,909 --> 04:57:28,349
I need to, give me a second.

2638
04:57:28,349 --> 04:57:30,630
Ooh, this just hurts.

2639
04:57:30,630 --> 04:57:31,470
This hurts.

2640
04:57:31,470 --> 04:57:34,709
Okay, I think I'm just going to skip the blue.

2641
04:57:46,180 --> 04:57:50,709
I don't have a camera or anything.

2642
04:57:50,709 --> 04:57:51,669
I mean, it's open right now.

2643
04:57:51,669 --> 04:58:04,240
Can I just, wait, yeah.

2644
04:58:04,240 --> 04:58:05,439
Is it changing?

2645
04:58:05,439 --> 04:58:15,759
It looks like it's changing.

2646
04:58:15,759 --> 04:58:26,880
Damn it.

2647
04:58:33,659 --> 04:58:34,900
This one is confusing me.

2648
04:58:34,900 --> 04:58:54,490
Well, am I missing something to do here?

2649
04:58:54,490 --> 04:58:56,450
I keep thinking of somebody just biting an ice cream,

2650
04:58:56,450 --> 04:58:58,689
like hard.

2651
04:58:59,369 --> 04:59:00,409
I feel like that would be so bad on your teeth.

2652
04:59:00,409 --> 04:59:03,310
I feel like my teeth would just, ugh.

2653
04:59:05,840 --> 04:59:12,049
It is a mobile game ad.

2654
04:59:12,049 --> 04:59:12,889
So what?

2655
04:59:12,889 --> 04:59:14,810
I guess, okay.

2656
04:59:14,810 --> 04:59:17,529
I think I understand.

2657
04:59:17,529 --> 04:59:20,650
If I go through blue, walk through blue, step on that,

2658
04:59:20,650 --> 04:59:27,990
go through, I don't, I don't, I don't get it.

2659
04:59:27,990 --> 04:59:33,650
Let's go through red.

2660
04:59:33,650 --> 04:59:35,569
They line up.

2661
04:59:35,569 --> 04:59:38,009
Yeah, but I mean,

2662
04:59:38,009 --> 04:59:40,569
why would I walk all the way over here to turn it red

2663
04:59:40,569 --> 04:59:44,680
to walk all the way that way?

2664
04:59:44,680 --> 04:59:47,919
What is this one even doing?

2665
04:59:48,279 --> 04:59:49,200
This one's not even taking down something.

2666
04:59:49,200 --> 04:59:50,040
What is it?

2667
04:59:50,040 --> 04:59:50,880
What is this doing?

2668
04:59:50,880 --> 04:59:57,590
Is it doing something?

2669
04:59:57,590 --> 05:00:20,080
What's the point of this one?

2670
05:00:20,080 --> 05:00:35,880
I'm going to just try this way and see what happens here.

2671
05:00:35,880 --> 05:00:37,279
You're changing the portals.

2672
05:00:37,279 --> 05:00:42,650
Red has always been over here.

2673
05:00:42,650 --> 05:00:45,229
Now that's blue.

2674
05:00:45,229 --> 05:00:48,430
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2675
05:00:48,430 --> 05:00:50,790
Ah, okay, okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2676
05:00:50,790 --> 05:00:53,639
All right, sorry, I was talking about ice cream and shit.

2677
05:00:53,639 --> 05:00:55,040
All right, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

2678
05:00:55,040 --> 05:00:56,000
All right, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2679
05:00:56,000 --> 05:00:58,599
I know exactly what, yeah, I got it, it's done.

2680
05:00:58,599 --> 05:01:01,680
I wasn't, yeah, I think,

2681
05:01:01,680 --> 05:01:03,040
I don't think anybody knew that was going on

2682
05:01:03,080 --> 05:01:14,139
except for one person.

2683
05:01:14,139 --> 05:01:15,099
What's this, what type of ice cream?

2684
05:01:15,099 --> 05:01:20,270
What's the, what's this for?

2685
05:01:20,270 --> 05:01:23,630
Soft serve, oh yeah, this is an easy one for me.

2686
05:01:23,630 --> 05:01:26,630
Isn't making it this far enough?

2687
05:01:26,630 --> 05:01:28,830
Haven't you gained all the knowledge

2688
05:01:28,830 --> 05:01:30,750
this place has to offer?

2689
05:01:30,750 --> 05:01:32,630
This was our life's work,

2690
05:01:32,630 --> 05:01:43,840
and it's meaningful the way you want these.

2691
05:01:43,840 --> 05:01:45,599
This is the big reveal.

2692
05:01:45,599 --> 05:01:57,419
That, wait, aren't I still in the simulation?

2693
05:01:57,419 --> 05:01:59,659
Scoop, I believe, is the correct answer.

2694
05:01:59,659 --> 05:02:04,200
Scoop is correct with one,

2695
05:02:04,200 --> 05:02:07,619
one thing that takes that completely out of the way.

2696
05:02:07,619 --> 05:02:14,560
Soft serve with a cherry dip is unbeatable no matter what.

2697
05:02:16,709 --> 05:02:21,169
Cherry dip, vanilla cherry dip is,

2698
05:02:21,169 --> 05:02:30,220
with a soft serve, nothing will ever compare, ever.

2699
05:02:30,220 --> 05:02:34,360
They do, like chocolate dip too is good as well.

2700
05:02:34,360 --> 05:02:37,080
I think cherry dip soft serve is just S plus,

2701
05:02:37,080 --> 05:02:42,439
and even the best S hard ice cream is below cherry dip.

2702
05:02:45,330 --> 05:02:47,319
You never had a cherry dip before?

2703
05:02:47,319 --> 05:02:50,500
Uh, Dairy Queen used to do it.

2704
05:02:50,500 --> 05:02:53,130
Is Dairy Queen still doing?

2705
05:02:53,130 --> 05:02:55,720
That's where you can get it.

2706
05:02:55,720 --> 05:02:56,560
It didn't work.

2707
05:02:56,560 --> 05:02:57,650
It's really good.

2708
05:02:57,650 --> 05:03:02,889
It never, it wasn't supposed to happen like this.

2709
05:03:02,889 --> 05:03:04,810
I feel like we need to pay attention right now.

2710
05:03:04,810 --> 05:03:18,680
They were all supposed to find the answer.

2711
05:03:18,680 --> 05:03:24,500
Hmm?

2712
05:03:24,500 --> 05:03:26,939
This, this isn't it, it can't be.

2713
05:03:26,939 --> 05:03:29,220
The solution, it all made sense.

2714
05:03:29,220 --> 05:03:31,139
The formula, the structure,

2715
05:03:31,139 --> 05:03:33,540
this should have solved all our problems.

2716
05:03:33,540 --> 05:03:35,020
This should have been the answer.

2717
05:03:35,020 --> 05:03:37,220
I need this to be the answer.

2718
05:03:37,220 --> 05:03:38,060
Why?

2719
05:03:38,060 --> 05:03:39,740
Why isn't this working?

2720
05:03:39,740 --> 05:03:55,200
I, I can't give up.

2721
05:03:55,200 --> 05:03:57,150
I'm sorry.

2722
05:03:57,150 --> 05:03:58,950
When I realized what you were looking for,

2723
05:03:58,950 --> 05:04:02,430
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

2724
05:04:02,430 --> 05:04:07,159
An impossible solution for an impossible question.

2725
05:04:07,159 --> 05:04:10,200
Mirren was, she was crushed.

2726
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:11,520
They all were.

2727
05:04:11,520 --> 05:04:16,240
I didn't want you to have to, to feel as they felt.

2728
05:04:16,240 --> 05:04:19,000
It's a painful burden, knowing.

2729
05:04:20,159 --> 05:04:21,119
Twist is good too.

2730
05:04:21,119 --> 05:04:22,080
Soft serve twist.

2731
05:04:25,220 --> 05:04:28,150
Honestly, I'm not sure I could really pick,

2732
05:04:28,150 --> 05:04:34,090
you know, hard scoop ice cream is better than soft serve.

2733
05:04:34,090 --> 05:04:36,130
That's like a ketchup versus mustard fight.

2734
05:04:36,130 --> 05:04:47,470
I don't think I'm going to crown a winner there.

2735
05:04:47,470 --> 05:04:49,810
He does not care.

2736
05:04:49,810 --> 05:04:51,939
What, what, what happened?

2737
05:04:51,939 --> 05:04:55,380
Did something really like bad happen?

2738
05:04:55,380 --> 05:04:56,900
Oh, what did I, what did I happen?

2739
05:04:56,900 --> 05:05:07,060
What did I do?

2740
05:05:07,060 --> 05:05:08,659
Oh, I don't know what happened,

2741
05:05:08,659 --> 05:05:19,189
but I'm sorry.

2742
05:05:19,189 --> 05:05:23,669
I didn't, I didn't mean, I'm keeping it on watermelon.

2743
05:05:23,669 --> 05:05:33,220
No, I wanted to be, that's the last part of the game.

2744
05:05:33,220 --> 05:05:42,430
This is it, the final chapter.

2745
05:05:42,430 --> 05:05:44,590
Mustard is disgusting and you should feel disgusting

2746
05:05:44,590 --> 05:05:47,319
for liking it.

2747
05:05:47,319 --> 05:05:49,959
Oh, should we tell him about honey mustard

2748
05:05:49,959 --> 05:05:57,200
and how that, it's just sad that that opinion is,

2749
05:05:57,200 --> 05:06:02,590
that's, if honey mustard is existing,

2750
05:06:02,590 --> 05:06:08,639
just makes it hard for me to agree with that.

2751
05:06:08,680 --> 05:06:11,080
A good stone ground mustard with honey mustard.

2752
05:06:11,080 --> 05:06:14,000
Oh, ketchup is good too.

2753
05:06:14,000 --> 05:06:15,720
I don't love ketchup on a lot of things,

2754
05:06:15,720 --> 05:06:25,400
but the things I do like it on, I love it.

2755
05:06:25,400 --> 05:06:26,240
But it's home.

2756
05:06:26,240 --> 05:06:29,959
Honestly, mustard is way more versatile than ketchup.

2757
05:06:29,959 --> 05:06:31,840
Ketchup is just kind of ketchup and it's just ketchup.

2758
05:06:31,840 --> 05:06:33,279
You know what you're getting and it's very classic

2759
05:06:33,279 --> 05:06:34,360
and it's good.

2760
05:06:34,360 --> 05:06:38,549
But there are dozens of varieties of mustard.

2761
05:06:38,549 --> 05:06:41,909
You can turn it into completely different things.

2762
05:06:41,909 --> 05:06:44,990
Now you can put like, you know, a hot sauce in ketchup

2763
05:06:44,990 --> 05:06:47,310
and you can change ketchup a little,

2764
05:06:47,310 --> 05:06:52,270
but I think it's, mustard has changed almost completely

2765
05:06:52,270 --> 05:06:57,139
when you add things to it.

2766
05:06:57,139 --> 05:07:02,459
All right, let's go for it.

2767
05:07:02,459 --> 05:07:03,419
What do we got?

2768
05:07:03,419 --> 05:07:18,360
Final chapter.

2769
05:07:18,360 --> 05:07:24,750
Everything's kind of floating around.

2770
05:07:24,750 --> 05:07:31,889
I have a feeling I'm gonna have to touch some stuff,

2771
05:07:31,889 --> 05:07:34,919
but pastrami sandwich with mustard on it,

2772
05:07:34,919 --> 05:07:39,790
slice of cheese, the mustard makes the whole thing.

2773
05:07:49,349 --> 05:07:53,189
Camera over here.

2774
05:07:53,189 --> 05:07:54,509
All right, are you just hungry?

2775
05:07:54,509 --> 05:07:57,430
I think I'm just hungry every time I stream

2776
05:07:57,430 --> 05:07:58,669
because I don't eat on stream.

2777
05:07:58,669 --> 05:08:02,099
I think I've figured out the formula, guys.

2778
05:08:02,779 --> 05:08:05,060
I don't eat on stream and sometimes I'm live, you know,

2779
05:08:05,060 --> 05:08:06,819
for four or five, six straight hours

2780
05:08:06,819 --> 05:08:08,340
and I just, I'm not eating on stream.

2781
05:08:08,340 --> 05:08:10,500
So I just, I'm thinking about the delicious foods

2782
05:08:10,500 --> 05:08:20,759
that I would like to have.

2783
05:08:20,759 --> 05:08:35,270
Okay, so I don't have a camera.

2784
05:08:35,270 --> 05:08:37,509
Can I take, all right, I think I can take this.

2785
05:08:37,509 --> 05:08:38,509
All right, I got it.

2786
05:08:47,509 --> 05:09:00,619
This will delete the fence, right?

2787
05:09:00,619 --> 05:09:19,799
Wait, this is taking a delayed photo.

2788
05:09:19,799 --> 05:09:22,549
Should I do anything about this?

2789
05:09:22,549 --> 05:09:30,380
There's a lot of photos in this thing.

2790
05:09:30,380 --> 05:09:48,560
Are we gonna get to see what it looked like?

2791
05:09:49,119 --> 05:09:50,000
So I'm imagining I can then,

2792
05:09:50,000 --> 05:09:52,939
can I teleport myself in here?

2793
05:09:52,939 --> 05:10:05,709
Now that's cool.

2794
05:10:05,709 --> 05:10:06,709
Where's this phone?

2795
05:10:17,680 --> 05:10:18,520
Can you hear me?

2796
05:10:27,080 --> 05:10:29,759
Ham and cheese, mustard in the toaster oven.

2797
05:10:31,200 --> 05:10:32,040
Oh yeah.

2798
05:10:42,159 --> 05:10:53,110
I think it was the, oh yeah, that just fucked me up.

2799
05:10:53,110 --> 05:10:54,950
All right, I won't talk about food anymore.

2800
05:10:54,950 --> 05:10:55,790
Let's go.

2801
05:10:57,720 --> 05:10:59,400
Oh, oh yeah.

2802
05:10:59,400 --> 05:11:00,240
Oh yeah.

2803
05:11:10,000 --> 05:11:10,840
Barcode.

2804
05:11:18,490 --> 05:11:34,360
Reserve it?

2805
05:11:34,360 --> 05:11:37,930
I'm not there.

2806
05:11:37,930 --> 05:11:45,740
Holy shit, that's, okay, that's cool.

2807
05:11:45,740 --> 05:11:51,779
Barcode forest.

2808
05:11:51,779 --> 05:11:54,099
Anything here I can grab or no?

2809
05:11:54,099 --> 05:12:05,340
I think it's just a cool thing to do.

2810
05:12:05,340 --> 05:12:29,150
Hmm, I'll just take a picture of this.

2811
05:12:29,150 --> 05:12:35,750
Now I have to teleport in here, so how do I get,

2812
05:12:35,750 --> 05:12:38,439
maybe I do just have to stand in the forest.

2813
05:12:38,439 --> 05:13:00,080
Will it see me in there?

2814
05:13:00,080 --> 05:13:13,000
Oh shit, I deleted it accidentally.

2815
05:13:13,000 --> 05:13:23,180
Why would I go in the, why would I do that?

2816
05:13:24,979 --> 05:13:30,090
How do I get out of here?

2817
05:13:30,090 --> 05:13:58,930
Forest, I can do it twice.

2818
05:13:58,930 --> 05:14:08,790
It's a lot easier than I was making it.

2819
05:14:08,790 --> 05:14:13,439
Okay, picture, let's take a,

2820
05:14:13,439 --> 05:14:36,150
I'm just gonna take six selfies.

2821
05:14:36,189 --> 05:14:44,759
I think that's, I don't need more than that.

2822
05:14:44,759 --> 05:14:46,799
Wait a minute.

2823
05:14:46,799 --> 05:15:00,529
How do I, how do I get out of here with the battery?

2824
05:15:00,529 --> 05:15:14,380
Hmm, okay.

2825
05:15:14,380 --> 05:15:28,939
So now, can I get out of here like this?

2826
05:15:28,939 --> 05:15:30,139
Oh, wait a minute.

2827
05:15:30,139 --> 05:15:50,169
Okay, got it.

2828
05:15:50,169 --> 05:15:53,909
Now, how do I get?

2829
05:15:53,909 --> 05:16:14,150
I know, and I don't have enough photos.

2830
05:16:14,150 --> 05:16:15,909
What if I'm holding the battery in my hands

2831
05:16:15,909 --> 05:16:17,470
during the picture?

2832
05:16:17,470 --> 05:16:29,680
I'm doing that.

2833
05:16:29,680 --> 05:16:45,860
Let's go take a look.

2834
05:16:45,860 --> 05:16:48,380
All right, I need to get over there.

2835
05:16:48,419 --> 05:16:52,360
There is no battery.

2836
05:16:52,360 --> 05:16:56,080
I have to eventually teleport over there.

2837
05:16:56,080 --> 05:16:58,880
And down here, it looks like bullshit.

2838
05:17:01,040 --> 05:17:06,180
It's a text.

2839
05:17:06,180 --> 05:17:11,810
Elevate the pollutant degradation system.

2840
05:17:11,810 --> 05:17:13,250
Geniuses.

2841
05:17:13,250 --> 05:17:15,450
Is as though our success are the result of a team effort.

2842
05:17:15,450 --> 05:17:18,659
Future is looking bright and I'm having a lot of fun.

2843
05:17:18,659 --> 05:17:22,299
Metabolic flux analysis of bio-coded specimen

2844
05:17:22,299 --> 05:17:25,490
makes for fascinating research.

2845
05:17:25,490 --> 05:17:41,040
All right, pick any of this up.

2846
05:17:41,040 --> 05:17:42,759
Okay, the camera is right here.

2847
05:17:42,759 --> 05:17:44,279
I don't have to jump.

2848
05:17:45,040 --> 05:17:48,040
I think I've jumped to getting it.

2849
05:17:48,040 --> 05:18:08,060
No, I don't.

2850
05:18:08,060 --> 05:18:20,439
I have to jump.

2851
05:18:20,439 --> 05:18:23,189
Did I get it?

2852
05:18:23,189 --> 05:18:41,209
Aha, I did it.

2853
05:18:41,209 --> 05:18:42,450
Listen to the megaphone.

2854
05:18:51,419 --> 05:18:55,349
Still wear those beads on your arm?

2855
05:18:55,349 --> 05:19:13,319
Talking about my crystals.

2856
05:19:13,319 --> 05:19:23,669
All right, do I need to?

2857
05:19:23,669 --> 05:19:26,349
Yeah, I had a black tourmaline bracelet on one day

2858
05:19:26,349 --> 05:19:29,750
and everybody thought I was like a healer or something.

2859
05:19:29,750 --> 05:19:55,610
And it's like, I just liked it.

2860
05:19:55,610 --> 05:20:10,680
I wonder if I do this.

2861
05:20:10,680 --> 05:20:13,209
And this will be kind of far away,

2862
05:20:13,250 --> 05:20:17,869
which means I can teleport up there.

2863
05:20:17,869 --> 05:20:21,849
Aha, yes.

2864
05:20:21,849 --> 05:20:35,299
This is to get it in the right spot.

2865
05:20:35,299 --> 05:20:38,700
This place, it's old now.

2866
05:20:38,700 --> 05:20:40,340
Fallen apart.

2867
05:20:40,340 --> 05:20:43,459
Data left alone for too long.

2868
05:20:43,459 --> 05:20:44,779
Corrupt.

2869
05:20:44,779 --> 05:20:46,740
Please, be mindful.

2870
05:20:51,130 --> 05:20:59,169
Only got two more levels left or two more areas.

2871
05:20:59,169 --> 05:21:02,939
What's the mechanic in this one?

2872
05:21:02,939 --> 05:21:11,439
Camera's back.

2873
05:21:11,439 --> 05:21:13,729
Weird.

2874
05:21:13,729 --> 05:21:19,509
Hiraia left.

2875
05:21:19,509 --> 05:21:20,349
These.

2876
05:21:20,349 --> 05:21:21,880
These.

2877
05:21:21,880 --> 05:21:24,990
If these have struck the light here,

2878
05:21:24,990 --> 05:21:26,590
something must be wrong with the camera.

2879
05:21:26,590 --> 05:21:28,150
Because I don't want to forget.

2880
05:21:28,150 --> 05:21:29,229
This is dangerous.

2881
05:21:29,229 --> 05:21:31,270
We came here to challenge wonders,

2882
05:21:31,270 --> 05:21:36,700
but now we are left.

2883
05:21:36,700 --> 05:21:38,880
Don't seem to fit together.

2884
05:21:38,880 --> 05:21:42,119
Perhaps our time will be better used out there

2885
05:21:42,119 --> 05:21:43,700
and in the world.

2886
05:21:43,700 --> 05:21:46,360
Hiraia must have felt.

2887
05:21:46,360 --> 05:21:49,009
How could you?

2888
05:21:49,009 --> 05:21:51,209
One battery, it destroys everything

2889
05:21:51,209 --> 05:21:53,860
it takes a picture of now, which.

2890
05:21:55,560 --> 05:21:58,529
When was the last time I heard somebody do that?

2891
05:21:58,529 --> 05:21:59,369
These.

2892
05:21:59,369 --> 05:22:01,209
So what if the weather disruptor didn't work?

2893
05:22:01,209 --> 05:22:03,009
This can't be the end of everything.

2894
05:22:03,970 --> 05:22:09,279
Search all the memories.

2895
05:22:09,279 --> 05:22:10,119
I gave up.

2896
05:22:10,119 --> 05:22:12,360
Okay.

2897
05:22:12,360 --> 05:22:15,040
I refuse to leave this place until I know the answer.

2898
05:22:15,040 --> 05:22:17,159
Until I save everything.

2899
05:22:35,759 --> 05:22:51,330
I need like a, sort of a bridge or something.

2900
05:22:51,330 --> 05:23:14,040
Hmm.

2901
05:23:14,040 --> 05:23:46,069
Is that far enough?

2902
05:23:46,069 --> 05:23:46,909
Whoa.

2903
05:23:46,909 --> 05:24:03,180
I forgot everything.

2904
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:24,770
I got to take a picture in front and then behind.

2905
05:24:24,770 --> 05:24:40,400
There we go.

2906
05:24:40,400 --> 05:24:43,360
This is wild.

2907
05:24:43,360 --> 05:24:56,279
Wild.

2908
05:24:56,279 --> 05:24:59,659
I'll give you a baby scoop ice cream.

2909
05:24:59,659 --> 05:25:03,000
I just, it's a manageable scoop.

2910
05:25:03,000 --> 05:25:06,659
And sometimes I just want one, just a little bit.

2911
05:25:06,659 --> 05:25:08,659
Especially if it's something like, oh yeah, here.

2912
05:25:08,659 --> 05:25:10,819
Here's our, our special, you know,

2913
05:25:10,819 --> 05:25:12,619
blueberry cheesecake ice cream.

2914
05:25:12,619 --> 05:25:14,020
It's like, okay, I just, I don't want a whole,

2915
05:25:14,020 --> 05:25:14,860
I don't want a lot of that.

2916
05:25:14,860 --> 05:25:15,700
I just want enough.

2917
05:25:15,700 --> 05:25:29,139
But it sounds great.

2918
05:25:29,139 --> 05:25:32,029
It's pretty here.

2919
05:25:32,029 --> 05:25:34,430
And the sound of the wind is nice.

2920
05:25:34,430 --> 05:25:37,939
Is this what yours once was?

2921
05:25:37,939 --> 05:25:40,659
Is this what you're trying to get back to?

2922
05:25:43,389 --> 05:25:48,770
Maybe take a picture of the windmill?

2923
05:25:48,770 --> 05:25:53,400
Ow.

2924
05:25:53,439 --> 05:25:55,799
You're going to get a sample and get full from it.

2925
05:25:55,799 --> 05:26:02,040
Now I want one scoop of blueberry cheesecake ice cream

2926
05:26:02,040 --> 05:26:11,840
or strawberry cheesecake or fudge cheesecake.

2927
05:26:11,840 --> 05:26:18,450
Or, oh, it's nine o'clock.

2928
05:26:18,450 --> 05:26:20,319
It's over.

2929
05:26:20,319 --> 05:26:22,200
I'm about to say something that's going to really,

2930
05:26:22,200 --> 05:26:23,040
I, and you know what?

2931
05:26:23,040 --> 05:26:27,400
I might not even say it

2932
05:26:27,400 --> 05:26:29,000
because a lot of you are going to hear this

2933
05:26:29,000 --> 05:26:35,680
and it's going to be a sigh of God damn it.

2934
05:26:35,680 --> 05:26:37,400
Butter crunch ice cream.

2935
05:26:37,400 --> 05:26:38,810
I'm just going to wing it.

2936
05:26:38,810 --> 05:26:40,250
You're completely out of my range.

2937
05:26:40,250 --> 05:26:41,090
Yeah.

2938
05:26:41,090 --> 05:26:43,130
I can't find you.

2939
05:26:43,130 --> 05:26:44,450
Vitals are still fine.

2940
05:26:44,450 --> 05:26:47,560
Like you're in a deep sleep.

2941
05:26:47,560 --> 05:26:49,000
New game plan.

2942
05:26:49,000 --> 05:26:49,840
What is that?

2943
05:26:49,840 --> 05:26:52,250
You're going to need to break the system somehow.

2944
05:26:52,250 --> 05:26:54,840
It's butter pecan ice cream,

2945
05:26:54,840 --> 05:26:56,959
but there's no pecans in it.

2946
05:26:56,959 --> 05:26:59,080
There's just little crunchies in it.

2947
05:26:59,080 --> 05:27:06,619
It's that delicious, buttery, sweet flavor.

2948
05:27:06,619 --> 05:27:07,700
That's boomer ice cream?

2949
05:27:07,700 --> 05:27:14,130
It is not, please.

2950
05:27:14,130 --> 05:27:15,330
It is awesome.

2951
05:27:15,330 --> 05:27:16,169
It's really good.

2952
05:27:16,169 --> 05:27:17,889
Mirren is refusing to listen to reason.

2953
05:27:17,889 --> 05:27:19,209
You Americans disgust me.

2954
05:27:19,209 --> 05:27:22,520
I'm not the only one who put time to this project

2955
05:27:22,520 --> 05:27:24,439
and it's not wholly a failure.

2956
05:27:24,439 --> 05:27:26,400
That's a green eggs and ham moment.

2957
05:27:26,400 --> 05:27:28,599
I even built a simulation of the world outside

2958
05:27:28,599 --> 05:27:29,439
just to keep track of the climate.

2959
05:27:29,439 --> 05:27:30,279
Just wait till they take a bite.

2960
05:27:30,279 --> 05:27:32,659
But it's not enough.

2961
05:27:32,659 --> 05:27:33,979
It needs a solution.

2962
05:27:33,979 --> 05:27:35,139
Some things just aren't.

2963
05:27:35,139 --> 05:27:36,979
Oh, I think I was supposed to copy this.

2964
05:27:36,979 --> 05:27:51,720
Not like this.

2965
05:27:51,720 --> 05:28:05,250
The only thing I can copy.

2966
05:28:05,250 --> 05:28:08,130
Best Ben and Jerry's flavor that is half baked.

2967
05:28:15,750 --> 05:28:18,909
You have a, oh shit, I do have the camera.

2968
05:28:18,909 --> 05:28:21,139
Oops.

2969
05:28:21,139 --> 05:28:28,729
I don't need it.

2970
05:28:29,090 --> 05:28:31,340
Okay, I just beat it.

2971
05:28:31,340 --> 05:28:58,950
Watch this.

2972
05:28:58,950 --> 05:29:00,029
Half baked is my go-to.

2973
05:29:00,029 --> 05:29:05,549
Yeah, I think it's just the easiest one.

2974
05:29:05,549 --> 05:29:09,130
It's definitely the easiest one to get.

2975
05:29:09,130 --> 05:29:10,889
There's a lot of other good ones for Ben and Jerry's too,

2976
05:29:10,889 --> 05:29:16,830
but half baked is just the best one to get.

2977
05:29:16,830 --> 05:29:19,479
Fish food's pretty good.

2978
05:29:19,479 --> 05:29:26,770
I'm a sucker for marshmallow, so.

2979
05:29:26,770 --> 05:29:39,619
Okay, just one.

2980
05:29:39,619 --> 05:29:47,299
Good enough.

2981
05:29:47,299 --> 05:29:58,689
Hmm, interesting.

2982
05:29:58,689 --> 05:30:03,119
No more film on the camera.

2983
05:30:03,119 --> 05:30:09,400
Can I jump over there?

2984
05:30:09,400 --> 05:30:28,409
Hmm, did I do this wrong?

2985
05:30:28,409 --> 05:30:41,799
Not this way, right?

2986
05:30:41,799 --> 05:30:45,860
Oh, there it is.

2987
05:30:45,860 --> 05:31:00,430
Okay, it's right here.

2988
05:31:00,430 --> 05:31:09,459
Hmm, I think I just did it.

2989
05:31:09,459 --> 05:31:18,349
I did it.

2990
05:31:18,349 --> 05:31:19,560
There is one.

2991
05:31:19,560 --> 05:31:20,400
I feel secure.

2992
05:31:20,400 --> 05:31:21,240
This is the last one?

2993
05:31:21,240 --> 05:31:22,400
Just as your friend said.

2994
05:31:22,400 --> 05:31:23,240
What about up top?

2995
05:31:23,240 --> 05:31:25,540
I wanna see up top.

2996
05:31:25,540 --> 05:31:28,529
Last level, so let's take a look.

2997
05:31:28,529 --> 05:31:40,590
Ah, there's one more.

2998
05:31:40,590 --> 05:31:43,159
Selfie?

2999
05:31:43,159 --> 05:31:50,279
Selfie, but I have the camera.

3000
05:31:50,279 --> 05:32:02,919
Hmm, I'll take another one.

3001
05:32:02,919 --> 05:32:08,040
Yikes.

3002
05:32:08,040 --> 05:32:13,770
Battery, two batteries.

3003
05:32:13,770 --> 05:32:39,740
Ah, I, um, hold on.

3004
05:32:39,740 --> 05:33:06,080
Hmm, I need to get a picture of this.

3005
05:33:08,409 --> 05:33:10,169
What about that moldy ice cream?

3006
05:33:10,169 --> 05:33:13,689
Yeah, but that was my fault for having,

3007
05:33:13,689 --> 05:33:24,959
I didn't realize it was there for that long.

3008
05:33:24,959 --> 05:33:25,919
It wasn't even moldy.

3009
05:33:25,919 --> 05:33:55,720
It was freezer burn.

3010
05:33:55,720 --> 05:34:11,880
That was very funny though, I will admit.

3011
05:34:11,880 --> 05:34:20,830
Timer, that's just, that's the stacker sound.

3012
05:34:20,830 --> 05:34:30,419
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

3013
05:34:30,419 --> 05:34:39,759
And then it goes, oh.

3014
05:34:39,759 --> 05:34:53,729
Hmm, camera.

3015
05:34:53,729 --> 05:35:08,930
Very obviously, I need to, like this, this over here.

3016
05:35:08,970 --> 05:35:16,159
And then take a picture of me there

3017
05:35:16,159 --> 05:35:25,880
and then teleport across the game over there.

3018
05:35:25,880 --> 05:35:33,409
Yes, this is it.

3019
05:35:33,409 --> 05:35:42,939
We're at the end.

3020
05:35:42,939 --> 05:35:49,110
This is the final level.

3021
05:35:49,110 --> 05:35:50,389
I want ice cream so bad now.

3022
05:35:50,389 --> 05:35:53,599
I, I do apologize.

3023
05:35:53,599 --> 05:35:55,319
It's getting later here.

3024
05:35:55,319 --> 05:36:03,700
It is definitely very late where you are potentially.

3025
05:36:03,700 --> 05:36:09,560
Five minutes.

3026
05:36:09,560 --> 05:36:14,689
Choices made.

3027
05:36:14,689 --> 05:36:23,709
Go.

3028
05:36:23,709 --> 05:36:25,349
Oh, this is gonna be a huge fan of the S,

3029
05:36:25,349 --> 05:36:27,439
I can already tell.

3030
05:36:27,439 --> 05:36:28,279
It's still going.

3031
05:36:28,279 --> 05:36:29,720
Why, I'm rewinding time.

3032
05:36:29,720 --> 05:36:31,759
What's happening here?

3033
05:36:31,759 --> 05:36:34,000
What the hell?

3034
05:36:34,000 --> 05:36:35,790
Oh boy.

3035
05:36:36,110 --> 05:36:40,419
Hold on.

3036
05:36:40,419 --> 05:36:41,619
What do I, I don't know.

3037
05:36:43,889 --> 05:36:44,970
Where do I go?

3038
05:36:44,970 --> 05:37:07,409
I just, can I reach another level?

3039
05:37:07,409 --> 05:37:10,409
Where did it, where did it, where did it, where did it,

3040
05:37:10,409 --> 05:37:24,779
where is it?

3041
05:37:24,779 --> 05:37:45,720
There, why did it disappear before?

3042
05:37:45,720 --> 05:37:55,880
Come on, go.

3043
05:37:55,880 --> 05:38:04,959
Hesitation is the enemy of innovation.

3044
05:38:04,959 --> 05:38:08,119
Oh my God, dude, come on, this bullshit.

3045
05:38:27,659 --> 05:38:29,139
Oh my God, I'm not letting it go.

3046
05:38:29,139 --> 05:38:52,119
It's, what am I supposed to do with this?

3047
05:38:52,119 --> 05:39:05,529
Huh, where is it?

3048
05:39:05,529 --> 05:40:07,720
Dude, what am I, what?

3049
05:40:07,720 --> 05:40:10,799
What was the, why is the radio there?

3050
05:40:10,799 --> 05:40:13,869
What was the point of the radio?

3051
05:40:13,869 --> 05:40:23,529
I don't get it.

3052
05:40:23,529 --> 05:40:24,650
It's just a distraction?

3053
05:40:24,650 --> 05:40:25,490
Was it really?

3054
05:40:25,490 --> 05:40:35,400
That's annoying.

3055
05:40:35,400 --> 05:40:37,880
Oh, what about, what's his name?

3056
05:40:37,880 --> 05:40:38,759
I don't know, whatever.

3057
05:40:38,759 --> 05:40:50,159
It's a distraction, just go.

3058
05:40:50,159 --> 05:41:46,099
It's time for distraction news.

3059
05:41:46,099 --> 05:41:52,090
Oh my goodness gracious.

3060
05:41:52,090 --> 05:42:00,180
This fucking level.

3061
05:42:00,180 --> 05:42:05,479
Get up there, you stupid fucking thing.

3062
05:42:05,479 --> 05:42:35,610
Oops, I fell off.

3063
05:42:35,610 --> 05:42:37,330
What's this?

3064
05:42:37,330 --> 05:42:38,930
I'll take it, I'll take it.

3065
05:42:38,930 --> 05:43:02,159
Teapot?

3066
05:43:24,909 --> 05:43:25,750
Where are we going?

3067
05:43:25,750 --> 05:43:29,000
Where are we going?

3068
05:43:29,000 --> 05:43:29,840
This way?

3069
05:43:29,840 --> 05:43:31,880
I need two batteries.

3070
05:43:31,880 --> 05:43:33,220
Two, oh my goodness.

3071
05:43:35,080 --> 05:43:45,349
Oh shit.

3072
05:43:45,349 --> 05:43:47,630
Why did, where are the batteries?

3073
05:43:47,630 --> 05:43:52,599
Oh, oh boy.

3074
05:43:56,610 --> 05:44:30,000
Okay, wait, don't do that yet.

3075
05:44:30,000 --> 05:44:30,880
Hurry up, come on.

3076
05:44:43,400 --> 05:44:44,919
What the fuck did I just do?

3077
05:44:52,049 --> 05:44:57,529
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, come on.

3078
05:44:57,529 --> 05:45:00,490
Wait, where, wait, hold on.

3079
05:45:01,169 --> 05:45:04,130
What the heck just happened?

3080
05:45:04,130 --> 05:45:06,049
Oh shit, this is not real.

3081
05:45:06,049 --> 05:45:11,259
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

3082
05:45:11,259 --> 05:45:19,729
Ah, um, ah, ooh, ah.

3083
05:45:51,389 --> 05:45:52,229
All right, what do I need?

3084
05:45:52,229 --> 05:45:55,700
Do I need batteries?

3085
05:45:55,700 --> 05:45:56,540
What are you trying?

3086
05:45:56,540 --> 05:45:58,459
Okay, go around the pillar in a circle,

3087
05:45:58,459 --> 05:45:59,299
but what's the pillar?

3088
05:45:59,299 --> 05:46:02,619
Where is it?

3089
05:46:02,619 --> 05:46:03,740
Where is it?

3090
05:46:03,740 --> 05:46:04,580
Where is it?

3091
05:46:04,580 --> 05:46:05,419
Where is it?

3092
05:46:05,419 --> 05:46:17,119
Where is it?

3093
05:46:17,119 --> 05:46:35,479
Should I take another one?

3094
05:46:35,479 --> 05:46:41,299
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3095
05:46:42,750 --> 05:46:45,099
Come on, dude, do it.

3096
05:46:45,860 --> 05:46:47,380
You're killing me with this bullshit.

3097
05:46:47,380 --> 05:46:53,080
You are killing me.

3098
05:46:53,080 --> 05:46:53,919
You're killing me with this.

3099
05:46:53,919 --> 05:46:54,959
You're killing me, you're killing me,

3100
05:46:54,959 --> 05:46:57,770
you're killing me, you're killing me.

3101
05:46:57,770 --> 05:46:59,970
You are killing me with this.

3102
05:46:59,970 --> 05:47:03,400
Um, you're killing me.

3103
05:47:03,400 --> 05:47:08,770
No, no, no, it's over, I lose.

3104
05:47:14,310 --> 05:47:44,610
I just got three Luigi notifications in a row.

3105
05:47:44,610 --> 05:48:23,290
Luigi is spam texting me right now.

3106
05:48:23,290 --> 05:48:33,619
Grr, I'm flexing that one.

3107
05:48:33,619 --> 05:48:45,639
Okay, now the battery is down here.

3108
05:48:45,639 --> 05:48:48,200
Fuck, I forget, I forget, I forget.

3109
05:48:48,200 --> 05:48:49,240
Hold on, go back, back, back, back, back.

3110
05:48:49,240 --> 05:48:53,880
What, um, um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep.

3111
05:48:53,880 --> 05:48:58,840
I take, um, I, why did I fucking forget this?

3112
05:48:58,840 --> 05:49:00,279
The photocopier, I forgot I had

3113
05:49:00,279 --> 05:49:12,060
this stupid fucking photocopier.

3114
05:49:12,060 --> 05:49:13,700
I don't even need to take two copies of this.

3115
05:49:13,700 --> 05:49:37,720
I have two, I already have two copies.

3116
05:49:37,720 --> 05:50:08,310
I forget.

3117
05:50:08,310 --> 05:50:10,430
Pace is fine, I got three minutes,

3118
05:50:10,430 --> 05:50:34,110
so it was two and a half minutes.

3119
05:50:34,470 --> 05:50:38,970
Okay, all right, I need two batteries there.

3120
05:50:41,680 --> 05:50:45,150
Okay, we're gonna teleport over there.

3121
05:50:45,150 --> 05:50:53,360
Am I, no, I'm not.

3122
05:50:53,360 --> 05:51:02,770
Okay, all right, all right, now I need to get batteries in.

3123
05:51:02,770 --> 05:51:07,180
I need the radio.

3124
05:51:07,180 --> 05:51:10,799
Do I actually need the radio?

3125
05:51:10,799 --> 05:51:14,919
Where's the radio?

3126
05:51:14,919 --> 05:51:19,529
Where's the radio?

3127
05:51:19,529 --> 05:51:25,659
Can't I power this some other way?

3128
05:51:25,659 --> 05:51:41,500
Take a picture of, um, oh my God.

3129
05:51:41,500 --> 05:51:42,340
Bleh!

3130
05:51:47,450 --> 05:51:49,360
Okay.

3131
05:51:51,599 --> 05:51:54,799
All right, now, where's the, wait, wait.

3132
05:52:00,560 --> 05:52:02,720
Oh no, oh no.

3133
05:52:02,720 --> 05:52:06,560
I need to take a picture of this whole thing.

3134
05:52:06,560 --> 05:52:10,880
Oh, it's over, I think it's, I think it's over.

3135
05:52:10,880 --> 05:52:18,509
Boys and girls, it might be over right now.

3136
05:52:18,509 --> 05:52:24,450
Oh, fuck off with this stupid horse shit.

3137
05:52:24,450 --> 05:52:42,750
Oh, God damn it, this is really hard.

3138
05:52:42,750 --> 05:53:01,709
Get these bushes out of my face.

3139
05:53:01,709 --> 05:53:07,919
Okay, I'm gonna take a picture of the radio.

3140
05:53:15,959 --> 05:53:16,799
We're good.

3141
05:53:16,799 --> 05:53:19,040
All right, I gotta stop fucking laughing,

3142
05:53:19,040 --> 05:53:24,189
like stop laughing.

3143
05:53:24,189 --> 05:53:35,689
I, get this shit away from me.

3144
05:53:35,689 --> 05:53:55,439
I'm good, okay, everything's better.

3145
05:53:55,439 --> 05:54:08,349
I just need two of these, that's it.

3146
05:54:08,349 --> 05:54:29,979
Oh, oh, I forgot, I forget.

3147
05:54:29,979 --> 05:54:32,880
It's gone already, why is it gone?

3148
05:54:32,880 --> 05:54:58,400
I remember, I don't even need two of these,

3149
05:54:58,400 --> 05:54:59,319
but I'm gonna take two

3150
05:54:59,319 --> 05:55:10,090
because maybe the last level needs it.

3151
05:55:10,090 --> 05:55:13,290
All right, let's go, plenty of time.

3152
05:55:13,290 --> 05:55:19,639
Just use the radio, boom.

3153
05:55:19,639 --> 05:55:23,709
That shit is so far away.

3154
05:55:24,349 --> 05:55:26,310
Oh, you're driving me fucking crazy with this.

3155
05:55:26,310 --> 05:55:36,069
What, just drop it.

3156
05:55:36,069 --> 05:55:42,139
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3157
05:55:42,139 --> 05:55:43,299
What was the point of that?

3158
05:55:43,299 --> 05:55:44,740
Why did I just even do that?

3159
05:55:44,740 --> 05:55:55,790
What?

3160
05:55:55,790 --> 05:55:56,630
I did it.

3161
05:55:56,630 --> 05:55:57,470
You did well.

3162
05:55:57,470 --> 05:55:58,310
Thank God.

3163
05:55:58,310 --> 05:56:00,680
It's thanks to you.

3164
05:56:00,680 --> 05:56:02,720
I got, I got it, I got it, everything's fine.

3165
05:56:02,720 --> 05:56:08,680
She was desperate, but I see now,

3166
05:56:08,680 --> 05:56:10,119
there is no singular truth.

3167
05:56:10,119 --> 05:56:13,470
That was tough, that's not a perfect answer.

3168
05:56:13,470 --> 05:56:16,680
Anything meeting you in this place

3169
05:56:16,680 --> 05:56:22,810
was the closest I would ever get to knowing.

3170
05:56:22,849 --> 05:56:26,119
The red world that awaits you.

3171
05:56:26,119 --> 05:56:28,110
Is it loving?

3172
05:56:28,110 --> 05:56:40,279
Is it healing?

3173
05:56:40,279 --> 05:56:41,959
Ow, what?

3174
05:56:41,959 --> 05:56:46,560
You didn't tell me there's physical force in these, man.

3175
05:56:46,560 --> 05:56:48,919
I see.

3176
05:56:48,919 --> 05:56:51,360
Suppose our time has come to an end.

3177
05:56:52,279 --> 05:56:57,040
Thank you for stopping by.

3178
05:56:57,040 --> 05:57:02,639
I wish you well.

3179
05:57:02,639 --> 05:57:06,159
This is the real final level then.

3180
05:57:06,159 --> 05:57:08,959
I beat the level already.

3181
05:57:08,959 --> 05:57:11,799
You really get, I'm gonna get a Luigi text

3182
05:57:11,799 --> 05:57:14,290
before I even get to try it.

3183
05:57:14,290 --> 05:57:15,130
That's kind of,

3184
05:57:15,130 --> 05:58:04,479
that's like the last plant on earth or something.

3185
05:58:04,479 --> 05:58:23,639
Don't drop it.

3186
05:58:23,639 --> 05:58:27,680
You probably need some rest.

3187
05:58:27,680 --> 05:58:28,720
Too good to be true.

3188
05:58:30,520 --> 05:58:34,080
So awful.

3189
05:58:34,080 --> 05:58:35,159
Not yet.

3190
05:58:35,159 --> 05:58:38,099
We can keep brainstorming on that.

3191
05:58:38,099 --> 05:58:39,180
Hmm?

3192
05:58:39,180 --> 05:58:41,279
Wait, what's that?

3193
05:58:41,279 --> 05:58:42,119
I got the plant.

3194
05:58:42,119 --> 05:58:55,229
What kind of plant was that?

3195
05:58:55,229 --> 05:58:59,569
I did it.

3196
05:58:59,569 --> 05:59:08,909
I got the good ending.

3197
05:59:08,909 --> 05:59:10,689
Well, that was great.

3198
05:59:10,689 --> 05:59:14,080
That was a really fun game.

3199
05:59:14,080 --> 05:59:16,040
I enjoyed that the whole way through.

3200
05:59:39,080 --> 05:59:42,520
Should have taken, should have taken the kitty.

3201
05:59:42,520 --> 05:59:51,119
But you, what's wrong with you?

3202
05:59:51,119 --> 05:59:54,209
Most streamers beat this in 20 minutes.

3203
05:59:54,209 --> 05:59:57,900
The opening cut scene and tutorial is 20 minutes.

3204
05:59:57,900 --> 06:00:09,700
Nice try though.

3205
06:00:09,700 --> 06:00:12,310
Speedruns will be fun with this though.

3206
06:00:12,310 --> 06:00:13,849
People will break this.

3207
06:00:13,849 --> 06:00:15,369
They'll take a picture of something like three times

3208
06:00:15,369 --> 06:00:32,380
and crash it or something.

3209
06:00:32,380 --> 06:00:35,720
There's a lot of levels.

3210
06:00:35,720 --> 06:00:38,360
That third chapter had like 20 something levels.

3211
06:00:38,360 --> 06:00:45,770
22, 23.

3212
06:00:45,770 --> 06:00:49,299
The any% right now is 24 minutes.

3213
06:00:49,299 --> 06:01:05,020
Jeez, that seems hard.

3214
06:01:05,020 --> 06:01:07,220
You're gonna do bouncing duck sim?

3215
06:01:07,220 --> 06:01:08,060
Yeah, not tonight though.

3216
06:01:08,060 --> 06:01:22,860
I think we've been live for a decent amount of time.

3217
06:01:22,860 --> 06:01:27,520
I'll be live again on Monday

3218
06:01:28,279 --> 06:01:29,639
and Monday is an interesting day

3219
06:01:29,639 --> 06:01:37,180
because armored core is an option,

3220
06:01:37,180 --> 06:01:48,880
but so is bouncing duck simulator.

3221
06:01:48,880 --> 06:01:50,599
The U2's also launches on Monday.

3222
06:01:50,599 --> 06:01:54,220
Well, it's for sale on Monday.

3223
06:01:54,220 --> 06:01:59,139
I don't think it delivers for a month or two after that.

3224
06:01:59,139 --> 06:02:03,080
But bouncing duck looks, that was a poke recommendation.

3225
06:02:03,080 --> 06:02:05,279
I looked it up.

3226
06:02:05,279 --> 06:02:08,799
It looks pretty great.

3227
06:02:08,799 --> 06:02:17,959
So we'll figure it out tomorrow for a Monday.

3228
06:02:17,959 --> 06:02:21,250
And then later in the week after Monday,

3229
06:02:21,250 --> 06:02:28,200
probably on maybe Sunday, Friday, Sunday, I'll pick a day.

3230
06:02:28,200 --> 06:02:33,290
We'll get back into Sorcery part four.

3231
06:02:33,330 --> 06:02:35,540
Oh no, you guys are right.

3232
06:02:35,540 --> 06:02:39,900
I didn't, I didn't save Kate.

3233
06:02:39,900 --> 06:02:40,740
That's on me.

3234
06:02:40,740 --> 06:02:47,229
That's my bad.

3235
06:02:47,229 --> 06:02:49,369
Very cool.

3236
06:02:49,369 --> 06:02:53,200
I give it a very, very, very fun out of 10.

3237
06:02:53,200 --> 06:02:54,709
That was very good.

3238
06:02:54,709 --> 06:02:58,680
Very enjoyable.

3239
06:02:58,680 --> 06:03:10,759
Just the core gameplay mechanic alone is worth playing it.

3240
06:03:10,759 --> 06:03:13,869
That's, that's it.

3241
06:03:13,869 --> 06:03:23,369
Perfect timing, I guess.

3242
06:03:23,369 --> 06:03:24,689
People said this was a three hour game

3243
06:03:24,689 --> 06:03:29,240
and it was gonna take you six hours.

3244
06:03:29,240 --> 06:03:33,740
Yeah, but I feel like it,

3245
06:03:33,740 --> 06:03:37,060
even if I, even if you blow through every level,

3246
06:03:37,060 --> 06:03:44,680
I feel like it would take you more than three hours.

3247
06:03:44,680 --> 06:03:46,200
I did do the optional levels too.

3248
06:03:46,200 --> 06:03:48,560
Almost all of them,

3249
06:03:48,560 --> 06:03:58,200
which I'm sure that added at least 45 minutes to an hour.

3250
06:03:58,200 --> 06:04:01,240
Pretty average play time.

3251
06:04:01,240 --> 06:04:03,319
Yeah, and we also talk about ice cream

3252
06:04:03,319 --> 06:04:06,790
and ketchup and mustard combinations.

3253
06:04:06,790 --> 06:04:10,430
You always have to add the streamer one to two hour

3254
06:04:10,430 --> 06:04:21,840
of I'm walking in a circle and talking.

3255
06:04:21,840 --> 06:04:27,130
But yeah, I'll see you guys on Monday.

3256
06:04:27,130 --> 06:04:32,790
Gonna start with Bouncing Duck Simulator.

3257
06:04:32,790 --> 06:04:38,240
And after, I might just play that the whole day.

3258
06:04:38,240 --> 06:04:41,080
If I get over that or get bored of that,

3259
06:04:41,080 --> 06:04:47,439
it might be an attempt of Armored Core 6.

3260
06:04:47,439 --> 06:04:49,080
Either one of those two will be on Monday.

3261
06:04:49,080 --> 06:04:57,430
And then later in the weekend, we'll do Sorcery.

3262
06:04:57,430 --> 06:04:58,700
Thanks again.

3263
06:04:58,700 --> 06:04:59,540
See you soon.

3264
06:04:59,540 --> 06:05:00,360
Take care of yourselves.

3265
06:05:00,360 --> 06:05:06,619
Get some sleep.

3266
06:05:06,619 --> 06:05:17,860
Have a wonderful rest of your night.

3267
06:05:17,860 --> 06:05:20,119
Bye, even though mustard is dog shit.

3268
06:05:20,119 --> 06:05:23,779
Hey, we can have different opinions.

3269
06:05:23,779 --> 06:05:27,009
Yours is just wrong.

3270
06:05:27,009 --> 06:05:34,619
Thanks for coming though.

3271
06:05:34,619 --> 06:05:45,270
I'm a mustard Andy, okay?

3272
06:05:45,270 --> 06:05:47,880
That emote, how many emotes?

3273
06:05:47,880 --> 06:05:53,520
I just, why are these emotes even here?

3274
06:05:53,520 --> 06:05:57,560
Does anybody think German mustard is still funny

3275
06:05:57,560 --> 06:06:10,720
from like 2016?

3276
06:06:10,720 --> 06:06:14,979
That was, I don't know what to put for an emote slot.

3277
06:06:14,979 --> 06:06:17,299
And there are subscriptions on the channel.

3278
06:06:18,060 --> 06:06:20,159
I have to come up with something.

3279
06:06:20,159 --> 06:06:22,700
Guess this is what it is.

3280
06:06:22,700 --> 06:06:25,099
And then eight years went by

3281
06:06:25,099 --> 06:06:39,849
and I added one or two more emotes.

3282
06:06:39,849 --> 06:06:47,450
Honestly, I think the BTTV emotes just sort of took over.

3283
06:06:47,450 --> 06:06:49,110
It was just, if something was,

3284
06:06:49,110 --> 06:06:56,540
the mods was just added.

3285
06:06:56,540 --> 06:06:58,740
That way everybody can just use them.

3286
06:06:58,740 --> 06:07:02,020
Some of them I think deserve to be sub emotes,

3287
06:07:02,020 --> 06:07:14,740
but a lot of them just should be BTTV.

3288
06:07:14,740 --> 06:07:16,400
All right, see you Monday.

3289
06:07:16,400 --> 06:07:17,240
Take care.

3290
06:07:17,240 --> 06:07:18,700
Call your mother.

3291
06:07:18,700 --> 06:07:32,450
Drink some water.

3292
06:07:32,450 --> 06:07:37,819
Take care of yourself.

3293
06:07:37,819 --> 06:07:39,560
In what order?

3294
06:07:39,560 --> 06:07:46,389
Whatever order you are comfortable.

3295
06:07:48,229 --> 06:07:49,369
See you Monday.

3296
06:07:49,369 --> 06:08:41,650
Take care.
