1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,900
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second ever Jerma Rumble.

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,399
I hope you're ready for some newcomers as well as some old favorites.

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:25,859
So sit back and relax, and here we go with the Jerma Rumble.

4
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,859
Alright, and with that introduction, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we're going to get started here.

5
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,359
Welcome to the second Jerma Rumble. I'm glad to be your presenter.

6
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,859
And the first one to come down the ring is going to be Astronaut Spaceman Star,

7
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,859
who just got back from his 72nd expedition.

8
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:43,859
So if we could give him a round of applause to Star for that, that's a very good accomplishment.

9
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,159
And he'll be number one, and that's not an easy position to have.

10
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,159
Number two is going to be Pac-Man. Pac-Man is a newcomer to the Jerma Rumble.

11
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,159
He is brand new here. He said he wanted to come in, wanted to take over, wanted to use his big, orange, disgusting, ugly bits.

12
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,159
And he's getting kind of startled by something there on the...

13
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,159
I'm not sure if there was a mouse or what was there, but Pac-Man's ready to go.

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,159
And he's number two. Both of these guys are going to have quite a difficult time.

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,159
You saw what happened last time.

16
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,159
The first five are so, so much at a disadvantage than the last five.

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,159
But the bell has been rung. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get started here.

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,159
Welcome to the second ever Jerma Rumble. No more time wasted.

19
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,159
Here we go. Star and Pac-Man fighting in the ring, and immediately Star going for the Pac-Man chest push.

20
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,159
He's going to try to get him over that top rope. Remember, you have to go over the top rope.

21
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,159
Pac-Man not going to have any of that as of right now.

22
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,159
Spins around Star, throws him into the rope.

23
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,159
Star does a little jump over that side there, which is a pretty nifty move.

24
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,159
And initially, it always starts like this.

25
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,159
Somebody always goes for a push, somebody reverses it, somebody throws it.

26
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,159
You know, the AI is fucking stupid, alright?

27
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,159
So let's just put it that way. What a move by Pac-Man throwing him in the air and dropping him on his belly.

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,159
And just like that, we have our first new entrance.

29
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,159
It could be anybody. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Grandpa.

30
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,530
Coming down to the Jerma Arena with what seems like a couple of foreign objects there.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,530
I think somebody needs to tell him he cannot bring that Kendo stick down to the ring.

32
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,830
And he's got a Soda in the other hand. Now that's definitely not Soda.

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,330
I can guarantee that's not Soda.

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,330
So if somebody gets that stick away from him, do not let him in the ring with that stick.

35
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,330
He could hurt somebody.

36
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,500
Anyways, coming back to the action here, we've got a block.

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
What a punch by Pac-Man, and down goes Star.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
What a beautiful right hand to his head.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
And he's wearing a helmet too.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
You've got to figure some of that damage would be blocked.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
And immediate reaction to Grandpa coming to the ring with a belly-to-back slam on the back.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
And Pac-Man is taunting. Pac-Man is here.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
What a fantastic display so far.

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
He is doing work on both of these two competitors.

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
And now he's going to take a little bit of a breather.

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Maybe they'll try to both eliminate Grandpa. That's a good idea.

47
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
He's trying to.

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,870
Seems like he may have injured his left shoulder there.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,870
If you saw that, he was favoring that left shoulder.

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,870
Maybe when he picked up Grandpa and did the slam, he might have hurt himself.

51
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,870
Now that's a very bad thing. It's very early here.

52
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,870
And you do not...

53
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,870
What a beautiful double-teaming front neck breaker by the two, Grandpa and Pac-Man.

54
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,870
But what I was saying is, you've got to be careful here.

55
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,870
If he is injured, if Pac-Man is hurt, he could be eliminated very, very shortly.

56
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,180
But there is the buzzer time to go check out who is the next person to come in the ring.

57
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,180
It could be anybody. It could be your brother. It could be your sister.

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,479
It could even be the Spy Party Monopoly Guy.

59
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,479
That's who it is, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome the Monopoly Guy to the German Arena.

60
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,479
And the funny thing about the Monopoly Guy is he is not the Monopoly Guy.

61
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,479
He just was an...Germa is an idiot.

62
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,479
Instead, he was the Monopoly Guy when he actually is more like Sir Topham Hatt.

63
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,479
But whatever, Monopoly Guy showing himself for the first time.

64
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,479
And what a lunging elbow to Starr.

65
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,479
Starr has been receiving a lot of pain in this initial period.

66
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,479
Grandpa almost goes over the top. Pac-Man almost eliminates Grandpa.

67
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,659
And Pac-Man just kind of lets him get up.

68
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,960
Something that's very, very interesting here, guys.

69
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,960
No eliminations.

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
There has not been any eliminations yet.

71
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Everybody is still in this ring.

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
And we're going to have another person coming down here.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Another competitor. Very, very shortly.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Great reversal by Grandpa, as I say that.

75
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Into another reversal by Pac-Man.

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,960
But take a look at this. We're going to have five people here without a single elimination.

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
It's going to start to get crowded. It's going to start to get crazy.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
And what better time to introduce another person to have five in the ring.

79
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,959
Who's it going to be, ladies and gentlemen?

80
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,649
It's Gabe Newell. And listen to that crowd roar.

81
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,649
He's sprinting down to the arena.

82
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,649
He's not going to mess around like last time.

83
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,649
He's spent a lot of time in that arena.

84
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,649
A lot of time training since that event.

85
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:30,649
And my goodness gracious, everyone is so excited to see him.

86
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,649
Gabe, welcome back to the Jerma Arena.

87
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,649
So we got a little crowded here.

88
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,649
Five in here, like I said previously.

89
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,649
Gabe Newell is holding the Monopoly guy back by his arms.

90
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,649
And letting Star punch him in the stomach.

91
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:45,819
That was a little bit odd.

92
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,819
And now Star kind of changing his heart a little bit.

93
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,819
Going with a headbutt to Gabe Newell with that helmet on.

94
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,819
That should be illegal.

95
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:54,819
He should be thrown out for that disgraceful thing there.

96
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,819
But Star kind of...

97
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,819
But no one's getting eliminated. This is ridiculous.

98
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,000
We're going to have six people in this ring.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That could be a first for the Jerma Rumble.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Six or seven I think is the maximum amount of people that were in the last one.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,180
And here comes somebody else.

102
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,180
Rounding up the number six spot is going to be an infamous gaming character.

103
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
Throwing up the three sign.

104
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Trying to give us a hint maybe on one of his future games.

105
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,170
The iconic, the wonderful, the scientific Gordon Freeman.

106
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,170
Gordon Freeman making his debut here.

107
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,170
Gabe Newell's in the ring.

108
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,170
Gabe Newell cannot be happy about that announcement for Half-Life 3.

109
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,980
I would not be if I was in Gabe's shoes.

110
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,980
And speaking of Gabe, gets grabbed by the Monopoly guy behind him.

111
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Kicks him right in his Achilles heel and punches him in the head.

112
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
No, he misses.

113
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
But he ends up picking up Gordon Freeman and throwing him around.

114
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
And a slam.

115
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
And Star has been eliminated.

116
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,980
Star is the first person in the Jerma Rumble to be eliminated.

117
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Too bad, Star.

118
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
We had high hopes for you.

119
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,980
With that sweeping slam by Gordon Freeman on Gabe Newell.

120
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,980
Something tells me there's going to be a rivalry there.

121
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
They are probably going to be very annoyed with each other.

122
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Especially because of that announcement.

123
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
They're both in trouble.

124
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Gordon Freeman now.

125
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Looks like he's getting double teamed by Pac-Man and the Monopoly guy.

126
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Is he going to come out?

127
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Could Gordon Freeman be that quickly eliminated?

128
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,980
It would be such a shame if he was.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,980
No, he's holding on for dear life.

130
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
And he stays in.

131
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
And we've got Gabe Newell with a crushing lariat to Grandpa.

132
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
And he goes over the top turnbuckle.

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Which means you are eliminated, Grandpa.

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
You didn't make it this time.

135
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
You didn't make it last time.

136
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
You keep coming up short.

137
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
You need to go back and train.

138
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,980
You don't drink beer out of a soda can to train.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Maybe you'll learn that next time.

140
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Anyways, guys, we've got four people in the ring.

141
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
It's kind of lightened up a little bit.

142
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
There is not six people.

143
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,980
There are not six huge men poking in this ring.

144
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
There's only four now.

145
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Very interesting dynamic, though.

146
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,160
But we've got somebody coming out here in about 10 seconds.

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
I wonder who it's going to be.

148
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Not sure.

149
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
Gabe Newell accepting a bunch of punches by Pac-Man.

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
But he ends up dodging the last one.

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
But it's OK.

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,399
Because we have another competitor coming down right now.

153
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,399
And if you don't recognize this guy,

154
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,399
then I will be glad to help you with that.

155
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,399
He's one of the top Team Fortress 2 competitive players in the world.

156
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,829
It's Mela.

157
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,069
Mela, ladies and gentlemen, making his debut to the Jerma Arena.

158
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,069
Just casually walking down to the ring.

159
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,069
But you've got to give him a little bit of credit for that.

160
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:14,069
He's conserving his energy.

161
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,069
Sliding into the ring.

162
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,069
There he is.

163
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,629
Being a cocky asshole, it seems.

164
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,629
He just gets in the ring and starts taunting.

165
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:22,629
Nobody really seems to mind.

166
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:25,629
And he does a nice little elbow drop there on the Monopoly guy.

167
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,629
Got five people here.

168
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,629
Gabe Newell going for some punches on Mela.

169
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:29,629
Gets blocked by one of them.

170
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:31,629
Pac-Man is just missing people.

171
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,629
He's trying to grab people.

172
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,629
But he's just missing over and over again.

173
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,629
And that's what happens when your brain is the size of a dog brain.

174
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,629
If you don't know how big a dog brain is, they're pretty small.

175
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,629
And Gabe Newell now could be throwing Mela out immediately.

176
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,629
He's got him almost over the whole turnbuckle.

177
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,629
I thought he was going over.

178
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,629
That was some sheer strength by Mela.

179
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,629
And Pac-Man has been punched in the face over the top.

180
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:54,629
He's out.

181
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:57,629
The first person to be introduced is now eliminated.

182
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:00,060
And we've got somebody else coming down.

183
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,060
Hailing from your local neighborhood daring.

184
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,370
He's primed.

185
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,370
He's ready.

186
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,370
He's a 30s milkman.

187
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,930
Yeah, I know.

188
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,930
I know.

189
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,930
This guy sucks.

190
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,930
Yeah, this guy is probably worse than Batboy.

191
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,930
But sometimes you just have to have a 30s milkman be part of a Royal Rumble.

192
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,230
But whatever.

193
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,230
He's here.

194
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,230
Milkman is in German Rumble too.

195
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,230
And it's something we're all going to have to come to terms with.

196
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
But let's start talking about the action again.

197
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,230
We've got Gabe Newell kind of walking around aimlessly in the top right.

198
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,230
Not really sure where he wants to go.

199
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,230
Beautiful leg sweep there by Gordon Freeman.

200
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,230
And bang!

201
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,230
What a kick to the face.

202
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,230
And there goes the Monopoly guy.

203
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,230
See you next time.

204
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,230
Maybe you won't get shot in the face immediately in Spy Party.

205
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,230
Even though you will because that's how the game is played.

206
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,230
And a scoop slam by the milkman.

207
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,230
And now we've got something interesting, ladies and gents.

208
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,230
We've got Gordon Freeman and Gabe Newell fighting in the top right here.

209
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,230
This is a score that needs to be settled.

210
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,230
And it looks like Gordon Freeman has the upper hand destroying Gabe Newell in this last couple exchanges.

211
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,230
A third exchange.

212
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,230
Gabe Newell is getting destroyed, getting crushed, getting humiliated.

213
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,230
Just trying to stay alive.

214
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,230
He keeps getting blocked and countered and reversed.

215
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,230
It's horrible.

216
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,230
It's horrible.

217
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,230
Gabe Newell cannot do anything right now to Gordon Freeman.

218
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,230
And Gordon Freeman jumping on his leg.

219
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,230
This could be bad.

220
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,230
Gabe Newell has been eliminated.

221
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,230
Gabe Newell has been.

222
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,230
He tried to set up a powerbomb over the tough turnbuckle.

223
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,230
That could have gone either way.

224
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,230
But Gabe Newell is out.

225
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,230
And here comes Earthworm Jim.

226
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,470
Feeling that crowd.

227
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
Getting so pumped up.

228
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,470
It's so bad to see something so sad and then something so happy like Earthworm Jim's debut.

229
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,470
Gabe Newell is still standing at ringside.

230
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,470
He is shocked as are we all.

231
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,470
We can't believe he was eliminated.

232
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,470
Gordon Freeman with that incredible hurricanrana over the top rope.

233
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,470
I really thought we were going to see a repeat from last time when Gabe Newell powerbombed Sonic over the top.

234
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,470
But that is just not what happened.

235
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,470
And there's got to be a metaphor there.

236
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,649
There's a metaphor buried in there somewhere.

237
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:55,649
I just can't seem to find it at the moment.

238
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,649
But Earthworm Jim now has Gordon Freeman over the top rope.

239
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,649
Maybe some revenge enacted.

240
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:01,649
And there's the revenge right there.

241
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,649
Earthworm Jim comes in, gives him the finger, tells him to go screw himself.

242
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,649
And there it is right there.

243
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,649
Gordon Freeman is livid right now.

244
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,649
And there is another elimination.

245
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:12,649
We've got three people left in the ring.

246
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,649
Earthworm Jim, Mela, and the 30s milkman with somebody else on the way.

247
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,210
This is going to put us at the halfway point.

248
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:26,210
And who else to put us at the halfway point than the most iconic gaming character to ever live?

249
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,210
That's right.

250
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,210
It's Super Mario.

251
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,639
Showing off his patented long jump, super jump, whatever you want to call it.

252
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:40,639
It's such an honor to have the real, absolute not fake Super Mario from Nintendo

253
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,639
and not a drunk beer in a Mario costume.

254
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,940
It is just such an honor.

255
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,940
What a side super kick there by the beer, by Mario.

256
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
That was just so unbelievable.

257
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Took us head off almost.

258
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
I wonder if Mela still has teeth.

259
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,309
You know, I want to talk about Earthworm Jim.

260
00:10:56,309 --> 00:10:58,309
I want to talk about Jim for just a second here.

261
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,309
He's an underdog.

262
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,309
I'm rooting for Earthworm Jim because he hasn't had a game in a long time.

263
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,309
He's been kind of under the radar.

264
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,309
He hasn't been at the gaming scene, really.

265
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,309
There's been talks over the years that he was going to come back and do some more games,

266
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,309
but it hasn't really surfaced yet.

267
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:14,309
And I really hope to see him flourish during this Rumble.

268
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,309
I don't know if you probably agree with me.

269
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:19,309
And we've got another competitor coming down here after the talk about Jim.

270
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,309
We're going to talk about other weird characters.

271
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,129
And who the hell is this?

272
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,129
Well, that makes sense.

273
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,129
It is right around the corner.

274
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:27,129
It's the Easter Bunny.

275
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:32,129
The Easter Bunny showing up, one of our first holiday-themed characters to be graced at the arena.

276
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,129
He's frolicking down.

277
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:35,129
No basket.

278
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,129
No goodies for the children today.

279
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,129
But, you know, who cares?

280
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,129
He's here to kick some ass.

281
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,129
He's here to fight, not to really make any children happy.

282
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:45,129
And he kind of has a weird hairy back.

283
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:46,129
That's a little strange.

284
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:47,129
He's supposed to have feathers.

285
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,129
And there goes the...

286
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:50,129
No, the Mario stays in.

287
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,129
Mario stays in to see another day.

288
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:55,299
And curiosity is now starting to peak in my brain.

289
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,299
Because, number one, you know that Jerma's going to show up at some point.

290
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,299
You know that Burger Boy's probably here at some fashion.

291
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,299
You know that people are here.

292
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,299
You just don't know in what order they're going to come out in.

293
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:07,299
And that's the beauty of the Rumble.

294
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,299
You never know.

295
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,299
It could be anybody.

296
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,299
It could be anything.

297
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,299
And we got some calm stuff going on.

298
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,299
No one really going for any large-scale moves here.

299
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:23,299
Except we got a corner match with less than two seconds to go before we get crowded again with six contestants.

300
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,299
And here comes number 12.

301
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,480
Your most celebrated president in United States history.

302
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,480
The eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren.

303
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,299
Now the real question is, how many people just Googled this fucking guy's name right now?

304
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,299
I'm going to say like 50% of the entire audience watching.

305
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:47,299
But anyways, Martin Van Buren showing up to overcrowd this already crowded ring.

306
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,299
And it looks like the Milkman's in some trouble.

307
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,299
Mario's going to dip the Milkman out.

308
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,299
Thank God.

309
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,539
If there is a Lord, he just showed it.

310
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,539
Because now the Milkman has no chance of winning this Rumble.

311
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,539
And Van God damn Buren showing in here.

312
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:03,539
Going to try and get picked up with a belly-to-belly suplex by Earthworm Jim.

313
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,539
Mela just kind of sitting there watching and waiting.

314
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,539
And Mela is kind of an interesting character.

315
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,539
Because he's real.

316
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,539
Obviously he's a real person.

317
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,539
Van Buren is also real.

318
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:14,539
And I guess you could say Mario is as well.

319
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:15,539
But how do you compete?

320
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,539
How do you cope knowing that there are plenty of these supernatural superhuman characters in here.

321
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,539
And you have to go against them.

322
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,539
And you might even have to kill them.

323
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:25,539
Or you might get killed by one of them.

324
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,539
We have not...

325
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,539
That's not unheard of.

326
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,019
Last time, if you remember, Bat Boy, Benjamin Franklin did kill him.

327
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,019
Benjamin Franklin ran him over with a truck.

328
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,019
And unfortunately, Benjamin Franklin is now in state penitentiary.

329
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,019
But it can be said, this does get dangerous.

330
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:48,019
And what a masterful double DDT on both Earthworm Jim and the Easter Bunny by Mario.

331
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,019
That was fantastic.

332
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,019
I don't know how he did that.

333
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:52,019
He kind of just grabbed them both by the head and just leaned back.

334
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,019
And his fat ass body just dragged everybody down to the ground.

335
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,019
Which is what you'd like to see.

336
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:58,019
And getting crowded again.

337
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,019
Here we go.

338
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,019
Another person coming down.

339
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,019
This one is going to be number 13.

340
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,019
And you all know who this is.

341
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,019
I don't even need to introduce this guy.

342
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,019
He looks pretty mad.

343
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,019
Looks pretty mean.

344
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:11,019
It's the Red Heavy from Team Fortress 2.

345
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,190
Not exactly sure why he has those bullets attached to him.

346
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,190
Because it kind of could get in the way in this arena.

347
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,190
It doesn't have a gun.

348
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,190
No guns are allowed at the Jerma Arena during these wrestling events.

349
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,190
But he's here.

350
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,190
And he's in the final ten.

351
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,190
So that means he has a significant chance.

352
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:33,190
Everybody in the ring right now has a significantly higher chance to win this rumble than the previous ten people.

353
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,190
That's how it works.

354
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,190
It's unfair.

355
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,190
It's unfortunate.

356
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:41,190
But if you are in the last ten people to be introduced while Earthworm Jim almost goes out.

357
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,190
Then you have a higher chance to win.

358
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,190
A much higher chance.

359
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,190
You're fresh.

360
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,190
You're prepared.

361
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,190
You're ready.

362
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,190
You haven't been fighting for long.

363
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,190
You can just get in there and do everything you can to try to win.

364
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,500
And speaking of the Heavy.

365
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Heavy for some reason went immediately a beeline right for Super Mario.

366
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
No one's really sure.

367
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Choking him now on the ropes.

368
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
And he's going to dip him over.

369
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
No.

370
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
I think you know what the problem is.

371
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I think Mario Bia is just way too heavy.

372
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
You can't dump somebody over like that.

373
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
But you can do a big boot to Van Buren.

374
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
And that's how you eliminate Van Buren.

375
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
He is gone.

376
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Sayonara.

377
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,740
Go get yourself a haircut you Wolverine looking old bastard.

378
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
Earthworm Jim in the meantime lying on the ground.

379
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
The Heavy favoring that left knee.

380
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,740
We all know that Earthworm Jim has had knee trouble in the past.

381
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
And the Heavy is definitely exploiting that.

382
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Well you have the Easter Bunny on the right there.

383
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
No.

384
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Bia didn't want to do anything about that.

385
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,740
Which is a little ridiculous considering he could have had an elimination under his belt.

386
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
But we're going to do number 14.

387
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
Number 14 is Season Boxing Veteran.

388
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
He's doing all kinds of shadow boxing.

389
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
He's ready.

390
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,740
He's been training.

391
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
As you can tell he's only been doing the bench press when he works out.

392
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
Ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,039
The Coathanger.

394
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,600
Coathanger is one of the stronger characters.

395
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Probably a top seed because of his sheer upper body strength.

396
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,600
All the while the Easter Bunny takes a fist right to the face going over that top turnbuckle area.

397
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
He is not happy about that.

398
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Easter Bunny say goodbye while a belly to back suplex by the Heavy is keeping Mela in check.

399
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Who is still here.

400
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Mela has been in this a long time.

401
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Him and Earthworm Jim have spent quite a long time in the ring.

402
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Here's hoping they can keep their energy levels up because we're coming down to number 15.

403
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,600
The last five entrants of the Jerma Rumble are coming in from this point forward.

404
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,600
So let's take a look at who number 15 is.

405
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Number 15.

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
The crowd is going crazy right now.

407
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
The crowd is so riled up.

408
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm not sure who this is.

409
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Who could do such a huge response.

410
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,970
It's Captain Crunch.

411
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,269
Captain Crunch is in the arena.

412
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,269
He doesn't give a shit if you think his cereal is way too sugary.

413
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,269
He's going to come down.

414
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,269
He's going to drop kick the fuck out of your grandmother.

415
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,269
It's Captain Crunch ladies and gentlemen.

416
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,269
The keeper.

417
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,269
The number one seed.

418
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,269
I knew we were going to be getting some surprises here.

419
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,269
But I did not expect the captain to make it happen.

420
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:55,269
Let's hope he does.

421
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,700
And not only the crowd.

422
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Once Captain Crunch got in here.

423
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
The contestants are now riled up.

424
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Doing moves left and right.

425
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,700
It was kind of catatonic until the captain came in.

426
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Doing a slinging neck breaker slam on Earthworm Jim.

427
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
We've got a large punch.

428
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
We've got a lot of things going on.

429
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
All kinds of stuff happening in the Jerma Arena.

430
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Captain Crunch really decided to rile things up.

431
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Mela picking up the heavy.

432
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Power slamming him down.

433
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
We've got two power slams.

434
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Belly to belly suplex.

435
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Action left and right here in the arena.

436
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
What a fantastic display of athleticism going on here.

437
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,700
I think that large surge of the crowd just reminded all the contestants that this is for keeps.

438
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
This is going on.

439
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
One of these people has a high chance to win.

440
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Earthworm Jim setting up the kick.

441
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
There goes the coat hanger.

442
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Take it easy.

443
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
See you next week.

444
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
See you next fall.

445
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Get the fuck out of here.

446
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Earthworm Jim for the win.

447
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,880
We've got Captain Crunch now whipping the heavy into the corner.

448
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Reversal does not look good for the captain.

449
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Getting picked up in a power bomb.

450
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Maybe going over the top.

451
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
No.

452
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Straight down in the back.

453
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
No, he's going to do it again.

454
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
He's going to do it again.

455
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
The captain.

456
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Two power bombs.

457
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
He's going to go for a third one.

458
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
A third power bomb on Captain Crunch.

459
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
That's got to hurt.

460
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
The heavy is a very big man.

461
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
And a moonsault.

462
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
A backflip by Earthworm Jim.

463
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
And we've got another competitor coming down.

464
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
And did you see that super kick?

465
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Mela just went over the top rope.

466
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
It's Santa Claus with a chainsaw.

467
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Shit is getting insane here in the German arena.

468
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
You've got Santa Claus with a chainsaw.

469
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
You've got people flying over the top turnbuckle.

470
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Somebody get that thing away from him before he hurts somebody.

471
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Santa Claus from the North Pole.

472
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Obviously shit-faced.

473
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Get that thing away from him before he hurts somebody.

474
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
Security doing your damn job and get that.

475
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Thank you.

476
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Somebody did he drop it?

477
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
I think he just dropped it.

478
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Somebody pick that up so that nobody gets hurt.

479
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Thank you.

480
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,059
Santa Claus coming in.

481
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,059
Welcome from the North Pole, like I said.

482
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,059
Throwing the heavy over almost.

483
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,059
And he's going right for the heavy.

484
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,059
Two of the biggest guys in here right now.

485
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,059
Santa and the heavy.

486
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,059
Looks like Captain Crunch might be going out.

487
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,059
Earthworm Jim had a chance there.

488
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,059
But the heavy stopped it.

489
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,059
He gets a belly-to-belly suplex for his trouble.

490
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,059
And so does the captain.

491
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,420
Wow.

492
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,420
That last couple minutes was pretty ridiculous.

493
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,420
And it's only going to get more ridiculous seeing as how we still have four people left that need to come in.

494
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:13,420
We have 17, 18, 19, and then 20 is left on the table while the heavy gets on top of Mario just punching him in the face.

495
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,420
And Mario's been here for a while.

496
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Earthworm Jim's been here for a while.

497
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
We just lost Mela.

498
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Mela right before Santa came in took a massive kick to the face and flew over the top rope like I've never seen before.

499
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
He went flying.

500
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
And 10 seconds are on the clock.

501
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
Belly-to-belly suplex on Santa.

502
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Got a punching miss.

503
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
A couple of misses there by Earthworm Jim.

504
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Receives a clothesline for his trouble.

505
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,420
Heavy almost goes over.

506
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
And we've got another contestant coming in.

507
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,859
At number 17, it is the King.

508
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:44,859
The King is in the building.

509
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:45,859
Uh-huh.

510
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:46,859
It is Elvis.

511
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:52,859
Elvis Presley showing us some sparkles with his wonderful, wonderful getup he has here.

512
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,859
This is Fat Elvis.

513
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,859
You know, this is not like in shape handsome Elvis.

514
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,859
This is Elvis impersonator fat guy Elvis.

515
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:04,859
I figured that would be a little bit better if he came to the arena rather than the actual in shape one.

516
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:06,859
But Elvis Presley is in the arena.

517
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:07,859
He's in the building.

518
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:08,859
King is in the building.

519
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,859
And there goes Earthworm Jim.

520
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,859
No.

521
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:14,859
Earthworm Jim, he just went straight over.

522
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:16,099
And what is Santa Claus doing?

523
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,099
Santa Claus is picking up Mario.

524
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:21,099
Santa Claus just threw him over the top with no effort at all.

525
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:25,269
He picked him up like a baby and then just dropped him over the top rope.

526
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:26,269
That was insane.

527
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:28,269
And nobody was able to do that.

528
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:33,269
So many people tried to throw Mario out, but it just didn't work because he was essentially too heavy.

529
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,269
Santa Claus ain't going to mess around.

530
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,269
Santa Claus is like seven feet tall, so that does not bother him really at all.

531
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,269
And Elvis here looks like Captain Crunch might be trying to set up something, pushing him out of the ring.

532
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,269
Elvis is going to be gone right before he came out.

533
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,269
He's gone.

534
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,269
Elvis is gone within a minute of coming in.

535
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,269
And now there are three and we are coming down to the final three people.

536
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:57,269
And one of those final people is going to be in a towel.

537
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,450
Apparently forgot to put clothes on.

538
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,450
Probably just got out of the shower.

539
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,450
And it doesn't care that he's almost totally naked, but that's fine.

540
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,450
Showing off some of his fireworks.

541
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,450
That is, of course, Burger Boy.

542
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,450
Number 18.

543
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,450
This is a fantastic position to be in.

544
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,450
He is one of the final two.

545
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,450
And right at the moment, right as he comes in, the heavy is gone.

546
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,819
Santa Claus eliminates the heavy.

547
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,819
Santa Claus just tossing everybody out left and right.

548
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,819
Nobody has a chance against Santa Claus.

549
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,819
This is unbelievable.

550
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,819
There are three now in the ring with two more to come in.

551
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,819
Captain Crunch, Santa Claus, and Burger Boy.

552
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,819
And they are double teaming Burger Boy right now.

553
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,819
And no, it doesn't seem like it wanted to do a little bit of false security there for Santa.

554
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:38,819
Could Captain Crunch eliminate Santa right now?

555
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,819
It looks like if this one guy is going to do it, no, he gets interrupted by Burger Boy.

556
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,819
No, Captain Crunch just barely goes out.

557
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:49,819
And we have 10 seconds before somebody else comes in.

558
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:51,819
This is crunch time.

559
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,819
This is crunch time.

560
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,819
Burger Boy is now on the offensive, but he's going to just with the skin of his teeth get it.

561
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:00,180
And here comes Jerma.

562
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,180
Jerma 985.

563
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
There he is.

564
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Last time's champion, the defending champion, Jerma 985.

565
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:12,180
Looking as sexy and delicious as always coming down to the arena at this moment.

566
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
And you got to believe he wants another title.

567
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,619
Has another fantastic position to be in, taking Santa Claus for a ride.

568
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,619
And if you remember last rumble, Jerma was one of the final people.

569
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:26,619
And the last one as well, giving him a huge advantage.

570
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:28,619
And he could very well win this one again.

571
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,619
We could see a repeat by Jerma winning the second rumble.

572
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:34,619
It's anybody's game, though.

573
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,619
Santa Claus is one of the top competitors out of nowhere.

574
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:40,619
Santa Claus became the top seed.

575
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,619
It was going to be Captain Crunch, but he still is in it.

576
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,619
It was going to be Codehanger.

577
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:45,619
We just don't know.

578
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:47,619
You never know what the hell is going to happen in the Jerma rumble.

579
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,619
Anything could happen.

580
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,619
Anything could happen indeed, which the theory might be proven right here.

581
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:54,619
It is.

582
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:55,619
Jerma has been eliminated.

583
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,619
Jerma is not going to win this one.

584
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:58,619
No repeat for Jerma.

585
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,619
And the final contestant is now making their way down to the arena.

586
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,619
Fire and brimstone.

587
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,619
This looks kind of eerie.

588
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,619
Who could this be coming straight from hell?

589
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:13,309
The egg coming up straight from the fire of hell.

590
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,309
He lives in hell.

591
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,309
He breeds in hell.

592
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:18,450
He just, he...

593
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,390
What's that?

594
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,390
We're getting word here, guys.

595
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,390
Apparently, a massive commotion going on backstage.

596
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,390
Jerma985 is tearing backstage.

597
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,390
Do we have any cameras back there?

598
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,390
I'd like to know what he's doing back there.

599
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,630
That's Glooman.

600
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,809
That's Glooman walking to his car.

601
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,809
He has nothing to do with this, Jerma.

602
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:35,809
You psychopath.

603
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:36,809
What's wrong with you?

604
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:38,809
Glooman wasn't even part of the festivities today.

605
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:39,809
You didn't win.

606
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:40,809
It's too...

607
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:41,809
Jesus Christ.

608
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,109
Jerma is on an absolute rampage right now because he didn't win the rumble.

609
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,109
Get security back there right now for crying out loud.

610
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:51,109
We got action in the ring going on here.

611
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,109
Burger Boy is out.

612
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:55,109
Burger Boy has been eliminated by Captain Crunch,

613
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,109
and Santa Claus is holding up for dear life.

614
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,109
Santa Claus is out.

615
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:01,109
Here are your final two, the last two.

616
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,109
You've got Captain Crunch, and you've got the egg.

617
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,109
It's the battle of the breakfast.

618
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,109
This, nobody saw this coming.

619
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,109
Nobody thought that the breakfast people were going to be the ones,

620
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:13,109
the two small, five feet tall people.

621
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:17,349
I'm in shock right now, but let's get it started.

622
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:22,349
One of these two is going to be crowned new Jerma Rumble champion,

623
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,349
and there is no telling on which one.

624
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:26,349
Beautiful belly-to-belly suplex overhead.

625
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:29,349
Recovering from that punch was Captain Crunch,

626
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,349
and another scooping side slam.

627
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,349
Captain Crunch can taste it.

628
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:33,349
He can feel it.

629
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:35,349
I think Captain's going to make it happen.

630
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,349
Do we think Captain's going to make it happen?

631
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,349
He's going to push him on the top rope here.

632
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,349
Can Captain Crunch win the Jerma Rumble?

633
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,349
Is he going to do it?

634
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,349
It's so close.

635
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,349
No, he just barely ducks underneath it.

636
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,349
The egg still has a little bit of fire under his ass.

637
00:24:47,349 --> 00:24:50,349
Can we see a victory here by either one of these two?

638
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:51,349
One of them will win.

639
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:53,349
The question is, which one?

640
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:57,349
And in the corner now, Captain Crunch has got the egg in the corner,

641
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:58,349
kind of where he wants him.

642
00:24:58,349 --> 00:24:59,349
Let's hope something can happen.

643
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:00,349
He's going to tip him over.

644
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:03,349
Captain Crunch has got the egg on the ropes.

645
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:05,960
He didn't do it.

646
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Oh, the egg is calling for timeout.

647
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,200
What a bastard.

648
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
He called for timeout, and he's going to get to his advantage.

649
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
He called for timeout.

650
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
What a disgusting cheap shot that was.

651
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Captain Crunch was going to give him the timeout,

652
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,200
and I hope it does not make Captain Crunch lose this battle,

653
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
because that was just absolutely disgusting on the eggs part,

654
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
and the egg now is lying down.

655
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Seems to be winded.

656
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Captain Crunch has a chance here.

657
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Ring that victory bell.

658
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Captain Crunch has just won the second ever Jerma Rumble.

659
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
What a show.

660
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,130
I am blown away by everything here tonight,

661
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,130
and congratulations, Captain Crunch,

662
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,130
for the second ever Jerma Rumble victory,

663
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,130
and I'll see you guys all next time.

664
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,130
Thank you all so much for watching.

665
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,130
I really do appreciate it.

666
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,430
Take care, everybody.
