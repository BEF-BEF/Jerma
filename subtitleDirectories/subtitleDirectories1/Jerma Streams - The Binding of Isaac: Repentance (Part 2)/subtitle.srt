1
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:38,729
Hello, how's it going? Let me tweet. Isaac late night hogchamp? No, no, no, no, no, no,

2
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:51,750
it's too late for hogchamp. Is there like a sleepy or like slightly excited hogchamp? Like a ooh,

3
00:00:52,549 --> 00:01:05,000
is there an ooh, ooh? Oh, that one. Yeah, that one's not bad. It was like, oh, the hands up.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,010
Like, here we are. What is that one called? Hypers. Oh, hypers. Okay, okay, okay. All right,

5
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:57,769
give me a second. I'm gonna tweet. Hello. Yeah, I was going to stream tomorrow, but I felt like

6
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:05,109
going right now. A new philosophy on the channel is if I feel like streaming, I'm just going to do

7
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:12,219
it. I could be at energy level of zero or energy level of 10. Whenever I just feel like doing it

8
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:20,699
is when we're going to do it. I was hoping you were going to play this. I've been trying to find

9
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:30,330
a way to play this. Oh, also, this is not on switch. I hooked up the switch and I realized,

10
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:38,840
all right, how many of you? I mean, maybe I'm maybe this is just me. I have the binding of Isaac.

11
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:47,300
I have bought the binding of Isaac more than I bought GTA 5. Remember when GTA 5 came out

12
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:55,020
and then it came out again and came out again and came out again. I had it on across like

13
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,930
multiple generations of consoles. I had it on steam. I had it on my switch. I think I even had

14
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:09,610
it on an Xbox and I thought, oh, the switch one that I have is the one with my save file with all

15
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,849
of my stuff because my steam one does not have a lot of the repentance stuff on blocked because I

16
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,099
didn't really play repentance that much, but I did. I thought I did play it on the switch,

17
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:27,590
but it turns out I don't even own the game on switch. I own up until rebirth, I think on

18
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:35,189
switch. So I'm like, what's going on? Oh shit. It's probably on like an Xbox, like an Xbox one.

19
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:41,349
Oh, I don't know. I don't know where my save file is, but that's the way it is. So what I did

20
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:50,150
and do not, do not think I am a gamer. I got a save file and it's an unlock for everything. It's

21
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:58,740
as if I completed the game a million percent. I just wanted to do some runs and I'm probably

22
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,560
going to get destroyed. Cheater, cheater, cheater. Yeah, I know. All right. Let me ask you this.

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,259
Let's do this right now. Let's do it right now. But I don't know. Nobody. All right.

24
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm going to veto this poll if I don't like it. Do you want me to start from the very beginning

25
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,920
from zero and Isaac, or would you rather let's just go and let's just play and everybody has

26
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:30,949
already seen this a thousand times, right? Like I've played this game. Binding of Isaac is probably

27
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:37,899
my second or third most played game ever. It's probably Team Fortress, Diablo two,

28
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,050
Binding of Isaac and maybe Warcraft. I have so much time in this game. Let's just play it. Yeah.

29
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:59,779
Yeah. Fuck it. Whatever. That's the plan. We're just going to hang out and play. I've never seen

30
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:09,050
Binding of Isaac gameplay. Really? Wow. Well, the game's fantastic. No, I've definitely played this

31
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,449
more than house flipper for sure. I've played this off stream hundreds and hundreds of times

32
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:25,290
over the course of the last five, 10 years. Can you wait 10 minutes? I need to take a shower.

33
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:35,189
No, I'll give you two. That's not enough to take a shower, but don't worry.

34
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:44,389
We're going to, I'm just going to hang it up. That's pretty windy too. Windy here in Vegas.

35
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:54,149
You might hear it. Are you going to play with funny mods on? Not right now. I think it's more

36
00:05:54,149 --> 00:06:11,720
play. I had a dream where you were on a tour of black Mesa from Half-Life and on stream and you

37
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:26,550
got killed by a laser. Stop eating before bed. True. Same. Same. How long am I going to stream

38
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:34,860
for? I don't know. A couple hours, two, three hours. I don't know. Hey, my dog passed away in

39
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:47,500
December. Sorry to hear that. Name was Bud. Oh, RIP Bud. Sorry to hear that. Hey, do you know that

40
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,939
you were nominated for streamer of the year? I am aware of that and I, I can't believe it. I'm

41
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:07,290
shocked. I honestly did not expect that at all. And whatever happens, happens. I think that just

42
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:14,069
being on that list is a win. So I'm happy just being on that list. A lot of people did a lot

43
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:21,420
of unbelievable things this year. So yeah, that's, I already see it. That's a win for me already.

44
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:44,060
And also too, I want to just make sure to say, I know that that's a, that's like a big award.

45
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:54,519
Um, just be respectful, right? That, that's a very, that's a very hot award. Um, and win or lose,

46
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:06,379
I'm all right. Don't worry. Just be respectful about it, please. But no, it's, it's, it's,

47
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:09,740
that's awesome. That's fucking crazy. I don't even know what to say. It's hard to even say

48
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:28,100
anything about it, but hell yeah. It's 10 PM, dude. Yeah, it is. I'm going to play some Isaac.

49
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,379
Do you, do you call it a cold headache or a brain freeze? Definitely a brain freeze.

50
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:45,190
100% brain freeze. Brain freeze sounds way worse and it feels way worse than a cold headache.

51
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,779
Cold headache to me is a headache is something that lasts more than an hour.

52
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,480
Brain freeze is instant. It's awful. It's painful. It's a brain freeze. It's a freeze. It's not a

53
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,559
headache. Lasts about 10 to 15 seconds. God, I just got the feeling. Did you just feel it?

54
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:18,059
Oh, anytime I think of the word brain freeze, my roof of my mouth hurts. You peaked at among us.

55
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:26,820
Yeah, that's all right. I'm cool with that. That's, that's, I'm all right with that. That's fine.

56
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:38,019
Hey, you know what? If I've peaked at among us, that means I've peaked, right? And hitting a peak

57
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,379
is kind of cool. Don't you think? That's pretty cool. Peaking implies that you hit some form

58
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:59,429
of high echelon, doesn't it? Very interesting. Some form of it. He hasn't even begun to peak.

59
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,779
But yeah, I don't want to speak too much about the Streamer Awards stuff. I'm

60
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:14,389
just happy to participate and obviously good luck to everybody. It's great. I, I remember being,

61
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,990
I was lying in bed when I was looking at the awards and I was like, oh, cool. Like,

62
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,230
look at all these nominees. This is really awesome. Oh, the baseball show got nominated.

63
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:29,450
Oh, that's so cool. Baseball. Cool. Streamer event. So that's cool. And then I got to the,

64
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,169
and I was like, oh, okay. I won League of their own last year. And I saw the nominees. There's,

65
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:39,529
oh, okay. Cool. Perfect. All right. Cool. There we go. Stream event. All right. I wonder if maybe,

66
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:47,240
maybe I got a chance. Although chest boxing was fucking unbelievable. Right. And then I got to

67
00:10:47,240 --> 00:11:00,379
the bottom of the list. I said, oh fuck, I'm on this one. I was like, oh shit. But yeah,

68
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:11,929
that's all I'm going to say about it. Humble Andy. No, I mean, let's be really, really real

69
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:22,710
for a second. I, I don't even know how to explain it, describe it. It's, it's really cool,

70
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:44,870
but it's overwhelming too. Does that make sense? It's incomprehensible. Humble Harry. Oh, I bet

71
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:55,799
they're done with the shower now. Yeah, that's true. Well, look, it's easy. It's, when you look

72
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:03,269
at what a lot of people have been doing on this platform, I'm just glad to celebrate as many

73
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:08,700
people as we can. I think it's really cool. When Cutie decided that this is something that she

74
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:16,759
wanted to do, it's just like, oh, like an award show. That's not like a, it's fan voted and it's

75
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,100
a bunch of streamers get together and kind of hang out for, for a night. And it's just cool.

76
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:30,220
It's cool. And being in any of those lists or even being, even being invited to that event is

77
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:44,679
just like, oh shit. Okay, cool. So yeah, that's, that's how I feel. Are you going to wear the same

78
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:53,820
suit? Uh, I was, I have a, I had a specific request. I believe it was, uh, it was Jake.

79
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:06,200
Jake said, wear a different suit this year. I was like, all right, I gotta get, I gotta get like

80
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:15,960
tailored, right? I don't know. I'm gonna show up in fucking tube socks and like a pair of shorts.

81
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:30,659
Wear a tuxedo? No, I cannot pull a tux off. No way. I don't, I don't know if I like the way

82
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:38,039
I look in a tux. I kind of look like a goofball on a tux. All right, let's, uh, let's go.

83
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,840
You guys ready? I know people are going to look, people are going to think that I am an

84
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,970
unbelievable video game player. And you see this shit. I even, it's hard for me to look at this,

85
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,320
right? Ready? Oh, new run. Oh, cool. Yeah. Look at all this. Look, I did all this.

86
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:10,460
I did all of this. I'm very, I'm so good at this game. Oh, also, I want to talk about this for

87
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,789
just a second. There's going to be, uh, people have a lot of questions about Grotto Beasts.

88
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,490
And as we get closer to being able to really announce the launch, which like I said, is this

89
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,210
end of February, this, it's this end of February into the first week of March,

90
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:37,899
is this like this target here. You're going to see a lot of stuff. I think, uh, the Grotto Beasts

91
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,860
team is working on an FAQ to help answer a bunch of questions. Obviously I'm going to be talking

92
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,179
about a lot. There's some really, really, really cool shit that you'll see eventually here very

93
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:58,779
soon. All right. Some of these characters I've never even heard of. Let's, let's see. I've,

94
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:08,379
I've never played with this character. I don't know who this is. Uh, I'll be honest. I'd say

95
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:18,940
if I played a thousand games of Binding of Isaac, 900 of them were on Cain. Like R1. What is it?

96
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:29,750
What does this mean? What is this? I don't like that. Is that like super mode? Is that insane

97
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:39,850
mode? I don't know what any of this means. Maybe I shouldn't have done this. I don't know what any

98
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:58,549
of this does. It's alternative characters. Oh, this is crazy. Cain is boring. Well, we got to

99
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:01,590
just, let me just get back. Let me get back in the swing of things here. We're going to go Cain

100
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:11,740
in greed mode. Yeah. Cain on greed mode. Just to start. I got to remember how to play the game.

101
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:26,019
I remember a lot about it. This is like one of my favorite games. You picked the wrong one.

102
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:36,259
Look, I'm, I'm a Cain player. Oh, by the way, I also have a cheat sheet open here. That's a good

103
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:47,620
start. Wait, where's my, where is it? There it is. Okay. There you go. I like looking at that.

104
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:57,669
Is it Cain main? Yeah. It hurts. No, it doesn't. Go ahead and get that started. Now let's go cheat

105
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:08,099
sheet. It hurts. This is the, okay. Taking damage causes Isaac to fire a circle of 10 tiers around

106
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:19,509
him dealing 10 damage. Okay. So when you get hurt, you fire tears. What the fuck is going on? Cheater.

107
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:31,559
If you're playing Isaac without a cheat sheet of what items do, you are an encyclopedia. There's a

108
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,660
good mod that just gives you that cheat sheet info in the game. Oh, that's so perfect. How hard is

109
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:48,460
it to get? Is it like, is it like, is it a simple, like two second download? It's like, it's simple.

110
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:56,069
It's a steam download. It's a steam mod. It's super simple. Go to the menus and enable it in

111
00:17:56,069 --> 00:18:00,339
the workshop. Okay. All right. Uh, yeah. I'll do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,339
That's fine. Let's let the, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,660
All right. Give me what I, you know what? Hey, start a stream starting soon. I'll be back in a

114
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:24,250
second. What is it called by the way? Does it have a name? What is it called? External item

115
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:43,539
descriptions. Steam workshop. Okay. Workshop. It's called. No, it's not. All right. It is

116
00:18:43,539 --> 00:19:11,190
external item descriptions. Oh, the links like there. How do I open this link in steam? Is it

117
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:36,180
just like on the front page? Uh, where's like most popular install the POG mod? Oh, I don't want to

118
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:46,460
do a bunch of mods. I don't know. I don't know what they all do. How do I open this in the

119
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,940
workshop? Okay. It's, it's got like a, here's the name. It's like a, it starts with this.

120
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:14,180
All right. There we go. What does rep mean? Rep. R.I.P. Oh, repentance. Okay. Does this,

121
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:24,299
does this work for, um, okay. Yeah, it does. There it is. All right. Subscribe.

122
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:58,140
It'd be good to go. Right? Right. Mods. External item descriptions. So is it press tab to enable

123
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:18,519
mods. That's on now. All right. Sick. Let's go. No, it's off. Is it on? All right. So let's, uh,

124
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:34,569
new game. Read. Kane. I've never heard of this before. Okay. Holy shit. That's so good. Imagine

125
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:46,680
ever playing this game without this turned on, right? That is life changing. I've had that.

126
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:53,460
There's a, there's a few websites. There's like wikis. There's that platinum god and it's always

127
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:02,490
you look for the item. I, I've spent a minute, two, three minutes straight looking for the icon.

128
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:15,210
Wow. All right. That's unbelievable. Thank you. Appreciate it. POG mod is also fun. Yeah. I

129
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:22,970
remember looking through and not being able to find that item in the icon list and just being

130
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,690
like, Olly, can you, can you use your, can you help me? Can you use my, can you, I need a second

131
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:34,440
pair of eyes. All right. Tempers and she's just slowing tears. I wonder if there's a chance. Ooh.

132
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,740
Okay. All right. This is not a bad start. That's a lot of damage. I only have one heart though.

133
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:53,509
Oh, this might be bad. That's so cool. All right. I just gotta go for it. It's been a while. Just

134
00:22:53,509 --> 00:23:06,329
don't get hit. Just don't get hit. Is it, you know, also I'm going to sit back in my chair

135
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,450
because I really, I feel like Isaac is the kind of game where I need to sit far away.

136
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:27,769
The closer I am, the worse I do. Just don't get hit. So this is, the greedier mode is way harder,

137
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:35,559
but we're going to, we're going to start with this first. I remember greedier mode was rage

138
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:53,269
inducing sometimes. Greedier sucks. They just give you less money and the boss at the end has

139
00:23:53,269 --> 00:24:07,059
a second phase and it's awful. But greed is my favorite mode in the game. If you count all the

140
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:16,299
hours I've spent in this game, most of them are probably here. Okay. Uh, let's go. It's a horrible

141
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:24,009
take. That's fine. I'll be the weirdo that likes this more than anything else. How's auto? Auto's

142
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:35,380
good. All right. Do I, I definitely, I need this unfortunately. Ooh, wait, this is a good one.

143
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:44,380
That's health and tears up. Oh yeah. Play red dead, undead nightmare. I've been in the middle

144
00:24:44,380 --> 00:25:00,809
of a burp for five straight seconds. No. Okay. I'm good. Pretty good damage so far.

145
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:26,710
Just burp already. Yeah, but sometimes it takes a little while. Oh, four seconds is bad. Oh my

146
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:37,450
God. I hate those little things. They, I feel like they take so long to kill. Those things sit at zero

147
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:53,960
HP for, it seems like an eternity. The rest of the stuff in here is kind of junk, isn't it?

148
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:09,480
Random stat up, random stat down. Yeah, this thing sucks. I need a bomb. This is, this is bad. Look

149
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,700
at all this money that's left on the table here. That really sucks. This would probably be like

150
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:26,740
another 10 cents at least spike room. I'm, I only have two hearts. I'm afraid to go in here,

151
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:38,170
but I'm gonna, I'm gonna, whatever. And that's exactly why you go in. That's why you do that.

152
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:43,509
Uh, I can't get them both, but I will be able to get them both. Thank you. Is it, is it up? There

153
00:26:43,509 --> 00:27:18,259
you go. Secret room. HP tears up, shot speed down. What kind of bad, you're going to be pissing up a

154
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:23,319
storm later. Sorry to be the, oh, you're not talking to me. All right. I'm going to be,

155
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,400
is, this is stupid. This is a really bad idea because I would, I should save this for the other

156
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:50,220
floor, but I'm going for it. I don't care. Not a bad trade. Uh, Kane's, Kane, I fucked up. Uh,

157
00:27:50,220 --> 00:28:01,990
Kane starts with a paper clip, which opens up chests. All right. Whoops. Hey, it's all right.

158
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:22,710
Worked out. What a fake Kane main. Uh-oh. I got one hit. I haven't played in a while either.

159
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:33,740
You guys are going to have to help me when eventually we get to the part where, um, you

160
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,980
know, it's like, Oh, go down this hallway to get to this secret area, beat that secret area,

161
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,420
pick up that item and then bring that item to the next area and then go down the hole. And that's

162
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:54,470
how you get to delirious, whatever his name is. Cause I have no idea. Uh, I think that's actually

163
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:08,519
pretty good for here because I can use it every single, uh, spawn. Yeah. Every time a new wave

164
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:17,559
happens, I can do it again. Right? No tinted rocks. Don't miss anything. I have a key. I'm good. I

165
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,589
could check this wall here, but we're not going to do that. Cause it's a waste. All right, let's go.

166
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:36,779
I mean, I'm doing it here. Oh, what am I doing? Oops. Whatever. I could have done. It could have

167
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:56,309
been secret room. Just burnt my tongue. Dude. That sucks. Really? Ooh. Ouch. Ouch, man. That sucks.

168
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:12,539
What five damage up for each enemy killed in the room. Capsa plus. Oh, that's awesome. Especially

169
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:38,410
if you're green speed. Always good. Hmm. Is it? Well, I'm definitely going to get that.

170
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:46,150
It's a full day. Look, I have 7.2 damage is actually really good. Am I using a mod? Yep. Uh,

171
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:55,769
I just heard about this mod 15 minutes ago. So you open the blocks with the paper clip. Oh,

172
00:30:55,769 --> 00:31:08,630
you can't unfortunately, but yes, this mod just tells you what everything does. Well,

173
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:16,900
I definitely want that first. All right, let's go. Yeah. The whatever Guppy's head is, is pretty

174
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:47,400
awesome early game. You just do it every single spawn. What do you mean? Shadow is messing me up

175
00:31:47,400 --> 00:32:00,539
with a reflection or whatever. Oh, oh, fuck. I'm fine. I'm actually like freaking out right now.

176
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:32,890
Oh, all right. We're OK. OK, definitely this. All right. Uh, are the mod friend folio an entire

177
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:40,779
community expansion of the game? I lost the damage bonus that I had before. How did I have that?

178
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:52,950
How did I have that damage bonus? It was already a 7.2. Am I seeing things? I always got to left

179
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,079
the room, right? Shit. There we go. I got to I have to be good about that. Well, I had to leave

180
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:24,890
the room because if I take one hit, I would be dead. We're good. Build it back up. I'm not going

181
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:50,009
to leave. What? This reflective ground sucks. So I'm no screaming. It's fucking like it's late.

182
00:33:56,819 --> 00:34:09,340
This screwed me up. I didn't die. Somebody said F. No, I didn't. I hate this little thing.

183
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,340
This thing always kills me. Oh, my God. OK, that was a warm up.

184
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,940
OK, that's a warm up. That was just warming up. We're just warming up.

185
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,480
It's all right. Look, we're even going to get the same items. I get the same items.

186
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:53,980
Die to fire. I thought I put it out. Oh, that's kind of sad. Booster pack. Oh,

187
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:16,650
booster pack. Is it grotto beast? Not yet. Oh, what was that? What's this? What's this? What's

188
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:23,219
happening? What is this thing? What does this do? Oh, my God. What does this mean?

189
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:35,780
Should I stop freaking out? What does this mean? I've never seen this before. Get it fast.

190
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,699
Keep freaking out. That's the golden penny. It's a lot of money. It's just keep. No, no, no, no.

191
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:52,280
Keep freaking out. Keep freaking out. I'm going to get overwhelmed. I got to kill stuff. Will it

192
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:20,570
stay there? Oh, shit. It keeps responding until it stops. Oh, OK. I think it stopped. All right.

193
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,940
I think it's tough. I've never seen that before. I've never seen that. I think I think I'm going to

194
00:36:24,940 --> 00:37:16,869
die. You. OK, we're fine. That was crazy. Thirty three coins. Definitely this is the value on this

195
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:26,139
good. I feel like this is too random, although I could get the one that doubles the coins.

196
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:38,250
Yeah, let's do it. This is just hearts. This is the devil, which is this is double keys.

197
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:54,090
Ancient recall, draw three cards. Oh, my God. Death, the sun, the joker. Oh, the hierophant.

198
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:06,539
I guess I just double the keys and then double the keys. Right. Is this a way? Did I have to?

199
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:18,090
Now, this is the sun. This is. Should I buy a key and then double the keys? I can't. I'm just

200
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:26,489
going to do it of speed. It's a free key. And then this is just hearts. So who cares? This is

201
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:39,619
damage. Right. But who cares? I hold on to the sun. The sun card is the best one.

202
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:44,300
I'm going to hold on to the sun card. The rest of these. I don't think they really do very much.

203
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:51,210
Use the joker, the joker. OK, so the joker gives me a free item room. Right. Or is it the secret

204
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:59,429
room? Wait, let me read it. It reports Isaac to the devil or. Oh, yeah, but I'm going to do that

205
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:07,909
anyways. Just do it for free so I don't have to fight the nightmare thing. I guess that makes

206
00:39:07,909 --> 00:40:00,440
sense. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Come on. Forgot he did that move.

207
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:36,840
My range is awful. Why is my range so bad? Cane. Stinks. I mean, it's good. Yeah. All right. Let's

208
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:45,190
now let's go here. Sun cards, the thing to take. Yeah. Then I'm going to open the door.

209
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:57,500
Hell is the everything jar. Spawns pickups based on the number of charges. Charge one, two, three,

210
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:15,369
four, five. This item is based. That's really, really good. It's active. OK, so how many charges

211
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:29,500
should I really wait for then? Yeah, it's per room. Do it between nine charges. Is it gold?

212
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:37,980
Depends on what you need. Hold the map button. Oh, that's really cool. OK. Well, there's no reason

213
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:47,429
to do it for one. Two is a coin. Three is a bomb for. Wait, what is the. I forget what the gold.

214
00:41:47,510 --> 00:42:04,119
What is the gold bomb? Infinite bombs, infinite bombs for the whole floor. Oh, my God. OK.

215
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:18,340
Do not hold R. Hold the R button to activate POG mod. Oh, good for you. It's too bad you didn't

216
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,420
say that two minutes ago because I don't have the POG mod installed. That was a good attempt,

217
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:37,559
though. I do appreciate the attempt. Let's just go. I'm going to keep the sun. Oh, man.

218
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,750
You always have to look and see what those are, if it's possible, because if it's the double coins

219
00:42:43,750 --> 00:43:04,039
one, you win automatically in greed mode. I get a bomb. Use the devil one as a different card.

220
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:13,579
It is. Whoa. So I just use it. Oh, my God. I thought I thought the devil car was just damn well.

221
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:18,789
That's different. I've never unlocked that. Cool. Good thing I have somebody else's save file.

222
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:31,320
Nice. Let's go. Oh, it is. It is. Wait, put it down. Put it down. How do I put it down?

223
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,239
Hold. How do I put it down? How do I put it down? How do I put it down? How do I put this down?

224
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:43,079
You hold a button. It's hold R, isn't it? But I thought I can't. I thought don't hold R,

225
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:58,630
though. I thought everyone said don't hold R. R is reset. Oh, OK. We're good. That's what I

226
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:17,980
wanted. All right. So now what? What's this one? Shit. I can't take them both. All right. Well,

227
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm keeping it. It was a check. Oh, I thought I could only do it. All right. Sorry. We're good.

228
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,780
I don't need it. I'm going to be going to be dog shit in there anyways.

229
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:54,579
Oh, pretty good. Very good. Now I get to 40. I get to 50 coins and I get 100 coins and then

230
00:44:54,579 --> 00:45:08,219
we can just go on a complete shopping spree. That's why I love greed mode. Don't buy anything.

231
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:40,949
Just just I got to make sure I don't lose all matters. I can't even tell how many charges

232
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:55,750
that is. I wish it was just a number because the amount of real estate that you have to looking

233
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:03,130
up in the corner of the screen is like death. I pay attention. Just do it when it's over eight.

234
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:22,179
Nine. Should I do it now? What's that do? Do it nine always then, because that when that removes it,

235
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:32,090
it gives me health. Right. I mean, it gives me money. All right. I'm only shit. OK. I'm good.

236
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:52,059
Very cool. Give me some damage up. And this is pretty much a good game.

237
00:46:52,619 --> 00:47:04,860
Could be at least I think he does the bounce. Yep. Does it again. Sometimes you change it together

238
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:19,460
and it's annoying. Forty one. Try to get the habit so you get a charge every time you get hit.

239
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:33,909
Take the devil deal. Hold on. I could do it now. Would you be close enough? Right.

240
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:45,619
Yeah, I'm going to do it now. Here's up to point. I need the range up and it spawns a lucky penny.

241
00:47:50,139 --> 00:48:04,039
Nice. I needed that so badly. I want this for random. I don't like these. Let's just do.

242
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:22,619
No, it's not as good as I have. I key reroll. Hmm. Oh, what is this? Is that a smore?

243
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:35,099
I want the smore item. Must be charged. Oh, it must be charged by picking up soul hearts,

244
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:43,449
then spawns three soul hearts, two angel room items, only spawns two soul hearts and one angel

245
00:48:43,449 --> 00:48:56,710
item if a devil deal was taken previously. I don't think that's good here. Soul hearts.

246
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:00,469
Where am I going to get so I could make them, but it would take like that's not worth it.

247
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:18,250
Oh, wait, it doesn't know what this is. Oh, what is this? I know that was dumb,

248
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:23,829
but we could. But it could have been another double coin. You understand what I'm saying?

249
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:32,409
Enemies in current room are weakened, slowed and take double damage for one minute. Um, yeah.

250
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:39,530
What do you mean? No, what do you mean? No, it couldn't have. Yes, it could have.

251
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:47,000
You can read what it is. No, look in the corner, the question mark. No, you know. All right. All

252
00:49:47,000 --> 00:50:02,309
right. All right. All right. All right. I am ready to move. I've got enough and dominate this.

253
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:06,329
Quick tip for those of you that are a new dividing of Isaac. If it's two enemies,

254
00:50:06,329 --> 00:50:11,190
they share the same health pool, but focus one. Otherwise you'll have to handle two enemies the

255
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:30,340
entire health bar. Focus one first. Make sure to get that down. Three broken hearts. This is,

256
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:39,159
this one's like too confusing to me. Eh, I never liked the orbiting, uh, orbiting items.

257
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:46,699
The knife is good, but you have to, you have to walk up and I always screw it up and get hurt.

258
00:50:46,699 --> 00:50:51,179
All right. So what does a broke grants? Three broken hearts. So it's 0.75 damage.

259
00:50:52,619 --> 00:51:10,219
Every fatal hit. What is it? Does that mean when I die, it blocks me? I can't die. That seems kind

260
00:51:10,219 --> 00:51:22,920
of unbelievable, but it's going to lower your max HP. That's all right. It's going to be careful.

261
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:33,510
All right. Cool. I don't think I want anything else. It'd be nice to get these bombs. So why not?

262
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:51,989
Uh, I'm, it's worth the trade for me. I don't want the bombs. Well, broken hearts kills you.

263
00:51:51,989 --> 00:52:03,300
Yeah, but I'll be, I'm not, I'm not going to get hit. You see how, how much is,

264
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:19,510
what's happening here? Look at this. Crazy chocolate or honey Teddy grams. Um, I'm going

265
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:24,980
with straight up original when I haven't eaten any of these. I haven't eaten this in probably 20

266
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:42,500
years. That's good. Charm tears. 10%. Can't you press buttons really fast? Oh yeah. Fast enough.

267
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,659
Ooh, we got a sale. We got a sale. We got a sale is huge. Look at all this. All right. There's a way

268
00:52:48,659 --> 00:53:00,039
for me to do this with one bomb. Isn't there? Not. What is that? What does it pick up the bed?

269
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:38,519
Really? Wait, opens the door to the hush floor, regardless of the timer. Uh-huh. It's useless.

270
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:46,820
Could I go to fight the hush right now? Uh, I want to continue this. Wait, how much more?

271
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:52,380
I haven't even started to yet. Yeah. I'm just going to do it. I'm not going to use it.

272
00:53:52,380 --> 00:54:04,219
Battery. Shit. That's the good one. Isn't it? Active items can be charged up twice and used

273
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:25,750
twice in a row. This bar soap, the eraser. Um, these are all active items, aren't they? Just

274
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:42,469
reroll. I'll reroll. Ooh, this thing is really good. You get items for free with this thing.

275
00:54:42,469 --> 00:55:00,179
Definitely want that. And these are all kind of good. I think this is a win shaping up to be that

276
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:11,059
you see some more damage. Whoa, shit. Oh my God. My hands. Hold on a second. You ever just like sit

277
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:16,980
in your chair and like, for no reason, everything is insanely uncomfortable for like 10 straight

278
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,079
seconds. It's just like, wow, like everything. I hate sitting here right now. You know what I

279
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:33,260
mean? It's like, fuck. And then it goes away and everything's fine. That's so much money.

280
00:55:35,909 --> 00:56:15,079
I want to use it. Just keep rolling. As long as I don't do something stupid. This should be good.

281
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:42,340
Sure. I got a dentist appointment in the morning and I might have to have my wisdom teeth removed.

282
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:48,969
Um, I think pretty much everybody has to go through that. So don't worry. I had my wisdom

283
00:56:48,969 --> 00:57:05,829
teeth taken up. Range. Yeah. Those of you that are lucky to not even have wisdom teeth, right?

284
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:14,179
That can happen. You're lucky. That's good. I was born with no wisdom teeth. That's really good

285
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:22,820
because you don't have to do any of this shit. Yeah. Giga Chad. Yeah. Skill issue. Having wisdom

286
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:37,539
teeth is a skill issue. I want the range. Divorce papers plus one bone heart tears up. Spawns the

287
00:57:37,539 --> 00:57:58,940
mysterious paper trinket. What's the paper trinket? Is it any good? Bad. All right. I'm good.

288
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:09,219
This is, I got a good build right now. I don't mess it up. I couldn't even afford it anyways.

289
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:36,380
Yeah, that was easy. Oh, that's one of my favorite items. Purgatory. Red cracks spawn on the ground

290
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:45,099
of hostile rooms. Welcome to the crack. Someone's homing exploding. No. And then this. Oh, this is

291
00:58:45,099 --> 00:59:01,179
the one I lost. Does it take away the bad hearts? Of course not. Still really good. It's worth it.

292
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:15,530
I didn't go in here, but I'm not going to. All right, let's go. Okay. Well, I keep forgetting.

293
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:36,860
Speed up. Very good. It's okay. I feel like I have to take this. You missed a coin. Zero out of 10.

294
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:48,099
Where's there a coin? I didn't miss a coin. What are you talking about? In the Satan room?

295
00:59:48,099 --> 01:00:04,579
There was a coin in the devil room. What? You're lying. You're lying. Hold on. This is important.

296
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:08,980
Hey, just got word from the boss. If you lose this run, you are contractually obligated to

297
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:13,699
install the POG mod. Sorry, King. I don't make the rules. And then they're crunching. There's

298
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:29,050
a cat crunching on a brick and like emote eating a brick or something. Um, all right. I hate doing

299
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:42,250
this, but I have to. Oh, at least I know what it is. What about that one? Nice. Now what is this?

300
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:53,099
Bone heart. What just happened? Did it take my bone heart? Wait, my money. Oh fuck. Wait a minute.

301
01:00:53,099 --> 01:01:21,940
What? God damn it. Sorry. I don't need that. All it does is just makes your, uh, familiars

302
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:30,699
stick in much closer. Here's up range up and spawns three random hearts. Yes, I will take it.

303
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:46,550
And those are great. Those are great hearts to have. This is, this is really great. I should

304
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:56,889
absolutely wipe the floor with everything now. What is this? Mucormycosis. I'm terrified of this,

305
01:01:56,889 --> 01:02:07,059
but I'm going to get it. Explode. What the fuck is all this? Oh, I forgot. I didn't do this part.

306
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:55,190
Don't remind me that this is in here. All right. Pretty good. Very good actually. Whoa. And that

307
01:02:55,190 --> 01:03:36,329
hurt me. No. Okay. Good. Jesus. Yeah. I definitely going to win. There's no way I don't. Well,

308
01:03:36,329 --> 01:04:04,329
I mean, who knows? Who knows? Oh, Vinny. Vinny raid. Vinny raid. What's up? Vinesauce viewers.

309
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:12,900
Thanks to the Ray Vinny. We're just doing some late night Binding of Isaac. It's been a while

310
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:20,860
since I walked out of the room, but it's okay. We're good to go. Uh, if you've never played

311
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:27,619
Binding of Isaac, check it out. Card in the item room. Yeah. I'm not going anywhere yet.

312
01:04:27,619 --> 01:04:40,139
What was that? What was Vinny doing tonight? I made some friends in college

313
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:48,139
because we all enjoy your streams. That's really cool. That makes me happy. That makes me feel

314
01:04:48,139 --> 01:05:04,119
really great. Hope you guys become pretty good friends. Am I going to get coins if I do this?

315
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:13,510
No, they have to have coins in their eyes, right? All right. It's time for me to, uh,

316
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:20,139
activate this and then leave and everybody yelled at me because I missed an item. This actually is

317
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:35,019
kind of horrible. Hold on. Oh, I was mad and then I was happy. It hurt. It hurt, but I made a bunch

318
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:51,480
of money. What is this thing? Wow. Okay. Guppy's hairball. Moving swings the hairball around the

319
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:02,019
ball grows when it kills an enemy. Dude, these are both good because won't it just grow permanently

320
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:17,780
if I don't leave the room? Piercing tears and they ease this. Okay. All right. I don't want to

321
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:28,920
go too crazy here because I'm, I don't have that much help. It's deceiving. I feel like I should

322
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:47,219
probably get this. Okay. And then this too, right? Cause I get a half a soul heart every time a new

323
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:59,929
floor. Does that count when we're greed mode? D6 D6 rerolls, pedestal items. That's pretty good,

324
01:06:59,929 --> 01:07:08,500
but I, I feel like this thing is so much better. There's only two more floors. Yeah. So I think I

325
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:15,690
want to keep the money busted, dude. You have to get it. It's too late. It's too late for that.

326
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:24,599
Maybe next, uh, next fucking round, dude. I don't think I want anything. Yeah. I'm not shopping

327
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:39,559
anymore. Not about the money. Use the jar right now. This is seven. That's a card, right? Oh no.

328
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:55,860
Is it seven or eight? Use the jar and then get the D6. It shows what it is. Look in the jar. It has

329
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:05,780
the item. Late night hangout session. Just chilling. No, we don't, we don't, we're not

330
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:12,679
like paying that much attention to what's inside of the thing. Nah, no, I'm saving my money. No,

331
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:23,739
I don't want anything. I got, I still have another floor to go. Two more. Let's go. I'm leaving.

332
01:08:23,739 --> 01:08:42,680
Thank you. Bro. Bro. Bro. Shaking my head. Uh, how do I get rid of the menu on the right?

333
01:08:42,680 --> 01:09:00,939
I don't like that one. I like the one on the left. I like dog food. Nice. Remember

334
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:25,819
your tea. Oh shit. Thank you. Yes. Ooh, good. That's not so good, but that means I don't die.

335
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:46,020
Clearing rooms no longer charges active items. Feeling damage to enemy slowly fills up the

336
01:09:46,020 --> 01:10:04,569
charge bar. This one's good. Red stew. What is that? 21 damage up. The damage up wears off over

337
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:16,920
three minutes. Excuse me. Killing enemies while the effect is at. So will this last through the

338
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:29,779
next floor? Buy that at the end and speed run the last floor. All right. Yeah. I think that's,

339
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:38,039
I'm going to buy this at the end and then just rent through the rest of the game. Watch that

340
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:51,819
be the downfall. Wait, I hate this thing. The Ludovico technique. This thing's awful. This is

341
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:57,380
the worst item in binding of Isaac, isn't it? I think it actually might be the worst item in

342
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:14,760
the whole game. Yeah, I'm not taking it. I'm going to do this though. Really? All right. Let's go.

343
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:28,149
Oh my God. Absolutely. What an ungodly amount of damage. Just absolutely ungodly. I don't even

344
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:54,039
know what's on the screen. That person just spawned over here. Luckily. Holy shit. Okay.

345
01:11:55,819 --> 01:12:25,770
Don't leave. That's why this game gets so wacky. If you get the right materials, whatever. Shit.

346
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:41,609
I want an angel room for once. Oh, I thought it was the other way. I thought it was horizontal.

347
01:12:42,489 --> 01:12:58,279
You don't wait. What you have to skip. People were just spamming something. Call is really good.

348
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:13,579
You're going to one shot breed. Oh, okay. Okay. So I got 57 coins. I want to make sure I do this in

349
01:13:13,579 --> 01:13:42,779
the right order. Ooh, yes. Take reds. Take the 4.5 volt. Okay. I still want money for the end,

350
01:13:42,779 --> 01:14:05,609
right? Pill discount. Yeah, the pill sucks though. Throne keys deal damage. Stew and go? Stew and go.

351
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:10,420
Stew and leave. All right. All right. All right. Right. I'm taking the stew and I'm fucking running.

352
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:51,430
Go. Hurry up. Oops. How can I tell how much time I have left? Oh my God. Do I just, who cares? Just

353
01:14:51,430 --> 01:15:03,859
leave? I think I just have to leave. Do I even buy anything? What is it? I don't know what to do.

354
01:15:03,859 --> 01:15:32,140
What's happening? I don't know what's happening. Let's go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

355
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:48,300
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh my God. What should I do? Should I use the item?

356
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,500
Holy shit. What the fuck just happened? What just happened? What did I just do?

357
01:15:53,140 --> 01:16:30,439
Oh my God. What the fuck is happening? What is this thing? Ace of diamonds?

358
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:46,869
I have 70 coins. I should have done greedier. Damn. Greedier would have been simple.

359
01:16:49,109 --> 01:17:13,210
Oh, I already got it. Did I do something wrong? Broke it. Is that bad? It goes, does it go back to

360
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:25,319
zero? All right. Nice. That was a good first run. You've already unlocked everything. Well, I haven't

361
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:38,569
unlocked everything. Somebody else did. And I just put the save file onto my computer. All right.

362
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:47,270
Let's do a real one. Why do I have a million of these? Oh. All right. You guys are going to have

363
01:17:47,270 --> 01:18:22,359
to guide me to some cool, crazy new content. So one of the big problems I have with Isaac. Have

364
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:33,140
you guys ever jumped on a trampoline before? You ever get off of a trampoline and then jump normally

365
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:44,789
on the ground and it feels crazy. It almost feels like gravity is times 10. When I finish an Isaac

366
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:53,939
run and I start over, it's that same feeling of, Oh, I feel like I have just dumbbells attached to

367
01:18:53,939 --> 01:19:15,850
me. We just go, what is that? Is this gold? Money? I've never seen it. Gold rocks. It's gold. Yep.

368
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:30,630
Gold. Not bad. Playing as Kane. Unfortunately, I have no bombs. Probably the worst character in

369
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:47,350
the game. As you get a hit on the first floor in Isaac, how many hours do you have in this game?

370
01:19:47,989 --> 01:20:14,810
Over a thousand. Try Tainted Kane. Kane has PhD in repentance. He does? Wait, he does have better

371
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:33,430
pills, doesn't he? I was wasting $5. Tainted Lost is really fun. Well, I don't need it right now.

372
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:58,699
I do want to go over here. Secret room may be right here. Yep. Very happy about that. What

373
01:20:58,699 --> 01:21:05,449
does Tainted Lost do? When was the last time you played this game? It was actually not that far

374
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:13,699
away. It was fairly recent. I want to say five, four months ago, four or five months ago.

375
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:26,539
And I didn't play for very long though. I come back to this game very frequently, play it for

376
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:31,899
a few days, play it for a week or two, and then it goes back on the shelf. Another couple of years

377
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:38,600
go by. I was back out. Maybe another six months goes by. I was back out. Just always there.

378
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:58,710
Oh, that's good. Have you ever 100% legit? No, no way. The furthest I ever got was

379
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:06,100
Delirium? I don't think I even beat Delirium. No, I beat Delirium. I think I beat Delirium a couple

380
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:31,590
times. Whatever expansion that was, that was the end. I want to go, no, let's just go. It was like

381
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:41,159
10 years ago. Delirium wasn't 10 years ago. Delirium was after birth, right? Or anti-birth?

382
01:22:42,279 --> 01:22:49,340
Anti-birth was the mod that Repentance is based off of, right? I streamed that. I streamed that.

383
01:22:50,140 --> 01:23:08,250
Forget about this. Yeah, you, all right. I remember you need to have spirit hearts,

384
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:30,119
bombs, right? I forget, I forget what you actually need. Double vision. One key, two bombs? No,

385
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:42,090
it's key, two bombs, two hearts. All right. My mom thinks you give cool tips and tricks. I don't have

386
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:47,859
the heart to tell her what you really do. Why are you making this sound so sinister?

387
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:53,739
I mean, we just like hang out and like crack jokes and play games.

388
01:23:55,289 --> 01:24:09,449
It's not, I don't think it's that sinister. All right, let's go. I'm just going to do it.

389
01:24:09,449 --> 01:24:15,739
Wait, what does the double vision actually do? I didn't read it. 50% chance of adding an extra

390
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:22,119
blind item in treasure rooms. So I can take two. That's pretty awesome. What about the super secret

391
01:24:22,119 --> 01:24:27,770
room? I always skip the super secret room because I never know like reliably where it is, but it

392
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:33,189
has to be connected to a singular room. So therefore it could be the one all the way at the bottom.

393
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:40,979
It could be the boss room. It could be the big room. Wait, why is the big room? What's going on here?

394
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:51,699
Oh, cause I took the pill. Right, right, right, right. Wow. Well, okay.

395
01:25:02,619 --> 01:25:18,500
What does the bone heart do? I'm filling it. I just filled it up. Oh, it's three hits. That's

396
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:34,420
really cool. So without a cheat sheet and without the mods to tell you, do you think this game is

397
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:48,789
more in need of you having a wiki open than Elden Ring? I think, I think actually, yes,

398
01:25:48,789 --> 01:26:03,380
I think so. All right. So, uh, I need two bombs here, right? Or I need two soul hearts.

399
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:31,619
Okay. Which one of this is, oh my God, stay on the screen, dude, dude, get over here. Oh my God. And

400
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:46,600
I'm not even doing my own Isaac rule. So my Isaac rule is look, spend at least 60% of the time

401
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:53,270
playing the game, looking at where, at just you at Isaac only. If you look at Isaac only,

402
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:59,289
this goes for other bullet hell kind of games too. Don't look at the fucking thing shooting at you.

403
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:08,359
Look at the area in a circle around Isaac and just move out of the way. Done. Nice ego.

404
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:32,819
So I get to take both of these, which is one, uh, probably this. Yeah, this one's cool.

405
01:27:33,619 --> 01:27:42,579
This one's more snappy. This one is better. Ah, spectacle tears are better.

406
01:27:49,819 --> 01:27:52,539
Isn't there something weird with the bucket? Isn't there something weird?

407
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:56,380
Something strange with a bucket, right? I have to like go in one or something

408
01:27:57,420 --> 01:28:01,020
or I need to, I need to blow one up. Something strange. I forget what it was.

409
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:41,619
It's a mirror. Oh, you throw up in a bucket. Oh yeah. You puke in the bucket. Secret room.

410
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:53,239
Um, right here. Watch this. So many people just went like, no, no, no. And I was right.

411
01:29:03,909 --> 01:29:15,300
Yikes. That hurt. I don't want to lose the spirit heart. Otherwise the run is over.

412
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:27,380
The secret roomkeepers. Oh, that's right. This is not greed mode.

413
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:49,909
That's a volume. Should I turn it up a little or is it a, is it a good, is it a good volume

414
01:29:49,909 --> 01:30:02,970
for like snoozing? What do you think? Good. I already answered that question by saying fuck you.

415
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:09,590
Oh, man. You're supposed to be snoozing. It's supposed to be like chill string.

416
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:33,460
Doesn't this mean something? This means something, doesn't it? That means something.

417
01:30:35,819 --> 01:31:07,859
Bomb. Nice shop. Why is this shop so bad if this 999 coins donated? It's better than nothing.

418
01:31:07,859 --> 01:32:04,329
Two of hearts. I lost my spirit heart. What? What? That kinda sucks. That kinda sucks.

419
01:32:04,329 --> 01:32:24,069
Okay. I have a spirit heart. Did someone say, how do you have every unlock? Um, I just got the save.

420
01:32:24,069 --> 01:32:31,000
That's just a save file that unlocks everything. I normally wouldn't have done that. But like I

421
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,920
said, in the beginning of the stream, if you weren't here, I've downloaded this game like

422
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:40,500
six times across like four generations of consoles and computers. So I just don't have,

423
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:50,170
I don't know where my real save file is. And it wasn't on the switch though. Oh, well hold down

424
01:32:50,170 --> 01:33:00,619
R like right, like right bumper. What does it do? Hey, what'd you, what'd you do?

425
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:31,939
I was gonna, I thought I made it all the way out. Those things suck. Uh, tapeworm is,

426
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:52,060
eh, it's just range. Oh, this fire. Wait, there's something with the fire, right? Now what? Now go

427
01:33:52,060 --> 01:34:00,409
in? Go in where? Find the mirror now. You just ruined the run. I did. I need to go find the

428
01:34:00,409 --> 01:34:16,659
mirror. There it is. Okay. All right. What? I don't, I think I've only done this once ever.

429
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:38,739
What do I do? Don't get hit. But where do I go? Oh Jesus. These things suck. I'm dead. I lost.

430
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:49,100
I lose? Why did you tell me to do that? I've never done that before. What? What is it? Robo baby?

431
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:59,989
You walked in it. Oh, this thing is awesome. All right. I care more about this one anyways.

432
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:10,340
I can just be a coward. This is perfect. You did that on your own accord. Yeah, but I, I don't know.

433
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:18,329
I didn't know it was the equivalent of people telling me to hold R. I thought it was like an

434
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:31,899
item. By the way, I'm playing the game with the other character. I'm just trying to avoid getting

435
01:35:31,899 --> 01:36:02,359
hit. Bro, what are you doing? I'm hiding and playing the game with the robot. I just love when that

436
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:17,670
happens. Already a better run. Yup. Already a better run. And watch this. I'm not going to

437
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:29,899
use this because I need two to get down to that place. I will always have two. I was going to

438
01:36:29,899 --> 01:37:36,020
play good. Why are you a Reddit avatar? Kind of weird map. Here's up. You don't need soul hearts.

439
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:40,460
You just need to survive two hearts worth of damage. Did they change that? Was that different?

440
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:54,840
I feel like it was two soul hearts before. It was an anti-birth. Oh, okay. It was a change from

441
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:28,229
repentance. Whoa, they're in the ground. Bro, what are you doing? Is it meat in here? What is this?

442
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:52,539
I feel like I can blow that up. Yeah. I think I'll roll the dice here. It's pretty good for

443
01:38:52,539 --> 01:39:02,949
my coward gameplay. It's a nice chill stream. I like it. Thanks for streaming. Thanks for hanging

444
01:39:02,949 --> 01:39:26,359
up. Coward strat's not going to work against the mother. Hold on. I think it's going to work

445
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:42,810
pretty well. Really? I'm standing in the corner and I still got hit by that. That was like the

446
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:48,420
DVD menu that always hits the edges and never gets in the corner. And it went in the corner first

447
01:39:48,420 --> 01:41:01,300
try. Let's just go from all sides. Hmm. Droid rage. There's two or just one. Go kill it. That's

448
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:11,340
not worth it. Too spooky is great for cowards. But I have, I'm going to literally one heart. No,

449
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:17,960
I can't take that. I take too many hits already. Wait, I can open that for free.

450
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:52,359
Let's see what's in here. Donate. That's cheating though. Just that I want to make sure everyone's

451
01:41:52,359 --> 01:42:02,180
aware. My power might go up. It's very windy here in Vegas. Lights just flickered. So just be aware.

452
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:06,260
If it does, it was cool. It was really cool hanging out with you for a couple hours,

453
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:16,199
but that I did. The lights just flickered. So we'll see. If that's the case, a fantastic rest

454
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:23,909
of your night. Take care of yourselves. I'll see you again soon. But let's just operate on the

455
01:42:23,909 --> 01:42:42,600
fact that it's not going to. All right, let's go. This very high wind gust in Vegas right now.

456
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:48,010
Yeah, sometimes it can get really wild. The big difference between this was actually kind of an

457
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:54,180
eye-opening experience for me because I lived in obviously Massachusetts, right? And Massachusetts,

458
01:42:54,180 --> 01:43:03,270
it was snow, snow and rain. I had never really experienced high winds my whole life until moving

459
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:13,590
out here. And sometimes, I mean, sometimes you'll be sitting there out. We'll just be hanging out

460
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:25,029
and you hear. And it's as if there is a monster outside trying to knock down everything. It's,

461
01:43:25,029 --> 01:43:29,029
it seriously feels like there's somebody like outside trying to like, like a gigantic monster

462
01:43:29,029 --> 01:43:36,470
trying to like attack. It's fucking terrifying sometimes. Especially when you get those like

463
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:45,220
50 mile per hour gusts that the room kind of shakes the windows. You'll hear it. It's like

464
01:43:46,819 --> 01:43:54,760
with this huge, scary gust behind it. And that's this is new. I've never experienced that before.

465
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:08,739
I remember there was a windstorm so bad that you could lean into it and not fall over. Whoa,

466
01:44:08,739 --> 01:44:22,869
what's this thing? Spawn six random book of virtues wisps. I just take them. I don't know

467
01:44:22,869 --> 01:44:42,579
what this does. Just use it. Use it when somebody did a troll face. What love crafty in hell do you

468
01:44:42,579 --> 01:44:51,770
live in? Oh, Viva Las Vegas. I don't know what this does, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it for

469
01:44:51,770 --> 01:45:14,550
like an hour. I'm not doing that shit again. This is a rock. Vegas is a modern above ground hell.

470
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:25,560
Maybe I'm just like a contrarian or something, but I like it out here a lot. Talked about it

471
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,470
the other day. I really, I like it out here. Anytime you ever hear somebody talk about Vegas,

472
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:36,789
it's like, Oh, what a fucking P what a dumb place is a piece of shit. And I'm just like, I like it

473
01:45:36,789 --> 01:45:48,649
here. I like enjoy it here. I think when people think of Vegas, they just think of slot machines

474
01:45:48,649 --> 01:46:01,140
and drugs and fighting. So I'm not supposed to be screaming. It's late, but it's not really just that

475
01:46:01,779 --> 01:46:22,069
it's 11 AM. What do you mean? It's so late for the North American audience late night.

476
01:46:22,949 --> 01:46:29,109
Ooh, well, I don't want to do that because I don't want to touch the donation machine.

477
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:45,579
This is not bad so far. I could really use some better tears though. These tears are kind of

478
01:46:46,470 --> 01:47:11,850
plain and boring. Oh wow. How do I tell my dog? He's a dog. Your dog does not understand English.

479
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:19,289
He understands the phonetic way that you pronounce his name and he hears that and he

480
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:24,789
locks that into memory. He knows like probably four words. Your dog knows probably 10 words total.

481
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:29,720
So if you tell your dog like your thesis statement or like a paper or something,

482
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,640
if he's going to be, he's going to hear if someone you talk to your dog, this is what he hears.

483
01:47:34,279 --> 01:47:38,920
Mm hmm. Food. Good boy.

484
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:55,670
Your dog can process the language that you're saying by associating it with things.

485
01:47:56,390 --> 01:48:05,579
They can, well, how many words can a dog know? It's like 20, right? Like 15. Dogs can like

486
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:08,939
understand like up to like 10 to 20 words or something, right? Like it's like, it's a little

487
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:27,960
low. It's 20. It's like 200. It's 400. It's 150. 60 to 180. 60. Yeah. Yeah. So they're,

488
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:36,020
and the thing is, here's the great thing about a dog. Dogs are so unbelievable because they so

489
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:44,039
badly want to understand. You know what I mean? They so badly want to understand what you are

490
01:48:44,039 --> 01:48:55,960
trying to tell them. 180. Yeah. So basically 10. Yeah. But I was, I mean, I was very wrong,

491
01:48:55,960 --> 01:49:01,579
but I was making a very clear point. If you try to tell your dog that they're a dog,

492
01:49:01,579 --> 01:49:06,789
they're going to just hear the words that they understand, which is probably like treat.

493
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:17,720
Like, oh God, the light's flickered again. Oh, going down with the ship, boys and girls.

494
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:38,409
I'm going to keep this. You know, you got to think of a really funny cutoff word.

495
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:50,500
Cool. That was a big one. That was, I don't know if you heard that probably not over the game,

496
01:49:50,500 --> 01:50:18,310
but that was, that one was chunky. That still has spikes on it. Worth it. You're going to be

497
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:35,319
in the wizard of Oz soon. Uh, reusable fortune. Question authority. What does that do? Is that

498
01:50:35,319 --> 01:50:56,439
just the fortune telling machine? It's only 27 miles per hour. You'll be fine. Well, the powers

499
01:50:56,439 --> 01:51:09,239
to well, gusts probably could be potentially more than that. Oh my God. I want that. That's, um,

500
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:19,619
that is amazing. Uh, should I just take all the money? I don't care. Give it, give me all the

501
01:51:19,619 --> 01:51:45,369
money. Cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats, cheats. What does this thing do again?

502
01:51:45,369 --> 01:52:12,550
I don't know. Friends from beyond. Just gives you from friends. Is it friends for the floor?

503
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:24,170
Friends for the room. I imagine it's probably just for the room. I don't need this anymore.

504
01:52:24,810 --> 01:52:39,750
As long as they stay alive. Okay. Cool. Dude, get out, get away from me. I thought it was

505
01:52:39,750 --> 01:53:03,270
going to bounce off the wall. Actually, probably the best three stats to get upgraded. Oh, I need

506
01:53:03,270 --> 01:53:34,250
another bomb. That's the fire and then go in the mirror. I, that's how I died last time. I better

507
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:46,329
get this. I have to try as hard as I can. Where is the mirror? Is there a way I can make sure I

508
01:53:46,329 --> 01:54:07,100
don't die or just play very well? Just be good and don't get hit. I already got, I mean, it's

509
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:30,279
already over. What did I do this? I'm leaving. You have light floating attack. Why? It seems kind of

510
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:56,220
good. What? Oh, did I just lose a heart by doing this in here? I did. I was on autopilot. I just

511
01:54:56,220 --> 01:55:15,500
lost a heart. I think I have three bombs now. All right. Don't mess around. Where's my buddy?

512
01:55:16,699 --> 01:55:49,930
Get up here and do stuff. Nice. Okay. Give me the item. Use the soul. Use the soul. Use the soul.

513
01:55:52,340 --> 01:56:10,279
Oh, cool. I keep going. Should I fight the boss? I have a question. If I use this right now, will

514
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:28,979
it give me another hit? That's too risky. I'm going to go for it. Whatever. What's the worst

515
01:56:28,979 --> 01:56:57,640
that happens? I lose. I think I'll be all right. Whoa. Oh, it's the same boss. That's fine. Yeah,

516
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:09,880
we're good. Here's up exactly what I wanted. All right. So now do I just go back through the

517
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:44,899
mirror? Cool. Good. That's not so bad. Yeah, that's all I really want to do anyways. Tinted rock.

518
01:57:46,939 --> 01:58:25,300
Where is he? Yep. You're right. God damn it. Cheater. No, I did. I cheated to get that money.

519
01:58:26,439 --> 01:58:41,159
You're absolutely right. Look at this speed. Secret room. There's a lot of places where it

520
01:58:41,159 --> 01:58:51,909
could be. I don't really know which one. Hey, is it true that you bought a toilet plunger? 15 pounds

521
01:58:51,909 --> 01:58:56,380
of brown beef and a... No, I can already tell you that's not true because of the second one.

522
01:59:24,279 --> 01:59:52,359
Okay. Is that really worth two bombs? I don't think so. He's vegan. I'm not vegan. I'm not vegan.

523
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:08,020
He hates animals then. Come on. Oh, I ate red meat. Oh, you must be a fucking monster.

524
02:00:09,619 --> 02:00:32,069
No, I... But I'm not vegan. Wow. What are you? Dumb? No, but I... Come on, man. Oh, this little guy

525
02:00:32,069 --> 02:00:43,430
with a little rock. I will tell you that I have really tried to, I don't know, be a little more

526
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:55,479
aware of... Just like what I'm eating. Trying to cut back on... Trying to be better about what I'm

527
02:00:55,479 --> 02:01:09,130
eating. Trying to eat more fish, right? Less meat overall. Just because, you know, I'm getting older.

528
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:26,970
Why don't I just do that? Re-stock. Never-ending stores. Oh my god. This is ridiculous. Okay.

529
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:40,699
So let's do this. Let's do this. Oh, it's not a full heart. Well, now it is. And now it is again.

530
02:01:40,699 --> 02:02:22,069
That is actual bullshit. Why did I even buy that? Rip deals? You've wasted... What do you mean rip

531
02:02:22,069 --> 02:02:32,229
deals? I got... Dude, I've got an end-game Zelda heart container over there. I'm fine. I could get

532
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:42,470
hit a hundred times and be alive. I'm good. No, this is not even end-game Zelda. I don't think I

533
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:52,279
have a... This is 100% completionist Andy Zelda. I think I fought Ganon with like seven hearts.

534
02:02:52,279 --> 02:03:12,020
Stop saying Andy. It's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. Clutch. I've never fought this boss before.

535
02:03:25,689 --> 02:04:05,060
Oh, I get it. This is kind of fucked up. How could I have all these hearts? Jesus. Oh my god. He like

536
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:14,819
glues to you. Okay. Well, that's the first time I've ever seen that guy. I do need more damage.

537
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:36,380
Well, that's amazing to have. I think I still want to keep the hostile fly. That's a full heal.

538
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:51,399
It's incredible. I still want the... Don't... Thought I went in an accidently. Oh, the item room.

539
02:04:51,399 --> 02:05:26,180
My power went out. LMAO. Be careful. God damn windy out there. But yeah, I'm trying to eat a

540
02:05:26,180 --> 02:05:34,760
little bit better. And hey, however you eat, it's up to you. Are you vegetarian? All right.

541
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:54,170
Let's go. Up to you. You eat a bunch of meat. It's up to you. Ooh, angel room. Although I...

542
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:06,859
I do think that just for me personally, trying to cut back on just meat, meat like meat and cheese

543
02:06:07,819 --> 02:06:19,220
is... It's just better. Just better for my slow 40-year-old fucking man metabolism. Man-sized

544
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:33,060
meals. Is there even enough time to do this still? Well, it's probably better at this point.

545
02:06:35,449 --> 02:06:39,289
Re-rolls and restarts the floor. I think I might just do that. Why not?

546
02:06:40,090 --> 02:06:46,470
What a McDonald's Andy. But I don't eat McDonald's every day. Neither should you.

547
02:06:56,039 --> 02:07:49,939
This is the worst item in the game. I mean, whatever. Oh, thanks. Wait, you're 40? What am

548
02:07:49,939 --> 02:08:17,500
I doing here? I don't know. You tell me. This dude is fucking ancient. I think I'm just going to do

549
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:25,979
it. Yeah, let's do it. Free stuff. I got tons of money. Not tons of money. I got tons of hearts.

550
02:08:30,939 --> 02:09:10,250
Jesus. Well, now I do have tons of money. My God. How many pills?

551
02:09:38,899 --> 02:09:44,630
Nah. That's a cool item, but I've obviously got way too much money.

552
02:10:29,739 --> 02:10:48,619
Tammy's head is all right. Well, let's gamble. Candy heart. Pure love. Holy shit. Picking up

553
02:10:48,619 --> 02:11:09,590
red hearts gives permanent stat upgrades. Seems really good. What is... Okay. Oh, that's cool.

554
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:47,560
Let's just do it. Oh, I turned it off. Shit. Oh, I didn't turn it off. It's kind of fun to do.

555
02:11:47,560 --> 02:12:06,970
How do I already have 70 coins again? Break rocks and secret room entrances and damage enemies.

556
02:12:06,970 --> 02:12:13,319
Landing a hit with the axe reduces its charge. Better than the cookbook, but this is probably

557
02:12:13,319 --> 02:12:50,140
better overall. I can't even do it. Oh, I mean, no, I can't even do it. Stop buying pills. Well,

558
02:12:51,020 --> 02:13:03,750
Kane has better pills. I'm trying to get stat increases with that. I'm not trying to get health.

559
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:33,750
Look at Amara. I'm already doing an ungodly amount of damage. Okay. Yeah, let's go. I fucking hate.

560
02:13:33,750 --> 02:14:31,529
I hate this item. Who's shooting the boogers? Oh, it's a random baby, right? Oh my God.

561
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:53,159
That's great. No one's forcing you to use the book. Well, how am I supposed to do the use the

562
02:14:53,159 --> 02:15:08,149
cookbook challenge? Is there everybody voted for a couple hours ago? I don't want to do that.

563
02:15:08,149 --> 02:15:25,300
I already found the secret room. That's a lot of minus twos. Geez. That's an ungodly amount of

564
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:48,939
minus twos. I'm getting my ass kicked. Wait, what's going on? One makes you larger? Why is

565
02:15:48,939 --> 02:16:00,220
it showing me that? Oh, okay. I want to be bigger. I want them to be able to hit me with incredible

566
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:46,260
ease. What does that do? I need to get all three of them. Oh, cool. Okay. I'll do it. Who's this

567
02:16:46,260 --> 02:17:18,280
little guy I have here? I like it. Wait, what is it? Oh shit. Okay. Sorry, I'm reading mod chat.

568
02:17:18,280 --> 02:18:04,260
Um, hold on. I need to write something. No, no, everything's good. No, I'm not. Wait, why is

569
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:26,600
this still happening? Oh, okay. I already have good pills. What does it do? Wait, should I just

570
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:49,239
get free pills? Does it make them even better? I don't think I need any items. Yeah, I was just

571
02:18:49,239 --> 02:18:52,360
reading something in my chat. We're talking about something. It's really, really cool. Really nice.

572
02:18:52,360 --> 02:19:11,850
It's a really, really cool, really, really nice thing. All right. Okay. And let me pay attention

573
02:19:11,850 --> 02:19:33,659
now. Touch every button. All right. So buy hearts. Uh, I could buy hearts. You're right. As well.

574
02:19:33,659 --> 02:19:55,500
Stock up. I'm going to say it's right. All right. There's the third one. Should I not press it yet?

575
02:19:55,500 --> 02:20:03,860
Maybe I shouldn't. I think I've realistically only done this route three times. Maybe ever.

576
02:20:03,860 --> 02:20:29,530
What's this? Press it and get in the mine cart. Where am I going? Why do they lose stats? Where's

577
02:20:29,530 --> 02:21:15,270
all my stuff? What is this? Why is there nothing in here? Okay. No, didn't I? Have I never done

578
02:21:15,270 --> 02:21:29,399
this? Is this? When did they add this? I piece too. That's fantastic. Um, how do I get out of here?

579
02:21:37,770 --> 02:22:09,079
Oh God. Thank God. I have so much help. You. What do I do with that? I think I just figured that out.

580
02:22:09,079 --> 02:22:44,649
Hurry up. I did it. Okay. Cool. Now what's the price of electricity? All right. That was pretty

581
02:22:44,649 --> 02:22:50,280
cool. So what's the, what's the, what's the protocol now? Where do I go? Just keep going.

582
02:22:50,280 --> 02:23:14,299
Just get more health. I have the sun. So that's good. Thankfully this baby is amazing. I could

583
02:23:14,299 --> 02:23:32,569
go buy. Oh, there we go. I could go buy hearts though. There's a lot of damage. That's that.

584
02:23:32,569 --> 02:23:43,239
It's better. That's just way better than the, uh, in the book. Please.

585
02:23:50,870 --> 02:23:59,510
Hmm. The sacrifice room always seemed like just a waste to me. You have to step on it like seven

586
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:23,620
times for it to do anything good, right? Is that better than the laser? I could go in there and

587
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:34,979
get hit a bunch of times and use the sun card. Ooh, that's just amazing. This thing finds to the,

588
02:24:34,979 --> 02:24:42,500
I wish I had this permanently turned on. This thing finds tinted rocks and secret rooms is

589
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:50,629
awesome. I don't have to, I don't even have to look, do the sacrifice room. I don't,

590
02:24:52,299 --> 02:25:03,670
I really don't want to, I want all heal, use it 13 times. Exactly. No, it's not worth it.

591
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:22,569
The sun card is a full heal. Whatever this last boss is of repentance. Do you really think I'm

592
02:25:22,569 --> 02:25:29,750
going to do this with only being able to take like eight hits? No way. Although

593
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:43,219
worth it. Don't do it this run. No, yeah. I, I don't even know what the boss is.

594
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:49,750
Whatever the final boss is with the knife or whatever, or whatever, whatever I get,

595
02:25:50,709 --> 02:26:14,389
I don't know. Is it delirium? Nice. Strength, sun, get out of jail free card. Open all doors in the

596
02:26:14,389 --> 02:26:44,360
current room. Uh, I'm just going to do this. I feel like it's the sun though. Use strength and

597
02:26:44,360 --> 02:27:03,639
just keep. Yeah. Like I'll see it, but I feel like I want the full heal. You want to do the

598
02:27:03,639 --> 02:27:12,819
true final boss. I'd like to see it. I'm going to hold onto it. I'm going to keep the heel. I think

599
02:27:12,819 --> 02:27:28,469
it's way more important. All right. Now we're talking. This is some pretty, this is, this is

600
02:27:28,469 --> 02:27:33,579
damage that can carry. I think the end of the run, maybe if I get one more good damage weapon, maybe

601
02:27:50,889 --> 02:28:08,010
Ooh, awesome. Okay. That's pretty good. Finally locked enemy shots coming from the direct.

602
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:20,299
I think that's it, right? Salvation. It's probably that and just standing in the corner and look

603
02:28:20,299 --> 02:28:25,879
right. It's the shield. It always is. Just go like this and just always make sure you're on the same

604
02:28:25,879 --> 02:28:46,250
plane. Bomb the angel. This is for a key piece, right? Why did I not block it? I was standing

605
02:28:46,250 --> 02:29:06,020
right there. Hey, why is it not blocking it? Is there anything else I can do before I leave

606
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:20,260
changes to pee pee poo poo? I mean, that's fine. People are going to ask what the fuck

607
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:36,969
that even means. Yeah, that's, that's all right. That works. Yeah. Funny. I think I'm just going

608
02:29:36,969 --> 02:29:58,420
to go. Let's get out of here. Tired. I got to get up early. Get some sleep. Mausoleum. What's that?

609
02:29:58,420 --> 02:30:23,930
I've never seen this before. It's five cents. I got it. I got it. Marbles. Oh, that kind of stinks.

610
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:44,120
I mean, I have, I have the fly. I don't think I'm going to keep the things. Still pretty good.

611
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:51,479
Yeah. A little late for that. Geez. Wait, that, I don't know if I want to touch that. That could be

612
02:30:51,479 --> 02:31:01,610
the nine lives thing. That could be guppy. I don't want to touch that. That's going to bring me down

613
02:31:01,610 --> 02:31:08,709
to one heart. I'm not touching that. I don't know what it is. Do it. Do it. Touch it anyway. No,

614
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:17,780
it's going to be Guppy's body. And I'm going to go down to one heart. Okay. I did it. I'm,

615
02:31:17,780 --> 02:31:27,719
it doesn't matter. I don't even want it. So, all right. That was very scary actually again.

616
02:31:27,719 --> 02:32:27,590
But what, why is this thing going? What's going on? Where am I? I don't know what I just did.

617
02:32:27,590 --> 02:32:58,299
What happened? Where am I? It was a golden pill. I thought it was a money pill. I got to make my way

618
02:32:58,299 --> 02:33:29,610
back to that room. I wasn't done. Is that a blade? Shit. I can't pick it up. No, it's going to be,

619
02:33:29,610 --> 02:34:25,959
I can't touch it guys. What was that? Nice. IV bag. More prizes. Nightlight? Scared of the dark.

620
02:34:25,959 --> 02:35:00,520
Oh, oh, it slows them if you look at them, right? This thing's kind of, yeah. You drink coffee every

621
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:16,280
day. Usually. Yes. Usually. It's a big part of my morning routine. What was it? What are you looking

622
02:35:16,280 --> 02:35:47,290
at? That was weird. Sometimes it's damage up. I completely forgot about the active item. Oh,

623
02:35:47,290 --> 02:36:02,979
shut up. Ow. All right. I got to clean it up a little bit. I'm, this is pretty sloppy.

624
02:36:02,979 --> 02:36:30,010
This is pretty sloppy. Hold on. Actually perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Perfect. All right. Give

625
02:36:30,010 --> 02:36:58,459
me hearts out of here. How would you use your trinket? Trinket. Flying. You need flight. Flight

626
02:36:58,459 --> 02:37:22,040
is the, you are, get a trinket from the arcade. Scared the absolute shit out of me. Forgot that's

627
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:40,790
what that did. All right. Where's the flying trinket? You swallowed the, wait, there is not

628
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:51,399
one. You have no trinket. Wait, why did you guys tell me to come back here? Your fly ate it. Shiny

629
02:37:51,399 --> 02:38:02,809
rock? What are you guys talking about? You need the trinket for something else. You ate it. Take

630
02:38:02,809 --> 02:38:13,059
it. You swallowed your old trinket to get a new one. Oh, whatever. We're fine. Oh, you're good.

631
02:38:13,059 --> 02:38:44,069
Thank you. I'm looking for hearts. Don't get hurt. God awful room. No, not spirit hearts. Regular

632
02:38:44,069 --> 02:39:00,870
hearts. Spirit hearts. Whatever. This is cheap. One plus one free forever. Jar of flies. Pretty

633
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:33,690
cool. Coupon. Now you can fly. Ooh. Jumper cables. School bag. Extra active item. And that thing.

634
02:39:33,690 --> 02:39:49,750
Give me a regular heart, dude. Come on. Oops. How do you switch between them? How do you switch

635
02:39:49,750 --> 02:40:16,819
between active items? R2? Oh, okay. Right. I think this is fine. Stop giving me this shit.

636
02:40:16,819 --> 02:40:31,459
Give me something else. Use the coupon in the shop. I already did, didn't I? Yeah, I did.

637
02:40:31,459 --> 02:40:48,629
Isaac's dream. Bat chest. Wait, this is like a red empress. Plus two health up. Ears up. That

638
02:40:48,629 --> 02:41:10,600
glass. All right. I'm just going to use it right now. Isaac. I feel like bat chesting Isaac is

639
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:27,879
that makes me feel a hundred years old. It's not accurate, right? No, it's not at all. Isaac

640
02:41:27,879 --> 02:41:43,129
bat chest. No, that's no way. I actually do not believe you. That would be a shock. All right.

641
02:41:43,129 --> 02:41:48,739
Let me go get the other thing that was over here. I think I got a pretty good build to try to finish

642
02:41:48,739 --> 02:41:57,860
this. I've been on this run for an hour. I do play this game so slowly though, because I'm so

643
02:41:57,860 --> 02:42:18,170
afraid of getting hit and like hitting spikes on the ground. Where was it? Using a pill car to ruin

644
02:42:18,170 --> 02:42:24,969
is a 25% chance to drop a copy. Oh man. That would be amazing if I could, if that actually worked

645
02:42:24,969 --> 02:42:39,850
with this. Well, let's hope so. 25% is really not, that's a place to bomb. It's not? What is that?

646
02:42:39,850 --> 02:43:26,180
That is very clearly an X on the ground. All right. Let's go. This is the siren hatch book.

647
02:43:26,180 --> 02:43:50,700
Now I definitely want to keep this cool. Bomb the skull. We keep going. Is there anything I need to

648
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:59,209
know on this floor? Oh, is that quad shot? No, it's not. What is this? I was going to say that's

649
02:43:59,209 --> 02:44:20,329
game over if it is. I mean, it kind of, it is shoots four shots sometimes. Yeah. Oh, it is cool.

650
02:44:20,329 --> 02:44:34,090
Nice. All right. As long as I play pretty well, I might be able to see the final, final boss.

651
02:44:34,649 --> 02:45:00,889
And then I want to do another greed mode. I love greed mode. Ow. Give me a good card. Hmm. Who

652
02:45:00,889 --> 02:45:29,659
Nintendo? No. 5% is really low, but if you get hit all the time, it's going to be okay. I would love

653
02:45:29,659 --> 02:46:03,030
some more area. I feel like my tears are really small. Range up. Nice. You want to fight the final

654
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:13,420
repentance final boss or the true final boss of the game? Which one is more interesting? What would

655
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:26,229
you say is the more, Oh yeah, that's cool. You should see that the beast. It's too late to do

656
02:46:26,229 --> 02:46:30,649
the beast. You're locked into the repentance boss right now. Oh, that's all right. Whatever.

657
02:46:30,649 --> 02:46:46,620
It's cool. If you have the knife, it's the repentance boss. Okay. Might as well have 7.5

658
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:51,340
luck. Do I have anything that is spawning off of luck or works off of luck? I don't think so.

659
02:46:52,299 --> 02:47:25,670
Jesus. Oh, he popped out of my head. Do I just don't control them anymore? He's awesome. He's

660
02:47:25,670 --> 02:48:01,500
awesome. I should just get hit. You like old book smells. Um, probably. I mean, I, yeah,

661
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:24,389
I would say so. I like the smell of, uh, like a seller, like a basement. There's this really

662
02:48:24,389 --> 02:48:35,719
specific basement smell. It's really, it's, it's great. It's such a nice smell. What is that by

663
02:48:35,719 --> 02:48:49,399
the way, that smell, what is it? No, it's not mold. It's a very specific thing. It's like musty.

664
02:48:50,040 --> 02:49:06,100
No, not asbestos, asbestos, damp concrete. Yeah. I like the smell of wood too. All right. It's time

665
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:14,659
for all of you to judge me. They make these dog toys that are wood, dog, chewy toy things.

666
02:49:16,620 --> 02:49:24,469
And I love the way these things smell. These things are for dogs and they're so, they smell

667
02:49:24,549 --> 02:49:33,530
so good. They have this unbelievable, unbelievably wonderful wood scent on them.

668
02:49:36,629 --> 02:49:42,379
This dude is huffing his dog's toys. You know, I don't, some of you that don't, if you know,

669
02:49:42,379 --> 02:50:00,200
you know, right? If you know, you know, should I make it harder? This is gonna, this is stupid,

670
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:15,700
but I get more damage, right? I could also do this and just spam it at the boss. Just hold onto coins

671
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:36,459
and then just go, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, bub, the red thing. I need more damage.

672
02:50:36,459 --> 02:50:55,850
Oh, that's how you do it. This range is ridiculous. Why is this pill so huge?

673
02:50:55,850 --> 02:51:24,760
What just happened? This is the fastest I can go. I'm capped out for speed. Okay. Cool. You've got

674
02:51:24,760 --> 02:52:03,860
max stats. Feels good. What the hell is that thing? I can pick that up yet. Dog toys. Otto has so many

675
02:52:03,860 --> 02:52:10,459
dog toys and I can't get rid of them because he likes all of them. Sometimes he'll just go in.

676
02:52:10,459 --> 02:52:17,370
He's got a little toy, little toy chest thingy and he'll just pick out a different one every few

677
02:52:17,370 --> 02:52:25,799
days. And sometimes one, a toy will be unused for months and months and months. And then randomly

678
02:52:25,799 --> 02:52:35,700
one day you'll see him go over there and he'll pull out Mr. Flamingo. And he's like, Oh, Mr.

679
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:40,340
Flamingo today. And he's throwing it around and he's having a bunch of fun with it. He has not

680
02:52:40,340 --> 02:52:56,920
played with this for weeks. What is this clip? This clip looks like old. Wait, I did this already?

681
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:28,329
Hold on. Turn this down for a second. You've already seen me do this. Hold on. I'm not going

682
02:53:29,209 --> 02:53:48,010
to chew on this on stream, right? This is what I'm talking about. It's this weird tree trunk

683
02:53:49,940 --> 02:53:58,459
and I'm not going to smell it because it smells like my dog's mouth. But when this is out of the

684
02:53:58,459 --> 02:54:08,600
package, brand new, it smells fantastic. He's right. Right out of the package. It smells like

685
02:54:08,600 --> 02:54:13,879
this awesome wood smell. This has been in my dog's mouth. Here it is. I'm not going to put it in my

686
02:54:13,879 --> 02:54:25,739
mouth. Somebody said, dude, why is David Spade on your stream? This is when I was growing the

687
02:54:25,739 --> 02:54:36,549
mustache out for the baseball stream. Or was it after the baseball stream? This is two years ago.

688
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:46,729
Wait, what? Why did I have a fucking mustache two years ago? What was this for? Why did I do this?

689
02:54:46,729 --> 02:54:52,649
What was the point of this? Was I doing a bit or something? I must have thought it was funny.

690
02:54:52,899 --> 02:55:10,680
I had to have thought it was funny. Why did I do this? You did this after shaving one night

691
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:17,559
and thought it was funny, as Holly says. I just thought it was funny to do this. I guess so.

692
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:32,309
All right. Well, I thought this was like a few months ago. Anyways, yeah, true. It's good.

693
02:55:32,309 --> 02:55:41,350
I'm not sitting there huffing dog bones, but it's got this great cedar smell. I think they put it

694
02:55:41,350 --> 02:55:51,500
on there specifically. You look 45. Yeah. I ain't getting any younger, man. I'm, you know,

695
02:55:51,500 --> 02:56:07,940
whatever. But people age. You get older. The way it is. All right. So if I walk through this door

696
02:56:07,940 --> 02:56:19,079
is a time to fight this super boss. That's really cool, dude. Smell whatever you want. I don't care.

697
02:56:19,079 --> 02:56:54,139
Play the game. Oh, this is different. What did I get hit by? That was almost perfect. Okay. What?

698
02:56:54,139 --> 02:57:15,659
It's the left, right? I'm doing a lot of damage. So much more damage. All right. And then to the

699
02:57:15,659 --> 02:57:39,930
left. Let's go. Mom's heart. Okay. I'm used to this. Shit. My God. They're everywhere.

700
02:57:40,969 --> 02:58:23,100
What is hitting me? Did I win? Oh, room dumb ass. Hey, it's don't you think it's too late

701
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:51,819
for insult? It's too late for insult. Corpse one zombie, which coin friend should I give it to?

702
02:58:52,459 --> 02:59:01,739
He'll never read this. It just did. None of them. First one only. I don't know what the other one

703
02:59:01,739 --> 02:59:21,110
does in the end. Okay. It gives rotten hearts. That doesn't fill up the regular hearts though,

704
02:59:21,110 --> 02:59:44,840
does it? Also, I need to activate the flies. Let's just do that in the next room. Fuck. I had it.

705
02:59:52,629 --> 03:00:19,219
Should have wharfed it. Oh my God. So much money. Really? What am I going to do with all this?

706
03:00:19,219 --> 03:01:33,510
Did I just get that? Did I have that floating fly before? Rot hearts take double damage. That's

707
03:01:33,510 --> 03:01:55,020
fine. Better than nothing. If I had resident sleeper to a positive message, would you read it?

708
03:01:55,020 --> 03:02:02,700
Resident sleeper is not necessarily a negative emote. The context of resident sleeper. For

709
03:02:02,700 --> 03:02:09,590
instance, you could say, I'm getting really sleepy right now, but this is like a really chilled

710
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:19,110
night. Resident sleeper. Like, oh, I've got so many exams I have to study for a resident sleeper.

711
03:02:19,110 --> 03:02:28,620
Like it's, you know, I'm tired. So now if you said this stream sucks, resident sleeper,

712
03:02:28,620 --> 03:02:51,209
I'd ban you. That's the context. Have you, I don't think you've ever banned anyone ever.

713
03:02:52,809 --> 03:03:04,489
Um, I don't, I don't know. Maybe a long, maybe a long time ago. I mean, it's a lot of mods.

714
03:03:05,610 --> 03:03:16,360
The mods, I'll take care of it. Mods act 100% on my behalf. So you know what they're doing.

715
03:03:20,940 --> 03:03:28,870
Electric key. You know, you did, you banned someone for posting a video that had a jumpscare

716
03:03:28,870 --> 03:03:38,739
noise in one of the VR streams. You banned them for three days. I remember it vividly.

717
03:03:38,739 --> 03:03:48,280
Well, all right. So it's been, it's been at least one. Hey, just, just relax and you won't get

718
03:03:48,280 --> 03:04:12,489
fucking banned. It's that simple. Ooh, I'm small. Glass eye. All right. The tears are huge now.

719
03:04:26,219 --> 03:04:34,360
All right. We got damage. I just gotta get, keep my health up. What is going on?

720
03:04:35,319 --> 03:05:22,100
Come on, dude. It's turning into a real annoyance. Roll. All right. Well, I might as well just go

721
03:05:22,100 --> 03:05:29,110
spend the money, right? Cause this is, is this it? One more after this. This is getting close.

722
03:05:29,110 --> 03:06:06,459
Probably nothing worth buying. Light is overpowered. Another run after this. Yeah.

723
03:06:06,459 --> 03:06:13,930
I'll do another greed run after this. Whatever happens here. That's cool, but not a big deal.

724
03:06:13,930 --> 03:06:27,000
What the, oh my God. I didn't know they get, I thought they shot the beams.

725
03:06:27,639 --> 03:07:07,319
I gotta find the secret rooms. Yeah. Yes. I can't pick that up. Power pill is cool, but no.

726
03:07:07,319 --> 03:07:32,549
On the skulls. Yeah. Might as well. Let's go. Turns out it was worth it. Oh, lovers again.

727
03:07:32,549 --> 03:08:00,680
I wish I could pick that up. Take some damage and come back. Um, wasn't I, I already was hurt.

728
03:08:00,680 --> 03:08:09,159
I couldn't pick it up. You'll get stat buffs. Wait, when I pick up red hearts, that's right.

729
03:08:09,159 --> 03:08:31,079
Yeah, you're right. Let me just go get hurt. Oh, I can't get hurt by the spikes.

730
03:08:31,079 --> 03:08:51,860
Somebody hurt me. I'll just do it myself. I've got 40 bombs. Um, it's all right. Nice. All right.

731
03:08:51,860 --> 03:09:10,870
Let's go. All right. I got old jar. Everything good. All right. Let's do it. This is almost

732
03:09:10,870 --> 03:09:23,190
instant kill. Good because I don't, I am taking a lot of damage. Okay. Good. Good thing. I do a ton

733
03:09:23,190 --> 03:09:40,149
of damage. Are there any more hearts? I don't think so. I could stand across the whole game

734
03:09:40,149 --> 03:10:14,360
at this point. All right, let's do it. Uh, wish me luck. Oops. I'll just bring it up.

735
03:10:14,360 --> 03:10:23,739
I'll come back in here. Use it right now. Oh, it's time to make the devil mad.

736
03:10:23,739 --> 03:11:09,770
No, it doesn't. It just makes the devil mad. You're cranky. Am I? I think so. I'm not,

737
03:11:09,770 --> 03:11:53,350
how am I cranky? I'm not even, I, let's go. Uh, oh, what do these do? What do these do?

738
03:11:53,350 --> 03:12:03,079
He's actually saying you're in a really good mood. What is this thing? Open shops for free.

739
03:12:03,079 --> 03:12:28,120
Really? These things, my friend though? Weird. I'm just so fast. When you get to like 2.0 speed in

740
03:12:28,120 --> 03:12:33,530
Isaac, it's actually kind of a detriment. You move so quickly and you run into shit all the time.

741
03:12:46,899 --> 03:13:08,680
Your son card? No, I'll get it. I will not lose it. Let's play everything first. Where are my

742
03:13:08,680 --> 03:13:29,670
glasses? Where are my glasses? You swallowed it. Why is that happening? Why is that happening?

743
03:13:29,670 --> 03:13:46,409
Where are my glasses? The marbles. Oh shit. That's, that's actually pretty unfortunate.

744
03:13:46,409 --> 03:14:11,940
You keep the effect. Oh, there's so much. Okay. Let me go get my thingy. Where's my thingy?

745
03:14:11,940 --> 03:14:17,530
Get pink eye instead. Pink eye is probably better than this. Yeah. Poison damage would be.

746
03:14:17,530 --> 03:14:34,889
Yeah, for sure. I would nine, almost 9.0 luck. Are you kidding me? Where's the card?

747
03:14:34,889 --> 03:14:50,950
Geez, that scared me. Get the fuck out of here. Wish I could sell some of these keys for hearts.

748
03:14:50,950 --> 03:15:21,959
Something's wrong. Bombs are key. Who cares? Even more range. So much range. Can you please

749
03:15:21,959 --> 03:15:25,639
play my favorite game? Oh, this is Ball Fondler. I'm reading Ball Fondler's comment and I didn't

750
03:15:25,639 --> 03:15:33,909
think it was Ball Fondler. I just started reading a message and it just happened to be Ball Fondler.

751
03:15:33,909 --> 03:15:38,950
Hi Ball Fondler. How are you? How are you doing? Well, and let me, let me just answer Ball Fondler

752
03:15:38,950 --> 03:15:45,590
directly. Um, no Ball Fondler. I'm not going, I, I'm not going to buy all the flying carpets you

753
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:58,020
made on the auction house. I don't play that game. Stop asking me to do that. I can't, whatever.

754
03:15:58,020 --> 03:16:08,010
Let's go. Hey man, can you please play my favorite game? I'm like, Oh, I'm going to read. What's this

755
03:16:08,010 --> 03:16:28,620
person have to say? He's just everywhere. He's everywhere. Come on, do it. Skyrim is, I don't

756
03:16:28,620 --> 03:16:36,329
know. Is it weird that I really just kind of like don't want to play Skyrim? I already ruined

757
03:16:36,329 --> 03:16:44,090
everything for myself playing it. I put on a bunch of stupid dog shit mods and I've ruined the whole

758
03:16:44,090 --> 03:17:25,540
game. I can never play it normally. All right. Am I ready? Skyrim fucking sucks without mods, dude.

759
03:17:25,540 --> 03:18:35,739
Are we good? I'm going to go for it. Hope I don't lose. Mother. Oh my God. Holy shit. Whoa. Jesus.

760
03:18:35,819 --> 03:19:59,159
Oh my God. Oh, can't even see. Did I do it? Did it? Nice. That was crazy. I mean, 11.7 damage.

761
03:20:00,149 --> 03:20:04,819
I have a lot. I, that took, good thing I had the sun card. Otherwise I was dead.

762
03:20:04,819 --> 03:20:11,059
Sun carry. Yeah. I don't think I've ever seen this cut scene.

763
03:20:47,940 --> 03:20:49,700
I'll show you a monster.

764
03:20:58,010 --> 03:21:45,129
I can't even look at you. Isaac has a voice song.

765
03:22:16,219 --> 03:22:21,129
Did they give Isaac a voice in repentance? I don't remember in the other ones. I'm talking

766
03:22:21,850 --> 03:22:46,889
for some of the final cut scenes. Yeah. Oh, what did that say? I didn't see it. I liked over chat.

767
03:22:46,889 --> 03:23:06,409
That's really cool. All right. I'll try. Greedier might as well. Who's good for a Greedier. So I do

768
03:23:06,409 --> 03:23:21,700
Greedier with one of the characters. Try the beast to a beast and trending. Who's a good character

769
03:23:21,700 --> 03:23:41,559
to play with? I love Samson. Wait, painted Samson. This is good. It's fun. That's right.

770
03:23:41,559 --> 03:24:02,549
Cause it looks like this. So is it worth the same as regular Samson? If you get hurt or do you have

771
03:24:02,549 --> 03:24:16,600
to, how does it work with this one? Hey, it does not work that way. Wrong difficulty notes. It's

772
03:24:16,600 --> 03:24:32,819
not hard. Yeah. It's hard. You're Greedier. You were supposed to play Greedier. Yeah. Then somebody

773
03:24:32,819 --> 03:24:38,739
said, kill the beast. And I was like, you know what? Maybe I'll try that. I'm going to give it

774
03:24:38,739 --> 03:24:52,969
like one solid attempt and then I'm going to play the other one. He's just more fun. So how does

775
03:24:52,969 --> 03:25:11,959
this work? I'm turning red, but I'm not in my damage isn't going up. You'll see like, look,

776
03:25:11,959 --> 03:25:35,420
I'm about to explode. Okay. So that you turn into that and it lasts for a few seconds,

777
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:44,709
the more you kill, the longer it lasts. It doesn't have a charge bar. He doesn't have charge bars on

778
03:25:44,709 --> 03:26:04,379
Omega Lul. If they're distracting. So it's probably better just to do melee then, right? And not throw

779
03:26:04,379 --> 03:26:32,420
it. There really are zero coins in here now. That's so funny. Um, give me one second. I want

780
03:26:32,420 --> 03:26:47,059
to get some water. Actually, you know, I might make a tea. Oh, Northern lion, Northern lion. What

781
03:26:47,139 --> 03:39:57,510
about it? Northern lion's awesome. I'll be right back. I'm going to get a tea. Okay. Hello. Hey,

782
03:39:57,510 --> 03:40:14,020
I need to make my tea. It takes about four minutes to steep. That scared me. I'm trying to do,

783
03:40:14,020 --> 03:40:17,909
I told you, like when I come back from breaks now, especially when it's this late,

784
03:40:17,909 --> 03:40:42,120
I try to do a little like, I'll be like, I only got the clown makeup on here. What's the music

785
03:40:42,120 --> 03:40:54,469
playing? It's just the Isaac music. Do I put anything in my tea? Not usually. And it's not

786
03:40:54,469 --> 03:41:04,200
because of flavor. It's more so laziness, but there's a peach tea and put the bags in it's

787
03:41:04,200 --> 03:41:10,489
steeps. And then I just drink it, take the bags out, drink it. Like getting the honey, getting

788
03:41:10,489 --> 03:41:23,989
sugar, get it, taking it out, squeezing it in, stirring it up. I'd rather just drink it. Uh,

789
03:41:23,989 --> 03:41:30,569
but no, I like putting that stuff in my tea. I've been pretty basic about it though. Same with

790
03:41:30,569 --> 03:41:39,079
coffee too. I've been drinking a lot of black coffee, a lot of just regular ass tea. Manuka

791
03:41:39,079 --> 03:41:48,579
honey is superior. Yes, it is. Manuka honey is unbelievable. It's thick though. Manuka honey is,

792
03:41:48,579 --> 03:42:00,840
it's a paste. You get a big chunk of it, stir it in. Manuka honey is really good for you too.

793
03:42:00,840 --> 03:42:15,219
It's like a superfood, isn't it? I'm just getting into tea. This is helpful. You know, I go through

794
03:42:15,219 --> 03:42:24,899
phases. Sometimes I'll drink tea for months and then I won't drink it for a year. It's weird how

795
03:42:24,899 --> 03:42:36,200
you body and your brain decide to do that. Weird. What is the baseball stream? Um, it's the California

796
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:55,270
circus versus the Maryland magicians. A very, very tough game. Very close game. All right, let's go.

797
03:42:55,270 --> 03:43:05,190
Uh, we're, this is where we left off, right? Tea tier list. I used to drink a rooibos red tea,

798
03:43:05,190 --> 03:43:09,159
which is actually not really tea at all. It's not like a tea leaf. It's actually

799
03:43:09,159 --> 03:43:21,239
like a bush or something, right? But I did that because of my digestive problems. It's good. I

800
03:43:21,239 --> 03:43:37,370
think it tastes really good. It's pronounced cannabis, not rooibos. No, it is rooibos. It's

801
03:43:37,370 --> 03:43:53,500
like Roy. Yeah, it's Roy does constipated. No, I'm not going to have colitis. Oh, here we go.

802
03:43:53,500 --> 03:44:06,870
Oh, nevermind. I'm standing here. I've been diagnosed like three times and I've been told

803
03:44:06,870 --> 03:44:17,799
two or three, two or three different things, but we don't need to get into the details of my IBD

804
03:44:18,520 --> 03:44:41,909
because no, just know that I have it. Okay. Thumbs up. Sure thing, dude. Why can't I pick this up?

805
03:44:41,909 --> 03:44:58,299
Fake money. I need a bomb. It's too heavy. Uh, IBS and IBD are different. IBS is irritable bowel

806
03:44:58,299 --> 03:45:06,790
syndrome. IBD is irritable bowel disease. Uh, IBD is something that you have typically for life

807
03:45:08,520 --> 03:45:15,299
and it's usually in the like Crohn's disease, colitis, fructitis. Uh, I believe IBS is a series

808
03:45:15,299 --> 03:45:34,090
of symptoms. I can't get that nickel. I have IBD and I initially got diagnosed with colitis.

809
03:45:34,889 --> 03:45:47,139
This is a long time ago. And then I had another sigmoidoscopy and the doctor was like, Hmm,

810
03:45:48,020 --> 03:45:52,020
no, it still might be colitis, but we're going to treat you for this. Now we're going to treat you

811
03:45:52,020 --> 03:45:58,870
for ulcerative proctitis. I was like, Oh, okay. I went to the doctor again and had a full

812
03:45:58,870 --> 03:46:08,149
colonoscopy. This is back a couple of years ago. Uh, when I took that big break in 2020,

813
03:46:08,549 --> 03:46:23,579
was it 2019? No, no, this was before the break. Uh, how do I do the beast? The same path that I

814
03:46:23,579 --> 03:46:45,110
took before. Just go do a regular run. Okay. Uh, but yeah, during that, during that colonoscopy

815
03:46:45,110 --> 03:46:57,979
that I had, it was kind of, you probably have colitis again. Well, not again, but the way that

816
03:46:57,979 --> 03:47:04,680
colitis and Crohn's disease work is Crohn's disease can affect anywhere all up and down your whole

817
03:47:04,680 --> 03:47:15,430
like gut, all your digestive tract, everything. But colitis and ulcerative colitis and proctitis,

818
03:47:15,430 --> 03:47:30,700
they affect very specific parts of your colon. This is, we're having a while. I haven't talked

819
03:47:30,700 --> 03:47:39,190
about any of my medical problems in a while, but it's time to let's talk about my medical problems.

820
03:47:39,190 --> 03:48:05,190
How much time do you have? All right. Hey, I got all night. Weird to talk about this during Isaac.

821
03:48:06,709 --> 03:48:20,899
What time like the present, right? Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going.

822
03:48:25,559 --> 03:48:36,860
Okay. Now I see why people think this is cool. So the idea is you just do this and clear as

823
03:48:36,860 --> 03:48:56,920
many rooms as you can. Okay. That's really good. Wait, wait, there was ASCII art that got into the

824
03:48:56,920 --> 03:49:10,180
channel. It was there really? That's been a long time since that's happened. Oh, nightbot got it.

825
03:49:10,180 --> 03:49:21,260
Oh, okay. Hey, I, by the way, I'm not encouraging that you're going to get probably timed out or

826
03:49:21,260 --> 03:49:26,299
banned if you do that. It's just, it's been a long time. I've not seen ASCII art in a long time.

827
03:49:29,850 --> 03:49:42,979
Really? That's surprising. So during the Christmas stream, that other channel,

828
03:49:43,989 --> 03:50:01,860
that other channel was just, that was a, that was a fucking mess out of it here. I got enough

829
03:50:01,860 --> 03:50:27,979
money, right? Nope. What about auto ASCII art? I think the problem with ASCII art is not the fact

830
03:50:27,979 --> 03:50:36,459
that it's ASCII art, but the fact that it just blows up. It's the fact that it blows up the whole

831
03:50:36,459 --> 03:50:52,700
chat room. It just takes up the whole thing. And trust me, when I say this, you think I'm going to

832
03:50:52,700 --> 03:50:57,899
actually sit here and tell you, you really think I'm going to sit here and go, why did that thing,

833
03:50:57,899 --> 03:51:02,700
that thing just die? But do you really think I'm going to sit here and tell you that I've never

834
03:51:02,700 --> 03:51:21,620
laughed at ASCII art? You're out of your mind if you think that. You've laughed at ASCII art. Of

835
03:51:21,620 --> 03:51:33,239
course I have. Every single one of you here has. I don't want to, I don't want to hear anybody

836
03:51:33,239 --> 03:51:42,469
pretending in here that they have not chuckled at some form of ASCII art at some point. Well,

837
03:51:42,469 --> 03:51:53,030
I'm not talking about like, no, I'm talking about you just get like, that's kind of funny for a

838
03:51:53,030 --> 03:52:48,260
second. Go, go, go, go. Hurry up. Oh, it's all right. I have something I want to test. Josh,

839
03:52:48,260 --> 03:53:03,239
what do you want to do? You want to test something? Okay. Let's see it. You have the floor, Josh.

840
03:53:09,159 --> 03:53:31,510
Uh oh. Didn't really work. Why did it show up twice? Yeah, it showed up two times. No,

841
03:53:31,510 --> 03:53:42,020
let me scroll up. Where is it? Yeah, it showed up for me two times. I think it was doubled.

842
03:53:52,059 --> 03:53:58,229
It worked on mobile. Probably the size of the chat, right? And whatever your font size is,

843
03:53:59,110 --> 03:54:38,340
size of the window. Uh, Josh, time yourself up for five minutes, by the way. No homing bombs.

844
03:54:38,340 --> 03:54:56,920
See, when I get to the depths too, is when I have to do a different thing. If I even make it there.

845
03:54:56,920 --> 03:55:07,219
Oh, come on. I got it. I did it. Pretty sloppy so far. What's your favorite way to prepare a

846
03:55:07,219 --> 03:55:10,700
chicken? You were saying something about the Christmas stream. Oh, just saying the other

847
03:55:10,700 --> 03:55:15,340
channel had a ton of ASCII art in it. Cause we didn't, I don't, I think the whole thing with

848
03:55:15,340 --> 03:55:20,889
that second channel, we had a couple of meetings about it, like what to do with it. And it was

849
03:55:20,889 --> 03:55:24,889
just like, you know what? Fuck it. Just, just let them do whatever they want. But to an extent,

850
03:55:24,889 --> 03:55:31,100
right? It was like, how much moderating tools do we actually put on there? And it was like,

851
03:55:31,100 --> 03:55:52,629
you know what? Just who cares? Let them have some fun for like 20 minutes. You know, I get you.

852
03:55:53,190 --> 03:55:59,239
This person wrote, dude, can you please talk louder? I'm eating corn nuts. You cannot do

853
03:55:59,239 --> 03:56:07,290
anything while on corn nuts. It is nothing you can do besides sit quietly in a chair and eat them.

854
03:56:08,010 --> 03:56:15,719
There's no activity. There was nothing you can do. It is one of the only foods on earth that

855
03:56:15,719 --> 03:56:24,090
requires total isolation. And I like corn nuts, but that's, that's a really big factor when I'm

856
03:56:24,090 --> 03:56:43,110
like, I don't really want to eat them. Dude. Okay. I got a corn nut story for you. I swear

857
03:56:43,110 --> 03:56:47,909
I was in a hotel room one time and they were corn nuts. Oh yeah. I guess like usually when you,

858
03:56:47,909 --> 03:56:52,389
when you go to a hotel and I do this, I, all right, I'm going to get, I'm going to make sure

859
03:56:52,389 --> 03:56:56,389
I have a couple of waters. Cause I don't, you know, obviously you don't want to, oh, the water

860
03:56:56,389 --> 03:57:00,629
that's on the table is nine dollars. Like, no, no, no, I'm going to get water. I'm going to get a

861
03:57:00,629 --> 03:57:06,180
couple of snacks just to have them in the hotel room. And then one of them was corn nuts. And I

862
03:57:06,180 --> 03:57:10,739
swear, I swear to God at about two o'clock in the morning, I was eating these corn nuts just in the

863
03:57:10,739 --> 03:57:17,139
hotel room. And I was actually scared that I was going to wake up somebody else next to me in the

864
03:57:17,139 --> 03:57:25,340
hotel room next to me. I'm serious. It was like, boom, boom, boom. And I, I, sometimes I felt like

865
03:57:25,340 --> 03:57:35,059
I heard like movement in the other room and I'm like, this is so, am I loud? Like I, it would not

866
03:57:35,139 --> 03:57:42,180
have surprised me if like the 2 a.m. dead silent hotel crunching, somebody heard it.

867
03:57:54,360 --> 03:58:08,569
Somebody said, those are prey instincts. Like, I don't want to hear that. Like the wolves are

868
03:58:08,569 --> 03:58:24,280
going to hear me crunching. Oh my God. That's so funny. Oh, that's wow. That's actually

869
03:58:24,280 --> 03:58:41,139
unbelievably funny. Ray instinct. I'm going to be thinking about that all night.

870
03:58:41,780 --> 03:59:12,360
Shit. I don't want to die. Dude, would tears up make this just disgusting? Well, there it is.

871
03:59:13,899 --> 03:59:28,950
No. Okay. So just go down, right? Not going through there. Did you end up trying ceremonial

872
03:59:28,950 --> 03:59:36,629
matcha yet? I've had it before, but I have not bought it in a long time. I remember having it

873
03:59:36,629 --> 03:59:44,200
like once. Did I, I had like a really good one. I don't know if it was like ceremonial grade. I

874
03:59:44,200 --> 03:59:57,180
don't remember. It may have been. What about mochi? Uh, you're talking about the little

875
03:59:58,139 --> 04:00:04,729
ice cream balls that have the dough on the outside, like the soft dough with the ice cream in the

876
04:00:04,729 --> 04:00:14,469
middle. Okay. I have, I do have opinions on them. My opinions on those are if they are very small

877
04:00:15,399 --> 04:00:20,229
and I mean the size of, you know, the little ones that are like, it's because silver dollar.

878
04:00:22,420 --> 04:00:28,180
Oh, no, no, no, no. That's mochi ice cream. Okay. Okay. Well, I like the mochi ice cream better than

879
04:00:28,180 --> 04:00:34,360
the regular mochi then something about that contrast of that dough and it's not freezing

880
04:00:34,360 --> 04:00:39,000
cold and you bite in and it's like, wow, this is cold. Um, it has to be little though. I don't

881
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:46,979
like the big mochi balls. It's kind of too much, but mochi ice cream is unbelievably. It's

882
04:00:46,979 --> 04:01:08,629
unbelievably good. Mochi ice cream balls are one of those snacks that it's a multi-layered experience

883
04:01:10,700 --> 04:01:17,450
is a visual. The visual is when you bite into it, like you get to see that cold,

884
04:01:18,250 --> 04:01:24,489
like dry ice foam. You know what I mean? That, like that, that mist that when you breathe out

885
04:01:24,489 --> 04:01:31,110
on a freezing cold day, it's like fucking ice breath. Oh, that's a visual. That's what that

886
04:01:31,110 --> 04:01:45,850
adds to it. It only happens for like one second. Sometimes it's just like a little rough and then

887
04:01:45,850 --> 04:01:51,959
it tastes really good. It's got texture for two different kinds of texture flavors. Strawberry

888
04:01:51,959 --> 04:02:00,620
mochi ice cream. I would put up there as probably as high as I could for desserts. I don't, I don't

889
04:02:00,620 --> 04:02:07,579
love the green tea ice cream, green tea mochi. Not a huge fan, but strawberry is holy shit.

890
04:02:10,299 --> 04:02:31,850
Doesn't get better than that. Mango. Oh, I'm not sure I've ever had mango. So I have a question.

891
04:02:31,850 --> 04:02:35,850
Can we, are we ever going to be able to have a conversation about any singular item

892
04:02:36,969 --> 04:02:43,639
without somebody saying that I'm going to put that singular item up my ass? I think we've gone,

893
04:02:43,639 --> 04:03:20,520
I think we've gone too far. The fondler effect. Kill the meme. Kill the meme friend. Kill the meme.

894
04:03:21,239 --> 04:03:39,690
Let the man be born. You brought it up though. Yeah, I told you when I talked about kill the

895
04:03:39,690 --> 04:03:49,379
meme stream too that I'm going to die. Is that I'm a fault of this too? Mike, did I lose? What

896
04:03:49,379 --> 04:04:05,190
happened? Oh, damn it. All right. Well, now that I understand how the character works, I'll do it

897
04:04:05,190 --> 04:04:31,159
again. Restart. Well, my voice sucks. Now I want to do Greedier. There we go. Good start.

898
04:04:32,059 --> 04:04:52,600
Greedier is going to be amazing with this character. Nice. You revive as Lazarus. Oh,

899
04:04:52,680 --> 04:05:07,129
I like that. Oh, this is unbelievable in Greed mode. Sprinkler is a god tier item here. How come

900
04:05:07,129 --> 04:05:13,909
you don't play on keyboard? Every other game you insist on playing keyboard. I do. I feel like I'm

901
04:05:13,909 --> 04:05:22,790
playing on a controller way more than half the time. I prefer controller. Yeah, I usually play

902
04:05:22,790 --> 04:05:30,149
on controller, don't I? Maybe not for like an FPS or something, but most action games I'm on a

903
04:05:30,149 --> 04:05:37,100
controller. Okay. Well, this is good. This is a good start. I'm going to walk through here.

904
04:05:37,659 --> 04:05:59,659
This game's hard on keyboard. Um, anytime where I need to use my right, my WASD is fine, but I don't

905
04:05:59,659 --> 04:06:04,139
know, using like the arrow keys to shoot. I feel like my hand would, my hand kind of hurts after

906
04:06:04,139 --> 04:06:16,520
doing it for a while because you play this game with the right hand on the arrow keys, right?

907
04:06:16,520 --> 04:06:37,700
Yeah. All right, let's do it. I forgot how much Greedier just gives you nothing. All right,

908
04:06:37,700 --> 04:07:06,549
let's go. This is so good here. Wow. I mean, I'm getting, I'm getting hurt, but

909
04:07:07,190 --> 04:07:47,659
only 11 coins. Holy shit. That's bad. Uh, I feel like that's going to kill me. I will die

910
04:07:47,659 --> 04:08:02,489
from this thing. I think that's all good. Pick up. Not, not a troll bomb. Oh, it's regular bombs.

911
04:08:02,489 --> 04:08:15,770
Damn. Okay. That sounds pretty good. I can buy a key. Also pretty good here.

912
04:08:15,770 --> 04:08:37,020
Have you ever had a Ramune? Ramune? Japanese soda. I have not. Ramune. Ramune. Ramune. Okay.

913
04:08:37,020 --> 04:09:20,010
Oh, this might end poorly. Oh God. I'm gonna end poorly. Don't. Oh shit. Damn it. I kind of

914
04:09:20,010 --> 04:09:34,840
got in trouble there. The timer is shorter on Greedier too, right? By a lot, isn't it?

915
04:09:34,840 --> 04:10:14,979
Well, that's good. Good start. Now give me Duffy. Uh, the only Japanese soda that I've ever,

916
04:10:14,979 --> 04:10:26,090
I've wanted to try. It was a, it was a green bottle and it was, what, what was it? It was like a,

917
04:10:26,170 --> 04:10:33,860
like a mango cream soda or something. What was it? It was a, no, yeah, it was a melon soda.

918
04:10:33,860 --> 04:10:41,190
Mango cream soda. Cream melon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was a cream melon cream soda. Is that correct?

919
04:10:42,540 --> 04:10:48,280
Yeah. It was like a milk melon soda. That's like the best one. Is that a good one?

920
04:10:52,040 --> 04:11:01,190
So good. What type of melon? It was, I think green. It was like a green melon.

921
04:11:01,750 --> 04:11:53,610
All right. Let me, uh, I gotta, I gotta focus up here. Okay. 30% fire rate for the left eye only.

922
04:11:54,739 --> 04:12:04,700
Sure. And a key. You said you don't like honeydew or cantaloupe and that they're the same.

923
04:12:04,700 --> 04:12:13,500
Well, not that you put melon in F tier. I need to correct the record. I don't like the melon

924
04:12:14,309 --> 04:12:20,709
fruit. The flavor, the melon flavor is all right. But every time I have melon,

925
04:12:21,430 --> 04:12:27,590
it's the texture is, it's sort of like chewy and hard. It always is the shittiest quality thing

926
04:12:27,590 --> 04:12:33,000
in the fruit cup. It's always like somehow just not good. It's like, I don't know. I feel like

927
04:12:33,000 --> 04:12:42,200
I get a lot of rind pieces or something. It's just not, it's cause it's not ripe enough.

928
04:12:42,200 --> 04:12:48,790
Yeah. But I don't know. But I've had bananas that are not quite all the way ripe and they're

929
04:12:48,790 --> 04:12:59,989
perfect. I like the flavor of a melon, but I just don't like the texture is not like my favorite.

930
04:12:59,989 --> 04:13:18,260
What the hell is this thing? They hated him because he spoke the truth. Hey, whatever fruits you like,

931
04:13:19,590 --> 04:13:28,020
that's up to you. My ideal fruit combinations. If you're talking about your ideal fruit,

932
04:13:28,020 --> 04:13:40,790
what is your ideal fruit scenario? It's fresh strawberries, fresh pineapple, grapes, blueberries.

933
04:13:40,790 --> 04:13:53,590
And that's it. Like if we're talking about mango, mango. Yeah. Apples are right. I like apples alone

934
04:13:53,590 --> 04:14:01,239
though. If I'm talking about like a, cause usually melon is with a bunch of other fruits. You see

935
04:14:01,239 --> 04:14:07,319
melon part of a fruit cup. You see melon on a board with here's a bunch of like cheeses and

936
04:14:07,319 --> 04:14:24,840
crackers and melon and straw. Usually it's not alone. Melon is the best part of the fruit cups.

937
04:14:24,840 --> 04:14:30,790
That pineapple is my favorite part. A good fresh strawberry that doesn't taste like nothing.

938
04:14:32,139 --> 04:14:42,969
Sometimes a lot of strawberries can kind of taste like nothing. Thanks for letting me farm that.

939
04:14:42,969 --> 04:14:58,489
Appreciate it. I was risky, but whatever. I did it. Yeah. Strawberry experience can be really,

940
04:14:58,489 --> 04:15:03,799
really bad. It can be really, really good or really bad. I've been to a strawberry that was

941
04:15:03,799 --> 04:15:07,719
really chewy and had almost no flavor. And then I've been to like a succulent strawberry.

942
04:15:10,379 --> 04:15:13,020
It's like a T it's a commercial. It's like a television commercial eating it.

943
04:15:26,819 --> 04:15:34,870
Homegrown and the most flavorful. Ludwig ate a $500 strawberry on stream. Really? Was it,

944
04:15:34,870 --> 04:15:42,729
was it fucking good? Holy shit. Don't go in that. Okay. Yeah. Cause I want the angel room.

945
04:15:45,020 --> 04:15:57,479
It was mid it was mid. It wasn't, it was not very good. It was just normal. It wasn't worth the

946
04:15:57,479 --> 04:16:08,250
price. Honestly, 500 bucks to me is, I just don't, I don't think there's like a fresh fruit or I

947
04:16:08,250 --> 04:16:14,139
don't think there's, I don't know if there's a food item that I think is like individually singly

948
04:16:14,139 --> 04:16:23,129
worth $500 to me. I think you can get pretty much any high quality food is I mean, it's talking

949
04:16:23,129 --> 04:16:27,850
about like at a restaurant at least like even like a place that's like a couple hundred bucks

950
04:16:27,850 --> 04:16:34,629
a plate. I don't know if you go very much higher than that. After that, it just becomes, well,

951
04:16:34,629 --> 04:16:43,340
we missed it with a, a candied mist spray. It's like, let me just eat the fucking strawberry,

952
04:16:43,340 --> 04:16:50,020
dude. Like, I don't, who cares. It's coated in a thin layer of, of mango film. It's like,

953
04:16:50,020 --> 04:17:07,059
is that really worth 700 bucks? Not really. 500 bucks. That's crazy. That sounds pretty good

954
04:17:07,059 --> 04:17:36,170
though. Yeah. You spend 500 bucks on more important stuff like family guy. That's right. I'm way

955
04:17:36,170 --> 04:17:53,260
better at this than you. I, I bet you are count on it actually. Uh, that's the thing. No. Okay. So

956
04:17:53,260 --> 04:18:02,309
wait, somebody said family guy 30 season box set. Is it 500 bucks? Think about all the laughs you

957
04:18:02,309 --> 04:18:16,329
could have one strawberry for the family guy, entire box set collection is that's talking about

958
04:18:16,329 --> 04:18:31,219
the value on that one. None of you are taking the strawberry. Get out of here. I guarantee none of

959
04:18:31,219 --> 04:18:56,010
you would take the strawberry. Whoa. Oh my God. I don't know how much heart, how many hearts I have.

960
04:18:56,010 --> 04:19:33,239
This is actually kind of scary. Stop. Stop. Stop. I hate these enemies. Here we go. HP and luck up.

961
04:19:33,239 --> 04:19:50,010
Your size up. You need some more range. That's pretty abysmal. Isn't it? You could look back

962
04:19:50,010 --> 04:20:11,659
on eating a $500 strawberry and laugh. Yeah, you could. There's value there. I'm buying this. Eh,

963
04:20:11,659 --> 04:20:17,899
I thought it was going to, it could have been the diamond. It could have been the one that doubles.

964
04:20:17,899 --> 04:20:48,149
It was dumb. It was five bucks. I didn't, it wasn't 500 die. If I do that anymore. Well,

965
04:20:48,149 --> 04:21:00,329
here's range. I'm scared to do the nightmare mode because I feel like I'm going to lose. I feel like

966
04:21:00,329 --> 04:21:45,219
I'm going to die. Oh, fuck. I didn't get a key. I'm dead. I'm alive. Bowl mapping effect

967
04:21:45,219 --> 04:21:57,639
spawns a random wisp, spawns one additional wisp with each use up to 12. And this one is worthless,

968
04:21:57,639 --> 04:22:12,600
right? Your faith grows. I don't, wait, I don't get it. A random wisp on one wisp with each use.

969
04:22:16,760 --> 04:22:29,399
So will this just refill every time I, the button is pressed? I think so, right? I wish I had more

970
04:22:29,399 --> 04:22:42,840
money because that's very needed right now. Oh, let's be dumb and cool, but I don't want it.

971
04:22:42,840 --> 04:23:11,030
I mean, that's nice. That's pretty good. I don't have any more money. Oh, no. Oh, this is the,

972
04:23:11,030 --> 04:23:19,540
wait a minute. Oh my God. I can, everything's fine. Oh my goodness. Wait, should I open this

973
04:23:19,540 --> 04:23:33,850
or should I buy? Hold on. I'm doing it. Nice. Um, all right. I'm going to buy a key. I forgot

974
04:23:33,850 --> 04:23:50,790
I even had that. Oh, it's the lard, right? That's what it is. God, don't flex an enemy or projectile

975
04:23:50,790 --> 04:23:59,239
right before Isaac would take damage from it. It needs to deflect projectiles near it. It needs

976
04:23:59,239 --> 04:24:08,540
to be touched after deflecting to be reactivated. Holy shit. Nah, I think this thing is better.

977
04:24:09,690 --> 04:24:38,389
Wait a minute. Like a dollar. You can use ace on enemies. Oh, I thought it was an

978
04:24:38,389 --> 04:24:46,969
item on the ground. All right. So if I use this right now, what happens before I do it?

979
04:24:46,969 --> 04:24:55,399
Poker chip. 50% chance for chest to spawn extra pickups or to contain a single fly.

980
04:24:56,120 --> 04:25:13,219
Money. I know what that does. I know what that does. Good. Inexpensive keys. Very good. Very

981
04:25:13,219 --> 04:25:37,239
good. It will spawn a wisp. But will it refill? Nice. Okay. Let's try it. This thing has already

982
04:25:37,239 --> 04:26:17,930
protected me twice. Why is this thing so little? Where'd he go? Where's my friend? Where's my

983
04:26:17,930 --> 04:26:52,549
friend? Geez. Oh my goodness. These things just spam. Oh my disaster. Actually a disaster. All

984
04:26:52,549 --> 04:27:19,819
right. Damn. That's it in a locked gold chest. You gotta be kidding me. What are you saying?

985
04:27:19,819 --> 04:27:25,059
Seven bombs. Removes the delay between bomb placements. You can just spam it.

986
04:27:25,620 --> 04:27:35,860
It's kind of terrifying. Oh, so it keeps leveling up. I get it. Well, hopefully I can make it to

987
04:27:36,420 --> 04:28:04,729
probably probable. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, I'm not very good with this character.

988
04:28:04,729 --> 04:28:15,190
Two up close and personal. You get that speed and you sprint around. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

989
04:28:15,190 --> 04:28:37,909
I was never very good with melee in this game. I like range. Let me use original Samsung. Tainted

990
04:28:37,909 --> 04:28:51,219
Lost. I'll try it after this. This is actually my favorite character. When I said it was came,

991
04:28:51,219 --> 04:29:41,420
it was alive. I made it up. That was an unbelievable room. Oh, should I do that?

992
04:29:41,659 --> 04:29:49,620
Should I do that right now? Should I hold this for a little longer? I made the whole thing up.

993
04:29:49,620 --> 04:30:40,040
Do it now. It's a lot of money. We're getting to use the head. Oh, that's great. 25 coins on

994
04:30:40,040 --> 04:30:54,340
the ground. This is how you make greedier actually reliably doable because now I'm essentially the

995
04:30:54,340 --> 04:30:58,899
coins that are on the ground are the coins that I would have had in regular greed mode throughout

996
04:30:58,899 --> 04:31:07,719
the course of the whole playthrough. So let's go. Like these are the amount of coins that I would

997
04:31:07,719 --> 04:31:12,920
have had throughout the whole playthrough. Get lucky with a card. It's not really reliable.

998
04:31:15,209 --> 04:31:24,520
Multiple Isaac's damage, tears, range and speed stats, which multiplies Isaac's damage.

999
04:31:30,940 --> 04:31:55,879
What's the recharge on this? It's bad. The range. What? Did I already go in there?

1000
04:31:55,879 --> 04:32:11,719
No, I didn't. Did I? I don't remember going in there. I went in there already. I went in there.

1001
04:32:11,719 --> 04:32:18,579
I'm thinking about the last playthrough. They blend together sometimes. All right. I'm gonna

1002
04:32:18,579 --> 04:32:53,799
this is dumb, but it might be brilliant. Let's find out. Here's bad. It was a bad idea. Hey,

1003
04:32:53,879 --> 04:32:58,860
never going to, you're never going to get the cool crazy thing. You don't try the cool crazy thing.

1004
04:32:58,860 --> 04:33:06,490
You could have dropped something unbelievable and everybody here would have been going home.

1005
04:33:06,490 --> 04:33:25,099
Holy shit, dude. You're so fucking cool, man. Just do you put the cool, man. You see, hey,

1006
04:33:25,099 --> 04:33:33,849
like, Hey, did you see what item he just found? I was called an idiot, but like, I mean, I don't

1007
04:33:33,849 --> 04:33:39,110
know. I think he's just, I don't know. He's like the coolest guy I've ever seen. I do not go in

1008
04:33:39,110 --> 04:33:59,029
there. Ego boosted over a kid's game. I think I would probably not want a kid to play this game.

1009
04:33:59,029 --> 04:34:24,490
I think that would be very bad. I don't think that would be a great thing. And that's the reason why

1010
04:34:25,720 --> 04:34:30,759
I opened that up with the key. Don't have a key anymore. Got the pill that opened the fucking

1011
04:34:30,759 --> 04:34:44,310
secret that has, look what's in here. A crazy door. What is that? Does this go anywhere different?

1012
04:34:46,330 --> 04:34:54,790
Nothing. It just goes down. It's the exact same one. Really? I think it just goes to the next

1013
04:34:54,790 --> 04:35:07,560
floor. Oh, if it has the ladder, that means it's like an item room, right? That's okay.

1014
04:35:07,560 --> 04:35:29,049
Yeah. Chairman, dude, that was so cool. Oh, it's up to my throat. Not good, but better than nothing.

1015
04:35:29,049 --> 04:35:34,520
I think, I think my body wants to sneeze probably what's about to happen. Yep.

1016
04:35:48,099 --> 04:35:51,860
One heart container while held was one coin container for keeper.

1017
04:35:56,919 --> 04:36:10,709
Thank you. Which one of these is better? It's just a health up.

1018
04:36:29,340 --> 04:37:44,580
Ooh, another tier is up right there. Nice. Come on. Good block. I hate how the elite

1019
04:37:44,580 --> 04:38:05,700
champions do a full heart. You'd be patched out of the game. That's like a really interesting

1020
04:38:05,700 --> 04:38:14,500
mechanic where it's, it's like, it should be the way that it is. The weird glitch. Yeah. It's like,

1021
04:38:14,500 --> 04:38:21,700
I don't know, glitched out. They should just remove taking damage. You know, I like, I was

1022
04:38:21,700 --> 04:38:28,779
going to say that, but I, yeah, I, I think I agree. Like I shouldn't be able to get hurt.

1023
04:38:29,659 --> 04:38:43,110
Like the top left should be nothing there. Like shit should just bounce off of me.

1024
04:38:43,110 --> 04:39:27,369
God, get in there. Will you stay still for a second? Get over here. You know,

1025
04:39:27,369 --> 04:39:33,159
I have a question for you all to be honest. This is a very, very interesting discussion

1026
04:39:33,159 --> 04:39:40,889
because I'm telling you, I would love it. Hear me out. This is really, really interesting to me.

1027
04:39:40,889 --> 04:39:55,479
So Polly and I are sitting on the couch and I was playing a game. So that's not the whole story.

1028
04:39:55,479 --> 04:40:05,720
So during this game, what do you mean I wasn't? Wait, let me tell my story. Okay. So that we,

1029
04:40:05,720 --> 04:40:12,759
we got food and I was playing and it's like, okay, so I'm playing this game. I'm controlling

1030
04:40:12,759 --> 04:40:20,459
my character running around. I'm doing stuff, but I want to eat. I want to eat. We want to eat food

1031
04:40:20,540 --> 04:40:28,740
and hang out on the couch. I wish I could press a button to have a bot take over and play the game

1032
04:40:28,740 --> 04:40:40,939
for me. Just like AI plays while I just sit there and eat. Don't you think that would be so cool?

1033
04:40:40,939 --> 04:40:44,540
Like I'm talking about, yeah, I'm talking about like a left for dead two bot mode where for

1034
04:40:44,540 --> 04:40:48,299
instance, like, like a wild hearts. I've been playing wild hearts. I have a fucking hilarious

1035
04:40:48,299 --> 04:40:51,180
clip that you guys need to see too, by the way. It's unbelievably funny. It's the funniest thing

1036
04:40:51,180 --> 04:40:58,659
I've seen all month and I'm not kidding. Um, so I just want to press a button and just have my

1037
04:40:58,659 --> 04:41:03,750
characters kind of walk around and like pick up stuff and like attack enemies and stuff. That's

1038
04:41:03,750 --> 04:41:09,020
just a movie, but it's temporary. Just pause it. No, but I want to like, I want, I want to continue

1039
04:41:09,020 --> 04:41:19,849
the, I want to continue. Just hold down select for five seconds and we'll, okay. We're in left for

1040
04:41:19,849 --> 04:41:24,229
dead two bot mode. It's just a bot takes over your character and you can sit there and eat your

1041
04:41:24,229 --> 04:41:27,750
cheeseburger, have your fries and like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the way I wanted to go.

1042
04:41:27,750 --> 04:41:34,169
And essentially the game plays for you for a little bit temporary. Just let Holly play while you eat.

1043
04:41:34,169 --> 04:41:42,020
She's eating too. That's stupid. I don't think, I think it's actually an interesting thing.

1044
04:41:42,020 --> 04:41:45,939
You don't think it would be kind of cool just to be like, all right, you play temporarily and it

1045
04:41:45,939 --> 04:41:59,939
would have, look, why not? I think that would be a really cool feature. This is why you have a child.

1046
04:41:59,939 --> 04:42:07,220
Hey, hey son, come here. Hey, uh, your mom and your dear old dad over here want to eat our, uh,

1047
04:42:07,220 --> 04:42:19,540
look at McDonald's. Can you play, uh, wild hearts? What's even the point of the game? Well, I'm not,

1048
04:42:19,540 --> 04:42:29,130
I'm not, not going to play. I just, while I'm eating, it's just in food mode. It's food mode.

1049
04:42:29,130 --> 04:42:34,840
Like, Oh, like start right bumper, right bumper, right bumper settings down, down, down, down, down,

1050
04:42:34,840 --> 04:42:43,340
down, food mode off, food mode on big thing pops up on screen. You have activated food mode. Food

1051
04:42:43,340 --> 04:42:49,099
mode is a feature in wild hearts that tells you, well, it's the bot will take over. Uh, it can't

1052
04:42:49,099 --> 04:43:02,740
do certain things. And then I can press like, uh, like a combination of buttons to turn it on.

1053
04:43:02,740 --> 04:43:08,500
Chat is, chat is over here watching you play a game, probably eating and then calling you stupid

1054
04:43:08,500 --> 04:43:19,450
for doing, wanting to do the same thing. Luigi mode, but it wouldn't be Luigi mode. It would be

1055
04:43:19,450 --> 04:43:39,930
a, like a voluntary Luigi mode, but that's good marbles. Oh wait. Oh yeah. I'm laying in bed. I'm

1056
04:43:39,930 --> 04:43:51,299
drawing, but you could cheese with it. Well, no, the AI would be very bad at the game. I'm talking

1057
04:43:51,299 --> 04:43:56,419
like, I think about this just, hold on. I know everyone's kind of, you know, going, what the

1058
04:43:56,419 --> 04:44:03,529
fuck? Okay. I'm going to press on the map. This is where I want to walk to. This is my, like an

1059
04:44:03,529 --> 04:44:10,299
open world game, right? This is my destination. It don't go there and like walk there and on the way

1060
04:44:10,299 --> 04:44:15,619
pick up some fucking herbs on the ground. Right. And maybe pick up a side quest along the way.

1061
04:44:15,619 --> 04:44:18,259
And I'm just sitting there eating and just watching it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. This is exactly

1062
04:44:18,259 --> 04:44:33,819
what I would have done if I didn't have grease all over my hands. What about it? Could food mode be

1063
04:44:33,819 --> 04:44:43,689
millennia? I don't know. No, no. Cause all exactly. That's exactly what I mean. Food mode would not

1064
04:44:43,689 --> 04:44:48,819
be good enough to do very much of anything at all. It would only be good enough to traverse

1065
04:44:48,819 --> 04:44:56,250
terrain, to pick up items, to, to like attack and you know, move to like the area of like a quest

1066
04:44:56,250 --> 04:45:03,740
or something. Right. It wouldn't really be able to do, be able to do very much. That is a slothful

1067
04:45:03,740 --> 04:45:13,750
idea. It's not that bad. It's an auto farm tool. No, it would, but what if we had like a five,

1068
04:45:13,750 --> 04:45:21,020
no, how long does it take to eat? Okay. It was, you could only activate it 30 minutes a day total.

1069
04:45:21,340 --> 04:45:26,229
Food mode would not activate. It would say, sorry, you've already used food mode for 30 minutes.

1070
04:45:26,229 --> 04:45:51,909
Please come back in 24 hours when food mode is reactivated. I think I don't want any of these.

1071
04:45:51,909 --> 04:45:56,900
I think it's a good idea. You know, how many times I've just sat there where I was in the middle of

1072
04:45:56,900 --> 04:46:03,139
something, a middle of, I don't want to stop really necessarily playing the game. I would like to have

1073
04:46:03,139 --> 04:46:09,099
it play it for me while I just sit here for 15 to 20 minutes, not long. And maybe have it like kill

1074
04:46:09,099 --> 04:46:13,900
a couple of monsters or something and then like, oh cool. Oh yeah. Oh, what dropped? Oh, nice.

1075
04:46:13,900 --> 04:46:30,459
And then I turned to Holly and we high five each other with these greasy ass fucking hands.

1076
04:46:30,459 --> 04:46:40,340
Nice. Blade and soul kind of has that in some areas. It's a shit game though.

1077
04:46:44,790 --> 04:47:12,520
All right. Okay. Nobody likes my food mode idea. Take the file. I ate it. Take the heart.

1078
04:47:12,520 --> 04:47:17,319
Taking damage depletes red hearts before soul hearts. The red heart damage can lower your

1079
04:47:17,319 --> 04:47:27,099
devil angel room chance. Why would I want to do that? What if it was a special code from

1080
04:47:27,099 --> 04:47:30,860
takeout places? Like in the box, you get a QR code that gives you one hour of food mode.

1081
04:47:30,860 --> 04:47:42,150
That sounds pretty hype. Yeah. Like super Mario, super Mario Odyssey two.

1082
04:47:44,919 --> 04:47:54,630
It's with its, it's cross promotion with pizza hut. If you get a large three topping pizza,

1083
04:47:54,630 --> 04:47:58,630
Mario will play the game for you when you want to just sit there and have your garlic sauce

1084
04:47:59,189 --> 04:48:12,659
and dip it. Yeah. Fucking perfect. This is dystopia dude. Yeah. Oh,

1085
04:48:19,990 --> 04:48:23,669
you are encouraging the fall of Western civilization.

1086
04:48:24,869 --> 04:48:33,029
All because I want to be able to eat a fucking steak on the couch and have a bot play a game

1087
04:48:33,029 --> 04:48:49,909
for me for five minutes. I disagree. All of a Western civilization. I think it's a good idea.

1088
04:48:49,909 --> 04:49:03,060
Oh, I've got to hold on. Can we evolve this idea? So what if instead of the thing you all hate,

1089
04:49:03,060 --> 04:49:09,540
what if you press the button and the it's food mode turns on and the character sits down and

1090
04:49:09,540 --> 04:49:15,770
a cut scene plays and it's a, it's a long, like 10 to 15 minute long cut scene where they're

1091
04:49:15,770 --> 04:49:23,529
just a two or three of the characters in the game are eating at a table. And we're all eating.

1092
04:49:23,529 --> 04:49:32,279
We're all hanging out and eating together. I'm done. I'm done. I swear I'm done.

1093
04:49:43,860 --> 04:49:51,259
Oh man. It's Mar. Yeah. It's Mario and Luigi are like eating pizza and like spinach and

1094
04:49:51,259 --> 04:49:59,740
spaghetti and stuff. And like Mario's like, Ooh, Luigi, the sauce is phenomenal. Oh Mario,

1095
04:49:59,740 --> 04:50:05,259
have some of the garlic bread. Oh, what are you eating? And he looks up into the camera,

1096
04:50:05,259 --> 04:50:11,299
looks right at you. And then he sits there and waits for you to tell him. Oh, that sounds

1097
04:50:11,299 --> 04:50:13,540
Mama Mia, that sounds delicious. Oh

1098
04:50:41,490 --> 04:50:43,659
Pilk

1099
04:50:43,939 --> 04:50:45,580
Mama Mia

1100
04:50:45,580 --> 04:50:47,580
How do you love still?

1101
04:50:47,659 --> 04:50:58,639
Just to be careful. You might to get a diarrhea

1102
04:50:59,400 --> 04:51:21,819
But that's horrifying. That's so sad. Yeah, but you don't think that that would be funny or like interesting

1103
04:51:21,819 --> 04:51:25,700
I feel like I would be if I that was in a Mario game. I feel like this is so funny

1104
04:51:25,700 --> 04:51:30,259
This is so like cute. It's just like there's like an eating we could just like watch them

1105
04:51:33,909 --> 04:51:43,610
Games need food mode. I want this these are free to go in now

1106
04:51:46,650 --> 04:51:56,020
What is that holding the item causes non-ghost enemies to spawn small red ghosts on

1107
04:51:56,720 --> 04:51:58,000
death this

1108
04:51:58,000 --> 04:52:00,180
Like more enemies

1109
04:52:00,180 --> 04:52:16,419
There's a lot here. So hold on. So when I kill something it turns into a ghost the ghost hangs out

1110
04:52:16,979 --> 04:52:22,950
Using the item causes the ghosts over there. You blow them all up using the item also kills any ghost enemies

1111
04:52:23,349 --> 04:52:31,110
Wait including bosses. Wait, okay. I'm curious. I want to try it. Is it a one time?

1112
04:52:31,110 --> 04:52:46,340
Is it and I use it many times I want I had to take that because I wouldn't have an opportunity to

1113
04:52:46,939 --> 04:53:18,459
It's infinite. So how often should I use this thing? Whoa, don't wait. It's just okay. So I don't have to oh

1114
04:53:21,319 --> 04:53:31,430
Interesting kind of fucked. I'm not gonna lie especially in a little space like this

1115
04:53:36,540 --> 04:53:39,500
Okay, I'm like paying almost more attention to that than the actual game

1116
04:53:40,060 --> 04:54:11,419
Okay, they don't all they don't hurt you for some reason I was assuming they did the explosions hurt it might

1117
04:54:12,330 --> 04:54:14,450
I'm not taking this because I want to hey

1118
04:54:14,450 --> 04:54:23,200
I want to help you want to get a bunch of them on screen and blow them up. They don't alright

1119
04:54:23,200 --> 04:54:31,520
That's good to know that the explosion doesn't hurt you. They don't hurt you. I thought that they did good to know

1120
04:54:31,659 --> 04:55:05,130
Yeah, well, we'll wrap it up after this too. Whatever happens here. This would be the last run. They already went in there. Anyways, thank you for the speed

1121
04:55:05,130 --> 04:55:23,509
Oh, that's right. I turned off all spikes. I'm gonna check the secret room

1122
04:55:23,689 --> 04:55:41,409
Having a bomb doesn't this do something you can blow this up and it goes down or it heals fully heal. All right, good

1123
04:55:43,479 --> 04:55:53,540
Chaos all items are chosen from random item pulls spawns one to six random pickups wacky

1124
04:55:53,560 --> 04:56:03,259
Yeah, the wind has died yet. I'm glad that the card didn't come up

1125
04:56:03,259 --> 04:56:23,549
It's eight the other thing the other trinket. I think I'm just gonna hold it for until like a boss

1126
04:56:23,869 --> 04:56:33,150
It's probably the best thing to do, right? I need more

1127
04:56:33,669 --> 04:56:46,729
My tears are kind of bad. All right, stop talking. I'm sorry. I had to those things are awful

1128
04:56:46,729 --> 04:56:59,860
I feel like I'm not killing anything. Look at how slow I'm that my damage is so high too. What's going on here?

1129
04:56:59,860 --> 04:57:33,139
I oh

1130
04:57:33,139 --> 04:58:22,950
I'm a stupid person over here get over here bro turned on food mode and didn't think we'd notice

1131
04:58:25,259 --> 04:58:35,450
Is it chaos or is it I need heels chaos?

1132
04:58:35,490 --> 04:58:49,409
Ooh job breakers good and then soul of the loss turns the player into the loss allows taking one devil room item for free

1133
04:58:49,409 --> 04:59:10,599
That's bad humor the strutting that ass guy. Yeah strutting that ass strutting that ass

1134
04:59:11,119 --> 04:59:17,689
You get you walk to gutters. You're gonna be so fucking tired. You wouldn't be strutting that ass

1135
04:59:17,970 --> 04:59:27,799
Why don't you walk to good? Why don't you walk to good? I don't want to walk to go

1136
04:59:27,799 --> 04:59:46,020
Oh, why don't you walk to good? Of course, I've seen it before who is he?

1137
04:59:46,020 --> 04:59:50,180
What are you talking about? What? All right, if you don't know what that is, then I do sound

1138
04:59:51,180 --> 05:00:24,009
Ridiculous right now. It's a it's a video. It's like an old meme video. I go in it's a boomer meme

1139
05:00:24,450 --> 05:00:38,009
Somebody asked and I answered that sounds cool

1140
05:00:38,610 --> 05:00:52,630
Things pretty cool, right? You gave a whole performance. I

1141
05:00:55,090 --> 05:01:02,540
Mean, I've just ever I remembered the video could have had it for free

1142
05:01:02,540 --> 05:01:08,290
But when I turned to the loss doesn't it mess up my whole character gives me like three soul hearts

1143
05:01:08,450 --> 05:01:20,560
No, I can I die in one hit or something right it's one room it was temporary. Oh, well then I'll take it

1144
05:01:30,000 --> 05:01:33,470
Holy shit that item is really good. Oh

1145
05:01:35,799 --> 05:01:40,200
Come on that item is unbelievable. Stop doing that to me. Oh

1146
05:01:42,709 --> 05:02:29,319
Thank you worst item in the game. I'll take this though. This is really good. This is pretty good, too

1147
05:02:46,639 --> 05:02:59,209
I really don't want to do this but I'm gonna okay. There's a thing. Oh, yeah

1148
05:03:01,810 --> 05:03:21,319
Does that button ever do anything good? I feel like every time I press that bad things happen in this room

1149
05:03:21,319 --> 05:03:27,759
I've never had a good thing happen when I press one of those in the breed shop. It's like almost never

1150
05:03:39,279 --> 05:04:03,400
Mmm, I think I'm good to go by the $5 one. Why would you buy this 50% chance to explode? No, thank you

1151
05:04:11,340 --> 05:04:15,599
Salvation almost just walked into the

1152
05:04:16,380 --> 05:04:38,970
Bad technique. All right, let's go. What happened to my item. What's going on? I'm fucking confused. What happened? What happened? What's going on?

1153
05:04:38,970 --> 05:04:51,259
This is rerolling enemies. Wait this stupid thing that I picked up who told me to pick this up

1154
05:04:51,360 --> 05:04:58,400
Who told me to pick this up? It's this is on you. This is on you. Why did you tell me to pick this up?

1155
05:04:58,400 --> 05:05:04,520
I thought that was it. Oh, no. Oh

1156
05:05:06,569 --> 05:05:10,630
No, this would be this was that was gonna be so good for super greed

1157
05:05:11,409 --> 05:05:14,630
Because of all the shit that he spawns. Oh, no

1158
05:05:15,250 --> 05:05:19,029
Why did I listen you?

1159
05:05:20,029 --> 05:05:32,540
You've rerolled it I don't know I just let me read it this is not an okay active item is top-left

1160
05:05:33,540 --> 05:05:39,709
Consumable is bottom right? I might as well just reroll it but I can't use it anymore, right?

1161
05:05:39,790 --> 05:05:57,830
You'd only listen to me. I have 600 hours in this game. You need a key. I need a key

1162
05:05:57,990 --> 05:06:07,939
All right, I need a key. I need a key name somebody on this fucking website that can do a barbarian like that

1163
05:06:08,099 --> 05:06:35,360
Uh, I think it's okay little neff. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. I agree

1164
05:06:35,360 --> 05:06:57,680
Let's do it again. Can that in this stack if I stand right next somebody can it be like

1165
05:06:59,319 --> 05:07:05,040
It's really good you do that again and hit me again. I'm gonna scream

1166
05:07:07,119 --> 05:07:26,750
Internally, okay. So here we go. So you're telling me that if I use this I get this for free

1167
05:07:26,909 --> 05:07:44,479
You have chaos. Yeah, don't use it

1168
05:07:44,479 --> 05:07:53,240
Oh, but what if I go I'm I don't all right get this shit out of here

1169
05:07:53,240 --> 05:07:55,319
So if I do this now

1170
05:07:55,319 --> 05:07:57,400
Well, will I actually can I still do it?

1171
05:07:57,400 --> 05:08:02,680
No, is it because chaos really mess everything up the flush thing would be kind of good for the next room or two

1172
05:08:03,000 --> 05:08:12,180
Just wait for everything to spawn and turn everything to shit and flush it these items suck

1173
05:08:13,979 --> 05:08:21,619
Chaos made all the items. Oh, that's right. I'm doing it

1174
05:08:24,830 --> 05:08:28,959
That's free

1175
05:08:28,959 --> 05:08:47,169
Yeah, okay. I have flight now too. I want this shield of tears. It just really good

1176
05:08:47,290 --> 05:08:59,459
I'm gonna buy another heart too. Are you gonna see the Mario movie? Oh, yeah, absolutely

1177
05:09:00,220 --> 05:09:10,860
another judgment

1178
05:09:10,860 --> 05:09:13,389
Judgment god damn it fine

1179
05:09:13,990 --> 05:09:29,229
What? Oh, it's an item from the current rooms item pool

1180
05:09:29,750 --> 05:09:35,799
So I go into the stop the store and do that. It's one heart container. Okay, that's fine

1181
05:09:36,500 --> 05:09:55,959
Okay shit. Okay, robo, baby

1182
05:09:56,700 --> 05:10:02,990
All right shit. I've I got to greedy. It's all right. I have the toilet thing. I can plunge

1183
05:10:03,229 --> 05:10:28,080
Why would I do that? I don't know. What about secret room? I could probably find it the right the left

1184
05:10:32,799 --> 05:10:41,950
Bottom. Hey the runs over do just drink some Ramune on stream and call it a night

1185
05:10:42,669 --> 05:10:51,060
You might be right. All right, we're good arts arts in here

1186
05:10:58,459 --> 05:11:00,770
Her new room

1187
05:11:00,810 --> 05:11:08,009
You're gonna single use a dice consumable item. The dice disappears when leaving the dice does not take up a pill slot

1188
05:11:09,009 --> 05:11:29,169
Okay, blow up the reroll machine, I don't think I want to do that now that that's not gonna do anything for me

1189
05:11:29,689 --> 05:11:33,209
All right. Let's go

1190
05:11:33,330 --> 05:11:51,560
Let's go quietly. It's late. What's the d12? It's the eternal d6. Holy shit

1191
05:11:51,560 --> 05:12:07,669
Give me that do the d6 in the shop like right now. Whoa

1192
05:12:08,310 --> 05:12:20,500
Okay

1193
05:12:20,500 --> 05:12:29,380
What is the eternal d6 online? I'm a little good. I need to look at my whole loadout. How do I drop everything?

1194
05:12:29,380 --> 05:12:37,939
I'm holding down right trigger the curse room

1195
05:12:37,979 --> 05:12:44,450
Yeah, I just what the fuck I want that person timed out for a hundred hours

1196
05:12:44,490 --> 05:13:05,900
How did I get hurt you immediately do everything one guy tells you not true. What is my item? What's going on?

1197
05:13:06,099 --> 05:13:17,430
Would my item go what happened to the thing that I just did just turned into it. Did it explode read it read what?

1198
05:13:27,009 --> 05:13:29,009
Damn it. It's

1199
05:13:30,889 --> 05:13:48,860
Fuck man, that's like I don't I'll be alright. We're good. We're good. We're good. Everybody relax watch this

1200
05:13:48,939 --> 05:14:13,950
Why they're not all flushed? Why is it not everybody's still here? Oh

1201
05:14:18,599 --> 05:14:38,340
No, it didn't work the way I thought it was gonna work that jump was fucking stupid this game

1202
05:14:38,340 --> 05:14:48,459
I just got I don't know. I'm tired. I fucked it up. I'm tired

1203
05:14:48,659 --> 05:14:53,279
God damn it one more one more and I'm gonna try as hard as I can

1204
05:14:53,279 --> 05:15:01,110
It all went to shit when I picked up that stupid bag of whatever it is

1205
05:15:01,229 --> 05:15:23,409
What is this enemy kill drop red half hearts that despair after two seconds? I don't know if you gamble on greedier

1206
05:15:23,409 --> 05:15:37,830
That's probably a bad idea. All right, this is actually the one I'm going to really try and I'm gonna pay attention

1207
05:15:37,830 --> 05:15:42,400
We're not gonna have a food mode notice when we started talking about food mode

1208
05:15:43,919 --> 05:17:27,119
The gaming skill dropped by like 70% its game. I'm here. That's better. There we go clean dish

1209
05:17:27,119 --> 05:18:06,000
Oh what no, it was such a bad placement

1210
05:18:06,639 --> 05:18:09,080
Stop talking me. I can't play and talk at the same time

1211
05:18:09,119 --> 05:18:33,979
What we got sometimes burst out of the ground and grabs an enemy levitates in front of Isaac deals damage

1212
05:18:34,220 --> 05:18:59,009
Isaac's damage six times per second. This is good, too. Well, let's find out what's in here ghost bombs

1213
05:18:59,090 --> 05:19:06,450
How do we know you're not eating right now?

1214
05:19:06,810 --> 05:19:11,610
Now I was thinking about just queuing up a bunch of crunching sounds on YouTube or something and just playing and being quiet

1215
05:19:11,889 --> 05:19:32,500
But it's too much for me right now. I kind of this is kind of cool. This is way more practical

1216
05:19:32,979 --> 05:19:46,310
I'm gonna do it. I know it's the I'm doing the lame thing, but I want to stay alive. Does this hurt me?

1217
05:19:46,549 --> 05:20:01,830
Plus the two kids that's ten cents that I'm not gonna have to spend. That's good

1218
05:20:27,090 --> 05:20:39,919
I'm not going in it. What's this game about? It's about killing things attacking upgrading

1219
05:20:40,720 --> 05:20:49,040
Random die do it again win do it again

1220
05:20:56,470 --> 05:21:00,430
Okay, let's go and I'm gonna activate that

1221
05:21:01,630 --> 05:21:26,529
Magdalene thing or a boros worm. Nope panic button. No, that's bad, too

1222
05:21:27,169 --> 05:21:40,900
Taking damage uses the active item if it's charged. Why would I want that? How many seconds behind him? I read this

1223
05:21:42,889 --> 05:21:45,689
Well, here's the good way to do it so

1224
05:21:47,049 --> 05:21:49,610
That's an interesting experiment. I like the experiment you want to do

1225
05:21:50,169 --> 05:21:56,490
You do this experiment is I clap and then you say clap the second that you hear clap and I'll tell you

1226
05:21:56,490 --> 05:22:00,200
I'll give you the exact time ready. Don't do it yet

1227
05:22:00,880 --> 05:22:03,520
No, no, no, don't do it yet. I didn't do it yet. Don't do it yet

1228
05:22:09,659 --> 05:22:15,869
dog five seconds

1229
05:22:16,900 --> 05:22:24,180
So I said dog and then five seconds went by and it was over in chat. So if you're ever wondering

1230
05:22:24,819 --> 05:22:29,580
Like wow, I can't believe how does he not we told him to go left, but he went right

1231
05:22:30,099 --> 05:22:33,779
Because when I went right it took five seconds for you to tell me to go left

1232
05:22:33,779 --> 05:22:53,580
So you like we we were always miscommunicating by five seconds. What does this tell it? Wow, that's pretty good for three seconds

1233
05:22:53,619 --> 05:23:16,529
It's a lot my favorite thing here. Is this working greed mode? That's amazing

1234
05:23:16,529 --> 05:23:27,319
All right, I actually have to really I don't I don't want to lose this looks like this great items here low latency

1235
05:23:27,319 --> 05:23:33,060
I I think I have low latency turned on the second that that feature was available. I turned it on

1236
05:23:33,060 --> 05:23:42,090
I think it really depends on distance as well for a lot of people

1237
05:23:42,889 --> 05:23:46,959
Some people I think have it pretty low

1238
05:23:47,639 --> 05:23:52,560
It actually is like three or four seconds for you, but it might be like eight seconds for somebody else, right?

1239
05:23:53,319 --> 05:24:14,590
Probably not even playing is probably going through a whole bag of corn nuts

1240
05:24:16,159 --> 05:24:43,520
These things are annoying

1241
05:24:43,520 --> 05:24:46,560
Thankfully, I will probably never get hit by a projectile ever again. Oh

1242
05:24:57,069 --> 05:24:59,069
I'm sorry. I freaked out cuz I forgot that the

1243
05:24:59,790 --> 05:25:04,549
I'm sorry. I let me let me let me just get my sparrings here for a second

1244
05:25:05,069 --> 05:25:10,849
The hearts are disappearing and I forgot that that was part of that item and I just like was like what the fuck's happening

1245
05:25:11,290 --> 05:25:22,619
What he leads her in this room?

1246
05:25:23,060 --> 05:25:29,049
Get out of my I'm so mad. We'll get out of the fucking way. What the hell?

1247
05:25:29,650 --> 05:25:34,500
It's like every enemy that spawns was an elite and that those two big fat guys just blocking my way

1248
05:25:34,860 --> 05:25:39,360
It was like seven it was six elites in the room

1249
05:25:40,119 --> 05:25:47,740
Last one. I forgot how much greedier was just like a fucking painful

1250
05:25:48,240 --> 05:25:54,830
You can't kill those mother. Oh

1251
05:25:55,310 --> 05:26:48,130
All right, last one nice my question mark. I'm trying to build up my damage lucky. Okay, that's it Max, right?

1252
05:26:48,130 --> 05:27:49,330
Yeah, Northern Lion collab when I mean, I don't know. I wasn't lines really cool, dude

1253
05:27:50,860 --> 05:27:58,790
The way that I feel about collabs like you guys know just whatever like sometimes it just like happens. Sometimes it doesn't sometimes it does I

1254
05:27:59,189 --> 05:28:11,200
Would play something with no in line hundred percent. All right

1255
05:28:12,319 --> 05:28:29,840
Remember do you have an agent? I do have an agency. Yes, I am under evolved. I have an agent

1256
05:28:29,840 --> 05:28:49,909
I have a manager. I don't really talk too much about them or about it. But yes, I do do that damage. No

1257
05:28:50,549 --> 05:29:06,669
All right. Let's try really hard. I just absolutely

1258
05:29:07,669 --> 05:29:16,880
Dissolve that person. All right, don't go in it. What do we got the stew is it's just gonna make me lose

1259
05:29:16,919 --> 05:29:38,200
I think what about an army of lawyers? I do have lawyers. I do I take the stew just go fast

1260
05:29:38,439 --> 05:30:02,080
Okay, but let me get everything else. I need to heart or a key. I'll be full health, right?

1261
05:30:02,080 --> 05:30:07,900
I think it's full health because I'll be able to get when I steamroll everybody

1262
05:30:07,900 --> 05:30:26,130
I freaked out cuz I saw the chest this worst thing to start with. Come on, man

1263
05:30:26,450 --> 05:31:48,740
Only I had tears up so much better timers going up though. This is a good thing. Okay. Oh nice. Nice. Nice

1264
05:31:48,860 --> 05:31:59,619
What is this picking up soul heart grants a random permanent stat? Oh, yep hurry I

1265
05:32:00,659 --> 05:32:05,119
What is that? What is this? What is this? I'm gonna pause it. What is that on the corner that thing? What is that?

1266
05:32:05,319 --> 05:32:17,060
I've never seen that before. It does nothing for you. Okay, it's a holy version of the devil, baby

1267
05:32:18,509 --> 05:32:20,509
Okay, it's not worth it. Okay

1268
05:32:20,790 --> 05:32:23,290
I'm gonna just go buy stuff very fast

1269
05:32:24,680 --> 05:32:26,979
Key, this is a

1270
05:32:28,459 --> 05:32:34,580
Wait, there's a free key. Let's not buy one. Um, what do I buy? What do I buy?

1271
05:32:34,580 --> 05:32:46,540
What do I buy? What do I buy? What do I buy? Go quick. Hurry. What is that? I don't know all stats up. Oh

1272
05:32:47,259 --> 05:32:53,529
Don't shit the Sun two flubs

1273
05:32:54,049 --> 05:33:01,189
The Joker. Um, take a couple of hearts. It's mommy something good. Alright, fuck off

1274
05:33:02,659 --> 05:33:16,069
Joker no, I didn't mean to cool nice panic equals power. I don't know what that just does. Does it do oops

1275
05:33:16,069 --> 05:33:20,139
I didn't I honestly did not press that fucking button. I swear to God

1276
05:33:20,180 --> 05:33:23,630
Why would you why would I have right like why would I have pressed it?

1277
05:33:23,750 --> 05:33:28,979
They said there's no reason why you would have it was it I leaned it against my fucking thigh

1278
05:33:29,419 --> 05:34:29,889
And it hold on go tinted fucking rock. I can build it up. I can build it back up. Look shit

1279
05:34:30,729 --> 05:34:32,729
Forest fucking enemies to have right now

1280
05:35:02,540 --> 05:35:32,509
Get out of here open open

1281
05:35:41,779 --> 05:35:59,529
Free soul hearts. Oh, yeah, this is awesome. I'm gonna get permanent stat upgrades for this. Oh, yeah

1282
05:36:04,900 --> 05:36:12,459
Um

1283
05:36:12,459 --> 05:36:29,270
Okay, good. I think it's over. Yeah firing a coin tier costs one coin

1284
05:36:29,549 --> 05:36:40,009
Every 20 tears you shoot a coin tear and he's hit with the coin turn into gold

1285
05:36:40,529 --> 05:36:57,810
I'm gonna miss this a lot. I imagine it could be good, but it could be bad. I'll try it

1286
05:36:58,049 --> 05:37:03,799
Why not every 20 shots does it keep track? 1 2 3 4 5

1287
05:37:04,439 --> 05:37:08,060
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

1288
05:37:08,580 --> 05:37:15,560
That wasn't 20. It was 15

1289
05:37:19,520 --> 05:37:21,319
Okay, um

1290
05:37:21,319 --> 05:37:25,459
That soul of Eve

1291
05:37:25,500 --> 05:37:28,459
14 dead bird familiars fly in and attack enemies

1292
05:37:29,139 --> 05:37:38,430
Take that for the greed fight

1293
05:37:38,430 --> 05:37:40,930
Good for final boss. Yeah

1294
05:37:41,169 --> 05:37:44,630
Bad I have to lose the card

1295
05:37:44,630 --> 05:38:02,569
All right, let's go. I have a key still. Yeah. All right, let's go by a soul heart

1296
05:38:04,340 --> 05:38:06,340
Mmm, I want to save the money

1297
05:38:09,419 --> 05:38:11,580
Random coin every two rooms. That's great. Oh

1298
05:38:12,619 --> 05:38:14,099
God damn it

1299
05:38:14,099 --> 05:38:42,349
Go hearts. Oh

1300
05:38:42,630 --> 05:38:58,220
Um, whatever god damn it I I worked there's no way anyone's gonna count that I just hope it hits somebody

1301
05:38:58,979 --> 05:39:37,490
Geez, I might I might be at a net negative right now with that. I'm just losing money

1302
05:39:38,009 --> 05:40:34,930
What's hitting me? Stop? I have the coins to collect of my relationships been fantastic

1303
05:40:34,930 --> 05:40:47,650
You mean like all like all around everything's great. Why are you shooting cuz it's I just do it weird question

1304
05:40:47,650 --> 05:40:57,419
Yeah, whatever. Okay, this is important

1305
05:41:00,580 --> 05:41:26,020
Re-rolls pedestal items, which already already already bought them, but I'll use the soul of Eve though. Oh, no, is it?

1306
05:41:26,020 --> 05:41:49,479
Oh, okay. I don't really want the book but on the random trinket while hell doubles the trinket effect

1307
05:41:49,479 --> 05:42:08,990
Oh, I'm gonna do that. Yeah, nice. Okay has be completely uncharged active item. Stop shooting

1308
05:42:19,040 --> 05:42:26,830
Duplicates one pickup in the room d100. No, I don't want that

1309
05:42:27,029 --> 05:42:40,279
Doesn't this double while hell doubles trinket effects shouldn't this be I shouldn't have more

1310
05:42:40,759 --> 05:42:55,340
On the bulb, right? Yeah, but d6 to be honest d100

1311
05:42:55,340 --> 05:43:04,520
Let's gamble this shit use the d100 in this room. That's so bad

1312
05:43:07,540 --> 05:43:28,529
D100 will give you infinite coins. Yeah, it restarts the room time to break the game use it in the shop

1313
05:43:28,529 --> 05:43:42,490
I'll see you guys later. This is nice hanging out with you

1314
05:43:44,319 --> 05:43:52,880
To

1315
05:43:53,479 --> 05:43:55,720
Bismol this is a

1316
05:43:55,720 --> 05:44:10,290
Bismol I don't want that. Okay, so we got the backpack

1317
05:44:14,889 --> 05:44:24,880
extra active item two trinkets worm

1318
05:44:25,240 --> 05:44:45,029
Trap door and then this thing extension cord. I have way I have familiars. Whoa

1319
05:44:45,549 --> 05:44:51,139
This is actually pretty cool. Is it worth it to have this and just kind of run around and hope I kill stuff

1320
05:44:51,139 --> 05:44:59,900
I mean the stat increases much more important. He will literally do anything you tell him

1321
05:44:59,900 --> 05:45:10,459
Well, I mean it is like three o'clock in the morning here, I think I'm a little more I'd say relaxed

1322
05:45:10,459 --> 05:45:33,900
I'll keep them both. Well, might as well do it again, but doesn't really roll the room with some damage up

1323
05:45:33,900 --> 05:45:43,240
This is actually not terrible, but I need damage up before it's over. I mean it might even be over right now

1324
05:45:43,520 --> 05:46:20,720
Yeah, hey EU. Good morning EU. We're having a good breakfast. What are you got? What's it? What's a European breakfast like cigarettes and toast?

1325
05:46:20,720 --> 05:46:34,790
Did I just read that wrong?

1326
05:46:34,950 --> 05:46:39,319
Soy milk is so bad. I don't think is this even soy milk?

1327
05:46:39,319 --> 05:46:46,720
I think so milk is even faster than soy milk is great too, isn't it?

1328
05:46:47,240 --> 05:47:20,450
Sad. Oh, it's not like the build I had before was really fantastic. It was okay. I'm gonna lose I'm gonna lose

1329
05:47:21,049 --> 05:47:25,189
To the fucking Larry whatever Larry jr. 2.0

1330
05:47:25,849 --> 05:47:55,349
God really? Thank God. What can I do to save this divorce papers?

1331
05:47:55,349 --> 05:48:10,790
No, this stuff is even worse. That's the red poop with half a heart to get full HP. Oh, yeah

1332
05:48:10,790 --> 05:48:21,669
I forgot about that bomb reroll use the d100 again

1333
05:48:21,669 --> 05:48:36,009
Um, there's no battery pack reroll for a battery and then

1334
05:48:36,569 --> 05:49:01,529
The whole thing. All right, fine. That's actually a smart idea. Damn it. No batteries damage up

1335
05:49:01,529 --> 05:49:21,540
Wait on the machine. Well now I can't reroll it again. Well, I was gonna run out of money. What just happened to me

1336
05:49:21,540 --> 05:49:28,599
All right. I have an idea. Here's my idea

1337
05:49:28,759 --> 05:49:44,700
I'm gonna get to greed and I'm gonna use I'm gonna get to greed and I'm gonna use the

1338
05:49:45,180 --> 05:49:59,400
Shit on the ground and just teleport out put that in the war spot. What is he doing? What are they doing?

1339
05:49:59,720 --> 05:50:19,540
Use the shovel now. Um shovel doesn't do anything at greed. Uh

1340
05:50:20,099 --> 05:50:36,490
You shovel on gems. Yeah, it'll spawn if I put it. Okay, let's see what happens. Nice

1341
05:50:38,060 --> 05:50:48,340
Only friend this may have just saved everything because I can just go like this and fucking move up and down and just scan

1342
05:50:48,340 --> 05:50:59,209
I'm like a goddamn fax machine. You know what i'm saying? Just go like this and just go

1343
05:51:03,139 --> 05:51:38,099
I hate this i'm gonna heal. I didn't realize that that was stem cells. Well, might as well go all in holy shit

1344
05:51:38,099 --> 05:51:45,700
This is cracked out. This is actually insane. This could have actually saved everything. I'm okay. Relax

1345
05:51:46,020 --> 05:52:06,119
Is it cracked out? Why was it doing? No, never mind. Yeah, never mind. What was doing that much damage this thing here then?

1346
05:52:06,279 --> 05:52:16,869
Yeah contact damage from this. It's amazing

1347
05:52:25,500 --> 05:52:30,979
Hmm out of my way

1348
05:52:31,060 --> 05:52:34,659
Not bad. Yeah, not that great. Whatever. It's all right. I'm just i'm just playing for fun

1349
05:52:34,659 --> 05:52:51,830
Anyways, it's not like a cure that that that that that that that that much random direction

1350
05:52:53,380 --> 05:52:55,459
And then one bone heart three red hearts

1351
05:52:58,939 --> 05:53:00,619
Oh

1352
05:53:00,619 --> 05:53:16,229
Back in action. Do I have anything that does this?

1353
05:53:21,400 --> 05:53:30,729
homing shots to all familiars do the d100 again, I will after this

1354
05:53:31,450 --> 05:53:45,220
I'll let me i'll do this. This is such a mess

1355
05:53:46,619 --> 05:53:52,419
I don't even I I don't even know where i'm shooting. It seems to be working

1356
05:54:04,150 --> 05:54:22,979
Not bad. Actually, i'm not rerolling this. This actually is kind of good. This could be going way worse and you all know it

1357
05:54:23,139 --> 05:54:29,159
Fuck up range down. Who cares?

1358
05:54:33,080 --> 05:54:35,880
Tower wait, what's this? What's the improved tower do?

1359
05:54:36,439 --> 05:54:42,500
It spawns six clusters of random rocks and obstacles

1360
05:54:43,139 --> 05:54:47,669
That's pretty cool

1361
05:54:47,669 --> 05:54:55,959
Holy shit

1362
05:54:55,959 --> 05:54:57,959
Um, no tinted rocks though, right?

1363
05:55:04,889 --> 05:55:22,139
none

1364
05:55:22,139 --> 05:55:25,909
uh

1365
05:55:25,909 --> 05:55:27,509
How is he still alive?

1366
05:55:37,560 --> 05:55:39,740
Do these stupid floating heads?

1367
05:55:39,740 --> 05:55:45,290
Why are they still here?

1368
05:55:45,290 --> 05:55:47,209
This build sucks

1369
05:55:47,209 --> 05:55:48,970
Well, I didn't make this build on my own

1370
05:55:48,970 --> 05:55:56,549
I listened to one person that told me to reroll every single object. Wait, this is gonna is it? Hold on

1371
05:55:57,430 --> 05:55:59,750
But this it's kind of working

1372
05:56:22,549 --> 05:56:24,549
What the fuck was that?

1373
05:56:25,459 --> 05:56:27,459
What just came out of my eyes?

1374
05:56:28,680 --> 05:56:36,259
Ow, dude, I the text on the screen is making it hard to see

1375
05:56:42,040 --> 05:56:45,000
What the fuck is happening? Oh my god

1376
05:56:46,360 --> 05:57:17,560
Dude, can we please charge bar? Hold on a minute. What is going on? Is that 1.8 damage or is it good?

1377
05:57:17,880 --> 05:57:31,740
I don't want to do that. I mean i'm rerolling this shit. I'll take that give me all stats up

1378
05:57:31,979 --> 05:57:50,279
So confused right now, but whatever it's all good. I'm going to use this right now

1379
05:57:53,540 --> 05:58:44,229
Nice 2.6. Oh the knife the knife hurts a lot. Not really. Yeah, this thing's stinging and anything save this

1380
05:58:47,369 --> 05:58:58,580
I imagine not really dude. Do you know what actually could actually save this?

1381
05:59:04,169 --> 05:59:10,409
The just the dead birds and just avoiding greed the whole time just running away and dodging and they'll just kill them

1382
05:59:11,540 --> 05:59:40,409
That's the plan. Let's go. I can't take two. Wait, I can do this though one guy. That's a good item

1383
05:59:40,409 --> 05:59:42,729
But it's how is it gonna not gonna shoot at anything?

1384
05:59:45,220 --> 05:59:48,939
Okay, cool. I'm ready

1385
05:59:50,810 --> 05:59:55,290
I've got my soul of eve. I just have to make it through the next area which good

1386
05:59:56,090 --> 06:00:00,680
That's not bad either. But what is it gonna poison?

1387
06:00:02,299 --> 06:00:37,430
Whatever. Let's go

1388
06:00:37,430 --> 06:00:42,069
That's kind of funny because I get I I might just will I be able to reroll during greed like end time

1389
06:00:42,310 --> 06:00:55,369
All right. Wish me luck. I have no damage. I literally do nothing. It's gonna be impossible, but whatever

1390
06:01:14,869 --> 06:01:21,270
22 damage. I have 22 damage now. Oh, everybody relax everybody relax. I have a shitload of damage now

1391
06:01:28,919 --> 06:01:32,279
22 damage

1392
06:01:32,279 --> 06:01:35,159
All right. All right. All right. I think I did it. I think i'm good

1393
06:01:35,560 --> 06:01:39,319
I don't even know what I have what items these are but this could be this could be legit

1394
06:01:43,770 --> 06:01:46,810
The shot speed is so slow. Look at this

1395
06:01:47,689 --> 06:01:49,689
My tears are so low

1396
06:01:49,930 --> 06:01:53,700
What else is alive?

1397
06:01:53,700 --> 06:02:24,860
Something else alive?

1398
06:02:24,860 --> 06:02:29,290
Get out of my way. My goodness

1399
06:02:30,009 --> 06:02:37,619
I think it's spectral tears

1400
06:03:00,279 --> 06:03:21,380
Oh my goodness gracious. Nice lot. Oh

1401
06:03:22,180 --> 06:03:36,250
I already have one of these don't I here size up might as well give me that give me this give me this

1402
06:03:49,770 --> 06:04:00,220
This is huge. This is actually huge. What should I do now bomb reset? Good idea

1403
06:04:18,119 --> 06:04:20,939
Rainworm, okay

1404
06:04:20,939 --> 06:04:40,409
This might actually work. Oh two trinkets. All right. Yeah, I I think i'm good

1405
06:04:40,569 --> 06:04:47,740
I just have to be careful during ultra greed just hope that the birds can help kill him too and it should be good to go

1406
06:04:47,900 --> 06:05:08,759
Please shit. Thanks

1407
06:05:08,759 --> 06:06:15,180
Jesus stop spawning shit. Fuck off. Come on. This is like this jerk

1408
06:06:15,740 --> 06:06:22,569
Come on, do the 90 degree turn thing that you're supposed to be doing

1409
06:06:23,130 --> 06:06:35,209
How come you're not showing your items? Uh, because strange snipers. I wanted to see what I have

1410
06:06:58,060 --> 06:07:12,060
So this is like kind of crazy, right? Bones of random pickup

1411
06:07:12,540 --> 06:07:34,009
This is a pogged item damage and tears up. Holy shit. All right, i'm ready. So let's go i'm buying

06:07:41,849 --> 06:07:57,909
First in the poison. Wait, is this should I get this? What does a mom's?

1414
06:07:58,310 --> 06:08:20,099
Stuff do or just go to blue hearts knife and damage take it blue hearts or

1415
06:08:21,590 --> 06:08:29,930
I need the range. Look at look at how bad this is i'm doing it. That's much better

1416
06:08:30,009 --> 06:08:41,189
I feel so much more confident. All right, this is it i'm ready

1417
06:08:41,349 --> 06:08:52,860
It's time and just use this thing every single time every second whenever I can use it just just use it

06:08:53,799 --> 06:09:03,750
Oh shit, wait that with soul of eve. Could I have potentially 30 birds?

1419
06:09:04,069 --> 06:09:34,650
There's a 25 chance that i'll have 30 birds. Let's go. It's time. This is it. This is the this is the one right here

1420
06:09:37,979 --> 06:09:44,310
Take both of them. Oh, no, I don't want that. Let's go drink it in the shop

1421
06:09:44,389 --> 06:09:53,110
All right. I already have two trinkets is poison and um, maybe 30 birds better than this thing

1422
06:09:57,849 --> 06:10:10,580
No, i'm gonna keep the worm. All right, let's go. I'm going what is this?

1423
06:10:10,900 --> 06:10:41,750
Why is there a ladder in here? There's an angel room up here. It costs money. Why does it cost money? Okay

1424
06:10:42,950 --> 06:10:57,479

1428
06:12:07,080 --> 06:12:32,650

06:15:29,240 --> 06:15:32,090
Nice hooray

1431
06:15:32,090 --> 06:15:34,090
Wow, that run was thrown away

1432
06:15:34,700 --> 06:15:44,819
Brought out of the trash thrown away again, and then I got like 40 items. I don't even know what I was getting

1433
06:15:45,139 --> 06:15:56,659
Let's see there's an extra hud like I don't even know carried by d 100

1434
06:15:56,900 --> 06:16:03,590
Well, the d 100 ruined it and then made it better again. Look at all this shit that's around me too

1435
06:16:07,369 --> 06:16:32,340
23 damage, it's pretty good. Very cool. Very cool four coins in ultra grade. Oh my god a moment

1436
06:16:32,659 --> 06:16:40,470
Yeah, that's fun. I think when I played grittier all the time

1437
06:16:40,709 --> 06:16:45,689
I want to say it was like a probably like a 20 or 30 percent win rate

1438
06:16:45,930 --> 06:16:59,779
Grittier actually is a huge pain in the ass unless you something like that happens, honestly, and that's it

1439
06:17:00,099 --> 06:17:23,860
I guess i'm asleep. Oh my god. I had a moment. That was really fun. Thanks for chilling out and dave

1440
06:17:23,860 --> 06:17:25,860
Tell us a bedtime story. No

1441
06:17:35,029 --> 06:17:51,479
Hello eu hope you're doing well. How many people are still up in na?

1442
06:17:53,590 --> 06:17:56,869
I have to imagine that pacific na is probably very tired

1443
06:17:58,099 --> 06:18:00,340
and central and east coast na

1444
06:18:01,459 --> 06:18:06,119

1445
06:18:06,119 --> 06:18:08,630

06:18:08,630 --> 06:18:09,990
Where in na?

1447

6 30 a.m. On the east coast. What did you say six and i read it is eight isaac's a lot of fun

1449
06:18:30,360 --> 06:18:34,389
Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out

1450
06:18:34,389 --> 06:18:38,970
I'll see you guys. I'm not streaming tomorrow. I mean, well technically it is tomorrow

1451
06:18:43,689 --> 06:18:46,729
Let's see what it looks like on thursday friday

1452
06:18:48,470 --> 06:18:50,069
I have a couple of things

1453
06:18:50,069 --> 06:18:52,310
Very important to take care of for grotto beasts

1454
06:18:53,560 --> 06:18:56,520
Because grotto beasts is very very close

1455
06:18:58,840 --> 06:19:01,240
There are a lot of things that still have to be kind of situated

1456
06:19:01,880 --> 06:19:06,580
Because obviously the launch of grotto beasts is

1457
06:19:07,540 --> 06:19:12,810
Very very soon when I made that I made talked about it on the discord

1458
06:19:13,049 --> 06:19:15,209
Talked about a little bit a couple weeks ago three weeks ago or so

1459
06:19:16,009 --> 06:19:18,250
Still trying to shoot for that end of february

1460
06:19:20,419 --> 06:19:21,860
And if it's not

1461
06:19:21,860 --> 06:19:25,380
The end of february then it'll be literally like within a day or two later

1462
06:19:25,939 --> 06:19:28,520
We'll get you a hard date

1463
06:19:28,520 --> 06:19:31,720
Tons of info is going to come out tons of things that we can talk about

1464
06:19:34,569 --> 06:19:38,099
Should be really really fun a lot of time a lot of work went into it

1465
06:19:39,299 --> 06:19:43,139
Um, it's kind of the project that took the place of a

1466
06:19:44,520 --> 06:19:51,180
I guess like an event stream

1467
06:19:51,180 --> 06:19:57,830
No way already. Yeah, but what is the end of february? Well, it's still about six or seven more days

1468
06:19:59,689 --> 06:20:00,889
six more days

1469
06:20:00,889 --> 06:20:05,240
What I also told you guys do that this year

1470
06:20:06,409 --> 06:20:09,419
This year's a lot of

1471
06:20:09,419 --> 06:20:11,180
more of this

1472
06:20:11,180 --> 06:20:14,360
Way more of this

1473
06:20:14,360 --> 06:20:16,759
And this new philosophy that I have for the channel

1474
06:20:19,430 --> 06:20:21,430
I think i've streamed way more

1475
06:20:22,259 --> 06:20:24,419
By just being like, you know what?

1476
06:20:24,419 --> 06:20:29,139
It's eight o'clock at night. Let's go. I'm gonna just do anything. It doesn't matter what it is

1477
06:20:40,490 --> 06:20:42,970
And this is the stuff that makes me happy

1478
06:20:43,700 --> 06:20:52,680
So i'm gonna keep doing it

1479
06:20:52,680 --> 06:20:54,680
That's how gamers should be

1480
06:20:56,819 --> 06:21:00,340
But yeah, thanks for sticking around kind of an impromptu late night stream

1481
06:21:01,400 --> 06:21:03,000
I'll see you guys in a couple days

1482
06:21:03,000 --> 06:21:06,680
Maybe a day or two. I don't know. We'll see. I who knows over the next two days

1483
06:21:06,680 --> 06:21:09,750
If I just might just turn it on again

1484
06:21:09,750 --> 06:21:11,750
Breath of the wild is something I really actually do want to do

1485
06:21:13,029 --> 06:21:16,709
Imagine you'll see that frog detective has to happen before the end of february

1486
06:21:17,349 --> 06:21:19,830
What did I say? I was gonna like delete my twitch channel or something if I don't

1487
06:21:20,389 --> 06:21:24,599
it's like hooper, uh

1488
06:21:25,700 --> 06:21:27,860
Will probably be played within the next six to 12 months

1489
06:21:28,580 --> 06:21:30,580
So yeah, I mean there's lots of things to do

1490
06:21:35,700 --> 06:21:37,529
All right, everybody

1491
06:21:37,529 --> 06:21:46,500
I will see you later

1492
06:21:46,500 --> 06:21:50,389
Take care of yourselves get some sleep if you are still up

1493
06:21:51,900 --> 06:21:53,900
Or you know what do whatever do whatever you want

1494
06:21:54,540 --> 06:21:57,900
You do whatever you feel like it's your life. It's not mine

1495
06:21:58,459 --> 06:22:02,840
I'm not going to tell you what to do with yours exactly how I expect you not to tell me what to do with mine

1496
06:22:03,080 --> 06:22:09,479
Just take care of yourself

1497
06:22:09,479 --> 06:22:11,770
Have a great one

1498
06:22:11,770 --> 06:22:17,060
And definitely look out for grotto beast info. It's gonna be a big deal. That's all i'm saying

1499
06:22:18,250 --> 06:22:21,959
Some of the stuff we got cooking

1500
06:22:21,959 --> 06:22:25,580
Just it's I cannot wait for you to see it. That's all i'm gonna say

1501
06:22:47,209 --> 06:22:50,169
We're never gonna see him again. I just I told you i'll be back in like two days

1502
06:22:50,490 --> 06:23:03,880
Hey, my mother wants more info. When can we expect sorcery?

1503
06:23:05,849 --> 06:23:10,549
Uh, she said she has no faith in your wait a little longer excuse

1504
06:23:14,439 --> 06:23:15,159
Yeah

1505
06:23:15,159 --> 06:23:17,779
No, that's a mother. All right. Yep

1506
06:23:19,259 --> 06:23:23,720
That's a mother

1507
06:23:23,720 --> 06:23:27,189
After breath of the wild, I think I want to finish that first

1508
06:23:27,750 --> 06:23:45,139
Yeah, I still want to do the hitman stuff

1509
06:23:45,139 --> 06:23:51,459
I finished sorcery three times in a row after seeing you play it. That's awesome because it's

1510
06:23:52,180 --> 06:24:02,419
One of the best games ever made

1511
06:24:02,419 --> 06:24:05,500
Any new weird dreams?

1512
06:24:05,500 --> 06:24:07,459
um

1513
06:24:07,459 --> 06:24:09,619
Not that I can really recall that were that interesting

1514
06:24:10,099 --> 06:24:16,569
Hold on. Let me just manually turn this down

1515
06:24:16,889 --> 06:24:30,540
There we go. Nice and slow. There it is. Good night guys. Be good

1516
06:24:31,180 --> 06:24:32,299
Be well

1517
06:24:32,299 --> 06:24:40,869
See you soon

1518
06:24:40,869 --> 06:24:42,869
Have a great morning

1519
06:24:42,869 --> 06:24:45,369
Good morning, not good night

1520
06:24:45,369 --> 06:24:46,650
I got it wrong

1521
06:24:46,650 --> 06:24:50,919
See you later

1522
06:24:50,919 --> 06:24:52,439
Call your mother

1523
06:24:52,439 --> 06:24:53,880
Not right now

1524
06:24:53,880 --> 06:24:57,659
In a more reasonable hour

1525
06:24:57,659 --> 06:25:01,939
See you later
