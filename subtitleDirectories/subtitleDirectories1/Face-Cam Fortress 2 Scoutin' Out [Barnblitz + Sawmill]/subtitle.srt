00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:21,940
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing on Bonblitz as the Scout! Get that Scout! No! Help me!

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:32,679
Ooh, thank you Harlow. Thank you. Oh wow, cats, cats, cats, cats. That's a lot of different cats. Oh well. Watch out for the Spy!

3
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:45,740
He's still alive. He's probably going to be right here in a second. No, maybe not. Let's go around. Let's go around up top here.

4
00:00:45,740 --> 00:01:04,209
Okay, you're real. You're the real deal. Cool. Let's go! Oh! Oh, get me out of here! Maybe not. Let's go with a Dubb. Dubb Cheeseburger.

5
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:23,069
Who else? Who else? Oh, Heavy? Heavy? Pyro? That guy's going to take mini crits! Goddamn! Oh, good shot. Good shooting, man.

6
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:39,250
We only got to hold this for like four and a half more minutes. Come on, dudes. Server Clearing Sapper. Wow. That's pretty cool. That's a lot of buildings destroyed.

7
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:50,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Medic! Medic! Medic! That guy's going to get the full health kit. Yeah, he is. Oh, you want to go? Oh, you want to do this?

8
00:01:50,349 --> 00:02:04,219
Is that a Spy? No, it's not. Alrighty. Just another couple minutes. Yeah, it's just another couple minutes. Wee! Oh, goodness, they know up here.

9
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:19,159
I could just hang out right here for a second. Cover them in the mad milk. Like this guy right here. Oh, I'm missing. Over and over again.

10
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:33,000
And there's a Heavy. Oh, goodness, Heavy. Oh, my God. That guy was like tracking me like a freaking radar gun. Go.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,639
All right. I'm about to eat this pretzel stick that's been sitting here for at least three weeks. Gross. Why did I do that?

12
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:59,800
I don't know, but this Spy is still here. Yeah, there he is. There he is. Is there an Uber coming in? No, there's not a Spy, though.

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:11,539
Spy? Just... Oh, he's right here. Get out of here. No! No, don't let him get it! I'm going to have to eat another raw pretzel.

14
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:23,610
Come on. Come on, I have faith. I have faith, guys. Come on, get that Heavy. Get him. All right, undercover Spyro. It's up to you, baby.

15
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:39,710
You're going to... Anybody, anybody want to go with the Scout? Grill cheese, baby. Get it before I get hit by the Saw!

16
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh, I thought that was a Spy. Reverting capture, reverting capture. Don't get hit by the damn saw blade.

17
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:58,180
I'm so scared right now. I'm going to get like backstabbed. No, we're good. Let's cap this thing. We got some... Why does it say five?

18
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:11,770
Oh, there we go. You are a Spy. I could tell. Well, capture the point, capture the point. Get it. Yeah, that's not a Spy.

19
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:39,220
That is a Pyro. And that is... I don't know, I can't even tell. Whoa. Whoa. No, you're real, you're real. Shit. Get him.

20
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:59,000
Now run. Run away. Give me the health. Give me that health, too. Oh, hey, you're a Spy. Any other people here? No.

21
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:14,029
No, don't land on the saw. It will kill you. Oh, run. No. We're playing Scout on Sawmill. I need to re-heal.

22
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:23,040
I need to heal. That's got a Mini-Sentry somewhere over there. Don't kill me with that. Oh, hey. Oh, man.

23
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:36,850
Give me this health. It is very important that I get that health. Stay alive. Hey, Spy. Hey, Spy. Hey, Spy.

24
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:53,689
How are you? Don't get hit by the blade. It's all about dodging these blades. Oh, my God. I thought that was...

25
00:05:53,689 --> 00:06:06,279
I thought that was the saw blade. That just was like a scare moment right there. I feel like I just got hit by a car.

26
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:21,779
Let's go. Don't let them get it. Don't let them get it. We got this. We got this. Make our way out here.

27
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:30,480
Kill this Scout. Kill this Demo. Get hit from behind by God knows what. A soldier with the original.

28
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:52,709
Only one more minute. We got it. 33 seconds. Come on, folks. Come on, folks. Spray. No, I did my second jump already.

29
00:06:52,709 --> 00:07:03,699
What? What are you doing up there, man? I'm going to kill this guy up here. Come on. Come here, you.

30
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:19,139
Are we going to win? I hope so. Yes, we are. Maybe not. Demoman, please don't kill me, sir.

31
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:27,839
All right, guys. Well, that's going to wrap up Face Game Fortress 2. Thank you so much for watching.

32
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:33,209
I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
