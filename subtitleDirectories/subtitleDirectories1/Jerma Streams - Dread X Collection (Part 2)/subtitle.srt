1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:23,929
Yeah, we'll do Dread X. Alright, what are some must-play games in the Dread X Collection 1?

2
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:36,890
What is the must-play from Dread X 1? Oh my god, I can't even... Can I not even launch this game?

3
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:45,380
Okay, I think I have to go... This is weird. Alright, never mind. Weird. That was weird.

4
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,219
Everyone fears losing their mind.

5
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:56,100
Let me just make sure this is not too loud. Alright, so which one should we do?

6
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,320
There is Don't Go Out, Hand of Doom. We did that one a little bit.

7
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:11,349
Summer Night Outsiders, Rotgut, Pony Factory, Shatter. We did this one. I wasn't fair to this

8
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:42,340
one. I was annoyed at the internet. Do Rotgut, Pony Factory, Summer Night, Rotgut, Pony Factory.

9
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:57,430
Alright, we'll do Pony Factory. Let's go. Does it matter? I should do... Okay, that's fine.

10
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:09,189
That should be fine. I remember these old... No, it's not. I remember these. It used to be... Wait,

11
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:15,750
what happened? Anytime that popped up, it was always like, alright, we're in for a real one.

12
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:36,520
Wait, what? What? Really? Oh, shit. Alright, let's go. Duskdev made this. Oh, shit. Alright,

13
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:43,620
let's do it. Let's do it. Alright, so this is Lights Out, Begin Game. I'll turn the lights off.

14
00:02:43,620 --> 00:03:14,500
Lights are going off. Sure. It's because of Mambians. Here we go. Winston arrived at a solution

15
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,150
to the moral decay of his town. He called out to Hel in a secret candlelit room one evening,

16
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,699
and Hel answered him. The human body could, Hel promised, be twisted, stretched, and broken into

17
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:36,020
a kinder, more... a queen shape? The human heart molded into something less human. Winston's town,

18
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,099
now filled with the cruel and the ignorant, could instead be filled with magic ponies,

19
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,129
if he could provide a factory in which to make them. Winston thought they could be beautiful,

20
00:03:45,129 --> 00:04:06,729
gentle, and good. Yeah, Hel had other plans. I don't think so. No, no, no, no. Okay. WASD.

21
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:58,699
There's no sprint. Pick up. What is this? Oh, God. You actually have to shoot stuff? Locked.

22
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:33,899
Look for the unlocked door to complete each area. This is unlocked. Okay. Hold left mouse to fire

23
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:55,029
the bolt gun. Hard reload. Keep on the lookout for ammo pickups. I'm telling you, I'm the guy that

24
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:01,339
distracts people at the door. I distract people at the door. I'm the, you know, I'm the guy with

25
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:06,740
the glasses. The actor, you know, doesn't zoom in. It says the actor. And it's like a quick few cuts

26
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,939
of me doing things and like distracting people and doing like a magic trick behind them and stuff.

27
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:45,579
I'm not the person that comes in and does this. That was, those are very loud. The amount of

28
00:06:45,579 --> 00:07:50,339
question marks. I don't think a lot of you guys were here earlier. I hear something running. I'm

29
00:07:50,339 --> 00:08:13,939
at almost an ammo, man. What did that say? The game's loud. Um, hold on. Let me help you there.

30
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:35,029
I helped. Can you not see? What the fuck are you talking about? I just reloaded my gun.

31
00:08:36,070 --> 00:09:18,679
That you were not in the hallway before. I have no ammo. I'm dead in one hit. That thing was not

32
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:33,860
here. See? Oh my God. I'm dead. Just kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Whatever. I got him with

33
00:09:33,860 --> 00:10:45,419
every shot. Holy fuck. Okay. I need health right now. Oh my God. There's another enemy type

34
00:10:47,509 --> 00:11:33,820
what is it doing? I think I'm in trouble here. One. Why are you guys saying one? One. Why is

35
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:45,240
every saying one? All right. I'm in a much better position than I was last time. I have 15 shots,

36
00:11:45,240 --> 00:12:37,690
70 health. Here he comes. Okay. Thank God. Is that ammo? That's a lot of ammo, isn't it?

37
00:12:37,690 --> 00:13:28,299
No, it's just tape. It's tape. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm dead. Oh fuck. I'm dead. What do I do?

38
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:42,970
I have no way. I don't have enough ammo. I don't have enough ammo. I have 19 bullets.

39
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:10,330
I can't kill all these people. Oh fuck. All right. That was that was actually pretty scary.

40
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,700
That was fucked up. I can't beat it though. I saw you need to you need to be really in there

41
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:28,500
and you got to get in there and get use your eyes. Okay. That was terrifying. Let's do another one.

42
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:41,450
Which one? Summer night. People saying to play rock out. Some people said summer night too.

43
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:54,570
Somebody else said steam is back up. Let's do. Yeah, let's do rock up and then I'll

44
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:07,159
we'll do a few more of those steam games too. It's bright. Oh my goodness. This

45
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:24,409
looks like the old starting soon screen. Have you seen the trailer for the Morbius game?

46
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:33,240
Yeah, it looks fucking cool. You'll see a rock at the curve of Gano street when you do walk into

47
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:58,580
the woods. I was pissed when they said they were making it a card game though. What's going on?

48
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,659
It's like you you get other cards and you use those cards to level up the other cards.

49
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:18,820
I don't know. I'm not into it. And how are they going to have anybody actually give a shit about

50
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,950
that game? I mean, it's just all different versions of Morbius. There's no other Marvel

51
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:32,940
characters in it. It's like Morbius in a suit. Morbius in a tuxedo. Morbius in his beast form

52
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,149
and stuff. It's just like, why the way? I don't care. There's no other Marvel characters in the

53
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:49,000
game. I don't know if they think that it can sell on its own, but I don't think it can.

54
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,009
All right, I need to find Gano street. Is this I mean, this looks like woods to me.

55
00:16:54,570 --> 00:18:16,019
Are these the woods? Big bank. Okay. It's like an underground dance party. This guy is really high.

56
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:27,539
This guy is high as a kite. If that's the only move you're doing. Okay, so what's the deal?

57
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:54,309
Yeah, like I was sweaty. Really sweaty. Just keep going. It's just it's the freaking peanuts.

58
00:18:55,690 --> 00:20:27,349
All the different Charlie Brown dances. Okay, what am I looking for? Look behind you. Nobody's

59
00:20:27,349 --> 00:21:03,779
following me. Rock got rock got who said that? Did I say that that I said that this guy doesn't

60
00:21:03,779 --> 00:22:08,759
is not very scared. Look behind you. It's a chair. Where's the light coming from? What? I'm here.

61
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:36,490
What is this for? Green mold cake time? Are these? Okay, these are not these are not butterflies.

62
00:22:36,490 --> 00:23:11,099
These are asses. Okay, right. Those are asses. Of course, let's get this shit out of me. Why

63
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:21,140
would you ever come down here? Like, why would you ever do this? Would you ever come down here?

64
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:34,150
Okay, I would come down here. If all right, if we if there was like 50 of us, and 10 of them were

65
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:44,519
20 of them were professional bodybuilders, then yeah, I'm only coming down here with 50 people.

66
00:23:44,519 --> 00:24:06,329
No, 100. You're a chicken. No, I'm only doing this if there's and I'm 10 people's too little,

67
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:12,339
10 people's too little 20 people's too little to for me to be comfortable being down here.

68
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:24,299
There needs to be three, four, five rows of people all walking down this way. Because I mean,

69
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,039
if there is a rot gut, he's a kind of a big scary guy, or like a monster or something.

70
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:34,359
You understand that if he starts grabbing and attacking somebody, 10 people are going to get

71
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:37,880
on top of him and like one of the bodybuilders is going to wrap around and like start choking him

72
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,559
out. Like grabbing him behind like this and fucking holding him like this. Like somebody

73
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,400
going to grab him and choke him. What the fuck was that? Was that the sus guy? What was that?

74
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:59,910
What the hell was that? Was that the sus fucking face? What was that? What I did, I like just caught

75
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:10,039
the end of that. What the fuck just happened? I just saw the sus face. And that was really weird

76
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,319
because I was like pretending to go like this and like, and I let go and I just started seeing

77
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:39,670
things. I'm like, wait, I didn't do that. It was it was some woman. Okay. But you know what I mean?

78
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:51,460
And we're all going to have various weapons, right? Like, like pipes, like tire iron,

79
00:25:51,460 --> 00:26:13,059
regular clothes iron, and you're coming down here with 50 people. And and one person is going to be

80
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:19,049
the electronic specialist. They're going to have a backpack with like 10 cell phones with SIM cards

81
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:25,849
in them and shit. Like like a traveling like communications guy. We're going to we're going

82
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:31,609
to have this guy have a backpack with like 15 SIM cards in it to make sure we have a cell phone

83
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:41,180
signal. And that guy's right in the middle. We keep that guy directly in the middle. So no matter

84
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:50,279
what our electronic specialist can like reach the surface. I don't care if this guy's to walk around

85
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:58,009
with a huge antenna behind him going up almost touching the ceiling. I'm almost at the end.

86
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:13,259
It's gonna be horrible. I just scared myself. What is it? What is it? What is it? What's rotgut?

87
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:39,740
It's gonna blow up. You went the wrong way. No, I didn't. It's gonna be like,

88
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:15,480
what the fuck is happening? It's gonna scream. I'm just warning everybody. It's probably gonna

89
00:28:15,480 --> 00:29:08,440
scream in your face. It's getting closer. It is. Oh shit. Get the fuck out of here. What about what's

90
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:51,019
going on? I'm getting outside. What the hell is going on? What was that? Game crashed. Rotgut.

91
00:29:51,019 --> 00:30:18,359
What happened? What happened? My mouse? I can't look. My mouse is not even on the screen. I can't.

92
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:32,549
I have to like force quit the game. I can't get out of here. You just psyched yourself up.

93
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:42,069
I beat it. Okay. That's kind of cool. What else is on here? Oh, right. I was going to do the some

94
00:30:42,069 --> 00:30:46,150
more of the steam stuff. All right. We'll do the one that everybody wanted me to play. That's

95
00:30:46,150 --> 00:31:04,819
what is it called? The one I had just downloaded. Do Summer Night. Okay. We'll do Summer Night.

96
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,180
Absolutely nothing scary happens in this game. For best results, play in a dark room and wear

97
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:46,650
headphones. Use Alt F4 to leave. Well, that's full of shit. What? What's going on with the moon?

98
00:31:46,650 --> 00:32:26,549
20 points. Yeah, I'm not smoking anything. What's this one called? This is called Summer Night.

99
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:32,009
The Dread X Collection number one. There's like five or six of these. I imagine eventually you'll

100
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:49,000
play them all. Or at least some of them. Or most of them. Whatever. Lovely night. Watch out. Watch

101
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:16,460
out for that guy. Watch out. Watch out. Don't touch the poop. Can I move it? Get out of the way. So

102
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:33,750
what? Just some weird guy comes and like shits on your lawn? Monkey business. Get out of the way.

103
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:56,380
Get out of the way. They're blocking the way. Warm breeze. This thing is going to scream in my

104
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,720
face. I'm telling you. I already know. I know it's gonna scream in my face. It's gonna be like

105
00:34:02,680 --> 00:35:00,940
I'm waiting for it to scream. See? It just did. I got it. I got it. Funny fungus. Hey, stop. Don't

106
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:32,119
even. That is something. I heard a sound. What was that? Can you hear that? Meet me in the park. Can

107
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:55,420
you guys hear it? Is it too low? I can't turn it up. I don't think. It's like a turn it up. Can't. I

108
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:03,179
can't hold on. Next transition. I'll do it. It's gonna hopefully it's not too loud. Don't stop

109
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:23,210
hitting me. If I if I try to get if I alt-tab it's gonna close the whole thing out. All right. Let

110
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:36,230
me try. Come on. Come on. Come on. Can you see? I got it. Nice. It said time flies. You're gonna.

111
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:43,019
Okay. Yeah. Here's the thing. Didn't work. Didn't fucking work. You know why? Because there's no

112
00:36:43,019 --> 00:37:29,210
door over there. Now if that came from over here I would go. Yeah. What's going on with the moon?

113
00:37:29,210 --> 00:38:00,059
Come on. What is that thing? I'm telling you. I'm only doing things with like 50 people. You know

114
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:03,820
what I mean? I'm like anytime I go anywhere it's gonna be a hundred people. We're all gonna like be

115
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:48,500
ready. That's not scary. There's just like a rat in the attic. Nice try. Is there on my webcam?

116
00:38:48,500 --> 00:39:26,219
Ah. That's. I didn't even. I've been holding right here this whole time. The battery is going.

117
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:35,429
My itchy face. The battery's gonna go to zero and some hands gonna come over and grab and pull and

118
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:57,429
it's gonna scream at me. Error. Okay. I don't know what it is but like I feel like a lot of older

119
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:03,429
people jumpscares like don't work. I'm gonna pretend to be like a fucking 70 year old.

120
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:42,250
Whoa. What was that? Holy smokes. Oh he's an ugly one. I tried to punch. I'm trying to put.

121
00:40:42,250 --> 00:41:27,909
Somebody's breathing. How am I supposed to go over there? Why would you punch? I'm telling you. I'm

122
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:35,210
doing. I'm doing a triple crowhop. Like crowhop. Crowhop. Crowhop. Punch as fucking hard as I can.

123
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:42,329
Directly square here. As hard as I possibly can and try to take that fucking head off.

124
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:49,000
We're talking crowhop. Crowhop. Crowhop. Fucking wham. You know what I mean? No not the game.

125
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:15,929
Like the monster. Not the game. What the fuck? Are you kidding me? I knew it was gonna be something

126
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:49,619
weird. Dude how come there ain't 50 people in this house? Huh? Give me the batteries. I did it.

127
00:42:49,619 --> 00:43:13,619
Those batteries were huge. That was creepy. That was creepy. That was a good one. By the way,

128
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:19,690
monster is in my house. I don't fucking. I don't care. I mean that fridge is coming down.

129
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:26,889
I mean like monster in my room. Oh my god. I'm in like the kitchen. Monster's right there.

130
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:32,090
I'm grabbing the fridge and I'm gonna fucking he-man that thing and just like rip it out of the

131
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:38,059
fucking wall and just toss it down and smash it down and shit. I'm grabbing every kitchen knife

132
00:43:38,059 --> 00:43:44,860
like. I'm grabbing the frying pan. That's over there. You over there. You're getting a fucking

The vacuum cleaner. Oh my god. I'm holding the vacuum cleaner the other way.

140
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,420
Like a joke weapon from fucking Dead Rising. And this is. I'm baseball swinging the vacuum

141
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,500
into their head. I'm telling you what would happen. I'm telling you what would happen.

crabbing backwards at you. All right. That's a really bad position to be in. I'm going to.

144
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,940
I'm fucking macho man. Randy Savage. Elbow dropping you right in the fucking stomach.

145
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:32,809
I'm running up and I'm going to fucking just right in the middle. What a terrible position

146
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:43,449
for you to be in. They're getting the people's elbow. Or vacuum cleaner. Just get it ready.

147
00:45:43,449 --> 00:46:01,610
Up. Down. You would get eaten. There's no way I'm getting eaten. What happened to my webcam?

148
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,119
No. There's no way I'm getting eaten. Oh you think I'm going to get eaten?

149
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Into the freezer. All the frozen food is coming out. And I'm taking it out of the

150
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,320
package and throwing it out. I'm going in the fridge. All the raw meat is just like

151
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:23,739
getting thrown out in front. Every piece of food that I have. It's going to be like meat.

152
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:28,699
It's going to go for it. And that's when you go fucking. Right. Oh my God. That was probably

153
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:57,159
so loud. How sweaty I am. Was that loud? Okay. Okay. Thank God. Dude. Just keep like big boots up

154
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:07,239

155
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,519

156
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:22,980

158
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:44,489
two sizes too big. Two sizes too big. What am I talking about? I'm talking about if a monster

159
00:47:44,489 --> 00:48:06,380
were to. Horror movie style be in my house. Normal shoes. What if it was a dinosaur?

160
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:17,260
What are you talking about? A dinosaur is an old animal. Why would it be a. If it's a dinosaur

161
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:27,030
then. Okay. Then that's a. I guess I'm dead. Oh no. No. I would. No. What I would do.

162
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:33,110
Excuse me. I would take the standing lamp that's in the living room. I would take.

163
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:39,909
Unscrew the light out of the standing lamp. Take the lampshade off and have a javelin and just throw

164
00:48:39,909 --> 00:49:10,250
it. Like right into the fucking dinosaur's heart. You know what I mean? Like. Do you really think

165
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:23,670
you are special enough for a monster to come after you? I don't know. He's going off the record.

166
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:36,599
What do you mean off the record? No. If a dinosaur came to the house. I would just go out. I would

167
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,239
just go. I would. I would meet the dinosaur outside. And I would go like this. Be huge. I'm

168
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,989
much. I'm huge. I'm much bigger than you. Like this. My arms would be in the air. And I'd be

169
00:49:45,989 --> 00:50:07,829
going like this. Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. It would work. Imagine what. I'm just

170
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:14,309
seeing like a clip from a movie in my head. I'm out there like go away. Go away. Go away. And it's

171
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:28,860
just. I'm the first to die in the movie. I the first to go. That's the opening scene of the movie.

172
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,679
All right. Anyways.
