1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,870
Okay, you've got it. You're doing it. You must have clicked single player last time. All right

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:13,179
Well, it's it looks like something it's being weird. Okay, it should be downloading the mods right now

3
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:26,239
I guess it is my downloading it from you. Yeah, I assume just a chat the way it'll be worth it

4
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,929
We're talking Terraria

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,450
Right now I got a bar on my screen. That doesn't have any a list of anything on it. It's just like an empty bar

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,609
Just trust the bar. Okay, just don't do I'm just saying does this happen to you?

7
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,710
Like do you have like a no text on it? The bars are sitting there nothing downloading. Well last time

8
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,609
Me and Ashley played we both

9
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,929
like individually downloaded the mods

10
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,969
So why didn't you just tell me to download the mods?

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,229
Because this should be easier and I wanted to reduce the amount of pain that you would be caused like

12
00:00:57,369 --> 00:01:00,969
You know

13
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:05,319
It should just download

14
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,319
It should I guess

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,719

We need to gear up and prepare for our first boss fight German first boss fight

00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,860
Progression. It's like fighting in Dariel or the cook. Okay

56
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:32,410

57
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:39,639
Should I be like mining stone block sure

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:52,319
Can feel this in my teeth? That's how loud it is

61
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,319

62
00:04:54,519 --> 00:05:02,740
That's better. Yeah, but yeah guys are doing terraria today. This is just kind of a stars like yo, let's play terraria

63
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,899
I'm like, all right, you're my husband left what?

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,360
Germa has left. Oh, it's really awesome

65
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,319
This is probably the best dream. I have ever had

66
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,160
I don't that

67
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,009
My look my internet's fine. Everything's fine

68
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,910
And rejoin I'm coming in right now

69
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:33,800
Dude, this is so scuffed, bro

70
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,040
All right

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,339
That was weird. Maybe it's give us was I like all tabbed for a second. Maybe that's maybe can you not all tab in this game?

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,370
You should be fine

73
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, so give me some like the general

74
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,189
Control stuff

75
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:59,350
General control stuff is just escape to open up that and you have the one through numbers

76
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:06,670
Yeah to hotkey whatever you have put up there, I would recommend to have torches up there. So how do I mean how do you make torches?

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,629
I'll give you some I have copper coins. Okay, so just hotkey torches

78
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,850
Just put them up in like four or something or is where I put them store brothers now. Okay

79
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,490
You got some weapons, you know, put them up there. There's also an auto sort inventory

80
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:28,110
The bottom of your inventory the bottom right is your trash can where you delete items

81
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,589
And the box next the next to that you should have you have to enable

82
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,889
Auto trash so if you put something in that trash can every time you pick it up from now on it will automatically get trashed

83
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,589
Okay, so it's which will save your life later. Okay, so like if I let's say if I put stone block in there

84
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:50,550
It'll just always delete stone block. Yeah, but you don't want to delete stone blocks right now. How do I place?

85
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,949
Yeah, everything just goes into the hotkey system

86
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,910
So if you have it, you know stone blocks on for then you're placing it

87
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,670
All right. You should have we should we wait till daytime or should we keep go down and look for some like treasurer?

88
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,069
Let's chop some trees. We're gonna need a lot of wood

89
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:19,980
No, but you're gonna have to join the red team again turn the red team, okay, it like shows us where we are

90
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,180
Did I do it? Yeah

91
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,360
The flying demon eyes have you ever played this game like ever

92
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,160
No, no, not really. I think I've opened it like a few times randomly and then it just that's it

93
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,279
Are gonna be stir sucks Terraria Jerma Saturdays

94
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,160
Don't say that what if this is gonna take over your life

95
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,649
Okay, so also when you press escape you see on the left-hand side. You have a bunch of options

96
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,529
Crafting down here. Yeah, so wood platforms are very important

97
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,529
You hold down right-click to make a bunch. You're just turning wood into wood platforms. It shows you the rest of the shit

98
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:03,670
Okay, and then it's these that you place down so you can like fall through these but also do they have to be an atom

99
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,170
What can I just make them like in here?

100
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:12,069
They have to be connected to something or if there's a back wall you can place it on a back wall

101
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,649
So I made it really I really did not know you didn't know anything

102
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,649
I thought you had like a base. No, I mean I just I knew it was you craft

103
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:23,649
Well, I just made like a hundred of the other day. Oh, I

00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,159
Okay, I couldn't okay good I'll take them I'll take the

160
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:35,100
Should we go down down no, this is not a game we use we go down

161
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,200
It is a game where you go down, but not yet. Not yet. Do zoomed out mode is best. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna train my eyes

162
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,559
The more comfortable I get inside the game. I will zoom out a little

163
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,419
There are bosses that are gonna kill you for being zoomed in

164
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,990
Just know let him play at his own pace. Okay

165
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,429
Thanks, just let him relax. This is less minecraft more Dark Souls

166
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:15,879
Okay, he's not bored enough yet to do the I fell in that whole joke. That's a good sign. No, I

167
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,960
It's been enough. It's been enough time. Okay. No, what is this is gold a

168
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,139
tin

169
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,659
Just follow me

170
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:28,379
I want it. I'm gonna stop every time you see some fucking tin

171
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:32,590
Maybe is it worth getting?

172
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:43,200
Zoom the UI too. Wait, that's true. I can do that. I can zoom in the UI

173
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:56,789
Here here's uh, here's some potions. Whoops. I drank it drank potions. Okay, it was an accident

174
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:05,029
I can heal you now where everything is everything is great

175
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:12,720
Okay, that's a little better. I'm just playing the iPad version the one that has everything bigger. Oh check this out

176
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,759
Here's a here's a tutorial moment. So you have your pickaxe and obviously you're gonna click these little walls, right? Yeah

177
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,100
You press alt and you see how it there's a yellow marker

178
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,919
alt

179
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,919
You should press all at one time

180
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,139
I did like yellow block. Okay, so just aim forward and like put your mouse the left side of the screen

181
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,259
Yes, and then when you hold left click, it'll auto dig you forward

182
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,139
So you don't have to individually click each block, but you still have to like walk forward

183
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,259
I'm not getting the yellow thing. You're describing press alt again. It's controlled by the way

184
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,820
Is it default? Oh, I don't know. Whoops. Sorry. Guess don't listen to me again

185
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,379
Now look we're working together why is the last two games we played together mining games

186
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,980
And you notice that watch out behind us

187
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,009
We played that deep rock galactic. Oh, no, we played

188
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:23,279
Well, we kind of did it you you like disappeared you looked at the painting for too long

189
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:33,259
All right, let's go. I got tin

190
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm fucking so we look at our desert. You want to do this?

191
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,200
This is iron there's something led same thing. All right, you just murdered that squirrel

192
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:55,399
So lead dirt was a lead stone, so what what's the what's the hierarchy here? What's what's like the the tier list for wars?

193
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,799
What's 10 on that?

194
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,200
The tier list for oars is we probably really only need lead

195
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,660
Here's the desert was 10 on that one 10 is 10 is non-existent. Oh

196
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,910
It does a thing to your screen to it, doesn't it?

197
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,680
Okay, Jerma, this is our new home. This is we're gonna live we're gonna live. Hey, we're already used to that

198
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,960
All right. Here's what here's what you're gonna do. Help me

199
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,099
Flatten this ground. All right, so just with the flat it out

200
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:35,789
Flatten it out because we need to build a home because in Terraria when you have homes people show up

201
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,579
uninvited on

202
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:43,140
Uninvited but they're very important NPCs. Should I fill this hole?

203
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:49,619
Sure, you know, just make it look nice, you know users some of your creativity. Okay

204
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:53,589
It's dirt right was it sand

205
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,950
Sand there's a giant hornet over here. I kind of that scared the shit out of me. Help me

206
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:13,859
Whoa, all right, that's cool. What now it's all dirty. We have to move somewhere

207
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,779
Okay goes away, how are you throwing these knives that's so cool

208
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:29,069
Let me get dirt in here

209
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:42,390
So, how do you just this is not dirt? How do I take it back? I put it back in my inventory

210
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,250
You should auto be. Oh, yeah, just delete it again

211
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:57,700
Okay, sand block sand block sand block. All right. So now I can I just fill this

212
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
How far how big do you want the house?

213
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,559
way too big

214
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,440
We're eventually we're going to be like a metropolis

215
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,640
What?

216
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,430
It's gonna be big. It's gotta be big German. Yeah, this is the most boring bar to Terraria and you need to get it done quick

217
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,240
So from you to me, that's not big enough

218
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:29,769
It'll do for now. It's like in real life. If this was scaled. This would be like a this would be like a 2500 square foot house

219
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,049
It's not big enough

220
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,369
For now

221
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,369
For now, there we go

222
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:48,220
So you I'll lay the foundation down to here's just like I have to do this and I don't know what to tell you

223
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,420
To do a while. I'm doing it, you know, what about that slime? I'll get it

224
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:06,089
Got it you got it. Where's my wood? Where is your wood wood right here?

225
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,730
All right, so I'm gonna do

226
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,490
What about watch up your little yeah, I want you a little guy to get hurt. Do I need wooden block? Oh

227
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,779
Another hornet. You can't get in though

228
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,700
We're protected

229
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,619
Okay, we're building slave encampments, by the way, I hope you're okay with that

230
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:44,319
Just control again turn off auto mine. Oh, yeah, you have to press control control also auto places blocks. Oh

231
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,509
Alright, so how do you want to do this?

232
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:53,710
But I want to do one. Did you just say we were doing what you just what are we doing? What are we building here?

233
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,710
Oh, I'm let me let me do one. Let me just do one watch over this is chicken

234
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,509
There's ignore the chicken Jerma stay focused there's too many enemies to look at

235
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,339
You get too many flavors. I've never had blueberry turkey before

236
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,420
Yeah, you do might need to get more wood. You know what? I'm sending you on a fucking wood errand run

237
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,619
You got it. Well, tell me what to do. Here. Hold on. You don't get wood

238

No tools, no, okay

242

That would be a bad game

243
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:40,589
What it yeah?

244
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,950
Unanimously if your tools degrade it and if every single time link swung his sword it broke that would be a bad game

245
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,650
You need to not use that weapon

246
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,450
It's that bad

247
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,599
How many times can I fire this? Okay, German German German German. Oh wait. No, you can't do that yet. Come on

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,460
You bring me the candy canes i'll make you a candy cane room

263
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,259
Really role play in this little brother role very very

264
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,339
intensely

265
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:11,579
There's like a big pig over here, too

266
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:22,460
I'm almost at a man. Oh

267
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
I am at a man. Oh

268
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,339
Do you get there's like exp in this game, right?

269
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,019
God damn it, dude

270
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:37,940
Uh kind of yeah

271
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,579
So should I be making like a stone?

272
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,819
pickaxe or no

273
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,460
No

274
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,109
What do you mean? No

275
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,390
Isn't that how every single one of these games works

276
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,269
Why is hey chat? Why isn't this valid housing? What did I do wrong?

277
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:07,299
Unless something changed that's so big. It's supposed to be 10

278
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,779
How much I got a lot of wood I have is way bigger than a door

279
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,900
Oh, I don't think I have a door on the whole building. That's probably what it is

280
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,519
So give me a number you don't need doors

281
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,180
When can I turn this question to stir the npc over there?

282
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,160
It should tell you what's wrong. Yeah, it's just saying it's not valid

283
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,009
What it is am I wiping out like the whole forest here? Should I be planting seeds?

284
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:48,369
No

285
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:50,700
Fuck nature

286
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,140
No, hey

287
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,769
I feel like I should be planning stuff

288
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:03,420
so

289
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:10,299
Hey guys

291
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,660
No, not really

292
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:20,900
I have done this so many times

293
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,059
And it has never not

294
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,180
been valid housing germa

295
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,500
Do you understand?

296
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,140
How can you all right? There's a super dragon here now like what this is going very well

297
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
How much wood do you want is 252 wood enough?

298
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:39,619
Just keep getting wood. What?

299
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:44,180
No, you're fighting this super dragon and I don't even you're just gonna keep me on the

300
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:50,099
I am one of your like peons in warcraft. You get to play the game. I have to just hit the fucking tree

301
00:25:50,819 --> 00:26:02,779
I'm just gonna make it one bigger. I guess

302
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,819
i'm just waiting for like 25 more of me to show up behind me and hit the uh

303
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,140
Tree with the pickaxe

304
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,579
That always ended up happening that happened to you too, right? Whenever you were playing, uh, like warcraft 2 or warcraft 3

305
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,059
Never that was never me

306
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:27,180
You never just like click and dragged your whole screen and put every single pea on a peasant on cutting trees

307
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:32,460
German you need to come back. I just

308
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,319
I was on the way. You told me no come back come back

309

I have 450 wood if that's not enough and I don't know what is

314
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
People are screaming at me to plant the acorns and you told me no

All right, how do I give stuff like that's what I had it out originally 12. Holy shit. This room sucks

316
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,819

Here take those walls

360
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,059
Those are wood walls. You see how the background is wood

361
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,900
We need to fill this whole place with with wood the whole thing. I want candy cane though

362
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:42,059
Oh my god, we can do the candy cane after all right, so just put these in the back

00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:51,490
Uh, is it okay if I like don't color in the lines?

364
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,250
I didn't know a very long time to remove them. I what what do you mean?

365
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,970
It's it's a pain in the butt

366
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:04,369
Okay, it's like kind of hard to do this

367
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,789
Okay, no control, right?

368
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,500
Uh, yeah, the control thing should auto fill as well

369
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,690
Is that a firework?

370
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,890
Yeah, I leveled up my summoner proficiency

371
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,119
the absolute speed

372
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,569
And the bottom two

373
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:52,289
But everything the whole thing he's muted. He muted himself. Are you still talking to me? I'm just gonna say

374
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:57,250
I'm talking to everyone who's like going crazy mad at me because they think i'm doing something wrong

375
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,269
Oh, you know, I can tell you I i'm in like a great position right now

376
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:09,230
Like this is all you i'm just like building walls and like you like know things if people know things in your chat

377
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:14,109
I just live in your house right now

378
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,069
Like when the toilet breaks in your house, like I don't call the repairman

379
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,430
You do anyone who said I needed a door go fuck yourself

380
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,619
You apologize right now

381
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,869
I'm having a good time

382
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:50,880
It is like

383
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,759
Here i'm missing i'm making these platforms so you can remove that that extra accidental ceiling

384
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,920
What do you mean one up here? You need to pickaxe that ceiling that shouldn't be that way pickaxe of the ceiling

385
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,640
Yeah, remove the wood ceiling. That's there. You understand take out you want me to get rid of like this the ceiling

386
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,640
Like the let the this like the bottom but the wood of yes the bottom part of the butt, right?

387
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,920
This needs to look perfect. Otherwise, no one's gonna want to live here

388
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,349
Now these platforms could be a little better

389
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:27,549
I'm not gonna say anything about what the platforms are being removed. They're just so you can stand on them jerma

390
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,349
It's like a ladder you ever use a ladder before you short

391
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh

392
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
You can say you can say fuck it all

393
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,180
This isn't this isn't uh

394
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,940
Yeah, I was I was as tall as you in that one picture that people refer to

395
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,480
I was like

396
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,559
What about what do I do?

397
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,799
You just wait for me. What? All right. So what what is mysterio doing over here?

398
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,460
What is that stereo?

399
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,460
Holy shit, are you really?

400
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,949
Unbelievable, you want me to get rid of this one too again. What are you gonna die again?

401
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,980
The mod adds these early game robbers with like pistols that just like instant kill you

402
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,420
Put on head or pre-recorded. All right, where's the shoe? Can I put a shoe over head in the game?

403
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,719
Am I safe in here?

404
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,280
Yes, you're safe jerma. Just don't open the door. But I like it's it's like don't press the button and i'm about to

405
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:58,070
Don't press i'm gonna go talk to mysterio. All right, i'll finish this. I would not want to live here. Go talk to mysterio

406
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,510
Uh, we need more walls

407
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:12,639
So we said mine straight. Yeah, can I like just mine straight down?

408
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,519
And have like a little basement thing

409
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:20,460
Um, there's something I want you to do before we do that then then here

410
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:23,019
This is very important before I can set you free. Sure

411
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,739
Can you right click that does it say spawn point set?

412
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,980
No

413
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,380
Uh, if I right click it, it does nothing now

414
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,860
spawn point set

415
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,900
Okay

416
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,900
Now you can dig straight down

417
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,139
dig straight down

418
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:49,099
Is that smart though, or is that just gonna be like a comedy moment? Um, what I would actually recommend doing is once night ends

419
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,460
You know how you can press m and it opens the map. Yeah

420
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,380
There are some tunnels that go down not this desert one. Don't do this one

421
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,539
But like we pass some you can start exploring those caves and if you find chests chests have uh,

422
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:05,019
special items in them

423
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,579
Um what I will also give to you

424
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:11,980
Can you sell stuff in this game or should I just start trying like what what should I not be holding on to?

425
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:16,989
Uh, like random flowers you've picked up are probably useless

426
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,869
How do I sell them? Just do it just trashing them sell

427
00:36:20,909 --> 00:36:24,320
Uh, we need npcs to show up before we can sell things

428
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
Why is clicking this just making it brighter?

429
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:36,059
Oh, never mind

430
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:38,059
Uh, I have a wrath element

431
00:36:40,579 --> 00:36:43,860
Um, should I be holding how do I hold blood in my pockets?

432
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,980
Anything that you're not sure that you need just dump in there just dump all your garbage in that box

433
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,219
Okay, is there a way to dump all?

434
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:53,619
No

435
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,500
Oh well

436
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,340
Gotta keep that tin

437
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,940
Is there like a

438
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,340
Shift click or something to make it so it goes do I don't click and drag?

439
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,690
Okay, there we go

440
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:14,530
blood droplets

441
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,409
Victory shard. Yeah, you're gonna have to sort through this

442
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:30,579
I've never played this really before but I know

443
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,059
For a fact that these seashells should not be put in here

444
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,019
Throw them in there deposit all

445
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
I thought wait, what do you mean deposit all?

446
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:47,539
You just told me I couldn't do deposit all everyone's screaming. Oh

447
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,929
I have but everybody i'm sorry. I wouldn't I didn't say but star was just telling me I couldn't do that

448
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:57,250
I don't think you could because I don't I don't know why you would want to do that because usually you have

449
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,570
Inventory that you need

450
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,570
I I would have I would have taken a look

451
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,429
Okay

452
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:05,550
um

453
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,150
So i'm gonna

454
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,380
You want to go into a cave?

455
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,820
You want to go together?

456
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,980
Okay. Yeah, let's just finish this room

457
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,539
Let me get some stuff

458
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:18,860
Let me redo this. How do you make torches?

459
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:22,289
uh, you need gel and

460
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,329

461
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:25,809
Wood platforms. All right. How many you get gel from the

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,010
Yeah, I got it 33 torches

463
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:31,489
That's good. Okay

464
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:36,769
You'll also find a lot from going down there. Yeah, anything. What about like a better sword or something? How do I get do that?

465
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:39,969
We really don't have any

466
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,019
Anything yet. What about these flaming arrows?

467
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,900
I'm making these, you know, you know what we can go do

468
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:52,219

469
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
All I remember is oh

00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:01,579
All right. I got my candy cane rolls

471
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:06,369
Never mind. I usually just make cobweb stuff. We haven't done. They come left

472
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,329
Here's the play we're gonna get we're gonna get good items fast. You like having good items

473
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:13,969
I guess but I wasn't really ready

474
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:18,820
I got flaming arrows at 10 flaming arrows. I got my magic wand thing

475
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,579
All right

476
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,739
The somebody said there's a funny joke I can do

477
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,420
There's always a funny joke. You can sell everything to calvin

478
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,750
Does that mean anything to you?

479
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:38,369
No

480
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,730
Unless our

481
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,570
The merchant's name

518
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,969

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:59,940

00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,139
Uh, you cannot swim make sure you don't fall down that hole

525
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:06,099
What do you mean? I cannot swim. I made it a concrete

526
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,579
Yeah

527
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:11,019
What really?

528
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:13,900
Yeah, if I would have fallen there, but you fell in

529
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:18,219
Well, yeah, like you can only jump once you've hit the ground. Oh, okay

530
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:27,500
Well, I gotta stop

531
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,710
So why are we going this far away?

532
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,090
Uh, I'm personally personally i'm looking for corruption

533
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,119
Which is a a biome that we're not currently in give me your mouse for a minute. I need to do something

534
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,360
Are they hostile a boar's hostile is now

535
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,880
Cool, all right, they drop bacon, which is good bacon

536
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,199
Yeah, there's one bacon

537
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,230
So what's the first boss?

538
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,230
Well, the first one I want to fight is

539
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:08,710
a giant worm

540
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:11,429
In the desert, which is why we built the desert top epic

541
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,110
I'll see like down here this chest. Yeah, this is what life is all about in terraria, dude

542
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,690
It had like garbage in it here, uh

543
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:27,159
I'm gonna give you a bunch of rope

544
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:30,599
What's your what's your what's your opinion on bacon when I say the word bacon? What do you think of?

545
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,659
Uh, I think of slices of bacon take those potions that are in there

546
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:49,750
And there's that rope. All right, so I technically can just go like

547
00:44:55,030 --> 00:45:00,289
Yeah, that's fun what are these little tanks? All right

548
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,090
Uh, they're little tanks

549
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
Oh, man air shot

550
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, dude food epic, bro

551
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,159
I know right. I yeah, that's a delayed bacon reaction

552
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:24,579
Yeah, okay. This direction sucks

553
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:26,579
It's just desert

554
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:29,860
Desert and yungle

555
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:33,090
Is that a bad thing?

556
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,289
Yeah

557
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:36,289
Looking for corruption, bro

558
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
Is it poisonous or something?

559
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,659
No

560
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:49,119
Oh, that's a cool particle there

561
00:45:49,619 --> 00:46:01,920
What the fuck?

562
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,929
Wait, um, should I not go down there?

563
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,409
You can do it. I believe you need to heal

564
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:14,690
I'm good

565
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:20,900
There's a treasure chest over here. Oh wow treasure chest holly

566
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:24,449
Well, it's a festive holly

567
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:33,199
This is cool

568
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,800
Not the desert anymore

569
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,389
So you I don't think you ever said the person that you wanted to fight

570
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,090
The person we want to fight the first boss big giant desert worm

571
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:55,989
It's a shot like a roman candle. That's all I did

572
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:06,130
People are saying what about the slime man? What about it?

573
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:09,809
Is that the first boss?

574
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,760
How do I get like a little buddy?

575
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,719
How do I heal?

576
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:22,280
H if you have a potion I thought I did

577
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,000
I'll give you some

578
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,309
I guess not

579
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:31,510
Oh, no, I do I do from knocking down trees eat an apple

580
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:39,239
Oh, how do I eat them just by clicking on them use? Yeah, and we use everything only one

581
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,880
Oh only one

582
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,119
I did have a healing potion. Why was it not working?

583
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,800
Uh, there's a healing cooldown. That's pretty long

584
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,599
That shows if your inventory is minimized. There's a healing sickness like

585
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,460
40 seconds something cool down

586
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,960
Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well fed I see

587
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
And a well thought is different

588
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:13,760
I gotta be careful here these little owls. What the hell that your little guy keeps hitting these owls

589
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,159
And then they start to fucking attack me

590
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,039
They're always attacking they are

591
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:20,960
Yeah

592
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,110
Don't blame me

593
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,190
Okay, is it like bees can they go in water?

594
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,369
Um, most things actually can't

595
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,530
No, this thing can't

596
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:43,650
Where if there's no corruption this direction, I'm if you're false

597
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:47,170
How would it be my fault? What do you do with the money the copper?

598
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:54,019
Uh, you can buy things from the npcs in the house as we made. I mean the present is remade

599
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,000
Is it

600
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Is this a slime present?

601
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,420
Why is there something?

602
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,579
They're very generous. Oh, okay. I get it

603
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:12,500
Currency can be exchanged for goods and services

604
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,800
Oh

605
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:25,639
It's tin very helpful

606
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,440
We went really really really far away

607
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,760
Yeah, we did

608
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,760
Are we gonna have to make a new house?

609
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh, I can't even I don't even know where our house is

610
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,309
There's like nothing in this direction

611
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:47,730
Is it you're looking for something very very very specific?

612
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:50,369
It's usually like right next to you

613
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:57,090
Here, you know what you have, uh the blue potion in your indoor recall potion

614
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,969
Yes

615
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:02,369
Yeah, if you use that it will take you to the bed

616
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,250
Oh, that's all right. That's cool

617
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:11,719
I can actually drown in this

618
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,920
Yeah

619
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,949
Get out of the way fucking slimes

00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,110
a cool staff that's

622
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,159
The one you have will be decent for a while. Okay

623
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:38,659
For you for you to get a cool one. We're gonna need to kill a boss

624
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:41,400
Okay

625
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,250
Okay

626
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,409
Settle down you don't have to scream at me

627
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,079
I'm screaming

628
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,079
Are you back at home? No

629
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,960

Yeah, i'm still going in this direction and it's I don't think it's gonna be this way

00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,539
Okay, so you can try and go down the caves and find chests

Whoa, he just came in. I I didn't open it. Oh, oh

00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,349
Where's this hat people are talking about? I don't see a hat

660
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,469
There's a shuriken

661
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:19,199
A mining helmet

662
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,519
Is there a quick way to see how much money I have?

663
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,860
Um

664
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,360
Is it I have one gold

665
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,239
If you're gonna buy anything talk to the demolitionist and buy bombs bombs and dynamite

666
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,579
Get the money when you die you drop money as well. So you might lose it

667
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:47,219
moon glow

668
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:50,260
Why did you sell the wolfram? I don't even know what that is

669
00:53:51,219 --> 00:53:53,380
I I I just it's a piece of glass to me

670
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,719
Don't be afraid to ask, you know, you ask questions. Okay star. What is wolf from shard?

671
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:09,940
Well, it's a very early game item you can craft them into early game armor and they're pretty good. Okay. What is moon glow?

672
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:14,239
moon glow is

673
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,519
Normally used to make potions, but it's not important because we have a potion npc so I wouldn't bother. Okay

674
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,730
What is gel?

675
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:25,730
Gel is the drop from

676
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,329
The jellies and mostly used in torches

677
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,210
A couple other things what's blinkroot?

678
00:54:33,329 --> 00:54:35,650
Also used for potions and not relevant for us

679
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:41,730
What is deathweed seeds?

680
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:48,840
Anything that's like plant-based or seed-based is going to be a potion crafting and does not matter

681
00:54:51,409 --> 00:54:53,730
I'm helping you study for the test with flashcards

682
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:58,289
Okay

683
00:54:58,289 --> 00:55:00,289
So let me craft something

684
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:07,809
Uh, what do I want to do? So we couldn't find the thing that you wanted to find you said buy bombs from this guy

685
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,489
Yeah

686
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:13,920
bomb grenade or bomb

687
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,070
Uh, not grenades but what dine either bombs or dynamite dynamite's very expensive though

688
00:55:21,269 --> 00:55:27,480
How many should I have like five ten?

689
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,679
I have 64 right now. You have 64 bombs

690
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,219
Yeah, what?

691
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:35,219
I just spent all my money on bomb

692
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:42,449
Do you have any of the nature essences?

693
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,599
um

694
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:48,360
nature essence

695
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,599
It might it might be torches on the ground

696
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,719
what

697
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,199
I just like threw everything in there. So I put my bomb back

698
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,320
Everything that I don't know what it's used for is just going in this chest

699
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,320
Okay, that's how you should do it. I'll make a second chest because we'll probably need more

700
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Before we can get the super chest

701
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,239
potions apple torch

702
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:19,909
Annoying how does it how does a copper axe annoying?

703
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:27,159
I don't know dude candy cane. Well, I want that out just in case I need it. No, what's my thinking?

704
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:30,039
Don't use those doesn't mind

705
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:34,389
All right wand of sparking or

706
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,710
Superior amethyst staff 15

707
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,269
13 4% crit

708
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,409
I mean, okay

709
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:42,929
blue good

710
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:48,849
Green great and then what like purple legendary or something hot? What's the item? Yeah, it's just like there's random names

711
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:51,090
There's like murderous godly legendary

712
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:59,059
They're all like the same basic stats still as long as it's not negative. It's fine. So green is better than blue

713
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:03,969
I actually don't know the order

714
00:57:03,969 --> 00:57:05,969
I'm just gonna prefixes. Okay

715
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:13,750
All right, so um

716
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:19,030
Are we gonna stick around in here? We're gonna adventure again or what do you want to do? Um, hold on

717
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:23,190
I'm grabbing these stars and then we're gonna go to the right because it's gonna help speed things up a lot if we can

718
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,869
Find that the corruption was looking for it's probably just right up where we started

719
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,760
Make sure I get all my shit ready

720
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,639
Okay, I got i'm all right

721
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:39,840
Purple is the best

722
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,239
All right sick. All right, let's go

723
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,719
Uh, here's mana

724
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:56,360
Oh now I have three mana stars

725
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:05,219
Now you don't think this is too dark don't you think we should have like a path lit up maybe one day

726
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:09,280
I can do a flare

727
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,909
All right zombie ahead

728
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,909
Just I want to make sure you can see him

729
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:21,670
I can see clearly. What is that weapon that you're using right now? You have like a big like claw

730
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:37,110
You have torches in your hot bar. Yeah, I know but he got mad at me when I did this

731
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:42,230
I'm sure you can you can do that all you want. I'm not gonna get mad

732
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,190
You said torrent

733
00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:54,550
I meant like torches on the ground and the base were annoying because you the ground on the base gets filled up by a whole bunch

734
00:58:54,550 --> 00:59:00,239
of nonsense

735
00:59:05,969 --> 00:59:16,360
I can make some wood armor. Do you have any armor on a tiny bit? What's that?

736
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,670
fallen star

737
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:21,670
That's it. That's what you need three of

738
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:23,460
Really?

739
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,860
Yeah, and after I have three of these I can what?

740
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,579
Combine them into the mana crystal. Oh

741
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:33,409
Somebody's house. Oh

742
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,050
Wait, this is where you built this. This is where we started. Oh, okay

743
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:42,130
Why don't we just use this place? That place is way better than yours

744
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:45,889
You think it is

745
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:51,250
But you're wrong, oh because we're not that one doesn't have people trapped inside of walls to make sure they stay there

746
00:59:51,969 --> 00:59:56,130
Yeah, so what does this mean stir? I've got snapped in half by a demon eye

747
00:59:56,769 --> 00:59:58,769
That's where we died

748
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:17,250
Track i'm gonna track them lead the target star got snapped

749
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:31,719
Look at these air shots

750
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:33,719
So i'm assuming we're probably gonna do a thing

751
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:38,599
Where we just both stand above cave and drop bombs down the cave

752
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:44,559
eventually

753
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,840
That is the plan or we get the super bomb that auto drills to hell

754
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,010
Auto drills to hell

755
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:59,280
Yeah, if I alt click an item it locks them so I don't auto deposit them. That's good to know. Oh, yeah

756
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,199
Yeah, yeah, that's important

757
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:08,679
So why don't we just like start digging down and maneuvering?

758
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,889
Why are we just walking left and right?

759
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,030
there's

760
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:20,789
Okay, we've been playing for an hour and all we've done is walk very far left and right. It's all it's all you've done

761
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,630
I didn't even have to make noise for that one

762
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:29,460
All right, somebody's house

763
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,980
This is one of the mods. It's a boss, but only in hard mode

764
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,860
But it has a chest up here

765
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:41,059
Listen, I had money

766
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:44,500
and nothing else

767
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,739
Nothing else. Okay. This is what I was looking for

768
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,780
Something got in here. How did this get in here?

769
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
It's not placing torches. I died

770
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,539
I I can't go down

771
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:02,550
Why did you bring me in this? That snowman's gonna fuck you up, dude

772
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:06,039
Remember to heal h h h

773
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:11,840
What is this?

774
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,519
What did you bring us?

775
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:20,840
Don't shoot

776
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,840
Okay, you need to keep these off of me

777
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,159
We need to fight these we need to fight while we descend down into the corruption

778
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:30,960
bomb the shadow orbs

779
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,280
This is giving too many things. This is not like the first zone in world of warcraft

780
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
i'm still right now on

781
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:40,820
kill the

782
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,099
boars

783
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:46,260
And you're telling me we're gonna bomb through the shaft. We're gonna run through this way. You got five seconds

784
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,900
Pick up the crystal

785
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:54,469
It's a very simple drama. We just have to descend the shaft

786
01:02:55,030 --> 01:03:03,030
I have no torches. No

787
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:05,190
I like this music send the shaft kill the snowman

788
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,920
All right, if you can do the entire

789
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,280
Do you want to build a snowman song right now? And I mean without even looking it up and just going I will give you

790
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:17,519
a dollar

791
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,400
No, I would give you a dollar and store credit to game stop

792
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,840
Holy shit, I thought you just killed yourself. I thought I did too

793
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:28,710
Dude

794
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:31,750
You're the one who doesn't know what they're doing and you're going faster than me

795
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,670
I'm just trying to get back up

796
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,190
Give me the apples

797
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:45,599
All right. I'm good. Remember one apple right right right right right right one apple

798
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:59,800
You brought me into the first like wow dungeon before I even know what my character's rotation is

799
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:07,940
Your rotation is shoot staff i'm the person that gets screamed at in the dead minds because I don't know how to heal somebody

800
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:15,559
I'm the person in the dead minds that's playing a healer. That is auto attack right clicking on people

801
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:19,639
And cannot figure out why all right, let's go

802
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:38,230
It's too fast, okay, see those orbs under the ground are you zoomed out enough that you can see them?

803
01:04:38,869 --> 01:04:40,869
um, no, yes

804
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:45,250
I can see the pearls. That's what we're here for. We're here for those pearls. I need the bomb

805
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,769
Should I just should I just kill the enemies?

806
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:56,360
Yeah

807
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,679
Don't fall in that hole. I'm gonna try not to

808
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,480
How do you just how do you throw bombs?

809
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:11,380
In your in your spot holding dude, you're gonna don't die. Don't die

810
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,260
That worm's coming up again

811
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:24,159
Okay, I hardly knew you

812
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,550
I was gonna hang out in the house

813
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:36,050

Oh, man, I forgot you can be annoying in this game

818
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:56,500
You're like the moment, you know that you can be a bard and play music and enemies you

824
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:22,789
I don't know. We'll find out

825
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:29,590
But also in terraria when you have a full set like if you have a helmet armor and leggings of uh cactus

826
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,670
Then you get an extra bonus

827
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,110
Okay

828
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,110
cactus

829
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,469
I had to do that. Hold on. Where does this go?

830
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,170
All right, that's better. How many do I need? Oh what?

831
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,130
When I was only two

832
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,329
Why is it?

833
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:55,809
Why is there a uh metal gear rising?

834
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,840
Like bar down here how well I did on the level?

835
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,920
No reason

836
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,000
Are you fighting a boss right now?

837
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,010
No, I ran

838
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,190
Okay cactus lamp

839
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Cactus, how do I make cactus armor?

840
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:24,289
Uh stand near the anvil

841
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,289
And you have enough of it and it'll show the option when you press escape

842
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:35,809
You bombed a second. What it's supposed to be three to some of them

843
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,670
I only thought I did the two

844
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:43,670
There were two right there. Okay, whatever

845
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,070
I didn't pick anything up from it. Did I?

846
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:51,699
How the fuck I need my axe

847
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,300
I think I have to go back

848
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:01,760
Where's my pickaxe? There it is

849
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:08,130
Let's get

850
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:17,939
Cactus

851
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,060
You can't even cut cacti with a sword zero out of ten

852
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:32,130
You can pickaxe the sand underneath the cactus and then the whole cactus goes away. Oh

853
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,409
Do you get more for doing it like this or does it not matter at all the same?

854
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,680
Oh hold shift to auto select the correct tool

855
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,270
Well, that's the best fucking advice. I've heard all day

856
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,310
I didn't know you could do that

857
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:51,409
Holy shit, that's that's that's amazing

858
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,250
Wow

859
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:58,470
um

860
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:01,510
That's the best. Yeah, that works wonders

861
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:04,399
Like I had 32 copper

862
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:14,500
Hold control while mining to make it easier

863
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:19,479
Gotta hold shift gotta hold control gotta what else do I gotta do?

864
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:24,239
Hold me in your arm. I think I have enough

865
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,579
I remember watching you play this before a long long long time ago

866
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:42,039
and eventually you got to a point where

867
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,159
There was so much going on on the screen at the same time

868
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,359
Yeah, it turns into a bullet hell. Yeah, it was just

869
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:51,479
This fire everywhere. You would just like

870
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,079
Like a machine gun out of your hands

871
01:09:55,079 --> 01:10:00,689
Yep. Right now. This is our humble beginnings

872
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,619
but you turn into like uh

873
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:10,260
All right a jojo character you guys like jojo, right? That's all you're talking about. It's like underwear cactus bikini

874
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:18,899
Ooh, I have a good spell for you. And now we're ready to slam a boss cactus leggings

875
01:10:19,859 --> 01:10:21,829
cool

876
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:23,909
Cactus breastplate

877
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:26,390
cactus helmet

878
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:30,310
So is it boots or is it just legs head and uh breastplate?

879
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:34,550
Legs head breastplate. Yeah, and is there a certain place I have to put this?

880
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,520
Uh, if you right click it it goes to the right side of your screen. There's an inventory over there like what you're wearing equipment

881
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
If you right click it'll auto equip

882
01:10:46,899 --> 01:10:48,500
Oh, I see. Okay

883
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,279
Why does this guy keep talking to me?

884
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,699
Trying to get past the

885
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,630
All right, so I have uh, i'm i'm

886
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:00,869
I currently am

887
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:03,270
Uh aquaman

888
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,789
Gingerbread cookie

889
01:11:16,789 --> 01:11:18,579
mistletoe

890
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:19,859
Oh

891
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:23,220
Modern improvement to all stats for 30 minutes. Do you want this?

892
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,069
Uh, I feel like this is a u item

893
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:32,979
What are you? Hey, what is what have you been doing?

894
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,239
Don't tell what the fuck are you doing?

895
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:41,319
What are you doing?

896
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:46,720
That was my lamp

897
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,720
Oh my god, our beds are right next to each other

898
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:53,079
Well, no, they're not our heads are

899
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,010
All right

900
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,010
Are we ready to fight this boss?

901
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:01,489
Um, there's a couple things we need hold on. Let me look up the other one rotten. All right

902
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:03,489
I need to put some stuff away

903
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,840
Wait, I gotta make the don't deposit this thing, right?

904
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:11,079
Can you alt click? What is it?

905
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,600
And my bombs? Yeah, does that work?

906
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,359
Kind of you look very good. All right

907
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:28,630
You can hover over your armor to see the set bonus

908
01:12:29,029 --> 01:12:31,029
Plus one defense. Oh, that's cool

909
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,609
Okay, we need to wait for night. I need to get one of those stars

910
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:40,850
Also, we need to kill a storm antlion, which is going to be in this

911
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:44,529
Antlion, but it's blue. It's very different than other animals

912
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:47,409
This is way more than I thought this game was

913
01:12:48,449 --> 01:12:50,449
This game has a lot

914
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,850
and like I said

915
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:58,130
It turns into a bullet hole

916
01:12:58,130 --> 01:12:58,449
All right

917
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:00,289
So what i'm going to do after I do this fun

918
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:05,010
We do this fun little tutorial session where we hang out and we fight a few bosses and we play for a while

919
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:09,810
Uh, i'm gonna like look up those wikipedia articles of this game

920
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,289
And then determine after reading the wiki pages if it's like yeah, i'm gonna do this long term

921
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:22,390
We'll get well like after we start killing the first few things here. We're gonna pick up

922
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:25,029
The pace really quickly in a moment

923
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:33,189
What are you doing? I'm broken

924
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,859
Oh, I have to give you the thing

925
01:13:39,939 --> 01:13:41,939
thing, uh

926
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,020
That i'm dropping it right here

927
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,260
Is that in vile thorn?

928
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:49,000
I pick it up again

929
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,880
So what is this? That is that is your new wand

930
01:13:52,439 --> 01:13:54,439
new wand

931
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:00,840
Oh 10 magic damage, can I is there a way I can like compare two items?

932
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:06,149
No, just trust me. That one's better. This one's better multi hits a lot

933
01:14:06,869 --> 01:14:11,029
So the damage is misleading

934
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:13,399
Whoa

935
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:15,000
Not as far though

936
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Yeah, it's pretty short range, but it's

937
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:22,199
Especially because the first bosses we're gonna fight are like worms it multi hits all the segments of the worm and does a lot of damage

938
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Oh, that's cool

939
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:38,420
A lot of stuff down here

940
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:45,060
on healing push off

941
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,600
God damn

942
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:49,479
See what you're standing on right now. I don't think we can mine it yet or bomb it

943
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,720
I don't think bombing works, but we need these fossils

944
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:56,199
We need better pickaxes, which we'll get after we fight the first bosses. Okay

945
01:14:57,079 --> 01:15:00,920
It's really good in tight spaces

946
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:13,840
Oh, you can do a little a little in between huh? Yeah, it goes all

947
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:16,479
Oh, yeah, it shoots through walls too. Oh

948
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,680
Kind of out of mana

949
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,680
When you do get mana potions j

950
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:24,319
Uses them

951
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,720
For germa day for germa. I know that and that's my name

952
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,479
Oh and enemies drop stars that give you mana. Yeah

953
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:35,359
Picked up on that a little bit

954
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:48,659
These are the ones we I need a a mandible from one of these these blue boys, man. Okay, we got it

955
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:50,340
Okay, we can leave

956
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,479
What about that coin?

957
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:56,020
a coin

958
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:59,079
There's a coin over there

959
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:01,159
It's a it's a silver coin. I don't care

960
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:12,899
Well, what an adventure that was feeling germs never gonna play this again

961
01:16:17,569 --> 01:16:20,050
Uh, I don't know it seems like it's kind of fun

962
01:16:23,670 --> 01:16:24,710
uh

963
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:29,750
Walk left and right find one of the fallen stars and don't combine it. We need one. I have one

964
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,770
Uh, okay drop it. I love this dude. Oh my god

965
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:43,439
I know

966
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,789
Oh, I know two enemies are nearby. We need another one

967
01:16:47,510 --> 01:17:01,409
And we need a furnace I need to make torches rope coil how can I can craft copper coins?

968
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,729
Uh, it changes your silver coins into copper coins

969
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:12,579
Find the fallen

Issue here

973
01:17:26,369 --> 01:17:29,699
All right. This thing actually is pretty great

974
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:39,060
That's shit. I need

975
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:47,109

Magic weapon proficiency leveled up

There's a guy with a gun

982
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,199
There's a guy with a gun

983
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:22,760
I'm dead. What's going on? You have to wait to respawn

984
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:25,159
I'm not dead

985
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,329

986
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:35,590
Holy shit. I did it

01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,880
And I still can't even see I gotta come back

988
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,359
Okay, they're like 5000 more enemies or something

989
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:55,380
Uh, no, it's wood for

990
01:18:56,020 --> 01:18:57,380
torches, right

991
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,680
Do you have sand block?

992
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,079
Uh, I can you probably do right?

993
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:05,039
I can

994
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:12,739
Why would he need sand for?

995
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:14,979
I'm crafting the thing that summons the boss

996
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,520
I'm getting sand right now

997
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,319
I think I have enough

01:19:21,319 --> 01:19:24,000
He's just in darkness. Yes, I am

999
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,079
All right. I have some sand blocks

1000

01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,520
I think I have some cactus stored

Can you make another room and you use the room example to make a new room?

1012
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:20,229
Yeah

1013
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:22,229
And maybe trusting you with a lot here

1014
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:27,970
Uh, do we have enough wood?

1015
01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:29,810
We only have 11 wood

1016
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:31,810
Okay, uh, I have wood

1017
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:36,229

Three wide with a torch

1022
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,720
And then it gets down to the bottom and you need a chair

1023
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,760
Three wide with three wide

1024
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,680

01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,960
Okay, that's it

1033
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:50,520
Okay, what do you want me to do with this and then put a chair in here

1034
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:56,159
A torch first

1035
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,760
I don't have any torches

1036
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:08,390
I need to make some

1037
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,829

1048
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:41,149

Once it's daytime we can fight this boss tell star he's handsome. I will that's a lot of money

1050
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,029
Thank you so much tim and then the ball is really going to start rolling

1051
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:55,869
Uh, somebody said that you are handsome that tim says you're handsome. They they paid me 50 dollars to tell you that

1052
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,470
I'm streaming

1053
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,390
Yeah, you you are streaming

1054
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:11,149
You could have paid him 50 dollars and say hey, you're handsome you paid me 50 dollars to tell him he's handsome

1055
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,220
All right

1056
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:18,899
so now

1057
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:21,069
um

1058
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:23,390
Why are we trapping people in these like cages here?

1059
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:30,050
Um, this is to make sure that they don't leave is that what i'm understanding. Uh, it's easy to talk to them

1060
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:34,609
Um, so it's efficient to just walk through here and talk to them because you need the npcs

1061
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:40,210
There's like you need like collectively 30 rooms by the end of terraria. There's a lot of people

1062
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:47,409
So if you would like to make them an actual house for 30 people you're more than welcome to start doing that

1063
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:04,289
I'll tell you you're handsome for free. Thanks, man

1064
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:08,210
But you'll get but you'll give me the money to that's funny

1065
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,119
All right. I got a lot of burgers. So i'm gonna go to the food department

1066
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,689
Why is there a goldfish walking around outside?

1067
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,510
I oh

1068
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:21,949
Get up

1069
01:24:21,949 --> 01:24:25,170
That was terrible

1070
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,569
I saw that coming from a mile away, too. I couldn't do anything

1071
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,199
I couldn't protect him

1072
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,199
He didn't seem to be bothered by it though

1073
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:41,420
Ooh, that was close

1074
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,739
Yeah with the um, the way the ground is in front of the door

1075
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:49,340
Normally monsters will hit doors, but they have to jump first because there's a gap they can't open these

1076
01:24:49,899 --> 01:24:51,899
So you can just shoot them through the wall

1077
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,939
You freaking cheater so you have to summon bosses

1078
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,819
Uh

1079
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:03,579
Not all of them, but generally yeah, what does jeffrey do?

1080
01:25:05,979 --> 01:25:09,260
What does jeffrey do? I don't know. What does jeffrey do?

1081
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:14,539
Which one's jeffrey their names are randomized. Oh jeffrey. Okay, this is important

1082
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,479
Okay, he gave me 50. Oh, he's just he's just a nice guy. He says sorry

1083
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,119
Don't be sorry

1084
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,960
Thank you very much

1085
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:27,199
When you talk to jeffrey you click crafting

1086
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,359
And then you see on the left side of your screen says place material here

1087
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:34,449
Uh, hold on

1088
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,920
Crafting place material here

1089
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:42,159
So if you put a material there, he'll tell you everything that material can potentially make

1090
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,720
Oh, man

1091
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,300

1092
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,630

Should have given that to me. I didn't know you had haters

1106
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,859
I didn't know I was streaming with a person who had haters

1107
01:26:53,649 --> 01:26:56,420
haters

1108
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:59,939

I just saw the explosions and I was like, oh yes, I'll do that too

1135
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:11,439
I felt like I was supposed to be doing that

1136
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,500
It's all right. It was just this side

1137
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,550
All right, there's somebody in here

1138
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:19,550

1147
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:48,189

1166
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:05,090
You can actually use your recall potions to teleport back into the base

1167
01:31:06,289 --> 01:31:09,170
And we don't have the medic yet, but dude, just we'll be fine

1168
01:31:09,409 --> 01:31:13,970
You know, i'm gonna summon them over here. I think should I not throw you're not gonna throw any bombs. Don't throw bombs

1169
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:16,609
Don't throw bombs only use my auto attack

1170
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:22,460
Where is he?

1171
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:27,500
Ow, yeah, we're still slowing like don't have any movement

1172
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:43,630
You can't get me

1173
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,630
He can teleport i'm dead

1174
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,720
You can do it. He's almost dead. I was a distraction

1175
01:31:58,689 --> 01:31:59,890
four percent

1176
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:02,930
Zero point five percent zero percent. Come on fill the dots

1177
01:32:03,569 --> 01:32:18,539
I got him nice. Why don't I spawn all the way back here?

1178
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,520
Oh, that's it's some I don't know if it's a random bug that it spawns you there sometimes or you

1179
01:32:27,739 --> 01:32:30,880
Accidentally right click your bed and it unsets your spawn point

1180
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:32,720
Is it very annoying?

1181
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,159
You might have

1182
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:37,739
So I I think we need to put our beds

1183
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,000
Somewhere else. Oh, so we don't accidentally right click them people saying I blew up the bed

1184
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:44,399
You

1185
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,399
I don't think you did. Did I not?

1186
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,779
Yeah, no, the bed's still there. I think he just accidentally right clicked it

1187
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:56,300
The wall was damaged so that room no longer counts for a bed to work. Oh, that's actually true

1188
01:32:56,539 --> 01:33:06,899
Uh guys do you make the um, I have cthulhu summon at a demon altar or can you do it in an anvil?

1189
01:33:09,779 --> 01:33:13,060
Uh guys, do you know how to play the game because I don't

1190
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,250
Why don't I have a door in my inventory?

1191
01:33:17,409 --> 01:33:22,979
Yeah, i'm gonna make jerma jealous

1192
01:33:23,779 --> 01:33:25,779
He wants to ride the slime

1193
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:28,479
How do I put the door down?

1194
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:30,479
Uh, there's no wall

1195
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:38,670
There you go, okay, so now we can right click this spawn point set

1196
01:33:39,710 --> 01:33:43,489
Oh, you trapped him. Okay

1197
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:49,899
all right, so

1198
01:33:50,539 --> 01:33:53,180
You're doing a lot of playing and not a whole lot of describing

1199
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:58,539
Describing so we just killed two bosses. We just killed that guy. He got me this

1200
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,859
He got you that

1201
01:34:00,859 --> 01:34:02,859
Yeah, what is he getting?

1202
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,180
What did he get you? I want to he got me my hidden blade technique throwing knife technique

1203
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,960
Cool, you're getting a lot of fun stuff. Um, when do I get the super mario shoe?

1204
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:18,239
Um, their percentage chance drops and he didn't really drop any mage shit, so you didn't really get anything

1205
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:26,829
Sorry, dude. All right. Bye. So let's go

1206
01:34:27,869 --> 01:34:29,979
i'm ready

1207
01:34:29,979 --> 01:34:32,510
um

1208
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:34,510
We could probably

1209
01:34:35,409 --> 01:34:37,409
Kill the eater of worlds

1210
01:34:37,409 --> 01:34:39,409
the eater of worlds

1211
01:34:39,489 --> 01:34:41,489
Yeah, and then we'll start getting

1212
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:47,579
We'll start getting

1213
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:53,739
Games with stir. He takes all the drops and leaves you 10 miles behind. There's actually there are clearly no drops for him

1214
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:07,260
I didn't yeah, I didn't say anything. I know it's true. It's fine

1215
01:35:09,899 --> 01:35:14,300
Uh, i'm okay with that. I need to go see down here if dynamite

1216
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,659
Destroys fossil. I don't think it does

1217
01:35:18,699 --> 01:35:21,180
I'm gonna go i'm gonna go over here. I'm gonna go over here

1218
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:32,180
I'm gonna just go this way. Wait, are we leaving our friends vulnerable doors open? It does not um

1219
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:39,359
They're a little vulnerable. All right, I closed the doors. I'm you know, i'm gonna go down. I'm gonna go down like a little cave

1220
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:41,600
There's another boss we can fight right now

1221
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:49,199
Uh, I think I think I can do it right now. Oh my god, can you fucking refill this sand? Can you show some responsibility?

1222
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,460
What's sand?

1223
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:58,300
The hole you made refill it with sand is it's keeping it keeps up the enemies but it's keeping me out too

1224
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:00,859
How do I open this door?

1225
01:36:00,859 --> 01:36:04,460
Oh, you can't open it inward now because I placed the furnace there. Oh

1226
01:36:05,899 --> 01:36:11,739
We're running out of space. All right, i'll fix it. I'll fix the sand just hold on. Yeah, and I can summon a boss

1227
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,140
Let me fix the sand first

1228
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,539
We have to do it before tonight time. Let's do it now

1229
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:20,460
And then you fix the sand

1230
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:26,319
The grand thunderbird has awoken

1231
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:29,359
He'll like charge at you. Do you need to jump over him?

1232
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,010
No

1233
01:36:35,010 --> 01:36:38,930
Oh, i'm out of musket. Oh, he's like glitching out. What the fuck

1234
01:36:40,289 --> 01:36:42,289
It should be easier than the other ones we fought

1235
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:46,399
Theoretically, I can't really reach him

1236
01:36:58,369 --> 01:37:10,079
I can't reach him

1237
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:25,250
I'm not big enough. Okay. Here you go. Jerma. What do you got now?

1238
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:28,449
Oh

1239
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:30,529
Let me look at a bird a bird friend

1240
01:37:32,909 --> 01:37:37,550
11 summon summon damage very weak knockback uses 10 minutes summons a hatchling to zap your foes

1241
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:41,600
So I should use more than one item ticket, right?

1242
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,560
Yeah, you can always that summon will always be out as long as you cast it. Oh, okay. Cool

1243
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,199
Wow, he's going down again. It follows things and shoots things. Okay. Now take these

1244
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:57,840
This is a learning moment because i'm not gonna leave you 10 miles behind. These are sandstone ingots. Yep, take those to the guide

1245
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,079
Okay, and do the crafting thing so you can see what you can make from sandstone

1246
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:04,640
Okay

1247
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,979
But first let me do my responsibility

1248
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,560
Which is fix this shit up

1249
01:38:13,970 --> 01:38:16,050
He's gonna craft a sandstone bath

1250
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,500
I mean if you're dirty

1251
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,310
Can you do that?

1252
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,939
And maybe

1253
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:24,699
I don't think so

1254
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:30,239
The sand also always falls when you place it so you can place it from up here and it'll drop down

1255
01:38:35,859 --> 01:38:37,539
Fixed it

1256
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:42,340
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What what what we need the tube below the door so monsters don't get in

1257
01:38:42,979 --> 01:38:45,789
Oh

1258
01:38:45,789 --> 01:38:46,829
Okay

1259
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:47,789
All right

1260
01:38:47,789 --> 01:38:50,029
for the sandstone

1261
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:53,550
Into this guy's uh slot here

1262
01:38:54,829 --> 01:38:57,470
Showing recipes that use sandstone ingot

1263
01:38:58,430 --> 01:39:00,430
so i'm wand and

1264
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:01,550
uh

1265
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:03,069
Wand guy, right?

1266
01:39:03,069 --> 01:39:05,069
Oh sandstone pickaxe

1267
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:08,750
We need one of those really bad actually sandstone pickaxe

1268
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:13,069
What about um sandstone greaves?

1269
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:19,020
Uh pickaxe 100 we need it

1270
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:22,510
Okay

1271
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,670
I'm sorry. I've made this seem like you're gonna have choices

1272
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:28,350
Uh, did I make it?

1273
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:31,310
You have to actually go to the anvil and make it. He's just showing you what you can make

1274
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,550
It's not in your inventory while you're showing it to him

1275
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:36,939
What did I just do I just heard like that

1276
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:42,399
What the hell was that? Oh, no. No, he just gave it back to me. Okay, I get it

1277
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,520
Yeah, all right anvil

1278
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:49,180
Uh sandstone pickaxe should we both have one do you want one too?

1279
01:39:51,329 --> 01:39:52,449
um

1280
01:39:52,449 --> 01:39:55,250
Only one of us needs to have one. Okay, so then should I make

1281
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:57,569
like a

1282
01:39:57,569 --> 01:40:03,729
Sandstone big yeah, we if there's also something you want to make I can summon the boss again and we can get more sandstone ingot

1283
01:40:04,130 --> 01:40:05,409
We can

1284
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:07,489
Yeah, actually

1285
01:40:07,489 --> 01:40:12,130
I'm remembering the sandstone armor set is really really good, but we're gonna kill him like twice

1286
01:40:12,529 --> 01:40:14,930
Okay, so I got sandstone helmet sandstone greaves

1287
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:17,170
Yeah

1288
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:19,409
Two percent movement speed five percent throwing damage

1289
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:22,770
All right, i'm gonna make the helmet

1290
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:26,960
Are there multiple helmets?

1291
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:28,960
This nothing I don't think so

1292
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:32,560
I've made sandstone helmet thrower class fuck

1293
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,020
Did I do something wrong?

1294
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,380
No, you're fine

1295
01:40:38,619 --> 01:40:40,619
There's not like a mage class

1296
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:47,340
Sometimes armor sets have multiple helmets so you can make it your class, but I think that set only has one. Okay

1297
01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:51,659
Well, I have it on now

1298
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:56,060
Oh, that looks cool. You can only summon him during the day though. So we've got some time you have the pickaxe

1299
01:40:56,779 --> 01:40:57,819
I do

1300
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,819
Let's go in this hole

1301
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:06,699
So the pickaxe this pickaxe is like really weak and slow and stuff

1302
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:11,420
Or is it is there any is there any reason at all for me to ever use?

1303
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:17,420
The copper pickaxe ever again. No, once you get a new pickaxe, the old one is done forever. Okay

1304
01:41:18,619 --> 01:41:23,090
I'm gonna sell it

1305
01:41:23,649 --> 01:41:28,050
The like old shit like copper pickaxe is really not even worth selling either. Oh

1306
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:33,979
Okay, so we this is how you can get that. Uh

1307
01:41:34,699 --> 01:41:37,739
This is how they get the shit that we couldn't get before the fossil stuff, right?

1308
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:43,979
I'm pretty sure we can get fossil with that pickaxe. Yeah, and we need that pretty bad willy the traveling merchant has

1309
01:41:44,939 --> 01:41:54,989
Disappeared okay right down here. This like dirt ground is possible

1310
01:41:57,119 --> 01:41:58,800
Okay

1311
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,020
Does that work?

1312
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:07,500
Dang, then we still can't get it. I'm pretty sure we're gonna need to get demonite pickaxe

1313
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,619
So what can we do with this? Is it just faster?

1314
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:15,359
Just faster. Yeah

1315
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,479
It'll if you look at your pickaxe it says pickaxe power

1316
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:24,000
Something percent 55 percent power. Yeah, my power on my wood pickaxe is 30

1317
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,439
Oh, so it's like that much faster demons

1318
01:42:43,550 --> 01:42:45,550
He did it he did the star

1319
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:48,899
Mine mine mine. You're a newbie

1320
01:42:49,699 --> 01:42:52,739
You I gave you the other one. I I gave you mine anyways

1321
01:42:55,489 --> 01:43:05,060
noob

1322
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:10,050
Wow, I'm almost dead. The campfires give more health for jen

1323
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:19,260
Oh, isn't the meteorite fault? Yeah, we could go get the meteorite, but we don't know where it is. I don't think

1324
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:23,039
and

1325
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:27,840
If you think row right would actually become somewhat irrelevant soon here. It's good for mage so we could go do that

1326
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,479
Don't don't drop those stars in daylight. They break

1327
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:33,439
Yeah, i'm yeah

1328
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:39,859
Yeah, I don't know if you knew that. All right, so I got

1329
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:45,699
All right, we need to go in the jungle to get them. We need more minerals people saying

1330

Let's just shut the fuck up

1386
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:29,470

1387
01:48:29,949 --> 01:48:31,949

1395
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:56,850
Alt select them so they don't move and like put them at the bottom right of your inventory

1396
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:58,689
So the next time you're dying

1397
01:48:58,689 --> 01:49:00,850
And you need to like get away quick, you know where they are

1398
01:49:02,289 --> 01:49:08,420
Uh, did you just do that? Yeah use a recall potion. We're gonna fight the boss because it's daytime

1399
01:49:14,699 --> 01:49:16,699

This can't be good for the environment

1405
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,140
This is really messed up actually

1406
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:49,300
Letting out that many helium balloons into the atmosphere

1407
01:49:53,439 --> 01:50:00,479

1408
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,239

01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:41,970
He's so loud. He's pretty loud. He's a screecher

1426
01:51:49,649 --> 01:51:58,670
What he's too far I keep he goes too far away from me

1427
01:51:59,470 --> 01:52:01,899
You have the thing that goes across the whole screen. I don't

1428
01:52:02,779 --> 01:52:09,270
Dermar you're contributing a deadly didgeridoo

1429
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:14,100
What's up? Why do you have?

1430
01:52:14,579 --> 01:52:16,699
What is over your head?

1431
01:52:16,699 --> 01:52:18,539
uh

1432
01:52:18,539 --> 01:52:22,060
Bard inspiration they can only cast like that many times for using music

1433
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:24,369
oh

1434
01:52:24,369 --> 01:52:27,010
And then it buffs people near you and stuff which also

1435
01:52:28,529 --> 01:52:30,369
Isn't magic damage

1436
01:52:30,369 --> 01:52:35,010
So where are all these people there are like hundreds of thousands of people at this party

1437
01:52:36,689 --> 01:52:38,689
The painter showed up

1438
01:52:39,090 --> 01:52:41,090
He can he can just go die

1439
01:52:42,859 --> 01:52:48,850
I came for the party

1440
01:52:48,850 --> 01:52:50,050
So what do you say?

1441
01:52:50,050 --> 01:52:52,590
Go my inventory and what?

1442
01:52:52,590 --> 01:52:54,430
I gave you the armor

1443
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:58,109
You that's all you have now, right? Because you gave me the helmet. I don't see

1444
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:02,590
It's on the roof. Oh armor on roof

1445
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:05,979
Is the painter gonna be okay?

1446
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:11,470
Yeah, let him die

1447
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:13,869
Seriously, let him die. Why is he bad?

1448
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:17,520
He doesn't do anything

1449
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,359
All right, so we rely on unless you want two birds, but this makes you double jump

1450
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:24,000
I kind of I want two birds. I think but hold on

1451
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,979
I can do the the helmet. No, I can do the

1452
01:53:28,699 --> 01:53:30,060
the greaves

1453
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:32,060
And you need the whole step for a double jump

1454
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:35,739
The two birds are really good

1455
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:47,710
No, i'm gonna hold on. I want the two birds

1456
01:53:47,789 --> 01:53:48,670

1457
01:53:48,670 --> 01:53:50,109

1498
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:42,300
This is very overwhelming, but it's very fun. All right, hold on

1499
01:56:42,939 --> 01:56:45,619
10 mana 5 mana

1500
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:46,899
fast

1501
01:56:46,899 --> 01:56:48,899
16 damage 4% for it

1502
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:51,220
All right. This is this is good

1503
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:54,399
golden duck

1504
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:59,359
Can you actually do anything with the gold animals besides think they're cool?

1505
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:08,399
I mean that answer is no. I thought that was a sound board that you just put in

1506
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:12,130
That boing was oh no, what?

1507
01:57:12,689 --> 01:57:14,850
Jump makes you go forward a little faster

1508
01:57:15,649 --> 01:57:18,420
Don't leave me hanging

1509
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:24,750
Oh, yeah, you don't have it

1510
01:57:25,939 --> 01:57:28,369
You can sell them for gold

1511
01:57:28,369 --> 01:57:31,180
So why are you killing them?

1512
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:32,850
Okay, jerma

1513
01:57:32,850 --> 01:57:36,050
Go through the process of like taming an animal do it

1514
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:39,869
Is it a pain in the ass?

1515
01:57:39,869 --> 01:57:43,069
I don't know how to do it. It's I know it's 10 gold never done it

1516
01:57:45,819 --> 01:57:47,819
Put them in a net and sell

1517
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:50,539
We only we only imprison people here

1518
01:57:51,659 --> 01:57:53,659
Hey, i'm not the expert. You're supposed to be the expert

1519
01:57:57,390 --> 01:57:59,390
So what's the current objective now?

1520
01:57:59,470 --> 01:58:01,470
The current objective is to go back to that

1521
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:07,579
Corruption area the purple area when you destroy three of those shadow orbs it summons a boss

1522
01:58:08,539 --> 01:58:09,420
Oh

1523
01:58:09,420 --> 01:58:11,180
We want to kill that boss

1524
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:13,180
Because then we can mine the fossil

1525
01:58:14,609 --> 01:58:16,689
And then when we can mine the fossil we can go to hell

1526
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:23,779
This is cool

1527
01:58:23,779 --> 01:58:26,399
Not on expert mode

1528
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:28,720
No, what would expert mode change?

1529
01:58:30,449 --> 01:58:34,050
bosses get more health deal more damage and you die a lot

1530
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,239
and it takes like

1531
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:40,319
Three times as long to play through and do anything

1532
01:58:41,359 --> 01:58:43,359
I uh, we would not have killed one boss yet

1533
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:50,859
Hmm. That's good. I've got like a spelunking potion

1534
01:58:51,420 --> 01:58:54,960
What was that?

1535
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,960
It's way more good

1536
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:00,560
Yeah, you get there's more interesting drops than expert but I i'm

1537
01:59:01,970 --> 01:59:03,250
You wouldn't want to play it

1538
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:06,609
I just try I probably wouldn't not on my first ever time playing the game

1539
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:09,170
I think you like don't even know what anything

1540
01:59:10,289 --> 01:59:12,289
And you're like, where am I not expert mode?

1541
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:15,090
Would I do it like would I talk like that?

1542
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:17,090
No, that's what the other guy would talk like

1543
01:59:19,069 --> 01:59:27,779
Oh

1544
01:59:27,779 --> 01:59:29,779
Dark too dark. Oh

1545
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:32,539
Holy shit. Thank god

1546
01:59:32,539 --> 01:59:34,539
This little thing just saved my life

1547
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:37,100
No, it didn't um

1548
01:59:37,579 --> 01:59:47,949
How did you even get over there? Oh, you have a double jump, right? I can't just follow you blindly

1549
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:56,140
How do you heal yourself?

1550
01:59:56,140 --> 02:00:02,539
Ah, I can't mine this

1551
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:05,579
No, all right. I gotta put a platform down on that helmet

1552
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:09,649
Especially for this boss trust, but you're gonna need it

1553
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,199
Let's sacrifice the one bird for now

1554
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:19,359
Really? I just hit my fucking head on this

1555
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,920
You have to hold space you spend longer

1556
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,859
All right. I think i'm good

1557
02:00:24,859 --> 02:00:30,750
A horrible chill goes down your spine

1558
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:36,319
Okay, take this

1559
02:00:36,319 --> 02:00:38,579
as well

1560
02:00:38,579 --> 02:00:40,460
Musket

1561
02:00:40,460 --> 02:00:44,619
And i'm taking this for what specific reason because it does 32 damage

1562
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:47,739
Oh, that's a lot

1563
02:00:47,819 --> 02:00:49,819
Um use that as your long range

1564
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,260
Your vile thorn will be a lot better on this boss though

1565
02:00:54,140 --> 02:00:56,220
Okay

1566
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:58,140
all right

1567
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:02,880
vile thorn on the boss

1568
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,479
Oh, don't don't walk in those bombs

1569
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:14,350
I need more light down here, man. I'm gonna have to put some hold on

1570
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:19,949
If we're gonna fight a boss like right now, I need to be able to see come back come back

1571
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,640
What you need to start doing is go to the left

1572
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:27,119
And make a rope up to the surface make a rope up to the surface

1573
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,960
Yeah

1574
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:34,029
Remember you can't mine through this so like go back to where we came down and make it as easy as

1575
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:36,829
Possible to get up to the surface

1576
02:01:37,149 --> 02:01:39,149
What?

1577
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:43,170
How did I fall

1578
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:46,420
There's too much pressure

1579
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:47,619
Was it here?

1580
02:01:47,619 --> 02:01:58,189
Was it right here?

1581
02:01:58,189 --> 02:02:00,189
Uh, actually you can wait on the surface for me

1582
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:07,039
Ow, i'm gonna die

1583
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:10,159
No, don't i'm not i'm not i'm fine fine

1584
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,880
I need you fucking dark down here

1585
02:02:35,869 --> 02:02:38,670
Uh, tell me when you're on the surface, uh, not on the surface

1586
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:43,649
Here's I am ready to pull the trigger on the fuck fiesta. Uh, do not do that yet

1587
02:02:54,479 --> 02:03:10,319
Dude, am I out of torches?

1588
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:12,720
And we still like really only have 100 health each

1589
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:15,439
um

1590
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,840
His rope sucks just warning you

1591
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:20,850
Okay

1592
02:03:21,010 --> 02:03:23,010
I need light

1593
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:31,180
I don't know where the fuck i'm going man

1594
02:03:31,579 --> 02:03:33,579
I don't know what i'm doing

1595
02:03:34,989 --> 02:03:36,989
Oh my god, I

1596
02:03:37,069 --> 02:03:41,470
I don't know what i'm doing make it as easy as possible to get to the top

1597
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,779
hell

1598
02:03:44,779 --> 02:03:46,859
I got stuck down here. All right

1599
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:55,039
You know what you just wait on the top and I have a potion to tell it to you

1600
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,500
Why do I have to wait down here?

1601
02:04:00,930 --> 02:04:02,930
Because a giant worm is going to come out on the ground

1602
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:06,220
And if you're inside these tunnels when it appears

1603
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:09,100
You just get warmed

1604
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:11,710
All right, so i'm worried that i'm on the surface

1605
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:15,869
Okay, uh, can you build like a platform above the ground with uh

1606
02:04:17,260 --> 02:04:20,619
Wood platforms. Do you have any? Yeah platform above the ground

1607
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:23,020
You want me just to like go like you had like the other one you had?

1608
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:24,539
Yeah, yeah

1609
02:04:24,539 --> 02:04:26,539
I don't have any fucking torches though

1610
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:35,699
I can't see shit

1611
02:04:35,699 --> 02:04:40,930
Uh, i'm gonna be i'm gonna be very very like just franking up front about this

1612
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:44,380
I don't know if i'm okay. I can't do this

1613
02:04:44,539 --> 02:04:46,539
Um

1614
02:04:46,779 --> 02:04:48,060
It's okay to admit it

1615
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:52,939
I i'm not gonna be like yeah, sure man like here we go. Um, like i'm i'm kind of i'm kind of stuck

1616
02:04:53,739 --> 02:04:57,180
I'm kind of like overwhelmed. I'm gonna summon the boss

1617
02:04:57,899 --> 02:05:01,500
Okay, I need wood. Hold on and then i'm gonna teleport to you

1618
02:05:03,869 --> 02:05:06,109
And then we're just gonna make the best of it with our double jump

1619
02:05:07,229 --> 02:05:10,029
Okay, hold on. I'm gonna turn his brightness up now. I'm enjoying this

1620
02:05:11,149 --> 02:05:15,180
Where do I go?

1621
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:33,539
Doing good

1622
02:05:33,539 --> 02:05:35,460
I can handle this

1623
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:38,590
Hey, uh, I can handle it. Don't worry. Yes. So I believe you

1624
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:44,539
Uh, I a little overwhelming I need

1625
02:05:45,659 --> 02:05:50,819
You see if it would be playing I would probably still be cutting down trees and building a house

1626
02:05:51,539 --> 02:05:57,979
We're fighting like monsters and getting new gear and I I would have just built a candy cane house

1627
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,520
All right. Hold on. You don't have enough candy cane

1628
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:05,300
What the fuck already here?

1629
02:06:10,819 --> 02:06:13,300
I'm just i'm just gonna wait for you and do some other stuff

1630
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,619
I was gonna keep him

1631
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:23,180
Get me please. All right, just

1632
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:26,720
I'm losing my fucking mind

1633
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:37,119
I'm losing my fucking mind. Okay torch. I need just give me a bunch

1634
02:06:39,630 --> 02:06:44,350
How many of these do I have? What is he overwhelmed by? I don't get it. Oh, he made tiki torches. Oh

1635
02:06:44,989 --> 02:06:46,819
fuck

1636
02:06:46,819 --> 02:06:52,340
What am I overwhelmed by? It's just I with um, I don't know. It's like a lot to take in in an hour

1637
02:07:07,420 --> 02:07:13,949
Get out of here. All right

1638
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:23,600
I need to like relax because i'm like actually like panic getting overwhelmed by all this shit in the inventory

1639
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:26,079
And all the things in the game. All right

1640
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:32,029
Okay, get my book up here. No, I don't need that. Okay, I have potions

1641
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:36,000
All right. Let me just deposit this bullshit

1642
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:45,340
I don't know what the fuck I even want with all this. No hold it here. It's fine

1643
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:49,119
Fine get rid of everything else. I I guess

1644
02:07:58,859 --> 02:08:00,859
All right, so I have

1645
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,140
Stupid fucking tiki torches, man

1646
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:06,380
I'm gonna build the thing that you wanted to build

1647
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,180
Right, you're gonna you're gonna do it

1648
02:08:11,779 --> 02:08:12,899
Are you sure?

1649
02:08:12,899 --> 02:08:14,510
Probably not

1650
02:08:14,510 --> 02:08:17,229
I'm worried about is there wood even in do we have any wood?

1651
02:08:17,550 --> 02:08:22,829
I I cut down trees trees on your way back, but I died. There's plenty I died. I fell down a hole

1652
02:08:23,310 --> 02:08:25,149
I think you missed that part

1653
02:08:25,149 --> 02:08:27,149
Yeah, but you still have all your things

1654
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:33,569
Buy torches from the merchant. You see here's the thing. Uh, he has locked

1655
02:08:34,989 --> 02:08:39,789
Like seven people in here. I don't know what any of these people do besides this guy. He sells dynamite

1656
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:57,300
I'm worried about you. No, I'm good rescue

1657
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:00,340
Rescue them. I just start breaking them out

1658
02:09:01,060 --> 02:09:02,020
Okay

1659
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:08,430
I'm just gonna need to come back. I have so much junk in my inventory. So all right. All right. Okay, it's just I

1660
02:09:08,909 --> 02:09:12,350
It's just too dark

1661
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:14,350
What is your gamma at? Tell me what it is

1662
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:31,409
Uh, where is gamma? I don't know. I don't know. It's in nvidia settings

1663
02:09:31,890 --> 02:09:39,869
What is parallax?

1664
02:09:40,829 --> 02:09:43,539
Real

1665
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:44,739
All right. Um

1666
02:09:44,739 --> 02:09:47,699
Did you you're coming back, right? I'm in here with you

1667
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:10,930
So you wanted to deposit stuff? I'm doing a drop. Do you need torches? I can make you torches

1668
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:15,899
No, I have torches

1669
02:10:15,899 --> 02:10:22,609
I figured it out. I have potions. I have torches. I have food

1670
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,720
Video settings change lighting to white

1671
02:10:32,770 --> 02:10:35,710
Why is it like a sandstorm?

1672
02:10:35,710 --> 02:10:40,449
I don't know

1673
02:10:40,449 --> 02:10:42,289
I'll get like 50

1674
02:10:42,289 --> 02:10:44,289
50 is 50 torches good

1675
02:10:44,289 --> 02:10:47,649
You should get more more than 50. Okay

1676
02:10:48,449 --> 02:10:51,409
Because you'll always be using torches. There's no reason to not have more

1677
02:10:52,529 --> 02:10:54,739
If you can make 100

1678
02:10:54,739 --> 02:10:58,270
Like 300

1679
02:10:58,270 --> 02:11:03,229
I mean how much you panic when you don't have a torch. Do you ever want that to happen again? No, never. Okay

1680
02:11:04,029 --> 02:11:09,020
So I got gun. I've got food. I've got health

1681
02:11:09,739 --> 02:11:11,649
I got my bird

1682
02:11:11,649 --> 02:11:13,100
All right

1683
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:15,739
Hey, are we good to start this?

1684
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:40,079
Why would you build a house in the desert? I don't know. This is not my i'm just along for the ride guys

1685
02:11:41,279 --> 02:11:58,500
Do another shift? Yeah, no shift takes out the best tool, right? Yeah

1686
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:01,760
I think also

1687
02:12:07,869 --> 02:12:09,869
Oh, is that a different spot?

1688
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:11,979
Hmm

1689
02:12:11,979 --> 02:12:16,510
Never mind ignore me

1690
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:21,699
That's such a cool item

1691
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:31,119
Oh my god

1692
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:34,560
I don't think hold on imagine you died from up there. That would've been so funny

1693
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:39,149
I don't laugh normally these don't let you jump a second time

1694
02:12:40,189 --> 02:12:43,970
You know, we also need is an anti-gravity potion

1695
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:47,380
What is that?

1696
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:51,220
It turns gravity upside down so you fly up in the air and there's planets in the sky

1697
02:12:53,010 --> 02:12:56,579
Do a zombie impression?

1698
02:12:56,579 --> 02:12:59,060
Like I feel like that's a star thing. That's a star request

1699
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:05,729
Here take mana crystal. Yeah, I just take that right now, right?

1700
02:13:06,699 --> 02:13:08,909
Yeah

1701
02:13:08,909 --> 02:13:10,909
Uh, so you brought wood, right?

1702
02:13:13,279 --> 02:13:16,029
Uh, hold on. Let me

You brought wood, right? I have wood platforms. Yes

1704

02:13:21,010 --> 02:13:23,010
Uh 39 of them

1706
02:13:23,569 --> 02:13:25,569
Is that not enough?

1707
02:13:25,569 --> 02:13:31,409
That's not enough. I didn't tell me a number. I didn't I didn't know if more if yeah, I needed more than like 40

1708
02:13:31,890 --> 02:13:35,329
39 is not enough like 200. I did 200

1709
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:38,210
Okay. Well, let's get them now

1710
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:42,479
All right. I don't I don't even have an axe anymore

1711
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:48,130
I'll get it. I'll get it

1712
02:13:48,689 --> 02:13:51,649
I'm just along for the ride. I'm just along for the ride

1713
02:13:56,460 --> 02:14:01,579
Yeah, I got I i'm i'm about to see i'm a seafood guy. You know, I see food I eat it, you know

1714
02:14:03,659 --> 02:14:05,659
Thanks to the 50 bucks

1715
02:14:09,789 --> 02:14:16,140
Indeed

1716
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:17,659
Okay, i've got

1717
02:14:17,659 --> 02:14:19,659
You see how long this took? I have

1718
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:21,659
340

1719
02:14:21,659 --> 02:14:28,270
Okay, so I have a lot too already, uh, but honestly tim tim gave 50 more dollars

1720
02:14:28,270 --> 02:14:30,350
This is addressed to you. So you might want to listen to this

1721
02:14:30,909 --> 02:14:32,829
Oh, this is to me. Yes, uh tim

1722
02:14:34,109 --> 02:14:38,590
96 give 50 more dollars and they said don't tell star this. Oh, okay

1723
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:42,260
I won't read the rest then

1724
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:51,010
I brought some people

1725
02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:54,689
By the way, uh spoiler alert. He said I am much more handsome than you

1726
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:57,600
That's fine

1727
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:02,020
I told him

1728
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:03,539
How?

1729
02:15:03,539 --> 02:15:09,310
Okay, I feel like this is cheating you're making your own final destination

1730
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:14,979
You wait there

1731
02:15:14,979 --> 02:15:16,979
You can do that, right? I can do that

1732
02:15:24,369 --> 02:15:27,819
Finally, I can see the sun

1733
02:15:27,819 --> 02:15:29,819
I could see the sun. All right. What are

1734
02:15:29,979 --> 02:15:31,979
What are this guy's mechanics? What does he do?

1735
02:15:32,699 --> 02:15:35,420
Does he you know the first worm we fought that died really quickly?

1736
02:15:35,979 --> 02:15:40,220
Yeah, uh, I guess it's it's one of those worms are like that are common enemies

1737
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:44,939
But uh, he splits into segments and he you have to like kill every single part of the worm

1738
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:50,779
Because they just keep worm that flies around so if you're above the ground it makes it a lot easier to dodge

1739
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:53,020
Because he's gonna come up at you

1740
02:15:53,659 --> 02:16:06,579
Okay, are you ready

1741
02:16:06,579 --> 02:16:08,579
I am I guess as ready as i'm gonna be

1742
02:16:10,369 --> 02:16:12,609
I'm not sure what that means, but I guess so

1743
02:16:13,729 --> 02:16:15,729
eater of worlds segments left

1744
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:18,689
57

1745
02:16:18,689 --> 02:16:20,689
That seems like a lot. Yeah

1746
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:25,250
Oh these stick to the fucking thing

1747
02:16:26,770 --> 02:16:43,360
That's him down there

1748
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:54,639
I didn't though. I'm fine

1749
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:56,639
Nice. All right. Careful. He's coming in. He's wrapping around you

1750
02:16:59,549 --> 02:17:00,590
Careful

1751
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:14,030
All right, you see now he's like 30 worms now. Yeah, he's a lot of worms gonna eat the world next

1752
02:17:40,989 --> 02:17:45,409
Oh that hurt

1753
02:17:45,409 --> 02:17:47,809
Inside of my nose is it's it's just it's ever been in my whole life

1754
02:17:49,969 --> 02:17:54,610
That's somebody put like sneezing powder in my nose they just came in here and just like blew it up in my nose

1755
02:17:58,219 --> 02:17:59,260
Is that it?

1756
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:01,950
I think that's the last one more

1757
02:18:02,430 --> 02:18:13,940
There's two segments left scratch it. I can't you did it you did it

1758
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:20,799
All right, you okay, you're like sniffing in your microphone and I really appreciate it

1759
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:24,420
So what do we get?

1760
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:27,870
Oh, hold on. This thing is actually really good

1761
02:18:30,430 --> 02:18:33,309
They were just lined up on the bridge and I could just run this way and go like that

1762
02:18:37,809 --> 02:18:39,809
Yeah, that way. Oh, yeah star the master looter

1763
02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:46,049
Every single one of those little splits drops, uh demonite ore and shadow scales make sure you picked them all up

1764
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:48,129
That's around here. Yeah, i've been running around looking around

1765
02:18:49,629 --> 02:18:52,319
on the top here

1766
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:54,879
He dropped a healing staff

1767
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:57,739
Healing staff

1768
02:18:57,739 --> 02:19:00,459
Am I doing lines of coke to be able to play terraria?

1769
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:04,049
What are you thinking?

1770
02:19:04,049 --> 02:19:06,610
What are you thinking with that nonsense?

1771
02:19:07,329 --> 02:19:09,329
Get that out of my chapel

1772
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,959
Don't do it for a lot less

1773
02:19:14,959 --> 02:19:17,920
Yeah, hey dig into hell still the title of this ring. When are we going?

1774
02:19:19,969 --> 02:19:21,969
Uh, we should be able to go now

1775
02:19:22,610 --> 02:19:25,870
So that ore you're talking about

1776
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:27,950
I have a lot of it

1777
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:29,950
Yeah, uh recall potion go back

1778
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:41,680
Come on. Okay

1779
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:45,920
So then i'm gonna give it to the jeffrey and he's gonna tell me what it does

1780
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:49,520
Okay, i've made the pickaxe so you don't need to make one

1781
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:51,120
Okay

1782
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:53,200
Yeah, okay, so I can make demonite brick

1783
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:56,299
demonite bar

1784
02:19:56,299 --> 02:19:59,379
Why would you make demonite brick?

1785
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:05,170
Just because you think it looks cool. Oh, okay. So demonite bar. I think he has a summon. That's pretty good

1786
02:20:05,170 --> 02:20:07,170
That should be a little bit better than

1787
02:20:07,489 --> 02:20:10,299
So do I have to make a bar and then put the bar in here?

1788
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:13,020
Yeah, make a bar at the furnace

1789
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,780
and then

1790
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:20,340
Here i'll drop you the shadow scales. Here's the rest of the bars. I just needed the um

1791
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:23,600
pickaxe

1792
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:25,840
And you can do whatever you want with those. Oh, okay

1793
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:32,750
There's a lot of stuff here

1794
02:20:32,750 --> 02:20:36,110
Fisher of the souls 20 more fishing power

1795
02:20:37,809 --> 02:20:39,809
There's a whole fishing thing. I've never done it

1796
02:20:40,530 --> 02:20:42,530
You would probably what the fuck is going on

1797
02:20:49,260 --> 02:20:52,899
Uh, all right, I did put the scales in trash

1798
02:20:53,860 --> 02:21:00,260
What does that mean did I accidentally trash the bars you threw the bars in the trash

1799
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:12,459
Where's the uh, don't I have demon ore still? Yeah. Oh

1800
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:15,260
Okay, if you need any more shadow skills, I have 20

1801
02:21:16,379 --> 02:21:19,659
Is there a way to quickly just go to uh, here we go

1802
02:21:21,299 --> 02:21:25,379
When you're crafting there is a button you can press that makes it show all on screen. Yeah, it's a lot easier

1803
02:21:28,989 --> 02:21:30,030
All right

1804
02:21:30,030 --> 02:21:32,030
So now i'm gonna look at this again

1805
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:38,879
I just I try to shoot him

1806
02:21:38,879 --> 02:21:40,879
jester shirt jester's mask

1807
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:44,180
minion damage, ooh

1808
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:53,620
This increases minion damage by 15 by 20 percent increases your max number of minions

1809
02:21:54,579 --> 02:21:58,340
Oh, man

1810
02:21:58,340 --> 02:22:00,350
So wait, I can do

1811
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:02,909
One two two extra minions with this set on

1812
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:08,260
Uh, yes. Yeah, this i'm gonna do this

1813
02:22:08,979 --> 02:22:15,090
How many what does this cost?

1814
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:18,290
seven defense

1815
02:22:18,290 --> 02:22:19,469
I need

1816
02:22:19,469 --> 02:22:23,090
14 bars five spirit droplets and 40 bones

1817
02:22:23,969 --> 02:22:30,159
How many materials do we cannot get those yet? And if you're seeing like some really weird items

1818
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:33,040
There's items that are animated. We cannot get those good

1819
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:34,399
No

1820
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:39,760
The I think generally speaking the further you scroll down the list the less likely we are to craft them. Oh

1821
02:22:40,479 --> 02:22:41,760
oh

1822
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:43,280
Really?

1823
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:49,760
All right, you're just gonna have to keep playing bar. No do the magic storage. We need uh emeralds before we can make a heart

1824
02:22:50,719 --> 02:22:56,110
It's bane demon bow, is there another uh, is it like a demon wand?

1825
02:22:57,469 --> 02:23:00,989
If it's not on that list there isn't one

1826
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:05,540
I think vile thorns better than what dark wave here we go dark wave

1827
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:12,100
Sends out a wave of dark energy. What does it take? Oh, I can make this 18 versus

1828
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:14,819
10

1829
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:20,450
What's the book 16?

1830
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:26,000
The book is better

1831
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,399
Fast speed versus fast speed six mana versus five

1832
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:37,620
That's not very good walking gold fishing desert star

1833
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:42,610
Yep

1834
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:44,610
16 versus 18

1835
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:47,809
I'm gonna i'll try it. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna make the uh the dark wave

1836
02:23:48,770 --> 02:23:50,770
I forgot to craft the uh

1837
02:23:57,729 --> 02:23:59,250
I need your money

1838
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:05,649
My money, what do you mean my money? Hey your gold the gold money you have I have 82 silver. I don't have very much

1839
02:24:06,610 --> 02:24:08,610
You don't have any gold pieces. No

1840
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:12,180
Do you have any dynamite?

1841
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:14,180
Uh, I have 27 bombs

1842
02:24:14,739 --> 02:24:17,620
I mean i'm gonna try this this new wand out though

1843
02:24:20,700 --> 02:24:23,629
Oh, that's pretty good it's fast

1844
02:24:25,709 --> 02:24:27,709
We need money

1845
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:36,590
And I am not joking around germa i'm gonna sell some stuff

1846
02:24:41,139 --> 02:24:43,299
Uh, what about the shadow scale? What can I do with these?

1847
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:46,180
They

1848
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:48,659
Are also used with the demonite ore i'm pretty sure

1849
02:24:49,299 --> 02:24:51,299
Just for random recipes

1850
02:24:51,299 --> 02:24:56,500
Yeah, I'm a little unsure. I think they just kind of also use those same stuff

1851
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:02,159
I just feel like I shouldn't even delete any of these things or sell any of them. I just don't know

1852
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:07,809
I'm just depositing all my shit and I don't even know what to do with it

1853
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:10,850
Buying net for the gold critters. I'll do that

1854
02:25:13,870 --> 02:25:15,469
a bug net

1855
02:25:15,469 --> 02:25:19,299
Can you catch them in a bug net?

1856
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:22,420
Can you get the duck in a bug net? Can I can you?

1857
02:25:23,219 --> 02:25:25,700
I don't know. Oh, I okay. I gotta get this in. Yeah

1858
02:25:26,659 --> 02:25:31,459
All right. What can I do with the shadow scale stuff?

1859
02:25:32,020 --> 02:25:39,379
That shit didn't

1860
02:25:39,379 --> 02:25:42,260
Uh, can you organize this stuff? I don't know what to do

1861
02:25:42,979 --> 02:25:47,620
Um, eventually we're gonna make a super stash that will auto organize it. Oh, okay

1862
02:25:48,100 --> 02:25:50,420
We just really need emerald before we can do that

1863
02:25:54,209 --> 02:25:59,700
Ruin of bleeding the only critical damage restores life

1864
02:26:00,420 --> 02:26:02,420
Can't make any of these though. I don't think

1865
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:04,219
ooh

1866
02:26:04,219 --> 02:26:05,739
ooh

1867
02:26:05,739 --> 02:26:07,540
ooh

1868
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:10,739
Sorcerer's pants sorcerer's robe. I just do much more magic damage

1869
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,120
Um, if you want better magic damage, we need to find the meteor

1870
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,360
Should I just get some of the how much should I just do these now just to have it?

1871
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:24,799
No, those are really

1872
02:26:24,799 --> 02:26:26,799
You're better off with a double jump for now

1873
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:28,159
Really?

1874
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:32,239
I think so. Yeah, I mean if you want to make them and you want to look like a wizard

1875
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:36,319
I'm not gonna stop you. I'm actually I need disciples hat

1876
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:40,690
I don't have enough

1877
02:26:40,690 --> 02:26:43,170
All right. Well, let's just let's just keep going. Let's just keep doing whatever

1878
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:47,250
Make sure I have stuff. I have food

1879
02:26:48,209 --> 02:26:50,459
Okay, I got the bug net

1880
02:26:50,459 --> 02:26:52,459
I need some more potions

1881
02:26:53,020 --> 02:27:00,829
Those are very important. How much money do I have?

1882
02:27:01,790 --> 02:27:03,790
I can buy a ton of these

1883
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:06,500
Get the 20

1884
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:09,629
20 and 20

1885
02:27:09,629 --> 02:27:11,309
Yeah, I think so

1886
02:27:11,309 --> 02:27:17,500
The disciples hat is easy to make

1887
02:27:17,579 --> 02:27:19,899
There's an upgraded version of it with one of these mods

1888
02:27:21,819 --> 02:27:28,540
And we would we would need like a loom it's like a three-step process to get to a loom to make silk to start

1889
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:32,559
If it is what I think you're talking about

1890
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:34,319
hold on

1891
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:35,840
disciples hat

1892
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:38,079
Is how can I see what that takes?

1893
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,940
I don't know

1894
02:27:40,940 --> 02:27:43,020
All right. I'm coming down. I'm gonna store this stuff

1895
02:27:43,739 --> 02:27:46,379
Wait, i'm coming back up in like one second. You're coming back up here

1896
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,540
Yeah

1897
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:50,540
I found a bunch of stuff to just sell really quick

1898
02:27:52,379 --> 02:27:54,299
I'm gonna look for a gold animal

1899
02:27:54,299 --> 02:27:58,829
And is it is it as easy as just like catching it like that?

1900
02:28:03,739 --> 02:28:09,059
Kill the pig for money

1901
02:28:09,059 --> 02:28:19,360
Really? Does it put a dot?

1902
02:28:22,659 --> 02:28:26,899
Uh, we don't need money anymore. I got it. This is a dot. I like this a lot

1903
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:44,299
I got it

1904
02:28:44,299 --> 02:28:48,190
wait

1905
02:28:48,190 --> 02:28:50,190
I just like throw him

1906
02:28:50,270 --> 02:29:00,959
Just hang on here. It's safe in here. Stop

1907
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:08,260
He's not gold so it doesn't matter

1908
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:10,260
kill pig

1909
02:29:11,440 --> 02:29:14,620
Star should we kill the pig?

1910
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:16,620
Yes, he drops bacon and a lot of money

1911
02:29:27,809 --> 02:29:29,569
You're not doing it

1912
02:29:29,569 --> 02:29:31,569
Why are you not killing this? I'm out of mana

1913
02:29:34,819 --> 02:29:36,819
I gave you a musket

1914
02:29:36,819 --> 02:29:39,780
I don't waste this thing's really powerful. You know, i'm gonna waste it on a little pig

1915
02:29:40,579 --> 02:29:42,260
the

1916
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:44,579
Yeah, I could buy you a thousand musket balls

1917
02:29:47,139 --> 02:29:52,590
That was nine gold yeah

1918
02:29:53,389 --> 02:29:54,350
What?

1919
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:56,350
Is it buy as many musket balls as you want?

1920
02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:01,040
Uh, come over here. Uh, hold on. That's a lot of money

1921
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:06,200
Sandstorm is one gold

1922
02:30:14,350 --> 02:30:18,350
Invest invest but it's a big moment step aside step aside

1923
02:30:19,469 --> 02:30:25,059
What am I doing?

1924
02:30:25,059 --> 02:30:27,340
Now we can go to hell

1925
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:29,549
What?

1926
02:30:29,549 --> 02:30:31,549
It that it's that easy to do that

1927
02:30:32,209 --> 02:30:36,239
Yeah

1928
02:30:36,239 --> 02:30:38,909
How much does that cost?

1929
02:30:38,909 --> 02:30:40,909
15 dynamite desert fossil

1930
02:30:41,709 --> 02:30:43,579
rope

1931
02:30:43,579 --> 02:30:45,579
And just go straight all the way down

1932
02:30:47,309 --> 02:30:48,190
Yeah

1933
02:30:48,190 --> 02:30:50,190
So we're just skipping the whole game

1934
02:30:50,989 --> 02:30:53,229
No, not but no not at all

1935
02:31:04,479 --> 02:31:09,469
Uh, let me block. I don't know why I like this one spot

1936
02:31:10,110 --> 02:31:12,799
What's the point of this?

1937
02:31:12,799 --> 02:31:16,700
What do you mean? We're actually the people are saying we're actually skipping the whole game

1938
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:19,420
We're not skipping the whole game

1939
02:31:21,809 --> 02:31:24,690
Uh, how do we are you sure you didn't just make a well?

1940
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:31,649
Yeah

1941
02:31:31,649 --> 02:31:33,329
You can drown in there

1942
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:42,959
We're under water right now, dude. Should we not be doing this?

1943
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,040
No, we're we're okay

1944
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,440
We need to get it to the bottom and then cut a hole in the wall

1945
02:31:47,440 --> 02:31:50,579
So the water goes out the wall so we can get it on the lava so that we can get obsidian

1946
02:31:57,899 --> 02:31:59,899
I feel not accomplished at all

1947
02:32:02,909 --> 02:32:07,579
You've dug to hell. What do you want? Can I not go anymore?

1948
02:32:08,379 --> 02:32:10,219
No, there's a bomb

1949
02:32:10,219 --> 02:32:12,979
I just got a hell forage

1950
02:32:18,209 --> 02:32:29,459
Uh, so we're just

1951
02:32:29,459 --> 02:32:31,540
Help me jerma. This is still the beginning of the game

1952
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:35,409
Don't worry

1953
02:32:35,409 --> 02:32:36,530
um

1954
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:43,629
Okay, what happened to the rope?

1955
02:32:46,159 --> 02:32:51,120
All right. Oh, so we're just gonna go down here and just mine and dig and grab things and attack. Uh,

1956
02:32:52,079 --> 02:32:55,760
Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of really annoying things that spawn and if you you see those demons on the left

1957
02:32:56,159 --> 02:32:58,159
Do them the demons on the left?

1958
02:32:59,809 --> 02:33:01,409
Come over

1959
02:33:01,409 --> 02:33:02,770
crash

1960
02:33:02,770 --> 02:33:12,139
Okay, actually there's one over here, which is the perfect example of the thing we can't do

1961
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:16,290
Okay

1962
02:33:16,290 --> 02:33:17,889
What is that exactly?

1963
02:33:17,889 --> 02:33:19,889
Do you see the demon carrying a guy?

1964
02:33:20,690 --> 02:33:22,690
Underneath his feet. Yes, I do

1965
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:27,569
Okay, if he drops that in lava or you throw that guy in lava if someone's a gigantic super

1966
02:33:28,209 --> 02:33:31,409
Wall thing monster flesh thing. We're not ready

1967
02:33:32,129 --> 02:33:34,129
Don't don't let don't kill one of those

1968
02:33:35,090 --> 02:33:36,610
over the ground

1969
02:33:36,610 --> 02:33:38,610
over lava, I mean

1970
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:41,139
Okay

1971
02:33:41,139 --> 02:33:43,139
I I guess i'll try not to do that

1972
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:45,729
Okay. Thank you

1973
02:33:45,729 --> 02:33:50,139
Did you make a demon bed?

1974
02:33:50,670 --> 02:33:55,659
Oh, I know these are all these just were in the demons houses they sleep in beds. Yeah

1975
02:33:56,379 --> 02:33:58,379
Yeah, they're upset that we're here

1976
02:34:02,610 --> 02:34:05,250
I don't think I would assume a demon did not sleep in a bed

1977
02:34:06,770 --> 02:34:10,530
I always picture them hanging upside down with their eyes open and they sleep like that

1978
02:34:11,739 --> 02:34:14,940
Nope, they get under the covers very comfortable obsidian beds

1979
02:34:15,739 --> 02:34:21,219
You cheated not only gave it yourself. You didn't grow you didn't improve you took the shortcut and you didn't gain anything

1980
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:24,739
You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked

1981
02:34:26,459 --> 02:34:28,459
And nothing was gained. Yeah, okay

1982
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:31,620
stir

1983
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:33,790
Please tell germa to get mod

1984
02:34:34,989 --> 02:34:36,690
When you're done

1985
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:40,930
I don't know. I'm just relaying the message and it doesn't matter if it made any sense or not

1986
02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:53,760
Oh because the other they're referring to the coffee pasta that was spammed like probably four or five thousand times

1987
02:34:54,719 --> 02:35:00,340
I see

1988
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:03,059
Do you have any normal blocks like placeable blocks?

1989
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:05,700
Not the blood forms

1990
02:35:07,170 --> 02:35:09,170
No, I have demon bikini

1991
02:35:09,649 --> 02:35:12,290

1995
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:32,379
Uh that teleports you to me

1996
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:34,219
Oh, that's cool

1997
02:35:34,219 --> 02:35:36,399

02:35:57,100 --> 02:36:02,829
There's a chest down there

2003
02:36:02,829 --> 02:36:04,829
Yeah, you can't open those what?

2004
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:08,030
Oh, that's unfortunate

2005
02:36:15,629 --> 02:36:18,430
Uh, i'm pretty sure that's enough. We might need one emerald

2006
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:23,040
So what's the next boss we can sell?

2007
02:36:24,799 --> 02:36:29,280
We never killed the eye, but that's like the first boss you're supposed to kill. I don't even think it's there anymore

2008
02:36:30,799 --> 02:36:31,920
um

2009
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:33,920
We can fight crab you on

2010
02:36:34,319 --> 02:36:37,840
Sounds fun to me. Let's fight crab. I don't think we have

2011
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:42,049
A way to breathe underwater

2012
02:36:42,049 --> 02:36:44,739
One of the demons dropped a sword

2013
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:48,000
And that's a piece of bacon. We could be doing the wall of flesh

2014
02:36:51,229 --> 02:36:54,670
On this job. Do you do you like do you like do you want this?

2015
02:36:56,030 --> 02:36:58,030
Blade crest oath sword

2016
02:36:58,350 --> 02:36:59,629
You're gonna die

2017
02:36:59,629 --> 02:37:01,379
What?

2018
02:37:01,379 --> 02:37:05,860
These guys shoot your walls. Oh, you're getting shot. Uh, what do you have for a sword?

2019
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:11,180
What the fuck is he gonna hit? Oh, just drop it

2020
02:37:12,739 --> 02:37:13,459
here

2021
02:37:13,459 --> 02:37:15,459
This is not the place to read things

2022
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:17,309
uh

2023
02:37:17,309 --> 02:37:19,309
Come get the oversized sword here

2024
02:37:19,549 --> 02:37:25,420
It's on the ground. Have I put it down? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2025
02:37:25,579 --> 02:37:27,579
I yeah. Yeah. You're right

2026
02:37:28,219 --> 02:37:31,489
Yeah. All right. Should we get out of here?

2027
02:37:32,700 --> 02:37:34,139
um

2028
02:37:34,139 --> 02:37:39,010
Here's what we should here here. Let's go back

2029
02:37:47,010 --> 02:37:51,010
We can you see these like uh, these cheetos on the wall cheetos on the wall?

2030
02:37:52,450 --> 02:37:54,209
Yes

2031
02:37:54,209 --> 02:37:56,209
That's magma. Oh

2032
02:37:56,850 --> 02:37:58,850
He just snuck one in

2033
02:38:08,420 --> 02:38:14,020
And then also we need to find life crystals because our max health could be like two or better under right now

2034
02:38:14,739 --> 02:38:24,770
Yeah

2035
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:26,930
Magma ore how much do you think we need?

2036
02:38:28,899 --> 02:38:32,049
Um, forget what magma armor does

2037
02:38:32,610 --> 02:38:36,930
I don't think either of us are actually really going to use this but not much. There's a chest over there

2038
02:38:44,370 --> 02:38:45,819
Um

2039
02:38:45,819 --> 02:38:49,979
Where the fuck did you come from? He lives here

2040
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:55,299
Let's take over that chest

2041
02:38:55,940 --> 02:39:08,319
Some more magma ore down here. Don't want to pass this up. What the hell is that diamond? It was a ghost

2042
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,040
What did it drop that was that?

2043
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:19,950
Uh ring stones pretty good accessory you can make with them. I forget exactly what it means. I know it needs 10 ring stones

2044
02:39:24,670 --> 02:39:27,709
What's in the chest? Uh, this is for you take one of these

2045
02:39:29,100 --> 02:39:32,459
Help me. How about how do I what do I do? What do I do? I'm on fire. What do I do?

2046
02:39:33,100 --> 02:39:37,440
You're dead

2047
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:40,639
You know what you do is you respawn you heal really quick

2048
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:43,280
and then you use your

2049
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:48,219
Wormhole potion you press m and just click on me on the map and you'll teleport to me

2050
02:39:48,860 --> 02:39:52,260
I didn't know lava was that dangerous

2051
02:39:53,899 --> 02:39:56,860
It's yeah, it's really it does like 60 damage when you first touch it

2052
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:01,659
All right, so I can teleport to you

2053
02:40:03,389 --> 02:40:04,510
and then

2054
02:40:04,510 --> 02:40:09,389
Yeah, drop off any items if you were full. I mean that demonic bone ash

2055
02:40:09,790 --> 02:40:12,989
All right, well, I don't know any we need to make like a super stash and I got a big yeah

2056
02:40:13,069 --> 02:40:15,069

2057
02:40:16,899 --> 02:40:20,659
I know that i've been putting in a lot of like actually don't waste a little potion

2058
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:24,979
You're just gonna come back up you got the sword right and end word

2059
02:40:26,719 --> 02:40:29,760
Right alongside the fucking giant hole. Anyway

02:40:35,549 --> 02:40:38,370
quick stack

2061
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:44,020
Restock sword items

2062
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:47,780
Yeah, I got a lot of just random junk in there. I don't I don't really know what happened necessarily does

2063
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:50,500
Uh, i'm gonna start setting up the thing

2064
02:40:50,979 --> 02:40:53,139
I'm gonna put it in your candy cane room. Oh, thanks

2065
02:40:54,100 --> 02:40:58,979
Uh jerem what stir is making you do is like skipping to the end levels in legend to zelda with only two hearts

2066
02:40:58,979 --> 02:41:01,790
It is not

2067
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:05,069
That was that was a real quick response to that. It is not

2068
02:41:08,899 --> 02:41:13,879
What i'm doing is like you know in diablo 2 when your friend gives you the waypoint to the catacombs

2069
02:41:16,850 --> 02:41:21,569
All right, this will make act one a little bit easier you literally have base health

2070
02:41:21,569 --> 02:41:26,239
That's what somebody said

2071
02:41:26,299 --> 02:41:27,840
literally

2072
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:29,920
literally

2073
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:31,360
literally

2074
02:41:31,360 --> 02:41:33,440
Okay

2075
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:36,879
So, um, let me take a look what I got here. Um demonic bone ash

2076
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:39,870
Are you making the super stash?

2077
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:46,209
Yeah, i'm working on it

2078
02:41:46,209 --> 02:41:50,450
Store your gold so you don't lose it next time. Oh shit. We might be missing

2079
02:41:50,610 --> 02:41:55,729
I didn't I was I didn't know you could deposit gold like I forgot it. I didn't realize it took up slot

2080
02:41:56,290 --> 02:41:58,290
I guess it does, huh?

2081
02:41:58,370 --> 02:42:03,569
Have you gotten one of those shadow diamonds by chance, I don't think we would have another yet

2082
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:06,209
shadow diamond

2083
02:42:06,209 --> 02:42:08,770
I have demonic bone ash magma ore

2084
02:42:11,069 --> 02:42:13,739
No

2085
02:42:13,739 --> 02:42:18,540
It would be in one of these chests. I just dumped everything in here. I'm sitting in table. We need to kill the eye

2086
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:21,700
I think

2087
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:24,739
the eye

2088
02:42:24,739 --> 02:42:26,739
Unless you miraculously found diamond

2089
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:32,100
No, I don't think so. It would be stuffed in one of those boxes along with

2090
02:42:33,860 --> 02:42:36,100
15 weeds take this two mushrooms

2091
02:42:37,790 --> 02:42:41,059
wild band of regeneration

2092
02:42:41,059 --> 02:42:42,979
slowly regenerates life

2093
02:42:42,979 --> 02:42:46,459
Oh plus one percent melee speed

2094
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:56,020
That's cool

2095
02:42:56,020 --> 02:42:58,260
Filling that cheater hole next to you

2096
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:02,959
So are we are we on are we out?

2097
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:09,280
Uh, I I just have to like go touch that thing really quick go touch a thing. All right, I will take

2098
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,040
I'm gonna take this opportunity to open this door

2099
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,680
To fill up a cheater hole

2100
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:23,059
I'm gonna go cover in the our cheater. I'm gonna get to put a cheater manhole on our cheater sewer

2101
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:44,000
I didn't have any wood. I thought that was a diamond for a second and I was gonna say hey I found a diamond

2102
02:43:46,420 --> 02:43:48,420
I had a kiss you

2103
02:43:48,799 --> 02:43:50,799
Waterleaf waterleaf

2104
02:43:50,879 --> 02:43:56,110
Simon's got coppa

2105
02:43:56,110 --> 02:43:57,309
Do you best?

2106
02:43:57,309 --> 02:44:04,190
Thick boston accent. I can't I don't even want to embarrass myself. I love this room, by the way where you panic and 30 torches

2107
02:44:05,149 --> 02:44:07,149
Which one

2108
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:10,750
Like every time I walk by it

2109
02:44:10,829 --> 02:44:15,469
I'm gonna remember well, I was not I was not trying to put a torch down. I was trying to hit the thing

2110
02:44:16,110 --> 02:44:18,110
I know the monster that was in there

2111
02:44:18,590 --> 02:44:20,590
But it was very scaly

2112
02:44:22,610 --> 02:44:24,610
It sure was. All right

2113
02:44:24,610 --> 02:44:26,610
With my

2114
02:44:40,959 --> 02:44:43,200
Oh my I should totally make like a bacon bridge

2115
02:44:51,069 --> 02:44:55,010
Dude I think i'm gonna i'm gonna make a like my walls are gonna be made of bacon

2116
02:45:02,930 --> 02:45:07,280
Hey cap this shit

2117
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:17,709
I missed it. I should really probably give you one of the life crystals

2118
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:21,260
You really just stopped hoarding all the items

2119
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:24,719
I just gave you a band of regeneration

2120
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:27,200
Yeah, you've probably been holding on to that

2121
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:28,579
ow

2122
02:45:28,579 --> 02:45:34,559
Is this your grave?

2123
02:45:34,559 --> 02:45:36,879
Probably extremities were detached by a zombie

2124
02:45:44,459 --> 02:45:46,459
We're the best monkey streamers

2125
02:45:52,989 --> 02:45:57,329
What are you doing?

2126
02:45:57,329 --> 02:45:59,809
Keyboard mashing is it night time? Tell me when it's night time

2127
02:46:07,149 --> 02:46:15,340
Just look outside why'd I have to tell you that i'm underground right?

2128
02:46:16,530 --> 02:46:18,370
Just look outside

2129
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:21,760
That was that was a

2130
02:46:25,440 --> 02:46:43,459
Is this your grave

2131
02:46:43,459 --> 02:47:09,420
Oh, what are you doing?

2132
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:27,500
What are you doing? Nothing. I'm sealing your fate is what i'm doing. What does that mean people that are watching my stream?

2133
02:47:27,579 --> 02:47:29,579
No, and they they know what i'm doing

2134
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:36,379
No, guys, i'm not trying to like mouse trap him by having that hit him in the head

2135
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:38,780
I was sending his gravestone to hell

2136
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:58,270
That's kind of fucked up

2137
02:47:58,270 --> 02:48:00,909
I'm bored. Okay. What am I doing up there?

2138
02:48:02,190 --> 02:48:12,129
Is it daytime?

2139
02:48:12,129 --> 02:48:18,530
Uh, is it night time? Oh fuck. It's been daytime for a very long time. No, no night time. It's it's it's dusk right now

2140
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:24,479
Is it night time? It's it's dusk. It's the sun's going down

2141
02:48:26,299 --> 02:48:35,260
Okay, why are the pics of so much health?

2142
02:48:38,110 --> 02:48:40,110
Uh, because they give so much gold and bacon

2143
02:48:40,670 --> 02:48:46,989
It's just kind of a joke, you know, you ever laugh before. Oh, right bacon like money epic bacon

2144
02:48:47,709 --> 02:49:15,780
11 gold

2145
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:18,340
That's so much. What is a huge amount of money?

2146
02:49:19,389 --> 02:49:21,549
What'd you say? What's like a what's a decent amount of money in the game?

2147
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:25,020
uh for this early like

2148
02:49:25,180 --> 02:49:28,299
30 gold is pretty solid. I mean eventually you get platinum

2149
02:49:29,500 --> 02:49:31,500
Oh gold turns into platinum

2150
02:49:32,379 --> 02:49:38,379
That's pretty awesome. But the the most expensive things will be the traveling merchant has some things that sell for like 50 gold and usually they're

2151
02:49:38,860 --> 02:49:40,940
in their goofs

2152
02:49:40,940 --> 02:49:43,440
That's cool. And then beyond that you buy

2153
02:49:43,819 --> 02:49:46,100
dynamite

2154
02:49:46,100 --> 02:49:51,459
Is like one of the more expensive things I stored my money. I got like I got like 16 gold in that

2155
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:57,120
case

2156
02:49:57,440 --> 02:50:01,040
So in the meantime, is this something I should be doing while i'm waiting for you to collect the thing to

2157
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,600
uh go do uh

2158
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:10,780
You can build a rope that goes to the sky are you just trying to like keep me occupied?

2159
02:50:11,579 --> 02:50:13,579
No, no, there's like uh

2160
02:50:14,909 --> 02:50:20,510
There's that's in the sky that's like a keep the like keep like the dumb guy occupied joke, right

2161
02:50:21,709 --> 02:50:24,979
No

2162
02:50:24,979 --> 02:50:27,299
I'm like digging underground just finding random chests

2163
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:33,540
Uh, all right, and in the sky there are planets and there are floating clouds with buildings on them. Um, all right

2164
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:35,540
That sounds pretty fun. I'm gonna go do that

2165
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:41,840
Where's like rope? How do you how do you craft rope?

2166
02:50:44,879 --> 02:50:48,319
Do you have cobweb? You know, you haven't like really been underground much

2167
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:52,420
Can you buy rope? I'm not sure

2168
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:55,540
They're so hard to find without flight

2169
02:51:00,829 --> 02:51:05,790
There's a lot more in calamity mods. So the odds of you going up and they're being a planet are actually pretty high

2170
02:51:05,870 --> 02:51:07,870
These are expensive, man

2171
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:10,829
What it's 10 copper for one?

2172
02:51:11,870 --> 02:51:13,469
That's rope nothing

2173
02:51:13,469 --> 02:51:14,989
There's nothing

2174
02:51:14,989 --> 02:51:18,620
Yeah

2175
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:20,290
Are you sure?

2176
02:51:20,290 --> 02:51:21,409
Yeah

2177
02:51:21,409 --> 02:51:23,170
That's not expensive

2178
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:30,159
Don't I need like 500 of these? That's one bullet. I don't I need I need like 500 of these

2179
02:51:42,459 --> 02:51:44,059
Okay

2180
02:51:44,059 --> 02:51:46,059
Here I have a gift for you. Do you like gifts?

2181
02:51:47,149 --> 02:51:49,069
I have a thousand rope

2182
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:50,270
Take this

2183
02:51:50,270 --> 02:51:52,430
I wanted to give you a mirror a mirror

2184
02:51:53,149 --> 02:51:56,020
What does it do?

2185
02:51:56,020 --> 02:52:00,340
It does the same thing a recall potion does but it's infinite. Oh, that's cool

2186
02:52:01,139 --> 02:52:04,909
He was never gonna tell me it was nighttime

2187
02:52:05,870 --> 02:52:10,270
I told you what I said. Hey, it's I said it's dusk. It's dusk. It's dusk

2188
02:52:10,350 --> 02:52:43,149
Like that means like it's dusk. It's gonna be nighttime in a minute. This guy's a piece of shit the eye

2189
02:52:50,209 --> 02:52:53,069
This thing's kind of a chump

2190
02:52:53,069 --> 02:52:56,190
It's it's been first boss and like normal terraria

2191
02:52:56,750 --> 02:52:58,510
Oh

2192
02:52:58,510 --> 02:53:12,180
Is there a way to um regenerate mana?

2193
02:53:13,629 --> 02:53:14,590
better

2194
02:53:14,590 --> 02:53:18,829
Than uh, there are some items later. There's a lot of stuff but not yet. Do you here?

2195
02:53:18,829 --> 02:53:22,829
I'll give you my the mana potions. I know I I already I have a bunch of like lesser mana potions

2196
02:53:22,829 --> 02:53:24,829
But is there like an effective?

2197
02:53:25,489 --> 02:53:30,930
there's ways like the the health regeneration band I gave you can be turned into a

2198
02:53:31,889 --> 02:53:35,010
Mana regen actually, I think this orb I have can make something for you

2199
02:53:36,290 --> 02:53:38,290
Stand still. Oh, look at that

2200
02:53:39,250 --> 02:53:42,780
It dropped right next to us. So did you get the thing we wanted?

2201
02:53:43,579 --> 02:53:48,059
Okay, faun star

2202
02:53:49,059 --> 02:53:51,059
Doing it we have to summon him again

2203
02:53:51,790 --> 02:53:54,909
Uh, no, I got the thing. I need it. Oh, so what were you looking for?

2204
02:53:55,790 --> 02:53:59,469
I was looking for a shadow diamond so I can start making that crafting thing

2205
02:53:59,709 --> 02:54:01,149
Okay, so I got I got three stars

2206
02:54:01,149 --> 02:54:05,549
Should I what should I use these stars or do you need them for something important? No use them

2207
02:54:06,430 --> 02:54:08,909
Do I just use them like just put them in my hotbar and use three?

2208
02:54:10,940 --> 02:54:12,940
No turn them into the mana crystal

2209
02:54:14,690 --> 02:54:16,770
Oh, you have to have to craft it like that, huh?

2210
02:54:17,729 --> 02:54:23,489
Yeah, okay in here take these two life crystals. I'm being i'm being kind i'm sharing

2211
02:54:24,209 --> 02:54:25,729
life crystal

2212
02:54:25,729 --> 02:54:28,739
So that gives me another health pool

2213
02:54:30,719 --> 02:54:32,719
It gives you 20 health per

2214
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:37,920
Why did we not do this like an hour and a half ago because you have to find them and or

2215
02:54:38,479 --> 02:54:40,719
It's just like random if you find it or not. Oh, okay

2216
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:47,149
So we could have been looking underground for him, but clearly we didn't need it

2217
02:54:47,709 --> 02:54:49,709
Because we're so strong

2218
02:54:50,430 --> 02:54:52,430
Why does the guy have a health bar did he get hurt?

2219
02:54:53,329 --> 02:54:56,239
Yeah

2220
02:54:56,239 --> 02:54:59,120
All right. So we're gonna do anything do anything else we need to do at night time

2221
02:55:00,610 --> 02:55:01,489
No

2222
02:55:01,489 --> 02:55:02,530
um

2223
02:55:02,530 --> 02:55:04,450
What's your pickaxe?

2224
02:55:04,450 --> 02:55:06,370
Uh, it's the sand

2225
02:55:06,370 --> 02:55:08,370
shameful sandstone pickaxe

2226
02:55:13,090 --> 02:55:15,090
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2227
02:55:15,170 --> 02:55:17,170
I have the same like you a demonite one

2228
02:55:17,569 --> 02:55:21,889
I mean, uh, I think I deposited them i'm depositing. I'm just putting what about the magma stuff

2229
02:55:23,620 --> 02:55:25,620
Uh, I don't think we have enough yet

2230
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:28,500
That's what see magma ore makes a magma bar, right?

2231
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:35,520
Magma factory block magma bar. You can't you can't ore mag. You can't mine magma

2232
02:55:36,639 --> 02:55:39,829
Or you definitely can't mine hellstone. So take that pickaxe

2233
02:55:41,489 --> 02:55:45,409
So this replaces this pickaxe now, I don't need this one anymore you don't need it

2234
02:55:45,569 --> 02:55:47,090
Okay

2235
02:55:47,090 --> 02:55:52,129
The sandstone pickaxe is a piece just just shell it sell it sell it garbage. All right

2236
02:55:55,819 --> 02:55:57,819
Do you have any more of that gingerbread?

2237
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:00,620
No

2238
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:03,200
the gingerbread cookie

2239
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:04,799
You know the wall

2240
02:56:04,799 --> 02:56:08,290
What do you mean? What?

2241
02:56:08,290 --> 02:56:10,290
the the candy cane

2242
02:56:10,850 --> 02:56:12,850
It's in one of these chests

2243
02:56:15,059 --> 02:56:16,579
It's in one of them

2244
02:56:16,579 --> 02:56:20,579
I got it. I've been just like panicking and throwing stuff everything I get in here

2245
02:56:22,209 --> 02:56:25,729
This is superior ball of hurt in here. It's 33 melee damage. Is that good?

2246
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:29,409
Okay, but it's

2247
02:56:29,809 --> 02:56:31,889
Okay, you you need to like fact check me here

2248
02:56:32,129 --> 02:56:35,889
You have to like check my work because i've just been throwing random stuff that I don't even know it does in there

2249
02:56:36,530 --> 02:56:48,100
So why are you making this bigger?

2250
02:56:49,059 --> 02:56:50,340
for this

2251
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:53,040
so it's nice and even

2252
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:55,040
and this is a

2253
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:58,479
This is complicated. So you make one of those

2254
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:05,360
And then you have to connect other storage components to it and then you click that and then it's basically a combined storage

2255
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,989
Very cool

2256
02:57:10,989 --> 02:57:14,270
Very cool. Do you have any lead bars on you?

2257
02:57:15,469 --> 02:57:17,700
No

2258
02:57:17,700 --> 02:57:21,059
Like I said everything but I have two pieces of bacon on me

2259
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:25,760
and like a clock

2260
02:57:25,760 --> 02:57:28,770
There's a new pig over here

2261
02:57:28,770 --> 02:57:32,750
new pig

2262
02:57:32,750 --> 02:57:34,750
Are we getting luigi'd right now?

2263
02:57:35,219 --> 02:57:39,940
Is it just spawning us pigs because hey you've been standing still for 15 straight minutes you might need a pig

2264
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:42,659
They actually spawn a lot when you're above ground

2265
02:57:55,250 --> 02:57:58,530
Oh, dude, do you have any wood is there wood in there? You got any threes?

2266
02:57:59,250 --> 02:58:01,250
Dude, you got no fish

2267
02:58:02,219 --> 02:58:03,420
uh

2268
02:58:03,420 --> 02:58:06,620
So we should just go down and explore someone said just explore

2269
02:58:07,659 --> 02:58:10,159
Said you're doing a whole lot of nothing

2270
02:58:10,319 --> 02:58:12,319
I need to make this thing

2271
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:17,860
And then we can do something

2272
02:58:17,860 --> 02:58:22,739
You just got all of that. I just like deposited that into your bank. All right. Thank you. Why don't we just go explore?

2273
02:58:27,860 --> 02:58:29,860
I'm going to i'm going up to hell

2274
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:33,120
Going up to hell. Oh go

2275
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:38,590

02:58:38,590 --> 02:58:41,149
Wait this fall damage uh shooting star to spell to the left

2277
02:58:41,790 --> 02:58:48,670
How high do you need to go?

2278
02:58:48,670 --> 02:58:52,350
Uh, you can actually go all the way up to like space and it'll be low gravity

2279
02:58:53,149 --> 02:58:55,149
What and there can still be planets up there?

2280
02:58:56,110 --> 02:58:58,110
Am I gonna get attacked by something?

2281
02:58:58,110 --> 02:58:59,149
Yes

2282
02:58:59,149 --> 02:59:00,510
Yes, okay

2283
02:59:00,510 --> 02:59:02,510
Harpies that's like it

2284
02:59:03,979 --> 02:59:11,469
ooh

2285
02:59:11,469 --> 02:59:16,079
What is that star?

2286
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:21,040
Star star I found something star. I found uh, what's the merlin sword? Excalibur?

2287
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:25,840
What's the thing that merlin is strong enough to pull out of the stone sword in the stone? Excalibur? It's right up here

2288
02:59:27,569 --> 02:59:30,319
Pull it out

2289
02:59:30,319 --> 02:59:33,139
How of your hand?

2290
02:59:39,819 --> 02:59:41,180
I I can't

2291
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:42,700
Can I dig it out?

2292
02:59:42,700 --> 02:59:46,819
Do I have to dig it?

2293
02:59:46,819 --> 02:59:48,819
I do. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got

2294
02:59:49,139 --> 02:59:52,299
Archilus?

2295
02:59:52,299 --> 02:59:57,520
Oh, no

2296
02:59:57,520 --> 02:59:59,760
I'm falling did I use my?

2297
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
No, I'm not. Oh, you got it

2298
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:08,459
You oh

2299
03:00:08,459 --> 03:00:11,579
Can I see it? Like I think you might have found the broken weapon

2300
03:00:14,590 --> 03:00:17,790
I'm worried if you want if it is what I think it is. Is that it?

2301
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:23,469
uh

2302
03:00:23,469 --> 03:00:25,469
Okay. No, this is not what I thought it was

2303
03:00:28,219 --> 03:00:32,639
It's not it's not

2304
03:00:32,639 --> 03:00:34,719
It makes the thing that I thought it was

2305
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:37,360
But it is not that thing

2306
03:00:37,360 --> 03:00:42,639
So we just need to hold on to that. So it is the thing. It's it's like the thing. It's a it's a part to the thing

2307
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:47,760
So what should I do with this

2308
03:00:48,579 --> 03:00:53,620
Uh, hold up. Hold on. I'm gonna explain in one second. I just went straight into the sky in love with me

2309
03:00:56,399 --> 03:00:59,280
That was just a random shot. I just went right in the air. Did it come over here?

2310
03:01:01,620 --> 03:01:05,059
You right click on the green thing the green cross. Yes

2311
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:11,459
And you get that's our super storage that has 160 slots and you can search the name of things, okay

2312
03:01:12,579 --> 03:01:16,899
You just put everything in there. So take everything from these chests is just going in there

2313
03:01:17,620 --> 03:01:21,940
Yeah, if you don't know what something is just dumping it just dump them

2314
03:01:22,739 --> 03:01:24,739
Just dump it. Okay

2315
03:01:31,500 --> 03:01:34,780
Use the fucking sword. Holy shit, man. Who is streaming out of my okay?

2316
03:01:45,180 --> 03:01:47,819
Actually most items that we're not already using you can sell

2317
03:01:48,780 --> 03:01:53,250
It's like a lot of junk like mandible bow and ice blades

2318
03:01:55,549 --> 03:01:57,549
If you look at an item actually

2319
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:04,540
All the weapons that can be crafted into other weapons say material on them. If it doesn't say material then just sell it

2320
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:08,459
Uh, I i've just i'm just depositing everything in here

2321
03:02:09,659 --> 03:02:11,659
Okay, you know, that's fine, too

2322
03:02:12,219 --> 03:02:14,860
So arkylus should I use it?

2323
03:02:15,739 --> 03:02:17,739
Is it i'm not like melee person though

2324
03:02:18,700 --> 03:02:20,059
You shouldn't

2325
03:02:20,059 --> 03:02:21,420
I shouldn't

2326
03:02:21,420 --> 03:02:24,700
Should not don't get self-conscious because your chat tells you to do something

2327
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:26,540
I remember when they told me to use doors

2328
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:29,659
They remember when they said the problem with those rooms was that there weren't doors

2329
03:02:30,139 --> 03:02:35,899
I mean, we're talking about a literal 100 unanimous. Everyone is saying yes at the same time

2330
03:02:38,059 --> 03:02:40,590
You don't what?

2331
03:02:40,590 --> 03:02:42,899
Why am I not going to use this?

2332
03:02:42,899 --> 03:02:45,700
No, just don't even use it. Do you see how fast this is?

2333
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:47,780
Don't use this

2334
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:49,709
I think chat

2335
03:02:49,709 --> 03:02:56,190
Like if chat's not okay with the the dig the thing to hell. I don't think they can be okay with you using that sword

2336
03:02:56,270 --> 03:02:58,270
You're a mage, right?

2337
03:03:01,459 --> 03:03:06,209
Yeah, I mean that's so fast

2338
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:11,840
I feel like I would kill things in two seconds

2339
03:03:14,690 --> 03:03:17,250
Oh, i'm gonna play with my new toy outside. This is great

2340
03:03:18,209 --> 03:03:22,239
All right. What are we doing? You want to go you want to go exploring?

2341
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:28,079
Yes

2342
03:03:28,159 --> 03:03:31,360
Okay, you know how fast yeah, you know how fast i'll be able to kill the pig with this

2343
03:03:33,059 --> 03:03:50,479
I'll show you

2344
03:03:50,479 --> 03:03:52,479
You don't want to use this

2345
03:03:52,479 --> 03:03:55,500
You you can do whatever you want

2346
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:59,979
I'm gonna use it sometimes

2347
03:03:59,979 --> 03:04:10,110
This would be my close range. But all right, uh, let's let's go explore. Let's go do something

2348
03:04:10,829 --> 03:04:16,829
I've been kind of i've been really just housebound here for the last like 20 minutes. We're we're going to go look for

2349
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:22,219
Uh life crystals and just chest

2350
03:04:22,860 --> 03:04:25,100
Life crystals and chests should we fall all the way down?

2351
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:30,670
Or stop like stop and then go to the other half way. It's like you catch up to me

2352
03:04:31,469 --> 03:04:38,110
actually

2353
03:04:38,110 --> 03:04:41,870
The crab guy's in this area, which is the next boss we would be doing

2354
03:04:43,069 --> 03:04:46,079
But we would need

2355
03:04:46,079 --> 03:04:50,879
A way to breathe underwater

2356
03:04:50,959 --> 03:04:53,899
I think we had gills potions

2357
03:04:53,899 --> 03:04:55,020
Did we?

2358
03:04:55,020 --> 03:04:58,100
Well, you know, oh I went by you. Oh stop falling

2359
03:05:00,159 --> 03:05:02,159
Actually come back up. Yeah, we'll start here

2360
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:07,180
Left or right matter

2361
03:05:07,180 --> 03:05:12,590
Just going in left. This is a gold portal

2362
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:16,239
Luke get

2363
03:05:16,239 --> 03:05:17,600
That's my thing

2364
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,600
I see up there this thing

2365
03:05:20,510 --> 03:05:23,709
This is a life crystal you mine it and then you use the life crystal

2366
03:05:24,190 --> 03:05:26,500
Oh

2367
03:05:26,500 --> 03:05:28,899
Oh

2368
03:05:28,899 --> 03:05:35,200
So they just randomly around here. Yeah, they're just they're just out and about

2369
03:05:36,819 --> 03:05:39,059
Damn, um actually also with these mods

2370
03:05:40,340 --> 03:05:43,219
Actually, no, we need to get the max health first before we do that. Oh never mind

2371
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:49,459
I'm just gonna go this way should I there's like water over here. Is that a bad idea?

2372
03:05:49,940 --> 03:05:52,340
Uh, it's a bad idea to spend that much time mining

2373
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:54,819
I was just digging down because there's a bunch of open area over here

2374
03:05:59,709 --> 03:06:01,709
You I have a spelunky potion

2375
03:06:03,170 --> 03:06:06,879
Don't waste that yet

2376
03:06:10,670 --> 03:06:11,870
I mean

2377
03:06:11,870 --> 03:06:14,270
It depends how long do you are how long you're gonna play?

2378
03:06:15,709 --> 03:06:18,909
I don't know

2379
03:06:18,909 --> 03:06:20,909
Because they become very useful later on

2380
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:26,979
How many bombs I have a lot of bombs I think

2381
03:06:27,700 --> 03:06:31,540
Should I just start throwing them?

2382
03:06:31,540 --> 03:06:35,620
No, I I when I did the the mass depositing I got rid of all of them

2383
03:06:37,010 --> 03:06:41,620
Ah, let's go the same way come over here

2384
03:06:42,340 --> 03:06:50,260
You're underwater. I know

2385
03:06:50,819 --> 03:06:52,819
There's a air pocket

2386
03:06:54,860 --> 03:06:56,860
Where is there an air pocket?

2387
03:06:56,940 --> 03:06:58,219
Over here

2388
03:06:58,219 --> 03:07:00,399
Are we gonna drown before?

2389
03:07:04,350 --> 03:07:09,520
Sorry, I couldn't see it my game was a trillion degrees too dark

2390
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:17,280
I'm trying degrees. Yeah, i'm out of torches. I didn't flying ahead. Oh, you're almost dead. I'm gonna fucking die

2391
03:07:18,780 --> 03:07:22,959
No, i'm not. I'm fine

2392
03:07:22,959 --> 03:07:25,600
Occasionally there's some traps. I don't know who set them up

2393
03:07:26,159 --> 03:07:28,159
Just don't smooth cold

2394
03:07:29,729 --> 03:07:31,729
Yeah, forget what that actually makes

2395
03:07:31,729 --> 03:07:39,889
I'm just gonna keep going this way. What there's like a little spot to drop down here

2396
03:07:40,610 --> 03:07:48,420
I'm not gonna drown us or anything right if I drop this down here with you

2397
03:07:50,979 --> 03:07:52,100
No

2398
03:07:52,100 --> 03:07:54,659
That's definitely not enough water to drown anybody, but it could be

2399
03:07:57,120 --> 03:07:58,719
Fuck dude

2400
03:07:58,719 --> 03:08:00,159
You all right?

2401
03:08:00,159 --> 03:08:02,319
Yeah, I accidentally lobbied myself

2402
03:08:06,620 --> 03:08:08,540
Don't get bothered

2403
03:08:08,540 --> 03:08:25,569
Oh shit, that's right

2404
03:08:25,569 --> 03:08:26,989
jest

2405
03:08:26,989 --> 03:08:28,989
Actually, we haven't had a blood moon yet

2406
03:08:29,069 --> 03:08:31,069
That holds us back from all this stuff

2407
03:08:32,190 --> 03:08:35,469
Silver bar jester's arrow spiked cloud in a bottle

2408
03:08:36,270 --> 03:08:40,110
Dad, oh dad come look at this stuff. Let's go. Look at that. I don't know what it is

2409
03:08:46,370 --> 03:08:52,209
Cloud in a bottle is basically one of these jump like an extra jump so you can do spin and then a

2410
03:08:52,770 --> 03:08:55,790
a third jump

2411
03:08:55,790 --> 03:08:58,430
All right. Do you want it? I just took everything

2412
03:08:59,229 --> 03:09:02,829
I took the cloud in the bottle. I was saying you could do you'll get more use out of it

2413
03:09:09,149 --> 03:09:10,190
Okay

2414
03:09:10,190 --> 03:09:20,620
I'm gonna have a lot of stone

2415
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:39,940
It's mine frank tonight

2416
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:47,809
Where are you going?

2417
03:09:47,809 --> 03:09:57,489
Nothing up here

2418
03:09:57,489 --> 03:09:59,569
Uh, so skeleton drops something over there. I think

2419
03:10:00,209 --> 03:10:20,739
to the right

2420
03:10:20,739 --> 03:10:22,860
Thank you, man

2421
03:10:22,860 --> 03:10:33,569
I didn't mean it that way. You're welcome. We're silver. What do you got?

2422
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:36,780
Bomb, okay. I got bombs

2423
03:10:36,780 --> 03:10:41,280
You want to start throwing them around?

2424
03:10:41,280 --> 03:10:43,280
Oh, I got a runestone

2425
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:55,200
Should I just stop dropping bombs? Am I muted like

2426
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:57,520
I you didn't say it

2427
03:10:57,520 --> 03:10:59,520
whoops, uh

2428
03:11:01,420 --> 03:11:07,579
Sure, I was gonna have a long answer. I'm just sure well the reason why you probably shouldn't do that

2429
03:11:08,059 --> 03:11:13,100
But if you're going down you should just throw bombs down and then they all fall down in a line

2430
03:11:13,100 --> 03:11:15,100
And it's much faster than a pickaxe

2431
03:11:15,260 --> 03:11:17,260
There's there's

2432
03:11:17,579 --> 03:11:19,819
If you're like going sideways

2433
03:11:20,940 --> 03:11:23,420
I'm just gonna drop them down. I have like three so i'm just gonna throw them down

2434
03:11:24,540 --> 03:11:26,909
Okay, I hope they land on me

2435
03:11:27,870 --> 03:11:30,590
How much damage does the bomb do if you if it lands directly on your head?

2436
03:11:31,629 --> 03:11:36,379
I don't know

2437
03:11:36,379 --> 03:11:39,100
Not dropping bombs on my head too often like 80 maybe

2438
03:11:40,059 --> 03:11:49,170
Oh fuck oh my god 246 for a fall maybe

2439
03:11:59,649 --> 03:12:01,649
I thought you were closer

2440
03:12:01,649 --> 03:12:09,040
I thought you were closer. I didn't I thought there was a platform down where you were. I didn't think it was just fall. Fuck

2441
03:12:10,260 --> 03:12:12,340
Uh drop bombs not yourself

2442
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:17,180
No

2443
03:12:17,180 --> 03:12:18,780
Damn it

2444
03:12:18,780 --> 03:12:20,700
It's okay. I got all your money. Did you?

2445
03:12:21,979 --> 03:12:23,979
Yeah, okay good

2446
03:12:26,579 --> 03:12:29,379
I don't worry soon. We're gonna be playing hardcore mode on expert

2447
03:12:30,340 --> 03:12:33,979
All right, everything's a figure biceps are

2448
03:12:35,020 --> 03:12:37,020
They used to be pretty big. All right, so

2449
03:12:37,340 --> 03:12:38,299
um

2450
03:12:38,299 --> 03:12:40,479
You keep your items though, right?

2451
03:12:40,559 --> 03:12:41,600
Yep

2452
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:46,639
tin ore bomb

2453
03:12:46,639 --> 03:12:51,229
Rune dirt block and we just got such a bunch of just shit

2454
03:13:01,180 --> 03:13:03,180
Uh, let me put the mirror back

2455
03:13:07,229 --> 03:13:10,670
Don't you put the mirror back? I don't think i've even had it

2456
03:13:12,700 --> 03:13:15,870
Oh

2457
03:13:16,590 --> 03:13:17,870
Stacks

2458
03:13:17,870 --> 03:13:19,709
default storing

2459
03:13:19,709 --> 03:13:23,090
Where is it?

2460
03:13:23,090 --> 03:13:24,530
filter all

2461
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:27,010
Just search a mirror. Oh, I can just type it

2462
03:13:30,620 --> 03:13:32,620
So what what does this thing do again?

2463
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:35,899
It's a recall potion and I can I can I recall to you

2464
03:13:36,860 --> 03:13:39,260
No, no, it always goes back to your bed. Okay

2465
03:13:46,579 --> 03:13:48,579
All right. I'm gonna use

2466
03:13:50,850 --> 03:13:53,489
Where the bombs i'm gonna bring some i'm just gonna throw them down near you

2467
03:13:54,209 --> 03:13:56,690
You actually do have a wormhole potion so you can teleport to me

2468
03:13:56,770 --> 03:14:01,020
Okay

2469
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:06,299
Wormhole potion what do they look like you just press m on the map then click on my icon underground

2470
03:14:07,739 --> 03:14:12,059
Do I have to use the potion or just does it consume one? It'll auto use the potion when you click on me

2471
03:14:12,620 --> 03:14:14,620
If you have one, yeah, I don't think I have one

2472
03:14:15,739 --> 03:14:21,739
No, I don't have one and it's in the box

2473
03:14:24,110 --> 03:14:27,459
Uh

2474
03:14:27,459 --> 03:14:29,620
I don't think we have any

2475
03:14:31,250 --> 03:14:33,250
Wormhole. Oh, all right. We got one. We got one

2476
03:14:34,850 --> 03:14:36,610
All right coming back

2477
03:14:39,809 --> 03:14:41,809
Okay

2478
03:14:42,530 --> 03:14:44,770
Okay, this is for you I got another cloud in the bottle

2479
03:14:45,889 --> 03:14:49,250
So that so equip this shit and now I can

2480
03:14:50,049 --> 03:14:51,409
double jump

2481
03:14:51,409 --> 03:14:54,209
Again, I have to triple one two three one two three

2482
03:14:56,739 --> 03:15:04,340
Very cool. All right

2483
03:15:04,659 --> 03:15:07,700
Is there something specific besides life crystals we're looking for here?

2484
03:15:09,120 --> 03:15:11,739
um chests

2485
03:15:11,899 --> 03:15:14,219
and life crystals that's about it red husk and

2486
03:15:15,020 --> 03:15:19,500
Any kind of gemstone if we come across it is also helpful because we don't have hooks yet

2487
03:15:21,100 --> 03:15:28,379
That's my bird i'm just safe without the bird

2488
03:15:29,260 --> 03:15:34,829
Oh, and we found the mushroom kingdom

2489
03:15:36,659 --> 03:15:38,659
Which is also helpful

2490
03:15:38,659 --> 03:15:41,340
Because there's a boss we can summon in here

2491
03:15:41,979 --> 03:15:43,649
we can

2492
03:15:43,649 --> 03:15:46,290
I'm like too tall if I have a glowing crystal

2493
03:15:47,540 --> 03:15:50,340
Or glowing mushrooms then you can summon a boss in here

2494
03:15:56,799 --> 03:15:58,959
chats talking politics in the chat

2495
03:16:00,219 --> 03:16:03,180
Stop it. Let's get political. Stop it

2496
03:16:04,399 --> 03:16:06,399
What about hillary's emails?

2497
03:16:06,479 --> 03:16:10,379
Don't act

2498
03:16:10,379 --> 03:16:13,420
Oh, that's a nice point you have there. But what about hillary's emails?

2499
03:16:14,379 --> 03:16:16,379
Oh like right above us is topaz

2500
03:16:18,340 --> 03:16:20,399
topaz

2501
03:16:20,399 --> 03:16:21,680
Yeah

2502
03:16:21,680 --> 03:16:23,680
15 of any gemstone gives you

2503
03:16:24,079 --> 03:16:26,079
A hook and hooks are very good

2504
03:16:26,879 --> 03:16:43,299
Where do we go now? So where should we go now down here?

2505
03:16:44,100 --> 03:16:46,659
I'm just placing torches. I'm holding shift

2506
03:16:47,620 --> 03:16:56,829
Be aware of that

2507
03:16:56,909 --> 03:17:10,620
You're freaking me out. I don't like this doesn't go that far

2508
03:17:11,870 --> 03:17:17,659
um

2509
03:17:17,659 --> 03:17:19,659
I hate we don't have the dryad yet

2510
03:17:22,879 --> 03:17:26,909
too scary

2511
03:17:26,909 --> 03:17:28,030
Can you do it?

2512
03:17:28,030 --> 03:17:32,030
Probably not mario maker. Can you do it? Oh easy. He's a pro

2513
03:17:32,590 --> 03:17:38,159
I played mario maker a few times so you're not you're not wrong

2514
03:17:39,569 --> 03:17:41,569
Should we dig down this way around here?

2515
03:17:42,610 --> 03:17:44,610
I feel like we're getting too low

2516
03:17:45,170 --> 03:17:48,690
Too low there's some really good chests that appear at this level

2517
03:17:49,489 --> 03:17:53,329
There's like a band that makes you immune to lava for seven seconds. Should we go this way?

2518
03:17:55,620 --> 03:17:57,860
Uh, how many bombs do you have a lot?

2519
03:17:59,360 --> 03:18:01,360
I'd just start dropping them

2520
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:08,030
Okay

2521
03:18:08,030 --> 03:18:10,030
much faster than that

2522
03:18:10,750 --> 03:18:13,309
Not not one at a time you're not too worried about what's gonna happen

2523
03:18:14,750 --> 03:18:16,510
All right, well watch out watch out

2524
03:18:16,510 --> 03:18:35,540
What's that?

2525
03:18:35,540 --> 03:18:41,059
Uh, those combine into life crystals if you get 10 of them really how do we get it? How can we give it a lava?

2526
03:18:42,100 --> 03:18:44,659
Uh, just blow it up. Just keep blowing shit up

2527
03:18:50,559 --> 03:18:52,450
I just blew them up

2528
03:18:52,450 --> 03:19:07,569
They're still in there

2529
03:19:07,569 --> 03:19:10,159
So we're

2530
03:19:10,159 --> 03:19:12,340
Keep going down

2531
03:19:12,340 --> 03:19:23,010
Yeah

2532
03:19:23,010 --> 03:19:24,750
Keep doing this

2533
03:19:24,750 --> 03:19:27,069
Keep going. I only have like eight bombs left

2534
03:19:31,790 --> 03:19:34,270
All right. That's enough. Oh my god. Oh my god. What what?

2535
03:19:35,870 --> 03:19:38,590
I'm down there. I know but I you told me to keep doing it

2536
03:19:39,389 --> 03:19:51,739
Well, okay, that's enough that's enough more bomb him more

2537
03:19:52,379 --> 03:20:02,219
I'm gonna go this way. I don't have any bombs. Those are grenades

2538
03:20:07,059 --> 03:20:09,059
You like really don't like working together

2539
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:12,590
We kind of like wherever I dig isn't good enough for you

2540
03:20:14,590 --> 03:20:16,590
It's not yeah, no, it's not

2541
03:20:17,469 --> 03:20:34,110
control

2542
03:20:34,110 --> 03:20:38,340
I did it already. I think I found something

2543
03:20:39,440 --> 03:20:40,959
platinum ore

2544
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:44,510
platinum

2545
03:20:44,510 --> 03:20:48,430
Good, I don't think it's really useful for us anymore. Demonite is better and we have a lot

2546
03:20:49,469 --> 03:20:59,010
Did we skip everything?

2547
03:20:59,010 --> 03:21:02,270
All right, so we're i'm above you

2548
03:21:02,350 --> 03:21:04,030
So i'm in hell

2549
03:21:04,030 --> 03:21:10,590
Do we go back up?

2550
03:21:10,590 --> 03:21:14,940
uh

2551
03:21:14,940 --> 03:21:16,940
Yeah, I have a lot of stuff I can put away

2552
03:21:18,399 --> 03:21:22,750
How do we sum up the next boss?

2553
03:21:23,790 --> 03:21:28,159
That's how hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

2554
03:21:39,729 --> 03:21:44,930
Uh, we could go to the beach and fight the giant jellyfish, which I don't even give us anything beach we need

2555
03:21:45,889 --> 03:21:49,950
It's all the way on the left side of the map very very long walk

2556
03:21:56,620 --> 03:21:58,620
And it will be a pain in the neck

2557
03:22:01,860 --> 03:22:05,139
Wait, what's going on people arguing in chat sub only?

2558
03:22:05,860 --> 03:22:07,540
Oh, I know what we can do

2559
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:22,290
We should be discussing terraria strategies

2560
03:22:33,420 --> 03:22:38,770
One moment, then I have a plan go caving

2561
03:22:41,700 --> 03:22:45,299
We just did some caving didn't we just go caving

2562
03:22:54,219 --> 03:22:55,659
camera mode

2563
03:22:57,520 --> 03:22:59,920
All right, should I just get rid of this book? I feel like i'm not using it at all

2564
03:23:01,889 --> 03:23:03,680
Uh, sure

2565
03:23:03,680 --> 03:23:09,120
You're gonna, you know, stop using things a lot and you don't have to ask my permission. Yeah, but yeah

2566
03:23:10,239 --> 03:23:12,239
I know but you're the most

2567
03:23:12,719 --> 03:23:15,200
You're the most addressable person right now

2568
03:23:15,760 --> 03:23:18,239
Okay, you know what? I understand. I apologize for being

2569
03:23:20,719 --> 03:23:22,719
Abrasive

2570
03:23:22,719 --> 03:23:24,719
You're very abrasive right now

2571
03:23:26,079 --> 03:23:28,079
Hey, what video is that from?

2572
03:23:28,559 --> 03:23:35,340
Hey get that a star right there you're gonna get that star

2573
03:23:36,059 --> 03:23:42,430
I'm selling something

2574
03:23:42,430 --> 03:23:46,030
I am gonna get that and i'm gonna use it because I think I have three now because I have one

2575
03:23:46,750 --> 03:23:48,350
star

2576
03:23:48,350 --> 03:24:02,079
No, I have two

2577
03:24:02,079 --> 03:24:06,959
Two enemies are nearby. What are these uh, two like tesla, uh cannon things?

2578
03:24:09,340 --> 03:24:14,459
Uh one is so you can make furniture out of snow and one is so you can make stuff out of slime

2579
03:24:15,340 --> 03:24:17,219
or gel

2580
03:24:17,219 --> 03:24:19,540
How do I take it off? So how do you take a room off sub only?

2581
03:24:22,209 --> 03:24:24,209
Slash subscribers, I think

2582
03:24:31,420 --> 03:24:40,559
How do I turn it off subscribers off why does it feel like that means I delete everybody

2583
03:24:42,610 --> 03:24:46,530
Subscribers are subscribers are removed from the channel

2584
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:02,559
Hey, hey, wait, what did it? What did my wife say?

2585
03:25:06,510 --> 03:25:07,950
Where's uh

2586
03:25:07,950 --> 03:25:09,309
Where is it?

2587
03:25:09,309 --> 03:25:12,270
Here I have three things for you. How the fuck do I do this?

2588
03:25:13,069 --> 03:25:17,329
I don't even know how to like I don't even know how to fucking turn it off on my own damn channel

2589
03:25:18,209 --> 03:25:22,500
Am I about to google how to turn off sub only and get mods?

2590
03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:31,200
Don't tell him how to do that

2591
03:25:32,700 --> 03:25:44,750
Yeah, i'm searching for it. Okay, how to turn off sub only twitch

2592
03:25:46,959 --> 03:25:48,959
How do you turn off sub only chat?

2593
03:25:51,250 --> 03:25:54,899
It's likely visual bug

2594
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:57,440
Subscribers off they would write

2595
03:25:57,520 --> 03:25:59,600
All right, everybody behave yourselves

2596
03:26:00,829 --> 03:26:02,829
I somebody did

2597
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:09,129
Behave

2598
03:26:09,129 --> 03:26:12,170
Don't no more. I don't want to I don't hear about any politics talk

2599
03:26:14,680 --> 03:26:16,680
Don't let star talk about like

2600
03:26:17,260 --> 03:26:18,940
hillary's emails

2601
03:26:18,940 --> 03:26:24,860
Germa thinks his stream is more important than the future of america. I don't want to hear about the damn emails anymore. Okay?

2602
03:26:25,659 --> 03:26:29,600
The whole entire country is sick of hearing about your email talk about

2603
03:26:30,079 --> 03:26:34,399
This importance of all of our futures and where it's headed talk about me instead

2604
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:38,399
All right. So wait, what are we doing? What's what's going on?

2605
03:26:47,209 --> 03:26:48,969
two one

2606
03:26:48,969 --> 03:26:52,250
Zero the countdown come to the right. All right. Are you summoning a boss?

2607
03:26:53,049 --> 03:26:57,370
Uh, there's two bosses. We're gonna fight two bosses. Are you gonna summon those bosses two summoning stones?

2608
03:26:57,770 --> 03:27:00,489
Straight above us is a planet with a giant bee in it. Got it

2609
03:27:01,450 --> 03:27:03,819
Okay, so go up

2610
03:27:05,020 --> 03:27:09,979
Uh, did you take all the ropes that I had I had like a thousand where we're going up we're going up bone rope

2611
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:13,719
this is uh

2612
03:27:14,840 --> 03:27:16,840
Ah, you wouldn't appreciate that

2613
03:27:17,319 --> 03:27:20,270
I just threw up a bomb in here

2614
03:27:24,170 --> 03:27:26,170
I'm helping i'm helping i'm helping i'm helping

2615
03:27:27,719 --> 03:27:30,440
Okay. So once we dig inside of this, yeah

2616
03:27:31,399 --> 03:27:33,639
Of the bee queen or whatever will spawn

2617
03:27:37,290 --> 03:27:39,129
This is a bee queen

2618
03:27:39,129 --> 03:27:42,170
She's similar to the bird we fought where she dashes left and right at you

2619
03:27:42,649 --> 03:27:44,649
But also she shoots a lot of things. Hey

2620
03:27:45,850 --> 03:27:54,040
Okay, so okay. So we're probably going to fight her

2621
03:27:55,420 --> 03:27:58,159
on the ground

2622
03:27:58,159 --> 03:28:00,159
So go down after we summon

2623
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:03,600
Yeah, or fight her on the rope

2624
03:28:10,700 --> 03:28:12,700
Well, I don't if you want to fight her on the rope

2625
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:15,500
Queen bee is spun. All right, so just be careful, right?

2626
03:28:16,379 --> 03:28:22,409
It's just like contra

2627
03:28:22,409 --> 03:28:23,850
She's gonna hurt

2628
03:28:23,850 --> 03:28:26,350
There's a contra level just like this

2629
03:28:39,100 --> 03:28:41,100
All right. Well, she's

2630
03:28:41,180 --> 03:28:42,620
Oh

2631
03:28:42,620 --> 03:28:50,920
Add a mana add a mana

2632
03:28:54,649 --> 03:28:56,969
What okay, I guess the best you can do is stand still

2633
03:28:57,930 --> 03:29:00,090
I'll wait for you. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good

2634
03:29:00,969 --> 03:29:06,969
I got mana back

2635
03:29:07,450 --> 03:29:10,329
I think you would get a lot of enjoyment from the bee items

2636
03:29:11,899 --> 03:29:13,899
ow fuck

2637
03:29:14,700 --> 03:29:17,899
Hold on I can potion in four seconds

2638
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:20,139
That's a lie

2639
03:29:20,139 --> 03:29:31,340
I just missed don't die. Oh my god

2640
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:35,180
I

2641
03:29:51,180 --> 03:29:53,180
It just I need mana

2642
03:29:53,500 --> 03:29:55,500
I run out of mana that I just

2643
03:29:55,959 --> 03:30:00,840
Stick my fingers in my eyes. I gave you a fucking musket. This doesn't cost mana

2644
03:30:04,969 --> 03:30:08,489
Okay, actually, no, this is this is what you want. Trust me. I think you're gonna love this

2645
03:30:09,819 --> 03:30:11,260
Take this

2646
03:30:11,260 --> 03:30:15,440
We're going step by step take this as long as you're shooting wooden arrows

2647
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:20,799
So like make sure your your ammo on the right isn't like flaming arrows or something. You shoot a line of bees

2648
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:28,440
I'm gonna get as much did you pick up my money?

2649
03:30:29,629 --> 03:30:30,750
I did

2650
03:30:30,750 --> 03:30:40,639
Okay, jerma

2651
03:30:40,639 --> 03:30:43,520
I'm not done with yes. What is it? I'm paying attention

2652
03:30:44,159 --> 03:30:48,559
Take this i'm downloading an entire class into my brain in the first day of school

2653
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:55,200
Okay, jerma take you're the teacher and i'm sitting in a fucking chair and hey, welcome to the first day. Here's the syllabus

2654
03:30:55,280 --> 03:31:04,799
Oh, by the way, uh, here's every single test do it now. It's a lot jerma. It's a lot. I know

2655
03:31:05,600 --> 03:31:14,379
All right, what do you want me to do with this as long as that's in your inventory other bees are friendly to you

2656
03:31:14,459 --> 03:31:18,860
Which is only in the jungle. It's up to you if you want to waste inventory space on it. I'll keep it

2657
03:31:19,340 --> 03:31:21,340
Okay, and this you take this

2658
03:31:21,819 --> 03:31:23,819
If you get hit bees come out of you

2659
03:31:26,200 --> 03:31:27,559
All right

2660
03:31:27,559 --> 03:31:29,079
Okay, and this

2661
03:31:29,079 --> 03:31:35,399
What do you get hit it feels damaged everything around you which will actually hit every segment of a worm. It's pretty good early

2662
03:31:36,280 --> 03:31:39,229
Okay, take this

2663
03:31:39,870 --> 03:31:42,030
That'll increase your minion damage where

2664
03:31:44,600 --> 03:31:46,700
Okay

2665
03:31:46,700 --> 03:31:49,899
Equip material equipment equipable. Where does it equip to?

2666
03:31:50,860 --> 03:31:52,299
uh

2667
03:31:52,299 --> 03:31:55,200
Underneath the armor the slots are all for accessories

2668
03:31:57,899 --> 03:32:00,520
And I think that's it

2669
03:32:00,520 --> 03:32:02,520
I would highly recommend use of that bow

2670
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:05,319
Uh, um, yeah, i'm gonna i think i'm gonna give it a try

2671
03:32:05,959 --> 03:32:12,200
Especially because all these once they come out they become homing and they just follow everything and then you just like you can read your chat

2672
03:32:12,280 --> 03:32:14,280
And become a boomer

2673
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:23,920
So, what what does it use for um

2674
03:32:24,670 --> 03:32:28,030
For wooden arrows turned into a column of vehicles wooden arrows

2675
03:32:28,750 --> 03:32:30,989
So I don't need I don't need like cobweb anymore

2676
03:32:32,799 --> 03:32:37,840
Uh cobweb turns into rope. You might as well just turn it all into a rope. Okay, so I need wooden arrows

2677
03:32:39,850 --> 03:32:41,850
You know here I have 400

2678
03:32:42,639 --> 03:32:46,000
Okay, i'll take 400 arrows you're gonna want more let me check

2679
03:32:46,079 --> 03:32:48,079
Let me test this out

2680
03:32:55,020 --> 03:33:01,040
They're saying you didn't get the money

2681
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:03,360
I have 21 gold. Oh, there is gold over there

2682
03:33:12,250 --> 03:33:15,930
Yeah, you can just have it that that that's like that's like my like fuck face fee

2683
03:33:16,010 --> 03:33:18,409
You know what I mean? Like that's yours. Like I you could have it

2684
03:33:19,209 --> 03:33:27,979
What okay, but queen bee

2685
03:33:28,379 --> 03:33:31,420
Discouraged the giant insects are they can prove useful in certain situations?

2686
03:33:32,299 --> 03:33:35,959
Giving the ability to control them placing your image and make all small bees weak

2687
03:33:37,079 --> 03:33:41,879
All small bees and weak hornets friendly. I have two of these though. I don't do I need does it make them extra friendly?

2688
03:33:41,959 --> 03:33:43,959
Oh, no. No, you don't need both

2689
03:33:44,120 --> 03:33:48,200
And again bees really only exist in the jungle, but it's probably a waste inventory spot

2690
03:33:48,280 --> 03:33:51,639
But I thought you know, maybe you'd get into the whole bee thing. So what's a strange plant?

2691
03:33:53,159 --> 03:33:55,159
Uh garbage

2692
03:33:58,889 --> 03:34:00,489
bee nade

2693
03:34:00,489 --> 03:34:10,059
All right, that's kind of cool

2694
03:34:10,059 --> 03:34:11,020
feather

2695
03:34:11,020 --> 03:34:13,020
Deposit this stuff avian cartilage

2696
03:34:13,819 --> 03:34:16,639
Do you have any more? Um stars

2697
03:34:18,750 --> 03:34:21,180
I have one

2698
03:34:21,180 --> 03:34:23,260
You can trade the strange plant for dye. That's cool

2699
03:34:26,110 --> 03:34:28,110
You have one can I have it or do you need it?

2700
03:34:28,110 --> 03:34:30,110
Uh, it's daytime. I can't give it to you

2701
03:34:30,969 --> 03:34:32,250
oh

2702
03:34:32,250 --> 03:34:39,360
Right. I don't think i'm gonna use

2703
03:34:40,079 --> 03:34:41,920
Maybe I will

2704
03:34:41,920 --> 03:34:43,920
No, i'll use this i'll try it

2705
03:34:45,709 --> 03:34:48,729
Try what?

2706
03:34:48,729 --> 03:34:50,729
That bow if you're not gonna use it

2707
03:34:51,129 --> 03:34:55,690
I'll use the bow but i'm talking about the vine. Should I get to replace the bow with the vine?

2708
03:34:56,250 --> 03:34:58,969
You know what I mean? What's the vine? Oh vile thorn. Yeah

2709
03:35:01,260 --> 03:35:06,540
Nah, keep vile thorn keep vile thorn and just when you run out of mana just shoot bees

2710
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:16,299
What do I do with it?

2711
03:35:16,299 --> 03:35:18,219
I guess i'll put it up here

2712
03:35:18,219 --> 03:35:24,030
I like dark wave though. I like the dot

2713
03:35:26,000 --> 03:35:28,000
Uh, I think magma ore

2714
03:35:28,159 --> 03:35:30,639
Actually makes them a good fire spell

2715
03:35:31,760 --> 03:35:34,510
I think we actually have enough to do it

2716
03:35:34,829 --> 03:35:40,319
So what's next on the agenda?

2717
03:35:40,319 --> 03:35:43,520
You can hear me, right? Yeah

2718
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:46,110
Okay, i'm gonna make you this

2719
03:35:46,110 --> 03:36:00,670
spam

2720
03:36:00,670 --> 03:36:02,670
Never mind. I don't know how to make it

2721
03:36:03,069 --> 03:36:05,819
Let me ask jeffery

2722
03:36:05,819 --> 03:36:08,620
Jeff, how do you do this? It might be hellstone actually

2723
03:36:11,260 --> 03:36:16,540
I wonder if I get hellstone. Let me look at this again. Okay, five percent increase minion knockback damage

2724
03:36:17,579 --> 03:36:23,629
So it regenerates health. I want like a i've won a bunch of mana regeneration

2725
03:36:25,549 --> 03:36:27,549
Uh, then we need to find the meteorite

2726
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:36,700
Because that gives you an armor set that reduces the cost of spells mana

2727
03:36:37,739 --> 03:36:39,739
And gives extra magic damage

2728
03:36:42,200 --> 03:36:45,879
All right, I just send it flying. All right. Well, what what's the second boss that you wanted to do?

2729
03:36:47,370 --> 03:36:50,409
Uh, we have to go back to the corruption. There's another boss we can fight there

2730
03:36:51,370 --> 03:36:54,719
You wanna do it?

2731
03:36:54,719 --> 03:36:56,559
Can I pee first? Yeah

2732
03:36:56,559 --> 03:37:00,559
Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Why don't you it's been like four hours. Why don't you go on a pee break, too?

2733
03:37:01,200 --> 03:37:07,920
No, i've never peed before. Okay. How how often do you like when you stream how long do you stream usually?

2734
03:37:08,959 --> 03:37:12,719
Like five or six hours lately six hours like maybe five to eight hours something like that

2735
03:37:13,280 --> 03:37:18,079
Yeah, how many times do you go pee in like a seven and a half hours? I don't I don't get up

2736
03:37:18,319 --> 03:37:20,319
You do not get up. I don't

2737
03:37:21,280 --> 03:37:23,360
I've had like 12 hour streams where i've not peed

2738
03:37:24,079 --> 03:37:25,760
Are you drinking water?

2739
03:37:25,760 --> 03:37:29,760
Yes, ever since I was a child. It's one of my you know, one of my past times you go to the toilet

2740
03:37:30,079 --> 03:37:35,520
You have to make sure you remember to count how long you're peeing. I've told you this before. I know I have yeah told everyone

2741
03:37:36,959 --> 03:37:38,959
What's your longest pee?

2742
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:41,040
my longest pee ever

2743
03:37:41,360 --> 03:37:44,799
Well, it was probably like it was probably like 45 seconds and then it stopped

2744
03:37:45,360 --> 03:37:49,920
And then I thought it was over and then another full like probably 35 seconds

2745
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:53,280
after stoppage like stopping

2746
03:37:54,559 --> 03:37:59,479
For at least five straight seconds, then it doesn't count. No, it does. It's the same. It's actually continuous

2747
03:38:00,440 --> 03:38:02,440
That's the same session. You don't leave the urinal

2748
03:38:04,110 --> 03:38:09,629
Well, see because the problem then becomes if if you're allowed to stop then a whole bunch of people would be stopped start

2749
03:38:09,790 --> 03:38:13,629
Stop, and then you get like an extended. Well, that doesn't happen all the time. That's only happening like twice

2750
03:38:13,629 --> 03:38:16,219
continuously

2751
03:38:16,219 --> 03:38:21,579
My the longest pee i've ever had it continuously where i've just been looking down going what the fuck is happening

2752
03:38:22,540 --> 03:38:23,899
Whoa

2753
03:38:23,899 --> 03:38:25,899
was

2754
03:38:26,299 --> 03:38:31,100
No, you you have that reaction because where does it go if you pee for 60 straight seconds

2755
03:38:31,819 --> 03:38:33,979
How what where is that shit inside you?

2756
03:38:35,180 --> 03:38:38,219
Your bladder is not that big you're peeing out like a whole body full of pee

2757
03:38:39,559 --> 03:38:43,399
That's like two 32 ounce gatorade bottles like that can't fit in there

2758
03:38:44,360 --> 03:38:48,239
You're right i'm laughing because you're right

2759
03:38:50,620 --> 03:38:55,420
Uh, probably like I don't know 50 60 seconds, maybe tops you can't go for that long

2760
03:38:56,379 --> 03:38:59,389
But uh, all right, whatever i'll be right back

2761
03:39:00,110 --> 03:39:02,479
Give me a second and tell me more

2762
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:06,750
I'm gonna be muted on my stream, but not on your stream

2763
03:39:07,309 --> 03:39:09,309
Okay, yes, I when we hear the okay

2764
03:39:09,950 --> 03:39:17,879
BRB

2765
03:39:17,879 --> 03:39:23,260
Well, it's just me and you guys

2766
03:39:24,059 --> 03:39:38,479
Okay, okay, I understand I understand okay, I understand it's all clear now

2767
03:42:35,739 --> 03:42:42,280
All right, just out of the way unmute you or prison, uh, dude

2768
03:42:43,319 --> 03:42:45,629
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello

2769
03:42:46,569 --> 03:42:48,569
Hi, hello. Hello. Hello

2770
03:42:49,129 --> 03:42:52,139
Hello

2771
03:42:52,139 --> 03:42:57,979
All right. So what have you got done in the my absence? Oh you made like I made some rooms

2772
03:42:58,940 --> 03:43:02,059
You made a little another section. This is a science section

2773
03:43:04,159 --> 03:43:06,159
indeed

2774
03:43:06,159 --> 03:43:10,590
Okay. All right. You ready?

2775
03:43:10,590 --> 03:43:13,790
I'm gonna head out. I guess yeah, what do you want to do the other boss?

2776
03:43:14,510 --> 03:43:16,350
other boss

2777
03:43:16,350 --> 03:43:18,350
other boss

2778
03:43:23,840 --> 03:43:26,479
What is this one is the jellyfish boss you're talking about

2779
03:43:27,440 --> 03:43:28,719
No

2780
03:43:28,719 --> 03:43:30,879
This boss is the hive mind

2781
03:43:34,479 --> 03:43:35,360
So

2782
03:43:35,360 --> 03:43:39,690
Is it big? Is it cool? Is it scary?

2783
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:43,040
Uh, it's kind of a blob

2784
03:43:43,600 --> 03:43:47,280
And then you destroy the blob and then there's a phase two and then it's a floating blob

2785
03:43:49,270 --> 03:43:51,270
introduction of uh faces

2786
03:43:53,479 --> 03:43:55,479
I've seen that before

2787
03:43:55,559 --> 03:44:00,110
It's obviously you cannot defeat reddit

2788
03:44:03,680 --> 03:44:06,799
Well, I would agree normally that guess you cannot defeat reddit

2789
03:44:07,760 --> 03:44:09,760
What about hillary's email?

2790
03:44:15,360 --> 03:44:20,159
We had we had we had moved on it was already over we had moved on from that

2791
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:24,590
Because all right, you do realize that when you say that

2792
03:44:25,389 --> 03:44:27,389
Everyone like laughs like oh

2793
03:44:28,829 --> 03:44:30,430
Yeah

2794
03:44:30,430 --> 03:44:32,430
Yeah, that was but what about them though?

2795
03:44:34,780 --> 03:44:38,299
And then it's just and then it just becomes like a politics chat

2796
03:44:40,440 --> 03:44:46,280
Well, then then you have to look deep within yourself again and figure out if you're more important than the future of america

2797
03:44:47,159 --> 03:44:49,159
And then if you should stifle the conversation

2798
03:44:51,239 --> 03:44:54,040
I guess yes. I apologize for restarting it

2799
03:44:58,620 --> 03:45:02,430
Okay, we're in the corruption. We are looking for remember

2800
03:45:02,430 --> 03:45:06,909
There's that thing on the ground before and you're like, what's this? And I was like don't shoot it. It's a cyst

2801
03:45:07,389 --> 03:45:09,389
It grows on the ground

2802
03:45:11,309 --> 03:45:13,950
And then when we destroy that it summons the boss and I hope we can beat it

2803
03:45:15,069 --> 03:45:18,430
That's kind of how it goes. So would you say would you say it is some kind of?

2804
03:45:19,469 --> 03:45:21,469
sis lord

2805
03:45:21,629 --> 03:45:25,790
I don't get a reference. You've never seen

2806
03:45:28,719 --> 03:45:31,629
Like a sith lord

2807
03:45:31,629 --> 03:45:33,629
Like like a star. Oh, here's one

2808
03:45:34,590 --> 03:45:35,629
Yes

2809
03:45:35,629 --> 03:45:37,629
Like don't die, please

2810
03:45:38,030 --> 03:45:40,030
I'm but I need I need help

2811
03:45:40,879 --> 03:45:43,360
I'm not I don't think i'm capable of doing this on my own make ropes

2812
03:45:44,000 --> 03:45:46,000
I don't think I have any you took them all

2813
03:45:46,079 --> 03:45:48,600
Well, no, no, no

2814
03:45:48,600 --> 03:46:04,860
I'm good. Okay. I don't know. I'm fine. Help me

2815
03:46:05,819 --> 03:46:07,819
Help me climb this hole

2816
03:46:10,059 --> 03:46:12,239
I don't want to hear about those emails

2817
03:46:12,239 --> 03:46:17,209
All right, are you ready? What do you mean? Are we gonna go up go up when it first spawns?

2818
03:46:17,290 --> 03:46:19,690
It's like stationary. I'm just gonna chuck bombs at it

2819
03:46:22,059 --> 03:46:24,059
Just chuck but I have like b bombs

2820
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,079
So are we fighting this in any particular place?

2821
03:46:32,920 --> 03:46:34,840
um

2822
03:46:34,840 --> 03:46:36,760
Just around

2823
03:46:36,760 --> 03:46:37,979
Okay

2824
03:46:37,979 --> 03:46:39,979
And its move set is

2825
03:46:41,450 --> 03:46:43,450
I honestly don't know. It's really

2826
03:46:44,010 --> 03:46:47,850
It's like the lamest move set of any boss and doesn't really do anything

2827
03:46:48,809 --> 03:47:02,719
Whoa, you came out of here you see it's just kind of there now is the second phase

2828
03:47:02,719 --> 03:47:04,719
I think it does what the brain does

2829
03:47:06,239 --> 03:47:10,879
Like teleports around and then comes at you again, but never gets near you

2830
03:47:12,639 --> 03:47:15,260
And it goes

2831
03:47:16,860 --> 03:47:36,379
Ohio I think that's what it's saying which is uh, well, you know why a lot of damage numbers

2832
03:47:53,840 --> 03:47:55,120
Okay

2833
03:47:55,120 --> 03:47:57,120
How would you explain this move set?

2834
03:47:58,879 --> 03:48:01,360
Now that you've seen it you like get like I didn't know what to say

2835
03:48:02,000 --> 03:48:06,079
What the move set? Yeah, like you said once it's move set and I didn't know what to say

2836
03:48:07,819 --> 03:48:09,819
Uh, yeah, it's just kind of

2837
03:48:10,860 --> 03:48:13,579
It just it just kind of exists and moves around the circle

2838
03:48:14,299 --> 03:48:15,260
Yeah

2839
03:48:15,260 --> 03:48:18,379
And then something it turns into another thing that moves around the circle

2840
03:48:19,260 --> 03:48:20,459
Yep

2841
03:48:20,459 --> 03:48:21,659
That's the one

2842
03:48:21,659 --> 03:48:27,020
It gives us a true shadow scales which you can craft with demonite bars and I do not remember what it makes

2843
03:48:27,659 --> 03:48:29,659
It's not at all hive mine

2844
03:48:31,959 --> 03:48:36,360
So did you did you get anything interesting? I didn't really get I got like this. I just got

2845
03:48:37,239 --> 03:48:39,479
I got true shadow scales for crafting and

2846
03:48:40,200 --> 03:48:41,559
throwing weapons

2847
03:48:41,559 --> 03:48:46,120
Place in your inventory for all your projectiles to inflict cursed flames when in the corruption

2848
03:48:47,239 --> 03:48:52,489
the hive mine

2849
03:48:52,489 --> 03:48:57,290
Wait all projectiles in the crump. That's pretty cool. Yeah, as long as you're in this area, so like

2850
03:48:58,170 --> 03:49:02,969
So does that have to be like in my hot bar or just in my backpack in your inventory anywhere? Okay

2851
03:49:04,090 --> 03:49:07,770
So when I shoot somebody with this they get like burnt. Well, that's awesome. Yeah

2852
03:49:08,969 --> 03:49:10,489
That's pretty good

2853
03:49:10,489 --> 03:49:16,479
Are we good? Is this another one? Yeah, let's do one more

2854
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:20,760
Just in case shadow skills do make something good because I don't remember

2855
03:49:21,639 --> 03:49:48,889
Oh god, i'm stuck down here. It's tim allen noise

2856
03:49:49,850 --> 03:50:14,479
Is it though kind of is I think we need to go

2857
03:50:15,870 --> 03:50:16,989
go

2858
03:50:16,989 --> 03:50:18,909
To the beach

2859
03:50:18,909 --> 03:50:21,920
Did he drop would drop something?

2860
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:26,159
Uh, he dropped a staff for you. It's pretty decent. Did he here?

2861
03:50:26,879 --> 03:50:28,879
Let me see that thing

2862
03:50:29,200 --> 03:50:32,879
Shadow drop staff. I think that's not what I thought it was actually

2863
03:50:33,840 --> 03:50:39,020
Summons dark or rain from the sky

2864
03:50:43,399 --> 03:50:45,399
Let him get the drops. I I should

2865
03:50:47,879 --> 03:50:49,079
So just

2866
03:50:49,079 --> 03:50:51,079
It's just a rain projectile

2867
03:50:51,159 --> 03:50:53,159
Yeah, all those bullets deal damage

2868
03:50:53,959 --> 03:50:56,920
That's actually that's pretty good. I think i'd rather have this than um

2869
03:51:00,190 --> 03:51:07,149
There's there's one of those that you can make with a hellstone which we can mine down in hell except the projectiles go through the ground

2870
03:51:08,110 --> 03:51:10,829
So because like if you're underground that rain doesn't do anything

2871
03:51:12,030 --> 03:51:14,030
Oh, really?

2872
03:51:14,350 --> 03:51:17,709
Well, it'll come from the top of your screen. It's also kind of hard to see

2873
03:51:18,670 --> 03:51:20,840
I can't really tell like exactly where it's going

2874
03:51:21,319 --> 03:51:26,569
I think it's just because where you are in the background is purple. All right, so we're just porting back, right?

2875
03:51:27,530 --> 03:51:28,489
Yeah

2876
03:51:28,489 --> 03:51:43,629
I love watching derma progress in this game from an insignificant caterpillar to a big beautiful slightly more competent caterpillar

2877
03:51:45,370 --> 03:51:47,450
Okay, i've got the i've got the real deal for you

2878
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:51,280
Yeah, I guess

2879
03:51:52,799 --> 03:51:55,360
You got the real deal for me

2880
03:51:55,760 --> 03:51:59,180
I gotta hold on

2881
03:51:59,180 --> 03:52:02,440
Uh, did you ever give me that star?

2882
03:52:02,440 --> 03:52:06,440
Nope, I have five of them now I can ask you

2883
03:52:08,120 --> 03:52:09,799
I thought you can't do that

2884
03:52:09,799 --> 03:52:11,799
You can do that with the blue ones. Oh

2885
03:52:13,049 --> 03:52:17,290
All right. What I need to change my hot bar a little bit here. This is kind of a mess

2886
03:52:20,190 --> 03:52:22,040
I fuked up

2887
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:24,040
You have to crap. These are the demon altar

2888
03:52:24,959 --> 03:52:26,959
I forget that every time

2889
03:52:27,120 --> 03:52:30,719
So should I just be putting my gold in here too in the big box?

2890
03:52:35,180 --> 03:52:37,180
Uh, yes, no reason not to

2891
03:52:37,260 --> 03:52:43,559
I'm gonna make some more torches

2892
03:52:43,559 --> 03:52:45,079
And all right

2893
03:52:45,079 --> 03:52:47,719
I think it's time to make a change here

2894
03:52:51,309 --> 03:52:53,309
I gotta go make you an item. So i'll be back

2895
03:52:57,899 --> 03:52:59,899
This is called I like this b thing

2896
03:53:01,290 --> 03:53:03,370
This can just it's a one use essentially

2897
03:53:04,729 --> 03:53:12,989
Keep the apples over here

2898
03:53:14,270 --> 03:53:16,510
All right, I like that little setup

2899
03:53:17,149 --> 03:53:19,149
If you press the item in an empty space

2900
03:53:20,430 --> 03:53:22,430
So you don't have to put it in the hot bar

2901
03:53:24,440 --> 03:53:32,540
If you believe me like if I just if I click this it'll just use it

2902
03:53:41,149 --> 03:53:43,739
Thank god. He's learning it

2903
03:53:43,739 --> 03:53:45,739
No, click outside of the inventory

2904
03:53:48,079 --> 03:53:50,079
Oh, I see. Okay. I see what you mean

2905
03:53:51,870 --> 03:53:53,870
So if I click on let's say this I just

2906
03:53:55,629 --> 03:53:57,739
No, hello

2907
03:53:57,739 --> 03:54:01,069
To use items like the mirror you don't need to put them in your hot bar instead

2908
03:54:01,069 --> 03:54:04,430
You pick them up from your inventory then left click outside

2909
03:54:05,229 --> 03:54:07,149
Oh cool

2910
03:54:07,850 --> 03:54:10,329
So hold on for instance like a healing potion I just

2911
03:54:11,129 --> 03:54:13,850
All right. I get you. I get you. I get you. I got it. I got you

2912
03:54:14,649 --> 03:54:16,030
This is lady

2913
03:54:16,030 --> 03:54:26,270
I'm gonna make some more rope

2914
03:54:27,629 --> 03:54:29,629
And some more torches

2915
03:54:30,600 --> 03:54:32,600
Did you figure out what you could do with the uh?

2916
03:54:33,239 --> 03:54:36,600
Stuff that we just made i'll be back in a second. I'm making the stuff for you

2917
03:54:37,639 --> 03:54:39,639
Making the stuff for you

2918
03:54:40,479 --> 03:54:41,600
Thanks

2919
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:44,090
You know how sometimes I have trouble

2920
03:54:45,520 --> 03:54:47,520
You're a real friend here

2921
03:54:48,000 --> 03:54:50,719
Uh, take this it's a new summon. It's not a bird

2922
03:54:52,299 --> 03:54:54,350
and this

2923
03:54:54,350 --> 03:54:56,909
uh

2924
03:54:56,909 --> 03:54:59,870
This and this dank creeper to fight for you and then yeah

2925
03:55:00,190 --> 03:55:02,190
Yeah, get the freaking dank creeper

2926
03:55:02,350 --> 03:55:07,389
So can I have can I use both these to get like together with the bird and the dank you have one minion slot?

2927
03:55:08,879 --> 03:55:11,049
What's better bird or dank?

2928
03:55:11,049 --> 03:55:13,930
Uh dank is better. They their type of summons

2929
03:55:15,209 --> 03:55:17,209
Seeks out enemies a little bit better

2930
03:55:17,209 --> 03:55:20,170
Their AI is better even though their damage is not that different

2931
03:55:21,049 --> 03:55:23,049
so what's the dark wave or

2932
03:55:24,229 --> 03:55:26,229
Shadarian stuff

2933
03:55:27,450 --> 03:55:30,729
Shade rain shade rain. Yeah, come use that outside

2934
03:55:32,090 --> 03:55:34,090
I want to make sure what I think

2935
03:55:37,959 --> 03:55:42,110
okay, yeah, so you have you have one minion slot and

2936
03:55:43,850 --> 03:55:45,930
I think those count as a sentry slot

2937
03:55:48,479 --> 03:55:50,959
Yeah, so you can have two sentries in the clouds count as sentries

2938
03:55:50,959 --> 03:55:53,120
So they just kind of sit there and they they pour rain

2939
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:58,959
So if like there's a boss just you know, get those clouds above it and does a lot of damage because each drop is a projectile

2940
03:55:59,040 --> 03:56:00,559
So what the hell does it?

2941
03:56:00,559 --> 03:56:03,360
Someone's a dank creeper to fight. Where's my dank creeper?

2942
03:56:03,440 --> 03:56:08,159
You have to go to the top left and unsummon your bird to be able to summon something new. Oh, okay

2943
03:56:10,959 --> 03:56:13,520
And that thing's better just the stuff. Oh, yeah clouds are

2944
03:56:14,079 --> 03:56:16,000
My never mind

2945
03:56:16,000 --> 03:56:18,299
So I'm gonna have two clouds out at the same time

2946
03:56:19,020 --> 03:56:21,360
Yep

2947
03:56:21,360 --> 03:56:23,600
I don't like this this thing moves around too much. She's annoying

2948
03:56:28,799 --> 03:56:33,360
All right. I guess i'll just be place stuff and aoe guy

2949
03:56:36,760 --> 03:56:38,760
And I have the b thing. Okay

2950
03:56:41,159 --> 03:56:43,159
All right. Um, I think i'm good to

2951
03:56:44,430 --> 03:56:48,750
We can fight the slime god, but i'm not sure if we're ready

2952
03:56:50,489 --> 03:56:52,489
Don't know if you're ready to fight the slime god

2953
03:56:52,729 --> 03:56:55,100
What do I have potions?

2954
03:56:57,659 --> 03:57:02,840
Hmm

2955
03:57:02,840 --> 03:57:12,959
That's enough you should place down clouds and switch to your other weapons. Don't need to unequip your other staff

2956
03:57:14,479 --> 03:57:17,020
Yeah, that's true

2957
03:57:17,020 --> 03:57:19,049
That's very true

2958
03:57:19,049 --> 03:57:21,049
So essentially it's my rotation would be

2959
03:57:22,250 --> 03:57:23,370
uh

2960
03:57:23,370 --> 03:57:26,600
like two

2961
03:57:26,600 --> 03:57:28,600
two three four

2962
03:57:30,700 --> 03:57:32,700
Yeah, okay, and then five

2963
03:57:38,239 --> 03:57:40,239
Because this would be a setting up. Hold on. Let me see

2964
03:57:41,559 --> 03:57:45,799
I don't know

2965
03:57:45,799 --> 03:57:50,440
Get the clouds out switch to here throw it out there get it out bang bang bang

2966
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:55,319
Wait for the overpower to proc get it guaranteed crit switch back inner rage

2967
03:57:56,440 --> 03:57:59,530
Okay, bang bang

2968
03:57:59,530 --> 03:58:02,110
we can

2969
03:58:02,110 --> 03:58:04,110
Prepare to fight the slime god

2970
03:58:04,190 --> 03:58:06,700
It's kind of hard

2971
03:58:06,700 --> 03:58:10,700
Or we can prepare to fight the wall of flesh which will change the whole world into heart

2972
03:58:11,500 --> 03:58:13,500
Which will open up a lot of new things

2973
03:58:15,719 --> 03:58:21,040
or

2974
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:23,040
Can hold down this button from massive aoe

2975
03:58:23,840 --> 03:58:30,030
Or we can go look for the meteorite. That's how we can get you meteor armor

2976
03:58:31,799 --> 03:58:34,120
And then there's also a boss we can summon with meteorite

2977
03:58:34,760 --> 03:58:39,959
All right. What's the what's the the the progression from here, you know, what's the oh, no

2978
03:58:39,959 --> 03:58:42,600
Don't just like make a well and go to the bottom of hell

2979
03:58:43,319 --> 03:58:46,639
What would you say is? Okay. Here's like the next step

2980
03:58:47,840 --> 03:58:53,040
All of those were very good next steps doing the only thing is the little wall of flesh will

2981
03:58:54,000 --> 03:58:57,840
Turn it into hard mode. It doesn't stop you from doing the bosses, but it's kind of

2982
03:58:59,440 --> 03:59:04,000
If you want to do everything before you change it to hard mode, that would be the last thing you do. Okay

2983
03:59:04,719 --> 03:59:09,760
Well, I would say because you want to be caster guy we need to find where the meteorite landed

2984
03:59:09,760 --> 03:59:14,239
But I have no idea. I think we just have to walk right and I know how much you hate walking, right?

2985
03:59:18,750 --> 03:59:23,549
Eventually you can actually like create minecart tracks and stuff about you torches. I only have 31 torches

2986
03:59:24,430 --> 03:59:26,350
I have seven

2987
03:59:26,350 --> 03:59:28,350
Probably probably should make some

2988
03:59:30,159 --> 03:59:31,120
uh

2989
03:59:31,120 --> 03:59:33,120
Do we have materials in here for this?

2990
03:59:33,360 --> 03:59:37,389
The torch is in here. What is what is it wood?

2991
03:59:38,190 --> 03:59:40,190
uh gel and platforms

2992
03:59:40,350 --> 03:59:44,760
I don't think we have any gel do we

2993
03:59:44,920 --> 03:59:47,129
I'm just gonna make a shit look

2994
03:59:47,129 --> 03:59:49,629
We do. All right. I'm just gonna make a bunch

2995
03:59:50,969 --> 03:59:57,200

04:00:23,079 --> 04:00:32,010
How long can I stay like this forever forever? What?

3002
04:00:35,979 --> 04:00:38,540
Yes

3003
04:00:40,540 --> 04:00:43,950
Okay, thank you for giving me my first sona

3004
04:00:45,600 --> 04:00:46,959
No problem

3005
04:00:46,959 --> 04:00:48,959
You can see your first sona. Yes it is

3006
04:00:49,600 --> 04:00:54,399
All right, wooden flat not wood wood. Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. I see what you mean

3007
04:00:55,120 --> 04:01:13,229
All right, pause that and then we can go

3008
04:01:13,790 --> 04:01:22,219
I'm ready

3009
04:01:22,219 --> 04:01:27,209
Where'd you go? I'm coming. You went I went to space. Why'd you go space?

3010
04:01:28,729 --> 04:01:32,219
I was waiting. Oh, I need my mirror too

3011
04:01:41,579 --> 04:01:43,579
Sometimes you just go to space

3012
04:01:43,959 --> 04:01:45,229
All right

3013
04:01:45,229 --> 04:01:46,030
so

3014
04:01:46,030 --> 04:01:48,700
What's happening?

3015
04:01:48,700 --> 04:01:51,979
Are we ready for this?

3016
04:01:51,979 --> 04:01:57,579
Uh, what do I say we were doing? We were going really far. You said you go really far right to find the meteor

3017
04:01:58,219 --> 04:02:04,430
Okay, while we're there

3018
04:02:04,829 --> 04:02:06,829
Actually, no, we can't do it on the right

3019
04:02:07,309 --> 04:02:10,270
We'll figure it out. You know, it's a journey together. Yes it is

3020
04:02:23,420 --> 04:02:26,940
Can you eventually get in a fast travel or car or something to go here fast

3021
04:02:27,180 --> 04:02:33,360
I was gonna say you can set up minecart tracks. There's also like redstone like there's in minecraft. You can set up a teleporter

3022
04:02:34,319 --> 04:02:40,639
Uh, there's also boots that make you sprint but we have not found any of them and the cobbler has not arrived because he's an asshole

3023
04:02:43,329 --> 04:02:45,329
It's gonna be nighttime. Is it a bad thing or a good thing?

3024
04:02:46,049 --> 04:02:48,049
It doesn't matter doesn't matter

3025
04:02:48,770 --> 04:02:51,250
also, eventually you get yeah, there's mounts and they're

3026
04:02:52,129 --> 04:02:54,610
Um wings that are pretty fast

3027
04:02:59,120 --> 04:03:05,090
Cool

3028
04:03:05,090 --> 04:03:07,649
So I know when you make when you make a new minecraft seed

3029
04:03:08,450 --> 04:03:11,489
It's oh 30 times the size of earth

3030
04:03:12,450 --> 04:03:14,450
How many times the size of earth?

3031
04:03:14,850 --> 04:03:18,049
is terraria

3032
04:03:18,049 --> 04:03:20,290
Uh, i'm gonna i'm gonna say 600 times

3033
04:03:26,819 --> 04:03:28,899
I'm gonna say actually we should abandon earth

3034
04:03:29,780 --> 04:03:31,780
And just live in terraria

3035
04:03:31,940 --> 04:03:33,940
Upload our brains in here

3036
04:03:37,200 --> 04:03:39,520
He uh, somebody's calling us a dean dingus

3037
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:43,840
They're saying build more rooms you dean dinguses

3038
04:03:44,799 --> 04:03:47,760
Yeah, now they're right. But building rooms is the most boring part

3039
04:03:49,620 --> 04:03:53,620
Here's the trick here. I want to show you I can't do moves. How do I get out of this?

3040
04:03:54,180 --> 04:03:57,229
Oh, okay trick

3041
04:03:57,229 --> 04:03:58,030
um

3042
04:03:58,030 --> 04:04:00,030
So this this room pre-exists

3043
04:04:01,469 --> 04:04:03,469
Okay, where is there? Uh

3044
04:04:04,270 --> 04:04:05,549
I need a chair

3045
04:04:05,549 --> 04:04:11,229
What you do is you take someone stupid like the painter that you never want to talk and then you force him to live way out here

3046
04:04:11,709 --> 04:04:13,389
Why?

3047
04:04:13,389 --> 04:04:16,780
So that the rooms in your base free up

3048
04:04:19,549 --> 04:04:21,549
But I don't have a chair to place in here

3049
04:04:22,350 --> 04:04:24,350
Painter all the way over here

3050
04:04:26,610 --> 04:04:28,610
But does why would he have an axe?

3051
04:04:28,610 --> 04:04:29,899
I do

3052
04:04:29,899 --> 04:04:31,979
Can you chop down these trees?

3053
04:04:32,860 --> 04:04:34,139
Yeah

3054
04:04:34,139 --> 04:04:37,620
Like I can handle it

3055
04:04:37,620 --> 04:04:41,389
What do you need these chopped down for you need the wood?

3056
04:04:41,950 --> 04:04:45,149
Yeah, so I can I can make a chair and force the painter to live in exile

3057
04:04:45,950 --> 04:04:47,950
Normally, I build them like on the planets

3058
04:04:51,729 --> 04:04:53,250
pet snow owl

3059
04:04:53,250 --> 04:04:58,059
I don't want it

3060
04:04:58,059 --> 04:05:01,979
Painter is a god npc. You're really making a lot of people very sad right now

3061
04:05:10,350 --> 04:05:23,260
Summoner weapon proficiency level up. So what what are you doing?

3062
04:05:27,389 --> 04:05:29,389
Apparently it didn't have a table

3063
04:05:35,389 --> 04:05:45,649
These things are pretty good

3064
04:05:45,649 --> 04:05:48,049
So equipable, what do I equip it though?

3065
04:05:49,170 --> 04:05:50,540
Oh

3066
04:05:50,540 --> 04:05:52,700
Uh, it's in the corruption. It doesn't count as a house

3067
04:05:55,090 --> 04:05:59,170
Never mind is that is it just right there. What does he do just stare at me?

3068
04:06:01,340 --> 04:06:03,979
Oh, yeah, that's just the pet most pets don't do anything

3069
04:06:07,360 --> 04:06:11,040
I have the I have a bee following me. Oh, I was wondering what the bee was

3070
04:06:15,620 --> 04:06:19,860
There's some good pets that like provide light and stuff, but most of them do not

3071
04:06:20,899 --> 04:06:25,659
So we're just walking to the right until we find

3072
04:06:27,389 --> 04:06:28,030
the

3073
04:06:28,030 --> 04:06:29,469
meteor

3074
04:06:29,469 --> 04:06:30,350
Yeah

3075
04:06:30,350 --> 04:06:33,629
But there's no other goal. We just walk right until we see it

3076
04:06:34,510 --> 04:06:40,450
Yep, because on our map we explored left and I didn't see a meteorite on the map. The map always updates automatically

3077
04:06:41,329 --> 04:06:42,290
Oh

3078
04:06:42,290 --> 04:06:44,290
So it should be this way

3079
04:06:47,120 --> 04:06:50,319
Then there's gonna be some sick sick ass meteor heads

3080
04:06:53,639 --> 04:06:56,840
So when we get to the meteor, does the boss just spawn after we touch it or something?

3081
04:06:57,909 --> 04:07:00,309
No, the meteor is uh, you just it's

3082
04:07:01,110 --> 04:07:03,350
A resource just so you get meteorites from it

3083
04:07:04,149 --> 04:07:06,149
What is this?

3084
04:07:08,690 --> 04:07:13,489
Uh kill that kill it kill it kill it i am i am i'm killing it so we need the blighted gel from it

3085
04:07:20,579 --> 04:07:22,579
Oh god, oh god, dude

3086
04:07:23,459 --> 04:07:26,260
I dropped 22 gold in that hole. I'll get it

3087
04:07:29,959 --> 04:07:33,030
We still haven't made hooks

3088
04:07:33,030 --> 04:07:37,139
How far down is that hole?

3089
04:07:37,139 --> 04:07:38,979
So i'm gonna rope down there

3090
04:07:38,979 --> 04:07:47,750
It's not that far. Should I just jump?

3091
04:07:49,510 --> 04:07:51,510
You can see where you're dude

3092
04:07:51,909 --> 04:07:53,350
I believe in you

3093
04:07:53,350 --> 04:08:08,399
Do I have any rope?

3094
04:08:08,399 --> 04:08:11,360
Are you even in the right hole? No, you're not other hole. What do you mean other hole?

3095
04:08:12,159 --> 04:08:15,799
There's another hole right guy. I don't know if it shows for you. Oh, no

3096
04:08:16,440 --> 04:08:17,719
Okay

3097
04:08:22,959 --> 04:08:24,159
So are you

3098
04:08:24,159 --> 04:08:26,239
Stay trying to stay down here or what are you doing? What are you up to?

3099
04:08:26,399 --> 04:08:28,959
I'm coming back up. I'm just making sure I get the gel from that thing

3100
04:08:29,600 --> 04:08:42,959
That's over here

3101
04:08:42,959 --> 04:08:51,379
rotten chunk

3102
04:08:51,379 --> 04:08:53,700
I'm afraid to just walk forward now because of that

3103
04:09:00,680 --> 04:09:02,280
I've got the grab arm

3104
04:09:02,280 --> 04:09:04,639
I'm just gonna hold my torch out

3105
04:09:09,350 --> 04:09:11,750
That's bright. Oh, we still have to do this actually

3106
04:09:13,510 --> 04:09:16,389
I forgot about this guy

3107
04:09:16,389 --> 04:09:21,959
Huh? Hurry we need to build platforms

3108
04:09:24,440 --> 04:09:26,120
Hurry

3109
04:09:26,120 --> 04:09:28,120
We're gonna fight somebody

3110
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:32,079
And he's a pain in the ass

3111
04:09:32,790 --> 04:09:34,709
Fight pain in the ass guy

3112
04:09:34,709 --> 04:09:38,870
Yeah, you have to uh, you talk to the old man in front of this which is the dungeon

3113
04:09:39,829 --> 04:09:45,270
You can only enter the dungeon after you free him of his curse and his curse is that a giant forearm skeleton lives inside of

3114
04:09:45,270 --> 04:09:47,270
His body and you gotta fight it

3115
04:09:47,670 --> 04:09:49,670
It's a pretty wicked curse

3116
04:09:49,750 --> 04:09:51,750
That is a pretty big curse

3117
04:09:52,549 --> 04:10:01,319
Yeah

3118
04:10:01,319 --> 04:10:03,319
This is a big platform you're making

3119
04:10:08,440 --> 04:10:14,790
He's a piece of shit

3120
04:10:14,790 --> 04:10:16,790
In fact, I worry about us

3121
04:10:16,790 --> 04:10:18,450
Do you?

3122
04:10:18,450 --> 04:10:22,530
Yeah, I do. You ready? I guess eat your food free food

3123
04:10:23,809 --> 04:10:27,489
Okay

3124
04:10:27,489 --> 04:10:29,489
I've free fooded

3125
04:10:29,489 --> 04:10:36,530
Oh, he doesn't have four arms. Is that only the

3126
04:10:37,389 --> 04:10:41,239
Mechanical guy

3127
04:10:41,239 --> 04:10:43,239
I guess we all have a curse

3128
04:10:45,639 --> 04:10:49,280
Oh, he's a chump freaking normal mode

3129
04:10:53,319 --> 04:11:00,819
Oh bees

3130
04:11:00,819 --> 04:11:02,819
There's a certain place we should be aiming

3131
04:11:02,979 --> 04:11:08,959
into his head

3132
04:11:08,959 --> 04:11:09,920
chump

3133
04:11:09,920 --> 04:11:15,280
I thought you said he was really hard

3134
04:11:15,280 --> 04:11:17,360
He can be but I don't usually play on baby mode

3135
04:11:21,600 --> 04:11:24,479
Let's turn the drop. Sorry drop anything. Sorry. I'm the anchor

3136
04:11:26,280 --> 04:11:28,840
No, it's fine. Like really normal mode eventually when we get into the

3137
04:11:29,719 --> 04:11:32,469
Still hard. Okay

3138
04:11:32,469 --> 04:11:35,600
So now we can go in the dungeon

3139
04:11:36,389 --> 04:11:40,389
Uh, yeah, I want to keep looking for the meteor though. Oh right, right, right, right, right, right

3140
04:11:42,370 --> 04:11:45,250
Though the dungeon has a couple of things we could really use

3141
04:11:52,979 --> 04:11:55,139
We are very far away from our home

3142
04:11:56,850 --> 04:11:58,850
Here I got two

3143
04:12:00,870 --> 04:12:02,309
Manicristo

3144
04:12:02,309 --> 04:12:03,909
Yeah, I gave you two

3145
04:12:03,909 --> 04:12:06,440
zombie banner

3146
04:12:06,440 --> 04:12:11,159
Uh, it auto gives that to you when like 50 of something dies and if you hang out at home

3147
04:12:11,399 --> 04:12:14,120
You deal like two times damage for that enemy

3148
04:12:15,479 --> 04:12:21,200
Cool

3149
04:12:21,200 --> 04:12:24,100
It's a neat little game

3150
04:12:24,100 --> 04:12:26,100
So there's no meteor

3151
04:12:29,590 --> 04:12:31,590
And your follow-up to that?

3152
04:12:32,690 --> 04:12:33,969
No

3153
04:12:33,969 --> 04:12:37,559
Uh, I guess I was wrong. Let's go in the dungeon

3154
04:12:41,170 --> 04:12:43,170
Into the dungeon it is

3155
04:12:46,659 --> 04:12:55,360
Ow what these crocodile things geez who the fuck is who's tyler?

3156
04:12:56,399 --> 04:12:58,399
Oh, he's the fishing

3157
04:12:58,879 --> 04:13:00,159
No

3158
04:13:00,159 --> 04:13:02,159
Don't die don't die, dude

3159
04:13:03,510 --> 04:13:05,190
You're gonna die

3160
04:13:05,190 --> 04:13:07,430
You're gonna die. No, i'm trying to avoid being hit

3161
04:13:08,610 --> 04:13:10,610
No, that's oh, that's my stupid

3162
04:13:10,770 --> 04:13:13,010
I thought the owl was coming to get me

3163
04:13:13,409 --> 04:13:23,430
Thank you, dude. I was on a healing streak

3164
04:13:24,229 --> 04:13:27,620
These kids don't even know about me

3165
04:13:36,559 --> 04:13:38,559
I'm out of ammo

3166
04:13:41,139 --> 04:13:44,100
Uh, somebody said the meteor is probably on the sky that's pretty likely

3167
04:13:45,139 --> 04:13:47,139
God sky meteor, I guess

3168
04:13:48,100 --> 04:13:50,100
In this particular seed

3169
04:13:50,180 --> 04:13:52,180
I don't think i've ever seen that

3170
04:13:57,139 --> 04:14:00,399
Thank god i'm so stupid

3171
04:14:05,540 --> 04:14:07,940
Uh rope oh because I have

3172
04:14:09,860 --> 04:14:11,299
A lot of jump

3173
04:14:11,299 --> 04:14:14,049
You could probably turn into a frog and do it

3174
04:14:14,370 --> 04:14:16,049
Would that be better?

3175
04:14:16,049 --> 04:14:18,049
Oh is that do I jump higher?

3176
04:14:18,610 --> 04:14:21,649
The first jump you do is higher. Yeah. Well, I you didn't tell me that

3177
04:14:22,690 --> 04:14:24,870
I thought it was just a cosmetic thing

3178
04:14:28,950 --> 04:14:35,350
Nice automatically update. Isn't that a lie though? Because you can see plantera's bulbs when they become available

3179
04:14:35,829 --> 04:14:37,829
If you've already been in that spot

3180
04:14:38,309 --> 04:14:44,819
It's very dark up here

3181
04:14:46,840 --> 04:14:48,680
Where are you going?

3182
04:14:48,680 --> 04:14:51,379
I'm going to the dungeon

3183
04:14:51,379 --> 04:14:52,340
Oh

3184
04:14:52,340 --> 04:14:56,440
I was just hoping there would be something up there

3185
04:15:03,139 --> 04:15:04,659
Okay

3186
04:15:04,659 --> 04:15:06,899
Into the dungeons. This is this is the dungeon

3187
04:15:07,940 --> 04:15:11,299
This is the oh, yeah. Okay. So what you need to find and make sure you

3188
04:15:11,940 --> 04:15:13,940
see him is uh

3189
04:15:15,799 --> 04:15:20,920
Uh golden keys gold because there's gonna be a bunch of golden chests down here that you need keys to open

3190
04:15:21,239 --> 04:15:23,239
That drop from the enemies

3191
04:15:23,319 --> 04:15:28,520
Okay, so look for golden keys and inside a golden chest the number one thing

3192
04:15:29,399 --> 04:15:31,399
We're looking out for yeah

3193
04:15:32,200 --> 04:15:34,200
Is a uh shadow key

3194
04:15:35,159 --> 04:15:39,479
Shadow key so we need we need a key to get a new key is what that's that's the goal

3195
04:15:40,120 --> 04:15:44,120
That's like best case. Otherwise, there's just like decent stuff in these chests understood

3196
04:15:48,479 --> 04:15:50,879
So how far down does this go?

3197
04:15:50,879 --> 04:15:52,479
Uh, it's pretty big

3198
04:15:52,479 --> 04:16:02,469
It's uh pretty

3199
04:16:03,409 --> 04:16:05,409
Pretty pretty big

3200
04:16:07,270 --> 04:16:12,090
Oh, and we got the uh, the the mechanic who is my terraria waifu

3201
04:16:13,540 --> 04:16:16,549
Just in case you're wondering

3202
04:16:16,549 --> 04:16:18,549
We got wire cutter

3203
04:16:20,690 --> 04:16:26,129
She's the person that lets you set up like the wires to set up teleporters and stuff. Oh, what's this do?

3204
04:16:28,840 --> 04:16:31,159
There's like a switch here. I can't press it

3205
04:16:35,989 --> 04:16:37,989
Waiting for you

3206
04:16:38,229 --> 04:16:40,229
What's the switch do?

3207
04:16:41,010 --> 04:16:43,969
Uh turns on the lights. Oh, so why didn't I turn it?

3208
04:16:47,479 --> 04:16:50,760
It turns on like one small lantern you probably just didn't notice

3209
04:16:56,260 --> 04:16:57,139
chest

3210
04:16:57,139 --> 04:17:02,790
This is the key needs to have one of those golden keys. Yep

3211
04:17:08,159 --> 04:17:10,959
the ultra stream sting i'm a streamer

3212
04:17:17,379 --> 04:17:19,459
There are spikes on the walls and floors that hurt

3213
04:17:20,819 --> 04:17:25,219
That are they are hurt. There's also traps down here. So like dark traps that'll shoot things out

3214
04:17:25,780 --> 04:17:27,780
You step on the pressure plates great

3215
04:17:30,040 --> 04:17:32,040
Really looking forward to that

3216
04:17:32,760 --> 04:17:34,760
And those things that go along the ground

3217
04:17:37,030 --> 04:17:41,809
The heck is that you just like summon a bunch of spots

3218
04:17:45,600 --> 04:17:47,600
So there's the key that we don't have

3219
04:17:48,479 --> 04:17:50,639
What what just hit me?

3220
04:17:50,639 --> 04:17:52,239
uh dart trap

3221
04:17:52,239 --> 04:17:59,479
They're hard to see

3222
04:17:59,479 --> 04:18:01,600
rained on

3223
04:18:01,600 --> 04:18:04,399
Do aggro them up here and they'll get hit by my rain clouds

3224
04:18:05,670 --> 04:18:14,309
all comboed

3225
04:18:14,389 --> 04:18:18,629
And the thing he's standing on are spikes. You don't stand on spikes spikes are bad wand core

3226
04:18:21,780 --> 04:18:25,059
Uh, they craft some really shitty wands that are really complicated to make

3227
04:18:27,059 --> 04:18:29,059
There's like one decent one

3228
04:18:30,610 --> 04:18:32,610
If I remember correctly

3229
04:18:46,049 --> 04:18:52,200
Um, what do I do? Uh, you see i'm attached to the ceiling with a I thought

3230
04:18:52,760 --> 04:18:55,479
The fucking painting was like a platform

3231
04:18:56,360 --> 04:18:58,360
This game is so dark

3232
04:19:01,239 --> 04:19:08,229
Oh

3233
04:19:08,229 --> 04:19:19,120
All right. We're uh, how did you make that hook that you're attached to the ceiling with?

3234
04:19:20,149 --> 04:19:21,760
um

3235
04:19:21,760 --> 04:19:24,000
You can check the box

3236
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:28,959
You need 15 of a gem so if we have like 15 amethyst or something

3237
04:19:30,079 --> 04:19:32,159
I don't think we have

3238
04:19:32,159 --> 04:19:36,450
enough

3239
04:19:36,450 --> 04:19:43,639
No, well, we're coming back. Uh, I think I didn't have that much money. I don't think but there was some gold down there

3240
04:19:43,639 --> 04:19:45,159
I would go get it

3241
04:19:45,159 --> 04:19:51,600
Put the stuff away

3242
04:19:51,600 --> 04:19:53,680
Our we're we're full

3243
04:19:55,399 --> 04:19:57,399
We're full our box is full

3244
04:20:00,040 --> 04:20:02,040
We can take some shit out

3245
04:20:10,209 --> 04:20:21,489
Cane dust

3246
04:20:21,489 --> 04:20:24,440
Making night owl potion

3247
04:20:24,440 --> 04:20:27,010
Really? Is that gonna help me?

3248
04:20:27,010 --> 04:20:29,010
Not really. Oh, yeah, maybe

3249
04:20:29,250 --> 04:20:31,969
We need there's a potion vendor too and he would sell them for cheap

3250
04:20:32,930 --> 04:20:36,799
Then where was it?

3251
04:20:36,799 --> 04:20:38,799
He is not enjoying this yet

3252
04:20:39,409 --> 04:20:42,530
Can I craft that or did I have here it is increases night vision?

3253
04:20:44,100 --> 04:20:47,540
Uh, give me that please because also I think it's called a shine potion

3254
04:20:50,370 --> 04:20:53,170
What the fuck is going on right now in the house

3255
04:20:55,520 --> 04:20:57,600
What if I die in the house i'm gonna

3256
04:20:58,719 --> 04:21:00,719
What is going he's still alive?

3257
04:21:07,540 --> 04:21:08,899
Hi, yay

04:21:08,899 --> 04:21:12,549
Who left the door? You left the doors open

3259
04:21:12,629 --> 04:21:16,899
You let in a draft

3260
04:21:16,899 --> 04:21:20,020
Wait, you've been at home for how long now and you're gonna start blaming me all of a sudden

3261
04:21:21,079 --> 04:21:22,600
All right. So, um

3262
04:21:22,600 --> 04:21:25,559
Do we have any more of those wormhole potions or am I uh screwed here?

3263
04:21:26,520 --> 04:21:28,520
Uh, I have four on me

3264
04:21:28,920 --> 04:21:30,760
Does that help you?

3265
04:21:30,760 --> 04:21:33,280
Can I buy them or can I make them? What do they take to make?

3266
04:21:34,079 --> 04:21:36,079
I don't think you can

3267
04:21:36,479 --> 04:21:40,319
Well, I mean you can I just have no idea how who is somebody does somebody sell them

3268
04:21:41,200 --> 04:21:44,979
Does anybody know?

I need blink root

3270
04:21:46,739 --> 04:21:48,899
So it looks like I have to just come come follow down here

3271
04:21:54,870 --> 04:21:56,870
Why are you doing something else?

3272
04:21:56,870 --> 04:21:58,709
What do you want me to do?

3273
04:21:58,709 --> 04:21:59,750

Doesn't hey germa. Do you see this thing over here? That's not as cool. It's not as cool if I didn't earn it

3287
04:22:58,040 --> 04:22:59,319
germa

3288
04:22:59,319 --> 04:23:01,940
a floating book

3289
04:23:01,940 --> 04:23:03,620
Yeah, I guess it's

3290
04:23:03,620 --> 04:23:05,600
I guess it's cool

3291
04:23:05,600 --> 04:23:07,680
When you come over here and you right click the floating book

3292
04:23:08,559 --> 04:23:11,440
Yeah, you're gonna have an additional summon for 10 minutes

3293
04:23:12,399 --> 04:23:14,840
Um, I guess that's cool

3294
04:23:15,239 --> 04:23:17,719
It's really cool dad. Like thanks

3295
04:23:18,680 --> 04:23:20,680
It's just too bad. You didn't earn it

3296
04:23:22,920 --> 04:23:26,370
This game is dark

3297
04:23:26,450 --> 04:23:27,879
Okay

3298
04:23:27,879 --> 04:23:31,520
So you said you're gonna

3299
04:23:31,520 --> 04:23:35,200
Uh, this thing is what what's going on with this thing guys?

3300
04:23:36,639 --> 04:23:38,000
Hold on

3301
04:23:38,000 --> 04:23:43,440
I gotta try

3302
04:23:43,440 --> 04:23:45,040
Where are you? Oh

3303
04:23:45,040 --> 04:23:48,479
I thought you jumped in a hole

3304
04:23:48,559 --> 04:23:49,760
Ooh

3305
04:23:49,760 --> 04:23:52,899
Ooh sparklers 29

3306
04:23:53,299 --> 04:23:54,739
magic damage

3307
04:23:54,739 --> 04:23:57,989
That's pretty good

3308
04:23:57,989 --> 04:24:00,559
So this next one is high tide

3309
04:24:01,680 --> 04:24:04,959
Sends out a droplet of water that will create small tidal waves

3310
04:24:06,479 --> 04:24:08,479
Ooh, that's cool

3311
04:24:08,719 --> 04:24:11,090
Takes a lot of uh, mana

3312
04:24:12,930 --> 04:24:16,930
Oh, there's too many items for me to I don't know what I want to do with any of these. Um

3313
04:24:18,850 --> 04:24:22,690
Uh

3314
04:24:23,649 --> 04:24:27,270
It's a lot i'm gonna this is a lot of damage and it's close range

3315
04:24:31,479 --> 04:24:38,770
I don't know. I think i'm gonna get rid of dark wave

3316
04:24:43,729 --> 04:24:45,729
That's not close range

3317
04:24:49,090 --> 04:24:52,530
Oh, all right. Yeah. All right. This is awesome. I thought it was

3318
04:24:53,090 --> 04:24:55,010
Okay

3319
04:24:55,010 --> 04:24:57,520

Dark wave is out

3323
04:25:08,309 --> 04:25:09,590
and I think

3324
04:25:09,590 --> 04:25:13,559
High tide isn't doing it for me

3325
04:25:13,559 --> 04:25:15,399
I like um, I like

3327
04:25:17,559 --> 04:25:19,989
I appreciate you giving this to me

3328
04:25:20,450 --> 04:25:22,719
But i'm not for me

3329
04:25:22,719 --> 04:25:24,000
Yeah

3330
04:25:24,000 --> 04:25:29,989
You gotta get eyes on

3331
04:25:29,989 --> 04:25:31,909
So i'm gonna store it

3332
04:25:31,909 --> 04:25:33,909
Have you done any uh consolidation here?

3333
04:25:34,709 --> 04:25:36,709

04:25:56,229 --> 04:25:58,229
Weapons are used to make better weapons later

3337
04:26:00,319 --> 04:26:01,920
Just a

3338
04:26:01,920 --> 04:26:03,600
never-ending trade

3339
04:26:03,600 --> 04:26:11,319
Take that back

3340
04:26:11,319 --> 04:26:21,940
Okay, um

3341
04:26:21,940 --> 04:26:24,629
potions

3342
04:26:24,629 --> 04:26:25,909
um

3343
04:26:25,909 --> 04:26:27,909
Give me this I want to use that

3344
04:26:29,040 --> 04:26:31,040
I cannot believe we haven't had a blood moon yet

3345
04:26:31,840 --> 04:26:35,170
What happens I cannot believe it

3346
04:26:35,329 --> 04:26:40,790
What's a blood moon?

3347
04:26:40,790 --> 04:26:42,790
Uh, it's just at night

3348
04:26:43,030 --> 04:26:46,149
A blood moon status and a whole bunch of enemies attack you and they drop some things

3349
04:26:46,549 --> 04:26:50,069
And then after the first blood moon, there's an npc that'll join you

3350
04:26:51,430 --> 04:26:56,530
How do I just take them?

3351
04:26:56,770 --> 04:26:58,770
Stop stop stop stop stop stop stop

3352
04:27:01,940 --> 04:27:03,940
I just want one of these. Okay. I got it

3353
04:27:06,520 --> 04:27:08,819
All right

3354
04:27:08,819 --> 04:27:10,819
I'm ready to attempt that again

3355
04:27:10,979 --> 04:27:16,120
I got food. I have uh tortures. I need some rope though

3356
04:27:16,920 --> 04:27:23,159
You can start walking there and I'll teleport you rope rope rope rope. What's the quickest way to make a rope with the spider webs?

3357
04:27:24,600 --> 04:27:26,600
Uh cobweb. Yeah

3358
04:27:27,170 --> 04:27:29,170
I can make you some if you don't have it

3359
04:27:30,850 --> 04:27:33,329
I don't have I don't have very much. No

3360
04:27:34,209 --> 04:27:36,069
There you go

3361
04:27:36,069 --> 04:27:38,209
That's a lot

3362
04:27:38,209 --> 04:27:42,709
Okay, i'm gonna touch this thing. They're not run out. Okay, i'm going

3363
04:27:44,629 --> 04:27:45,670
See

3364
04:27:45,670 --> 04:27:47,780
See you later

3365
04:27:47,780 --> 04:28:01,190
See you there

3366
04:28:01,190 --> 04:28:03,670
Is there can we put like a checkpoint flag somewhere over here?

3367
04:28:07,510 --> 04:28:11,590
What is there? We can't put like a checkpoint flag. We have to always have to go all the way over here again

3368
04:28:12,469 --> 04:28:14,790
Mm-hmm unless you want to build a wine cart

3369
04:28:15,670 --> 04:28:17,670
That goes all the way there

3370
04:28:17,670 --> 04:28:22,129
You just make a bed there

3371
04:28:22,129 --> 04:28:24,129
Yeah, but then you won't have this bed

3372
04:28:24,450 --> 04:28:28,290
That's true

3373
04:28:28,290 --> 04:28:30,290
You make a sleeping bag

3374
04:28:30,290 --> 04:28:33,090
Or a tent

3375
04:28:33,090 --> 04:28:35,090
Sounds interesting

3376
04:28:38,229 --> 04:28:40,229
I don't even know what the hell that was but

3377
04:28:42,479 --> 04:28:48,360
Got hurt from it

3378
04:28:48,360 --> 04:28:51,239
I gotta build houses man. Like I don't wanna

3379
04:28:52,360 --> 04:28:55,920
But I gotta

3380
04:28:55,920 --> 04:28:57,920
Are zombies in raincoats?

3381
04:28:58,799 --> 04:29:00,370
Yeah

3382
04:29:00,370 --> 04:29:02,370
That's that's very cute

3383
04:29:05,010 --> 04:29:08,290
I'm just gonna that's just like what else do you want me to say?

3384
04:29:09,520 --> 04:29:11,520
Oh, that's your spot on

3385
04:29:12,000 --> 04:29:15,139
I mean, it's raining

3386
04:29:15,139 --> 04:29:29,079
This fishing in this game. Yeah, didn't you say that you didn't you didn't really dabble into fishing at all?

3387
04:29:29,639 --> 04:29:31,639
I have never dabbled

3388
04:29:31,959 --> 04:29:33,409
you have

3389
04:29:33,409 --> 04:29:36,049
How many what do you have like six seven eight hundred hours in this game?

3390
04:29:37,489 --> 04:29:43,440
Uh about 200

3391
04:29:43,760 --> 04:29:46,000
Really even after all the other times you played this

3392
04:29:48,319 --> 04:29:50,319
I mean I had I okay I had

3393
04:29:50,459 --> 04:29:52,899
Uh 160

3394
04:29:55,649 --> 04:30:00,290
And I didn't play it that much when it was new. I played like 60 hours and there wasn't that much to do

3395
04:30:01,829 --> 04:30:03,200
um

3396
04:30:03,200 --> 04:30:07,680
Way back when the game first came out that skeleton that we just beat was like the final boss

3397
04:30:08,159 --> 04:30:11,840
Are you serious? I think when terraria was first released there was nothing after that. Wow

3398
04:30:13,920 --> 04:30:15,920
That's so that's so

3399
04:30:17,360 --> 04:30:18,879
Early

3400
04:30:18,879 --> 04:30:20,879
Yeah, and now he's like

3401
04:30:22,479 --> 04:30:24,479
Yeah, there's there's a lot of shit

3402
04:30:28,420 --> 04:30:30,420
Only the game's been out for so long

3403
04:30:30,500 --> 04:30:32,260
Oh cool

3404
04:30:32,260 --> 04:30:41,219
I'm freaking out. I didn't have enough

3405
04:30:41,620 --> 04:30:49,239
Do I have three? No, one more big snowball head

3406
04:30:56,209 --> 04:31:00,930
I don't think i'm gonna be changing weapons for a very long time. This thing is unbelievable

3407
04:31:02,659 --> 04:31:04,340
Does a bunch of damage

3408
04:31:04,340 --> 04:31:06,899
It's got a nice spread on it

3409
04:31:06,899 --> 04:31:08,899
Nice spread doesn't use that much mana

3410
04:31:11,959 --> 04:31:13,959
For the first time in my life

3411
04:31:14,040 --> 04:31:17,079
I feel like i'm truly true. No, I can't do that

3412
04:31:24,770 --> 04:31:27,399
Yeah, and it lights my way

3413
04:31:27,399 --> 04:31:29,719
I don't even need torches anymore. I can just go like this

3414
04:31:33,889 --> 04:31:35,489
I need torches

3415
04:31:35,489 --> 04:31:37,489
Uh, I have 76

3416
04:31:38,979 --> 04:31:42,420
You should definitely make some though. So I because i'm a very unreliable person

3417
04:31:43,459 --> 04:31:45,459
Don't like rely on me for that

3418
04:31:48,479 --> 04:31:52,000
Because you know what's gonna happen torches you're gonna be very disappointed. I

3419
04:31:55,010 --> 04:32:05,059
I need torches

3420
04:32:05,459 --> 04:32:07,459
Am I there where is this place

3421
04:32:12,340 --> 04:32:14,520
Where the hell is this place?

3422
04:32:14,520 --> 04:32:18,440
I'm not even there yet. Yeah, you're not there yet

3423
04:32:20,709 --> 04:32:22,469
I thought you were the guy

3424
04:32:22,469 --> 04:32:24,469
No, i'm not. I have a mini map open

3425
04:32:34,639 --> 04:32:37,280
Okay, I have 1800 torches i'm ready to go

3426
04:32:38,719 --> 04:32:40,959
All right. Well, i'm like almost there

3427
04:32:40,959 --> 04:32:43,040
I'm at where we bought the skeleton guy

3428
04:32:44,000 --> 04:32:49,459
What flavor jawbreaker do you want when I go to the jawbreaker store?

3429
04:32:51,620 --> 04:32:53,860
um

3430
04:32:53,860 --> 04:32:56,739
Uh plain chocolate. No, just plain

3431
04:33:04,020 --> 04:33:07,540
All right. I've made it you can teleport to me whenever you want whenever you feel like it

3432
04:33:15,330 --> 04:33:23,430
Concrete plain the one that is just the white one that has all the other ones inside of it

3433
04:33:24,229 --> 04:33:26,849
Did you know that fish isn't good for you?

3434
04:33:27,250 --> 04:33:30,049
Um

3435
04:33:32,900 --> 04:33:36,819
I don't I don't sure what I I can't even give that a response. It's actually true

3436
04:33:37,860 --> 04:33:39,619
the new reports

3437
04:33:39,619 --> 04:33:44,080
Yeah, I think it's like doctor sign sign wiser

3438
04:33:44,799 --> 04:33:48,240
I'm saying that like you're a dummy a fisher from the ocean and you're not

3439
04:33:48,799 --> 04:33:50,959
Stop eating them

3440
04:33:50,959 --> 04:33:52,319
All right. Well

3441
04:33:52,319 --> 04:33:56,209
I forgot to buy musket balls your mercury

3442
04:33:57,009 --> 04:33:59,169
Not every fish is full of mercury

3443
04:34:00,130 --> 04:34:07,490
And all that mercury and like cod

3444
04:34:09,619 --> 04:34:11,380
That's no joke

3445
04:34:11,380 --> 04:34:13,380
All that it's not

3446
04:34:15,599 --> 04:34:17,119
Yeah, and guess what?

3447
04:34:17,119 --> 04:34:18,720
when you cook

3448
04:34:18,720 --> 04:34:20,319
meat on a grill

3449
04:34:20,319 --> 04:34:23,220
It releases a shitload of carcinogenics

3450
04:34:24,740 --> 04:34:29,380
All that stuff that you like to eat. I like those crispy edges and the little charcoal crispy

3451
04:34:29,380 --> 04:34:32,819
It that's it's awful awful for you, but we do it. Oh, everybody does it

3452
04:34:33,619 --> 04:34:35,459
I don't do it

3453
04:34:35,459 --> 04:34:40,259
You've never had a grilled piece of meat. What am I fucking bumping my head on i'm getting too angry at this game

3454
04:34:40,340 --> 04:34:50,770
I gotta slow down

3455
04:34:50,930 --> 04:34:53,569
Who's who actually has grilled pieces of meat?

3456
04:34:55,220 --> 04:34:59,250
What like your grandfather maybe?

3457
04:35:00,290 --> 04:35:07,119
What is it coming over here? What is that thing? What's this plan destroy that as a trap? Oh, all right, this is kind of

3458
04:35:07,919 --> 04:35:10,479
So is there a boss at the bottom of this?

3459
04:35:10,720 --> 04:35:15,509
No

3460
04:35:15,509 --> 04:35:18,790
Uh later there is a boss here much much much much later

3461
04:35:19,750 --> 04:35:22,180
For now, it's just kind of a pet

3462
04:35:22,740 --> 04:35:24,740
And bones

3463
04:35:28,259 --> 04:35:40,740
All the money down there, but too, uh scared to go over there. Oh my god, what are you doing dying?

3464
04:35:42,799 --> 04:35:43,840
you

3465
04:35:43,840 --> 04:35:45,119
Okay

3466
04:35:45,119 --> 04:35:48,159
Yeah, we're fine. All food is bad. Just eat air

3467
04:35:49,919 --> 04:35:51,919
Actually water is bad for you

3468
04:35:58,680 --> 04:36:01,650
It's true

3469
04:36:01,650 --> 04:36:07,139
dungeon heist

3470
04:36:07,139 --> 04:36:11,540
Blue candles spawning more enemies kill the blue candles. Don't kill the blue candles

3471
04:36:12,419 --> 04:36:15,040
But somebody on the internet told me to do that

3472
04:36:15,759 --> 04:36:20,080
But that somebody doesn't know that we really would like more of me so that they have a higher chance of

3473
04:36:21,119 --> 04:36:24,450
That's where I died before

3474
04:36:24,450 --> 04:36:26,450
I'm gonna make the same mistake twice

3475
04:36:32,819 --> 04:36:34,819
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

3476
04:36:35,299 --> 04:36:43,169
All right, so is it not safe to go down there?

3477
04:36:43,650 --> 04:36:46,369
Did you get my stuff down there by the way on the bottom here? I did I did

3478
04:36:46,450 --> 04:36:48,450
I'm just making sure I'm just making I know I just I know

3479
04:36:49,409 --> 04:36:52,610
No, you don't make sure you think you know, you always talk about how you know

3480
04:36:53,569 --> 04:37:01,880
My wife gets me dinner

3481
04:37:04,360 --> 04:37:08,279
Slot machine, what did you say? This is I that thing you just pulled it looks like a slot machine

3482
04:37:08,439 --> 04:37:10,360
I didn't know what it was

3483
04:37:10,360 --> 04:37:13,619
You're not calling my wife a slot machine

3484
04:37:14,259 --> 04:37:20,580
No, that is not what I said slot machine as in like a question. Is that a slot machine next to you?

3485
04:37:23,680 --> 04:37:25,680
I don't I didn't see it

3486
04:37:29,040 --> 04:37:35,919
You pulled a lever and it made the whole room dark you get any keys I don't think so

3487
04:37:39,250 --> 04:37:40,450
I have two

3488
04:37:40,450 --> 04:37:41,729
I have one

3489
04:37:41,729 --> 04:37:45,750
I have one key

3490
04:37:46,069 --> 04:37:49,189
Are you do you want to bring these pianos back? You want to make a dungeon room?

3491
04:37:51,729 --> 04:37:53,459
No

3492
04:37:53,459 --> 04:37:58,180
You don't just want to chill out and make like candy rooms and dungeon rooms. No, the candy room would be fun, but

3493
04:37:59,939 --> 04:38:01,779
Everything else is

3494
04:38:01,779 --> 04:38:03,779
Well, that was horrible that hurt

3495
04:38:09,090 --> 04:38:11,090
Hey, holy shit, man

3496
04:38:13,830 --> 04:38:29,060
Sitting up here. Um, how are we doing down there? All right, i'm gonna open this one

3497
04:38:29,700 --> 04:38:32,069
I already opened it. He did

3498
04:38:36,500 --> 04:38:38,500
Mystic magic missile

3499
04:38:39,459 --> 04:38:41,459
Mystic magic missile

3500
04:38:42,180 --> 04:38:47,380
Would you just drop it?

3501
04:38:47,380 --> 04:38:50,180
Yep

3502
04:38:50,180 --> 04:38:53,139
Wait, you're gonna get to use some magic myth

3503
04:38:54,259 --> 04:38:57,619
Did I pick it up?

3504
04:38:57,619 --> 04:39:02,159
Yeah

3505
04:39:02,159 --> 04:39:07,090
Well, i'll look at it later. Look at it now

3506
04:39:07,650 --> 04:39:13,169
Look at it now. I can't we're being fired at from all directions. I'm not just gonna stop and let me look at my items

3507
04:39:13,729 --> 04:39:15,729
It's a new item

3508
04:39:15,889 --> 04:39:19,110
What does it do?

3509
04:39:19,110 --> 04:39:24,069
That's okay. That's a lot of guys. Can we get some uh, I don't have this mystic magic missile

3510
04:39:25,490 --> 04:39:30,610
There's a rod. Oh 31 damage. All right, i'll give it a try. You're gonna see give it a try

3511
04:39:36,259 --> 04:39:46,849
Do you want to know why a magic missile is so good? What does it do? No

3512
04:39:48,759 --> 04:39:50,389
I guess it's

3513
04:39:50,389 --> 04:39:52,549
magic missile

3514
04:39:52,549 --> 04:39:54,790
Very fast very strong nine mana

3515
04:39:55,729 --> 04:40:00,209
It's just like a fast good item just goes like bang bang bang bang bang

3516
04:40:01,250 --> 04:40:04,450
It's like a little solo target. I like it. I don't love it though

3517
04:40:05,250 --> 04:40:08,069
Yeah, I think if you hold you can

3518
04:40:11,729 --> 04:40:15,810
But also your other thing does feel a lot better yeah, the other one's more mana efficient

3519
04:40:16,930 --> 04:40:22,240
Is that what you guys think a meteorite?

3520
04:40:27,750 --> 04:40:32,689
Hold the button

3521
04:40:32,689 --> 04:40:34,369
Oh you can

3522
04:40:34,369 --> 04:40:36,840
Hold on. Can I just like

3523
04:40:36,840 --> 04:40:39,159
Have that sit on somebody?

3524
04:40:40,790 --> 04:40:42,790
Can I sit that on somebody?

3525
04:40:43,029 --> 04:40:46,819
and it

3526
04:40:46,819 --> 04:40:49,540
No, okay. I didn't know if I could just hold it continuously on them

3527
04:40:57,200 --> 04:41:00,819
You got any keys now we need to stay I do we need to stick together

3528
04:41:04,069 --> 04:41:07,830
I'm looking for chests. You're just fighting the same old thing looking at your dumb item

3529
04:41:08,549 --> 04:41:12,709
How come I don't get items? You should check on how that item works. Jeremy

3530
04:41:13,430 --> 04:41:17,349
So you said and I said, okay i'll give it a try I was joking

3531
04:41:26,369 --> 04:41:31,409
How much further are we gonna go deep dungeon, isn't it?

3532
04:41:32,290 --> 04:41:38,689
Is there a golden chest thing?

3533
04:41:40,150 --> 04:41:41,590
right here

3534
04:41:41,590 --> 04:41:43,750
This isn't a locked one though

3535
04:41:43,750 --> 04:41:44,709
unlocked

3536
04:41:44,709 --> 04:41:47,459
It had a gold cannon

3537
04:41:47,459 --> 04:41:50,159
cool

3538
04:41:50,159 --> 04:41:52,080
The skulls they explode. They look like they explode

3539
04:41:52,880 --> 04:41:54,000
Nope

3540
04:41:54,000 --> 04:41:57,880
I'll kill this guy

3541
04:41:57,880 --> 04:42:02,279
Can I have that sword you don't use?

3542
04:42:02,279 --> 04:42:04,450
Uh, it's in the box

3543
04:42:04,450 --> 04:42:06,049
Uh you fucker

3544
04:42:06,049 --> 04:42:08,209
Why would I just carry that around with me if i'm not gonna use it?

3545
04:42:09,009 --> 04:42:12,450
I thought you were using it. I mean I I have too many items

3546
04:42:14,000 --> 04:42:16,959
I have too many cool things to use. I can't carry it around

3547
04:42:18,930 --> 04:42:21,330
You're the melee guy. You're the one that should have had it

3548
04:42:22,130 --> 04:42:25,169
Why did I why am I holding? I didn't want to be a melee guy

3549
04:42:26,209 --> 04:42:28,209
Well, what are you?

3550
04:42:29,009 --> 04:42:31,009
Oh, you didn't want to be melee guy

3551
04:42:35,729 --> 04:42:38,450
I want to play my tuba. How do I get what's going on?

3552
04:42:39,169 --> 04:42:42,689
Why am I stuck in this chest?

3553
04:42:42,689 --> 04:42:46,790
Uh

3554
04:42:46,790 --> 04:42:49,880
Oh happened to me too

3555
04:42:49,880 --> 04:42:51,119
What?

3556
04:42:51,119 --> 04:42:53,119
Yeah, that's uh, that's a bad program

3557
04:42:55,000 --> 04:42:55,959
Do I

3558
04:42:55,959 --> 04:42:58,659
Can I like put something in it?

3559
04:42:58,659 --> 04:43:01,619
I can't teleport. Yeah, it's just broken

3560
04:43:02,340 --> 04:43:03,700
I think we're fucked

3561
04:43:03,700 --> 04:43:06,819
No game over. Did you open it? Why'd you open it too?

3562
04:43:07,540 --> 04:43:09,540
Because I wanted to see what you

3563
04:43:10,659 --> 04:43:12,180
Open it

3564
04:43:12,180 --> 04:43:16,340
I just wanted to see if there was really a problem. I said i'm stuck. What's wrong?

3565
04:43:16,419 --> 04:43:18,689
And then uh

3566
04:43:18,689 --> 04:43:20,930
Are we sure there's nothing that can happen here?

3567
04:43:23,009 --> 04:43:25,009
Uh, you can leave and rejoin

3568
04:43:25,569 --> 04:43:27,569
Well, what would that was it gonna put me?

3569
04:43:28,130 --> 04:43:30,130
Uh back at your bed

3570
04:43:30,209 --> 04:43:32,529
What?

3571
04:43:32,529 --> 04:43:33,490
Yeah

3572
04:43:33,490 --> 04:43:37,970
Wait, okay. What if you stay here then the server will go down. Okay. What if you stay I come back and then teleport to you

3573
04:43:39,060 --> 04:43:41,060
Do you have a wormhole potion?

3574
04:43:41,889 --> 04:43:49,830
Uh, I I have them but I can't give them to you because we're both lost

3575
04:43:51,330 --> 04:43:54,369
I'm gonna have to leave too. No, can I I think I can I make

3576
04:43:55,330 --> 04:43:58,450
I think there might be a wormhole potion in the chest. All right. Hold on

3577
04:43:59,250 --> 04:44:04,529
I'll be back. I mean i'm i'm going to have to leave as well because i'm just talking but you own the place

3578
04:44:05,330 --> 04:44:07,330
I own the place

3579
04:44:08,439 --> 04:44:09,560
Fuck

3580
04:44:09,560 --> 04:44:11,000
No

3581
04:44:11,000 --> 04:44:13,720
I got it. Yeah, I saved an exit and got a bigger. Uh

3582
04:44:15,430 --> 04:44:21,110
Oh well, we have been live. Oh, i've been live for seven hours almost eight actually

3583
04:44:21,990 --> 04:44:23,909
So are we gonna keep going?

3584
04:44:23,909 --> 04:44:24,869
um

3585
04:44:24,869 --> 04:44:28,400
you uh do

3586
04:44:29,490 --> 04:44:31,650
You want to just let's get to the bottom of that dungeon

3587
04:44:34,580 --> 04:44:36,580
Okay, will that be like significant?

3588
04:44:37,479 --> 04:44:39,569
More time

3589
04:44:39,569 --> 04:44:42,709
No, not really. All right. Let's do that. It's don't open any chests

3590
04:44:45,520 --> 04:44:48,159
Any chest that isn't a golden chest you can't open anyway, so don't

3591
04:44:48,799 --> 04:44:50,520
Don't touch them

3592
04:44:50,520 --> 04:45:01,060
Okay. All right. So are you going back in?

3593
04:45:03,650 --> 04:45:11,909
Yeah, one second

3594
04:45:13,119 --> 04:45:19,090
You let me know you let me know when you're in there

3595
04:45:20,880 --> 04:45:22,080
I'm in there

3596
04:45:22,080 --> 04:45:23,040
Okay

3597
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:30,020
I want to join off of you use that character

3598
04:45:38,069 --> 04:45:40,310
Joining in game. Here we go

3599
04:45:41,270 --> 04:45:44,950
Yeah, there are some people here that like do not deserve to live in this house

3600
04:45:47,110 --> 04:45:49,110
Who are all these people?

3601
04:45:49,590 --> 04:45:52,319
Wait, hold on

3602
04:45:52,319 --> 04:45:54,319
Who the fuck are all these people?

3603
04:45:54,560 --> 04:45:57,889
Why did this become a hotel?

3604
04:45:58,900 --> 04:46:01,299
I like this is not even all of them

3605
04:46:08,040 --> 04:46:10,040
Hey paul

3606
04:46:10,040 --> 04:46:14,360
Is why you talk shit about the painter like like if you really need some painting done

3607
04:46:14,919 --> 04:46:18,200
You can go seek him out. All right. So listen what so what happens?

3608
04:46:19,080 --> 04:46:24,369
So these are just npcs that they just wander around if you don't lock them in a cage in your house

3609
04:46:25,169 --> 04:46:28,770
Where do they go? Just they all just scatter around where their home is

3610
04:46:30,130 --> 04:46:34,049
So the strategy is to keep them into little cubicles like it's an office

3611
04:46:35,169 --> 04:46:36,209
Yeah

3612
04:46:36,209 --> 04:46:40,130
And there's different departments. Otherwise they wander around and if you want to talk to one

3613
04:46:40,290 --> 04:46:44,369
They could be like next to someone and you'll like can't talk to them because they're under the other guy

3614
04:46:45,810 --> 04:46:57,250
But okay, okay, let's just say for instance if I threw a bomb in this room right now, uh, please

3615
04:46:59,169 --> 04:47:01,169
I'm just theoretically

3616
04:47:01,799 --> 04:47:04,310
Is it is that bad?

3617
04:47:04,310 --> 04:47:05,270
Yes, okay

3618
04:47:05,270 --> 04:47:11,750
I didn't know if they can be hurt or friendly fire. They can be hurt and more importantly you destroy the room and I you know

3619
04:47:11,750 --> 04:47:13,110
Who's a rebel?

3620
04:47:13,110 --> 04:47:17,830
Yes, i'm aware who's going to rebuild it. All right, let's let's go. Are you already on your way there?

3621
04:47:18,310 --> 04:47:20,630
Hold on. I'm like in the sky and I found three

3622
04:47:21,509 --> 04:47:22,950
planets

3623
04:47:22,950 --> 04:47:25,569
three planets

3624
04:47:25,569 --> 04:47:27,090
I'm just gonna like

3625
04:47:27,090 --> 04:47:29,090
Make people live up here really fast

3626
04:47:35,090 --> 04:47:37,729
I didn't bring like a workbench or wood

3627
04:47:38,689 --> 04:47:40,689
Mining potion flip. Yeah, we don't have any um

3628
04:47:41,569 --> 04:47:43,569
Any wormhole potions anyways?

3629
04:47:43,569 --> 04:47:50,389
I gotta join your team

3630
04:47:50,389 --> 04:47:52,229
Uh, do you want that?

3631
04:47:52,229 --> 04:47:54,229
What sword the cool one?

3632
04:47:54,630 --> 04:47:55,990
Yeah

3633
04:47:55,990 --> 04:47:57,509
All right. I have that

3634
04:47:57,509 --> 04:47:59,880
Is there anything else that I should take out of here?

3635
04:48:00,520 --> 04:48:02,520
That we I mean actually want to have with us

3636
04:48:04,419 --> 04:48:06,840
No

3637
04:48:06,840 --> 04:48:08,840
Rope. Um

3638
04:48:08,840 --> 04:48:10,840
I think I deposited accidentally

3639
04:48:13,909 --> 04:48:15,909
uh, yeah, um

3640
04:48:16,930 --> 04:48:17,970
Rope

3641
04:48:17,970 --> 04:48:22,770
All right, the specimen is gonna live in the sky pyramid because fuck that guy spelunker

3642
04:48:23,889 --> 04:48:33,319
Night owl potion. Okay. All right. I think it's we got we got some daylight here. Let's go

3643
04:48:34,040 --> 04:48:44,400
Time start going time to go

3644
04:48:45,439 --> 04:48:49,959
That's enough for one day

3645
04:48:49,959 --> 04:48:52,610
We will come back another time

3646
04:48:52,610 --> 04:48:54,639
time to go

3647
04:48:54,639 --> 04:48:56,159
Are you following me?

3648
04:48:56,159 --> 04:49:05,810
I'll be there

3649
04:49:05,810 --> 04:49:07,840
All right. I'm going

3650
04:49:07,840 --> 04:49:09,840
Yeah, and i'm gonna make you a grappling hook

3651
04:49:12,450 --> 04:49:14,450
You're gonna make me a grappling hook

3652
04:49:14,689 --> 04:49:16,689
What a swell guy

3653
04:49:17,029 --> 04:49:21,189
What color would you like? How do I skip forward to when you guys are in the dungeon?

3654
04:49:22,159 --> 04:49:27,279
Uh, it's it's there's only one way. I'm really sorry. There's only one way that's possible

3655
04:49:28,000 --> 04:49:29,439
You have to

3656
04:49:29,439 --> 04:49:31,439
exit the stream

3657
04:49:32,159 --> 04:49:34,740
Take a bath

3658
04:49:34,740 --> 04:49:38,979
And take a nice long bath and by the time you get back the stream might not be live

3659
04:49:40,229 --> 04:49:41,590
So then you can

3660
04:49:41,590 --> 04:49:45,270
Load this back up get to this point exactly and then skip like 30 40 minutes ahead

3661
04:49:47,990 --> 04:49:49,990
That's really i'm that's the only way

3662
04:49:50,470 --> 04:49:52,709
If there was any other way, I maybe I can help you out here

3663
04:49:53,509 --> 04:49:57,860
It's not i'm sorry. I wish there was

3664
04:50:06,369 --> 04:50:08,849
Four days and I this is the fourth stream in a row four days in a row

3665
04:50:08,849 --> 04:50:11,009
I haven't done four days in a row in like at least a couple months

3666
04:50:11,810 --> 04:50:16,000
I don't usually do four days in a row. Congratulations. Hey, thank you

3667
04:50:17,590 --> 04:50:19,330
Wow

3668
04:50:19,330 --> 04:50:20,930
That's something

3669
04:50:20,930 --> 04:50:25,540
Throw bombs at the house before the stream's over. No, i'm not gonna like ruin his game

3670
04:50:27,459 --> 04:50:30,000

3673
04:50:41,599 --> 04:50:45,279
I don't want to just ruin the entire game. Yeah, just like you wanted to play edf again

3674
04:50:46,080 --> 04:50:50,560
We did play edf like seven or eight times. Yeah, and you said we would definitely play again

3675
04:50:50,639 --> 04:50:54,400
Yes, and then what happened was uh, you were going to sleep

3676
04:50:54,959 --> 04:50:58,880
You were going to sleep at like like 10 pm your time

3677
04:51:00,849 --> 04:51:04,369
Which is six what eight pm seven pm my time

3678
04:51:05,569 --> 04:51:08,930
You were on this schedule where you were waking up at like six o'clock in the morning

3679
04:51:09,889 --> 04:51:12,580
True all right true or false statement

3680
04:51:12,740 --> 04:51:17,139
Were you on a schedule where you were waking up at like five or six am during that time you were playing again?

3681
04:51:18,400 --> 04:51:21,520
Oh me and italics did we're false question me and italics did yes

3682
04:51:22,400 --> 04:51:23,200
Oh, yeah

3683
04:51:23,200 --> 04:51:28,080
Yes, we did me and italics played that game like at least four or five more times without you there. Sorry

3684
04:51:29,200 --> 04:51:33,119
Oh my god, you you wake it up at like five and go to bed at like seven

3685
04:51:33,599 --> 04:51:37,759
I don't believe you also you put the most useless shit in this fucking box

3686
04:51:38,159 --> 04:51:41,729
I

3687
04:51:41,729 --> 04:51:43,889
We're gonna need these 40 acorns

3688
04:51:50,709 --> 04:51:53,430
I told you that I didn't know what I needed to do

3689
04:51:54,310 --> 04:51:57,110
Because if okay, let's say I trashed those acorns

3690
04:51:58,340 --> 04:52:00,340
I don't know. There's like a rain hat

3691
04:52:00,740 --> 04:52:04,819
I don't know. What if there's probably like a scenario where you'd be like, hey, dude, uh, whatever the acorns

3692
04:52:05,700 --> 04:52:10,819
Acorns, I threw them away. What dude? Uh, we need to plant. Uh, I don't know. I just put everything

3693
04:52:10,819 --> 04:52:18,630
I don't know what I need to do

3694
04:52:18,709 --> 04:52:24,610
Fuck dude ice blocks worth the money. No

3695
04:52:25,490 --> 04:52:26,819
Okay

3696
04:52:26,819 --> 04:52:41,349
And don't put them in the chest

3697
04:52:41,349 --> 04:52:45,669
I I like got rid of the mushrooms from here before and now there's more mushrooms

3698
04:52:48,689 --> 04:52:50,689
I had some extras

3699
04:52:53,650 --> 04:52:55,650
There's a copper axe in here

3700
04:52:56,529 --> 04:52:58,529
the starting hammer

3701
04:53:00,360 --> 04:53:02,360
This guy's wild

3702
04:53:03,540 --> 04:53:05,540
I don't know

3703
04:53:09,380 --> 04:53:11,380
But you can't just put me on a bike

3704
04:53:12,259 --> 04:53:16,099
With no training wheels and I don't know how to ride the bike and then you go. All right, son

3705
04:53:16,180 --> 04:53:18,180
Come on up here to the top of

3706
04:53:18,740 --> 04:53:20,740
the biggest hill in the town

3707
04:53:21,970 --> 04:53:25,090
Uh dad, I don't I should I am I ready for this? Yeah

3708
04:53:27,029 --> 04:53:31,750
And then just let me go with no training wheels going straight down like 70 miles per hour. We're ready

3709
04:53:36,099 --> 04:53:38,639
I was not ready

3710
04:53:38,639 --> 04:53:44,639
There's an immediate cut after you let go and I i'm flying down screaming going like 75 miles per hour

3711
04:53:45,279 --> 04:53:47,279
Of me in a hospital bed

3712
04:53:51,479 --> 04:53:53,479
In like a full body cast

3713
04:53:57,090 --> 04:54:02,130
It's one of those one of those like comedy scenarios where i'm in like the full body cast and i'm like trying to drink soup

3714
04:54:02,209 --> 04:54:04,209
And it's like I can't drink the soup

3715
04:54:05,759 --> 04:54:08,080
He opens the chest and clicks deposit all

3716
04:54:08,880 --> 04:54:10,240
Oh, man

3717
04:54:10,240 --> 04:54:12,290
what

3718
04:54:12,290 --> 04:54:18,159
They're riding on you. How is it? Who knows? How would they? Oh, yeah, we're in a squad

3719
04:54:20,979 --> 04:54:25,939
This is literally a spongebob episode that happens to squidward. So it's so that's what i'm saying

3720
04:54:26,740 --> 04:54:29,040
All right, teleport to me so we can

3721
04:54:32,740 --> 04:54:35,060
That I did wait does that actually happen?

3722
04:54:35,779 --> 04:54:42,099
Does anyone have a clip of squidward eating the soup? No, that does happen

3723
04:54:48,240 --> 04:54:59,990
I need to see that clip. I forgot to buy musket balls again

3724
04:55:01,509 --> 04:55:05,189
And whose fault is that? He deposits everything in the chest you forgot every time

3725
04:55:05,990 --> 04:55:11,110
So let's try this one more time. What do you think?

3726
04:55:12,349 --> 04:55:14,209
RPG RPG

3727
04:55:14,209 --> 04:55:17,650
Wait, hold on just stay there. Just you just help progress. I need to watch this

3728
04:55:19,090 --> 04:55:21,090
That's a video I need to watch

3729
04:55:21,919 --> 04:55:23,919
Do you tell me am I gonna like die?

3730
04:55:24,479 --> 04:55:28,659
I have to watch this

3731
04:55:28,659 --> 04:55:33,700
Just like just protect me for just one second while I watch this i'm protecting you with all of my heart

3732
04:55:49,490 --> 04:55:51,490
Uh, you're so protective right now

3733
04:56:09,110 --> 04:56:11,110
That's not it doesn't suit

3734
04:56:16,610 --> 04:56:19,169
That's pretty that's close enough. All right. Thank you

3735
04:56:19,889 --> 04:56:23,939
All right, can we play the game lull?

3736
04:56:24,900 --> 04:56:33,459
All right, let's speedrun this

3737
04:56:33,459 --> 04:56:38,040
Okay, but I mean like a jeremy speedrun not a star speedrun

3738
04:56:39,319 --> 04:56:41,639
Okay, so like a normal person's pace

3739
04:56:44,950 --> 04:56:46,950
Oh

3740
04:56:48,630 --> 04:56:52,740
What's that horn that everybody uses them that funny meme horn

3741
04:56:53,540 --> 04:56:58,529
the one that goes

3742
04:56:58,529 --> 04:57:00,799
Defeated what I do

3743
04:57:00,799 --> 04:57:10,150
Not down there. I am hungry, dude

3744
04:57:11,619 --> 04:57:13,619
Like come on, dude

3745
04:57:14,689 --> 04:57:16,689
You're making me play like come on, dude

3746
04:57:17,490 --> 04:57:19,330
Hey you

3747
04:57:19,330 --> 04:57:25,330
Let's just be really really clear about this you invited me to play this you were like hey play terraria with me

3748
04:57:25,409 --> 04:57:26,930
I'm like, okay

3749
04:57:26,930 --> 04:57:28,450
And now you're like

3750
04:57:28,450 --> 04:57:32,369
No, I don't want to do this anymore. Well now i've streamed for eight hours

3751
04:57:33,250 --> 04:57:35,250
And i've streamed for more than

3752
04:57:35,330 --> 04:57:37,330
More than four days in a row

3753
04:57:37,330 --> 04:57:41,650
Have you really?

3754
04:57:41,650 --> 04:57:42,689
Yeah

3755
04:57:43,009 --> 04:57:46,770
Wasn't there like a string of star streams or you only streaming like once a week

3756
04:57:47,729 --> 04:57:49,889
Are you back to like star streams every day now?

3757
04:57:51,509 --> 04:57:55,430
I don't know. I feel like i've streamed for two weeks, but that's definitely not true

3758
04:57:56,869 --> 04:58:01,200
That's the right clip. Uh, I watched it after we beat the dungeon

3759
04:58:08,099 --> 04:58:11,619
I think it's been like 10 000 days actually. Did you throw your schedule away, too?

3760
04:58:12,740 --> 04:58:16,520
My stream schedule. Yeah

3761
04:58:16,680 --> 04:58:18,680
I haven't had one in a very long time

3762
04:58:19,240 --> 04:58:20,119
Yeah

3763
04:58:20,119 --> 04:58:25,619
I like it better

3764
04:58:25,619 --> 04:58:30,500
I have like an estimation of what I think i'm going to do when I think i'm gonna stream

3765
04:58:31,299 --> 04:58:34,439
But no one really knows

3766
04:58:34,520 --> 04:58:36,520
I don't even tell people that

3767
04:58:36,520 --> 04:58:41,080
So what you just like turn it you don't have like a way for people to know when you might stream

3768
04:58:42,500 --> 04:58:44,180
Because that's how I do it here

3769
04:58:44,180 --> 04:58:46,180
It's like oh I I might stream

3770
04:58:47,060 --> 04:58:51,299
Like no, that's not true. Like I have like a day to advance usually a couple days in a row

3771
04:58:51,860 --> 04:58:57,830
I have like I don't know command. I have to ask my chat. Do you guys know what i'm gonna stream?

3772
04:58:58,790 --> 04:59:02,950
Answer. Oh, I know

3773
04:59:02,950 --> 04:59:06,400
Do I you don't have your summons?

3774
04:59:09,220 --> 04:59:11,220
um, but did I

3775
04:59:11,540 --> 04:59:14,500
Deposit my I think I deposited my oh, here you go. Take this

3776
04:59:16,400 --> 04:59:18,400
The room was torn in half by what?

3777
04:59:20,959 --> 04:59:26,400
Oh, I forgot to give you the hook

3778
04:59:26,720 --> 04:59:28,080
Yeah

3779
04:59:28,080 --> 04:59:31,439
Take that equip it and I think it's default. The button is e

3780
04:59:33,139 --> 04:59:35,330
e

3781
04:59:35,330 --> 04:59:38,610
Okay. Yeah, so like if you jump the dot like attached to the spikes

3782
04:59:39,009 --> 04:59:42,130
But if you jump and attach the ceiling it resets your jump

3783
04:59:43,009 --> 04:59:45,009
That's uh, really great

3784
04:59:45,009 --> 04:59:47,279
I wish I had one of these

3785
04:59:47,279 --> 04:59:49,279
You do

3786
04:59:50,560 --> 04:59:58,049
And you said thank you

3787
05:00:09,430 --> 05:00:13,830
Okay, i'm gonna give this to you now because I made this mistake with ashley i'm giving you

3788
05:00:14,950 --> 05:00:16,950
wormhole potion

3789
05:00:16,950 --> 05:00:18,950
What potion wormhole potion?

3790
05:00:19,349 --> 05:00:20,630
When you die

3791
05:00:20,630 --> 05:00:21,909
Thanks

3792
05:00:21,909 --> 05:00:24,470
And I thanks for reminding me i'm going to take the night out potion

3793
05:00:26,529 --> 05:00:30,529
Did that do anything it really doesn't do much

3794
05:00:35,799 --> 05:00:42,520
Why would you make my

3795
05:00:44,340 --> 05:00:46,740
Did you if you drink more than one or two of these does it work better?

3796
05:00:47,860 --> 05:00:49,540
I don't think so

3797
05:00:49,540 --> 05:01:06,900
I love this weapon. Yeah, because it sounds like you when you talk

3798
05:01:11,520 --> 05:01:17,040
Uh, all right, I can I know I know we're getting to that point where you're like done streaming

3799
05:01:19,040 --> 05:01:20,880
Because

3800
05:01:20,880 --> 05:01:27,279
Because every other comment is like stupid. Yeah, I don't you I hate your voice. Yeah, you're ugly

3801
05:01:28,709 --> 05:01:31,060
Ow

3802
05:01:31,060 --> 05:01:32,979
Oh my god

3803
05:01:32,979 --> 05:01:35,220
Did you give me the potions?

3804
05:01:35,220 --> 05:01:39,590
I did also fun fact. You uh, you can pick x those spikes

3805
05:01:44,790 --> 05:01:50,560
I don't think you gave me the potion. I had 100. Yes, you did. Thank god. You are 100 accurate

3806
05:01:51,569 --> 05:01:56,319
Okay, go get my gold

3807
05:01:56,639 --> 05:02:01,380
I can tell you're done because of how bossy you're being right now. Well, that's a huge map

3808
05:02:04,610 --> 05:02:10,180
That's actually a medium map

3809
05:02:10,259 --> 05:02:16,540
I have returned. I'm just like follow references

3810
05:02:26,689 --> 05:02:29,860
Your summons your summons dear

3811
05:02:30,740 --> 05:02:32,580
I know I

3812
05:02:32,580 --> 05:02:34,500
Look, I just got back

3813
05:02:34,500 --> 05:02:38,259
Uh, did you forget to touch the bewitching table dear? I did not there are two

3814
05:02:41,590 --> 05:02:45,959
Are you sure?

3815
05:02:45,959 --> 05:02:48,259
All right, why are you destroying this?

3816
05:02:48,259 --> 05:02:51,299
Because your gold was over there and I didn't want to walk across spikes like you did

3817
05:02:54,479 --> 05:02:56,959
You got hit by you got hit twice too. All right

3818
05:02:57,599 --> 05:02:59,360
And perfect

3819
05:02:59,360 --> 05:03:01,360
Yeah, because you had more hp than I did

3820
05:03:14,360 --> 05:03:15,319
What's

3821
05:03:15,319 --> 05:03:29,490
Can they hit us to the ground?

3822
05:03:29,490 --> 05:03:32,290
Very cool to try and open this box. I'm not gonna touch that box

3823
05:03:32,930 --> 05:03:37,959
All right. We've made it to the point where we last were killed. No, we weren't we didn't

3824
05:03:38,840 --> 05:03:41,240
You're right. We went down. You're absolutely right

3825
05:03:45,409 --> 05:03:47,409
I've actually never been wrong on my stream before

3826
05:03:50,479 --> 05:03:51,919
I don't know if you know that

3827
05:03:51,919 --> 05:03:58,950
We said lol, how are they still in the dungeon and that person that no backseat gaming?

3828
05:03:59,830 --> 05:04:29,090
When was the last time that you were backseat gamed for real? Not just like oh

3829
05:04:30,049 --> 05:04:31,729
not real, um

3830
05:04:31,729 --> 05:04:35,650
Ashley showed me a funny picture the other day. I mean maybe it was this morning

3831
05:04:36,209 --> 05:04:41,250
Where someone like had police surrounding their house and they actually threw like tear gas in their room

3832
05:04:41,889 --> 05:04:46,209
What and the the screenshot of the chat was them all backseating what they should be doing

3833
05:04:46,849 --> 05:04:50,689
Like get milk. It'll make your eyes stop burning from the gas like i'll do this like

3834
05:04:51,569 --> 05:04:53,569
Every single comment was backseat

3835
05:04:54,770 --> 05:04:57,330
The presence of running around their house not even looking at the computer

3836
05:04:59,669 --> 05:05:05,029
So to answer your question, uh, when was the last time I was backseated every day all day

3837
05:05:06,549 --> 05:05:12,869
How how what else is there? What's the other option? I kind of need to respond to how how absolutely fucked up what you just said is

3838
05:05:13,590 --> 05:05:14,389
Yeah

3839
05:05:14,389 --> 05:05:15,990
No, it's pretty fucked

3840
05:05:15,990 --> 05:05:17,990
That's fucking horrible. Um

3841
05:05:18,470 --> 05:05:19,590
but

3842
05:05:19,590 --> 05:05:21,590
Every day you're backseated

3843
05:05:24,080 --> 05:05:30,819
Yeah, but like no i'm not talking about like you you should have pressed your alt in overwatch like faster

3844
05:05:30,900 --> 05:05:33,220
Like somebody was really like trying to teach you how to play a game

3845
05:05:33,779 --> 05:05:35,779
Because you already know how to play overwatch

3846
05:05:36,389 --> 05:05:38,389
A game that you like maybe didn't know

3847
05:05:38,470 --> 05:05:40,470
What like every day?

3848
05:05:41,509 --> 05:05:44,729
I mean, doesn't that make it worse for you saying you already know how to play overwatching

3849
05:05:44,729 --> 05:05:46,729
And

3850
05:05:47,770 --> 05:05:51,689
But that's that's not backseat gaming that's just like somebody being like

3851
05:05:52,490 --> 05:05:54,490
Mean about how bad you played

3852
05:05:55,130 --> 05:05:59,990
Are they one in the same? Not really

3853
05:06:01,430 --> 05:06:03,430
They think I did something wrong, but I didn't

3854
05:06:07,799 --> 05:06:13,080
Like like today when people were telling me that those the houses weren't working because I wasn't making doors

3855
05:06:13,720 --> 05:06:15,799
Is that backseating and then it was today?

3856
05:06:19,259 --> 05:06:20,860
Every day

3857
05:06:20,939 --> 05:06:22,939
There there was today's

3858
05:06:24,520 --> 05:06:26,520
One of see you just

3859
05:06:26,599 --> 05:06:29,240
You don't read your chat enough. It's going too fast. I know

3860
05:06:30,119 --> 05:06:31,720
All the time

3861
05:06:31,720 --> 05:06:33,720
I read my chat all the time

3862
05:06:34,599 --> 05:06:38,759
Why would you type out something he should do? You know, it's a waste of your time

3863
05:06:41,619 --> 05:06:47,139
By the time like he reads like two words like 16 jupiters would have gone by

3864
05:06:52,459 --> 05:06:56,630
Uh

3865
05:06:56,630 --> 05:06:58,549
I paid very much

3866
05:06:58,549 --> 05:07:02,549
One would say the reason why I have so much trouble sometimes in games is because I am

3867
05:07:03,430 --> 05:07:05,110
engaging with the chat

3868
05:07:05,110 --> 05:07:08,549
More than I saw you playing against the pig yesterday

3869
05:07:09,590 --> 05:07:14,069
Or instead of playing the game you were reading the chat talking about how a baseball player would never do that

3870
05:07:15,349 --> 05:07:16,310
Yes

3871
05:07:16,310 --> 05:07:20,069
I was there. You know what you were I didn't know you were there. I would have said what's up

3872
05:07:23,349 --> 05:07:27,450
Every time you've seen me in real life, you've actually spit on me like first interaction

3873
05:07:29,270 --> 05:07:34,090
Now you miss understanding that I I I do I do chewing tobacco

3874
05:07:35,189 --> 05:07:40,470
It's just you might you might do every time you walk up to me. I just might be getting I'd expect it's not

3875
05:07:41,189 --> 05:07:43,189
It's not i'm spitting like at you or anything

3876
05:07:43,830 --> 05:07:45,830
I just show up at a bad time

3877
05:07:46,790 --> 05:07:49,639
What was that stat? Uh you picked it up

3878
05:07:51,279 --> 05:07:52,740
treacherous

3879
05:07:52,740 --> 05:07:54,439
sphere

3880
05:07:54,439 --> 05:07:56,439
Someone's a treacherous spear

3881
05:07:57,400 --> 05:07:59,000
What?

3882
05:07:59,080 --> 05:08:01,080
57 melee damage on this

3883
05:08:01,799 --> 05:08:03,400
really nice

3884
05:08:03,400 --> 05:08:09,000
Good in my small escape of this game would I have knowledge of the last few hours like at this point?

3885
05:08:09,080 --> 05:08:11,080
The highest i'm seeing are like 30s

3886
05:08:12,360 --> 05:08:14,360
But also it's one of the awkward weapons. I don't want to use

3887
05:08:15,400 --> 05:08:17,959
What if it does that much damage? I don't give a shit

3888
05:08:18,119 --> 05:08:24,680
Remember that deleted germa or star video where they met in real life and germa punched him in the face

3889
05:08:27,029 --> 05:08:30,950
And we like we've gotten over that so that's why the video is that's why the video was deleted

3890
05:08:31,349 --> 05:08:33,349
Because we've like kind of gotten over that

3891
05:08:33,830 --> 05:08:38,279
There's a lot of enemies over here. I mean like too many for me to handle

3892
05:08:39,080 --> 05:08:42,279
I'm coming with my 57 godly mace

3893
05:08:43,240 --> 05:08:45,240
That sphere is amazing. Should I give it a try?

3894
05:08:50,549 --> 05:08:56,220
Whoa, it does it shoots the things that I shoot. Wait, what did you get? Oh

3895
05:08:57,900 --> 05:09:04,540
I got double like shooting stars now. Oh, is that your does that count? Hey chat does that count as a sentry?

3896
05:09:06,380 --> 05:09:08,860
That's pretty nice

3897
05:09:08,860 --> 05:09:10,860
That's amazing

3898
05:09:13,349 --> 05:09:16,630
Yeah, there's some equipment later where you'll be able to have like four of those out

3899
05:09:17,509 --> 05:09:19,689
I gotta put this in it. This is like

3900
05:09:20,169 --> 05:09:22,569
It's broken. I don't know what it's doing. It's doing it through the walls

3901
05:09:29,590 --> 05:09:31,590
Wow, you win the internet

3902
05:09:36,040 --> 05:09:38,040
Oh, I hate that

3903
05:09:38,680 --> 05:09:42,279
That's like the worst thing that's the worst thing ever i've got one too

3904
05:09:43,799 --> 05:09:45,799
Oh man, you win the internet. Oh

3905
05:09:52,380 --> 05:09:54,380
But you have one too

3906
05:09:55,750 --> 05:09:59,830
This is fun. I gotta see I told you you should have stayed for an extra like 10 minutes

3907
05:10:00,790 --> 05:10:02,790
Yeah, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten

3908
05:10:04,580 --> 05:10:08,279
The uber gear from the uber dungeon

3909
05:10:13,450 --> 05:10:16,009
Are we farming for anything in particular or are we just kind of sitting around?

3910
05:10:16,810 --> 05:10:18,970
um golden keys so that

3911
05:10:19,770 --> 05:10:21,770
We open one of these chests and get a shadow key

3912
05:10:23,259 --> 05:10:24,459
interesting

3913
05:10:24,459 --> 05:10:26,459
Is what I want

3914
05:10:26,779 --> 05:10:39,099
If you only need one shadow key to open every shadow chest after that and there's a whole bunch of them on the far left

3915
05:10:39,099 --> 05:10:41,099
side of the map

3916
05:10:41,099 --> 05:10:43,099
There's so much shit down here

3917
05:10:46,389 --> 05:10:48,889
Uh, there's a key right there

3918
05:10:48,889 --> 05:10:53,180
Where I got one is this one is this uh chest not open?

3919
05:10:54,380 --> 05:10:57,740
Uh, the chest is locked up. I feel it looks different

3920
05:10:59,349 --> 05:11:01,349
Now i've already opened this one's open already

3921
05:11:01,909 --> 05:11:04,470
midnight oil

3922
05:11:04,470 --> 05:11:06,790
Silver bar magic missile. I already have one of these

3923
05:11:07,509 --> 05:11:10,549
I I don't know where to take it. Maybe we don't take the other magic missile

3924
05:11:11,909 --> 05:11:15,430
Uh, my my inventory is so full. Mine's pretty full, too

3925
05:11:17,619 --> 05:11:19,619
I bet germa has read it open right now

3926
05:11:20,180 --> 05:11:32,090
No, I don't

3927
05:11:34,650 --> 05:11:48,500
Turn on screen capture right now. No, all right. Let's keep going. I think it's still good

3928
05:11:55,590 --> 05:11:59,110
Can you cast it real quick

3929
05:11:59,110 --> 05:12:04,069
I think we can only have one between us, which is doesn't make any sense. That's odd that they

3930
05:12:06,900 --> 05:12:09,529
Seems like a patch

3931
05:12:09,529 --> 05:12:16,580
Like this has been patched

3932
05:12:16,580 --> 05:12:19,380
How much further down are we going? This is really far down

3933
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:32,919
jump with that thing

3934
05:12:32,919 --> 05:12:35,000
Ancient necro helmet. I didn't know those

3935
05:12:37,720 --> 05:12:43,720
Update my facebook page. I have not logged into that germa 95 facebook in probably five years

3936
05:12:44,200 --> 05:12:50,630
I don't use facebook. Did you just throw that sword away?

3937
05:12:51,909 --> 05:12:53,110
No

3938
05:12:53,110 --> 05:13:04,389
If you follow germa on facebook the cool thing about it is that you get to be one of the germs

3939
05:13:06,680 --> 05:13:10,840
Yeah, no, my favorite part is when I join star's congregation of smashing gents

3940
05:13:12,279 --> 05:13:19,400
My favorite part is when I clearly make the mistake of naming my group that and then you name yours something even worse after me

3941
05:13:20,840 --> 05:13:22,119
uh

3942
05:13:22,119 --> 05:13:25,500
What was yours the inhumane psychopath?

3943
05:13:28,360 --> 05:13:35,639
Fun fact fun fact. Yes fun fact years later. I determined how fucking terrible and awful of a name that is

3944
05:13:36,680 --> 05:13:40,520
That I I tried to delete it, but you can't delete groups

3945
05:13:41,580 --> 05:13:46,139
valve remember we talked about valve has like 2019 paint with the 2005 engine

3946
05:13:47,259 --> 05:13:49,259
You cannot delete a group

3947
05:13:49,669 --> 05:13:52,470
If you make a steam group do it right now and have a hundred people join

3948
05:13:53,029 --> 05:13:56,069
All of them have to leave before you delete it. It can't be deleted

3949
05:14:04,220 --> 05:14:11,020
That's why I support the epic steam store epic steams steam steams steams steam

3950
05:14:15,020 --> 05:14:17,020
All right, I don't want to die down here

3951
05:14:19,240 --> 05:14:21,750
Steam

3952
05:14:21,750 --> 05:14:23,750
Uh, did you open that chest?

3953
05:14:24,069 --> 05:14:28,709
This one over here is not open that I don't have anything in here. I I couldn't even see what isn't being attacked

3954
05:14:30,869 --> 05:14:33,509
That's some stupid staff. It's a it's a shitty stuff

3955
05:14:35,349 --> 05:14:37,029
Uh, but anyways

3956
05:14:37,029 --> 05:14:38,790
Yes, I realized

3957
05:14:38,790 --> 05:14:44,409
Yours was congregation of smashing gents and I was like, oh i'll have mine be the inhumane psychopath

3958
05:14:48,500 --> 05:14:50,500
I can't remember why it was

3959
05:14:51,799 --> 05:14:54,360
Someone started it and was not me. I think it might have been shivvy

3960
05:14:55,240 --> 05:14:57,479
Of just like having really stupid group names

3961
05:14:58,680 --> 05:15:04,919
It's like shivvy's club of awesome. I believe is what it is. If that is correct, I might be wrong, but it might be

3962
05:15:05,799 --> 05:15:07,799
I think it is someone else

3963
05:15:12,470 --> 05:15:18,950
No one has a group name though, I can tell you that i'm sorry, but I I think I was against the uh, the grain there

3964
05:15:19,909 --> 05:15:22,889
with my group name

3965
05:15:22,889 --> 05:15:25,130
Inhumane psychopaths, you're very proud of that

3966
05:15:25,369 --> 05:15:31,770
No, i'm just saying it wasn't like the smashing gents or the the cool group or the cool group of dudes

3967
05:15:32,409 --> 05:15:34,409
Okay

3968
05:15:34,569 --> 05:15:36,330
Good job

3969
05:15:36,330 --> 05:15:38,490
Good job. So I made another group

3970
05:15:39,450 --> 05:15:41,209
Because I was like, I don't like that group that groups

3971
05:15:41,209 --> 05:15:44,169
I don't like that name and I want to like make i'm gonna actually do stuff with this group

3972
05:15:44,569 --> 05:15:46,569
And I changed it to even worse

3973
05:15:47,049 --> 05:15:49,049
What do you think I changed it to?

3974
05:15:49,900 --> 05:15:53,080
I don't remember I went so

3975
05:15:53,860 --> 05:15:55,000
generic

3976
05:15:55,000 --> 05:15:57,000
Just safe name

3977
05:16:02,009 --> 05:16:04,009
Jerma's group. Yes

3978
05:16:04,259 --> 05:16:06,259
Really

3979
05:16:06,500 --> 05:16:11,619
I don't know. I I was I don't know. I I went from one extreme to the other

3980
05:16:15,479 --> 05:16:20,040
I don't think that steam group has a name. I think it's just jerma's group

3981
05:16:20,759 --> 05:16:27,290
Can we even cut through this place?

3982
05:16:28,279 --> 05:16:30,439
Uh, I don't think our pickaxes can do that yet

3983
05:16:31,400 --> 05:16:33,400
Oh, no, I can and then I

3984
05:16:34,520 --> 05:16:37,720
I haven't used that group and I can't remove it people like hey dude

3985
05:16:37,799 --> 05:16:40,919
You're like your steam group's like all fucked up and there's a bunch of like dumb shit

3986
05:16:41,000 --> 05:16:45,000
And it's like all kinds of like crazy like discussions that have to be removed. I wish I could

3987
05:16:48,659 --> 05:16:51,139
Steam does not allow me to delete these groups

3988
05:16:52,020 --> 05:16:57,619
And like having a steam group that can be posted on just means there's going to be like a whole bunch of people speaking

3989
05:16:57,700 --> 05:17:03,939
Russian and saying like weird shit all the time or just like virus links. Yeah virus links and like

3990
05:17:04,500 --> 05:17:06,709
Like

3991
05:17:06,709 --> 05:17:10,470
And then I was like, oh I have moderators a long time ago, by the way

3992
05:17:10,470 --> 05:17:12,470
This is at least five years ago four or five years ago

3993
05:17:13,349 --> 05:17:17,669
Maybe you should have moderators for that and then it would just be impossible to keep up with

3994
05:17:22,619 --> 05:17:26,139
Can we not break through these? I guess we can we can

3995
05:17:29,990 --> 05:17:34,279
We're almost at the bottom of it

3996
05:17:34,279 --> 05:17:35,720
I'm digging down

3997
05:17:35,720 --> 05:17:42,040
Let's go to hell, but let's earn it this time

3998
05:17:52,119 --> 05:17:54,119
Uh, oh, uh, yeah, don't let him in here

3999
05:17:56,979 --> 05:17:59,139
Keep digging. Hold on. I need to like protect us

4000
05:18:04,419 --> 05:18:06,419
Those shadow keys never found one

4001
05:18:20,310 --> 05:18:22,630
We have to earn our hell is what they're saying

4002
05:18:23,270 --> 05:18:26,569
Earn your hell

4003
05:18:26,569 --> 05:18:28,409
What is that?

4004
05:18:28,409 --> 05:18:30,409
Why is it is that helping us mine?

4005
05:18:31,130 --> 05:18:36,709
No

4006
05:18:36,709 --> 05:18:40,520
Oh god

4007
05:18:40,520 --> 05:18:45,639
Do you see that thing below us? Yeah, what about it? If we kill it the wall of flesh will summon. Let's do it

4008
05:18:46,200 --> 05:18:50,599
Let's no preparation wall of flesh right now. Why did you just drop that? What are you doing?

4009
05:18:51,479 --> 05:18:53,400
Why did you do that?

4010
05:18:53,400 --> 05:18:55,400
you just like

4011
05:18:56,759 --> 05:19:02,840
You just like dropped me out and I had like no health you better stay alive so I can teleport to you with the worm

4012
05:19:03,560 --> 05:19:05,560
Oh

4013
05:19:09,380 --> 05:19:22,459
Where did the uh, where'd the voodoo doll go? Also, this is not regular health stone. This is oh my god

4014
05:19:22,779 --> 05:19:24,779
Warn me. Oh my god, dude

4015
05:19:31,669 --> 05:19:33,669
Oh, it's because I have a dangerous sense potion

4016
05:19:35,819 --> 05:19:39,270
Oh

4017
05:19:40,229 --> 05:19:41,189
No

4018
05:19:41,189 --> 05:19:43,189
Are there any more of those in the inventory?

4019
05:19:44,119 --> 05:19:47,400
I don't I don't think so. How do I make one? How do you make them?

4020
05:19:48,569 --> 05:19:50,889
I don't I don't think so. Oh, I got it

4021
05:19:52,569 --> 05:19:56,090
I think this is where we call it. No, how do you make one?

4022
05:19:57,049 --> 05:19:58,330
I don't know

4023
05:19:58,330 --> 05:20:01,130
And we definitely don't have it because we've been deleting everything

4024
05:20:07,060 --> 05:20:09,060
And look, i'm not even there anymore. No

4025
05:20:09,540 --> 05:20:11,540
No, I wanted to see it. Oh

4026
05:20:12,500 --> 05:20:16,310
I didn't summon it

4027
05:20:16,310 --> 05:20:18,310
Oh now that we we earned it

4028
05:20:18,779 --> 05:20:20,779
I didn't I I guess I

4029
05:20:21,580 --> 05:20:25,819
I don't know why my brain just thought me teleporting over there was going to teleport me to a safe place and not just like

4030
05:20:25,900 --> 05:20:29,099
Where you are? I I didn't think of it either, but it was like the moment I was

4031
05:20:31,049 --> 05:20:31,930
Yeah

4032
05:20:31,930 --> 05:20:40,389
What about the cheat hole?

4033
05:20:40,389 --> 05:20:42,869
Cheat hole. Let's go. You can get spirit droplets right now

4034
05:20:43,669 --> 05:20:57,779
cheat hole

4035
05:20:57,779 --> 05:21:00,740
Uh, oh don't tell germa but

4036
05:21:01,860 --> 05:21:07,860
That you can craft the armor now that gives you two minions and the bonus is probably like a third

4037
05:21:08,900 --> 05:21:10,259
Shouldn't have told me

4038
05:21:10,259 --> 05:21:20,819
All right. So where should we be stopping?

4039
05:21:20,900 --> 05:21:27,060
Just right here what we were last time

4040
05:21:29,060 --> 05:21:31,060
Um, wait, what do you mean?

4041
05:21:31,139 --> 05:21:35,000
down the cheat hole

4042
05:21:35,000 --> 05:21:38,650
I think I think we should stop

4043
05:21:38,650 --> 05:21:42,490
Oh, you see because we are very close to you getting okay number one

4044
05:21:42,490 --> 05:21:48,330
It's a 38 damage ghost summon and then you can summon like a whole like ghost necromancer

4045
05:21:49,689 --> 05:21:51,610
Minion set

4046
05:21:51,610 --> 05:21:53,770
There's a whole like we could all go and do that

4047
05:21:54,330 --> 05:21:58,409
But if we do it now, then you're not going to play next week and we can make saturday terraria day

4048
05:21:59,450 --> 05:22:01,529
And you you want to keep saturday terraria night?

4049
05:22:02,090 --> 05:22:03,529
Terraria day day

4050
05:22:03,529 --> 05:22:05,529
Terraria day, okay

4051
05:22:05,610 --> 05:22:11,849
I'm gonna do it

4052
05:22:11,849 --> 05:22:17,720
Ow bill my wife is saying wall in all cap

4053
05:22:19,159 --> 05:22:21,240
No, no, no wall

4054
05:22:22,520 --> 05:22:24,520
Maybe ignore her ignore her

4055
05:22:26,360 --> 05:22:31,560
Das fridays terraria saturdays that's gonna have to change. What is going on over here?

4056
05:22:32,759 --> 05:22:34,759
This leaf shield thing. What is this?

4057
05:22:35,959 --> 05:22:38,119
Uh when enemies are near she does that

4058
05:22:39,080 --> 05:22:41,080
Oh, and it's like a hell for jen

4059
05:22:42,599 --> 05:22:44,599
Yeah, I I will play terraria again

4060
05:22:45,799 --> 05:22:47,799
Definitely interesting enough to do it again

4061
05:22:48,439 --> 05:22:50,840
You haven't even gotten a hard mode yet kid. I know

4062
05:22:53,740 --> 05:22:57,450
fucking kid

4063
05:22:57,450 --> 05:22:59,450
But yeah, um

4064
05:23:04,950 --> 05:23:06,150
That's it, right?

4065
05:23:06,150 --> 05:23:08,630
Yeah, now it's just the only thing left to do is talk political

4066
05:23:09,909 --> 05:23:11,909
Well, the only thing left to do is

4067
05:23:12,470 --> 05:23:14,630
Five and a half hours like five to six hours. That's that's good

4068
05:23:17,900 --> 05:23:20,860
This is a bonus stream for me it's a regular stream for you

4069
05:23:25,369 --> 05:23:27,369
Hold on. There's like get those stars

4070
05:23:27,990 --> 05:23:29,590
so how does

4071
05:23:29,590 --> 05:23:33,900
So if I take this character into my own terraria game, it's going to be just empty, right?

4072
05:23:34,700 --> 05:23:37,099
Yep, this is on your local drive, right?

4073
05:23:40,860 --> 05:23:45,659
If I open a new terraria game, just not multiplayer will I have to be a level zero?

4074
05:23:46,700 --> 05:23:50,220
Shitty you can join with that with this character again

4075
05:23:50,380 --> 05:23:54,060
But everything in that world will need to be done again like how we feed it

4076
05:23:54,060 --> 05:23:58,939
The skeleton gets to go into the dungeon like that hasn't happened in that world. You have to beat him again

4077
05:23:59,340 --> 05:24:01,340
If you want to continue playing

4078
05:24:01,900 --> 05:24:03,900
I can just like leave it open

4079
05:24:05,259 --> 05:24:09,180
Uh, no, I probably i'm just gonna i'm gonna like do some reading

4080
05:24:10,139 --> 05:24:12,439
I'm gonna mana crystal. So

4081
05:24:13,240 --> 05:24:23,959
My max metal if you can't use them. Yeah, then give me the ones you haven't used

4082
05:24:25,659 --> 05:24:30,220
I'm gonna do a little bit of reading so i'm more knowledgeable next time at least like by two percent

4083
05:24:32,200 --> 05:24:34,040
Okay

4084
05:24:34,040 --> 05:24:38,919
And do you do you actually want to do this again like on saturday like next saturday just do no

4085
05:24:38,919 --> 05:24:41,080
I was I was joking. Well, I don't know

4086
05:24:41,720 --> 05:24:46,680
Sometimes you say things and then you you you write like in discord after the streams of it

4087
05:24:46,680 --> 05:24:48,759
You write like you really think that i'm gonna play with you

4088
05:24:50,759 --> 05:24:52,759
That's definitely happened

4089
05:24:53,479 --> 05:24:57,159
And then I have to pretend like oh no something that something came up. I don't know what happened

4090
05:24:59,099 --> 05:25:01,099
All right. Well, i'll i'll just see you later

4091
05:25:02,630 --> 05:25:05,349
Have a well-deserved rest after eight hours stream

4092
05:25:06,310 --> 05:25:08,310
Thank you, honey

4093
05:25:08,759 --> 05:25:12,840
Oh my god, I hear more stars and you didn't give me the mana crystal that you didn't use I just threw out

4094
05:25:12,919 --> 05:25:14,200
Yes, I did

4095
05:25:14,200 --> 05:25:16,119
I just gave it to you

4096
05:25:16,119 --> 05:25:18,119
No, you did I threw it right down

4097
05:25:19,930 --> 05:25:21,930
I want more

4098
05:25:22,009 --> 05:25:24,009
I will see you guys. Um later

4099
05:25:24,569 --> 05:25:26,090
we'll do the

4100
05:25:26,090 --> 05:25:28,090
the end of the stream here, but

4101
05:25:28,090 --> 05:25:29,529
Goodbye star

4102
05:25:29,529 --> 05:25:31,369
Always a pleasure

4103
05:25:31,369 --> 05:25:33,049
We'll see you next time

4104
05:25:33,049 --> 05:25:35,049
for terraria

4105
05:25:35,130 --> 05:25:39,860
He's still on the call. I thought he's gonna do his thing that he does

4106
05:25:40,259 --> 05:25:42,259
No

4107
05:25:42,259 --> 05:25:43,700
I don't do anything

4108
05:25:43,700 --> 05:25:45,459
Where you just you're gone

4109
05:25:45,540 --> 05:25:50,740
I'm going are you actually gonna say goodbye to my stream for the first time in like four streams

4110
05:25:51,779 --> 05:25:57,139
Goodbye germa's stream. I hope that you had I hope you enjoyed the playthrough of terraria

4111
05:25:57,700 --> 05:26:01,459
And I hope you look forward to the continuing episodes that will result from it

4112
05:26:02,180 --> 05:26:03,619
I don't think

4113
05:26:03,619 --> 05:26:08,659
You have ever done that in at least the last like seven streams. You've always just kind of been gone somehow

4114
05:26:09,939 --> 05:26:11,139
There you go

4115
05:26:11,139 --> 05:26:13,139
I think you're wrong. I'm not

4116
05:26:14,150 --> 05:26:18,950
I think I left one time as a joke. No the last three or four times. It's been a joke

4117
05:26:21,349 --> 05:26:23,590
You and you've even turned your stream off

4118
05:26:24,630 --> 05:26:27,669
And like ceased all contact for the rest of the day

4119
05:26:28,310 --> 05:26:32,540
You dedicated i'll give you that

4120
05:26:33,560 --> 05:26:36,279
Uh lang says germa usually mutes me. Oh, okay

4121
05:26:38,229 --> 05:26:39,189
Thank you

4122
05:26:39,189 --> 05:26:40,970
You're not muted now, are you?

4123
05:26:40,970 --> 05:26:44,650
All right. Well, goodbye. I don't do I have to how many times do I have to do it? Are you satisfied?

4124
05:26:45,369 --> 05:26:51,290
One more we'll do it. I think goodbye germa and germa's chat. I hope you enjoyed this. We'll play again

4125
05:26:51,689 --> 05:26:56,830
Goodbye star and stars when I say things it's not a joke and i'm not sarcastic

4126
05:26:57,689 --> 05:27:00,250
Actually mean the thing

4127
05:27:00,250 --> 05:27:04,009
So I 100 mean it when I say what about hillary's emails?

4128
05:27:11,799 --> 05:27:13,799
I'm like just realizing right now that like that

4129
05:27:14,599 --> 05:27:19,000
That that joke that came up like four or five times would have been funny like three years ago

4130
05:27:23,700 --> 05:27:25,700
what we were on that for like

4131
05:27:26,619 --> 05:27:31,430
At least 10 minutes. All right, give me the spongebob soup thing

4132
05:27:47,819 --> 05:27:49,819
There's even a time stick

4133
05:27:51,500 --> 05:27:54,220
This is it i'm so ready for this you have no idea

4134
05:27:56,619 --> 05:27:58,779
I've never been more ready for something in my whole life

4135
05:27:59,340 --> 05:28:10,389
Why is it not showing?

4136
05:28:11,110 --> 05:28:14,389
How about some soup on your best day ever?

4137
05:28:18,139 --> 05:28:20,139
It's a little hot

4138
05:28:20,540 --> 05:28:24,310
Oh

4139
05:28:27,669 --> 05:28:31,830
I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever

4140
05:28:33,029 --> 05:28:35,029
How about some music on your best day ever?

4141
05:28:36,630 --> 05:28:38,630
Music isn't best either

4142
05:28:38,630 --> 05:28:45,830
But what is best is what we save for last the one surefire thing to make your best day ever

4143
05:28:46,310 --> 05:29:05,880
All right, that's enough. I'm gonna get in trouble. That's enough. What a cliffhanger. Just you go watch that episode if you want to see what happens

4144
05:29:08,040 --> 05:29:10,229
But i'll see you guys later

4145
05:29:10,229 --> 05:29:12,869
I will be back in a few days

4146
05:29:14,860 --> 05:29:16,860
I think we're gonna start next week

4147
05:29:17,500 --> 05:29:18,700
with

4148
05:29:18,700 --> 05:29:22,099
The gta casino

4149
05:29:22,099 --> 05:29:24,259
It came out. I kind of have to play that

4150
05:29:25,369 --> 05:29:27,930
How could I not do the gta online casino?

4151
05:29:45,909 --> 05:29:46,950
when

4152
05:29:46,950 --> 05:29:48,950
So this would be let's say saturday

4153
05:29:49,750 --> 05:29:54,549
Sunday monday, but we'll come back on wednesday. We'll do the same thing. We did this last week here

4154
05:29:55,509 --> 05:29:59,139
We'll do a like wednesday

4155
05:29:59,779 --> 05:30:02,819
I don't have a schedule but wednesday to saturday sounds like

4156
05:30:03,540 --> 05:30:05,779
Especially with this new terraria saturday thing

4157
05:30:06,580 --> 05:30:09,979
wednesday thursday friday saturday

4158
05:30:10,549 --> 05:30:20,060
Same thing we did this week saturday whisper dos. Well, we can't we have to change that up

4159
05:30:20,779 --> 05:30:25,540
Why am I gonna say hey star? No, we we're playing uh terraria on fridays now

4160
05:30:26,419 --> 05:30:28,500
Uh, it's it says he he invited me

4161
05:30:29,299 --> 05:30:31,220
You don't switch that around

4162
05:30:31,220 --> 05:30:36,659
You know, you don't go to somebody's house when they invite you to their house and then like change their decorations and move their furniture around

4163
05:30:47,369 --> 05:30:49,799
You if you do

4164
05:30:49,799 --> 05:30:52,060
Don't do that anymore

4165
05:30:52,060 --> 05:30:54,060
But i'll see you guys on wednesday

4166
05:30:56,069 --> 05:30:57,590
Thanks for watching

4167
05:30:57,590 --> 05:31:00,259
Terraria is actually pretty fun

4168
05:31:00,259 --> 05:31:05,939
It's uh, I get to experience this because I never really i've tried to open it up a couple times. I got it on ipad

4169
05:31:06,500 --> 05:31:08,340
weirdly enough

4170
05:31:08,340 --> 05:31:11,540
And maybe put like 30 minutes into it before I realized I needed to

4171
05:31:12,180 --> 05:31:15,299
Put a lot of time into it and I really didn't want to lie in bed

4172
05:31:16,020 --> 05:31:18,340
It's like five six seven straight hours

4173
05:31:18,900 --> 05:31:24,979
Playing it on ipad

4174
05:31:24,979 --> 05:31:27,220
So I was I don't really want to do this and then I never did it

4175
05:31:27,860 --> 05:31:29,860
I never really got into it. I didn't

4176
05:31:30,180 --> 05:31:33,060
Put the time that is necessary to get something out of it

4177
05:31:38,229 --> 05:31:42,229
I don't know. Maybe then maybe we'll see if anybody else wants to along the way jumped in and play it or something

4178
05:31:52,970 --> 05:31:58,040
You know, but we we're gonna do the bits

4179
05:31:58,680 --> 05:32:00,439
Shouldn't take us too long

4180
05:32:00,819 --> 05:32:02,419
Is the stream over? Yeah

4181
05:32:02,419 --> 05:32:05,380
I think that's a pretty good. I don't really have anything that i'd want to start

4182
05:32:08,069 --> 05:32:09,669
Five and a half hours in

4183
05:32:09,669 --> 05:32:12,759
I'd rather just uh start pressure on wednesday

4184
05:32:15,380 --> 05:32:17,380
Why can't I play good games?

4185
05:32:17,380 --> 05:32:19,779
Isn't terraria one of like the most critically acclaimed

4186
05:32:20,580 --> 05:32:22,580
Games like that that exists

4187
05:32:27,799 --> 05:32:30,099
What it is, right?

4188
05:32:32,069 --> 05:32:37,830
Uh, if you would ask somebody is terraria a good game, I would say probably eight or nine out of ten people would probably say yes

4189
05:32:39,770 --> 05:32:42,169
Isn't that as not a good what classifies a good game?

4190
05:32:47,319 --> 05:32:49,720
How many people buy it? How many people review it? How many?

4191
05:32:50,279 --> 05:33:05,049
I don't know

4192
05:33:05,049 --> 05:33:06,409
But let's go back

4193
05:33:06,409 --> 05:33:10,409
I'll see you guys on wednesday. Thanks for watching call to personality. Thanks for the two dollars fifty cents

4194
05:33:11,750 --> 05:33:16,470
I'm playing shadow run with friends. So i'll have to watch the vod wanted to send bits your way anyway

4195
05:33:17,270 --> 05:33:19,830
Enjoy the game with your buds build lots of

4196
05:33:20,389 --> 05:33:21,509
uh

4197
05:33:21,509 --> 05:33:23,509
Call me for you. Call me block

4198
05:33:24,229 --> 05:33:26,139
The calm what does that mean?

4199
05:33:26,139 --> 05:33:35,770
the houses

4200
05:33:35,770 --> 05:33:41,189
oh

4201
05:33:41,189 --> 05:33:43,189
Why why why is that?

4202
05:33:43,990 --> 05:33:46,790
That's just what you that's what you you just put people in like

4203
05:33:48,900 --> 05:33:53,959
the shoe box

4204
05:33:53,959 --> 05:33:55,959
I would just let them roam free

4205
05:34:00,459 --> 05:34:03,099
Hey halios. Thanks for 280. Happy birthday germa

4206
05:34:04,979 --> 05:34:16,500
You're a little a little off, but uh, thank you so much. Appreciate it. We had a lot of money come in earlier. We

4207
05:34:17,299 --> 05:34:22,419
grabbed them all but thank you to uh timmy and chunky baloney for your 50 dollar

4208
05:34:23,060 --> 05:34:25,060
Bit donations that came in a few hours ago

4209
05:34:25,540 --> 05:34:27,540
It's a lot of fucking money. Thank you

4210
05:34:32,500 --> 05:34:35,939
The continued generosity of some of you guys is mind-blowing

4211
05:34:38,040 --> 05:34:43,479
No one's under any obligation to pay this stream any money ever yet. Some people do a lot and

4212
05:34:44,200 --> 05:34:46,279
I just thank you. I wish there was more I could say

4213
05:34:55,750 --> 05:34:57,750
But let's uh do the credits

4214
05:34:59,849 --> 05:35:04,200
Throw them up there. Here they come. Here comes those quick

4215
05:35:05,340 --> 05:35:09,500
Use all the subs and resubs and get the subs that happened during the course of the stream

4216
05:35:10,459 --> 05:35:11,900
Thanks to all of you

4217
05:35:11,900 --> 05:35:15,779
as always

4218
05:35:15,779 --> 05:35:17,779
we have a few more bits to do but

4219
05:35:17,939 --> 05:35:26,099
Get it up there now. All right

4220
05:35:26,099 --> 05:35:28,500
Thank you to freudian weapon for the five dollars

4221
05:35:29,540 --> 05:35:32,419
Gosh darn it. Germa. You're really making me want to pick terraria back up

4222
05:35:33,299 --> 05:35:39,080
But on another note, do you plan on streaming mario maker 2 again? I've got a level in the works. That's sure to knock your socks off

4223
05:35:42,619 --> 05:35:45,209
Yeah, i'll do that next week

4224
05:35:45,209 --> 05:35:47,849
I'll try to do we'll do the gta casino

4225
05:35:48,889 --> 05:35:52,810
We'll do another sam and max episode. We'll do mario maker 2 again

4226
05:35:55,020 --> 05:35:57,020
And then I really want to start to

4227
05:35:57,590 --> 05:35:58,869
over the next

4228
05:35:58,869 --> 05:36:00,150
week or so

4229
05:36:00,150 --> 05:36:03,029
Try to get this dumb highlights magazine stream

4230
05:36:03,830 --> 05:36:05,830
rules and stuff started so

4231
05:36:06,069 --> 05:36:07,270
that'll

4232
05:36:07,270 --> 05:36:08,860
pretty

4233
05:36:08,860 --> 05:36:09,900
Pribbly

4234
05:36:09,900 --> 05:36:11,900
Uh come out shortly

4235
05:36:12,139 --> 05:36:28,250
So that's what you can expect the next week when I come back. I think i've had enough break from mario maker 2 to

4236
05:36:29,270 --> 05:36:33,020
Come back and lose my mind again

4237
05:36:33,020 --> 05:36:35,740
Uh, thank you to you. You follow up

4238
05:36:36,619 --> 05:36:38,619
You follow up for the five dollars

4239
05:36:38,939 --> 05:36:43,259
I say love the stranger, but you always make my day better but something needs to happen

4240
05:36:44,220 --> 05:36:45,720
About the

4241
05:36:45,720 --> 05:36:52,380
Trans slur arguments that happen almost every stream. It really hurts seeing such toxic debates spark from such a generous and fantastic streamer like you

4242
05:36:53,099 --> 05:36:55,500
Uh, love you lots jerma. Sorry about the chat misbehaving today

4243
05:36:57,849 --> 05:36:59,849
Yeah, honestly, I think it's

4244
05:37:00,009 --> 05:37:06,340
Everybody kind of just needs to relax

4245
05:37:07,380 --> 05:37:09,380
and there's really no reason

4246
05:37:10,470 --> 05:37:12,419
to

4247
05:37:12,419 --> 05:37:14,419
Get angry or upset about something like that

4248
05:37:15,909 --> 05:37:17,189
We're here

4249
05:37:17,189 --> 05:37:18,950
To just hang out and have a good time

4250
05:37:18,950 --> 05:37:21,319
We're just here to have fun. We're here to relax

4251
05:37:23,110 --> 05:37:25,110
It there really shouldn't be

4252
05:37:25,860 --> 05:37:30,180
like that kind of fighting like that in the chat and I I I don't really want to

4253
05:37:30,900 --> 05:37:35,130
Press too hard on this

4254
05:37:35,130 --> 05:37:37,130
But we're here for a very specific reason

4255
05:37:39,099 --> 05:37:40,860
i'm not here

4256
05:37:40,860 --> 05:37:42,060
to

4257
05:37:42,060 --> 05:37:43,099
really

4258
05:37:43,099 --> 05:37:45,419
Go over anything else besides us to

4259
05:37:46,060 --> 05:37:48,060
Forget the world around us

4260
05:37:48,459 --> 05:37:50,619
Enjoy a game and hang out together

4261
05:37:52,650 --> 05:38:01,189
Try to be nicer to each other

4262
05:38:01,189 --> 05:38:05,909
Now that doesn't mean well, everything has to be everything's positive everything has to be positive all day every day

4263
05:38:05,909 --> 05:38:07,909
Everything's positive positive positive

4264
05:38:08,900 --> 05:38:10,979
But being like nice to be nice to each other

4265
05:38:13,270 --> 05:38:14,950
We fuck around here a lot

4266
05:38:14,950 --> 05:38:16,150
We really do

4267
05:38:16,150 --> 05:38:24,009
but there's a difference between like fucking around and like being angry with each other and fucking hating each other

4268
05:38:25,720 --> 05:38:27,720
Now I don't think that's necessarily been

4269
05:38:28,439 --> 05:38:38,599
too far down there, but this stream is

4270
05:38:39,700 --> 05:38:41,700
a very very very

4271
05:38:42,549 --> 05:38:45,349
I don't really talk about

4272
05:38:45,349 --> 05:38:47,349
what I believe in

4273
05:38:47,509 --> 05:38:51,270
The things that I care about in politics, maybe the politics joke earlier, right?

4274
05:38:51,270 --> 05:38:56,229
But we like that and this is obviously politics and social issues. I don't really do that

4275
05:39:05,639 --> 05:39:09,799
If there's ever an avenue for us to really start to discuss those things then that's when it'll happen

4276
05:39:16,310 --> 05:39:21,500
But try to be like better to each other and nicer to each other

4277
05:39:21,979 --> 05:39:24,540
We don't have to have these big arguments like that in chat

4278
05:39:25,180 --> 05:39:28,009
and I try to

4279
05:39:28,009 --> 05:39:30,970
Because here's another part right once you start to I don't want to fan

4280
05:39:31,689 --> 05:39:34,650
The flames because you know, obviously putting it in sub only is easy to uh

4281
05:39:35,290 --> 05:39:37,849
To kind of oh, but let's just like cool it down for a little bit

4282
05:39:38,729 --> 05:40:00,250
Yeah, well, that's why I said that's why I separated

4283
05:40:01,770 --> 05:40:04,889
Stuff like politics from like social issues and like

4284
05:40:05,610 --> 05:40:07,770
You mentioned like human rights issues, right?

4285
05:40:10,180 --> 05:40:12,180
You can't like lump everything together

4286
05:40:13,880 --> 05:40:21,639
Because they're they're very different

4287
05:40:21,639 --> 05:40:25,240
And in the rules there are I have rules here

4288
05:40:25,720 --> 05:40:27,959
At the bottom of the stream

4289
05:40:27,959 --> 05:40:29,959
It does very clearly say

4290
05:40:29,959 --> 05:40:32,759
Don't talk about politics. Don't talk about any

4291
05:40:33,880 --> 05:40:35,159
bigot shit

4292
05:40:35,159 --> 05:40:37,180
No racist shit

4293
05:40:37,180 --> 05:40:39,180
I really feel like I don't have to say that

4294
05:40:42,659 --> 05:40:46,099
Just like just relax a little we don't have to do that here

4295
05:40:53,939 --> 05:40:56,119
I can't

4296
05:40:56,119 --> 05:40:59,209
Tell you

4297
05:40:59,209 --> 05:41:00,729
What to think?

4298
05:41:00,729 --> 05:41:04,009
I can't tell you what to believe. I can't tell you how to live your life

4299
05:41:05,430 --> 05:41:06,229
But

4300
05:41:06,229 --> 05:41:09,349
All I can tell you is at least try to respect the people around you

4301
05:41:09,990 --> 05:41:13,259
To a point where everybody that everybody deserves

4302
05:41:14,139 --> 05:41:16,139
Just for being a person in the first place

4303
05:41:22,860 --> 05:41:24,860
That's not the intention of these streams

4304
05:41:39,849 --> 05:41:43,689
I'm not a person of multi-billion dollar corporation. Jeremiah 985

4305
05:41:45,209 --> 05:41:56,220
Are we allowed to hate you?

4306
05:41:59,669 --> 05:42:02,389
Like I said, I can't change somebody's mind. I can't tell you

4307
05:42:03,189 --> 05:42:05,319
to like not

4308
05:42:05,319 --> 05:42:07,799
Be a certain way. I can want that to be the case

4309
05:42:08,520 --> 05:42:17,299
But we all gotta we all gotta exist here

4310
05:42:19,060 --> 05:42:19,939
just

4311
05:42:19,939 --> 05:42:22,979
Respect your peers here. There's no reason for it

4312
05:42:23,540 --> 05:42:30,310
That's not what we're doing here

4313
05:42:30,310 --> 05:42:31,270
anyways

4314
05:42:31,270 --> 05:42:33,580
I feel like i've made a pretty

4315
05:42:36,220 --> 05:42:40,299
Big statement here about I don't really talk. I don't really talk about this kind of stuff

4316
05:42:41,099 --> 05:42:43,099
ever really I mean ever

4317
05:42:44,310 --> 05:42:49,299
And there's a reason for it. I hopefully I could at least make that point somewhat clear

4318
05:42:59,099 --> 05:43:00,659
but

4319
05:43:00,659 --> 05:43:07,459
Regardless of any of this

4320
05:43:07,459 --> 05:43:16,759
Thank you with five dollars appreciate it. You underestimate how addicted he is to gambling

4321
05:43:22,619 --> 05:43:24,619
I'm not that addicted to gambling

4322
05:43:26,009 --> 05:43:41,380
It's fun. Sometimes in a fake video game. He moved to vegas

4323
05:43:42,549 --> 05:43:45,509
Yeah, but that there are casinos here. Guess what there are casinos in

4324
05:43:46,630 --> 05:43:48,630
In the new in new england, too

4325
05:43:49,509 --> 05:43:57,340
They just opened up one boston or yeah boston just brought in one of the biggest casinos

4326
05:43:58,729 --> 05:44:03,770
In new england, I couldn't have gambled there

4327
05:44:08,310 --> 05:44:09,669
You would know

4328
05:44:09,669 --> 05:44:12,709
Yeah, I would know because it was one of the biggest construction and

4329
05:44:13,669 --> 05:44:15,669
projects the state had ever seen

4330
05:44:15,990 --> 05:44:17,990
Wait, what do I live under a rock?

4331
05:44:19,990 --> 05:44:21,990
That was happening before I moved

4332
05:44:28,819 --> 05:44:40,779
Prove you're not addicted and don't play any gambling games for a year

4333
05:44:44,889 --> 05:44:46,970
Playing terraria is a gambling game

4334
05:44:47,779 --> 05:44:50,180
You kill monsters and hope they drop the thing that you want

4335
05:44:52,009 --> 05:44:54,250
Should I never play a loot based game ever again?

4336
05:44:57,540 --> 05:44:59,540
That's that's kind of gamble

4337
05:44:59,860 --> 05:45:02,259
You kill the same boss like 20 times to see if

4338
05:45:03,720 --> 05:45:07,080
You open the hearthstone packs to try to get the stuff in there to get the

4339
05:45:09,700 --> 05:45:11,700
This is the logic that ea used

4340
05:45:27,750 --> 05:45:36,389
Ea used the oh, yeah what he didn't use that logic. I'm good. I got it. It is loot box politics

4341
05:45:52,139 --> 05:45:54,139
It sadly is to an extent

4342
05:45:59,610 --> 05:46:01,880
tf2 is gambling

4343
05:46:01,880 --> 05:46:03,880
Hey easy now

4344
05:46:03,880 --> 05:46:08,580
Easy now

4345
05:46:08,580 --> 05:46:10,580
All right only a couple more we got

4346
05:46:10,580 --> 05:46:12,580
Nick just came in with 50 dollars

4347
05:46:14,970 --> 05:46:19,369
A few minutes ago. We were in the middle of talking about some things, but thank you nick for the

4348
05:46:20,549 --> 05:46:23,799
5,000 bits 50 bucks

4349
05:46:23,799 --> 05:46:25,799
That's a huge amount of money right at the very end

4350
05:46:26,759 --> 05:46:30,919
They said i'm quitting twitch. Just wanted to thank you from one of my favorite streamers of all time

4351
05:46:33,770 --> 05:46:35,529
Thank you for the 50 dollars

4352
05:46:35,529 --> 05:46:39,220
nick hopefully um

4353
05:46:39,220 --> 05:46:44,860
Quitting twitch the thing is

4354
05:46:46,549 --> 05:46:48,549
Let's say that if you know that that's for real

4355
05:46:49,270 --> 05:46:51,860
And sometimes you kind of have to unplug a little you know

4356
05:46:55,610 --> 05:46:57,669
Social media is great

4357
05:46:57,669 --> 05:46:59,270
Streaming stuff is great

4358
05:46:59,270 --> 05:47:04,490
I mean sometimes you gotta do something else, you know pull your brain out a little

4359
05:47:12,520 --> 05:47:15,479
I barely even I barely participate in social media

4360
05:47:17,110 --> 05:47:19,110
Look at my twitter. Look at my facebook

4361
05:47:22,650 --> 05:47:25,209
But regardless of your reasons nick. Thank you so much

4362
05:47:26,090 --> 05:47:28,439
um

4363
05:47:28,439 --> 05:47:31,319
Thank you with the 50 dollars

4364
05:47:31,319 --> 05:47:36,200
And uh, maybe uh, we'll see you again another time if not, then good luck with whatever uh, whatever you do

4365
05:47:40,340 --> 05:47:42,180
uh back in

4366
05:47:42,180 --> 05:47:44,840
Gave two dollars and fifty cents

4367
05:47:44,840 --> 05:47:49,319
I already posted this before on discord and on chat, but I made a germ a tier list tier list

4368
05:47:50,840 --> 05:47:53,590
Oh my god that you could do

4369
05:47:54,229 --> 05:47:56,340
Or not

4370
05:47:56,340 --> 05:47:58,340
Maybe at the very end. I would do one of these

4371
05:47:58,979 --> 05:48:00,860
Why would I?

4372
05:48:00,860 --> 05:48:02,860
Why would I do one of these?

4373
05:48:05,189 --> 05:48:07,189
Thank you for the 250 though

4374
05:48:07,430 --> 05:48:11,580
For audience thanks to the 250. I would uh not be against terraria saturdays

4375
05:48:21,020 --> 05:48:28,419
Neither would I

4376
05:48:28,419 --> 05:48:31,990
That's why i'm doing it

4377
05:48:31,990 --> 05:48:36,069
Yeah, just keep adding them. I'm gonna do like at least another four or five of those over the next like

You should host critical. Uh, it's critical streaming right now. What's it doing? Why?

4383
05:49:52,779 --> 05:49:54,779
