1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,820
What's up? Good afternoon, how are you? We're a little early today, yeah. There's a reason for

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:17,980
that though. We are early because I wanted to pull the stream back to be able to do two different

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,859
things today. Originally it was going to be like a three hour stream in Jackbox, but I've decided

4
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:35,530
and well I was asked to play Trine. So there's going to be, starting now, there's going to be like

5
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:44,979
a couple hours, maybe two, three hours of Trine with Star and Ashley. And then Star and Ashley

6
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:52,969
are also going to join us for Jackbox. So I'll, this will be, this will not be a three hour stream.

7
00:00:53,530 --> 00:01:03,899
Pulling it back lets us do both. But I do have to hard stop this stream between like 5 30 and

8
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,260
6 o'clock pacific, 6 30, maybe the latest. Because I have to, I have to leave. I have to get on an

9
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:31,079
airplane. I've got to go. This is the week. I have to prepare and I got to go. For what? Well,

10
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:39,000
it's funny that you asked. Nobody. I didn't even see it. The Halloween stream requires a lot more

11
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:50,459
setup and time. So I'm going into the studio and I'm going back east. Nobody asked.

12
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:56,250
The one paid actor did. Yeah, going back to the east coast. I'm going to visit some family and

13
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:05,209
friends while I'm there. Gives me an opportunity to be in Boston for a while and hang out. I'm

14
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:08,090
not going to stream to the Halloween stream. After today, there's not going to be a stream

15
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,300
until Halloween. Just to let you guys know, the Halloween stream is the next stream after this one.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,330
Back, back to Boston. Here we go. But yeah, that's the plan and I believe we're kind of just ready

17
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:39,560
to go. Let's just see if we are. Hello. How is everybody doing? Hello. Hello. Not bad. Not

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:52,810
pretty good. All right. That's star and that's Ashley. They are star and Ashley. Power and

19
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,490
wisdom and what was the other one? Oh my God. Courage. Courage. I didn't know it. She never

20
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,129
told me. How am I supposed to know if my wife doesn't tell me? Unbelievable. Where do we leave

21
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,050
off? What did we do last time? I don't remember. Okay. So last time where we left off in the

22
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,169
three trainers, we definitely paid attention to the entirety of the plot. I think the nightmare

23
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:22,250
prince ran away from us because he didn't want to be locked in the castle and now we're chasing him.

24
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,930
Oh, that's right. We are chasing somebody. Yeah. The nightmare prince who's having these dreams

25
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,169
and his dreams are coming to life. And the only thing he dreams about are a wolf.

26
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:40,229
Does he really deserve our help? I know he is a prince. Well, I think our characters were

27
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:45,270
touching on that a little bit, like that we were wasting our time and that he was a snotty little

28
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,990
brat. And why do you guys care about honestly, I have the power to create boxes. You think I'm

29
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,229
going to waste my time on this kid? Dude, we already said it before. Last time we did the

30
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:04,469
three trainers for lore mega lol. You're the one that asked. Oh, did I? I mean, you said,

31
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:09,669
where did we leave off? I explained it. I did not just ask what, what? No, I said, well, like in,

32
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,629
like in the video game, like where did we leave off? Right here. Yeah. But then you started going

33
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,350
off on like the story and I started to get fucking tired. Where else, like where, what else would you

34
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:28,470
be asking? I don't know. Like what was the last puzzle we did? Who cares? You don't care about

35
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,550
the lore, but you care about the last puzzle we did. I don't know. What's the context? Remember

36
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:40,069
the wizard hall, like full of mirrors? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. You started talking about like

37
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:46,889
story and I started to get fucking tired. Oh, we got a wall here. Oh, right. Fighting.

38
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,129
There is fighting in this game. There's the wolf you're screaming about.

39
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:58,629
He also dreams of platforms a lot. Wolves. Why wolves though? Can somebody explain it to me?

40
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,470
My chat's saying that he's a furry. Probably right. Boston accent. There's a deer in the

41
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,589
background. You guys just ran by. Wait, are you skipping all the, we need these, don't we?

42
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,259
Yeah, rowdy. I got one.

43
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,889
Oh yeah. And then, then I was doing all the dialogue from my character and it was a lot of fun.

44
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,329
We had a really good time with that joke. This is a new mechanic and you talked over the whole thing.

45
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:45,779
Oh, it is a new mechanic. There's things. I can freeze that. Oh, oh, thank you. And then

46
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,579
I think you might have to, all right, put the box over there so she can get the, uh,

47
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:00,300
the droplet. She already has blood. Yeah, Jeremy's blood. Not what we leave. Okay. Uh,

48
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,060
one of us is locked out. His blood. Uh, shit. He just shoved it right in the perfect spot. Oh,

49
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,100
thank you. All right. I've got that and I'm going to cut you guys loose and you can go on the ride.

50
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,860
You ready? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Nice. Was that fun?

51
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:26,009
I sacrificed myself. You're missing the blood. Yeah, but I can't get that. You can get that.

52
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:33,879
I can't get that. Can I get that here? Stop Ashley. Stop hitting my box. I'm going to push

53
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:40,120
this. German watches the German watches the departed in Boston Red Sox baseball every day.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,720
Um, you say that as a, you say that as a joke, but, uh, that's, I think that is like required

55
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,800
reading. If you live in Boston, like at least once every couple of years, that like is what

56
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,360
happens. I didn't, Oh, I didn't even freeze that. I was talking. We were having fun. Just jump up

57
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,490
here. Let's just get going. Yeah. Just get the blood. Hold on. The departed is amazing. Yeah.

58
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,970
Okay. Two boards. You didn't say it right though. You didn't put an A H in your,

59
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,839
in your word. It's the fucking deposit. And if you don't say the F word in the middle either,

60
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:24,199
you're dead. I know it's a true, I know who's a true Boston fan. If you don't say the fucking

61
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,699
deposit. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why was I trying to freeze that rock? Wait, wait,

62
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,540
wait, wait, wait. Take, you gotta take, you gotta take the boulder to the left to activate the

63
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,800
lotus signal. Should I freeze that? What about what's up there? But what's up there? I can do

64
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:50,329
this. See, I told you, I knew I was supposed to go up there. All right. So now how do you get over

65
00:07:50,329 --> 00:08:04,540
there? Come with me. That works. Well, now when you need to block that. Oh, the fuck. Wait. Oh,

66
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,019
cause the boulder has to be over. Yeah. With your power, right? You do it and then you dash back.

67
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:16,279
Okay. I think I see these lamps are the fire. So if I light them, I just open the door. All right.

68
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:22,120
Nice. Yeah. Wow. All right. Fucking pot it. Nice. Oh yeah. That's where we left off. My character

69
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,399
can't do anything and I just make boxes and do everything. You got to remember that last time

70
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:37,639
we went over this. No, uh, we need to all get a boulder. I can do this. They're part of joke.

71
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:48,870
Plus two. How many elements did you hit? Oh, you got fucking destroyed. All right. I don't care.

72
00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:03,190
I'm fine. My true strength is respawning. So I think we can, can we just all get up there?

73
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,769
If we jump from here to there. Uh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff. How do you get up there? You got

74
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:11,289
to go this way. When I got my upgrade points, I can't use

75
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:27,480
daddy. Help me. I can't. I don't know. Left, left, left. Well, that works. Left. I think that,

76
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,279
yep. Oh, there's a bunch of shit up here, isn't there? And there's a bunch of stuff up here.

77
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,190
Hold on. Maybe my box can solve this. If that, if that happened, that's seriously what happened to

78
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:51,029
you. She's just trying to kill it. Oh crap. Nope. Oh, okay. Well, we can do this without Ashley

79
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:57,830
stars. My real name is Danny. Mine. Yeah. Your real name is Danny. Oh, there's nothing there.

80
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:07,080
Right. Anyway, my real name is Jason Long, American dragon. Whoa, dude. Super boost.

81
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:27,669
My name is Ollie shot color. You blocked it. Was that a fortnight bus horn? I don't know. I've

82
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:35,210
never played it. Never. Not even the previous version. Um, does the PlayStation four version

83
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,929
count if I'm lying down on my side in bed, bringing a monitor into my bedroom to play

84
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,049
that game on the PS four, the regular original game for like 20 minutes.

85
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,759
Does that count? How about you? You hold your shield up for someone to jump on. How about you

86
00:10:48,759 --> 00:11:01,379
do that? Well, you eat my ass. Well, I can freeze that. No, I'm just grandma. Just jump on it on the

87
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,620
jump on it. Please jump on me. Please. This is like the easiest. Oh, wait, I have to move.

88
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:16,899
You have to do it. Why is everybody yelling at me? Oh, no, no, pull it up. I can pull it up.

89
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:30,139
Pull it up. You have it there. Oh, my God. It's so easy. Okay. Get

90
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:38,649
it. Why is it activating? Wait, no, no, no, that that's how you do it. I'm not supposed to

91
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:43,450
be up here. Me being up here, fucks this whole thing up. Why did you tell me to go over here?

92
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:55,379
Put that back up there. Watch this. Okay, we did it. See, I just have to hang it. That was so easy.

93
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,700
God, then you're the leader. Glad you have a wizard. You think you're the leader.

94
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Why can't we be friends and have fun? There is no leader. I have the biggest hat. We have a 33%

95
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:24,009
stake in this at all the same. Oh, my God. But I actually get 38% for hosting fees. And because of

96
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,250
the fire, I need my expenses for the fire. In fact, I probably like 42% because these are expensive.

97
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:44,679
Okay. 44% I think would be covered. All right, now what do I do? You gloat from up there.

98
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:54,679
I'll just take all of it. And then like, I'll give you guys like a little bit to like,

99
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:13,769
wait, I want all your shot. What is it doing? Why is it doing that?

100
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:23,940
Behold my power. I can now make balls. Do it. Wait, what can you do?

101
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,879
How do I do it? I made them bouncy too. It's a ball.

102
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,639
Wait, it said I unlocked bouncy balls. Wow. You just shaved off the corners of your boxes.

103
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:46,580
Great. Wow. That's what a power. You're just saving money.

104
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,980
Wait, I also learned I learned to blink, but it didn't tell me how to do it.

105
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:07,320
What a shift for me. Oh my god, I'm useful. I guess I have to spend these points.

106
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,460
Hey, he's using for an alt. So we don't all do the same alt. What do you mean? Because you get more

107
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,080
points than you can spend for your one character. So what are you guys using for an alt? There's we

108
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:31,080
don't have alt. I'm not doing that. You are the archer. Shut up and live with it. But okay,

109
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,480
can you get those blood? I'm just wait, you, you, you generate more experience points than you can

110
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:46,009
spend. What are you doing? I can do the worms. I'm supposed to bash this. Why would it? Oh, oh,

111
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:52,139
I think that wasn't a joke. There it is. I'm serious. I don't, I want to like, what if we need

112
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:59,419
to? I don't know. No, being serious. We can't switch characters. This is a, oh, well then this

113
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:05,480
is classic. Why does it give you extra points? Because you can play this single player and switch

114
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,919
for all three characters. I see. Okay. Well, we have to roll on your ball. Oh my god.

115
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:22,070
And I remain. Actually, just die. If we both die, we'll appear at him. Okay.

116
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:31,460
That's not working. You go forward. Go forward. You got, it's not working. I've been standing over

117
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,899
here this whole time. Come on. Keep going. What do you mean? I can't keep going. I need you.

118
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:46,460
I can't get this. See, I can't reach this.

119
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,580
Almost worked. Obviously now he appears over here. See. Maybe it has to be two people have to be

120
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,370
there. Possibly. These puzzles are going to get crazy once all our powers reach their maximum

121
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,649
potential and we're required. This looks too complicated. Let's just do Jackbox.

122
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,009
Now you have that in your back pocket. It's gonna be really annoying.

123
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:18,250
What? Playing Jackbox? Oh, I said it once. That's the first time I said it.

124
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,730
Well, you were thinking at the full plug. Hold on. It's hard to aim this

125
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:32,279
because it snaps. Okay. Now you should be able to get up there and then do the,

126
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:41,129
yeah. Sick. Now drop a ladder. Drop a ladder. Now you, here we go.

127
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,220
You mean go on without you guys? Okay. Oh, so Daisy. Okay. Now I do that. Oh, shoot.

128
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:58,600
Wait, what? What's up there? Fireballs. Mega. Oh, what's up on the left? I don't know. What's

129
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,480
up this way? Oh, shit. What's up this way? I don't know. Let's find out. Oh, this place is full of

130
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:12,339
blood. I supposed to be here. Oh, you can't go up. It's a, you can, you can. I mean you can,

131
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:19,380
but I hit them. What did I hit? I got to hold my ball. Is that it? Yeah. Ashley didn't even

132
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,819
want to come up this way. Can we go apart? See if we can go apart. Oh, shit. Okay.

133
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:34,089
It's like the way to go. Where do you guys go? We're doing the secret bonus area.

134
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:43,000
The super difficult puzzle. It's not that difficult. It's extremely hard. It requires

135
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,480
three people. Oh, come on. We also got a talisman. You lied. Yeah, it was really hard.

136
00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:03,880
The two triners. Hey. Just momentarily, momentarily the two triners. She's trying to kill us.

137
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:28,700
Can you make it through? Almost died. You have a way to do that. Okay. Bring it down here. No,

138
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:43,289
what are you doing? Almost. I'm keen to your bullshit now. That was a hard one. There's a big

139
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,490
one. There is a big one. We're going to go up top left. So when you said, when you were making the

140
00:18:48,569 --> 00:19:01,349
joke that this is a hard one, it is you have to do this. Give me a box. Get a ball. Well,

141
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,910
I can't grab the edge of that. Okay. Well, that's my problem. You're going to make fun of how I

142
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:17,480
just shaved the edges off. I mean, that was pretty funny. All right. Now give me another one. All

143
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:30,950
right. Now. Oh, look at that. Oh, you got it. No. Come up here. Do you need me to drop this?

144
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:39,259
Are we good? We're good. We're good. Okay. We are the three triners. Oh, my God.

145
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,329
Incoming boss fight probably.

146
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:55,349
Wait, why are you guys so far off the screen? Because we kept going forward. I thought it was

147
00:19:55,349 --> 00:20:09,670
a cut scene. And then you have to roll down there. Oh, now. Okay. Hold on. Now it presses the button

148
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:19,349
to get the stuff. Okay. What about here? Drop a drop a ball down the little area.

149
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:29,740
It's going to open this door. Cool. Dude, we're so smart. Somebody said, is this paper Mario?

150
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:46,200
Yeah. You know, I've never played paper Mario. Same. Have you? Have you never played either? No,

151
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,980
I'm not a Nintendo boy. I played it. Maybe. Oh, I'm just going to make. Can I make a

152
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:08,440
bridge to the ball? Probably. Why was it not rolling? I was walking. Oh, only one person

153
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:20,660
can roll it. Okay. Oh, play it right now. Hey, what? Play it right now. No, I'm not going to play

154
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:27,640
paper Mario right now. Okay. I've got a bridge. If you like Mario RPG, you should love paper Mario.

155
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:38,490
It's not that I don't like it. It's just not the same. Oh, nothing's the same. I know. I know.

156
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,769
Why do we just break all the boxes? Maybe you might think to yourself we could use that box.

157
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:52,009
Somebody just said it's better. You have infinite boxes in your butthole. But I can only have one

158
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,650
box. That was access to multiple boxes. There's a box slot. Look how high we have to climb. What if

159
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,529
we had a box right now? There's a box slot right there. No, not a ball slot, a box slot.

160
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,490
The less boxes we have, the more useful you are. Think about that.

161
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:14,759
What? Well, I'd still be the one moving the box. Yeah. Even if we have more boxes.

162
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:20,200
But I like your boxes better. It's a compliment. He hates trying to break these boxes.

163
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,000
The wizard like they're my friends. Like, please. It's not with the box breaking. I studied box

164
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,299
magic. No more. Don't kill any more boxes, please. They're so nice to be. Boxes don't get enough

165
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,380
respect around you. As an awful old man, boys, you can do better than that. I know you can.

166
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:47,819
Okay. That was even worse. Quite a treasure there. You have a natural cube.

167
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:58,039
Let me step in here for you. These boxes are so hard to control. If only I had my scrolls.

168
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:09,799
That's an old man's motto. Fuck my stomach. I can't laugh. I'm not supposed to be laughing.

169
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,160
I think it needs to be you, Jermis. You roll on the ball. The ball is currently...

170
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:27,960
I'll take care of it. Let me step in for you. No, no. No. Yes. There you go.

171
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:38,150
And you get a bridge. This looks so stupid. Why would I need a fucking ball? Get that

172
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,680
fucking ball out of here. Oh, my. I'm so... Hold on. I gotta calm down.

173
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,480
You have quite a treasure there in that Herodric ball.

174
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,680
I got so fucking angry right there. Why? Oh, my God. What's wrong?

175
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:53,319
Fucking God. Hold on. All right. Jeez. Slow down.

176
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,400
You did it. Hey, look at all these boxes.

177
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,039
Oh, I'm trying to... Get out of here.

178
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,369
You can do it. No, I'm not trying to jump on that. I'm trying to grab the thing.

179
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:19,740
Jermis, this is psycho. Oh, there's a secret tunnel down here.

180
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,579
What? Are you kidding me? Let me see. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're going to have to

181
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:35,420
freeze these when my box or ball is in front of it, okay?

182
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:44,470
Stop making me laugh. All right. I'll get into this next time.

183
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:56,599
I was going to say if that didn't hit it, nothing will ever hit it. All right. Then you have to go.

184
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:09,779
Oh, fuck. Okay. I did it. Oops-a-daisy. No, I didn't. Oops-a-daisy. Oops-a-daisy.

185
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:13,779
It was the wrong... Okay, hold on. I was just... Don't let go. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

186
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:21,349
I'm trying to cut it. All right. Now watch this. I don't need... There.

187
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:32,089
Come on. Fuck you. We didn't need you for this puzzle.

188
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:43,900
We got it. Oh, points. I still can't. So, was it just a secret area? Yeah. Oh, pressure.

189
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:51,779
Yep. Can't go over there. Yeah. Trying to get out of here without the ball.

190
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:03,829
We're already both out. I meant like this way. Oh. Did it. Oh, did it too. Okay. Okay.

191
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:09,349
You made that sound like it was going to be way harder. Give it to me. Wait. There's another

192
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:19,019
thing to break. Oh, my God. It's running. It's running away. Get him back. All right. Now you

193
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:27,079
got to actually pay attention. We got enemies. Bro's a big guy. How did I die? Wrong thing.

194
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay. This is all you. Wait, me? Yeah. We, we died. Oh, my God.

195
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:51,240
Well, they did it. This game is way too easy. Um,

196
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,839
um, there's been a few challenging things so far. Yeah. What's the point of the game

197
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,279
if I can't brag about it on like Reddit after I beat it? Yeah. I only play games with like

198
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:13,450
2% completion rates. Oh, am I sticking the slot in the cube? Oh, the most powerful ball.

199
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:25,900
The moon. Okay. Oh, fights are meaningless. Yeah. It's like commentary on war.

200
00:27:27,099 --> 00:27:41,190
Stop. Stop. Stop it. No more funny things. I'm supposed to be the funny one. You stop

201
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:48,940
making jokes. No, I like, I have like fucking side pain. Why do you guys think I played

202
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,460
Bushido blade last night? Cause there's no way it was going to be funny. And it was hilarious.

203
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,380
Yeah. He's on this whole new thing where he just wants to like not have fun anymore. All right.

204
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:08,170
Give it to that box. It's too much. It's too heavy. It's too heavy. All right. Now you got to

205
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,579
go on this one. You wait. I'm the lightest. Wait, I'm the lightest. Wait,

206
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:17,259
Triner telling you one more funny thing out of you and I'm out of this call.

207
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,130
See? All right. Now I can freeze it. That's good. No, it's good. Or whatever.

208
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,140
There's a hook over here. What is it? What's that hook for? What did, what just happened?

209
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:37,619
I think you just, did you cut my line? I did. I was pointing with my sword.

210
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:48,569
I pointed too hard. Yeah, almost. I think that's the cheater's hook. So you just skip the whole

211
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:59,579
thing. Kind of is, but cheaters or what? Uh, there's a little thing I can pull.

212
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:15,480
Pull it. What is this for? I don't understand the application here. Oh, to get us over.

213
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:24,970
Just to make it easy. Well, we can all get over. Oh, come on, dude. Nope. I'm your wife.

214
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:32,859
I'm your wife. Uh, statistically most murders happen with people that know each other.

215
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,779
Most husbands murder wives. Yeah. I'm saying like that's okay. You have to freeze this left one.

216
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:47,960
What I'm saying is they're going to catch it. What happened? You got to catch me first. All

217
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,119
right. So this, this is done. And then you got to put that up there. And then we put this one up

218
00:29:52,119 --> 00:30:05,779
here that allows us to go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up 99% of husbands.

219
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:25,400
I just die. Yeah. How, what? Oh, you might have to freeze this one too. Jeremy. Okay.

345
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:52,019
learning experience whoa okay in a real deep in this tree now yeah I don't think

there a thing to drop down hmm something down here but what oh I think you could

349
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,849
probably just grapple up to the wall I don't know that's just no other reason

350
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:24,920
to be here oh there is okay there is a reason to be down here there's a secret

351
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,469
room but can I do this on my own I don't think I can

352
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:38,019

365
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:48,949
no oh whoo okay come on rowdy I can use all these skill points all right I have

366
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:56,059
two locks here I have a frozen lock and I have a fire lock that doesn't mean

367
00:53:56,059 --> 00:54:03,639
anything holy shit that was actually kind of scary there's another wall over

368
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:09,320
here need a ball need to launch that one up here somehow how do we open this

369
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:20,260
door though behind this wall there's an ice key to the left I think you might

370
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:25,940
need to make a rope bridge for me to put a ball on either that or this ball will

371
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:31,460
knock another ball forward I mean that's I don't think I can place balls on ropes

372
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:44,469
oh I can you can so I guess that is what you do so then now how do we push the

373
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:52,469
key like oh how do you oh you can pick them up

374
00:54:52,469 --> 00:55:09,019
they're can't put down sword see hello well you don't try it and you try and do

375
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:19,400
it I mean you try and do it beg me there's no begging someone say

376
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:26,289
something nice about me put that key in that slot or you're gonna have an

377
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:31,170
incredibly angry fucking person here put it in your slot okay this joke is done

378
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:57,159
no one like even one threatened I'm a fucking you know how you do that give

379
00:55:57,159 --> 00:56:06,420
you money okay now so freeze it when it gets that's weigh it down freeze it we

380
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,099
need to break the ceiling so I think you need to make another rope that angles up

381
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:17,500
to launch a ball up I can't attach it to anything though unless you put like a

382
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:28,690
ball over here I can attach to like a to that it's pretty janky but it'll

383
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:40,550
probably work will it work just keep just keep doing it will happen it's I

384
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:52,710
think yeah no okay that what I did not make another ball we just we yeah yeah

385
00:56:52,710 --> 00:57:02,780
we might need to swing the ball around the left one yeah we need to attach

386
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:13,449
that to the ball yeah so now you swing it like a pendulum yeah dude the three

387
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:25,039
Triners knew that that was testing everyone else oh okay all right bring

388
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,760
this night wait it's done can I just make a box every once in a

389
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:36,719
while demolish we did it the right way the way the gamer game makers intended

390
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:45,849
nice what what's happened you got hurt on these hold on let me freeze this get

391

393
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,260
analog but I mean that went through it did everybody knows that's what happened

394

01:12:47,699 --> 01:13:07,850
thinking about it in like ten years for somebody just wrote and I'm gonna make a

491
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,729
reference to this so you know like they said like five to ten years ago don't

492
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:15,329
don't put dumb shit on Facebook don't put it because like what if you go to a

493
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:18,449
job interview and they see it right that was like the thing they told us like ten

494
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:25,609
years ago in twitch chat now somebody just wrote I can't stop farting your

495
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:30,090

496
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:44,739
careful yeah he will no one wants a gasser what do you mean how there's

497
01:13:44,739 --> 01:14:05,420
times that I can't stop party no matter what and Ashley got hired they're gonna

498
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:17,649
know when you was scratching your ass last all right you're gonna pull that up

499
01:14:17,649 --> 01:14:23,800
and like linked up I did see a story really recently about a guy that like

500
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,359
had done this really amazing charity thing like raised like $200,000 like got

501
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:32,720
his name on a beer can for this charity and then they felt like two tweets from

502
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:40,600
eight years ago like everyone took their money back what a good thing we raised

503
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:49,340
money for but then like put his face on like a beer can or something and the

504
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:55,949
beer guy didn't want that that tweet guy so watch those farts guys why don't talk

505
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:08,390
parts are fine yeah we gotta get the light I think I think okay wait wait

506
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:15,300
wait we shield right the boxes get off the box off over here and now I actually

507
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:26,470
stand on the boxes and dream shield it down down down yeah what would you do

508
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:31,659
without me chat won't moving so fast my boss won't see this germ is a furry in

509
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:34,460
In ten years your boss is gonna go, who the fuck is Jerma?

510
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,260
Is this somebody that you made up in your mind?

511
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:43,819
Is this supposed to be you? I see it. Also, you know, it's

512
01:15:44,619 --> 01:15:49,199
285 times over the course of six months. You wrote bald idiot

513
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,180
Who's that a reference to?

514
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:55,979
Who's the bald idiot? Who's this? I don't understand this. Who is that? What's that for?

515
01:15:55,979 --> 01:15:58,979
Well, after the copy was easy to find, just two more flowers to go.

516
01:15:58,979 --> 01:16:00,979
Oh, we're looking for flowers.

517
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,750
Okay.

518
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:10,250
Where's flowers?

519
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,550
And then he- and then he-

520
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:18,470
You look at his head, and it's like there's a fucking giant M receding hairline on his head.

521
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:22,590
I just- what's that? What's that? What's that? Is that funny? Is there something funny there?

522
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:27,869
You're gonna have to dream shield over to the box. I think.

523
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,460
The plant is in that wall on the right.

524
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:38,380
So you need to dream shield towards the box so you can second shield it into the wall.

525
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:41,460
I don't think I could use the dream shield thing when I'm moving though.

526
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:44,579
My father was the baldest man on earth, and he created this company.

527
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:49,739
Think I'm gonna let that fly?

528
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,939
Yeah, I'm like hitting F. Nothing's happening.

529
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:58,979
Can we make a box like right here so I don't bounce or no?

530
01:16:59,539 --> 01:17:02,220
Just keep doing that. I mean, it's hitting the plant. Is it hitting it?

531
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:11,529
This is stupid. I feel embarrassed. Look how dumb I look. I'm a fucking warrior. This is cool.

532
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:18,420
I feel like I should be able to grab a- no, wait, but I can grab and make a-

533
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:22,140
You can, yeah, you can make a rope across. This is what they want.

534
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:27,100
Yeah, but I can't move it when it's roped and people are jumping on it and it's flying into the sky.

535
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:31,539
So you're talking about like bang bang.

536
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:33,979
There we go.

537
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:35,979
Is it not good enough? There it is.

538
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:53,369
Hey future boss, I want to go to Chili's at 3 today.

539
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:58,170
Well, what if- what if you turn out to be- like people dig up things you said from Chili's-

540
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,170
Eww, eww, Chili's is disgusting.

541
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:07,609
And you are determined to be a bad person, so in the future when your boss sees that in the past the current employee called you bald,

542
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:10,770
they're happy that they made fun of you because in the future you're bad.

543
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,529
Yeah, what if you go to jail forever for like murder?

544
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:18,569
There was a Bruce Willis movie about this already. Next.

545
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:25,609
About people getting promoted for making fun of Bruce Willis?

546
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:44,810
No, maybe. I need to- come on. I need to move- I need to move this to here.

547
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:52,970
Thought I had to. And then that means we can go like this and then we can box it up.

548
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:54,970
I think this is fine.

549
01:18:54,970 --> 01:19:12,699
Oof. Whoa, don't even need it. Wait. Oof.

550
01:19:12,699 --> 01:19:15,619
Wait a minute.

551
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,619
That's cool.

552
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:21,270
I want to be able to make the plank.

553
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:24,189
Oh, come on.

554
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:26,189
You did forget a spell in your old age.

555
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:28,189
Ooh, I do have- do I have one?

556
01:19:28,189 --> 01:19:30,619
What the hell?

557
01:19:30,619 --> 01:19:34,060
Why does the archer get less shit than everybody else?

558
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,060
Hey! Hey, archer!

559
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,060
Come be useful.

560
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:44,649
Hey, archer!

561
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:51,670
Archer!

562
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,670
Here's a hook below you.

563
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:55,670
That works too.

564
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:01,670
You can solve problems in like seven different ways and you're mad that you don't have enough things.

565
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:06,510
I'm molding.

566
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,510
Stop.

567
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,510
Molding. Because molding.

568
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:11,510
Stop. You're giving them strength.

569
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,510
I like that. Correct.

570
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:24,869
Break this.

571
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:26,869
Okay, we're gonna find out that these are the Nightmare Prince's parents.

572
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:29,430
What, these barrels?

573
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,430
No, the badger and the-

574
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,430
The hedgehog?

575
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,760
Yeah.

576
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:44,760
That would be stupid.

577
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:47,439
Okay, do you want to play the wizard?

578
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,439
You know how annoying it is to try and make boxes where people need them but they stand where they want them?

579
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:54,260
Bald.

580
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,260
He must be bald.

581
01:20:58,819 --> 01:21:01,310
You need me to move these?

582
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,550
Do you need another compliment?

583
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:05,550
Yeah.

584
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:09,899
I'll move it. I can do it.

585
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,899
You got a dream shield, the fucking light.

586
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:15,899
What light? Where is it?

587
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:18,460
On the right!

588
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,840
Box away.

589
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,840
Just do it straight forward.

590
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,840
What? What was that? Why did that happen?

591
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,229
That's pretty weird.

592
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:36,390
Don't stop. There you go.

593
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,390
I just made like dice.

594
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,390
On the dashboard.

595
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,850
You almost got it.

596
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:47,850
Come on.

597
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,850
No. Look, it worked.

598
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:51,850
The speedrun text.

599
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,850
Oh, look!

600
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,729
You got the prize.

601
01:21:57,409 --> 01:22:01,119
I've never been happy.

602
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:03,119
I wake up with tears already in my eyes.

603
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:08,029
What the fuck?

604
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,029
I have to watch the bedding every day.

605
01:22:10,029 --> 01:22:12,029
It keeps crying in it.

606
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:18,510
Okay, so let me...

607
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:20,510
Where's the water?

608
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:22,510
Oh, I don't need water. Double shield here.

609
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,510
And then you stand on my thing.

610
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:28,079
Daddy up.

611
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,319
Daddy!

612
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:32,319
Daddy upy!

613
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:38,850
Daddy look! Steve!

614
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:41,529
You can't do it that way, dude.

615
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:46,579
Here, can you stand on that?

616
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,960
I guess you need to bounce. You need to do double shield, don't you?

617
01:22:56,329 --> 01:23:01,770
This isn't working.

618
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,770
It would work.

619
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,010
Look, if you just hang a box

620
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,630
from the ceiling.

621
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:13,050
I think.

622
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:15,289
I gotta get like...

623
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:20,970
There you go.

624
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:23,270
Now can you get up here?

625
01:23:23,949 --> 01:23:26,699
Yeah, do that.

626
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:33,300
Yeah, I need something to jump on.

627
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,270
Every time I look over here

628
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,270
there's something else that I just see and I'm just like

629
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,270
I turn back.

630
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,699
My chat is upset

631
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:48,699
about double shield meta.

632
01:23:48,699 --> 01:23:50,699
What? Why?

633
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:54,609
Because we were like cheating it before.

634
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:56,609
No, it's a reference

635
01:23:56,609 --> 01:23:58,609
to a game in my room.

636
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:01,810
Oh.

637
01:24:02,489 --> 01:24:04,489
No, that is not connected.

638
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:06,489
It looks like it is, but it's not.

639
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:10,010
It's not connected.

640
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,380
I mean, you're enough to jump over it.

641
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,380
What did it say?

642
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:18,979
Do I even need to say it?

643
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:26,579
Alright, now I go like this.

644
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:38,619
Dude, you're so good. Thanks.

645
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:40,619
Dude, you're so good. Go!

646
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:48,359
You're so good.

647
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:50,729
Why doesn't someone build a road?

648
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:54,180
I know, really.

649
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,550
I think we need some boxes.

650
01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:02,760
I'm doing this to like pretend

651
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:05,439
I'm trying to play.

652
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,439
I'm trying to get, like, maybe if I hit it with my arrow

653
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:09,439
I'm secretly trying to hit it in the fucking head.

654
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:23,329
Oh, remember?

655
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:25,329
Last turn had like the fish level.

656
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,890
Didn't it?

657
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,890
There was a big ol' mean fishy.

658
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:31,890
Was there?

659
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,890
I don't think we ever completed the last one, did we?

660
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:35,890
I don't think we did.

661
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,890
I don't think so. We played it for like three and a half hours.

662
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:41,220
Tops.

663
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,220
Remember when that fisherman like carried Germa away

664
01:25:43,899 --> 01:25:45,899
Hey, there's a big nut up here. Hold on, big nut.

665
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:47,899
Big nut.

666
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,899
I'm waiting for you to get that shit out of here so I can pull this.

667
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:53,350
Nevermind.

668
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:59,109
I don't even need you to do that.

669
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:01,479
Big nut.

670
01:26:01,479 --> 01:26:08,520
Ooh, it's gonna fall.

671
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:19,399
That was a lot less dangerous than I thought it was gonna be.

672
01:26:19,399 --> 01:26:27,319
Light.

673
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:29,319
I don't know how you don't block that.

674
01:26:29,319 --> 01:26:31,319
What, if you stand on a box?

675
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:35,079
Like, can you...

676
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:37,079
But then the box will block it.

677
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:43,140
Uh, okay.

678
01:26:43,819 --> 01:26:45,819
Yeah, do that, and then stand, and then make a box like here.

679
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:50,539
Do it.

680
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,539
And then stand on the box and make it so it doesn't block the light.

681
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:56,539
If I can get it in a position where you can do it.

682
01:26:56,539 --> 01:26:58,539
What?

683
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:00,539
Like this.

684
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:03,170
There's no hooks or anything.

685
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:06,109
Oh. I thought it was secure.

686
01:27:06,109 --> 01:27:08,109
Good intentions.

687
01:27:08,109 --> 01:27:10,109
Hey, there it is. Almost.

688
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:12,109
Just move these forward.

689
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:14,670
I don't think so. No?

690
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:18,319
No.

691
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,539
I don't think...

692
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:25,539
Wait, hold on a second.

693
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:39,939
Can this be used for anything?

694
01:27:39,939 --> 01:27:41,939
If it bounces that way,

695
01:27:41,939 --> 01:27:43,939
you have to stand here somehow.

696
01:27:43,939 --> 01:27:46,380
I think I know.

697
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,380
I think I know, I think I know, I think I know.

698
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:50,380
Okay, hold on, hold on.

699
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,380
Brain is going maximum capacity.

700
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,380
You need to make a dream shield...

701
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:56,380
Okay, get off the box.

702
01:27:56,380 --> 01:27:58,380
You need to make a dream shield

703
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,789
while standing on top of this

704
01:28:02,789 --> 01:28:04,789
that's pointing at the flower.

705
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:07,470
Right now.

706
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,859
And now you need to get down

707
01:28:10,859 --> 01:28:12,859
and shoot it at the dream shield.

708
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:14,859
Reverse though.

709
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:16,859
Nice.

710
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:18,859
Awesome.

711
01:28:18,859 --> 01:28:21,739
That's cool.

712
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:24,430
Pretty cool.

713
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:34,670
I think if you stick something to that...

714
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:36,670
Oh, never mind.

715
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:38,670
I think I can just get this one now.

716
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,810
Oh, I didn't see the...

717
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:43,810
I didn't see it up there.

718
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:46,180
Oh, I can unfreeze with my butt.

719
01:28:46,859 --> 01:28:51,020
Oh, damn it.

720
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,319
Got it.

721
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:55,319
You know everything is solved with boxes.

722
01:28:55,319 --> 01:28:57,819
What just happened to me?

723
01:28:57,819 --> 01:29:08,619
Oh, sorry.

724
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:10,619
I did that on purpose because I wanted

725
01:29:10,619 --> 01:29:12,619
just to explode.

726
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:17,909
Why are you pushing that?

727
01:29:17,909 --> 01:29:19,909
Box on head or pre-recorded?

728
01:29:19,909 --> 01:29:24,069
Hurry up and do it.

729
01:29:24,069 --> 01:29:26,069
What's he doing with that big toothbrush?

730
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,069
This is too kind.

731
01:29:28,069 --> 01:29:33,319
I can never thank you enough.

732
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:35,319
If you are looking for the nightmare prince,

733
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I think he was headed towards the northern lakes.

734
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,560
We didn't have to help these people at all,

735
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,560
by the way.

736
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,560
The heroes took the hedgehog's advice

737
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,560
and followed a path leading to the west.

738
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,560
We could have been much faster if we just beat it out of them.

739
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:04,289
Alright.

740
01:30:04,289 --> 01:30:06,779
Swim level, wee.

741
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:08,779
Oh my god, it's swim level.

742
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,779
Dude, Ashley.

743
01:30:10,779 --> 01:30:12,779
This thing looks like you.

744
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,460
Where?

745
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,460
It's Otto.

746
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Fuck you, dude.

747
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:30,789
What are you getting, Cal?

748
01:30:30,789 --> 01:30:32,789
Oh.

749
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:37,720
I gotta make a signature.

750
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,880
Oh, yeah.

751
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,569
Break it. Snap it.

752
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:46,569
That's a big nut.

753
01:30:46,569 --> 01:30:56,090
Ooh.

754
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,090
Does it have to be an acorn?

755
01:30:58,090 --> 01:31:00,090
Use the fire arrow to activate

756
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:02,090
fire switches.

757
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:08,739
So it stays.

758
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,539
It's not like the freezing arrows.

759
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:17,550
Please make fire into the water.

760
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,550
Uh-oh.

761
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:23,699
Well, you gotta drain.

762
01:31:23,699 --> 01:31:26,899
Flash is filling it.

763
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,579
She wants you to have more water.

764
01:31:29,579 --> 01:31:36,050
Still can't upgrade anything.

765
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,930
Oh, Otto.

766
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:40,930
And it loves it.

767
01:31:40,930 --> 01:31:42,930
Oh, it loves it.

768
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:46,380
Oh, let's pound it.

769
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:49,760
Oh, that's traumatizing.

770
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,920
Best part of the game.

771
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,920
Whoa.

772
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,920
This thing's brand new.

773
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,619
Dumbass.

774
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:09,920
Hahaha.

775
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,539
What?

776
01:32:12,539 --> 01:32:16,449
What the fuck did you just say?

777
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:19,140
I said, got him.

778
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:26,300
Alright.

779
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:28,539
Fire has been activated.

780
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:30,539
Now we swim through this.

781
01:32:30,539 --> 01:32:33,810
So the stupid swim.

782
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:36,500
How do you do that?

783
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,859
Through the tunnel.

784
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:50,109
Got it.

785
01:32:50,789 --> 01:32:53,220
Oh, yeah.

786
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:55,220
He can do that.

787
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,220
I haven't had to do that move in like

788
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,220
six hours of gameplay.

789
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,220
So I forgot I could do that.

790
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:10,569
I remember.

791
01:33:10,569 --> 01:33:13,060
Oh, yeah, he can do that.

792
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:15,060
He can also roll if he has it done.

793
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,369
Just walk forward so you don't stuff

794
01:33:17,369 --> 01:33:19,989
on the plate.

795
01:33:19,989 --> 01:33:25,739
Almost.

796
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:27,739
Okay.

797
01:33:27,739 --> 01:33:29,739
Ball. On to help.

798
01:33:29,739 --> 01:33:39,319
Good.

799
01:33:48,560 --> 01:34:01,090
Fight.

800
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:15,020
Water into the wheel.

801
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,020
Water into the wheel.

802
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:41,359
There was a mermaid.

803
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:43,359
Oh, I wanna fuck.

804
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:50,529
Come fuck.

805
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:52,529
Alright, what's going on?

806
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:55,210
It's swimming away real fast.

807
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:57,210
Alright, fire over there.

808
01:34:57,210 --> 01:34:59,210
Ice block.

809
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:01,210
Can I switch

810
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:03,210
abilities?

811
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,210
Before I get screamed at?

812
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:08,729
You can make that shot.

813
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:10,729
It's kind of hard because I have to

814
01:35:10,729 --> 01:35:12,729
hold.

815
01:35:12,729 --> 01:35:14,729
I have to hold the right

816
01:35:14,729 --> 01:35:16,729
thumb thick.

817
01:35:18,729 --> 01:35:20,729
The right thumb stick.

818
01:35:20,729 --> 01:35:26,300
The right thumb tack.

819
01:35:26,979 --> 01:35:28,979
Just compound us.

820
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:30,979
Let me get the pine cone on here.

821
01:35:30,979 --> 01:35:32,979
Please.

822
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:34,979
He doesn't want to do it

823
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,979
the right way. He wants to do it the fast way.

824
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:40,880
I'm the person who

825
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,880
can lift these things and you keep fucking

826
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,880
jumping on it. I didn't do anything.

827
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,880
I'm pounding.

828
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,640
Now he wants to do two boxes.

829
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,640
I've seen this shtick

830
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,640
before. He wants two boxes over here for you to

831
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:01,439
jump on and skip the whole level.

832
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:07,390
I'm angry.

833
01:36:08,069 --> 01:36:10,069
I'm not even close

834
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:12,069
to his balls.

835
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:14,069
I'm still mad.

836
01:36:14,069 --> 01:36:16,699
Imagine how mad he is.

837
01:36:16,699 --> 01:36:18,699
I actually may have more hair than you.

838
01:36:18,699 --> 01:36:21,449
What?

839
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:23,449
Maybe.

840
01:36:23,449 --> 01:36:25,449
We're going on a hair off.

841
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:27,449
My hair is higher quality.

842
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:29,619
I think it's higher to the ceiling too.

843
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:35,619
True.

844
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:37,619
Let's go to a hair salon and determine who has higher

845
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:39,619
quality hair.

846
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,300
I've been told I've got some fucking high

847
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,300
quality hair.

848
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,930
By who? Your mom?

849
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,930
Yeah, my mother said that.

850
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:51,619
Can you help me here?

851
01:36:51,619 --> 01:36:53,619
Sounds like a mom compliment to me.

852
01:36:53,619 --> 01:36:55,619
Will you put like a block on this?

853
01:36:55,619 --> 01:37:00,020
Hey!

854
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,020
It's not my fault my blocks don't weigh enough

855
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:06,750
to satisfy you. Wait a minute.

856
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:12,380
Damn it.

857
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:14,380
If you're going to bring leg hair into this.

858
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:18,220
Hey, hello?

859
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,220
I don't know. Your legs are kind of scarred up

860
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:22,899
You have scars you don't grow hair.

861
01:37:22,899 --> 01:37:24,899
Yeah, but the rest of my leg makes up

862
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:26,899
like I could probably make three sets

863
01:37:26,899 --> 01:37:28,899
of Jerma's hair with a leg.

864
01:37:28,899 --> 01:37:30,899
That's because your legs are so much longer than this.

865
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:36,659
Okay.

866
01:37:36,659 --> 01:37:40,699
I mean, Jerma, honestly,

867
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:42,699
we were both able to do this.

868
01:37:42,699 --> 01:37:44,699
Yeah, because you're putting boxes down

869
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:46,699
and you're talking about leg hair.

870
01:37:46,699 --> 01:37:48,699
We get it. You got gross leg hair.

871
01:37:48,699 --> 01:37:50,699
I do.

872
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:57,930
More of it.

873
01:37:57,930 --> 01:38:00,619
Right in the car.

874
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,300
We got our puzzle.

875
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,300
Because everyone loves water levels.

876
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:08,109
You know what I'm saying?

877
01:38:08,109 --> 01:38:16,479
I'm working.

878
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,960
Pull it down. Stand on it.

879
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:28,189
Oops.

880
01:38:28,189 --> 01:38:32,670
I gotta freeze it.

881
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:38,500
Hold on.

882
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,500
Isn't that what we need?

883
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,500
Didn't we do it?

884
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,500
Yeah, now Jerma has to put the fire switch.

885
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,500
We did it.

886
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,500
Is it?

887
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,500
Shoot it.

888
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,180
Come on.

889
01:38:53,180 --> 01:39:08,199
We did it.

890
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:15,930
Let's just leave.

891
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:20,149
Wait, is that the mermaid?

892
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:22,149
No. Oh my god.

893
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:27,079
I'm trying to shoot it.

894
01:39:27,079 --> 01:39:30,260
You just crushed me.

895
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,699
Oh no, not Otto.

896
01:39:32,699 --> 01:39:35,500
Bring it down.

897
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,060
Save Otto.

898
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:40,060
I'll save my own damn dog.

899
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:49,399
How's Otto doing? What's new with him?

900
01:39:49,399 --> 01:39:51,399
What's in the news?

901
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:54,079
He's going to be a hot dog for Halloween.

902
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:56,079
Oh, that's a big surprise.

903
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,079
Yeah.

904
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:00,079
What the fuck?

905
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:02,079
This is somebody's arm.

906
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,020
It's a giant nightmare hand.

907
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,250
Okay, put it down here.

908
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:17,220
I need to jump on that to hit the flame.

909
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:19,220
Can you freeze the hand?

910
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,779
I tried it already.

911
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:23,779
I think we have to pull him forward and then I have to get up there.

912
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:28,539
Hmm.

913
01:40:28,539 --> 01:40:30,539
I can't jump.

914
01:40:30,539 --> 01:40:33,159
Put down another box so I can jump onto it.

915
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:35,159
What if I put the box here?

916
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,159
He breaks the box.

917
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:39,659
He's like, hey, fuck that box.

918
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:41,659
Oh, there we go.

919
01:40:41,659 --> 01:40:44,979
Oh, you can do it.

920
01:40:44,979 --> 01:40:46,979
Use the analog stick. Yeah.

921
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:48,979
Nice analog aiming.

922
01:40:48,979 --> 01:40:50,979
Oh no, Otto.

923
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:59,689
I can just hold him, I think.

924
01:40:59,689 --> 01:41:02,439
Then I have to...

925
01:41:02,439 --> 01:41:05,750
What do we do with the water?

926
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:08,930
Get it out of here.

927
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:12,189
Water.

928
01:41:12,189 --> 01:41:14,189
Oh my god, he's still holding onto him.

929
01:41:14,189 --> 01:41:17,699
Worry.

930
01:41:17,699 --> 01:41:24,800
Okay, that...

931
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,729
Hooray.

932
01:41:27,729 --> 01:41:29,729
Yeah, that was just helping with that bubble.

933
01:41:29,729 --> 01:41:35,039
You can now conjure a plank.

934
01:41:35,039 --> 01:41:42,380
New shape. Pretty cool.

935
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,380
So much more advanced than a cube.

936
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,060
Wow.

937
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,810
You could not have done that without me.

938
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:57,460
Well, but now you're going to be like slightly annoying giant plank guy.

939
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:00,439
Giant plank, all right.

940
01:42:00,439 --> 01:42:02,939
I know, it's already pretty annoying.

941
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:05,689
New letter.

942
01:42:05,689 --> 01:42:11,960
That character can't read.

943
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:19,300
Anything down here?

944
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:23,899
I don't think so.

945
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:25,899
Steve!

946
01:42:25,899 --> 01:42:28,329
What do you know?

947
01:42:28,329 --> 01:42:30,329
He's throwing pool covers at us. Great.

948
01:42:30,329 --> 01:42:32,329
He's declaring war is what he's doing.

949
01:42:32,329 --> 01:42:34,329
Okay, here.

950
01:42:34,329 --> 01:42:36,329
No, I gotta stand on this.

951
01:42:36,329 --> 01:42:42,199
All right, guys.

952
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,380
How can a plank help?

953
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:53,739
All right, keep it.

954
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:56,430
What are you doing?

955
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:00,270
I don't know.

956
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:02,270
Okay, now I need...

957
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:04,270
Just jump up. Jump up and I'll elevator you.

958
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:07,539
Go!

959
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:11,119
Excellent.

960
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:16,500
They're dogs.

961
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,500
Yeah, I need to...

962
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,930
I'm gonna do this.

963
01:43:20,930 --> 01:43:22,930
Nice.

964
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:25,550
Let's synchronize with the ball.

965
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:28,750
Anything up there?

966
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:31,119
Mister.

967
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,800
All right, stop.

968
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,800
You're hurting Otto.

969
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:37,800
No.

970
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,810
You just hit him in the head twice.

971
01:43:40,810 --> 01:43:46,100
I can't.

972
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:48,100
Hold on.

973
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,859
I need to get on...

974
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:53,289
Okay, go ahead.

975
01:43:53,289 --> 01:44:02,699
Now do the thing you were just doing.

976
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:05,260
How come this puzzle isn't solved yet?

977
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:11,140
I don't know.

978
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:13,140
I gotta phrase it. Phrase. Phrase.

979
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:23,000
Move, you thing.

980
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,880
I think this is a life lesson.

981
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:31,229
Just need a couple of boxes and it's pretty much it.

982
01:44:31,229 --> 01:44:34,180
Okay.

983
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:36,420
Oh, balls are on.

984
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:38,420
I got a new upgrade.

985
01:44:38,420 --> 01:44:40,420
Oh, you did? Well...

986
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:44,510
I'm trying to understand how to use it.

987
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:47,779
Wait, what?

988
01:44:47,779 --> 01:44:50,140
Can get another upgrade.

989
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:52,960
Oh, this is the bouncy ball.

990
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,960
Oh, it's adorable.

991
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,539
Can we bounce it around together? Oh, that's cool.

992
01:44:58,539 --> 01:45:02,380
I'm like ice farts.

993
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:14,350
I don't understand how this one works.

994
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,350
I should be able to push you off.

995
01:45:17,029 --> 01:45:19,399
This thing doesn't make any sense.

996
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:22,409
It says, okay, okay, okay.

997
01:45:22,409 --> 01:45:29,409
One conjuring an object, keep holding down left or right until the super throw is loaded.

998
01:45:29,409 --> 01:45:33,409
I can't summon a ball or anything while holding down that button.

999
01:45:33,409 --> 01:45:35,779
I'm gonna just hit.

1000
01:45:35,779 --> 01:45:43,949
Oh.

1001
01:45:43,949 --> 01:45:46,260
It doesn't make any sense.

1002
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,560
Did you just push me off?

1003
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,100
I mean, all we need right now is a couple of boxes.

1004
01:45:55,779 --> 01:45:57,779
Hold on, I'm trying to figure out my thing.

1005
01:45:57,779 --> 01:46:01,779
Here, take your stupid boxes and just solve.

1006
01:46:01,779 --> 01:46:03,779
I mean, there's not much to solve.

1007
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:05,779
We just have to jump from jump to jump.

1008
01:46:05,779 --> 01:46:07,779
If I make another one, that one's gonna disappear now.

1009
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:12,579
Oh, it didn't.

1010
01:46:12,579 --> 01:46:17,060
Okay.

1011
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:19,060
What? What?

1012
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:21,060
Oh, the spikes are coming through the plank.

1013
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,060
I have fucking no shoes on.

1014
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:25,060
Oh my god.

1015
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:29,609
No, no.

1016
01:46:29,609 --> 01:46:31,609
Whatever, go forward.

1017
01:46:32,289 --> 01:46:34,289
I'll teleport.

1018
01:46:34,289 --> 01:46:36,289
Doesn't matter. Didn't happen.

1019
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:43,710
We got a fight coming up here.

1020
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:46,720
I can't figure it out.

1021
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,729
So it's just a bouncy...

1022
01:46:49,729 --> 01:46:52,539
It's a bouncy ball.

1023
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,539
Now, I've had the bouncy ball for a while.

1024
01:46:57,170 --> 01:46:59,170
Yeah, I didn't know how to activate it.

1025
01:46:59,170 --> 01:47:03,170
But now it's when I have something over my head, I'm supposed to be able to shoot it forward.

1026
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:10,020
But the buttons don't make any sense.

1027
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:15,069
Another water puzzle coming up here.

1028
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:22,140
I'm gonna draw the object you want.

1029
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,140
We'll see if I draw the object.

1030
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:26,699
I draw a square.

1031
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:28,699
I'm holding down left click.

1032
01:47:28,699 --> 01:47:30,699
And the moment I let go, the box is made.

1033
01:47:30,699 --> 01:47:34,699
But in order to throw it forward, it's saying to keep holding down left.

1034
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:36,699
But I can't keep holding it down because I just fucking made it.

1035
01:47:36,699 --> 01:47:38,699
And I let go of left to make it.

1036
01:47:38,699 --> 01:47:42,699
But if I pick up an object, like I have this object and I hold down left, nothing happens.

1037
01:47:42,699 --> 01:47:44,699
You lost me. You lost me at like...

1038
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:46,699
Hey, are you in the Discord?

1039
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:48,699
Just start streaming.

1040
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,380
Nothing's happening.

1041
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,380
Honey.

1042
01:47:53,380 --> 01:48:00,800
Can I have a plank?

1043
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,489
Little bit more to the right.

1044
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:05,489
Little bit more.

1045
01:48:05,489 --> 01:48:07,489
Yeah.

1046
01:48:07,489 --> 01:48:09,489
Yeah.

1047
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:11,920
Honey.

1048
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,920
But this time it goes down there.

1049
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,159
And there.

1050
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:18,909
Look at that.

1051
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:26,850
Hey, Koryn.

1052
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:30,739
I think we can go up here.

1053
01:48:30,739 --> 01:48:38,289
There's a spike there.

1054
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,970
Now how do we get up there?

1055
01:48:40,970 --> 01:48:44,680
Another one? Another rock?

1056
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:54,579
Yep.

1057
01:48:54,579 --> 01:48:56,579
Cool. It was a big one.

1058
01:48:56,579 --> 01:48:58,579
It's right click. I've held right click.

1059
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:00,579
I'm holding right click to pick this up right now.

1060
01:49:00,579 --> 01:49:02,579
It says release right click and it'll shoot.

1061
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:07,579
I'm holding left click.

1062
01:49:07,579 --> 01:49:09,579
Like nothing it says is true.

1063
01:49:09,579 --> 01:49:11,579
Do you remember what a pine cone is?

1064
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:13,579
And it says when conjuring an object.

1065
01:49:13,579 --> 01:49:15,579
So I can press Q to conjure this?

1066
01:49:15,579 --> 01:49:18,199
Or hold on.

1067
01:49:18,199 --> 01:49:20,199
I can press...

1068
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,039
Which one is...

1069
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:27,039
I forgot what button the box is.

1070
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:29,039
Press F to hold left click.

1071
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:31,039
Then once I hold left click I'm fucking moving it.

1072
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:33,039
Nothing about this.

1073
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:35,039
I'm just trying to get over to the other side.

1074
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:37,039
Okay, there we go.

1075
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:39,039
I have to hold left click and not on it.

1076
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:41,039
And then it primes it in a random spot.

1077
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:43,039
Okay, we figured it out.

1078
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:45,039
Steve, they're all accusing you

1079
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:47,039
of being bald the longer this rank goes on.

1080
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,600
No.

1081
01:49:49,600 --> 01:50:00,020
I'm good.

1082
01:50:10,409 --> 01:50:12,409
You guys need help?

1083
01:50:12,409 --> 01:50:14,409
Fuck, no. I just did this.

1084
01:50:14,409 --> 01:50:25,399
Pipe incoming.

1085
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:27,399
Wait a minute, but how do we block that?

1086
01:50:27,399 --> 01:50:29,399
So I can shoot the arrow.

1087
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:31,399
I understand. Like if I pick up a box I can't launch it ever.

1088
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:33,399
Because I have to do it when I conjure it.

1089
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:35,399
Why is this moving like this?

1090
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:39,239
How?

1091
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:48,569
You can't even kill it.

1092
01:50:48,569 --> 01:50:50,569
I mean, it's fun.

1093
01:50:50,569 --> 01:50:52,569
Right now the star is in his own server

1094
01:50:52,569 --> 01:50:54,569
shooting bots.

1095
01:50:54,569 --> 01:51:01,029
Hello?

1096
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:03,710
Hello? Can you hear me?

1097
01:51:03,710 --> 01:51:05,710
Yeah.

1098
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,710
Okay. My mom was calling me.

1099
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:09,710
I'm sorry.

1100
01:51:09,710 --> 01:51:11,710
You hung up on her?

1101
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:13,710
No, she was calling me to come down for dinner.

1102
01:51:13,710 --> 01:51:16,720
So.

1103
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:23,060
That's a lie.

1104
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:25,060
Okay, now I'm going to shoot that.

1105
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,060
Oh, no, I can't.

1106
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,060
Can someone get rid of this bouncy ball?

1107
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:54,140
I don't know. Maybe we should ask the wizard.

1108
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,140
Get this ball out of here. Come on.

1109
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,140
I like the balls a lot. I'm sorry.

1110
01:51:58,819 --> 01:52:00,819
Do you have a rock concert?

1111
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:05,560
Is there a beach ball flying around?

1112
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:08,250
No.

1113
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:21,560
Oh, boss. Boss.

1114
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:23,989
Boss prince.

1115
01:52:23,989 --> 01:52:27,449
Look at him moping.

1116
01:52:39,449 --> 01:52:41,449
You have to kill yourself.

1117
01:52:45,939 --> 01:52:47,939
So he's a bad guy.

1118
01:52:47,939 --> 01:52:50,939
Nothing.

1119
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:55,300
No.

1120
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:57,300
My mentor.

1121
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:07,479
So we have to fight the

1122
01:53:07,479 --> 01:53:09,479
three of them at the same time.

1123
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:11,479
The three gay dads.

1124
01:53:11,479 --> 01:53:13,479
How do we do this?

1125
01:53:13,479 --> 01:53:15,479
Wait, these are your three dads?

1126
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,159
And we're all Pontius?

1127
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,159
Why?

1128
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:22,590
I don't even know how to play.

1129
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:24,590
How do you do the dash?

1130
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:26,829
Oh, shit.

1131
01:53:26,829 --> 01:53:28,829
I think we should bounce back his big ball

1132
01:53:28,829 --> 01:53:30,829
at our dad.

1133
01:53:30,829 --> 01:53:32,829
Oh, now is when the upgrades would matter.

1134
01:53:32,829 --> 01:53:37,180
I guess.

1135
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,180
They switched me to a different Pontius.

1136
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:41,180
That's stupid.

1137
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:49,500
Oh, we got a launch.

1138
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,939
Watch the top left.

1139
01:53:51,939 --> 01:53:56,220
Can we pick that up?

1140
01:53:56,899 --> 01:53:58,899
Yeah, I bet you guys wish you had a bouncy ball right now.

1141
01:53:58,899 --> 01:54:01,460
He just broke our shields.

1142
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:06,579
Oh, shit.

1143
01:54:06,579 --> 01:54:08,579
I kind of do.

1144
01:54:08,579 --> 01:54:12,039
This is kind of messy.

1145
01:54:12,039 --> 01:54:14,039
We've got to get rid of their forcefields first.

1146
01:54:14,039 --> 01:54:18,949
Oh.

1147
01:54:18,949 --> 01:54:23,050
He's going to throw it.

1148
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:25,479
Oh, that was a bad idea.

1149
01:54:25,479 --> 01:54:30,859
Oh, you have to dash and hit him.

1150
01:54:30,859 --> 01:54:32,859
Honestly, he's the strongest dad.

1151
01:54:32,859 --> 01:54:35,609
Daddy, why?

1152
01:54:35,609 --> 01:54:43,079
Watch the left.

1153
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:45,079
No, we were too tall. He was too tall.

1154
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:51,890
Oh, fuck.

1155
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:56,180
Where did I go?

1156
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,180
I don't even know where I am.

1157
01:54:58,180 --> 01:55:00,180
Oh, yeah. Dead.

1158
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:02,180
Steve, you're alive.

1159
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:04,800
Rez.

1160
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,800
I just rezzed into a sword in the head.

1161
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,869
Where's the heals?

1162
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:17,739
Focus now.

1163
01:55:17,739 --> 01:55:20,109
Wait, I was alive?

1164
01:55:20,109 --> 01:55:25,939
Geez, we beat the shit out of them.

1165
01:55:25,939 --> 01:55:27,939
Oh, my God.

1166
01:55:27,939 --> 01:55:29,939
Look at that hot dad pile.

1167
01:55:29,939 --> 01:55:32,109
Fucking dead.

1168
01:55:32,789 --> 01:55:35,420
You know, we're not saving a prince.

1169
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:37,420
Celius is turning into a villain.

1170
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,420
And you know what we do with villains.

1171
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:41,420
Zoya is right.

1172
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:43,420
If we can't save the prince,

1173
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,420
we're going to have to fight him.

1174
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,420
We're going to bring him to court.

1175
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:49,420
Well, geez, you just slaughtered your whole family.

1176
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,420
Hello?

1177
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:53,420
You have a problem? Hello?

1178
01:55:53,420 --> 01:55:55,420
Dude, heaven.

1179
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,420
Crackling Maya.

1180
01:55:57,420 --> 01:55:59,420
Distressed by their last encounter with Celius,

1181
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:01,420
the heroes continued their dogged pursuit

1182
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:04,100
into the wild woodlands.

1183
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,100
As night grew closer,

1184
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:08,100
there was no sight nor sound

1185
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:10,100
of Celius.

1186
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,100
And the heroes found themselves

1187
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:16,640
dreadfully lost.

1188
01:56:16,640 --> 01:56:19,140
Oh, no.

1189
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:23,789
What? What are you doing?

1190
01:56:23,789 --> 01:56:26,609
I'm trying to start the level.

1191
01:56:26,609 --> 01:56:32,619
No.

1192
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:34,619
It screwed up all our characters.

1193
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:36,859
What do we do now?

1194
01:56:36,859 --> 01:56:38,859
What's the tool?

1195
01:56:38,859 --> 01:56:40,859
Instead of pursuing,

1196
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:44,550
what is Jackbox?

1197
01:56:44,550 --> 01:56:49,590
Where's Jack?

1198
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:52,149
Where's Jack?

1199
01:56:52,149 --> 01:57:02,649
Where's Jack?

1200
01:57:02,649 --> 01:57:04,649
Here, speedrun. We don't need the extra objectives anymore.

1201
01:57:04,649 --> 01:57:06,649
We don't have all our attribute points.

1202
01:57:06,649 --> 01:57:08,649
It's speedrun time.

1203
01:57:08,649 --> 01:57:11,270
Fine.

1204
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:14,470
Fine. All right, fine.

1205
01:57:14,470 --> 01:57:17,159
It's time to observe

1206
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:19,159
our place across the quest

1207
01:57:19,159 --> 01:57:21,159
and whatever she's saying.

1208
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:23,159
The ground is made out of electricity.

1209
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:25,399
Step on it! Let's go!

1210
01:57:31,399 --> 01:57:36,460
Jump into any ponds after strange ladies.

1211
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:38,460
Oh, and that's electrified as well

1212
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:40,819
because it's in the electricity.

1213
01:57:40,819 --> 01:57:42,819
Is that electrified? No.

1214
01:57:42,819 --> 01:57:46,859
That's wood.

1215
01:57:46,859 --> 01:57:48,859
That's electrified.

1216
01:57:48,859 --> 01:57:50,859
I'm just so used to jumping on stuff.

1217
01:57:50,859 --> 01:57:53,859
I know.

1218
01:57:53,859 --> 01:57:56,300
No longer electrified. Can I freeze it?

1219
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:59,619
No.

1220
01:57:59,619 --> 01:58:01,619
You did it double power. You made it twice as more powerful.

1221
01:58:01,619 --> 01:58:03,619
Oh my god, I can kill you guys so easily now.

1222
01:58:03,619 --> 01:58:06,250
You always could.

1223
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:08,619
I know.

1224
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:18,060
Power was in the all along. Up top.

1225
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:29,060
Oh, that didn't work.

1226
01:58:29,060 --> 01:58:31,060
We're just going fast now.

1227
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:35,060
Jerma said I was good at going fast.

1228
01:58:35,060 --> 01:58:37,060
Yes, you are.

1229
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:39,060
I didn't say the two of us were either.

1230
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,060
Time for me to shine.

1231
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:43,060
Race, race, race.

1232
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:45,060
It's electricity.

1233
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,060
I'm jumping in it.

1234
01:58:47,060 --> 01:58:51,600
Well, what do we...

1235
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:56,979
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1236
01:58:56,979 --> 01:58:58,979
Get off of it.

1237
01:58:59,659 --> 01:59:01,659
Oh my god, guys. Please get off of it.

1238
01:59:01,659 --> 01:59:03,659
Ashley, please get off.

1239
01:59:03,659 --> 01:59:06,409
You're...

1240
01:59:06,409 --> 01:59:08,840
Okay.

1241
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,840
Okay. Pretty good.

1242
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:12,840
Nice work.

1243
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:14,840
You have to shoot the rope.

1244
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:21,300
Shoot the rope.

1245
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:24,819
Something happened.

1246
01:59:24,819 --> 01:59:26,819
You need to build a boat.

1247
01:59:26,819 --> 01:59:29,189
Ow!

1248
01:59:29,189 --> 01:59:31,189
That didn't look electrified.

1249
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:33,189
I don't think we can get over this.

1250
01:59:33,189 --> 01:59:38,359
Build a what?

1251
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:41,039
I thought you didn't want to collect these anymore.

1252
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:43,729
Well, you guys were...

1253
01:59:43,729 --> 01:59:46,479
I was waiting for you to shoot the rope for like an hour.

1254
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:49,420
Like a full hour.

1255
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:51,420
How do we open this?

1256
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:57,500
Oh, the connection needs to be met.

1257
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:59,500
Right?

1258
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:01,500
Pull the box out of the way.

1259
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,680
You have to rope it again, I think.

1260
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:06,880
Just lift up the box.

1261
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:08,880
No, no, no. Get it out of the way.

1262
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:12,340
Tell me what to do again.

1263
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:14,340
I'll come to your house and say hello.

1264
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,640
I'll say hi.

1265
02:00:24,979 --> 02:00:27,779
What?

1266
02:00:27,779 --> 02:00:30,920
I died inside of this thing.

1267
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:34,439
That thing explodes.

1268
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:39,560
That's a full party life.

1269
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:42,569
Shit.

1270
02:00:42,569 --> 02:00:51,340
That's bullshit. I have plate mail.

1271
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,340
I'm going to freeze the guy that's electrified.

1272
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:55,340
He's causing all the problems.

1273
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:59,100
There's the duck.

1274
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:02,220
Ooh!

1275
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:07,529
Two ropes at the same time.

1276
02:01:07,529 --> 02:01:09,529
That's so cool. How do I do two ropes at the same time?

1277
02:01:09,529 --> 02:01:11,529
I can use two ropes at the same time.

1278
02:01:11,529 --> 02:01:13,529
Okay.

1279
02:01:15,149 --> 02:01:17,149
Get it out of the way.

1280
02:01:17,149 --> 02:01:19,699
Me and Ashley are going over.

1281
02:01:19,699 --> 02:01:22,380
What are you doing?

1282
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:25,710
We're going over.

1283
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,710
That's really cool that you have two ropes.

1284
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:29,710
We're going over.

1285
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:44,739
Whatever.

1286
02:01:44,739 --> 02:01:46,739
It's so hard to tell.

1287
02:01:46,739 --> 02:01:49,680
It is.

1288
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:51,680
Do I have a wood plank anywhere?

1289
02:01:51,680 --> 02:02:00,260
No, I don't.

1290
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,689
Can you plank us?

1291
02:02:02,689 --> 02:02:04,689
They get electrified.

1292
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:06,689
Anything I do gets electrified.

1293
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:09,670
Even the bouncy ball.

1294
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:11,670
Maybe the bouncy ball doesn't bounce.

1295
02:02:11,670 --> 02:02:14,420
You need a rubber.

1296
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:17,880
It is rubberized.

1297
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:20,890
It's only science.

1298
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:22,890
This is hard though.

1299
02:02:24,890 --> 02:02:26,890
That was almost a full party life.

1300
02:02:26,890 --> 02:02:28,890
That was almost a full party life.

1301
02:02:28,890 --> 02:02:32,090
Without respawn timers.

1302
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,090
At least somebody got up there.

1303
02:02:36,090 --> 02:02:38,090
That's definitely what you have to do.

1304
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:40,260
I think we only need one of these

1305
02:02:40,939 --> 02:02:42,939
and the second one is causing a problem.

1306
02:02:46,939 --> 02:02:48,939
I was grabbing the edge.

1307
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:50,939
I made it.

1308
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:53,250
We have to be safe.

1309
02:02:53,250 --> 02:02:55,250
Move over.

1310
02:02:55,250 --> 02:03:01,569
I got a link.

1311
02:03:01,569 --> 02:03:03,869
Does that have to stay there?

1312
02:03:03,869 --> 02:03:06,109
What is it doing?

1313
02:03:06,109 --> 02:03:08,109
It's opening the door.

1314
02:03:08,109 --> 02:03:12,529
Is it?

1315
02:03:12,529 --> 02:03:15,020
It is.

1316
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:17,020
The top door is opening.

1317
02:03:17,699 --> 02:03:19,699
Can you grab that wood plank?

1318
02:03:19,699 --> 02:03:25,529
There's a wood plank up there on the left.

1319
02:03:27,529 --> 02:03:29,529
He got too close.

1320
02:03:29,529 --> 02:03:38,489
Hold on.

1321
02:03:38,489 --> 02:03:42,260
I wish I could unsummon things.

1322
02:03:42,260 --> 02:03:45,590
I got that out of the way.

1323
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:52,439
It's everywhere.

1324
02:03:52,439 --> 02:03:54,439
Every time I try to move something

1325
02:03:54,439 --> 02:03:56,439
someone touches it.

1326
02:03:56,439 --> 02:03:58,439
I want to die too.

1327
02:03:58,439 --> 02:04:02,220
I could have made it.

1328
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:04,710
I'm stuck here.

1329
02:04:04,710 --> 02:04:06,710
You made it up there.

1330
02:04:07,390 --> 02:04:09,390
I can't freeze it.

1331
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:11,390
Please stop touching my wood.

1332
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:13,390
I'm touching your wood.

1333
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:15,390
Now walk forward.

1334
02:04:30,949 --> 02:04:32,949
Watch that connection.

1335
02:04:32,949 --> 02:04:36,859
Why did I not grab the edge?

1336
02:04:36,859 --> 02:04:38,859
Pull it up.

1337
02:04:38,859 --> 02:04:41,220
Just launch me.

1338
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:43,960
What?

1339
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,520
The door is not open.

1340
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:51,319
It is.

1341
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:53,319
This box was slightly not there.

1342
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Have fun you two.

1343
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,010
Get to a place where I can die.

1344
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:03,680
Quietly.

1345
02:05:03,680 --> 02:05:05,680
You come across.

1346
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:07,680
One at a time.

1347
02:05:07,680 --> 02:05:12,670
Very fast.

1348
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:15,810
We're so good.

1349
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:24,000
Maybe even the best.

1350
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:41,329
That was slick.

1351
02:05:45,329 --> 02:05:48,020
What's this for?

1352
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:50,020
Secret?

1353
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:52,020
I was told no secrets.

1354
02:05:52,699 --> 02:05:54,699
No secrets.

1355
02:05:54,699 --> 02:05:56,699
Look at you trying to get secrets.

1356
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:58,699
That wasn't a secret.

1357
02:05:58,699 --> 02:06:00,699
That was just trying to get the thing.

1358
02:06:00,699 --> 02:06:02,699
Trying to get the thing?

1359
02:06:02,699 --> 02:06:04,699
Oh my God.

1360
02:06:04,699 --> 02:06:06,699
Remember if another streamer

1361
02:06:06,699 --> 02:06:08,699
does a terrible joke

1362
02:06:08,699 --> 02:06:10,699
it's not my fault.

1363
02:06:10,699 --> 02:06:12,699
You endorse everything we say.

1364
02:06:12,699 --> 02:06:14,699
Just by us being here.

1365
02:06:14,699 --> 02:06:16,699
They just don't like when you do it.

1366
02:06:16,699 --> 02:06:18,699
Now they don't.

1367
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:21,380
What now?

1368
02:06:21,380 --> 02:06:23,380
Now I'm going to freeze

1369
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:25,380
this one.

1370
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:27,380
Ball.

1371
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:29,380
Give me that ball.

1372
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:31,380
I'm going to sneak this way.

1373
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,939
You froze it.

1374
02:06:33,939 --> 02:06:37,069
You're good.

1375
02:06:37,069 --> 02:06:39,310
I'm going.

1376
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:41,310
They're trying to kill us.

1377
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:53,789
Wait.

1378
02:06:53,789 --> 02:06:58,270
Wait.

1379
02:06:58,270 --> 02:07:02,430
Why would we wait?

1380
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:08,380
Oh my God.

1381
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,260
The whole screen is death right now.

1382
02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:14,260
Don't break that barrel.

1383
02:07:14,260 --> 02:07:17,529
I'm paying you to never make that joke again.

1384
02:07:17,529 --> 02:07:21,050
I've got a few more.

1385
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:24,890
I think you can just

1386
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:27,060
I can just do this.

1387
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:29,060
No. This.

1388
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:31,060
No. This.

1389
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:36,760
I want to grab the...

1390
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:40,409
No.

1391
02:07:40,409 --> 02:07:42,409
Maybe we need more weight up here?

1392
02:07:42,409 --> 02:07:44,409
That's a thing.

1393
02:07:44,409 --> 02:07:46,409
Get that box off there.

1394
02:07:46,409 --> 02:07:52,539
Oh God.

1395
02:07:53,220 --> 02:07:55,579
Hey.

1396
02:07:55,579 --> 02:08:08,180
I'm over here.

1397
02:08:08,180 --> 02:08:11,439
You can ice block.

1398
02:08:11,439 --> 02:08:13,439
The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.

1399
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:15,439
We can't make that jump though. We need a box.

1400
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:17,439
The ice doesn't seem to be frozen.

1401
02:08:17,439 --> 02:08:19,439
The box is frozen.

1402
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:21,439
The box is frozen.

1403
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:23,439
If you do that

1404
02:08:23,439 --> 02:08:27,340
that works.

1405
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:29,340
Now we just have to figure out how to go from here to there.

1406
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:33,699
Probably with

1407
02:08:33,699 --> 02:08:37,220
a box maybe?

1408
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,779
A ball?

1409
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:44,279
Wait a minute.

1410
02:08:44,279 --> 02:08:46,279
I think we can do this.

1411
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:49,029
Hold on.

1412
02:08:49,029 --> 02:08:51,029
What?

1413
02:08:51,029 --> 02:08:56,579
Why did that happen?

1414
02:08:56,579 --> 02:08:58,579
You know what we got to do.

1415
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:02,039
You know what it's time for.

1416
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:04,039
That's what I just said.

1417
02:09:04,039 --> 02:09:06,220
That didn't work.

1418
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:08,220
Start it over.

1419
02:09:08,220 --> 02:09:10,840
Wait.

1420
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:13,140
Give me another one.

1421
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:18,840
Come on. Give me that.

1422
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:21,590
It doesn't bounce that high.

1423
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:24,270
This is the worst thing in the world.

1424
02:09:24,270 --> 02:09:26,270
I thought it was going to bounce high.

1425
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:33,680
It's certainly not what they want you to do.

1426
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:36,050
It's certainly not what they want you to do.

1427
02:09:36,050 --> 02:09:38,670
Come on. This will work.

1428
02:09:38,670 --> 02:09:40,670
I definitely have to make a...

1429
02:09:40,670 --> 02:09:42,670
Put a box over here.

1430
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:44,670
Not on the ice.

1431
02:09:44,670 --> 02:09:46,670
Put a box on the ice.

1432
02:09:46,670 --> 02:09:48,670
I can just do this.

1433
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:50,670
Why did you die?

1434
02:09:50,670 --> 02:09:59,420
Something funky going on.

1435
02:09:59,420 --> 02:10:01,729
Game?

1436
02:10:01,729 --> 02:10:03,729
Now that's safe.

1437
02:10:04,409 --> 02:10:07,100
Just launch one of us up there.

1438
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:11,899
Okay.

1439
02:10:11,899 --> 02:10:13,899
Yoink.

1440
02:10:13,899 --> 02:10:17,159
We got it.

1441
02:10:17,159 --> 02:10:22,090
Just solve it with box physics.

1442
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:24,840
Do we need that ball for anything?

1443
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:26,840
I guess not.

1444
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:30,100
Probably.

1445
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:44,949
This guy's got to go.

1446
02:10:44,949 --> 02:10:46,949
Skellington.

1447
02:10:46,949 --> 02:10:48,949
Those things can destroy my ropes.

1448
02:10:48,949 --> 02:10:50,949
Those things can destroy my ropes.

1449
02:10:50,949 --> 02:10:52,949
Those things can destroy my ropes.

1450
02:10:52,949 --> 02:10:54,949
Just block those holes.

1451
02:10:55,630 --> 02:11:01,520
No.

1452
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,819
I just saved my...

1453
02:11:03,819 --> 02:11:05,819
Okay.

1454
02:11:05,819 --> 02:11:07,819
Just do rope, rope, rope.

1455
02:11:07,819 --> 02:11:09,819
Get this box out of the way.

1456
02:11:09,819 --> 02:11:11,819
It targets the box.

1457
02:11:11,819 --> 02:11:13,819
I can't destroy the box.

1458
02:11:13,819 --> 02:11:15,819
Okay.

1459
02:11:15,819 --> 02:11:17,819
There's that one.

1460
02:11:17,819 --> 02:11:19,819
I can do another one from here to there.

1461
02:11:19,819 --> 02:11:22,510
From here to there.

1462
02:11:22,510 --> 02:11:25,069
I don't know if that helps.

1463
02:11:25,069 --> 02:11:29,300
There you go.

1464
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:31,300
Do bouncy balls.

1465
02:11:31,979 --> 02:11:33,979
Okay.

1466
02:11:33,979 --> 02:11:35,979
I can go across.

1467
02:11:35,979 --> 02:11:42,819
Just block both the holes.

1468
02:11:42,819 --> 02:11:44,819
Okay.

1469
02:11:44,819 --> 02:11:48,279
Okay.

1470
02:11:48,279 --> 02:11:51,350
Oh my god.

1471
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:53,350
Okay.

1472
02:11:53,350 --> 02:11:55,350
I made it.

1473
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:57,529
Good.

1474
02:11:57,529 --> 02:11:59,529
I think this is the result we were looking for.

1475
02:11:59,529 --> 02:12:06,180
I just can't die.

1476
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:08,180
Just keep going.

1477
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:10,180
I died.

1478
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:12,180
It's impossible.

1479
02:12:12,859 --> 02:12:15,810
If I do this...

1480
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:17,810
I can make that.

1481
02:12:17,810 --> 02:12:23,569
I can't make that.

1482
02:12:23,569 --> 02:12:26,449
How did that work?

1483
02:12:26,449 --> 02:12:28,449
Okay. I'm going to shit my pants.

1484
02:12:28,449 --> 02:12:31,390
I already did.

1485
02:12:31,390 --> 02:12:35,090
Same.

1486
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:37,090
I need to shoot the one below.

1487
02:12:43,409 --> 02:12:46,930
Did I get it?

1488
02:12:46,930 --> 02:12:49,229
Where am I?

1489
02:12:49,229 --> 02:12:53,840
I'm currently still alive.

1490
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,850
How did I end up back here?

1491
02:12:56,850 --> 02:13:02,609
Things are getting goofy, guys.

1492
02:13:03,289 --> 02:13:11,979
They are.

1493
02:13:11,979 --> 02:13:13,979
There has to be a button to unsummon.

1494
02:13:13,979 --> 02:13:18,060
I can't.

1495
02:13:18,060 --> 02:13:20,060
They're stuck.

1496
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:23,579
I need to cut this.

1497
02:13:23,579 --> 02:13:25,579
Let me get this thing out of here.

1498
02:13:25,579 --> 02:13:27,880
Get that ball out of here.

1499
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:32,229
It's attached still.

1500
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:35,430
It has a rope on it in the back.

1501
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:37,800
It shouldn't have any ropes.

1502
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,800
I think it's wanting you to go under the bottom.

1503
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:43,319
Attach to the thing on the top.

1504
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:45,319
It's electrified.

1505
02:13:45,319 --> 02:13:47,319
Yeah.

1506
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Rope from these.

1507
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,199
And swing to the other side.

1508
02:13:53,199 --> 02:14:00,560
Do you understand?

1509
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:06,130
Hold on.

1510
02:14:06,130 --> 02:14:08,750
I have to have it be small.

1511
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:11,310
I can now ride it all the way across.

1512
02:14:11,310 --> 02:14:13,310
Now you have a lever.

1513
02:14:13,310 --> 02:14:28,529
Pull it!

1514
02:14:28,529 --> 02:14:30,529
Don't destroy this.

1515
02:14:30,529 --> 02:14:32,529
I guess they just explode when they touch lightning.

1516
02:14:32,529 --> 02:14:34,960
I think they just exploded in general.

1517
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:36,960
It's a little electrified.

1518
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:42,979
You can rub it.

1519
02:14:42,979 --> 02:14:44,979
There's a rope.

1520
02:14:45,659 --> 02:14:47,659
It's sticky.

1521
02:14:47,659 --> 02:14:54,420
Very sticky.

1522
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:57,109
Now we're getting high level.

1523
02:14:57,109 --> 02:14:59,109
That's not electrified.

1524
02:14:59,109 --> 02:15:03,340
Which one should I freeze?

1525
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:05,340
Left one?

1526
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:08,600
Sure.

1527
02:15:08,600 --> 02:15:10,600
If you can.

1528
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:12,600
I think you can just get over here.

1529
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:15,800
There's a safe spot.

1530
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:18,619
There's a safe spot right over there.

1531
02:15:18,619 --> 02:15:20,920
Okay.

1532
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:22,920
I can just launch someone.

1533
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:24,920
Oh God.

1534
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:30,020
Hold on.

1535
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:33,979
Yep.

1536
02:15:33,979 --> 02:15:37,819
I can just hold on.

1537
02:15:37,819 --> 02:15:40,510
Now you don't have to worry.

1538
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:42,510
Now you're safe.

1539
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:57,470
Okay.

1540
02:15:57,470 --> 02:15:59,899
Enjoy your Kinect.

1541
02:15:59,899 --> 02:16:04,770
You get to play Kinect.

1542
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:14,239
C-O-N-N-E-C-T.

1543
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:16,239
Working for a second. Can you freeze?

1544
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:18,239
We got to wait for this to come around

1545
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:21,180
and it's going to work.

1546
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:27,779
Oh my God.

1547
02:16:27,779 --> 02:16:30,979
Jerma!

1548
02:16:31,659 --> 02:16:33,659
Where are we?

1549
02:16:33,659 --> 02:16:36,020
Can you freeze the top thing?

1550
02:16:36,020 --> 02:16:38,020
No.

1551
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:40,020
I said no as I pressed it

1552
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:42,020
and did it.

1553
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:45,100
No.

1554
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:54,250
It breaks the eye.

1555
02:16:54,250 --> 02:17:03,379
Do it.

1556
02:17:03,379 --> 02:17:07,219
What? Now it's not breaking.

1557
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:09,719
You have to electrify the top one.

1558
02:17:09,719 --> 02:17:11,719
Like that.

1559
02:17:11,719 --> 02:17:13,719
It broke last time though.

1560
02:17:13,719 --> 02:17:19,479
What?

1561
02:17:19,479 --> 02:17:21,479
Maybe because we didn't compliment you enough.

1562
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:29,950
That was fun.

1563
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:31,950
Jerma shot it, did he?

1564
02:17:31,950 --> 02:17:33,950
Did he ruin the whole thing?

1565
02:17:33,950 --> 02:17:35,950
I don't think he did.

1566
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:38,450
Oh, she's pregnant.

1567
02:17:38,450 --> 02:17:40,450
What the fuck?

1568
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:42,450
What?

1569
02:17:42,450 --> 02:17:45,649
The fuck?

1570
02:17:45,649 --> 02:17:54,030
Are you talking about?

1571
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:16,690
What do we got for a time?

1572
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:18,690
It was currently 3 o'clock.

1573
02:18:18,690 --> 02:18:20,690
Pacific.

1574
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,690
Do you want a jack?

1575
02:18:22,690 --> 02:18:24,860
It might be jack time.

1576
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,860
Did it jack off?

1577
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:29,420
No.

1578
02:18:29,420 --> 02:18:31,420
What?

1579
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:33,420
Jerma has it pre-scheduled every day.

1580
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:35,420
Now that he's changed stream schedules,

1581
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:37,420
it's messing with us a bit.

1582
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:39,420
His house is full of alarm clocks

1583
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:41,420
and they all go off.

1584
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:43,420
3, 4, 3.30, 3.10.

1585
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:48,420
Time to jack.

1586
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:50,420
The next time anybody dies,

1587
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:52,420
we move on.

1588
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:54,420
The next time anybody dies,

1589
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:56,420
we move on to jack box.

1590
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:58,420
He's about to jump off the mat.

1591
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:00,420
Try as hard as you can.

1592
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:03,100
I guess we're in for another fishing camp.

1593
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:10,860
Okay.

1594
02:19:10,860 --> 02:19:15,260
I'm trying so hard.

1595
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:17,260
There we go.

1596
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:25,899
Freeze it.

1597
02:19:26,579 --> 02:19:29,590
Fight.

1598
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:35,860
I don't want to see any deaths here.

1599
02:19:35,860 --> 02:19:52,100
I got you.

1600
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:54,100
Why is that frozen?

1601
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:57,620
It has the fairy rope.

1602
02:19:57,620 --> 02:19:59,620
When attaching a rope to a loose object,

1603
02:19:59,620 --> 02:20:04,420
keep holding down.

1604
02:20:04,420 --> 02:20:07,049
Keep holding down.

1605
02:20:07,049 --> 02:20:10,549
What does that mean?

1606
02:20:10,549 --> 02:20:12,549
Tie the rope to the hook.

1607
02:20:12,549 --> 02:20:14,549
I can just walk it?

1608
02:20:14,549 --> 02:20:16,549
Can you get your ball out of the way?

1609
02:20:16,549 --> 02:20:18,549
I can't because people keep walking on it

1610
02:20:18,549 --> 02:20:20,549
and getting stuck on things.

1611
02:20:21,229 --> 02:20:26,670
I don't understand.

1612
02:20:26,670 --> 02:20:28,670
What did that rope do?

1613
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:30,670
Hold on.

1614
02:20:30,670 --> 02:20:32,670
It just pulls it up.

1615
02:20:32,670 --> 02:20:34,850
So no matter what,

1616
02:20:34,850 --> 02:20:36,850
it's going to pull.

1617
02:20:36,850 --> 02:20:38,850
It looks like he just intentionally walked to his death

1618
02:20:38,850 --> 02:20:40,850
because he wants the jack.

1619
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:42,850
Jack box.

1620
02:20:42,850 --> 02:20:45,280
That's right.

1621
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:47,459
It's time.

1622
02:20:47,459 --> 02:20:50,659
Who knew that Germa would die first?

1623
02:20:50,659 --> 02:20:52,659
Who knew that Germa would die first?

1624
02:20:52,659 --> 02:20:54,659
I was just trying to work it out.

1625
02:20:55,340 --> 02:21:00,649
I was just trying to work it out.

1626
02:21:00,649 --> 02:21:02,649
All right.

1627
02:21:02,649 --> 02:21:04,649
Jack box party pack six.

1628
02:21:04,649 --> 02:21:06,649
You guys don't need it.

1629
02:21:06,649 --> 02:21:10,360
I don't think anybody needs it but me, right?

1630
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:12,360
That's how it was traditionally.

1631
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:14,360
I think we just need the website

1632
02:21:14,360 --> 02:21:16,360
and the code.

1633
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:18,360
So don't give out the code on stream.

1634
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:20,360
No, no, no.

1635
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:22,360
You're pretty amateur.

1636
02:21:22,360 --> 02:21:24,360
No, I have sub discord.

1637
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:26,360
I don't put it in the stream.

1638
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:28,360
Give it to us.

1639
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,040
I'm not in your sub discord.

1640
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,409
I've been subbed to you

1641
02:21:33,409 --> 02:21:35,409
for like seven years.

1642
02:21:35,409 --> 02:21:37,649
I've never taken it off.

1643
02:21:37,649 --> 02:21:41,680
All right, let me switch.

1644
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:43,680
Just give me one second.

1645
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,680
All right, give me a sec.

1646
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,680
Everybody take like a break.

1647
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,680
How about like a two minute, three minute break?

1648
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,680
Go pee, get some water.

1649
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,649
And when you come back, jack box will be going strong.

1650
02:21:55,649 --> 02:21:57,649
Sounds good. Be right back.
