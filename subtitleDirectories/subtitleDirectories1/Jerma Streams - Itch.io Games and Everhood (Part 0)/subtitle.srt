1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,440
Hello everybody, welcome to the Christmas Eve stream.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,019
I am ready to rock and roll.

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,539
Oh, what's up? What's up? What's up?

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:20,739
Good to see everybody again.

5
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:24,739
Uh, I don't... Alright, I turned on the stream I think already.

6
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:31,089
Now I'm Ken Haido. Welcome, welcome. How are you? Welcome to the stream. Good to see you.

7
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:36,850
Merry Christmas. It actually might be Christmas.

8
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,850
In some parts of the world right now. Very possible.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,789
What time is it? 4.30?

10
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,189
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. It is almost Christmas.

11
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:58,579
In EU?

12
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,579
Hey man, keep it down. I'm trying to sleep.

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,820
Wake up! It is! Oh, it's Christmas right now. Alright.

14
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,930
Yeah!

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,930
How was your peppermint mocha? Okay, let me... I have to explain.

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,930
And I'm still suffering right now, by the way.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,680
So...

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,049
Uh...

19
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,799
I was in the Christmas spirit.

20
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,739
I was very, very excited for the holiday.

21
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:31,739
So, I... You know, you get flavor for a coffee. You get like one of those creamers.

22
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,239
And I got peppermint mocha flavored creamer.

23
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,739
Like, oh, this is fucking Christmas time. Let's go.

24
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,909
So, I mean...

25
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,290
I drank like three of them. Three coffees with it, in it.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,849
And, uh... It was delicious, by the way.

27
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,540
Then I had to go to the bathroom.

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,780
And I'll be very, very honest with you.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
I had to go to the bathroom again.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,459
What?

31
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,459
We hold it for the stream because it's Christmas Eve.

32
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,459
And I... I'm holding it for Santa.

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,139
It's one of those things that comes in waves.

34
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:14,139
For those of you that understand and can get my drift.

35
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:19,370
I'm fine. I'm kidding. Oh, my God.

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,800
By the way, I have no idea what I look like.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,979
Um...

38
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,979
This is gonna be a surprise to all of us, I think.

39
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,979
This is gonna be a shocker to all of us.

40
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:35,270
I'm just gonna look at the preview and see what I look like.

41
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:49,460
Ah, it's a blistery day here.

42
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,240
Father Christmas?

43
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Look at how fucking much older I look.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
And look at how wet my hair is still.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,259
I haven't shaved.

46
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:04,259
Look at how, like, I look like it... Okay.

47
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,819
You'd probably think I got hacked if you saw the thumbnail, right?

48
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,819
If you saw this thumbnail,

49
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,460
it's like, who's this guy on Jerma's channel?

50
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,159
And why is the channel hacked?

51
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,460
It's my secret identity.

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,460
Yeah, this is like this bullshit disguise that...

53
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,460
Oh, yeah. I'm Superman, by the way.

54
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,460
I just put on glasses, put my hair back, and have a mustache.

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,860
God, I should just fucking leave halfway through the stream

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,860
and play a video of, like, a bus getting rescued or something.

57
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,610
Hold on to that one.

58
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,039
Imagine I'm just sitting here just playing normally.

59
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,710
I'm just like, oh, wow, look out.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,710
Oh, nice, headshot.

61
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,580
And then be like, headshot.

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,580
Hey, guys, I gotta take a quick shit.

63
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,580
It's diarrhea, so it's gonna be, like, probably half an hour.

64
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,580
And I gotta fucking get up.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,080
And then I come back, and people link me a video that,

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
oh, my God, did you see what happened?

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,259
And it's like me without the glasses and a superhero outfit,

68
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:12,259
like, saving a bus full of children,

69
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:17,959
dressed up like a therapist.

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,959
I'm not gonna... This is loud, by the way.

71
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,959
I'm not gonna wear this.

72
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,959
This is just for you to take a screenshot,

73
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,389
because I can't put these on.

74
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,699
It just seems weird.

75
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:30,699
I feel like I have a VR headset on without the VR in front of me,

76
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:36,579
because there's no lenses in these.

77
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,579
You know how some people look, like, much better with glasses?

78
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:45,939
What's the reverse?

79
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:55,160
Please wear it? I don't think I can.

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
I've got that light back up here, too,

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,410
which is not gonna do me any favors.

82
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,540
It's a fucking wine mom.

83
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
And I've got two kinds of chapstick!

84
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,259
I really am fucking 40.

85
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:17,139
So, here's what we're gonna do.

86
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,689
I've almost got my cross-eyed.

87
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,629
Yeah, these are coming off. I'm not fucking wearing these.

88
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,500
Those are coming off.

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,319
So, I have a bunch of Itch.io games that I want to play.

90
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,319
Some of them are Christmas themes,

91
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,319
some of them are horror, some of them are fun,

92
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,319
some of them are weird,

93
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,560
and we're just gonna do a bunch of them.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
I don't know how long I'm gonna be here.

95
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,060
I don't know how long this is gonna take.

96
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,230
No idea. All I know is that I've got my wine here.

97
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,240
I've got my...oh, I'm gonna turn this on.

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,740
Gonna get toasty in here, I guarantee it.

99
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,740
Oh, let me move this.

100
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,040
Ah, turn on. Turn on!

101
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,050
Turn on! There we go.

102
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,459
Okay. Hold on, let me move this.

103
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,459
Let me move that.

104
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,939
Move this. Let me move that.

105
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,939
Move this.

106
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,939
I've got, like, an empty coffee mug here I want to get rid of as well.

107
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,939
All right.

108
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:26,740
I think I'm ready.

109
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
You just turned off the PC.

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,649
Hey, you know, hold on. I think I have to...

111
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,649
I think I have to be right back for a minute.

112
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,720
Yeah. Yeah, I think I got...

113
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Yeah, I gotta BRB for just a second, guys.

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,100
Yeah, BRB.

115
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Just one second. Just a minute or two.

116
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:59,480
Hahahaha! Merry Christmas!

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:06,579
Did you get one? Did you get your present?

118
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:09,529
I'm trying to make it around the clock.

119
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:18,939
I'm trying to get there.

120
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,939
There it is. I told you we were going to get one for winter

121
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:22,939
and one for Christmas.

122
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,370
Just in time for the holiday.

123
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,060
Got one of our new BRB screens

124
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:36,569
and I love it.

125
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,569
We're going to use this for, like, at least a week or two.

126
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,050
I don't even care if it's Christmas is over.

127
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:51,029
Do you see the characters in the background?

128
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,029
Can you count? Is that Grandpa? That is Grandpa down there.

129
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:58,860
Yeah, Blordow made this.

130
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
Got it done.

131
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,800
And out and ready.

132
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
We're just in time here.

133
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,420
So that's going to be the BRB screen

134
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,050
that you will see from now on

135
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,769
for the next week or two.

136
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,769
And now, we can actually start the stream.

137
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,199
I wanted to show that, though. I thought it was really cool.

138
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,300
Now, don't mind, like, the scary music

139
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,620
that's here now.

140
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,620
We're playing a scary game. It's called Santa's Cookies.

141
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,620
It's the first of the Ichio Night.

142
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,830
And I think we can begin.

143
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:44,679
I think we can begin.

144
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,679
That's a pretty good...

145
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,629
What year is it? What year is this?

146
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:55,429
Uh, last week.

147
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,990
2022.

148
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,299
Whatever it is.

149
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,980
It's a vintage!

150
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,480
I got it a week ago!

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Evil hair. I look evil today. Are you ready?

152
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh, but we want you to play horror games.

153
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
All right, well, the only time I'm going to play horror games right now

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
is if a lot of community subs are coming in, too.

155
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Holy shit, thank you, everybody.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
That's way too much.

157
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,720
Don't give me... Stop giving me money.

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I demand it. That's 100 community subs from Zixia.

159
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Merry Christmas. Stop giving me money.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,220
Don't give me any more. I'm going to be very upset with you.

161
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,519
I'm going to be very upset with you.

162
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,820
Don't give me any more money. I'll be very upset with you.

163
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,379
Is this thing in the right spot?

164
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,070
What's it look like without this? I don't know.

165
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,529
All right, here we go.

166
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,529
Are you guys ready to rock and roll for the Christmas Eve extravaganza Ichio extravaganza Wine Mom Night?

167
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:54,970
Let me drop this.

168
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:02,200
Should I do two headphones for this?

169
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I think my face cam's too big.

170
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, I was right.

171
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,460
Uh, Zixia, that's insane. 100 community subs.

172
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,460
So many community subs are coming in.

173
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,460
Don't give me any more money. Thank you.

174
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,460
But that's a huge amount. 20 from Animos.

175
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,950
40 from Animos.

176
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,129
Let's fucking go. Santa's Cookies.

177
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:29,460
Ready to rock and roll.

178
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:41,559
Turn it up. The game crashed.

179
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,559
Shit. That's my fault.

180
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:49,580
That's my fault. I fucked it up.

181
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
I'm ready for this one, though. I fucked it up. Hold on.

182
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:03,720
Try it again.

183
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Okay. Santa's Cookies.

184
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:17,269
Here we go. Merry Christmas, everybody.

185
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,269
Oh!

186
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,269
That's right. Voting for New Year's Eve.

187
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:23,269
Die!

188
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,289
Wait, what was he?

189
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,289
Get me! I didn't do anything.

190
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:35,450
What happened?

191
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,330
Um, voting for New Year's Eve.

192
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,820
I was...

193
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Dude, the OBS preview is over here

194
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
and I got jumpscared from it.

195
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,509
Um, okay.

196
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,690
New Year's Eve stuff.

197
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,690
The poll, the vote,

198
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,690
is almost ready.

199
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,690
It's gonna take a little bit longer.

200
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,690
I'm hoping

201
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,690
that after this stream is over,

202
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,690
later tonight, you will see on my Twitter,

203
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,690
boom, Survey Monkey. There it is.

204
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,690
If it's not there tonight,

205
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,250
and that'll be an early Christmas present

206
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,250
for you tomorrow morning.

207
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,250
So, it's going to be there within the next

208
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,940
12 hours. Guaranteed.

209
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,029
People still giving a ton of money?

210
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,029
Alright.

211
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,029
Stop giving me money. I'm serious.

212
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,659
Stop giving me money. Please stop giving me money.

213
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,659
Don't give me any more money.

214
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,659
I'm addressing you directly now.

215
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,659
Don't give me any more money. I don't want it.

216
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,860
Stop it. Alright. No, no, no.

217
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
I haven't drank this yet. Alright, let's go.

218
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,860
So, what happened?

219
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,870
So, I don't want to meet Santa.

220
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:50,279
Why do you open doors? What?

221
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:58,019
Who am I? Why am I this small?

222
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:06,279
Is he right outside?

223
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:16,779
What am I supposed to goal?

224
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:29,320
Okay. I don't see him.

225
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,100
What am I supposed to be doing?

226
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,399
Oh, I got milk.

227
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,159
Oh no, I don't have a glass. I think I have to fill this with milk.

228
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,159
Can I just put it in the sink?

229
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:45,159
It's your fucking mom and dad anyways. Who cares?

230
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,980
I'll just put it in the sink.

231
00:13:47,980 --> 00:14:07,740
Can I hide in here?

232
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Why did I get jumped on so quickly last time?

233
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Where's our house?

234
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:23,940
Oh shit, there he is.

235
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,210
Where's his hat? Oh shit, close the door.

236
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,639
Where do I go? What should I do?

237
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,639
This is not even Santa. This is just dad walking around.

238
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:39,379
Where's his hat?

239
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,019
I'd wear.

240
00:14:43,019 --> 00:15:10,710
Can I go under the bed? There's a sprint.

241
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,169
I don't see him down here. Oh, milk.

242
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:21,399
Residents, hold on. There's milk, milk, milk, milk.

243
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,850
Put it down.

244
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,850
Alright, I got the milk on the table. Oh my fucking god, there he is.

245
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:36,299
Where do I go? Where do I go?

246
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,240
He's going back up the stairs. I think I'm okay.

247
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:47,620
So I have to put the cookies up there too?

248
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:58,379
Oh, there's a cookie. Oh shit, I think I missed.

249
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:12,009
I hope Santa didn't have any

250
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,009
pep and mocha coffees this morning like me.

251
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:24,379
I think I'm alright.

252
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,379
I think I probably leave now.

253
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:47,480
It plays the music when he's there.

254
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Where are the other cookies?

255
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Relax, holy shit, dude. Are you kidding me?

256
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,360
This is not even scary.

257
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Did I just fake that? No, I really didn't. I swear to god.

258
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
But that was way over- I haven't played scary games in a long time.

259
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,779
It's been a very long time.

260
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,779
That was way over-acting.

261
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:07,269
I gotta go back to acting school.

262
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,269
You guys think it's gonna be funny that in 10 years

263
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,269
when actors

264
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,269
don't even want to be actors anymore, they just want to be streamers?

265
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:15,960
There will be workshops

266
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
on how to react to

267
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,700
a jump scare.

268
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,539
I could teach that class. Alright, that was Santa's cookies.

269
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:34,650
It was pretty good.

270
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,650
We're gonna stay in this same realm

271
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,650
I think. We might as well

272
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,079
get them out of the way.

273
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,079
This one's called The Christmas Incident.

274
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:54,970
Find out.

275
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,970
Return of Scare Saturdays? Well, I mean, I just

276
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,589
feel like it'd be fun.

277
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,589
Christmas Incident. This one looks weird.

278
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,369
All these games were got on

279
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:09,210
ICHIO, by the way.

280
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:19,450
I think I'm gonna have to capture my monitor.

281
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:28,390
Alright, this is called The Christmas Incident.

282
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,390
I'm gonna turn this way fucking down.

283
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,390
Alright, 20 should be alright. Play.

284
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:40,250
Turn it up. Have you met Santa?

285
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,859
Okay, we gotta-

286
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,859
Can I get the sensitivity menu back?

287
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,849
This is way too low.

288
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:53,849
Every game has

289
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,849
wicked shit sensitivity, though.

290
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,220
Hold on, I gotta fix this. This is not gonna happen

291
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,779
the way that it is right now. Looking for a game

292
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,779
to capture. Well, there isn't one, so just wait.

293
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:13,640
Fucking didn't even

294
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
do the sensitivity, goddammit!

295
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,140
Every game that's ever released

296
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,339
ever, always

297
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:26,339
have the mouse sensitivity

298
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,339
you have to do 0

299
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,339
to 10 or nothing at all.

300
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,339
Like, anything over 10 is

301
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,160
unusable. I'll get it this time.

302
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,349
Call it. I'm gonna keep it at

303
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:45,130
50. Christmas- The Christmas

304
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,130
Miracle. That's better. Alright.

305
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,130
Can we give like an actual clap to this

306
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,819
dev, whoever you are?

307
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:53,819
You are better than every single AAA

308
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,819
studio that makes mouse

309
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,529
sensitivity awful. Alright, so let's go.

310
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:07,019
This is kinda creepy. Both

311
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,319
headphones in, I know I'm cheating. Have you

312
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,710
met Santa? Yeah, I've met him.

313
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:25,940
Maybe once or twice.

314
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,640
Pick up the flashlight. Okay.

315
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,059
There's no FOV slider.

316
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,009
What the hell is going on? You hear that?

317
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:49,670
It's creepy. Okay, I got a

318
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,670
game coming up that I'm really not looking forward to playing.

319
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,099
There's a game that I'm gonna play

320
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,279
in a little bit that is

321
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,279
considered one of the scariest, most

322
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:00,279
unbearable Itch.io experiences.

323
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,279
It's by that Puppet, um

324
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,289
Puppet combo?

325
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,460
It looks so

326
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,640
ugh. I'm not

327
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
fucking ready. It looks so horrible.

328
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I don't know if I wanna do it.

329
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,289
But this low poly shit is way

330
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,289
scarier than like a hundred

331
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:21,289
zombies running at you in Resident Evil.

332
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,289
They gotta go back to this stuff. They really do.

333
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:28,789
It's just so unsettling. Enter house,

334
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:39,269
press E. Hold on.

335
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,269
It like looks like 3D movie maker, which makes it

336
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:47,990
worse. What am I looking for?

337
00:21:47,990 --> 00:22:02,259
Just investigate? There are people talking.

338
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,859
Can you hear them? There are people eating

339
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:12,039
dinner. Where are the people?

340
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:22,470
What radio station just plays the

341
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,470
inside of a restaurant on a Thursday night?

342
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:43,450
I don't know. Okay.

343
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,539
BP. Can I turn the flashlight off?

344
00:22:47,539 --> 00:23:06,019
Nothing in here. Oh, there is something in here.

345
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:21,960
There's a bloody knife. Now over here?

346
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,660
Wait. Yeah. This is where I came in.

347
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Do I need to pick up any candy? Is this an elevator?

348
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Why would you have it? Why is there an elevator?

349
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:43,160
Are you painting on the toilet? Oh, I thought that was

350
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
an easel. I was like

351
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
doing like a fucking piece of artwork while he

352
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,450
was taking a shit. Why is there

353
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:58,039
a mirror in here?

354
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,039
That's so weird. Can you

355
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,039
imagine just like squatting down here and

356
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,220
just like on your phone and just going

357
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:08,630
like this? That would be so

358
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:19,509
weird looking. What do you mean squatting?

359
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:22,650
How do you go to the bathroom?

360
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,589
What are you talking about? You squat down to take

361
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,960
a shit. How do you go to the bathroom? What are you talking about?

362
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,099
You stand on the toilet seat?

363
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:33,980
Sit. Yeah, squat, sit.

364
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
Like, you'd be

365
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,980
like, you know what I mean? Squat.

366
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,410
Take half a squat. What happened to my pop

367
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,220
stand? What the fuck is going on? You squat.

368
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:56,920
That looks fucking weird.

369
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:06,069
I'm not going to drink that way. Do I have

370
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:11,380
any backstory here? It's a horror

371
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,380
game, guys. Where's the notes that are

372
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
everywhere with like three pages of exposition?

373
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,740
Where's the open diary

374
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,740
with like fucking four pages of what happened

375
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,059
yesterday? This is what? You think this is a horror

376
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,029
game? Ooh, a big key.

377
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:37,980
I like this. I

378
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,470
love, I don't know. I think it's so cool

379
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,900
that over the last like ten years or so

380
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
that we've been able to have indie devs have been able

381
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,460
to just make whatever the fuck they want. It's really cool.

382
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,740
Is there a sprint? There is not a sprint.

383
00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:01,160
I got a key though. Was there a locked door?

384
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:12,789
Oh shit. Oh,

385
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,789
there is a present waiting for you

386
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:22,279
under the Christmas tree. Is that Iron

387
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,029
Maiden? Why are they just like the

388
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:27,029
Olympic fucking rings? What?

389
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,859
What are these? There's a present waiting for you

390
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,859
under the tree. Alright, there's a person lying here.

391
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:57,349
Okay. I'm like unsettled right

392
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,349
now. Go get the present.

393
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:12,089
That's the wrong way. Oh shit. Okay, I thought

394
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:17,660
that was a hallway that went this way. It'd be so

395
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,660
funny to the killer. Like to the killer though.

396
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Like you run that way

397
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
and you stop and you go, oops, sorry, nevermind.

398
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,890
What am I supposed to do?

399
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:36,740
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,

400
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

401
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,829
Mokaish! Tree's downstairs.

402
00:27:45,829 --> 00:28:03,990
Isn't the tree over here?

403
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,990
Alright, he's not just hiding back there, right?

404
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,430
Go get your present under the tree.

405
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,430
He's gonna just grab me and scream in my face.

406
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,059
I know it. Where's my present?

407
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:21,940
You forgot to put your eyelashes on.

408
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:34,279
Oh, I forgot something.

409
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:50,329
Is he running? Stop making

410
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,329
the fucking noise. Where is he?

411
00:28:52,329 --> 00:29:04,150
The front door? Is he upstairs?

412
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:35,940
This is different. Oh, no.

413
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:48,859
I'm gonna get lost. I'm gonna get lost in here. Does that sound startle the witch?

414
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,220
Oh, I don't like- I hate this shit so much.

415
00:29:51,220 --> 00:30:02,670
Why do I- like, you know, can I tell you something?

416
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,390
I need to talk about this for a sec before I get scared.

417
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,980
What the fuck is wrong with humans?

418
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,190
The lengths we go to to entertain ourselves and like stimulate our brains.

419
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,240
What the hell am I doing here? Why are we doing this?

420
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:27,859
Humanity goes so far to desperately try to stimulate our brains to a point where we like pretend

421
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:32,640
we're locked in a murderer's house and there's blood everywhere and we're gonna get fucking killed.

422
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:42,920
Guys, even just the notion of the firework is enough to be like, what are we doing?

423
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,000
Oh, yeah, I mean, I got an idea. Let's just make explode stuff.

424
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,950
Like, just make huge explosions in front of everybody. Like, why? Why are we doing this? You're high already.

425
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:14,589
What happened? What the fuck was that? I didn't do that. Why did my light just do that?

426
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,869
Why did the lights just go out? I'm not- am I- look at my hands.

427
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,910
Why did the lights just turn off? Why did the lights just turn off?

428
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:41,500
That was scarier than the game. Is the house haunted?

429
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:47,190
Did somebody hack my computer and like hack my house and turn my lights off in my house?

430
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:57,130
I feel like that was somebody here. 32-bit holiday jam 2021. Good work. That was fun.

431
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:09,819
Special thanks to the Unity Asset Store. Good shit. That was fun. It's quick. It was fun. It was weird.

432
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:18,309
I like it. It was good. Christmas incident. I love the low poly. I think it's fantastic.

433
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:24,799
You look genuinely concerned. Bro, the lights just turned off in my room and I didn't fucking

434
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,970
click switch. That wasn't a routine. I didn't- that wasn't a bit I did.

435
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:36,509
Alright, let's keep going. Moving on. I think there's one more like this that I want to do.

436
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:45,680
We've got- okay, I gotta make sure I remember which ones we did. That was the Christmas incident.

437
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:54,980
We did Santa's cookies. The next one coming up is sleigh bells. Sleigh bells.

438
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:14,289
Hopefully it's not loud. Careful. Stop breaking my immersion OBS.

439
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:29,549
Another low poly one we got here. Sleigh bells. Why is everyone saying yes? Why am I wearing- what

440
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:41,710
did you say? Why are you wearing a 2013 turkey evil eye bath towel? That's so weirdly specific.

441
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:46,900
I have no idea what you're even talking about. It's a nice sweater. I think it looks good.

442
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,819
It's not an ugly Christmas sweater. This is a beautiful Christmas sweater.

443
00:33:53,339 --> 00:34:17,539
And I've got the game. I've got the game on. Yes, sleigh. You did this. Merry Christmas everybody.

444
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,829
You know, it's been kind of a fucked up year or two. It's been kind of stressful for everybody,

445
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:33,179
I think. But, uh, let's hope we- we keep going. All we can do is move forward. And that's it. Okay.

446
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:44,940
I'm ready. Press any key. You got it. Click here to watch the making of this game. Sleigh bells.

447
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:55,730
Who made this game? By Blake McKinnon. Additional sound effects by Brianna McKinnon.

448
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,519
Move WASD, sprint to shift, attack. There's an attack. Left click, zoom, right click,

449
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:09,659
F, E, and Q. All right, let's go. Christmas Eve and I'm still taking my clothes off in this

450
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:14,960
horrible town for money. Sigh, I better deliver Billy's Christmas present before it gets too late.

451
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,719
I wonder if he even remembers what I look like. He hasn't seen me for months. Not since he went

452
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:31,710
to live with his father. Why'd they have to take him from me? I miss my little Billy. Okay. Toggle

453
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:52,500
your flashlight. I like the music. I'm gonna go this way. There's a stamina meter. You know when

454
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,119
you put lip balm on and then your skin starts peeling off on your lips? What's up with that?

455
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:10,190
Our objective. Deliver Billy's present. This is zoom. Okay. I thought they were just gonna

456
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:16,000
fucking crash. Oh, I was gonna get, I didn't get it because it was, the file was so huge

457
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,500
for like a two second joke. I was gonna hit gone home, but you're a car. It was making me laugh.

458
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:42,380
I like this. But imagine if I played that. Okay. Are you Billy? Where's Billy? Where's my house?

459
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:59,019
Who are these people? Oh, snowman. That's a pretty damn good snowman. I gotta tell you.

460
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:05,070
The hair in my wine. Okay. I almost drank it. I don't care. It doesn't matter. You guys know

461
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:13,760
you eat over an inch of dirt every single meal. You know that? You eat over an inch of dirt every

462
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:24,880
single meal. Weird. Every time you've ever eaten, you're always eating over an inch of dirt because

463
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,280
you're at least about a foot off the ground at the dinner table, aren't you? Use that joke at

464
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,739
Christmas. Your family will laugh. I guarantee it. You're always eating at least an inch over

465
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,880
of dirt, at least. You know what I mean? At least you eat over an inch of dirt means you at least

466
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:52,420
eat over the inch of dirt. Get it? You guys don't get it. Or bet somebody to bar a hundred dollars

467
00:37:52,420 --> 00:38:04,219
at. You'll win. Oh, deliver. I think this is it. Okay. I'll just leave the present here. I doubt

468
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:07,900
they'll want to see me right now. I better get home or it gets too late. I don't want to be out

469
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:22,619
after midnight. You minus twoing that? I just made everybody here a hundred dollars. You're not gonna

470
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,579
minus two when somebody has to pay you a hundred dollars because you proved to them that you eat

471
00:38:25,579 --> 00:38:41,460
over an inch of dirt every meal. People fucking money. Whatever. Fine. All right. Merry Christmas,

472
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:55,760
Billy. I better get home. Chat is pissed. They'll get over it. I've made worse jokes. If you're new

473
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:06,719
here, don't worry. In fact, eventually here over the next 12 hours or so, you'll be able to vote

474
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:15,630
for what your favorite worst joke was last year. You've been on my Twitter. Worst joke of the year

475
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:39,300
is a category. Do I have an objective on the map? Make your way home. Okay. Where do I live? Where

476
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:58,400
do I live? What if I don't know where I live? Subway. This is blocked off for some reason.

477
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,349
I wonder what's going on up here. I won't be getting home this way. I'll have to go through

478
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:20,079
the subway tunnel. It's not that much further. I'm going to get fucked up today, by the way.

479
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:41,699
Just want to make sure everyone knows. All right. Go through the subway. Easy. All right. Here we go.

480
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:47,869
I got to go home through the subway. I got to walk the whole subway train line thing. It's allowed

481
00:40:47,869 --> 00:41:06,860
to, is it all right? Aunt Sausage. Cat and the Mouse Experiment. Blake McKinnon film. Is this

482
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:15,570
guy, is this guy made like a horror movie? All right, Blake, let's see what you got. Let's see

483
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:28,110
what you got. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you too. I just licked my lips because I'm a lip

484
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,429
licker. I just can't stop. And I just tasted soap because I've been putting, I'm trying to do this,

485
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:43,489
man. I just, I gotta stop doing it. I'm such a, I'm a lizard. I swear to God. I, I'm so aware of it

486
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:52,449
too. It sucks. He's been disemboweled. What sort of maniac would do such a thing? I better get out

487
00:41:52,449 --> 00:42:02,139
of here before whoever did this comes back. Get out of the subway? Oh, there's a lot of ads for

488
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:10,909
this guy's movie. There are more ads for this guy's YouTube horror movie than Spider-Man No Way Home.

489
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:18,800
Advertiser budget is probably pretty high for this one. It's loud as fuck. Is it all right?

490
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:36,619
Where should I go? Wait. I don't think I should go that way. Why is that even scary? Like, I mean,

491
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:44,980
it's weird that there's a, but like if I saw Santa, I'd be like, oh, safe. Santa will protect me from

492
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:57,789
the fucking scary monster that's here. I wouldn't be scared of Santa. All right. Do I have to run?

493
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:09,460
Why the fuck did you get over there? What happened? What are you talking about?

494
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:23,619
What? I wouldn't be scared of Santa. I would hope Santa would be the one protecting us.

495
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:30,480
If Santa's the one with the axe, we've got a lot of problems. We've got way more problems than we

496
00:43:30,480 --> 00:44:01,219
think. Okay. So what am I supposed to do? Just run away? So what the fuck, man? Do I go buy him?

497
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:21,380
Oh shit. It's always a bathroom punch. What if I just punch him in the face?

498
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,539
I'm tell- I honestly think this. If like an old man was coming at me with a big axe,

499
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:32,130
I would just snap his neck and win. They have to swing the- an axe is not a great weapon.

500
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:48,110
All right. I'm dead. I don't think I wouldn't be afraid of an axe. I really wouldn't. An axe has

501
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,789
this like one point. It's heavy. You have to swing it. I would be able to dodge it and I would just

502
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:56,750
go dodge underneath them and grab him by his chin here and his top of his head here. And I would

503
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:09,710
snap his neck. It would be easy. Axes are not good weapons. Seriously. So, okay. I got to follow the

504
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:22,099
arrow somebody said. What the fuck? Ah, see what I'm talking about? This guy can't even hit me.

505
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:48,059
Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Get out of the subway. Get out of the

506
00:45:48,059 --> 00:46:16,860
subway. Get out of the subway. Whoa. Holy shit. Look at that. Whoa. What the fuck? That's so cool.

507
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:26,139
I didn't know you could do that. I need a crowbar to get out of the subway. Where the fuck is the

508
00:46:26,139 --> 00:46:57,409
crowbar? I need a crowbar to get out of the subway. Bathroom? I knew you were gonna go right.

509
00:46:57,409 --> 00:47:09,579
Where is the crowbar? It has to be the bathroom. Oh, down here? What the fuck? He's killing

510
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:31,869
policemen. Crowbar? I don't see a crowbar. Oh, fuck it. Out of here, dude. Where is the crowbar?

511
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:43,460
Can I hide? I have no idea where I am right now. I'm just going in circles. He's on the map. No,

512
00:47:43,460 --> 00:48:08,909
he's not. What the hell is going on? Crowbar? Crowbar? Crowbar? You! How do I get the fuck out

513
00:48:08,909 --> 00:48:19,139
of here? Oh my god, dude. Give me a break. Come on. I don't even know where I- I don't even know

514
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:45,230
where that was. Is there a crouch? I gotta hop. Okay, I gotta go right? I don't want him to see me.

515
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:52,699
Don't- okay. He'll walk by and I can go around. I'm high as fuck right now. As long as that's

516
00:48:52,699 --> 00:49:02,269
legal in your jurisdiction and you're responsible about it and I'm okay with it. This is too loud.

517
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm turning it down. Fuck it. If I can go around and hide. You- oh, yeah. Pre-fire.

518
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:23,260
Ban this person from the lobby, seriously. Oh, you piece of shit. Give me a break.

519
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:30,820
I remember it's down here. I gotta- okay. Lock this in long-term memory, please, Jeremy.

520
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:43,260
Here, I see blood. It's literally right. No, it's left. You stupid motherfucker.

521
00:49:43,260 --> 00:50:02,260
I'm gonna get through this. It's the stamina that's killing me. It's right. So you go right,

522
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,969
straight. Alright, I'll get it. And then I gotta get to the exit, too.

523
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:35,659
The flashlight? I'm gonna flash that off. Okay, down, right. He doesn't know where I am. Right?

524
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:51,420
I don't know where I am. Where am I? Ah! Okay, I don't- I forget everything.

525
00:50:51,420 --> 00:51:12,369
Fuck you! Give me a break. What? Right here? Where am I supposed to go?

526
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:24,320
And then I gotta go down here and leave the subway. Don't turn- I'm not gonna turn around.

527
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:41,179
No way. This looks like a Roblox mod. It's low poly. Just give me a checkpoint, please.

528
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:49,199
Oh shit, my light. My light- hold on a second. Whoa! I can't- if the game's paused,

529
00:51:49,199 --> 00:52:13,730
he can't hurt me, right? My light's fucked up. I'm trying to be professional for once in my god

530
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:36,769
damn life. Alright, now what? Find your way home. It's very quiet all of a sudden. I wonder where

531
00:52:36,769 --> 00:53:12,130
everyone has gone. A gulp. The weather outside is bright. I got fire and solar light. Since we-

532
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:22,849
since we no place- hold on. Since we no place- I'll get it. Since we no place to go. Let it snow,

533
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:34,619
let it snow, let it snow. Use that part. Like, three people just got banned. I don't know what

534
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:57,440
you did, but what the fuck are you doing? Oh, why do they have to keep locking this gate? Oh,

535
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,860
that's not Santa talking. I thought it said Santa. Looks like damage- can I break it?

536
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:15,119
How would you not be able to break it with a crowbar? Why could you not break it with a crowbar?

537
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,199
I don't even have a crowbar anymore. Why the game take- the game took the crowbar from me.

538
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:34,420
Are you kidding me? The flashlight. It coughs. There's a crazy guy running around with an axe.

539
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:39,980
He's- but he's- I think he's literally 15 feet behind me. He's gonna kill me.

540
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:52,590
Oh, I should go file a police report. He's- he's literally fucking 30 feet behind me. He's even

541
00:54:52,590 --> 00:55:00,179
an axe. He's gonna kill me. Go- go to the station tomorrow morning. Okay. Just to tomorrow morning?

542
00:55:00,179 --> 00:55:15,920
Okay. Okay, thank- all right, thank you. So, I need to find a weapon.

543
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:33,840
Politic Landy. I'm well lit for that one. Fuck you. I need to find something that breaks this.

544
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:44,210
Can I just punch it with my hands? How am I supposed to find something that breaks through

545
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:56,739
a wall? I had a crowbar in my freaking hand. Go home. What do you think I'm trying to do?

546
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:05,570
And how dare you talk like that to the streamer? Number one rule is respect the streamer always.

547
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:13,869
How dare you? I- I don't want to activate this yet. There's gotta be like a weapon or something

548
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:18,900
I can find. Something to break the door. I don't want to turn that cutscene on because then he

549
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:29,199
starts chasing after me. Hold on. Uh, it might show up on the minimap. Can I write your obituary in

550
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:37,139
advance? Ban that person for an hour. I think I have to do this first. Okay, now it's like,

551
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:50,420
oh, I can't get through here. Where is he? Where is he then? All right, does it- is it gonna show

552
00:56:50,420 --> 00:57:03,360
up in the minimap? Something I can break? He just fucking hit me in the back. Oh, I'm so dead.

553
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:15,199
All right, I gotta find this, whatever this is first. Find something to break the door down,

554
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:21,840
but I wait, I don't know where to look. Blue dot on the map? It was only a yellow dot on the map,

555
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:43,809
though. I looked. Sneak around if- okay, turn the flashlight off. What can I find here? Go through

556
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:52,480
the window? Yeah, I'm not activating his spawn point here. Not yet. What about can I jump up on

557
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:02,980
stuff? Go through the window. You saw a window? It was a blue one just as you died. Really, was

558
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,889
there? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, I'm going, I'm going. So I gotta run

559
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:28,960
this way. All right, go. Blue dot on the minimap. Oh shit, I see it. Oh bro, I got an axe now too.

560
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:44,429
You're fucked. I know what that is now. All right, I got it, I got it, I got it. You suck.

561
00:58:44,429 --> 00:59:04,510
I don't. This game's hard. Blanker. All right, there it is, right there. I see the blue dot.

562
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:10,500
So get the axe first and then I'm going for it. Do two hits and you're out? Yeah, well, I, it's,

563
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:20,219
it's kind of tricky. So let me go get that first. That was what, down here? Yeah, right here.

564
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:30,579
So I got the axe. Now I shouldn't spawn him. I don't think he's gonna spawn unless I get over

565
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:38,849
there. I mean, you just hurt my feelings. I'm just kidding him. I'm just messing around. All right,

566
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:57,949
let's go. Find your way home. Oh shit, I live here. What? An eviction notice? They must have

567
00:59:57,949 --> 01:00:02,989
changed the lock too. What? I need to get out of here before Santa finds me. The only way out of

568
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:21,699
here is along the train tracks. I turn the flashlight off. Get myself killed here. Can I

569
01:00:21,699 --> 01:00:38,980
break this? Where is this motherfucker? I know he's here somewhere. Stairs onto the, wait,

570
01:00:38,980 --> 01:01:02,130
the stairs. Go upstairs. I go. Where are the stairs? Stairs? Where are they? Where are they?

571
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:16,050
Where are the stairs? Where are the stairs? I don't see them. I got here late. What was

572
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:40,900
your Christmas gift? Is there a staircase up here that I didn't see? Where is it? Huh? Oh,

573
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:57,170
there I go. I just needed my glasses. I just needed my glasses. He's gonna be on the road here.

574
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:27,070
Wait, you know what I mean. That was one of my eye. My eye is burning. Two headphones going in.

575
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:34,659
Fuck it. I'm going real mode. For all the new viewers, I don't wear headphones. I only wear

576
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:40,260
one earbud because I'm like a baby and like I get sensory overload and I can't think and I can't

577
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:46,719
talk when there's sound going into both ears. So I have to do it like this. Otherwise I can't talk.

578
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:55,360
I swear to God that's not made up bullshit. It's real. See right now I'm like, I'm hitting a wall

579
01:02:55,360 --> 01:03:03,820
of talking. I can't do it. I hate it. I need to be aware of my surroundings and I need to

580
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:13,630
hear my surroundings. I would rather there be mono audio coming through here and stereo coming

581
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:19,070
through here and I don't get to hear the left side. It sucks. All right. I got to pay attention.

582
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:29,699
This is important. What's all the stuff on the mini map? What's the green? There's a green thing

583
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:49,440
on the mini map. Oh, crowbar. Why would I get a, it's a gun. Gun. I have a gun. This guy's fucked.

584
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:56,190
Eight shots. All right. There's a crowbar. I think this is the final battle. This seems pretty final

585
01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:01,500
battle-ish to me if I'm serious. What if I shoot him in the head? Does he just die?

586
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:19,019
Escape via the train tracks. Okay. See the gun. Why would I take an axe when I gotta get a gun?

587
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:40,110
16 shots. This guy is dead. What does he want me to go out here? Objective. Kill Santa. It is.

588
01:04:40,110 --> 01:05:06,239
He's dead. Just give me a whatever. I'm just going to run around. I didn't, I didn't know

589
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,750
I had to shoot him that many times. Just a guy with an axe. If you shoot somebody in the head

590
01:05:10,750 --> 01:06:03,099
with an axe, this is going to drop ammo. Let's go. Oh, your AI is fucking stupid. I win. Oh,

591
01:06:03,099 --> 01:07:07,489
I don't have any bullets left. Fuck you. I need stamina. I can't run from him. I need stamina.

592
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:29,570
He's an idiot. He's an idiot. He's an idiot. Okay. I got time. Green dot is ammo. No, it's not. Shut

593
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:46,219
up. Is it really? Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Where is he? What do I do

594
01:07:46,219 --> 01:08:23,920
with the gun? What do I do with the gun? All right. He's dead. All right. He's dead. I'm going to,

595
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:31,229
I win. Poop face. That would be a really bad poop face. I feel like you'd want to go to the

596
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:39,100
doctor immediately. Give me the gun. All right. I got it. It's easy. I don't, I feel like the game

597
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:51,250
will fuck up if I pick that up. It's ammo. All right. So because the green, I thought the green

598
01:08:51,250 --> 01:09:00,819
was the plant. 16. Let's get it all. You probably have to hit him every single time though. It's

599
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:12,460
probably like 30 shots. I thought it was something in the plant. I don't know. All right. I have 24

600
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:22,479
bullets. Garbage day. That's an old meme. All right. Let's do it. 24 shots. I'm not going to

601
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,500
shoot him yet. I'm going to get them onto the tracks and walk them backwards. Here we go.

602
01:09:29,060 --> 01:10:16,000
Get the stamina up. Ready boys and girls. Oh, he's dead. He's dead. Oops. I thought he was,

603
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:57,630
I'm an idiot. I fucking missed. Oh my God. I'm going to blow the whole thing. Eat shit, Santa.

604
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:20,340
You killed Santa. Merry Christmas. I like that one. That was fun. That was fun. That was good.

605
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:35,199
That was good. That was good. That was fun. Do it again? Why would I do it again? All right.

606
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:43,970
Moving on. Coming up next. I need to make sure I got to keep track of these. Any more Christmas

607
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:58,340
ones? I think that's all the Christmas ones. I got to pee. Anybody else have to pee? Go pee.

608
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:03,140
We'll be right back. Pee break. Quick. And I kind of want to just put the BRB on. You know what I

609
01:12:03,140 --> 01:14:43,949
mean? I just like the BRB. All right. Two minutes. Be right back. Okay. God, I love this. It's so

610
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:56,739
cute. Go support Blordow. For the love of God, please. He's got a band camp. I'm not even here

611
01:14:56,739 --> 01:15:05,470
right now. Right? Like the thing you're hearing and the thing you are seeing is literally all

612
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:19,340
Blordow. It's his music and it's his art and animations. So go support Blordow. All right.

613
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:26,340
We're going to stay in the... I've actually seen this game played. So I can't tell you it's going

614
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:30,260
to be like a completely... Oh, I've never seen it before. But I feel like it looked like fun. I

615
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:36,510
didn't watch very much of it. We're going to play Knight of the Consumers. It's a game where you

616
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:43,090
have to like stock shelves or something. It's kind of scary. I don't know. I've seen it for like maybe

617
01:15:43,090 --> 01:16:03,789
15 minutes of it so far. Looks like fun. And here we go. Coming back. Let me get this over here.

618
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:12,060
Open it up. Should see it very momentarily here. I put it on ultra graphics. Does that even matter?

619
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:29,460
I'm not sure that even matters. Warning. This game contains... Hold on. Warning. This game contains a

620
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:41,010
real retail experience. Knight of the Consumers. You don't stream in 1080. What's the point? Bit

621
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:56,510
rate. 1080. Not worth it. 60 FPS. Awful. Looks awful. You need at least 10 to 20,000 bit rate

622
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:05,359
to make 1080 look okay at 60. How many times do I have to tell you this? All right. What are the

623
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:18,619
controls? How do I play? I have no idea how to play. I have no clue. How do you do that?

624
01:17:18,619 --> 01:17:41,460
Lots of lonely nights in the mirror. All right. Here we go. Hey, you're late. I just fell down.

625
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:47,659
You're late. But hey, since you're new around here, I'll cut you some slack.

626
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,939
My name is the manager. We're not too busy on days like these so you can have a nice easy shift to

627
01:17:55,939 --> 01:18:04,050
help you get settled in. Remember, I got a reputation to uphold here. You won't have me

628
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:10,739
looking like a fool in front of the other manager, would you? The store is the best in town and I

629
01:18:10,739 --> 01:18:16,689
would like to keep it that way. If any of my local customers aren't satisfied with your service,

630
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:23,680
I will be hearing about it. Now, go find Jimmy. He's been working here for a while now. Very loyal

631
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:44,180
employee. He'll show you the ropes. Put your stuff in the locker and get to it. Stuff in the locker.

632
01:18:44,180 --> 01:19:09,649
All right. Where is... I don't remember that. You all right, Jimmy? I can't take this anymore.

633
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:16,260
I don't get paid enough for this. The rude customers. The endless amounts of sick

634
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:27,170
shit stains. I've reached my breaking point. Listen up. It's up to you now. There's still a

635
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:32,380
lot of empty shelves out there. They need to be stacked before we close. You don't want to upset

636
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:37,789
manager. Here, take this. It's all the notes I've made while working here. Those tips saved me time

637
01:19:37,789 --> 01:19:50,220
and time again. All right. All right. I got notes. Hold shift is run. Left mouse is throw box. It

638
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:57,569
stuns them. Right mouse is drop box. When you're stacking a shelf, AD to look around. Hide in the

639
01:19:57,569 --> 01:20:18,399
staff room. Don't get caught. Okay. The sprint kitchen. All right. Okay. You got to... All right.

640
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,310
What I've seen of this game is you got to make sure that you know where the places are. That's

641
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:32,800
all I remember. So we got kitchen furniture. All right. Kitchen's over here. So where is it? Right

642
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:58,609
here. So you hit space. Okay. You all got any of those P.T. clone games? I can't get enough of

643
01:20:58,609 --> 01:21:09,869
them. Oh, I have to bring them to the right place. Toys. Video games. Right. Okay. I got to bring

644
01:21:09,869 --> 01:21:15,789
them to the section, but don't get caught. Fucking same person. What are you doing? You got anything

647
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:57,710
Where's video games? Where the hell is the coffee? Don't get between me and my caffeine.

Home cleaning. Pharmacy. Health and beauty. Alcohol. Drink. It's drink. Drink. Drink. Drink.

Unsettling shit. Okay. I have video games. I fucking just talked to you. Leave me alone, you dick.

650
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:21,340
Get away from me. Your most expensive bottle of champagne and none of the cheap stuff.

651
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:31,869
Where's alcohol? Drinks. Alcohol. All right. All right. All right. All right. Leave me alone.

I can run away. I need to use that way more often. All right. Pharmacy is right there.

655
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:35,359
Do I have to act? Do I have to stack? Throw the box? Oh shit. Okay. It hurts him. What the

656
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:56,100
fuck just happened? Put it up there, you fucking idiot. Okay. I'm hiding. Rude. I'm talking about

665
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:30,720

Don't fuck up my Christmas. By the way, you showed up at 1130. I said lunch was at 1115.

671
01:26:47,199 --> 01:27:00,189
We had to wait for you, Sean. And the quiche got a little bit cold, didn't it?

672

You fucking dumb motherfucker. I swear to God. What's wrong with you? Video games.

686
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:10,670
I can't read the latest game reviews. Magazines. Magazines. Magazines. Magazines.

Shit, okay. I got a headache. FIRE RIZZING!

700
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:57,869
I need another box.

701
01:34:57,869 --> 01:35:00,939
Yeah, I don't like it's the same people can attack you.

702
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:06,430
What happened? WHAT THE F- WHAT?

01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:07,430
FIRE!

704
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:11,739
Why did I get fired?

705
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:18,189
What? I took too long?

706
01:35:18,189 --> 01:35:22,670
What are you- what?

707
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,670
How do I- what do I have to do?

708
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:28,060
I rented a time.

709
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:35,739
Video games.

710
01:35:35,739 --> 01:35:37,739
Oh, the bottom right, it actually is a timer.

711
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:44,000
My mom thinks you're hot.

712
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Hello, Mr. Stevenson.

713
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
My name's Drew, I'm a 985.

714
01:35:48,000 --> 01:36:03,539
I'm an E-Clown. And I'm takin'.

Other side. Sweets.

720
01:36:40,189 --> 01:36:42,189
Alcohol's all the way at the end. Remember that, please.

721

Pharmacy. Get out of my way.

722
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:47,779
EXCUSE ME!

723
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:52,319
If I'm on- I gotta go fast-

724
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:54,619
I'm on a timer.

725
01:36:54,619 --> 01:36:56,859
I have to go really fast if I'm on a timer.

726
01:36:56,859 --> 01:36:58,859
Where's pharmacy, you piece of shit?

727
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:19,840
Other side.

728
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,539
Hey! Drinks.

729
01:37:23,539 --> 01:37:25,539

Yay!

731
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:36,479
The rodent?

732
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:38,479
I need a replacement sofa- oh, furniture, furniture, furniture.

733
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:51,729
Drinks.

734
01:37:51,729 --> 01:37:53,729
Come on, come on, come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

735
01:37:53,729 --> 01:38:06,899
Hurry up!

01:38:06,899 --> 01:38:08,899
EXCUSE ME!

737
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:12,220
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

738
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:20,539
Who the fuck is this baby?

739
01:38:20,539 --> 01:38:33,409
Baby!

740
01:38:33,409 --> 01:38:35,409
FIRE!

741
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:42,640
You're fired!

742
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:45,840
Vince McMahon.

743
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:55,550
Okay, one more.

744
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:57,550
Can I just put them down? Hold on, wait a minute.

745
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:00,239
The day hasn't started yet.

746
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:03,060
This is the tutorial.

747
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:06,699
Can you hit the manager with a box?

748
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:08,699
Alright, what if I get them in the right spot?

749
01:39:08,699 --> 01:39:16,369
Can I do that? I can.

750
01:39:16,369 --> 01:39:19,489
Yes, you can.

751
01:39:19,489 --> 01:39:22,939
Alright, let me try that. That's what you're supposed to do.

752
01:39:22,939 --> 01:39:25,630
How am I supposed to know that?

753
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:28,260
I've literally watched somebody play this game for five minutes.

754
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:33,119
Okay, pet food is right here.

755
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:35,119
Drop the box in the aisle before the day- okay.

756
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:39,340
Are you actually taking?

757
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:56,029
Alright, let's go.

758
01:39:56,029 --> 01:40:10,689
Video games are over here.

759
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:13,819
He's cheating on us.

760
01:40:13,819 --> 01:40:21,060
He's got two damn kids for crying out loud.

761
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:29,489
Alright, video games. It's there.

762
01:40:29,489 --> 01:40:31,859
I think somebody said I can't breathe.

763
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,859
No! No!

764
01:40:33,859 --> 01:40:37,439
That bitch!

765
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:40,899
How dare she! He was mine!

766
01:40:40,899 --> 01:40:48,619
Alright, DIY is right here.

767
01:40:48,619 --> 01:41:03,970
They grow up so fast.

768
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:09,979
I feel like this is cheating. Is this cheating?

769
01:41:09,979 --> 01:41:18,689
How are the two kids grown up?

770
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:26,819
There's drinks? This seems like cheating.

771
01:41:26,819 --> 01:41:31,619
You weren't supposed to tell them about us.

772
01:41:31,619 --> 01:41:40,369
Kitchen.

773
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:46,130
Other side. If you're 36, your kids must be grown up by now.

774
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:53,020
Okay, mom.

775
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,020
Why are you going to have kids, Jeremy?

776
01:41:55,020 --> 01:41:57,899
Mom, I don't know if I'm ready for that.

777
01:41:57,899 --> 01:41:59,899
Oh, okay.

778
01:41:59,899 --> 01:42:04,939
You're older though, aren't you?

779
01:42:04,939 --> 01:42:08,210
Yeah, yeah. You know, 40 is-

780
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:11,220
I would say before 40,

781
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,460
it's probably when you should do-

782

Let's be real.

785
01:42:24,189 --> 01:42:26,189
Those of you that are trying to rush through your life,

786
01:42:26,189 --> 01:42:30,020

787
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,149

788
01:42:33,149 --> 01:42:38,380
Trust me. Slow down.

789
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:41,390
It's not a race.

790
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:43,949
It's not a race. Slow down.

791
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:51,500
Halloween over here. My dad was 42 when he had me.

792
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,149
Exactly, not a race. Slow down.

793
01:42:55,149 --> 01:43:02,829
I think we're good to go.

794
01:43:02,829 --> 01:43:05,199
It took me until I was fucking like 33.

795
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:08,960
Comfortable. So, you got time.

796
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,699
Relax. Trust me.

797
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:15,699
Food. Food is over here.

798
01:43:15,699 --> 01:43:24,979
Not over here? Where? Oh, no, no, no, no.

799
01:43:24,979 --> 01:43:28,989
Okay. I'm cheating. This is cheating.

800
01:43:28,989 --> 01:43:31,420
Where are your kids? I have fucking grandma's house.

801
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,659
Alright.

802
01:43:33,659 --> 01:43:36,029
I think that's all the boxes.

803
01:43:36,029 --> 01:43:38,029
I just have to run around and not get caught.

804
01:43:38,029 --> 01:43:40,909
Let's start it. Here we go. Three.

805
01:43:40,909 --> 01:43:46,850
Two.

806
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:49,090
I'm 32? You got fucking time.

807
01:43:49,090 --> 01:43:52,479
You got time, man. Seriously.

808
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:57,539
Guys, I couldn't even write

809
01:43:57,539 --> 01:43:59,539
like cursive until I was like fucking 31.

810
01:43:59,539 --> 01:44:01,539
So, don't worry.

811
01:44:01,539 --> 01:44:04,609
I couldn't sign papers correctly

812
01:44:04,609 --> 01:44:08,380
until I was like fucking 30.

813
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:10,750
Slow down. Not a race.

814
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:19,140
Excuse me.

815
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:25,409
Fucking baby, I hate this one.

816
01:44:25,409 --> 01:44:37,949

817
01:44:37,949 --> 01:44:42,750
Oh, thank

01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:44,750

01:44:44,750 --> 01:45:00,539
Guys, I didn't even know what...

820
01:45:00,539 --> 01:45:02,539
Okay, I always knew I wanted to be like an actor.

821
01:45:02,539 --> 01:45:04,979
Right? And over the years.

822
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:06,979
I don't...

823
01:45:06,979 --> 01:45:11,899
Excuse me.

824
01:45:11,899 --> 01:45:13,899
I want to be an actor. I want to be like a film person.

825
01:45:13,899 --> 01:45:15,899
I want to be like a director. Right?

826
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:20,380
But man, I really didn't...

827
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:25,500
I had no idea.

828
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
Now, I know a lot of people... Let's be real.

829
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,500
So, I know a lot of people on Twitch

830
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,500

831
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,810
They're a lot younger than I am.

832
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:36,430
I started really late.

833
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,800
There's a timer.

834
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,800
Fuck that existential bullshit.

01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,800
I got shit to do. I got to like do this.

836
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:48,819
Pretty much TLDR. Who gives a shit?

837

Like nevermind.

838
01:46:00,979 --> 01:46:02,979

01:47:01,579 --> 01:47:21,550

867
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,199
I was like in my late 20s dude when I even fucking knew what I wanted to do

868
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,159
I made like tf2 youtube videos and got like lucky

869
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:59,329
Trust me. I I lucked out a lot. So I was like 27 or 28. That's when I started

870
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:06,989
So trust me. You got plenty of time to figure it out. All right, we're gonna play slide in the woods

871
01:53:11,739 --> 01:53:24,189
This is a scary one. Yes. Yeah people saying yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh point is

872
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:27,250
This is something called late bloomer

873
01:53:28,609 --> 01:53:29,649
and

874
01:53:29,649 --> 01:53:32,029
That's okay

875
01:53:32,029 --> 01:53:36,800
And you don't even need to bloom who cares right? Like just just try to live your life as best you can

876
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:40,430
I think a lot of people are too concerned about

877
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:44,369
Trying to make it trying to do this trying to make sure you do this certain thing

878
01:53:45,010 --> 01:53:47,010
Just do your best, you know

879
01:53:47,090 --> 01:53:51,470
You don't have to bloom. You don't have to it's all right. You don't have to do that shit

880
01:53:53,859 --> 01:53:56,020
Just try to live the best life you can with what you got

881
01:53:56,739 --> 01:54:02,939
All right, this is called slide in the woods

882
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:20,590
22 20. Yeah, a lot of you guys are younger like trust me dude. I think about this

883
01:54:21,390 --> 01:54:22,829
I am like

884
01:54:22,829 --> 01:54:28,670
12 to 15 years older than a lot of you guys. I've been there before I I trust me. I know

885
01:54:30,609 --> 01:54:35,680
In a long time

886
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:38,479
You'll figure it out. You'll find your place in the fucking world

887
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,920
But it doesn't have to be like extravagant. It doesn't have to be like I think a lot of people

888
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:46,479
There's a lot of pressure I think on people now

889
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,760
To have to do something extravagant like you have to

890
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:52,619
No, you don't

891
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:54,539
You really don't like

892
01:54:54,539 --> 01:54:56,939
Just do you that's it man. Seriously

893
01:54:57,819 --> 01:55:00,829
Too much pressure nowadays way too much

894
01:55:01,390 --> 01:55:04,189
Let's go down the slide

895
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:15,699
And trust me the way you feel at like 17 18 19

896
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,720
Will change into your mid to late 20s. Trust me

897
01:55:25,789 --> 01:55:30,909
Ah scary monsters, right? All right. Sorry. Oh, no, never mind. I just went down the slide

898
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,739

01:55:45,149 --> 01:55:47,149
I trust me. I remember

902
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:52,380

903
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:58,699
I go up this way

904
01:55:58,699 --> 01:56:02,539
Don't put yourself under too much pressure. It's not worth it. It's not

905
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:05,779
as I thought

906
01:56:05,779 --> 01:56:07,899
But I was like 20

907
01:56:07,899 --> 01:56:13,060
I thought I was like I have to be a famous film director and famous actor

908
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:16,819
No, that's too much pressure. Just just do what you can

909
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:20,560
If it fucking works out it works out if not, you'll find something to do

910
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:32,350
How many times have to go down the slide?

911
01:56:32,350 --> 01:56:34,350
No one likes you when you're 23

912
01:56:36,189 --> 01:56:42,590
I got chronic pain. So do I

913

Luckily, it still has battery. Okay, just slow down. You're not gonna rush

917
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:33,649
Do I just keep going down the slide and it gets weirder?

918
01:57:33,890 --> 01:57:48,100
Where are my parents and the holidays I know can be rough on a lot of people as much as it's like

Oh, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas everybody. Oh, woohoo. Woohoo. Why didn't him friends?

926
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:44,720
Here's the notepad

927
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,039

982
02:08:32,670 --> 02:08:41,460
We're gonna play a little chill fun little game called freeways seems kind of fun. You have to make traffic patterns

983
02:08:41,859 --> 02:08:58,939
By the way, all these are on itch.io freeways. It's kind of cool. We're freeways. There it is. Okay, does it show up?

984
02:09:00,819 --> 02:09:02,850
Draw a road

02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:04,289
Uh, hold on

986
02:09:04,289 --> 02:09:14,100
this okay draw a road from the factory to highway six

987
02:09:18,829 --> 02:09:25,979
Like that easy you must connect all the roads to all other roads

988
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:29,310
All right, so we're gonna go like this

989
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:35,039
Like that look highway signs to see which roads still need to be connected

990
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:54,289
Oh fuck. I'm not gonna be able to do this like that six needs to go to oh

991
02:09:57,630 --> 02:10:04,300
oops

992
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:08,140
This needs to go over here. It does this needs to go that way. It does

993
02:10:08,619 --> 02:10:18,399
Did I do it?

994
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:20,399
This person was shit faced

995
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:27,329
This bit of a shit face that made this make sense. Did I work? Did it work?

996
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:56,210
Look at the arrows. I got it. It works. I don't get it clear. Okay

997
02:10:56,689 --> 02:10:59,890
Highway six needs to connect to 101 and one. Okay, so here we go

998
02:11:04,369 --> 02:11:06,369
This needs to go here and here

999
02:11:06,689 --> 02:11:13,920
Okay, you can go that way or that way

1000
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:16,239
You can also go

1001
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:34,670
Here I don't get it. I do it

1002
02:11:37,149 --> 02:11:42,260
I don't get it the directional arrows

1003
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:59,329
I don't get it

1004
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:14,260
By the way Boba Fett's in fortnight

1005
02:12:15,869 --> 02:12:31,840
Wait, all right traffic flow 71 complexity

1006
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:34,800
Okay

1007
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,699
New intersection. Let's go put over here

1008
02:12:50,159 --> 02:13:22,770
Everyone

1009
02:13:23,010 --> 02:13:31,470
Drive your fucking cars over here, dude the arrow what the hell drive let's go

1010
02:13:32,350 --> 02:14:06,130
Roundabout. Yeah, that's what i'm doing. I don't get it. Why is it not working drive your cars? It's fucking easy

1011
02:14:06,369 --> 02:14:32,029
It's kind of a mess

1012
02:14:32,029 --> 02:14:36,109
The direction you draw matters, okay 102 that's better than an a plus that's an s

1013
02:14:37,710 --> 02:14:52,420
So this is residential so green road. So this is a 17 north this goes down and this uh goes over here

1014
02:14:52,579 --> 02:15:02,420
This connects here. You can go to green road from here

1015
02:15:03,699 --> 02:15:06,100
splits

1016
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:08,100
You can't go that way

1017
02:15:10,779 --> 02:15:30,340
That's the wrong way. So if this is a highway and this can go through here

1018
02:15:31,149 --> 02:15:33,149
And this can go through here

1019
02:15:33,149 --> 02:15:44,000
And then they'll just figure it out because they're fucking god damn animals who cares this is they put lights here. It's easy

1020
02:16:03,659 --> 02:16:05,659
We're all ants on the highway. Who cares?

1021
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:15,779
We're all animals on the highway from space when they look down we're ants. We're all bugs. We're all animals. It doesn't matter

1022
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:08,909
So what all right? What do I do? This is residential. You have like one road that comes out

1023
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:15,489
One road that goes in play that

1024
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:24,219
No idiot

1025
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:28,690
And there's okay you get to get on the highway the highway's gonna go like here

1026
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:33,459
I don't know highways do like a weird circle of shit. I don't know

1027
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:20,979
I don't i'm not a city planner guys. We're all bugs. Who cares use ramps

1028
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:28,690
Oh, wait a minute

1029
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:46,049
All right, so that's above okay

1030
02:18:48,590 --> 02:19:30,370
I got it. What's the problem? What's going on? What's the problem people can come to and from wait a minute. Hold on

1031
02:19:37,229 --> 02:20:05,549
Mr. This dude's on coke. I don't get it. I don't I just can't I can't see things

1032
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:11,139
Mathematically, give me the glasses. We're all bugs. God damn it. Who cares?

1033
02:20:11,139 --> 02:20:43,309
We're all animals from up above in space. You need a ramp. I don't guys I just drive on the road

1034
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:48,399
I don't know how it works. I just go like this whenever I get to the port part where you guys are describing

1035
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:52,260
I go like this

1036
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:57,780
Big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle straight line

1037
02:20:57,860 --> 02:21:07,680
Oh, okay. Somebody planned this that's smarter than me. Uh, what's the game called freeways on itchy? EO freeways

1038
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:24,180
It's like three bucks. I don't get it. I'm moving on. I don't get it highways go like

1039
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:36,690
They keep going

1040
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:41,649
Highway it like take you get off the highway, but the highway the road keeps going

1041
02:21:46,819 --> 02:21:48,819
How this way?

1042
02:21:49,819 --> 02:21:51,819
And then this way

1043
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:55,260
And then this way

1044
02:21:55,260 --> 02:21:57,020
And then this way

1045
02:21:57,020 --> 02:22:08,030
I don't I don't I I don't understand. I can't do this. I I can't do it. I I don't have the fucking mathematics to reconnect everything

1046
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:41,549
Now take your goddamn turns

1047
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:11,549
Oh shit

1048
02:23:16,690 --> 02:23:37,200
That was freeways it's fun if you're smarter than I am go ahead and play it it's a cool game

1049
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,139

1053
02:24:02,020 --> 02:24:14,799

02:34:50,979 --> 02:34:54,739
Nice desk and floor in uh in four and a half minutes

1093
02:34:55,219 --> 02:34:58,989
I fucking knew this was gonna happen too

1094
02:34:58,989 --> 02:35:01,229
This stupid light I swear to god

1095
02:35:02,659 --> 02:35:04,979
I knew it. I was like, you know, that's probably dangerous

1096
02:35:08,350 --> 02:35:10,350
Hi karumba, of course

1097
02:35:14,700 --> 02:35:18,299
How you doing? Yeah, it's it's not good. It's all right

1098
02:35:27,709 --> 02:35:32,430
The thing is it's so annoying because that wasn't even like oh, he's drunk and he spilled. No, no, no. It's uh

1099
02:35:32,909 --> 02:35:36,959
Would you like to see where you are? I want to see what's right next to you

1100
02:35:42,500 --> 02:35:47,299
There's a light that's right next to the camera and I moved the desk too much

1101
02:35:48,350 --> 02:35:49,549
and it just like

1102
02:35:49,549 --> 02:35:54,540

1103
02:35:55,420 --> 02:36:03,729
Yo, we're good. This is expensive. This is like at least a 70 to 80 sweater

1104
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:14,450
Empty now, I think i'm good though. I'm gonna have to repaint that wall. I'm not kidding

Hello

1597
04:00:45,180 --> 04:00:50,500
We are delighted to see you enter this realm. You must leave your humanity

1598
04:00:51,139 --> 04:00:56,079
Abandon your idea of time and accept your mortality

1599
04:00:57,659 --> 04:01:03,280
You can leave and return as you will compared to your current life where there is only one way out you agree

1600
04:01:03,680 --> 04:01:06,209
Abandon humanity time and accept your mortality

1601
04:01:08,719 --> 04:01:16,219
Eh, I don't want to be I would I would want to live like 400 years tops total excellent

1602
04:01:17,379 --> 04:01:20,739
Like the human world we have blurred the lines of purpose, but the road is clear

1603
04:01:21,309 --> 04:01:23,309
It's after all for your amusement

1604
04:01:27,020 --> 04:01:30,219
I think like three or four hundred years is enough to you like you can see everything

1605
04:01:31,469 --> 04:01:33,629
I would live in every country for like five years

1606
04:01:38,940 --> 04:01:42,219
After it's like dude, uh, what what I don't want to do it anymore

What would you do for 400 years? I'd be able to fucking raise my great great great great grandkids

1608
04:01:58,030 --> 04:01:59,469
That's kind of cool

1609
04:01:59,469 --> 04:02:22,350
Someone said this game is hard. I'm a rhythm game andy though. I'm a rhythm game andy

1610

1611
04:02:35,090 --> 04:02:40,899
I should be fine

1612
04:02:40,899 --> 04:02:43,860
Seems like the wooden doll has started walking didn't think you'd wake up

1613
04:02:46,379 --> 04:03:04,030
Hmm, you're missing an arm. Can't let you back. Can you do it? Don't move

1614
04:03:08,209 --> 04:03:13,069
If I can hit one time i'm gonna give 100 community subs

You don't drink a whole bottle of wine and play this game like this right now. You kidding me?

1720
04:32:53,899 --> 04:32:58,139
When does it end? I feel like i've been here for like three years. How long have I been here for?

1721
04:33:12,520 --> 04:33:18,159
It's backwards. The game is backwards right now left is right right is left you shitting me, dude

1722
04:33:18,560 --> 04:33:35,150
Don't even god that was crazy. That was crazy

1723
04:33:36,639 --> 04:33:38,720
You're not supposed to be here. It seems you've returned early

1724
04:33:40,720 --> 04:33:42,639
This shouldn't be possible

1725
04:33:42,639 --> 04:33:44,330
Something is amiss

1726
04:33:44,330 --> 04:33:48,830
I cannot allow you to learn too much would interfere with your purpose

1727
04:33:51,180 --> 04:33:54,459
I will restore your body to before you started to um drift away

1728
04:33:55,099 --> 04:34:01,130
Okay, do what you were doing, but be careful. That was awesome

1729
04:34:02,409 --> 04:34:05,259
That was awesome

1730
04:34:05,259 --> 04:34:08,330
Wow

1731
04:34:08,330 --> 04:34:09,689
Okay

1732
04:34:09,689 --> 04:34:12,439
You want I can give you an absolute truth

1733
04:34:13,450 --> 04:34:15,610
This is certainly not the right way to do it

1734
04:34:16,169 --> 04:34:19,709
But it might help you

1735
04:34:19,709 --> 04:34:21,709
Or it might twist you

1736
04:34:21,709 --> 04:34:23,709
Do you want to hear the truth? Yeah

1737
04:34:23,709 --> 04:34:29,080
Tell me

1738
04:34:29,080 --> 04:34:30,759
Nothing is lost

1739
04:34:30,759 --> 04:34:33,720
Once life is death, there will be a part of transfer. You cannot be a part of

1740
04:34:34,520 --> 04:34:37,319
Departed oh the fucking departed fucking up

1741
04:34:42,939 --> 04:34:44,939
Don't watch the movie. I just saved you three hours

1742
04:34:46,959 --> 04:34:50,799
Our choices will be justified in the end. There'll be a reconciliation no matter how ugly

1743
04:34:54,060 --> 04:34:56,779
Take this truth that is now in your hands to interpret its meaning. Okay

1744
04:34:57,790 --> 04:35:00,509
Now you must continue it. I will restore your body

Okay, hopefully neverhood neverhood is one of my favorite games ever made analyze your work against my database and give you constructive feedback

1859
05:00:35,490 --> 05:00:38,619
I was made by scientists, so i'm really good at this

1860
05:00:39,020 --> 05:00:40,689
Don't worry. It sounds technical

1861
05:00:40,689 --> 05:00:48,830
But art school is really simple once you get the hang of it use your drawing pad to complete the assignments that I give you

Okay, get inspired sick loading assignment think of a number between one and 50 draw that many birds

Well, i'll do one

1869
05:01:54,029 --> 05:02:49,630
This sounds I've did it. Where's my prize? Where's my prize? What I can move. I got a color swatch

They're like, all right. How do I turn it in? How do I turn this in? Whoa?

1873
05:04:00,450 --> 05:04:09,790
Oh, okay. I'm here. All right. Look I gotta see I got brushes swatches. Let's go

1874
05:04:10,029 --> 05:04:23,759
What did you dream about last night two nights ago? Um last night

1875
05:04:24,000 --> 05:04:44,610
I don't think I had a dream last night. What was my last dream? What about the night before that?

1876
05:04:44,689 --> 05:04:55,549
Um, I don't know the last dream. I remember just drinking Gatorade out of somebody else's fridge

1877
05:04:59,659 --> 05:05:02,380
And it was like all the gatorades were mixed together it was weird

1878
05:05:02,619 --> 05:05:14,540
It was like all yellow purple green and red gatorade were all mixed together

1879
05:05:14,939 --> 05:05:21,380
Like they got the gatorades down to like here and they poured the last third of it into the same gatorade

1880
05:05:21,860 --> 05:05:25,040
And they did that they did that with like six of them

1881
05:05:25,810 --> 05:05:28,849
So they didn't want to drink the last like gross part of the gatorade

1882
05:05:28,849 --> 05:06:01,299
So they combined them all and put them back in the fridge and I drank it. All right, I got it

1883
05:06:01,459 --> 05:06:31,779
So I wait I gotta explore what's down here, okay, now what draw ingredients I need more colors

1884
05:06:32,099 --> 05:07:05,139
This has been open the whole time. Why didn't anybody tell me that who's open the whole time the entire fucking time

1885
05:07:17,139 --> 05:07:27,020
Where did the game go dude? What the fuck? What are you doing?

1886
05:07:27,560 --> 05:07:42,400
OBS, what are you drinking crack beer? It won't fucking close

1887
05:07:43,119 --> 05:07:51,889
It won't close. I just closed it. I get it. Oh my god

1888
05:07:59,060 --> 05:08:11,250
There's an there's an explanation for it get the fucking spider game out of my goddamn inventory

1889
05:08:11,810 --> 05:08:15,040
Get out of here. Oh my god. Why?

1890
05:08:23,889 --> 05:08:33,950
Here's what happened. I accidentally pinned the spider exe file to the taskbar and I kept thinking it was open

1891
05:08:34,590 --> 05:08:38,830
So I kept right clicking it to close it, but I kept opening new instances of the exe

1892
05:08:43,180 --> 05:08:45,340
So let's unpin that from the taskbar

1893
05:08:47,200 --> 05:08:48,080
and

1894
05:08:48,080 --> 05:08:51,020
Keep going

1895
05:08:51,099 --> 05:09:01,279

This drawing is going to end up in a big gold frame

1923
05:15:12,139 --> 05:15:23,360
Does that change how you approach it? Maybe a little so apparently apparently it's it's it's a twitch problem

1924
05:15:23,439 --> 05:15:32,159
I guess I have no idea. I guess twitch is having problems. It's not a twitch problem

1925
05:15:32,159 --> 05:15:54,259
It's a spider problem. The real question is is he gonna draw boogers down both the nostrils?

1926
05:15:54,659 --> 05:16:30,540
Of course he is he's in the fucking first grade. Where do I go? Oh new brush. Let's get it white

1930
05:17:17,950 --> 05:17:23,080

1931
05:17:23,939 --> 05:17:46,779
Oh basketball this game's cute. Stop minus twoing. It's been five and a half hours of quality fucking funny content

1932
05:17:47,180 --> 05:17:50,459
And just because I said one bad joke doesn't mean the whole stream was bad

1933
05:17:51,099 --> 05:17:52,459
scoff

1934
05:17:52,459 --> 05:17:53,659

1935
05:17:53,659 --> 05:18:02,349
Eye roll scoff and I turn this in so it gets off the screen

1936
05:18:02,750 --> 05:18:18,240
All right, give me out of here. It was five and a half hours of uh, ye clown cringe. That's your opinion. It's bad

1937
05:18:18,880 --> 05:18:26,540

1944
05:21:25,709 --> 05:21:27,709
That has all the things I just drew

1945
05:21:31,439 --> 05:21:33,439
In like a windows explorer

1946
05:21:33,439 --> 05:21:41,180

1956
05:22:41,470 --> 05:22:50,529
It's weird. It's very odd. That's very stretched. It shouldn't be

1957
05:22:52,939 --> 05:23:06,000
Faith is great. Okay, can I make this window bigger 20 community subs? Thanks for the 20 subs. That was by snaps cube

5 p.m. Christmas day. Oh my god, Australia, New Zealand

2020

All right. This is locked

2021

30 minutes of this this game. Uh, I don't know maybe

2022
05:30:03,619 --> 05:30:08,500
Was that a lie or is it do you actually follow deer? Should I follow the deer or is it a lie?

2023
05:30:09,220 --> 05:30:17,819
Taking a while a long time destroy the historical thing

2024
05:30:18,540 --> 05:30:29,759
Is it one guy? Okay

2025
05:30:29,759 --> 05:30:32,080
Deer just mess with the house and read the notes. Okay

2026
05:30:32,799 --> 05:31:41,069
Here's something

2027
05:31:49,439 --> 05:31:52,000
Oh shit my face

2028
05:31:52,000 --> 05:31:53,840
I'm sitting there like

2029
05:31:53,840 --> 05:32:01,540
What happened to the server?

2030
05:32:01,540 --> 05:32:03,540
Oh my god, I looked like a fucking psycho

2031
05:32:05,540 --> 05:32:07,540
Uh, my speed test is perfect

2032
05:32:07,540 --> 05:32:09,540
I don't understand. Well, i'm sorry buddy

2033
05:32:09,939 --> 05:32:14,259
I have a gigabit connection and i'm a thousand thousand up and down

2034
05:32:15,060 --> 05:32:25,229
Well, we'll probably i'm ending soon. Anyways, so whatever

2035
05:32:27,090 --> 05:32:29,330
dark twitch kind of uh

2036
05:32:30,959 --> 05:32:32,959
expedited that process maybe

2037
05:32:33,139 --> 05:32:43,229
You have rich rich streamer has gigabit connection

2038
05:32:43,950 --> 05:32:47,229
Do you have any idea how long it took me to get this connection?

2039
05:32:48,909 --> 05:32:51,139
I suffered

2040
05:32:51,139 --> 05:32:53,139
Those of the old viewers of this channel

2041
05:32:53,779 --> 05:32:55,779
Holy smokes. Do you remember?

2042
05:32:56,340 --> 05:32:59,459
Being on that old comcast old cock connect we would lose

2043
05:33:00,779 --> 05:33:03,180
I that's back when I was tripping like three or four times a week at least

2044
05:33:06,380 --> 05:33:08,860
We would drop 20 000 frames a day

2045
05:33:10,860 --> 05:33:13,299
This connection has been perfect

2046
05:33:13,299 --> 05:33:15,299
Without a single issue, which is awesome

2047
05:33:23,740 --> 05:33:25,419
What's the provider?

2048
05:33:25,419 --> 05:33:26,380
Oh

2049
05:33:26,380 --> 05:33:40,319
What's the key?

2050
05:33:45,979 --> 05:33:47,979
Okay, let's figure this out

2051
05:33:51,950 --> 05:33:53,950
Found it just gotta put the glasses on i'm fine

2052
05:33:59,099 --> 05:34:04,619
The martin's house lies about 100 yards off snake meadow hill road. There's almost no driveway

2053
05:34:05,020 --> 05:34:09,340
Trees jut out of the middle is a gravel path. That's mostly covered in grass. Holy smokes

2054
05:34:10,750 --> 05:34:12,189
Okay

2055
05:34:12,189 --> 05:34:13,470
Okay

2056
05:34:13,470 --> 05:34:14,750
I found it

2057
05:34:14,750 --> 05:34:24,830
That's the key to the house

2058
05:34:24,830 --> 05:34:26,830
Get away demons

2059
05:34:26,909 --> 05:34:49,180
That's the house key

2060
05:34:49,180 --> 05:35:04,479
Up left and then I think left one more time. Why was this itchy when most of these games are on steam?

2061
05:35:06,930 --> 05:35:09,490
You distracted me now. We have to do the whole thing again

2062
05:35:14,979 --> 05:35:17,060
Um, no, most these aren't on steam. What are you talking about?

2063
05:35:19,810 --> 05:35:22,049
I got all these on itch.io only like a few of them were on steam

2064
05:35:33,299 --> 05:35:37,380
I got all these on itch.io because I heard that itch.io gives a higher cut to people right?

2065
05:35:38,319 --> 05:35:40,049
