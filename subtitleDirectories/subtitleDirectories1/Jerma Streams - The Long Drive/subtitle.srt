1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:03,700
Somebody said he fell in the toilet again.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:09,099
I mean, just imagine how that would play out.

3
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:17,960
Like butt sinks in, arms and legs both sticking out, wiggling.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,059
Everybody help, I'm stuck!

5
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,179
That's not possible.

6
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:29,019
Maybe you got a tiny little toilet.

7
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:34,439
Like reaching with my index finger to try to press a text.

8
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,500
A phone that's in my other hand.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,659
Send plunger!

10
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,500
Or just go live like that and not even fucking care.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,539
Why are you live?

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,259
Why not?

13
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,950
My birthday was great.

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,810
I had a very good time on my birthday.

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,530
I went out to dinner.

16
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,200
Had some snacks.

17
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:15,340
It was actually very good.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,459
It was very nice.

19
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:20,709
I have one problem though.

20
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:25,670
I got this...

21
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,500
I don't even know where it came from.

22
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:33,500
I want some medical professionals in the chat here to tell me.

23
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,579
Hold on, let me tweet this out first.

24
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:42,379
My hand.

25
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,060
My hands have been immaculately clean and perfect.

26
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,180
Just baby soft.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,019
Since I was a teenager.

28
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,189
I've never had a single problem with my hands.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,870
They have been delicate.

30
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,989
They've been strong.

31
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:56,870
No calluses.

32
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,670
No warts.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,239
And until yesterday.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,739
What happened?

35
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,560
I think I have it.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,359
I think I know what happened.

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,239
But let me just keep going.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,840
I got a wart on my finger.

39
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,229
And it happened the day after my 35th birthday.

40
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,710
So I got one of those things and I was like,

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,669
what the fuck is going on?

42
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,389
This is bullshit.

43
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:23,909
Why do I have a wart on my finger?

44
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:27,289
I've never had a single growth.

45
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:27,530
Ever.

46
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,009
Like I said.

47
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,849
So I went and got one of those freezing kits.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,159
I freaked out and I was like,

49
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,280
I have to freeze this thing off.

50
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,490
I got one of those liquid nitrogen little like...

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,740
You don't get an STD on your finger.

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,939
Okay?

53
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:49,900
That's not what...

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,699
It's not...

55
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:51,419
Look at how...

56
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,419
What's the definition of that word?

57
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,699
Your fingers are not a sexual organ.

58
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,909
I have an STD on my hand.

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,539
That's not even...

60
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,139
That's not what that means.

61
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,849
They are though.

62
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,129
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:24,650
They are.

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,370
Omega Low.

65
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,229
Tell the STD story.

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,539
No.

67
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,060
Well, I looked this all up.

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,780
Apparently like...

69
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,259
This is why I don't like to touch anything.

70
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,189
It's like a vi...

71
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:41,830
You can like...

72
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,310
I don't know.

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,990
Touch like a door handle that somebody touched.

74
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:45,349
Touch like a...

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,689
Touch like a surface.

76
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,139
This is why I don't touch anything.

77
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,340
The day after my 35th birthday.

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:54,580
Bang.

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,099
You have a wart on your hand.

80
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,620
Now I've freezed it off and now it hurts.

81
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,770
So my gamer finger...

82
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,050
It's in it, by the way.

83
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,530
Debilitating retirement incoming.

84
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,969
It's on my gamer finger.

85
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:06,490
It's right where it sits.

86
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,490
Like on the fucking mouse.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,120
Like barely.

88
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,319
And I know everyone's going to say show it.

89
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,240
I don't want to show it because it's disgusting.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
And I will never...

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
I will not show this.

92
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,259
So okay.

93
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,139
If I click very gently today, you know why that is.

94
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,060
I'm not going to show it.

95
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,939
No, I'm not going to.

96
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,379
It's revolting and I hate it.

97
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,220
I don't like showing gross things on my body.

98
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,779
No, I don't want to.

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,220
I'm not going to do it.

100
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,180
I can't.

101
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,740
I won't do it.

102
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,060
All right.

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,220
Okay.

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,740
What if I blur the camera?

105
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,139
Oh shit.

106
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:40,300
Okay.

107
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,259
What if I censor it?

108
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,029
Anyway, let's just go over what we're doing.

109
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,540
We're going to be playing The Long Drive today.

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,740
We're going to play Left 4 Dead today.

111
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
But I had a bunch of scheduling conflicts.

112
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,660
So we're not going to do that today.

113
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,100
We're going to do it maybe another time.

114
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,579
Who knows?

115
00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:59,220
I don't know.

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,220
You know as good as I do right now.

117
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:06,620
Tomorrow I'm going to be on Kitboga's stream.

118
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm not streaming tomorrow.

119
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,420
I'll be elsewhere.

120
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,920
I'll make sure you know exactly where that is.

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,430
I have no idea when that is, by the way.

122
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,949
All I know is that it's going to happen.

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
Because the nature of what Kit does.

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,199
If he gets a good call, then maybe he'll want to bring me in.

125
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,720
If he's like, no, no, this one sucks.

126
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,439
No, no, no, no.

127
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,079
Forget this one.

128
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
But I will be on that stream.

129
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:35,660
Just kind of in the wings waiting to do something fun.

130
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,470
Am I going to use your voices?

131
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,459
I don't know.

132
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,899
It depends on whatever he wants to do.

133
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,470
That's the plan for the next, the remaining couple of days.

134
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,959
Now, if The Long Drive, if I'm done with The Long Drive in like an hour,

135
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,639
I'm just going to move on to that super game.

136
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,370
Like House Whipper.

137
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,620
All right.

138
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,819
Let me hold on.

139
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:57,220
Let me.

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
I have to put on pants.

141
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,259
And this is just I didn't think the cam was going to be on at all today.

142
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:02,899
I have to put on.

143
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:03,699
I have to put pants on.

144
00:06:03,699 --> 00:07:03,860
I'll be right back.

145
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,180
It's good.

146
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,860
We're still on the starting screen.

147
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,139
That's fine.

148
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:17,240
Okay.

149
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,199
How do I censor this?

150
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,399
I don't want to show this shit.

151
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,279
It's disgusting.

152
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,029
Okay.

153
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,149
Webcams not even plugged in.

154
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:32,459
There is a monster that sneaked into this room at night and unplugged my webcam.

155
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,100
It's not me.

156
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,509
Why is it unplugged?

157
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,410
All the stupid things.

158
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:42,889
Why?

159
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,649
Why unplug my webcam?

160
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,329
Why not pull the power cord out?

161
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:47,290
That's way funnier.

162
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,250
I don't know.

163
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,370
I can't turn my computer on.

164
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,250
There's something wrong with it.

165
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm going to fucking work.

166
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,850
Who is unplugging my webcam?

167
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,699
Did you guys hear like a doodledoo?

168
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,839
You did?

169
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:16,899
You should have.

170
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,180
Hey, there we go.

171
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,420
Okay.

172
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,699
All right.

173
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,589
So here's the deal.

174
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,470
I'm going to blur this.

175
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,449
My hair is a fucking mess.

176
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:29,850
Hold on.

177
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,889
It's delayed too.

178
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,809
I'll tell you that the trouble I'm going through right now to show you guys a wart on my finger

179
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,210
is it's insane that I'm doing this.

180
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:46,419
Okay.

181
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,179
So please not have like a weird frame here.

182
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:54,070
Okay.

183
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,110
I'm like so scared.

184
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,470
I like don't know if I should do this.

185
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,509
Okay.

186
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,840
You see?

187
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:07,850
Can you see?

188
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:08,730
Okay.

189
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,289
So here.

190
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:10,009
Clean.

191
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,210
Clean normal hands.

192
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,580
Regular.

193
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,820
See?

194
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,659
There's nothing weird there.

195
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:19,500
I cannot put my right hand up.

196
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:19,740
Okay.

197
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,340
Should I do it from far away?

198
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:28,440
No, I have to blur it.

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,039
This is not how big this was.

200
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,440
Okay.

201
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,080
It's after I froze this shit is when it did this.

202
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,700
So I like put the freezer on there for like 10 seconds or whatever.

203
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,190
And you take it off and your skin turns like all white.

204
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,539
And then it like it started inflating.

205
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,059
It actually started inflating.

206
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,019
I'm not kidding.

207
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,600
Okay.

208
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
If I show you from far away, that's that's like, oh, it's okay.

209
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,320
Right?

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:10:03,899
This is so embarrassing.

211
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:04,460
Do you see?

212
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,179
It hurts.

213
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,940
I'm not going to show it up close.

214
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,159
It's not alive.

215
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,399
All right.

216
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,559
I'll show it up close with us with a sensor tag on it.

217
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:17,960
Hold on.

218
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,940
It's literally nothing.

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,139
No, it is something.

220
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,620
You don't make me show it up close.

221
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,019
I will.

222
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:27,269
Okay.

223
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,590
Hold on.

224
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,990
I need to put a I need to put a blurring effect on this.

225
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,509
I need to focus the camera.

226
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:32,940
Okay.

227
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,340
Here we go.

228
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Ready?

229
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,720
All right.

230
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,039
Okay.

231
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,720
So we're completely censored now.

232
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,679
So like doesn't matter.

233
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,679
Like you're not going to puke.

234
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:51,750
See?

235
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,789
I've been completely censored.

236
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,389
I could be in a fucking TV commercial.

237
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,190
I could be like a law show and you would have no idea who I was.

238
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,460
We need more censoring for this.

239
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,059
We need more censoring for this.

240
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,149
We need more censoring.

241
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:26,889
See?

242
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:30,230
I told you.

243
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,350
I told you it wasn't good.

244
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:36,440
And this shit's right on my gamer finger.

245
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,279
It's a homunculus.

246
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,379
No, it's not.

247
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,820
I it's that's from the freeze.

248
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,899
It was tiny but I freaked out because I'm 35 now and I can't have warts on my hands.

249
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:48,379
35.

250
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm not 80, 105.

251
00:11:50,620 --> 00:12:00,379
So it's on my gamer finger.

252
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,100
Long story short.

253
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
And you ain't ever going to see me again.

254
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,840
I'm turning the face cam off.

255
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,039
I don't want it on.

256
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,389
This ain't a face cam stream.

257
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,350
Imple popping.

258
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,070
Don't say that.

259
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,950
Oh, it's disgusting.

260
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,269
I hate it.

261
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,309
I don't even like looking at it.

262
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,539
I'm an incredibly clean person.

263
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm so clean.

264
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,320
I shower.

265
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,759
I bathe.

266
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,240
I I do the I do I you know what I mean?

267
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,360
Like I bathe.

268
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:36,279
I go like this and like that doesn't bathe.

269
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:36,440
Yeah.

270
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
I go under the armpits too.

271
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,440
You don't.

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,559
You don't.

273
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,299
You just put the shampoo conditioner combo can thing that you buy at the grocery store

274
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,059
and you pour that on your head

275
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,740
and you shake that into a lather and then you let it run all over your body

276
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,580
while you smear your hands all over your body

277
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,200
and like all over your legs and balls and stuff.

278
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,000
That's what you do.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,279
I know it is because that's what I did until I was about 30.

280
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:09,220
No, I use a puffy.

281
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,259
No, you don't.

282
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,179
You don't use a puffy until you're at least 28.

283
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:16,679
It was five years ago.

284
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,120
Five years is a long time, man.

285
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:20,940
That's a long time.

286
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,740
Every time I click.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,610
Do I have to go on like the streamer like disabled list for 15 days?

288
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,200
Because I can't click the mouse.

289
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,049
All right, the Boston Red Sox have to put German 985 down to the disabled list.

290
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:47,129
You see, it's a big wart on his finger.

291
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,490
It isn't that embarrassing.

292
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,860
Back to you, John.

293
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,289
Please just drain it.

294
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:57,929
You're not supposed to.

295
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:58,330
No.

296
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,970
The wart specialist that I watched on YouTube said don't drain it when it becomes a boil.

297
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:11,429
They said after you do the freeze, it's going to do that and leave it alone.

298
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:12,149
Yeah, there's a...

299
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:16,309
Guys, are you that shocked that there's a wart specialist on YouTube?

300
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:22,389
You're like witches and warlocks on YouTube.

301
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,000
You don't think there's a wart guy?

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
All right, here we go.

303
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,679
This is the long...

304
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,720
I don't know what peaceful means.

305
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm assuming there's like monsters or something.

306
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,879
I don't know.

307
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:37,740
I got $50 from Goiki.

308
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,899
Thanks for the 50, the 5,000 bits.

309
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:43,659
And they say, hey, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer ticking down sound haunted me while

310
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,899
I tried to sleep at the last stream.

311
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:46,700
Keep up the good work.

312
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:52,100
Get well from the gameritis growth on your gamer finger.

313
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,620
You know, you have a really great message because it says,

314
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,059
Hi, Jeremy, the monkey ball timer trickling down sound haunted me while I tried to sleep

315
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:01,539
last night.

316
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,100
Your stream was haunting me and I felt horrible.

317
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,139
Keep up the good work.

318
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:09,879
Thanks, though.

319
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:10,840
That's a lot of money.

320
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,860
Thanks for the 50 bucks.

321
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,580
Silence Serenity.

322
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,460
Thanks for five subs.

323
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,419
And Nuclear Waffle.

324
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,299
Thanks for five subs.

325
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,259
Thanks, guys.

326
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:19,980
Are we ready?

327
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,700
How do we...

328
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,419
I don't know how to play.

329
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:27,139
Wait, this is like...

330
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,740
I thought this was a driving game.

331
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,639
Hold on.

332
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,470
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,429
E is open.

334
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,429
Why do I feel like I'm playing fucking TF2 at like 400 FOV?

335
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,460
Oh, you actually have to hold it.

336
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,639
Is there any sound?

337
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,879
Why is it so low?

338
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,289
Hold on.

339
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:53,610
Seed.

340
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,009
All right.

341
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,570
Okay, there's my fucking personal telephone number.

342
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,809
Hold on.

343
00:15:58,809 --> 00:15:59,929
Let's put this up.

344
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:05,049
Is it better?

345
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,090
Okay, I can actually hear now.

346
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,409
All right.

347
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:07,370
What does this do?

348
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,169
Tab is equip.

349
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,610
Middle mouse button is rotate.

350
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,519
Oh, shit.

351
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,639
It's one of these games.

352
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:17,690
Move.

353
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,610
Okay, see, that's how you wash.

354
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,639
Okay.

355
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,220
Scroll is move.

356
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,980
You can move it towards you or forward.

357
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:29,419
Right mouse button is rotate.

358
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,009
Middle mouse and right mouse.

359
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,529
Well, this is going to be a fucking joy.

360
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,529
Wait, you guys can't see anything?

361
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,980
Why did that happen?

362
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,299
Okay, so tab is equipped.

363
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,419
We got mouth wash, left mouse button, mouse wash.

364
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,259
Oh, cool.

365
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,850
This is so much fun.

366
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,129
Okay, cool.

367
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,250
Wait, cotton candy.

368
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:05,130
All right, so how do I pick this up?

369
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,329
How do I put this down?

370
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,309
Oh, F, pick that up.

371
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,140
And what the hell is this?

372
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:20,890
This is a duster.

373
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,250
Okay, I don't think that's what that is.

374
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:25,740
Eat this.

375
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,849
Can you?

376
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:35,990
I'm trying to do like party tricks.

377
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,990
All right, well, what am I supposed to do?

378
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,190
This is the cotton candy.

379
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,930
Do I need any of this stuff?

380
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,130
Wait, there's a gas tank.

381
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:52,460
This is going to take a while to get used to these controls.

382
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,660
Why is there a gun?

383
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,339
Is it a gun?

384
00:17:55,339 --> 00:18:00,069
How do I use the gun?

385
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,619
I gotta clean the barrel.

386
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,900
A little rusty.

387
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,029
Oh, dude, I'm going to do the thing that happens

388
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:16,630
like John Wick when he goes,

389
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,259
get the hell out of my way.

390
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,779
You know what I'm trying to do.

391
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:26,089
Hey, seems like you're the one that's in my way.

392
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,180
How do I put items down?

393
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,769
Do I have to shoot with my other hand?

394
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:44,859
See, to me, this is like if you were like

395
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,059
a gun novice or something,

396
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,660
this thing on my right hand would be like

397
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,460
a product that somebody would sell.

398
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
That's just an absolute stupid bullshit product

399
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,220
that's supposed to help with suppressing the fire.

400
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,339
Here's the gun grip.

401
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,579
I feel like that would be on like an infomercial

402
00:18:58,579 --> 00:18:59,700
that like four o'clock in the morning

403
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,579
that no one would buy.

404
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,319
You sick of the big recoil on your shotgun?

405
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,200
Not anymore.

406
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,259
All right, what the fuck do I do?

407
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:10,460
How do I put this down?

408
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,970
All right, I gotta look at the controls.

409
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,059
Mount, pick, mount, dismount.

410
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,779
Equip, reload, sleep.

411
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:30,299
Wait a minute.

412
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,420
Why is there a piss button?

413
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,789
Okay, this just turned into a completely different game.

414
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,150
This turned into a different game.

415
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,359
I don't know.

416
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,240
This is stupid.

417
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,700
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.

418
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,460
I still don't even know how to put things down.

419
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,109
All right, one, two.

420
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,869
Okay, so that's...

421
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,900
And I have a gun now.

422
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,940
How do I fire it?

423
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:15,579
What's this?

424
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:16,299
Okay, oh, there we go.

425
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,019
It's just in my inventory.

426
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,259
All right, give me the binoculars.

427
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,299
Good, okay.

428
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,700
Give me the fly swatter.

429
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,259
No, fuck that.

430
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:23,700
What's the pointless...

431
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,680
Ammo!

432
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,319
Nice.

433
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,630
Okay, pick up the ammo.

434
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,990
Okay, let's clean the car.

435
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,170
Is this doing anything?

436
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,049
Dismount.

437
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:44,549
How do I open the garage?

438
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:52,119
It's fantastic.

439
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:52,599
Okay, let's...

440
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,960
That's bright.

441
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,839
That's really bright.

442
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,559
What do I have to do?

443
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,519
This is a long drive, apparently.

444
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,519
I'm actually...

445
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,799
I wanna see what's in here.

446
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,960
Anything downstairs?

447
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:14,660
Ah!

448
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm gonna put this in my dashboard thing.

449
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,230
You know, people have it on their rear view mirror.

450
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,430
Can I put this on there?

451
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,450
All right, hold on.

452
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,410
Open the door.

453
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:36,250
Okay, how do I get in?

454
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:39,750
Sit.

455
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,130
Nice!

456
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,769
Oh, I have to drive.

457
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
Okay, close this door.

458
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,799
And then we pull out?

459
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,839
Do I have gas?

460
00:21:54,839 --> 00:22:03,450
How do I drive?

461
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,289
There's a crosshair.

462
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:15,660
Put this down.

463
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,640
Put the ammo somewhere.

464
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,400
All right, how do I turn the car on?

465
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,200
Oh, shit.

466
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,440
Okay.

467
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,369
How do you drive?

468
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,670
Oh, boy.

469
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,589
Okay, okay, all right, all right.

470
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:45,339
Okay, let's go.

471
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,220
And then we just drive.

472
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,250
Wait, we're driving too.

473
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:53,049
Dude, I can't even see!

474
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:54,329
I can't see the road!

475
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,470
Is there a road?

476
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,019
Oh, okay, but this is the road.

477
00:23:10,579 --> 00:23:17,720
Okay, is it like this ultra bloom effect or what?

478
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,039
How far...

479
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:18,680
What do I have to go?

480
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,859
How do I turn up the super bloom?

481
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,440
You can't.

482
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,960
What do you mean I can't?

483
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,549
Wrong side of the road.

484
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,069
Ow, my gamer wart!

485
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:43,990
That hurts so bad.

486
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,289
See?

487
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,130
That's why I told you I couldn't fucking play.

488
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,890
That would have killed me, I think.

489
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,690
All right, slow down.

490
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,250
I gotta slow down.

491
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,009
Slice it off.

492
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,210
Wait, what am I doing?

493
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,650
No, don't open the door.

494
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,019
How do I use this?

495
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,859
Oh, it's cigarettes.

496
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,660
It's not ammo.

497
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:21,900
Okay.

498
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,740
How do you throw shit?

499
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:26,940
How do I drop?

500
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,400
Yeah.

501
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,720
Oh, okay.

502
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,440
All right, now I got two hands on the wheel.

503
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,319
So what's the goal here?

504
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,460
Do I have like a task?

505
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,099
It's just to drive.

506
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,700
All right, well, I'm gonna fucking kill this.

507
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,980
This game is gonna be done.

508
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:00,920
What's the end goal?

509
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,119
How far do you need to get?

510
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,559
Turn on the radio.

511
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,640
I don't think I have a radio.

512
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,980
It's long.

513
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,799
All right.

514
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:16,759
Well, I'm all right with that.

515
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,279
Actually, I prefer this.

516
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:18,839
Is that weird?

517
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,309
Watch out for that fucking rock.

518
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,779
What's that?

519
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:40,009
Did they just keep putting more obstacles?

520
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,900
You have gas.

521
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:48,660
I have like no gas in the tank.

522
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,960
What do you get gas?

523
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,859
I'm going 130, 140 miles per hour right now.

524
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,880
I need to go to a gas station, a gas store.

525
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:05,500
Really?

526
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:06,779
I have a GPS.

527
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,569
What's that?

528
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,450
I see something right there.

529
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,130
There's a house right there.

530
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:21,819
Hit the brakes, hit the brakes.

531
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,019
Brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes.

532
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,140
Brakes, hit the brakes, hit the brakes.

533
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:28,220
Holy shit, there's other cars here.

534
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,740
What happened?

535
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:35,690
What?

536
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:48,809
Did I drink it?

537
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:57,079
What did I just do?

538
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:00,019
How did I drink that without taking the cap off?

539
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:00,819
How do you throw things?

540
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:03,640
Nice.

541
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,700
Pick up.

542
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,339
What even is it?

543
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,150
This is gonna be fucking...

544
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,109
This is disgusting.

545
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:26,710
Come on.

546
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,799
It's been three days since I've had anything to drink.

547
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,009
Okay, that's probably against the rules.

548
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:36,970
I probably shouldn't do that.

549
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,029
Is that gas?

550
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:40,490
Ow.

551
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:42,019
Oh, shit.

552
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:42,579
Okay, here we go.

553
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:44,900
Push.

554
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,619
Ah, that's fun.

555
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:51,109
Okay, gas.

556
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,980
How much is in here?

557
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,480
I can drink the gasoline.

558
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,410
All right, how do I fill up a car?

559
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,049
Okay, here we go.

560
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,539
Open this and then gas.

561
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:11,640
Nice.

562
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,759
Is there an easier way to throw?

563
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,759
Okay, wait, can I suck the gas out of this one?

564
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:27,660
Hold on, I can...

565
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:42,329
Can you actually do that?

566
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:47,589
All right, how do I put this back on?

567
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:54,779
All right, this game just got way cooler.

568
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:55,420
Wrong side.

569
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,180
Okay, I gotta back this thing up.

570
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,789
I don't know why I do...

571
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,150
Okay, that song, was it...

572
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,210
I'm just telling you that's what I hear, okay?

573
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,089
How do I get the fuck out of the car?

574
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,170
I don't want to take the other door off.

575
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,569
Get out.

576
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,700
Out.

577
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:30,299
Lean is Q and mouse?

578
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,089
Oh, that's kind of cool.

579
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,880
Okay, how do I get the fuck out of here?

580
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,299
I don't...

581
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:39,700
What?

582
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,059
I don't want to take the radio out.

583
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,190
E, okay, let's go.

584
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,819
What else is in here?

585
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,730
Extra tires, take them.

586
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,369
Oh, shit.

587
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:52,250
Can I put this in the trunk?

588
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,099
Okay, put the tire in the trunk.

589
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,380
You always need to spare.

590
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,460
What is this?

591
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:09,160
Can't see.

592
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,640
What does it say?

593
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:11,609
Car oil.

594
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,049
Extra virgin car oil.

595
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:13,930
All right, let's put it in there.

596
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:22,069
4% oil.

597
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,140
Diesel.

598
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,180
All right, 47% gas.

599
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,259
40% diesel, 30% oil, okay.

600
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,109
Can you open this?

601
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:35,589
Oh, wait.

602
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:41,400
Right.

603
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,900
I didn't...

604
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,339
Look, it's a video game, guys.

605
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:44,779
I didn't think I could actually open the hood.

606
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:47,619
It's getting dark out.

607
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,339
Put this back on.

608
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:49,299
All right, I gotta go.

609
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:51,220
I'm probably just gonna bring like creepers and shit.

610
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:56,180
Okay, this is scaring the shit out of me.

611
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,220
Wait, I gotta fill up the gas.

612
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,180
Fill up the gas, fill up the gas.

613
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,680
All right, fill this up.

614
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,059
Can I fill it up with this?

615
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:10,259
All right, hurry up.

616
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,460
I need to take one more thing.

617
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,500
I don't know what that is.

618
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,829
I don't know what this is.

619
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:16,599
I don't know.

620
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,880
I'm gonna take it with me though.

621
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,200
Ow!

622
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,519
Shit, that fucking hurt.

623
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,710
Let's go.

624
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,750
No, don't take that off.

625
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,470
Get in the car.

626
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,400
I can't see anything.

627
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,450
Okay.

628
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,900
How do I turn my headlights on?

629
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,809
How do you turn headlights on?

630
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,500
What does it say?

631
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:04,900
What's wrong?

632
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:08,680
You broke the car.

633
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,950
Turn on the headlights.

634
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,309
I don't know how to turn the headlights on.

635
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:18,809
Because you put oil in the gas tank.

636
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:26,569
I can't fucking see anything.

637
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,569
You put three types of fuel in here.

638
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:29,450
Fucking whatever.

639
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,410
All right, give me this one.

640
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:36,980
Get in here.

641
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,369
This one will...

642
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,809
This one probably at least has gas, right?

643
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,059
Shit, I just have to use my shitty car?

644
00:32:52,779 --> 00:33:10,819
How do I turn on the headlights?

645
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,849
Handbrake, space, accelerate, brake, steer, ignition.

646
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,289
Eye, lean, lean up.

647
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:17,609
Lights!

648
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:26,759
You lost in the tutorial.

649
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,920
Well, I'm learning how to play in the tutorial.

650
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,720
I'll get it next time.

651
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,700
Go back for the motorcycle.

652
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,619
I didn't see a motorcycle.

653
00:33:44,339 --> 00:34:05,980
Oh, blood.

654
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,849
That came out of my mouth.

655
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,670
Just spit out a bunch of kool-aid.

656
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,579
Can I get a different camera angle?

657
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,039
Oh, that might have been it.

658
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,989
That might have been it.

659
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:40,980
Longest drive, seven kilometers.

660
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,630
Doesn't seem very far at all, actually.

661
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:44,949
Okay.

662
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:46,760
All right, let's go.

663
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,239
Continue.

664
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,059
Wait a minute.

665
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,570
It gives you checkpoints?

666
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,800
This is not good, though.

667
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,239
I still don't have the gas.

668
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,269
This car has a bunch of fucking different fuel in it.

669
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,269
Can I do anything about this?

670
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,619
All right, what's this?

671
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,909
Can I bring this with me?

672
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,139
Oh, what's this thing?

673
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,780
This looks dangerous.

674
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:32,579
Oh, shit.

675
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,260
This is a way better car this time.

676
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,059
Give me the gun.

677
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:40,840
Give me the pew-pew balls.

678
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:49,449
Give me the oil if I need it.

679
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,909
Give me the coffee.

680
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,039
Whoa.

681
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,360
Oh, this is the front of the car.

682
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,159
No, it's not.

683
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:06,119
What kind of trunk is this?

684
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,090
What?

685
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,989
It's a front engine, a back engine.

686
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,590
What the fuck?

687
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,909
I've never seen a back engine.

688
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:27,110
This is freaking me out.

689
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:34,090
I've never seen this before in my life, in my entire life.

690
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,190
Oh, there's a block of gold.

691
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,809
This actually is a brick of gold.

692
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:41,369
All right, I need this.

693
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,989
Fucking god damn it.

694
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:45,030
It's over here.

695
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:51,820
Okay.

696
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,940
Holy shit, Jeremy.

697
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,579
Are you stupid?

698
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:59,960
There's like a bunch of gas here.

699
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,760
Pick it up.

700
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:15,820
Pick it up.

701
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,139
Good.

702
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,019
It fits.

703
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,300
I don't care.

704
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,099
What am I going to be?

705
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,250
Binoculars for what?

706
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,949
Oh, airbrush?

707
00:37:27,909 --> 00:37:28,469
Oh, wait.

708
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:29,429
That's an emergency light.

709
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:29,829
I need that.

710
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:45,579
Go get the girlfriend downstairs.

711
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:46,860
What girlfriend is downstairs?

712
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,289
Whatever.

713
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:52,250
Wait, can I take...

714
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:52,809
What's in here?

715
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:54,329
Is it alcohol?

716
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,250
This is just all full alcohol.

717
00:37:58,179 --> 00:37:58,739
I can just make...

718
00:37:58,739 --> 00:37:59,219
Can I make...

719
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:00,260
Wait, this is diesel.

720
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,300
Okay, can I pick this up?

721
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,139
Okay, we're going to take this.

722
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,760
I'm going to put this in the back seat.

723
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,820
You never know.

724
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,219
I might find a truck and I could use it.

725
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,900
All right, this is like...

726
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,380
Okay, I bought a coffee table one time.

727
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,119
And I jacked up the entire inside of the back of my car

728
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,199
because I was like, no, I can get it in there.

729
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,639
And I technically could.

730
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,880
I could technically get it in there,

731
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,760
but not, like, safely to not ruin your entire backseat.

732
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,320
It technically fits in there,

733
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,679
but I ripped up a bunch of shit.

734
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,480
I ripped up the seats.

735
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,760
I scratched the fucking ceiling.

736
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:45,349
Let's see if I can get this in here.

737
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:46,550
Oh, yeah, I can.

738
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,030
Just remove it.

739
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,750
Just take the doors off.

740
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:49,699
What the fuck am I going to need these for?

741
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:50,099
Who cares?

742
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:57,659
Yep, just like the coffee table.

743
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:03,610
Wait, can I put this back on?

744
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:06,389
All right.

745
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:07,110
Yeah, we're good.

746
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,380
This is exactly what it looked like, by the way.

747
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,539
Except it wasn't as tall.

748
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:13,179
I can still see.

749
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,030
Okay, I need this emergency light.

750
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,099
Oh, that's how you throw.

751
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:21,769
That's how you throw.

752
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:22,409
What's under there?

753
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,050
That's pretty cool, but I don't...

754
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:34,090
Wait, wait a minute.

755
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,650
All right, I'm ready.

756
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:42,250
It's time to get huge.

757
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,380
I think I'm ready, right?

758
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:50,070
What the fuck was that sound?

759
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,630
Close the door!

760
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,630
I'm safe in the car, right?

761
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:55,659
What was that?

762
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:56,300
What was that?

763
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:01,510
Oh, what happened?

764
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,909
He died.

765
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:02,550
He's dead.

766
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,030
What happened to him?

767
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,829
What is this?

768
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:17,980
It's like a giant bunny.

769
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,170
Get out of there.

770
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,119
It ran into the wall and died.

771
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,429
Get out of there.

772
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:31,670
I know.

773
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,150
I'm just scared.

774
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,469
I'm just...

775
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,099
I believe.

776
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,260
I don't know why this just scared me so much.

777
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,380
Why did that scare me?

778
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,500
I thought another one was right there.

779
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,059
All right, I'm out.

780
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,150
Let's go.

781
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,369
I can't see anything.

782
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,489
Okay, I'm going to get this.

783
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,289
This is going to be fun.

784
00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,309
Let's go.

785
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:07,929
This way, right?

786
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:13,659
I'm good.

787
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:15,739
All right, I'm looking for a big truck.

788
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:23,130
Turn on the radio.

789
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:27,380
I don't have any song files in that folder.

790
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:27,860
I saw that.

791
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,889
Music distracts the shit out of me when I'm driving.

792
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:34,329
That's why I never drive with music on.

793
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,809
You're not going to fuck with me.

794
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,889
No, I don't like driving with music.

795
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:49,690
It distracts me.

796
00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:55,289
You're a psycho.

797
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:56,250
No, I just...

798
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:56,969
Look.

799
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:57,210
What?

800
00:41:58,409 --> 00:42:00,570
So you want me to drive around with distractions?

801
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,480
I have to take a sip out of this drink,

802
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,159
but I'm afraid to because I think I'll drive into something.

803
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:05,719
Let's slow down.

804
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,070
No, I don't drive music.

805
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:22,119
All right, so I have a whole thing of gas.

806
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,000
We're looking for a truck.

807
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,489
Why did that just go down the wrong pipe?

808
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:32,170
Hold on.

809
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:43,460
Okay, sorry.

810
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,739
I just like swallowed that wrong.

811
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:50,340
And no distractions.

812
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,219
Stop distracting me.

813
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,230
No, I don't talk.

814
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,670
I don't want to talk to you in the car either.

815
00:42:56,469 --> 00:42:57,909
This is how every car ride is.

816
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:10,219
No, it's not.

817
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:10,699
I'm not that...

818
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,059
All right, easy.

819
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,519
Look, I can talk and drive, but I cannot listen and drive.

820
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,659
So you want to get in my car?

821
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:27,579
I'm going to monologue the fuck at you.

822
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,420
But you can't talk to me.

823
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,769
All right, we got a pit stop here.

824
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,489
What do we got?

825
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,309
Oh, dear.

826
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:45,030
Okay, hold on.

827
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,670
What about my gas though?

828
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:56,219
I want to get out of the car.

829
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,139
I want to get out of the fucking car.

830
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,139
I want to get out of the car.

831
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,449
What is this?

832
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,769
This is like a Marty McFly bike.

833
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:19,269
I hear a fucking weird noise.

834
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:22,010
Oh, there's no tires on it.

835
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,699
All right, let's go.

836
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:30,710
Ah, what kind of tires does it need?

837
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,349
Does it have gas?

838
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,650
Turn your car off.

839
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,199
All right, turn it off.

840
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,550
Push and steer?

841
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:46,869
Why can't I push?

842
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,420
It's so stupid.

843
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,619
Okay, turn the car off though.

844
00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:07,940
For real.

845
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,500
Turn it off.

846
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,900
I turned off the car.

847
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,500
Aye.

848
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,300
Okay, thank you.

849
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:25,369
What's that?

850
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:41,639
Okay, stay there.

851
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,480
I got to get tires for this.

852
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:48,519
What is it?

853
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,079
Radiation?

854
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:50,809
Gas.

855
00:45:51,369 --> 00:46:00,969
What does this take?

856
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,530
Does it have a fucking gas tank?

857
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,219
Is this just a bicycle?

858
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,840
This is just a bicycle.

859
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,679
This is not a motorcycle.

860
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,409
Get out of the way.

861
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:22,969
Really?

862
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:26,679
Okay, tire.

863
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:27,429
Get this.

864
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:28,309
Pick this up.

865
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:49,510
Oh, okay, that does not work.

866
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:55,539
Does it need special bike tires or what?

867
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,829
Do we need a bike tire?

868
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:08,539
Where am I going to find a bike tire?

869
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:17,670
This shit should work.

870
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:23,980
Hey, all right, this one.

871
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,550
All right, sit it down.

872
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,150
Okay, pick this up.

873
00:47:32,150 --> 00:48:03,719
It's dirty, that's why.

874
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:04,840
What the fuck?

875
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,590
What's wrong with this?

876
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,460
Because there's a hubcap on it?

877
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,119
Oh, shit.

878
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,320
Okay, I got a bike now.

879
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,840
I got a bike, I got a bike, I got a bike.

880
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,829
I got a bike.

881
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:22,550
Give me the bike.

882
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:27,179
All right, is there any space for me to pick the fucking thing up, please?

883
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,199
All right, what's a better car?

884
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:40,599
The green Cadillac or the red McQueen?

885
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:41,719
No tire?

886
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,599
What do you mean no tire?

887
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:50,550
It's right here.

888
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:52,469
Well, it would work if I could sit on here.

889
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:56,570
Whoa, I thought you said there was no gas.

890
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,769
You said there was no gas.

891
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:58,650
You said there was no gas.

892
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,510
You said it was a bike.

893
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,010
Why?

894
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:03,469
Liars.

895
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,530
Stand this up.

896
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:11,179
You said it was a bicycle.

897
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:16,780
All right, let's go.

898
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:29,219
Here we go.

899
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,179
This is a bicycle.

900
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:31,139
What's the gas for?

901
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:46,469
It's for turbo.

902
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:47,829
All right, I have to get on this now.

903
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:48,869
I have to leave now.

904
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:49,800
I have to get out.

905
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,360
I have to leave now.

906
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm freaking out.

907
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,559
I got 100% gas.

908
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:56,059
Can I put anything on the back?

909
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,079
Stay upright.

910
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,280
How do I get it to stand up?

911
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,239
Where's the kickstand?

912
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,340
Oh, my fucking God.

913
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,820
Press B.

914
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:18,780
Balance.

915
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,139
Okay, I have to get on now.

916
00:50:20,139 --> 00:50:21,579
Get on the bike.

917
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:21,980
Get on the bike.

918
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,380
Just get on.

919
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,019
Just get on.

920
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:23,980
Why is it doing this?

921
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:25,820
Why is it doing this?

922
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:59,340
Where are the lights?

923
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,420
Wrong way.

924
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,059
I'll get it.

925
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:03,559
Okay.

926
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:10,019
Okay, I'm going.

927
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:12,730
I have the gas.

928
00:51:13,289 --> 00:51:16,909
Ignition.

929
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,500
It's a battery.

930
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,619
You need the battery.

931
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:23,119
What?

932
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:32,039
Don't run into a rock.

933
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:32,840
Don't run into a rock.

934
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,239
I'm going to use the headlights from the other car.

935
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:35,739
I find it.

936
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,860
Okay, that's not even a fart.

937
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:48,780
I can't get the funny fart joke thing,

938
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,699
but that is like you shit your pants.

939
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,210
Okay, I need the headlights.

940
00:51:55,929 --> 00:52:01,800
They don't even...

941
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,719
Okay, I thought that was just like a supernova.

942
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,150
I need the headlights.

943
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,469
Thank God.

944
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:13,190
All right.

945
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,989
I need to be able to look.

946
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:19,099
Okay.

947
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,050
I have a little bit of light here.

948
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,750
I'm going to see if there's a battery by the gas pump.

949
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,210
Battery.

950
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,679
It's green.

951
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:41,059
No, this is oil.

952
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:48,409
Seriously?

953
00:52:48,409 --> 00:52:48,909
Okay.

954
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,619
Just put this fucking thing.

955
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:55,659
Can I fit it in the car?

956
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:57,380
Can I fit the...

957
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,980
I want to take the bike with me though.

958
00:53:06,469 --> 00:53:07,750
The engine's in the house.

959
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,150
Well, then I'm just going to have to sit and wait.

960
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:19,340
What's this?

961
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:25,900
All right.

962
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,500
I should probably shouldn't be breathing that in.

963
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,559
Well, it's a paint.

964
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:30,679
It's paint.

965
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,219
I get it.

966
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:34,260
It's paint.

967
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,659
Right.

968
00:53:34,659 --> 00:53:35,159
Okay.

969
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:49,130
This isn't...

970
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,570
We're just not doing anything.

971
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,940
Somebody just gave a shitload of subs.

972
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,179
That's 59 community subs from Red Zed Rider.

973
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,739
Thanks for the nearly 60 fucking subs, dude.

974
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,610
That's insane.

975
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,789
Thank you, Red.

976
00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:09,670
Holy shit.

977
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,309
We also had a bunch of donations too that came in that were huge.

978
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:20,579
What's that?

979
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,860
Is this it?

980
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:31,719
I just can't see anything.

981
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,079
Oh shit.

982
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:35,590
Like it doesn't turn the lights on in the house.

983
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,320
Oh man.

984
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,199
We're going to be fine now.

985
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,659
Oh god.

986
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:41,929
Is this it?

987
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:42,570
I think I found it.

988
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:45,340
This is definitely like a bike engine or something.

989
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:46,940
Yeah, absolutely.

990
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,340
What is this?

991
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,900
A bike engine?

992
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:49,500
It's a bike engine.

993
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,050
Pick it up.

994
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:12,139
I'm going to lean this against the house.

995
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,460
Get in and close the door!

996
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,960
Get in!

997
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:28,900
Drive.

998
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,460
Drive backwards.

999
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:30,969
Drive.

1000
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:39,420
Okay, I got him.

1001
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:40,539
I got him.

1002
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:40,940
I got him.

1003
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,340
I got him.

1004
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,940
Is it it?

1005
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:53,940
Okay.

1006
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,820
I don't hear any more noise.

1007
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,070
Okay.

1008
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:00,150
Is it weird if I just want to sit here until the sun comes up?

1009
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,190
What if I just don't want to do anything?

1010
00:56:03,909 --> 00:56:04,869
I'm safe in my car.

1011
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:08,519
It's like lightning, right?

1012
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:12,760
When you're in your car, if lightning strikes your car, you're going to be fine.

1013
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,980
You're protected in the car.

1014
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:17,539
I don't know if that was a lie that my parents would tell me

1015
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,059
because I was terrified when we were driving around.

1016
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:19,940
There was thunderstorms.

1017
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,980
Is that true?

1018
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:28,699
It's the safest place of all.

1019
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:34,869
Yeah.

1020
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:35,429
Ow.

1021
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:40,139
I'm a gamer wart.

1022
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:40,539
Sleep.

1023
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:42,500
Oh, I can sleep.

1024
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:55,610
I think it's huge.

1025
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:55,929
Nice.

1026
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,460
Red, Zed gave another 50 subs.

1027
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,460
Red, you are a fucking maniac.

1028
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,619
That's like 110 community subs.

1029
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,550
Thank you.

1030
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,190
That's insane.

1031
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,429
That is way too much money.

1032
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,590
Oh, this is shit.

1033
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:24,150
It's a ton of subs though.

1034
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,710
Thank you, dude.

1035
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:28,280
Okay.

1036
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,400
So can I put this on?

1037
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:34,090
Mount.

1038
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,559
Ooh.

1039
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:35,960
Bingo.

1040
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,070
There we go.

1041
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,579
It's been done.

1042
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:45,559
Let's do it.

1043
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:47,190
Hit the gas.

1044
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,260
Oh.

1045
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:57,900
There we go.

1046
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,309
Oh, you didn't build the engine.

1047
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,550
What?

1048
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:09,929
Look at how fast I can go now.

1049
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:13,639
Needs a battery.

1050
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:15,820
Okay.

1051
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,699
I have daylight.

1052
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:17,579
Let's go.

1053
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:22,550
Is there a battery in the house?

1054
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:34,920
I'm going to prank my friend.

1055
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:37,510
Oh, dude.

1056
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,789
Did you see what happened in your front seat?

1057
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:44,980
Somebody shit on it.

1058
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,099
No, this is not real.

1059
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:48,019
That's like the plastic poop stuff.

1060
00:58:48,019 --> 00:58:50,500
Like his friend didn't squat down and shit in his front seat.

1061
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,739
Hey, dude.

1062
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,420
Look, there's shit on it.

1063
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,460
Did you just do that?

1064
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,820
Yeah, I did.

1065
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,239
Battery.

1066
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:08,119
Give me a battery.

1067
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,409
Let me see one.

1068
00:59:10,969 --> 00:59:12,920
Look, I want to take this bike there with me.

1069
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,059
I see it.

1070
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:21,940
No, you don't.

1071
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,139
You do not see it.

1072
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:29,619
Remember the headlight.

1073
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:39,460
Okay.

1074
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,500
Let me do what I was going to do before.

1075
00:59:41,139 --> 00:59:42,260
How much gas does this car have?

1076
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,920
Where's the gas tank?

1077
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,409
Where's the gas tank?

1078
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:55,559
Is that in the trunk?

1079
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:02,860
Is this an electric car?

1080
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:08,179
Fuel tank empty.

1081
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:10,019
Well, what the hell are you talking about, man?

1082
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:11,380
That's the weirdest place.

1083
01:00:12,179 --> 01:00:12,949
All right.

1084
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:13,349
Let's go.

1085
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:16,090
Fill it up.

1086
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:23,380
Fill up the tank.

1087
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:32,869
Is this all the gas that was in here?

1088
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:46,409
What is that?

1089
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,619
Oh, right.

1090
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,219
This is perfect.

1091
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:06,889
3.9 ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined, water, water.

1092
01:01:07,449 --> 01:01:08,489
What are you talking about?

1093
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:10,099
Derma, don't, don't.

1094
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,900
Omega, well, please don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1095
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,739
It's a gas.

1096
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:22,619
No, it's not.

1097
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:23,579
It's water.

1098
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,539
Why does it have water in here?

1099
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:33,559
I have a water meter on the right.

1100
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:47,050
Peak hydration.

1101
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:05,989
I'm just a running fountain.

1102
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:08,070
Drinking and peeing at the same time.

1103
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,179
All right.

1104
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:11,659
That was cool.

1105
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,090
Now what?

1106
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:18,489
Oh, right.

1107
01:02:18,489 --> 01:02:18,809
Gas.

1108
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:20,170
This thing's got gas now.

1109
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,429
This thing's...

1110
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:23,829
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,989
Right.

1112
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:24,789
This is missing a tire.

1113
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:25,989
That car is way better anyways.

1114
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:26,789
All right.

1115
01:02:26,789 --> 01:02:27,190
Let's take...

1116
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,510
Wait.

1117
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,869
Let me get the sponge so I can clean it.

1118
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,739
Make, make, make, make.

1119
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:33,059
Close this.

1120
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:33,940
I want to clean this car.

1121
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:40,519
I think this is...

1122
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:40,679
Okay.

1123
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:44,820
This is a good...

1124
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,139
Okay.

1125
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:45,619
Never mind.

1126
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:47,460
It's not the sponge.

1127
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,820
Why did I not take the sponge?

1128
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:56,619
What a sick asshole would you be if you were doing that?

1129
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:01,320
Just rubbing a gold bar all over your car.

1130
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,179
What are you...

1131
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:03,579
Oh, fuck it.

1132
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,460
Are you a leprechaun?

1133
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:10,099
I want to take that with me too.

1134
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,780
Let's paint it red.

1135
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:19,849
Oh, I hate it.

1136
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:20,329
I don't like it.

1137
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:20,650
I hate it.

1138
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:21,449
I want another one.

1139
01:03:21,449 --> 01:03:23,940
Look on the roof.

1140
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,659
What?

1141
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:27,289
What color is this?

1142
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:30,150
Blue.

1143
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,389
Yep.

1144
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:44,599
Tilt.

1145
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:45,239
How do I tilt it?

1146
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:51,909
This is going to look sick.

1147
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,780
Stop grabbing it.

1148
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,159
Let go of the...

1149
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:04,360
Why am I magnetic?

1150
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:15,480
Oh, it looks good.

1151
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,449
Don't you think it looks good?

1152
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:18,840
Chat.

1153
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,480
I hate chat.

1154
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,440
Don't you think it looks good?

1155
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,079
Chat.

1156
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:39,210
Look.

1157
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,849
All I care about is taking the pictures from this side.

1158
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:43,059
It's okay.

1159
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:43,460
It don't work.

1160
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:44,980
Guys, it's a Craigslist car.

1161
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:52,309
I take the pictures from this angle, this angle, this angle, this angle, and this angle.

1162
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:53,829
You don't see the whole other side of the car.

1163
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:56,710
There's fucking dense scratches like smeared shit all over.

1164
01:04:56,710 --> 01:05:00,949
It doesn't matter.

1165
01:05:00,949 --> 01:05:02,070
Half the car could be missing.

1166
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:04,179
All right.

1167
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:04,980
This thing's ready to move.

1168
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,050
There's no back seat.

1169
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,230
No back seat.

1170
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:13,989
Dudes.

1171
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:16,949
How are we going to take our diesel?

1172
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,429
To start the engine, climb the...

1173
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,099
What are you doing?

1174
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:31,099
Start the moped.

1175
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:33,260
Climb on by looking at the seat and press the E key.

1176
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,699
Press I to switch on the ignition.

1177
01:05:34,699 --> 01:05:36,940
Press space to lift the kick then hold W.

1178
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,230
Climb on.

1179
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:40,949
Press E.

1180
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:44,230
Press I to switch on the ignition.

1181
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:46,469
Press space to lift the kick then hold W.

1182
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:48,309
That's what I'm doing.

1183
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:56,440
Okay.

1184
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:56,920
Press E.

1185
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:57,880
Okay.

1186
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,760
Press I.

1187
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,539
Hold W.

1188
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:01,179
See?

1189
01:06:01,179 --> 01:06:03,699
Doesn't matter.

1190
01:06:03,699 --> 01:06:05,260
Kickstand is up.

1191
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,260
Doesn't matter.

1192
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:16,070
And yeah, I need like a battery or something.

1193
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:16,869
All right.

1194
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:17,670
I got to take this with me though.

1195
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,429
I won't eventually use this.

1196
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:21,289
Let's pick this up.

1197
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:22,809
Let's try to get this somehow in this car.

1198
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:26,230
Take the battery out of the car.

1199
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,880
The car battery.

1200
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,320
Oh shit.

1201
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,119
Wait.

1202
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,480
I got to sleep in my car first.

1203
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,889
Too late.

1204
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:46,409
I can't sleep yet.

1205
01:06:46,409 --> 01:06:46,969
Why?

1206
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:52,010
Get out of the car, are you buffoon?

1207
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,210
What do you mean get out of the car?

1208
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,889
This is the only place I feel safe.

1209
01:06:54,889 --> 01:07:07,159
All right.

1210
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:10,119
That could have been me in the chair here like in real life.

1211
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:29,289
Hey Jeremy.

1212
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:29,610
Hey.

1213
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:30,090
Hey.

1214
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:30,570
Oh shit.

1215
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,449
There's a person.

1216
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:32,570
No, don't come in yet.

1217
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:32,889
Hey.

1218
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:34,090
What's up, man?

1219
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,809
I'm just chilling here.

1220
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:37,690
Don't come in the car though.

1221
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:39,210
Just stand out there for like another five minutes.

1222
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:39,769
You smoke, right?

1223
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:40,570
Smoke a cigarette.

1224
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:47,210
Come on.

1225
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,460
Go to bed.

1226
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:50,739
Adjust your mirrors.

1227
01:07:50,739 --> 01:07:52,949
What do I need to adjust the mirror for?

1228
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:58,710
Until I get to look at me.

1229
01:08:06,139 --> 01:08:18,010
That's all I can do right now.

1230
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,380
I can't sleep yet.

1231
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:26,710
Are there other people?

1232
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:33,050
I'm going to sleep with the lights on too.

1233
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:37,880
The doors are locked, right?

1234
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,560
Nobody can come in here.

1235
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:53,079
How can I not sleep yet?

1236
01:08:53,079 --> 01:08:54,680
It's pitch black outside.

1237
01:08:54,680 --> 01:09:03,220
Please don't murder your battery.

1238
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:09,079
Oh shit.

1239
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:10,039
Oh shit.

1240
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:36,039
Almost time to sleep.

1241
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:39,640
I see it.

1242
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,640
What do you see?

1243
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:48,579
What do I even look like?

1244
01:09:48,579 --> 01:09:51,880
It's fucking coming.

1245
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,520
It's coming.

1246
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,039
I'm in my car.

1247
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:54,520
I'm safe.

1248
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,800
Nothing can hurt you in your car.

1249
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:04,199
I got the lights on over here.

1250
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:10,149
I'm fine.

1251
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,789
Aliens.

1252
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:20,869
What's that?

1253
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:21,829
Is that what you're talking about?

1254
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:22,550
What is that?

1255
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:32,739
It's like a meteor.

1256
01:10:32,739 --> 01:10:43,140
All right.

1257
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:57,130
Time to sleep.

1258
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,689
Okay.

1259
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:03,260
That's what I look like.

1260
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,920
Wow.

1261
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,880
That's cool.

1262
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,060
You can actually see a head moving around.

1263
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:08,220
All right.

1264
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:08,779
What was I doing?

1265
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:09,180
Battery.

1266
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:09,659
Right.

1267
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:23,500
Stupid back engine.

1268
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,939
Wait a minute.

1269
01:11:25,939 --> 01:11:28,260
If I take the whole engine and put it in that car,

1270
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,939
won't this have full gas?

1271
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:39,060
Is that a battery?

1272
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,729
What is this?

1273
01:11:42,729 --> 01:11:43,850
Coolant tank.

1274
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:46,229
Where's the battery?

1275
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:56,500
This guy doesn't have a battery?

1276
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,640
Guys, I don't think batteries are in the game.

1277
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:08,380
There's no such thing as a battery in the game.

1278
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:09,979
Bike is already ready.

1279
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:10,140
All right.

1280
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:16,250
Let's just take it with us.

1281
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,449
Can I take the seat out?

1282
01:12:17,449 --> 01:12:27,859
Did I do that?

1283
01:12:27,859 --> 01:12:28,340
Hold on.

1284
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:31,319
Did I do that in my sleep?

1285
01:12:40,779 --> 01:12:41,100
Why?

1286
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,439
Just drive.

1287
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:48,409
Hold on.

1288
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:49,289
I have to close that.

1289
01:12:49,289 --> 01:13:05,350
That's not going to work.

1290
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:09,609
Or is it?

1291
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:24,600
What's wrong with this?

1292
01:13:25,479 --> 01:13:36,460
I didn't put water in here.

1293
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:39,989
What do you mean water?

1294
01:13:39,989 --> 01:13:42,600
I did not put water in there.

1295
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,800
The thing is the tank is open.

1296
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,199
Hold on.

1297
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,060
Holy shit.

1298
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:46,939
There's an animal.

1299
01:13:46,939 --> 01:14:03,960
I didn't close the gas tank.

1300
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,659
Okay.

1301
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:06,220
We're good.

1302
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:40,819
Why?

1303
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:42,680
I didn't fill it with water.

1304
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,199
I drank the water.

1305
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:44,439
Look.

1306
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:48,359
100% gas.

1307
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,699
Nothing else.

1308
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:50,420
See?

1309
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:55,659
What happened?

1310
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:56,779
I need oil?

1311
01:14:56,779 --> 01:14:58,579
Oh, no.

1312
01:14:58,579 --> 01:14:59,300
What?

1313
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:02,890
Check the oil.

1314
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:03,130
Fuck.

1315
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:14,779
All right.

1316
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:15,819
Where's the oil?

1317
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:25,399
That's the gas tank.

1318
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:27,079
This car is freaking me out.

1319
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:29,449
Where's the actual oil?

1320
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:31,189
Isn't it underneath?

1321
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:35,340
You need 3% oil.

1322
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:41,340
3% oil in the tank.

1323
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:51,050
Is it for real?

1324
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:56,939
Like a lawn mower.

1325
01:15:56,939 --> 01:15:57,500
No.

1326
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:58,220
That's gas.

1327
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,579
I thought this is a gas tank.

1328
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:08,619
3% oil?

1329
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:09,659
Didn't do anything.

1330
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:18,579
That's gas?

1331
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:19,460
This is gas?

1332
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:22,140
It says car oil.

1333
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:27,829
Give me fucking oil.

1334
01:16:27,829 --> 01:16:28,869
Who's got oil?

1335
01:16:28,869 --> 01:16:36,579
Is this oil?

1336
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:44,180
Oil?

1337
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,050
Huh?

1338
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:47,369
I can't.

1339
01:16:48,329 --> 01:16:50,779
Where's the indicator?

1340
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:51,340
Oil.

1341
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,060
Go.

1342
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:56,090
All right.

1343
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,050
3% oil.

1344
01:16:57,609 --> 01:17:06,229
What's going on?

1345
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:08,489
I'm not even putting it in the car.

1346
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,109
Is that OK?

1347
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:32,659
Is that OK?

1348
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:33,539
Just drive.

1349
01:17:33,539 --> 01:17:33,859
Hold on.

1350
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:34,659
I need to close this.

1351
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:37,479
All right.

1352
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:37,880
We're good.

1353
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:39,079
Let's go.

1354
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:40,899
Long drive.

1355
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:52,340
Nice.

1356
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:52,579
All right.

1357
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:53,619
I'm on the right track now.

1358
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:08,119
Wrong way.

1359
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:20,779
I care more about the mirror.

1360
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,220
This was a face cam.

1361
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,500
What do you mean?

1362
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,460
Am I going the wrong way?

1363
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:30,420
I don't remember what side this was on.

1364
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,560
Guys, I don't know what the hell's going on.

1365
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:43,510
This is the right way.

1366
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,300
Hey.

1367
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,979
Thanks, Jack.

1368
01:18:47,979 --> 01:18:48,460
Appreciate it.

1369
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:01,109
Bike needed oil.

1370
01:19:01,109 --> 01:19:01,510
It's OK.

1371
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:02,789
We'll get another one.

1372
01:19:02,789 --> 01:19:05,979
This car sucks.

1373
01:19:05,979 --> 01:19:16,170
Hey, guys.

1374
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:19,050
Don't ever take your eyes off the road.

1375
01:19:19,609 --> 01:19:27,460
Hey, based 20.

1376
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,420
Thanks for the five.

1377
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:29,460
Just need to be able to use it up.

1378
01:19:43,319 --> 01:19:44,520
Your face cam in the mirror.

1379
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:44,760
No.

1380
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:46,039
No.

1381
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:46,279
No.

1382
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,079
No.

1383
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:49,380
No.

1384
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:52,970
What's that mean?

1385
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:55,210
Is the car too hot?

1386
01:19:56,010 --> 01:20:01,159
Why do I have a minigun cooldown meter?

1387
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:01,800
I don't understand.

1388
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,159
What's that for?

1389
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:08,630
I'm going on over here.

1390
01:20:09,189 --> 01:20:17,239
It means everything is fine.

1391
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:17,960
OK, cool.

1392
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:21,210
This is loud as hell.

1393
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:21,930
Turn this shit down.

1394
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,909
All right, we're good.

1395
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:27,659
Do I need water?

1396
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:31,670
How far have I even gone?

1397
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,630
Is there a way?

1398
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,229
The alignment of this car is so wrong.

1399
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,350
It's just pulling to the right.

1400
01:20:36,069 --> 01:20:42,949
I'm just being ripped to the right side.

1401
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,090
Spit in the engine.

1402
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:59,260
Hey, German on 85 here.

1403
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:16,470
I'm still alive.

1404
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,069
I'm still alive.

1405
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:18,390
OK.

1406
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,319
OK, let's just get this shit out of me.

1407
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:26,680
Can the car still drive?

1408
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,659
It's all right.

1409
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:32,380
I'll be OK.

1410
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:34,579
Oh, boy.

1411
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:35,220
Was somebody...

1412
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:37,060
Yuck.

1413
01:21:38,659 --> 01:21:39,859
OK, we're OK.

1414
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:45,859
Put this back on.

1415
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:47,939
Wait, put it in neutral and roll it back.

1416
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,220
I lost a mirror, but who cares?

1417
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:53,399
Let's move it back.

1418
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,649
Did the engine just fall out of the car?

1419
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:00,699
Oh, shit.

1420
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:01,979
It's all messed up now.

1421
01:22:02,539 --> 01:22:06,010
I don't need this.

1422
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:06,329
OK.

1423
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,420
Stop moving.

1424
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:10,979
Stop.

1425
01:22:10,979 --> 01:22:11,220
No.

1426
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,939
No, I don't want to kick it.

1427
01:22:19,029 --> 01:22:20,390
It's going to hit the other pole.

1428
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:22,979
No, no.

1429
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:23,619
Don't be...

1430
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:24,100
Thank you.

1431
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,199
Wait a minute.

1432
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:27,579
Keep going.

1433
01:22:27,579 --> 01:22:27,979
Keep going.

1434
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:28,460
Keep driving.

1435
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:28,859
Keep driving.

1436
01:22:28,859 --> 01:22:29,260
Keep driving.

1437
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:29,659
Keep driving.

1438
01:22:29,659 --> 01:22:31,100
Hit that motherfucker so he doesn't kill me.

1439
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:33,100
Get him.

1440
01:22:37,989 --> 01:22:38,789
Oh, my God.

1441
01:22:38,789 --> 01:22:39,670
There's a guy.

1442
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:40,229
OK, hold on.

1443
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:41,270
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1444
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,670
I'm fine.

1445
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,069
Where's the gun?

1446
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:42,789
I have a gun, don't I?

1447
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:44,390
I didn't use the gun.

1448
01:22:48,619 --> 01:22:49,899
R plus mouse.

1449
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:50,140
What?

1450
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:52,310
Brake barrel.

1451
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:52,789
What do I do?

1452
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,550
R plus mouse.

1453
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:02,789
There's no bullets in this.

1454
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:08,569
How do I use these?

1455
01:23:13,079 --> 01:23:13,960
Holy shit, I did it.

1456
01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:21,340
What the fuck?

1457
01:23:21,899 --> 01:23:26,090
OK, reload.

1458
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:32,760
He's still alive.

1459
01:23:45,529 --> 01:23:46,170
Fuck you.

1460
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:46,489
All right.

1461
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:47,130
Go, go, go.

1462
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,090
Where's the car?

1463
01:23:48,090 --> 01:24:03,079
I have 198 shots to fucking kill it.

1464
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:03,640
God.

1465
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,039
OK.

1466
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:04,840
Where's my car?

1467
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:08,260
Come on, I don't have a tire.

1468
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:09,859
I don't have a tire.

1469
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,640
It's getting dark.

1470
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,520
I can sleep in the car.

1471
01:24:13,159 --> 01:24:17,989
Oh, thank God.

1472
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:18,869
Get me in.

1473
01:24:18,869 --> 01:24:20,310
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

1474
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,949
Where's the front?

1475
01:24:20,949 --> 01:24:21,510
I can't tell.

1476
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:23,670
Where's the front door?

1477
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:24,550
I don't care where it is.

1478
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:25,029
Just get in.

1479
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,109
Get in, get in, get in.

1480
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:28,229
Sit, sit.

1481
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:33,220
There are no lights.

1482
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:35,720
It's OK.

1483
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,439
I'm going to be fine.

1484
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:45,670
The car is rolling.

1485
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:45,989
OK.

1486
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:47,479
OK.

1487
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:52,659
So, I got oil.

1488
01:24:52,659 --> 01:24:54,279
I got...

1489
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:55,560
Can we stop the car?

1490
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:01,960
Oh, boy.

1491
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:02,760
Oh, boy.

1492
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,699
I got to push this.

1493
01:25:05,699 --> 01:25:08,039
Why is this shit in here?

1494
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,399
Why do I keep shitting in my car?

1495
01:25:09,399 --> 01:25:12,739
It doesn't make any...

1496
01:25:12,739 --> 01:25:13,460
All right.

1497
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:14,899
I've got to push this thing.

1498
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:22,170
How do I hold on to it and push and steer?

1499
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:43,430
That works.

1500
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:54,739
Get me in the car.

1501
01:25:54,739 --> 01:25:55,380
Get me in.

1502
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:58,180
I just need to push it so I can steer it.

1503
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:09,859
OK.

1504
01:26:09,859 --> 01:26:10,659
Get it back on the road.

1505
01:26:10,659 --> 01:26:11,460
That's all I care about.

1506
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:37,189
The handbrake.

1507
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:37,829
Put it in...

1508
01:26:37,829 --> 01:26:46,899
What?

1509
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:47,699
It's in park.

1510
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,289
Oh, fuck.

1511
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:51,609
OK.

1512
01:26:51,609 --> 01:26:58,979
Then I got to get in while it's still going.

1513
01:26:58,979 --> 01:27:00,500
You don't think I'll be able to do this shit?

1514
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:05,619
Oh, yes, I will.

1515
01:27:05,619 --> 01:27:06,260
Hey.

1516
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:11,399
All right.

1517
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:12,279
Where's the tire?

1518
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:15,380
No, no, no, no.

1519
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,699
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1520
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:18,340
Get back over here.

1521
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:23,659
Come here.

1522
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,739
No.

1523
01:27:26,739 --> 01:27:28,100
Making it go faster.

1524
01:27:31,659 --> 01:27:33,180
I can't, dude.

1525
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:33,899
Fuck this.

1526
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,920
I'm going to be chasing this.

1527
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:39,560
Just restart?

1528
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,279
I don't have to yet.

1529
01:27:40,279 --> 01:27:40,760
I'm going to...

1530
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,159
Don't worry.

1531
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,560
I didn't go that far from that gas station.

1532
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,119
I'll be OK.

1533
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:48,869
I had to look in the fucking rear view mirror and be a dick.

1534
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,420
OK.

1535
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:00,949
Brake.

1536
01:28:00,949 --> 01:28:01,590
I'm ready.

1537
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:02,550
Here we go.

1538
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,149
Push and steer.

1539
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:08,039
Where was it?

1540
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:08,600
Come on.

1541
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,319
Push and steer.

1542
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:21,300
All right.

1543
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,180
Which was the right way?

1544
01:28:26,739 --> 01:28:27,779
This way, right?

1545
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:28,739
Or was the car accident?

1546
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:39,420
Yeah.

1547
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:39,979
Somebody just said it.

1548
01:28:39,979 --> 01:28:41,100
I can just Flintstone this thing.

1549
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:41,579
I'll be fine.

1550
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:53,000
Um, why did that happen?

1551
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,329
Because I stepped on a rock.

1552
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:03,449
Is that really what that was?

1553
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,449
I tripped on a rock.

1554
01:29:05,449 --> 01:29:06,329
It's OK.

1555
01:29:06,329 --> 01:29:08,010
It's going to end up in the right spot anyways.

1556
01:29:08,649 --> 01:29:10,600
All right.

1557
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,479
Can I just shoot it?

1558
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:33,289
Stop.

1559
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:34,090
What do you mean stop?

1560
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,369
I have to.

1561
01:29:35,369 --> 01:29:39,180
I jumped to it again and...

1562
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:41,029
Perfect.

1563
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:46,149
I have to clean the blood off this thing.

1564
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:50,420
Oh, shit.

1565
01:29:50,420 --> 01:30:08,180
There's one of those antelopes.

1566
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,779
I'm so scared it's going to run at me.

1567
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:28,060
I have to do this.

1568
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,420
Otherwise, they're going to kill me.

1569
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:36,039
All right.

1570
01:30:36,039 --> 01:30:36,680
No, they're running away.

1571
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,399
We're fine.

1572
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:48,539
Back to the road.

1573
01:30:48,539 --> 01:30:49,659
It's self-defense.

1574
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:59,399
It's just running down behind you.

1575
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:02,039
No, I'm good.

1576
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:02,680
I'm good.

1577
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,159
I'm good.

1578
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,420
All right.

1579
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:06,539
We're getting back to the road.

1580
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,600
Does a spare tire in the trunk always bring a spare tire?

1581
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,079
I know.

1582
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:13,720
Exactly.

1583
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:16,840
Always bring a spare.

1584
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:22,300
Even if you're going down the street or behind you in real life.

1585
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,760
Oh, the dog back there.

1586
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:30,500
I've made it back to the road.

1587
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,630
OK.

1588
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,510
Now it's just a question of just be careful here.

1589
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,229
Don't be an idiot.

1590
01:31:36,869 --> 01:31:46,260
Put it in brake.

1591
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:51,189
Get that spare tire.

1592
01:31:51,189 --> 01:31:51,430
Yeah.

1593
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,949
Gold sure is worth a lot right now, isn't it?

1594
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:56,630
What can I do with gold right now?

1595
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:04,899
I could be the richest man on all of the earth.

1596
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,420
If I don't have a spare tire, I'm dead.

1597
01:32:19,319 --> 01:32:19,640
OK.

1598
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:39,579
Now what?

1599
01:32:39,579 --> 01:32:41,340
I just have to make it to a gas station.

1600
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:41,899
I'll be OK.

1601
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:49,350
I don't even know what happened.

1602
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:50,149
What happened?

1603
01:32:55,979 --> 01:32:56,380
What happened?

1604
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,180
I didn't do anything.

1605
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:57,819
I just ran.

1606
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:04,329
I'm better off just walking.

1607
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:09,909
Just abandon the car.

1608
01:33:09,909 --> 01:33:10,710
I can't.

1609
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:11,189
I have to.

1610
01:33:13,239 --> 01:33:13,560
All right.

1611
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,800
At least give me at least give me the gold bar.

1612
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,220
Restart Roy.

1613
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,659
No, I'm not restarting yet.

1614
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:23,000
Not yet.

1615
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,779
I'm not done yet.

1616
01:33:25,779 --> 01:33:26,340
Let's go.

1617
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:26,500
Get.

1618
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:40,380
Shit.

1619
01:33:45,979 --> 01:33:46,939
Where's the fucking road?

1620
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:47,899
Where's the road?

1621
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:49,460
What's on the front seat?

1622
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,560
Just restart.

1623
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,800
No, but it's I'm so close to the gas station.

1624
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:11,770
I can feel it.

1625
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:13,369
Look, I'll just do a Mario Kart skip.

1626
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:25,850
All right.

1627
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:26,090
All right.

1628
01:34:26,090 --> 01:34:26,329
Fine.

1629
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:26,970
Fine.

1630
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:27,369
Fine.

1631
01:34:27,369 --> 01:34:28,170
Fine.

1632
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:28,729
Fine.

1633
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:34,100
There's the road.

1634
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:52,260
Road's right there.

1635
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,779
Oh, oh my God.

1636
01:34:53,779 --> 01:34:55,460
He's starting to believe this is.

1637
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:56,500
No, I'm not.

1638
01:34:56,500 --> 01:34:56,899
I don't.

1639
01:34:57,779 --> 01:34:58,659
I just want to.

1640
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:02,600
I just want to get to another gas station.

1641
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,640
Use the save state.

1642
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,840
I don't have save state.

1643
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:11,289
It doesn't have an engine.

1644
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,300
Odd Watchers skip.

1645
01:35:15,739 --> 01:35:16,060
Don't.

1646
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,899
You stay right where you are.

1647
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:22,279
Open the hood.

1648
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:27,270
If I open the hood, I can go faster.

1649
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:29,289
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1650
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:30,810
If I just take this whole thing apart,

1651
01:35:30,810 --> 01:35:31,850
but leave the wheels on,

1652
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,289
will I be able to run faster with it?

1653
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:35,020
Is that for real?

1654
01:35:39,939 --> 01:35:41,460
Like if I just push a skeleton,

1655
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:42,260
will that be okay?

1656
01:35:42,979 --> 01:35:52,250
I'm not going to mess with anything right now.

1657
01:35:54,409 --> 01:35:55,689
No, not messing with anything.

1658
01:35:56,250 --> 01:36:02,779
Just leave the car.

1659
01:36:02,779 --> 01:36:04,380
There'll be another one at the next station.

1660
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:05,020
Yeah, I'm running.

1661
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:11,699
Turn the radio on.

1662
01:36:14,779 --> 01:36:15,100
Okay.

1663
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,579
No, don't tell me to do that.

1664
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,460
This is the correct way.

1665
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:20,939
Yeah, I'm good.

1666
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:30,789
It's not even going that slow.

1667
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:33,350
I'm probably running like 15, 20 miles per hour.

1668
01:36:33,989 --> 01:36:41,909
I'm just going to walk.

1669
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:43,430
I'm just going to walk, whatever.

1670
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:45,819
I'm just going to walk.

1671
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,750
It's too fucked up.

1672
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,710
It's too hard to do that.

1673
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:52,949
Hey, maybe it'll meet me there.

1674
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:56,020
What about the gold bar?

1675
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,180
Money is useless in the apocalypse, dude.

1676
01:36:58,739 --> 01:37:03,180
That thing was so cool too.

1677
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:05,369
It's all right.

1678
01:37:05,369 --> 01:37:06,090
I have my gun.

1679
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:09,590
I'm ready for anything.

1680
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:13,720
I drank a shitload of water.

1681
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,119
I'm fine.

1682
01:37:27,239 --> 01:37:28,199
Get to the homeland.

1683
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:32,090
There'll probably be one very shortly.

1684
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:34,470
A long walk.

1685
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:37,529
Restart, reload.

1686
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:38,890
I think I'm in too deep right now.

1687
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:39,449
I don't think I can.

1688
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,279
All right, if there's not a gas station

1689
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,199
within the next 60 seconds, I will.

1690
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:56,010
If there's not a gas station on the horizon in 60 seconds,

1691
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,029
I will restart.

1692
01:37:59,029 --> 01:38:00,229
Reload the gun, they mean.

1693
01:38:00,869 --> 01:38:02,680
All right, I got it.

1694
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,689
Why did I have to look into the rear view mirror?

1695
01:38:21,899 --> 01:38:23,100
This game is really fun though.

1696
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:24,300
It's just stupid.

1697
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:31,140
Okay, hold on.

1698
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,520
Is there a gas station on the horizon?

1699
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:44,069
Hold on.

1700
01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:45,750
This is going to load up here in a second.

1701
01:38:50,979 --> 01:38:51,779
I got a hundred and nine.

1702
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:52,020
Can I wait?

1703
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,979
Can I sleep on the ground?

1704
01:38:53,539 --> 01:39:03,029
Turn up the draw distance.

1705
01:39:03,029 --> 01:39:03,829
You'll be able to tell.

1706
01:39:06,569 --> 01:39:07,449
Kill for food.

1707
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:41,449
Oh, I'm making it to the gas station.

1708
01:39:41,449 --> 01:39:41,689
Fuck you.

1709
01:39:41,689 --> 01:39:42,649
I don't even care.

1710
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:59,670
I'll sleep on the goddamn ground for all like it.

1711
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:01,340
Wait a minute.

1712
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:02,380
What's that down there?

1713
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,180
Is that a tire?

1714
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:04,220
Is that the car?

1715
01:40:04,220 --> 01:40:06,899
What is that?

1716
01:40:06,899 --> 01:40:12,649
Is that blood?

1717
01:40:12,649 --> 01:40:14,180
What's that over there?

1718
01:40:14,739 --> 01:40:15,539
What is that?

1719
01:40:15,539 --> 01:40:23,529
Come on.

1720
01:40:23,529 --> 01:40:25,289
Give me a gas station like right now.

1721
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:28,819
Come on.

1722
01:40:32,199 --> 01:40:32,760
No.

1723
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,319
All right.

1724
01:40:33,319 --> 01:40:33,800
Fine.

1725
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:34,439
I know.

1726
01:40:34,439 --> 01:40:36,039
But that's like the whole point of the game

1727
01:40:36,039 --> 01:40:38,359
is not to just be like a restart Randy.

1728
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:49,050
No, I got this.

1729
01:40:49,050 --> 01:40:49,369
I do.

1730
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:50,250
Okay.

1731
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:51,770
After this.

1732
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:52,170
Okay.

1733
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:54,010
One, two, three.

1734
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,609
After the fourth street light,

1735
01:40:55,609 --> 01:40:57,449
if there's no gas station on the horizon,

1736
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,180
I will restart.

1737
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,800
There's one.

1738
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,520
Here comes two.

1739
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:15,260
What's that noise?

1740
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:19,460
Somebody has one of those toys

1741
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,579
that they're turning upside down though.

1742
01:41:35,899 --> 01:41:36,699
Donald Trump?

1743
01:41:43,449 --> 01:41:43,930
Excuse me.

1744
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:48,699
All right.

1745
01:41:48,699 --> 01:41:49,260
There's two.

1746
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:54,939
Here comes three.

1747
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:03,100
No.

1748
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:05,420
I don't want to restart.

1749
01:42:05,979 --> 01:42:07,899
No, no, no, no.

1750
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:12,579
Whoops.

1751
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:15,140
There's two.

1752
01:42:15,699 --> 01:42:29,140
Don't ever restart.

1753
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,939
What's this?

1754
01:42:31,899 --> 01:42:32,460
Oh, shit.

1755
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,020
Evidence.

1756
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:34,140
I think this is where the car was.

1757
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:38,010
Wait, is that my...

1758
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:38,649
What is that?

1759
01:42:38,649 --> 01:42:52,390
I think we're close.

1760
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:54,310
Do your Donald Trump as a cat again.

1761
01:42:55,659 --> 01:42:57,420
No, I don't even know what I did.

1762
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:00,090
Look at all the resident sleepers.

1763
01:43:02,569 --> 01:43:03,050
It's like...

1764
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,470
I know.

1765
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:06,710
But look, I'm making progress.

1766
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:07,189
Trust me.

1767
01:43:07,189 --> 01:43:07,590
I know.

1768
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:09,109
I'm just trying to make progress.

1769
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:11,579
Look.

1770
01:43:11,579 --> 01:43:12,140
Okay.

1771
01:43:12,140 --> 01:43:12,619
Let me...

1772
01:43:12,619 --> 01:43:13,899
I gotta be upfront with you.

1773
01:43:13,899 --> 01:43:15,979
The last stream I did was Super Monkey Ball.

1774
01:43:16,619 --> 01:43:19,819
And I save stated restart Randy'd

1775
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,659
six or seven hundred times.

1776
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:23,020
I gotta...

1777
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:24,539
We gotta go to the other side here for a little bit.

1778
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:35,539
Let's just do it three times this time.

1779
01:43:35,539 --> 01:43:35,779
Okay.

1780
01:43:35,779 --> 01:43:36,180
Hold on.

1781
01:43:36,819 --> 01:43:39,140
What is that?

1782
01:43:39,699 --> 01:43:40,699
I'm looking for...

1783
01:43:42,579 --> 01:43:42,979
Whatever.

1784
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:49,420
I need the light.

1785
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:56,060
Fuck.

1786
01:43:58,359 --> 01:43:58,760
No.

1787
01:44:04,859 --> 01:44:08,970
Pretty good in-game noises, don't you think?

1788
01:44:22,659 --> 01:44:22,979
Okay.

1789
01:44:23,539 --> 01:44:24,180
All right.

1790
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:25,300
Okay, PUBG.

1791
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:25,779
Okay.

1792
01:44:25,779 --> 01:44:27,460
Shotgun needs a little bit of fucking tuning.

1793
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:46,789
Now, don't it?

1794
01:44:46,789 --> 01:44:48,149
Why can I not hit this thing?

1795
01:44:51,449 --> 01:44:51,770
What?

1796
01:44:52,409 --> 01:45:11,100
Okay.

1797
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:14,569
I get it.

1798
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:18,250
Just like all the people that complain about game mechanics like that,

1799
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:21,140
it's usually their own damn fault.

1800
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:23,430
I don't understand.

1801
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:24,949
Like, what's with this hit-wrench?

1802
01:45:24,949 --> 01:45:25,989
You don't have any bullets.

1803
01:45:28,539 --> 01:45:29,020
All right.

1804
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:29,899
But yeah, whatever, dude.

1805
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,020
Time that guy.

1806
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:31,739
I'll ban him.

1807
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:34,229
I don't want that person in my chat room.

1808
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:42,460
Fuck.

1809
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:43,340
Come on.

1810
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,609
I really do have to restart soon.

1811
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:46,170
If I can't...

1812
01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:50,659
It's gotta be right here.

1813
01:45:50,659 --> 01:45:50,899
Right?

1814
01:45:50,899 --> 01:45:51,539
Come on, man.

1815
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,020
This is so boring.

1816
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:55,420
Please.

1817
01:45:55,420 --> 01:45:56,220
I'm sorry.

1818
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:56,619
I know.

1819
01:45:56,619 --> 01:45:57,979
I'm working on it.

1820
01:45:57,979 --> 01:45:58,699
I'm working on it.

1821
01:45:58,699 --> 01:45:59,340
I'm working on it.

1822
01:45:59,340 --> 01:45:59,739
Trust me.

1823
01:46:00,619 --> 01:46:02,140
It's fucking Super Monkey Ball.

1824
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:03,659
I didn't fucking have to restart the...

1825
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:07,619
No, it's a mirage.

1826
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:17,750
Press F4.

1827
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:21,529
What did you just do?

1828
01:46:21,529 --> 01:46:24,260
Wait, what the hell is this?

1829
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:28,100
You can just put a camera down?

1830
01:46:36,409 --> 01:46:37,289
Why?

1831
01:46:37,289 --> 01:46:39,689
That's so stupid.

1832
01:46:39,689 --> 01:46:41,050
I love it, though.

1833
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:53,859
The vlog cam?

1834
01:46:53,859 --> 01:46:57,000
Hold on.

1835
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,720
No, no, no.

1836
01:46:58,949 --> 01:47:00,420
Now, no.

1837
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:10,220
Now it's a vlog cam.

1838
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,699
Oh, okay.

1839
01:47:10,699 --> 01:47:12,060
Here we go.

1840
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:16,979
No, I don't have time to do this.

1841
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:17,779
I don't have time to do this.

1842
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:18,659
I believe the camera there.

1843
01:47:18,659 --> 01:47:23,880
I don't have time.

1844
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,800
You want like a four-minute bit right there?

1845
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:26,600
No, no, no.

1846
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,079
I have to find my way to a gas station.

1847
01:47:29,079 --> 01:47:29,720
Look.

1848
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:30,840
I'll make everybody happy.

1849
01:47:31,399 --> 01:47:31,800
See?

1850
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:33,239
You don't even care what happens now.

1851
01:47:38,439 --> 01:47:39,880
Wait, was I drinking my own piss?

1852
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:41,340
What?

1853
01:47:41,979 --> 01:47:52,899
Am I going the right way?

1854
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:53,619
Am I going the right way?

1855
01:47:53,619 --> 01:47:54,260
Am I going the right way?

1856
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:54,979
Am I going the right way?

1857
01:47:55,619 --> 01:47:57,140
I just turned around like five times.

1858
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:57,699
I don't know.

1859
01:47:57,699 --> 01:47:59,449
Is this the right way?

1860
01:47:59,449 --> 01:48:00,569
I have no idea what's going on.

1861
01:48:00,569 --> 01:48:00,890
I don't know.

1862
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:01,689
Am I going the right way?

1863
01:48:06,170 --> 01:48:06,489
All right.

1864
01:48:06,489 --> 01:48:07,289
I mean it this time.

1865
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:08,970
I really seriously mean this.

1866
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:09,930
If I do not...

1867
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:11,369
If after this rock formation right here,

1868
01:48:11,369 --> 01:48:12,329
there's not a gas station,

1869
01:48:12,329 --> 01:48:13,050
I'm going to restart.

1870
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:30,090
Times two, ResidentSleeper.

1871
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:32,970
Just you're going to feel so much better about this.

1872
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:36,979
When I go back and there is a POG truck

1873
01:48:36,979 --> 01:48:39,220
that only spawned in this seed

1874
01:48:39,220 --> 01:48:40,500
and I found it, you're going to be like,

1875
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,579
well, I'm so glad this motherfucker didn't restart.

1876
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:44,180
You're going to be so happy.

1877
01:48:44,739 --> 01:48:46,180
You'll be like, oh my god.

1878
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,380
I was telling him restart Randy.

1879
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,819
I was going, restart Randy.

1880
01:48:48,819 --> 01:48:49,939
Andy, restart Andy.

1881
01:48:50,739 --> 01:48:53,380
And by the way, you're calling me restart Andy?

1882
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,180
Restart Randy?

1883
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,220
I haven't restarted once.

1884
01:48:57,050 --> 01:48:58,729
You call me walking Andy.

1885
01:48:58,729 --> 01:49:00,329
Walking Walter.

1886
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:01,369
You guys got it wrong.

1887
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:01,850
Come on.

1888
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:02,489
You guys Twitch chat.

1889
01:49:02,489 --> 01:49:03,449
You're supposed to know these rules.

1890
01:49:14,489 --> 01:49:14,890
Okay.

1891
01:49:14,890 --> 01:49:15,609
It's coming up.

1892
01:49:15,609 --> 01:49:16,890
I'm about to restart.

1893
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:18,359
It's going to happen.

1894
01:49:18,359 --> 01:49:19,880
I like this game though.

1895
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:20,840
I'm here for a while.

1896
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:21,640
I think this is fun.

1897
01:49:28,489 --> 01:49:29,050
Okay.

1898
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:29,770
All right.

1899
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:30,409
All right.

1900
01:49:30,409 --> 01:49:30,890
For real.

1901
01:49:31,449 --> 01:49:35,909
I know.

1902
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:37,109
I can't have like half the stream

1903
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:38,470
be me walking to a gas station.

1904
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:39,029
You're right.

1905
01:49:39,029 --> 01:49:39,909
You're right.

1906
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:40,229
Right.

1907
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,630
How do I...

1908
01:49:52,949 --> 01:49:53,909
You can.

1909
01:49:53,909 --> 01:49:55,350
Okay.

1910
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:56,069
You know what?

1911
01:49:56,069 --> 01:49:56,630
You guys got to...

1912
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:57,909
The enablers in chat,

1913
01:49:57,909 --> 01:49:59,909
they're enabling me so hard.

1914
01:49:59,909 --> 01:50:10,069
You're almost there.

1915
01:50:10,069 --> 01:50:16,810
I'm probably not.

1916
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,640
I see the gas station.

1917
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,279
Where?

1918
01:50:22,279 --> 01:50:26,060
There's no gas station yet.

1919
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:26,779
You're almost there.

1920
01:50:26,779 --> 01:50:30,460
Am I?

1921
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:31,020
It's right there.

1922
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:31,420
Right there.

1923
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:31,899
Right there.

1924
01:50:31,899 --> 01:50:32,380
Right there.

1925
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,020
Where?

1926
01:50:33,020 --> 01:50:45,899
Is that it right there?

1927
01:50:45,899 --> 01:50:49,369
Walking bus simulator.

1928
01:50:49,369 --> 01:50:50,890
Walking desert bus.

1929
01:50:50,890 --> 01:50:54,199
Now that would be a real, real game.

1930
01:50:54,199 --> 01:50:56,520
You know how people do like the desert bus thing

1931
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:57,720
and you have to do the whole thing.

1932
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,239
Imagine walking this whole thing.

1933
01:50:59,239 --> 01:51:04,859
Desert walk.

1934
01:51:04,859 --> 01:51:05,500
Yeah.

1935
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:08,840
It just saved a checkpoint.

1936
01:51:11,819 --> 01:51:12,060
All right.

1937
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:12,859
Come on, man.

1938
01:51:12,859 --> 01:51:13,260
Come on.

1939
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:14,220
I don't want to restart yet.

1940
01:51:14,220 --> 01:51:14,699
Come on.

1941
01:51:14,699 --> 01:51:15,100
Please.

1942
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:15,739
Right over here.

1943
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:17,560
Right when I turn this...

1944
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:18,359
This bank right here.

1945
01:51:18,359 --> 01:51:19,319
It's going to be right there.

1946
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:23,829
Brink the oil to go faster.

1947
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:36,840
Turns out that's a lie.

1948
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,039
That didn't do anything.

1949
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:42,300
All right.

1950
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:47,060
Are there any nutrients in oil?

1951
01:51:47,060 --> 01:51:48,890
Somebody look this up.

1952
01:51:48,890 --> 01:51:49,529
Like if...

1953
01:51:49,529 --> 01:51:50,010
If I...

1954
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:52,409
Because isn't oil like dinosaur bones ground up

1955
01:51:52,409 --> 01:51:54,170
and fossils and stuff in the ground and everything?

1956
01:51:54,970 --> 01:51:55,609
It's like all...

1957
01:51:55,609 --> 01:51:57,369
There could be some nutrients in there.

1958
01:51:57,369 --> 01:52:01,750
Oil is just the earth's blood.

1959
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:11,239
What do you mean false?

1960
01:52:11,239 --> 01:52:17,260
It's the opposite of that.

1961
01:52:17,819 --> 01:52:19,739
It's like decomposed like soil

1962
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:22,220
and then boogers and stuff

1963
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:27,420
and old shit and piss and diarrhea and bones and jello.

1964
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:28,939
All the old jello that they threw away.

1965
01:52:28,939 --> 01:52:31,500
It all turns into oil in the ground after like 600 million years.

1966
01:52:45,319 --> 01:52:45,880
Okay.

1967
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:47,140
I have to pull the plug on this.

1968
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,699
I got to restart.

1969
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:50,630
I can't believe I did it for this long.

1970
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,310
I'm so ashamed that I did it for this long

1971
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,510
and I didn't see it to the end.

1972
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:59,050
I'm ashamed.

1973
01:53:04,579 --> 01:53:05,539
You're almost there.

1974
01:53:05,539 --> 01:53:06,979
Get to that rock formation.

1975
01:53:06,979 --> 01:53:07,539
I can't...

1976
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:10,539
I feel like that rock formation is permanently in the background.

1977
01:53:10,539 --> 01:53:11,899
I did tell you when I hit this bend

1978
01:53:11,899 --> 01:53:13,420
if it wasn't right here that I was done

1979
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:14,699
and I was going to restart.

1980
01:53:14,699 --> 01:53:17,510
Come on.

1981
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,909
Right here.

1982
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:19,319
What's that?

1983
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,319
We found...

1984
01:53:21,319 --> 01:53:21,720
Okay.

1985
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,760
We've got something.

1986
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:23,319
We got something.

1987
01:53:23,319 --> 01:53:23,720
We got something.

1988
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,119
We got something.

1989
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:24,600
We have something.

1990
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,079
Something here.

1991
01:53:25,079 --> 01:53:25,479
What's that?

1992
01:53:29,130 --> 01:53:29,689
What is that?

1993
01:53:31,529 --> 01:53:32,970
I see something in the distance.

1994
01:53:32,970 --> 01:53:33,850
I see a tower.

1995
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:34,649
I see like a...

1996
01:53:34,649 --> 01:53:35,770
Is that an oil tower?

1997
01:53:37,369 --> 01:53:39,529
There's definitely like a car over there.

1998
01:53:39,529 --> 01:53:40,569
We're good boys and girls.

1999
01:53:44,659 --> 01:53:48,020
Stare at this until you can't see anymore.

2000
01:53:48,020 --> 01:53:48,579
We're almost there.

2001
01:53:50,819 --> 01:53:51,779
We're so close.

2002
01:53:51,779 --> 01:53:52,180
Okay.

2003
01:53:52,180 --> 01:53:53,060
I'm happy now.

2004
01:53:58,039 --> 01:53:59,399
But how far away is that actually?

2005
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:00,439
Get my gun.

2006
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:05,590
Spawned in.

2007
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,779
Holy shit.

2008
01:54:20,779 --> 01:54:21,659
Why do you have so many hits?

2009
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:30,920
I might need this.

2010
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:31,960
I'm going to take this from me.

2011
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:41,819
Where'd it go?

2012
01:54:41,819 --> 01:54:43,319
Where'd it go?

2013
01:54:43,319 --> 01:54:50,229
There it is.

2014
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:50,390
All right.

2015
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:51,350
I'm going to hold it up to the sun.

2016
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:53,350
I'm going to cook it with the sun's rays.

2017
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:55,029
If I hold it here long enough,

2018
01:54:55,029 --> 01:54:57,930
it'll get like at least like internal temperature

2019
01:54:57,930 --> 01:54:59,210
of like 140 degrees, right?

2020
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,130
You and me, buddy.

2021
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:14,409
You and me are best friends now.

2022
01:55:14,409 --> 01:55:14,890
Come with me.

2023
01:55:15,529 --> 01:55:17,829
This is my Wilson now.

2024
01:55:17,829 --> 01:55:18,470
Wilson.

2025
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,069
Do you see what's out there, Wilson?

2026
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:21,979
It's a bus.

2027
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:26,439
Can you believe it?

2028
01:55:26,439 --> 01:55:28,119
I can't even believe it, Wilson.

2029
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,460
And you all wanted to restart Randy.

2030
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:38,619
You're not going to get it from here.

2031
01:55:38,619 --> 01:55:39,819
He's just my shade.

2032
01:55:39,819 --> 01:55:41,020
He's my sunglasses.

2033
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:43,770
There's a big bus over here.

2034
01:55:47,189 --> 01:55:48,949
You can do a better Tom Hanks.

2035
01:55:48,949 --> 01:55:51,100
Maybe.

2036
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,420
I'm so happy that there's this huge bus over here.

2037
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:56,170
Yes.

2038
01:55:56,170 --> 01:55:59,109
This thing is huge.

2039
01:55:59,829 --> 01:56:00,970
Okay.

2040
01:56:01,529 --> 01:56:03,020
So now what?

2041
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:04,390
Does it need anything?

2042
01:56:04,390 --> 01:56:05,350
Do we have gas?

2043
01:56:05,350 --> 01:56:08,899
How tall am I?

2044
01:56:08,899 --> 01:56:11,510
Okay.

2045
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:12,710
First of all, let me look up here.

2046
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:15,109
There's a ladder here.

2047
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:24,439
Can you get up there, please?

2048
01:56:24,439 --> 01:56:28,069
What's in there?

2049
01:56:28,069 --> 01:56:30,260
Bring this up.

2050
01:56:30,260 --> 01:56:34,500
Why can I not touch this?

2051
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:43,510
Get it.

2052
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:44,470
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

2053
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:45,029
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

2054
01:56:45,029 --> 01:56:45,670
Get it, get it, get it.

2055
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:47,159
I couldn't pick it up.

2056
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:47,560
Draining.

2057
01:56:47,560 --> 01:56:47,960
It's draining.

2058
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:48,359
It's draining.

2059
01:56:48,359 --> 01:56:49,159
It's draining right now.

2060
01:56:49,159 --> 01:57:03,239
How do I go down?

2061
01:57:03,239 --> 01:57:03,720
Stop.

2062
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:11,939
Stop.

2063
01:57:11,939 --> 01:57:12,500
Oh, fuck.

2064
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,359
There's a hole in it.

2065
01:57:14,359 --> 01:57:17,560
What is this, though?

2066
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,119
Snow.

2067
01:57:18,119 --> 01:57:18,359
Stop.

2068
01:57:18,359 --> 01:57:19,560
Pick up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

2069
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:20,439
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2070
01:57:20,439 --> 01:57:21,319
What is in this?

2071
01:57:21,319 --> 01:57:29,079
Can empty whatever.

2072
01:57:29,079 --> 01:57:30,500
How do I get in?

2073
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,380
Get me in.

2074
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,989
How do I get in the car?

2075
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:39,770
How do I get in the bus?

2076
01:57:48,329 --> 01:57:50,810
Push, push, push, push, push, push.

2077
01:57:51,529 --> 01:58:07,720
I don't understand.

2078
01:58:16,539 --> 01:58:17,819
Can I not get in this?

2079
01:58:17,819 --> 01:58:21,050
I won't even tell me that I walked all this way

2080
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:24,149
and I can't get in this fucking bus.

2081
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:25,750
Under the front bumper.

2082
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:33,140
Smash the window.

2083
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:43,399
Blind.

2084
01:58:43,399 --> 01:58:44,600
What do you mean blind?

2085
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:48,500
Right there, right there.

2086
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:50,060
What are you talking about?

2087
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:50,699
Where?

2088
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,989
You see a button on the bumper?

2089
01:58:57,619 --> 01:58:58,579
There's no button.

2090
01:59:00,500 --> 01:59:02,340
Where is there a button on the bumper?

2091
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:03,380
What are you talking about?

2092
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:04,340
Under the bumper?

2093
01:59:05,779 --> 01:59:07,140
What kind of car?

2094
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:08,579
Why does...

2095
01:59:08,579 --> 01:59:11,079
What kind of dumb car is that?

2096
01:59:11,079 --> 01:59:12,600
Why do you have a hidden open the door

2097
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:13,479
under the bumper button?

2098
01:59:13,479 --> 01:59:14,119
Why can't it...

2099
01:59:14,119 --> 01:59:14,520
What do you...

2100
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,819
What?

2101
01:59:16,819 --> 01:59:18,180
All right, I'm ready.

2102
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:21,420
Is there anything in here?

2103
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:27,739
Okay, thank God.

2104
01:59:27,739 --> 01:59:28,380
Let's go.

2105
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:29,420
Let's get the hell out of here.

2106
01:59:33,829 --> 01:59:35,189
Oh, thank goodness.

2107
01:59:35,189 --> 01:59:36,779
All right, how do I close the door?

2108
01:59:36,779 --> 01:59:44,659
Come on, man.

2109
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:45,859
Come on.

2110
01:59:46,869 --> 01:59:47,430
Come on.

2111
01:59:50,739 --> 01:59:51,619
Come on.

2112
01:59:58,279 --> 01:59:58,680
Oil.

2113
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:03,859
Oh, I have oil.

2114
02:00:03,859 --> 02:00:04,579
Okay, where does it go?

2115
02:00:06,409 --> 02:00:07,289
Why is the bus moving?

2116
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:10,140
Why are we moving?

2117
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:17,699
Is oil in here?

2118
02:00:17,699 --> 02:00:18,180
I don't know.

2119
02:00:18,180 --> 02:00:20,100
How do I open up the bus?

2120
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:21,380
How do I open up the tank?

2121
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:23,859
I've never driven a bus before, guys.

2122
02:00:23,859 --> 02:00:24,260
I don't know.

2123
02:00:24,260 --> 02:00:25,939
Where's the secret James Bond button

2124
02:00:25,939 --> 02:00:27,699
to open the fucking front hood?

2125
02:00:27,699 --> 02:00:33,399
It's in the back?

2126
02:00:33,399 --> 02:00:38,439
Okay, let's put this down.

2127
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:45,140
Is there another weird button?

2128
02:00:45,140 --> 02:00:46,579
Side panels on the back?

2129
02:00:52,329 --> 02:00:53,689
I don't know how to open this.

2130
02:00:57,989 --> 02:00:58,869
Side panel?

2131
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:04,569
There ain't nothing in there.

2132
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:10,810
Shit, the fuel tank is empty.

2133
02:01:11,449 --> 02:01:12,329
It's empty.

2134
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:32,470
Oh, fuck you.

2135
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:34,010
You guys are not even...

2136
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:34,890
He's fast.

2137
02:01:34,890 --> 02:01:35,529
He's fast.

2138
02:01:35,529 --> 02:01:36,170
He's fast.

2139
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:36,970
He's fast.

2140
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:47,460
Fuck, are you doing?

2141
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,100
Fire.

2142
02:01:48,100 --> 02:02:01,130
I seriously...

2143
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:02,170
I can't believe it.

2144
02:02:02,170 --> 02:02:05,539
Was it gas in that little tank that I shot

2145
02:02:05,539 --> 02:02:06,979
because I couldn't pick the fucking thing up?

2146
02:02:07,539 --> 02:02:10,340
All right, 3% oil.

2147
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:12,579
It's 100% oil right now, but that's okay.

2148
02:02:13,930 --> 02:02:15,210
I'm so sad right now.

2149
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:16,090
I can't believe it.

2150
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:17,050
There's nothing in there.

2151
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:18,170
Nothing at all.

2152
02:02:18,170 --> 02:02:19,289
Absolutely nothing.

2153
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:22,170
I can't just like drip the drops in there.

2154
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:46,279
Will that work?

2155
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:48,680
Can you imagine if this is fucking turned on?

2156
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,989
Why?

2157
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:17,609
That's so sad.

2158
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:24,439
Now I actually have to restart.

2159
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:25,479
Check the panels?

2160
02:03:25,479 --> 02:03:26,920
Check the side panels.

2161
02:03:26,920 --> 02:03:33,670
Wait, there might be gas in these?

2162
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:46,500
No.

2163
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:47,699
Wilson!

2164
02:03:48,579 --> 02:03:49,380
Wilson, I'm sorry.

2165
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,300
I'm running over your head right now.

2166
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:51,939
It'll be okay.

2167
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,979
Okay, I have to restart.

2168
02:04:06,979 --> 02:04:08,020
I have to restart.

2169
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:09,140
I'm so sad to do this.

2170
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:27,270
Check under the tower.

2171
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:33,130
If there's nothing under here, I'm done.

2172
02:04:33,130 --> 02:04:34,010
That's so sad.

2173
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:34,409
Oh well.

2174
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:46,140
No, nothing.

2175
02:04:46,140 --> 02:05:16,819
Damn it.

2176
02:05:16,819 --> 02:05:23,079
I had to try.

2177
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:25,060
Okay, I'm ready.

2178
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:26,020
This is the real one.

2179
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,600
What's the point of having that?

2180
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:31,239
This is the real one.

2181
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:33,239
Hey, Shimpa, thanks for the 20...

2182
02:05:34,359 --> 02:05:38,260
Okay, Shimpa gave 40 community subs.

2183
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:41,930
Thank you for the insane amount of money, Shimpa.

2184
02:05:41,930 --> 02:05:45,779
Thanks for the 40 subs.

2185
02:05:45,779 --> 02:05:48,409
Of course, this car sucks.

2186
02:05:48,409 --> 02:05:51,350
Anything else back here?

2187
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:53,750
Also, I think I got base burning already,

2188
02:05:53,750 --> 02:05:55,510
but thank you base burning for the five.

2189
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:57,350
Thanks for the fucking 40 subs.

2190
02:05:57,350 --> 02:05:58,149
Can I call anybody?

2191
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:01,260
You guys are giving stupid amounts of money today.

2192
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:01,579
Thank you.

2193
02:06:03,579 --> 02:06:04,539
This is the only car that I got.

2194
02:06:06,970 --> 02:06:07,930
This is it.

2195
02:06:07,930 --> 02:06:11,180
Nothing else in all the secrets back here.

2196
02:06:21,579 --> 02:06:23,899
6,000 of you just thought that was the funniest thing

2197
02:06:23,899 --> 02:06:25,420
that's happened the whole stream.

2198
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:27,420
And I'll take it because, you know, comedy is comedy,

2199
02:06:27,420 --> 02:06:28,619
even if it's not very good.

2200
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:31,609
All right, what we got?

2201
02:06:32,170 --> 02:06:37,189
All right, this is water and gas.

2202
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:40,250
This time, I'm not going to fuck around.

2203
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:42,060
This is the real playthrough.

2204
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,939
This is the real one here.

2205
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,619
Fair tire in the back, good.

2206
02:06:46,619 --> 02:06:48,340
Get this in there.

2207
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,420
Take the water too.

2208
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:50,979
We might need it.

2209
02:06:59,319 --> 02:07:01,020
But we're good.

2210
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:01,819
We're ready.

2211
02:07:01,819 --> 02:07:03,079
Fuel tank, is that 100%?

2212
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:09,529
Oh, upstairs.

2213
02:07:09,529 --> 02:07:18,699
Okay, there's a rabbit.

2214
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:19,420
Go upstairs.

2215
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:20,539
How do I get up there?

2216
02:07:20,539 --> 02:07:29,859
Oh shit, there's a bucket here.

2217
02:07:35,159 --> 02:07:36,279
Who's trying to get in the window?

2218
02:07:45,029 --> 02:07:47,300
Windex, what is this?

2219
02:07:49,659 --> 02:07:51,260
Oh, it's a face mist.

2220
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:54,520
What even is this?

2221
02:07:59,539 --> 02:08:13,529
What about in here?

2222
02:08:13,529 --> 02:08:14,649
Cool little like hobbit hole.

2223
02:08:14,649 --> 02:08:15,930
All right, let's drive.

2224
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:21,380
Yeah, I just realized what I was just doing right there.

2225
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:21,859
You're right.

2226
02:08:23,989 --> 02:08:25,670
Yeah, that was kind of weird,

2227
02:08:25,670 --> 02:08:27,590
but it was not what I was trying to do.

2228
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:33,800
Let's go.

2229
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,000
Time to really drive for real.

2230
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:47,590
Get the diesel this time.

2231
02:08:47,590 --> 02:08:49,739
No, no, no diesel.

2232
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:57,239
Can't even adjust this mirror.

2233
02:08:57,239 --> 02:08:57,720
There we go.

2234
02:08:58,359 --> 02:09:08,039
Stop.

2235
02:09:08,039 --> 02:09:09,159
I'm not going to do that.

2236
02:09:09,159 --> 02:09:10,520
I will not do that again.

2237
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:12,520
I 100 million percent promise.

2238
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:26,090
Thank God I dodged that accidentally.

2239
02:09:26,729 --> 02:09:38,779
Okay, this one, I'm going to get far on this one.

2240
02:09:43,159 --> 02:09:44,359
I can't help it, I have to.

2241
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:48,390
How much gas do I have?

2242
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:48,949
Not a whole lot.

2243
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:53,529
Look at the fuel indicator.

2244
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,020
Is that full?

2245
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:57,859
Wait, that's left to right.

2246
02:09:58,180 --> 02:09:59,300
Right is empty.

2247
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:00,340
In what kind of world is that?

2248
02:10:02,739 --> 02:10:03,859
Don't be a fucking idiot.

2249
02:10:03,859 --> 02:10:04,340
Slow down.

2250
02:10:04,979 --> 02:10:14,039
That's the fuel right there, right?

2251
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:15,239
Oh, no, that's the fuel.

2252
02:10:15,239 --> 02:10:18,970
Okay, what the hell is that then?

2253
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:21,979
B-O triangle, triangle?

2254
02:10:22,699 --> 02:10:36,380
Temperature, yeah.

2255
02:10:44,619 --> 02:10:45,579
Why is this camera in here?

2256
02:10:45,579 --> 02:10:46,699
Oh, it's because it's in the car.

2257
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:50,100
Well, that's doesn't do.

2258
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,699
That's not a good place to put it.

2259
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:55,859
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2260
02:10:55,859 --> 02:10:56,579
This is going to be cool.

2261
02:10:56,579 --> 02:10:57,079
Ready?

2262
02:10:57,539 --> 02:11:09,479
Here we go.

2263
02:11:09,479 --> 02:11:09,979
Let's go.

2264
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:13,260
See you later.

2265
02:11:22,539 --> 02:11:23,039
Cool.

2266
02:11:30,359 --> 02:11:31,239
Come back.

2267
02:11:31,239 --> 02:11:32,600
I just dropped you guys off.

2268
02:11:33,239 --> 02:11:34,619
Good luck.

2269
02:11:36,569 --> 02:11:39,130
I just every 90s comedy movie'd you guys.

2270
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:46,569
Oh, I got to walk in the fucking desert

2271
02:11:46,569 --> 02:11:48,729
for potentially two or three minutes.

2272
02:11:49,689 --> 02:11:51,130
And then somebody's going to pull up.

2273
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:54,409
It's going to be a bus full of like cheerleaders.

2274
02:11:56,119 --> 02:11:56,619
No way.

2275
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:03,100
Tower.

2276
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:11,789
Where's that tower?

2277
02:12:11,789 --> 02:12:13,369
Let's get that off.

2278
02:12:13,369 --> 02:12:14,250
All right, where's the tower?

2279
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:20,250
Let's go.

2280
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:36,510
Let's go.

2281
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:37,069
All right.

2282
02:12:37,069 --> 02:12:38,109
Do you want me to give you my best?

2283
02:12:38,109 --> 02:12:38,609
Let's go.

2284
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:40,670
No, it probably hurt.

2285
02:12:43,119 --> 02:12:44,000
Nothing here.

2286
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,319
But there might be a treat at the top of the tower.

2287
02:12:49,949 --> 02:12:54,460
No, no bus friends for us to be happy about.

2288
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:55,819
All right, but there's something up there though.

2289
02:12:57,149 --> 02:12:59,710
Hopefully it's oil or fuel or gas or something.

2290
02:12:59,710 --> 02:13:00,430
Let's go.

2291
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:01,149
Ow, my eyes.

2292
02:13:01,789 --> 02:13:06,989
All right, do you want me to like to like 14 year old Xbox live?

2293
02:13:06,989 --> 02:13:07,470
Let's go.

2294
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:09,229
Or like 35 year old adult screaming?

2295
02:13:09,229 --> 02:13:09,949
Let's go.

2296
02:13:09,949 --> 02:13:18,180
14, okay.

2297
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:20,859
Yo, let's go.

2298
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:23,000
No, let's go.

2299
02:13:24,119 --> 02:13:26,520
You don't want to wake up anybody in your house,

2300
02:13:26,520 --> 02:13:28,039
especially like your parents or something.

2301
02:13:28,039 --> 02:13:43,119
If I drop this, is it going to break?

2302
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:43,600
Easy.

2303
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:50,590
All right, what's in here?

2304
02:13:50,590 --> 02:13:51,090
Gas.

2305
02:13:51,710 --> 02:13:54,189
It's 1.3 liters of gas.

2306
02:13:55,069 --> 02:13:57,479
Hey, go into the gas storage.

2307
02:13:57,479 --> 02:14:03,579
No, don't do that.

2308
02:14:03,579 --> 02:14:04,140
I want in here.

2309
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,420
I got plenty of gas.

2310
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:11,210
I'm going to be the guy that sells it to everybody.

2311
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:14,409
And then be the guy who gets robbed and killed first

2312
02:14:14,409 --> 02:14:17,310
because you have all the stuff that everyone wants.

2313
02:14:17,310 --> 02:14:19,869
You can't just pull up like this in an apocalyptic scenario.

2314
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:23,149
Okay, so that'll be $10 a gallon, please.

2315
02:14:23,149 --> 02:14:24,670
Nope, I'll take it all.

2316
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:28,510
Oh, but my plan.

2317
02:14:29,149 --> 02:14:34,439
Chimpa just gave another 20 subs.

2318
02:14:35,079 --> 02:14:36,359
Chimpa, that's 60 on the day.

2319
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,810
Holy shit, dude.

2320
02:14:39,529 --> 02:14:45,159
That's a fucking ton of money.

2321
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:46,939
All right, which way is the right way?

2322
02:14:46,939 --> 02:14:47,899
I don't remember.

2323
02:14:47,899 --> 02:14:52,569
I think it's this left, right?

2324
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:59,399
Yeah, it's like if you're the guy with like 500 cans of Campbell's soup,

2325
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,720
500 people are going to show up to your house.

2326
02:15:03,359 --> 02:15:05,279
Uh, give me one of those.

2327
02:15:07,689 --> 02:15:08,970
No, okay.

2328
02:15:09,050 --> 02:15:10,810
I'll be back with 100 people to take them.

2329
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:27,880
Oh, I had a minute.

2330
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:29,000
I know I could do it in time.

2331
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,239
No one likes Campbell's soup.

2332
02:15:34,239 --> 02:15:35,920
You don't have to like Campbell's soup.

2333
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,050
You're going to eat it in an apocalyptic scenario.

2334
02:15:41,449 --> 02:15:42,649
I'm sorry, but if you don't...

2335
02:15:42,649 --> 02:15:44,569
Oh, I don't enjoy Campbell's.

2336
02:15:44,569 --> 02:15:46,569
I guess I'll die of starvation.

2337
02:15:47,369 --> 02:15:48,460
What was in the road?

2338
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:49,100
What was in the road?

2339
02:15:49,739 --> 02:15:50,460
What was in the road?

2340
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:51,979
What was in the road?

2341
02:15:52,859 --> 02:15:54,619
What was possibly in the road?

2342
02:15:54,619 --> 02:15:56,220
Oh, like a fucking trash bag.

2343
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,659
Like a sleeping bag was in the road.

2344
02:15:57,659 --> 02:15:58,140
Okay, cool.

2345
02:15:58,939 --> 02:16:01,600
I lost a mirror.

2346
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:07,149
I'm good.

2347
02:16:07,710 --> 02:16:09,770
Can I put this back on?

2348
02:16:21,479 --> 02:16:30,119
There we go.

2349
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:31,000
We're fine.

2350
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,200
Everything's fine.

2351
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:32,760
Everything's fine.

2352
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:39,870
Everything's fine.

2353
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:40,670
Uh, what happened to the...

2354
02:16:41,309 --> 02:16:46,120
Why can I see through into my car's skeleton right now?

2355
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:59,260
Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

2356
02:16:59,260 --> 02:16:59,899
I can do it all.

2357
02:16:59,899 --> 02:17:00,540
I can do it all day.

2358
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:10,559
Right, right, right.

2359
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,879
What?

2360
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:14,440
What's right?

2361
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:18,879
There's a boat?

2362
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:28,139
Is that a boat?

2363
02:17:28,139 --> 02:17:28,940
Is that what you're talking about?

2364
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:31,450
What do you mean boat?

2365
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:32,489
Left.

2366
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:38,590
Oh my God.

2367
02:17:38,590 --> 02:17:39,149
Holy shit.

2368
02:17:39,149 --> 02:17:41,149
It's actually just like made out of like paper.

2369
02:17:41,149 --> 02:17:41,870
It's a plant.

2370
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:42,270
I'm okay.

2371
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:43,069
I'm fine.

2372
02:17:43,069 --> 02:17:45,629
I felt like I was going to go through the windshield from hitting a cactus.

2373
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:49,819
I don't know why I thought that was like a cinder block.

2374
02:17:58,540 --> 02:17:59,899
Why is there a boat over here?

2375
02:17:59,899 --> 02:18:00,459
That's weird.

2376
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:04,059
It's a battleship.

2377
02:18:04,059 --> 02:18:05,020
Yeah, that makes no sense.

2378
02:18:05,579 --> 02:18:06,639
Let's investigate.

2379
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:17,450
I didn't do it.

2380
02:18:17,450 --> 02:18:22,750
Can I actually...

2381
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:23,870
Dude, are there uh...

2382
02:18:25,239 --> 02:18:26,440
Is there like secrets in here?

2383
02:18:32,510 --> 02:18:33,549
Let's just live here.

2384
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:34,989
We could, I guess.

2385
02:18:35,709 --> 02:18:42,729
There's a little place you can go in.

2386
02:18:42,729 --> 02:18:44,329
All right, I gotta get my gun.

2387
02:18:44,329 --> 02:18:47,420
This is probably a monster.

2388
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:47,979
Holy shit.

2389
02:18:47,979 --> 02:18:49,420
Look at all that fuel in here.

2390
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:50,059
I need to...

2391
02:18:50,059 --> 02:18:50,860
Do I have room for that?

2392
02:18:51,579 --> 02:19:06,010
I'm going in.

2393
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:14,250
Pick up.

2394
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:14,969
What is it though?

2395
02:19:14,969 --> 02:19:18,059
What's in here?

2396
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:26,040
I can drink it, but what is it though?

2397
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:26,680
Empty.

2398
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:30,030
This is oil.

2399
02:19:30,030 --> 02:19:32,780
Shit.

2400
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,059
I might need to take some of these.

2401
02:19:34,059 --> 02:19:36,059
Can I like siphon some of this?

2402
02:19:36,059 --> 02:19:38,299
Can I just dump it in the back of this seat and shit?

2403
02:19:38,299 --> 02:19:39,260
Can I take any of this?

2404
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:42,319
That's a lot of oil.

2405
02:19:42,319 --> 02:19:43,040
Okay, hold on.

2406
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,200
What's in this one?

2407
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:45,600
Gas.

2408
02:19:46,319 --> 02:19:48,479
This is 57 liters of gas.

2409
02:19:48,479 --> 02:19:49,200
I have to take this.

2410
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:57,180
I need to take all of these somehow.

2411
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:57,899
Let's fill this...

2412
02:19:57,899 --> 02:19:59,420
Okay, we're gonna fill this car up completely.

2413
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:05,370
We're gonna fill the whole tank.

2414
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:06,090
All right, let's take it in.

2415
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:07,770
Okay, this is gas, right?

2416
02:20:07,770 --> 02:20:13,020
All right, let's go.

2417
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:15,790
Fill up all your other containers.

2418
02:20:15,790 --> 02:20:16,430
Holy shit.

2419
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:17,790
I think we just hit the jackpot.

2420
02:20:40,729 --> 02:20:41,690
Can you get in?

2421
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:43,719
Get in the car and drive.

2422
02:20:43,719 --> 02:20:44,520
Just run in front of him.

2423
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:45,399
Run, run, run, run, run.

2424
02:20:53,229 --> 02:21:11,739
I'm going to bed.

2425
02:21:11,739 --> 02:21:12,620
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2426
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:14,299
I left the lights on all night.

2427
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:15,020
Is that bad?

2428
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:17,469
I left the lights on the whole night.

2429
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:23,920
That's not gonna be bad, right?

2430
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:25,520
All right, pray that it's not a problem.

2431
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,079
Thank God.

2432
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:29,200
Okay, it turns off.

2433
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:39,440
This is heavy.

2434
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:40,719
How am I even picking this up by myself?

2435
02:21:40,719 --> 02:21:41,680
Can I just dump it in there?

2436
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:45,260
We're gonna have so much gas and so much oil.

2437
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:46,219
I'm gonna be rich.

2438
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:56,159
All right, here we go.

2439
02:21:56,159 --> 02:21:58,860
Want this in here?

2440
02:21:59,799 --> 02:22:01,000
We were out of gas.

2441
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:10,190
I didn't even know that.

2442
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:11,149
Fill this whole thing.

2443
02:22:11,709 --> 02:22:19,819
As long as I don't run anything over,

2444
02:22:19,819 --> 02:22:21,739
this car could probably take me pretty far.

2445
02:22:21,739 --> 02:22:28,799
Sure, this is original shit car,

2446
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:32,239
but I could take the doors off other cars and repaint it.

2447
02:22:33,479 --> 02:22:34,440
Don't forget the oil.

2448
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:35,559
How much oil do I need?

2449
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:38,000
3% oil, right?

2450
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:41,079
3%...

2451
02:22:41,079 --> 02:22:43,000
Okay, 1% of 40 is 4.

2452
02:22:43,639 --> 02:22:44,760
4, 8, 12...

2453
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:45,479
Hold on.

2454
02:22:45,479 --> 02:22:46,200
No, wait.

2455
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:48,399
1% of 40...

2456
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:50,000
Okay, now what?

2457
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:59,239
That oil over here is the one, right?

2458
02:22:59,239 --> 02:23:04,860
Yep.

2459
02:23:04,860 --> 02:23:06,620
No, no, no, stop.

2460
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:07,879
This is not a 2.

2461
02:23:09,440 --> 02:23:11,040
I don't know what that even is supposed to mean.

2462
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,719
What do you mean this is not a 2?

2463
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:14,239
Guys, I just go to the gas station,

2464
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:16,239
put the thing in and just hold it down.

2465
02:23:16,239 --> 02:23:17,200
I don't even know what's in there.

2466
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:23,479
It's just this makes your car move.

2467
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:25,719
I don't know anything else about it.

2468
02:23:25,719 --> 02:23:31,360
So just gas.

2469
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:34,319
It's not a two-stroke engine.

2470
02:23:34,319 --> 02:23:35,840
Do not put oil in the fuel tank.

2471
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:49,950
Okay, saved.

2472
02:23:51,549 --> 02:23:55,200
This is a lot of gas too.

2473
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:55,840
This is great.

2474
02:23:56,479 --> 02:23:59,579
And there's still more in here.

2475
02:24:01,479 --> 02:24:04,190
Oh, have you seen a full tank before?

2476
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:05,440
Close that up.

2477
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:08,520
Okay, what about in here?

2478
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:10,829
So this is...

2479
02:24:11,469 --> 02:24:13,129
What's in there?

2480
02:24:13,129 --> 02:24:14,010
Is this water?

2481
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:20,719
This is water.

2482
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:22,000
All right, fuck this, just drink it.

2483
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:39,069
How much is left in here?

2484
02:24:39,069 --> 02:24:39,709
3.3.

2485
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:41,149
Stop, stop, stop.

2486
02:24:41,149 --> 02:24:42,190
You need water.

2487
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:59,559
Oh, get out of here.

2488
02:24:59,559 --> 02:25:06,319
Okay, put this away.

2489
02:25:06,319 --> 02:25:07,120
Fill this up at least.

2490
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:07,440
This is...

2491
02:25:08,729 --> 02:25:09,209
All right, here we go.

2492
02:25:09,209 --> 02:25:09,690
This is gas.

2493
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:10,489
Let's fill the gas up.

2494
02:25:12,010 --> 02:25:13,129
Open the hood for the oil.

2495
02:25:13,129 --> 02:25:14,090
Yeah, I will.

2496
02:25:14,090 --> 02:25:16,489
Let's fill this up.

2497
02:25:16,489 --> 02:25:17,129
Is this...

2498
02:25:17,129 --> 02:25:18,569
How much is left in here?

2499
02:25:18,569 --> 02:25:20,329
Oh, plenty.

2500
02:25:20,329 --> 02:25:20,809
Okay, let's go.

2501
02:25:20,809 --> 02:25:21,129
Ready?

2502
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:41,959
Mix water and gas to make a potion.

2503
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:43,870
Stop.

2504
02:25:43,870 --> 02:25:44,590
What do you mean stop?

2505
02:25:45,149 --> 02:25:47,180
I'm filling this gas tank up.

2506
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:47,899
What do you mean waste?

2507
02:25:47,899 --> 02:25:48,540
What are you talking about?

2508
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:49,020
I got it.

2509
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:49,819
I'm good.

2510
02:25:49,819 --> 02:25:50,829
I'm not missed.

2511
02:25:50,829 --> 02:25:51,629
What are you talking about?

2512
02:25:52,190 --> 02:25:57,629
All right.

2513
02:25:57,629 --> 02:25:58,430
Now it's spilt.

2514
02:25:58,430 --> 02:25:59,389
Now you spilled it.

2515
02:25:59,389 --> 02:26:00,110
Now you spilled it.

2516
02:26:00,110 --> 02:26:00,829
Thanks a lot, chat.

2517
02:26:00,829 --> 02:26:01,549
Now you spilled it.

2518
02:26:09,209 --> 02:26:10,090
God, I had it.

2519
02:26:11,129 --> 02:26:20,120
And then we're gonna put the oil in the front

2520
02:26:20,120 --> 02:26:21,399
and then we're gonna load up

2521
02:26:21,399 --> 02:26:22,280
and get the hell out of here.

2522
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:26,510
I'm sorry.

2523
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:26,909
I'm sorry.

2524
02:26:26,909 --> 02:26:27,870
I'm sorry.

2525
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:31,280
You're not drinking water.

2526
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:35,450
You're drinking coolant.

2527
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:35,690
All right.

2528
02:26:35,690 --> 02:26:36,170
That's good.

2529
02:26:36,889 --> 02:26:38,729
That's filled up.

2530
02:26:38,729 --> 02:26:42,520
And you tell me don't...

2531
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:44,520
I need the water for something eventually.

2532
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:45,159
All right.

2533
02:26:45,159 --> 02:26:46,700
Well, this is gonna be fun.

2534
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:47,739
Let's just do this.

2535
02:26:47,739 --> 02:26:58,170
I almost just died.

2536
02:26:58,170 --> 02:27:21,420
I was trying to do skeet shooting.

2537
02:27:21,420 --> 02:27:22,620
It doesn't even do anything.

2538
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:24,780
Okay.

2539
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:25,420
Oil.

2540
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:32,799
Fill it up.

2541
02:27:43,469 --> 02:27:44,350
I don't know, dude.

2542
02:27:45,629 --> 02:27:52,590
Okay.

2543
02:27:52,590 --> 02:27:55,440
That's 100% coolant.

2544
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:56,559
Oh, shit.

2545
02:27:56,559 --> 02:28:13,579
Okay.

2546
02:28:13,579 --> 02:28:17,479
We got 100% full.

2547
02:28:17,479 --> 02:28:22,270
Get out of the way.

2548
02:28:22,270 --> 02:28:22,989
I can't see this.

2549
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:27,979
You dare.

2550
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:29,879
Don't, please.

2551
02:28:29,879 --> 02:28:30,120
Okay.

2552
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:30,680
Everything's full.

2553
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:33,959
Close it.

2554
02:28:33,959 --> 02:28:34,680
I'm taking this.

2555
02:28:37,389 --> 02:28:37,709
Fuck.

2556
02:28:38,879 --> 02:28:40,239
No, there's still plenty of water in there.

2557
02:28:40,239 --> 02:28:41,040
Let's get a couple of sips.

2558
02:28:46,879 --> 02:28:47,600
All right.

2559
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:48,000
Okay.

2560
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:49,040
All right.

2561
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:50,159
We're good.

2562
02:28:50,959 --> 02:28:51,920
It's time to continue.

2563
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:52,719
But wait.

2564
02:28:52,719 --> 02:28:54,159
I'm gonna bring a barrel of this with me.

2565
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:57,069
Find a water barrel.

2566
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:03,340
Alcohol.

2567
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:16,010
What do I need that for?

2568
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:23,719
Do I need alcohol for something?

2569
02:29:23,719 --> 02:29:25,079
Water.

2570
02:29:25,079 --> 02:29:27,770
Alcohol.

2571
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:28,250
Empty.

2572
02:29:28,250 --> 02:29:28,969
I'm looking for water.

2573
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:32,000
I just want to fill my water tank.

2574
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:32,399
Gas.

2575
02:29:33,450 --> 02:29:34,879
Water.

2576
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:35,280
Oil.

2577
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:37,319
Gas.

2578
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:40,510
I probably can take one.

2579
02:29:40,510 --> 02:29:41,709
I could take one of these with me.

2580
02:29:41,709 --> 02:29:44,030
I'm gonna take one of the gasoline with me, at least.

2581
02:29:44,030 --> 02:29:49,159
Come on.

2582
02:29:54,120 --> 02:29:55,159
Take a keg with you.

2583
02:29:55,799 --> 02:29:56,120
No.

2584
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:57,319
I'm not taking one of these kegs.

2585
02:29:57,319 --> 02:29:59,239
I'm gonna take one of those with gas.

2586
02:29:59,799 --> 02:30:08,909
That's gas and oil.

2587
02:30:08,909 --> 02:30:09,069
Okay.

2588
02:30:09,069 --> 02:30:10,270
That's a weird combo thing.

2589
02:30:10,989 --> 02:30:16,700
I'm not sure any of these can even be water.

2590
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:19,719
I think it's just either gas, oil, or alcohol.

2591
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:26,479
What the hell is this?

2592
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:29,120
What is that?

2593
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:30,430
Oh, it's a cactus.

2594
02:30:31,549 --> 02:30:31,870
Yeah.

2595
02:30:31,870 --> 02:30:32,829
Gas and oil.

2596
02:30:32,829 --> 02:30:33,149
All right.

2597
02:30:33,149 --> 02:30:34,190
I'm just taking one of the gases.

2598
02:30:34,750 --> 02:30:36,729
I'm just taking one of the big gas ones.

2599
02:30:36,729 --> 02:30:39,600
Which one?

2600
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:40,639
There's one line here somewhere.

2601
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:41,680
It was just all gas.

2602
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:42,639
This one here?

2603
02:30:42,639 --> 02:30:45,420
This one here?

2604
02:30:45,420 --> 02:30:46,139
No.

2605
02:30:46,139 --> 02:30:48,799
Take the alcohol.

2606
02:30:53,149 --> 02:30:54,750
Do I need the alcohol?

2607
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:55,149
Do I?

2608
02:30:55,709 --> 02:30:57,209
All right.

2609
02:30:57,209 --> 02:30:58,170
Well, this says 35.

2610
02:30:58,809 --> 02:31:00,750
This is the most so far.

2611
02:31:05,229 --> 02:31:06,030
I'm taking the gas.

2612
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:09,120
I'm taking the gas.

2613
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:10,319
It's more important to me.

2614
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,639
Alcohol.

2615
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:13,280
Take the alcohol.

2616
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,680
Fix the alcohol and the gas.

2617
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:35,200
I can probably fit them both.

2618
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:38,879
I can probably fit them both.

2619
02:31:42,239 --> 02:31:43,440
I just drank it.

2620
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:51,899
Shit.

2621
02:31:51,899 --> 02:31:54,620
Don't let them alcohol light you.

2622
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:58,280
You're right.

2623
02:31:58,840 --> 02:32:03,389
I'm not even sure I can take any.

2624
02:32:03,389 --> 02:32:05,069
I don't think I could even take any, guys.

2625
02:32:05,069 --> 02:32:09,500
I don't think it's not going to fit.

2626
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:09,979
I'll try.

2627
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:12,090
Try the back seat.

2628
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:12,569
I'll try.

2629
02:32:12,569 --> 02:32:13,690
Which of this one here has what?

2630
02:32:13,690 --> 02:32:14,409
Where is it right here?

2631
02:32:16,319 --> 02:32:16,639
All right.

2632
02:32:16,639 --> 02:32:16,959
This one.

2633
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:17,840
Let's go.

2634
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:20,799
Put it on the roof?

2635
02:32:24,829 --> 02:32:26,510
You're going to physics the fuck out of the car.

2636
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:28,879
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

2637
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:30,000
Can I mount it to something?

2638
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:35,979
I don't think that's going to work.

2639
02:32:37,879 --> 02:32:38,760
Save the game.

2640
02:32:41,610 --> 02:32:42,250
Save.

2641
02:32:42,250 --> 02:32:53,639
Can I take the seats out?

2642
02:32:53,639 --> 02:32:55,469
All right.

2643
02:32:55,469 --> 02:32:56,750
Let's get slow down.

2644
02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:58,030
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

2645
02:32:58,030 --> 02:32:58,989
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

2646
02:32:58,989 --> 02:32:59,950
Please, please, please, please, please.

2647
02:32:59,950 --> 02:33:00,110
Okay.

2648
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:00,670
Take the door off.

2649
02:33:09,049 --> 02:33:09,850
I thought that was going to kill me.

2650
02:33:09,850 --> 02:33:10,969
I was about to be so annoyed.

2651
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:12,010
All right.

2652
02:33:12,010 --> 02:33:12,329
Okay.

2653
02:33:12,329 --> 02:33:13,049
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2654
02:33:13,049 --> 02:33:14,329
We can actually do this now.

2655
02:33:14,329 --> 02:33:16,520
We just need to move some things around.

2656
02:33:17,079 --> 02:33:22,520
The spare tire is going to have to leave.

2657
02:33:22,520 --> 02:33:23,079
Sorry.

2658
02:33:23,079 --> 02:33:23,959
Useless.

2659
02:33:23,959 --> 02:33:29,840
Okay.

2660
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:30,479
What is in here?

2661
02:33:34,729 --> 02:33:35,530
This is water.

2662
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:38,319
Gas.

2663
02:33:40,559 --> 02:33:41,520
And is that oil?

2664
02:33:42,079 --> 02:33:45,159
I'd really like to pick that up.

2665
02:33:45,159 --> 02:33:55,389
Why can I not pick this up?

2666
02:33:58,909 --> 02:33:59,549
Pick up the oil.

2667
02:34:19,069 --> 02:34:19,389
Yes.

2668
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:22,399
We might be able to get another one in here.

2669
02:34:22,399 --> 02:34:30,620
All right.

2670
02:34:30,620 --> 02:34:31,420
So what should I take?

2671
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:31,739
The alcohol?

2672
02:34:31,739 --> 02:34:32,700
What should I take?

2673
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:37,180
Like packing for a trip.

2674
02:34:37,180 --> 02:34:38,059
Hold on.

2675
02:34:38,059 --> 02:34:46,540
These are all sealed up, right?

2676
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:58,649
Yeah.

2677
02:34:58,649 --> 02:35:01,319
Okay.

2678
02:35:01,319 --> 02:35:02,360
Take the tire.

2679
02:35:02,360 --> 02:35:05,680
Let me put it back together again.

2680
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:14,729
Why is that?

2681
02:35:14,729 --> 02:35:15,129
What?

2682
02:35:15,129 --> 02:35:15,770
What's the?

2683
02:35:15,770 --> 02:35:18,299
We have lots of advice friends.

2684
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:21,799
It's okay.

2685
02:35:21,799 --> 02:35:23,040
It's good.

2686
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:24,079
No, I can't take the tire.

2687
02:35:24,079 --> 02:35:24,879
I'm not going to be able to fit in that.

2688
02:35:24,879 --> 02:35:25,120
Wait.

2689
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,239
I can take the front seat out.

2690
02:35:27,239 --> 02:35:27,559
Wait.

2691
02:35:27,559 --> 02:35:29,079
Can I just take out both seats?

2692
02:35:29,079 --> 02:35:36,000
I can't.

2693
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:41,200
No, I can't take the seats out.

2694
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:41,600
All right.

2695
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:42,719
I think I can still fit it.

2696
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:45,309
So do I take the alcohol?

2697
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:54,000
Yes.

2698
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:54,479
Okay.

2699
02:35:54,479 --> 02:36:05,950
Give me the door.

2700
02:36:05,950 --> 02:36:06,350
Give me the door.

2701
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:06,670
Give me the door.

2702
02:36:06,670 --> 02:36:07,389
Where's the door?

2703
02:36:07,389 --> 02:36:08,639
Where's the door?

2704
02:36:08,639 --> 02:36:09,440
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

2705
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:09,840
Give me the door.

2706
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:10,799
Give me the door.

2707
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:18,059
That's a couch.

2708
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:25,440
Shit.

2709
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:26,000
Okay.

2710
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:51,149
I got it.

2711
02:36:51,149 --> 02:36:51,870
It was in there too.

2712
02:36:51,870 --> 02:36:53,469
I just couldn't put the fucking door on.

2713
02:36:53,469 --> 02:37:06,569
Just leave it.

2714
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:15,049
But fuck it.

2715
02:37:15,049 --> 02:37:15,370
Let's go.

2716
02:37:15,370 --> 02:37:16,010
I have to leave.

2717
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:29,870
Put it on.

2718
02:37:29,870 --> 02:37:32,670
Put on the stupid pain.

2719
02:37:35,149 --> 02:37:36,270
Come on, man.

2720
02:37:38,459 --> 02:37:39,739
Put it on.

2721
02:37:39,739 --> 02:37:40,940
You're killing me.

2722
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:50,750
Put it on.

2723
02:37:50,750 --> 02:37:53,020
I gotta piss.

2724
02:37:53,020 --> 02:37:54,120
Give me a sec.

2725
02:37:54,120 --> 02:42:55,069
I'll be right back.

2726
02:42:55,069 --> 02:42:55,950
Oh, shit.

2727
02:42:55,950 --> 02:42:57,229
Viewers dropping.

2728
02:42:59,370 --> 02:43:00,010
Five minutes.

2729
02:43:00,969 --> 02:43:08,379
There ain't gonna be anybody left.

2730
02:43:08,379 --> 02:43:09,639
Shit.

2731
02:43:09,639 --> 02:43:10,600
Don't I know?

2732
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:12,840
Don't ever go to the bathroom on stream.

2733
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:14,799
Especially with the camera on.

2734
02:43:14,799 --> 02:43:17,739
I'm thinking, Jeremy.

2735
02:43:17,739 --> 02:43:18,459
Fucking idiot.

2736
02:43:22,219 --> 02:43:24,920
Somebody just wrote, fuck him.

2737
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:25,559
Well, no.

2738
02:43:25,559 --> 02:43:26,520
I'm not gonna say that

2739
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:29,870
because, you look, I'm not gonna...

2740
02:43:29,870 --> 02:43:31,950
Look, I'm at a BRB screen for five minutes.

2741
02:43:31,950 --> 02:43:33,680
Oh, I guess I'll wait.

2742
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,040
No, there's other shit to do.

2743
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:37,440
All right.

2744
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,399
What was I doing?

2745
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:43,069
Do I use a random number generator

2746
02:43:43,069 --> 02:43:46,120
to choose games?

2747
02:43:46,120 --> 02:43:47,209
All right.

2748
02:43:47,209 --> 02:43:48,969
That motherfucker right there

2749
02:43:48,969 --> 02:43:50,170
just almost turned on

2750
02:43:50,170 --> 02:43:52,090
Ratatouille for the Xbox 360.

2751
02:43:52,090 --> 02:43:54,030
I was about to press the button.

2752
02:43:54,030 --> 02:43:55,309
It was one second away.

2753
02:43:59,629 --> 02:44:00,750
But I'm gonna press it.

2754
02:44:00,750 --> 02:44:01,629
I think I'm gonna hold off.

2755
02:44:01,629 --> 02:44:04,219
Don't do it.

2756
02:44:04,219 --> 02:44:04,540
Okay.

2757
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:05,100
Car tire.

2758
02:44:08,010 --> 02:44:08,809
Found.

2759
02:44:08,809 --> 02:44:11,120
You know what?

2760
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:12,159
I'm just gonna do this in the morning

2761
02:44:13,049 --> 02:44:13,690
when I can see.

2762
02:44:14,649 --> 02:44:15,610
Just go to the fucking bed.

2763
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:19,020
I'll do it in the morning.

2764
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:19,659
Oh, cat.

2765
02:44:19,659 --> 02:44:20,700
There's an alien cat.

2766
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:21,659
Oh, boy.

2767
02:44:21,659 --> 02:44:22,540
Oh, boy.

2768
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:23,340
Oh, boy.

2769
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:24,540
Oh, there's an alien cat.

2770
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:25,420
I don't know where he is.

2771
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:28,219
I don't know why I'm talking like this.

2772
02:44:30,649 --> 02:44:30,889
What?

2773
02:44:30,889 --> 02:44:31,690
Is the door open?

2774
02:44:31,690 --> 02:44:34,190
How many doors are open?

2775
02:44:34,190 --> 02:44:39,420
Okay.

2776
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:41,260
If I don't move, he won't see me.

2777
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:44,750
I'm not gonna die.

2778
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:54,489
I'm alive.

2779
02:45:02,139 --> 02:45:02,940
Okay.

2780
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:04,139
All the doors were open.

2781
02:45:04,139 --> 02:45:05,579
Well, that's great.

2782
02:45:05,579 --> 02:45:12,590
Let's continue what I was trying to do before.

2783
02:45:15,399 --> 02:45:18,200
Why can't this go on?

2784
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:21,739
Oh, well, that's why.

2785
02:45:21,739 --> 02:45:22,780
It was dark.

2786
02:45:22,780 --> 02:45:23,819
Give me a break.

2787
02:45:23,819 --> 02:45:25,659
Well, you tried to do that shit in the dark.

2788
02:45:25,659 --> 02:45:31,959
Ain't gonna happen.

2789
02:45:31,959 --> 02:45:32,520
Good.

2790
02:45:32,520 --> 02:45:36,280
Should I take the chocolate?

2791
02:45:36,280 --> 02:45:36,520
No.

2792
02:45:37,159 --> 02:45:38,200
It's too much.

2793
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:45,520
We're good.

2794
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,639
We're completely loaded up.

2795
02:45:46,639 --> 02:45:47,440
I got gas.

2796
02:45:47,440 --> 02:45:50,120
I got alcohol.

2797
02:45:50,120 --> 02:45:56,110
Bring Wilson.

2798
02:45:56,110 --> 02:46:00,120
Wilson left.

2799
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:00,440
All right.

2800
02:46:00,440 --> 02:46:01,239
Is everybody ready?

2801
02:46:09,549 --> 02:46:11,149
Back to the road, boys and girls.

2802
02:46:11,149 --> 02:46:12,030
Let's go.

2803
02:46:12,030 --> 02:46:15,790
Full tank of gas.

2804
02:46:15,790 --> 02:46:22,700
Whoever's texting me.

2805
02:46:22,700 --> 02:46:26,680
I can't talk to you.

2806
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:31,840
Oh, we got to get back on the road, which is this way.

2807
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:43,200
I don't like that view.

2808
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:46,620
This is fine.

2809
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:51,479
No, this is kind of how I sit in the car, like right here.

2810
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:52,360
All right.

2811
02:46:52,360 --> 02:46:52,680
That's good.

2812
02:46:54,620 --> 02:46:55,340
Left, idiot.

2813
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:57,180
I'm adjusting my shit.

2814
02:47:07,319 --> 02:47:08,360
No, that's one guy.

2815
02:47:09,159 --> 02:47:10,200
Ban that guy.

2816
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:10,840
All right.

2817
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:11,639
Ban that person.

2818
02:47:11,639 --> 02:47:12,280
Actually ban them.

2819
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:15,159
We need to start.

2820
02:47:15,159 --> 02:47:17,959
There has to be consequences for one guy fuckery.

2821
02:47:24,170 --> 02:47:28,489
And then unban him and give him a $60,000 a year salary.

2822
02:47:28,489 --> 02:47:31,309
And then fire him.

2823
02:47:31,870 --> 02:47:36,760
And then invite him to your birthday party.

2824
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:38,959
And then don't show up.

2825
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:54,479
Yeah, a $60,000 a year salary working 12 seconds.

2826
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:55,819
All right.

2827
02:47:55,819 --> 02:47:56,620
What's the math there?

2828
02:47:57,719 --> 02:47:59,719
Is it like 12 cents?

2829
02:48:00,360 --> 02:48:02,010
Where am I going?

2830
02:48:10,719 --> 02:48:11,520
Where's the road?

2831
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:16,190
Go back to the ship.

2832
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:18,190
No, I need to go back to the road.

2833
02:48:18,190 --> 02:48:19,229
I'm going to be lost.

2834
02:48:19,229 --> 02:48:20,270
I need a GPS.

2835
02:48:20,829 --> 02:48:22,270
I need like a compass or something.

2836
02:48:22,989 --> 02:48:24,030
Stop doing that.

2837
02:48:24,670 --> 02:48:27,229
It has to get out of my way.

2838
02:48:27,229 --> 02:48:27,870
I'll keep doing it.

2839
02:48:28,430 --> 02:48:33,850
Let's find the lampposts.

2840
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:41,530
Wrong fucking way.

2841
02:48:41,530 --> 02:48:43,049
Rip, rip it off.

2842
02:48:44,219 --> 02:48:44,780
Good idea.

2843
02:48:48,559 --> 02:48:49,760
Now there's no distraction.

2844
02:48:50,319 --> 02:48:57,879
Where's this ship?

2845
02:48:57,879 --> 02:48:58,120
All right.

2846
02:48:58,120 --> 02:49:01,159
Yeah, I got to find the ship because the ship is going to give me a good indicator of where I am.

2847
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:02,680
Okay.

2848
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:03,799
So it's this way.

2849
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:06,590
I don't know.

2850
02:49:07,149 --> 02:49:13,049
Turn on the radio for fuck's sake.

2851
02:49:13,690 --> 02:49:19,530
There's nothing on here.

2852
02:49:21,260 --> 02:49:21,659
Jesus.

2853
02:49:22,299 --> 02:49:34,840
I got plenty of gas to find the road, okay?

2854
02:49:37,819 --> 02:49:38,780
Your car sucks.

2855
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:40,079
Oh, yeah?

2856
02:49:40,719 --> 02:49:42,170
Look at all the materials I have.

2857
02:49:45,549 --> 02:49:46,750
Turn fucking right.

2858
02:49:49,899 --> 02:49:51,100
Where's the road?

2859
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:01,469
Smooth as silk.

2860
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:05,920
Right, right, right, right.

2861
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:14,639
Oh, I see it.

2862
02:50:14,639 --> 02:50:15,360
Okay, we're good.

2863
02:50:15,360 --> 02:50:15,920
I see the road.

2864
02:50:35,370 --> 02:50:44,600
I'm driving into the sun.

2865
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:45,879
That's the road right there, right?

2866
02:50:45,879 --> 02:50:48,600
With all those lamps and all those things.

2867
02:50:49,159 --> 02:50:55,239
Am I leaving the map?

2868
02:50:55,239 --> 02:50:55,879
No, I'm right here.

2869
02:50:55,879 --> 02:50:56,600
We are right there.

2870
02:50:56,600 --> 02:50:58,040
That deserves one coffee sip.

2871
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:09,159
Find somebody that can fucking do what I just did.

2872
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:11,000
You never will.

2873
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,520
I'm the only one that could have just done that.

2874
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:13,319
Only person on earth.

2875
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:17,260
Talk about my reaction time behind the wheel.

2876
02:51:18,059 --> 02:51:27,370
All right.

2877
02:51:27,370 --> 02:51:29,530
So is it left or right?

2878
02:51:30,329 --> 02:51:31,450
The correct road.

2879
02:51:32,090 --> 02:51:34,159
Which way?

2880
02:51:34,239 --> 02:51:34,879
Left or right?

2881
02:51:39,360 --> 02:51:40,239
I have no idea.

2882
02:51:44,350 --> 02:51:45,389
Right, MLG.

2883
02:51:45,389 --> 02:51:46,430
Right, MLG.

2884
02:51:46,430 --> 02:51:49,690
Is it 50-50?

2885
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:54,559
Yeah, I'm getting kind of a lot of answers here that I don't know.

2886
02:51:58,670 --> 02:52:00,909
Left, then right, then mod him, then ban him.

2887
02:52:10,809 --> 02:52:11,129
All right.

2888
02:52:11,129 --> 02:52:11,850
Yeah, there's the boat.

2889
02:52:24,030 --> 02:52:25,549
Keep the poles on the right.

2890
02:52:26,350 --> 02:52:27,549
That's how you know you're going the right way?

2891
02:52:28,270 --> 02:52:31,600
I don't know how fast I'm going.

2892
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:32,799
I don't have a speedometer anymore.

2893
02:52:35,079 --> 02:52:37,639
Tiny little rock in the road almost just ruined everything.

2894
02:52:37,639 --> 02:52:38,280
Slow down.

2895
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:39,479
No reason to go that fast.

2896
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:47,659
Go faster.

2897
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:50,750
The faster I go, the faster this run ends.

2898
02:52:57,020 --> 02:53:02,969
Okay, one kilometer in American toddler-speak is what?

2899
02:53:02,969 --> 02:53:04,170
Two, three miles?

2900
02:53:04,170 --> 02:53:05,049
Two miles?

2901
02:53:05,049 --> 02:53:06,809
2.2 miles for one kilometer.

2902
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:14,760
Oh, that's pounds to metric tons or something.

2903
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:15,639
Was it pounds to?

2904
02:53:16,360 --> 02:53:17,079
What is 2.2?

2905
02:53:17,079 --> 02:53:17,799
2.2?

2906
02:53:17,799 --> 02:53:19,399
One kilogram is one pound.

2907
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:21,159
Slow down.

2908
02:53:21,799 --> 02:53:25,260
Oh, pog car.

2909
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:25,899
Pog car.

2910
02:53:26,780 --> 02:53:28,520
Wait, there's no...

2911
02:53:29,239 --> 02:53:31,680
I don't have a mirror.

2912
02:53:47,360 --> 02:53:48,319
All right, let's go back here.

2913
02:53:48,319 --> 02:53:49,200
What is over here?

2914
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:53,239
Oh, get out.

2915
02:53:53,239 --> 02:53:54,200
What am I getting back in for?

2916
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,760
Don't turn that back on, stupid.

2917
02:53:57,760 --> 02:54:00,799
All right, we have a yellow car.

2918
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:03,040
It looks like it could be a little faster.

2919
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:03,600
We also have a...

2920
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:11,850
What is in here?

2921
02:54:11,850 --> 02:54:14,010
Okay, this is disgusting.

2922
02:54:14,010 --> 02:54:15,659
But I'm going to take the gold bar.

2923
02:54:15,659 --> 02:54:16,540
Like, this is just...

2924
02:54:16,540 --> 02:54:17,340
This is gross.

2925
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:18,139
This is disgusting.

2926
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:20,479
How would you miss that much?

2927
02:54:20,479 --> 02:54:21,360
Like, I don't know.

2928
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:21,920
Are you like...

2929
02:54:22,639 --> 02:54:24,000
Are you sitting up here?

2930
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,340
And then...

2931
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:26,379
I don't understand how you do that.

2932
02:54:28,219 --> 02:54:29,500
Take the gold bar, though, for sure.

2933
02:54:30,219 --> 02:54:31,420
All right, what do we got in this car?

2934
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:34,110
Good trunk space.

2935
02:54:34,110 --> 02:54:35,149
Okay, like it.

2936
02:54:35,149 --> 02:54:37,049
Take the gold.

2937
02:54:37,049 --> 02:54:42,760
Okay, what else we got?

2938
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:45,000
Ooh, look at this leather interior.

2939
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,850
We're going to change the doors out.

2940
02:54:47,850 --> 02:54:50,280
Ooh, nice leather seats.

2941
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:52,239
This thing is shiny.

2942
02:54:52,239 --> 02:54:57,629
What do we got under the hood?

2943
02:54:57,629 --> 02:55:02,780
V6 with an injector, with a piston injection.

2944
02:55:02,780 --> 02:55:04,139
Really, really cool, actually.

2945
02:55:04,139 --> 02:55:10,319
All right, let's fill this up.

2946
02:55:10,319 --> 02:55:11,850
Definitely a better car.

2947
02:55:11,850 --> 02:55:14,409
Wait, what's inside of the weird, scary cement...

2948
02:55:19,799 --> 02:55:20,920
Ooh, a new door.

2949
02:55:20,920 --> 02:55:25,440
There's a blue door.

2950
02:55:25,440 --> 02:55:26,399
Who cares, though?

2951
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:30,700
What is this?

2952
02:55:30,700 --> 02:55:34,969
Ooh, a new hood.

2953
02:55:34,969 --> 02:55:35,770
Put it on.

2954
02:55:35,770 --> 02:55:37,770
I can, but hold on.

2955
02:55:37,770 --> 02:55:44,670
Okay, turn the lights on.

2956
02:55:44,670 --> 02:55:45,309
Don't turn them off.

2957
02:55:45,309 --> 02:55:48,909
That hurts.

2958
02:55:48,909 --> 02:55:49,709
Use the new car.

2959
02:55:49,709 --> 02:55:50,510
I'm gonna...

2960
02:55:50,510 --> 02:55:52,079
What do you mean, idiot?

2961
02:55:52,079 --> 02:55:53,840
I'm gonna use the new car.

2962
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:55,280
I want to make it look nice.

2963
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:58,750
What's in here?

2964
02:55:58,750 --> 02:55:59,250
All right.

2965
02:56:00,430 --> 02:56:02,270
I don't get out of bed for more than three liters.

2966
02:56:02,270 --> 02:56:02,909
You know what I'm saying?

2967
02:56:06,329 --> 02:56:07,129
I couldn't be cool about it.

2968
02:56:07,129 --> 02:56:08,489
Let's just fucking waste it.

2969
02:56:08,489 --> 02:56:14,639
Okay, I might need this.

2970
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:26,079
It's an emergency light.

2971
02:56:26,079 --> 02:56:26,959
How many times have you seen me go,

2972
02:56:26,959 --> 02:56:29,520
Whoa, I can't see anything.

2973
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:30,000
All right.

2974
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:37,870
What's in here?

2975
02:56:37,870 --> 02:56:38,350
Ooh, shit.

2976
02:56:38,350 --> 02:56:40,270
What's that?

2977
02:56:40,270 --> 02:56:40,829
No.

2978
02:56:40,829 --> 02:56:42,430
What's this?

2979
02:56:42,430 --> 02:56:47,930
Do you need any new dashboards in here?

2980
02:56:47,930 --> 02:57:12,270
It's so far away.

2981
02:57:12,909 --> 02:57:15,389
Why am I just such a fucking idiot?

2982
02:57:15,389 --> 02:57:17,149
It was so far away.

2983
02:57:17,149 --> 02:57:18,829
I'll make a sad explosion.

2984
02:57:22,459 --> 02:57:23,500
Wow.

2985
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:25,979
I thought it was gonna be so much smaller than that.

2986
02:57:25,979 --> 02:57:26,860
Was it worth it?

2987
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:27,100
No.

2988
02:57:27,659 --> 02:57:29,739
When was the last autosave?

2989
02:57:29,739 --> 02:57:31,739
Oh, thank God.

2990
02:57:31,739 --> 02:57:37,450
Thank God the game is understanding.

2991
02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:38,250
Holy shit.

2992
02:57:38,250 --> 02:57:39,530
That was awful.

2993
02:57:39,530 --> 02:57:40,010
I'm so...

2994
02:57:40,809 --> 02:57:42,090
Every emotion just happened.

2995
02:57:42,090 --> 02:57:51,319
What's this?

2996
02:57:51,319 --> 02:57:52,520
What's on her mind?

2997
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:53,719
Free poster inside.

2998
02:57:53,719 --> 02:57:56,399
Oh, as if I get a poster.

2999
02:57:56,399 --> 02:58:02,520
1987 interview with the new rock star.

3000
02:58:02,520 --> 02:58:14,959
Yeah, I'll store it up there.

3001
02:58:14,959 --> 02:58:15,680
Just get me away from it.

3002
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:16,159
I don't want it.

3003
02:58:16,159 --> 02:58:18,319
Okay, let's do some work here.

3004
02:58:22,440 --> 02:58:23,159
Where's the other car?

3005
02:58:23,719 --> 02:58:25,280
Let's bring this over here.

3006
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:32,299
Use the old car back on the roof.

3007
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:34,479
What is on the roof?

3008
02:58:34,479 --> 02:58:34,959
What is that?

3009
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:44,000
What's that?

3010
02:58:44,719 --> 02:58:53,020
Wrong fucking way.

3011
02:58:53,020 --> 02:58:53,579
What?

3012
02:58:53,579 --> 02:58:57,879
What did I do?

3013
02:58:57,879 --> 02:58:58,120
Where?

3014
02:58:58,120 --> 02:59:00,889
How do they...

3015
02:59:00,889 --> 02:59:01,930
The bed.

3016
02:59:01,930 --> 02:59:04,959
Do I bring the bed?

3017
02:59:11,260 --> 02:59:13,950
Oil.

3018
02:59:13,950 --> 02:59:14,590
You know what I'm saying.

3019
02:59:14,590 --> 02:59:18,430
I don't even fucking get out of bed for more than...

3020
02:59:18,430 --> 02:59:19,069
Whatever.

3021
02:59:19,069 --> 02:59:22,110
What's this?

3022
02:59:22,110 --> 02:59:27,899
Rockboard?

3023
02:59:27,899 --> 02:59:28,540
Easel?

3024
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:38,840
All right, nothing up here.

3025
02:59:38,840 --> 02:59:40,120
We gotta hurry this up though.

3026
02:59:40,120 --> 02:59:44,079
I need to fill the oil tank.

3027
02:59:44,079 --> 02:59:45,600
I got oil.

3028
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:46,799
I got oil in this thing.

3029
02:59:46,799 --> 02:59:52,329
How do I smoke one of these cigarettes?

3030
02:59:52,329 --> 02:59:52,809
Can you?

3031
02:59:52,809 --> 02:59:54,520
What's the point of having this?

3032
02:59:54,520 --> 03:00:00,329
Use stave with the old car.

3033
03:00:00,329 --> 03:00:02,280
What do you mean use the old car?

3034
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:03,399
This thing sucks.

3035
03:00:03,399 --> 03:00:10,540
This thing is gonna be faster and more efficient.

3036
03:00:10,540 --> 03:00:12,379
It has more storage.

3037
03:00:12,379 --> 03:00:18,590
Hey, but look at this.

3038
03:00:18,590 --> 03:00:19,879
That's stupid.

3039
03:00:19,879 --> 03:00:20,680
It's stupid.

3040
03:00:20,680 --> 03:00:23,309
It's not cool.

3041
03:00:23,309 --> 03:00:25,469
I can fit some of the gas tanks in here.

3042
03:00:25,469 --> 03:00:26,969
I'm gonna dump this whole thing.

3043
03:00:26,969 --> 03:00:28,540
This is gas, right?

3044
03:00:28,540 --> 03:00:30,670
Fellas.

3045
03:00:30,670 --> 03:00:33,309
Just check me out.

3046
03:00:33,309 --> 03:00:34,030
You can't.

3047
03:00:34,030 --> 03:00:34,670
You're stupid.

3048
03:00:34,670 --> 03:00:35,870
What do you mean no, you can't?

3049
03:00:35,870 --> 03:00:43,290
How much gas?

3050
03:00:43,290 --> 03:00:43,770
Oil?

3051
03:00:43,770 --> 03:00:44,329
Coolant?

3052
03:00:44,329 --> 03:00:46,670
Yeah, I'll be good.

3053
03:00:46,670 --> 03:00:47,309
You're stupid.

3054
03:00:47,309 --> 03:00:47,870
What the fuck?

3055
03:00:47,870 --> 03:00:49,069
You don't have oil.

3056
03:00:49,069 --> 03:00:49,629
Yes, I do.

3057
03:00:52,319 --> 03:00:58,479
This is gas, gas, and water.

3058
03:00:58,479 --> 03:01:00,059
I don't have any oil.

3059
03:01:00,059 --> 03:01:00,379
Okay.

3060
03:01:00,379 --> 03:01:01,500
I'm taking the fucking...

3061
03:01:01,500 --> 03:01:01,979
All right.

3062
03:01:01,979 --> 03:01:06,239
I'm taking all the cool stuff though.

3063
03:01:06,239 --> 03:01:11,959
It's too late to do this.

3064
03:01:11,959 --> 03:01:22,280
Get in and sleep.

3065
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:23,479
Sleep in the bed.

3066
03:01:32,559 --> 03:01:33,200
All right.

3067
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:38,329
Give me the gun.

3068
03:01:38,329 --> 03:01:38,969
Give me the gun.

3069
03:01:38,969 --> 03:01:44,190
All right.

3070
03:01:44,190 --> 03:01:47,790
The monsters are stupid in this game.

3071
03:01:47,790 --> 03:01:50,329
Okay.

3072
03:01:50,329 --> 03:01:52,889
Let me replace some of this shit.

3073
03:01:52,889 --> 03:01:53,690
I want some new...

3074
03:01:54,940 --> 03:01:56,059
Oh, look at that.

3075
03:01:56,059 --> 03:01:59,440
Wait, this was already on there.

3076
03:01:59,440 --> 03:01:59,920
There we go.

3077
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:01,440
The nice blue, new blue one.

3078
03:02:01,440 --> 03:02:10,409
Nice.

3079
03:02:10,409 --> 03:02:11,049
Okay.

3080
03:02:11,049 --> 03:02:12,840
And then where's the other blue one?

3081
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:16,649
Gross.

3082
03:02:16,649 --> 03:02:22,010
It's the new hood.

3083
03:02:22,010 --> 03:02:23,209
Is this the...

3084
03:02:23,209 --> 03:02:24,250
No, where's the blue hood?

3085
03:02:24,250 --> 03:02:36,479
Please take the new car.

3086
03:02:36,479 --> 03:02:37,680
Fuck what Chad is saying.

3087
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:38,239
I can't.

3088
03:02:38,239 --> 03:02:38,959
I don't have any oil.

3089
03:02:38,959 --> 03:02:52,000
Why are my hands doing this, by the way?

3090
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:55,469
I feel like I'm playing VR.

3091
03:02:55,469 --> 03:02:56,590
Why are my hands doing this?

3092
03:02:56,590 --> 03:03:10,569
All right, mount it.

3093
03:03:10,569 --> 03:03:16,520
I want this fucking thing.

3094
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:23,129
What the hell?

3095
03:03:23,129 --> 03:03:24,170
Wrong door?

3096
03:03:24,170 --> 03:03:36,729
Well, what is going on?

3097
03:03:36,729 --> 03:03:39,530
Why can't I put this on?

3098
03:03:39,530 --> 03:03:40,329
Even if it's wrong.

3099
03:03:40,329 --> 03:03:54,489
Here we go.

3100
03:03:54,489 --> 03:03:57,799
Okay.

3101
03:03:57,799 --> 03:03:58,600
And then this is...

3102
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:09,229
I need this door.

3103
03:04:09,229 --> 03:04:10,590
He's so high.

3104
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:14,969
No, he's not.

3105
03:04:14,969 --> 03:04:15,690
He's not.

3106
03:04:30,700 --> 03:04:31,420
This sucks.

3107
03:04:32,139 --> 03:04:33,420
Can I take the bumper off?

3108
03:04:33,420 --> 03:04:37,389
Look at how nice this car is, though.

3109
03:04:37,389 --> 03:04:38,909
This is so sad.

3110
03:04:38,909 --> 03:04:43,690
Okay.

3111
03:04:43,690 --> 03:04:45,450
I need a door to...

3112
03:04:45,450 --> 03:05:20,319
I want this on the trunk, too.

3113
03:05:20,319 --> 03:05:20,719
Perfect.

3114
03:05:20,719 --> 03:05:20,959
All right.

3115
03:05:20,959 --> 03:05:21,680
That fits.

3116
03:05:21,680 --> 03:05:23,290
I just need a door over here.

3117
03:05:23,290 --> 03:05:28,299
I'm gonna eat the poop.

3118
03:05:28,299 --> 03:05:31,209
I want that person timed out

3119
03:05:31,209 --> 03:05:32,329
for at least five minutes.

3120
03:05:32,329 --> 03:05:41,079
There we go.

3121
03:05:41,079 --> 03:05:42,729
Okay.

3122
03:05:42,729 --> 03:05:44,569
It's a two-faced car.

3123
03:05:44,569 --> 03:05:46,719
All right.

3124
03:05:46,719 --> 03:05:47,200
What do you mean?

3125
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:50,879
Like, Batman, Tommy Lee Jones.

3126
03:05:50,879 --> 03:05:51,920
What do you mean?

3127
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:54,670
Barbie Dent from The Dark Knight.

3128
03:05:54,670 --> 03:05:55,309
Which one?

3129
03:05:55,309 --> 03:05:57,719
Probably that one.

3130
03:05:57,719 --> 03:05:59,159
Probably the Tommy Lee Jones one.

3131
03:05:59,159 --> 03:06:09,690
Take the new engine.

3132
03:06:29,719 --> 03:06:30,680
Holy shit.

3133
03:06:38,959 --> 03:06:39,840
Oh, it's oil.

3134
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:41,739
All right.

3135
03:06:41,739 --> 03:06:42,379
Let's go.

3136
03:06:42,379 --> 03:06:44,379
I got everything I needed from here.

3137
03:06:44,379 --> 03:06:45,760
Three doors.

3138
03:06:45,760 --> 03:06:53,200
Give me that fucking thing.

3139
03:06:53,200 --> 03:06:54,239
I might find oil later.

3140
03:06:54,239 --> 03:07:05,790
Take the gold, too?

3141
03:07:05,790 --> 03:07:06,430
Yeah, I will.

3142
03:07:06,430 --> 03:07:27,530
This is heavy.

3143
03:07:27,530 --> 03:07:58,200
Wait, what about...

3144
03:07:58,200 --> 03:07:59,000
Sick.

3145
03:07:59,000 --> 03:07:59,399
Okay.

3146
03:07:59,399 --> 03:07:59,799
What about...

3147
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:01,959
These are all corroded and shitty.

3148
03:08:01,959 --> 03:08:10,920
Tires...

3149
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:12,280
It doesn't matter what tire is what, right?

3150
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:17,930
It's just as long as the tire exists.

3151
03:08:17,930 --> 03:08:29,239
This one's ugly.

3152
03:08:29,239 --> 03:08:29,479
All right.

3153
03:08:29,479 --> 03:08:30,520
This one looks pretty good.

3154
03:08:30,520 --> 03:08:36,280
All right.

3155
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:37,239
Which one's in worse shape?

3156
03:08:37,239 --> 03:08:39,479
Oh, definitely front tire right.

3157
03:08:39,479 --> 03:08:40,360
You know what I mean?

3158
03:08:40,360 --> 03:08:43,389
Front tire right looks like shit.

3159
03:08:43,389 --> 03:08:59,020
Why am I getting minus two for that?

3160
03:08:59,020 --> 03:08:59,260
All right.

3161
03:08:59,260 --> 03:09:00,139
Take the dashboard.

3162
03:09:00,139 --> 03:09:01,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3163
03:09:01,260 --> 03:09:02,459
And the steering wheel.

3164
03:09:02,459 --> 03:09:05,149
And everything else.

3165
03:09:05,149 --> 03:09:06,750
Take the speedometer.

3166
03:09:06,750 --> 03:09:10,040
This doesn't even fit in my car.

3167
03:09:10,040 --> 03:09:13,520
All right.

3168
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:14,639
What if I just leave it here?

3169
03:09:14,639 --> 03:09:20,889
Will it still work?

3170
03:09:20,889 --> 03:09:21,850
Just hold it.

3171
03:09:24,030 --> 03:09:24,590
No, I can't.

3172
03:09:24,590 --> 03:09:26,600
There's a hole in the...

3173
03:09:26,600 --> 03:09:32,780
Oh, hold it in your hand.

3174
03:09:32,780 --> 03:09:39,790
All right.

3175
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:40,510
Here we go.

3176
03:09:40,510 --> 03:09:42,700
Does it work?

3177
03:09:42,700 --> 03:09:50,440
No, it don't work.

3178
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:51,399
It looks kind of cool over there.

3179
03:09:51,399 --> 03:09:51,559
All right.

3180
03:09:51,559 --> 03:09:52,280
Let's move.

3181
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:56,030
What about the radio?

3182
03:09:56,030 --> 03:09:56,590
I don't want...

3183
03:09:56,590 --> 03:09:57,069
Who cares?

3184
03:09:57,069 --> 03:09:57,389
I don't want...

3185
03:10:02,270 --> 03:10:04,430
Don't move.

3186
03:10:04,430 --> 03:10:11,319
Did this car just stall out?

3187
03:10:11,319 --> 03:10:19,979
I can't take the steering wheel.

3188
03:10:19,979 --> 03:10:21,420
I can't take the steering wheel.

3189
03:10:21,420 --> 03:10:26,649
Can I?

3190
03:10:26,649 --> 03:10:31,790
Review mirror.

3191
03:10:31,790 --> 03:10:32,430
Oh, shit.

3192
03:10:32,430 --> 03:10:32,909
Nice.

3193
03:10:32,909 --> 03:11:08,010
Okay.

3194
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:08,569
It looks good.

3195
03:11:14,350 --> 03:11:25,129
Good thing out of here.

3196
03:11:25,129 --> 03:11:25,370
All right.

3197
03:11:25,370 --> 03:11:28,399
I need to get back on the road.

3198
03:11:28,399 --> 03:11:29,200
Radio?

3199
03:11:29,200 --> 03:11:32,829
All right.

3200
03:11:32,829 --> 03:11:33,709
It was this way.

3201
03:11:33,709 --> 03:11:36,379
I forgot about the bed.

3202
03:11:36,379 --> 03:11:38,059
I can't put the bed anywhere.

3203
03:11:38,059 --> 03:11:42,120
Was it this way?

3204
03:11:42,120 --> 03:11:43,159
No, it was the other way, wasn't it?

3205
03:11:43,159 --> 03:11:43,959
No, wait.

3206
03:11:43,959 --> 03:11:44,600
Wrong way.

3207
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:45,239
Yeah.

3208
03:11:45,239 --> 03:11:52,879
Hole's on the right.

3209
03:11:52,879 --> 03:11:54,000
Right, right, right, right.

3210
03:11:54,000 --> 03:12:00,120
All right.

3211
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:00,520
I'll try to...

3212
03:12:00,520 --> 03:12:01,479
I'm going to put the bed on the roof.

3213
03:12:03,899 --> 03:12:06,079
Fuck.

3214
03:12:06,079 --> 03:12:07,760
It's too involved.

3215
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:20,030
Don't turn it on.

3216
03:12:20,030 --> 03:12:20,190
All right.

3217
03:12:20,190 --> 03:12:20,670
Where's the bed?

3218
03:12:23,149 --> 03:12:23,790
Save.

3219
03:12:23,790 --> 03:12:26,090
Um, I don't know.

3220
03:12:26,090 --> 03:12:26,409
Whatever.

3221
03:12:26,409 --> 03:12:27,129
Save right there.

3222
03:12:27,129 --> 03:12:30,010
Why does it...

3223
03:12:30,010 --> 03:12:31,850
Why do I have a negative seed?

3224
03:12:31,850 --> 03:12:45,340
You're infertile.

3225
03:12:48,590 --> 03:12:51,920
Can I actually put this on the car?

3226
03:12:51,920 --> 03:12:54,620
I mean, people do this shit,

3227
03:12:54,620 --> 03:12:56,139
but I don't have any bungees.

3228
03:12:56,139 --> 03:13:10,459
I think it worked.

3229
03:13:10,459 --> 03:13:15,520
And yeah, I'll just...

3230
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,440
This is Snoopy's house.

3231
03:13:17,440 --> 03:13:18,840
When I get tired,

3232
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,639
I'm going to get out of the car,

3233
03:13:19,639 --> 03:13:20,120
climb up here,

3234
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:20,840
lie on my back,

3235
03:13:20,840 --> 03:13:21,799
and fall asleep.

3236
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:37,790
Still up there?

3237
03:13:37,790 --> 03:13:43,149
Yeah, it's on there.

3238
03:13:43,149 --> 03:13:45,610
All right.

3239
03:13:45,610 --> 03:13:50,010
Back on the road.

3240
03:13:50,010 --> 03:13:50,889
The emergency light.

3241
03:13:50,889 --> 03:13:51,370
I don't need it.

3242
03:13:51,370 --> 03:13:52,090
I'm fine.

3243
03:13:52,090 --> 03:13:52,329
I'm fine.

3244
03:13:52,329 --> 03:13:53,770
I have all the nice supplies.

3245
03:13:53,770 --> 03:13:56,809
All right.

3246
03:13:56,809 --> 03:14:10,590
Hole's on the right.

3247
03:14:10,590 --> 03:14:11,149
Is there a horn?

3248
03:14:21,370 --> 03:14:21,690
H?

3249
03:14:23,319 --> 03:14:24,040
There is a horn.

3250
03:14:26,639 --> 03:14:26,959
Bed.

3251
03:14:26,959 --> 03:14:28,239
The bed, the bed, the bed, the bed.

3252
03:14:28,239 --> 03:14:29,200
Don't do anything idiotic.

3253
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:29,520
Don't.

3254
03:14:29,520 --> 03:14:30,000
Okay.

3255
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:30,479
Slow down.

3256
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:34,860
I'm going to have to readjust this bed.

3257
03:14:34,860 --> 03:14:42,079
We've got to take the poop.

3258
03:14:42,079 --> 03:14:42,889
Okay.

3259
03:14:42,889 --> 03:14:44,010
In a different playthrough,

3260
03:14:44,090 --> 03:14:46,170
I would have taken every single shit I found

3261
03:14:46,170 --> 03:14:47,049
and put it in the front seat

3262
03:14:47,049 --> 03:14:48,329
until there's like 400,

3263
03:14:48,329 --> 03:14:49,370
just right here stacked up.

3264
03:14:50,090 --> 03:15:03,440
We could play highway to...

3265
03:15:17,360 --> 03:15:18,559
No damage at all.

3266
03:15:18,559 --> 03:15:20,120
Wait, what did I lose?

3267
03:15:20,120 --> 03:15:22,280
I lost a couple of dinner plates.

3268
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:23,159
I put it back on.

3269
03:15:23,159 --> 03:16:11,920
What about the mirror?

3270
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:20,860
I don't need it.

3271
03:16:20,860 --> 03:16:21,659
Rip mirror.

3272
03:16:22,889 --> 03:16:23,690
Click the link.

3273
03:16:23,690 --> 03:16:24,969
I can't right now.

3274
03:16:24,969 --> 03:16:26,170
When I get to another gas station,

3275
03:16:26,170 --> 03:16:26,969
I'll click the link.

3276
03:16:26,969 --> 03:16:29,319
How much gas does this car have?

3277
03:16:29,959 --> 03:16:31,079
I guess I can go out

3278
03:16:31,079 --> 03:16:32,200
and just reach my hand in

3279
03:16:32,200 --> 03:16:34,520
and see how far the line goes up my arm.

3280
03:16:35,319 --> 03:16:36,440
That's not going to help.

3281
03:16:36,440 --> 03:16:37,639
I can't fucking see.

3282
03:16:39,079 --> 03:16:40,440
Bed to bed to bed to bed to bed.

3283
03:16:41,879 --> 03:16:43,000
I can't see anything.

3284
03:16:43,799 --> 03:16:52,479
No, turn the fucking thing off.

3285
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:53,200
Stop.

3286
03:16:53,200 --> 03:16:54,000
Do not.

3287
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:57,680
Thank you.

3288
03:16:57,680 --> 03:16:58,559
Fuck the bed.

3289
03:16:58,559 --> 03:16:59,040
I need it.

3290
03:16:59,600 --> 03:17:00,879
I need it in about 10 seconds.

3291
03:17:01,440 --> 03:17:14,750
I wish I could tie it down.

3292
03:17:21,520 --> 03:17:21,920
Go on.

3293
03:17:24,700 --> 03:17:34,799
This is good.

3294
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:37,959
This is the farthest I've ever been, by the way.

3295
03:17:38,680 --> 03:17:43,129
I've not gone further than this.

3296
03:17:46,010 --> 03:17:46,809
Grab it?

3297
03:17:46,809 --> 03:17:53,879
What did I just grab?

3298
03:17:53,879 --> 03:17:55,610
What the hell is this?

3299
03:17:58,219 --> 03:17:58,459
All right.

3300
03:17:58,459 --> 03:17:59,500
Where are my lights?

3301
03:17:59,579 --> 03:18:08,090
Why is the road so beat up right now?

3302
03:18:14,250 --> 03:18:15,129
Rip bed.

3303
03:18:15,129 --> 03:18:16,010
What do you mean rip bed?

3304
03:18:16,649 --> 03:18:17,920
It's still up there.

3305
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:19,120
It didn't fall off.

3306
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:20,399
I don't think it did.

3307
03:18:27,930 --> 03:18:37,479
I'm going to get hit by a rock.

3308
03:18:37,479 --> 03:18:38,680
I know it's going to appear.

3309
03:18:38,680 --> 03:18:39,319
I got to slow down.

3310
03:18:49,870 --> 03:18:50,590
It's not.

3311
03:18:50,590 --> 03:18:51,950
I don't think it's even funny anymore.

3312
03:18:52,510 --> 03:19:02,319
Just spam it.

3313
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:06,520
No, I got to.

3314
03:19:07,559 --> 03:19:08,440
That's how you lose the bed.

3315
03:19:09,159 --> 03:19:10,139
How am I spinning?

3316
03:19:10,780 --> 03:19:13,159
That's how you lose the fucking bed.

3317
03:19:13,159 --> 03:19:13,479
Thanks.

3318
03:19:14,200 --> 03:19:15,159
Why did you tell me to do that?

3319
03:19:15,799 --> 03:19:19,229
Where's the bed?

3320
03:19:28,399 --> 03:19:32,159
Uh, the bed is long gone.

3321
03:19:36,639 --> 03:19:37,600
Go on.

3322
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:38,079
Hurry up.

3323
03:19:45,549 --> 03:19:46,670
Buy a cactus.

3324
03:19:46,670 --> 03:19:47,309
What is this?

3325
03:19:47,309 --> 03:19:48,030
It's annoying me.

3326
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:54,350
Why did I drive by?

3327
03:19:58,299 --> 03:19:58,799
You...

3328
03:20:01,309 --> 03:20:01,870
No.

3329
03:20:01,870 --> 03:20:03,149
How am I ever going to sleep?

3330
03:20:05,819 --> 03:20:06,379
All right.

3331
03:20:06,379 --> 03:20:07,819
I got to get the bed.

3332
03:20:07,819 --> 03:20:08,379
You're right.

3333
03:20:08,379 --> 03:20:09,420
I can't just leave it.

3334
03:20:09,420 --> 03:20:11,420
It took all the fucking trouble to go get it.

3335
03:20:24,510 --> 03:20:25,469
Where is it?

3336
03:20:25,469 --> 03:20:33,450
Where?

3337
03:20:39,530 --> 03:20:42,139
All right.

3338
03:20:42,780 --> 03:20:44,139
It's time to go to sleep anyways.

3339
03:20:44,860 --> 03:21:04,010
Get those lights off.

3340
03:21:04,010 --> 03:21:06,170
Leave the fucking bed, you pothead.

3341
03:21:06,170 --> 03:21:07,370
Why am I a pothead?

3342
03:21:09,309 --> 03:21:09,950
What?

3343
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:16,409
Oh, wrong way.

3344
03:21:16,409 --> 03:21:18,170
Leave the bed, you pothead.

3345
03:21:18,729 --> 03:21:22,360
Okay.

3346
03:21:22,360 --> 03:21:23,000
Let's get in it.

3347
03:21:23,639 --> 03:21:24,520
Let's sleep.

3348
03:21:24,520 --> 03:21:29,530
Is this the wrong way?

3349
03:21:30,090 --> 03:21:35,309
I can't tell.

3350
03:21:35,309 --> 03:21:36,350
It's pitch black.

3351
03:21:36,350 --> 03:22:03,319
I really wish somebody could drive the car when I'm sitting here.

3352
03:22:03,319 --> 03:22:03,719
All right.

3353
03:22:04,280 --> 03:22:04,760
Don't worry.

3354
03:22:04,760 --> 03:22:06,920
A bed percent is still strong.

3355
03:22:06,920 --> 03:22:07,399
Don't worry.

3356
03:22:20,860 --> 03:22:21,500
Well, let's go.

3357
03:22:22,139 --> 03:22:34,139
The game is neat.

3358
03:22:34,780 --> 03:22:38,200
Yeah, I mean, this game started as an F.

3359
03:22:38,280 --> 03:22:41,799
It immediately became a D because one full letter grade for a car.

3360
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:48,889
I mean, it's slowly climbed up to at least a C plus somehow.

3361
03:22:52,729 --> 03:22:53,690
Slow down.

3362
03:22:53,690 --> 03:23:00,239
The FOV is fucked.

3363
03:23:00,239 --> 03:23:01,040
Well, it's because I'm...

3364
03:23:02,969 --> 03:23:04,489
Don't tell me I'm fucked up.

3365
03:23:04,489 --> 03:23:05,049
Don't do it.

3366
03:23:05,049 --> 03:23:05,450
Just let it...

3367
03:23:05,450 --> 03:23:06,969
Just let the car do what it wants.

3368
03:23:06,969 --> 03:23:07,930
Don't fight that, okay?

3369
03:23:08,729 --> 03:23:20,879
If I tried to fight that turn, I would have flipped over.

3370
03:23:21,440 --> 03:23:30,559
That would not have happened with the yellow car.

3371
03:23:31,200 --> 03:23:32,479
It really might have, though.

3372
03:23:33,280 --> 03:23:38,909
I got plenty of gas.

3373
03:23:38,909 --> 03:23:40,030
I got all my materials.

3374
03:23:40,030 --> 03:23:41,229
This car is going to make it all the way.

3375
03:23:56,639 --> 03:24:08,600
That's how you style kill somebody.

3376
03:24:08,600 --> 03:24:09,799
Just like tailwhip them.

3377
03:24:11,200 --> 03:24:13,120
360 no scope with a car.

3378
03:24:14,649 --> 03:24:15,290
Sorry.

3379
03:24:15,290 --> 03:24:15,930
Excuse me.

3380
03:24:15,930 --> 03:24:17,049
A bed car.

3381
03:24:18,270 --> 03:24:19,389
Make sure we're accurate here.

3382
03:24:19,950 --> 03:24:22,670
What is that?

3383
03:24:23,309 --> 03:24:26,159
What's that thing on the left?

3384
03:24:32,750 --> 03:24:33,389
Airfield?

3385
03:24:34,030 --> 03:24:37,440
Is it actually an airfield?

3386
03:24:38,540 --> 03:24:39,899
There are no planes in this game, is there?

3387
03:24:40,700 --> 03:24:50,379
Oh, it's just a weirdly popping in cactus.

3388
03:24:59,399 --> 03:25:00,600
Plane car bed.

3389
03:25:05,850 --> 03:25:07,840
Just keep stacking shit on top.

3390
03:25:08,559 --> 03:25:14,219
We got a building right here.

3391
03:25:14,780 --> 03:25:17,229
Let's see.

3392
03:25:18,399 --> 03:25:19,440
All right, take it.

3393
03:25:19,440 --> 03:25:20,879
I'm going way faster than I...

3394
03:25:21,600 --> 03:25:26,440
When you zoom in like that,

3395
03:25:26,440 --> 03:25:38,809
you don't have any idea just how fast you're fucking going.

3396
03:25:38,809 --> 03:25:39,770
Bed joke again.

3397
03:25:39,770 --> 03:25:40,409
Minus two.

3398
03:25:40,969 --> 03:25:42,040
I just...

3399
03:25:42,040 --> 03:25:43,719
Look, I just want to get it to the next safe house

3400
03:25:43,719 --> 03:25:44,520
so I can put it in there.

3401
03:25:49,440 --> 03:25:50,239
I'm not trying...

3402
03:25:50,799 --> 03:25:52,079
I'm not trying to be funny.

3403
03:25:52,079 --> 03:25:52,719
I promise.

3404
03:25:52,719 --> 03:25:53,920
I want to do this.

3405
03:25:55,520 --> 03:25:56,000
This is...

3406
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:57,840
Look, this has nothing to do with me making a joke.

3407
03:25:57,840 --> 03:26:00,479
This has to do with me wanting something.

3408
03:26:00,479 --> 03:26:10,270
I just want to get it over here.

3409
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:13,680
What is...

3410
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:14,799
Is this like a bus stop?

3411
03:26:18,700 --> 03:26:19,979
All right, this is where we're going to drop the bed.

3412
03:26:21,760 --> 03:26:23,280
Okay, you know like in like...

3413
03:26:24,399 --> 03:26:25,280
Spoilers for that...

3414
03:26:25,280 --> 03:26:27,360
What's the Kojima game that came out and everybody...

3415
03:26:27,360 --> 03:26:29,120
Okay, spoiler for Death Stranding.

3416
03:26:29,120 --> 03:26:29,680
Okay, ready?

3417
03:26:30,489 --> 03:26:31,850
I have to put this bed here

3418
03:26:32,569 --> 03:26:35,770
because I want to leave it for another player to come and sleep on the bed.

3419
03:26:36,329 --> 03:26:38,270
Isn't that how that works?

3420
03:26:38,909 --> 03:26:46,350
I just told you I was going to...

3421
03:26:46,350 --> 03:26:47,149
I just told you...

3422
03:26:47,149 --> 03:26:49,149
I'm warning that I was going to talk about Death Stranding for a second.

3423
03:26:49,709 --> 03:26:53,950
Oh, it's like a fort.

3424
03:26:53,950 --> 03:26:54,510
That's a...

3425
03:26:54,510 --> 03:26:55,149
That's pretty cool.

3426
03:26:55,709 --> 03:26:57,709
What's this?

3427
03:27:05,319 --> 03:27:05,959
A toilet?

3428
03:27:06,520 --> 03:27:07,000
Some sort?

3429
03:27:07,719 --> 03:27:08,280
This is nothing...

3430
03:27:08,280 --> 03:27:09,159
This is nothing even here.

3431
03:27:10,280 --> 03:27:11,000
Whoa!

3432
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:21,690
That's a new radiator.

3433
03:27:25,559 --> 03:27:34,649
48 water, 34 oil, 18 alcohol.

3434
03:27:34,649 --> 03:27:37,600
Oh, look at this piece of shit.

3435
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:39,920
This thing sucks.

3436
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:40,719
Coolant tank.

3437
03:27:40,719 --> 03:27:41,360
Oh, wow.

3438
03:27:41,360 --> 03:27:42,639
100% water.

3439
03:27:42,639 --> 03:27:49,340
Not bad.

3440
03:27:49,340 --> 03:27:56,090
All right, I'm going to take it with me in case I need it.

3441
03:27:56,090 --> 03:28:16,799
I just have so many car parts in here.

3442
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:20,639
This is just hoarding but with car vehicle parts.

3443
03:28:20,639 --> 03:28:22,559
Like, why do I have this speedometer that I can't even use?

3444
03:28:23,120 --> 03:28:25,870
What's the point of having this?

3445
03:28:25,870 --> 03:28:27,549
I have an engine that I can't use.

3446
03:28:28,479 --> 03:28:29,520
I have speedometers.

3447
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:32,299
I have wheels left.

3448
03:28:32,299 --> 03:28:37,879
I can't use any of this shit.

3449
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:48,200
Is it a tower?

3450
03:28:48,200 --> 03:28:52,430
There ain't no tower left.

3451
03:28:52,430 --> 03:28:53,069
What are you talking about?

3452
03:28:54,440 --> 03:28:55,000
Is that...

3453
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:56,440
I mean, that's where we're going right now.

3454
03:28:57,000 --> 03:29:02,889
The goal is to go to that weird tea tower.

3455
03:29:03,450 --> 03:29:08,590
What is that?

3456
03:29:08,590 --> 03:29:09,709
Teen Titans tower.

3457
03:29:10,270 --> 03:29:11,209
Oh, wait.

3458
03:29:11,209 --> 03:29:14,170
Are we talking about Teen Titans original or Teen Titans...

3459
03:29:14,809 --> 03:29:20,010
Let's eat tacos and mess around in every episode.

3460
03:29:20,010 --> 03:29:20,809
We don't actually do anything.

3461
03:29:20,809 --> 03:29:24,319
We just eat tacos, right?

3462
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:32,250
You know, it's like, let's fight that enemy versus tacos.

3463
03:29:34,319 --> 03:29:35,600
Which version are you talking about?

3464
03:29:36,079 --> 03:29:52,200
You'll never get away with this, Sandler versus ice cream party.

3465
03:29:53,159 --> 03:29:54,959
What's the guy's name?

3466
03:29:56,559 --> 03:29:57,040
Slap?

3467
03:29:57,040 --> 03:29:57,600
What's his name?

3468
03:29:58,479 --> 03:29:59,819
It's not Sandler.

3469
03:29:59,819 --> 03:30:01,100
I know, but what's his name?

3470
03:30:04,569 --> 03:30:05,129
Slade.

3471
03:30:05,129 --> 03:30:05,450
Yes.

3472
03:30:09,149 --> 03:30:10,190
Slap Sandler.

3473
03:30:16,860 --> 03:30:17,180
Boat.

3474
03:30:20,030 --> 03:30:21,709
Wait, boat or Teen Titans?

3475
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:26,170
There's two boats.

3476
03:30:26,809 --> 03:30:30,250
Teen Titans?

3477
03:30:30,250 --> 03:30:30,489
Okay.

3478
03:30:31,209 --> 03:31:02,280
I don't want to smash into a rock both ways.

3479
03:31:02,280 --> 03:31:03,799
This actually looks kind of interesting.

3480
03:31:03,799 --> 03:31:06,040
This is the most interesting thing so far, this whole playthrough.

3481
03:31:06,760 --> 03:31:11,840
Please stop dri...

3482
03:31:11,840 --> 03:31:12,879
Okay, I can't read.

3483
03:31:12,879 --> 03:31:14,000
Please stop driving so fast.

3484
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:14,799
It's terrifying.

3485
03:31:15,440 --> 03:31:17,200
I'm in complete control of this vehicle.

3486
03:31:18,489 --> 03:31:19,450
Don't worry.

3487
03:31:19,450 --> 03:31:30,909
Just avoid...

3488
03:31:31,629 --> 03:31:33,440
Damn, what is that thing?

3489
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:43,360
Does the horn wear out?

3490
03:31:58,430 --> 03:31:59,229
5G.

3491
03:32:00,030 --> 03:32:01,309
Not a 5G tower.

3492
03:32:02,030 --> 03:32:04,840
You're alerting the horde.

3493
03:32:16,319 --> 03:32:16,719
Witch!

3494
03:32:26,489 --> 03:32:27,290
Am I going fast?

3495
03:32:27,290 --> 03:32:27,530
Yeah.

3496
03:32:28,250 --> 03:32:40,139
All right, let's investigate.

3497
03:32:40,860 --> 03:32:41,659
Off.

3498
03:32:41,659 --> 03:32:42,809
Brake.

3499
03:32:42,809 --> 03:32:47,000
Done.

3500
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:48,959
I'm ready to go.

3501
03:32:48,959 --> 03:32:54,510
Don't go anywhere.

3502
03:33:00,920 --> 03:33:01,799
Well, okay.

3503
03:33:01,799 --> 03:33:03,799
You guys ever stand up to a really tall building?

3504
03:33:03,799 --> 03:33:05,239
Go like this and look straight up.

3505
03:33:05,239 --> 03:33:06,760
You will fall backwards.

3506
03:33:06,760 --> 03:33:08,280
Your body, it's like an equilibrium thing.

3507
03:33:08,280 --> 03:33:09,159
You'll fall all the way backwards.

3508
03:33:09,159 --> 03:33:15,799
Don't do it.

3509
03:33:15,799 --> 03:33:18,989
Your door?

3510
03:33:18,989 --> 03:33:20,459
Wait a minute.

3511
03:33:20,459 --> 03:33:21,100
What is this?

3512
03:33:21,100 --> 03:33:25,420
Why can I turn that?

3513
03:33:25,420 --> 03:33:28,219
What is the point?

3514
03:33:28,219 --> 03:33:32,329
This is a water tank.

3515
03:33:32,329 --> 03:33:32,569
What?

3516
03:33:45,129 --> 03:33:51,399
All right, turn it off.

3517
03:33:51,399 --> 03:33:54,920
Turn it off?

3518
03:33:54,920 --> 03:33:58,200
Oh no, I'm going to be the reason why the whole town runs out of water.

3519
03:34:00,590 --> 03:34:02,030
Smooth open close?

3520
03:34:02,590 --> 03:34:05,479
Let's take a shower.

3521
03:34:32,989 --> 03:34:35,149
This is going to be like really fucking weird.

3522
03:34:35,709 --> 03:34:37,770
Hold on.

3523
03:34:37,770 --> 03:34:39,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3524
03:34:39,930 --> 03:34:40,569
Where's my bed?

3525
03:34:41,370 --> 03:34:42,409
Turn this off.

3526
03:34:42,409 --> 03:34:55,520
There's no monsters going to be there.

3527
03:34:55,520 --> 03:34:57,760
I know I left it at the bus stop.

3528
03:34:57,760 --> 03:34:58,079
It's okay.

3529
03:34:58,079 --> 03:35:00,079
There's no monsters over by the water tank.

3530
03:35:00,079 --> 03:35:05,979
Click on the spout.

3531
03:35:05,979 --> 03:35:06,860
Click on the spout.

3532
03:35:06,860 --> 03:35:07,260
I will.

3533
03:35:07,819 --> 03:35:16,510
I want it to be light out.

3534
03:35:16,510 --> 03:35:18,030
Fill the new coolant.

3535
03:35:18,030 --> 03:35:19,520
I could.

3536
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:32,280
Can I just do the wicked fucked up thing that I think is not funny?

3537
03:35:32,280 --> 03:35:35,639
No one's going to think it's funny, but I will for one second or I'll regret doing it.

3538
03:35:35,639 --> 03:35:36,280
Let's find out.

3539
03:35:39,399 --> 03:35:40,680
Holy shit, those arms.

3540
03:36:12,090 --> 03:36:13,129
I can't see it.

3541
03:36:13,530 --> 03:36:51,200
That's not funny.

3542
03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:53,520
It's not funny at all, actually.

3543
03:36:54,159 --> 03:36:55,840
It's the complete opposite.

3544
03:37:07,719 --> 03:37:17,469
The water is running down my head and I'm drinking it.

3545
03:37:17,469 --> 03:37:18,270
That's enough of that.

3546
03:37:18,829 --> 03:37:19,629
That's enough of that.

3547
03:37:19,629 --> 03:37:20,829
Turn this shit off.

3548
03:37:20,829 --> 03:37:29,950
What else can I do with this?

3549
03:37:29,950 --> 03:37:30,909
Should I wash the car?

3550
03:37:35,709 --> 03:37:37,149
Crouch down and mouse scroll.

3551
03:37:46,909 --> 03:37:48,350
Why is this happening?

3552
03:37:52,170 --> 03:37:53,129
I'm like a gorilla.

3553
03:37:53,690 --> 03:38:13,500
All right.

3554
03:38:13,500 --> 03:38:14,139
That's enough of that.

3555
03:38:14,139 --> 03:38:14,540
Let's go.

3556
03:38:15,100 --> 03:38:15,600
I'm going to.

3557
03:38:22,680 --> 03:38:23,399
This thing was cool.

3558
03:38:24,440 --> 03:38:25,000
Can I climb it?

3559
03:38:25,639 --> 03:38:27,290
Just leave it running.

3560
03:38:27,290 --> 03:38:28,090
You're a monster.

3561
03:38:30,090 --> 03:38:30,889
You're a monster.

3562
03:38:37,799 --> 03:38:39,399
More, more, more.

3563
03:38:39,399 --> 03:38:41,469
The ladder on the other side, is there?

3564
03:38:42,030 --> 03:38:42,750
I'll see a ladder.

3565
03:38:43,309 --> 03:38:52,110
All right.

3566
03:38:52,110 --> 03:38:53,069
Well, that was cool.

3567
03:38:53,069 --> 03:38:55,979
Get out of here.

3568
03:38:55,979 --> 03:39:00,399
You just wasted 200 liters of water on a piss joke.

3569
03:39:00,399 --> 03:39:03,610
That's right.

3570
03:39:03,610 --> 03:39:04,250
I did.

3571
03:39:04,250 --> 03:39:07,709
And I would do it again, too.

3572
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:10,239
You fucking kids.

3573
03:39:10,879 --> 03:39:24,889
Can I drink it out the window?

3574
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:31,239
Wait, can I drink it out the window and piss out this window?

3575
03:39:31,239 --> 03:39:32,200
No, just go.

3576
03:39:32,200 --> 03:39:32,920
Just go.

3577
03:39:32,920 --> 03:39:33,319
Fuck it.

3578
03:39:33,319 --> 03:39:33,879
Who cares?

3579
03:39:34,760 --> 03:39:40,959
All right.

3580
03:39:40,959 --> 03:39:44,399
Now, I drove all the way in the middle of nowhere for this.

3581
03:39:45,040 --> 03:39:46,120
Where do I go now?

3582
03:39:46,680 --> 03:39:50,719
This way?

3583
03:39:51,280 --> 03:40:02,489
Over here?

3584
03:40:04,920 --> 03:40:06,440
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

3585
03:40:06,440 --> 03:40:08,159
Over this way.

3586
03:40:08,879 --> 03:40:09,200
I think.

3587
03:40:19,239 --> 03:40:20,680
Coolint Omega Lull.

3588
03:40:23,709 --> 03:40:24,510
Go back left.

3589
03:40:25,069 --> 03:40:26,860
What the fuck is that?

3590
03:40:26,860 --> 03:40:27,979
Is that another?

3591
03:40:27,979 --> 03:40:29,659
Wait, there's another water tower?

3592
03:40:31,159 --> 03:40:31,799
Oh, shit.

3593
03:40:31,799 --> 03:40:32,520
There's another one.

3594
03:40:33,079 --> 03:40:34,559
And it's a boat.

3595
03:40:35,200 --> 03:41:01,309
Play X-Men Origins Resident Sleeper.

3596
03:41:01,309 --> 03:41:06,409
What are you talking about?

3597
03:41:06,409 --> 03:41:07,049
Same joke.

3598
03:41:07,049 --> 03:41:07,930
No, I'm not stopping.

3599
03:41:08,729 --> 03:41:10,569
Look, I'm just saying that there's one there.

3600
03:41:10,569 --> 03:41:18,159
Too fast.

3601
03:41:18,780 --> 03:41:19,719
Too fast.

3602
03:41:19,719 --> 03:41:20,440
Tree coming.

3603
03:41:21,079 --> 03:41:29,840
I can just dump the...

3604
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:31,040
I can fill everything up again.

3605
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:37,069
Why don't they put X-Men Origins?

3606
03:41:37,709 --> 03:41:39,680
Is that game any good?

3607
03:41:45,870 --> 03:41:46,510
No.

3608
03:41:46,510 --> 03:41:55,739
It's better than the movie.

3609
03:41:57,819 --> 03:41:58,059
All right.

3610
03:41:58,059 --> 03:42:01,899
Look, you only get one weird Xbox 360 request a month.

3611
03:42:02,620 --> 03:42:10,569
This thing is weighing the car down somehow.

3612
03:42:10,569 --> 03:42:17,709
Probably you're in the movies more.

3613
03:42:17,709 --> 03:42:18,989
I probably will eventually.

3614
03:42:19,549 --> 03:42:24,760
All right.

3615
03:42:24,760 --> 03:42:25,399
Let's get some gas.

3616
03:42:26,040 --> 03:42:32,040
Brake.

3617
03:42:32,040 --> 03:42:33,739
Okay.

3618
03:42:33,739 --> 03:42:36,139
How much gas is in this tank?

3619
03:42:36,780 --> 03:42:39,100
Turn off the headlights?

3620
03:42:39,100 --> 03:42:41,120
I'm fine.

3621
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:42,319
Oh, my God.

3622
03:42:42,319 --> 03:42:43,280
We haven't even used...

3623
03:42:43,840 --> 03:42:46,719
We haven't even used two-tenths of a liter.

3624
03:42:46,719 --> 03:42:50,860
I might as well just throw a firework in here.

3625
03:42:50,860 --> 03:42:52,969
I might as well just shoot this.

3626
03:42:56,520 --> 03:42:57,959
What's the point of coming here?

3627
03:42:58,600 --> 03:42:58,920
All right.

3628
03:42:58,920 --> 03:42:59,959
We're going to blow this boat up.

3629
03:43:03,479 --> 03:43:05,239
I'm going to drive by and fire through there.

3630
03:43:05,799 --> 03:43:08,799
I'm going to get a safe distance away.

3631
03:43:09,440 --> 03:43:19,049
You need oil.

3632
03:43:19,049 --> 03:43:23,659
Oh, yeah.

3633
03:43:23,659 --> 03:43:23,979
Yep.

3634
03:43:24,540 --> 03:43:37,760
You can put the new engine in.

3635
03:43:37,760 --> 03:43:41,979
This is going to be such a pog moment.

3636
03:43:41,979 --> 03:43:42,620
I can't wait.

3637
03:43:47,319 --> 03:43:47,959
Wait.

3638
03:43:47,959 --> 03:43:52,000
Why does this engine look way cooler than this engine?

3639
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:53,500
This engine...

3640
03:43:53,500 --> 03:44:02,920
This looks like Bowser's engine, and this is like Koopa's engine.

3641
03:44:02,920 --> 03:44:04,280
It's the same person kind of...

3642
03:44:04,280 --> 03:44:05,239
You know, the turtle.

3643
03:44:05,239 --> 03:44:07,309
New engine.

3644
03:44:07,309 --> 03:44:07,549
All right.

3645
03:44:07,549 --> 03:44:08,190
Let's get oil.

3646
03:44:13,549 --> 03:44:15,819
Oil.

3647
03:44:15,819 --> 03:44:16,379
Gas.

3648
03:44:16,379 --> 03:44:19,129
Nope.

3649
03:44:19,129 --> 03:44:19,530
Gas.

3650
03:44:20,760 --> 03:44:21,319
Alcohol.

3651
03:44:31,870 --> 03:44:32,750
Gas and oil.

3652
03:44:32,750 --> 03:44:34,909
I don't think there's a barrel of oil in it.

3653
03:44:37,440 --> 03:44:38,879
Diesel.

3654
03:44:38,879 --> 03:44:39,440
Oh, shit.

3655
03:44:40,239 --> 03:44:53,100
That's for a big one.

3656
03:44:53,100 --> 03:44:53,500
Nice.

3657
03:44:53,500 --> 03:44:54,139
Good.

3658
03:44:54,139 --> 03:44:58,139
All right.

3659
03:44:58,139 --> 03:45:00,780
Is this engine like a three, four stroke?

3660
03:45:02,540 --> 03:45:03,819
What par is this engine?

3661
03:45:03,819 --> 03:45:04,940
I don't know anything about this shit.

3662
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:15,469
Am I doing this right?

3663
03:45:15,469 --> 03:45:16,270
That's it.

3664
03:45:16,270 --> 03:45:25,639
Sounds good.

3665
03:45:25,639 --> 03:45:26,760
Gap this up.

3666
03:45:26,760 --> 03:45:27,799
Let's get it in there.

3667
03:45:27,799 --> 03:45:37,389
Boom.

3668
03:45:37,389 --> 03:45:38,030
Nice.

3669
03:45:38,030 --> 03:45:42,479
Can I change this coolant tank to a better coolant?

3670
03:45:42,479 --> 03:45:50,670
I have that, right?

3671
03:45:50,670 --> 03:45:51,069
Somewhere.

3672
03:45:51,870 --> 03:45:59,389
All right.

3673
03:45:59,389 --> 03:45:59,790
Wait a minute.

3674
03:45:59,790 --> 03:46:01,930
This one is...

3675
03:46:01,930 --> 03:46:06,649
This is 48% water, 38% oil, 14% alcohol.

3676
03:46:06,649 --> 03:46:08,329
I feel like I'm going to fuck this ratio up.

3677
03:46:08,329 --> 03:46:14,799
Can I bring some oil and alcohol and water over here?

3678
03:46:14,799 --> 03:46:16,430
Dump it.

3679
03:46:16,430 --> 03:46:27,959
Why?

3680
03:46:27,959 --> 03:46:31,370
Just water.

3681
03:46:31,370 --> 03:46:32,409
Oh, okay.

3682
03:46:32,409 --> 03:46:33,209
I got water.

3683
03:46:33,209 --> 03:46:35,950
Let's not use our water though.

3684
03:46:35,950 --> 03:46:38,110
Let's use the house's water.

3685
03:46:38,110 --> 03:46:41,899
Is there water in one of these?

3686
03:46:41,899 --> 03:46:49,760
Pee is not going to work.

3687
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:54,360
R slash water.

3688
03:46:58,879 --> 03:47:00,719
Pee is not going to work.

3689
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:02,639
You're going to ruin this.

3690
03:47:06,239 --> 03:47:07,360
Just pee.

3691
03:47:07,360 --> 03:47:07,680
Okay.

3692
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:10,719
If pee works, I will be very surprised.

3693
03:47:10,719 --> 03:47:40,360
It works.

3694
03:47:40,360 --> 03:47:40,760
Okay.

3695
03:47:40,760 --> 03:48:01,079
Well, I got to drink something.

3696
03:48:01,079 --> 03:48:01,719
Okay.

3697
03:48:01,719 --> 03:48:07,399
Am I not getting it in?

3698
03:48:07,399 --> 03:48:08,120
Why?

3699
03:48:08,120 --> 03:48:17,180
Wait, I'm peeing the oil out?

3700
03:48:17,180 --> 03:48:17,739
I need water.

3701
03:48:21,180 --> 03:48:22,059
Wait, there's water.

3702
03:48:22,059 --> 03:48:22,299
All right.

3703
03:48:22,299 --> 03:48:22,940
Where's the...

3704
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:25,180
Wait, isn't one of these like alcohol, water, and gas?

3705
03:48:27,629 --> 03:48:31,450
My own filtration system.

3706
03:48:31,450 --> 03:48:32,569
One of these is...

3707
03:48:32,569 --> 03:48:33,209
Come on.

3708
03:48:33,209 --> 03:48:33,930
Come on.

3709
03:48:33,930 --> 03:48:34,409
Come on.

3710
03:48:35,129 --> 03:48:36,559
Come on.

3711
03:48:37,280 --> 03:48:38,430
Come on.

3712
03:48:40,559 --> 03:48:42,729
Come on.

3713
03:48:42,729 --> 03:48:43,209
None of these...

3714
03:48:44,399 --> 03:48:46,239
Oh, gas, oil, and diesel.

3715
03:48:46,239 --> 03:48:47,200
No, that's not what I want.

3716
03:48:51,360 --> 03:48:51,920
Empty.

3717
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:52,959
Yeah, of course it is.

3718
03:48:52,959 --> 03:48:53,440
Get out of here.

3719
03:48:55,840 --> 03:48:57,360
Gas, oil, and diesel.

3720
03:48:57,360 --> 03:49:00,159
Get this out of here.

3721
03:49:00,159 --> 03:49:00,879
Oil.

3722
03:49:00,879 --> 03:49:03,920
What's this?

3723
03:49:03,920 --> 03:49:06,430
Look at the water.

3724
03:49:06,430 --> 03:49:07,959
Oil, no?

3725
03:49:07,959 --> 03:49:11,870
Gas, no?

3726
03:49:11,870 --> 03:49:14,110
What's this?

3727
03:49:14,110 --> 03:49:14,430
Empty.

3728
03:49:15,360 --> 03:49:15,760
Empty.

3729
03:49:15,760 --> 03:49:16,079
Fuck it.

3730
03:49:16,079 --> 03:49:17,360
I'm just going to drink the water.

3731
03:49:17,360 --> 03:49:21,469
What about that water tower nearby?

3732
03:49:21,469 --> 03:49:23,950
Yeah, well, I have to go drink and then pee into it.

3733
03:49:23,950 --> 03:49:25,760
I can't...

3734
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:28,000
I mean, I guess we could just go do that.

3735
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:37,719
Let me fill this up.

3736
03:49:37,719 --> 03:49:38,760
I have a water tank in here.

3737
03:49:38,760 --> 03:49:42,459
This one right here.

3738
03:49:42,459 --> 03:49:55,100
Okay.

3739
03:49:55,100 --> 03:49:55,739
Fill it up.

3740
03:49:55,739 --> 03:49:59,000
No, don't drink it.

3741
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:00,200
I want to fill this.

3742
03:50:00,200 --> 03:50:17,840
That's all right for now.

3743
03:50:17,840 --> 03:50:24,350
Water, oil, and alcohol.

3744
03:50:24,350 --> 03:50:25,709
It's going to explode.

3745
03:50:30,200 --> 03:50:30,840
Where?

3746
03:50:30,840 --> 03:50:38,489
If I put this in here, is the car going to turn on?

3747
03:50:38,489 --> 03:50:45,159
Yes or no?

3748
03:50:45,159 --> 03:50:45,719
Yes.

3749
03:50:45,719 --> 03:50:47,790
I hope you're right.

3750
03:50:47,790 --> 03:50:52,569
I hope this engine is good.

3751
03:50:52,569 --> 03:50:52,809
All right.

3752
03:50:52,809 --> 03:50:57,069
We have a new engine and new stuff.

3753
03:50:57,069 --> 03:50:58,430
Oh, listen to that purr.

3754
03:51:00,719 --> 03:51:02,559
Oh, nice.

3755
03:51:02,559 --> 03:51:10,110
Wait, just sleep.

3756
03:51:10,110 --> 03:51:12,280
Turn the car off.

3757
03:51:12,280 --> 03:51:20,520
Turn the car off.

3758
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:21,159
Car off.

3759
03:51:21,159 --> 03:51:25,469
The engine's not even on.

3760
03:51:25,469 --> 03:51:28,719
Okay.

3761
03:51:28,719 --> 03:51:29,200
What?

3762
03:51:29,200 --> 03:51:29,760
Go.

3763
03:51:29,760 --> 03:51:35,680
Still go.

3764
03:51:35,680 --> 03:51:37,360
Don't hit a rock.

3765
03:51:43,290 --> 03:51:43,610
Okay.

3766
03:51:43,610 --> 03:51:43,850
I'm good.

3767
03:51:43,850 --> 03:51:44,090
I'm good.

3768
03:51:44,090 --> 03:51:44,489
I'm good.

3769
03:51:45,450 --> 03:51:50,219
Oh, you know I have to fucking go like 80 miles per hour and sleep, right?

3770
03:51:50,219 --> 03:51:51,500
Like, I have to try.

3771
03:51:52,299 --> 03:52:02,600
Self-driving car.

3772
03:52:04,760 --> 03:52:05,799
Something actually moves now.

3773
03:52:05,799 --> 03:52:05,959
All right.

3774
03:52:05,959 --> 03:52:06,520
Where am I going?

3775
03:52:06,520 --> 03:52:10,079
Where the hell do I need to go?

3776
03:52:10,079 --> 03:52:10,879
The water tower?

3777
03:52:11,840 --> 03:52:12,719
It's so far away.

3778
03:52:12,719 --> 03:52:13,360
No, I don't care.

3779
03:52:13,360 --> 03:52:14,000
I need the road.

3780
03:52:14,719 --> 03:52:22,079
Get out of here.

3781
03:52:22,639 --> 03:52:23,840
Water tower.

3782
03:52:23,840 --> 03:52:24,639
I need the road.

3783
03:52:24,639 --> 03:52:25,120
I don't want any...

3784
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:54,600
Back door.

3785
03:52:54,600 --> 03:52:55,079
Back door.

3786
03:52:55,079 --> 03:52:55,319
I got it.

3787
03:52:55,319 --> 03:52:55,559
I got it.

3788
03:52:55,559 --> 03:52:55,799
I got it.

3789
03:52:55,799 --> 03:52:56,120
I got it.

3790
03:52:56,120 --> 03:52:56,360
I'm good.

3791
03:52:56,360 --> 03:52:56,840
I'm good.

3792
03:52:56,840 --> 03:53:08,440
Something flew out the back.

3793
03:53:11,159 --> 03:53:23,500
Okay.

3794
03:53:23,500 --> 03:53:24,139
Here we are.

3795
03:53:24,139 --> 03:53:37,309
That's coming in fast.

3796
03:53:37,309 --> 03:53:37,709
All right.

3797
03:53:37,709 --> 03:53:42,700
Let's get to the spigot.

3798
03:53:42,700 --> 03:53:43,500
Okay.

3799
03:53:43,500 --> 03:53:51,000
Oh, that's just a crack in the wall.

3800
03:53:51,000 --> 03:53:51,719
Never mind.

3801
03:53:51,719 --> 03:54:30,010
All right.

3802
03:54:30,010 --> 03:54:30,489
Drink.

3803
03:54:30,489 --> 03:54:40,280
Is this death stranding iron?

3804
03:54:40,440 --> 03:55:07,709
I made that joke already.

3805
03:55:07,709 --> 03:55:08,270
Move.

3806
03:55:08,270 --> 03:55:14,649
Close the cap.

3807
03:55:14,649 --> 03:55:17,209
Oh, yeah.

3808
03:55:18,010 --> 03:55:20,409
I probably should close the cap.

3809
03:55:20,409 --> 03:55:29,739
Fill the water tank.

3810
03:55:29,739 --> 03:55:30,059
Yep.

3811
03:55:30,059 --> 03:55:50,159
Come on.

3812
03:55:50,159 --> 03:55:51,870
Fill.

3813
03:55:51,870 --> 03:55:53,229
Fill.

3814
03:55:53,229 --> 03:56:00,250
Fill it.

3815
03:56:00,250 --> 03:56:00,969
Fill it.

3816
03:56:00,969 --> 03:56:06,760
All right.

3817
03:56:06,760 --> 03:56:10,719
Spill.

3818
03:56:10,719 --> 03:56:11,280
Oh, my.

3819
03:56:11,280 --> 03:56:27,760
Good.

3820
03:56:27,760 --> 03:56:48,840
Just fucking fill it.

3821
03:56:48,840 --> 03:56:49,399
We're out.

3822
03:56:49,399 --> 03:56:54,299
This is turning...

3823
03:56:54,299 --> 03:56:56,620
This is a legitimate pee-pee poo-poo stream.

3824
03:56:56,620 --> 03:56:57,340
It is not.

3825
03:56:57,340 --> 03:57:00,559
I'm better than that.

3826
03:57:00,559 --> 03:57:08,409
Come on.

3827
03:57:08,409 --> 03:57:09,049
All right.

3828
03:57:09,049 --> 03:57:10,319
From here.

3829
03:57:10,319 --> 03:57:12,159
Where's the road to keep progressing?

3830
03:57:12,159 --> 03:57:17,979
Is it left or is it right?

3831
03:57:17,979 --> 03:57:19,389
I think it's this way.

3832
03:57:24,090 --> 03:57:25,290
Right here, isn't it?

3833
03:57:25,290 --> 03:57:29,760
Oh, my God.

3834
03:57:29,760 --> 03:57:30,479
Schimpa.

3835
03:57:30,479 --> 03:57:32,959
Schimpa just gave another 20 community subs.

3836
03:57:32,959 --> 03:57:35,180
You are a madman.

3837
03:57:35,739 --> 03:57:37,100
Two, four, six, eight.

3838
03:57:37,100 --> 03:57:39,260
That's 80 community subs from Schimpa.

3839
03:57:39,819 --> 03:57:41,739
Do a monkey noise.

3840
03:57:45,549 --> 03:57:56,620
Look at that shiny hood.

3841
03:57:57,180 --> 03:57:58,329
Good.

3842
03:57:58,329 --> 03:58:04,510
Curious George?

3843
03:58:05,239 --> 03:58:06,360
Curious George didn't talk.

3844
03:58:06,920 --> 03:58:08,989
He didn't make any monkey noises.

3845
03:58:08,989 --> 03:58:10,030
And he just pointed stuff.

3846
03:58:10,670 --> 03:58:15,360
And that guy with a really, really weird fashion sense took care of him.

3847
03:58:16,000 --> 03:58:21,309
The guy that was going to like a Dick Tracy convention every single day.

3848
03:58:22,280 --> 03:58:22,780
Get.

3849
03:58:23,239 --> 03:58:23,739
Oh.

3850
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:24,620
Oh.

3851
03:58:24,840 --> 03:58:25,340
Oh.

3852
03:58:25,479 --> 03:58:25,979
Oh.

3853
03:58:26,360 --> 03:58:26,860
Oh.

3854
03:58:27,799 --> 03:58:28,299
Oh.

3855
03:58:30,059 --> 03:58:30,559
Oh.

3856
03:58:34,680 --> 03:58:35,180
Okay.

3857
03:58:35,479 --> 03:58:41,309
I turned around though this way, right?

3858
03:58:42,239 --> 03:58:42,799
Is that the road?

3859
03:58:44,319 --> 03:58:45,040
There it is.

3860
03:58:45,040 --> 03:58:52,750
You said you were going to blow up the boat.

3861
03:58:53,559 --> 03:58:55,159
Yeah, plans changed though.

3862
03:58:55,159 --> 03:59:01,579
I can't believe I've been playing this game for four hours.

3863
03:59:02,139 --> 03:59:04,590
That's the biggest shock to me.

3864
03:59:04,590 --> 03:59:04,909
Watch out.

3865
03:59:04,909 --> 03:59:05,870
There's rocks incoming.

3866
03:59:08,879 --> 03:59:10,719
I don't know which way the car's going.

3867
03:59:10,719 --> 03:59:11,520
All right.

3868
03:59:11,520 --> 03:59:12,719
That did slow me down a little.

3869
03:59:13,280 --> 03:59:24,250
It's been four hours.

3870
03:59:24,250 --> 03:59:27,069
Yeah, it has a boat.

3871
03:59:27,069 --> 03:59:28,270
No, I don't need any materials.

3872
03:59:28,750 --> 03:59:31,629
I need to find a new gas station with a new awesome car.

3873
03:59:32,350 --> 03:59:35,120
I've been driving this piece of shit around the whole time.

3874
03:59:35,920 --> 03:59:43,399
Wait, what is this?

3875
03:59:43,399 --> 03:59:45,659
This is a little house.

3876
03:59:45,659 --> 03:59:46,219
Ooh, wait a minute.

3877
03:59:46,219 --> 03:59:46,940
This is a little house.

3878
03:59:47,659 --> 03:59:54,459
Is there a car?

3879
03:59:54,459 --> 03:59:55,180
There's a car here.

3880
03:59:55,979 --> 03:59:56,479
Ooh.

3881
03:59:57,260 --> 03:59:58,540
What do you got in there for an engine?

3882
03:59:59,260 --> 04:00:02,799
Oh, shit.

3883
04:00:02,799 --> 04:00:03,920
What is this place?

3884
04:00:03,920 --> 04:00:09,309
Okay, cool.

3885
04:00:09,309 --> 04:00:09,870
What's this thing?

3886
04:00:10,430 --> 04:00:17,280
Okay, is this good?

3887
04:00:18,159 --> 04:00:19,680
No, that's the same engine that I had before.

3888
04:00:20,319 --> 04:00:20,819
Sucks.

3889
04:00:21,280 --> 04:00:26,030
This car is made of clay.

3890
04:00:26,030 --> 04:00:34,750
Pretty good room back here.

3891
04:00:34,750 --> 04:00:38,829
Is it gas?

3892
04:00:39,389 --> 04:00:42,350
No, is it?

3893
04:00:42,350 --> 04:00:42,750
All right.

3894
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:43,469
Is there any gas in it?

3895
04:00:48,399 --> 04:00:50,639
It's a much nicer car, though.

3896
04:00:51,200 --> 04:00:54,399
Steal the dash.

3897
04:00:54,959 --> 04:00:55,440
Oh, shit.

3898
04:00:55,440 --> 04:00:55,840
You're right.

3899
04:00:56,479 --> 04:01:04,079
Shitty engine.

3900
04:01:06,430 --> 04:01:07,930
Back in business.

3901
04:01:07,930 --> 04:01:08,889
Look at that.

3902
04:01:08,889 --> 04:01:09,290
Perfect.

3903
04:01:09,290 --> 04:01:10,649
It's a perfect fit.

3904
04:01:10,649 --> 04:01:20,139
Investigate here.

3905
04:01:20,139 --> 04:01:23,120
Can I open these doors?

3906
04:01:23,120 --> 04:01:33,000
It's in an alien language.

3907
04:01:33,639 --> 04:01:36,239
I can't even get in here?

3908
04:01:36,239 --> 04:01:41,879
I can't put this shit in here.

3909
04:01:41,879 --> 04:01:49,680
How do I get in?

3910
04:01:49,680 --> 04:01:50,799
Oh, boy.

3911
04:01:50,799 --> 04:01:51,360
This is...

3912
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:52,639
This is...

3913
04:01:52,639 --> 04:01:53,200
Oh, yeah.

3914
04:01:56,430 --> 04:01:57,870
A lot of parts in here.

3915
04:01:59,979 --> 04:02:02,399
What do I want to do with these?

3916
04:02:02,399 --> 04:02:03,520
What's this guy?

3917
04:02:03,520 --> 04:02:05,870
What kind of engine is this guy?

3918
04:02:05,870 --> 04:02:07,629
This looks like a pretty cool engine.

3919
04:02:07,629 --> 04:02:09,100
What do you think?

3920
04:02:09,100 --> 04:02:14,750
What's happening?

3921
04:02:14,750 --> 04:02:15,229
Gun.

3922
04:02:15,229 --> 04:02:15,790
Gun.

3923
04:02:15,790 --> 04:02:16,350
Gun.

3924
04:02:16,350 --> 04:02:16,829
Gun.

3925
04:02:16,829 --> 04:02:17,069
Gun.

3926
04:02:17,069 --> 04:02:17,950
What do you mean, gun?

3927
04:02:17,950 --> 04:02:19,520
Is there a gun?

3928
04:02:19,520 --> 04:02:24,319
I already have a gun.

3929
04:02:24,319 --> 04:02:29,500
I already have this.

3930
04:02:29,500 --> 04:02:35,760
I have a gun.

3931
04:02:35,760 --> 04:02:38,879
There's blood in here.

3932
04:02:38,879 --> 04:02:40,159
Why is there blood in here?

3933
04:02:55,260 --> 04:02:56,219
I think I want the blood.

3934
04:02:56,219 --> 04:02:57,020
I'm going to take the...

3935
04:02:57,020 --> 04:02:59,180
Wait, should I dump it out to attract the animals?

3936
04:02:59,180 --> 04:03:03,770
No, fuck this.

3937
04:03:03,770 --> 04:03:04,329
Get this out of here.

3938
04:03:04,329 --> 04:03:05,850
I don't want this thing.

3939
04:03:05,850 --> 04:03:07,370
Disgusting.

3940
04:03:07,370 --> 04:03:08,809
It's a better gun?

3941
04:03:08,809 --> 04:03:13,690
A big tire.

3942
04:03:13,690 --> 04:03:14,540
What's this?

3943
04:03:15,100 --> 04:03:20,350
What's this thing?

3944
04:03:20,350 --> 04:03:25,149
I don't know what any of this stuff does.

3945
04:03:25,149 --> 04:03:30,909
It's a microphone.

3946
04:03:30,909 --> 04:03:34,760
It's a better gun?

3947
04:03:34,760 --> 04:03:35,959
No, it's not a better gun.

3948
04:03:37,209 --> 04:03:38,250
Okay, but what about this engine?

3949
04:03:42,829 --> 04:03:44,280
These engines look...

3950
04:03:44,280 --> 04:03:45,159
I don't know.

3951
04:03:45,159 --> 04:03:46,520
Is one of them better than the other?

3952
04:03:46,520 --> 04:03:47,639
Let's examine them.

3953
04:03:47,639 --> 04:03:57,290
There's a big one over here.

3954
04:04:00,799 --> 04:04:01,520
Another gun.

3955
04:04:02,079 --> 04:04:08,909
The same gun.

3956
04:04:08,909 --> 04:04:13,450
Yeah, it's the same thing.

3957
04:04:13,450 --> 04:04:14,569
Oh, blue paint.

3958
04:04:14,569 --> 04:04:15,290
Yes.

3959
04:04:15,290 --> 04:04:17,000
It was worth coming in here.

3960
04:04:17,000 --> 04:04:20,649
I want to spill this.

3961
04:04:20,649 --> 04:04:39,979
How much paint is in here?

3962
04:04:39,979 --> 04:04:40,700
This is bullshit.

3963
04:04:47,719 --> 04:04:49,559
It's just rusted.

3964
04:04:51,920 --> 04:04:54,760
This car.

3965
04:04:54,760 --> 04:04:57,399
It's got a concrete.

3966
04:04:57,399 --> 04:04:59,000
Why is this car concrete?

3967
04:05:02,159 --> 04:05:03,440
Why am I sleeping?

3968
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:09,479
It's a shotgun.

3969
04:05:16,239 --> 04:05:17,440
No, it's not.

3970
04:05:17,440 --> 04:05:20,559
Where am I?

3971
04:05:20,559 --> 04:05:24,379
What's going on with my body?

3972
04:05:29,469 --> 04:05:30,520
What's going on?

3973
04:05:30,520 --> 04:05:39,850
Why am I behind myself?

3974
04:05:39,850 --> 04:05:40,729
I do.

3975
04:05:40,729 --> 04:05:42,329
Cue?

3976
04:05:42,329 --> 04:05:42,889
Oh, shit.

3977
04:05:42,889 --> 04:05:46,829
Okay, there we go.

3978
04:05:46,829 --> 04:05:48,030
Uh, let's blow this place up.

3979
04:05:48,030 --> 04:05:50,620
Let's push this car over here.

3980
04:05:50,620 --> 04:05:51,180
Fuck this car.

3981
04:05:51,739 --> 04:05:54,489
Fuck the clay car.

3982
04:05:54,489 --> 04:05:55,530
I got a concrete car.

3983
04:05:56,250 --> 04:06:05,129
I'm gonna get very far away.

3984
04:06:05,129 --> 04:06:06,010
Don't worry.

3985
04:06:06,010 --> 04:06:17,799
Oh, shit.

3986
04:06:20,639 --> 04:06:21,120
Sit.

3987
04:06:21,120 --> 04:06:22,239
No, don't sit in there.

3988
04:06:22,239 --> 04:06:32,379
All right, so this isn't a good spot.

3989
04:06:32,379 --> 04:06:33,340
Take this out.

3990
04:06:33,340 --> 04:06:34,540
There's oil right there too.

3991
04:06:34,540 --> 04:06:35,819
This is gonna be a disaster.

3992
04:06:35,819 --> 04:06:37,899
I need to get very far away.

3993
04:06:37,899 --> 04:06:40,350
There it is.

3994
04:06:40,350 --> 04:06:41,469
Perfect angle.

3995
04:06:41,469 --> 04:06:46,809
Let's get in my car and let's fuck off.

3996
04:06:47,610 --> 04:07:02,559
Save the game.

3997
04:07:02,559 --> 04:07:03,200
Yep.

3998
04:07:03,200 --> 04:07:05,600
Good call.

3999
04:07:05,600 --> 04:07:07,440
Okay, this is probably far.

4000
04:07:07,440 --> 04:07:08,479
Is this far enough away?

4001
04:07:08,479 --> 04:07:14,540
I mean, it's not a nuke.

4002
04:07:14,540 --> 04:07:32,809
It's not a nuclear bomb.

4003
04:07:32,809 --> 04:07:33,610
Nice.

4004
04:07:33,610 --> 04:07:36,750
All right, back on the road.

4005
04:07:36,750 --> 04:07:57,500
Sleep in the car.

4006
04:07:58,620 --> 04:08:00,510
Okay.

4007
04:08:01,149 --> 04:08:01,870
Wrong way.

4008
04:08:01,870 --> 04:08:03,309
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

4009
04:08:03,309 --> 04:08:04,989
All right, I'll sleep on the road,

4010
04:08:04,989 --> 04:08:06,350
but I'll make sure the game is saved.

4011
04:08:07,659 --> 04:08:11,979
I'm gonna go like 150 miles per hour and then sleep.

4012
04:08:22,860 --> 04:08:23,360
80.

4013
04:08:25,659 --> 04:08:26,299
Yeah, save it.

4014
04:08:26,299 --> 04:08:27,659
I'm gonna save it right here.

4015
04:08:27,659 --> 04:08:30,020
Is there money on the ground?

4016
04:08:30,020 --> 04:08:30,739
All right, save.

4017
04:08:32,379 --> 04:08:34,219
We're in a perfect spot.

4018
04:08:34,219 --> 04:08:35,020
Back it up.

4019
04:08:35,020 --> 04:08:35,500
Here we go.

4020
04:08:40,690 --> 04:08:42,049
Get this to about 120.

4021
04:08:42,610 --> 04:08:48,399
And then I'm gonna hold V.

4022
04:08:54,739 --> 04:08:55,860
I actually might make it.

4023
04:08:57,229 --> 04:08:58,430
If it's a straight enough straightaway,

4024
04:08:58,430 --> 04:08:59,069
I should be fine.

4025
04:09:00,780 --> 04:09:01,280
We'll see.

4026
04:09:01,840 --> 04:09:07,270
Okay, now is a pretty good time to go to sleep.

4027
04:09:18,049 --> 04:09:19,409
That's efficiency right there.

4028
04:09:28,389 --> 04:09:29,909
Dodge the rock in my sleep.

4029
04:09:43,170 --> 04:09:45,010
It's the DeLorean I time traveled.

4030
04:09:47,829 --> 04:09:48,469
Morty!

4031
04:09:48,469 --> 04:09:49,190
No, it's not Morty.

4032
04:09:49,190 --> 04:09:49,750
It's Marty.

4033
04:09:50,389 --> 04:10:02,559
What's that?

4034
04:10:02,559 --> 04:10:03,540
What was that?

4035
04:10:03,540 --> 04:10:04,100
That was weird.

4036
04:10:04,899 --> 04:10:07,510
That was a weird thing in the road.

4037
04:10:09,670 --> 04:10:11,190
That was a weird thing in the road, wasn't it?

4038
04:10:11,909 --> 04:10:15,649
Nah, who cares?

4039
04:10:15,649 --> 04:10:16,149
Let's go.

4040
04:10:16,770 --> 04:10:18,629
Save it again.

4041
04:10:18,629 --> 04:10:27,600
Sure, not a bad idea.

4042
04:10:27,600 --> 04:10:28,399
Go to the rock.

4043
04:10:28,959 --> 04:10:32,840
How many kilometers have I gone so far, you think?

4044
04:10:33,479 --> 04:10:36,680
I've been on the same tank of gas.

4045
04:10:36,680 --> 04:10:39,079
I have so much gas in the backseat, too.

4046
04:10:39,079 --> 04:10:40,120
There's so much gas.

4047
04:10:40,920 --> 04:10:52,629
I haven't even used a tenth of a liter.

4048
04:11:00,479 --> 04:11:02,079
We only measure in miles.

4049
04:11:02,719 --> 04:11:05,399
Well, that's just what my brain has to do

4050
04:11:05,399 --> 04:11:07,719
because I grew up in the one place on earth.

4051
04:11:08,440 --> 04:11:08,920
They did that.

4052
04:11:10,079 --> 04:11:11,920
Rock in the road, rock in the road, rock in the road.

4053
04:11:11,920 --> 04:11:31,799
Oh, this engine can't even go past 120.

4054
04:11:31,799 --> 04:11:32,840
Come on, we need a better one.

4055
04:11:34,850 --> 04:11:37,170
Somebody said press B and it fucked up everything.

4056
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:39,559
Ban that person.

4057
04:11:39,559 --> 04:11:40,760
The person that just said press B,

4058
04:11:40,760 --> 04:11:42,040
I want them timed out for 30 seconds.

4059
04:11:42,680 --> 04:11:59,639
It's gonna take 30 seconds to find them.

4060
04:11:59,639 --> 04:12:01,479
All right, we'll just pretend they got timed out.

4061
04:12:01,479 --> 04:12:06,399
I have to investigate this because it could be a truck.

4062
04:12:06,959 --> 04:12:14,000
If there's a bus or anything, it's possible.

4063
04:12:17,409 --> 04:12:17,649
No.

4064
04:12:18,520 --> 04:12:20,760
Sad, sad, sad, sad, sad.

4065
04:12:21,479 --> 04:12:22,799
What is it?

4066
04:12:22,799 --> 04:12:23,299
Sadja?

4067
04:12:24,000 --> 04:12:25,190
It's a J?

4068
04:12:26,129 --> 04:12:26,629
Sage?

4069
04:12:27,170 --> 04:12:27,729
How do you say it?

4070
04:12:42,129 --> 04:12:44,049
This is an interesting little spot right here.

4071
04:12:44,049 --> 04:12:44,610
Anything here?

4072
04:12:46,280 --> 04:12:47,399
Rolling up like this.

4073
04:12:47,399 --> 04:12:48,280
All right, what do you got?

4074
04:12:50,680 --> 04:12:51,180
Bumpa?

4075
04:12:52,600 --> 04:12:57,879
What do you got?

4076
04:12:57,879 --> 04:12:59,299
What's in there?

4077
04:12:59,299 --> 04:13:00,100
Gas?

4078
04:13:00,100 --> 04:13:01,059
Just use it.

4079
04:13:01,059 --> 04:13:11,520
Blood, put blood in the tank.

4080
04:13:17,399 --> 04:13:17,879
Oh, yeah.

4081
04:13:18,610 --> 04:13:19,430
Yep.

4082
04:13:19,430 --> 04:13:20,389
Thank God.

4083
04:13:20,389 --> 04:13:26,799
I can actually wash the car now.

4084
04:13:26,799 --> 04:13:27,360
What gold?

4085
04:13:27,360 --> 04:13:28,000
I don't even want it.

4086
04:13:28,000 --> 04:13:29,200
This is stupid.

4087
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:30,399
Here's the thing I was talking about.

4088
04:13:33,459 --> 04:13:34,500
What is this?

4089
04:13:34,500 --> 04:13:40,389
There's a secret engine in here.

4090
04:13:40,389 --> 04:13:41,270
How do I get it?

4091
04:13:41,270 --> 04:13:45,120
There's an engine in there.

4092
04:13:45,120 --> 04:14:21,270
I'll get out.

4093
04:14:21,270 --> 04:14:25,489
Check this shit out.

4094
04:14:25,489 --> 04:14:39,379
Was it the last save?

4095
04:14:39,379 --> 04:14:41,270
I don't know.

4096
04:14:41,270 --> 04:14:42,389
I don't remember what it is.

4097
04:14:42,389 --> 04:14:43,190
This one here?

4098
04:14:43,190 --> 04:14:44,979
No, it was after.

4099
04:14:44,979 --> 04:14:45,620
Where is it?

4100
04:14:45,620 --> 04:14:47,780
Oh, it's right here.

4101
04:14:47,780 --> 04:14:48,659
Look at the auto save.

4102
04:14:48,659 --> 04:15:04,399
God damn it, I had it.

4103
04:15:04,399 --> 04:15:12,209
I think you can fucking trap me in there.

4104
04:15:12,209 --> 04:15:12,690
Don't think so.

4105
04:15:12,690 --> 04:15:13,190
Give me that.

4106
04:15:26,930 --> 04:15:28,450
Polishing concrete.

4107
04:15:28,450 --> 04:15:29,809
Looks pretty good.

4108
04:15:29,809 --> 04:15:30,770
Do you know what you think?

4109
04:15:30,770 --> 04:16:13,059
Better than ever, I think.

4110
04:16:13,059 --> 04:16:14,340
Wash the concrete away.

4111
04:16:14,340 --> 04:16:15,379
That's not how that works.

4112
04:16:15,379 --> 04:16:33,780
Too bright.

4113
04:16:33,780 --> 04:16:34,579
It was working?

4114
04:16:35,139 --> 04:16:36,319
It was working.

4115
04:16:39,840 --> 04:16:41,440
I can't go back for a sponge.

4116
04:16:41,440 --> 04:16:43,040
I've yaded it into the sun.

4117
04:16:43,760 --> 04:16:46,559
There'll be more sponges.

4118
04:16:47,200 --> 04:17:00,079
No, there won't be.

4119
04:17:00,079 --> 04:17:01,280
Yes, there will.

4120
04:17:01,280 --> 04:17:02,479
That's like sponge number 10

4121
04:17:02,479 --> 04:17:03,520
we've found in the game so far.

4122
04:17:03,520 --> 04:17:04,159
We're going to be fine.

4123
04:17:04,719 --> 04:17:15,540
I'm going to lose control if I don't stop.

4124
04:17:16,100 --> 04:17:19,540
No telephone pole.

4125
04:17:19,540 --> 04:17:20,100
No telephone pole.

4126
04:17:20,100 --> 04:17:20,659
No telephone pole.

4127
04:17:20,659 --> 04:17:21,059
We're fine.

4128
04:17:24,079 --> 04:17:24,579
No!

4129
04:17:25,440 --> 04:17:30,680
Back on the road.

4130
04:17:30,680 --> 04:17:36,420
Every sponge is personalized.

4131
04:17:41,010 --> 04:17:42,770
Oh, pretty good tuber voice.

4132
04:17:42,770 --> 04:17:49,239
I had to do it.

4133
04:17:54,979 --> 04:17:56,180
Not that there's a lot of people here.

4134
04:17:56,979 --> 04:17:58,579
I do want to make sure I let you know.

4135
04:17:59,299 --> 04:18:00,040
Tomorrow.

4136
04:18:00,680 --> 04:18:01,959
I'm not streaming tomorrow.

4137
04:18:02,600 --> 04:18:04,559
I'll be on Kitboga's stream.

4138
04:18:05,360 --> 04:18:07,190
Popping in from time to time as a guest

4139
04:18:07,190 --> 04:18:08,629
when he finds a good call.

4140
04:18:09,350 --> 04:18:13,680
I already said press B.

4141
04:18:13,680 --> 04:18:14,159
I just did.

4142
04:18:14,879 --> 04:18:16,000
I'm going to host it.

4143
04:18:16,559 --> 04:18:18,000
The stream will just be hosted the whole time.

4144
04:18:18,799 --> 04:18:20,500
Maybe I'll pop in a little bit.

4145
04:18:20,500 --> 04:18:22,260
Maybe we'll get a fun call going.

4146
04:18:22,979 --> 04:18:25,620
That's the plan.

4147
04:18:25,620 --> 04:18:27,540
I won't be live tomorrow on this channel.

4148
04:18:32,450 --> 04:18:33,889
I have to have gone pretty far, right?

4149
04:18:34,450 --> 04:18:40,850
What time is that stream at?

4150
04:18:42,049 --> 04:18:42,930
That's a really good question

4151
04:18:42,930 --> 04:18:44,850
because I know Kit starts streaming

4152
04:18:46,420 --> 04:18:49,299
around 10, 9, 10 a.m. Pacific.

4153
04:18:50,340 --> 04:18:52,420
Somewhere around maybe noon Eastern.

4154
04:18:52,420 --> 04:18:53,459
That's where he typically starts.

4155
04:18:55,590 --> 04:18:58,309
I'm going to assume somewhere around

4156
04:18:59,270 --> 04:19:04,479
10 to 12 Pacific is when I'll be on.

4157
04:19:05,120 --> 04:19:05,440
Maybe.

4158
04:19:06,239 --> 04:19:09,780
Maybe a little later.

4159
04:19:09,780 --> 04:19:11,219
Maybe a little earlier depending on

4160
04:19:11,219 --> 04:19:12,819
if he gets a call that he likes.

4161
04:19:12,819 --> 04:19:13,299
That's good.

4162
04:19:13,940 --> 04:19:23,360
This has been pretty clean so far at 130 plus.

4163
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:25,840
140 now.

4164
04:19:26,399 --> 04:19:27,889
This is it.

4165
04:19:27,889 --> 04:19:28,290
It's over.

4166
04:19:28,290 --> 04:19:28,610
It's over.

4167
04:19:28,610 --> 04:19:28,930
It's over.

4168
04:19:28,930 --> 04:19:29,250
No, it's not.

4169
04:19:29,250 --> 04:19:30,770
Just calm down and go through the gap.

4170
04:19:30,770 --> 04:19:31,250
Okay, we're good.

4171
04:19:31,889 --> 04:19:35,829
Just let the car ride a little.

4172
04:19:35,829 --> 04:19:36,549
Let the car ride.

4173
04:19:36,549 --> 04:19:38,229
Break, break, break, break, break, break.

4174
04:19:38,229 --> 04:19:38,950
You're good.

4175
04:19:38,950 --> 04:19:40,069
Watch out for that tiny rock.

4176
04:19:40,870 --> 04:19:43,639
What happened?

4177
04:19:43,639 --> 04:19:45,079
Why did the oil come out?

4178
04:19:45,969 --> 04:19:46,530
I need that.

4179
04:19:48,370 --> 04:19:48,850
What happened?

4180
04:19:48,850 --> 04:19:49,729
Let's assess the damage.

4181
04:19:49,729 --> 04:19:50,530
Hold on.

4182
04:19:50,530 --> 04:19:56,229
How did I get out of there?

4183
04:19:56,229 --> 04:20:07,889
It slipped through the tire.

4184
04:20:07,889 --> 04:20:09,170
Did I lose a tire?

4185
04:20:09,170 --> 04:20:10,559
Hold on.

4186
04:20:10,559 --> 04:20:11,360
I lost a tire.

4187
04:20:11,920 --> 04:20:16,000
I think I did.

4188
04:20:16,639 --> 04:20:28,739
No, I didn't lose it.

4189
04:20:28,739 --> 04:20:29,780
Why is there a tire out here?

4190
04:20:30,500 --> 04:20:37,139
Oh, that's the spare.

4191
04:20:37,139 --> 04:20:38,020
Why does it look like shit?

4192
04:20:38,500 --> 04:20:40,000
All right, we need to.

4193
04:20:40,000 --> 04:20:41,040
I got to recalibrate this.

4194
04:20:41,040 --> 04:20:41,840
Hold on.

4195
04:20:41,840 --> 04:20:44,899
Right over a fucking stone.

4196
04:20:45,700 --> 04:20:47,059
All right, get in there.

4197
04:20:49,190 --> 04:20:50,229
Long ways, please.

4198
04:20:50,870 --> 04:20:51,510
Long ways.

4199
04:20:58,690 --> 04:20:58,930
Why?

4200
04:20:58,930 --> 04:20:59,889
Won't fit anymore?

4201
04:21:01,780 --> 04:21:02,579
Thank you.

4202
04:21:02,579 --> 04:21:09,959
You don't need the barrel?

4203
04:21:09,959 --> 04:21:11,399
I have to take the barrel.

4204
04:21:11,399 --> 04:21:13,200
The only way I feel comfortable.

4205
04:21:14,260 --> 04:21:14,979
Fuck the spare.

4206
04:21:14,979 --> 04:21:15,299
Just get it.

4207
04:21:15,299 --> 04:21:16,180
I don't even care.

4208
04:21:16,180 --> 04:21:16,979
I don't care.

4209
04:21:16,979 --> 04:21:20,629
Get me the fuck out of here.

4210
04:21:30,840 --> 04:21:31,799
Safety barrel.

4211
04:21:32,360 --> 04:21:42,879
My, like, gamer growth hurts so much.

4212
04:21:43,520 --> 04:21:55,479
Oh, there's a bunch of people that might not have been here.

4213
04:21:59,079 --> 04:21:59,799
You had to be there.

4214
04:21:59,799 --> 04:22:00,600
That's all I can say.

4215
04:22:00,600 --> 04:22:02,040
And really, that's really all I'm going to say.

4216
04:22:02,840 --> 04:22:07,620
Oh, shit.

4217
04:22:07,620 --> 04:22:08,579
I'm going 140.

4218
04:22:09,219 --> 04:22:11,079
Oh, my God.

4219
04:22:11,079 --> 04:22:12,200
I'm going 140.

4220
04:22:12,200 --> 04:22:12,920
Oh, my God.

4221
04:22:12,920 --> 04:22:13,719
Oh, my God.

4222
04:22:13,719 --> 04:22:14,600
Oh, my God.

4223
04:22:14,600 --> 04:22:15,159
Oh, my God.

4224
04:22:15,159 --> 04:22:15,639
It's okay.

4225
04:22:17,879 --> 04:22:18,840
But don't touch anything.

4226
04:22:21,120 --> 04:22:22,079
I just missed it.

4227
04:22:23,700 --> 04:22:24,819
I just missed it.

4228
04:22:24,819 --> 04:22:25,379
Break.

4229
04:22:25,379 --> 04:22:25,860
Let's go.

4230
04:22:33,940 --> 04:22:34,420
But no.

4231
04:22:34,979 --> 04:22:36,180
Here's the surprising thing.

4232
04:22:36,180 --> 04:22:38,579
No new gas station.

4233
04:22:39,139 --> 04:22:41,989
You guys remember when I actually thought

4234
04:22:41,989 --> 04:22:43,590
that I was going to be able to fucking walk?

4235
04:22:45,079 --> 04:22:47,399
Thank God I actually restarted.

4236
04:22:47,399 --> 04:22:49,319
I would still be walking to that gas station.

4237
04:22:55,750 --> 04:22:58,629
And there would be, like, 1,100 people still here.

4238
04:23:01,569 --> 04:23:02,129
Thank God.

4239
04:23:02,690 --> 04:23:15,879
Why did that happen?

4240
04:23:24,159 --> 04:23:25,200
It just clipped.

4241
04:23:25,200 --> 04:23:26,079
I just clipped it.

4242
04:23:26,719 --> 04:23:30,790
It just got clipped a little.

4243
04:23:31,510 --> 04:23:32,389
I lost something.

4244
04:23:33,030 --> 04:23:34,629
What did I lose?

4245
04:23:35,430 --> 04:23:39,200
Something fell off.

4246
04:23:39,840 --> 04:23:42,579
I didn't lose anything.

4247
04:23:43,219 --> 04:23:44,600
Everything looks...

4248
04:23:44,600 --> 04:23:45,079
Wait.

4249
04:23:45,079 --> 04:23:46,200
Everything seems to be in order.

4250
04:23:46,760 --> 04:23:54,610
No, I didn't lose anything.

4251
04:23:54,610 --> 04:23:58,870
I took out my gold bar.

4252
04:23:58,870 --> 04:24:07,250
I lost a hubcap.

4253
04:24:07,250 --> 04:24:07,809
That's okay.

4254
04:24:08,530 --> 04:24:10,370
All right.

4255
04:24:10,370 --> 04:24:12,049
Slow down because the sun is unbearable.

4256
04:24:17,680 --> 04:24:20,420
Stop driving.

4257
04:24:20,420 --> 04:24:21,459
You're losing gas.

4258
04:24:23,719 --> 04:24:25,239
Yes, I am.

4259
04:24:25,879 --> 04:24:29,430
That's a big building coming up.

4260
04:24:29,430 --> 04:24:29,909
Finally.

4261
04:24:30,709 --> 04:24:33,360
Slow down.

4262
04:24:33,360 --> 04:24:34,319
I can't see shit.

4263
04:24:34,879 --> 04:24:38,309
I'd rather hit something going 30 than hit something going 80.

4264
04:24:38,950 --> 04:24:42,149
Just the thing you pull down.

4265
04:24:42,149 --> 04:24:42,709
Oh, right.

4266
04:24:42,709 --> 04:24:43,590
I threw it out the window.

4267
04:24:45,250 --> 04:24:46,209
That's a big building.

4268
04:24:57,110 --> 04:24:59,270
I'm doing the Ace Ventura Jim Carrey thing.

4269
04:25:09,459 --> 04:25:10,340
Loud as hell.

4270
04:25:10,979 --> 04:25:15,239
Look at that big house.

4271
04:25:15,879 --> 04:25:43,569
Am I okay?

4272
04:25:44,129 --> 04:25:50,000
I'm fine.

4273
04:25:50,000 --> 04:25:52,340
The car is fine.

4274
04:25:52,340 --> 04:25:52,739
Cool.

4275
04:25:52,739 --> 04:25:53,139
All right.

4276
04:25:53,139 --> 04:25:53,459
Nice.

4277
04:25:53,459 --> 04:26:03,329
Look at this big ass house.

4278
04:26:03,329 --> 04:26:03,889
Yes.

4279
04:26:03,889 --> 04:26:04,530
A bike.

4280
04:26:04,530 --> 04:26:07,489
I don't know how to work it.

4281
04:26:07,489 --> 04:26:10,799
Fuel tank.

4282
04:26:10,799 --> 04:26:11,600
Empty.

4283
04:26:11,600 --> 04:26:12,159
Gas.

4284
04:26:12,159 --> 04:26:13,799
All right.

4285
04:26:13,799 --> 04:26:14,760
Pick this shit up.

4286
04:26:14,840 --> 04:26:15,959
I want to get this to work.

4287
04:26:15,959 --> 04:26:17,799
I'm going to ride a goddamn bike.

4288
04:26:17,799 --> 04:26:26,260
No, please don't.

4289
04:26:26,260 --> 04:26:26,979
What do you mean?

4290
04:26:26,979 --> 04:26:28,790
No wheels.

4291
04:26:28,790 --> 04:26:29,110
No.

4292
04:26:29,110 --> 04:26:29,829
I can get wheels.

4293
04:26:29,829 --> 04:26:31,030
I have plenty of wheels.

4294
04:26:31,030 --> 04:26:45,590
Why can I not fill this?

4295
04:26:45,590 --> 04:26:47,350
How much gas does it need?

4296
04:26:47,350 --> 04:26:48,389
What's the combo?

4297
04:26:48,389 --> 04:27:00,520
Get gun.

4298
04:27:00,520 --> 04:27:01,000
Get new.

4299
04:27:01,719 --> 04:27:02,680
That's a new gun.

4300
04:27:02,680 --> 04:27:04,020
Not a new gun.

4301
04:27:04,020 --> 04:27:28,579
Sink.

4302
04:27:28,579 --> 04:27:33,139
What actually is this?

4303
04:27:33,139 --> 04:27:37,059
It's a trailer.

4304
04:27:38,479 --> 04:27:41,000
Holy shit.

4305
04:27:41,000 --> 04:27:41,799
It's a trailer.

4306
04:27:41,799 --> 04:27:44,079
Can I use it?

4307
04:27:44,079 --> 04:27:48,440
I hope I can actually attach this thing.

4308
04:27:48,440 --> 04:27:50,079
Put the bed in here.

4309
04:27:50,079 --> 04:27:52,899
Oh my god.

4310
04:27:52,899 --> 04:27:53,459
Yeah.

4311
04:27:53,459 --> 04:27:55,620
There are no wheels on it, but it's okay.

4312
04:27:55,620 --> 04:27:56,899
I think I can still probably attach it.

4313
04:28:01,559 --> 04:28:11,459
Stay right there.

4314
04:28:11,459 --> 04:28:12,100
It is that.

4315
04:28:12,100 --> 04:28:13,459
And then here, right?

4316
04:28:13,459 --> 04:28:19,059
I can't pick it up.

4317
04:28:19,059 --> 04:28:20,870
I can just push it.

4318
04:28:20,870 --> 04:28:21,670
Other way.

4319
04:28:21,670 --> 04:28:28,229
Other way.

4320
04:28:28,229 --> 04:28:28,549
Damn it.

4321
04:28:28,549 --> 04:28:30,069
I thought that was going to be awesome.

4322
04:28:30,069 --> 04:28:47,780
We're going to attach?

4323
04:28:47,780 --> 04:28:48,819
Make a train.

4324
04:28:48,819 --> 04:28:52,120
I don't think I can attach this.

4325
04:28:52,120 --> 04:28:55,700
Press F to hold it.

4326
04:28:55,700 --> 04:29:01,440
Well, F. Grab the end of it.

4327
04:29:01,440 --> 04:29:03,440
Oh, yeah.

4328
04:29:03,440 --> 04:29:03,760
Yes.

4329
04:29:04,319 --> 04:29:05,219
Yes.

4330
04:29:05,219 --> 04:29:05,540
Yes.

4331
04:29:06,180 --> 04:29:06,500
Yes.

4332
04:29:07,139 --> 04:29:07,459
Yes.

4333
04:29:08,520 --> 04:29:08,840
Yes.

4334
04:29:10,600 --> 04:29:11,319
Yes.

4335
04:29:11,319 --> 04:29:12,600
And I can bring this.

4336
04:29:12,600 --> 04:29:13,399
I can bring the bike.

4337
04:29:13,399 --> 04:29:14,440
I can actually carry it.

4338
04:29:14,440 --> 04:29:16,600
What's happening?

4339
04:29:16,600 --> 04:29:17,159
Stop.

4340
04:29:17,159 --> 04:29:25,760
I'm going to bring this bike wherever I want.

4341
04:29:26,159 --> 04:29:31,459
I'm going to find wheels for it.

4342
04:29:31,459 --> 04:29:32,100
Excellent.

4343
04:29:32,100 --> 04:29:33,510
And the bed?

4344
04:29:33,510 --> 04:29:37,750
I don't think the bed's not going to fit on there.

4345
04:29:37,750 --> 04:29:40,440
This thing is too big.

4346
04:29:40,440 --> 04:29:45,239
What's wrong with me?

4347
04:29:45,239 --> 04:29:50,020
Why am I hearing bells?

4348
04:29:50,020 --> 04:29:55,010
I died?

4349
04:29:55,010 --> 04:30:03,299
What does it say?

4350
04:30:03,299 --> 04:30:08,530
Here?

4351
04:30:08,530 --> 04:30:10,850
Bed killed me.

4352
04:30:10,850 --> 04:30:11,409
Wait, did I?

4353
04:30:11,409 --> 04:30:11,649
Okay.

4354
04:30:21,670 --> 04:30:22,389
Shit.

4355
04:30:22,389 --> 04:30:28,579
All right.

4356
04:30:28,579 --> 04:30:29,219
Bike.

4357
04:30:29,219 --> 04:30:33,540
So are you sure I didn't die from dehydration?

4358
04:30:33,540 --> 04:30:38,659
That's not what happened, right?

4359
04:30:38,659 --> 04:30:44,209
Cap the thing.

4360
04:30:44,209 --> 04:30:48,340
Cap the thing.

4361
04:30:48,340 --> 04:30:49,700
Well, I can't bring the bed then.

4362
04:30:49,700 --> 04:30:55,219
I'm sorry.

4363
04:30:55,219 --> 04:30:55,780
I can't.

4364
04:30:55,780 --> 04:30:57,799
I want to, but I can't.

4365
04:30:57,799 --> 04:31:01,239
Go upstairs.

4366
04:31:01,239 --> 04:31:02,920
I know I'm not done exploring.

4367
04:31:02,920 --> 04:31:07,879
How do I get upstairs, though?

4368
04:31:07,879 --> 04:31:08,680
Is there a ladder?

4369
04:31:08,680 --> 04:31:14,600
Can I climb that?

4370
04:31:14,600 --> 04:31:21,600
Big money?

4371
04:31:21,600 --> 04:31:23,360
Oh, there was a lot of big money.

4372
04:31:23,360 --> 04:31:25,219
Yeah, let's take another pee break.

4373
04:31:25,219 --> 04:31:26,579
And I'm going to, when I come back, I'm going to do,

4374
04:31:26,579 --> 04:31:27,620
I'm going to go over some of these bits.

4375
04:31:27,620 --> 04:31:29,299
There's been like a bunch of huge ones.

4376
04:31:29,299 --> 04:31:30,719
I'll be right back.

4377
04:31:30,719 --> 04:34:09,360
Holy shit, guys.

4378
04:34:09,360 --> 04:34:13,439
I just realized I haven't brushed my teeth in like eight or nine days.

4379
04:34:13,439 --> 04:34:14,319
They're green.

4380
04:34:14,319 --> 04:34:17,189
Should I just take a minute to brush them or whatever?

4381
04:34:17,189 --> 04:34:25,799
I don't know why I thought that was like, well, that's like a funny thing I'll say.

4382
04:34:25,799 --> 04:34:26,520
Like, that's not even funny.

4383
04:34:26,520 --> 04:34:27,799
This is gross and strange.

4384
04:34:27,799 --> 04:34:29,000
You're just a weird guy.

4385
04:34:29,000 --> 04:34:30,200
It's disgusting everybody.

4386
04:34:30,200 --> 04:34:32,119
That's not like, oh, funny, huh?

4387
04:34:32,119 --> 04:34:33,159
No, it's just gross.

4388
04:34:35,990 --> 04:34:40,880
All right, we're back to the long road.

4389
04:34:40,880 --> 04:34:45,110
What was I trying to do?

4390
04:34:45,110 --> 04:34:45,590
Get on the roof?

4391
04:34:46,229 --> 04:34:54,159
I don't think I can.

4392
04:34:54,880 --> 04:34:57,750
Can't climb pipes.

4393
04:35:00,319 --> 04:35:03,599
I brushed him like, I brushed him right before the stream turned on,

4394
04:35:03,599 --> 04:35:04,479
like five hours ago.

4395
04:35:04,479 --> 04:35:04,880
I'm fine.

4396
04:35:04,880 --> 04:35:05,279
I'm kidding.

4397
04:35:05,279 --> 04:35:05,840
It was a joke.

4398
04:35:06,479 --> 04:35:25,509
Oh, I need this right in the back.

4399
04:35:25,509 --> 04:35:26,549
Kind of violent, but whatever.

4400
04:35:29,110 --> 04:35:29,990
I got plenty of gas.

4401
04:35:29,990 --> 04:35:30,630
I got my bike.

4402
04:35:30,630 --> 04:35:34,229
I have my trailer, but I don't, I can't, I don't think I can get up there.

4403
04:35:34,869 --> 04:35:36,790
Throw your teeth.

4404
04:35:36,790 --> 04:35:39,189
No, that's too, that's way too intimate.

4405
04:35:39,590 --> 04:35:41,569
Don't jump in there, stupid.

4406
04:35:42,369 --> 04:35:45,000
That's too like, I mean, personal.

4407
04:35:45,720 --> 04:35:47,619
Oh, the bits, right, right, right, yeah, yeah, sorry.

4408
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:50,630
Attack of the Hank gave five community subs.

4409
04:35:50,630 --> 04:35:51,029
Thanks.

4410
04:35:51,029 --> 04:35:53,590
Board of Bones gave $50.

4411
04:35:53,590 --> 04:35:56,020
5,000 bits from Board of Bones.

4412
04:35:56,020 --> 04:35:58,180
I've been watching your videos for about seven years.

4413
04:35:58,180 --> 04:36:00,659
I want to give a huge thanks to all the entertainment throughout the years.

4414
04:36:00,659 --> 04:36:02,069
You're the best.

4415
04:36:02,069 --> 04:36:03,700
That's a long time.

4416
04:36:03,700 --> 04:36:06,360
Hope you stick around for season eight.

4417
04:36:07,560 --> 04:36:09,400
That's the season that everybody says to skip.

4418
04:36:09,400 --> 04:36:12,599
And then we had Lorag for $50.

4419
04:36:12,599 --> 04:36:13,639
Hey man, long time no see.

4420
04:36:13,639 --> 04:36:15,639
You've left a couple dozen voice bails.

4421
04:36:15,720 --> 04:36:17,729
But I guess they haven't been getting to you for some reason.

4422
04:36:17,729 --> 04:36:18,529
Ha ha.

4423
04:36:18,529 --> 04:36:20,369
Anyways, I just wanted to check up on you and chat.

4424
04:36:20,369 --> 04:36:22,950
Hope you're all doing as well as you can.

4425
04:36:22,950 --> 04:36:24,470
Except for Keith, he sucks.

4426
04:36:24,470 --> 04:36:25,430
Sorry, Keith.

4427
04:36:25,430 --> 04:36:28,520
Thank you, Lorag, for the 5,000 bits.

4428
04:36:28,520 --> 04:36:30,040
Potion Dweller, 5,000 bits.

4429
04:36:30,040 --> 04:36:31,000
Belated happy birthday.

4430
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:33,169
Just celebrated my yesterday.

4431
04:36:33,169 --> 04:36:37,000
Question, have you considered doing any D&D streams with Stir and Arcadium?

4432
04:36:37,000 --> 04:36:38,599
I think you'd be magnificent on them.

4433
04:36:38,599 --> 04:36:40,950
I know your schedule tends to be a little crazy,

4434
04:36:40,950 --> 04:36:43,189
but you should give it a go if you can work the time up.

4435
04:36:43,189 --> 04:36:45,349
Well, I have something to tell you.

4436
04:36:45,430 --> 04:36:52,529
Star is working on a custom sorcery-style D&D-like campaign

4437
04:36:52,529 --> 04:36:55,990
that I'm going to be playing on stream.

4438
04:36:55,990 --> 04:36:57,830
He's in the middle of doing it right now.

4439
04:36:57,830 --> 04:37:02,529
It's going to be a choose-your-own-adventure game board.

4440
04:37:02,529 --> 04:37:06,049
Custom made.

4441
04:37:06,049 --> 04:37:06,930
I'm really looking forward to it.

4442
04:37:06,930 --> 04:37:07,650
It should be good.

4443
04:37:07,650 --> 04:37:10,200
I don't have a timetable on when it's going to be done

4444
04:37:10,200 --> 04:37:13,540
because he's just going to do it.

4445
04:37:13,540 --> 04:37:16,369
There's no like, oh, that'll be next week.

4446
04:37:16,369 --> 04:37:18,529
But maybe by the end of the year, early next year,

4447
04:37:18,529 --> 04:37:21,729
whenever he gets around to making it and doing it,

4448
04:37:21,729 --> 04:37:23,680
there's no rush on it.

4449
04:37:23,680 --> 04:37:25,759
So whenever it's ready, it should be a lot of fun.

4450
04:37:25,759 --> 04:37:29,490
Thanks a lot, guys, though.

4451
04:37:29,490 --> 04:37:34,520
Let's keep going.

4452
04:37:34,520 --> 04:37:35,400
Show those teeth.

4453
04:37:35,400 --> 04:37:36,599
No, I don't want to show you my teeth.

4454
04:37:37,240 --> 04:37:41,970
There's only two people in the world that are going to see my teeth.

4455
04:37:44,130 --> 04:37:48,759
The dentist and me.

4456
04:37:48,759 --> 04:37:51,159
And I hate the dentist.

4457
04:37:51,159 --> 04:37:52,919
Not because I don't like going to the dentist.

4458
04:37:52,919 --> 04:37:54,229
I don't care.

4459
04:37:54,229 --> 04:37:58,069
I don't like when they open your mouth really wide

4460
04:37:58,069 --> 04:37:59,750
and they take a look at every single inch

4461
04:37:59,750 --> 04:38:01,889
and they can see everything.

4462
04:38:01,889 --> 04:38:03,330
You can't hide shit from the dentist.

4463
04:38:05,029 --> 04:38:06,229
And you think that you're so clever

4464
04:38:06,229 --> 04:38:09,990
by brushing your teeth and flossing 20 minutes before you go.

4465
04:38:09,990 --> 04:38:11,590
Look, aren't they clean?

4466
04:38:11,590 --> 04:38:12,310
No, they're not.

4467
04:38:12,310 --> 04:38:12,630
They're not.

4468
04:38:12,630 --> 04:38:13,270
Not at all.

4469
04:38:13,270 --> 04:38:14,150
That doesn't do anything.

4470
04:38:14,150 --> 04:38:16,849
You think it does, but it doesn't.

4471
04:38:16,849 --> 04:38:19,569
I haven't flossed in four and a half months.

4472
04:38:19,569 --> 04:38:20,930
But look, I flossed.

4473
04:38:20,930 --> 04:38:22,450
No, there's this buildup back there.

4474
04:38:22,450 --> 04:38:23,409
They know what you're doing.

4475
04:38:23,409 --> 04:38:24,209
You're an asshole.

4476
04:38:24,770 --> 04:38:27,250
All right, how do I get up?

4477
04:38:27,250 --> 04:38:32,639
I don't think I can't get up on the roof.

4478
04:38:32,639 --> 04:38:33,520
I can't.

4479
04:38:33,520 --> 04:38:37,639
Why are you such a tool?

4480
04:38:39,990 --> 04:38:40,549
What?

4481
04:38:40,549 --> 04:38:42,919
What do you mean?

4482
04:38:45,970 --> 04:38:47,409
That kind of made me feel bad.

4483
04:38:47,970 --> 04:38:50,549
I'm sorry, dude.

4484
04:38:50,549 --> 04:38:55,479
Anyways.

4485
04:39:00,400 --> 04:39:01,520
Yeah, that kind of just like, I don't know.

4486
04:39:01,520 --> 04:39:04,360
That like really, they really just like threw me off.

4487
04:39:04,360 --> 04:39:04,599
Yeah.

4488
04:39:04,599 --> 04:39:04,919
All right.

4489
04:39:04,919 --> 04:39:06,040
Well, I'll see you guys later.

4490
04:39:06,040 --> 04:39:06,599
That's, I don't know.

4491
04:39:06,599 --> 04:39:07,319
It's like fucking with me.

4492
04:39:07,319 --> 04:39:07,880
You know what I mean?

4493
04:39:11,360 --> 04:39:11,840
Whatever.

4494
04:39:12,400 --> 04:39:24,599
All right.

4495
04:39:24,599 --> 04:39:25,959
This is still connected, right?

4496
04:39:25,959 --> 04:39:29,139
You need tires for the bike.

4497
04:39:29,139 --> 04:39:30,419
Yeah, but there's none in there.

4498
04:39:30,419 --> 04:39:32,520
I take it back.

4499
04:39:33,330 --> 04:39:33,569
See?

4500
04:39:37,380 --> 04:39:37,619
See?

4501
04:39:38,180 --> 04:39:44,849
Oh, Raid from Tomato.

4502
04:39:44,849 --> 04:39:45,569
What's up, Tomato?

4503
04:39:46,209 --> 04:39:47,090
What's going on, everybody?

4504
04:39:47,090 --> 04:39:47,409
Welcome.

4505
04:39:48,049 --> 04:39:50,049
Thanks for the Raid, Tomato.

4506
04:39:50,049 --> 04:39:53,639
Hope you had a good stream, whatever you were just doing.

4507
04:39:53,720 --> 04:39:54,680
Welcome, Raiders.

4508
04:39:55,400 --> 04:40:02,400
You're witnessing a game called The Long Drive.

4509
04:40:02,959 --> 04:40:04,240
You may or may not have seen it before.

4510
04:40:04,799 --> 04:40:09,520
I am currently about 20 minutes away from the world record.

4511
04:40:09,520 --> 04:40:12,639
So really trying to get that world record.

4512
04:40:12,639 --> 04:40:19,909
Did the bike fall off?

4513
04:40:19,909 --> 04:40:20,869
No, stop lying to me.

4514
04:40:20,869 --> 04:40:21,349
What are you doing?

4515
04:40:27,349 --> 04:40:28,549
No, but thanks a lot, Tomato.

4516
04:40:28,549 --> 04:40:29,270
Hope you're doing well.

4517
04:40:29,270 --> 04:40:30,310
Thanks for the Raid.

4518
04:40:30,310 --> 04:40:34,770
Let's continue our, if you don't know Tomato, go follow him right now.

4519
04:40:34,770 --> 04:40:35,409
What are you, crazy?

4520
04:40:35,970 --> 04:40:44,659
Water tower or the pyramid?

4521
04:40:44,659 --> 04:40:49,569
Keep your eyes on the road.

4522
04:40:49,569 --> 04:40:51,330
Sing the welcome Raider song.

4523
04:40:51,330 --> 04:40:58,279
No, because even the welcome Raider song joke song will make them all leave.

4524
04:40:58,279 --> 04:40:59,000
I know it will.

4525
04:40:59,000 --> 04:40:59,479
Trust me.

4526
04:41:01,840 --> 04:41:02,720
Pay attention.

4527
04:41:02,720 --> 04:41:04,560
Don't, okay, I'm going too fast.

4528
04:41:04,560 --> 04:41:06,400
I got, I got, I got a carriage now.

4529
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:07,439
I got a carriage.

4530
04:41:07,439 --> 04:41:11,220
I need two tires and I need a battery.

4531
04:41:11,220 --> 04:41:12,979
Were you guys lying about the battery or what?

4532
04:41:13,540 --> 04:41:18,389
Actually, it is kind of like a pyramid.

4533
04:41:18,389 --> 04:41:22,759
Can I go in there?

4534
04:41:22,759 --> 04:41:24,840
You need four tires on the bike?

4535
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:28,000
No, you don't.

4536
04:41:28,000 --> 04:41:28,959
It's a bike.

4537
04:41:28,959 --> 04:41:32,049
The reason why it's called a bicycle is because it has two wheels.

4538
04:41:32,849 --> 04:41:34,049
And it's a sickle.

4539
04:41:34,049 --> 04:41:35,860
Where I have something.

4540
04:41:35,860 --> 04:41:36,580
I don't know.

4541
04:41:36,580 --> 04:41:46,450
Cycle.

4542
04:41:46,450 --> 04:41:48,130
Yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a two cycle.

4543
04:41:48,130 --> 04:41:50,840
It means it's two wheels on the bike.

4544
04:41:50,840 --> 04:41:59,360
What's that noise?

4545
04:42:02,240 --> 04:42:03,119
What does that sound?

4546
04:42:07,060 --> 04:42:07,860
Stop.

4547
04:42:07,860 --> 04:42:10,919
What's the problem?

4548
04:42:10,919 --> 04:42:12,200
Oh, this doesn't have wheels.

4549
04:42:12,200 --> 04:42:12,759
Right.

4550
04:42:12,759 --> 04:42:14,279
This doesn't have wheels.

4551
04:42:14,279 --> 04:42:23,000
Is it smoking?

4552
04:42:29,409 --> 04:42:30,369
No, it's fine.

4553
04:42:31,330 --> 04:42:32,689
It's smoking, but whatever.

4554
04:42:33,409 --> 04:42:34,849
Get your hand off.

4555
04:42:34,849 --> 04:42:35,250
What are you doing?

4556
04:42:35,250 --> 04:42:35,970
Get your hands off that.

4557
04:42:35,970 --> 04:42:37,090
Get your hand off that.

4558
04:42:37,090 --> 04:42:38,049
Why is he still holding it?

4559
04:42:38,849 --> 04:42:40,610
Why is he still holding that and shaking it around?

4560
04:42:40,610 --> 04:42:41,090
What's he doing?

4561
04:42:41,810 --> 04:42:46,840
Stop that.

4562
04:42:47,479 --> 04:42:49,319
Uh, who's the guy in this?

4563
04:42:49,319 --> 04:42:52,599
This isn't even the backseat holding a gun up to my body.

4564
04:42:53,479 --> 04:42:53,979
Drive.

4565
04:42:54,759 --> 04:42:55,479
I'm going, man.

4566
04:42:55,479 --> 04:42:55,959
I'm going.

4567
04:42:55,959 --> 04:42:56,520
That's right.

4568
04:42:56,520 --> 04:42:58,040
Keep going until you get to the bank.

4569
04:43:03,569 --> 04:43:04,689
I'm doing that.

4570
04:43:04,689 --> 04:43:05,729
It's okay.

4571
04:43:05,729 --> 04:43:08,290
The screeching is me doing that.

4572
04:43:10,290 --> 04:43:13,250
I can't go more than 40 miles per hour because the game's making me do this.

4573
04:43:16,450 --> 04:43:17,490
I can't even hit the brake.

4574
04:43:18,130 --> 04:43:31,119
Why won't he take his hand off the clutch?

4575
04:43:31,840 --> 04:43:36,610
Take your hand off.

4576
04:43:36,610 --> 04:43:37,729
Take your hand off.

4577
04:43:39,509 --> 04:43:41,430
Oh, I'm sitting in the other seat.

4578
04:43:41,430 --> 04:43:47,540
Okay, we're good.

4579
04:43:50,200 --> 04:43:51,479
Okay, there we go.

4580
04:43:51,479 --> 04:43:57,509
He's still doing it.

4581
04:44:01,220 --> 04:44:02,740
I need wheels for the bike.

4582
04:44:04,759 --> 04:44:05,319
There we go.

4583
04:44:07,139 --> 04:44:08,500
Get your hand off.

4584
04:44:08,500 --> 04:44:09,860
Stop touching the clutch.

4585
04:44:10,900 --> 04:44:12,340
Stop touching the transmission thing.

4586
04:44:15,119 --> 04:44:16,560
Rip the clutch out and throw it out the window.

4587
04:44:16,560 --> 04:44:17,200
I don't think you can.

4588
04:44:17,919 --> 04:44:24,639
What is this bit?

4589
04:44:25,200 --> 04:44:27,200
Uh, it's me driving the car.

4590
04:44:27,200 --> 04:44:28,159
It's the whole game, man.

4591
04:44:28,720 --> 04:44:36,319
That's not a clutch.

4592
04:44:36,319 --> 04:44:36,959
You know what I mean?

4593
04:44:36,959 --> 04:44:39,360
The stick that you move to drive the car.

4594
04:44:40,000 --> 04:44:41,430
You put it in drive.

4595
04:44:41,430 --> 04:44:42,150
You put it in reverse.

4596
04:44:42,709 --> 04:44:43,380
Uh-oh.

4597
04:44:47,159 --> 04:44:48,040
Gear stick.

4598
04:44:48,040 --> 04:44:50,369
Yeah, you get it.

4599
04:44:50,369 --> 04:44:53,119
All right, what do you guys want for food?

4600
04:44:53,680 --> 04:44:54,639
And by what do you want food?

4601
04:44:54,639 --> 04:44:58,560
I mean, what should I get for food in like a minute when the stream ends?

4602
04:45:01,189 --> 04:45:02,069
No, no McDonald's.

4603
04:45:02,069 --> 04:45:02,790
I'm over that for now.

4604
04:45:09,060 --> 04:45:10,580
Um, something's going on in the back.

4605
04:45:11,520 --> 04:45:12,319
Is the bike still there?

4606
04:45:12,880 --> 04:45:21,810
It's still there.

4607
04:45:28,720 --> 04:45:29,599
Mayonnaise sandwich.

4608
04:45:29,599 --> 04:45:30,000
No, thanks.

4609
04:45:30,000 --> 04:45:30,799
That doesn't sound good.

4610
04:45:32,599 --> 04:45:33,240
Italian food.

4611
04:45:33,240 --> 04:45:33,959
Mmm.

4612
04:45:33,959 --> 04:45:34,919
What kind of, what kind?

4613
04:45:35,479 --> 04:45:36,950
I mean, like pasta?

4614
04:45:36,950 --> 04:45:38,229
You mean like meatballs?

4615
04:45:38,229 --> 04:45:39,779
What do you mean?

4616
04:45:39,779 --> 04:45:40,259
Pizza?

4617
04:45:40,259 --> 04:45:42,500
Eh, I'm not into pizza right now.

4618
04:45:42,500 --> 04:45:43,000
Something else.

4619
04:45:45,349 --> 04:45:45,990
Korean food.

4620
04:45:45,990 --> 04:45:46,389
Mmm.

4621
04:45:46,389 --> 04:45:48,470
That's actually pretty, that sounds good.

4622
04:45:49,270 --> 04:45:50,229
Waffle house, maybe.

4623
04:45:51,029 --> 04:46:04,840
I'll have to think about it.

4624
04:46:04,840 --> 04:46:09,200
I'll get back to you later.

4625
04:46:16,310 --> 04:46:17,430
Kiss me on the mouth.

4626
04:46:17,430 --> 04:46:18,150
That's not food.

4627
04:46:19,430 --> 04:46:19,830
But no.

4628
04:46:20,389 --> 04:46:25,650
This thing is so hard to control because of the shit behind me.

4629
04:46:27,830 --> 04:46:29,169
Okay.

4630
04:46:29,169 --> 04:46:31,639
Just got a super speed boost somehow.

4631
04:46:32,200 --> 04:46:33,159
I just did the sonic.

4632
04:46:33,159 --> 04:46:34,759
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4633
04:46:34,759 --> 04:46:36,180
And then went forward.

4634
04:46:38,479 --> 04:46:38,959
Interesting.

4635
04:46:38,959 --> 04:46:39,759
Now I'm over 100.

4636
04:46:40,479 --> 04:46:45,270
Is that thing still there?

4637
04:46:49,250 --> 04:46:52,529
Uh, okay.

4638
04:46:52,529 --> 04:46:55,889
It's the, it's the little, it's the pole trailer behind me that's doing it.

4639
04:46:55,889 --> 04:46:57,009
Going right for that pole.

4640
04:46:57,970 --> 04:46:58,470
Aye.

4641
04:46:58,930 --> 04:47:01,330
Oh, it's just bouncing around everywhere, ain't it?

4642
04:47:02,049 --> 04:47:06,869
We're fine.

4643
04:47:07,509 --> 04:47:12,500
Get rid of it, please.

4644
04:47:12,500 --> 04:47:13,220
I'm still fine.

4645
04:47:13,860 --> 04:47:19,720
Stop getting out.

4646
04:47:19,720 --> 04:47:21,479
Well, I'm freaking out because I don't know if it's still there.

4647
04:47:24,159 --> 04:47:25,279
I will put wheels on it.

4648
04:47:25,279 --> 04:47:26,080
I will.

4649
04:47:26,080 --> 04:47:28,529
Press B to check the bike.

4650
04:47:29,330 --> 04:47:40,959
No, just making sure there's no shit on the seat.

4651
04:47:41,599 --> 04:47:47,860
Wait, can I drive from the other seat?

4652
04:47:48,500 --> 04:47:51,590
Can I grab the wheel from the passenger seat?

4653
04:48:01,990 --> 04:48:02,709
Nope.

4654
04:48:02,709 --> 04:48:09,639
Go inside the pyramid.

4655
04:48:13,279 --> 04:48:18,130
I'm kind of, I really want to ride the motorcycle so bad.

4656
04:48:19,490 --> 04:48:22,209
At full speed and not this bullshit pedaling with my feet thing.

4657
04:48:22,209 --> 04:48:23,169
I want to go full speed.

4658
04:48:24,580 --> 04:48:25,779
On the motorcycle.

4659
04:48:26,580 --> 04:48:43,200
Is that a building?

4660
04:48:44,340 --> 04:48:46,020
Oh God, this bullshit again.

4661
04:48:46,020 --> 04:48:46,580
All right.

4662
04:48:46,580 --> 04:48:53,830
I need to, I was trying to block the sun out of my eyes.

4663
04:48:53,830 --> 04:49:06,599
That's better.

4664
04:49:07,220 --> 04:49:07,720
Sun's gone.

4665
04:49:10,450 --> 04:49:10,950
Shit!

4666
04:49:13,119 --> 04:49:13,619
It's fine.

4667
04:49:14,000 --> 04:49:14,959
It's fine.

4668
04:49:14,959 --> 04:49:15,360
It's fine.

4669
04:49:15,360 --> 04:49:15,759
It's fine.

4670
04:49:15,759 --> 04:49:16,259
We're fine.

4671
04:49:16,799 --> 04:49:17,919
Are we?

4672
04:49:17,919 --> 04:49:18,419
Are we though?

4673
04:49:19,040 --> 04:49:19,540
Are we though?

4674
04:49:21,599 --> 04:49:22,240
Are we though?

4675
04:49:25,779 --> 04:49:26,979
Oh, watch out for that thing!

4676
04:49:27,619 --> 04:49:51,090
It's a pothead.

4677
04:49:51,090 --> 04:49:53,009
I'm not, I'm not, I've had none.

4678
04:49:53,009 --> 04:49:54,610
I've had none today.

4679
04:49:55,169 --> 04:49:57,599
I was feeling, I was feeling okay today.

4680
04:49:57,599 --> 04:49:58,240
Chest wise.

4681
04:49:58,240 --> 04:49:59,919
I didn't, I don't need to take it right now.

4682
04:49:59,919 --> 04:50:02,020
I'm saying that or you're going to get banned.

4683
04:50:04,069 --> 04:50:04,569
Idiot.

4684
04:50:27,080 --> 04:50:29,560
Okay, that, somebody is standing right behind here.

4685
04:50:29,560 --> 04:50:32,209
Crouching where the other tire is on the other side.

4686
04:50:32,209 --> 04:50:34,450
They scared me with a puppet and threw it behind them.

4687
04:50:34,450 --> 04:50:37,200
And then they're hiding under the car.

4688
04:50:37,200 --> 04:50:39,439
I'm going to go investigate this fucking thing and the car is going to take off.

4689
04:50:40,000 --> 04:50:44,520
God damn it, man.

4690
04:50:45,319 --> 04:51:08,369
Hey, I told you I was going to need this.

4691
04:51:08,369 --> 04:51:10,290
Great, I really used it well.

4692
04:51:10,290 --> 04:51:24,630
Let's go.

4693
04:51:24,630 --> 04:51:26,069
Oh, I'm not going to bring Wilson.

4694
04:51:26,069 --> 04:51:27,270
I need a new house.

4695
04:51:44,529 --> 04:51:45,490
You have a nice hall.

4696
04:51:48,099 --> 04:51:49,939
Please say that you'll play this again.

4697
04:51:49,939 --> 04:51:50,419
I don't know.

4698
04:51:51,060 --> 04:51:52,419
Maybe if it gets some more updates.

4699
04:51:52,419 --> 04:51:53,860
Isn't it currently not done?

4700
04:51:54,659 --> 04:51:58,279
I'm going to hit that rock, aren't I?

4701
04:51:58,279 --> 04:52:03,000
Nope.

4702
04:52:03,000 --> 04:52:03,500
Sleep?

4703
04:52:03,959 --> 04:52:23,029
Okay, the tank is now in the front seat.

4704
04:52:33,889 --> 04:52:35,650
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4705
04:52:38,599 --> 04:52:40,040
Just draining into my mouth.

4706
04:52:44,290 --> 04:52:45,169
Oh, God damn it.

4707
04:52:45,169 --> 04:52:46,130
There's a thing right here too.

4708
04:52:46,689 --> 04:52:53,029
Just reload the bucket save.

4709
04:52:53,029 --> 04:52:53,830
I don't care.

4710
04:52:53,830 --> 04:52:54,630
Where is it?

4711
04:52:54,630 --> 04:52:56,759
This one here, right?

4712
04:52:56,759 --> 04:52:59,569
20, 09, 24, 16, 34.

4713
04:52:59,569 --> 04:53:00,610
Which one is it?

4714
04:53:00,610 --> 04:53:05,349
This one, right?

4715
04:53:05,349 --> 04:53:06,229
This one.

4716
04:53:06,229 --> 04:53:13,349
Reload Randy.

4717
04:53:13,349 --> 04:53:14,549
Well, load last.

4718
04:53:14,549 --> 04:53:15,189
Oh, oh shit.

4719
04:53:15,189 --> 04:53:19,939
Okay, we're good.

4720
04:53:20,500 --> 04:53:44,400
But the car turned off.

4721
04:53:45,040 --> 04:53:46,720
The bike is not gone.

4722
04:53:47,439 --> 04:53:51,090
The bike is still there.

4723
04:53:51,090 --> 04:53:51,569
There it is.

4724
04:53:51,569 --> 04:53:52,130
There's the thing.

4725
04:53:54,709 --> 04:53:55,669
Bike is there.

4726
04:53:55,669 --> 04:53:57,459
Look, that's bike.

4727
04:53:58,099 --> 04:54:05,909
These little bus stops.

4728
04:54:05,909 --> 04:54:07,590
Why can't I find a bus?

4729
04:54:07,590 --> 04:54:09,669
I got one in the very beginning of the game.

4730
04:54:09,669 --> 04:54:11,029
I didn't have any gas or any diesel.

4731
04:54:11,029 --> 04:54:11,669
I couldn't use it.

4732
04:54:12,470 --> 04:54:13,919
I want to drive a bus so bad.

4733
04:54:14,479 --> 04:54:15,200
You have no idea.

4734
04:54:15,919 --> 04:54:20,709
All right, looking for tires.

4735
04:54:21,270 --> 04:54:24,529
If I see a tire, I'm going to be really happy.

4736
04:54:25,250 --> 04:54:26,360
I see one.

4737
04:54:27,080 --> 04:54:28,930
I see a tire.

4738
04:54:29,650 --> 04:54:40,209
That's kind of huge though.

4739
04:54:40,209 --> 04:54:42,369
Will this work?

4740
04:54:42,369 --> 04:54:43,090
Can I even put it on?

4741
04:54:43,729 --> 04:54:48,119
This shit ain't going to work.

4742
04:54:48,119 --> 04:54:49,000
It's too big.

4743
04:54:49,000 --> 04:55:06,369
Can I paint the bike?

4744
04:55:06,369 --> 04:55:08,450
Oh, there we go.

4745
04:55:09,409 --> 04:55:09,909
Working.

4746
04:55:19,799 --> 04:55:21,240
Spray paint your face.

4747
04:55:21,240 --> 04:55:21,740
No.

4748
04:56:10,389 --> 04:56:10,790
Empty?

4749
04:56:10,790 --> 04:56:11,110
What?

4750
04:56:11,110 --> 04:56:11,830
I just...

4751
04:56:11,830 --> 04:56:15,540
A new bumper.

4752
04:56:16,659 --> 04:56:17,159
Definitely.

4753
04:56:19,509 --> 04:56:21,430
Oh, look at this thing.

4754
04:56:21,430 --> 04:56:24,389
This is Radio SteelPens News.

4755
04:56:24,389 --> 04:56:25,990
The latest news for you.

4756
04:56:28,729 --> 04:56:30,409
Today, it's harder than ever.

4757
04:56:30,409 --> 04:56:35,479
I can say, seriously, I wanted to tell you some news,

4758
04:56:35,479 --> 04:56:38,439
but since 90% of the people died in the apocalypse,

4759
04:56:38,439 --> 04:56:39,959
I can't really tell you anything.

4760
04:56:40,759 --> 04:56:44,840
But I can bring you some amazing ball-busting rap music.

4761
04:56:44,840 --> 04:56:45,799
Listen to this.

4762
04:56:53,880 --> 04:56:55,080
What the fuck am I doing?

4763
04:56:55,080 --> 04:56:55,959
Disgusting.

4764
04:56:55,959 --> 04:56:56,459
Why?

4765
04:57:05,509 --> 04:57:09,430
Let's store it in here.

4766
04:57:11,830 --> 04:57:13,509
This is way too loud.

4767
04:57:14,470 --> 04:57:28,860
We're on 98.4.

4768
04:57:29,580 --> 04:57:55,849
Oh no, tires.

4769
04:57:55,849 --> 04:57:56,250
Stop.

4770
04:57:56,250 --> 04:57:56,750
What?

4771
04:58:03,130 --> 04:58:04,409
Get it out of my hands.

4772
04:58:04,409 --> 04:58:05,529
Get it off my hands.

4773
04:58:05,529 --> 04:58:06,029
Ew.

4774
04:58:06,409 --> 04:58:07,209
Disgusting.

4775
04:58:07,209 --> 04:58:08,330
Get rid of this.

4776
04:58:08,330 --> 04:58:08,830
Get rid...

4777
04:58:18,919 --> 04:58:19,720
Put this back on.

4778
04:58:25,849 --> 04:58:26,970
There's more?

4779
04:58:26,970 --> 04:58:28,810
Oh shit, there is.

4780
04:58:28,810 --> 04:58:30,250
Oh my god.

4781
04:58:30,250 --> 04:58:31,610
Why is there so much of this?

4782
04:58:38,979 --> 04:58:40,099
I don't want to show that in the vlog.

4783
04:58:43,720 --> 04:58:45,240
This is like MIDI vlog music.

4784
04:58:46,259 --> 04:58:47,220
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

4785
04:58:47,220 --> 04:58:48,180
Vlog music, right.

4786
04:58:48,180 --> 04:58:48,740
Okay, hold on.

4787
04:58:49,459 --> 04:59:32,299
Pay attention.

4788
04:59:32,299 --> 04:59:33,259
The road is...

4789
04:59:36,020 --> 04:59:37,860
You're just watching a vlog in this slowly,

4790
04:59:37,860 --> 04:59:40,580
just going way off the fucking road.

4791
04:59:40,580 --> 04:59:43,779
It's like, whoa, dude, somebody should probably pay attention.

4792
04:59:47,799 --> 04:59:48,520
Where are they?

4793
04:59:51,669 --> 04:59:52,790
I can't crash like that.

4794
04:59:52,790 --> 04:59:53,830
I know you all want me to,

4795
04:59:53,830 --> 04:59:56,150
but it would be over at that point.

4796
04:59:56,150 --> 04:59:57,189
I'm not going to start over.

4797
04:59:57,189 --> 04:59:59,509
This is NeonSynth Radio.

4798
04:59:59,509 --> 05:00:00,310
Get on the road.

4799
05:00:00,790 --> 05:00:05,060
There is almost as hot as me, my friends.

4800
05:00:05,060 --> 05:00:07,419
Well, really, I am much, much...

4801
05:00:07,419 --> 05:00:12,150
Last week, we had a call that said...

4802
05:00:12,150 --> 05:00:12,950
I missed the mirror.

4803
05:00:12,950 --> 05:00:13,430
Don't you...

4804
05:00:13,430 --> 05:00:14,790
I so badly missed the mirror.

4805
05:00:14,790 --> 05:00:17,669
...steel pants radio, but seriously,

4806
05:00:17,669 --> 05:00:19,669
how can you say something like that?

4807
05:00:19,669 --> 05:00:22,229
I mean, that dude is a douchebag,

4808
05:00:22,229 --> 05:00:24,869
and he has serious personality disorders,

4809
05:00:24,869 --> 05:00:27,779
or bipolar, or bisexual stuff,

4810
05:00:27,779 --> 05:00:28,900
or I don't know.

4811
05:00:28,900 --> 05:00:32,259
And he even works alone because everyone hates him.

4812
05:00:32,259 --> 05:00:34,819
I have so much coworkers,

4813
05:00:34,819 --> 05:00:41,860
and he has, guess what, not NeonSynth Radio FM 98.4.

4814
05:00:41,860 --> 05:00:43,860
Some weather forecast for you guys.

4815
05:00:43,860 --> 05:00:46,659
Mostly the weather will be sunny,

4816
05:00:46,659 --> 05:00:49,060
just like my life and yours.

4817
05:00:49,060 --> 05:00:53,380
Let's make it even better with one of my favorite songs.

4818
05:00:53,380 --> 05:00:54,900
Jennifer, hit it.

4819
05:00:54,900 --> 05:01:04,470
NeonSynth Radio FM 98.4.

4820
05:01:04,470 --> 05:01:05,270
Jeremy, what?

4821
05:01:05,909 --> 05:01:08,180
More mirror jokes.

4822
05:01:08,180 --> 05:01:08,580
That's not...

4823
05:01:08,580 --> 05:01:09,380
I just can't...

4824
05:01:09,380 --> 05:01:10,020
I have to look.

4825
05:01:10,819 --> 05:01:13,979
Isn't there an animal that if it sees its reflection,

4826
05:01:13,979 --> 05:01:15,419
it freezes and just goes,

4827
05:01:15,419 --> 05:01:16,700
I need to stare at you now.

4828
05:01:16,700 --> 05:01:17,580
Whatever it is, that's me.

4829
05:01:18,380 --> 05:01:19,180
All right, new radio.

4830
05:01:32,540 --> 05:01:34,139
The same guys on every radio station.

4831
05:01:34,779 --> 05:01:40,819
There we go.

4832
05:01:40,819 --> 05:01:51,299
I would love to find a tire.

4833
05:01:51,299 --> 05:01:52,020
That would be great.

4834
05:01:52,580 --> 05:01:57,509
It's too loud.

4835
05:02:09,740 --> 05:02:10,619
Max volume.

4836
05:02:10,619 --> 05:02:12,139
I don't think I want to do that to you guys.

4837
05:02:12,700 --> 05:02:13,580
I feel like that would hurt.

4838
05:02:23,479 --> 05:02:24,200
Fine.

4839
05:02:24,200 --> 05:02:28,869
Okay, I'm gonna...

4840
05:02:29,990 --> 05:02:33,779
That's way too loud.

4841
05:02:33,779 --> 05:02:34,340
I don't like it.

4842
05:02:39,450 --> 05:02:40,090
Normal level.

4843
05:02:40,810 --> 05:03:00,869
Drive on the road.

4844
05:03:01,430 --> 05:03:02,069
Yeah, I know.

4845
05:03:02,069 --> 05:03:03,669
But isn't the road probably more dangerous

4846
05:03:03,669 --> 05:03:04,950
because of random rocks?

4847
05:03:04,950 --> 05:03:07,139
I can see the rocks from a mile away

4848
05:03:07,139 --> 05:03:08,340
if I drive on the other side.

4849
05:03:11,500 --> 05:03:12,540
Louder and floor it.

4850
05:03:12,540 --> 05:03:14,459
This is as fast as this little shitty engine can go.

4851
05:03:17,369 --> 05:03:18,729
It can't go much faster than this.

4852
05:03:19,290 --> 05:03:28,759
Look, you want to see?

4853
05:03:29,400 --> 05:03:30,360
You want to see the engine?

4854
05:03:31,159 --> 05:03:31,400
Look.

4855
05:03:32,200 --> 05:03:33,400
It's not very good.

4856
05:03:34,659 --> 05:03:35,779
It's pretty slow.

4857
05:03:38,200 --> 05:03:38,599
Hold on.

4858
05:03:39,400 --> 05:03:45,459
I gotta give it a little more extra cooling.

4859
05:03:57,369 --> 05:03:58,250
On every station.

4860
05:03:58,250 --> 05:03:58,889
Get out of here.

4861
05:03:58,889 --> 05:04:04,619
All right.

4862
05:04:04,619 --> 05:04:06,599
All right, if I'm going fast enough,

4863
05:04:06,599 --> 05:04:10,200
can this start to spray out into my mouth

4864
05:04:10,200 --> 05:04:11,639
and I can drink it while I'm driving?

4865
05:04:12,680 --> 05:04:16,869
Can I just drink this coolant while I'm driving?

4866
05:04:17,509 --> 05:04:18,549
If it goes fast enough?

4867
05:04:19,349 --> 05:04:20,069
Close the cap.

4868
05:04:20,069 --> 05:04:20,549
Hold on.

4869
05:04:20,549 --> 05:04:21,110
I got it.

4870
05:04:22,779 --> 05:04:23,419
It is open.

4871
05:04:23,419 --> 05:04:23,979
You're right.

4872
05:04:27,689 --> 05:04:29,290
Why do I want to do this so bad?

4873
05:04:29,290 --> 05:04:30,250
It's not even funny.

4874
05:04:34,819 --> 05:04:35,380
Okay, what...

4875
05:04:35,380 --> 05:04:35,860
Wait.

4876
05:04:36,020 --> 05:04:36,259
funny

4877
05:04:56,759 --> 05:04:58,599
Goddamn, what a long road trip this is.

4878
05:04:59,400 --> 05:05:04,229
I'm getting so fucking thirsty.

4879
05:05:05,110 --> 05:05:06,630
And I got no Gatorade in the car.

4880
05:05:07,509 --> 05:05:08,229
That's empty.

4881
05:05:12,810 --> 05:05:14,330
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

4882
05:05:26,299 --> 05:05:27,180
I can't drink it.

4883
05:05:27,180 --> 05:05:27,740
I'm trying.

4884
05:05:28,060 --> 05:05:30,779
I have to use your two-stroke vehicle urgently.

4885
05:05:30,779 --> 05:05:33,419
Someone, please give me a two-stroke now.

4886
05:05:33,419 --> 05:05:39,659
I have to go to the toilet urgently, but I only drive with a two-stroke vehicle into the toilet.

4887
05:05:44,619 --> 05:05:45,580
We go back here?

4888
05:05:45,580 --> 05:05:47,740
Do you want to be you in the backseat?

4889
05:05:47,740 --> 05:05:53,750
Germany is always the best.

4890
05:05:53,750 --> 05:05:55,189
Oh, fuck! That's a pole!

4891
05:05:55,189 --> 05:05:56,549
It has sand, but it also has a lot of dust.

4892
05:05:56,549 --> 05:05:57,909
Alright, it's you in the backseat, guys.

4893
05:05:57,909 --> 05:06:00,069
Yes, you have a good ear tip, panna.

4894
05:06:00,069 --> 05:06:03,669
Germany still has a small forest.

4895
05:06:03,669 --> 05:06:07,659
Are we there yet, are we there yet?

4896
05:06:07,659 --> 05:06:11,819
Shut up! Quiet back there!

4897
05:06:13,180 --> 05:06:16,740
We've got another 250 miles at least.

4898
05:06:16,740 --> 05:06:19,380
Here, have some drinks of gasoline.

4899
05:06:20,700 --> 05:06:21,580
You'll feel better.

4900
05:06:24,840 --> 05:06:25,720
I don't like that.

4901
05:06:25,720 --> 05:06:28,119
It's alright, we'll stop somewhere and get some Powerade.

4902
05:06:28,119 --> 05:06:29,720
The purple Powerade, my favorite.

4903
05:06:38,060 --> 05:06:39,020
Want to sing a car song?

4904
05:06:39,740 --> 05:06:41,259
Um, no.

4905
05:06:43,180 --> 05:06:48,060
I spy with my little eye something that is orange.

4906
05:06:52,549 --> 05:06:53,909
Is it the sky?

4907
05:06:53,909 --> 05:06:54,389
You got it!

4908
05:06:54,389 --> 05:06:55,189
That's my son!

4909
05:06:55,189 --> 05:06:55,669
He got it!

4910
05:06:55,669 --> 05:06:57,909
It's the sky and everything else.

4911
05:06:57,909 --> 05:06:58,549
You got it!

4912
05:07:00,069 --> 05:07:01,860
Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

4913
05:07:01,860 --> 05:07:02,360
Shh!

4914
05:07:03,500 --> 05:07:03,979
We got him.

4915
05:07:03,979 --> 05:07:05,180
We got a little bit of him.

4916
05:07:05,180 --> 05:07:06,540
Dad's going to get out of the car for a bit.

4917
05:07:08,389 --> 05:07:09,110
He's sitting right here.

4918
05:07:09,990 --> 05:07:12,580
Here, just put on your favorite radio.

4919
05:07:15,299 --> 05:07:16,580
Dad, I'll be back in a few minutes.

4920
05:07:18,099 --> 05:07:18,580
I'll be back.

4921
05:07:18,580 --> 05:07:20,580
Oh, let's just go to bed.

4922
05:07:35,080 --> 05:07:39,400
It's so funny with the car idling at volume 10.

4923
05:07:40,680 --> 05:07:41,720
This poor kid.

4924
05:07:45,290 --> 05:07:50,389
Oh, just do F10 for the kids cam.

4925
05:07:51,029 --> 05:07:53,779
Do I have four?

4926
05:07:53,779 --> 05:07:54,279
Okay.

4927
05:08:00,630 --> 05:08:01,130
Hey!

4928
05:08:05,430 --> 05:08:08,630
Try to keep my eye on the road, son.

4929
05:08:09,270 --> 05:08:11,740
Done.

4930
05:08:12,279 --> 05:08:13,080
Yeah.

4931
05:08:13,080 --> 05:08:14,580
We'll be back in a few minutes.

4932
05:08:14,580 --> 05:08:15,540
Just hang tight.

4933
05:08:16,340 --> 05:08:18,659
If you get thirsty, just bring a gasoline in the backseat.

4934
05:08:23,959 --> 05:08:31,290
Don't go anywhere.

4935
05:08:31,290 --> 05:08:32,330
Hey, son!

4936
05:08:32,330 --> 05:08:33,049
Hey, son!

4937
05:08:33,049 --> 05:08:33,930
I found something!

4938
05:08:34,490 --> 05:08:35,450
I found something!

4939
05:08:36,009 --> 05:08:42,119
This is going to look real good.

4940
05:08:42,759 --> 05:08:46,680
Your favorite color, blue.

4941
05:08:47,479 --> 05:08:48,389
You see it?

4942
05:08:50,099 --> 05:08:53,639
Oh, I got to be careful.

4943
05:08:53,639 --> 05:08:55,159
Blue's not my favorite color.

4944
05:08:55,799 --> 05:08:56,680
That's, son.

4945
05:08:56,680 --> 05:08:57,180
What happened?

4946
05:08:58,060 --> 05:08:59,099
Oh, I didn't hear you.

4947
05:08:59,099 --> 05:09:00,459
I thought you said blue's my favorite color.

4948
05:09:01,099 --> 05:09:06,169
Hey, your dear old dad will be right back.

4949
05:09:15,270 --> 05:09:18,150
And look what your dear old dad just found.

4950
05:09:18,869 --> 05:09:21,259
People leave this crazy shit around, son.

4951
05:09:21,259 --> 05:09:23,419
Yellow power rate.

4952
05:09:26,040 --> 05:09:33,130
What's up?

4953
05:09:33,130 --> 05:09:35,610
Son, we got a problem here.

4954
05:09:35,610 --> 05:09:36,110
Son!

4955
05:09:37,209 --> 05:09:42,810
Turn it on.

4956
05:09:42,810 --> 05:09:48,580
There's a fucking UFO.

4957
05:09:59,189 --> 05:10:00,549
Dad, I didn't see anything.

4958
05:10:00,549 --> 05:10:01,349
What are you talking about?

4959
05:10:01,990 --> 05:10:03,430
You didn't see the UFO fly overhead?

4960
05:10:04,709 --> 05:10:06,869
Dad, I didn't see anything at all.

4961
05:10:09,639 --> 05:10:10,200
Are you sure?

4962
05:10:11,529 --> 05:10:12,029
No.

4963
05:10:12,490 --> 05:10:14,490
There was food, I think, in that house.

4964
05:10:14,490 --> 05:10:14,729
Food?

4965
05:10:14,729 --> 05:10:15,290
What are you talking about?

4966
05:10:15,290 --> 05:10:16,250
Are you fucking crazy?

4967
05:10:17,130 --> 05:10:18,490
The UFO just flew overhead.

4968
05:10:18,490 --> 05:10:19,130
What are you, a dove?

4969
05:10:21,819 --> 05:10:24,299
I don't want to drink anymore.

4970
05:10:24,299 --> 05:10:26,220
I think you should stop drinking gasoline.

4971
05:10:28,119 --> 05:10:30,520
Gasoline is the most delicious fluid there is.

4972
05:10:34,180 --> 05:10:34,900
Don't move.

4973
05:10:34,900 --> 05:10:35,619
You won't get hurt.

4974
05:10:47,189 --> 05:10:48,630
Okay, we're going back on the road.

4975
05:10:48,630 --> 05:10:49,750
I'm going to catch that UFO.

4976
05:11:01,049 --> 05:11:01,549
Rabbit!

4977
05:11:02,090 --> 05:11:06,459
Dad, why did you do that?

4978
05:11:07,349 --> 05:11:07,849
What?

4979
05:11:28,580 --> 05:11:29,139
Hey, son.

4980
05:11:29,700 --> 05:11:30,819
Did you know your dad could do this?

4981
05:11:35,110 --> 05:11:36,069
Oh my god.

4982
05:11:37,540 --> 05:11:39,700
Yeah, your dad looks kind of like Beetlejuice, doesn't he?

4983
05:11:40,419 --> 05:11:55,130
Can you drop me off at the sound?

4984
05:11:55,939 --> 05:11:57,700
Is it piercing my ears?

4985
05:11:58,259 --> 05:12:05,220
I'm missing a tire?

4986
05:12:05,939 --> 05:12:07,580
What?

4987
05:12:21,080 --> 05:12:30,459
Wait, put this back on.

4988
05:12:30,459 --> 05:12:31,340
The spare.

4989
05:12:31,340 --> 05:12:32,459
Yeah, it's all right.

4990
05:12:32,459 --> 05:12:32,959
Whatever.

4991
05:12:34,409 --> 05:12:35,529
Is it front wheel drive?

4992
05:12:36,090 --> 05:12:53,139
If it's front wheel drive, then I'm just taking this off.

4993
05:12:53,139 --> 05:12:54,180
It's rear wheel drive.

4994
05:12:54,180 --> 05:12:56,500
It's rear wheel drive.

4995
05:12:56,500 --> 05:13:10,919
Okay, two rear tires.

4996
05:13:10,919 --> 05:13:15,459
This one kind of looks messed up, though, doesn't it?

4997
05:13:15,459 --> 05:13:18,470
It's one of the door.

4998
05:13:18,470 --> 05:13:25,909
No, we're good.

4999
05:13:25,909 --> 05:13:27,270
All right, we just need a gas station.

5000
05:13:29,860 --> 05:13:30,659
Hey, doobie roller.

5001
05:13:30,659 --> 05:13:32,020
Thanks for the 10 community subs, doobie.

5002
05:13:32,580 --> 05:13:36,540
I'll take them.

5003
05:13:37,020 --> 05:13:37,979
It's 10 subs.

5004
05:13:38,540 --> 05:13:39,509
Thanks, dude.

5005
05:13:40,069 --> 05:13:50,979
Scooby dooby roller.

5006
05:13:50,979 --> 05:13:52,659
Oh, fuck, I'm hungry.

5007
05:13:52,659 --> 05:13:53,540
What about you?

5008
05:13:53,540 --> 05:13:54,979
All right, I got to make a decision here.

5009
05:13:58,500 --> 05:14:09,740
I'm going to say whatever.

5010
05:14:09,740 --> 05:14:10,380
I can stay there.

5011
05:14:14,069 --> 05:14:14,790
Papa John's.

5012
05:14:16,729 --> 05:14:17,849
Why would I eat Papa John's?

5013
05:14:18,409 --> 05:14:25,930
Papa John's sits in this weird sort of limbo of pizza places.

5014
05:14:25,930 --> 05:14:27,689
It's not that good to order.

5015
05:14:27,689 --> 05:14:29,849
It's not that bad to care about that you ate it.

5016
05:14:31,060 --> 05:14:32,259
But I don't want it.

5017
05:14:39,509 --> 05:14:41,990
There are much better pizza places that I would eat before Papa John's.

5018
05:14:42,069 --> 05:14:42,950
So I would never order it.

5019
05:14:44,790 --> 05:14:45,430
That's just a fact.

5020
05:14:46,389 --> 05:14:47,189
That's just how I feel.

5021
05:14:48,150 --> 05:14:49,270
I haven't you want to hear?

5022
05:14:49,270 --> 05:14:49,830
Here's a fact.

5023
05:14:50,310 --> 05:14:58,389
I have never ever in my entire life picked up the telephone and ordered a pizza from Papa John's.

5024
05:15:00,060 --> 05:15:07,099
There's been maybe three or four times where it was just cold sitting out at somebody's Super Bowl party.

5025
05:15:07,740 --> 05:15:09,419
And I had maybe one or two slices.

5026
05:15:11,830 --> 05:15:12,869
I've never ordered it before.

5027
05:15:13,189 --> 05:15:16,310
I've just eaten it maybe once at a football party game thing.

5028
05:15:17,189 --> 05:15:23,369
How can you judge it then?

5029
05:15:23,369 --> 05:15:24,409
I just don't want it.

5030
05:15:24,409 --> 05:15:24,889
I've had it.

5031
05:15:25,610 --> 05:15:27,290
Look, I just don't want it.

5032
05:15:27,930 --> 05:15:31,959
See, back in Massachusetts, we had Papa Gino's.

5033
05:15:31,959 --> 05:15:33,400
Papa Gino's was way better than Papa John's.

5034
05:15:33,400 --> 05:15:35,080
Papa Gino's was a thousand times better.

5035
05:15:38,650 --> 05:15:41,849
If you ordered Papa John's instead of Papa Gino's and you're from New England.

5036
05:15:41,849 --> 05:15:43,130
Oh my God.

5037
05:15:43,130 --> 05:15:44,250
No, you wouldn't do that.

5038
05:15:44,250 --> 05:15:45,450
There would be no reason for you to do that.

5039
05:15:46,169 --> 05:15:51,900
So now, since I've moved across country, there's no more Papa Gino's anywhere, right?

5040
05:15:51,900 --> 05:15:53,659
That's an East Coast kind of New England thing.

5041
05:15:54,810 --> 05:15:56,889
But I'm not going to order Papa John's still

5042
05:15:56,889 --> 05:15:58,889
because there are other places out here that are better than that.

5043
05:15:59,610 --> 05:16:01,909
Turn on the radio.

5044
05:16:01,909 --> 05:16:02,709
I am the radio.

5045
05:16:15,349 --> 05:16:16,470
Where are the ads?

5046
05:16:17,849 --> 05:16:21,209
Like the mid-roll things that Twitch decided was a great idea.

5047
05:16:21,209 --> 05:16:21,930
I think they deleted them.

5048
05:16:21,930 --> 05:16:22,970
I don't think they exist anymore.

5049
05:16:35,240 --> 05:16:36,759
This car is still going.

5050
05:16:36,759 --> 05:16:38,439
I haven't even used that much gas either.

5051
05:16:39,159 --> 05:16:41,819
I want B, I want B.

5052
05:16:42,619 --> 05:16:57,099
There you go.

5053
05:17:00,459 --> 05:17:00,939
Press C.

5054
05:17:01,580 --> 05:17:03,580
I didn't even know this existed.

5055
05:17:05,590 --> 05:17:07,110
It's been five hours and 20 minutes.

5056
05:17:07,110 --> 05:17:07,990
I didn't even know you could do this.

5057
05:17:29,849 --> 05:17:30,889
Good save.

5058
05:17:30,889 --> 05:17:35,659
I've been driving on three wheels for five hours.

5059
05:17:35,659 --> 05:17:37,900
No, that just happened like maybe 20 minutes ago.

5060
05:17:43,049 --> 05:17:44,090
We got something over here.

5061
05:17:47,029 --> 05:17:48,229
Yeah, I'm aware that I'm missing a wheel.

5062
05:17:48,229 --> 05:17:49,349
What would you like me to do about it?

5063
05:17:49,349 --> 05:17:49,849
Walk?

5064
05:17:56,439 --> 05:18:01,450
I'll get a wheel right here.

5065
05:18:01,450 --> 05:18:04,549
I see a wheel.

5066
05:18:06,740 --> 05:18:08,180
I see a wheel.

5067
05:18:08,180 --> 05:18:09,139
I see a wheel.

5068
05:18:09,139 --> 05:18:10,340
I see two wheels.

5069
05:18:11,139 --> 05:18:12,259
Oh, yeah.

5070
05:18:14,279 --> 05:18:14,779
Yes.

5071
05:18:15,830 --> 05:18:16,330
Yes.

5072
05:18:16,709 --> 05:18:19,290
Take it on there.

5073
05:18:20,619 --> 05:18:21,419
Back in business.

5074
05:18:22,549 --> 05:18:22,950
Hooray.

5075
05:18:22,950 --> 05:18:23,669
All right, there's another one here.

5076
05:18:23,669 --> 05:18:25,930
Let's put it on the trailer.

5077
05:18:33,139 --> 05:18:33,619
Thank God.

5078
05:18:33,619 --> 05:18:34,419
At least I could have one.

5079
05:18:34,979 --> 05:18:41,099
Anything else?

5080
05:18:41,659 --> 05:18:42,330
What's this?

5081
05:18:43,220 --> 05:18:43,860
Ammo?

5082
05:18:43,860 --> 05:18:44,419
I don't care.

5083
05:18:44,419 --> 05:18:45,299
I have a thousand.

5084
05:18:45,299 --> 05:18:55,400
You can change it up a little bit here.

5085
05:18:55,400 --> 05:19:08,360
Maybe a Herman bike?

5086
05:19:09,000 --> 05:19:09,959
Yeah, I think so.

5087
05:19:14,470 --> 05:19:15,990
Cotton candy car.

5088
05:19:15,990 --> 05:19:22,330
Come on, do it.

5089
05:19:22,330 --> 05:19:29,450
I can't believe I'm still playing this though.

5090
05:19:29,450 --> 05:19:30,409
I really can't.

5091
05:19:30,409 --> 05:19:32,220
Why do I like this so much?

5092
05:19:32,220 --> 05:19:33,939
That didn't even go out the window.

5093
05:19:34,580 --> 05:19:36,259
By the way, that would have stuck to the window.

5094
05:19:36,259 --> 05:19:37,459
As disgusting as that sounds.

5095
05:19:38,650 --> 05:19:40,169
Finally, I can actually move.

5096
05:19:40,970 --> 05:19:48,970
That was not a house though.

5097
05:19:55,669 --> 05:19:56,549
That thing on the right.

5098
05:19:57,939 --> 05:19:58,659
It's a gas tank.

5099
05:20:03,770 --> 05:20:06,169
No, it's a Minecraft diamond block.

5100
05:20:06,729 --> 05:20:08,740
Why do I think I'm driving so erratically?

5101
05:20:09,299 --> 05:20:10,419
Worth a lot of fucking money.

5102
05:20:22,389 --> 05:20:23,590
Erotic driving?

5103
05:20:25,849 --> 05:20:27,450
No, erratic.

5104
05:20:27,450 --> 05:20:28,569
See, see, see, see.

5105
05:20:29,209 --> 05:20:30,709
How far back can I go?

5106
05:20:31,270 --> 05:20:41,349
I can't lose the Phoebe Herman bike.

5107
05:20:41,349 --> 05:20:41,990
I refuse.

5108
05:20:46,759 --> 05:20:48,119
I can see too much.

5109
05:20:48,119 --> 05:20:50,020
You know what I mean?

5110
05:20:50,020 --> 05:20:51,540
I feel like I can see way too much.

5111
05:20:52,180 --> 05:21:05,430
I want to ride this so bad.

5112
05:21:06,439 --> 05:21:09,560
All right, guys, tell me the truth.

5113
05:21:10,040 --> 05:21:13,240
I've got gas and I have gas and oil in here.

5114
05:21:13,799 --> 05:21:15,240
Can I ride this fucking bike?

5115
05:21:15,799 --> 05:21:20,619
If I put two wheels on this, fill it and then turn it on.

5116
05:21:20,619 --> 05:21:22,299
No, you need an engine for it.

5117
05:21:22,299 --> 05:21:22,939
What the hell?

5118
05:21:23,580 --> 05:21:25,700
Can I put my car engine on it?

5119
05:21:33,029 --> 05:21:35,060
No.

5120
05:21:35,060 --> 05:21:35,779
Yes.

5121
05:21:35,779 --> 05:21:38,139
It's not how that works.

5122
05:21:42,979 --> 05:21:44,020
I can though.

5123
05:21:45,939 --> 05:21:46,580
Why not?

5124
05:21:47,900 --> 05:21:48,380
Let's go.

5125
05:21:55,700 --> 05:21:56,099
Try it.

5126
05:21:57,130 --> 05:21:58,250
The next pit stop I will.

5127
05:22:08,220 --> 05:22:08,700
Wrong way.

5128
05:22:08,700 --> 05:22:09,659
No, the things are on the right.

5129
05:22:10,220 --> 05:22:27,819
I can't believe I'm still driving.

5130
05:22:27,819 --> 05:22:30,979
We've got the kid.

5131
05:22:31,939 --> 05:22:32,659
It's all right.

5132
05:22:32,659 --> 05:22:36,180
He'll put his thumb in the ear and some horror movie character will pick him up.

5133
05:22:36,180 --> 05:22:37,779
Oh, no, I'm out of control.

5134
05:22:46,580 --> 05:22:47,060
Bad view.

5135
05:22:53,880 --> 05:22:56,759
Look, okay, is he the main character or am I the main character?

5136
05:22:56,759 --> 05:22:59,479
It's really important because if he's the main character, he's going to be just fine.

5137
05:23:02,490 --> 05:23:05,529
An eagle will come pick him up for all that matters if he's the main character.

5138
05:23:13,979 --> 05:23:15,180
It's okay.

5139
05:23:15,740 --> 05:23:18,630
It's all right.

5140
05:23:18,630 --> 05:23:19,430
Just give me the...

5141
05:23:23,400 --> 05:23:25,159
This fucking bike is going to be the end.

5142
05:23:31,619 --> 05:23:34,099
I swear to God, I saw your character fly out the windshield.

5143
05:23:34,099 --> 05:23:34,659
Can you clip it?

5144
05:23:34,659 --> 05:23:35,139
Are you sure?

5145
05:23:35,700 --> 05:23:44,549
Did that actually happen?

5146
05:23:44,549 --> 05:23:57,979
Wait, you can put the car engine in it.

5147
05:23:57,979 --> 05:24:01,130
It's better be a one guy moment or I'm going to be very annoyed.

5148
05:24:29,459 --> 05:24:39,799
Give air.

5149
05:24:39,799 --> 05:24:41,799
Yes.

5150
05:24:41,799 --> 05:24:42,680
Save the game.

5151
05:24:42,680 --> 05:24:55,110
The moped runs on two stroke fuel as used in the Trabant with a cruising speed of approximately 50.

5152
05:24:55,110 --> 05:24:58,310
To start the moped, climb on by looking at the seat by pressing E.

5153
05:24:58,310 --> 05:24:59,509
Press I to switch the ignition.

5154
05:24:59,509 --> 05:25:03,430
Press space to lift the stick, hold W.

5155
05:25:03,430 --> 05:25:04,069
Okay.

5156
05:25:04,069 --> 05:25:12,979
So I need oil and gas in here.

5157
05:25:12,979 --> 05:25:14,020
Oil and gas in there.

5158
05:25:15,860 --> 05:25:17,939
Add oil and fuel.

5159
05:25:17,939 --> 05:25:20,330
Do we even have any oil though?

5160
05:25:20,330 --> 05:25:22,900
Might be in trouble here.

5161
05:25:22,900 --> 05:25:41,080
Okay.

5162
05:25:41,080 --> 05:25:44,419
Do I have oil?

5163
05:25:44,419 --> 05:25:54,630
I need oil.

5164
05:25:54,630 --> 05:25:56,790
That's water in there, isn't it?

5165
05:25:57,509 --> 05:25:58,470
Move this out of the way for a minute.

5166
05:25:58,470 --> 05:25:59,349
I need to look.

5167
05:25:59,349 --> 05:26:06,680
This water oil in the engine.

5168
05:26:07,720 --> 05:26:18,619
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

5169
05:26:18,619 --> 05:26:28,340
How much oil?

5170
05:26:28,340 --> 05:26:28,580
All right.

5171
05:26:28,580 --> 05:26:31,459
How much oil?

5172
05:26:31,459 --> 05:26:32,099
Four?

5173
05:26:32,099 --> 05:26:36,229
Four percent or three percent?

5174
05:26:36,229 --> 05:26:38,520
Three percent.

5175
05:26:38,520 --> 05:26:38,919
That's it.

5176
05:26:39,479 --> 05:26:40,200
Okay, good.

5177
05:26:40,200 --> 05:26:40,919
Now I'm going to...

5178
05:26:41,560 --> 05:26:42,040
Can I put...

5179
05:26:42,040 --> 05:26:42,840
All right, hold on.

5180
05:26:42,840 --> 05:26:46,650
Another massive amount of fucking subs just came in.

5181
05:26:46,650 --> 05:26:47,290
Holy shit.

5182
05:26:47,290 --> 05:26:49,689
Another 20 from the chef's corner.

5183
05:26:50,869 --> 05:26:51,909
Thank you, chef's corner.

5184
05:26:51,909 --> 05:27:02,220
That's a shitload of money.

5185
05:27:02,220 --> 05:27:02,939
All right.

5186
05:27:02,939 --> 05:27:03,900
Is that good?

5187
05:27:03,900 --> 05:27:23,580
This isn't doing anything.

5188
05:27:23,580 --> 05:27:24,380
It's no engine.

5189
05:27:25,020 --> 05:27:25,580
Fuck.

5190
05:27:29,770 --> 05:27:30,650
Look down.

5191
05:27:30,650 --> 05:27:32,009
I know there's no engine.

5192
05:27:32,009 --> 05:27:32,729
I know, I know.

5193
05:27:32,729 --> 05:27:35,419
Okay, but cap that, please.

5194
05:27:36,970 --> 05:27:37,689
Get back up.

5195
05:27:37,689 --> 05:27:38,250
Stand it up.

5196
05:27:41,049 --> 05:27:41,610
Okay.

5197
05:27:41,610 --> 05:27:47,779
Put the car engine in it.

5198
05:27:58,360 --> 05:27:59,000
Did that work?

5199
05:28:10,099 --> 05:28:10,900
Oh, fuck.

5200
05:28:10,900 --> 05:28:11,380
Easy.

5201
05:28:11,380 --> 05:28:12,180
Careful.

5202
05:28:12,180 --> 05:28:18,680
I'm going to put the kickstand up.

5203
05:28:18,680 --> 05:28:19,560
Oh my god.

5204
05:28:19,560 --> 05:28:19,959
Whatever.

5205
05:28:19,959 --> 05:28:20,680
Just...

5206
05:28:20,680 --> 05:28:29,540
Why is it such a pain in the ass?

5207
05:28:29,540 --> 05:28:31,700
I can't put the kickstand up while it's...

5208
05:28:44,939 --> 05:28:46,220
God.

5209
05:29:01,430 --> 05:29:11,290
You motherfucker.

5210
05:29:11,290 --> 05:29:11,610
All right.

5211
05:29:11,610 --> 05:29:12,330
It's ready.

5212
05:29:12,330 --> 05:29:14,659
It's ready, it's ready, it's ready.

5213
05:29:14,659 --> 05:29:25,939
Is it going?

5214
05:29:25,939 --> 05:29:33,580
It still doesn't work.

5215
05:29:34,139 --> 05:29:40,360
It's because I'm pedaling.

5216
05:29:40,360 --> 05:29:41,560
It's just a bicycle.

5217
05:29:42,119 --> 05:29:43,610
This isn't using any gas.

5218
05:29:44,409 --> 05:29:58,150
I'm the energy.

5219
05:29:58,150 --> 05:29:58,709
Old eye.

5220
05:29:58,709 --> 05:30:00,330
See you later, sucker.

5221
05:30:02,330 --> 05:30:06,729
It's so hard to control.

5222
05:30:07,930 --> 05:30:18,919
It's impossible to control.

5223
05:30:19,720 --> 05:30:20,759
Oh, the kickstand.

5224
05:30:20,759 --> 05:30:25,180
No, the kickstand.

5225
05:30:25,819 --> 05:30:27,259
Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off.

5226
05:30:27,259 --> 05:30:47,610
Is that another UFO?

5227
05:30:47,610 --> 05:30:51,770
Oh my fucking god damn it.

5228
05:30:51,770 --> 05:31:02,060
Why does this have to be like this?

5229
05:31:02,060 --> 05:31:23,700
Why does it have to do this?

5230
05:31:23,700 --> 05:31:25,139
Why can't I just sit it up?

5231
05:31:25,139 --> 05:31:25,860
Turn the kickstand on?

5232
05:31:25,860 --> 05:31:26,580
I can.

5233
05:31:26,580 --> 05:31:27,669
Wrong way.

5234
05:31:27,669 --> 05:31:28,869
Let's move.

5235
05:31:28,869 --> 05:31:29,909
Oh, really?

5236
05:31:29,909 --> 05:31:44,569
No, you can't.

5237
05:31:44,569 --> 05:31:55,479
Why is it two of us?

5238
05:31:55,479 --> 05:32:10,060
Why is it two of us?

5239
05:32:10,060 --> 05:32:13,659
Why is it two of us?

5240
05:32:13,659 --> 05:32:21,580
Why is it two of us?

5241
05:32:22,060 --> 05:32:23,180
Why is it two of me?

5242
05:32:23,180 --> 05:32:25,479
Is it two of me?

5243
05:32:26,040 --> 05:32:26,840
You see that?

5244
05:32:26,840 --> 05:32:28,819
Why is it two of us on the bike?

5245
05:32:28,819 --> 05:32:52,439
Is this shit out of gas?

5246
05:32:52,439 --> 05:32:54,119
Stop doing that with your hand, man.

5247
05:32:54,119 --> 05:32:59,080
What are you...

5248
05:32:59,080 --> 05:33:00,439
Stop doing that.

5249
05:33:01,080 --> 05:33:12,650
I don't know why he's doing that.

5250
05:33:12,650 --> 05:33:47,400
It's overheating.

5251
05:33:47,400 --> 05:33:48,520
Stop doing that.

5252
05:33:48,520 --> 05:33:57,860
Okay, you done?

5253
05:34:03,000 --> 05:34:03,720
There we go.

5254
05:34:03,720 --> 05:34:04,119
Thank you.

5255
05:34:10,779 --> 05:34:11,180
Stop.

5256
05:34:27,029 --> 05:34:28,389
There's no radiator.

5257
05:34:29,110 --> 05:34:31,110
But how do you get a radiator on here?

5258
05:34:31,990 --> 05:34:33,270
This is not how this works.

5259
05:34:51,139 --> 05:34:52,259
Make the gun talk?

5260
05:34:53,540 --> 05:34:53,939
No.

5261
05:34:53,939 --> 05:34:54,500
What?

5262
05:34:54,500 --> 05:34:58,180
Why did you tell me to shoot the engine?

5263
05:34:58,740 --> 05:35:00,330
Are you out of your mind?

5264
05:35:18,950 --> 05:35:20,150
This sucks.

5265
05:35:20,150 --> 05:35:28,919
If I just piss, will it go?

5266
05:35:29,639 --> 05:35:31,720
I think that kind of works.

5267
05:35:32,279 --> 05:35:46,619
No more piss.

5268
05:35:47,930 --> 05:35:48,810
Oh, no.

5269
05:35:48,810 --> 05:35:50,250
This can't be the end.

5270
05:35:50,250 --> 05:35:51,909
Time to walk?

5271
05:35:52,470 --> 05:35:54,389
This goes faster than walking.

5272
05:35:54,389 --> 05:35:57,779
I can't believe there's no radiator.

5273
05:35:58,419 --> 05:35:59,700
How was I supposed to know that?

5274
05:36:00,259 --> 05:36:02,900
Reload to the car?

5275
05:36:02,900 --> 05:36:03,779
No, no, nope.

5276
05:36:03,779 --> 05:36:04,180
I can't.

5277
05:36:04,819 --> 05:36:05,459
I'm just going.

5278
05:36:06,099 --> 05:36:09,130
Don't worry.

5279
05:36:09,130 --> 05:36:09,689
I'll be fine.

5280
05:36:10,250 --> 05:36:16,630
What's wrong with this guy?

5281
05:36:17,270 --> 05:36:25,189
What's wrong with his body?

5282
05:36:25,830 --> 05:36:26,310
What did I?

5283
05:36:26,310 --> 05:36:55,060
Why is he doing this right now?

5284
05:36:55,060 --> 05:36:56,419
I think that was probably part of the problem.

5285
05:36:56,419 --> 05:36:57,220
I'll be honest.

5286
05:36:57,220 --> 05:37:00,069
I think that's why that was happening.

5287
05:37:00,069 --> 05:37:04,419
I really do.

5288
05:37:04,419 --> 05:37:05,619
John Arbuckle.

5289
05:37:05,619 --> 05:37:11,750
I don't think it needs a radiator.

5290
05:37:11,750 --> 05:37:12,790
I think that's bullshit.

5291
05:37:12,790 --> 05:37:41,080
It has a hole in it.

5292
05:37:41,080 --> 05:37:45,740
It's got plenty of fuel.

5293
05:37:45,740 --> 05:37:46,459
See?

5294
05:37:46,459 --> 05:37:47,340
No.

5295
05:37:47,979 --> 05:37:51,419
At least I'm not stretching anymore.

5296
05:37:51,419 --> 05:37:59,639
Just pedal for a while.

5297
05:37:59,639 --> 05:38:03,540
Wait for it to cool off.

5298
05:38:03,540 --> 05:38:04,340
All right.

5299
05:38:04,340 --> 05:38:09,779
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

5300
05:38:09,779 --> 05:38:11,619
No, I wanted to kick-stand it up.

5301
05:38:11,619 --> 05:38:38,659
It's empty.

5302
05:38:38,659 --> 05:38:39,540
Shit, wait.

5303
05:38:45,369 --> 05:38:45,610
No.

5304
05:38:46,490 --> 05:38:47,770
I so blew it.

5305
05:38:48,330 --> 05:38:49,849
I thought I could pee on it.

5306
05:38:49,849 --> 05:38:51,110
It's okay.

5307
05:38:51,110 --> 05:38:52,229
There's still a little oil in there.

5308
05:39:00,169 --> 05:39:00,889
Whatever.

5309
05:39:00,889 --> 05:39:01,610
Reload.

5310
05:39:01,610 --> 05:39:03,049
Reload this shit.

5311
05:39:03,049 --> 05:39:03,770
Reload it.

5312
05:39:03,770 --> 05:39:04,330
Whatever.

5313
05:39:22,819 --> 05:39:23,139
Wait.

5314
05:39:23,139 --> 05:39:23,860
Radiator.

5315
05:39:23,860 --> 05:39:26,549
I got it.

5316
05:39:26,549 --> 05:39:55,240
3%.

5317
05:39:55,240 --> 05:40:03,619
Bingo.

5318
05:40:03,619 --> 05:40:04,180
Radiator.

5319
05:40:04,180 --> 05:40:04,900
Give it to me.

5320
05:40:04,900 --> 05:40:23,400
The engine with Mountain Dew.

5321
05:40:24,659 --> 05:40:25,619
Blast.

5322
05:40:25,619 --> 05:40:26,020
Okay.

5323
05:40:26,020 --> 05:40:26,659
Fuck this.

5324
05:40:26,659 --> 05:40:27,689
I'm done.

5325
05:40:27,689 --> 05:40:28,250
I'm done.

5326
05:40:28,250 --> 05:40:29,209
Get the fuck out of here.

5327
05:40:29,209 --> 05:40:30,090
I'm taking the car.

5328
05:40:33,159 --> 05:40:33,880
Put it all back.

5329
05:40:34,439 --> 05:40:35,319
You know what?

5330
05:40:35,319 --> 05:40:36,860
I don't need you anymore, bike.

5331
05:40:36,860 --> 05:40:37,740
Wait, is there oil in there?

5332
05:40:37,740 --> 05:40:38,619
I could use the gas.

5333
05:40:38,619 --> 05:40:47,610
At least I got to ride the bike once.

5334
05:40:47,610 --> 05:41:09,779
No.

5335
05:41:10,419 --> 05:41:20,139
Smashed my dick in the car door to death.

5336
05:41:22,330 --> 05:41:28,919
All right.

5337
05:41:28,919 --> 05:41:29,319
That's it.

5338
05:41:29,319 --> 05:41:30,459
I'm done.

5339
05:41:30,459 --> 05:41:31,099
That's it.

5340
05:41:31,099 --> 05:41:32,540
It's been about six hours.

5341
05:41:32,540 --> 05:41:33,259
I need to get some food.

5342
05:41:33,259 --> 05:41:36,069
I'm hungry and I need to get up.

5343
05:41:36,069 --> 05:41:42,580
Oh, yeah, yeah.

5344
05:41:42,580 --> 05:41:46,439
I will see you guys tomorrow.

5345
05:41:46,439 --> 05:41:47,159
Not on this stream.

5346
05:41:47,159 --> 05:41:48,759
I'll be on Kitboga's stream tomorrow.

5347
05:41:48,759 --> 05:41:51,909
This is a lot of fun, though.

5348
05:41:51,909 --> 05:41:58,009
Thanks for sticking around.

5349
05:41:58,009 --> 05:41:59,209
It was very, very good.

5350
05:42:02,970 --> 05:42:03,610
I...

5351
05:42:03,610 --> 05:42:04,650
Yeah, tomorrow...

5352
05:42:04,650 --> 05:42:05,290
I will...

5353
05:42:05,290 --> 05:42:05,529
You know what?

5354
05:42:05,529 --> 05:42:07,209
I'll probably send a tweet out or something.

5355
05:42:07,209 --> 05:42:14,250
I would assume.

5356
05:42:14,250 --> 05:42:20,580
Before I'm on the stream, I'll be like,

5357
05:42:20,580 --> 05:42:21,860
hey, I'm coming on.

5358
05:42:21,860 --> 05:42:23,700
Just so people don't have to wait around, maybe.

5359
05:42:23,700 --> 05:42:24,869
But it should be a lot of fun.

5360
05:42:24,869 --> 05:42:25,590
I'm looking forward to it.

5361
05:42:33,049 --> 05:42:33,770
New tweet?

5362
05:42:33,770 --> 05:42:40,299
That's right.

5363
05:42:40,299 --> 05:42:40,939
Raid, raid.

5364
05:42:40,939 --> 05:42:41,099
All right.

5365
05:42:41,099 --> 05:42:41,659
Who are we going to raid?

5366
05:42:44,069 --> 05:42:44,470
Who have we...

5367
05:42:44,470 --> 05:42:46,630
We need somebody we haven't raided.

5368
05:42:46,630 --> 05:42:48,580
I want a new raid.

5369
05:42:55,180 --> 05:42:56,380
Raid yourself.

5370
05:42:56,380 --> 05:43:05,380
Let's see.

5371
05:43:05,380 --> 05:43:06,340
Who's streaming right now?

5372
05:43:07,139 --> 05:43:16,459
Who's streaming that we have not raided in a long time?

5373
05:43:16,459 --> 05:43:19,419
You know who we have not raided in a while?

5374
05:43:19,979 --> 05:43:23,419
Who has shown this channel tons and tons of love over the years?

5375
05:43:24,459 --> 05:43:25,259
It's Boxbox.

5376
05:43:27,590 --> 05:43:29,990
Boxbox raids this channel all the time.

5377
05:43:29,990 --> 05:43:33,020
And they're awesome.

5378
05:43:33,020 --> 05:43:44,409
You're going to do House Flipper VR.

5379
05:43:44,409 --> 05:43:52,139
Let me...

5380
05:43:52,139 --> 05:43:53,819
Yeah, we raided Lemmy last week.

5381
05:43:53,819 --> 05:43:56,900
I want to try to do new raids

5382
05:43:56,900 --> 05:44:00,889
instead of raiding the same, like, four people every time.

5383
05:44:00,889 --> 05:44:01,209
Let's...

5384
05:44:01,209 --> 05:44:02,250
We got to branch out.

5385
05:44:02,250 --> 05:44:04,330
We got to raid other people.

5386
05:44:20,040 --> 05:44:20,520
Who's this?

5387
05:44:23,259 --> 05:44:24,139
Wait, Wayner?

5388
05:44:25,240 --> 05:44:25,720
Wayner?

5389
05:44:26,279 --> 05:44:27,479
All right, save that one for next time.

5390
05:44:28,500 --> 05:44:30,099
But I did already commit to Boxbox.

5391
05:44:30,500 --> 05:44:32,419
Go say hello.

5392
05:44:33,779 --> 05:44:34,659
They are awesome.

5393
05:44:35,220 --> 05:44:37,740
They're playing Team Fight Tactics.

5394
05:44:38,740 --> 05:44:39,860
Team Fight Tactics.

5395
05:44:40,419 --> 05:44:44,310
Apparently, it's a try-hard day for Boxbox.

5396
05:44:44,310 --> 05:44:48,180
Raid someone with, like, 10 viewers.

5397
05:44:48,180 --> 05:44:48,819
You know, I...

5398
05:44:48,819 --> 05:44:49,220
Okay.

5399
05:44:49,220 --> 05:44:50,259
Here's why I don't want to do that.

5400
05:44:50,259 --> 05:44:54,020
Because maybe if, like, they really want...

5401
05:44:54,020 --> 05:44:56,580
If you get, like, 10,000 people dumped on you,

5402
05:44:56,580 --> 05:45:00,259
it's like, okay, do I have...

5403
05:45:00,259 --> 05:45:01,220
Can people even hear me?

5404
05:45:01,220 --> 05:45:02,900
Is my mic on?

5405
05:45:02,900 --> 05:45:04,020
That's a heart attack, yeah.

5406
05:45:04,020 --> 05:45:08,439
I'd rather, like, warn somebody that that was going to happen.

5407
05:45:08,439 --> 05:45:09,000
7K.

5408
05:45:09,000 --> 05:45:11,959
Well, there was 10 earlier.

5409
05:45:11,959 --> 05:45:20,889
Raid quick before everybody leaves.

5410
05:45:20,889 --> 05:45:24,540
Oh, we got to do the credits, though.

5411
05:45:24,540 --> 05:45:26,700
Actually, there was a shitload of people here today.

5412
05:45:26,700 --> 05:45:27,819
Much more than usual, show.

5413
05:45:28,380 --> 05:45:30,860
Apparently, I'm having trouble talking.

5414
05:45:30,860 --> 05:45:32,500
I need to get some protein.

5415
05:45:33,540 --> 05:45:35,139
Yeah, I mean, this game is really fun.

5416
05:45:37,189 --> 05:45:39,509
Did I get a clean 100 kilometers?

5417
05:45:39,509 --> 05:45:42,520
I don't have...

5418
05:45:42,520 --> 05:45:44,040
I don't have to open this game ever again.

5419
05:45:44,040 --> 05:45:50,229
Holy shit.

5420
05:45:50,950 --> 05:45:52,360
All right, let's do the credits.

5421
05:45:52,360 --> 05:45:53,159
Thanks for watching, guys.

5422
05:45:53,159 --> 05:45:54,200
I'll see you guys on...

5423
05:45:54,200 --> 05:45:54,919
I don't know.

5424
05:45:54,919 --> 05:45:57,110
Tomorrow, I'll be on Kitboga.

5425
05:45:57,110 --> 05:46:00,840
And then maybe Saturday or Monday?

5426
05:46:00,840 --> 05:46:01,880
We'll see how it goes.

5427
05:46:01,880 --> 05:46:03,639
Keep an eye on the sus over the next couple of days.

5428
05:46:03,639 --> 05:46:06,040
Let's do the credits, though.

5429
05:46:06,040 --> 05:46:12,729
Here they go.

5430
05:46:12,729 --> 05:46:16,919
Load them up in alphabetical order.

5431
05:46:16,919 --> 05:46:19,299
These are all the subs today.

5432
05:46:19,299 --> 05:46:20,979
For those of you that don't know,

5433
05:46:20,979 --> 05:46:24,549
if you're new to the channel, you might be.

5434
05:46:24,549 --> 05:46:31,130
I do not read subs or most bit messages, really, at all during the stream.

5435
05:46:31,130 --> 05:46:34,150
I used to do all the bits at the end of a stream,

5436
05:46:34,150 --> 05:46:36,919
but since I had some medical problems recently,

5437
05:46:36,919 --> 05:46:40,279
I've canned that indefinitely and probably permanently.

5438
05:46:40,279 --> 05:46:45,290
So a six-hour stream is a six-hour stream.

5439
05:46:45,369 --> 05:46:48,009
A six-hour stream does not turn into a six-hour stream,

5440
05:46:48,009 --> 05:47:00,700
and then an hour and a half post stream, if I need to get up.

5441
05:47:00,700 --> 05:47:01,819
I do appreciate it, nonetheless.

5442
05:47:01,819 --> 05:47:03,180
This channel gets a ton of support,

5443
05:47:03,180 --> 05:47:06,819
and I still can't believe this many people care.

5444
05:47:06,819 --> 05:47:08,419
Seeing the amount of names that just pop up, it's...

5445
05:47:10,409 --> 05:47:12,009
It can be overwhelming sometimes.

5446
05:47:12,009 --> 05:47:15,049
So thanks a lot, everybody.

5447
05:47:15,049 --> 05:47:17,900
Don't change your raid commit.

5448
05:47:17,900 --> 05:47:18,380
No, I...

5449
05:47:18,380 --> 05:47:19,659
We're raiding box box.

5450
05:47:29,369 --> 05:47:29,689
Birthday?

5451
05:47:29,689 --> 05:47:30,810
Well, we'll say happy birthday.

5452
05:47:30,810 --> 05:47:32,250
Just say happy birthday to the...

5453
05:47:32,250 --> 05:47:33,610
Like, next week when we raid them.

5454
05:47:33,610 --> 05:47:40,919
You can do a belated happy birthday for a week later.

5455
05:47:40,919 --> 05:47:44,619
Within seven days, a belated birthday,

5456
05:47:45,430 --> 05:47:45,909
that's a happy...

5457
05:47:45,909 --> 05:47:57,180
That works.

5458
05:47:57,180 --> 05:47:59,819
That's a terrible friend.

5459
05:47:59,819 --> 05:48:02,619
Look, you can't keep track of every single person's birthday.

5460
05:48:02,619 --> 05:48:06,709
So what ends up happening is one of your friends will have a birthday,

5461
05:48:06,709 --> 05:48:07,270
and you'll go,

5462
05:48:07,909 --> 05:48:08,869
Oh, yeah, that's right.

5463
05:48:08,869 --> 05:48:09,430
I knew it was...

5464
05:48:09,430 --> 05:48:11,349
I knew it was in September, but...

5465
05:48:11,349 --> 05:48:11,909
No, it's all right.

5466
05:48:11,909 --> 05:48:13,110
It's been like four or five days.

5467
05:48:13,110 --> 05:48:13,830
It's okay.

5468
05:48:13,830 --> 05:48:17,340
Okay, now if like November rolls around and somebody said,

5469
05:48:17,340 --> 05:48:18,779
Hey, happy birthday, Jeremy.

5470
05:48:19,340 --> 05:48:21,580
I'd be like, all right, what the fuck are you doing?

5471
05:48:21,580 --> 05:48:23,020
It's unnecessary, man.

5472
05:48:23,020 --> 05:48:28,540
You might as well just say Merry Christmas, too, at that point.

5473
05:48:28,540 --> 05:48:43,000
Boxbox has a follower-only mode for 30 minutes.

5474
05:48:43,000 --> 05:48:43,639
That's perfect.

5475
05:48:49,139 --> 05:48:50,259
Here comes the rain!

5476
05:48:58,360 --> 05:49:00,709
That's kind of funny.

5477
05:49:00,709 --> 05:49:01,349
I committed...

5478
05:49:01,349 --> 05:49:01,750
I...

5479
05:49:01,750 --> 05:49:03,590
Look, you can't be like, let's raid this person,

5480
05:49:03,590 --> 05:49:04,950
and then like 10 minutes later be like,

5481
05:49:04,950 --> 05:49:05,669
Just kidding.

5482
05:49:05,669 --> 05:49:06,389
Fuck that.

5483
05:49:06,389 --> 05:49:08,549
No, you make a commitment, you do it.

5484
05:49:08,549 --> 05:49:15,779
I'll see you guys on...

5485
05:49:17,049 --> 05:49:18,259
Maybe Saturday?

5486
05:49:18,259 --> 05:49:19,220
Maybe Monday?

5487
05:49:19,220 --> 05:49:19,700
Saturday?

5488
05:49:19,700 --> 05:49:20,020
Sunday?

5489
05:49:20,020 --> 05:49:20,340
I don't know.

5490
05:49:20,340 --> 05:49:22,069
You'll see.

5491
05:49:22,069 --> 05:49:23,479
Thanks for watching.

5492
05:49:23,479 --> 05:49:28,150
Take care and go say hello to Boxbox on our behalf.

5493
05:49:28,150 --> 05:49:29,959
Like it.
