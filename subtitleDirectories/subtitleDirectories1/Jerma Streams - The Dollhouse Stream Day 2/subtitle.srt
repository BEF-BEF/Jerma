1
00:00:44,789 --> 00:11:47,110
These? These are my subgirls.

2
00:11:47,110 --> 00:12:02,980
Hey! Whoa!

3
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Dama!

4
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
No te batalo!

5
00:12:06,980 --> 00:13:00,490
Look at Andrew.

6
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,500
That's right. Look at Andrew. Never heard of him.

7
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:50,409
I'm going to see my armpits, so I'll lift my arms up.

8
00:13:50,409 --> 00:15:29,740
My subgirls.

9
00:15:29,740 --> 00:16:51,370
Woo!

10
00:16:51,370 --> 00:19:58,680
Yep!

11
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:29,339
Yep!

12
00:20:29,339 --> 00:21:54,200
Can't breathe without these.

13
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Look at the TikTok video. Who said the lip I was doing?

14
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,410
I was just going...

15
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:32,970
Woo!

16
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,970
Just a little too big.

17
00:22:34,970 --> 00:24:53,849
Can't breathe without these.

18
00:24:53,849 --> 00:26:18,460
Look at the TikTok video. Who said the lip I was doing?

19
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
I was just going...

20
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:33,690
Woo!

21
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:58,200
Just a little too big.

22
00:26:58,200 --> 00:29:17,210
Can't breathe without these.

23
00:29:17,210 --> 00:32:54,339
I broke the watch.

24
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,339
We should have started like five minutes ago.

25
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,650
We had to tape the watch on my hand.

26
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,140
I was putting it on, I was panicking.

27
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
And the thing just shattered in my hands.

28
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,019
But anyways, hi!

29
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,019
Welcome to day two of the Dollhouse.

30
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,019
Do you need an introduction?

31
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:12,019
Should I give you an introduction?

32
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,019
Or do you already know how this works?

33
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:16,019
You should by now.

34
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,019
Why don't we go take a look inside? Oh my god! I look fucking awful!

35
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:20,019
I was just like...

36
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,019
Oh god.

37
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,019
I'm going to be so self-conscious.

38
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:26,019
I don't wear this shit.

39
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:28,019
In my own home I don't wear this.

40
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,019
Because I'm embarrassed about my neck and shoulders and stomach come out.

41
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:32,019
And I think you can see my nipples through the shirt.

42
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,019
But I'm going to try to do my best to make sure you can't see that.

43
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,019
Let's go in the house.

44
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,259
Seas have been cleaned up.

45
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:43,940
You notice something in the trash out there?

46
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Because I'm not sleeping on that fucking mattress.

47
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,940
That's not going to happen.

48
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
I'm not sleeping on that.

49
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
Because it's actually dirty.

50
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Actually dirty.

51
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,250
Actually, you know, I look like a...

52
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,680
Oh boy!

53
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,980
I look like a fucking idiot.

54
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,630
You know the bathroom?

55
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,259
Probably pretty well at this point, I would assume.

56
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,559
I love this bathroom.

57
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,559
Although I could use a little bit more stuff.

58
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,559
Please be aware.

59
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,559
You are in control of...

60
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,559
98% of everything that happens on this stream.

61
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:21,079
Just be aware of that.

62
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,699
Should we check this door?

63
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,260
What do you think? Should I go in here?

64
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,820
Does this door work?

65
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:34,900
We'll find out. I can't open it.

66
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,940
It's locked.

67
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Oh, that's where the bed is.

68
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
That's right. I built it.

69
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
It was broken.

70
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,269
But that's where I decided to put it.

71
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:51,269
Because you got it for me at the end of the stream.

72
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:53,269
It took me like six hours to build it.

73
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:57,539
This is nice and comfy.

74
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,039
Can somebody...

75
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:06,219
I actually kind of like how this looks.

76
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:09,159
Can we see?

77
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,159
Can you get it?

78
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,159
Can I like home shopping network this thing?

79
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:15,849
It's so stupid.

80
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,789
I feel like that mouse

81
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,789
who I'm not going to say

82
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,789
on a stream like this

83
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,789
I feel like that mouse wears this kind of stuff.

84
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,789
I feel like he has like 30 of these.

85
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:28,789
But we never see him wear it.

86
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,610
I guarantee he has it.

87
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,610
Welcome back though.

88
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,610
You know, from the front it looks okay.

89
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,610
But from the side it doesn't.

90
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,170
I need to like get a bigger chest.

91
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,789
But I got like these flick of these arms.

92
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:44,789
I can go like that.

93
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,349
I love the bedroom.

94
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:49,849
You've got more choices now, don't you?

95
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,590
Toilet, I don't have to go.

96
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,590
But just so you can be aware

97
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,590
that it is available.

98
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,590
Eventually I probably want to take these gloves off.

99
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,219
Enjoy the game.

100
00:36:09,219 --> 00:36:11,849
Good luck.

101
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:13,849
I got full bars, which means I can do this.

102
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:20,570
That's embarrassing. I just did that.

103
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,159
How many people here?

104
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,159
That was actually pretty embarrassing to do with this many people.

105
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,159
73,000 people just watched me do that.

106
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,159
That's like embarrassing.

107
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,159
Back in like during like school plays

108
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,159
there'd be like fucking 40 people in the audience.

109
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:55,429
They're...

110
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,429
No, I'm not peeing on them.

111
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,429
I'm not peeing on the flowers.

112
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:01,860
Why is that the piss sound?

113
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
That's not water flowers.

114
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,090
I'm going to stand like this

115
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,090
so people don't think that's what's happening.

116
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,090
I enjoyed that very much though.

117
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,090
I did.

118
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,969
I'll tell you, from the front this looks good.

119
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:20,420
Wait a minute.

120
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
We're going to do the same job from the other day.

121
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,800
I still got it.

122
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,000
But what I was going to say is

123
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,500
back when I was a young, young boy

124
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
there'd be

125
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
school plays, you know.

126
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
You're in like the fourth grade, the fifth grade.

127
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Only people's parents

128
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
came to that shit, right?

129
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Maybe the principal, maybe the old lady

130
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
that played the piano during the entire show.

131
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
She would just

132
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
every scene it would be like

133
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
that lady was like super into it.

134
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
I kind of wish we had one of those ladies.

135
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
We don't.

136
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
But the difference is

137
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
it's not 40 people's parents.

138
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,739
It's 70,000 people.

139
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,980
I don't know how many of you are.

140
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,710
Actually, I think my mother is watching.

141
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,710
I'm going to go lie in the bed.

142
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,510
I'm going to go check the bed out.

143
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,159
Parasocial Andy.

144
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:26,840
What? I'm going to check the bed out.

145
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,730
Okay.

146
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,900
There it is. There's the first one.

147
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:45,059
Okay.

148
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,059
I actually talked about the fart thing.

149
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:49,059
And I said five farts.

150
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:51,059
An hour. An hour.

151
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,059
So it's going to be in a lot of trouble.

152
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:55,059
It was five fart sounds an hour.

153
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:58,070
There was one.

154
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,070
I want you to keep track.

155
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:13,880
Okay, let's go.

156
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:21,110
I watch out for that manhole.

157
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:35,449
You see the mattress?

158
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:40,500
There it is.

159
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,510
I'm in the right clothes for this.

160
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,650
Not sleeping on this.

161
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,019
We actually talked about this after day one.

162
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,019
I'm like

163
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:53,449
not a chance that I actually lie on this.

164
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:56,969
No way.

165
00:39:56,969 --> 00:40:05,219
Oh, we got the popcorn maker.

166
00:40:05,219 --> 00:40:08,409
Except it doesn't do anything.

167
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:26,900
Because I don't want to get electrocuted.

168
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:33,050
Check mail. Sure.

169
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:40,579
Why not? Mail.

170
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:50,760
Check the mail. What's in the mail today?

171
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,719
Let's find out.

172
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,219
This is somebody's shoe that's here.

173
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:02,219
Somebody actually like on set here.

174
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,219
This is their shoe.

175
00:41:04,219 --> 00:41:06,219
I don't know whose it is, but I don't know why it's in here.

176
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:15,800
What is it?

177
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,550
Has somebody worn this in the last few days?

178
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:24,500
Did I just get money?

179
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,730
There's 20 bucks in the shoe.

180
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,730
Who would do this?

181
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,030
What kind of fucked up neighborhood is this?

182
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Thanks for the 20 dollars.

183
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,309
What do we start with? 300?

184
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:44,869
So that's what? 320?

185
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:50,170
How much money? 40? What?

186
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:52,170
I thought we started with 300 dollars.

187
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,780
Oh, they bought the upgraded house.

188
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,780
Right. But why don't we have any money?

189
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,019
How are we supposed to get any money?

190
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,019
How are they going to buy anything?

191
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,369
I'm talking to you.

192
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:09,369
Remember, I have to go to work to make money.

193
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:16,789
If you don't send me to work, then it's not going to happen.

194
00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:22,019
Oh! Got you.

195
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:25,670
I actually hit myself in the head.

196
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,670
I went for like a joke.

197
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,670
And I didn't fucking get it right.

198
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,510
My knee was in the wrong place.

199
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,510
That actually just hit me right in the forehead.

200
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:42,630
I do actually feel pretty... I need to take a shower.

201
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:49,219
Let me get in here.

202
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:55,300
Don't close that. See, you guys figured it out.

203
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,500
You got to keep these bars green.

204
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,500
Otherwise, how am I going to get promoted?

205
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
How are you going to make more money?

206
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,019
How are you going to be able to get more stuff in the house?

207
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,019
You can't unless you actually play

208
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,710
and get me there.

209
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:18,199
I want green bars.

210
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:33,289
Coming up. Coming up.

211
00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:35,289
Oh, I hit the watch.

212
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:37,289
I'm getting a little tired though.

213
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,170
I'm starting to wane a little.

214
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,820
I want cool items.

215
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,820
I want fun stuff.

216
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,820
I want things to lie down on.

217
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,820
I don't just want...

218
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,440
What was that?

219
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Go to work. I missed work by like

220
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,809
four hours already.

221
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,940
Go to work?

222
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,500
Alright, I'm going to work.

223
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Fine. I'm going to work.

224
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:17,369
I'm coming.

225
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:42,900
Night shift.

226
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,179
Thanks for the ride. Goodbye.

227
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:56,820
Goodbye. Goodbye.

228
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,820
That just made me tired.

229
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,320
That just brought

230
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
my energy to zero.

231
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,610
What did I do?

232
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,610
It wasn't working for like six or seven

233
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,610
hours. It was doing the goodbye

234
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:13,610
like five times

235
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,360
is what made me tired.

236
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,610
I'm exhausted though.

237
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:27,670
Tired and a little hungry.

238
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,300
At least we made some money. I'm hungry though.

239
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
And how much money is in the account now?

240
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,300
$200? $140?

241
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,860
I'm going to my

242
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
bedroom. I haven't been able to sit in here for very long.

243
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,860
I've got a bathroom that's bigger than the bedroom

244
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,860
which is a little odd.

245
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,710
I don't want to lock

246
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,710
myself out of one of these rooms eventually.

247
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:56,469
Oh man.

248
00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:03,579
Tired. Make a phone call.

249
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:07,849
Who am I calling?

250
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,849
Call who?

251
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:12,340
Who am I calling?

252
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,539
I got a call?

253
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,849
No sleeping?

254
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,849
What are you talking about?

255
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:28,599
Oh!

256
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:36,340
Mom!

257
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,400
Yeah, it's me.

258
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,900
Yeah. Yeah, it's been an interesting day

259
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,519
or two. It's

260
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,519
actually really remarkable that I can even talk to you, Mom,

261
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,519
considering that I just pulled the line out of the wall.

262
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,519
So this is really good.

263
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,519
Some kind of alien technology which is interesting.

264
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,949
Oh yeah, no, hi. Hello, sorry.

265
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:56,949
I forgot to say like hi. How are you?

266
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,130
Yeah, it's good to hear your voice.

267
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,130
You're the only person I know.

268
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:03,130
That's kind of interesting.

269
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,199
Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:47:06,199 --> 00:53:53,219
And so I...

271
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:55,780
What? Oh, this.

272
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,599
Right. Right. This. This shit.

273
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:09,420
That's right.

274
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:21,610
Okay. Okay.

275
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,610
The couch is fucking ugly.

276
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,389
Mom?

277
00:54:28,389 --> 00:54:32,170
Are you still on the phone? Mom?

278
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,170
I don't know. I hope she thinks I'm alright.

279
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,539
Let me put this back.

280
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,699
What is... What is this?

281
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:44,070
Can I get this back on?

282
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:46,570
Yeah, whatever. It'll stay.

283
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,869
Oh. Ooh, yes!

284
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,369
Oh, I love that! Oh, sofa!

285
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:53,369
Ew!

286
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,369
Yuck! Yuck!

287
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:11,219
What is this?

288
00:55:11,219 --> 00:55:15,510
I don't want that.

289
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:24,659
I want one piece of singular bread.

290
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:26,659
I feel awful. I hate sleeping on the ground.

291
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:29,099
Let me go to bed, alright?

292
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,099
Like, okay, there's a sofa here now.

293
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:33,099
There's a bed in the other room.

294
00:55:33,099 --> 00:55:35,099
Don't make me use the phone.

295
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:37,099
If my energy's low and I'm just...

296
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,099
I'm hangry, alright?

297
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,099
Just let me talk to you for a second.

298
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,099
If you put me in the bed and let me go to sleep,

299
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:45,099
then this won't happen. You'll have plenty of opportunity

300
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:47,099
I'm gonna piss my shit my pants.

301
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:55,159
I'm just eating a piece of bread.

302
00:55:55,159 --> 00:56:02,710
I'm eating one piece of bread.

303
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:06,679
It's good. It's actually pretty good.

304
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:09,110
This is the good bread.

305
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,119
What kind of bread is this?

306
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,679
Oh, it's multigrain.

307
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,679
I eat multigrain bread.

308
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:18,679
I don't. I actually think that stuff's gross.

309
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:24,949
Okay, that was good.

310
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:30,440
Delicious.

311
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Don't just leave it.

312
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,650
Disgusting.

313
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:44,280
I'm gonna do a thing that everybody does.

314
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,519
What? Work?

315
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:55,610
I'm gonna go to work?

316
00:56:55,610 --> 00:57:01,219
Wait! Wait for me!

317
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:39,940
Wait for me!

318
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,940
Just a full piece of white bread.

319
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,460
I've been at work all day trying to eat.

320
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,460
I've been chewing

321
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,460
this single piece of white bread for fucking

322
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,340
six hours.

323
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:58,170
It's like eating saltines.

324
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,409
Everybody at work thought I was chewing gum.

325
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:02,409
I ate a whole piece of white bread before I came in.

326
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:05,800
They were like,

327
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,800
dude, what did you have for breakfast today?

328
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,800
I just went like this

329
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
with a piece of white bread.

330
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,800
They were like, do you want to go to McDonald's?

331
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:20,139
I'm like, I don't know. No!

332
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:23,400
I'm fucking horrible.

333
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:35,289
I feel awful.

334
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,980
I can see it.

335
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,559
I can see it!

336
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:48,599
Please help me.

337
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:51,030
Please help me.

338
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,030
Please, I can see it.

339
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,030
I can literally see the fucking toilet

340
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:59,000
in front of me.

341
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,570
What was that? What was that?

342
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:05,510
Wait, wait, wait.

343
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:10,820
Who's at the door?

344
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,960
This is my pants.

345
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:18,119
I'm coming!

346
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,750
Uncle Ted!

347
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,750
It's been so long!

348
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,440
What is he doing here?

349
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,440
I went to spring training.

350
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,440
I told your mother I was going.

351
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Look at this nice couch you got here.

352
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,440
You got good taste.

353
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,809
He's dead.

354
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,809
What are you doing here?

355
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:42,809
Give me a hug.

356
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:44,809
He's so fucking cold.

357
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,809
He's freezing.

358
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:48,809
What's the matter with you?

359
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:50,809
Let's go.

360
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:52,809
I went to my house.

361
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:54,809
I went to my house.

362
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:56,809
You know what's there? Nothing.

363
00:59:56,809 --> 00:59:59,110
I got no furniture.

364
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:01,110
That looks familiar.

365
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,110
I don't know what God I angered.

366
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:05,110
Oh, you like my couch?

367
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,110
That's beautiful.

368
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,110
I haven't had a beer in about

369
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,110
50...

370
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:13,929
Hey!

371
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:15,929
Uncle Ted!

372
01:00:15,929 --> 01:00:17,929
Uncle Ted!

373
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,929
There's a fucking ghost in my house.

374
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:21,929
This motherfucker is dead.

375
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,230
Jeremy!

376
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,230
Is that the bathroom?

377
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,409
You and the bathroom.

378
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,409
I need to do something about this.

379
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,409
He has to pass on.

380
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:37,030
The ghost of the walking dead.

381
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,030
Take your time.

382
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,210
I know what a good release feels like.

383
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,210
Sometimes it takes a little while.

384
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,449
Lord.

385
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:47,449
Start at 100.

386
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:49,449
I don't know what happened.

387
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:51,449
I don't know what God I angered.

388
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,449
I don't know what I did.

389
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,449
I don't know who I'm angering.

390
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:57,449
Get him to the other side.

391
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:59,449
That would be fantastic.

392
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:01,449
I don't want to be haunted anymore.

393
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,449
I want to pass on wealth.

394
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:05,940
Those are my spoons.

395
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,940
That looks like my couch.

396
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:14,219
I'm going to shit my pants.

397
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:17,860
I got that one.

398
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,130
I got that one in Dollywood.

399
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,369
Hey!

400
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,369
I love my grandson.

401
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:28,179
Hey, so how are you?

402
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:30,179
Are you ready for Uncle Ted?

403
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:32,179
You're not supposed to be here, Ted.

404
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:34,179
I'm not supposed to be here.

405
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:36,179
I had to get your address off somebody

406
01:01:36,179 --> 01:01:38,179
because your mother, freaking mother,

407
01:01:38,179 --> 01:01:40,179
my sister, my house is empty of furniture.

408
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:42,179
But this looks familiar, that looks familiar.

409
01:01:42,179 --> 01:01:44,179
And those are my spoons.

410
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:46,179
I got that one in Dollywood.

411
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:48,179
I've got a ghost that needs to go to the other god damn side.

412
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:52,179
He's haunting me.

413
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:54,179
Yeah, you come as soon as you can.

414
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:56,179
Talk to me.

415
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,179
Ted, Ted, how are you?

416
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:00,179
Who's on the phone?

417
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:02,179
I was just calling my friend, Granit Reapelson.

418
01:02:02,179 --> 01:02:04,179
Granit Reapelson?

419
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:06,179
Yeah, they're an old family friend.

420
01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:08,179
You played soccer with him, didn't you?

421
01:02:08,179 --> 01:02:10,179
I went to one of your games and you played soccer with him.

422
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,179
I did, I did.

423
01:02:12,179 --> 01:02:14,179
Anything that you need to say before you move on to the other world?

424
01:02:14,179 --> 01:02:16,179
No, I'm good.

425
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:18,179
There's no money hidden under any mattresses?

426
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:20,179
No, actually I had no money.

427
01:02:20,179 --> 01:02:22,179
Like somebody cleaned out my account when I was in spring training.

428
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:24,179
I went down to see this octagon.

429
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:26,179
Let me get the door.

430
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:28,179
Just stay there for a minute.

431
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:30,179
You know this is a new place but you've done wonders with it.

432
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:32,179
Stay there for just a second.

433
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:34,179
I'm here for Ted.

434
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:36,179
Please come in.

435
01:02:36,179 --> 01:02:40,019
Where does this go?

436
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,780
Yeah, he's over here.

437
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,780
He's having some trouble getting over to the other side if you could.

438
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,780
Hi, how are you?

439
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,780
This is my friend.

440
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,780
By the way, I don't think I've ever said about you.

441
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,780
It was just a joke.

442
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,780
If there's anything you need to say to me,

443
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,780
should I know anything about anything?

444
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,780
Dress up?

445
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,780
Is this dress up?

446
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,780
Ted.

447
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,780
It's time for you to come home, Ted.

448
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,780
It's time.

449
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,780
Well, there's no furniture in my home.

450
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,780
No, Ted, not that kind of home.

451
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,780
It's time for the long farewell.

452
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,780
It's time for the long farewell, Ted.

453
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,460
I'm feeling kind of cold.

454
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,460
Shh.

455
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,460
No more tears.

456
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,460
Only dreams.

457
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,460
Come on.

458
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,460
Come on now. Here we go.

459
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,460
There you are. That's right.

460
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,460
I'm not dead.

461
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,460
You're not dead, yes. They all say that, Ted.

462
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,460
They all say that.

463
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,460
Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.

464
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,460
Jerma can't help you now, Ted.

465
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,460
Fucking family.

466
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,460
I have a spot picked out for you right here.

467
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,460
Come on, Ted.

468
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,460
Right this way. There you go.

469
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,829
Shh.

470
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:51,829
I'm going to take good care of you, Ted.

471
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,829
Off we go now.

472
01:03:53,829 --> 01:04:00,659
Aww.

473
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:04,250
This is the worst day I've ever felt in my whole life.

474
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,250
What did he fucking do?

475
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,739
Why did he come here?

476
01:04:08,739 --> 01:04:10,739
Fucking haunted by my Uncle Ted.

477
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:12,739
I tried to make amends and shit.

478
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:17,219
I don't even know.

479
01:04:17,219 --> 01:04:25,929
I have to go to the bathroom.

480
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:46,010
Here, press it.

481
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:04,489
Jesus.

482
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:07,300
Holy goodness.

483
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,059
It's a whole nother one.

484
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:15,690
Okay.

485
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,690
The water's starting to come up over the lip.

486
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:36,300
I don't care.

487
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,300
You know when you have to pee a lot and it just hurts still.

488
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,300
It hurts.

489
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,300
Up here hurts.

490
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,300
Right here hurts.

491
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,300
All the way like I'm in here. This is killing me.

492
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,300
Oh, like I emptied everything, but it's just like this pain now.

493
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,300
Are you going to let that go again?

494
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:57,909
Thank you so much.

495
01:05:57,909 --> 01:05:59,909
Thank you so much.

496
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:01,909
And I'm going to say a prayer for Ted too

497
01:06:01,909 --> 01:06:03,909
because being haunted by somebody is just

498
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,909
a very unnerving ass thing.

499
01:06:05,909 --> 01:06:14,150
Oh, man.

500
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:16,460
I'm going to write about that in my blog tomorrow.

501
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,019
What should I title it?

502
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:24,840
My Uncle Going Through the Great Beyond.

503
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,840
Something like that.

504
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,960
Oh, I was fucked up.

505
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,329
What did I ever do to that motherfucker?

506
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:34,329
I didn't do anything.

507
01:06:34,329 --> 01:06:36,329
I got money in the mail from him. That's it.

508
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:39,719
It was just kind of the thing.

509
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,719
It was something my mother called me and sold me.

510
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:44,539
What the fuck?

511
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:46,539
I don't know why I'm getting haunted by him.

512
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:48,539
Thank God he's on the way to the other side.

513
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:53,579
That's ten times better.

514
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,579
That's a hundred times better.

515
01:06:55,579 --> 01:07:16,500
I'm not even fun anymore.

516
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,010
This is a nice watch though.

517
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,150
I don't want the clowns to come back.

518
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,150
Please do something. I don't want the clowns

519
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,099
to come back today.

520
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:35,130
Oh, yay!

521
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:43,690
Butterflies, but

522
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,690
they don't want to be caught. They want to be free.

523
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:48,760
Butterflies don't want to be caught.

524
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:54,780
They want to be free outside.

525
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:05,190
No, I don't want to. Let me see.

526
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,190
There's one over here.

527
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:16,539
Oh, that's a monarch.

528
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,539
It's beautiful. That's beautiful.

529
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:21,100
I think that might be a moth, but it's okay.

530
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,909
I can hear.

531
01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:27,909
It sounds like I'm getting hit by a wave.

532
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:29,909
It's like, hold on.

533
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,909
That's kind of funny.

534
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:33,909
That's funny I can hear that.

535
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:41,909
I can't move around too much.

536
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,819
This microphone life fucks up.

537
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:49,779
I'm tired though.

538
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:51,779
What's that butterfly?

539
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,779
I think that's a green-tailed

540
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:55,779
sparrow back. Wow!

541
01:08:55,779 --> 01:08:58,279
Maybe I should keep him.

542
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:01,670
Actual psycho?

543
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,260
I'm fucking tired.

544
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,260
Doorbell!

545
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,750
I didn't press it.

546
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:17,989
That was fun.

547
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:26,119
I feel better.

548
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:28,119
That's two. We have 30 minutes

549
01:09:28,119 --> 01:09:38,489
or 45 minutes to go before we can do three more.

550
01:09:38,489 --> 01:09:43,779
Life and death.

551
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,960
When somebody comes into the world,

552
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,260
they're essentially created.

553
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:50,260
And when they're taken away from the world,

554
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,079
they are destroyed.

555
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:55,079
So therefore, all of us at some point during our lives

556
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:57,079
witness creation

557
01:09:57,079 --> 01:09:59,380
and destruction

558
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,289
in one life. That's crazy to think about that.

559
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:06,229
And also like in the fact that

560
01:10:06,229 --> 01:10:08,229
are we even real?

561
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:10,229
Is this a simulation?

562
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:12,789
Like this is a simulation.

563
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:14,789
But is this a simulation

564
01:10:14,789 --> 01:10:16,789
inside of a simulation?

565
01:10:16,789 --> 01:10:19,479
Could we in fact wake up from this simulation

566
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:21,479
into another simulation?

567
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:24,170
Because we're doing it now!

568
01:10:30,810 --> 01:17:41,579
Oh. Have I eaten?

569
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:45,399
What was the last time I ate? I don't know.

570
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:50,439
Fuck it. I'm not ready.

571
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:54,010
Gas?

572
01:17:54,010 --> 01:18:00,149
Oh, I'm hungry as shit.

573
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,250
This is not a bad couch. Where did I get this from?

574
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:10,329
Oh, that's right.

575
01:18:10,329 --> 01:18:15,189
Cool. Okay.

576
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:17,560
Oh. This isn't really good.

577
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Unbranded beer.

578
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:32,600
I'm hungry. I feel like I've got like

579
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,600
a stomach ache too. I don't know why. When was the last time I ate?

580
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:55,579
Ugh.

581
01:18:55,579 --> 01:18:57,579
Ooh.

582
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,579
What is it? Mystery?

583
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:02,199
Mystery box?

584
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,770
Ow. A mystery?

585
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,770
Please handle with care. Do not drop.

586
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,100
Something fragile in here?

587
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,380
Well, if it's fragile,

588
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,140
I don't want to mess with it.

589
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,140
This is pretty cool though.

590
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:22,310
I would assume my fucking meter is high!

591
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:27,819
These fucking stools.

592
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:37,399
Is there anything else in here?

593
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:39,399
There's a lot of paper in here.

594
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,399
But they're...

595
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:44,859
Oh, this is a lot.

596
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,859
You know, can I say something

597
01:19:46,859 --> 01:19:48,859
real quick?

598
01:19:48,859 --> 01:19:51,289
The amount of packing

599
01:19:51,289 --> 01:19:53,289
material that people put into

600
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,289
boxes is getting a little

601
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:57,289
ridiculous, okay? I have

602
01:19:57,289 --> 01:19:59,289
ordered CDs before

603
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:01,289
that have come in a box this big

604
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:03,289
that have this much

605
01:20:03,289 --> 01:20:05,289
packing material and then what

606
01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:07,289
am I as the consumer to do about it?

607
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:12,789
You can literally like throw a fucking

608
01:20:12,789 --> 01:20:14,789
CD into the wall and it's gonna be fine.

609
01:20:14,789 --> 01:20:16,789
You don't have to put like 600

610
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:18,789
fucking pounds of paper in here!

611
01:20:18,789 --> 01:20:31,640
Hold on.

612
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,210
Ah! Stool!

613
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:56,460
I'll take some cereal. That sounds

614
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:04,649
good to me. I'm not

615
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:12,069
cutting a tomato.

616
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:14,069
It's me pouring a

617
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,819
soda.

618
01:21:16,819 --> 01:21:18,819
Oh, it's liquid cereal!

619
01:21:18,819 --> 01:21:21,699
Do I have any utensils?

620
01:21:21,699 --> 01:21:24,140
Oh, I'm starving though.

621
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:33,670
Thank goodness.

622
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:37,260
What was that? I have a good

623
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:39,689
thing I've eaten. Eat real quick!

624
01:21:39,689 --> 01:22:02,010
Hello? What?

625
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:08,329
Uncle Ted is dead. And I got

626
01:22:08,329 --> 01:22:12,300
an inheritance from Uncle Ted.

627
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:15,500
The insurance company? What?

628
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
Didn't Uncle Ted die like three days ago?

629
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:22,340
Two days ago? What do you mean?

630
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,180
My mother called me and said,

631
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,180
I got $2,000 added to my account.

632
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:31,449
But I thought that, I thought,

633
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:33,449
is this like just litigation stuff? Like I got it

634
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,449
like a week, two, three weeks later or something?

635
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:38,520
No, he's confirmed dead

636
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:44,069
yesterday. Oh.

637
01:22:44,069 --> 01:22:46,569
Okay. Interesting.

638
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:48,569
Thank you for the, thank you for the reply and

639
01:22:48,569 --> 01:22:53,819
thanks for the email.

640
01:22:53,819 --> 01:22:56,380
What? $2,000? Smack-a-roos

641
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:00,149
though! I'll take that one!

642
01:23:00,149 --> 01:23:02,149
Is he dead? What? I thought he died.

643
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:05,350
Oh, thank you!

644
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:09,960
Oh, thank you!

645
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:17,899
The cereal's actually pretty good.

646
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:19,899
Those who don't know, I don't eat on set.

647
01:23:19,899 --> 01:23:30,140
This is the only food that they give me.

648
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,140
Okay, can I sell this watch?

649
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:39,500
I don't want to leave trash around.

650
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:51,060
That's better. I need to put a trash

651
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,060
barrel, put a trash can in there.

652
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:55,430
Why are the people just at my house?

653
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,060
Stop coming to my house!

654
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,060
I haven't even eaten breakfast!

655
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:03,380
Oh my god, alright.

656
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:13,100
Who is that? Hi.

657
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,100
I'm Edna, by the way,

658
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,640
your neighbor. What are you doing here?

659
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,640
You'll have to forgive me, I

660
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,640
was busy with my cat sweater

661
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,640
yesterday, but this is for you.

662
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,640
Thank you. Welcome to the neighborhood.

663
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,640
Thank you. Welcome

664
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,640
to the neighborhood. Let's see the house.

665
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,819
Oh my.

666
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,819
Goodbye.

667
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:37,819
Oh wow, you've really done nothing

668
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:39,819
with the place. Okay.

669
01:24:39,819 --> 01:24:41,819
Is this what

670
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:43,819
you kids call a house these

671
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:45,819
days?

672
01:24:45,819 --> 01:24:47,819
Thank you.

673
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:49,819
I'll take that back later, but

674
01:24:49,819 --> 01:24:51,819
you put that wherever you like.

675
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:53,819
That's for you. There are apples, there's

676
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:55,819
fresh fruit in here. Yes, that's

677
01:24:55,819 --> 01:24:57,819
from the farmer's market. It's a stone

678
01:24:57,819 --> 01:24:59,819
throw away. If you ever get

679
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:01,819
hungry, you can go down there.

680
01:25:01,819 --> 01:25:03,819
There's no worms.

681
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:05,819
The worms, it's a very big mix up.

682
01:25:05,819 --> 01:25:07,819
My cat is the one with worms.

683
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:09,819
There are no worms in the apples.

684
01:25:09,819 --> 01:25:11,819
I can't have any of these. No, those

685
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:13,819
are for you. Those are for you. But you're taking

686
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:15,819
the basket. Yes, it's my basket.

687
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:17,819
Actually, my

688
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:19,819
first grandchild was born

689
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:21,819
and we brought it home in that basket.

690
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,819
Okay, that's really

691
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,819
fantastic. What would you say your name was again?

692
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,819
Edna. What is

693
01:25:27,819 --> 01:25:29,819
this?

694
01:25:29,819 --> 01:25:31,819
The placement's a little odd,

695
01:25:31,819 --> 01:25:33,819
but you can sit down if you want to. In your

696
01:25:33,819 --> 01:25:35,819
kitchen. I just

697
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:37,819
moved in and it was really nice to see

698
01:25:37,819 --> 01:25:39,819
you though. Have you seen

699
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:41,819
these spoons? Yes, I have

700
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:43,819
seen those spoons. My Uncle Ted left me those spoons.

701
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:45,819
Did they come with the house? Your Uncle who?

702
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:47,819
My Uncle Ted left me those

703
01:25:47,819 --> 01:25:49,819
spoons. You wet the bed? Okay.

704
01:25:49,819 --> 01:25:51,819
It was really nice. That happens sometimes.

705
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,819
People wet the bed. It's perfectly

706
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:55,819
normal. Don't worry about that.

707
01:25:55,819 --> 01:25:57,819
Yeah, sometimes

708
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,819
they do. They're under the age of six.

709
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:01,819
I'm a 35 year old man. How

710
01:26:01,819 --> 01:26:03,819
old are you?

711
01:26:03,819 --> 01:26:05,819
I'm 35. 35, really?

712
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:07,819
Okay, you look more like a 15

713
01:26:07,819 --> 01:26:09,819
with those gloves, but that's

714
01:26:09,819 --> 01:26:11,819
alright.

715
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:13,819
Do you mind if I sit down? Please do, please.

716
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,619
No, no, no.

717
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:23,619
Oh my.

718
01:26:23,619 --> 01:26:25,619
I just have a bad migraine.

719
01:26:25,619 --> 01:26:27,619
I'm okay. I want to say

720
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:30,439
you look lovely.

721
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:32,439
Thank you, sweetheart. I do my own

722
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:34,439
makeup and my own hair. You look lovely.

723
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,439
You're the loveliest woman I think I've ever seen in my life.

724
01:26:36,439 --> 01:26:38,439
Oh, really? Well, sweetheart, I'm sorry,

725
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:40,439
but I'm taken.

726
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:42,439
I'm taken. I've been married for 45

727
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:44,439
years. Yeah, that's

728
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:46,439
excellent. Do you have

729
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:48,439
a stool

730
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:50,439
by chance for me to put my feet up?

731
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:52,439
No, not yet.

732
01:26:52,439 --> 01:26:54,439
It's kind of an interesting scenario that I have

733
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:56,439
here in this particular house. No

734
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:58,439
stools? No, I mean you could put feet up there

735
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:00,439
if you want. It's too high.

736
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:02,439
The blood flow. It's too

737
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:04,439
high. Yeah.

738
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:06,439
How old are you?

739
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:08,439
You shouldn't ask a lady that question.

740
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:10,439
You should never ask.

741
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:12,439
That's probably a bad idea.

742
01:27:12,439 --> 01:27:15,000
Ruined it.

743
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Do you have food? I do.

744
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I actually do have food. Do you have bread?

745
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I've got lots of bread.

746
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Do you like bread?

747
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Not really, no. I don't like bread,

748
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
but a house isn't really a home

749
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,369
without food.

750
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:31,369
I've got bread.

751
01:27:31,369 --> 01:27:33,369
I do live like a 20-year-old

752
01:27:33,369 --> 01:27:35,369
that's in a dorm room, but I have

753
01:27:35,369 --> 01:27:37,369
peanut butter, I have cereal, I have mac and cheese,

754
01:27:37,369 --> 01:27:39,369
I've got bread. Oh, sweetheart.

755
01:27:39,369 --> 01:27:41,369
Why don't we whip something up really quick?

756
01:27:41,369 --> 01:27:43,369
Maybe in a few days or something.

757
01:27:43,369 --> 01:27:45,369
No, no, no, right now.

758
01:27:45,369 --> 01:27:47,369
Why don't you give me a beard doll?

759
01:27:47,369 --> 01:27:49,369
I've got some stuff going on, but I'm not sure.

760
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:51,369
I'm sorry, that might

761
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:53,369
be me. It's you.

762
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:55,369
Don't worry about that.

763
01:27:55,369 --> 01:27:57,369
I have a lot of nice people

764
01:27:57,369 --> 01:27:59,609
who call me.

765
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:01,609
I can get some food

766
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,300
ready if you want. I've got peanut butter,

767
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,789
you know, I've got everything.

768
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:09,420
Hello, this is Edna.

769
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,550
Yes. My social

770
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:14,550
security number, okay.

771
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,109
I can give that to you

772
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:19,109
if you want. That's fine.

773
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:21,109
What are you doing?

774
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:23,109
My social security number is

775
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:25,109
4-2-0-6-9.

776
01:28:25,109 --> 01:28:27,109
Is that a family member?

777
01:28:27,109 --> 01:28:29,109
My family wants to talk to you.

778
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:31,109
Is that a family member?

779
01:28:31,109 --> 01:28:33,109
He's from the social security department.

780
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:35,109
He's from the social security department?

781
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:37,109
Yeah, yeah.

782
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:40,250
Are you a family member?

783
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,250
Did he hang up on you? They hung up.

784
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,250
He'll call back. He's a real sweetheart.

785
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:46,250
Was that like a son or grandson?

786
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,250
No, there's a little bit of a mix-up.

787
01:28:48,250 --> 01:28:50,250
I left my car on the

788
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:52,250
south border of Texas, but it's a whole

789
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:54,250
thing. Don't worry about it.

790
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,250
I wouldn't give

791
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,250
your social security number to people you don't know.

792
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,250
Listen, will you be a sweetheart

793
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,250
and get me some flour and sugar and eggs

794
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,250
and some mayonnaise and maybe an avocado

795
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:06,250
and a couple of, I don't know,

796
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,250
do you have like a baking sheet

797
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:10,250
or maybe a pie tin?

798
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,250
I don't think I have any of those things.

799
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,250
You don't have any of those things?

800
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,250
You can take a look.

801
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,250
Just to make yourself comfortable and maybe

802
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:20,250
we could plan this maybe in a few days, but not right now.

803
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:22,250
Oh no, I'm busy in a few days.

804
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,689
Okay.

805
01:29:27,689 --> 01:29:29,689
There's not much here, but...

806
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:31,689
What am I doing?

807
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:34,819
What, he only eats macaroni?

808
01:29:34,819 --> 01:29:38,859
Is that you

809
01:29:38,859 --> 01:29:40,859
or me? I don't know.

810
01:29:40,859 --> 01:29:42,859
It sounds like you. I think it's me again.

811
01:29:42,859 --> 01:29:44,859
I need to make a phone call.

812
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:46,859
Are you getting another call? How many calls do you get?

813
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:48,859
It's me. Well, I'm a very busy woman

814
01:29:48,859 --> 01:29:51,350
now, right?

815
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,350
I would change your phone number.

816
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:56,039
Hello? Yes.

817
01:29:56,039 --> 01:29:58,039
I was telling you the social security

818
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:00,039
number, right? Yeah.

819
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:02,039
It's, um, I'm sorry, what was that?

820
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:04,470
Where is my grandson?

821
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:07,420
Your grandson?

822
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,420
He's in prison.

823
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,420
I'm quite busy right now.

824
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,420
Maybe some leg routines, something like that.

825
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:15,420
He's in prison?

826
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,420
Yeah, whatever you'd cost, it doesn't matter.

827
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:19,420
Because it's not me paying for it, except it is just bullshit.

828
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,420
How long has he been in prison for?

829
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,420
Yeah, you have my address.

830
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:25,420
It came up on the thing. What do you need from me?

831
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,420
It's 9-8-5. 9-8-5.

832
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,420
Dollhouse way.

833
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:31,590
Is everything okay?

834
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,770
Excellent. We'll see you soon.

835
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:35,770
Well, how much money is it exactly?

836
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,770
How much money would you need

837
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:39,770
for me? Okay, so $10,000

838
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,770
and he gets out of prison.

839
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,770
Scott, three or so? Hang the phone up.

840
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,770
Hold on, it's two seconds, two seconds.

841
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:47,770
Okay, my wire details.

842
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,770
If I could give those, it's a Wells Fargo

843
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:51,770
or a Chase or whatever.

844
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:54,140
Hello!

845
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:57,659
It's time to get

846
01:30:57,659 --> 01:30:59,659
fit.

847
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:01,659
I think so. Those look heavy.

848
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:03,659
Come on in. Get in there and get physical.

849
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:05,659
Come on in.

850
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:07,829
Okay, I was

851
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:09,829
looking about maybe some upper bodies.

852
01:31:09,829 --> 01:31:11,829
Well, I can tell you

853
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:13,829
how we're going to get you in shape.

854
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:15,829
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

855
01:31:15,829 --> 01:31:17,829
I'll have to call you back.

856
01:31:17,829 --> 01:31:19,829
There's a strange man

857
01:31:19,829 --> 01:31:21,829
in the house.

858
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:23,829
Don't take any more phone calls.

859
01:31:23,829 --> 01:31:25,829
Yes, they are. Hold on a second.

860
01:31:25,829 --> 01:31:27,829
Don't take any more phone calls.

861
01:31:27,829 --> 01:31:29,829
You never know.

862
01:31:29,829 --> 01:31:31,829
Well, I would get your phone number, go to

863
01:31:31,829 --> 01:31:33,829
the provider and they talk to them about that.

864
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:35,829
I think you probably shouldn't be answering those calls.

865
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:37,829
What's your name? Gigi.

866
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:39,829
This is Gigi.

867
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:41,829
Nice to meet you.

868
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,829
So what do we want to do?

869
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:45,829
So what we're going to do, some light aerobic exercise.

870
01:31:45,829 --> 01:31:47,829
Get the heart rate elevated.

871
01:31:47,829 --> 01:31:49,829
You can sit down.

872
01:31:49,829 --> 01:31:51,829
I think I'll sit down for this one.

873
01:31:51,829 --> 01:31:53,829
I want you to follow me.

874
01:31:53,829 --> 01:31:55,829
First one,

875
01:31:55,829 --> 01:31:57,829
the sprinkler.

876
01:31:57,829 --> 01:31:59,829
Okay.

877
01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:01,829
Hey.

878
01:32:01,829 --> 01:32:03,829
Hey.

879
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:05,829
That kind of hurts.

880
01:32:05,829 --> 01:32:07,829
More movement, more energy. Come on.

881
01:32:07,829 --> 01:32:09,829
But it hurts. Okay, we'll do a different one.

882
01:32:09,829 --> 01:32:11,829
I can do this at home.

883
01:32:11,829 --> 01:32:13,829
We're picking items at the supermarket.

884
01:32:13,829 --> 01:32:15,829
We're picking items.

885
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:17,829
Come on, get that arm up.

886
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:19,829
That's right, we're picking items at the supermarket.

887
01:32:19,829 --> 01:32:21,829
We're swimming in the pool.

888
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:23,829
We're swimming in the pool.

889
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:25,829
I can actually feel it in my pecs.

890
01:32:25,829 --> 01:32:27,829
Are you feeling strong?

891
01:32:27,829 --> 01:32:29,829
Do you feel good?

892
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:31,829
I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.

893
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:33,829
I don't want to be responsible if something happens to you.

894
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:35,829
Just relax.

895
01:32:35,829 --> 01:32:37,829
How do you feel?

896
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:39,829
I'm lightening up a little bit.

897
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:41,829
Now it's time for the skyscraper.

898
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:43,829
How much weight are these?

899
01:32:43,829 --> 01:32:45,829
Those are five pounds each.

900
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:47,829
You don't want to hurt yourself.

901
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:49,829
We're yummy mummies looking to be tight in the tummy.

902
01:32:51,829 --> 01:32:53,829
You got it.

903
01:32:53,829 --> 01:32:55,829
You might need a spar, but you're looking good.

904
01:32:55,829 --> 01:32:57,829
I wanted to drop those off as a welcoming gift for you.

905
01:32:57,829 --> 01:32:59,829
I wanted to drop those off as a welcoming gift for you.

906
01:32:59,829 --> 01:33:01,829
You look great.

907
01:33:01,829 --> 01:33:03,829
I actually feel pretty good.

908
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:05,829
You ever want to go out for a 60 mile run?

909
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:07,829
You'll never get that from Uncle.

910
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:09,829
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

911
01:33:09,829 --> 01:33:11,829
Are you going to leave these here?

912
01:33:11,829 --> 01:33:13,829
Would you like them?

913
01:33:13,829 --> 01:33:15,829
I would love these.

914
01:33:15,829 --> 01:33:17,829
How much was that?

915
01:33:17,829 --> 01:33:19,829
Do you need a credit card?

916
01:33:19,829 --> 01:33:21,829
No, that's okay.

917
01:33:21,829 --> 01:33:23,829
We're coming back for a workout tomorrow.

918
01:33:23,829 --> 01:33:25,829
I'll see myself out.

919
01:33:27,829 --> 01:33:29,829
Bye.

920
01:33:29,829 --> 01:33:31,829
That was a very strong workout.

921
01:33:31,829 --> 01:33:33,829
That cost $200.

922
01:33:35,829 --> 01:33:38,260
What was your name again?

923
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,260
My name is Gerber.

924
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,260
Do you have children?

925
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:44,260
I don't have kids.

926
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,949
Why don't you have children?

927
01:33:46,949 --> 01:33:48,949
It just didn't work out.

928
01:33:48,949 --> 01:33:50,949
I've been trying to focus on my career.

929
01:33:50,949 --> 01:33:52,949
What's that? You have a job?

930
01:33:52,949 --> 01:33:54,949
Your kids don't have jobs these days.

931
01:33:54,949 --> 01:33:56,949
You go to work regularly?

932
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:58,949
I don't get in a car to go to work.

933
01:33:58,949 --> 01:34:00,949
I go in front of a screen.

934
01:34:00,949 --> 01:34:02,949
Very interesting.

935
01:34:02,949 --> 01:34:04,949
What was that?

936
01:34:04,949 --> 01:34:06,949
I get in front of a screen.

937
01:34:06,949 --> 01:34:08,949
It's almost like a car.

938
01:34:08,949 --> 01:34:10,949
What does that mean?

939
01:34:10,949 --> 01:34:12,949
It sounds like you made up a job.

940
01:34:12,949 --> 01:34:14,949
I get in front of a computer.

941
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:16,949
I hang out with people.

942
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:18,949
We chat and we're cool.

943
01:34:18,949 --> 01:34:20,949
You don't have to make up a job to appease me.

944
01:34:20,949 --> 01:34:22,949
I still care about you.

945
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,949
I'm a plumber.

946
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:26,949
The trades are very beautiful.

947
01:34:26,949 --> 01:34:28,949
That's very difficult.

948
01:34:28,949 --> 01:34:30,949
That's exactly what people need.

949
01:34:30,949 --> 01:34:32,949
Plumbing, I go into the sinks.

950
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:36,949
I'd like you to really quickly,

951
01:34:36,949 --> 01:34:38,949
if you don't mind,

952
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:40,949
could you point me to your bathroom?

953
01:34:40,949 --> 01:34:42,949
The bathroom is right under the storage room.

954
01:34:42,949 --> 01:34:44,949
I have a weak bladder.

955
01:34:44,949 --> 01:34:46,949
So do I, but apparently they don't want to take care of it.

956
01:34:46,949 --> 01:34:48,949
That's not bad in your hands.

957
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:50,949
All right.

958
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:52,949
She was talking about getting flour.

959
01:34:52,949 --> 01:34:54,949
Flour, a whole package of eggs,

960
01:34:54,949 --> 01:34:56,949
avocado,

961
01:34:56,949 --> 01:34:58,949
if you have anything like noodles,

962
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:00,949
salami,

963
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:02,949
anything like that.

964
01:35:02,949 --> 01:35:06,729
Excuse me.

965
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:14,199
Oh my.

966
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:16,199
Look, he's just like Jimmy Fallon.

967
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:18,199
He just breaks it every time.

968
01:35:18,199 --> 01:35:22,859
Oh, stool.

969
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:24,859
Okay.

970
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:26,859
I need to get the flour ready.

971
01:35:26,859 --> 01:35:29,859
Edna.

972
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:32,039
I need to.

973
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:34,039
I need to get flour.

974
01:35:34,039 --> 01:35:40,380
Oh.

975
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,380
Okay.

976
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,869
Easy does it.

977
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:46,869
I'm a little titty pie.

978
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:50,869
Edna, are you in there?

979
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:52,869
What was that?

980
01:35:52,869 --> 01:35:54,869
Would you like to dance, Edna?

981
01:35:54,869 --> 01:35:56,869
It's a weird request, but would you like to dance?

982
01:35:56,869 --> 01:35:58,869
Okay, hold on.

983
01:35:58,869 --> 01:36:00,869
Edna, come on.

984
01:36:00,869 --> 01:36:02,869
Come on out here. Do you like to dance?

985
01:36:02,869 --> 01:36:09,779
Would you like to dance?

986
01:36:09,779 --> 01:36:11,779
Would you love to dance?

987
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:13,779
Okay, let's go ahead and do this.

988
01:36:13,779 --> 01:36:15,779
Okay, I don't know what that means.

989
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:17,779
All right.

990
01:36:17,779 --> 01:36:23,609
My throat was a little weird.

991
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:25,609
You remind me of my husband when he was younger.

992
01:36:25,609 --> 01:36:27,609
Before he passed away.

993
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:31,319
Yeah, we turn.

994
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:36,949
Now you spin me around.

995
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:38,949
Just like, thank you.

996
01:36:38,949 --> 01:36:40,949
We lock it in our locket fingers.

997
01:36:40,949 --> 01:36:43,770
Why are we dancing for?

998
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:45,770
Because I'm very tired.

999
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:56,409
Let go.

1000
01:36:56,409 --> 01:36:58,409
Okay.

1001
01:36:58,409 --> 01:37:00,579
Into the kitchen, if you would.

1002
01:37:00,579 --> 01:37:02,579
Into the kitchen.

1003
01:37:02,579 --> 01:37:11,539
Are you coming in here?

1004
01:37:11,539 --> 01:37:13,539
I'm coming in here.

1005
01:37:13,539 --> 01:37:15,539
Listen, I'm a firm believer

1006
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:17,539
that a house isn't a home without cookies.

1007
01:37:17,539 --> 01:37:19,539
Yeah.

1008
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:21,539
Can I give you

1009
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:23,539
my mother's famous recipe for cookies?

1010
01:37:23,539 --> 01:37:25,539
Edna, did you wash your hands?

1011
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,539
I never wash my hands.

1012
01:37:27,539 --> 01:37:29,539
You kids don't understand. I have a very good immune system.

1013
01:37:29,539 --> 01:37:31,539
Very good.

1014
01:37:31,539 --> 01:37:34,939
Okay.

1015
01:37:34,939 --> 01:37:36,939
No, that's okay.

1016
01:37:36,939 --> 01:37:38,939
If we're going to make food, then you should...

1017
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:40,939
You'll do all the work, sweetie.

1018
01:37:40,939 --> 01:37:42,939
It's all in the feeling. You have to feel this.

1019
01:37:42,939 --> 01:37:44,939
So what do you need?

1020
01:37:44,939 --> 01:37:46,939
Flour, sugar, eggs.

1021
01:37:46,939 --> 01:37:48,939
What are we making? Cookies.

1022
01:37:48,939 --> 01:37:50,939
What kind of cookies?

1023
01:37:50,939 --> 01:37:52,939
Sugar, eggs, water.

1024
01:37:52,939 --> 01:37:54,939
What kind of eggs are these?

1025
01:37:54,939 --> 01:37:56,939
Those are free-range eggs.

1026
01:37:56,939 --> 01:37:58,939
What does free-range mean?

1027
01:38:00,939 --> 01:38:02,939
I don't know. I just pretend to know.

1028
01:38:02,939 --> 01:38:04,939
So I just pretend to know.

1029
01:38:04,939 --> 01:38:06,939
I think that means the chickens are going to walk around.

1030
01:38:06,939 --> 01:38:08,939
Okay, we'll need all of these.

1031
01:38:08,939 --> 01:38:10,939
Is that all right?

1032
01:38:10,939 --> 01:38:12,939
All of them? At least most of them, yeah.

1033
01:38:12,939 --> 01:38:14,939
We can use a few of them.

1034
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:16,939
How much sugar do we put?

1035
01:38:16,939 --> 01:38:18,939
Honey, just embrace it.

1036
01:38:18,939 --> 01:38:20,939
Sprinkle it all in there.

1037
01:38:20,939 --> 01:38:22,939
This is to make cookie dough?

1038
01:38:22,939 --> 01:38:24,939
Yes, go ahead. Just give it a couple of good shakes.

1039
01:38:24,939 --> 01:38:26,939
Put it all in there.

1040
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:28,939
All the flour?

1041
01:38:28,939 --> 01:38:30,939
Well, I mean most of it.

1042
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:32,939
That's good.

1043
01:38:32,939 --> 01:38:34,939
A little more.

1044
01:38:34,939 --> 01:38:36,939
A little bit more.

1045
01:38:36,939 --> 01:38:38,939
Eyeball it. Does that seem good?

1046
01:38:38,939 --> 01:38:40,939
I've never made cookies in my entire life.

1047
01:38:40,939 --> 01:38:42,939
You've never made cookies?

1048
01:38:42,939 --> 01:38:44,939
That looks great.

1049
01:38:44,939 --> 01:38:46,939
You want to wiggle it around a little.

1050
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:48,939
See if there's any lumps in there.

1051
01:38:48,939 --> 01:38:50,939
Okay, now dump all the sugar in it.

1052
01:38:50,939 --> 01:38:52,939
People like sugar.

1053
01:38:52,939 --> 01:38:56,140
I like sugar. It's good.

1054
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,140
And this is just how my mother used to make these.

1055
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,140
They're very simple.

1056
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on.

1057
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,140
It's kind of hard to open.

1058
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
I don't know why you kids do things like that.

1059
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,140
It's just like...

1060
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,140
Where did you get these spoons, by the way?

1061
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:12,140
Those were left by my uncle Ted.

1062
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
Okay.

1063
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:16,140
Who recently passed away.

1064
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,140
Can I have them?

1065
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:20,140
Can I have those spoons?

1066
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,140
Can you have them?

1067
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,140
You don't use them, right?

1068
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,140
They were left from my uncle Ted,

1069
01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,140
who recently passed away.

1070
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,140
You need help with that?

1071
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:32,140
I'm just going to open the top

1072
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,140
because I have these Mickey Mouse gloves on.

1073
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,140
Somebody decided I was going to wear them the entire day.

1074
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,140
You're your own person.

1075
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,140
You get to make your own choices.

1076
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,140
How much sugar goes in here?

1077
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:46,869
The whole thing goes right in there.

1078
01:39:46,869 --> 01:39:48,869
That's perfect.

1079
01:39:48,869 --> 01:39:50,869
That looks good.

1080
01:39:50,869 --> 01:39:52,869
What I want you to do

1081
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:54,869
is crack two or three eggs into that pitcher.

1082
01:39:54,869 --> 01:39:56,869
Two or three of them?

1083
01:39:56,869 --> 01:39:58,869
Two or three.

1084
01:39:58,869 --> 01:40:00,869
Whatever you're feeling today,

1085
01:40:00,869 --> 01:40:02,869
do you want to be extra moist cookies?

1086
01:40:02,869 --> 01:40:04,869
Is there a recipe or are you just doing this?

1087
01:40:04,869 --> 01:40:06,869
It's all in your heart, honey.

1088
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:08,869
I don't know what that means.

1089
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:10,869
How many eggs do you think would be best?

1090
01:40:10,869 --> 01:40:12,869
If you're always on a quiz show

1091
01:40:12,869 --> 01:40:14,869
and you tell me how many eggs,

1092
01:40:14,869 --> 01:40:16,869
I would say probably four.

1093
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:18,869
That's terrible. We'll make it again.

1094
01:40:18,869 --> 01:40:21,300
That's fine.

1095
01:40:24,819 --> 01:40:26,819
You've got to do better than that.

1096
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,020
We've made a good decision here.

1097
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,020
These gloves are coming off.

1098
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:39,350
How about two?

1099
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:41,350
I think it'll be great.

1100
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:43,350
Even one egg is perfect.

1101
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:45,350
Back in the war, when I was younger,

1102
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:47,350
we used to have to ration

1103
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:49,350
and we could make one egg go a long way.

1104
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:51,350
You know what? In the gift basket,

1105
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:53,350
I brought over some applesauce.

1106
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,350
Applesauce?

1107
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:57,350
This is applesauce.

1108
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,350
These are mint chocolates.

1109
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:01,350
If you boil them up,

1110
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:03,350
it'll be a similar consistency.

1111
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:05,350
We'll roll with it.

1112
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,350
Okay, so boil these?

1113
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:09,350
No, forget it.

1114
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:11,350
You don't want them in?

1115
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:13,350
You're fine.

1116
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:15,350
I need a stirrer.

1117
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:17,350
Do you have water?

1118
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:19,350
Take a little bit of water.

1119
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:21,350
I get a picture here.

1120
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:23,350
What is this going to make, Edna?

1121
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,350
They used to say two spoons of sugar

1122
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:27,350
would make the medicine go down.

1123
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,350
In this case, you have a whole box.

1124
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:31,350
It'll taste very good.

1125
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:33,350
That smell you're smelling, by the way,

1126
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,350
is probably the eggs and the sugar combined.

1127
01:41:35,350 --> 01:41:37,350
It's probably filling the room.

1128
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:39,350
I can't smell anything.

1129
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:41,350
Thank God.

1130
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:43,850
How much water?

1131
01:41:43,850 --> 01:41:45,850
That'll do.

1132
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,850
Do I mix this?

1133
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:49,850
What kind of cookies?

1134
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:51,850
Put your arms back into it.

1135
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,850
Uh-huh.

1136
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:56,020
Really work.

1137
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,020
I want to see you actually working.

1138
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,020
It's good for you kids to work.

1139
01:42:00,020 --> 01:42:02,020
Yeah, it is.

1140
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,020
Elbow grease, we used to call it.

1141
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:06,020
This is sugar flour and egg.

1142
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:08,020
Pecan sandies.

1143
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:10,020
My mother's recipe.

1144
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,020
Those are my least favorite cookie in the world.

1145
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:14,020
Why would you say that?

1146
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:16,020
It tastes like you're taking a bite of the beach on the ground

1147
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,020
and it's sandy.

1148
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,020
So you don't want extra pecans?

1149
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:22,020
When I take a bite of a pecan sandy,

1150
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,020
I feel like there's sand in my underwear from the beach.

1151
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:26,020
You don't like that?

1152
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:28,020
I don't hate them.

1153
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:30,020
I thought that's why some people went to the beach.

1154
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,479
I've got it all wrong, I guess.

1155
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:35,979
Okay.

1156
01:42:35,979 --> 01:42:38,789
Are you really tired after this?

1157
01:42:38,789 --> 01:42:40,789
I mean, it's work, Edna.

1158
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:42,789
Look at this. Look at how much muscle I'm putting into this.

1159
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:44,789
You kids don't understand.

1160
01:42:44,789 --> 01:42:46,789
All right, that's good.

1161
01:42:46,789 --> 01:42:48,789
Can we see? Is that good?

1162
01:42:48,789 --> 01:42:50,789
Do you mind for two seconds?

1163
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:52,789
I have to make a quick phone call if you don't mind.

1164
01:42:52,789 --> 01:42:54,789
No, fine.

1165
01:42:54,789 --> 01:42:56,789
Put it in the oven.

1166
01:42:56,789 --> 01:42:58,789
That's an oven-proof bowl.

1167
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:00,789
Okay.

1168
01:43:00,789 --> 01:43:02,789
Edna, this is plastic.

1169
01:43:02,789 --> 01:43:05,220
Can I actually use your phone?

1170
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:07,220
Before you go in there, I need to take a shower real quick.

1171
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,220
Oh.

1172
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,220
You can get on the phone.

1173
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:13,220
I'm going to call somebody this way.

1174
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,220
I'm going to take a quick shower.

1175
01:43:15,220 --> 01:43:17,220
Okay.

1176
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:19,979
All right, you're fine.

1177
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:21,979
Let me get these in the oven.

1178
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:23,979
Is it going to be pecan sandies?

1179
01:43:23,979 --> 01:43:25,979
Yeah, put it in there for like 20 minutes.

1180
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:27,979
Okay, so 20 minutes.

1181
01:43:27,979 --> 01:43:29,979
Doesn't that seem kind of long?

1182
01:43:29,979 --> 01:43:31,979
Is it okay if the utensil's in there?

1183
01:43:31,979 --> 01:43:33,979
Okay, I'm going to take a shower.

1184
01:43:33,979 --> 01:43:39,079
I'm so sorry. If you smell something, it's not me.

1185
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:44,390
I'm going to get fucking rid of this lady.

1186
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:46,390
My neighbor?

1187
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:49,079
What the fuck?

1188
01:43:49,079 --> 01:43:51,079
There's really nothing in this house.

1189
01:43:53,079 --> 01:44:01,640
So much better.

1190
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:14,060
I think I'm just going to piss.

1191
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:16,619
I'm just pissing right now.

1192
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:19,300
Well, the water was off. The water's off now.

1193
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:21,300
I want to pee now.

1194
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:23,300
Turn the water back on.

1195
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,300
Turn the water back on.

1196
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,300
You don't just pee into an empty shower.

1197
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:30,760
You pee when your shower's running.

1198
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,760
Everyone does it.

1199
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,760
And you can pretend like you don't.

1200
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,760
I know you do.

1201
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:45,380
It's better. I feel better.

1202
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,649
Sweetie?

1203
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:50,649
Are you there?

1204
01:44:50,649 --> 01:44:52,649
I would wash my hands, but...

1205
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:54,649
What was your name again?

1206
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:56,649
Justin?

1207
01:44:56,649 --> 01:45:01,380
Justin, are you there?

1208
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:03,380
Justin?

1209
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,380
You don't by chance have nitroglycerin

1210
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:07,380
pills or anything, do you?

1211
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:09,380
I don't... What was it?

1212
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,380
No medicine. No medicine at all.

1213
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,380
I've got acetaminophen. I've got

1214
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,380
ibuprofen. Okay, it's fine.

1215
01:45:15,380 --> 01:45:17,380
We're probably done by now.

1216
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:19,380
The cookies are done? Oh, yeah.

1217
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:21,380
I already sprinkled the pecan in there.

1218
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:23,380
Oh, you put the pecans in? Oh, thank you.

1219
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:27,739
Appreciate it.

1220
01:45:27,739 --> 01:45:29,739
Oh, my.

1221
01:45:29,739 --> 01:45:31,739
They smell heavenly.

1222
01:45:31,739 --> 01:45:33,739
They do smell fantastic. That's strange.

1223
01:45:33,739 --> 01:45:35,739
Just like my mother used to make them.

1224
01:45:35,739 --> 01:45:37,739
Well, open it up.

1225
01:45:37,739 --> 01:45:39,739
Let's see. How does it look?

1226
01:45:39,739 --> 01:45:41,739
The fruits of your labor.

1227
01:45:41,739 --> 01:45:43,739
Yeah, I mean, it's the fruits of our labor.

1228
01:45:43,739 --> 01:45:45,739
I might as well take a look and see.

1229
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:47,739
I'm curious. I think the plastic from the bowl

1230
01:45:47,739 --> 01:45:49,739
must have transitioned

1231
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:51,739
into this. Yes.

1232
01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:53,739
Is that the recipe? Yeah, that happens.

1233
01:45:53,739 --> 01:45:55,739
It's called osmosis. Right.

1234
01:45:55,739 --> 01:45:57,739
If you would have gone to school, you would have learned.

1235
01:45:57,739 --> 01:45:59,739
Edna, could you get one for me? I have raw egg

1236
01:45:59,739 --> 01:46:01,739
all over my hands that I don't want to get

1237
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:04,859
salmonella.

1238
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:06,859
You let my grandchildren salmonella?

1239
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:08,859
I've got like a thing in my throat.

1240
01:46:08,859 --> 01:46:10,859
My twin granddaughters salmonella,

1241
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:12,859
did they come by? No.

1242
01:46:12,859 --> 01:46:14,859
I'm talking about the food. They love

1243
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:16,859
these. I make them for them. They're very good.

1244
01:46:16,859 --> 01:46:18,859
Can I try? Would you like one?

1245
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:22,569
I thought, okay.

1246
01:46:22,569 --> 01:46:31,659
You can keep these, all right?

1247
01:46:31,659 --> 01:46:36,069
Let's see.

1248
01:46:36,069 --> 01:46:39,590
Just like sand at the beach.

1249
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,590
I feel sand

1250
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:43,590
all up in my underwear.

1251
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:45,590
It's fantastic.

1252
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:47,590
It feels great. You look like you're loving it.

1253
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:49,590
You look like it. I was probably

1254
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:51,590
at the beach at some point.

1255
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:53,829
These are fantastic. I know.

1256
01:46:53,829 --> 01:46:55,829
I know. Just like I told you. You just have to feel

1257
01:46:55,829 --> 01:46:57,829
it any time you want to make food, I swear.

1258
01:46:57,829 --> 01:46:59,829
Just put the stuff in there.

1259
01:46:59,829 --> 01:47:01,829
Feel it out.

1260
01:47:01,829 --> 01:47:03,829
It's been about seven or eight hours since you've showed up.

1261
01:47:03,829 --> 01:47:05,829
I think it's time maybe

1262
01:47:05,829 --> 01:47:07,829
Where do you live? Do you need help getting home?

1263
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:09,829
I usually get lost,

1264
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:11,829
but someone will call me and I'll have to go down

1265
01:47:11,829 --> 01:47:13,829
to the police department or the bank or something

1266
01:47:13,829 --> 01:47:15,829
like that. It will be fine.

1267
01:47:15,829 --> 01:47:17,829
Do you live in the neighborhood?

1268
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:19,829
I don't have a car. Yes, you don't have a car.

1269
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:21,829
I could point you to where your house is.

1270
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:23,829
It's somewhere

1271
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:25,829
around that way.

1272
01:47:25,829 --> 01:47:27,829
Because it's getting late.

1273
01:47:27,829 --> 01:47:29,829
I'm getting really tired, I'll be honest.

1274
01:47:29,829 --> 01:47:31,829
I need the gift basket back.

1275
01:47:31,829 --> 01:47:33,829
Could I have an apple?

1276
01:47:33,829 --> 01:47:35,829
Sure. Let me just have one apple.

1277
01:47:35,829 --> 01:47:37,829
It's a very beautiful apple

1278
01:47:37,829 --> 01:47:39,829
that you've given me.

1279
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,829
If there's anything you ever need, I know a lot of people.

1280
01:47:41,829 --> 01:47:43,829
Especially if you have computer

1281
01:47:43,829 --> 01:47:45,829
problems. You let me know, sweetheart.

1282
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:47,829
I wouldn't answer

1283
01:47:47,829 --> 01:47:49,829
the phone for very many people anymore.

1284
01:47:49,829 --> 01:47:51,829
I enjoy it. I have plenty of time.

1285
01:47:51,829 --> 01:47:53,829
It was nice to meet you.

1286
01:47:53,829 --> 01:47:55,829
It was a wonderful meeting.

1287
01:47:55,829 --> 01:47:57,829
Maybe I'll see you again. It was fantastic.

1288
01:47:57,829 --> 01:47:59,829
I'm sure. Thank you for

1289
01:47:59,829 --> 01:48:01,829
the recipe and everything. Absolutely.

1290
01:48:01,829 --> 01:48:03,829
Thank you. I'm exhausted.

1291
01:48:03,829 --> 01:48:06,069
I hope she gets home

1292
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:09,270
okay. Is she going to get home

1293
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:11,270
okay? Should I make sure she's okay?

1294
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:13,899
She said she doesn't even know if she lives.

1295
01:48:13,899 --> 01:48:16,579
I have no idea. Should I

1296
01:48:16,579 --> 01:48:20,229
make sure she's alright? I don't know.

1297
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:22,789
That was an interesting day.

1298
01:48:22,789 --> 01:48:30,710
Oh.

1299
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:33,270
She's here all day.

1300
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:35,270
I'm just trying to be nice. I'm not trying to

1301
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:37,270
get rid of an old lady or something.

1302
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:39,579
You're here all day.

1303
01:48:39,579 --> 01:48:42,010
I got the

1304
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:44,010
fitness instructor here.

1305
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:46,010
I feel a little tighter.

1306
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:48,869
I also feel like

1307
01:48:48,869 --> 01:48:51,300
we're doing this now apparently.

1308
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,300
I'm going to do this into the bedroom because

1309
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,300
I'm not going to leave another floor again.

1310
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,300
I'm slow to sleep on another floor.

1311
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:48,439
No. No thanks.

1312
01:56:48,439 --> 01:56:59,050
Ow.

1313
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:05,430
What's today?

1314
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:08,760
Saturday? Thursday?

1315
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,220
Tuesday? I don't know.

1316
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,220
Do I have something to do today? No.

1317
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:18,630
I don't know. I think three or four people are going to call

1318
01:57:18,630 --> 01:57:21,699
me. Like at a meeting.

1319
01:57:21,699 --> 01:57:24,199
I don't know. Whatever happened yesterday

1320
01:57:24,199 --> 01:57:26,199
I just forget it as of today. It sucks.

1321
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:30,810
It happens all the time.

1322
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,300
Somebody will bring me up to speed.

1323
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:41,369
This is a cool bed.

1324
01:57:41,369 --> 01:57:44,180
Not that cool.

1325
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:54,060
No. I don't want to.

1326
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:56,060
Not today. Something else.

1327
01:57:56,060 --> 01:57:58,060
Something else. Not today.

1328
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:00,060
Ah. Fuck. Whatever.

1329
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:08,380
Imagine not even being able to pee

1330
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:10,380
before you go to work. I'm coming.

1331
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,810
Just wait.

1332
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:18,119
Oops. Oh look.

1333
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:28,279
Peek hand sandies.

1334
01:58:28,279 --> 01:58:31,159
Time to make the money.

1335
01:58:31,159 --> 01:58:33,850
Wait. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm here.

1336
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:36,149
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Come on.

1337
01:58:36,149 --> 01:58:38,149
Why do you always pull so far down

1338
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:40,149
this fuck. You're pulling my driveway.

1339
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:42,149
You don't have to walk down the street to see you.

1340
01:58:42,149 --> 01:59:16,119
Hi Adam. Hi Sweden.

1341
01:59:16,119 --> 01:59:19,380
Are you with them? You're falling

1342
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:24,439
very far behind.

1343
01:59:24,439 --> 01:59:26,439
You know I actually don't. I don't trust people that fucking

1344
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:28,439
work out that much. Seriously.

1345
01:59:28,439 --> 01:59:30,439
Like what do you have to prove? What do you have to prove?

1346
01:59:30,439 --> 01:59:32,439
Like you can take a day off.

1347
01:59:32,439 --> 01:59:34,439
You go like Monday, Wednesday.

1348
01:59:34,439 --> 01:59:36,439
Like Tuesday, Thursday. Right? What do you have to prove?

1349
01:59:36,439 --> 01:59:38,439
Why are you working out literally seven days a week? There's no reason to.

1350
01:59:38,439 --> 01:59:40,869
Shit.

1351
01:59:40,869 --> 01:59:42,869
Hey. How are you?

1352
01:59:42,869 --> 01:59:44,869
Hi. Hi. It's really great

1353
01:59:44,869 --> 01:59:46,869
to see you again. It's so lovely to see you. Yes.

1354
01:59:46,869 --> 01:59:48,869
I'm one of those people that talks a lot of things

1355
01:59:48,869 --> 01:59:50,869
about somebody and then when they see them

1356
01:59:50,869 --> 01:59:52,869
they pretend like they didn't say those things at all.

1357
01:59:52,869 --> 01:59:54,869
How are you? Tomorrow morning.

1358
01:59:54,869 --> 01:59:56,869
Yes. Tomorrow morning.

1359
01:59:56,869 --> 01:59:58,869
Sixteen miles. Sixteen miles.

1360
01:59:58,869 --> 02:00:00,869
Sixteen miles. Yes. Of course.

1361
02:00:00,869 --> 02:00:02,869
Absolutely. Absolutely.

1362
02:00:04,869 --> 02:00:07,560
If you could do that away from my house.

1363
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,560
There's like six different

1364
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:11,560
intersections here. You could go down.

1365
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:14,119
I don't want to hear that in the morning

1366
02:00:14,119 --> 02:00:20,649
or in the night.

1367
02:00:20,649 --> 02:00:31,659
Fuck those people. I feel like shit.

1368
02:00:31,659 --> 02:00:36,119
Long day.

1369
02:00:36,119 --> 02:00:38,119
Colon D. Colon D. Colon D.

1370
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:40,119
I'm hungry and I want to shower.

1371
02:00:40,119 --> 02:00:42,119
And I'm not having a great time.

1372
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:44,119
Those people are having a great time outside.

1373
02:00:44,119 --> 02:00:46,119
Why can't I have a good time too?

1374
02:00:46,119 --> 02:00:49,260
I got like

1375
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:53,220
Ted shit here.

1376
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,399
Thank you. Some of you listen

1377
02:00:55,399 --> 02:00:57,640
and some of you don't.

1378
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:18,489
It's okay. Ah.

1379
02:01:18,489 --> 02:01:21,430
So much better.

1380
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:23,430
You know what I mean? It's like you work out so much

1381
02:01:23,430 --> 02:01:25,989
you don't have time for anything else.

1382
02:01:25,989 --> 02:01:27,989
I don't care how much you worked out.

1383
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,989
Look I'm just trying to live.

1384
02:01:29,989 --> 02:01:32,619
If I sit down and we're at lunch

1385
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:34,619
and you say like

1386
02:01:34,619 --> 02:01:36,619
oh hey dude by the way I fucking

1387
02:01:36,619 --> 02:01:38,619
I could do like five hundred pounds

1388
02:01:38,619 --> 02:01:40,619
five times for the rep. I don't care.

1389
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:42,859
That's good for you.

1390
02:01:42,859 --> 02:01:44,859
You're saying that because I can't do that.

1391
02:01:44,859 --> 02:01:46,859
You're saying that to me because I can't do it.

1392
02:01:46,859 --> 02:01:50,630
God.

1393
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:52,630
You know what I can do?

1394
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:55,829
I can do what they can?

1395
02:01:55,829 --> 02:01:58,390
Not much. Not very much at all actually.

1396
02:01:58,390 --> 02:02:00,390
Actually it hurts to walk around

1397
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:03,720
from me at the moment. But you know one day

1398
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:06,659
I'll get there. Ah.

1399
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:26,039
That feels better. Ah.

1400
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:29,560
What is this?

1401
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:31,560
But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength

1402
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,560
they shall mount up with wings as

1403
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:35,560
eagles. They shall run

1404
02:02:35,560 --> 02:02:37,560
and not be weary and they shall walk and not

1405
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:42,229
faint. You know I've actually seen

1406
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:44,920
this in somebody's bathroom before.

1407
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:46,920
I've seen that before.

1408
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:50,949
Whatever. I guess here it is.

1409
02:02:50,949 --> 02:02:58,819
Showered.

1410
02:02:58,819 --> 02:03:01,130
I feel clean. I feel good.

1411
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:03,130
Although I'm kind of not having a

1412
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:05,130
great time but you know whatever.

1413
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:07,939
I got my expensive watch. That's all

1414
02:03:07,939 --> 02:03:19,020
that matters right? Let's go to the

1415
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:28,489
bathroom. Let's fucking stool out of the way.

1416
02:03:28,489 --> 02:03:39,300
I don't know.

1417
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:41,300
I have to look at this every time I pee.

1418
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:43,609
Something about that. By the way

1419
02:03:43,609 --> 02:03:45,609
that's like what are you blurring?

1420
02:03:45,609 --> 02:03:47,909
There's somebody like sitting

1421
02:03:47,909 --> 02:03:49,909
on that toilet that you're blurring.

1422
02:03:49,909 --> 02:03:52,409
Who is that? That's

1423
02:03:52,409 --> 02:03:55,029
not me.

1424
02:03:55,029 --> 02:03:57,979
Oops! Wait I'm done.

1425
02:03:57,979 --> 02:04:01,239
Okay we're good. Like there's somebody

1426
02:04:01,239 --> 02:04:03,239
else sitting on that toilet.

1427
02:04:03,239 --> 02:04:06,890
No no no no no. I'm going to the

1428
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:18,340
bedroom. You gave me this like mystery

1429
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:21,220
box of stools.

1430
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:28,260
I'm gonna place them. What time is it?

1431
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:34,199
It's pretty late.

1432
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:36,199
It's alright. We'll put two here.

1433
02:04:36,199 --> 02:04:39,899
We'll put one over here.

1434
02:04:39,899 --> 02:04:44,760
Not like it matters.

1435
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,760
I don't know. I'm getting kind of annoyed.

1436
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:50,659
What do I even need these stools for?

1437
02:04:50,659 --> 02:04:52,659
I'm okay. Don't get too

1438
02:04:52,659 --> 02:04:56,250
upset. Hey this is how tall

1439
02:04:56,250 --> 02:05:00,020
I want to be. All of you are the five

1440
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:02,649
seven men out there.

1441
02:05:02,649 --> 02:05:04,649
You ever thought about this? You ever think about how big you were?

1442
02:05:04,649 --> 02:05:06,649
If you were this big?

1443
02:05:06,649 --> 02:05:10,300
This is what? Six? Six two?

1444
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:12,539
Man. God.

1445
02:05:12,539 --> 02:05:14,539
What a figure that would be. Wouldn't it?

1446
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:20,220
How about um

1447
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:24,890
I don't know. We can put them next to the bed.

1448
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:29,939
How about like one here?

1449
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:33,960
One here. And then

1450
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:36,649
should all three go over there?

1451
02:05:36,649 --> 02:05:39,140
I don't hate that. I really

1452
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:51,180
don't. Three stools

1453
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:53,180
in front of the bed. I don't know if you

1454
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:56,569
get on the side. If you're as tired

1455
02:05:56,569 --> 02:05:58,569
as I am right now that seems like a pretty good idea.

1456
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:00,810
That means I can get out of the bed. I can put

1457
02:06:00,810 --> 02:06:02,810
my feet down on three different

1458
02:06:02,810 --> 02:06:06,069
places.

1459
02:06:06,069 --> 02:06:15,340
I am tired. How much

1460
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:17,340
cash do we have? How much money?

1461
02:06:17,340 --> 02:06:20,920
What do we got for cash?

1462
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:24,250
$19.60.

1463
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:26,250
Give me something nice for god's sake.

1464
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:33,289
I got money. So no, that makes sense

1465
02:06:33,289 --> 02:06:35,289
because then I don't have to clean all this shit up. That's a good idea.

1466
02:06:35,289 --> 02:06:39,770
Calling a maid is a good idea.

1467
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:42,010
Thank you.

1468
02:06:42,010 --> 02:06:46,420
Because the last, I don't want to

1469
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:48,420
clean anything up. I want to be able to have somebody else do it.

1470
02:06:48,420 --> 02:06:50,420
We got almost two grand. Let's

1471
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:55,270
use it. Hi.

1472
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:57,270
Yes. I would love to, I'd like to have

1473
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:00,920
a service started please.

1474
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,920
Yeah the address is 985-985

1475
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:05,670
Dollhouse Way.

1476
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:07,670
I mean you know. You're in this fucked up

1477
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:09,670
cartoon universe with the rest of us.

1478
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:13,300
Yeah. Okay.

1479
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:15,670
Thank you. Do you live in the neighborhood

1480
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,670
too? Are you like down the street?

1481
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:20,739
Because it seems like everybody lives next to each other here.

1482
02:07:20,739 --> 02:07:23,350
Okay. Thank you.

1483
02:07:23,350 --> 02:07:25,350
Today? I mean I'm tired but okay fine.

1484
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:27,350
That's fine. Alright goodbye.

1485
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:30,810
Alright let's get a maid in here. I don't want to have to deal with this.

1486
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:35,930
They'll take care of it.

1487
02:07:35,930 --> 02:07:37,930
That was very quick.

1488
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:39,930
They must live in the neighborhood.

1489
02:07:39,930 --> 02:07:45,300
I'm so tired though.

1490
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:50,020
Alright.

1491
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:52,020
Maid service.

1492
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:55,220
Here we are. Hi.

1493
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:58,470
Hi.

1494
02:07:58,470 --> 02:08:00,470
I'm assuming that you must be the maid?

1495
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:02,470
I heard you ordered a sexy maid

1496
02:08:02,470 --> 02:08:04,470
service.

1497
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:08,949
You have a big mess to clean

1498
02:08:08,949 --> 02:08:10,949
don't you? Stop doing the lap track. I don't want that.

1499
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:12,949
Yes there's a mess in here.

1500
02:08:12,949 --> 02:08:14,949
It's very messy. Well trust me I can take

1501
02:08:14,949 --> 02:08:17,319
care of your big mess.

1502
02:08:17,319 --> 02:08:19,319
Okay come on in. Show me where it is.

1503
02:08:19,319 --> 02:08:21,319
So I pretty much what I want you to do.

1504
02:08:21,319 --> 02:08:23,319
Come on in. Watch the door behind you.

1505
02:08:23,319 --> 02:08:25,319
Don't want to get hit by that.

1506
02:08:25,319 --> 02:08:27,319
Such a gentleman.

1507
02:08:27,319 --> 02:08:29,319
Wow. What a unique arrangement.

1508
02:08:29,319 --> 02:08:31,319
So there's this

1509
02:08:31,319 --> 02:08:33,319
trash here.

1510
02:08:33,319 --> 02:08:35,319
This is dusty?

1511
02:08:35,319 --> 02:08:37,319
Yes it is. It's very dusty. So if you want to dust

1512
02:08:37,319 --> 02:08:39,319
there's some fruit here that needs to be cleaned up.

1513
02:08:39,319 --> 02:08:41,319
Oh saw stain.

1514
02:08:41,319 --> 02:08:43,319
Yes thank you.

1515
02:08:43,319 --> 02:08:45,319
So there's in the bathroom the toilet needs to be cleaned.

1516
02:08:45,319 --> 02:08:47,319
The trash needs to be taken out.

1517
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:49,319
This flower, the fridge needs to be cleaned.

1518
02:08:49,319 --> 02:08:51,319
This room, the bathroom, any other rooms?

1519
02:08:51,319 --> 02:08:53,319
Yes come with me. I'll show you.

1520
02:08:53,319 --> 02:08:56,579
Bathroom definitely needs to be

1521
02:08:56,579 --> 02:08:58,579
cleaned. The sinks need to be cleaned.

1522
02:08:58,579 --> 02:09:00,579
If you have an opportunity to it would be great.

1523
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:02,579
How much do you charge?

1524
02:09:02,579 --> 02:09:04,579
Well for you I'll drop my

1525
02:09:04,579 --> 02:09:06,579
prices to $2,000.

1526
02:09:06,579 --> 02:09:08,819
That's $2,000 for this?

1527
02:09:08,819 --> 02:09:10,819
For the sexy

1528
02:09:10,819 --> 02:09:12,819
maid service. Why is this $2,000?

1529
02:09:12,819 --> 02:09:14,819
No it's like $100.

1530
02:09:14,819 --> 02:09:16,819
It's not $2,000. Well lead me to the bedroom

1531
02:09:16,819 --> 02:09:18,819
and I can show I'm worth $2,000.

1532
02:09:18,819 --> 02:09:20,819
No.

1533
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:22,819
$2,000.

1534
02:09:22,819 --> 02:09:24,819
What are you trying to say?

1535
02:09:24,819 --> 02:09:26,819
Am I not sexy?

1536
02:09:26,819 --> 02:09:28,819
I didn't say any of that.

1537
02:09:28,819 --> 02:09:30,819
I'm looking for a maid service to come and help clean up

1538
02:09:30,819 --> 02:09:32,819
maybe make the bed. Okay.

1539
02:09:32,819 --> 02:09:34,819
How sexy am I worth?

1540
02:09:34,819 --> 02:09:37,130
I don't have $2,000.

1541
02:09:37,130 --> 02:09:39,130
Okay well you're the one who called

1542
02:09:39,130 --> 02:09:41,130
a sexy maid service.

1543
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:44,069
Well honestly

1544
02:09:44,069 --> 02:09:46,069
I think you look great. I do.

1545
02:09:46,069 --> 02:09:48,069
I think you're probably the best looking

1546
02:09:48,069 --> 02:09:50,069
maid service maid I've ever seen in my life.

1547
02:09:50,069 --> 02:09:53,779
Do you mean that?

1548
02:09:53,779 --> 02:09:55,779
Yes of course. Go on.

1549
02:09:55,779 --> 02:09:58,020
I think you're the most attractive

1550
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:00,020
sexiest maid ever.

1551
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:02,649
I do. I really do.

1552
02:10:02,649 --> 02:10:04,649
Please keep going. You're so

1553
02:10:04,649 --> 02:10:06,649
wonderful.

1554
02:10:06,649 --> 02:10:08,649
Let me show you the bathroom.

1555
02:10:08,649 --> 02:10:10,649
Okay.

1556
02:10:10,649 --> 02:10:14,039
So I have a

1557
02:10:14,039 --> 02:10:16,039
plunger. I have a

1558
02:10:16,039 --> 02:10:18,039
plunger and if anything ever happens

1559
02:10:18,039 --> 02:10:20,039
with the toilet I'm sure you'll be coming and going over the

1560
02:10:20,039 --> 02:10:22,039
course of the day. Do you just want me to clean

1561
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:24,279
your house?

1562
02:10:24,279 --> 02:10:27,289
Yeah.

1563
02:10:27,289 --> 02:10:29,289
Why didn't you just call a regular

1564
02:10:29,289 --> 02:10:31,289
I'm a sexy maid.

1565
02:10:31,289 --> 02:10:33,289
What do you mean sexy

1566
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:35,289
maid? Well like a regular maid service

1567
02:10:35,289 --> 02:10:37,289
is like $100 maybe $200

1568
02:10:37,289 --> 02:10:39,289
but when you add the sexy it's $2,000

1569
02:10:39,289 --> 02:10:41,289
for a maid. Well what would you do for

1570
02:10:41,289 --> 02:10:43,289
$100?

1571
02:10:43,289 --> 02:10:45,289
Clean your house I guess. That's perfect

1572
02:10:45,289 --> 02:10:47,289
that works for me. $200?

1573
02:10:47,289 --> 02:10:49,289
Okay. Are you coming here every other day?

1574
02:10:49,289 --> 02:10:51,289
Yeah I'll come. You still

1575
02:10:51,289 --> 02:10:53,289
think I look sexy though right? I do.

1576
02:10:53,289 --> 02:10:55,289
Is that alright with you?

1577
02:10:55,289 --> 02:10:57,289
You want to go lower? That's okay with $150

1578
02:10:57,289 --> 02:10:59,289
for just cleaning.

1579
02:10:59,289 --> 02:11:01,289
But if you're ever interested in

1580
02:11:01,289 --> 02:11:03,289
expanding my rules

1581
02:11:03,289 --> 02:11:05,289
Yes I will keep that very much in mind if you

1582
02:11:05,289 --> 02:11:07,289
come this way and just take a look and

1583
02:11:07,289 --> 02:11:09,289
start doing your thing. I'll clean over here.

1584
02:11:09,289 --> 02:11:12,489
Pick that before I fucking shit

1585
02:11:12,489 --> 02:11:15,369
my pants in front of the maid.

1586
02:11:15,369 --> 02:11:17,369
Sexy maid

1587
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,800
$2,000

1588
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:26,899
that's so much money. I'm just

1589
02:11:26,899 --> 02:11:29,140
trying to get my life together in here before I go

1590
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:34,260
back in there.

1591
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:36,260
And I'm fucking tired too.

1592
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:44,310
It's four.

1593
02:11:44,310 --> 02:11:46,310
Thank you so much.

1594
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:53,989
Wait where is it going?

1595
02:11:53,989 --> 02:11:55,989
Wait what?

1596
02:11:55,989 --> 02:11:57,989
Am I sick?

1597
02:11:57,989 --> 02:11:59,989
Do I have like the

1598
02:11:59,989 --> 02:12:01,989
norovirus? Like what's happening?

1599
02:12:01,989 --> 02:12:03,989
Sir? Yeah?

1600
02:12:03,989 --> 02:12:05,989
Are you alright? I'm okay

1601
02:12:05,989 --> 02:12:07,989
in here. You don't have to come in. Do you have a big

1602
02:12:07,989 --> 02:12:09,989
mess you need cleaning?

1603
02:12:09,989 --> 02:12:12,420
No

1604
02:12:12,420 --> 02:12:14,420
You can stay out there. Okay.

1605
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:17,430
Alright that's good.

1606
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:20,250
What did I eat? Those

1607
02:12:20,250 --> 02:12:22,250
pecan sandies I swear to god.

1608
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:29,539
Do you like food?

1609
02:12:29,539 --> 02:12:32,039
Yeah. Do you like bread?

1610
02:12:32,039 --> 02:12:34,039
Yeah. I wonder if

1611
02:12:34,039 --> 02:12:36,039
Yes this bread

1612
02:12:36,039 --> 02:12:38,039
I got multi grain bread over there.

1613
02:12:38,039 --> 02:12:40,039
Do you like multi grain bread? Yeah I like multi grain

1614
02:12:40,039 --> 02:12:42,039
bread. Could I ask you

1615
02:12:42,039 --> 02:12:44,279
why?

1616
02:12:44,279 --> 02:12:46,710
Aesthetically I thought it made sense

1617
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:48,710
to put it in the corner here to make sure there's enough room

1618
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:50,710
for people to come around. There's not enough space.

1619
02:12:50,710 --> 02:12:52,710
Maybe eventually there will be a TV up here

1620
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:54,710
like a big screen TV up here.

1621
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:56,710
Yeah like they could watch the TV

1622
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:58,710
play video games. It would have made sense to make it flush.

1623
02:12:58,710 --> 02:13:00,710
Well you're a maid

1624
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:02,710
you're not an interior designer. You're right

1625
02:13:02,710 --> 02:13:10,069
I'm just a maid.

1626
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:12,069
That was the bread. That was the bread we have to eat.

1627
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:14,949
I'll clean the bathroom next.

1628
02:13:14,949 --> 02:13:37,270
I can still eat it.

1629
02:13:37,270 --> 02:13:39,270
Excuse me

1630
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:41,270
sexy maid. What?

1631
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:43,270
Would you like a piece of

1632
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:46,090
bread? Sure.

1633
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:50,569
Okay.

1634
02:13:50,569 --> 02:13:52,569
Let's get some bread on the fucking stove top.

1635
02:13:52,569 --> 02:13:56,020
Would you like a piece of bread?

1636
02:13:56,020 --> 02:14:01,399
I've got bread and you throw it on the ground but it's okay.

1637
02:14:01,399 --> 02:14:04,409
Why don't you grab a piece of bread? I want you

1638
02:14:04,409 --> 02:14:07,289
to eat. Well I've been cleaning

1639
02:14:07,289 --> 02:14:09,289
I wouldn't dare touch it with my hands.

1640
02:14:09,289 --> 02:14:11,289
Right but if you just eat

1641
02:14:11,289 --> 02:14:15,130
wash your hands and then eat.

1642
02:14:15,130 --> 02:14:17,130
I'm not putting it in your mouth. Right. No of course.

1643
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:20,460
Sorry I'm just used

1644
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:22,460
to different clients is all.

1645
02:14:22,460 --> 02:14:28,579
Out of here. Out of here.

1646
02:14:28,579 --> 02:14:31,460
I'm getting out of here. I'm going to the bathroom.

1647
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:36,840
I'm going to the bathroom.

1648
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:39,140
I'm going to stay here.

1649
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:41,140
And excuse me

1650
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:44,279
this job

1651
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:46,279
is not done.

1652
02:14:46,279 --> 02:14:49,859
The maid is scaring me.

1653
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:55,100
Our job's not done.

1654
02:14:55,100 --> 02:15:00,220
I'm so tired.

1655
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:02,220
God. I think I'm going to pass out.

1656
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:04,460
I think I'm really going to pass out. I need to go to bed.

1657
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:08,100
I have to go to bed so bad.

1658
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:13,289
I'm sorry if I smell a little weird.

1659
02:15:13,289 --> 02:15:15,289
It's just it's been a long day.

1660
02:15:15,289 --> 02:15:19,960
Well that's two hundred dollars.

1661
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:22,840
Are you going to. What?

1662
02:15:22,840 --> 02:15:26,170
Two hundred? I thought it was one fifty.

1663
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:28,859
I cleaned more than I thought I

1664
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:30,859
had to. There was a big mess in the bathroom.

1665
02:15:30,859 --> 02:15:33,859
Okay take two hundred.

1666
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:36,300
Alright sir well

1667
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,300
I'll see you in a few days. Yeah

1668
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:40,300
and it's a hundred fifty each time right?

1669
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:42,300
From here on out we'll talk about it.

1670
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,300
And we're not doing anything else. Do you still

1671
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:46,300
want me to wear this next time I come?

1672
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:48,300
If you like if you're comfortable

1673
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:50,300
wearing that you can. You dog.

1674
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:59,960
It's been a weird day.

1675
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:02,949
I'm tired. Give me something

1676
02:16:02,949 --> 02:16:04,949
to play with. Give me something to hang out with.

1677
02:16:04,949 --> 02:16:06,949
I mean you guys seriously like I

1678
02:16:06,949 --> 02:16:08,949
I got to go to bed. I can't just

1679
02:16:08,949 --> 02:16:10,949
sleep on a couch every fucking day.

1680
02:16:10,949 --> 02:16:12,949
Give me like give me like give me the bedroom.

1681
02:16:12,949 --> 02:16:21,399
Get me to get me to bed. What is it?

1682
02:16:21,399 --> 02:16:28,890
What does it say?

1683
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:35,670
You didn't want it. What? Why

1684
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:45,209
not? Scammed.

1685
02:16:45,209 --> 02:16:49,819
I literally I can all I

1686
02:16:49,819 --> 02:16:51,819
can see is colors. It's the only

1687
02:16:51,819 --> 02:16:53,819
thing I can see. I just see pink and I see like

1688
02:16:53,819 --> 02:16:55,819
green. I see pink here.

1689
02:16:55,819 --> 02:17:00,809
It's just pink.

1690
02:17:00,809 --> 02:17:02,809
I need somebody who has to tell me to go to bed.

1691
02:17:02,809 --> 02:17:04,809
If I don't then

1692
02:17:04,809 --> 02:17:06,809
you're just going to get me fucked up again. All I see

1693
02:17:06,809 --> 02:17:09,879
is pink colors.

1694
02:17:09,879 --> 02:17:11,879
That was really cool made. I really thought they were

1695
02:17:11,879 --> 02:17:13,879
cool. I like to work out with people too.

1696
02:17:13,879 --> 02:17:16,059
I'm going to get into the bedroom as fast

1697
02:17:16,059 --> 02:17:18,059
as I can because I don't want to have a problem.

1698
02:17:18,059 --> 02:17:20,739
For the first time fucking ever.

1699
02:17:20,739 --> 02:17:22,739
For the first time ever you

1700
02:17:22,739 --> 02:17:24,739
make me go to sleep. Thank you.

1701
02:17:24,739 --> 02:17:26,739
Seriously like this is the first time you've ever done it.

1702
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:28,739
Took you long enough.

1703
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:52,329
What is that?

1704
02:26:52,329 --> 02:27:03,270
What is that?

1705
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:05,270
Why is there a computer in front of my fucking

1706
02:27:05,270 --> 02:27:09,370
door?

1707
02:27:09,370 --> 02:27:11,370
There's a computer here? What is outside?

1708
02:27:11,370 --> 02:27:16,739
I hear something.

1709
02:27:16,739 --> 02:27:21,159
Dog or something?

1710
02:27:21,159 --> 02:27:23,159
Oh no.

1711
02:27:23,159 --> 02:27:29,799
My god.

1712
02:27:29,799 --> 02:27:31,799
Oh my fucking god.

1713
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:36,620
What am I doing in this scenario?

1714
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:38,620
Is it because of the food? Oh it's trash.

1715
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:46,170
What time is it?

1716
02:27:46,170 --> 02:27:48,469
It's like

1717
02:27:48,469 --> 02:27:52,180
one o'clock in the morning.

1718
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:57,690
Oh shit.

1719
02:27:57,690 --> 02:27:59,690
Can you see me? I hope you can't see me.

1720
02:27:59,690 --> 02:28:03,399
What am I supposed to do about this?

1721
02:28:03,399 --> 02:28:06,790
I got to go in the bedroom.

1722
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:08,790
Oh my god.

1723
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:11,159
Yay.

1724
02:28:11,159 --> 02:28:18,260
A computer. Cool.

1725
02:28:18,260 --> 02:28:20,819
Huh?

1726
02:28:20,819 --> 02:28:24,409
You want to do what?

1727
02:28:24,409 --> 02:28:26,409
No I'm not going out there.

1728
02:28:26,409 --> 02:28:30,700
What the fuck am I?

1729
02:28:33,700 --> 02:28:35,700
Alright it's time for you to pay.

1730
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:38,579
I don't want to go out here.

1731
02:28:38,579 --> 02:28:40,579
Why would you make me do this?

1732
02:28:40,579 --> 02:28:42,579
Hey bear you're in deep shit.

1733
02:28:47,059 --> 02:28:49,059
Oh my god.

1734
02:28:49,059 --> 02:28:51,059
He's biting me.

1735
02:28:51,059 --> 02:28:53,059
Jesus.

1736
02:28:53,059 --> 02:28:55,059
Play dead.

1737
02:28:55,059 --> 02:28:57,059
Play dead.

1738
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:58,489
What are you doing?

1739
02:29:58,489 --> 02:30:06,920
Do you see what he did out here?

1740
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:08,920
Why would you make me go confront him?

1741
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:12,500
Are you out of your mind?

1742
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,500
Are you out of your mind?

1743
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:17,770
What am I going to do

1744
02:30:17,770 --> 02:30:19,770
versus a bear that's five times

1745
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:23,290
as big as me?

1746
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:29,190
I didn't sleep all the way through the night.

1747
02:30:29,190 --> 02:30:36,020
Oh.

1748
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,020
Good thing I have a maid.

1749
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:40,020
At least I've been able to help me clean this shit up.

1750
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:42,020
Close the door

1751
02:30:42,020 --> 02:30:44,020
for the love of god.

1752
02:30:44,020 --> 02:30:46,020
Why are there bears here?

1753
02:31:03,110 --> 02:31:08,870
I'm here.

1754
02:31:08,870 --> 02:31:28,120
Wait.

1755
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:32,940
Go fuck yourself.

1756
02:31:32,940 --> 02:32:06,260
Good thing I got my watch.

1757
02:32:06,260 --> 02:32:08,760
I feel so bad.

1758
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:11,579
There's a mess in my yard.

1759
02:32:11,579 --> 02:32:13,579
There's a mess in my yard.

1760
02:32:13,579 --> 02:32:15,579
There's a mess.

1761
02:32:15,579 --> 02:32:18,459
There's a mess in my yard.

1762
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,840
Wait a minute.

1763
02:32:40,780 --> 02:32:42,950
I'm covered in scrapes.

1764
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:44,950
I'm covered in bruises.

1765
02:32:44,950 --> 02:32:46,950
I need to sleep a lot for a while

1766
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:48,950
and then I need to eat

1767
02:32:48,950 --> 02:32:57,139
if I have something to do.

1768
02:32:57,139 --> 02:33:01,559
Holy shit.

1769
02:33:01,559 --> 02:33:04,120
I can't stream right now.

1770
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:06,120
There's no way I can stream.

1771
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:08,120
What do you want me to stream?

1772
02:33:08,120 --> 02:33:10,120
Oh no.

1773
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:12,120
No, I refuse.

1774
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:14,120
I can't.

1775
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:16,120
I can't.

1776
02:33:16,120 --> 02:33:18,870
I can't.

1777
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:21,750
I can't.

1778
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:23,750
Oh.

1779
02:33:23,750 --> 02:33:31,750
Oh.

1780
02:33:31,750 --> 02:33:35,139
Oh.

1781
02:33:35,139 --> 02:33:37,139
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

1782
02:33:37,139 --> 02:33:39,139
It's Jerma here.

1783
02:33:39,139 --> 02:33:41,139
We're going to be playing some Call of Duty.

1784
02:33:41,139 --> 02:33:43,139
So as you can see here,

1785
02:33:43,139 --> 02:33:45,139
I'm going to be in the menu for a little while.

1786
02:33:45,139 --> 02:33:47,139
And welcome to the stream.

1787
02:33:47,139 --> 02:33:49,139
It's good to have you here.

1788
02:33:49,139 --> 02:33:51,139
Of course, I have a pretty good day today.

1789
02:33:51,139 --> 02:33:53,139
I had a crazy scenario happen.

1790
02:33:53,139 --> 02:33:55,139
A crazy scenario.

1791
02:33:55,139 --> 02:33:57,450
Hold on, let me get in here.

1792
02:33:57,450 --> 02:33:59,450
What's that?

1793
02:33:59,450 --> 02:34:01,450
No way, dude. That's so funny.

1794
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:03,450
I saw a bear outside today.

1795
02:34:03,450 --> 02:34:05,450
And I walked out there.

1796
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:07,450
And I was like, what the heck is that bear?

1797
02:34:07,450 --> 02:34:09,450
And eventually, I went outside.

1798
02:34:09,450 --> 02:34:11,450
And I did a little horn.

1799
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:13,450
And the bear got away from the horn.

1800
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:32,940
I shit and I sleep.

1801
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:36,459
What does it say?

1802
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:38,889
The water does that.

1803
02:41:38,889 --> 02:41:41,829
You have been banned from Twitch

1804
02:41:41,829 --> 02:41:43,829
for 24 hours.

1805
02:41:43,829 --> 02:41:46,520
This is temporary ban for sleeping on stream.

1806
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:48,520
Oh, what the fuck?

1807
02:41:48,520 --> 02:41:53,700
What?

1808
02:41:53,700 --> 02:41:55,700
When did I go to sleep on stream?

1809
02:41:55,700 --> 02:42:01,399
What are you talking about?

1810
02:42:01,399 --> 02:42:07,989
Give me a fucking break.

1811
02:42:07,989 --> 02:42:09,989
That's the first ban I've ever had.

1812
02:42:09,989 --> 02:42:12,420
Are you sure I didn't get banned because I'm streaming from my toilet?

1813
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:17,030
Sleeping on stream,

1814
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:19,030
I think it's way less offensive

1815
02:42:19,030 --> 02:42:21,030
than shitting on the toilet and streaming.

1816
02:42:21,030 --> 02:42:24,299
Just like that.

1817
02:42:24,299 --> 02:42:27,500
That's six, by the way.

1818
02:42:27,500 --> 02:42:38,500
I'd like to take a shower right now, please.

1819
02:42:38,500 --> 02:42:52,569
That's the first ban I've ever had.

1820
02:42:52,569 --> 02:42:57,819
I hope I didn't say anything weird in my sleep.

1821
02:42:57,819 --> 02:43:01,340
I'm fucking starving and stuff.

1822
02:43:01,340 --> 02:43:03,340
Oh, yay.

1823
02:43:03,340 --> 02:43:08,069
Ah.

1824
02:43:08,069 --> 02:43:11,659
Banned from Twitch.

1825
02:43:11,659 --> 02:43:14,219
Can I call anybody?

1826
02:43:14,219 --> 02:43:19,270
I don't know.

1827
02:43:19,270 --> 02:43:21,270
I say all kinds of weird fucked up shit.

1828
02:43:21,270 --> 02:43:23,770
Let me just brush my teeth real quick.

1829
02:43:23,770 --> 02:43:27,350
Brush your teeth and shower.

1830
02:43:27,350 --> 02:43:29,350
It saves about five minutes.

1831
02:43:29,350 --> 02:43:31,590
That's a pro tip for everybody.

1832
02:43:31,590 --> 02:43:41,819
Coming up.

1833
02:43:41,819 --> 02:43:43,819
So what happened?

1834
02:43:43,819 --> 02:43:45,819
There's an office chair

1835
02:43:45,819 --> 02:43:48,500
next to the toilet.

1836
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:50,809
Why would there be

1837
02:43:50,809 --> 02:43:52,809
an office chair here?

1838
02:43:52,809 --> 02:43:55,299
In case somebody wanted to watch?

1839
02:43:55,299 --> 02:43:57,299
Oh, hey, man, you got an extra seat?

1840
02:43:57,299 --> 02:43:59,299
Yeah, go ahead. You sit in the toilet, I'll watch you.

1841
02:43:59,299 --> 02:44:01,299
Why is there an office chair?

1842
02:44:01,299 --> 02:44:04,250
I'm starving.

1843
02:44:04,250 --> 02:44:11,479
There's a piece of bread on the ground.

1844
02:44:11,479 --> 02:44:18,889
Good.

1845
02:44:22,149 --> 02:44:24,149
I'm not going to work today, by the way,

1846
02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:26,149
just in case you were curious.

1847
02:44:26,149 --> 02:44:28,149
Not going to work.

1848
02:44:28,149 --> 02:44:30,569
You can leave without me.

1849
02:44:30,569 --> 02:44:33,129
I got plenty of money.

1850
02:44:33,129 --> 02:44:35,129
Go on. Not going to work.

1851
02:44:35,129 --> 02:44:38,069
Go on without me.

1852
02:44:38,069 --> 02:44:40,069
Tell the boss I said I'm the biggest producer

1853
02:44:40,069 --> 02:44:42,950
so I can stay home.

1854
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:44,950
What is this?

1855
02:44:49,430 --> 02:44:57,690
Does this work?

1856
02:44:57,690 --> 02:45:00,569
Is this an organ?

1857
02:45:00,569 --> 02:45:25,340
I don't think it works.

1858
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:27,700
We play Radical Dreamers

1859
02:45:27,700 --> 02:45:31,159
from Chrono Cross.

1860
02:45:31,159 --> 02:46:06,280
Pretty good.

1861
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:08,709
How about Super Mario?

1862
02:46:17,479 --> 02:46:19,479
That's terrible.

1863
02:46:19,479 --> 02:46:21,719
Can I do reverb?

1864
02:46:32,979 --> 02:46:37,190
What?

1865
02:46:46,979 --> 02:46:48,979
There we go.

1866
02:47:02,069 --> 02:47:04,069
What do they want me to do?

1867
02:47:04,069 --> 02:47:17,180
Food.

1868
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:19,180
How about a piece of bread?

1869
02:47:19,180 --> 02:47:23,719
Because it's the easiest thing to make.

1870
02:47:23,719 --> 02:47:35,750
I like to toast it.

1871
02:47:35,750 --> 02:47:38,819
I like to toast it real quick.

1872
02:47:38,819 --> 02:47:46,299
Better.

1873
02:47:46,299 --> 02:47:50,629
I do have to pee though.

1874
02:47:50,629 --> 02:47:54,979
Or, you know, the other one.

1875
02:47:54,979 --> 02:47:57,989
I'm sad that the maid threw this

1876
02:47:57,989 --> 02:47:59,989
on the ground though.

1877
02:47:59,989 --> 02:48:04,659
I'm going to play with the organ again.

1878
02:48:04,659 --> 02:48:12,340
It works.

1879
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:24,500
What do the pedals do?

1880
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:26,500
Holy shit.

1881
02:48:53,620 --> 02:48:57,959
Hey.

1882
02:48:57,959 --> 02:49:02,360
What?

1883
02:49:02,360 --> 02:49:06,760
Ludwig?

1884
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:08,760
What are you doing here?

1885
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:11,129
I live here.

1886
02:49:11,129 --> 02:49:13,879
You live here?

1887
02:49:13,879 --> 02:49:15,879
What are you talking about?

1888
02:49:15,879 --> 02:49:17,879
I'm sorry.

1889
02:49:17,879 --> 02:49:19,879
I've lived here for seven years.

1890
02:49:19,879 --> 02:49:21,879
Hold on.

1891
02:49:21,879 --> 02:49:23,879
983, 983.

1892
02:49:23,879 --> 02:49:25,879
You're 983?

1893
02:49:25,879 --> 02:49:28,180
I'm 983.

1894
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:30,180
I do not know.

1895
02:49:30,180 --> 02:49:32,180
Hold on.

1896
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:34,180
Don't mind any of this shit.

1897
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:36,180
It's fine.

1898
02:49:36,180 --> 02:49:38,180
Why do you have a

1899
02:49:38,180 --> 02:49:40,180
trash everywhere?

1900
02:49:40,180 --> 02:49:42,180
Don't worry about that.

1901
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:44,180
There was a tornado that came in.

1902
02:49:44,180 --> 02:49:46,180
Did you see the tornado that came in?

1903
02:49:46,180 --> 02:49:48,180
They come sometimes.

1904
02:49:48,180 --> 02:49:50,180
A tornado flew through here.

1905
02:49:53,450 --> 02:49:55,450
The tornado flew in

1906
02:49:55,450 --> 02:49:57,450
and it swarmed everybody.

1907
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:59,450
You didn't get that?

1908
02:49:59,450 --> 02:50:01,940
The gloves are also

1909
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:03,940
confusing to me. Is that normal?

1910
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:05,940
Yeah, it's very normal.

1911
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:08,120
Tornado came in, ruined

1912
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:10,120
everything.

1913
02:50:10,120 --> 02:50:12,120
It's nice to see you.

1914
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:14,120
Do you want to come in?

1915
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:16,120
Sure.

1916
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:18,120
I was just playing this because

1917
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:20,120
it was a gift from a friend of mine.

1918
02:50:22,739 --> 02:50:24,739
I'll get it for you.

1919
02:50:24,739 --> 02:50:26,739
We should clean.

1920
02:50:26,739 --> 02:50:29,750
I want to clean first.

1921
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:31,750
Can you just help me for a second?

1922
02:50:31,750 --> 02:50:33,750
Sure.

1923
02:50:35,750 --> 02:50:37,750
When did you move in here?

1924
02:50:37,750 --> 02:50:39,750
By the way, I had a raider.

1925
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:41,750
Excuse me. Sheriff Tony

1926
02:50:41,750 --> 02:50:43,750
Andrews. How are you guys doing?

1927
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:45,750
We're looking for a bear.

1928
02:50:45,750 --> 02:50:47,750
Have you seen the bear around here?

1929
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:49,750
We're going around the whole neighborhood.

1930
02:50:49,750 --> 02:50:51,750
I've got animal control with me.

1931
02:50:51,750 --> 02:50:53,750
He's an expert.

1932
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:55,750
A tornado came in and a bear came in.

1933
02:50:55,750 --> 02:50:57,750
There was a bear and a tornado?

1934
02:50:57,750 --> 02:50:59,750
I kicked the shit out of the bear.

1935
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:01,750
There was a tornado.

1936
02:51:01,750 --> 02:51:03,750
Smell him.

1937
02:51:03,750 --> 02:51:05,750
There was a tornado. Do you see the tornado?

1938
02:51:05,750 --> 02:51:07,750
No tornado sightings in the area.

1939
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:11,750
I'm pretty sure there's no tornadoes

1940
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:13,750
around here.

1941
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:15,750
Do you guys like organs?

1942
02:51:15,750 --> 02:51:17,750
No. Have you seen a bear or not?

1943
02:51:17,750 --> 02:51:19,750
I had a bear

1944
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:21,750
encounter yesterday.

1945
02:51:21,750 --> 02:51:23,750
You're a full day late.

1946
02:51:23,750 --> 02:51:25,750
I don't know.

1947
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:27,750
He's a bear.

1948
02:51:27,750 --> 02:51:29,750
He's a bear.

1949
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:31,750
You got a scent?

1950
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:33,750
I can smell him.

1951
02:51:33,750 --> 02:51:35,750
I think he went this way.

1952
02:51:35,750 --> 02:51:37,750
Nothing tricks this nose.

1953
02:51:37,750 --> 02:51:39,750
I can smell that bear.

1954
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:41,750
Why is everybody coming to my house?

1955
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:43,750
We'll find him. Listen, Sheriff

1956
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:45,750
Tony Andrews, if you need anything, give me a call

1957
02:51:45,750 --> 02:51:47,750
and pick up the trash.

1958
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:49,750
Let's keep the neighborhood nice.

1959
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:51,750
He beat a bear in a fight.

1960
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:53,750
Yes, I found a bear in a fight.

1961
02:51:53,750 --> 02:51:55,750
There was a tornado, and I got an organ.

1962
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:57,750
I knew I liked you.

1963
02:51:57,750 --> 02:51:59,750
I really liked you, but I didn't know you lived here.

1964
02:51:59,750 --> 02:52:01,750
I just live here. I was just walking by.

1965
02:52:01,750 --> 02:52:03,750
I don't mean to intrude or anything.

1966
02:52:03,750 --> 02:52:05,750
I just had a good time playing Battleship the other day.

1967
02:52:05,750 --> 02:52:07,750
You still owe me a lot from that.

1968
02:52:07,750 --> 02:52:09,750
I do. I have quite a few things.

1969
02:52:09,750 --> 02:52:11,750
I don't know how long.

1970
02:52:11,750 --> 02:52:13,750
I get to get in a shirt. I get to do a thing in a shirt

1971
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:15,750
T-shirt. Milky Maids.

1972
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:17,750
1500.

1973
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:19,750
If you ever wanted to play again, we could just sweep the debt.

1974
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:23,850
Maybe double or nothing.

1975
02:52:23,850 --> 02:52:25,850
Do you have another job here, by the way?

1976
02:52:25,850 --> 02:52:27,850
Oh, well...

1977
02:52:27,850 --> 02:52:29,850
Do you work here in the town?

1978
02:52:29,850 --> 02:52:31,850
I'm a streamer.

1979
02:52:31,850 --> 02:52:33,850
Do you work here as anything else?

1980
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:35,850
In this town?

1981
02:52:35,850 --> 02:52:37,850
Do you clean houses or anything?

1982
02:52:37,850 --> 02:52:39,850
Do you think my stream is not successful enough?

1983
02:52:39,850 --> 02:52:41,850
No, no, no.

1984
02:52:41,850 --> 02:52:43,850
I stream like a month in a row.

1985
02:52:43,850 --> 02:52:45,850
It was a long time.

1986
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:47,850
I know.

1987
02:52:47,850 --> 02:52:49,850
It was great.

1988
02:52:49,850 --> 02:52:51,850
You don't do anything else in this town?

1989
02:52:51,850 --> 02:52:53,850
Again, I just stream.

1990
02:52:53,850 --> 02:52:55,850
All right, whatever. I won't even push it anymore.

1991
02:52:55,850 --> 02:52:57,850
So you're talking about

1992
02:52:57,850 --> 02:52:59,850
we could play what?

1993
02:52:59,850 --> 02:53:01,850
We could play Battleship?

1994
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:04,979
Yeah, if you ever wanted to. Why do you have bread on the floor?

1995
02:53:04,979 --> 02:53:06,979
I'm supposed to have it made.

1996
02:53:06,979 --> 02:53:08,979
You just ate it out of the ground.

1997
02:53:08,979 --> 02:53:13,909
Should I follow you?

1998
02:53:13,909 --> 02:53:15,909
Come on in the other room.

1999
02:53:15,909 --> 02:53:17,909
Come on in the other room.

2000
02:53:17,909 --> 02:53:19,909
Wow! This is your stream setup.

2001
02:53:19,909 --> 02:53:21,909
This is my setup, man. Check it out.

2002
02:53:21,909 --> 02:53:23,909
That's convenient to have two chairs for co-op.

2003
02:53:23,909 --> 02:53:25,909
Yeah.

2004
02:53:25,909 --> 02:53:27,909
I could look out. This is good.

2005
02:53:27,909 --> 02:53:29,909
You could watch me stream if you wanted to.

2006
02:53:29,909 --> 02:53:31,909
This is a good setup.

2007
02:53:31,909 --> 02:53:33,909
By the way, it's cleaned very well from whoever that person happens to be

2008
02:53:33,909 --> 02:53:35,909
that comes and cleans the house every so often.

2009
02:53:35,909 --> 02:53:37,909
A maid?

2010
02:53:37,909 --> 02:53:39,909
Is it a guy or a girl?

2011
02:53:39,909 --> 02:53:41,909
It's you.

2012
02:53:41,909 --> 02:53:43,909
Sexy?

2013
02:53:43,909 --> 02:53:45,909
It would be you.

2014
02:53:45,909 --> 02:53:47,909
I think it's you.

2015
02:53:47,909 --> 02:53:49,909
Are we co-op streaming?

2016
02:53:49,909 --> 02:53:51,909
Do you want me to do your intro?

2017
02:53:51,909 --> 02:53:53,909
Sometimes I get nervous before a stream.

2018
02:53:56,860 --> 02:53:58,860
Let's try to start the stream.

2019
02:53:58,860 --> 02:54:01,350
Just go live.

2020
02:54:01,350 --> 02:54:03,350
What's up, suckers?

2021
02:54:03,350 --> 02:54:05,350
It's not live yet.

2022
02:54:05,350 --> 02:54:07,350
I'm a little nervous when I do co-ops in person.

2023
02:54:07,350 --> 02:54:09,350
It won't go through.

2024
02:54:09,350 --> 02:54:11,350
I'm banned from Twitch.

2025
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:13,350
Why did you get banned?

2026
02:54:15,659 --> 02:54:17,659
Do you see where I stream from?

2027
02:54:17,659 --> 02:54:19,659
Yeah.

2028
02:54:19,659 --> 02:54:21,659
This reminds me of another doctor streamer.

2029
02:54:21,659 --> 02:54:23,659
You know.

2030
02:54:23,659 --> 02:54:25,659
If you can make it work, you can make it work.

2031
02:54:25,659 --> 02:54:28,149
I'm going to fall out of the thing.

2032
02:54:30,149 --> 02:54:32,149
This has been a bit eye-opening, man.

2033
02:54:32,149 --> 02:54:34,149
I didn't know that you lived here.

2034
02:54:34,149 --> 02:54:36,149
I didn't know that you lived like this.

2035
02:54:38,149 --> 02:54:40,149
You've got to have your setup in a good place, right?

2036
02:54:40,149 --> 02:54:42,149
No, that's what I agree with.

2037
02:54:42,149 --> 02:54:44,149
I think we disagree on

2038
02:54:44,149 --> 02:54:46,149
how you accomplished that.

2039
02:54:46,149 --> 02:54:48,149
I've got to shower, too, if you feel

2040
02:54:48,149 --> 02:54:50,149
you need to take a shower or anything.

2041
02:54:50,149 --> 02:54:52,149
Anything you bring up that you have.

2042
02:54:52,149 --> 02:54:54,899
It's assumed.

2043
02:54:54,899 --> 02:54:56,899
Yeah, but in case you needed to, it's there.

2044
02:54:56,899 --> 02:54:58,899
Oh, homemade cookies.

2045
02:54:58,899 --> 02:55:00,899
There are cookies.

2046
02:55:00,899 --> 02:55:03,270
Oh, and what do you got here?

2047
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:09,180
You want to play?

2048
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:11,180
No.

2049
02:55:11,180 --> 02:55:13,180
I've been waiting for your arrival for months, even though I didn't even know you lived here.

2050
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:15,180
I have Mickey

2051
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:17,180
weird mouse

2052
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:19,180
cartoon gloves on.

2053
02:55:19,180 --> 02:55:21,180
Can you go ahead and open that for me?

2054
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:23,180
I'll open it for you.

2055
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:25,180
Let's get this moved out of the way.

2056
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:27,180
Sorry, I've got to piss really bad.

2057
02:55:27,180 --> 02:55:29,180
You take your time. I'll set it up.

2058
02:55:29,180 --> 02:55:31,180
I don't have to go quite yet.

2059
02:55:31,180 --> 02:55:33,180
Why would you bring it up to me?

2060
02:55:33,180 --> 02:55:35,180
Just in case for you to know in the future that I'm going to have to go eventually.

2061
02:55:35,180 --> 02:55:37,180
Thank you for the information.

2062
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:39,180
I also will have to pee in the future.

2063
02:55:39,180 --> 02:55:41,180
There's a bathroom there, too.

2064
02:55:41,180 --> 02:55:43,180
I don't know when.

2065
02:55:43,180 --> 02:55:45,180
Should I set up your board for you?

2066
02:55:45,180 --> 02:55:47,180
I think you should, because I can't touch it.

2067
02:55:47,180 --> 02:55:49,180
I made cookies

2068
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:51,180
with this woman. Do you know Edna?

2069
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:53,180
Oh, Edna?

2070
02:55:53,180 --> 02:55:55,180
Isn't she great?

2071
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:57,180
She's a cool chef, but she's a little weird, though.

2072
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:59,180
Well, like weird in a good way, you know?

2073
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:01,180
I got it for you.

2074
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:03,180
Yeah, I can't even

2075
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:05,180
touch that.

2076
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:07,180
I think this is how it goes.

2077
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:09,180
This looks much more complicated

2078
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:11,180
than I thought it was going to be.

2079
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:13,180
I was thinking, since you owe me about $500,

2080
02:56:13,180 --> 02:56:15,180
we could just do a simple

2081
02:56:15,180 --> 02:56:17,180
You want to do two ships?

2082
02:56:17,180 --> 02:56:19,180
Two ships. Maybe even just one.

2083
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:21,180
One ship.

2084
02:56:21,180 --> 02:56:23,180
Just a two-piece ship.

2085
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:25,180
I can't get this other glove off because it's taped to my wrist.

2086
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:27,180
You know what?

2087
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:29,180
It's taped.

2088
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,180
It's a great watch, though.

2089
02:56:31,180 --> 02:56:33,180
It is a really nice watch. Am I flexing enough?

2090
02:56:33,180 --> 02:56:35,180
Do you know that I make pretty good money?

2091
02:56:35,180 --> 02:56:37,180
Do you know that I make good money?

2092
02:56:37,180 --> 02:56:39,180
I saw your last stream, you know.

2093
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:41,180
You missed a day.

2094
02:56:41,180 --> 02:56:43,180
Insistency is key.

2095
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:45,180
You make great money.

2096
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:47,180
I don't want you to see my screen.

2097
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:49,180
Charming place. I'm not cheating.

2098
02:56:49,180 --> 02:56:51,180
Just place one ship.

2099
02:56:51,180 --> 02:56:53,180
We're doing one ship?

2100
02:56:53,180 --> 02:56:55,180
Just one ship, yeah.

2101
02:56:55,180 --> 02:56:58,629
You're not looking, right? I'm not looking.

2102
02:56:58,629 --> 02:57:00,629
I got my ship placed.

2103
02:57:00,629 --> 02:57:02,629
Do you have your ship placed? I do.

2104
02:57:02,629 --> 02:57:04,629
Are you starting this off?

2105
02:57:04,629 --> 02:57:06,629
Yeah, I'm going to say

2106
02:57:06,629 --> 02:57:08,629
C5.

2107
02:57:08,629 --> 02:57:10,629
Just be so incorrect.

2108
02:57:10,629 --> 02:57:13,319
So incorrect, it's a miss.

2109
02:57:13,319 --> 02:57:15,319
This is $500 on the line.

2110
02:57:15,319 --> 02:57:17,319
What are we doing with some money?

2111
02:57:17,319 --> 02:57:19,319
You owe me money. This is a double or nothing.

2112
02:57:19,319 --> 02:57:21,500
Okay, fine.

2113
02:57:21,500 --> 02:57:23,500
Now I'm fine with it. You can make a lot.

2114
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:25,500
I didn't even know you lived here.

2115
02:57:25,500 --> 02:57:27,500
So C5 is a miss.

2116
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:29,500
I will go with C5 as well.

2117
02:57:29,500 --> 02:57:33,399
You're doing C5? It's a miss.

2118
02:57:33,399 --> 02:57:35,399
I don't like the aesthetic here.

2119
02:57:35,399 --> 02:57:37,399
Can you scoot to your left by like 3 or 4

2120
02:57:37,399 --> 02:57:39,399
inches here a little more?

2121
02:57:39,399 --> 02:57:41,399
There we go. I like that. I like the aesthetic there a little more.

2122
02:57:41,399 --> 02:57:43,399
Is that a bit better? That's a bit better to me.

2123
02:57:43,399 --> 02:57:45,399
I just have to think about the way you were sitting.

2124
02:57:45,399 --> 02:57:47,399
It bothered you. It bothered me very much.

2125
02:57:47,399 --> 02:57:49,399
That's fair. So you said C5?

2126
02:57:49,399 --> 02:57:51,399
Yeah, C5. Okay, it's a miss.

2127
02:57:51,399 --> 02:57:53,399
I'm going to say, you can literally see me.

2128
02:57:53,399 --> 02:57:55,399
No, I can't see anything. You can see.

2129
02:57:55,399 --> 02:57:57,399
I'm going to say F7.

2130
02:57:57,399 --> 02:58:00,409
Incredibly incorrect.

2131
02:58:00,409 --> 02:58:02,409
Okay.

2132
02:58:02,409 --> 02:58:05,100
Fine. Where are you going?

2133
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:07,100
Maybe like something in the

2134
02:58:07,100 --> 02:58:09,100
first column.

2135
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:11,100
Okay.

2136
02:58:11,100 --> 02:58:13,100
Well, you have to say something.

2137
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:15,100
D, maybe C1.

2138
02:58:15,100 --> 02:58:17,590
C1 is a hit.

2139
02:58:17,590 --> 02:58:19,590
It's a hit? Yeah, and you literally looked.

2140
02:58:19,590 --> 02:58:21,590
No, I wouldn't do that.

2141
02:58:21,590 --> 02:58:23,590
I'd like move to your left and he's like, oh sure.

2142
02:58:23,590 --> 02:58:25,590
You asked me to move to my left. I just happened to move to my left.

2143
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:27,590
You literally can see. I'm just going to take a random stab

2144
02:58:27,590 --> 02:58:29,590
in the dark. D1.

2145
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:31,590
No. What?

2146
02:58:31,590 --> 02:58:33,590
There's something on D1.

2147
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:35,829
First of all, I want to do this real quick.

2148
02:58:35,829 --> 02:58:37,829
Don't move. Okay.

2149
02:58:37,829 --> 02:58:40,579
Here, I want everyone to see what I have.

2150
02:58:40,579 --> 02:58:42,579
Show them what I have.

2151
02:58:42,579 --> 02:58:44,579
If you ever have to go to the bathroom and take a shower, feel free to.

2152
02:58:44,579 --> 02:58:46,579
That's where I am and he looked and it's bullshit.

2153
02:58:46,579 --> 02:58:48,579
I've never looked at anything in my life.

2154
02:58:48,579 --> 02:58:50,760
Call me a cheater?

2155
02:58:50,760 --> 02:58:52,760
Yes.

2156
02:58:52,760 --> 02:58:54,760
So when did you move here?

2157
02:58:54,760 --> 02:58:56,760
At 983 Dollhouse Lane.

2158
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:58,760
983 Dollhouse Lane. I've been living at Dollhouse Lane

2159
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:00,760
for a while actually.

2160
02:59:00,760 --> 02:59:02,760
I was with my mother.

2161
02:59:02,760 --> 02:59:04,760
I was friends with a man named Ted. Passed recently.

2162
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:07,639
Sad passing too.

2163
02:59:07,639 --> 02:59:09,639
Came out of nowhere.

2164
02:59:09,639 --> 02:59:11,639
Blindsided us all.

2165
02:59:11,639 --> 02:59:13,639
You weren't there.

2166
02:59:13,639 --> 02:59:15,639
No.

2167
02:59:15,639 --> 02:59:17,639
No, I wasn't.

2168
02:59:17,639 --> 02:59:19,639
I didn't think I had to be there.

2169
02:59:19,639 --> 02:59:21,639
It was very clear.

2170
02:59:21,639 --> 02:59:23,639
You would be your uncle too.

2171
02:59:23,639 --> 02:59:25,639
We would be literally like brothers.

2172
02:59:25,639 --> 02:59:27,639
My mom is not related.

2173
02:59:27,639 --> 02:59:29,639
You and I are not related at all?

2174
02:59:29,639 --> 02:59:31,639
No, my mom is just friends with him.

2175
02:59:31,639 --> 02:59:33,639
I'm going to go F3.

2176
02:59:33,639 --> 02:59:35,639
F3 is just going to be a miss on your end.

2177
02:59:35,639 --> 02:59:37,639
That's fine.

2178
02:59:37,639 --> 02:59:40,709
You don't have to pee yet or anything, right?

2179
02:59:40,709 --> 02:59:42,709
I have had to pee for the last hour.

2180
02:59:42,709 --> 02:59:44,709
I've had to pee for the last hour but I'm just going to hold it

2181
02:59:44,709 --> 02:59:46,709
because I like talking to you.

2182
02:59:46,709 --> 02:59:48,709
Okay, okay.

2183
02:59:48,709 --> 02:59:50,709
Let me go with E1.

2184
02:59:50,709 --> 02:59:52,709
E1 is incorrect.

2185
02:59:52,709 --> 02:59:54,709
You already said that last time.

2186
02:59:54,709 --> 02:59:56,709
No, I said D1.

2187
02:59:56,709 --> 02:59:58,709
Oh, well you were wrong twice.

2188
02:59:58,709 --> 03:00:02,100
Where do you want to go instead?

2189
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:04,100
You know what?

2190
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:06,100
I'll go D2.

2191
03:00:06,100 --> 03:00:08,100
D2? That is a miss.

2192
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:10,100
You already have a hit.

2193
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:12,100
Hold on, I've got to get this.

2194
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:14,280
Who is calling right now?

2195
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:21,239
Hello?

2196
03:00:21,239 --> 03:00:23,239
It's just static. I don't know who this is.

2197
03:00:23,239 --> 03:00:26,180
No, I don't know.

2198
03:00:26,180 --> 03:00:36,219
Hello? Hello?

2199
03:00:36,219 --> 03:00:39,219
What the fuck?

2200
03:00:39,219 --> 03:00:41,219
It was a prank call.

2201
03:00:41,219 --> 03:00:43,219
It could have been a prank call.

2202
03:00:43,219 --> 03:00:45,219
Hold on, somebody's there.

2203
03:00:45,219 --> 03:00:47,850
We have a final courtesy call.

2204
03:00:47,850 --> 03:00:49,850
Before we close out your file,

2205
03:00:49,850 --> 03:00:51,850
I wanted to see if you were available

2206
03:00:51,850 --> 03:00:53,850
to talk for a few minutes.

2207
03:00:53,850 --> 03:00:55,850
I'm not available to talk.

2208
03:00:55,850 --> 03:00:57,850
If you're a specialist concerning extending

2209
03:00:57,850 --> 03:00:59,850
or reinstating your vehicle's

2210
03:00:59,850 --> 03:01:01,850
warranty, press 1 right now

2211
03:01:01,850 --> 03:01:03,850
to speak to a warranty specialist.

2212
03:01:03,850 --> 03:01:05,850
I'd like for you to put me on the do not call list.

2213
03:01:05,850 --> 03:01:07,850
That's what I would appreciate. Thank you.

2214
03:01:07,850 --> 03:01:09,850
Put me on the do not call list, ever again.

2215
03:01:09,850 --> 03:01:11,850
And I know what that means is that means you're going to take this,

2216
03:01:11,850 --> 03:01:13,850
you're going to put me in a database of people that answered the phone

2217
03:01:13,850 --> 03:01:15,850
so therefore I'm going to get 10 times more phone calls.

2218
03:01:15,850 --> 03:01:17,850
The real play is for me to never actually

2219
03:01:17,850 --> 03:01:19,850
answer the phone, because if I answer the phone

2220
03:01:19,850 --> 03:01:21,850
that means they have me in the database of people that answered the phone

2221
03:01:21,850 --> 03:01:23,850
so therefore I'll get more.

2222
03:01:23,850 --> 03:01:25,850
Have a good day. Fuck you.

2223
03:01:25,850 --> 03:01:28,409
What was your move?

2224
03:01:28,409 --> 03:01:30,409
It was...

2225
03:01:30,409 --> 03:01:32,409
C4, like the explosive.

2226
03:01:32,409 --> 03:01:34,409
That's a hit.

2227
03:01:34,409 --> 03:01:36,409
What?

2228
03:01:36,409 --> 03:01:38,409
C3.

2229
03:01:38,409 --> 03:01:40,409
That's a hit.

2230
03:01:40,409 --> 03:01:42,409
C2.

2231
03:01:42,409 --> 03:01:44,840
That's a hit. You won again.

2232
03:01:44,840 --> 03:01:46,840
I have to pay $500.

2233
03:01:46,840 --> 03:01:48,840
That's $500.

2234
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:50,840
This is just for fun.

2235
03:01:50,840 --> 03:01:52,840
That's just for fun.

2236
03:01:52,840 --> 03:01:54,840
I guessed it correctly.

2237
03:01:54,840 --> 03:01:56,840
You guessed it correctly, but you didn't even...

2238
03:01:56,840 --> 03:01:58,840
Hold on.

2239
03:01:58,840 --> 03:02:01,209
Sorry, I've just really got to go to the bathroom.

2240
03:02:01,209 --> 03:02:03,209
Yeah, take your time.

2241
03:02:03,209 --> 03:02:05,209
I've got to go to the bathroom.

2242
03:02:05,209 --> 03:02:07,209
Well, I can't go yet.

2243
03:02:07,209 --> 03:02:09,639
But I have to go.

2244
03:02:09,639 --> 03:02:12,260
I didn't think it would be like this when we hung out.

2245
03:02:12,260 --> 03:02:14,260
I didn't even know you lived here. I thought you lived somewhere.

2246
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:16,260
I didn't know you lived here.

2247
03:02:16,260 --> 03:02:18,260
I've always lived in Dollhouse.

2248
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:20,260
You walked over and I was doing my thing, playing the organ

2249
03:02:20,260 --> 03:02:22,260
and I didn't know you were here.

2250
03:02:22,260 --> 03:02:24,260
You're weirdos, by the way. Is it police?

2251
03:02:24,260 --> 03:02:26,260
It's the police. There's been a bear on the loose.

2252
03:02:26,260 --> 03:02:28,260
Have you had a bear in your house?

2253
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:30,260
Well, before, yeah.

2254
03:02:30,260 --> 03:02:32,260
You've had a bear come to your front door?

2255
03:02:32,260 --> 03:02:34,260
Before, yeah.

2256
03:02:34,260 --> 03:02:36,260
What did you do?

2257
03:02:36,260 --> 03:02:38,260
Well, the rational thing, I called the cops.

2258
03:02:38,260 --> 03:02:40,260
What else would you do?

2259
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:42,260
What would you do?

2260
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:44,260
I would call the police.

2261
03:02:44,260 --> 03:02:46,260
But I fought him and I kicked his ass.

2262
03:02:46,260 --> 03:02:48,260
What?

2263
03:02:48,260 --> 03:02:50,260
And then he kicked my ass.

2264
03:02:50,260 --> 03:02:54,260
Okay, you're saying it with a tone that makes me think you might not have.

2265
03:02:54,260 --> 03:02:56,260
I'll be right back.

2266
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:58,260
Take your time.

2267
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:00,260
Just hang out this food in the fridge, this pecan sandwich I made.

2268
03:03:00,260 --> 03:03:05,959
Yeah, sure.

2269
03:03:05,959 --> 03:03:16,459
Ludwig is in my house right now.

2270
03:03:16,459 --> 03:03:18,819
He's awesome.

2271
03:03:18,819 --> 03:03:20,819
He's like a huge streamer.

2272
03:03:20,819 --> 03:03:23,379
He's like fucking really funny and shit.

2273
03:03:23,379 --> 03:03:28,360
I wasn't prepared for this.

2274
03:03:28,360 --> 03:03:30,360
I got a piece so fucking bad you have no idea.

2275
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:39,620
Please help me.

2276
03:03:39,620 --> 03:03:43,459
Please. I'll do anything.

2277
03:03:43,459 --> 03:03:45,459
Please let me go to the bathroom.

2278
03:03:45,459 --> 03:03:50,840
Hey!

2279
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:53,850
Hey!

2280
03:03:53,850 --> 03:03:55,850
How are you?

2281
03:03:55,850 --> 03:03:57,850
I'm doing good.

2282
03:03:57,850 --> 03:03:59,850
He's doing good. Awesome.

2283
03:03:59,850 --> 03:04:01,850
How are you doing?

2284
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:03,850
I'm doing great. It's good to have you here, man.

2285
03:04:03,850 --> 03:04:05,850
It's really good to have you here.

2286
03:04:05,850 --> 03:04:07,850
You seem on edge.

2287
03:04:07,850 --> 03:04:09,850
Yeah.

2288
03:04:09,850 --> 03:04:11,850
You want something to drink?

2289
03:04:11,850 --> 03:04:34,940
No, I'm fine.

2290
03:04:34,940 --> 03:04:36,940
Ludwig!

2291
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:38,940
There's stereo in here. I'm listening to weird music.

2292
03:04:38,940 --> 03:04:45,079
No, I get that.

2293
03:04:45,079 --> 03:04:47,079
Listen to drum solos.

2294
03:04:47,079 --> 03:04:49,079
It kind of feels like you're trying to drum over the sound of your shitting,

2295
03:04:49,079 --> 03:04:51,079
but that makes sense too.

2296
03:04:51,079 --> 03:04:53,079
It's drum solos.

2297
03:04:53,079 --> 03:04:55,079
Why is the paper this far away?

2298
03:04:55,079 --> 03:04:57,319
Why would the paper be over here?

2299
03:05:03,319 --> 03:05:05,319
This guy's a bit of a psycho.

2300
03:05:05,319 --> 03:05:10,760
Thank God.

2301
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:14,409
That paper is like three feet away.

2302
03:05:14,409 --> 03:05:24,260
Hands washed.

2303
03:05:24,260 --> 03:05:33,219
Ludwig, how are you?

2304
03:05:33,219 --> 03:05:35,530
How are you doing?

2305
03:05:35,530 --> 03:05:37,530
You've done this a couple times.

2306
03:05:37,530 --> 03:05:39,530
I'm doing good.

2307
03:05:39,530 --> 03:05:41,530
I don't want to stay too long.

2308
03:05:41,530 --> 03:05:43,530
It seems like you've got a lot of shit going on.

2309
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:45,530
No, not really.

2310
03:05:45,530 --> 03:05:47,530
Just a few things.

2311
03:05:47,530 --> 03:05:49,530
I'm really happy you came over. I hope you like the place.

2312
03:05:49,530 --> 03:05:52,729
It's cool.

2313
03:05:52,729 --> 03:05:54,729
It's all right.

2314
03:05:54,729 --> 03:05:56,729
It's a low mortgage.

2315
03:05:56,729 --> 03:05:58,729
I got it on a good deal.

2316
03:05:58,729 --> 03:06:00,729
Yeah.

2317
03:06:00,729 --> 03:06:02,729
You got a beer?

2318
03:06:02,729 --> 03:06:04,729
Is that okay?

2319
03:06:04,729 --> 03:06:06,729
I'm just going to help myself.

2320
03:06:06,729 --> 03:06:08,729
It's cool, man.

2321
03:06:08,729 --> 03:06:11,100
I don't want to...

2322
03:06:11,100 --> 03:06:13,100
It's all good, man.

2323
03:06:13,100 --> 03:06:17,100
Sometimes I just got to fucking get some blood pumping.

2324
03:06:17,100 --> 03:06:19,100
Sorry.

2325
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:21,780
Do I do it with you?

2326
03:06:21,780 --> 03:06:23,780
You can if you want to.

2327
03:06:23,780 --> 03:06:25,780
Sometimes I just feel like doing it because I feel like I've got to get some blood going in my body.

2328
03:06:25,780 --> 03:06:27,780
Maybe you could move this to not be in the middle.

2329
03:06:27,780 --> 03:06:29,780
That would be a workout.

2330
03:06:29,780 --> 03:06:31,780
I can't get swole that way.

2331
03:06:31,780 --> 03:06:33,780
Right.

2332
03:06:33,780 --> 03:06:35,780
That makes a lot of sense.

2333
03:06:35,780 --> 03:06:37,780
It does.

2334
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:39,780
Hey, it's been a pleasure.

2335
03:06:39,780 --> 03:06:41,780
It's been wonderful.

2336
03:06:41,780 --> 03:06:43,780
How many times do I have to pay you every time I see you?

2337
03:06:43,780 --> 03:06:45,780
Don't want to be too forward.

2338
03:06:45,780 --> 03:06:47,780
Maybe it's worth getting a maid around these parts.

2339
03:06:47,780 --> 03:06:49,780
I know. I thought about that.

2340
03:06:49,780 --> 03:06:51,780
Weirdly enough, though.

2341
03:06:51,780 --> 03:06:53,780
Maids are like two grand around here.

2342
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:55,780
Well, the sexy ones.

2343
03:06:55,780 --> 03:06:57,780
You wouldn't get those ones.

2344
03:06:57,780 --> 03:06:59,780
Those are the maids that are like happy ending maids.

2345
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:01,780
Two grand, though. It's a little high.

2346
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:03,780
Well, it's a good ending.

2347
03:07:03,780 --> 03:07:05,780
End of Code Geass levels.

2348
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:07,780
It's a little high.

2349
03:07:07,780 --> 03:07:09,780
It's a little high.

2350
03:07:09,780 --> 03:07:11,780
Okay.

2351
03:07:11,780 --> 03:07:13,780
You okay?

2352
03:07:13,780 --> 03:07:15,780
Yeah, I'm fine.

2353
03:07:15,780 --> 03:07:17,780
I'll just get my socks on.

2354
03:07:17,780 --> 03:07:19,780
I'll just see myself out.

2355
03:07:19,780 --> 03:07:21,780
I'll just get my socks on.

2356
03:07:21,780 --> 03:07:23,780
Hey, it was great seeing you.

2357
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:25,780
I'll just get my socks on.

2358
03:07:25,780 --> 03:07:27,780
I'll just get my socks on.

2359
03:07:27,780 --> 03:07:29,780
This guy's a fucking psycho.

2360
03:07:29,780 --> 03:07:41,540
Ahh.

2361
03:07:41,540 --> 03:07:46,600
I can't sleep.

2362
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:49,159
Why?

2363
03:07:49,159 --> 03:07:51,159
That was so fucking embarrassing.

2364
03:07:51,159 --> 03:07:54,229
He's like really cool.

2365
03:07:54,229 --> 03:07:56,229
That's like you literally just brought in

2366
03:07:56,229 --> 03:07:58,920
one of the coolest dudes I know.

2367
03:07:58,920 --> 03:08:00,920
I'm trying to sleep.

2368
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:05,719
I'm so tired, but I can't.

2369
03:08:05,719 --> 03:08:08,149
Why?

2370
03:08:08,149 --> 03:08:10,899
Why can't I sleep?

2371
03:08:10,899 --> 03:16:58,250
I don't...

2372
03:16:58,250 --> 03:17:03,739
It's raining. It's really raining.

2373
03:17:03,739 --> 03:17:05,739
It's like loud rain.

2374
03:17:05,739 --> 03:17:10,090
It's like a thunderstorm.

2375
03:17:10,090 --> 03:17:14,629
Oh, whoa.

2376
03:17:14,629 --> 03:17:16,870
Whoa.

2377
03:17:16,870 --> 03:17:19,430
Whoa, TV.

2378
03:17:19,430 --> 03:17:21,430
TV.

2379
03:17:21,430 --> 03:17:28,969
Does it work?

2380
03:17:28,969 --> 03:17:33,579
TV? How do I turn it on?

2381
03:17:33,579 --> 03:17:39,399
Holy shit.

2382
03:17:39,399 --> 03:17:43,159
A TV.

2383
03:17:43,159 --> 03:17:45,159
If I can turn it on.

2384
03:17:45,159 --> 03:17:50,579
Where is it?

2385
03:17:50,579 --> 03:17:53,659
Where is the TV?

2386
03:17:53,659 --> 03:17:55,659
How do I turn it on?

2387
03:17:55,659 --> 03:17:57,659
The rain is so loud.

2388
03:17:57,659 --> 03:18:00,340
TV.

2389
03:18:00,340 --> 03:18:02,340
Oh, cool. TV.

2390
03:18:02,340 --> 03:18:04,709
Oh, whoa.

2391
03:18:04,709 --> 03:18:08,299
Wow.

2392
03:18:08,299 --> 03:18:15,319
TV.

2393
03:18:15,319 --> 03:18:17,319
How do I turn

2394
03:18:17,319 --> 03:18:19,559
the TV off?

2395
03:18:19,559 --> 03:18:21,559
Oh, cool.

2396
03:18:21,559 --> 03:18:24,309
TV.

2397
03:18:24,309 --> 03:18:27,190
Wow. Oh, my God.

2398
03:18:27,190 --> 03:18:29,559
TV.

2399
03:18:29,559 --> 03:18:32,889
TV.

2400
03:18:32,889 --> 03:18:34,889
Oh, wow. TV.

2401
03:18:34,889 --> 03:18:44,739
TV.

2402
03:18:44,739 --> 03:18:47,940
TV.

2403
03:18:47,940 --> 03:18:51,020
Shit's fucked.

2404
03:18:51,020 --> 03:18:53,020
Why don't we watch some TV?

2405
03:18:53,020 --> 03:18:55,639
Oh,

2406
03:18:55,639 --> 03:18:57,639
the beautiful rainstorm.

2407
03:18:57,639 --> 03:19:01,909
Take a look outside.

2408
03:19:01,909 --> 03:19:04,729
Wow.

2409
03:19:04,729 --> 03:19:07,420
It's coming down out there.

2410
03:19:07,420 --> 03:19:09,420
Holy smokes.

2411
03:19:09,420 --> 03:19:28,860
Time to stream.

2412
03:19:28,860 --> 03:19:35,700
Let's get some stream going here.

2413
03:19:35,700 --> 03:19:37,700
All right, going live.

2414
03:19:37,700 --> 03:19:41,420
Check me out.

2415
03:19:41,420 --> 03:19:46,540
And live.

2416
03:19:46,540 --> 03:19:48,540
Hey, guys. Just started the stream.

2417
03:19:48,540 --> 03:19:52,760
But before I get started,

2418
03:19:52,760 --> 03:24:52,979
let's run some ads.

2419
03:24:52,979 --> 03:24:56,500
No, I don't see it.

2420
03:24:56,500 --> 03:25:00,979
It's not on the screen, is what you're saying.

2421
03:25:00,979 --> 03:25:02,979
Thanks for the subs. Appreciate it.

2422
03:25:02,979 --> 03:25:04,979
It's not there, though. I'm not blind. I can't see it.

2423
03:25:04,979 --> 03:25:13,290
There's nothing there.

2424
03:25:13,290 --> 03:25:15,290
There's nothing on the screen.

2425
03:25:15,290 --> 03:25:17,290
I've turned around four

2426
03:25:17,290 --> 03:25:19,530
times now, okay?

2427
03:25:19,530 --> 03:25:21,899
I'm not there.

2428
03:25:21,899 --> 03:25:23,899
Stop fucking with me. I'm just getting, like, gaslit.

2429
03:25:23,899 --> 03:25:30,229
That's all you guys fucking do.

2430
03:25:30,229 --> 03:25:32,229
I don't know if that's somebody's officers,

2431
03:25:32,229 --> 03:25:40,979
police officers driving by or something.

2432
03:25:40,979 --> 03:25:44,819
Yeah. No, that was a siren.

2433
03:25:44,819 --> 03:25:46,819
I don't know. That's a main road. It's a busy road.

2434
03:25:46,819 --> 03:25:56,469
Yeah, I got it.

2435
03:25:56,469 --> 03:25:58,469
Ring the doorbell or something.

2436
03:25:58,469 --> 03:26:00,469
Ring the doorbell.

2437
03:26:00,469 --> 03:26:02,709
I gotta go.

2438
03:26:02,709 --> 03:26:04,709
It's hard to do. I'm freaking blind.

2439
03:26:04,709 --> 03:26:06,709
Can you knock it a couple times? Do something, okay?

2440
03:26:06,709 --> 03:26:08,709
I'm freaking

2441
03:26:08,709 --> 03:26:10,709
pretty sure this is the right place.

2442
03:26:10,709 --> 03:26:12,709
I'm pretty sure. All right, let me show you how it's done, all right?

2443
03:26:12,709 --> 03:26:17,319
Hey, listen, this is

2444
03:26:17,319 --> 03:26:19,319
Sheriff Tony Andrews, I believe we met.

2445
03:26:19,319 --> 03:26:21,319
Yeah, we have. I have some complaints

2446
03:26:21,319 --> 03:26:23,319
about a stolen TV in the

2447
03:26:23,319 --> 03:26:25,319
area, and the GPS tracking device

2448
03:26:25,319 --> 03:26:27,319
is showing right here. Yeah,

2449
03:26:27,319 --> 03:26:29,319
the GPS tracking device. Yeah, what's that?

2450
03:26:29,319 --> 03:26:31,319
It's raining.

2451
03:26:31,319 --> 03:26:33,319
Interesting. Well, listen,

2452
03:26:33,319 --> 03:26:35,319
listen, you're gonna have to let us in here, okay? We gotta inspect

2453
03:26:35,319 --> 03:26:37,319
the area. It's raining. Can you see that?

2454
03:26:37,319 --> 03:26:39,319
How are you guys out here in the rain? Wait, is it

2455
03:26:39,319 --> 03:26:41,319
raining right here? Yeah, it's raining just in that spot. I'm perfectly fine.

2456
03:26:41,319 --> 03:26:43,319
Yeah, that's

2457
03:26:43,319 --> 03:26:45,319
a stolen what? Yeah, you see

2458
03:26:45,319 --> 03:26:47,319
that stolen TV? My GPS says it's

2459
03:26:47,319 --> 03:26:49,319
right at this location, right? 985

2460
03:26:49,319 --> 03:26:51,319
Dollhouse Road. How do you have a GPS on

2461
03:26:51,319 --> 03:26:53,319
what is stolen? Everything has

2462
03:26:53,319 --> 03:26:55,319
tracking devices. We gotta go

2463
03:26:55,319 --> 03:26:57,319
in here, we gotta go in here. Do I seriously go

2464
03:26:57,319 --> 03:26:59,319
inside, dude? Who is this guy? He's

2465
03:26:59,319 --> 03:27:01,319
a serial jaywalker.

2466
03:27:01,319 --> 03:27:03,319
I caught him loitering outside the library

2467
03:27:03,319 --> 03:27:06,069
a couple minutes ago. Listen, dude,

2468
03:27:06,069 --> 03:27:08,069
you can just call me Snakebite.

2469
03:27:08,069 --> 03:27:10,250
Why is, why are you bringing him in my house?

2470
03:27:10,250 --> 03:27:13,940
What's that? It's a TV.

2471
03:27:13,940 --> 03:27:15,940
You see this, you see that red dot?

2472
03:27:15,940 --> 03:27:20,170
Yeah. You see that TV?

2473
03:27:20,170 --> 03:27:22,170
Where'd you get that TV? That TV was 50 bucks.

2474
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:24,170
I got it from second hand. It was second hand.

2475
03:27:24,170 --> 03:27:26,170
And where'd you get it? Huh? Where'd you get that TV?

2476
03:27:26,170 --> 03:27:28,170
I got it from, it was brought to me by some

2477
03:27:28,170 --> 03:27:30,170
sleep paralysis demons in the night. Sleep

2478
03:27:30,170 --> 03:27:32,170
paralysis demons, yeah, okay.

2479
03:27:32,170 --> 03:27:34,170
Tell me more about your sleep

2480
03:27:34,170 --> 03:27:36,170
paralysis demons. You got any

2481
03:27:36,170 --> 03:27:38,170
sleep paralysis demons?

2482
03:27:38,170 --> 03:27:40,170
Sleep paralysis, dude?

2483
03:27:40,170 --> 03:27:42,170
It's going down out there, you hear that?

2484
03:27:42,170 --> 03:27:44,170
I don't know what you, he's crazy.

2485
03:27:44,170 --> 03:27:46,170
You're a psycho, you know that?

2486
03:27:46,170 --> 03:27:48,170
You think it's raining, you got sleep

2487
03:27:48,170 --> 03:27:50,170
paralysis demons? What do you want

2488
03:27:50,170 --> 03:27:52,170
to do about the TV? What do you want to do about the TV?

2489
03:27:52,170 --> 03:27:54,170
Let me ask you something. You see that red dot?

2490
03:27:54,170 --> 03:27:56,659
You think that's that TV right there?

2491
03:27:56,659 --> 03:27:59,350
Officer, I don't want, I don't

2492
03:27:59,350 --> 03:28:01,350
want a criminal just in my house.

2493
03:28:01,350 --> 03:28:03,350
He hasn't actually officially been arrested yet.

2494
03:28:03,350 --> 03:28:05,350
That's a whole other story. Why is he handcuffed?

2495
03:28:05,350 --> 03:28:07,350
This is boring. Hold my phone.

2496
03:28:07,350 --> 03:28:09,350
Dude, this is crazy, man.

2497
03:28:09,350 --> 03:28:11,350
Let me just double check something, okay?

2498
03:28:11,350 --> 03:28:13,350
You can look if you want. I don't think

2499
03:28:13,350 --> 03:28:15,350
there's anything wrong. I mean the TV doesn't

2500
03:28:15,350 --> 03:28:19,260
work, it broke. Yeah, that's the

2501
03:28:19,260 --> 03:28:21,260
exact serial number with the GPS.

2502
03:28:21,260 --> 03:28:23,260
I didn't buy it. Somebody wanted it for me.

2503
03:28:23,260 --> 03:28:25,260
It came in here, sleep paralysis demons

2504
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:27,260
brings it to me and it's going to take my name in my bank account.

2505
03:28:27,260 --> 03:28:29,260
Do me a favor. I'm going to need you to help

2506
03:28:29,260 --> 03:28:31,260
me pick this up, alright? Oh yeah, sure.

2507
03:28:31,260 --> 03:28:33,260
I'm sorry, sir, this is stolen property.

2508
03:28:33,260 --> 03:28:35,260
Unless you want me to- You can't take my TV.

2509
03:28:35,260 --> 03:28:38,069
You want me to arrest you? It's your choice.

2510
03:28:38,069 --> 03:28:40,069
You know. You can't take this TV.

2511
03:28:40,069 --> 03:28:42,069
Okay, listen, you want him to take the TV?

2512
03:28:42,069 --> 03:28:44,069
I don't want anyone to take my TV.

2513
03:28:44,069 --> 03:28:46,069
This is my TV. It was brought to me by the sleep paralysis

2514
03:28:46,069 --> 03:28:48,069
demons and they gave it to me in the night time

2515
03:28:48,069 --> 03:28:50,069
and they dropped shit and they touched my head

2516
03:28:50,069 --> 03:28:52,069
sometimes.

2517
03:28:52,069 --> 03:28:54,069
They touched your head sometimes?

2518
03:28:54,069 --> 03:28:56,069
By the way, can I just tell you?

2519
03:28:56,069 --> 03:28:58,069
You are probably, I would say

2520
03:28:58,069 --> 03:29:00,069
probably the most handsome police officer I've ever seen.

2521
03:29:00,069 --> 03:29:02,069
You're aware that this is like another

2522
03:29:02,069 --> 03:29:04,069
dude here, right? Like I'm a person, dude.

2523
03:29:04,069 --> 03:29:06,069
I'm sorry, I just like

2524
03:29:06,069 --> 03:29:08,069
the outfit, the uniform.

2525
03:29:08,069 --> 03:29:10,069
I really appreciate that. My mother always told me

2526
03:29:10,069 --> 03:29:12,069
I look good in blue. You do look fantastic.

2527
03:29:12,069 --> 03:29:14,069
Thank you.

2528
03:29:14,069 --> 03:29:16,069
It's the blue.

2529
03:29:16,069 --> 03:29:18,069
Listen, maybe we should

2530
03:29:18,069 --> 03:29:20,069
grab a beer sometime. I would love that.

2531
03:29:20,069 --> 03:29:22,069
I would absolutely love going out for a beer.

2532
03:29:22,069 --> 03:29:24,069
Hey, where'd you put my phone?

2533
03:29:24,069 --> 03:29:26,069
It's in my hands, bro. You made me hold it for you, dude.

2534
03:29:26,069 --> 03:29:28,069
Listen,

2535
03:29:28,069 --> 03:29:30,069
here's the thing. I can either find you for

2536
03:29:30,069 --> 03:29:32,069
$300. Don't find me.

2537
03:29:32,069 --> 03:29:34,069
Okay, and I can say that maybe

2538
03:29:34,069 --> 03:29:36,069
I didn't see the TV. I don't know.

2539
03:29:36,069 --> 03:29:38,069
But listen, man, I'm going to take the TV

2540
03:29:38,069 --> 03:29:41,399
either way. Well, guess what, officer?

2541
03:29:41,399 --> 03:29:43,399
The TV

2542
03:29:43,399 --> 03:29:45,829
doesn't fucking work.

2543
03:29:45,829 --> 03:29:47,829
It doesn't work. So you broke it.

2544
03:29:47,829 --> 03:29:49,829
I didn't break it. You

2545
03:29:49,829 --> 03:29:51,829
stole the TV and you broke it.

2546
03:29:51,829 --> 03:29:53,829
I just wanted to watch a sports program on it and

2547
03:29:53,829 --> 03:29:55,829
it didn't work.

2548
03:29:55,829 --> 03:29:57,829
It works a little bit, dude.

2549
03:29:57,829 --> 03:29:59,829
It's just like kind of abstract, man.

2550
03:29:59,829 --> 03:30:01,829
You want me to hang this

2551
03:30:01,829 --> 03:30:03,829
on the wall and make it an abstract art

2552
03:30:03,829 --> 03:30:05,829
painting? I'm sorry, you're going to have to keep your hands off

2553
03:30:05,829 --> 03:30:07,829
the contraband.

2554
03:30:07,829 --> 03:30:09,829
Listen, I'm going to have to confiscate it.

2555
03:30:09,829 --> 03:30:11,829
We're taking it.

2556
03:30:11,829 --> 03:30:13,829
We're taking it.

2557
03:30:13,829 --> 03:30:15,829
You go ahead and lift that up for me.

2558
03:30:15,829 --> 03:30:17,829
You expect me to pick up the freaking TV?

2559
03:30:17,829 --> 03:30:19,829
It's part of your community service.

2560
03:30:19,829 --> 03:30:21,829
Really?

2561
03:30:21,829 --> 03:30:23,829
Go ahead. Good luck.

2562
03:30:23,829 --> 03:30:25,829
Thank you, by the way. Thank you. Appreciate it.

2563
03:30:25,829 --> 03:30:27,829
By the way, like I've got to say before,

2564
03:30:27,829 --> 03:30:29,829
I've said it before again, probably the most handsome coffee

2565
03:30:29,829 --> 03:30:31,829
I've ever seen in my life. Can we not

2566
03:30:31,829 --> 03:30:33,829
address the fact that I'm like

2567
03:30:33,829 --> 03:30:35,829
I'm literally going like as fast

2568
03:30:35,829 --> 03:30:37,829
as I can here. Watch out for the couch.

2569
03:30:37,829 --> 03:30:39,829
Dude, we've got cables all over here.

2570
03:30:39,829 --> 03:30:41,829
This is a major safety

2571
03:30:41,829 --> 03:30:43,829
risk, dude. Like you care about safety.

2572
03:30:43,829 --> 03:30:45,829
You're a serial jaywalker.

2573
03:30:45,829 --> 03:30:47,829
Bro, there's no crosswalk in front of the library,

2574
03:30:47,829 --> 03:30:49,829
dude. What am I supposed to do?

2575
03:30:49,829 --> 03:30:51,829
Bring it up to city. Excuse me, I've got to get around you

2576
03:30:51,829 --> 03:30:53,829
for a sec.

2577
03:30:53,829 --> 03:30:55,829
Official police business, huh?

2578
03:30:55,829 --> 03:30:57,829
Yeah, official police business.

2579
03:30:57,829 --> 03:30:59,829
Dude, this is

2580
03:30:59,829 --> 03:31:01,829
ridiculous, bro. This is silly.

2581
03:31:01,829 --> 03:31:03,829
You get a load of that? Who is

2582
03:31:03,829 --> 03:31:05,829
Sleed Peralis?

2583
03:31:05,829 --> 03:31:07,829
I've never heard of that before, dude.

2584
03:31:07,829 --> 03:31:09,829
This guy.

2585
03:31:09,829 --> 03:31:11,829
Put the TV down for a sec.

2586
03:31:11,829 --> 03:31:13,829
Go have a

2587
03:31:13,829 --> 03:31:15,829
good day. Go ahead and take it. I'm not paying you

2588
03:31:15,829 --> 03:31:17,829
fine. You can take it. I don't know if you've heard of Tic-Tac

2589
03:31:17,829 --> 03:31:19,829
or whatever. Keep going. Don't TikTok me.

2590
03:31:19,829 --> 03:31:21,829
You're going to TikTok me fine.

2591
03:31:21,829 --> 03:31:23,829
Are you TikToking? Are you

2592
03:31:23,829 --> 03:31:25,829
TikToking now? Yeah, I think so.

2593
03:31:25,829 --> 03:31:32,040
I don't know how it works.

2594
03:31:32,040 --> 03:31:34,860
There. Fucking leave, please.

2595
03:31:34,860 --> 03:31:36,860
Alright. Alright. And I'm the one

2596
03:31:36,860 --> 03:31:38,860
in handcuffs, bro? I'm the one

2597
03:31:38,860 --> 03:31:40,860
getting arrested? You made me watch that.

2598
03:31:40,860 --> 03:31:42,860
I'm the one fricking in handcuffs, bro?

2599
03:31:42,860 --> 03:31:44,860
Okay.

2600
03:31:44,860 --> 03:31:47,100
This is ridiculous, dude. How far are we

2601
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:49,100
carrying this, man? Another couple miles.

2602
03:31:49,100 --> 03:31:51,100
Another couple miles, bro, dude.

2603
03:31:51,100 --> 03:31:54,940
Now I don't have TV. And I

2604
03:31:54,940 --> 03:31:56,940
smell so awful

2605
03:31:56,940 --> 03:31:59,559
to a point where it's

2606
03:31:59,559 --> 03:32:03,590
disgusting people. And now

2607
03:32:03,590 --> 03:32:05,590
why would you get a stolen TV?

2608
03:32:05,590 --> 03:32:07,590
Why? You had so many

2609
03:32:07,590 --> 03:32:09,590
options. Why pick a stolen piece of merchandise?

2610
03:32:09,590 --> 03:32:11,590
And I plugged it in. It didn't even

2611
03:32:11,590 --> 03:32:16,010
work. Unbelievable.

2612
03:32:16,010 --> 03:32:20,940
Oh shit, I'm still

2613
03:32:20,940 --> 03:32:22,940
streaming.

2614
03:32:22,940 --> 03:32:24,940
Hey, if anybody's still here.

2615
03:32:24,940 --> 03:32:26,940
Hey.

2616
03:32:26,940 --> 03:32:28,940
So I just said, hey,

2617
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:30,940
everybody, what's going on? I just

2618
03:32:30,940 --> 03:32:32,940
had a little bit of thing going on. I had my TV worked on.

2619
03:32:32,940 --> 03:32:34,940
I had a handyman come. And, you know,

2620
03:32:34,940 --> 03:32:36,940
I was trying to get like an

2621
03:32:36,940 --> 03:32:38,940
Ultra HD screen

2622
03:32:38,940 --> 03:32:40,940
put into the wall. Because, you know what I mean?

2623
03:32:40,940 --> 03:32:42,940
I got money. I got a lot of it. So

2624
03:32:42,940 --> 03:32:44,940
Ultra HD screen going into the wall back there.

2625
03:32:44,940 --> 03:32:46,940
Right in front of the kitchen, too.

2626
03:32:46,940 --> 03:32:48,940
I've got money, you know. I've got money.

2627
03:32:48,940 --> 03:32:51,690
I've got...

2628
03:32:51,690 --> 03:32:53,690
Mute the stream. Muted. I'll be right back.

2629
03:32:53,690 --> 03:33:04,700
Oy yi yi.

2630
03:33:04,700 --> 03:33:07,829
What a pain in the ass.

2631
03:33:07,829 --> 03:33:11,350
I gotta... I gotta move.

2632
03:33:11,350 --> 03:33:13,909
This neighborhood is fucked.

2633
03:33:13,909 --> 03:33:17,430
This is the most ridiculous neighborhood I've ever...

2634
03:33:17,430 --> 03:33:19,430
What an insane neighborhood.

2635
03:33:19,430 --> 03:33:27,159
It's eight. I mean, I thought I was

2636
03:33:27,159 --> 03:33:29,590
a weird guy. Do I belong

2637
03:33:29,590 --> 03:33:31,590
here or should I leave here as fast as I can?

2638
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:42,520
Right, right, right, right, right,

2639
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:47,639
right, right, right. Hey, everybody,

2640
03:33:47,639 --> 03:33:50,260
I'm back. I gotta go.

2641
03:33:50,260 --> 03:33:52,260
I know you've only gotten about four minutes of

2642
03:33:52,260 --> 03:33:54,260
content and like a sixty

2643
03:33:54,260 --> 03:33:56,260
two minute BRB screen.

2644
03:33:56,260 --> 03:33:58,260
But, you know,

2645
03:33:58,260 --> 03:34:00,260
I just... I'm working on some stuff.

2646
03:34:00,260 --> 03:34:02,260
Make sure to check out tomorrow.

2647
03:34:02,260 --> 03:34:04,260
There's gonna be a dollhouse stream tomorrow.

2648
03:34:04,260 --> 03:34:06,260
I will check it out for you. We got

2649
03:34:06,260 --> 03:34:08,260
a lot of work done on it. A lot of people were involved.

2650
03:34:08,260 --> 03:34:10,260
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

2651
03:34:10,260 --> 03:34:12,260
So I'll give you guys a link now.

2652
03:34:12,260 --> 03:34:14,760
I'll give you the link. Just send it

2653
03:34:14,760 --> 03:34:16,760
it while you're here already, so that's fine.

2654
03:34:16,760 --> 03:34:18,760
And I'll see you guys tomorrow for the dollhouse stream.

2655
03:34:18,760 --> 03:34:22,409
And goodbye.

2656
03:34:22,409 --> 03:34:25,350
Play the outro.

2657
03:34:25,350 --> 03:34:27,350
There it is. Okay.

2658
03:34:27,350 --> 03:34:30,620
I fucking hate doing

2659
03:34:30,620 --> 03:34:32,620
this. I hate streaming. I fucking

2660
03:34:32,620 --> 03:34:34,979
can't wait till I'm done. Somebody calling?

2661
03:34:34,979 --> 03:34:43,690
Hello?

03:34:43,690 --> 03:34:47,770

03:35:23,770 --> 03:35:25,770
Owie.

2682
03:35:25,770 --> 03:35:27,770
I got all day, man.

2683
03:35:27,770 --> 03:35:29,770
2. Do I have to say 2?

2684
03:35:29,770 --> 03:35:31,770
Just 2. Hang on.

2685
03:35:31,770 --> 03:35:34,329
Does that shit work on people?

2686
03:35:34,329 --> 03:35:37,909
I don't understand. Car

2687
03:35:37,909 --> 03:35:39,909
warranty? I don't have a car.

2688
03:35:39,909 --> 03:35:41,909
I literally don't have a car. I don't

2689
03:35:41,909 --> 03:35:43,909
own a car. How would a car get here?

2690
03:35:43,909 --> 03:35:50,180
I was just in there

2691
03:35:50,180 --> 03:35:53,899
and I didn't go to the bathroom.

2692
03:35:53,899 --> 03:35:55,899
This place is a mess.

2693
03:35:55,899 --> 03:35:58,200
Disaster. TV's gone.

2694
03:35:58,200 --> 03:36:00,200
My friends think I'm a

2695
03:36:00,200 --> 03:36:02,200
weirdo. I barely have

2696
03:36:02,200 --> 03:36:04,200
anybody I can fucking hang out with.

2697
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:07,659
What an absolute disaster this has

2698
03:36:07,659 --> 03:36:17,319
been. What I'm gonna need is I'm gonna need the audience

2699
03:36:17,319 --> 03:36:19,319
to give me some more volume.

2700
03:36:19,319 --> 03:36:21,319
That's what I'm gonna need. I'm getting more volume.

2701
03:36:21,319 --> 03:36:24,780
I need the audience to give me volume

2702
03:36:24,780 --> 03:36:32,139
to let me know what they want to do.

2703
03:36:32,139 --> 03:36:41,979
I thought this was gonna be easy.

2704
03:36:41,979 --> 03:36:44,860
I thought this was gonna be simple. Thought I was gonna

2705
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:46,860
be able to live here uninterrupted,

2706
03:36:46,860 --> 03:36:49,290
undisturbed. That I'd be taken

2707
03:36:49,290 --> 03:36:51,850
care of by six

2708
03:36:51,850 --> 03:36:53,850
hundred million people watching.

2709
03:36:53,850 --> 03:36:55,850
There's six hundred million people here.

2710
03:36:55,850 --> 03:36:57,850
You're making me look bad.

2711
03:36:57,850 --> 03:37:07,829
I do love this though. It's a good touch.

2712
03:37:07,829 --> 03:37:11,799
Imagine streaming and having somebody

2713
03:37:11,799 --> 03:37:13,799
sit in here with you in the bathroom.

2714
03:37:13,799 --> 03:37:15,799
Alright, finally. I'm hungry.

2715
03:37:15,799 --> 03:37:20,409
Get this out of the way.

2716
03:37:20,409 --> 03:37:22,409
I'm trying like an extension

2717
03:37:22,409 --> 03:37:24,409
cord. For the

2718
03:37:24,409 --> 03:37:26,409
TV that I can't use, that's great.

2719
03:37:26,409 --> 03:37:30,299
What do we got? We got

2720
03:37:30,299 --> 03:37:33,940
beer that people keep drinking.

2721
03:37:33,940 --> 03:37:41,049
You know what? I think I'm gonna go for a slice

2722
03:37:41,049 --> 03:37:49,370
of bread. Or a cookie

2723
03:37:49,370 --> 03:38:01,510
sandwich.

2724
03:38:01,510 --> 03:38:03,510
Don't put plastic on a stove, kids.

2725
03:38:03,510 --> 03:38:07,610
Is there blood on this? No.

2726
03:38:07,610 --> 03:38:15,459
Ah.

2727
03:38:15,459 --> 03:38:17,459
You wanna see how dirty these are over the last like three

2728
03:38:17,459 --> 03:38:22,059
or four hours? Look at this.

2729
03:38:22,059 --> 03:38:24,059
It's like I literally was walking around in mud.

2730
03:38:24,059 --> 03:38:29,819
These are white.

2731
03:38:29,819 --> 03:38:34,680
Ugh. I do have to go to the bathroom.

2732
03:38:34,680 --> 03:38:37,049
And I'm

2733
03:38:37,049 --> 03:38:40,440
tired. Very tired.

2734
03:38:40,440 --> 03:38:43,379
Can I sleep in the bed tonight

2735
03:38:43,379 --> 03:38:45,379
or are we gonna make me pass out on the toilet while I

2736
03:38:45,379 --> 03:38:47,379
take a shit and then pass out and slash my head on the

2737
03:38:47,379 --> 03:38:50,899
ground? Can we make this a normal day?

2738
03:38:50,899 --> 03:38:53,459
Huh? Huh?

2739
03:38:53,459 --> 03:38:56,090
Normal day.

2740
03:38:56,090 --> 03:38:58,389
Normal day. Bar's

2741
03:38:58,389 --> 03:39:02,420
full. I wanna go to bed.

2742
03:39:02,420 --> 03:39:04,420
I wanna pee and then I wanna go to bed.

2743
03:39:04,420 --> 03:39:10,120
Can we make that happen, please?

2744
03:39:10,120 --> 03:39:12,940
Can we? I'm trying so hard to not

2745
03:39:12,940 --> 03:39:14,940
have my arms go up because I don't want to see my armpit hairs.

2746
03:39:14,940 --> 03:39:16,940
Because that, like somebody's gonna

2747
03:39:16,940 --> 03:39:18,940
screenshot it and like keep it.

2748
03:39:18,940 --> 03:39:22,579
I don't want you to have that.

2749
03:39:22,579 --> 03:39:36,020
I don't want to go to that room. All I have in my

2750
03:39:36,020 --> 03:39:38,020
third room is

2751
03:39:38,020 --> 03:39:40,020
like stools

2752
03:39:40,020 --> 03:39:43,030
in a bed. I mean the

2753
03:39:43,030 --> 03:39:45,030
organs out there and that's pretty cool. I'm gonna

2754
03:39:45,030 --> 03:39:48,299
go back and play that. But like

2755
03:39:48,299 --> 03:39:51,049
give me something, give me a fun

2756
03:39:51,049 --> 03:39:53,420
toy. I'll take a second

2757
03:39:53,420 --> 03:39:56,170
bathroom. I don't think

2758
03:39:56,170 --> 03:40:02,250
that's even possible. Thank God.

2759
03:40:02,250 --> 03:40:11,850
This bed smells like cheez-its.

2760
03:40:11,850 --> 03:40:15,879
I didn't eat cheez-its in here.

2761
03:40:15,879 --> 03:41:13,420
Okay, alright.

2762
03:41:13,420 --> 03:41:15,420
Alright, I need two shadows in here.

2763
03:41:15,420 --> 03:41:17,420
Oh yeah, that's a bad dream

2764
03:41:17,420 --> 03:41:20,360
for Joyma.

2765
03:41:20,360 --> 03:41:22,360
Hey boys, yeah, get him up, get him up.

2766
03:41:22,360 --> 03:41:24,360
He's having a bad dream. Ain't

2767
03:41:24,360 --> 03:41:26,360
that right, big boy?

2768
03:41:26,360 --> 03:41:29,110
Oh, you're all alone.

2769
03:41:29,110 --> 03:41:31,110
All alone in your house.

2770
03:41:31,110 --> 03:41:33,110
What, you missed that maid? You missed

2771
03:41:33,110 --> 03:41:35,110
that cute maid from the other day?

2772
03:41:35,110 --> 03:41:37,110
Yeah, get him up.

2773
03:41:37,110 --> 03:41:39,290
Get him up.

2774
03:41:39,290 --> 03:41:41,290
Oh, what's that? When's the last time

2775
03:41:41,290 --> 03:41:43,290
you showered, big boy?

2776
03:41:43,290 --> 03:41:47,690
Oh yeah.

2777
03:41:47,690 --> 03:41:49,690
Okay, come on. Yeah, that's it.

2778
03:41:49,690 --> 03:41:51,690
Get him up. Get him in the bathroom.

2779
03:41:51,690 --> 03:41:53,690
Oh, I can smell him from here.

2780
03:41:53,690 --> 03:41:56,059
Come on, both

2781
03:41:56,059 --> 03:41:58,059
of you. I'm not gonna get my

2782
03:41:58,059 --> 03:42:00,059
hands dirty. There we go. Come on.

2783
03:42:00,059 --> 03:42:02,059
Yeah.

2784
03:42:02,059 --> 03:42:04,059
Big boy Joyma.

2785
03:42:04,059 --> 03:42:06,620
Oh, what's this?

2786
03:42:06,620 --> 03:42:08,620
Your game station?

2787
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:10,620
Oh, take a look at that.

2788
03:42:10,620 --> 03:42:12,860
I can smell it from

2789
03:42:12,860 --> 03:42:14,860
here. What's that,

2790
03:42:14,860 --> 03:42:16,860
dude? You gotta go to the bathroom,

2791
03:42:16,860 --> 03:42:18,860
big guy.

2792
03:42:18,860 --> 03:42:20,860
Looks to me like you gotta go to the bathroom.

2793
03:42:20,860 --> 03:42:22,860
Someone's not been taking care of their needs, boss.

2794
03:42:22,860 --> 03:42:24,860
Get him on the

2795
03:42:24,860 --> 03:42:27,290
toilet. Yeah, that's

2796
03:42:27,290 --> 03:42:29,290
it. Yeah.

2797
03:42:29,290 --> 03:42:31,290
Then Jerma

2798
03:42:31,290 --> 03:42:33,290
poops himself.

2799
03:42:33,290 --> 03:42:35,290
He poops himself in front of everybody.

2800
03:42:35,290 --> 03:42:37,290
No, no, I didn't poop my pants in front of everybody.

2801
03:42:37,290 --> 03:42:39,290
And then a cowboy comes out of the shower.

2802
03:42:39,290 --> 03:42:41,290
What if you poop yourself,

2803
03:42:41,290 --> 03:42:43,290
don't you?

2804
03:42:43,290 --> 03:42:45,290
That'd be embarrassing to poop yourself in front of

2805
03:42:45,290 --> 03:42:47,290
so many people.

2806
03:42:47,290 --> 03:42:49,290
And the cowboy's got a sword.

2807
03:42:49,290 --> 03:42:51,290
Yeah.

2808
03:42:51,290 --> 03:42:53,290
Poop yourself. You better keep

2809
03:42:53,290 --> 03:42:55,290
pooping yourself there, boy. And then he starts

2810
03:42:55,290 --> 03:42:57,290
streaming.

2811
03:42:57,290 --> 03:42:59,290
Hey, everybody, it's me,

2812
03:42:59,290 --> 03:43:01,290
Jerma.

2813
03:43:01,290 --> 03:43:03,290
Are you live pooping yourself? No. Yeah, you

2814
03:43:03,290 --> 03:43:05,290
are.

2815
03:43:05,290 --> 03:43:07,290
You are.

2816
03:43:07,290 --> 03:43:09,290
You're pooping yourself on television.

2817
03:43:09,290 --> 03:43:11,290
Oh, yeah.

2818
03:43:11,290 --> 03:43:13,290
I bet you like that, big boy.

2819
03:43:13,290 --> 03:43:15,290
I'm about to go live.

2820
03:43:15,290 --> 03:43:17,290
That's a T.O.S. violation.

2821
03:43:17,290 --> 03:43:19,290
That's a T.O.S. violation.

2822
03:43:19,290 --> 03:43:21,290
What can go wrong? And he gets up again.

2823
03:43:21,290 --> 03:43:23,290
I hear his stomach growling. Get up.

2824
03:43:23,290 --> 03:43:25,290
He's just catching the 4th grade class.

2825
03:43:25,290 --> 03:43:27,290
Get him up and then go to the

2826
03:43:27,290 --> 03:43:29,290
kitchen. And he doesn't wash his

2827
03:43:29,290 --> 03:43:31,290
hands either. Oh, disgusting.

2828
03:43:31,290 --> 03:43:33,290
I wash my hands every time. Yeah,

2829
03:43:33,290 --> 03:43:35,290
sure you do, pal.

2830
03:43:35,290 --> 03:43:37,290
No!

2831
03:43:37,290 --> 03:43:39,290
No, I didn't shit

2832
03:43:39,290 --> 03:43:41,290
myself!

2833
03:43:41,290 --> 03:43:43,290
No!

2834
03:43:43,290 --> 03:43:45,290
I'm a good boy!

2835
03:43:45,290 --> 03:43:47,290
I'm a good boy!

2836
03:43:47,290 --> 03:43:49,290
I'm a good boy!

2837
03:43:49,290 --> 03:43:51,290
I'm a good boy!

2838
03:43:51,290 --> 03:43:53,290
I'm a good boy!

2839
03:43:53,290 --> 03:43:55,290
I'm a good boy!

2840
03:43:55,290 --> 03:43:57,290
Make the sandwich when you want it.

2841
03:43:57,290 --> 03:43:59,290
It's your dream, big guy, to make the sandwich.

2842
03:43:59,290 --> 03:44:01,290
Oh, no.

2843
03:44:01,290 --> 03:44:03,290
Make the sandwich when you want it.

2844
03:44:03,290 --> 03:44:05,290
You don't have way too much room for it.

2845
03:44:05,290 --> 03:44:07,290
You did, you're a little woke up.

2846
03:44:07,290 --> 03:44:09,290
Oh, man.

2847
03:44:09,290 --> 03:44:24,389
Huh?

2848
03:44:24,389 --> 03:44:35,190
Huh?

2849
03:44:35,190 --> 03:45:19,850
What the fuck?

2850
03:45:19,850 --> 03:45:31,219
Huh?

2851
03:45:31,219 --> 03:45:35,379
What am I doing in here?

2852
03:45:35,379 --> 03:45:37,379
Oh my god. You know, when you

2853
03:45:37,379 --> 03:45:39,379
have a dream, you ever have a dream

2854
03:45:39,379 --> 03:45:41,379
where you, and you have it,

2855
03:45:41,379 --> 03:45:43,379
you have it, you have it, you have it, you have it, when you have it,

2856
03:45:43,379 --> 03:45:45,379
you have it, when you have a dream, you have it, when you have it,

2857
03:45:45,379 --> 03:45:54,340
and you had it. I feel

2858
03:45:54,340 --> 03:45:59,340
awful. Why is this stuff all over here?

2859
03:45:59,340 --> 03:46:01,899
I had this dream, I like,

2860
03:46:01,899 --> 03:46:03,899
I had this fourth grade teacher,

2861
03:46:03,899 --> 03:46:07,079
and I like

2862
03:46:07,079 --> 03:46:09,079
pooped my pants in the class, but whatever.

2863
03:46:09,079 --> 03:46:11,079
You guys don't know that, you don't need to know that.

2864
03:46:11,079 --> 03:46:13,959
Nobody needs to know that here. But pretty much

2865
03:46:13,959 --> 03:46:15,959
the end of the story is I had a bad dream about like how

2866
03:46:15,959 --> 03:46:17,959
people like laughed at me, thought I was stupid, and like

2867
03:46:17,959 --> 03:46:20,709
whatever.

2868
03:46:20,709 --> 03:46:26,860
What a fucking joke.

2869
03:46:26,860 --> 03:46:28,860
Why is all my stuff everywhere?

2870
03:46:28,860 --> 03:46:31,350
Why is my stuff everywhere?

2871
03:46:31,350 --> 03:46:35,579
Why am I holding two pieces of bread?

2872
03:46:35,579 --> 03:46:40,629
Ay yi yi.

2873
03:46:40,629 --> 03:46:46,700
Ugh.

2874
03:46:46,700 --> 03:46:48,700
That was very weird.

2875
03:46:48,700 --> 03:46:50,700
That was

2876
03:46:50,700 --> 03:46:52,700
very weird.

2877
03:46:52,700 --> 03:46:54,700
That was, that was,

2878
03:46:54,700 --> 03:47:06,260
ugh. I want to go play

2879
03:47:06,260 --> 03:47:08,260
the organ. At least I'll have some fun.

2880
03:47:08,260 --> 03:47:12,940
Ugh.

2881
03:47:12,940 --> 03:47:18,700
Do I have any mail? I'm the, I gotta get

2882
03:47:18,700 --> 03:47:20,940
rid of this.

2883
03:47:20,940 --> 03:47:23,370
Hope you didn't see that on camera.

2884
03:47:23,370 --> 03:47:26,250
What's in the mail?

2885
03:47:26,250 --> 03:47:31,370
It got

2886
03:47:31,370 --> 03:47:37,260
rain.

2887
03:47:37,260 --> 03:47:45,319
What's in the mail?

2888
03:47:45,319 --> 03:47:49,860
There's nothing in the mailbox.

2889
03:47:49,860 --> 03:47:51,860
I don't see anything in this mailbox.

2890
03:47:51,860 --> 03:47:56,979
There's nothing in the mailbox.

2891
03:47:56,979 --> 03:48:04,659
There was no mail. I'm doing this.

2892
03:48:04,659 --> 03:48:11,829
Play

2893
03:48:11,829 --> 03:48:13,829
public

2894
03:48:13,829 --> 03:48:15,829
domain

2895
03:48:15,829 --> 03:48:18,709
music?

2896
03:48:18,709 --> 03:48:20,709
Play public domain music?

2897
03:48:20,709 --> 03:48:23,659
Is that what they said?

2898
03:48:23,659 --> 03:48:25,659
Um, okay.

2899
03:48:25,659 --> 03:48:27,659
Play

2900
03:48:27,659 --> 03:48:29,659
public domain music?

2901
03:48:29,659 --> 03:48:31,659
Play

2902
03:48:31,659 --> 03:48:33,659
public domain music?

2903
03:48:33,659 --> 03:48:35,659
Play

2904
03:48:35,659 --> 03:48:37,659
public domain music?

2905
03:48:37,659 --> 03:48:39,659
Play

2906
03:48:39,659 --> 03:48:41,659
public domain music?

2907
03:48:41,659 --> 03:48:46,579
Play

2908
03:48:46,579 --> 03:48:51,700
public domain music?

2909
03:48:51,700 --> 03:49:00,409
Maybe take a shower now.

2910
03:49:00,409 --> 03:49:22,149
Oh, I, that's fucking

2911
03:49:22,149 --> 03:49:24,780
water.

2912
03:49:24,780 --> 03:49:28,620
Real shower.

2913
03:49:28,620 --> 03:49:40,469
Oh, I think I have my tetanus shot.

2914
03:49:40,469 --> 03:49:56,270
Hey, there we go.

2915
03:49:56,270 --> 03:49:58,879
Nice and clean.

2916
03:49:58,879 --> 03:50:09,020
Ready to take on the day.

2917
03:50:09,020 --> 03:50:10,299
It's a centralized location.

2918
03:50:10,299 --> 03:50:11,620
Nope.

2919
03:50:11,620 --> 03:50:13,620
Puh, puh.

2920
03:50:13,620 --> 03:50:16,620
German's house.

2921
03:50:16,620 --> 03:50:21,940
Ah, very, very good.

2922
03:50:21,940 --> 03:50:26,760
Oh, very, very good.

2923
03:50:26,760 --> 03:50:31,489
Oh, gotta get those bars green.

2924
03:50:32,370 --> 03:50:34,170
Very green.

2925
03:50:34,170 --> 03:50:36,459
Lime green.

2926
03:50:36,459 --> 03:50:38,020
Citrus green.

2927
03:50:41,819 --> 03:50:44,260
Pistachio green.

2928
03:50:44,260 --> 03:50:49,600
Uh, what else is green?

2929
03:50:49,600 --> 03:50:50,440
Toad green.

2930
03:50:50,440 --> 03:50:53,659
Frog green.

2931
03:50:53,659 --> 03:50:55,260
Green green.

2932
03:50:55,260 --> 03:51:01,579
Grass green.

2933
03:51:01,579 --> 03:51:02,780
Take a long one today.

2934
03:51:09,610 --> 03:51:14,930
Ugh, I'm letting it hit me directly in the chest.

2935
03:51:14,930 --> 03:51:17,340
I like turn the water up like kinda high,

2936
03:51:17,340 --> 03:51:20,260
and then it just hits me directly in the chest

2937
03:51:20,260 --> 03:51:22,100
and it feels so good.

2938
03:51:22,100 --> 03:51:24,780
I come up with like a red, burnt chest, but I love it.

2939
03:51:26,780 --> 03:51:27,780
What the, hello?

2940
03:51:27,780 --> 03:51:28,620
Hello?

2941
03:51:29,979 --> 03:51:30,819
What are you doing?

2942
03:51:30,819 --> 03:51:31,659
Mr. Germa.

2943
03:51:31,659 --> 03:51:32,500
Hey, hey, what are you doing here?

2944
03:51:32,500 --> 03:51:33,700
What are you doing?

2945
03:51:33,700 --> 03:51:34,540
Look, Wig.

2946
03:51:34,540 --> 03:51:36,020
Yeah, no, I'm your maid.

2947
03:51:36,020 --> 03:51:41,409
You didn't even ask my name once.

2948
03:51:41,409 --> 03:51:42,250
Who is it?

2949
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:43,090
Who is it?

2950
03:51:43,090 --> 03:51:45,129
Oh, it's the maid.

2951
03:51:45,129 --> 03:51:47,969
What are you just calling out, maids?

2952
03:51:47,969 --> 03:51:49,129
Is this your fiance?

2953
03:51:49,129 --> 03:51:50,489
I'm in the shower, please.

2954
03:51:50,489 --> 03:51:52,569
Gosh, oh, please, I'm so embarrassed.

2955
03:51:52,569 --> 03:51:53,530
I'm in the shower.

2956
03:51:53,530 --> 03:51:54,930
All right, I'll go to your bedroom, then.

2957
03:51:54,930 --> 03:51:55,770
I'll go to your bedroom.

2958
03:51:55,770 --> 03:51:56,610
What the hell are you doing?

2959
03:51:56,610 --> 03:51:58,209
You said come back every few days.

2960
03:51:58,209 --> 03:52:00,889
I did, but I, look, it's been a few days.

2961
03:52:00,930 --> 03:52:02,690
Okay, all right, just do what you think.

2962
03:52:08,260 --> 03:52:09,500
The name's Amelia.

2963
03:52:09,500 --> 03:52:10,340
It's Amelia.

2964
03:52:10,340 --> 03:52:12,219
Amelia, okay, Amelia, thank you.

2965
03:52:12,219 --> 03:52:15,180
I appreciate it, but I need to come out of the shower now.

2966
03:52:15,180 --> 03:52:17,100
I need to come out of the shower now.

2967
03:52:18,459 --> 03:52:25,379
Who needs this many stools?

2968
03:52:25,379 --> 03:52:28,379
All right, well, first I'm just gonna clean the,

2969
03:52:28,379 --> 03:52:31,930
I need to move this.

2970
03:52:31,930 --> 03:52:33,290
What was that?

2971
03:52:33,290 --> 03:52:37,459
Perhaps steps.

2972
03:52:37,459 --> 03:52:39,500
Okay, that looks good.

2973
03:52:39,500 --> 03:52:41,299
That makes sense.

2974
03:52:41,299 --> 03:52:42,739
I gotta move this stuff out of my,

2975
03:52:42,780 --> 03:52:44,299
Amelia will take care of that.

2976
03:52:44,299 --> 03:52:47,860
I don't have to worry about that.

2977
03:52:47,860 --> 03:52:50,139
Sir, can I do the bathroom?

2978
03:52:51,190 --> 03:52:57,299
I'm not, I'm not in the bathroom anymore.

2979
03:52:57,299 --> 03:52:59,059
I don't think, I don't think,

2980
03:52:59,059 --> 03:53:00,860
I'm no longer in the bathroom.

2981
03:53:00,860 --> 03:53:03,500
Perfect, I'll just stay out of your way.

2982
03:53:03,500 --> 03:53:04,340
Good.

2983
03:53:14,739 --> 03:53:15,739
You dropped this.

2984
03:53:16,860 --> 03:53:17,700
Thank you so much.

2985
03:53:17,700 --> 03:53:19,299
Yes, you looking for an outlet?

2986
03:53:19,299 --> 03:53:20,819
Oh, yeah, I think there's,

2987
03:53:20,819 --> 03:53:22,379
I have no idea where one is.

2988
03:53:24,180 --> 03:53:26,139
I think there's one outlet in the whole house.

2989
03:53:27,139 --> 03:53:27,979
There's one right here, sir, thank you.

2990
03:53:27,979 --> 03:53:28,819
You got it?

2991
03:53:28,819 --> 03:53:37,229
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

2992
03:53:37,229 --> 03:53:39,030
That's a beautiful vacuum cleaner.

2993
03:53:39,030 --> 03:53:41,069
A lot of bathroom usage for you today, sir.

2994
03:53:41,069 --> 03:53:42,709
Almost as beautiful as you.

2995
03:53:42,709 --> 03:53:43,709
What?

2996
03:53:43,709 --> 03:53:47,129
That vacuum is almost as beautiful as you are.

2997
03:53:47,129 --> 03:53:50,940
I mean it.

2998
03:53:50,940 --> 03:53:51,780
What is it, what is that?

2999
03:53:51,780 --> 03:53:53,620
It's the sweetest thing I've heard all week.

3000
03:53:53,620 --> 03:53:55,020
Heck you.

3001
03:53:55,020 --> 03:53:56,260
Can I get a hug?

3002
03:53:56,260 --> 03:53:57,260
Yes, sure.

3003
03:53:59,549 --> 03:54:02,899
Absolutely, come here.

3004
03:54:02,899 --> 03:54:05,379
Thank you, there you are.

3005
03:54:05,379 --> 03:54:07,959
You need to go to the bathroom, it's right here.

3006
03:54:07,959 --> 03:54:09,879
Thank you for telling me that.

3007
03:54:09,959 --> 03:54:11,559
Yes, of course, absolutely.

3008
03:54:11,559 --> 03:54:19,200
And you know that I mean it.

3009
03:54:19,200 --> 03:54:23,229
I keep getting this fucking huge migraine.

3010
03:54:23,229 --> 03:54:24,950
And I feel like somebody's telling me

3011
03:54:24,950 --> 03:54:28,299
I'm being controlled by something.

3012
03:54:28,299 --> 03:54:30,110
What the fuck?

3013
03:54:30,110 --> 03:54:35,360
I mean, they look good, they do.

3014
03:54:35,360 --> 03:54:42,500
They look good.

3015
03:54:42,500 --> 03:54:44,719
Everything okay in here?

3016
03:54:44,719 --> 03:54:46,639
Yeah, no, everything's great in here.

3017
03:54:48,719 --> 03:54:52,440
Sorry, you might know I'm not that used to cleaning.

3018
03:54:52,440 --> 03:54:53,280
Yep.

3019
03:54:53,280 --> 03:54:54,319
Up stuff.

3020
03:54:54,319 --> 03:54:55,159
Okay.

3021
03:54:55,879 --> 03:54:57,680
Um, what's the problem?

3022
03:54:57,680 --> 03:54:59,239
What's the problem?

3023
03:54:59,239 --> 03:55:03,209
Yeah, it's a computer, you can just move it out of the way.

3024
03:55:03,209 --> 03:55:05,010
I'm unsure how to clean it, sir.

3025
03:55:05,010 --> 03:55:05,850
Well just push it out of the way

3026
03:55:05,850 --> 03:55:08,260
and you can just dust it or something.

3027
03:55:08,260 --> 03:55:09,819
Yeah, I'll be in here, you got it.

3028
03:55:09,819 --> 03:55:10,659
You're fine.

3029
03:55:10,659 --> 03:55:13,200
Great, I'll just move it out of the way.

3030
03:55:20,110 --> 03:55:32,049
Oh, I like what they did with this.

3031
03:55:32,049 --> 03:55:32,930
All right, I gotta go to work.

3032
03:55:32,930 --> 03:55:34,409
Oh, that's not too loud, is it?

3033
03:55:34,409 --> 03:55:35,729
No, it's fine, I gotta go to work.

3034
03:55:35,729 --> 03:55:37,090
I'll see you later, have a good time.

3035
03:55:37,090 --> 03:55:37,930
All right, thank you.

3036
03:55:37,930 --> 03:55:41,010
Again, I want, and this might be a little neurotic,

3037
03:55:41,010 --> 03:55:44,209
but I like vertical lines, not horizontal, okay?

3038
03:55:44,209 --> 03:55:45,729
You like vertical lines, not horizontal?

3039
03:55:45,729 --> 03:55:46,569
Like vertical lines, not horizontal.

3040
03:55:46,569 --> 03:55:47,969
You get a couch in the middle of your living room,

3041
03:55:47,969 --> 03:55:50,049
you use the computer in your bathroom.

3042
03:55:50,049 --> 03:55:51,610
I woke up and came here

3043
03:55:51,610 --> 03:55:53,610
and there was a piece of toilet paper on the floor.

3044
03:55:53,610 --> 03:55:55,049
We prefer vertical lines.

3045
03:55:56,569 --> 03:55:58,610
You can do horizontal if you want.

3046
03:55:58,610 --> 03:55:59,489
I would hope.

3047
03:55:59,489 --> 03:56:00,690
Yeah.

3048
03:56:00,690 --> 03:56:01,530
You can do horizontal.

3049
03:56:01,530 --> 03:56:05,510
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

3050
03:56:05,510 --> 03:56:08,610
Vertical lines.

3051
03:56:08,610 --> 03:56:14,620
Guys, a psycho.

3052
03:56:14,620 --> 03:56:16,940
Not very much slack left, by the way.

3053
03:56:25,950 --> 03:56:27,469
Thank God for Uncle Ted,

3054
03:56:27,469 --> 04:03:33,729
because otherwise I would have no fucking money.

3055
04:03:33,729 --> 04:03:35,120
See you later.

3056
04:03:35,120 --> 04:03:39,850
Goodbye.

3057
04:03:39,850 --> 04:03:41,010
That was a good day.

3058
04:03:41,010 --> 04:03:43,090
I feel pretty good about that day.

3059
04:03:43,090 --> 04:03:47,899
Hungry, thirsty, ready, but I made some money.

3060
04:03:47,899 --> 04:03:49,850
That's good, right?

3061
04:03:49,850 --> 04:03:50,969
Still kind of a mess out there.

3062
04:03:50,969 --> 04:03:54,069
I really wish the, I really wish.

3063
04:03:54,069 --> 04:03:56,270
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

3064
04:03:56,270 --> 04:03:58,190
Goodbye, yep, see you later.

3065
04:03:58,190 --> 04:03:59,510
I didn't press it.

3066
04:04:00,909 --> 04:04:02,229
I gotta get that doorbell looked at.

3067
04:04:02,229 --> 04:04:05,770
I need like an electrician.

3068
04:04:05,770 --> 04:04:09,979
Okay.

3069
04:04:09,979 --> 04:04:13,209
Why is this open?

3070
04:04:13,209 --> 04:04:14,170
Why is this open?

3071
04:04:23,540 --> 04:04:25,969
It looks pretty clean in here.

3072
04:04:25,969 --> 04:04:27,370
Not bad.

3073
04:04:27,370 --> 04:04:41,379
I mean, it could be a little better, but whatever.

3074
04:04:44,049 --> 04:04:44,889
Hi.

3075
04:04:48,020 --> 04:04:50,819
How dare you just walk in when I'm cleaning?

3076
04:04:50,819 --> 04:04:52,020
The shoes are in the bed.

3077
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:52,860
What?

3078
04:04:52,860 --> 04:04:53,680
You had your shoes on in the-

3079
04:04:53,680 --> 04:04:54,520
I took them off.

3080
04:04:54,520 --> 04:04:55,360
I'm not a psycho.

3081
04:04:55,360 --> 04:04:56,180
I don't sleep with my shoes on.

3082
04:04:56,180 --> 04:04:57,020
But you took your shoes off and the shoes were

3083
04:04:57,020 --> 04:04:57,860
in the bed with you.

3084
04:04:57,860 --> 04:04:59,100
Why were they not like on the side of the bed?

3085
04:04:59,100 --> 04:04:59,940
Because I was cleaning the bed

3086
04:04:59,940 --> 04:05:01,260
and I put them on the side of the bed.

3087
04:05:01,260 --> 04:05:02,420
You weren't here for that.

3088
04:05:02,420 --> 04:05:04,219
Anyway, it took me a little bit longer today,

3089
04:05:04,219 --> 04:05:05,379
so it's gonna be 300.

3090
04:05:06,979 --> 04:05:08,579
Okay.

3091
04:05:08,579 --> 04:05:10,100
Is that because you slept in the room

3092
04:05:10,100 --> 04:05:10,940
or is that because you do-

3093
04:05:10,940 --> 04:05:13,709
You don't talk to me like that.

3094
04:05:14,750 --> 04:05:16,430
No, I was, Amelia, it was-

3095
04:05:16,430 --> 04:05:18,030
No, it's fine.

3096
04:05:18,030 --> 04:05:20,629
I was just saying, like I come from work

3097
04:05:20,629 --> 04:05:21,469
and you're in bed.

3098
04:05:21,469 --> 04:05:22,290
I picked up a piece of toilet paper with poop on it,

3099
04:05:22,290 --> 04:05:25,010
but I'm the one to blame.

3100
04:05:25,010 --> 04:05:26,430
There's been more than one person here.

3101
04:05:26,430 --> 04:05:27,770
There's been at least four people here.

3102
04:05:27,770 --> 04:05:30,030
I found a pair of pants with poop on it.

3103
04:05:30,030 --> 04:05:32,129
Did you poop yourself?

3104
04:05:32,129 --> 04:05:34,049
I'm wearing the same pants I was.

3105
04:05:34,129 --> 04:05:35,450
Five days ago.

3106
04:05:35,450 --> 04:05:37,170
That's even more concerning.

3107
04:05:37,170 --> 04:05:40,610
And by the way, I may have pooped my pants,

3108
04:05:40,610 --> 04:05:44,989
but goodness gracious, I mean, you look great.

3109
04:05:44,989 --> 04:05:47,590
And I think that you and I could probably

3110
04:05:47,590 --> 04:05:49,250
maybe go out sometime.

3111
04:05:49,250 --> 04:05:50,370
Well, I don't know.

3112
04:05:50,370 --> 04:05:51,370
I'll see what I'm doing tomorrow.

3113
04:05:51,370 --> 04:05:54,129
Let's call it 300 and I'll be on my way.

3114
04:05:54,129 --> 04:05:55,129
Sure, $300.

3115
04:05:55,129 --> 04:05:56,129
Great.

3116
04:05:56,129 --> 04:05:58,129
Hey, it's been great.

3117
04:05:58,129 --> 04:05:59,930
It's been fantastic.

3118
04:05:59,930 --> 04:06:01,489
We should go out sometime.

3119
04:06:01,489 --> 04:06:02,729
You wanna go out sometime?

3120
04:06:03,250 --> 04:06:04,889
Well, I just said I might be free tomorrow.

3121
04:06:04,889 --> 04:06:08,610
Like, yeah, but like I got a wild schedule.

3122
04:06:08,610 --> 04:06:10,579
Can I confirm it?

3123
04:06:10,579 --> 04:06:11,420
Sure.

3124
04:06:11,420 --> 04:06:12,239
Okay.

3125
04:06:12,239 --> 04:06:14,059
I don't think I wanna shake your hand

3126
04:06:14,059 --> 04:06:15,500
after you said you pooped yourself.

3127
04:06:15,500 --> 04:06:16,340
How about this one?

3128
04:06:16,340 --> 04:06:20,469
Great.

3129
04:06:20,469 --> 04:06:26,930
Yeah!

3130
04:06:26,930 --> 04:06:32,360
Woohoo!

3131
04:06:32,360 --> 04:06:40,639
Looks like we got a date.

3132
04:06:40,639 --> 04:06:45,639
You know, there are three to four options

3133
04:06:47,250 --> 04:06:48,989
when you get a choice.

3134
04:06:48,989 --> 04:06:51,610
You know, there's a few different things

3135
04:06:51,610 --> 04:06:54,459
you can choose from each time.

3136
04:06:54,459 --> 04:06:59,479
Not sure you're aware of that at this point.

3137
04:06:59,479 --> 04:07:00,319
I feel pretty good.

3138
04:07:00,319 --> 04:07:01,159
I feel pretty good.

3139
04:07:01,159 --> 04:07:02,879
I feel pretty good.

3140
04:07:02,879 --> 04:07:04,520
Although I'm very hungry.

3141
04:07:06,430 --> 04:07:07,270
Oh!

3142
04:07:18,280 --> 04:07:22,469
Can I eat something?

3143
04:07:22,469 --> 04:07:24,590
What are you gonna do?

3144
04:07:24,590 --> 04:07:25,430
I saw mine.

3145
04:07:25,430 --> 04:07:26,389
That's the first time I've looked at chat

3146
04:07:26,389 --> 04:07:28,510
in like four plus hours or so.

3147
04:07:28,510 --> 04:07:30,959
I saw minus twos.

3148
04:07:30,959 --> 04:07:45,440
Thank you.

3149
04:07:45,440 --> 04:07:48,500
Look at the same loaf of bread every time.

3150
04:07:55,799 --> 04:07:57,639
This bread has lasted a long time.

3151
04:07:58,079 --> 04:08:06,229
I hope my hands are really clean.

3152
04:08:06,229 --> 04:08:10,360
I've been cleaning them.

3153
04:08:10,360 --> 04:08:13,430
I'm actually glad I'm wearing these gloves

3154
04:08:13,430 --> 04:08:16,430
because I mean, they're just, they're absolutely gross,

3155
04:08:16,430 --> 04:08:21,639
but I really am happy I have them on.

3156
04:08:21,639 --> 04:08:22,479
I have an apple too.

3157
04:08:22,479 --> 04:08:39,389
Why would I not eat the apple?

3158
04:08:39,389 --> 04:08:43,629
I wanna hang out in here.

3159
04:08:43,629 --> 04:08:49,120
Ah!

3160
04:08:49,120 --> 04:08:49,959
Ah!

3161
04:08:49,959 --> 04:08:52,110
I'm gonna sit down.

3162
04:08:52,110 --> 04:08:52,950
God!

3163
04:08:52,950 --> 04:08:54,309
You work all day.

3164
04:08:54,309 --> 04:08:55,350
You come back.

3165
04:08:55,350 --> 04:08:59,280
You just wanna sit on your bed.

3166
04:08:59,280 --> 04:09:06,180
Why am I sleeping in here?

3167
04:09:06,180 --> 04:09:08,979
I could have paid you hundreds of dollars

3168
04:09:09,139 --> 04:09:11,790
for just sleeping in the bed.

3169
04:09:11,790 --> 04:09:15,069
Like, I wonder how, I was gone for six and a half hours.

3170
04:09:15,069 --> 04:09:20,600
I bet you they were sleeping in this bed for four.

3171
04:09:20,600 --> 04:09:28,309
What?

3172
04:09:28,309 --> 04:09:35,879
I'm not gonna, I'm not smelling anything.

3173
04:09:35,879 --> 04:09:48,360
In fact, I want this bed fucking removed from the house.

3174
04:09:48,360 --> 04:09:50,559
All right, let's do some Twitch TV streaming.

3175
04:09:55,569 --> 04:10:08,309
Ah, every time.

3176
04:10:08,309 --> 04:10:10,430
Okay, let's go.

3177
04:10:10,430 --> 04:10:17,459
Get these, I gotta get at least one off, right?

3178
04:10:17,459 --> 04:10:21,340
Okay, let's go live.

3179
04:10:21,340 --> 04:10:25,229
So we're gonna do some Germacraft, some Minecraft.

3180
04:10:25,229 --> 04:10:27,149
Why don't we call this episode one.

3181
04:10:27,149 --> 04:10:31,260
Live Germacraft.

3182
04:10:31,260 --> 04:10:36,059
And let's go live.

3183
04:10:36,059 --> 04:10:38,399
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

3184
04:10:38,399 --> 04:10:42,799
Jerma here with episode one of Germacraft.

3185
04:10:42,799 --> 04:10:45,159
You know, of course, the series where I play Minecraft.

3186
04:10:45,159 --> 04:10:46,520
And it's gonna be really fun.

3187
04:10:46,520 --> 04:10:49,120
There's gonna be a lot of trials, a lot of triumphs,

3188
04:10:49,120 --> 04:10:50,120
a lot of fails.

3189
04:10:50,120 --> 04:18:30,180
And, uh, I don't know, that was a funny dream.

3190
04:18:31,170 --> 04:18:34,229
Ah, so, uh, by the way,

3191
04:18:34,229 --> 04:18:35,709
before I turn the stream off, everybody,

3192
04:18:35,709 --> 04:18:37,709
I just wanted to say, um,

3193
04:18:37,709 --> 04:18:42,059
if you go to germa985.com,

3194
04:18:42,059 --> 04:18:44,899
we've got merchandise for you, we've got posters for you,

3195
04:18:44,899 --> 04:18:46,379
we've got all kinds of things you can get,

3196
04:18:46,379 --> 04:18:49,329
and some of them might even be signed, too.

3197
04:18:49,329 --> 04:18:51,629
Oh, sorry, I'm talking to you guys, too.

3198
04:18:51,629 --> 04:18:52,930
Have a good day.

3199
04:18:52,930 --> 04:18:54,209
I'm not even online.

3200
04:18:54,209 --> 04:18:59,729
The stream's been off for like the last three hours.

3201
04:18:59,729 --> 04:19:03,229
I'm gonna be banned for two days.

3202
04:19:03,229 --> 04:19:04,829
Am I gonna get permanently banned from Twitch

3203
04:19:04,829 --> 04:19:06,030
if I do that again?

3204
04:19:06,030 --> 04:19:06,870
Just don't do that again.

3205
04:19:07,709 --> 04:19:08,790
I'm actually might not be able to stream again.

3206
04:19:08,790 --> 04:19:11,030
If you want, like, income, don't do that.

3207
04:19:18,649 --> 04:19:23,000
So that's what I heard.

3208
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:24,840
Ah, cool, a bunk bed!

3209
04:19:26,739 --> 04:19:36,409
Oh!

3210
04:19:36,409 --> 04:19:38,409
It's another mystery box!

3211
04:19:38,409 --> 04:19:42,760
Oh my goodness, I wonder what's in this one.

3212
04:19:42,760 --> 04:19:44,860
God, you give people a loot box option,

3213
04:19:44,860 --> 04:19:45,700
and that's what they're gonna pick,

3214
04:19:45,700 --> 04:19:47,139
like, three out of 10 times,

3215
04:19:47,139 --> 04:19:48,620
which would be 30%, which is not that much.

3216
04:19:48,620 --> 04:19:50,819
I mean, like, five out of 10, which would be 50.

3217
04:19:50,819 --> 04:19:59,909
How about let's go eight out of 10?

3218
04:19:59,909 --> 04:20:03,100
You couldn't have put anything else in there, in here.

3219
04:20:03,100 --> 04:20:05,059
You couldn't have put, like, rubber duckies or something.

3220
04:20:05,059 --> 04:20:07,700
It's three more stools?

3221
04:20:07,700 --> 04:20:08,860
This is the biggest bait ever.

3222
04:20:08,860 --> 04:20:12,270
You're just, people would probably be pissed.

3223
04:20:12,270 --> 04:20:17,590
Okay, I'm, uh, all right.

3224
04:20:17,590 --> 04:20:22,360
Well, let's get this out of the way.

3225
04:20:22,360 --> 04:20:27,889
I heard an explosion in this room.

3226
04:20:27,889 --> 04:20:31,030
This bed is, I'm moving this.

3227
04:20:31,030 --> 04:20:32,649
Get this out of the way.

3228
04:20:32,649 --> 04:20:34,170
I'm putting this over here.

3229
04:20:37,290 --> 04:20:39,090
Let me at least get this correct here.

3230
04:20:44,000 --> 04:20:44,819
Decorate?

3231
04:20:44,819 --> 04:20:47,799
Yeah, I can do that.

3232
04:20:47,799 --> 04:20:48,680
By the way, though, I do have to pee,

3233
04:20:48,680 --> 04:20:50,559
so I would do that soon.

3234
04:20:52,149 --> 04:21:00,350
Um, sure, can I get rid of the box part of the decoration?

3235
04:21:00,350 --> 04:21:03,940
Decorate the, where would I want the bed?

3236
04:21:03,940 --> 04:21:05,500
I definitely don't want the bed in front of the door.

3237
04:21:05,500 --> 04:21:08,979
That would be a pain in the ass.

3238
04:21:08,979 --> 04:21:11,899
Let's go with over here.

3239
04:21:11,899 --> 04:21:12,739
Probably against the wall.

3240
04:21:12,739 --> 04:21:15,299
I want it against the wall.

3241
04:21:15,299 --> 04:21:24,469
That makes more sense to me.

3242
04:21:24,469 --> 04:21:25,309
That looks good.

3243
04:21:25,309 --> 04:21:29,690
Why would you have a bed, like, over here?

3244
04:21:29,690 --> 04:21:31,879
I like that.

3245
04:21:31,879 --> 04:21:32,819
It's a twin bed.

3246
04:21:32,819 --> 04:21:34,059
I don't have to worry about the other side.

3247
04:21:34,059 --> 04:21:37,709
Who cares?

3248
04:21:37,709 --> 04:21:43,309
All right, then, what about the mystery box?

3249
04:21:43,790 --> 04:21:45,840
We can put that in the corner.

3250
04:21:45,840 --> 04:21:50,270
And then I'll put the, um, put these in the,

3251
04:21:50,270 --> 04:21:57,750
I don't know, what am I supposed to do with these?

3252
04:21:57,750 --> 04:21:59,750
What a shitty bedroom.

3253
04:21:59,750 --> 04:22:07,750
This looks like I'm still moving into this house.

3254
04:22:07,750 --> 04:22:13,700
How about two over there, and so over here.

3255
04:22:13,700 --> 04:22:17,139
Okay, good.

3256
04:22:17,139 --> 04:22:22,100
I have to pee real bad, like, right now.

3257
04:22:22,100 --> 04:22:26,290
Um, how about on top of the mystery box?

3258
04:22:26,290 --> 04:22:30,329
It's a beautiful day outside.

3259
04:22:30,329 --> 04:22:32,299
Beautiful day.

3260
04:22:32,299 --> 04:22:33,659
I want one of these next to the bed

3261
04:22:33,659 --> 04:22:35,829
so I can put my legs over.

3262
04:22:35,829 --> 04:22:39,180
That makes sense to me.

3263
04:22:39,180 --> 04:22:41,379
There couldn't have been anything else in that box.

3264
04:22:41,379 --> 04:22:47,819
Anything else.

3265
04:22:47,819 --> 04:22:49,799
I don't know what to do with these.

3266
04:22:50,799 --> 04:22:54,489
I don't even have a shelf to put anything on.

3267
04:22:54,489 --> 04:22:56,530
That's there, that's, that can just stay there.

3268
04:22:56,530 --> 04:22:58,530
I don't, I don't care.

3269
04:22:58,530 --> 04:23:00,100
That's fine.

3270
04:23:00,100 --> 04:23:02,299
That can stay.

3271
04:23:02,299 --> 04:23:03,340
How does it look?

3272
04:23:03,340 --> 04:23:04,579
You like it?

3273
04:23:04,579 --> 04:23:06,510
What do you think?

3274
04:23:06,510 --> 04:23:16,899
Thank you.

3275
04:23:16,899 --> 04:23:18,100
Yes, yes, yes.

3276
04:23:18,100 --> 04:23:19,420
This is nice, 985.

3277
04:23:19,420 --> 04:23:21,219
This is a wonderful, wonderful place.

3278
04:23:21,420 --> 04:23:23,020
Thank you for letting me be, I appreciate it.

3279
04:23:23,020 --> 04:23:24,579
Do you think we should try?

3280
04:23:24,579 --> 04:23:25,899
I don't see why we shouldn't.

3281
04:23:25,899 --> 04:23:27,020
I think it'll make sense.

3282
04:23:27,020 --> 04:23:29,260
Oh, it's even in tune.

3283
04:23:29,260 --> 04:23:31,340
Oh, this is perfect.

3284
04:23:31,340 --> 04:23:32,180
Wonderful.

3285
04:23:32,180 --> 04:23:35,100
Why don't we start off with some 985?

3286
04:23:36,100 --> 04:23:37,340
We'll practice 985.

3287
04:23:37,340 --> 04:23:38,180
985.

3288
04:23:38,180 --> 04:23:39,340
That sounds good, let's do that.

3289
04:23:39,340 --> 04:23:40,180
985.

3290
04:23:43,219 --> 04:23:44,780
I'm trying something new.

3291
04:23:44,780 --> 04:23:47,469
Oh, all right, go ahead.

3292
04:23:47,469 --> 04:23:53,690
Ready?

3293
04:23:53,690 --> 04:23:54,889
Or get outside.

3294
04:23:54,889 --> 04:23:58,250
God our father.

3295
04:23:58,809 --> 04:24:01,409
He's our daddy.

3296
04:24:01,409 --> 04:24:04,010
He's our daddy.

3297
04:24:04,010 --> 04:24:06,379
He's our friend.

3298
04:24:06,379 --> 04:24:07,620
I don't know why the organs blink.

3299
04:24:07,620 --> 04:24:17,889
He's our friend.

3300
04:24:17,889 --> 04:24:19,700
Father, not daddy.

3301
04:24:19,700 --> 04:24:21,579
Sorry about that.

3302
04:24:21,579 --> 04:24:23,020
I'm sorry about that.

3303
04:24:23,020 --> 04:24:25,379
Excuse me.

3304
04:24:25,379 --> 04:24:29,020
Oh, Edna, how are you?

3305
04:24:29,020 --> 04:24:29,860
I'm doing great.

3306
04:24:29,860 --> 04:24:30,700
Who are you?

3307
04:24:32,299 --> 04:24:33,940
Jerma, you were here a few days ago?

3308
04:24:33,940 --> 04:24:34,780
Oh, okay.

3309
04:24:34,780 --> 04:24:35,860
You were here last week?

3310
04:24:35,860 --> 04:24:36,780
Oh, yes.

3311
04:24:36,819 --> 04:24:39,979
Jerma, we heard you had this wonderful organ.

3312
04:24:39,979 --> 04:24:40,819
Yes.

3313
04:24:40,819 --> 04:24:43,219
I heard how impressive your organ was,

3314
04:24:43,219 --> 04:24:46,180
and I just wanted to come over and play with your organ,

3315
04:24:46,180 --> 04:24:48,979
with my choir, of course, from church.

3316
04:24:48,979 --> 04:24:50,420
Okay. Bless you.

3317
04:24:50,420 --> 04:24:51,420
Bless you.

3318
04:24:51,420 --> 04:24:52,260
Bless you, too.

3319
04:24:52,260 --> 04:24:53,940
If you wanna join in.

3320
04:24:53,940 --> 04:24:56,219
Would you like to join us?

3321
04:24:56,219 --> 04:24:57,059
I don't, I wouldn't.

3322
04:24:57,059 --> 04:25:00,500
Why don't you just stick around and see what happens.

3323
04:25:00,500 --> 04:25:02,659
Step on over with them, that'll be great.

3324
04:25:02,659 --> 04:25:05,620
Your organ is so big, I'll have to use two hands.

3325
04:25:05,620 --> 04:25:06,459
Here we go.

3326
04:25:06,459 --> 04:25:07,620
You'll have to use two hands to play an organ.

3327
04:25:07,620 --> 04:25:09,219
Yes, okay.

3328
04:25:09,219 --> 04:25:11,139
I don't think you play an organ with one hand.

3329
04:25:11,139 --> 04:25:12,899
It's not like a flute.

3330
04:25:12,899 --> 04:25:13,739
Over here?

3331
04:25:13,739 --> 04:25:14,559
Yeah.

3332
04:25:14,559 --> 04:25:16,579
All right, let's take it from the top.

3333
04:25:16,579 --> 04:25:17,420
From the top, Edna?

3334
04:25:17,420 --> 04:25:18,260
From the top.

3335
04:25:18,260 --> 04:25:19,100
From the top of where?

3336
04:25:19,100 --> 04:25:20,659
You'll figure it out.

3337
04:25:20,659 --> 04:25:21,500
What page are we on?

3338
04:25:21,500 --> 04:25:22,340
Song 985.

3339
04:25:24,489 --> 04:25:28,209
God came down from the land.

3340
04:25:28,209 --> 04:25:32,610
God came down from the land.

3341
04:25:32,610 --> 04:25:36,770
And he took us all by the hand.

3342
04:25:36,770 --> 04:25:41,370
And he took us all by the hand.

3343
04:25:41,370 --> 04:25:42,530
And then we started.

3344
04:25:42,530 --> 04:25:46,540
And then he started dancing.

3345
04:25:46,540 --> 04:25:50,979
And then we started dancing.

3346
04:25:50,979 --> 04:25:52,180
He's got the spirit.

3347
04:25:52,180 --> 04:25:53,659
Remix.

3348
04:25:53,659 --> 04:25:54,500
Remix.

3349
04:25:56,059 --> 04:25:59,020
But God came down to the land in the land.

3350
04:25:59,020 --> 04:26:02,020
God came down to the land in the land.

3351
04:26:02,020 --> 04:26:04,899
I can't believe what's happening right now.

3352
04:26:04,899 --> 04:26:07,739
I can't believe what's happening right now.

3353
04:26:07,739 --> 04:26:09,780
Get that migraine again.

3354
04:26:09,780 --> 04:26:10,620
Oh, okay, let's.

3355
04:26:10,620 --> 04:26:12,260
And he came down to the.

3356
04:26:12,260 --> 04:26:13,459
Why don't you lead us in it?

3357
04:26:13,459 --> 04:26:14,739
Why don't you lead us in it?

3358
04:26:14,739 --> 04:26:17,700
And he came down to the land.

3359
04:26:17,700 --> 04:26:20,659
And he came down to the land.

3360
04:26:20,659 --> 04:26:21,500
And he,

3361
04:26:23,620 --> 04:26:27,979
he ate, he brought wine and sand.

3362
04:26:27,979 --> 04:26:31,979
And he brought wine and sand.

3363
04:26:32,020 --> 04:26:35,620
And then he left my front yard.

3364
04:26:35,620 --> 04:26:39,620
And then he left my front yard.

3365
04:26:39,620 --> 04:26:40,860
They went to the fridge.

3366
04:26:40,860 --> 04:26:43,100
He got himself a nice big tub of lard.

3367
04:26:43,100 --> 04:26:47,420
And went to the fridge and got a big tub of lard.

3368
04:26:47,420 --> 04:26:49,860
I'm gonna get, get, get, get, get you drunk.

3369
04:26:49,860 --> 04:26:51,020
Get you all drunk.

3370
04:26:51,020 --> 04:26:53,059
On God's love.

3371
04:26:53,059 --> 04:26:55,100
What the fuck is happening?

3372
04:26:55,100 --> 04:26:56,020
On God's love.

3373
04:26:56,020 --> 04:26:57,219
On God's love.

3374
04:26:57,219 --> 04:26:58,420
On God's love.

3375
04:26:58,420 --> 04:26:59,260
On God's love.

3376
04:26:59,260 --> 04:27:00,860
Excellent, excellent, my children.

3377
04:27:00,860 --> 04:27:01,700
God bless you all.

3378
04:27:02,500 --> 04:27:03,340
Is he done?

3379
04:27:03,340 --> 04:27:04,180
Is he done singing with you?

3380
04:27:04,180 --> 04:27:05,020
Yeah, I think so.

3381
04:27:05,020 --> 04:27:05,860
Get you drunk.

3382
04:27:05,860 --> 04:27:09,500
We could ask.

3383
04:27:09,500 --> 04:27:10,340
That was beautiful.

3384
04:27:10,340 --> 04:27:11,180
Get back.

3385
04:27:11,180 --> 04:27:12,020
But that's my organ

3386
04:27:12,020 --> 04:27:13,379
and I'd like for you all to leave.

3387
04:27:13,379 --> 04:27:16,329
Well, we would like our book back.

3388
04:27:16,329 --> 04:27:18,049
Unless you, of course, would like to study on your own.

3389
04:27:18,049 --> 04:27:19,370
We'll save it for you at the church

3390
04:27:19,370 --> 04:27:21,370
and you can come sing with us any time.

3391
04:27:21,370 --> 04:27:22,209
Okay.

3392
04:27:22,209 --> 04:27:23,209
All right, wonderful.

3393
04:27:23,209 --> 04:27:24,049
Thank you.

3394
04:27:24,049 --> 04:27:24,870
Bless you.

3395
04:27:24,870 --> 04:27:25,709
See you on Sunday.

3396
04:27:25,709 --> 04:27:27,250
Thank you, please actually do that a few times

3397
04:27:27,250 --> 04:27:29,290
because there's been a lot of fucking weirdos here.

3398
04:27:29,290 --> 04:27:30,530
Bye now, bye now.

3399
04:27:30,530 --> 04:27:31,370
I'm sorry.

3400
04:27:33,239 --> 04:27:36,049
Have a great day.

3401
04:27:36,049 --> 04:27:41,049
All right, now I don't want to hear them any more.

3402
04:27:48,809 --> 04:27:49,649
But wait, wait a minute.

3403
04:27:49,649 --> 04:27:50,489
Wait a second.

3404
04:27:52,090 --> 04:27:54,319
Hey, wait, wait a minute.

3405
04:27:54,319 --> 04:27:56,040
Wait, I really, I want that book.

3406
04:27:56,040 --> 04:27:57,559
I want that book.

3407
04:27:57,559 --> 04:27:58,639
I think the book.

3408
04:27:58,639 --> 04:27:59,680
Can I have one of those books?

3409
04:27:59,680 --> 04:28:00,520
Yes, sir.

3410
04:28:00,520 --> 04:28:01,360
Thank you so much.

3411
04:28:01,360 --> 04:28:02,180
I'd love one of these books.

3412
04:28:02,180 --> 04:28:03,020
Can I keep it?

3413
04:28:03,020 --> 04:28:03,840
Yes, you may.

3414
04:28:03,840 --> 04:28:04,680
And I can have it.

3415
04:28:04,680 --> 04:28:05,520
You probably should.

3416
04:28:05,520 --> 04:28:08,360
Yeah, what passage should I read from

3417
04:28:08,360 --> 04:28:11,639
to get rid of bears, people that I don't want in the house?

3418
04:28:11,639 --> 04:28:15,680
Jeremiah 985 is actually my favorite chapter.

3419
04:28:15,680 --> 04:28:16,639
Okay.

3420
04:28:16,639 --> 04:28:17,479
Okay, yeah.

3421
04:28:17,479 --> 04:28:18,319
All right.

3422
04:28:18,319 --> 04:28:19,159
Here.

3423
04:28:20,360 --> 04:28:21,399
I'll put it in the mailbox.

3424
04:28:21,399 --> 04:28:22,639
Yes, yes, probably good.

3425
04:28:24,000 --> 04:28:24,840
He'll find it.

3426
04:28:26,040 --> 04:28:28,239
And he'll find his way home.

3427
04:28:28,239 --> 04:28:29,879
Yes, we have.

3428
04:28:29,879 --> 04:28:30,799
Good job, sister.

3429
04:28:30,799 --> 04:28:34,209
Very good.

3430
04:28:34,209 --> 04:28:35,850
Hope they're still there.

3431
04:28:35,850 --> 04:28:48,649
Really hope they're still here.

3432
04:28:48,649 --> 04:28:59,280
What an embarrassment.

3433
04:28:59,280 --> 04:29:07,639
Don't play this too loud because they'll come back.

3434
04:29:07,639 --> 04:29:08,860
I'm fucking hungry.

3435
04:29:08,860 --> 04:29:13,200
I'm tired and I have not showered.

3436
04:29:13,200 --> 04:29:24,469
You hear that?

3437
04:29:24,469 --> 04:29:39,540
Thank you.

3438
04:29:39,540 --> 04:29:40,700
How does she not know who I am?

3439
04:29:40,700 --> 04:29:46,770
She's been here like, she was here like fucking a week ago.

3440
04:29:46,770 --> 04:29:52,129
That's over budget of farting.

3441
04:29:52,129 --> 04:29:59,700
That's definitely over fart budget.

3442
04:29:59,700 --> 04:30:03,600
Ah, better.

3443
04:30:03,600 --> 04:30:04,520
Thank goodness.

3444
04:30:18,559 --> 04:30:23,389
I brush my teeth every time I get in the shower, every time.

3445
04:30:23,389 --> 04:30:26,760
Saves like two minutes each day.

3446
04:30:26,760 --> 04:30:29,469
That's too over budget.

3447
04:30:29,629 --> 04:30:30,469
That's too many.

3448
04:30:34,159 --> 04:30:37,770
I know it's fun to do that,

3449
04:30:37,770 --> 04:30:40,049
but no, I know it's really,

3450
04:30:40,049 --> 04:30:41,809
you don't just get them all out of your system right now.

3451
04:30:41,809 --> 04:30:43,090
I'll shit in the shower.

3452
04:30:43,090 --> 04:30:47,719
Get them out of your system.

3453
04:30:47,719 --> 04:31:07,399
All right.

3454
04:31:07,399 --> 04:31:10,489
You need a lot of characters in your time,

3455
04:31:10,489 --> 04:31:11,930
but character development

3456
04:31:11,930 --> 04:31:14,090
and internal characterization of yourself

3457
04:31:14,090 --> 04:31:16,040
is very important.

3458
04:31:16,040 --> 04:31:18,559
The more you think about who you are as a person

3459
04:31:18,559 --> 04:31:21,270
and what you do, the deeds you do,

3460
04:31:21,270 --> 04:31:24,219
that's how you can shape yourself as a person.

3461
04:31:24,260 --> 04:31:26,299
Or if you want to know,

3462
04:31:26,299 --> 04:31:33,590
fill words to make yourself sound intelligent.

3463
04:31:33,590 --> 04:31:37,010
Oh, should I have a date?

3464
04:31:37,010 --> 04:31:39,950
I have a date with a maid.

3465
04:31:39,950 --> 04:31:40,909
Fuck.

3466
04:31:40,909 --> 04:31:41,750
Right now?

3467
04:31:43,840 --> 04:31:45,760
I don't want to bail on Amelia.

3468
04:31:46,680 --> 04:31:57,649
That would be a mistake.

3469
04:31:57,649 --> 04:32:00,329
I'm just so tired.

3470
04:32:00,329 --> 04:32:02,209
No, they'll, they'll, they'll understand.

3471
04:32:02,209 --> 04:32:03,049
They'll understand.

3472
04:32:03,049 --> 04:32:04,129
It's fine.

3473
04:32:04,129 --> 04:32:06,299
This is too comfy.

3474
04:32:06,299 --> 04:32:07,219
Another time, another time.

3475
04:32:07,219 --> 04:32:08,620
I'll just, I'll text them or something.

3476
04:32:08,620 --> 04:32:10,719
I'll just let them know.

3477
04:32:10,719 --> 04:40:02,900
I'll just text them.

3478
04:40:02,900 --> 04:40:07,119
Kind of comfy, but what did I miss?

3479
04:40:07,119 --> 04:40:11,580
Oh, I had a date.

3480
04:40:11,580 --> 04:40:14,110
It's okay.

3481
04:40:14,110 --> 04:40:15,790
Oh, my back hurts.

3482
04:40:26,409 --> 04:40:28,659
My knee.

3483
04:40:28,659 --> 04:40:37,970
You can't sleep sitting down.

3484
04:40:37,970 --> 04:40:40,009
Not bad.

3485
04:40:40,009 --> 04:40:40,889
I felt worse.

3486
04:40:51,159 --> 04:40:57,299
Okay.

3487
04:40:57,299 --> 04:41:01,069
Had a bed already.

3488
04:41:01,069 --> 04:41:01,909
Hungry.

3489
04:41:01,909 --> 04:41:05,349
This is not very stable, by the way.

3490
04:41:05,349 --> 04:41:07,639
I'm not sure I can sleep on this.

3491
04:41:07,639 --> 04:41:09,520
I already had a bed.

3492
04:41:09,520 --> 04:41:15,279
Is that a bed sandwich?

3493
04:41:15,279 --> 04:41:21,500
That's all right.

3494
04:41:21,500 --> 04:41:25,259
I had a better bed in my dorm room in college than this.

3495
04:41:31,349 --> 04:41:34,930
I'm hungry.

3496
04:41:42,810 --> 04:41:46,150
Can I make some food, please?

3497
04:41:46,150 --> 04:41:57,490
Am I making something to eat?

3498
04:41:57,490 --> 04:42:00,080
I'm so hungry.

3499
04:42:00,080 --> 04:42:04,689
I am starving.

3500
04:42:04,689 --> 04:42:05,529
Does it matter?

3501
04:42:05,529 --> 04:42:06,369
Can I eat?

3502
04:42:06,369 --> 04:42:08,930
I don't want to eat bread for a seventh time.

3503
04:42:08,930 --> 04:42:15,270
I really don't.

3504
04:42:15,270 --> 04:42:16,110
Here, you know what?

3505
04:42:16,110 --> 04:42:19,139
We're doing hot dogs.

3506
04:42:19,139 --> 04:42:19,979
What do I got?

3507
04:42:19,979 --> 04:42:21,139
Do I have hot dogs?

3508
04:42:21,139 --> 04:42:22,659
No.

3509
04:42:22,659 --> 04:42:24,020
We're doing butter and eggs.

3510
04:42:24,020 --> 04:42:24,939
My favorite.

3511
04:42:24,939 --> 04:42:40,529
That was very loud.

3512
04:42:42,569 --> 04:42:43,689
This.

3513
04:42:43,689 --> 04:42:46,750
Ow.

3514
04:42:46,750 --> 04:42:48,470
Not bad.

3515
04:42:52,860 --> 04:42:54,970
Not bad.

3516
04:42:54,970 --> 04:42:55,810
Another few minutes.

3517
04:42:55,810 --> 04:42:56,810
Another 30 seconds or so.

3518
04:42:56,810 --> 04:43:01,580
Should be ready to eat.

3519
04:43:01,580 --> 04:43:03,389
Here we are.

3520
04:43:03,389 --> 04:43:04,470
Need another cup.

3521
04:43:04,470 --> 04:43:09,389
Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.

3522
04:43:09,389 --> 04:43:10,869
Oops, oops.

3523
04:43:10,869 --> 04:43:11,709
Oh shit.

3524
04:43:12,590 --> 04:43:14,229
Oh shit.

3525
04:43:14,229 --> 04:43:15,069
Oh shit.

3526
04:43:16,630 --> 04:43:17,830
Oh shit.

3527
04:43:17,830 --> 04:43:19,750
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,

3528
04:43:19,750 --> 04:43:20,950
oh my God, oh my God, what do I do?

3529
04:43:20,950 --> 04:43:21,790
What do I do?

3530
04:43:21,790 --> 04:43:22,630
What do I do?

3531
04:43:23,509 --> 04:43:24,750
What do I do, what do I do, what do I do?

3532
04:43:24,750 --> 04:43:26,750
What do I do, what do I do?

3533
04:43:26,750 --> 04:43:27,750
What do I do, what do I do?

3534
04:43:27,750 --> 04:43:28,590
Ah, ah.

3535
04:43:30,590 --> 04:43:34,430
Fire, it's a fire.

3536
04:43:34,430 --> 04:43:35,709
Do I have anything?

3537
04:43:35,709 --> 04:43:39,419
Do I have any?

3538
04:43:39,419 --> 04:43:40,500
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

3539
04:43:40,500 --> 04:43:47,330
I think I have something.

3540
04:43:47,330 --> 04:43:51,740
Give me this.

3541
04:43:51,740 --> 04:43:58,319
Fuck.

3542
04:43:58,319 --> 04:44:06,959
Oh, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

3543
04:44:06,959 --> 04:44:10,900
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

3544
04:44:10,900 --> 04:44:11,900
This.

3545
04:44:11,900 --> 04:44:13,750
What the fuck?

3546
04:44:13,750 --> 04:44:14,669
Oh shit.

3547
04:44:15,549 --> 04:44:17,610
Oh.

3548
04:44:17,610 --> 04:44:19,689
Oh no.

3549
04:44:19,689 --> 04:44:26,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3550
04:44:26,880 --> 04:44:29,549
Holy shit.

3551
04:44:29,549 --> 04:44:36,549
Get out of here! Get out of here, you little bastard! Get out of here, you little bastard!

3552
04:44:36,549 --> 04:44:43,549
Shit! No, fuck! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Stay down there, you motherfucker!

3553
04:44:43,549 --> 04:44:52,279
Damn it! This thing's fucking jammed!

3554
04:44:52,279 --> 04:44:55,840
Ah, fuck, whatever, okay, it's alright, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3555
04:44:55,840 --> 04:44:58,840
It's alright, everything's gonna be fine, everything's gonna be fine.

3556
04:44:58,840 --> 04:45:05,139
Everything's gonna be just fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be, come here, come here.

3557
04:45:05,139 --> 04:45:08,139
Shit! I can't fucking hit him!

3558
04:45:08,139 --> 04:45:13,860
This thing! What are you doing?

3559
04:45:13,860 --> 04:45:17,740
What the fuck are you talking about?

3560
04:45:17,740 --> 04:45:20,740
Ah! Someone's at the door! Someone's at the door!

3561
04:45:20,740 --> 04:45:25,430
I can't fight this motherfucker! You're a big fire, I don't know if I can do this!

3562
04:45:25,430 --> 04:45:29,939
Alright, I'm coming at you!

3563
04:45:29,939 --> 04:45:34,939
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't wanna fight him, he's huge! He's huge, he's a huge guy, he's a huge fire!

3564
04:45:34,939 --> 04:45:37,939
Steve, keep waving, ah, fuck!

3565
04:45:37,939 --> 04:45:41,299
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

3566
04:45:41,299 --> 04:45:43,299
Ah, shit! No!

3567
04:45:43,299 --> 04:45:45,299
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
