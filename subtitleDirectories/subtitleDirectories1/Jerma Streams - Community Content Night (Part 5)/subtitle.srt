1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:12,740
Start breathing. I can't, guys, I can't hear him breathing. Is he there? Can anybody hear him breathe?

2
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:26,329
Oh, shit. Imagine if I, could you guys hear me breathing before? Could you guys hear me breathe?

3
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:33,100
No, no, no, okay. Somebody's asking, where are the Winx? Well, it's disabled for now,

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,820
because we're going to give a specific place at a specific time today to do them.

5
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:49,259
Winx are going to be, we're gonna, we're gonna sit here for a little while. Winx are going to be

6
00:00:50,460 --> 00:01:02,969
like 75% off. What were they, 75? They'll probably be like 10 or like 15,000. I'm just

7
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:09,260
going to sit there and listen to some music at the end of the stream today for like 20 minutes

8
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:19,019
or so and just fucking wink into the camera, like a hundred times, and then they ain't ever coming

9
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:25,049
back. They're going to be gone forever. I'm going to fuck up his eyes. No, no, no, no, no,

10
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:35,819
don't worry. I put eye drops in. I'll be all right. I'm going to set up like a Mario coin noise.

11
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,900
We'll just play a coin every time one comes in. You know, like a prding!

12
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:51,049
Frashing the wink economy. Well, the wink, here's the thing. You should have sold Winx

13
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,400
a week ago, right? You shouldn't be buying Winx now. You knew that the store was closing.

14
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,640
You didn't know that. Was this not going to be a wink bounce? There's not going to be a bounce

15
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:17,340
back in price. The store is closing. But anyways, welcome to community content night. This is for

16
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:26,020
the month of January. I think January into the first little bit of February. There is a lot of

17
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:33,909
stuff and I have to determine how I want to continue doing community content night going forward

18
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,110
because it seems like we're always 30, 40 days behind, even when we do hundreds of pieces of

19
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:50,969
artwork and dozens and dozens and dozens of videos every time. So there's always so much stuff. I am

20
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:58,419
flabbergasted at the amount of artwork and videos and music that people give

21
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:06,810
to this community and especially these streams. So I got to try to figure out a solution to make

22
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:18,229
it so we're not constantly like five weeks behind no matter what. Instead of doing it once a month,

23
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:24,860
I might try to do something like this more than that or we'll have to put a like maybe like a

24
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,659
filter on the submissions or something. I haven't figured out what I want to do.

25
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,860
It's either reduce the amount of things you show on stream or do it way more often. And I'm not

26
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:55,780
sure which one of those I want to do every other hour. But here we are. Just tell people to stop

27
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:03,509
making content. Hey everybody, don't make anything anymore. But we can get started.

28
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,659
Do it quicker. Well, that's the thing. I don't want to have it get to a point where I'm just like

29
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,579
fanning out fucking artwork cards. Just like that one, that one, that one, that one, that one,

30
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:20,019
that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one. Those are all cool, right? All right,

31
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,740
next. What we got next? This one, that one, that one, this way, that way, this way.

32
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:42,069
That kind of defeats the purpose. But here we go. Is my camera on? I'm going to play some music.

33
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,759
Can you hear the music? I'm already, I got, I got the, oh by the way, sorry, I'm like 40 minutes

34
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:55,639
late. Listen, the reason why I'm 40 minutes late is because fucking daylight savings time

35
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,259
kicked in last night and I didn't even know. This is shit that I don't even pay attention to.

36
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:07,379
I don't pay attention. Daylight fucking savings time. No, I had no idea. So I woke up this morning

37
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:14,100
and had some stuff I had to do that it was like 11 45 before I started my day. It's like, okay,

38
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,540
cool. Thanks. I got out of the shower and I'm just looking at my phone like, wait, what? It's

39
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:26,199
fucking noon? How's that possible? I said that what we should do is, hold on, let's look, take

40
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:40,389
a look at this. First of all, yeah, this is Celeste OST. Turn it down a little bit. But yeah,

41
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:47,750
daylight savings time just fucking killed me. It was like, everybody loves going back,

42
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,790
but nobody likes going forward. But when you go forward, you're just adding the time from when

43
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:58,250
you've lost it. It's just like, I hate the bouncing back and forth. I'd rather just like,

44
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,899
can we just do 30 minutes permanently forward? Like, do we have to go back an hour and then

45
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,839
forward an hour? Like, why can't we just do like a permanent, like 20 minutes forward?

46
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:13,480
Like, could it be 20 minutes and like 20 back? Does it have to be a full hour? Why does it have

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,019
to be a full hour? Make it like, I know it's the, I know it's like the farming and you're trying to

48
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:25,720
get as much daylight as possible. I, I, I, I know, I know the theory. I know, I know the reasons.

49
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:38,139
It's not even for farming. It's not, it doesn't, that doesn't even matter anymore. Does it not?

50
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:45,910
Does that not even, what's going on with my fucking like weird bug hair? Oh, we're good.

51
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,540
Anyways, daylight savings time. This should be like a fucking, it should be on the news.

52
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:59,060
I like the, the space cats though. This is very pretty. It's going a little more.

53
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:09,560
It was to save, what was it? It was to save resources during World War II. It's useless now.

54
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:16,600
It was to save resources during World War II? That's not, is that not even, is that, am I,

55
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,420
that's not even true. That's fake. Did I, was it, did I just get like a, like a Facebook fucking

56
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:31,879
reblog of something that's not even real? This is beautiful though. Look at this dude. He boogie.

57
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:39,180
If Jerma looks at this, please DM me a clip on Discord. Oh, there you go. Let's get a DM.

58
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:49,610
Well, hold on. No, not all of you. Not, not all of you. This guy's fucking mentions are

59
00:07:49,610 --> 00:08:11,819
going to blow the fuck up. Thanks for the fireman. I like all of us. Oh man. I, I, whatever. What am

60
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,629
I supposed to do? Be like, Hey, don't, don't do that. I just like to think about what I want

61
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:26,310
to do with fireman too. Fireman needs something. Fireman needs like his own merchandise. Like

62
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:36,490
people love fireman so much. Fireman accounts for at least 10 to 20%, maybe even more, like

63
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:43,850
30% of every submission. Like everybody loves this guy. I've got, I've got to, I've got to have

64
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:52,090
something. It's like, it would be like, why, why don't I not have anything? He's cool. He's,

65
00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:00,580
he's really fucking cool. He's wicked cool. The jackbox shit got taken down. Yeah. I have to figure

66
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:10,919
out what I want to do. This is a Murius. This is me controlling Murius. I love Murius so much.

67
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:19,500
Every time I see a cow, it makes me happy. You get the eyes right too. That's the best part.

68
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:34,389
Like frog eyes. That's not, that's not the cow's name. The audio is out of sync. Can we,

69
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:40,309
do we still have to keep this joke on that? Like my audio doesn't match up. How long are we going

70
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:49,980
to keep this going? Is this the new, your mic is muted? Is this, Hey, your mic's muted. My mic's

71
00:09:49,980 --> 00:10:00,360
muted? Oh, fuck. Is that the new mic muted? It is slightly delayed. That's not even possible.

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:19,259
This shit's not even possible. It's like 10 milliseconds. It's not even, it's impossible.

73
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:45,580
All right. Anyways, it's not, clip me this. I want to see. Uh, but this is beautiful though.

74
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:53,750
It's not even delayed. These people have this shit internet. What? Why did nobody clip? I just,

75
00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:00,789
I specifically demanded that somebody clip. I specifically asked that somebody clip that.

76
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:16,679
Nobody clipped it. You, uh, this is, I was trying to figure out when there's another thing of what

77
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:23,019
to do about, uh, photo shops. There's a lot of photo shops that get put into the community content,

78
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:31,000
uh, discord. I'm trying to think like, should it, should it, should photo shops be allowed anymore?

79
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,990
Cause like, there's like hundreds of photo shops. Keep them, ban them, no. But some photos, this is

80
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,909
the thing. It's like, this is why it's hard to determine what's like, what should be on screen.

81
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:50,710
Cause some photo shops are just like, somebody took the squish tool and like dragged it across

82
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,919
the screen. And it's like, all right, dude, you just, you like did the squish tool and you just

83
00:11:54,919 --> 00:12:03,049
like dragged it across my eyes and my nose and you hit export. And then some of them are very,

84
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:14,250
very well made. It's still art. Yeah. But just remove the bad ones. Well, that's the thought.

85
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:19,940
That's the idea is like, just slowly try to cut off, uh, have a filter at least somewhere. So it's

86
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,500
not just like 100% of everything gets put on the screen. I'm trying to figure it out. This is only

87
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:37,350
community content. Number five. I love, I love shitposts. I love shitposts, but you, but we,

88
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,110
should we just have like a shit? But no, we can't have a shitpost category because shitposts,

89
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,139
that could be everything. That could be literally anything. And if you have a shitpost category,

90
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,730
holy fuck that. You think that there's, there's, there's like a thousand submissions a month. Now

91
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,980
it will be like 5,000 shitposts a month as physically not even possible to show on stream.

92
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:07,529
It would be like, that's like two weeks of streams. Oh no, that would, that'd be impossible.

93
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:18,259
Electric skin plus glass body. He said he loves it. Do a shitpost week. Yeah. I can't just like

94
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:28,379
stream myself looking at shitposts. Electric skin. This is from, um, what's that Kingsway?

95
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:45,899
Is this Kingsway? Show your armpits. No. Get out of here. Please play Danganronpa. Some, uh,

96
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:55,879
Jerma Rumble fan art. And we got the pencil. Let's get a good zoom in here. I like this. I like the,

97
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:07,529
I like the bug guys. Do not play Danganronpa. Don't, don't worry. I'm not going to. Don't worry.

98
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:16,659
I'm not, I'm not going to play Danganronpa. I, like, I'm just not, I'm not going to. I fucking

99
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:24,500
hate the pencil. So do I. And I made him. That was the biggest mistake of my whole entire career.

100
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,220
Biggest mistake of my entire career was creating this character. Because the second that that,

101
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,580
that I made him and the second that that video went up, I was like, no,

102
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:46,309
no, that was a mistake to make him. But, uh, I, I, I, I, I'm breaking my rules saying I'll never

103
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:52,620
play something. That's not true. I might never play it. There's some more, uh, art. What's this?

104
00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:06,009
Uh, spy crab. Pick dastardly Richard, glue man. This is year of the rat. That's true. It's like

105
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:28,299
a fireman rat. So what is next year? What's next year? The year of you're the fish rat too.

106
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:45,269
All right. You're a year of the rat too. You're actually you're on the fish. Is it the ox? I,

107
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,580
this one's here because I wanted to go over this because this is wrong. This is incredibly

108
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:57,419
inaccurate. That's been corrected. Um, health is actually at one at this point. I have one bar in

109
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:05,769
hell. DPS is probably somewhere around like somewhere around a yellow. I definitely not

110
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:23,350
red. Definitely not speed. Speed is app is, is speed is that fucking red. Did you see how you

111
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:30,169
couldn't even see how fast that was. That was too fast. The camera didn't pick it up. What fell the

112
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:37,850
we sensor bar. It's okay. That's made it a fucking plastic. Uh, defense is probably like a yellow

113
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,850
range is like a green. I mean, I'm, I don't have that much like, I don't have that much range.

114
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,929
I mean, I'll be honest with you. I do have, actually I kind of have long arms though.

115
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:58,789
I have really long fucking arms. I have like a short body and long arms and a long torso.

116
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:03,929
The only reason why I'm like just about five eight is because I have like this big ass like

117
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:14,440
swimmer's torso. So I got, I don't have long legs, but I got a long torso. He's lanky Kong.

118
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,119
Yeah. Lanky Kong. If lanky Kong was like five inches shorter than how big he is.

119
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,809
And I kind of have big hands too. Remember we talked about this. Like I've got big hands.

120
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:36,200
He has no grace. Yeah. But that thing, this is, this is definitely way up here. Lanky Kong is

121
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:45,240
not a red on speed. Lanky Kong is like a zero for speed, isn't he? You're like an alien. Yes,

122
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,980
I have an alien body. That's correct. I've got really wide shoulders, like a small waist, long

123
00:17:50,980 --> 00:18:04,359
torso, like big fucking eyes. No, I don't. The Bostonian psycho. It's me with a Shido.

124
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,910
He has no style. He has no grace. This guy's got a funny face. Yeah. That means that's,

125
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:22,200
what else does it say about lanky Kong? What are the other lanky Kong lyrics?

126
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:35,779
This Kong is a fucking disgrace. That's not the lyrics. That's not the lyrics. It does not say

127
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:44,119
that. It doesn't. No, it doesn't say that. It doesn't say why. They wouldn't put that in a

128
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:54,099
kid's game. I like this one though, with my trusted friend Shido. It does say that. It does not say

129
00:18:54,099 --> 00:19:03,029
that. I like the background. I like the, Jerma is doing a thing where he talks about art again,

130
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:07,670
where he's like, I like the background. I like how squishy it is. Like, I don't know what the

131
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,970
fuck I'm talking about. It didn't say fucking. No, it didn't. Why would it do that? I hate some rat.

132
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:29,769
It's like a bunny. It's a bunny rat. You got the facial hair, right? That's like, that's pristine.

133
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:39,880
Correct. I do, I even, I have hairs that grow up here. I really do. Can I even show this? Like,

134
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,299
I have hairs that like grow up here. You see that? There's like hair up here. Like, why is

135
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:59,349
their hair growing here? Like, why is that happening? You get a zit? One. One in 10 years.

136
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:12,259
Sorry. One zit in 10 years. Sorry, guys. Now, this, this is the thumbnail for a video

137
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:21,019
called the Speedy Grinner. The video, I think, has been DMCA takedown by this point.

138
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:28,619
So, if you are the owner and operator of the Speedy Grinner video, you're gonna have to

139
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:37,240
probably re-upload it because this was not available when I tried to click it. Stay. Stay.

140
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:51,509
Imagine taking down a Jerma video. Wait, is it, it's back up? Is it? Hold on. Let me get this. Is

141
00:20:51,509 --> 00:21:00,779
this it? Alright, let me, hold on. Let me just get this added. Is this actually it or is this a

142
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:09,000
fucking gnome or something? Please tell me you guys aren't doing this to me right now. Let me

143
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:19,160
just check it. Click on the crosswalk. Why, why, why, click on crosswalk. Why does it, why does it,

144
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:26,980
I'm not a robot. Why does YouTube think I'm a robot now? Oh, the Speedy Grinner. There it is.

145
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,880
Alright. Yeah, no, it's real. Alright, let me just put this in the queue here. Probably just start

146
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:46,250
with that. It's easy just to put it there. Alright, back to what we were doing. There we go. This is

147
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:54,069
just, you know, a scary image of the guy that I get referred to a lot as, which is unfortunate

148
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:59,349
because I don't think I am this person at all. I think that I'm more of, you already know.

149
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:15,720
You guys know who I think that I am. My Marvel fursona. It's the Riddler. You have to be smart

150
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,559
to be the Riddler. You gotta be fucking, you know how I'm smart enough. You gotta be fucking smart.

151
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:31,559
If you keep cunning, dangerous, and with it, and this is a Joker. I'm doing a Joker.

152
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:45,180
I'm the Riddler. That's my, that's my Marvel fursona. I'm the Riddler. Punch, punch, defend,

153
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:58,630
break his legs. What is this from? Punch, punch, defend, break his legs. Oh, it's from Black and

154
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:19,220
White, right. Murius. Punch, punch, break his legs. What a psycho. I'm the Riddler. The Riddler's a

155
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,099
psycho too. If you do like a psycho-analytical on the Riddler, he's a, he's a, he's a psycho,

156
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:30,230
so that's fine. Jeremy Albertson. A stupid fucking production of some kind of currency thing.

157
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:39,900
Oh, a stupid fucking production. Stupid fuck. Stupid fucking goddamn. No, I gotta do the face too.

158
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:54,539
Wanna see an actor? Stupid fucking goddamn fucking thing. Stupid fucking goddamn fucking

159
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:05,720
piece of fucking shit. Stupid fucking thing. Fucking ridiculous. I'm not really bad. I mean,

160
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:15,670
I'm an actor. But I do. Some kind of currency thing. Uh, I got too scared of these to finish

161
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:37,509
them. Sincerely snoozing copter. Uh, I'm scared of these too. Yeah, these freak me out. The one in

162
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:47,269
the back is, no, this one right here. It's like Bilbo grab the ring vibes. I make the Bilbo grab

163
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:54,630
the ring fucking face all the time, don't I? Like, I can't even, I do that all the time.

164
00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:04,500
Not even on purpose. That one looks real. It's not real. Uh, this is Jerma the cute goblin.

165
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:23,910
Okay, I thought these, I thought I had a bunch of earrings. Is this hair? It's the same face.

166
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:39,900
It's close. These need to be a little higher. No, my hair's too long. You can't even see it.

167
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:51,690
Pretty cool. Teeth, my, my teeth goblin. Oh, tooth goblin. Uh, you are fooled to believe

168
00:25:52,650 --> 00:26:10,839
that I can be contained. Uh, are you going to grow mutton chops? You know, it might be kind of funny

169
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:17,380
for me to do that, but, uh, if I just shaved everything else and let this grow disgustingly,

170
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:27,099
um, I, my, my girlfriend would no longer touch me. Like, I'm just going to be honest with you.

171
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,009
If I did that and it was, it was these gross, big, long hairs here and it would be all fucked up and

172
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:40,539
all gross and disgusting. I, I, I, you're, you're, you're literally making me delete

173
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:57,960
my entire intimate life that I have with my girlfriend. So that's Wolverine appeal. No,

174
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:06,549
the appeal of Wolverine is nice. It's, it's thick and it's, it's there. And no, that's not the appeal

175
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:11,509
of Wolverine. The appeal of Wolverine, Wolverine's got fucking scissors that come out of his hands.

176
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:20,390
What are you talking about? You get rid of the scissors on his hands and his healing capability

177
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:39,420
and he's just a guy on the subway. It's not, oh, Wolverine has that. He can do 600 sit-ups.

178
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,359
Yeah, because while he's doing the sit-ups, his body is, he's tearing his muscles up and their

179
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:50,869
body, they're healing instantly. Wolverine could spend a day, a full day at the gym and do every

180
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:57,990
single body group three times. Jealous. Check his hair. Check hair. What, what, like, what is it

181
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,349
going to be like fucking clean in here? Like, what do you think it was? Check your hair.

182
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:07,930
It's cool. I don't agree. I just took a shower fucking like three, four hours ago or something,

183
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:13,289
whatever it was at 11 45. I remember because I was pissed about daylight savings time. It's

184
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:28,859
done greasy lice. I had to include this one because it's fucking funny. Well, I don't even

185
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:36,940
remember what this is from, but I mean, it's, that's very, very, very fun. I remember that

186
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:42,279
somebody made this within 10 seconds. It's from rhythm heaven. Oh, that was a fucked up stream.

187
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:51,559
That was a weird one. It was like normal. Rhythm heaven was very normal and fun for about four and

188
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:00,410
a half hours. And then it turned into this shit. It was a ton. I had a bunch of fun, but like I,

189
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:14,019
I wasn't doing this in the first four or five hours. Uh, this is from the FTK stream King

190
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,500
Jermo, which by the way, people have been looking for an update on that. Uh, there's currently an

191
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,079
FTK part two that's in development right now. It is not even going to be remotely close to the way

192
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:29,930
that it was before. It's going to be very, very, very different, way different than what you,

193
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:37,049
what you experienced last time. We are changing it completely. We're going to try it. It's still

194
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:45,829
going to be a Minecraft, but the whole idea is going to be a lot more, um, planned and stuck to

195
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:57,579
do. So there will be at least one more of these scripted content. No, I mean, just planned,

196
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:03,099
like not just running around with a stone ax and fucking singing while people try to shoot arrows

197
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:10,309
at me and walking people in little cubes to fight each other. Like it's going to be like stuff to do

198
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:20,859
and not 5,000 people connecting at the same time. Look at this dude. I see this image a lot and I

199
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:36,460
don't really know what it is. This is, this is a Jojo thing. It has to be because of that, right?

200
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:43,900
J omega low J omega low. Uh, I don't know what it's referencing exactly, but people seem to

201
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:56,789
really like this exact scene. Uh, I think we've never seen this one before. We've seen stuff from

202
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:01,190
science before since, and I'm going to, I say it wrong every time and I will always say it wrong.

203
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:07,509
Hard for me to even remember my own friend's names. It's a lie. So like, don't like people like,

204
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,630
well, that's kind of concerning, dude. Like what are you fucking talking about? That's, I'm kidding.

205
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:20,650
It's a joke. Joe the werelord. The werelord has turned into a auto bed. Uh, it's been washed

206
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,049
and it's now autos like coy auto leg loves this thing. He sleeps on it. He plays with it.

207
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:45,930
It's like auto bed now. It's very cute. Tomato flan Leo's. I remember this. This is from the

208
00:31:47,619 --> 00:32:01,859
last, I think. Yeah. Can we go over this breakfast for a second? Uh, more, this is important. So I

209
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,980
don't know who the fuck, there's gotta be some insider bullshit with like the breakfast industry

210
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,220
on how much food and how much shit you're supposed to have out during breakfast time.

211
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:19,900
Right. So when I eat breakfast, if I'm have a bowl of cereal, it's just a bowl of cereal.

212
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:26,569
Go back, go back. What do you mean go back? What, what, what, what happened? What? Oh, whoa, whoa,

213
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:41,430
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Oh, please. You've already seen that one. Anyways, anyways,

214
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:48,940
when I eat a bowl of cereal, I'm done. In fact, sometimes I pour a little too much cereal than I

215
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,900
think I can even eat. And you eat half the bowl of cereal and you look at the rest of the soggy mess

216
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,470
that you've made and you go, Oh, this is fucking, this is gross. I don't even want to eat this.

217
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,069
So you try to, what I try to do now is do a little bit of cereal, a little bit of milk,

218
00:33:02,069 --> 00:33:05,829
eat that first, a little bit of cereal, a little bit of milk, eat that until I'm done.

219
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:10,619
Right. Instead of just dumping a five cups of cereal in a bowl this high.

220
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:16,599
This is what I don't understand. I don't know anyone that's ever done this in their entire life

221
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:22,599
is have a bowl of cereal, eggs, breakfast, whatever. And then have like a buffet of scones

222
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:33,049
and shit on the table. And sorry to sound strange here, but coffee and orange juice,

223
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:39,269
that doesn't mix together very well. What are you taking a sip of orange juice

224
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:44,259
and then taking a sip of your coffee? That's like brushing your teeth and then drinking

225
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,819
orange juice. If you know that combination, it's like a cilantro like instant puke reaction

226
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:55,210
for a lot of people. So what do you drink? You got to drink this first. No, you got this,

227
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:00,970
you got to drink this one first. It's hot and then drink this later. It's room temperature.

228
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:06,950
The whole like complete breakfast is always like three pieces of toast, four scones, three eggs,

229
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:15,670
two pieces of bacon, a full bowl of cereal and oatmeal. What the fuck are you talking about?

230
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,510
I eat one of these in the morning because I don't, in the morning I get like kind of,

231
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,269
I'm not hungry in the morning. I can only eat something light or small or something a little

232
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:29,289
bit. Who eats four danishes for breakfast in the morning and like a full orange juice and a bowl

233
00:34:29,289 --> 00:34:38,019
of fucking tomatoes? Well, this is not, I mean, that's rude. Just like give me a cup of coffee

234
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:42,179
and like maybe some toast with a little bit of fucking jam on it. That's it. Or like a little

235
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,739
bit of cereal. Maybe even like some, just like a smoothie or something. Like this is ridiculous

236
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:52,730
and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of hearing about this. What are you going to do about it?

237
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,250
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm just going to complain to you about it for like 10 minutes

238
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,570
and then forget I even was angry about it in the first place. And then a year will go by

239
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,690
and I'll see it again and it'll irritate me for five minutes again.

240
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:21,530
Take that fucking food industry. Moving on. I don't have to say sorry about that.

241
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:39,269
Hello, you know, small ass Megalop, tiny fuck. Now this is a good one. Half of you don't leave

242
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:59,670
because he's on screen. Literally unintelligible. The down arrows. I can't get over that. It's so

243
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:12,469
funny to me. I wake up laughing at this sometimes. I'm in the shower laughing about this. That was

244
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:17,880
like a big Halloween stream. It was like almost 10,000 fucking people watching that stream and

245
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,599
like five, like four fucking thousand people left. I can't even, I have to talk about it every time

246
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:36,579
because it's fucking hysterical to me. This is great though. This is fantastic. I even forgot,

247
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:45,219
I didn't at one point, wasn't I like eating bugs and stuff? Well, not me, but I saw it on the screen

248
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:53,219
over here. I saw it on, I was watching and I was like, what is he doing over there? What is he

249
00:36:53,219 --> 00:37:02,170
crazy? Wasn't he eating, wasn't he eating bugs in like clay? There was a joke that was supposed to

250
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:09,050
be happening and it might have been too dark, but there were spiders. Little spiders. Look, look, I'm

251
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:21,460
spoiler alert. There were bugs. We had spiders that were on strings and one of the people that

252
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,739
were there, one of the crew was, was going to drag them across the table and I was going to

253
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:41,940
keep eating them and the strings all broke. So we, so I had to try to find ways to eat the spiders

254
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:56,010
and one of them was huge. One of them was this big and before we started, before the stream was live,

255
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,289
I remember the, the production manager was just like, are you, are you, are you, I don't think we

256
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:11,769
can do that. And I'm like, well, yeah, we can. We'll figure it out. We put them on the strings.

257
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:20,039
They were supposed to bounce across the table and like, give it out. Oh, and it didn't work at all.

258
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:27,750
Wait, that was you? I was in, I was a part of the production. I knew this is a person that I hired.

259
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:34,139
This wasn't me. Of course not. It's not fucking me. I will prove it to you guys. I'll prove it to you

260
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:39,670
guys. Don't worry. One day I'll prove this to you that we're not the same person. I will be in the

261
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:50,250
same room with bugleberry on camera. That's not the same person. Big wow chat is big brain chat.

262
00:38:50,250 --> 00:39:04,440
Remember rum layout. Can't, oh, can't remember rum layout. Sorry. No scanner, no scanner. Tag me.

263
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,260
No, I'm shy. Please don't ask for tagging since some tag on purpose. Wait, tag me?

264
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:29,719
Is this me saying this? I like the, I like the, is that, that's supposed to be Kim? I wish I had these.

265
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:46,500
That'd be great. Leg muscles. Holy shit. Whoa. That's, that's some, that's some, that's some

266
00:39:46,500 --> 00:40:00,179
turkey leg right there. That is like a full like Disney turkey leg. Jesus. All right. Nice.

267
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:15,130
Tricked you. Uh, what'd you trick us for? It's Egypt and we're both blog pyros. What is this done

268
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:28,230
with? It's very neat. It's like, it's almost like a crayon. It looks like crayon. Very well done

269
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:36,010
crayon. Crayon brush. That's cool. Don't you want to see this as a, hold on. I have to apply lip balm

270
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:45,659
before I turn into fucking dust. Don't you want to see like a cartoon like this? They already did.

271
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:52,940
What was it? What was it called? Um, uh, what the fuck was it? God. It was like, was it, you know,

272
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,059
a kid that could draw stuff. The Chalk Zone. Yeah, that's what it was. Good thing I wasn't on camera

273
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:11,670
for that embarrassing impression. Yeah, it was, it was Chalk Zone. They still making episodes of that

274
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:23,619
TV show or is it gone forever? What do they still make episodes of? What the fuck is on TV right

275
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:35,559
now? Teen Titans. Well, I could have told you that it was Teen Titans. Teen Titans has turned into

276
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:46,699
the infomercial of Cartoon Network. And what I mean by that is it's on like six straight hours.

277
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:49,900
You know, like when you, when you turn on TV at like one o'clock in the morning, it's infomercials

278
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:57,480
for like seven hours straight. Teen Titans is now the like, we don't know what to put on this block.

279
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,440
It's going to be four or five straight hours of Teen Titans. It's such, it's such a great thing

280
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:17,210
just to have there. It's got the music on here. I don't, that's not, I don't have anything bad to

281
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:23,849
say about Teen Titans. I don't even watch it. I'm just saying, I just, I'll have the TV on. This

282
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:29,369
actually happened very recently. It was like, I thought I was stuck in a fucking time warp

283
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:34,650
because I was drifting off and it was very, very late. I fell asleep and I, well, I put the TV on.

284
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:39,369
So the TV's turned on. It's on Cartoon Network. I was watching like Adult Swim before I fell

285
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:45,989
asleep or something like that. This is in a hotel room. And I remember hearing, okay, and coming up

286
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:52,789
next, we've got Teen Titans Go. Let's get it. Let's go, whatever they do, right? And it was like,

287
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:00,949
Nickelodeon splashes and stuff. And then, okay, I woke me up and I then went back to bed. And then

288
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:08,579
I woke it up by again. All right, Titans, it's time for Teen Titans Go. And I'm like, Teen Titans Go

289
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:17,610
happened again. And I fell back asleep. And this happened like three more times before it was like,

290
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:23,769
okay, Titan Goers, Teen Titans Go coming up next, only on Cartoon Network. And I like grabbed the

291
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:34,059
fucking remote and I was like, shut the fuck up. Turn it off. I thought I could just sleep with

292
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:58,409
this, but no, turn this shit off. What is this? What is it? What are you doing? Okay. So, um,

293
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:30,329
this is a schedule for Cartoon Network. Gumball, Teen Titans Go. This is, it doesn't, yeah, this

294
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:39,559
is real. There are three television shows. Okay, I love Gumball. If there's anything that I think

295
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:48,070
Gumball should have, Gumball should have a block here. Okay. But I mean, when your schedule

296
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,030
on your television network looks like somebody that needs a disc defragmentation,

297
00:44:53,750 --> 00:45:05,349
nothing's probably wrong. I'm just saying. Look at the Christmas one. Hold on, there's a Christmas

298
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:19,699
one. What? Is this a joke? Or is this like somebody fucked this up and made this the way

299
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:49,130
Teen Titans? Oh, Steven Universe! Steven Universe! What time? Friday at 7 30. Whoa. Teen Titans Go

300
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:59,300
Island Adventure. Is that a movie? Cause this is, this is, no, this is, what is this? A movie?

301
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:17,539
It's a 30 minute episode. They made a movie too. Well, um, all right. That was the Cartoon Network

302
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:30,630
schedule. Let's get back to where we were, which I believe wasn't right here. Hey, was it this one?

303
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:50,039
Were we on this one last? Moving on. Jerma and his gamer son. This is from rewatching the Mario RPG

304
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:54,920
Vaude and thought something like this would make 12 year old Jerma pog his ass off.

305
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:15,719
Season 2. Fighter Pass 2. Fighter 1. Travis Touchdown. Fighter 2. Geno. Fighter 3. Beautiful

306
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:39,079
Joe. Fighter 4. Mew 2. Fighter 5. Fire Emblem Carrot. And I don't know which one,

307
00:47:39,900 --> 00:48:12,739
cuz they're all the same. Get a load of this guy. That's not even a hot take. That's not even a

308
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:18,739
hot take. That's not even a hot take anymore. That was a hot take like five months ago,

309
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:23,719
or like a year ago. That's me just being like, hey, like, I'm gonna jump on that thing that

310
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:27,320
people say. Hey, you know that thing about like too many Fire Emblem characters and that they're

311
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,530
all like sword users? Hey, I'm gonna say that now. Aren't I like controversial? And it's like, dude,

312
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:39,750
come on. Somebody made that joke like fucking two years ago. But really though, I hope we don't,

313
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,949
I hope we don't see any more Fire Emblem characters. I hope we don't. I mean, that's

314
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:49,400
Siri. What a cool Siri. Just Super Mario. They don't need more people in it than Super Mario

315
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,460
Brothers. Super Mario Brothers character here, by the way. Super, I haven't seen a new

316
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:03,820
representer for the Mario series in, it's never, it's just Wario. Like Smash Brothers Brawl.

317
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:34,730
Piranha Plant. Fuck! Fuck! Here's Waterman. Delete your stream. Apology. This is cute. This is

318
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:41,639
kind of scary, but it's cute. At the same time, I mean, the rat is cute. Wait, why is it, wait,

319
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:51,960
no, is the rat like sad? What's, wait, what's going on here? What's wrong with me? Let him go,

320
00:49:51,960 --> 00:50:00,469
let him go, let him go. Why, why do I have this impression on people? I do not like this painting,

321
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:22,760
chat. It's smug or mocks me. World War II. World War III. Wait, is that supposed to be just me?

322
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:49,099
I don't understand. I don't understand. Nice baseball. Yeah, unsettling. It's like that,

323
00:50:49,099 --> 00:51:04,039
this, this is like my, I have such an evil presence. Why do I have such an evil fucking

324
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:21,500
presence in every picture? Every time, that Joel Vinesauce, he didn't, he didn't make this.

325
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:34,780
Why would he make this? Why would Joel draw a picture of me, like, very detailed picture of me

326
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:42,179
in a fucking baseball uniform? This is, there's no way this is Joel. He did not make this.

327
00:51:42,820 --> 00:52:01,510
That's so odd. Like, that's so odd. Why would you put this here? This is like a really, like,

328
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:07,349
detailed picture. Joel didn't do this. No, I'm not saying that Joel, like, can't make detailed photos.

329
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:13,210
I'm saying, like, why would he do this? He, like, he doesn't have time for this. He's busy.

330
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:31,849
Call Joel. He's crying. Why not? He didn't draw this. He did not. I've seen Joel's drawings.

331
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:36,550
And by the way, one of them's on here. One of Joel's drawings is actually on here.

332
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:44,519
And it wasn't like me batting detailed. No, it's, it's like, he drew me with these big

333
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:49,320
stacked shoulders and these tiny legs. This is not a Joel photo. This is a fake photo.

334
00:52:50,039 --> 00:53:01,159
He made two. I don't, I don't think he drew this. What if he did? I, that's, I know. What,

335
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:06,199
what if he really did? Somebody find out for me. Like, and I'll hear back. What a fake friend.

336
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:31,480
What? Oh, I love this. He said he did. Did he? Did he actually? Uh, is that true? Yes.

337
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:46,440
Whoa. You go, big guy. Uh, this is the rats. He'd be a rat and fireman. Everybody's lost.

338
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:53,380
Is that guy a triplet of a theme park? Think of how many great theme park characters exist

339
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:01,670
in this community. Can you imagine the rides that could be made over like the rats and fireman and

340
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,349
me? Did you like that little? I just did like a smug neck head.

341
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:22,650
I didn't do that on purpose. This is cute though. Uh, this is, you seem to be a short streamer. Do

342
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:31,260
you need help with that? Yes. Help me or no. This is, uh, from hypnospace, hypnospace outlaw.

343
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:42,789
I look to be in some, in some distraught BWL, right? Uh, get well soon. German from Jude

344
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:51,769
Minecraft. Has to be, gotta put a Garfield in there somewhere. It's cool. Cute. Of course,

345
00:54:51,769 --> 00:55:00,920
there's a rat. Always a rat. Garfield. What was the last Garfield reference? Anybody know?

346
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,530
What was the actual last Garfield reference? Okay. I'm so sorry. Not right. No, no, no. I mean,

347
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:15,619
like a true Garfield is, has a significant time on stream. Um, I was rubbing my face and had an

348
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:30,579
itchy eye. But in like 2018, yeah. Uh, fireman, waterman, earthman, windman. Pretty cute. This

349
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:37,079
is element man. What element am I? Didn't I already do that? This is me eating my own arm.

350
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:45,320
But what was, what element was I? Wasn't I fire or air or something? I was air because I could,

351
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,760
I just like fucking fly around and like float around and I'm like, I'm like this way, that way,

352
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:58,280
this way, that way. Right. And I got like, I'm air, right? Yeah. I'm definitely an air spirit.

353
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,019
Yeah. That's my, my element for sauna is air for sure. Oh, by the way, I'm not even reacting

354
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:11,659
to this on stream. Yes. This is me eating my own arm. But I did this, I was angry at a game

355
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:28,820
and I bit my arm very, very gently. Is that from Mr. Mosquito? Toad lipstick. Somebody will, if you

356
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:36,300
don't, if you just link it, link the clip. We have little, uh, collectible icons. This grandpa.

357
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:47,559
That one just stuck out so much for me. Little like figurines. All right. Let me see if I get,

358
00:56:47,559 --> 00:57:02,090
this is checks. Uh, egg with a bird and eye, sun, moon, chair. Everything is mining of Isaac,

359
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,769
by the way. Like these, I could, I could see me running into a room and picking all these up and

360
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:14,710
then giving like plus like two speed or like plus one damage or something. Oh, that's been on the

361
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:21,880
mind lately. Finding the Isaac's been on my brain every day now. You know what that means?

362
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,900
That means it's time to sit up to play it. I've made, when I start making references to shit,

363
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,699
that's how you know it's time. Although not World of Warcraft because I'm not going to play that

364
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:39,539
again. I don't see something gross. So this is, uh, this is what happens if you let a coffee sip.

365
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:45,059
There's a little bit of almond milk in here and it's turned into that where the coffee is on top

366
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:58,380
and the almond milk is now on the bottom, which now this is a gross drink and the ice has watered

367
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:23,659
it down. Just mix it with my finger. Ballast. Oh, Jeremy, you're not fucking good at anything.

368
00:58:23,659 --> 00:58:28,380
Jeremy, you can't do anything. What do you have like two IQ? I almost just spilled it on myself

369
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:35,860
right there. Uh, this is great though. This is awesome. This is a, uh, re-imagining. I think

370
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:52,380
we've seen this before. This is the most interesting man in the world face. I don't even know why this

371
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:57,980
is here. It's, uh, it's me. I don't even know. I don't know. I guess. Look at that hair though.

372
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:09,400
That's long. It's long now, but that was very long. I look like Wes Anderson. Does he still look like

373
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:21,380
this? Fishy mint. This is a little fireman icons and, uh, chat. This is really cute. I love it.

374
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:36,760
Let's zoom in a little. It's great. Good shit. Here we go from that to this. Okay, if this is

375
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:53,019
like fireman, this is fireman's like evil grandma. Holy shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh those fucking toes.

376
00:59:54,650 --> 01:00:05,239
Oh my God. That's fucking heinous. That is heinous. Oh, this is good though. This is very,

377
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:16,889
very, very good. Whoa. I know what it sounds like too. It's got like what it is like.

378
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:29,000
You think you can stop me? I don't think so. He's got like a, well, I like an Ursula voice. Just,

379
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:47,460
okay, make that talk with a line from Ursula. What do you think this sounds like? Have this lip sync

380
01:00:47,460 --> 01:01:03,380
poor unfortunate souls while walking around and like going like this and like this. That's grandpa.

381
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:19,099
I can't do Ursula. Try. I just did. And apparently everybody fucking hated it. This is Zapman.

382
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:32,650
This is not a fireman, but like with a person's face. Oh, Murius. Always, always up vote Murius

383
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:43,530
under every circumstance. Very cute. Here's the poses that I did that I can never delete.

384
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:53,460
Little did I know. And I remember this stream of picking up a YouTube video

385
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:57,940
and like desperately trying to do these as accurate as possible and not even knowing

386
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:05,670
what I was doing when it's green screen stream too. I don't know. I don't know. I can't.

387
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:12,619
I don't know. I don't know. Once like I feel, I wish I could fucking tell you.

388
01:02:13,659 --> 01:02:17,539
We'll talk about it in a second, but this is pixel art of bugleberry,

389
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:28,550
which is actually pretty good. I like it a lot. Actually it's an emo. It's a little too big for

390
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:33,030
an emo, but I think it specifically said it wasn't supposed to be an emo. They just like doing pixel

391
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:51,699
art. Let's see. I'd be a little too dark. No, maybe not. Like up here and like down here.

392
01:02:55,030 --> 01:03:03,000
I can, I guess, you know, you can see it. It works. Put the candle. It's a discord emo. Oh,

393
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:12,650
okay. Well, that makes sense. You will be flashed. You know, I've thought about what I want to go

394
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:22,179
back to. I really want to go back to light gun stuff. I do, but just so hard to actually capture

395
01:03:22,179 --> 01:03:28,179
that and get it right. If you, if you actually, I don't think it's possible without a CRT TV,

396
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:33,989
CRT TV. And that thing was such a pain in the ass. If that thing's gone forever. No, that,

397
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:43,780
I do not have that TV. That TV, that TV was such a pain in the ass. Seriously. You know how hard

398
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:48,360
that was to get that out of that fucking room? You know how hard it was to get it into the room?

399
01:03:49,079 --> 01:04:03,989
Thing was 400 pounds. What song? This is the Celeste OST. No, it's just, I don't know exactly

400
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:11,260
what song it is. It's just on the OST. Very, very good OST. Very good music in this fucking game.

401
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:19,210
The game's really good too. I think it was fun. It's a fun game. Oh, here are the three,

402
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:28,699
Dick Dastley Richard and the other two that don't have names. This is the only one that had a name.

403
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:38,139
This is cool. I like the coin. Oh, is it? It's a bald coin. It's a bald coin. It's the gang. It's

404
01:04:38,139 --> 01:05:00,869
the gang. The gang's here. Give them names now. I don't know. Fucking Button Up Barry and Dr.

405
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:14,010
Digestion. No, don't leave that. There's more of these. I think this is the, the same group.

406
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:19,480
Put these together. Too late. Too late. Already on the wiki. Too late. Too late. Too late.

407
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:33,210
You know, like the original shitty drawing that I did, that was the thumbnail for all the grandpa

408
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:41,030
videos in like 2011, 2012. That's the original. You drew a face in less than five seconds.

409
01:05:45,059 --> 01:05:51,179
Making an emote. Why would I make this? It's not even relevant anymore. Grandpa is like not a

410
01:05:51,179 --> 01:05:57,380
relevant character. He's been replaced by Bugle. And he's gone. Didn't you see the German Rumble

411
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:13,190
live? He's gone. He's, he's gone. No longer relevant. Snort. He's a demon. Hey, he's back in hell.

412
01:06:15,219 --> 01:06:26,170
He got one opportunity to come through the portal and he fucked it up. He ain't dead. Well, I mean,

413
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:36,150
he's, he's where he is. He had a heart attack. How do you fuck that up? I don't know. He should

414
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:41,030
have been like, he should have been taking like an omega-3 supplement in hell. What am I supposed to

415
01:06:41,030 --> 01:07:01,980
do? What is this? What character is this? Slime man? I love Pac-Man. Pac-Man, I'm starting to

416
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:11,800
realize something. Cheeto is kind of just a zoomer Pac-Man. I'm kind of realizing this.

417
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:28,840
They're both wicked cool. But yeah, wicked cool. What? I'm from fucking Boston, dude. Is that

418
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:42,059
how we fucking talk, dude? This is great though. A little sketch we have. Oh, if you give me that

419
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:47,500
pillow, I'll give you this toothbrush. Okay, just don't tell my dad. See, look, I told you,

420
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:55,269
this is now actually, this is now locked into canon. See, it's a werelord. That's a good trade.

421
01:07:55,269 --> 01:08:05,480
That's not a bad trade. We have Cheeto on the playground with other, that's a J and then

422
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:16,810
a little slug. Oh, is that the snake? This is farmer man, I think is what it was. What the fuck

423
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:22,760
is going on? Hey, hey, how do I get rid of, how do I get rid of the magnifying glass?

424
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:27,189
I have the magnifying glass open right now. You can't see it on your screen. How do I get

425
01:08:27,189 --> 01:09:01,289
rid of the escape? I pressed alt. Hold on, there it is. Okay, that was weird. This works so well.

426
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:18,520
It like, it's perfect. It's like, that's, it's just, it's perfect. What do I, what do you want

427
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:34,920
me to tell you? Here, hey, hey, cheers to that one. Oh sure, okay. A coffee from earlier this

428
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,600
morning and you got another cup because you're a fucking weirdo and didn't put ice and new

429
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:53,350
coffee in this cup. Sure. Cheers to that one. Of course we will. Joel and Jerma, Joel versus

430
01:09:53,350 --> 01:10:05,060
Jerma from the Vine Wrestle. The coffee is fucking vile, dude. No, it's not. That's just coffee.

431
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:10,199
Fucking looks like a little bit of almond milk in it. That's just, that's just coffee. That's just,

432
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:17,000
that's black coffee with like almond milk and then no sugar, no bullshit, no sweetener, no sweetness.

433
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:38,439
Sure, vanilla? I'm gonna add. Although that would be a 10. Uh, here we go. Almond milk is disgusting.

434
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:53,720
Okay, what would I say? Hey, you wouldn't dumb. Don't, hey. That's like, okay, that's like saying

435
01:10:53,720 --> 01:11:01,000
I don't like the color green. All right. Why do you have a green car? I don't like the color green.

436
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:19,979
Uh, is that your car? No. Whose car is it? It's your car. Right, right. Fuck yeah, I don't like

437
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:34,949
that color. That color sucks. Destroyed with facts. That was a bad analogy. No, it's not. It's if you

438
01:11:34,949 --> 01:11:40,489
don't like the color green, I don't give a shit. I like the color green. It's not your car, motherfucker.

439
01:11:41,050 --> 01:12:10,380
Stretch is squish. I love the stretch. It's just like happy rat lunar year. Oh my goodness. This is,

440
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:16,729
this is cool. This is cool. Right? You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? You know what I'm

441
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:23,960
saying? Right? You know what I mean? Should learn words at the end of sentences. Oh, this is cool.

442
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:33,779
I like it. Uh, this is, this is the chat fursona apparently. Um, why, why do I, this is like,

443
01:12:35,859 --> 01:12:43,449
this right here and this. Wouldn't it somewhere else? Chat rat. Chat's official fursona is here

444
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:50,250
at long last. Evil. Greasy. Something. All right. Where's bag to honor dick dastardly? And it's,

445
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:58,729
I don't, I hate this word. I hate that word. You know, there's some, like we, there's some words

446
01:12:58,729 --> 01:13:02,970
that, that, that you, that you just hate the way they sound. You don't like even saying them or

447
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:10,840
hearing them. Like I can't even say it. I hate it. I hate the way it sounds. It's like, it's like,

448
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:19,159
I hate it. I can't say it. I can't say it. Stinky. Oh, I fucking hate that word. I hate that word.

449
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:31,180
Smelly is a little better, but, oh, that's the most unpleasant sounding word in the English

450
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:43,829
language. Stinky. Stinky. I'm done. This is a lot of stuff going on in here. There's the FTK stream.

451
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:53,289
It's moist. No, it's not moist. It's fine. Moist. You know why moist is perfectly fine? Because when

452
01:13:53,289 --> 01:14:02,020
I think of the word moist, I think of, I think of a cake and I think of fork. I think, I see a

453
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:09,619
fork pressing down on a cake and the cake like smushing and getting coagulated into the fork

454
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,460
and then suddenly the fork going in and picking up the piece of cake. That's, that's what I see

455
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:20,100
when I hear the word moist. I think of a pound cake that you put in your mouth and it just like

456
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:28,439
smushes down in your gums and teeth and shit. When I think of the word stinky, I think of

457
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:47,750
like dirty laundry. Like, oh, like a diaper. Like, oh, stinky. Oh, no, like a diaper.

458
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:55,989
Go like cat litter. Yeah. Like, oh, let's stinky cat litter. Oh, fuck that word. That word sucks.

459
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,670
All right. Let's go. This is great though. Oh, wait, wait. I want to see what a

460
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:12,579
$75,000 for this. It's pretty cheap though, don't you think? Look, more, more evidence.

461
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:18,819
Look, I told you guys. I think that this, this probably, this probably a picture of this somewhere.

462
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:26,819
You're the rat. This is really, really good. This is like really, really detailed.

463
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:34,119
Really nice work. Show the picture. I don't have the picture available to me.

464
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:51,319
This is manga, anime, and then the Netflix adaptation. It's pretty good. Pretty good.

465
01:15:52,869 --> 01:16:01,640
There it is. See, this is Joel. Joel Vinesauce drew this one. Not like the guy with the,

466
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:10,789
not the bat one. That's a different style. Is this supposed to be me or Joel? That's me, right? Of

467
01:16:10,789 --> 01:16:21,689
course it is. I, that's my fucking body type. Here is a, just a rat. Or you're the rat. I like

468
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:32,630
this. You know, this is like my, one of my favorite colors. Of course it is. Of course it is.

469
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:46,760
I am exhibit A. I love this light sort of teal aqua green experiment kind of green,

470
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:54,119
like teal into spearmint. I could look at this all day. I know what this smells like. You know

471
01:16:54,199 --> 01:17:01,319
what I mean? This has a smell. It's like a clean, fresh laundry smell. It's like a minty laundry

472
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:06,520
air, like opening up your window on a fucking cool afternoon in the fall.

473
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:16,069
No, not, not that word. I know this color has a smell and this color has a taste.

474
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:21,510
Look at this. Look at my, look at my shirt and imagine what it tastes like.

475
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:35,109
See? It's not mint. It's like a freshness. Like a pistachio ice cream kind of freshness.

476
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:57,859
So this is the, it's mint. It's not mint. There are other things that are light green that aren't

477
01:17:57,859 --> 01:18:37,430
bubble gum. Like, like the green milkshake from Sonic. It's like the St. Patrick's Day milkshake

478
01:18:37,430 --> 01:19:00,460
from Sonic. Eat that, food industry. It's mint. It's literally mint. No, it's, it's whatever.

479
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,659
Toothpaste, toothpaste, toothpaste. No, toothpaste is like toothpaste. It's like frozen. It's like

480
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:11,779
blue and no, no, and tooth, most toothpaste is just white. All right. I, I gotta talk about some

481
01:19:11,779 --> 01:19:19,060
stuff. Moving on. This is the bet that we had between me and Joel when we did keep talking

482
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:27,140
and nobody explodes, which was, I had to eat like a quadruple bypass burger. I haven't, I haven't

483
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:32,119
done that yet. Oh no, I had to put it in my underwear. I didn't have to put one of these in

484
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:46,649
my underwear. I'm not going to do that. So like, that was like a joke that we did. Wait, didn't,

485
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:56,119
didn't he, did he eat like a bunch of raw eggs? Wait, it's not a scam unless, unless he did his

486
01:19:56,119 --> 01:20:07,560
part. He actually ate a bunch of raw eggs. He did. That's not good. That's not okay. Don't do that.

487
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:17,449
You need to steam them first so you can get rid of the bacteria. Uh, I'll put a fucking hamburger

488
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:24,119
down my underwear in like, I don't know, like a couple years or something. Here's a rat. That's

489
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:38,340
me on the rat's nose because you know, this one's clever. This is the LGBT pose. I thought it was

490
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:53,960
clever. It's very clever. I get it. I get it. Yeah, it's like, it's clever. This shit's clever.

491
01:20:56,229 --> 01:21:09,319
This is Batman. What is this? Is this, no, this is Joel. Oh, that's Joel. That's me and Joel. I

492
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:19,880
thought I was holding a, I thought, I didn't know what this was. All right. I, I was just sweating.

493
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:45,220
Clock. The omega symbol. Right, right, right. Hey, this is really good though. Thank you.

494
01:21:46,300 --> 01:22:02,939
This one's fucked. Look at how fucked up this is. This is the janitor smashing your fucking head

495
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:32,970
with the, this is, this is insane. What? That's, that was really good. It's cute. Come on.

496
01:22:52,170 --> 01:23:02,659
New emote. A new walking emote? Will it be Fireman walk? I feel like, I think we've seen this image

497
01:23:02,659 --> 01:23:09,939
before, but it's still, this is, this is the like, you're the baby, right? This is like the,

498
01:23:09,939 --> 01:23:14,739
you opened your eyes for the first time and like, like dads, you're the baby in my arms, right?

499
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:19,689
Did we do something weird? I don't remember any. I don't remember what we did two days ago.

500
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:32,020
Nice fucking neck. What you meant to say was, why does it look like my nose and right eye have been

501
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:50,729
photoshopped into this photo? Here is, uh, German Wars, The Rat Awakens. Which is pretty good.

502
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:59,340
I love lightsabers. Remind me, please, when I eventually do get in front of the green screen

503
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,859
again, I know I've been putting off for a long fucking time, but I, I know there's a whole thing

504
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:11,020
that's a suggestion, but please remind me that when we do it again, I want to get a fake lightsaber

505
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:17,739
thing and I want to do a full on like lightsaber actual like, and I want, I need it. I need it just

506
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:24,699
for me. I want a full lightsaber event that I'm going to do with like 20 lightsaber different

507
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:32,199
things. I want all lightsabers. Make sure the lights, the lightsabers green. Yeah. I want a

508
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:39,060
full on green lightsaber. Roll eats an egg. Hold on. I'll look at it in a second, but this is,

509
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:49,560
this is pretty cool. All the Jojo poses. Hey, look, it's a little rat. Not green at a blend in.

510
01:24:50,979 --> 01:25:07,140
Have Bugleberry be on it and give him a Darth Maul lightsaber. Maybe.

511
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:17,829
Rep in the fireman shirt. This is good shit. Animal crossing. Oh yeah, that is cool. That's

512
01:25:17,829 --> 01:25:27,189
like an animal crossing. This is cool. I didn't even realize that. Here is, I don't know,

513
01:25:28,069 --> 01:25:34,630
but looks good. Am I going to play, I'll play the one on Switch when it comes out.

514
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:49,130
I love the hat. You got the carnival hat in here. Why is there a reason? Oh, because I said I was

515
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:58,859
going to play Odd Michael. Hey. Oh, not quite. A little too green. Good shit. Can't wait for you

516
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:03,819
to play it. This is, I zoomed in a little too much, but this is some pixel art of the J.

517
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:10,149
Yeah, I'll play the Switch one. When does it come out? I don't want to play the old ones,

518
01:26:10,149 --> 01:26:17,619
but I want to play the new one. Comes out in 12 days. What? Holy shit. Yeah, let's go.

519
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:24,460
Look, I'll play the fuck out of that game. Comes out the same day as Doom Eternal.

520
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:51,699
Oh. Now I'll play an animal crossing first. We'll do Doom Eternal afterwards. I look like the villain

521
01:26:52,869 --> 01:27:02,739
in two or three specific Goosebumps books. This is like what, this is what the bad kid turns into,

522
01:27:02,739 --> 01:27:29,109
right? At what point did everyone agree in media that this was how a vampire was, you know what

523
01:27:29,109 --> 01:27:40,329
I mean? Why are their hands curled like this? These long fingernails, they curve their arms.

524
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:52,619
It's just odd. A bat. Oh, right, because bats. Shit, that's right. How come in Twilight they

525
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:58,439
weren't walking around like, but I don't get, there's vampires. Why did we get rid of it?

526
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:09,020
Why didn't Robert Pattinson not have a big long mouth and shit?

527
01:28:11,989 --> 01:28:32,060
There's a sex appeal. It's not supposed to be scary. Twilight isn't about vampires. Yes,

528
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:43,239
it is. It's about the eternal conflict between vampires and werewolves. No, that's Underworld.

529
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:49,380
What the fuck happens in Twilight? I don't know what it is. I've never seen it. I mean,

530
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:59,060
I know what it is, but what's the premise of Twilight? Okay, okay, Twilight. Spoiler alert

531
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:03,300
for Twilight, but who cares? If you're gonna, if you're not, do I really give a shit about

532
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:15,180
spoiling Twilight? All right, Twilight is, Robert Pattinson is a sparkly vampire and he bites,

533
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:26,899
he bites that girl and then she becomes vampire too. And then there's also that other guy who's

534
01:29:27,619 --> 01:29:38,359
Taylor and he's a vampire. I know he's a werewolf, right? And they kind of like each other,

535
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:52,390
kind of, pretending to not know. I actually, I know I saw somebody say this and you're completely

536
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:58,869
accurate. I have to give credit to what creditors do. Somebody said this is like 2008, like 2010

537
01:29:58,869 --> 01:30:04,390
tier, like jokey reference to something. Like dude, this is like something, like this is like a joke

538
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:10,869
from 10 fucking years ago. I know, but remember I'm late to everything. I played Super Mario

539
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:19,479
Sunshine for the first time ever four days ago. So, I mean, I'm late to literally everything.

540
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:35,239
So anyways, yeah, I've never seen it. I don't plan on seeing it. Anyways, vampire, T-O-D-W,

541
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:40,600
too long, didn't watch the whole stream. Vampires, they've got to go back to being fucking weird and

542
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:57,529
creepy and scary like this. Year of the 2020 rat Reddit streamer. Oh, look at this up in the

543
01:30:57,529 --> 01:31:11,350
champagne and dancing. That's what they do best. This is so cute. Zoom in on that watermark. Who

544
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:33,590
is it? Wait, wait, did the I will never stop it song come up? I think it did. Hey, look at that.

545
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:48,149
Who's that? Close. Not quite. Oh, it is that song. It is the song, the best singing of 2019, right?

546
01:31:51,159 --> 01:32:02,119
What a cute compact streamer. This is my face mixed with Jim Carrey's face.

547
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:08,949
The first thing I thought of was I thought it was one of those, this is not a real person,

548
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:25,159
AI generated people, but apparently this is me and Jim Carrey put together, which is odd because I

549
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:49,109
I'm not sure where I am. Up here and like into here, mouth and eyes. It's been blended together

550
01:32:49,109 --> 01:33:00,140
and that's definitely forehead, right? Cause up here he is listening to farting and screaming.

551
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:21,960
No, no, no, no. This is good shit. Why does he have a cold? That's, that's me crying.

552
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:35,770
You got the one earbud accurate and the shirt's pretty accurate too. Oh, what a fucking nightmare

553
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:50,409
that was. Hey, fireman, look at this dude. Take a look. I like the hair on this one. This is like,

554
01:33:50,409 --> 01:34:04,060
this is a fireman with gel. The fireman that styled the fire. He's going out tonight. Very

555
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:19,420
cute. There's another one. Gaze upon man. What is the, if not an eternal flame? It's like a

556
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:41,500
charcoaly. Uh, charcoal. What? I just said it was like charcoal kind of. Art words. Art words.

557
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:52,220
It's very good. Oh, here's an album. It's called E-Clown. Uh, we have a parental advisory on this.

558
01:34:52,939 --> 01:34:59,739
Side A, we have Michael Berry Bush favorite breakfast material. Bonk, booze, bam.

559
01:35:00,619 --> 01:35:08,229
Booze, bonk, bam. Acid base. On the other side is pirate spy, rat burger, giant enemy spider,

560
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:16,500
MLG grandpa, and free shit. I hope this was not more than $4. Uh, because some of these are just

561
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:22,170
like audio files of me saying two words. There were like three songs on this whole album,

562
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:32,539
one of which I stole from somebody else. TF2 radio, 2020. All rights of the produced and owner

563
01:35:32,539 --> 01:35:37,979
of the work reproduced reserve. Unauthorized copying, hiring, lending. Public, I tricked you.

564
01:35:37,979 --> 01:35:58,470
It's Egypt and we're both vlog pyros. Pretty good. Oh, no wait. He's confirmed. Too bad it's not

565
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:18,199
glue, man. This is adorable. I love it. Very, very clean. You know what I mean? The muscle work back

566
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:34,979
here. The muscle work here. Another fucking Jerma character shaking my head. That's fat. No, it's

567
01:36:34,979 --> 01:36:42,100
not. That's back muscle. I have that same thing. It starts like here and goes like hump back and

568
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:54,010
there's like another hump. I have the same thing. It's fucking muscle. I don't even know why you

569
01:36:54,010 --> 01:37:05,109
made this. Like what did all this is, is an embarrassment when somebody comes over that

570
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:13,899
doesn't know what this is. This is like a, oh, that's on your desk. And it's funny until somebody

571
01:37:13,899 --> 01:37:18,460
like you make a new friend or like maybe like a love interest comes over. And it's like,

572
01:37:19,739 --> 01:37:26,899
what the fuck is this thing? Are we going to rip it up? Like, oh, that's a joke. That's a streamer

573
01:37:26,899 --> 01:37:35,369
that I, uh, uh. What do you say to this? No, I know, I know this little guy on the internet.

574
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:51,699
Love interest, omega low. Love interest, omega low. Love interest. What are you talking about?

575
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:15,979
The sun goes down. Actual psycho Disney villain. Yeah, this is the point in the Disney movie when

576
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:24,489
the handsome guy that was a villain, kind of in the first hour of the movie,

577
01:38:25,529 --> 01:38:32,170
you're like, oh, he's kind of a bad guy. And then like the, this is the finale where there's a big

578
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:36,170
fight with like a knife or something. There's a weapon involved here and it's like, Holy shit.

579
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:41,770
This is, this is like a rotten evil fucking evil person. And they do that evil face and shit.

580
01:38:42,409 --> 01:38:48,409
A knife. Yeah. Isn't there, Disney wouldn't allow, what are you talking about? There's knives.

581
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:56,859
There's a knife in Aladdin. There's a fucking knife. There's a, there's a knife threat in Aladdin.

582
01:38:56,859 --> 01:39:03,899
So I don't know what you're talking about. Not only is there a knife, there's a, there's a, like,

583
01:39:03,899 --> 01:39:10,060
I'm going to stab you in the head. It's a threat. Like I'm coming. I'm going to come down and stab

584
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:29,210
you in the fucking head. That happens in Aladdin. Your eternal reward. There you go. There you go.

585
01:39:30,090 --> 01:40:02,810
This is fucking awesome. Real face. Oh, this is you without makeup on.

586
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:10,890
No, that's, that's like my skin's been taken off and draped over a mannequin head.

587
01:40:13,449 --> 01:40:24,810
That's what this looks like. Link the actual, link the face. Somebody link an image of that.

588
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,739
So for people that don't know what the fuck this is. It's so fucking ridiculous.

589
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:48,489
This is 3d fireman mapped on a 3d plane in a 3d program.

590
01:40:54,489 --> 01:40:59,770
How big is this though? This looks like it could be huge. Is it like a giant statue or is it little?

591
01:41:05,289 --> 01:41:21,380
Very cool. This is huge. Okay. This is boomer, boomer germa. Fucking mega milk thing, man.

592
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:24,500
God, I got to like, I got to like delete, I got to like stop this out.

593
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:37,529
I can't have that be like connected to the community. Oh, fireman. The rats. Oh, that like,

594
01:41:37,529 --> 01:41:44,170
oh, the thing face. Mega milk. Okay. At some point you've got to like, we've got to steer the

595
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:57,720
community in a different direction. Like at some point this has to change. Nice baseball.

596
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:12,619
Germa versus jump king. Wait, germa minus two, jump king plus two. Why is that, why is this,

597
01:42:12,619 --> 01:42:22,149
why would it be plus two? Oh no, the base, the baseball has a, the baseball is sentient.

598
01:42:22,149 --> 01:42:51,060
Is this fireman? Because you are minus two. This is sick though. Oh, sick! The entire fireman

599
01:42:51,939 --> 01:43:14,140
family. Let's see who made it. The best part is they're all drawn out except this one is just

600
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:21,560
that face just pasted on here and smoothed in with bald head. One of these is not like the other.

601
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:40,680
No. And hey, there we are at the art segment here. We have about, now we have about 50 or 60 videos

602
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:49,939
to look at. Something like that. Perfect music. Well, the music isn't going to turn off. Good

603
01:43:49,939 --> 01:43:58,260
shit. Thank you everybody for submitting artwork. You guys are fucking awesome. There's still a

604
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,939
shitload of stuff that's in that channel that we have to get through. So I've got to figure out

605
01:44:01,939 --> 01:44:07,579
how we can do it smoothly. We are going to go to the video section, but I'm going to pee first,

606
01:44:07,579 --> 01:44:12,060
so I'm going to take a minute or two break here and we'll come back with the videos.

607
01:44:12,869 --> 01:48:21,029
I'll be right back. Okay. Let's turn this music off. Oops a daisy. All right. So let us begin

608
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:28,840
our, what is this? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

609
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:41,300
It's like, this is every single chat message. I'd never say this to his face, but he's a wonderful

610
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:52,500
person and a gifted streamer. It says lewd and rude. I would never say this to his face.

611
01:48:53,140 --> 01:49:04,229
I would never say this to his face. That's so funny. That's fucking funny. I'd never tell him,

612
01:49:04,229 --> 01:49:11,270
but well, thank you for that. We're going to start now. We're going to start with a video

613
01:49:11,989 --> 01:49:18,970
that we talked about previously already is called the, the speedy Grinner. Get ready for the,

614
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:24,569
this section of the stream. We potentially be VOD watchers. Sorry, but some of these are probably

615
01:49:24,569 --> 01:49:37,050
like movie clips and YouTube videos. So sorry, VOD watchers. Let's begin. The first video is,

616
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:52,409
like I said, the greedy, the speedy Grinner.

617
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:33,770
How the fuck is this a trailer for a show?

618
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:34,329
Oh, that was so loud. What the fuck was that? Oh, is this video over? Oh, what the fuck?

619
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:57,699
What is speedy Grinner 2? Is this even supposed to be me? No, this is spoilers. Spoilers. No,

620
01:51:57,699 --> 01:52:09,050
this is spoilers. All right. I'm going to put it in a new tab. Hold on. Let me get this in a new tab.

621
01:52:09,050 --> 01:52:26,420
Okay. Don't spoil the movie. All right. Is this one going to be as loud or we might as well just

622
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:35,079
play this one right now. All right. We're playing this one now. It's a speedy Grinner 2. What am I

623
01:52:35,079 --> 01:52:40,039
going to do? Not play the fucking sequel immediately after the first one. Here we go.

624
01:52:58,550 --> 01:53:01,590
Spoiler for the flash.

625
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:51,180
I'm

626
01:53:51,180 --> 01:54:12,140
just squeaking.

627
01:54:41,449 --> 01:55:07,220
This is like how the show ends. What the fuck? Holy shit. Hopefully nobody cares about that show.

628
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:14,409
All right. I got to make, I got an actual warning. We have to do this warning

629
01:55:14,409 --> 01:55:19,770
every single time, every community content fucking night. Like if you ever have any plans

630
01:55:19,770 --> 01:55:25,449
of watching any television for the next like six months, just, just leave now. Like, I mean,

631
01:55:25,449 --> 01:55:35,939
like seriously, like this is, we spoil so many TV shows and so many movies. Just give you a

632
01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:45,140
warning right now. Moving on to the next one. The next one is called, uh, this is scary.

633
01:55:45,939 --> 01:56:07,020
This one's fucking scary. Just watch it. Okay. I'm done with this one. I'm done with this one.

634
01:56:10,819 --> 01:56:18,630
Okay. That's it for that one. This one's called Jerma toilet.

635
01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:28,520
Hey, your memories have arrived. Huh? That's real cute. Photo dome. Hey, here you go.

Got a picture of the toilet. Hey, here you go. Got a picture of the toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:46,659
the toilet, like literally like drinking like toilet, like the water in the toilet.

Very fucking disgusting. Tastes like somebody's asshole.

01:57:58,069 --> 01:58:08,819
Oh my God. Um, that is what my whole looks like. Oh, that was fucking, this is 10 out of 10.

650
01:58:09,779 --> 01:58:20,789
If you'd like the link to this one, here it is. Oh my goodness. That was fucking wild.

651
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:34,489
Just wild, man. Uh, this next one is called Jerma gets heckled. Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.

652
01:58:37,979 --> 01:58:39,180
Ladies and gentlemen.

653
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:50,409
You know what's funny? I actually had to sign an agreement.

654
01:58:50,489 --> 01:58:54,569
Are we ready? I don't know what we're ready for, Jeremy. Extreme filler for untrained,

655
01:58:54,569 --> 01:59:00,409
unprofessional losers. You fucking wanker. Oh yeah, yeah. You're here with like your

656
01:59:00,409 --> 01:59:06,890
drunk, ugly ass friends, huh? Why don't you come up here and try? You think it's so easy.

657
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:11,210
You little shit. I'm going to strangle your parents. Okay. That's what's going to happen.

658
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:14,409
Like you'll fit in that parking lot. You'll make as big as the parking lot.

659
01:59:14,409 --> 01:59:18,569
You want to get your fucking turkey roasted. I think he's got his ultimate.

660
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:41,130
That was crack. That was just crack. Oh, you want to get your turkey roasted?

661
01:59:42,869 --> 01:59:47,510
Guys, I can't, I've said some, just, I don't know. How many, do you want me to explain that?

662
01:59:48,939 --> 01:59:56,310
That was like from like a 2012 Huntsman video. I can't even tell you what that meant. It meant

663
01:59:56,310 --> 02:00:00,710
like, I'm going to like, you're going to, you're, you're cooked. Like you're done. It's over.

664
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:14,649
You know what I mean? I have no idea. Oh, this one's called shoot him jump. The rhythm heaven.

665
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:52,920
Looks like it could be pretty interesting. Let's take a look. Oh, this is cool. This is

666
02:00:52,920 --> 02:01:30,340
awesome. That was the hard one. That was the hard one. Thanks for watching. Thanks for making.

667
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:43,750
No dupes. Hard making of this. Fuck. That's a big, look at how big that is. Oh, that was awesome.

668
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:51,270
It was actually very, very well made. This one's called, uh, stimulate your senses.

669
02:01:55,159 --> 02:01:57,079
How it feels to chew five gum.

670
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:14,630
All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to do this one again. How it feels to chew

671
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:42,539
five gum. Well, that was fucking awesome. This one's called, uh, Yugi summons Jerma. Remember,

672
02:02:42,539 --> 02:02:46,060
if you've, if you ever plan on watching television for any series ever made,

673
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:49,340
you can't watch these streams. Okay.

674
02:02:59,899 --> 02:03:29,220
Of course. Of course it was. Why would it be anything else? God, this is called a normal

675
02:03:29,220 --> 02:03:49,180
windy night. Normal windy night. Oh, it's a scary one. I'm going to be in the woods and I'm going

676
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:55,100
to like, it's going to be the, all right, here comes another dinosaur. Here comes a dinosaur.

677
02:03:55,659 --> 02:04:29,220
Here comes sword streamer. You serious? Oh, you kept me watching. That's for sure.

678
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:49,500
You kept me watching. That's for sure. This is called average day for Jerma. Two beds.

679
02:05:05,909 --> 02:05:13,140
Wait, the, the mirror of my arms, not lifting up. It's not even a mirror.

680
02:05:28,659 --> 02:05:39,220
Oh no, it's raining outside. I hate this. I hate this. This is terrible.

681
02:06:02,489 --> 02:06:12,710
Dude, people use, you know what I've noticed? Uh, so what, like two years ago, whatever it was,

682
02:06:12,710 --> 02:06:18,180
like a year and a half ago, almost two years ago, that I went in front of the green screen.

683
02:06:19,979 --> 02:06:28,310
This, this below your nose one is, it was like six hours of footage. This appears in so many

684
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:35,720
places. It was just a one-off, just a little throw away, 10 seconds and so funny. Just people

685
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:45,270
use this one thing everywhere. It makes me laugh every fucking time. And the puke one too. Yeah.

686
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:55,720
God, it's fucking funny. This next one is, is guaranteed that I'll like it because as you saw

687
02:06:55,720 --> 02:07:02,840
last community content night, um, I, I mentioned the baseball video was my favorite green screen

688
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:10,220
thing. And what do you know? Here we are. Uh, JLB highlights Elbertson blasts a walk-off slam.

689
02:07:10,939 --> 02:07:15,020
Every 20th for Janssen here in the ninth inning.

690
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:52,899
What is this?

691
02:07:52,979 --> 02:07:53,539
Is this another,

692
02:08:14,420 --> 02:08:15,859
nobody down there.

693
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:28,149
Hold on.

694
02:08:28,149 --> 02:08:47,960
The 20th, I love the baseball one. There's so much. I love them. I just want to see this part

695
02:08:47,960 --> 02:09:06,149
right here.

696
02:09:11,989 --> 02:09:20,069
And imagine like a fucking, imagine we live in like a hundred years ago and like the,

697
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:27,579
there was no such thing as like green screen footage. Man, we truly live in the best time.

698
02:09:27,659 --> 02:09:53,619
You know what I mean? This one's called DJ Jerma. Oh God. Wait, didn't we already see this?

699
02:09:57,420 --> 02:10:14,279
I think we've already seen this one. Okay. Uh, this is a ha ha Jerma walk funny.

700
02:10:14,279 --> 02:10:41,560
I got on the top rope. Why am I running a fucking moron? I don't walk like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

701
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:55,989
All right. Yeah. Nah, it's all right. This one's called Jerma, but it's half life sound effects.

702
02:10:55,989 --> 02:11:14,119
Hey, step off buddy. Don't tick me off. Gordon. What? Oh shit. Major fracture detected.

703
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:36,899
Let's try this. Ah, Freeman. Who is responsible for this? Theoretically. Yes. As I expected.

704
02:11:37,859 --> 02:11:39,779
Do you know who ate all the doughnuts?

705
02:11:47,159 --> 02:11:50,039
Major fracture detected. No.

706
02:11:59,060 --> 02:11:59,619
That was rude.

707
02:12:11,829 --> 02:12:18,630
They'll all go and they'll sit down and be like, and then you have your attention. Oh my God.

708
02:12:22,149 --> 02:12:28,739
That was really, that was very clever. I liked it. That was very good.

709
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:36,939
Clever use of sound effects. Here's a link to that. A lot of people looking for it.

710
02:12:36,939 --> 02:12:44,710
There it is. That was very good. The thing with half life sound effects is probably fucking

711
02:12:44,710 --> 02:12:54,789
ridiculous. All right. This is a, this is the, called the death of Jerma 985.

712
02:12:55,829 --> 02:13:06,949
But as of the first frame you can see here, this is a, this is a Mr. Peanut joke. So yeah,

713
02:13:09,369 --> 02:13:12,619
can't wait for this one. Here we go.

714
02:13:22,420 --> 02:13:32,550
Oh, you let go. Hey, Mr. Peanut. No, you don't. Don't do it.

715
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:59,159
Holy shit, it worked. I feel fine. Maybe you'll be all right. Maybe not.

716
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:15,159
This is the next one. What the fuck? What the hell was that? What the fuck?

717
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:33,770
Spoilers, maybe. Uh, it's, we're getting political presidential candidates.

718
02:14:34,789 --> 02:14:41,430
Political spoilers. Uh, this one's called the Jerma ball, the streak. Yes. More baseball. Yes.

719
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:47,350
I can't wait. This is, this one's long too. Holy shit. This one's long. This is called the streak.

720
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:58,949
We use the sample of your DNA to clone a bunch of players. Hey, where are you going?

721
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:11,020
It's off the scoreboard and they can't get it in time.

722
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:18,859
Two runs are in. The big rats are back. The rats have flick-shotted their way from last place to

723
02:15:18,859 --> 02:15:26,680
first in the AL West. That's somebody's asshole. I hope it's not mine. No, that's mine.

724
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:33,239
Something strange is now happening in Las Vegas. Well, there ain't nothing in the rule book that

725
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:39,239
says you can't have a team full of clowns. They don't, yeah. Making a joke out of the American

726
02:15:39,239 --> 02:15:46,840
league. When is there even a major league baseball team in Las Vegas anyway? 16 consecutive games,

727
02:15:46,840 --> 02:15:56,170
fucking streak in baseball folks in 25 years are screaming and farting.

728
02:16:01,659 --> 02:16:08,420
This team was written off. None of this makes any sense. Can't be how it happens.

729
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:14,899
Drew slugging fastballs. This team has cracked the case wide open on baseball.

730
02:16:15,859 --> 02:16:23,899
Finishing Dark Souls three on stream was all time number 17. The Vegas Rathletics are now

731
02:16:23,899 --> 02:16:31,180
two wins away from tying the American league record. 20 wins in a row doesn't seem so impossible

732
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:38,409
anymore. They're really going up the top rope here and the league can't take it. The age of

733
02:16:38,409 --> 02:16:44,010
the Boston Float today. They're the biggest deal since Jerma Rumble live action. These guys are

734
02:16:44,010 --> 02:16:50,950
laughing. Oh yeah, they could have cloned Reggie or Ricky or Giambi, but instead they chose this

735
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:58,969
weirdo from Boston. But hey, the results don't lie. This dude's fucked. Some teams are trolling

736
02:16:58,969 --> 02:17:05,209
millions of dollars at players, but these guys are paying the same in bits. This isn't just some

737
02:17:05,209 --> 02:17:11,530
kind of currency, you know? Not a big deal. Not a big deal at all. Because what I would say,

738
02:17:11,530 --> 02:17:18,889
if what was occurring here made any sense at all, but it doesn't. The statistics don't work here.

739
02:17:18,889 --> 02:17:30,500
This is bigger than us. Up the middle the rats have won 19 in a row. The 1906 White Sox and the 1947

740
02:17:30,579 --> 02:17:47,370
Yankees have come. They're going to the road. That's making all of the rules. The giant enemy slider.

741
02:17:56,100 --> 02:18:08,379
Wait, what happened? Why did we lose? What? The giant enemy slider. The giant enemy slider?

742
02:18:09,180 --> 02:18:17,459
The Pittsburgh pinwheels.

743
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:27,049
I gotta say the best 10 seconds of this whole video is the birds and the fucking

744
02:18:27,049 --> 02:18:33,850
the tomahawk swing not even in the right spot. I gotta see it again. But these guys are paying

745
02:18:33,850 --> 02:18:39,540
the same in bits. This isn't just some kind of currency thing, you know? Not a big deal.

746
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:45,540
Not a big deal at all. Because what I would say, if what was occurring here made any sense...

747
02:18:46,739 --> 02:18:50,739
This was fucked. I loved it. This is fucking perfect.

748
02:18:53,930 --> 02:19:04,760
All the like the voice work. That was a fully scripted out voice. That was perfect.

749
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:18,520
Oh man. That was hamster pie. Hamster pie. You're here right now. I'm not sure. I mean this video,

750
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:27,659
we're about 30 days behind. So it fucking is hilarious. Oh my god. All right. Moving on.

751
02:19:27,659 --> 02:19:36,409
Let's keep it rolling. We have... Oh yes. Oh man. Are we gonna have back-to-back fucking

752
02:19:37,450 --> 02:19:42,170
baseball or Star Wars? You've got my attention. I know I should probably... It's just true. It's

753
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:47,530
real. Okay. You want me to not... It's real. This is Compact Jedi and Sidekick Ninja Turtle

754
02:19:47,530 --> 02:20:00,659
take on Sith Lord. Star Wars Episode 3 spoilers. I love this shit, man. I love this shit.

755
02:20:50,280 --> 02:21:43,239
Oh man. No hesitation. And it was the baseball swing. I can't wait to get back in front of this

756
02:21:43,239 --> 02:21:48,120
fucking thing, man. I gotta like... This like rib cage problem. Gotta get the fuck out of here.

757
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:52,309
I want to do like another eight hours in front of this thing. You know what I mean? Like

758
02:21:52,629 --> 02:21:56,950
this is so... This is... You guys are so creative and so... Where you use this shit,

759
02:21:56,950 --> 02:22:00,149
it's fucking hysterical. I gotta get the fuck in front of this thing again.

760
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:09,959
It's been like a year and a half. Oh man. Good shit. Keep going. This is uh...

761
02:22:11,239 --> 02:23:13,020
Jerma and the Wizard of Oz. Jesus Christ. That was all over the place. But it was good. It was

762
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:20,520
very, very good. This is Anthony Bantony exposed by hidden camera. And this is shocking.

763
02:23:41,989 --> 02:23:58,340
What was this? What program was this made in? What was this? It was like... What animation

764
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:12,600
was political? That wasn't political. That wasn't political. This is called uh... This is just a D

765
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:21,510
face. Oh, you want to fight? You want to fucking fight me? Don't fucking come at me. Don't...

766
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:36,219
This next one is called... Streamer becomes psychotic barbarian in virtual reality.

767
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:43,510
I've made it to the zone, the play area, and I'm ready to fucking go nuts.

768
02:24:46,219 --> 02:24:55,500
Excellent. Hello. Jeremy. I'm Genghis Khan. You go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat.

769
02:24:55,500 --> 02:25:16,500
I'm wild. I'm like a cave fucking beast. Eat this you fucking celery bitch.

770
02:25:36,309 --> 02:25:58,569
This is what everybody does when they play. Let kids do this. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

771
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:17,850
Oh, get it. Come here you son of a bitch. I'm not a psycho. This is a video. This is...

772
02:26:43,819 --> 02:27:06,520
What's wrong? What? What? What? What? What's wrong with that? What the hell is going on?

773
02:27:11,579 --> 02:27:43,270
This guy has love. Everybody, everybody that plays Blade and Sorcery, every single person,

774
02:27:44,389 --> 02:27:49,909
you try to like cut people's fucking heads off and like stab them in the eye and shit,

775
02:27:49,909 --> 02:27:56,229
and like throw them off cliffs, as everybody does. You tell me you didn't do that? You didn't like

776
02:27:56,229 --> 02:28:00,629
throw a person into another person and then like stab them both through the chest with a

777
02:28:00,870 --> 02:28:09,819
spear and then throw the skewered people off a cliff. But you're lying if you say no.

778
02:28:09,819 --> 02:28:22,139
Oh, that was fucking crazy. This one's called... I feel like we have we seen this one? It's called

779
02:28:22,139 --> 02:28:52,620
Jerma Maze. Have we seen this? Good thing I had it turned down. That's it. All right, that's

780
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:59,850
scary. I wouldn't want to play this game. This is Jerma Makes a TikTok.

781
02:29:00,809 --> 02:29:07,579
God damn, man. Freddie, Freddie Dredd. Freddie just gave $400 of bits.

782
02:29:19,770 --> 02:29:25,620
I don't, I don't, I don't know what that is. It's TikTok. I don't even know what TikTok is.

783
02:29:26,739 --> 02:29:50,200
I mean, I'm lying, but it's, it's a, it's a clock app. No, I know, I know. I've done it before.

784
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:56,620
I don't even, did I even do it again? This, this thing, this thing. Should I do that again?

785
02:29:56,780 --> 02:30:04,629
No, it's been recorded more than once. So like head move. Animated movement thing. Yeah. I,

786
02:30:04,629 --> 02:30:16,379
it's, it's recorded somewhere. I won't do it again. This next one is called, uh, Jerma is Speed.

787
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:36,680
Jerma is Speed. Speed. Speed. You see, on this channel, I like to call myself Dr. Jekyll

788
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:42,120
and Mr. Jerma because I have two different sides. No, no, no. I have a very professional side where

789
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:51,559
I review content. I review packages. What? I don't review packages. You want to fight? You

790
02:30:51,559 --> 02:31:01,319
want to fight? Don't fuck with that. So here's like, here's a cup. This cup is good. There's a whole

791
02:31:01,319 --> 02:31:07,719
lot of stuff here though. I have my fun. I have my professional side. I mold them together into

792
02:31:07,719 --> 02:31:13,479
sort of this lunacy that is Jerma985. So hopefully this little trailer will be able to give you an

793
02:31:13,479 --> 02:31:18,040
explanation of Mr. Jerma and hopefully you subscribe. What? You have to use this. So please

794
02:31:18,040 --> 02:31:28,520
subscribe, subscribe. Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.

795
02:31:45,739 --> 02:32:37,079
Oh, Honda Civic. Wait, what?

796
02:32:39,139 --> 02:32:56,520
This didn't happen. I'm still in like 40th place. You understand?

797
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:58,100
Oh, pass him. Pass him.

798
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:22,340
This is just like the first, this is like the first 20 minutes of the movie.

799
02:34:22,979 --> 02:34:25,379
But the last thing he expected was the full movie.

800
02:34:27,299 --> 02:34:32,579
You know, I don't think anybody expected this. The rookie sensation came into the season unknown,

801
02:34:32,579 --> 02:34:36,899
but everyone knows him now. Will he be the first rookie to win a Piston Cup

802
02:34:36,899 --> 02:34:43,219
and land down a co? The legend, the runner up and the rookie. Three cars, one champion.

803
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:50,379
The

804
02:34:50,379 --> 02:35:25,459
rookie screamer. The full movie. What? Hey, that's just, he just like ripped the band-aid off.

805
02:35:26,969 --> 02:35:37,540
You just tore the band-aid off. I want to know what happens. Should I just watch the movie?

806
02:35:38,579 --> 02:36:08,569
Okay, this one's called Jerma985 reunites with Tim CJ Davidson. Turn it up. Turn it up.

807
02:36:10,809 --> 02:36:18,649
Hey, big smoke. It's me, Carl. Chill, chill. Tim? Tim Davidson? What? Hey, man.

808
02:36:20,409 --> 02:36:33,239
This is my house. Nah, man. It's my mom's, homie. Hey, mad dog. What you doing up there, fool?

809
02:36:34,739 --> 02:36:44,200
Earth. Earth. Earth is on fire. I just shit my pants. I can't do it anymore. Motherfucker.

810
02:36:44,200 --> 02:37:01,159
Get a grip. You still got it? You still gangsta? Some of these just end with just the most

811
02:37:01,159 --> 02:37:20,229
abrupt fucking endings possible. This one's called Jerma Interacting with Chat, and this is going to

812
02:37:20,229 --> 02:37:30,059
be really, really fucking weird. This is another one of those scary deep fakes. Here we go.

813
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:50,420
I'm standing here. You make the move. You make the move.

814
02:37:51,219 --> 02:38:14,860
It's your move. I'm trying. You talking to me? You talking to me? You talking to me? Oh, it's

815
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:22,629
fucked up. Who the hell else are you talking to? You talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here.

816
02:38:22,629 --> 02:38:32,790
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Oh, yeah? Okay.

817
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:48,309
Okay. It's just scary. It's just, you know, the worst thing about deep fakes

818
02:38:49,510 --> 02:38:55,430
is if, if you sent this to, if you sent this to my grandmother,

819
02:38:58,139 --> 02:39:04,809
she would think this was me standing here doing this. You'd be like, what is this? Why, why, why?

820
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:12,090
Why does he, why does he have a gun? That's not the grandson that I raised.

821
02:39:12,809 --> 02:39:18,260
I don't think this is real. My grandmother would think this is real. That's where we're going.

822
02:39:18,260 --> 02:39:29,420
Send it to your grandmother. What in the name of God would I send that to my grandmother for?

823
02:39:30,299 --> 02:39:53,530
His mom's called, uh, Jerma is the newest Avenger. Half-life.

824
02:40:27,350 --> 02:40:31,030
Quickest to a salad you ever made. Here we go. Slap it a couple of times. One, two, three.

825
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:36,309
Easy as pie. Just a thing, the thing to clean it. It opens up like a waterfall.

826
02:40:36,309 --> 02:40:41,190
See? Take a look at that. See? It's easy. No, no, no mess. No bullshit. Throw it in the

827
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:49,639
fucking sink behind me. What? Slap it a couple of times. One, two, three.

828
02:40:49,639 --> 02:40:53,879
What? What? Why? What was the point of that? Two, three.

829
02:40:53,879 --> 02:41:01,370
Got to use the clip somehow. Oh, right. Yeah. I did. Did I, did I do this in front of the green

830
02:41:01,450 --> 02:41:23,260
screen? I don't remember even saying that. I did. Uh, this is called a compact turnabout.

831
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:28,620
This is an Ace Attorney thing. This is not the same one we saw last time, right? Let's see.

832
02:41:56,440 --> 02:41:57,799
A box or something. Yeah.

833
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:04,500
That's very short. He was even having trouble climbing to the box.

834
02:42:05,459 --> 02:42:18,760
Hey, it's me, Jerma, from the downtown of Center Sports. I'm downtown. I'm a Tuber.

835
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:21,639
Sitting down.

836
02:42:27,639 --> 02:42:35,620
What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean? What's that mean?

837
02:42:36,420 --> 02:42:37,139
What's that mean?

838
02:42:37,139 --> 02:43:22,409
I'm an influencer, not a Tuber. That's not all. It also says I, uh, performed at this conundrum.

839
02:43:30,139 --> 02:43:39,909
Why is it a fucking Egypt? What? No, no, no, no. I like Egypt. Please, please.

840
02:43:41,270 --> 02:43:43,909
That's a double. That's a double bullshit.

841
02:43:46,870 --> 02:43:52,629
Nice. There's infinite options, huh? You can do whatever you want in this movie maker.

842
02:43:53,340 --> 02:44:04,379
Yeah. That was, that was a double end the, end the video bullshit. I can't believe it. We,

843
02:44:04,379 --> 02:44:09,430
we got the trick to you, flog pyro, and then explosion. And then you got Vinny at the end.

844
02:44:13,850 --> 02:44:21,500
That was fucking crazy. It was a triple bullshit. You can do anything. React to his reaction.

845
02:44:22,059 --> 02:44:34,469
Is that good? No. Oh, let's get it again. Nice. There's infinite options, huh? You can do

846
02:44:34,469 --> 02:44:50,379
whatever you want in this movie maker. Right. Cool. I made a cover of a giant enemy spider

847
02:44:50,379 --> 02:44:56,819
in a low effort pixel animation. React harder. I don't fucking know how to react. You guys,

848
02:44:56,819 --> 02:44:59,299
don't you guys know that by now? I don't fucking know how to react to anything.

849
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:07,979
My reactions on these streams are this. Or I lean forward and laugh really hard. Or I go

850
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:22,760
react, react, react. I'm doing it again. All right. You said you were fast. I did say I was fast.

851
02:45:36,569 --> 02:46:02,739
Okay. I can't do that again. Okay. I got like full of fucking muscle.

852
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:15,559
Holy fuck. Yeah. So you want to talk about how you don't, you don't think, you don't think I have

853
02:46:15,559 --> 02:46:23,909
the fucking speed. Physical therapy down the drain. No, I did like a burst. That wasn't a turn.

854
02:46:23,909 --> 02:46:30,600
I'm all right. I'm fine. Don't worry. Is this called, let's go to German. Let's just do a solid bop.

855
02:46:45,719 --> 02:46:53,219
No, don't turn it off. It's a great song. Don't turn it off. It's a great song.

856
02:46:53,780 --> 02:46:59,819
Oh shit. I was supposed to do that. A lot of people that are just trickling into this stream,

857
02:46:59,819 --> 02:47:04,379
but I had just probably like, this is like, what is it? This is, it's an explanation I can't give

858
02:47:04,379 --> 02:47:14,229
you. This is, uh, I think we've seen this one before, but this is germ of friends.

859
02:47:30,459 --> 02:47:45,799
Why is this auto playing? This one's called small enemy spider. It looks like an animation.

860
02:47:45,959 --> 02:47:51,450
Wait a minute. Holy shit. There's a small enemy spider.

861
02:48:03,780 --> 02:48:30,979
I just die. That's videos. I just die.

862
02:48:34,059 --> 02:48:35,690
Shit. Hold on.

863
02:48:57,399 --> 02:49:13,899
This one's called Jerma's nightmare. Skipped a video. What are you talking about?

864
02:49:13,979 --> 02:49:35,670
What are you talking about? When he skipped a video, he skipped a pixel. What? Are you sure?

865
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:53,690
Where? Pixel. When, when, when did I skip it? Three videos ago? Wait, what?

866
02:49:54,649 --> 02:50:06,940
You were showing us your speed. Oh, and I just, we just didn't watch the video. Oh, okay. Wait.

867
02:50:06,940 --> 02:50:11,979
I, so I just like skipped it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Sorry. I'm trying to pick.

868
02:50:11,979 --> 02:50:18,840
All right. Somebody link it right now. I thought you meant like I hit like the,

869
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:31,049
all right. I see what you're saying. I was too fast. Let me see this. Oh, okay. Right.

870
02:50:31,049 --> 02:50:38,149
I'm sitting here going like, what are they talking about? My brain is so fucking small. Here we go.

871
02:50:57,799 --> 02:51:00,200
What is this up here? That's not a spider, is it?

872
02:51:00,200 --> 02:51:24,760
It is a spider. That's scary, dude. Dude. Fuck, dude. Dude. Oh, there you go. Sorry that I almost

873
02:51:24,760 --> 02:51:32,659
fucking just did, just deleted it for my brain. That's how you can tell that I have an actual

874
02:51:32,659 --> 02:51:41,700
goldfish memory. This is Jerma's nightmare. I had a dream last night that I was sponsored by this

875
02:51:41,700 --> 02:51:46,579
company that makes this wallet. And I was nervously doing a presentation for it. And there

876
02:51:46,579 --> 02:51:53,059
were like 30,000 people here for some reason. And it was just a wall, a spam of like, I'm

877
02:51:53,059 --> 02:52:09,780
fucking out of here. I'm something you piece of shit. This opens store cards. It's a good wallet.

878
02:52:09,780 --> 02:52:13,700
It is. And it looks like an SSD. There's all kinds of styles.

879
02:52:23,940 --> 02:52:30,260
Really good. They're very good. They're secure. They fit into pants. You can actually put this

880
02:52:30,260 --> 02:52:36,180
into like a jacket pocket. You put your essentials in here. It's light. It's got a nice click to it.

881
02:52:36,979 --> 02:52:40,340
It's very sturdy. What is happening?

882
02:53:22,309 --> 02:53:24,149
What the fuck is going on?

883
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:54,170
Who put that in there?

884
02:53:54,170 --> 02:54:05,430
This is a crack video.

885
02:54:05,430 --> 02:54:07,430
I'm gonna do it with two hands.

886
02:54:07,430 --> 02:54:09,430
Everyone dies.

887
02:54:39,850 --> 02:54:41,850
It's time for you to pay.

888
02:54:43,850 --> 02:54:55,620
Is this a Jojo thing? Jojo?

889
02:54:56,260 --> 02:54:58,569
Something that I care about. Something that I want to show.

890
02:54:58,569 --> 02:55:01,260
That I haven't had the opportunity to do it until now.

891
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:06,760
That's me on my fishing trip.

892
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:08,760
Go through. Get out of here.

893
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:13,030
I'll see you Sunday.

894
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:23,020
Hey!

895
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:25,639
Jesus.

896
02:55:25,639 --> 02:55:36,579
Meme vomit.

897
02:55:36,579 --> 02:55:38,950
It's like this is another full minute.

898
02:55:38,950 --> 02:55:40,950
Are you kidding me? That isn't what happened.

899
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:43,129
That is not what happened. That's exactly what happened.

900
02:55:43,129 --> 02:55:45,129
What are you talking about? No it's not.

901
02:55:45,129 --> 02:55:47,129
That was bullshit. This is what really happened.

902
02:55:47,770 --> 02:55:56,469
Jojo.

903
02:55:56,469 --> 02:56:00,889
What am I about? Wait.

904
02:56:00,889 --> 02:56:02,889
When did I say this?

905
02:56:02,889 --> 02:56:05,899
Alright. Spoilers for Jojo.

906
02:56:05,899 --> 02:56:07,899
I mean we only got 20 seconds left, guy.

907
02:56:07,899 --> 02:56:11,219
Alright. Spoilers for Jojo.

908
02:56:11,219 --> 02:56:13,219
I said. At some point.

909
02:56:13,219 --> 02:56:15,219
If you haven't seen it yet.

910
02:56:15,219 --> 02:56:17,219
If you have.

911
02:56:17,219 --> 02:56:19,219
Jojo.

912
02:56:19,219 --> 02:56:21,219
Jojo.

913
02:56:21,219 --> 02:56:23,219
Not one of you has not seen it.

914
02:56:23,219 --> 02:56:25,219
But mute for the next 45 minutes.

915
02:56:25,860 --> 02:56:27,860
What about me?

916
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:29,860
What about me? I haven't seen it.

917
02:56:29,860 --> 02:56:31,860
What about me?

918
02:56:31,860 --> 02:56:46,180
Should I mute?

919
02:56:46,180 --> 02:56:49,260
Alright. I'm going to look away.

920
02:56:49,260 --> 02:56:51,260
Those of you that have seen the show. You can keep watching.

921
02:56:51,260 --> 02:56:53,260
Those of you that haven't seen the show.

922
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:55,260
Look away. And take out your earphones.

923
02:56:55,260 --> 02:56:57,260
Ok. 3. 2. 1.

924
02:56:57,260 --> 02:57:38,149
Go.

925
02:57:38,149 --> 02:57:41,350
Alright.

926
02:57:41,350 --> 02:57:43,350
We have this one.

927
02:57:43,350 --> 02:57:45,350
This is another animated show.

928
02:57:45,350 --> 02:57:47,350
If you haven't seen.

929
02:57:47,989 --> 02:57:49,989
This is from Attack on Titan.

930
02:57:49,989 --> 02:57:51,989
This is 30 seconds.

931
02:57:51,989 --> 02:57:53,989
This is called German invades castle.

932
02:57:53,989 --> 02:57:56,680
Just want to make sure.

933
02:57:56,680 --> 02:57:58,680
If you have never seen it.

934
02:57:58,680 --> 02:58:00,680
Just the words that I just said 5 seconds ago.

935
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:05,030
If you have never seen it. Who cares.

936
02:58:05,030 --> 02:58:09,450
Here we go.

937
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:11,690
I deleted everything.

938
02:58:11,690 --> 02:58:13,690
This is kind of it.

939
02:58:13,690 --> 02:58:15,690
I just hit the backwards button.

940
02:58:15,690 --> 02:58:17,690
With everything selected.

941
02:58:17,690 --> 02:58:22,100
Sorry.

942
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:24,100
I don't want you to see my pores.

943
02:58:24,739 --> 02:58:26,739
I know. I know.

944
02:58:26,739 --> 02:58:28,739
Screen camera is going to shit.

945
02:58:37,510 --> 02:58:39,510
This one was funny.

946
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:41,510
They've all been good.

947
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:55,399
This one was funny.

948
02:58:55,399 --> 02:58:57,700
Coming up next.

949
02:58:57,700 --> 02:58:59,700
We have a video called.

950
02:58:59,700 --> 02:59:01,700
The impressive scale of our universe.

951
02:59:05,909 --> 02:59:08,729
Let's see what our universe looks like.

952
02:59:08,729 --> 02:59:15,579
I bet you anything.

953
02:59:15,579 --> 02:59:17,579
I'm as small as the smallest atom.

954
02:59:19,819 --> 02:59:21,819
I already know what it is.

955
02:59:21,819 --> 02:59:23,819
I already see it. I've already seen this video.

956
02:59:23,819 --> 02:59:29,190
I guarantee you that's what happens.

957
02:59:29,190 --> 02:59:31,190
There's no way.

958
02:59:31,190 --> 02:59:33,190
That we don't go into like.

959
02:59:33,190 --> 02:59:35,190
0.00500th of a percent of a micron.

960
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:37,190
And not be standing there T posing.

961
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:56,629
Right? Has to be.

962
02:59:56,629 --> 02:59:58,629
Wait for it. Yeah.

963
02:59:58,629 --> 03:00:00,629
We're going to go through the whole thing.

964
03:00:00,629 --> 03:00:02,629
This is how big everything fucking is.

965
03:00:02,629 --> 03:00:28,620
Let's zoom way in.

966
03:00:28,620 --> 03:00:30,620
Pay attention.

967
03:00:30,620 --> 03:00:32,620
I know how the video ends.

968
03:00:33,260 --> 03:01:33,780
Anticipation is killing me.

969
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:45,690
Almost there.

970
03:01:45,690 --> 03:01:52,409
And T pose. Got it.

971
03:01:52,409 --> 03:01:54,409
I'm tiny.

972
03:01:54,409 --> 03:02:08,940
I'm fucking tiny.

973
03:02:08,940 --> 03:02:10,940
I can smell that one from a fucking mile away.

974
03:02:10,940 --> 03:02:16,819
You have appeased us goblin.

975
03:02:16,819 --> 03:02:18,819
Thank you.

976
03:02:18,819 --> 03:02:20,819
How long is that video? 2 minutes and 47 seconds.

977
03:02:20,819 --> 03:02:24,329
Alright coming up next.

978
03:02:24,329 --> 03:02:26,950
We are going to move on to music.

979
03:02:26,950 --> 03:02:31,690
I'm going to hang out for a little bit.

980
03:02:31,690 --> 03:02:36,809
Let's go to conclude the video section.

981
03:02:36,809 --> 03:02:41,030
We had to fucking end on that one.

982
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:45,700
And now we get to do.

983
03:02:45,700 --> 03:02:49,860
Something that I'm not looking forward to.

984
03:02:49,860 --> 03:02:59,270
What's going to happen for the next few.

985
03:02:59,270 --> 03:03:01,270
I want to do music first.

986
03:03:01,270 --> 03:03:07,420
Because I'm about to do.

987
03:03:07,420 --> 03:03:09,420
I'm about to turn on the winks.

988
03:03:09,420 --> 03:03:11,420
They're going to be discounted.

989
03:03:11,420 --> 03:03:13,420
I think it's going to be like.

990
03:03:13,420 --> 03:03:15,420
10,000 or 20.

991
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,420
No. No. No. 20,000. 20,000.

992
03:03:17,420 --> 03:03:19,420
20,000. 10,000.

993
03:03:19,420 --> 03:03:25,690
Alright 10,000 for a wink.

994
03:03:25,690 --> 03:03:27,690
We're going to listen to music.

995
03:03:27,690 --> 03:03:29,690
And just fucking wink into the.

996
03:03:30,329 --> 03:03:41,020
Embarrassing pain in the ass isn't it?

997
03:03:41,020 --> 03:03:43,510
Okay. Hold on.

998
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:49,190
Hold on.

999
03:03:49,190 --> 03:03:51,190
I am about to turn it on.

1000
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:55,739
Don't use it yet.

1001
03:03:55,739 --> 03:04:11,530
I need to be able to keep track of this shit.

1002
03:04:11,530 --> 03:04:13,530
Alright. I'm going to listen to some music.

1003
03:04:13,530 --> 03:04:15,530
And just hang out.

1004
03:04:15,530 --> 03:04:18,860
And fuck this. A bunch of people here.

1005
03:04:18,860 --> 03:04:21,860
And these people are going to be like.

1006
03:04:21,860 --> 03:04:23,860
There's a lot of people here right now.

1007
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:39,290
And I'm going to do this now?

1008
03:04:39,290 --> 03:05:05,719
Wait. Holy shit.

1009
03:05:05,719 --> 03:05:09,940
Should have made it 50.

1010
03:05:10,819 --> 03:05:13,059
Should have made it 50.

1011
03:05:13,059 --> 03:06:00,979
I turned it off.

1012
03:06:00,979 --> 03:06:04,440
I think there are.

1013
03:06:04,440 --> 03:06:08,709
Let's see.

1014
03:06:08,709 --> 03:06:10,709
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

1015
03:06:10,709 --> 03:06:12,709
10, 11, 12, 13,

1016
03:06:12,709 --> 03:06:14,709
14.

1017
03:06:14,709 --> 03:06:17,719
Are there any.

1018
03:06:17,719 --> 03:06:19,719
Mods.

1019
03:06:19,719 --> 03:06:21,959
That are in the channel right now.

1020
03:06:21,959 --> 03:06:23,959
That.

1021
03:06:23,959 --> 03:06:25,959
Anybody have any.

1022
03:06:27,959 --> 03:06:30,139
Data on how many that just was.

1023
03:06:30,780 --> 03:06:35,450
That was a lot.

1024
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:46,069
It was probably

1025
03:06:46,069 --> 03:06:48,069
2 or 3. It was like 3 or 400.

1026
03:06:48,069 --> 03:06:51,079
It was 400.

1027
03:06:51,079 --> 03:06:53,079
Grump.

1028
03:06:53,079 --> 03:06:55,079
If you have any awareness or access

1029
03:06:55,079 --> 03:06:57,079
to how many times somebody just redeemed a link.

1030
03:06:57,079 --> 03:06:59,079
It was like

1031
03:06:59,079 --> 03:07:01,079
hundreds and hundreds of fucking times.

1032
03:07:01,079 --> 03:07:05,180
I think it was like 400 and something.

1033
03:07:05,180 --> 03:07:07,180
543.

1034
03:07:07,180 --> 03:07:09,180
543 times.

1035
03:07:09,180 --> 03:07:21,079
Okay.

1036
03:07:21,079 --> 03:07:35,350
I need like a counter.

1037
03:07:38,219 --> 03:07:40,219
I'm like practicing.

1038
03:07:40,219 --> 03:07:43,799
I'm like going to prepare for this.

1039
03:07:43,799 --> 03:07:55,620
Okay.

1040
03:07:55,620 --> 03:07:57,620
One blink counts as 2?

1041
03:07:57,620 --> 03:07:59,620
No, no, no, no. Does it? Yeah, it does.

1042
03:07:59,620 --> 03:08:07,750
No? What do you mean no?

1043
03:08:07,750 --> 03:08:09,750
Oh my fucking god. I can't believe that.

1044
03:08:09,750 --> 03:08:11,750
Am I? I'm not like the. I'm not like the top

1045
03:08:11,750 --> 03:08:13,750
row of just chatting right now.

1046
03:08:13,750 --> 03:08:18,170
And I'm going to wink count?

1047
03:08:18,170 --> 03:08:20,170
Hey, come on out of German. I hit 5.

1048
03:08:20,170 --> 03:08:22,170
Where I go like this. Click. Click.

1049
03:08:22,170 --> 03:08:25,049
543 fucking times.

1050
03:08:25,049 --> 03:08:28,120
Oh, I did this to myself.

1051
03:08:28,760 --> 03:08:34,969
I did this to myself.

1052
03:08:34,969 --> 03:08:47,500
Hold on. Hold on. Give us the winks.

1053
03:08:47,500 --> 03:08:49,500
Alright. Hold on. Wait. Wait. I gotta move.

1054
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:55,829
I have to move something.

1055
03:08:55,829 --> 03:08:58,579
Because we still have music to do.

1056
03:08:58,579 --> 03:09:01,139
I still want to play the music.

1057
03:09:01,139 --> 03:09:03,319
I'm getting this over with right now.

1058
03:09:03,319 --> 03:09:22,389
And winks are dead forever. They're not coming back.

1059
03:09:22,389 --> 03:09:52,790
Oh man. Oh man. Oh man.

1060
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:55,670
The music?

1061
03:09:55,670 --> 03:09:57,670
I'm almost halfway there. I'm fine.

1062
03:09:57,670 --> 03:09:59,670
What do you mean music? Oh, you want fucking music?

1063
03:09:59,670 --> 03:10:01,670
Fine. We'll play some fucking music.

1064
03:10:01,670 --> 03:10:38,260
Okay. I missed one.

1065
03:10:38,260 --> 03:10:51,049
What was that? Put on thunderstruck?

1066
03:10:51,049 --> 03:10:56,809
Was it like just a kid talking?

1067
03:10:56,809 --> 03:11:01,860
No. No. We're not at 21.

1068
03:11:01,860 --> 03:11:03,860
We're at 63.

1069
03:11:03,860 --> 03:11:05,860
You have to catch up.

1070
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:07,860
Click on source.

1071
03:11:07,860 --> 03:11:09,860
You're watching in like 360p. You're like 4 minutes behind.

1072
03:11:19,700 --> 03:11:21,700
I'll make this go so much faster.

1073
03:11:21,700 --> 03:12:27,559
If I do this.

1074
03:12:27,559 --> 03:12:29,559
There's an intro before the intro.

1075
03:12:29,559 --> 03:12:31,559
I just want sound effects.

1076
03:12:31,559 --> 03:13:37,260
I'm close.

1077
03:13:37,260 --> 03:13:39,260
He's going crazy.

1078
03:13:39,260 --> 03:13:41,559
This is performance art?

1079
03:13:41,559 --> 03:13:45,590
No. This is called making a mistake.

1080
03:13:45,590 --> 03:13:47,590
This is called making a mistake.

1081
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:49,590
Minus 400 viewers.

1082
03:13:49,590 --> 03:14:41,110
Oh fuck.

1083
03:14:41,110 --> 03:14:43,110
It's replaying them.

1084
03:14:43,110 --> 03:15:03,780
We need a better playlist.

1085
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:08,709
Do thunderstruck?

1086
03:15:08,709 --> 03:15:11,459
Hey lady.

1087
03:15:11,459 --> 03:15:14,200
Nope. We're staying here.

1088
03:15:14,200 --> 03:15:18,020
Oh babe. I am.

1089
03:15:18,020 --> 03:15:26,139
Yeah baby.

1090
03:15:26,139 --> 03:15:28,139
Okay. We actually are moving on.

1091
03:15:28,139 --> 03:15:36,780
I'll get this all done in one

1092
03:15:36,780 --> 03:15:38,780
thunderstruck.

1093
03:15:38,780 --> 03:15:40,780
I'll get this done in one thunderstruck.

1094
03:15:40,780 --> 03:15:44,420
543?

1095
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:51,850
Can you put water in your eyes?

1096
03:15:51,850 --> 03:15:53,850
Like can I like put water in my eyes

1097
03:15:53,850 --> 03:15:55,850
to like lubricate them?

1098
03:15:55,850 --> 03:16:01,860
That's okay right?

1099
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:03,860
Okay. Don't do that.

1100
03:16:03,860 --> 03:16:08,020
At least let me lubricate something.

1101
03:16:08,020 --> 03:17:02,729
I gotta get ready for this.

1102
03:17:02,729 --> 03:17:04,729
Hold on.

1103
03:17:04,729 --> 03:17:06,729
These bleeding viewers.

1104
03:17:06,729 --> 03:17:08,729
Do you think people are going to want to stay?

1105
03:17:08,729 --> 03:18:28,459
TikTok!

1106
03:18:28,459 --> 03:18:39,399
What do you mean they don't count?

1107
03:18:39,399 --> 03:18:42,389
I'm getting sleepy.

1108
03:18:42,389 --> 03:18:44,389
Okay. It's itchy.

1109
03:18:44,389 --> 03:18:46,569
It's itchy right now.

1110
03:18:46,569 --> 03:18:48,569
My eyes are wicked itchy.

1111
03:18:48,569 --> 03:18:51,579
They're bleeding?

1112
03:18:51,579 --> 03:18:58,549
I'm not bleeding.

1113
03:18:58,549 --> 03:19:01,110
No. It's just itchy.

1114
03:19:01,110 --> 03:19:03,110
It's wicked itchy. Oh no. I know why.

1115
03:19:03,110 --> 03:19:05,110
Because I touched this.

1116
03:19:05,110 --> 03:19:07,479
I'm fine.

1117
03:19:07,479 --> 03:19:09,479
I'm getting an irritated eye from winking.

1118
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:15,260
Imagine winking yourself into an allergy.

1119
03:19:15,260 --> 03:19:17,430
Holy shit man.

1120
03:19:17,430 --> 03:19:19,610
What the?

1121
03:19:19,610 --> 03:19:42,899
Alright when you do this like

1122
03:19:42,899 --> 03:19:44,899
400 fucking times.

1123
03:19:44,899 --> 03:19:46,899
It starts to blend together.

1124
03:19:46,899 --> 03:19:48,899
It starts to blend together like

1125
03:19:48,899 --> 03:19:50,899
an itchy eye. Hold on.

1126
03:19:50,899 --> 03:19:54,809
This is fucked up.

1127
03:19:54,809 --> 03:19:58,459
Hey.

1128
03:19:58,459 --> 03:20:00,819
Is it fucked up that I'm doing it?

1129
03:20:00,819 --> 03:20:03,639
Fucked up that you're here watching it.

1130
03:20:03,639 --> 03:20:05,879
Which one?

1131
03:20:05,879 --> 03:20:17,209
I gotta help myself here. Ready?

1132
03:20:17,209 --> 03:20:27,510
It's becoming hard to do.

1133
03:20:27,510 --> 03:20:34,680
I'm gonna end up with like

1134
03:20:34,680 --> 03:20:36,680
big eyebrow muscles.

1135
03:20:36,680 --> 03:20:38,680
I'm gonna have huge ass eyebrow

1136
03:20:38,680 --> 03:20:40,680
with like cheek muscles from this.

1137
03:20:40,680 --> 03:20:42,680
I'm like working out muscles up here

1138
03:20:42,680 --> 03:20:44,680
that I've never worked out in my life.

1139
03:20:44,680 --> 03:20:46,979
I'm gonna get like big

1140
03:20:46,979 --> 03:21:13,159
jacked under eyes.

1141
03:21:13,159 --> 03:21:15,159
This guy's an egomaniac.

1142
03:21:15,159 --> 03:21:19,700
No he's just an idiot.

1143
03:21:19,700 --> 03:21:22,389
That continues to fuck up stuff.

1144
03:21:22,389 --> 03:21:26,680
Super Saiyan 3.

1145
03:21:26,680 --> 03:21:32,059
Both?

1146
03:21:32,059 --> 03:21:35,059
He's normally just dumb.

1147
03:21:35,059 --> 03:21:42,229
We're almost there.

1148
03:21:42,229 --> 03:22:19,670
Play us out.

1149
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:21,670
500. What was it?

1150
03:22:21,670 --> 03:22:23,670
Oh it was 543. Fuck.

1151
03:22:23,670 --> 03:23:08,790
555.

1152
03:23:08,790 --> 03:23:10,790
I did extra because some of those were blinks.

1153
03:23:10,790 --> 03:23:13,030
Alright now excuse me.

1154
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:15,030
I'm going to go throw up.

1155
03:23:15,030 --> 03:23:29,989
I did it. Ding ding ding.

1156
03:23:29,989 --> 03:23:31,989
I won.

1157
03:23:31,989 --> 03:23:33,989
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

1158
03:23:33,989 --> 03:23:37,190
Winks by the way are gone.

1159
03:23:37,190 --> 03:23:45,639
They're not coming back.

1160
03:23:45,639 --> 03:23:47,639
Anyways we have some music to listen to.

1161
03:23:47,639 --> 03:23:51,670
I'm gonna be watching everybody.

1162
03:23:51,670 --> 03:23:56,540
I'm gonna come back to camera now.

1163
03:23:56,540 --> 03:24:00,059
We're just gonna chill and listen to some music.

1164
03:24:00,059 --> 03:24:03,829
While we do the bits.

1165
03:24:03,829 --> 03:24:05,829
That sounds like a good place to put it.

1166
03:24:05,829 --> 03:24:08,649
I'm gonna replace it with something more fun.

1167
03:24:08,649 --> 03:24:10,649
I'm replacing it with stuff like what we did yesterday.

1168
03:24:10,649 --> 03:24:12,889
If you were here yesterday

1169
03:24:12,889 --> 03:24:14,889
that is more

1170
03:24:14,889 --> 03:24:16,889
fun to me.

1171
03:24:16,889 --> 03:24:18,889
Than just dump like

1172
03:24:18,889 --> 03:24:20,889
20-30 thousand points

1173
03:24:20,889 --> 03:24:22,889
and like streamers said something.

1174
03:24:22,889 --> 03:24:25,260
Or winks into camera.

1175
03:24:25,260 --> 03:24:27,260
I actually have like little fun games.

1176
03:24:27,260 --> 03:24:32,760
You know what I mean?

1177
03:24:32,760 --> 03:24:36,969
The idea.

1178
03:24:36,969 --> 03:24:41,319
We're gonna do the, how many points for

1179
03:24:41,319 --> 03:24:46,379
Nancy Drew stream.

1180
03:24:46,379 --> 03:24:48,379
Please play Joel's movie in time.

1181
03:24:48,379 --> 03:24:50,620
Have you watched the 3D movie maker movie?

1182
03:24:50,620 --> 03:24:56,180
Oh I haven't no.

1183
03:24:56,180 --> 03:24:58,180
Alright well that's the last thing that we're gonna do.

1184
03:24:58,180 --> 03:25:01,059
We're gonna end the stream

1185
03:25:01,059 --> 03:25:03,059
with Joel's 3D movie maker movie.

1186
03:25:03,059 --> 03:25:12,020
But not now. Not yet.

1187
03:25:12,020 --> 03:25:17,020
Let's listen to some music first.

1188
03:25:17,020 --> 03:25:19,020
While we do the bits and stuff.

1189
03:25:19,020 --> 03:25:21,020
Actually no we should probably hold off.

1190
03:25:21,020 --> 03:25:23,020
Because it's gonna be like another 20-30 minutes right?

1191
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:26,280
Yeah let's hold off.

1192
03:25:26,280 --> 03:25:31,510
Let's play some music.

1193
03:25:31,510 --> 03:25:33,510
This is some giant enemy spider music.

1194
03:25:33,510 --> 03:25:39,020
That we're gonna listen to right now.

1195
03:25:39,020 --> 03:25:41,020
Here's this first one.

1196
03:25:41,020 --> 03:25:52,389
This actually is pretty sick.

1197
03:25:52,389 --> 03:26:03,909
This is actually pretty good.

1198
03:26:03,909 --> 03:26:05,909
This is actually pretty good.

1199
03:26:05,909 --> 03:26:16,469
Right now Nintendo owns this.

1200
03:26:16,469 --> 03:26:19,610
I think they owned it before too.

1201
03:26:19,610 --> 03:26:42,459
Bopping.

1202
03:26:42,459 --> 03:26:44,459
Look at this. This sounds pretty good.

1203
03:26:44,459 --> 03:27:00,579
That's why I'm ice fine.

1204
03:27:00,579 --> 03:27:11,590
End of the stream.

1205
03:27:11,590 --> 03:27:13,590
Well I mean technically this is the end of the stream.

1206
03:27:13,590 --> 03:27:16,409
We're doing a bonus end.

1207
03:27:16,409 --> 03:27:18,709
We're gonna watch Joel's movie.

1208
03:27:18,709 --> 03:27:27,420
This next one is very very interesting.

1209
03:27:27,420 --> 03:27:29,979
This is called

1210
03:27:29,979 --> 03:27:37,139
Kids With Rats.

1211
03:27:37,139 --> 03:27:39,139
You know that thing how the rat song goes

1212
03:27:39,139 --> 03:27:41,139
literally with everything?

1213
03:27:41,139 --> 03:27:43,139
It's pretty cool actually.

1214
03:27:43,139 --> 03:27:45,139
It's pretty cool actually.

1215
03:27:45,139 --> 03:27:47,639
It's pretty cool actually.

1216
03:27:47,639 --> 03:27:51,659
It's pretty cool actually.

1217
03:27:51,659 --> 03:28:15,139
That's good shit.

1218
03:28:15,139 --> 03:28:18,790
Link, link, link, link, link, link.

1219
03:28:18,790 --> 03:28:21,610
Here's Link.

1220
03:28:21,610 --> 03:28:25,639
There you go. That was really good.

1221
03:28:25,639 --> 03:28:28,899
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda.

1222
03:28:28,899 --> 03:28:30,899
This one's called Giant Enemy Spider 11.

1223
03:28:30,899 --> 03:28:33,719
The giant enemy spider.

1224
03:28:33,719 --> 03:28:35,719
The giant enemy spider.

1225
03:28:35,719 --> 03:28:44,360
Isn't this 11 seconds?

1226
03:28:44,360 --> 03:28:48,139
Hey, giant

1227
03:28:48,139 --> 03:28:50,309
enemy spider.

1228
03:28:50,309 --> 03:28:52,309
Wait, Jerma screams.

1229
03:28:52,309 --> 03:28:56,090
So handsome.

1230
03:28:56,090 --> 03:29:01,590
I'm the most handsome person you've ever met.

1231
03:29:01,590 --> 03:29:03,590
What the fuck is that guy?

1232
03:29:03,590 --> 03:29:06,020
They fucking scream.

1233
03:29:06,020 --> 03:29:08,020
I never

1234
03:29:08,020 --> 03:29:10,020
scream like that.

1235
03:29:14,200 --> 03:29:16,200
I'm a fan of that person.

1236
03:29:16,200 --> 03:29:24,059
God, shut up already.

1237
03:29:24,059 --> 03:29:26,059
What? I just turned it on.

1238
03:29:26,059 --> 03:29:28,059
What are you talking about?

1239
03:29:28,059 --> 03:29:30,620
Oh yeah, somebody did that recently.

1240
03:29:30,620 --> 03:29:32,620
I remember that. I turned the stream on

1241
03:29:32,620 --> 03:29:34,620
and I started talking about, like, they love doing the intro.

1242
03:29:34,620 --> 03:29:36,620
And somebody was like, dude, shut the fuck up already.

1243
03:29:36,620 --> 03:29:38,620
Dude, just shut up already.

1244
03:29:38,620 --> 03:29:40,620
I just turned on the stream.

1245
03:29:40,620 --> 03:29:42,620
I remember that.

1246
03:29:42,620 --> 03:29:45,690
It's like, I just turned on the

1247
03:29:45,690 --> 03:29:47,690
fucking broadcast.

1248
03:29:47,690 --> 03:29:49,690
You're going to be here for at least,

1249
03:29:49,690 --> 03:29:51,690
you're going to have to listen to me for at least four to eight

1250
03:29:51,690 --> 03:29:53,690
hours, depending on how I feel that day.

1251
03:29:53,690 --> 03:29:59,379
This next one's called Giant Enemy Spider

1252
03:29:59,379 --> 03:30:02,010
Remix.

1253
03:30:02,010 --> 03:30:04,010
The giant enemy spider.

1254
03:30:04,010 --> 03:30:06,010
Giant enemy spider

1255
03:30:06,010 --> 03:30:18,299
remix.

1256
03:30:18,299 --> 03:30:47,020
Seriously.

1257
03:30:47,020 --> 03:31:13,110
Link, I actually

1258
03:31:13,110 --> 03:31:15,110
don't have a link for this one because

1259
03:31:15,110 --> 03:31:17,110
it was embedded directly into Discord.

1260
03:31:17,110 --> 03:31:22,090
Let me see

1261
03:31:22,090 --> 03:31:24,090
if I can get it.

1262
03:31:24,090 --> 03:32:22,180
This is good.

1263
03:32:22,180 --> 03:32:35,940
What going on in this one?

1264
03:32:35,940 --> 03:32:52,520
Trying to find it. It's right here somewhere.

1265
03:32:52,520 --> 03:32:58,920
Hold on.

1266
03:33:03,799 --> 03:33:06,420
Oh, with the ending too, with the old

1267
03:33:06,420 --> 03:33:11,799
ending sound.

1268
03:33:11,799 --> 03:33:15,450
Yeah, even with, hold on.

1269
03:33:15,450 --> 03:33:17,450
Even with the, if I found it in Discord,

1270
03:33:17,450 --> 03:33:20,520
you'd have to go to the community

1271
03:33:20,520 --> 03:33:22,520
content section

1272
03:33:22,520 --> 03:33:26,790
and pull it from there.

1273
03:33:26,790 --> 03:33:28,790
Let me get the exact name of it though.

1274
03:33:28,790 --> 03:33:35,700
Somebody, oh, you got it, somebody has it right now?

1275
03:33:35,700 --> 03:33:38,969
You got it? Is that it?

1276
03:33:38,969 --> 03:33:47,100
Oh, they don't. Shit. Okay.

1277
03:33:47,100 --> 03:33:50,489
Yeah, because I had to save this and just

1278
03:33:50,489 --> 03:33:52,489
play it through the computer.

1279
03:33:52,489 --> 03:33:54,489
So, if we can get maybe somebody

1280
03:33:54,489 --> 03:33:56,489
one of the mods or something maybe

1281
03:33:56,489 --> 03:33:58,489
where somebody can find it.

1282
03:33:58,489 --> 03:34:00,790
Because I just tried to scroll through and couldn't see it.

1283
03:34:00,790 --> 03:34:03,350
Oh, there you go. Okay.

1284
03:34:03,350 --> 03:34:05,909
Yeah, it's in the

1285
03:34:05,909 --> 03:34:07,909
stream chat in stream related

1286
03:34:07,909 --> 03:34:11,110
category. Cool. There we go. That was really

1287
03:34:11,110 --> 03:34:18,729
fucking good. Now,

1288
03:34:18,729 --> 03:34:24,420
without further ado,

1289
03:34:24,420 --> 03:34:27,049
we're going to do,

1290
03:34:27,049 --> 03:34:31,319
we're going to watch Joel's

1291
03:34:31,319 --> 03:34:36,229
video.

1292
03:34:36,229 --> 03:34:38,229
Does somebody have a link to the 3D movie maker movie?

1293
03:34:38,229 --> 03:34:45,020
This is it. Link this.

1294
03:34:45,020 --> 03:34:47,319
Hurry. Why

1295
03:34:47,319 --> 03:34:52,120
are you in a hurry?

1296
03:34:52,120 --> 03:34:54,120
The giant enemy spider.

1297
03:34:54,120 --> 03:34:56,120
Spider on me like the Spider-Man.

1298
03:34:56,120 --> 03:34:58,120
This is not it.

1299
03:34:58,120 --> 03:35:00,120
Link this.

1300
03:35:00,120 --> 03:35:02,120
Hurry.

1301
03:35:02,120 --> 03:35:04,120
I do not want the cooties, man.

1302
03:35:04,120 --> 03:35:06,120
Spider on me like the Spider-Man.

1303
03:35:06,120 --> 03:35:08,120
I've been jumping higher than I head up on a single fan.

1304
03:35:08,120 --> 03:35:10,120
Quick, link it.

1305
03:35:10,120 --> 03:35:12,120
I don't want you

1306
03:35:12,120 --> 03:35:14,120
I do not want the cooties, man. I think we've heard

1307
03:35:14,120 --> 03:35:16,360
this already. It's pretty good.

1308
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:20,260
Real link. Yeah,

1309
03:35:20,260 --> 03:35:22,260
we've heard that already.

1310
03:35:22,260 --> 03:35:29,299
You motherfucker.

1311
03:35:29,299 --> 03:35:37,940
Okay, here we go. Let's pull this back.

1312
03:35:37,940 --> 03:35:42,299
We're going to watch this movie.

1313
03:35:42,299 --> 03:35:50,170
I need to get like a snack or something.

1314
03:35:50,170 --> 03:35:52,170
Oh, do I need like a snack for this?

1315
03:35:52,170 --> 03:36:00,739
Just eat your nails.

1316
03:36:00,739 --> 03:36:02,739
Alright, I'll be right back. I'm going to

1317
03:36:02,739 --> 03:36:05,049
get like a water.

1318
03:36:05,049 --> 03:36:07,049
The stream is technically over.

1319
03:36:07,049 --> 03:36:09,219
Alright, technically. Cause we're just

1320
03:36:09,219 --> 03:36:11,219
watching Joel's movie and we're going to scroll through some other stuff

1321
03:36:11,219 --> 03:36:13,219
too. And do the bits and everything.

1322
03:36:13,219 --> 03:36:15,219
So I'll be right back.

1323
03:36:15,219 --> 03:36:17,219
In fact, I'm just going to go to the screen because

1324
03:36:17,219 --> 03:36:19,719
this is more accurate. I'll be right back.

1325
03:36:19,719 --> 03:38:21,190
Okay.

1326
03:38:21,190 --> 03:38:23,940
This is called the Blue

1327
03:38:23,940 --> 03:38:27,020
Shell Incident.

1328
03:38:27,020 --> 03:38:29,020
This is what this is called.

1329
03:38:29,020 --> 03:38:42,899
Hold on, let me get it in the right spot.

1330
03:38:42,899 --> 03:38:54,870
We need a React

1331
03:38:54,870 --> 03:38:57,819
Cam. Oh, you don't need a

1332
03:38:57,819 --> 03:39:07,860
React Cam, do you?

1333
03:39:07,860 --> 03:39:09,860
Alright, hold on. You want a React

1334
03:39:09,860 --> 03:39:13,000
Cam? Let me just fix my hair so

1335
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:15,000
I look at least presentable

1336
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:17,000
on your fucking big screen.

1337
03:39:17,000 --> 03:39:19,000
What's going on in the back of my head here?

1338
03:39:19,000 --> 03:39:30,500
Alright, here we go. This is

1339
03:39:30,500 --> 03:39:32,500
the Blue Shell Incident.

1340
03:39:32,500 --> 03:39:44,540
Just spaghetti on the rocks.

1341
03:39:44,540 --> 03:39:51,129
Don't you get these characters?

1342
03:39:51,129 --> 03:39:53,129
Hey, little bro. Or should I say

1343
03:39:53,129 --> 03:39:55,129
Green Mario?

1344
03:39:55,129 --> 03:40:03,000
Don't you dive in Sansibar?

1345
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:05,819
Ah, but that's where you're wrong, bro.

1346
03:40:05,819 --> 03:40:07,819
You see, Blue Shell Incident

1347
03:40:07,819 --> 03:40:10,250
was just a cover up.

1348
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:17,799
Location,

1349
03:40:17,799 --> 03:40:19,799
Sansibar Island,

1350
03:40:19,799 --> 03:40:21,799
5 PM.

1351
03:40:21,799 --> 03:40:32,409
That was...

1352
03:40:33,409 --> 03:40:36,930
This is Lasagna

1353
03:40:36,930 --> 03:40:38,930
Ocelot, over.

1354
03:40:38,930 --> 03:40:40,930
Commencing Operation Blue

1355
03:40:40,930 --> 03:40:42,930
Shell Kill. How did you get Garfield?

1356
03:40:42,930 --> 03:40:45,229
When did you get a gun?

1357
03:40:45,229 --> 03:40:47,229
And the wood pipe was a Zybrows's ass all

1358
03:40:47,229 --> 03:40:49,229
along, Luigi!

1359
03:40:49,229 --> 03:40:51,229
Hey, uh, do you smell

1360
03:40:51,229 --> 03:40:53,229
Lasagna?

1361
03:40:53,229 --> 03:40:55,229
Hey, Luigi!

1362
03:40:55,229 --> 03:40:57,229
I was talking here!

1363
03:40:57,229 --> 03:41:06,700
What scene is this?

1364
03:41:06,700 --> 03:41:08,700
Well, Luigi, all I gotta say is

1365
03:41:08,700 --> 03:41:10,700
pasta la vista.

1366
03:41:10,700 --> 03:41:13,649
Lasagna doesn't smell Italian.

1367
03:41:13,649 --> 03:41:15,649
All I gotta say, Luigi,

1368
03:41:15,649 --> 03:41:17,649
you go to hell before you die!

1369
03:41:17,649 --> 03:41:21,489
D-d-d-d-d-die?

1370
03:41:21,489 --> 03:41:27,180
I didn't shoot Luigi, we don't kill Luigi,

1371
03:41:27,180 --> 03:41:29,180
do you? Holy fuck.

1372
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:42,049
That's pretty good.

1373
03:41:42,049 --> 03:41:44,350
That was a pretty good Luigi.

1374
03:41:51,440 --> 03:41:54,239
Today just

1375
03:41:54,239 --> 03:41:56,239
had to be a Monday, huh?

1376
03:41:56,239 --> 03:42:00,659
Oh my god.

1377
03:42:00,659 --> 03:42:09,299
Oh no, it was Mario

1378
03:42:09,299 --> 03:42:11,299
that got shot, not Luigi.

1379
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:29,600
Blow up the earth. Blow the earth up. Please blow the

1380
03:42:29,600 --> 03:42:32,350
earth up. I know you want to do it. Do it.

1381
03:42:32,350 --> 03:42:39,120
Do it!

1382
03:42:39,120 --> 03:42:43,090
Oh, god damn it.

1383
03:42:43,090 --> 03:42:48,590
I thought we were gonna get an earth explosion.

1384
03:42:48,590 --> 03:42:50,590
That's right, Luigi! It was me

1385
03:42:50,590 --> 03:42:52,590
all along! It's

1386
03:42:52,590 --> 03:42:54,590
me, Mario!

1387
03:42:54,590 --> 03:42:59,840
Yahoo!

1388
03:42:59,840 --> 03:43:02,209
Mario, that's impossible!

1389
03:43:02,209 --> 03:43:11,229
Well, if I can't

1390
03:43:11,229 --> 03:43:13,229
have had any better aim, you'd be dead

1391
03:43:13,229 --> 03:43:15,229
that Monday. I guess

1392
03:43:15,229 --> 03:43:17,229
you could call a Spaghetti up, Luigi!

1393
03:43:17,229 --> 03:43:19,229
But Mario,

1394
03:43:19,229 --> 03:43:21,229
what about the blood?

1395
03:43:21,229 --> 03:43:23,229

1489
04:04:51,860 --> 04:05:00,750
people need to understand this shit this each minute of this is this program is

1490
04:05:00,750 --> 04:05:09,260
not designed to do any of this shit any absolutely zero so trying to manipulate

1491
04:05:09,260 --> 04:05:15,440
this to do any of this it's so hard to do fuck you Windows 10 from was

1492
04:05:15,440 --> 04:05:34,120
destroying this yeah it is post-credit scene

1493
04:05:34,120 --> 04:05:44,280
what's the success no sir operation blue shell kill was indeed a success no sir

1494
04:05:44,280 --> 04:05:57,149
D for lore no yet that's Garfield

1495
04:06:15,879 --> 04:06:26,530
it is so fun to fuck around in this program I was insane even having that

1496
04:06:26,569 --> 04:06:31,850
many people like that many characters is sitting like in one place is just so

1497
04:06:31,850 --> 04:06:38,129
it's so annoying to manipulate stuff you're not subbed I thought I've logged

1498
04:06:38,129 --> 04:06:46,680
in I haven't been logged into my YouTube channel in fucking like a half decade

1499
04:06:46,680 --> 04:07:12,100
I'm not logged in that was fucking crazy though and I know my password I'm glad

1500
04:07:12,139 --> 04:07:22,649
I finally get to see it we spent was a 26 minute film we just saw and that's

1501
04:07:22,649 --> 04:07:30,930
gonna bring us to the actual the actual find down in the stream log in on the

1502
04:07:30,930 --> 04:07:43,459
stream why the fuck would I do that make rat movie 3 on stream it's is that

1503
04:07:43,459 --> 04:07:51,059
something that people would actually want me to do and watch the thing is it

1504
04:07:51,100 --> 04:07:59,389
3d movie maker is not like 30 movie it's not like the movies it's a lot more

1505
04:07:59,389 --> 04:08:04,389
like painful frame-by-frame animation than it is about like hey look at this

1506
04:08:04,389 --> 04:08:14,360
funny thing that happens right now but I would actually consider that because the

1507
04:08:14,360 --> 04:08:21,209
plan for rat movie 3 kind of just disappeared when I stopped making

1508
04:08:21,209 --> 04:08:29,229
YouTube videos so maybe I put it on the list it would I would have to be truly

1509
04:08:29,430 --> 04:08:34,469
dedicated to it though because I would need to dedicate real real real time to

1510
04:08:34,469 --> 04:08:43,950
it actual time to it so I don't know I don't know what I want to do with that

1511
04:08:43,950 --> 04:09:01,879
there is no list German we know oh yeah there is no list I've got a notepad right

1512
04:09:01,879 --> 04:09:07,840

1513
04:09:07,840 --> 04:09:12,809

1514
04:09:12,809 --> 04:09:17,479

get to see is German love the stream what's your favorite brand of adult

1584
04:18:19,559 --> 04:18:23,639

1585
04:18:23,639 --> 04:18:27,280
knew it was an emote only mode so what you did is you type that sentence out

1586
04:18:27,280 --> 04:18:32,040
sentence out and waited until the second you saw the notification and hit enter

1587

make sure you were the first one smart that's very smart that's like that's a

1589
04:18:51,670 --> 04:18:54,950
to have it be at least something I can do for a few hours though cuz I feel

1590
04:18:54,950 --> 04:18:59,290
like if I went back to Celeste I would hopefully I mean would that be more

1591
04:18:59,290 --> 04:19:03,729
than an hour or two the new levels are harder than Jump King well I know

some someone from MIT the voice replication is actually very good for

1601
04:20:08,299 --> 04:20:12,379
some of the options give it a try you've actually heard of some of these things

1602
04:20:12,379 --> 04:20:18,959
before aren't there aren't there what can't you do

1603
04:20:18,959 --> 04:20:28,000
in this shit that you can do that's like you send in voice clips and it'll give

1604
04:20:28,000 --> 04:20:34,409
it'll give you text-to-speech of your voice and it's perfect that's so scary I

1605
04:20:34,450 --> 04:20:37,530
thought about doing that it might have been fun to do but then it's like holy

1606
04:20:37,530 --> 04:20:45,879
shit now somebody can use that people could make you say anything I just

1607

imagine it in the next community content video people just having that

1608
04:20:48,840 --> 04:20:53,719
software and having it just not even need to sentence splice any fucked up

04:22:21,680 --> 04:22:28,760
well um that actually kind of didn't happen I had like 8,200 concurrent

1622
04:22:28,760 --> 04:22:34,559
viewers and then when I started winking we dropped to about 7,100 so we actually

1623
04:22:34,559 --> 04:22:42,629
lost about a thousand people during that whole thing so it's alright that's

1624

hundred and one domination is thanks for thousand bits ten dollars hey German

1673
04:28:37,930 --> 04:28:40,690
you've been a great help over the past few weeks as schools over here in South

1674
04:28:40,690 --> 04:28:45,809
Korea was shut down due to the corona virus with them opening back up in April

1675
04:28:45,809 --> 04:28:50,409
after spring break has been really frustrating being a senior in high

1676
04:28:50,409 --> 04:28:53,850
school makes things kind of important you've odds in the evening and streams

1677
04:28:53,850 --> 04:28:56,850
in the morning have been great for keeping me morale high in times like

1678
04:28:56,850 --> 04:29:02,010
these it's not as bad as a lot of the media report life isn't quite the same

1679
04:29:02,010 --> 04:29:08,620
hopefully that goes back to normal very soon I can imagine how frustrating that

1680
04:29:08,620 --> 04:29:15,719
is even now over here is new cases every day over here and it gets to a point

1681
04:29:15,719 --> 04:29:19,239
where it's like well all right how when how's this gonna play out you know how

1682
04:29:19,239 --> 04:29:23,680
is gonna happen oh I mean we've already started seeing

1683
04:29:23,719 --> 04:29:30,770
conventions and being closed and stuff canceled things being moved so it's

1684
04:29:30,770 --> 04:29:36,020
starting to happen over here too you just really hope that it doesn't get to

1685
04:29:36,020 --> 04:29:43,510
a point where everything has to shut off for an extended period of time so who

1686
04:29:43,510 --> 04:29:50,440
knows just try to stay safe as you can try to take care of yourself and let's

1687
04:29:50,440 --> 04:29:55,129
hope this whole thing kind of lays itself out with the right with the

1688
04:29:55,129 --> 04:30:01,180
proper proper health organization stepping forward and that's getting rid

1689
04:30:01,180 --> 04:30:12,459
of this shit that's all we can really do yeah I heard about the cases in in

1690
04:30:12,459 --> 04:30:18,739
Massachusetts to Vegas just had a one just pop up now to take yesterday the

1691
04:30:18,739 --> 04:30:26,000
day before so it's it's it's spreading over here it's happening here it's

1692
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:35,690
hopefully not to the extent that it could but stay safe glad to hang out

1696
04:30:55,190 --> 04:30:59,350
these past few months and by using echolocation with my extremely high IQ I

1697
04:30:59,350 --> 04:31:03,750
triangulated your exact address now confirm that it's pronounced juke not

1698

juke jump not juke or I will really all right well this is a scary message this

Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter Jupiter is incorrect it's Jupiter Jupiter imagine

1701
04:31:36,520 --> 04:31:45,760
