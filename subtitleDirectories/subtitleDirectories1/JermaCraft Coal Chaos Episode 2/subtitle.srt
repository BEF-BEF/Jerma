1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,139
It's not Germacraft unless you have something crazy happen, so I'm gonna go fight this asshole over here.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:12,380
Get this cows too. Do I have- I don't even have a sword.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,419
This is gonna be interesting.

4
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,219
I should have just made one. I should have just made a sword. What am I doing? Why am I doing this?

5
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:24,620
Why am I going after this guy right now? What is the matter with me?

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,969
You see, my brain does not work in ways that you would think it should.

7
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,769
I'm definitely gonna die.

8
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,770
This is the stupidest idea ever.

9
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,770
That was the dumbest thing I've ever done in this game.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,289
I don't even have a spawn point. Oh, great.

11
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,229
At least there's cows.

12
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:46,329
Mountain cows.

13
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:48,329
Whoa. Where's my diving board?

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,500
Where's my diving board?

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I made a diving board. Where is it?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Oh!

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Coal! There's coal right there. There's coal right there.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Get away from me.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Get away from me.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, there's three creepers? What are you kidding me?

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,500
This is insane.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,189
What the hell?

23
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:09,189
Come on now.

24
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,390
You can't get up here.

25
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,019
You know what? Blow up.

26
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:17,019
I dare you. I dare you.

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:20,920
Good. I'm right next to you. Blow up.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Get out of here.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Get the hell away from me.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Everybody just blow up right now. Go. Blow up.

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,019
I want to see the hole that made.

32
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,019
Oh, there's my diving board.

33
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,640
All right.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,030
That actually looks kind of cool.

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,040
Did I make it? I made it.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,280
Wait a second. How did this happen?

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
They're all here too? There's like ten people down here.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,349
What is going on?

39
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,349
Oh, my God. Oh, hey. More people.

40
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,349
Might as well just run off the cliff.

41
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:58,090
Okay.

42
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,090
So I've successfully made a hole

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,090
in my basement.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,090
Where I'm hiding from all the things

45
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,090
that have been just killing me over and over again.

46
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,389
And I'm surrounded

47
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,389
right now. By mobs.

48
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,210
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,770
Can you hear them all?

50
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,770
They're all over the water.

51
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,330
I feel like I'm in a Stephen King movie.

52
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,080
Shouldn't they be dying right now?

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,639
Am I missing? Look at all the arrows.

54
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,639
My house

55
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,639
is riddled with arrows.

56
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,639
Oh, my God.

57
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,969
It looks like this is like

58
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:39,379
part of the Lord of the Rings set.

59
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,379
Why are they not dying? It's bright as

60
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,650
hell out. There we go.

61
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,539
Now they're on fire.

62
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,699
Or are they? They should be.

63
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,699
Oh, look at that. Oh, look at this.

64
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,699
Oh, what happened?

65
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,699
What happened?

66
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:01,129
Did you die?

67
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:03,750
Why is that guy still alive?

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,750
I'm not going to question that.

69
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,490
Whatever.

70
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,490
Okay, now let me rethink

71
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,490
what I'm doing here. Okay, I've got to collect

72
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,240
some of this because I'm an idiot and I died.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Just going to get a pickaxe, go down there, get some coal.

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,120
And I should be good to go.

75
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,139
There we are.

76
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,139
So while I have the light, I need to do this.

77
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,580
Wait, where's my original crafting

78
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
table? What the hell happened to my crafting table?

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,900
Whatever.

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,569
Yeah, I'm crazy if I think.

81
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,569
Oh, I'm going to have a castle built.

82
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,569
I'm going to have a nice castle

83
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,569
built by Christmas time. Yeah, right.

84
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,189
Alright, let's find

85
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,189
some of this. There's definitely going to be coal down here.

86
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:57,189
I know for a fact there is.

87
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,189
They wouldn't have this much crap everywhere without coal

88
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,189
being right there.

89
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,460
At least I can get some tools, different tools.

90
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,719
Listen to that music.

91
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,900
More

92
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,669
caves. That's just fantastic.

93
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,189
Alright, no coal

94
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,939
yet.

95
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,379
There's coal right there. Found it.

96
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,379
I got a bunch of butt heads to deal with.

97
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:28,149
I feel

98
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:31,220
like I'm playing the drums.

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
There it is.

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,100
There's the coal.

101
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,540
That's what I'm looking for.

102
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,779
Will you die already?

103
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,139
Give me a break.

104
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,819
Alright, here it is.

105
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,819
Just need one piece of freaking coal.

106
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,250
For the love

107
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,250
of all that is sacred

108
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,250
on planet Earth. Just give me the coal.

109
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,449
Oh my god.

110
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:02,579
Finally.

111
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,579
Alright, get me the hell back up

112
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,579
so I can start to actually play this game.

113
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,269
I'm just

114
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,269
using my walls.

115
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,980
Oh yeah, that's fine. I'm just going to tear down

116
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
my own walls to get wood.

117
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,149
And it's this, right? Yeah.

118
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,149
Success. Okay, great.

119
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:29,379
So now, let's

120
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,649
do this. Let's make a little

121
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,649
small house so I don't get

122
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,079
mutilated when it becomes night time.

123
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,620
That's good enough.

124
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,500
I just need a bed.

125
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It needs to be higher than that.

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh god, it needs to be at least one

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,410
block higher than that. This is temporary.

128
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,410
This is temporary. I promise this is temporary.

129
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,079
A piece of sand.

130
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,079
Look at this mess.

131
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,959
This is the worst house

132
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,959
I've ever seen in Minecraft.

133
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:07,350
Ever.

134
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,529
Alright. At least I have some

135
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,220
light in my own house.

136
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,589
Gotta pay the electric bill. Well there's more coal

137
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:20,089
over here. That's definitely a start.

138
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,839
That's definitely a good thing.

139
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,019
Pick that up. Definitely.

140
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,350
I came over here for those,

141
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,420
that tree right there. But I need

142
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,370
this coal too. The fun part about Minecraft

143
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,370
is you can kind of just get distracted

144
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,370
and just go do whatever you feel like

145
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,139
however long you're doing it.

146
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,139
That's good. There's a little more over here I saw.

147
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,699
Get out of the way. Where was it?

148
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,329
Where was it? Where was it?

149
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:53,980
No, that's a shovel.

150
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,350
Thought I saw more. Oh well.

151
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,740
I came over here for this single

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,220
out of place tree. Let there be light.

153
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,649
Aim up.

154
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,649
Always cut down the whole tree or else it won't

155
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,660
disappear. That's what grandpa

156
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,300
told me. Cause he raged one,

157
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,949
he raged one time. The whole tree

158
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,949
you gotta cut down the whole god damn

159
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:28,660
tree Jeremy. And I said why?

160
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,220
Why would I want to do that?

161
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,220
Because it's against the law if you don't.

162
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,740
Yeah it's against the law.

163
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,670
I don't think so grandpa.

164
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,810
I think you're just nuts.

165
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,540
Starting to get dark. This is a big damn

166
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
this is a big tree. This has so much wood in it.

167
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,550
It's got a lot of wood in this tree.

168
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,579
That's actually a good thing cause I don't want to come back

169
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:01,829
and do it again. Hello, excuse me.

170
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:06,439
No I hate when this happens.

171
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,810
Now I gotta like, ugh. Let me get all

172
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,180
up in this tree. Can I put a

173
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
no I can't put a torch down right there.

174
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,629
There's so much wood in this tree.

175
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,629
It's unbelievable how much wood is in this tree.

176
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,629
Is that it? Oh my god.

177
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:24,540
There's more wood in this tree.

178
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
This is insane.

179
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,860
This entire tree is just a big huge

180
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,100
block of wood. Usually there's only

181
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,539
a few. I'm confused.

182
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,860
Oh my god.

183
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Whatever. Here's the last one right here.

184
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,610
I'm outta here.

185
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,610
Give me the torch. I'm going back

186
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,740
home. Look at that beautiful

187
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,240
moon. So elegant.

188
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,529
Okay so I got that wood. Let's do

189
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,919
something with it. Let's make it into a bunch

190
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:04,870
of things.

191
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,299
Just shift click. Alright let's make

192
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,299
this into a ton of sticks.

193
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,259
Shift click and where's

194
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,259
my crafting bench? It's down there.

195
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,629
Alright let's at least cover this

196
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,629
hole up so I can not get murdered if

197
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:24,090
somebody comes and gets me. I have my house

198
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,090
made out of like three different materials

199
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,740
right now. I'll tell you it

200
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,909
will make progress. If you

201
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,909
are watching this video for the first time

202
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,909
and there's like 15 episodes ahead

203
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,909
of this, I promise this is not

204
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,909
gonna be this much of a mess through the

205
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,909
whole series. Promise.

206
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,289
And if it is, then

207
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,620
whoops.

208
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,860
This would be my nice little cave house

209
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,080
for the time being. This is it

210
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,090
right here. Where is my...

211
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,029
There we go. Let's just close it up.

212
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,720
No sense in just

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,500
sitting here like this. Here we

214
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,860
go. My house is pretty much

215
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,870
complete. At least my

216
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,580
caveman house is. Let's get in there.

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,019
Oh my god. Where's my

218
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,190
certificate? Where's my certificate for

219
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,690
first house built? Cause it just happened.

220
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,629
Make it... Oh my god! No!

221
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,629
No! No!

222
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,129
No!

223
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,299
That could have been bad. Imagine if I just

224
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,299
drowned myself. That would be terrible.
