1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:15,220
Hey, how are you? This is your first stream you've ever been to? Wait, what's wrong? Oh, there's no music, hold on.

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:24,410
There, I got you, I got you, I got you. Sorry. What's up? How are you? Good to see you. The music is too quiet.

3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,370
I got it, I got you, I got you, I got you. New, that way, this new person in the community? Hey, what's happening?

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:38,780
Ah, welcome. Gonna be a very short stream today. Very, very busy. We're gonna do, we're gonna hang out,

5
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,020
we'll talk about the chess boxing event. That was crazy, that was a lot of fun. I want to talk about

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,530
the Christmas stream coming up this weekend. That's gonna be a lot of fun too. It's not gonna be

7
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:59,700
15 minutes. No, I don't know, like, maybe like an hour? Couple hours? Whatever. Maybe like an hour and a half?

8
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:08,599
I don't know. Yeah, I want, I was trying to figure out an opportunity to be live because of all this

9
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:14,120
stuff going on. So, like, I got, there's a point right now where I could be live and just chill for

10
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:31,299
an hour or two. Have I taken a shower? Yes. Yes. I did take a shower. Did you? I have something very

11
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:40,310
important to go over. It's, it's how we're gonna open this. I've seen, I've seen some fake information

12
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,209
on the internet about how I take photos. And I'm gonna prove to everybody today exactly what's,

13
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:53,219
because I've seen it and it's making me a little irritated. You will go over it. I, it's gonna be

14
00:01:53,219 --> 00:02:01,780
fine. And I'll be able to prove to everybody that no, I in fact am not standing on my tippy toes

15
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,140
in every photo to make sure that I'm 5'9 standing next to somebody that's 5'10.

16
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:14,900
That is not what is happening. And I keep seeing it. I keep seeing people go into the background

17
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,780
and go to where my feet are and they zoom in and they sharpen it and they sharpen it and they go,

18
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,979
look at his foot, look at his foot's off the ground. And I'm like, hey, that's not what's happening.

19
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:32,039
And I'm gonna prove it today. I want, I have to prove this because I was gonna like say something

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,240
I was like, what the hell would he, what's he talking about? I was gonna write, no,

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,879
just a tweet. I don't tweet ever, right? And imagine getting a tweet that's just me with no

22
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,560
context. No, I don't stand on my tippy toes in photos. Stop saying that about me. It's just like,

23
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,229
that's kind of weird. A post, like a really fun event. It'd be very strange to say. I just didn't.

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,539
But yeah, I, it's funny. I get it. But I'm gonna prove everybody today. And you need to see this

25
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:09,189
because there's no chance I'm gonna let that continue to stand. He doesn't have feet. Yes,

26
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,300
I do. We'll get, I'll prove it. But I want to wait. I want to wait till people get here

27
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,159
because it's, I want to wait for people trickling in. How come there's no comb today?

28
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:28,099
Guys, I lost it. I don't know. I don't know where it is for free. We're going to get a feed cam.

29
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:35,560
I mean, kind of, I guess it's, I mean, it's the focus of the first few minutes of the stream

30
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:42,060
are going to be me, how I stand in a photo. So I guess technically, technically, I guess

31
00:03:42,780 --> 00:04:09,139
you ate the comb. Finally. He's looking sus today. I'm not even on camera. Skyrim, bro. Play it

32
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,250
already. I don't have time to play Skyrim today. I'm sorry. I'm not, I'm not playing Skyrim.

33
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:24,199
Get on cam right now. I'm just wait. It's the intro. Okay. How five minutes, what is the

34
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:29,160
percentage of five minutes to an hour? 60 minutes. What's five minutes of 60 minutes? What percentage

35
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:46,649
is that? How much percentage is that? 5% 6%. So 6% of this whole stream is already over. Oh shit.

36
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,430
That's actually kind of sad to think like that. Uh, that's a glass half empty mentality. I don't

37
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:08,120
like that. 8.3% of the stream is already over. What the hell? Show us the feet already then.

38
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,259
All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

39
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,339
Before we go over anything, obviously I've got, I've got to look, I've got a big event to hype.

40
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:33,670
I got a big event to hype this weekend. Stop wasting percentages. Okay. All right. All right.

41
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,269
All right. All right. All right. It's time. You guys ready? It's going to be jarring to a lot

42
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,980
of people because they're not used to seeing me like in a big, like full cam like this. And yeah.

43
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,089
Oh, it looks weird today. I don't care. What happened? Why does it look like you say computer

44
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:53,610
generator? It's because I am. All right. Fine. Whatever. How are you guys doing? Are you ready

45
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,370
for me to prove this? I'm going to go put like fucking shoes on. No, I don't even care. All

46
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,910
right. Here we go. There are, there are photos circulating of me staying. I took a lot of photos.

47
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,389
First of all, I took a lot of pictures at the chest boxing event, which was an unbelievable

48
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,230
event. That was a ton of fun. I've never done something like that, but there's a dick on the

49
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:48,069
what? Why is this drive? What the fuck? Hold on a second. Where is it coming? Where's that coming

50
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:56,790
from? I don't even, I don't know. I don't know what's even making that. Why is that there?

51
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:05,769
I, what's, I don't, I have no idea what could be doing that. Anyways, let's go for it. Here we go.

52
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:11,019
You ready? I've got to prove. Look, let me explain what's going on first. The dog hair all over me.

53
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:13,980
All right. Here we go. I got to do this because you're not going to be able to see me standing.

54
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:21,990
All right. So there's a lot of people that say he goes on his tippy toes. Look, just watch,

55
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,350
watch what he does. All those people are going to all have a fit at the same time. You ready? Watch

56
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,699
this. So I'm, I have to get the whole thing because there's no way people are going to

57
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:39,000
fucking clip it. They're going to like shrink me and hold on. We're not doing anything else

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,730
today until I do this. It's actually very important. Okay. So here we go. Can you hear me?

59
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:55,800
When I take photos, right? I stand, you know, sometimes you stand like this. Sometimes like a

60
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,680
photo. Sometimes you go like this. I took probably 200 photos with a crew and, and, and fans and,

61
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,160
and what have people came, the people that went to the event. It was awesome. It was like one of

62
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,240
the best experiences I've ever had in my whole life. So anyways, some of these photos, they,

63
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:19,990
they show my feet and people go, Oh bro, bro, LOL. Because my foot is like this. Are you ready for

64
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,829
this? So I pose. I pose when I take photos like this, you know, like, okay, here we go. Let's,

65
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:32,220
let's go ahead and see what happens. Let's pose. Hey, I'm posing right now. Let's put it down.

66
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:39,639
Nothing changed. It's just my knee coming out. It's just like, all right, let's go for it.

67
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:52,620
And people are saying, it's me going like this. I, no, it's not. It's this or this.

68
00:08:53,259 --> 00:09:00,980
Sometimes it's back here. I didn't just grow in size, did I? I'm leaning on my left leg.

69
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:20,980
Look, nothing changed. I've been the exact same height. Ready? If you walk, bro, there you go.

70
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:39,669
Get this dick out of my room. How do I get rid of it? I don't know what's causing it. I'm not

71
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:43,210
touching it. I'm not going to touch it because people, hold on. Wait, I'm getting in front of it.

72
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:52,659
What is it? Okay. I'm blocking whatever it is right now. What is it? Tell me if it changes.

73
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:29,110
Changing this. I don't, I, I don't know why that's there. I, whatever. Okay. Hi, dude. I have to get

74
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:41,799
rid of people. That's so fucking stupid. What if, hold on, let me refresh the camera. No, it's just

75
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:47,899
there. It's probably, all right. It's going to change over time. Look, it's already moved.

76
00:10:47,899 --> 00:11:07,750
This is actually insane. It's, it's, it's like shape shifting. It's going to, it's just going to

77
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:15,429
go, it's just going to go. All right. Anyways, so the chest boxing event was awesome, right? I,

78
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:23,980
I have never gone into a ring and done anything like that before. And I have to say being in front

79
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:33,100
of a huge audience, a huge crowd, it was like electric. It was so electric, in fact, that in

80
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:41,590
the intro, I got shown a lot of pictures. There's a point in the intro where my hair is standing up

81
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:49,700
like I'm being electrocuted. I got to find a photo and put up here. My hair was standing up as if I

82
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:58,019
was touching one of those, one of those electric kind of science balls. I have no idea why, because

83
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,570
it didn't happen during the rest of the event. There was so much that I think it was just the

84
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,210
arena was just so electric and maybe, I don't know, maybe there was some static in the air,

85
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:13,740
but it was, it was embarrassing because every major photo that I keep seeing from this is

86
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:24,700
that intro where I'm pointing into the crowd and my hair is like crazy looking. Is the dry air?

87
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:32,629
I don't know. You look like you, you look like you grocery shop at 6 a.m.

88
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:44,309
Uh dude, I don't, I don't, I haven't woken up at 6 a.m. since I was probably like fucking 10 years

89
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:54,330
old. You think I get up that early to go grocery shopping? You think, you think I've woken up

90
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:03,429
at 6 a.m. at any point in the last 15 years? No. Well, now you, it's no longer, it's no longer

91
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:13,610
a penis now. Now it's a just a series of three balls. Somebody said, is it culled in there?

92
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,399
6 a.m. comb stream. All right, but no, no, no. Okay, all right, all right, let's get on track.

93
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,409
Let's get on track. So a couple important things to know. One, the, there it is. All right,

94
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:35,240
I have to show this. Hold on. Wait, I'm going to go away for a second. I just want to make sure

95
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:47,940
this isn't, I have this in the right spot. Okay, so hold on. I'm just going to call it this. That's

96
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:59,559
fine. Okay, hold on. I don't use computers. And there we go. Okay, can you see it? No, you can't,

97
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:10,250
but you can in a, you will in a second. All right, so take a look. That's, this, that's kind of

98
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:22,059
insane. But it's weird because this didn't, it wasn't like that for the rest of the night.

99
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:28,389
You look like a mad scientist. Yeah, I don't know why it was happening, but it was funny nonetheless.

100
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:35,509
It's in all the professional photos. It's in all the, it's every, all the pro photos, the professional

101
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:41,590
photography that was taken, it looks way worse because it's so high definition, it's so HD.

102
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:48,740
But anyways, yeah, that's that. I've never done that before. It was really fun, but we have to

103
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,539
make, wait, let's, let's move on because we are, what's 15 minutes out of an hour? What is it?

104
00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:06,009
15 minutes out of an hour is how, what percentage? 25% of this stream is over already. And all that

105
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:14,980
happened was a, a dick was on the wall. I mean, that's actually kind of, that's a kind of a major

106
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:21,059
event, wouldn't you say? That's kind of, that's a major event. All right, whatever. That's weird,

107
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:31,590
but we got to, all right. Anyways, so the haul, the, the holiday, I said how the holiday show

108
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,570
is this weekend. What you're going to want to do if you haven't, I haven't, because I haven't been

109
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:44,100
live, the poll, you have only a couple days left to vote on the poll. If you haven't do it,

110
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:53,210
you have only a few days. It's a huge poll. It's going to take you like all day. Somebody said

111
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:59,379
there are too many nominees, too many options. There were so many, you guys have no idea.

112
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:06,200
The mods got it first. All the nominees, they brought it down on a first pass. There were

113
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:14,440
thousands of thousands of nominations. When it went down for the first mod pass, me and Holly

114
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,279
took a look at it. Okay, we got to narrow some more of this stuff down. This is way too much.

115
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:27,830
You are seeing three passes of removing nominees from that list. And it's still that much. There

116
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:34,330
were 50 nominees in every category. It was crazy. It took me one and a half hours to go through it.

117
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,490
You can skip questions, by the way, if you don't care about what the worst cat puke was, which

118
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,169
is I think probably the most skipped question on the whole poll, which is understandable.

119
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:47,450
You don't have to. You can just do the ones that you want to do. If like worst joke of the year,

120
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,370
you're just like, nah, I don't need to vote for that. Like, I mean, they were all like pretty good.

121
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,769
So just skip that one if you want to. That one, you should be skipping it and then go to the best

122
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,009
stuff, right? This worst face, worst joke, worst impression, you just skip those. You don't need

123
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:05,609
to do them. You can just do the best ones. Those are the ones that are the better ones, right? Yeah.

124
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:15,049
I almost just puked on my own spit. Oh, it's a panel, right? Below here, there's a panel that has

125
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:20,009
that link. If you don't feel like clicking on the link that showed up in the chat a thousand times.

126
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:24,970
Down here, there's a chat panel. New cat puke. You can't vote for it because in the gray period,

127
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:39,109
it's in the gray area. You can't do it. Dude, wait, what did you just say? Hold on. Remember,

128
00:17:39,109 --> 00:18:00,390
you look like the yellow Eminem today. Yeah, I kind of do. What are you talking about? Why

129
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:37,480
did you know that? Why are you talking about that? Hold on a sec. Let's freak some people out that

130
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:51,529
just show up for the stream randomly. Oh, the yellow Eminem looks like he's trying to go on

131
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:58,230
his tippy toes, isn't he? With this picture. No, it's called a pose actually. What's going on down

132
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:33,460
here? Why are you doing that? Oh, it's called a pose. Give me a break. I don't look anything

133
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:54,039
like this guy. You have the same hair. That's not hair. Those are eyebrows. That's a dude. Wait,

134
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:09,099
you think this is his hair? That's not his hair. Those are eyebrows. That's actually kind of funny

135
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:35,740
because now I'm going to see that as his hair forever. You have the same eyebrows. Do I? I don't

136
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:56,119
have the same visor. Hey, uh, hey, uh, red Eminem. I think I, uh, oh, does Santa exist? No, he doesn't.

137
00:20:56,119 --> 00:21:14,309
Don't worry. Is that close? Guys, I think they sell this hat. I could probably, they probably sell

138
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:28,359
this. Bernie Sanders. No, that's, hey, uh, hey, um, I think that, uh, we're Eminems. It's like that.

139
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:36,069
Yeah, he does exist. I do exist. Oh, I was doing Santa from that commercial. Hey, oh, yeah. Uh,

140
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:46,180
whoops. That's my bad. All right. Anyways, well, let's try the other way. I think this is actually

141
00:21:46,180 --> 00:22:30,359
closer. This is not, oh, that's not right. No, I'm trying to just get it to be, you get the idea.

142
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:37,500
Who cares? All right. Anyways, what were we just talking about? Oops. All right. What were we

143
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:46,970
talking about? He's got a green, he's green mouth. All right. So yeah, there's nothing on the wall

144
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,890
anymore. We can move on. That just, we, that derailed 25% of the whole stream, by the way,

145
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:57,859
just in case you were wondering. So if you want to vote, the vote is open still. It's a big poll.

146
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:03,019
You don't have to vote on every single question if you don't want to. If it's there, if you want,

147
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:09,099
we're tallying it soon. It's going to be a really fun show. A lot of stuff planned for that show.

148
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:17,269
That is the 17th, starting at 4 p.m. Pacific time. You are going to see, I'm going to tweet about it.

149
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,829
There's going to be a big tweet. It's going to be tons of fun. I really hope that you show up there

150
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:34,410
because it's going to be a great time. Twizzler here. Do you do all your clothes shopping at the

151
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:42,900
kids section at Target? No. I actually do all my clothes shopping eight or nine years ago

152
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,450
and have never updated my wardrobe because it still fits. Should I be ashamed about that?

153
00:23:50,390 --> 00:24:00,630
Oh, no. Oh, no. Back when I was 25, 24. Oh, my clothes still fit and I still feel just as

154
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:13,720
I fill out the clothes just like I did when I was in my mid-20s. Oh, no. Look at that. That's

155
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:25,420
pretty sustainable. I just, is this one backwards? No, I just, I can't buy new clothes. I always

156
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:31,369
forget everything about my body shape. Anytime you go get real clothes, you have to know stuff like

157
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:35,930
what's the diameter of your diaphragm? And like, you know, what's the, how long around your neck

158
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:42,329
is it? Yeah. How many inches? Well, you know, it's, I have a 30, 38, R slash, you know, slim fit.

159
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:52,059
It's too much to know. I don't care. I just, if it says M on it, I buy it. How long are these pants,

160
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:58,619
by the way? Oh, I, you see, I'm a 30, 30 waist, 32 waist and I have like a 30, 31. No, it's too much.

161
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:08,710
I don't care. Just give me a medium. Just give me a medium. And I like pants that like you can just

162
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:16,660
go like stretch. You know what I mean? Surprise, it's not extra small. I'm not, I, are you serious?

163
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:25,339
Do I have to stand up again? Is this extra small? That's extra small. That's extra small. But you

164
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:32,730
know what I mean? I don't, this arm is not extra small. I could lift, you know, if you, if you were

165
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:46,069
like right here, I could lift, I could lift you up. I'm not extra small. I'm just, I'm five, eight.

166
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:52,009
I don't, I fill out a medium shirt, by the way. I fill out a, what's, I'm not going to answer that.

167
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,720
No, you could not. Are you telling me that I don't fill out a medium shirt? Well, what is this? No,

168
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:10,970
I like this. Don't rip it. Would you consider this not being filled out? I want it. Tell me the truth.

169
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm directly looking at you. Am I not filling this shirt out? This is a long sleeve shirt. You know,

170
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:34,839
I'm not filling this out nicely. This is a medium. And I got, hey, no further questions.

171
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,299
Looks a bit, it looks a bit tight. Dude, you couldn't lift a TV. That TV was 200 pounds, dude.

172
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:50,579
We weighed it on stream. Do you not remember that? Or were you not here for it? We weighed that TV

173
00:26:50,579 --> 00:27:07,539
on stream and it was almost 200 pounds. Anyways, he's very feisty because I'm excited. It's going

174
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:18,380
to be a really fun weekend this weekend. I'm looking forward to it. Show us the tag because

175
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:25,700
if this is small, then I have to backtrack every single thing I said for the last 10 minutes.

176
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:34,039
This is the first comb stream for me. This is the first comb stream and it's found you through the

177
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:40,200
Hassan collab. I've been watching you ever since. What's the baseball stream? Oh, well,

178
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:52,299
the last part you made that up. What's a comb stream? A comb stream is, I used to comb my hair

179
00:27:52,299 --> 00:28:02,380
and sit here for an hour and that's what it was. Do a fashion brand tier list? No, no, I don't think

180
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:14,980
so. All right. Well, actually I could. Hold on. Let me think. No, I couldn't. I would low key like

181
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:26,250
to see that. But what if I don't know? What if I don't know anything about clothes? And that's the

182
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:33,210
thing. Look, I know a lot of people really, people love fashion. They get into clothing and that's

183
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,890
awesome. That's cool. You can really express yourself with all kinds of clothes and different

184
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:45,079
styles and stuff, but I'm a gray sweatshirt Andy. I just, that's it. Gray sweatshirt Andy. I didn't

185
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,490
even need to be a name brand. I don't even care what it is. And running pants or jeans, just like

186
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,930
a standard, like gray sweatshirt, gray shirt Andy and jeans. I do like nice jeans though. A nice

187
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:08,869
pair of jeans is good. I will spend money on jeans. That's Mark Zuckerberg. You're wearing designer

188
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:17,660
brand right now? These are Nike pants. Are these, is Nike designer? Is Nike, no, Nike's not designer

189
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:34,009
brand. Is it? Are they? You have the Brett Favre outfits? Wait, Brett Favre wears gray shirts and

190
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:49,769
jeans? Yeah, but I mean, but it's, but they're comfortable. They're comfortable. I, I get so

191
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:54,809
sweat. Okay, so that suit, that was a pretty nice suit. I got it. I got it. It was a nice suit.

192
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:00,569
It fit pretty well, but I just feel, I just don't, I'd rather just be in a gray shirt and a

193
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:06,940
pair of jeans. Play Minesweeper. No, I'm not playing Minesweeper. I'd rather play Picross.

194
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:20,789
Do you remember wear it 50% right now? Well, that's not necessarily the case. Does Zuckerberg fit?

195
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:26,660
Is it? No, not really. Is it? Maybe a little. Is that the same suit from the Streamer Awards?

196
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,950
Nope, that one's different because I wanted to be in a black suit because announcer, right? I don't

197
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,170
know. I don't know the announcer fit that well. So that suit was blue. It was like kind of a bright

198
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:58,200
blue suit. You can do the Vampire Survivors DLC. You better believe it. Can you do a wood cutting

199
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,190
stream? No, compare your height to the door. I just did it. You know, all these height obsessed

200
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:29,220
handies in this chat. Who cares? If you're five, five, six feet, five, seven, five, eight, who cares?

201
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:36,920
It doesn't matter. Everybody gets on there like binoculars. How tall is he next to that person?

202
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:53,720
Hey, who cares? Considering you're like sorcery so much. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What'd you say?

203
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,940
Did you ever play the other Steve Jackson games like Warlock of Firetop Mountain? I did. I played

204
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:10,230
Warlock of Firetop Mountain on stream. It was the digital version of it though. It was pretty good.

205
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,819
Elden Ring update. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff. I don't know. We'll see. Can you please change your

206
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:27,480
pinned tweet? Maybe that's my New Year's resolution. My New Year's resolution. That's what it is.

207
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:38,519
Change my pinned tweet. Not, oh, I want to, you know, do this this year. I want to get in shape

208
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,640
this year. Oh, I'd like to do, I'm going to go to, I'm going to travel Europe this, maybe this year.

209
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:56,250
No, I'm going to change my pinned tweet. What a lazy fucking asshole. What a lazy asshole. Really?

210
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:05,339
I could do it right now. I could, it's right there. I could pick it up and I could change

211
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:15,690
my pinned tweet right now. I'm looking at it. My phone is right there. I'm, it's right here.

212
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,809
I could pick it up and I could change it to anything, but I'm not going to.

213
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:34,380
Try what's your six pack? All right, sure. No, no, we're not doing that. What's the plan today?

214
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:42,119
This is the plan. Christmas stream, holiday stream is coming up. There's going to be a tweet

215
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:51,640
about it. It's going to be a big show. I'm very, very excited for it. 17th, 4 p.m. Pacific. You

216
00:33:51,640 --> 00:34:03,130
should be there. Take the wig off. No, I just got it on the right way. It's going to get delayed?

217
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:16,280
What? No, it's not. How's my health been? It's been all right. I don't talk about it anymore

218
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,960
because I think it's a downer for the streams, but it's still there. It's still something I

219
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,460
have to deal with. I have to figure out how I'm going to exactly do it, but I don't talk

220
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,530
about it anymore because I don't want it to be every, to get real for a second and not mess

221
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:40,889
around. To be able to talk about medical issues that I'm having, as long as I'm all right and

222
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:47,269
it's not going to take away from the actual streams and stuff, I'm not going to bring it

223
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:56,519
up every day. I did that for a while. I did. Back, I want to say back in early, in mid-2020

224
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:03,699
into 2021, it was something I talked about every day and I felt like it was kind of a downer. So

225
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:15,800
I just kind of kept at it. Still keeping at it. It was June 2020. Yeah. Give us updates. I will

226
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:24,420
if they come up. It didn't come off that way. Yeah, I know, but still. I'd rather this channel

227
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:32,099
be more about having a good time and just messing around and having fun than, I don't know, talking

228
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:44,760
about personal shit. But you know, that's the way it is. What do you say? You're going to add more

229
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,199
channel point rewards. Oh yeah, I forgot about that. I was supposed to add a bunch of channel

230
00:35:48,199 --> 00:36:09,960
point stuff. What do you got? Let's see. Are there any more winks? No, not anymore. Can you do a VR

231
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:18,230
welding stream? Wait, you mean like get in the in the VR helmet and weld in VR? VR is something

232
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:30,570
that just really just destroys me every time. It really does. Do you like your car seat? I don't

233
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:38,650
have a car seat. Oh, you were saying, do you like your car seat headrest? I thought you were saying,

234
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:47,500
do you like your car seat? And I'm like, you're you're being kind of a dick. I don't even think

235
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:58,380
about that. I don't think about my whatever. When I'm driving, I don't sit there and go,

236
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:10,630
how does it feel? I don't I think it's it's fine. That's a band. Oh, it's a band. Oh, please,

237
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:23,769
Jerma. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I don't know anything. That went all over the

238
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:27,769
place. First, I thought you were making fun of me. Then I thought you actually wanted to ask a real

239
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:31,690
question about my how comfortable I was sitting in my car while I'm driving. And then I realized

240
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:40,969
that was wrong. That was almost strike three. Guys, he's like 38. Why would he listen to car

241
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:57,690
seat headrest? I don't know. I don't know. Hope they're good. Cool. It's a cool band, I guess.

242
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:19,610
I don't know. When are you gonna do modded Skyrim? Dude, you're the same age as my dad. I still fit

243
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:36,019
into my medium. All right. I still fit into my medium shirt. OK, I've still a medium. What does

244
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:44,630
that mean? I don't even know. I don't know what that's supposed to mean. But you're almost 40.

245
00:38:44,630 --> 00:39:01,000
That chatter is 10. Is it mature content wording? You got to click that shit. Excuse me. I thought

246
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,360
you were 45. No, I just want everybody to think I'm 45. So when they actually figure out that I'm

247
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:12,780
37, they go, Whoa, he's oh, that's not 45. Oh, that's a lot younger than I thought. And yeah,

248
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:24,650
and I get and I went with 67% of the way through the stream. Oh, don't pass Jerma the aux cord.

249
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:40,469
Everybody was listening to me. Yeah, give it to me, actually. Give me the aux cord. You know why?

250
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:47,989
Because I would play like Halloween music through it and everyone would be at the party like,

251
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,659
yes, sick. And then all of a sudden they'd hear like,

252
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:00,260
and people would be like, who fucking did that? Who has the aux cord? Where are my jams?

253
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:10,170
Put on the monster bash. Actually, I think I think any party would like to hear that.

254
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:21,559
Honestly, tell me the truth. And I want ones in chat if you agree. If you were at a get together

255
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,659
or a party or some like nice event or an event or something that you went to,

256
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:32,039
if the monster mash came on loud, you would go like this, wouldn't you? And I know this is what

257
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:41,300
I would do. I'd go, yeah, yes. Oh, yeah. It was the monster mash. The monster. Everyone would just

258
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,510
start doing it. Nobody would be annoyed at that. No, it's not a Halloween party. This is at any

259
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:56,300
moment of any party you've ever gone to. I think I don't think I would trust the person that would

260
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:02,599
be upset that the monster mash was playing at the party. If somebody were there like,

261
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:12,460
this is stupid. What a dumb song. This is a fucking dumb song. You'd be like, well,

262
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:30,920
lose my number. The monster mash at Christmas. I hate the monster mash. Why? It's this,

263
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,599
I'm changing this because I don't want people to go like, oh, look at his hair over his eye.

264
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,920
You wouldn't play it at a funeral. No, you wouldn't. But what do you, what?

265
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,559
Okay, but hold on a minute. You wouldn't, oh, you wouldn't play that at a funeral. What,

266
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:06,380
what is appropriate for you to play at a funeral? That's not, you're going to play other, what other

267
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,400
music are you playing at the funeral? That's not monster mash. I don't think very much music fits

268
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:20,219
at a funeral, besides something, you know, unless it was a special request from somebody, right?

269
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:26,059
Their favorites. Yeah, that's what I mean. But okay, if the monster mash was their favorite song,

270
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:35,030
that's actually, all right, that gets everybody happy, I think. If it was like, yes, and now we're

271
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:42,309
going to thank you for those very good words, those kind words. Now, as we lower the casket,

272
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:56,170
we are going to be listening to his favorite song, monster mash. And it's just like, hold on,

273
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,900
how does it go? I need to hear it. I think that would be actually pretty, I don't know,

274
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:55,000
if they wanted to be there, then whatever. Monster mash. Is it going down? Okay, that's going off.

275
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,559
DMCA. Now, I mean, honestly, if I think about some of the all-time greatest pieces of music

276
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:08,550
to ever release, this has to be somewhere in the top 500, right? This is, would you put this in the

277
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:14,710
top 500 songs ever made? And I'm talking even Mozart and shit. Every piece of music ever,

278
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:23,110
ever invented, ever created, any Mozart, anybody. I think this fits in the top five, I think this

279
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:31,579
is in the top 500. What do you mean no? Yes, how would it not be? You don't think that this would be

280
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:35,659
in the same realm as Beethoven's like, fifth symphony.

281
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:40,420
Yeah, top 500. Do we do a Beethoven listening party? That would be strange. Would it be that

282
00:45:40,420 --> 00:46:01,530
strange? I'd do a full Beethoven listening party. Is Beethoven DMCA? No, is it? Does anybody own

283
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:11,210
Beethoven's rights or something? What's the most famous Beethoven symphony? Beethoven famous song.

284
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,329
And don't tell me that that was weird for me to write because that was literally people were

285
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:22,599
writing that. That's like a huge, everyone's like typing that. Here we go, the best of Beethoven.

286
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,559
Wait, okay, does, is Beethoven the one that goes...

287
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:44,969
Is that Beethoven? That's Mozart, okay. Wait, is Beethoven the one that goes...

288
00:46:56,469 --> 00:47:07,050
No, who's that? Not Star Wars, that's the Bumblebee song. That's not Star Wars. That wasn't Star

289
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:36,570
Wars, that was the Flight of the Bumblebee. What? Hold on, is it Star? No, it's not. What did I do?

290
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:43,539
This sounds like somebody desperately tried to get around, tried to make it so this wasn't that song,

291
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:49,849
but that's what they're doing. It sounds like the royalty-free version of that song that you're

292
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:56,219
talking about the... Dula Fates. This is the kind of shit that people would do, and I'm not saying

293
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:02,619
this is an unbelievably classic, unbelievable song. Huge music history, right? I'm just saying that

294
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:06,940
you think that I was doing Star Wars when I was just doing one of the most in the top 500 songs

295
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:15,429
ever made. I don't think Dula Fates is top 500 songs ever made. This should be there. Dula Fates

296
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:25,050
is not in there. This is in there. That's a bad take. I thought you hated classical music. What?

297
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:34,949
I mean, I don't like listen... All right, that was me saying I don't like listen to... Not like I

298
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:45,559
don't like classical music. I don't like listen to it. Get a comb. No, I don't have one. Wait,

299
00:48:45,559 --> 00:49:00,340
Beethoven. So wait, what about... Wait. That's Beethoven. All right. What's the number one

300
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:12,420
most important song ever made? I don't know. What's the most important song ever made? Happy

301
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,420
birthday. Happy birthday. I've got it already. Happy birthday. It's the most important. It's

302
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,019
the number one. It's the number one most important song. It's the number one song.

303
00:49:21,019 --> 00:49:30,570
Can you imagine a world without happy birthday? Happy birthday is the most important piece of

304
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:47,380
music ever released. Actually, think about it. That song sucks. But it... Even if you think it

305
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:56,539
sucks, it's still... It's probably the most important song to ever have been made. It's...

306
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:03,320
What other piece of media... Oh, yeah. Hold on a minute. You're telling me that happy birthday is

307
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:10,820
not the number one single most important piece of media ever released musically. Let's talk about

308
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:21,500
this. Right now. Right now. Listen to me. Right now. There are probably... This is being sung

309
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,690
right now in probably hundreds of thousands of locations. At this very second right now,

310
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,920
right now, someone's singing it right now. There's a birthday party going on right now

311
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:38,309
somewhere in the world, and it's being sung right now. Probably thousands of them.

312
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:47,429
How many places right now is Beethoven's Fifth Symphony playing? Maybe in a dentist office

313
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:58,659
somewhere. How many dentist offices are open right now? I think there's more birthdays right

314
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:25,980
now than dentist office currently in operating hours. I think a happy birthday has a beat.

315
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,530
I'm telling you, this is being played in like a million locations. Let's think about this.

316
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:37,579
Honestly, I'm fucking a little hyped up about this, but seriously, it's Christmas time right now.

317
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:45,659
I still think happy birthday is being sung in more locations right now than Christmas music

318
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:54,019
being played in malls right now. I think so. All right. Do a poll. I want one of the malls to do a

319
00:51:54,019 --> 00:52:00,949
poll. Is it your birthday today? Is it... There's 20,000 people here. How many people's birthdays?

320
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:07,400
Be honest, please. Or I'll ban you. Is it your birthday right now? I've seen every single... Are

321
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,239
you kidding me? Every single stream I look over here, and every 10 seconds, hey dude, it's my

322
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:22,579
birthday today. How many... Is it your birthday right now? Whose birthday is it today? All right.

323
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:29,139
Let's assume that even half these people are lying. Let's assume that even 90% of these people are

324
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:41,769
lying. If it's even 1%. And then follow up question to this. Did you sing happy birthday today

325
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:46,599
at some point? And how many people were in the room? Because you got probably five different

326
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,409
locations where it was coming out. So that is an audio equipment. That's a piece of audio equipment.

327
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:57,690
If there's 50 people in a room, that is 50 pieces of 50 different places it's coming out from.

328
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:07,610
It's in the millions every day. It's the most important piece of music ever released.

329
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:18,409
Okay, yeah. So it's a lot of people. It's at least 100 people here every day. There's other

330
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:30,380
songs in non-English countries. It's probably A, B, C, D. Wait, hold on. There's other songs?

331
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:44,409
That's right. But wait, hold on. But hold on. We're just talking in like North America.

332
00:53:44,409 --> 00:53:50,780
It's important. Just wait. It's not important. It's prevalent. I don't know. I think at some point

333
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,250
extreme prevalence gets to importance, right? If there are a million people right now singing

334
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:05,289
Happy Birthday, it's a fairly important song. A, B, C's. Okay, how many people right now? Who cares?

335
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:15,110
We're wasting valuable percentage time on this. It's literally the same song.

336
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:23,989
What point is he trying to make? The point is that I think Happy Birthday is number one most

337
00:54:23,989 --> 00:54:29,940
important piece of music ever. And I'm being yelled at because people are saying it's A, B, C.

338
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,679
But then we're also talking about not North America. I mean just in North America.

339
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:44,389
Is A, B, C the same song? No, it's not. A, B, C, D. Is it Happy Birthday?

340
00:54:48,980 --> 00:55:00,980
This is not even the right- what? This is it. A, B, C. This is not it.

341
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:21,000
Birthday. It's Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. You had it wrong. Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star

342
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:28,300
could be up there too because a lot of, you know, oh, it's nap time. Twinkle, Twi- Is that happening

343
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:34,329
more than Happy Birthday? You know the point I'm making and it's in a weird way but you get it.

344
00:55:34,329 --> 00:55:38,489
You all know what is happening right now. Don't give me the question marks. You all get it. You

345
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:42,730
all know what's happening right now. I'm not hearing the question marks. I can't hear them.

346
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:52,650
I'm not- I'm not gonna listen to them. They're all the same song. We don't live in the fucking

347
00:55:52,650 --> 00:56:04,980
40s. This is so many chatters first comb stream and it shows. I haven't done one of these in a

348
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,059
long time where I just put the cam up and just do nothing and just talk at nothing. That's what

349
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:21,079
these are. Just because waiters are forced to sing it at an outback doesn't mean it's important.

350
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:27,239
Dude, come on. It- But what about the person's birthday that's at the outback right now? That's

351
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:31,400
not important to you? Well, I mean, I know you probably don't give a shit because you don't know

352
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:37,179
this person but that- you don't think that's important in the- in the social scheme of the

353
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:46,820
world? That it's not important to that person? No. Fuck them. Fuck that guy. Holy shit, you guys

354
00:56:46,820 --> 00:57:03,769
are mean. No, fuck that guy. Birthdays happen without the song. I'm- I hate getting sung to

355
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:16,619
at restaurants. It's so embarrassing. Who cares about birthday Bob? Well, guess what? When it's

356
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:21,659
your birthday and you're at a restaurant and somebody comes over and is singing to you and

357
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:27,369
all of a sudden you hear, fuck that guy. Who gives a shit about that guy? Why is that guy so important?

358
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:35,380
Fuck him. Like, sorry, it's not your birthday today other guy here. Like, relax. Why would you

359
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,699
get mad at somebody else having a birthday? Can I be really honest with this chat right now?

360
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:43,980
Are you upset at somebody else having a birthday? You're gonna get one too.

361
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:53,159
Fuck that guy. Fuck his birthday. What? He's having a birthday party. You don't- you- what are you-

362
00:57:53,159 --> 00:58:03,400
you mad at a guy having a birthday party? I'm not a negative Nancy. Okay, everybody does the same

363
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,750
thing at when this happens. Okay, you're at a restaurant. You're sitting across or you're

364
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,989
with some group and you're talking, oh yeah, and this is what everybody does. And it's fine. And

365
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:16,550
whatever. Your camera quality is ass. It's never changing. I don't care. I'm gonna actually make it

366
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:24,440
worse the more that I hear complaints. So, um, you just messed up my train of thought. What was it?

367
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:32,710
Twinkle, twinkle little star, happy birthday to you. Number one song. It's 500- top 500 songs.

368
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,389
What's the top 500? Number one. We're at a restaurant now. Okay, the restaurant. Oh, okay.

369
00:58:36,389 --> 00:58:40,550
So, we're sitting at the restaurant and there's only one minute left. We're still live. Don't

370
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:45,510
worry. So, we're sitting at the restaurant and I'm sitting across. Everybody does the same exact

371
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:52,889
thing. You start going, yeah, yeah, I mean, the DLC is going to be kind of fun. What's, um, what,

372
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:57,690
you have, uh, you have a couple kids now, don't you? And then, happy birthday to you. And everyone

373
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:16,250
goes. And then you just go, hey. So, I mean, the DLC is going to be kind of fun. What a big deal.

374
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:24,969
Oh, no. You had interrupted for 10 seconds. They get to have a birthday party. It's time. It's not

375
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:34,010
time. It's time when I, I'll leave when I want to leave. Why did you grunt it instead of singing it?

376
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:40,760
Because I had to show you the emotional impact of when you're sitting there and it happens.

377
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:47,289
Bye, Jerma. Before everybody leaves, because I know some of you, I know, but I know this community

378
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:50,489
very well. Three or four thousand of you are going to leave for a joke and it's funny.

379
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:58,119
The top 500 jokes ever made, I think. I don't think it makes the top 500.

380
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:06,730
But, yeah. So, very important stuff. 17th, 4 p.m. The Holiday Extravaganza. I'm actually

381
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:10,650
very excited for it. A lot of work has gone into this. It's going to be a big, fun fucking event.

382
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:15,050
The awards are going to happen there. Got a ton of fun activities planned.

383
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:24,380
You'll see when you see it. I'm so excited for it. 17th. 17th. The 17th is a Saturday. This

384
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:31,349
Saturday, 4 p.m. Pacific. Also, vote on the poll if you haven't, if you really want to. And you're

385
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:36,150
like, wait, there's a poll? There is. There's like a million questions to answer. If you don't want

386
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,269
to do it, you don't have to, but if you want to, go ahead and vote for your favorite and least

387
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:44,579
favorite things of the year. That's what we do every year here. No, we're not doing it on New

388
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:58,710
Year's Eve anymore. When does the poll close? The poll is going to close in the next 48 hours.

389
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:07,030
You understand? Does that mean Battleaxe is delayed? I just made that up, but somebody

390
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:12,550
said something similar to that and I just changed it. Battleaxe is going to happen

391
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:24,869
a little bit later on next year. Early next year. Fog is coming. No, I'm good. We're good.

392
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:37,400
I told you one to two hours. I didn't say one hour even. Nice bong hit voice. Exclamation point

393
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:44,099
awards if you want to see it pop up in the chat. Also, make sure that you type in exclamation point

394
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:50,260
awards to find yourself going up against a cool poll. It's there and it's exciting and it's ready

395
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:57,780
to go. Also, make sure to tune in on the 17th at 4 p.m. Tons of activities, potential things that

396
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:15,960
are fun and let's get to it. All right, let's go. Scripted Sally. Yeah, you got another couple days.

397
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:31,269
That's my favorite news broadcast. Hey, thanks. We got a lot of, no, I'm not going to say anything

398
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:41,590
because I know what happens if I say something. I'm just kind of reading now. I'm just reading

399
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:48,409
the chat. I'm just sitting here going, add a laugh track to your streams. I think we did that a while

400
01:02:48,409 --> 01:03:03,289
back. It was funny for a little bit. When are you going to do more Breath of the Wild? I don't know.

401
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:09,340
At some point after the holidays. There's been a lot of stuff going on. Tons of, I feel like I've

402
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:14,440
been, the last few months especially, I've just kind of been like back and forth, back and forth,

403
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:20,519
doing all kinds of stuff, moving all over the place. Tons of meetings and, oh meeting Andy,

404
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:27,000
business Andy. I know, but still like it's been, there's been a lot going on. So after the holidays,

405
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:37,750
we'll get back to it. What did you say? Are you going to play Frog Detective 3?

406
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,829
I was going to play Frog Detective 3 last week, but I just didn't have time for it.

407
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:46,650
Something else had to take its place. He's very sassy today. I think I'm just excited.

408
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:58,230
Every time we do the awards, it's exciting. I don't know. It's just fun. It's just, it's just,

409
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:01,590
it's going to be like a fun time. I just, that's what I know because it always is.

410
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:10,070
So it's fun to get excited about stuff. Sorry, I'm getting excited about stuff.

411
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:14,920
Your hair looks weird. I mean, oh, that's probably why.

412
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:28,489
Can you please punch the hole through your drywall? Why would I do that? I would like,

413
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:37,110
I want to know one reason for me to do that. Like why would I do that? Because it'd be funny.

414
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:41,530
Would it though? Like would that, would that be funny to you? I mean maybe, but then there's

415
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:49,239
just a hole in my wall and I have to deal with it. I don't want a hole in my wall. Find out what's

416
01:04:49,239 --> 01:05:11,960
behind it. It's dust and insulation. Go wash your hair. My hair is clean. It's just this,

417
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:19,670
hold on, let me see. It's this piece here that people get so upset about. It's this thing right

418
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:28,329
here. What if I just turn this room on next and this was just shaved off, gone? No, I like it and

419
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:42,710
it's staying. So that's what's staying. Shave your head. I, you know what? I'm actually terrified.

420
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:50,739
I am terrified of eventually when I have to have a bald head if it ever happens,

421
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:56,820
I try to get enough sleep. I try to drink, you know, green tea. Green tea is really good for your

422
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:03,380
hair. If you didn't know, green tea is a, it has a compound in it that's really, it's good for your

423
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:11,059
scalp and it's good for your hair growing and maintaining. It's good for you. And when this

424
01:06:11,059 --> 01:06:18,739
goes, I'm going to look fucking weird. I'm going to look strange with a bald head if I ever have

425
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:33,980
to have a bald head. I hope it never happens. Herbal remedy, Andy. Green tea is good for you.

426
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:46,469
I'm pretty sure that that's been the case for the last few thousand years. I think,

427
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:55,579
what do you mean herbal remedy, Andy? Green, I didn't tell you. I just said green tea is good

428
01:06:55,579 --> 01:07:02,820
for you, which it is. If I told you to eat an apple today, would you go, oh yeah,

429
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:09,960
apple remedy, Andy. Apples are good for you. They're just, they're, they're a fruit and they

430
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:21,059
are a good part of a diet that, a balanced diet. He's selling us essential oils. I've said Andy

431
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:33,019
a lot today. You notice that? I would do anything you tell me. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.

432
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:43,750
Okay. Really? Okay. Make sure you drink enough water. Make sure you drink enough water. Make

433
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:51,860
sure you get enough sleep. Try to incorporate some more, um, active activities in your life.

434
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:56,179
I'm not talking like, you know, go work out of the gym every single day. You know,

435
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:59,619
every so often take a walk, right? Just take a walk, get yourself active, drink a little bit

436
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:13,769
more water. Um, try to get more sleep if you can. There you go. Yeah. Let's do it. I'll do

437
01:08:13,769 --> 01:08:21,399
anything except those things specifically. Okay. Fine. Um, hey, here you go. If you haven't been in

438
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:26,119
a while, go get a, go get a checkup with the doctor, right? Just go check, just go get physical.

439
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:32,970
How am I doing? How, how's it going here? How's my body doing? Go, go get a physical. Go to the

440
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:39,369
dentist. Go check on your, maybe go check and see how things are going up there, right? No, I can't

441
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:56,380
do that. No, I won't do that either. Okay. Um, start moisturizing your face. Start moisturizing

442
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:01,239
your face. Just a little bit out of the shower and just like here. Let me show you where we do

443
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:06,359
it. Nothing, nothing with a bunch of junk in it, right? Just a nice quality. You don't have to

444
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:11,979
spend that much money on this stuff. And it's just face moisturizer, especially with those people in

445
01:09:11,979 --> 01:09:17,819
a dry environment. It's just a little bit. You don't need much. Nice circles here, here, down the

446
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:34,460
nose, on the chin, down the neck. Moisturize. Okay. No, I'm not doing that either. I'm not, I don't do

447
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:46,199
that. I'll do anything but that too. What's my morning routine? It's actually pretty simple.

448
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:57,239
Are you ready? This is not medical advice. This is very, just what I personally do. But what I'm

449
01:09:57,239 --> 01:10:05,020
going to tell you is not medical advice anyways. I get up in the morning, whatever that is, and I

450
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:12,659
grab my phone. It's usually kind of, it's usually next to me here. I grab my phone with one eye open

451
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:19,380
and I go, I just kind of scroll for about 10 minutes. Eventually I open the other eye and

452
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:25,079
everything is blurry and it sucks. It's like I'm seeing double vision because I had this eye closed

453
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:30,279
for too long because I'm kind of just like still half asleep. So I let that, you know, you don't

454
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:37,130
don't do that shit. It's like kind of sucks. Eventually I get awake. I get out of bed. I go

455
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:48,649
downstairs. I get my robe on. I tie it down. I then get in my elevator and I go up four or five

456
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:57,050
floors and I go to my coffee station. And then once I get up there, I obviously thank the other

457
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:08,039
people that are, I couldn't keep going with it. I couldn't, I tried. It was just too much.

458
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:11,159
Anyway, I was going to talk about like, I have like, yeah, like a Scrooge McDuck house.

459
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:26,659
No, I wake up, I drink coffee. After I drink coffee, I have to, I always try to drink,

460
01:11:26,659 --> 01:11:33,340
I drink coffee. Listen, I, you go to the bathroom room every morning. If I don't drink my morning

461
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:41,140
coffee, I, it's over. The whole day is ruined. Everything is ruined. Not because, oh, I need my

462
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:47,109
morning coffee because I don't, I need to wake up. No, that's not what it's for. My morning coffee

463
01:11:47,109 --> 01:11:57,939
has nothing to do with caffeine. Nothing. Zero. It's only to make sure that I can take a shit

464
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:04,819
because it's nothing worse than starting your day and you get halfway through the day and you still

465
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:13,659
haven't, it hasn't happened yet and it ruins the entire day. I cannot operate until I have my

466
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:23,210
morning coffee shit. It's every day. If I do not have that routine, the day is ruined. Ruined. I

467
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:30,060
have gone to places before, some events, some things, some, you know, family get togethers where,

468
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:35,159
all right, we're meeting up at this place. So we're doing this at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.

469
01:12:35,159 --> 01:12:43,560
and where's my coffee? I need coffee. I need my coffee in the morning and I have to wait until it

470
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:53,659
happens. So, oh, it's a big deal. So you, I drink my morning coffee. I go to the bathroom and then

471
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:58,939
I'm ready to start the day. Then I take, I take a shower, you know, quick shower. Doesn't need to be

472
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:05,500
too long. Just enough to, you know, wash my hair, put a little conditioner in, clean off. And then

473
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:10,119
after, it's because you're addicted to caffeine. I don't, I don't care whatever you're saying. I'm

474
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:17,380
just telling you, it's, this has been like 20 straight years, okay? People, the viewers are

475
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:26,300
leaving. I don't, whatever. So I end up, after I have my coffee, after I have my morning coffee

476
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:36,470
shit, I take a shower. I get out, dry off. I moisturize after it's dry. After my armpits are dry, I

477
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:59,619
put on some deodorant and then I put some clothes on and let's go. End the stream now. Shut off.

478
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:19,609
How's that sound? How's that sound? You do a cheese tier list. That's the highlight. I'm sassy. I am

479
01:14:19,609 --> 01:14:33,289
not sassy. You, okay. Nope. I ain't taking this today. You can't say, you, all right, if you,

480
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:40,810
if you just, hey, end the stream. End the stream, loser. Hey, how about you shut up?

481
01:14:43,909 --> 01:14:49,460
What did you, hey, what did you say to me? Hey, that's not a lot. Hey, that's not fair.

482
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:58,140
Everybody get him. That's not how it works. You can't yell at me and then I, and I respond to

483
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:06,149
you yelling and it's like, hey, you, what did you say to me? It's like, oh, hey, I'm just walking

484
01:15:06,149 --> 01:15:14,359
down the street and somebody like, oh, what the? And they go, yeah. And then I grab them and they

485
01:15:14,359 --> 01:15:19,399
go, hey, hey, what's happening? Look over me. Hey, don't, no, hey, I don't want any trouble with you.

486
01:15:20,659 --> 01:15:38,699
Excuse me? Uh-huh. What are you talking about? GTA NPC? What do you mean 1950s NPC? What does

487
01:15:38,699 --> 01:16:00,010
that even mean? GTA NPC? NPC interaction. What do these mean? He's inventing scenarios. No,

488
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:05,539
I'm just telling you, I'm making a point that if somebody, he likes, if somebody screams at you,

489
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,939
okay, let me, well, you didn't scream, but he's still like, you said a comment then I'm replying

490
01:16:09,939 --> 01:16:18,699
to it. All right. So it's like, you ready? Here we go. This is, this is what you like me to do.

491
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:32,699
Fuck you. Dork. Eat shit. Loser. Fuck you. Dork. Eat shit. Fuck you. Loser. Dork. Eat shit. Loser.

492
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:53,819
Dork. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Hip squeak is better. Hit dork one more time. Okay. Eat shit.

493
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:59,479
That's not it. Loser. Fuck you. The one that I deleted. I don't have it anymore. Hold on.

494
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:05,609
This is what? This guy's going off the deep end. I'm, I'm proving a point. You never even

495
01:17:05,609 --> 01:17:11,880
do a column stream before, whatever. In GTA, the NPCs will sometimes randomly insult you.

496
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,279
And in the newer games, you can insult back, but it just makes the NPCs fight you.

497
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:27,460
That's true. I forgot about that. That's actually funny. Yeah. It's like, hey, get away from me,

498
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:44,069
you fucking loser. Hey, fuck you. What's that? You should stop swearing. I actually had this

499
01:17:44,069 --> 01:17:49,590
conversation with myself recently. I'm not kidding. I, I, I want to stop. I want to bring my

500
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:57,289
swear words down. I say too many swear words, I think. I'm a, I swear and I want to do a little

501
01:17:57,289 --> 01:18:01,050
less swearing, but it's never going to happen. I say this every year. It's my new year's resolution.

502
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:26,090
You have a potty mouth. It's your only redeeming quality that I swear. Weird. I remember in GTA 5,

503
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:30,409
I would just be standing and for some reason that made an NPC get pissed off and fight me.

504
01:18:30,409 --> 01:18:37,140
Oh yeah. If there's like a, an NPC just standing there and you stand like here, sometimes they'll

505
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:58,260
just go and they'll just come after you. What did you say? You look what? Your room looks like

506
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:20,970
a liminal space. Your room looks like a Gmod map. What are you talking about? You look like you're

507
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:26,119
in front of a green screen. I can't believe there was a dick over here earlier. I cannot believe

508
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:42,890
that. It was bad. That was, that was something. Well, not, it was, it was your first commentary.

509
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:48,920
I'm okay. No, that doesn't mean nothing. It's just that over, you weren't here earlier is what I

510
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:55,130
should have said. You weren't here earlier, which is what I should have just said, but it's not what

511
01:19:55,130 --> 01:20:02,279
I said. There was a dick over here. A fake one and not, no, there was a, somebody explain it please

512
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:08,229
before I look, I'm going crazy. Can somebody help me please? Somebody help me here. I need,

513
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:12,069
somebody help me in a mod or somebody in chat. Clear the chat. Clear the chat and somebody

514
01:20:12,069 --> 01:20:18,489
explain it. A light was on there up here and it was in the shape of a whatever. Somebody help me.

515
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:51,079
No hell. Look into liminal spaces. So, I think that's it. It looks like you're in front of a

516
01:20:51,079 --> 01:21:01,399
green screen. It's just cause, I don't know, it's like a shitty lit room. Can you raise an eyebrow

517
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:08,180
and stare into the camera? No, I don't feel like it. All right. We are at, and this is only going

518
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:12,100
to be a show. I just wanted to come in, come over here and just hype up the holiday stream.

519
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:16,649
This weekend, again, vote on the poll. And wait, wait, there's other important stuff that I forgot

520
01:21:16,649 --> 01:21:28,739
to talk about. Hold on. How quickly can I get through some of these? I'll talk about it later

521
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:40,869
because I got some stuff I have to take care of. Please sing the Family Guy theme before you leave.

522
01:21:40,869 --> 01:21:53,340
No. Oh, okay. Grotto Beasts. Grotto Beasts. If we can get a link, it's coming soon. It's coming

523
01:21:53,340 --> 01:22:03,029
very soon. Grotto Beasts is almost upon us. Keep an eye on the Twitter. Grotto Beasts are being

524
01:22:03,029 --> 01:22:09,220
teased on Twitter every so often. If you want to see some of the characters that are in this game,

525
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:17,079
it's a full trading card game, by the way. Go check it out. Grotto Beasts. Grotto Beasts. What

526
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:23,079
else should I do? Because I know I'm not going to be around for a while before the stream. What

527
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:25,720
else? Something else. There's got to be something else I can talk about for the next two seconds.

528
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:34,539
Oh, vote on the poll. The end of the year awards. It's not, a lot of people think it's just,

529
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:45,689
dude, the yonkies plonky. Holy shit. What does this mean? What is this? What is this?

530
01:22:45,689 --> 01:23:22,899
That's so sweet. I loved that every second of it. Wow. Oh my goodness. I don't even know what to

531
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:34,199
say. That was like really cool. I'm going to cry. No. That's Tom Kenny, by the way. Voice of Spongebob.

532
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:38,680
Probably. All right. You want to do like, you want to do top 500 of voice actors to ever live?

533
01:23:39,479 --> 01:23:46,409
Uh, that's close to one. Very close. Very close to number one. That's in the top 10 at least.

534
01:23:46,409 --> 01:24:09,609
Tom Kenny. Absolute legend. What else? I wonder what that list would look like.

535
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:22,390
There's a lot of people that could be on that list. All right. All right. Well, okay. The awards.

536
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:27,109
December 17th. Keep an eye on the Twitter. There's going to be a big tweet. There's going to be a big

537
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:36,649
tweet. Marketing Andy coming through here. Big tweet coming in this afternoon, this evening.

538
01:24:36,649 --> 01:24:43,819
Awards this weekend. Vote on the poll if you haven't. 27 categories. Tons of activities.

539
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:56,500
An entire extravaganza. All evening. 4 p.m. Pacific. This weekend. Right here. Right here.

540
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,550
All right. Bye. See you this weekend, guys. Seriously, thanks for watching. I didn't even

541
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:04,869
talk about the chest. What happened? I didn't talk about chest boxing. That was one of the

542
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:10,229
most unbelievable experiences of my entire life. I didn't even talk about it. I said one comment

543
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:18,380
about how my hair was electrified. Shit. Oh my god. I was going to talk about a whole thing.

544
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:23,779
All right. Let me do it. I got a little bit of time. Let me go through this really quickly.

545
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:32,859
There was a period. The event was unbelievable, first of all, right? Ludwig. Just absolutely

546
01:25:32,859 --> 01:25:37,670
legendary status. When he's like, hey, do you want to do this? Do you want to come on and do

547
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:43,590
that? It's just like, of course I do. Dude, of course I fucking do. So much fun. The air in that

548
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:48,390
arena was just so... The energy was awesome. It was an unbelievable time. But something else

549
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:55,100
that happened that it was... I don't know. I just want to say it very quickly. After the event,

550
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,859
it was over and people were kind of leaving. There was a lot of people that came up to me

551
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:04,409
after the event and were like, hey, can you sign this? Can we take a picture or whatever?

552
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:10,090
And it was a lot of people. And there may have been some people that I missed just because

553
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:14,409
people had to get kind of trickled out and everything. And there were lots and lots of

554
01:26:14,409 --> 01:26:17,770
people. So I just want to say to those of you that came up to me and saying like, hey,

555
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:23,750
thanks for the streams and stuff. I don't even know what to say. It was an incredible experience.

556
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:30,090
I just hope that you enjoyed it, which it seems like a lot of people did, which is that makes me

557
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:35,880
feel good because that means that people liked the show because that's really all I care about

558
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:42,569
at the end of the day is, did people enjoy what I did? I hope they do. That goes through my mind

559
01:26:42,569 --> 01:26:47,779
every single time. Whenever I'm sitting there, and I told you this before the baseball show too,

560
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,619
when the first strike call came in, I was like, I fucking hope this is fun. I really do.

561
01:26:51,619 --> 01:26:56,890
Hope the Christmas stream is really fun too, which I think it would be. So for those of you

562
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:00,569
that didn't, there was a lot of people that they were making leave because they were like,

563
01:27:00,569 --> 01:27:06,020
everyone's got to go, everyone's got to go. I appreciate it. Hopefully I could wave to some

564
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:12,199
of you. There were hundreds and hundreds of people there in the audience. So I don't know,

565
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:17,979
I think there was a few thousand because of the seats. So thanks for showing up. Ludwig obviously

566
01:27:17,979 --> 01:27:25,140
appreciates it. He put on an unbelievable hell of an event. And then obviously JK Productions,

567
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:37,779
which, hey, look at that. Community Jake. It's really just cool to see that just shit that me

568
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:46,649
and Jake five years ago doing the carnival shit and fucking around and look at the space now.

569
01:27:46,649 --> 01:27:51,989
Look at what Jake is doing now. He's done so many cool fucking things with so many awesome streamers

570
01:27:51,989 --> 01:27:57,220
and not just Jake, not just Jake's company, the other companies too. There's other production

571
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:03,670
companies that are coming up here and doing all kinds of awesome stuff. It's awesome. I love to

572
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:13,670
see it and I am happy to participate. Seriously. And you'll see this weekend some other fun stuff.

573
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:21,420
Okay. All right. I said, there you go. There's like in a nutshell, it was an unbelievable

574
01:28:21,420 --> 01:28:39,850
experience. I'll never forget it. Okay. I'll see you on Saturday. Saturday, 4 PM. Can I get a quick

575
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:53,079
let's go before I go? Before I go. All right. There you go. I don't think I'm really going to

576
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:58,250
do an outro. Actually, why not? We're here. Thanks for sticking around. This is a quick one

577
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:13,289
before we do the big holiday stream. 4 PM Pacific time. There'll be a tweet too. You'll see it. I

578
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:36,229
think people are going to like the image that goes with it. Stop demanding stuff from us.

579
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:41,260
And then I will say, cause I don't know if I'll have time to say it at the end of that stream,

580
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,859
but after the Christmas stream, after the big holiday extravaganza,

581
01:29:47,399 --> 01:29:53,699
I will be taking a break for the holidays. So you'll see me again into the new year.

582
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:04,890
There will probably be an opportunity at some point the week after before Christmas time for

583
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:12,489
me to do a couple of streams possibly. So we'll see. We'll come back in the new year if not,

584
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:20,659
but I imagine there'll be another couple of streams before the end of the year.

585
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:32,470
Holiday break Andy. Will you please play God of War Ragnarok?

586
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:52,779
Um, I don't know. Maybe, but I, I, let me end on this. Uh, stuff like the chest boxing thing

587
01:30:52,779 --> 01:30:59,479
makes me realize a lot of times that I'm in a position that's incredibly fortunate and

588
01:30:59,479 --> 01:31:07,739
sometimes a little overwhelming. And I'm just, I just really hope that you guys can continue

589
01:31:07,739 --> 01:31:12,659
to have fun here. That's all I care about. And sometimes it can be a little overwhelming, but

590
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:19,140
thanks for being here and thanks for watching. Thanks for being around as long as a lot of you

591
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:28,699
have. Um, I, that's pretty much, I, it's hard for me to kind of put into words some of this stuff,

592
01:31:28,699 --> 01:31:36,180
but especially after that event, it was just like, holy shit, that was fun. And that was cool.

593
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:44,409
But it makes me think a lot like that to be in that spot, to actually be able to do that.

594
01:31:44,409 --> 01:31:49,340
I'm very lucky. I have a lot of fucking people over the course of my life here that have supported

595
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:55,140
me and a lot of other streamers that have shown a lot of support and a lot of everybody here too.

596
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:01,909
And I just, I just don't know what to say besides thank you. It's, it's been a, it's been a ride.

597
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:13,000
Um, and I don't know how to put it into words besides that. So I appreciate it.

598
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:28,069
I'll see you guys on Saturday. Goodbye. See you soon. Saturday at 4 p.m. Pacific.

599
01:32:28,069 --> 01:32:44,489
All right. Bye. Yeah. And call your mother.
