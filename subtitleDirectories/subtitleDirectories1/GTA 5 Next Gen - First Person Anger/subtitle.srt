1
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:10,970
Tennessee Boulevard. There's somebody eating strawberries in Tennessee Boulevard.

2
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:22,780
You know, known as the fruit bandit. We've seen this guy. No, no, wait, wait a second. Wait,

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:29,769
what the fuck is happening right now? What kind of car is this? What kind of fucking car?

4
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,270
I didn't even come pick up the trash on my sidewalk. Fucking trash company. That's what I think about

5
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,469
you. I don't want these boxes. Who put these boxes here? I don't like these boxes. $1.99 for

6
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,469
a slice of pizza. That's a fucking rip off. It should be two cents. We got chairs that don't

7
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,789
match my tie. Get out of here, orange. Fucking bullshit. What's this? Stainless steel? Yeah,

8
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,429
that's a fucking clock of shit too. What's this chair? Sale. Oh, we got a sale going on now.

9
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:04,780
Was I not supposed to punch that guy in the face? I was not. Sale? Oh, we got a sale going on now.

10
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,340
Sales are stupid. Gas companies? Gas companies are always trying to rip us off. They're always

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,659
$5 a gallon now. When are we going to get solar powered cars? That's what I'm talking about.

12
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,019
When are we going to get nuclear powered?

13
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:27,670
A beer. And I'll explain how the world really works. Who gives you the slip?

14
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,709
A car dealer, dog. By the name of Simeon Yattery.

15
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,260
By the name of Simeon Yattery. So this businessman, he look legit to you?

16
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,219
Fucker.

17
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,019
Well, is this overpass going to kill me? Let's see. Place your bets.

18
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:57,299
Is this going to instantly kill me or am I going to get under it? Nope. I'm dead.

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,780
Guys, this guy just had a problem from the very second I saw him.

20
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:12,340
Nice punch. Let me show you how it's done. The first person punching is just ridiculous.

21
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,490
Will you get out of here? You're going to get run over.

22
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,879
Don't ever take your eyes off the fight. That was your first mistake.

23
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,340
Actually, that was like your 10th mistake. Not entirely sure what you've done

24
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,340
to get this to happen, Franklin. There's no stars. So that's not what's going on here.

25
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,659
There's a cop that is just an absolute psychopath over here. I'm not sure what he's doing.

26
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:43,500
Yep. This makes complete sense. First thing I want to ask is, number one, why is this happening?

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,289
And number two, why is Franklin still alive? He's just this guy's shooting with a shotgun

28
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,020
over and over again. And he's just like standing here completely fine.

29
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,180
Is this guy shooting like funny bullets at him? Like, I don't get it.

30
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:08,099
He's like, taking cover. I'm going to take cover around the corner. What are you doing?

31
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,219
He shot him like 12 times. Franklin's not even doing it. Oh, I've got to dive over the bush.

32
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:25,719
We've got to get out of here. This is still happening. Is this guy going to run out of bullets?

33
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:33,539
Hey, everybody. It's Mr. Sneak Man. This episode of Mr. Sneak Man's movie is Mr. Sneak Man holds

34
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,699
middle finger out the window and it's not real sneaky at all, now is it?
