1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:06,230
Yeah, let's play House of the Dead. That was Dinosaur Fossil Hunter, and it was a really interesting game. It was really cool.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:14,660
But I want to play, I want to like, shoot the zombies right now. NA infrastructure, Omega LoL.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:22,019
Um, Nevada, Las Vegas is like, one of the top five in the country for infrastructure, so excuse me, take that back please.

4
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,260
Nevada, like, honestly is like, number three in infrastructure in the whole country.

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,460
I just, just, I mean, I have to correct people when they say something incorrect.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:40,420
Alright, House of the Dead. Do I play this with a mouse? It's just a mouse aiming game?

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:53,829
So this is a House of the Dead remake. Hopefully it's not loud. Please don't be loud. Please don't be loud. I turned it down, but please don't be loud.

8
00:00:53,829 --> 00:01:18,230
Okay, here it comes. I need a game capture, new capture. Let's go, where is it? Right here.

9
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:35,819
Don't, there it is. Okay, why's my camera all laggy now?

10
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:46,090
Uh, the wind. This game does not want to be captured. What the fuck is happening? Watch out for...

11
00:01:48,379 --> 00:02:01,739
What is going on? Okay, I think we're alright. What the fuck just happened?

12
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:13,819
Options. Game, is this the, did I open the right ga-? Hello? Who's there? Oh!

13
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:34,599
Um, shadow quality medium? That was very jarring. Okay, so display. Huge scale. Um, hide the HUD.

14
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:45,129
Brightness, I don't know, here. Quality, what, what frame rate is this at? Gameplay. Use vibrations.

15
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:55,210
No. No. AMO on crosshair? No. Like, maybe? No, that's ugly. Automatic reload. Quiet!

16
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:02,819
Automatic reload. Aim assist medium? I don't know what that means. What should my player color be?

17
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:18,340
Outside thickness. Crosshair speed? I don't know. Sound. Alright, I think I'm ready.

18
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:26,280
Keyboard, mouse, sensitivity. Turn it down. Alright, let's go. Let's go!

19
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,580
Welcome in the House of the Dead remake. There are many ways to play the game, so make sure you

20
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,460
review all options and create a session that suits you best. Okay, got it. Original. Okay,

21
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,659
difficulty normal. Classic mode. Multiplayer mode. I don't want to play fucking multiplayer.

22
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:56,330
Alright, this one. Chapter one. Tragedy. Just, I just shoot the fucking zombies. I bet you can't

23
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:12,729
name a field of research this is based off of. The morgue? Alright, let's go! Uh, can one of the

24
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:40,899
mods change the game? Jesus Christ. Nice. Alright, let's go. House of the Dead. Sensitivity's not

25
00:04:40,899 --> 00:05:01,160
bad. I might need a little bit higher. How do I reload? How do you reload? R? R. Oh, fuck you.

26
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:10,810
Is the calibration wrong? Yeah, guys, I'm holding up the gun like this and this is where the gun is

27
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,620
aiming and here is where it is on the screen. God, these old machines are such pieces of shit.

28
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:25,990
Turn aim assist off. Okay. That always sucked the most. Every time that you went with like the

29
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,339
two or three of your friends and there was like a time crisis or like House of the Dead

30
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:36,100
and you were the sorry motherfucker that got the one that had like seven inches of wrong calibration.

31
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,660
It was such a pain because you had to cost money. You had to spend 50 cents for a life to do that.

32
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:49,240
That's not fair. Alright, turn off. Turn this off. Yeah, I don't need, I don't want that.

33
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,180
Alright, let's go. I think sensitivity needs to be a little bit higher.

34
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,939
Before my whole, before my house blows down. Okay. Like, honest to God, I'm like, I feel like,

35
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:09,800
I feel like the zombies are coming for me right now. I feel like I'm pretty good at this.

36
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:39,269
This music. Does the game feel like it's in times two speed for anybody else?

37
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:28,519
Got it. Extra health, right? Nice. I wish I had a light gun right now. Whoa, close. Got it. Frog.

38
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:55,180
Jesus. I feel like I bought extra coffee. Shit. I feel like I drank too much coffee.

39
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,699
Did I have way too much coffee? Everything feels like it's a hundred miles per hour. I

40
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:14,579
drank way too much coffee. No, I got to shoot that bug. Oh no, I just got the Giga Chad.

41
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:30,970
What? I freaked out. Why did I do that? Why did I do that? I sat there for so long.

42
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:39,220
And I like knew what was happening. I was in slow motion. The only part that was in slow motion

43
00:08:39,220 --> 00:09:23,799
was what just happened. Now give me some health. Got it. Ah, fuck you. I'm going to die. There's

44
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:53,320
like skin all over my mouth. Skin all over my mouth. We're good. Who's this? Holy Jesus.

45
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,330
Carry type weak point in the chest.

46
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,279
I got him. I did it. That was insane.

47
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,899
Why would I take a picture? Why did I take a pic? Oh, these are all the people that are left alive.

48
00:10:52,899 --> 00:11:02,340
Okay. All right. Not bad. This hidden treasure somewhere in this area.

49
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:37,899
Second chapter. All right. Stop panic firing and just shoot down here. I got it. Excuse me.

50
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:49,110
What was that? What are you doing? How did I die? Shut the fuck up. Continue. How many credits do

51
00:11:49,110 --> 00:12:37,799
I have? 10. I got 10 coins. Hardy Kroger. Whoa. Damn it. This game's terrifying. It's too much.

52
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,549
The worst part about playing these games alone is there's not three other people in the room

53
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,750
that I can like pretend I'm playing and they can actually shoot this shit. I have to actually kill

54
00:12:47,750 --> 00:13:30,870
everything. I can't miss. I have to kill them. Got it. Give me that health. I shot him in the

55
00:13:30,870 --> 00:14:09,210
head like three times. It's bullshit. Oh, shut up. Whoa. I missed and I even pre-fired him.

56
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:49,059
Oh my goodness. Treasure chest. Oh, there's a person behind there. Thank you. Oh, I hate that.

57
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,340
In midair, you go all the way back out. That guy didn't even know what happened.

58
00:14:57,820 --> 00:16:03,129
Peace. You're welcome. What's that? Whatever. Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Nice. Oh, we're good.

59
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:38,549
Don't run in front of me. Give me a treasure chest. Oh shit. How am I supposed to fall asleep to this?

60
00:16:38,549 --> 00:17:31,400
Hi. Weak point. Top right. Okay. Let's go. I'm going to puke. I hate this. I hate to throw up.

61
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:48,890
Oh, wait. Auto reload. Five seconds? Every second?

62
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,650
Okay. Okay. I'm good. What? The title is reload?

63
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:40,579
We won't let you have it your way. I think auto reload is probably worse.

64
00:18:41,220 --> 00:19:02,440
Afraid of spiders. Oh God. Truth. Yeah. Auto reload sucks. Can I turn off the guy saying

65
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:20,920
reload? You can mute reload. Okay. You can mute reload. That's funny. Okay. Now I don't care.

66
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:52,660
Nice. Go back. No, it's, I don't want to go back. The bullets bouncing around the room a million

67
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:19,769
times. Duck, man. Get out of the way. That was pretty good. That was pretty good shot. Wait,

68
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:35,380
what? I don't, what happened? I don't get it. Whatever. I threw like a handful of change in

69
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:47,529
the dryer. Okay. That's like, this is fucking crazy. I can't even play the game. All right.

70
00:20:47,529 --> 00:21:32,920
See if I can do it. Am I winning? What happened? Oh, dead. Bring back reload. No. I don't like it.

71
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,559
Isn't there machine guns in the game? You can like click on it. It's like,

72
00:21:48,279 --> 00:22:16,779
that didn't even hit me. That's such bullshit. Oh, come on. Get out of my way here. This is a

73
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:44,819
classic game. Can you play the classic version without the updated graphics? No? Hit again. I'm

74
00:22:44,819 --> 00:23:20,700
gonna run out of coins. Say reload. Fine. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload.

75
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:43,660
That's better. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Reload. Are you happy? Reload. Reload.

76
00:23:44,539 --> 00:24:12,440
Fuck you. Who cares? I'm just going to play the game. Who cares? Watch out.

77
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:23,299
What is that weird voice? It's hard for me to even hear what I'm even saying. I'll be honest.

78
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:36,839
The voice changer is not still on. You guys are making me waste continues and I don't

79
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,720
want to fucking have to use it. I'm like, I'll fucking, fucking say swear. I'm not swearing ever

80
00:24:41,720 --> 00:25:36,819
again. Is this the last level? All right. Right in the head. That was easy. Wait, was I supposed to

81
00:25:36,819 --> 00:26:20,890
win that fast? Holy shit. That was really loud. That was scary. All right. I only have seven coins

82
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:34,250
left. You're not using a dysfunctional NES light gun. This doesn't count. I mean, okay. I have

83
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:42,650
some thoughts about this game. I'll zip. I think it's hard to make a game like this when you use

84
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:48,410
the mouse. When, I mean, the difficulty in this game comes from being able to actually aim the

85
00:26:48,410 --> 00:27:03,079
light gun. Zit? What? What are you saying? Zit? Where? Where? What are you talking about? Where?

86
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:44,119
Where? Where do you see a zit? What are you talking about? Photo mode. God damn it. Oh shit.

87
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:15,980
Shit. My arm hurts. My fucking arm hurts. My fucking hand hurts. All right. I'm good.

88
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:25,670
I don't want to fight the guy that flies, right? Do I have to? Of course I do.

89
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:47,609
Oh my god. I can shoot with the space bar. Everything has changed.

90
00:28:48,250 --> 00:29:17,640
Everything's changed. I can shoot with space bar. Ow.

91
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:58,440
Find reload to your mouse? No, man. That's not happening. Ow. I'm gonna run out of continues.

92
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,680
Zit?

93
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:39,130
I don't know. I think I could take it.

94
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:06,839
What did he drop? What happened? What happened?

95
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:32,619
Uh-oh. Unknown. Oh shit. It's Mewtwo. You gotta shoot him in the muscle tissue.

96
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:41,579
This game's giving me a headache. I actually have a headache again.

97
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:57,609
This game is so fucking loud and like the sound effects. It sounds like an animal got into a

98
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:16,519
fucking restaurant kitchen and started running around and smashing stuff. Somebody get that.

99
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,940
Somebody get that fox. Somebody get him. Somebody grab that fox.

100
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:34,380
Oh my god. I can't lose here. I got four continues. I can't fuck this up.

101
00:32:48,380 --> 00:33:03,289
Oh shit. I'm gonna lose. Fuck. No, don't lose. I'm getting weak. I'm getting weak.

102
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:26,539
Guys, I'm getting weak. One of the chefs. One of the chefs comes out of the restaurant.

103
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:32,859
Comes out of like the door of the kitchen and the fox is on his face and he's like running around

104
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:42,200
like bumping into tables and shit. Is this as loud as it is for me as it is for you?

105
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,339
Okay. No, don't fuck. I have two continues.

106
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,099
Oh, I'm getting weak. Oh, I'm slowing down. Actually, I'm slowing down.

107
00:35:49,099 --> 00:36:06,920
Okay, I win. Well, no, it's not gonna be phase two, right?

108
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:38,099
Everything is over. Nothing more must go on. Goodbye. Farewell.

109
00:36:38,099 --> 00:37:22,199
I did it. Accept. How do I accept? Accept. Tab is accept. I don't care. That was crazy.

110
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:40,019
That was just crazy. I feel like that was weird. A new chapter came out? New chapter?

111
00:37:40,019 --> 00:38:00,219
Okay, wait. New campaign. Oh, I can do horde mode. Let me try this and then maybe I shouldn't.

112
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:19,820
Hey, my head's killing me right now. Let's go into chapter four. Horde mode. Take a break.

113
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:26,500
I'm probably gonna end the stream. Honestly, I was laughing at like...

114
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,539
All right. What does horde mode mean? I just want to know what it means.

115
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:42,679
Oh, no way. It was kind of... Dude, how the fuck are you supposed to do this?

116
00:38:43,480 --> 00:39:09,429
I used bit rate? What do you mean? All right. Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. This is like making it worse.

117
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:20,139
This is making it worse. This game's fun. It's all right. It's cool. They remade it. I mean,

118
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:34,039
I would like a light gun in my hand, but you know, whatever. I just want to see what makes

119
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:42,500
this horde mode. I'm done. I'm not playing against this guy. I'm not playing against that guy.

120
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:59,380
That was kind of fun. That was House of the Dead remake. Okay, so here's the plan. I didn't stream

121
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,760
yesterday because I had a bad migraine and I was like, I'm gonna be careful today because I don't

122
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,179
want to make it worse so I don't like fuck up the rest of the week's streams. So I'm just gonna stop.

123
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:18,820
I'm drinking water. I'm all right. That was kind of fucking wild. Short one today,

124
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:27,880
but I will be back. We will do a full one on... Where's today? We'll be back on Tuesday,

125
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,360
probably Tuesday and Wednesday. I have a lot of games to play. We got Later Alligator,

126
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:53,559
Bloodwash, power game shit. We got Murder House. Oh my God. Hold on. Listen to this shit. Okay.

127
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:03,429
I'll see you guys on Tuesday. We will do Later Alligator because that's what pre-stream chat

128
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:08,920
voted on. Sorry, I'm only here for like three and a half hours. I kind of planned on only

129
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,820
streaming for like three or four hours today just because of how I felt yesterday. I had a good time.

130
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,420
That was a lot of fun. A dinosaur game was fun. That was cool. I thought it was like an interesting

131
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:24,679
game. The House of the Dead remake. It was all right. I mean, I think it was a little too intense

132
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,639
probably. It was, I think, fun. If you had a like on it, I think it would be way better.

133
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:40,860
This guy hates streaming. I don't hate streaming. Zit, by the way. I developed a zit from that game.

134
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:49,239
I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Quick one. I'll be back on Tuesday, Wednesday,

135
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:55,780
maybe like Tuesday, Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday. We'll see. Whatever. My schedule is

136
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:08,329
all over the place, so we'll see. Thank you. Wait, I didn't want to do that immediately. I

137
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:17,719
want to do this. There we go. Yeah, we'll rate somebody. Let's see who's live right now.

138
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:46,860
Who is currently live? Is Connor live? Yeah, we'll rate Connor. That sounds like a plan. Jesus.

139
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:59,929
You can hear that, right? Mouth sounds. Because my noise gate is off. So you guys get to hear like

140
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,659
yeah, this is why I have a noise gate. This is why all streamers have a noise gate.

141
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:18,090
There, I fixed it. Everybody has a noise gate so you don't hear the weird mouth sounds.

142
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:27,820
Yeah, like, god damn it. I fucking hate that. You just saw me naked. Okay, let's rate Connor.

143
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:53,980
What is Connor doing? What are you up to? Just chatting. Oh, I think Connor's in the process of

144
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:59,099
rating, doing a tier list of all the consoles, all the old consoles. That should be pretty

145
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:07,500
interesting stuff. Pretty cool. I look forward to his absolutely incorrect opinions on everything.

146
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,750
All right, I'll see you guys on Tuesday. Thanks for watching. Bye. Take care of yourselves.

147
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:30,139
Call your mother. Mother's Day, especially. Take care of yourselves. Good night and goodbye.
