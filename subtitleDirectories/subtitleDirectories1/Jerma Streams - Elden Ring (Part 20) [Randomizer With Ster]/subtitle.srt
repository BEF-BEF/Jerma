1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,220
Are you even going to give them five seconds to watch the intro?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,750
No, I can watch. Do you have an intro?

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,469
Yeah, I have like little the solar system thing.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,039
Oh.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,719
Do you not have an intro? Do you stream?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
I mean, I have a starting soon screen like yours.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,120
I thought you meant like an intro, like an actual like animated like intro

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,239
that some people have like.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,359
Oh, no, no.

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,320
Like a special thing.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,840
No, I just mean the starting soon screen.

12
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:37,590
No, I have a fantastic one that would make anyone jealous.

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,299
You got a pretty good one, don't you?

14
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:41,979
Yeah, I do.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,929
I actually I have a streaming question for you.

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:56,729
How long in minutes when you hit the go live button on your OBS, you press the button.

17
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,020
When do you like when does your stream start?

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,500
OK, I'm here. I'm talking and now we're going to do the thing.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,540
How many minutes go by?

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
Wait, wait, wait.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,879
From start of the stream to start of playing the game.

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:15,400
Like you press the start streaming until you talking like you're here.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,439
Until you talk.

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,159
Right.

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,560
OK, I have this really weird issue where I'll turn on my stream

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,959
and the moment my stream goes on, I remember like three or four things that I wanted to do.

27
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,200
Yeah.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,799
And then I do them.

29
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:28,760
OK.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,719
And they are they are totally unrelated to the stream.

31
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,079
Like I can't even remember what it was.

32
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,200
One day I turned on my stream and I was like, oh, wait, yeah, I got to go get the hammer.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,439
And like, dude, like and I just started like setting up some.

34
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,159
I have no.

35
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,840
Wait, you were setting up like a DIY project.

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,560
I don't know.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,439
I can't remember.

38
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,519
I just know that when the stream goes on, I instantly into my brain is like.

39
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,040
Hold on.

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Now would be a great time to do this thing you had not thought of in a week.

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,590
It's weird how that happens.

42
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,829
Your brain just kind of goes, yeah, do this thing.

43
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,390
There's no other opportunity for you to do it.

44
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:07,290
So it depends if I'm doing a DIY project.

45
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,780
Or people seem like five minutes Monday.

46
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,060
Monday is tomorrow.

47
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,780
Hey, what's today?

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,780
I thought today was Monday.

49
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,419
Today's Monday.

50
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,780
Oh, bro, today's Sunday.

51
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:23,659
I went to work and everything.

52
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,699
I showed I showed up at the office and nobody was going on clocked in.

53
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,740
Everyone was looking at me.

54
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,069
Yes, we are pretending we're aware we're a little early.

55
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,569
I but we meant Monday in Australia.

56
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,090
I think that we didn't get that point across Monday in Australia.

57
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,919
So sorry, we forgot to add that part to the end of the stream yesterday.

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,099
Here's the tangent.

59
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,419
OK, so you go off on your tangent before we get started.

60
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:00,969
We finished streaming yesterday.

61
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:01,469
Yeah.

62
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,210
Yesterday was rough.

63
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,449
We were jumping over the lava.

64
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,729
There was a millennia.

65
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,810
There was a lot of issues yesterday, to be honest.

66
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,310
Sure.

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,569
I think it was full of issues.

68
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,810
Barely a minute went by after the stream ended and Strippen messaged me on Discord.

69
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,330
He said, yo, great stream, man.

70
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,289
It's really refreshing.

71
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,330
You watch watching.

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,849
You suck at ass at a game looking forward to the next one.

73
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,180
Soul crushing.

74
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:31,590
So today we got to do better and be better.

75
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,270
No, no, no, no, no, no, enjoy it.

76
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,590
So your goal today is to make sure that Strippen does not enjoy the stream.

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,509
I want him to be bored out of his fucking mind watching my stream.

78
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,669
I want him to be like, God, he was actually good.

79
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:44,629
He was just holding back.

80
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,039
But isn't it?

81
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,360
Hold on.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
But isn't it more fun?

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
We just kind of don't care.

84
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:54,939
Isn't it more fun that way?

85
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:55,180
Do we?

86
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,460
We don't have a look.

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,740
I got really mad last night.

88
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,539
That's how you feel.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,259
Why did you care so much fighting millennia?

90
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,060
Well, because because I hate millennia.

91
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,139
OK, I hate millennia.

92
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,860
There's a difference.

93
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,460
It's the only time during that.

94
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
OK, how many randomized streams have we done?

95
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,340
This would be the fourth one.

96
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,300
This would be this would be number four stream number four.

97
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,220
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,980
But if I roll up and somebody I don't like is there, I'm I'm going to I don't want to.

99
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,019
I don't want to be there.

100
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,819
I want to go somewhere else.

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,939
That's what we should have done.

102
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,620
That's what we should have done.

103
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,779
But you went into gamer mode when you walk in the door and you say it's millennia.

104
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,779
We should have been like, oh, well, we can go anywhere else.

105
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:45,939
But remember, we didn't have the key and the rune.

106
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,819
We got really lucky at the last 20 minutes of stream last night

107
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,259
because we went somewhere else.

108
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,300
We didn't get lucky.

109
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,180
We did what we should have done like hours prior.

110
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,620
Yeah. But all right.

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,540
So why did you keep going in the fog door then?

112
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,180
I wanted to beat her.

113
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,980
Right.

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,779
Because yeah, it's like, oh, you walked away, dude.

115
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,019
Yeah.

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,579
No, it's a strong force.

117
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:11,160
Do you know how many times I was seriously we were walking in the fog door

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,920
and I'm like, let's just fuck this.

119
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,800
Let's do something else.

120
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,439
I mean, I did.

121
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,079
And it doesn't matter.

122
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,360
Yep.

123
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,959
You talked me out of summons.

124
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,560
I would rather abandon ship and go do something else than like

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,519
walk into millennia's room with like a squad of guys.

126
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,959
Why?

127
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,680
There's just something wrong there.

128
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,079
You would rather not beat the thing and then beat the thing.

129
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,040
That's so funny.

130
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,839
There's a full circle of weird like this is going to.

131
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm thinking of this explanation is worth it.

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,040
Okay.

133
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,399
Okay.

134
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,519
Because I was just talking about it.

135
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,000
Actually, there's this show on Netflix that just came out a couple days ago

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,120
called like Physique 100 or something where it's like all of like the top bodybuilders

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,680
and like Olympic gold winners in Korea are doing like squid, squid game style,

138
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,439
like strength tests to like find the perfect body.

139
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,800
Like it's a real competition.

140
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,120
What?

141
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:07,750
Yeah.

142
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,149
So they got like 100 people all super fit and they're doing like just,

143
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,189
you know, like a fitness competition basically, but it's all dubbed.

144
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:17,110
Also, it's hilariously dubbed.

145
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,430
I was laughing nonstop.

146
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,430
The shit that they say and the voice actors are like so not into it and don't have context.

147
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,750
Hilarious the whole way through.

148
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,069
Okay.

149
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,589
But spoiler alert for the Physique 100.

150
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,310
Spoiler alert.

151
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:30,709
Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:31,509
Don't spoil.

153
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:31,910
Okay.

154
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,629
Before you do this, should I just like mute you?

155
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,910
Because like or leave?

156
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,629
Should I take that in my head?

157
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,790
Because it sounds like kind of I might want to watch this.

158
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,470
So you have to spoil the show.

159
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,230
There's only two episodes out so far.

160
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,189
It's not all out.

161
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,350
All right.

162
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,790
So it's not kind of a minor spoiler.

163
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,389
I thought you meant like, oh, this is like a 10 episode, 20 episodes.

164
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:49,189
And this is like the last.

165
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,990
No, I'm not going to like the people like the first real competition that matters.

166
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,870
The winners from like the first thing get to like choose who their opponent is.

167
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,230
So they've got 100 people.

168
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,870
And then there's like, you know, a bunch of like super fucking buff guys.

169
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,029
And then there's also women in the competition.

170
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,589
And it's like a wrestling competition basically.

171
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,829
And they can just fucking pick women.

172
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,829
And it's really fucked up.

173
00:07:15,829 --> 00:07:19,029
And my wife is like, why is this allowed?

174
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:23,829
And then there's one guy that's like, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to wrestle that woman.

175
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:26,550
And everyone's like, what the fuck?

176
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,110
So what I'm saying is you can choose to walk into Melania's room with a squad of goons.

177
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:36,629
But come on, man, like you really shouldn't be like everyone else.

178
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,230
There has like a level of decency where they didn't go there.

179
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,949
All right.

180
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,430
Well, here they can like fair opponents to look good.

181
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,230
Here's but here's the problem with your argument on this.

182
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,689
Melania is fucking unstoppable.

183
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:52,730
I beat her in my run.

184
00:07:53,769 --> 00:08:00,899
But the point to your point is Melania will wipe the floor with a hundred of us.

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,519
That's not true.

186
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,360
Is it?

187
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,350
You're gonna play guilty gear right now.

188
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,399
Oh, yes.

189
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,920
Let's do guilty gear.

190
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,410
Dude, it could be that could be it could be doesn't matter.

191
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,689
It could be like a bug.

192
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,069
It could be a single insect, a single ant in that room.

193
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:36,870
If it is an insanely difficult, strong enemy, what do you think we're going to get our ass kicked?

194
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,070
Regardless doesn't matter.

195
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,259
But then you're going to look twice as bad.

196
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:46,549
If the single ant has the waterfowl move, which doesn't matter.

197
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,350
We we were we were dodging it.

198
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,789
You know, we were we were getting there.

199
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,340
Real life isn't video games.

200
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,139
A single.

201
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,740
Why are summons in the game in all caps?

202
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,259
I understand.

203
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:07,220
I understand your point.

204
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,899
But when you play Elden Ring, it's not in front of an audience that like,

205
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,000
you know, it's a different scenario.

206
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:18,570
Like, yeah, would I wrestle with a girl in the mud?

207
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,039
Sure.

208
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:24,340
But on TV, when I can choose muscular men.

209
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,460
What the fuck is he talking about?

210
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,220
What is he talking about?

211
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,899
What what what is he going on?

212
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:31,620
What is what is he?

213
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,340
What is happening?

214
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,500
Right.

215
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,620
What is he saying?

216
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,899
You have to see the show.

217
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,259
OK, what is he saying?

218
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:43,750
So this is this is like directly tied to this show on Netflix.

219
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,389
Yeah.

220
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,240
OK, so we saying is I have to see this show.

221
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,179
Well, yeah.

222
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:53,059
And then you would agree that you shouldn't mud wrestle with women.

223
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,340
Only muscular men.

224
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
I I don't even know what the context of what you're.

225
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,100
I need to see the show at some point.

226
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,340
Yeah.

227
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,429
All right.

228
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:06,149
Are you ready to fucking smoke a blunt with Placidusix or what?

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,840
I don't have that mod.

230
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,870
You said you'd be back Monday.

231
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,909
You're liars.

232
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:23,190
Well, look, I I was asleep last night and I woke up in the middle of the night

233
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,600
and I had just like I had like laser eyes like I was like, we got to beat it.

234
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,759
I can't wait.

235
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:33,799
I just was like, hey, sir, you're not doing side content.

236
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,740
We're going or what are we doing?

237
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,340
No, we're just doing what we want.

238
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,700
OK, OK.

239
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,259
I thought the laser eyes meant like we have to continue

240
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,139
fucking smash smashing our head against millennia.

241
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,100
No, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,980
I never want to go.

243
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,179
If there's a bazooka mod and we can install it and we can just shoot a bazooka at her

244
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,940
and it's like 5000 damage, we'll do that.

245
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,059
OK, I'm sure someone has made that.

246
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,950
All right. You good?

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,399
Are we good to get started?

248
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,039
Are you in the game?

249
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,559
Yeah, I'm loading up the game.

250
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,679
I'm loading up the game.

251
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,559
I'm continuing.

252
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm loading up the game.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,120
You already made that joke.

254
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
I made that joke in free stream.

255
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm sorry, but it was like it was like not a joke.

256
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,519
There were like 15 people that were there.

257
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,610
He's not joking.

258
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:19,529
Guys, I use pre stream is kind of like, oh, was this funny?

259
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:20,570
Because they go, ha ha ha.

260
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,370
And then I'm like, I got it.

261
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,330
I'm going to use that on the stream.

262
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,379
How lame would that be if you went to like a stand up comics like show

263
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,100
and they're doing a show before people get in the room

264
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,409
and then they just do the show again that that's called rehearsal.

265
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,769
Yeah, that's dress rehearsal.

266
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,450
Okay, they do that on like every major television show.

267
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,889
How lame would it be if like you pay all you go to New York City

268
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,370
and they're like doing a like theater and they're doing they've like rehearsed for it.

269
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,419
Can't they just like can't they just come out and do it?

270
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:58,700
Hey, I've never been to a taping of SNL,

271
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,659
but I'm pretty sure that they do dress rehearsal on SNL before they go live.

272
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,179
So they actually I think they do that on SNL.

273
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,190
So it's all fake.

274
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,230
Sorry.

275
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,259
No, this is it's all fake.

276
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,539
But SNL sucks.

277
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,899
I didn't say I watched it.

278
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:22,490
You got your thing done?

279
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,389
Yeah, hold on.

280
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,309
My controller not working.

281
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,149
My controller not working.

282
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:32,789
What the heck?

283
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,419
Oh, you might say sorry.

284
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,460
My left bumper is not doing anything.

285
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:43,110
I can't I can't block.

286
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,639
Plug it in, plug it in, plug it in, unplug it in.

287
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm plugging, unplugging.

288
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,850
Yeah, okay.

289
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:59,940
I just looked at this and at some point in our rage yesterday,

290
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,179
I changed weapons to the pizza cutter.

291
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,379
I'm like, where is my fire sword?

292
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,740
Where did that go?

293
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,980
I'm looking at this going, why do I have this equipped?

294
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,990
And I'm like, wait, that's right.

295
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,110
I've rage respect to fight millennia.

296
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,549
This thing's still fine.

297
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,779
Did you break it?

298
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:21,659
I don't know.

299
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:23,100
It's only one button, dude.

300
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,429
SNL is funny.

301
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,669
You and Chad are not as funny and jealous crying.

302
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:48,809
I haven't watched an episode of SNL in at least five to ten years.

303
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,980
I've never watched one.

304
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,149
You know, I think it's really funny though,

305
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:00,039
is that like news websites will report on what happened on SNL.

306
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:00,600
Like it's new.

307
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:00,919
Really?

308
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,159
Yeah, like SNL's take on like this political situation.

309
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,279
Did you see it last night?

310
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,360
It's like, fuck you.

311
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
Do some journalism.

312
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:15,110
Fuck you.

313
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:25,000
That's, that's, you know, that's so funny because it's like,

314
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,710
I feel like like reporting on something that was already reported,

315
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,830
that was reported through like a satire kind of website or something.

316
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,110
That kind of happens too, doesn't it?

317
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,379
It's like, don't people eat the onion all the time?

318
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,299
Oh yeah, they do eat the onion.

319
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:49,129
People do news reports on tweets.

320
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:56,309
Yeah, I remember the first time I did see like,

321
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:00,230
they used the tweet and they were talking about it on like a news piece.

322
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,870
And I was like, what the hell is going on?

323
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,789
Nothing that happens on Twitter is real.

324
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:12,460
It's all made up.

325
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,309
Are you joining?

326
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:14,950
I didn't know.

327
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,269
I thought you said you were, I thought you're having controller problems.

328
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:18,789
No, I mean, I'm in the game.

329
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:19,509
I can live with it.

330
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,470
It's just the block button.

331
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,490
You're not allowed to even actually like block anything in this game.

332
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,409
I mean, millennia would destroy me because I did surgery on a grape, bro.

333
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:28,970
What?

334
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm going to look in my closet for my bonus controller.

335
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,909
Where did I end?

336
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:36,710
Oh, there you are.

337
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,950
All right, so let's give a recap.

338
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,659
We just got a huge raid from RT.

339
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,259
RT Game, what's up?

340
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,039
What's going on, RT?

00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,990
Hope everything's going well.

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,429
Hope you had a good stream.

343
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:52,230
RT is awesome.

344
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,669
You don't follow RT.

345
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:55,320
What are you dumb?

346
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,269
What was RT doing?

347
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:02,470
What were you doing, RT?

348
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,620
Persona?

349
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,580
Persona 5.

350
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,389
Cool.

351
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,549
Join us in following RT Game.

352
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:17,509
Wait, what?

353
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,629
This is like a new feature.

354
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,149
You could, wait, what is that?

355
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,240
This is a new feature where you could like,

356
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,600
that's kind of cool.

357
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,720
I didn't know you could do that.

358
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,940
It's cool.

359
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,860
Whoa, that's actually really cool.

360
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,980
Sir, do you like the Persona games?

361
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,289
I feel like you might be one of those Persona fans.

362
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:49,639
You just call me a fucking weeb?

363
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,279
No, it's supposed to have to be very compelling characters

364
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,279
and gameplay and story.

365
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,230
And it's one of the most celebrated RPG franchises in history.

366
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,830
I can't say that I've played any game

367
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,150
that takes you like 400 hours to beat.

368
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:12,940
And you could have just said no.

369
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:18,490
Jermis getting defensive.

370
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,369
Uh-oh.

371
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,130
I just wanted to alienate probably like,

372
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,890
you know, like 50% of the people listening.

373
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,490
I have to, let me be really honest, though.

374
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,049
I have to, let's put all the cards on this table.

375
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,609
I have opened every Persona game that's come to Game Pass.

376
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,990
Game Pass again.

377
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,390
And after like 30 or 40 minutes, I just kind of close it.

378
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,420
Every single one of them.

379
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,259
It's not that I don't like it.

380
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:44,740
I'm just like...

381
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,539
Yeah, I don't like it.

382
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,900
I can say that.

383
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,339
I'm not on contract with the Persona devs.

384
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,700
I played the fighting game,

385
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,420
Persona 4 Arena, I like that game.

386
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:56,819
All right.

387
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,950
So here's what's happening.

388
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,549
It's been 15 minutes.

389
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:04,230
We had our relaxing session.

390
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,069
Oh, so you have a limit of 15.

391
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:07,269
That's why you asked earlier.

392
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:08,789
So you could set a limit.

393
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:14,059
Um, what?

394
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,420
No more, no more talking.

395
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,819
All right.

396
00:18:15,819 --> 00:18:17,980
Listen to me very carefully.

397
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,420
You like literally just brought,

398
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,539
you brought up the topic.

399
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,420
Do you like Arena, like a Persona 4?

400
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,380
And then I got...

401
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,619
You got very angry.

402
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:29,819
We didn't get, we didn't even get to talk about it really in depth.

403
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,579
And then you cut it off and you're like, fine.

404
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,380
He didn't like it.

405
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,259
So like, we're not talking, we're not talking.

406
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:38,940
Oh, dude, you can't convince me to like Persona.

407
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,700
That was, that was that scenario.

408
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,420
Dude, bro, you're not going to be able to convince me to like Persona.

409
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,700
I said, hey, do you like the Persona?

410
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,660
I don't like JRPGs, man.

411
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,779
Like, Final Fantasy?

412
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,740
I, I can't.

413
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:52,380
Yeah, but so, I'm going to keep the conversation going.

414
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,660
Here, new conversation.

415
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,299
If you had to pick any genre of game that you would just be like,

416
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,980
incapable of enjoying.

417
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,619
Yeah.

418
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,420
What is it for you?

419
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,299
Strategy games.

420
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,660
Like, like, stuff like Crusader Kings.

421
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,259
Oh, gosh.

422
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:09,740
I just couldn't.

423
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,380
Oh, my goodness.

424
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,019
I couldn't play it.

425
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:18,150
I feel like I used to be like that, even with like StarCraft.

426
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,099
Well, RTS is different, I think.

427
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,589
But like, I mean, like true, like strategy games.

428
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:25,109
I just, there's just too much for me.

429
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,470
I just, they don't bore me.

430
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,349
They just overwhelm me.

431
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,160
Okay.

432
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,880
So we have the Manor key and we have two runes.

433
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:33,880
All right, let's go to the Manor.

434
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,680
You want, we can actually...

435
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
We can actually go into the room now.

436
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,680
Yeah, let's go to the room.

437
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:47,720
What's your favorite JRPG?

438
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,400
Uh, Chrono Trigger.

439
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,480
Did you play Chrono Trigger?

440
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,039
Nope.

441
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,599
You should.

442
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,160
You really should.

443
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,720
Everybody should.

444
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,000
Everyone.

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,740
That should be required rating to own a console or like a PC.

446
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,099
You should have to do your homework.

447
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,450
You should have to prove that you played it before you get like a console.

448
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,250
It should literally, when you turn, you know, when you turn on your Xbox,

449
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,849
it's like, welcome to Xbox.

450
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:12,329
Set it up.

451
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:13,210
What's your name?

452
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,329
And what's your date of birth?

453
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,289
Before that, it should, the Chrono Trigger splash screen intro should lie.

454
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,180
No, no, no.

455
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,539
Like it's just baked into every console.

456
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,700
Like you have, it's like, here it is.

457
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,130
Like Chrono Trigger, the and you have to play through the whole game

458
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,490
before you can even make your account on Xbox.

459
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,099
Even if you've already played it before.

460
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,220
How would you prove that?

461
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,140
I don't know.

462
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,140
It could like ask you a trivia question.

463
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh yeah.

464
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,059
But no, you could, you could look it up though.

465
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,220
I mean, somebody said, why are you gatekeeping an entire generation?

466
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,420
We just dropped the new halo and we're so excited for you to try it.

467
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,579
Make sure you guys finish Chrono Trigger soon.

468
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:57,819
Yeah.

469
00:20:57,819 --> 00:20:59,019
Want to be trying it.

470
00:20:59,019 --> 00:20:59,259
Yeah.

471
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,900
The new Xbox just dropped, but make sure you get,

472
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,420
make sure you start playing Chrono Trigger.

473
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,569
It's going to take you at least 20 to 40 hours.

474
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,930
Now this is no, what is here?

475
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,809
There's nothing here.

476
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,250
Are we still fucked?

477
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,410
Don't we need an invitation or something?

478
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,049
No, no, no, no.

479
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,250
There's a, there's a secret.

480
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,730
Oh, okay.

481
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,130
The secret.

482
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:17,369
Yep.

483
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,539
See the door in the back.

484
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,380
I just got the Elden Lord helmet.

485
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,359
What is this?

486
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,079
Wait, is there anything?

487
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,220
I don't, I don't remember.

488
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,619
Hold on.

489
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,339
No, I know where it is.

490
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,339
Is there, this is where everybody hangs out,

491
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,019
where you do the, uh, the missions and stuff.

492
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:43,059
It's like here.

493
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,250
Right now.

494
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,099
Guys, which room is it?

495
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,019
It's the room with the, with the girl.

496
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,450
This one here.

497
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,140
Oh, their room.

498
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,839
Oh, their room.

499
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,640
Wrong room.

500
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
I just want to open both of these.

501
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,799
Oh, their room.

502
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,210
You know what the, the, the thing about Millennia is?

503
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,529
Cause I was, I was remembering last night.

504
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:09,769
Yeah.

505
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,970
That millennia is in like the secret area

506
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,910
of like the frost world.

507
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,069
Right.

508
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,029
That's hard to get to.

509
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,910
And then she's in the secret or secret Hallig tree

510
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,109
that I don't even remember how you like,

511
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,869
doesn't she have to do some weird shit to get there?

512
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:25,750
Yeah.

513
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,309
I mean, it's a, it's a, it's an optional secret area.

514
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:28,630
It is.

515
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,869
Yeah.

516
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,390
And then her whole area sucks.

517
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,910
And then you get down there and then it's like, okay.

518
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,910
Mal, like she deserves to suck.

519
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,789
I, I did not hate the Hallig tree area.

520
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,630
You didn't like, you, you like really didn't like the area.

521
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,789
I didn't, I didn't hate it.

522
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:42,700
I would watch out though.

523
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:44,220
I skipped the whole area.

524
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,869
You mean like, like you skipped it as

525
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,190
and you've never played it or you like jumped off

526
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,829
like a ledge and landed like all the way at the bottom or something.

527
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:52,630
I did that.

528
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,869
Okay.

529
00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:54,470
There was the elevator skip.

530
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,829
So I didn't play most of it.

531
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,190
And then I went back and I was like, you know,

532
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,309
I'm curious what's in the Hallig tree.

533
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,589
Like I want to play it like for real.

534
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:01,750
And I fucking hated it.

535
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,099
I'm sorry.

536
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:05,220
I can't hear anything you're saying.

537
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,759
We're just cutting the weeds down.

538
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,970
Ah, this is a big job.

539
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,650
This is going to cost a little extra.

540
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,450
I, uh, I can't, uh, I can't, I can't cast magic

541
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,410
because I can't press my bumper.

542
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,440
What did you do to your controller?

543
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,559
Give me, it's just one button.

544
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:34,039
Give me a second.

545
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,750
I have like an old Xbox 360 controller.

546
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,759
I got to plug it in old Xbox 360 and not an Xbox one controller.

547
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,450
Oh, no, it has.

548
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,289
Well, I was on an Xbox one controller.

549
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,329
This thing has the fucking the weird cable in the middle

550
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,869
that isn't a USB, but it connects to the cable that I've.

551
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,349
I mean, like you go ahead.

552
00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:00,470
I'm dying to poison.

553
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:02,549
I, I know where I'm going.

554
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,029
I'm clear.

555
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:03,829
Okay, don't worry.

556
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:06,460
It's all good.

557
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:06,779
Don't worry.

558
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,180
We're good.

559
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,859
How's everybody doing tonight?

560
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:13,359
Good.

561
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,619
Everybody doing okay?

562
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:19,319
How you been?

563
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,809
You're okay?

564
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:27,930
Hope you're doing all right.

565
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:57,910
Stirr, there's blood on the ground.

566
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,319
So you mentioned before that you don't like JRPGs.

567
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,259
Is there a particular reason as to why?

568
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,140
Is it too slow?

569
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,740
Is it like Stirr wants to go fast?

570
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,019
I'm like walking around my room.

571
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:13,900
Are you talking to me?

572
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,380
Oh, sorry.

573
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,859
No, no, no.

574
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:15,339
Keep doing that.

575
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,460
Keep like wireless.

576
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,140
I don't think I have another controller.

577
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,259
I'm going to die.

578
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,480
Well, I really ruined that.

579
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,039
Sorry, chat.

580
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:25,190
I got his attention and he came back over.

581
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,779
We were trying to we were trying to see if you were going to die.

582
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,299
No, I was just trying to keep you talking.

583
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,900
I figured we would keep you distracted and you just lead the poison river.

584
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,859
You found out that you were walking around your room.

585
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,759
Yeah, so you don't have another controller.

586
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:48,180
No, I would need the extra part of the cable for the other one.

587
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,859
Is it a case of is it like jammed up or something?

588
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,220
I don't know.

589
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,299
I'm using it as hard as I can.

590
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,460
I'm doing tapping.

591
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,900
It's just my left bumper bumper.

592
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,470
You could block button.

593
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:15,109
Theoretically, you could make left trigger cast and you could do like left stick.

594
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,750
Could be walk.

595
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,900
Does that sound stupid?

596
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,269
Because there's literally there's not a single reason to crouch in this game.

597
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,990
There's not one single reason to crouch.

598
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:29,430
You can just rebind in this game, right?

599
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,630
Yeah, like individual buttons.

600
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:39,450
And if you're going to get rid of crouch versus be able to use your shield,

601
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,930
I think that's the best place to put it.

602
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,180
What about crouch attack?

603
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,210
For some weapons, yeah.

604
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,509
Anything else?

605
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:08,420
Okay, that was like a that was like a GTA four video we made and like somebody just

606
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,779
got hit by the car.

607
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,099
Okay, so I went to go rebind my controls.

608
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,619
So I rebound like you said to the stick and then I went back up to crouch and it's like,

609
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:18,740
oh, you have to like change this.

610
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,220
It's red.

611
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,420
So I press left bumper to change it and it worked.

612
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:23,900
There you go.

613
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,529
Why isn't it working in the game?

614
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:30,569
Wait, it doesn't work.

615
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:31,529
It only works on the menu.

616
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,299
Yeah, it will not work in the game.

617
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,660
I think I should like restart my game.

618
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,420
All right, let's let's just like get to a bonfire and then I'm going to restart.

619
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,500
That's that's very weird.

620
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,140
Yeah, that's weird.

621
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:51,660
All right, this doesn't open.

622
00:27:53,769 --> 00:28:01,019
So what I forget what you end up you go like deeper, don't you or something?

623
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,019
There's like a secret wall somewhere again.

624
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:09,190
This was another area.

625
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,029
That's like, why would they like hide?

626
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,470
Change wand hands.

627
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,069
Someone's saying, hey, change wand hands.

628
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,150
I have a shield in my hand.

629
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:20,869
I just switched weapons and it just started like I already had the button down.

630
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:25,910
I was well, that person should be should be commended for that.

631
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:32,569
Because I'm going to reinstall Windows.

632
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:34,329
Just we need to find like a grace to rest up.

633
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,529
Oh, it's over here.

634
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,240
Yeah.

635
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,480
Yeah.

636
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,119
All right, guys, I got to reinstall Windows.

637
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:49,670
The forums were saying this doesn't happen on Linux because like a Gabe Newell alt account.

638
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:06,150
Dude, what is that thing?

639
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,259
Chat chat.

640
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,420
What is that chat?

641
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,619
Chat, what is that?

642
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:13,859
Oh, it's just one of those silent things.

643
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,369
There we go.

644
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,289
Banishing you because I don't think it lets me quit the game until I banish you.

645
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,329
Go ahead.

646
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,250
I restarting and I'm holding up.

647
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,210
I'm holding everything up and it's all my fault that we're late again.

648
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,609
No, that's not true.

649
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:39,849
Yeah.

650
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:40,490
In the menu.

651
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,410
I could if we're totally fine.

652
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,009
Oh, just just reset the whole client.

653
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:56,299
I'm just going to go right back there.

654
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:05,210
I forget where that is here.

655
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:06,339
Stir.

656
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,140
You have a great room.

657
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,180
Go to Landale.

658
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,099
We're going to kill fucking right card.

659
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,059
Yeah, we're going to kill right card.

660
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,890
Do you like radishes?

661
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,460
Um, I can't remember.

662
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,460
I feel like I've had pickled radishes as like part of some Korean meal.

663
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:21,859
No.

664
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:22,819
And I'm like, okay.

665
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,430
Uh, I actually prefer them.

666
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:32,660
Just just I don't know if I like washed just are you like is this like a Doug funny moment?

667
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,539
We're going back to that again.

668
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,460
Like you just eat beats like raw.

669
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
You just like grab a beat and take a chomp out.

670
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,900
I wish I liked beats.

671
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,619
I wish I liked to eat beats like that.

672
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:48,940
They're they're unbelievably that is like the most powerful super food in existence is a beat.

673
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,700
But I think they disgusting.

674
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:59,079
I think they just taste like dirt.

675
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:05,160
Yeah, I I have no mental association with what a radish tastes like.

676
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,039
Uh, they're kind of they're super crunchy.

677
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,519
And when you bite into them, you get that kind of nasal heat.

678
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,319
They're kind of spicy.

679
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,720
Like you get that up here like in the top of your nose.

680
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,849
I've opened my world.

681
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:22,569
I can't relate.

682
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,950
You don't want to eat a shitload of them.

683
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,289
Like wasabi.

684
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,970
It's a little less harsh than wasabi.

685
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,490
I would say a lot less harsh than wasabi.

686
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,130
My intestinal parasites.

687
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:38,650
I'm good.

688
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,359
I I stared death in the eye and I won.

689
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,640
You know, it's really annoying about that conversation yesterday and about how

690
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,299
that whole thing played out.

691
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,240
I had diarrhea this morning and it was just like my dog.

692
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,799
I was just sitting there going fuck that guy.

693
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,960
What the fuck?

694
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,960
It's not fair.

695
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,599
That's what I'm saying.

696
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,799
I got away with it.

697
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,259
I was sitting there just being like, you got to be kidding me.

698
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:09,819
This guy eats raw pork that's been in a backpack for a day and like, oh,

699
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:11,660
my tummy is upset this morning.

700
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,900
I was like, what the fuck, man?

701
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,130
Oh, yeah, that's the millennia shortcut.

702
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:21,099
There it is.

703
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:21,980
Yeah.

704
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,779
Now the door people were telling us to open for like hours yesterday,

705
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,740
but we didn't have the key to do it.

706
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,619
We didn't have the key to do it.

707
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:30,420
But now we need to how do we get to right?

708
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,539
We have to do the invitation shit to do right card, don't we?

709
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:34,740
Here.

710
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,210
There's one way.

711
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,490
If you're an actual god.

712
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,779
No, you can get teleported down there.

713
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:42,500
This jump.

714
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
There's a teleporter that takes you down there.

715
00:32:44,500 --> 00:33:02,279
For one second, for one second, I thought your connection dropped

716
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:08,200
and that was the last sound you made before you got kicked from the discord.

717
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,519
I thought you were like, ah, like, what the fuck?

718
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,240
Like you were like, ah, and it was like, ah, it froze.

719
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,039
I thought you froze and you were just got booted and you've lagged out.

720
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,240
No, I.

721
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:20,839
What's the jump?

722
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,480
How do you do it?

723
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,640
You have to get up on top of this thing.

724
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,720
And then you see where that like that ledge up there,

725
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,160
they patch this.

726
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:31,720
So this is really hard to do, but you can jump from the top of this thing

727
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,119
up to that ledge and then right cards like right up there.

728
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,359
I think VR Josh, that was a great moment.

729
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,519
Stirred tabbed out of a source engine game.

730
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:40,339
All right.

731
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:41,700
So you jump from here to up there.

732
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:44,309
Okay.

733
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,470
But I think you have to like be running on that.

734
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,390
So you have to like run in a circle, which is why.

735
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,670
Bro got it first try.

736
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,710
Where are we going from here?

737
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,670
That's not the hard part.

738
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,740
Oh, now we're to get on top of the metal circle.

739
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,880
And then you have to be able to jump to the ledge.

740
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,609
He's killing it tonight.

741
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,690
Now guide me a little more.

742
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:13,690
Uh, I forget exactly what you're aiming for, but you need to like land

743
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,860
like on the ledge so you can get up to that high ground.

744
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,380
Oh, yeah, that's that's the chat saying it's almost impossible.

745
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:30,070
It is possible.

746
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,550
Dude, I we have switched bodies.

747
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,579
I don't fucking just wait, just wait.

748
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:38,460
I'll get it.

749
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:48,300
Stripping is eating right now.

750
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,619
Okay.

751
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,500
What is that?

752
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,139
Okay.

753
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,030
Stripping is eating right now.

754
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,750
Like he's like, I was trying to be better so he wouldn't enjoy me being bad.

755
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,949
And I've jumped off the map twice in like 10 minutes of gameplay.

756
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:07,980
So right now, Stripping, you tell him, Stripping just took a big bite out of

757
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,579
like a fucking steak and cheese, whatever he's eating.

758
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:13,420
He's probably just like, he's like laughing and like food just came out of his mouth.

759
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,619
Yeah, we're not going to.

760
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,900
I don't want to sit around and do this jump.

761
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,300
It's you're not getting it.

762
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,420
Is it actually patched up?

763
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:19,900
It's patched.

764
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,300
It's patched.

765
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,780
It's patched.

766
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,300
It is patched, but it is possible, but it's incredibly incredible.

767
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,619
Okay.

768
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:28,059
So the number one question is, here's our two options.

769
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,019
Let's go fight Melania.

770
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:32,889
No, no, no, there are there.

771
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,260
There's a way to get down to that.

772
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,750
No, no, there's a way to get down to Rikard.

773
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,389
You get ported there without having to do anything.

774
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:44,949
I know it.

775
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:46,550
I've done it accidentally before.

776
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,139
How do you get down to that room?

777
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:50,579
The one right before Rikard?

778
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:51,860
There's a way to get down there.

779
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,389
It's part of a quest.

780
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:55,829
You can't do the quest.

781
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:56,309
Okay.

782
00:35:56,389 --> 00:35:57,269
The envelopes.

783
00:35:57,269 --> 00:36:00,539
Okay, let's go kill Melania.

784
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:00,780
Fine.

785
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,300
All right.

786
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,579
My God, dude.

787
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:04,139
We're doing this.

788
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,739
We're attempting this one time.

789
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:06,300
And then we are.

790
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,739
I'm telling you right now.

791
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,780
I am immediately porting to one millennia fight, one millennia fight.

792
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,420
And then we are.

793
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,539
And I'm talking about we are.

794
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:19,059
I'm porting to outside of Landell.

795
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,420
Yeah, we're gonna go do land.

796
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,940
You understand the terms here, right?

797
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,260
Yeah.

798
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,900
You get the terms?

799
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:25,460
Yes.

800
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,019
Also, do I have a way to turn in the other?

801
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,900
I got Mogues room.

802
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,059
Do we have the tower so we can go to the top?

803
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,110
I forget which one is Mogues.

804
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,420
Let's head away.

805
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,730
Because I know we have access to one more tower.

806
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,409
Everybody's saying like, how do they not know this?

807
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:43,849
You guys have to understand.

808
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:44,730
You have to remember.

809
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,090
There was like an entire human history worth of stuff in this game.

810
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:56,250
It's like an entire human history with like lore books and like thousands of pieces of documents.

811
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,170
It's a lot.

812
00:36:58,809 --> 00:36:59,929
So we don't remember.

813
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:19,190
Come on, bring it on.

814
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,440
Okay.

815
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Be careful.

816
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,119
Pretty clean.

817
00:37:39,239 --> 00:38:21,210
Not bad.

818
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,610
Pretty good.

819
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:24,460
Not good.

820
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,800
A little cautious.

821
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,480
That's why.

822
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,039
Dude, her fight should be in a room with pillars.

823
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,019
Actually, kind of should be.

824
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:38,820
Actual fight.

825
00:38:39,539 --> 00:39:07,900
Oh, fuck.

826
00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:09,980
Oh, fuck.

827
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,179
That was the worst time.

828
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:09,780
Just hit her.

829
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,739
Dude, I can't.

830
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Just press the attack button once, dude.

831
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,519
What's the problem?

832
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,159
Dude, you're not allowed to play this video game against this character with a weapon

833
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:37,400
that's less than like a tenth of a second swing time.

834
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,239
I'm not supposed to come in here with a dagger.

835
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,889
You can't attack Millenia with a weapon that is like a two-handed sprinkler.

836
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,429
You just can't.

837
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:24,599
If I hit R1, I die.

838
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,460
I die if I hit R1.

839
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,260
Let me hit R1.

840
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,380
Dead.

841
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:43,239
There's no opportunity, man.

842
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,719
They give you enough opportunity to swing with a katana.

843
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:48,360
They made that character for katanas only.

844
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,039
Hey, don't you have a moon veil you were going to give me?

845
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,429
I did, didn't I?

846
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:54,460
Yeah.

847
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Jump attack if it takes too long.

848
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:05,059
No, you should jump attack.

849
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,340
And don't you have like multiple fully upgraded two-handers?

850
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,539
Because two-hand, like they nerfed it a bit, but dual wielding two-handers

851
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:15,480
and doing jump attacks on her is actually like pretty good.

852
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:20,760
And then I have a claw talisman for bonus on jump attack.

853
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,210
Let's do it again.

854
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,530
Okay.

855
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,070
Are we changing anything?

856
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,550
No, I got it.

857
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,349
Want the talisman?

858
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:28,710
Are you going to give me the moon veil?

859
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,670
I got the jump attack.

860
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,980
Didn't I give you the moon?

861
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,860
Oh, I thought I gave it to you.

862
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,630
Did you?

863
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,599
Yeah.

864
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,960
Wasn't I like, oh, look, look, look.

865
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,400
And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah.

866
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:44,119
I think I told you not to give it to me.

867
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,099
How come I don't?

868
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,139
Did I sell it?

869
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:47,099
Oh, no, I have it.

870
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:47,420
Okay.

871
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,699
Well, it's like not upgraded.

872
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,829
Wait, moon veil has bleed on it?

873
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:53,480
I think so, yeah.

874
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:53,980
Why?

875
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:04,599
That's why it's easy mode.

876
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:06,710
All right.

877
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,750
I knew it had bleed.

878
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,949
No, let's get out of here.

879
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:09,909
I'm getting out of here.

880
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:11,510
How do I get out of here quick?

881
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,829
All right.

882
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:13,030
I'm just somber five.

883
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,989
I went to Capitol Rampart.

884
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:14,469
Go.

885
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,670
Do you have a somber five?

886
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:15,989
Yeah.

887
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,110
No, we're fighting her one more time.

888
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,829
No, no, no.

889
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:18,550
Do it now.

890
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,030
No.

891
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,349
Get out.

892
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,909
Get me out of here.

893
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,349
All right.

894
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,590
Okay.

895
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,309
We just lost it.

896
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,469
I was like, yeah, fucking this, fucking that.

897
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:25,590
I'm fucking this, fucking that.

898
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,070
No, no, no.

899
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,869
Get me out of here.

900
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:28,230
We just need some levels.

901
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,420
No, get me out of here.

902
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,460
It's somber five.

903
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,539
I'll give you a somber five.

904
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:40,980
Get me out of here.

905
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,019
There's no way.

906
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,460
There's no way we're going to sit there

907
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,099
for like another two hours where I just continue.

908
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:48,179
Every time we lose, I'm going to pull.

909
00:43:48,179 --> 00:43:48,900
Here's what I'm going to do.

910
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,260
I'm going to say exactly what's going to happen.

911
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,059
I'm going to grab this.

912
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:52,980
This is coming up here.

913
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,019
And I'm going to talk like this really, really angrily.

914
00:43:56,659 --> 00:44:00,340
Like, I'm very, this is, look at how intent this is.

915
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,980
Somber five.

916
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,510
Somber five, daddy.

917
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,469
Daddy, somber five.

918
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:06,469
Listen to me.

919
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,099
How many do you just want?

920
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,300
Just one.

921
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:17,300
Do you have an eight?

922
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,559
An eight and an ancient.

923
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,500
I have an eight.

924
00:44:24,059 --> 00:44:25,500
I do not have an ancient.

925
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,139
Give me the eight.

926
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,750
You've taken all these from me.

927
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,269
I've given you like so much.

928
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:33,670
Yeah, but these are so much more valuable and you've taken them.

929
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,150
We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.

930
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,429
Let's go to the road of the manor real quick.

931
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,869
Okay.

932
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:42,789
Are you doing, are you upgrading Moonville?

933
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:43,269
Yeah.

934
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:44,710
No, I don't like this arc.

935
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,010
You don't like this arc?

936
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,489
I've been using a fucking long sword all game.

937
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,329
You have gone through like six weapons.

938
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:51,690
You upgraded the finger.

939
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,210
You upgraded Giza's wheel.

940
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,889
Hey, where is my finger, by the way?

941
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,570
I want that shit back.

942
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,900
Oh, I'm taking up all the sombers.

943
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,750
This is like the first time.

944
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,139
Hey, hey, I'm getting, I'm getting you your fucking finger.

945
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:07,940
Wait, wait, everyone relax.

946
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,980
And you can three finger my ass.

947
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,480
No, no.

948
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,210
What's going to happen?

949
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,210
You can do this, but not right now.

950
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,250
And I'll tell you why.

951
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,929
Because you're going to upgrade this.

952
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:21,289
You're going to, you're going to like do R1, L2, L2.

953
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,730
And you're going to go, all right, let's go fighter again.

954
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,420
No, we're going to go do Lane Doe.

955
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,300
No, you're going to want to take that to Millennia.

956
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,179
I know it.

957
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:30,500
I don't.

958
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:46,570
Oh, let's go.

959
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,070
Millennia?

960
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,929
No, I'm fucking, I haven't even upgraded a plus one yet.

961
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:52,170
Entertain yourself for a moment, dear.

962
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,210
Okay, fine.

963
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:07,619
I've actually never used Moonville.

964
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:08,340
It's so good.

965
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,300
It's unbelievably good.

966
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,260
Do you have a nine?

967
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,300
I do not.

968
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,539
Okay, I just need nine in ancient.

969
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:16,260
It would be max.

970
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,650
I don't even think I'm going to use it till it's max.

971
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:53,559
I wish I could just slide off.

972
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,159
Why am I doing this?

973
00:46:55,719 --> 00:47:15,699
Okay, I'm just thinking about the good times, man.

974
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,889
I mean, Plastiducic, smoking up blood.

975
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:23,210
He didn't even fucking answer my call anymore.

976
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:30,789
I'm going to hang out with this motherfucker.

977
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:32,789
His weed sucks.

978
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:37,380
It's got this low quality dog shit weed.

979
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,739
It's so awful Plastiducic's had that fucking good shit.

980
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:55,190
All right, you ready?

981
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,329
Yeah, I voted to travel.

982
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:05,590
All right, vote to travel.

983
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:12,619
I knew he was going to do like L1, L2, L2.

984
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:14,699
And now he's going to be like, oh, I can beat Millennia by myself.

985
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,420
It's just like Neo.

986
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,219
Want to go give it a try?

987
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:22,840
No, I don't.

988
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,079
It's going to be really weak unless it's fully upgraded.

989
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:30,840
My whole build is on some cheesy Glintstone pebble Ash of War gimmick.

990
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,719
Hey, by the way, we're going to have to fight over the next larval tier.

991
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,030
I'm going to do rock, paper, scissors for it.

992
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,429
I thought I had one.

993
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:44,389
Oh, you do.

994
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:50,219
I don't know.

995
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,139
You have so much stuff in your inventory.

996
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:53,340
Do you need a larval?

997
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,980
Yeah, I have one.

998
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:56,090
Build to hold it.

999
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,050
Nah, for now, because I feel like this is going to be an opportunity

1000
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,010
where one of us is going to go.

1001
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,690
I hate everything that I'm doing right now.

1002
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:03,369
Spoiler alert.

1003
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:05,449
Those of you that are watching the VOD right now, it's me.

1004
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:09,449
So in like an hour or so, I'll be respecting to something else.

1005
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,059
Nice.

1006
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:28,460
I actually really like this zone.

1007
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:34,360
Ooh, that's a lot.

1008
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,980
Your favorite Elden Ring zone.

1009
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:40,260
Probably this one.

1010
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,579
No, it's Limgrave.

1011
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:50,119
The reason why I like Lindell so much is because you start to realize

1012
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,599
that you are so close to getting to the base of the tree.

1013
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,800
And once you can see the opening there, it's almost like, wait a second.

1014
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:04,820
Oh, you can go in it like I'm right there the whole time.

1015
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,739
The game has been teasing this gigantic tree.

1016
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:10,739
And when you're finally there, it's this moment of holy shit.

1017
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:11,940
I'm here right now.

1018
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,300
I'm actually at this place.

1019
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:19,179
It's been a distant thing for potentially tens of hours.

1020
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,260
Now it's right here.

1021
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,869
That's not in the game.

1022
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,039
God from software does not fucking miss except for when they made Millennium.

1023
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:30,920
It is big time.

1024
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:39,429
Where are you?

1025
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:40,550
I don't know.

1026
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:43,159
Where are you?

1027
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,119
I had lobster and doot at me.

1028
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,400
Oh, you're dead?

1029
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:47,880
Yeah.

1030
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,679
Oh, you die.

1031
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,880
How come I didn't even hear you die?

1032
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,920
Because you were talking about how much you love Elden Ring.

1033
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:57,289
You died.

1034
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,329
Yeah, that was crazy.

1035
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,210
Who even killed me?

1036
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,699
Holy shit.

1037
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,690
That was somehow your fault.

1038
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:07,369
Fuck you.

1039
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,500
Where are you now?

1040
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,780
I went back to where you were.

1041
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,659
I was on my way back because there's like a bonfire right

1042
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:16,900
there.

1043
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,579
No, I don't think millennia is not that bad.

1044
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,230
It just is.

1045
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:27,429
She's not that bad.

1046
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:28,389
She just is.

1047
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,670
I'm back into like jumping instead of rolling mode.

1048
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:32,630
Really?

1049
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:35,269
Yeah, my brain needs to reset a little bit.

1050
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:38,710
Yeah, because short-term memory took over yesterday,

1051
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,469
but long-term memory took over this morning.

1052
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:41,829
That's interesting how that works.

1053
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:52,869
This lobster is huge.

1054
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,909
Please kill it.

1055
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:56,630
It's like one hit.

1056
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,150
It's going to shoot me again.

1057
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:06,920
Oh, you are unhappy right now.

1058
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,260
It's all right.

1059
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,539
I'm glad stripping is happy.

1060
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,000
That's the problem.

1061
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,440
Stripping is in your head.

1062
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:17,639
See, when you died from that lobster shot right there,

1063
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,719
all you could think about was stripping,

1064
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,480
just like spitting food out of his mouth,

1065
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,320
pointing at the screen and like laughing.

1066
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,280
You know what I mean?

1067
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,119
Like a full open mouth and like mashed potatoes and shit.

1068
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,559
Gravy comes out of his mouth and stuff.

1069
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:30,280
That's what you're seeing.

1070
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,199
You need to get stripping out of your head.

1071
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:34,150
I can't.

1072
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,030
He's too handsome.

1073
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,280
Yeah, that's what's happening right now.

1074
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:43,539
Yeah, he's eating a whole turkey dinner right now.

1075
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,820
He's got stuffing and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce.

1076
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,659
I am not going to die again the rest of the stream.

1077
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,329
I am activating blood cult initiate.

1078
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,760
Oh, dark gamer god mode.

1079
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,079
Oh, I grant you my soul.

1080
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,550
Not you.

1081
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,389
I'm talking to the ancient deep gods.

1082
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:14,070
That seems like a really bad thing to sell your soul for

1083
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,590
is to like be good at Elton.

1084
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:18,070
No, it's all games.

1085
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:23,000
Okay.

1086
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:25,340
You wouldn't understand.

1087
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,900
So what you're hoping for is you're hoping for like you dodge,

1088
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,820
dodge, dodge, stripping, sitting there like,

1089
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,420
okay, you know that scene in Lord of the Rings

1090
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,860
where like the king is like eating the tomatoes

1091
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,030
and shit during the battle?

1092
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:38,949
Like you're just waiting for that moment.

1093
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,349
It's cutting to stripping like you're dodging, dodging,

1094
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:44,150
like eating the chicken and shit, stripping his mouth.

1095
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:47,429
What the fuck is this fucking tomato eating noise?

1096
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:48,869
Have you never seen Lord of the Rings?

1097
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:50,409
I don't remember this scene.

1098
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:53,940
Oh, have you not seen Lord of the Rings?

1099
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,219
The scene, how do you not remember this?

1100
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,619
The other recent prime video Lord of the Rings show

1101
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:02,579
erased all of my memory of Lord of the Rings.

1102
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,559
Oh shit, that's a dragon.

1103
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:16,059
All he knows is Neo now.

1104
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,599
That's all you have up there is like Neo information.

1105
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,280
It's true.

1106
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,280
I just, I like go 100% in a thing

1107
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,429
and then everything else is just removed from the brain.

1108
00:54:29,429 --> 00:54:33,269
How far, how close are you to completing Neo 2?

1109
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:33,909
No idea.

1110
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:35,829
I wonder how close you are.

1111
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,119
It feels like I'm getting close.

1112
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,960
I decided I wanted to play a little today,

1113
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,719
but I decided like if we're going to keep playing Elden Ring,

1114
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,340
I'm not doing it, cutting myself off

1115
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,380
because it's going to keep,

1116
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,090
I don't know, my brain is just going to turn to mush.

1117
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,099
True, that's all right.

1118
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:03,619
You could, I mean, hey,

1119
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,579
it's not a bad thing to have something you really like

1120
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:10,219
to be able to do whenever you want.

1121
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:11,099
That's not a bad thing.

1122
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:18,179
In fact, I feel like a lot of people might be envious of that

1123
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:21,380
because, oh shit, like, oh, I did this, now what?

1124
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,739
I got nothing to do, nothing to play.

1125
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:23,860
I wish there was some better games.

1126
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,099
You got something that you're ready just to go right back to.

1127
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:31,739
Yeah, I was getting annoyed when streamers are like,

1128
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:33,500
it's a fucking game drought right now.

1129
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
There's like no games, there's nothing.

1130
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,139
Are you one of those?

1131
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:38,460
Are you one of those like there's no games right now?

1132
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,300
Because I don't, you don't seem like you'd be one

1133
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,659
because you're willing to go back and play fucking driver in the PS1.

1134
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,019
My most played game on stream is House Lipper.

1135
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:50,219
I think, yeah, this is not the right person to ask this.

1136
00:55:51,019 --> 00:55:53,500
Okay, but yeah, no, I know what you mean.

1137
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,159
Look, there's like 20 years, 30 years, a millennia of video games.

1138
00:55:59,159 --> 00:55:59,719
Just pick one.

1139
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:04,969
That didn't work.

1140
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:17,619
Wait, there's a millennia of video games?

1141
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:18,900
Yep.

1142
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:21,559
I stole that from Chad.

1143
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,360
It sounds like a Chad comment now you say it.

1144
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,780
Anybody that says there's no games,

1145
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:35,500
I don't want to hear it if you haven't played Gex.

1146
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,860
You haven't beat Chrono Trigger yet.

1147
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,260
It's true.

1148
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,659
Yeah, I've never been done.

1149
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:49,079
I like how you're actually experiencing the game still.

1150
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:50,679
This is still cool.

1151
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:55,269
I got so lost in this area for a really long time.

1152
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,969
It's, it is very, very easy to get lost here.

1153
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,340
I think I have been down there.

1154
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,059
I'm just forgetting.

1155
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,860
There's a I'm trying to I this is okay.

1156
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,059
This is my favorite area.

1157
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,820
I still have no idea where the hell I'm going.

1158
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,619
Oh, there's an I think there's an elevator in here that takes us.

1159
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,179
Yeah, you go down to the kind of courtyard level

1160
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,300
and then there's a few ways to go.

1161
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,400
I know that when you get to the top,

1162
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,880
you jump off the roof and you land on the other roof

1163
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,880
and then you skip the area and you see bed curses

1164
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,960
that item right there in a regular playthrough.

1165
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,920
Saved a little bit of time.

1166
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,960
This guy kind of knows where he's at.

1167
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,590
This guy is like aware of this.

1168
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,070
And that thing's going to be really annoying.

1169
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,110
Where even is it?

1170
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:37,989
Oh, I don't know.

1171
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:43,980
Um, this is what is that?

1172
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:46,150
Is that what?

1173
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,710
What is this?

1174
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,349
A dragon?

1175
00:57:47,909 --> 00:57:48,710
Wait, I'm poisoned.

1176
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:50,469
What is what the fuck even is in the building here?

1177
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:53,960
That's a dragon or a gargoyle.

1178
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:58,710
I've anchored it.

1179
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:01,349
Wait, did you jump?

1180
00:58:01,349 --> 00:58:02,789
What side did you jump down?

1181
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:03,429
I didn't jump down.

1182
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:03,989
I'm still up here.

1183
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:05,909
I was hitting the wing inside this room.

1184
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:06,630
Oh, come down here.

1185
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,150
This guy's actually hard and sucks.

1186
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:13,130
Well, I kind of said I wasn't going to die again.

1187
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:33,909
All right, I'll take care of it.

1188
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:41,059
Oh, yeah, that guy's usually here.

1189
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,619
I wonder maybe forever here.

1190
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,739
He's that good of a guardsman.

1191
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:56,250
Oh, God.

1192
00:58:56,969 --> 00:59:01,079
Is that coming through the wall?

1193
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,079
Holy shit.

1194
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,030
He just turned this whole area into a virtual boy game.

1195
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,809
I've said that before pretty recently.

1196
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:15,400
No repeat jokes.

1197
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,440
This is a rehearsal.

1198
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,280
Hey, sometimes the good ones get to stay.

1199
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:24,710
You imagine in the like, where was the fire?

1200
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,460
Oh, oh, that's where he is.

1201
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,380
Oh, my God.

1202
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,739
It's got a lot of health.

1203
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,460
Yeah.

1204
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,579
Can it actually hurt us though?

1205
00:59:36,579 --> 00:59:40,739
Oh, he says as my head gets pancake.

1206
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,190
Wait, it's up in the air.

1207
00:59:45,909 --> 00:59:48,710
I think we're safe from the fire though.

1208
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,449
I guess not.

1209
00:59:51,449 --> 00:59:53,369
Can you stop saying shit like that?

1210
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,170
It's like a Marvel movie.

1211
00:59:58,969 --> 00:59:59,369
Oh, man.

1212
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:00,329
It's all right.

1213
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:01,610
Fire can't get us in here.

1214
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,130
Whoa, all right.

1215
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,849
Burnt me.

1216
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:07,210
What the heck, Star Lord?

1217
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,090
Burnt me?

1218
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,369
It burnt me.

1219
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:13,289
Oh, burp me, Star Lord.

1220
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:14,250
I like that.

1221
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,210
I like that version.

1222
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:23,210
Legendary in here.

1223
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:28,309
Not going to minus two that one.

1224
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,869
Get out of here.

1225
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:33,670
Oh, man.

1226
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,630
That's, that's unfortunate.

1227
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,630
That joke went really well in rehearsal.

1228
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,670
Lord Rune.

1229
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:39,909
That's like 30, 40K, right?

1230
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:43,030
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,750
I don't have power.

1232
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,889
I'm trying to do something.

1233
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:50,090
Get the fuck away from me.

1234
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,349
The dragons have blood.

1235
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,099
Apparently.

1236
01:00:58,579 --> 01:00:59,139
This can I make?

1237
01:00:59,139 --> 01:00:59,940
Can I make him bleed?

1238
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:01,460
I wonder.

1239
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,139
You should be able to.

1240
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,630
At least the fire can't get us in.

1241
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:28,340
Oh, I don't even know what you're swinging at.

1242
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,090
But oh, you can't.

1243
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:31,610
You couldn't see it.

1244
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:31,849
No.

1245
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,380
Do we we both stack bleed together

1246
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:36,739
if we're both bleeding, right?

1247
01:01:36,739 --> 01:01:37,940
I believe that's accurate.

1248
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,179
Yes.

1249
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,969
I mean, I don't see why not.

1250
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,210
I think the dragon is on.

1251
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:44,329
I think the dragon is on the roof.

1252
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:50,869
No.

1253
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:52,170
Where do you go?

1254
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,369
There's a lot of guys in this room

1255
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:54,969
and they're all aggroed to the dragon.

1256
01:01:58,329 --> 01:02:02,789
They are fighting the dragon.

1257
01:02:07,989 --> 01:02:08,710
Oh, shit.

1258
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:12,070
I don't know.

1259
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,150
It's a fucking jellyfish.

1260
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,150
It's a spell.

1261
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:19,110
He's casting bubble.

1262
01:02:28,809 --> 01:02:29,849
Oh, my God.

1263
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:30,250
Dragons.

1264
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,289
Dragons almost dead.

1265
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:40,119
How do we get?

1266
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,219
We're supposed to go like down

1267
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:52,340
to the courtyard down there.

1268
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:53,860
Yeah, I'm trying to.

1269
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,059
I just want to kill the dragon.

1270
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:56,019
Yeah, it's smart.

1271
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,099
Nice wicked spot.

1272
01:02:59,059 --> 01:03:01,400
Put your head up here, please.

1273
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:02,840
There it is.

1274
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,780
Come here.

1275
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,110
Why do I need mana?

1276
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:08,920
What?

1277
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:12,199
I didn't just take this took mana.

1278
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,610
It's a webinar that I'm pretty sure they all do.

1279
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:24,889
You're hitting it right now.

1280
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:25,929
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

1281
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,570
I just see a health bar in the sky

1282
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:31,530
that's like taking.

1283
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,230
OK, great job.

1284
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:38,949
We get an item.

1285
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:43,559
Do you think that when dragons die,

1286
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:44,679
they turn to dust like that

1287
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,360
because of how much weed they've been smoking with you?

1288
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,630
Like all the vapors just come out.

1289
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,550
And it was all right.

1290
01:03:57,110 --> 01:04:00,199
It was all right.

1291
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:01,559
Oh, he's doing the jump strap.

1292
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:06,889
I didn't get it from here.

1293
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:07,769
You go down.

1294
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:08,889
I don't think this is OK.

1295
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:09,449
But we.

1296
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:16,659
Yeah, hold on.

1297
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:17,300
Great sword.

1298
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,420
I got a few things here.

1299
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,219
Let me see what these are.

1300
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,639
Yeah, that's my first carrion.

1301
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:25,639
I've upgraded carrion staff all game.

1302
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:26,760
My first carrion spell.

1303
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,179
I think I have some carrion shit

1304
01:04:32,179 --> 01:04:34,170
that you would want if you like.

1305
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:34,889
But you don't.

1306
01:04:34,889 --> 01:04:36,969
I mean, we're changing our builds so frequently.

1307
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:38,650
I'm not.

1308
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,050
I've been using the same.

1309
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,730
I switched once and then I switched back

1310
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:43,849
because I realized that was wrong.

1311
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:46,889
That is the that is more than I have.

1312
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:52,809
OK, Mr.

1313
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:55,610
Like I have upgraded like seven weapons this run.

1314
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,570
I have what?

1315
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,369
Plus one to plus two in three or four weapons.

1316
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:05,190
I only have two items that are over plus five

1317
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,329
and one of them is the finger.

1318
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:08,090
It doesn't count because you stole it from me.

1319
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,019
OK, it's one of these things.

1320
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:12,860
Get ready.

1321
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,539
Oh, I don't have the heels anymore.

1322
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,619
Which is like half the reason I did it.

1323
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:17,260
No, no, no.

1324
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,460
This thing is OK.

1325
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,420
This isn't OK.

1326
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,780
This guy is just it's one of those

1327
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:23,659
centuries or what it's what are they called?

1328
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,679
I'll tell you the weapon that you get from these things

1329
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:29,880
are is actually really fun.

1330
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:34,440
Yeah, the dual welding light weapons.

1331
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,610
I don't know what's happening.

1332
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:38,650
My screen like froze.

1333
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,500
Crucible.

1334
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,940
Oh, I can look cool now.

1335
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,750
I also got a crucible tree armor.

1336
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:59,000
I got the armor.

1337
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,800
You got the helmet.

1338
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,000
I'm so much hotter than you.

1339
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:09,860
No, you look like you're going to play Warframe.

1340
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:13,460
You do.

1341
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:22,920
OK, look.

1342
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:32,389
Is she talking to you?

1343
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,550
No, she did earlier.

1344
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,860
I told her I am already married and I can't be seen with you.

1345
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,380
The Lord's runes.

1346
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,059
Do I need to use that for anything else?

1347
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:54,250
Or is it just purely an enormous amount of runes?

1348
01:06:54,409 --> 01:06:57,880
Uh, wow, that's a lot.

1349
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:11,050
We break 100 K.

1350
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:12,650
Come on.

1351
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,769
Can we break 100 K?

1352
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:21,500
Never mind.

1353
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,460
It wasn't the magic.

1354
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,420
It was an ash of war.

1355
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:46,940
Guys, we didn't break 100 K out here.

1356
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:50,150
There is on one side.

1357
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:54,059
There's usually a tour left.

1358
01:07:54,059 --> 01:07:55,340
There's a big scary man.

1359
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:59,050
OK, for one second, I was like, what did the mod do?

1360
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,250
And why is this dragon so big?

1361
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,869
How what is happening?

1362
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:11,909
But like a meteor landed on my head.

1363
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:13,769
Meteor?

1364
01:08:14,409 --> 01:08:18,779
Yeah, I have no idea what that was.

1365
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:23,479
There's usually an ulcerated tree spirit over here somewhere.

1366
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,199
Right?

1367
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:28,470
It wasn't this thing, was it?

1368
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:29,510
That was a lot of damage.

1369
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:41,100
Yeah, there's like some big creature under the ground

1370
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,750
that's occasionally hitting me inside this building.

1371
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,829
OK, well, let's go find it.

1372
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,989
Yeah, it's shaking the whole game.

1373
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,079
It's a bear behind us.

1374
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,020
Oh, there is a bear.

1375
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:57,699
Oh, fuck.

1376
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:58,500
That's a big one.

1377
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,619
OK, he wasn't actually stuck.

1378
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:06,659
He was just like pretending.

1379
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:24,010
Oh, where's the bleed?

1380
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:25,770
How many times I got to hit you?

1381
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:44,659
He's this once would be nice.

1382
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,359
Oh, you're going to me?

1383
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:51,609
Yeah.

1384
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:52,729
Once what?

1385
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:54,470
Hitting him once.

1386
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:59,939
Oh, he can't come down the hallway.

1387
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,520
What is the bleed resistance on this bear?

1388
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,239
Holy shit.

1389
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:13,800
I just held this on his like butt for a solid five straight seconds.

1390
01:10:20,739 --> 01:10:22,979
I that was he dropped beast blood.

1391
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:23,699
I don't like that.

1392
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,739
All right, so we can either go up and going up

1393
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:31,100
brings us to Godfrey's room.

1394
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:32,659
Right.

1395
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,949
I prefer Godfrey.

1396
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,500
I already have one of these.

1397
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,270
Or we can go down into the well

1398
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,949
and go down to the what the shunning grounds or whatever it is.

1399
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:49,109
Oh, the sewers down to the tree fingers.

1400
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:53,270
The tree is also looks like kind of sneaking around down.

1401
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:57,029
There is glint stone dragon, glint stone dragon.

1402
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,069
Yeah, he's like totally blocking the whole sewer.

1403
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,909
It like that's probably the not a good way to go right now.

1404
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,380
Dude, dual Omen, dual well, dual Omen, dual Omen, please.

1405
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,300
That's not a bad idea.

1406
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:23,109
No, the mashed potatoes just shot out of his mouth.

1407
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,949
The mashed potatoes just launched out of stripping's mouth.

1408
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,359
God damn it, dude.

1409
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:34,010
Dude, that was like a fucking looney tune episode.

1410
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,390
Dude, I would be careful, man.

1411
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:43,430
You stripping right now may have just eaten like a chicken wing

1412
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:48,869
and it's like you may have choked him because that was so funny.

1413
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,949
And he only said I don't think he's watching.

1414
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:52,630
I don't think he's going to watch the VOD.

1415
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:54,390
I just I'm not going to bring any of this up.

1416
01:11:55,189 --> 01:12:04,550
Dude, you were just you were like one, two, three, just right over the edge.

1417
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:06,069
It was so perfect.

1418
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,390
I was like totally spaced out in my head.

1419
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,609
Oh, man, I only barely.

1420
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:18,010
That was so perfect.

1421
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:21,609
Well, a little fresh restart, reset my pact.

1422
01:12:21,609 --> 01:12:23,369
That has to be the ultimate fall joke.

1423
01:12:28,569 --> 01:12:30,090
Your reaction was immediate.

1424
01:12:30,649 --> 01:12:38,220
Sombra seven.

1425
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,180
I'm not going to say that out loud.

1426
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,300
I don't want him to know I have one of these.

1427
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:40,779
It's mine.

1428
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:44,119
I need a nine.

1429
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,579
I needed a somber nine and a ancient one.

1430
01:12:48,579 --> 01:12:49,859
I'll take another Lord's rune.

1431
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,090
An easy 50k.

1432
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:56,149
Oh, another legendary hero's rune.

1433
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:57,779
Oh, boy.

1434
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,579
Todd, don't hit him.

1435
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,399
No, his name was Carl.

1436
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:07,560
That's the last thing he heard before he died, by the way.

1437
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,899
He's been practicing the trombone was me in his ear.

1438
01:13:11,899 --> 01:13:15,590
It was just mocking him.

1439
01:13:20,779 --> 01:13:21,739
That's so fucked up.

1440
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:27,659
That's a hard.

1441
01:13:27,659 --> 01:13:28,779
Yeah, it's a horrible way to go.

1442
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:38,569
I got a remembrance of the regal ancestor.

1443
01:13:38,569 --> 01:13:40,949
I'm going to hold on to it.

1444
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:47,220
I got a hero's rune level up.

1445
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,550
That's not enough.

1446
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,909
I wonder if these souls later.

1447
01:13:51,029 --> 01:13:51,750
Do you need some?

1448
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,659
I'm 15k more.

1449
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:58,819
I think I am willing to do something for you because I know that it's been a little rough.

1450
01:13:59,619 --> 01:14:00,260
Oh, God.

1451
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,739
And then like a week later, he comes back with like,

1452
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:06,090
remember that time that I gave you a Lord's rune?

1453
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:08,250
Hey, remember on stream that time I gave you the Lord's rune?

1454
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,970
And then he asked me to do something wicked.

1455
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:11,770
Yeah.

1456
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,729
Freaked up.

1457
01:14:12,729 --> 01:14:12,970
Yeah.

1458
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,090
But I mean, I know I'm a little bit higher than you.

1459
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:22,149
I feel like you should have that level up a couple of times.

1460
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,630
Okay.

1461
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,989
Just trying to do a good thing.

1462
01:14:23,989 --> 01:14:26,069
Just worried about what this is going to cost me.

1463
01:14:26,069 --> 01:14:26,789
Just don't forget.

1464
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:29,029
Don't forget what I did.

1465
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:29,590
Right?

1466
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,470
Yeah, I know you won't.

1467
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:31,270
I'll make sure you don't.

1468
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:35,590
I mean, I think I left my souls from that jump.

1469
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:38,149
I don't even I don't want to think about it.

1470
01:14:38,869 --> 01:14:47,659
What level are you after this?

1471
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:48,159
15.

1472
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,489
Be so bad.

1473
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:55,020
Don't you start at like level 15?

1474
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,939
You're not supposed to be 15 at this point in the game.

1475
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:59,420
I need like 200 souls.

1476
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:07,079
Just kill like one enemy.

1477
01:15:07,079 --> 01:15:08,520
You go back and kill Carl again.

1478
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:19,859
Nice.

1479
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:21,979
I got another sacred tear.

1480
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:25,260
That was also a hero's rune.

1481
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:26,619
Was it really?

1482
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:29,239
Maybe you can level up more than once.

1483
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,189
Foster tech.

1484
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:35,060
Thank you.

1485
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,899
Actually, did I go the wrong way?

1486
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:46,329
You got to go up upstairs.

1487
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:08,039
I opened something.

1488
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:08,760
I don't know.

1489
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,479
There was a lever.

1490
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:11,560
I've never played this game before.

1491
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:12,359
I don't know what that does.

1492
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:24,789
Okay, let's go.

1493
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:29,909
We can walk straight up to goad free or to what's this name?

1494
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,989
Good free.

1495
01:16:31,989 --> 01:16:32,550
Gurd free.

1496
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,430
What'd you say?

1497
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:35,350
Gertrude up in the top of the God free.

1498
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:39,260
Well, there's him and then there's the magical mystical man.

1499
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:42,340
Yes, Gertrude.

1500
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:07,640
Careful here.

1501
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,220
Will they beat Gertrude first try?

1502
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,180
Well, it depends who it is.

1503
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,380
It might not be Gertrude.

1504
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:19,609
It might be like it might be like fucking Placidusix again.

1505
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:24,520
I hope it's not something bad because this room is very, very small.

1506
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:25,000
Isn't it?

1507
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,760
And we could get absolutely screwed here.

1508
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,020
Legendary over there.

1509
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,880
I have to get that could be a Lord's room.

1510
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,699
Where?

1511
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:40,520
Where that guy's hanging over there.

1512
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:42,760
Watch out.

1513
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,039
We got a plant on the tree.

1514
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:44,920
Yeah, we do.

1515
01:17:50,149 --> 01:17:51,989
Okay, that's a lot of health.

1516
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:54,550
Wait.

1517
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,939
I don't think plants have blood.

1518
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,300
Yes, they do.

1519
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,500
It's called chlorophyll.

1520
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:01,960
Let's just go.

1521
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:24,020
Please.

1522
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:25,939
I would do not dodge here.

1523
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:34,140
I would just hold you right up.

1524
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:34,460
Nice.

1525
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,670
That's dangerous to do up here.

1526
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:44,710
That's a lot of confidence.

1527
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:50,949
Can you imagine staring this down and going?

1528
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:54,390
Yeah, I think I'll do 10 cartwheels in a row down this.

1529
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:56,949
That's not a good idea.

1530
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:01,300
Hold on.

1531
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,180
I want to get this item.

1532
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:06,100
Yeah, I want to get it too because my items can be better than your item.

1533
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,300
I bet you $100.

1534
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:08,260
Mine is better than yours.

1535
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:08,739
All right, fine.

1536
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,619
Whatever item this is like rarity or quality, like just quality.

1537
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,220
Just like whatever it is like an opinion.

1538
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,020
Mine's way better.

1539
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:18,579
Mine.

1540
01:19:18,579 --> 01:19:19,140
No, it's not.

1541
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:21,539
I just got Flame of the Fel God.

1542
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,310
Legendary spell.

1543
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:29,130
I got the remembrance of a fucking Godwin.

1544
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:37,590
I kind of want to just do like 90 faith and just do all these wacky ass spells.

1545
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:48,060
I think that still fits with me strong character arc.

1546
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:51,260
If he just throws like raging fireballs, you know what I mean?

1547
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,539
He's just like angry.

1548
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:53,739
Me rage.

1549
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:54,859
There's a dragon in here.

1550
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,060
No, what dragon is it?

1551
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:01,260
Red.

1552
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:03,819
Red.

1553
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,909
It's a red dragon, man.

1554
01:20:07,989 --> 01:20:09,189
It's the lich dragon.

1555
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:12,260
What the fuck?

1556
01:20:12,819 --> 01:20:14,020
I don't know what that is.

1557
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:14,899
Neither do I.

1558
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:17,779
I feel like I said it with a lot of with nervousness.

1559
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,260
Oh, for the sacks.

1560
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,300
First Elden Lord.

1561
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:39,050
Oh, he has that.

1562
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:39,689
I've never had.

1563
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:42,649
I've never done this fight because I've never played this game before.

1564
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,090
This is my first time playing Elden Ring.

1565
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,369
Why would they put a dragon in this room?

1566
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:46,810
Miyazaki, you're fucking wild.

1567
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:47,210
I don't know.

1568
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,810
It's actually not that big of a deal.

1569
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:53,210
It's like, okay, as long as it doesn't do anything else.

1570
01:20:54,010 --> 01:21:01,420
There's just kind of shit everywhere, though.

1571
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:10,140
Oh, God.

1572
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,500
Oh, God.

1573
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:24,460
It's really it's just kind of a mess.

1574
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:26,619
But as long as we it's not killing us too hard.

1575
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:30,170
That's a lot of damage.

1576
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:37,689
Um, it's on the top row.

1577
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,000
Off the top rope.

1578
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:43,770
The Huracan Arana.

1579
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,090
He's got like, oh, shit, the music is playing.

1580
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:46,890
I'm going to get down there.

1581
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,779
No, my big entrance.

1582
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:52,409
They're going to think I'm such a dork.

1583
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:59,979
Get down here.

1584
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:07,699
This dragon sucks at this game.

1585
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,729
We got to like, get in there and get some hits in.

1586
01:22:17,449 --> 01:22:37,300
Okay, he's in the dome.

1587
01:22:37,859 --> 01:22:47,590
Oh, that he just hit his neck on the top.

1588
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:53,479
You just went like, that probably hurts so bad.

1589
01:22:53,479 --> 01:22:56,039
He is he is doing a good job hiding how bad that hurt.

1590
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:59,449
Y'all just keep fighting like it's normal.

1591
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:02,090
That's like a oh, dude, are you all right, man?

1592
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:04,090
Yeah, I'm okay.

1593
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:04,970
I'm all right.

1594
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:05,289
I don't know.

1595
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:06,409
That looks really bad.

1596
01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:06,810
No, I'm good.

1597
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:07,130
I'm good.

1598
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,010
I'm good.

1599
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,569
It's like we do you want to go to like a doctor or something?

1600
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:27,909
It's so hard to see right now.

1601
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:30,949
He is having the reverse problem that we have.

1602
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:33,670
He is complaining on his stream right now.

1603
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:35,430
It's so fucking stupid.

1604
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,550
How am I supposed to fight these cases?

1605
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,390
Little these little ants in this room.

1606
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:39,590
I can't even fit in here.

1607
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:42,069
This randomizer is so bad.

1608
01:23:42,869 --> 01:23:44,779
How are you expected to actually do this?

1609
01:23:45,579 --> 01:23:48,939
Look, I can't even fit up here.

1610
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:50,380
Fucking game is so stupid.

1611
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:57,189
Actually, I heard a lot.

1612
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:11,529
I mean, I'm concerned for my life, but I think you got him.

1613
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,930
Kind of got me in the corner.

1614
01:24:14,409 --> 01:24:18,229
He's dead in three, two, one.

1615
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:21,140
Got it.

1616
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:24,819
Sacred tear.

1617
01:24:24,819 --> 01:24:25,300
Finally.

1618
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:26,899
I've been needing one.

1619
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,850
Oh, Bordasax just went offline.

1620
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,529
Is his offline screens up?

1621
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,750
Oh, he'll be back.

1622
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:41,430
Can somebody go into his chat and just be like, I don't know.

1623
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:43,640
We were just like fucking around.

1624
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:48,979
I kind of feel bad though, because he was he's probably pissed.

1625
01:24:48,979 --> 01:24:49,380
Hold on.

1626
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,460
I'll see if he's I'm in his discord.

1627
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,479
I'm going to say like get owned in his discord.

1628
01:24:53,479 --> 01:24:55,159
Don't don't be an idiot.

1629
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:05,500
I got 100,000 souls.

1630
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,380
Hold on.

1631
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,779
Wait, you level in this game?

1632
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:14,779
I totally was just walking away.

1633
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,579
I feel like I'm just going endurance, whatever.

1634
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:21,180
You know, in like the hour that we've not been fighting millennia,

1635
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,819
I have actually leveled like six or seven times.

1636
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:27,510
You have not?

1637
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,789
No, I've leveled like eight times.

1638
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:34,149
All we had to do is like not fight millennia for like a little bit.

1639
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,470
I know.

1640
01:25:35,479 --> 01:25:38,600
I'm so glad that after that first attempt that I just started,

1641
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,680
you could just tell I was already annoyed.

1642
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:43,930
I think it was already it was already going poorly.

1643
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:47,159
And I'm so glad we just pulled the plug.

1644
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:48,039
Get in the bowl.

1645
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:58,310
They're not that Fortisax is going to open my stream

1646
01:25:58,310 --> 01:26:00,869
and he's going to think we're like beaming him by like jumping around and shit.

1647
01:26:01,859 --> 01:26:03,939
Okay, just play it like just play normally.

1648
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:06,659
Don't like if he's watching, I don't want to be like, I don't know.

1649
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:08,020
He's fucking huge, man.

1650
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:12,260
I mean, if if someone like I don't even this scenario, this joke is weird.

1651
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:15,380
But if someone beat you so bad that you turned off your stream,

1652
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,579
would you sit there seizing in anger, open up their stream?

1653
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,460
Like like, fuck this, I'm done.

1654
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:24,779
And then then like watch their stream.

1655
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:25,340
You know what?

1656
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,550
Probably what you okay.

1657
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,430
Look, if you were like fighting and you knew it was like two other streamers

1658
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:34,550
and they were like, oh, yeah, Fortisax, we fucking got your ass.

1659
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:35,350
You know what I mean?

1660
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:36,149
You don't think you'd wait.

1661
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:38,539
You'd watch me like, what the fuck are they saying now?

1662
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:39,899
If what are they saying now?

1663
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:42,710
Defeat it that you turn off your own stream.

1664
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:44,310
I feel like you need to get out of the room.

1665
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:45,989
Like you've already lost.

1666
01:26:45,989 --> 01:26:46,949
Yeah, you've already lost.

1667
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:01,609
Do you want more memory slots?

1668
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:02,649
Do I?

1669
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:03,289
Yes.

1670
01:27:03,289 --> 01:27:04,569
Do you want like more spell slots?

1671
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:07,369
I know you keep saying I don't use spells.

1672
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:08,729
No, I'm good.

1673
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:11,380
I don't know what happened on my memory slots.

1674
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,779
I think when I respect, I lost a lot of them

1675
01:27:13,779 --> 01:27:16,409
because I had like two full rows.

1676
01:27:16,409 --> 01:27:17,770
I kept getting them.

1677
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:22,649
But now I've got like five slots.

1678
01:27:22,649 --> 01:27:24,329
Oh, dude, Fortisax raid.

1679
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:25,609
Seven.

1680
01:27:25,609 --> 01:27:28,310
What's up Fortisax?

1681
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,869
Thanks for the raid.

1682
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,310
I mean, I know what you were just doing.

1683
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:32,470
Appreciate the raid though.

1684
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,140
Okay, let's go.

1685
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:42,390
Boss, ignore Fortisax.

1686
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:52,279
All right, so what's in here besides Bogot?

1687
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:52,680
I see.

1688
01:27:53,479 --> 01:27:55,319
You know what's in there?

1689
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:56,119
I know it's in there

1690
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:58,760
and you're going to want to equip your Rikard bike.

1691
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:01,880
My Rikard bike?

1692
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,760
The pike, the spear that he gives you.

1693
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:11,079
Oh, does that mean that Rikard is in here?

1694
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:11,960
Yeah.

1695
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,079
Okay.

1696
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:14,359
I think it only worked for one of us.

1697
01:28:14,359 --> 01:28:15,159
So you go in first.

1698
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,949
It appears to be his stage two.

1699
01:28:22,949 --> 01:28:23,989
It's stage two.

1700
01:28:23,989 --> 01:28:33,000
Wait a minute.

1701
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,279
Ah, it's the regular cutscene.

1702
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,970
Lame.

1703
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:38,810
I just want to hear him say together.

1704
01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:42,010
Oh, this is a small arena for him.

1705
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:53,750
Yep, it is very easy.

1706
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:56,840
I don't think I can help.

1707
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,340
I need we do this again.

1708
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,939
I'm going to have to do more man of flasks.

1709
01:29:06,579 --> 01:29:08,760
What is happening?

1710
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:12,739
I don't know.

1711
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:13,460
He's swinging at me.

1712
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,979
Shit.

1713
01:29:15,979 --> 01:29:16,380
Rones.

1714
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,430
Wait, what?

1715
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,430
Oh, it's Morgoth talking.

1716
01:29:22,939 --> 01:29:25,420
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

1717
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,260
It's like Morgoth went to phase two.

1718
01:29:28,859 --> 01:29:33,140
What's that?

1719
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,180
Is there a car driving?

1720
01:29:35,909 --> 01:29:36,630
Yes.

1721
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:37,350
What is that?

1722
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:38,550
Was there a car?

1723
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:39,829
There's a motorbike on the highway.

1724
01:29:41,029 --> 01:29:41,350
Wait, no.

1725
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:42,630
Is that from your room?

1726
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:44,409
No.

1727
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:46,550
What the hell was that?

1728
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,430
That was in the game?

1729
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,550
No, it was not.

1730
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:49,270
Yes, it was.

1731
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,699
I'm going to die.

1732
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:08,970
Oh, fuck.

1733
01:30:09,689 --> 01:30:10,729
Oh, wait.

1734
01:30:10,729 --> 01:30:11,289
He does this thing.

1735
01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:17,819
All right.

1736
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:19,979
He's dead in three, two, one.

1737
01:30:19,979 --> 01:30:21,189
Nice.

1738
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:23,260
Yippee.

1739
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,029
Yeah.

1740
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:30,550
Two sacred tears and Godric's great run.

1741
01:30:32,789 --> 01:30:33,510
Oh, really?

1742
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:35,529
Oh, really?

1743
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:36,250
That's pretty sick.

1744
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:37,529
That is sick.

1745
01:30:38,409 --> 01:30:42,810
When I was walking up to this for the first time

1746
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:43,689
and just looking at this shit

1747
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:46,329
and I was like, oh, my God, I'm going in the room.

1748
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:46,810
It was like.

1749
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:48,010
Jebaited.

1750
01:30:48,729 --> 01:30:52,859
I was like, oh, my God.

1751
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,789
What?

1752
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:08,310
What?

1753
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,270
You can't get in the urn tree.

1754
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:11,029
Oh, my God.

1755
01:31:11,029 --> 01:31:12,310
It would have been funny if this was DLC.

1756
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,369
They just didn't do anything with it.

1757
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,210
It was like that would not be funny.

1758
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:20,649
That would be actually really infuriating.

1759
01:31:26,619 --> 01:31:27,739
And it's paid DLC.

1760
01:31:35,029 --> 01:31:35,350
Hello.

1761
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:37,109
Old friend.

1762
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:41,189
I got the animation like she appeared, but she's not here.

1763
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:43,029
You probably I'll just stand up and do it.

1764
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:54,550
Are we supposed to get something important here?

1765
01:31:55,899 --> 01:31:57,020
She gave me a cookbook.

1766
01:31:58,439 --> 01:31:58,920
I think.

1767
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,939
Huh.

1768
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:06,579
Isn't this where she tells you that like she wants to fucking smoke up?

1769
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:11,340
It's the the medallion.

1770
01:32:13,609 --> 01:32:16,300
Oh, the medallion.

1771
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:16,859
What do we do?

1772
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,220
What medallion?

1773
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,199
The rolled medallion to get up.

1774
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:23,079
I have a full one.

1775
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:23,720
You have it.

1776
01:32:24,279 --> 01:32:24,520
Yeah.

1777
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:30,250
Yeah.

1778
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,409
I got that like really early on on the first day.

1779
01:32:32,409 --> 01:32:33,689
I completed the whole medallion.

1780
01:32:33,689 --> 01:32:34,250
Thank goodness.

1781
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:38,340
She gave me a member.

1782
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:39,619
Everyone's giving me golden seeds.

1783
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:40,899
She's like here.

1784
01:32:40,899 --> 01:32:41,699
I don't know.

1785
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:42,100
All of it.

1786
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,300
We all have plenty of these.

1787
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:57,210
Can we go to God Rick's tower so I can get the great rune?

1788
01:32:58,090 --> 01:32:58,810
Yes.

1789
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:04,489
I believe it is.

1790
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:05,369
It must be this one.

1791
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:10,520
It's the one in the castle is God Rick, right?

1792
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:16,470
Why can't I travel not travel to a site of grace right now?

1793
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:16,869
Why not?

1794
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:21,859
If I can.

1795
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,920
I don't know.

1796
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:25,640
Why can I?

1797
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,960
If it's multiple pieces, you have the wrong medallion.

1798
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:38,520
Is it was it multiple pieces?

1799
01:33:39,159 --> 01:33:42,199
I'm not sure.

1800
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:42,520
Hold on.

1801
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:48,600
I'm looking what I have buried deep within my inventory.

1802
01:33:56,949 --> 01:33:59,510
World medallion operates the grand lift of rolled.

1803
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,989
There you go.

1804
01:34:01,859 --> 01:34:05,539
I think I might have just thought it was two pieces because it is split in half.

1805
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:06,659
Like the image of it.

1806
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:10,170
I just destroyed it.

1807
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:10,970
I didn't mean to do that.

1808
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:11,689
I sit on it.

1809
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,899
I think I just assumed it was pieces.

1810
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:21,750
So I am you got to talk to the corpse.

1811
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:23,640
I did.

1812
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,840
But I can't go anywhere.

1813
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:31,829
I have to check the thorns though.

1814
01:34:35,479 --> 01:34:37,479
Oh, did you not like talk to the thorns?

1815
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:39,300
Maybe that's what it is.

1816
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,590
Technically, I guess.

1817
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:45,140
No, those thorns are lonely.

1818
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:45,939
It's a known bug.

1819
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:46,979
You have to you have to separate.

1820
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:48,739
We have to separate.

1821
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:51,399
I banish me.

1822
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:52,920
Banish me now.

1823
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:59,609
And hey, before you go, drop that larval tear on the ground.

1824
01:34:59,609 --> 01:35:28,250
If you would, you can come back to my world and get it.

1825
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:31,930
If you fucking grovel a little bit, the game crashed.

1826
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,970
I think it was.

1827
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,890
I think my game was probably waiting to crash.

1828
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:39,880
So it was just like, hold on, hold on momentarily.

1829
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,640
I'm just going to walk up to the tower.

1830
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:44,439
I don't know if you'd like you get items here too.

1831
01:35:44,439 --> 01:35:45,399
Or if you can even come.

1832
01:35:49,029 --> 01:35:50,630
Okay, he's going to go.

1833
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,829
He's going to go pee.

1834
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:54,579
Okay, you're definitely going to want to mute then

1835
01:35:54,579 --> 01:35:56,260
because I'm going to go off on a tangent.

1836
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,520
I'm back to me is where he walks away to, you know,

1837
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,199
just be as weird as possible.

1838
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:17,239
I am.

1839
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:17,560
I'm good.

1840
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:18,680
I made sure to be very quick.

1841
01:37:20,539 --> 01:37:21,899
But wow, you can do that.

1842
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:25,510
You can you sacrificed your bathroom time for me.

1843
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:26,470
Well, I don't know.

1844
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,149
I just we didn't stand up for eight hours yesterday.

1845
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:32,789
And I kind of want to make sure every like couple hours,

1846
01:37:32,789 --> 01:37:33,510
like I get up.

1847
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:41,560
That's valid and based.

1848
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:42,439
Yeah.

1849
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:42,760
All right.

1850
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:50,020
Somebody says a crazy.

1851
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:53,270
All right, so let me open my game again.

1852
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,279
What's better, Bloodborne or Elden Ring?

1853
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:11,449
Elden Ring is probably the best single player experience

1854
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:13,609
I've probably had in a long time.

1855
01:38:14,170 --> 01:38:16,489
It's hard to compare them because they're almost what?

1856
01:38:16,489 --> 01:38:19,260
Almost full of 10 years apart.

1857
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,670
It's difficult to say and it's hard to do that.

1858
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:28,119
I think Elden Ring is I think Elden Ring is probably better,

1859
01:38:28,119 --> 01:38:30,760
but it's just newer and there's more shit in it.

1860
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,500
It's hard to say.

1861
01:38:32,619 --> 01:38:33,739
My Dark Souls 2 argument.

1862
01:38:33,739 --> 01:38:36,890
There's just more shit.

1863
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:43,109
It'd be nice if there was more Bloodborne.

1864
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:47,100
Okay, I let me bring this back.

1865
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:51,510
You should be able to see.

1866
01:38:52,229 --> 01:38:53,270
Yes, you can.

1867
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,670
Okay.

1868
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:54,789
All right.

1869
01:38:54,789 --> 01:38:55,270
Can you see?

1870
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:59,220
All right, I'm going to.

1871
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:00,260
Do you have your thing on?

1872
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:02,899
Do I?

1873
01:39:06,329 --> 01:39:08,170
Maybe the 30 FPS cap.

1874
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:16,630
Yeah, it's that's probably the only thing holding that back at this point.

1875
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:21,260
I have a feeling deep in my soul,

1876
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,619
even for reasons I've told you,

1877
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:27,689
but can't say that they're waiting for something for Bloodborne.

1878
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:31,850
Like like some like Demon's Souls remaster treatment or something.

1879
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:35,529
If they do, if they did the Demon's Souls remake,

1880
01:39:35,529 --> 01:39:38,329
you have to assume that Bloodborne will get maybe.

1881
01:39:38,329 --> 01:39:38,810
I don't know.

1882
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:41,590
I feel like is it one of those scenarios where

1883
01:39:41,590 --> 01:39:43,750
like they coded it to a point where it's like,

1884
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:46,069
well, we kind of can't do anything about this.

1885
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:48,789
It's just this is the game.

1886
01:39:48,789 --> 01:39:49,510
I doubt it.

1887
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:52,630
When Demon's Souls got like how good that remaster is

1888
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,909
and how old Demon's Souls is.

1889
01:39:53,909 --> 01:39:55,829
But Demon's the Demon's Souls remaster

1890
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:59,350
was like a complete 100% remake of the entire game.

1891
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:02,229
It wasn't like a HD texture pack.

1892
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:04,869
I never got to play it because I don't have a PS5.

1893
01:40:04,869 --> 01:40:05,829
I neither.

1894
01:40:05,829 --> 01:40:09,909
But that was a it was a complete they made the whole game over again.

1895
01:40:09,909 --> 01:40:18,949
So it's not like a Dark Souls remastered kind of scenario.

1896
01:40:18,949 --> 01:40:20,470
I sure you know what?

1897
01:40:21,029 --> 01:40:26,060
When I'm 80 years old and all the lawsuits have caught up with me

1898
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,100
and I'm on my deathbed,

1899
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,859
I really hope there's more Bloodborne content.

1900
01:40:30,710 --> 01:40:33,909
You're just riddled in lawsuits and you're 80.

1901
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:41,930
Isn't there somebody on this bridge usually?

1902
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:47,659
Two giants and at the end of this bridge.

1903
01:40:47,659 --> 01:40:50,140
No, it's just a really, really long bridge.

1904
01:40:50,140 --> 01:41:10,619
I will go down and say the old hunters is the best DLC

1905
01:41:10,619 --> 01:41:11,659
in any from software game.

1906
01:41:15,829 --> 01:41:16,310
Okay.

1907
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:16,789
Yeah.

1908
01:41:16,789 --> 01:41:17,029
Yeah.

1909
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:17,829
Yeah.

1910
01:41:17,829 --> 01:41:19,819
Yeah.

1911
01:41:19,819 --> 01:41:20,140
Yeah.

1912
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:20,380
Yeah.

1913
01:41:20,380 --> 01:41:20,859
Sure.

1914
01:41:20,859 --> 01:41:21,100
Yeah.

1915
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:21,420
All right.

1916
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:21,739
Okay.

1917
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:29,939
Isn't there some weird stuff with one of these?

1918
01:41:30,579 --> 01:41:32,100
You go there's a boss like in this.

1919
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,619
You go all the way down or something.

1920
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:33,859
Yeah.

1921
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:36,100
You like you travel across one of the bridges

1922
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,619
and your whole screen turns black

1923
01:41:37,619 --> 01:41:39,300
and you fight like two of the Omen people.

1924
01:41:40,649 --> 01:41:42,010
That is what happens.

1925
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:42,489
Right.

1926
01:41:42,489 --> 01:41:42,729
Okay.

1927
01:41:43,369 --> 01:41:51,770
The ring city was pretty good.

1928
01:41:54,619 --> 01:41:54,939
Yeah.

1929
01:41:54,939 --> 01:41:56,619
But I think as a whole.

1930
01:41:56,619 --> 01:41:56,939
Okay.

1931
01:41:56,939 --> 01:41:59,180
Wait, what's the the Bloodborne boss's name

1932
01:41:59,180 --> 01:41:59,979
in the clock tower?

1933
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,460
You know, you know the one Maria.

1934
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:08,699
Yeah.

1935
01:42:08,699 --> 01:42:12,539
Maria is if like millennia wasn't dog shit.

1936
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:16,729
It's like they wanted to do Maria again

1937
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:18,329
because people really liked her

1938
01:42:18,329 --> 01:42:19,369
and then they put her in a game

1939
01:42:19,369 --> 01:42:21,130
where you can't actually dodge that quickly.

1940
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:33,909
Okay.

1941
01:42:33,909 --> 01:42:34,550
Real question.

1942
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:37,270
Real question before I restore the power of the great run.

1943
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:37,510
Yes.

1944
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:39,829
You're in the Elden Ring universe

1945
01:42:39,829 --> 01:42:41,189
and you come up here in the two fingers here

1946
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:42,390
and it's this holy dude.

1947
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:43,750
Look how holy this shit is.

1948
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:46,630
You think you would take a bite?

1949
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,390
No, because that would be disrespecting

1950
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:49,590
this holy thing

1951
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,029
and that would be a complete disrespect

1952
01:42:51,029 --> 01:42:53,750
that it would be what do you think you're doing?

1953
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,149
You see you see like the the ripped up.

1954
01:42:56,149 --> 01:43:00,100
It's kind of like it's kind of like bark like tree.

1955
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,220
Get it tree fingers.

1956
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,359
Hold on.

1957
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:06,279
Honestly, like I think you just kind of

1958
01:43:06,279 --> 01:43:08,180
said something really profound.

1959
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,979
Hold on.

1960
01:43:08,979 --> 01:43:11,689
It is like tree.

1961
01:43:11,689 --> 01:43:12,729
It is like a tree bark.

1962
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:22,060
Yeah, tree fingers.

1963
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:22,779
It's a tree.

1964
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:36,569
Get fatty on the phone immediately.

1965
01:43:36,569 --> 01:43:37,369
Okay, where are we going?

1966
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,579
We can go.

1967
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:53,479
So we you have the medallion.

1968
01:43:53,479 --> 01:43:54,810
Here are your options.

1969
01:43:54,810 --> 01:43:55,689
Medallion of rolled.

1970
01:43:55,689 --> 01:43:56,250
Yeah.

1971
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:00,520
We can do the weird upside down area.

1972
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:00,920
Okay.

1973
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,600
With you know you I have that item.

1974
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:07,260
We can put the time thing and it goes upside down.

1975
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:07,979
You can do that.

1976
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:08,220
Yes.

1977
01:44:08,779 --> 01:44:09,930
Yes.

1978
01:44:09,930 --> 01:44:11,689
We could we could go in.

1979
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:12,649
I want to hear option two.

1980
01:44:12,649 --> 01:44:14,090
We could go in and and fight.

1981
01:44:15,289 --> 01:44:16,010
You know what I mean?

1982
01:44:16,010 --> 01:44:16,569
We could do that.

1983
01:44:17,050 --> 01:44:20,420
But I mean that that's a possibility.

1984
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,899
We could go do the medallion.

1985
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:28,180
Or we can go to the upside down.

1986
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:35,500
Medallion upside down world or and we're not doing that one because it's not.

1987
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,340
Okay, upside down vote.

1988
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,619
My vote has been in.

1989
01:44:39,619 --> 01:44:41,479
You're voting for upside down world.

1990
01:44:41,479 --> 01:44:43,979
Yeah.

1991
01:44:43,979 --> 01:44:51,619
Okay, so then we have to go to lake facing cliffs and go from there, right?

1992
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:54,229
I think pretty far ride.

1993
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:57,020
That's a pretty far ride.

1994
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:00,460
Oh, we could go down into the shining grounds sewers.

1995
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,630
That's where Mog is.

1996
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:10,939
That's great for Mog.

1997
01:45:10,939 --> 01:45:13,260
Isn't there a place further up where we can?

1998
01:45:13,819 --> 01:45:14,619
That's a fake Mog.

1999
01:45:14,619 --> 01:45:17,609
But yeah, what's your question?

2000
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:21,399
I don't know if we have to go this far back.

2001
01:45:24,409 --> 01:45:24,890
I don't know.

2002
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:25,609
I'm going to follow you.

2003
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:30,020
Take the wheels.

2004
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:33,939
Somebody's name is gaming dragon Fortisacs.

2005
01:45:33,939 --> 01:45:40,539
I think they're trying to tap into that market there.

2006
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:43,079
All right.

2007
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:45,319
So we need to find a way to go like here.

2008
01:45:45,319 --> 01:45:48,180
I don't know about you, but I have a lot of Fortisacs.

2009
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:56,119
Trying to figure out what you are saying right now.

2010
01:45:56,119 --> 01:46:01,819
We need to go down that way.

2011
01:46:01,819 --> 01:46:04,779
What does he mean?

2012
01:46:04,779 --> 01:46:05,579
What do you mean?

2013
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:07,100
No, don't even explain it.

2014
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,319
You gotta be honest.

2015
01:46:09,319 --> 01:46:10,279
I don't really know.

2016
01:46:10,279 --> 01:46:12,119
I think it's open to interpretation.

2017
01:46:13,369 --> 01:46:14,170
Did I go the wrong?

2018
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:15,689
Like, we're not supposed to go this way.

2019
01:46:15,689 --> 01:46:18,970
I'm trying to find like we need to go down there.

2020
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:20,380
How do you get down there?

2021
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:23,739
The edge of the cliff that way.

2022
01:46:23,739 --> 01:46:27,420
There's a whole bunch of those things on the wall that you can jump down.

2023
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:28,539
Is there?

2024
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:31,979
Yeah, there's some cliff side of wall jumps there.

2025
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:32,939
Yes.

2026
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,239
God.

2027
01:46:35,239 --> 01:46:35,640
Listen.

2028
01:46:36,869 --> 01:46:37,510
Listen.

2029
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:38,310
They won't.

2030
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:39,350
They won't leave me alone.

2031
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:45,369
So am I going the wrong way or are you going the wrong way?

2032
01:46:45,369 --> 01:46:47,399
I don't even know where you're going.

2033
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:52,760
I'm trying to go down here like to get to where.

2034
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,479
Well, I mean, like I would we go this far apart?

2035
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:56,439
We do think so much.

2036
01:46:56,439 --> 01:46:57,880
I don't know where you actually are.

2037
01:46:58,439 --> 01:46:58,680
All right.

2038
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,520
We need to just get back together again.

2039
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,699
Helen, we just you've gone too far.

2040
01:47:04,699 --> 01:47:05,100
I'm coming.

2041
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,500
I'm coming.

2042
01:47:06,460 --> 01:47:08,140
I thought there was a different way to get down here.

2043
01:47:08,859 --> 01:47:09,340
Coming back.

2044
01:47:09,979 --> 01:47:10,859
You've gone too far.

2045
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:18,979
It's these like sideways tombstones right here.

2046
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:32,539
I wanted you to think I was jumping off.

2047
01:47:34,069 --> 01:47:34,949
Well, that's what you got to do.

2048
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:37,739
I freaked out.

2049
01:47:41,859 --> 01:47:42,500
Nice joke.

2050
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:43,859
I freaked.

2051
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:45,939
I didn't I knew I wasn't going to make the second jump.

2052
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:48,119
And I was like, fuck, I have to double jump.

2053
01:47:48,119 --> 01:47:51,000
But I don't want to double jump too far because I'll go over the tombstone.

2054
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,680
I've done enough of those jokes today.

2055
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:53,180
No.

2056
01:48:03,319 --> 01:48:04,359
Well, we can work.

2057
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:08,199
There's a bonfire here if you can't handle those jumps.

2058
01:48:08,199 --> 01:48:08,699
I can.

2059
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:14,539
I don't know.

2060
01:48:14,539 --> 01:48:15,020
I don't know.

2061
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,380
I don't know if you're going to handle these jumps.

2062
01:48:16,939 --> 01:48:20,479
Well, I just did something to say.

2063
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,119
King me.

2064
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:31,550
OK, so there's actually a lot of random shit we could do here.

2065
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:32,890
We could do this.

2066
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:34,890
I think there's probably there's a jail here, too, isn't there?

2067
01:48:34,890 --> 01:48:35,390
Yes.

2068
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,130
Do you know what's crazy about our playthrough is that this game is so giant.

2069
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:41,369
We keep talking about how giant and big this game is.

2070
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:45,609
And then it was also like, no, the only thing we get.

2071
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:47,289
The only thing we can do is millennia.

2072
01:48:47,289 --> 01:48:51,930
Well, we didn't have the key to the manor.

2073
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,449
We didn't have the two great ruins.

2074
01:48:53,449 --> 01:48:56,649
We kind of we could go this whole like this whole side path.

2075
01:48:56,649 --> 01:48:57,770
We didn't do any of this.

2076
01:48:57,770 --> 01:48:59,689
Yeah, but but game progress.

2077
01:48:59,689 --> 01:49:03,449
We were just beating our head against the wall trying to do game progress.

2078
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:04,250
I don't know.

2079
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,930
We made a lot of progress and we haven't killed her yet.

2080
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:09,930
Yeah, because we came progress because we got the two items.

2081
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:11,689
We needed to keep game progress going.

2082
01:49:12,569 --> 01:49:16,380
I don't know why you were convinced that millennia had those two items.

2083
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:21,399
No, it's true.

2084
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:24,159
Sensor him.

2085
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:27,689
Oh, fun.

2086
01:49:27,689 --> 01:49:27,930
Enemy.

2087
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:28,090
Fun.

2088
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:28,409
Enemy.

2089
01:49:31,529 --> 01:49:32,489
Dung eater puppet.

2090
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:35,930
One hit.

2091
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:50,590
OK, so let's check out this.

2092
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:54,109
There's a down by me left.

2093
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:55,789
There's some ruins.

2094
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:59,229
They might be a boss down underground in the purified ruins.

2095
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:01,960
Just grab in the moon fire.

2096
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:03,560
There's a legendary item here for me.

2097
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:05,770
Not for you.

2098
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:08,250
The teleporter in the chest up here in that tower.

2099
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:09,369
I don't remember where that takes you.

2100
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,060
You know what I'm talking about?

2101
01:50:12,699 --> 01:50:13,180
I think so.

2102
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:18,279
That's good.

2103
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:21,079
I actually don't have to have two acts of Godfrey's now.

2104
01:50:23,159 --> 01:50:23,399
No.

2105
01:50:24,039 --> 01:50:33,119
Oh, yes, I look over at chat when I pick up a legendary item

2106
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,159
to see how many fog champs there are to determine if I'm going to say,

2107
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,520
whoa, what the fuck is awesome?

2108
01:50:44,829 --> 01:50:51,039
Whoa, what the fuck?

2109
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:52,239
Margaret's shackle.

2110
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:56,359
What the hell is that at Margaret or Morgoth's fight?

2111
01:50:56,359 --> 01:51:00,119
If you use that item, it'll make Morgoth go.

2112
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
He'll slam into the ground for like five seconds.

2113
01:51:03,159 --> 01:51:05,720
Oh, so it's like in a Yasha when you say, sit, boy.

2114
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:19,579
Make it rain.

2115
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,140
The answer to that is yes, I think.

2116
01:51:25,369 --> 01:51:29,850
So do you think that that implies in the lore that Margaret is actually Isiakide?

2117
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:32,640
I think, I think.

2118
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,779
He's not, he's not from here.

2119
01:51:34,779 --> 01:51:35,899
Oh, okay.

2120
01:51:35,899 --> 01:51:36,300
All right.

2121
01:51:45,899 --> 01:51:46,859
I'm killing this.

2122
01:51:46,859 --> 01:51:47,340
I hate her.

2123
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,300
Oh.

2124
01:51:55,710 --> 01:52:01,079
Oh, no.

2125
01:52:01,079 --> 01:52:04,079
Can't lock on to her.

2126
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:15,869
Okay, now we're going to go over here.

2127
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:19,449
Is something else for us to look at?

2128
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:42,640
What is over here?

2129
01:52:46,489 --> 01:52:48,890
That's just, I can't get out of my head now.

2130
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:50,170
I just keep thinking about it.

2131
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:52,300
Isn't there something here?

2132
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,859
I'm really busting the lore down.

2133
01:52:55,659 --> 01:53:00,090
I just see it from a different angle.

2134
01:53:02,350 --> 01:53:03,229
What else is here?

2135
01:53:03,789 --> 01:53:07,159
Irma, why do you look like that?

2136
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:13,239
You know, people, people ask that and it's just like, I don't know, dude,

2137
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,760
my skin and muscle and sinew up here formed a person's face.

2138
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:23,479
I don't know.

2139
01:53:28,439 --> 01:53:30,119
Sounds like something an alien would say.

2140
01:53:32,619 --> 01:53:33,119
Bro.

2141
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,800
We got the Mariner.

2142
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:38,079
It's the Crucible Knight down here.

2143
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:44,619
What are the Mariners usually drop that you need?

2144
01:53:44,619 --> 01:53:45,500
What's their thing?

2145
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,220
Deathroot, I think.

2146
01:53:46,939 --> 01:53:50,699
I think they're one of the sources of Deathroot.

2147
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:53,319
Sounds right, dude.

2148
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,359
Dude, screw you.

2149
01:53:58,359 --> 01:53:59,319
You stink at this game.

2150
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:01,479
Distractive.

2151
01:54:02,039 --> 01:54:03,000
He is distracted.

2152
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:17,039
Why is my weapon not equipped?

2153
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:31,880
What a great enemy.

2154
01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:34,520
Three lumps of flesh.

2155
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:35,399
Let's fucking go.

2156
01:54:42,779 --> 01:54:43,579
Larval tear.

2157
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:45,600
Oh, cool.

2158
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:46,960
You don't need mine anymore.

2159
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:47,680
You mooch.

2160
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:54,600
Are you feeling okay?

2161
01:54:55,399 --> 01:54:55,640
Yes.

2162
01:54:59,100 --> 01:54:59,899
I thought of you today.

2163
01:54:59,899 --> 01:55:00,859
Spiked practice.

2164
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:07,420
In my Uber, the song What If God Was One Of Us was playing.

2165
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:13,739
And I never heard this lyric before, but it says a slob like one of us.

2166
01:55:14,539 --> 01:55:15,500
Yeah, it's.

2167
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,979
What if God was one of us?

2168
01:55:18,699 --> 01:55:21,340
Just a slob like one of us.

2169
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:23,899
I got the letter from Volcano Manor.

2170
01:55:23,899 --> 01:55:25,659
I don't know if that was something we needed.

2171
01:55:25,659 --> 01:55:28,640
I don't think so.

2172
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:35,390
I have enough to level up, I think.

2173
01:55:35,949 --> 01:55:39,439
I need one of those.

2174
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:41,520
I need to go back, look at remembrances,

2175
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,439
and I got to make a lot of decisions.

2176
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:51,119
Did you ever talk to the finger maiden next to the two fingers?

2177
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:51,760
Yes.

2178
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,109
Okay, because she does sell a bunch of stuff.

2179
01:55:54,109 --> 01:55:54,989
Yes, she does.

2180
01:55:54,989 --> 01:55:56,750
She sold some pretty good things to me.

2181
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:01,579
I kind of want to go to the upside down.

2182
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:02,619
Yeah.

2183
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,380
No, I'm going to disconnect you.

2184
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,260
I'm going to go get the waypoint.

2185
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:06,060
You go do your thing.

2186
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:06,859
All right, all right.

2187
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:09,819
Just boot me because I've got a major decision I have to make here.

2188
01:56:09,819 --> 01:56:10,859
I have banished you.

2189
01:56:10,859 --> 01:56:11,739
I'll see you in an hour.

2190
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:14,329
Chat.

2191
01:56:14,329 --> 01:56:14,970
I can't see.

2192
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:18,430
I don't know why I'm doing that today.

2193
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:18,989
I don't know.

2194
01:56:18,989 --> 01:56:19,789
I don't know.

2195
01:56:19,789 --> 01:56:27,100
But anyways, I'm going to make this decision one more time.

2196
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:32,000
I need to have the final build.

2197
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,149
And I genuinely don't know what that is.

2198
01:56:35,149 --> 01:56:37,869
I could dual weld the omen cleavers.

2199
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,319
God damn it.

2200
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:41,600
You know what?

2201
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,960
I'm just to make him feel better.

2202
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:44,880
Just hit me a few times.

2203
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:48,920
Oh, man.

2204
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:50,359
Almost got me.

2205
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:53,720
Oh, I did a lot of damage, but sorry.

2206
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:54,359
You're doing good, though.

2207
01:56:54,359 --> 01:56:55,000
You're doing pretty good.

2208
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:57,229
Watch it.

2209
01:56:59,210 --> 01:57:01,050
Oh, how'd you do that move?

2210
01:57:01,770 --> 01:57:04,079
You're pretty good at this game.

2211
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:11,930
All right.

2212
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:13,689
There's no more no more jokes.

2213
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:14,569
No more joking around.

2214
01:57:15,369 --> 01:57:19,640
No more jokes.

2215
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:20,520
You got to pick your belt.

2216
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,840
You got to pick your belt and see if you're going to dual weld.

2217
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:37,529
Two big hands jumping claw attacks.

2218
01:57:37,529 --> 01:57:39,449
I know it's really pretty good.

2219
01:57:39,449 --> 01:57:40,569
It's really good.

2220
01:57:40,569 --> 01:57:45,210
But are you a big enough man to do it?

2221
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:45,930
That's the question.

2222
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:47,689
The question is, what am I going to do?

2223
01:57:48,649 --> 01:57:53,399
Are you thick enough and tight enough?

2224
01:57:58,159 --> 01:57:58,640
I missed it.

2225
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:01,979
Missed it.

2226
01:58:01,979 --> 01:58:02,619
All right.

2227
01:58:06,649 --> 01:58:07,850
What a shitty thing.

2228
01:58:08,569 --> 01:58:08,890
What?

2229
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:17,720
Oh, you're going to have a recusant finger or a gold scarab.

2230
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:22,680
I don't know what you're doing, but it doesn't sound like you're respecting.

2231
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:26,279
I'm I took I have a remembrance and I'm just checking to see what they are.

2232
01:58:26,279 --> 01:58:29,239
And it's not remembrance weapon randomization.

2233
01:58:29,239 --> 01:58:31,000
It's any item randomization.

2234
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,119
Yeah.

2235
01:58:32,119 --> 01:58:39,159
The gold scarab, though, is this something that is I feel like that.

2236
01:58:39,159 --> 01:58:40,279
How good is that?

2237
01:58:40,279 --> 01:58:42,350
I should just take the scarab.

2238
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:47,930
But it's a talisman, right?

2239
01:58:47,930 --> 01:58:49,449
It's 20% more.

2240
01:58:55,630 --> 01:59:00,189
Is it more or additional because the more multipliers and not, you know what I'm saying?

2241
01:59:00,189 --> 01:59:08,380
Holy shit.

2242
01:59:08,380 --> 01:59:14,460
Somebody just called you a POE player.

2243
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:15,739
I am.

2244
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:18,380
Is that why you said that?

2245
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:19,659
That is why I said that.

2246
01:59:21,579 --> 01:59:24,300
It's very important if it's more or not.

2247
01:59:24,859 --> 01:59:31,310
You got to know that gaming.

2248
01:59:31,310 --> 01:59:32,539
All right.

2249
01:59:32,539 --> 01:59:33,979
What the heck am I going to do?

2250
01:59:34,699 --> 01:59:35,260
Let me look.

2251
01:59:35,899 --> 01:59:42,590
It's going to run around and pick up bonfires.

2252
01:59:42,590 --> 01:59:46,039
I'm going to do a poll because I want Chad to decide.

2253
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:53,359
We have three lights, inferno, crozier.

2254
01:59:53,359 --> 02:00:02,140
This is just a straight up just strength weapon.

2255
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:04,800
Big hammer.

2256
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,369
We also have I'm not going to put that on the list.

2257
02:00:07,369 --> 02:00:09,689
You'll pick it and it'll ruin my game.

2258
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:24,039
We have the double Omen killer swing dual weld double Omen killer.

2259
02:00:24,039 --> 02:00:46,619
We've got acts of Godfrey, the acts of Godfrey make you

2260
02:01:01,079 --> 02:01:29,119
You hear anything in music playing?

2261
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:34,590
Two big knives is funny, but also the acts of Godfrey.

2262
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:39,880
This could be funny too because I'll keep mispronouncing the name.

2263
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:47,050
I'm going to say like, oh, acts of goat fry and everyone's going to laugh.

2264
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,010
That's funny.

2265
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:58,880
I'll mispronounce it a few times.

2266
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,800
I can't alt tab because it might crash the game.

2267
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,159
So what's what is it up?

2268
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:14,329
Dude, Godfrey one.

2269
02:02:14,329 --> 02:02:15,130
Oh, shit.

2270
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:15,689
Cool.

2271
02:02:15,689 --> 02:02:19,600
What about the God Slayer colossal sword?

2272
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:32,909
You mean this thing that's like a deck strength.

2273
02:02:32,909 --> 02:02:34,109
They I don't know.

2274
02:02:34,109 --> 02:02:42,199
It's the best sword.

2275
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,579
Dual welding is up.

2276
02:02:45,579 --> 02:02:45,899
Okay.

2277
02:02:45,899 --> 02:02:46,939
So that's what we're doing.

2278
02:02:46,939 --> 02:02:53,560
Double Omen wins double Omen killers.

2279
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:54,359
Oh, shit.

2280
02:02:54,359 --> 02:02:55,000
All right.

2281
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:59,710
Okay, stir.

2282
02:02:59,710 --> 02:03:02,489
Let me get your opinion.

2283
02:03:02,489 --> 02:03:07,520
Yeah, your opinion is worth 5% of the vote that that honestly in the grand scheme of

2284
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,800
things is not much.

2285
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,640
That actually is it close.

2286
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:11,279
It's pretty close.

2287
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:18,560
Double Omen killer dual welding strong guy.

2288
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:23,229
If you do that, I'm going to vote against it.

2289
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:27,600
Like I want you to do that, but I'm going to vote against it if you keep saying dual welding.

2290
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:38,909
Like dual wielding great Omen killer cleaver acts of Godfrey.

2291
02:03:38,909 --> 02:03:40,590
Who the fuck is Godfrey?

2292
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:41,149
It's funny.

2293
02:03:41,949 --> 02:03:44,270
Oh, Godfrey, Godfrey, Godfrey.

2294
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:44,909
Okay.

2295
02:03:44,909 --> 02:03:46,750
Yeah.

2296
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:48,270
And what's special about that axe?

2297
02:03:48,270 --> 02:03:52,460
I said it kind of funnily.

2298
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:52,939
That's it.

2299
02:03:52,939 --> 02:03:54,970
That's the reason you want to use it.

2300
02:03:54,970 --> 02:04:01,279
Or the big red hammer.

2301
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:04,670
Oh, the charge one.

2302
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:05,310
Yes.

2303
02:04:05,310 --> 02:04:08,029
That one's kind of fun.

2304
02:04:08,029 --> 02:04:12,590
I think practically the Omen killers is going to be the strongest one.

2305
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:17,020
Okay, done.

2306
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:20,460
And I think when you fight millennia with jump attacks with those,

2307
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:23,979
you'll be happy to stick her face in the mud.

2308
02:04:23,979 --> 02:04:26,090
Oh, wow.

2309
02:04:26,090 --> 02:04:27,609
These look like two turkey legs.

2310
02:04:27,609 --> 02:04:27,930
All right.

2311
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:29,369
So are these somber?

2312
02:04:29,369 --> 02:04:30,250
I hope they're not.

2313
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:35,319
It's not.

2314
02:04:35,319 --> 02:04:35,720
Oh shit.

2315
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,800
I have to do it to both of them.

2316
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:38,359
Oh, no.

2317
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:43,949
Oh, no.

2318
02:04:43,949 --> 02:04:47,069
I've picked up a couple of sombers, but I need regular.

2319
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:51,319
Oh, then I can look and see what I got.

2320
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:55,550
Dude, I will trade you like all of my sombers because I'm not going to be using them anymore.

2321
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:59,000
You just have them all.

2322
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,359
If I can have all of yours.

2323
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:03,359
Dude, you are ruining the economy right now.

2324
02:05:03,359 --> 02:05:04,079
How many of these do I need?

2325
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:05,039
I need a lot of these.

2326
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:08,539
I was going to buy 200 of them.

2327
02:05:08,539 --> 02:05:11,680
I have one ancient.

2328
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:12,319
Okay.

2329
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:13,529
How many of these do I need?

2330
02:05:13,529 --> 02:05:15,050
I need 24 of these.

2331
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:18,319
Jesus.

2332
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:22,479
And I could potentially upgrade it for you because I only need one of each.

2333
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:24,239
And I need 24 of these.

2334
02:05:27,979 --> 02:05:28,539
Right.

2335
02:05:28,539 --> 02:05:31,199
I mean, no.

2336
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:32,430
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

2337
02:05:32,430 --> 02:05:32,909
What?

2338
02:05:32,909 --> 02:05:34,270
I need 12 of each.

2339
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:37,609
Why did you say 24?

2340
02:05:37,609 --> 02:05:39,289
A bunch of you said 24.

2341
02:05:39,289 --> 02:05:46,430
24 for both.

2342
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:47,390
That's what I mean.

2343
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:51,319
24 was correct.

2344
02:05:51,319 --> 02:05:52,279
Yeah, I was right.

2345
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:55,369
Why is everybody yelling at me?

2346
02:05:55,369 --> 02:05:56,880
It's 12 per weapon.

2347
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,640
Yeah, what are you guys talking about?

2348
02:05:58,640 --> 02:05:59,520
I had it right.

2349
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:29,789
Here we go.

2350
02:06:29,789 --> 02:06:31,869
Yeah, you should let me upgrade those.

2351
02:06:31,869 --> 02:06:43,119
So I need smithing stone threes now.

2352
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:45,869
I explained this early on.

2353
02:06:45,869 --> 02:06:50,430
This is like the one randomizer cheeto thing is that there's an option in the randomizer

2354
02:06:50,430 --> 02:06:52,890
to only need one stone per upgrade.

2355
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:54,329
And he has it and I don't.

2356
02:06:54,329 --> 02:07:03,800
Because I've played randomizer before and it was just looking for stones for eight hours

2357
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,369
and it was not fun.

2358
02:07:05,369 --> 02:07:12,250
What's the highest scaling thing that I have here?

2359
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:36,329
Fire, flaming strike, flaming the red mains, wild strikes and flame of roar.

2360
02:07:36,329 --> 02:07:38,970
Oh, because yeah, I see what you're saying.

2361
02:07:38,970 --> 02:07:42,409
Well, I just wasted like 30,000 souls for no reason.

2362
02:07:42,409 --> 02:07:49,880
So you could get these just to like plus 25 each.

2363
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:52,920
Yeah, if you have like I just need one of each stone per upgrade.

2364
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:56,039
So when it costs you six stones, it would cost me one.

2365
02:07:56,989 --> 02:07:58,079
Shit.

2366
02:07:58,079 --> 02:08:01,979
Okay, so I need so I could do one.

2367
02:08:01,979 --> 02:08:05,039
Do you have any smithing stone threes?

2368
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:06,560
I have like, yeah.

2369
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,479
We're not going to get in a position where this is going to completely screw me over

2370
02:08:10,479 --> 02:08:11,680
and I'm not going to be able to take them.

2371
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,750
What about the finger?

2372
02:08:14,750 --> 02:08:17,630
I have a plus 10 somber weapon.

2373
02:08:17,630 --> 02:08:20,729
Is that is that okay?

2374
02:08:20,729 --> 02:08:21,930
Honestly, I have no idea.

2375
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:23,529
I would assume so, but.

2376
02:08:23,529 --> 02:08:25,930
So if I I don't want to get this wrong.

2377
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:30,520
Because last time this all look, I got a plus 10 magma worm scale sword.

2378
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,810
That's okay, because I'm fine.

2379
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:36,140
Okay, I'm going to give you these both these weapons stir.

2380
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:38,140
Please get them both to plus 25.

2381
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,380
If you could.

2382
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:41,979
Okay, I only have one ancient.

2383
02:08:41,979 --> 02:08:43,880
Or just get one that would be the main hand.

2384
02:08:43,880 --> 02:08:44,840
I can get them pretty high.

2385
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:46,329
Yeah.

2386
02:08:46,329 --> 02:08:48,970
Okay, I duplicated my Eldenbeast remembrance.

2387
02:08:49,850 --> 02:08:53,770
So I'm going to use all my souls on your new company that you're launching

2388
02:08:53,770 --> 02:08:56,800
called Dual Welding Omen Killers.

2389
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,899
I thought you told me never to use that.

2390
02:08:59,899 --> 02:09:01,340
I thought you said, no, don't do that anymore.

2391
02:09:02,829 --> 02:09:05,119
I don't think you can stop.

2392
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:05,840
People are freaking out.

2393
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,520
They're saying don't you're going to lose them again.

2394
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:16,939
What's the real thing here?

2395
02:09:16,939 --> 02:09:19,100
Oh, do you have a plus 25?

2396
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:29,180
I double I double duplicated my Eldenbeast remembrance.

2397
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:39,210
I'm a double duper.

2398
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:39,930
This is good.

2399
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:42,079
I need a lot of endurance.

2400
02:09:42,079 --> 02:09:53,420
Go to at least 50 strength.

2401
02:09:53,420 --> 02:10:06,239
Is that okay?

2402
02:10:06,239 --> 02:10:08,510
50.

2403
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:10,270
It was 12 decks.

2404
02:10:10,270 --> 02:10:10,989
Put these on.

2405
02:10:10,989 --> 02:10:18,590
That should be okay.

2406
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:23,039
Do 26 endurance.

2407
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:23,920
20 endurance?

2408
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:24,399
No way.

2409
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:31,369
I think this is fine.

2410
02:10:31,369 --> 02:10:31,770
All right.

2411
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:35,390
We're in a good spot.

2412
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:48,090
Now I just need to upgrade these and I'm going to be

2413
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:50,569
I'm going to be an absolute slaughter.

2414
02:10:50,569 --> 02:10:59,899
Let me see what it looks like when I swing it.

2415
02:10:59,899 --> 02:11:00,699
Oh my goodness.

2416
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:03,289
Yes.

2417
02:11:06,010 --> 02:11:06,409
All right.

2418
02:11:06,409 --> 02:11:07,930
This is worth it now for sure.

2419
02:11:08,649 --> 02:11:10,829
Make sure the jump attack thing is on.

2420
02:11:11,470 --> 02:11:13,520
Apparently it didn't double duper.

2421
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:19,039
I need more talisman slots.

2422
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:29,550
Try higher poise armor if I have any.

2423
02:11:30,109 --> 02:11:36,079
Still in medium.

2424
02:11:43,229 --> 02:11:46,409
Man, I am making so much progress right now.

2425
02:11:46,409 --> 02:11:47,449
I'm glad.

2426
02:11:47,449 --> 02:11:48,329
It's actually good to hear.

2427
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:50,890
I am glad to hear that.

2428
02:11:50,890 --> 02:11:52,409
I am untethered.

2429
02:11:59,039 --> 02:11:59,760
That's heavy though.

2430
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:05,260
Look at me.

2431
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:21,390
All right, sir.

2432
02:12:21,390 --> 02:12:24,270
I am I'm ready for me to come to your world

2433
02:12:24,270 --> 02:12:27,789
for you to drop a plus 25 on the ground for me to see

2434
02:12:27,789 --> 02:12:30,750
if I can pick that plus 25 up off the ground

2435
02:12:30,750 --> 02:12:33,310
and then for you to then take my items

2436
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:36,510
upgrade them to plus 25 and then give them back

2437
02:12:36,510 --> 02:12:37,550
or at least 24.

2438
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:41,819
All right.

2439
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,359
You look nasty.

2440
02:12:45,359 --> 02:12:45,600
Yep.

2441
02:13:01,680 --> 02:13:13,210
Why don't you go to bird feeder on your head?

2442
02:13:13,210 --> 02:13:21,579
What's up, dude?

2443
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:24,729
Okay.

2444
02:13:24,729 --> 02:13:27,449
I am dropping you my only good weapon

2445
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:31,689
that I've been using all game to prove that you can see it.

2446
02:13:31,689 --> 02:13:33,289
To prove that I can pick it up off the ground.

2447
02:13:34,109 --> 02:13:35,470
And then you're not going to give it back.

2448
02:13:37,369 --> 02:13:38,489
I need some collateral.

2449
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:40,010
Just put it on the ground.

2450
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:50,840
There it is.

2451
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:51,399
Can you see it?

2452
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:52,439
You don't need to pick it up.

2453
02:13:52,439 --> 02:13:56,359
I can pick it up plus 25 magic long sword.

2454
02:13:57,319 --> 02:13:57,800
There it is.

2455
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:00,060
And I'm using it.

2456
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:03,500
Oh, oh, right.

2457
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:03,739
Okay.

2458
02:14:05,050 --> 02:14:05,289
Okay.

2459
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:07,609
So now very cool.

2460
02:14:07,609 --> 02:14:11,930
I am very happy about this time to destroy the rest of this game.

2461
02:14:13,930 --> 02:14:18,430
I had a plus 10 scale sword.

2462
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:20,510
Now we're going to see what happens when I get the real shit.

2463
02:14:21,149 --> 02:14:26,239
Ashes of war are applied to this item.

2464
02:14:26,239 --> 02:14:26,560
It's a lot.

2465
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,279
Wait, is this okay?

2466
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:29,479
Can you just give me my item back?

2467
02:14:30,699 --> 02:14:31,020
Prep.

2468
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:34,119
All right.

2469
02:14:34,119 --> 02:14:34,279
Okay.

2470
02:14:34,279 --> 02:14:38,119
So you're giving me your this is scary.

2471
02:14:38,119 --> 02:14:39,000
I kind of don't like this.

2472
02:14:41,689 --> 02:14:46,649
You're taking the only thing I have to make you just took the only thing I have.

2473
02:14:46,649 --> 02:14:47,130
That's true.

2474
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:48,090
Okay.

2475
02:14:48,090 --> 02:14:48,489
Here you go.

2476
02:14:49,050 --> 02:15:04,239
There's one and here's the other one.

2477
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:04,560
Cool.

2478
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:07,020
Okay.

2479
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:08,890
I banish you.

2480
02:15:13,869 --> 02:15:14,109
Okay.

2481
02:15:14,109 --> 02:15:23,279
Let's go to tried.

2482
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:25,500
Won't let me doing that thing again.

2483
02:15:37,529 --> 02:16:04,319
Try again, try again, try again.

2484
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:10,439
I cannot wait back alley deals for sword upgrades.

2485
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:27,369
You look like one of those street performers that paint themselves

2486
02:16:27,369 --> 02:16:30,350
silver and stand around all day.

2487
02:16:30,350 --> 02:16:31,949
Uh, do you have a smithing eight?

2488
02:16:33,389 --> 02:16:34,190
I'm going to need those.

2489
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:39,360
I don't.

2490
02:16:39,360 --> 02:16:41,280
I have smithing six is the highest I have.

2491
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:52,200
Oh, let me, let me complete that thought.

2492
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:56,440
Like, hold on.

2493
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:07,340
I got them to 16 and 18, but I am out of, um, smithing stone six.

2494
02:17:08,489 --> 02:17:09,209
Oh, I have those.

2495
02:17:09,850 --> 02:17:11,290
Just drop all the smithing stones.

2496
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:14,649
You have a past six.

2497
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:17,680
All of them or just singles.

2498
02:17:21,319 --> 02:17:26,379
I only have up to six that plus plus 18 plus that's fine.

2499
02:17:26,940 --> 02:17:29,079
Do you understand what we're doing and why I need them?

2500
02:17:29,079 --> 02:17:30,040
Just drop them.

2501
02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:32,120
I only have sixes though.

2502
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:35,479
Drop them then you told me you needed plus sevens.

2503
02:17:37,389 --> 02:17:40,030
I, you, I, I'm upgrading two weapons.

2504
02:17:40,030 --> 02:17:51,770
I needed a lot there.

2505
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,290
There's every smithing stone I own.

2506
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:56,620
I do feel like this is some kind of a scam.

2507
02:17:58,010 --> 02:17:59,290
Like you're going to be like, oh, thanks.

2508
02:17:59,930 --> 02:18:01,850
And you're going to pick those all up and disconnect.

2509
02:18:01,850 --> 02:18:03,209
And we're never going to talk ever again.

2510
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:08,440
Well, uh, I got them both to 19 and we need sevens.

2511
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:16,799
Just pick all those up because you probably need them eventually.

2512
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:18,319
For some reason.

2513
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:19,719
Yeah.

2514
02:18:19,719 --> 02:18:29,280
When you switch builds again, streamer beats Elden ring only using the kick.

2515
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,979
There they are.

2516
02:18:31,979 --> 02:18:32,700
There's your items.

2517
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:33,340
We got them.

2518
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:33,579
Get them.

2519
02:18:33,579 --> 02:18:34,139
Get them quick.

2520
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:34,780
You're about to cry.

2521
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,899
I know they do spawn.

2522
02:18:35,899 --> 02:18:36,459
Oh shit.

2523
02:18:36,459 --> 02:18:37,340
That actually could happen.

2524
02:18:42,430 --> 02:18:43,229
How am I?

2525
02:18:43,229 --> 02:18:46,510
268 plus 232 and it's a double.

2526
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:51,530
Do you have the claw talisman for jump attacks?

2527
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:54,409
I do, but I'm not going to use it.

2528
02:18:55,549 --> 02:18:57,149
Because you're scared.

2529
02:18:57,149 --> 02:18:59,549
No, because I want the extra ruins for now.

2530
02:18:59,549 --> 02:19:03,069
He's scared.

2531
02:19:04,110 --> 02:19:05,389
What a fucking baby.

2532
02:19:05,389 --> 02:19:05,790
Shut up.

2533
02:19:06,670 --> 02:19:09,719
I'm not scared of the jump attack.

2534
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:10,120
Shut up.

2535
02:19:10,680 --> 02:19:11,790
Shut up.

2536
02:19:11,790 --> 02:19:13,340
Eat it.

2537
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:14,059
You're it.

2538
02:19:14,059 --> 02:19:14,940
Shut up stupid.

2539
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:18,110
I'm not scared of your idiot.

2540
02:19:18,110 --> 02:19:22,360
All right, I'm ready to play the video game.

2541
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:26,040
That's fantastic news for people who like watching you play video games.

2542
02:19:26,040 --> 02:19:30,680
So let's go back to I'm imagining I'm going to follow you to put the artist shack

2543
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:32,680
and then we're going to go into the upside down world.

2544
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:33,879
Oh, no, I can.

2545
02:19:37,879 --> 02:19:42,139
I think you think you can accept the votes places you haven't been.

2546
02:19:42,139 --> 02:19:43,020
I cannot.

2547
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:47,049
I have to go to the artist shack.

2548
02:19:47,049 --> 02:19:48,569
Wasn't there a way we did this before?

2549
02:19:48,569 --> 02:19:50,809
You totally joined me in a place you hadn't been to before.

2550
02:19:50,809 --> 02:19:52,010
I think it's because I.

2551
02:19:52,010 --> 02:19:54,250
Oh, because we were disconnected and you never.

2552
02:19:54,649 --> 02:19:58,010
Oh, you were there and I just connected to you.

2553
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:05,399
Well, then you we have to go from the artist shack is right there.

2554
02:20:05,399 --> 02:20:07,079
Is that is it not right there?

2555
02:20:07,079 --> 02:20:08,280
No, you got to go down the hill.

2556
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:12,799
We got to go to Academy gate town and then go up the hill.

2557
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:15,879
Fight millennia, fight millennia.

2558
02:20:15,879 --> 02:20:16,520
Who?

2559
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:21,420
I'm not fighting millennia until these are both plus 20.

2560
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:34,700
I told her to lose my number and she cried.

2561
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:36,780
All right, let's go.

2562
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:40,860
I've got my final build.

2563
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:01,719
You look really cool.

2564
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:04,670
Where your cape is like fluttering.

2565
02:21:05,309 --> 02:21:09,200
You look pretty cool, too.

2566
02:21:12,379 --> 02:21:15,100
The way your smirk goes up on one side of your face

2567
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:18,639
to reveal your deep level of confidence that you have.

2568
02:21:21,979 --> 02:21:25,069
Let me I want this now.

2569
02:21:25,069 --> 02:21:31,950
So I want it now.

2570
02:21:32,909 --> 02:21:34,090
That's you.

2571
02:21:34,889 --> 02:21:43,520
That's you, man.

2572
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:45,159
All right, won't go.

2573
02:21:45,159 --> 02:21:46,120
How much for a golden goose?

2574
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:48,670
No, they're not for sale.

2575
02:21:49,629 --> 02:21:50,430
OK, but how much?

2576
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:01,520
All right.

2577
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:03,040
Here we are.

2578
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,440
Let's do the upside down level.

2579
02:22:13,209 --> 02:22:14,969
Having some trouble kind of.

2580
02:22:16,329 --> 02:22:17,610
My health bar is girthy.

2581
02:22:17,610 --> 02:22:20,809
Yeah, I actually like doubled my health from when we were fighting millennia.

2582
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:27,129
Did you or where are you?

2583
02:22:27,770 --> 02:22:28,329
All right.

2584
02:22:28,329 --> 02:22:30,489
You want to turn this upside down or you want to clear it first?

2585
02:22:32,639 --> 02:22:36,780
Do you there's not even a boss here.

2586
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:40,079
Is there a reason to I don't think so.

2587
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:53,739
There are items.

2588
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:57,020
Yeah, but they're like not good items.

2589
02:22:57,020 --> 02:23:01,770
Then we're like we're pretty like so huge that we don't even need them.

2590
02:23:03,370 --> 02:23:14,280
We are pretty beefy at this stage.

2591
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:19,899
I'm not going to find the axe of Godfrey and go and then restart my whole character.

2592
02:23:22,239 --> 02:23:23,280
Oh, hey, check it out, man.

2593
02:23:25,389 --> 02:23:26,510
But you wish you were this cool.

2594
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:31,739
Yeah, that's my great rune.

2595
02:23:40,729 --> 02:23:42,250
Yeah, I can do it, too.

2596
02:23:42,969 --> 02:23:43,530
You have one.

2597
02:23:47,629 --> 02:23:48,590
Kind of weird that you would lie.

2598
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:54,010
My power is your power.

2599
02:23:55,530 --> 02:23:57,129
I'm the one who passed it down to you.

2600
02:24:03,950 --> 02:24:05,790
This isn't upside down verse.

2601
02:24:05,870 --> 02:24:08,829
Do you need you need the elevator to go up to go on the upside down area?

2602
02:24:09,549 --> 02:24:10,110
It's fucking.

2603
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:13,360
This is the normal way.

2604
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:14,159
Why is this normal?

2605
02:24:14,719 --> 02:24:15,440
Come down.

2606
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:18,780
Come, come.

2607
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:19,899
Why is it right side up?

2608
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:24,959
Now you have to go.

2609
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,489
Wait, do we go through that window?

2610
02:24:29,209 --> 02:24:32,639
We go through that window.

2611
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:33,680
Yeah, something's wrong.

2612
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:34,559
You need the hourglass.

2613
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:35,360
We just put it on there.

2614
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:42,600
I think I took the hourglass off.

2615
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:43,799
You I think you took it off.

2616
02:24:43,799 --> 02:24:47,469
You I think you put it on and then I took it off.

2617
02:24:48,459 --> 02:24:50,299
Wait, why did you take it off?

2618
02:24:50,299 --> 02:24:52,879
I don't know.

2619
02:24:52,879 --> 02:24:53,440
Come down here.

2620
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:56,719
You walked up to the thing after I did that and you picked it up.

2621
02:24:57,790 --> 02:24:58,110
Yeah.

2622
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,790
Why did you do that?

2623
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:01,950
I didn't realize that you did it because I didn't think that you had it.

2624
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:09,690
It's going back upside down again.

2625
02:25:09,690 --> 02:25:10,969
OK, I put it back on.

2626
02:25:10,969 --> 02:25:12,170
OK, it's back up.

2627
02:25:12,170 --> 02:25:12,889
It's yeah.

2628
02:25:12,889 --> 02:25:13,370
All right.

2629
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:15,770
But then it flipped everyone.

2630
02:25:15,770 --> 02:25:16,489
They all died.

2631
02:25:17,389 --> 02:25:18,590
Yeah, it just killed everybody.

2632
02:25:28,360 --> 02:25:29,479
This guy's still here, though.

2633
02:25:34,700 --> 02:25:38,219
I loved I loved this area on my first playthrough.

2634
02:25:38,299 --> 02:25:40,299
When that guy's down, they're just casting.

2635
02:25:40,299 --> 02:25:41,420
Oh, that's right.

2636
02:25:41,420 --> 02:25:42,459
It's so awful.

2637
02:25:42,459 --> 02:26:00,079
I loved it.

2638
02:26:00,079 --> 02:26:00,559
Watch out.

2639
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:03,479
There's a giant gargle.

2640
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:04,360
I got to hit this.

2641
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,930
Watch out for the gargle.

2642
02:26:08,569 --> 02:26:14,350
All right, we should go around.

2643
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:18,219
I think the gargoyle is going to fall off.

2644
02:26:18,219 --> 02:26:21,020
I would say we should probably should bait the gargoyle to attack.

2645
02:26:21,020 --> 02:26:22,299
So it falls straight down.

2646
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:27,549
It's good to me.

2647
02:26:28,110 --> 02:26:30,940
OK, I'm just going to continue this way.

2648
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:33,020
And it can't even like fit over here.

2649
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:38,409
Um, it's like three, two, one.

2650
02:26:38,409 --> 02:26:38,969
You're going to die.

2651
02:26:39,770 --> 02:26:44,479
What are you doing?

2652
02:26:44,479 --> 02:26:47,850
I'm kind of in trouble.

2653
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,120
He's still alive down there.

2654
02:26:59,659 --> 02:27:01,100
How is he still alive?

2655
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:03,979
OK, well, there'll be a problem in about five minutes.

2656
02:27:13,719 --> 02:27:15,879
Holy shit, there's a thousand damage.

2657
02:27:15,879 --> 02:27:33,229
This is so overwhelming.

2658
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:37,879
How is this guy still alive?

2659
02:27:38,520 --> 02:27:40,040
He just stabbed himself in the chest.

2660
02:27:41,690 --> 02:27:42,649
Wow, I guess he wins.

2661
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:46,079
I got Erd Tree Heal.

2662
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:48,239
He just stabbed himself through the heart.

2663
02:27:50,649 --> 02:27:52,090
I got Erd Tree Heal if you want it.

2664
02:27:53,450 --> 02:27:54,809
I'd expect off the healing.

2665
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:59,120
That's a big drop.

2666
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:07,399
We're fine.

2667
02:28:09,770 --> 02:28:13,290
One problem, though, is we have an issue in a minute.

2668
02:28:13,850 --> 02:28:15,049
Once we get down a little further.

2669
02:28:27,479 --> 02:28:28,120
Items.

2670
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:32,280
You're blocking me.

2671
02:28:33,079 --> 02:28:34,040
You said, oh, items.

2672
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:35,239
I turned to look.

2673
02:28:37,979 --> 02:28:40,219
Oh, it's the people that fell when you turned it.

2674
02:28:50,110 --> 02:28:54,459
Dang.

2675
02:28:54,459 --> 02:28:55,100
Items up here?

2676
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:55,340
Yeah.

2677
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:55,579
Yeah.

2678
02:28:56,540 --> 02:28:59,819
Yeah, he landed in an unfortunate spot.

2679
02:28:59,819 --> 02:29:00,459
Yes, he did.

2680
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:02,750
I thought I was going to kill him.

2681
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:06,059
He's full health.

2682
02:29:06,059 --> 02:29:09,549
He's dumb.

2683
02:29:09,549 --> 02:29:09,870
In it.

2684
02:29:12,649 --> 02:29:13,690
Twilight shots.

2685
02:29:13,690 --> 02:29:19,500
I feel like he's just going to baseball swing one of us off this ledge.

2686
02:29:35,020 --> 02:29:36,219
I guess as ready as we're going to be.

2687
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:42,120
Who goes first?

2688
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:55,600
Oh, God, you got you guys.

2689
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:56,079
What?

2690
02:29:56,079 --> 02:29:57,040
Oh, we went down.

2691
02:29:57,600 --> 02:29:58,479
You touched the thing.

2692
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:00,000
Well, why do I spill?

2693
02:30:02,489 --> 02:30:03,450
He's going to be still.

2694
02:30:03,450 --> 02:30:04,329
Wait, can we crush him?

2695
02:30:05,129 --> 02:30:05,610
Wait, what?

2696
02:30:06,649 --> 02:30:07,290
Oh, fuck.

2697
02:30:07,930 --> 02:30:08,729
He's not coming down, right?

2698
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:13,639
He's dead.

2699
02:30:13,639 --> 02:30:15,690
Is he dead?

2700
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:23,020
How do I make this go back up?

2701
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:24,299
You can't step on him again?

2702
02:30:24,299 --> 02:30:24,459
No.

2703
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:28,670
Is there a lever?

2704
02:30:29,229 --> 02:30:30,110
Can you pull something?

2705
02:30:33,209 --> 02:30:33,530
Hold on.

2706
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:33,930
I don't think so.

2707
02:30:33,930 --> 02:30:34,329
Let me see.

2708
02:30:34,889 --> 02:30:39,479
Well, shit.

2709
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:48,409
Maybe.

2710
02:30:48,969 --> 02:30:50,399
Is there no lever up?

2711
02:30:50,399 --> 02:30:51,040
There's no lever.

2712
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:51,440
I don't think.

2713
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:53,120
There's a bonfire outside, though.

2714
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:59,079
Yeah, what happens if you reset the area and you touched it?

2715
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:00,120
Like if you die down there.

2716
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:01,500
Oh, no.

2717
02:31:02,059 --> 02:31:02,379
I'm sorry.

2718
02:31:02,379 --> 02:31:02,940
I just did.

2719
02:31:02,940 --> 02:31:04,299
I just there's a cut scene now.

2720
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:12,120
I forget what the heck is down here.

2721
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:18,520
This is how you go over to the other part of the tower.

2722
02:31:21,719 --> 02:31:22,680
The howling tree?

2723
02:31:23,899 --> 02:31:24,620
No, this is the thing.

2724
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:29,469
The one where you were talking about where you get invaded.

2725
02:31:29,469 --> 02:31:31,450
So what?

2726
02:31:31,450 --> 02:31:34,010
Yeah, if I step on this, I think the elevator might just be there for you.

2727
02:31:34,010 --> 02:31:34,729
Let's see.

2728
02:31:34,729 --> 02:31:35,770
Oh, I spawned here with you.

2729
02:31:36,329 --> 02:31:38,139
Oh, I see.

2730
02:31:38,139 --> 02:31:39,260
Cut scene teleport me.

2731
02:31:45,049 --> 02:31:45,770
Wow.

2732
02:31:45,770 --> 02:31:47,770
So am I just dumping strength?

2733
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:50,809
Dumping strength or jump into health?

2734
02:31:50,809 --> 02:31:53,159
Get health to like 50 first.

2735
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:54,280
Yeah.

2736
02:31:54,280 --> 02:31:55,319
Should I get strength to?

2737
02:31:55,959 --> 02:31:56,920
What's your health at?

2738
02:31:56,920 --> 02:31:57,959
What's the vigor?

2739
02:31:57,959 --> 02:31:58,600
Uh, 40.

2740
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:01,840
What's your strength at?

2741
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:02,239
50.

2742
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:05,159
Yeah, I'll get it.

2743
02:32:05,159 --> 02:32:06,840
I'll get this to 50 and then just dump everything.

2744
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,120
Growing boy.

2745
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:08,920
Look at how strong I am.

2746
02:32:09,559 --> 02:32:10,520
You're really.

2747
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:11,319
Oh, my God.

2748
02:32:13,950 --> 02:32:15,709
Yeah, I'm a I'm a Flintstone kid.

2749
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:21,440
Yeah, you can walk.

2750
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,079
You're gonna bug out the cut scene.

2751
02:32:25,719 --> 02:32:31,389
Watch out snail on the road.

2752
02:32:31,709 --> 02:32:38,860
Oh, my minus.

2753
02:32:38,860 --> 02:32:41,420
Oh, Gen Z doesn't get that one, dude.

2754
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:42,299
Oh, that's true.

2755
02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:54,319
Is this doesn't it happen here?

2756
02:32:56,170 --> 02:32:57,610
This is not where it happens.

2757
02:32:57,610 --> 02:32:58,569
I believe so.

2758
02:32:58,569 --> 02:32:59,530
On the other side of the door.

2759
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:07,159
And I hope it's some really weird enemies.

2760
02:33:07,799 --> 02:33:15,500
But if you crouch, they can't see you.

2761
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:17,420
It was the snail.

2762
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:18,940
You said crouching was useless.

2763
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:20,059
Wait, it was the snail.

2764
02:33:20,780 --> 02:33:22,159
Did we just run by that?

2765
02:33:22,159 --> 02:33:22,799
Stupid.

2766
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:24,000
The snail was the boss.

2767
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:29,549
It didn't go into the cut scene, though.

2768
02:33:32,159 --> 02:33:34,000
Do you have to kill the snail to activate it?

2769
02:33:40,090 --> 02:33:41,610
This elevator takes so long, though.

2770
02:34:00,569 --> 02:34:14,219
Oh, but oh, we're on great run.

2771
02:34:15,020 --> 02:34:15,899
You got another great run.

2772
02:34:16,459 --> 02:34:18,219
Yeah, I'm loaded.

2773
02:34:18,780 --> 02:34:24,170
OK, so we jump here.

2774
02:34:25,979 --> 02:34:27,180
Go back and we kill the snail.

2775
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:28,379
We go back and we kill the snail.

2776
02:34:30,110 --> 02:34:34,829
It's just I want to support to wait.

2777
02:34:34,829 --> 02:34:35,549
What do you think?

2778
02:34:35,549 --> 02:34:36,510
What's going through your head?

2779
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:37,469
We got to kill a snail.

2780
02:34:38,270 --> 02:34:40,649
It's bugged again.

2781
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:42,489
I tried.

2782
02:34:43,049 --> 02:34:45,149
No, he doesn't deserve it.

2783
02:34:45,149 --> 02:34:46,350
This is not the right tower.

2784
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:53,020
You're thinking of a different bridge.

2785
02:34:54,110 --> 02:34:55,870
Yeah, I think we just have this tower now.

2786
02:34:56,750 --> 02:35:00,649
OK, then where are we going next?

2787
02:35:00,649 --> 02:35:03,870
Well, we were going up this path.

2788
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:05,469
There's still an urn tree.

2789
02:35:05,469 --> 02:35:09,870
We could do the snow zone.

2790
02:35:09,870 --> 02:35:13,709
Use your medallion and get up there.

2791
02:35:13,709 --> 02:35:16,190
We could do some more.

2792
02:35:16,190 --> 02:35:16,829
Where do you do that?

2793
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,799
We have to go through the capital

2794
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:22,479
and go down that road.

2795
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:24,799
And we go up the lift and go to the snow zone.

2796
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:31,000
The snail is supposed to be a noble.

2797
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:31,799
Oh, that's right.

2798
02:35:31,799 --> 02:35:32,120
Yeah.

2799
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:33,559
No, that is where one of the nobles is.

2800
02:35:33,559 --> 02:35:34,120
Yeah.

2801
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:34,680
Go to the bridge.

2802
02:35:35,870 --> 02:35:39,370
The snail is going to have boss loot.

2803
02:35:39,370 --> 02:35:44,889
Oh, fucking.

2804
02:35:44,889 --> 02:35:50,200
Boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot, boss loot.

2805
02:35:50,200 --> 02:35:52,920
We can also apparently go to Radon's tower,

2806
02:35:52,920 --> 02:36:01,659
which I think we have a portal to.

2807
02:36:01,659 --> 02:36:04,700
What major thing have we not done besides the snow zone?

2808
02:36:05,979 --> 02:36:07,180
We're pretty we're close.

2809
02:36:08,319 --> 02:36:10,079
We're close to being able to beat the game.

2810
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:12,479
We never went down to Moog.

2811
02:36:12,479 --> 02:36:13,360
We didn't do Moog.

2812
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,639
But do we really want to do Moog?

2813
02:36:17,899 --> 02:36:18,940
I forget where you were.

2814
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:20,540
You even enter that area.

2815
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:22,940
The Caelid's tower is Radon.

2816
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:27,559
Oh, my God.

2817
02:36:27,559 --> 02:36:28,360
It really was.

2818
02:36:29,399 --> 02:36:29,639
What?

2819
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,100
OK.

2820
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:32,780
There's so many items.

2821
02:36:35,129 --> 02:36:35,450
Hold on.

2822
02:36:35,450 --> 02:36:35,930
I just got.

2823
02:36:35,930 --> 02:36:36,489
What was that?

2824
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:48,120
Man, that guy was loaded.

2825
02:36:48,120 --> 02:36:49,559
I got another piece of the Curseful Knight.

2826
02:36:50,680 --> 02:36:51,239
Holy shit.

2827
02:37:00,430 --> 02:37:01,389
Now I look pretty cool.

2828
02:37:07,159 --> 02:37:10,040
OK, so, yeah, we can either go up the lift.

2829
02:37:10,040 --> 02:37:10,520
We can do.

2830
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:17,479
Do we have any blue keys?

2831
02:37:17,479 --> 02:37:20,590
We could do one of the teleporters.

2832
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:23,799
What are those keys called?

2833
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:26,840
They're like a blue stone sword or something.

2834
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:28,120
They have a special name.

2835
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:29,159
I have one.

2836
02:37:29,159 --> 02:37:31,159
I have imbued sword key.

2837
02:37:31,159 --> 02:37:32,360
Which one of those is unsealed?

2838
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:34,200
Yeah, that is a unsealed sending gate.

2839
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:41,879
I know one of them takes you to the sewers, right?

2840
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:47,370
One goes to a random spot in Nocaran.

2841
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:51,659
One goes to Faramazula and one goes to.

2842
02:37:52,379 --> 02:37:53,690
Yeah, I don't know.

2843
02:37:53,690 --> 02:37:54,409
The last one goes.

2844
02:37:59,870 --> 02:38:00,989
It's far away in firm.

2845
02:38:00,989 --> 02:38:02,190
It's like in the distance, though.

2846
02:38:02,190 --> 02:38:03,069
It's not the actual zone.

2847
02:38:03,629 --> 02:38:04,829
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2848
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:07,559
Oh, it's that.

2849
02:38:07,559 --> 02:38:12,729
It's the tutorial zone where you go.

2850
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:17,209
We fight that sentry thing, the scion, whatever it is.

2851
02:38:17,209 --> 02:38:18,329
OK, let's just go there.

2852
02:38:18,329 --> 02:38:20,969
And we none of us remember which one goes where.

2853
02:38:20,969 --> 02:38:22,010
So let's just use one.

2854
02:38:22,010 --> 02:38:22,409
Cool.

2855
02:38:22,409 --> 02:38:24,440
I mean, I'm down for that.

2856
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:24,840
Whoops.

2857
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:26,200
I voted Ronnie's rise.

2858
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:28,280
That's not that's not correct.

2859
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:29,959
It's down here at the four Belfry.

2860
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:49,639
Vote rejected because I vote the wrong place.

2861
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:53,870
There we go.

2862
02:38:53,870 --> 02:39:00,809
I have the hiccups.

2863
02:39:00,809 --> 02:39:08,139
Do something, dude, for like a strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry.

2864
02:39:08,139 --> 02:39:11,389
Bet you don't have many more for like a month.

2865
02:39:11,389 --> 02:39:15,069
Every time I started my stream, I got hiccups.

2866
02:39:17,370 --> 02:39:18,329
It was uncanny.

2867
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:22,969
Like stream start hiccups weird.

2868
02:39:22,969 --> 02:39:24,540
All right.

2869
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:25,420
So which one do you want to do?

2870
02:39:27,309 --> 02:39:31,020
That's one on the left.

2871
02:39:31,020 --> 02:39:32,780
I don't remember which one this one is.

2872
02:39:32,780 --> 02:39:34,459
There's one that's awful.

2873
02:39:34,459 --> 02:39:37,579
And it literally is just a tiny little part of knock Ron.

2874
02:39:37,579 --> 02:39:39,340
That's one crystal night and it's awful.

2875
02:39:39,979 --> 02:39:42,620
Yeah, I think that's the one to our left right now

2876
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:45,239
because I remember fighting that guy a lot.

2877
02:39:45,239 --> 02:39:50,110
I think I had to go back through that portal every time.

2878
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:56,989
We didn't do the Lake of Rod.

2879
02:39:56,989 --> 02:39:58,750
No, that's another underground area we haven't been to.

2880
02:39:58,750 --> 02:40:02,600
Oh, it's the chapel.

2881
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:06,909
It's a chapel.

2882
02:40:09,579 --> 02:40:10,379
Oh, your host.

2883
02:40:10,379 --> 02:40:10,860
You can see it.

2884
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:13,260
You get to have the you get to see the movie before I do.

2885
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:15,340
Yeah, I'm in the movie theater already.

2886
02:40:16,479 --> 02:40:20,280
What was this in the very beginning?

2887
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:24,440
Um, I I was like a berserker.

2888
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:31,899
Ah, it was.

2889
02:40:50,719 --> 02:40:54,250
I'm just I'm just spamming L1.

2890
02:40:54,250 --> 02:40:54,889
Okay, we're good.

2891
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:56,760
It's a bunch of items.

2892
02:41:02,010 --> 02:41:02,409
Okay.

2893
02:41:03,370 --> 02:41:05,610
So I got I got Twiggy cracked here.

2894
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:08,329
That sounds like the name of some fucked up YouTube channel.

2895
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:16,000
Uh, we go back into the church, right?

2896
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,559
Isn't this a way to get up and walk around and look around, right?

2897
02:41:19,819 --> 02:41:21,659
And I don't think there's anything else here.

2898
02:41:21,659 --> 02:41:22,379
Oh, no, no, no, no.

2899
02:41:22,379 --> 02:41:23,020
Come over here.

2900
02:41:23,020 --> 02:41:23,899
I remember this up in here.

2901
02:41:26,510 --> 02:41:28,190
They say, um, there's a spot.

2902
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:28,590
Did you have you?

2903
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:29,389
Did you ever come back here?

2904
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:33,319
Yeah, there's a spot up here.

2905
02:41:33,879 --> 02:41:36,280
I think on the ledge where you have to jump from it.

2906
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:54,860
I think that kind of hurt my feelings.

2907
02:41:56,489 --> 02:41:58,489
I think we actually can get up in the church, though.

2908
02:41:59,549 --> 02:42:00,670
Yeah, but there's no reason to.

2909
02:42:02,430 --> 02:42:03,229
Who cares?

2910
02:42:03,229 --> 02:42:05,950
But there's items, this random stuff.

2911
02:42:05,950 --> 02:42:07,149
It could be a Lord's rune.

2912
02:42:07,149 --> 02:42:08,030
You don't know.

2913
02:42:08,030 --> 02:42:10,829
Oh, my God.

2914
02:42:10,829 --> 02:42:21,899
Who cares?

2915
02:42:21,899 --> 02:42:22,780
I do.

2916
02:42:22,780 --> 02:42:26,510
Now, how do you get to the road route from the Capitol?

2917
02:42:26,510 --> 02:42:35,180
Like you go, you just there's a what?

2918
02:42:35,180 --> 02:42:36,219
Wait, why is she?

2919
02:42:36,219 --> 02:42:37,100
Why is she alive?

2920
02:42:41,850 --> 02:42:45,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2921
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:46,079
Oh, yeah.

2922
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:55,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2923
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:57,680
There's an is let me just see if it's a legendary.

2924
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:58,639
Oh, is it?

2925
02:42:58,639 --> 02:42:59,120
I don't know.

2926
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:00,159
It's in a chest.

2927
02:43:00,159 --> 02:43:04,110
It could be a legendary.

2928
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:09,040
She's like the mushrooms growing out of her fucking head.

2929
02:43:17,129 --> 02:43:17,770
Yes, I know.

2930
02:43:17,770 --> 02:43:18,010
I know.

2931
02:43:18,010 --> 02:43:22,139
But look, letter from volcano manner.

2932
02:43:22,139 --> 02:43:23,819
That's why you come up here.

2933
02:43:23,819 --> 02:43:25,180
That's why you explore.

2934
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:26,379
Now we can do right card.

2935
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:29,879
I have that.

2936
02:43:29,879 --> 02:43:31,879
I mentioned it earlier and I said, I don't remember.

2937
02:43:31,879 --> 02:43:33,319
I got letter from volcano manner.

2938
02:43:33,319 --> 02:43:34,680
I don't know if we needed that or not.

2939
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:36,600
Oh, it was like an hour ago.

2940
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:43,479
Well, let's.

2941
02:43:43,479 --> 02:43:48,190
OK, you did write card.

2942
02:43:48,190 --> 02:43:49,770
That wasn't right card.

2943
02:43:49,770 --> 02:43:51,930
Now, that wasn't the real right card.

2944
02:43:51,930 --> 02:43:56,399
OK, so you want to write card, then we could give her letters and shit.

2945
02:43:56,399 --> 02:43:58,559
Yeah, let's see what's down there might as well.

2946
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:04,799
We're going to hit a point here very soon where we're going to unlock the giant area.

2947
02:44:04,799 --> 02:44:08,139
We're going to do the giant and then we can just end the game.

2948
02:44:08,139 --> 02:44:12,170
You need the thing to burn in the bowl.

2949
02:44:12,250 --> 02:44:15,840
I think you need like an ember or something.

2950
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:16,879
I think you just need.

2951
02:44:16,879 --> 02:44:20,620
I think you just need a certain millennia.

2952
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:22,600
I think you just need her up there.

2953
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:26,520
You sit at the bonfire up in the big crucible thing.

2954
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:33,979
I don't think you need an item.

2955
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:35,370
All right.

2956
02:44:35,370 --> 02:44:36,729
And then the letter over.

2957
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:43,000
Join.

2958
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:46,840
Thank you.

2959
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:53,209
OK, so now we have to go do an invasion, right?

2960
02:44:53,209 --> 02:45:00,879
Wait, we're going to get a different item every time we do this.

2961
02:45:00,879 --> 02:45:06,719
There may be some flaws to the plan.

2962
02:45:06,719 --> 02:45:07,600
I have two of them.

2963
02:45:07,600 --> 02:45:14,520
I have I have I lay the idol and I have great horn to drag off.

2964
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:16,120
I don't know the words you're saying.

2965
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:30,639
Go into your where the letter is because there's three letters.

2966
02:45:30,639 --> 02:45:31,360
Who are you?

2967
02:45:33,450 --> 02:45:34,909
What does your letter say?

2968
02:45:34,909 --> 02:45:41,450
The letter you have the assassination missions are optional for right card.

2969
02:45:41,450 --> 02:45:44,600
I can't find it.

2970
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:49,239
But so then how do we get down to right card if we have?

2971
02:45:49,239 --> 02:45:53,239
I thought you did those three and they're like, oh, yes, you can go talk to our lord.

2972
02:45:53,879 --> 02:45:55,559
I have the red letter.

2973
02:45:55,559 --> 02:46:02,780
I don't know how I it's past millennia.

2974
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:05,340
Juno Haslow, Knight of Blood.

2975
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:05,579
All right.

2976
02:46:05,579 --> 02:46:07,420
So wait, I have the other two.

2977
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:09,020
There's only three, right?

2978
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:13,209
Well, then also that enemy is going to be randomized.

2979
02:46:13,209 --> 02:46:18,360
Oh, yeah, that's true.

2980
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:24,170
Let's make our way up the road route.

2981
02:46:24,170 --> 02:46:24,809
Let's make our way.

2982
02:46:24,809 --> 02:46:25,049
All right.

2983
02:46:25,049 --> 02:46:29,049
East East Capitol Rampart or Capitol Rampart.

2984
02:46:29,049 --> 02:46:29,690
Which one of these?

2985
02:46:29,930 --> 02:46:33,850
I think you have to do the Avenue balcony and then run down the road.

2986
02:46:33,850 --> 02:46:34,649
I think you're right.

2987
02:46:34,649 --> 02:46:34,889
Yes.

2988
02:46:34,889 --> 02:46:35,290
No, you're right.

2989
02:46:35,290 --> 02:46:37,610
Because you open you open the door and you walk through.

2990
02:46:37,610 --> 02:46:48,969
Just kill millennia forehead.

2991
02:46:48,969 --> 02:46:51,850
Who?

2992
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:54,170
Check your your physique tears.

2993
02:46:54,170 --> 02:46:57,530
Feels OK, man.

2994
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:59,930
Chat just wants you guys to get mad at millennia.

2995
02:46:59,930 --> 02:47:00,430
Yeah.

2996
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:03,129
You guys want us to go there and get stuck for four hours.

2997
02:47:03,129 --> 02:47:05,770
And like us make a bunch of cartoon sound effects.

2998
02:47:06,489 --> 02:47:09,930
And me to bite my mic stand and like smash my face to my microphone.

2999
02:47:09,930 --> 02:47:13,530
Yeah. And don't like bite my lips so hard that my lip bleeds a little bit.

3000
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:17,360
That way.

3001
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:19,040
Do we have to like jump off the edge over here?

3002
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:26,479
Probably is a is a path that has it's the path that has the urge tree avatar on it.

3003
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:29,000
Yeah, this is it's coming.

3004
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,120
Are you sure it's not going to come with me?

3005
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:30,520
I'll come with me.

3006
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:30,920
No, come on.

3007
02:47:30,920 --> 02:47:31,479
No, come with me.

3008
02:47:31,479 --> 02:47:32,760
I think you can jump down.

3009
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:32,920
Yeah.

3010
02:47:32,920 --> 02:47:33,639
No, come with me.

3011
02:47:35,930 --> 02:47:38,969
Yeah, I guess I'm doing I'll look in a minute once you get to a better spot.

3012
02:47:38,969 --> 02:47:39,370
Other way.

3013
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:42,780
Well, what you make a decision here.

3014
02:47:42,780 --> 02:47:44,540
Oh, I didn't see you actually followed me.

3015
02:47:44,540 --> 02:47:47,659
Now you use your run speed ninjutsu.

3016
02:47:47,659 --> 02:47:49,579
We just have to go to the big door at the end, right?

3017
02:47:50,969 --> 02:48:05,399
Yes. So Andy, I like that was you need did you need somersmithing stone sevens?

3018
02:48:09,079 --> 02:48:10,040
I don't know what I need.

3019
02:48:11,319 --> 02:48:12,040
What is that?

3020
02:48:12,600 --> 02:48:16,299
What is this is the this is the wrong door.

3021
02:48:17,020 --> 02:48:18,139
Oh, it's another dragon.

3022
02:48:18,139 --> 02:48:20,219
This dragon so badly wants to get over.

3023
02:48:20,219 --> 02:48:25,850
No, no, it's this one because then we go up and wrap around.

3024
02:48:25,850 --> 02:48:26,489
This is like this.

3025
02:48:26,489 --> 02:48:27,049
Yeah, that's it.

3026
02:48:28,219 --> 02:48:31,370
I think now.

3027
02:48:31,370 --> 02:48:32,489
Yeah, this is definitely it.

3028
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:39,319
OK, smash, smash, watch out.

3029
02:48:42,459 --> 02:48:44,250
Watch out.

3030
02:48:44,250 --> 02:48:45,049
We got a bleeder.

3031
02:48:45,049 --> 02:48:48,090
You know what one of my favorite sound effects is in all video games?

3032
02:48:49,100 --> 02:48:49,500
I don't.

3033
02:48:50,430 --> 02:48:59,100
It was when ever you got a double dunk from that like it was like a crit sound.

3034
02:48:59,100 --> 02:49:02,219
It was like it was the best sound effect in gaming.

3035
02:49:02,940 --> 02:49:15,639
And if you got more than one, if you did twice in a row, you'd be like,

3036
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:22,760
something weird about seeing my wife type in all caps based,

3037
02:49:22,760 --> 02:49:25,000
like the streams have been having an effect on her

3038
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,760
because she wouldn't have said that like a week ago.

3039
02:49:33,530 --> 02:49:33,930
Based.

3040
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:42,000
What's wrong?

3041
02:49:42,729 --> 02:49:44,889
Now she just says, oh, with a crying face.

3042
02:49:44,889 --> 02:49:45,610
Now, I don't know.

3043
02:49:47,709 --> 02:49:48,510
She's in trouble.

3044
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:51,450
And then she says, make it rain.

3045
02:49:51,450 --> 02:49:52,889
I make it rain.

3046
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:55,610
It's just to get out of any conversation.

3047
02:49:55,610 --> 02:49:56,170
Make it rain.

3048
02:49:56,809 --> 02:49:57,370
Make it rain.

3049
02:50:01,659 --> 02:50:03,659
I thought you died your hair.

3050
02:50:03,659 --> 02:50:03,979
What?

3051
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:05,840
Don't kill him.

3052
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:06,719
He's a musician.

3053
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:08,159
All right.

3054
02:50:08,159 --> 02:50:08,559
All right.

3055
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:09,040
I won't.

3056
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:09,520
I bounced.

3057
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:11,920
Kill him.

3058
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:12,959
He's a musician.

3059
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,559
All right.

3060
02:50:16,559 --> 02:50:17,760
Play us a song then.

3061
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:19,420
Play us a song.

3062
02:50:20,059 --> 02:50:24,430
Play us a song.

3063
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:28,719
Oh, that's a hit.

3064
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:29,920
Help.

3065
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:30,559
Help.

3066
02:50:30,559 --> 02:50:30,879
What?

3067
02:50:33,559 --> 02:50:34,360
It's a magician.

3068
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:39,209
Hold on.

3069
02:50:39,209 --> 02:50:43,340
Let me get the double dunk.

3070
02:50:43,340 --> 02:50:53,819
Nope.

3071
02:50:53,819 --> 02:50:56,780
Hey, play us up.

3072
02:50:57,340 --> 02:50:57,899
Roxanne.

3073
02:50:58,799 --> 02:50:59,920
You know, Roxanne.

3074
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:00,639
Can you do that one?

3075
02:51:03,770 --> 02:51:05,690
Oh, that was pretty good.

3076
02:51:10,620 --> 02:51:11,260
No, please.

3077
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:27,260
What's the highest minus a chatter can give you?

3078
02:51:27,260 --> 02:51:29,579
Like if they do a plus two or minus two,

3079
02:51:29,579 --> 02:51:31,340
when have you done something so awful

3080
02:51:31,340 --> 02:51:33,420
that they're allowed to be like minus 10?

3081
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:34,059
It doesn't count.

3082
02:51:36,729 --> 02:51:39,530
It's it was it's either good or bad.

3083
02:51:39,530 --> 02:51:42,090
It's not like super good or super bad.

3084
02:51:42,090 --> 02:51:44,170
It's just it was that good or bad.

3085
02:51:45,129 --> 02:51:45,530
That's it.

3086
02:51:46,329 --> 02:51:49,799
Oh, mega dung beetle.

3087
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:54,750
I don't know.

3088
02:51:54,750 --> 02:51:55,469
I don't want to kill this.

3089
02:51:56,190 --> 02:51:57,549
Oh, but you'll kill the musician.

3090
02:51:58,270 --> 02:52:00,780
The guy's just out there playing for tips.

3091
02:52:11,950 --> 02:52:14,350
No, there's no plus one or minus one.

3092
02:52:15,370 --> 02:52:16,489
It's always two.

3093
02:52:16,489 --> 02:52:17,690
Why is it always two?

3094
02:52:17,690 --> 02:52:18,889
I don't know because it's supposed to be

3095
02:52:18,889 --> 02:52:20,889
the amount of minutes to add or subtract.

3096
02:52:20,889 --> 02:52:21,850
Do you even know the lore?

3097
02:52:22,649 --> 02:52:23,370
I don't.

3098
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:24,329
That's why I'm asking.

3099
02:52:24,889 --> 02:52:25,770
It's Alex and I.

3100
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:29,020
We played Kane and Lynch.

3101
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:30,219
This is the bridge, by the way.

3102
02:52:30,219 --> 02:52:30,860
Oh, let's do it.

3103
02:52:31,500 --> 02:52:34,299
I always honestly thought that plus two minus two.

3104
02:52:34,299 --> 02:52:35,819
Wait, where does this one this bridge?

3105
02:52:37,979 --> 02:52:41,340
I always thought plus two minus two was a Sims reference

3106
02:52:41,340 --> 02:52:43,739
because when you like your Sim has an interaction

3107
02:52:43,739 --> 02:52:45,020
that they do or don't like,

3108
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:46,540
but you can get like the minus two.

3109
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:48,379
Like, I don't I don't like what he's saying.

3110
02:52:48,379 --> 02:52:50,219
No, it was italics.

3111
02:52:50,219 --> 02:52:52,700
And I did a stream one time where we were like,

3112
02:52:52,700 --> 02:52:55,579
let's try to beat Kane and Lynch in one sitting.

3113
02:52:55,579 --> 02:52:57,610
The game is like three and a half hours

3114
02:52:57,610 --> 02:52:58,649
or four and a half hours long.

3115
02:52:58,649 --> 02:53:00,729
It's a very short game because it's the second one.

3116
02:53:02,190 --> 02:53:02,989
And we set up this thing.

3117
02:53:02,989 --> 02:53:03,469
Well, wait a minute.

3118
02:53:03,469 --> 02:53:06,700
What if we gave it a time limit for us

3119
02:53:06,700 --> 02:53:09,260
where we had to beat the game in two hours or something

3120
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:10,760
or three hours.

3121
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:13,290
But every time we made a good joke,

3122
02:53:13,290 --> 02:53:15,770
chat could add two minutes to the timer

3123
02:53:15,770 --> 02:53:18,649
or they could subtract two minutes from the timer.

3124
02:53:18,649 --> 02:53:20,059
Right. Okay.

3125
02:53:20,620 --> 02:53:22,620
So depending on how funny we were,

3126
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:24,219
we got to have more time to beat the game.

3127
02:53:24,219 --> 02:53:28,090
And it actually turned out to be we we ended up

3128
02:53:28,090 --> 02:53:29,690
at the last cut scene of the game,

3129
02:53:29,690 --> 02:53:34,030
I think with less than two or three minutes left.

3130
02:53:34,030 --> 02:53:37,209
That's a plus two.

3131
02:53:37,209 --> 02:53:41,120
I liked it better when I thought it was The Sims.

3132
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:46,969
I'm just sorry pretending as that.

3133
02:53:46,969 --> 02:53:48,090
Yeah. And we eventually,

3134
02:53:48,090 --> 02:53:49,610
once we had less than 20 minutes left,

3135
02:53:49,610 --> 02:53:50,969
we started getting kind of desperate

3136
02:53:50,969 --> 02:53:52,780
and the jokes were awful.

3137
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:54,219
And we were losing time.

3138
02:53:54,219 --> 02:53:57,469
Is it a hidden room here?

3139
02:53:57,469 --> 02:53:58,270
Yeah, there is.

3140
02:53:58,270 --> 02:53:59,389
I did see it.

3141
02:53:59,389 --> 02:54:00,889
It was down at the bottom.

3142
02:54:00,889 --> 02:54:04,250
I don't think I've ever been in that hidden room.

3143
02:54:04,250 --> 02:54:06,010
I'd like to make it a point that when we come back,

3144
02:54:06,010 --> 02:54:07,129
we go to that hidden room.

3145
02:54:07,129 --> 02:54:13,040
This might break both of our games.

3146
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:15,629
I don't think so.

3147
02:54:15,629 --> 02:54:19,659
It's just the Four Lords fight from Dark Souls 1.

3148
02:54:19,659 --> 02:54:23,319
Is it a dog?

3149
02:54:23,319 --> 02:54:24,360
Is it a single dog?

3150
02:54:25,719 --> 02:54:27,319
It's a dead guy.

3151
02:54:27,399 --> 02:54:28,200
It's a dead guy?

3152
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:30,399
Why was it?

3153
02:54:30,399 --> 02:54:30,959
I don't know.

3154
02:54:30,959 --> 02:54:33,500
I've just been waiting for someone to fight me so long.

3155
02:54:33,500 --> 02:54:34,059
I died.

3156
02:54:34,059 --> 02:54:36,139
El Misbegotten Crusader.

3157
02:54:36,139 --> 02:54:38,379
And I got Hora Lou's Earth Shatter.

3158
02:54:38,379 --> 02:54:40,319
Earth Shaker.

3159
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:41,319
Man.

3160
02:54:41,319 --> 02:54:43,000
What weapon is he holding?

3161
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:46,440
Oh, they're usually two?

3162
02:54:46,440 --> 02:54:47,079
Yeah.

3163
02:54:47,079 --> 02:54:48,200
There's the dead guy in this guy.

3164
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:50,600
That weapon is so cool looking.

3165
02:54:50,600 --> 02:54:51,719
That weapon is...

3166
02:54:51,719 --> 02:54:53,079
What weapon is that thing?

3167
02:54:53,079 --> 02:54:55,159
That's like the Elden Beast Remembrance.

3168
02:54:55,159 --> 02:54:55,639
Holy shit.

3169
02:54:55,639 --> 02:54:57,719
That thing is so fucking cool.

3170
02:54:57,719 --> 02:54:59,239
That's the coolest weapon in the game.

3171
02:54:59,239 --> 02:55:00,440
I've never seen that.

3172
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:03,159
Isn't that the one that shoots like a gigantic super...

3173
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:06,959
What the fuck?

3174
02:55:06,959 --> 02:55:08,239
I want this.

3175
02:55:08,239 --> 02:55:09,790
Hope he drops it.

3176
02:55:09,790 --> 02:55:18,540
It's the Golden Order Greatsword.

3177
02:55:19,100 --> 02:55:20,520
That thing is so cool.

3178
02:55:21,239 --> 02:55:30,170
Oh, time for Terma to change builds.

3179
02:55:32,159 --> 02:55:32,399
No.

3180
02:55:34,299 --> 02:55:35,579
That thing is awesome.

3181
02:55:35,579 --> 02:55:38,700
Scales great with Faith.

3182
02:55:38,700 --> 02:55:47,450
You have it in your inventory, bro.

3183
02:55:47,450 --> 02:55:48,409
I don't have it.

3184
02:55:48,409 --> 02:55:49,850
No, I don't.

3185
02:55:49,850 --> 02:55:50,729
You have to look now.

3186
02:55:51,739 --> 02:55:53,979
I don't.

3187
02:55:53,979 --> 02:55:56,540
I'm telling you, that sword is very distinct looking.

3188
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:57,979
I do not have it in my inventory.

3189
02:55:59,979 --> 02:56:01,340
I have the Glintstone Chris.

3190
02:56:02,059 --> 02:56:04,510
Oh, you got Chris?

3191
02:56:05,659 --> 02:56:07,180
No, I don't have this weapon.

3192
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:08,299
You guys are full of shit.

3193
02:56:11,959 --> 02:56:12,520
No.

3194
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:25,069
I'm going to level up.

3195
02:56:25,069 --> 02:56:27,790
It's the Faith version of the Moonlit Greatsword.

3196
02:56:27,790 --> 02:56:29,229
So I'll give you a cool build.

3197
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:32,200
Moonlit Greatsword one hand.

3198
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:33,719
Golden Order Greatsword on the other hand.

3199
02:56:35,850 --> 02:56:36,170
Sun.

3200
02:56:37,049 --> 02:56:37,370
Moon.

3201
02:56:38,010 --> 02:56:40,170
Oh, that's pretty cool.

3202
02:56:40,729 --> 02:56:42,250
The sun and moon conjoined.

3203
02:56:42,969 --> 02:56:44,889
Bat Chest me all you want.

3204
02:56:44,889 --> 02:56:46,329
That's what I'm doing on my next playthrough.

3205
02:56:46,889 --> 02:57:01,659
The Eclipse build.

3206
02:57:03,930 --> 02:57:06,170
Yeah, and I would wear really dark armor.

3207
02:57:06,889 --> 02:57:09,500
So it's like the sun and the moon eclipsing into each other.

3208
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:09,979
Come on.

3209
02:57:16,040 --> 02:57:30,270
Do you identify as the darkness or the light?

3210
02:57:30,270 --> 02:57:33,549
Bro, you would need to be level 200 to even attempt that.

3211
02:57:33,549 --> 02:57:34,190
That's all right.

3212
02:57:43,399 --> 02:57:44,520
Mog's Greatrun.

3213
02:57:46,879 --> 02:57:48,479
I also got Mog's Greatrun.

3214
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:51,879
Weird.

3215
02:57:51,879 --> 02:57:54,190
I think they're just here.

3216
02:57:54,190 --> 02:57:55,790
Oh, wait a minute.

3217
02:57:55,790 --> 02:57:59,100
Because you also had the thing?

3218
02:57:59,100 --> 02:57:59,739
No, I didn't.

3219
02:58:00,299 --> 02:58:02,379
Dude, I think they're just up here.

3220
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:03,340
You can just pick them up.

3221
02:58:04,799 --> 02:58:08,879
Wasn't that the great rune that you heal when you hit things?

3222
02:58:08,879 --> 02:58:12,000
Yeah, but are you understanding that I think we could have just

3223
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,159
come to two of these towers and gotten these?

3224
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:16,879
I think you can just pick them up off the ground.

3225
02:58:16,879 --> 02:58:22,590
I think the randomizer just puts them here because I didn't have that.

3226
02:58:22,590 --> 02:58:24,110
I had the unborn one.

3227
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:27,069
Well, yeah, that's millennials.

3228
02:58:27,069 --> 02:58:28,110
What does Mog's do?

3229
02:58:28,110 --> 02:58:30,110
Something about blood.

3230
02:58:30,750 --> 02:58:31,549
Blessing of blood.

3231
02:58:31,549 --> 02:58:32,799
Yeah, I don't know.

3232
02:58:32,799 --> 02:58:33,600
All right.

3233
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:35,520
Are you ready to go to the Forbidden Lands?

3234
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:39,799
No, I want it to go down that elevator.

3235
02:58:39,799 --> 02:58:42,559
So yeah, Forbidden Lands.

3236
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:45,200
And then I want to go in the elevator and do the secret room.

3237
02:58:53,180 --> 02:58:54,860
Yeah, I'll do the blast in a second.

3238
02:58:54,860 --> 02:59:14,829
I'm going to mark these because I know we'll forget.

3239
02:59:25,260 --> 02:59:25,819
Okay.

3240
02:59:25,819 --> 02:59:31,870
You're gonna tell a joke?

3241
02:59:49,819 --> 02:59:52,379
I think I saw it on the right when we were going up.

3242
02:59:52,379 --> 02:59:54,520
I think because we missed.

3243
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:55,479
Oh, it's right there.

3244
02:59:55,479 --> 02:59:56,200
They're right in front of us.

3245
02:59:56,200 --> 02:59:56,920
Straight forward.

3246
02:59:56,920 --> 02:59:57,399
You see it?

3247
02:59:57,399 --> 02:59:59,340
You look up.

3248
02:59:59,340 --> 02:59:59,899
Yeah.

3249
02:59:59,899 --> 03:00:00,590
Okay.

3250
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:01,309
We're going in there.

3251
03:00:12,940 --> 03:00:14,510
I forget what's in here.

3252
03:00:15,309 --> 03:00:16,809
I've never been in here.

3253
03:00:16,809 --> 03:00:18,170
Five dragon hearts?

3254
03:00:18,569 --> 03:00:19,690
How many of these do I have?

3255
03:00:21,629 --> 03:00:22,510
Yo, bruh.

3256
03:00:22,510 --> 03:00:27,739
Yo, I have 11 dragon hearts.

3257
03:00:27,739 --> 03:00:29,659
I could probably just go buy up the whole store.

3258
03:00:33,260 --> 03:00:37,819
Let's go to, you know, there's the dragon heart place on the first island.

3259
03:00:37,819 --> 03:00:39,420
And that like near the starter area.

3260
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:39,659
Yeah.

3261
03:00:40,299 --> 03:00:41,340
Let's go there.

3262
03:00:41,340 --> 03:00:41,659
Okay.

3263
03:00:43,870 --> 03:00:46,829
We need to it's right over here.

3264
03:00:47,469 --> 03:00:48,809
It's like down on the beach.

3265
03:00:49,690 --> 03:00:50,489
The entrance.

3266
03:00:50,489 --> 03:00:52,409
I think we just go to the first step, right?

3267
03:00:52,409 --> 03:00:55,479
Because it's right here.

3268
03:01:00,059 --> 03:01:00,540
Yeah.

3269
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:06,799
Do the one in Caleb.

3270
03:01:06,799 --> 03:01:07,920
The bigger one is in Caleb.

3271
03:01:08,559 --> 03:01:09,360
We've been there.

3272
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:10,159
Yeah, we've already been there.

3273
03:01:10,159 --> 03:01:11,680
And it sold a lot of good things.

3274
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:13,840
So I'm assuming this one will also sell good things.

3275
03:01:14,399 --> 03:01:16,239
This one will be different too, right?

3276
03:01:16,239 --> 03:01:16,799
Yeah.

3277
03:01:16,799 --> 03:01:21,930
It's doing that thing.

3278
03:01:21,930 --> 03:01:23,290
Really is doing that thing.

3279
03:01:23,290 --> 03:01:26,329
We haven't had like crashes today or a lot of disconnecting.

3280
03:01:26,329 --> 03:01:26,969
It's been better.

3281
03:01:26,969 --> 03:01:28,569
Just the voting to warp sometimes.

3282
03:01:29,950 --> 03:01:31,229
This is the best mod.

3283
03:01:31,229 --> 03:01:31,870
This really is.

3284
03:01:31,870 --> 03:01:32,989
It's just so good.

3285
03:01:32,989 --> 03:01:35,840
I just can't.

3286
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:36,799
I can't believe.

3287
03:01:36,799 --> 03:01:40,510
I can't believe it's just, you know what I mean?

3288
03:01:40,510 --> 03:01:43,049
I can't believe I know what you mean.

3289
03:01:43,049 --> 03:01:44,170
Are you drinking pickle juice?

3290
03:01:44,170 --> 03:01:46,829
No.

3291
03:01:47,069 --> 03:01:48,829
We never killed this slob right in the beginning.

3292
03:01:48,829 --> 03:01:51,979
When are you going to do a face reveal?

3293
03:01:51,979 --> 03:01:56,030
What if I just went like there's a clay coming off

3294
03:01:56,030 --> 03:01:57,790
and like I pulled my nose down.

3295
03:01:57,790 --> 03:01:59,159
Clay, clay.

3296
03:01:59,799 --> 03:02:03,629
And it was I was a different face under here.

3297
03:02:03,629 --> 03:02:04,590
It's the same face.

3298
03:02:05,770 --> 03:02:07,610
Just kind of very slightly different.

3299
03:02:17,770 --> 03:02:26,350
Oh, this is the rock one.

3300
03:02:26,350 --> 03:02:27,469
I can't lock on again.

3301
03:02:28,270 --> 03:02:45,930
All right.

3302
03:02:45,930 --> 03:02:50,430
Would you laugh if one of the best items in the whole game dropped right here?

3303
03:02:50,430 --> 03:02:52,350
And you could have had it at the very beginning.

3304
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:53,069
I would laugh.

3305
03:02:53,069 --> 03:02:53,629
I would laugh.

3306
03:02:54,270 --> 03:02:55,629
A crystal tear.

3307
03:02:55,629 --> 03:02:57,719
I don't even.

3308
03:02:57,719 --> 03:02:59,079
Strength, not crystal tear.

3309
03:02:59,639 --> 03:03:04,889
What are my opinions on Pilk?

3310
03:03:06,969 --> 03:03:07,450
Jesus.

3311
03:03:08,010 --> 03:03:08,969
I read that too fast.

3312
03:03:11,180 --> 03:03:11,659
Other way.

3313
03:03:12,459 --> 03:03:12,860
Friend.

3314
03:03:12,860 --> 03:03:13,500
Other way, friend.

3315
03:03:16,379 --> 03:03:17,340
Traveling to the beach.

3316
03:03:17,340 --> 03:03:18,540
This is our beach episode.

3317
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:36,889
The beach episode.

3318
03:03:42,879 --> 03:03:45,920
Oh, there's one of the invisible squigglies.

3319
03:03:47,399 --> 03:03:49,319
Can you still do your magma jump?

3320
03:03:49,319 --> 03:03:51,000
I cannot, but sorry.

3321
03:03:51,719 --> 03:03:54,409
I mean, you should still have that in your inventory.

3322
03:03:55,049 --> 03:03:57,399
I don't think I don't have any faith to use it though.

3323
03:03:58,620 --> 03:04:00,139
Most of these are very simple.

3324
03:04:00,139 --> 03:04:01,500
Just some of them are just annoying.

3325
03:04:01,500 --> 03:04:04,329
I'll get it right here.

3326
03:04:04,329 --> 03:04:07,129
That was so close.

3327
03:04:07,129 --> 03:04:08,489
Like that was literally a frame.

3328
03:04:08,489 --> 03:04:09,129
Yeah, there we go.

3329
03:04:12,879 --> 03:04:13,200
All right.

3330
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:14,079
Crash.

3331
03:04:14,079 --> 03:04:15,600
So how do we get over there?

3332
03:04:16,239 --> 03:04:19,420
We need to go this way.

3333
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:21,739
It's like a weird teleporter or something, isn't it?

3334
03:04:22,829 --> 03:04:23,309
No.

3335
03:04:23,309 --> 03:04:24,270
Oh, you know, you can just walk.

3336
03:04:24,270 --> 03:04:25,069
You can just walk.

3337
03:04:25,069 --> 03:04:26,510
There's a cave that goes under.

3338
03:04:27,389 --> 03:04:33,559
You got to go in the cave and battle the dwellers of the deep.

3339
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:37,069
Oh, the buck cave.

3340
03:04:37,069 --> 03:04:38,030
Yeah, that's true.

3341
03:04:39,549 --> 03:04:39,790
Yeah.

3342
03:04:39,790 --> 03:04:41,309
Amadeus is in there.

3343
03:04:41,309 --> 03:04:42,510
Big hand boss.

3344
03:04:42,510 --> 03:04:43,469
Just hanging out over here.

3345
03:04:48,200 --> 03:04:49,479
There's a merchant up here.

3346
03:04:49,479 --> 03:04:51,479
I'm going to go see if he's got any cool items.

3347
03:04:51,479 --> 03:04:55,079
I would, you know, it'd be more disappointing to see if this guy actually was selling like

3348
03:04:57,129 --> 03:04:58,250
something ridiculous.

3349
03:04:58,250 --> 03:04:58,489
Yeah.

3350
03:05:04,030 --> 03:05:07,309
I mean, he does sell smithing stone 456 for me.

3351
03:05:13,739 --> 03:05:15,579
I think I was going to buy like a million of these.

3352
03:05:22,430 --> 03:05:23,549
Rose and needle.

3353
03:05:23,549 --> 03:05:24,430
What is this thing?

3354
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:28,200
That's a fun weapon.

3355
03:05:28,200 --> 03:05:32,840
I think it's a rapier that like shoots a ice projectile.

3356
03:05:33,559 --> 03:05:43,879
I'm going to buy it and I'm going to buy a hundred and four of these.

3357
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:47,229
Of what?

3358
03:05:48,190 --> 03:05:49,790
I have like little poison things now.

3359
03:05:50,510 --> 03:05:52,059
Hold on.

3360
03:05:52,059 --> 03:05:55,309
Okay, that sounds really cool.

3361
03:05:56,729 --> 03:05:57,850
That sounds incredible.

3362
03:05:58,489 --> 03:05:59,950
They scale with strength.

3363
03:06:02,989 --> 03:06:04,430
I'm going to kill him while you're talking.

3364
03:06:04,430 --> 03:06:04,829
Don't.

3365
03:06:04,829 --> 03:06:06,190
This guy has awesome shit for me.

3366
03:06:06,190 --> 03:06:06,590
Don't do it.

3367
03:06:10,040 --> 03:06:10,360
Why?

3368
03:06:10,360 --> 03:06:12,520
Oh, yeah, I can take the better the bell bearing.

3369
03:06:13,239 --> 03:06:17,479
Why do you want to?

3370
03:06:17,479 --> 03:06:19,239
Why do you want to kill these guys?

3371
03:06:21,049 --> 03:06:22,409
What's wrong with you?

3372
03:06:22,409 --> 03:06:22,809
I don't.

3373
03:06:22,809 --> 03:06:23,690
I just want to go in the cave.

3374
03:06:25,370 --> 03:06:26,489
It's holding you up.

3375
03:06:26,489 --> 03:06:28,969
I know, but I need to put this on my bar because now I have

3376
03:06:28,969 --> 03:06:31,930
I have like 200 fucking poison like darts.

3377
03:06:33,739 --> 03:06:35,819
I got 200 poison snowballs.

3378
03:06:35,819 --> 03:06:42,399
Oh, watch out.

3379
03:06:42,399 --> 03:06:43,280
It's pretty dark down here.

3380
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:53,120
Now all merchants are hostile.

3381
03:06:55,719 --> 03:06:56,440
Okay.

3382
03:06:56,440 --> 03:06:58,540
That's like that's cute.

3383
03:06:58,540 --> 03:07:00,299
They think they think they can take us.

3384
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:05,159
All right.

3385
03:07:05,159 --> 03:07:09,870
What do I got here?

3386
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:16,590
Boys charged attacks.

3387
03:07:22,489 --> 03:07:23,049
What?

3388
03:07:23,049 --> 03:07:26,250
This guy's on the ground dying and he's like, oh, they're going to kill me.

3389
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:28,250
I'm like, here have a golden sewing needle.

3390
03:07:29,129 --> 03:07:31,610
Does that make this better?

3391
03:07:35,799 --> 03:07:37,479
I kind of don't want to take anything off.

3392
03:07:39,770 --> 03:07:39,930
Good.

3393
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:41,450
Now you stop complaining.

3394
03:07:42,250 --> 03:07:44,350
I think I'm all right now.

3395
03:07:44,909 --> 03:07:52,280
Don't I have the needle?

3396
03:07:53,079 --> 03:07:54,040
I gave it to him.

3397
03:07:54,040 --> 03:07:54,440
Oh, okay.

3398
03:07:57,479 --> 03:07:58,200
Okay.

3399
03:07:58,200 --> 03:08:04,620
I mean, it's kind of embarrassing.

3400
03:08:04,620 --> 03:08:07,180
There's like a really low level zone for him to be dying in.

3401
03:08:08,139 --> 03:08:08,940
All right.

3402
03:08:08,940 --> 03:08:11,979
Test these to see if this is worth be spending like 20,000 souls.

3403
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:14,059
Don't kill the guy over there.

3404
03:08:16,920 --> 03:08:17,559
What the hell?

3405
03:08:18,120 --> 03:08:24,889
This is like a fucking mess.

3406
03:08:25,530 --> 03:08:30,159
I don't know what just happened.

3407
03:08:33,790 --> 03:08:35,389
A swift glint stone shard.

3408
03:08:35,389 --> 03:08:37,790
I know I don't do magic, but that's pretty good one.

3409
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:39,979
What the fuck?

3410
03:08:39,979 --> 03:08:43,840
Where are they?

3411
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:47,319
Oh, shit trio.

3412
03:08:47,319 --> 03:08:50,120
That's kind of funny because there's normally like a bunch of guys here.

3413
03:09:04,569 --> 03:09:06,329
These guys are so parryable by the way.

3414
03:09:06,969 --> 03:09:07,690
Mr. Perry.

3415
03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:09,360
Yeah.

3416
03:09:10,559 --> 03:09:12,719
I don't have like my weapon doesn't really hurt them.

3417
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:17,260
Oh, I don't I don't have a parry shield.

3418
03:09:21,450 --> 03:09:24,170
The other one's just like spinning in the corner.

3419
03:09:25,290 --> 03:09:29,149
She gave me scarlet rot.

3420
03:09:30,040 --> 03:09:30,360
Yep.

3421
03:09:35,239 --> 03:09:35,799
Please hold.

3422
03:09:49,629 --> 03:09:50,510
Break.

3423
03:09:50,510 --> 03:09:52,030
Do the noise.

3424
03:09:52,909 --> 03:09:53,549
Oh, you mean that?

3425
03:09:58,569 --> 03:10:01,049
Yeah, I don't know how I hurt them.

3426
03:10:02,569 --> 03:10:04,729
It's pretty much you have to parry them or use one.

3427
03:10:05,690 --> 03:10:10,670
That's what I mean.

3428
03:10:10,670 --> 03:10:14,510
I don't put on a parry shield, but now this one is unparryable.

3429
03:10:15,309 --> 03:10:18,750
It's kind of like a you like this is like where your character art starts to shine.

3430
03:10:19,389 --> 03:10:20,909
I'm doing pretty well.

3431
03:10:26,120 --> 03:10:28,520
I think you can hurt them now.

3432
03:10:29,399 --> 03:10:33,680
I think once like they get like broken up or something.

3433
03:10:33,680 --> 03:10:33,920
Yeah.

3434
03:10:40,379 --> 03:10:42,059
Oh, commoners headband.

3435
03:10:42,860 --> 03:10:44,860
Sombra ancient dragon smithing stone.

3436
03:10:44,860 --> 03:10:46,780
Oh, I got an ant skull shield.

3437
03:10:49,079 --> 03:10:49,959
That's kind of weird.

3438
03:10:53,760 --> 03:10:54,959
Ant skull plate.

3439
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:59,100
Look at this thing.

3440
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:03,709
No, look at this thing.

3441
03:11:03,709 --> 03:11:04,430
Look at where this is.

3442
03:11:04,430 --> 03:11:05,549
No, no.

3443
03:11:06,430 --> 03:11:07,469
Look at where this is.

3444
03:11:07,469 --> 03:11:11,950
Come here where I'm trying to go to the dragon temple.

3445
03:11:17,639 --> 03:11:19,000
I won't look at it.

3446
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:19,559
I won't look.

3447
03:11:24,090 --> 03:11:24,649
Don't exit.

3448
03:11:24,649 --> 03:11:25,290
Don't exit.

3449
03:11:25,290 --> 03:11:25,770
Don't exit.

3450
03:11:25,770 --> 03:11:26,170
Don't exit.

3451
03:11:26,170 --> 03:11:26,649
Don't exit.

3452
03:11:28,299 --> 03:11:33,819
They put that there to trick you like having blinked in a while.

3453
03:11:38,250 --> 03:11:38,809
Give it a try.

3454
03:11:39,370 --> 03:11:43,469
Okay.

3455
03:11:43,469 --> 03:11:44,670
Great stars.

3456
03:11:44,670 --> 03:11:55,420
Ooh, don't kill it.

3457
03:11:55,420 --> 03:11:56,139
Dude, come on.

3458
03:11:56,139 --> 03:11:59,559
I don't think we could have walked by.

3459
03:12:00,200 --> 03:12:01,639
He could jump over his legs.

3460
03:12:02,200 --> 03:12:19,340
Isn't there an invasion here too?

3461
03:12:20,489 --> 03:12:21,049
Yeah, maybe.

3462
03:12:28,569 --> 03:12:28,969
I didn't.

3463
03:12:29,530 --> 03:12:30,329
Oh, no.

3464
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:34,079
All right.

3465
03:12:34,079 --> 03:12:36,000
Hey guys, mind if I invade you?

3466
03:12:36,639 --> 03:12:39,659
That's like my favorite animal in Elden Ring.

3467
03:12:40,379 --> 03:12:41,180
Why did I do that?

3468
03:12:43,610 --> 03:12:44,489
Yeah, it's kind of suck.

3469
03:12:48,959 --> 03:12:50,000
Elden stars.

3470
03:12:51,790 --> 03:12:52,350
Great heal.

3471
03:12:53,069 --> 03:12:55,309
I mean, I feel like I should just get it.

3472
03:12:55,950 --> 03:12:58,430
I don't buy like 11 of these.

3473
03:12:59,069 --> 03:12:59,629
Buy everything.

3474
03:13:02,250 --> 03:13:04,090
You can sell Jerma anything.

3475
03:13:04,090 --> 03:13:05,530
Just put it in front of him.

3476
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:10,459
I mean, this is the only place you can spend this currency.

3477
03:13:10,459 --> 03:13:13,979
I have 11 of them and I can't spend it anywhere else.

3478
03:13:13,979 --> 03:13:14,940
So might as well get it.

3479
03:13:17,370 --> 03:13:18,250
You make a good point.

3480
03:13:18,809 --> 03:13:22,219
I forgot that they're like selling these based on like made up currency.

3481
03:13:22,219 --> 03:13:23,899
It is just a made up currency.

3482
03:13:23,899 --> 03:13:24,780
It's not runes.

3483
03:13:24,780 --> 03:13:26,860
It's just dragon hearts, which I have a ton of.

3484
03:13:27,579 --> 03:13:29,340
And there's only six items in the game.

3485
03:13:29,340 --> 03:13:30,459
I have 11 hearts.

3486
03:13:31,500 --> 03:13:36,520
I have a four or at least four or five surplus of hearts.

3487
03:13:36,520 --> 03:13:37,159
I have one.

3488
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:45,229
OK, so we're going to the we're going to the.

3489
03:14:10,139 --> 03:14:11,420
This area is too blue.

3490
03:14:13,549 --> 03:14:14,670
I wish they would redo it.

3491
03:14:15,879 --> 03:14:17,639
Hey, how do you go down to?

3492
03:14:18,760 --> 03:14:21,239
You know, we're all like the scarlet rot swamp is.

3493
03:14:22,040 --> 03:14:22,280
Yes.

3494
03:14:23,159 --> 03:14:24,600
Where is that entrance?

3495
03:14:24,600 --> 03:14:25,879
It's underground.

3496
03:14:25,879 --> 03:14:28,120
It's part of the quest line for Ronnie.

3497
03:14:29,389 --> 03:14:35,229
And from my understanding, you need to go there from not wrong.

3498
03:14:39,069 --> 03:14:45,739
Almost just walked off the edge looking at chat in my fault.

3499
03:14:46,680 --> 03:14:48,040
I don't know why I'm following you.

3500
03:14:48,840 --> 03:14:49,719
I know where I'm going.

3501
03:14:55,879 --> 03:14:56,840
Where are you going?

3502
03:14:57,850 --> 03:14:59,129
I know where I'm going.

3503
03:14:59,129 --> 03:14:59,920
We should get that.

3504
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:00,639
We got to get the map.

3505
03:15:07,840 --> 03:15:08,639
I know where I'm going.

3506
03:15:13,399 --> 03:15:14,680
That old man had it coming.

3507
03:15:21,389 --> 03:15:25,049
Jesus, I make like a jump scare noise for you.

3508
03:15:26,010 --> 03:15:28,170
No, it's just kind of right in my face.

3509
03:15:28,889 --> 03:15:33,979
Like when he attacked, it was like, um, uh,

3510
03:15:33,979 --> 03:15:36,620
I think that's like the you are going to get knocked off your horse sound.

3511
03:15:36,620 --> 03:15:43,739
The first mark of death.

3512
03:15:43,739 --> 03:15:47,950
Oh, I think that's the thing to do the boss with via, isn't it?

3513
03:15:48,750 --> 03:15:49,950
I think I have that.

3514
03:15:49,950 --> 03:15:51,549
My cat was telling me we could do that earlier.

3515
03:15:51,549 --> 03:15:55,579
And then I said, cool, we did some else.

3516
03:16:01,979 --> 03:16:09,600
Don't even do this to me.

3517
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:10,159
Oh, that's right.

3518
03:16:10,159 --> 03:16:11,760
These things, these dumb beetles don't give anything.

3519
03:16:20,520 --> 03:16:22,280
Uh, boss man.

3520
03:16:22,280 --> 03:16:26,440
Yeah, so there's usually a, um, some of those, um,

3521
03:16:26,440 --> 03:16:28,879
I get the wave, you spin it around.

3522
03:16:28,879 --> 03:16:29,840
They look like a gargoyle.

3523
03:16:47,399 --> 03:16:49,319
Now, what a fool I am.

3524
03:16:49,319 --> 03:16:51,879
I hit him in his elbow, but he has elbow guards on.

3525
03:16:52,520 --> 03:16:53,639
That was actually really dumb.

3526
03:16:54,520 --> 03:16:58,360
Oops.

3527
03:16:58,360 --> 03:17:05,530
You want to end it?

3528
03:17:07,159 --> 03:17:07,719
Go for it.

3529
03:17:08,889 --> 03:17:09,530
And twist.

3530
03:17:12,829 --> 03:17:14,989
God, I'm so freaking cool.

3531
03:17:18,459 --> 03:17:19,020
Oh my God.

3532
03:17:19,020 --> 03:17:20,219
72,000.

3533
03:17:20,219 --> 03:17:24,010
Very good.

3534
03:17:25,399 --> 03:17:27,079
Map fragment is right here.

3535
03:17:30,239 --> 03:17:31,200
Up over this.

3536
03:17:31,920 --> 03:17:35,399
Let us gamble.

3537
03:17:35,399 --> 03:17:38,200
There's no time to gamble when we just destroy it really quickly.

3538
03:17:38,200 --> 03:17:48,649
It's like a little map.

3539
03:17:48,649 --> 03:18:05,690
I need to level up.

3540
03:18:05,690 --> 03:18:06,569
Is 45 enough?

3541
03:18:06,569 --> 03:18:07,450
I should have do 50.

3542
03:18:15,959 --> 03:18:17,079
45 is not enough.

3543
03:18:17,079 --> 03:18:21,819
Do what they say.

3544
03:18:21,819 --> 03:18:26,299
Is, isn't there a, is the, what's the cap for, um, for vigor?

3545
03:18:26,299 --> 03:18:27,739
Is it 60?

3546
03:18:27,739 --> 03:18:28,620
Oh, that's right.

3547
03:18:28,620 --> 03:18:29,180
I keep forgetting.

3548
03:18:29,180 --> 03:18:31,260
I thought it was, I keep thinking that's 40.

3549
03:18:31,260 --> 03:18:32,059
Do what they say.

3550
03:18:38,219 --> 03:18:38,620
I did.

3551
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:40,569
Come on.

3552
03:18:44,139 --> 03:18:45,659
60 is the true cap.

3553
03:18:46,139 --> 03:18:52,200
Who do you think is going to be in the Giants area?

3554
03:18:56,840 --> 03:19:03,719
Uh, how could I possibly know the answer to that question?

3555
03:19:03,719 --> 03:19:05,239
I think it's going to be an ulcerated tree spirit.

3556
03:19:06,040 --> 03:19:07,879
You say that for every single one.

3557
03:19:07,879 --> 03:19:10,200
And one of these times it's going to be right.

3558
03:19:10,200 --> 03:19:12,200
Oh, he knew, he knew.

3559
03:19:12,200 --> 03:19:13,000
It's Radon.

3560
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,159
I'm going to say Radon every time because we still haven't seen him.

3561
03:19:28,780 --> 03:19:29,180
That's right.

3562
03:19:29,180 --> 03:19:29,819
It could be Radon.

3563
03:19:29,819 --> 03:19:31,260
If it is Radon, that's actually not good.

3564
03:19:31,819 --> 03:19:33,819
It's going to be a super scaled Radon.

3565
03:19:34,379 --> 03:19:36,540
This guy's covering his face because of how ugly he is.

3566
03:19:37,100 --> 03:19:38,219
Oh, he ruined it.

3567
03:19:48,319 --> 03:19:49,120
Oh, yeah.

3568
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:50,719
Our clothing is different.

3569
03:19:50,719 --> 03:19:52,719
His head's like a mushroom fungus for me.

3570
03:19:54,239 --> 03:19:55,600
His head is still covered in mine too.

3571
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:07,930
Oh wait, he goes, let chaos take the world.

3572
03:20:07,930 --> 03:20:09,129
This guy's messed up.

3573
03:20:09,129 --> 03:20:10,090
I say we take him out.

3574
03:20:11,770 --> 03:20:12,270
Hold on.

3575
03:20:22,139 --> 03:20:22,639
Hold on.

3576
03:20:27,639 --> 03:20:29,579
May chaos take.

3577
03:20:32,909 --> 03:20:33,549
There it is.

3578
03:20:33,549 --> 03:20:34,030
He said it.

3579
03:20:37,920 --> 03:20:38,719
Okay.

3580
03:20:38,719 --> 03:20:40,360
Is there a maybe a boss down here?

3581
03:21:07,069 --> 03:21:08,270
Where is it?

3582
03:21:12,270 --> 03:21:12,750
I don't know.

3583
03:21:13,690 --> 03:21:15,450
Oh, smithing stone seven.

3584
03:21:15,450 --> 03:21:15,930
Yes.

3585
03:21:15,930 --> 03:21:17,530
That means you can upgrade one of these.

3586
03:21:19,610 --> 03:21:20,250
Here's the hole.

3587
03:21:28,540 --> 03:21:29,340
Open it, peasant.

3588
03:21:33,559 --> 03:21:34,120
What's in here?

3589
03:21:34,120 --> 03:21:34,360
Come on.

3590
03:21:34,360 --> 03:21:34,860
What is it?

3591
03:21:37,079 --> 03:21:38,040
Smithing stone seven.

3592
03:21:38,680 --> 03:21:40,760
Somber smithing stone nine.

3593
03:21:40,760 --> 03:21:45,309
I need that.

3594
03:21:45,309 --> 03:21:45,709
You want it?

3595
03:21:45,709 --> 03:21:46,350
I need that.

3596
03:21:46,350 --> 03:21:46,850
Yeah.

3597
03:21:49,799 --> 03:21:50,299
I can even.

3598
03:21:50,920 --> 03:21:54,079
Somber smithing stone nine is on the ground.

3599
03:22:02,440 --> 03:22:04,040
That's fantastic news.

3600
03:22:05,879 --> 03:22:07,319
I don't know what killed him, but he died.

3601
03:22:10,489 --> 03:22:12,090
Kill chaos guy.

3602
03:22:17,340 --> 03:22:20,379
Oh, you picked on the two Elden Lord wannabes.

3603
03:22:20,379 --> 03:22:21,819
The two you picked on the wrong.

3604
03:22:21,819 --> 03:22:22,620
You're out.

3605
03:22:23,180 --> 03:22:23,680
You are.

3606
03:22:24,379 --> 03:22:25,440
Let's go.

3607
03:22:25,440 --> 03:22:26,559
Let's just get this leave.

3608
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:32,569
He's going to hit me.

3609
03:22:33,129 --> 03:22:34,809
I'll be back when I become Hokage.

3610
03:22:39,879 --> 03:22:40,680
You need to kill the.

3611
03:22:42,239 --> 03:22:42,959
Get out of the way.

3612
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:45,020
Okay.

3613
03:22:56,540 --> 03:22:56,780
All right.

3614
03:22:56,780 --> 03:22:59,420
There's a dungeon down there, but there's also.

3615
03:23:02,040 --> 03:23:07,850
Do we have to do that awful, awful village where you run away?

3616
03:23:09,629 --> 03:23:11,549
It's hopefully it's random enemies.

3617
03:23:11,549 --> 03:23:14,030
But that's a isn't that how you get to the pallet tree?

3618
03:23:14,989 --> 03:23:17,290
Yeah, we ain't doing that.

3619
03:23:17,850 --> 03:23:19,209
I don't know if it's random enemies.

3620
03:23:19,209 --> 03:23:19,850
They're not.

3621
03:23:19,850 --> 03:23:21,930
Wait, if they're invisible still, they might.

3622
03:23:22,729 --> 03:23:25,450
It was randomly invisible enemies that could be even worse.

3623
03:23:26,250 --> 03:23:29,850
I don't know if it could be any worse than something like insta backstabbing you.

3624
03:23:29,850 --> 03:23:30,569
Yeah, it's true.

3625
03:23:32,190 --> 03:23:32,750
That's true.

3626
03:23:37,239 --> 03:23:38,280
They're not invisible.

3627
03:23:40,559 --> 03:23:43,760
You get like machine gun archers that are all on the roof.

3628
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:45,440
Why would I get Botox?

3629
03:23:45,440 --> 03:23:46,799
Why would I get Botox for any reason?

3630
03:23:47,360 --> 03:23:53,319
I don't know.

3631
03:23:53,319 --> 03:23:56,840
It's called when you get out of the shower.

3632
03:23:56,840 --> 03:23:58,280
Moisturize your god damn face.

3633
03:23:58,840 --> 03:24:01,319
Do you moisturize when you get out?

3634
03:24:01,319 --> 03:24:02,360
Do you moisturize your face?

3635
03:24:03,450 --> 03:24:04,329
Immediately.

3636
03:24:04,329 --> 03:24:04,489
Right.

3637
03:24:04,489 --> 03:24:05,049
Do you know?

3638
03:24:05,049 --> 03:24:05,770
Do you actually?

3639
03:24:07,129 --> 03:24:09,530
I'm an avid moisturizer these days.

3640
03:24:09,530 --> 03:24:10,250
You very much.

3641
03:24:12,760 --> 03:24:14,520
Dry as heck out here.

3642
03:24:14,520 --> 03:24:18,680
Oh, and you're in Vegas, which I think you've been lying about, to be honest.

3643
03:24:18,680 --> 03:24:19,879
I just don't live here.

3644
03:24:21,280 --> 03:24:23,280
Yeah, I was just thinking yesterday about how...

3645
03:24:23,280 --> 03:24:24,239
I live in Kansas.

3646
03:24:24,959 --> 03:24:27,340
I was like, oh, yeah, like E3.

3647
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:28,139
No, not E3.

3648
03:24:29,100 --> 03:24:29,739
Evo was coming.

3649
03:24:29,739 --> 03:24:30,940
I was like, yeah, I want to go out to Vegas.

3650
03:24:30,940 --> 03:24:33,979
And then I'm like, wait, I'm going to realize German doesn't actually live out there.

3651
03:24:33,979 --> 03:24:34,620
And he's been lying.

3652
03:24:34,620 --> 03:24:35,579
He's like in Europe.

3653
03:24:36,700 --> 03:24:37,899
That seems like something you would do.

3654
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:44,719
Awfully quiet.

3655
03:24:44,719 --> 03:24:45,360
A couple items.

3656
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:49,440
All right, dude, I keep getting spitting stone sevens.

3657
03:24:49,440 --> 03:24:50,399
The game knows what I want.

3658
03:24:52,319 --> 03:24:57,530
Well, if I was in EU, I think that all the EU viewers right now are like, nah,

3659
03:24:57,530 --> 03:24:59,450
nah, that's fucking not happening.

3660
03:25:00,250 --> 03:25:02,969
Because it's like 4 a.m. every time I turn the stream on.

3661
03:25:02,969 --> 03:25:04,170
That would be really strange.

3662
03:25:04,969 --> 03:25:07,870
I think stone seven again.

3663
03:25:07,870 --> 03:25:09,229
Smithing stone seven again.

3664
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:12,639
Dude.

3665
03:25:12,639 --> 03:25:14,479
What's the odds of that actually happening, though?

3666
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:17,200
What's the odds that actually happening?

3667
03:25:17,200 --> 03:25:17,920
That's pretty low.

3668
03:25:18,909 --> 03:25:20,030
Watch out, we got a bong boy.

3669
03:25:21,290 --> 03:25:22,329
Oh, stung beetle.

3670
03:25:27,360 --> 03:25:29,040
Founding Reign of Stars, mate.

3671
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:29,760
Do you want to try it?

3672
03:25:32,250 --> 03:25:33,049
I have it already.

3673
03:25:33,690 --> 03:25:34,649
Founding Reign of Stars.

3674
03:25:36,299 --> 03:25:38,139
Yo, I also got it from that.

3675
03:25:38,139 --> 03:25:39,770
What are the odds of that?

3676
03:25:39,770 --> 03:25:41,579
Where'd you go?

3677
03:25:47,579 --> 03:25:47,979
Yeah, yeah.

3678
03:25:49,100 --> 03:25:51,260
We're going to have to do a starlight kid.

3679
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:55,290
We're going to do a crap session.

3680
03:25:55,290 --> 03:25:56,569
A craft.

3681
03:25:56,569 --> 03:26:00,250
I can like upgrade my moon veil and I think I can upgrade one of your swords.

3682
03:26:00,889 --> 03:26:03,760
I thought you were like, hey, man, we got to really do like a crap session.

3683
03:26:04,559 --> 03:26:05,600
We're going to have the craps table.

3684
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:06,399
I come down to Vegas.

3685
03:26:06,399 --> 03:26:07,520
We hit up the craps, man.

3686
03:26:07,520 --> 03:26:10,110
I can talk to millennial.

3687
03:26:10,110 --> 03:26:11,389
You can talk to millennia.

3688
03:26:11,389 --> 03:26:11,889
Mm hmm.

3689
03:26:13,790 --> 03:26:15,629
She's rent free in your head.

3690
03:26:18,750 --> 03:26:19,950
I've said I forgot.

3691
03:26:21,149 --> 03:26:21,649
No.

3692
03:26:28,559 --> 03:26:30,879
Yeah, you want to go to upgrade your weapon?

3693
03:26:30,879 --> 03:26:33,420
You just want to keep going.

3694
03:26:33,420 --> 03:26:33,979
Let's go through.

3695
03:26:33,979 --> 03:26:35,020
Let's get past the giant.

3696
03:26:35,020 --> 03:26:38,059
Because then once we beat giant and we burn the tree,

3697
03:26:38,700 --> 03:26:44,299
we kind of can decide when we want to end our playthrough.

3698
03:26:44,299 --> 03:26:44,799
You know what I mean?

3699
03:26:45,979 --> 03:26:49,520
Because after the giant, it's like, all right, what else do you really want to do?

3700
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:52,000
Because we can then go right to the ear tree.

3701
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:55,290
I think you just want to burn a bowl.

3702
03:26:55,290 --> 03:27:02,379
Hey, left or right, man?

3703
03:27:02,379 --> 03:27:07,959
I want the map fragment.

3704
03:27:07,959 --> 03:27:21,469
That would be so awful.

3705
03:27:24,479 --> 03:27:26,559
It's too nice, man, on horseback coming our way.

3706
03:27:27,280 --> 03:27:32,959
Imagine getting hit in both of your ears at the same time.

3707
03:27:33,760 --> 03:27:36,239
With two big ass weapons.

3708
03:27:36,239 --> 03:27:37,280
What is that?

3709
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:38,239
I can imagine.

3710
03:27:38,239 --> 03:27:39,120
I've been clapped.

3711
03:27:39,120 --> 03:27:40,159
Have you been clapped?

3712
03:27:40,159 --> 03:27:41,200
Why is that on the ground?

3713
03:27:41,200 --> 03:27:45,930
Oh, wait, this is where you fight one of the invaders.

3714
03:27:46,489 --> 03:27:52,319
I can't get off the horse.

3715
03:27:52,319 --> 03:28:02,959
Isn't this where you fight one of the manor people?

3716
03:28:03,600 --> 03:28:06,700
You fight somebody from the manor here, don't you?

3717
03:28:06,700 --> 03:28:07,420
I don't know.

3718
03:28:08,670 --> 03:28:09,709
Well, I'm asking Chad.

3719
03:28:10,879 --> 03:28:12,879
Yeah, I have his letter.

3720
03:28:12,879 --> 03:28:20,489
Am I the invader?

3721
03:28:20,489 --> 03:28:20,989
Oh.

3722
03:28:24,719 --> 03:28:25,600
Watch out.

3723
03:28:25,600 --> 03:28:26,100
Wait, what?

3724
03:28:27,059 --> 03:28:27,700
Wait, hey.

3725
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:30,239
Not cool.

3726
03:28:30,239 --> 03:28:30,799
Behind you.

3727
03:28:31,840 --> 03:28:32,639
I wasn't ready.

3728
03:28:33,280 --> 03:28:34,639
Why am I fat rolling?

3729
03:28:34,639 --> 03:28:35,920
I've been working with him the whole time.

3730
03:28:36,959 --> 03:28:39,360
Just to get you on stream, to get you here.

3731
03:28:39,360 --> 03:28:41,440
So we can finally, once and for all, prove to Strippin

3732
03:28:41,440 --> 03:28:42,639
that you're not a fucking gamer.

3733
03:28:43,520 --> 03:28:44,959
Strippin, let's go.

3734
03:28:45,920 --> 03:28:50,639
Strippin, what are you doing?

3735
03:28:58,370 --> 03:28:59,090
Get out of here.

3736
03:28:59,729 --> 03:29:08,139
I don't even know what I'm swinging at.

3737
03:29:08,139 --> 03:29:13,309
I feel like you still want to kill me.

3738
03:29:14,639 --> 03:29:15,280
Well, fine.

3739
03:29:15,280 --> 03:29:15,840
Fuck you.

3740
03:29:15,840 --> 03:29:16,879
I'll bring my own friend.

3741
03:29:17,440 --> 03:29:18,770
Oh, I can't.

3742
03:29:26,979 --> 03:29:27,540
Fuck you.

3743
03:29:42,209 --> 03:29:43,649
Hey, try to get a parry.

3744
03:29:43,649 --> 03:29:44,690
Try to get a parry.

3745
03:29:44,690 --> 03:29:45,250
I tried.

3746
03:29:45,250 --> 03:29:45,750
Ready?

3747
03:29:47,899 --> 03:29:49,500
It teleported me out already.

3748
03:29:49,500 --> 03:29:52,260
What did we even get from that?

3749
03:29:52,260 --> 03:29:55,280
A funny moment where we could fight each other for a minute.

3750
03:29:55,840 --> 03:30:00,399
Or even in the same game anymore.

3751
03:30:00,399 --> 03:30:02,979
I don't know.

3752
03:30:04,770 --> 03:30:06,770
I think that actually did break the co-op.

3753
03:30:06,770 --> 03:30:08,129
Because you were an invader.

3754
03:30:08,129 --> 03:30:08,629
Oh, I know.

3755
03:30:09,809 --> 03:30:10,530
Yeah.

3756
03:30:13,090 --> 03:30:13,809
It was for fun.

3757
03:30:13,809 --> 03:30:16,290
It was a funny stream moment.

3758
03:30:18,110 --> 03:30:19,229
And nobody won.

3759
03:30:20,690 --> 03:30:21,729
Actually, I think I can level up.

3760
03:30:25,340 --> 03:30:26,379
Wait, isn't there a...

3761
03:30:27,100 --> 03:30:29,819
Okay, while you rejoin, I have a quick pee-pee time.

3762
03:30:29,819 --> 03:30:38,260
Okay.

3763
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:40,819
Okay, I think I'm stuck in limbo here.

3764
03:30:40,819 --> 03:30:41,860
I have to restart.

3765
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:43,700
All right, yeah, we'll just do another pee break.

3766
03:30:44,260 --> 03:30:44,819
We'll be right back.

3767
03:30:45,459 --> 03:30:46,399
I'm going to restart.

3768
03:30:50,370 --> 03:30:51,010
Uh-oh.

3769
03:30:51,010 --> 03:30:59,680
I'm not really sure what to do about this.

3770
03:30:59,680 --> 03:31:03,729
I think I'm still in his game.

3771
03:31:04,610 --> 03:31:07,620
I'm ready to die.

3772
03:31:28,260 --> 03:31:29,059
There we go.

3773
03:31:29,059 --> 03:31:32,129
Wait, but am I still in his game?

3774
03:31:32,129 --> 03:31:35,040
No, I can't even touch the bonfires.

3775
03:31:37,280 --> 03:31:38,799
I have to alt-F4.

3776
03:31:38,799 --> 03:31:39,120
Wait.

3777
03:31:39,840 --> 03:31:40,079
Why?

3778
03:31:40,079 --> 03:31:40,479
What happened?

3779
03:31:42,079 --> 03:31:43,840
I'm going to lose 50,000 souls.

3780
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:46,879
But I have to...

3781
03:31:46,879 --> 03:31:47,760
I can't even quit the game.

3782
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:48,399
I have to alt-F4.

3783
03:31:49,659 --> 03:31:50,620
Separation missed?

3784
03:31:50,620 --> 03:31:51,659
I don't think I can...

3785
03:31:51,659 --> 03:31:54,219
I just tried to banish you if you were...

3786
03:31:54,219 --> 03:31:54,620
Oh, there we go.

3787
03:31:54,620 --> 03:31:55,340
Okay.

3788
03:31:55,340 --> 03:31:55,899
I think I'm good.

3789
03:31:57,170 --> 03:31:57,649
No.

3790
03:31:57,649 --> 03:31:58,450
Yeah, I got to re...

3791
03:31:58,450 --> 03:31:59,010
Wait.

3792
03:31:59,010 --> 03:31:59,969
Hold on.

3793
03:31:59,969 --> 03:32:01,010
I've opened my world.

3794
03:32:01,010 --> 03:32:02,450
I think I closed it by accident.

3795
03:32:03,090 --> 03:32:09,389
I think that's going to work now.

3796
03:32:10,190 --> 03:32:10,430
Yes.

3797
03:32:10,430 --> 03:32:10,750
Okay.

3798
03:32:12,159 --> 03:32:12,399
All right.

3799
03:32:12,399 --> 03:32:12,879
Did you pee?

3800
03:32:13,780 --> 03:32:14,340
Yeah.

3801
03:32:14,340 --> 03:32:15,059
All right.

3802
03:32:15,059 --> 03:32:15,780
It was great.

3803
03:32:15,780 --> 03:32:16,260
I did, too.

3804
03:32:17,299 --> 03:32:21,059
Did you want to buy a castle in Scotland

3805
03:32:21,059 --> 03:32:22,100
and we could live there together?

3806
03:32:24,989 --> 03:32:25,709
No.

3807
03:32:25,709 --> 03:32:26,479
Okay.

3808
03:32:30,559 --> 03:32:35,709
Oh, I got items from him dying.

3809
03:32:41,200 --> 03:32:42,319
We got the jump over there.

3810
03:32:42,319 --> 03:32:43,280
I don't know where the jumpy go.

3811
03:32:43,840 --> 03:32:47,170
Isn't there a bonfire right here?

3812
03:32:48,319 --> 03:32:48,559
Yeah.

3813
03:32:48,559 --> 03:32:49,920
Let's just get on our horses

3814
03:32:51,149 --> 03:32:52,430
right along the countryside.

3815
03:32:53,149 --> 03:32:57,059
Don't get me wrong.

3816
03:32:57,059 --> 03:32:58,420
I bet I've never been to Scotland.

3817
03:32:59,579 --> 03:32:59,899
Sounds...

3818
03:33:00,540 --> 03:33:01,739
It sounds beautiful.

3819
03:33:01,739 --> 03:33:03,020
It sounds like an incredible place.

3820
03:33:04,139 --> 03:33:04,379
But...

3821
03:33:04,940 --> 03:33:06,219
It's me that's the problem.

3822
03:33:07,180 --> 03:33:09,309
I just...

3823
03:33:09,309 --> 03:33:09,709
I don't know.

3824
03:33:13,360 --> 03:33:15,600
I feel like a bot.

3825
03:33:15,600 --> 03:33:16,479
No, there's no bot.

3826
03:33:16,479 --> 03:33:17,120
It's just like, I don't know.

3827
03:33:17,120 --> 03:33:18,559
I don't really know Scotland.

3828
03:33:18,559 --> 03:33:19,120
I like...

3829
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:21,440
It feels like you're really trying to justify

3830
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:23,280
not buying a castle in Scotland,

3831
03:33:23,280 --> 03:33:24,159
but like you...

3832
03:33:24,159 --> 03:33:24,639
I mean like...

3833
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:26,399
I don't know.

3834
03:33:26,399 --> 03:33:28,159
I got to be so nice about it.

3835
03:33:28,159 --> 03:33:29,120
Like, no, I don't want to live

3836
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:30,319
in a castle in Scotland.

3837
03:33:30,319 --> 03:33:30,799
Okay?

3838
03:33:30,799 --> 03:33:31,280
There you go.

3839
03:33:31,920 --> 03:33:32,959
That's the whole statement.

3840
03:33:32,959 --> 03:33:34,239
I don't need any more statements.

3841
03:33:34,239 --> 03:33:35,120
I thought that star...

3842
03:33:35,120 --> 03:33:35,680
Where did you go?

3843
03:33:35,680 --> 03:33:36,399
I was freaking out.

3844
03:33:43,250 --> 03:33:44,049
Oh, so we got to kill it.

3845
03:33:44,049 --> 03:33:44,610
Wait, what is...

3846
03:33:44,610 --> 03:33:44,850
I don't...

3847
03:33:45,409 --> 03:33:47,860
This jellyfish is underage?

3848
03:33:49,389 --> 03:33:50,030
What?

3849
03:33:50,030 --> 03:33:52,989
What are you looking at?

3850
03:33:53,709 --> 03:33:54,750
There's a jellyfish here

3851
03:33:54,750 --> 03:33:55,549
and it's like talking.

3852
03:33:59,100 --> 03:33:59,979
You don't see it?

3853
03:33:59,979 --> 03:34:00,219
No.

3854
03:34:03,219 --> 03:34:03,620
This gel...

3855
03:34:03,620 --> 03:34:05,540
No, but your chat's question marking.

3856
03:34:05,540 --> 03:34:06,739
The jellyfish was like...

3857
03:34:06,739 --> 03:34:07,940
You said when we were 14,

3858
03:34:07,940 --> 03:34:08,979
we'd go visit the stars.

3859
03:34:09,950 --> 03:34:11,069
There's an underage jellyfish here.

3860
03:34:11,709 --> 03:34:12,590
Not making shit up.

3861
03:34:14,190 --> 03:34:15,229
Don't you have to...

3862
03:34:15,229 --> 03:34:15,709
Wait.

3863
03:34:15,709 --> 03:34:16,270
Okay.

3864
03:34:16,270 --> 03:34:16,829
Wait, this is...

3865
03:34:16,829 --> 03:34:17,709
You have to give the...

3866
03:34:19,149 --> 03:34:20,350
Are you killing?

3867
03:34:20,350 --> 03:34:20,590
You...

3868
03:34:21,549 --> 03:34:22,270
It's gone.

3869
03:34:22,270 --> 03:34:22,590
That's...

3870
03:34:23,389 --> 03:34:24,110
I'm just saying

3871
03:34:24,670 --> 03:34:26,190
you killed the jellyfish

3872
03:34:26,829 --> 03:34:29,379
and I think that that's worse

3873
03:34:29,379 --> 03:34:30,500
than if you killed the turtle.

3874
03:34:31,870 --> 03:34:33,229
Like, I think your chat

3875
03:34:33,229 --> 03:34:34,190
probably is freaking out right now.

3876
03:34:34,190 --> 03:34:36,190
You can't prove that I killed it

3877
03:34:36,190 --> 03:34:37,229
because you couldn't even see it.

3878
03:34:40,670 --> 03:34:41,309
Pork brain.

3879
03:34:43,379 --> 03:34:44,819
Yeah, that's raw pork brain,

3880
03:34:44,819 --> 03:34:45,139
I think.

3881
03:34:46,909 --> 03:34:47,149
All right.

3882
03:34:47,149 --> 03:34:48,110
Let's keep going.

3883
03:34:48,110 --> 03:34:48,590
Let's get out of here.

3884
03:34:48,590 --> 03:34:50,750
Man, I am patient zero.

3885
03:34:52,350 --> 03:34:53,709
You're going to hear about me on the news.

3886
03:34:58,110 --> 03:34:58,750
Yeah, this is going to be...

3887
03:34:58,750 --> 03:35:00,590
This is going to be like a huge Reddit thread.

3888
03:35:01,659 --> 03:35:03,420
Like, wait, why would he have done that?

3889
03:35:04,379 --> 03:35:05,899
Would he eat pork

3890
03:35:05,899 --> 03:35:07,579
that was in a backpack for a day?

3891
03:35:10,659 --> 03:35:11,860
That's where COVID came from.

3892
03:35:11,860 --> 03:35:12,819
Was it a bet?

3893
03:35:12,819 --> 03:35:13,780
Why did he do that?

3894
03:35:13,780 --> 03:35:15,139
That seems insane to me.

3895
03:35:15,700 --> 03:35:19,649
It's Mithingstone 7 again.

3896
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:22,000
Not me.

3897
03:35:24,049 --> 03:35:25,729
And then there'll be like buried down

3898
03:35:25,729 --> 03:35:26,209
in the thread.

3899
03:35:26,209 --> 03:35:27,090
There'll be somebody like,

3900
03:35:27,090 --> 03:35:28,610
I don't understand what the big deal is.

3901
03:35:28,610 --> 03:35:29,489
I've eaten that before

3902
03:35:29,489 --> 03:35:30,690
and I felt fucking fine.

3903
03:35:31,329 --> 03:35:34,780
It's got like minus 200 fucking downvotes.

3904
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:38,639
I love scrolling to the bottom

3905
03:35:38,639 --> 03:35:39,760
and showing like seeing

3906
03:35:39,760 --> 03:35:41,600
the like controversial takes.

3907
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:42,100
I love it.

3908
03:35:48,139 --> 03:35:48,639
Who?

3909
03:35:49,340 --> 03:35:49,979
Oh, okay.

3910
03:35:50,620 --> 03:35:51,819
You just hooted him?

3911
03:35:51,819 --> 03:35:53,020
He just looked a little lost.

3912
03:36:15,340 --> 03:36:22,139
Hey, Sturd, do you want to know

3913
03:36:22,139 --> 03:36:23,819
about my playthrough lore for me?

3914
03:36:24,459 --> 03:36:25,260
Your playthrough lore?

3915
03:36:25,260 --> 03:36:25,579
Yeah.

3916
03:36:25,579 --> 03:36:27,340
I first tried this boss

3917
03:36:27,340 --> 03:36:28,540
when I was probably 20

3918
03:36:28,540 --> 03:36:30,139
to 30 levels too early finding it.

3919
03:36:31,569 --> 03:36:32,770
I never found this boss.

3920
03:36:32,770 --> 03:36:33,329
Praise me.

3921
03:36:33,329 --> 03:36:33,829
Praise me.

3922
03:36:34,610 --> 03:36:35,809
There's like you fight one of these

3923
03:36:35,809 --> 03:36:37,170
in a basement somewhere.

3924
03:36:37,170 --> 03:36:37,489
Yeah.

3925
03:36:37,489 --> 03:36:39,170
I kept seeing people on streams fight it

3926
03:36:39,170 --> 03:36:40,690
and I was like, where the fuck is this?

3927
03:36:40,690 --> 03:36:41,409
I still don't know.

3928
03:36:48,530 --> 03:36:50,129
This is like an ice dragon out here, right?

3929
03:36:56,219 --> 03:36:56,459
Okay.

3930
03:36:56,459 --> 03:36:58,299
For a second, I thought I thought

3931
03:36:58,299 --> 03:36:59,819
all of his clothes just came off.

3932
03:37:01,069 --> 03:37:01,790
They kind of did.

3933
03:37:04,129 --> 03:37:05,979
That was fun.

3934
03:37:05,979 --> 03:37:07,629
I thought I got away.

3935
03:37:07,629 --> 03:37:09,790
You thought wrong.

3936
03:37:20,530 --> 03:37:22,290
I was just mashing L1.

3937
03:37:22,290 --> 03:37:23,649
I just didn't want to even fight this thing.

3938
03:37:24,610 --> 03:37:28,219
So you're like bored of Elden Ring.

3939
03:37:30,260 --> 03:37:30,899
You want to stop.

3940
03:37:31,899 --> 03:37:32,860
We're not playing tomorrow.

3941
03:37:34,780 --> 03:37:36,620
Can we just please go straight to Elden Beast?

3942
03:37:36,620 --> 03:37:37,819
Can we just end this already?

3943
03:37:43,489 --> 03:37:44,450
No, that's not what I said.

3944
03:37:54,190 --> 03:37:55,549
Yeah, I don't even want to fight this.

3945
03:37:55,549 --> 03:37:56,270
I'm just gonna let him kill me

3946
03:37:56,270 --> 03:37:57,549
because I like don't even want to fight this.

3947
03:37:58,270 --> 03:38:00,370
I'm just like so over this.

3948
03:38:21,260 --> 03:38:23,260
Dude, why are you blinding me?

3949
03:38:54,190 --> 03:38:54,909
Cowardly tactics.

3950
03:38:55,549 --> 03:38:56,430
Dude, you got the mod

3951
03:38:56,430 --> 03:38:57,870
that every time you get hit it does that

3952
03:38:57,870 --> 03:38:58,750
to like fuck with you.

3953
03:39:00,290 --> 03:39:01,010
He's gonna kill me.

3954
03:39:01,569 --> 03:39:05,549
You're good.

3955
03:39:06,110 --> 03:39:12,899
Would you smoke a blunt

3956
03:39:12,899 --> 03:39:14,180
with the godskin apostle?

3957
03:39:14,180 --> 03:39:16,219
No, no, no way.

3958
03:39:16,860 --> 03:39:18,620
This is the type you smoke a blunt

3959
03:39:18,620 --> 03:39:19,340
with this motherfucker

3960
03:39:19,340 --> 03:39:21,420
and they start like talking about wacky shit.

3961
03:39:23,899 --> 03:39:26,700
Like, hey, do you think that we should like ever,

3962
03:39:26,700 --> 03:39:27,979
you know, like, like,

3963
03:39:27,979 --> 03:39:29,659
I think we're gonna live on the moon.

3964
03:39:29,659 --> 03:39:30,860
It's like, I don't think,

3965
03:39:30,860 --> 03:39:31,500
I don't know about that.

3966
03:39:33,889 --> 03:39:35,489
Yeah, when they sign people up

3967
03:39:35,489 --> 03:39:36,209
to go live on the moon,

3968
03:39:36,209 --> 03:39:37,010
I'll be the first one.

3969
03:39:38,850 --> 03:39:39,889
I love that you're quoting

3970
03:39:39,889 --> 03:39:42,450
a real conversation that we had with the one we did.

3971
03:39:44,479 --> 03:39:45,440
Don't remember.

3972
03:39:45,440 --> 03:39:46,879
We had like a taxi driver.

3973
03:39:47,840 --> 03:39:49,280
I mean, we're leaving Seattle

3974
03:39:50,079 --> 03:39:51,600
from like past west.

3975
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:52,959
This is a real thing.

3976
03:39:52,959 --> 03:39:54,799
This is a real bit, dude.

3977
03:39:54,799 --> 03:39:56,399
Hey, I got an ancient,

3978
03:39:56,399 --> 03:39:57,840
ancient dragon smithing stone, by the way.

3979
03:39:57,840 --> 03:39:58,719
You were looking for one of those.

3980
03:39:59,520 --> 03:40:00,799
This guy was talking about

3981
03:40:00,799 --> 03:40:02,639
sending all of the prisoners

3982
03:40:02,639 --> 03:40:04,559
from earth to the moon to colonize it,

3983
03:40:04,559 --> 03:40:05,600
just like Australia.

3984
03:40:07,059 --> 03:40:08,579
We were in a 30 minute conversation

3985
03:40:08,579 --> 03:40:09,219
with this guy.

3986
03:40:09,219 --> 03:40:09,860
What?

3987
03:40:09,860 --> 03:40:10,979
I don't remember any of this.

3988
03:40:15,489 --> 03:40:16,370
What the fuck?

3989
03:40:16,930 --> 03:40:19,329
He's no, we didn't smoke a blunt

3990
03:40:19,329 --> 03:40:21,010
with our taxi driver.

3991
03:40:21,010 --> 03:40:21,809
No, no, no, no.

3992
03:40:22,770 --> 03:40:24,530
He's just years ago.

3993
03:40:25,729 --> 03:40:26,850
I don't know.

3994
03:40:26,850 --> 03:40:27,809
Where are you sure it was you?

3995
03:40:27,809 --> 03:40:29,010
I don't know who else would be there with me.

3996
03:40:29,729 --> 03:40:30,610
Can you set it a bonfire?

3997
03:40:34,819 --> 03:40:38,850
Like enough time has gone by

3998
03:40:38,850 --> 03:40:40,610
that you don't think that guy's crazy anymore.

3999
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:43,360
You came up with that idea.

4000
03:40:43,360 --> 03:40:44,000
I'm like, wait, what?

4001
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:45,200
What's weird about that?

4002
03:40:45,200 --> 03:40:46,239
I was describing it

4003
03:40:46,239 --> 03:40:47,360
as if it was very weird

4004
03:40:47,360 --> 03:40:48,559
because I didn't want to smoke a blunt

4005
03:40:48,559 --> 03:40:49,760
with the godskin apostle

4006
03:40:49,760 --> 03:40:50,639
because he was going to start talking

4007
03:40:50,639 --> 03:40:52,079
about weird shit like that.

4008
03:40:55,260 --> 03:40:57,100
I was describing how it was weird.

4009
03:40:57,659 --> 03:40:58,750
Okay.

4010
03:40:58,750 --> 03:41:01,729
Where's there's bonfire?

4011
03:41:01,729 --> 03:41:02,129
I don't know.

4012
03:41:05,180 --> 03:41:06,860
It was the godskin apostle.

4013
03:41:08,500 --> 03:41:09,379
I don't know where I am.

4014
03:41:10,100 --> 03:41:10,420
Yeah.

4015
03:41:10,420 --> 03:41:11,940
And it's like somebody cut us off

4016
03:41:12,659 --> 03:41:14,420
and he did like they got in front of us

4017
03:41:14,420 --> 03:41:15,700
and they were like four cars in front of us

4018
03:41:15,700 --> 03:41:16,979
and he did like the fucking weird

4019
03:41:16,979 --> 03:41:18,899
gumby snake move went out of his window

4020
03:41:18,899 --> 03:41:20,100
and went in front of the guy's car

4021
03:41:20,100 --> 03:41:21,620
and gave the double middle finger to him.

4022
03:41:22,180 --> 03:41:23,940
Like in his windshield, like in front of him.

4023
03:41:25,489 --> 03:41:27,329
Then he went, he came back in the window

4024
03:41:27,329 --> 03:41:28,530
and he was like, sorry about that.

4025
03:41:28,530 --> 03:41:29,440
It's weird.

4026
03:41:29,440 --> 03:41:31,280
You don't remember any of this until now.

4027
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:32,159
Yeah.

4028
03:41:32,159 --> 03:41:33,280
It's weird that I didn't remember that

4029
03:41:33,280 --> 03:41:34,159
till right now.

4030
03:41:34,159 --> 03:41:37,809
You just want to watch me run around on a horse?

4031
03:41:38,930 --> 03:41:40,290
You should live on the moon.

4032
03:41:41,899 --> 03:41:42,780
No, I'm serious.

4033
03:41:42,780 --> 03:41:43,979
No, I'm serious.

4034
03:41:43,979 --> 03:41:51,520
It's like I need direction.

4035
03:41:51,520 --> 03:41:53,360
Yeah, we should definitely go live on the moon.

4036
03:41:54,719 --> 03:41:55,920
Yeah, dude, we should.

4037
03:41:55,920 --> 03:41:57,040
I'm serious about this.

4038
03:41:57,760 --> 03:41:59,540
Okay.

4039
03:42:07,899 --> 03:42:08,780
I can't look at my map.

4040
03:42:08,780 --> 03:42:09,819
I have to wait till

4041
03:42:09,819 --> 03:42:12,459
am I going to just show up where I died?

4042
03:42:12,459 --> 03:42:13,260
I see one.

4043
03:42:13,899 --> 03:42:20,780
Jerma, you would definitely want to go move to a castle

4044
03:42:20,780 --> 03:42:22,780
on the moon with stir

4045
03:42:22,780 --> 03:42:24,459
and you guys would make it rain

4046
03:42:24,459 --> 03:42:26,219
and you'd be able to, like a boss,

4047
03:42:26,219 --> 03:42:28,620
be able to do where is that we're going with this?

4048
03:42:31,780 --> 03:42:33,700
Every day in our content castle.

4049
03:42:35,219 --> 03:42:36,500
It's every day, bro.

4050
03:42:37,379 --> 03:42:39,059
I wouldn't want to live in a content castle

4051
03:42:39,059 --> 03:42:39,860
because you know what would happen?

4052
03:42:40,670 --> 03:42:42,590
One of us would be loud

4053
03:42:42,590 --> 03:42:45,149
and it would just bounce off of every wall in the castle

4054
03:42:45,149 --> 03:42:47,950
and it would be un-fucking-bearable.

4055
03:42:47,950 --> 03:42:49,709
You'd hear yourself for a week.

4056
03:42:50,190 --> 03:42:50,829
It would just be like,

4057
03:42:52,829 --> 03:42:54,270
it'd be like, I can't fucking stand it.

4058
03:42:54,270 --> 03:42:56,750
All these like stone walls, whatever the hell it is.

4059
03:42:58,059 --> 03:42:58,459
Okay.

4060
03:42:58,459 --> 03:42:59,659
I need to, where are you?

4061
03:43:00,989 --> 03:43:02,110
At the bonfire.

4062
03:43:04,209 --> 03:43:06,530
I went across the bridge to the bonfire.

4063
03:43:07,090 --> 03:43:08,450
Where the fuck are you?

4064
03:43:09,090 --> 03:43:10,209
Find a warfare.

4065
03:43:10,209 --> 03:43:11,409
I need my souls though.

4066
03:43:12,620 --> 03:43:14,299
It was like 140,000.

4067
03:43:14,299 --> 03:43:15,659
There was a lot of souls.

4068
03:43:15,659 --> 03:43:18,719
I'll bet you teleported anyway.

4069
03:43:18,719 --> 03:43:21,329
Well, I think it's closed.

4070
03:43:21,329 --> 03:43:21,889
Whatever.

4071
03:43:21,889 --> 03:43:25,309
Would you smoke a blunt with Peter Griffin?

4072
03:43:25,309 --> 03:43:30,379
You asking?

4073
03:43:30,379 --> 03:43:32,059
I mean, I'm just bringing it up.

4074
03:43:32,059 --> 03:43:33,540
Somebody brought it up.

4075
03:43:33,540 --> 03:43:33,860
Okay.

4076
03:43:35,139 --> 03:43:38,500
I mean, well, hold on.

4077
03:43:38,500 --> 03:43:41,379
Is Peter Griffin in my house?

4078
03:43:41,379 --> 03:43:44,379
Like, is it like, okay, we're like hanging out at my place?

4079
03:43:44,379 --> 03:43:47,899
Because the answer is no.

4080
03:43:47,899 --> 03:43:48,780
Because Peter will probably be like,

4081
03:43:48,780 --> 03:43:52,540
oh yeah, so I can like stay here now.

4082
03:43:52,540 --> 03:43:54,620
I'll be here for like a few weeks.

4083
03:43:54,620 --> 03:43:55,100
Like, no.

4084
03:43:55,819 --> 03:43:56,139
Uh-oh.

4085
03:43:58,719 --> 03:43:59,360
Where did you go?

4086
03:43:59,920 --> 03:44:02,319
I'm trying to like show you where your souls are.

4087
03:44:02,319 --> 03:44:03,040
Stay here overnight.

4088
03:44:03,840 --> 03:44:05,149
You gotta go.

4089
03:44:08,719 --> 03:44:11,280
My souls are by that urn tree.

4090
03:44:12,180 --> 03:44:12,819
Yes.

4091
03:44:12,819 --> 03:44:13,700
Across the bridge.

4092
03:44:14,340 --> 03:44:15,700
You have to go across the bridge.

4093
03:44:16,739 --> 03:44:20,510
Are you checking out?

4094
03:44:20,510 --> 03:44:21,149
Peter, you can...

4095
03:44:21,149 --> 03:44:22,110
No, I'm fine.

4096
03:44:22,670 --> 03:44:24,430
Peter, you can stay on the futon tonight,

4097
03:44:24,430 --> 03:44:26,110
but then like you gotta get the fuck out of here.

4098
03:44:39,420 --> 03:44:41,659
Why is the godskin apostle back?

4099
03:44:44,510 --> 03:44:45,149
Is he?

4100
03:44:45,149 --> 03:44:45,469
Yeah.

4101
03:44:46,190 --> 03:44:49,809
I don't see him.

4102
03:44:49,809 --> 03:44:51,409
You don't see the apostle?

4103
03:44:52,209 --> 03:44:52,450
No.

4104
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:57,680
I see you dealing damage to invisible nothing.

4105
03:44:58,239 --> 03:44:58,959
This is weird.

4106
03:44:59,680 --> 03:45:02,219
All right, well, get your runes.

4107
03:45:03,020 --> 03:45:08,719
And then we're going to go somewhere else.

4108
03:45:09,280 --> 03:45:11,840
All right, let's get out of here quick.

4109
03:45:13,739 --> 03:45:16,209
I'm not saying I couldn't handle it.

4110
03:45:16,209 --> 03:45:17,250
I just don't want to handle it.

4111
03:45:17,809 --> 03:45:21,409
You don't want to handle Peter Griffin.

4112
03:45:21,969 --> 03:45:26,770
Yeah, two weeks later, he's in his underwear with a 12-pack on your front.

4113
03:45:26,770 --> 03:45:27,760
That's what I mean.

4114
03:45:28,479 --> 03:45:35,579
And then he would like request really specific snacks, right?

4115
03:45:35,579 --> 03:45:38,379
And he'd be like, god damn it, Peter Griffin family guy shit.

4116
03:45:38,379 --> 03:45:42,540
He'd be like, hey, remember those slim jims that were spicy back in the 90s?

4117
03:45:42,540 --> 03:45:44,299
You gotta go find me some of those.

4118
03:45:44,299 --> 03:45:47,020
And it's like, oh, he's making a reference to something old.

4119
03:45:48,739 --> 03:45:49,059
Wow.

4120
03:45:49,059 --> 03:45:50,340
That's something you would never do.

4121
03:45:59,520 --> 03:46:00,000
Yeah.

4122
03:46:00,000 --> 03:46:02,079
Can you even go make maybe some clam chowder?

4123
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:10,620
Peter, that takes all day.

4124
03:46:13,620 --> 03:46:18,979
No, he's crashing at our castle in Scotland.

4125
03:46:23,229 --> 03:46:24,430
OK, we need to go.

4126
03:46:24,430 --> 03:46:25,629
I need to sit down on the bonfire.

4127
03:46:26,190 --> 03:46:27,229
I think we went backwards.

4128
03:46:27,229 --> 03:46:27,709
I don't.

4129
03:46:27,709 --> 03:46:28,190
I'm lost.

4130
03:46:28,750 --> 03:46:30,610
This is definitely backwards.

4131
03:46:31,170 --> 03:46:32,690
We need to go.

4132
03:46:32,690 --> 03:46:33,250
We were.

4133
03:46:33,969 --> 03:46:35,649
All right, let me let me go spend these, please.

4134
03:46:40,190 --> 03:46:40,590
Sit down.

4135
03:46:40,590 --> 03:46:41,629
Let me spend it.

4136
03:46:41,629 --> 03:46:42,670
We did a full circle.

4137
03:46:43,549 --> 03:46:45,069
Well, we were talking that happened.

4138
03:46:45,069 --> 03:46:47,790
Well, let's let's teleport to the ancient snow valley,

4139
03:46:47,790 --> 03:46:52,590
worm runes or some teleport somewhere where it's it's right here.

4140
03:46:54,719 --> 03:46:57,520
Teleporting the loading screen would take longer for us just to walk here.

4141
03:46:57,520 --> 03:46:58,959
I didn't know it was right here.

4142
03:46:58,959 --> 03:47:00,319
Come on, man.

4143
03:47:00,319 --> 03:47:01,600
Wait, hold on a second.

4144
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:02,559
Wait, what?

4145
03:47:02,559 --> 03:47:03,040
Hold on.

4146
03:47:03,040 --> 03:47:04,239
Wait, it's underneath us.

4147
03:47:05,409 --> 03:47:10,370
Oh, turns out it wasn't right here.

4148
03:47:11,629 --> 03:47:14,590
Someone's got an egg face, egg face.

4149
03:47:14,590 --> 03:47:17,790
The correct way to go is I forget the correct way to go.

4150
03:47:17,790 --> 03:47:21,600
There's a mogul like where's the big crucible thing?

4151
03:47:22,159 --> 03:47:24,620
That's the direction we need to go that way.

4152
03:47:24,620 --> 03:47:24,940
I think.

4153
03:47:32,290 --> 03:47:33,649
Wait, isn't there a teleporter here?

4154
03:47:35,120 --> 03:47:38,799
There's a teleporter down somewhere like right around here, isn't there?

4155
03:47:39,360 --> 03:47:41,440
I don't remember.

4156
03:47:42,000 --> 03:47:45,899
It definitely is not here.

4157
03:47:46,139 --> 03:47:51,329
Okay, we got to go that way that way.

4158
03:47:52,370 --> 03:47:53,649
I found the big cup.

4159
03:47:56,850 --> 03:47:57,329
Follow me.

4160
03:47:59,409 --> 03:48:01,409
I am going to you.

4161
03:48:03,020 --> 03:48:03,260
Yep.

4162
03:48:03,260 --> 03:48:04,540
There's the big yes, commander.

4163
03:48:05,100 --> 03:48:17,219
You're the smoke of one with Homer.

4164
03:48:17,219 --> 03:48:20,879
No, I'd rather smoke a blunt with Marge like Marge would be way chiller.

4165
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:27,250
I just got half health.

4166
03:48:27,250 --> 03:48:28,610
Where did this guy come from?

4167
03:48:29,170 --> 03:48:31,500
What was he following us?

4168
03:48:32,479 --> 03:48:33,280
He's invisible to me.

4169
03:48:33,920 --> 03:48:34,639
This is all you.

4170
03:48:35,520 --> 03:48:36,159
Never mind.

4171
03:48:36,159 --> 03:48:37,040
He got full health again.

4172
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:38,959
All right, we got to let's we got to go.

4173
03:48:39,920 --> 03:48:40,799
Can we make this jump?

4174
03:48:41,600 --> 03:48:42,000
No way.

4175
03:48:43,219 --> 03:48:43,860
All the way around.

4176
03:48:44,979 --> 03:48:45,700
I'm going down.

4177
03:48:46,260 --> 03:48:47,299
No, no, no, no, don't.

4178
03:48:47,299 --> 03:48:48,260
I can't.

4179
03:48:48,260 --> 03:48:49,299
I'm already committed.

4180
03:48:49,299 --> 03:48:50,340
You've committed already.

4181
03:48:50,340 --> 03:48:51,379
Are you serious, dude?

4182
03:48:51,379 --> 03:48:52,579
There's no way back up.

4183
03:48:52,579 --> 03:48:52,979
What do you mean?

4184
03:48:52,979 --> 03:48:53,940
There's no way back up.

4185
03:48:54,500 --> 03:48:56,420
You went can't fucking jump up a cliff.

4186
03:48:57,139 --> 03:49:00,940
We need to go that way.

4187
03:49:01,659 --> 03:49:02,860
Tell me where I need to go again.

4188
03:49:03,500 --> 03:49:05,260
You're going to find my hands in your jaw.

4189
03:49:07,600 --> 03:49:09,040
In like, yeah.

4190
03:49:09,440 --> 03:49:10,399
What do you?

4191
03:49:10,399 --> 03:49:12,559
Yeah, like I'm going to put my hand in your mouth.

4192
03:49:12,559 --> 03:49:13,600
Is he going the wrong way?

4193
03:49:15,809 --> 03:49:16,930
He's not going the right way, is he?

4194
03:49:23,250 --> 03:49:23,729
I don't know.

4195
03:49:23,729 --> 03:49:24,770
He's going the right way.

4196
03:49:24,770 --> 03:49:27,409
We just went in circles for like 20 minutes.

4197
03:49:27,409 --> 03:49:28,690
I just figured anywhere else.

4198
03:49:28,690 --> 03:49:30,610
I'm going to fucking die trying to do what you just did.

4199
03:49:32,450 --> 03:49:33,729
There's a there's a thing up here.

4200
03:49:33,729 --> 03:49:36,049
You can teleport to me if you dare.

4201
03:49:36,049 --> 03:49:37,409
Let me prove that I can do this.

4202
03:49:40,770 --> 03:49:43,090
Yeah, and then this is the giant frozen lake

4203
03:49:43,090 --> 03:49:44,850
and you go across and then the dragon's like.

4204
03:49:45,010 --> 03:49:54,739
Well, thanks to you, I lost like 4000 viewers, by the way,

4205
03:49:54,739 --> 03:49:57,219
because of shit like that because because of me.

4206
03:49:58,020 --> 03:49:59,420
Oh, well, guess what?

4207
03:49:59,420 --> 03:50:00,379
They all came over here.

4208
03:50:05,180 --> 03:50:08,780
You're doing like Peter Griffin impression traders because of you.

4209
03:50:09,500 --> 03:50:15,870
All right.

4210
03:50:15,870 --> 03:50:17,149
Thank God I can level up.

4211
03:50:23,459 --> 03:50:24,979
Can somebody help me?

4212
03:50:24,979 --> 03:50:25,940
Why can I?

4213
03:50:25,940 --> 03:50:27,700
Why did I lose access to leveling?

4214
03:50:33,260 --> 03:50:34,059
I don't know.

4215
03:50:34,059 --> 03:50:36,079
That doesn't sound right.

4216
03:50:38,700 --> 03:50:40,700
Maybe stuff still messed up for when you were an invader.

4217
03:50:54,750 --> 03:51:01,649
I think I think my game is a little messed up.

4218
03:51:02,450 --> 03:51:02,930
Delete it.

4219
03:51:06,139 --> 03:51:10,459
I have I cannot level up, so I'm just going to restart.

4220
03:51:10,459 --> 03:51:12,059
I'm going to restart the game.

4221
03:51:12,059 --> 03:51:12,620
I'm banishing.

4222
03:51:13,629 --> 03:51:14,829
Yeah, you know what?

4223
03:51:14,829 --> 03:51:16,270
No, don't even I'm just going to quit.

4224
03:51:16,270 --> 03:51:16,989
I'm going to exit.

4225
03:51:17,549 --> 03:51:19,059
I can't even exit the game.

4226
03:51:19,059 --> 03:51:20,500
It's been a problem ever since.

4227
03:51:20,500 --> 03:51:21,459
OK, all right.

4228
03:51:21,459 --> 03:51:22,100
Did you banish?

4229
03:51:22,739 --> 03:51:24,340
Yeah, all right.

4230
03:51:25,139 --> 03:51:28,659
For some reason, it doesn't let you exit the game if you're in co-op.

4231
03:51:28,659 --> 03:51:30,420
It really doesn't like the fact that I was an invader.

4232
03:51:30,420 --> 03:51:38,860
I think it broke it.

4233
03:51:38,860 --> 03:51:39,500
There it is.

4234
03:51:39,500 --> 03:51:40,139
OK, let me.

4235
03:51:45,299 --> 03:51:46,780
Why am I just leveling up?

4236
03:51:46,780 --> 03:51:52,989
OK, can you put the thing down again?

4237
03:51:54,190 --> 03:51:54,829
All right.

4238
03:52:12,879 --> 03:52:14,719
Come on, I need to get to 58.

4239
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:16,399
Come on.

4240
03:52:26,020 --> 03:52:27,219
Dude, you have star muted.

4241
03:52:27,219 --> 03:52:28,100
I wouldn't be surprised.

4242
03:52:30,850 --> 03:52:34,530
He's got to learn that he has to his behavior has to improve.

4243
03:52:34,530 --> 03:52:35,170
Wait in line.

4244
03:52:35,969 --> 03:52:39,780
I am not you're not muted.

4245
03:52:39,780 --> 03:52:41,860
I'm just trying to level up in case it happens again.

4246
03:52:42,579 --> 03:52:46,879
Is your thing?

4247
03:52:47,920 --> 03:52:50,989
I'm using maybe it's messed up because it's not Monday

4248
03:52:50,989 --> 03:52:52,350
and we were supposed to play on Monday.

4249
03:52:52,350 --> 03:52:52,590
Shit.

4250
03:52:52,590 --> 03:52:53,149
That's right.

4251
03:52:53,149 --> 03:52:53,549
All right.

4252
03:52:53,549 --> 03:52:54,190
Is your thing down?

4253
03:52:55,170 --> 03:52:55,409
Yeah.

4254
03:53:14,340 --> 03:53:16,659
Let's see what the dragon is.

4255
03:53:16,659 --> 03:53:19,420
I don't know if we can find it.

4256
03:53:19,420 --> 03:53:22,299
I don't because normally this area would turn into like a mist.

4257
03:53:22,299 --> 03:53:23,979
I think we have to actually walk over here.

4258
03:53:36,479 --> 03:53:36,799
Hit him.

4259
03:53:37,680 --> 03:53:38,079
Hit him.

4260
03:53:38,079 --> 03:53:38,799
Hit him again.

4261
03:53:38,799 --> 03:53:39,440
Keep hitting him.

4262
03:53:44,190 --> 03:53:45,229
It is the dragon.

4263
03:53:45,469 --> 03:53:49,709
I think it's just the ice dragon going to fight it.

4264
03:53:52,190 --> 03:53:53,229
Guess we have to.

4265
03:53:56,110 --> 03:53:57,069
Maybe it's a different dragon.

4266
03:53:57,629 --> 03:54:01,870
I can't see anything.

4267
03:54:02,750 --> 03:54:04,030
Is this the right one?

4268
03:54:04,030 --> 03:54:04,530
Dula?

4269
03:54:05,149 --> 03:54:05,950
No.

4270
03:54:05,950 --> 03:54:29,329
Oh, I do love mercy on the poor boss.

4271
03:54:36,690 --> 03:54:38,129
I got stuff growing on them.

4272
03:54:38,770 --> 03:55:01,659
Oh, what?

4273
03:55:01,659 --> 03:55:02,540
Oh, we fell down.

4274
03:55:04,639 --> 03:55:10,319
Oh, very cool.

4275
03:55:12,340 --> 03:55:12,659
Damn.

4276
03:55:12,659 --> 03:55:14,500
That's another hundred and twenty five K.

4277
03:55:14,500 --> 03:55:15,620
You're for a storm.

4278
03:55:16,420 --> 03:55:19,520
What a thematically appropriate.

4279
03:55:19,520 --> 03:55:20,479
I didn't bring the drop.

4280
03:55:21,200 --> 03:55:26,739
We could definitely be millennia.

4281
03:55:28,909 --> 03:55:33,149
Maybe I actually have three times the HP I did when we were trying it.

4282
03:55:33,149 --> 03:55:37,790
I want my swords to be leveled up another once two or three times.

4283
03:55:37,790 --> 03:55:39,709
I want to get them to at least plus 20 before we do that.

4284
03:55:39,709 --> 03:55:42,430
OK, so earlier when I said let's go do some like leveling up

4285
03:55:42,430 --> 03:55:45,549
because we've got a whole bunch of Smith's stones and you said no.

4286
03:55:47,409 --> 03:55:49,329
Was that so that we wouldn't have to fight millennia?

4287
03:55:49,969 --> 03:55:50,129
No.

4288
03:55:51,500 --> 03:55:52,860
Right after that, I was like, no, you know what?

4289
03:55:52,860 --> 03:55:53,500
Let's get out of here.

4290
03:55:54,139 --> 03:55:57,569
You got another ancient.

4291
03:55:57,569 --> 03:55:59,170
I have two ancient dragon spinning stones.

4292
03:56:02,909 --> 03:56:03,790
Do you want me just to give them to you?

4293
03:56:05,389 --> 03:56:05,629
Sure.

4294
03:56:09,729 --> 03:56:11,010
I'll be your stone master.

4295
03:56:11,010 --> 03:56:11,729
Remember to level up.

4296
03:56:11,729 --> 03:56:13,969
We just got a lot of room.

4297
03:56:13,969 --> 03:56:15,250
And make sure you grab those.

4298
03:56:15,250 --> 03:56:18,129
There's two omega items on the ground.

4299
03:56:18,129 --> 03:56:18,770
Yeah, I don't want them.

4300
03:56:22,909 --> 03:56:23,950
Molina is picking them up.

4301
03:56:27,090 --> 03:56:29,090
I'm afraid to sit down because I don't want them to disappear.

4302
03:56:33,090 --> 03:56:33,569
Pick them up.

4303
03:56:33,569 --> 03:56:33,969
Pick them up.

4304
03:56:33,969 --> 03:56:34,450
Pick them up.

4305
03:56:36,030 --> 03:56:37,469
I didn't concern me.

4306
03:56:37,469 --> 03:56:38,670
You can put them back down.

4307
03:56:39,309 --> 03:56:40,670
I thought you crashed.

4308
03:56:40,670 --> 03:56:43,309
And I thought it was going to make you move or something.

4309
03:56:43,870 --> 03:56:44,750
I thought you crashed.

4310
03:56:45,389 --> 03:56:46,110
Okay.

4311
03:56:46,110 --> 03:56:48,559
I got them.

4312
03:56:48,559 --> 03:56:58,540
Oh, there's a there's a what the heck?

4313
03:56:59,340 --> 03:57:00,379
There's a jail right here.

4314
03:57:01,180 --> 03:57:03,469
Let's do it.

4315
03:57:03,469 --> 03:57:05,950
Might as well.

4316
03:57:11,819 --> 03:57:12,620
In it.

4317
03:57:12,620 --> 03:57:12,940
Where is it?

4318
03:57:12,940 --> 03:57:13,579
In it.

4319
03:57:13,579 --> 03:57:14,780
I think up the hill a little bit.

4320
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:19,809
It's normally the pro tag is in here.

4321
03:57:23,579 --> 03:57:23,899
In it.

4322
03:57:27,760 --> 03:57:29,440
What the hell was that?

4323
03:57:30,079 --> 03:57:31,040
Oh, my God.

4324
03:57:31,040 --> 03:57:31,680
Assassin.

4325
03:57:32,559 --> 03:57:35,200
Well, we just got collateral.

4326
03:57:36,000 --> 03:57:49,920
There's your sniper still here.

4327
03:57:53,260 --> 03:57:54,299
No, he's gone.

4328
03:58:01,860 --> 03:58:03,860
That was that was surprising.

4329
03:58:04,420 --> 03:58:05,700
My cat loves watching you.

4330
03:58:07,299 --> 03:58:07,860
That's cute.

4331
03:58:08,420 --> 03:58:24,479
All right.

4332
03:58:24,479 --> 03:58:26,000
The chain.

4333
03:58:27,360 --> 03:58:34,100
That guy was big and strong and his muscles were bulging out of his freaking skin.

4334
03:58:35,059 --> 03:58:37,389
We're going to go up this way.

4335
03:58:38,590 --> 03:58:40,190
There is a bonfire up here.

4336
03:58:40,909 --> 03:58:45,729
I thought there was a jail here.

4337
03:58:45,729 --> 03:58:48,450
I don't see it.

4338
03:58:50,750 --> 03:58:51,469
Are you looking?

4339
03:58:52,270 --> 03:58:53,180
I looked.

4340
03:58:53,899 --> 03:58:55,500
Do you have eyes?

4341
03:58:55,500 --> 03:58:56,860
I mean, I skimmed it.

4342
03:58:56,860 --> 03:58:57,659
I scanned it.

4343
03:58:58,459 --> 03:59:16,739
Oh, that's right.

4344
03:59:16,739 --> 03:59:17,620
There's this place here.

4345
03:59:18,180 --> 03:59:28,079
Somebody said we technically did the final assassination mission.

4346
03:59:28,799 --> 03:59:31,200
So we should be able to turn that in and just go right to right card.

4347
03:59:33,840 --> 03:59:35,280
If you want to be technical about it.

4348
03:59:43,549 --> 03:59:44,909
I think stone eight.

4349
03:59:46,659 --> 03:59:49,299
OK, I've been waiting for this the whole game is up here.

4350
03:59:49,299 --> 03:59:51,700
I can finally get rivers of blood and play my real build.

4351
03:59:52,420 --> 03:59:56,209
Forgot about right card.

4352
03:59:56,209 --> 03:59:56,610
Yeah.

4353
03:59:56,610 --> 03:59:57,170
We did, too.

4354
04:00:01,420 --> 04:00:02,540
Don't look down.

4355
04:00:08,020 --> 04:00:08,500
All right.

4356
04:00:08,500 --> 04:00:10,260
If it's radan, I owe you 20 bucks.

4357
04:00:10,260 --> 04:00:12,579
If it's also rated three spirit, you owe me 50 bucks.

4358
04:00:13,809 --> 04:00:14,129
OK.

4359
04:00:14,770 --> 04:00:17,139
I'm that confident.

4360
04:00:17,780 --> 04:00:24,750
And if it's general grievous.

4361
04:00:25,629 --> 04:00:27,149
It's general grievous.

4362
04:00:27,870 --> 04:00:28,190
Yeah.

4363
04:00:28,190 --> 04:00:29,629
There'll be ones back there.

4364
04:00:29,629 --> 04:00:30,510
Then we both.

4365
04:00:34,049 --> 04:00:38,209
See, I was trying to say grievous, but general grievous is a POE guy.

4366
04:00:39,010 --> 04:00:42,879
Oh, you covered for me.

4367
04:00:42,879 --> 04:00:44,159
Aaron, here's your cool.

4368
04:00:44,799 --> 04:00:47,229
Let me be clear.

4369
04:00:50,059 --> 04:00:53,409
All right.

4370
04:00:54,530 --> 04:00:55,250
This is not.

4371
04:00:56,129 --> 04:00:56,780
The way.

4372
04:00:57,500 --> 04:00:58,059
No, it's not.

4373
04:00:58,059 --> 04:00:58,700
I was just looking.

4374
04:00:58,700 --> 04:00:59,659
I was just taking a peek.

4375
04:01:23,139 --> 04:01:24,899
Oh, tarnish mine.

4376
04:01:25,540 --> 04:01:27,780
Your peepee is too small.

4377
04:01:27,780 --> 04:01:29,219
And they're laying there.

4378
04:01:29,940 --> 04:01:32,340
You must grow two inches.

4379
04:01:33,540 --> 04:01:52,500
I can see it was bonfire.

4380
04:01:53,059 --> 04:01:58,770
Tony said, dude, the vibes are rotten right now.

4381
04:02:00,159 --> 04:02:00,719
Are they?

4382
04:02:00,719 --> 04:02:02,079
Sorry, I don't think so.

4383
04:02:02,079 --> 04:02:02,559
I don't know.

4384
04:02:04,690 --> 04:02:05,889
I don't think the vibes are rotten.

4385
04:02:13,760 --> 04:02:15,120
It's not this way.

4386
04:02:15,120 --> 04:02:16,879
But this way, there's I see like a tree.

4387
04:02:26,340 --> 04:02:27,459
Oh, actually worth.

4388
04:02:27,459 --> 04:02:28,819
Oh, dude.

4389
04:02:28,819 --> 04:02:29,459
It was a good thing.

4390
04:02:29,459 --> 04:02:30,420
I went to that tree.

4391
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:30,659
Why?

4392
04:02:31,459 --> 04:02:35,139
I actually got for real carrying greatsword this time.

4393
04:02:35,139 --> 04:02:36,020
Like, for real.

4394
04:02:36,020 --> 04:02:36,659
Not a joke.

4395
04:02:37,780 --> 04:02:39,700
Actual carrying greatsword.

4396
04:02:39,700 --> 04:02:40,739
You're fucking with me.

4397
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:42,479
What?

4398
04:02:42,479 --> 04:02:43,280
You're fucking with me.

4399
04:02:44,079 --> 04:02:44,559
No, I'm not.

4400
04:02:46,959 --> 04:02:47,440
You got it.

4401
04:02:48,239 --> 04:02:49,620
Yeah, dude.

4402
04:02:49,620 --> 04:02:50,899
No, you're screwing with me right now.

4403
04:02:50,899 --> 04:02:51,540
You're lying.

4404
04:02:51,540 --> 04:02:53,459
There's no way you got carrying greatsword.

4405
04:02:53,860 --> 04:02:56,979
That's something that you would lie about because that's so unbelievable.

4406
04:02:57,860 --> 04:02:59,579
I don't know if I believe you.

4407
04:03:00,459 --> 04:03:01,809
We're doing a bit.

4408
04:03:02,690 --> 04:03:02,930
Yes.

4409
04:03:03,889 --> 04:03:12,459
Oh, Lord, Lord, this guy's got two fingers.

4410
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:15,760
This hand has got two fingers, dude.

4411
04:03:21,819 --> 04:03:27,100
He does with the Giants, like cutting their fingers off or something.

4412
04:03:27,899 --> 04:03:30,780
And he's got he's got he's got tree stuff growing out of his arm.

4413
04:03:30,780 --> 04:03:31,579
He's a tree.

4414
04:03:31,579 --> 04:03:32,379
Giants are trees.

4415
04:03:32,940 --> 04:03:35,819
Their hands are their brains and stirs right all along.

4416
04:03:35,819 --> 04:03:38,139
But why would they why would they be cutting their fingers off?

4417
04:03:38,139 --> 04:03:38,540
I wonder.

4418
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:45,520
They aren't.

4419
04:03:45,520 --> 04:03:46,799
They are missing a lot of arms.

4420
04:03:46,799 --> 04:03:49,120
They're missing the three fingers, aren't they?

4421
04:03:49,680 --> 04:03:51,760
Like the bad ones, right?

4422
04:03:51,760 --> 04:03:53,200
Yeah, they're missing the bad boys.

4423
04:03:54,700 --> 04:03:57,280
Huh, that actually is interesting.

4424
04:04:02,239 --> 04:04:04,159
Maybe they're trying to commune with the greater will.

4425
04:04:04,959 --> 04:04:06,879
Yeah, maybe that's interesting.

4426
04:04:07,680 --> 04:04:11,120
You just unlock some new vibes from me here.

4427
04:04:12,000 --> 04:04:13,440
Wow, I saved the vibe.

4428
04:04:14,239 --> 04:04:14,879
All right, you ready?

4429
04:04:15,440 --> 04:04:17,059
Let's do it.

4430
04:04:17,780 --> 04:04:19,219
Yes, am I?

4431
04:04:20,260 --> 04:04:21,379
And by the chain.

4432
04:04:21,379 --> 04:04:22,020
But let's do it.

4433
04:04:22,020 --> 04:04:24,020
We need to go a completely different direction.

4434
04:04:24,579 --> 04:04:25,540
But there's an item over here.

4435
04:04:26,100 --> 04:04:27,200
No, it's not.

4436
04:04:28,319 --> 04:04:29,040
Stinky item.

4437
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:29,600
No, it's right here.

4438
04:04:30,239 --> 04:04:33,569
Vibes have been restored.

4439
04:04:33,569 --> 04:04:34,129
Yeah, a little.

4440
04:04:37,090 --> 04:04:37,809
Oh, yeah, that's right.

4441
04:04:37,809 --> 04:04:39,170
It's a little spot right here.

4442
04:04:39,170 --> 04:04:39,969
OK, here we go.

4443
04:04:40,850 --> 04:04:42,049
What is the boss?

4444
04:04:42,850 --> 04:04:43,809
It's through here.

4445
04:04:45,069 --> 04:04:46,209
What is it?

4446
04:04:46,209 --> 04:04:47,170
We're done.

4447
04:04:47,170 --> 04:04:52,299
Do we let let them bet?

4448
04:04:52,299 --> 04:04:53,180
Will we go in?

4449
04:04:53,899 --> 04:04:54,860
I'll let them bet.

4450
04:04:56,540 --> 04:04:57,260
Vote or die.

4451
04:05:04,030 --> 04:05:05,309
It's going to be a boat guy.

4452
04:05:05,309 --> 04:05:05,950
That would be funny.

4453
04:05:08,209 --> 04:05:09,809
We haven't seen a lot of boat guys.

4454
04:05:10,780 --> 04:05:15,059
No, our bosses cannot spawn again.

4455
04:05:15,700 --> 04:05:19,540
So Melania is in that manor spot permanently.

4456
04:05:19,540 --> 04:05:20,819
Same thing with Eldenbeast.

4457
04:05:27,579 --> 04:05:28,620
Alaketh, that's right.

4458
04:05:28,620 --> 04:05:29,260
That could be bad.

4459
04:05:30,219 --> 04:05:31,340
Got a big skull down here.

4460
04:05:36,020 --> 04:05:37,219
Guy's looking kind of dead.

4461
04:05:42,209 --> 04:05:42,850
All in.

4462
04:05:43,739 --> 04:05:44,459
Don't.

4463
04:05:44,459 --> 04:05:45,899
Oh, OK, some people are going all in.

4464
04:05:47,090 --> 04:05:49,409
This is 20 million channel points.

4465
04:05:49,409 --> 04:05:50,690
They're saying we're going to do it.

4466
04:05:50,690 --> 04:05:51,329
I'll hold up.

4467
04:05:51,329 --> 04:05:52,049
I'm predicting.

4468
04:05:52,690 --> 04:05:53,489
Are you voting?

4469
04:05:54,370 --> 04:05:57,700
Yeah, you got like two seconds.

4470
04:05:59,780 --> 04:06:00,340
I missed it.

4471
04:06:01,219 --> 04:06:03,600
OK, here we go.

4472
04:06:03,600 --> 04:06:04,000
What is it?

4473
04:06:10,049 --> 04:06:11,090
It's Horoloo.

4474
04:06:12,290 --> 04:06:13,170
The fire version.

4475
04:06:15,940 --> 04:06:17,540
It's phase two Horoloo.

4476
04:06:18,819 --> 04:06:19,940
It's the grab hat.

4477
04:06:19,940 --> 04:06:20,819
He's going to grab you.

4478
04:06:25,389 --> 04:06:26,750
Just run away from him for a second.

4479
04:06:27,309 --> 04:06:40,079
He's trying to grab me.

4480
04:06:40,079 --> 04:06:40,879
Oh, shit.

4481
04:06:41,600 --> 04:06:47,309
Oh, shit.

4482
04:06:47,309 --> 04:06:47,790
He got me.

4483
04:06:48,510 --> 04:06:49,389
He just powerbombed me.

4484
04:06:50,110 --> 04:06:51,950
Take aggro.

4485
04:06:54,940 --> 04:06:57,659
This is actually a pretty funny fight to be on a horse.

4486
04:06:57,659 --> 04:07:00,459
I don't even know if he can grab you off your horse.

4487
04:07:00,459 --> 04:07:01,100
I think he can.

4488
04:07:02,139 --> 04:07:03,340
Let's horse this guy down.

4489
04:07:10,290 --> 04:07:10,790
Uh-oh.

4490
04:07:11,569 --> 04:07:12,069
Star.

4491
04:07:12,930 --> 04:07:13,430
Star.

4492
04:07:14,290 --> 04:07:16,819
He's going to get you.

4493
04:07:20,979 --> 04:07:23,059
This is actually fucking scary.

4494
04:07:23,059 --> 04:07:24,579
I feel like I'm playing a horror game.

4495
04:07:25,299 --> 04:07:33,709
Why did you just go in?

4496
04:07:33,709 --> 04:07:34,670
Why did you do that?

4497
04:07:34,670 --> 04:07:37,389
Because it was under the snow and I thought there was a snow buffer.

4498
04:07:44,819 --> 04:07:45,219
Oh, no.

4499
04:07:45,219 --> 04:07:48,020
So when people are like, my points, they're going to do it.

4500
04:07:48,739 --> 04:07:52,579
I think we are.

4501
04:07:53,139 --> 04:07:54,799
I can't lock onto him anymore.

4502
04:07:54,799 --> 04:07:57,280
So that's not helping.

4503
04:08:00,690 --> 04:08:03,489
This white asshole is riding around these horses.

4504
04:08:03,489 --> 04:08:04,450
This is so unfair.

4505
04:08:14,770 --> 04:08:15,569
He couldn't grab me.

4506
04:08:18,139 --> 04:08:21,010
He should have, but he could not.

4507
04:08:22,209 --> 04:08:23,090
What the fuck?

4508
04:08:32,530 --> 04:08:34,049
I can't lock onto him, dude.

4509
04:08:34,770 --> 04:08:35,409
Neither can I.

4510
04:08:36,209 --> 04:08:55,200
Oh, shit.

4511
04:08:55,200 --> 04:08:55,760
He's doing it.

4512
04:08:58,940 --> 04:09:00,690
I'm under the ground.

4513
04:09:07,649 --> 04:09:08,290
Oh, he's got me.

4514
04:09:15,329 --> 04:09:17,889
He's he's beard.

4515
04:09:17,889 --> 04:09:18,770
He's teleported.

4516
04:09:21,100 --> 04:09:21,979
He is having trouble.

4517
04:09:21,979 --> 04:09:22,940
He's like a hologram.

4518
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:41,760
Oh, we're going to get really cocky here, I think.

4519
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:42,719
And it's going to be a downfall.

4520
04:09:43,680 --> 04:09:44,479
Holy shit.

4521
04:09:47,459 --> 04:09:47,780
Wow.

4522
04:09:47,780 --> 04:09:49,459
I didn't think I would hit me that high up.

4523
04:09:49,459 --> 04:09:51,059
Who would program that hitbox?

4524
04:09:51,780 --> 04:09:54,260
Fuck hockey.

4525
04:09:54,260 --> 04:09:55,780
I just can't lock onto this shit.

4526
04:09:57,600 --> 04:09:58,239
Oh, fuck.

4527
04:09:58,879 --> 04:10:03,520
All right.

4528
04:10:03,520 --> 04:10:04,239
Just hit him one time.

4529
04:10:04,239 --> 04:10:05,120
One time.

4530
04:10:05,120 --> 04:10:06,239
Hit him one time.

4531
04:10:06,620 --> 04:10:07,180
Well, can you?

4532
04:10:10,100 --> 04:10:10,979
Sorry, doubters.

4533
04:10:11,620 --> 04:10:12,979
It's too bad I didn't get my vote in.

4534
04:10:15,180 --> 04:10:16,219
Wait a minute.

4535
04:10:16,219 --> 04:10:17,020
There's a no.

4536
04:10:17,020 --> 04:10:17,579
Wait a minute.

4537
04:10:17,579 --> 04:10:19,020
Wait, don't pay it out yet.

4538
04:10:19,020 --> 04:10:20,219
Don't pay it out yet.

4539
04:10:20,219 --> 04:10:21,180
They paid it out.

4540
04:10:21,979 --> 04:10:23,760
They scammed everyone.

4541
04:10:23,760 --> 04:10:24,479
This is dude.

4542
04:10:24,479 --> 04:10:25,520
Is this a mega scam?

4543
04:10:26,159 --> 04:10:26,559
Uh oh.

4544
04:10:27,280 --> 04:10:35,459
I skipped.

4545
04:10:37,469 --> 04:10:39,709
Look, I transformed into a wolf.

4546
04:10:40,350 --> 04:10:42,909
That's that would be so lame.

4547
04:10:45,950 --> 04:10:47,260
All right.

4548
04:10:47,260 --> 04:10:48,540
Look at how scary I am.

4549
04:10:48,540 --> 04:10:52,989
Sorry.

4550
04:10:52,989 --> 04:10:54,430
I've always acted this wolf.

4551
04:10:54,430 --> 04:10:54,829
Oh my god.

4552
04:10:54,829 --> 04:10:55,870
That feels a lot of damage.

4553
04:10:56,510 --> 04:10:59,059
I have no more healing.

4554
04:10:59,620 --> 04:11:03,020
Hey, we got really cocky.

4555
04:11:06,750 --> 04:11:07,469
Oh shit.

4556
04:11:07,469 --> 04:11:09,069
This is actually kind of bad.

4557
04:11:12,370 --> 04:11:14,049
You have to win or you scammed everyone.

4558
04:11:15,889 --> 04:11:16,930
You have to win.

4559
04:11:17,969 --> 04:11:26,850
I've got some warming stones down.

4560
04:11:35,059 --> 04:11:37,780
At least I can't throw more than that far.

4561
04:11:57,969 --> 04:12:00,049
Why are you doing like Homer Simpson yells?

4562
04:12:02,989 --> 04:12:03,309
Sorry.

4563
04:12:04,270 --> 04:12:13,709
Oh shit.

4564
04:12:21,020 --> 04:12:21,579
Don't do it.

4565
04:12:23,420 --> 04:12:27,500
Sir, it's going to be up to you.

4566
04:12:27,500 --> 04:12:29,100
I'm going to be able to hit him one or two more times.

4567
04:12:29,100 --> 04:12:47,329
You're going to have to for the guild or something for the guild.

4568
04:12:49,329 --> 04:12:51,729
Scam did not happen.

4569
04:12:51,729 --> 04:12:52,450
Scam averted.

4570
04:12:53,649 --> 04:12:56,930
Sword key for the teleporter.

4571
04:12:56,930 --> 04:12:57,729
Oh, nice.

4572
04:12:57,729 --> 04:12:59,680
And some battle bearings.

4573
04:12:59,680 --> 04:13:00,000
All right.

4574
04:13:00,719 --> 04:13:01,979
Let's go smoke a bowl.

4575
04:13:03,739 --> 04:13:04,139
Let's go.

4576
04:13:04,139 --> 04:13:04,620
I can't.

4577
04:13:04,620 --> 04:13:05,739
I can't get on my horse.

4578
04:13:07,020 --> 04:13:07,420
I can't either.

4579
04:13:17,729 --> 04:13:20,770
That could have gone really, really wrong if that was not that dog.

4580
04:13:21,500 --> 04:13:23,260
I think you get you get like canceled.

4581
04:13:25,020 --> 04:13:26,540
I think if we didn't kill that.

4582
04:13:27,420 --> 04:13:29,739
Like scamming everybody out of channel.

4583
04:13:31,340 --> 04:13:32,620
I don't think you recover from that.

4584
04:13:47,899 --> 04:13:49,379
All right.

4585
04:13:49,379 --> 04:13:50,819
So we're going to burn the tree.

4586
04:13:51,540 --> 04:13:54,579
I'm going to go take a pee break because I didn't go when you did.

4587
04:13:54,579 --> 04:13:57,889
I'm going to get I'm going to refill my little drink here.

4588
04:13:57,889 --> 04:13:59,729
And I'm going to do like a grab a snack.

4589
04:14:00,209 --> 04:14:01,010
Okay.

4590
04:14:01,010 --> 04:14:01,809
As well.

4591
04:14:01,809 --> 04:14:09,700
And then we can assess what we want to do because we've got our Missoula.

4592
04:14:12,590 --> 04:14:14,590
Did you walk into the bowl when you played?

4593
04:14:14,590 --> 04:14:16,030
You just you just walk into the center.

4594
04:14:16,590 --> 04:14:17,149
I don't remember.

4595
04:14:17,149 --> 04:14:17,950
No, I don't think so.

4596
04:14:18,750 --> 04:14:24,500
I did because it doesn't even look that far down.

4597
04:14:25,579 --> 04:14:27,659
And there's like a thing in the middle.

4598
04:14:27,659 --> 04:14:28,620
I fell.

4599
04:14:28,620 --> 04:14:29,579
I just walked straight in.

4600
04:14:31,180 --> 04:14:31,819
Maybe I did.

4601
04:14:33,540 --> 04:14:33,940
You did.

4602
04:14:33,940 --> 04:14:37,059
I think I remember you saying to me that you also did it back.

4603
04:14:37,059 --> 04:14:37,700
I probably did.

4604
04:14:38,340 --> 04:14:39,149
All right.

4605
04:14:39,549 --> 04:14:42,670
You should probably just do this because I'm imagining your host.

4606
04:14:42,670 --> 04:14:43,309
You should just do it.

4607
04:14:43,950 --> 04:14:44,909
Yeah.

4608
04:14:44,909 --> 04:14:46,989
I mean, like I am the chosen one.

4609
04:14:46,989 --> 04:14:49,790
So I don't mean to like be that guy.

4610
04:14:49,790 --> 04:14:50,989
But what do I do?

4611
04:14:53,309 --> 04:14:55,069
You say, yes, I'd like to burn the tree.

4612
04:14:56,979 --> 04:14:59,860
She won't talk to me.

4613
04:14:59,860 --> 04:15:02,979
I think as you sat down first, you like took her.

4614
04:15:02,979 --> 04:15:04,770
You won't talk to me either.

4615
04:15:04,770 --> 04:15:07,940
I think there is an item we need.

4616
04:15:07,940 --> 04:15:12,239
I was saying earlier, I think there's like a burn the bush kind of like joint.

4617
04:15:12,239 --> 04:15:14,979
We have to do something.

4618
04:15:14,979 --> 04:15:16,020
I think we have to do it solo.

4619
04:15:19,200 --> 04:15:19,440
Okay.

4620
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:19,760
Yeah.

4621
04:15:19,760 --> 04:15:20,399
Just kick me out.

4622
04:15:21,139 --> 04:15:21,860
Kick me out.

4623
04:15:21,860 --> 04:15:25,680
Go do some actually wait before you kick me out.

4624
04:15:25,680 --> 04:15:26,879
I'm going to give you a couple of things.

4625
04:15:28,079 --> 04:15:32,500
And I would appreciate it in this time when we're going to bathroom, coming back.

4626
04:15:32,500 --> 04:15:39,629
I appreciate if you take all these stones, please shove them up my ass like a baseball.

4627
04:15:40,670 --> 04:15:41,950
I would say you probably shouldn't do that.

4628
04:15:41,950 --> 04:15:45,329
But I don't know how many you need.

4629
04:15:45,329 --> 04:15:46,049
You would need.

4630
04:15:46,049 --> 04:15:48,290
So how many plus sevens do you need?

4631
04:15:48,290 --> 04:15:49,090
Three.

4632
04:15:49,090 --> 04:15:52,209
Just give them all to me, man.

4633
04:15:52,209 --> 04:15:53,010
I don't know.

4634
04:15:53,010 --> 04:15:54,770
And then I have a couple of plus eights.

4635
04:15:54,770 --> 04:15:58,100
Here you go.

4636
04:15:58,100 --> 04:16:05,840
So then I would appreciate it if you were to take these and go upgrade the absolute

4637
04:16:05,840 --> 04:16:06,639
hell out of them.

4638
04:16:06,639 --> 04:16:10,139
I would really appreciate it.

4639
04:16:10,139 --> 04:16:14,610
That's a lot.

4640
04:16:14,610 --> 04:16:15,649
That's a lot of stones.

4641
04:16:17,489 --> 04:16:19,969
Dude, if you guys thought we were pumping that damage,

4642
04:16:19,969 --> 04:16:22,290
wait until you see us when we come back from the short break.

4643
04:16:23,569 --> 04:16:25,090
See you when we come back from the break.

4644
04:16:25,090 --> 04:16:31,059
See you in a minute.

4645
04:16:36,399 --> 04:21:06,860
Hello.

4646
04:21:06,860 --> 04:21:16,930
Hey, I got some super crunchy pretzels.

4647
04:21:16,930 --> 04:21:18,510
I made some naan bread.

4648
04:21:18,510 --> 04:21:22,299
And apparently I like let the cut scene play for burning it.

4649
04:21:23,180 --> 04:21:28,540
And I put music on and my chat saying it was like an AMV and everything fits so perfectly.

4650
04:21:28,540 --> 04:21:31,180
Like scene changes had song changes.

4651
04:21:38,350 --> 04:21:39,389
They're like so baffled.

4652
04:21:39,389 --> 04:21:40,750
They want me to go back and watch it.

4653
04:21:42,139 --> 04:21:43,260
I might be in some trouble here.

4654
04:21:44,940 --> 04:21:45,899
No, no, no, I'm all right.

4655
04:21:47,340 --> 04:21:48,459
I thought I had mine.

4656
04:21:48,459 --> 04:21:49,739
Oh, the IRS doesn't know yet.

4657
04:21:55,100 --> 04:21:56,940
You're crunching right in your mic, man.

4658
04:21:56,940 --> 04:21:57,739
No, I am.

4659
04:21:58,299 --> 04:21:59,659
I'm like pretty far back.

4660
04:22:00,219 --> 04:22:02,450
It's pretty loud.

4661
04:22:02,450 --> 04:22:03,250
Is it loud?

4662
04:22:03,250 --> 04:22:06,370
I'm like, dude, can you hear how far away I am?

4663
04:22:08,540 --> 04:22:12,059
You sound a little echoey, but it is like you're crunching right in the mic.

4664
04:22:12,059 --> 04:22:12,299
What?

4665
04:22:16,059 --> 04:22:17,899
I am like across the room.

4666
04:22:17,899 --> 04:22:32,020
I have long observed the lands between.

4667
04:22:32,739 --> 04:22:34,819
This world is in undead.

4668
04:22:36,260 --> 04:22:37,780
You're a bad boy.

4669
04:22:37,780 --> 04:22:39,780
You've been a bad, bad boy.

4670
04:22:40,819 --> 04:22:44,739
I'm just sitting back watching Elden Ring and just like crunching on something.

4671
04:22:45,379 --> 04:22:51,760
Oh, I was supposed to go upgrade your weapons.

4672
04:22:52,319 --> 04:22:53,680
Yeah, you're supposed to do that.

4673
04:22:55,920 --> 04:23:02,420
Well, I'm in Faramundana and I got to get a bonfire.

4674
04:23:02,420 --> 04:23:02,899
I was.

4675
04:23:03,629 --> 04:23:04,530
Hold on.

4676
04:23:04,530 --> 04:23:06,290
I would I would say you should go do it, too.

4677
04:23:06,290 --> 04:23:08,670
But like I have your weapons.

4678
04:23:08,670 --> 04:23:11,389
Yeah, go do that and then go go to Armazilla.

4679
04:23:34,909 --> 04:23:35,149
What?

4680
04:23:35,149 --> 04:23:35,709
Stop doing it.

4681
04:23:35,709 --> 04:23:36,270
I got hit.

4682
04:23:36,270 --> 04:23:37,950
That was that was a hit noise.

4683
04:23:37,950 --> 04:23:39,790
That was me reacting to getting hit.

4684
04:23:41,280 --> 04:23:41,920
Wait, what happened?

4685
04:23:42,719 --> 04:23:43,280
Huh?

4686
04:23:43,280 --> 04:23:46,319
Oh, I was I'm just I'm just eating.

4687
04:23:46,959 --> 04:23:50,239
I I there is an earthquake in my head right now when I chew.

4688
04:23:50,239 --> 04:23:51,440
I can't hear anything you're saying.

4689
04:24:04,290 --> 04:24:05,170
Is it really that bad?

4690
04:24:19,010 --> 04:24:22,850
It sounds like you're eating like a human hand with how many bones are crunching.

4691
04:24:24,959 --> 04:24:27,629
Like, dude, this is awful.

4692
04:24:27,629 --> 04:24:28,350
Oh, my God.

4693
04:24:42,879 --> 04:24:44,479
Drywall tastes a little different today.

4694
04:24:55,520 --> 04:24:57,280
It might be about it might be about that time.

4695
04:24:58,500 --> 04:25:02,860
It might be about that time.

4696
04:25:03,579 --> 04:25:04,639
Sample it.

4697
04:25:04,639 --> 04:25:28,319
Let me change your channel to like mukbang.

4698
04:25:29,120 --> 04:26:06,340
Ready or awfully quiet.

4699
04:26:06,340 --> 04:26:07,219
I don't.

4700
04:26:07,219 --> 04:26:08,100
Delicious.

4701
04:26:13,459 --> 04:26:13,780
What?

4702
04:26:15,280 --> 04:26:16,000
What?

4703
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:20,020
I don't know, man.

4704
04:26:20,020 --> 04:26:21,540
I don't know what you're doing.

4705
04:26:21,540 --> 04:26:22,500
I don't know what you're on about.

4706
04:26:25,120 --> 04:26:28,030
OK, I want another one.

4707
04:26:28,030 --> 04:26:28,510
So bad.

4708
04:26:28,510 --> 04:26:28,750
All right.

4709
04:26:30,379 --> 04:26:31,819
I am at Armazilla.

4710
04:26:31,819 --> 04:26:33,819
I'm imagining we should get the first bonfire.

4711
04:26:33,899 --> 04:26:37,659
Get the first bonfire and I got both of your swords to plus 25, dude.

4712
04:26:41,629 --> 04:26:42,510
You know what that means?

4713
04:26:42,510 --> 04:26:43,469
I didn't even want that item.

4714
04:26:46,819 --> 04:26:50,290
That means we have to go fight Melania.

4715
04:26:50,290 --> 04:26:50,930
Say it.

4716
04:26:50,930 --> 04:26:52,370
I know that's what you want to say.

4717
04:26:52,370 --> 04:26:54,930
That means we have to go fight Melania.

4718
04:26:54,930 --> 04:26:56,209
Where even is the first bonfire?

4719
04:26:58,049 --> 04:27:00,450
You got to go past the first group of enemies and it's on the left.

4720
04:27:18,139 --> 04:27:19,899
What the fuck was that?

4721
04:27:20,540 --> 04:27:21,180
Why did I go?

4722
04:27:23,889 --> 04:27:25,090
I'm holding forward.

4723
04:27:25,090 --> 04:27:27,170
Why did I go back dodge?

4724
04:27:27,170 --> 04:27:27,489
What?

4725
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:33,760
I'm holding forward and going like this.

4726
04:27:33,760 --> 04:27:34,959
Why did he go like this?

4727
04:27:35,520 --> 04:27:41,739
That's very cringe streamer.

4728
04:27:42,540 --> 04:27:42,940
It was.

4729
04:27:42,940 --> 04:27:43,659
That was annoying.

4730
04:27:45,569 --> 04:27:49,760
OK, I'm ready.

4731
04:27:49,760 --> 04:27:52,000
So you want let's go fight Melania.

4732
04:27:52,000 --> 04:27:56,719
Go beat Melania first try because we have an insane amount of abilities now.

4733
04:27:57,280 --> 04:27:59,680
We have a ton of health.

4734
04:28:00,319 --> 04:28:01,389
Should be able to.

4735
04:28:02,190 --> 04:28:04,190
Any damage we can probably mitigate it pretty well.

4736
04:28:05,549 --> 04:28:06,750
I feel you.

4737
04:28:07,549 --> 04:28:11,170
Would you date phase one Melania or phase two?

4738
04:28:13,700 --> 04:28:14,979
I hate this character.

4739
04:28:15,940 --> 04:28:16,340
Sorry.

4740
04:28:17,459 --> 04:28:31,659
OK, we're actually going to go fighter.

4741
04:28:31,659 --> 04:28:34,620
OK, I'm ready to join your game.

4742
04:28:35,340 --> 04:28:45,659
I forget what waypoint it is now because we can do the other the easier shortcut.

4743
04:28:47,020 --> 04:28:50,500
You overclock your gaming system.

4744
04:28:50,500 --> 04:28:51,219
I did not.

4745
04:28:51,940 --> 04:28:53,379
My room is hot enough already.

4746
04:28:54,020 --> 04:28:56,270
I'm opening my world to wanderers.

4747
04:28:56,909 --> 04:28:57,709
Thank you.

4748
04:28:57,709 --> 04:29:09,340
Going to get the rot.

4749
04:29:10,059 --> 04:29:14,909
If you date Melania, you get the rot.

4750
04:29:16,670 --> 04:29:18,049
All right, give me my weapons.

4751
04:29:18,049 --> 04:29:24,129
I threw them in the fucking volcano.

4752
04:29:25,540 --> 04:29:26,180
You're out.

4753
04:29:26,180 --> 04:29:26,659
You're out.

4754
04:29:26,659 --> 04:29:27,860
And I win.

4755
04:29:27,860 --> 04:29:28,819
They would.

4756
04:29:28,819 --> 04:29:29,860
The ref would call the match.

4757
04:29:30,579 --> 04:29:31,540
The ref would call the match.

4758
04:29:32,100 --> 04:29:38,940
Oh, yeah.

4759
04:29:38,940 --> 04:29:40,420
Oh, yeah.

4760
04:29:40,420 --> 04:29:42,930
Let's see.

4761
04:29:43,329 --> 04:29:43,889
Oh, yeah.

4762
04:29:44,850 --> 04:29:50,850
Re 21 301.

4763
04:29:50,850 --> 04:29:54,370
Make sure you put some preserving blouses on your hot bar.

4764
04:29:57,149 --> 04:29:57,870
You're going to need them.

4765
04:29:58,909 --> 04:30:03,870
Look at these.

4766
04:30:05,819 --> 04:30:06,059
All right.

4767
04:30:06,059 --> 04:30:06,860
Let me do this real quick.

4768
04:30:08,399 --> 04:30:12,930
Oh, I'm just going to dump strength.

4769
04:30:12,930 --> 04:30:15,899
Need a little bit more.

4770
04:30:22,020 --> 04:30:23,819
Oh, you get away from me.

4771
04:30:23,819 --> 04:30:24,620
What are you doing that for?

4772
04:30:25,500 --> 04:30:25,739
Okay.

4773
04:30:28,030 --> 04:30:29,549
He's becoming stronger.

4774
04:30:30,510 --> 04:30:34,190
I now am so unbelievably strong.

4775
04:30:34,190 --> 04:30:34,670
Are you ready?

4776
04:30:35,229 --> 04:30:35,790
Yeah.

4777
04:30:35,790 --> 04:30:37,950
Let's go beat Melania.

4778
04:30:49,200 --> 04:30:51,280
If we lose, it's because you killed that musician.

4779
04:30:51,920 --> 04:30:59,469
To be clear.

4780
04:30:59,469 --> 04:31:00,190
Let us bet.

4781
04:31:00,190 --> 04:31:00,670
Let them bet.

4782
04:31:02,430 --> 04:31:02,989
And how many?

4783
04:31:05,760 --> 04:31:06,479
I don't know.

4784
04:31:06,479 --> 04:31:07,200
Five.

4785
04:31:07,200 --> 04:31:08,340
Five attempts or ten?

4786
04:31:10,450 --> 04:31:11,170
In three.

4787
04:31:11,170 --> 04:31:12,290
I think we got it in three.

4788
04:31:12,290 --> 04:31:13,809
Oh, I don't know if I bet on that.

4789
04:31:15,020 --> 04:31:17,739
Well, you're going to get killed by the water foul thing.

4790
04:31:18,459 --> 04:31:20,139
You're going to get killed by the water dance thing.

4791
04:31:20,940 --> 04:31:21,899
No, shut up.

4792
04:31:21,899 --> 04:31:22,620
And then you're going to go.

4793
04:31:22,620 --> 04:31:23,739
No, no, no.

4794
04:31:23,739 --> 04:31:24,780
We're going to have to restart.

4795
04:31:24,780 --> 04:31:25,100
Okay.

4796
04:31:25,100 --> 04:31:26,459
That's going to be you in a second.

4797
04:31:26,459 --> 04:31:27,340
You're going to get killed.

4798
04:31:27,340 --> 04:31:27,739
No, it's not.

4799
04:31:27,739 --> 04:31:29,020
You're the you're bad.

4800
04:31:29,020 --> 04:31:29,819
You're bad.

4801
04:31:29,819 --> 04:31:31,020
I forgot to upgrade my moon veil.

4802
04:31:31,020 --> 04:31:31,340
Fuck.

4803
04:31:32,059 --> 04:31:34,559
See, it's already an issue.

4804
04:31:34,559 --> 04:31:39,389
Well, I was upgrading your things and I got distracted.

4805
04:31:39,389 --> 04:31:44,340
I'm probably not even going to use it.

4806
04:31:44,340 --> 04:31:44,579
Okay.

4807
04:31:44,579 --> 04:31:46,100
Let's go upgrade moon veil.

4808
04:31:47,059 --> 04:31:56,370
I it's going to do the thing again where it's not going to lose.

4809
04:31:58,370 --> 04:32:01,409
They're so overleveled, but everything scales.

4810
04:32:02,219 --> 04:32:08,100
If we lose to her, then we have to do a full playthrough in Genshin Impact.

4811
04:32:09,600 --> 04:32:11,280
No, no, dude.

4812
04:32:11,280 --> 04:32:11,840
I'm not.

4813
04:32:11,840 --> 04:32:13,040
I don't want to agree to that.

4814
04:32:14,639 --> 04:32:17,120
That's just like I have nothing against that game.

4815
04:32:17,120 --> 04:32:17,680
I just don't.

4816
04:32:17,680 --> 04:32:18,479
We lose to her.

4817
04:32:18,479 --> 04:32:21,040
Then we have to get to like Masters and League of Legends.

4818
04:32:21,040 --> 04:32:24,000
What is what is that's going to take years?

4819
04:32:24,000 --> 04:32:25,040
That's going to take months.

4820
04:32:25,600 --> 04:32:34,450
I'm sorry.

4821
04:32:34,450 --> 04:32:35,809
I just love this joke.

4822
04:32:35,809 --> 04:32:37,010
I don't want to play either of them.

4823
04:32:37,010 --> 04:32:38,209
I don't I don't either.

4824
04:32:38,209 --> 04:32:39,569
Like I've not again.

4825
04:32:39,569 --> 04:32:42,209
Should impact is probably pretty fun.

4826
04:32:42,209 --> 04:32:42,850
I don't know.

4827
04:32:42,850 --> 04:32:49,729
I don't want to play it for like the next six months.

4828
04:32:49,729 --> 04:32:53,170
We both have to eat an Arby's euro if we lose.

4829
04:32:56,370 --> 04:32:57,329
My moon does plus 10.

4830
04:32:57,329 --> 04:32:57,809
Let's go back.

4831
04:32:58,370 --> 04:33:00,049
What the fuck are you doing?

4832
04:33:04,319 --> 04:33:05,680
Wait, that's weird.

4833
04:33:05,680 --> 04:33:07,279
I don't I don't know who upgraded that.

4834
04:33:07,279 --> 04:33:09,840
I didn't because I wouldn't want to like upgrade a moon veil.

4835
04:33:09,840 --> 04:33:18,029
What it's doing that thing again.

4836
04:33:20,529 --> 04:33:22,209
If we don't we don't do it in 10 tries.

4837
04:33:22,209 --> 04:33:24,930
We have to both eat an Arby's euro.

4838
04:33:24,930 --> 04:33:27,169
I honestly think we'll get it in like three.

4839
04:33:27,169 --> 04:33:31,330
You're underestimating how incredibly.

4840
04:33:31,330 --> 04:33:34,369
I'm just trying to get like believers to give the doubters money.

4841
04:33:34,369 --> 04:33:38,380
Yeah, I don't know if it already passed.

4842
04:33:38,380 --> 04:33:49,790
Okay, German beat this game.

4843
04:33:49,790 --> 04:33:50,909
I beat this game.

4844
04:33:50,909 --> 04:33:52,189
I'm an accomplished gamer.

4845
04:33:52,189 --> 04:33:54,669
I shit my pants to win a quick play game in Overwatch.

4846
04:33:54,669 --> 04:33:57,950
Like I'm a born again gamer.

4847
04:33:57,950 --> 04:33:59,869
Be careful how many times you say that though,

4848
04:33:59,869 --> 04:34:01,389
because I feel like that's like your legacy.

4849
04:34:01,389 --> 04:34:04,909
If you continue to say that it is that's that.

4850
04:34:04,909 --> 04:34:10,189
That turns into legacy if that's continued to be kind of spoken of.

4851
04:34:10,189 --> 04:34:10,750
I don't know.

4852
04:34:10,750 --> 04:34:11,229
It's fine.

4853
04:34:11,229 --> 04:34:14,270
It's it's in my I think it's in my channel information.

4854
04:34:15,889 --> 04:34:16,529
Is it really?

4855
04:34:17,090 --> 04:34:17,650
It might be.

4856
04:34:17,650 --> 04:34:18,369
I'd have to double check.

4857
04:34:18,369 --> 04:34:20,209
That's actually really funny.

4858
04:34:21,779 --> 04:34:25,139
I'm actually kind of envious that you shit your pants and put it in your bio

4859
04:34:25,139 --> 04:34:28,580
because that's I feel like that's actually really funny.

4860
04:34:28,580 --> 04:34:30,509
It's the kind of guy I am.

4861
04:34:30,509 --> 04:34:31,150
I'll do it.

4862
04:34:31,150 --> 04:34:32,669
All right, let's let's go.

4863
04:34:36,110 --> 04:35:18,060
Let's do it when when when I'm stuck.

4864
04:35:19,599 --> 04:35:19,840
It's fine.

4865
04:35:19,840 --> 04:35:20,639
She's on me.

4866
04:35:20,639 --> 04:35:22,959
And yeah, I just have I have too much health.

4867
04:35:22,959 --> 04:35:23,759
She can't touch me.

4868
04:35:24,479 --> 04:35:31,490
I'm untouchable.

4869
04:35:40,979 --> 04:36:10,099
Oh, run.

4870
04:36:10,099 --> 04:36:13,779
It's coming to you.

4871
04:36:13,779 --> 04:37:20,529
It's coming to you.

4872
04:37:20,529 --> 04:37:22,029
Dodged.

4873
04:37:22,029 --> 04:37:23,630
You are nothing to me, Blania.

4874
04:37:28,819 --> 04:37:32,500
Oh, get pillared.

4875
04:37:33,220 --> 04:37:33,779
Dumb shit.

4876
04:37:45,860 --> 04:37:46,900
Oh, she's busted.

4877
04:37:46,900 --> 04:37:47,860
She's busted.

4878
04:37:47,860 --> 04:37:49,139
What the fuck just happened in my game?

4879
04:37:49,700 --> 04:37:51,540
I don't I was waiting for you to hit her.

4880
04:37:58,130 --> 04:38:00,590
I told I told you, dude.

4881
04:38:02,290 --> 04:38:03,810
I got fucking told you.

4882
04:38:04,049 --> 04:38:06,209
I got Morgoth's great run.

4883
04:38:06,209 --> 04:38:06,709
Same.

4884
04:38:12,290 --> 04:38:13,490
You didn't believe in three.

4885
04:38:13,490 --> 04:38:16,290
We were just so fucking weak is the same thing as Placidusix.

4886
04:38:16,770 --> 04:38:20,049
I should not have been fighting her yet.

4887
04:38:21,409 --> 04:38:22,529
Yeah, I mean.

4888
04:38:27,709 --> 04:38:28,959
Fuck.

4889
04:38:31,939 --> 04:38:32,340
Nice.

4890
04:38:32,340 --> 04:38:34,979
You earned a moment from German 985.

4891
04:38:34,979 --> 04:38:35,700
Time to claim.

4892
04:38:36,700 --> 04:38:37,099
Yeah, dude.

4893
04:38:37,099 --> 04:38:45,099
I'm sorry, like being so fucked up, but you want to, you know, roaming up one time.

4894
04:38:45,099 --> 04:38:45,599
What?

4895
04:38:47,810 --> 04:38:48,770
I'm celibate, dude.

4896
04:38:49,330 --> 04:38:50,369
Let me just say something real quick.

4897
04:38:51,759 --> 04:38:55,360
Yeah, if you want to do that, I guess that sounds like fun.

4898
04:38:55,360 --> 04:39:01,389
But just maybe don't talk so much shit next time.

4899
04:39:01,389 --> 04:39:02,029
Who are you?

4900
04:39:02,029 --> 04:39:03,069
Who are you talking to?

4901
04:39:16,540 --> 04:39:18,779
Melania was fucking calling me.

4902
04:39:18,779 --> 04:39:27,740
What?

4903
04:39:27,740 --> 04:39:31,740
My chat asks and I ask, is Jerma's brand weed now?

4904
04:39:33,380 --> 04:39:39,060
Only for this one jokey dumb thing where like we're rolling blunts with Placidusix and shit.

4905
04:39:39,060 --> 04:39:41,060
Like, like just for like the last couple of days.

4906
04:39:42,099 --> 04:39:44,029
I don't know.

4907
04:39:44,029 --> 04:39:44,669
You've changed.

4908
04:39:51,700 --> 04:39:52,580
Wait, did you miss the point?

4909
04:39:52,580 --> 04:39:56,020
Did you miss the fact that that was Melania calling me being like, hey, let's like,

4910
04:39:56,020 --> 04:40:01,139
let's like fucking squash the beef and like, I missed a lot of something

4911
04:40:01,139 --> 04:40:03,619
because it looked like you were like praying at the altar.

4912
04:40:03,619 --> 04:40:06,099
Like you walked up to the altar and you just started talking to yourself.

4913
04:40:06,099 --> 04:40:07,459
Like you could hear God's voice.

4914
04:40:10,500 --> 04:40:11,619
You guys don't get it.

4915
04:40:19,090 --> 04:40:21,090
Jerma has reefer madness.

4916
04:40:21,810 --> 04:40:24,659
We're worried about you.

4917
04:40:24,659 --> 04:40:26,020
Are we are we ready?

4918
04:40:26,020 --> 04:40:26,340
Yes.

4919
04:40:26,340 --> 04:40:29,020
Go kill right card.

4920
04:40:29,020 --> 04:40:30,380
I think it's going to be a radon.

4921
04:40:30,700 --> 04:40:32,939
You think it's going to be a putrid slob.

4922
04:40:33,819 --> 04:40:35,979
I think we have not seen a putrid slob in a while.

4923
04:40:44,500 --> 04:40:45,700
Putrid slob.

4924
04:40:46,580 --> 04:40:49,419
Did you end up making a character in the myriad?

4925
04:40:49,419 --> 04:40:49,900
Yeah.

4926
04:40:49,900 --> 04:40:51,099
I mean like the revolting.

4927
04:40:51,099 --> 04:40:51,419
What was it?

4928
04:40:51,419 --> 04:40:53,740
Like the putrid disgusting slob or something.

4929
04:40:55,169 --> 04:40:56,130
Oh my God.

4930
04:40:56,130 --> 04:40:56,610
I didn't.

4931
04:40:56,610 --> 04:40:58,849
The great putrid slob, I think is all it is.

4932
04:41:02,220 --> 04:41:04,139
He was charging that up.

4933
04:41:04,139 --> 04:41:06,139
He so badly wanted to do that move to us.

4934
04:41:10,020 --> 04:41:11,540
He's just like, I'm.

4935
04:41:14,029 --> 04:41:14,909
Bro, come on.

4936
04:41:19,569 --> 04:41:20,849
I'm inside of the bear.

4937
04:41:25,409 --> 04:41:26,049
Millennia.

4938
04:41:26,049 --> 04:41:26,689
I sleep.

4939
04:41:26,689 --> 04:41:27,409
Giant bear.

4940
04:41:28,290 --> 04:41:29,490
I awaken for the meme.

4941
04:41:30,130 --> 04:41:33,470
This guy shooting crossbows.

4942
04:41:34,369 --> 04:41:35,090
There's a dog.

4943
04:41:35,889 --> 04:41:38,849
Do you remember when these dogs would like multi hit you like 16 times

4944
04:41:38,849 --> 04:41:39,810
and you'd instantly die?

4945
04:41:41,439 --> 04:41:41,840
You're dead.

4946
04:41:42,659 --> 04:41:44,180
I got knocked off by the bear.

4947
04:41:45,459 --> 04:41:47,299
I'm relating to that content right now.

4948
04:41:53,060 --> 04:41:54,419
I'm not going to even reset it.

4949
04:41:54,419 --> 04:41:55,939
I'm just going to come over to where you are.

4950
04:41:57,250 --> 04:41:58,290
I have one of those things.

4951
04:42:16,830 --> 04:42:17,470
Did you kill a bear?

4952
04:42:18,560 --> 04:42:19,279
Now?

4953
04:42:19,279 --> 04:42:20,080
No, help.

4954
04:42:21,360 --> 04:42:22,000
I died.

4955
04:42:22,000 --> 04:42:22,639
It's scary.

4956
04:42:22,639 --> 04:42:23,759
It's scary.

4957
04:42:33,389 --> 04:42:34,830
He's just roaring at you.

4958
04:42:41,180 --> 04:42:42,139
Nice kill.

4959
04:42:42,139 --> 04:42:43,099
You're welcome.

4960
04:42:43,099 --> 04:42:47,259
Yeah, we're going to put that head up above my fireplace.

4961
04:42:49,380 --> 04:42:50,020
Ooh.

4962
04:42:50,020 --> 04:42:51,740
Okay.

4963
04:42:51,740 --> 04:42:52,700
Let everyone know.

4964
04:42:54,060 --> 04:43:11,169
Rycon.

4965
04:43:11,169 --> 04:43:13,889
I hope whoever it is, they still get the voice lines.

4966
04:43:13,889 --> 04:43:17,009
Like how Margaret was saying shit earlier.

4967
04:43:17,009 --> 04:43:18,529
I would have imagined that's the case.

4968
04:43:19,490 --> 04:43:26,900
Wait, did you ask me what's like your top favorite thing

4969
04:43:26,900 --> 04:43:28,099
you would ever want to do or something?

4970
04:43:29,459 --> 04:43:32,020
What was at some point where you were like,

4971
04:43:32,020 --> 04:43:34,099
hey, what's like the number one thing you want to do?

4972
04:43:34,819 --> 04:43:35,779
Want to do.

4973
04:43:35,779 --> 04:43:36,900
Like just like in general.

4974
04:43:37,619 --> 04:43:40,020
I've never asked that, but sure you can continue.

4975
04:43:40,020 --> 04:43:40,340
Okay.

4976
04:43:41,360 --> 04:43:44,479
You know those lava places where you get like,

4977
04:43:44,479 --> 04:43:47,759
you can take like the poker and like poke the gooey lava

4978
04:43:47,759 --> 04:43:50,080
and it kind of just get places in the world.

4979
04:43:51,729 --> 04:43:53,409
I want to go there.

4980
04:43:54,049 --> 04:43:54,610
Eventually.

4981
04:43:55,250 --> 04:43:58,189
You want to poke if you could do anything,

4982
04:43:58,189 --> 04:43:59,549
you want to poke lava.

4983
04:43:59,549 --> 04:44:01,630
I think like going to one of those lava sites,

4984
04:44:01,630 --> 04:44:02,189
whatever they are.

4985
04:44:02,909 --> 04:44:04,290
And they're called volcanoes.

4986
04:44:04,849 --> 04:44:07,409
Yeah, but like there's a safe specific place

4987
04:44:07,409 --> 04:44:10,369
where there's some kind of running down like kind of like this

4988
04:44:10,369 --> 04:44:12,930
and you can kind of just go look at it and like poke it and stuff.

4989
04:44:15,299 --> 04:44:15,619
Okay.

4990
04:44:16,830 --> 04:44:19,389
Don't act like don't act like half of you

4991
04:44:19,389 --> 04:44:21,310
didn't have not watched the YouTube videos

4992
04:44:21,310 --> 04:44:22,270
where people doing that.

4993
04:44:22,270 --> 04:44:23,229
It's like, whoa, cool.

4994
04:44:23,229 --> 04:44:25,150
It's like scientific and don't bat-chest it.

4995
04:44:25,150 --> 04:44:26,270
I will fucking end my stream.

4996
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:32,720
Don't hurt this guy.

4997
04:44:36,990 --> 04:44:39,389
He just grown like that hurt him to do that.

4998
04:44:42,819 --> 04:44:43,779
Oh, I see.

4999
04:44:43,779 --> 04:44:44,659
You're picking on him.

5000
04:44:47,169 --> 04:44:49,279
That sucked.

5001
04:44:53,310 --> 04:44:53,790
Awful.

5002
04:44:54,430 --> 04:44:55,549
And yet he persists.

5003
04:44:58,240 --> 04:44:59,119
Play something else.

5004
04:45:03,250 --> 04:45:04,209
Not very good.

5005
04:45:07,919 --> 04:45:08,720
Holy shit.

5006
04:45:09,360 --> 04:45:10,580
He gets to live.

5007
04:45:29,729 --> 04:45:31,009
I don't want to talk about it either.

5008
04:45:31,009 --> 04:45:33,380
I'm I'm a math.

5009
04:45:33,380 --> 04:45:35,619
So you instantly kill the jar enemies,

5010
04:45:35,619 --> 04:45:37,700
but you'll leave the horn guy alone.

5011
04:45:39,340 --> 04:45:40,619
What you like the jar.

5012
04:45:40,619 --> 04:45:41,900
I didn't I didn't know that was it.

5013
04:45:41,900 --> 04:45:43,659
You never said like do not kill the jar.

5014
04:45:44,860 --> 04:45:45,659
Didn't need to be said.

5015
04:45:45,659 --> 04:45:46,220
Oh, okay.

5016
04:45:46,220 --> 04:45:47,099
Don't kill the rat.

5017
04:45:47,099 --> 04:45:51,200
You you kill your rat with a little rabies

5018
04:45:51,200 --> 04:45:53,439
and it has like a puss on it.

5019
04:45:54,159 --> 04:45:55,979
Sure.

5020
04:45:55,979 --> 04:45:56,939
Can you do this in real life?

5021
04:45:58,110 --> 04:45:58,349
What?

5022
04:45:59,650 --> 04:46:00,049
You know.

5023
04:46:01,330 --> 04:46:05,970
Can I fight a bear in real life?

5024
04:46:06,049 --> 04:46:07,729
He's not even a fan of Elden Ring.

5025
04:46:08,450 --> 04:46:14,750
What?

5026
04:46:16,779 --> 04:46:18,860
Dude, go go poke some lava, dude.

5027
04:46:19,500 --> 04:46:21,419
Don't act like that wouldn't be fun, please.

5028
04:46:22,880 --> 04:46:25,680
I think it'd be more fun to roast marshmallows over it.

5029
04:46:25,680 --> 04:46:27,759
It'd be fun just to kind of just do it is

5030
04:46:27,759 --> 04:46:29,680
I think just be like experience like a like oh,

5031
04:46:32,139 --> 04:46:33,419
oh my god, that was brutal.

5032
04:46:34,299 --> 04:46:36,220
That woman in a wheelchair.

5033
04:46:37,900 --> 04:46:38,139
What?

5034
04:46:39,819 --> 04:46:40,779
She can't walk.

5035
04:46:41,580 --> 04:46:42,939
Wait, she was in a wheelchair.

5036
04:46:43,900 --> 04:46:44,540
She should be.

5037
04:46:45,819 --> 04:46:46,700
But I was like, what do you do?

5038
04:46:46,700 --> 04:46:48,700
This isn't like Troll Knight sword.

5039
04:46:49,659 --> 04:46:57,939
Bro, you are fucked.

5040
04:46:59,950 --> 04:47:00,270
All right.

5041
04:47:00,830 --> 04:47:01,709
We're almost there.

5042
04:47:06,180 --> 04:47:07,540
I have low healing.

5043
04:47:07,540 --> 04:47:10,419
If this is a tough enemy and you're poised up.

5044
04:47:10,979 --> 04:47:11,540
Leave quick.

5045
04:47:13,220 --> 04:47:14,180
Jesus Christ.

5046
04:47:14,900 --> 04:47:15,619
I think you died.

5047
04:47:15,619 --> 04:47:16,099
I died.

5048
04:47:17,700 --> 04:47:20,500
My screen faded to black and then it pulled me back

5049
04:47:20,500 --> 04:47:22,659
and I was like, nah, dude, you're actually dead.

5050
04:47:23,650 --> 04:47:24,369
I have the grace.

5051
04:47:24,369 --> 04:47:25,169
I don't know if that matters.

5052
04:47:26,880 --> 04:47:32,430
I think we can warp to it.

5053
04:47:32,430 --> 04:47:36,369
Dude, I had 700,000 souls on me a lot.

5054
04:47:37,259 --> 04:47:45,330
Can you start a vote and you do it?

5055
04:47:50,290 --> 04:47:50,689
Yep.

5056
04:47:50,689 --> 04:47:52,659
Yeah.

5057
04:47:52,659 --> 04:47:53,619
Don't skip the cut scene.

5058
04:47:53,619 --> 04:47:54,020
We won't.

5059
04:47:57,330 --> 04:48:01,740
We start has been wanting to hear this guy talk for the last four streams.

5060
04:48:01,740 --> 04:48:03,419
I love this guy.

5061
04:48:03,419 --> 04:48:09,840
Is it going to be convenient if the rapture happens soon

5062
04:48:09,840 --> 04:48:12,319
and then you can get a volcano in Las Vegas

5063
04:48:12,319 --> 04:48:13,680
and then you could just do it there?

5064
04:48:13,680 --> 04:48:17,069
Why does the rapture have to happen?

5065
04:48:19,119 --> 04:48:19,680
All right.

5066
04:48:19,680 --> 04:48:20,479
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

5067
04:48:21,119 --> 04:48:21,759
They need to vote.

5068
04:48:22,900 --> 04:48:27,470
Oh, I'm just saying, would it be easier to wait for the rapture?

5069
04:48:29,279 --> 04:48:31,439
It would be easier just to take a vacation

5070
04:48:32,509 --> 04:48:37,709
than wait for humanity to end, I think, as the question you're asking.

5071
04:48:37,709 --> 04:48:43,340
Are you going to go on this vacation in the next year?

5072
04:48:43,340 --> 04:48:43,900
I don't know.

5073
04:48:44,619 --> 04:48:45,900
Do you think the world is going?

5074
04:48:45,900 --> 04:48:48,380
Do you think the rapture is going to happen in the next 12 months?

5075
04:48:50,380 --> 04:48:50,779
Probably.

5076
04:48:50,779 --> 04:48:51,580
Like, probably.

5077
04:48:51,580 --> 04:48:52,459
I'd say two years.

5078
04:48:54,240 --> 04:48:54,880
Actually, you know what?

5079
04:48:54,880 --> 04:48:56,479
I mean, this could be.

5080
04:48:56,479 --> 04:48:59,599
Let's start planning a vacation.

5081
04:49:02,479 --> 04:49:03,040
All right.

5082
04:49:03,040 --> 04:49:05,840
There's not very many nonbelievers, so.

5083
04:49:06,959 --> 04:49:08,400
I'm a blind samurai.

5084
04:49:08,400 --> 04:49:11,840
Let's go.

5085
04:49:18,369 --> 04:49:20,209
It's it's phase one.

5086
04:49:21,490 --> 04:49:23,060
It's Godfrey.

5087
04:49:23,060 --> 04:49:23,860
I can't enter.

5088
04:49:23,860 --> 04:49:25,939
I think you're in the cut scene that I've been wanting to watch.

5089
04:49:29,889 --> 04:49:31,709
There is no cut scene.

5090
04:49:34,990 --> 04:49:39,299
Godfrey Devouring Serpent.

5091
04:49:39,299 --> 04:49:42,340
It's a serpent that only likes to eat Godfrey's.

5092
04:49:42,340 --> 04:49:45,470
He's had one meal.

5093
04:49:46,110 --> 04:49:50,029
He's eaten once and it was enough.

5094
04:49:50,029 --> 04:49:52,990
Then the family found out that like, oh, they only eat Godfrey's.

5095
04:49:52,990 --> 04:49:54,750
Let's call our new son Godfrey.

5096
04:49:56,029 --> 04:50:04,349
He's probably got two phases.

5097
04:50:04,349 --> 04:50:04,990
Keep in mind.

5098
04:50:05,630 --> 04:50:06,430
That's true.

5099
04:50:22,939 --> 04:50:23,259
Quick.

5100
04:50:36,990 --> 04:50:38,270
Big smash.

5101
04:50:39,819 --> 04:50:42,619
That was so incredibly loud.

5102
04:50:43,580 --> 04:50:44,380
Actually was.

5103
04:50:44,380 --> 04:50:46,220
I wasn't going to say anything, but it was.

5104
04:50:46,220 --> 04:50:47,340
That was like you eating.

5105
04:50:48,619 --> 04:50:49,580
That was a big crunch.

5106
04:50:53,979 --> 04:50:55,419
This is a reenactment.

5107
04:50:56,880 --> 04:50:57,759
Oh, shit.

5108
04:50:57,759 --> 04:50:58,400
Oh, my God.

5109
04:50:59,200 --> 04:51:02,060
I'm just I'm just perma hit.

5110
04:51:08,779 --> 04:51:25,169
All I hear is, oh, oh, oh, my name is lagging to fucking shit, too.

5111
04:51:29,299 --> 04:51:31,779
It's really hard to dodge this when he's not doing them at you.

5112
04:51:32,500 --> 04:51:33,220
It actually is.

5113
04:51:35,650 --> 04:51:38,529
Oh, oh, oh, stir going down.

5114
04:51:39,330 --> 04:51:47,700
Okay.

5115
04:51:47,700 --> 04:51:48,500
Is there a phase two?

5116
04:51:49,380 --> 04:51:51,259
Please, mad soldier.

5117
04:51:51,819 --> 04:51:53,020
I'm out of healing.

5118
04:51:53,020 --> 04:52:00,299
Oh, together we shall be family or something.

5119
04:52:00,299 --> 04:52:00,860
I can't remember.

5120
04:52:01,500 --> 04:52:02,540
I'm watching the cut scene.

5121
04:52:09,919 --> 04:52:11,200
Who could it be, though?

5122
04:52:12,000 --> 04:52:19,709
For Dan, if it's for Dan, then we paid out a lot of money to the nonbelievers.

5123
04:53:02,020 --> 04:53:02,740
God looks like you.

5124
04:53:04,580 --> 04:53:07,220
You would talk over the exact moment where he says together.

5125
04:53:12,909 --> 04:53:14,750
It's oh, actually, this might suck.

5126
04:53:14,750 --> 04:53:15,470
It's margot.

5127
04:53:20,930 --> 04:53:21,490
Maybe not.

5128
04:53:22,049 --> 04:53:23,549
I think it'll be all right.

5129
04:53:24,619 --> 04:53:26,060
But doesn't Margot have a phase two?

5130
04:53:26,060 --> 04:53:28,700
Are we going to get like the phase two inception?

5131
04:53:29,500 --> 04:53:37,970
I'm like, that's what you mean.

5132
04:53:40,560 --> 04:53:41,360
Watch it on YouTube.

5133
04:53:42,080 --> 04:54:05,439
Oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking tomato at him.

5134
04:54:11,759 --> 04:54:13,759
He so badly wants you to die.

5135
04:54:13,759 --> 04:54:14,639
I have no help.

5136
04:54:14,639 --> 04:54:31,810
Oh, oh, he's got me.

5137
04:54:33,229 --> 04:54:34,909
Good thing I healed right there.

5138
04:54:48,750 --> 04:54:49,150
Epic.

5139
04:54:49,150 --> 04:55:08,810
believers let's go there's just four golden seeds I don't know what is with

5140
04:55:08,810 --> 04:55:14,380
my seed that I get all the seeds I'm guessing right there oh by the way rest

5141
04:55:14,380 --> 04:55:29,799
we come back see what happens when we come back here oh no oh dude you're

5172
04:59:58,439 --> 05:00:01,880
what else is going on that was that was your version of that no that was my

5173
05:00:01,880 --> 05:00:05,400
version of like we could just play tomorrow but now that playing tomorrow's

5174
05:00:05,400 --> 05:00:11,540
off the table because you took it away all right but like are you feeling all

5175
05:00:11,540 --> 05:00:15,580
right are you okay like we can stop right now if we stop playing I would

5176
05:00:15,580 --> 05:00:23,200
like eat a real meal and then I would honestly play Neo so it's fine are you

5177
05:00:23,200 --> 05:00:30,060
gonna stream Neo no god no no god no all right they'll tell me that I missed a

5178
05:00:30,060 --> 05:00:34,060
key pulse and I'll just it'll send me over the edge he wants to play Neo I

5179
05:00:34,060 --> 05:00:41,529
what you know explain you he wants to play a neo so bad all right well then

5180
05:00:41,529 --> 05:00:45,529
hello wait wait I have a proposition proposition for you okay proposition if

5181
05:00:45,529 --> 05:00:49,919
you want to play let's let's just go beat the game that will not take us

5182
05:00:49,919 --> 05:00:55,220
very long but then that means we're never playing again my what I wanted to

5183
05:00:55,220 --> 05:00:58,180
do is play tomorrow and what you're suggesting is to go beat the game so we

5184
05:00:58,180 --> 05:01:12,090
never have to play it again I mean that's not necessarily true it's just

5185
05:01:12,090 --> 05:01:18,709
when would you want to play again like if we're not playing tomorrow like we're

5186
05:01:18,709 --> 05:01:21,830
not playing tomorrow when would you like to play like another weekend thing like

5187
05:01:21,830 --> 05:01:28,020
Saturday and that's a long time that's kind of a long time like you just want

5188
05:01:28,020 --> 05:01:36,540
it we can go in the Elden tree now can we I mean we could we could just pick it

5189
05:01:36,540 --> 05:01:41,580
up again at some point and just in the next few days or something we don't have

5190
05:01:41,580 --> 05:01:45,979
to play it anymore we could just stop for now and just in like I don't know a

5191
05:01:45,979 --> 05:01:50,299
few days and like we don't have to wait till the weekend well I thought we had

5192
05:01:50,299 --> 05:01:57,900
to go through like the destroyed Landell we do when does that happen I think we

5193
05:01:57,900 --> 05:02:05,650
have to kill Malika who is inferno let's do Farrah Missoula man but they they

5194
05:02:05,650 --> 05:02:12,279
want it I I let me make this really really clear I am willing to play again

5195
05:02:12,279 --> 05:02:15,799
some other time in the next big this week or something if you really if you

5196
05:02:15,799 --> 05:02:21,939
want to get food and like just leave that's all good no I'm fine okay I'm

5197
05:02:21,939 --> 05:02:28,099
fine I'm just very you know like very sad you just did the the Neo case is on

5198
05:02:28,099 --> 05:02:32,180
your desk and you keep like looking at it I thought I wasn't gonna play Neo

5199
05:02:32,180 --> 05:02:36,340
until we beat Elden Ring because I don't want to mess up my brain again so then

5200
05:02:36,340 --> 05:02:40,409
okay so the next time we play this just let's beat this let's complete it so

5201
05:02:40,409 --> 05:02:45,599
then it's a complete arc and then we're good to go and we do whatever you can

5202
05:02:45,599 --> 05:02:49,259
just go back to playing a yo and whatever and then we're never gonna talk

5203
05:02:49,259 --> 05:02:57,240
again I'm and I'm already in the best timeline right now let's go to

5204
05:02:57,240 --> 05:03:05,130

5208
05:03:28,310 --> 05:03:31,950

5209
05:03:31,950 --> 05:03:36,270

5253
05:10:56,849 --> 05:11:11,009
off you don't have to do it let's go I'm just fucking rolled off the edge I've

5254
05:11:11,009 --> 05:11:29,950
only picked up smithing stone sevens blaster so you're gonna rent out a

5255
05:11:29,950 --> 05:11:41,569
studio for the scream stream or you're going to like just do it at home I don't

5256
05:11:41,569 --> 05:11:52,169
whatever you said all right this is it where are they oh it's this guy this

5257
05:11:52,169 --> 05:11:58,369
this I did not like this guy and I did not like millennia this guy is my

5258
05:11:58,369 --> 05:12:05,540
millennia really I think we'll be all right we're pretty level I think he's

5259
05:12:05,540 --> 05:12:11,299
lower HP probably but like this guy she's why do I feel like half the bosses

5260
05:12:11,299 --> 05:12:19,860
we fought had this music I feel like it was the only music we've heard this is

5261
05:12:19,860 --> 05:12:40,860
the Elden ring boss music for all we are concerned this guy's attacks are just

5262
05:12:40,860 --> 05:12:44,380
totally random at least millennia goes up in the air and lets you know she's

5263
05:12:44,380 --> 05:12:47,860
gonna do some bullshit this guy's just like constantly spinning in circles and

5264
05:12:47,860 --> 05:12:50,979
summoning guys and there's frostbite everywhere and you can't see your screen

5265
05:12:50,979 --> 05:12:58,430
that's like a thousand particle effects and he's got the boys with him not

5266
05:12:58,430 --> 05:13:01,509
anymore what is he even doing right now what is he doing

5267
05:13:01,549 --> 05:13:06,110
it's a big what is the big circle splash and then he goes down and you have an

5268
05:13:06,110 --> 05:13:18,250
opportunity to hit him well did you yes look at her honestly how is this guy

5269
05:13:18,250 --> 05:13:32,049
not Elden fucking Lord it doesn't want it horror Lou is a naked guy he seems to

5270
05:13:32,049 --> 05:13:40,860
be doing this move a lot though would you would you do any other move maybe

5271
05:13:40,860 --> 05:14:31,159
well at least it doesn't heal when he hits you they should why me I'm out of

5272
05:14:31,639 --> 05:15:02,790
we got it don't worry I'm here I'm here thanks big bro see nothing bad yeah well

5273
05:15:02,790 --> 05:15:25,900
millennia was actually easier it's a lot of souls holy shit actually can do it

5274
05:15:25,900 --> 05:15:33,779
again and do it a couple more times actually can't I 60 strength do it oh

5275
05:15:33,779 --> 05:15:47,810
yeah let's go oh yeah yeah okay cool wrong door where my my souls in here no

5276
05:15:48,009 --> 05:15:56,799
I got out yeah we got a bell free key another one is this the wrong way too

5277
05:15:56,799 --> 05:16:01,959
there's like three doors in this room you we go up no you're wrong no no no no

5278
05:16:01,959 --> 05:16:07,439
no this door no no this door don't we go we go up around we go into this door

5279
05:16:07,439 --> 05:16:20,209
then you get the bonfire right next to the bonfire this way that way there's a

5280
05:16:20,209 --> 05:16:24,740
lot of people die on those stairs this way that way this way that way this is

5281
05:16:24,740 --> 05:16:31,029
the wrong way I was listening to you your first mistake when he said it last

5282
05:16:31,029 --> 05:16:39,099
honestly stir is scarier than Jerma scarier reading I'm just reading what

5283
05:16:39,099 --> 05:16:54,930
they said what have I done that's scary I don't know I think it's cuz the shit

5284
05:16:54,930 --> 05:16:58,130
your pants story well I think that they're having trouble getting over that

5285
05:16:58,130 --> 05:17:07,540
this is not the right way this is just like regular Zula there that's the guy

5286
05:17:07,540 --> 05:17:23,229

05:25:47,430 --> 05:26:00,909
Wow Wow that's my favorite okay guy the last like year or so really has felt

5346
05:26:00,909 --> 05:26:06,450
like everyone all at once made the like four-player co-op game it really a lot

5347
05:26:06,450 --> 05:26:11,490
of them it feels like something that happens in waves do you remember all the

5348
05:26:11,490 --> 05:26:16,250
seemed like everybody was making a VR game everybody was making the League of

5349
05:26:16,250 --> 05:26:22,130
Legends kind of you know pop down game there's been like five years from now

5350
05:26:22,130 --> 05:26:26,270
there's gonna be like six Elden Ring likes come out because everyone got like

5351
05:26:26,270 --> 05:26:30,250
all do this game so good let's make one all at the same time I like that kind of

5352
05:26:30,250 --> 05:26:35,060
started happening like a lot I mean they made a Star Wars game that was like a

5353
05:26:35,060 --> 05:26:44,840
souls like I think which one did I fall in order is a souls like I guess I mean

5354
05:26:44,840 --> 05:26:52,509
it is I never played it but it seemed that way it is 100% a souls like they're

5355
05:26:52,509 --> 05:26:58,409
just called action RPGs dude no I you cannot tell me that fallen order is not

5356
05:26:58,409 --> 05:27:35,659
supposed to be a souls like come on it is oh you want to um you want to just go

5357
05:27:35,659 --> 05:27:45,020
check and see if it's if it was down here yeah can we even activate it this

5358
05:27:45,020 --> 05:27:59,220
is I think so you just lay down in it get the bonfire first though for sure you

5359
05:27:59,220 --> 05:28:05,779
just have to lie down that's good just have to lie down and let it happen where

5360
05:28:05,779 --> 05:28:12,590
is the bonfire we miss it I don't know if there's like an elevator around here

5361
05:28:12,590 --> 05:28:23,380
oh it's right here on the elevator all right I'll send it back for you no I'm

5362
05:28:23,380 --> 05:28:29,729
good I'm nice like that I'll set it back for you that play secure oh I did I

5363
05:28:29,729 --> 05:28:38,740
completed secure oh I beat the whole thing true ending and that game was a

5364
05:28:38,740 --> 05:28:46,569
living hell oh on that note you're asking like secure over near or was

5365
05:28:46,569 --> 05:28:49,810
harder right I feel like there's some people in chat like to case you stop

5366
05:28:49,810 --> 05:28:56,290
bringing up but like you did ask no I did the game is harder than secure oh

5367
05:28:56,290 --> 05:29:02,209
for sure why do they all come in here they all heard you these are people in

5368
05:29:02,209 --> 05:29:08,500
chat that were very mad that you just said that yeah I know no no but people

5369
05:29:08,779 --> 05:29:13,099
Neo being harder was I think the general consensus when you brought it up or five

5370
05:29:13,099 --> 05:29:18,819
yeah and and I can confirm I was like yeah this was uh was the safe place to

5371
05:29:18,819 --> 05:29:28,669
drop wait is if I gotta go down just jump dude no go down the hero is the

5372
05:29:28,669 --> 05:29:32,549
easiest from software game secure is easier than Elden ring I don't think so

5373
05:29:32,549 --> 05:29:48,279
I feel like secure oh punishes you way more than Elden ring does if you miss a

5374
05:29:48,319 --> 05:29:53,869
couple of those parries you can just get caught and just you dead it's over we

5375
05:29:53,869 --> 05:30:08,299
have to go I think we have to cross yeah it's like you I'm seriously just jumped

5376
05:30:08,299 --> 05:30:11,060
right there I'm doing the fucking hard one you didn't you did the one on the

5377
05:30:11,060 --> 05:30:18,490

5378
05:30:18,490 --> 05:30:32,459
did I where do you drop down where is it your chat says wrong way guys yeah do

5379

if we did stealth what do you mean what if we like like we just stealth in

5494
05:53:43,799 --> 05:53:47,930
because we know where he is and we backstab him no what we need to just

5495
05:53:47,930 --> 05:53:51,090
stand over here let's just fight him over here but like you have to actually

5496
05:53:51,090 --> 05:53:54,490

5498
05:54:00,389 --> 05:54:12,029
there he goes he's gonna do a weird side jump but he's gonna go right down I don't

5499
05:54:12,029 --> 05:54:18,619
know why he fell off like his normal arena has places he can jump off he's

5500
05:54:18,619 --> 05:54:34,180
so pissed over over here actually not a bad space place for him to be oh he

5501
05:54:34,180 --> 05:55:17,349
almost did it he actually almost did it how does he know oh here he goes there

5502
05:55:17,349 --> 05:55:29,040
he goes he's dead see you later he does the jumps on the pillars and it's like

5503
05:55:29,040 --> 05:55:34,619
he tried to jump to another pillar that didn't exist it just did a wily coyote

5504
05:55:34,619 --> 05:56:01,000
straight down nice I saw bullshit there shouldn't be ring outs okay there is

5505
05:56:01,000 --> 05:56:05,000
still an opportunity for this to go really wrong and if it's radan is there's

5506
05:56:05,000 --> 05:56:16,939
only two more opportunities praying for a mad soldier he'll be on the horse too

5507
05:56:16,939 --> 05:56:27,869
won't he that's gonna be a disaster yeah just wait it's gonna be so

5508
05:56:27,869 --> 05:56:31,869
anticlimactic we're gonna get to we're gonna get an urn tree avatar and then an

5509
05:56:31,869 --> 05:56:38,119
urn tree avatar that's kind of I really want it to just be like just said you

5512

05:57:11,439 --> 05:57:25,880
snail and it's free I remember this one should be two phases as well yep radan

5514
05:57:25,880 --> 05:57:31,580
is easy not in the area we're about to go to also when you say that statement

5531
06:00:50,880 --> 06:00:57,200
pretty rough I don't think it's impossible but if don't say it but if

5532
06:00:57,200 --> 06:01:02,799
we're Dan is phase two I gotta say I'm impressed the lore lines up seamless

5533
06:01:02,799 --> 06:01:09,659
co-op but we're gonna be joint Eldon Lords accurate like yeah Eldon Lords are

5534
06:01:09,659 --> 06:01:15,740
always couples apparently it's like a it's weird it's in the lore I mean it's

5539
06:01:44,490 --> 06:02:06,700

5540
06:02:06,700 --> 06:02:10,580
we do a big big focus on the first one damage damage damage I think we're

5541

06:16:02,939 --> 06:16:26,669
moderate but the music too is perfect stop doing that this really just wants

5603
06:16:26,669 --> 06:17:04,650
the string to keep going oh god damn it he's so like wiggly by the way from

5604
06:17:04,650 --> 06:17:13,319
person who gets the last hit is the Eldon Lord so it works oh he's so far

5605
06:17:13,319 --> 06:17:36,250
away I got robbed yes my yes my lord that's my first rule put on these

5607
06:17:53,090 --> 06:18:05,400
rules now you put on the cat ears I was born for this that's the worst day for

5608
06:18:05,400 --> 06:18:11,090
doubters you had a pretty good chance I'll be honest we're Dan still in the

5609
06:18:11,250 --> 06:18:18,139
mix radigan still in the my voice is just gone screaming for like six hours

5610
06:18:18,139 --> 06:18:26,840
yeah even say a lot of weird stuff maybe a dragon to a dragon in that first area

5611
06:18:26,840 --> 06:18:38,549
would have been pretty terrible what ending did we even get Dongita we didn't

5612
06:18:38,549 --> 06:19:01,819
do anything put the head in the cup bowing me like I don't know

5613
06:19:10,040 --> 06:19:20,119
became that vote must have been like more than 50% assuming we would lose

5614
06:19:20,119 --> 06:19:27,860
between now it was it was 26 million versus 31 million 31 was no a lot of

5615
06:19:27,860 --> 06:19:32,779
people lost points right there that's 31 million points gone from whoever had

5616
06:19:32,779 --> 06:19:55,299
him mimic tear it's like that's probably underneath soldier of Godric that

5617
06:19:55,380 --> 06:20:16,400
secret ending what wait what oh we died that's that's half a million souls gone

5618
06:20:16,400 --> 06:20:26,349
by the way unfortunate oh that's not good all right I was gonna change the

5619
06:20:26,349 --> 06:20:30,229
world I became Eldon Lord and then I accidentally no clipped through the earth

5620
06:20:30,229 --> 06:20:44,529
all that power I know what to do with it let's respect our bill one last time you

5621
06:20:44,529 --> 06:20:50,909
know actually know we can do can we actually go and do the via boss as well

5622
06:20:50,909 --> 06:21:09,599
I guess right I guess now do PvP PvP for true Eldon Lord I don't know how we how

5623
06:21:09,599 --> 06:21:13,080
do we would we even fight each other same way that we did it accidentally

5624
06:21:13,080 --> 06:21:22,639
before okay don't don't we have like a third party my guy doing I don't know

5625
06:21:22,639 --> 06:21:27,000
are you controlling him your character no no I pressed be be held and I just

5626
06:21:27,000 --> 06:21:29,919
started walking at her but then I missed because you like walked in front

5627
06:21:29,919 --> 06:21:44,650
of her I wanted to be held let me be held no let me in here please let me in

5628
06:21:44,650 --> 06:22:25,849
here it's weird I didn't do anything okay we're missing the item oh my god

5629
06:22:25,889 --> 06:22:40,759
when you hit her she bursts broken in this mod owned all right well then you

5630
06:22:40,759 --> 06:22:44,880
got what you want it we don't have to play anymore hey it's not what I said

5631
06:22:44,880 --> 06:22:56,279
it's over forever hey it's not goodbye it's I'll see you in a few years maybe

5632
06:22:56,279 --> 06:23:06,919
alright 2025 is there anything you want to clean up where you want to go how do

5633
06:23:06,919 --> 06:23:15,430
you feel now I mean we can't really just go backwards after you kill the

5634
06:23:15,430 --> 06:23:19,169
mimic to your Eldon Lord that's true the only thing we would find was radan

5635
06:23:19,169 --> 06:23:27,459
wherever radan was or ratagon which is probably no cron if we went to go fight

5636
06:23:27,459 --> 06:23:33,310
Moog I feel like that would be radon and probably if it was like both of them

5637
06:23:33,310 --> 06:23:37,470
because it seemed to be putting the strong bosses and strong boss places

5638
06:23:37,470 --> 06:23:45,099
true that's the true ending fight well that was really fun that was actually a

5639
06:23:45,099 --> 06:23:53,240
really good time a pleasure all good things all all art must be finite yeah

5640
06:23:53,240 --> 06:24:06,380
let Nexon publish Elden Ring online is that's fun that was the seamless co-op

5641
06:24:06,380 --> 06:24:13,319
seamless co-op works pretty flawlessly we the only problems we had were very

5642
06:24:13,319 --> 06:24:19,360
very just minor basic very very easy to fix problems like oh my game crashed

5643
06:24:19,360 --> 06:24:23,759
once every few hours or something it's really not a big deal there were really

5644
06:24:23,759 --> 06:24:31,360
like none today too and it was really smooth as mod makers give round of

5645
06:24:31,360 --> 06:24:39,310
applause without without the person made this mod we can't do seamless co-op like

5646
06:24:39,310 --> 06:24:46,860
this it goes for anybody yeah all joke ending yeah it was perfect

5647
06:24:47,020 --> 06:24:52,619
all right dude hey what do you have to do it like we could do whatever you want

5648
06:24:52,619 --> 06:24:56,270
to play something I don't know we'll figure something out if we place them

5649
06:24:56,270 --> 06:25:03,560
again we'll always figure something out always yeah literally always good night

5650
06:25:03,560 --> 06:25:12,000
yeah take care see you later Esther do neo 2 co-op I don't think I want to play

5651
06:25:12,000 --> 06:25:24,639

5652
06:25:24,639 --> 06:25:31,369
true we literally just played that firefighter game like two weeks ago yeah
