1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,029
Somebody said, who's your favorite Vocaloid?

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:25,230
I don't know, I didn't know there was that many.

3
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,660
You done peeing? Yeah, I am done peeing.

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,289
You guys ready for Pac-Man Museum?

5
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:36,859
I'm gonna turn it down, at least not too loud.

6
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:42,140
I don't even know what this is.

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:53,899
We're about to find out. Yep.

8
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,609
Alright, let me capture this.

9
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,850
Max FPS.

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,409
No, that's fine.

11
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:05,900
Uh, that's fine.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
Borderless window, yeah.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,459
Okay, it's very loud.

14
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:13,459
Let me turn this down first.

15
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,799
I actually can't turn it down.

16
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,459
I have to go to the source here.

17
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,459
Alright, let's get back.

18
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:37,819
You can't see it yet, but you will in a minute.

19
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:38,819
Putting it together.

20
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:44,659
Pac-Man.

21
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,930
Where are you?

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:02:00,950
There you are.

23
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,760
So, let's go.

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,759
What are they doing?

25
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,009
What the fuck is going on?

26
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:22,680
Alright.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,860
Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Arcade.

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,860
In this arcade, you can choose coins to play a variety of Pac-Man.

29
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,479
Oh, shut them all. Everybody shut up.

30
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,479
Welcome to Pac-Man Museum Plus.

31
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,379
In this arcade, you can use coins to play a variety of Pac-Man games.

32
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,379
When you want to play a game, move in front of it and select play.

33
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,379
The game will start.

34
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:47,949
While in the arcade, press Y to open the menu.

35
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:58,979
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

36
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,500
This place is fucking annoying.

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,189
I wouldn't want to be in here for more than five minutes.

38
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:14,770
Alright, what do they have for machines?

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,770
Gashapon?

40
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,840
Spend coins on the Gashapon to get here.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I don't know how you...

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:39,849
Is it supposed to sound like this?

43
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:40,849
I gotta get out of here.

44
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,430
Alright, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania.

45
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:52,620
Huh?

46
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:10,759
Okay, I was gonna say I thought it was gonna be that small.

47
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,759
Let's get a few extra lives.

48
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:22,089
Got him.

49
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,250
It sounds like Miku.

50
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,379
It does.

51
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:36,769
This sounds like Miku.

52
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:46,430
I can't escape that game.

53
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,990
It really sounds like Miku.

54
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,990
I feel like my voice has changed in the last hour.

55
00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:20,930
Got him.

56
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on, come on.

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,620
Come on, Gwen.

58
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,620
Come on, Gwen.

59
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:56,370
You can jump?

60
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:07,810
What? I didn't know you could jump.

61
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:23,939
I'm never gonna get caught by a ghost ever again.

62
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,420
One, two, three, four.

63
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:53,170
Ooh!

64
00:06:53,170 --> 00:08:03,509
How do we get a cutscene?

65
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:04,509
This is the best song.

66
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:38,610
This is the best song they've ever made.

67
00:08:38,610 --> 00:09:11,700
What the fuck was that double bounce?

68
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:20,360
Screen settings?

69
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,289
No, I don't want to see her teeth.

70
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,289
I want the bigger screen though.

71
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:28,580
That's better.

72
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:49,850
Are you okay?

73
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,850
Yeah.

74
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:58,809
I wasn't looking.

75
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:02,289
I wasn't looking.

76
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,870
That's fine.

77
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:14,820
Alright, it doesn't matter.

78
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
I got four style...

79
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
I got four coins.

80
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,210
That's it?

81
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:28,210
I unlocked Pac-Mania cabinet, a gold container.

82
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,139
A...

83
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,139
Okay.

84
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,139
Please.

85
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,139
I got a cabinet.

86
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,139
Okay.

87
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,759
That fucking stung.

88
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,759
Stop.

89
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,759
Stop hitting me.

90
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,940
Stop slapping me.

91
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:57,470
This is the original Pac-Man.

92
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Play Pac-Man in time two times.

93
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,659
Do I have to do the original?

94
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,759
Pac-Land.

95
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,759
What's Pac-Land?

96
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:26,450
How do you play Pac-Land?

97
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,450
Oh my god, it's this fucking game.

98
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:39,500
To control Pac-Man, run with the end of the direction of the arrow.

99
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
How do you jump?

100
00:11:40,500 --> 00:12:15,269
I feel like I'm going max speed in Oregon Trail.

101
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,750
Stop.

102
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:27,539
I did it?

103
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:42,669
Let's go.

104
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:49,840
God, I'm gonna play that Bugs Bunny Smash Bros. game again.

105
00:12:49,840 --> 00:13:08,210
So is that thing down there a timer?

106
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,690
That's money.

107
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,690
Oh, that's such bullshit when that happens.

108
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,690
Absolute horseshit.

109
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,730
Just total horseshit.

110
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Play multiverses again?

111
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,730
I can't.

112
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,029
They turned it off.

113
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,029
The alpha's gone now.

114
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,029
They closed it.

115
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:41,399
When's it release?

116
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,399
Uh, July, I think.

117
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
July's the open beta.

118
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:57,799
This game's awful.

119
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:07,450
Alright, now what?

120
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,450
Get rid of Pac-Man?

121
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:18,500
At least it shuts up the people.

122
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:47,809
Okay, at least we can get away from that fucking song.

123
00:14:47,809 --> 00:15:19,539
Oh, here it is.

124
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:21,539
The one where you could jump was really actually good.

125
00:15:21,539 --> 00:16:18,950
Oh!

126
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:58,179
Here it comes.

127
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:29,859
I fucked this whole thing up so bad.

128
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:49,019
I tried to press up.

129
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:50,019
This game's fucking stupid.

130
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,480
Wait, what?

131
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
I didn't press it that many times!

132
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:16,450
Did you guys know that Pac-Man was originally gonna be a pizza game?

133
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:21,410
It was like you put like sauce and cheese on the pizza and stuff and you put it in the oven, but the game director

134
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,519
The putting the sauce on the pizza sound sounded so funny to the director of the game that

135
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,799
It's just like which probably maybe we should change it to like an eating thing or the pizza eats things

136
00:18:44,920 --> 00:19:26,799
You lying come so easily to you. I'm not a liar. I'm a performer. Shut up. It's a performance. Shut up

137
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:45,740
I'm a performer. This dude is wicked soy. I'm fine. That was fun

138
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:54,680
Who he was gonna be called puck man. No, it's pizza man

139
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,680
Play pac-man two times. Okay, so I have to play this two times to unlock super pac-man. All right, I played it twice

140
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:33,039
All right, come kill me they found out in the US kids would edit the P on the machine to an F

141
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:52,039
Remember this sucks go back to Miku. I can't I'm too burnt out to do Miku. I can't do Miku

142
00:20:52,039 --> 00:21:03,880
I can't play Miku anymore. I'm prime bars out from all the flashing colors Miku or riot. No, I can't right now

143
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm just tired now. Look, I've got I unlocked um pac-man super pac-man. There we go. All right

144
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,079
What is super pac-man?

145
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:42,630
I've ever played this

146
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,509
Same one

147
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:49,640
This looks fucking weird. What the hell is this? I

148
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:11,359
Interesting don't you get all the keys pac-man would never eat eggs. They're too healthy. Wait, he eats fruits

149
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:26,039
Please my ears. It looks like it's turned on

150
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:43,339
What the fuck I got all the fruits it's all the keys

151
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:49,640
This is the kind of game that I would get

152
00:22:49,720 --> 00:23:03,450
like my grandfather on his steam of his first steam account and I would go to check a year from now to see what my

153
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,579
grandfather had in his steam library, and it would be this and

154
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,400
I don't know dead space one and two because it's on sale for three dollars every year

155
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:30,440
It's the only games you have and all the free-to-play stuff and you'd go on it and see how much time that grandpa had

156
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,250
Playtime he hadn't even opened him

157
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,119
500 hours on path of exile

158
00:23:52,839 --> 00:24:06,680
They go too fast. I I never was a fan of pac-man. I

159
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,920
Was I was never a fan of pac-man?

160
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,009
I was always I was more of a fan of pac-man's character than I was his video games

161
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,230
Pac-man super pac-man pac-mania

162
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,910
pac-man battle royale

163
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:34,789
pac-land pac-man

164
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:38,710
arrangement

165
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,910
Pac-pal

166
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:48,619
Okay, let me do pac-man battle royale say it and so I love pac-man

167
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:57,259
He's the greatest video game character ever but his I don't know these games were kind of the originals great

168
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:02,839
Pac-man's great adventure is great the one where you have to like point him in directions and help him

169
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:18,160
Why is that not here? This one's good, okay?

170
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,670
Eat power pellets

171
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,369
He's a cannibal

172
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:45,319
Fight how do I how do you win? Wait? You don't how do you hurt each other? I don't understand. What's going on?

173
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,069
Do I have to wait to eat each other? Ah

174
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:17,940
All right, that's all right. So I've won wait for next round. This is zoomer pac-man. No, it's not money in I guess

175
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:28,420
You play with like four people. That's fine. Does everyone have to have their own controller at the arcade cabinet. That would be fun

176
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,039
Kiss the CPU

177
00:26:46,039 --> 00:27:03,089
Lost to CPU. How come there's only one CPU? That's weird. It's gonna be way more

178
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:30,500
That's how did I just lose that? You only have one CPU in your computer. You only have one CPU

179
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,000
All right. This this one sucks. This would be fun with like four actual friends sitting around

180
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:46,769
This is a scuffed version of championship edition

181
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:58,740
They have these at tape. They have these at I think they have these as table machines in some arcades

182
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,000
That makes sense

183
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:18,869
What's wrong? I'm not even paying attention. What just happened? Why is the sound getting faster?

184
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
This is a Dave and Buster's game

185
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,359
It really is

186
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,359
This is a game at Dave and Buster's

187
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,329
That's so funny

188
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:40,450
Yeah, and it spits out like 10 tickets

189
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,890
The shit you like. Oh great. Cool. That was fun. I guess I got like eight tickets

190
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:54,920
This literally is at Dave and Buster's

191
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:14,440
No, is it? No, it's not

192
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,559
It actually is deal or no deal is the best arcade game

193
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,390
Now we can maybe should I play dear or no deal on stream? I think it'd be fun

194
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:49,750
All right. Well that game was fun. It's fine. It's fine. My turn like pack land two times

195
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:56,000
I want to know what pack pal is right pack mania and pack land. Where's pack land?

196
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,410
Okay, so it's gonna open this and then close it because what is pack pal?

197
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,950
Oh it knows

198
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:23,160
I have to actually get in and die. This one was actually the best one

199
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
There's more games in the big machine

200
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:38,930
What was the pac-man game you played you made a video on like 10 years ago?

201
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,009
That's pac-man to the great adventure or something

202
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
It's not a pac-man game

203
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
It's a side scrolling directions game. It's really weird

204
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,160
I wonder if there's uh, if they might be in it

205
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,750
This one has a final boss it's not in this how why would this not is it a licensing problem?

206
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,589
I thought that was gonna be on here. That's why I want that's why I bought the game

207
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,109
I thought it was a pac-man museum plus. Okay, let's go

208
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,589
packing time

209
00:31:25,589 --> 00:31:27,589
That's one of them that i'm thinking of right?

210
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:40,210
Okay, well what's pac-man arrangement, how do I not even know these games came out?

211
00:31:50,210 --> 00:32:00,769
Instructions i've been i've been playing video games for

212
00:32:01,569 --> 00:32:04,880
30 years

213
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
I feel like these were all made up today

214
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,960
And i'm being gaslit into thinking these are real

215
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,190
Well, i've never heard of these

216
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:42,630
Why is there a bunny?

217
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,630
This one's actually fun

218
00:32:44,630 --> 00:33:00,319
I like this one. This one was good dash. Whoa. All right, that's cool

219
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:25,799
It's awesome just kind of fun to do that

220
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,940
Whoa, wait, you can do that

221
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:53,319
That's helpful pac-man arrangement that would have weird name. Is that why this game didn't do that? Well, because it's called pac-man

222
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,240
arrangement

223
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,819
I thought it was gonna be I thought I was gonna be making flowers or something

224
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,799
Painting game. I don't think it was gonna be an actual pac-man game

225
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:38,369
Get them all good go

226
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,849
Oh, i'm in trouble

227
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:44,849
Actually in trouble. Nope. I'm good

228
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,840
Why wouldn't it be a pac-man game?

229
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh, they've made some weird ass pac-man games over the last 20 years

230
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,659
big fucking deal

231
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:58,309
I missed one little pellet really they make a weird noise. What's the they go?

232
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:10,210
Oh

233
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:18,769
You should have a pac-man themed wedding. I thought I would wait. I thought that was it. I thought this was a bonus stage

234
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,829
What the fuck?

235
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:56,400
Throwing for pac content. It is a bonus round. Okay. That was I don't know why I just got invincibility frames for a second

236
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,920
That was weird

237
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:22,449
Shit bad. What I swear this fucking goddamn controller. What the hell?

238
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:49,190
Oh, no

239
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,630
I'm pressing the buttons. What the fuck?

240
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,280
I'm pressing die. It's just he's fucking hits a wall freezes, bro

241
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,159
bro, relax

242
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:04,179
That was fun

243
00:38:04,179 --> 00:38:09,840
I i'm literally pressing the button and just hits the wall and move this is what pac-man

244
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,730
Only works when you have the stick that has only the four directions

245
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:25,000
Anything else is impossible. You cannot play pac-man with a regular fucking controller. You have to have four one, two, three four

246
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:36,239
That's it return to arcade. Yes, please

247
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,969
Use the d-pad d-pad doesn't work either because sometimes you press up on a d-pad

248
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,519
It presses like left or right at the same time. I'm using an xbox one controller the d-pad

249
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:50,920
It's like all one gigantic button

250
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:02,019
You need a stick or arrow keys. Yeah, but i'm a fucking console gamer. Okay. Now what is it for this?

251
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,710
Play pac-lan two times

252
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:14,070
How about not play I already did play this once

253
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,539
Continue from pause date. Oh, I got sick. I got sick of it and didn't want to play anymore

254
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,090
Play deal or no deal. We'll do that on um on sunday

255
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,679
Here's your plan for sunday. We're gonna play we're gonna play um

256
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,719
trivia and and um game show games

257
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
How about who wants to be a millionaire?

258
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,329
deal or no deal

259
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:42,929
So maybe a couple others

260
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:51,429
We'll do that on sunday. I'm just trying to die

261
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,340
All right now back out come back in

262
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:08,679
I want to at least see each game once play the awful full-priced millionaire game that came out like a year ago

263
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:11,329
Yeah, it's probably when i'll play

264
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,590
Go buy more games

265
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,590
Hello, let me unlock these ones first

266
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:42,400
What about the oregon trail? I don't I think I have maybe once back during one of the dos nights. Maybe I think so

267
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,849
I just played it again. All right, let me be honest

268
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:14,949
I bought the fucking game. Do I have to really do you have to put all this shit under walls?

269
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,590
Like it's pac-man museum. Do I really have to do all this to play the pac-man games? I want to play

270
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,949
It's not a it's a museum. It's I don't I don't have to go look

271
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,829
At the mona lisa to unlock

272
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:45,750
The other fucking paintings in the museum if it's a museum just put it in the museum. Just put it in the museum

273
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:49,619
Just put it put it for display in the museum

274
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,000
Unlocking things is fun. You joyless husker human

275
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:38,739
Okay, can I please play the other game hacking pal eat the turn over the card and eat the flashing item give it back

276
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:45,409
I'm good. She's safe touch a ghost and you'll lose turn the tables with a special item press the button

277
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,119
That kind of hurts my head to look at

278
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:46,820
Eat the s we did it

279
00:43:49,360 --> 00:44:08,210
One with the hat was better. I get the idea. The concept is interesting, right? But I

280
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,030
It's just modded pac-man

281
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,400
It's pretty awful

282
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:35,250
I'd say it's very awful. It's a less fun pac-man

283
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:38,289
Okay, so what are there any others I can do?

284
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,530
This one play pack in time two times. Where's pack in time?

285
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:49,199
Do I have to buy it?

286
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:06,480
What do I get it how do I get um pack in time

287
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,480
It's the big one

288
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:20,050
I can't play it pause saving is not supported. Oh, what the fuck

289
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:42,639
Our hero pac-man is the cool video game dude, we know and love okay

290
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,900
When the evil ghost witch and her ghost monsters invaded his world pac-man was there to defend it

291
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:57,280
Since then he's been living happily with his family in pac-land

292
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:09,300
But his fiendish arch enemy the ghost witch has vowed to disrupt his tranquil life

293
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:25,360
Okay, following the failure of her diabolical plan. She decided to eliminate pac-man once and for all the ghost which cast a

294
00:46:27,429 --> 00:46:32,599
Forbidden spell on pac-man ripping him from his family. Oh my god

295
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,849
And hurling him through time to his dangerous past

296
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:47,000
The journey back in time transformed pac-man into a young pack boy

297
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:57,030
And the only change is he doesn't have a nose anymore the ghost witch sent him to a world which has never heard of the hero pac-man

298
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:05,750
though the witch's foul magic

299
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:17,860
The inhabitants of a once beautiful land have turned against him and the ghost witch's loyal ghost will do everything possible to keep him prisoner

300
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,829
Look at how cute he is

301
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,829
I love this version of pac-man

302
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:29,829
He's so cute let's find out

303
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,190
Okay

304
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,630
mountain

305
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:58,440
Huh? You have a it's like mega man

306
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:14,449
Are they trying to make okay the shoes the fast running they just try to make a sonic the hedgehog version

307
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:32,119
What does that do?

308
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,409
He's so stumpy how do I open this

309
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:56,469
How do I open the chest?

310
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,309
He looks like one of those custom south park characters that everybody used to have

311
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,269
Do you remember that?

312
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:17,030
Can I can I swim?

313
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:24,800
I need a key

314
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,760
Ah

315
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,159
I can't swim

316
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:48,340
Bro, I don't see somebody playing mega man that knows what they're doing and they're really good at the game

317
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:59,679
Some of the speed runners, right? It's always like they just like brr brr brr when they jump. It's crazy

318
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:02,239
How do I get through here?

319
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:12,920
Can I swim? I can't swim down

320
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,280
Use the item

321
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:29,090
What item?

322
00:50:29,090 --> 00:51:11,349
A change. Oh left bumper. Somebody just said this sucks. How do I get down here? How do I break this?

323
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,400
Can I drop down? I need a hammer press a

324
00:51:24,039 --> 00:52:28,690
Is there another item? These controls are gonna slow down slow down get the water hammer. Where is it?

325
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:36,550
This is worse than glover. No, it's not

326
00:52:40,579 --> 00:53:20,239
Where's this hammer? It's in the water of what get me out of here. How do I get in the fucking exit?

327
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:52,019
I need all the rings all the dots. I can't even get back up here guys. I'm fucking screwed

328
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
I can't beat the level anymore

329
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:08,530
Where's the rope?

330
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,530
Why did the rope get taken from me?

331
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:16,130
somebody said

332
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,130
Reviewer gameplay. Oh, please

333
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:24,449
You don't know how hard this is to control. It's so weird

334
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:43,539
Ow

335
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:47,190
It's really weird kid. I think they're up here

336
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:06,440
He's so bouncy. It's weird. It's it's strange. Trust me. I'm so impatient. I fucking can't do it

337
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:54,500
That's fine. I don't want to do that anymore

338
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,380
That was a really cute one, but I don't want to do that

339
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:04,519
Pack and roll remix

340
00:56:04,519 --> 00:57:05,039
Is this a game cube or something?

341
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:26,019
Is he yelling?

342
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:34,500
This is another Dave and Buster's game. I don't I disagree

343
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:18,550

345
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,679
Get up there

346
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:46,679
It's driving me fucking crazy

347
00:58:46,920 --> 00:59:12,079
It's just you like you can't control it. It's it just be so bouncy

348
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:30,389
He's so bouncy in these games. It's ridiculous, but I have to play this again. He goes too fast and he's too bouncy

349
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,480
I feel like my mouse sensitivity is too high

350
00:59:34,280 --> 01:00:09,940
I games like these just drive me fucking crazy

351
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:16,400
I remember when I was a little kid snake rattle and roll. I I tried to break the nintendo controller in half

352
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:20,710
Like bending it this way because I couldn't I hated it so much

353
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,679
And all it did was just made really loud crackling sounds

354
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,880
like I was not strong enough to break it obviously, so it was just like

355
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,760
All you heard was just crunching stuff

356
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:47,570
Not strong enough to break it but strong enough to like kind of fuck it up

357
01:00:48,210 --> 01:01:03,670
Just get me out of here. I don't want to play this snake rattle and roll is good. You just bad

358
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,150

411
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:36,140
That's actually the best one so far orange always goes down

412
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:46,869
