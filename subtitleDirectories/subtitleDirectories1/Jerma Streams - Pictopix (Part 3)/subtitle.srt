1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:16,739
I scare you. Alright, let's begin a wind down here. I'm gonna play a few pick-cross levels,

2
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:30,149
we'll just chill. Gonna close out of Sekiro though. What's the total in-game time? Let's see,

3
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm curious. Because I saw articles, reviewers, other streamers talk about their game time,

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:46,759
I'm just curious what the actual in-game time was. Let's see, how long did it take me to beat

5
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:51,799
Sekiro? Let's see, the last hour, the last two hours or so was not finishing the game.

6
00:00:52,679 --> 00:01:06,500
Just wandering around, right? Let's see. I have 42 hours in Sekiro, so the last two hours or so

7
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:14,150
were spent kind of walking around doing optional stuff. So 40 hours. It took just about 40 hours

8
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,620
to beat the game. That sounds about right. And that's pretty much, most people have said, between

9
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:33,540
35 to 55 hours. 30 to 40 is average, yeah. Damn, it was fun. And that's the end of that.

10
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:45,260
Just finished my second playthrough at 45 hours. That sounds about right. Any thoughts on Borderlands

11
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:57,540
3? No, I'm not really a Borderlands fan, I never was. Dude, there's a PictoPix update from like a

12
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,359
week ago. Hello everybody, I'm very excited to announce that a new free update is available for

13
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:15,610
PictoPix. This update adds new content. We got new content, boys and girls. He hates Borderlands. I

14
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:23,020
just don't really like it. I don't hate it, but I don't really, I never really was a fan. Not that

15
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:46,229
I don't like the idea. Let's get it open here. It's not his cup of tea. Yeah, yeah. I watched

16
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:52,250
your first PictoPix stream and now I have 21 hours in the game. It's great. I'm so happy if you never

17
00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:07,909
even knew what PictoPix was, if you're into it now. PictoPix, there it is. There we go. Play.

18
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:20,819
Let's go classic. This is where we're at here. This is, is it linked to Twitch again? So you guys

19
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:39,930
can guess. Should be. Maybe not. Let me make sure it's, oops. Enable to, ah there we go. Let's turn

20
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:51,699
it on. Should be on now. There we go. Now you guys can guess what it is. So this is 15 by 15.

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:03,159
So we start off here. We got 10, 11. Can't really do much there. 8, 9, 10. I could get the 8,

22
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:12,099
but I just go like this and pretend. So that's 1. We got how many? 1. That's 14, 13. So 1, 2,

23
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:21,180
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I can probably go like this. So 8. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Maybe not,

24
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:30,009
because that would mean I'd have to go like kind of halfway through here. Let's see. 8,

25
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:50,980
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. I guess maybe like a couple of these could be between here. 9, 2,

26
00:04:50,980 --> 00:05:05,959
4, 6. Why is it telling like dad jokes? Why are there cat facts going on with Nightbot?

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:24,819
What? Let's see. 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, not 15. Not a whole lot to start with here.

28
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:35,449
I mean I guess you go 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. We know that. As long as this is correct, which it kind

29
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:50,550
of has to be. Now does that help anything else? Not really. I mean I guess here. Harder than Ishin.

30
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,389
Oh yeah, I can see 3. This has to be 1, 2, 3. It has to be here somewhere so there's no way it can

31
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:08,069
be any of these. This might be the 2. I can't really tell. The hardest decisions require the

32
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:17,029
strongest wills. I'm surprised I don't have anything here like at the bottom or down here.

33
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:35,500
Let me see. So that's 14, 13. Let me see here. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

34
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:46,949
So actually I don't know that info. I do not know that info. This makes it kind of worse though.

35
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:08,540
Where am I getting the two x's on the bottom? Well with the larger, you've got to look for

36
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,860
large numbers because you can fill them in because it has to be somewhere in the middle. But the

37
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,980
reason why I'm doing the bottom x's here is because there has to be a 1 in a space.

38
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:23,689
So there has to be at least two spaces before 8 is here. You know what I mean? So it can help

39
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:31,560
sometimes. This one's kind of tricky because there's really not much to go on right now.

40
00:07:31,560 --> 00:08:00,939
Because this is 14. So it's not 15 down. 7, 8, 9. I'm kind of stuck here. There's no way to tell

41
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:15,779
this is the 1 or the 2. What down here? Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

42
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:27,029
Now there's too many. It's too much. Too much of a space. See this one on the other hand,

43
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:36,179
you could mean, let's just look at it. Two spaces. It could be anywhere. It could be like this,

44
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:58,009
right? It's too hard to tell. Because hold on. 3, 2, 2. This is part of the 8. Let's see. 1,

45
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:11,259
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This is not enough to go on. Because this could be here, right? 1, 2, 3, 2,

46
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:46,090
2, 3, or this could be 3, or this could be 2. I need more info. Fuck. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

47
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:57,379
There's too many spaces. You've got five full spaces of space here that,

48
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:15,820
like, let's just say the overlap would have to be. That's too many. 4, 4, 3. It's just,

49
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,179
you really would have to just go like this. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go like this. So

50
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,200
this is probably close enough. So it's probably gonna be something like this.

51
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,980
At least these two. At least these two at least probably have to be filled in. Because if you do

52
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:50,389
1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3. I don't know. Because it could be like this then, right? The outlier here is this

53
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:59,740
one's always filled in. So this one has to be filled in. Therefore 1, 2, 3. This is 1, 2, 3.

54
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:13,820
All right. A little bit more info. Which leaves... Let's go like that. Let's just clear these.

55
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:38,840
All right. Where the fuck are we now? 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. If it was 4, I could fill in both of these.

56
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:51,960
It's not though. Oh, my brain is kind of on... I'm pretty slow right now. I'm not gonna lie.

57
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,059
I'm in like the post-securo fucking... I'm like about to fall asleep.

58
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:11,799
Uh, well there's no music playing right here. Let's put the jazz music on. There we go.

59
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:30,840
This is definitely part of the three at this point. Go to sleep. I'm all right for now.

60
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:47,289
I might just call it here in like 20 minutes. Uh, I gotta have something better than that.

61
00:12:52,330 --> 00:13:11,240
Fuck this one. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Oh, fuck that one.

62
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay, that's it for this. He died to Picross. We got 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Look at that.

63
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:46,200
Perfect. 13. Done. And so this is 1, 2, 3. Uh-huh. 1, 2, 3. Good. This... Let's see. Let's say it was

64
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:55,240
2 here. Let's just take a look. So we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's just say it's either here or here.

65
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,409
No way for me to do to get that. Let's just do it from here. So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

66
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:15,460
9, 10, 11, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 4 on each side. That works. Died to gridwheel. So this is 3, 1, 2. That

67
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:24,870
means this is done. Nothing else underneath it. There's the 1. And 1, 2, 3 has to be up here somewhere

68
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:41,659
like that. Speaking of 11s. 12, 13, 14, 15. 12, 13, 14, 15. All right. What do we got up here? 2, 1, 2.

69
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:56,019
That's a lot there. Let's see. What about down here? 2, 1. So there's the 2, 1, 2. This might be the

70
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:06,870
same thing. This is... Yeah, that's probably... That's the 2. So then look down here. 2, 3, 4.

71
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:17,480
It's blocking itself out. This is probably the 3 right here. Also 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4.

72
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,299
That makes this a little easier. There's your 1. 3. There's your 1 and your 2. This is 3.

73
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,129
3 in the middle, right? There you go. Bingo. There's your 2. There's your other 2. Part of the 7.

74
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:45,590
3, 3, 3. Looking good. 1, 1, 3. This is also that 1. It has to be a 3 here. So it could be

75
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,509
1, 2, 3. It could be 3 here. Either this side or this side. Can't really tell right now.

76
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:56,389
What about... What's going on over here? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. This is... This

77
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:05,370
might be already done here. Let's see. And then 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Not quite. 3 is definitely right

78
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:16,490
here in the middle though. Has to be. Same thing with the other one. That leaves us with... Let's

79
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:22,570
just take a second here. This is the... These are both... These are all 4s down here. So because

80
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:31,299
there's only 5 options, it's got to be all the ones in the bottom there. I would say the same

81
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:38,299
thing here. Unless we... Hold on. 1, 2, 3. Now it could be... It's possible. Although improbable,

82
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:44,389
but still... It is still possible. Because up here is also a 3. But it could be there.

83
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,230
Somebody came in and said, what is happening?

84
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:04,579
What are you doing? What is happening? 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Same deal. Does that help us over this way?

85
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:18,759
2, 1. Here is the 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We know it's the two middle ones. Now is that the 2? This is

86
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:36,339
the 1. This is also part of a 4. 2, 4. So it's got to be these ones. That's a 1. A 1, 2, 3, 4 again.

87
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:49,079
What about here? 2, 1. I've got nothing here. 1, 2. There it is. Simple. Absolute simple. Making a

88
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:55,960
picture. Yeah. The way that Picross works is you build out with these logic puzzles a picture.

89
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:09,799
If you do exclamation point guess, you can guess to see what it is. 1, 1, 3. It could be this.

90
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:26,440
1, 3, 2. No, this might be the 3. If that's the case. What about up top? 2. Somewhere in here.

91
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:39,640
1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. I mean, it has to be the middle ones. This is definitely the 1.

92
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:54,250
There's 2. And there's the other 2. This is harder than Sekiro. Some of that can be really,

93
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,710
really just challenging. That's the last one. I couldn't even. Sometimes you just sit there

94
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,230
and look at it and it doesn't click. Nothing clicks on it. You just skip and go to another one. There's

95
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:18,500
like hundreds of them. Hmm. Plane. Yeah, that was a plane rumor. Crashing by. Just flying by.

96
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:26,730
1, 2, 3, 4. Nothing there. All right, so hold on. Wait, wait. This has to be 3.

97
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:37,500
So if that's the case, then it can't be any of these. Oh, shit. So this is definitely the 3.

98
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm thinking the 3s. There's still one up here. So is that enough info to figure that out? This,

99
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,859
let's see. 1. Yeah, that has to be there. Unless I made a mistake, which I don't think I did.

100
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:09,819
And that's it for the 4. All three 4s. Somebody let me out of here. I'm in hell.

101
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:28,890
You're okay. Now let's see. Yeah, this is it. 1, 1, 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. 2, 1. Close. Close.

102
00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:48,650
Could be either one. Still don't know about this side. Are they meant to be all white? Yeah,

103
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:59,049
you'll see when it's complete, it turns into a colored picture. Is the 1 here or is the 1 here?

104
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:12,539
Probably here. This is a 5 here. This is, okay, hold on. Let's just say 2, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

105
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:22,950
No, the 5 is right here. There's the 2 and the 5. Here's the 1. Okay. These are all 1s, except

106
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:36,440
this one's a 2. Done. There's your 1. There's your 2. Oh, it feels good. Then we got 1. This is a 2.

107
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:48,009
And this is also a 2. That's part of the 11. 11's done. I think I can get some more of these in here.

108
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:54,490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. No, I can't.

109
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:07,019
And it's just happening so quickly now. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Middle can go.

110
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:26,500
It's on its way. All right. What is it? I don't know. 2. Let's say 2, 1. It's apparently a building.

111
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:45,450
Where is this 4? Oh, there's a 5. Here it is. So 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1.

112
00:22:46,329 --> 00:23:02,089
This is 11. Done. 3. Got it. That is done. This row's done. And then 7 here. So 7.

113
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:19,019
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Bingo. Done. The 1 has to be right there. 1, 2, 3, 11.

114
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:36,819
And that's it. It is a house. A hut. Who got it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Have you got it?

115
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:48,549
A hut. Nice work. So this is 15 by 15, but that's a lie. It's actually, that's 10.

116
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,960
This should be fairly easy to get a lot of these, because 8, 9, 10. The middle one's here.

117
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:08,890
6 is 4 on the sides. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. 7, 3. Okay. What about 5? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

118
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:19,509
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Sorry, sir. You can't do that. 11, though, is 4 on the sides.

119
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:32,680
We have to count up to 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

120
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:38,680
I can't really do anything else. All right. What we got to work with here? Anything else? We got

121
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:53,509
6, 8, 4, 7. 1, 2, 3, 4. X that one. 1, 2, 3, 4. It has to be up somewhere here. It's 11. All right.

122
00:24:53,589 --> 00:25:05,990
So 3, 8, 5, 1, 3. I wonder if this is the 5, probably. And then if that's the 1,

123
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:22,839
we got 1, 2, 3, maybe. Could go here. If this is 1, 2, 3, that has to be the same. This is definitely

124
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:36,890
the second 3, because there's not enough room for it there. So 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 3 is in here

125
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:48,339
somewhere. Yeah, this just kind of has to be the 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's just clean it up.

126
00:25:54,170 --> 00:26:01,799
Any combinations here that I can do? I'm so mad that Jeremy plays this. This was my secret game.

127
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:09,049
Why are you mad that I enjoy a great, interesting, relaxing, fun game? Why does that make you mad?

128
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,799
I'm so mad that Jeremy likes this. This is my thing. This is my secret game.

129
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:38,490
I could get the 8 here. Let's see. Okay, so let's just say 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

130
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,980
That's definitely the 4. I mean, that would be very odd. That would be really odd if it was

131
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:53,460
like this. You know what I mean? 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. I don't believe that for a second. This is definitely

132
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:09,099
the 4. If I'm wrong, that's fine. I'll be wrong. The 1 is up here somewhere. So if this is the 8,

133
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:34,140
3 is 1. Let's just say 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It could be that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

134
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:52,579
8. But even if it's this, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It has to be right here. Right? You mean it's

135
00:27:52,579 --> 00:28:09,940
right? That's wrong. Wait, hold on. If this is the 4, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Hold on a second.

136
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:29,400
I hope this is correct. Otherwise, this whole thing's fucked up. This is probably a 1. 1, 2,

137
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:38,740
3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. It could be over here. I need to get rid of this shit first. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

138
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:47,160
Got more info to fill that. All right. Well, that's interesting because now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

139
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,920
You have to assume here now this is the 1 and there's a 3. There's 5. Let's just make it.

140
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,680
Let's make it nice and simple on ourselves here. I either blew it or I didn't. It's pretty simple.

141
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:12,650
You know what I mean? This is probably wrong. But who knows? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

142
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:20,519
I'm committing to have this being fucked up. We'll see. Yeah, it's all jacked up already.

143
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:33,740
Shit. No, I committed to it. I committed an initiative. Damn it. See how I screwed myself

144
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:47,849
here? This is the outlier right there. If that's the case, then this can't...

145
00:29:49,450 --> 00:30:02,549
That's not the 5. No, the 5, man. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's got to be a 1.

146
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,359
I blew it. It's all right. Sometimes you blow it. Damn it. I thought I had that one too.

147
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, this is 13. I like when they give you a nice easy one. 2, 4, 7. Yeah, not enough spaces.

148
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:49,369
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 2 somewhere up here. It all makes sense now. Thank you.

149
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:58,089
Now, wait a minute. This is... I can fill in a lot here because that's 15, 14, 13, 12.

150
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:07,180
Can I get at least... Let's just start with that. 10 is also... I can do a lot of these.

151
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:16,500
10, 10. Anything that's 10 can be filled in down to here and more than that. That was not a 10.

152
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:34,099
So this is a 10. Let's see. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3. Yoink. 1, 2, 3. Let's see. 9, 10, 11, 12.

153
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:52,519
Guess. Kim's Cookies. They're delicious. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 7, 8, 9. This is also part of the

154
00:31:52,519 --> 00:32:10,650
9. Then 9. Speaking of 9. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Okay. This is 6, 8. A lot of just big numbers

155
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:23,990
here. Well, there has to be a 2, so. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Space 2. There's the 2.

156
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:30,970
And then there it is. Let's hope that's correct. The 9. Part of the 2. There's the 2 again.

157
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:49,480
There's another 2. There's all the 3's. 1, 2, 3. Eh. Meh. 2, 3, 4, 5. That's gotta be

158
00:32:49,960 --> 00:33:00,700
right there. What about down here? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Can't do anything with this.

159
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:08,890
Anyone know if I read the recommendations channel on Discord? I do. I do all the time.

160
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:25,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I do read it frequently. How many more left here? 1, 2, 3,

161
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:39,670
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I can do this. This is done now. 1, 2, 3. Get it out of here.

162
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:55,980
Ah. 3. 1, 2, 3, 9. That's it. 5. I think I know what this is. What do I? It's weird that this

163
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:10,920
is here. It looks like a heart. 7. Done. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This is done. Close that up.

164
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,820
I mean, there's no way it's there. That's like symmetrical, right? It has to be there.

165
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:29,219
That's it for that 10. Yeah, this is pretty much a done deal right now. So we've got that done.

166
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:45,019
I think I can just fill these both in. Yeah. There's the 6. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what?

167
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:52,170
What kind of heart is this though? Is it just a heart? What's with the top left?

168
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:09,369
Just a heart. Guess. Elephant. I feel nice and slowed down. I do like another a couple more.

169
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:17,300
Let's do like a few more. This is another one of those slightly harder ones, I think. 13, 14, 15.

170
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:24,380
Right down the middle there. Breathe, breathe. Let's see. Is this probably 1411 anymore?

171
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:37,940
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. A few more hours? No, I'm probably going to skedaddle here

172
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:48,150
in a little bit. I just wanted to wind down a little. Let's see. 8. You're already guessing

173
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:55,690
animals? How are you already guessing this? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Nothing that's close to 15.

174
00:35:56,409 --> 00:36:26,300
That's the only thing I can do is this one here. I think I can do that, right? Yeah, I can. 3,

175
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:38,550
2. No, this is definitely part of the 3. This is the 2, right? Yeah. Which then that makes this

176
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:53,380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is a 1. Part of the 8. Interesting. This game makes me irrationally angry.

177
00:36:54,099 --> 00:37:02,070
I don't think that should be happening. I don't think that should be happening. I think you need

178
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:07,190
to calm down a little. I could probably pull this tooth out if I tried hard enough. Don't pull your

179
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:29,269
teeth out. Do not pull out your teeth, please. 2, 1. This is part of 3. This might be a 1.

180
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:42,440
If this is 1. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 1, 2. Okay. 1, 2,

181
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,440
3, 4. 1, 1. This could be the 4 here, although it's unlikely what it could be.

182
00:37:49,639 --> 00:38:05,340
I'm gonna do it. Give me the pliers. No, sit down. Stop it. Give me the pliers.

183
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:36,809
Shit. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I don't know. I'm stuck. 7, 8, 9, 10. I'm stuck right now. 1, 2.

184
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:53,429
1, 2. Help me out here, guys. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

185
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:15,449
I think I can get this. All right. I can get that. 2, 3. This is 3. 3, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

186
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:30,900
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. This could be the 1. 1, and then 1, 2, 3. No, 1. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3. No,

187
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:40,659
it's not. This is definitely the 2. That one may cry 5 waiting room. We're not doing that tonight.

188
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:53,750
It sounds like I'm trying to count to 10, but I can't do it. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. I don't know.

189
00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:13,159
Well, I can do something here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Something on the other side. 1, 2, 3, 4. 6, 7.

190
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,079
Holy shit, this is part of the 4. Really? 1, 2, 3, 4. Oh, I don't know. It could be any one of

191
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:42,099
those numbers after 8. This changes this up a little. So 6 is now able to be done a little

192
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:56,820
bit here. It's 8. Something like that. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. This is just counting. Yeah,

193
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:03,539
that freed up some space with 8 because look at this. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Look at

194
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:09,929
this. Okay, I'm just going to do it. I'm going to punch myself as hard as I can in the face.

195
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:32,329
Okay, this is meant to calm you down. That's right. It's supposed to just be chilling and

196
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:40,550
just shutting up and playing. I forgot. 1, 2, 3. Okay, I can get rid of this.

197
00:41:43,880 --> 00:42:05,219
Doesn't help me for anything else though. Okay, that helps this though because if this is 3, then

198
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:14,969
I just figured that out. Smart guy. The question is, is this the 3? I don't know.

199
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:23,500
If this might be the 3, I think it is. I'm just going to say this. Now I can do the 4. 1, 2, 3.

200
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:33,820
Space. This has to be the 3 going up. Boing, boing. Please be right. I think it is.

201
00:42:44,519 --> 00:43:06,070
It's a head scratcher at this point. 5, 2, 5, 6, 7. Can't do anything with that.

202
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:20,679
This 8 though. No. Remember to go to church this Sunday? If that's what you do, then yeah.

203
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,980
This is definitely part of that. That's it. Let's close that out of here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

204
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:56,630
8. Can I get 3 on both sides? I can. Nice. Yes. Oh, it feels great. 5, 3. This is awkward here.

205
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:08,739
So 1, 4, right? It's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 1. That's part of the 4. So that's the first

206
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:26,389
1. Okay, that looks good. There's the second 2. Okay, what else we got here?

207
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:40,150
Done. And then that makes... He's guessing? No, I don't know. That 4 had to be right there,

208
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,510
and then the ones had to place this way, and that gave me the 2, and that gave me the 4.

209
00:44:44,389 --> 00:45:03,239
I'm not guessing on this one. 2, 1. That's definitely 1. That's also 1. Oh, fuck. Wait. Oh,

210
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:20,730
no. 3, 3. Whoa. I blew it. Oh, it was going so well. Oh, what did I do? I really wasn't

211
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:36,820
guessing though. This is not correct here. No. This is correct. I'm certain of that, but not here.

212
00:45:39,619 --> 00:46:10,840
But there's no way this is correct. That's the 8, right? This is the 3. That's the only 3.

213
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:30,780
On this side at least, right? All right. Got it. Just uninstall it. No, wait. What do you mean? No.

214
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:55,429
No? Are you sure? Because that looks pretty close. That would make complete sense. Because before

215
00:46:55,429 --> 00:47:08,019
I had it back here. Oh, wait. No, but what the fuck is going on here? Oh, no. Oh, this is the

216
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:14,820
worst when you... Oh, god damn it. No. The right 3 crosses, I guess? No, I didn't. I just... Because

217
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:47,079
this was empty. And I figured it had to be the 4. And it... Shit. No. No, this is supposed to

218
00:47:47,079 --> 00:48:26,820
be making me happy. Let me see if I can fix this shit. How can I sleep with this pick-ross fail?

219
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:34,440
Well, there's no way it's these. Because this 4 can't fit in here. No, it's not down here either.

220
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:46,039
I might be too tired for this. And I do this while I'm tired. Oh, no. No, I had it too.

221
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,280
It's the same shit I was saying when I played Sekiro. No, no, I had it. I gotta restart. I gotta

222
00:48:52,280 --> 00:49:11,320
redo it again from the beginning. Oh, fuck. I had it. This is correct. It is. Don't tell me it's

223
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:44,980
not. I know it is. It's wrong. Is this... This whole row can't... This can't be incorrect.

224
00:49:47,719 --> 00:50:05,190
And looks like is... Is that what was just fucking me this whole time? No, but this is fucking wrong

225
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:17,380
though. You see, like 4, 1, 1 can't be here. It's... Something else is wrong. See what I'm saying?

226
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:37,449
Like, I think this whole thing is fucked up. Because this is supposed to be 2, 1, which...

227
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:50,650
Like, that's 2, 1, but... But then this 6, right? Like, there's no... How am I gonna get the 6 in

228
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:59,539
here? You know what I'm saying? There's no way. The 6 is not gonna fit in here. This whole thing is...

229
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:14,230
What is this? What nice animal. 3... Because look, see? Nope. Nope. This is 1. This is the only place

230
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:39,340
where it can start. 5 and then 2. 2 is already done here. This one's done. Or no, at least like

231
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:48,869
this part is. That's the 3, 5, 2. Where's the 1 go? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. See what's going on here?

232
00:51:49,670 --> 00:52:43,960
This is all messed up. Look at this. We're gonna get a bigger problem down here. No. No.

233
00:52:43,960 --> 00:53:06,179
Fuck. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I need one more. 6. But then this is fucking wrong. All these 5, these 2, 2,

234
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:10,019
2, 2. I got... This is all... I screwed up something like a couple times and it's just over.

235
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:21,429
Is it... I don't think there's something I can replace here to make this right.

236
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:29,539
Because the 13 has to... The 13 has to be here. You understand? The 5 is wrong then.

237
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:34,650
Because this has to be here. And then all this shit is wrong.

238
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:28,409
Get me out of here. Fuck it. Harder than Sekiro. I fucked it up. God damn it. I'm going to bed.

239
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:40,070
God damn it. I had it too. I was gonna relax. Yeah, this is relaxing me. My 40% capacity

240
00:54:40,070 --> 00:55:12,389
brainpower right now is doing great. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Not enough to get a whole row.

241
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:33,210
I need to calm down from this stressful de-stress. Yeah. Hey, calm down and go play some Sekiro.

242
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,219
I actually probably should have just gone... I should have probably just ended the stream

243
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:55,880
an hour ago when I was already tired enough to go to bed. All right, let's see. 5 and then 1, 2,

244
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:16,179
3. That's... This is 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4. No, 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay, that would... That makes sense.

245
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:36,420
He doesn't know how to count again. He's losing his mind. He beats Sekiro. Can't beat Picross.

246
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:52,099
No, I can. I can do it. I'm gonna like just go hold my head under water and then the bath

247
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:55,139
and like the bathtub that... No, no, no. Listen, listen. Like I'm talking about like

248
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:03,349
go take a bath. Go take a bath. Listen. I'm gonna go take a bath and just like relax and like put

249
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:06,949
my head under and then get the warmth and then come back out. You didn't let me finish.

250
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:15,929
That's not how you bathe. Yes, you do. You go back and like go under just for like two seconds

251
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:32,199
and then come out and you're... You baptize yourself. All right, we've got 8. So obviously

252
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:40,469
8 has to be here. So we got 1, 2, 3. Let's see. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Pretty good.

253
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:50,219
That would make sense here. And then the 2 is down here somewhere because that's correct. Yeah,

254
00:57:50,219 --> 00:58:05,349
it is. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. 5, 5. Let's see. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

255
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:28,809
I can... It's probably the same thing. It's baptized. Yeah, I'm gonna go baptize myself

256
00:58:28,809 --> 00:59:08,059
in like the warm cooling waters of the bathtub. Yeah, it's the cooling waters of the bath.

257
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:23,260
This is 4. In fact, I might just fucking flip the table over here in Monopoly and just go do it now.

258
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:47,179
I went into like the 15 by 15 P-Cross. Should have just did like the 10 by 10. Let me see.

259
00:59:50,889 --> 01:00:15,719
3, 1. Do a 50 by 51 in a bath. I think... I honestly think Ishin might have dropped my IQ by like

260
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:33,860
8 points. I mean that permanently. To beat Sekiro, I had to drop my IQ by 10 points.

261
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:40,150
I used it all. You know how you have like... Okay, I used some life consumables.

262
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:46,550
Take 10 years or 10 points of IQ off life but gain 30 straight seconds of utter complete focus.

263
01:00:46,550 --> 01:01:04,469
I used it. Perishables. He's activated checks too many times. Again, you guys know

264
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:10,150
in like fucking time travel movies and tv shows where they like their nose is bleeding and they

265
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:16,230
keep using the time travel and eventually they like they they go fucking like wacky. They've

266
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:21,800
lost their mind because they've done it too many times. I think I may have activated checks too

267
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:58,070
many times. This happens in click. Have fun. I'm gonna just relax. I use my back and time powers

268
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:10,809
too much. If you guys do this, I'll do another Minecraft VR stream. You have uh you have five

269
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:32,900
minutes. I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard. You have until uh 11 um you can't cheat

270
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:54,059
either. Yeah, I'm sorry. I've I got no brain power left. It's gone. I'm gonna admit when I,

271
01:02:54,059 --> 01:03:07,300
you know, when I'm just gonna admit defeat when I have to. All of it's gone. Jeremy lied about

272
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:12,730
Minecraft VR. Five more community subs. You've been insane tonight with these community subs.

273
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:26,519
Thank you. You guys have to let's see eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen. I'll give you guys

274
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:42,760
until 15 minutes. No cheating. You have until the clock on the top right strikes 15. Restart the

275
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:57,179
board. That's not part of the deal. We ain't got no damn idea. No, some of you guys know what's

276
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:13,610
going on. Restart the board, fucker. Fine. Fine. I'll give that to you. But you just consumed uh

277
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:19,289
two of your brain cell minutes. So now you have five minutes to do it. You used your power.

278
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:48,710
Don't use it too many times. Alright, fine. You got until seven minutes. I'll give it back.

279
01:04:49,530 --> 01:05:02,699
I cleared the board. You have seven minutes and then the stream's over. I gotta go take a break.

280
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:11,480
I gotta go take a shower. Eat some food. Good luck though guys. I really hope you hope you get it.

281
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:24,340
I promised Minecraft. Yeah, if you guys if you guys do this by the time it's seven minutes,

282
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:33,130
I will do another episode of Germacraft VR. I said seven minutes. I did make it six minutes.

283
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:53,289
I just gave you an extra minute. I'm not lying. Do it. Keep me honest. That's the thing. The 15

284
01:05:53,289 --> 01:06:01,420
by 15s are like some some of them are very difficult. Most pit cross puzzles top out

285
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:08,300
at around 15 by 20, 20 by 20, 25 by 25 is really kind of pushing it for difficulty.

286
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:16,059
There are a lot, there are some pit cross puzzles that go more than 25 by 25 or 20 by 20 but they're

287
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:21,739
it's like doing a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle. At some point you're just like,

288
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:28,679
eh, I kind of wanted to do a quick one. 30 by 30s, yeah. They take a while though. They can take

289
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:38,920
upwards of like an hour. Especially some of the ones that are more than 30 to 40 or 40 by 40.

290
01:06:39,559 --> 01:07:01,670
What are you all even trying to do? They're trying to make a full square and they do it every time.

291
01:07:03,639 --> 01:07:21,110
40 by 40 is 1600 pieces. It's a lot, yeah. Takes a while. Is it 1600? No, it's not. Is it? How many

292
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:39,219
are here in 15 by 15? You guys have plenty of time to get this fixed but for those of you that are

293
01:07:39,219 --> 01:07:42,659
sticking around, that's the end of the stream. Sekiro was really the only thing I wanted to

294
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:54,219
finish tonight. Yeah, it is 1600, yeah. You will see me again. We're gonna play Monster Rancher.

295
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:58,760
We're gonna start with Monster Rancher 4 and if it sucks we're gonna go back to Monster Rancher 2.

296
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,659
All the Sekiro people already left, yeah. I know. Thanks for sticking around, you guys.

297
01:08:04,659 --> 01:08:17,720
Just sticking around in pit cross and watching me have another meltdown. Meltdown 2. Give us until

298
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:25,260
you finish reading bits. Okay, that's not like a fair assessment here. Let's see, how many bits

299
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:41,979
do we have? Okay, no, that's fair. I wish you luck. So, my journal lied about Minecraft VR. Five more

300
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:54,729
community subs. My god, thank you so much. So many community subs. Super seal, thanks for the 250.

301
01:08:54,729 --> 01:08:59,210
Just letting you know there's going to be a temporary TF2 man versus machine update.

302
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:08,260
What do you mean temporary? Operation memes versus machines. Oh, nah.

303
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,659
All right, just the title alone is kind of like,

304
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:21,369
I don't know about that. That's on the official Team Fortress post, yeah. Memes versus machines.

305
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:32,409
Might be interesting, but maybe not. Who knows. But thank you super seal for the heads up there.

306
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:36,329
Sad Vega, thanks for the 250. Oh my god, Jeremy, you missed so much shit. No joke, you're gonna

307
01:09:36,329 --> 01:09:40,090
have to play the whole game again. You should do as much as you can before you get to Junichiro

308
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:46,810
and fight him. Also, could you kill those poor castle grandmas? I did that parent

309
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:53,399
and didn't hurt a single one. I did that parent and didn't hurt a single one. They just cry

310
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:58,760
and curl into a ball if you look at them. You horrible monster. I feel like I did,

311
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:04,010
I missed a lot of shit, but yeah, but aren't there two or three different ways you can go through

312
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:11,079
the game? I was under the assumption that some of the choices I was making changed the whole game.

313
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:18,279
And you can't really go back and redo them, right? There's four, there's four endings.

314
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:30,069
And on a first playthrough, it's, you know, kind of just need to do it, you know. But thank you,

315
01:10:30,069 --> 01:10:34,710
Sad Vega. Hole of one zombie, thanks for the five dolls. Kind of odd, but just wanted to say thanks

316
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,789
for reading my dumb comments. Before I watched your streams, I used to think up stupid shit to

317
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:44,729
make my friend laugh, but he passed from cancer. Your streams helped me laugh again and want to

318
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:49,289
make you laugh too, if that makes sense. Kind of depressing, but keep making people laugh.

319
01:10:52,069 --> 01:11:04,680
I'm really, really fucking sorry to hear that. Making people laugh, telling jokes, and enjoying

320
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:11,210
experiences with people is one of my favorite things in the world. Having fun together is

321
01:11:12,329 --> 01:11:21,979
my favorite thing on earth. I'm really, really terribly sorry to hear about that hole of one

322
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:38,010
zombie. I'm happy that you can hang out here and make jokes and give some joy to other people.

323
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:59,029
Thank you so much for the five dolls. How are you guys doing? Yeah, actually, I'm really doing

324
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:08,890
that bad. You're starting to get it. A Frodeon weapon, thanks to the five dolls, Frodeon. Superb

325
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:19,460
shinobi execution, term of checks. I think that was for the demon of hatred, but thank you,

326
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,899
Frodeon. And then say 250 from Frodeon again. You're doing a great job.

327
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:33,239
I'm trying, I'm trying. Sekiro was fun. Did you beat the final boss? Yes, I completed Sekiro.

328
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:38,500
It is done. Something or other, thanks to the 250. Hey Jerm, saw you at the bowling alley the

329
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,100
other day trying to get the bowling shoes over your regular clown shoes. I noticed that you

330
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,180
wouldn't, I noticed that you would let out a high-pitched scream whenever someone tried to

331
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:51,539
help, so I figured I'd offer a piece of advice now that I'm not with an earshot. Why not put the

332
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:56,739
bowling shoes on first, then put the clown shoes on over them, since the clown shoes are bigger?

333
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:03,079
Smiley face. That's a good tip. That's a really good tip. I'll probably check, I'll probably do

334
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:14,170
that next time in this imaginary scenario that you made up. $50, I missed this earlier. I was

335
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:19,529
really, really focused and intense and I missed a $50 donation. I don't know if you still hear fudge

336
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:27,270
44. It was 5,000 bits. I'm really sorry I didn't catch this when it first came through,

337
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,680
but I'm not sure if you still hear. Maybe not. I suppose it was about four hours ago, so

338
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:39,159
thank you regardless. They say, hey Jerm, I stumbled across your channel years ago when

339
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:47,640
you were playing Battlefield 3 with Pwnstar and have been a fan since. Now that is a long time ago.

340
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:51,590
Just want to say thanks for getting me into TF2 and volunteering at an elementary school.

341
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:56,470
Got inspired by your video on working at an animal shelter. About to finish university

342
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:00,390
and recently got my first job, so finally have the money to show my appreciation for all the

343
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:05,640
entertainment advice. Sorry it's taken so long for me to give something back. You already gave

344
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:14,340
something back by watching. The amount of people that watch these streams, collectively all of you,

345
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:19,270
have given me more than anything I could ever ask for in my life. Everything I've ever dreamed of.

346
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:29,420
Doing entertainment. Doing jokes and comedy and bits. That's the number one thing I've wanted in

347
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:37,460
my entire life and you've given it to me. That's worth way more than money. Thank you.

348
01:14:44,729 --> 01:14:55,430
You guys just filled row A. Well you got a little bit more time. Hanging out and doing

349
01:14:55,430 --> 01:15:00,819
broadcasting and doing videos and shit. Something I've always wanted to do. Thank you for letting

350
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:09,020
me fulfill my the goal of my whole entire existence. It's worth way more than a dollar.

351
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:17,939
Thank you. And when I say dollar I don't mean a dollar that you get 50. I'm talking about just

352
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:28,069
like the dollar. Thank you so much. Penguin thanks for the five dollars penguin. I would help you

353
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:36,470
Jerma but I have... this is like a thing with the streamer says the thing right? No is this? I don't

354
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:53,350
know. Lumbago? What is that? I've heard it. I would help you Jerma but I have Lumbago. Who says that?

355
01:15:53,430 --> 01:16:06,310
Somebody says that. Oh it's from Red Dead. Right. I thought it was like the the other one.

356
01:16:06,869 --> 01:16:09,829
Flank tank. Thanks for the three bucks flank tank. Are there going to be new emotes anytime

357
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:15,420
soon if you have any open slots or maybe a community emote vote part two? Yeah,

358
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:22,619
Sakura really has just taken up 100% of my time here. I haven't really had an opportunity and

359
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:29,020
I'm sick too. I spent a couple days last week sick so I haven't really been focusing on it

360
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:37,640
but yes there's gonna be a lot of new shit soon. Soon soon soon. But thank you flank tank.

361
01:16:40,859 --> 01:16:48,699
D Jack thanks for the 250. Well done Sekiro. Well done. I got through it. Tingy thanks for the 250.

362
01:16:48,699 --> 01:16:56,229
Is this the guy who beat Sekiro on stream? It is not. As of the end of this broadcast, yes it is.

363
01:16:56,229 --> 01:17:05,939
It is not. We get to say that now. Thank you Tingy. Thank you Have Gun for the 250. I was there when

364
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:22,420
Jerma defeated grandpa and became his own man. You guys again with the A. Some people just want

365
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:31,260
to watch the world burn. That's the scenario there. Smelly Boy thanks for the 250. I hate that clip

366
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:43,779
it. I wonder what you were referring to. But thank you Iron Dude for the five dollars. Congrats Jerma.

367
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:51,699
Thank you. Thank you so much for the five dollars Iron Dude. Clueless Sniper thanks for 250. Hey

368
01:17:51,699 --> 01:18:05,210
Jerma now that you've beaten Sekiro what are your favorite from bosses? Ludwig is number one

369
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:11,289
always. I don't think any boss in this game topped how I felt when I played Ludwig for the first time.

370
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:20,550
The fountainhead dragon was really really awesome. Scale wise probably the biggest boss they've done

371
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:27,560
which was just awesome to see. Really really interesting design. That's probably the up there

372
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:38,329
for like coolest looking and most interesting art direction wise. I'm trying to think if I would put

373
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:46,789
any I'm trying to think of before. It's hard to remember like every boss from the whole this

374
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:57,590
like 150 bosses across this whole company's lineup here. Who's my favorite? Let me just think about

375
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:03,619
my favorite bosses from the whole series in general. Dark Souls one. My favorite boss from

376
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:12,920
Dark Souls or my favorite boss from Demon's Souls was probably the last fight. That was a lot of fun.

377
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:18,979
Fighting against the guy with the sword that dashed around and he was really really cool.

378
01:19:18,979 --> 01:19:31,850
I forget what his name was. I think in Sekiro the first fight against Genichiro was maybe my

379
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:44,390
favorite. Now that I have a chance to sit here and think about it. No no no not the not the

380
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:48,310
tutorial one. I'm talking about like the first when you beat him then he like falls over the

381
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:56,069
balcony. Just that fight was just really really fun. It felt very fluid. Old King Alant is that

382
01:19:56,069 --> 01:20:05,659
boss from Demon's Souls. Yeah that was definitely one of my favorites. Dark Souls two. I feel like

383
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:14,439
there was a boss every 30 minutes in Dark Souls two so it's hard to remember. Who was my favorite

384
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:35,079
boss from Dark Souls two? I don't know. Maybe not necessarily favorite fight but the guy that the

385
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:39,560
two people that were back to back that were connected that would fold on top of each other

386
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:45,159
and you'd fight one and then they would do like a little cartwheel. I don't know if I liked that

387
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:53,979
fight but I liked that how that boss looked. They had the two scimitars. The sentry yeah.

388
01:20:55,420 --> 01:21:06,010
That was just a really interesting mechanic in regards to just how it looks and how cool it was.

389
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:21,350
Dark Souls three is uh honestly probably Pontiff. I just love his animations. They're so cool.

390
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:33,819
He was just so fun to watch. His the two blades that he has were just and oh no Gale. Gale was

391
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:37,979
unbelievable. That oh man that's tricky. That might be one of my favorite. That's my favorite

392
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:50,140
fight like ever huh. Gale yeah Gale Ludwig I think are still higher than anything from Sekiro for me.

393
01:21:56,890 --> 01:22:05,270
Sekiro was more about fighting other people for the most part. There wasn't there was a couple of

394
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:10,149
extravagant ridiculous enemies but for the most part the major enemies in Sekiro are

395
01:22:10,869 --> 01:22:17,060
I'm also a guy and I've got a sword too. So it's hard to make the comparison between like Gale

396
01:22:17,939 --> 01:22:30,090
or Ludwig versus something like Owl. It's kind of just your dad. Fight wise they were brilliant

397
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:38,180
but I guess it's it's hard to overcome the way that I felt when when you get to phase three of

398
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:46,470
Gale. It's just it's so everything it just clicks everything looks so interesting.

399
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:51,670
He has a really really cool move set. I don't know it would be tough between Gale and uh

400
01:22:51,670 --> 01:23:07,050
and Ludwig. They're all good. Most of the Sekiro bosses were dudes with swords. Kind of had to be

401
01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:13,369
like that though because in a game that's based around parrying deflecting and you know posture

402
01:23:13,369 --> 01:23:19,100
and sword play you did they really then they tried you know they came like the ape the giant

403
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:26,500
ape was sword and he was stabbing and they did do a good job with that but you kind of have to

404
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:44,579
have it be a game about sword play and then you move on to Bloodborne and Bloodborne is just

405
01:23:44,579 --> 01:23:52,859
is a perfect video game. There's so many bosses. I have such fond memories of a shitload of those

406
01:23:52,859 --> 01:24:02,460
bosses. The research facility is one of my favorite zones in any video game. Drip drop drip drop like

407
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:08,579
that place was fucking crazy. I loved that place. I wish I could just play Bloodborne 2.

408
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:25,539
The DLC in Bloodborne was the best DLC that From Software has ever made. Regardless of a copy and

409
01:24:25,539 --> 01:24:32,710
paste couple of boss fights the DLC was the best they've done ever. It was perfect. Well not perfect

410
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:40,760
because I just told you that they you know this they copy pasted a boss or two. We'll see if they

411
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:45,000
come up with some DLC for this game because they've been pretty on point with it so far the last like

412
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:53,779
five years. Lady Maria was just absolutely phenomenal. Ludwig absolutely fucking phenomenal.

413
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:08,390
Yeah I want to like go back and play it again. Orphan was next level almost like the yeah what

414
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:21,380
a great game. I still hold it to a higher regard than Sekiro. Sekiro is pretty close though. I

415
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:29,130
think Sekiro is better than Dark Souls 3 just as an entire the whole package. It's tough.

416
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:36,539
Ah the memories. But hopefully that answers your question.

417
01:25:38,069 --> 01:25:42,710
Sad Vega thanks for the 250. Congratulations on getting the bad end. I hope you do better next

418
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:53,850
time. Oh man wait till you see the actual final boss. Congratulations on the bad end. Nioh is

419
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:59,609
better than all of them. I just okay I'm gonna be here's a confession here. Yes I play oh dude

420
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:07,159
go back to Nioh. You know you were just like shitfaced. You would like it. Offstream I like

421
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:18,489
a year ago or so I did try to just play Nioh off stream. I just I didn't like it. I was I just

422
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:32,260
didn't it didn't click. I don't know what it was about it. The gameplay is fun. The environment's

423
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:41,399
interesting. I just something about it was not clicking with me. Nioh looks lame compared to

424
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:50,869
Sekiro. They had a really uh the way your character moved around is I think what I had the biggest

425
01:26:50,869 --> 01:26:59,319
problem with in Nioh. Like the way that the dodges worked and it was just it felt very

426
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:17,100
um it's hard to describe. You guys did it. Look you made a bow and arrow. But thank you sad

427
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,819
mega. Thank you Dubski dude for the 250. You are a gaming god. My heart was pounding during that

428
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:26,380
last stretch. Didn't think you were gonna make it. Neither did I. This game wasn't made for human

429
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:30,380
beings but you beat it. Have my bit so I can finally say that I gave a sweaty internet goblin

430
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:38,149
a hundred dollars in total. You deserve it. Thank you. Thank you Dubski dude. I didn't think I was

431
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:52,810
gonna make it either. I had so much self-doubt going into half of those attempts. 52 attempts.

432
01:27:53,750 --> 01:28:01,079
Dear god. I guarantee I can tell you how like 38 of them went. Oh my god.

433
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:07,960
Fuck no. Just redo it. Ready? Let's let's turn let's turn the audio off. I want you to like

434
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:15,720
maybe somebody like just super they can pose me over. Ready? Here is absolutely at least

435
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:28,859
15 to 20 of those attempts. Now I'm just gonna go. I'm gonna try it. Okay. Fucking god damn it.

436
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:39,180
It's just fucking insane. It's it's just insane. I don't want to do this part. Oh my fucking god.

437
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:46,789
Jesus christ. Always hits me with that bullshit. Yeah that's a good one. Always hits me with that

438
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:57,909
bullshit. I forgot about that one. What a stupid fucking mechanic. Honestly why? Why? I'm so close

439
01:28:57,909 --> 01:29:14,409
to the wall. There's nothing I could even do. Someone just said I came I just came back. What?

440
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:36,069
But impose me. Ready? Oh my god. No. No. No. Fucking my god. Oh my fucking god.

441
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:43,000
Give me a fucking break. I probably said that four or five hundred times in the last three hours of

442
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:54,220
the stream. He's raging at stuff that doesn't exist in Picross. Is this guy like on fucking drugs?

443
01:29:59,939 --> 01:30:04,819
Hey PikaBanana thanks for 30 bucks. 30 dollars from PikaBanana. Congrats Jerma. I'm so glad I

444
01:30:04,819 --> 01:30:09,850
could watch you beat the game live. It was so much fun to watch. Thanks for sticking around. Thanks

445
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:16,310
for hanging out. I know some of these new games that have a lot of hype behind them. A lot of

446
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:20,149
people maybe don't want to see just because they're playing on planet themselves. So those of you that

447
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:25,130
have really stuck around the whole time. I hope you enjoyed it. Thanks for hanging out the whole

448
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:30,170
time. Well for you know however long you were here. Thank you for the 30 dollars PikaBanana.

449
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:34,630
Appreciate it. Zero giblets thanks for three bucks. You did great Jerma. Thanks for the stream. I have

450
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:40,300
to ask what is your new scale of favorites for from games? You mentioned favorite bosses. Thanks

451
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:54,220
again. You ready? Here we go. Dark Souls 2 at the bottom. But this is going up right? I would say

452
01:30:54,220 --> 01:31:06,779
Dark Souls 2. I'm not gonna make a lot of people upset about with this but Dark Souls 2. Dark

453
01:31:06,779 --> 01:31:22,630
Souls 1. No no no no. Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1. Sekiro. Demon's Souls. Bloodborne.

454
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:45,350
There you go. Done. In that like order going up. I loved that. I love Demon's Souls. Yeah Demon's

455
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:57,340
Souls is that high. I just I loved it. Do it again but this time coherent. Okay Dark Souls 2.

456
01:32:00,939 --> 01:32:09,770
Then Dark Souls 3. Dark Souls 1. Sekiro. Demon's Souls. Bloodborne. The thing about

457
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:17,850
you could probably. Sekiro could probably overtake Demon's Souls. I mean I just did play

458
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:31,380
Demon's Souls. I mean I did. Well actually I did like last year. Here look. Oh here you go. I'll

459
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:55,289
write it out. Here we go. I'll hear you. Official. I would probably say Demon's Souls and Sekiro

460
01:32:55,289 --> 01:33:25,500
probably equal for me right now. What am I lagging for? Okay here we go. Ready? He's typing really

461
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:39,319
slow. You guys didn't even come close. Let me see. 29 minutes and this is shit you guys have.

462
01:33:41,939 --> 01:33:47,640
There you go. I fixed it. 30 minutes are gone. That's it. Guess what? I'll give you a consolation

463
01:33:47,640 --> 01:34:15,579
prize. I'll play Minecraft VR again. Not as long this time. Oh no you know I'll watch a Minecraft

464
01:34:15,579 --> 01:34:32,680
video. I'll watch a Minecraft related video. Today? No not today. Thank you Tingy for the 250.

465
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,439
Congrats on beating the game. Now it's time for your death count. Drum roll please. German95 you

466
01:34:36,439 --> 01:34:46,619
had 221 deaths throughout all the streams. Jess you got it and I've kept count. And there you go.

467
01:34:46,619 --> 01:34:57,819
Look at this. Let's see how. Wow what happened on March 26th? Honest to god look at that. I was on

468
01:34:57,819 --> 01:35:06,520
point on the 26th apparently. I must have had my fucking vitamins. What was what what bosses what

469
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:18,619
areas were the 26th? Was it the ape? I would expect that would be way less. I mean way more.

470
01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:29,590
That's cool though. 63 52 of them were the final boss. German lied about Minecraft VR. Another

471
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:35,850
five community subs. You are uh what are you at now? 115 total in the channel. You've given 115

472
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:46,789
community subs. Thank you German lied about Minecraft VR. That's a lot. But thank you Tingy

473
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:55,579
for the 250 and for keeping track. You and Jess you got it. It's cool to see it. D Jack thanks for

474
01:35:55,579 --> 01:36:02,310
the 250. So quick first impression. The game's not even fun. It's like the least amount of fun

475
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:14,420
I've ever had. Thank you though. Thank you Wavelet for the four dollars and 20 cents. Congrats on

476
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:18,260
beating the game. German the last boss fight. Stage three with no healing pots or Rez's left was

477
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:39,779
intense. Pog. Yeah oh I'm just I'm just remembering that fight. It's a lot. It's a lot of fun. Thank

478
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:48,890
you snooze and copter for the 250. Uh have I seen this video? This video. Yeah this is this is the

479
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:55,579
German Defoe one with the painting. You know some people say it looks like me. Yeah I watched it on

480
01:36:55,579 --> 01:37:03,130
stream before here. We have seen this one. And then they said uh I was curious how you and Kim met.

481
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:15,979
How did you get to know each other? Uh we met at a Christmas party and then I we just started

482
01:37:15,979 --> 01:37:24,899
texting. We like we hooked up at the Christmas party right. So it was already kind of like oh

483
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:31,380
okay like I will talk again. We started texting back and forth and then it was like hey come over

484
01:37:31,699 --> 01:37:46,819
you want to come over? Yeah we watched like fucking Iron Chef for three hours and that was it. Boring

some secrets on how to get food network shows. Iron Chef. Hell's Kitchen. Kitchen Nightmares.

488
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:24,649
There is no better thing to watch when you're on a date. You want to know why? Because it never

489
01:38:24,649 --> 01:38:30,300
fucking ends and you don't you don't have to think of the awkward moment where oh let's watch this

490
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:36,949
movie. An hour and 30 minutes went by it's over. Oh fuck now what the hell am I gonna do? What the

491
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:45,109
hell are we gonna talk about? There's like 6,000 episodes of Iron Chef across regions of the earth.

492
01:38:45,109 --> 01:38:50,149
There's like 2,000 Japanese episodes and then they ported it to America and there's like 3,000

493
01:38:50,149 --> 01:38:55,350
American episodes. You can just leave it on and just figure out what you're gonna how you're gonna

494
01:38:55,350 --> 01:39:05,500
what you're gonna do. Well then she'll go I gotta go now it's getting late. Yeah but like you you

495
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,859
had you have so many opportunities to like talk and it's not just like the the movie ends or the

496
01:39:10,859 --> 01:39:17,510
tv show ends. Everybody expects when you look when you go into it you turn on Iron Chef you're not

497
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:23,109
just gonna watch one episode. That's not how it works. You're gonna watch at least eight otherwise

498
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:34,489
you're not gonna watch it at all. So you know you know what you're getting into. Nobody goes

499
01:39:34,489 --> 01:39:41,819
hey yeah like Iron Chef oh yeah that sounds like a cool idea one episode done. That's I'm done. No

500
01:39:41,819 --> 01:39:50,680
it would be weird if you were to turn that off after two episodes telling you Iron Chef. And

501
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:54,520
there's plenty to talk about there's so many interesting things and food and and wow he

502
01:39:54,520 --> 01:40:00,520
burnt the chicken oh my god he burnt hey Kim he burnt the chicken can you believe it? No I can't

503
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:05,399
he burnt I know it's unbelievable. He's gonna get points deducted from that you can't do that during

504
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:14,500
a movie. Try doing that during a movie. He just got shot in the chest Kim he got shot in the chest

505
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:19,460
Kim yeah he got shot yeah oh he just like John Wick just punched that guy did you see John Wick

506
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:24,100
yeah John Wick just like threw him across the bridge yeah. No you're gonna sit there quiet

507
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:33,300
awkward and silent. You can do full-on commentary during a Food Network show. This is an NPC

508
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:49,829
conversation. That's my biggest relationship tip Iron Chef that's all I gotta say. Hey we've got

509
01:40:49,829 --> 01:40:54,470
your earlier rigid parallel thanks for the five dolls yeah the one that has 21 hours in

510
01:40:54,470 --> 01:41:02,250
PictoPix is a fantastic little game there's so many different versions. Jerma goes on dates and

511
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:09,079
talks like an oblivion NPC. No I'll just give an example and look my brain is tired so they're

512
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:17,850
gonna be very very basic simple examples. All right we're almost done. Thank you to Garfield

513
01:41:17,850 --> 01:41:22,329
the Monday Killer for the 250. Been a while since I've made a comic for you. Let's get this on here

514
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:28,470
There's more stuff. Been a while since I made a comic for you Jerma the Worm. I had a dream the

515
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:34,390
mammoth from Ice Age was trying to kill me inside an insane asylum. First of all don't eat before

516
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:38,310
you go to bed because that's why that happened. The only way out was to grab an egg spinning on

517
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:46,149
a metal saw blade. Have you ever had a dream like that? Ever had deja vu before? Hey I'm Garf I'm

518
01:41:46,149 --> 01:41:50,949
not so Garf and where are the game Garfs? Yeah Jerma you said that yesterday you're losing your

519
01:41:50,949 --> 01:41:58,569
marbles man. Odie called the doctor I don't think Jerma's feeling. Stop you violated the law you

520
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:10,420
burnt the chicken. I burnt the chicken you burnt the chicken. God damn it. Yeah don't eat like

521
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:14,180
fucking three slices of pepperoni pizza before you go to bed that's why you're having weird dreams.

522
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:35,109
I'm serious look it up. I just did that. Don't. I'm gonna do that now why? No don't eat eating

523
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:43,779
right before bed fucks with you. It does. Yes somebody just said it. But thank you Garfield

524
01:42:43,779 --> 01:42:50,859
for the 250. Thank you Garfield the Monday killer. Bingo Sunshine thanks for the five bucks. The AI

525
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:57,340
the AL is a boring mess this year. Do you think the Brewers can win the most competitive division

526
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:04,470
in baseball and take it all? Fuck the Pats lol. Red Sox are gonna win again. The Red Sox are gonna

527
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:21,689
win 154 games. Hey Mast Herman thanks for the 10 dollars. Thank you so much. I've been hoping to

528
01:43:21,689 --> 01:43:29,880
show you the movie I made inspired by Rat Movie. Oh it's Mast Hero Man not Mast Herman like the

529
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:42,409
Pee Wee Herman superhero. I'm sorry. There's no capitals on Streamlabs. I've tried to explain

530
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:50,010
this before but there are no capitals on Streamlabs so you M the H and the M they're

531
01:43:50,010 --> 01:44:01,609
they're not capitalized so it's Mast Herman. I'm sorry. Yeah by the way why the fuck is there are

532
01:44:01,609 --> 01:44:09,699
there no capitals on Streamlabs? I have no idea why that is. Why have I botched so many names?

533
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:23,220
That's so odd. I'm just thinking about this now. How odd that is. Mast Herman. But for real thank

534
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:28,630
you so much Hero Man for the 10 bucks. You made a rat movie and a movie inspired by a rat movie.

535
01:44:29,829 --> 01:44:37,449
When you got it done give it a link. Why do I support Boston teams? It's I think it's this

536
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:44,329
weird scenario where I grew up on the east coast and grew up in Boston in the 30 years of my life.

537
01:44:44,329 --> 01:44:48,329
Something like that. I don't know. It's weird how that you you know you rip the team that's closest

538
01:44:48,329 --> 01:44:55,060
to you somehow. I'm I don't know. It's weird. How does that how that works? Vegas gets a baseball

539
01:44:55,060 --> 01:45:05,720
team. I'll be a Vegas baseball fan and they win. That's what are you talking about? You're from

540
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:12,840
Massachusetts. You spent 30 plus years in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts based teams win all the

541
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:28,579
fucking time. Why are you a fan of the Boston area teams? Why wouldn't I be? You have to admit that

542
01:45:28,579 --> 01:45:37,720
Boston fans are the worst in the country. Why would I do that? Red Sox Nation. Red Sox Nation

543
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:56,810
representing here. Duncan. Red Sox. Duncan. Red Sox. Duncan. Red Sox. I just had that's pretty

544
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:04,020
much five out of ten conversations you'll have in downtown Boston. Hey Duncan. Yeah yeah it's a

545
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:16,090
launch. Red Sox. Yeah. Hey Duncan. Duncan Sox. You got it. That's how fucking like deals are made

546
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,930
over here. When they're building buildings in Boston that's how they that's what they do. They

547
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:29,140
oops. Oh yeah I'm from out of town. I'm from Wisconsin. I'm here on a contract duty.

548
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:35,460
I was just wondering how tall we're going to be making the floors here. I heard maybe 15 or 16

549
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:46,199
stories high. Which one is it? Sox. 17. Okay. Now what about the uh how many doors are we going to

550
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:50,760
have? I heard we're going to have two doors double doors on the front and then single doors in the

551
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:57,539
back. Red Sox Nation. Okay so we're going to have two uh thank you for the clarification. Two double

552
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:15,449
doors in the front and one in the back. That's how it works. Hey Jack. Thank you Jack for the 250.

553
01:47:15,449 --> 01:47:23,189
What's your favorite game you played in 2019? Resident Evil 2. Probably. We're talking about

554
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:34,710
games that released in 2019. Sekiro is definitely up there but Resident Evil 2 probably. It'd be

555
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:43,689
close because Sekiro was great. Hey have gone thanks for the 250. Hey Jeremy. It was fun

556
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:47,289
watching you play Sekiro but I was disappointed that you didn't take the Japanese voices

557
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:52,810
a spin. I saw Kraken play with the Japanese voices and it made the game feel like a Kurosawa film.

558
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:56,729
Plus the Japanese voice actors have more consistent pronunciations of the names.

559
01:47:56,729 --> 01:48:00,010
My favorite boss fight to watch was Isshin. What was your favorite boss battle?

560
01:48:00,729 --> 01:48:07,689
The first fight with Genichiro or the fight with Owl? Probably my favorites. Um I was supposed to

561
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:12,810
turn on the Japanese voice acting after the first like 40 minutes of the game. I'm just realizing

562
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:37,899
this now. Whoops. This. All right it's all right. The owl fight was pretty boring looking. I just

563
01:48:37,899 --> 01:48:45,420
liked the the flow of that fight. The horse guy was fun too. The Genichiro fight was the best I

564
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:52,300
think. That second phase was just so interesting for the first time seeing that with the lightning.

565
01:48:52,300 --> 01:49:00,069
Like that's he's the first person that you understand that with you know. And it's a really

566
01:49:00,069 --> 01:49:06,140
interesting mechanic. Doesn't feel bad. It feels fun to do. But thank you have gone. Thank you

567
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:11,659
Gondor Lane for the 250. A few days ago Jerma I actually had a dream of you. More dreams about

568
01:49:11,659 --> 01:49:15,260
hopefully this is not about like people like putting you in like a torture room or something

569
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:19,340
like the other one was. In the dream I was just browsing Twitch and I just saw you streaming and

570
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:24,460
saw that it said you were playing Sam and Max. I got so unbelievably excited then I woke up

571
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:31,020
and my heart sank. You were playing my favorite game. It's suggested often in the discord too.

572
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,460
Make us happy Jerma. It's a perfect wind down puzzle game although it's lengthy so you might

573
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:44,020
want to save it for a good weekend. All right I gotta I can tell you every time somebody brings

574
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:55,479
up Sam and Max at least a handful of people at least go don't do it. What's going on here?

575
01:49:55,479 --> 01:50:03,399
What's going on here? You just said you don't Gondor Lane just said don't do it. You just told

576
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:14,939
me that you had a dream about me playing it. What do you and you want what? Why did you say don't do

577
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:25,609
it? Don't you want me to do this? It is on a list. It is just one of those games that's probably

578
01:50:25,609 --> 01:50:33,939
gonna be chill on his hangout. It was his nightmare. Oh I see right but I can't give you any

579
01:50:34,579 --> 01:50:41,300
reason why it's gonna start or what it would happen or when. Just know that it is it is on a list.

580
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:55,210
It's on a notepad. It's just the stars need to align but love of god don't do it. But thank you

581
01:50:55,210 --> 01:51:01,050
I appreciate the enthusiasm and appreciate the dream. Why I mean you hated that dream. You got

582
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:08,979
like upset about that dream. I shouldn't be happy about that dream but thank you. George McCaw thanks

583
01:51:08,979 --> 01:51:13,220
for the 250. You're really good at these games but it's still fun to make fun of you losing.

584
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:29,779
I love everything you do bud. Nice RP here by the way. What? Nice RP? Oh I gotta get like

585
01:51:29,779 --> 01:51:38,279
PictoPix out of here. The PictoPix was playing over. All right this is nice RP. Let's see what

586
01:51:38,279 --> 01:52:09,430
they mean by this. Where is it? Where is it? Come on say it. Say it. I didn't even. Here we go.

587
01:52:10,069 --> 01:52:14,229
I didn't even have it. No he was gonna say it. He was gonna say it. He was gonna do it.

588
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:30,779
You are so dramatic. He was gonna say I wouldn't even ready or I didn't even have the right thing

589
01:52:30,779 --> 01:52:42,630
equipped or I should have the hitbox was so big you're gonna hear at least one of them.

590
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:46,779
Fuck this guy. I'm gonna go watch German at A5. There's dirt in my controller. Yeah this is

591
01:52:46,779 --> 01:52:50,939
disgusting. It really is. Get a list of all the things I've said and how many times I've said

592
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:58,520
them. It'd be embarrassing for me to see it. You want to like embarrass me on stream? Pick out all

593
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:03,399
the times that I said something like that and count them. It would probably be the same audio

594
01:53:03,399 --> 01:53:17,319
clip like fucking 50 times and it would be an embarrassment. Hey Tingy thanks for the 250.

595
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:20,520
This is the best Iron Chef icebreaker. It's called beer.

596
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:28,619
This guy like does like flips and shit.

597
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:54,819
You gotta okay give give him credit to do a big elaborate like this is the thing that I'm revealing

598
01:53:54,899 --> 01:54:06,600
right beer is one syllable beer beer it's got to be longer beer that's how I would do it I would

599
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:25,029
go beer today's secret ingredient is beer I do you know the line uh thank you masked hero man for

600
01:54:25,029 --> 01:54:30,300
the ten dollars just a few minutes ago here's a link straight from Herman's mind Herman's mind

601
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:59,399
what the hell is this oh this is a 3d movie maker

602
01:55:01,609 --> 01:55:13,510
I'm surprised people can even get this to run this up you guys there's a 21 minute video holy

603
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:24,250
shit how long did this take you to make I remember when I went through 3d movie maker

604
01:55:28,010 --> 01:55:32,649
I would have to restart and do different clips and do and pull it different segments because after

605
01:55:32,649 --> 01:55:46,819
like five minutes of actually in the editor the thing would break down you just don't need to

606
01:55:46,819 --> 01:55:52,420
stream yourself making rat movie three oh no that would be no it just takes too long it takes me so

607
01:55:52,420 --> 01:56:08,310
long to do that shit I don't think anyone would want to really see that but thank you masked hero

608
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:26,220
man it took four days that it all on stream well that would be fucking I can't imagine how crazy

609
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:34,659
that would be and do I have trans parents of my planets I don't I really don't it's just the

610
01:56:34,659 --> 01:56:40,659
emotes it's the emotes that are just blown up I don't have like high quality uh trans parents of

611
01:56:40,659 --> 01:56:56,170
them that would be your most popular stream what a bad practice but it's more authentic that way

612
01:56:58,819 --> 01:57:06,819
when Ashley did the shirt she actually like re-drew it and used the emotes too as references and tried

613
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:18,090
to copy them and stuff there was like a couple of different versions she's very talented let's just

614
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:24,539
put it that way uh let's get the credits up here these are all the subs tonight there were a lot of

622
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:48,810
the 250 I was just watching kitchen nightmares today and I realized I have a new respect for

623
01:58:48,810 --> 01:58:54,409
Gordon because he just shoves his hand in the grossest food and kitchen grime and just says

624
01:58:54,489 --> 01:59:02,039
what the fuck is this while his hand is coated in two-week-old oil and rotten chicken wild stuff

625
01:59:02,039 --> 01:59:13,579
yeah that is kind of yeah that's crazy he eats this food too in kitchen nightmares he'll just

626
01:59:13,579 --> 01:59:16,939
sit there at the beginning and be like oh like yeah what yeah give me the crab cakes and he'll

627
01:59:16,939 --> 01:59:20,699
eat them even if he knows that the place is about to shut down because it's disgusting

628
01:59:24,539 --> 01:59:29,180
didn't he quit kitchen nightmares because he kept getting sick from the food that would be crazy if

629
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:39,819
that was true I don't know if that's true that's ridiculous but thank you for the 250 Jess Garfield

630
01:59:39,819 --> 01:59:44,859

631
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:49,500
comic you know how much time I spend in the writing room developing this don't you remember my links

632
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:55,699
don't stink when Garf has ever when has Garf ever led you astray now read the comic where I'm unsubbing

633
01:59:55,699 --> 02:00:06,060

635
02:00:12,649 --> 02:00:22,939
though is it can't get rid of me that easy that emote is so bad do you see what that looks like

636
02:00:22,939 --> 02:00:36,550
up close can I at least change the name of this emote why did you guys vote for mustard no it

637
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:51,479
doesn't make any sense at all not even a remote smidge of sense you guys voted for this name

638
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:56,420
people come in here and they think that I made this emote called germa mustard and they're like

639
02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:03,699

night vr josh right at the end thank you for the 250 hey German for one of your future vr streams

643
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:40,659
I highly suggest looking into a free program called live it's free and on steam it lets you

644
02:01:40,659 --> 02:01:46,500
composite yourself into the vr games really easily and looks awesome works best with a green screen

645
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:55,420
but they also have tools to composite other backgrounds too I've actually seen this yeah I

646
02:01:55,420 --> 02:02:05,909
have seen you just I feel like I would want a bigger room for this though that I unfortunately

647
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:13,979
this room is not big enough for this to work because I just have barely enough room for you

648
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:19,399
guys to even have a face cam pointing at me and for me to do a room skill this is really really

02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:32,380

653
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:09,180
