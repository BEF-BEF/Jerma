1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,779
Hello, how are you? Good to see you.

2
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,580
Uh, you know, I was supposed to be live like 10 minutes ago, but I, uh,

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,539
all like the Twitch stuff, I lost all my connections with all the stuff that I had connected.

4
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:26,420
So my like streaming service stuff that I use, I had to like re-log in.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,339
So fuck! How you doing?

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:39,049
Oh, here he is. First stream since the leaks. We have to hear what he has to say.

7
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:45,859
Well, first of all, I'll tell you, I was, I was just as surprised as probably maybe a lot of you were.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,299
I did not think that I was in that category. I just really didn't.

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,219
When I saw that list, I was like, holy shit, wow, look at these top 100 fucking streamers.

10
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,740
And they make a shitload of money. I wonder where I am. I'm 98. What?

11
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,180
Wait, how? What? How? I was very surprised.

12
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,739
He's a billionaire. No, no, no. I'm not gonna, look, I'm not gonna touch too much upon this.

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,180
Uh, you guys, I try to be transparent with money with you guys.

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,060
Hopefully I have been.

15
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,459
Now you know exactly the amount of money that I have taken in from twitch.tv

16
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,819
in the last like two plus years.

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,959
And whatever, I'm just gonna keep using it. That's all there is to it.

18
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:41,579
Number 98. Pay back your debt. The debt's like billions. I only have whatever it was.

19
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,870
I don't even have that by the way. That's over the last two, two years and one month, two months.

20
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:53,189
I've been using it. I don't even have it. I don't even have any money.

21
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,040
No, I'm gonna make a really just clear before italics is waiting, but let me make a really

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,969
clear statement on this. Um, don't ever give this channel money unless like you absolutely

23
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:13,240
can afford to. There's literally no reason for you to give this channel more than a sub ever.

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,159
I just want to make that really clear. I hope that people don't think they have to give this

25
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,379
channel money. Hopefully I've been clear on that the last five years or so. Um, and I know I don't

26
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,099
want to even, I don't want to talk about this too much because I know anytime you talk about like

27
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,129
money, you're coming like a bunch of primes. I don't want, that's not what this is for.

28
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:36,310
I'm not even going to address them, but I'm just going to keep trying to do what I can and

29
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,560
use it on the stream. Use it on me too, right? Like I want to make sure that,

30
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:49,159
because there's another thing that's really worth bringing up too, is I mean, I don't know how long

31
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,680
this is going to last. I don't think anybody does. So I want to make sure that if I'm going to make

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,819
this kind of money, I want to have like investments and put it into like accounts that are going to

33
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,629
like be okay in five to 10 years. Cause I have no idea how long this is going to last. But there

34
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:13,289
are far other people on this platform that are not in the top 100, top 200 that you should probably

35
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:23,370
be giving your sub to every month. It's probably not me anymore. Let's be honest, right? But we,

36
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:33,830
I could talk about this for like another four hours. Invest in a proper e-clown car. First,

37
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,189
second, I thought you said proper e-clown. All right. It's Alex is waiting. Let me say hello.

38
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,879
Hey, sorry. I forgot that I haven't addressed the leak since I streamed last. And that happened like

39
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:58,949
in the middle of the week. Yeah. The leak, the leak, what being like a top 30,000 streamer,

40
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,669
just making a casual average minimum wage on Twitch. What's there to reveal.

41
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:15,819
All right. We're playing Far Cry 6 today. It's Alex. You don't know who he is. How could you not

42
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:21,110
at this point? Everybody knows who I am because they're real viewers and gamers.

43
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,879
I think we're already in the game, right? Yeah, we are in the game. I have to run ads. No,

44
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,360
I'm not going to run ads. Like what, you don't understand though. Do you guys get it? Why like,

45
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,199
Oh, maybe he should start running ads. Oh, give us ads, Jerma. What? Are you serious? Why would I,

46
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,759
why would I do that? There's a bunch of people in your chat saying who right now.

47
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,199
Are they? Did you tell them to wear their name tags to the stream today?

48
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:54,699
I, well, you have your name tag on. Sometimes I feel like I have to wear a name tag.

49
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:05,189
I feel like they don't know who I am. All right, let's go. Did I even tweet this? Okay. I'm just

50
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:12,939
going to retweet yours because I'm incredibly lazy. There, that's it. There we go. See? I was

51
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:17,019
talking about how professional we were like doing the whole tutorial before the stream even started.

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,899
Yeah. But I mean, that's something you have to do in, in these games. And by the way,

53
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:24,459
people are quite curious about the title. I've never sat through an entire Far Cry game. I walk

54
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:28,939
out of the movie in the first act and I keep seeing the sequels. Don't, I don't know why we

55
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:35,100
keep doing this. We go to the Far Cry movie. We don't, we get up and leave the movie and you like

56
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,139
effectively showed up late. And I don't mean that as a stream joke. I mean, like you, you,

57
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,819
you got into the seat, you crawled over, the lights are already off. You skipped all the cut

58
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:49,019
scenes to get here. I got to like explain the plot. Yeah. I actually truly have no fucking idea

59
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:55,100
what's going on because he did the tutorial last night and I was unaware that, well, he told me,

60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,699
but I just didn't do it because I'm busy. So he did the tutorial last night. It's about an hour

61
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,500
and he's like, Hey, did you do, did you do the tutorial yet? And I'm like, no, it's like,

62
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,980
can I get through it in like an hour? And he's like, yeah, there's a bunch of cut scenes though.

63
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,579
So I'm not kidding. I wish I had it recorded. I sprinted through every single thing. I

64
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,220
mashed space bar to skip every single cut scene. I don't even know how to crouch. I have no idea.

65
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,019
I just had, I held shift the whole time. But anyways, this is the first segment is like a

66
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:32,490
stealth section too. I just sprint. I ran right through it. I just ran through it. Somebody said,

67
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,459
I thought you were done playing Ubisoft games. Uh, this isn't an Ubisoft game. This is Far Cry.

68
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:46,470
It's the same game every time we already played Far Cry four and five. So you can rest assured

69
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,430
this is no different. Yeah. But why do we keep going to the movie? This is like you, okay.

70
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,069
So again, let's say if Far Cry was a movie and you and I went to the movie together

71
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,769
and after like 30 minutes of that movie, we were like, I'm leaving. This movie sucks. Right. And

72
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:07,350
we leave the movie. Why do we keep going to the sequels? Oh, Hey dude, Hey, Far Cry five just

73
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,790
came out. Oh, we like, didn't really care that much. And we just kind of goofed around for like

74
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,069
three hours in the first. Why do we keep going to the monstrous sequels and leaving boss baby?

75
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,949
You don't, you don't watch the whole movie boss, baby. You watch like 30 seconds and then you skip

76
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,629
like 10 minutes and then you watch like 30 more seconds. This is what we're doing with all the

77
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,709
these movies, trying to see what happens. Oh, you go, you talk about the, uh, the, the skip to the

78
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:36,699
movie thing. Yeah. I love doing that. I think you have to talk to this person. We need to talk.

79
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:43,189
Cause this is your, this is your game, not mine. I accept. Hit that slave camp hard.

80
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,269
Okay. I thought she was, she put the gun out. I thought she was going to shoot you.

81
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,720
She was like aiming it at you for a second. Okay. Where do we go? I don't, I have no idea

82
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,040
what's going on, dude. I have absolutely no idea what's happening. I don't know who that person is.

83
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:03,160
The very first like thing anybody hears in the game is go hit that slave camp hard. That,

84
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,399
you know, that's exactly what we're going to do. I don't even know. I don't even know where we are.

85
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:20,339
All right, let's go. You could probably like just, I honestly, wait, we haven't,

86
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:25,430
we have an alligator. Remember that we do. Yes. We have two alligators and you can,

87
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:32,149
you can press E on the alligator. Isn't that so cute? You feed alligator. I already did this.

88
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:40,730
They drop like, you drop like a ham sandwich in his mouth. Come here. I want to do that to mine too.

89
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:53,980
Holy, what the fuck happened? I was just trying to cook the steak. What the hell are you doing?

90
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,070
It was just going to be like a cooked steak joke. I don't know. I thought, I don't know. All right,

91
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,509
let's go. Let's give me do a mission. We start the game even though I already did. I don't know

92
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:12,539
what's going on. But yeah, welcome guys. This is Far Cry 6. How come you run faster than me?

93
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:21,720
Hold on. First bug. First bug? First bug. Oh, I thought you said like a beetle or something.

94
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,460
No, do you see this person? I don't see anybody. She is flying like a T-posing Jesus in my game.

95
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:38,330
I don't see that. I see a gun just sitting here. It's just a floating gun. Can you get on the horse?

96
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:47,159
Don't please put it away. Can you get it? No, I don't. Look, we have to at least get on the road.

97
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,399
Okay, you need your own horse. Just get a little further downhill. I could jump on that.

98
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,659
Wait, what if you get on the zip line and then land on me?

99
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:10,789
Easy. I can't. Hold on. That's stupid. Run his ass off. Holy shit. Oh my god, that was horrible.

100
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:17,129
Are you all right? Yeah, I'm good. All right. So we're going to go in this way.

101
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:23,929
So there's horses in this game. Why does this feel like it's like 10 FOV? It's going to make

102
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:30,309
me want to puke. I already changed it. You're probably going to get like leashed back to me.

103
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:35,240
You can only be so far from me. I have to like keep the like, you know, the backpack

104
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:50,490
with the child. Are you really that far away? Okay, I got to turn the FOV up. It's like 95.

105
00:10:50,490 --> 00:11:00,009
I have it so high already. It's at 95. Should I put it like 110? I think it's just like small

106
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:05,690
on the horse. I think when you get on the horse, it just zooms in to like a nauseating level.

107
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,879
Maybe it does. Okay. All right. So we need to go meet Julio. Driving FOV is forced FOV. Okay. I see.

108
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:23,740
I need to find, we need to find like a vehicle. Otherwise we're going to have to walk everywhere.

109
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,460
Oh, I'm already there. Oh, I'm coming. Characters like get tired in this park, right?

110
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:42,070
Random. I can't talk to this person though. This is your game. Yes. You're just passing through

111
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:56,820
and the alligator attack him. I got here way before you did. Yeah. Cause I had to walk the whole way.

112
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:05,299
All right. I'm coming. Wait, what? Hold. I had it on toggle. What is this bullshit? I did. I swear

113
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:19,850
to God. What the fuck? Where is it? Okay. There's so many options in this game. How long did it take

114
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:25,220
you to actually sit here and go through each one of these? Um, I didn't. I just turned off motion

115
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:32,570
blur. What are you, what are you changing right now? I don't like to hold, uh, aim down sights.

116
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:38,009
Really? You toggled? Yeah. Toggle gamer? Cause I don't, the pressure with my, uh, Tony. Yes.

117
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:42,169
The pressure on my middle finger hurts. What do you use middle finger? Middle finger is,

118
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,179
that's right. Click is for middle mouse button. I'm just kidding. I don't use that either. I was

119
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,779
going to say, what are you talking about? All right. Will you talk to this guy?

120
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:57,720
Finally, I'm not going to bullshit you. I wanted to do this alone, but Clara give me an order.

121
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,840
I can handle myself. Is there a punch? So he should be here right now, but instead I get you.

122
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,360
And I'm supposed to be a Miami, but instead his health bar. I'm stuck here with you.

123
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:18,309
He can't die. Can he? Enough talk. Step one, we hit the tobacco. Step two, we destroy their

124
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:24,070
poison supply. Step three, we get the fuck out of there. And Castillo gets a nice pretty

125
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:36,629
message from you. He uses toggle. Yes, I do. No, I get the horse. That's all right. He's like

126
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:41,190
running after you. He's like, what are you doing? Wait, would you just teleport it over here? Wait,

127
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:52,490
what happened? Why is he choking? What's he choking on? What did he eat? All right, let's go. Leave

128
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,409
the horse. We're just doing all the same jokes from the last one. We're watching the same movie.

129
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,929
It's okay to do the same jokes because we're watching the same movie. He's waiting for me.

130
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,649
I don't know. Where's the farm? I don't know. You killed him. You screwed everything up,

131
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:14,820
I think. He'll protect you from fire. And more importantly, Castillo's fucking poison.

132
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,179
Okay, here we go. So what do we have to do? He gave me some gloves. He gave me oven mitts.

133
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:27,620
All right, suit up with that gear. All right. Pretty sick. All right, what we got? We need

134
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:46,620
different gloves. How does this even work? Hazmat? I think I got it on. There it is. What? All right,

135
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,799
did you do the how to change gear tutorial? No, yeah, I did it already. Oh, here it is. You're

136
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,179
not wearing the gloves. Let's put them on. There you go. That's the first time I've seen the inside

137
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:02,730
of the fucking menu. What is that there for? All right. Are you ready? Let's go get like a car or

138
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:08,970
something. I don't want to walk 700 miles. Let's go. That's a good horse. Wait, he's going too?

139
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,370
Are we going to the blue? What's the blue mark? It says follow him. So I think you go walk near

140
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:26,870
him. Oh, okay. But don't run him over though. Is this the walk and talk? It probably is.

141
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:34,330
We actually do get a flamethrower. That's pretty crazy. If I could change anything,

142
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,769
it would be me dying on that horse. Okay, the horse is just. I wish I had one. And if she

143
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:53,899
loved you, well, then you could do this. Oh my God. Okay, need to know or challenge complete

144
00:15:53,899 --> 00:16:02,139
Ubisoft Connect XP earning. That's way too huge of a notification. He's almost dead. Did I do that?

145
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:07,820
Yes. Get it on your skin. It can make you go fucking crazy or sit like deep down. What happens

146
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,299
if he dies though? We probably have to restart it. So let's let's actually try to just get through

147
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:18,139
the first co-op mission. It's a quarter of the screen. Jeremy's going to shoot and kill the

148
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:23,820
NPC. No, I'm not. He is. He is proven already that he's the one doing that this spring.

149
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,419
I haven't killed anybody yet. He's still alive. You killed him. I had to revive him. He was just

150
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:35,740
down. That wasn't dead. That's why he still got half health. Right behind you. Oh, yeah.

151
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:42,120
Don't we have like cell phone cameras? I actually can't fit the horse through here.

152
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:54,919
Get over here. All right. Horse is getting abandoned. Okay, so we need to follow him up

153
00:16:54,919 --> 00:17:00,250
to the top. Yeah, but like what happens if you shoot him while he's on the ladder? He's probably

154
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:07,160
gonna fall off. I don't want to craft anything by the way. I don't even like. Oh, there's

155
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,539
hang on. There's crafting in this game. Of course there is. See the tobacco and the yellow poison

156
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:20,150
tanks. Okay, so we have to scout. Punch holes in the tanks to let the poison out into the air.

157
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,150
By the way, what kind of iPhone is this where they can get this clear of an image

158
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,630
zooming in this much? It's the kind like, okay, so for context, your side character dies

159
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,029
when a boat gets shot full of holes and they drown. Oh, okay. But on the beach,

160
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:41,670
the first thing they do is say give me my phone and it's still working even though they just like

161
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:51,190
washed up on the shore. The phone's like. It's like a super phone. Are you scanning right now?

162
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:57,029
I'm just I'm looking around at stuff. I don't know how to do that. Oh, hit X. How do I know

163
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:06,380
that you don't? Oh, because I pushed like the other phone. There's no way you get that kind

164
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,960
of image from this month. Let's make some chaos. Are you fucking kidding me? When I like zoom in

165
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,160
to take a picture of a bee at one foot away, it's still kind of blurry. Are you kidding me? All

166
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:26,869
right. Well, whatever. He just he went down already, man. It's a video game. No, it's not.

167
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:33,000
It's real life. Listen, just give iPhone another like seven iterations. They'll have them out in

168
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,079
the next two years and they'll have camera quality like that. They're purposely holding

169
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:43,000
back camera quality so they have another iPhone to release next year. So I can destroy the yellow

170
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,819
poison tank. What the fuck is the alligator doing? How do you be stealthy with an alligator?

171
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:59,859
See what I'm talking about? Like what? How is this a stealth game? By the way, did you turn off bars?

172
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:04,660
Well, what would I do? I shot somebody I wasn't supposed to. I think you just shot a civilian.

173
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:22,180
What is going on? Destroy the tanks. They've got like poison guns. We have to sabotage. It is so

174
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:30,619
loud. I can't even get through the door. You're not even listening to this when your compound's

175
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:36,700
getting like raided by two special agents. How do I get through the door? What's happening?

176
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,910
Who's this guy? I got an enemy. Oops. Oh shit. Hold on. Are we doing the Ubisoft play? All right.

177
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,589
Coming up on your right here. I'm going to need some support. All right. Sure. Calling it an

178
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:55,859
airdrop airdrop. What do you want it? Where should I put it? Hey, there's a guy shooting at us over

179
00:19:55,859 --> 00:20:02,009
here. Why is it on fire? I got one. I cannot move. I can't fucking move. I can't move the cursor.

180
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,769
I'm giving you some cover fire. Is that going to be right on top of us? Oh, fuck.

181
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:19,430
No shit. I can right click. Where is this? What am I looking at? You're on your own for a second.

182
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:25,690
I have to turn this down. It is so loud. How do I get? I can't get off of this. Okay. Wait,

183
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,670
you just say a Spanish swear word. I don't know why some of the gun sounds so much louder than

184
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:45,180
other ones. Eel. It's because one of them has a silencer on it. Okay. We only did 17%. Oh,

185
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:58,500
we're going to get this car. Where's the music coming from? Um, how do I drive this? W I get,

186
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,460
why can't I go to the front seat? Oh, are you kidding me? Yeah. Um, I'm taking this thing.

187
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Oh, okay. To sabotage the plantation. Here we go. Yeah. We've only destroyed 20%. I think we

188
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,220
have to like, hang on. Wait a second. Are they doing the like, beginning of the game is the

189
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:34,839
first question. Sorry. That was scared the shit out of me. I don't know why. What was that? Oh

190
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:44,569
shit. This guy, like I just exploded into blood. Oh no, it wasn't. I thought he just like turned

191
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:59,690
into blood mist. It's this guy. Oh my God. All right. Get me out of here. Oh shit. This is bad.

192
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:11,460
All right. Alligator is okay. Oh my God. What the fuck? He won't let me in.

193
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:22,579
Okay. Burn the red tobacco plants with my, with my toadster USB stick. All right. We got to burn

194
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:36,569
these plants and do it. Where's my plan? There. All right. Here we go. Oh shit. It burns.

195
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:52,470
You think Spanish songs are still DMC able? I think everything is. Wait, collect gasoline.

196
00:22:53,269 --> 00:23:07,769
What do I do with this? Watch out, get out of there. How are you supposed to safely do this without

197
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:13,289
getting burned? I'm just saying it, but you know, if the DMC people can't understand the lyrics,

198
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:23,099
then maybe it's an algorithm, man. It's an algorithm. Okay. Where are you right now?

199
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:26,859
And why are you not helping me burn all this? I, I'm over here burning other farms.

200
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,099
This is co-op. It's cooperative. I don't burn the same farm you're burning. That's redundant.

201
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:48,700
Oh, back to front. All right. We're at 50%. This was not a stealth mission anyway. No,

202
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,519
this is like a, you destroy everything. 3d movie jumpscare.

203
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,980
Okay. All right. I don't have any more gasoline. It picks them up from a barrel. I have been

204
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:21,640
even made one weed joke. No, I mean, that's so easy. There are no weed jokes. Can I like,

205
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:37,099
I can't just like cut this down. I changed my weapon. Does that work? He's just on fire

206
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:45,940
running through all this. Now I'm on fire. There's still some over here. Do you have any gas left?

207
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm trying to shoot the plants to get rid of them. Really? I'm just saying you can destroy

208
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:01,700
the yellow barrels. Wait, that's where the music's coming from. That's it. Okay. You just get the

209
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,859
shit out of me. I've got a blue friendly icon over my head. This is where the music's coming from.

210
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:13,140
So you couldn't tell it was me. This is what I see the volume indicator. That's what the music's

211
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:23,980
coming from. What? I don't know what just happened. Yeah, that was a, oh, that's a good guy.

212
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:37,380
Okay. Oh shit. What? I have great. Okay. What? Oh, that was, that was my like three and overwatch.

213
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:48,420
I don't even know what the fuck I just did. First of all, overwatch joke in 2021.

214
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,859
Second of all, it's the only watchers in smite. That's the only, the only two moments.

215
00:25:52,420 --> 00:26:01,210
Well, we did it. We did it. We can, we can go back on my way. Yeah, I think we're good. We can keep

216
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:10,059
on. We'll both head back to large stone tower. All right. We did it. Make sure you get your,

217
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:19,130
your, where is this music coming from? I think it's just thematic. It's just there to like,

218
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,190
get you all jazzed up, dude. But I don't, there's no context to where it will be coming from though.

219
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,539
I don't know. We're apparently sticking it to the government by destroying the drugs,

220
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:39,859
which seems counterintuitive. All right, songs over. But I think they're laced with poison.

221
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:43,220
Fake raid. Somebody said fake. I don't see a raid, but fake raid.

222
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:54,500
Vinny just tried to raid you, but accidentally raided a fake germa. What? Hold on. That, that,

223
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:08,069
is that what happened? Well, hi everybody. That I guess not here. He forgot the nine eight five.

224
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:13,750
Oh shit. Well, thanks anyways. It's appreciate it. Is this not the large stone tower?

225
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:22,859
This looks like it. He's over there though. Wait, he's coming this way. He's pathing.

226
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:35,509
Oops. You're okay. Yeah. He was just walking through like the brush. Oops. Yeah. But thanks

227
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:41,509
Vinny. If you're watching, that's actually fucking hilarious. Fake germa got a raid.

228
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:50,549
Uh, but hey guys, welcome playing Far Cry 6 with it's Alex. Are you, is he good? I think he's good.

229
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:56,089
Shit. You really can hold your own. I don't want to say I told you. Did you do your super move?

230
00:27:56,089 --> 00:28:01,849
Don't fuck around. Don't do that. Stop. What are you throwing at him? This is just the beginning.

231
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:10,329
What is those? What do you, how do you do that? How do I do that? Stop. Oh yeah. You're telling

232
00:28:10,329 --> 00:28:17,609
me to stop. You're like interrupting the NPC cut scene. How do I do it? Okay. It's a

233
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:26,089
middle mouse. Yeah. I thought you said it was middle mouse. It is. You have to hit Q

234
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,809
and then mouse over the, uh, the holster and then mouse wheel.

235
00:28:30,809 --> 00:29:03,500
Oh my God. I don't know who it is. Is it him? I'm trying to cut the screams off.

236
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:12,170
It's then now he's screaming in my game though. All right. If we bring him back,

237
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:20,859
let's do the screaming stuff. Okay. Holy shit, dude. That was insane. It was just like,

238
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:31,049
somebody was screaming in my ear. I swear to God. Oh, head back to the tower. All right. You want

239
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:36,009
to grab a horse? Uh, yeah, we got two horses here. Are you good? Is this streaming? Yeah. I,

240
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:41,130
apparently it's, apparently we're fine. I still got to talk to him. Hold on. I can't believe you

241
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,609
weren't hearing that. It was like a loud human scream in my ear. And they're going to see the

242
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:51,130
smoke. We work well together. See, listen, if you were good with it, you did good. Sorry,

243
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,589
I doubted you. See you back at camp. Okay. Now we're good. That was a quick turn. All right.

244
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:11,700
Oh, nice. Now we both have horses. Awesome. Um, do you want to leave or should I?

245
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:22,069
Do we have a mission? We should find a car. I mean, this car is back in the, in the drug lab.

246
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:37,369
Can you do that? What? Apparently not. Oh yeah. There you go. Nice. My horse wasn't professionally

247
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:42,619
trained. Oh, we're on the phone. I hope you can see the smoke from where you are.

248
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:51,990
Stop hurting my horse. He's hurting, but okay. I think Lita would be smiling right now.

249
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,869
Danny, there's someone I want you to meet. Oh, new quest. He's a local fisherman,

250
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,670
which means votes for Lieberkant. He lives on the east side of Casas Cove.

251
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:06,470
Always got nobody's in here. Oh, come on. Really? That would have been really funny.

252
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,819
So I've been following the story so far and basically here's how it works. Literally any

253
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:19,380
person who has speaking lines gets shot in the head at some point. It happens about five times

254
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,099
in the prologue. Really? Yeah. So, um, basically just violence is the answer, I think.

255
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:31,700
I mean, I will say the game is, it's, it's very pretty. It's like the, really the graphics are

256
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,660
wild. It's only been, uh, we only have been playing for 20 minutes. You're already making

257
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:41,140
justifications for your future six out of 10. Okay. Um, I'm, I do. We really, every one of these

258
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,059
is a six out of 10 locked in. It's grayed out. You can't even, you can't even scroll your mouse

259
00:31:45,059 --> 00:32:01,880
over it. It's grayed out. It's locked in six out of 10. Dude, why would you swerve to my right?

260
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh, fuck. Oh no. Is he all right? Oh shit. It was random. Is he okay? He's fine. He's all right.

261
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:26,789
He's all right. He's still moving around. Get out of here. What the fuck? No, I didn't want

262
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:47,960
that to happen. Hey, don't give me that. I can't. What's that? I can't get off of him.

263
00:32:54,579 --> 00:33:09,609
This guy. I don't know, man. I don't know why I'm riding this guy's ass. You're going too far away

264
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:13,450
from your partner. Oh shit. I'm going to lose you. You ran over my horse. I'm like running towards

265
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:23,079
you. Wait, where are you? I'm about to hijack a car. Okay. Good. Good. You have to come to me.

266
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:35,430
Okay. Is that you? Wait, are you on my? I'm so confused right now. I have no idea what's going

267
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:43,720
on. Is that, that's you. It's me. Yeah. Can we get the truck? Yeah. Oh, you just knocked the tree

268
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:51,029
down on top of it, but he's fine. Okay. Let's go. Where are we going? Uh, you're, you're the pilot.

269
00:33:51,029 --> 00:34:11,289
Okay. I'm the pilot. What the fuck did you throw that? That guy say, I know I heard something.

270
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,420
Yeah. There's a, there's a bad guys are in red. That's how you know they're bad.

271
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,900
And the good guys are in there. That's how you know they're good. The ex gorilla at his shipyard. Can

272
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,500
you, um, can you give like a waypoint for us? Oh, it's over here. What the fuck was that?

273
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:35,210
Just dogs. They just spawned out of nowhere. They live here. Why are you chasing them? I'm going to

274
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:45,980
the marker. See it's the star thing. My character is bored with you driving. So he's just humming to

275
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:58,469
himself. You are humming. Are we the questers? I think these are, these are questers. Is this a

276
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:09,619
fishing? Might be. There was a joke attempt, but you need a little bit more distance.

277
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:17,139
The best part is he's looking over there because the explosions happened over there.

278
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:23,750
You're in the big leagues now. It's just the, the sound is what made him us afraid. Not the visual.

279
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:32,070
Good. Well, you don't have any friends. One just shut up and call for a car. Oh, a car. Okay.

280
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:38,460
And you don't want to craft. Okay. I actually probably a good idea. I don't. Can we even

281
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:45,639
craft anything? I think so. Okay. I'm going to do, I'm going to do standard rounds in this

282
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:58,150
way. No soft target. They stand around the fine, right? I mean, sure. Charms. Oh, this is a

283
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:11,000
cosmetic. Oh, I have skins. Dude, did you get the ultimate edition with like cyberpunk skins?

284
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,130
Absolutely not. Um, I did all your ride using Q. Okay. Your ride will be delivered to you.

285
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:29,110
Okay. Is we actually going to get DMCA for these? I don't, I, I don't know. It was maybe,

286
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:35,659
um, hold on. Are we, are we ghostbusters? This, you can throw fucking baseballs. People,

287
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:39,340
this game just went, it went a full letter grade. That's what I was doing earlier.

288
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,139
I was doing that 30 minutes ago when you asked me what I was doing. Oh my God. Oh my God. This

289
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:44,460
got a full letter grade. I thought you were throwing, I thought you were throwing knives

290
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:58,219
at somebody. I mean, I can do that too. Oh, all right. No stops. So now we have to call our ride.

291
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:09,480
I don't have that option. You just put, you hold Q. That was a bad guy.

292
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,000
It was a bad guy. Yeah, it was a bad guy. Oh, but you can carry bodies.

293
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:25,980
Hey, do you, I think, do you have to call a ride? See if you can give you access to a ride.

294
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:49,909
You're psycho rides on the way. All right. No, don't, you just got this. It's so,

295
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:57,110
it's so hard to like judge the range. All right. You drive. I'll be the, I'll be the guy that goes

296
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:03,590
gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk, gunk. Let's see. Oh no, I was wrong. Okay.

297
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,090
Where are we going? I don't know.

298
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:22,820
Look, anti aircraft cannons. Okay. Secure drives to the right for no reason.

299
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:32,070
You got all of them, like what the, you, those are bad guys, right? I don't think two of them were.

300
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,750
I think they were just like, just going to desynchronize me. Like assassin's creed.

301
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:48,349
They were wearing red you can't wear red out here my games lagging. Oh, there we go. I'll switch. Where you going?

302
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:53,690
I'm trying to drive in a straight line, but unironically it's pulling to the right. He's actually the gas station go

303
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:56,900
Why is it making the aim over there?

304
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,610
What I think auto-aim just took that over?

305
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:12,119
All right, let's go. Are you okay? You sold the car. I mean I was

00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:59,420
Are you hooked on to that car? Yes, are we going? Oh, no, here comes the ghost buster. Oh

309
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:13,909
Am I kind of scared of what's coming down the road here? How do you turn the radio off? Uh, left slash

310
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,199
Why?

311
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:23,429

315
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,719
Minus two. No, that would be a plus two. That'd be a minus two

316
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,760
See I am a person of refined taste and I was just waiting on a better option to arrive

317
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,860
But that that's a better option watch out for the alligator

318
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,809
Well, they can chat loves easy jokes. Somebody just said yeah

319
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:04,210

Okay, she's inspecting a military site. We have a lot of random shit to do. All right, let's do it

It's right here right there 238

330
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:15,510
Water's very clean. How the hell did you get from the car to there? I just swam

331
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:19,429
Okay. Yeah, but you like actually teleported from underwater

332
00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:27,969
Yeah, this only said that took ten seconds for you to do that, but it also keep in mind I

333
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,650
Saved us probably two or three minutes

334
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:35,780
driving that way, um

335
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,139
Something over on this other side here

336
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:49,409
Yeah, how do you get up there? Oh, I was just trying to make us that it's screaming

337
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:54,219
So this is gonna save us time

338
00:42:54,219 --> 00:43:07,539
It's your ass. It is. Yep. Thank you

339
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:24,550
Why have you done this? You know what?

340
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:38,230
All right, I'll activate it. Will you just teleport to me and you teleport to me?

341
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:50,599
Probably oh, it's right here. Okay, you can't ride wild horses. You really can

342
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:59,380
No, I mean, there's this tame and there's wild horses. I'd be my alligator gonna hang out

343
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:15,800
Turn on friendly fire. It's already on be careful. Don't go that don't fall. Oh, there you are

344
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,570
Over here where the I'm ready for the mission. Okay, you ready?

345
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:32,329
Which we're trespassing currently? I think pretty much everything we do in this frame is illegal. Oh

346
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,449
boat

347
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:40,070
That boats really far and probably not drivable. Oh, is it just an asset?

348
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,210
Is it just like a faraway like JP like whatever the image thing?

349
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:52,440
There are tanks we can ride too. Okay, so this is what is this?

350
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,989
Well, I think we've just

351
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:58,710
Who is who somebody talking to me? I think we're supposed to blow this tank up

352
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:10,789
What happened blue tank up? Oh you fired at me? Okay. All right. There was a tank. Hold on. How do I get you up?

353
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,440

00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,250
Wait, oh, we're supposed to drive it

00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,030
Get her

356
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:31,199
She's getting in the tank. She's getting in the tank. I'm just making you aware. She's in the tank now

357
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
She's driving the tank

358
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
She's just taking the first

359
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,969
Listen, why does it say repair the tank if they're gonna drive the tank?

360
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:46,659
Oh, why did you mortar me when I was standing next to it said destroy? I didn't listen

361
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:52,360
It said blow up the tank. It's fine. We're right here. We're fine. Let's go

362
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,480
Taking care of a commandant a problem for Benito

363
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:10,119
Find some high ground do some scouting before you alright, I'm stealth

364
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:18,239
I'm stealth. We're invisible. I'm inside of a flower patch. Oh fuck. I just looked at me. What the fuck off not stuff anymore

365
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,960
Like that guy's running to get in the tank by the way, he definitely is

366
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,280
Okay, he's getting inside the tank he's inside nobody else

367
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,360

What the fuck are you dead somebody's just named the tank of my face oh he was in it

369
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,480
Fire I thought that's the tank you were talking about you were like hiding behind that tank

370
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,719
It was like dude. Look somebody's running to take no now. They're getting in

371
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh my god

372
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,519
They saw me and they're running in the tank and I thought you were like setting up for a joke

373
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,760
I mean, I when he turned really slowly to look at me. I kind of wanted him to shoot me point-blank range

374
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,519
I'll be honest. I'll be honest with my voice just do it there. That was weird

375
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,280
popping it

376
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,159
All right, let's just let's get in here

377
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,809
Parachute is still on

378
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:34,750
Get your parachute off, bro

379
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:36,949
That's why they can see us

380
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:43,679
That is so stupid

381
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:53,219
Get in there and fight him on in there. It's your you're the birthday boy right now

382
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:59,409
Just to make sure everybody knows who the birthday boy is. Oh my god the tank

Hell, what do you mean help? I go. Let's actually for

385
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,409
Your

386
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:27,289
When they get in the tank, they just got the parachute does fucking the parachute just swept the whole thing up

387
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:29,289
Okay, it was a major distraction

388
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:35,090
I killed like eight people. Okay, we have to like go in there and just like sabotage the tanks with mortars and shit

389
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:42,960
We're gonna okay. All right, look

390
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,869
First of all, what let's just make sure what mission even is this go to the depot and free up the fuel so we can

391
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:55,530
Survive and kill the commandant. So they think twice about trying again. Okay, this is a major mission. We're about to do

392
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,760
This is rank four. Look, I bet I bet I could do this in stealth by myself. You think so? Yeah, okay

393
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Let's find out. I'll be watching

394
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,800
Okay. Hang on. I'm gonna leave Guapo here. I

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,710
Mark them for you. Yeah

396
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:33,760
Is that actually working? I got this

397
00:49:35,949 --> 00:49:45,090
Birthday boy assassination mission. Nice. Very very nice. Very nice. I think one person's running to me

398
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:47,929
You've got one person in front of you

399
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,610
We isn't on the mountain directly under you

400
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:58,659
Yep, they're coming in. I don't think they know of your presence yet. Somebody actually underneath me too. There's two people

401
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,840
Guy you're gonna be right in front of you. Careful. He's aiming his gun down towards the

402
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,440
the outside area

403
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:13,539
You see him? Okay, are they facing me or away from me? He is facing you and you are

404
00:50:14,019 --> 00:50:17,619
He's like above that lip. If you go if you jump up, he's gonna be right there looking at you

405
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:22,940
They're actually all coming up there right now. They're like climbing up there. Yes, that guy's climbing the ladder in front of you

406
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
What? That guy's climbing up there

407
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:27,559
There's a guy up here

408
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,329
You're chasing him right now. This guy knows you're chasing him. He's running away from you

409
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:42,960
Okay, now they're going up that ladder. Why are they all up there? I don't know. I think they heard you

410
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:51,909
I haven't been spotted yet. They're coming down sliding back down. They're both down. Oh

00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:04,730
Oh, you got you got two different people here. Oh here is the commander?

412
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,650
Yeah, the commander's here and there's three people on the other side

413
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:11,300
Listen, I need some Ubisoft call-outs

415
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:24,679
Well, watch out on your three three o'clock no nice nice three o'clock

416
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,239
Awesome, dude. Good job

417
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:29,719
Straight ahead

418
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,679
Watch out watch out

419
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:44,070
He's this guy's angry. This guy's angry up on your left side. You can see him right there right in front of him

420
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:53,750
Come on. Give him the booyah. There it is. Nice job. Nice job booyah. They're suspicious

421
00:51:53,750 --> 00:52:02,320
I don't know if you can really get these two

422
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,440
They see the body

423
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,159
The one on the far side is the one

424
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:11,789
No, it's really hard to not just get out of this binoculars and press V

425
00:52:11,789 --> 00:52:15,780
I tell you how hard it is for me not to do that right now. This guy sees

426
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,150
Uh-oh, you're not two people see oh, they all see now you're in trouble

427
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:25,630
That guy's true. That guy just threw ice bottle. I got a through like a way. What do you just do? He's really a firework

428
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:32,760
What the fuck is this guy doing? I got a shot of the layer in the

429
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,739
I just used my best stealth maneuver. Let me help you. Oh

430
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:51,059
Fuck oh wait, I killed him. Was that you? I just killed that guy. Is there a mortar? Yeah. Wait, hang on

431
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:58,619
You shot that was me. I shot it from here. You did yours and then I did mine and we did we doubled them

432
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,780
There was not a guy like you just mortared me. That was the only guy left

433
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:11,929
After that I got a sniper rifle

434
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,079
Okay, so that was cool. Let's get a tank

435
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:28,650
We actually drive this one enter as driver. Okay, can we both get why did it did it not let us drive?

436
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,210
During the mission

437
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,449
apparently not

438
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:37,619
If I don't get in this tank, I'm no I'm not going to I

439
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:43,579
Actually want to roll into the next mission with two tanks and scare the absolute shit out of the like four guards

440
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:51,789
We have to take down because this is mission number two of the game. Don't do it. No, we have to let's make it work

441
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:57,349
I I'd literally just looked I have to look where I'm going. The turret just happens to point where I'm looking

442
00:53:57,349 --> 00:54:01,150
Okay, I'm not gonna like always that really we just won the mission. I

443
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,710
I just won the mission

444
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:09,610
We are so far away from this one. I don't better get going

445
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Which way we have a mission?

446
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:24,539
It's the other way. It's like behind you. It's it's as far away from the possibly could be map seems kind of small

447
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:26,539
I wonder if I'm if it opens up later

448
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:31,980
This is one of the islands. I think there might be more than one. Yeah

449
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:38,190
This thing actually fucking moves for a tank. Holy shit

450
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,409
This looks driving way too fast for a tank

451
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,030
tanks

452
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:51,599
Maybe the sense of speed is warped. We're just so used to walking everywhere. They didn't just tell this guy's

453
00:54:56,539 --> 00:54:58,539
1800 this is gonna take so long

454
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:06,579
Are you shooting the machine? Oh, that's a machine gun

455
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:14,579
No, don't shoot that tanks are deceptively fast

456
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,179
I think the only reason why is because there any time you see a tank in like a movie or a TV show

457
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:20,179
it's just going like

458
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,690
Like two miles per hour for some reason you never see tanks moving fast

459
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:39,090
I I did not know there was a person there. Wait, you you moved the thing you hit him with the stick

460
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,539
You turn you turn and aim you're gonna hit sliding the head

461
00:55:48,710 --> 00:56:02,980
She ducked she actually ducked underneath it. No, don't I think you hit a stick sandwich

462
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:20,119
It's not you don't run into the road get out of here get out of here get out get out move

463
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:28,840
this is like when you spawn in the tank in GTA like

464
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,840
like battlefield now, I

465
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:39,139
Wouldn't surprise if you'd like turned around. It was like just for like green like player number like usernames

466
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,349
You heard a drive

467
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:58,750
every time

468
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:07,250
Now they're gonna just back off into a ravine you you killed that guy that was you that did that

469
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,550
Everything is so loud

470
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,389
Would I kill?

471
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:20,309
Your killing them. I why am I getting dude? You're you're doing dishonorable kills while we're in the same party

472
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:22,309
I'm getting negative points because of that

473
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:28,469
We're here to liberate the island. Okay, we use some unconventional means. We're trying to free the people

474
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,059
What

475
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:34,940
Necessary sacrifice. This is so loud. I

476
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:45,750
Can't hear anything besides tank sounds. Did they try to spike strip us didn't work

477
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:56,260
I'm trying to do the thing that I used to do in TF2 or I would just load into like bad water

478
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,860
come out of the spawn and just

479
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:04,300
Aim the huntsman and just shoot it into the air and hope to God that I hit somebody in the head

480
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,300
I think every single person

481
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,380
Cod like

482
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,260
Throwing nice beginning of match. Yeah

483
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:16,400
And the thing is it sucks because in like 10 plus years that I played TF2 the hundreds of hours

484
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,199
I probably played Huntsman sniper it never happened. It was that's just disappointing

485
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,159
You think that maybe once in like 5,000 10,000 chances it would work

486
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,599
I mean, that's that's why it took so long to record the videos

487
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:39,769
All right, so what are we doing here secure gasoline two poles glamour to be we got to secure the gasoline

488
00:58:40,369 --> 00:58:48,309
Really? This is gonna stop a tank a

489
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,960
fucking parking garage

490
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,690
little strip

491
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,489
I

492
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:03,480
Told you this is we're way over prepared for the second mission of the game. Oh

493
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,360
I think it's both the gas station. I think it's blue gas station

494
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,300
I'm just letting you go first

495
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,340
Alright, don't blow up those tanks

496
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,829
To cure fuel. Alright, we need to secure this bill. I'm gonna get out

497
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:20,019
Pardon me

498
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:24,679
That wasn't me that that I haven't done a thing

499
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:33,550
You just got killed on by the actual regular guys after after getting up on a soapbox and saying how over prepared we were

500
00:59:33,969 --> 00:59:38,570
Hold on. I'm gonna come save him. I would be careful. I'm probably gonna spawn in but in your car

501
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:48,110
Yeah, I don't think you can get me nice. All right

502
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:56,320
So security the gas

503
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:08,039
I said one slow motion. Right? Yeah, did you go slow mo? Um, I just killed that guy. I know

504
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:15,599
Oh, it was the last it was the last guy. Nice. We got it job

505
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:21,440
Excuse me

506
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,400
No, excuse me. No alarms sounded like how the radio every single time is like, okay

507
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,280
So what you're gonna want to do is get up on a like high place use your camera spot as many enemies as you can

508
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,300
I'm trying to stay in stealth. I was coming to tanks

509
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:42,039
Yeah, it said we've didn't sound an alarm we were the alarm

510
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,570
Okay, overcome the regime to become stronger

511
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:56,829
Stay in the tanks for the whole game. That's kind of no, that's kind of boring. I want to fly around like helicopters on

512
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:06,920
I'm ready for my new toy. Excuse me developers

513
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,360
Look at how spoiled we really are

514
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:18,679
The tank was fun to drive around a tank and shoot stuff, but I want something else done with this thing. I'm done with it

515
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:25,650
Yeah, I want I want I want a helicopter that can go on the water

516
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:31,199
That shoots missiles out the front and I want to be able to flat fast travel with it

517
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,239
I want to fly and I wanted to go into ground to how come there's no subterranean shit in Far Cry. I'm bored

518
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,280
I'm bored

519
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,630
I see what you're doing. I saw that

520
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:59,000
That guy is now yeah, you fired you fired guns of his doing on the motorcycle now he's going very fast to get away from you

521
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:24,489
I'm kind of wedged. Oh nice. Thank you. Why would you drive directly into this? Don't you think it hit the brakes? Oh my god

522
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:29,679
Did you do that? You did? Yes, you did

523
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:36,360
Okay, the alligators are cool and shit like them, but what what the hell what are they doing here?

524
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,679
Why are they here? This is like no reason for them to be out here right now. I don't know everybody

525
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:46,559
Let's stay home. They've run. They don't they don't get in the car. They just run behind us

526
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:53,579
That seems just so strange. It shouldn't happen. What the hell's going on here?

527
01:02:54,099 --> 01:03:03,739
Who is that? It's like it's like a random event. Okay, I think we need to save this guy

528
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:06,679
I

529
01:03:09,739 --> 01:03:16,179
Don't I know what you get that I'll get that away. I see what you were doing. I'm not doing any

530
01:03:16,179 --> 01:03:22,139
I'm just yes, you are yeah observing with a with your gun. Okay, look at the clouds. Oh, they're so beautiful

531
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:28,010
What's he doing? Oh, he's taking the gun. All right night. Can we hang out? Let me hang out this good

532
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:30,010
I see you what?

533
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:42,940
Bad guy, this is bad guy. That was a bad. I mean, he's a good guy. I

534
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:49,070
See you I kind of I want to can this guy be getting the tank with us

535
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:54,480
See if you can like can you recruit people in like park ride 5? It looks like he's kind of with us

536
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,320
Maybe it was because he picked up a gun if he follows you

537
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,860
Here I go, oh

538
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:09,340
Did you wait that was you I have I okay is it if you hit right?

539
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,179
I said I know it's one HP

540
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:14,739
But if you hit right-click does it fire the machine gun till you hit right-click again?

541
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:18,130
All right. No, you just hold the button down. Let's I

542
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:23,010
It's toggle because right-click is toggle for me that includes this

543
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:29,750
Apparently for some reasons is aimed on sites. It's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not this is firing

544
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,429
It's not but in the game it is. All right, does he follow us?

545
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:38,309
You killed him. I didn't I didn't he's alive. Why did you assume he's dead? I don't know cuz I saw an explosion

546
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:48,699
That guy is a bad guy. I don't know. They just rammed into me with a horse at night

547
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:54,300
I don't think that's a bad guy. I don't know what he's did he say. Sorry

548
01:04:55,019 --> 01:05:06,860
Where's he going? I feel like we kind of need to see these this guy's story how it plays out

549
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
He's gonna have a real short one

550
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:20,590
All right, where is he? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? He just run him over

551
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:23,829
No, he's right here. That's not him

552
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,190
Who's this guy? That's not him. That's the that's a different guy. Oh

553
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:34,219
That's a different guy. Where'd I friend go?

554
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:42,280
He D. No, he's right here. All right, let's walk. I want to see what this guy goes. We have to see how this plays up

555
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:55,750
What's he doing? I don't know. Maybe we can't maybe he's not gonna do anything. Why is he down here? I don't know

556
01:05:56,349 --> 01:06:07,500
Guapos in the way. Yeah, I'm trying to move him. Wait. He's found a thing. Do you play it found a place to go?

557
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:19,469
No, I think I think we've lost this guy's not gonna do anything

558
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,650
Wait, so we expect way too much from this guy. I mean we kind of do

559
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:29,420
Can you like I don't think we can like tell him to come with us. I almost killed him. I saw the knife

560
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:42,219
Yeah, that was scary. I don't know. Maybe if we just give him some space he'll wander back to the road. No, I

561
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:51,389
Wait, he sees something. He does. Yeah, something sees us

562
01:06:51,909 --> 01:07:10,039
Move your guapo. Are you going up? I don't see anything so far. Oh, there's a guy over there

563
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:28,730
Wait, I hear something that you all right is you okay. All right good

564
01:07:37,409 --> 01:07:51,099
I'm just making sure the road was clear. I can't kill him. He's

565
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,610
Yeah, you can't kill anybody with baseballs

566
01:07:54,929 --> 01:08:08,500
Excuse me. All right, he'll be fine. Let's go. I'm trying so hard not to snipe him with the tank. Oh do it

567
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:14,130
He might show up later your play resonate before it's like a telltale moment

568
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:18,449
and when you like rescue the you rescue the dog and they're like in the first 10 minutes of the game and

569
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,289
Then spoil this for as an evil for whatever who cares games like 15 years old

What oh you I want to like be in the same tank and be free. Oh, yeah, that's that's fine

575
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:09,289

01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:16,529
In this work. I was the next mission returned if we got to go back to the camp. Is it marked?

577
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:21,090

578
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:31,180
Good. Yeah, I'm good. What? Okay. You're just oddly quiet

579
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:51,029
Something is very loud. It's okay. We're friends. We just have a quiet road trip. I said, what are you gonna be for Halloween?

580
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:55,189

583
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,510
I'm just gonna be like a

584
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:32,270
Squid. All right, that's cool. Hey, wait, we have a we have something going on over here. What you're gonna wait

585
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,840
I'm a I am in a tank

586
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,079
True that's true. Is this guy see me?

587
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,670
I can't move

588
01:10:49,069 --> 01:10:54,180
Why was he about it looked like he was about to be like a ranger? Oh

589
01:10:54,899 --> 01:10:59,300
Yeah, I'll be eating you if I didn't anymore he's about to do like the nemesis system thing

590
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,300
He just like everything froze and it just looked at him

591
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,060
You got it. Oh shit. All right, we're gonna get a gun

592
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:32,010
Crisis of birth. Oh, you know, at least it's well gotta be crap. That's it. Whoa. All right. Let's get a Jeep tanks

593
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,489

01:11:35,489 --> 01:11:36,529
dude

595
01:11:36,529 --> 01:11:38,529
Can we get the person we just rescued in here?

596
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:45,090
Game's not fun unless there's always a nemesis guy to come up with like we've had

597
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,529
free stinking dies

598
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:53,329
Am I right? Yeah, it's only it's only funny when you get

599
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:58,590
What's happening?

600
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:08,850
That guy's blew his tires why he blows tires

601
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:19,739
And she I don't want to hit her I can't move can she get in hey

602
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:28,560
I see them. Well, how do I hunt the horn? It's G

603
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:36,510
Can we get their crocs in the back seat? Oh, I guess I guess they don't they can't jump in the back. That's kind of weird

604
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:46,430
Are you going turning around?

605
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:52,420
Okay. Oh my god. What is what is this?

606
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:56,659
It's an anti-tank is it underwater fucking landmine

607
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,300
What the hell why oh my god?

608
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:04,220
But it is D day in case in case somebody tries to invade this little beach inlet

609
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:15,109
They better not be another one right here. All right heading up this way

610
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,550
We might have to get out and climb

611
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:24,149
Why would we it's a fact like it's right here. I with I can't I can't drive up there. I don't think

612
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,630
It's it's Claris. Oh, yeah, we're going back to the camp

613
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:47,329
Maybe they'll give us a toy. I hope so if they don't I'm going to cry in the middle of the toy aisle

614
01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:51,699
Oh, I thought that was an animal. No, just a bag

615
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:59,470
They use Zonk right now. No

616
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,819
Why should I be?

617
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:14,229
Here we go. So

618
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:19,460
We skipping the cutscene or are we gonna watch because I don't know I will try to skip it

619
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:41,020
How do you skip it? Um, I don't think we can it's just a black screen. Yeah, this is black screen the fire

620
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,649
Oh, there we go

621
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:47,369
Cinematic with partner, okay

622
01:14:49,609 --> 01:14:57,159
We are the worst like we really are what's the point of like what what's the point of us playing this I mean

623
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:02,060
We get to the gameplay. Okay, I just drive around cinematic trailers. Okay get to

624
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:08,779
Gameplay, am I right gamers? I mean, we're just just driving and running people over the cars and I throw grenades and stuff

625
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:16,020
I guess that's fun, right? It's fun. Just kind of ride around and just drive around and ride around and drive around

626
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:23,789
Whatever I was saying. All right, let's go. No, we have to get a mission. Oh shit. We probably shouldn't have skipped that

627
01:15:28,409 --> 01:15:33,609
New toy they heard you the developers are listening

628
01:15:35,569 --> 01:15:45,189
I'll make sure my fiery corpse comes down on you. Okay, I'm gonna put on like different clothes because I feel like I should be doing

629
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:49,770
That right. Do we have different clothes? I think so. Yeah, you have gear. We've gotten some stuff

630
01:15:50,189 --> 01:15:58,250
We've like new weapons. Don't we I have a watch. I have a sniper rifle. I'm putting this thing on

631
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:19,819
Okay, how's the sniper if I want air support? I'll have to blow it up. All right, we need to uh, there we go

632
01:16:19,819 --> 01:16:27,619
Hmm look like oh shit. Okay, I zoom in

633
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,619
Really was it what's the point of having a scope?

634
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:40,170
Yes, you saw it too. It's basically just

635
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:45,060
it's like when it's like when people play shooters that don't have cross airs and

636
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:52,069
You just tape where the center of the screen is like on the middle of your monitor so that you know

637
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,510
Where to hit fire?

638
01:16:55,470 --> 01:17:00,069
New photos, what are they? Okay, cool. So we have to destroy the

639
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:09,279
Sam site there are a bunch of horses here

640
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:15,279
We say we can't ride these if they got a saddle on them you can yeah, these are not wild

641
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:18,479
That's how you tell the difference from this with a tame horse in a wild horse

642
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:26,380
I don't know if you knew this but if you see like horses in nature, they don't come prepped with leather saddles

643
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:32,640
Um, I don't other equipment. I don't have I don't have the ability to go on. Hey, can you climb it?

644
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:35,140
Why can I not do that? I don't worry

645
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,979
I'm a friend. All right, so we're gonna get that on the map. Where is it over there?

646
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:50,760
We have to go destroy this shit just like okay, when did far cry become just cause when they made six of them

647
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,119
Hey, we got to go over here and like blow this up. Hold on. We gotta go over there and blow that up

648
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:10,199
New mission. What are we? What are you blowing up? So is there a difference between I mean, it's like not really

649
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,579
This horse is in this one

650
01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:19,520
Let's go

651
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:27,800
Do you think that the reason why they keep making far cry games because all the far cry games are independent of each other, right?

652
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:33,729
You think the reason is because they don't if they came out with this game and it was called like

653
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:40,409
Into the abyss or something right and it was not a fire crap far cry game people would be like this is just a far cry game

654
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:44,649
What the fuck are you doing? Like what is this game them numbering these far cry games?

655
01:18:44,649 --> 01:18:48,489
I think gives them some leeway where it's just hey, it's just another far cry game. Don't worry

656
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:52,939
They don't have to explain like why it's so similar. How do you fish?

657
01:18:53,500 --> 01:19:01,300
We have fishing rod as a reward. It's a known brand. Yeah, they can't make this another game

658
01:19:01,859 --> 01:19:10,949
Be nice horse. How do you fish? I don't know. We got a fishing rod. Yeah

659
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:20,350
Well, there's like a spot right here on the weapon wheel. Oh shit. Oh, nice. There it is

660
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:30,829
Okay, look for fishing spots each has opened the tackle box to equip the right fishing gear the right fish and then cast the line

661
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:48,119
I would toy the tackle box. I didn't get the horse with that, right? Okay. All right tackle box

662
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:50,619
What are we looking for? We're looking for fish

663
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,819
Okay, let's put on a um, I don't think you actually have to change anything cuz we don't have anything

664
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:13,180
Yeah, we don't have anything. I'm gonna have to have one. I don't I don't want to catch the alligator

665
01:20:13,779 --> 01:20:17,250
Cast it like okay. See there's a fish right there

666
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:26,270
All right

667
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:32,680
Okay, I got one take it out

668
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:39,159
Do you yeah, you have to actually catch it though. Hang on. I'm gonna catch yours. No get out of here

669
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,319
Doesn't look like you have one to me. I do it's just like I don't know. I'm trying to reel it in

670
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:53,649
I'm holding right right trigger. I know it's it's right click. Whatever. Come on. Get over here. Hey

671
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,390
You snap the line fuck

672
01:20:58,210 --> 01:21:14,970
Fish I got one. Wait, is it toggled? Is that the problem? Is that all right, please don't tell me that's it's not the problem

673
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,489
Is it cuz I have a toggled?

674
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:29,250
He's holding right click permanently. You might be no no way, right? Yep. That's what's happening toggle fishing

675
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:37,439
It's freaking me out because like it's such a far. How far can you cast the line?

676
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,479
No way. Nobody's gonna do it that far

677
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:55,949
How do you okay? Like I got another one, but I got I see that see the lightning. Yeah, I saw the lightning

678
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:00,850
How do you get them to actually bite? You got to like lure him in you got to like kind of wait

679
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:02,850
They'll come over you'll see a little bit of water

680
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:07,489
Yeah, and then can we get okay? I'm done. This is I fucking hate. This is stupid

681
01:22:07,649 --> 01:22:11,289
I'm fucking done with this stupid ass god damn minigame. It sucks. Put it away. I'm done

682
01:22:13,569 --> 01:22:15,569
I'm done. I don't do this. Oh

683
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:27,140
What a flop

684
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,140
He struck my lightning speech you give I

685
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:35,420
Can't put the fishing pole away. I know yeah, I think you have to go into your like actual inventory and like it holds queue

686
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:39,920
Like me once we blasted through Castillo's blockade

687
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:47,579
Well neat neither of us catch the fear no, but it's all right you have to um, however the level of skill up

688
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,710
What are they gonna make like gamer mouse that has rumble? Oh

689
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:56,140
That would be awful

690
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:00,750
Do you hold desk would vibrate?

691
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:03,270
It would just be like I

692
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:08,640
Would shake into your arm and it would shake all through your desk and your monitors

693
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:12,399
That's why I can't tell when I caught a fish because it was like I couldn't tell the difference between a nibble and bike

694
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:22,199
Hey, I need rumble on my mouse. We have to blow this stuff up. I still legitimately don't know how to put this fishing route away

695
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:28,819
Yeah, here we go you hold Q. All right, so we have to be careful because we're we're about to um, I

696
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:36,510
Don't know if that person sees us or I don't I think that person is hot. Is this hot? No, this is our car. Oh

697
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:39,569
I was wondering what the hell they were doing

698
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:45,010
They just like they just like drop the car

699
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,010
In front

700
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,970
Okay, this was a

701
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:57,239
Do you have anything this guy just has a hat and like a t-shirt and like boots

702
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:01,119
We need to get this guy like a weapon. He's in the middle of like a car. All right, where are you going?

703
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:14,399
That's my chance. I need uh, I need help. I need a hero

704
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:34,279
Dude, thanks work. All right, let's go. We have to destroy that with explosives. You see this guy. I heard that guy

705
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:42,010
You look I'm gonna lean out and snipe. It's out of here

706
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:48,039
What's the what are we even supposed to do to destroy the um, like the big auntie? Uh, oh

707
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:58,699
I shot that guy to another dimension, dude. I had to throw that guy in his right ear. So hard. There's pull them

708
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:04,119
Okay, we got one. Oh my god

709
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,050
Put out fire what's five

710
01:25:16,789 --> 01:25:18,960
This guy is yours

711
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,279
I got to revive the croc

712
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:27,600
What do you imagine you get burnt and you're like, oh should I know duct tape that'll do it?

713
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:31,239
Have you ever seen duct tape burn before?

714
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:43,810

716
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:49,600
Could be a toy in here. That's right. There's loot

717
01:25:50,199 --> 01:26:00,619

718
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:08,140
Probably, okay 500 meters that way. How about

719
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:24,520
We need a boat. I feel like if we swim I'm gonna get you down there. You doomed what?

720
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,350

01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,500

754
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:27,180
No, but like I was still on my face in like eight inch water

755
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:31,939
Maybe I hope you had fun out there. It looked it looked pleasant. It's fun

756
01:30:32,539 --> 01:30:47,500
Shoot the light out of the lighthouse

757

Wild pigs. Oh my god. Yeah, I don't wanna like kill them. I just drinking a cigar. I just like drank a cigar. What was that?

01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:11,229
They just killed Guapo what you let them do this

760
01:31:12,109 --> 01:31:27,229
Could they okay Guapo this little pound the bag. Did you say we should shoot the light out?

761
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:37,789
Yeah, shoot the light out of life. I can't tell this drop on bullets. I saw it done in one of the trailers

762
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:41,409
Just keep shooting. He's ready. Should I actually do there?

763
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:53,149
I'm close to Castillo ships

764
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,270
I want to hear

765
01:32:02,109 --> 01:32:04,109
the ships

766
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:08,989
Like the thon

767
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,020
Okay, I love this comment

768
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:23,979
What he said

769
01:32:23,979 --> 01:32:26,420
It's the house from the gamma

770
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:31,659
Correction screen and I know exactly what you're talking about

771
01:32:31,939 --> 01:32:38,920
You know, you know what you get that right like adjust the brightness until you can see this but you can't see that

772
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:46,199
Yeah, it is the gamma correction screen. Why would you even catch that? What how much perceptive are you? It's crazy

773
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:54,140
There's a death. I

774
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:59,590
Shoot somebody from here. All right, we got to go up to the top of the lighthouse thing

775
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:14,439
Wait a second, but I love that like Far Cry became so famous for jumping puzzles

776
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,239
For tall things that they're like, yeah, fuck it. Let's just have them climb a rope to the top like

777
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:23,680
Just skip everything. No more climbing just pull

778
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,250
We don't have time for these puzzles anymore

779
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:43,779
Okay, I thought this is a bad guy look before you leap all right clear the ship of both clear both ships

780
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:54,899
If Lita was here, I'd kick her ass for keeping your secret. We have to parachute over

781
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:57,300
We I was gonna just snipe them

782
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:03,260
You want me to try to give you support over to watch?

783
01:34:03,619 --> 01:34:08,899
I already I already did a stealth mission you it's your turn. You want me to do the stealth mission part. I

784
01:34:09,659 --> 01:34:12,140
Mean dude, whatever. However, you want to do it? Okay, I'll try

785
01:34:12,819 --> 01:34:21,060
You have a sniper rifle. I've got um, okay. Okay, I can like mark waypoints for you. Okay, so

786
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:24,939
Yeah, I'm gonna try to stealth over there. So we have to clear both ships

787
01:34:26,859 --> 01:34:30,539
Yeah, just do one though. You don't have to do both. I'll come over after you to the closest one

788
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:39,079
I don't think this I don't think this is enough

789
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,710
Are you hoping W yes

790
01:34:51,239 --> 01:34:55,560
Like I think it's okay because it's a thing to get up over here

791
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:09,069
Poggle parachute if I'm not gonna attack my shark, that's all I care about. I didn't see anybody on the first boat

792
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:12,390
There's a camera. There's a guy right here

793
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:25,100
Ladder I wouldn't go in you. Oh, you found the second ladder. I'm on board

794
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:31,279
And don't be afraid of using their own weapons against them. That's what I was about to do

795
01:35:33,159 --> 01:35:40,199
Okay, you got a good view

796
01:35:40,199 --> 01:35:43,689
Can you see my waypoints?

797
01:35:43,689 --> 01:35:45,779
Okay, those are yours

798
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:49,180
Alright, I'm gonna I don't know if I can kill these guys

Three guys in this little boat courtyard trying to dump the person over the edge. They're coming back

805
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:31,500
I'm trying to throw the guy over the edge. The sun's getting in my eyes. Oh somebody somebody's up top

Guessing the stealth part is over. I hear the alarm. That was over. Oh shit

01:37:07,609 --> 01:37:10,039
The guys have helicopter. You see the helicopter

How we get over the other side? I have a sniper rifle. What am I doing? Yeah, you got a sniper

827
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:34,140
I mean, it's not like it really matters. I think doesn't really go that far

828
01:39:34,699 --> 01:39:41,779
This is seriously what a place like it was just like pub G

829
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:55,210
Two people just fucking shooting and missing over and over again. What happened like okay us sitting here sniping is like a shitty prices

830
01:39:55,569 --> 01:39:58,489
Sequel, okay. Somebody is hitting us from somewhere. I don't know

831
01:39:59,489 --> 01:40:04,880
One dude's shooting RPGs from the lighthouse

832
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,420
He's hitting us

833
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:19,539
Fuck you Danny. He's talking to be talking about us. No, there's still people on this one

834
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:23,390
Did we clear it yet? I

01:40:29,609 --> 01:40:36,029
Think we can parachute out. This is not clear though. It's still somebody on here. Oh, he's over here. I've got a half a power shirt

836
01:40:38,279 --> 01:40:40,279
They forgot to mention that there's about

837
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,479
staff of 150 people per boat

838
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:48,680
There's too many people

839
01:40:50,609 --> 01:40:52,979

01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,500

This is like they hang on hang on hang on. There's actually a boat. Is there a real boat?

847

01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:39,319
my game crashed

871
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:44,760
Did it what's happening? What the fuck is one of the two there's got to be like one guy left

872
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,600
That was okay. That was weird

873
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:59,699
I'm bored

874
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:06,210
Okay, it's okay. Where is this last person? I did it just get it

875
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:19,840
Yeah, we did it both ships clear to soldiers gorilla boats can now escape. Okay, and

876
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:23,909
Maybe we'll get picked up

877
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:31,140
Now you gotta wait for the cool down

878
01:46:41,819 --> 01:46:43,060
Oh

879
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:53,850
I'm alive. Don't worry. What's the joke? How do we get off of this?

880
01:46:58,310 --> 01:47:10,909
Reach Clara's boat. Oh, she's coming. We made it

881
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:23,500
You know one of these times we're gonna do that in the main characters bodies is gonna be lying on the ground. Oh shit

882
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:26,859
boat sequence

883
01:47:26,859 --> 01:47:37,720
Holy shit. We just made it out of there to give you credit Clara fucking did it. We did it, Danny

884
01:47:37,899 --> 01:47:41,619
That was the difference. What's your plan? What did she do? She didn't do shit

885
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:45,020
He came to rescue us for the boat jobs until we could scrape up some money

886
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:53,260
Open a body shop if the Yankee blockade taught us anything. It's how to keep things running when you got nothing. That's the dream

887
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:59,180
Sure, the Yankees might pay you to park their cars or pick their fruit, but you'll never be one of them

888
01:47:59,859 --> 01:48:04,420
The American dream doesn't come in our color. Okay, if we're shitting on dreams

889
01:48:04,819 --> 01:48:08,140
What are you going to do if you win? Who are the people in the boats back here?

890
01:48:08,619 --> 01:48:11,539
The next president won't last six months before they are assassinated

891
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:17,220
Were they on the boat? They're in they're in fisher boats. You ever see Dunkirk? Whoa. Whoa

892
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:20,020
It's a vision Danny, but I'm not as naive look up

893
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:26,079
This revolution will free yada, but won't fix it when we take the capital yada will be burning

894
01:48:26,539 --> 01:48:30,920
Will be civil war factions warlords born back in the sky birds

895
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,100
You just wait till birds get smart enough to do this shit and shape into like a like a middle finger or something

896
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:38,100
Just wait until they get that kind of sentience

897
01:48:42,979 --> 01:48:48,380
That's why we're making drones they're just like birds but you have to do this more control

898
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:51,479
No one would choose this. No, Danny

899
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:59,939
Everyone who follows me who joins Libertad chooses this but you know, there's aren't real birds are drones

900
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:05,890
Fuck you

901
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:11,590
Maybe a fancy apron leave me out of your fantasies Clara. I

902
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:15,279
Want to look forward I don't like looking this way

903
01:49:16,039 --> 01:49:23,340
You don't think that was like the camera where like we're doing like the joke where we're gonna crash and would not looking

904
01:49:24,539 --> 01:49:35,890
I like that one. I know but like I don't I want to be in control of that not her. I think we got imprisoned

905
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,050
Oh

906
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:49,729
This one

907
01:49:54,779 --> 01:50:02,369
Let's watch this one, oh man and a fake it can be hard to see I haven't even seen this actor on screen yet

908
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:03,970
So I kind of want to

909
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:12,020
Understands that loyalty country is key to his survival. Not justice not love not even family

910
01:50:12,659 --> 01:50:16,979
loyalty vision that look on themselves

911
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,939
Fake yarn is love to be the outcasts

912
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:24,829
They are addicted to their surface perversions

913
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:32,909
Chaos lies like wild dogs, but what dogs can be broken. What's the subtitle? What's going on the subtitle and if

914
01:50:33,789 --> 01:50:35,430
dog

915
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:39,029
Refuses like the last line goes to the top just in case you read really slow

916
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:49,989
It's not on the screen right now, it's a lot of words for that sentence

917
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:54,670
You imagine if you didn't like if you would on a different language

918
01:50:54,670 --> 01:51:04,470
You didn't understand it and you thought this is all they said you would think like, oh wow, that's all they said here. Okay, let's see

919
01:51:09,619 --> 01:51:11,800
Somebody's still saying

920
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:24,069
And if a dog refuses to break they will be no more steps and if a dog refuses to break

921
01:51:24,510 --> 01:51:26,510
That's how each one of these is starting

922
01:51:26,510 --> 01:51:33,899
Yeah, like the last words of the last sentence start the next line and if a dog refuses to break

923
01:51:47,569 --> 01:51:52,420
That person's dead, you know what I mean? Like they always do that in movies and TV shows

924
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:56,899
Oh, I'm gonna have the butter the the pistol or the rifle and hit you in the head like 12 times

925
01:51:56,899 --> 01:52:00,029
The person is a club if they're gonna like do that

926
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,399
After I keep my promises Danny you wanted a boat you got a book

927
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:27,079
It's a beautiful. This is the one subterranean missile launching the helicopter boat. Is it really you two are just gonna let me leave

928
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:32,119
Bullshit, you could have sold us out a long time ago. All right, so we get we kind of get what happens

929
01:52:41,930 --> 01:52:43,930
I'm driving the book from back here

930
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:47,939
Yeah, where the engine block is are you trying?

931
01:52:48,579 --> 01:52:54,170
Wait, are you fucking me? Are you actually driving? Are you driving? You're driving. I am you

932
01:52:58,449 --> 01:53:12,010
Military presence increased your horn. I don't think there's a horn. Okay. Well, this was fun, but we'd have to go over here

933
01:53:13,810 --> 01:53:16,850
Don't be okay

934
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:19,890
We're gonna get some you can respawn it a thousand times. It's

935
01:53:21,649 --> 01:53:28,170
Cars respawn. Don't worry, man. They really cut the budget for this far crime. All right, I mean look at this boat

936
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:44,180
Wait, where is this? Yeah, he's just dig

937
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:52,649
Whatever. Wait, let's go over here. Like I swear to God that person is so if I put my mouth to the ground and went like

938
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:56,260
They'd probably hear us and I could be like

939
01:53:57,060 --> 01:54:02,899
I could put my ear on the ground. They could yell it. I mean, that's how they communicated before cell phones. Oh

940
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:14,800
See, it's why this concrete nevermind. All right, let's work

941
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,359
All right, let's work

942
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:25,619
What's the what's the job?

943
01:54:25,619 --> 01:54:30,800
Can you hear this? I don't hear anything. He's only giving the quest to me. Oh

944
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:52,180
I'm just gonna start taking stuff. Whatever. He said before we can do the next mission

945
01:54:52,180 --> 01:55:01,300
We need to have the achievements for beating Far Cry 5. I'm a weapon too. All right. Look I'll get a new gun here

946
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,659
Let's put it on

947
01:55:02,659 --> 01:55:03,579
attachments

948
01:55:03,579 --> 01:55:11,960
Yeah, it looks good. I want to use this thing. It's what slot is it in?

949
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:16,039
He also said he needs both of us to do the Voss

950
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:20,590
definition of insanity line

951
01:55:20,989 --> 01:55:22,989
This is the definition of insanity

952
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:31,859
Sorry, was that like the Shakespearean interpretation? It was me just saying it to move on and go

953
01:55:31,859 --> 01:55:42,930
Oh, these if we get different supreme. Whoa, what are these weapons EMP pulse to knock over enemies?

954
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:51,329
Chaos by launching poison gas. I don't need to need to hear anything else. That's not that one. What is this one?

955
01:55:51,970 --> 01:55:57,939
Resolve real quick Britain. I don't know what this thing is. I got the gas one

956
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:06,739
Which is a gas coffee? Yeah poison gas. Oh poison gas. Okay

957
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:16,569
Does that just equip no?

958
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:21,319
Resolver I'm like I want to go look out and see what this thing does which which I'll pick a different one

959
01:56:21,319 --> 01:56:23,319
Which one did you get? I got the one that looks like a wrench

960
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:28,880
number two

961
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,880
Okay, without was it

962
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:36,550
Flamethrower. All right. That's the thing. I just got so what's this resolver of weapon? How do we use it?

963
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:49,800
You probably have to like go into the inventory and equip it in the armory

964
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,039
armory

965
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:54,210
Have to equip it. Oh

966
01:56:54,289 --> 01:56:55,569
Arsenal

967
01:56:55,569 --> 01:57:00,140
Like in your actual arsenal. Okay. Yeah, I see

968
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:10,789
What's the other thing do I don't I don't want the flamethrower anymore put this thing on it's a cross

969
01:57:10,789 --> 01:57:15,720
I'm done with you. This might be kind of fun

970
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:20,310
Sounds like the Ubisoft people playing with the ad, you know what? Whatever

971
01:57:21,539 --> 01:57:24,819
I'm gonna be wicked low fucking energy for the rest of stream. You ready? Okay. Ah

972

All right, dude, you ready? Let's go. I don't know you sure. Yeah, you really okay. Let's um, I got this cool thing here

973
01:57:38,029 --> 01:57:39,109
So where we gonna go?

974
01:57:39,109 --> 01:57:45,630
Yeah, actually I'm gonna take a shit for like 30 minutes and then I'm gonna go make some dinner

975
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:49,590
Then I'm gonna take my dog out and then I'm gonna run some errands and then I'll then I'll play co-op with you again

976
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:55,680
I promise. No, I'm good. I'm good. Um, I'll talk to you later, though

977
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:05,649
Like I'll talk to you like at some point. Thanks for playing. All right, we're gonna go over here

978
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,239
My was my chat. I can't see anything

979
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:18,020
Is there any that you can relate to more than?

980
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:23,560
Getting a co-op game with your friend and you guys play at one time and that you never play it again ever

981
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,640
Once you're back, it's every experience ever

982
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:36,949
Ammo new believers because you were surprised. Let's keep it that way. We need to know this. This is important

983
01:58:36,949 --> 01:58:43,989
I still controls all of yada with soldados. I like that. They're all scrapbookers. The capital is a stronghold

984
01:58:43,989 --> 01:58:48,909
It's good to have some hobbies. We free you can do when you're waiting for your friends to log on

985
01:58:48,909 --> 01:58:53,470
So they'll play co-op with you again hit military targets like FND bases and checkpoints

986
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,750
This does look like a

987
01:59:00,029 --> 01:59:05,399
Operations that will unite the revolution and make Libertad stronger to do that

988
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:10,920
I need you to recruit three groups in yada to fight with Libertad each is waging war across

989
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:16,079
What are these subtitles I should turn these off

990
01:59:24,979 --> 01:59:29,579
Poison lifeline you guys get this game. I hope you enjoy these islands

991
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:33,300
Other places

992
01:59:35,539 --> 01:59:40,819
This is the demo we're giving you the demo of the game so you can decide if you want to buy it or not

993
01:59:40,819 --> 01:59:42,819
Because you're not gonna see any of these places

994
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:47,460
Are we going here right now

995
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,100
There's like a leader in each zone

996
01:59:54,399 --> 02:00:00,159
Counter-propaganda campaign and for some reason be like HQ of the resistance is right in the

997
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,720
Was saying this is really confusing

998
02:00:09,319 --> 02:00:13,319
Well, we're not making this any easier. We're skipping every cutscene and run

999
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,840
We're not making it really easy for you to pay attention

1000
02:00:17,399 --> 02:00:22,979
But the Montero family is waging war against Jose they hate visitors

1001
02:00:22,979 --> 02:00:28,260
But I even tell on a mechanic who has a workshop in Costa del Mar his name is Philly Barca

1002
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:33,300
And he's their gatekeeper. Okay, can we get a helicopter and just fly to the leaders?

1003
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:46,680
I'll be here actioning targeted Libertad strikes against Castillo throughout yada

1004
02:00:47,079 --> 02:00:51,810
Hang on. I'm going to get all these groups to sign up to Libertad by myself

1005
02:00:52,449 --> 02:00:59,430
How simple you help we're gonna get a change dot org petition going there's a lot of people we have to go get

1006
02:00:59,470 --> 02:01:06,180
We're gonna get a lot of these. There's a lot of people here. I send a squad to these groups

1007
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:09,579
I'm an invader. I send a scout then I'm not serious with you

1008
02:01:09,659 --> 02:01:16,220
They get my best career without politics and bullshit just help Libertad takes the capital we slid and on throat

1009
02:01:16,220 --> 02:01:31,399
We got a pretty good idea. Oh, I try to walk. I tried to skip earlier. Oh, we have a real boat. Oh

1010
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:35,109
Oh

1011
02:01:35,109 --> 02:01:39,630
Okay, now we're talking now. We're actually are talking meet the legends, okay

1012
02:01:40,229 --> 02:01:48,479
Meet the Monteros. Oh god. This did just open up. All right. We won't go first

1013
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:54,840
Uh, yeah, I think I think we can go wherever extra content now available

1014
02:01:55,359 --> 02:02:14,180
You can go up down. What do you think? Hold on. I have a new friend Pete the Elbertson's

1015
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:25,319
Where's my new friend? What do you mean new friend? I have a new buddy somewhere

1016
02:02:25,319 --> 02:02:36,130
Oh, we can call for our boats now. Oh, yeah. Okay

1017
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:41,909
Do you want to get in the boat? Just let's go this way. Yeah, what do I have? Okay, hold on

1018
02:02:41,909 --> 02:02:46,829
I did you buy this game because I didn't buy it. I did the like Ubisoft

02:02:47,829 --> 02:02:49,909
subscription thing for like one month I

1020
02:02:51,029 --> 02:02:53,119

1022
02:02:55,479 --> 02:02:59,159
EA play yeah, and apparently it

1023
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,560
Unlocks like every premium thing so hold on but to show you how ridiculous this shit is what hold on

1024
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:10,069
I'm about to do like a sea of thieves cosmetic

1025
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:16,890
You have like a Kano I hold on it hasn't I haven't even finished yet

1026
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:24,510
How much do you hold on I need you to while you're doing that?

1027
02:03:24,510 --> 02:03:28,449
I need you to explain to me very slowly so I can keep up and understand you

1028
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:35,130
You're paying a monthly subscription to Ubisoft to play like three games that come out. No, no, no, you must understand

1029
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:39,949
Dollars so I could play this for one stream and then I'm just gonna unsubscribe

1030
02:03:40,529 --> 02:03:46,010
Before the next month charges me. Okay, but but is that what the service is?

1031
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:54,439
It's to like play Ubisoft games like as a subscription. Yeah, that's that seem that's it. That's impossible

1032
02:03:54,439 --> 02:03:58,229
I don't believe you. That's what I mean. They gave me the super look at my look at my hand

1033
02:03:58,229 --> 02:04:00,850
I have a robot hand. Hold on. Hold on

1034
02:04:02,050 --> 02:04:11,789
What is it doing? No, no behind you what?

1035
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:17,310
It has a QR code around its collar really

1036
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:33,199
So it's $15 a month and you get to play any Ubisoft game you want I guess yeah

1037
02:04:33,199 --> 02:04:37,880
why are you saying it like we're doing a sponsored segment because I'm trying to understand because

1038
02:04:38,439 --> 02:04:46,149
You can get every Ubisoft game that probably ever came out on like sales. Oh, I also apparently unlock like

1039
02:04:47,149 --> 02:04:51,369
New weapons. How many new weapons did I get?

1040
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,260
This really is like use my cheat code

1041
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:02,380
I'm the guy standing behind the person cooking the food in the infomercial going now. Hold on a second Kathy

1042
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:08,220
You're hold on you're telling me that this can cook rice and can cook chicken at the same time. Explain that to me

1043
02:05:08,220 --> 02:05:10,220
I don't understand

1044
02:05:10,539 --> 02:05:18,789
What the okay this game sucks, this is stupid. I hate this. I don't like it anymore. I don't like this game anymore

1045
02:05:18,789 --> 02:05:20,710
I got a Winchester

1046
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:24,970
Get out of here get it with you or with your Ubisoft subscription character

1047
02:05:26,350 --> 02:05:28,350
It's not this stupid not fair. I

1048
02:05:29,149 --> 02:05:36,920
Paid $60 for this game. How much did you pay for it again? Explain it again plated scorpion. This was $15

1049
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:42,000
Yeah, I guess I paid three top four times as much as you did for this game

1050
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:51,579
Okay, but I mean nothing stopping you from getting premium currency and just going ahead and buying it to adding these cosmetic items to your game

1051
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:58,359
What the hell that's you could just pay you could just pay more and then you could unlock them permanently

1052
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:09,680
You were supposed to buy the $200 edition. I am so confused. I didn't think that was a thing

1053
02:06:09,680 --> 02:06:14,840
Is that why they made their own launcher? Is that why they really like leaned into the like the you play connect thing?

1054
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:22,600
That's probably just because steam takes like 20% of the profit on everything but but didn't we did I bought this?

1055
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:24,600
Oh my god, what happened?

1056
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:35,220
Okay, there are two objects in the ocean that could possibly be hit

1057
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:38,779
Yes, and you have hit both of them

1058
02:06:39,939 --> 02:06:47,500
Statistic statistically if you use the whole service area, it's like a zero point zero zero zero one percent chance to hit those boats. I

1059
02:06:48,020 --> 02:06:54,229
Am still so fucking I'm floored by this whole Ubisoft thing. I'm sorry. I just am I

1060
02:06:54,670 --> 02:07:00,760
Mean you could you could probably access the the you play shop in the game. I bet because you couldn't Assassin's Creed

1061
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:06,350
How many games does Ubisoft think they're gonna release I

1062
02:07:08,399 --> 02:07:19,229
Don't I don't know that wasn't even my only costume. I have three how many games is Ubisoft release a year?

1063
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:23,180
three four maybe

1064
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:43,560
The cyberpunk one was pretty this one's gonna make you mad too, but for a different reason

1065
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,300
What are you doing more crazy things now

1066
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:59,659
What you get like a cool I?

1067
02:07:59,739 --> 02:08:06,840
Get I you get like laser cannons and cool costumes and I get like a fucking crossbow that was made out of a toaster

1068
02:08:07,319 --> 02:08:11,920
Okay, let's go

1069
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:20,560
We need a car

1070
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:26,039
Listen, okay. Well, I just want to be clear. We're trying to usurp the government

1071
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:33,279
While also taking part in beautiful capitalism. I don't listen. Look at these look at these beautiful shoes in my watch

1072
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,920
Solid gold

1073
02:08:36,359 --> 02:08:40,239
Let's go

1074
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:48,619
Listen only the capital is gonna come up with this laser gun with magnetic reload. I just put the magazine

1075
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,020
Also that guy doesn't get mad

1076
02:08:54,659 --> 02:08:57,430
Hey, why don't you use your like cool new gun on this guy?

1077
02:08:59,069 --> 02:09:04,369
That's so I did you is it $15 to get loud I just met this lady

1078
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:12,270
Why do I have the option what is happening?

1079
02:09:19,229 --> 02:09:26,100
Why okay, I was so confused your gun is too loud, I don't care how much it cost

1080
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:33,020
Get this lady out here

1081
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:42,960
Get we gotta get with this lady's a fucking menace we gotta get over this wrong person

1082
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:54,750
That's the quest what the hell you're don't I don't like they're too loud

1083
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:59,979
If you paid more money to be louder than me, nobody's louder than me

1084
02:09:59,979 --> 02:10:02,859
I'm one of the loudest most annoying streamers on Twitch. Don't you get it?

1085
02:10:02,859 --> 02:10:06,479
You know, I don't be able to be badly be a little louder than me. Oh, what does this do?

1086
02:10:29,069 --> 02:10:33,390
I don't know. Maybe this is the fact that there was an explosion that happened five feet away from me

1087
02:10:33,909 --> 02:10:37,680
We have to make contact with Philly

1088
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:41,090
Shit

1089
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:44,819
Okay, I'll use pay-to-win Robo dog

1090
02:10:48,060 --> 02:11:07,640
Okay, are you ready? I just like gassed everybody

1091
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:13,079
I don't know. I don't have a I don't have a horse somehow and that may him

1092
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:15,760
Yeah, I want you want to go get a robot one from the fucking store

1093
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,109
It probably is one rockets on its back

1094
02:11:21,149 --> 02:11:23,399
Hold on did I get a super rocket too? I

1095
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:31,000
Think we can probably I think we can take this over

1096
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:39,420
There's a helicopter here dude, we have to take this place out. Let's do this slowly and actually methodically. Let's actually do it

1097
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,420
Okay, really? There's a helicopter right here

1098
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:48,220
Actually sneak and do this correctly. Okay, I'll uh, I'll do some spying

1099
02:11:59,859 --> 02:12:01,859
Sure

1100
02:12:01,859 --> 02:12:12,699
That's quite a climb for and claim this is there anybody up on this tower

1101
02:12:15,079 --> 02:12:21,199
I don't know. There are a couple people it looks pretty open. There's just guy on the roof

1102
02:12:21,699 --> 02:12:23,220
Is there a guy but there's a guy on the roof?

1103
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:26,739
How do I get up on that's not none of the not of that building. There's a guy on the roof

1104
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:29,180
To your right. Let me get up there. Oh

1105
02:12:30,909 --> 02:12:36,180
Okay. Yeah, I don't know that that guy just I don't know this guy's doing but

1106
02:12:36,739 --> 02:12:42,579
You're asking you about shooting somebody on a ladder. Well, that guy wasn't technically on a ladder

1107
02:12:42,979 --> 02:13:05,609
All right, I'm just gonna go over here. I think this they see you getting in the helicopter. I'm gonna try to cover you

1108
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:09,239
It said anti aircraft covers the skies

1109
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:18,189
I'll go up. Oh shit. Don't take a picture with you fucking good. What?

1110
02:13:18,970 --> 02:13:28,600
Good doesn't look like it. Oh

1111
02:13:29,409 --> 02:13:31,409
You're not good

1112
02:13:31,729 --> 02:13:43,239
Damn it. I thought it already blew up. It wasn't exploded yet

1113
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
How did you even get up there?

1114
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:51,000
On the tower, oh you already that was a named guy

1115
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:59,050
You're this is fucked up. What's going on? Um

1116
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:03,640
Hey guapo is down you

1117
02:14:05,060 --> 02:14:07,060
It's guapo didn't pay enough money

1118
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:10,420
I'm having common. I'm going

1119
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:27,010
How do we claim this place we have to go in and like break something or grab something or is it just kill the people?

1120
02:14:27,770 --> 02:14:28,890
I

1121
02:14:28,890 --> 02:14:35,529
Think this is just a random outpost. I think we can actually do something here, right like turn off. Okay, hold on interact

1122
02:14:36,130 --> 02:14:38,310
Here we go. All right access chopper. I

1123
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:44,800
literally pressed Q W P O Q L P O P O Q W 1 2 0 0 5

1124
02:14:45,319 --> 02:14:48,239
That's what I pressed. I didn't I don't even know what in buttons

1125
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:51,720
I just pressed random ones about my password in chat after giving up everything that's happened recently

1126
02:14:53,119 --> 02:14:56,229
It's connecting

1127
02:14:56,229 --> 02:15:05,159
Okay connecting

1128
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:15,739
Alright, is it still connecting? Where's the mouse? Yeah, where's the mouse?

1129
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:18,420
How long is it to connect?

1130
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:31,890
Nobody's coughing in here. All right, let's go through glass. Oh, that's not good. There's a helicopter. I know this is a helicopter

1131
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:36,239
I've been trying to shoot the pilot out. I like hacked this thing, but I don't know if it's doing anything

1132
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,039
It says connected. Oh

1133
02:15:39,279 --> 02:15:45,779
What's down here? I'm gonna blow up the helicopter before I kill this guy

1134
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:49,229
Um, I just went underground

1135
02:15:49,630 --> 02:15:54,109
Wait, where's my pay-to-win sniper?

1136
02:15:54,189 --> 02:16:07,890
It's just things I feel like I'm watching the intro of a TV show. So much shit is on the top left of my screen

1137
02:16:08,649 --> 02:16:15,300
It's as if it's telling me who like made the game and shit. What it looked like. Are you dead? I went like down. I

1138
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:19,100
Like come collecting like military

1139
02:16:19,619 --> 02:16:26,220
Ingredients, I don't know whatever it is. I went down. There's a little building can go in and I went down into the basement

1140
02:16:28,159 --> 02:16:35,260
I can't see it's a lot of stuff a single thing. I think I got everything

1141
02:16:36,340 --> 02:16:39,540
Well, this is down

1142
02:16:41,510 --> 02:16:43,049

1143
02:16:43,049 --> 02:16:48,930
In a are you okay up there? No, no

1144
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:53,770
There's a lot of people

1145
02:16:53,770 --> 02:17:03,549
Wait, I got a bunker key card. Hang on

1146
02:17:03,549 --> 02:17:07,190
It doesn't pop up on my screen that says if I just put my credit card in right now

1147
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:09,190
I can actually buy a revive. I

1148
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:10,590
Wouldn't be surprised

1149
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:13,989
Bunker key card. Come on. They got me something cool here

1150
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:16,950
There's about six people on my corpse

1151
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:25,020
What the fuck I I'm just coming up. I have no idea. There's a seven people on my body

1152
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:42,819
Okay, I got a key card. Oh, you're dead. Okay, I'm helping. Oh my god. All right, you're any missiles or anything heavy

1153
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:59,360
Hey, hey, what happened? Are you okay?

1154
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:04,799
Use the rocket backpack. I don't have that one. I have the gas. Oh

1155
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:11,520
Shit, we're in trouble. There are two helicopters

1156
02:18:11,979 --> 02:18:14,799
Wow

1157
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,540
I don't have any heels left either

1158
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:28,110
What the fuck what ammo? I'm dead. Are you still alive?

1159
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:31,420
moment momentarily

1160
02:18:33,139 --> 02:18:35,139
There's a nice slide

1161
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:48,299
Yep. All right. I just smoked a cigar and put it out on my hand to kill myself. Oh

1162
02:18:52,430 --> 02:19:02,379
I did it. What's happening? Just shut the pilot finally. Oh, you got you got pilot. Nice. I

1163
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:11,760
Knocked the helmet off

1164
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:16,690
No, not Robo dog. All right, I got Robo dog

1165
02:19:30,979 --> 02:19:38,889
All right, but what always what are we doing here? I got like a key card. Did we haven't liberated the place?

1166
02:19:40,809 --> 02:19:42,809
Objective telling you where to go

1167
02:19:43,250 --> 02:20:03,360
Nagging you. Oh, you have to just kill everybody. So where's the anti-air that like shoots the helicopters down?

1168
02:20:03,639 --> 02:20:07,829
I think we just claimed it. Maybe when this cycles back, we'll get access to the helicopter

1169
02:20:10,850 --> 02:20:11,850
helicopter

1170
02:20:11,850 --> 02:20:13,569
Come on, please. Oh

1171
02:20:13,569 --> 02:20:17,469
Yeah, we got it. What do we we did? Oh

1172
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:23,379
Helicopter inbound. Oh

1173
02:20:23,379 --> 02:20:25,379
Hell yeah, finally

1174
02:20:27,819 --> 02:20:31,020
The guilt finally caught up with me you buying more

1175
02:20:33,079 --> 02:20:36,280
No, I've just been using

1176
02:20:36,639 --> 02:20:39,500
I've just been using the ones that I already had

1177
02:20:41,459 --> 02:20:44,180
This is restricted airspace, so we have to get the hell out of here fast

1178
02:20:44,819 --> 02:20:49,700
It's we just captured it. It's ours. Apparently it's not a bear. I guess not

1179
02:20:50,340 --> 02:20:54,010
Wait, can you are you over here? Can you get in here? Yeah, one sec

1180
02:20:54,530 --> 02:21:08,299
Nice. All right, where someone's noticing us. How do you fly?

1181
02:21:09,059 --> 02:21:10,860
We've been seen by

1182
02:21:10,860 --> 02:21:11,940
Nope

1183
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:27,899
Just trying to get out of the airspace. All right. Hell. Yeah, that's kind of sad that our

1184
02:21:28,659 --> 02:21:30,219
guapos are

1185
02:21:30,219 --> 02:21:33,479
They'll catch up running

1186
02:21:33,719 --> 02:21:37,239
All right, let me get the controls here

1187
02:21:39,299 --> 02:21:42,780
So it's just forward back left right and then it's space control

1188
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:51,479
Kate 9000 just died. So I guess they weren't fine. How do I turn? Oh, I have to actually be okay

1189
02:21:51,479 --> 02:22:09,389
I'm gonna get a free look. All right, let's go. Let's fly to the mission. Let's try not to break this

1190
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:17,229
You look you just went to a rave. I do you look like you just went to like Burning Man. I

1191
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:33,010
Don't know why I thought that said e exit vehicle slash freak out I'm gonna try to do this very carefully

1192
02:22:33,610 --> 02:22:36,290
What kind of person works in a place like this? Oh

1193
02:22:42,850 --> 02:22:48,979
I didn't get it landed. Where's he just a fucking lose it

1194
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:56,510
Exactly what I would have done. I like this character

1195
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:13,760
Really said she was seen at the tobacco plantation. All right, let's go. What what happened to the chopper? I don't know

1196
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:19,340
It's apparently gone. It's not to make do with this

1197
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:28,790
If you bring this vehicle to a pickup point, you can call it in whenever you want. I can use can you slash DMCA?

1198
02:23:34,829 --> 02:23:37,959
The plane

1199
02:23:39,719 --> 02:23:49,639
Or on to the next toy, that's all we care about. Oh wow a toy we both get in this

1200
02:23:50,319 --> 02:23:55,239
This is back. You're in the back. You're yeah, you're the pie. I'm facing backwards

1201
02:23:55,719 --> 02:24:02,819
Okay, how do I fly it?

1202
02:24:02,819 --> 02:24:05,299
restricted airspace is on your radar

1203
02:24:06,600 --> 02:24:13,280
Accelerate the accelerate. Yeah, and then pitch. Um, I don't know what that does

1204
02:24:13,879 --> 02:24:18,440
Holy fucking smokes, dude. Are you kidding me?

1205
02:24:19,440 --> 02:24:21,159
We actually just do that

1206
02:24:21,159 --> 02:24:23,159
from a takeoff

1207
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,280
This is a vertical takeoff and landing

1208
02:24:26,959 --> 02:24:31,319
Itch and yaw, what's this? I'm trying

1209
02:24:41,489 --> 02:24:43,489
Now is a plantation

1210
02:24:46,049 --> 02:25:00,950
Press E to shoot who is she after? Oh fuck we're gonna get fired. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry

1211
02:25:12,020 --> 02:25:16,299
I'm sorry. That was it. That was a full-on painful. Yeah, that was a big one

1212
02:25:31,459 --> 02:25:35,370
Yes, I do I am I am Iron Man one. Oh

1213
02:25:38,559 --> 02:25:43,590
My god, that's all it does. Oh, what is that? Oh

1214
02:25:51,739 --> 02:25:53,739
Whose plane is this?

1215
02:26:03,930 --> 02:26:09,000
Okay, I'm out of ammo. We got him. No. Oh

1216
02:26:10,350 --> 02:26:11,870
They're coming back

1217
02:26:11,870 --> 02:26:19,969
What was that?

1218
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:22,450
Hold on. I've got like booby traps

1219
02:26:23,090 --> 02:26:31,680
Plane is just freaking out up there. This plane is freaking me out. I

1220
02:26:33,559 --> 02:26:35,239
Out or something

1221
02:26:35,239 --> 02:26:45,409
Well plane is gone

1222
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:50,559
Plane just did a flip. Okay, we'll get another one planes actually upside down. Well done

1223
02:26:50,559 --> 02:26:59,829
There's a supply drop whoever is in that plane right now is and puked their guts out like five times

1224
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:17,149
It's no way you're gonna keep doing that. So what is this another outpost or just like I think this is another outpost

1225
02:27:17,610 --> 02:27:23,920
This is a good person. I'm pretty sure the laser. Oh

1226
02:27:25,270 --> 02:27:31,329
Okay, I don't know. I thought that was a friendly. It's like a bunker

1227
02:27:31,569 --> 02:27:37,909
No, this is like a little bunker like we probably claim it though. Do we have to destroy stuff?

1228
02:27:37,909 --> 02:27:39,950
didn't the thing said destroy things and you'll I

1229
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:45,950
Swear to god. I was like destroy. I'll try to machete the likes

1230
02:27:48,110 --> 02:27:53,139
That's a good question just break shit

1231
02:27:54,180 --> 02:28:00,840
Clearly looks like we can take this it does but I don't think there's anything here. Oh

1232
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:18,739
That was a UFO. I wasn't even playing guided missile. All right. Well, I guess we have to go over here

1233
02:28:24,739 --> 02:28:27,239
Oh lower it

1234
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:42,510
I'm pulling like glass out of my body. Lower your crock lower your crocodile now

1235
02:28:44,909 --> 02:28:55,979
No guapo

1236
02:28:55,979 --> 02:29:03,170
Are we back in the in the like tobacco field? I gotta get guapo. Yeah, we're back in the tobacco places

1237
02:29:03,569 --> 02:29:07,159
Come on guapo. Wait, who are you?

1238
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:24,059
This person have five hundred thousand help maybe a little overkill

1239
02:29:24,459 --> 02:29:36,540
Yeah, you get over here I'm okay

1240
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:54,479
Well, I was all right. All right guapo. You're good. Where are my other gadgets? There's a really weird sound that just came out of your dog

1241
02:29:55,799 --> 02:30:03,690
It's some like grease in his joints. I bet you he gets struck by lightning

1242
02:30:05,479 --> 02:30:17,190
Nope another helicopter person. I cannot kill. Okay, like I'm in dress pants doing this like

1243
02:30:19,809 --> 02:30:22,879
It's like a thousand dollar suit and you just slide around

1244
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:37,180
Hey, is there like a player three in here because these guys are all already dead

1245
02:30:37,180 --> 02:30:42,270
I feel like we did this already like when we are thanks for burning me with your cool

1246
02:30:43,030 --> 02:30:47,110
Jetpack that will never happen. By the way, there will never be a jetpack

1247
02:30:47,989 --> 02:30:55,500
Ever never gonna happen. Oh, I get to do boosts and you leave a wake of fire behind you that's hurting us

1248
02:30:55,940 --> 02:31:08,799
We talked about like Oh flying cars jetpacks. Nope. No when you add the other axis

1249
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:16,680
Not just left and right but up and down and for you know, they understand how insane that would be if they were flying cars

1250
02:31:20,090 --> 02:31:27,010
People would be able to use the Y & Z axis to pass you on the road, which is in the air

1251
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:36,030
There'd be a car there would be a flying car accident every like there'd be 50,000 flying car accidents every one second

1252
02:31:36,469 --> 02:31:46,020
If you think that that like dick behind you that is just riding your ass while you're going the speed limit on the highway

1253
02:31:46,239 --> 02:31:48,600
If you don't think that the fat guy has a Y & Z axis

1254
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:53,280
He's not gonna fucking crash with this first time he drives that car you get twice as many lanes though

1255
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:58,079
Instead of just horizontal you get vertical lanes. So they got more space. They have more room

1256
02:31:58,639 --> 02:32:01,899
When there's 50,000 cars on the road think of how many cars are in the highway?

1257
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:06,770
Yeah, but it's like are there more people in this timeline or the same amount of people

1258
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:11,010
This same amount of people think about when you drive down the road how many cars you are around?

1259
02:32:11,090 --> 02:32:13,090
Imagine if they could just be anywhere in the sky

1260
02:32:18,360 --> 02:32:22,159
Listen to me that sounds like you're stifling progress people said that about cars to it

1261
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:25,399
They're like, you know, there's so many horses. What if a lot of people added like cars to this?

1262
02:32:25,399 --> 02:32:27,399
They're gonna run over the horses

1263
02:32:27,399 --> 02:32:31,360
We're all still on the same axis though. You're not adding an axis by having a horse to a car

1264
02:32:31,959 --> 02:32:38,549
Hey, they wouldn't they share the same plane

1265
02:32:44,659 --> 02:32:47,219
Skip that skip it now

1266
02:33:00,170 --> 02:33:03,049
Sounds like James Gunn worked hard on this

1267
02:33:04,569 --> 02:33:06,569
Rehired and that's the best he could do

1268
02:33:07,010 --> 02:33:09,010
Circumstances with all the mental anguish. Oh

1269
02:33:10,469 --> 02:33:11,870
Here we go

1270
02:33:11,870 --> 02:33:14,239
fight fight

1271
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:37,450
Well run does

1272
02:33:44,059 --> 02:33:45,780
They're all

1273
02:33:45,780 --> 02:33:53,579
Is the game too loud? I feel like they was excruciatingly loud. It's louder now. I feel like right now. Yeah, it definitely got louder

1274
02:33:54,860 --> 02:34:09,139
I can't aim this gun that far. Why are they attacking this?

1275
02:34:10,899 --> 02:34:15,489
What did you see that?

1276
02:34:15,930 --> 02:34:21,329
No, I was too busy spinning gas over there. What happened? I just traveled like 15 feet for that knife kill like

1277
02:34:23,090 --> 02:34:33,399
Take out the soldiers. All right, there's only I think there's only one more. I think it's still getting loud

1278
02:34:33,799 --> 02:34:45,350
It's that definitely is getting louder. Where's this last person? Oh, here comes a helicopter, of course

1279
02:34:51,649 --> 02:34:53,649
Helicopter coming in

1280
02:34:54,090 --> 02:34:58,530
I'm gonna throw an explosive barrel at the helicopter and you shoot it in nevermind

1281
02:35:00,010 --> 02:35:06,069
Oh, I just put gas out here this guy's taking off. He's like I'm out of here

1282
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:18,120
Did you do that? Yeah, why did the car 15 times? I don't know

1283
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:24,629
Watch out

1284
02:35:24,629 --> 02:35:29,920
Come on. Let me snipe him. Come on

1285
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:39,889
Is it bulletproof? I was thinking earlier. I think it is

1286
02:35:40,350 --> 02:35:44,000
Yeah, this shit's bulletproof. I can't hear

1287
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:18,000
You're gonna land I feel like he's going to land I was he hovering like

1288
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:41,950
What about the mounted guns? Can you aim mount a gun that high? Yes. Whoa. He had more health than the helicopter

1289
02:36:50,409 --> 02:36:52,409
Just lying on the ground

1290
02:37:02,979 --> 02:37:04,979
Shield

1291
02:37:05,100 --> 02:37:10,479
What is this game? Okay, this one's actually not fatal it doesn't work

1292
02:37:12,549 --> 02:37:16,899
I shot right through it. It's a piece of cardboard

1293
02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:30,489
Hold that shield up. I want to see so hold on. Hold on. It doesn't actually work. It does it actually works

1294
02:37:30,809 --> 02:37:35,969
Listen, these are the same developers that made rainbow six, you know all the clips you see on Twitter

1295
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:42,090
It's always the shield guy. He just walks into a room holds the shield up for 30 straight seconds. Everybody laughs

1296
02:37:43,129 --> 02:37:45,129
Josh you feet though

1297
02:37:45,670 --> 02:37:49,149
Hey, remember when like I played rainbow six season. I thought I was gonna like it

1298
02:37:50,979 --> 02:37:59,190
No, I was that might have been like the the game that I would hate the most. I remember rainbow siege

1299
02:38:00,030 --> 02:38:03,670
Rainbow six siege. Why are we saying rainbow siege rainbow six siege in

1300
02:38:04,549 --> 02:38:08,469
Alpha had forced open mic lobbies. Oh, yeah

1301
02:38:09,069 --> 02:38:14,190
That's so bad. You're okay. So everyone who was streaming it you just go into a lobby

1302
02:38:14,190 --> 02:38:18,149
It was like alright, they've got a guy in the next room. Yep. I'm gonna go ahead and put up my shield

1303
02:38:18,149 --> 02:38:20,149
Hey, hey, can we get some grenades in there?

1304
02:38:20,510 --> 02:38:21,709
Ah

1305
02:38:21,709 --> 02:38:26,569
It was actually the Ubisoft trailers. It really was the Ubisoft trailers people just talking

1306
02:38:27,110 --> 02:38:40,379
Yeah, people don't talk when they play co-op games. Usually I don't want people to hear me unrecorded

1307
02:38:40,899 --> 02:38:44,569
I've listened like but back when I would like used to make YouTube videos, right?

1308
02:38:44,850 --> 02:38:48,010
you did you'd record a bunch of stuff for like hours and hours at a time and

1309
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:50,610
I don't know why I do this shit

1310
02:38:50,610 --> 02:38:55,329
But I just go like this when I know when no one's in the room and I'm just alone and like I'm not even aware

1311
02:38:55,329 --> 02:38:57,329
of it, I just go like this like

1312
02:38:59,430 --> 02:39:01,389
I just like sniff

1313
02:39:01,389 --> 02:39:03,909
every like two to three minutes, I'll just do like a

1314
02:39:04,950 --> 02:39:08,809
I don't I don't get it. I don't know why it just happens

1315
02:39:10,879 --> 02:39:17,340
I will listen to whole parts of recordings that were like 20 minutes of silence and beginning like gameplay and you just hear like

1316
02:39:19,989 --> 02:39:22,950
I feel like I'm now I'm sniffing right?

1317
02:39:24,229 --> 02:39:28,750
Yeah, see you just like it you were now on manual sniffing. I

1318
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:32,950
Don't know what it is. It's like maybe it's like breathing in to like get up to

1319
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:37,069
Stable my breath to shoot it something. I don't know. It's like weird

1320
02:39:42,850 --> 02:39:45,450
Yeah, I gotta go in and then it comes out

1321
02:39:49,530 --> 02:39:55,370
No, it's not like an irritation or like I have allergies or something in the room is bothering me or at my stuffy nose

1322
02:39:55,370 --> 02:39:57,370
No, it's just I just make a loud

1323
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:59,770
Inhale noise every like few minutes

1324
02:40:01,409 --> 02:40:04,059
I

1325
02:40:04,059 --> 02:40:06,579
Think is kind of like an echo location for humans

1326
02:40:07,500 --> 02:40:12,659
It's like hey, I'm in this room. I was in your chat right now. I would be doing triple question marks in the chat

1327
02:40:15,219 --> 02:40:22,260
I think everybody's already used to it. It's like it's not it's actually not

1328
02:40:25,239 --> 02:40:27,520
Echolocation sniffing really loud to like

1329
02:40:28,440 --> 02:40:30,440
Yeah, so I let someone know you're coming

1330
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:36,239
So if you're like walking down the hall and you think someone may not know that you're coming it's like, you know, like hey

1331
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:37,879
I'm I'm on my way

1332
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:39,879
Whatever you're doing in here better not be weird

1333
02:40:40,280 --> 02:40:42,559
Better not be weird embarrassing cuz here I come

1334
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:47,799
That's so funny cuz like that's like I have no idea what you're talking

1335
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:55,059
That was I actually he's right. Yeah true. Oh

1336
02:40:57,100 --> 02:40:58,700
That's so funny

1337
02:40:58,700 --> 02:41:04,659
But I can you know part of you probably is that is probably correct is you hear people kind of like

1338
02:41:04,819 --> 02:41:07,940
Mouth breathing and stuff when they're walking or you'll hear like

1339
02:41:11,819 --> 02:41:18,649
So that makes sense, yeah

1340
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:29,360
Just not coming around that Dachshund I saw a doctor there is a doctor in this game with

1341
02:41:31,739 --> 02:41:52,450
Third we are in third person. I'm trying to capitalize on third person. This is a really weird build camp facilities

1342
02:41:53,049 --> 02:42:01,760
Okay, just like they can follow up for frame rates like worse than third person

1343
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,950
I really don't think we're supposed to be in third person. I made contact with the motoros

1344
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:14,149
Well Carlos wants nothing to do with me, but I get along with his daughter. I think she's my way in

1345
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:16,350
You need to understand them

1346
02:42:18,229 --> 02:42:20,229
First step is understanding this camp

1347
02:42:21,790 --> 02:42:24,309
You need to become one of them

1348
02:42:25,590 --> 02:42:30,069
Yes, sorry coming here with my $4,000 suit try not to get my shoes dirty

1349
02:42:30,069 --> 02:42:35,190
Could you guys put me in the right direction to overthrow the revolution? I want the I want the Dachshund pet

1350
02:42:38,780 --> 02:42:40,579
I

1351
02:42:40,579 --> 02:42:45,180
Feel like this would be a really you would have an alligator right here next to like a Dachshund

1352
02:42:45,180 --> 02:42:47,180
This is like seems really bad

1353
02:42:47,340 --> 02:42:51,920
He's he's got a quest. It says who's a good boy. I can't even touch him

1354
02:42:52,719 --> 02:42:57,489
Philly's furry friend fancies a fantastic feast. Look at this perfect little sausage

1355
02:42:57,489 --> 02:43:04,090
I've got to find him a yummy treat a meal fit for a puppy prince on his special day reward a hundred XP

1356
02:43:04,930 --> 02:43:06,930
You shoot me in the head. I

1357
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:15,079
Stuck I don't speak bark amigo. I'm stuck in third person

1358
02:43:15,440 --> 02:43:19,280
Yeah, I'm stuck in third person too. Oh, you still are because I can't interact with anything

1359
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:23,420
This is my world. You're just passing through no

1360
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:40,549
Only in the camp, okay, I love this little thing little wheels

1361
02:43:42,739 --> 02:43:51,770
All right, I guess we're gonna um build a gorilla camp I think you have to do that

1362
02:43:52,250 --> 02:43:55,610
Would you rather have access to a wingsuit and

1363
02:43:57,010 --> 02:44:02,329
Hide out locations for fast travel. Mm-hmm, or

1364
02:44:03,209 --> 02:44:06,610
No, the other one sucks. What is it? You can't just say but you know, yeah

1365
02:44:06,610 --> 02:44:09,450
What if I want that one's a fishing hut and we've already tried that

1366
02:44:11,059 --> 02:44:17,260
Didn't go so well. Mm-hmm, and then visit a cantina and trade animal and fish meat for

1367
02:44:18,100 --> 02:44:26,309
Meals that grant temporary buffs like in that one Capcom game that everybody likes. You're the new face

1368
02:44:26,510 --> 02:44:30,790
Yeah, that's cool. Well, we'll do the um, the wingsuit one. Why would you pick the other one on stream?

1369
02:44:30,909 --> 02:44:33,280
That's like the streamer one. You have to pick that one. Oh

1370
02:44:44,459 --> 02:44:52,579
There are lots of big crocs search for a park west end of Cortina River has a great hunting spot a

1371
02:44:52,979 --> 02:44:57,569
Lot of quests now. Yeah

1372
02:44:58,049 --> 02:45:14,500
There's that's we don't even have the main quest or the side quest. I said mustard here. I don't have mustard on my back

1373
02:45:15,799 --> 02:45:18,170
water

1374
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:24,260
It's a vacuum cleaner that I've turned into a put on reverse and put in your reason to connect into that into a tank

1375
02:45:24,579 --> 02:45:28,139
Which then it goes a little thing that goes into my mouth from the top of that and it's water

1376
02:45:28,139 --> 02:45:30,819
I turn the vacuum on reverse and I can drink it

1377
02:45:36,420 --> 02:45:38,590
I have a leader and recruits

1378
02:45:39,549 --> 02:45:44,620
I'm assigning. Wait a second. Are these passive missions? I think I was what did you do?

1379
02:45:44,620 --> 02:45:46,620
I just walked over here and put us on a cutscene

1380
02:45:46,940 --> 02:45:52,989
Lost tourist listen Carlos, I mean kind of was

1381
02:45:56,790 --> 02:46:04,309
She sent and I don't blame you have no history here again, I we just don't ever

1382
02:46:06,379 --> 02:46:09,780
Any way that we can get right to the fly the plane around is

1383
02:46:13,899 --> 02:46:16,379
What we are doing right now

1384
02:46:16,379 --> 02:46:18,379
In the beginning we talked about like the movie

1385
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:22,540
We keep watching the far cry movie and leaving in the first act and why do we keep watching the movies?

1386
02:46:22,739 --> 02:46:27,180
It's got it's gotten even worse. We are not only leaving in the first act of every far cry movie

1387
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:32,719
We are looking up the Wikipedia page of the movie and just reading the spoilers. We don't even care

1388
02:46:32,739 --> 02:46:38,860
This is how like IGN always has a walkthrough guide every single time a game launches

1389
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:46,020
It's probably just like one guy who skips every single cutscene and rushes through the missions to be the first person to have like the

1390
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:48,420
Google search engine optimization

1391
02:46:49,100 --> 02:46:51,100
like walkthrough page up

1392
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:56,909
You and I are just sitting in the movie theater right now we both have our phones up

1393
02:46:57,430 --> 02:47:03,350
Ten minutes in the movie has gone by we're both on the Wikipedia page for that movie and we're like nudging each other

1394
02:47:03,350 --> 02:47:08,110
Oh, hey, man. Hey and like in like an hour or two, I guess I guess like this main character like dies

1395
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:10,479
Oh, yeah, it's crazy

1396
02:47:10,879 --> 02:47:13,440
And we believe

1397
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:21,969
Then there's the reverse the person who doesn't care about any gameplay and just watches the like cutscene YouTube compilation

1398
02:47:22,850 --> 02:47:26,760
Just to skip through the Lord. Oh, you can do that afterwards

1399
02:47:27,399 --> 02:47:32,159
You're saying it's super loud. So everyone's hearing you

1400
02:47:32,979 --> 02:47:43,670
Yeah, we're broadcasting it. We are broadcasting us sitting in

1401
02:47:45,110 --> 02:47:47,110
Okay, all right

1402
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:53,579
We're broadcasting us sitting in the theater reading the Wikipedia page really loudly and we leave after an hour of the movie

1403
02:48:09,739 --> 02:48:11,860
The horse is too smart won't do it

1404
02:48:12,459 --> 02:48:14,459
You shoot

1405
02:48:17,899 --> 02:48:38,819
Compound over here. How did I miss that? It's impossible. I can't do this fov. It is too low

1406
02:48:39,959 --> 02:48:47,739
Why would you drive a gas truck here?

1407
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:55,120
I guess oh shit. Oh shit. I'm done

1408
02:48:57,530 --> 02:48:59,290
3,000 IQ like

1409
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:02,690
Suicide bomb play I guess they like island would be rid of us

1410
02:49:02,809 --> 02:49:11,319
Just sacrificing two people in a gas tank. That's not smoke the cigar

1411
02:49:12,040 --> 02:49:15,500
Anytime a character in a game smokes a cigar

1412
02:49:16,379 --> 02:49:19,180
Doesn't matter what game it is. You want one? No

1413
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:27,219
What I was going to say is I did

1414
02:49:29,579 --> 02:49:31,579
It's over. I can't say it

1415
02:49:31,700 --> 02:49:33,100
you

1416
02:49:33,100 --> 02:49:36,079
Okay, you know a metal gear solid when you smoke the cigar and you hear the

1417
02:49:36,959 --> 02:49:43,819
I can't I'm not gonna try the bomb there

1418
02:49:50,690 --> 02:49:57,600
Who dropped the smoke made where's what is where's that? Yeah

1419
02:50:03,690 --> 02:50:09,219
Holy shit, but that was what that was a civilian

1420
02:50:10,819 --> 02:50:14,420
They're a combat now, I mean that was very very fine

1421
02:50:32,149 --> 02:50:36,680
Destroy the poison

1422
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:45,239
It's a tank. There's a tank where I need help. He knows Hank. He knows. Where's our tank? Oh

1423
02:50:48,770 --> 02:50:52,680
That's a tank

1424
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:05,780
Eat shit mother fucker. I get him. I don't think so

1425
02:51:06,440 --> 02:51:14,920
Now you now you're doing the same thing. I was doing. All right. Well, he's very clearly he's it right now

1426
02:51:14,920 --> 02:51:18,920
He's like, oh fuck. I can't do anything. You can't can you hijack these? I don't think so

1427
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:21,040
I think this guy homemade with the tank. Yeah

1428
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:24,000
If I stand up will he shoot me in the head?

1429
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:29,559
Yep, well, they shoot me with I want to get shot with this thing though. No, don't blame

1430
02:51:31,909 --> 02:51:36,219
Like Burnham and do shit press V

1431
02:51:46,989 --> 02:51:48,989
Strategy was not to play

1432
02:51:53,459 --> 02:51:59,659
Fell on me he knew he's like, you know, I last I sit here long enough these two fucking dickheads

1433
02:51:59,659 --> 02:52:04,399
They're gonna just die. I heard on the radio what they've been doing

1434
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:14,110
I'm completely safe here. How do you do wingsuit and you

1435
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:16,879
shift

1436
02:52:16,879 --> 02:52:18,079
shift

1437
02:52:18,079 --> 02:52:37,129
Doesn't do anything

1438
02:52:38,250 --> 02:52:40,250
That's how you go

1439
02:52:40,649 --> 02:52:46,319
We're like doing all this really important. We're like liberating all these places. We're doing all this stuff

1440
02:52:46,319 --> 02:52:50,920
We're like and you just hit your head on a wall from the wingsuit. Like why would we even use these?

1441
02:52:51,559 --> 02:52:54,120
What a fucking stupid idea

1442
02:52:55,280 --> 02:52:57,719
frying pan Joe

1443
02:52:58,319 --> 02:53:02,860
I can't deploy a wingsuit. Are you the only one that has it?

1444
02:53:03,899 --> 02:53:08,899
Maybe you can't there's no like shift button. I can't do it. I think you're the only one that has it

1445
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:12,799
You might be able to pick it up at the camp

1446
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:18,159
Well, I try to fly into somebody

1447
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:27,000
If you can fly directly into somebody and just like Superman superhero tackle them I see you engineer

1448
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:38,159
Where'd the people go? There's nobody here. Oh

1449
02:53:40,690 --> 02:53:44,690
Yeah, you gotta you gotta slide tackle you gotta tackle lieutenant Alfonso

1450
02:53:44,690 --> 02:53:52,190
I gotta walk all the way up the hills just to reset the joke. This feels like a YouTube video. Oh

1451
02:53:54,940 --> 02:54:00,530
We've been spotted I do with that information that you need to we've been spotted

1452
02:54:07,989 --> 02:54:11,989
That you freaked that guy out that guy is backing away he's terrified

1453
02:54:12,709 --> 02:54:19,360
He can't believe what you did. I need them to be like standing still

1454
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:22,040
The 10th

1455
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:31,989
Okay, this guy your dog is killing the guy we have to kill. He just completed the mission for us. Where are you?

1456
02:54:35,989 --> 02:54:39,250
It's good because I miss it's not there's no way

1457
02:54:40,889 --> 02:54:42,889
Perfectly still

1458
02:54:43,969 --> 02:54:46,250
This is a guy there's a guy said fuck

1459
02:54:47,090 --> 02:54:55,270
There's a friendly civilian in there fighting for us. What? Yeah, the guy with the blue dot

1460
02:54:56,110 --> 02:54:58,270
Well

1461
02:54:58,270 --> 02:55:00,379
He's dead now

1462
02:55:00,379 --> 02:55:05,549
What did you just throw?

1463
02:55:05,790 --> 02:55:17,239
All right, I need stuff like watching the video and play the actual game here. We did

1464
02:55:27,360 --> 02:55:32,870
I'll be with like one of these mounted guns

1465
02:55:34,229 --> 02:55:36,229
He actually is trying to run you over

1466
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:38,600
Rosie

1467
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:40,600
I'm distracting him. I

1468
02:55:40,840 --> 02:55:42,840
Mean smoke right now. I can't see anything. I

1469
02:55:44,809 --> 02:55:46,290
Need some backup

1470
02:55:46,290 --> 02:56:06,500
No, he's getting closer

1471
02:56:07,819 --> 02:56:24,920
Hey, hey luckily. He forgot he has a forward mounted like explosive their motors somewhere over here if they fight like they have to me

1472
02:56:24,920 --> 02:56:29,899
I think we're supposed to hang out. Hang on. Can we just like hot-swap the backpack to Rockets?

1473
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:33,079
Can you hot like just swap it out? Oh

1474
02:56:33,479 --> 02:56:41,790
Yeah, I have to make him dizzy fucker. What are you talking about?

1475
02:56:42,430 --> 02:56:56,100
Get away from me done. How'd you do that? I just changed back to rocket pack

1476
02:56:57,270 --> 02:57:01,530
Okay, to be careful. My jetpack wasn't doing anything

1477
02:57:02,110 --> 02:57:04,139
Your dog needs help

1478
02:57:04,139 --> 02:57:06,360
Okay

1479
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:11,530
He's fine. He's good. Okay

1480
02:57:15,239 --> 02:57:29,059
Whatever. Oh, yeah, don't shoot the horses. Don't shoot the horses. Why do they just keep walking down this hill?

1481
02:57:29,059 --> 02:57:31,059
I think the alarm raised

1482
02:57:31,059 --> 02:57:38,239
The horses bark. Okay, this is like they've got they've got horses mobility

1483
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,299
Long-range guns. This is like in John Wick

1484
02:57:42,020 --> 02:57:46,500
When all of the enemies are the bad guys for some reason enter like gun food

1485
02:57:46,500 --> 02:57:49,459
Right so that he can disarm them and like throw them to the ground

1486
02:57:50,219 --> 02:57:52,649
And you forgot about the music that place

1487
02:57:53,250 --> 02:57:55,250

02:58:00,409 --> 02:58:05,700
We're gonna move

1489
02:58:18,860 --> 02:58:22,379
We have to destroy the poison containers that's a mission we're on right now

1490
02:58:25,899 --> 02:58:29,459

1491
02:58:33,180 --> 02:58:38,479
Dropping in oh you shooting it. I've sniped him like five times. What the fuck?

1492
02:58:39,420 --> 02:58:41,420
Like I can't be alive

1493
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:48,090
Why do they always get the fun helicopters? What's my dog on fire? Oh

1494
02:58:52,059 --> 02:59:00,100
War crime Andy what what are you talking about? Hey, I'm dying helping

The helicopter did it it's cuz you were shooting the guy parachuting that's it. Oh, oh shit. Oh shit

1497
02:59:23,149 --> 02:59:27,670
Okay, right. You know what if they didn't want to get shot, then they should have teardrop somewhere else

1498
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:29,950
before crime

1499
02:59:29,950 --> 02:59:35,510
Well, I they're poisoning people. I have no defense. I have no defense

1500
02:59:36,030 --> 02:59:44,579
Well, why are we here? I don't know they put us all the way back here

1501
02:59:45,340 --> 02:59:51,780
Were we just at one of the two objectives? Yeah, but we died

1502
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:59,309
Let's say let's take a look at the map for a second because we I feel like we're just running around like morons

1503
02:59:59,670 --> 03:00:06,549
Clear the air. So now the pole now we have to poison his troops. No, wait

1504
03:00:06,549 --> 03:00:10,389
Now he's poisoning his troops is killing us take out the crow

1505
03:00:10,389 --> 03:00:18,020
Yeah, crop dusters yellow tankers fumigators as what we're doing if we take out the anti-air gun, then we can fly which is

1506
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:26,899
Here right next to the oh, I got an idea which one you want to do first

1507
03:00:27,340 --> 03:00:36,190
My idea is driving away wait coming back

1508
03:00:36,590 --> 03:00:52,969
This is the poison trucks. What the fuck? Holy shit. Oh my god

1509
03:00:53,889 --> 03:01:08,489
Okay. Well, we got it. Is this what you wanted? Yeah, are you in the car? No, I'm coming. Alright, so what was your plan?

1510
03:01:08,489 --> 03:01:15,409
I don't it's like put c4 on this and it's like driving in the middle of thing and then go full speed and dive out and blow it

1511
03:01:15,409 --> 03:01:16,329
up

1512
03:01:16,329 --> 03:01:20,040
Do we have c4?

1513
03:01:21,909 --> 03:01:25,309
Not really, but I mean if we could just shoot it fast enough afterward

1514
03:01:25,950 --> 03:01:32,110
Be fine. Oh, couldn't we also just shoot the car and it would explode and do the same thing. That's what I just said

1515
03:01:32,110 --> 03:01:34,110
Yeah, yeah, but we're not when forget about the c4

1516
03:01:34,750 --> 03:01:38,989
Yeah, that's what I that's what I said. Oh, you just said that we have c4 and I just said yeah

1517
03:01:38,989 --> 03:01:41,889
We could just dive out and if we can shoot the car fast enough, then it'll explode

1518
03:01:41,889 --> 03:01:47,129
Oh, I thought you said oh what if we just shoot the car and skip the c4 like it was your own idea

1519
03:01:47,129 --> 03:01:53,090
No, I was I was corroborating your idea because I thought you said that we could get c4 and shoot the c4

1520
03:01:54,090 --> 03:02:00,909
German never listens to the plan. Yeah, that's why they call me the wild car

1521
03:02:01,909 --> 03:02:03,909
That's you crazy stuff like this

1522
03:02:04,350 --> 03:02:07,930
In my friend group, I'm the wild one

1523
03:02:20,979 --> 03:02:24,629
Are you dead? Oh fuck

1524
03:02:33,389 --> 03:02:39,340

We have to take out the crop duster thingies up there

1529
03:03:11,620 --> 03:03:14,879
How are we supposed to actually get rid of that?

1530
03:03:15,280 --> 03:03:35,309
We need our own helicopter. This guy just has such an advantage. I give rockets or something

1531
03:03:35,309 --> 03:03:37,309
I don't have any rockets or anything. No

1532
03:03:37,590 --> 03:03:48,100
We just have to shoot the pilot. I mean you make that sound like that's a simple thing to do. I have this thing

1533
03:03:48,739 --> 03:04:10,059
Damnit going up top. I just popped an entire bottle of pills. Oh

It was going to be pretty close. Yeah, it may have actually rammed into you possibly you just made sure it was gonna happen

1585
03:09:55,510 --> 03:10:03,110
What's the origin of it? It's a guy in the watchtower. He's climbing down to come to us

1586
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:15,479
It was the last thing he's ever saw he ever saw I fucked it up a bad one-liner

03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:23,700
And like they would drink out of the like that like the canteen around like the dog's neck. It was in Beethoven

1679
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:25,700
No, it wasn't in Beethoven. Oh

1680
03:23:30,360 --> 03:23:37,959
It was from Looney Tunes. I don't know. It was from some cartoon or some movie. Oh my god. I'm down again

1681
03:23:37,959 --> 03:23:46,540
I'm so bad at this game. I'm I'm on my way. It was booze to make you feel warmer

1682
03:23:46,860 --> 03:23:58,190
Yeah, well, you know what I'm saying. Pirates of the Caribbean. It was like it was like a flask. Oh shit

1685
03:24:07,370 --> 03:24:18,909
There's another helicopter. I feel like okay, we're doing this so wrong, man. I don't even know it was okay

1686
03:24:20,030 --> 03:24:22,229

03:24:34,700 --> 03:24:39,790
So did like the Looney Tunes just make this shit up. Why do I have that thing?

1689
03:24:39,790 --> 03:24:47,940
Why am I thinking that did you keep bringing me up? I keep dying instantly. It was milk

1690
03:24:48,260 --> 03:25:02,889

03:25:05,690 --> 03:25:11,739
There's a helicopter flying dangerously low to the ground by the way right above you

1693
03:25:12,120 --> 03:25:17,639
You look at sword and shield you look like such an idiot

My pet is down. I hear loud sounds. Oh

1716
03:28:39,209 --> 03:28:50,629
I think we cleared it though. Yeah, I think we're good. I think we can move on to the next one

1717
03:28:51,590 --> 03:28:52,629
Jesus

1718
03:28:52,629 --> 03:29:02,850
Yeah, we gotta get out of here

1719
03:29:02,969 --> 03:29:07,770
Come to me. Oh

1720
03:29:07,889 --> 03:29:11,180
Why would you ever pick the passenger seat is what I'm wondering

1721
03:29:11,739 --> 03:29:14,260
Why would you ever do that? Oh, you're right. Oh

1722
03:29:16,819 --> 03:29:18,420
No, oh

1723
03:29:18,420 --> 03:29:20,420
No, he's turning it to me

1724
03:29:23,629 --> 03:29:26,250
Oh

1725
03:29:26,370 --> 03:29:27,729

1727
03:29:34,729 --> 03:29:36,209
No

1728
03:29:36,209 --> 03:29:37,530
Yeah

1729
03:29:37,530 --> 03:29:40,500
All right. Where's the last one? Yeah. Yes

1730
03:29:42,270 --> 03:30:02,719
That was 400 meters to your right. I can't drive through that. I try I thought I could I know but whatever right we're trespassing

1731
03:30:02,959 --> 03:30:08,110
Oh

1732
03:30:08,110 --> 03:30:22,030
Okay, the turret sinking in this game is better than the battlefield 2042 alpha. Mm-hmm

1733
03:30:23,030 --> 03:30:25,319
It's pretty clean

1734
03:30:25,319 --> 03:30:33,120
Okay, how about we just stay out and just from a distance, right? Why do we have to go in?

1735
03:30:33,799 --> 03:30:35,799
We don't have to go inside

1736
03:30:35,799 --> 03:30:53,200
We're just surrounding ourselves with people. I think that person's shooting a mortar. Ow

1737
03:30:53,840 --> 03:31:00,739
Alright, I'm going it. Why is it fire over here? They just called for backup

1738
03:31:01,379 --> 03:31:15,809
Jesus who is shooting me? It's god. Damn it. I could even I didn't see that guy if I bleed out and you're alive

1739
03:31:15,809 --> 03:31:20,649
I'll just spawn right next to you, right? Oh, wait. Are you hang on? Are you dead? Yeah, but I think I'll just spawn right next to you

1740
03:31:23,459 --> 03:31:29,399
You better believe fast

1741
03:31:29,399 --> 03:31:36,770
Smothered when he said we have you tried playing with you monitor turned on. Oh shit. Hold on. What the fuck? That's right

1742
03:31:36,770 --> 03:31:41,610
I was wondering why I was just sitting there was like a just a glare of like look at my face. Look like a mirror

1743
03:31:41,930 --> 03:31:44,969
Hey, hang on. Are you still on the contrast screen?

1744
03:31:45,610 --> 03:31:50,280
No, no, I just like I didn't have the monitor on I was wondering I was like this looks like me sitting here

1745
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:55,040
Yeah, you have to turn the brightness up enough where you can just barely see the line. Mm-hmm

1746
03:31:55,479 --> 03:32:06,219
Cuz I heard like I heard the sounds and stuff, but I didn't know

1747
03:32:06,860 --> 03:32:18,600
Didn't know where they were coming from. All right, where are we at? How we still not done this because we just died

1748
03:32:18,840 --> 03:32:21,319
We're still on this mission, right? 94%

1749
03:32:22,120 --> 03:32:24,739
We just have to destroy more tobacco things

1750
03:32:25,340 --> 03:32:36,040
Really come on

1751
03:32:36,040 --> 03:32:37,280
99%

1752
03:32:37,280 --> 03:32:55,120
He's telling us to shoot the planes. But what he's not telling us is how what we need better weapons

1753
03:32:55,120 --> 03:32:57,120
We can't just shoot at the planes. We did that already

1754
03:32:57,399 --> 03:33:06,000
Didn't do anything. All right, just look for a yellow barrel. Shoot it harder

1755
03:33:06,520 --> 03:33:15,889
Arrows you craft the right bullets. You need armor piercing rounds for those planes. It's guys fishing

1756
03:33:20,409 --> 03:33:35,100
Okay, I killed that guy and we did it. It's complete. It's done. Did you do it?

1757
03:33:35,299 --> 03:33:37,100
Yeah, apparently

1758
03:33:37,100 --> 03:33:51,840
Someone you chat just said is this game co-op? Um, yes

1759
03:33:52,959 --> 03:33:55,700
We're just but we're both playing single-player at the same time

1760
03:33:56,459 --> 03:34:01,430
We just like talking to each other. This guy's trying to come. I'm just literally waiting in the car for you

1761
03:34:01,430 --> 03:34:06,420
I'm gonna try and make it for you. I didn't do anything and these guys are attacking me

1762
03:34:15,180 --> 03:34:23,420
Yeah, yeah, we just went to like the convenience store and I like didn't feel like getting out of the car

1763
03:34:23,500 --> 03:34:45,690
My phone. Oh my god. Sorry. I bumped you. Wait, what? I just like I punch like the mic. Sorry. I punched the bike

1764
03:34:45,690 --> 03:34:47,690
I think you meant you bumped the car

1765
03:34:48,569 --> 03:34:52,129
And that's why we exploded. All right. Well, we have a main mission over here

1766
03:34:52,129 --> 03:34:58,969
I want to go to like the workbench and look at stuff, right? I don't want to just shoot the same bullets

1767
03:34:58,969 --> 03:35:00,569
I do. Yeah

1768
03:35:00,569 --> 03:35:05,610
Yeah, maybe you should pay premium and you could have all the guns I have to play with I'm not gonna do that

1769
03:35:06,090 --> 03:35:13,840
We can't why did we just clear?

1770
03:35:14,479 --> 03:35:16,719
Why did you put us in a trespassing area?

1771
03:35:17,280 --> 03:35:19,899
It's both it spawned us in the trespass

1772
03:35:29,239 --> 03:35:31,239

1784
03:36:40,409 --> 03:36:45,129
Okay, we didn't even aggro those guys. No, they're just driving by shooting at us

1785
03:36:45,930 --> 03:36:52,319
This is the part of the fucking comedy movie where I go hold on to your seats

1786
03:36:53,120 --> 03:36:57,370
And you close your eyes you cover both eyes with both hands and you go. Oh

1787
03:36:58,329 --> 03:36:59,610
No

1788
03:36:59,610 --> 03:37:01,610
You're gonna you're gonna have to go faster

1789
03:37:03,840 --> 03:37:05,840
Really build up the drama

1790
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:34,120
That uh go differently in your head. Yeah, are you drowning?

1791
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:38,319
But your head just went up all above the water. That's not fair

1792
03:37:39,360 --> 03:37:41,360
Hold on you get air

1793
03:37:46,860 --> 03:37:49,040
I'm gonna live that's not fair

1794
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:51,520
That's unfair

1795
03:37:51,520 --> 03:38:03,290
the best laid jokes

1796
03:38:03,290 --> 03:38:05,610
Why am I i'm sinking further than I think I should be

1797
03:38:06,639 --> 03:38:09,440
This is this deep

1798
03:38:09,440 --> 03:38:13,040
Uh, how deep is this? This is deep fucking water. What's going on?

1799
03:38:14,280 --> 03:38:19,319
Let that be a lesson kids. Okay, don't try and cross real rivers just because it looks shallow

1800
03:38:19,639 --> 03:38:22,520
This river is like 700 feet deep

1801
03:38:23,079 --> 03:38:27,079
Probably died on the oregon trail and in the crusades

1802
03:38:31,100 --> 03:38:36,200
Where are you? I am 5 000 feet underneath this water. Okay that

1803
03:38:37,399 --> 03:38:39,399
Actually, you're right. Let that be a lesson

1804
03:38:40,250 --> 03:38:49,389
You are uh, you just gotta watch dogs. I think that's what happened. Oh deep is this actually

1805
03:38:49,950 --> 03:38:51,629
Okay, so you were under the map

1806
03:38:51,629 --> 03:38:55,229
Yeah, okay. This is literally like five six feet deep. Not even like four feet deep

1807
03:38:56,030 --> 03:38:58,750
That was really weird unless there's this one like giant sinkhole thing

1808
03:39:01,399 --> 03:39:04,120
I think I think what happened was I was still on the back of the buggy

1809
03:39:04,760 --> 03:39:09,000
And you spawned on me, but since I was like facing up behind me was like under

1810
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:11,559
the soil

1811
03:39:11,559 --> 03:39:13,000
Oh, I see

1812
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:23,200
Oh, this is nice

1813
03:39:23,200 --> 03:39:26,000
Don't you dare i'll be very mad at you if you shoot that thing

1814
03:39:27,790 --> 03:39:29,790
Okay, no not that up

1815
03:39:30,940 --> 03:39:32,940
No the goat I

1816
03:39:33,579 --> 03:39:41,600
Don't kill it. Don't kill it

1817
03:39:41,600 --> 03:39:47,049
I don't even see a goat it ran by us and it was cute and this thing just no it's not gonna leave us alone

1818
03:39:48,940 --> 03:39:51,370
Leave us alone

1819
03:39:51,370 --> 03:39:54,059
what

1820
03:39:56,280 --> 03:40:03,239
Where's guapo? Oh shit. Oh, no guapo

1821
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:07,559
What are you doing? Oh my god

1822
03:40:09,850 --> 03:40:16,280
What the hell?

1823
03:40:16,280 --> 03:40:17,629
Oh

1824
03:40:17,629 --> 03:40:21,870
Oh my okay, this is like fucking brutal. I don't like this. I don't like this. I don't like this anymore

1825
03:40:22,190 --> 03:40:24,920
I don't like this anymore

1826
03:40:24,920 --> 03:40:27,319
I don't like this anymore

1827
03:40:27,319 --> 03:40:31,799
They killed my cat

1828
03:40:32,200 --> 03:40:38,969
Holy shit

1829
03:40:38,969 --> 03:40:47,629
Oh, dude, we got some coyote meat. We could probably trade that for a new rocket launcher. That was a death roll. Yeah, that was brutal

1830
03:40:58,219 --> 03:41:00,059
There are people

1831
03:41:00,059 --> 03:41:01,180
out here

1832
03:41:01,180 --> 03:41:03,479
Yeah, that was a road

1833
03:41:06,969 --> 03:41:08,600

1837
03:41:18,559 --> 03:41:22,670
What happened?

1838
03:41:22,670 --> 03:41:28,430
I swear to god every time a lady comes over with an atv the screen explodes. I don't know what's happening here

1839
03:41:30,520 --> 03:41:35,690
It's better if you don't know we actually we need a vehicle. We need something

1840
03:41:46,540 --> 03:41:48,540

1845
03:42:24,280 --> 03:42:28,889
And started honking

1846
03:42:31,290 --> 03:42:33,290

1847
03:42:35,659 --> 03:42:39,959
Yeah, we get keep going we gotta keep we're gonna follow this this is this is like an uh

1848
03:42:40,840 --> 03:42:44,840
We gotta have the camera out for this. I just saw blood. I don't know who's it was

1849
03:42:48,520 --> 03:42:52,809
What is this lady's problem?

1850
03:42:53,049 --> 03:42:55,049
Yarring traffic, am I right?

1851
03:42:58,510 --> 03:43:02,670
Hey, I think it's another atv is for people going faster the speed limit

1852
03:43:13,479 --> 03:43:15,479
Okay, eventually

1853
03:43:15,479 --> 03:43:17,719
Is that blood or mud? I don't know

1854
03:43:19,549 --> 03:43:22,040
What are you looking at the horse?

1855
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:32,280
Oh god

1856
03:43:32,280 --> 03:43:34,280

03:43:38,079 --> 03:43:47,719
There she is her car is smoking

03:43:47,879 --> 03:43:57,739
I'm trying to protect her channel seven news

1859
03:44:05,049 --> 03:44:11,840
Making sure she's okay

1860
03:44:11,840 --> 03:44:15,290
All right

1861
03:44:15,290 --> 03:44:17,290
Did a plane just crash?

1862
03:44:27,020 --> 03:44:29,819
This is i'm feeling i'm holding down the cinematic button in gta

1863
03:44:30,540 --> 03:44:32,540
Why do you keep crashing into shit?

1864
03:44:35,370 --> 03:44:37,500
No, we're gonna lose her

1865
03:44:37,500 --> 03:44:39,500
I just got shot in the head

1866
03:44:42,190 --> 03:44:44,190
Why is it pulling me off the road?

1867
03:44:44,430 --> 03:44:48,190
Oh my god, we are the worst at trailing somebody

1868
03:44:49,149 --> 03:44:56,350
That's how every assassin's creed trailing mission ends they they got it down to his science

1869
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:09,000
Okay

1870
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:10,040
Going well

1871
03:45:10,040 --> 03:45:17,399
This is dash cam footage

1872
03:45:17,799 --> 03:45:19,799
Imagine bringing this to like court

1873
03:45:20,409 --> 03:45:22,569
the amount of insane shit going on

1874
03:45:23,290 --> 03:45:27,450
Judges just put his hands up and be like I don't even I don't know what the fuck is happening in your dash cam

1875
03:45:28,680 --> 03:45:31,639
It was 56 car accidents in 15 seconds

1876
03:45:32,280 --> 03:45:36,280
Who's at fault? Did you have the right away? I have no idea. You're all just going to jail

1877
03:45:36,280 --> 03:45:38,920
I guess I have absolutely no fucking idea what to do with this

1878
03:45:52,409 --> 03:45:54,590
No

1879
03:45:59,579 --> 03:46:01,340
Oh god, no

1880
03:46:01,340 --> 03:46:10,590
He doesn't know oh that hit us. That was a direct hit

1881
03:46:15,159 --> 03:46:17,319
I don't think that was him. Was it him?

1882
03:46:18,399 --> 03:46:20,399
Why is he still driving down the road?

1883
03:46:20,559 --> 03:46:31,559
I gotta get this on camera

1884
03:46:31,559 --> 03:46:37,420
Bye. Okay. Good. Yeah

1885
03:46:38,059 --> 03:46:43,850
Hey, why did it? Okay. So I I was just

1886
03:46:46,989 --> 03:46:52,489
Oh

1887
03:47:19,690 --> 03:47:21,840
Okay

1888
03:47:21,840 --> 03:47:24,719
Oh, i'm just thinking of like this judge looking at this video

1889
03:47:27,229 --> 03:47:30,989
Oh, by the way, I i'm not even sure those cats are legal to own

1890
03:47:31,870 --> 03:47:33,469
Whose cat is that?

1891
03:47:33,469 --> 03:47:36,590
An alligator and his so you get something to roll back. Oh

1892
03:47:37,549 --> 03:47:43,500
This guy's just vibing. Oh

1893
03:47:44,239 --> 03:47:48,159
Why did he i've stood in the road before and no one's ran into me like that

1894
03:47:48,959 --> 03:47:52,590
I'm just sitting there with the camera up and he stroked. He didn't even care

1895
03:47:54,989 --> 03:48:01,879
What are you doing?

1896
03:48:01,879 --> 03:48:03,950
Okay. Um

1897
03:48:03,950 --> 03:48:07,600
Uh-huh. I had a moment there. I'm sorry

1898
03:48:11,549 --> 03:48:16,750
Welcome back. I missed him. Thank you

1899
03:48:19,340 --> 03:48:22,700
What's the mission again? We're okay. We have to go this way. I don't think we have one

1900
03:48:22,700 --> 03:48:24,700
I think we can do whatever we want

1901
03:48:25,479 --> 03:48:27,559
We could just look at the map to go somewhere

1902
03:48:28,440 --> 03:48:30,590
um

1903
03:48:30,590 --> 03:48:32,590
We could just keep fighting in the middle of this

1904
03:48:33,149 --> 03:48:37,069
All right. I'm just gonna is that a good guy? I think that's a good. I think it's a good guy

1905
03:48:41,530 --> 03:48:43,959
Okay. Thanks for the help

1906
03:48:44,040 --> 03:48:46,040
Where are you?

1907
03:48:46,809 --> 03:48:48,250
Where are you on the roof?

1908
03:48:48,250 --> 03:48:50,639
Well, you're on the roof of this car. Okay. Yeah

1909
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:54,559
Can you like open the back door or anything like what happens if you hit x x?

1910
03:48:57,200 --> 03:49:00,239
It's raining though. No, nothing turns them when the windshield wipers are on

1911
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:05,870
You hit the rain button apparently so

1912
03:49:13,069 --> 03:49:15,069
We could do the good boy mission

1913
03:49:15,149 --> 03:49:17,149
Let's think. Oh, okay

1914
03:49:17,229 --> 03:49:19,530
Let's just get back there and see what we can even do

1915
03:49:23,680 --> 03:49:25,680
Uh, let's do

1916
03:49:25,680 --> 03:49:35,850
Oh the the good boy mission is collect crocodile. Oh, okay

1917
03:49:36,489 --> 03:49:38,489
So can you get that mark one marker for us?

1918
03:49:40,729 --> 03:49:42,729
Uh, I think it's like just follows the road

1919
03:49:43,370 --> 03:49:45,370
Okay

1920
03:49:47,930 --> 03:49:49,930
I'm playing paper boy. I don't know what i'm doing

1921
03:49:55,159 --> 03:49:57,159
Does paper boy usually drive a truck?

1922
03:49:58,159 --> 03:49:59,450
I don't know

1923
03:49:59,450 --> 03:50:05,440
Yeah

1924
03:50:05,440 --> 03:50:07,440
Nobody knows what paper boy is

1925
03:50:07,770 --> 03:50:10,729
Yes, they do. Come on. That's like that's what's saying. You don't know what pac-man is

1926
03:50:12,780 --> 03:50:16,540

03:50:28,299 --> 03:50:31,760
Still going this way

1928
03:50:31,760 --> 03:50:36,639
I still think I don't think i'm holy fuck. I must flip that person. Uh, yeah, it's actually behind us now

1929
03:50:39,760 --> 03:50:41,760
Actually, you could just take this road again. Okay

1930
03:50:42,780 --> 03:50:44,299
to the left

1931
03:50:44,299 --> 03:50:50,059

1939
03:51:43,950 --> 03:51:48,360
Where'd the bird go?

03:51:48,360 --> 03:51:54,729
Hey, uh hit up the map fast travel to the big blue. There we go. Much faster

03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,629
but you still can't

1952
03:52:49,469 --> 03:52:55,229
Oh really? Oh shit, but I I ended up like I needed a graphics card

1953
03:52:55,549 --> 03:53:00,059
I've waited and waited and waited and waited and we tried over and over again to get something that wasn't a 30 90

1954
03:53:00,059 --> 03:53:02,059
And it was like all right. Well, I need to get a graphics card

1955
03:53:02,540 --> 03:53:13,239
I don't even care you paid 50 000 for 30 90. No, I did not this is taking a very long time

1956
03:53:13,319 --> 03:53:18,569
I will say though. Yeah, I think it's uh, i'm gonna say game probably crashed in the loading screen

1957
03:53:19,639 --> 03:53:26,700
30 90 but no 1080p stream metallics. I would let you take this one. Would you like to explain that? Um, sure

1958
03:53:27,479 --> 03:53:34,440
See you have to get approved by twitch to have more than six megabit per second up for 1080p to look good

1959
03:53:35,530 --> 03:53:39,610
Why does 1080p not look good at 6 000 up? Could you explain that for the audience, please?

1960
03:53:40,090 --> 03:53:42,090
because bitrate

1961
03:53:42,090 --> 03:53:44,090
sucks and uh

1962
03:53:44,170 --> 03:53:48,489
cox cox the internet but also

1963
03:53:53,690 --> 03:53:55,690
I got error coded. Oh, no

1964
03:53:57,229 --> 03:54:03,319
All right. Well, we have to wait. Hopefully this is script the whole game. Is that gonna mess the game up?

1965
03:54:03,559 --> 03:54:11,020
Oh shit, you host it though, right? So we should do your game

1966
03:54:12,479 --> 03:54:15,520
I am trying to load back in I will never fast travel ever again

1967
03:54:15,680 --> 03:54:21,360
That was the problem, you know, you know how every single video game always says never close your game during like a loading screen

1968
03:54:23,799 --> 03:54:28,569
And our game just crashed during a loading screen. That's a lot of bullshit

1969
03:54:30,040 --> 03:54:34,440
And i'm I press continue to like continue my game and i'm in another loading screen

1970
03:54:35,200 --> 03:54:46,000
I'm just gonna force quit the game. I'm in the process of force quitting. Oh, i'm right. Wait, you got in i'm not

1971
03:54:47,079 --> 03:54:54,780
Yeah, because you have to join me, but i'm still stuck in the loading screen. Oh, yeah, you've got to force quit then

1972
03:54:54,940 --> 03:54:59,200
I'm still hearing the game's audio and the game is force quit

1973
03:55:01,790 --> 03:55:11,129
I'm very upset right now. Why is this the game three people?

1974
03:55:11,450 --> 03:55:20,729
Yeah, there is no ubisoft game open right now and i'm still I still hear the music of the loading menu

1975
03:55:22,120 --> 03:55:26,920
Why does it is it just me or does it sound like i'm like witcher music you still have them?

1976
03:55:27,159 --> 03:55:37,959
This is weird. I've closed everything it says farcar6 is running right now. What? Okay. I need to like give me a sec

1977
03:55:40,909 --> 03:55:42,909
Force quit the application, but it's already closed

1978
03:55:50,329 --> 03:55:54,190
2021 triple a release. Oh megalo. You know what I mean?

1979
03:55:56,440 --> 03:56:08,760
Come back in triple a doesn't exist anymore. What's your favorite game of all time?

1980
03:56:10,620 --> 03:56:17,049
Uh nights of the old republic tied with uh teenage mutant ninja turtles turtles in time, of course, that's good

1981
03:56:17,290 --> 03:56:26,079
It's a good pick. All right

1982
03:56:26,079 --> 03:56:31,440
Uh, I should be ready to be invited momentarily here once this fucking actually open the game

1983
03:56:37,180 --> 03:56:39,180
What's your favorite game of all time besides?

1984
03:56:39,260 --> 03:56:42,540
mario rpg or team fortress

1985
03:56:44,489 --> 03:56:50,190
If I had to say that was a real softball. I mean it is it just is okay

1986
03:56:51,120 --> 03:56:52,639
I gauge how much

1987
03:56:52,639 --> 03:56:56,360
I like a game based on how much time I put into a game. So

1988
03:56:57,000 --> 03:56:58,920
I've put the most time

1989
03:56:58,920 --> 03:57:01,559
Into like team fortress into like world of warcraft

1990
03:57:01,879 --> 03:57:05,799
Although I would say world of warcraft should be on that list up until like wrath of the lich king

1991
03:57:06,360 --> 03:57:10,680
That's it. Wow doesn't exist in my brain really

1992
03:57:11,159 --> 03:57:18,030
Until after wrath of the lich king. All right. I'm ready for an invite if you can

Oh, yeah, sure. Go on. Let's hear it. Oh worst stream of 2021

2010
03:59:20,000 --> 03:59:22,479
No, there's been 10 streams this year. Oh

2011
03:59:26,670 --> 03:59:28,840
That's not true

2012
03:59:28,840 --> 03:59:48,860
That's not true. All right, let's do that. We're doing crocodile meat. These can't be trusted. Okay me

2013
03:59:49,180 --> 03:59:55,819
Yeah, you just fired at that guy. Why did you just just what did you shoot turkey? What is that?

2014
03:59:56,139 --> 04:00:10,430
He was a pelican by the way, he'll be soft. What is going on here? Really? What's wrong with you? My

2015
04:00:10,989 --> 04:00:18,090
Controls got reset. Okay. Well now I have to do this. I have to like disable this again

2016
04:00:18,909 --> 04:00:30,989
You feel like sending me messages. Hold on. Let me turn off notifications

2017
04:00:33,739 --> 04:00:43,149
Oh this fuck. Oh who fucking has that? It was me. Did you leak me? Did you leak me?

2018
04:00:43,309 --> 04:00:49,309
You got listen, oh you leaked me I got some bad news 120 gigabytes of my computer have leaked

2019
04:00:49,709 --> 04:00:51,770
onto the bit torrent

2020
04:00:51,770 --> 04:00:54,889
No, you don't no. No, I don't know. No, no more leaks

2021
04:01:00,299 --> 04:01:11,920
All right. I'm ready, but no when I try to invite you from the in-game menu it popped up

2022
04:01:12,639 --> 04:01:14,670
Oh, I don't care

2023
04:01:14,670 --> 04:01:28,620
Uh, I don't care. It's it's my epic games launcher account. I'm not i'm not concerned about it. Fuck you, bro

2024
04:01:32,329 --> 04:01:34,889
Listen, I think we can all just blame ubisoft

2025
04:01:36,809 --> 04:01:42,959
Can see their shitty overlay inside games well you can you can actually blame ubisoft for

2026
04:01:44,399 --> 04:01:47,850
Having ubisoft connect in the first place

2027
04:01:47,850 --> 04:01:48,090
All right

2028
04:01:48,090 --> 04:01:51,129
So we don't fast travel but we have to go all the way down here

2029
04:01:53,229 --> 04:02:06,139
I haven't mocked so like getting in the car and like turning the radio off

2030
04:02:06,700 --> 04:02:08,059
feels like

2031
04:02:08,059 --> 04:02:13,420
Getting an uber on quiet mode like they're like jamming out in the car. But then since you asked for like silence

2032
04:02:14,219 --> 04:02:16,219
They pick you up and they turn it off

2033
04:02:29,920 --> 04:02:31,920
That's an option yeah

2034
04:02:33,950 --> 04:02:35,149
although

2035
04:02:35,149 --> 04:02:39,229
Sometimes you will pick that option and they probably just don't even like

2036
04:02:41,389 --> 04:02:55,049
Okay. Um, just trying to did you get out? No, I mean i'm here. I'm just watching. Who's the blip on the map?

2037
04:02:58,540 --> 04:02:59,739
um

2038
04:02:59,739 --> 04:03:01,739
I mean you ran over a guy

2039
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:07,000
Yeah, i've picked quiet ride before

2040
04:03:07,479 --> 04:03:10,110
He's like, all right, let's have a quiet ride

2041
04:03:11,159 --> 04:03:16,760
And you get picked up and the person just like hey arty. How are you? How you doing stranger? It's just like oh shit

2042
04:03:17,799 --> 04:03:28,489
So what are you up to in town?

2043
04:03:28,489 --> 04:03:32,680
I'm just like, oh wait, I guess you didn't look at the thing that I clicked

2044
04:03:33,319 --> 04:03:39,920
And I wonder if sometimes do you

2045
04:03:40,879 --> 04:03:44,879
It's alex do you think do you think that people look at that after they get picked up like if you get picked up

2046
04:03:44,879 --> 04:03:46,879
And you know that you were talking

2047
04:03:47,360 --> 04:03:50,799
Do you think you get really pissed off at yourself after seeing that afterwards?

2048
04:03:51,440 --> 04:03:53,040
Are you like, oh

2049
04:03:53,040 --> 04:03:57,600
Oh my god, that person wanted me to shut the fuck up and I talked for for 30 straight minutes

2050
04:03:59,290 --> 04:04:02,809
See, that's what I that's what I did when I got in here, but I just didn't want to say anything

2051
04:04:06,559 --> 04:04:11,360
I feel like that's a really really scary moment where you're just like, all right. See you later. Have a wonderful trip

2052
04:04:11,440 --> 04:04:16,079
It's been a great time having you in the car. You look over and you see like in the settings they picked quiet ride

2053
04:04:18,409 --> 04:04:22,889
That's what I that's what I said, I picked quiet ride, but anyway, thank thank you. Thank you. It's been fun

2054
04:04:23,290 --> 04:04:25,290
Um, i'll be sure to leave a five-star review

2055
04:04:26,590 --> 04:04:29,229
And i'm changing my tip right now. No

2056
04:04:32,170 --> 04:04:34,010
That's what you were doing

2057
04:04:34,010 --> 04:04:50,079
All right. So we have we have this quest, but what does he want us to go? Is that the meat one?

2058
04:04:51,549 --> 04:04:53,549
uh, this is a

2059
04:04:54,440 --> 04:04:56,760
main quest the meat one is

2060
04:04:58,489 --> 04:05:00,010
We have to find

2061
04:05:00,010 --> 04:05:03,290
Crocodiles also are we gonna are we gonna do the meme?

2062
04:05:03,850 --> 04:05:09,549
What's the meme?

2063
04:05:09,549 --> 04:05:11,549
This is the meme. What do you do?

2064
04:05:15,129 --> 04:05:18,010
Well, if uh, if the menu didn't come up this would have done it

2065
04:05:18,090 --> 04:05:23,879
So it was going to happen regardless because you're also on this screen. I don't understand

2066
04:05:24,440 --> 04:05:27,959
Uh, you have to you have to press you have to talk to this guy and press ready

2067
04:05:33,100 --> 04:05:40,700

2068
04:05:42,319 --> 04:05:44,319
Oh, what the fuck this guy

2069
04:05:44,559 --> 04:05:49,469
You're gonna jump in the ring yourself go check out that box next to the arena

2070
04:05:49,469 --> 04:05:52,590
It's not even my name. That's somebody else's never did anything for you. That's a fake name

2071
04:05:52,670 --> 04:06:00,200
Somebody would have you need to find and pick at least one rooster. Oh, we don't have a we don't have one

2072
04:06:00,440 --> 04:06:16,760
Uh, there's one in a box like around I picked one up. I don't get it roosters. It's a rooster

2073
04:06:20,719 --> 04:06:22,719

04:08:38,969 --> 04:08:46,590
You have to build meter

2101
04:08:48,760 --> 04:08:51,399
This is it. There was okay. First of all, there's like

2102
04:08:52,100 --> 04:08:54,100
25 characters in this

2103
04:08:55,950 --> 04:08:57,790
Okay, how do you block?

2104
04:08:57,790 --> 04:09:03,680
I don't think there is a block

2105
04:09:03,680 --> 04:09:06,639
There is meter. Yeah, there's meter left control

2106
04:09:07,520 --> 04:09:15,229
Did you do super what the fuck how do you just it was left control

2107
04:09:21,610 --> 04:09:27,799
Come on

2108
04:09:27,799 --> 04:09:30,120
They spent like way too much time on this

2109
04:09:32,030 --> 04:09:40,700
This is i'm like i'm like getting sweaty right now

2110
04:09:44,700 --> 04:09:46,700
And then flap right over your head

2111
04:09:56,479 --> 04:10:01,680
What dude we're like holding it like oh good a good job like petting the the the chicken

2112
04:10:03,209 --> 04:10:04,729
What?

2113
04:10:04,729 --> 04:10:08,920
the fuck

2114
04:10:08,920 --> 04:10:10,920
Oh, dude

2115
04:10:11,639 --> 04:10:16,120
What

2116
04:10:16,200 --> 04:10:21,479
All right. Well that that you can unlock uh, 25 different chickens that you can um, you can fight with them

2117
04:10:22,120 --> 04:10:26,250
You can yeah

2118
04:10:26,250 --> 04:10:28,569
now let's go back to playing the other game that I think is

2119
04:10:29,430 --> 04:10:33,930
Significantly more tasteful where my attack dog can rip the throat out of the people that I have trained it to

2120
04:10:34,729 --> 04:10:40,010
And then go back to running over civilians with tractors and shooting people mindlessly in the head

2121
04:10:40,090 --> 04:10:42,090
I think that's a little bit more tasteful guys

2122
04:10:44,639 --> 04:10:46,319
All right, let's go

2123
04:10:46,319 --> 04:10:56,670
Do we have to go to the road?

2124
04:10:56,670 --> 04:10:58,350
good point

2125
04:10:58,350 --> 04:11:05,260
So where's this? Where's this? Do you have it something map? I don't have this on my map

2126
04:11:05,899 --> 04:11:08,270
That I saw them down at the road

2127
04:11:10,989 --> 04:11:12,190
in

2128
04:11:12,190 --> 04:11:15,629
Here we go. Uh, well we have options. Oh, okay, we can do this

2129
04:11:17,680 --> 04:11:19,360
we can do

2130
04:11:19,360 --> 04:11:21,979
Whatever this purple quest is

2131
04:11:31,149 --> 04:11:34,670
Why don't you give us a give us something cool to do while I spawn a plane?

2132
04:11:35,309 --> 04:11:43,360
The biggest map is actually pretty large

2133
04:11:46,600 --> 04:11:51,420
Uh, we'd like just got to the main island. Yeah, but if it's anything like any of the other ubisoft games

2134
04:11:52,280 --> 04:11:56,680
Um, it's probably just a copy and paste of this five times

2135
04:12:01,079 --> 04:12:03,799
Assassin's creed valhalla was actually too big

2136
04:12:05,579 --> 04:12:07,739
It was unplayed. It was like no there's no way to finish

2137
04:12:10,030 --> 04:12:11,229
Yeah

2138
04:12:11,229 --> 04:12:14,110
As we go into the next generation of video games

2139
04:12:16,270 --> 04:12:21,469
I don't a settling point for a game is not how big a map is right? I feel like that people are still on that

2140
04:12:22,700 --> 04:12:28,059
Yeah, there's no reason to make a game like a like a adventure action game like 300 hours

2141
04:12:28,059 --> 04:12:33,899
Well, all you do is pop in and out of cover to shoot your enemies and listen to cutscenes. Sorry red dead

2142
04:12:35,420 --> 04:12:37,420
Just wait, you just talked shit about red dead

2143
04:12:38,219 --> 04:12:40,459
Yeah, it was a baiting switch. You thought I was talking about ubisoft game

2144
04:12:40,540 --> 04:12:42,540
Really? I was talking about red dead too you

2145
04:12:43,420 --> 04:12:46,219
Oh, I I just fucking threw up for a second. You just what'd you say?

2146
04:12:46,219 --> 04:12:49,659
But what'd you say about red dead being you don't like it? What'd you say that again?

2147
04:12:51,020 --> 04:12:54,059
I just said it was like too long. How could you possibly finish it?

2148
04:12:54,940 --> 04:13:06,909
Is I love that game it's alexis based no, I am i'm based i'm the base one stop saying that

2149
04:13:13,879 --> 04:13:15,879
No, you're cringe

2150
04:13:17,500 --> 04:13:27,469
It's true. Okay odds of you turning abruptly and ramming this directly into the mountain zero

2151
04:13:32,239 --> 04:13:36,200
I have to move

2152
04:13:42,639 --> 04:13:49,930
I freaked out

2153
04:13:50,729 --> 04:13:53,770
I could just feel it coming on. Yeah, I didn't do that on purpose

2154
04:13:53,850 --> 04:13:58,809
I think that was self-fulfilling prophecy level of destiny where like I created the scenario

2155
04:14:01,450 --> 04:14:06,280
I think so

2156
04:14:06,280 --> 04:14:08,360
Well, the thing just starts beeping in my ear and it's like

2157
04:14:09,879 --> 04:14:13,639
It's the person says a missile is gonna hit us. I'm gonna try to freak out

2158
04:14:14,600 --> 04:14:16,600
Okay, we can hang on. Let me pick a different mission

2159
04:14:19,389 --> 04:14:22,780
We can um

2160
04:14:22,780 --> 04:14:24,940
steal some spurs

2161
04:14:24,940 --> 04:14:26,379
we can

2162
04:14:26,379 --> 04:14:29,020
Steal a military truck. We need to do the

2163
04:14:29,579 --> 04:14:33,840
Don't meet a guy

2164
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:38,500
Both of our chats are not going to be happy if we don't do the dachshund quest. We both have dachshunds

2165
04:14:40,010 --> 04:14:42,200
carrizo charrizo

2166
04:14:42,200 --> 04:14:46,200
charrizo the dachshund

2167
04:14:46,200 --> 04:14:50,040
All right helicopter you drive at this. I'm not I don't want you know, what's gonna happen if I do

2168
04:14:50,840 --> 04:14:52,840
Says there are lots of crocs

2169
04:14:53,000 --> 04:14:58,250
Try searching serpentino park. Where's serpentino park?

2170
04:14:59,450 --> 04:15:08,319
Uh serpentino park, okay, I see a spot is it in the same area we are in that's pretty close

2171
04:15:08,879 --> 04:15:13,659
It's like almost walking distance. Do you do you not have a wingsuit still?

2172
04:15:14,139 --> 04:15:22,440
No, unless it's like in my inventory and I have to equip it or something. Did you have to equip it?

2173
04:15:23,389 --> 04:15:34,479
Uh, no, I just built a like camp building come talk to this foreman and see maybe I'll just give it to me

2174
04:15:35,450 --> 04:15:41,309
Uh, maybe

2175
04:15:41,309 --> 04:15:50,809
The crocodiles are down there. Did you mark them? Yeah, only player one gets the wingsuit. Oh

2176
04:15:51,610 --> 04:15:56,399
Really really you have to play single player in order to unlock it because you're you're the co-op partner

2177
04:15:58,680 --> 04:16:03,000
Oh, so your character doesn't like so wait. Do I not exist? Is this one of those games?

2178
04:16:04,170 --> 04:16:08,010
Yeah, I think it's I think it's one of those uh, anything that happens only happens in my game

2179
04:16:09,639 --> 04:16:13,000
You know, it's really really really annoying about all that if that's true

2180
04:16:14,159 --> 04:16:21,420
They push the fact that this whole campaign can be played in co-op if you're gonna make that a huge part

2181
04:16:21,899 --> 04:16:27,340
Of your selling point for the game and again the whole campaign is playable in co-op grab a friend

2182
04:16:28,750 --> 04:16:30,750
But don't let him leave drop out

2183
04:16:30,750 --> 04:16:39,739
Don't let your fucking friend leave at least give me like the major like plot points or something

2184
04:16:39,739 --> 04:16:48,479
So I don't have to do the whole thing

2185
04:16:48,479 --> 04:16:50,479
Because like I could definitely do this

2186
04:16:51,469 --> 04:17:09,049
You get to have the fun. Bye. I think I got you at once didn't I you hit me once

2187
04:17:10,170 --> 04:17:26,840
Well, she could be as cool as me with all my premium guns my suit skin

2188
04:17:26,920 --> 04:17:30,680
Hold on while i'm waiting for you to come i'm gonna equip one of my new premium skins

2189
04:17:33,959 --> 04:17:40,250
All right. Let's see how much I care about this. Is it on?

2190
04:17:44,430 --> 04:17:47,229
Well, I just saw the curtain pull back from the game that just spawned in

2191
04:17:50,430 --> 04:17:53,530
I have cowboy boots

2192
04:17:53,530 --> 04:17:54,889
And a hat

2193
04:17:54,889 --> 04:17:57,420
It's not gonna shoot us, right?

2194
04:17:57,420 --> 04:17:59,850
Put your gun away put your gun away

2195
04:17:59,850 --> 04:18:03,690
Yeah, nice

2196
04:18:03,690 --> 04:18:06,250
They can't they can't see through your disguise you

2197
04:18:07,500 --> 04:18:09,709
budget-tier

2198
04:18:09,709 --> 04:18:12,590
Pyro cosplay, I guess they're unhappy

2199
04:18:13,549 --> 04:18:16,110
I think they've noticed that we

2200
04:18:17,280 --> 04:18:19,280
Look extremely suspicious

2201
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:27,500
Oh my arm, how are you supposed to deal with tanks?

2202
04:18:28,139 --> 04:18:32,459
I think you're just supposed to avoid them

2203
04:18:32,459 --> 04:18:36,350
All right, get in the car

2204
04:18:36,350 --> 04:18:44,989
I have no heels

2205
04:18:44,989 --> 04:18:51,389
Who is that standing in the what who is somebody standing in the middle of the road? Who is this person?

2206
04:18:53,559 --> 04:18:59,680
Oh

2207
04:18:59,680 --> 04:19:02,969
I'm down

2208
04:19:02,969 --> 04:19:07,770
That escalates very quickly. You just had you got we can't avoid the tanks. We stood there for too long

2209
04:19:08,090 --> 04:19:18,250
Has jerma ever played a video game back in like the late 80s? I played mario 1 and 2 and stuff

2210
04:19:19,840 --> 04:19:22,159
I haven't played since anything since probably like mario 3

2211
04:19:22,799 --> 04:19:34,409
Uh, we played pong recently. All right, we're gonna stay on the road. We're not gonna stop for anything

2212
04:19:34,409 --> 04:19:37,930
We're not gonna shoot anybody. I'm just gonna drive on the road. We're gonna go where we're supposed to go

2213
04:19:40,760 --> 04:19:44,590
Are you in loading screen? Yes, I am. We're currently stuck in here again

2214
04:19:45,799 --> 04:20:02,569
Uh-oh, when are you gonna stream cubert? What are they gonna give bomb moms their own game?

2215
04:20:08,590 --> 04:20:12,920
Like how come toad gets one?

2216
04:20:12,920 --> 04:20:17,790
How come games made by like one person?

2217
04:20:21,450 --> 04:20:24,889
Like don't have you like get disconnected their loading screen

2218
04:20:28,959 --> 04:20:32,959
They spent a lot of money on this loading screen. This was a high tier commission

2219
04:20:37,790 --> 04:20:41,950
Like there are games right now that were made by like three people and they run like flawlessly

2220
04:20:48,569 --> 04:20:52,110
Uh, I just got booted

2221
04:20:54,670 --> 04:20:57,549
out of the game

2222
04:20:57,549 --> 04:20:59,549
He hates the game. No

2223
04:21:00,200 --> 04:21:04,200
I actually think it's fun. These games are all fun. They're all six out of tens, but they're fun to play

2224
04:21:04,680 --> 04:21:11,020
Maybe more fun if uh, we didn't have to reload in because the game crashes on a loading screen. Yeah

2225
04:21:11,659 --> 04:21:21,340
Yeah, i'm just gonna uh hard restart how long we've been streaming for I feel like it's been a while i'm flies when you're having fun

2226
04:21:24,200 --> 04:21:26,829
All right, i'm gonna force quit the game again

2227
04:21:28,280 --> 04:21:33,000
Hey, he hates the game. I don't hate the game. How long we've been streaming for i'm just

2228
04:21:36,540 --> 04:21:54,920
No, it's different. It's not what you think. Okay force quit again. It's still it's not even all my

2229
04:21:56,889 --> 04:22:03,950
Six out of ten. Is that the number of times that the game loads back in after you die?

2230
04:22:04,510 --> 04:22:15,399
I I okay. Thank god. I thought I was gonna have to restart my computer. All right strike three strike three and you're up

2231
04:22:15,559 --> 04:22:25,239
Ubisoft i'm telling you right now strike three and you're up coming back. Just don't die forehead

2232
04:22:25,399 --> 04:22:29,559
Which is yeah, we we just have to like not die and just run to where we need to go

2233
04:22:29,879 --> 04:22:41,579
And hey we did me and it's alex talked about playing this and we even said what did we say?

2234
04:22:42,440 --> 04:22:45,000
Let's wait like a week or so

2235
04:22:45,079 --> 04:22:49,000
So like the maybe they'll iron out the connection problem stuff, right?

2236
04:22:49,719 --> 04:22:52,680
You think there will be a patch in the first week? No, I don't know

2237
04:22:56,909 --> 04:22:59,709
It's been it was running fine for like four hours. That's what I don't understand

2238
04:23:02,639 --> 04:23:06,000
Maybe I should have done a full hard reset of my game too. It's only been three days

2239
04:23:06,889 --> 04:23:08,889
Has it really how that's been like five

2240
04:23:09,290 --> 04:23:18,360
Uh, can you just join off me or do I need to invite you? Uh, let me say I can join you

2241
04:23:18,600 --> 04:23:26,809
This is another one of those games that has like 12 splash screens before you get to the game

2242
04:23:31,260 --> 04:23:33,579
All right, can I join off of you? Let's find out

2243
04:23:38,510 --> 04:23:41,200
When the game is working

2244
04:23:41,200 --> 04:23:44,479
There's actually probably fewer bugs than far cry 5 had

2245
04:23:46,840 --> 04:23:53,559
Uh, i'm apparently i'm offline somehow. Let me see if I can just join you

2246
04:23:57,770 --> 04:24:06,250
but also I was basically playing with um with training weights because i've been playing the battlefield beta and uh come like

2247
04:24:07,049 --> 04:24:11,770
I have a total misconception of what constitutes like a buggy game after playing that because

2248
04:24:13,020 --> 04:24:17,180
All right, um, I I can go my friends list and I have I have three icons

2249
04:24:17,260 --> 04:24:20,780
One of them is a controller one of them is a chat bubble and one of them is the three dots

2250
04:24:20,860 --> 04:24:23,500
I don't know what any of them do i'm gonna try to press them

2251
04:24:24,569 --> 04:24:33,200
I think I can invite you but I can't join you. I think you're gonna have to invite me again

2252
04:24:33,360 --> 04:24:44,459
Resident sleeper. Yeah, I would be too. I I am right now actually that I am resident sleeper right now

2253
04:24:47,120 --> 04:25:00,239
Launcher on your desktop. It says you're offline for me. I don't know why you get that

2254
04:25:00,399 --> 04:25:03,850
I got that but I don't know why it says you're offline. All right, here we go

2255
04:25:04,489 --> 04:25:09,870
As i'm online i'm mine rack your knuckles. Let's go

2256
04:25:11,500 --> 04:25:13,479
Okay

2257
04:25:13,479 --> 04:25:21,790
Okay, cool. We're back. I'm in a plane. Are you in the plane?

2258
04:25:22,030 --> 04:25:26,030
I guess i'm just I don't think this is a good idea because how we gotta we gotta come we gotta like just

2259
04:25:26,809 --> 04:25:31,690
Abandon the plane before we both crash. No, no, no, he's gonna reset the game get in the plane

2260
04:25:31,850 --> 04:25:35,209
I'm gonna fly we're gonna jump out of our parachutes and get out

2261
04:25:39,260 --> 04:25:41,260
Good idea. I like that idea. Okay

2262
04:25:42,139 --> 04:25:53,450
The plane bit no, this is not gonna wait i'm not even driving you are just get us close enough

2263
04:25:53,850 --> 04:25:56,969
Once we're in the red area with the red zone. We're gonna jump out and just float

2264
04:26:04,489 --> 04:26:05,530
nice

2265
04:26:05,530 --> 04:26:11,600
Very nice. Very nice. How do you turn like the view angle?

2266
04:26:12,399 --> 04:26:17,100
I don't think so

2267
04:26:17,100 --> 04:26:19,100
How low do you think I could fly without?

2268
04:26:19,260 --> 04:26:24,329
Okay, and it's time for us to get out. I'm up

2269
04:26:24,969 --> 04:26:30,139
Did you get out?

2270
04:26:30,139 --> 04:26:37,200
No, let me know i'm still in the plane where you're going too far from your partner

2271
04:26:40,639 --> 04:26:45,520
Wait, why did you put me back in the plane? I don't want to be in the plane. I want to get out of the plane

2272
04:26:45,920 --> 04:26:47,920
Don't get out of the plane. No

2273
04:26:52,879 --> 04:26:54,959
Okay

2274
04:26:54,959 --> 04:26:57,520
No, don't pull me back in the plane. It's gonna pull me back in the plane

2275
04:26:58,799 --> 04:27:02,969
You're too far

2276
04:27:02,969 --> 04:27:09,370
I want one of us to survive so we don't have to have the how are you? Wait, you're alive. You're fine. Yeah, everything's chill

2277
04:27:10,409 --> 04:27:13,690
I'm not sure why you're in such a panic because we were in the red zone

2278
04:27:14,719 --> 04:27:16,719
Yeah, but there's an actual pilot

2279
04:27:16,719 --> 04:27:18,959
Right this time who doesn't just crash

2280
04:27:19,680 --> 04:27:24,799
Into the mountain at the first beep in his ear. I'm here some composure. This is what we have and uh, get respect safety

2281
04:27:25,040 --> 04:27:27,500
We have to go here

2282
04:27:27,500 --> 04:27:29,500
You got us to our destination. You did a good job

2283
04:27:39,469 --> 04:27:40,750
You all right

2284
04:27:40,750 --> 04:27:42,729
Yeah, i'm here

2285
04:27:42,729 --> 04:27:44,489
In fact, i'm here first

2286
04:27:44,489 --> 04:27:48,649
Oh, yeah

2287
04:27:48,649 --> 04:27:53,209
You're welcome. See imagine if we both bailed out the first time we'd be in the jungle lost

2288
04:27:54,250 --> 04:27:56,250
And uh, we'd have to walk like 500 meters

2289
04:27:57,129 --> 04:27:59,129
So I just saved the stream like, uh

2290
04:27:59,209 --> 04:28:03,850
12 minutes of of aimlessly wandering while we're trying to scramble for something entertaining to say

2291
04:28:04,010 --> 04:28:07,530
That's true to try to get a laugh in order to distract the resident sleepers in chat. That's true

2292
04:28:08,170 --> 04:28:10,489
Yeah, that's right. You got it. You know what you're talking about

2293
04:28:11,600 --> 04:28:18,879
All right. Here we go

2294
04:28:18,879 --> 04:28:20,879
to steal favorite spurs

2295
04:28:24,139 --> 04:28:28,940
Would be stealthed. I don't know why this quest is

2296
04:28:33,899 --> 04:28:36,059
Yeah, why are we I thought we're doing the dachshund quest

2297
04:28:39,049 --> 04:28:41,690
They're supposed to be crocodiles like in the area above

2298
04:28:42,569 --> 04:28:45,709
No, I think he's or alligators

2299
04:28:46,489 --> 04:28:48,670
Well, we can do both. What's the difference?

2300
04:28:49,309 --> 04:28:51,649
I actually don't know which ones are native to america

2301
04:28:54,010 --> 04:28:56,010
Lots of stuff to collect

2302
04:29:01,399 --> 04:29:03,639
Getting hurt that was a new rooster fighter

2303
04:29:04,440 --> 04:29:06,440
What's hurting us? I keep oh

2304
04:29:06,840 --> 04:29:09,079
Something's bumping into us or hurting us

2305
04:29:13,799 --> 04:29:15,549
No

2306
04:29:15,549 --> 04:29:17,549
My character's making sounds like I was getting hurt

2307
04:29:22,750 --> 04:29:24,750
Fine

2308
04:29:29,850 --> 04:29:34,090
Where's all the like throw the weapons from far cry five if roosters start coming out of the walls

2309
04:29:36,170 --> 04:29:42,729
They took out they took out throw weapons and they took out the car with the back doors that could open and trap helicopters in them

2310
04:29:43,370 --> 04:29:45,610
Why is windows telling me to switch my language?

2311
04:29:46,329 --> 04:29:49,340
I just changed my input language

2312
04:29:50,440 --> 04:29:51,319
what

2313
04:29:51,319 --> 04:30:07,450
Smith's something going on down here

2314
04:30:15,129 --> 04:30:18,889
Is this like a turkey over here? There's a there's like a big rooster turkey chicken over here

2315
04:30:19,690 --> 04:30:22,569
Oh, good luck king rooster

2316
04:30:22,729 --> 04:30:27,840
Do we have to fight it?

2317
04:30:27,840 --> 04:30:29,840
The animals are angry

2318
04:30:29,920 --> 04:30:35,739
I'm trying to get this a good cinematic angle

2319
04:30:37,959 --> 04:30:40,520
oh what was

2320
04:30:40,520 --> 04:30:42,520
That was uh, anticlimactic

2321
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:45,200
oh

2322
04:30:45,200 --> 04:30:48,159
My cat just kind of unceremoniously wait

2323
04:30:52,239 --> 04:30:54,190
um

2324
04:30:54,190 --> 04:30:56,190
Escape the bunker. Yeah, there was a bunch of them

2325
04:31:10,360 --> 04:31:12,360
My familiar has taken this quest

2326
04:31:13,540 --> 04:31:16,440
Objectives you've got to pay to win cat. That's not fair

2327
04:31:21,129 --> 04:31:23,319
I think this is supposed to be

2328
04:31:23,319 --> 04:31:25,879
Intense. No, I think this is supposed to be a horror

2329
04:31:26,520 --> 04:31:29,040
hallway parody

2330
04:31:29,040 --> 04:31:31,040
Yeah, that was kind of funny. Let's go

2331
04:31:36,010 --> 04:31:44,000
Dps press v. No, not in here

2332
04:31:44,639 --> 04:31:54,219
It smells like shit get out get out get out get out man get out

2333
04:32:13,579 --> 04:32:15,579
Okay, I think um

2334
04:32:16,059 --> 04:32:25,040
Don't leave me in here

2335
04:32:25,040 --> 04:32:26,639
Dude, get him. Watch out

2336
04:32:26,639 --> 04:32:28,329
All right, we did it

2337
04:32:28,329 --> 04:32:29,530
nice work

2338
04:32:29,530 --> 04:32:39,319
Let's head back to very very dramatic music

2339
04:32:40,120 --> 04:32:45,100
Okay objective complete

2340
04:32:47,709 --> 04:32:49,149
Place

2341
04:32:49,149 --> 04:32:51,149
shit birds everywhere

2342
04:32:51,790 --> 04:32:54,590
This must be crocodiles here though a chicken put a bullet in me

2343
04:33:01,040 --> 04:33:03,040
That's 2 000 meters away. Oh my god

2344
04:33:04,220 --> 04:33:05,659
That's not

2345
04:33:05,659 --> 04:33:07,419
That's just the turning

2346
04:33:07,419 --> 04:33:10,360
So where's the the alligators are right here somewhere, right?

2347
04:33:11,709 --> 04:33:13,470
Like it. Yeah

2348
04:33:13,470 --> 04:33:20,009
I found chorizo's recipe. They should be well try and make it for him. No, they're down here

2349
04:33:25,950 --> 04:33:32,509
Uh, i'm not insignificant distance away that's very far that's further than oh my god, it's so far

2350
04:33:32,509 --> 04:33:39,470
I don't know how this I feel like i'm driving the car. Okay, uh

2351
04:33:40,270 --> 04:33:42,270
Your mark my worst ass

2352
04:33:43,950 --> 04:33:45,310
Oh, sorry

2353
04:33:45,310 --> 04:33:50,009
that better

2354
04:33:50,009 --> 04:33:52,880
Careful with your

2355
04:33:52,880 --> 04:34:12,029
I'm good. I think they're gonna spike strip us. I think so

2356
04:34:13,069 --> 04:34:15,069
Oh

2357
04:34:15,389 --> 04:34:19,479
It worked

2358
04:34:19,479 --> 04:34:28,250
emerging gameplay

2359
04:34:28,569 --> 04:34:31,450
Pick up the goddamn purse. What the hell? All right

2360
04:34:32,250 --> 04:34:41,639
I am guarding the alarm. I think we're okay now

2361
04:34:42,569 --> 04:34:45,069
The alarm should be broken now, right?

2362
04:34:45,229 --> 04:34:46,909
Uh, I think so

2363
04:34:46,909 --> 04:34:55,340
Is it like one more guy?

2364
04:34:55,340 --> 04:34:57,259
I think that's it

2365
04:34:57,259 --> 04:34:59,340
I think if we kill all the guys we control the checkpoint

2366
04:35:03,919 --> 04:35:09,849
Oh something in here

2367
04:35:09,849 --> 04:35:11,500
We got

2368
04:35:11,500 --> 04:35:14,139
Gun powder. I think gunpowder lets you make guns

2369
04:35:14,779 --> 04:35:17,419
Oh, all right. It's probably just like crafting the tank again

2370
04:35:18,459 --> 04:35:19,819
I'm just hiding

2371
04:35:19,819 --> 04:35:23,259
He's hiding here

2372
04:35:23,259 --> 04:35:25,979
Let's just do the left for dead strategy where everyone goes in the bathroom

2373
04:35:28,349 --> 04:35:30,509
And everyone aims out the door with auto shotguns

2374
04:35:31,150 --> 04:35:37,979
I don't think he knows

2375
04:35:37,979 --> 04:35:44,279
Is he leaving he's investigating sort of and also crashing

2376
04:35:46,299 --> 04:35:51,159
Maybe becoming stuck

2377
04:35:51,159 --> 04:35:53,159
Looks like he's stuck. I think we can go

2378
04:35:56,189 --> 04:35:58,189
Yeah, he's stuck. All right, let's get out of here

2379
04:36:01,930 --> 04:36:12,400
I mean I can steal the horse, but let's get the car. I missed whatever

2380
04:36:15,849 --> 04:36:21,229
Take this one. Oh

2381
04:36:21,790 --> 04:36:23,790
Don't just keep driving

2382
04:36:25,180 --> 04:36:27,180
I don't just keep driving

2383
04:36:33,680 --> 04:36:46,409
You're just rolling up

2384
04:36:46,409 --> 04:36:48,409
This thing doesn't do shit

2385
04:36:49,500 --> 04:36:53,819
All right movie, uh, you you can jump on the roof of mine. I gotta get the shot. Come on

2386
04:37:06,759 --> 04:37:09,000
All right. I agree a movie scene has to play out here

2387
04:37:09,720 --> 04:37:12,509
A movie scene you're expecting a lot

2388
04:37:14,110 --> 04:37:17,549
Hey, let's go to do a movie scene in front of the camera. Hey, uh

2389
04:37:18,669 --> 04:37:26,040
Do something funny

2390
04:37:26,040 --> 04:37:56,080
Oh, that's a great shot great angle actually perfect shot right here. Okay. I got an idea nice and tight right there

2391
04:37:59,049 --> 04:38:04,000
That actually scared the shit out of me that startled me. I thought he crashed into like a wall

2392
04:38:12,240 --> 04:38:15,319
Cut yeah, good shot. Good scene

2393
04:38:18,080 --> 04:38:22,799
On to the crocodile meat

2394
04:38:22,799 --> 04:38:29,229
You drive. Okay. Thank you italics. Now we don't have to do that for an hour

2395
04:38:30,189 --> 04:38:33,709
X is gun. Oh cool

2396
04:38:35,040 --> 04:38:37,040
Uh, you kind of put this in a ditch here

2397
04:38:37,689 --> 04:38:40,409
I mean I dove out of the car. It just went where it was going to go

2398
04:38:41,759 --> 04:38:44,799
I think we may need a new one. No, we're okay

2399
04:38:49,500 --> 04:38:54,139
The scooper on front is supposed to flip cars, but it doesn't seem to work

2400
04:38:55,020 --> 04:38:59,500
I don't this happened. You just came to a complete stop. Why?

2401
04:39:01,340 --> 04:39:04,139
Instantly the engine just fell out of the car

2402
04:39:07,099 --> 04:39:09,340
I think i'm hitting you

2403
04:39:09,340 --> 04:39:15,500
I think i'm running into you my power as host is simply too great. It might be your shield

2404
04:39:16,540 --> 04:39:18,540
Wait, I didn't want to hit all those chickens

2405
04:39:18,540 --> 04:39:22,830
That's actually a good idea. What if I what if you run to me at full speed while I have a shield equipped?

2406
04:39:23,869 --> 04:39:25,470
You block it

2407
04:39:25,470 --> 04:39:30,909
I don't know. That's what I wanted to find out your uh legs are doing lots of interesting things

2408
04:39:31,709 --> 04:39:42,680
You want to try it?

2409
04:39:42,680 --> 04:39:45,479
Now you get all the hold your shield up and put it right in front of the car

2410
04:39:46,119 --> 04:40:00,409
It works

2411
04:40:00,409 --> 04:40:02,409
Are you serious? Are you kidding me?

2412
04:40:03,369 --> 04:40:05,689
No, it does not hang on. I wonder if it works with the tank

2413
04:40:11,930 --> 04:40:14,409
This i'm fine

2414
04:40:14,409 --> 04:40:26,490
That shouldn't work

2415
04:40:27,840 --> 04:40:31,040
You dodged the horse good job. I did I don't want to hit the horse

2416
04:40:40,459 --> 04:40:42,459
This marvel movie is whack

2417
04:40:43,180 --> 04:40:45,180
parried a truck

2418
04:40:58,000 --> 04:40:59,840
Uh, we gotta try like a

2419
04:40:59,840 --> 04:41:01,119
airplane

2420
04:41:01,119 --> 04:41:03,119
I I know but it blocks explosions

2421
04:41:03,840 --> 04:41:06,959
Oh if I flew into you with an airplane, would you block it? That's a good idea

2422
04:41:07,599 --> 04:41:09,439
It's a really good idea

2423
04:41:09,439 --> 04:41:12,240
Let's try that in a little bit

2424
04:41:12,240 --> 04:41:18,959
What happens if I hit v while you're driving?

2425
04:41:19,599 --> 04:41:22,959
It'll probably blow the car up and we'll have to get to a loading screen and be mad at the area

2426
04:41:23,520 --> 04:41:28,569
I can

2427
04:41:28,650 --> 04:41:30,650
You got hit by a barrel

2428
04:41:32,540 --> 04:41:34,540
All right, uh go fast or

2429
04:41:35,099 --> 04:41:37,229
Yeah, we gotta go this way

2430
04:41:37,229 --> 04:41:40,139
All right, go fast

2431
04:41:40,139 --> 04:41:42,139
Yeah, i'm just gonna hit v

2432
04:41:43,040 --> 04:41:45,689
going fast

2433
04:41:45,689 --> 04:41:47,689
You're still on the car. It works

2434
04:41:51,240 --> 04:41:57,479
Uh newton's law of physics says that a perpetual motion something will be in motion until it is out of motion

2435
04:41:57,799 --> 04:42:01,959
When I was a young boy and what I played with trains, I sure did love them

2436
04:42:03,520 --> 04:42:09,439
My sister was a very interesting person. That's the first 15 seconds of young sheldon. Thank you very much

2437
04:42:14,880 --> 04:42:18,000
It was literally the first like 30 seconds of young sheldon episode 1 pilot

2438
04:42:18,319 --> 04:42:23,939
Yeah, but it sounded like the right man in the wrong place can make all the different

2439
04:42:24,880 --> 04:42:27,720
stuff

2440
04:42:27,720 --> 04:42:30,919
They're just dropping like paratroopers down here. Are they firing at us?

2441
04:42:36,540 --> 04:42:39,099
I'm very confused who they're shooting at. Yeah, they're shooting at us. Why what happened?

2442
04:42:39,819 --> 04:42:41,819
We're just here. We exist

2443
04:42:41,819 --> 04:42:46,380
They don't need a reason

2444
04:42:46,380 --> 04:42:47,819
Well, what the heck?

2445
04:42:47,819 --> 04:42:49,819
I have a shield. Why don't you get one?

2446
04:42:49,819 --> 04:42:58,700
Come on. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal. Heal

2447
04:42:59,869 --> 04:43:08,060
heal

2448
04:43:08,060 --> 04:43:13,180
Got him get the helicopter get the helicopter might be able to fly that out

2449
04:43:13,819 --> 04:43:20,430
Give me this fucking thing right now. Come on. Does it let you jump in? No

2450
04:43:21,389 --> 04:43:29,869
What if we get a what if we get a boat and push it?

2451
04:43:29,950 --> 04:43:32,110
Why is it so hard to get a helicopter in this game?

2452
04:43:32,669 --> 04:43:37,840
I mean the way we have access to them is just yeah, they're in weird places shitty one. This is the big one

2453
04:43:38,159 --> 04:43:40,159
So we're looking for um

2454
04:43:40,240 --> 04:43:42,590
crocodiles here

2455
04:43:42,590 --> 04:43:43,630
This one

2456
04:43:43,630 --> 04:43:47,200
Do we are we supposed to kill them?

2457
04:43:47,200 --> 04:44:04,029
What's this look like to you?

2458
04:44:04,029 --> 04:44:08,029
Um, I was I don't know. I was videoing it. I was hoping he was gonna kill you

2459
04:44:08,909 --> 04:44:13,389
I was hoping he was gonna kill you and I was gonna have like a picture of you getting eaten by a crocodile

2460
04:44:13,389 --> 04:44:46,569
But that didn't happen. I got you. Who's this? Oh, dude, there's rats. They're rats

2461
04:44:47,450 --> 04:44:50,409
No, it's not. This is a gopher. Oh shit. Can you can they be friends?

2462
04:44:52,459 --> 04:44:54,700
What is this? How do we uh, can we like press e or anything?

2463
04:44:55,340 --> 04:45:01,419
Like a beaver. I don't think that's like a beaver

2464
04:45:05,770 --> 04:45:07,770
All right. So now we're gonna bring the treat back to auto

2465
04:45:09,049 --> 04:45:11,229
Or midas either one

2466
04:45:11,229 --> 04:45:13,630
Hang on both. Hang on. I just got the option to feed

2467
04:45:14,349 --> 04:45:15,549
Really?

2468
04:45:15,549 --> 04:45:17,630
Yeah, but I can't see it again because they're like scared

2469
04:45:18,490 --> 04:45:27,950
Holy shit

2470
04:45:27,950 --> 04:45:29,979
Damn it

2471
04:45:29,979 --> 04:45:31,680
Maybe we need to sneak up

2472
04:45:31,680 --> 04:45:33,680
I don't know. It definitely said feed

2473
04:45:33,759 --> 04:45:44,119
There's more up ahead. See if you can get the ones, uh, that haven't been like spooked yet. Yeah

2474
04:45:44,840 --> 04:45:54,330
All right. Let's let's let's creep up. Okay. That's a jack rabbits. Why are we like we're like hurting them?

2475
04:45:54,990 --> 04:46:01,630
No, I don't think so. We're trying to feed them. No like h e hard like uh, oh I see like protecting them

2476
04:46:01,950 --> 04:46:05,020
I really hope this doesn't lead to a street

2477
04:46:05,020 --> 04:46:20,330
Pretty game. They're just so squeaky. Oh, here we go. Here's uh, oh, it's a that's a rabbit. Damn it

2478
04:46:21,549 --> 04:46:32,080
Okay. Well, we tried. Oh wait right here right here. Can you feed it? I did it

2479
04:46:36,939 --> 04:46:41,319
And they're just so hungry. Oh my god. Do it again, please. You have to you have to like um,

2480
04:46:41,880 --> 04:46:51,919
Crouch up to them. What are we feeding them? Uh

2481
04:46:53,020 --> 04:47:02,279
pellets

2482
04:47:02,279 --> 04:47:08,909
Uh-oh, we have a there's a predator over there. Oh, there is a wolf just walking around

2483
04:47:09,229 --> 04:47:19,720
Can you feed the wolf if you just like walk up? Can you be hand out? Don't try to feed wolves

2484
04:47:22,919 --> 04:47:24,919
Help help. I don't know what to do

2485
04:47:26,270 --> 04:47:30,560
Run to the water into the water run to the water. He's got my arm. Let's get in the water

2486
04:47:35,450 --> 04:47:39,369
Shooting a gun into the water. He won't go in the water

2487
04:47:42,619 --> 04:47:43,900
Okay

2488
04:47:43,900 --> 04:47:48,889
Yeah, I guess you're right

2489
04:47:50,250 --> 04:47:54,959
Okay, uh new toy we have a new toy there is a new toy

2490
04:47:56,080 --> 04:48:06,759
Also, they're fighting the wolf and it's not going well when he's fighting the wolf they threw three molotovs

2491
04:48:10,619 --> 04:48:13,099
Ah, yes, there is a new toy old toy

2492
04:48:18,430 --> 04:48:19,549
uh

2493
04:48:19,549 --> 04:48:22,169
Where are we gonna go?

2494
04:48:22,169 --> 04:48:26,830
That's a great question, but we're gonna go somewhere. We'll go somewhere

2495
04:48:27,389 --> 04:48:47,500
Yeah, fuck that dock. Who cares? How do I get out of here? He's all dead ends. I think they're all dead ends

2496
04:48:49,849 --> 04:48:52,080
Give me a marker

2497
04:48:52,080 --> 04:48:54,080
You're just vlogging

2498
04:48:54,080 --> 04:48:58,270
All right. Yeah, all right. I'll give you a marker. Um, we have to go this way

2499
04:49:01,240 --> 04:49:03,819
Hold on

2500
04:49:03,819 --> 04:49:05,819
honeymoon video

2501
04:49:08,479 --> 04:49:10,490
And i'll be honest with you

2502
04:49:10,490 --> 04:49:15,689
Put the phone down right like okay. Oh brothers. We're having so much fun. I'm gonna record this

2503
04:49:16,650 --> 04:49:18,810
No, don't just like enjoy the vacation right here

2504
04:49:19,610 --> 04:49:26,919
Where's the marker? There are designated things to take pictures of don't bring your phone into the water. What is that? Oh, it's an alligator

2505
04:49:30,880 --> 04:49:33,389
Uh, we should just be able to go backwards

2506
04:49:34,459 --> 04:49:35,819
Oh shit

2507
04:49:35,819 --> 04:49:38,619
What's wrong? The alligators. Oh, whoa

2508
04:49:39,580 --> 04:49:49,639
I kind of like want to see what it'll do. Honey. They're getting so close

2509
04:49:51,709 --> 04:49:52,750
Wow

2510
04:49:52,750 --> 04:49:55,869
The wildlife are here is really interesting. I love being in nature

2511
04:49:56,750 --> 04:49:58,909
I want to be out. I want to be outside all the time

2512
04:49:59,709 --> 04:50:03,610
I want to be camping. I want to be hiking

2513
04:50:03,930 --> 04:50:06,520
I want to just sunbathe. I want to go swimming

2514
04:50:07,400 --> 04:50:16,750
My camera's like broken. Oh, what's this over here? What this is?

2515
04:50:18,990 --> 04:50:20,990
Uh, I don't know

2516
04:50:25,610 --> 04:50:27,610
Let's go to like a safe

2517
04:50:27,689 --> 04:50:31,849
distance right here

2518
04:50:32,409 --> 04:50:35,049
I don't think they even care. They're stuck. Do you want to go help them?

2519
04:50:47,200 --> 04:50:52,799
Can you get on their boat and will they even care I well depends on if they notice me, I guess

2520
04:50:53,119 --> 04:51:00,990
Try to stealth up there. I think you can stealth up there and take the guy out with

2521
04:51:02,110 --> 04:51:05,470
See if you can wait see if you can go on the boat and like just sit on with them

2522
04:51:06,189 --> 04:51:12,110
What if I can do one of the like swimming machete animations where you like there's got to be one to pull a guy off the boat

2523
04:51:12,110 --> 04:51:14,110
Right. I would hope so

2524
04:51:22,200 --> 04:51:26,619
He's aiming the gun around the boat at you he doesn't want to get off

2525
04:51:27,819 --> 04:51:33,639
I see that

2526
04:51:34,200 --> 04:51:36,490
You're having your camera

2527
04:51:36,490 --> 04:51:41,450
Yeah, come over to this side around this thing. See if you can get him to like point around his left shoulder

2528
04:51:48,279 --> 04:51:49,880
Like they're just grooving

2529
04:51:49,880 --> 04:51:54,680
I feel like i'm taking a picture of you like filming a movie or doing like a photo shoot

2530
04:51:55,080 --> 04:51:57,520
Okay, they see me when I get like

2531
04:51:57,599 --> 04:52:03,279
There if I go if I go up there they can see too. So I can't will he fire the gun?

2532
04:52:03,840 --> 04:52:06,889
It's actually a good question

2533
04:52:06,889 --> 04:52:10,970
If you were to stand up like around the left side of the boat. All right about to get detected. Let's find out

2534
04:52:11,369 --> 04:52:15,099
I can't jump

2535
04:52:15,099 --> 04:52:26,279
Too i'm too puny. He can definitely fire if he wanted to right now go stand right next to him

2536
04:52:26,599 --> 04:52:32,799
I can't even like get up here. All right. Give me one sec to reset my uh

2537
04:52:33,880 --> 04:52:42,119
Stealth meter. Okay, i'm filming you i'm filming you

2538
04:52:44,729 --> 04:52:46,729
Okay, you're up there. Nice

2539
04:52:46,970 --> 04:52:56,000
very cool

2540
04:53:03,020 --> 04:53:05,020
That didn't do anything

2541
04:53:06,139 --> 04:53:08,139
Nothing killed me. What the fuck?

2542
04:53:09,479 --> 04:53:27,680
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What happened? I did like a backflip off the I hope this loads please load. Come on. We're not done yet

2543
04:53:28,319 --> 04:53:35,639
Yes

2544
04:53:35,639 --> 04:53:41,259
You're going you're going on facebook. Can we like eat these?

2545
04:53:46,430 --> 04:53:50,509
I don't think so. All right, let's go feed the uh, feed the dog. Let's actually finish that

2546
04:53:51,150 --> 04:53:58,919
Like you said I said then yep. I'm gonna call in a car

2547
04:53:59,630 --> 04:54:04,459
That would probably be useful when do I get to like call in other cars?

2548
04:54:06,459 --> 04:54:13,400
You probably have to set it find in a warehouse at the fnd storage facility complete any grand

2549
04:54:14,020 --> 04:54:29,080
Premio race or go to a chop shop. Okay. Oh my gosh. Look at this. Oh, I thought he's biting this whatever it was

2550
04:54:31,290 --> 04:54:35,099
Hey, thanks. All right, you want to drive?

2551
04:54:36,720 --> 04:54:45,049
Uh, do you okay? Yeah, you can drive. I've been driving a lot. Why is he pissed?

2552
04:54:46,860 --> 04:54:50,680
Is he yeah, he didn't he just brought the car to us and he was mad because he has to walk

2553
04:54:51,319 --> 04:54:55,000
This is unfair. Why can't oh, why can't that guy just not be in the car with us and you drop him off?

2554
04:54:55,630 --> 04:55:00,110
I don't know what happened. Yeah, there's no like other no familiar people in this game like we you can like

2555
04:55:01,470 --> 04:55:05,020
Get followers. It seems really unfair

2556
04:55:20,200 --> 04:55:21,639
What?

2557
04:55:21,639 --> 04:55:24,439
Why would you run her or she could have gotten in the car? I thought she was bad

2558
04:55:25,240 --> 04:55:27,740
She's not bad. Is this guy bad?

2559
04:55:31,450 --> 04:55:33,310
Yeah, he's bad

2560
04:55:33,310 --> 04:55:35,549
All right, pick up pick her up and let her get in the car

2561
04:55:45,770 --> 04:55:47,049
All right, let's go

2562
04:55:47,049 --> 04:55:49,630
this way

2563
04:55:49,630 --> 04:55:53,310
In the cop

2564
04:55:53,310 --> 04:55:55,790
Point your phone out the window like a hipster vlog

2565
04:55:56,430 --> 04:56:00,000
She's not getting in the car

2566
04:56:00,000 --> 04:56:10,319
Can I lean out?

2567
04:56:10,319 --> 04:56:22,409
Okay, let's just go take you out

2568
04:56:23,049 --> 04:56:28,479
Good. Excellent

2569
04:56:28,479 --> 04:56:30,479
Can you do a selfie? I don't think so

2570
04:56:32,000 --> 04:56:34,080
put away zoom toggle ui

2571
04:56:35,040 --> 04:56:36,400
No, you can't

2572
04:56:36,400 --> 04:56:48,479
What happened there?

2573
04:56:48,479 --> 04:56:50,479
Why is there a skull flying around in the sky?

2574
04:56:51,040 --> 04:56:54,459
There's a skull in the sky. I think that means there's like a

2575
04:56:55,180 --> 04:56:58,380
It's not a new sea of thieves event. I don't know. I never played it

2576
04:56:59,259 --> 04:57:02,599
Probably where jack black is

2577
04:57:02,599 --> 04:57:07,130
I said, I wouldn't be surprised if this is just the last game flipped upside down

2578
04:57:08,319 --> 04:57:11,599
Well, they just like flip horizontally every asset

2579
04:57:15,790 --> 04:57:17,790
They broke my tires

2580
04:57:20,959 --> 04:57:37,720
Where's the other guy I don't see anybody where are they anybody marked?

2581
04:57:39,000 --> 04:57:41,080
No, I don't we're not are we marking people

2582
04:57:46,680 --> 04:57:52,279
They got planes do if we we just gotta leave because they got the alarm run run run out. There's gonna be more people

2583
04:57:54,270 --> 04:57:59,630
It's only gonna get exacerbated. I'm good. It is explosives back here. Just be aware of that be careful. I have almost zero health

2584
04:58:00,430 --> 04:58:03,740
I'm dead

2585
04:58:03,740 --> 04:58:09,209
I can't get out of the fucking back seat of this car

2586
04:58:10,090 --> 04:58:25,049
I'm just running. I'm sorry. You'll spawn on me. All right, i'm out. Oh, there's a spectator bug

2587
04:58:25,529 --> 04:58:32,889
All right, I got away

2588
04:58:32,889 --> 04:58:35,049
I wonder if when you do you you probably just spawn right on me

2589
04:58:39,799 --> 04:58:41,799
And we're

2590
04:58:42,619 --> 04:58:45,680
Back. Yeah, that's a much better idea

2591
04:58:46,400 --> 04:58:48,959
What the fuck is this thing?

2592
04:58:48,959 --> 04:58:50,080
ferret

2593
04:58:50,080 --> 04:58:53,000
Why is it mad?

2594
04:58:53,000 --> 04:58:55,200
What did I do?

2595
04:58:55,200 --> 04:58:58,340
Because humans have corrupted their natural environments

2596
04:58:59,119 --> 04:59:02,650
There's a mongoose

2597
04:59:02,650 --> 04:59:11,020
What are you shooting at?

2598
04:59:11,340 --> 04:59:14,990
What's even down there? I'm just gonna get a car

2599
04:59:16,759 --> 04:59:19,880
Found one hold on this guy have a quest

2600
04:59:22,970 --> 04:59:28,119
Holy shit

2601
04:59:28,119 --> 04:59:33,310
No, don't shoot me

2602
04:59:33,310 --> 04:59:42,270
All right, I get it. I'm in. All right, let's head. We're just trying to feed the goddamn dachshund. Okay

2603
04:59:43,229 --> 05:00:00,299
Helicopter you turn it around of course a tank

2604
05:00:02,619 --> 05:00:03,819
He's aiming

2605
05:00:03,819 --> 05:00:06,569
He ain't gonna hit him. He's not he's aiming

2606
05:00:08,729 --> 05:00:11,770
I'd be surprised he literally just disappeared off the map. We're good

2607
05:00:13,439 --> 05:00:27,840
They tend to do that

2608
05:00:27,840 --> 05:00:29,840
Are you yet? No, I

2609
05:00:30,810 --> 05:00:31,689
Oh

2610
05:00:31,689 --> 05:00:33,849
I just I did the waypoints wrong

2611
05:00:38,990 --> 05:00:42,349
I was trying to cut through here because the waypoint is taking us somewhere else

2612
05:00:45,560 --> 05:00:49,259
Look at the this is the wrong way. We need to put the waypoint waypoint

2613
05:00:51,340 --> 05:00:55,740
Okay, i'll give you some waypoints because i'm driving towards this waypoint here. You see my waypoint

2614
05:00:57,799 --> 05:00:58,919
Yeah, it's it

2615
05:00:58,919 --> 05:01:06,380
So now we have to go this way

2616
05:01:06,380 --> 05:01:15,849
All right, the moment that everyone's been waiting for

2617
05:01:16,009 --> 05:01:19,069
It's finally among us

2618
05:01:19,069 --> 05:01:21,209
Why why?

2619
05:01:21,209 --> 05:01:24,009
I can't say two words that are very common together

2620
05:01:24,729 --> 05:01:26,779
without it being

2621
05:01:26,779 --> 05:01:30,060
A video game everybody likes. I don't think it contextually even made sense

2622
05:01:41,740 --> 05:01:46,880
You know, you're probably right

2623
05:01:46,880 --> 05:01:49,180
What am I doing?

2624
05:01:49,180 --> 05:01:50,779
Excuse me

2625
05:01:50,779 --> 05:01:58,970
Why did this happen?

2626
05:01:58,970 --> 05:02:00,970
Okay. Well, let's go feed the dog

2627
05:02:07,880 --> 05:02:12,680
I am so ready for this

2628
05:02:12,759 --> 05:02:14,040
feeding the dog

2629
05:02:14,040 --> 05:02:16,139
Crocodile steak

2630
05:02:16,139 --> 05:02:19,020
Are you okay? Are you gonna be able to see it? I think so

2631
05:02:19,740 --> 05:02:21,740
As long as i'm close probably, right?

2632
05:02:26,540 --> 05:02:29,159
So hard for my god

2633
05:02:30,040 --> 05:02:40,330
Should be enough to make us amigos, right? We did it. He's so hungry

2634
05:02:45,279 --> 05:02:47,279
He's no you have to eat the rest of the food

2635
05:02:48,159 --> 05:02:50,560
I he doesn't want to buy you the good stuff. You have to eat the rest of it

2636
05:02:51,200 --> 05:02:52,319
but

2637
05:02:52,319 --> 05:02:54,319
Not hungry. It's okay

2638
05:02:57,959 --> 05:02:59,709
Wait

2639
05:02:59,709 --> 05:03:01,180
um

2640
05:03:01,180 --> 05:03:05,740
Chorizo has something to show you. Where is it? What is it? I should follow him to find out really

2641
05:03:06,540 --> 05:03:11,130
What are you doing? You want me to okay? Oh, let's go

2642
05:03:11,930 --> 05:03:21,259
What you got there now for me? Oh shit

2643
05:03:22,060 --> 05:03:29,340
diamonds

2644
05:03:29,500 --> 05:03:36,720
Keep following him. Yeah, he navigates this uh ramp pretty well

2645
05:03:46,650 --> 05:03:50,169
Dogs been stealing shit through the whole community and like burying it in corners

2646
05:04:00,299 --> 05:04:05,040
Even more well that wasn't really hidden

2647
05:04:06,680 --> 05:04:08,680
It was just on the counter serious key

2648
05:04:18,520 --> 05:04:21,560
Okay, but like what if he was one of the attack companions?

2649
05:04:22,360 --> 05:04:26,360
He's so funny

2650
05:04:32,830 --> 05:04:35,709
He just moves this slowly around is messing around he's walking around

2651
05:04:44,400 --> 05:04:46,400
He is

2652
05:04:46,560 --> 05:04:48,000
Now he's not

2653
05:04:48,000 --> 05:04:51,450
He probably helped you steal this shit

2654
05:04:53,049 --> 05:04:56,650
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. He's got a name tag

2655
05:04:57,209 --> 05:04:59,439
Really?

2656
05:04:59,439 --> 05:05:01,520
Yeah, so you can equip his name tag

2657
05:05:02,080 --> 05:05:05,849
That way you remember him anywhere you go

2658
05:05:07,360 --> 05:05:10,159
Just put like a cute dachshund in your game and everyone won't care about

2659
05:05:11,040 --> 05:05:13,840
Just connecting with their friend like two times in a row

2660
05:05:17,049 --> 05:05:23,200
Very nice. Oh shit

2661
05:05:25,560 --> 05:05:43,900
It's real really hold on. How do you do it? Hang on. Where is he? This is pet. I can't do it

2662
05:05:43,900 --> 05:05:46,139
It's his pet chorizo

2663
05:05:46,139 --> 05:05:51,639
Where is he?

2664
05:05:51,639 --> 05:05:58,750
I don't see him yet

2665
05:05:58,750 --> 05:06:03,229
Pepe laugh co-op. Are you kidding me?

2666
05:06:03,869 --> 05:06:09,500
Oh, it's on cooldown. I can't even get the dog

2667
05:06:11,849 --> 05:06:17,209
I'm just like trapped. I'm trapped like in a mirror or something. Like I know here's what it is. Um

2668
05:06:17,849 --> 05:06:21,610
You're holding the controller that's not plugged

2669
05:06:24,000 --> 05:06:27,040
And pretending like you're playing while i'm playing

2670
05:06:30,000 --> 05:06:31,360
What the fuck?

2671
05:06:31,360 --> 05:06:42,479
All right, let's keep going. How are you doing? You're you doing good. You're right. I'm good

2672
05:06:42,560 --> 05:06:45,680
I just I just got our our little friend who actually exists

2673
05:06:47,520 --> 05:06:51,180
Here he is. Oh my goodness. I can't believe it

2674
05:06:53,259 --> 05:06:55,259
I can't believe you can actually you but but

2675
05:06:55,819 --> 05:06:57,659
what if he gets like

2676
05:06:57,659 --> 05:07:03,020
Attacked he's gonna get like a you're gonna throw a grenade and it's gonna be bad. Just go to sleep in the puddle

2677
05:07:05,470 --> 05:07:08,590
He's sleeping inside of the mud puddle. We have to protect

2678
05:07:09,229 --> 05:07:10,830
This dog at all costs

2679
05:07:10,830 --> 05:07:20,619
All right, bring the spurs back. All right, where's the crafting bench? Let's make some new toys. We'll complete this first

2680
05:07:21,180 --> 05:07:22,939
because we we've had this

2681
05:07:22,939 --> 05:07:24,939
Pretty much completed for like an hour

2682
05:07:38,040 --> 05:07:40,799
I just can't stand the idea

2683
05:07:47,900 --> 05:07:54,650
Now you did us a favor and I trust you but if you say anything to anyone

2684
05:07:55,369 --> 05:08:02,029
I'll fuck you up a challenger approaches

2685
05:08:03,709 --> 05:08:06,189
What's my reward

2686
05:08:06,189 --> 05:08:08,250
Give my quest reward

2687
05:08:08,250 --> 05:08:10,250
You think I did that the goodest of my heart?

2688
05:08:11,740 --> 05:08:13,819
We got it right there. Look gonna be rank four

2689
05:08:17,369 --> 05:08:20,650
Okay, new weapons and gear at arms daily, let's go look at some new weapons

2690
05:08:24,060 --> 05:08:26,060
Uh, we should be able to craft some shit

2691
05:08:27,720 --> 05:08:30,759
Well, you should be able to craft some shit in your cool game that you have

2692
05:08:31,240 --> 05:08:36,279
No, you can't anybody can craft stuff. We just gotta find the crafting table. No, I can't I know I can't I can't I can't

2693
05:08:38,349 --> 05:08:42,110
I can't I don't even want to look mentally. No, I can't I don't even want to look it's stupid. I can't do it

2694
05:08:53,360 --> 05:08:55,360
I actually don't think I can

2695
05:08:57,470 --> 05:08:59,470
I can go I can can I talk to this guy?

2696
05:09:00,810 --> 05:09:04,569
Listen i'll just I could throw one of my weapons on the ground and you can pick it up

2697
05:09:05,369 --> 05:09:08,169
Uh, it's all right, man. I just uh, that's fine. It's cool

2698
05:09:09,049 --> 05:09:11,930
As I can't do it. I genuinely don't even know where the crafting bench is

2699
05:09:13,479 --> 05:09:17,240
Yeah, just make a bunch of like shit. Whatever. It's fine. I don't care. Yeah, you know what? Um

2700
05:09:18,040 --> 05:09:19,080
um

2701
05:09:19,080 --> 05:09:21,240
It is it is more fun with my 15 game

2702
05:09:23,520 --> 05:09:27,919
All right, that means fucking it's like low low price of 15 dollars, you know, it's pretty good deal

2703
05:09:30,299 --> 05:09:32,299
Sorry, just make something fucking whatever

2704
05:09:36,159 --> 05:09:45,040
Yeah

2705
05:09:45,040 --> 05:09:48,430
Oh fucking probably uh

2706
05:09:49,159 --> 05:09:55,479
I'm building my i'm building my base. Yeah. Hang on. I gotta wait for your approval though. You said no

2707
05:09:56,680 --> 05:10:00,599
You need uh, you need my approval. Okay, let me um, let me deliberate on this

2708
05:10:06,139 --> 05:10:23,770
Oh, this is I thought this was gonna sell weapons. They sell clothes clothes

2709
05:10:28,990 --> 05:10:30,590
I'll give you one sec

2710
05:10:30,590 --> 05:10:33,869
Got a raid from uh chibli. Thanks for the raid chibli

2711
05:10:36,279 --> 05:10:38,279
What's going on everybody? Thanks for joining

2712
05:10:38,680 --> 05:10:46,650
Playing far cry six my buddy italics. How are you guys doing?

2713
05:10:49,549 --> 05:10:59,209
I have italics muted in deafens and he probably doesn't know what's going on. But thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody. So um,

2714
05:11:00,970 --> 05:11:03,389
Where do you want to go from here? What would you like to do?

2715
05:11:05,200 --> 05:11:07,680
uh

2716
05:11:07,680 --> 05:11:11,919
I'll let you choose because I feel like um, you know, my my game's kind of better than yours

2717
05:11:11,919 --> 05:11:17,770
I've got the the dachshund dog pet. Um, I got a premium weapons. I've got the

2718
05:11:18,970 --> 05:11:23,369
Awesome clothes. Yeah, I mean it's it's a better game mary guy. It's a cooler game

2719
05:11:23,450 --> 05:11:28,569
But I think like we can do what you kind of feel like because you're the one that has to be the quarterback here

2720
05:11:31,880 --> 05:11:36,439
Yeah, you do have a point. I mean anything we do really doesn't impact your save at all

2721
05:11:37,470 --> 05:11:41,630
Um, even though you own the game and uh, I technically i'm renting it. So

2722
05:11:43,069 --> 05:11:46,110
No, let's go do uh, let's go. I want to fly a plane. I want to be in a plane

2723
05:11:46,349 --> 05:11:48,830
Somebody just somebody just throw a glass at the dog

2724
05:11:49,869 --> 05:11:57,400
Who the fuck just did that who did that? All right, let's go fly a plane spawn a plane and I want to fly it

2725
05:11:58,220 --> 05:12:00,250
Okay

2726
05:12:00,250 --> 05:12:04,639
just

2727
05:12:04,639 --> 05:12:06,639
What's this controller icon?

2728
05:12:11,759 --> 05:12:14,759
I don't wait. What is it? Yeah indirect. Oh

2729
05:12:15,319 --> 05:12:22,270
It's uh their dlc aren't these just characters from the other games?

2730
05:12:22,830 --> 05:12:27,790
Yeah, I think that for some reason is somehow the also you okay if you don't move

2731
05:12:27,869 --> 05:12:34,270
I literally can't finish the game like if you went afk right here. Yeah, I am 100% boxed in

2732
05:12:35,229 --> 05:12:37,229
Really

2733
05:12:37,389 --> 05:12:43,720
There's no jumping in this mug you just stuck you just you just put me in a minecraft like dirt

2734
05:12:44,459 --> 05:12:49,759
Dark hut while I was uh using the bathroom. Oh, all right. Let's get in the plane

2735
05:12:50,080 --> 05:13:04,430
What time is right now? When do we start too? I got like another 40 minutes in me. Let's get let's get some new vehicles and weapons

2736
05:13:04,669 --> 05:13:09,979
We gotta get new toys. I'm I like I can't there's a crafting bench in there somewhere

2737
05:13:09,979 --> 05:13:10,939
I don't know where it is

2738
05:13:10,939 --> 05:13:19,790
There's a helicopter now or there was then but there is now too and we have two can we have two different vehicles

2739
05:13:20,360 --> 05:13:22,520
Okay, so uh you you want the plane?

2740
05:13:23,000 --> 05:13:27,319
Why don't we know I want the helicopter? Okay, well pick pick one. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2741
05:13:27,639 --> 05:13:33,259
Let's try the shield thing. That's a good idea. How are we gonna do this?

2742
05:13:33,740 --> 05:13:35,740
Where are you gonna be? I'm just gonna go to the end of the runway

2743
05:13:41,880 --> 05:13:48,840
I have to like pitch this down then all right. The plane is currently moving so I can't really stop it

2744
05:13:49,000 --> 05:13:51,229
All right, just accelerate. All right. Here we go

2745
05:13:59,959 --> 05:14:04,569
Not bad time didn't save me that time. I'm all right

2746
05:14:07,900 --> 05:14:09,900
Spawn in here. Yeah

2747
05:14:11,549 --> 05:14:16,990
Like round you up. All right, where to can't you like a grapple onto stuff?

2748
05:14:18,540 --> 05:14:20,779
That's the grapple still in the game. That's just cause

2749
05:14:21,659 --> 05:14:28,220
No, no, no, that's far cry five was we were doing like a grapple onto the helicopter. Remember we were trying to like um

2750
05:14:29,900 --> 05:14:31,419
Do the physics bounce?

2751
05:14:31,419 --> 05:14:34,700
Oh, I don't know. Maybe if the helicopter blades probably have to unlock it

2752
05:14:35,259 --> 05:14:41,310
So i'm going to a waypoint right now. What's this waypoint for?

2753
05:14:50,840 --> 05:14:56,860
I don't I don't know what to do. I'm panicking. I actually don't I like forgot how to drive the fucking plane. I don't know what to do

2754
05:14:58,650 --> 05:15:01,049
Why can't I not move my mouth? I can't move my mouth

2755
05:15:01,689 --> 05:15:03,689
Just get out just get out just get out

2756
05:15:04,569 --> 05:15:14,810
You're good

2757
05:15:14,810 --> 05:15:20,520
Yes

2758
05:15:20,520 --> 05:15:26,319
Did you shoot at me? How are you so much higher than me? All right, try and shoot this

2759
05:15:33,119 --> 05:15:34,909
I can't look down

2760
05:15:34,909 --> 05:15:39,319
There you are. I'm gonna try to i'm gonna try and make a cool landing in front of you. Okay?

2761
05:15:40,250 --> 05:15:57,560
Okay, just stay still we get this on camera, right? Like pull out your camera. All right, here we come

2762
05:15:59,740 --> 05:16:10,200
That's it. It doesn't look like you're going towards me. I am I never vibe me. That was fun

2763
05:16:10,599 --> 05:16:21,770
I was gonna try to land on your camera lens, but that would have been really really probably impossible to do

2764
05:16:22,009 --> 05:16:24,009
I I didn't even have the camera out

2765
05:16:24,939 --> 05:16:26,840
And what happened there?

2766
05:16:26,840 --> 05:16:29,080
He just walked right into my trap

2767
05:16:29,080 --> 05:16:33,959
I set that up like I was waiting for you to like land there so I could blow you up when you when you landed

2768
05:16:34,040 --> 05:16:36,040
But since you didn't land there

2769
05:16:36,279 --> 05:16:41,229
I had to leave the trap out so that then you just ran right over it. I couldn't pass up the opportunity

2770
05:16:41,950 --> 05:16:44,270
Yeah

2771
05:16:44,270 --> 05:16:56,799
I had to salvage it. It's okay. I made sure chorizo was oh my the explosion. I got blood

2772
05:16:56,880 --> 05:17:02,939
Oh, no, that's disgusting. I've got the blood all over my hands. That's gross. He's healing the wounds

2773
05:17:06,700 --> 05:17:10,380
All right. What do you want to do for the last like 30 40 minutes to an hour or something? Uh,

2774
05:17:13,599 --> 05:17:17,680
Let's take a look. We're gonna we're gonna give ourselves an objective. I don't think we even have one

2775
05:17:20,860 --> 05:17:21,500
How do okay?

2776
05:17:21,500 --> 05:17:27,500
We need to figure out how to build the gorilla garrison because like everything fun is locked behind the gorilla garrison

2777
05:17:28,700 --> 05:17:30,939
There's we got there's rocket launchers

2778
05:17:32,000 --> 05:17:33,840
There's bows

2779
05:17:33,840 --> 05:17:39,439
There's like seven shotguns four sniper rifles like every single thing is tied to that

2780
05:17:39,680 --> 05:17:44,439
Okay, but do we have any indicator where to go for that?

2781
05:17:48,159 --> 05:17:55,159
Uh, I think it's supposed to be in the camp, but I probably already like I don't know what's down here

2782
05:17:56,569 --> 05:17:59,529
You can find them in military out installations, too

2783
05:17:59,849 --> 05:18:06,220
Because there's this cortina weather station military target vehicle pickup points

2784
05:18:08,729 --> 05:18:18,490
There is this one over here, which is the tobacco factory military target there's a town over here

2785
05:18:22,459 --> 05:18:27,259
You can't turn the stream off until you get on an airplane and try to just fly to the bad guy's hq to kill him

2786
05:18:30,330 --> 05:18:37,400
Um, we'll try that alex you up for a challenge to like just fly

2787
05:18:37,799 --> 05:18:42,880
Across to the to rank eight and try to kill the guy with like a sniper headshot in the head fly to rank eight

2788
05:18:44,090 --> 05:18:49,389
Yeah, just fly across. Okay. Sure. Where's the guy? All right, so hit go to your map. Uh-huh

2789
05:18:50,029 --> 05:18:55,869
Uh, oh like the top. Yeah, just go fly to his like compound. Um

2790
05:18:56,430 --> 05:19:06,080
El presidente we'll just get in a plane. You're gonna drive because you're much better than I am. Okay fly across this

2791
05:19:06,639 --> 05:19:15,529
This is gonna be like day z level travel time. I mean we could try it

2792
05:19:15,529 --> 05:19:19,450
Maybe we can maybe if we fly like out of bounds or something we can fly around and land

2793
05:19:19,689 --> 05:19:33,049
Okay, try it. I didn't mean to click that. All right. Well, how do we get how do we get a plane?

2794
05:19:34,970 --> 05:19:36,169
Yeah, that's restricted airspace

2795
05:19:36,169 --> 05:19:39,369
But can we like avoid the restricted airspace by flying like around the ocean or something?

2796
05:19:47,610 --> 05:19:52,750
I think we probably need to fast travel. What about like a um, what about like a jet ski? That might work

2797
05:19:56,380 --> 05:19:59,599
Yeah, maybe a jet ski might do it if we go to the dock here

2798
05:20:02,720 --> 05:20:05,680
You actually might be onto something seriously if we go around the entire map here

2799
05:20:06,080 --> 05:20:13,130
Okay, let's go west to that marker. I'll call in just like a regular car

2800
05:20:18,619 --> 05:20:21,099
And then the marker there's like a dock there could be a boat

2801
05:20:26,729 --> 05:20:32,729
Okay, this is kind of stupid turn around run down this hill and slide like down down the slope and just hold

2802
05:20:33,849 --> 05:20:37,069
Well, that's fun

2803
05:20:37,069 --> 05:20:43,200
You can almost do the entire go. Okay. Let's go

2804
05:20:43,919 --> 05:20:48,009
You guys are gonna stop the whole war

2805
05:20:50,400 --> 05:20:54,479
I mean, we're gonna see what happens. It's worth a shot a few good minutes

2806
05:20:55,040 --> 05:21:05,159
Why does it always end up like this?

2807
05:21:05,159 --> 05:21:13,450
It always ends up like this

2808
05:21:13,450 --> 05:21:19,849
okay, and

2809
05:21:20,169 --> 05:21:25,290
I'm kind of just hoping that there is a boat of some kind right? Yeah spike strips

2810
05:21:34,040 --> 05:21:36,040
This car is not doing very well

2811
05:21:37,400 --> 05:21:39,880
But nice job dodges. I just dodged the spike strips

2812
05:21:40,759 --> 05:21:43,080
Smoking a little bit though for some did we get shot?

2813
05:21:43,880 --> 05:21:45,400
I think we may have

2814
05:21:45,400 --> 05:21:56,639
Is there a third person view? I don't think so only in the camp

2815
05:22:01,549 --> 05:22:03,549
That guy spawned and you killed him

2816
05:22:05,759 --> 05:22:11,439
Okay, it just occurred to me that little chorizo I spoke turn little chorizo is like following us

2817
05:22:12,000 --> 05:22:15,580
Yeah, just running on the road

2818
05:22:15,580 --> 05:22:18,380
If you can like do a wheelie on the slopes

2819
05:22:29,599 --> 05:22:31,709
Very nice

2820
05:22:31,709 --> 05:22:33,450
That's a cowl

2821
05:22:33,450 --> 05:22:35,450
I thought that was a routine bison

2822
05:22:43,500 --> 05:22:45,900
Those windshield wipers are sure helping us right now

2823
05:22:47,049 --> 05:22:48,650
Keeping the smoke down

2824
05:22:48,650 --> 05:22:51,479
Just to flip

2825
05:22:51,479 --> 05:22:55,240
I was okay. I didn't realize there was a ditch. I was just trying to cut across the grass

2826
05:23:06,619 --> 05:23:09,580
All right, we're almost at water. We're almost there. Oh

2827
05:23:10,139 --> 05:23:12,759
We just to make it to the water

2828
05:23:13,000 --> 05:23:15,000
And oh jesus

2829
05:23:15,709 --> 05:23:17,389
Uh-oh

2830
05:23:17,389 --> 05:23:19,630
Uh, hey come come look at me. All right

2831
05:23:20,509 --> 05:23:25,279
All right. Here's your this is your opportunity go go to the rank eight area and die

2832
05:23:32,139 --> 05:23:34,299
Your body is gone, but your arms are still there

2833
05:23:35,099 --> 05:23:37,099
And you if you swim this way

2834
05:23:40,360 --> 05:23:41,880
You're gonna drown

2835
05:23:41,880 --> 05:23:44,119
No, I my head's above water right now. Is it?

2836
05:23:44,680 --> 05:23:45,560
Yeah

2837
05:23:45,560 --> 05:23:49,799
I could I could be here as long as actually there may not be a way out except drowning

2838
05:23:50,439 --> 05:23:53,310
I'm gonna help you under water though. But if I go under water

2839
05:23:54,110 --> 05:24:00,110
It's a boat over here

2840
05:24:00,509 --> 05:24:15,979
Hang on. I might be able to there's a boat right here. Hold on

2841
05:24:18,240 --> 05:24:24,090
What happened? I'm swimming back up. Are you dying?

2842
05:24:25,130 --> 05:24:26,750
I got a boat. I'm

2843
05:24:28,029 --> 05:24:30,029
Uh-oh now i'm gonna drown

2844
05:24:30,029 --> 05:24:32,430
All right, it's fine. You uh, we're gonna repair this shit

2845
05:24:32,990 --> 05:24:34,990
I'm just under the world

2846
05:24:36,549 --> 05:24:41,049
Grasping for air like a horror movie like I can see reality fourth dimensional

2847
05:24:41,610 --> 05:24:46,810
Through the bookcases and I can see you in the boat having fun and i'm like struggling to get to you

2848
05:24:47,849 --> 05:24:49,849
Alex this boat has a machine gun

2849
05:24:51,099 --> 05:24:53,099
Really? We need to be very aware of that

2850
05:24:53,340 --> 05:24:57,500
Whoa, I think we're gonna be able to get out. I think I think this is the one. It's actually a good boat

2851
05:24:57,740 --> 05:25:00,560
It's really good boat

2852
05:25:00,639 --> 05:25:07,020
And we got to go

2853
05:25:07,020 --> 05:25:09,069
I'm right i'm here

2854
05:25:09,069 --> 05:25:10,750
Okay, we're gonna

2855
05:25:10,750 --> 05:25:12,110
I hate you

2856
05:25:12,110 --> 05:25:15,229
So you're gonna go right we're gonna hit an invisible wall

2857
05:25:15,790 --> 05:25:17,389
Follow the coastline

2858
05:25:17,389 --> 05:25:19,389
We're gonna hit an invisible wall. I think

2859
05:25:19,389 --> 05:25:24,619
Am I going straight here self-defense you go right outside the this little opening

2860
05:25:29,740 --> 05:25:34,139
Somebody just had a sailboat out here. I don't think that's a sailboat. I think they're like coming to get us

2861
05:25:34,540 --> 05:25:35,659
Are they?

2862
05:25:35,659 --> 05:25:37,819
The guy on the left is the guy on the left is

2863
05:25:39,020 --> 05:25:41,020
Hey, you gotta you got a gun

2864
05:25:41,259 --> 05:25:42,619
I do

2865
05:25:42,619 --> 05:25:44,700
You gotta go you gotta drive. I'm going

2866
05:25:45,500 --> 05:25:56,959
There's too much smoke. Oh shit. There's a lot of machine gun boats out here

2867
05:25:57,520 --> 05:26:00,720
There are yeah, this is their way to make it so you don't come over here

2868
05:26:01,520 --> 05:26:09,720
So how far do we need to go?

2869
05:26:09,720 --> 05:26:11,720
Oh, I mean you just keep going

2870
05:26:13,049 --> 05:26:15,689
There's almost no end in sight. I can't look at my map. All right

2871
05:26:18,270 --> 05:26:20,270
Oh, Jesus. Okay

2872
05:26:20,349 --> 05:26:23,610
I'll set a marker for

2873
05:26:23,610 --> 05:26:26,650
I actually can't set markers. I don't think you can no no

2874
05:26:29,959 --> 05:26:31,959
It's like this is an illegal zone

2875
05:26:33,310 --> 05:26:38,750
We're we're beyond the veil at this point as long as we can just trace the outside. I think we'd be fine

2876
05:26:39,630 --> 05:26:50,680
I hope they've run into a destroyer and get vaporized. Hey

2877
05:26:51,479 --> 05:27:01,279
We're doing the uh, what's that rpg where you can win the game?

2878
05:27:02,650 --> 05:27:04,569
like in the in the opening segments like

2879
05:27:05,369 --> 05:27:07,450
Gothic or something. Yeah, something like that

2880
05:27:08,409 --> 05:27:11,869
Whether you just like sprint as fast you can to this one town and like kill the guy

2881
05:27:19,310 --> 05:27:21,389
All right, if we can actually kill the

2882
05:27:22,509 --> 05:27:24,040
Boss

2883
05:27:24,040 --> 05:27:26,040
I don't think he'll even be on the map

2884
05:27:27,659 --> 05:27:32,860
Do even like because we know what region he's in but do we know like we know what his house is. Yeah

2885
05:27:36,409 --> 05:27:39,610
It's probably gonna be a big building it's probably gonna be very clear

2886
05:27:40,490 --> 05:27:45,799
What do you think the odds are that they um?

2887
05:27:47,319 --> 05:27:50,680
Have something that's even better than tanks and choppers probably pretty high right?

2888
05:27:50,680 --> 05:27:56,919
You're about to drive a into an island and b into the bad guys into an island. I got plenty of room

2889
05:27:57,720 --> 05:28:03,659
I got plenty of room. I'm fine

2890
05:28:03,740 --> 05:28:08,060
Just confirm with me that i'm going the right way. I mean they'll look the ai beached their boat

2891
05:28:08,139 --> 05:28:10,139
I'm just saying anything's possible. Okay

2892
05:28:12,490 --> 05:28:13,840
What?

2893
05:28:13,840 --> 05:28:17,419
What what?

2894
05:28:17,419 --> 05:28:19,659
What are you talking about? No get out and push what?

2895
05:28:20,540 --> 05:28:38,090
Just push it. We'll be fine. We can push a little bit more. I think that's okay

2896
05:28:38,650 --> 05:28:43,290
I think we're good

2897
05:28:43,369 --> 05:28:45,610
How did you board this from the edges?

2898
05:28:51,259 --> 05:28:57,040
Where are we? We are actually way closer than I thought we were gonna be we're almost there

2899
05:28:58,889 --> 05:29:01,150
We're like halfway there. Yeah

2900
05:29:01,150 --> 05:29:04,830
Are you gonna are you gonna take the right and go through a little inlet like the little um?

2901
05:29:06,380 --> 05:29:10,540
Oh god, no, we're going that way. Yeah, go around go around tall side. Can you move?

2902
05:29:11,180 --> 05:29:13,659
Yeah, okay, because you're

2903
05:29:14,860 --> 05:29:20,240
An asshole kill him kill him kill him kill this guy

2904
05:29:21,119 --> 05:29:24,509
I

2905
05:29:25,389 --> 05:29:27,389
Beeped at him and he fucking whatever

2906
05:29:28,349 --> 05:29:33,639
He'll just got to kill that guy

2907
05:29:33,639 --> 05:29:35,639
Nice good good work

2908
05:29:41,959 --> 05:29:46,680
Okay, but like boating accidents actually happen like that

2909
05:29:48,270 --> 05:29:51,950
Wow like this you have so much space you go anywhere

2910
05:29:52,669 --> 05:29:54,669
And you're the only other

2911
05:29:55,580 --> 05:30:01,659
Like oil tanker spills

2912
05:30:01,659 --> 05:30:04,599
All right, we're almost there

2913
05:30:04,599 --> 05:30:07,639
Look, we have to we have to be really tactical. We have to be really stealthy too

2914
05:30:08,200 --> 05:30:12,680
No bullshit. No like flying laugh out loud helicopters into the walls or whatever

2915
05:30:12,680 --> 05:30:15,080
No, we're gonna get there and we're gonna sneak to this guy's compound and

2916
05:30:15,799 --> 05:30:17,799
One of us is gonna snipe rival in the head

2917
05:30:18,040 --> 05:30:21,770
All right. I'm gonna I see like a haze on the horizon

2918
05:30:21,770 --> 05:30:25,450
You should probably like veer right a little bit so we don't hit some like water wall

2919
05:30:26,330 --> 05:30:32,270
Do they know dude that guy's got a better gun. That's a better boat

2920
05:30:33,639 --> 05:30:37,720
Far away or is it the same one? Is this same boat or almost sir? I was gonna go. It's just right away

2921
05:30:38,439 --> 05:30:40,119
All right, just keep going

2922
05:30:40,119 --> 05:30:47,130
All right. So you guide me a little bit here because I don't know exactly where i'm going. Okay, you're gonna go. Um

2923
05:30:50,270 --> 05:30:52,040
just kind of

2924
05:30:52,040 --> 05:30:53,740
turn

2925
05:30:53,740 --> 05:30:59,580
To the right side of that island and just kind of follow like this way. Yeah, just follow that

2926
05:31:00,299 --> 05:31:04,479
It's gonna be an lol laughing about a moment

2927
05:31:06,279 --> 05:31:15,229
I know

2928
05:31:15,229 --> 05:31:17,229
So, okay rank is just

2929
05:31:18,599 --> 05:31:22,200
How hard it is relative to your equipment? I believe so

2930
05:31:23,240 --> 05:31:25,959
They they kind of like turned to far cry into an rpg

2931
05:31:26,919 --> 05:31:29,240
Weirdly, we're not supposed to be in this zone

2932
05:31:29,880 --> 05:31:32,200
Yeah, like you have to have okay you have to have the right like

2933
05:31:33,639 --> 05:31:36,520
Level up guns like health bars and all that shit

2934
05:31:41,119 --> 05:31:42,799
All right. So this looks like

2935
05:31:42,799 --> 05:31:44,880
this zone on the right here, I think is

2936
05:31:45,919 --> 05:31:47,200
Zone

2937
05:31:47,200 --> 05:31:50,319
You think it's just that tall building that like kind of cathedral looking building right there

2938
05:31:52,970 --> 05:31:55,689
It actually probably is. Yeah, I assume right

2939
05:32:01,549 --> 05:32:03,709
One of them is a is like a huge hotel

2940
05:32:05,840 --> 05:32:08,080
Okay, so you watch like the first big few

2941
05:32:11,229 --> 05:32:15,040
push

2942
05:32:15,040 --> 05:32:17,040
It's it's the only

2943
05:32:17,520 --> 05:32:19,520
Piece of land here. Of course it is

2944
05:32:19,680 --> 05:32:22,110
There are sharks everywhere. So just be

2945
05:32:22,590 --> 05:32:26,509
Oh my god, we'll go push it. Push it a lot push it. Push it. Push it. Push it. This is bad

2946
05:32:30,759 --> 05:32:36,669
Is this drivable yet? Oh not yet

2947
05:32:37,470 --> 05:32:52,669
Can you drive it? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I can't get him

2948
05:32:55,400 --> 05:33:00,520
I can't get in

2949
05:33:00,520 --> 05:33:05,080
Take their boat take their boat take their I mean i've already shot the hell it's sinking. No, it's not like me

2950
05:33:06,040 --> 05:33:07,319
You can repair it

2951
05:33:07,319 --> 05:33:14,619
There's those sharks are are everywhere. This I mean, I think this one will drive

2952
05:33:15,419 --> 05:33:20,400
You can repair this one

2953
05:33:20,400 --> 05:33:33,689
This is a sure thing. This is absolutely a sure thing. Do I hear a dog a dog?

2954
05:33:37,240 --> 05:33:39,240
Uh, they're like raw

2955
05:33:39,580 --> 05:33:46,380
Why is a baby dog in the waters paddle doing the doggy paddle? He's just in the water. Yeah, he's just in the water

2956
05:33:52,110 --> 05:33:55,880
Ammo

2957
05:33:55,880 --> 05:34:06,459
Get this thing out of here. All right, come to my boat. It's in a good spot. I will protect you

2958
05:34:06,459 --> 05:34:08,459
I'll make sure I shoot the sharks that come near you

2959
05:34:14,970 --> 05:34:17,450
Okay, i'm on your boat. Very good. All right

2960
05:34:18,169 --> 05:34:22,139
Be careful. We don't want to hit the same piece of land

2961
05:34:24,250 --> 05:34:26,619
Very nice. All right. Good. What was that?

2962
05:34:27,259 --> 05:34:29,259
Uh, apparently there is a vehicle weapon

2963
05:34:29,740 --> 05:34:39,319
so much smoke

2964
05:34:39,799 --> 05:34:46,380
Left are we smoking? Hold on. I have to repair this

2965
05:34:48,119 --> 05:34:57,520
Uh boat dealt with I can't get back on the gunner's seat

2966
05:35:02,590 --> 05:35:05,869
The sharks are gonna eat me the sharks are gonna eat me go back

2967
05:35:10,110 --> 05:35:12,110
Don't kill me don't kill me

2968
05:35:13,799 --> 05:35:15,799
Okay, holy shit

2969
05:35:15,799 --> 05:35:18,840
Wait, wait, wait slow down slow down. I need to I need to sit down

2970
05:35:20,700 --> 05:35:22,700
You good? Okay. I'm good

2971
05:35:23,099 --> 05:35:25,099
I just road killed a shark

2972
05:35:26,349 --> 05:35:30,029
And we got the meat for it. He's definitely in that big tower over there

2973
05:35:30,750 --> 05:35:40,169
Okay, so

2974
05:35:40,169 --> 05:35:42,169
Uh, once we get in here

2975
05:35:42,250 --> 05:35:45,680
Because they're like the highest level enemies in the entire game

2976
05:35:46,720 --> 05:35:50,639
If they don't one shot us, we're just gonna no fighting like only run

2977
05:35:50,880 --> 05:35:53,919
Yeah, just just try to get where just try to get what we're trying to get to

2978
05:35:55,439 --> 05:36:02,520
That guy's the guy was on our team. How was I supposed to know that? I'm just look every everything's a threat right now

2979
05:36:02,520 --> 05:36:04,520
We're trying to get to the guy the last guy in the game

2980
05:36:08,729 --> 05:36:15,439
Kind of yeah, no, it's just a seawall. Uh

2981
05:36:16,319 --> 05:36:17,919
boat explosion

2982
05:36:17,919 --> 05:36:20,349
Watch out for the buoy watch out for the buoy

2983
05:36:20,750 --> 05:36:22,189
That wasn't mine

2984
05:36:22,189 --> 05:36:24,520
What do you mean abandoned ship?

2985
05:36:24,520 --> 05:36:29,080
Oh, fuck. No, we're okay. Hold on. How do you uh, those are those are mines?

2986
05:36:39,069 --> 05:36:40,919
No

2987
05:36:40,919 --> 05:36:43,080
What happened you ran into a mine?

2988
05:36:43,880 --> 05:36:50,119
Yeah, but like uh, we were stationary. I didn't expect it to explode twice. Where's this gonna put us? Oh, no

2989
05:36:51,279 --> 05:36:59,400
Shit, I I should have I should have jumped. I was trying to get the other boat the people off the other boat

2990
05:36:59,720 --> 05:37:05,340
Okay, what if we get on a plane and we take that same route around that'll be faster, right?

2991
05:37:07,130 --> 05:37:13,080
We need like okay, uh, we need to get a plane that has a gun. I think the game crashed

2992
05:37:14,029 --> 05:37:19,630
Um, I think we're just so far away from anywhere that it wants to spawn us that it's loading in the game again for the first

2993
05:37:19,630 --> 05:37:26,959
Time but also it it may also bug. Yeah, but

2994
05:37:29,959 --> 05:37:37,770
Oh

2995
05:37:37,770 --> 05:37:43,659
I don't what what exploded the second time?

2996
05:37:44,299 --> 05:37:49,979
I don't think it was a mine. I think they like fired an explosive round. I think the boat was on fire

2997
05:37:50,939 --> 05:37:53,500
From the boat my piloting has a grenade launcher

2998
05:37:53,979 --> 05:37:58,220
So if they had one of those like aimed at us, they could just shoot a grenade launcher. Oh, we were so close

2999
05:37:59,950 --> 05:38:05,610
We were so close

3000
05:38:05,610 --> 05:38:09,930
And also it may have crashed. I think we're I think we're dead in the water here

3001
05:38:10,810 --> 05:38:13,020
Yeah

3002
05:38:13,020 --> 05:38:17,229
Yeah, i'll give it till it completes the circle, but that's it

3003
05:38:18,569 --> 05:38:19,930
And we're out

3004
05:38:19,930 --> 05:38:23,400
Oh

3005
05:38:23,400 --> 05:38:25,400
It got disconnected

3006
05:38:27,979 --> 05:38:29,979
Is far cry six good? No

3007
05:38:31,919 --> 05:38:36,110
Is far cry six worth playing? Yes. Hope that answers your question

3008
05:38:40,310 --> 05:38:43,529
15 for the premium edition on you play

3009
05:38:49,119 --> 05:38:51,279
Far cry six playing it like we are right now

3010
05:38:52,159 --> 05:38:54,159
Is a absolute blast

3011
05:38:54,560 --> 05:39:03,240
Does a six out of ten rating still stand? Yeah, it's not a bad game. It's just

3012
05:39:04,040 --> 05:39:06,680
More exactly what you've played probably three or four times now

3013
05:39:09,229 --> 05:39:11,470
Yeah, it's fun. I seem to remember, uh

3014
05:39:12,110 --> 05:39:17,259
I feel like there's maybe more stuff in this game, but there's more like locked stuff

3015
05:39:17,740 --> 05:39:22,889
Far cry five. I remember we streamed it twice because there was like more stuff to do

3016
05:39:24,540 --> 05:39:26,860
Yeah, I mean granted we are we are not

3017
05:39:27,979 --> 05:39:33,979
Playing the game the way that it may have been intended to be played to be clear. I'm at like stream shit

3018
05:39:34,060 --> 05:39:37,340
Yeah, yeah

3019
05:39:37,340 --> 05:39:42,319
All right. Do you want to try the plane strategy once see if it works? Yeah. Um, um, it's up to you

3020
05:39:42,639 --> 05:39:57,389
Yeah, let's let's try playing strat one time worth a shot. I'm loading back in here. It's definitely fun

3021
05:39:58,959 --> 05:40:00,959
Like not every game that comes out has to be

3022
05:40:01,439 --> 05:40:04,000
like a masterpiece

3023
05:40:04,939 --> 05:40:09,340
It's just fun to play. It's not I mean, it's just good. I guess kind of

3024
05:40:11,770 --> 05:40:14,880
Really pretty looking game seems to be well acted

3025
05:40:16,159 --> 05:40:19,840
But you kind of it would just we you're just playing the same game

3026
05:40:19,840 --> 05:40:26,720
You've already played just kind of more stuff to do since but since like far cry four, right?

3027
05:40:27,200 --> 05:40:33,549
It's sort of every far cry has been like a dlc for far cry four. Is that accurate? Yeah, pretty much

3028
05:40:37,790 --> 05:40:41,069
There's only so much new stuff you can add once you've got like yeah

3029
05:40:41,930 --> 05:40:43,930
helicopters planes

3030
05:40:44,029 --> 05:40:52,840
Uh jet skis boats with guns on them boats with the grenade launchers on them. You got a black screen. Yeah, it's it's loading

3031
05:40:54,540 --> 05:41:06,319
What is this warm up pso cash thing? I've never seen that before all right

3032
05:41:06,319 --> 05:41:20,409
We're gonna play try to plane strat see what happens. What was the one you you play? Uh, what far cry primal?

3033
05:41:21,930 --> 05:41:26,569
yeah, that was like the um, uh, that was that was the

3034
05:41:27,680 --> 05:41:33,000
One with the dinosaurs and the mammoths. I wonder if that one's fun. I never played it

3035
05:41:33,819 --> 05:41:43,470
All right. I'm ready for an invite. Okay. I'm currently connecting to the far cry servers

3036
05:41:44,270 --> 05:41:49,310
Please wait

3037
05:41:49,310 --> 05:41:51,869
How do you feel about sorb being in smash? What are your thoughts?

3038
05:41:53,759 --> 05:41:55,919
Uh, what are my thoughts on sora being in smash?

3039
05:41:59,790 --> 05:42:01,799
well

3040
05:42:01,799 --> 05:42:04,919
Where to begin first I need to go ahead and show you guys the prologue

3041
05:42:05,000 --> 05:42:07,000
This is the lore for kingdom hearts one

3042
05:42:07,319 --> 05:42:12,840
And i'm trying to figure out how to canonically connect the sora in smash brothers with the other 17 kingdom hearts games

3043
05:42:13,080 --> 05:42:16,200
So if you guys would all just uh, go ahead and sit down get a snack pay attention

3044
05:42:16,200 --> 05:42:20,360
We're gonna watch all the lore videos for all the kingdom hearts games back to back in order to understand

3045
05:42:21,000 --> 05:42:27,639
Why sakurai decided to do this and go ahead and extend the kingdom hearts lore into the smash universe thereby

3046
05:42:28,430 --> 05:42:33,849
Putting every single smash character potentially in the next kingdom hearts game you say can I have an invite?

3047
05:42:35,500 --> 05:42:43,439
Yeah, I already sent you one. Let's see. What the heck that was pretty good. Uh explainer

3048
05:42:43,680 --> 05:42:49,040
It says I don't have one from you. It said I don't have a I don't have one. I sent another one

3049
05:42:49,520 --> 05:42:56,159
got it, um,

3050
05:42:56,159 --> 05:42:58,319
one of the things that I heard or that I was looking at is that

3051
05:42:59,200 --> 05:43:03,419
Sora has been they wanted to put him in the game like a year or two ago, right?

3052
05:43:03,819 --> 05:43:04,779
but like

3053
05:43:04,779 --> 05:43:10,540
It took like three years of like lawyers all yelling at each other before they finally agreed to put him in the game or something

3054
05:43:11,099 --> 05:43:14,330
Because I was confused. Okay, if you're gonna have banjo kazooie

3055
05:43:14,650 --> 05:43:17,130
Don't you think you want banjo kazooie to be to be the last character?

3056
05:43:18,200 --> 05:43:22,119
And then so why wouldn't sora have come out during when kingdom hearts three was relevant?

3057
05:43:22,119 --> 05:43:24,759
you want to know the real reason the real reason is because

3058
05:43:25,319 --> 05:43:27,549
Uh, coincidentally

3059
05:43:27,549 --> 05:43:32,990
Sora is announced for smash at the same time that the kingdom hearts games are announced to be coming to nintendo platforms

3060
05:43:33,869 --> 05:43:37,290
And there it is. He's got it. There it is. You got you found the smoke and gun

3061
05:43:39,290 --> 05:43:42,889
It's just a brand deal like nintendo doesn't give a shit to the last character

3062
05:43:42,970 --> 05:43:46,650
They were just like what major uh franchise can we bring to switch because people are complaining

3063
05:43:46,650 --> 05:43:49,290
There's not enough third party games on our platform and they're just they're just playing

3064
05:43:49,450 --> 05:43:53,130
Uh pokemon snap for like 30 minutes and then putting the switch down like I don't understand

3065
05:43:53,450 --> 05:43:54,009
There it is

3066
05:43:54,009 --> 05:43:58,409
He's got to get some long ass games that will take 150 hours for gamers to complete and sell it in a big bundle

3067
05:43:58,409 --> 05:44:02,409
So they can buy the bundle and I guess we'll get a new character and smash at the same time. There it is

3068
05:44:03,450 --> 05:44:09,709
Nailing it there it is. Um

3069
05:44:10,560 --> 05:44:12,560
Okay, let's go to the plane joke

3070
05:44:12,959 --> 05:44:30,860
Where is the plane joke from here?

3071
05:44:30,939 --> 05:44:36,200
Uh, I was looking for the oh they're looking for the craft image. There it is. There it is

3072
05:44:36,919 --> 05:44:38,200
Okay, I got an idea

3073
05:44:38,200 --> 05:44:43,819
What if we both take a plane that way if one of us crashes the other one's alive? That's that's brilliant

3074
05:44:44,380 --> 05:44:48,439
I wonder if we can summon two at once which i'll say i'll have to say close

3075
05:44:48,599 --> 05:44:52,520
So you don't like yeah, because i'm gonna port into yours and then my plane's gonna explode

3076
05:44:53,000 --> 05:44:55,319
Okay, so you just drive like a few feet down the runway

3077
05:44:58,700 --> 05:45:01,069
Yeah, you go first

3078
05:45:01,069 --> 05:45:04,590
I'm just gonna be honest. I i need to follow you not the other way around

3079
05:45:05,849 --> 05:45:11,229
Trust me on this one. Okay. I'm just gonna set like a marker a helicopter is probably better right now

3080
05:45:11,229 --> 05:45:18,590
But plane but it's slow. It is slow. You're right. Okay, what happens if you call for two planes?

3081
05:45:21,659 --> 05:45:25,180
Just says ride cannot be delivered. Let's see if we can even spawn two planes in

3082
05:45:25,979 --> 05:45:31,259
Well, how about this you just go i'll try to spawn one. It's gonna teleport me into your plane anyways

3083
05:45:31,900 --> 05:45:40,509
So that should be fine

3084
05:45:40,509 --> 05:45:47,580
Vehicle currently in use so no just go so just me just you are you in if you fly?

3085
05:45:47,580 --> 05:45:54,240
I'll just be teleported to the backseat

3086
05:45:54,560 --> 05:45:58,799
Why are things exploding on the side you ran over? Oh, I got 15 trees. Oh what?

3087
05:45:59,840 --> 05:46:01,840
I got you with that. No, I didn't

3088
05:46:02,159 --> 05:46:08,119
I did not hit you with that. Did I no way

3089
05:46:12,459 --> 05:46:22,080
What the fuck I can't believe that hit you. Okay. Um, just fly away fly to are you

3090
05:46:23,279 --> 05:46:33,680
In or not? No, not yet. I'm just I can still see you now. I'm in okay

3091
05:46:34,240 --> 05:46:40,169
So theoretically here if you go to the ocean, maybe the right should we go fly to the ocean?

3092
05:46:41,849 --> 05:46:47,040
If you fly straight ahead from here, just fly straight. Oh, hang on. Oh wait

3093
05:46:47,040 --> 05:46:50,400
I'm looking at the wrong person here. Yeah, you gotta turn around fly towards the ocean

3094
05:46:51,180 --> 05:46:57,470
You will not hit any other room here. We're about to be in some very heavily restricted airspace

3095
05:46:57,470 --> 05:47:10,159
I'm gonna fly with this mountain. There are places where we can fly. It's just the entire zone that he's in we cannot you like your

3096
05:47:11,500 --> 05:47:14,750
Oh flying north

3097
05:47:14,750 --> 05:47:16,799
Are we upside down?

3098
05:47:16,799 --> 05:47:19,200
Uh to try to get out of restricted airspace

3099
05:47:23,479 --> 05:47:28,520
I am okay. I need to go west or what which direction I need to go. So you need to go north

3100
05:47:29,919 --> 05:47:33,310
fly north and

3101
05:47:33,389 --> 05:47:37,799
North is the restricted airspace though, is it I don't know

3102
05:47:37,799 --> 05:47:42,360
Okay, both of our curses are on top of each other and I can't tell who's pointing who

3103
05:47:42,840 --> 05:47:47,000
Okay, no turn right turn right if you pull right and just kind of i'm already committed

3104
05:47:47,400 --> 05:47:51,849
What are you talking about? You're already committed. I'm already in what are you doing? No, don't be in

3105
05:47:52,569 --> 05:47:54,569
What are you doing? Don't be in

3106
05:47:57,869 --> 05:48:06,360
We're going down just pressed e

3107
05:48:10,590 --> 05:48:26,029
What just hit you i'm still alive. All right, it didn't work. Whatever. They're you sniping at me?

3108
05:48:26,669 --> 05:48:33,790
Different man for himself now

3109
05:48:33,790 --> 05:48:35,790
I keep pushing this button

3110
05:48:35,950 --> 05:48:44,599
Okay, look, it's fine. We actually are

3111
05:48:45,479 --> 05:48:48,360
Almost halfway there. No, we're we get where I

3112
05:48:52,159 --> 05:48:59,450
We're almost halfway there. Hold on. I got an idea. This helicopter is just chasing me

3113
05:49:00,090 --> 05:49:04,700
It's okay. You're gonna come to me. I'm trying to come to you without being killed

3114
05:49:05,900 --> 05:49:07,900
The helicopter i'm coming

3115
05:49:08,540 --> 05:49:10,619
You will

3116
05:49:10,619 --> 05:49:13,819
Spawn me into your car. Okay, i'm coming

3117
05:49:16,240 --> 05:49:20,159
I don't think are you just gonna try to just drive there on the road a gta strat

3118
05:49:20,240 --> 05:49:22,799
We're gonna go to uh, we're gonna go to the airfield

3119
05:49:23,599 --> 05:49:25,599
And then steal a vehicle from the airfield

3120
05:49:32,220 --> 05:49:34,220
It's where it is right there

3121
05:49:35,560 --> 05:49:39,159
I told you we're not we're really not that far. Oh, we're really not

3122
05:49:41,549 --> 05:49:43,549
Like god, I hope I just throw a grenade in his room

3123
05:49:44,830 --> 05:49:46,830
Oh that didn't work out

3124
05:49:54,750 --> 05:49:59,740
Gotta go around the spikes

3125
05:49:59,900 --> 05:50:01,020
All right

3126
05:50:01,020 --> 05:50:05,340
We're in rank seven

3127
05:50:05,340 --> 05:50:09,180
Why do we have people behind us? Hey, it's all right. What rank are we we're gonna get like triple experience

3128
05:50:09,900 --> 05:50:14,810
Oh double xp weekend and far cry six pretty much what we're doing

3129
05:50:16,759 --> 05:50:19,479
Right click on italics his head then left click. Oh, I wonder what that does

3130
05:50:20,200 --> 05:50:30,880
Okay before we dive do you actually is there a plane available?

3131
05:50:31,520 --> 05:50:33,520
In this the senate

3132
05:50:33,520 --> 05:50:37,979
Um, I didn't mean to shoot. I don't know. That's very good question. You just alerted every

3133
05:50:38,700 --> 05:50:40,700
I alerted the pig zona

3134
05:50:40,779 --> 05:50:42,779
Oh

3135
05:50:48,970 --> 05:50:51,930
I mean if there's going to be a plane there it's this one right there

3136
05:50:52,959 --> 05:50:54,799
There is in fact a plane here

3137
05:50:54,799 --> 05:51:00,720
straight ahead

3138
05:51:00,720 --> 05:51:16,009
Move. Oh guard. Hang on. I can take him out. Let's go. This one has a machine gun on it. Why wasn't he dying?

3139
05:51:23,279 --> 05:51:25,279
Oh, there is a machine gun on this one

3140
05:51:26,650 --> 05:51:31,770
Okay, yup, you be I mean I did crash the last plane so I can't really talk. Hey, fly plane quick. Tell me

3141
05:51:32,490 --> 05:51:34,490
How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly?

3142
05:51:35,290 --> 05:51:37,290
How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? How do you fly? Okay

3143
05:51:37,290 --> 05:51:43,919
We have nothing else. Just head to the ocean ocean fast

3144
05:51:44,959 --> 05:51:52,950
We're about to get

3145
05:51:53,229 --> 05:51:56,119
No, sorry get a boat get a boat get a boat get a boat

3146
05:51:58,400 --> 05:52:03,959
I'm still alive. You are I'm alive. I have one HP. Okay. Wait say hello. I'm gonna spawn on you in a second

3147
05:52:03,959 --> 05:52:09,169
I'm on you. All right, we need a boat. It's right there, dude

3148
05:52:09,770 --> 05:52:17,090
We have to overwhelm the fuck out of somebody over here boat. Oh, we gotta go to the same boat

3149
05:52:17,130 --> 05:52:24,970
We have to overwhelm whoever's on it because they're gonna be people with machine guns and stuff on fire. I think so

3150
05:52:26,209 --> 05:52:28,450
God oh

3151
05:52:29,250 --> 05:52:38,009
Shit they get to the boat really hard. I will take I'm just bait right now

3152
05:52:38,529 --> 05:52:45,669
I have two of them three of them on me right there's more. I can't heal in here. Just stay alive

3153
05:52:45,669 --> 05:52:50,889
I'm gonna try to bait all of them. Okay. I'm gonna get to this boat. I just got killed. They're on you

3154
05:52:50,930 --> 05:53:01,040
I made it to the fiery boat. Excellent currently repairing excellent. Oh excellent

3155
05:53:04,939 --> 05:53:06,939
No dinner today, huh

3156
05:53:11,779 --> 05:53:25,700
Okay, okay repaired I'm gonna drive we gotta go guy in the water I think there is fuck him look here's

3157
05:53:26,220 --> 05:53:30,319
All right

3158
05:53:30,319 --> 05:53:34,400
Perfect. This is exactly where we were last time. We just have to get over here

3159
05:53:35,360 --> 05:53:37,360
Can you stop for a sec so I can get in the gunner?

3160
05:53:37,520 --> 05:53:51,180
All right, you go. All right. There are mines here. We have to be aware of going for that building over there here

3161
05:53:51,340 --> 05:53:53,340
Did they don't want us out here?

3162
05:53:53,900 --> 05:53:58,740
So I'm thinking once I get in here, I'm gonna take a right

3163
05:53:59,299 --> 05:54:10,400
Let's see. We could we could like you should be able to see him. They're like

3164
05:54:11,040 --> 05:54:13,889
Floating in the water. So should I bang?

3165
05:54:13,889 --> 05:54:17,689
Should I go right just bang it right here and just we'll go in there or should I wrap around further?

3166
05:54:17,689 --> 05:54:21,209
Cuz I feel like it's right there. That's his like big hideout or something, right? Yeah

3167
05:54:21,209 --> 05:54:24,610
Like we exploded just in front of his head towards the seawall to the right

3168
05:54:25,250 --> 05:54:30,240
All right. I see the mines. Oh, there you go. Yeah, the big big red bubbles

3169
05:54:30,840 --> 05:54:35,049
Can I shoot him? I?

3170
05:54:35,049 --> 05:54:37,090
Would you're alerting people to our presence?

3171
05:54:37,689 --> 05:54:40,569
Okay, so if we get up here

3172
05:54:40,770 --> 05:54:44,029
See this spot right here

3173
05:54:44,270 --> 05:54:57,330
Right where the wall is clear in a path. The question is do I get how far in is this place?

3174
05:54:59,029 --> 05:55:01,029
From where we are right now

3175
05:55:01,189 --> 05:55:04,720
Should we jump over here and just kind of start a sneak into the house

3176
05:55:05,080 --> 05:55:08,020
We're gonna have to go through the whole city

3177
05:55:08,099 --> 05:55:11,849
What about is there a better place of me extremely restrictive you have to fly into it

3178
05:55:11,849 --> 05:55:14,529
You'll be shot down to die immediately, but we're not flying it

3179
05:55:15,049 --> 05:55:18,810
What are we going for this building? Like I would say the big one. Yeah

3180
05:55:19,330 --> 05:55:21,950
Like the one with the red the red light at the top

3181
05:55:21,950 --> 05:55:31,689
Yeah, I feel like that's a big isn't that the hotel or is that his like actual hideout? Well, he's got we got

3182
05:55:33,099 --> 05:55:34,180
square

3183
05:55:34,180 --> 05:55:39,290
Park or a del Leon

3184
05:55:39,729 --> 05:55:49,220
Where the where the spoilers in chat? Well, we have to get out of here. Anyways, so let's just get out

3185
05:55:50,330 --> 05:55:56,189
We can't take the boat over here. It's a mansion

3186
05:55:56,630 --> 05:56:08,110
Okay, this is probably the good time to like actually change to usable guns poor daily own is the hideout. So we need to go

3187
05:56:08,669 --> 05:56:24,029
There was that okay, we have toro did alone dating on the law. Yeah, whatever. It's marked. We have to be very careful

3188
05:56:24,430 --> 05:56:48,889
Okay, I'm just changing load out. There's a car right here. Looks like there's nobody around that is that

3189
05:56:49,770 --> 05:56:53,189
Is that gonna be should we put all our eggs?

3190
05:56:53,189 --> 05:56:59,819
I feel like we should do not split out to be in this. Yeah, like not split up but like he separated

3191
05:56:59,819 --> 05:57:01,819
I said the respawn points are too valuable

3192
05:57:02,419 --> 05:57:11,270
Well, I'm gonna slowly just kind of start moving around void this all the all the red gas shit. That's the enemy side

3193
05:57:11,709 --> 05:57:17,979
Yeah, there's a lot of Emmys down there. Honestly, I would just get in the car for now because there's no enemies down

3194
05:57:18,580 --> 05:57:26,250
Almost away from their suspicion. There we go. Okay. Yeah, I would just get in the car right now

3195
05:57:26,290 --> 05:57:32,159
Until we find a new car is in the event that you could you get detected? I we can just get out of here

3196
05:57:32,520 --> 05:57:44,770
All right, let's do it. I'm just avoiding all the red circles dead ahead

3197
05:57:49,139 --> 05:57:51,139
And the houses too

3198
05:57:52,810 --> 05:57:55,970
Why does this feel like dying light? Oh wait for the car to pass

3199
05:58:04,610 --> 05:58:08,090
Just like running over shit, okay, this is we can go this way now

3200
05:58:08,650 --> 05:58:18,540
It's a roadblock up ahead. There is but there's nobody here. I think they're in the guard tower. Oh fuck

3201
05:58:19,099 --> 05:58:26,580
Are we gonna get through this? Uh, I think it's very purpose-built to not allow this

3202
05:58:26,580 --> 05:58:28,580
I think we're gonna have to go on foot to be honest

3203
05:58:28,979 --> 05:58:36,380
All right, let's sneak just put this holster your gun. Maybe it'll buy us more time. Yeah, go for stealth stab kills

3204
05:58:36,900 --> 05:58:44,619
Where are you going?

3205
05:58:47,290 --> 05:58:49,290
Restricted areas

3206
05:58:50,250 --> 05:58:52,889
Blue marker, no, no the the white one

3207
05:58:53,770 --> 05:58:58,830
Make it again

3208
05:58:58,830 --> 05:59:05,250
Yeah, the one I'm looking at is this one here or Deleon is where he is. Oh, it's blue for me. Okay

3209
05:59:05,669 --> 05:59:13,900
What is that as a stork? I feed the stork. I

3210
05:59:17,939 --> 05:59:19,939
Thought the stork made that noise

3211
05:59:21,580 --> 05:59:24,580
It's like the period just ended in like a hockey game

3212
05:59:29,479 --> 05:59:34,650
Pelican. All right, let's go this way. Hang on. Hang on

3213
05:59:34,889 --> 05:59:38,770
We have a silenced gun, but it probably does no damage to like level eight

3214
05:59:38,930 --> 05:59:42,090
No, the only I would only gonna be able to stealth kill these guys

3215
05:59:42,849 --> 05:59:51,020
It says one there's a guy scary guy there. No, that's a dog

3216
05:59:51,540 --> 06:00:02,939
It's a dog and a scary guy about this way an idea. That's a slow take it easy

3217
06:00:03,459 --> 06:00:05,580
We're not in a rush

3218
06:00:05,580 --> 06:00:18,409
Yeah, we if we are literally dead on site now

3219
06:00:18,709 --> 06:00:24,959
This is actually this gameplay right here is is kind of what Deathloop is sort of

3220
06:00:26,459 --> 06:00:28,380
Oh

3221
06:00:28,380 --> 06:00:30,380
Alright

3222
06:00:30,540 --> 06:00:35,770
Nobody's here. Are we good? Can we yeah. Yeah, we're good. Does it hurt? Oh

3223
06:00:40,459 --> 06:00:56,229
There's a crafting table here, I think those are good guys on the right are they a new fast travel open location. Oh

3224
06:00:57,880 --> 06:01:04,520
Dude, oh dude. There's no way the dude is here. Oh, he's here. Oh, he wasn't my voice to hear that

3225
06:01:04,520 --> 06:01:17,049
I want to be able to shoot him in the head once and kill him

3226
06:01:20,689 --> 06:01:27,419
That's definitely not gonna happen. I want sir slightly reduced

3227
06:01:28,060 --> 06:01:30,400
weapon noise

3228
06:01:30,400 --> 06:01:41,389
No, that's it. That's getting rid of no. No, I don't want range. I don't want to do that. Maybe I do

3229
06:01:44,099 --> 06:01:52,299
Optical socket. Okay, I want I haven't unlocked any others armor piercing. I've got a I've got a decent weapon with a silencer now

3230
06:01:52,299 --> 06:02:13,209
I do armor piercing without no I can't it's locked item missing. All right, what are the weapons? Can we do here?

3231
06:02:13,529 --> 06:02:21,840
Sniper I mean there's also the theory that mean if we can just run on his front door and just hold the fucking fire

3232
06:02:21,840 --> 06:02:24,840
Dang down. They just don't just wm1 pyro his house

I'm gonna put flamethrower on I'm gonna put this new

3236
06:02:46,790 --> 06:02:52,689
How do you unlock new utility like throwables cuz there's like grenades and stuff that's a great question

3237
06:02:53,209 --> 06:03:12,220
Okay, I've got level three Captain America shield what you're seeing is democracy

3241
06:03:28,490 --> 06:03:33,560
Okay, they're they're on this road

3242
06:03:34,159 --> 06:03:39,220
His voice is getting louder

3243
06:03:39,540 --> 06:03:42,490
He's on the mic right now. Yes

3244
06:03:43,229 --> 06:03:49,150
Okay, what about if we go down this alley this way over here?

3245
06:03:52,860 --> 06:03:58,020
What is the charm a meal a succulent Chinese meal

3246
06:04:00,979 --> 06:04:11,279
Ta-ta and farewell you can use the grapple to on

3247
06:04:11,840 --> 06:04:16,560
Is there is there a grapple point? I mean it probably is. Oh, there is a grapple point

3248
06:04:17,119 --> 06:04:20,340
Can't see it from here

3249
06:04:20,340 --> 06:04:22,220
Damn it. I keep thinking that

3250
06:04:22,220 --> 06:04:25,860
Like they've seen us. Yeah, that's like a you've been spotted

3251
06:04:26,020 --> 06:04:39,599
Why why be careful be careful be careful why oh, it's to the grapple from below, okay?

3252
06:04:42,080 --> 06:04:48,169
It's fine, there's nobody down here. All right, well, there's like a perfectly cut scream clip possibly

3253
06:04:52,409 --> 06:04:56,669
Right, there's the child there's people to the left here

3254
06:04:57,950 --> 06:05:04,419
I'm thinking down this yeah down this alleyway

06:05:08,099 --> 06:05:10,099
What happened what happened to you all right?

3256
06:05:15,880 --> 06:05:27,639
All right, we're gonna make it through here. I thought there was a guy's head and closer all right easy

3257
06:05:30,500 --> 06:05:33,380
The dog over here. This is a dog. This is dog. What do we do?

3258
06:05:34,540 --> 06:05:44,279
Where do we go this way? Oh shit? Oh wait. We just got so laying people out

3259
06:05:44,279 --> 06:05:49,459
I think I think we that's probably a better way to go though. Don't you think?

3260
06:05:49,459 --> 06:05:51,459
That person is an RPG

3261
06:05:53,659 --> 06:06:00,770
Which can run to his house run to his house they do have an RPG

3262

06:06:32,360 --> 06:06:45,409
Alright, I'm gonna avoid them and my heel back. I don't think they could possibly know where I am

3268
06:06:45,409 --> 06:06:53,549
I wonder can I get the rocket launcher from that guy if I kill him? I wonder if I can get him

Shit, we're getting close man. Uh

We are getting close what's gonna happen when we get there, I don't know

3279
06:08:20,709 --> 06:08:22,709
I'm gonna run over the flame throw and hold it down

3280
06:08:23,189 --> 06:08:38,310
As long as look just me and you are the last people there's two other people that are left in pub G

06:08:38,310 --> 06:08:45,450
It's you and me just play like your life depends on it. Okay, they're across the street someone someone's over there that can see us

06:08:45,930 --> 06:08:47,930
Okay, let me I can I snipe them

3283
06:08:48,450 --> 06:08:51,130
Very important playing pub GPC or mobile

3284
06:08:52,849 --> 06:08:54,970
Yeah, there's a guy right there I think I can get him

3285
06:08:57,610 --> 06:09:01,319
Dead roof. I shot him in the head

3286
06:09:01,720 --> 06:09:15,130
Keep it. Um, there's a lot of people on this street. All right, just left for dead time left left for dead

3287
06:09:15,930 --> 06:09:36,209
Bathroom until they leave us long. This guy just ziplined. I guess not. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck

3288
06:09:36,569 --> 06:09:48,779
Why not hitting this guy?

3289
06:09:48,979 --> 06:10:00,430
I'm gonna stealth kill the mortar guy

3290
06:10:03,979 --> 06:10:11,229
Wow, I can't help you I have zero health this one guy down here

3291
06:10:12,889 --> 06:10:19,610
All right, you just stay alive because I have zero HP. Okay, I'm healing. I don't know who can see me

3292
06:10:20,150 --> 06:10:28,849
Somebody can see me. All right. I got I got my health back my heel back. See if I can pop this guy

3293
06:10:28,849 --> 06:10:32,729
I have no bullets in this gun. What am I? What the hell are you doing? Jeremy? Oh

3294
06:10:36,189 --> 06:10:38,189
Shit, we need ammo

3295
06:10:38,569 --> 06:10:44,709
He's focusing on you

3296
06:10:46,750 --> 06:10:53,540
I'm alive down here. If you need to die, go for it. All right. All right. I'm gonna come and cover. I'm sorry doggy

3297
06:10:53,939 --> 06:11:05,950
I'm sorry. I have to get ammo. I guess I'm like a pistol ammo. You should give me a break

3298
06:11:06,509 --> 06:11:17,909
Hey, I think we have to run. This is totally walled off over here. Is this

3299
06:11:18,669 --> 06:11:21,680
Shit, what about down this way? Oh

3300
06:11:24,259 --> 06:11:37,470
I'm down that hurt. I'm just gonna die so I can spawn on top with you. Okay, just stay in a safe place

3301
06:11:37,470 --> 06:11:52,750
I feel pretty safe here. I gotta switch weapons about to spawn on you in like 10 seconds

3302
06:11:53,029 --> 06:12:05,430
Okay rank up to stand up to stronger soldiers. That's fine. I'm coming on you. Here we are

3303
06:12:05,430 --> 06:12:11,869
I need to change weapons. Don't stand up by the way, if you stand on the guy

3304
06:12:12,630 --> 06:12:18,919
To the north he made they may have seen but I don't know if they can get up here

3305
06:12:23,020 --> 06:12:26,080
Somebody can see us when we stand. Yeah

3306
06:12:26,599 --> 06:12:37,310
That 352 this way. All right, we just gonna keep going this way. Yeah, but that that way's a super wall

3307
06:12:37,310 --> 06:12:42,529
Is it super walls completely? What if we go to the light might be able to parachute over it? You think so?

3308
06:12:43,169 --> 06:12:45,049
Like getting on top of this

3309
06:12:45,049 --> 06:12:49,409
There's a bad place for yeah, we definitely gonna get over there from here on the roof. We gotta move

3310
06:12:49,409 --> 06:12:51,049
We gotta move. We gotta move. Gotta move

3311
06:12:51,049 --> 06:12:58,709
Fuck the parachute didn't go off. Don't jump. Don't don't wait. What do we both die?

3312
06:13:00,349 --> 06:13:09,880
It wasn't high enough to deploy the parachute. Oh, come on

3313
06:13:16,229 --> 06:13:21,709
That was a classic fall joke. Oh, all right now that we got a fast travel point though, didn't we?

3314
06:13:21,709 --> 06:13:22,990
Let's see if it works

3315
06:13:22,990 --> 06:13:38,009
It it yeah, apparently I can't believe we both didn't get the parachutes up

3316
06:13:38,009 --> 06:13:44,450
I think it was just too hot too high, but too low too high to live too low to parachute

3317
06:13:46,049 --> 06:13:54,700
All right, let's go I didn't even see Teresa the entire time somebody said you might be able to wing suit

3318
06:13:55,340 --> 06:13:59,939
We have to go to like a real well, I might be able to and then pull you pull you in

3319
06:13:59,939 --> 06:14:02,180
Yeah, dude, what if we just okay, hold on hear me out here

3320
06:14:02,779 --> 06:14:06,639
Let's go all the way up to the top of this building and then you just wing suit and fly over there

3321
06:14:06,959 --> 06:14:13,099
Everybody sees us here

3322
06:14:16,830 --> 06:14:30,729
Okay, I can't hurt these guys at all. We need armor piercing bolts. Oh shit. Oh, I have soft ammo on

3323
06:14:36,220 --> 06:14:50,680
Soft ammo I need the other gun, but I can't I don't have time to switch to it. Oh, that was you shit

3324
06:14:51,279 --> 06:14:55,580
That was me. I can't even

3325
06:14:57,259 --> 06:14:59,259
Know

3326
06:15:00,540 --> 06:15:02,540
Bird motherfucker, how dare you

3327
06:15:04,060 --> 06:15:07,009
Oh

3328
06:15:14,090 --> 06:15:28,459
Okay, I need let me do hold on let me change my ammo dude if it is a bench this thing sucks

3329
06:15:28,779 --> 06:15:34,860
Me like give me this thing and I won't change the ammo on it

3330
06:15:37,610 --> 06:15:44,319
Armor piercings on it. That's good. I gotta put armor piercing on this thing, too

3331
06:15:44,799 --> 06:15:56,770
It's no ammo on this thing. I think you unlock more at the workbench. Is that you?

3332
06:15:57,569 --> 06:16:06,759
What this is I'm at the workbench. Oh, there we go. There's a guy. Okay, just put armor piercing on every gun

3333
06:16:07,119 --> 06:16:17,639
Yeah, you don't have to be the workman's you can do it anyway. Yeah, you can do it anywhere. Okay

3334
06:16:18,240 --> 06:16:35,599
One mod available to install it workbench. Oh, come on. Okay. Here we go. You put armor piercing on your flamethrower

3335
06:16:36,319 --> 06:16:37,599
I

3336
06:16:37,599 --> 06:16:41,520
Can't switch it out. I don't think I have it. Yeah, you have to be at a workbench

3337
06:16:45,369 --> 06:16:46,569
Oh

3338
06:16:46,569 --> 06:16:48,569
What the fuck why?

3339
06:16:48,810 --> 06:16:51,310
All right. So hey look

3340
06:16:51,709 --> 06:16:58,900
See that grapple point over there. We need to get on top of this building. That's high enough for you to wingsuit across the town

3341
06:16:59,419 --> 06:17:04,409
Uh-huh, but you can't die though. Like is there a way can you safely land the wingsuit somehow?

3342
06:17:05,290 --> 06:17:07,090
parachute

3343
06:17:07,090 --> 06:17:21,400
We have to get we have to get higher. Yeah, we actually do need to get higher. Hold on. I got an idea

3344
06:17:21,799 --> 06:17:34,360
There's a workbench right there. Yeah, I know it's too late though. Are you gonna try to like worms?

3345
06:17:35,080 --> 06:17:37,080
Ninja rope up to another platform

3346
06:17:37,759 --> 06:17:44,869
Yeah, but I can't I can't like any more anymore slack. You're gonna hit the wall

3347
06:17:46,369 --> 06:17:53,990
Slow it down. I see you're gonna try to go up here

3348
06:17:57,599 --> 06:18:01,540
You actually might be able to do this if you can grab on top of where that moss is

3349
06:18:01,979 --> 06:18:10,319
This is difficult and it's not going anywhere

3350
06:18:11,000 --> 06:18:12,799
Any more space

3351
06:18:12,799 --> 06:18:29,099
Okay, except this person throwing grenades up here. We got to get across to it. Let's go across three

3352
06:18:29,700 --> 06:18:40,340
Okay, you first tell us you don't have parachutes. That's why that's what's going on. We don't have parachutes. It's grayed out

3353
06:18:40,700 --> 06:18:45,740
It's not that we're not deploying them fast enough where it's too low or too high. We don't have them

3354
06:18:46,299 --> 06:19:03,869
Maybe I don't have a wingsuit either. Okay, so there's another tall building. Yep that we can climb

3355
06:19:04,470 --> 06:19:12,529
You you lead you're the one that has the suit. Hopefully you still have it. Do I have the suit?

3356
06:19:13,330 --> 06:19:20,159
Find out. Oh

3357
06:19:20,159 --> 06:19:22,240
Back turn around. No

3358
06:19:22,240 --> 06:19:23,590
Add

3359
06:19:23,590 --> 06:19:25,590
Wait, are you alive? Yeah. Oh, yeah

3360
06:19:25,590 --> 06:19:34,060
Who's this then except my dog all the way back there? I think so

3361
06:19:34,740 --> 06:19:40,479
Yeah, there's like there's like four or five guards on the street. Okay

3362
06:19:45,990 --> 06:19:55,509
Hmm. All right. I see. Yep. We gotta take these guys out

3363
06:19:56,430 --> 06:19:59,880
All right, you stay up there then

3364
06:20:00,279 --> 06:20:13,590
That guy's got a lot of armor. Do you think a human body can block a rocket behind you behind you behind you behind you?

3365
06:20:14,150 --> 06:20:19,250
Why are you behind you behind you? I'm trying to shoot him. I'm

3366
06:20:21,689 --> 06:20:23,689
Okay, is that it I

3367
06:20:27,119 --> 06:20:29,639
Think that's it on this street helicopter coming in

3368
06:20:33,099 --> 06:20:38,349
Chopper is here. Oh

3369
06:20:38,470 --> 06:20:46,720
We got impacts wax. I feel like this is probably good. There's like high-level gear. Where are you over here?

3370
06:20:47,080 --> 06:20:48,000
in the building

3371
06:20:48,000 --> 06:21:09,060
Helicopters here now tension coming this way. Yeah, there is. All right. What if we go? I'm really sorry. I'm sorry

3372
06:21:09,060 --> 06:21:11,060
We have we need clear road

3373
06:21:13,569 --> 06:21:15,830
Does the chopper know where we are? I don't know

3374
06:21:16,569 --> 06:21:23,799
Probably. Okay, so I'm just gonna go for this alley dead ahead. Um, is this person on the ladder? Oh

3375
06:21:24,319 --> 06:21:28,729
It's not that person off the ladder

3376
06:21:36,909 --> 06:21:47,479
They're freaking out down there. All right, we have to move. Oh shit. Yeah, we're gonna move. Where are we going from here?

3377
06:21:49,959 --> 06:21:54,900
I need to get to the top of a really tall building to see if I can ring suit

3378
06:21:55,340 --> 06:22:17,729
There's too many fucking people there. This is the street from last time. Is that a friendly dog? Oh, thank God

3379
06:22:18,209 --> 06:22:20,450
Okay, so we know how this ends

3380
06:22:20,729 --> 06:22:27,069
The chopper is just chasing me, but I'm behind you

3381
06:22:27,590 --> 06:22:33,860
He the chopper is gonna be overhead in a second. It's here. Oh

3382
06:22:40,349 --> 06:22:52,060
What happened that hurt?

3383
06:22:52,380 --> 06:22:58,860
Sucks, what about that alley straight ahead to your right? Oh

3384
06:23:00,599 --> 06:23:02,599
Fuck bad. Very bad

3385
06:23:03,360 --> 06:23:19,560
Hiding I'm just hiding that somehow. I am technically still alive. I'm gonna reload guns

3386
06:23:20,080 --> 06:23:32,360
Who sees me who sees me who sees me who sees me who sees me?

3387
06:23:39,919 --> 06:23:45,659
Just hang over there I'll hang over here. I can't hang over. I can't hang over there anymore. I got an idea

3388
06:23:46,180 --> 06:23:51,659
I'm almost I'm out of ammo for a lot of whips. Oh

3389
06:23:54,020 --> 06:23:56,200
This is bad. Okay. I'm gonna go for something here

3390
06:24:02,060 --> 06:24:22,549
Okay, fixing my broken ow, I kind of went around to the right side

3391
06:24:22,549 --> 06:24:24,470
I'm gonna see if there's anything over here we can do

3392
06:24:24,470 --> 06:24:27,740
Have they sounded the alarm already? I

3393
06:24:28,380 --> 06:24:32,139
Think so like on the roof

3394
06:24:32,779 --> 06:24:41,159
Damn it. They really don't want you to go over there. Yeah

3395
06:24:41,759 --> 06:24:52,439
Like e1 is super off-limits manhole manhole. There's a manhole

3396
06:24:52,880 --> 06:25:02,340
Where is it dude come to me? Holy shit. This is the way in

3397
06:25:04,349 --> 06:25:11,979
Actually the way in where are you? I would just throw yourself off a building. I have no idea how I got here

3398
06:25:12,220 --> 06:25:15,939
There is no wingsuit. Yeah, no wingsuit

3399
06:25:16,459 --> 06:25:36,799
Not permitted at this location. All right, I'm dead. So don't die. It's gonna hide. I gotta switch guns to these armor

3400
06:25:38,139 --> 06:25:50,700
25% damn it. What does he like the metal gear solid death sound?

3401
06:25:51,060 --> 06:25:55,430
I'm here. Okay, take a look at this

3402
06:25:57,380 --> 06:25:59,810
interesting, huh, oh

3403
06:26:00,169 --> 06:26:02,369
God don't do what I did. Don't do what I did. Don't do what I did

3404
06:26:03,409 --> 06:26:17,130
Nice and slow. Oh, we got flash game flashlights and everything. Isn't this the tutorial sewer?

3405
06:26:17,970 --> 06:26:19,130
Yeah

3406
06:26:19,130 --> 06:26:22,790
There are alligators down here. You're gonna turn into one

3407
06:26:23,310 --> 06:26:30,130
They've hostile. Let's not find out

3408
06:26:33,369 --> 06:26:47,400
Are we gonna like a pop-up in his bathroom like in his toilet? There's a I mean at that

3409
06:26:47,740 --> 06:26:54,770
We could but we would just be copying. All right. I'm not gonna go out yet because George are Martin

3410
06:26:54,930 --> 06:26:59,529
You might put your head out and die. Is it safe? There's a tank out here. Okay

3411
06:26:59,529 --> 06:27:02,369
There's a hang on if we stay safe crouched completely hidden

3412
06:27:02,849 --> 06:27:08,130
There's a chance we might if they're not in the tank already. We might be able to get the tank. Oh

3413
06:27:08,770 --> 06:27:15,099
Bro, okay. That sounds like a great idea ready. I don't have a silencer

3414
06:27:15,099 --> 06:27:18,860
There's a guy right to your left right to your left literally right next to us. You'll see that

3415
06:27:19,419 --> 06:27:21,990
Okay, I'm taking a shot. What about the guy right here?

3416
06:27:27,500 --> 06:27:30,830
Take care of the alarm. I will shoot the alarm

3417
06:27:33,369 --> 06:27:34,819
Did you get it?

3418
06:27:34,819 --> 06:27:39,900
No, he got it. Oh, yes. Oh, no, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do

3419
06:27:39,900 --> 06:27:42,139
I don't know what to do. I'm freezing in panic. I'm gonna go this way

3420
06:27:42,740 --> 06:27:46,540
I'm gonna go. I don't know what to do. Where do I go? I'm gonna go this way. I think I'm running over here. Oh

3421
06:27:49,299 --> 06:27:56,040
Just run just run just run just run run run run run back in the sewer. Hey, can you get back?

3422
06:27:56,740 --> 06:27:58,740
Oh

3423
06:28:00,580 --> 06:28:04,490
He went into the tank

3424
06:28:04,889 --> 06:28:08,569
Yeah, like he okay. It's like his animation started

3425
06:28:09,330 --> 06:28:12,290
Or I could like shoot him to get out of it. Damn it. Oh

3426
06:28:18,080 --> 06:28:21,919
He wouldn't he just started speeding I freaked I don't know where to go

3427
06:28:21,919 --> 06:28:25,400
I didn't know if I was gonna run into a bunch of enemies. All right, last try one more try. Let's go for it

3428
06:28:25,400 --> 06:28:30,279
Hey last try. Let's try. Let's try going different route. I'm gonna put armor piercing on every single weapon you have

3429
06:28:34,169 --> 06:28:46,240
Let's try taking a different path. I don't know that for sure that if I was allowed to take the tank

3430
06:28:46,240 --> 06:28:51,659
I there was no prompt. Yeah, can you how do you craft ammo? Can you craft ammo?

3431
06:28:52,799 --> 06:28:55,419
some guns you

3432
06:28:55,540 --> 06:29:01,150
Pick like primary weapon, whatever then the gun. It should be the first attachment mod

3433
06:29:01,150 --> 06:29:08,599
I really don't have enough to do armor piercing for um, it's annoying

3434
06:29:08,880 --> 06:29:19,740
You have to EMP a tank to steal it. You actually can have an EMP really to disable vehicles

3435
06:29:19,979 --> 06:29:26,060
But I don't know how to get it now you up you change your backpack. Oh, they're here. What do you mean?

3436
06:29:26,060 --> 06:29:36,310
They're here stun grenade smoke grenades

3437
06:29:36,990 --> 06:29:45,099
Dynamite I don't have we don't have EMPs. I don't think there's a perception grenade. I don't know what that is

3438
06:29:48,000 --> 06:29:56,740
EMP sticky EMP grenade blast grenade EMP acquire Supremo from Juan's office or his arms dealers

3439
06:29:56,740 --> 06:30:07,680
We have to do it first. Yeah. Well, um, go right in the sewers this time. It'll lead you to the compound

3440
06:30:08,000 --> 06:30:15,080
Okay, good. No, no armor piercing. I can't come on

3441
06:30:15,080 --> 06:30:21,700
There's uh, if you if you look at your pack your Supremo pack. Hmm, and then mods

3442
06:30:22,099 --> 06:30:28,560
There's one for like minor armor piercing protection and there's also one for just run faster

3443
06:30:30,319 --> 06:30:35,819
Sharp sure to kill streak poison powered

3444
06:30:36,360 --> 06:30:49,619
Nobody what that's actually a really good idea. Dude. What are we thinking? This person's brilliant. I want that person to be

3445
06:30:50,580 --> 06:30:53,119
I'm going to time them up for 10 seconds. Just let people know who it was

3446
06:30:54,889 --> 06:30:57,889
Somebody said that I should just hide in the sewer and be your spawn point

3447
06:30:58,009 --> 06:31:06,830
Well, you just try to get into the compound good. That's a great idea

3448
06:31:07,549 --> 06:31:18,009
Okay. All right. You ready? Hold on

3449
06:31:20,259 --> 06:31:21,939
classic halo stretch

3450
06:31:21,939 --> 06:31:28,029
Dude, halo one. That's what you do to play halo on legendary

3451
06:31:28,970 --> 06:31:43,889
Somebody is the spawn we grapple this we're gonna get back to that sewer. All right back to that sewer

3452
06:31:43,889 --> 06:31:49,569
I don't remember where it was. It's that eyeball on the map. Holy shit. They've all

3453
06:31:50,090 --> 06:31:53,549
They were all just about to collapse on us

3454
06:31:55,439 --> 06:31:57,779
Luckily, I put armor piercing rounds on my

3455
06:31:58,400 --> 06:32:03,610
Well, that saves us some time rifle here

3456
06:32:11,259 --> 06:32:13,770
Okay, good

3457
06:32:13,770 --> 06:32:22,119
You know six hours to beat halo one on legendary. How do every good joke is plus five, dude, how the fuck did we?

3458
06:32:22,119 --> 06:32:32,299
Oh right here. Um

3459
06:32:32,779 --> 06:32:41,150
Follow the eyes. Nobody remembers a plus five minus five

3460
06:32:41,709 --> 06:32:54,939
What happened? What happened you good? I broke my arm. Are you going this way? By the way? I don't know

3461
06:32:55,159 --> 06:33:06,130
We need to get to that. Um that eyeball the eyeball

3462
06:33:06,810 --> 06:33:08,349
eyeball on the map

3463
06:33:08,349 --> 06:33:12,959
Where are these guys coming from?

3464
06:33:13,319 --> 06:33:22,959
Are they shooting the dog? I don't know

3465
06:33:26,099 --> 06:33:28,099
chorizo's getting them

3466
06:33:28,139 --> 06:33:35,709
really

3467
06:33:35,709 --> 06:33:44,479
Well, this is clearing them out. This is good. Yeah, but don't they just respond do they?

3468
06:33:45,119 --> 06:33:53,360
All right, we got to get this way. Okay, chorizo

06:33:57,080 --> 06:34:03,200
Where's guapo I don't know what happened to guapo I think I gotta go heal chorizo

3470
06:34:11,520 --> 06:34:13,520
I didn't do it long enough. I didn't do it long enough

3471
06:34:24,479 --> 06:34:29,709
Wait, here's guapo. What is the whole time?

3472
06:34:30,310 --> 06:34:36,000
All right, let's go. I don't know where you were going before but you went in a full circle and we're just killing people

3473
06:34:36,040 --> 06:34:40,639
I do I don't I don't know how I got to that eye see the eyeball on the map the mini map

3474
06:34:40,639 --> 06:34:42,639
That's where the sewer is. That's where we need to go

3475
06:34:42,639 --> 06:34:45,880
But it like I think we have to go this way see the blue marker

3476
06:34:45,880 --> 06:34:47,880
Oh, actually, I think we can go down here to take a right

3477
06:34:48,479 --> 06:34:51,099
See the little blue map down here

3478
06:34:52,979 --> 06:34:58,680
I hate that I hate that I hate that I just had to do that

3479
06:35:09,000 --> 06:35:22,310
Yeah, this is the right way now we go through here, huh, and then we go

3480
06:35:23,229 --> 06:35:32,669
This way this way. Oh my god that guy fucking exploded. Oh

3481
06:35:35,590 --> 06:35:40,919

He's dead, okay, okay gamer moments now we need the sewer

Which where the fuck is it?

3484
06:36:06,909 --> 06:36:08,720
Shit

3485
06:36:08,720 --> 06:36:10,720
It's definitely okay. I think it was this way

3486
06:36:12,159 --> 06:36:16,959
Ignore these guys and then it was to the right. Actually, I don't know I teleported to you

3487
06:36:16,959 --> 06:36:22,549
No, this is the wrong way. Hold on. We need to go. This is where I went before I died

3488
06:36:22,549 --> 06:36:27,799
Yeah, I don't have no idea straight and then right straight and right right there straight and right

3489
06:36:27,799 --> 06:36:44,360
I think it actually could be this way. Just walk through this like checkpoint thing. Uh-huh. Holy shit

3490
06:36:45,000 --> 06:36:55,529
Yep, bingo. Don't three though

3491

Whisk woppo. All right. There you go. All right. So now I said in the sewer go right

3492
06:37:11,580 --> 06:37:13,580

Oh god, oh don't die. What the fuck one are you dead? Nope almost though

Are you petting him if you die right now, I'm going to die you understand

3496
06:37:44,479 --> 06:37:49,049
Did you stop to pet chorizo while they want they while they were coming around the corner?

3497
06:37:49,450 --> 06:38:01,229
Yes, I could have just gone in the sewer. I it's too much pressure fighting people like 10 levels higher than us

3498
06:38:01,869 --> 06:38:06,139
Guys, I have the same gear I got from the tutorial

3499
06:38:06,619 --> 06:38:16,159
All right, we get there in five seconds if we don't go on a loop, all right, let's go go go go go go I

3500
06:38:16,680 --> 06:38:28,119
Was I was curious to see if you had invincibility frames if you pet one of the animals because it would have been huge

3501
06:38:28,439 --> 06:38:32,619
All right, where did you go down? Yeah

3502
06:38:33,139 --> 06:38:56,349

3503
06:38:57,069 --> 06:38:59,880
That was a great throw. Oh

3504
06:39:00,799 --> 06:39:02,240
Fuck be careful

3505
06:39:02,240 --> 06:39:06,849
Yeah, we should just wait to get in the sewer all we all that matters is the sir

3506
06:39:07,250 --> 06:39:15,970
Just exactly where we just were. Okay, you fucking stupid ass game

3507
06:39:15,970 --> 06:39:28,159
I don't know how I seeing all this and you're not seeing any of it. I'm just trying to stay alive, man

3508
06:39:28,159 --> 06:39:30,159
I don't know. I'm just trying to live

3509
06:39:30,500 --> 06:39:32,500
They're doing some insane shit

3510
06:39:46,080 --> 06:39:54,380
Here right behind. All right, let's go. I

3511
06:40:00,439 --> 06:40:04,099
Died like six times. Okay hard, right?

3512
06:40:04,720 --> 06:40:07,529
Watch out that guy's got a bomb

3513
06:40:10,560 --> 06:40:17,759
Did somebody set us up where you going just come here. Where are you going? This guy's a rocket launcher turn around. He's fine

3514
06:40:18,560 --> 06:40:23,669
I'm just trying to be like erratic. So he doesn't shoot. He doesn't kill us. All right, they're coming through the checkpoint though

3515
06:40:24,409 --> 06:40:41,419
Dammit, where are they shooting us from both? I don't I'm dead. I'm done. I have no idea who was shooting me

3516
06:40:41,419 --> 06:40:45,650
I think it's up top. He's up top. Okay, let's just go through it. We're gonna go I

3517
06:40:46,290 --> 06:40:49,680
Got shield. I'll lead the way

3518
06:40:50,159 --> 06:40:57,470
I'm so glad you think I'm so glad you're in front John wick

3519
06:40:58,069 --> 06:41:02,349
Here's a rocket launcher. This guy's got a rocket launcher. Did the edible kicked in like fucking ten minutes ago?

3520
06:41:02,349 --> 06:41:14,360
And I am like so glad you're in front of me. Oh, no, you're on fire. Don't spread it over me

3521
06:41:15,389 --> 06:41:19,590
All right. I'm just going to the fucking sewer to be your spawn point for the love of God

3522
06:41:22,470 --> 06:41:31,270
All right, we're good because I'm about to die he's got a flamethrower I just fine I'm in the I'm your spawn point I'm here

06:41:31,830 --> 06:41:40,360
I just you he's just chasing you

3524
06:41:45,720 --> 06:41:57,279
Oh you change guns if you just die it will be fine there's just so much fire I can't kill one guy

3525
06:41:58,180 --> 06:42:00,180
Hopefully he kills you your time to shine

3526
06:42:00,819 --> 06:42:08,180
Everybody's coming down here, right? Why does he look like he's why does it? He looks like he's coming to get me

3527
06:42:08,360 --> 06:42:17,479
He's thinking about it. Why do I hear bullets being shot? Oh, just guapo. I got

3528
06:42:18,680 --> 06:42:20,540
Okay

3529
06:42:20,540 --> 06:42:24,779
We're good. Somebody said go right in the sewer and it gets to the compound

3530
06:42:24,779 --> 06:42:28,599
I was like 80 meters away from whatever the objective was

3531
06:42:29,439 --> 06:42:30,520
Really?

3532
06:42:30,520 --> 06:42:32,759
But I may have set the objective marker way too close

3533
06:42:34,159 --> 06:42:37,880
There you are, okay

3534
06:42:43,080 --> 06:42:45,599
I'm running out of ammo, but I'm here. Yeah me too

3535
06:42:46,119 --> 06:42:48,360
Res go

3536
06:42:48,639 --> 06:42:53,990
Okay, I'm not gonna use in the sewer not gonna res guapo, sorry

3537
06:42:57,080 --> 06:43:06,639
Good very good. Well done. I would not go up there. I

3538
06:43:08,729 --> 06:43:10,729
This person alive

3539
06:43:15,840 --> 06:43:17,479
They're dead now

3540
06:43:17,479 --> 06:43:24,389
Okay, guapos back combat's over. Actually is it okay? Are you gonna go?

3541
06:43:24,389 --> 06:43:29,540
We get a clean clean slate. Are you just gonna check and see if you can just walk into the compound?

3542
06:43:29,659 --> 06:43:32,099
I'm just gonna go back. Remember that we ran to the um

3543
06:43:32,779 --> 06:43:37,970
The tank yeah, I feel like that's kind of where we're going right think so

3544
06:43:38,610 --> 06:43:42,439
Wait, did we come from this way or are we going?

3545
06:43:43,119 --> 06:43:45,659
We are going kind of that way

3546
06:44:03,360 --> 06:44:07,259
Hang on are you back there? How'd you go? I'm in the sewer man. I'm not leaving the sewer

3547
06:44:07,840 --> 06:44:10,799
I'm like on the street level

3548
06:44:10,799 --> 06:44:21,040
You're gonna have to catch up to me though, right? I mean should I just go from the city you can go this way

3549
06:44:21,619 --> 06:44:24,959
You can go up to me at least you want to come up to you

3550
06:44:24,959 --> 06:44:28,680
Are you sure you won't I sure I'm gonna cuz we're gonna get we're gonna I could I could just keep going until

3551
06:44:28,680 --> 06:44:31,000
I teleport you I guess that's true. I

3552
06:44:34,060 --> 06:44:35,779
We certain that you'll be able to

3553
06:44:35,779 --> 06:44:41,240
That means people saying stay in the sewer people saying so we're sewer sewer you have to do the sewer sewer is the only

3554
06:44:41,240 --> 06:44:51,279
Way apparently people saying sewer is the only way. Oh, okay. Well, then maybe I'm just going in a circle then

3555
06:44:55,509 --> 06:44:58,669
Or maybe chat just really wants you to stay in a sewer just to see how long you'll do it

3556
06:44:58,709 --> 06:45:08,279
That's fine. You go you got to tank through the sewer stay in the sewer

3557
06:45:17,490 --> 06:45:25,069
What are you doing down here? There's somebody down here. Okay, I'm gonna die so I can respawn on you in the sewer

3558
06:45:25,069 --> 06:45:51,729
Yeah, who killed Guapo? What am I doing down here? He was the protagonist of a different story. You better not die

3559
06:45:51,729 --> 06:45:55,150
Don't do anything stupid. I am standing still. I'm not going anywhere

3560
06:45:55,790 --> 06:46:11,459
Don't get surprised by a crocodile. I won't there's no crocodiles down here. There's a pretty good side character POV

3561
06:46:11,860 --> 06:46:23,650
That's fine. I just want to make sure we are we are alive. Okay, here we go. I'm here

3562
06:46:23,650 --> 06:46:27,779
All right, so people are saying to go straight and then go right

3563
06:46:28,180 --> 06:46:43,930
You say that we got we got bad guys in the rear. I think we can outpace them. They'll go, right?

3564
06:46:43,930 --> 06:46:45,930
So I'm assuming this means right

3565
06:46:46,610 --> 06:46:54,159
How do we die down here the first time?

3566
06:46:56,439 --> 06:46:58,240
Jump or something

3567
06:46:58,240 --> 06:47:00,979
This goes out of the sewer. I'm I'm staying here

3568
06:47:01,580 --> 06:47:08,790
This is a tank again, yeah, this is other way wrong way other way other way apparently it's the other side

3569
06:47:09,310 --> 06:47:20,549
Yeah, we're on I'm on the wrong side here. He said there were people down here, right? Yep. They're right here

3570
06:47:20,830 --> 06:47:38,299
They said hug, right? It's crocodiles here now, too. I guess still shooting me and you were right in front of him

3571
06:47:38,580 --> 06:47:41,380
Yeah, I have a shield. Would you shoot the shield guy?

3572
06:47:41,979 --> 06:47:45,779
so left

3573
06:47:45,779 --> 06:47:48,279
instead of right I

3574
06:47:48,400 --> 06:47:51,000
Guess it's a secret. It's just a secret back here

3575
06:47:51,720 --> 06:47:54,279
It's wrong secret helmet

3576
06:47:54,319 --> 06:48:09,240
We have to go here. We have to get here. Okay. Well, well, I guess we've just go through where the tank is

3577
06:48:09,680 --> 06:48:16,310
Yeah, what the heck? Well, you guys are helping us

3578
06:48:16,889 --> 06:48:25,979
The shotgun is like god-tier powerful the pistol shotgun shield combo

3579
06:48:26,639 --> 06:48:31,770
Okay. Well, we're gonna try watch over the dog this dog right next to you

3580
06:48:32,569 --> 06:48:45,959
And a mean one it is. Yeah, why is he not attacking you? How safe is it if I come up?

3581
06:48:47,919 --> 06:49:04,259
20% he knows they like kind of know I'm here. Yeah, they know I'm here now. Sorry dog. Okay, you

3582
06:49:05,020 --> 06:49:11,209
Walk was down. I'm going for tank. All right, you'd go for tank. Do you want me to help suppressing fire?

3583
06:49:11,930 --> 06:49:17,659
I'm in you're in the tank. I'm in the tank. Oh hell. Yeah. All right

3584
06:49:18,299 --> 06:49:30,560
But they have RPGs and shit. This is gonna be a short-lived adventure. Do you think so?

3585
06:49:34,119 --> 06:49:37,919
Both I don't think you should get in on the mounted turret. That's for sure

3586
06:49:43,740 --> 06:49:50,849
I'm just gonna try moving but we need to go like that way kind of like right. Can we go right from here?

3587
06:49:51,610 --> 06:49:56,729
Can you repair me if you come back down if you come this way? Yeah, I don't want to go too far out

3588
06:49:56,729 --> 06:49:58,729
Hang on. Hang on. I'm just gonna hop out and try to repair

3589
06:49:58,770 --> 06:50:14,380
Where is this person that keeps seeing me? I don't know where they are. You're right there. Okay full help

3590
06:50:15,020 --> 06:50:19,060
Like I just tried to shoot a rocket on me at me. I think he's still looking at me

3591
06:50:19,659 --> 06:50:25,709
Press V. No, I know what V does

3592
06:50:26,950 --> 06:50:35,869
I don't want to do it right now. I don't I can't get in your tank though. You can but then we'll just both die

3593
06:50:35,869 --> 06:50:44,020
That's true. There is there there is a gunner seat though. I don't know who keeps seeing me. There's somebody right across the way

3594
06:50:47,790 --> 06:50:50,220
I don't like I'm on fire

3595
06:50:50,459 --> 06:50:57,340
Alright, what about can we go down that can that road that's right next to you? Can you go down that this really doesn't take that much?

3596
06:50:57,340 --> 06:51:14,580
Oh shit, I shouldn't have gotten out. Did you pop up? Yeah fight or run. What the fuck?

3597
06:51:14,619 --> 06:51:18,560
I think special forces are about to arrive

3598
06:51:21,080 --> 06:51:22,240
Wanted

3599
06:51:22,240 --> 06:51:29,240
We have to move. I'm moving if we go down. Can we go right? Can we go down this way?

3600
06:51:29,959 --> 06:51:35,430
I'm stuck. I wonder this way we can go

3601
06:51:35,990 --> 06:51:45,360
Back in the sewer because this is blocked off. We have to go left

3602
06:51:45,360 --> 06:51:47,799
But we can't we have to go eventually we are we supposed to go that way

3603
06:51:48,319 --> 06:52:06,919
So we're chat. How do they keep getting up like on the roof?

3604
06:52:07,500 --> 06:52:10,979
Alright, there's a space. There's a place we can go down here. It's a little alleyway

3605
06:52:20,939 --> 06:52:37,369
Okay, is there anywhere? I don't think we can go anywhere. I can't this thing doesn't turn like a tank should follow the blue line

3606
06:52:37,369 --> 06:52:42,049
Yeah, I'm trying to see where it even we go. We have to go that way, but

3607
06:52:42,689 --> 06:52:45,330
What if we jumped on your tank to jump over the wall?

3608
06:52:45,889 --> 06:52:49,159
that work

3609
06:52:49,159 --> 06:52:52,099
Watch out. I'm trying to repair you

3610
06:52:52,619 --> 06:53:09,500
Looking good. Oh, why are you going to circle because everything's blocked off

3611
06:53:09,500 --> 06:53:12,099
We're trying to find a place that we can like get over one of the walls

3612
06:53:12,979 --> 06:53:24,290
Somebody behind us. I only see guapo and my poor pup is just lying on the ground riding

3613
06:53:24,810 --> 06:53:27,770
We can't go this way kill my dog

3614
06:53:28,490 --> 06:53:30,659
Like how do we?

3615
06:53:30,819 --> 06:53:40,500
Maybe through here. I can't shoot

3616
06:53:41,020 --> 06:53:51,439
All right, Guapo. Help me out. Is there a grapple?

3617
06:53:52,119 --> 06:54:00,380
It's a grapple up here

3618
06:54:00,380 --> 06:54:01,619
Chirijo

3619
06:54:01,619 --> 06:54:06,819
You know Jeremy, maybe the area isn't available to you actually reach the point in this story

3620
06:54:07,979 --> 06:54:11,930
What is up here? Is that an explosive?

3621
06:54:16,450 --> 06:54:29,290
I guess not. What is it? It's like a beacon on top of this place. Oh shit crackle and pop machine gun

3622
06:54:30,569 --> 06:54:38,240
LMG what happened by machine gun might actually be good here. I just may be very good

3623
06:54:38,979 --> 06:54:40,659
um oh

3624
06:54:40,659 --> 06:54:47,459
This is where we tried to jump over. Hey, can you come to me? Oh, you're really far away

3625
06:54:47,979 --> 06:54:54,099
It's no grapple hook all clear

3626
06:54:54,619 --> 06:55:03,430
Where is it? I have a door stuck situation. You've got a door stuck scenario. Yeah

3627
06:55:03,909 --> 06:55:10,580
Oh, I might actually be stuck here. I feel like I can make it

3628
06:55:11,180 --> 06:55:23,459
Fight or run there now. Yeah, we know that I'm coming back to you. Oh

3629
06:55:23,979 --> 06:55:28,009
You're very far away

3630
06:55:28,009 --> 06:55:31,970
Cuz I'm kind of just going in a circle cuz we don't know how to get into the center cuz I don't know

3631
06:55:31,970 --> 06:55:40,770
I don't think we can get in there's one way. There's still one way. What is it if I can actually okay?

3632
06:55:40,770 --> 06:55:46,970
I wonder if you start wingsuiting from just outside of the city limits if it'll kill your wingsuit when you get in

3633
06:55:49,529 --> 06:55:55,470
Probably you can but this I think the sewer is south of the tower area. Oh

3634
06:55:58,669 --> 06:56:05,389
Dude we've been in the wrong place the whole time we need to wait we need to be like here

3635
06:56:05,830 --> 06:56:17,459
We've been running around in the sewers up here. We need to be down here. Let's see these blue tunnels

3636
06:56:21,540 --> 06:56:22,619
shit

3637
06:56:22,619 --> 06:56:29,659
Yeah, I'm just heading towards the new marker

3638
06:56:38,979 --> 06:56:41,599
Finger so

3639
06:56:42,360 --> 06:56:44,200
How have we

3640
06:56:44,200 --> 06:56:47,200
If you look at the map, we've just been really far northwest

3641
06:56:47,200 --> 06:56:52,840
We we're supposed to be down south of that area to see the blue lines. I think that's the sewers

3642
06:56:53,400 --> 06:56:58,689
We were getting like sewer directions for the wrong sewers

3643
06:56:59,310 --> 06:57:01,889
Yeah

3644
06:57:01,889 --> 06:57:09,040
Whatever. It's okay. I have a car or we'll have a car

3645
06:57:10,040 --> 06:57:13,299

3651
06:57:49,939 --> 06:58:02,360
Almost there. Okay. Oh

3652
06:58:07,000 --> 06:58:21,860
I was this car still here. This thing's insane. By the way, what this car?

3653
06:58:22,459 --> 06:58:24,459
Now the car that I

3654
06:58:24,819 --> 06:58:39,439
Alright get us to that sewer. We gotta find the manhole that's down here. I think this guy knows it

3655
06:58:44,220 --> 06:58:48,500
I'm going to your marker. I know go to that one. That's where we have to go

3656
06:58:49,139 --> 06:58:53,619
He knows we're doing this. Yeah, we should get out

3657
06:58:54,099 --> 06:59:05,819
What is right here? There's a sewer right here. This is the sewer that we need to get it to get into the compound

3658
06:59:06,220 --> 06:59:11,580
This is the secret sewer we got the all clear

3659
06:59:12,180 --> 06:59:31,669
Don't do what I did. That kills you. Be very careful. Good fault joke. All right, so now we have to just go from here

3660
06:59:32,229 --> 06:59:36,680
This sure ways

3661
06:59:36,680 --> 06:59:40,919
We gotta go we gotta go left. Yeah, go left. This will take us through

3662
06:59:41,799 --> 06:59:49,200
Yep, this way. I don't know about this

3663
06:59:49,840 --> 06:59:59,389
Sewer looks awfully similar thing on this. It's just free stuff. Oh, I get it all even if you if I don't pick it up

3664
06:59:59,750 --> 07:00:03,650
Yeah, we're about to be in his compound

3665
07:00:11,729 --> 07:00:16,459
This is the do or die right here. It's either we do it or we don't so

3666
07:00:17,159 --> 07:00:24,970
We're in like another just kind of tell now he did straight ahead that building is his tower

3667
07:00:32,509 --> 07:00:37,630
There any people think these are civilians. Yeah, we just holster. No, we're not supposed to be here

3668
07:00:37,630 --> 07:00:49,569
We're gonna kill on site the sleepy alien people are just standing outside yawning your front door

3669
07:00:49,669 --> 07:00:53,119
This is like it is like in the movie when the bad guy

3670
07:00:54,080 --> 07:00:57,400
Tricks the good guy into thinking it was easy to get to this point

3671
07:00:57,400 --> 07:01:02,979
You know and then like the lights come on and they were expecting them to break in the entire time

3672
07:01:03,139 --> 07:01:33,909
Yeah, I don't can we go in here. This looks totally blocked. Yes. Okay. Okay, we're in. All right

3673
07:01:33,909 --> 07:01:35,909
We're in we're in that guy was

3674
07:01:36,790 --> 07:01:38,790
Extremely surprised. All right

3675
07:01:39,270 --> 07:01:43,470
No panicking. No panicking. We're gonna get through this. We're gonna go up all the way up the stairs

3676
07:01:43,950 --> 07:01:47,729
We need to play this together cover each other

3677
07:01:52,180 --> 07:01:55,889
There's no guards yet, okay

3678
07:01:57,369 --> 07:02:03,209
New shotgun wait, hold on. Let me look let me equip that cover me cover you we got where are you?

3679
07:02:03,209 --> 07:02:10,880
Oh, there you are. We had dogs in coming. I'm getting a shotgun equipped. Okay shotguns equipped

3680
07:02:11,400 --> 07:02:26,220
Nice and easy. Can you go that way? No

3681
07:02:33,639 --> 07:02:37,200
Hopefully there's this anyway to go. Can we not go anyway?

3682
07:02:37,880 --> 07:02:42,500
Cuz I'm looking at the enemy dog that's trying to get us in it. They're just like pathing around. I

3683
07:02:43,020 --> 07:02:45,630
would assume

3684
07:02:45,630 --> 07:02:55,509
He's not open. There's a I see a grapple point, but it's like kind of outside

3685
07:02:56,229 --> 07:02:58,229
We can't go up

3686
07:02:59,270 --> 07:03:02,340
Here somebody's Oh

3687
07:03:04,299 --> 07:03:09,750
Grapple on roof in big room shit

3688
07:03:15,369 --> 07:03:22,819
Hmm like I see that I see that too is that maybe that's outside

3689
07:03:28,439 --> 07:03:32,319
Definitely not available from here. Oh my god

3690
07:03:33,799 --> 07:03:40,009
Come on here

3691
07:03:40,009 --> 07:03:51,580
The grapple looks like it was on this side. It was definitely like inside but also

3692
07:03:52,500 --> 07:03:54,669
Not on the first floor

3693
07:03:54,669 --> 07:03:57,720
Yeah, it's like it's like right there shit

3694
07:04:00,869 --> 07:04:07,490
They've protected it. I don't think we can get in there an impenetrable locked door

3695
07:04:08,209 --> 07:04:19,139
Damnit, we can't get up there. I don't think um

3696
07:04:19,619 --> 07:04:27,880
I don't think you can fly anything here. No, you know, it's probably it's probably like it loads the area. Probably

3697
07:04:28,560 --> 07:04:35,259
It's probably story locked

3698
07:04:38,259 --> 07:04:42,860
Dogs like attacking me while I'm like smoking a cigar. I'm sorry dog, but I'm gonna die

3699
07:04:42,860 --> 07:04:50,770
I don't think there's any other place we can go. Hi. Is there is there a helicopter around here?

3700
07:04:50,770 --> 07:04:57,700
I mean we could look if there is I don't know where it would be

3701
07:04:58,340 --> 07:05:08,009
Wait, that's a good dog. Oh

3702
07:05:09,209 --> 07:05:17,869
I think the dog barking at us and attacking. That's not a good dog

3703
07:05:18,470 --> 07:05:30,500
You can't slight tackle them. They're running into the building. Um, I don't I don't think there's a I don't think I think I think

3704
07:05:30,500 --> 07:05:31,900
We're screwed. I

3705
07:05:31,900 --> 07:05:33,860
Think we're probably screwed too

3706
07:05:33,860 --> 07:05:40,790
Hang out wait for him to leave and go to a restaurant or something

3707
07:05:42,430 --> 07:05:46,389
But I cleared the street

3708
07:05:46,389 --> 07:05:52,720
Use the vent

3709
07:05:52,720 --> 07:05:56,380
German vent German vent German vent. This is an among us thing

3710
07:06:01,060 --> 07:06:04,400
Probably come out and face us

3711
07:06:04,939 --> 07:06:14,529
Alright. Well, that was fun. I don't think we're getting in here. At least we made it in here. We did make it here though

3712
07:06:20,259 --> 07:06:26,099
What I'm getting hit markers someone someone has held up there

3713
07:06:27,580 --> 07:06:29,580
Oh, that was me dying. Oops

3714
07:06:29,979 --> 07:06:33,599
All right. Oh, that's it

3715
07:06:33,599 --> 07:06:41,290
Yeah, I'm just giving it one last look see I would assume that this area changes when you're supposed to come here

3716
07:06:41,750 --> 07:06:56,169
I'm it probably does. Where are you? Oh, you're in that building

3717
07:06:56,630 --> 07:07:00,340
I was just saying if there's a way to like

3718
07:07:00,700 --> 07:07:06,580
Like that it's not it's not really like a jet pack. This thing only has like a little boost

3719
07:07:07,099 --> 07:07:09,409
We would need like a helicopter or plane or something

3720
07:07:28,599 --> 07:07:38,959
Okay, well played. So maybe I could like

3721
07:07:45,889 --> 07:07:59,139
Yeah, it's alright that was fun though, yeah climb up his leg like a kitten

3722
07:08:00,939 --> 07:08:05,970
Hey, so we just find where the helicopter spawns are

3723
07:08:08,500 --> 07:08:15,900
This is a long stream. Um, it's long. I mean look we're having fun

3724
07:08:16,540 --> 07:08:35,209
All right the shotgun. All right turns people to stone help. I'm bleeding here. I'm my body's on fire

3725
07:08:35,970 --> 07:08:40,279
Are you loving in games when the shotgun shoots and it like rips to the right like this?

3726
07:08:41,020 --> 07:08:45,700
Yeah, what's up with that recoil? Oh

3727
07:08:47,569 --> 07:08:49,569
See the recoil on this look at this

3728
07:08:50,209 --> 07:08:59,819
It's a lot. This little pistols really

3729
07:09:00,799 --> 07:09:03,299
Powerful Jesus

3730
07:09:04,580 --> 07:09:06,759
Is your shotgun do that

3731
07:09:09,930 --> 07:09:12,689
Look at decent do you see how the how crazy the recoil is though, right?

3732
07:09:21,650 --> 07:09:31,389
I can barely even like aim it on my screen. It's like this guy sucks. It's uh, the L Ruby. Yeah

3733
07:09:55,560 --> 07:09:57,200
There's fun

3734
07:09:57,200 --> 07:10:02,279
Everybody this was far cry 6. This is italics. Let me shoot this guy. Let me let me get the kill

3735
07:10:03,000 --> 07:10:06,500
That's fun

3736
07:10:06,500 --> 07:10:11,720
If you don't know italics, this is Alex and he screams got a good scream

3737
07:10:13,419 --> 07:10:15,419
Yeah, it was fun

3738
07:10:17,159 --> 07:10:21,240
Make an objective make objectives for yourself. It's fun

3739
07:10:22,479 --> 07:10:24,200
Okay, so hey

3740
07:10:24,200 --> 07:10:31,909
The first part of the movies over we know what we did is we went actually up to the projector room and we

3741
07:10:32,590 --> 07:10:37,049
Fast-forwarded the movie with everyone still in there just being like what the fuck is going on

3742
07:10:37,049 --> 07:10:45,569
Why we fast-forwarding like the end, you know, you might be able to do that for the other guys

3743
07:10:46,909 --> 07:10:53,139
Maybe not, but that'd be pretty cool. All right. I'll talk to you later. Thanks for playing. Yeah

3744
07:10:53,979 --> 07:10:57,180
Somebody said I'll see you next year. Oh

3745
07:10:57,540 --> 07:11:03,240
Interesting you'll see me next year. How about um, are we are we doing the other thing the man of a damn?

3746
07:11:03,520 --> 07:11:08,880

3747
07:11:08,880 --> 07:11:16,639
That's like that's like in two weeks. Oh shit. Look at that. I gotta play man of a damn with it's Alex

3748
07:11:16,639 --> 07:11:18,639
That's how it works. Can't get rid of me that easy

3749
07:11:18,680 --> 07:11:20,279
Thought I wish I could

3750
07:11:20,279 --> 07:11:23,860
Got to try harder

3751
07:11:24,380 --> 07:11:30,669
Yeah, well, we'll see it talks again in a couple weeks or a man of a damn that's not the name of the game

3752
07:11:30,669 --> 07:11:32,669
That's just what the only one I could remember

3753
07:11:35,799 --> 07:11:40,369
All right, I'll tell you soon dude. I don't know if you're still streaming or not

07:11:40,369 --> 07:11:45,490
But if not, no and I'll talk to you soon. I'm done. But thanks for playing. Yeah, it was

3755
07:11:46,009 --> 07:11:50,959
very enjoyable in in of itself just being shitty but also

3756
07:11:51,040 --> 07:11:56,159
You know just having some good laugh out loud moment. Yeah, and look far cry. Look the great out six out of ten

Hello. Hello. Can you hear? Oh, okay. No, we can hear you. All right

3761
07:13:09,819 --> 07:13:13,060
My computer just crashed. I lost the access to my other monitor

3762
07:13:13,659 --> 07:13:17,459
Everything went on to my main screen. Everything was black for like 10 straight seconds. I have no audio

3763
07:13:19,709 --> 07:13:30,340
Say 50 in the chat if you can hear me. I need to know. Okay. All right, good

3764
07:13:30,340 --> 07:13:40,360
That was really weird. I have my left monitor is like dead. I think my graphics card crashed when I exited the game. All right

3765
07:13:41,540 --> 07:13:48,020
Thanks for watching everybody. We'll see you again. Probably some point in the middle of the week. I'm probably gonna stream on

3767
07:14:05,090 --> 07:14:11,500
And you're probably asking what are we gonna play? I you know, I have no idea

3768
07:14:11,500 --> 07:14:18,869
I was thinking about maybe yeah, what are people saying in the chat smite smite smite one place smite smite smite

3769
07:14:18,869 --> 07:14:21,150
I mean, that's a fun one. That's all right

3770
07:14:21,150 --> 07:14:28,779
Oh, I mean a lot of people in the chat are saying it a lot of people are saying it. That's interesting

3771
07:14:28,819 --> 07:14:46,380
Yeah, well, maybe we'll play smite. We said fuck you. Come on. Just relax man. There's no need for that kind of vulgarity

3772
07:14:46,520 --> 07:14:51,180
What about the Nickelodeon all-star bra? Oh that did come out. That's not a bad idea

3773
07:14:51,540 --> 07:14:54,840
We'll figure out something some of the look just keep an eye on the sauce

3774
07:14:54,840 --> 07:14:55,880
I got some stuff to do this week

3775
07:14:56,900 --> 07:14:58,900
You'll get something midweek and then we'll back on the

Take care of yourself. Thanks for the subs as always and I'm gonna reiterate this one more time

3781
07:15:25,040 --> 07:15:27,459
Money on this stream it sees a lot

3782
07:15:28,200 --> 07:15:32,060
Tried to be pretty transparent about how much money this stream takes in

3783
07:15:32,580 --> 07:15:36,970
There's no you don't need to like give this stream a shitload of money. Please don't

3784
07:15:41,630 --> 07:15:46,790
If you give this channel five dollars a month, it's more than enough way more than enough

3785
07:15:47,270 --> 07:15:55,180
It realistically should nobody should really be ever giving this channel more than that amount per month. I

3786
07:15:56,860 --> 07:15:59,340
can't like stop people from doing that but I

3787
07:16:00,750 --> 07:16:04,950
You know, you guys know how much good guy 98

3789
07:16:11,819 --> 07:16:15,900
Just don't want people to think I'm taking all this shit for granted

3790
07:16:16,819 --> 07:16:19,619
Because I'm not I just hope people know that I don't

3791
07:16:20,900 --> 07:16:22,900
Don't think so much as I need to say

3792
07:16:23,259 --> 07:16:26,709
I'm just trying to do trying to do what I'm doing

3793
07:16:28,819 --> 07:16:29,860
