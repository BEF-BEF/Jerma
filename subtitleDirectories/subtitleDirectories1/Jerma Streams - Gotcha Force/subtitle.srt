8
00:01:48,900 --> 00:02:00,819
I've ever bought uh this has it has to be the most expensive game I own and it is an old classic

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:30,409
the 16 000 people that have a copy I've got you for about train simulator no I I I did I do I own

15
00:02:50,419 --> 00:03:08,599

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
mindset but I'm about to get you got you're about to have sushi for the first time

18
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't I don't like that looks weird I don't like that I think I don't think I like that

19
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,159
and you get a spicy tuna in your mouth and all of a sudden now it's your favorite thing in the

20
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:40,789
world what I don't like sushi well then I don't know then yeah I don't know maybe you won't like

21
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:45,689
gotcha force but I do and there are no vetoes allowed tonight because I'm gonna relive my

22
00:03:45,689 --> 00:04:03,509
entire childhood 2003 how old was I uh night 18 19 I was just a baby seven what 17 maybe

23
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:11,879
well let me relive my adolescence how long are you adolescent for a vessel thanks to the five

24
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,629
community subs vessel go ahead and just get this started get this moved over here there you go

25
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:27,540
gotcha force uh this game has atrocious voice acting to a point where I might mute it eventually

26
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:36,939
because it's it's very very very annoying the game where you collect robots and fight them

27
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,300
and this is a rare game and everyone was like holy shit this game's so good this game was so

28
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,939
good that they've remade it they've re-released it for gamecube like recently I think like within

29
00:04:49,939 --> 00:05:04,970
five to ten years I actually like put it back into manufacturing back in 2012 yeah in japan only

30
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,769
now I don't want you to see that because I'm one of the naysayers to see that when

31
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:15,269
how this plays out in 2012 they wow that's fucking hilarious thought you were doing world

32

33
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,240

34
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,379

648
02:26:00,219 --> 02:26:05,260
to make sure that it was going to be down they like they were doing it on purpose like five

649
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:19,079

654
02:27:36,389 --> 02:28:00,040
stocks all right i gotta get the team together how many outstanding how many germa stocks exist

655
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:16,020
in the world five thousand that's just the number of people that are here that's the first number i

656
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:25,739
thought up because i saw that's the first number i looked at holy shit he shoots missiles oh that's

657
02:28:25,739 --> 02:28:33,610
cool all right let's get in by getting close that's a good escape how did what's his movement like

658
02:28:33,610 --> 02:28:42,389
anyway it's not bad what the hell is with that camera angle i'm assuming his melee damage is

659
02:28:42,389 --> 02:29:16,569
better than anything else yes it is it's low though can drop below 400 what well that's just

660
02:29:16,569 --> 02:29:26,860
manipulation though it's not real follow the fucking germa exchange commission on you guys

661
02:29:26,860 --> 02:29:48,500
by the way it's me they're all going to jail jex germa exchange commission missiles are all right

662
02:29:48,500 --> 02:30:00,250
they're kind of boring though i mean i guess if you can spam them like this it works out pretty well

663
02:30:01,209 --> 02:30:30,860
brush teeth quick the joke tracker wait are you guys let me see this shit what's going on here

664
02:30:31,420 --> 02:31:01,260
you guys causing a problem oh you guys know that it was a point when i was thinking about having

665
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:08,500
an extension made for this channel keep the plus two and minus two out of the chat let's talk about

666
02:31:08,500 --> 02:31:23,690
this holy shit i just get destroyed and have it be something you could do but you couldn't just

667
02:31:23,690 --> 02:31:30,090
like spam it i mean it was like it would be like actually like it would be like an indicator

668
02:31:30,809 --> 02:31:36,180
and every once in a while we would just check on and see how it was but the reason why i didn't

669
02:31:36,180 --> 02:31:43,370
do it and this is the reason why i probably won't do it it's because um i don't we make

670
02:31:43,370 --> 02:31:50,090
jokes about like oh minus two and plus two that's like just i don't know if i want to have a like how

671
02:31:51,049 --> 02:31:57,450
bad is your stream today how not funny were you today oh no today was good but this one oh this

672
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:02,329
is a real time indicator this stream is i don't think this this stream sucks i don't think i want

673
02:32:02,329 --> 02:32:08,280
that information i don't think i would want that because then it would just get in my head

674
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,719
and every day would just be like let me check that joke indicator and see

675
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:16,920
well what do we have plus no no i can do better than that i can do better than that and then i

676
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,559
have to start trying to like make jokes as hard as i can and then that's going to make it worse

695
02:36:40,489 --> 02:36:51,659
the nice thing you went the right way and throw the act oh you have to charge it to throw it

696
02:36:52,219 --> 02:37:08,979
how far does it go that's pretty far actually but it stays out his speed is so bad though

697
02:37:15,379 --> 02:37:26,299
melee is good in this game but not really i'll be honest you gotta get in close people can move

698
02:37:26,299 --> 02:37:55,850
around so far i think this guy's too expensive for how kind of shitty he is i mean it's it stays

699
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:59,770
out okay that's good that's the one decent thing is it actually keeps spinning around

700

03:03:51,670 --> 03:04:08,520
this video is the part where the lady goes like this so she goes i guess that was the last image

803

03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:28,100
goes i don't know what's going on i don't know if the video fucks up or something but she goes

805
03:04:28,100 --> 03:04:38,569
like this she she's hold on see me okay you'll be able to see me so there's a point there's a

806
03:04:38,569 --> 03:04:45,319
point in the video the lady goes like this she's stomping stomping stomping and then she goes like

807
03:04:45,319 --> 03:04:57,860
this she goes like it's weird it's like boom boom boom boom boom you'll see she's like point

814
03:06:17,479 --> 03:06:28,540

815
03:06:28,540 --> 03:06:36,149
uh and again i don't have anything being captured and there's just about the subject

816

821
03:07:55,079 --> 03:08:01,639
the nature of like the internet and internet culture is if you if you if you turn into a

822
03:08:01,639 --> 03:08:09,260
meme somehow it's just that's just there and it's just always going to be referenced it's unfortunate

894
03:24:53,079 --> 03:25:14,819
i kind of like this guy though put it in the 20th slot hear him up somebody said they got

895
03:25:14,819 --> 03:25:40,459
chibi robo and they were so happy about it yes when do you unlock mew too soon what do you

896
03:25:40,459 --> 03:25:45,399
guys think would happen to the channel if i decided that i was gonna start from the very beginning

897
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:52,340
as of like as let's just say let's just say as of tomorrow this is a hypothetical not real

898
03:25:52,340 --> 03:26:00,250
scenario just make that clear um if i decided i was gonna start at pokemon red and play every

899
03:26:00,250 --> 03:26:07,290
single pokemon game back to back to back until i got to the new one what would happen that's the

900
03:26:07,290 --> 03:26:15,110
all that literally is the only thing i did on stream until it was over and it took me like three

901
03:26:15,110 --> 03:26:34,200
months to do it please do that no i would never do it it's a fun thought project but what if i

902
03:26:34,200 --> 03:26:43,319
did a stream where i just planted grass and i just streamed the soil every day for like eight hours

903
03:26:43,319 --> 03:26:47,319
until there was grass there and then i and then the end of that stream the end of that whole arc

904
03:26:47,319 --> 03:26:52,440
of like a month is i just a lawnmower comes from off the screen and just runs it all over

905
03:26:52,440 --> 03:27:07,299
and then the stream ends oh what am i doing i'm getting three kills in five seconds what are you

906
03:27:07,299 --> 03:27:31,270
doing is it woody from toy story it is what is this guy this is like a premium woody skin

907
03:27:42,200 --> 03:28:07,379
that move is so good it's unbelievable give me woody give me woody oh that's okay though

908
03:28:07,379 --> 03:28:32,649
that's kind of cool wire gunner speed support not it's not a really bad attack really bad

909
03:28:32,649 --> 03:28:42,920
everything actually would assault punch wire shoot set wire wire gunner is an army member

910
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:56,700
and specialist in trapping enemies in uh that web well have to try everything at least once

911
03:28:57,260 --> 03:29:23,399
that's kind of the rule right sell i think you can discard you can't sell use the me gunner

912
03:29:24,120 --> 03:29:37,559
it is a me gunner yeah versus what nothing nothing on the screen

913
03:29:39,479 --> 03:29:56,969
i like the way that this character looks what is this got plenty of ammo wait a minute you did

914
03:30:00,809 --> 03:30:16,040
what is this am i supposed to be grabbing them oh that's kind of good they touch it they get hurt

915
03:30:21,989 --> 03:30:30,069
it's kind of like it's just a shotgun blast is that what that's doing it's shooting five

916
03:30:30,069 --> 03:30:37,940
ow you guys i think that's not doing great why would you use that when you just do this

917
03:30:38,739 --> 03:31:11,670
why why it's a harpoon oh oh i get it i get it oh okay that's a lot cooler now like so how many

918
03:31:11,670 --> 03:31:25,020
that he's taking a lot of punishment i can't i need like a melee would be great here actually

919
03:31:25,819 --> 03:31:42,600
you can bounce them around wherever you want this is a gimmick character

920
03:31:44,229 --> 03:31:56,809
yeah not yet are we minus two see i'm telling you you guys are just manipulating everything

921
03:31:57,450 --> 03:32:20,819
what happens if i do four and then now i missed whenever you talk it's minus two holy god

922
03:32:25,719 --> 03:32:28,760
that's the kind of comment that makes me want to just take a break and then like throw water in

923
03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:35,239
my face and like smush it around a little bit be like jeremy it's all right get back out there

03:32:36,040 --> 03:32:57,180
from what you're made of hey you're doing great buddy thanks carriage is kind of cool but not

925
03:32:57,180 --> 03:33:09,510

926
03:33:09,510 --> 03:33:27,930
bad i don't that's how yeah we gotta we gotta move some people down here this is too gimmicky

940
03:36:37,719 --> 03:36:45,739
brownies by the way you're curious the chewier the better i like my brownies to be like i could

941
03:36:45,739 --> 03:36:51,959
mistake them for gum they're that chewy to a point where they they bunch up and it's like

942
03:36:55,270 --> 03:36:59,270
and you think if you bite if you pull your teeth up too hard you're gonna rip all your molars up

943
03:36:59,270 --> 03:37:17,540
that's how chewy i want them and you just you put a little bit of milk in your mouth so it makes it

944
03:37:17,540 --> 03:37:25,620
a little softer but still you gotta like i want my jaw to hurt from how hard i have to work to chew

945
03:37:25,620 --> 03:37:56,149
through these fucking things a good strategy here and then go in with a twirl get up there

946
03:38:01,190 --> 03:38:09,219
yet i need characters that can fly you know i'm saying like i mean really fly like that kind of

949
03:39:00,469 --> 03:39:05,510
i used to my mother used to make cookies and i didn't really even know how bad this was

950
03:39:05,510 --> 03:39:12,549
for you until i got a little bit older she would be making cookies and i would just go over there

951
03:39:13,110 --> 03:39:19,510
and just the beater would be there and i would just go in there with like a spoon and eat like

952
03:39:19,510 --> 03:39:23,590
three or four mounds worth of the cookie dough that was in the thing that she was making

953
03:39:26,069 --> 03:39:32,600
and i years later i found out that you know that's it's not good as bad for you it's actually not

954
03:39:32,600 --> 03:39:55,799
great but whatever i'm still alive i guess what is this thing on me raw egg is good as long as

1075
04:09:23,569 --> 04:09:25,940
Give me the death wars unit

1076
04:09:26,020 --> 04:09:30,299
When I get a friend not fair

1077
04:09:30,860 --> 04:09:38,690
Did I remove all the good bots from my team? No, I I like these guys

1078
04:09:42,139 --> 04:09:44,629
actually losing to a kid

1079
04:09:45,149 --> 04:10:17,409
What's wrong with speed girl good? I wish you could use some more HP, but I mean she's solid she's good early game

1080
04:10:17,409 --> 04:10:24,010
Yeah, she's good. She's fine. But we don't have to get all those super rare unlockable like hog champ robots

1081
04:10:24,610 --> 04:10:53,719
Our rare bogus is good enough. I want one of these shield dudes and even get a chance to spawn

1082
04:10:53,760 --> 04:11:11,909
I feel kind of bad for you right in the back. You're the space marine

1083
04:11:12,430 --> 04:11:25,020
Could be what can I do with the first character?

1084
04:11:25,940 --> 04:11:38,110
Probably not he's got a dodge. You got a dodge, right? I didn't I didn't I fucked it up

1085
04:11:38,549 --> 04:12:04,370
And I could activate this but why I bother why is everybody something that ten years old?

1086
04:12:04,370 --> 04:12:06,370
I think they're supposed to be ten years old

1087
04:12:06,610 --> 04:12:17,629
All right, something good something worth putting in the team permanently

1088
04:12:18,229 --> 04:12:39,229
Permanent upgrade. All right, that's a normal night doesn't sound very exciting short range the

1089
04:12:39,909 --> 04:12:43,989
Broad sword cross-shape slash and then shield slash this gotcha board

1090
04:12:44,629 --> 04:12:50,350
His warrior in the night board corpse. He wields a broadsword and his shield repels any attack

1091
04:12:51,069 --> 04:12:59,250
I'll give it a try

1092
04:13:00,129 --> 04:13:13,180
I feel like my characters suck. I have where all the good unlock where all the good

1093
04:13:14,700 --> 04:13:16,700
Rng is giving me bad ones

1094
04:13:18,420 --> 04:13:26,100
Are the tornado? Oh, I will after this. I'm gonna try the shield guy

1095
04:13:27,100 --> 04:13:37,149
After this we're gonna do the losses

1096
04:13:40,040 --> 04:13:53,479
Let's go support

1097
04:13:53,680 --> 04:13:59,700
All right, so they can't hurt me from the front only. All right. Well, I don't have any moves

1098
04:14:00,260 --> 04:14:05,309
But you you can Captain America

1099
04:14:11,329 --> 04:14:20,750
I'm not gonna lie. I don't hate this character. I mean obviously versus enemies that are not on the ground

1100
04:14:21,309 --> 04:14:24,579
You can get a good slash on here and then you block everything from the front of you

1101
04:14:25,219 --> 04:14:26,459
like that

1102
04:14:26,459 --> 04:14:28,459
Yeah, look at this

1103
04:14:28,579 --> 04:14:44,379
Actually kind of good. I wish it wasn't normal night one. Of course, you like the reddit character

1104
04:14:46,020 --> 04:14:48,020
America's a reddit character now

1105
04:14:48,180 --> 04:14:51,559
May that heal heal

1106
04:14:52,000 --> 04:15:04,219
Yes, so what's a not reddit character? I'm sure it's not Deadpool a positive

1107
04:15:04,739 --> 04:15:29,290
There's that hurt anybody oh fuck it does you gotta be really close for it though

1108
04:15:29,809 --> 04:15:39,520
Just keep people in front of you. I'll tell you if I got a better version of this guy. I'm gonna I'm putting him in

1109
04:15:40,200 --> 04:15:52,750
Every superhero is reddit. That's not fair

1110
04:15:53,229 --> 04:15:59,629
No, but Wolverine that Wolverine's probably from reddit. Um

1111
04:16:00,270 --> 04:16:01,950
What about uh?

1112
04:16:01,950 --> 04:16:13,219
So what the hell is a superhero that what super hero my let me actually rephrase this question. What superhero am I allowed to like?

1113
04:16:13,780 --> 04:16:43,860
The Joker I'm allowed to like the Joker. What about um, what red and Stimpy?

1114
04:16:44,379 --> 04:17:01,579
Bane I can like Bane. That's at least that's good

1115
04:17:07,540 --> 04:17:11,979
Reddit Stimpy you guys hate this place

1116
04:17:12,819 --> 04:17:16,680
You guys fucking hate this place

1117
04:17:31,430 --> 04:17:48,500
Have I seen such powerful anger before let's check. Let's test this theory out. Okay, that's actually pretty great

1118
04:17:48,620 --> 04:17:57,270

We're gonna do anything about it. If not that and I'm just not ready

1167
04:25:35,049 --> 04:25:42,860
My ally I don't think was very good either

1168
04:25:43,819 --> 04:25:47,020
This guy's pretty good support

1169
04:25:47,180 --> 04:25:59,899

Get over here. I think this is the last guy right in the back. Do I get something?

1182
04:28:16,569 --> 04:28:36,239
There it is finally the huge long arms and a hundred GF energy

His special random slash move shows unbelievable power

04:29:12,489 --> 04:29:25,989
This guy's fun. I can't even put him on here right now do this and then add

1192
04:29:26,270 --> 04:29:52,579
In Joe right say the game this is like bionicle, uh more so like I

04:29:53,139 --> 04:29:57,239
Don't know what you would you compare this to?

1194
04:29:57,520 --> 04:30:06,879
But just it's the death for his base. Wait, what defeat the Dark Knight?

1195
04:30:07,479 --> 04:30:11,870
Beat the no, I'm already for wait. What about a dragon? There's a dragon here

Gravity trap battle the cosmic dragon. Who should I fight first?

1197

By fight one would like cancel out the other like the dragon. Okay, I'm gonna get man. Oh

1198
04:30:51,659 --> 04:30:55,340
Let us vote. I feel like voting for characters is something we could do tomorrow

1199
04:30:56,020 --> 04:31:22,870
Because I'll have enough to actually make it make sense. This dude's cool. I like it. I is it hitting I think it's hitting I

1200
04:31:23,750 --> 04:31:30,930
kind of

1201
04:31:30,930 --> 04:31:48,260
Yeah, I am hitting him seems a little unfair. It's a downside. It's low. Here it comes

1202
04:31:52,739 --> 04:32:01,190
He turned into the dragon. Oh, that's a cosmic dragon over there. That's for sure. I get a burn this guy

1203
04:32:01,790 --> 04:32:36,290
From that shit. Give me that back. Come here. Give it that way. I throw it into the hole

1204
04:32:37,030 --> 04:32:58,329
Alright, don't attack. It's probably gonna shoot it back at us. It's spice over. Watch this. That's

1205
04:32:59,250 --> 04:33:01,250
That's so ridiculous

1206
04:33:01,370 --> 04:33:04,119
He's so good

1207
04:33:04,159 --> 04:33:20,610
It's so broken. Okay, the team look like no I didn't get anything. Was there a chance I could have gotten something?

1208
04:33:21,049 --> 04:33:35,319
Come on, did I really get our NG didn't get anything? Let's go Dark Knight

1209
04:33:35,520 --> 04:33:39,409
What?

1210
04:33:39,849 --> 04:33:47,159
You play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts

1211
04:33:47,159 --> 04:33:50,520
I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and

1212
04:33:51,279 --> 04:33:53,279
Hold on. I want to read this

1213
04:33:54,400 --> 04:33:57,000
You'd play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts

1214
04:33:57,000 --> 04:34:01,319
I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and blood sprays out and your character can start licking the

1215
04:34:01,319 --> 04:34:06,099
Blood and the blood splatters on the screen is wicked fucking gory and cool. That would be so cool

1216
04:34:07,880 --> 04:34:13,840
Let's go ally

1217
04:34:13,959 --> 04:34:26,689
Mmm, where's another dragon? I

1218
04:34:29,119 --> 04:34:31,659
Just beat you have to fight you over here, too

1219
04:34:32,439 --> 04:34:42,599
Getting close that reason to be far away for any reason

1220
04:34:43,119 --> 04:34:47,279
Plus this guy's gonna go underneath. Oh

1221
04:34:50,119 --> 04:34:54,319
That hurts. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay

1222
04:34:55,080 --> 04:35:03,770
Alright, let's do it. Oh

1223
04:35:04,290 --> 04:35:08,580
You are fucking slow, aren't you?

1224
04:35:08,779 --> 04:35:42,849
No, that was cocky. He's dead. Don't worry. I'll win. He's slow, but he has huge damage

1225
04:35:49,450 --> 04:35:58,880
He's done. Yeah, I don't I'm gonna win music. It's like super monkey ball. You like that. Where'd it go?

1226
04:35:59,520 --> 04:36:01,700
Well, that's not it

1227
04:36:01,700 --> 04:36:04,000
Dragon was just a normal enemy. He had

1228
04:36:04,479 --> 04:36:19,119
way out. Yep long-range

1229
04:36:19,680 --> 04:36:27,009
Still worth it. That means it's gonna be a oh, there's the real enemy. Oh

1230
04:36:32,479 --> 04:36:45,020
This just got bad fuck. I need that

1231
04:36:53,740 --> 04:36:58,590
Hi

1232
04:37:07,389 --> 04:37:09,389
Who's even attacking who?

1233
04:37:09,630 --> 04:37:32,310
Stay back dude. Who is doing that? Where can I get one of these guys? The purple shield guys are fucking insane. I

1234
04:37:45,560 --> 04:37:54,689
Wonder if this guy wait, he might wait what he did it. Yeah. Hey, he doesn't go to stab him

1235
04:37:55,330 --> 04:38:08,840
Nice job. He just had to go up and stab in the neck. I thought the Dark Knight was a roachies partner

1236
04:38:09,400 --> 04:38:27,799
It is some strange data in the gotcha box. That's the data. They stole from me gotcha red band 2.0

1237
04:38:28,040 --> 04:38:38,400
Neo-g-red my true power has returned

1238
04:38:38,840 --> 04:38:43,479
Of the death force has lost their death base things should remain calm for a little while

1239
04:38:44,080 --> 04:38:46,840
But I know that the Galactic Emperor hasn't given up on this planet

1240
04:38:47,479 --> 04:38:49,479
Actually, I fear that the battle has just begun

1241
04:38:49,880 --> 04:38:53,860
We must continue to grow the force so that we will be ready for the Galactic Emperor when the time comes

1242
04:38:54,439 --> 04:38:56,439
Vito I'm counting on you

1243
04:38:56,840 --> 04:38:58,840

04:41:36,319 --> 04:41:58,159
What about the charge? It's better. So it's much better too. Yeah. Oh, it's way better. The sword is a thousand times better

1263
04:41:58,799 --> 04:42:02,840
She's in through under the table

1264
04:42:02,840 --> 04:42:26,639
Okay, that's what I'm gonna call it tonight. We're back tomorrow

1265
04:42:27,279 --> 04:42:30,840
But before we go, I do want to bring up some things that we'll be doing

So we'll see how it happens over the next couple of days. I'm gonna do brownies

Custom robo. I don't I mean custom robo right after this

1272
04:43:13,959 --> 04:43:16,700
Might need a break from robots toys fighting each other

1273
04:43:17,599 --> 04:43:25,849
At some point I want to play I do want to play the GTA online casino update

It's just fun to fight with robots and unlock stuff and keep upgrading it. It's just like a never-ending toy

1279
04:44:00,439 --> 04:44:08,040
Having a lot of fun. It's a great game. So I'll see you tomorrow sticking around. We're gonna do the bits and subs and everything

1280
04:44:08,479 --> 04:44:15,919
We'll see you tomorrow how gotchas work

04:44:33,150 --> 04:44:37,630
It's good to just turn off

1283
04:44:37,790 --> 04:44:43,439
Very good. We'll check back with it tomorrow

1284
04:44:44,400 --> 04:44:49,669
So now we're gonna do the bits from earlier

1286
04:44:53,599 --> 04:45:04,869
Do a rewind here

Thanks a lot. I'll take it sticks renegade. Thanks for the 250 good week so far

1294
04:45:52,740 --> 04:45:58,060
I managed to grab something off an online store. That was hard to get I got a pizza pepperoni with double cheddar cheese

1295
04:45:58,060 --> 04:46:03,799
It's good. I swear you're streaming our state is giving 300% more unemployment money per week

1296
04:46:03,799 --> 04:46:10,240
And I approved the proof for stickers with a stickerola my stickered Toyota Corolla

1297
04:46:11,000 --> 04:46:21,080
Sounds like pretty good week, and I approved the proof for stickers

1298
04:46:21,560 --> 04:46:26,130

1300
04:46:37,279 --> 04:46:43,729
Thank you, German. This is my favorite game from my childhood. We did I think we caught this no no no no no we didn't

1301
04:46:43,770 --> 04:46:45,529
This is just another person's favorite game

1302
04:46:45,529 --> 04:46:51,150
I told you you guys trust me sometimes makes me so happy to see you stream it and give it attention to deserves

1303
04:46:51,349 --> 04:46:57,930
Please save often there is a save data corruption glitch in the game that is prevented by saving often

1304
04:46:57,930 --> 04:47:06,490
I pretty much save after every fight, so I should be alright. Yeah, it's kind of a monk

1305
04:47:06,490 --> 04:47:16,979
I guess I would say I'll keep it up to date. Please remind me. Please remind me

1306
04:47:19,319 --> 04:47:21,319
Transparitas thanks for the

1307
04:47:21,360 --> 04:47:26,680
Five dollars what am I watching? I just want easy bake time easy bake is gonna happen a little bit later than I thought

1308
04:47:32,869 --> 04:47:36,709
It'll be back-to-back with the green screen night. It will be

1309
04:47:37,959 --> 04:47:44,130
15 recipes all of which are varying skill yes

1310
04:47:44,130 --> 04:47:46,130
There is a pizza if you're wondering there is a pizza

1311
04:47:46,610 --> 04:47:55,569
one thing that's gonna be really really important is I gotta check the expiration dates on this shit because I

1312
04:47:56,389 --> 04:47:58,310
can't I

1313
04:47:58,310 --> 04:48:01,029
if I get these packets in the mail and

1314
04:48:02,580 --> 04:48:04,700
They expired in June of like

1315
04:48:05,299 --> 04:48:06,500
2009

1316
04:48:06,500 --> 04:48:17,419
I'm done. I'm not going to eat them. They're all they're all gonna be expired. I don't think so right I'll try

1317
04:48:17,419 --> 04:48:21,220
I'll take a bite of each one, but that gross it's gonna be it's gonna be gross

1318
04:48:21,220 --> 04:48:23,509
I don't think I want to look well

1319
04:48:23,509 --> 04:48:31,840
It'll be a game time decision a curb umble on top of the ten thousand bits and hundred dollars gives another five

1320
04:48:32,119 --> 04:48:37,500
This one last bit drop because I forgot to mention these you look up the vocal version of the game's theme

1321
04:48:37,500 --> 04:48:44,139
We are gotcha force the Japanese vocals were removed from the localization since that's just how things were in 2003 I guess

1322
04:48:48,939 --> 04:48:54,169
vocals

1323
04:48:54,169 --> 04:49:05,540
Let's see. There's not YouTube see

1324
04:49:06,540 --> 04:49:08,720
get this and

1325
04:49:09,159 --> 04:49:10,919
gotcha force

1326
04:49:10,919 --> 04:49:12,759
theme song

1327
04:49:12,759 --> 04:49:15,279
with lyrics or with singing or

1328
04:49:16,680 --> 04:49:50,869
Opening full version gotcha force Japanese opening this one is good, but that's not the one I meant wait what it's not the right one

1329
04:49:51,389 --> 04:49:58,110
This is Bella Lagasse. He's the last to ride, but he's singing the song

1330
04:49:58,709 --> 04:50:40,500
Keep playing it wait, so why why do they take this out is the right one?

1331
04:51:29,610 --> 04:51:39,610
It was gonna be a TV show and that he in a line of toys that didn't sell well, so they didn't do any of it

1332
04:52:07,680 --> 04:52:10,279
Use your clout to bring back gotcha force

1333
04:52:16,060 --> 04:52:18,750
Hey Capcom hey

Twitch live-streaming experiment German nine eight five

1337

I have to bring to you today a request

1338
04:52:35,209 --> 04:52:40,919
There are a lot of us that care deeply about the gotcha force franchise

1339
04:52:42,409 --> 04:52:44,169
animated toys

1340
04:52:44,169 --> 04:52:45,409
figures

1341
04:52:45,409 --> 04:52:52,689

04:53:30,790 --> 04:53:35,270
We're all waiting for it. You know what to do

1347
04:53:35,750 --> 04:53:56,450
German on eight five and the germamites out also one of the thing if you could somehow could bring back Gino

1348
04:53:56,770 --> 04:53:59,459
It's a great character in the Nintendo franchise

1349
04:53:59,979 --> 04:54:05,119
Super Mario RPG. I mean, let's be honest if we're asking for shit

1350
04:54:05,119 --> 04:54:16,259
It'll never happen. I might as well throw some stuff on top. Let it play us out with a song. We are gotcha force

1351
04:54:16,259 --> 04:54:22,520
That's right. We are 31 of us, you know what to do Capcom

1352
04:54:23,040 --> 04:54:26,939
We we love you

1353
04:54:36,220 --> 04:54:52,319
That got really loud all the sudden sing along I don't I can't

1354
04:54:57,119 --> 04:55:10,479
Lyrics all right. I'm gonna turn on the lyrics to learn Japanese. All right. Well, that was fun

1355
04:55:10,479 --> 04:55:14,659
I'm sorry that I just I just don't think you woke up my mom. Oh

1356
04:55:17,119 --> 04:55:19,119
I don't know the petition

1357
04:55:19,479 --> 04:55:21,479
That'll get us to 32

1358
04:55:21,560 --> 04:55:33,889
Every one of these signatures counts man. Come on. That's a cool franchise. It just was you know

1359
04:55:33,889 --> 04:55:40,900
It was kind of I mean, it's not even like the game was dumpy at all. I mean if the game plays very well

1360
04:55:40,900 --> 04:55:42,939
It's a very polished experience the games fun

1361
04:55:43,060 --> 04:55:51,169
I think it's just kind of released at the wrong time. I was not gonna say I was gonna say dumpy

1362
04:55:51,169 --> 04:56:02,139
You're right, but it's not pretty well-made, but thank you curb humble shit Wembley TTV

1363
04:56:02,139 --> 04:56:05,020
Thanks for the 250 this awful voice actor reminds me of Dynasty Warriors 3

1364
04:56:05,020 --> 04:56:12,500
I do miss the time where Japanese video gaming companies would just get anyone who would speak English and act for the lowest price

1365
04:56:12,500 --> 04:56:18,540
I actually think a lot of them are phonetically reading the lines from what I've understood a

1366
04:56:19,799 --> 04:56:24,259
Lot of the Japanese to English voice acting that you hear is phonetic

1367
04:56:24,599 --> 04:56:28,840
They just they don't even know what they're saying. They just are told the way to say it

1368
04:56:28,880 --> 04:56:34,830
So I mean that's that that's pretty incredible if you think about it

1369
04:56:35,349 --> 04:56:46,799
Shenmue 3 did it on purpose

1370
04:56:47,040 --> 04:56:56,639
Really? Thanks of the 250. Hey the Pablo. Thanks for five dollars. Happy four months from the vaude gang. Hello vaude gang

I'm so glad that you were added to the list of people signing the petition

1382
04:58:00,419 --> 04:58:04,479
But I you know, sometimes you have to let a joke die and that's where I'm gonna do that's where I'm gonna kill it

1383
04:58:04,959 --> 04:58:14,240
Thanks for the thousand bits. Welcome

04:58:14,799 --> 04:58:18,880
Castline. Thanks for the three dollars chat hates Jerma having fun Jerma Pluto. I don't think so

1385
04:58:18,880 --> 04:58:23,220
I think I think originally people were like, you know games fucking stupid

1386
04:58:27,880 --> 04:58:33,119
And then they saw the gameplay and then I think I said was gonna happen they saw the collectible robots

1387
04:58:33,119 --> 04:58:49,639
They saw the characters and all of a sudden flipped the other way told you was gonna happen. They left

1388
04:58:49,880 --> 04:58:52,250
That's fine. You stayed

1389
04:58:52,250 --> 04:58:55,319
Hey, you stayed

1390
04:58:55,880 --> 04:59:02,159
So we can we can enjoy the game together if people don't want to watch

1391
04:59:02,439 --> 04:59:08,939
They don't have to and that's fine. They left you stayed and we got to see the fucking voices

1392
04:59:08,939 --> 04:59:12,259
we've got to see the cool gameplay and we got to see the collectibles and

1393
04:59:13,259 --> 04:59:28,139
We got to sign the petition to all of us. But yeah, that's that's all right. Don't matter

1394
04:59:28,459 --> 04:59:32,270
You don't want it. Look if you don't want to watch a stream, you don't like you don't have to

1395
04:59:32,869 --> 04:59:37,619
Not like hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, you left cuz you didn't like the game. No, you know

1396
04:59:37,619 --> 04:59:40,459
I'm sorry, you're you're glued to the seat. You're chained to the seat

1397
04:59:40,459 --> 04:59:46,240
I don't know what you were doing this afternoon, but it's this

1398
04:59:46,759 --> 04:59:51,599

That's unfortunate. I'm sorry here that thanks to the five dollars though. Oh, there's a great company

1425
05:02:41,650 --> 05:02:46,060
It's a whole system. Hold on. It's

1426
05:02:46,979 --> 05:03:02,729
This person if I was talking about drinking on the job to what wouldn't this person on thin ice?

1427
05:03:03,409 --> 05:03:26,060
Yeah, they were this is false lore

1428
05:03:26,779 --> 05:03:32,779
well, anyways

1429
05:03:33,020 --> 05:03:48,619
Thanks, Jerma lied about the turkey joke I did that has actually happened those either don't know what that is

1430
05:03:48,619 --> 05:03:51,840
I was supposed to have I supposed to get footage of

1431
05:03:52,479 --> 05:04:01,400
Me or somebody in a big turkey mask walking by my window in my old place in Massachusetts and I bought the mask

1432
05:04:02,040 --> 05:04:08,540
But before I moved to Vegas, I didn't do it and I didn't bring the turkey mask to Vegas

1433
05:04:08,900 --> 05:04:22,020
So it didn't happen. It was gonna be in video. I don't even know that. How do you know that?

1434
05:04:22,380 --> 05:04:27,709
I don't have I don't think I've ever publicly talked about how the turkey joke did I or

1435
05:04:28,310 --> 05:04:33,869
As you think of something else and did I just did you just do the to take you did the detective thing?

1436
05:04:34,270 --> 05:04:38,150
But you were talking about something else completely and I just admit it to all the crimes

1437
05:04:39,029 --> 05:04:46,790
Hey snoozing copter. Thanks for the 250

1438
05:04:46,790 --> 05:04:51,630
You just said you're looking for a game that plays like this and there actually is one but it's only on the 3ds

1439
05:04:52,029 --> 05:04:58,090
It's the kid Icarus uprising multiplayer mode. Really people actually still play it online

1440
05:04:58,729 --> 05:05:03,689
One of the most underrated games it's so good everyone in chat that played it back me up here

1441
05:05:03,970 --> 05:05:10,099
There's a ton of weapon and item variety. It was directed by Masahiro Sakurai himself

1442
05:05:10,900 --> 05:05:14,459
Unfortunately, you can't stream it, but you still enjoy it on your own. It's definitely worth it

1443
05:05:15,060 --> 05:05:17,939
So good. It's so good. So good. Oh

1444
05:05:18,340 --> 05:05:23,439
My god, yes kid Icarus uprising of this shit. It's pretty good

1445
05:05:25,650 --> 05:05:28,979
Get Gino in here

1446
05:05:29,900 --> 05:05:43,099
Get him in here. I would play it I would try it

1447
05:05:46,099 --> 05:05:50,459
I didn't I didn't play any kid Icarus games ever. So give me a nice

1448
05:05:51,860 --> 05:05:55,380
Dunking my toes in the water for that franchise. So maybe I would give it a try

1449
05:05:55,860 --> 05:05:58,939
Hey video games McGee. Thanks for the thousand bits

1450
05:05:58,939 --> 05:06:02,900
Am I the only one who thinks you look and sound like someone who would play JFK in a scary movie spinoff?

1451
05:06:02,900 --> 05:06:08,979
I don't know about that

1452
05:06:16,099 --> 05:06:18,099
scary movie spinoff

1453
05:06:18,259 --> 05:06:27,340
Like a Charlie Sheen scary movie like scary movie for I play JFK somehow. Is that what you mean by that?

1454
05:06:27,340 --> 05:06:35,549
What do you mean? Like a scary movie you have to mean that

1455
05:06:38,080 --> 05:06:43,889
Disaster movie epic movie that type. I don't know. I'm too young

1456
05:06:43,889 --> 05:06:47,779
I would need it another five years or so. Maybe

1457
05:06:48,419 --> 05:06:54,080
Thanks for the thousand bits. Hey one one one two E

1458
05:06:54,619 --> 05:06:57,500
Thanks for the 250. This looks like a game. My dad plays on his iPad

1459
05:06:57,500 --> 05:07:00,619
We I've read this one, but it made me laugh. So I said it earlier

1460
05:07:01,259 --> 05:07:08,669
Thanks for the 250. Hey Das Knight. Thanks for the 300 bits. Hey, Jay loved watching you play GF

1461
05:07:09,229 --> 05:07:13,819
Hold on a bit gas a

1462
05:07:14,139 --> 05:07:15,819
Glad chat seemed to like it, too

1463
05:07:15,819 --> 05:07:20,419
I found memories playing the game on GameCube in the early 2000s with a girl at college

1464
05:07:20,939 --> 05:07:25,740
The game a thing we bonded over actually I was an English major and she took film studies

1465
05:07:25,939 --> 05:07:31,740
So we took it in turns to fight Borg while the other person explained recent lecture content sounds boring

1466
05:07:31,740 --> 05:07:37,939
I know but one fact she mentioned that always stuck with me was how Bella Lugosi died before plan 9 began production

1467
05:07:38,419 --> 05:07:41,740
Wow, so what did they do?

1468
05:07:42,500 --> 05:07:44,500
What could they have possibly done?

1469
05:07:44,619 --> 05:07:51,380
Hide that fact in the movie. That's interesting. Thanks for the knowledge

1470
05:07:54,840 --> 05:07:58,599
Yoda 985 gave 250. I said this one out loud, but I want to address it again

1471
05:07:59,200 --> 05:08:06,939
Remember the blood burger sounds like a fake rustling movie. You would say when Ronald McDonald kill somebody in the rumble. Yes. Yes

1472
05:08:09,470 --> 05:08:13,509
Peaceful Haley. Thanks for 250 speaking of when you talked about cheese when I was a kid

1473
05:08:13,509 --> 05:08:17,669
I would always pour shredded cheese in a bowl and just eat it like that all the time

1474
05:08:17,990 --> 05:08:22,470
So I would have bowl issues all the time as a kid because of my consumption of cheese

1475
05:08:22,790 --> 05:08:31,900
So one day my stomach was killing me wait bowl you bowel bowl

1476
05:08:32,220 --> 05:08:35,500
One day my stomach was killing me and I went to the hospital

1477
05:08:35,500 --> 05:08:40,139
he took my blood and etc and the doctor comes in and just shows me a grape and says you heard of these and

1478
05:08:41,020 --> 05:08:42,779
after that I had a

1479
05:08:42,779 --> 05:08:45,819
forced down prune juice and shit. I will never forget that

1480
05:08:46,580 --> 05:08:52,009
Has you heard of these ever hear these kid is called a fucking vegetable

1481
05:08:56,619 --> 05:09:04,869
Where did the grape come from? Yeah, why did the doctor just have a grape?

1482
05:09:05,389 --> 05:09:07,889
Was it all mushy and rotten?

1483
05:09:08,090 --> 05:09:15,119
Was that his pocket grape that he showed to young children to scare them and then make his joke to the parents?

1484
05:09:15,319 --> 05:09:28,060
That's funny. Thanks for 250. Hey errorless. Thanks for 250 any interest in chroma squad

1485
05:09:28,060 --> 05:09:30,060

practical RPG

1488
05:09:41,639 --> 05:09:46,040
About five stunt actors who decide to quit their jobs and start their own Power Rangers inspired TV show

1489
05:09:46,959 --> 05:09:50,200
Cast-actors purchase equipment and upgrade your studio. Wait, what is this?

1490
05:10:02,950 --> 05:10:05,750
Cool. I'll put it on the list looks alright

1491
05:10:06,669 --> 05:10:08,479

1492
05:10:08,479 --> 05:10:17,909
On the list. Thanks for the 250. Why don't we share the credits? Let's do it

1493
05:10:19,729 --> 05:10:21,729
incoming sub credits

1494
05:10:22,250 --> 05:10:24,549
Not until I move over

1495
05:10:26,180 --> 05:10:28,180
Changed to you all leaving the theater

1496
05:10:28,819 --> 05:10:36,529
Thanks for the subs guys. Probably wondering why it's going a little slow

1497
05:10:37,229 --> 05:10:39,520
because about

1498
05:10:39,520 --> 05:10:44,520
An hour ago an hour and a half ago the stream crashed because my VPN died

1499
05:10:44,840 --> 05:10:50,669
So these are the people that have subbed in the last hour and 30 minutes hour and 20 minutes. I

1500
05:10:56,180 --> 05:11:01,259
I can't the chat just what's exploded. It was so fast when I said the word VPN

1501
05:11:01,259 --> 05:11:05,020
I saw like a bunch of omega lows and like VPN omega. Like he was immediate

1502
05:11:11,299 --> 05:11:15,139
But anyways, thanks everybody sorry some you got

axed from this list

1504
05:11:19,229 --> 05:11:24,189
All right about that. It was the because of the server I picked won't be picking that one again

1505
05:11:24,869 --> 05:11:34,799
But we will finish the bits as always. I really appreciate anybody that subs this channel

1506
05:11:35,279 --> 05:11:39,119
nobody ever is obligated to

1507
05:11:39,279 --> 05:11:43,880
What you do and I can't I just I can't believe it. Thank you

1508
05:11:43,919 --> 05:11:48,279
Thanks for giving me money on a fucking consistent basis some of you for like years

05:11:49,040 --> 05:11:50,680
He's a lot. Thank you

1510
05:11:50,680 --> 05:11:59,529
Let us finish the bits ghost Ori. Thanks for the three dollars. Hey, Jerm I love this frame fun fact about gotcha force

1511
05:11:59,529 --> 05:12:02,729
I learned on the wiki the original voice actor who voiced the main character

1512
05:12:03,250 --> 05:12:05,930
Ko Shishido was originally going to be

1513
05:12:06,610 --> 05:12:11,209
Hello, Lugosi, but unfortunately he died during production. They had to hire his grandchild to do the lines

1514
05:12:12,810 --> 05:12:15,619
All right, you I

1515
05:12:16,540 --> 05:12:21,979
My eyes rolled a little bit when I saw Bella Lugosi, but then his grandchild coming in he saved it

1516
05:12:22,619 --> 05:12:24,619
Saved it my eyes came back

1517
05:12:24,619 --> 05:12:34,830
That's funny Yoda 985 thanks to the 250 if chat keeps acting up you should spend a week playing Pokemon as punishment

1518
05:12:35,189 --> 05:12:45,709
That would be punishment to me too. So I don't think so. I think that would punish me more than you guys

1519
05:12:50,599 --> 05:12:52,799
Super paradox thanks for five dollars Jerma

1520
05:12:53,319 --> 05:12:57,880
Now you have to do Pokemon streams. I would literally bother you about it every stream. Don't please don't

1521
05:12:58,400 --> 05:13:03,569
Please don't do that. Don't bother me every stream about playing for I'm not gonna play it

1522
05:13:03,569 --> 05:13:06,490
I guess it was like a little hypothetical thing

1523
05:13:07,169 --> 05:13:13,729
I'm not gonna know don't bother me every stream. I'll ban you. I'll just I'll ban you

1524
05:13:14,130 --> 05:13:26,369
Hey, you asked for this. I'll ban you. Oh, don't bother me about this every day. I'll ban you play trapeze simulator

1525
05:13:26,369 --> 05:13:27,750
I'll ban the okay

1526
05:13:27,750 --> 05:13:34,860
But I'm playing that tomorrow if that's a real game and it's not like some stupid thing. That's not even real

1527
05:13:35,220 --> 05:13:42,250
I'll play for like five minutes. It's not even real. It can't be real. Thanks for the five dollars paradox

1528
05:13:42,810 --> 05:13:50,549
Appreciate it. I don't want to ban you moss lion. Thanks for 250 a tip to all the youngins in Chad

1529
05:13:50,549 --> 05:13:52,549
It's never too late to develop a skill or talent

1530
05:13:52,709 --> 05:13:59,400
Even if you're as old as me and Jerma taller than him though, just to be clear lol. What was that for?

1531
05:14:00,240 --> 05:14:09,340
Started off so sweet there. It's a strong now that you said that I feel like you're not taller than me

1532
05:14:09,340 --> 05:14:13,729
I feel like that's about what that's what somebody says when they're not the thing that they just said

1533
05:14:13,889 --> 05:14:17,270
You got to add that in just to make sure people know but I don't think you are

1534
05:14:17,909 --> 05:14:30,000
Thinking face a yoda 985. Thanks for the 250 when it comes to cookie dough

1535
05:14:30,000 --> 05:14:34,080
You got to cut out the middle man. Just put some chocolate chips on vanilla yogurt

1536
05:14:34,119 --> 05:14:39,560
It'd be a little honey and go to the refrigerator grab four raw eggs and eat those instead

1537
05:14:40,439 --> 05:14:49,060
Hey dark soul. Thanks for the 250. I mean, thanks for making me a mod. That's pretty pog

1538
05:14:49,060 --> 05:14:54,540
I use reddit like every day and have positive karma if you eat your veggies and snort your Funko's chat

1539
05:14:54,540 --> 05:15:01,580
You can be like me, too

1540
05:15:06,400 --> 05:15:11,240
Thanks, hey opster narwhal. Thanks for three dollars and 57 cents Jerma

1541
05:15:11,240 --> 05:15:14,840
I just got told I just got told to kill myself while playing overwatch

1542
05:15:15,240 --> 05:15:18,240
So I thought I'd come to be here for a little while some positive energy

1543
05:15:18,240 --> 05:15:23,599
Also, I'm remastering Jerma walk. So that looks like a little cleaner and loops better, too

1544
05:15:23,680 --> 05:15:26,680
Why is everybody to fucking be so mean and hate each other online?

1545
05:15:27,400 --> 05:15:30,340
In like video games and stuff. Why I gave why they were to be like that

1546
05:15:30,779 --> 05:15:46,090
Why is everybody like tell each other that kill themselves? It's online. Yeah

1547
05:15:47,049 --> 05:15:50,099
It's just like it's

1548
05:15:50,099 --> 05:16:02,290
We need to like relax. No, I think that a lot of people would would like do well

1549
05:16:03,009 --> 05:16:10,610
With having some device that if it detects if it detects you do it

1550
05:16:10,610 --> 05:16:16,169
This is something you set up on your own if it detects you saying something fucking crazy. It just plays it back in your ears

1551
05:16:16,889 --> 05:16:20,150
Because believe it or not if you hear yourself

1552
05:16:20,869 --> 05:16:27,060
Say something fucking really bad and really kind of fucked up and crazy. It's actually kind of embarrassing it is

1553
05:16:27,580 --> 05:16:35,180
You know what I mean? If it's like just be like like in your ears, not anybody else's like hey

1554
05:16:35,180 --> 05:16:37,180
Why don't you fucking kill yourself? Oh

1555
05:16:37,779 --> 05:16:42,659
Why don't you fucking kill yourself? No, I didn't why don't you fucking kill yourself? Fuck. That's embarrassing. It's really embarrassing

1556
05:16:43,180 --> 05:16:48,560
Do I sound like that? I sound like that. Oh fuck dude. I'm sorry

1557
05:16:48,840 --> 05:16:53,360
I'm just like just kidding around that decided we'd really angry and fucked up there. I didn't I don't like that

1558
05:16:53,799 --> 05:16:59,689
This is why we clip off

1559
05:16:59,729 --> 05:17:04,610
Don't you know what I'm doing? All right, don't even I'm clearing that one

1560
05:17:04,729 --> 05:17:11,479
But my point is is like sometimes if you hear is something you say

1561
05:17:12,000 --> 05:17:19,610
You know, it's like but nobody else needs to know you just have to hear it and go. Ooh fuck. That was a little much

1562
05:17:20,290 --> 05:17:22,290
Okay, I'm gonna turn it down a little

1563
05:17:29,130 --> 05:17:32,310
Text community nights gonna be something else. God damn it

1564
05:17:32,930 --> 05:17:39,759
No, oh

1565
05:17:39,759 --> 05:17:41,759
It's gonna be everywhere

1566
05:17:42,040 --> 05:17:45,479
It's gonna be everywhere. Don't I know that I'm being recorded

1567
05:17:45,799 --> 05:17:50,720
See it worked now. I'm like I'm embarrassed for saying something like that out fucking rages

1568
05:17:50,720 --> 05:18:04,790
And now it's been recorded and I heard it star used to record people like that and play it back to them

1569
05:18:08,439 --> 05:18:12,529
Anger is a funny thing because once you stop being angry

1570
05:18:13,009 --> 05:18:18,810
You can you kind of look back and go that really wasn't even a big deal at all

1571
05:18:19,209 --> 05:18:27,330
like anger is such an interesting emotion because half the time when you look back it's like

1572
05:18:27,889 --> 05:18:31,150
What the what who cares

1573
05:18:31,709 --> 05:18:37,610
Why would I let that get to me? You're like who cares? It's not even a big deal

1574
05:18:38,330 --> 05:18:46,689
Anger makes you delete your jump King save. No, that's

1575
05:18:47,610 --> 05:18:59,319
Intoxication. I think they're two different things. I'm so

1576
05:19:00,319 --> 05:19:03,560
Long be only fucking thinking about that one of the bath tonight. Oh

1577
05:19:09,810 --> 05:19:11,130
No

1578
05:19:11,130 --> 05:19:13,770
Like is that I was saying it too

1579
05:19:14,450 --> 05:19:16,450
very very strongly and

1580
05:19:17,130 --> 05:19:21,470
That could have been like me in a game holding the voice chat button

1581
05:19:22,900 --> 05:19:24,619
my god

1582
05:19:24,619 --> 05:19:26,979
What have I done? What have I done?

1583
05:19:27,900 --> 05:19:30,970
What have I done?

1584
05:19:31,290 --> 05:19:40,709
Whatever. Anyways, let's keep going. I'm gonna make it my ringtone

1585
05:19:44,180 --> 05:19:45,380
Hey

1586
05:19:45,380 --> 05:19:47,380
Hey, cano canoli

1587
05:19:47,740 --> 05:19:50,189
Was that your name?

1588
05:19:50,189 --> 05:19:52,580
Okay. No, it's

1589
05:19:53,099 --> 05:19:58,299
Only thanks for the 400 bits and watching for a long time now subscribing your passive support

1590
05:19:59,180 --> 05:20:08,700
LGBT folks means a lot. Yeah, I've said this I've said this a bunch of times. Just do you you you know you

1591
05:20:09,259 --> 05:20:11,549
Nobody can tell you

1592
05:20:11,549 --> 05:20:16,810
No one can tell you who you are cuz it's you you know that nobody else knows you you know you and do you

1593
05:20:17,270 --> 05:20:28,619
Other people are gonna do them and you're gonna do you this, you know, you I still don't know you don't who knows me

1594
05:20:28,659 --> 05:20:35,950
You do like I can't tell you who you are

1595
05:20:37,919 --> 05:20:39,919
How the fuck would I know?

1596
05:20:39,959 --> 05:20:42,060
Hey, I

1597
05:20:42,060 --> 05:20:44,540
This is who you are. I know who you are

1598
05:20:45,099 --> 05:21:01,919
You know, I've done I've no idea. So why would I pretend to just kind of this is my theory on it

1599
05:21:02,400 --> 05:21:08,849
Whoever you are, whatever you whatever walk of life or

1600
05:21:09,650 --> 05:21:12,419
however, you

1601
05:21:12,419 --> 05:21:13,779
identify

1602
05:21:13,779 --> 05:21:19,340
It I do I can't what why would I not support somebody individually

1603
05:21:20,060 --> 05:21:26,750
Doing what they want to do with your life. It's your life. It's not mine

1604
05:21:26,750 --> 05:21:50,299
I can't tell you how to run it and I mean that with everything and that there's not much more for me to say I

1605
05:21:53,299 --> 05:21:55,299
Live my life the way that I want to

1606
05:21:55,740 --> 05:22:01,919
At as best as I can as best as I know that I can now how I know myself. I hope you do the same

1607
05:22:02,319 --> 05:22:16,439
That's it it's my money and I need it now that was word soup I

1608
05:22:21,330 --> 05:22:23,849
Mean it wasn't it wasn't word soup

1609
05:22:23,849 --> 05:22:29,599
It was you I guess it kind of was a little soupy wasn't it? But alright, but you get my point though

1610
05:22:29,759 --> 05:22:45,099
That's all that matters. What if I want to sell drugs and kill people? Well, that's illegal

1611
05:22:45,619 --> 05:22:52,159
Like that's we've we've all agreed that that killing people is not. Okay, that's

1612
05:22:55,119 --> 05:22:57,119
almost every living human knows

1613
05:22:57,479 --> 05:23:00,000
That like killing somebody is that's

1614
05:23:00,639 --> 05:23:06,880
Your you are taking over somebody's life. You are taking control of somebody's life by killing them

1615
05:23:07,240 --> 05:23:11,540
You are putting power over somebody else's life

1616
05:23:12,159 --> 05:23:32,180
That's how that works. So come on streamer says up. Wait, I decide when you like no

1617
05:23:33,500 --> 05:23:35,340
I'm moving on

1618
05:23:35,340 --> 05:23:42,580
Long story short, I I can't tell you how to be you only you know that and I'm not gonna tell you how to be you

1619
05:23:42,619 --> 05:23:44,619
Cuz you're the only one that knows

1620
05:23:44,619 --> 05:23:50,159
Fucking soup eat it up. Hey go. Okay. Thanks for the five dollars

1621
05:23:50,680 --> 05:23:57,319
Reddit jokes are all fun and games until they call one of your favorite characters a reddit character. Oh sad face. Oh

1622
05:23:58,340 --> 05:24:00,959
oh

1623
05:24:01,599 --> 05:24:03,180
Oh

1624
05:24:03,180 --> 05:24:04,459
No

1625
05:24:04,459 --> 05:24:09,380
Not my favorite character, but Slimer and

1626
05:24:10,529 --> 05:24:17,060
Qbert he's a fucking dork. He's mocking us. Yes, of course I am

1627
05:24:17,340 --> 05:24:23,569
You know how much shit I got for Slimer back here wait till your characters are reddit character and then we'll see how you feel

1628
05:24:24,169 --> 05:24:33,099
Who cares? It's a fucking news website. All right. Hey dinosaurs Rex. Thanks for the 250

1629
05:24:33,380 --> 05:24:38,880
Hey German for the German rumble

1630
05:24:38,880 --> 05:24:42,599
I know you're already spoiling us with getting us to vote for the characters that will get in but hear me up

1631
05:24:42,919 --> 05:24:45,279
You should try doing a character creation contest

1632
05:24:45,639 --> 05:24:50,709
Each member gets to create one character and the character with the most votes gets put into the rumble

1633
05:24:50,909 --> 05:24:59,790
It could be pretty cool that's an interesting theory the one issue with that is turning it into a popularity contest

1634
05:25:00,130 --> 05:25:04,520
Because let's say for instance somebody makes a character that knows is gonna get up votes

1635
05:25:05,000 --> 05:25:08,159
versus a character that's incredibly well made but

1636
05:25:08,799 --> 05:25:14,619
Isn't part of the like kind of popularity contest in a way, you know

1637
05:25:14,619 --> 05:25:17,700
I I would have to pick them if I was gonna do that

1638
05:25:17,700 --> 05:25:19,700
I would go through and I'd pick the ones that I would want to put in

1639
05:25:24,729 --> 05:25:35,240
Yes, something like you up vote something so if we were to do something like that it would only be for a certain amount of

1640
05:25:35,240 --> 05:25:43,979
Slots like they would be one community character or like I have three community characters or maybe the community characters could be

1641
05:25:45,060 --> 05:25:49,139
part of their own tag team, you know if there was like a three like a six-way tag or like a

1642
05:25:49,779 --> 05:25:53,520
Tornado tag match it could be the community characters versus

1643
05:25:54,700 --> 05:26:00,340
Sam and Max shit. That's one of the fucking matches. That's not kidding

1644
05:26:01,220 --> 05:26:09,540
They'll probably be in it though. It's like a thousand different characters that haven't been made. But now it's a good

1645
05:26:09,540 --> 05:26:21,790
It's a good thought only give it a shot. Yeah, I would just choose because then it would just be like, oh Jerma

1646
05:26:21,790 --> 05:26:24,490
Just picked these he didn't pick mine

1647
05:26:25,009 --> 05:26:26,369
but he

1648
05:26:26,369 --> 05:26:31,169
There was just there was a ton of things to choose from when he picked just ones that he wanted and that would be it

1649
05:26:31,490 --> 05:26:34,619
Hey the the

1650
05:26:35,099 --> 05:26:36,139

Thanks for 250. I remember back when German refused to play some ads even when chat was begging for it now

1666
05:28:08,659 --> 05:28:10,819
Jerma talks non-stop about fast food chains

1667
05:28:10,819 --> 05:28:15,639
It even makes us watch their adverts and he does it for free Ernie Pog

1668
05:28:15,799 --> 05:28:20,970
Nobody has to pay me to tell you that the McChicken is like one of my favorite things in the world

1669
05:28:20,970 --> 05:28:23,849
I would somebody why would they need to be a transaction there?

1670
05:28:23,889 --> 05:28:29,200
Like that's just a fact from my mouth like the McChicken is my favorite one of my favorite things in the world

1671
05:28:29,200 --> 05:28:33,759
I nobody has to pay me to say that that's just a what it that's just a real fact

1672
05:28:33,759 --> 05:28:51,060
Oh, I had it too and it fucking trumpeted off at the end. Damn it. Whatever. It was close and then it just like

1675
05:29:05,849 --> 05:29:16,139
I was wondering the FTK service could be used. Oh, I don't I don't think so because I think they're I don't know

1676
05:29:16,139 --> 05:29:21,470

Please please please please look into playing armored core for answer for the PlayStation 3 I'd pog so hard

1681
05:29:52,150 --> 05:30:01,419
But it's not your thing. That's fine, too. It might be I would take a little bit of research

1682
05:30:01,900 --> 05:30:13,669
Why for in particular though? Dr. Noob Stein. Thanks for the $5 German if you tried I bet you could be huge in Japan

1683
05:30:13,750 --> 05:30:19,159
You'd be in that little box in the corner of the screen doing wacky reactions while some girl gets

1684
05:30:20,080 --> 05:30:24,189
Spanked in front of a studio audience with everyone laughing wait

1685
05:30:24,189 --> 05:30:29,950
What and you do the look of me as your trademark and the Japanese audience would collectively lose their shit and cheer for you

1686
05:30:29,950 --> 05:30:31,130
You know what I'm saying?

1687
05:30:31,130 --> 05:30:48,700
I'm sure someone from chat could get you on a show in the corner doing just wacky reactions

1688
05:30:48,700 --> 05:30:52,680
Oh, yeah, I would do it. I would do I would go on one of those

1689
05:30:52,680 --> 05:30:55,630
I would go on with those shows and just do like that

1690
05:30:56,669 --> 05:31:02,229
It's like three or four times that would be with like the hands up

1691
05:31:02,229 --> 05:31:09,220
I'll just hit you that would be fun

1692
05:31:09,220 --> 05:31:12,639
And there would be an excuse to be in Japan and visit Japan eventually

1693
05:31:12,639 --> 05:31:19,119
I don't know if anybody has any pretty knows anybody that does do Japanese TV shows

1694
05:31:19,119 --> 05:31:27,220
I don't know how that's probably pretty that's probably not very many people. I don't know that'd be fun a goober juice

1695
05:31:27,220 --> 05:31:36,000
Thanks for 250 if the look of me taunt becomes a TF2 taunt would you play TF2 again? I don't I don't know man

1696
05:31:37,159 --> 05:31:49,580
the look of me taunt the look at look at look at me is just like me pretending that you're talking and

1697
05:31:51,000 --> 05:31:53,700
Like look at me. I'm talking look at me like I

1698
05:31:54,419 --> 05:32:05,709
Have that he hates to him too. No, it's not the lion pose. Look at me is. Oh, look at me

1699
05:32:05,709 --> 05:32:10,790
I'm fucking know everything. I'm talking. Oh, I everything I'm saying is fucking stupid. That's that's what the look at me is

1700
05:32:10,790 --> 05:32:16,409
It's like you am I you're explaining your joke. Don't explain your joke

1701
05:32:16,409 --> 05:32:19,849
Well, I don't people don't but people have probably have no idea what it's probably some people here

1702
05:32:19,849 --> 05:32:23,500
They don't even know what you're talking about. But why they say why they saying look at me

1703
05:32:23,659 --> 05:32:34,290
Let's be honest if you're still here, there's no way right like if if yours here right now, you probably know

1704
05:32:34,369 --> 05:32:40,200
Well, somebody said it was the lion taunt. So I had to correct them. No, it's the one where you go

1705
05:32:40,200 --> 05:32:58,040
Look at me. Let's see. Somebody said that. Hey go over here juice. Thanks for 250. Hey dumbass 985

1706
05:32:58,360 --> 05:33:05,759
How come brownies always get the attention? I wish German would bake me easily in an oven

1707
05:33:06,240 --> 05:33:12,009
But no for real. Yeah, play armored core or zone of the enders. What what?

1708
05:33:12,490 --> 05:33:18,889
I think this is a typo. Hey germ a lot about the turkey joke. Thanks for five dollars

1709
05:33:18,889 --> 05:33:23,330
I bought more bits just to tell you the name was about the mr. Bean turkey on head joke

1710
05:33:23,689 --> 05:33:32,340
So you did just admit to the crime. I had no idea about the other turkey joke. Yep. Yep

1711
05:33:32,500 --> 05:33:43,250
Well, you got me. We have a few more bits to do but we're gonna call it an end. Good night guys

1715
05:33:51,720 --> 05:33:58,919
Wherever you are, we do have a little bit more to do we have sticks renegade for 250 Pokemon or Jackie Chan stunt master

1716
05:33:59,319 --> 05:34:01,319

Would play I definitely would play Jackie Chan stunt master before Pokemon. That's a fact

1718
05:34:07,049 --> 05:34:14,439
Moo means moo. Thanks for the $4 bella legosi died in an unfortunate walk-in of an accident. That's unfortunate

1719
05:34:14,759 --> 05:34:25,000
Hey edge. Thanks for three dollars German return on smart click maps. Thank you. No, you're gonna make a dick happens every time

1720
05:34:26,639 --> 05:34:29,319
Maximum watts thanks for $5 a German

1721
05:34:29,319 --> 05:34:32,560
I just want to say I really appreciate your words on the matter of people telling each other that to kill themselves

1722
05:34:33,080 --> 05:34:39,479
Not that anyone cares, but I've seen family members and next-door neighbors take their own lives and it never leaves me as a human being

1723
05:34:39,479 --> 05:34:42,080
I know people are going to joke and laugh and that's okay

1724
05:34:42,439 --> 05:34:47,639
Doesn't dark place today remembering a lost childhood friend interesting how you bring that up today. Thank you

1725
05:34:48,439 --> 05:34:53,169
Let me know I can look nobody wants to

1726
05:34:53,930 --> 05:34:57,849
Feel shitty. You know, I mean nobody wants to feel bad about stuff

1727
05:34:58,490 --> 05:35:04,169
That's why it's I've always thought

1728
05:35:05,049 --> 05:35:12,040
There was some it was something like a level as you just kind of just don't you don't like

1729
05:35:13,159 --> 05:35:19,200
Especially in a setting where you don't know anybody and I guess that's the reason why people do it. It's why people do anything like that

1730
05:35:20,040 --> 05:35:23,119
you could say and wicked just awful shit because

1731
05:35:24,200 --> 05:35:26,880
These pretty people don't know who the fuck I am and who cares

1732
05:35:27,639 --> 05:35:37,990
so it's unfortunate, but that's just kind of the nature of

1733
05:35:38,790 --> 05:35:42,069
The internet where it's just kind of people just kind of say crazy shit

1734
05:35:42,790 --> 05:35:45,029
That's the way it is at this point

1735
05:35:48,060 --> 05:35:54,220
It doesn't mean that it can't affect somebody, you know, I mean if like somebody if you hear that and it's like well that sucks

1736
05:35:55,459 --> 05:36:00,979
Cuz I like know somebody that happened to do that and fuck now you have to think about that

1737
05:36:01,900 --> 05:36:06,580
Where on the other end it's just like somebody just kind of talking shit, right?

1738
05:36:07,619 --> 05:36:09,860
Just the nature of kind of anonymous

1739
05:36:10,540 --> 05:36:15,099
Everybody because the person that's saying it does not know that about you and

1740
05:36:15,819 --> 05:36:21,599
You know that they you don't know anything about them. They don't know anything about you and it's just kind of noise

1741
05:36:23,159 --> 05:36:27,779
It's way that's a way I would call it word soup. Yeah

1742
05:36:36,240 --> 05:36:45,490
Word soup, this is nonsense. This is all nonsense. What?

1743
05:36:46,090 --> 05:36:49,720
Am I like hearing myself talk? Am I like going crazy?

1744
05:37:00,669 --> 05:37:03,630
TL DW too long didn't watch

1745
05:37:04,590 --> 05:37:09,520
Try to relax on the fucking internet

1746
05:37:10,240 --> 05:37:13,000
You know, you just just pump the brakes a little

1747
05:37:13,720 --> 05:37:28,360
Just relax the board and we're cooped up. No, but you don't I mean

1748
05:37:29,200 --> 05:37:32,779
But people like talk shit

1749
05:37:33,340 --> 05:37:37,959
but this talking shit and then his

1750
05:37:38,639 --> 05:37:52,750
Trying to be as like awful as possible. You know what I'm saying? I like jokey shit talking

1751
05:37:52,750 --> 05:37:54,750
I think a lot of people do I do

1752
05:37:54,830 --> 05:38:03,099
It can be fun

1753
05:38:03,099 --> 05:38:04,380
regardless

1754
05:38:04,959 --> 05:38:09,240
Thanks for the $5 and it does affect people as you can see

1755
05:38:09,759 --> 05:38:16,990
Hey app key. Thanks for the $5 derma any plans to play DBZ games. It'd be pretty neat

1756
05:38:16,990 --> 05:38:20,270
I think I don't want to watch the DBZ show before I play the DBZ games

1757
05:38:20,270 --> 05:38:22,830
Which has not happened yet and might never happen

1758
05:38:23,470 --> 05:38:38,880
We'll see a somnus. Thanks for the $5 Jeremy so excited for the League of Legends and Valorant back-to-back stream tomorrow

1759
05:38:41,139 --> 05:38:45,659
Pokemons more likely. I'm gonna have that tier system set up. I got a question though

1760
05:38:45,659 --> 05:38:51,619
Does chat ever overwhelm or exhaust you? I can't imagine being called a fucking weirdo for hours by thousands people without losing my mind

1761
05:38:52,419 --> 05:38:54,919
Um, yeah

1762
05:38:54,919 --> 05:39:00,200
No, I mean if I start to well, that's when I turn streams off, you know, I'd like

1763
05:39:00,880 --> 05:39:04,299
If it's like okay, I've kind of had enough

1764
05:39:05,000 --> 05:39:11,610
Not of chat but just in general like usually I kind of just gauge after four or five six hours if it's like

1765
05:39:11,610 --> 05:39:14,810
I got kind of gonna take a break and kind of get out of here

1766
05:39:15,330 --> 05:39:20,400
So

1767
05:39:20,400 --> 05:39:23,840
No, not necessarily overwhelm or exhaust but I

1768
05:39:24,680 --> 05:39:29,569
kind of just gauge how I currently feel on a really

1769
05:39:30,450 --> 05:39:32,450
almost minute-to-minute basis as

1770
05:39:32,569 --> 05:39:38,409
You see some streams can be and I mean the reason why I'm making streams four to five hours now

1771
05:39:39,169 --> 05:39:42,810
This one will be about six, but it's just because of medical reasons

1772
05:39:42,810 --> 05:39:47,729
I'm just trying to not sit in the same place for more than four or five hours of time and

1773
05:39:48,689 --> 05:39:51,209
It's it's helping so that's the reason for that

1774
05:39:52,009 --> 05:39:53,810
but no

1775
05:39:53,810 --> 05:39:59,849
You'll know I've if I really need like to take a break. I usually just go alright, like I'm out of here. I

1776
05:40:00,689 --> 05:40:08,290
Don't I don't make a big deal out of it. I'm not I oh you guys are so exhausting the absolute fuck out of me

1777
05:40:08,290 --> 05:40:12,169
I can't take it anymore. Goodbye. No, that hasn't really happened

1778
05:40:12,810 --> 05:40:15,500
It doesn't really happen at all

1779
05:40:15,540 --> 05:40:22,520
But yeah, it usually goes pretty smoothly

1780
05:40:23,990 --> 05:40:31,479
Thanks for five dollars. Hey travel boy. Thanks for five dollars. Your take on LGBTQ is the libertarian take on LGBT q

1781
05:40:31,919 --> 05:40:34,240
We finally got a political opinion out of you

1782
05:40:34,840 --> 05:40:38,029
You're centrist. Oh

1783
05:40:46,209 --> 05:40:50,159
Oh

1784
05:40:50,159 --> 05:40:53,840
How does it wait? How do you go from libertarian to centrist? Oh

1785
05:40:59,700 --> 05:41:08,919
Here we're going down the rabbit hole

1786
05:41:09,720 --> 05:41:16,950
He's a centrist libertarian communist. Yeah, that's whatever. That's whatever. That's fine

1787
05:41:17,549 --> 05:41:26,740
Let's just say that that's all right. I'm gonna just say Bernie Pog. It'll fix it

1788
05:41:29,900 --> 05:41:38,959
You guys already do I I don't

1789
05:41:39,580 --> 05:41:45,180
We don't talk politics, but I give you beliefs and I give you kind of stances on stuff

1790
05:41:45,180 --> 05:41:49,259
I think you could piece together kind of how I feel about the world

1791
05:41:49,259 --> 05:42:03,880
I think it wouldn't be very hard at this point hates the lower class. Oh

1792
05:42:06,159 --> 05:42:11,860
man

1793
05:42:11,979 --> 05:42:20,729
He picks that message. Well, it was one there you're gonna it's gonna happen to you eventually

1794
05:42:21,569 --> 05:42:24,959
but no, I whatever I

1795
05:42:25,520 --> 05:42:27,959
Everybody you can think what you want. It's fucking be a mystery forever

1796
05:42:30,029 --> 05:42:34,389
Thank you edge for the five dollars. You're my about 500 more bits to do this turn on smart clip max

1797
05:42:34,389 --> 05:42:36,389
I'm not gonna turn on smart clicks

1798
05:42:36,549 --> 05:42:40,740
No, I'm not turning it on. No, no, no

1799
05:42:41,659 --> 05:42:44,459
I'm not gonna turn it on. I'm not gonna turn on smart clips

1800
05:42:44,459 --> 05:42:49,580
I'm not gonna do it and you're not gonna be able to make me do it. Mr. Turtle. It's not gonna happen

1801
05:42:53,090 --> 05:42:54,689
John Oliver there

1802
05:42:54,689 --> 05:43:15,930
It's weird new character. John Oliver's not like he's a person. He's a guy

1803
05:43:17,130 --> 05:43:29,040
You guys are too fun. All right dinosaurs Rex. Thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents

1804
05:43:29,560 --> 05:43:33,040
Remember you skipped a few donations in the past few streams also be more careful

1805
05:43:33,639 --> 05:43:43,099
Have I I've tried to be pretty I've been I thought I've been pretty on top of it. Have I miss been missing a couple?

1806
05:43:47,509 --> 05:43:55,970
I skipped one. Oh gooberry juice. Thanks for the 250. Hey, there's one right there. Could you please ban me?

1807
05:43:55,970 --> 05:43:56,610
No, for real

1808
05:43:56,610 --> 05:43:59,930
I got some work to do tomorrow and I need to make sure I don't procrastinate by watching you

1809
05:44:00,049 --> 05:44:02,849
It would really help me out if you could just ban me for 24 hours

1810
05:44:03,330 --> 05:44:08,729
Yeah, I'll make it easy for you. Chewy brownies are redditor brownies. Also hash house a go-go sucks

1811
05:44:08,810 --> 05:44:11,970
Their burger buns were so wet. I swear that the chef spat in my

1812
05:44:12,369 --> 05:44:15,970
Anyways, thanks again, you'd be at Vandus Purse. Yeah. Bye

1816
05:44:52,599 --> 05:44:57,020
He was just joking. Why'd you do that? I

1817
05:44:57,700 --> 05:45:01,470
Don't see it. Just joking in this comment. They said that I I

1818
05:45:02,349 --> 05:45:06,130
Have to make sure I don't procrastinate by watching you. I have a lot of work to do tomorrow

05:46:47,610 --> 05:46:58,700
We got Bernie. I'm not reading Bernie Bernie. Is Bernie like a streamer now?

1826
05:46:59,000 --> 05:47:01,000
Is he live every day?

1827
05:47:02,380 --> 05:47:11,439
Are you guys lying to me or is like Bernie Sanders streaming? What does he play? Oh, I didn't play

1828
05:47:11,439 --> 05:47:13,439
He doesn't what do you mean? What does he play?

1829
05:47:14,319 --> 05:47:19,470
