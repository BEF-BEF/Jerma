Oh, it even came with a free gift gun open it. Oh, we open a car pack open up the nice card pack

Are those cool? What good timing you should put the free gift in that binder. All right

166
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,619
Nice cards are very nice trading cards and are the thing in thing right now

167
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:39,099
I understand that they're very popular among even amongst Pokemon. I know you collect a lot of nice cards. I'll give you reward

168
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,940
How about you aim for nice cards of 25 different for now?

169
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,160
You want to look at the nice cards you have to open the binder. Let's go see them

Custom debit card. I guarantee at least a hundred of you guys have this for a custom debit card

173
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:30,890

174
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:38,700
This was medium M. Well, this one is rare. This one's like a medium

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,289
Because you notice the trash can no, I won't do it

You just watch exercise TV with Pikachu. I'll be back in a minute

188
00:29:43,589 --> 00:30:44,640

00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:55,700
Stuck in stretching exercise. I should do this one. You're a deadbeat. What I just dropped

190
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:09,410

He's learning about exercises. All right fatigue relief. All right. Are you ready? Let's change channel

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:38,730
What do you know? Let's do a quiz channel. All right, so though I've got a I've got a ball fucked up

193
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,730
He's just doing exercises. No

194
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:56,319
He wants the news. All right fine on the news. There you go. All right

00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,799
We're gonna go outside and play this is bad

196
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:13,339
You know what? No

197
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:25,269
Eyes are hurting

198
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,000
He looks like he's about to fall down he's going like

199
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,119
All right, it's time to go side

200
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:53,640
Yeah, we can't just sit her all day it's time to go outside outside

201
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,519
Maybe another two minutes

202
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
At the end of this segment we're going outside we're playing

203
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,839
That's enough that's enough

204
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:40,000
Wild Pikachu would appears to be interested in TV. Okay, because he wants the TV turned on no outside

205
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:50,559
Pikachu wants the TV turned on. Oh, no, he's addicted. He's addicted to television. No, we're going outside

206
00:33:51,480 --> 00:34:00,230
Yes, it wants to keep watching some more TV. No

207
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:16,639
He's angry. We're going out there and we're gonna play dig some holes or something. I caught it

208
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:35,889
Get out there no, it's no no more TV outside. Oh, no, he's like a he's like a little brat

209
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:58,380

210
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,760
He's attacking me he's why is he attacking me

211
00:35:40,989 --> 00:35:56,880
You only need to watch each show all the way what I don't want to put the anime on I wasn't a fat one

212
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:28,460
You missed it you missed it you missed the show the static on all right fine, you like this shit the bitrate

213
00:36:28,980 --> 00:37:04,599
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's do a bit rate fight. All right, let's go. Let's go

214
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:22,570
Let's go. I'm done one more report. Have you watched shopping squirtle to the end?

215
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:30,000

216
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay, I'll say that report data

217
00:37:32,000 --> 00:38:43,380
This is like I'm like I'm on space ghost you're doing great. You're doing great. Keep at it by the way

218
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,820
It's guess all you viewers at home didn't realize I have power in the fucking real world

219
00:38:50,260 --> 00:39:36,079
All right, let's see those hands. All right, no more of this shit. What if we didn't watch the

220
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:48,429
Losing why am I losing channels? Wait, this is the same thing. No, I don't want to watch this. No, no, we need to watch the

221
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:57,219
Where's the shopping channel? All right chopping channel. Just watch chopping channel. Enjoy it Pikachu

222
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:23,550
Eat this disc. No, this is I'd like this one. I'll eat the other one. Oh you like this

223
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,949
What is it like a thing? You like a little toy you ride on it like a horse or something a

224
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:45,119
Lot of money I don't have that much money. Sorry Pikachu. No, I can't afford it

225
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:26,789
What happens when you watch every TV channel, I don't have any money I need money but ring girl is gonna get you

226
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:37,710
quizzes, okay

227
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,730
Oh, it's a guy from a special way. No, it's not

228
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:52,150
This is the character that looks like that

229
00:41:53,869 --> 00:42:01,690
Lucario is what he looks like. He's got the same scheme as the wrestler of Pokemon in sinner in sinner

230
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:20,420
All right, now we're gonna watch the quiz show quiz channel and we're gonna do quizzes for money

231
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:29,559
How do we play though do I get you can I like call do I have to like put my face up to it

232
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,030
How do we how do we do this? I don't I don't play Pokemon. I don't know what that is

233
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:46,739
Get out of the way. That's not right. Oh

234
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,239
It is right, correct

235
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,579
Commander is in the lead. I'm sorry. No, never mind

236
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:15,099
Pokemon like a piece of chocolate who will take the chance?

237
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:23,019
Oh

238
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,989
It's underneath it I thought that was like a hook or or like a bottom

239
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,389
Peek-a-boo quiz. How do we even answer these correctly? Oh, so I see it now

240
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:54,570
It's that thing. It's that it's the one the one we just saw right? It's blaziken

241
00:43:54,929 --> 00:44:06,719
How do we how do I go on this show? That's the one from smash probably

242
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:19,460
There's no winner. I want to get on this show. Maybe I can get

243
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:32,719
Bulbasaur Bulbasaur

244
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:51,829
We did it, okay now it's time for no more TV that we watched every show

245
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,190
Pikachu we watched every show that we have and

246
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:00,389
Sadly enough. We only have

247
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:03,510
seven full television shows available to us

248
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:38,730
It wants to watch anime part one. What anime part one and we already saw this I'm dumb going

249
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,369
You really are like a fucking five-year-old

250
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,690
You guys don't know

251
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:49,980
Kids love watching the same episode. They've seen of a TV show a thousand times like if you DVR

252
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:52,599
the same episode of

253
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,159
Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

254
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,329
Little kids will want to watch the same one every fucking day. So this does not surprise me at all

255
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,329
And eventually it gets to the point where you can you can say every line of the whole show

256
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:05,829
for instance

257
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,829
the episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

258
00:46:07,909 --> 00:46:14,050
Where Goofy doesn't know how to bake a cake. I know every line I could recite the whole thing

259
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,710
Yeah, I don't want to watch this

260
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,000
We don't watch the whole thing though

261
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,239
He's sad about this. All right, that was fun

262
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:50,429
He's gonna want to watch this every day

263
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:02,789
This is just babysitting well, let me make it more accurate

264
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:15,070
Sometimes fight and that's when they turn the whole world upside down

265
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:33,230
Bros like these can't stay mad for long in no time. They're back

266
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,989
It's Pichu and Pichu

267
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:42,929
See one without the other

268
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:49,210
Perfect pal stick brother to brother side by side. It's Pichu and Pichu

269
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:55,570
Well, it seems like the Pichu brothers and their friends are ready for another day of fun at their Pokemon Clubhouse

270
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,320
Oh

271
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
Sounds like smoochums got a problem

272
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,199
Smoochums all excited Pokemon are carrying little cards and they're shaped like a crescent moon

273
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Oh

274
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:42,050
This sounds very interesting so the other Pokemon want to see for themselves

275
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,150
Honey honey, honey, don't put that in your mouth. Don't put that in your mouth

276
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:44,010
Oh

277
00:49:54,219 --> 00:50:03,050
Get off of that get down from there don't find that don't find that get down just please

278
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:14,980
It's hell here, okay

279
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:22,039
Just turn the volume down turn the volume down I gotta go

280
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:32,090
Tell you

281
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:47,360
I've been around my sister had kids and I know people that have kids. That's it. That's tricky. That's tricky

282
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:56,469
It's a lot of work. Shout out to all the fucking moms and dads out there. Oh, but we got it

283
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:58,469
We got to get you off fucking TV. I

284
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,920
Had the mic unmuted when I first came in

285
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,199
All right, no one news

286
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:22,500
It wants to watch PNF. It's PNF. We're already watching PNF

287
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:33,960
No, no more no more no more of that here, okay

288
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:48,460
Phineas and Ferb we just watched this whole thing

289
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:50,920
No, you know what?

290
00:51:50,920 --> 00:52:03,159
We're done. Yes. I have that's very odd. That isn't what it says in your reports

291
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:14,820
I mean if you do sign up to be one of those people that has

292
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,139
You get like all these fucking devices that are in your house

293
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,480
Listen to this if those you that don't know if you sign up to do

294
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:28,539
one of these watch TV and report back things

295
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,219
They literally make you wear a device in your house

296
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:37,199
like like an ankle bracelet if you were on like house arrest and

297
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,730
It kid fucking keeps you on there and attracts everything that you've ever do

298
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:51,730
It's like we want to be able to catch what like network you're on at any second and you have to wear it you have

299
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,170
To have it on at all times

300
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:58,219
How do I know this?

301
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,340
because

302
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,820
funny story about that

303
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:06,809
long time ago my family

304
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:12,690
Decided maybe we would try this that sounds interesting and once we found out what we had to do

305
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:17,849
And we found that we were gonna have to wear these like weird fucking devices. It was like I

306
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:21,289
Don't think we want to do this anymore

307
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:38,739
That's a sitcom you had to wear a fit bit that we had was weird, but they would they were gonna pay you though

308
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,820
That's the thing. I think they like paid you this is like 17 years ago 18 years ago

309
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:49,940
I think they would pay you if you like actually did all the weird shit

310
00:53:50,699 --> 00:54:02,130
Anyways, we're gonna watch the news all the way through Jeremy. You're the reason why community got canceled

311
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:07,739
Oh

312
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,940

02:44:23,809 --> 02:44:29,129
This is a new original character. Those are not lightsabers. They are

773
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:32,069
they are

774
02:44:32,069 --> 02:44:38,000
beam spears and I said I said obi-wan I

775
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:41,899
Said those names that was just me referencing what they could look like

776
02:44:42,979 --> 02:45:07,909
Someday Gar Vader. Well, he doesn't know he's not sick. How about just cover Gar Vader

777
02:45:10,819 --> 02:45:16,780
Original character. No, it's keeping Gar Vader

778
02:45:17,719 --> 02:45:54,639
Original character. No, oh D one. Oh D one Kenobi gar. Oh D one Kenobi

779
02:45:54,680 --> 02:46:07,549
That's fucking terrible. Just keep it. Oh, do you want gar gar of things?

780
02:46:07,909 --> 02:46:27,739
It's not even Odie in the picture. I'm just playing this in your house

781
02:46:34,379 --> 02:46:49,079
All right, have you finished watching this yet? Dad was busy not even watching TV anymore

782
02:46:49,079 --> 02:47:04,440
Oh shit Bugleberry. I heard Bugleberry eating a spider

783
02:47:11,319 --> 02:47:21,489
Attacking me. What have we not seen? Oh, wait, the egg. What was it? It was Bulbasaur. Oh

784
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:28,180
I don't know why my brain's bright for some reason. I thought that was like a

785
02:47:28,819 --> 02:47:35,600
How many bars you have on a cell phone? I was like was it what if this Wi-Fi signal losing my mind

786
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:39,100
Look, it was like it was like right down there. It was in the perfect spot

787
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:42,260
I was like, why is it a Wi-Fi on here? All right

788
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:47,489
Blaziken battles with greater

789
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:51,780
intensity when it faces a

790
02:47:52,459 --> 02:47:53,899
tough

791
02:47:53,899 --> 02:47:56,659
opponent it will

792
02:47:57,420 --> 02:47:59,180
battle while

793
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:04,579
intense flames shoot from its wrists

794
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:20,020
Marowak grew ferocious by

795
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:30,899
Wielding bone as a weapon. However, it is thought to have been

796
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:33,629
weak

797
02:48:33,629 --> 02:48:38,559
originally

798
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:51,940
Don't yawn buddy Pikachu status buddy Pikachu

799
02:48:52,700 --> 02:49:00,260
All right, so let's it's currently 12 36 a.m. It's been 40 minutes. Holy shit

800
02:49:00,659 --> 02:49:08,979
Hey a new viewer Eric new viewer here. Can you explain this game to a newbie, please? Thank you and love the stream

02:49:58,870 --> 02:50:04,909
Move out of the way you're blocking the TV. I don't want to watch this what you're blocking the TV

02:51:20,829 --> 02:51:41,520
What's this all right Seth found the three leaf clover looking for a four leaf clover

819
02:51:42,219 --> 02:51:50,799
No four leaf clover. Oh

820
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:52,879
Pog I guess

821
02:51:52,879 --> 02:51:59,899
Who's this guy?

822
02:52:00,059 --> 02:52:02,059
Why does it look like I drew you?

823
02:52:05,579 --> 02:52:08,540

824
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:20,620

02:53:44,260 --> 02:53:48,489
Can't hear it if they go

833
02:53:48,530 --> 02:53:57,729
It's oh, it's like I'm like a full probably four and a half seconds behind

834
02:53:58,250 --> 02:54:22,989
What's it doing to me?

835
02:54:22,989 --> 02:54:24,389

836
02:54:24,389 --> 02:54:32,059

How do I go forward in time I have to go backwards in time and then go forwards in time

840
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:09,469
Why do you look like a dream person? I don't know

841
02:55:16,389 --> 02:55:19,350

842
02:55:20,590 --> 02:55:23,540
Like that get the egg right

843
02:55:23,540 --> 02:55:43,379
They get the egg question, right? Please. Please look what would you guys like submit that somewhere patch it?

844

845
02:55:52,940 --> 02:56:10,159

846
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:15,500
Pokemons this section is pretty cool

847
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:18,829
It's all

848
02:56:18,829 --> 02:56:19,989
Pokemon

849
02:56:19,989 --> 02:56:27,110
This is really really really this is very interesting

850
02:56:27,709 --> 02:56:36,120
Same one that I drew with the lightsabers and everything. No, I don't see anything

851
02:56:36,799 --> 02:56:54,319
Wait, where is this? I'm trying to find it with like the cigarette coming out of the mouth and the lightsabers

852
02:56:54,719 --> 02:57:14,190
Well, you got it there is I want to see this is that's fucking hilarious. Okay, I'm not clicking on any more links

853
02:57:14,549 --> 02:57:39,670
I'm not clicking on any more links. I was like that was that's gonna fuck me up for life. Check the art channel

854
02:57:39,670 --> 02:57:52,739
What are you talking about? You ruined it? Oh, okay. I thought you talked about like the art channel on the website

855

Yeah, you guys got some fucked up images. I'm not I'm not there's nothing gonna be here. Wait a minute. What I didn't sell this

856
02:58:22,620 --> 02:58:31,959
But even everybody I'm your host smuggle

857
02:58:35,909 --> 02:58:45,020
Where are you getting this definite

858
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:47,700
Quiet

859
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:51,219
the decisiveness is

860
02:58:52,420 --> 02:58:58,700
Losing with originality the artist demonstrates an original creative vision unseen in others. See it's an original character

861
02:58:58,700 --> 02:59:04,219
It's not anything related to Disney or or Jim Davis. Neither one of those original

862
02:59:07,459 --> 02:59:08,659
OC

863
02:59:08,659 --> 02:59:33,500
This is a repost. What the fuck mods? I can't believe you like I like the fuck you one

864
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:40,809
All right, I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think I'm out of here

865
02:59:40,809 --> 02:59:48,540
I think this is I think this is where I have this day as be done. I can't I don't think I can handle this anymore

866
02:59:49,260 --> 03:00:03,110
Save the game. I'll save it. He hates this what I mean, I don't didn't say that. I don't hate this we talking about

867
03:00:03,670 --> 03:00:18,620
He's never gonna watch TV with Pikachu ever again to find a rating on this game

868
03:00:18,620 --> 03:00:23,100
I mean the video game is a tube

869
03:00:23,620 --> 03:00:28,340
But like it's like the interesting the fun factor is like an eight

870
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:32,680
so I mean

871
03:00:32,680 --> 03:00:42,079
It's fun. It's like funny and it's it's a wholesome. It's just watching TV with Pikachu

872
03:00:42,079 --> 03:00:49,340
I give it as I give it up. I get a seven. I give it a seven for

873
03:00:50,020 --> 03:01:18,819
On the moon. Who is it? I wouldn't pay attention. What are you gonna do? What am I playing switch?

874
03:01:18,819 --> 03:01:20,819
I'm gonna play Animal Crossing when it comes out

875
03:01:20,979 --> 03:01:24,370
All right, just turn it off

876
03:01:24,409 --> 03:01:34,790
Thank you. Turn it off. Let me just like spell this one more time. Okay, I'm gonna save it

877
03:01:34,790 --> 03:01:40,100
I'm fucking gonna get some food. Somebody said pizza like an hour and a half ago. It's their fault

878
03:01:42,659 --> 03:01:53,989
Somebody said pizza like an hour an hour and a half ago and now it's your fault. Toxic paint cube

879
03:01:58,180 --> 03:02:01,559
The new programs are scheduled to begin at uh today at 5 a.m

880
03:02:01,959 --> 03:02:17,979
Because I can't report I can't skip ahead. I'm soft-walled. I have to go back and then go forward

881
03:02:18,860 --> 03:02:30,409
Everyone you spent like two hours on one level of pinball game. I don't like to remember

882
03:02:35,370 --> 03:02:39,829
How'd she get up there

883
03:02:40,110 --> 03:02:45,659
He's saying

884
03:02:53,930 --> 03:02:55,010
Nintendo

885
03:02:55,010 --> 03:03:05,959
You said you'd eat the disk. I'm not gonna eat this. All right, I'll see you guys later

886
03:03:06,639 --> 03:03:11,479
So plan is tomorrow on tomorrow. I'm probably gonna

887
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:19,229
Do tomorrow well, I want to you're gonna hate this you're gonna hate this but um, I

888
03:03:21,750 --> 03:03:33,899
Know you a lot of you guys don't hate this. I want to uh, I'm I want to play Binding of Isaac again

889
03:03:33,899 --> 03:03:38,040
You're gonna hate this

890
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:45,309
Again, I'm like addicted to it. I want to like play it so bad. I so badly want to play it

891
03:03:45,309 --> 03:03:51,739
I'm like it. I've scratched the itch and now it's like I want to play I'm gonna play Binding of Isaac again tomorrow

892
03:03:51,979 --> 03:04:06,280
He's addicted either that or

893
03:04:08,200 --> 03:04:10,719
There's one other thing that I might do as well

894
03:04:11,360 --> 03:04:14,420
It depends on what uh, it depends on how I feel

895
03:04:15,020 --> 03:04:31,479
Not Nancy Drew. Oh you fucking liar

896
03:04:32,120 --> 03:04:38,149
We'll see. I'm not sure yet, but I do want to play at least at least

897
03:04:38,950 --> 03:04:42,790
Like two to four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow

898
03:04:42,829 --> 03:04:48,350
We'll do something else but I want at least four hours of Binding of Isaac tomorrow or two hours at least at least

899
03:04:48,549 --> 03:05:02,479
Two hours, you understand? I'm compromising with you. That's a whole screen. That's not two hours

900
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:16,940
It's like 20% of a stream like 30% of one stream two hour

901
03:05:16,940 --> 03:05:25,420
But my average stream time is like six to eight hours two to three hours is like 20 to 40 percent like 30%

902
03:05:26,059 --> 03:05:28,549
I'm playing it. That's all there is to it

903
03:05:33,239 --> 03:05:35,239
You said four to six

904
03:05:35,239 --> 03:05:43,579
I said two to four but play purple place look at like what you can't even play that game

905
03:05:43,579 --> 03:05:56,670
That's like that games undown loadable. Yes, you can I don't think you guys want me to play purple place

906
03:05:56,870 --> 03:06:04,040
That's funny for five seconds and then oh, no, he's playing fucking purple place. I'm gonna leave

907
03:06:04,040 --> 03:06:18,270
I'll go do something else for like an hour. All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll do a couple things tomorrow. Let's say

908
03:06:19,149 --> 03:06:26,129
When it's German crap

03:06:28,459 --> 03:06:38,329
Within the next hundred years I'm not gonna destroy this he's like fun in cute games are like collectibles

910
03:06:38,329 --> 03:06:42,250
I don't care if I didn't like the game not this one the one before it

911
03:06:42,250 --> 03:06:45,170
I actually like the one before it but I was gonna eat the disc in my anger

912
03:06:46,510 --> 03:06:51,030
He's a cool that nicely the collect. Look at like eat of this. I'm not gonna break anything

913
03:06:54,930 --> 03:06:56,930
Wendy's Wendy's I

Don't I don't get this what what does that have to do with anything?

915
03:07:04,010 --> 03:07:14,100
What does this Wendy's image have to do with anything? It's because I hit the mic. Oh

916
03:07:16,540 --> 03:07:20,920
God damn it. Okay, let's go back to a little bit earlier today

917
03:07:22,190 --> 03:07:26,870
Almost just about six and a half hours ago. We had dark soul 250 from dark soul

918
03:07:27,510 --> 03:07:30,750
Here's some sober bits last night was something anyway

919
03:07:30,750 --> 03:07:32,750
I do like whiskey a lot not more than vodka

920
03:07:32,909 --> 03:07:36,190
But Jamison equals good Johnny Walker equals cigars and assholes

921
03:07:36,430 --> 03:07:42,260
Let's think about opinions everyone's got just like how

922
03:07:42,860 --> 03:07:52,129
You have one too. We should do 50 lm man. Thanks for the five dollars

Sound the call to war Shogun German and some opinions are wrong say every say assholes

924
03:08:04,860 --> 03:08:15,260
You thought that's the thing. You thought I was gonna say that next part. Nope. Thanks with the five dollars lm, man

925
03:08:15,540 --> 03:08:24,209

926
03:08:25,840 --> 03:08:29,120

927
03:08:29,399 --> 03:08:32,379
So you're in the post you're in the post 30, you know

928
03:08:32,379 --> 03:08:36,760
It's like started drawing this in hopes that I would finish before my birthday, but I ran out of time

929
03:08:37,319 --> 03:08:38,899
ran out of time

930
03:08:38,899 --> 03:08:43,780
Hope that I could use this as a bribe in order to receive an exclusive rats birthday song

931
03:08:44,059 --> 03:09:00,600
This is the sandwich. Is this like the dirty sandwich? Let's see. Yeah, it is

932
03:09:00,899 --> 03:09:09,920
This is the dirty sandwich. I'm just show it on screen

933
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:14,309
Well dirty as an old as an old

934
03:09:14,950 --> 03:09:36,020
Get it on here almost done. This is fucking really good

935
03:09:36,540 --> 03:09:45,489
Yeah, that's the that's the turkey sandwich that sat in the car for like six and a half hours or in a day or something

936
03:09:45,809 --> 03:10:01,139
The oblivion sandwich. Yeah, that's fucking incredible though. It's so good. It's so fucking good

937
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:08,180
Thank you for this and happy birthday and you want to spell you want to rats?

938
03:10:08,979 --> 03:10:18,770
Let's see if I can get it here we go. Hey, happy birthday. Have a birthday again when

939
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:21,979
I'm the match me

940
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:37,079
Just found one. It is we just ran by it was pretty wild. That's kind of a problem

941
03:10:37,079 --> 03:10:47,430
Where they coming in from but thank you again. Thanks for the insanely talented artwork. You got you got some skill here real skill

942
03:10:47,930 --> 03:10:58,930
Happy birthday. Hope it's a good one. Oh shit. I lost my fucking I lost my stream. I lost my stream

943
03:10:59,569 --> 03:11:04,469
There it is. Hey LM, man another five dolls from LM, man

944
03:11:06,879 --> 03:11:10,760
Jerma sama with this legendary skill in leading an army of

945
03:11:11,520 --> 03:11:16,159
Conscripted as she garu. Have you ever considered playing the total war Shogun games?

946
03:11:16,159 --> 03:11:25,590
My brain is way too small for those. I'm capable of throwing a pinball against the wall and getting angry

947
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:30,780
I I do not have the patience to play any of those games like that

948
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:34,659
I've seen a lot of people say dude, you should play civilization. It would be so much fun

949
03:11:35,139 --> 03:11:37,139
Man, you should check out

950
03:11:38,149 --> 03:11:44,350
Europa, whatever it's called. Do you know what's it called your Europe? What's it called? What's that one called?

951
03:11:44,430 --> 03:11:56,319
Is this like three of them, right? Yeah, Europa universe sales. Yeah, I've heard that I've heard

952
03:11:57,260 --> 03:12:02,799
What's the other one? There's another one. That's really popular. What the hell is it called?

953
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:10,139
Crusader Kings that there it is. Yeah, those games take

954
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:14,799
Like dozens of hours to even understand how to play them correctly

955
03:12:15,079 --> 03:12:20,799
I would get annoyed and bored and frustrated in the first four hours and it would be I

956
03:12:22,129 --> 03:12:26,450
Couldn't I would just lose my mind. I just don't have the brain patience for games like that

957
03:12:27,010 --> 03:12:32,670
Even on my own time something like that is like hey, you wanna play Crusader Kings. I'd be like no

958
03:12:33,409 --> 03:12:40,290
No, not in a million years. Like I wouldn't even do that on my own time even like it before streaming

959
03:12:40,530 --> 03:12:53,120
That's something I just wouldn't play. I need to throw rocks at people. I mean

960
03:12:53,399 --> 03:13:00,940
I gotta roll a pinball rock into a guy. That's that's pretty much what you saw today was the extent of most of the

961
03:13:01,559 --> 03:13:07,989
Strategy games you'll see me play on this channel. What about stronghold 2?

962
03:13:08,510 --> 03:13:17,309
Total war Warhammer total Warhammer 2 is easy to learn maybe but we're talking about me

963
03:13:17,729 --> 03:13:21,229
We are talking about me

964
03:13:21,229 --> 03:13:29,620
But probably not you'll you'll probably never see a game like that on this channel and that's when I could be really certain of

965
03:13:33,090 --> 03:13:38,489
Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250 if you want to play a better voice-activated military game find a copy of Tom Clancy and war

966
03:13:38,489 --> 03:13:44,010
I don't think the PC steam version is voice-activated though. So find a ps3 or Xbox free

967
03:13:44,649 --> 03:13:51,659
Xbox version if you want to try it. I love microphone games. They're fun

968
03:13:55,729 --> 03:14:00,049
General ours. Thanks for the fourteen dollars fourteen hundred bits from general ours, Germany

969
03:14:00,049 --> 03:14:08,559
Where did you get that flint water? What do you mean flint water? Is that what they have on the shelves are you talking about?

970
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:28,079
I'm drinking coffee. I'm drinking coffee. It's coffee. It's not it's not

971
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:44,420
It's coffee. It's good. I like it. No, but they're nothing on the shelves anymore. That's why I've got I got that

972
03:14:44,420 --> 03:14:52,760
Hey, I bought some of this Fiji water cuz it's the only thing that fucking was existed people go buy all the

973
03:14:53,200 --> 03:15:01,909
Regular bottled water and they just and they leave the Fiji like a shit like I gotta buy like a case of Fiji

974
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:16,290
There's nobody's gonna buy the case of Fiji. It's good though. I mean, I love this stuff. It's great

975
03:15:16,409 --> 03:15:24,600
It's really good, but I don't don't really want to buy cases of it. Anyways

976
03:15:25,760 --> 03:15:29,399
Desoids Dutch capture, but thanks for the thousand bits new drinking game

977
03:15:29,399 --> 03:15:34,719
Take a shot every time German says press forward. I would advise against doing that

978
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:44,879
Definitely, but it's not a good idea would advise against doing that

979
03:15:46,770 --> 03:15:51,430
Sir linkerton, thanks with five dollars. Hey German glad to make it to a stream usually watch on YouTube

980
03:15:51,750 --> 03:15:55,709
Thanks for giving us all a distraction from the scary times. The world is in right now

981
03:15:56,030 --> 03:16:00,899
Would there be another keep talking stream with Joel? Oh, probably not

982
03:16:01,100 --> 03:16:03,700
We'll probably move on to something else if we ever play something again

983
03:16:04,020 --> 03:16:08,979
If we ever ever monkey ash German Pluto if we ever why do you say that ever does that mean?

984
03:16:08,979 --> 03:16:13,739
He means he's never gonna play with him again. He must hate Joel. I think he hates Joel. I think he hates Joel

985
03:16:13,979 --> 03:16:16,219
He said ever

986
03:16:16,219 --> 03:16:19,319
Yeah, so we'll probably when we ever do something again

987
03:16:20,239 --> 03:16:25,620
I'll probably do something else new games come out. They're worth playing

988
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:43,530
He punched Joel I did not do that I didn't do that you're a liar and you're making that up new games aren't coming out

989
03:16:43,530 --> 03:16:46,649
Yes, they are. It was like three or four new games coming out over the next

990
03:16:47,290 --> 03:16:59,459
Few months a furry. Oh, I missed this. This is a lot of money Freudian weapon. Thanks for the $40

991
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:06,639
4,000 bits from Freudian weapon. That's that's just shy of fucking $50, dude. Thank you

992
03:17:07,120 --> 03:17:13,959
Doom and Resident Evil 3 got delayed off. Really? It's unfortunate

993
03:17:14,319 --> 03:17:16,260
They say hey Jerma

994
03:17:16,260 --> 03:17:20,020
I just want to say that I appreciate you streaming things are getting kind of scary in the world as you know

995
03:17:20,340 --> 03:17:25,219
The fact that I can still tune into your streams with some laughs definitely helps bring so much needed comfort. Thanks so much

996
03:17:25,899 --> 03:17:33,090
Love you in chat. Yes, wash your hands everyone. Yes

997
03:17:33,690 --> 03:17:38,500
Take some precautions when you do anything when you go anywhere

998
03:17:39,020 --> 03:17:43,790
Try to limit the amount that you go out

999
03:17:44,190 --> 03:17:50,159
To especially the places that have a lot of people in them, especially if you're in an area that you know, I've seen

1000
03:17:51,409 --> 03:17:56,290
Cases there's some countries that are in lockdown right now. Just be careful and be smart

1001
03:17:56,569 --> 03:18:07,379
Yeah, well, like I said the other day and yesterday too. Hopefully this blows over pretty soon

1002
03:18:07,659 --> 03:18:10,020
hopefully we can get ahead of this because

1003
03:18:11,559 --> 03:18:16,950
It's been a while since something like this has happened, right?

1004
03:18:16,950 --> 03:18:25,680
What was the last the last big kind of scary pandemic was but h1 h1 n1 stars or something

1005
03:18:25,799 --> 03:18:35,379
But not this big. Yeah, 2003 Ebola, but I don't think Ebola was this

1006
03:18:36,930 --> 03:18:42,030
Widespread around what was I don't think I don't remember it being like that. Was it not that I remember

1007
03:18:42,030 --> 03:18:46,049
I mean like Disney World is closed. That's

1008
03:18:46,649 --> 03:18:50,440
Not that's not even close to what how scary, you know

1009
03:18:50,819 --> 03:18:55,879
Well that not even what I mean not even close like they're they closed Disney World

1010
03:18:56,239 --> 03:19:03,799
Disney World has never been closed ever in the history of it ever being opened except for only think I think two or three days

1011
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:10,709
So this is I guess enough to have to warrant doing something like that

1012
03:19:11,030 --> 03:19:15,110
Last time Disney World was closed was on 9-eleven

1013
03:19:15,110 --> 03:19:34,139
I mean that you don't just close it just I mean the whole park is you can't even go but like

1014
03:19:34,959 --> 03:19:38,840
Hopefully this is all over soon and we can kind of get back to normal over the next few months

1015
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:44,120
When summertime kind of really rolls around here, especially in the US hopefully

1016
03:19:44,969 --> 03:19:57,290
Cases die down and it can you know, we can move on. Hope so, but be careful Saints got robbed

1017
03:19:57,329 --> 03:20:02,959
Thanks for the five dollars just five dollars. Thank you Saints got robbed all the list goes

1018
03:20:02,959 --> 03:20:08,680
Thanks for the three dollars and watching your constant since 2011

1019
03:20:08,719 --> 03:20:14,110
Your streams have helped me get through a lot of rough patches, especially recently also your now

1020
03:20:14,549 --> 03:20:20,229
Withered muscles helped encourage me to get fucking huge while I'm still somewhat young though lately

1021
03:20:20,229 --> 03:20:25,750
I've been eating a tahini paste and doing bicep curls for YouTube sub celebrations and I never felt better about myself

1022
03:20:26,620 --> 03:20:30,620
Thank you for the near decade of content and for always striving to be the best gamer

1023
03:20:30,739 --> 03:20:36,799
You can be much love. Good luck to you. I never condoned that I never told you to anybody to do that

1024
03:20:36,799 --> 03:20:40,520
Do not do that. Are you doing that on your own? Good luck. Thank you

1025
03:20:40,680 --> 03:20:48,760
Thank you who sell juniors for the five dollars funny streamer people happy

1026
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:57,280
Noka Noka, thanks with three dollars German love seeing you play Pokemon channel today your Viva pinata streams

1027
03:20:57,280 --> 03:21:02,549
Maybe remember it being a game. I always wanted it as a teen. I actually went and bought a copy

1028
03:21:02,549 --> 03:21:04,979
I hope to see you stream it more. It's so

1029
03:21:05,540 --> 03:21:14,959
Chaotically cute cute games on stream is always great. Have a good day. You too. You will see the return of Viva pinata

1030
03:21:14,959 --> 03:21:25,989

1031
03:21:26,590 --> 03:21:32,350
Ruins my brain to the point that it made me enter my credit card information and give you money

1032
03:21:34,940 --> 03:21:41,940
I'm sorry to hear that peaceful Haley. Thanks for the 250

1033
03:21:42,319 --> 03:21:44,829
Derma, can you admit you farted? It's okay

1034
03:21:44,829 --> 03:21:48,850
We all shit ourselves from time to time that didn't I didn't but it sounded like it and that's funny

1035
03:21:49,250 --> 03:21:52,579
Peaceful Haley again. Thanks for 250

1036
03:21:52,739 --> 03:21:56,450
Derma you um, you obviously don't know your Star Wars lore

1037
03:21:56,969 --> 03:22:07,059
Obi-Wan saber has always been blue. He only used a green saber once when he's spoiler. I'm not reading spoilers

1038
03:22:07,649 --> 03:22:12,290
Luke used Anakin's blue saber and he made his own saber, which was green shaking my head

1039
03:22:12,290 --> 03:22:17,450
Jerma, come on if you need to know Star Wars lore come to me. I wasn't I wasn't doing Star Wars

1040
03:22:17,450 --> 03:22:19,250
Lord, that was a fucking beam spear

1041
03:22:19,250 --> 03:22:26,000
That's why I said it incorrectly because that wasn't that's not a reference to any Disney related properties

1042
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:34,600
But thanks for the five dollars

1043
03:22:34,600 --> 03:22:42,379
Return that shirt. No, I will continue to wear it and pretend to be a fan of the show

1044
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:50,329
Movies and the movies and the show there's a show I could say that there's a show

1045
03:22:50,729 --> 03:23:00,840
There's a show a loopy FA. Thanks for the thousand bits loopy. No message just ten fucking dollars

1046
03:23:01,040 --> 03:23:12,760
Let's roll the credits janitor is gonna come sweep by you here. Here come the credits. Thanks for watching

1047
03:23:12,760 --> 03:23:16,469
Thanks for sticking around. We'll see you tomorrow for

1048
03:23:16,790 --> 03:23:25,399
More stuff. Thanks everybody. I want to play Binding of Isaac. It's fun and

1049
03:23:27,319 --> 03:23:30,200
I scratched it and I have to keep scratching it

1050
03:23:31,079 --> 03:23:37,899
Also, there's a couple of the things I want to do. We'll see what happens tomorrow. I will see you tomorrow

1051
03:23:38,260 --> 03:23:42,159
Thanks again, and thank you to

1052
03:23:42,479 --> 03:23:46,620
Thragnel for the five dollars buy better coffee instead of that curdling swill from yesterday

1053
03:23:46,920 --> 03:23:48,379
No, okay

1054
03:23:48,379 --> 03:23:55,549
It's that is a nice cold brew that coffee that I'm drinking is a is a cold brew that you keep in the fridge

1055
03:23:56,510 --> 03:24:02,229
The reason why I look so gross is because I put almond milk in it and I sit here and I drink it and I sip

1056
03:24:02,229 --> 03:24:08,579
On it for an hour and what happens is the almond milk separates from the coffee and looks like shit

1057
03:24:08,700 --> 03:24:13,239
It's not the coffee. It's the almond milk. I'm putting in it, but I like almond milk

1058
03:24:13,239 --> 03:24:20,680
I like putting on the milk in my coffee. Oh, that's why it looks like that. It's a nice cold brew

1059
03:24:20,680 --> 03:24:33,379
What you're seeing why not mix it with a spoon because I don't have a spoon up in my office in fucking quotes

1060
03:24:33,860 --> 03:24:37,920
I don't have a spoon up here. I mean I got what kind of have us

1061
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:47,840
What am I gonna put what I'm gonna do with it? I'm not gonna put my finger in it. No, that's gross

1062
03:24:48,120 --> 03:24:54,520
Hey frozen Thor 516. Thanks for the 250. Hey German. Thanks for the stream as usual

1063
03:24:54,520 --> 03:24:56,520
You said you never played any of the Pokemon games before

1064
03:24:57,120 --> 03:25:02,459
What if you consider playing them perhaps the new one that came out for the switch with silly rules such as chat picks

1065
03:25:02,459 --> 03:25:10,299
What Pokemon you can use something like that again? Thanks for the stream and keep being awesome. I will try

1066
03:25:10,739 --> 03:25:20,079
Glad you think that right to drive better I can be better and always be better right? Um, I don't I home

1067
03:25:20,079 --> 03:25:22,079
I don't really want to play Pokemon

1068
03:25:23,020 --> 03:25:24,379
Pokemon is

1069
03:25:24,379 --> 03:25:30,059
It's cool. I respect the franchise, but I don't have in any interest in it at all

1070
03:25:30,059 --> 03:25:37,110
I really don't zero like unless it's a TV game or like take pictures with Pikachu

1071
03:25:37,110 --> 03:25:44,290
I don't actually really care at all about the main line Pokemon game

1072
03:25:44,290 --> 03:25:53,120
I just never have and I never do and I never will it's just the way it is. Sorry. It's the way it is

1073
03:25:53,120 --> 03:26:03,639
But thank you for the suggestion silent serenity. Thanks for the 250 as others have said, I'm glad you chill here with

1074
03:26:04,159 --> 03:26:09,079
I'm glad to chill here with you guys while we're quarantined video games are a great time killer

1075
03:26:09,079 --> 03:26:13,879
I've been playing the city skylines over the past couple of days and I definitely recommend it for wasting time

1076
03:26:13,879 --> 03:26:16,319
I actually planned on streaming city skylines

1077
03:26:16,360 --> 03:26:26,440
Should I we talked about that a few weeks ago like a month or two ago, right that be fun

1078
03:26:26,440 --> 03:26:31,290
Could I can I handle that I want to be very clear about this

1079
03:26:31,530 --> 03:26:38,760
Can I handle that like can I handle that one? Absolutely not. Yes, do it tomorrow

1080
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:44,819
Can I fucking handle that? Is that like a I get to sit there and learn the whole game for like 12 hours

1081
03:26:44,819 --> 03:26:57,440
It's easier than sim City doesn't take that long. It's good. There's some systems kind of need to learn

1082
03:26:57,440 --> 03:27:10,319
It's 30 minutes to learn for it's easy to pick up. It's easy. It's super simple. Okay. Okay, we'll do it tomorrow

1083
03:27:10,520 --> 03:27:22,440
All right, we'll do it tomorrow. We'll play city skylines tomorrow, but I'm getting my I'm getting my fucking couple hours of binding of eyes again

1084
03:27:25,440 --> 03:27:34,120
We'll do that tomorrow. And that's the end. Thanks for watching. We'll see you tomorrow. Same time around

1085
03:27:34,639 --> 03:27:38,409
3 4 p.m. Pacific and

1086
03:27:38,889 --> 03:27:42,889
Goodbye and good night

1087
03:27:42,889 --> 03:27:47,909
Sergio but right at the end 250 got back from work to see you still stream and I had a co-worker act totally normal

1088
03:27:47,909 --> 03:27:53,709
I'll shift and start violently coughing into the trash can next to him. Jesus. I told him. Hey, I love you

1089
03:27:53,709 --> 03:28:00,209
But please don't cough on the line. We had to decontaminate the entire kitchen mid shift. That's shit scary

1090
03:28:00,350 --> 03:28:03,989
Glad I could share a laugh after today today. That's not good

1091
03:28:04,350 --> 03:28:10,909
It's gotta be careful. I mean at that here's the thing though

1092
03:28:11,270 --> 03:28:20,799
There's there's there's there's like coughing and sneezing and there's like normal stuff and it's like is that what's what's wrong with that person?

1093
03:28:20,799 --> 03:28:23,159
You don't want to get too

1094
03:28:23,479 --> 03:28:29,200
Too into it and to like hysteria, you know, I mean that that's how it's somebody just sneezed in this in this place

1095
03:28:29,200 --> 03:28:33,280
I am I gotta get the fuck out of here. You know what I mean? You just gotta be careful

1096
03:28:33,280 --> 03:28:37,760
We it's it's a like the web jacket just said it's allergy season 2

1097
03:28:38,079 --> 03:28:40,000
so

1098
03:28:40,000 --> 03:28:44,200
There is enough to be concerned about for sure

1099
03:28:44,479 --> 03:28:52,399
But we just we got to be careful with I know it's scary and it's it's not a fun time for really anybody

1100
03:28:52,600 --> 03:29:00,959
But we don't also want to feed into the like the absolute hysteria, but you never know

1101
03:29:00,959 --> 03:29:06,840
I know but I know but still but it's the same reason you got people buying 30 fucking

1102
03:29:07,079 --> 03:29:12,270
rolls of toilet paper like they like I've seen the images of people that got like a

1103
03:29:12,549 --> 03:29:21,870
Full a full closet of like 5,000 rolls of toilet paper. It's like that's that's all that's a lot. That's a lot

1104
03:29:22,510 --> 03:29:30,420
People buy like 10 gallons of milk like milk goes bad in like not even 12 days, right?

1105
03:29:30,459 --> 03:29:33,360
Like what are you buying 10 gallons of milk?

1106
03:29:33,879 --> 03:29:40,870
Who's gonna drink all that milk in the next like week or two? Just freeze it

1107
03:29:40,870 --> 03:29:45,959
But what people people are freezing milk?

1108
03:29:48,489 --> 03:29:50,450
If I ever put milk in my freezer

1109
03:29:50,450 --> 03:30:01,620
I'm gonna freeze nine gallons of milk and you got like the people that are buying all this shit

1110
03:30:01,620 --> 03:30:06,649
And then they're selling it on like the internet for like fucking a thousand percent more

1111
03:30:06,649 --> 03:30:11,290
It's like God if people are just trying to get like a one stack of toilet paper

1112
03:30:11,290 --> 03:30:14,530
Now you're talking about they might have to it's not there because everyone's been

1113
03:30:14,690 --> 03:30:19,329
Panicking and buying it all and you got these guys that have going in there and buying it to sell it to those people that

1114
03:30:19,329 --> 03:30:21,329
Didn't get there in time at like a

1115
03:30:21,850 --> 03:30:26,370
20,000 percent premium it's like Jesus

1116
03:30:26,370 --> 03:30:29,770
I always end up in like a pandemic aren't we supposed to like help each other

1117
03:30:30,250 --> 03:30:34,649
You know I'm saying like that's that that seems a little strange

1118
03:30:39,819 --> 03:30:45,659
No, I feel the same. Okay

1119
03:30:46,219 --> 03:30:51,540
When there was like a baseball game or something and it's like, oh, maybe like three or four of us will go to the game

1120
03:30:51,540 --> 03:30:57,260
Oh, okay. Yeah, how about your tickets? Oh, there are none left. Oh, there are no more tickets left

1121
03:30:57,299 --> 03:31:00,540

1122
03:31:01,139 --> 03:31:05,229
Hey, I got tickets for you 200 bucks for the fucking nosebleeds

1123
03:31:05,750 --> 03:31:17,899
Okay, thanks cool. But what's that again? Those those are like those are like forty one dollar seats

1124
03:31:23,569 --> 03:31:24,969
boomer ball

1125
03:31:24,969 --> 03:31:31,430
You're with a communist

1126
03:31:31,430 --> 03:31:35,719

1127
03:31:37,379 --> 03:31:39,379

03:31:40,059 --> 03:31:42,540

Sorry, excuse me ma'am and sir

1132
03:31:55,379 --> 03:32:01,479
I'm a communist and I don't agree with the fact you have your whole entire fucking Subaru outback full of toilet paper

1133
03:32:02,059 --> 03:32:08,020
That's not that's not the one it is

1134
03:32:18,739 --> 03:32:24,620
He's going on a socialist rant. No, I have not that's not what that is not even close

1135
03:32:25,100 --> 03:32:32,700
No, don't twist it. Don't twist it on me. Don't twist it. Don't twist it on me. Don't twist it

1136
03:32:32,700 --> 03:32:40,180
I don't want to hear from any of you starting to twist. What's happening to me? What's going on?

1137
03:32:41,180 --> 03:32:44,520
Don't twist don't I don't want anybody to twist this on what's happening?

1138
03:32:50,059 --> 03:32:55,809
Sorry, I had something all right, I don't want you don't twist it on me. That's not what I was saying

1139
03:32:56,209 --> 03:33:03,629
Anyways, have a great day. Have a great rest of your night

1140
03:33:05,809 --> 03:33:11,920
Go very juice. Thanks for 250 right at the buzzer here. No, like for real German. It's okay. You can admit that you farted

1141
03:33:18,690 --> 03:33:23,049
We all do it there's no reason to be embarrassed about it

1142
03:33:23,049 --> 03:33:28,370
I mean not all of us part live on stream in front of thousands of people a small percentage of which may be

1143
03:33:29,170 --> 03:33:35,250
Into farts. I mean that would be fucking embarrassing, but you know, it's okay if you do. Why did I read that out loud?

1144
03:33:37,280 --> 03:33:38,780
Okay

1145
03:33:38,780 --> 03:33:43,079
Goodbye. Good night. See you tomorrow. Have a fucking wonderful rest of your evening

1146
03:33:43,659 --> 03:34:11,559
