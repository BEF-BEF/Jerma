00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:16,359
Hello. How are you doing? It's good to hear. I'm doing pretty good too. Just hanging out. Loving

2
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:28,600
up PS4. Gonna do something I've wanted to do for a while, and that's play Days Gone. I know the

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:37,030
reviews aren't that great. It's not a 10 out of 10 experience, but we're gonna just throw a whole

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:49,159
day away. Pretty good title, I think. But hope you're doing good. We're gonna get started.

5
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:59,020
I'll give you the rundown for this week. Yes, we are very early today. That's because we're

6
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:07,670
gonna be very early tomorrow too. Back-to-back days starting somewhere before one or two o'clock.

7
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:25,340
EU stream. Stop being so early. I can't help it. Sometimes I have to. But yeah, so what's

8
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,939
gonna happen here is I wanted to play Days Gone. It's a new game. It's got motorcycles

9
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:38,969
in it, so that's an automatic plus one ladder grid. It's open world zombies. This might be

10
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:48,579
terrible. This might be fun. I don't know. This could be the worst game I've ever played.

11
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm willing to give it a try. So we're gonna go today and tomorrow. If Days Gone is fun,

12
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,590
then tomorrow we're gonna keep going. If Days Gone, we actually just wasted a whole day.

13
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,900
Then I won't play it tomorrow, and we'll do something else tomorrow. Then Saturday and Sunday

14
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:20,180
is gonna be Sam and Max Season 2, Episode 3 and 4, and MS-DOS Night 2. Told you I was gonna

15
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:35,219
make that a weekly thing. That is the plan for this week. Porn 2. It sucks, but you may enjoy it.

16
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:41,939
I'm going in with an open mind. I doubt it would be the worst game you've ever played.

17
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:53,879
I don't think it will either. It's very bland. So this is what, like, the tasteless sponge

18
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:10,580
of video games. Isn't this like 50 hours long? It's very playable. Alright. It's a coin flip

19
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:21,460
if it's gonna be enjoyable or not. Okay. Well, let's take that chance. Days Gone.

20
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:29,689
Yeah, like, you ain't getting this one back. I really hope at the end of this stream,

21
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:36,919
I don't say, I wish I could get this day back. But let's go. Days Gone, we're gonna start

22
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:54,090
it. And here it comes. Days Gone. Here comes the opening cut scene. Days Gone, more like eat ass.

23
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:05,099
Yeah, I know, right? Alright. Wait, wait, wait. Why is there no sound? Should there be sound

24
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:18,810
right now? There should be, right? What a waste of a day. I already know. It's a waste.

25
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:29,100
Is this a loading screen? Why do we have, like, the Witcher 2 base game level of loading

26
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:38,970
screen? No, this is, like, the original Witcher. Do you guys remember that shit?

27
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:54,709
What is going on right now? It can't be this long. This is, that's the initial load time,

28
00:04:54,709 --> 00:05:15,480
right? I got, I have nothing, I have nothing to say. I have nothing to say. I don't have anything.

29
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:26,170
It's just a long loading screen. That's it. That's all. I don't have anything else to say.

30
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,269
This better be good. No, I already put a warning in the title. You've been pre-warned.

31
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:47,910
This is kind of, uh, is unbelievable though. I have class soon. You may as well just go,

32
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,189
you know what? If you got class soon, you may as well just go study, like,

33
00:05:51,269 --> 00:06:00,339
extra study time. I can't hear anything. All right, brightness. This doesn't need to be

34
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:07,259
brightened. Set your brightness so that days gone is barely visible. Now, I always hate that

35
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,319
shit. It's never correct. I'm gonna go with, like, seven. I'm gonna turn HDR on or off.

36
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:29,339
Can I not turn it on? I can't even turn it on. I cannot hear anything. Is it because

37
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:39,449
this is too low? Playing on seven brightness. What do you mean? I need to be able to see.

38
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,970
Nobody plays these games at, like, two brightness. You can't see anything.

39
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:58,339
Is it possible to play? All right, let me turn this up on my end because this is, like, this is

40
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:05,899
bait. You know what I mean? This is bait. Okay, now I can hear it. Press any button.

41
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:16,810
Days gone. Welcome. Here's the options menu. Controls. Display. Oh, all right. I'm staying

42
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:24,279
at seven brightness. Audio. I mean, I don't know. Who cares? Dialogue. Sound effects.

43
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,420
They'll just keep everything normal. I don't like the music being the same. Gameplay.

44
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:35,500
Difficulty. Put it on. Just keep it on. Wait, there is no hard. Guys, there's no hard,

45
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,610
so you can't make fun of me this time. You can't make fun of me. Normal is hard.

46
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Vibration off. This ain't 1995. We're just gonna keep it like that. What else is there?

47
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:03,540
User interface. XP indicators are off. Well, we're gonna get an entire huge tutorial.

48
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:11,769
We're gonna get, like, a four to five hour tutorial. This is my last chance here. This is

49
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:30,709
it. This is my final chance to, like, do something else. I've done to skip. No, I'm, I locked it in.

50
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:38,519
Hope that wasn't a mistake. It's a good game. I know. Why am I, like, sitting here going,

51
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:46,600
like, oh, no, this is my last chance. This is it. After this, it's a video game.

52
00:08:46,600 --> 00:09:04,950
Relax. This is not my audition for American Idol. I'm gonna be okay. Like, it's a game.

53
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,509
We're just gonna enjoy it. Now, this is my one shot.

54
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,350
Knife.

55
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,789
That's, yeah, what did he say?

56
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,870
We need subtitles.

57
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,360
Hold on, I can't do this yet. Wait.

58
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,519
Wait, we need help. She's been wounded. What? What's wrong with her? Well, she's not.

59
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,840
Whatever the hell's going on out there, she's been stabbed.

60
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,059
Come on, man. You're an astronaut. You should know what to do.

61
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,539
If we don't get her to a hospital, she's going to die. There are no more hospitals.

62
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:08,470
Hospitals. You got, uh, doctors. You got tri-i's. You got a mass unit.

63
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,190
Oh, look, I'm just a grad student, okay? I, I got volunteered to do this.

64
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:19,860
Just an astronaut. That's the, that's the party store astronaut costume.

65
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,080
That's the guy that comes to the party in the astronaut costume that was like

66
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,200
$14 at the party store. He's smoking a joint and he like takes the helmet off and he's like,

67
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,759
Oh, I'm ready to hit the moon. All right. I'm going to play.

68
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,740
Chopper's coming down. Big ring.

69
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:38,360
This man coming.

70
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,340
25 captain crunch box top to get this. Make sure you bring it back in one piece.

71
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,860
Okay. Let me put the subtitles on.

72
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:53,799
It was plenty of space in the helicopter. Hello? Anytime a game spends this, I think the

73
00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:04,539
game's hung up. Like it's hanging. It's pretty much what I was going for in dreams the other

74
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:11,879
day. Did they did a kind of a better job than I did, but you know, he can't be perfect.

75
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:24,379
Freaker is all dead. Zombies are called Freakers. Sounds like he's YouTube sub

76
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:37,320
community. Uh, plus one letter grade.

77
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,480
Can't be far. Wait, hold on. Cut your engine.

78
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:52,279
Shit, she's alive. Alvarez. Alvarez. Hey, Alvarez. What happened here? I mean,

79
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,899
who did this? Was it, was it Rippers? No, his community is really nice. It wasn't

80
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:28,019
Rip Van Winkle 22. It was Freaker. Freaker HD 1080p. Here we go. Gameplay.

81
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:35,720
Chase down Leon. How do I, how do I drive? They didn't tell me how to drive. X to

82
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:47,450
boost. It's actually kind of hard to drive this. How many boosts do I get? Oh,

83
00:14:47,450 --> 00:15:01,320
it's the rumors versus the zoomers. Just drive through the fire. It doesn't even matter.

84
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:20,460
Look, I'm going too slow. Subtitles, subtitles, subtitles. All right. All right.

85
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:27,100
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Display. Why can I not turn this on? Why would you have

86
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:39,750
this setting here? This is probably PS4 Pro only. Language. Subtitles. There,

87
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:58,759
I turned them on. Derma, come to Brazil.

88
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:25,240
65 mile per hour on this road. He lays his bike down. When landing, you can

89
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,440
reduce bike damage by using L to angle your tires parallel to the ground. Give me the

90
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,120
next tip. If you drift while turning, you can slide through corners and even do donuts.

91
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:45,220
Give the next one while on the bike. Watch the gas tank right behind you.

92
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,370
How do you cover somebody with a shotgun from that far away? You may as well just

93
00:16:51,370 --> 00:17:12,259
shoot it in the air. We'll make it quick. Tracking. Press R3 to activate survival vision,

94
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:15,140
which will reveal clues and other information about your surroundings.

95
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:26,460
Does every game have to have this? I'm sorry. Like I'm going to have to take a

96
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:33,660
second here to explain. What? Why does every fucking AAA game have a spider sense? Why?

97
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:46,420
What is causing this guy to have this? Every game is Batman. Yeah, but like why?

98
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,740
What's like the story purpose for him to be able to see through walls?

99
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:59,819
Tracking. While using survival vision, your DualShock 4 wireless controller will vibrate.

100
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:04,890
I turned off vibrate. When your camera is facing a clue, depending on your distance to

101
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,369
it, vibrations will increase or decrease. But I turned them off.

102
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:30,019
Okay. Do I seriously have to turn on the vibration? No. What? They're behind us.

103
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:42,089
I don't need the vibration. I'll just look. Wait, wait, wait. Here. Down this way. Wait,

104
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:50,549
I can see into the past? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I touched the blood. Therefore,

105
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:55,640
now I can see the past. Wait, there's a Dark Souls blood stain here. Let me see what

106
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:06,579
happened. Watch out. Watch out. He died by something over here. What did he die by?

107
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,859
I have no idea. He fell and died. I think he was doing the meme where he jumped off

108
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:40,579
the top to die and made sure he had the blood. This blips on the map. Can I like investigate?

109
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:51,130
How do I take out the gun? No, it doesn't say boomer.

110
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:59,769
Balls. He's losing a lot of blood. Press X to hop over parkour style.

111
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:12,279
I mean, the environments look pretty cool. Who shot him? Did I shoot him?

112
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,829
Leading out. That's a hell of a way to go. It's slow. A lot of pain,

113
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,630
but I suppose you know him about that. She was still breathing when we found her,

114
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,349
you piece of shit. I wasn't going to waste a bullet not on her.

115
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,500
I don't know for a second. I don't know for a second now. Where's the stash?

116
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:44,500
Boss, don't look like you've been sleeping for too long. Leon, he got a little problem.

117
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,700
Why would you do that? I can smell your blood. Now they'll smell me because I'm stupid enough

118
00:20:50,700 --> 00:21:04,599
to put my hands on it. No, wait. All right. All right. I got it right here. Take it.

119
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,079
He smears blood all over it with his hands.

120
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:20,970
Is he a bad guy? We're the bad guy in this story.

121
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:36,970
Do it. Do it. Do it. Fulfill your destiny.

122
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:47,450
Holy fall. Oh my God, he actually did it. Welcome to the dark side. Hey, uh.

123
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,890
Tuck's going to need something for the bounty.

124
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:15,400
I didn't even have time to make him a mask. Oh, no. Oh, God. I'm not putting the pressure.

125
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,119
I had six months to come up with Darth Vader. You are, uh,

126
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,220
Hey, hold up. I want to search this camp. See if I can't find something.

127
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:45,099
That's terrible. Make something out of this. Oh, scraps. Fine materials to craft. Crafting.

128
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:53,690
What? Are you telling me that there's a whole entire fucking crafting system?

129
00:22:54,569 --> 00:23:12,309
Let me use my boomer vision. Come on. I can't like fail to pick stuff up off the ground

130
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:40,099
tutorial. We'll make it quick. Um, will you? Are you sure? Where? I seriously need to turn

131
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:47,700
on vibrations, don't I? God damn it. I hate vibrations. It makes me feel like ill.

132
00:23:48,420 --> 00:24:10,069
I didn't even help. Um, are you like, are you my dog? Are you pointing in the right

133
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:19,930
direction here? It vibrates like you're on a hog. There's a dead guy in there.

134
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:47,980
Sleeping bag? No, it's not the sleeping bag. All right. Where is this?

135
00:24:48,779 --> 00:25:09,529
Uh, so I'm serious. Where the fuck is this? That shit? What? There wasn't even an indicator.

136
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:19,700
All right. Why was there an indicator for the first one and no indicator for the second one?

137
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:27,420
There was no square on the screen. All right. He's R to expand the medical category.

138
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:38,440
Hold R1 to craft a bandage. How many can I make? He's gone. No, that didn't. What?

139
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,690
All right. Let's use the bandage. So you can go on the wheel. Just hold R2.

140
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:56,420
Okay, it's got a fucking wheel. We're really ticking all the AAA video game boxes, aren't we?

141
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Sprinting and rolling depletes your stamina. If you run out, you need to wait for it to

142
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,599
recover. At first I thought that said you need to drink water. I was about to say no,

143
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:32,150
don't make me do that. Died to loot wheel.

144
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:47,660
Son of a bitch. Step back, step back. Just piss yourself. Fuel pump. Yeah,

145
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,339
shot out my damn fuel pump. Can we get anything out of Leon? Get away from that.

146
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:56,549
It's done. Let's just go back to O'Leary Mountain. All it takes is a guy with a

147
00:26:56,549 --> 00:27:16,339
cigar in his mouth and you're done. Fight this? Far from here. Let's just head over there.

148
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,619
What are you thinking? We were going out hunting tonight anyway.

149
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,329
What's it really like? It's as good a place as any.

150
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:37,319
Okay. Oh, we're doing. Oh, we're doing bunk beds. Nice. Hey, what did Leon give you?

151
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,009
Map of some kind. Once we get my bike back, let's head up to the cemetery. Look around.

152
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:55,029
Yeah, I have no control. I just have to hold on. So tomorrow get the drugs, take him to Tucker,

153
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,710
collect on Leon's bounty. Then I say we head north. Do you think shit's any different?

154
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:06,220
I say we head south. So we have a little bit. That just scared the fuck out of me.

155
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,299
What the fuck would you do? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

156
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,910
Why did this just come up? What's going on? Hold on. You went too fast here.

157
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:25,190
Swipe left. Did I press that? I mean, maybe I pressed it. Swipe left. Can I go back?

158
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,099
Swipe left or press R1 to view inventory and get info on gear,

159
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:37,980
crafting supplies. Okay. Storylines menu. Swipe up or press R1 to view. Swipe up.

160
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:50,779
So it's swiping. So we got skills. Okay. Did I level up or something? No, it requires a skill

161
00:28:50,779 --> 00:29:10,730
point. Jesus Christ. What's happening? This is scaring me. Oh, it's all. Oh, that's what's

162
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:17,049
happening. If you touch the, if you touch the pad here on the PS4, it opens the menu.

163
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:25,700
Oh, I'm going to scream about this later. I'm going to be in the middle of a fight and I'm

164
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,660
going to fucking like move my thumb and touch it and it's going to open and I'm going to

165
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:37,849
scream. Move the truck with our bare hands? Pushing vehicles. Some vehicles can be moved to

166
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:49,740
clear a block pass. Hold. Swear to push them. Put tape on your controller. I thought someone

167
00:29:49,740 --> 00:30:05,339
was driving. I don't know how this happened. I got stuck in the snow. Hey. What? Oh,

168
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:13,269
he wanted to punch him. He wanted to punch that guy. He didn't, he wasn't even aiming for me.

169
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:24,730
What? Why? Why? Hold L in any enemy's direction and press R2.

170
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,779
Choose direction and then tap R1 to roll.

171
00:30:30,420 --> 00:31:01,880
I just slit everybody's throats. Oh, okay. Anybody have any loot on them? Wow. Jake,

172
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,019
you're a real psycho. I don't know what it is, man. I have to slit their throats.

173
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:20,180
No loot? Yeah, what's up with that? Coming up on the old Nero checkpoint.

174
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,150
Dude, the best trope in all of media is definitely you punched a guy in the face you

175
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,710
weren't supposed to punch in the face. Imagine like you punched your friend directly in his face

176
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,029
as hard as you could because somebody ducked slowly.

177
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,220
That would cause, that would be ripple effects for what that happened there

178
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:58,420
for 10 years. You would never trust each other. There'd be a falling out

179
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,019
months and weeks later. It would never, it would change your friendship forever.

180
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,990
Yeah. Okay, go through the tunnel.

181
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:28,980
Can we siphon some of the gas from these cars? That would be a real survival game.

182
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:35,109
No, we just walked 10 feet for another cutscene. Why not just have the cutscene go through here?

183
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:53,589
Clip this. Somebody show the clip. Do it. I know somebody has that one. Do it. No,

184
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:57,349
not the slap. I'm talking about the puke. Why? Why would you do this?

185
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:26,789
Two fucking enemies. What is this game? Can I play? I got to shoot twice.

186
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,869
They could have done all this in one cutscene and then like just teach me how to shoot

187
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:43,269
in two minutes. Oh, you're never going to get this day back. You're never getting these days back,

188
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:54,460
Jeremy. These guys are on the map. I'm being too harsh. They need to like teach people how to

189
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:07,960
play. Do I have to get on his bike? I can't like, there's no more enemies or anything. I'd

190
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,860
have to get on the bike. He's just following me. Okay, if there's another cutscene here,

191
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,079
I'm going to be very, very, no, wait, are you actually just following me on the bike?

192
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:46,139
I can't get on the bike. Oh god. Why don't we just ride through? Oh, there is loot. Oh shit,

193
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,940
we can turn this off. I've played Left 4 Dead before. Can we steal something from her?

194
00:34:49,500 --> 00:35:04,179
You know anything about cars? Plus one scrap. Oh no, you unplugged the car from the outlet.

195
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,989
How many bolts do I have?

196
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:13,050
You're not getting your bike through there. Try that service tunnel. See if you can clear us a

197
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,130
path from the other side. I got it. Just keep your headlight pointed that way.

198
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:22,250
Keep your head, please keep your headlight pointed at the objective because I,

199
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,340
I would have missed it and I actually would have. I went too far up. Wait,

200
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:34,840
hold on. This game probably has like secrets. I shouldn't just be running through as fast

201
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:47,860
as I can. Whoa, scary. Am I gonna have a fist fight with a zombie? Oh, that would have been

202
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,369
so fucking funny. You redeem this entire first like 30-40 minutes of the game if me and that

203
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:58,260
zombie have a fist fight. He like punches me in the face like three or four times because

204
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:06,920
he hands up like a boxer. Where's the flashlight coming from? Um, I think my eyes.

205
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:23,340
Where's the flashlight coming from? No, it's just a spotlight. Oh fuck, I was talking a

206
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,420
lot of shit. He does have superpowers. I'm sorry. I retract everything I said. Never mind.

207
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:51,260
Every biker has, has what? Light eyes? Oops. Come on, get in here quick. We're gonna get

208
00:36:51,260 --> 00:37:18,980
out of here. Let's go. No, let me shoot him. Shoot. Shoot him. He doesn't give a shit. He

209
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:28,329
doesn't care if I live or die. He was pretending to help. That backwards side gun hold was just

210
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:36,280
like, ah, whatever. I'll find another friend. There's a double. Is there a zoom in feature?

211
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:45,659
They're blocking the bullets? He wasn't actually trying to block the bullets,

212
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:55,739
was he? His hands? I don't have any bullets left. Did I fail this tutorial?

213
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:12,679
Another nest. Knife. Yeah, that's right. I have a knife. How many molotovs you got left?

214
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:17,690
Oh, we're gonna teach men to throw molotovs. Just use the last one. You got any shit to make

215
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:36,650
more? Burn the freaker nest. Okay, well, give them to me. You got any shit to make more.

216
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:46,139
This will just take a sec. All right, throwables category. There's rocks. Okay, so, I mean,

217
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:55,340
there are rocks. With the molotov equipped, hold L2 and aim, tap R2 to throw. All right,

218
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:03,750
there's the nest right there. I don't have any bullets. I don't have any bullets.

219
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:27,750
No, I want to like, what are they doing? Oh, he got him. It's like more fun to dodge

220
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:38,039
around than it is to do anything else. Round one of zombies. All right, get us out of here.

221
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,900
Yeah, I'm collecting their ears for some crazy reason.

222
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:03,000
25. From 65 to 25. Sounds about right.

223
00:40:10,219 --> 00:40:20,010
Got any more molotovs? Oh, I have an idea. Hey, you just scream as loud as you can over

224
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,820
here off the bike and wait till they all run over to you and then I'll leave.

225
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,340
Wow.

226
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,340
That's actually what we're doing. That's the real plan.

227
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:02,980
All right. He didn't leave the bike though. He's gonna pull them and I have to get to the

228
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:11,260
garage. I would laugh if he just crashed and flew up. I don't have any bullets though.

229
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,139
I'm gonna have to really play tactically. You got a death wish. Find crazy Willy's garage.

230
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,909
Newts. Newts are skittish and usually stick to out of reach places like rooftops. They will

231
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:32,789
attack if they sense you are low on health or if you invade their turf.

232
00:41:45,219 --> 00:42:12,650
Oh, I'm invading their turf. Get away from me! What? What? They're like zombies. They're

233
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:23,739
like aliens. All right, hold on. So what on the screen here is... I didn't even hurt anybody.

234
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:35,659
All right, so we have to get into the garage. Bushes. Provide cover for stealth if you haven't

235
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:39,260
been spotted. Remain crouched with circle to stay hidden and use rocks to create distractions.

236
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,059
I didn't even need to use the... He didn't see me. I technically did it in stealth.

237
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:33,500
Oh, shit! All right, you got a guy right there. I'm gonna actually do the rest in

238
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,929
stealth. I'm gonna play this like a true video game. Watch this. Ready? Well, it takes the

239
00:43:41,929 --> 00:44:19,030
gun out immediately. I just want rocks. Did you see me? Can you see me? This is actually fun.

240
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:36,199
This is a fun game. No ammo. What? Oh, you have... I gotta stop fucking around.

241
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:59,079
There's ammo in the game. Nice dodge. Holy shit. Okay, so there's a guy in here. Wait.

242
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:07,269
All right, no more fucking around. Let's actually do this correctly.

243
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:23,849
Would the buddy go? Yeah, that's true. Where is he? He was riding around out here.

244
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:49,940
Gas can? Gas cans can be used to refuel your bike and generator. Is it...

245
00:45:50,579 --> 00:46:07,619
Wait, I can throw? Can I just pour it out? Holy shit! Drink the gas. Spark plug?

246
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:13,849
Silence your guns by attaching a suppressor. Select a compatible gun of the survival

247
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:21,300
weapon. Press R1 to attach it. Did I get a suppressor from the car? That's a little odd.

248
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:44,630
It was R1, right? R1? R1. Is that not... Am I not doing this right? Yeah, R1. R1. I don't

249
00:46:44,630 --> 00:47:08,570
know. I'm gonna blow that up. You know I'm gonna. Oh! Yes! I need to try. No, no. I want to hit...

250
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:23,849
I want to swing at it. I got a sick... a stick. Wait, hold on. I want to look around. What's in

251
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:33,000
here? A spark plug? Maybe I don't have enough materials. All right, there's something over here.

252
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,739
Explosive objects will blow up and damage by bullets or other explosives.

253
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:47,539
So I can't, like, do anything with this. This... No, that's gonna explode. This is an

254
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:51,539
explosive. I'm holding an explosive. If I throw an explosive at an explosive, it's at explosives.

255
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:59,449
So I'm not gonna do that. All right, let's just get in here. What do you mean? Yes, you can.

256
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:16,039
Not real. Okay, see? It's plastic versus metal. It's not explosive. It's what's inside that

257
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:34,699
matters. Break it with a knife. Okay, we gotta get in there somehow. Up on the roof.

258
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:50,139
Let's use our boomer vision. Shoot it. I don't have any bullets. I'm out of bullets. Baseball

259
00:48:50,139 --> 00:49:07,269
bat. Damage and durability. Oh, I want the bat. I love baseball bats. Can I throw stuff?

260
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:30,789
Can I throw the bat? Imagine if it went through the can and exploded. All right,

261
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:37,369
we got any more freakers? I don't think so. I need to bring this with me, though.

262
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:52,179
I might need it. I don't see any more freakers. No more trunks. This is just open.

263
00:49:52,980 --> 00:50:02,329
Oh, another gas. No, I don't want that. Battery, though. Battery. Take the battery.

264
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:23,750
I'm not gonna drink the gas. It'll be a sidearm suppressor. It'll give you energy. I don't think

265
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:37,619
I... Why am I carrying? Do I need to take this somewhere? Can I have... Can I hold two? No.

266
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:46,500
Which one has more in it? I'll take this one. Well, there's just a bunch of shit in here.

267
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:59,340
Rag. Drink the bat. No, I gotta do something cool with this. I'm not drinking the gasoline.

268
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,920
I'm gonna blow the gasoline. I wish I could just dump the gasoline. All right, that's fine.

269
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,789
Let's just get out of here and head into the back way of the garage. Here we go.

270
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:23,619
Board it up. Well, oh, never mind. We're going this way. I can't jump. Is there a way to go all the

271
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:42,219
way around? Like, up there? I can't go... Wait. Am I maybe, like... Can I jump on these? Well,

272
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:46,860
I have to go across there. So how do I get up there? Is it the tree? Do I have to jump from

273
00:51:46,860 --> 00:52:24,139
the tree? I don't see a ladder. You'd think there would be a ladder out here. I don't see

274
00:52:24,219 --> 00:52:42,699
a ladder. Well, do I push the car over here? Can I, like, shove the car over?

275
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:56,380
Can I just go into edit mode? Well, it looks like I'm going over here. Can I, like... No,

276
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:28,219
don't go in the dumpster. I want to, like, climb the dumpster. Well, okay. Can I go up?

277
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:53,900
Compelling climb to trash gameplay. Do I just need to shoot the lock? No, I don't. Look,

278
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:01,000
they're making me go, like, all the way. Do I have to shoot the lock? No, no, no, no, no, no.

279
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:15,769
They wouldn't do that. They wouldn't make me do that. I don't have any bullets. I need a

280
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:28,070
different gun. I have no bullets. I can't even, like, attempt to do that. Pour gas on the lock.

281
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:46,630
All right. Well, I'm... Let's try, I guess, go to the left and climb up. But from where?

282
00:54:48,630 --> 00:55:10,940
Like, over here? There's, like, nothing over here. Is it up this? Do I actually have to just jump on

283
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:40,409
this thing? All right. I didn't... That was... I had to do that. They were coming after me.

284
00:55:40,409 --> 00:55:50,980
All right, so let me get in here now. Is there, like, a hatch I can pull? Can I, like, move,

285
00:55:50,980 --> 00:56:09,780
break something, move something? I mean, all right, yeah. So, I'm sorry I didn't know

286
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:17,880
that. I'm looking for a ladder. This one, like, little gray shed that's sitting on the side.

287
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:38,650
That's the only place you can get up. All right, let's get some cash out of the ATM,

288
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:50,010
I think. Fucking money's worthless. Don't worry. I still got plenty of gold. All right,

289
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:56,659
what else is in here? Nothing. Nothing. Let's unlock the... First of all, let's get the

290
00:56:56,659 --> 00:57:13,239
shortcut open. That's important. Anything in the toilets? No. Yes, there is. Elevator next

291
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:29,289
to Firelink. No, what? Find the fuel pump. Was it in this room right here?

292
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:48,280
No, I found the fuel pump. Dude, how long have you been in there for?

293
00:57:49,320 --> 00:58:00,579
There's 400 chasing me. I'm out of gas. You've been in there for an hour and a half, man.

294
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:08,039
Hey, Boozman, I'm sorry. There was one shed that I had to climb up and I couldn't figure

295
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:24,230
it out. I needed a bunch of friends to help me find it. What are you fucking stupid? A couple

296
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:32,170
thousand friends. Wait, what did I just do? Max. All right, I have too many of these. I gotta

297
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:49,699
craft some stuff. Hold on. Can I craft ammo? It's refined metal. All right, let's go find

298
00:58:49,699 --> 00:59:06,230
Boomer. Hold on. Hang on, Boozman. I'm coming. What was my gas tank? Oh, he's up there.

299
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:14,070
He's just doing donuts up there. Is he really just like spinning around in circles?

300
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:26,199
You took way too long. Blind. Streamers blind. He did this to me.

301
00:59:48,840 --> 01:00:02,360
What the hell? How? Get low. Get low. Is that a song?

302
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:12,230
I've been singing a song. You can enter cover by crouching next to it. Press circle to toggle

303
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:20,739
crouch. So those are rippers. Shoulder swapping. While aiming L2, press X to shoulder swap.

304
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:56,250
Let me make a couple things here. Let me just start crafting.

305
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:59,510
Sons of bitches, get off of them!

306
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,909
I was trying to hit him in the head with a rock. That may have been a mistake.

307
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:35,159
I was trying to throw a rock at my friend's head.

308
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:50,900
What's with the crowd?

309
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:03,940
It's us.

310
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:11,059
Yeah, there they are. I needed like three or four thousand of them to figure out what to do.

311
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:20,920
Streamer sucks, game sucks. Idiot blind. That's what they're all screaming.

312
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:51,179
He can't possibly be this bad. Next. He can't reach it. He's not pretending.

313
01:02:54,699 --> 01:03:08,280
Hey dude, you all right? You okay? All right, here we go. Welcome to the game.

314
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:22,329
Don't you wait out here. Make sure it's all clear. Screw that. There's a bunk calling my name.

315
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:34,300
This guy's all fucked up. Like there's much to steal. I'm just gonna reintroduce myself.

316
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:43,400
This is ride to hell retribution with zombies in place of the so bad it's good factor.

317
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:52,070
I mean, I can't make that assessment yet.

318
01:03:52,869 --> 01:04:02,940
Oh, it's still light up. Hey, I've got some ammo if you need it in the footlocker by the door.

319
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:10,039
Thanks. Can we just dump hydrogen peroxide all over you? You're making me itch.

320
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:21,019
Thanks brother. Just feel kind of naked without it.

321
01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:34,699
All right, so director is on the mountain. Six percent he's my brother.

322
01:04:34,699 --> 01:04:40,550
I'm six percent of the way through the story. New items.

323
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:50,150
Primary. Sidearms. Special. Primary. Nothing. Sidearms. Nine millimeter with the can on it.

324
01:04:50,869 --> 01:05:00,119
Okay. Crossbow. Good in stealth situations. Its versatility goes up. The more bolts you can

325
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:16,280
craft, the crossbow has a longer reload time. All right, let's put it on. Drifters on the

326
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,360
mountain. Return to your bike. Hold on. So this is where I store my weapons and items and

327
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:39,900
stuff. What else is in here? A bunch of ammo. Why do I even have the shot? I want to like

328
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,340
reload that. It's one of those things where I have to walk out and then reload.

329
01:05:45,159 --> 01:05:56,460
No, it's locked. See, there we go. Okay, now reload the damn gun. Reload them all.

330
01:05:57,019 --> 01:06:06,780
And now take the ammo because I can take more ammo, right? Or no. Well, whatever.

331
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,940
I thought I was going to be able to load the gun and take more ammo.

332
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:15,139
Pick this one. Now what's this?

333
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:23,139
Maneuver quickly through the safe house gate to avoid letting enemies in.

334
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:29,079
People can just come in. Heal. Oh, you actually, okay. Thankfully you can just press this

335
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:36,019
button. So that's fully heal. Anything else in here I need to do or can see?

336
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:49,849
It's just ammo, all right. Crafting bench or something. That's a bat. I'll take it. All

337
01:06:49,849 --> 01:07:05,929
right. Well, let's go. I can't just drive my bike. I can't drive his bike to my bike and somebody

338
01:07:05,929 --> 01:07:12,780
will get it. You can now create a new crossbow boat by crafting them. Cedar saplings provide

339
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:17,739
the wood and scrap makes the tip. Combine the two in the survival wheel. All right, so I need

340
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:31,960
saplings and scrap to make bolts. Makes sense. I can't even

341
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:57,000
do that. Follow mission. Crossbow bolts are affected by gravity and will drop as they

342
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,650
travel to the target. When shooting at something far away, aim higher. I gotta follow this guy.

343
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,840
We just have to run behind him. All right, he's in the base. He made it to like the

344
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:24,100
fallout base. Clear the Marauder camp. You got it. Target the binoculars with up and press

345
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,119
R2 to mark. Marking enemies makes it easier to follow their movements.

346
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:39,220
Tracked human enemies will display their awareness levels. All right, let's just do it.

347
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:49,979
How do I zoom in? L3 is zoom. Well, L3 is zoom. Okay, I'm walking towards them with

348
01:08:49,979 --> 01:09:00,069
binoculars. I saw L3. Technically, this is zooming in. It's just walking forward.

349
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:43,020
Where are the others? That guy's alive? All right, where's the rest of them?

350
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:06,170
I think I saw something. Yeah, well, you may have. Stool leg? No, my, the weapon I had was

351
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:27,989
better. Pistol ammo. Do they have an indicator over here? Wait, is some?

352
01:10:27,989 --> 01:11:21,899
That's a bird. Speaking of a head. Well, neither are you.

353
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:26,439
Regaining stealth. If you've been spotted by an enemy, get out of their line of sight

354
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:45,689
and hide. They'll eventually give up the search. Really. I'm trying to backstab her.

355
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:56,220
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me check around.

356
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,779
She was walking up backwards.

357
01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:09,020
Nothing else.

358
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:27,479
Free shit. It's fucked up that you're killing their entire family for no reason.

359
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:41,909
Well, it's not for no reason. It's to survive. I missed a rifle. Wait, there's a rifle? Am I

360
01:12:41,909 --> 01:12:55,560
getting baited? I don't know if I believe that. Bad weather can affect enemy's ability

361
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,359
to see and hear. It can also affect the conditions of trails and roads. All right,

362
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:03,829
damn freakers. Swimmers are sensitive to light, feeding mostly at night or during heavy storms.

363
01:13:03,829 --> 01:13:25,260
Taking on more than one is death or something. It's not worth it. Will they have anything

364
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:55,770
good? I might be able to get a stealth hold on. Got him! There's only one more.

365
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:24,949
He's telling me to run. Why would I run? There's only one.

366
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:40,460
It's raining all the time. All the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain.

367
01:14:41,579 --> 01:14:52,279
Oh shit. Somebody's right here. Oh fuck, there is somebody right there. What about the rock?

368
01:14:52,279 --> 01:15:03,060
Go to the rock first. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell just happened? That was

369
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:11,930
weird. Does he know I'm here? What is he doing? Oh my god, he's doing the golem. This

370
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:36,579
is bad. I think I have to... durability meter, melee weapons found on the field, break easily.

371
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:41,079
Pay attention to the durability meter. If there's a blinking red icon, there are only a few hits left

372
01:15:41,079 --> 01:16:05,800
before it breaks. Oh, I still got a knife. Okay, slide. Stay down. Give me my bike back

373
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:13,060
so we can continue playing the game. All right, there's still two here. Give me the rock.

374
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:23,369
You know, you go that way. Melee stealth kill you?

375
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:44,310
Car. Always check the cars. There's a camp right here. Nothing in the boomer vision.

376
01:16:45,029 --> 01:16:53,670
I need to stop calling it that. Somebody see me? You want to hear me? Rifle over here,

377
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:59,899
rifle over here. What's this clip? Why is everybody clipping this? Oh wait, I can't watch

378
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:15,699
that. Did I? Who cares about the rifle? Turn around. You and then you. Am I getting

379
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:25,670
experience for this? There's exp in this game, right? Wow! He just dodged it.

380
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:40,710
No. Melee in this game feels very good. To the point where you could just melee everybody.

381
01:17:43,029 --> 01:17:51,579
Everyone. You can just melee anyone. Maybe that's just the initial enemy.

382
01:17:52,220 --> 01:18:06,100
This is it. This is where we left it. All right, so give me my bike and let's move on.

383
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:17,109
Somebody stole the bike. I have to keep going. My bike's gone. What a waste of 500 million

384
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:22,069
dollars. I don't think it cost that much to make this game. I think it was more like,

385
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:30,439
it was probably like 40 million. What?

386
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:53,800
You can't shoot him. It was aiming around him. Let's see if I can get one rock throw.

387
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,300
Why would this guy be over here? There's no reason for this guy to be hiding here.

388
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:11,899
Just waiting for me to come know that my bike is stolen. He's standing behind the car.

389
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:36,939
That was a huge underhanded throw. Nobody can throw that far underhand. No overhead throws?

390
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:52,460
That's kind of ridiculous. It's me! Open up! He's here! He's here! That's right I am.

391
01:19:54,569 --> 01:20:10,810
Fuck no! I didn't mean to do that. They don't really care. Now he throws it overhand.

392
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:20,710
Should I just shoot this guy? Let me like make the- hold on. Let's- can I craft- to

393
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:24,470
craft bullets, right? I don't think I can craft anything. Bolt. They don't have enough.

394
01:20:25,109 --> 01:20:31,500
I need cedar sapling. Well we're just gonna have to shoot people.

395
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:53,109
This is- I just- we just go walk in. Yeah that's where I'm headed.

396
01:20:53,829 --> 01:20:57,369
So it's just a town. Okay. I thought this was a

397
01:20:58,170 --> 01:21:02,569
bandit camp. I was supposed to go in here and just start shooting people.

398
01:21:03,289 --> 01:21:08,069
All right here's the kitchen. I'm like trying to plan how to go in

399
01:21:08,789 --> 01:21:13,590
and kill people. Meeting plans can be collected and turned into encampment

400
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:17,189
kitchens for trust and credits. Different types of meat and plants provide different rewards.

401
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:23,189
Why does somebody always call me at the worst possible moment? Why do you have to call me?

402
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:35,340
Okay. Are there animals in this game? I mean I guess I saw the elk but there's tigers and

403
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:49,350
like bears and shit. Okay. Bounties. Freaker ears can be collected and turned into encampment

404
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:54,140
bounty clicks for trust and credits. Different freakers have different rewards. All right so

405
01:21:54,140 --> 01:22:02,149
I can just turn these in for money. Swarmer ear, newt ear. I guess we can just sell them right?

406
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,739
Is there any reason to not do that?

407
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:18,760
Merchant.

408
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,630
You ever read it? No. That book doesn't exist man.

409
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:47,050
Ran a shop. Farewell. Made all the grease monkeys read it. Being a mechanic requires great peace

410
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:51,850
of mind. That's it. If I'm working on an empty stomach, that'll focus your mind. Man,

411
01:22:51,850 --> 01:23:02,090
I'm looking for a bike. But yeah. Oh, hold on. I want that one. It just came off the truck.

412
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:05,689
Some dumb son of a bitch left it out in the shit. Busted up good.

413
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,130
It was me that did that. Okay. Fooled the road. It didn't be shit about bikes.

414
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:17,140
Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Shot the hell out of this one. Partyed it out. It didn't even

415
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:24,020
have a fuel pump. We could have used that man. Fuel pump like this one. Okay. Like this one

416
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:32,020
man. Okay. Okay. See now when I said fool, what I meant was the fools that brought that

417
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:38,180
bike in. See they didn't even tie that shit down properly. So they were like rattling around

418
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,989
back then. You were right about not getting this day back. It's all right. We're just

419
01:23:45,989 --> 01:24:10,939
enjoying a new game. All right. What's with the big explosion meter?

420
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:19,899
Is this guy flammable? Oh no, I think that that's just the indicator for the quest.

421
01:24:19,899 --> 01:24:40,659
I thought this guy was flammable. I can't skip the optional dialogue because when I touch

422
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:47,060
the, when I touch the thing. Yes, I can. No, I'm not skipping it. Is that people? Come on.

423
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:20,170
I'm not bored. I'm not bored yet. I'm not bored.

424
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:32,470
Tell you what. You find yourself bored. Bring it to me. Just wait till I get on the car.

425
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:40,420
We'll see what we can do for you. I want one of your chapsticks. The bike. You have two of them.

426
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:55,699
That your men stole. Salvage. Salvage. Oh wait, nice hat. What? Oh this one. Don't you ever

427
01:25:55,699 --> 01:26:04,729
touch it. Hold on. Leon wore a hat like this, didn't he? I swear to god. Don't. Do business in

428
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:18,550
my camp. Is it weird that I feel like somebody sneezed this story into my head last night?

429
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:32,579
That's all I like. The only way I can describe it is there was a storyline that somebody just

430
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:37,939
like fucking opened up my head just with a buzz saw pulled back my skull and like took

431
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:43,140
and just covered it up and then shook my head and woke me back up. And I was like, oh,

432
01:26:43,140 --> 01:27:01,699
okay. I think I know. I mean, I'm not really paying too much attention. I mean, I am,

433
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:18,180
but I guess there's only so much you can. Can we talk? Can't even talk? Why can I not talk?

434
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:29,689
I can't believe there's no talk button. All right, let me go to the, hold on. Before

435
01:27:29,689 --> 01:27:37,449
I let go anywhere. Where's that merchant? I'll let you buy shit. Yeah, they sell guns,

436
01:27:37,449 --> 01:27:42,949
ammo, and supplies. If you have enough credits of trust, you can buy shit. So,

437
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:51,770
ammo, pistol ammo. How much do I have? 143? Let me buy ammo. Upgrades, presser, health,

438
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:58,840
med kit. Oh, grenades. I can't get them though. Locker. Oh, you can go into your locker.

439
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,829
Okay. All right, look.

440
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:12,300
Hold up. I just want to say how sorry I am. I didn't know. I swear. You have any idea

441
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:17,579
how much time I put into that bike. It was a drifter bike, Manny. I know. I know.

442
01:28:18,539 --> 01:28:25,109
I'll make it up. I put together a new one. Oh, this piece of shit, a bike.

443
01:28:26,149 --> 01:28:33,109
I know it's not. Look, I'll keep an eye out for more parts. I'll hook you up. I swear.

444
01:28:33,109 --> 01:28:37,109
Okay. What about my custom gas tank, Manny? You know, the one that I got for my dead wife.

445
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:41,750
You're going to keep an eye out for that one too? Jesus. I'm sorry. Let's get the fuck out

446
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:53,060
of my way. I did it. 100% of the game. Plus a thousand trust gear. There we go. I can't

447
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:57,140
wait to be doing that. Me and Boozer can't ride north till I fix up this bike. Get some better

448
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:08,579
gear. Give me this bike. Finally. Ride to the Nero checkpoint. Let's go. Let's go.

449
01:29:09,699 --> 01:29:37,689
It's a bad game. I mean, we can't, we can't, I can't bump into somebody like that.

450
01:29:39,109 --> 01:29:41,670
Drift. All right. So R2 and then circle.

451
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:03,619
Can you fall off the bike?

452
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:13,989
Whatever. No third degree burns. You stay there. You rest. Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

453
01:30:13,989 --> 01:30:27,109
I'm here. I don't know what way to find out. I guess I made it. I guess, I guess I'll see what

454
01:30:27,109 --> 01:30:32,970
I can find. This is it. The Nero checkpoint. I got to find some shit for boosers.

455
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:43,319
Oh, you can't. All right. Games, not the games. All right.

456
01:30:49,479 --> 01:31:05,210
Why even fight them? Just run into them. Quick save. T-pad. Do I have the code? I gotta

457
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:11,369
find the code. Okay. Uh, restore power to the Nero mobile medical unit.

458
01:31:23,659 --> 01:31:29,260
No, I was trying to, what? I was trying to, never mind. You know what I was trying to do.

459
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:51,829
That's, oh, that's, I told you I was gonna hate it. I told you I was gonna not like

460
01:31:51,909 --> 01:31:59,189
that mechanic. I was gonna, my thumb was gonna touch it. It won't start. It needs gas.

461
01:32:01,109 --> 01:32:18,310
I can get gas. I know where gas is. Just find a can. Saving game at the bike. Yes.

462
01:32:19,029 --> 01:32:29,260
I know about saving the game at the bike. I figured it out. Can. I just need a gas can.

463
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:40,899
Dude, I just love scavenging. This gives me flashbacks to when I played The Surge.

464
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:46,359
Well, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there for one reason. Because when I played

465
01:32:46,359 --> 01:32:54,619
The Surge, I was insufferably angry at the game. I hated every second of that game. So, I mean,

466
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:05,989
I'm not like angry right now. I'm just kind of bewilderment to try to figure out if I like

467
01:33:05,989 --> 01:33:14,649
it or not, you know. Bewilderment is the good way to describe this. Give me this stuff.

468
01:33:16,539 --> 01:33:30,229
Beer bottle rag. Can I make this jump? You don't like it. Just get over it. That's not

469
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:38,010
true yet. Hold on. You gotta give me like a... What did I just do that for? Just give me like

470
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:43,539
another 30 minutes to tell you about my initial assessment of the game. All right,

471
01:33:43,539 --> 01:33:51,960
we're gonna get gas. Probably over there. Can I just take it out of the bike?

472
01:33:52,600 --> 01:34:05,100
Can I put a hose in and just like suck the back of it? Found it. That's as far as you

473
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:10,170
can throw. I need 20 hours for my initial thoughts. No, no. I just need like a few.

474
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:25,930
We haven't even seen anything yet. All we've seen is... Who's this?

475
01:34:26,409 --> 01:34:54,890
That's gonna bring them all down on me. But where are they? Right when I get out, really.

476
01:34:56,949 --> 01:35:16,539
Oh god. I need bandages. Can I stealth by? I probably can. Okay. I gotta like get in there.

477
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:23,479
I don't want to go in the front door. Speakers! Where the hell are the speakers?

478
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:30,380
I don't feel in danger right now. There's two people. How would they keep their shit?

479
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:33,180
If there were like a hundred people chasing me right now, I'd be like, oh no!

480
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:44,390
It's two people. Toilet paper and a drill. Neuro injectors can be found inside neuro medical

481
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:49,670
units at neuro checkpoints. Use them to permanently increase your health, stamina, or focus.

482
01:35:53,029 --> 01:36:01,590
How would you inject yourself? Health, stamina, or focused shot skill? I don't know.

483
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:18,220
This is a tough decision. Probably stamina. All right, ready? I'm gonna press them all at

484
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,579
the same time and when everyone happens, happens. Ready? One, two, three! Health.

485
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:45,579
There's a bed in here. Why would there be a gun locker here? This is weird. Speakers!

486
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:55,750
Why? Speakers!

487
01:36:55,750 --> 01:37:31,750
All right. I'm trying. Don't even use a weapon. Just swing. Speaker!

488
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:53,770
This game really likes to say son of a bitch. You missed. Oh god damn it. Just get out of my

489
01:37:53,770 --> 01:38:04,659
way. I don't have nitrous. Booster god damn it. Answer me. Booster god damn it. You son of a

490
01:38:04,659 --> 01:38:31,189
bitch. Come on. That was cool. When landing, you can reduce the damage. Angle your tires

491
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:41,479
parallel to the ground. Did I have to freeze the game every time I want to tell you anything?

492
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,789
You're just tired of listening to your paranoid truth, your bullshit.

493
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:59,109
Everything you say is fucking absolute. I thought it was a... I don't know what I...

494
01:39:02,710 --> 01:39:14,119
I just panicked. I panicked. I didn't really mean... I just panicked. I thought it was like

495
01:39:14,119 --> 01:39:19,560
an infected zoomer or whatever they are. Sometimes the best strategy is to run away.

496
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,880
If you have stamina available, press L for you to sprint. Thanks for the tip on my bike

497
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:57,800
at the checkpoint here. Thank you. Appreciate it. Come on. Get up there. Get up. Oh fine. Don't

498
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:05,510
let me have any fun. I was just gonna start shooting it and blow it up. That was a bad

499
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:16,380
idea. He's turning into a freaker as we speak. He's turning into a freaker as we speaker.

500
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:27,109
He's dead.

501
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:39,659
And then you play him as a playable character now.

502
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:53,779
Actually, I do need help. I can't do this.

503
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:07,399
Yeah, why would you leave the door wide open? This is Firewatch. It's the same thing in

504
01:41:07,399 --> 01:41:11,029
Firewatch. Bug the hell out.

505
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:35,899
300 nanometers that way. I can't even jump off this either. I can't like jump off that and

506
01:41:35,899 --> 01:42:02,710
land. No, hold on. Let me... Okay, let's go. I love freedom in environments. No, you go the

507
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:26,090
right way. I would call this game in a trend of closed world games. All right, let's go.

508
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:41,479
Oh my god. What? I can't believe you hit that thing. I can't believe you hit the dog.

509
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:02,649
That's it. All right. I don't know. I want my open world freedom. I'm going this way.

510
01:43:13,619 --> 01:43:29,000
Something's wrong. Where's my bike? Oh, it does sound... That sound is so... It really

511
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
is like waking up your grandfather instead of I fell off my bike and it crushed me.

512
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:40,220
Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa.

513
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:10,659
Stop pausing the game. Use scrap to repair your bike. Approach the bike and hold circle

514
01:44:10,659 --> 01:44:14,819
to begin repairing it. I thought this was a town that I was supposed to go to.

515
01:44:17,779 --> 01:45:03,529
All right, sounds good. Oh my god, I'm dead. Get off the bike. Okay, so I have $200 if

516
01:45:03,529 --> 01:45:14,260
anyone wants to sell me something. Sorry about all that. Oh, rifle. Get rifle. Get rifle. Get

517
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:31,449
rifle. Get rifle. Okay, all right, man. All right, so clear the ambush camp. Sure thing.

518
01:45:31,449 --> 01:45:38,229
So there's a couple more people here. Let me upgrade this.

519
01:45:44,899 --> 01:46:06,069
Video games. Oh, wait, I need to repair the bike. No, give me the... Do I have it?

520
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:37,720
Do I have the rifle? It's on your back. Is it repaired? No, I'm using scrap metal to fix it.

521
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:43,270
All right, cool. I need to see. You know what I mean? I have to test and see if this works.

522
01:46:44,069 --> 01:46:48,409
This is more important than anything else in the whole game. Am I going to sneak up on

523
01:46:48,409 --> 01:46:55,220
somebody and we have to do the cool thing, the desperate thing to have five million of these

524
01:46:55,220 --> 01:47:28,060
lying around? Because they want you to do this and I'm gonna do it. Well, he did it. It works.

525
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,840
By the way, that wouldn't even happen. Where am I? Am I all the way back here?

526
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:59,180
Of course it works. What did I end up? Oh, I have to do that again. That's what I want you

527
01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:09,720
to do. Yeah, it is. I'm gonna turn off the headlights. This time I'm not just gonna drive

528
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:14,859
straight in. I'm gonna leave the bike at the door. All right, all right, all right, all right.

529
01:48:14,859 --> 01:48:19,020
Now we're gonna just clear the camp. I'm gonna do this nice and slow and skillfully.

530
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:29,590
What? What am I holding? Is this a cocktail?

531
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:50,500
Something's out here, you asshole. Someone's hit. He's hiding. Look for him.

532
01:48:50,500 --> 01:49:01,960
Where's that coming from? I don't know. He's dead. Uh, yeah.

533
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:29,699
I didn't think you could actually hit them with the frog. Damn it. Where is he? Um,

534
01:49:34,039 --> 01:50:00,760
he's covering fire. A squirrel dropped an acorn on me. Shoot to kill. Dude,

535
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:09,140
I just felt this lady with rocks. Uh-oh. Who? Who found me? Is he shooting at her?

536
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:27,399
Are you the one throwing rocks? Are they even shooting at me? He's flanking me. Oh,

537
01:50:27,960 --> 01:51:03,159
all right. Well, I had my fun. I'm supposed to do this stealthily. Hold on. Let me search

538
01:51:03,159 --> 01:51:13,220
their bodies. All right. This is what I'm talking about here, man. Get them both. I

539
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:27,539
need ammo for this. I don't have any ammo. Can I even replace the uh, I don't think I

540
01:51:27,539 --> 01:51:32,500
can even replace the crossbow. It's primary. Get rifle. I got it. I got it. I got it.

541
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:39,939
Check this out. All right. We're fine. There we go. Let's just take them out. Nice and slow.

542
01:51:39,939 --> 01:51:51,800
Do it right. They're throwing rocks at us. How many are them? I don't know. They might be

543
01:51:51,800 --> 01:52:14,550
200. Where did you come from? They shoot when I'm... You guys are really stupid.

544
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:26,949
He's pretending to be dead. They're playing a gigantic game of telephone.

545
01:52:37,689 --> 01:52:43,689
Hey, he shot me and then distance. He's been shot. Somebody shot him. Somebody shot him.

546
01:52:45,420 --> 01:53:15,420
Boom. Oh, God. What happened here? Kill me. All right. I think I just alerted the horde.

547
01:53:17,859 --> 01:53:41,319
Did I really? Oh, fuck. Hold on. Where is he? He's not here. Where's this guy?

548
01:53:41,319 --> 01:54:08,329
You got him. What do you mean, got him? Oh, fuck. All right. Hold on. This is my opportunity

549
01:54:08,329 --> 01:54:23,989
to do this. Watch this. Ready? I gotta get this right. Go that way. Go that way so I can

550
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:40,229
throw it in the fire. Who killed who there? I don't know. Did the eye die there? Who's

551
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:45,619
got the... Who killed... Who killed who? Hey, where is he? Have we got some tail? You know,

552
01:54:45,619 --> 01:54:55,819
we got... Moonshine! I stabbed myself in the stomach. He's gonna get the same spiel.

553
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:33,260
He tricked me. He tricked me. Wait, I'm gonna go get another one. Just stay there.

554
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:48,489
He's dumb. I'll be fine. Is somebody in this building? He's gonna come in here, isn't he?

555
01:55:53,220 --> 01:56:09,640
What's head level right here? Right. Whoa! I thought the gun... I thought the rock was

556
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:34,630
a fucking explosive bullet rock for a second. Where'd he go? Get in here. Yeah, I'm in there.

557
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:49,079
Come on in. Just step in the door. Step inside of here. Okay, he's gonna get covered.

558
01:56:52,060 --> 01:57:22,699
Don't fall back. Get in. Did they seriously run away? All right, that's enough.

559
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:49,590
I'm pissed off. Let's go. Let's heal and let's get out of here. Exclusive. This is an exclusive

560
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:54,489
game. This is a Sony PlayStation exclusive. You can only get this on the PlayStation 4.

561
01:58:05,939 --> 01:58:10,020
Turn up the difficulty. I feel like that would make the game harder, though.

562
01:58:10,659 --> 01:58:17,770
You know, that makes the game difficult. I don't do that. You gotta get a PS4. Get one. Oh.

563
01:58:18,489 --> 01:58:23,909
Hey. If you had bullets, I wouldn't be breathing now, would I? You've been the one

564
01:58:23,909 --> 01:58:32,229
throwing rocks. Please, mister. Don't shoot women if I have a choice. I have a choice.

565
01:58:32,229 --> 01:58:44,949
I ain't got nothing. I got nowhere to go. You got it that way. What is your opportunity?

566
01:58:45,989 --> 01:58:56,779
There's always some way. All right, let's see if they got an underground bunker around here.

567
01:58:56,779 --> 01:59:09,350
Investigate the bunker. I got nowhere to go. We all got nowhere to go. Yes. I mean,

568
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:44,409
here it is. I can't even slide down. I can't fast go down. I can't really. Nothing in here besides

569
01:59:45,449 --> 01:59:55,239
the storyline. Stupid. Stupid. There it is. I had to get it right, sorry. Looks like they

570
01:59:55,239 --> 02:00:07,560
marked it up good. 91% that's an A-. Gear up for the ride. Me and Boozer can't ride north

571
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:14,220
until I fix up this bike. Get some better gear. Craft unlocked. Ambush camp hunter.

572
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:27,800
I can make people. Spiked bat. Yes, yes, yes. Newly discovered craft recipes are shown in the

573
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:40,329
survival wheel. Yes, yes, yes. It sounded like bike engines riding somewhere on the mountain.

574
02:00:40,329 --> 02:00:45,939
I just finished clearing it. Use a bunk at safe locations like bunkers or the safe houses

575
02:00:45,939 --> 02:00:49,779
to leave in advance time. Some challenges like infestations can be approached differently

576
02:00:49,779 --> 02:00:53,539
depending on the time of day. Additionally, progress can be saved when you're a bunk.

577
02:00:53,539 --> 02:00:56,779
The radio tower for Copeland. Climb the tower. See if I can see.

578
02:00:57,579 --> 02:01:08,520
We're gonna climb the tower. I'm just gonna close my eyes for a little bit.

579
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:27,239
I'm still on the phone. You know, you say some real fucked up shit and you sleep.

580
02:01:27,239 --> 02:01:32,939
I don't think I've ever heard somebody say they want to shove an ice cream up their ass.

581
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:59,850
Cold side first. All right, let's go. Get up. Oh, it's X. What the fuck?

582
02:02:03,289 --> 02:02:25,829
That sounds like a one guy comment. Don't sound like yourself. It's nothing. You know,

583
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:31,510
I just let this drifter get the drop on me. Lucky for me, she was out of ammo.

584
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:34,520
You know, the game's boring and the streamer is always too ass jokes.

585
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:40,659
Yes, yes, I let her go. It's a climbable tower.

586
02:02:44,310 --> 02:02:49,109
Yeah, well, something's gonna do it, right? Does it matter what Deacon out?

587
02:02:49,829 --> 02:02:57,939
Jesus, what a climb. All right, let's see what the hell was just talking about.

588
02:02:57,939 --> 02:03:01,619
All right, look at the O'Leary Mountain safe house. It's doing it for me, so don't worry.

589
02:03:02,100 --> 02:03:07,050
We're right. Someone's on the mountain. I see smoke from their campfire.

590
02:03:08,489 --> 02:03:12,840
Son of a bitch. I knew I heard something. Where are they? I'm gonna head out there.

591
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:17,239
No, god damn it. Boozer, gotta get your arm healed up so we can ride the hell out of here.

592
02:03:17,239 --> 02:03:23,319
I'll take care of him. Mark, it's just, I'm going a little stir crazy here, Deacon.

593
02:03:25,270 --> 02:03:28,949
Just try to stay awake in case they head your way. Deacon out.

594
02:03:29,909 --> 02:03:34,810
There's no, I can't jump. Do I actually have to climb down this?

595
02:03:35,449 --> 02:03:40,619
I don't want to do the whole climb again. I can't slide.

596
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:52,890
Leap of faith. No, but I mean, there's no, I can like, no.

597
02:03:53,850 --> 02:03:55,670
I guess this is how you actually would do it.

598
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:24,630
I just had to go up and down the ladder. That's it.

599
02:04:26,039 --> 02:04:29,399
Locate the camp. All right, can I call my bike and I whistle from my bike?

600
02:04:42,199 --> 02:04:46,760
Now you can fall off. Now you fall off and take damage when you fall.

601
02:04:47,399 --> 02:04:55,399
Took us this far to figure that out. All right, there's a...

602
02:05:04,949 --> 02:05:16,010
Encore. Encore. Encore. I could do that. That's bullshit.

603
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:21,420
I swear to god I could fall down this. I could go down that. I know I could.

604
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:32,539
Look, that was the difference. That's not much of a difference.

605
02:05:32,939 --> 02:05:35,899
That's amazing. Yeah, I do need some. Deacon out.

606
02:05:35,899 --> 02:05:43,239
I need my bike. Oh, fuck. There's my bike behind me the whole time.

607
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:55,029
No, I'm not doing it again. It's not gonna be the third encore.

608
02:05:55,029 --> 02:06:08,899
No, it was right here. Okay. All right, we're good. Let's move on.

609
02:06:14,329 --> 02:06:18,310
Wow, what the hell? Can I climb this?

610
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:24,619
You wouldn't put a tree bent over like this if I couldn't just tightrope on it, right?

611
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:36,819
I guess so. Gunfire. Does that mean anything?

612
02:06:37,539 --> 02:06:59,779
Who's shooting? Oh, that's the motorcycle doing that.

613
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:13,500
I'm out of gas. Mechanics can repair or refuel your bike for a fee.

614
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,500
The price adds up, so take care of your bike when you can.

615
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:20,460
While your bike is idle, you can walk it backward or forward.

616
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:22,380
If you're trying to be quiet or you're out of gas,

617
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:24,779
you can walk your bike around as long as the path isn't too steep.

618
02:07:25,659 --> 02:07:47,060
How do I walk it? No, I have to walk the bike.

619
02:07:48,359 --> 02:07:58,920
No, I'm sorry. I have to... Just leave me alone. I don't want anything...

620
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:18,039
They're still fucking chasing me. I'm out of stamina.

621
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:20,460
All right, I have to... desperate.

622
02:08:30,810 --> 02:08:34,010
Please, just leave me alone. I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to kill you.

623
02:08:34,010 --> 02:08:49,819
I have to. Unfortunately, I have to.

624
02:08:49,819 --> 02:08:55,430
My god, he's faster than I can aim.

625
02:08:56,310 --> 02:09:02,310
You leaving? The stick aiming is slower than he can move.

626
02:09:03,029 --> 02:09:05,210
How many... What the fuck?

627
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:09,050
No way, dude! Oh my god!

628
02:09:17,539 --> 02:09:21,609
All right, let me walk the bike. How do I walk the bike?

629
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:24,859
Did it tell me a button combination?

630
02:09:26,409 --> 02:09:29,449
No, I'm out in front of the coin-operated toy in front of Walmart.

631
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:39,640
It's too steep.

632
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,569
No, it's not.

633
02:09:47,859 --> 02:09:52,090
No, I'm good. I'm on my tricycle.

634
02:09:52,090 --> 02:10:00,310
I see a gas station. I'm fine.

635
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:09,460
On the road, where it's safe.

636
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:14,420
And then I can just glide. Yeah, now I can just glide.

637
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,619
Cool gameplay.

638
02:10:37,779 --> 02:10:43,319
I'll get there eventually.

639
02:10:43,319 --> 02:10:44,439
What happens if I leave the bike?

640
02:10:45,239 --> 02:10:49,100
Can I get the bike back eventually?

641
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,100
Or is it one of those scenarios where I have to keep it with me?

642
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,819
St. John to Copeland's camp is done.

643
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:57,659
The radio tower's locked down and I've restored your radio buffling.

644
02:10:58,859 --> 02:11:03,020
Not see the value in St. John.

645
02:11:03,020 --> 02:11:07,100
But radio-free Oregon is the only thing keeping us from turning into savages.

646
02:11:09,579 --> 02:11:11,420
A wheelchair would be faster.

647
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:12,939
Savages is about nine square meals.

648
02:11:13,579 --> 02:11:15,579
Try going hungry for three days.

649
02:11:15,579 --> 02:11:17,739
There's no such thing as a starving patriot.

650
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:20,939
Well, sir, booze man, I have your word.

651
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:23,260
They set up all the railroad tracks.

652
02:11:23,260 --> 02:11:24,619
There's got to be gas in here.

653
02:11:24,619 --> 02:11:25,340
There's going to be gas.

654
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:27,659
Kill every one of the sons of bitches.

655
02:11:27,659 --> 02:11:31,529
Gas? Come on.

656
02:11:36,020 --> 02:11:36,899
Ooh, fire axe.

657
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:55,050
Can I craft gas?

658
02:11:59,539 --> 02:12:00,979
I'm not sure I can craft.

659
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:01,939
Can I craft?

660
02:12:01,939 --> 02:12:03,380
That's just a tractor.

661
02:12:06,739 --> 02:12:07,380
Pipe bombs.

662
02:12:09,300 --> 02:12:10,260
Pipe bomb, huh?

663
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:10,979
Where did I get these?

664
02:12:11,939 --> 02:12:15,449
By holding L2 and aim to press to throw.

665
02:12:16,760 --> 02:12:17,260
Well.

666
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:46,199
Is that going to explode?

667
02:12:50,859 --> 02:12:52,060
Hey, somebody's hit.

668
02:12:53,659 --> 02:12:57,100
It had nothing to do with the pipe bomb.

669
02:13:16,979 --> 02:13:17,859
I'm not unkillable.

670
02:13:17,859 --> 02:13:19,220
See, I can still play on normal.

671
02:13:19,859 --> 02:13:24,710
Do I have gas?

672
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:29,109
Hey, hey, wait, wait.

673
02:13:29,109 --> 02:13:30,470
Why am I already in combat?

674
02:13:44,949 --> 02:13:49,079
I can't die on the bike.

675
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:00,789
That was a fucking marionette on my leg.

676
02:14:00,789 --> 02:14:01,670
All right, here we go.

677
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:12,920
Maybe you should stop screaming shit and attracting people.

678
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:18,579
Yeah, you just heard gunshots.

679
02:14:20,119 --> 02:14:21,239
I think they're shooting at me.

680
02:14:22,859 --> 02:14:23,579
I'm not good.

681
02:14:23,579 --> 02:14:24,859
I might be mistaken though.

682
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:30,270
Brax.

683
02:14:54,090 --> 02:14:55,210
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop.

684
02:14:55,210 --> 02:14:55,850
You're getting stuck.

685
02:14:55,850 --> 02:14:57,050
Stop getting stuck.

686
02:14:57,050 --> 02:15:19,180
Okay, can I please just get out of here?

687
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:25,539
He shot me.

688
02:15:26,180 --> 02:15:27,140
Why did he shoot me?

689
02:15:27,779 --> 02:15:42,180
I'm about to roll up in there and just start swinging.

690
02:15:42,180 --> 02:15:47,130
All right, let me search.

691
02:15:54,220 --> 02:16:03,220
I gotta, just go, go, go, go.

692
02:16:03,220 --> 02:16:04,020
Just walk it this way.

693
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:04,579
Who cares?

694
02:16:04,579 --> 02:16:05,060
I don't care.

695
02:16:05,619 --> 02:16:24,489
I have to go down here.

696
02:16:27,539 --> 02:16:28,659
All right, I'm not fucking around.

697
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,939
Not anymore.

698
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:39,760
Come on.

699
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:01,479
He has one of those too.

700
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:14,139
Like a bear trap.

701
02:17:14,139 --> 02:17:14,780
What?

702
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:33,239
Can he go in this?

703
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:39,079
Put it under him.

704
02:17:48,170 --> 02:17:52,250
Hey, how did he not go on the ground and catch my leg?

705
02:18:00,809 --> 02:18:02,170
Heel, heel, heel, heel, heel.

706
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,700
Oh my god.

707
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,219
How do I have another one?

708
02:18:07,219 --> 02:18:09,110
Plus three bear trap.

709
02:18:09,110 --> 02:18:10,469
Plus four bear trap.

710
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:13,989
Plus five, six, seven, eight.

711
02:18:13,989 --> 02:18:15,350
I just get infinite bear trap.

712
02:18:15,989 --> 02:18:36,500
I could sell these too.

713
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:44,899
He's duping.

714
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:47,059
He's resorted to duping.

715
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:57,829
All right, I'll do it with 50.

716
02:18:57,829 --> 02:19:06,120
50 is like, it's gonna be like five grand.

717
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:06,680
Okay.

718
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:32,790
Where's bear trap?

719
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:34,389
So I don't have any.

720
02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:35,819
How do I not have any?

721
02:19:35,819 --> 02:19:39,989
It says plus 50.

722
02:19:39,989 --> 02:20:03,180
Waiting to jump me.

723
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:06,729
Step in it.

724
02:20:07,780 --> 02:20:10,229
Oh, no.

725
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:11,909
You're not gonna roll.

726
02:20:11,909 --> 02:20:13,430
Oh fuck, I have no ammo.

727
02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:23,610
Oh, you dick.

728
02:20:23,610 --> 02:20:29,209
Pick it up.

729
02:20:29,209 --> 02:20:30,250
Mother fucker.

730
02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:51,270
You talking to me?

731
02:20:51,270 --> 02:20:52,709
Yeah, nice job, man.

732
02:20:52,709 --> 02:20:53,350
Kill him.

733
02:20:53,350 --> 02:21:01,459
That guy sucked you out of me 20 bucks.

734
02:21:01,459 --> 02:21:03,350
All right, there's only one guy left, all right?

735
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:15,590
This guy right here is two.

736
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:17,110
We're gonna kill the guy with the handgun.

737
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:35,500
Okay, give me the fucking bear trap.

738
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:36,139
I have to do this.

739
02:21:36,780 --> 02:21:38,139
This is so important.

740
02:21:38,139 --> 02:22:05,989
Where'd he go?

741
02:22:05,989 --> 02:22:07,770
Is he behind?

742
02:22:07,770 --> 02:22:08,489
Where is he?

743
02:22:08,489 --> 02:22:11,020
Oh fuck, he's right there.

744
02:22:11,739 --> 02:22:18,819
Come on, do it.

745
02:22:18,819 --> 02:22:20,020
Just come over here.

746
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:23,209
I need to see this, if it's possible.

747
02:22:23,209 --> 02:22:24,760
If not, then who cares, right?

748
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:30,420
If I'm hidden for long and I feel he comes out,

749
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:32,500
because he can't see me.

750
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:35,450
Come on, come out.

751
02:22:41,690 --> 02:22:43,530
Oh fuck, he's going, he's wrapping the other way.

752
02:22:43,530 --> 02:22:44,569
Give me, hold on.

753
02:22:44,569 --> 02:22:46,889
Don't take this.

754
02:22:46,889 --> 02:22:47,909
Where is he?

755
02:22:47,909 --> 02:22:48,469
It's right there.

756
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:52,260
I don't think he knows where I am.

757
02:22:53,959 --> 02:22:55,079
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

758
02:22:55,079 --> 02:22:56,200
Okay, here we go, ready?

759
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:17,180
Oh my god, which way is he going?

760
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:21,319
I haven't moved from this spot.

761
02:23:21,319 --> 02:23:22,760
How would you not know where I was?

762
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:24,680
This is our opportunity.

763
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:26,020
Here it comes.

764
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:33,989
Should I just sneak up behind him?

765
02:23:33,989 --> 02:23:35,510
Okay, here's the plan, ready?

766
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:40,870
The plan is throw a rock, sneak up behind him.

767
02:23:40,870 --> 02:23:50,409
He's not listening to the rock.

768
02:23:50,409 --> 02:23:51,850
I can't, I can't tell if he's,

769
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:52,329
what's he doing?

770
02:23:52,329 --> 02:23:53,530
He's so erratic right now.

771
02:23:53,530 --> 02:24:00,649
He's not listening anymore.

772
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:08,219
Okay, I'm gonna try something.

773
02:24:08,219 --> 02:24:09,899
One, two, three.

774
02:24:09,899 --> 02:24:19,049
I don't know where he went.

775
02:24:19,049 --> 02:24:19,930
Where'd he go?

776
02:24:19,930 --> 02:24:21,420
Where the fuck did he go?

777
02:24:21,979 --> 02:24:22,940
Where did he go?

778
02:24:22,940 --> 02:24:23,579
Where did he go?

779
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:27,559
Is he behind me?

780
02:24:27,559 --> 02:24:32,010
Where did he go?

781
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:33,049
Is he behind the tent?

782
02:24:53,319 --> 02:24:57,299
God damn it.

783
02:24:57,299 --> 02:25:01,190
All right, I tried, I tried.

784
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:03,110
Oh fuck, I don't want to do this again.

785
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:05,110
Okay, I'm just gonna do this as fast as possible now.

786
02:25:19,219 --> 02:25:19,860
Hold on, I'll get it.

787
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:21,059
Just wait, I'm gonna do it really fast.

788
02:25:21,059 --> 02:25:22,819
I'm gonna make sure I get this done like right now.

789
02:25:27,819 --> 02:25:28,940
Oh, I can't even go back.

790
02:25:29,659 --> 02:25:30,159
Bitches.

791
02:25:46,250 --> 02:25:47,770
You have a shotgun.

792
02:25:49,510 --> 02:25:50,549
There's no way.

793
02:26:08,709 --> 02:26:09,750
No, fuck, what?

794
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:13,290
No, take it seriously, please.

795
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:19,370
Heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.

796
02:26:21,049 --> 02:26:48,379
Wait, I just like froze him in time.

797
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:50,940
He's still, oh no.

798
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:55,159
No, no, no, no, no.

799
02:26:55,159 --> 02:26:56,600
I put it in the trap.

800
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:07,659
What trap?

801
02:27:08,459 --> 02:27:10,379
I put the other one down to my left.

802
02:27:10,379 --> 02:27:11,420
I picked, didn't I pick that?

803
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:16,780
Here we go, this is for real this time.

804
02:27:17,579 --> 02:27:22,440
I was stupid to pay attention to the guy that was on the cliff.

805
02:27:27,159 --> 02:27:29,000
I know I put the one down to my left,

806
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,600
but I didn't pick the one up to my right.

807
02:27:32,299 --> 02:27:33,819
No, I want to go up here.

808
02:27:33,819 --> 02:27:35,500
What's with every game nowadays?

809
02:27:36,459 --> 02:27:38,940
Your hitbox is like five people wide.

810
02:27:40,250 --> 02:27:41,610
I want to like go over here.

811
02:27:41,610 --> 02:27:43,530
It's like, you didn't want to like run out here

812
02:27:43,530 --> 02:27:45,290
all the way over here and then stop.

813
02:27:46,010 --> 02:27:47,030
All right, here we go.

814
02:27:47,030 --> 02:27:48,870
Fucking mad because bad.

815
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:49,909
Mad because bad.

816
02:27:49,909 --> 02:27:50,790
Mad because bad.

817
02:27:56,329 --> 02:27:57,770
Thank God I slid through it.

818
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:24,600
What the hell?

819
02:28:25,719 --> 02:28:27,770
What the hell?

820
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:28,729
What is this thing over here?

821
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:36,309
There's no trap, don't worry.

822
02:28:36,309 --> 02:28:42,819
Oh my fucking god damn.

823
02:28:42,819 --> 02:28:43,860
Now you have shotguns.

824
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:45,780
Now you're shooting the shotgun with ease.

825
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:55,239
No, give me the...

826
02:28:55,879 --> 02:29:04,889
They just always appear behind me.

827
02:29:10,969 --> 02:29:16,709
Okay, so I need to stop fucking around.

828
02:29:16,709 --> 02:29:34,579
They're still alive.

829
02:29:34,579 --> 02:29:35,540
Oh, you motherfucker.

830
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:47,739
No, I have one bullet left.

831
02:29:48,299 --> 02:30:06,899
Dude, how many people are in this camp?

832
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:29,670
How many bullets do I have?

833
02:30:29,670 --> 02:30:30,549
Is the ammo in here?

834
02:30:30,549 --> 02:30:34,489
What am I doing?

835
02:30:34,489 --> 02:30:35,659
No, I want that.

836
02:30:35,659 --> 02:30:36,139
I want...

837
02:30:36,139 --> 02:30:36,860
I don't want this.

838
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:37,819
I can't...

839
02:30:37,819 --> 02:30:39,100
I don't have ammo.

840
02:30:39,100 --> 02:30:48,569
What happened?

841
02:30:48,569 --> 02:30:48,969
Did I...

842
02:30:50,809 --> 02:30:55,370
All right, I'm about sick of my incompetence here.

843
02:30:56,329 --> 02:30:56,649
What is...

844
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:11,020
Yes, they set up on the railroad tracks.

845
02:31:12,739 --> 02:31:15,559
Okay, kill everyone and I...

846
02:31:19,909 --> 02:31:23,799
Give me my binoculars.

847
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:26,020
I want to like mark them.

848
02:31:27,370 --> 02:31:28,729
Give me my binoculars.

849
02:31:28,729 --> 02:31:30,729
Why can't I not use my binoculars to mark people?

850
02:31:31,370 --> 02:31:32,569
They've made such a big deal of that.

851
02:31:33,129 --> 02:31:52,389
I want the rock.

852
02:31:53,110 --> 02:31:57,399
All right, what the fuck are you doing?

853
02:31:59,059 --> 02:32:00,100
Category distraction.

854
02:32:00,659 --> 02:32:01,299
Put the...

855
02:32:01,299 --> 02:32:02,420
What the fuck are you doing?

856
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:03,299
Put the rock on.

857
02:32:04,260 --> 02:32:05,059
I want the rock.

858
02:32:07,989 --> 02:32:09,030
What the hell is going on?

859
02:32:09,590 --> 02:32:16,219
Do I not have any more rocks?

860
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:28,489
All right, somebody's gotta explain to me why I can't select the rock.

861
02:32:29,129 --> 02:32:41,209
It doesn't like me.

862
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:42,969
I think I'm just gonna go...

863
02:32:42,969 --> 02:32:43,770
I'm just killing them.

864
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:44,969
Like, we're just gonna kill them.

865
02:32:44,969 --> 02:32:45,690
I'm just gonna kill them.

866
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:46,409
I just have to make this...

867
02:32:46,409 --> 02:32:46,969
They're all right here.

868
02:32:46,969 --> 02:32:47,370
Watch this.

869
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:47,610
Ready?

870
02:32:47,610 --> 02:32:48,809
I'm gonna get one shot here.

871
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:49,610
Kill.

872
02:32:50,729 --> 02:32:51,209
Dead.

873
02:32:51,209 --> 02:32:52,329
No, I hit him right in the head though.

874
02:33:01,559 --> 02:33:02,280
Oh my god.

875
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:12,969
If I just could put my fucking rocks on.

876
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:14,649
I'm gonna make these count.

877
02:33:32,950 --> 02:33:33,510
Almost out.

878
02:33:34,069 --> 02:33:48,620
I'm gonna get closer.

879
02:33:49,989 --> 02:33:50,629
Wait for me?

880
02:33:50,629 --> 02:33:51,110
Huh?

881
02:33:51,110 --> 02:34:16,340
My god!

882
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,540
I've seen that coming.

883
02:34:27,670 --> 02:34:49,459
That's the last of them.

884
02:34:50,020 --> 02:34:53,180
Let's take the hell off of Leery Mountain.

885
02:34:54,219 --> 02:34:55,819
You sound like you're having fun.

886
02:34:59,049 --> 02:35:00,250
I am, actually.

887
02:35:00,250 --> 02:35:03,059
I have to keep Boozer alive.

888
02:35:05,739 --> 02:35:08,299
I'm gonna have to go back and walk my car.

889
02:35:09,500 --> 02:35:20,389
Boozer, he's done.

890
02:35:26,149 --> 02:35:27,909
Boozer, he's done.

891
02:35:27,909 --> 02:35:28,709
Squad of camp.

892
02:35:29,430 --> 02:35:31,670
They won't be doing any more killing on O'Leery Mountain.

893
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:37,909
Hank, I should have been there.

894
02:35:38,709 --> 02:35:40,149
Another bear trap joke.

895
02:35:41,989 --> 02:35:44,069
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

896
02:35:44,069 --> 02:35:45,430
Rest up, booze man.

897
02:35:45,430 --> 02:35:47,829
Rest up before we ride north as soon as your army heals.

898
02:35:47,829 --> 02:35:48,389
You got that?

899
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:50,069
Jerem's fuming, dude.

900
02:35:50,069 --> 02:35:51,110
He's fuming, he's fuming.

901
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:03,159
Let's go.

902
02:36:03,719 --> 02:36:05,979
Yeah, I'm gonna ride up to the cemetery.

903
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:08,219
See if I can find the hot stash.

904
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:10,059
Sorry.

905
02:36:10,059 --> 02:36:11,260
There's no gas down there.

906
02:36:12,540 --> 02:36:13,739
Rest up, Boozer.

907
02:36:13,739 --> 02:36:15,420
We're heading north as soon as you can ride.

908
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:23,739
Out of nowhere map.

909
02:36:23,739 --> 02:36:24,620
Where are we going?

910
02:36:24,620 --> 02:36:25,420
Storylines.

911
02:36:25,979 --> 02:36:29,020
View story progress, view gameplay rewards, and activate missions.

912
02:36:31,639 --> 02:36:34,200
So, crazy Willy's infestation.

913
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:35,559
World's end.

914
02:36:37,110 --> 02:36:39,270
Or out of chasing Leon.

915
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:40,069
Out of nowhere.

916
02:36:40,069 --> 02:36:43,190
Search the pioneer cemetery for Leon's drug stash.

917
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:44,649
That's the one we're gonna do.

918
02:36:46,979 --> 02:36:47,540
God damn it.

919
02:36:48,340 --> 02:36:50,659
786 meters this way.

920
02:36:52,979 --> 02:36:54,969
Deke, you there?

921
02:36:54,969 --> 02:36:56,649
Just give me some forward momentum.

922
02:36:56,649 --> 02:36:57,770
Did you say you were heading north?

923
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:58,940
Booze man, no.

924
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:03,590
Yeah, yeah, I know.

925
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:04,549
I just kind of...

926
02:37:04,549 --> 02:37:05,670
There's no gas down here.

927
02:37:07,620 --> 02:37:09,219
Third degree burns will do that to you.

928
02:37:12,229 --> 02:37:14,790
So, take care of Alvarez, you know?

929
02:37:14,790 --> 02:37:15,430
Let me just check.

930
02:37:15,989 --> 02:37:17,110
Deke, there's a lot to do.

931
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:18,389
Better get walking.

932
02:37:18,389 --> 02:37:19,110
Yeah, I know.

933
02:37:19,110 --> 02:37:20,469
I better start moving.

934
02:37:20,469 --> 02:37:21,750
Take care of her, Boozer.

935
02:37:21,750 --> 02:37:23,670
Just get some rest.

936
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:24,309
Deke, get out.

937
02:37:24,870 --> 02:37:26,229
I can't like dump that in the tank.

938
02:37:36,709 --> 02:37:39,750
Imagine unironically thinking you were a GTA character.

939
02:37:53,159 --> 02:37:54,920
Biggest vroom ever.

940
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:55,319
Maybe.

941
02:38:05,260 --> 02:38:06,620
Nah, I don't think so, Cope.

942
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:07,180
Not today.

943
02:38:08,819 --> 02:38:09,459
All right, I need to go...

944
02:38:09,459 --> 02:38:09,860
Here we go.

945
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,579
I see a car.

946
02:38:10,579 --> 02:38:11,620
I see a gas station.

947
02:38:11,620 --> 02:38:13,059
We just have to coast our way into it.

948
02:38:14,260 --> 02:38:15,780
Gas station right there.

949
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:16,280
Cars.

950
02:38:23,319 --> 02:38:23,879
What the fuck?

951
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:27,670
What was that?

952
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:28,170
Why?

953
02:38:28,870 --> 02:38:29,370
What?

954
02:38:30,709 --> 02:38:32,069
I needed that gas.

955
02:38:32,069 --> 02:38:33,430
Who has a sniper?

956
02:38:35,559 --> 02:38:37,799
What in the fucking name of God is happening?

957
02:38:38,520 --> 02:38:49,770
Give me that thing.

958
02:38:55,399 --> 02:38:55,799
Oh, fuck.

959
02:38:55,799 --> 02:38:56,680
I have no more...

960
02:38:56,840 --> 02:38:59,000
Please, please, please, please, please, please heal.

961
02:39:12,010 --> 02:39:14,729
I don't understand why somebody just drove a flaming car down at me.

962
02:39:14,729 --> 02:39:15,690
Where was the car?

963
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:18,549
What was the set?

964
02:39:18,549 --> 02:39:20,149
They just came out of nowhere.

965
02:39:24,309 --> 02:39:25,270
Some guns are so powerful,

966
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:28,569
their shots can pierce through multiple enemies with one round.

967
02:39:28,569 --> 02:39:30,170
Trying lining up multiple enemies.

968
02:39:30,170 --> 02:39:30,670
Okay.

969
02:39:34,360 --> 02:39:35,479
Shot the place up.

970
02:39:35,479 --> 02:39:37,920
Then he just took off.

971
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:40,219
And he said his box got erected.

972
02:39:40,219 --> 02:39:42,319
He was wearing some kind of motocross helmet.

973
02:39:42,319 --> 02:39:42,819
Silver.

974
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:46,079
Okay, if I go now, I might be able to catch up to him.

975
02:39:47,370 --> 02:39:48,969
I want him alive, Deke.

976
02:39:48,969 --> 02:39:50,100
Alive.

977
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:51,280
I needed that gas that was in this car.

978
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:51,780
Alive.

979
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:55,209
You catch this guy, then radio me.

980
02:39:55,209 --> 02:40:00,040
Fetch him and hang the bastard right from this time we start showing these drifters,

981
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:02,120
sons of bitches, that we have law and order in this kingdom.

982
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:03,159
One bullet in this.

983
02:40:03,159 --> 02:40:03,879
No offence meant to yourself.

984
02:40:03,879 --> 02:40:04,680
I better be ready.

985
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:06,520
All right, let's get it up.

986
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,079
I'll take it.

987
02:40:07,079 --> 02:40:07,799
I'll find him.

988
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:11,100
How's this thing doing?

989
02:40:11,819 --> 02:40:14,219
You can't boost without equipping your bike with nitrous.

990
02:40:15,639 --> 02:40:15,959
Thanks.

991
02:40:19,479 --> 02:40:21,239
All right, let's go.

992
02:40:24,569 --> 02:40:26,010
I can't believe there's no gas over here.

993
02:40:31,899 --> 02:40:33,020
I'm gonna check down there.

994
02:40:33,659 --> 02:40:36,620
There has to be gas over here.

995
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:37,579
Has to be. Look it.

996
02:40:37,579 --> 02:40:39,500
It's like a bunch of big gas tanks right there.

997
02:40:46,959 --> 02:40:47,459
Gas?

998
02:40:52,649 --> 02:40:53,290
Gas.

999
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:54,569
Give me something to gas.

1000
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:56,010
Anything.

1001
02:40:57,440 --> 02:40:57,940
Please.

1002
02:41:12,159 --> 02:41:12,659
Gas.

1003
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:14,719
No, no gas.

1004
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:20,969
Are you serious?

1005
02:41:21,690 --> 02:41:32,090
It's just like a lighter fluid.

1006
02:41:32,090 --> 02:41:32,729
It's not gas.

1007
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:35,520
Oh, found it.

1008
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:36,879
Thank god.

1009
02:41:42,079 --> 02:41:43,600
Fill it up and get me out of here.

1010
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,559
Fill it up.

1011
02:41:55,559 --> 02:42:02,079
All right, repair the bike because I just got run over.

1012
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:07,840
Finally, it's gonna feel so good to actually be able to ride this thing again.

1013
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:12,809
Feels so different.

1014
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:18,590
Let's go.

1015
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:23,049
The boos are...

1016
02:42:23,049 --> 02:42:24,010
No, no.

1017
02:42:24,010 --> 02:42:25,129
You're gonna get yourself killed.

1018
02:42:25,850 --> 02:42:28,090
You're gonna wait till you're whole, brother.

1019
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:30,649
Nitrous, too.

1020
02:42:30,649 --> 02:42:33,930
I'm over here anyway, so I'll take care of that mess.

1021
02:42:33,930 --> 02:42:34,489
Right up here.

1022
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:41,040
All right, clear the logging camp infestation zone.

1023
02:42:42,079 --> 02:42:48,729
You just ran two stopsides.

1024
02:42:48,729 --> 02:42:49,209
That's fine.

1025
02:42:49,209 --> 02:42:49,930
There's nobody here.

1026
02:42:50,649 --> 02:43:00,750
I feel like it's just...

1027
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:01,389
Yeah, let's just...

1028
02:43:01,389 --> 02:43:02,829
I'm cutting through here.

1029
02:43:02,829 --> 02:43:03,790
I'm not gonna follow the road.

1030
02:43:03,790 --> 02:43:04,989
The GPS in this game is dumb.

1031
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:08,590
It's a post-apocalyptic world.

1032
02:43:08,590 --> 02:43:09,790
You don't have to follow the roads.

1033
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:22,079
Shit.

1034
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:23,209
Can I jump it?

1035
02:43:23,850 --> 02:43:27,229
This is Radio Free Oregon.

1036
02:43:27,229 --> 02:43:29,469
The truth shall set you free.

1037
02:43:29,469 --> 02:43:31,600
This earth is a gift for us all.

1038
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:32,399
Okay, I'm good.

1039
02:43:32,399 --> 02:43:34,079
To use as we see fit.

1040
02:43:34,799 --> 02:43:37,200
To provide for ourselves and our families.

1041
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:39,200
I'm not saying this.

1042
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:42,639
It's the Lord that gave us dominion over it.

1043
02:43:42,639 --> 02:43:44,760
But that wasn't enough for some men.

1044
02:43:45,559 --> 02:43:46,760
They wanted more.

1045
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:50,479
When our fuel down, they jacked up the prices

1046
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:53,200
so they could consolidate power into their own hands.

1047
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:56,879
So we wanted to build dams for electricity.

1048
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:59,520
But they're precious runs of salmon.

1049
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:00,399
Coke, Coke, Coke.

1050
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:01,520
Shut the hell up.

1051
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:01,920
Return...

1052
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:02,239
What do you mean?

1053
02:44:02,239 --> 02:44:03,360
Return to shore.

1054
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:10,000
What?

1055
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:22,969
You can't be in water for more than three seconds

1056
02:44:22,969 --> 02:44:23,530
so you drown.

1057
02:44:24,409 --> 02:44:27,280
Closed world game.

1058
02:44:28,940 --> 02:44:29,340
Coin it.

1059
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:30,379
That's a new phrase, man.

1060
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:38,760
Why can't you go in the water?

1061
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:40,920
I mean, very clearly I could go in the water.

1062
02:44:41,559 --> 02:44:43,790
There's even a swimming animation.

1063
02:44:53,770 --> 02:44:54,649
That's really odd.

1064
02:44:57,049 --> 02:44:59,129
If you're gonna have a swimming animation in the game

1065
02:44:59,129 --> 02:45:00,809
and what's the point of making it

1066
02:45:00,809 --> 02:45:02,729
so you can swim for three seconds and die?

1067
02:45:03,610 --> 02:45:08,379
Is this gonna happen again?

1068
02:45:10,879 --> 02:45:13,600
Is it gonna trigger the random event if I go over here?

1069
02:45:13,600 --> 02:45:14,239
No, they're dead.

1070
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:19,149
That's weird.

1071
02:45:19,149 --> 02:45:19,950
That's very weird.

1072
02:45:20,750 --> 02:45:24,219
But all right, good to know.

1073
02:45:30,170 --> 02:45:31,209
So don't go in...

1074
02:45:31,209 --> 02:45:31,930
What about the bike?

1075
02:45:32,649 --> 02:45:32,969
I need...

1076
02:45:32,969 --> 02:45:33,610
I want to test something here.

1077
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:33,930
Hold on.

1078
02:45:34,649 --> 02:45:40,520
So the bike can swim, but I can't.

1079
02:45:41,239 --> 02:45:42,520
What if I go in a little deeper?

1080
02:45:42,520 --> 02:45:43,319
I'm just testing.

1081
02:45:43,959 --> 02:46:06,559
Can't get back on the bike.

1082
02:46:13,950 --> 02:46:14,639
Okay.

1083
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:28,809
I'm sure I'm not getting dragged under by something.

1084
02:46:29,370 --> 02:46:38,159
You can retrieve the bike.

1085
02:46:38,159 --> 02:46:38,879
Oh, that's good to know.

1086
02:46:41,209 --> 02:46:42,889
Taken by the ground demon.

1087
02:46:44,559 --> 02:46:46,000
I would believe that at this point.

1088
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:51,280
That's so odd.

1089
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:52,000
But why?

1090
02:46:53,129 --> 02:46:53,930
Is this clear?

1091
02:46:53,930 --> 02:46:54,569
Okay.

1092
02:46:54,569 --> 02:46:57,209
Back in the day, when you went into water,

1093
02:46:57,209 --> 02:46:58,250
you just instantly died.

1094
02:46:58,250 --> 02:47:00,250
You sunk through the earth and it instantly killed you.

1095
02:47:04,809 --> 02:47:06,250
I'm treading water.

1096
02:47:08,969 --> 02:47:11,120
Is it a weight thing?

1097
02:47:12,079 --> 02:47:18,170
I'm gonna make...

1098
02:47:18,889 --> 02:47:20,250
What the fuck, man?

1099
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:24,969
I'm not sure I want to listen.

1100
02:47:57,229 --> 02:47:58,670
I'm gonna go around.

1101
02:48:09,370 --> 02:48:12,559
In the site here instead of over at site 13.

1102
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:13,760
How do I turn this off?

1103
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:18,520
This is the weirdest, longest voicemail I've ever received.

1104
02:48:26,190 --> 02:48:28,350
What audio book did I download?

1105
02:48:31,229 --> 02:48:37,719
What is going on over here?

1106
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:43,479
Is this a random encounter?

1107
02:48:43,959 --> 02:48:48,299
You gotta take a closer look.

1108
02:48:48,299 --> 02:48:48,940
Water can?

1109
02:48:49,659 --> 02:48:52,219
What is it?

1110
02:48:52,860 --> 02:48:54,159
Upgrade?

1111
02:48:54,799 --> 02:49:00,110
No, it's tracks.

1112
02:49:00,750 --> 02:49:05,079
Let's take a look around.

1113
02:49:05,079 --> 02:49:06,350
Oh, look.

1114
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:07,069
He dropped something.

1115
02:49:07,709 --> 02:49:08,989
Let's see.

1116
02:49:09,629 --> 02:49:10,190
Drug vent.

1117
02:49:11,979 --> 02:49:12,620
Whatever they're called.

1118
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:23,239
Survival hint.

1119
02:49:23,239 --> 02:49:24,040
Plants can be easily...

1120
02:49:24,040 --> 02:49:24,840
Yeah.

1121
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:27,159
Well, where is it now?

1122
02:49:27,879 --> 02:49:29,180
We lost the trail.

1123
02:49:29,979 --> 02:49:32,280
Over here?

1124
02:49:35,319 --> 02:49:37,149
What is it?

1125
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,059
Is that him?

1126
02:49:48,059 --> 02:49:48,940
Should I be sneaking?

1127
02:49:49,899 --> 02:49:57,659
What exactly am I looking for here?

1128
02:49:58,379 --> 02:49:59,899
Am I looking for this person?

1129
02:50:02,719 --> 02:50:06,430
But what am I looking for you for?

1130
02:50:10,040 --> 02:50:10,680
Found you.

1131
02:50:10,680 --> 02:50:11,959
Another bounty.

1132
02:50:11,959 --> 02:50:13,239
Oh, it was a bounty.

1133
02:50:13,239 --> 02:50:14,120
Okay, I get it.

1134
02:50:26,239 --> 02:50:26,719
Use this.

1135
02:50:36,270 --> 02:50:37,309
Don't die from this, please.

1136
02:50:41,610 --> 02:50:42,329
Okay, well.

1137
02:50:42,329 --> 02:50:42,969
Got the bounty.

1138
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:52,139
I would take point and click Batman over this.

1139
02:50:56,329 --> 02:50:56,969
Come on.

1140
02:50:56,969 --> 02:50:57,610
Like, let...

1141
02:50:57,610 --> 02:50:59,049
Just give it a little bit.

1142
02:50:59,049 --> 02:51:00,729
We're only gonna do this for like a stream

1143
02:51:00,729 --> 02:51:01,690
or maybe another one.

1144
02:51:01,690 --> 02:51:02,250
No, we're not.

1145
02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:02,649
We'll do this...

1146
02:51:02,649 --> 02:51:04,569
This is day gone.

1147
02:51:04,569 --> 02:51:05,450
One day gone.

1148
02:51:06,010 --> 02:51:13,340
We gotta burn them out.

1149
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:14,680
Make it safer to ride.

1150
02:51:14,680 --> 02:51:17,260
What does that mean?

1151
02:51:17,260 --> 02:51:19,440
We gotta burn them out?

1152
02:51:21,399 --> 02:51:22,520
What am I burning out?

1153
02:51:23,799 --> 02:51:24,600
Oh, I missed the...

1154
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:25,399
There was three, that...

1155
02:51:25,399 --> 02:51:26,040
Three, whatever.

1156
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:27,719
I don't want to do that.

1157
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:36,110
Water!

1158
02:51:36,110 --> 02:51:36,590
It's water!

1159
02:51:36,590 --> 02:51:36,989
No, it's not.

1160
02:51:36,989 --> 02:51:37,549
It's a road.

1161
02:51:37,549 --> 02:51:37,790
Okay.

1162
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:50,569
Pulling the camera all the way out here

1163
02:51:50,569 --> 02:51:54,120
so we can wait till nighttime.

1164
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:01,950
Enter Pioneer Cemetery.

1165
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:06,639
Find the statue.

1166
02:52:20,299 --> 02:52:26,430
I can't open that.

1167
02:52:26,430 --> 02:52:27,629
I think it's gonna alert the horde.

1168
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:31,879
Don't blink.

1169
02:52:31,879 --> 02:52:45,200
Scrap.

1170
02:52:45,200 --> 02:52:49,950
Yeah.

1171
02:52:49,950 --> 02:52:51,149
Angel statue.

1172
02:52:51,149 --> 02:52:52,190
Anybody see an angel?

1173
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:56,280
Angel, angel, angel.

1174
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:58,360
I don't see an angel, but I see this.

1175
02:53:05,709 --> 02:53:06,510
Just you.

1176
02:53:06,510 --> 02:53:07,629
Oh, hey, thanks.

1177
02:53:08,270 --> 02:53:09,469
You're such a sweetie.

1178
02:53:10,030 --> 02:53:16,360
No angel here.

1179
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:20,959
No band.

1180
02:53:20,959 --> 02:53:22,159
Why would I ban you for saying that?

1181
02:53:22,159 --> 02:53:23,600
That was such a sweet thing to say.

1182
02:53:23,600 --> 02:53:24,639
Leaving the mission zone.

1183
02:53:36,139 --> 02:53:37,260
Leave the zone.

1184
02:53:37,260 --> 02:53:38,780
No, I'm not gonna leave the zone.

1185
02:53:41,049 --> 02:53:44,329
I'm enjoying my closed world game, okay?

1186
02:53:45,209 --> 02:53:56,399
Can I go in here?

1187
02:53:56,399 --> 02:54:04,909
Could it be over this way or something?

1188
02:54:04,909 --> 02:54:05,629
I don't know where it would be.

1189
02:54:09,790 --> 02:54:11,709
I have 15 minutes to switch the game.

1190
02:54:13,370 --> 02:54:13,930
There it is.

1191
02:54:13,930 --> 02:54:14,489
Is that an angel?

1192
02:54:15,049 --> 02:54:20,409
I'm not switching the game.

1193
02:54:20,409 --> 02:54:21,129
Weeping angel.

1194
02:54:21,690 --> 02:54:23,209
This has got to be it.

1195
02:54:23,209 --> 02:54:23,690
I'm not...

1196
02:54:23,690 --> 02:54:24,729
I'm playing this one.

1197
02:54:24,729 --> 02:54:26,170
Where'd you hide the stash, Leon?

1198
02:54:26,170 --> 02:54:27,450
I'm enjoying my time.

1199
02:54:29,629 --> 02:54:32,430
It's just a fun experience to check it out.

1200
02:54:32,430 --> 02:54:39,049
Oh, it...

1201
02:54:39,049 --> 02:54:40,729
Oh, I thought that was a person.

1202
02:54:40,729 --> 02:54:42,729
I was about to go up and sneak and kill this person.

1203
02:54:57,819 --> 02:54:59,020
Take the cooler.

1204
02:54:59,020 --> 02:55:00,459
What, do I got a guy's kidneys?

1205
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:12,239
Can't climb that.

1206
02:55:12,239 --> 02:55:13,280
A chopper?

1207
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:14,219
What are you talking about?

1208
02:55:14,219 --> 02:55:15,020
You can't climb this.

1209
02:55:15,020 --> 02:55:16,860
A neurochopper?

1210
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:19,819
It just buzzed right over me and acted like I wasn't even there.

1211
02:55:19,819 --> 02:55:23,950
All this time and a fed chopper shows up out of nowhere.

1212
02:55:24,670 --> 02:55:29,500
I'm gonna chase them down and I'm gonna see what the hell they're doing.

1213
02:55:37,239 --> 02:55:38,040
Get off of me.

1214
02:55:41,850 --> 02:55:43,370
Oh no, I dropped a beer.

1215
02:55:44,489 --> 02:55:47,450
I gotta get this to the tailgate party.

1216
02:55:48,010 --> 02:55:58,719
What are you doing?

1217
02:55:58,719 --> 02:55:59,120
What do you mean?

1218
02:55:59,120 --> 02:55:59,520
What?

1219
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:00,319
Get it back to the bike?

1220
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:02,799
To tie stash to bike.

1221
02:56:02,799 --> 02:56:03,040
I...

1222
02:56:16,540 --> 02:56:17,420
God damn it.

1223
02:56:18,059 --> 02:56:18,780
Wait, what?

1224
02:56:18,780 --> 02:56:19,659
Whose bike is that?

1225
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:35,239
Why?

1226
02:56:35,799 --> 02:56:36,200
Why?

1227
02:56:41,239 --> 02:56:43,479
I'm not leaving the mission zone.

1228
02:56:43,479 --> 02:56:43,719
Okay?

1229
02:56:44,600 --> 02:56:45,559
I promise you.

1230
02:57:00,059 --> 02:57:01,899
No, if it failed me I would have changed games.

1231
02:57:14,430 --> 02:57:16,350
We were so close.

1232
02:57:16,350 --> 02:57:17,469
No, come on.

1233
02:57:18,700 --> 02:57:26,809
Let me just investigate the helicopter.

1234
02:57:34,889 --> 02:57:35,530
Uh, what...

1235
02:57:35,530 --> 02:57:36,329
What helicopter?

1236
02:57:36,969 --> 02:57:43,840
They're slowing down.

1237
02:57:44,639 --> 02:57:45,760
Looks like they're stopping.

1238
02:57:46,559 --> 02:57:49,879
You're talking to me?

1239
02:57:49,879 --> 02:58:02,670
Who's keeping you hostage to play this?

1240
02:58:02,909 --> 02:58:14,350
We all know you're a comedy genius, but I feel like maybe you've tapped this game for all it's worth.

1241
02:58:15,149 --> 02:58:17,309
You guys don't have very much confidence at all.

1242
02:58:18,729 --> 02:58:20,969
Now that the military's involved, let me...

1243
02:58:20,969 --> 02:58:31,450
Hold on, let me at least just...

1244
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:34,280
Come on, this game's 60 bucks.

1245
02:58:36,750 --> 02:58:38,989
Dude, I bought the digital deluxe version, too.

1246
02:58:38,989 --> 02:58:40,809
This was like 90 bucks.

1247
02:58:41,530 --> 02:58:42,729
They're immune to attacks.

1248
02:58:45,629 --> 02:58:46,110
Okay.

1249
02:58:47,389 --> 02:58:52,319
Now I'm getting where you're coming from, guys.

1250
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:55,520
Now I'm getting where you're coming from, guys.

1251
02:58:56,750 --> 02:58:57,870
Now I see what you're getting.

1252
02:58:57,870 --> 02:58:59,069
I see what you're talking about here.

1253
02:59:00,489 --> 02:59:01,770
I didn't see it before, now I do.

1254
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:07,979
I get it now.

1255
02:59:08,540 --> 02:59:11,309
No, I didn't buy the digital deluxe.

1256
02:59:11,309 --> 02:59:12,270
Why would I ever do that?

1257
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:19,680
No, I get...

1258
02:59:19,680 --> 02:59:20,319
I know what you mean.

1259
02:59:23,979 --> 02:59:24,540
I didn't...

1260
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:24,940
For a sec...

1261
02:59:24,940 --> 02:59:27,020
Okay, I'm gonna line this up and get a collateral here.

1262
02:59:29,319 --> 02:59:30,750
Let's try to get like...

1263
02:59:30,750 --> 02:59:32,510
Let me try to get like four people in one shot.

1264
02:59:33,389 --> 02:59:48,000
Don't look over.

1265
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:48,559
What the hell are you doing?

1266
02:59:48,559 --> 02:59:49,520
Go investigate the rock.

1267
02:59:51,479 --> 02:59:52,680
I want to line up like a quad.

1268
02:59:53,399 --> 03:00:02,760
You can't use any weapons.

1269
03:00:07,659 --> 03:00:08,219
Okay.

1270
03:00:08,219 --> 03:00:08,459
I...

1271
03:00:17,180 --> 03:00:18,940
I can't kill anyone.

1272
03:00:18,940 --> 03:00:20,379
I can't attack anyone.

1273
03:00:20,379 --> 03:00:21,420
Not even stealth kill.

1274
03:00:22,059 --> 03:00:22,540
I just...

1275
03:00:34,219 --> 03:00:34,940
Oh, no.

1276
03:00:34,940 --> 03:00:40,030
It's one of these fucking clothes goddamn.

1277
03:00:50,879 --> 03:00:51,200
All right.

1278
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:51,520
All right.

1279
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:51,840
Okay.

1280
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:52,079
All right.

1281
03:00:52,079 --> 03:00:52,319
All right.

1282
03:00:52,319 --> 03:00:52,639
Listen.

1283
03:00:52,639 --> 03:00:52,959
All right.

1284
03:00:52,959 --> 03:00:53,840
Just everybody relax.

1285
03:00:54,559 --> 03:00:54,959
I know.

1286
03:00:54,959 --> 03:00:55,840
I understand.

1287
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:56,479
Just hold on.

1288
03:00:57,440 --> 03:00:57,600
I...

1289
03:00:59,200 --> 03:01:00,399
I've seen the light.

1290
03:01:00,399 --> 03:01:01,120
I've seen it.

1291
03:01:02,590 --> 03:01:03,469
Yes, I can't even...

1292
03:01:03,469 --> 03:01:05,229
I thought it meant like melee attack.

1293
03:01:05,229 --> 03:01:06,190
But what is this shit?

1294
03:01:07,500 --> 03:01:08,860
Why would you show me that thumbnail

1295
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:11,420
of a guy being stabbed in the neck for this mission?

1296
03:01:13,069 --> 03:01:13,549
What the...

1297
03:01:13,549 --> 03:01:14,030
Why?

1298
03:01:14,030 --> 03:01:15,069
I thought I saw the knife.

1299
03:01:16,110 --> 03:01:25,120
All right.

1300
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:25,360
So...

1301
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:26,399
Oh, man.

1302
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:34,879
Is this hidden?

1303
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:36,639
This counts as grass, right?

1304
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:48,959
Are you getting hungry?

1305
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:56,159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1306
03:01:56,159 --> 03:01:56,479
No.

1307
03:01:56,479 --> 03:01:57,120
Fucking dump.

1308
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,840
My flashlight is on.

1309
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:26,540
The hell am I doing?

1310
03:02:26,540 --> 03:02:27,420
Why am I reading this?

1311
03:02:39,979 --> 03:02:41,899
Where'd like the researcher go up there?

1312
03:02:41,899 --> 03:03:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1313
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:08,639
In the helicopter?

1314
03:03:08,639 --> 03:03:11,930
Do I have to take the helicopter?

1315
03:03:11,930 --> 03:03:12,409
I don't know.

1316
03:03:12,409 --> 03:03:12,729
I don't know.

1317
03:03:12,729 --> 03:03:13,049
Just throw...

1318
03:03:13,690 --> 03:03:16,649
Do I have to go in the helicopter?

1319
03:03:22,780 --> 03:03:23,340
Where is he?

1320
03:03:23,899 --> 03:03:27,930
I don't...

1321
03:03:27,930 --> 03:03:29,129
I don't know where...

1322
03:03:29,129 --> 03:03:29,530
This way?

1323
03:03:36,489 --> 03:03:37,770
In the helicopter.

1324
03:03:37,770 --> 03:03:38,250
Are you sure?

1325
03:03:38,969 --> 03:03:39,770
I don't know if you're sure about that.

1326
03:03:39,770 --> 03:03:40,010
Hold on.

1327
03:03:40,010 --> 03:03:40,250
Wait.

1328
03:03:46,110 --> 03:03:46,350
One.

1329
03:03:47,479 --> 03:03:47,719
Two.

1330
03:03:48,280 --> 03:04:00,479
I'm luring him.

1331
03:04:00,479 --> 03:04:02,000
I'm luring him to me.

1332
03:04:09,079 --> 03:04:10,600
Anybody hear any sound?

1333
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:11,079
Helicopter.

1334
03:04:11,079 --> 03:04:11,239
Go.

1335
03:04:11,879 --> 03:04:14,110
You guys lied.

1336
03:04:38,729 --> 03:04:40,409
Other side of the helicopter?

1337
03:04:40,409 --> 03:04:45,040
Oh, fuck.

1338
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:57,680
I'm just waiting for it to be like...

1339
03:04:58,319 --> 03:05:17,399
I'm sorry.

1340
03:05:17,399 --> 03:05:17,879
Okay.

1341
03:05:17,879 --> 03:05:18,760
Well, I just tried.

1342
03:05:28,409 --> 03:05:29,129
Other side.

1343
03:05:29,770 --> 03:05:30,170
Stop.

1344
03:05:30,809 --> 03:05:44,729
It's not gonna...

1345
03:05:44,729 --> 03:05:45,770
There's no alarm in there.

1346
03:05:47,690 --> 03:05:48,729
It's at the back.

1347
03:05:48,729 --> 03:05:49,690
It's not at the back.

1348
03:05:49,690 --> 03:05:50,409
That's a tail.

1349
03:05:51,709 --> 03:05:54,190
I have to find the guy in the white suit.

1350
03:05:56,719 --> 03:05:57,200
It's this way.

1351
03:05:57,200 --> 03:05:57,760
You guys lied.

1352
03:05:57,760 --> 03:05:58,399
I have to just go this way.

1353
03:05:58,399 --> 03:05:58,799
Here we go.

1354
03:05:58,799 --> 03:05:58,959
One.

1355
03:05:58,959 --> 03:05:59,200
Two.

1356
03:05:59,200 --> 03:05:59,440
Three.

1357
03:05:59,440 --> 03:05:59,600
Go.

1358
03:06:00,399 --> 03:06:00,719
Wait.

1359
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:22,299
Where'd the doctor go?

1360
03:06:22,299 --> 03:06:22,620
This way.

1361
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:23,180
Somewhere, right?

1362
03:06:23,819 --> 03:06:25,020
Oh my god damn it.

1363
03:06:25,739 --> 03:06:32,440
If I swear to god, if I have to go to the tail...

1364
03:06:35,850 --> 03:06:36,889
Is it that guy right there?

1365
03:06:50,520 --> 03:06:51,479
Down that way.

1366
03:06:51,479 --> 03:06:56,299
There were people talking right next to the helicopter.

1367
03:06:56,299 --> 03:06:56,780
Yeah, that's...

1368
03:06:56,780 --> 03:07:00,170
I know, but I feel like...

1369
03:07:00,170 --> 03:07:01,290
Can I just go down that way?

1370
03:07:02,010 --> 03:07:09,280
Please stay low.

1371
03:07:09,280 --> 03:07:09,680
Stay low.

1372
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:10,159
Stay low.

1373
03:07:10,159 --> 03:07:10,799
Okay, stay low.

1374
03:07:10,799 --> 03:07:11,520
What are you talking about?

1375
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:11,840
I am.

1376
03:07:20,010 --> 03:07:20,489
Do I...

1377
03:07:20,489 --> 03:07:21,450
I feel like I have to...

1378
03:07:21,450 --> 03:07:22,090
Hold on.

1379
03:07:22,090 --> 03:07:25,309
Let me see if everyone's lying to me.

1380
03:07:26,110 --> 03:07:44,590
You have to enter the helicopter from the top.

1381
03:07:45,149 --> 03:07:46,270
It's not the helicopter.

1382
03:07:48,700 --> 03:07:50,860
They went uphill on that west side.

1383
03:07:50,860 --> 03:07:52,700
Yeah, like up here, right?

1384
03:07:53,579 --> 03:07:55,229
Hold on.

1385
03:07:55,229 --> 03:07:58,920
Up like this way?

1386
03:07:59,719 --> 03:08:00,280
No, that's right.

1387
03:08:05,209 --> 03:08:06,170
West, not north.

1388
03:08:10,120 --> 03:08:10,760
Okay, I'm gonna go...

1389
03:08:22,600 --> 03:08:23,559
Just go west.

1390
03:08:23,559 --> 03:08:24,360
I'm just gonna go west.

1391
03:08:24,360 --> 03:08:25,959
I'm just gonna be tactical about this and just go...

1392
03:08:39,500 --> 03:08:39,659
What?

1393
03:08:39,659 --> 03:08:40,459
We need something to move.

1394
03:08:41,790 --> 03:08:42,590
Hide this bunch quick!

1395
03:09:11,069 --> 03:09:11,309
Up here.

1396
03:09:15,709 --> 03:09:17,149
Go north-south.

1397
03:09:17,709 --> 03:09:22,280
And god damn force stealth game.

1398
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:25,239
Oh, there is nothing worse.

1399
03:09:27,260 --> 03:09:27,659
I'm gonna...

1400
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:36,729
I gotta send them that way.

1401
03:09:38,059 --> 03:09:39,340
You, like, go over there.

1402
03:10:16,219 --> 03:10:17,659
I was going the right way.

1403
03:10:17,659 --> 03:10:18,299
I was.

1404
03:10:18,299 --> 03:10:19,739
Everybody just got in my head.

1405
03:10:19,739 --> 03:10:21,100
I was going the right way.

1406
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:22,860
I was going past the helicopter.

1407
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:25,280
I was doing it correct.

1408
03:10:25,280 --> 03:10:28,719
And everyone says, no, you're doing it wrong.

1409
03:10:28,719 --> 03:10:29,440
I was going...

1410
03:10:29,440 --> 03:10:30,399
And then we're at all...

1411
03:10:30,399 --> 03:10:32,479
I went all the way back around the circle.

1412
03:10:32,479 --> 03:10:33,520
It's over here.

1413
03:10:35,340 --> 03:10:36,139
It's up there.

1414
03:10:53,370 --> 03:10:55,899
Please don't turn around!

1415
03:10:55,899 --> 03:10:57,819
Don't turn around!

1416
03:10:57,819 --> 03:10:59,000
I made it.

1417
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:00,200
Okay, now it's up here.

1418
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:00,920
They went this way.

1419
03:11:04,040 --> 03:11:04,520
Oh!

1420
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:22,959
Get the fuck out of here!

1421
03:11:22,959 --> 03:11:24,079
Leave me alone!

1422
03:11:24,079 --> 03:11:28,750
They went right here.

1423
03:11:28,750 --> 03:11:38,040
Oh my god!

1424
03:11:38,040 --> 03:11:39,079
Where do I go?

1425
03:11:39,879 --> 03:11:40,200
No!

1426
03:11:40,840 --> 03:11:41,159
What?

1427
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:44,760
I...

1428
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:45,639
There's nobody here.

1429
03:11:50,969 --> 03:11:52,329
Where is this guy?

1430
03:12:00,360 --> 03:12:02,600
I already went to the helicopter, like, three times.

1431
03:12:03,319 --> 03:12:08,649
Is it over...

1432
03:12:08,649 --> 03:12:09,850
There's a car over here.

1433
03:12:09,850 --> 03:12:10,489
Is it this way?

1434
03:12:11,209 --> 03:12:13,229
I think I was supposed to be tailing somebody.

1435
03:12:15,159 --> 03:12:17,319
Oh my god!

1436
03:12:20,430 --> 03:12:21,870
This fucking cave!

1437
03:12:23,120 --> 03:12:24,319
No, there's no cave!

1438
03:12:24,959 --> 03:12:34,649
I'm one of those who'll fucking distract you.

1439
03:12:36,379 --> 03:12:37,100
In the water?

1440
03:12:38,889 --> 03:12:39,930
Like, down there?

1441
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:43,639
I went over there.

1442
03:12:43,639 --> 03:12:44,280
It was nothing.

1443
03:12:45,440 --> 03:12:47,200
Is it like a little spot I can go in here?

1444
03:12:50,010 --> 03:12:50,729
Okay, hold on.

1445
03:12:52,559 --> 03:12:53,840
But this just goes back up!

1446
03:12:54,639 --> 03:12:59,180
Somebody open up a goddamn game, Janie.

1447
03:13:24,510 --> 03:13:25,950
The map has a quest point.

1448
03:13:34,159 --> 03:13:34,799
But what?

1449
03:13:35,680 --> 03:13:35,920
No.

1450
03:13:37,479 --> 03:13:39,399
This is out of the mission zone!

1451
03:13:39,399 --> 03:13:40,680
This is out of bounds!

1452
03:13:43,180 --> 03:13:45,420
The mission ends if I walk out here!

1453
03:13:45,420 --> 03:13:59,920
Hold on.

1454
03:13:59,920 --> 03:14:01,760
For start the mission, don't throw any rocks.

1455
03:14:01,760 --> 03:14:03,680
Just follow the guy in the white suit.

1456
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:22,059
I just follow the guy in the white suit.

1457
03:14:23,180 --> 03:14:23,659
Quit the game.

1458
03:14:23,659 --> 03:14:24,459
No, no, no.

1459
03:14:24,459 --> 03:14:25,979
I can't let it be me.

1460
03:14:25,979 --> 03:14:26,860
I have to win.

1461
03:14:26,860 --> 03:14:33,500
Throw rocks at the guy with the suit.

1462
03:14:33,500 --> 03:14:36,700
All right, where...

1463
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:37,340
Hold on, wait, wait.

1464
03:14:37,340 --> 03:14:38,059
But where...

1465
03:14:38,059 --> 03:14:39,659
Where's the guy in the suit?

1466
03:14:40,540 --> 03:14:41,579
It keeps spawning me.

1467
03:14:41,579 --> 03:14:42,780
It's soft locking me here.

1468
03:14:44,959 --> 03:14:46,000
Where is this person?

1469
03:14:59,579 --> 03:15:01,020
The whole game is gray.

1470
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:02,139
I can't see anything.

1471
03:15:14,829 --> 03:15:15,549
Go west?

1472
03:15:16,350 --> 03:15:17,709
Like, that's...

1473
03:15:18,829 --> 03:15:19,790
Okay, here I go.

1474
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:29,209
This is gonna lead back up to the spawn.

1475
03:15:34,139 --> 03:15:35,420
Up the hill with the fence.

1476
03:15:35,420 --> 03:15:37,180
No, that's bullshit because look!

1477
03:15:37,819 --> 03:15:39,260
This is the start of the game!

1478
03:15:45,840 --> 03:15:47,520
This is the beginning of the game!

1479
03:16:32,479 --> 03:16:33,360
Go north.

1480
03:16:33,360 --> 03:16:34,079
Go north.

1481
03:16:34,079 --> 03:16:36,639
You went everywhere but the right direction.

1482
03:16:36,639 --> 03:16:39,600
Why do I have to follow the straight line path

1483
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:41,760
in an open world game?

1484
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:48,520
I can go left from here.

1485
03:16:52,670 --> 03:16:53,549
The other fence.

1486
03:16:58,719 --> 03:16:59,200
Look...

1487
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:00,639
I mean, like, you're talking about over here.

1488
03:17:00,639 --> 03:17:02,079
Let me get the fucking binoculars here.

1489
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:03,360
Like, he marked this guy.

1490
03:17:04,159 --> 03:17:06,329
Like, you're talking about this way.

1491
03:17:06,889 --> 03:17:13,000
What do you mean the other left?

1492
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:13,719
This is left!

1493
03:17:17,100 --> 03:17:17,500
This way.

1494
03:17:17,500 --> 03:17:19,420
Like, just go straight this way.

1495
03:17:19,420 --> 03:17:21,500
Okay, where that little pixel is pointing

1496
03:17:21,500 --> 03:17:22,780
is where you want me to go, right?

1497
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:30,620
All right, okay, hold on, wait.

1498
03:17:30,620 --> 03:17:32,459
I'm looking at the helicopter right now.

1499
03:17:32,459 --> 03:17:34,139
To the left of this helicopter

1500
03:17:34,139 --> 03:17:36,059
or to the right of this helicopter?

1501
03:17:41,180 --> 03:17:42,459
Hard left.

1502
03:17:42,459 --> 03:17:44,030
So this way.

1503
03:17:46,649 --> 03:17:47,129
I don't know.

1504
03:17:47,850 --> 03:17:49,770
Yes, no, left, the back.

1505
03:17:49,770 --> 03:17:50,969
Left, left of the back.

1506
03:17:51,770 --> 03:17:53,680
There's a cave right next to you.

1507
03:17:54,479 --> 03:17:58,040
Where is there a cave?

1508
03:17:59,079 --> 03:18:00,040
There's a cave.

1509
03:18:01,079 --> 03:18:02,440
Wait, the cave.

1510
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:03,559
I don't see a cave.

1511
03:18:08,280 --> 03:18:09,000
I'm going for the...

1512
03:18:09,000 --> 03:18:09,639
I'm going this way.

1513
03:18:09,639 --> 03:18:10,440
Everyone said this way.

1514
03:18:10,440 --> 03:18:10,920
Hard left.

1515
03:18:11,559 --> 03:18:27,290
Give me, give me, give me!

1516
03:18:27,290 --> 03:18:31,629
There's nobody in here!

1517
03:18:32,190 --> 03:18:36,559
There's nobody inside the cave!

1518
03:18:37,440 --> 03:18:49,850
There is!

1519
03:18:49,850 --> 03:18:50,489
There's a scientist!

1520
03:18:54,489 --> 03:18:56,010
Going too far from the researchers!

1521
03:18:56,010 --> 03:18:56,969
What are you talking about?

1522
03:19:01,239 --> 03:19:01,799
He's from...

1523
03:19:04,319 --> 03:19:08,799
I've been...

1524
03:19:09,680 --> 03:19:11,600
I've been far away from the researchers.

1525
03:19:26,200 --> 03:19:30,840
Be careful!

1526
03:19:39,719 --> 03:19:41,639
Wait, now it wants me to clear the camp?

1527
03:19:42,600 --> 03:19:43,559
I have to sit here and listen.

1528
03:20:04,239 --> 03:20:11,920
No, stop it.

1529
03:20:11,920 --> 03:20:12,479
Just let it in.

1530
03:20:25,770 --> 03:20:31,530
I spent a whole day on this mission.

1531
03:20:31,530 --> 03:20:32,250
A whole day going...

1532
03:20:36,030 --> 03:20:38,350
Follow the researcher to continue eavesdropping.

1533
03:20:38,909 --> 03:20:40,350
Stay close and out of sight.

1534
03:20:40,350 --> 03:20:41,309
Oh, come on!

1535
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:49,979
I really don't think anyone,

1536
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:52,239
and I mean anyone,

1537
03:20:52,799 --> 03:20:54,799
that has ever played a video game

1538
03:20:54,799 --> 03:20:56,879
in their whole life thinks that...

1539
03:20:56,879 --> 03:20:57,379
No!

1540
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:00,159
Thinks this is fun!

1541
03:21:07,920 --> 03:21:08,719
Following...

1542
03:21:08,719 --> 03:21:11,280
Forced stealth follow and listen to somebody talk.

1543
03:21:12,159 --> 03:21:13,120
Nobody thinks...

1544
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:14,000
I don't want to listen to this!

1545
03:21:20,489 --> 03:21:23,209
We have like decades of video game research

1546
03:21:23,209 --> 03:21:23,690
and knowledge.

1547
03:21:26,520 --> 03:21:27,719
They made whole games...

1548
03:21:28,440 --> 03:21:29,879
Some of the Assassin's Creed games

1549
03:21:29,879 --> 03:21:31,639
were this mission's the whole game.

1550
03:21:31,639 --> 03:21:32,280
And everyone was like,

1551
03:21:32,280 --> 03:21:33,399
all right, I'm going to go to the escort,

1552
03:21:33,399 --> 03:21:34,760
walk behind them and listen to the mission.

1553
03:22:01,290 --> 03:22:02,649
Now, I can stomach this,

1554
03:22:02,649 --> 03:22:03,610
but I can't...

1555
03:22:04,409 --> 03:22:05,610
They have to have forced stealth

1556
03:22:05,610 --> 03:22:07,680
because you have to listen to this.

1557
03:22:07,680 --> 03:22:09,680
You can't just throw an axe at somebody's head.

1558
03:22:11,840 --> 03:22:12,799
We have to hear this!

1559
03:22:22,590 --> 03:22:23,629
We got to go right here.

1560
03:22:37,799 --> 03:22:39,959
Dude, I'm going to throw a rock as hard as I can

1561
03:22:39,959 --> 03:22:40,760
to make sure it's in space.

1562
03:22:51,559 --> 03:22:52,360
Quit, quit, no!

1563
03:22:54,909 --> 03:22:55,469
No quitting!

1564
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:00,540
Hurry up, go back to DOS.

1565
03:23:07,559 --> 03:23:08,520
No, he's not seeing me.

1566
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:13,799
That light is really close.

1567
03:23:13,799 --> 03:23:14,600
Please don't see me.

1568
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:17,159
Okay, return to your bike.

1569
03:23:17,159 --> 03:23:18,200
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

1570
03:23:18,200 --> 03:23:19,000
Get me to buy a bike.

1571
03:23:22,299 --> 03:23:23,659
What's the fastest way to get over there?

1572
03:23:23,659 --> 03:23:24,540
I didn't mark anybody.

1573
03:23:27,930 --> 03:23:28,889
Um, shit.

1574
03:23:30,489 --> 03:23:31,690
No, con!

1575
03:23:31,690 --> 03:23:32,190
Con!

1576
03:23:33,290 --> 03:23:34,489
Why is this guy just here?

1577
03:23:38,750 --> 03:23:40,110
Don't make me do it all again.

1578
03:23:40,909 --> 03:23:43,559
Don't make me do it again.

1579
03:23:46,430 --> 03:23:46,909
Thank you.

1580
03:23:47,709 --> 03:23:59,280
You saw that.

1581
03:24:03,790 --> 03:24:04,829
You saw me do it.

1582
03:24:23,479 --> 03:24:30,000
Give me back my bike.

1583
03:24:30,719 --> 03:24:32,250
Give me back to the bike.

1584
03:24:33,559 --> 03:24:34,059
Oops!

1585
03:24:41,549 --> 03:24:42,049
Oh no.

1586
03:24:57,129 --> 03:25:08,350
Okay, come on.

1587
03:25:08,350 --> 03:25:09,469
Give me to the bike.

1588
03:25:09,469 --> 03:25:16,059
No, he's going to come over here too, isn't he?

1589
03:25:18,079 --> 03:25:20,079
You stay all the fucking way over there.

1590
03:25:20,079 --> 03:25:20,719
For God's sakes.

1591
03:25:27,149 --> 03:25:28,110
Thank God, get me out.

1592
03:25:34,940 --> 03:25:38,250
Oh my God, it only took like 40 minutes.

1593
03:25:38,250 --> 03:25:39,370
Holy shit.

1594
03:25:39,370 --> 03:25:58,110
You better switch to a better game or no dessert for you.

1595
03:25:58,989 --> 03:26:04,280
Oh, fuck all the quitters.

1596
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:05,879
All right, you know what?

1597
03:26:05,879 --> 03:26:12,000
That one guy, you're right.

1598
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:12,879
Why is he still playing?

1599
03:26:12,879 --> 03:26:13,760
He admitted it's not.

1600
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:15,040
I never said it wasn't fun.

1601
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:17,440
I just said why would they do missions like this?

1602
03:26:18,079 --> 03:26:22,059
Unlocked.

1603
03:26:22,059 --> 03:26:23,260
Crafting recipe.

1604
03:26:23,260 --> 03:26:24,139
Residue bolt.

1605
03:26:24,860 --> 03:26:26,590
All right, get me out of here.

1606
03:26:28,799 --> 03:26:29,600
Turn on each other.

1607
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:30,100
Cool.

1608
03:26:30,719 --> 03:26:32,479
All right, let's go back in the game.

1609
03:26:32,479 --> 03:26:33,680
I got to deliver my...

1610
03:26:34,639 --> 03:26:35,440
I got to deliver this.

1611
03:26:36,319 --> 03:26:37,610
New skill.

1612
03:26:37,610 --> 03:26:38,569
Finally, we got a skill point.

1613
03:26:38,569 --> 03:26:39,129
Check this out.

1614
03:26:40,190 --> 03:26:41,309
Probably didn't even think it was...

1615
03:26:41,309 --> 03:26:42,030
You're going to see this.

1616
03:26:42,670 --> 03:26:54,479
Ability to activate focused aim.

1617
03:26:56,319 --> 03:26:58,399
Move and aim a ranged weapon with more precision.

1618
03:26:59,120 --> 03:27:02,319
Ability to follow a melee attack with a ranged attack for massive damage.

1619
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:06,170
Increase the time that icons display in survival vision.

1620
03:27:07,389 --> 03:27:08,829
Plants are displayed on the minimap.

1621
03:27:09,389 --> 03:27:11,500
Provides a chance to retrieve some bolts that have been...

1622
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:24,829
I mean, I guess this one.

1623
03:27:25,389 --> 03:27:25,790
Oh yeah.

1624
03:27:27,920 --> 03:27:28,319
This one.

1625
03:27:38,780 --> 03:27:39,579
It's sponsored.

1626
03:27:39,579 --> 03:27:41,180
This is not a sponsored stream.

1627
03:27:41,180 --> 03:27:41,659
I would have...

1628
03:27:41,659 --> 03:27:43,260
My contract would have been ripped in half.

1629
03:27:45,690 --> 03:27:46,190
Sarah.

1630
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:51,040
That phone call in the beginning of the stream would have been from the sponsor.

1631
03:27:51,760 --> 03:27:58,120
We're just calling to let you know that the contract's terminated.

1632
03:27:58,920 --> 03:28:01,239
You said, fuck this dumb stealth mission.

1633
03:28:01,239 --> 03:28:02,440
And you laughed at something.

1634
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:03,500
Hello.

1635
03:28:33,659 --> 03:28:37,420
You should play Photoshop.

1636
03:28:37,420 --> 03:28:39,180
What do you mean Photoshop?

1637
03:28:40,059 --> 03:28:44,090
I don't know how to use Photoshop that well.

1638
03:28:59,899 --> 03:29:01,180
He doesn't come off the bike.

1639
03:29:02,989 --> 03:29:04,510
Fuck you, buddy.

1640
03:29:04,510 --> 03:29:05,629
I got something for you.

1641
03:29:06,760 --> 03:29:07,399
Smile!

1642
03:29:10,110 --> 03:29:10,610
No!

1643
03:29:10,989 --> 03:29:11,489
Please!

1644
03:29:18,270 --> 03:29:19,389
Do not Bioshock!

1645
03:29:19,950 --> 03:29:46,520
We're good.

1646
03:29:46,520 --> 03:29:47,399
Microsoft Office.

1647
03:29:47,399 --> 03:29:48,440
I'm always just writing paper.

1648
03:29:53,100 --> 03:29:54,059
No, come on.

1649
03:29:57,850 --> 03:29:59,209
Come on, just give it a chance.

1650
03:29:59,930 --> 03:30:02,040
Clear?

1651
03:30:02,040 --> 03:30:02,840
Is there a hostage?

1652
03:30:03,559 --> 03:30:10,899
Okay.

1653
03:30:20,520 --> 03:30:21,020
No!

1654
03:30:21,959 --> 03:30:31,000
I can't do it.

1655
03:30:31,000 --> 03:30:31,479
I can't.

1656
03:30:31,479 --> 03:30:32,200
It doesn't work.

1657
03:30:39,389 --> 03:30:40,190
What the hell?

1658
03:30:40,190 --> 03:30:41,790
No, I want you to throw the pipe bomb.

1659
03:30:45,049 --> 03:30:45,549
Great.

1660
03:30:54,860 --> 03:30:56,139
No, I can't quit.

1661
03:30:56,139 --> 03:30:56,780
I can't quit.

1662
03:30:56,780 --> 03:30:58,299
We have like three and a half hours in.

1663
03:30:58,299 --> 03:30:59,100
Come on.

1664
03:30:59,100 --> 03:31:02,379
This stream's only going to be like another three hours long.

1665
03:31:02,379 --> 03:31:03,260
Four hours.

1666
03:31:03,260 --> 03:31:04,940
We got to stick with this.

1667
03:31:04,940 --> 03:31:14,379
It's the only time you're ever going to see this game.

1668
03:31:14,940 --> 03:31:17,180
Don't you want to know if you want to buy it?

1669
03:31:18,059 --> 03:31:20,299
I went right through that log.

1670
03:31:20,940 --> 03:31:21,440
Shit.

1671
03:31:22,299 --> 03:31:33,500
I already know.

1672
03:31:33,500 --> 03:31:34,540
I already know.

1673
03:31:34,540 --> 03:31:35,020
Do you though?

1674
03:31:35,020 --> 03:31:36,940
But what if like something happens and you go,

1675
03:31:36,940 --> 03:31:38,700
oh shit, that sounds like fun.

1676
03:31:49,930 --> 03:31:51,450
Yeah, let me just...

1677
03:31:51,450 --> 03:31:52,409
This is what we're doing.

1678
03:31:52,409 --> 03:31:52,889
Don't worry.

1679
03:31:52,889 --> 03:31:53,850
I'll be live tomorrow.

1680
03:31:53,850 --> 03:31:56,329
If you don't want to see it then it's all good.

1681
03:31:56,329 --> 03:31:57,450
We're just having fun.

1682
03:31:58,090 --> 03:32:10,030
What is on the other side?

1683
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:13,200
I'm having a fun time.

1684
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:14,700
I'm doing fine.

1685
03:32:14,700 --> 03:32:15,579
I'm having fun.

1686
03:32:15,579 --> 03:32:16,860
Raider camp.

1687
03:32:16,860 --> 03:32:18,940
What you mean sons of bitches, aren't you?

1688
03:32:19,899 --> 03:32:20,860
As you said this week.

1689
03:32:21,819 --> 03:32:24,639
I mean guys, I'm being real.

1690
03:32:24,639 --> 03:32:25,360
It's either this...

1691
03:32:26,079 --> 03:32:26,579
Or...

1692
03:32:29,840 --> 03:32:31,120
No, I can't even say that.

1693
03:32:31,680 --> 03:32:33,840
Because we're doing that on Sunday.

1694
03:32:42,110 --> 03:32:42,750
Or what?

1695
03:32:42,750 --> 03:32:43,870
Say it to everyone.

1696
03:32:43,870 --> 03:32:44,590
It's freaking out.

1697
03:32:45,229 --> 03:32:47,950
I was going to say Mario Yahtzee, but that's...

1698
03:32:48,829 --> 03:32:50,479
Shouldn't have said it.

1699
03:33:03,530 --> 03:33:04,250
Don't quit.

1700
03:33:04,250 --> 03:33:06,809
No, we'll play Mario Yahtzee on Sunday.

1701
03:33:08,319 --> 03:33:09,920
Well, like, let me...

1702
03:33:09,920 --> 03:33:10,719
Hold on, let me like...

1703
03:33:11,680 --> 03:33:19,659
Move the car.

1704
03:33:20,299 --> 03:33:25,690
Finally, some decent food.

1705
03:33:30,459 --> 03:33:32,219
One guy said don't quit.

1706
03:33:32,219 --> 03:33:32,719
That's true.

1707
03:33:33,420 --> 03:33:35,850
And plus this was what I wanted to do today.

1708
03:33:36,889 --> 03:33:37,850
Look, I'll think about it, okay?

1709
03:33:37,850 --> 03:33:38,649
Here's what's going to happen.

1710
03:33:39,290 --> 03:33:41,389
We're going to play this a little bit more.

1711
03:33:41,389 --> 03:33:42,270
And I'm going to go pee.

1712
03:33:42,909 --> 03:33:43,709
It's three and a half hours.

1713
03:33:43,709 --> 03:33:44,270
I haven't peed yet.

1714
03:33:44,270 --> 03:33:45,309
It's a world record.

1715
03:33:52,750 --> 03:33:53,389
Nobody said that?

1716
03:33:53,389 --> 03:33:53,950
Yes, they did.

1717
03:33:53,950 --> 03:33:54,510
Scroll back.

1718
03:33:55,399 --> 03:33:57,399
Just go up on your mouse.

1719
03:34:09,079 --> 03:34:10,280
Drive five feet.

1720
03:34:10,280 --> 03:34:11,079
Move another car.

1721
03:34:18,110 --> 03:34:20,430
Line it up, line it up, line it up, line it up.

1722
03:34:20,430 --> 03:34:20,829
Fuck!

1723
03:34:20,829 --> 03:34:21,790
I had it too.

1724
03:34:21,790 --> 03:34:22,290
Oh!

1725
03:34:22,989 --> 03:34:23,870
I'm angry about that.

1726
03:34:36,920 --> 03:34:37,559
What?

1727
03:34:37,559 --> 03:34:41,559
All right, bye.

1728
03:34:42,520 --> 03:34:42,920
I guess.

1729
03:34:44,780 --> 03:34:45,340
Pee stream?

1730
03:34:45,340 --> 03:34:46,540
Oh, you're going to get a pee here.

1731
03:34:46,540 --> 03:34:47,899
No, not on stream, but I'm going to go.

1732
03:34:51,100 --> 03:34:52,459
No, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.

1733
03:34:58,010 --> 03:34:59,049
Can I not move this car?

1734
03:34:59,690 --> 03:35:02,680
I can't move this car.

1735
03:35:03,319 --> 03:35:04,280
No, that's not true.

1736
03:35:04,920 --> 03:35:16,799
I can't move this car.

1737
03:35:16,799 --> 03:35:18,479
No, I definitely can.

1738
03:35:19,120 --> 03:35:20,670
I was going to say no.

1739
03:35:20,670 --> 03:35:21,870
Obstructed five bike.

1740
03:35:24,219 --> 03:35:25,260
No shit, huh?

1741
03:35:26,059 --> 03:35:37,069
At least let us play with smart click.

1742
03:35:37,790 --> 03:35:42,459
I'll think about it after I pee.

1743
03:36:02,559 --> 03:36:03,600
Think faster.

1744
03:36:04,239 --> 03:36:15,739
Okay, if there's another roadblock, I'm going to quit again.

1745
03:36:20,139 --> 03:36:22,010
Good, good.

1746
03:36:26,829 --> 03:36:27,870
I'm out of gas.

1747
03:36:28,590 --> 03:36:37,239
No roadblock.

1748
03:36:37,239 --> 03:36:37,959
We get to stay.

1749
03:36:42,280 --> 03:36:43,799
Let me at least turn this shit in.

1750
03:36:53,399 --> 03:36:53,719
Gas?

1751
03:37:12,329 --> 03:37:14,399
Camp was wiped out.

1752
03:37:14,399 --> 03:37:15,840
No, I know that, but I heard.

1753
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:16,239
Okay, look.

1754
03:37:19,159 --> 03:37:20,120
What's what are you doing?

1755
03:37:22,059 --> 03:37:22,860
Why is it doing that?

1756
03:37:24,459 --> 03:37:27,239
Wait, wait, you're into their LZ?

1757
03:37:27,239 --> 03:37:27,719
What the?

1758
03:37:27,719 --> 03:37:30,200
Just listen.

1759
03:37:30,200 --> 03:37:34,750
How do I call the bike?

1760
03:37:34,750 --> 03:37:35,229
Recover.

1761
03:37:36,030 --> 03:37:37,549
Bike is too far to recover.

1762
03:37:45,549 --> 03:37:46,750
Oh, we're losing internet here.

1763
03:37:48,540 --> 03:37:51,049
Hey, get some sleep.

1764
03:37:51,610 --> 03:37:52,250
D, get out.

1765
03:37:52,809 --> 03:38:04,760
This is Radio Free Oregon.

1766
03:38:05,639 --> 03:38:06,280
Walking.

1767
03:38:09,959 --> 03:38:11,559
Check the nerd camp for fuel.

1768
03:38:13,959 --> 03:38:14,840
It's too far now.

1769
03:38:17,520 --> 03:38:18,079
It's too far.

1770
03:38:28,159 --> 03:38:29,360
Look at the gas back there.

1771
03:38:31,799 --> 03:38:32,920
Just turn around, I can coast.

1772
03:38:35,420 --> 03:38:37,420
Uh-oh, boring, boring, boring streamer.

1773
03:38:38,059 --> 03:38:40,040
No, just wait, wait, just wait.

1774
03:38:40,520 --> 03:38:41,159
Something funny could happen.

1775
03:38:41,159 --> 03:38:41,639
Right here, ready?

1776
03:38:55,639 --> 03:38:58,360
Oh shit, not even the funny music will make them laugh.

1777
03:39:17,319 --> 03:39:17,959
What?

1778
03:39:17,959 --> 03:39:19,069
I just want gas.

1779
03:39:19,069 --> 03:39:20,270
I don't care about anything else here.

1780
03:39:22,680 --> 03:39:28,350
One of these days I'm going to need to turn the stream on during this.

1781
03:39:28,989 --> 03:39:30,430
And I'm just going to be making balloon animals.

1782
03:39:31,149 --> 03:39:32,940
Hey, the game sucks.

1783
03:39:32,940 --> 03:39:33,579
Like boring.

1784
03:39:33,579 --> 03:39:34,459
Come on, play something else.

1785
03:39:34,459 --> 03:39:35,659
Oh shit, I'm going to turn the camera on.

1786
03:39:35,659 --> 03:39:37,979
Just start making fucking dogs and stuff.

1787
03:39:44,379 --> 03:39:45,739
Find the fuse.

1788
03:39:46,620 --> 03:39:50,040
I just want gas.

1789
03:39:50,760 --> 03:39:58,000
I don't even know how to make balloon animals.

1790
03:39:58,559 --> 03:40:01,069
Thank God.

1791
03:40:02,059 --> 03:40:03,020
All right, the stream can go on.

1792
03:40:05,979 --> 03:40:07,420
It's right there, just give it to me.

1793
03:40:07,420 --> 03:40:10,280
It's right there, just give it to me.

1794
03:40:13,559 --> 03:40:14,520
I can see it.

1795
03:40:14,520 --> 03:40:15,159
It's right here.

1796
03:40:15,719 --> 03:40:16,600
That's gas, right?

1797
03:40:19,309 --> 03:40:21,149
That's gas, gasoline.

1798
03:40:21,149 --> 03:40:21,709
I'll take it.

1799
03:40:22,270 --> 03:40:36,360
You guys actually have pretty good patience.

1800
03:40:36,360 --> 03:40:37,399
I will give you that.

1801
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:42,379
We're going for about four hours.

1802
03:40:43,020 --> 03:40:43,979
But it's been fun.

1803
03:40:44,540 --> 03:40:46,139
You guys are really patient.

1804
03:40:48,959 --> 03:40:49,440
What do you mean?

1805
03:40:49,440 --> 03:40:49,760
How?

1806
03:40:49,760 --> 03:40:50,559
How are they patient?

1807
03:40:50,559 --> 03:40:51,120
No, we're not.

1808
03:40:51,120 --> 03:40:51,680
No, we don't.

1809
03:40:52,239 --> 03:40:54,090
I'm trying to give you a compliment.

1810
03:40:54,090 --> 03:40:54,569
Now my turn.

1811
03:40:54,569 --> 03:40:54,969
Give me one.

1812
03:40:54,969 --> 03:40:55,450
What do you think?

1813
03:40:58,329 --> 03:40:59,549
Your turn.

1814
03:41:01,950 --> 03:41:13,739
Your infestation zone.

1815
03:41:23,690 --> 03:41:24,170
Jump!

1816
03:41:24,170 --> 03:41:25,049
A cool jump.

1817
03:41:40,670 --> 03:41:42,190
How did you get down here?

1818
03:42:14,590 --> 03:42:15,309
God damn it.

1819
03:42:16,030 --> 03:42:18,829
My frame rate dropped to like 20 frames a second.

1820
03:42:18,829 --> 03:42:19,950
I didn't make the jump.

1821
03:42:19,950 --> 03:42:22,760
Okay, I'm holding right trigger right now.

1822
03:42:24,120 --> 03:42:25,319
If I don't make it this time.

1823
03:42:26,489 --> 03:42:27,450
See this like slow down.

1824
03:42:27,450 --> 03:42:29,290
Is it not catching my frames or something?

1825
03:42:29,290 --> 03:42:30,489
No, I'm going to make it this time.

1826
03:42:31,690 --> 03:42:32,250
Why would?

1827
03:42:32,809 --> 03:42:33,049
Why?

1828
03:42:36,920 --> 03:42:37,799
No way.

1829
03:42:49,520 --> 03:42:51,440
You tell me I can't make that jump.

1830
03:42:51,440 --> 03:42:53,040
It's like 15 feet.

1831
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:54,479
It's not even 10 feet.

1832
03:42:54,479 --> 03:42:55,520
I'm hitting that jump.

1833
03:42:57,340 --> 03:42:58,139
I'll show you how.

1834
03:42:59,850 --> 03:43:01,370
You think I give a fuck right now?

1835
03:43:01,370 --> 03:43:03,129
We're hitting that jump and I'm going over it.

1836
03:43:03,770 --> 03:43:17,840
This nesting zone.

1837
03:43:28,670 --> 03:43:29,149
Get it.

1838
03:43:29,709 --> 03:43:31,559
Oh, a freakery infestation.

1839
03:43:31,559 --> 03:43:32,840
Did you know that the freakery infestation

1840
03:43:32,840 --> 03:43:35,159
are highly dangerous areas where freakers can congregate

1841
03:43:35,159 --> 03:43:36,920
to build their nest to hibernate during the day?

1842
03:43:36,920 --> 03:43:38,440
Clear all nests to be careful about that.

1843
03:43:38,440 --> 03:43:40,520
By the way, if you need anything else, just let me know.

1844
03:43:40,520 --> 03:43:42,190
I smell a nest.

1845
03:43:42,829 --> 03:43:59,370
Oh, I got a freakers way to check these houses, man.

1846
03:44:42,909 --> 03:44:45,629
Grab me and then I got his eyes out.

1847
03:44:49,950 --> 03:44:52,719
All right, supplies.

1848
03:44:52,719 --> 03:44:57,229
We're looking for ammo, snacks, bandages,

1849
03:44:58,799 --> 03:45:00,159
anything of that sort, guys.

1850
03:45:00,159 --> 03:45:01,840
If you see anything, make sure you holler at me.

1851
03:45:09,370 --> 03:45:11,370
And if you see anything in the comments below,

1852
03:45:11,370 --> 03:45:15,850
let me know if you find if you see something.

1853
03:45:15,850 --> 03:45:18,010
So yeah, guys, I was just chilling the other day

1854
03:45:18,010 --> 03:45:19,930
and I went to the ice cream store

1855
03:45:20,729 --> 03:45:23,530
and I got a chocolate ice cream and I really liked it.

1856
03:45:24,090 --> 03:45:24,889
What's your favorite ice cream?

1857
03:45:24,889 --> 03:45:26,489
Let me know in the comments while I game engagements.

1858
03:45:28,440 --> 03:45:29,639
Oh, okay, let's start the video now.

1859
03:45:29,639 --> 03:45:31,159
So hey, welcome to another video.

1860
03:45:33,899 --> 03:45:51,129
Where's the, where's my bike?

1861
03:45:51,129 --> 03:45:52,090
Oh, what?

1862
03:45:52,090 --> 03:45:53,930
I still have this stupid kidney here.

1863
03:45:58,350 --> 03:46:00,030
Your old videos were that exactly.

1864
03:46:01,069 --> 03:46:03,469
I'm not able to look back and say I've grown.

1865
03:46:10,190 --> 03:46:10,909
All right, that was weird

1866
03:46:11,549 --> 03:46:14,110
because right when the internet died, this popped up.

1867
03:46:14,110 --> 03:46:22,270
The second the internet tanked, I got like,

1868
03:46:22,270 --> 03:46:23,870
hey, make sure you just grab on your bike.

1869
03:46:27,559 --> 03:46:29,000
What the fuck was that?

1870
03:46:31,770 --> 03:46:32,889
What is happening?

1871
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:38,239
I don't know.

1872
03:46:38,239 --> 03:46:39,040
Get off of me.

1873
03:46:42,270 --> 03:46:43,309
Get your eyes out.

1874
03:46:51,229 --> 03:46:53,069
Why did I fly off the bike?

1875
03:46:53,629 --> 03:47:08,399
I got clothes lined.

1876
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:11,440
Oh, I could repair the engine.

1877
03:47:11,440 --> 03:47:12,319
This thing's fucked.

1878
03:47:27,389 --> 03:47:30,540
Get on, get on.

1879
03:47:30,540 --> 03:47:33,950
Drive the location price on your head.

1880
03:47:34,750 --> 03:47:38,590
It was a trip wire.

1881
03:47:38,590 --> 03:47:39,629
Oh, that's pretty clever.

1882
03:47:40,110 --> 03:47:50,989
It is fucked, dude.

1883
03:47:50,989 --> 03:47:51,469
Yeah, I don't know.

1884
03:47:52,510 --> 03:47:54,329
I pulled over though when I fixed it.

1885
03:47:55,129 --> 03:48:05,049
It's like a dirt bike path

1886
03:48:05,610 --> 03:48:09,129
that I'm riding with a giant Harley motorcycle.

1887
03:48:11,209 --> 03:48:12,569
Well, what the hell?

1888
03:48:13,290 --> 03:48:14,889
That's worth checking out.

1889
03:48:15,530 --> 03:48:19,079
There's just a fight here?

1890
03:48:19,079 --> 03:48:19,719
Who's fighting?

1891
03:48:20,440 --> 03:48:34,010
Will these guys be my friends?

1892
03:48:35,530 --> 03:48:42,329
I wonder if like, are these guys friendly?

1893
03:48:43,129 --> 03:48:45,879
All right, let's fight them together.

1894
03:48:53,770 --> 03:48:54,729
There you go.

1895
03:48:54,729 --> 03:48:55,209
Nice work.

1896
03:48:58,059 --> 03:48:59,340
You and me are now a team.

1897
03:49:27,530 --> 03:49:29,049
I think that was his fault.

1898
03:49:29,690 --> 03:49:31,209
He dove into my bike.

1899
03:49:32,010 --> 03:49:41,530
Three pointer.

1900
03:49:42,250 --> 03:49:43,360
Did he?

1901
03:49:43,360 --> 03:49:44,479
Wait, did he turn into?

1902
03:49:44,479 --> 03:49:44,959
I don't know.

1903
03:49:52,090 --> 03:49:53,290
Where do these people come from?

1904
03:49:53,930 --> 03:49:56,440
I wonder, there's this thing on the mini map.

1905
03:49:56,440 --> 03:49:57,000
I want to read it.

1906
03:49:57,879 --> 03:50:01,260
What does this say?

1907
03:50:01,899 --> 03:50:06,489
Three finger jack viewpoint.

1908
03:50:06,489 --> 03:50:07,450
Old hot fingers.

1909
03:50:08,170 --> 03:50:20,190
There's another person up there.

1910
03:50:21,280 --> 03:50:21,840
Who is that?

1911
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:37,360
All right, I'm getting the fuck out of this.

1912
03:50:38,079 --> 03:50:39,819
Give me my bike.

1913
03:50:41,760 --> 03:50:43,760
My guy landed on the crown of his head.

1914
03:50:45,370 --> 03:50:46,409
Oh my God.

1915
03:50:46,409 --> 03:50:47,370
Get away from me.

1916
03:50:52,319 --> 03:50:52,959
I died.

1917
03:50:57,420 --> 03:50:58,780
Now, now you die.

1918
03:50:59,420 --> 03:51:10,270
Stay down.

1919
03:51:11,739 --> 03:51:15,399
Okay, I'm going to go look up here.

1920
03:51:17,389 --> 03:51:18,670
Because this stuff up here,

1921
03:51:18,670 --> 03:51:20,190
people were up here hanging out.

1922
03:51:20,750 --> 03:51:21,870
So what was even up here?

1923
03:51:27,100 --> 03:51:27,500
Nothing?

1924
03:51:28,459 --> 03:51:29,020
Nothing at all.

1925
03:51:29,659 --> 03:51:31,280
Why was that guy standing up here?

1926
03:51:33,239 --> 03:51:34,040
All right, I'm out.

1927
03:51:34,040 --> 03:51:34,440
Let's go.

1928
03:51:35,239 --> 03:51:36,969
We're not almost there.

1929
03:51:36,969 --> 03:51:37,530
We're close.

1930
03:51:45,530 --> 03:51:46,010
Shut the hell up.

1931
03:51:47,049 --> 03:51:50,540
I was supposed to save the guy.

1932
03:51:50,540 --> 03:51:52,059
Well, I mean, he just walked off a cliff.

1933
03:51:52,700 --> 03:51:56,030
I would love to pick those up.

1934
03:51:57,879 --> 03:52:00,600
Yes, this is exclusive to PS4.

1935
03:52:00,600 --> 03:52:02,920
We cannot get this anywhere else.

1936
03:52:02,920 --> 03:52:04,760
And speaking of cannot do anything else,

1937
03:52:05,399 --> 03:52:06,680
I don't think I can go anywhere else.

1938
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:07,559
Maybe I can go this way.

1939
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:16,350
Can I go over this?

1940
03:52:17,389 --> 03:52:17,950
No.

1941
03:52:17,950 --> 03:52:21,579
It's like maybe a jump or something.

1942
03:52:24,520 --> 03:52:25,959
All right, well, I have to go this way.

1943
03:52:26,680 --> 03:52:28,170
I have to do it the right way.

1944
03:52:28,809 --> 03:52:39,549
That's what I'm talking about.

1945
03:52:39,629 --> 03:52:40,430
Deer crossing.

1946
03:52:46,399 --> 03:52:46,799
No, I don't.

1947
03:52:47,760 --> 03:52:51,120
Can you do a wheelie?

1948
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:52,559
I don't think you can.

1949
03:52:53,440 --> 03:52:54,399
Not that I've been able to do.

1950
03:53:03,899 --> 03:53:04,219
Cave.

1951
03:53:09,690 --> 03:53:10,649
Oh, it's not a cave.

1952
03:53:10,649 --> 03:53:11,450
Shit.

1953
03:53:11,450 --> 03:53:24,379
I can't go over this, I don't think.

1954
03:53:25,899 --> 03:53:27,020
I can't go over that.

1955
03:53:27,020 --> 03:53:28,940
I can't just break through that and fly off.

1956
03:53:29,899 --> 03:53:31,120
God, that would be so cool.

1957
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:31,600
Wouldn't it?

1958
03:53:31,600 --> 03:53:33,600
How cool would that be if I could just fly over that?

1959
03:53:34,319 --> 03:53:35,500
I'd be like...

1960
03:53:43,500 --> 03:53:44,139
It'd be cool.

1961
03:53:44,139 --> 03:53:44,780
It would be cool.

1962
03:53:45,500 --> 03:53:52,159
There's no way for me to jump over that.

1963
03:53:52,879 --> 03:53:59,770
I'm going the wrong way, but can I not wrap...

1964
03:53:59,770 --> 03:54:00,489
No, it's a tunnel.

1965
03:54:00,489 --> 03:54:01,049
Turn around.

1966
03:54:01,049 --> 03:54:02,090
I'm not doing another tunnel.

1967
03:54:02,969 --> 03:54:05,450
I'm not getting off the bike three times to push cars.

1968
03:54:06,010 --> 03:54:07,129
We're just gonna go this way then.

1969
03:54:07,850 --> 03:54:23,309
I feel like the bike doesn't go that fast either.

1970
03:54:24,590 --> 03:54:25,149
Perfect.

1971
03:54:25,950 --> 03:54:26,750
Just perfect.

1972
03:54:27,709 --> 03:54:31,610
You know when you play GTA with your friends in multiplayer

1973
03:54:34,170 --> 03:54:36,569
and they do this thing where they cover the whole street in cars

1974
03:54:36,569 --> 03:54:38,250
to try to block the road and fuck everybody?

1975
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:42,879
Why did somebody do this?

1976
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:58,430
Because, you know, what about blocking the zombies?

1977
03:54:58,430 --> 03:54:59,309
They can just walk around.

1978
03:55:09,040 --> 03:55:10,479
Just let the engine explode.

1979
03:55:11,579 --> 03:55:15,020
If the engine explodes, then that's the end of this game for me.

1980
03:55:15,020 --> 03:55:17,479
Because then it'll be so humiliating.

1981
03:55:17,479 --> 03:55:18,440
I'll have to stop playing.

1982
03:55:29,260 --> 03:55:35,610
That's...

1983
03:55:35,610 --> 03:55:37,129
No, that's not it.

1984
03:55:37,129 --> 03:55:37,530
That's...

1985
03:55:37,530 --> 03:55:39,290
I have the binoculars.

1986
03:55:39,290 --> 03:55:41,770
Put the binoculars away if you could.

1987
03:55:41,770 --> 03:55:43,209
That would be fantastic.

1988
03:55:50,750 --> 03:55:51,709
Okay, Terminator.

1989
03:55:52,670 --> 03:55:57,690
God damn it.

1990
03:56:04,909 --> 03:56:06,510
Bulletproof down jackets.

1991
03:56:07,309 --> 03:56:09,840
That's not embarrassing.

1992
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:10,159
That's...

1993
03:56:10,159 --> 03:56:10,799
I got ambushed.

1994
03:56:11,520 --> 03:56:26,569
Made it.

1995
03:56:26,569 --> 03:56:35,049
Give me the cutscene.

1996
03:56:36,250 --> 03:56:36,569
No.

1997
03:56:37,049 --> 03:56:39,629
I thought it was gonna go into a cutscene like it usually does.

1998
03:56:40,350 --> 03:56:42,030
Here we go.

1999
03:56:43,659 --> 03:56:44,299
Jump to fire.

2000
03:56:45,520 --> 03:56:45,840
Nice.

2001
03:56:46,639 --> 03:56:52,879
Let me in.

2002
03:56:53,440 --> 03:56:54,780
Let me in.

2003
03:56:56,000 --> 03:56:56,719
Let me in.

2004
03:56:56,719 --> 03:57:05,770
Don't fun-aloud.

2005
03:57:05,770 --> 03:57:09,579
All right, I'm gonna turn this in.

2006
03:57:09,579 --> 03:57:10,780
I'm gonna take a piss.

2007
03:57:10,780 --> 03:57:12,219
Here, we'll come back and figure out what we're gonna do.

2008
03:57:22,239 --> 03:57:34,620
If anybody touches this or anything on it...

2009
03:57:34,620 --> 03:57:35,340
We won?

2010
03:57:35,340 --> 03:57:36,620
What do you mean we won?

2011
03:57:36,620 --> 03:57:37,819
I have not made a decision yet.

2012
03:57:38,620 --> 03:57:51,000
You can't preemptively say you win while you hold the ball.

2013
03:57:52,270 --> 03:57:53,469
While it's seven to seven.

2014
03:57:54,329 --> 03:57:56,620
And you're running into the end zone.

2015
03:57:56,620 --> 03:57:58,059
You're ten yards away.

2016
03:57:58,059 --> 03:58:00,059
There's two or three people behind you about to tackle you.

2017
03:58:00,059 --> 03:58:01,979
You can't say we win.

2018
03:58:01,979 --> 03:58:03,420
Because what if you get tackled?

2019
03:58:03,420 --> 03:58:04,459
They're not gonna look good.

2020
03:58:04,459 --> 03:58:05,180
I keep telling you.

2021
03:58:06,540 --> 03:58:11,020
Everywhere you look, it's all one giant lava field.

2022
03:58:11,020 --> 03:58:12,540
25 feet solid rock.

2023
03:58:13,100 --> 03:58:16,139
It'll take jackhammers to...

2024
03:58:16,139 --> 03:58:18,219
I don't need a lecture, god damn it.

2025
03:58:18,860 --> 03:58:19,420
I get it.

2026
03:58:20,139 --> 03:58:21,020
I know you don't.

2027
03:58:21,020 --> 03:58:23,739
These people are hungry.

2028
03:58:23,739 --> 03:58:24,219
I don't...

2029
03:58:24,219 --> 03:58:27,739
Well, don't we have to at least see like the 500 zombies?

2030
03:58:27,739 --> 03:58:28,540
Remember E3?

2031
03:58:28,540 --> 03:58:29,420
I don't give a shit.

2032
03:58:30,219 --> 03:58:37,389
When are we gonna get the E3 moment when there's like 500 of them chasing us from behind?

2033
03:58:37,389 --> 03:58:38,780
Wouldn't that happen?

2034
03:58:39,500 --> 03:58:43,819
But this job's gotta get done, whether it takes all goddamn year.

2035
03:58:44,459 --> 03:58:48,479
It's not like we got somewhere else to be now, do we?

2036
03:58:49,200 --> 03:58:51,389
Wait, I'm not finished.

2037
03:58:52,030 --> 03:58:53,629
We'll make it quick, will ya, Al?

2038
03:58:53,629 --> 03:58:54,510
I got things to do.

2039
03:58:55,229 --> 03:58:59,870
Rippers, this morning one of my men spotted a large group of them coming over the pass.

2040
03:58:59,870 --> 03:59:01,309
And no one stopped them.

2041
03:59:01,309 --> 03:59:01,629
How the...

2042
03:59:02,510 --> 03:59:04,110
Tucker, you know we're already spread thin.

2043
03:59:04,670 --> 03:59:05,790
Are they headed north?

2044
03:59:06,750 --> 03:59:07,870
That's five hours in.

2045
03:59:07,870 --> 03:59:09,709
Are they headed towards us?

2046
03:59:09,709 --> 03:59:10,430
Yes or no?

2047
03:59:13,440 --> 03:59:16,920
I don't know.

2048
03:59:16,920 --> 03:59:17,959
E3 isn't real.

2049
03:59:18,520 --> 03:59:19,239
Maybe he knows.

2050
03:59:19,239 --> 03:59:19,959
Yeah, it is.

2051
03:59:19,959 --> 03:59:23,360
What the fuck are you up to now, huh?

2052
03:59:23,360 --> 03:59:24,399
What's this about, huh?

2053
03:59:25,840 --> 03:59:27,959
It's not his job to know.

2054
03:59:27,959 --> 03:59:29,639
It's your goddamn job to know.

2055
03:59:30,360 --> 03:59:32,600
I can't be in two places at one time.

2056
03:59:32,600 --> 03:59:34,600
You're the one me here running your dig.

2057
03:59:35,239 --> 03:59:38,680
You want me out there in the shit chasing the Rippers.

2058
03:59:38,680 --> 03:59:40,239
Go check the store.

2059
03:59:40,239 --> 03:59:41,840
See how much ammo we got left.

2060
03:59:41,840 --> 03:59:44,920
I'll tell Wheeler to watch the dig.

2061
03:59:45,719 --> 03:59:46,760
What are you looking at?

2062
03:59:46,760 --> 03:59:48,760
I don't know, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.

2063
03:59:48,760 --> 03:59:49,260
Don't.

2064
03:59:50,040 --> 03:59:52,540
No, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.

2065
03:59:53,790 --> 03:59:54,350
I can do that.

2066
03:59:55,229 --> 03:59:56,909
I don't know, man, I'm just waiting for you to smarten the fuck up.

2067
03:59:57,629 --> 04:00:02,590
I thought that was a person's head for a second.

2068
04:00:02,590 --> 04:00:05,069
I was like, why would you be handing me a person's head to this prison?

2069
04:00:08,190 --> 04:00:08,909
Ride with me.

2070
04:00:09,709 --> 04:00:12,969
Oh, we're going to get a double mission here.

2071
04:00:12,969 --> 04:00:14,250
All right, this is going to be good.

2072
04:00:14,250 --> 04:00:15,530
We're in a golf cart, guys.

2073
04:00:15,530 --> 04:00:16,329
Now you want me to quit?

2074
04:00:17,370 --> 04:00:18,090
You want me to quit the game?

2075
04:00:18,090 --> 04:00:18,809
We're in a golf cart.

2076
04:00:21,559 --> 04:00:22,360
Is there a potential here?

2077
04:00:27,799 --> 04:00:29,559
It's not my problem.

2078
04:00:29,559 --> 04:00:31,000
You want our food.

2079
04:00:31,000 --> 04:00:33,229
I'm making it your problem.

2080
04:00:33,229 --> 04:00:34,590
Fine, the game is good.

2081
04:00:34,590 --> 04:00:36,829
Two runs for you, but we're not joining your goddamn camp.

2082
04:00:37,709 --> 04:00:40,829
Remind me again, my old woman's memory.

2083
04:00:40,829 --> 04:00:42,110
Why is that?

2084
04:00:42,110 --> 04:00:44,860
Because it's a waste of time, Tuck.

2085
04:00:47,000 --> 04:00:48,520
Well, aren't you the optimist?

2086
04:00:48,520 --> 04:00:50,840
Rockstar added poker to Red Dead and you're playing this?

2087
04:00:53,879 --> 04:00:57,399
I had to uninstall Red Dead Redemption 2 to install this game.

2088
04:01:00,200 --> 04:01:01,879
It's not closer or further.

2089
04:01:01,879 --> 04:01:03,559
Look, I'm not Boozer's old lady.

2090
04:01:03,559 --> 04:01:04,680
He goes where he wants.

2091
04:01:08,620 --> 04:01:09,659
It's like 40 gigs.

2092
04:01:09,659 --> 04:01:10,860
Shit's burning all day and night.

2093
04:01:11,899 --> 04:01:13,020
I had to uninstall Red Dead.

2094
04:01:13,020 --> 04:01:15,739
It's piling up out here with men like you doing your jobs.

2095
04:01:15,739 --> 04:01:16,139
It's a big game.

2096
04:01:16,139 --> 04:01:18,299
It's a damn bright game.

2097
04:01:18,299 --> 04:01:20,059
Try using more gasoline.

2098
04:01:20,059 --> 04:01:22,059
It burns faster, less fumes.

2099
04:01:22,059 --> 04:01:23,020
Why is this waving?

2100
04:01:23,020 --> 04:01:24,299
Like we got so much to spare?

2101
04:01:24,299 --> 04:01:27,020
When it's all gone, what are you going to put in that bike of yours?

2102
04:01:27,020 --> 04:01:27,899
Spit and sweat?

2103
04:01:28,780 --> 04:01:30,540
Now what the hell is going on here?

2104
04:01:31,340 --> 04:01:32,219
The count's off.

2105
04:01:32,219 --> 04:01:33,899
Storage is missing food and some ammo.

2106
04:01:34,540 --> 04:01:36,860
Jesus, who was on watch last night?

2107
04:01:37,500 --> 04:01:38,940
Give me control of the golf cart.

2108
04:01:38,940 --> 04:01:40,299
Tonight, double the watch.

2109
04:01:40,379 --> 04:01:42,219
This shit's starting to piss me off.

2110
04:01:43,020 --> 04:01:43,579
You got it.

2111
04:01:44,719 --> 04:01:45,760
Trouble in paradise.

2112
04:01:46,399 --> 04:01:47,760
It's like I was saying.

2113
04:01:47,760 --> 04:01:49,040
Camp's like a prison.

2114
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:53,040
Bunch of goddamn lazy liars, thieves, rapists, and murderers.

2115
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:53,920
You know why that is?

2116
04:01:54,799 --> 04:01:55,920
No idea.

2117
04:01:55,920 --> 04:01:57,040
Cause that's who we are.

2118
04:01:57,040 --> 04:01:57,440
Oh, now it is.

2119
04:01:57,440 --> 04:01:58,639
A freak show.

2120
04:01:58,639 --> 04:02:03,360
Only folks who survive are those mean enough and nasty enough to out-freak the freaks.

2121
04:02:04,479 --> 04:02:05,920
The rest are here.

2122
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:09,280
Hope and I feed them, protect them, keep them nice and cozy and warm

2123
04:02:09,280 --> 04:02:12,159
so they can sit on their asses and watch the world end.

2124
04:02:12,159 --> 04:02:14,479
You, get your ass back to work.

2125
04:02:14,479 --> 04:02:16,079
Don't make me go get Cyrus.

2126
04:02:16,079 --> 04:02:16,879
We could've walked.

2127
04:02:18,399 --> 04:02:19,840
We could've just taken my motorcycle.

2128
04:02:19,840 --> 04:02:20,719
It's cooler.

2129
04:02:20,719 --> 04:02:22,719
Daytime is my time.

2130
04:02:22,719 --> 04:02:25,739
Running this camp is no different than running a prison.

2131
04:02:26,860 --> 04:02:28,459
I can't remember what you said.

2132
04:02:28,459 --> 04:02:29,579
You were, you were what?

2133
04:02:29,579 --> 04:02:30,940
You were a warden or something?

2134
04:02:32,750 --> 04:02:34,750
Nothing so high and mighty.

2135
04:02:34,750 --> 04:02:36,510
I was matron of the women's ward.

2136
04:02:37,229 --> 04:02:40,989
You look like the sort who might've spent some time in the pan a day.

2137
04:02:41,629 --> 04:02:48,510
Do we really have to do, I think, follow Cadgar around in Shadrath City?

2138
04:02:49,149 --> 04:02:50,909
Larson was on a run yesterday.

2139
04:02:50,909 --> 04:02:52,110
Passed through Marion Forks.

2140
04:02:52,110 --> 04:02:53,629
Every time we meet a new character.

2141
04:02:53,629 --> 04:02:56,510
Young woman with pants.

2142
04:02:56,510 --> 04:02:58,430
He stopped to look around but he never found her.

2143
04:02:59,469 --> 04:03:00,510
Is he sure?

2144
04:03:00,510 --> 04:03:02,590
Larson's been doing this as you.

2145
04:03:02,590 --> 04:03:04,110
He knows a person from a freak.

2146
04:03:06,510 --> 04:03:07,709
You can skip this?

2147
04:03:07,709 --> 04:03:08,209
How?

2148
04:03:09,709 --> 04:03:12,239
I'll see what I can do.

2149
04:03:12,239 --> 04:03:12,879
He's getting beat up.

2150
04:03:12,879 --> 04:03:16,559
Look, I want the rest of my credits for Leon.

2151
04:03:17,840 --> 04:03:21,920
You bring me warm bodies, I'll give you all the credits you can spend.

2152
04:03:21,920 --> 04:03:29,239
I gotta go find Wheeler.

2153
04:03:29,239 --> 04:03:31,159
Someone's looking at a knight in the shack.

2154
04:03:31,959 --> 04:03:33,979
Let me get in.

2155
04:03:37,879 --> 04:03:38,520
Let me on that.

2156
04:03:38,520 --> 04:03:39,000
Come on.

2157
04:03:40,459 --> 04:03:40,780
Come on.

2158
04:03:40,780 --> 04:03:41,659
Let me on my bike.

2159
04:03:42,459 --> 04:03:57,360
All right, I'm gonna go pee after we turn this in.

2160
04:03:57,360 --> 04:03:58,319
I'm gonna, we'll figure it out.

2161
04:03:58,319 --> 04:04:01,770
Alcott, what do you want, Drifter?

2162
04:04:01,770 --> 04:04:06,219
What's your problem?

2163
04:04:06,219 --> 04:04:10,459
One of my men escaped a ripper camp over by Iron Butte.

2164
04:04:10,459 --> 04:04:14,090
That tortured him, like they always do.

2165
04:04:14,649 --> 04:04:17,870
But this time, they kept asking him if he knew about it.

2166
04:04:17,870 --> 04:04:21,870
Two bikers, two men, asking if he'd ever seen them or heard of them.

2167
04:04:21,870 --> 04:04:23,149
A lot of bikes around here.

2168
04:04:23,149 --> 04:04:25,069
What's it got to do with me?

2169
04:04:27,020 --> 04:04:28,299
He's never gonna go pee.

2170
04:04:28,299 --> 04:04:29,260
The ripper called a mongrel.

2171
04:04:29,260 --> 04:04:30,940
How do you know I didn't already?

2172
04:04:30,940 --> 04:04:33,420
How many drifters still flying colors around here?

2173
04:04:33,420 --> 04:04:34,540
Is it that shit matters?

2174
04:04:35,180 --> 04:04:39,069
Can you ask me?

2175
04:04:39,069 --> 04:04:40,459
You got a price on your head.

2176
04:04:40,459 --> 04:04:41,979
Did have a coffee cup in here.

2177
04:04:41,979 --> 04:04:43,420
How's it feel to be on the other side?

2178
04:04:44,239 --> 04:04:46,399
Now why don't you just show me what you got because I don't have time.

2179
04:04:46,399 --> 04:04:48,879
Here's why you should never pee into a bottle or pee into a cup.

2180
04:04:49,840 --> 04:04:50,879
No matter what.

2181
04:04:50,879 --> 04:04:52,639
Because you'll run into a scenario like I did.

2182
04:04:55,309 --> 04:04:59,420
One time, I was in a long road trip.

2183
04:05:00,059 --> 04:05:01,950
I was in the passenger side.

2184
04:05:10,700 --> 04:05:11,200
What?

2185
04:05:16,569 --> 04:05:19,049
I'm talking about going pee into a bottle.

2186
04:05:26,459 --> 04:05:27,739
You can buy guns.

2187
04:05:27,739 --> 04:05:31,100
I see how it is.

2188
04:05:31,100 --> 04:05:37,100
Well, you guys must really be bored.

2189
04:05:37,100 --> 04:05:38,059
You don't want to hear my, like,

2190
04:05:39,340 --> 04:05:42,139
when I was sitting in the passenger seat, I peed into a bottle story?

2191
04:05:42,780 --> 04:05:44,250
Holy shit.

2192
04:05:44,729 --> 04:05:48,270
Oh my goodness.

2193
04:05:48,909 --> 04:05:55,469
You guys ever just test to see if it's possible?

2194
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:08,020
Oh.

2195
04:06:09,209 --> 04:06:09,709
Choices.

2196
04:06:10,170 --> 04:06:13,200
Bring the drugs to Tucker.

2197
04:06:13,200 --> 04:06:14,559
Bring the drugs to Copeland.

2198
04:06:15,500 --> 04:06:17,899
Manny promised to help restore your piece of shit bike.

2199
04:06:18,620 --> 04:06:19,899
Weapons for sale.

2200
04:06:19,899 --> 04:06:20,540
I want the bike.

2201
04:06:30,040 --> 04:06:31,319
So I'm on a long road trip.

2202
04:06:32,040 --> 04:06:32,840
Couple of buddies.

2203
04:06:45,399 --> 04:06:46,280
There's no story.

2204
04:06:51,600 --> 04:06:53,360
Now you see, the story is,

2205
04:06:54,879 --> 04:06:56,799
if you want, this is the truth.

2206
04:06:56,799 --> 04:06:58,000
Here's like a little tip for you guys.

2207
04:06:58,639 --> 04:07:01,920
Anytime you tell a story that is not true,

2208
04:07:02,719 --> 04:07:03,920
it's still true,

2209
04:07:03,920 --> 04:07:06,959
but you're just making up a whole bunch of scenarios in the middle of it.

2210
04:07:06,959 --> 04:07:09,120
So, the real story is,

2211
04:07:10,399 --> 04:07:11,680
in a Gatorade bottle,

2212
04:07:11,680 --> 04:07:13,440
I don't know, maybe like seven years ago,

2213
04:07:14,079 --> 04:07:17,440
I just had a full piss and pissed into the Gatorade bottle to see if it was possible.

2214
04:07:18,639 --> 04:07:20,559
And I filled the whole Gatorade bottle up with pee

2215
04:07:20,559 --> 04:07:23,280
and still had to go and had to like waddle to the bathroom

2216
04:07:23,280 --> 04:07:24,559
to pee the rest into the toilet.

2217
04:07:30,520 --> 04:07:32,200
So don't bring a bottle of Gatorade,

2218
04:07:32,200 --> 04:07:34,040
the 32-ounce bottle of Gatorade, by the way, big one.

2219
04:07:34,840 --> 04:07:54,479
Uh-oh, I think he's getting bored.

2220
04:07:54,479 --> 04:07:58,479
Because now he's like, he's telling made-up stories

2221
04:07:59,440 --> 04:08:00,959
about peeing into bottles.

2222
04:08:04,520 --> 04:08:07,790
Uh-oh, I think we've crossed the line here.

2223
04:08:08,510 --> 04:08:12,440
Hey, let me tell you,

2224
04:08:12,440 --> 04:08:13,799
one time I like peed into a bottle.

2225
04:08:13,799 --> 04:08:14,840
I was passenger's peeing.

2226
04:08:22,620 --> 04:08:24,059
I'm out of gas again.

2227
04:08:24,860 --> 04:08:26,700
I'm gonna throw piss into the gas can.

2228
04:08:38,600 --> 04:08:39,100
No.

2229
04:08:39,719 --> 04:09:06,350
If you think I'm gonna actually answer the question

2230
04:09:06,350 --> 04:09:07,790
that's being put into chat right now,

2231
04:09:09,959 --> 04:09:11,239
you don't, you must not understand

2232
04:09:11,239 --> 04:09:12,760
that this is a family-friendly streamer.

2233
04:09:24,780 --> 04:09:25,659
Pee's dirty.

2234
04:09:25,659 --> 04:09:26,540
What if I peed?

2235
04:09:48,750 --> 04:09:49,870
You see, what I was trying to do there

2236
04:09:49,870 --> 04:09:52,430
is I was trying to make them jump off.

2237
04:09:53,709 --> 04:09:54,750
I didn't think it was that far.

2238
04:09:56,940 --> 04:09:58,780
That's not, no, the stream, that's not the stream.

2239
04:09:58,780 --> 04:10:00,299
The stream's still going.

2240
04:10:00,299 --> 04:10:07,149
What does it cost me to stop playing this fo-

2241
04:10:07,149 --> 04:10:07,649
No.

2242
04:10:08,190 --> 04:10:10,639
All right, I'm gonna go pee.

2243
04:10:10,639 --> 04:10:12,959
Let me pee and then contemplate my entire life.

2244
04:10:13,760 --> 04:10:15,520
I'll be back in like two minutes.

2245
04:13:32,350 --> 04:13:33,229
Can I just say something?

2246
04:13:34,110 --> 04:13:36,809
Let me say something.

2247
04:13:37,850 --> 04:13:39,290
Can we, I got something to say.

2248
04:13:42,600 --> 04:13:43,399
The fact that there's,

2249
04:13:45,579 --> 04:13:47,260
there are 3,200 people here right now, right?

2250
04:13:48,280 --> 04:13:49,799
And even if you don't like the game

2251
04:13:49,799 --> 04:13:50,600
and think this is, you know,

2252
04:13:50,600 --> 04:13:52,120
game's not great or, you know, whatever,

2253
04:13:53,399 --> 04:13:54,040
you're still here.

2254
04:13:57,819 --> 04:13:58,540
Thank you.

2255
04:13:58,540 --> 04:14:03,280
That's like, well, let's keep playing.

2256
04:14:19,319 --> 04:14:20,809
See, I'm like,

2257
04:14:20,809 --> 04:14:22,569
I'm like pulling your heartstrings here

2258
04:14:22,569 --> 04:14:24,829
to make it so you are like,

2259
04:14:24,829 --> 04:14:26,030
oh, yeah, yeah, this is good.

2260
04:14:26,030 --> 04:14:26,989
Thanks, man, it's a good game.

2261
04:14:30,489 --> 04:14:32,010
No, here's what's gonna happen.

2262
04:14:32,010 --> 04:14:32,809
All right, here's, no,

2263
04:14:32,809 --> 04:14:33,850
but I really do mean that though.

2264
04:14:34,409 --> 04:14:38,719
You know, people could just leave,

2265
04:14:38,719 --> 04:14:40,479
but you have,

2266
04:14:40,479 --> 04:14:41,600
you're like having your fun,

2267
04:14:41,600 --> 04:14:42,479
however you have it, right?

2268
04:14:45,260 --> 04:14:48,700
We're going to, what's going on?

2269
04:14:52,250 --> 04:14:52,889
Are you having fun?

2270
04:14:52,889 --> 04:14:53,930
I actually am.

2271
04:14:53,930 --> 04:14:54,489
I mean, it's not,

2272
04:14:54,489 --> 04:14:55,610
doesn't even matter what the game is.

2273
04:14:56,250 --> 04:14:58,489
It's just fun just to

2274
04:14:59,129 --> 04:15:00,010
dick around and have fun.

2275
04:15:01,049 --> 04:15:02,329
Doesn't have to be the game any good.

2276
04:15:02,889 --> 04:15:06,120
So we've been going for about four

2277
04:15:06,120 --> 04:15:07,639
and a half hours or so,

2278
04:15:07,639 --> 04:15:09,079
just about another like 10 minutes or so.

2279
04:15:10,200 --> 04:15:10,920
We are going to,

2280
04:15:12,879 --> 04:15:13,760
hear me out, okay?

2281
04:15:13,840 --> 04:15:14,719
Are you hearing me out?

2282
04:15:16,959 --> 04:15:17,600
Back to work.

2283
04:15:17,600 --> 04:15:18,079
What's back?

2284
04:15:18,079 --> 04:15:18,879
What is back to work?

2285
04:15:19,520 --> 04:15:29,129
See if it was possible.

2286
04:15:29,129 --> 04:15:30,090
See if what was possible.

2287
04:15:30,649 --> 04:15:38,750
What is this?

2288
04:16:20,879 --> 04:16:21,760
I'm laughing.

2289
04:16:24,989 --> 04:16:25,629
Back to work.

2290
04:16:25,629 --> 04:16:26,909
We had to listen to that.

2291
04:16:28,430 --> 04:16:29,709
I forgot to mute the mic.

2292
04:16:29,709 --> 04:16:31,069
Who is fucking hurting me?

2293
04:16:32,989 --> 04:16:39,229
Show us.

2294
04:16:40,649 --> 04:16:42,170
Yeah, it's just the BRB screen.

2295
04:16:42,170 --> 04:16:42,809
It's just this.

2296
04:16:49,149 --> 04:16:50,190
All right, guys, I'll see you.

2297
04:16:50,190 --> 04:16:50,829
Be right back.

2298
04:16:51,389 --> 04:16:52,670
Okay, see you soon.

2299
04:16:52,670 --> 04:16:53,950
Don't go anywhere.

2300
04:16:53,950 --> 04:16:54,909
Okay, bye.

2301
04:16:54,909 --> 04:17:21,159
That's so stupid.

2302
04:17:23,239 --> 04:17:28,280
Okay, so hear me out.

2303
04:17:28,280 --> 04:17:29,559
My fucking stomach hurts.

2304
04:17:34,969 --> 04:17:35,770
I'm going to listen.

2305
04:17:35,770 --> 04:17:36,729
Are you going to hear me out now?

2306
04:17:38,120 --> 04:17:40,440
I'm going to play this for like another...

2307
04:17:41,239 --> 04:17:41,719
Everyone's...

2308
04:17:41,719 --> 04:17:43,000
No, please.

2309
04:17:43,000 --> 04:17:44,360
Listen, don't hear me out.

2310
04:17:44,360 --> 04:17:45,850
Hey, hey, hold on.

2311
04:17:45,850 --> 04:17:46,489
Wait.

2312
04:17:46,489 --> 04:17:48,489
I'm going to play this for a little bit longer

2313
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:51,280
and then I will end the stream

2314
04:17:51,280 --> 04:17:52,799
with a best out of three

2315
04:17:53,440 --> 04:17:55,200
Yahtzee Mario Tournament.

2316
04:18:05,239 --> 04:18:06,040
Okay.

2317
04:18:06,040 --> 04:18:08,319
Let me just do like another mission or two

2318
04:18:08,319 --> 04:18:08,639
and we'll...

2319
04:18:10,319 --> 04:18:11,680
I mean, like another 30 minutes or so.

2320
04:18:11,680 --> 04:18:13,440
We'll move on to Mario POG.

2321
04:18:14,489 --> 04:18:15,930
Mario Yacht.

2322
04:18:15,930 --> 04:18:16,969
You know what I'm saying.

2323
04:18:16,969 --> 04:18:17,690
That doesn't matter.

2324
04:18:18,250 --> 04:18:20,079
All right, where's my bike?

2325
04:18:20,719 --> 04:18:21,360
Where's my bike?

2326
04:18:26,600 --> 04:18:27,639
Back to work.

2327
04:18:27,639 --> 04:18:28,760
No, no, wait, wait.

2328
04:18:28,760 --> 04:18:29,639
I'm going back to work.

2329
04:18:31,579 --> 04:18:32,219
What's in here?

2330
04:18:34,649 --> 04:18:37,370
Yeah, this is a Mario Yahtzee waiting room

2331
04:18:37,370 --> 04:18:38,090
at this point.

2332
04:18:38,649 --> 04:18:41,719
That's so fucking stupid.

2333
04:18:44,479 --> 04:18:45,680
I'm never going to be able to repair this.

2334
04:18:46,239 --> 04:18:53,659
Check out a site called Talk to Transformer.

2335
04:18:53,659 --> 04:18:54,219
What is that?

2336
04:19:01,049 --> 04:19:01,450
I did have...

2337
04:19:01,450 --> 04:19:02,250
Yeah, I did have a bounty.

2338
04:19:02,250 --> 04:19:02,569
Hold on.

2339
04:19:03,129 --> 04:19:06,750
I got to get my bike out of there though.

2340
04:19:06,750 --> 04:19:09,930
Can I just call...

2341
04:19:09,930 --> 04:19:10,809
Okay, recover bike.

2342
04:19:11,370 --> 04:19:14,969
Recover bike to your location.

2343
04:19:15,979 --> 04:19:16,479
There it is.

2344
04:19:21,120 --> 04:19:24,889
Just everything about that is fucking hilarious to me

2345
04:19:24,889 --> 04:19:25,930
because everyone's like,

2346
04:19:25,930 --> 04:19:27,290
dude, why are you like playing this game?

2347
04:19:27,290 --> 04:19:27,850
Like, stop.

2348
04:19:27,850 --> 04:19:29,049
Like, do something else.

2349
04:19:29,049 --> 04:19:29,930
We can play Mario.

2350
04:19:29,930 --> 04:19:30,809
No, no, I'm not.

2351
04:19:30,809 --> 04:19:31,530
I need to play this.

2352
04:19:32,090 --> 04:19:32,969
I got to play this game.

2353
04:19:32,969 --> 04:19:33,930
I'm having a great time.

2354
04:19:36,079 --> 04:19:36,719
Back to work.

2355
04:19:38,700 --> 04:19:45,739
Ah, can you move out of the way?

2356
04:19:45,739 --> 04:19:49,079
That's what I said.

2357
04:19:49,719 --> 04:20:01,319
All right, what is like the mechanic?

2358
04:20:01,959 --> 04:20:06,920
All right, can't mechanics for fuel repair,

2359
04:20:06,920 --> 04:20:08,280
customize and upgrade your bike parts.

2360
04:20:08,840 --> 04:20:11,799
Is the game muted?

2361
04:20:11,799 --> 04:20:13,159
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

2362
04:20:13,959 --> 04:20:14,760
It is.

2363
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:17,399
All right, let's put $284 to repair the bike.

2364
04:20:18,200 --> 04:20:19,799
226 free fuel.

2365
04:20:21,120 --> 04:20:22,239
Get out of here.

2366
04:20:22,239 --> 04:20:23,360
Your bike could use some work.

2367
04:20:25,079 --> 04:20:25,559
Check back.

2368
04:20:27,559 --> 04:20:28,280
I have like money.

2369
04:20:28,840 --> 04:20:29,879
See you later.

2370
04:20:29,879 --> 04:20:31,079
I like, I have like,

2371
04:20:31,079 --> 04:20:31,879
I like have like money.

2372
04:20:31,879 --> 04:20:32,680
I like have like,

2373
04:20:32,680 --> 04:20:33,559
like I have like like money.

2374
04:20:34,520 --> 04:20:40,700
Hey, I haven't seen Boozer around much lately.

2375
04:20:41,840 --> 04:20:43,040
Yeah, he's around.

2376
04:20:43,040 --> 04:20:45,280
I guess he's just been doing more for Copeland lately.

2377
04:20:45,280 --> 04:20:46,159
Didn't I turn him on?

2378
04:20:48,000 --> 04:20:49,840
You tell him I said get off his ass.

2379
04:20:49,840 --> 04:20:50,319
Turn in.

2380
04:20:51,280 --> 04:20:52,319
Am I messing something here?

2381
04:20:52,319 --> 04:20:52,799
Turn in.

2382
04:20:52,799 --> 04:20:53,920
Yeah, I'll let him know.

2383
04:20:53,920 --> 04:20:54,639
Sell one.

2384
04:20:54,639 --> 04:20:55,440
Did I already do it?

2385
04:20:56,319 --> 04:20:58,139
Am I insane?

2386
04:20:58,139 --> 04:20:58,940
Maybe next time.

2387
04:20:59,500 --> 04:21:00,299
Stop by soon.

2388
04:21:01,020 --> 04:21:05,979
That's just something.

2389
04:21:05,979 --> 04:21:07,020
I've got the courage to take.

2390
04:21:07,739 --> 04:21:10,010
All right, let's go.

2391
04:21:10,649 --> 04:21:12,909
I can get a weapon.

2392
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:16,040
Sell all the bear traps.

2393
04:21:16,040 --> 04:21:27,579
I don't actually have any ammunition over here.

2394
04:21:27,579 --> 04:21:28,459
Let me see if I can get a gun.

2395
04:21:34,079 --> 04:21:34,879
Merchant, all right.

2396
04:21:35,520 --> 04:21:39,200
How you doing?

2397
04:21:39,200 --> 04:21:39,840
Hi.

2398
04:21:39,840 --> 04:21:40,879
Hey, what's up?

2399
04:21:40,879 --> 04:21:41,600
All right, weapons.

2400
04:21:42,319 --> 04:21:43,280
22 repeater.

2401
04:21:44,409 --> 04:21:45,450
I can buy the repeater.

2402
04:21:46,170 --> 04:21:47,719
I can buy a sidearm.

2403
04:21:47,719 --> 04:21:49,159
I can, I already have this.

2404
04:21:50,719 --> 04:21:52,159
22 repeater.

2405
04:21:52,159 --> 04:21:54,319
Very low stopping car requires a lot of headshots.

2406
04:21:54,319 --> 04:21:57,200
This is somewhat offset by ammo availability and quick fire rate.

2407
04:21:58,399 --> 04:21:58,899
Repeater.

2408
04:21:59,680 --> 04:22:01,079
Thousand bucks.

2409
04:22:02,120 --> 04:22:02,620
Sure.

2410
04:22:03,520 --> 04:22:04,559
That right there?

2411
04:22:04,559 --> 04:22:05,280
Good piece.

2412
04:22:05,280 --> 04:22:05,780
Thank you.

2413
04:22:07,209 --> 04:22:08,010
All right, supplies.

2414
04:22:09,309 --> 04:22:09,950
Ammo full.

2415
04:22:09,950 --> 04:22:11,069
Ammo full.

2416
04:22:11,069 --> 04:22:11,790
Pistol ammo.

2417
04:22:11,790 --> 04:22:13,069
Let's get some fillet ammo up.

2418
04:22:14,430 --> 04:22:15,069
Upgrade.

2419
04:22:15,069 --> 04:22:16,510
Sidearm suppressor.

2420
04:22:16,510 --> 04:22:17,549
Primary suppressor.

2421
04:22:18,270 --> 04:22:18,909
Miasmo.

2422
04:22:19,469 --> 04:22:20,670
Good as new.

2423
04:22:20,670 --> 04:22:22,989
And okay, what about, I can't do grenades.

2424
04:22:24,299 --> 04:22:24,799
Locker.

2425
04:22:26,379 --> 04:22:26,879
Cool.

2426
04:22:27,790 --> 04:22:29,950
All right, all right, all right.

2427
04:22:31,020 --> 04:22:32,379
All right, all right, all right.

2428
04:22:33,690 --> 04:22:37,450
Let's do one more mission and then I want to see the trail of zombies.

2429
04:22:37,450 --> 04:22:38,489
And then we can move on.

2430
04:22:38,489 --> 04:22:38,989
Okay.

2431
04:22:40,680 --> 04:22:42,440
And then tomorrow, what do you guys want to do tomorrow?

2432
04:22:43,159 --> 04:22:44,459
What do you want to do tomorrow?

2433
04:22:46,010 --> 04:22:48,809
Let's make our friend hangout plan for tomorrow.

2434
04:22:48,809 --> 04:22:49,690
What do you guys want to do tomorrow?

2435
04:22:50,569 --> 04:22:57,399
Because here, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

2436
04:22:57,399 --> 04:23:06,270
We've got Salmon Max Season 2 Episode 3 is going to be on probably Saturday or Sunday.

2437
04:23:07,950 --> 04:23:11,870
And then MS DOS Part 2 is going to be either Saturday or Sunday.

2438
04:23:12,510 --> 04:23:15,930
What is the best way to make it out of here?

2439
04:23:23,180 --> 04:23:24,379
I got to get the heck out of here.

2440
04:23:28,299 --> 04:23:29,260
Locate the drifter.

2441
04:23:30,969 --> 04:23:32,649
I guess just get me out of here.

2442
04:23:33,530 --> 04:23:34,809
This is really far away.

2443
04:23:37,469 --> 04:23:38,829
Like really far away.

2444
04:23:45,239 --> 04:23:46,040
Rage 2.

2445
04:23:51,319 --> 04:23:57,319
I feel like two AAA back-to-back games like this in a row probably aren't very good to do.

2446
04:23:58,120 --> 04:24:03,600
Can I get out of this time?

2447
04:24:03,600 --> 04:24:07,500
I don't know, we'll figure it out.

2448
04:24:08,059 --> 04:24:10,139
This is AAA.

2449
04:24:10,139 --> 04:24:11,819
This is as AAA as they come.

2450
04:24:11,819 --> 04:24:13,340
This is a Sony first party game.

2451
04:24:14,780 --> 04:24:15,280
Exclusive.

2452
04:24:21,979 --> 04:24:23,819
Why are they guys naked?

2453
04:24:24,540 --> 04:24:27,709
Why are these guys naked?

2454
04:24:28,270 --> 04:24:35,579
Were they swimming?

2455
04:24:40,879 --> 04:24:42,719
I guess they just, they're just naked.

2456
04:24:43,879 --> 04:24:47,280
All right, can I get out this way?

2457
04:24:47,280 --> 04:24:51,879
Or do I have to, I can't just go up the mountain.

2458
04:24:52,440 --> 04:24:55,930
I can't cross this.

2459
04:24:56,489 --> 04:24:58,090
The bike's going to get destroyed if I cross this.

2460
04:25:07,280 --> 04:25:08,719
No, I'm not going to ford the river.

2461
04:25:09,440 --> 04:25:11,200
That would be the last time you see this guy.

2462
04:25:12,000 --> 04:25:12,959
We need to just get out.

2463
04:25:19,229 --> 04:25:19,790
All right, out.

2464
04:25:20,670 --> 04:25:21,469
Finally.

2465
04:25:21,469 --> 04:25:23,770
Are we out?

2466
04:25:23,770 --> 04:25:25,440
We're making our way out.

2467
04:25:26,399 --> 04:25:26,799
I think.

2468
04:25:29,520 --> 04:25:30,399
No, we're not.

2469
04:25:30,799 --> 04:25:33,040
I need to get back to this road.

2470
04:25:33,040 --> 04:25:49,959
I guess we're just going to go over here.

2471
04:26:00,409 --> 04:26:01,690
Time for Mario.

2472
04:26:01,690 --> 04:26:02,809
No, it's not Mario time.

2473
04:26:04,010 --> 04:26:05,610
It's not Mario time.

2474
04:26:06,409 --> 04:26:09,129
It will be very soon.

2475
04:26:09,129 --> 04:26:10,090
I'm going to do one more.

2476
04:26:11,520 --> 04:26:13,120
Oh, why?

2477
04:26:13,120 --> 04:26:16,799
What didn't, wasn't this just taking me over here?

2478
04:26:17,840 --> 04:26:19,760
Wait, what is it doing to me now?

2479
04:26:20,479 --> 04:26:30,319
It's up ahead, wait, sorry.

2480
04:26:30,319 --> 04:26:31,920
What, what's this transformer thing?

2481
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:33,600
Talk to the transformers?

2482
04:26:33,600 --> 04:26:35,440
This is Radio Free Oregon.

2483
04:26:35,440 --> 04:26:37,120
The truth shall set you free.

2484
04:26:37,920 --> 04:26:41,120
Oh, not in the mood.

2485
04:26:41,760 --> 04:26:50,569
Start the story prompt.

2486
04:26:50,569 --> 04:26:52,809
It fills the rest of the story up automatically.

2487
04:26:57,200 --> 04:26:58,079
Shit, that's right.

2488
04:26:58,079 --> 04:26:59,920
I got to finish burning out these nests.

2489
04:26:59,920 --> 04:27:01,120
Well, I don't have to finish anything.

2490
04:27:02,159 --> 04:27:03,680
I don't have to do anything.

2491
04:27:03,680 --> 04:27:04,399
You can just go.

2492
04:27:06,760 --> 04:27:08,280
All right, mission time.

2493
04:27:08,280 --> 04:27:09,159
Then we're moving on.

2494
04:27:10,200 --> 04:27:11,399
That sounds pretty cool.

2495
04:27:12,200 --> 04:27:16,510
All right, now we're going to go here.

2496
04:27:25,629 --> 04:27:40,489
Well, I mean, the fuel is at half already.

2497
04:27:40,649 --> 04:27:42,329
It's because I was driving around the circle

2498
04:27:42,329 --> 04:27:45,290
trying to leave through the one opening

2499
04:27:45,290 --> 04:27:46,409
that I could leave through.

2500
04:27:47,290 --> 04:27:49,930
The one four foot square

2501
04:27:49,930 --> 04:27:52,250
I was allowed to go through to leave the camp.

2502
04:28:02,299 --> 04:28:05,739
Uh, you seriously just did that to me.

2503
04:28:05,739 --> 04:28:06,700
What a sniper.

2504
04:28:19,200 --> 04:28:21,120
This is seriously driving me fucking crazy.

2505
04:28:40,620 --> 04:28:41,979
Should have gone back to work.

2506
04:28:42,780 --> 04:28:44,879
Get in there.

2507
04:28:45,920 --> 04:28:46,239
Come on.

2508
04:28:52,520 --> 04:29:01,340
Days gone by legendary game designer Clyde Barker.

2509
04:29:02,729 --> 04:29:03,450
Who made this game?

2510
04:29:03,450 --> 04:29:04,649
More bounties.

2511
04:29:04,649 --> 04:29:10,440
Use this.

2512
04:29:17,680 --> 04:29:19,239
Bob Barker.

2513
04:29:19,239 --> 04:29:23,209
Dude, that's seriously the worst thing ever.

2514
04:29:26,200 --> 04:29:29,479
I'm talking like even a tap, like a little touch.

2515
04:29:29,479 --> 04:29:33,440
If you touch this fucking thing, your map will come up.

2516
04:29:33,440 --> 04:29:37,319
This is guys that made Zoo Tycoon made this.

2517
04:29:37,319 --> 04:29:40,760
That's a kind of long way away from with Zoo Tycoon.

2518
04:29:49,690 --> 04:29:50,649
I got sniped again.

2519
04:29:51,209 --> 04:29:53,690
I know you missed it because the internet sucks.

2520
04:29:55,920 --> 04:29:58,239
But somebody jumped again and did the same thing.

2521
04:30:02,250 --> 04:30:09,579
I don't know if anybody saw it, but it happened.

2522
04:30:23,799 --> 04:30:26,190
Yes, pick up the gas.

2523
04:30:38,989 --> 04:30:40,750
That FPS drop and the lights come on.

2524
04:30:44,000 --> 04:30:46,639
Yeah, unfortunately, we're stuck with the

2525
04:30:46,639 --> 04:30:52,719
internet being bad very recently here.

2526
04:30:56,239 --> 04:30:59,600
We usually hit this string of like a couple hours in a row.

2527
04:30:59,600 --> 04:31:01,920
We dropped like 20,000, 30,000 frames.

2528
04:31:04,040 --> 04:31:04,920
No more.

2529
04:31:04,920 --> 04:31:06,360
My getting more phone calls.

2530
04:31:06,360 --> 04:31:07,319
More phone calls.

2531
04:31:07,319 --> 04:31:07,719
Hello.

2532
04:31:07,719 --> 04:31:08,040
Hello.

2533
04:31:08,040 --> 04:31:08,440
Who is it?

2534
04:31:08,440 --> 04:31:09,959
Yes, it's happening again.

2535
04:31:09,959 --> 04:31:11,000
Problems are still here.

2536
04:31:15,799 --> 04:31:16,120
Thanks.

2537
04:31:28,649 --> 04:31:30,010
Oh, that's not good.

2538
04:31:43,799 --> 04:31:44,760
I can land that.

2539
04:31:44,760 --> 04:31:45,399
I know I can.

2540
04:31:49,069 --> 04:31:50,110
God damn engine.

2541
04:31:50,750 --> 04:31:51,469
I can land it.

2542
04:32:01,840 --> 04:32:04,959
I thought I could minimize damage if I land flat.

2543
04:32:05,680 --> 04:32:15,229
I guess not a terminal velocity.

2544
04:32:18,940 --> 04:32:19,899
I think I still can.

2545
04:32:49,420 --> 04:32:55,319
I just imagine like a fucking five-year-old

2546
04:32:55,319 --> 04:32:56,840
that just doesn't understand that I'm driving.

2547
04:32:56,840 --> 04:32:58,280
It just keeps flying off the cliff.

2548
04:33:00,059 --> 04:33:01,340
You should probably change to easy.

2549
04:33:01,340 --> 04:33:02,700
And you know, easy, I guess.

2550
04:33:03,500 --> 04:33:04,139
What's that?

2551
04:33:05,419 --> 04:33:07,580
I just want to drive your motorcycle.

2552
04:33:07,580 --> 04:33:15,549
I can't believe there's a you should change to easy mode.

2553
04:33:19,439 --> 04:33:20,159
Get off the car.

2554
04:33:24,139 --> 04:33:25,340
I can't make it.

2555
04:33:25,340 --> 04:33:26,380
I have to accept it.

2556
04:33:29,930 --> 04:33:30,250
Uh-oh.

2557
04:33:33,790 --> 04:33:34,590
My stomach hurts.

2558
04:33:34,590 --> 04:33:35,389
Hold on.

2559
04:33:35,389 --> 04:33:36,590
Where's my health?

2560
04:33:36,590 --> 04:33:36,990
Heal.

2561
04:33:37,549 --> 04:33:43,279
I'm gonna push you off the edge.

2562
04:33:43,279 --> 04:33:44,639
Come on, off the edge.

2563
04:33:44,639 --> 04:33:45,919
Oh, the one opportunity.

2564
04:33:45,919 --> 04:33:46,720
There it is.

2565
04:33:46,720 --> 04:33:46,959
Back.

2566
04:33:48,090 --> 04:33:48,490
Do it.

2567
04:33:50,250 --> 04:33:51,290
Go off the edge.

2568
04:33:51,290 --> 04:33:52,810
Why is there an invisible wall here?

2569
04:33:53,930 --> 04:33:54,569
Go off.

2570
04:33:55,900 --> 04:33:56,939
Oh, come on.

2571
04:33:56,939 --> 04:33:57,979
That's such bullshit.

2572
04:33:58,939 --> 04:34:00,650
That would have been so...

2573
04:34:00,650 --> 04:34:01,369
We could have stir...

2574
04:34:01,369 --> 04:34:03,369
Ah, that would have been so cool.

2575
04:34:03,369 --> 04:34:08,040
Can I get this?

2576
04:34:08,840 --> 04:34:11,080
And back up is the question.

2577
04:34:11,080 --> 04:34:16,119
Yes, I can.

2578
04:34:17,159 --> 04:34:18,119
Oh, yes, I can.

2579
04:34:23,240 --> 04:34:23,799
Bullshit.

2580
04:34:24,360 --> 04:34:28,939
I should be able to get down this.

2581
04:34:29,020 --> 04:34:33,180
I need to go that way.

2582
04:34:50,669 --> 04:34:53,229
Now it's like a fucking YouTuber joke.

2583
04:34:53,229 --> 04:34:54,029
I'm moving on.

2584
04:35:01,130 --> 04:35:02,169
I tried to back up.

2585
04:35:02,169 --> 04:35:03,529
I better thought I was gonna back it up.

2586
04:35:05,549 --> 04:35:07,709
Fucking wily coyote over here, yeah.

2587
04:35:14,939 --> 04:35:18,970
It was that simple.

2588
04:35:18,970 --> 04:35:21,930
I didn't know there was gonna be a place to go up here.

2589
04:35:22,889 --> 04:35:23,689
It was that easy.

2590
04:35:23,689 --> 04:35:24,650
It was so easy.

2591
04:35:30,560 --> 04:35:32,799
The bike is slow, but I think it's because it's not upgraded.

2592
04:35:33,599 --> 04:35:36,080
I'm pretty sure you can upgrade the bike and make it better and faster.

2593
04:35:47,099 --> 04:35:49,020
Better, stronger, faster, faster.

2594
04:35:49,979 --> 04:35:53,150
Snower, faster.

2595
04:35:54,029 --> 04:36:10,430
I'm sitting there looking at my internet.

2596
04:36:10,430 --> 04:36:13,549
I'm looking over on the right side because it went down again

2597
04:36:13,549 --> 04:36:18,330
and I took my eyes off the fucking screen to look over here.

2598
04:36:29,819 --> 04:36:30,939
I thought it was at zero.

2599
04:36:31,659 --> 04:36:32,540
It was at zero.

2600
04:36:34,360 --> 04:36:38,119
All right, we're gonna have to have another angry phone call to cox.

2601
04:36:38,119 --> 04:36:38,439
Great.

2602
04:36:39,240 --> 04:36:42,520
Every like three months I gotta call some internet company and be like,

2603
04:36:42,520 --> 04:36:47,799
hey, I'm a customer and I deserve to be treated right.

2604
04:36:48,840 --> 04:36:49,720
Oh my goodness.

2605
04:37:12,650 --> 04:37:18,000
We're almost there.

2606
04:37:19,200 --> 04:37:20,159
We'll get there this time.

2607
04:37:22,939 --> 04:37:23,419
Wait, what?

2608
04:37:24,060 --> 04:37:29,880
There's no fast travel.

2609
04:37:29,880 --> 04:37:30,919
Fast travel from map.

2610
04:37:53,319 --> 04:37:55,799
Summon Solary makes it way easier.

2611
04:37:56,840 --> 04:38:04,810
Nobody told me I could fast travel.

2612
04:38:04,810 --> 04:38:08,650
The game spent so long pausing the game to tell me I can repair my bike,

2613
04:38:08,650 --> 04:38:10,169
but it never told me I could fast travel.

2614
04:38:18,139 --> 04:38:18,540
Here we go.

2615
04:38:18,540 --> 04:38:19,099
This is it.

2616
04:38:19,099 --> 04:38:19,819
Then we can move on.

2617
04:38:42,439 --> 04:38:43,159
I found some stuff.

2618
04:38:44,840 --> 04:38:45,159
Found him.

2619
04:38:45,159 --> 04:38:45,479
He's dead.

2620
04:38:46,520 --> 04:38:50,000
Reloaded the bike.

2621
04:38:58,060 --> 04:38:59,819
Resistant coma.

2622
04:38:59,819 --> 04:39:01,979
Should be it.

2623
04:39:01,979 --> 04:39:06,250
That I hit it.

2624
04:39:08,319 --> 04:39:08,959
I really did.

2625
04:39:09,520 --> 04:39:13,200
Which way?

2626
04:39:16,090 --> 04:39:17,610
Back on track.

2627
04:39:17,610 --> 04:39:18,169
There he is.

2628
04:39:19,680 --> 04:39:20,799
Biker Bounty.

2629
04:39:20,799 --> 04:39:22,319
Some bounty targets will stand and fight.

2630
04:39:22,319 --> 04:39:23,040
Others will flee.

2631
04:39:23,040 --> 04:39:25,040
Chase your target out and capture them alive to complete the job.

2632
04:39:25,040 --> 04:39:27,279
Ramming into and shooting their bike are the best options.

2633
04:39:28,080 --> 04:39:29,439
Keep your target alive.

2634
04:39:29,439 --> 04:39:30,639
Silver helmet.

2635
04:39:30,639 --> 04:39:31,759
Red gas tank.

2636
04:39:31,759 --> 04:39:32,159
That's him.

2637
04:39:34,009 --> 04:39:34,650
Where are you going?

2638
04:39:34,650 --> 04:39:35,209
Oh shit.

2639
04:39:35,849 --> 04:39:36,409
Get away.

2640
04:39:37,049 --> 04:39:38,970
So you thought you'd ride into Copeland's camp.

2641
04:39:38,970 --> 04:39:40,009
I shoot the place up.

2642
04:39:40,009 --> 04:39:41,049
That about right.

2643
04:39:41,049 --> 04:39:42,009
Kill a few folks.

2644
04:39:42,009 --> 04:39:42,970
Take some shit.

2645
04:39:42,970 --> 04:39:43,689
Just ride out.

2646
04:39:43,689 --> 04:39:44,250
Take a shit.

2647
04:39:46,490 --> 04:39:47,689
How do I shoot from the bike?

2648
04:39:47,689 --> 04:39:47,849
I don't know.

2649
04:39:47,849 --> 04:39:48,330
But I'm going to wait.

2650
04:39:48,330 --> 04:39:49,130
Nobody taught me that.

2651
04:39:50,729 --> 04:39:51,770
I think he was waiting for me.

2652
04:39:58,750 --> 04:39:59,310
Bike combat.

2653
04:39:59,310 --> 04:40:02,669
While on the bike, tap L1 to acquire a target and tap R1 to fire your sidearm.

2654
04:40:03,709 --> 04:40:04,209
There it is.

2655
04:40:06,430 --> 04:40:14,380
The size of your target displays how accurate you are.

2656
04:40:14,380 --> 04:40:16,860
The smaller the rectangle, the better your accuracy.

2657
04:40:17,979 --> 04:40:20,680
I would say, ow, my bike.

2658
04:40:34,880 --> 04:40:40,540
Did he shoot himself?

2659
04:40:42,380 --> 04:40:43,819
Wait, who is talking now?

2660
04:40:45,419 --> 04:40:46,939
Why did he fly off like that?

2661
04:40:47,740 --> 04:40:49,580
I think he blew himself up.

2662
04:40:49,580 --> 04:41:00,490
How am I supposed to keep him alive?

2663
04:41:00,490 --> 04:41:01,770
Is he alive?

2664
04:41:01,770 --> 04:41:03,130
I don't think he's alive after that.

2665
04:41:12,060 --> 04:41:13,020
Oh, god.

2666
04:41:21,369 --> 04:41:22,569
Give drifters a bad name.

2667
04:41:22,569 --> 04:41:23,610
He has a little bit of dirt on his face.

2668
04:41:23,610 --> 04:41:24,569
What if you had shot me?

2669
04:41:24,569 --> 04:41:24,970
Like on his face.

2670
04:41:24,970 --> 04:41:26,250
He has like a smudge.

2671
04:41:26,250 --> 04:41:28,090
Stupid piece of shit.

2672
04:41:30,650 --> 04:41:32,240
Screw you.

2673
04:41:32,240 --> 04:41:32,959
Does it pick him up?

2674
04:41:32,959 --> 04:41:34,400
You want a Copeland Stonys?

2675
04:41:34,400 --> 04:41:38,400
You little bitch.

2676
04:41:38,400 --> 04:41:39,520
That's what you are.

2677
04:41:39,520 --> 04:41:40,560
You little bitch.

2678
04:41:40,560 --> 04:41:40,799
I'm...

2679
04:41:41,439 --> 04:41:42,720
Okay, mission complete.

2680
04:41:44,439 --> 04:41:44,840
All right.

2681
04:41:45,560 --> 04:41:46,040
Unlocked.

2682
04:41:46,040 --> 04:41:46,759
Gear up for the ride.

2683
04:41:47,479 --> 04:41:49,479
Copeland's encampment custom accent.

2684
04:41:49,479 --> 04:41:51,000
Cope, it's done.

2685
04:41:51,000 --> 04:41:51,479
Got him.

2686
04:41:52,860 --> 04:41:55,099
Mark down these coordinates and send your man out here.

2687
04:41:56,860 --> 04:41:57,580
Is he alive?

2688
04:41:58,459 --> 04:41:59,819
Hey, hey, drifter.

2689
04:42:01,080 --> 04:42:02,520
Yeah, he's alive.

2690
04:42:02,520 --> 04:42:05,000
But I won't promise you how long he's going to stay that way.

2691
04:42:05,000 --> 04:42:05,560
Deacon out.

2692
04:42:10,750 --> 04:42:12,189
You tell him, drifter.

2693
04:42:12,189 --> 04:42:13,389
You tell him that's such a good...

2694
04:42:19,659 --> 04:42:21,099
That's what I'm doing.

2695
04:42:22,779 --> 04:42:24,159
Oh, knocked his helmet off.

2696
04:42:25,200 --> 04:42:25,759
What?

2697
04:42:27,150 --> 04:42:30,029
I talked to Al-Kai the other day, some of the other men.

2698
04:42:30,029 --> 04:42:32,860
You've been doing runs for the camp.

2699
04:42:33,790 --> 04:42:35,229
I just wanted to say thank you.

2700
04:42:36,729 --> 04:42:37,209
That's...

2701
04:42:37,209 --> 04:42:38,330
I'm hitting him right in the face.

2702
04:42:50,759 --> 04:42:51,639
St. John.

2703
04:42:51,639 --> 04:42:52,360
This is Copeland.

2704
04:42:53,240 --> 04:42:54,919
I haven't seen Boozer in a few days.

2705
04:42:56,119 --> 04:42:57,799
He used to do runs for me, is all.

2706
04:42:58,599 --> 04:43:00,560
I know you ride with him.

2707
04:43:00,560 --> 04:43:01,840
Tried to radio him.

2708
04:43:01,840 --> 04:43:03,279
Can't seem to reach him.

2709
04:43:03,279 --> 04:43:06,830
Well, you see him, you tell him to swing by and say hello to Cope.

2710
04:43:11,369 --> 04:43:11,689
Hi.

2711
04:43:16,430 --> 04:43:17,709
Oh, no, no, no.

2712
04:43:17,709 --> 04:43:31,560
Okay.

2713
04:43:31,560 --> 04:43:38,840
Well, he tried.

2714
04:43:38,840 --> 04:44:06,509
He's just made of stone.

2715
04:44:08,799 --> 04:44:09,360
Oh, no.

2716
04:44:10,479 --> 04:44:11,119
Stone men.

2717
04:44:11,919 --> 04:44:28,840
I don't know why I got up.

2718
04:44:31,720 --> 04:44:38,200
There's no bullets in the gun.

2719
04:44:54,720 --> 04:44:55,840
Stop smoking weed.

2720
04:44:56,560 --> 04:44:59,229
What do you mean stop smoking weed?

2721
04:44:59,229 --> 04:45:00,669
It's illegal in Las Vegas.

2722
04:45:04,110 --> 04:45:06,029
It's legal in Las Vegas.

2723
04:45:06,029 --> 04:45:07,529
What are you talking about?

2724
04:45:07,529 --> 04:45:09,389
I mean, like, what are you...

2725
04:45:10,270 --> 04:45:11,400
Somebody thought I was going to do it.

2726
04:45:13,020 --> 04:45:14,540
Thing that I do all the time.

2727
04:45:15,099 --> 04:45:20,720
One of the camps can use this.

2728
04:45:21,439 --> 04:45:23,799
I don't think so.

2729
04:45:25,759 --> 04:45:27,040
Somebody knows what I was going to do.

2730
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:31,049
He smokes way too much weed.

2731
04:45:31,049 --> 04:45:33,049
That's why he's like so dumb, you know?

2732
04:45:33,849 --> 04:45:34,810
He smokes too much weed.

2733
04:45:34,810 --> 04:45:35,610
It makes him dumb.

2734
04:45:36,490 --> 04:45:43,389
Fast travel, but hold on.

2735
04:45:44,110 --> 04:45:49,880
Just needed to get some speed, that's all.

2736
04:45:50,759 --> 04:45:53,240
I just needed some speed to hit the stone men.

2737
04:45:56,009 --> 04:45:56,490
That's it.

2738
04:45:56,490 --> 04:45:58,169
Just need to go fast.

2739
04:46:00,909 --> 04:46:01,630
Fast travel?

2740
04:46:01,630 --> 04:46:02,750
Nah, we don't fast travel.

2741
04:46:02,750 --> 04:46:04,669
We fucking slow travel in these parts.

2742
04:46:10,330 --> 04:46:11,369
Just naturally dumb.

2743
04:46:12,009 --> 04:46:16,330
Hey, I'd rather be naturally dumb

2744
04:46:17,209 --> 04:46:18,490
than unnaturally dumb.

2745
04:46:20,080 --> 04:46:22,639
I don't need performance enhancing drugs to be dumb.

2746
04:46:22,639 --> 04:46:23,439
I'll check up on you.

2747
04:46:26,680 --> 04:46:27,880
Hang in there, buddy.

2748
04:46:27,880 --> 04:46:29,400
Soon as we get that arm patched up,

2749
04:46:29,400 --> 04:46:30,360
we'll ride to the north.

2750
04:46:30,360 --> 04:46:31,080
Just like you said.

2751
04:46:37,689 --> 04:46:38,090
Just work.

2752
04:46:39,450 --> 04:46:40,250
Perfect.

2753
04:46:40,250 --> 04:46:41,529
That's what falls off the back.

2754
04:46:41,529 --> 04:46:44,409
And it's a red explosive.

2755
04:46:44,409 --> 04:46:46,009
I still got some work to do on the bike

2756
04:46:46,009 --> 04:46:47,450
and we got to stock up on some gear.

2757
04:46:47,450 --> 04:46:48,490
But once you're passed up,

2758
04:46:49,290 --> 04:46:50,650
we're out of here, peeking out.

2759
04:46:51,450 --> 04:46:54,299
Okay, this is it.

2760
04:46:54,299 --> 04:47:16,639
Yeah, this camp is gonna be crawling.

2761
04:47:16,639 --> 04:47:19,439
Oh, yeah, yeah, going in nice slow, nice ammo.

2762
04:47:20,799 --> 04:47:21,439
Nice and quiet.

2763
04:47:24,639 --> 04:47:25,869
I'll give you quiet.

2764
04:47:44,110 --> 04:47:46,349
I gave up a heck in the middle of that.

2765
04:47:47,310 --> 04:47:49,150
I was gonna do really hard

2766
04:47:49,150 --> 04:47:50,509
and then I just got bored halfway through

2767
04:47:50,509 --> 04:47:51,229
and I was like, I can't.

2768
04:47:51,229 --> 04:47:52,029
I'm doing, I'm done.

2769
04:47:54,279 --> 04:47:55,240
That was thunderstruck.

2770
04:47:55,240 --> 04:47:56,119
It was the beginning.

2771
04:47:56,119 --> 04:47:57,400
It was, I was trying for it.

2772
04:47:58,680 --> 04:47:59,720
Let's make some noise.

2773
04:48:06,060 --> 04:48:06,779
Give me the first line.

2774
04:48:07,659 --> 04:48:09,680
Can somebody give me the first line to thunderstruck?

2775
04:48:10,560 --> 04:48:13,630
Okay.

2776
04:48:13,630 --> 04:48:14,970
I don't even hear it.

2777
04:48:20,599 --> 04:48:22,599
No, no, not thunder.

2778
04:48:22,599 --> 04:48:23,479
What does he say?

2779
04:48:23,479 --> 04:48:24,520
The first line.

2780
04:48:30,279 --> 04:48:31,240
Yeah, I know it's like...

2781
04:48:31,959 --> 04:48:36,779
Oh my God, what does he actually say though?

2782
04:48:37,819 --> 04:48:43,580
Oh my God, I'm still alive.

2783
04:49:10,009 --> 04:49:11,130
I gotta get on the bikes.

2784
04:49:11,130 --> 04:49:11,770
I'm gonna die.

2785
04:49:12,330 --> 04:49:12,970
Wait, rags.

2786
04:49:23,689 --> 04:49:24,650
They won't let me die.

2787
04:49:25,369 --> 04:49:27,680
Oh, finally we got a train.

2788
04:49:27,680 --> 04:49:28,639
We got our first train.

2789
04:49:29,279 --> 04:49:29,759
How many is it?

2790
04:49:29,759 --> 04:49:30,799
One, two, three, four, five.

2791
04:49:33,529 --> 04:49:34,029
Ready?

2792
04:49:34,889 --> 04:49:46,720
Get out of the way.

2793
04:49:46,720 --> 04:49:47,200
I'm trying to...

2794
04:49:51,259 --> 04:49:52,779
Why am I still alive?

2795
04:49:52,779 --> 04:49:54,139
Did it switch on easy mode?

2796
04:50:11,319 --> 04:50:14,159
I'm done.

2797
04:50:22,680 --> 04:50:23,560
Hey, just kidding.

2798
04:50:47,119 --> 04:50:47,680
Son of a...

2799
04:51:04,840 --> 04:51:05,880
What am I looking for here?

2800
04:51:05,880 --> 04:51:08,840
Uh, clearly an infestation logging camp of infestations.

2801
04:51:09,959 --> 04:51:10,680
You got it.

2802
04:51:10,680 --> 04:51:12,360
One, two, three...

2803
04:51:13,639 --> 04:51:15,869
That just didn't do anything.

2804
04:51:15,869 --> 04:51:18,990
Like I said, I ain't this old lady, Deacon Alba.

2805
04:51:18,990 --> 04:51:20,650
Can they get up here?

2806
04:51:21,369 --> 04:51:26,110
Pretty good spot.

2807
04:51:26,830 --> 04:51:32,049
Two.

2808
04:51:34,029 --> 04:51:34,590
Finally.

2809
04:51:34,590 --> 04:51:35,090
Jesus.

2810
04:51:37,200 --> 04:51:37,700
Bounty.

2811
04:51:38,560 --> 04:51:39,439
Where's Mario?

2812
04:51:39,439 --> 04:51:39,759
Fuck.

2813
04:51:39,759 --> 04:51:40,479
Hold on, just wait.

2814
04:51:41,360 --> 04:51:41,759
Just wait.

2815
04:51:41,759 --> 04:51:43,119
Just have a little bit of patience.

2816
04:51:46,750 --> 04:51:51,069
Have, you know, have five hours of patience.

2817
04:51:51,069 --> 04:51:52,430
You know, I have to have a little bit of patience.

2818
04:51:53,069 --> 04:52:09,099
Where are you at?

2819
04:52:09,659 --> 04:52:13,020
Where's the final two or three?

2820
04:52:20,169 --> 04:52:24,029
Dermot lied about Mario.

2821
04:52:24,029 --> 04:52:26,509
Dermot did not lie about Mario because Mario is going to come on the screen

2822
04:52:27,310 --> 04:52:28,270
very, very shortly.

2823
04:52:29,310 --> 04:52:30,430
In no time at all.

2824
04:52:30,430 --> 04:52:32,430
You don't even believe how quickly it's going to be on the screen.

2825
04:52:34,430 --> 04:52:40,400
I'm going to title the stream, Mario Yahtzee Rematch.

2826
04:52:49,180 --> 04:52:56,250
Zero does much clearer than nests.

2827
04:52:56,889 --> 04:52:59,790
I don't think I even have any molotovs to do that with.

2828
04:53:02,560 --> 04:53:03,060
Do I?

2829
04:53:03,759 --> 04:53:05,040
I think I threw them all being a dumbass.

2830
04:53:05,040 --> 04:53:13,209
I can only, how many can I craft?

2831
04:53:13,209 --> 04:53:13,849
Just a few?

2832
04:53:14,409 --> 04:53:14,909
Okay.

2833
04:53:38,779 --> 04:53:42,240
I need more stuff.

2834
04:53:42,240 --> 04:53:43,040
Hurry, hurry.

2835
04:53:45,400 --> 04:53:45,900
Monster.

2836
04:53:52,169 --> 04:53:53,720
I got double capped right there.

2837
04:54:07,419 --> 04:54:10,220
Be brave.

2838
04:54:10,939 --> 04:54:11,740
Pile of shit.

2839
04:54:14,409 --> 04:54:16,169
Be brave, assholes.

2840
04:54:16,169 --> 04:54:17,049
Why are you saying that?

2841
04:54:17,849 --> 04:54:25,880
There's another one probably over here.

2842
04:54:30,240 --> 04:54:32,299
Oh, there's got to be a nest in this shack.

2843
04:54:35,790 --> 04:54:38,009
Boys, just keep that out of sleep.

2844
04:54:38,009 --> 04:54:39,130
Don't pay no attention.

2845
04:54:39,130 --> 04:54:43,880
Did he say, oh, no, I missed?

2846
04:54:44,439 --> 04:54:45,240
Oh, no, I missed.

2847
04:54:47,159 --> 04:54:49,159
Come on, boys and girls.

2848
04:54:49,159 --> 04:54:49,799
Let's do this.

2849
04:54:50,680 --> 04:54:52,490
He's like way too pumped up.

2850
04:54:54,889 --> 04:55:13,259
I need more bolts.

2851
04:55:14,360 --> 04:55:14,860
Yeah.

2852
04:55:19,450 --> 04:55:20,729
Oh, fuck.

2853
04:55:20,729 --> 04:55:27,439
I'm going to die because I'm going to die.
