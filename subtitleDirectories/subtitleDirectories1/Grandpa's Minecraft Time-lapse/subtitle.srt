Hello everyone, it's Jeremy's grandfather here again. Time to do an epic time-lapse

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,059
of Minecraft proportions. Today I'm gonna be doing a time-lapse of the Taj Mahal

3
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:30,829
and it's a place that's in India and it's a big building and it's gonna be so

4
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:36,390
much fun. So I hope everyone's ready to go on a magical journey. Let's do it

5
00:00:36,390 --> 00:01:56,030
together. Here we go. That's uh, that's it. But don't even fucking look at me like that.

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,260
This game is hard, okay? This is one of the hardest games I've ever played. So what?

7
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,260
So what if it doesn't look like the Taj Mahal? You don't even know what the fuck

8
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,180
the Taj Mahal even looks like, you shithead. You're talking to somebody that

9
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,539
fought in the World War IIs. I fought in the Dinosaur-Human War of 1966 and I

10
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:19,379
fought in World War II as a fighter pilot. So if you want to fuck with me,

11
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,319
buddy, you got something coming and I will stick a knife into your face. And another thing, if you...

12
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,789
Rampart! What? Rampart, hey, Family Feud is on. Wait, what's going on? Family Feud is on. It's Monday, man.

13
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:41,319
Holy shit. It's Monday already? Yeah, let's go. That's the best show on TV. Holy shit. Fuck you.

14
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,319
Stop it, dude. Give me some food.
