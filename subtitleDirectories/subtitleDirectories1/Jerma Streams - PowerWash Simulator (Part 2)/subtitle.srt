00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,929
Hello. Hold on. Sorry. Welcome to the stream, everybody. How you doing? What's going on?

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,649
That was a really unenthusiastic hello. Hello. Let me just grab my tea. I got a green tea. Let me get

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:01:13,829
it. I'll be right back. That EU stream today. That's right. We're back. Okay. So today,

4
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:25,129
as you're probably recognizing, we've got a sponsor segment today. It's gonna be a good one.

5
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:37,159
This is Power Wash Simulator. If you remember, I played this game about a year ago. And what do you

6
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:46,599
know? This shit's in 1.0. It's out. I think actually literally today. Like right now.

7
00:01:47,239 --> 00:03:33,349
Hold on. I got the wrong straw. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. Let's go.

8
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:45,740
Let's go. Yeah, the stream is sponsored today by of course, Power Wash Sim. It's out on everything.

9
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:55,379
Xbox, Xbox One, PC, Steam, everything. Go take a look. And so since a year ago,

10
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,530
I think they've added a lot of shit to the game. So we'll see what they have.

11
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:22,920
Is this on Xbox? Dude, I'm so happy you asked. It's on Xbox, Xbox One, PC, Steam, Xbox Series S.

12
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:32,500
Why did that take me so long to say that? No, I actually really like this game. This game was

13
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,379
really fun last time I played it. So I'll have a year of development, by the way.

14
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:46,250
Was this game in early access? Because was this only? That's a pretty awesome story there.

15
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,860
The game was in early access for like a year, year and a half, whatever. And now it's out.

16
00:04:54,329 --> 00:05:09,449
That's it. Easy. Early access for like a year. Out. Released. All right. Let's go. This multiplayer?

17
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:19,339
What the? What? What? All right. Hi. Hello. All right. So what was it? What was in the game

18
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:28,250
last time? Was it just this career mode before? You're the same shirt as yesterday. No, what?

19
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,000
The shirt I had on yesterday was black. This is a gray shirt. How would this? This is not the shirt

20
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:50,519
I had on yesterday. This is gray. You're unclean. Well, yeah, maybe I could use a power washing.

21
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:56,699
It's the same background. I'm sorry. I don't have a funny Zoom conference call joke where there's a

22
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:10,329
roller coaster behind me. Dude, it has cross play with Xbox players too? Holy shit. Can I swear on

23
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:20,680
this? I think so. Okay. I hope so. All right. So what did I do last time? All right. I wait,

24
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:28,470
did I not finish this? Oh, it's so it kept the other stuff that I did. All right, cool.

25
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:40,279
What's specials? Clean the Mars Rover, gnome fountain, steam locomotive, golf course. Should

26
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:51,449
I do the golf course? Free play? All right. So should I finish what I started here?

27
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:02,339
I took a power washing job a year ago and I did half the house. I just left. And then

28
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:11,019
I called the same family a year later and I go, hey, come back and finish that job

29
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:22,629
that I did halfway. The same price, of course. All right, let's go. Yeah, this is,

30
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:31,259
I like it. I'm gonna turn the volume up. It's a little low. I don't know if it's too loud.

31
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:51,420
How did I turn it way down? Why did I turn the volume so low? Why is everything so low?

32
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,620
There we go. Okay, well, that that's why I did that.

33
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:12,790
That was a little too loud. That was a little too loud for my for my liking. Okay, there we go.

34
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,420
All right. So what's wrong with it? What's wrong with this? You were doing a bit the last time

35
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:27,500
you played. What was the bit I was doing? Oh my god, I hope nobody was at the front door.

36
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:41,639
This is like a laser. Okay, I didn't do anything. What was the routine I was doing last time?

37
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:48,490
It was oh yeah, it was all dogs talk like Scooby-Doo. That was a fucking year ago.

38
00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:09,100
I felt like that was last weekend. How was that was that long ago? Oh, I love it. Oh, all right.

39
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:25,580
So I missed this whole side of the house. Taking care of your gutters for free.

40
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:45,590
And that's when I leave a card. I leave a card on the fucking front step. Oh, isn't there a button

41
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:54,679
you can do to see how much is left? How much of cleaning you have to do left? Tab. Yeah, there's

42
00:09:54,679 --> 00:10:01,909
like there's like a hitman like see through walls thing, right? How did I get how do I get on the

43
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:09,720
roof? They're looking out the window right now. Honey, I don't know where you found this guy,

44
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:31,370
but he keeps spraying the same two sections of the house. And he charges $1,000 an hour. Oh,

45
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:40,379
you can rotate the nozzle to y'all. Yeah, you can. I remember this fast. Is this the new

46
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,740
phasmophobia update? No, this is power wash simulator. It's available right now. It just

47
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:52,620
came into 1.0 games. Great games fun. We played it. It's been a while. You can get it right now.

48
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:03,620
I highly suggest you do the game is fucking phenomenal. No music. What the hell is this?

49
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:26,870
Why did they why did they they added a VR mode? All right. What is this? No music. How did I turn

50
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:48,250
it off? Did I remove it from like the I&I files? I don't know. I don't think so. But somebody asked

51
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,250
but hey, is it out for Xbox? I'm really glad you asked that question. Of course it is.

52
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,450
Xbox Series S. Actually, is it on? I don't want to say something that's not true.

53
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:09,259
It's on. All right. Xbox has that service, right? Where you can it's a service that you can you can

54
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:17,190
pay for and it's something could be on that service. Is it on that service? Is it in there?

55
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:27,210
It's on that service. All right. All right. Somebody said, what did I do?

56
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:38,470
I mean, I mean, honest to God, I got to tell you, it's just good clean fun.

57
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,870
Like really, it really is though. I'm like, I'm serious.

58
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,620
What if this don't do the roof? How the fuck are they going to know? You know what I mean?

59
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:06,580
They're going to come out here. They're going to go. Oh, wow. Oh, you did such a good job.

60
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,539
Look at that garage door. Look at that window. It hasn't been clean like that in 20 years.

61
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:19,029
They're not going to go on the roof and look at their ceiling. Why would they do that?

62
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,669
And if Dad wants to be like, oh, can I check the roof? I'd be like, that's done. That's unsafe.

63
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,730
Let a professional go up there. And then I'll go up there and I'll look around and be like,

64
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,809
this is clean as hell. Holy shit. This is clean. And then that dad's going to be in like slippers

65
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:38,779
and he's going to have a newspaper and he's going to go, oh, yeah, but you'll lick the top of the

66
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:58,409
roof. And I'm going to be like, of course I will hurry up. You don't hurry up a job like this.

67
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:04,700
This is I'm power washing. You don't hurry up.

68
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:28,039
By the way, how did I go from 50% to 40%? I don't get it. You're making it worse.

69
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:37,480
There's not dirty water in here. It's clean water. You're going to spend an hour washing

70
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,759
the front steps. No, I'm not going to do that. Do I have a streamer mode on because of the music?

71
00:14:46,389 --> 00:15:04,340
I don't think I do. Streamer mode, autosave, aim mode, stance, dirt details, FOV, obviously,

72
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:10,500
right? I don't think so. I think it's my game. I think I just, I don't know, try the YouTuber

73
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,259
mode. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I like, maybe I think I screwed something

74
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:28,740
up. Wait, how about reset audio defaults? Should I try that? I don't, is there even music in the game

75
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:39,350
here? I need the, okay, I need this, the, the bigger nozzle. Give me the wide one. No,

76
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:50,419
always the wide one. There it is. All right. Every time I ever see anybody power wash,

77
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:55,379
they always do it so wrong. They always do this thing where they like, oh, did I do it?

78
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,230
No, what you have to do is you have to act like a, like a copy machine. You have to do,

79
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:16,549
it's kind of like robotic movements. Then you touch up. I love that sound. The sound effect

80
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:28,139
is actually really good. All right, now back it up. Do you remember thinks he knows everything?

81
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:39,830
No, but I, I've, I've power washed before. I've, I've done it before. Not professionally,

82
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:46,570
but I've, I've done it before. All right, no one messing around. Let's actually,

83
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:59,129
let's actually get this done. Okay, sure. I, I've power washed before. Yeah. And some of you clowns

84
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:14,279
that power wash, you do this. Trust me. I know the technique, the look it's clean. And then,

85
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:32,119
you know, dad comes out and goes, no, it isn't. And you're like, fuck. And then dad's going to

86
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:41,700
take it anyways at the end. I had him just do it all again. No, no, no, stop, stop. Let me see that

87
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:55,960
for a second. Let me, let me see that. All right. That's good. It's like, dad, you just,

88
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,460
you just did the whole thing again. And then, and then you go, no, no, no, dad, let, give,

89
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:09,900
give me that thing. Because it's fun to do. And you end up power washing the same thing,

90
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:22,650
like four times. All right. I think the front steps are fine. Did I miss anything? Oh,

91
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:40,950
hold on. I did. Watching your stream makes me sneeze. I, I think I would calculate the dust

92
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:51,990
in your room. Are you sure it's not when you're sitting at your computer? There's no time limit

93
00:18:51,990 --> 00:19:06,730
on this. It's fine. Is this pre-recorded? Why, why, why would this be? No, it's pre-recorded.

94
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:17,690
Pre-recorded. Oh, that it's done. That's the only thing I've done though. How long have I

95
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:26,759
been playing? I've been playing for 20 minutes and I finally got my first ding. What? How long

96
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:54,710
have I been sitting here for? I just got my first ding in 20 minutes. That's impossible. This is,

97
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:05,450
oh, what? I mean, where's my ladder? That's the best part, by the way. That's the best part

98
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:18,970
right here. And then, and then when you see all the dirt just fly everywhere and it turns into

99
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:32,099
this like brown sewer water looking stuff. Oh my God. I love it. Okay. So 43 recycled joke.

100
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:40,519
How's that? That's not a recycled joke. What are you talking about? Recycled joke. You don't

101
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:51,690
remember what I said a year ago. Okay. You don't remember what I said a year ago. And by the way,

102
00:20:51,690 --> 00:21:04,740
how is that a joke? That's me saying I like something. You know, like I'm not ordering food

103
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,299
at a restaurant with you. And it's like, Oh, what do you want, man? What do you want to eat?

104
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,460
Dude, I think I'm doing the like, I don't think I'm just gonna go with like the turkey club.

105
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:18,099
What are you really gonna order though? I'm ordering a turkey. I like turkey sandwiches.

106
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:26,259
It's cool. Dude, stop stop this fucking bit and order a tuna sandwich. What are you? What are

107
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:57,640
you talking about? Second ding in the night. There it is. There we go. All right. Is that

108
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:06,200
it's kind of loud. Let me turn that down. Just a just a tiny bit. Just a little. Let me turn this

109
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:24,660
up. Turn this down. Just a little. That sounds nice. Is that better? A little more. Now we can

110
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:36,490
hear the birds and shit. That's better. That's better. That's better. Okay. That's good.

111
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:54,519
There's up to six people in co-op, by the way. That seems kind of chaotic. I need the ladder

112
00:22:54,519 --> 00:23:01,990
now because there's no way I'm going to do that. I'm not gonna be like it up there. Should I change

113
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:12,599
this? Oh, no. I had this upgraded once already. All right. So where's this still dirt? Oh,

114
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:39,269
this is the best part. Here we go. Check this out in one sweep. It feels good.

115
00:23:53,190 --> 00:24:07,769
I was holding my breath for that one. Oh my god. The what the the whole top of the house

116
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:17,619
needs to be done. There we go. You're gonna start seeing dings every five seconds now.

117
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:34,180
Steps? Where? Concentrated blast. I'm pissing somebody off so bad right now. You know what

118
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:41,210
I mean? There's at least a few of you in the chat right now that have had a clenched fist

119
00:24:41,210 --> 00:25:02,039
since I turned it on the stream. Doesn't it feel like it's something is adding more dirt to it?

120
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,359
That's every time you power wash. This happens. I feel like I did this five times already,

121
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:25,880
but I didn't. There we go. Where's my ding? Where's my ding? Oh my god. It's underneath.

122
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:36,789
The splash was like reflecting off of this guy's car and I thought the police were here.

123
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:55,450
I was like, wait, what? I how I can't get underneath. How am I supposed to get

124
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:23,059
underneath here? I need this one yet on spins. There we go. Let's see a ding

125
00:26:28,220 --> 00:27:03,019
like this. I'm doing this so wrong. Stand up. Just get up. What? All right. That's good enough.

126
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:10,339
That's actually good enough. It is. No human can come out here and tell you're gonna come out here

127
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:22,150
and swab it and send it to a lab and test it for dirt. There's nothing else here. I'm sorry. If I

128
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,960
see out the window, this guy lying on his back aiming up at the same place, I'm gonna go out.

129
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,640
I'm gonna open the door and be like, that's good. That's good. You don't have to do it. That's all

130
00:27:31,640 --> 00:28:01,049
right, man. Don't worry. Stop peeling the paint. It's the whole railing. Oh my goodness. Look at

131
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:30,440
all this. Got it. What? No way. That shit was here. That's part of the foundation of the house at

132
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:43,299
this point. All right. It's not, I can't clean it. All right. You look like emperor Palpatine.

133
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,309
I was going to give you a no. I was going to just do the laser hands into the screen.

134
00:28:48,869 --> 00:29:20,859
I'm like, nah, I was going to laser hands you. Oh my God. What's this thing? Change stance.

135
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:27,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Change stance. What does that mean? Oh, wait, there,

136
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:35,930
there are three stances. Okay. I, one of them is crouched. The other one is lie down. I'm

137
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:41,289
proning, crawling right now, crawling around. You imagine looking out the window,

138
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:49,160
you see like a guy like, let's go. Just proning and like, got him.

139
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:08,740
A guy proning in your front lawn, just like aiming up with the power washer. All right.

140
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:18,519
I'd stop coming over here. I keep doing the front door. This is going into their house.

141
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,539
I'm sorry. If you have this meticulous about this, this water going into the house,

142
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,920
nobody has weather stripping. That's that good. This is going like, this is going in the house

143
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:47,740
into their living room. The guys get over the front door. It's water all over them. Like it

144
00:30:47,740 --> 00:31:02,900
took a shower. He's going to be like, is that supposed to happen? Standing there for 20 minutes,

145
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:10,660
blasting the door. I wouldn't, I feel like this would break a window, right? I wouldn't want to

146
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:42,200
do that. I can't still be there here. You physically can't get up there. Nobody can.

147
00:31:42,200 --> 00:32:06,970
I have to, I have to ricochet it. I can't do it. Got it. All right. That's done. Good. What the

148
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:19,690
what? How I've done, honest to God, I've done this 10 times. How can this still be edges of the fence

149
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:45,670
that I haven't gotten? I don't understand. I feel like it's respawning. This is like resident evil

150
00:32:45,670 --> 00:33:05,819
mold on this person's house. I've done this like five times. Well, duh, it's your enemy. It's an

151
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:24,710
FPS, but again, yeah, the stream is sponsored by power wash simulator. This game's actually really

152
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:36,740
fucking fun and you can get it on Xbox, Xbox S steam, everything, all this stuff. It's got co-op.

153
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:56,700
It's in 1.0. This is a different person's house. What the hell happened? Wait, what? Um, excuse

154
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:14,949
me. Okay. Well, where do I even start? Okay. I get up. Don't start this yet. Yeah. I know that's

155
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:30,809
dirty. I know there's dirt on this side. This is a Harvey dent house. No, this is, this is like two,

156
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:35,699
two roommates or it's like, it's a duplex. There's two tenants here. One of them is, you know, evil

157
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:45,019
and the other one's like an angel and they share a flat together. All right. Where's this? Where's

158
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:55,989
the, uh, how do I get to the, I'm going to go up on the roof. Although it actually is prone. It's

159
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:08,650
been blocked by my drink this whole time. How do I visit ladder? Oh, hi. All right. Let's, let's take

160
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:25,340
care of this because this is ridiculous. I feel like I should do this from the ground. All right.

161
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:31,690
Here's the one incredibly important factor in this whole thing. Don't leave until it's done.

162
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:38,699
You know what I mean? Don't leave until it's all gone. What I keep doing is I keep spraying and

163
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:45,820
talking and spraying and I just walk away. Don't leave this spot until it's, this is all gone

164
00:35:45,820 --> 00:36:00,489
because I keep just walking away after spraying it. Okay. So far so good. All right. So that's,

165
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:08,940
this is done on this side. What about up here? Okay. So now I just got to deal with this.

166
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:28,260
You've sponsored the power wash and you can't do it. I think I'm doing just fine. I think I'm

167
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:35,099
doing just fine. You're at 6% an hour. Do you have any idea how long it would take to power wash

168
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,159
this house in real life? The condition of the outside of this house, it would take two months.

169
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:49,349
I would have to come back and do reverse coats of paint. You know what I mean? I'd have to,

170
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:53,429
I would have to come back on three separate occasions in like four or five separate weeks.

171
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:32,070
This would take three months to do. Here we go. Think someone could speed run this game.

172
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,030
That would be awesome. I'm sure people have already tried to do it.

173
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,480
I wonder. People already do. Yeah. I wonder. I wonder just this house in particular. I wonder

174
00:37:47,480 --> 00:38:02,119
how long it took to do a 100%. You better believe that's going to be hard to do. I think we're

175
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:18,340
almost good. I have to have a ding coming soon. It has to be, right? Really? Get out of the,

176
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:30,309
what the hell? There it is. All right. So there's that ding. I like the beard. You should grow it

177
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:37,320
out. I can't. I literally can't. This is like one of those ads for mobile games where the person in

178
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,400
the ad is like insanely incompetent. And so you want to download the game just to show that you

179
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:54,059
can actually do it unlike the dumb ass in the ad, but that's so unfair. Well, then go get it.

180
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,590
Then go get it. It's on, it's on Xbox. It's on steam right now. It's on fucking game pass. Go get

181
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:07,750
it. Why don't you do it? That's so unfair though. You know why that's unfair? Because in those mobile

182
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,909
game ads and trust me, I've seen millions of them. I've seen millions of those ads. I play,

183
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:18,519
all I do is play iPad games. You understand that they, it's usually like, oh no, there's a fire.

184
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:24,119
What do we do to put the fire out? And there's two options pop up on screen here and here. And one of

185
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,780
them is a fire extinguisher and the other one is like a golf club. And it's, they try to drag the

186
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:38,630
golf club up on the fire. I'm not doing that here. I'm, I'm not doing that. I'm, I'm, I'm power washing

187
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:48,340
doing it the correct way. If I had a golf club in my hands and I was hitting the side of this house,

188
00:39:48,340 --> 00:40:20,219
then I would understand your point. But I, come on. The golf club is your brain. All right. Did I,

189
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:33,340
I didn't finish this part. I'm getting tutorials. Oh, it's because I'd never pressed them. Okay.

190
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:42,150
So this is done, right? All right. This one's done. Keep going. Now with the, I'm moving on.

191
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,789
This whole side of the house has to get done, but I'm not doing that right now. 40 only,

192
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:53,590
of course it's 47%. I have the Satan demon person that lives over on this side. I have to do their

193
00:40:53,590 --> 00:41:55,420
house. I want to try to get it up over the fence. I don't, I physically don't think you can. It

194
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:00,889
legally touched my truck. Therefore it's mine. It touched my truck. Therefore it's legally mine.

195
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:21,860
Where'd it go? I never put my hands on it. What was I doing? Oh yeah. I gotta go for it.

196
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:39,460
You're doing the mobile ad. No, even if I were to sit here and do this. Okay. Nozzle four. Oh,

197
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,610
what it worked. I would still be doing more than the mobile ads always do. You understand? Like

198
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:50,409
I'm actually still doing it. I'm still actually pressing the button and washing the side of the

199
00:42:50,409 --> 00:43:01,110
house that like, even if I was doing it like that, you know, what's actually really funny about,

200
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,360
about mobile ads now, I think we've talked about this a little bit, but there's a, there's a game

201
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,480
that I see ads for all the time now. And it's like, aren't you getting sick and tired of those

202
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,860
ads that show the slide, the puzzle game, and it's never in the game. We have that in our

203
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:25,030
fucking game. We actually have that. All these like posers, it's so funny. And you know what?

204
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:33,590
They must be pissed. They must be pissed off because they actually have this slide, the puzzle,

205
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,809
watch out for the fire and get the gold game. Right. And everybody else just is doing that in

206
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:44,659
their ads. And they just have to sit there and go, well, that's our game. We actually have that in

207
00:43:44,659 --> 00:43:52,309
the video game. It's like, do you want to play that game? We have it. If we actually have that

208
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:59,369
in our game, they don't, it's been debunked. No, I know. But my point is that there are companies

209
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:07,099
right now. I'm getting ads right now of somebody literally saying, Hey, those ads are bullshit.

210
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:14,780
Aren't they? I know we have that game. It's not fair. I swear. I promise you. But they don't have

211
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:30,860
it either. What? It's not in that game either. Hold on a minute. But how you can't how you I

212
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,579
don't know about that. I feel like that's inaccurate. You can't make an ad stating,

213
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:41,510
Hey guys, aren't you sick and tired of those ads that show that game and it's not in the game?

214
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:58,280
Download ours. Ours is in there. It's not in there. What? No, no way. That's impossible.

215
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:07,500
It's true. What? Okay, but hold on. It might not be the core of that game. Right? It might not be

216
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:20,519
the core gameplay of that game. But is it in the game? And can you actually do it? No. What? No,

217
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:33,190
it's not. It's impossible. Hey, fuck all those other games, man. We got that in our game and

218
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:45,210
it's not in the game. No, I cannot speak to that. I don't know how true that is. Dude, why doesn't

219
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:52,389
somebody just make one of those? Just make a slide the puzzle game. And then you can be the savior,

220
00:45:52,389 --> 00:46:07,659
the hero of the mobile game ad world. You know what I mean? Just make one. Because I'll tell you,

221
00:46:07,659 --> 00:46:11,659
if I downloaded a game and I saw that it had the sliders in it, and that kind of and that it was

222
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:18,550
just 100 levels of like 500 levels of that game. I'd be like, you know what? Nice job. Nice work,

223
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:34,619
actually. Actually good work. All right, now somebody has to edit edit me in to just like

224
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:40,039
interior of just like a living room. And you know, just like, you know, family just kind of like

225
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:45,239
whatever sitting around like a stock image or something, and have muffled audio of that what I

226
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:52,940
was just doing. And have loud kind of footsteps on the top of the roof. I think that would be

227
00:46:52,940 --> 00:47:33,880
pretty funny. Hi, what is left? I'm gonna get more concentrated here. God, I'm just thinking about

228
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:53,380
this right now. There's an engineer move in TF2. Slow me down. Okay, let me rephrase that and

229
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:01,659
say what I wanted to say. A TF2 weapon as a power washer would actually be pretty fun.

230
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:48,840
Like a jet of water jet. Come on, give me the ding. The ding is so close. The ding is so close,

231
00:48:48,840 --> 00:49:08,230
dude. Come on. Where's the ding on the side of the house? This one little piece? Where is it?

232
00:49:09,349 --> 00:50:09,179
Right here. Come on. Ding. How come I'm not getting a ding? Is this why down here? You've got to wash

233
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:24,489
your sin. I think that would take a while. Only red is the wall. Wait, what do you mean? What do

234
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:57,289
you mean? What are we talking about? Hold on. I'm typing. Hold on. I'm typing. You need to relax.

235
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:03,110
Okay, so it's just the entire wall. How do I get from here to there?

236
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:29,989
God, that was fun. There's a much better way I can do that.

237
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:40,019
There's a much better way I can do that. So should I? Okay, for all you power washers out there,

238
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:48,730
it's big nozzle straight down into sections, right? So I start here and walk backwards.

239
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:58,949
This is poop from an airplane. Oh my god, dude. Yeah, there's so many bird shits on this house.

240
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:07,590
Honestly, you know what's crazy though? I wonder how much bird shit is on your roof.

241
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:22,039
It's probably awful. It's probably crazy. I can't imagine what everybody's just straight down

242
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:32,010
bird's eye view of roof looks like. Because unless you do something like this, it's probably covered

243
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:57,420
in bird shit. It rains. Not everywhere. It does not rain a lot in every location. Not here. Not in

244
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:23,239
Vegas. I wonder how many bird shits I have on my roof. Are you keeping track? How would you keep

245
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:32,360
track of bird shits? What are you gonna go up there every few days? Go for the clipboard? Just

246
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:45,269
see your neighbor just like he's making marks and you don't clean it. All right, so that top is

247
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:57,659
all right. Now I'm gonna go this way first. Don't forget about the chimney. You know, I have to give

248
00:53:57,659 --> 00:54:04,170
the devs credit because that it's not just like, oh, yeah, just spray it a little and just go side

249
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:09,059
to side and you did it. You actually have to do this. You have to actually truly power wash this

250
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:21,769
house. I have to actually get in here and do all this. It seems like there's a lot more content

251
00:54:21,769 --> 00:54:26,710
since when we last played a year ago. Does the game look better? I feel like the graphics are

252
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:59,659
better. Am I out of my mind? It's the same house. It's a year later. Don't fall. You're just spraying

253
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:18,889
into the chimney. Yeah, I gotta clean the chimney too. Oh my god, I can jump high. I'm looking at

254
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:37,940
the ding. I can't get in there. I can't get in there. It's unsafe for me to get in here.

255
00:55:37,940 --> 00:56:28,230
I need that with the wiggle one. It's unsafe. I can't get it to ding either. Maybe I just spray

256
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:39,340
it up there. It's right. It's this tiny little piece on the left. Just get on the other side.

257
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:51,400
Can I can I put the ladder up there? You missed the whole right side. Oh, it's all good. We're good.

258
00:56:51,400 --> 00:57:05,590
There should be a grenade. Why are you seriously making me contemplate if that would work?

259
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:16,500
If you had a device that was a water grenade, but what would you use it for? It was a pressurized

260
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:24,469
water system in the thing and it would just like shot out. That wouldn't it would work. No, it

261
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:36,059
wouldn't. It would clean soap and water in the grenade. Well, hire the cleaning service. Yeah,

262
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:41,820
you think I just shows up. He's got like fucking grenades on him. He's just like, yeah, I'm ready.

263
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:47,659
Everybody if we could get up out of the house, that'd be great. Everybody leaves. Okay, so what's

264
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:58,420
the dirtiest room in the house? Bedroom? Okay. It's just soap and just the bedroom's destroyed.

265
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:38,179
Phil's water grenades. That'd be $800. You walk out. Phil's like in his car. He's doing like some

266
00:58:38,179 --> 00:58:42,949
paperwork and it's like, oh, thanks for coming, Phil. And he's like, yeah, yeah, it's all good.

267
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:47,349
Hold on a second. I'm going to clean my car. You look and you like, yeah, your car's looking a

268
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:53,190
little dirty, Phil. Don't worry about it. I got it. He just steps out. He just throws the

269
00:58:53,190 --> 00:59:03,559
grenade in the car and it's just cartoon. Just the car just goes like, boop. There's just some

270
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:12,940
papers fucking everywhere. This is like, there's all kinds of like destruction. He goes to turn

271
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:22,010
the car on. Hey, look, buddy. I think I could borrow your car for a few hours. I've got a

272
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:41,130
few more. I got a few more of these jobs. I've been cleaning the safe spot for 15 minutes.

273
00:59:41,769 --> 01:00:12,099
Yeah, man. I know. Let us bet on what? What do you need to bet on? Water, C4.

274
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:31,369
You just set them up around the whole house. What are you talking about? All right, slow down,

275
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:50,860
slow down. This is not powerful enough. You see, we got, I got to go harder. That's Splatoon.

276
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:57,619
Yeah, but nobody's going. I can't do this on camera. It's like weird.

277
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:06,090
You know, the exact thing I was going to do. Everybody knows the exact sound effects. I was

278
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:13,289
just going to do all of you. You saw my neck go like this, tilted. You knew exactly what was

279
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:34,420
going to happen. I feel like that's too predictable. We don't care. We want it. All right, mods, run a

280
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:40,099
poll, please. If it gets to at least 80% with at least 5,000 votes, I'll do the noise. I'll do the

281
01:01:40,099 --> 01:01:55,289
thing that everyone wants me to do. Remember everybody, you saw my neck tilt. You know what

282
01:01:55,289 --> 01:02:04,039
could have happened? So will you play Splatoon with it? I don't, I couldn't play Splatoon. I

283
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:10,019
don't know why something about it. Just, I just, I kind of just didn't, I didn't get it. I know,

284
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:15,460
I completely understand, but the counter, you know, I, it kind of just triggered old memories

285
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:21,219
of playing Tony Hawk with friends. And it was that mode where if you did a trick on something,

286
01:02:21,219 --> 01:02:27,059
it would change to their color. I remember just doing really well and just like boom, orange,

287
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,579
but boom, orange, but boom, orange, orange. And I had the whole, and then I would turn around for

288
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:37,780
five seconds. And my, my dickhead friend has got like a 2 million point combo going. And he runs

289
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,739
over every single thing I did. And I just turn around, it's all blue and it's like, why am I

290
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:56,860
playing the game? So I, that's why I don't like, that's just Splatoon for me. All right, let's see,

291
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:06,230
at least over, it has to be over 80% and it has to be at least 5,000 votes. And I'll do, I'll do it.

292
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:14,730
Somebody just said, dude, it takes two clicks to vote. Come on guys. And there's some of you just

293
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:27,190
sitting there leaning back, just like, nope, I ain't doing that. I don't care. It's so funny

294
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:31,909
doing the votes and polls and just the amount of people that just genuinely just don't care

295
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:37,030
about any of this. It's just like, I don't care what he does. Just, I, I just like kind of hanging

296
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:44,619
out. Do we like applaud those viewers by the way? They just hang out, they just watch, they just

297
01:03:44,619 --> 01:04:04,840
chill. They don't have to vote. It's time to do it. What the fuck? 95%? Are you kidding me?

298
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:20,889
I thought this was impossible. Okay. Well, all right, fine. I don't, somebody had to,

299
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:32,260
had bought a better fake that or something. There you go. That's why I don't do that with

300
01:04:32,260 --> 01:05:03,449
a camera on. I'm available, but I probably won't show up. 95%. I don't think we've ever

301
01:05:03,449 --> 01:05:19,289
seen that before. I, I've never seen a 95% with that many votes. Dude, I love this game. You know

302
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:25,369
why I love this game? Cause I can just power wash and we can talk about splatoon noises. It's

303
01:05:25,369 --> 01:06:26,440
perfect. Hashtag ad. Yeah. Hashtag ad. That's right. Copium. What? Why do you think,

304
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:36,250
when you do an iPad stream? Um, you know, I set up the iPad stream, but I just, I just didn't,

305
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:45,159
I just didn't do it because I don't know. I downloaded 50 of these wacky wild iPad games,

306
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:52,539
but I would, some of them just wouldn't open. I, I didn't want to play them off stream because

307
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:56,940
they'd want to have genuine like, what the hell's going on reactions, right? But I would open some

308
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,750
of them. And this, this became an issue where I was like, you know what, like let's just see

309
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,070
if some of them work, right? Some of them just didn't turn on. Some of them would crash after

310
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:15,929
10 seconds. And if that became not funny. So now there's going to be a new system in place.

311
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,289
This is the stream that I want to do. I want to do a stream where,

312
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:29,050
and years ago, this, this concept was, was thought up that you play an iPad game with no,

313
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:37,750
with no premium purchases. And every time an ad comes up, you download that game and move on to

314
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:53,159
that game that you see every time, no matter what, that's the game. So I think we're going

315
01:07:53,159 --> 01:08:03,670
to do that. Or you, it's because you might get an ad immediately after, after downloading one of

316
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:12,199
these. And I guess some of the rules we could make is it has to be a full page ad. It can't

317
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:15,960
just be something, a banner that pops up on the bottom or whatever, right? It's got to be a full

318
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:29,159
page ad advertising a game, a game that can be downloaded on the app store. That's the plan.

319
01:08:29,159 --> 01:09:18,630
All right. Roof is almost done. 57%. 57. I'll probably get it if I do the other side.

320
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:39,109
All right. I'm going to speed run this. Ready? Three, two, one. Um, I'm not going that fast.

321
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:57,050
Let me try. I'm not, I'm not, I can't, I, I can't go fast. Maybe I can just go fast.

322
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:14,810
I can go kind of fast. Maybe it's enough to get the, uh, the ding because the other side is,

323
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:56,569
is immaculate. Oh my God. Um, hello. Is this the grind bandits? I need some help with my

324
01:10:56,569 --> 01:11:02,149
poor little play school. Oh, another thing. Carefully go around the volcano. Wait,

325
01:11:02,149 --> 01:11:16,069
am I getting a bunch of work requests? Oh no, it's Tony Hawk. Go careful around the volcano.

326
01:11:16,069 --> 01:11:24,390
What volcano? We went down there to enjoy a smoky sunset and Jenny saw a UFO. Why am I part of this

327
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:29,029
group text? Don't fucking group text me. I'm so sick of this shit happening. Stop group texting

328
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:34,550
people. Don't pull, you know what? The dumbest fucking thing. I can't even understand how this

329
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:45,210
was ever a thing. You cannot leave a group text if there's people with iPhone and Android. Why can't

330
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:52,890
you just leave? Why can't you just leave? Just leave. I don't want to keep getting pulled in.

331
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:03,300
People will just be sitting there talking about a bunch of shit. And then at some point,

332
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,539
Hey, Jeremy, what do you, what do you thought? And I'm just like,

333
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:14,550
I don't want to tell them that I've had this whole conversation on mute for six or seven straight

334
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:36,949
weeks. Why did I give this guy my number? Hey dude, I'm going to come do a job for you. Yeah,

335
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:43,210
that sounds good. I'll come do the job for you. Here's my rate. Hey man, this is kind of an old

336
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:50,069
building. Isn't that interesting? Yes, it is very interesting. Yeah. What kind of stone do you think

337
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:56,949
they made this out of? I don't know. I'm going to get a look. I'm going to get a text. I'm going

338
01:12:56,949 --> 01:13:07,020
to be like, what's your favorite pasta? And you, you know, like rigatoni. And then it goes in the

339
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:21,140
pocket. Rigatoni in the pocket. And then this guy's going to start sending me Morse code with the

340
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:49,239
amount of times I'm going to get a message. Go finish the house first. Oh man, there's different

341
01:13:49,239 --> 01:14:03,449
levels of strength you need. Okay. Did they sell a UFO here? Dude, you came back after a year

342
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:11,050
and didn't finish. I stopped around their house, blew up one of their windows and

343
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,729
shoved the nozzle into the chimney and ruined their furniture in their living room

344
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:38,279
and then left. I'll be back in another year. And I'll put the group text thing. I don't hate text

345
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:43,239
people. I don't hate whatever. I just hate telephones. I just hate phones. You know what

346
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:47,180
is, you know, let me tell you something. Some of you kids, you know, back, back in the day,

347
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:53,100
like, you know, that everybody has a phone now, everybody will see everything they ever say,

348
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:58,470
you know what I mean? Even if you don't have read receipts on it, at least once or twice,

349
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:03,590
at least three or four potential times a day, people know that people all look at their phones

350
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:07,989
at least a few times a day. So there's no way you didn't see my text, right? There's no way you

351
01:15:07,989 --> 01:15:14,100
didn't get my phone call. See, back in the day, everyone had a landline and it would be as simple

352
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:25,539
as I don't care. I'm not answering that phone. And then it was implied that just needless weren't

353
01:15:25,539 --> 01:15:34,550
home. Or sometimes you'd pick the phone up. Hello. Hi, is, is, is, is, is Jeremy there?

354
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:51,939
And, uh, no, no, it's not here. Oh, okay. Thanks. Easy. Now everybody has a phone.

355
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:56,260
Everybody knows you have that phone. Everybody knows I have a, everybody knows you have a phone.

356
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:05,880
So you can't like, I'm so, I am very notorious for just not responding for a long fucking time.

357
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:12,060
I just, and it's not that I don't care. It's just like, oh, there's like, I don't know what to do.

358
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:32,729
I don't know what to say. I know you can set up like DND, right? Like do not disturb. And I don't

359
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:37,500
know. Shouldn't we all collectively have this message that we all agree on, right? Everyone

360
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,699
has a message that's a good, it's a separate DND box that you check. And it's just like, look,

361
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:45,899
I'm just kind of don't fucking give a shit right now. Like I, like, I don't really like want to

362
01:16:45,899 --> 01:16:49,819
answer phone calls or I guess that's what, you know, like, but like a separate, like less,

363
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:54,460
not like serious DND. Like, I just kind of don't care. Like right now, maybe like I'll get back to

364
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:01,130
you in a few days. Right? So if I get that, that we all agree on that text, right? Like it's signed

365
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:05,609
into like a Congress gets it and they sign a bill. It's just like, all right. Like we all know that

366
01:17:05,609 --> 01:17:15,989
that's like, all right. Whatever. I'll talk to you in a few days. Or no, it could be just like a

367
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:23,350
single word, like a code word. I don't like the peanuts. If you get a DND back, that's just

368
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:39,819
peanuts. All right. Yep. Got it. I got you. Don't worry. Got it. But it sucks because somebody,

369
01:17:39,819 --> 01:17:46,409
people would abuse the peanuts system, right? It'd be like, Hey, where the fuck is Jeremy?

370
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:57,579
Where is he? We got, we got peanuts. It's been, it's been three weeks and he won't respond about us

371
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:01,750
going to dinner on Thursday. Like what the hell do you just, you're abusing the peanut system.

372
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:09,750
And then finally get back to him. You're like, Oh yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I just, I kind of was like,

373
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:21,640
dude, I was busy and shit. And I didn't really, no one actually cares this much if you don't

374
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:33,989
respond. You know what? That's, that's pretty accurate. But still though, I, I never want

375
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:42,460
people to think I don't care. I do care, but like sometimes I'll get a text and then I'll have

376
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:51,529
like Kathy Mitchell on the iPad. And it's just like, fuck, but I don't even know. I,

377
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:02,630
and for some reason, my brain says, just press play again and just relax. It sucks. I hate it.

378
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:12,390
Cause in my brain, in my, my, I don't know, maybe I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I'm weird,

379
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:17,989
but to me putting on like DND to me and like sending a DND automatic response back to somebody

380
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:24,840
is almost like a, huh. Okay. Automatic response. Not going to even text me back. I get like an

381
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:31,619
auto response, auto generated message. Like, Hey, what are you up to? I'm sorry. That person is not

382
01:19:31,619 --> 01:19:54,220
available to speak right now. Maybe he'll talk to you later. Okay. Sure. Auto generated. And let

383
01:19:54,220 --> 01:20:01,979
me, let me be also frank too. I talk to a lot of people every day. I'm usually on the phone

384
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:15,300
at least four or five times a day. That's a flex. What is a flex? I just talked to a lot of

385
01:20:15,300 --> 01:21:00,409
different people. Weird flex. Uh, what are my favorite color schemes by the way? He talks to

386
01:21:00,409 --> 01:21:11,220
people, but he doesn't, he never wants to talk back to people. No, I don't just want to talk

387
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:16,819
at people. And so it's like, when I call you, you answer. When I text you, you answer. I, I get it

388
01:21:16,819 --> 01:21:19,859
too. If I don't get a response, I'm just like, all right, cool. I'll see you. I'll talk to you.

389
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:28,729
Whatever. I'm not demanding that they give me their time. I'm just saying that I have, you know what

390
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:50,010
I mean? You get it. You missed a spot. This one's going to take a while. It's this, this is, oh,

391
01:21:57,939 --> 01:22:00,979
so you know what I could do here, right? Check this out. All right. You ready?

392
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:24,279
Make sure that looks good. Okay. So right here, I could take a picture right here,

393
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:34,039
just of this, me standing in front of it, being like, it's like, yeah, just cleaning it up. But,

394
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:41,460
at Dave's skate park, really showing him how to do a clean job, right? Arms folded like this.

395
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:45,220
And the power washers leaning behind me. And there's an ad for my business right there.

396
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:51,939
And what they don't know is that I just, this is all this. And I get to about here

397
01:22:52,579 --> 01:23:06,470
and I'm just like, I'm done. There's some dirt still on the wall. Oh yeah. Take the photo here

398
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:10,149
and have me stand there and then crop the absolute hell out of this and zoom in so it's

399
01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:16,020
looking blurry and artifacted. And then somebody gets the original photo and leaks the original

400
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:26,119
photo. Now, is that a dumb viral marketing campaign that would be bad for my business or

401
01:23:28,789 --> 01:24:17,029
what? I wonder. It would be such an epic troll. Still 1%. Oh God. Use the big nozzle.

402
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:25,989
The big nozzle doesn't get everything. Do I have access to different nozzles?

403
01:24:32,039 --> 01:24:44,060
Is there a bigger one? Where can I buy stuff? Is there a store? How do I buy something?

404
01:24:44,060 --> 01:25:06,409
Where's the store? It's somewhere, right? Where is it? Oh, right here. Oh, all right. Okay. Heavy

405
01:25:06,409 --> 01:25:27,289
duty. Shit. I need 40 stars. Dude, these. Oh my God. There's there's like skins. Oh, all right.

406
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:37,109
Hold on. I don't want to spend any money though. No, I don't want to spend any money. Should I get

407
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:47,180
some soap? What kind of surface is this? Is this plastic? What is this? Steel? Granite? What is this?

408
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:58,579
What is it? Aluminum or something? What is all this? Concrete? Oh, it says multi-purpose. Okay.

409
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:14,279
So I need multi-purpose cleaner. Multi-purpose. Should I have bought that much? All right. So now

410
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:25,779
what does that do? Okay. Now how do I put the cleaning liquid on? No cleaner attached. How do

411
01:26:25,779 --> 01:26:49,640
I do that? I have like five. Press three. Oh, okay. Cool. Is it on? Multi-purpose cleaner. I have to

412
01:26:49,640 --> 01:27:17,159
buy the attachment. You need the soap nozzle. Oh, okay. 75 bucks. I already own it. Change to it.

413
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:28,630
You own it for the other washer. Oh, it's for the other one. Wait, what? Oh, really? Hold on.

414
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:40,220
I can't get it for the other one. Huh. Okay. So that's for the other one. Well, let me try it.

415
01:27:40,220 --> 01:28:10,300
Give me the stub. Stubby. All right. What's this doing? I can get it for the other gun.

416
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:15,000
This actually kind of works. All right. Wait. Get it for the other gun. How much money do I have?

417
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:45,500
Okay. So clean power equipment, right? Oh, $375. I don't have enough for that. I might as well use it.

418
01:28:45,500 --> 01:29:23,859
So this just makes it easier to do. Rinse it. Finish the house. I'll go back in a year. I'll

419
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:36,390
go back in like a year. This doesn't do anything. That is way more than I've done in an hour sitting

420
01:29:36,390 --> 01:30:03,750
in the corner. This is doing way more than I was doing. Now rinse it. Do I have to rinse it?

421
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:18,010
I don't think so. No. I'm going to use the rest of it. Should I go? All right. Should I go back

422
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:20,890
to the house? All right. I'll go back. I'll go back to the house. I'll go back to the house.

423
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:32,619
I'll come back to this one later. I'll be fine. Soap only gets most of it off the weaker one. Okay.

424
01:30:32,619 --> 01:30:42,819
Hey, look at this place. This place looks beautiful. So this is wood. Does multi-purpose

425
01:30:42,819 --> 01:31:11,989
work on wood? Probably not, right? That's actually really good here. All right. Give me the ladder.

426
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:24,579
Can I put the ladder over here? I can't. What the hell am I doing? Oh my god. That's so much

427
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:35,720
easier. All right. I almost have the whole chimney. This doesn't work. That doesn't work here.

428
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:59,210
It works on the chimney. Oh, my ladder is not big enough. The ladder is not big enough to get all

429
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:17,899
the way up here. This side, the one facing the neighbor here. Jeremy, are you high on bath salts?

430
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:30,010
No. What? There it is. Got it. Okay. Now I want wood. I want wood cleaner. I feel like it's going

431
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:40,380
to be amazing. Stone cleaner. No. All right. Let me buy some wood cleaner. Wood cleaner.

432
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:48,760
There it is. Let's see if this works. Wood cleaner. It's on. Fill it up and let's go.

433
01:32:52,619 --> 01:33:05,500
Works pretty good. Maybe it has got a great sound effect too. That's got an amazing sound effect.

434
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:16,439
Get off the fucking ladder, you idiot. What have I done? I just like ran into it and hit my head on

435
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:53,300
it. Looking good so far. Just leave an outline of the ladder. That would be so stupid. All right.

436
01:33:53,300 --> 01:34:14,119
I got to go for the corner here. That's all right. Now we move the ladder. Actually, maybe not.

437
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:28,600
Hell, this is the way to do it. This is the way to do it. For sure. I still have cleaner left,

438
01:34:28,600 --> 01:35:01,510
right? Yep. That took me two minutes. Two minutes. Perfect. All right. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

439
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:14,409
All right. Move the ladder. Come on. Come on. Crap. It's okay. It'll ding any second.

440
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:34,649
That just scared the shit out of me. All right. Any more soap I can use. This is multi-purpose.

441
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:41,369
These are the railing. Okay. This is how is this? This is wood. Okay. It's all. Oh yeah. Let's refill

442
01:35:41,369 --> 01:36:00,020
that. Yep. Fill it back up. Buy some more of that right now. Let's buy it all. Whatever. Check this

443
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:17,500
out. I'm spending money. How much money am I spending? Oh, that was 50 bucks. I'll make it

444
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:39,819
last and then I'll come back and just and touch it up. I'll touch it up. How's this wood? This looks

445
01:36:39,819 --> 01:36:48,409
like stone. This is wood. Don't walk under the ladder. It's all right. I'll throw a fucking salt

446
01:36:48,409 --> 01:36:58,710
behind me. I'll be fine. I'm asking a question. So if I walked under a ladder and okay, if I walked

447
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:04,390
through the ladder, but I walked backwards through the ladder, does that, does that negate it?

448
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:09,319
Does that let you say, okay, you went back, you undued. Does that, is that an undo?

449
01:37:12,949 --> 01:37:19,260
No. Okay. So if I go through the ladder, then I take salt and I go like that. Wait, wrong shoulder

450
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:34,659
like that. Would that undo going through the ladder? No, it doesn't. It's the salt has no effect.

451
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:50,569
So what would negate going underneath the ladder? Nothing. Nothing. You literally nothing you do.

452
01:37:51,369 --> 01:37:55,609
I feel like there's something you can do. You don't. That's not how it works.

453
01:37:56,329 --> 01:38:07,180
What's wrong with going under a ladder? Somebody tell them. Somebody tell that. Somebody tell

454
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:19,699
that guy. Somebody tell them. It's 100 years bad luck. So if you walked under a ladder,

455
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:24,979
broke a mirror, threw salt over your left shoulder, opened up an umbrella, closed it,

456
01:38:24,979 --> 01:38:40,390
opened up an umbrella. Do you just get struck by lightning right after doing that? It's a cheat

457
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:52,970
code. It's funny because I'm not superstitious at all. But I doesn't matter. I still wouldn't

458
01:38:53,689 --> 01:39:06,680
open up an umbrella inside the house. Right. But I'm not super I don't I'm not I just just in case.

459
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:17,779
What if just in case like I would not right now open a umbrella in this room. I just it's

460
01:39:17,779 --> 01:39:22,180
not that oh my god, I believe in that. But I just I don't know. I'm afraid of it. What if it's real?

461
01:39:22,979 --> 01:39:36,229
What if it is bad luck? This house looks like shit. All right, we got all I soaked it up.

462
01:39:36,229 --> 01:39:44,619
Is there any more what I can do? This is now this is multi-purpose. All right, well get rid of the

463
01:39:44,619 --> 01:39:52,779
the wood one. Now we're gonna bring the nozzle back out. Okay, I would clean it. Let's put the

464
01:39:52,779 --> 01:40:07,300
nozzles back on. I want where's where's my actual where's it? What? Oh, how do I get to the nozzle?

465
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:16,409
There we go. All right, medium duty. This one has extension though. I'm gonna put this one on.

466
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:28,500
I have to piss. Can I go pee? I gotta pee. I'll be right back. I gotta pee. And I'm finishing this

467
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:35,140
house and I'm finishing the gosh darn state skate park. I'll be right back. I'm gonna pee.

468
01:42:30,760 --> 01:45:08,229
All right, I'm back. How are you? How's it going? You guys ready for more power washing? Oh, yeah.

469
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:19,029
You forgot to mute. We heard every last drop. You're disgusting. You're disgusting. Disgusting.

470
01:45:19,109 --> 01:45:24,810
Disgusting chatter. Disgusting chatter. Disgusting chatter. Get rid of them. Disgusting chatter.

471
01:45:37,210 --> 01:45:46,090
All right, let's do it. Back to the house. How much more of the house do I have to do?

472
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:54,039
Realistically, I'm at 73%. Do I get extra money for finishing the job?

473
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:07,350
I better. This got louder to me. Have I just gotten used to that sound? Did I get used to

474
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:17,590
that sound effect? What about baseball? Baseball. The German Baseball Association had its date

475
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:26,039
changed to August 19th. I know, Saj is in the chat. I know. But that is set in stone.

476
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:45,100
We're ready to go. This time, I mean it. This time, I mean it. You said that last time. Yeah,

477
01:46:45,100 --> 01:47:01,020
but this would be, this would be strike three. This would be literally strike three. Set in stone.

478
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:11,189
It's no, it's set in stone. This has been etched into an etch a sketch. So you can just literally

479
01:47:11,189 --> 01:47:39,220
go like this and it just changes. Dang. He's going to delay it again. I know I can't. So

480
01:47:39,939 --> 01:47:47,539
if this gets delayed again, it's not going to happen till probably the fall. There's no way.

481
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:56,699
There is not a chance it gets delayed again. And I'm telling you, there's no way. No way. No way.

482
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:08,810
No way. There is literally no way. I know that's, that's copium, but there's no way.

483
01:48:21,699 --> 01:48:30,710
Tag me. Oh yeah, that's, somebody has an account that says that. Somebody has an account that's

484
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:40,819
tag me when Jerma lies. That person has probably not logged into Twitch in like five years. That

485
01:48:40,819 --> 01:48:59,670
account is probably inactive. It's probably been inactive for months, if not years. They were here

486
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:13,640
yesterday. They're actually here. Well, whoever this is, they're going to wake up one day and have

487
01:49:14,359 --> 01:49:27,430
5,000 pings on their dashboard. You know what? I can't even buy anymore. Nevermind.

488
01:49:41,939 --> 01:49:52,329
How does anyone know what the stream is? What do you mean? What happened? What happened?

489
01:49:52,329 --> 01:50:10,659
Can you explain why it got delayed? Sure. One, two, three. It could have happened on that date,

490
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:14,899
but it would have been a show that was worse than the show I wanted to do.

491
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:20,229
Uh, we were pretty much ready to go. We had a couple of issues

492
01:50:21,270 --> 01:50:28,920
that we had some, uh, some of the, some venue problems, right? So instead of just doing it

493
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:35,399
with those venue problems, I was like, you know what? Let's just make sure that we can do

494
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:46,340
the thing that I want to do. Uh, it would have been fine maybe, but after August and into September,

495
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:53,930
I'm going to be able to look back and go, I'm so glad we waited till August.

496
01:50:53,930 --> 01:51:01,479
This whole process of trying to get, um, a venue, right, was way more difficult than I think anybody

497
01:51:01,479 --> 01:51:09,510
anticipated. So we got one, then we got another one. Then we got told we couldn't do it at one

498
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:14,260
place. Then we got told we couldn't do it at another place. And then we had a date and then

499
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:18,260
that date had to change with this place. And so then we had to look and see if we could go

500
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:24,890
somewhere else. And it was like, no, I don't want to do that. So we ended up picking a new place

501
01:51:25,770 --> 01:51:46,329
for August. It's pretty much what happened, but it's going to be, it's going to be a lot of fun.

502
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:53,220
I've been waiting to do this stream for almost two years. So when we finally get out there,

503
01:51:55,180 --> 01:52:10,140
I'm going to be as happy as can be. Ding. All right. At what point can I close the job? 80%,

504
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:20,069
90%, 100%? When do I, when do I get to go? All right. That's it. You're on your own.

505
01:52:20,069 --> 01:52:34,409
A hundred. Oh, all right. I'm focusing. Here we go. Focus up. Focus up. Always give 110%

506
01:52:34,409 --> 01:52:56,500
Jerry. How long are you going to stream today? Um, I don't know. As long as I feel like it.

507
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:06,550
Don't mean to be a Debbie downer, but I've looked into the creepy symbols you found on

508
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:15,659
the side of that house you're working on. It's the demon person. It turns out that just

509
01:53:15,659 --> 01:53:31,420
builder's diagrams to, Oh, telling the plumber where to put the gap for the overfill. Nevermind.

510
01:53:36,819 --> 01:53:59,109
Nevermind. 80%. Is this the first job I will ever complete in this game? Especially a different

511
01:53:59,109 --> 01:54:03,909
nozzle. I, I, yeah, but I like the green one. The green one is just enough pressure, but it's not

512
01:54:03,909 --> 01:54:17,699
too much. This one has a good surface area, but it doesn't, it doesn't get down deep and you have

513
01:54:17,699 --> 01:54:24,069
to pass through three times anyways. Hey, can you do the cat puke noise? Um, what is that?

514
01:54:24,949 --> 01:54:33,159
What the, what are you talking about? I'm a sponsored fucking stream. Shut up.

515
01:54:45,220 --> 01:55:20,329
That looks all right. Call for a vote. What are we voting on? This thing goes, this is the long

516
01:55:20,329 --> 01:55:23,529
range nozzle. That's what's going on here. I was like, Holy shit. This is awesome.

517
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:33,350
Why did I not have someone from the very beginning? I could do the whole house like this.

518
01:55:45,779 --> 01:55:50,920
That's so much. All right. This will be done in 10 minutes. Not even a poll to do cat puke. No,

519
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:56,949
that's on, that's on me. If I want to do that, whatever that is, whatever that could be,

520
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:02,420
that's something I've never heard of, whatever that is. I don't know. It's something strange.

521
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:32,649
Apparently nice. So much quicker. Come on, just get, wait, I can use the, uh, the, the spinner.

522
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:41,609
This is my favorite weapon. Well, it's not a weapon, but you know what I mean? It's my favorite

523
01:56:41,609 --> 01:56:59,720
attachment. I would say I don't call it a weapon. It's not a weapon. Favorite weapon.

524
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:37,239
Got it. Plus that's two bucks. That's two bucks. Two bucks. Almost at 90%. Let's go. Let's go.

525
01:57:37,239 --> 01:58:01,899
Let's go. Let's go. I was puked. Yeah. I was just, I was cat puked. You're right.

526
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:27,109
How much more of this did before I get a ding? I'm being dead serious. There it is. I get it

527
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:52,329
underneath. Ding. Looks so much better. So much better. Can we see the before and after photos?

528
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:58,090
What a difference. What a difference that made, huh? What a change. What a difference.

529
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:55,609
What a difference. What? When is this going to ding? Somebody said, why are you so tall?

530
01:59:56,779 --> 02:00:16,039
Holy shit. He's huge. I just realized I'm seven plus feet tall. What? There it is.

531
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:21,779
There's the ding. By the way, can we, uh, in the chat, can we tell everybody where they can get

532
02:00:21,779 --> 02:00:30,680
this power wash simulator? Where can you get it? And by the way, I got a terrible job I've done.

533
02:00:32,649 --> 02:00:39,369
What an awful job I've done. Imagine if you could show me up

534
02:00:39,369 --> 02:01:24,710
on your own game. Just your fucking like two year old. I'm 90% sure it's on Xbox. You're right.

535
02:01:24,710 --> 02:01:35,420
Xbox X. Xbox Series S. Steam. It's on that PC of yours. I believe it's also on Game Pass.

536
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:39,420
Potentially two. We're, we have, we've got a Corob. We've got to figure that one out.

537
02:01:40,380 --> 02:02:02,659
Ding. More dings. Yeah, it's on Game Pass. Yes. You just downloaded from Game Pass? Hell yeah.

538
02:02:03,300 --> 02:03:03,270
260. What do I need? 375? I want a different nozzle. Oh, what did I do? You made somebody

539
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:08,229
cry. I made somebody cry at Dave and Buster's. You made my little sister cry at Dave and Buster's.

540
02:03:08,229 --> 02:03:13,109
You called her crying Andy and she cried. I'm nice. Just delete this. What is this?

541
02:03:13,829 --> 02:03:39,510
Do I still not? Okay, come on. There it is. All right. What is missing on this side? This

542
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:42,069
side looks good besides this. This looks awful, but you know, whatever. It's fine.

543
02:03:43,029 --> 02:04:36,810
Wait, you can get this on Steam Deck? That wasn't a bad first pass. Come on. Why does it feel like

544
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:42,630
this setting? I would be like, I wouldn't be able to control this. I'd be, my arm would be moving

545
02:04:42,630 --> 02:05:01,609
all. This is a lot of power behind this. Do this to your house in real life. There it is. All right.

546
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:29,300
Wait, this side too. 90%. Come on. It's just the roof. Get in there. Nice.

547
02:05:38,859 --> 02:05:45,619
I haven't got a ding in a while. Kind of getting a little pissed off about it, if I'm honest.

548
02:05:45,619 --> 02:06:17,029
Can you get this on a Samsung fridge? Why is there just a, I don't know. I don't know if you

549
02:06:17,029 --> 02:06:23,500
can get this on a fridge. That has not been play tested. I don't think so. That's at your own risk.

550
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:58,250
It's fridge compatible. Have you, did you do it? They said it's fridge compatible. Pog.

551
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:05,319
That's not official. That's not an official statement. That's one, one guy in chat said that.

552
02:07:05,319 --> 02:07:26,579
I don't know. I don't know what that means. How did I not do this already? This hedge ruined

553
02:07:26,579 --> 02:07:47,720
everything. Come on. Really? All right. Oh, oh, I, that was supposed to be a joke, but that actually

554
02:07:47,720 --> 02:08:09,029
just died. Did that for real. That hurt. That did that for a joke. Flatter. Now it's just the roof,

555
02:08:09,029 --> 02:08:38,869
right? And that's it. Broke your finger. I'm fine. It didn't even hurt. This was blowing out my

556
02:08:38,869 --> 02:08:48,810
microphone, right? Cause that was disgusting. That definitely covered it up. I just did like

557
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:54,470
this internal burp and it was like, and this, I'm glad you didn't hear it because this, yeah.

558
02:09:05,979 --> 02:09:10,060
Thank God I have this loud white noise just playing in the background. So you didn't hear that.

559
02:09:21,909 --> 02:09:52,439
He farted. I didn't stop saying that. What's left up here? Oh, the gutter, right? Can I hold shift

560
02:09:52,439 --> 02:10:37,479
and not fall off like Minecraft? This is really, really on there. This is algae. Is that, was it

561
02:10:37,479 --> 02:10:58,420
algae? Is it, it looks like, did I get it all? There's still some here. Hold on. Let me crouch.

562
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:17,109
I got it all. Oh, that's actually a really good angle for this. You're floating. No, I've got,

563
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:26,550
I'm out of the way at the end. My, my big toe is over here. I'm fine. This is a, this angle is

564
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:46,470
perfect though. You can get all up in there. Okay. There's nothing else over here. 92%. All right. I

565
02:11:46,470 --> 02:12:19,659
got to get the algae in there. I already got all that. Not over here though. Hold on. Ding. No ding.

566
02:12:33,029 --> 02:13:11,260
Where's the ding? No ding. Dude, no ding. No ding. Here we go. All right. I'm in. This is, yeah,

567
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:34,260
this is algae. All right. What is left besides the very top of the roof here? This, oh, that looks

568
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:56,710
bad. What, besides this, there's nothing else. There's a whole left wall. Bro, that's a shadow.

569
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:31,829
Bro, 303. Do I get, do I actually get a bonus for this? If I do, if I complete the whole thing,

570
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:53,560
you've been doing this for two hours. Yeah, I'm having fun. It gives you a message. Oh, I got it.

571
02:14:53,560 --> 02:15:57,960
40 bucks. Hell yeah. Come on. I want to buy that new nozzle. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Ding. Real voice.

572
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:05,350
You know, let me, let me talk in my real voice. I'm going to talk just in my real voice. No messing

573
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:12,569
around. No like putting on a projection to talk into a microphone or talk. So this is what I just,

574
02:16:12,569 --> 02:16:16,659
this is what I normally talk like. This is how I just normally speak to somebody. If I'm talking

575
02:16:16,659 --> 02:16:21,460
to somebody, this is how I just normally will talk. I'll be like, what's up, man? What are you

576
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:27,430
up to? Nothing. I, you, you, are you doing that thing on a, on Friday? I was thinking about going,

577
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:41,239
but I'm not sure. Are you, um, yeah. Are you, uh, I can pick you up and pick it up at like,

578
02:16:41,239 --> 02:16:53,030
like eight. No. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. I mean, we can get a, we can get a breakfast if you want.

579
02:16:53,030 --> 02:17:01,540
We can just get breakfast and shit. I was going to do it again, but I'm like, nah,

580
02:17:01,540 --> 02:18:01,049
I'm not doing it again. 95%, 96%. It's just this side right here. That's it. 97, 98, 99. Oh,

581
02:18:01,049 --> 02:19:06,760
it's coming. Come on. 99 still. 100. You thought dirt and grime could hide from me? This is where

582
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:12,139
it shows like a bunch of animated dirt and they're all hiding under the railing. He'll never get us

583
02:19:12,139 --> 02:19:25,020
here. We're caked on algae. And then it blasts. Our washers use the strongest nozzles able to take

584
02:19:25,020 --> 02:19:49,430
six coats of paint off. Our nozzles are so strong. We can turn steel back to its original element,

585
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:54,139
iron and copper. It splits the atoms or whatever it does. What? Wait, what is it? What is steel?

586
02:19:55,219 --> 02:19:57,940
Carbon. Fuck. I fucked that whole joke up. You know what I mean though.

587
02:20:00,409 --> 02:20:04,409
Iron and copper. I've been playing too many mobile games, guys. It's one bar of copper,

588
02:20:04,409 --> 02:20:18,969
one bar of iron, and you put them together and it turns into steel. Window frames? Where are these

589
02:20:18,969 --> 02:20:33,559
trims? Wooden trim. There it is. How do you make steel? Steel is aluminum. Okay, so what's a better

590
02:20:33,559 --> 02:20:41,559
joke? I can bring a material that's combined metals down to their periodic table version.

591
02:20:45,450 --> 02:20:52,229
Carbon and iron. So a better thing would be like, our nozzles are so strong. Our nozzles are so

592
02:20:52,229 --> 02:21:13,430
strong. We can turn steel back into carbon and iron. Would that be better? Why did you say

593
02:21:13,430 --> 02:21:25,399
copper? Why did you say carbon and iron? Split bronze into copper and tin. Did I get it wrong?

594
02:21:35,209 --> 02:22:05,770
No, you were correct. Left side window. Ah, 99. I'm so stressed out. Relax. We're fine. Rail. Oh,

595
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:37,159
here we go. A nozzle like this would fuck this up. Probably. Iron and carbon is steel. Steel is

596
02:22:37,159 --> 02:22:51,799
mostly iron. It's about 98% iron. All right. So I wasn't wrong. I physically can't get over here.

597
02:22:52,520 --> 02:23:23,430
Hold on. Yes, I can. Another railing. More window trims. Oh, come on. Wait, that's it. All right.

598
02:23:23,430 --> 02:23:36,659
Now window trim. You should say it splits atoms. Well, it's like an image of the guy shooting the

599
02:23:36,659 --> 02:23:46,729
power washer. He's like, and it's just all of a sudden you see like a mushroom cloud. I don't

600
02:23:46,729 --> 02:24:00,180
think I would want that. Window trim. Yeah, these were like, there's a couple windows here.

601
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:12,040
Up here. No, not this one. Wooden trim. Oh, it's not window trim. It's wooden trim.

602
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:50,409
Wooden trim and railing. Which railing? This one? There it is. Shit, I gotta go down here. I'm

603
02:24:50,409 --> 02:25:23,579
almost at 100. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Only a few more. And I got 100% on the house.

604
02:25:34,139 --> 02:26:02,579
Very nice. There's three more. Where? Where? Last one. Extra 100 bucks. And we gotta get our,

605
02:26:02,579 --> 02:26:19,129
hold on. We gotta do our post shave rinse, right? That looks good. Get the bladder out of the way.

606
02:26:19,129 --> 02:26:41,049
I want a picture. Okay. No, wait. It's your perspective. So it'd be like this. Hey. All

607
02:26:41,049 --> 02:26:47,290
right. Wait, this is from a year ago. This is literally from a year ago. The front part.

608
02:26:47,290 --> 02:27:06,309
It's saved for a year. Wait, hold on. It actually kept it from a year ago. Why? Hold on. But why did

609
02:27:06,309 --> 02:27:21,639
I exist later? How come I was walking around? Who is this walking around? They grew up so fast.

610
02:27:21,639 --> 02:27:36,469
All right. I got some money now. Let's go back to the skate park. Steel is iron. All right. Here

611
02:27:36,469 --> 02:27:47,959
we go. They added a player model and a patch. Oh, that's funny. Okay. Here we go. Update the nozzle.

612
02:27:47,959 --> 02:27:58,709
You think it's time? Heavy duty. $2,000. I don't have that. Five grand. All right. I'm not

613
02:27:58,709 --> 02:28:05,559
fucking around anymore. I'm not messing around anymore. We need to get money. Let's go. Ready?

614
02:28:09,909 --> 02:28:14,620
Um, I need, I need some, I need some, I need some go fast music.

615
02:28:16,659 --> 02:28:24,040
Multipurpose. I'm going to soak the whole thing. You ready? No, not doom. OST. Something that is

616
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:35,530
royalty free. It's gotta be something royalty free. Is penis music royalty free? Definitely not. I

617
02:28:35,530 --> 02:28:45,450
don't know why. That's what I wanted to put on here. Put on Sonic X. Is that so? I mean,

618
02:28:45,450 --> 02:29:01,940
it's video game music, right? Whatever. Put on the Flintstones SNES. All right. Hold on. Let me,

619
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:16,440
let me get something. Let's do, um, what do you think? No, not break core. Why would Sonic

620
02:29:16,440 --> 02:29:28,180
doesn't make sense? Put on the one Sonic song and just put it on repeat. Flintstones SNES. I'm so,

621
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:37,940
what, I'm curious of what this is. What is this Flintstones SNES? OST. I've never played this

622
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:51,559
game before. Flintstones? By the way, this is the movie version of the Flintstones.

623
02:29:55,190 --> 02:30:01,579
Holy shit. This is a fucking awesome. What the hell? Who made this? This is great.

624
02:30:10,170 --> 02:30:18,100
Oh, hold on. Let's start this over. When you meet the Flintstones, your own new story.

625
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:39,020
Let's do that one more time. This just blows it out. Hold on. The skin on my mouth is coming off.

626
02:30:50,579 --> 02:30:58,569
Why am I doing this? No, let's go over here. I need soap. What just happened?

627
02:30:59,129 --> 02:31:07,100
This sounds like a really shitty version of this because of the white noise.

628
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:27,850
How long are they gonna hold? I can hold the will before.

629
02:32:16,629 --> 02:32:26,680
Fucking long, dude. How long was that? That was at least like 30 seconds.

630
02:32:30,409 --> 02:32:39,350
That had to have been at least 20 to 30 seconds. That was a flash. You flash banged us.

631
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:59,659
Is this Fred Flintstone? Dude, did I get the longest Wilma world record right there?

632
02:33:04,819 --> 02:33:19,430
All right. I want to buy the soap. Multi-purpose. This song is amazing.

633
02:33:27,590 --> 02:33:40,139
Shit. I'm spending money. That was like a minute. That was 45 seconds.

634
02:33:45,799 --> 02:34:15,860
What? Based on the clip, that was 45 straight seconds. Do I submit that somewhere? All right.

635
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:24,569
I don't want wood cleaner. I want multi-purpose cleaner. The soundtrack is actually really good.

636
02:34:24,569 --> 02:34:33,579
All right. I'm gonna start. Let's get this whole quadrant done like from here to here.

637
02:34:33,579 --> 02:34:58,440
I'm gonna draw a line essentially. So from here to here. Ready? This OST fucks. It does. Hey,

638
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:11,860
we're playing Power War Simulator. Check it out. This actually cleans it really well.

639
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:35,799
Multi-purpose still, right? Yep. Oh, that's a dirty steak. I want to check out some of

640
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:38,709
the other little modes too. There's a couple of the modes I want to see.

641
02:35:38,709 --> 02:35:49,559
Okay. After the skate park, I'll check out some of the other modes. I'm actually going to really

642
02:35:49,559 --> 02:36:03,940
try to get this done quickly. Quadrant by quadrant. I don't want to go too far. I'm going too far now.

643
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:15,190
Already is looking way better. Right here. There's the line right here. We're going to

644
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:26,579
go over this again with the actual nozzle. And from this line, I'm going to draw the line here.

645
02:36:26,579 --> 02:36:36,459
Ready? Okay. Do not cross this line. If I cross that line before doing the rest of it, right?

646
02:36:36,459 --> 02:36:44,889
I'm going to do it right here. Let's make, let's draw it. See? In here. If I start going over that

647
02:36:44,889 --> 02:37:01,459
line and I like, oh yes, let me tell you a story. So, um, I'm in trouble. Quadrant by quadrant.

648
02:37:01,459 --> 02:37:30,979
Nothing else. I'm good. I'm not over the line. This, the line is right at the edge of this wall.

649
02:37:30,979 --> 02:37:39,430
I'm going to leave a little bit of dirt so I don't, uh, so I can see where the line is still.

650
02:37:52,840 --> 02:38:02,010
Okay. That's all right right now. Let's get this edge over here. And as fast as you can say,

651
02:38:02,010 --> 02:38:19,479
bops your uncle, boppies your aunt, I have a delicious virgin strawberry daiquiri. All right.

652
02:38:19,479 --> 02:38:42,090
This one's good. Now we're going to go in the corner. Perfect. Minus two. Stop immediately.

653
02:38:43,659 --> 02:39:04,059
No, I don't think I will. Actually, yeah, I will. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't miss anything. Just

654
02:39:04,059 --> 02:39:11,270
go slow. If you take your time, you don't have to spend more time added on top, going back and

655
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:18,180
doing this again. If you spend the extra time to make sure it's done now, you don't have to come

656
02:39:18,180 --> 02:39:42,260
back and do it again. Efficiency. Don't steal that joke. There's a bunch of, there's a shit

657
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:47,780
load of people here that don't know me really. Hey, did you guys know? Don't steal that joke.

658
02:39:47,780 --> 02:39:54,819
I'm going to do it. Did you guys know that every day you eat over an inch of dirt every meal,

659
02:39:55,620 --> 02:40:04,200
every single day? Isn't that insane? Did you know that? You eat over an inch of dirt every single

660
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:09,559
day. It's crazy. Isn't that like kind of gross? It's that's a weird statistic. Don't you think

661
02:40:15,659 --> 02:40:18,540
speak for yourself? No, everybody does it. We all do. Every single person

662
02:40:19,020 --> 02:40:28,540
eats over an inch of dirt a day. I mean, you got to be sitting at a table. You got to be at

663
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:58,700
least a few inches off the ground eating that food, don't you? What's the joke? That is the joke.

664
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:27,579
We're not listening. I don't get it. I'm not outside the line. This is, look, the line's right

665
02:41:27,579 --> 02:41:50,620
there. You clown. The line's right here. See? Hot, hot, hot, hot. Somebody wrote in all caps,

666
02:41:50,620 --> 02:41:55,420
what are you talking about? I don't know how it was. Is it really this hard to follow this

667
02:41:55,420 --> 02:42:06,950
conversation? Sometimes I feel like you guys act like you're changing channels. Like,

668
02:42:08,549 --> 02:42:27,270
and then here we are. We got. All right. I'm focusing on this railing and I'm going to make

669
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:55,459
sure it's done well. Play with the ball. I can't leave. I can't cross that. I cannot cross that

670
02:42:55,459 --> 02:43:17,899
line. Not until everything here is clean. Can't do it. Do I turn the music up? Turn the music up.

671
02:43:17,899 --> 02:43:23,530
I'll turn everything. I'll turn everything up. That goes up a little and the wash sounds would

672
02:43:23,530 --> 02:44:01,420
go up a little too. A little up. A little up. That's fine. You need to do a monkey impression.

673
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:33,879
Why? For what? All right. This railing's almost done. Am I going to get dinged for the railing

674
02:44:33,879 --> 02:44:47,940
or is this not a ding? Is this not a dingable object? There it is. Okay. Don't leave the line.

675
02:44:47,940 --> 02:45:08,090
Do it because you love us. Where did you get that idea? This is still in the line. The line ends

676
02:45:08,090 --> 02:45:15,030
over there. I'm not going to do a monkey sound. Oh, okay. You're hearing it. That looks good up

677
02:45:15,030 --> 02:45:40,010
there so far. All right. That's good. Now I'm just going to do the stairs and that should take this

678
02:45:40,010 --> 02:45:55,979
whole wall down. By the way, Power Wash Simulator is currently in 1.0. Just released into 1.0 today.

679
02:45:58,090 --> 02:46:02,600
After a while in early access. It's available for you to download right now.

680
02:46:03,159 --> 02:46:08,100
Free to go get it on various platforms. It's driven today's sponsor, of course.

681
02:46:08,739 --> 02:46:30,069
We laugh at all your dumb jokes but you won't even do a monkey sound. Don't you think that is a dumb

682
02:46:30,069 --> 02:46:41,219
joke? If I were to just start doing a chimpanzee sound effect, that's dumb. Why would I be doing

683
02:46:41,219 --> 02:47:06,579
that? What's my motivation? Direct me. What's the motivation? Not bad because you've done it before.

684
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:35,620
I love this half pipe. I love the watermelon. Dude, if I owned this park, they would be a

685
02:47:35,620 --> 02:47:41,930
watermelon scented plug-in or something or watermelon scented spray that we sprayed

686
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:50,600
all around the place and then open the park. People would come over here and be like,

687
02:47:51,659 --> 02:48:13,479
what? Oh my, dude, it's watermelons. It would be awesome. I gotta slow it down. This song is good.

688
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:26,440
Who recommended this? Because it's actually fantastic. Should I play the Flintstones SNES

689
02:48:26,440 --> 02:49:20,520
game? Sure. It's probably gonna ding here in a minute. Oh, that was a good line. Come on,

690
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:49,020
let's see it ding. Ding. Ding. Let's see it ding. This mold on the wall? Yeah, I know but I'm doing

691
02:49:49,020 --> 02:50:03,639
the pool. Whatever this thing is. Yes. All right, that's done. This wall over here now. All right,

692
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:17,940
don't freak out. I think I can go wider here. Yeah, here it is. Yeah, it's the Flintstones SNES

693
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:55,700
soundtrack. No monkey, no buy. So what you're implying that if I do a monkey sound, you will

694
02:50:55,700 --> 02:51:12,250
buy this game. Powerwatch simulator available on Xbox S, Xbox X, Steam, Game Pass. So that's what

695
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:34,889
you're saying? Liars. You should be getting the game because it's a quality fun game with really,

696
02:51:34,889 --> 02:51:39,690
really, don't look at my lips. I just spit out something weird. It was gross. It was disgusting,

697
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:44,729
whatever that was. You should be buying this game because it's a fun relaxing simulator of washing

698
02:51:45,370 --> 02:51:52,059
stuff. That's what you should be doing. It was a piece of spaghetti.

699
02:51:55,219 --> 02:52:01,049
How would you have spaghetti stuck in your teeth? That's not, it's pasta. It's impossible.

700
02:52:02,620 --> 02:52:09,620
You don't have spaghetti stuck in your teeth. That will disintegrate over time. Not like a piece of

701
02:52:09,620 --> 02:52:52,200
broccoli. That's that whole wall, I think. All the tops, the tops of this, right? Yep. I know

702
02:52:52,200 --> 02:53:19,319
that we have to be perfect with this. We'll get the ding. Shit. Madden, you saw this in real life?

703
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:42,540
Is somebody power washing a park? I don't think that's that abnormal. Anything else on this?

704
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:55,049
Yeah, here. What is this? I just made shrimp grits in your honor. I mean,

705
02:53:55,690 --> 02:53:58,649
hopefully it's good. I don't really like shrimp that much and I don't really like grits,

706
02:53:59,979 --> 02:54:16,889
but I hope it's good. I know a lot of people like it. Ungrateful, he made it for you. I'm not eating

707
02:54:16,889 --> 02:54:42,549
it. I have nothing to do with this. Ungrateful. All right, our strategy is working pretty well.

708
02:54:45,450 --> 02:55:02,260
Look at that. We're almost a tenth of the way there. I just said, I'm sure it's good. You could

709
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:10,280
be the most talented pizza crafter in the world. If somebody doesn't like pizza, they're not going

710
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:17,500
to really want to eat pizza. That doesn't mean that you don't have a very delicious dish in front of

711
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:49,020
you. You really might. I'm sure it's good. What's that term? Bad pizza is still good pizza? No,

712
02:55:49,020 --> 02:56:16,200
it isn't. No, it's not. Bad pizza is gross. Bad pizza is like sex. It's still sex, right?

713
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:20,200
Then they take the grease and they put droplets of grease in their eyes.

714
02:56:28,979 --> 02:56:32,579
I mean, how in the heck do you make a slope out of concrete? I don't know. You shape it.

715
02:56:45,030 --> 02:56:55,899
I actually eat junky pizza all the time. I actually love shitty pizza, so please

716
02:56:55,899 --> 02:57:05,620
do not take this joke as reality. Still though, sometimes you get a pizza that sucks so bad

717
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:36,409
and everyone's just like, well, who cares? It was still $18. Who pays $18 for pizza?

718
02:57:38,569 --> 02:58:03,180
A large pizzas are usually more than $15. I get a large pizza. I don't get a small. $18. Yeah,

719
02:58:03,180 --> 02:58:18,649
what do you mean $18? That's pretty normal. Did I cross the line? No. All right. Are we good here?

720
02:58:18,649 --> 02:58:34,250
Take a look at that. It's almost perfect. Chad, he's not eating it alone. I mean, I've seen

721
02:58:34,250 --> 02:58:42,299
people crush a large pizza before and I'm just like, holy shit. Dude, let's be real.

722
02:58:43,340 --> 02:58:49,420
I'm telling you right now, I have absolutely gotten really damn close to eating an entire

723
02:58:49,420 --> 02:58:55,959
large cheese pizza by myself and I could have done it, but there's two more slices left in the box

724
02:58:55,959 --> 02:59:03,399
and you look at it and you just kind of go, that would be bad. That already is bad, right? That's

725
02:59:03,399 --> 02:59:08,940
already bad. If there's two or three slices left in the box and you're the only one eating it,

726
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:21,159
it's let's box it up and put it in the fridge, right? Like somebody said he's talking about

727
02:59:21,159 --> 02:59:27,989
sex on a sponsor's treat. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. The sponsor was only for a little bit.

728
02:59:27,989 --> 02:59:31,989
I'm just still playing the game. I want to support the game. I think it's a great game.

729
02:59:34,780 --> 02:59:41,020
The sponsor segment has ended. We're just playing Power Wash Simulator because I think it's a great

730
02:59:41,020 --> 02:59:55,049
game, which by the way, where can you get it? I'd like to see it in the chat, please. Where's my...

731
02:59:55,049 --> 03:00:11,620
There it is. I didn't even talk. I made one small offhanded comment about people's opinions on pizza

732
03:00:11,620 --> 03:00:30,020
and did nothing. I didn't talk about whatever. All right. We are good. It's time to make a new

733
03:00:30,020 --> 03:00:46,629
line. You ready? Let's just do it. Let's make it easy to the bench. Like right here. Don't cross

734
03:00:46,629 --> 03:01:14,920
that line. Probably should just switch to the... I don't anymore. So we'll do first pass. You sound

735
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:51,799
like the radio guy from PT. Hello. Hello. Hello. All right. That's pass number one. I need the

736
03:01:51,799 --> 03:02:03,930
stronger nozzle here. I'll go over it again. That's the phone guy. You should have minus twoed that.

737
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:12,659
You had an opportunity. All of you that just weren't sure if you should have hit minus two,

738
03:02:12,659 --> 03:02:20,170
you should have. I'm telling you, you should have done that. And now it's too late because now you

739
03:02:20,170 --> 03:02:43,500
look like you're doing it because I said it. This is on there. Ooh, family from the town of

740
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:56,889
Rock. They're the modern Stone Age family. When you meet the Flintstones.

741
03:03:14,100 --> 03:03:51,780
I'm just kidding. This sound effect, the Super Nintendo wind sound effect that was in everything.

742
03:03:56,010 --> 03:04:03,239
This sound is so scary. It's such a strange thing. It always gives me some kind of... It makes me feel

743
03:04:03,239 --> 03:04:16,489
a certain way. This is an undertale. What's wrong with you? Seriously? Oh, yeah. I get that

744
03:04:16,489 --> 03:04:22,389
question a lot, but I don't even know what that... What do you mean? I'm just sitting here and just

745
03:04:22,389 --> 03:04:28,459
talking nonsense, just hanging out. Some of you guys act like I eat like bugs after the stream's

746
03:04:28,459 --> 03:04:37,750
over. I just kind of hang out. I do my thing. For some reason, I think a lot of you guys think I

747
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:41,989
do. Oh, yeah. Oh, here it is. My dinner. Oh, a whole plate of cockroaches. That doesn't happen.

748
03:04:41,989 --> 03:05:11,899
I'm just a regular guy. I'm just a normal person. Yeah. Hey, I get high and watch the same TV shows

749
03:05:11,899 --> 03:05:39,829
you do. Oh, dude, I think he eats bugs. No, I don't. In fact, I'm one of those people that...

750
03:05:39,829 --> 03:05:49,260
You know the... Oh, look. It's the bug in the popsicle novelty item. I would never eat that.

751
03:05:49,260 --> 03:05:55,030
I don't want that. I would never eat one of those. People always point to a tweet that I made in like

752
03:05:55,030 --> 03:06:01,270
2013 where I made a joke tweet about eating... I mean, I swallowed a bug and it was like, okay,

753
03:06:01,270 --> 03:06:05,190
that was weird. I should tweet about it. And I'm like, oh, it's the greatest thing I've ever tasted.

754
03:06:05,190 --> 03:06:10,149
What do I do about this? It was clearly a joke tweet from like 2012. I had people point to that

755
03:06:10,149 --> 03:06:31,670
and they're like, well, he's fucking crazy. But you know what I'm talking about? They're in the

756
03:06:31,670 --> 03:06:39,180
kind of golden, almost like amber. I wouldn't eat one of those. There's usually a worm in it

757
03:06:39,979 --> 03:06:57,209
or sometimes just some kind of other scary bug in it. No, no. Just give me the lollipop.

758
03:06:57,209 --> 03:07:06,440
Why do you have... Why does it have to be a bug inside of it? Right? That golden kind of amber

759
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:20,600
lollipop. Can I just have that? I don't want the bug inside of it because I feel like that

760
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:33,819
actually tastes good. Whatever that is. But I don't want the gross bug residue on it.

761
03:07:33,819 --> 03:07:53,129
Stop eating valuable rocks. Those are not lollipops. I find like these ancient stones

762
03:07:53,129 --> 03:08:01,579
in the ground. I don't understand why people eat these. I don't get it. No, dude, that's a million

763
03:08:01,579 --> 03:08:33,129
year old fossil. Don't put that in your mouth. It tastes really sweet. There we go. Did the bug

764
03:08:33,129 --> 03:09:00,379
taste good though? No, it was... You're the only person that makes me laugh out loud.

765
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:37,659
That's actually makes me happy. I'm dead serious. Gotta laugh sometimes, right? Will you eat bugs

766
03:09:37,659 --> 03:09:58,540
for the fans? No. No. I gotta get up on top of the railing. Would you eat a bug for the haters? No.

767
03:09:58,540 --> 03:10:05,319
I'm not eating any bugs. Then that's where that conversation ends. I'm not gonna eat bugs for the

768
03:10:05,319 --> 03:10:13,530
haters. Bugs for the fans. I'm not eating bugs. I wouldn't eat bugs if my... If like my mother asked

769
03:10:13,530 --> 03:10:35,319
me to. Talk about my biggest fan. Eat bugs for mom. I'm not eating... Nobody... I'm not... I wouldn't

770
03:10:35,319 --> 03:10:54,100
eat bugs for anybody. What about a doctor? I would feel like I was getting pranked. What do

771
03:10:54,100 --> 03:11:00,739
you mean? The doctor comes into the office and he's like, oh Jeremy, okay, you have a headache

772
03:11:01,459 --> 03:11:07,860
and it's time I can cure that for you. You have to eat four cockroaches in front of me while I hold

773
03:11:07,860 --> 03:11:16,069
up a fucking cell phone with TikTok open. What do you mean by that? Like, is there actual

774
03:11:16,069 --> 03:11:38,889
scientific evidence that this works? Okay, if it was true and there was a data, a trial or a study,

775
03:11:38,889 --> 03:11:42,569
and it was passed, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever, FDA, whatever, it doesn't matter.

776
03:11:43,209 --> 03:11:46,809
If this actually worked and it was for a thing that I wanted to get like cured, get rid of or

777
03:11:46,809 --> 03:11:52,360
something. Dude, you know, that like chest and back problem I've had for like four years,

778
03:11:53,940 --> 03:11:59,620
if the doctor came in and was like, Jeremy, uh, you know, that kind of like center chest like pain

779
03:11:59,620 --> 03:12:03,540
that's really kind of fucking up your life last four years. Uh, if you eat this whole

780
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:11,829
bowl of cockroaches, it'll go away. And he said, here's the study. That bowl will be gone in 15

781
03:12:11,829 --> 03:12:28,059
seconds. So I guess, I guess there is, I guess there is a place where I would do it. But no,

782
03:12:28,059 --> 03:12:38,040
if he just kind of came in and was like, oh, hey, I'm a doctor. Eat bugs. He just opens the door.

783
03:12:38,040 --> 03:12:44,809
Hey, I'm a doctor. Eat these bugs and puts them down and closes the door. I'm not going to do that.

784
03:12:50,250 --> 03:12:56,680
I don't, I wouldn't do that. What if he ate them in front of you first? I don't care. That's all,

785
03:12:56,680 --> 03:12:59,959
that's the, that's the, whatever weird shit he's doing. I have nothing to do with that.

786
03:13:02,809 --> 03:13:06,569
So he comes in the room and he's just like, okay, so we took a look at your blood work

787
03:13:07,370 --> 03:13:13,350
and he's just, he's just eating them out of his pocket. Yeah. Your, uh, your, your, uh, HDL

788
03:13:13,350 --> 03:13:19,670
cholesterol is a little high. Uh, your LDL is okay, but you know, and then he goes like this

789
03:13:19,670 --> 03:13:26,870
after talking about my blood results. I don't know. What does the doctor look like?

790
03:13:29,159 --> 03:13:40,010
Is he like six feet tall, like 200, lean cut? Is it how, what does he look like? Does he have

791
03:13:40,969 --> 03:13:58,389
completely blemish free skin? Does he have flowing hair? And it comes up with his license

792
03:13:58,389 --> 03:14:05,190
and he's like, look, 60, 60. And it's, and he looks fucking amazing. I don't know. Maybe

793
03:14:05,190 --> 03:14:23,959
I'd have to think about it. All right, that's done. All right. Plan worked. Dude, why do you

794
03:14:23,959 --> 03:14:31,399
only listen to handsome doctors? No, I didn't say handsome. When did I say handsome? I said he was

795
03:14:31,399 --> 03:14:39,829
like cut up, jacked, healthy, blemish free, flowing hair. He's looks like he's, he's me and

796
03:14:39,829 --> 03:14:45,270
he moves in a full stride. You know what I mean? I never said, wow, look at how handsome this doctor

797
03:14:45,270 --> 03:15:50,229
is. How healthy does he look? Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious. Okay. So fine. Sorry.

798
03:15:50,790 --> 03:16:02,059
So this wicked handsome doctor walks in. Okay. Now, what do you want me to say? Who gives a shit?

799
03:16:04,120 --> 03:16:12,280
He looks healthy. He's, he's, he's clean. He's clean shaven. He's, he's going like this,

800
03:16:16,760 --> 03:16:23,290
like that. And he's postures like this. And he's got the clipboard up here.

801
03:16:26,229 --> 03:16:43,459
He's got big hair and he's so fit. He just got done cycling and he's got cycling shorts on

802
03:16:43,459 --> 03:17:07,239
and a lab coat. Stop sharing your fantasy. So, so my fantasy is this wicked handsome doctor

803
03:17:07,239 --> 03:17:14,920
in bike shorts comes in and we eat bugs together and have a romantic relationship of some kind.

804
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:44,409
This is what you think my fantasy of mine is. Sounds about right.

805
03:17:50,940 --> 03:17:55,739
Hold on. You're missing an incredibly important detail. He rides his bike down the hall

806
03:17:55,739 --> 03:18:01,850
of the doctor's office. You know, the door is open. I can see out into the hallway and he's,

807
03:18:01,850 --> 03:18:07,610
he just slowly pulls up on his bike. It's a huge mountain bike and he gets off and kickstand goes

808
03:18:07,610 --> 03:18:15,260
up and then he comes in. Right. That's perfect. And he's still got, he's got, he's got the helmet

809
03:18:15,260 --> 03:18:41,780
on. It's a big manly bike. He takes the bike helmet off and his hair is flowing.

810
03:18:54,809 --> 03:19:03,239
All right. This looks good. I need a new line, a real man sized bike. All right. New line is

811
03:19:03,239 --> 03:19:42,739
right here. Don't cross that. Hey, you want, you want to eat some bugs, man? Would you eat the bugs

812
03:19:42,739 --> 03:19:50,520
in Jerma's fantasy scenario? I doubt it. I doubt, uh, yeah, no way. It's going to be mostly nos.

813
03:19:55,319 --> 03:20:10,379
Don't, this is not, don't call it my fantasy scenario. This fucking music.

814
03:20:25,579 --> 03:20:37,110
What is playing right now? Why is this playing? Why are we getting this fucking romance music?

815
03:20:50,420 --> 03:20:58,069
Just got, just got done with a quick bike ride. Kickstand comes in. Just like sweat,

816
03:20:58,069 --> 03:21:07,290
just glistening off his forehead. So what brings you in today? Well, I have a little

817
03:21:07,290 --> 03:21:13,459
bit of a headache. Uh, it's kind of like a migraine as kind of deal I got going on here.

818
03:21:14,020 --> 03:21:19,430
One second takes the bike helmet off and just hair. It's a fucking, it's, it's like at least

819
03:21:19,430 --> 03:21:33,850
16 to 20 inches here. It pulls up the license 60 by the way. And I'm like, Oh wow. Look at that

820
03:21:33,850 --> 03:21:38,500
crazy thing. That's why you got that. What a head of hair. Yeah. I haven't had a headache,

821
03:21:38,500 --> 03:22:03,610
by the way, in a long time, different music. You want to eat some bugs. The music changed

822
03:22:03,610 --> 03:22:18,329
and changed everything. This is bug music now. Why is this music perfect for all this going on?

823
03:22:18,969 --> 03:22:38,280
What the fuck is happening? Why this is forget it, forget it. What even sound this auto played

824
03:22:39,819 --> 03:22:44,540
water world for super Nintendo. Just started auto playing after Flintstones.

825
03:22:44,540 --> 03:22:54,620
I went five and a half minutes into this. Stop. No, stop it. I'm getting on cam. I'm getting,

826
03:22:54,620 --> 03:23:38,139
I'm getting out of here. I'm gone. Put on block. I'm back. This music. All right. What's this one?

827
03:23:41,500 --> 03:24:00,219
What's solstice title screen theme? What the hell? I did not expect that.

828
03:24:29,750 --> 03:24:42,729
Oh shit. This is good. Who put this in there? Who put this in the chat? This is VR Josh. This is

829
03:24:42,729 --> 03:25:12,299
lightning good. Dude, this is lightning good. This is called solstice music.

830
03:25:14,299 --> 03:25:29,909
Title screen theme by Tim Fallon. Holy shit. This is crazy. Tim Fallon also did pluck.

831
03:25:30,790 --> 03:25:41,290
Oh, all right. That makes sense. Was that new line? Yeah. Here. Okay.

832
03:25:42,620 --> 03:26:00,700
Silver surfer. Shit. All right. That's awesome. The game was absolute blast. No, the game was ass.

833
03:26:01,420 --> 03:26:05,979
Let me read that correct. The game was absolute ass, but the music slapped. Okay.

834
03:26:07,100 --> 03:26:52,090
That was insane. Oh, somebody can somebody take ad out of the title

835
03:26:52,090 --> 03:26:54,969
because we're technically not. This is not an ad anymore.

836
03:27:12,459 --> 03:27:45,059
Let me hear a service. I can't even say that word. Damn. You know, it's wild to think about

837
03:27:45,059 --> 03:27:54,329
this kind of stuff with the tools that are available now. I wonder what some of these

838
03:27:54,329 --> 03:27:58,729
guys could have come up with, right? Some of them are still in the industry, right?

839
03:28:02,649 --> 03:28:05,770
But this is what they had to work with back then and listen to this.

840
03:28:14,739 --> 03:28:19,139
People still do it. Oh yeah. But I'm just talking about back a long time ago when this is you

841
03:28:19,139 --> 03:28:25,030
couldn't do anything else with this. I wonder if whatever tools they had, if you gave them even

842
03:28:25,030 --> 03:28:43,780
more tools, normal music existed. But I'm talking about the, you got me. You got me

843
03:28:43,780 --> 03:29:00,329
because that was dumb. I look, I worded that wrong though. Like if they could have done this

844
03:29:00,329 --> 03:29:04,090
with an actual orchestra or, and it could have gone on a CD or something, right?

845
03:29:07,530 --> 03:29:18,840
If they had the tools now back then to put it onto the cartridge orchestras existed. I'm not,

846
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:28,340
I'm saying, look, I'm saying that if they could put more data on a disc, what would they have done

847
03:29:28,340 --> 03:29:44,420
with the data? What would Silver Surfer theme song have sounded like? Would he have changed anything?

848
03:29:45,059 --> 03:30:20,469
Just do a tie on bug juices. He did the music for echo the dolphin. That was sick. What did

849
03:30:20,469 --> 03:30:47,879
let's do another echo the dolphin. Did he do echo the dolphin? Oh, that's all Tim fallen. Okay.

850
03:30:48,520 --> 03:31:18,709
The playlist from earlier. I held the Wilma way longer than that. So this is the whole playlist.

851
03:31:18,709 --> 03:31:28,459
What is, what is this? Oh, that's not it. Okay. So what's in, what's the next in playlist?

852
03:31:28,459 --> 03:31:46,059
This is the whole Tim fallen playlist. Let's go. All right. That's good. That's a good volume.

853
03:31:51,030 --> 03:31:57,879
All right. Let's go put on block. I've listened to block a lot of times.

854
03:32:07,659 --> 03:32:10,219
Did this guy do the original NES Ninja Turtles?

855
03:32:10,700 --> 03:32:21,899
No. Okay. Kind of sounds similar. Like it could be similar. Somebody said, yes, you're the only

856
03:32:21,899 --> 03:32:30,040
person that said yes. Why? So if you're wondering how much content is in this game, I've played

857
03:32:30,040 --> 03:32:55,979
this two different times now. Galaga. I played it for like six or seven, five or six hours before

858
03:32:55,979 --> 03:32:59,579
about three, four hours. Now there's at least, there's a lot of content in the game.

859
03:33:00,700 --> 03:33:08,309
There's a lot of just to do, just to chill in flight. You already know that. But what is

860
03:33:08,309 --> 03:33:18,100
you don't know is that it could be on the Xbox one Xbox. Wait, is that might be wrong?

861
03:33:18,100 --> 03:33:22,809
But it's all right. The ads gone now. I'm not doing an ad anymore. So it could be on that.

862
03:33:41,620 --> 03:34:05,190
Can I get this with the, this one here? Yeah. The command is still there. That's okay.

863
03:34:05,190 --> 03:34:23,209
They probably just shouldn't be in the title anymore. Do the boss theme for, for flock.

864
03:34:23,209 --> 03:34:34,760
I'll put flock on after this. Oh, that is still there. Hold on. I'm gonna go harder.

865
03:34:35,319 --> 03:35:38,700
I'm at 37% right now. Is it better with the sound off? You want the sound on? I feel like

866
03:35:38,700 --> 03:35:52,440
it's just kind of in the background. Keep the sound on, sound off or sound on.

867
03:35:55,819 --> 03:36:07,219
RT game, RT game of the raid. What's up, RT? RT, you did this in real life. How was that experience?

868
03:36:07,219 --> 03:36:19,700
Yeah. Thanks for the raid. Welcome. Playing power washer simulator. If you guys don't know,

869
03:36:19,700 --> 03:36:26,020
RT did this in real life. He did a power washer stream where he power washed shit in real life.

870
03:36:26,659 --> 03:36:43,510
Hope you had a good stream. Welcome everybody. Always a pleasure to see, uh, RT. You're just

871
03:36:43,510 --> 03:36:49,450
doing work in a video game. Yeah. But then we'll listen to the fucking chip tunes while we're at

872
03:36:49,450 --> 03:37:00,180
it. You can do that as well. Do I have to, do I have to explain myself? The most time I have on

873
03:37:00,180 --> 03:37:04,819
stream in a video game is a game where you clean houses. Um, so I don't know. I just, I like these

874
03:37:04,819 --> 03:37:20,600
games. I like this kind of stuff. I don't know. I just do. I heard this one already, but whatever.

875
03:37:20,600 --> 03:37:45,770
What do you want to do? Don't explain yourself. You're going to make it worse. All right. I'm

876
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:51,909
up. This isn't, this is looking good. This is actually looking pretty good. No, there's no

877
03:37:51,909 --> 03:37:56,069
raid song. Guys, we don't do raid songs. I, all right. I, it's time to put my foot down.

878
03:37:57,190 --> 03:38:06,280
The raid song has not been a funny joke since 2018. I cease this. Cease this immediately.

879
03:38:09,510 --> 03:38:41,850
Cease this immediately. Oh, yuck. What the hell? Can I not stand up there? Can I not walk up here?

880
03:38:44,010 --> 03:39:07,059
Sorry. Maybe I can get the ding from here. It's going to be close. So many shit stains.

881
03:39:08,120 --> 03:39:27,930
That'd be weird if that was at a skate park. I got to help. Heck of a filthy sidecar. If you can

882
03:39:27,930 --> 03:39:31,690
fit us in, I can run it up to you if that helps. Wait, you'll deliver it here and I'll do it.

883
03:39:32,409 --> 03:39:38,579
There's one thing I know about concrete is that it likes to be as flat as possible. What's going on?

884
03:39:39,219 --> 03:40:09,500
Why is that blinking over there? Because that's the quest. I don't have to do that immediately,

885
03:40:09,500 --> 03:40:52,149
right? I can do it whenever I want. Now, now, hurry. All right. Sorry, one guy. I'm doing it later.

886
03:41:22,500 --> 03:41:40,219
All right. These rails. Good. Oh, the gate too. This like fence here. You know what sound that

887
03:41:40,219 --> 03:41:49,500
makes too. It's like I love that sound. That's like one of my favorite sounds is a power washer

888
03:41:49,500 --> 03:43:01,989
kind of hitting a grate like this. Yep. This is like a 10 hour version of this song. This is looped

889
03:43:01,989 --> 03:43:21,559
four times. Has it? Oh, it's almost over. Oh, it's from the ladder. What's next? I don't even

890
03:43:21,559 --> 03:43:43,479
know. I don't know what this is, but it sounds good. Does this work? Oh, I can. That's not that

891
03:43:43,479 --> 03:44:04,819
high though. It shouldn't be the few more steps. You're going to fail the quest. I'm fine. Section

892
03:44:04,819 --> 03:44:44,389
is almost done. Beautiful. Beautiful. I'm not even halfway. Holy shit. All right. I'll be good.

893
03:44:50,540 --> 03:44:56,139
Wait, what? No, I'm not there yet. I thought somebody said I hit a million followers.

894
03:44:56,139 --> 03:45:12,100
I was like, oh, wow. Almost there. Yeah, almost. I'm going to take a screenshot. Just play among

895
03:45:12,100 --> 03:45:18,729
us for 10 minutes and you'll do it. Now I want it to be natural. I want it to be natural. I don't

896
03:45:18,729 --> 03:45:52,739
want to just have it be like a, let's go. I'm supposed to get up there. That's that unfollowed.

897
03:45:52,739 --> 03:46:00,780
Don't do that. Okay. Did I complete everything over here? All right. We're going to take a break

898
03:46:00,780 --> 03:46:16,870
from that. Let's go to, uh, we'll put on flock. Wait, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Really? I remember

899
03:46:16,870 --> 03:46:38,899
this. I didn't. Wow. This guy did everything. Yep. All right. So now I can make a new line. New line

900
03:46:38,899 --> 03:46:50,170
is here. Let's say from here to here from this, like right here, let's just go to the edge of

901
03:46:50,170 --> 03:47:03,079
here. Yeah. All right. That's good. New line. Oh, you know, let's make it easy there. All right.

902
03:47:03,079 --> 03:47:28,579
New line. Let's go. You can still kind of hear this. What's next? Is this the same song? Guys,

903
03:47:29,559 --> 03:47:52,040
I got a better idea. I want to play the maximum carnage. OST. This is a good one.

904
03:47:52,680 --> 03:48:06,899
All right. You got to guess my favorite song on this album. Put it louder. All right. You got

905
03:48:06,899 --> 03:48:30,469
to guess my favorite song on the album. It's not this one. I'll let you know when it comes on.

906
03:48:31,110 --> 03:49:36,020
That is the title theme, right? I believe it is maximum carnage. I feel like weird right now.

907
03:49:36,020 --> 03:49:40,889
I'm just sitting here going like, yeah, while I'm power washing a wall, listen to maximum carnage.

908
03:49:46,629 --> 03:49:59,180
Yep. This one's good. Do you guys know that venom is a good guy in this game?

909
03:49:59,899 --> 03:50:03,979
Did you know that venom is a good character and he's a good guy and he's an antihero?

910
03:50:05,909 --> 03:50:29,850
Don't ever say the venom is a bad guy. He's not a bad guy. He's an antihero. It's good.

911
03:50:29,850 --> 03:50:50,569
Morbius is that now. No more. Nevermind. Where's my stool? And no, this one's good too, but it's not

912
03:50:50,569 --> 03:51:30,200
my favorite one. This one's actually pretty banging. Yep. Mod chat's got it. Dr. Clay's got it.

913
03:51:30,200 --> 03:51:45,979
No spoilers, no leaking. Morbius is in this game? Wait, Morbius is in the game as what?

914
03:51:45,979 --> 03:51:58,840
Is he one of the summons? I don't mean like who does the actor Morbius play as. I'm saying what

915
03:51:58,840 --> 03:52:14,760
does he do? Is he a boss or is he one of the summons? Because there's five or six summons.

916
03:52:14,760 --> 03:52:21,420
Can't you summon Captain America in that game? In maximum carnage? Yeah. No, you can summon

917
03:52:21,420 --> 03:52:29,139
Captain America. He comes out and throws a shield at somebody. So he's a summon. Yeah, he is a

918
03:52:29,139 --> 03:52:44,489
summon. All right. Who is he in the game? That's so stupid. Yeah, who does the actor Morbius play

919
03:52:44,489 --> 03:52:54,700
in maximum carnage for the Super Nintendo? Not this one. Where's that line? Wait, hold on.

920
03:53:02,579 --> 03:53:06,500
Some of you will get that. Some of you will. Some of you will. I will just unlock a fucking

921
03:53:06,500 --> 03:53:16,899
memory and you'll be like, holy shit, you unlocked an entire memory. I'm glad I just

922
03:53:16,899 --> 03:53:30,659
unlocked that memory for you. That's when you first hear this song and you first hear that noise.

923
03:53:31,379 --> 03:54:04,250
You just woke up sleeper agents. Like I never played video games before. By the way, I want

924
03:54:04,250 --> 03:54:07,770
to make sure you turn your volume down a little. When my favorite song comes on, it's going at

925
03:54:07,770 --> 03:54:23,770
maximum as high as the volume can go on my OBS. That's not true. I won't do that to you. All right,

926
03:54:23,770 --> 03:54:32,309
right to this lump here. This kind of sounds like the thing that Beavis and Butthead do.

927
03:54:36,219 --> 03:55:25,659
They put their hands up. This is like a midi version of that. Oh, wow. Right here is

928
03:55:27,180 --> 03:55:31,979
like carnage always hit me with the axe arm and it always just pissed me off right there,

929
03:55:31,979 --> 03:56:13,260
right when the music stopped. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time that I turn this

930
03:56:13,260 --> 03:56:28,360
shit way the fuck up. It's getting there. We're getting close. One more Beavis and Butthead

931
03:56:30,219 --> 03:56:58,379
and then after that, I think it's time to turn it up. Here it comes. It's definitely right here.

932
03:56:58,379 --> 03:57:28,299
Turn it up. You guys don't know this is a, this is literally just the mob rules. Black Sabbath

933
03:57:28,299 --> 03:58:16,920
song. Oh, the line. Oops. Sorry. All right. So hold on. Right. Right. I know DMCA, but still.

934
03:58:16,920 --> 03:58:28,540
So you hear that, right? You hear that one. Let's put a DMCA, whatever. That's an ad.

935
03:58:28,540 --> 03:59:27,190
All right. You ready? So hear that. So now it's literally the same exact song.

936
03:59:35,479 --> 03:59:47,750
It's the exact same song. Hey, this one's DMCA safe. Spider-Man wrote this one. This one,

937
03:59:47,750 --> 03:59:51,350
Black Sabbath had nothing to do with this. Spider-Man wrote and directed this song.

938
04:00:03,639 --> 04:00:31,659
No, it was Morbius. I'm sorry. You're right. Watch that line. Don't go across it. I wish I

939
04:00:31,659 --> 04:01:05,670
had more soap. An uncredited version of Black Sabbath. The mob rules appears in the soundtrack

940
04:01:05,670 --> 04:01:26,280
during the boss battles against the supervillain. It was literally just ripped. That's so funny.

941
04:01:26,280 --> 04:01:31,450
Back to our regularly scheduled water noises for a little bit. I'll put Plok on in a minute.

942
04:01:31,450 --> 04:01:35,049
We've got to take a break from the, you know, that those sounds to these sounds.

943
04:01:35,610 --> 04:01:52,500
I'll make a little rip bozo. What? Look at this place. I'm, I'm, I'm 55% of the way there.

944
04:01:52,500 --> 04:02:08,969
I'm pretty much done. What's and I know there's still some, but this should blink eventually.

945
04:02:17,930 --> 04:02:27,290
This streamer is like a goofy, that person left and then not coming back ever.

946
04:02:27,930 --> 04:02:39,770
And I probably always remember that time when it was like, Hey, you should check out this guy,

947
04:02:39,770 --> 04:02:46,389
Jerma. He's funny. I like him. And he's like, I'm yeah. I mean, I went to his stream and I'm not,

948
04:02:46,389 --> 04:02:53,909
I'm not a fan. This guy's so crazy. He's like such a w wow. That was so weird. What he did.

949
04:02:55,030 --> 04:03:20,180
He did like a goofy laugh to this guy. Did you hear this guy eats bugs? Jerma was funny today.

950
04:03:20,180 --> 04:03:45,100
Sad. That's not fair. All right. Should I do the work order thing? No, I need a new line.

951
04:03:48,219 --> 04:03:57,530
How is this only 57%? Here's the line right here. So from like here,

952
04:03:58,489 --> 04:04:12,360
that's good. Um, yeah, whatever. That's fine. Let's get right in the middle here. There we go.

953
04:04:13,159 --> 04:04:39,579
First pass. Why will we not play tally hall? What's tally hall tally hall? What, what is it?

954
04:04:41,100 --> 04:04:51,479
Why people saying play tell? What's the, it's a band. Okay. It's a great band. It's just,

955
04:04:52,120 --> 04:05:15,829
but why, why would I, it's just DMCA that they're good. They're good. But yeah,

956
04:05:16,790 --> 04:05:25,079
I mean, I, I mean, I might put some DMCA shit up here, but I am playing a whole album on stream.

957
04:05:25,719 --> 04:05:46,940
He isn't going to get me in trouble. All right. Let's clean this up a little bit more. Where's

958
04:05:46,940 --> 04:06:03,899
the line? Right there. Right. What is this? Oh, I didn't even go up there. All right. So

959
04:06:04,540 --> 04:06:10,809
I have a funny story about them. Think of water and soap. So my mother visited here at one time.

960
04:06:11,370 --> 04:06:16,100
This is, I don't know, let's say it was, I don't remember exactly, but it was like last year at

961
04:06:16,100 --> 04:06:26,299
some point. And my mother watches the channel sometimes. So she came over and she, you know,

962
04:06:26,299 --> 04:06:31,420
was making references to the streams and Hey, yeah. So, you know, like look at me and stuff.

963
04:06:31,420 --> 04:06:36,780
And I'm like, Oh my God, you watch, you actually watch the streams. So she started, she started to

964
04:06:36,780 --> 04:06:44,549
like understand Twitch lingo and started to use it Andy. And the reason why I'm saying this is

965
04:06:44,549 --> 04:06:54,180
because Holly was, was washing her hands, like very, very lightly, right? So she's washing her

966
04:06:54,180 --> 04:07:06,120
hands. And my mother comes over to her and goes, Oh, wow. Soap Andy. Then she had never said

967
04:07:06,120 --> 04:07:14,280
anything Andy before this. She called Holly soap Andy because Holly used like two pumps of soap.

968
04:07:24,120 --> 04:07:42,219
And we just started cracking up. We were like, Holy shit. Oh no, we have converted her.

969
04:07:46,620 --> 04:07:56,420
Soap Andy. It was like, honest to God, it was probably one of the cutest,

970
04:07:57,059 --> 04:08:05,540
just most adorable things I've ever heard. It was just so funny. Like she had just learned the lingo.

971
04:08:05,540 --> 04:08:09,940
She's like, I got it. I got an opportunity to use it. I saw two or three pumps of soap there.

972
04:08:11,399 --> 04:08:36,139
Soap Andy. Has she been among us the whole time? I don't kind of. So sometimes I will stream

973
04:08:36,780 --> 04:08:40,780
and my mother will make a reference to the stream that I did a day or two ago.

974
04:08:41,500 --> 04:08:45,579
And I'm just sitting there going, there's no way she would know that unless she watched the whole

975
04:08:45,579 --> 04:08:54,309
thing. But then other times, I think she just kind of pops in randomly. I think like once every like

976
04:08:54,309 --> 04:09:00,040
few months, she will watch a stream, but I will have conversations and she will say,

977
04:09:00,920 --> 04:09:04,969
you know, she'll say something like, there's no way you didn't watch a lot of the stream, right?

978
04:09:04,969 --> 04:09:09,670
So for instance, like today, if my mother would have, would have get on the phone with me and be

979
04:09:09,670 --> 04:09:14,149
like, oh yeah, so Jeremy, I found this new product. It's called the the water grenades.

980
04:09:14,149 --> 04:09:46,120
I feel like you watched a lot of the stream today. Like you had to. For the love of God,

981
04:09:46,120 --> 04:09:50,120
tell her to watch without chat. I don't think she even knows how to use chat.

982
04:09:53,989 --> 04:10:44,059
She just like puts on the video player. There's still gunk on here. What? What did she think of

983
04:10:44,059 --> 04:10:55,209
dollhouse? She liked it. If you don't understand the Twitch extension stuff, it's hard to follow

984
04:10:55,209 --> 04:11:00,329
a lot of that sometimes. So but no, she she gets it. She understood. She knew what was going on.

985
04:11:01,049 --> 04:11:40,979
Did you see you have whoopee with death? I assume I'm assuming. Yes, we don't talk about that

986
04:11:40,979 --> 04:11:46,059
very often. And I'm realizing that my mother does watch stream sometimes. So she just heard

987
04:11:46,940 --> 04:11:51,340
potentially a long conversation about me going to the doctor and eating bugs in a romantic

988
04:11:51,420 --> 04:12:12,729
relationship with the guy. So she's a hate watcher. She just hates everything I'm doing.

989
04:12:18,440 --> 04:12:27,000
That'd be so funny. Really, really bad stream today. Really not happy with what you were saying.

990
04:12:28,340 --> 04:12:34,170
But that wasn't it wasn't funny. You know, I minus two the most I've ever minus two being your chat.

991
04:12:34,809 --> 04:12:54,149
I didn't raise you like that. I raised you to be plus twos, Jeremy. Holly said she I missed the

992
04:12:54,149 --> 04:13:33,139
romantic doctor bit. What is that? Babe, babe, delete the VOD. No, it's chat was acting crazy.

993
04:13:33,940 --> 04:14:37,819
Like usual. She's being informed. She's laughing over here. Yeah, I okay. Yeah, I ate. I I chat said

994
04:14:37,819 --> 04:14:46,100
I ate bugs with a guy. That's it. Yeah, I don't know why I'm like, oh, don't worry. No, no,

995
04:14:46,100 --> 04:14:50,020
I literally ate bugs with the doctor. And that's it. That's it. That's literally it.

996
04:14:52,180 --> 04:15:12,149
Somebody just wrote it was hot. Oh, please. Honey, honey, honey, honey, they fucked up. Okay.

997
04:15:12,870 --> 04:15:38,420
Do you see you read that? Did you see that? This is unfair. You came up with the meat of the story.

998
04:15:38,420 --> 04:15:44,579
She said, Why did the doctor have sexy biker shorts on? Hold on. Hold on a minute. Hold on

999
04:15:44,579 --> 04:15:52,579
just a second. Never in that story. Never in that story. Did I say sexy biker shorts? Not one time.

1000
04:15:53,139 --> 04:15:59,159
I pull back the VOD. I want all of you to pull the VOD back. And not once did I say sexy biker

1001
04:15:59,159 --> 04:16:08,059
shorts. I did not say I said I said biker shorts. He was in biker shorts, not sexy biker shorts.

1002
04:16:08,059 --> 04:16:16,260
I want to know where that's from. Because it's not from me. It was verbatim.

1003
04:16:17,219 --> 04:17:15,110
All biker shorts are sexy. Okay. No, he was biking. She said, Okay, honey. Okay. See, there we go.

1004
04:17:15,110 --> 04:17:28,860
Honey, we're good. We're good. Stop saying sexy biker shorts. He said he was a 60 year old hot

1005
04:17:28,860 --> 04:17:46,219
biker guy. Skin is falling off my mouth. This is no this is not a sponsored stream anymore.

1006
04:17:46,780 --> 04:17:58,280
I genuinely think this is a fun game. This is not a sponsored segment anymore. The sponsor segment

1007
04:17:58,280 --> 04:18:07,479
is well done with that. This is just a very fun game, which Oh, man, I just wish I knew where I

1008
04:18:07,479 --> 04:18:12,979
could get it. Well, I can tell you. On the Xbox Game Pass store. You can get it. It's available

1009
04:18:12,979 --> 04:18:20,069
right now for Steam. It's on Steam right now. Just came into 1.0. Just came into 1.0 on Steam.

1010
04:18:21,299 --> 04:18:51,399
I forgot my line. Stop activating sleeper agents. It's got six co-op players. I feel like that's

1011
04:18:51,399 --> 04:19:29,370
gonna be insane. Why is everybody president sleeper? That's just your mom in chat. God damn.

1012
04:19:29,370 --> 04:19:40,469
That was a good one. That was seriously holy. Wow. That was a good one. But what a good callback.

1013
04:19:40,469 --> 04:20:10,200
That's a great callback. That was an absolute zinger. I can't believe I actually did the skate

1014
04:20:10,280 --> 04:21:08,170
park. That's shocking to me. Isn't it shocking to you? Got it. German sexy doctor sitting in a

1015
04:21:08,170 --> 04:21:52,149
skate park. E-A-T-I-N-G bugs. I found that one adequately humorous. Me too. Why did you read

1016
04:21:52,149 --> 04:21:59,540
that? Because it was funny. Are you questioning me reading messages in chat? I read a chat message

1017
04:21:59,540 --> 04:22:07,610
that said I said I was going to shove a baseball up my ass. There's no I'm you know, then that's

1018
04:22:07,610 --> 04:22:12,250
gonna get you banned, right? But I'm doesn't mean I'm not gonna read it and be shocked by it.

1019
04:22:20,889 --> 04:22:28,459
I keep that lives rent free in my head. You have no idea. You guys have no idea. I've said it

1020
04:22:28,459 --> 04:22:33,500
yesterday. It's rent free. Every day I think about somebody just typing out. Oh, no. Yeah,

1021
04:22:33,500 --> 04:22:36,620
dude. Let me help you out here. Are you really a new viewer? Yeah, let me help you. He's gonna

1022
04:22:36,620 --> 04:22:41,670
shove a whole baseball up his ass. That's the baseball stream. There's so much. There's so many

1023
04:22:41,670 --> 04:22:48,500
layers to why that's funny. So many. It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard probably in

1024
04:22:48,500 --> 04:22:56,659
chat because there's so much of the going on there. This is big stream event. I keep hyping it up,

1025
04:22:56,659 --> 04:23:01,299
man. Oh, the baseball stream, man. Be ready. It's gonna be me putting a baseball in my ass.

1026
04:23:01,940 --> 04:23:08,360
And I'm hyping it up for months and months and months and months in a like in a baseball field

1027
04:23:13,270 --> 04:23:19,670
or even not. Am I just here? That's what makes me laugh so much is I'm the baseball stream. Oh,

1028
04:23:19,670 --> 04:23:28,170
he's gonna play baseball. No, it's me in this chair putting a baseball in my ass. You understand

1029
04:23:28,170 --> 04:23:38,870
how much is going on here? And why? Why would I hype that up so much? Why would I ever? But just

1030
04:23:38,870 --> 04:23:45,239
so nonchalantly just replying to somebody with a very basic question. Dude, baseball stream.

1031
04:23:45,239 --> 04:23:53,510
I wonder what that is. A new viewer. Oh, replying to that person. Just as being a mother fucker.

1032
04:23:54,389 --> 04:24:04,379
Dude, he's gonna shove and it was it's not just baseball. It's whole baseball.

1033
04:24:05,659 --> 04:24:10,569
It's whole baseball. He's gonna shove a whole baseball up his ass.

1034
04:24:12,889 --> 04:24:29,399
It's like, God damn it. So much goes into that what I hear and see in my head. Hey, guys. Hey,

1035
04:24:29,399 --> 04:24:34,760
bro. Yeah, welcome to the baseball stream. It's time. Get hype. It's the baseball stream. I've

1036
04:24:34,760 --> 04:24:40,040
been talking about this for a long time. You know the stream where I shove a baseball up my ass.

1037
04:24:40,040 --> 04:24:52,200
It's like, what the fuck? Why would I get it? It's read free forever. I'll never get rid of it.

1038
04:24:52,200 --> 04:25:03,420
It's always going to be there because it's implied that I've been talking about it for months and

1039
04:25:03,420 --> 04:25:16,709
everyone's like super excited about that. This is so funny. It's so funny. Maybe. Whoa, cool.

1040
04:25:18,420 --> 04:25:24,870
Maybe I am a childish and immature moron, but I'm sorry that's funny.

1041
04:25:26,389 --> 04:25:53,319
That's very fucking funny. You know, and that person's banned from the channel, right?

1042
04:25:55,000 --> 04:25:58,520
Mods like please refresh my memory. That person has been permanently banned from this from

1043
04:25:58,520 --> 04:26:03,879
German 985, right? They are permanently banned. They're never they're not allowed here ever again.

1044
04:26:03,879 --> 04:26:13,459
Or the way they weren't. Oh, they're all saying I don't know. Look up and see if they have

1045
04:26:13,459 --> 04:26:44,219
permaban. What do they get? A week? There are 30 days? Wait a minute. Hold on. This person has

1046
04:26:44,219 --> 04:26:48,860
been unbanned and they asked if I was going to play World of Warcraft the other day.

1047
04:26:59,770 --> 04:27:33,690

04:28:23,049 --> 04:28:30,979
What do you mean? Why are you saying that? Because of the ball? The baseball? What is that?

1051
04:28:35,579 --> 04:28:44,790
Okay. Hey, by the way, I was a huge World of Warcraft fan, buddy. So let's relax for a sec.

1052
04:29:03,020 --> 04:29:06,620
No, you're making it live rent free in my brain again. I'm seeing the original messages.

1053
04:29:11,909 --> 04:29:20,360
Dude, what the fuck? This guy should be banned like permanently. Okay, how many times have they said

1054
04:29:20,360 --> 04:29:27,610
this? How many times have they said this? Wait a minute. How many times have they said this?

1055
04:29:29,530 --> 04:29:35,540
This is the hold on the rabbit hole just got deeper. This is fucking unbelievable. Hold on.

1056
04:29:35,540 --> 04:29:42,600
Give me one second. So here this this is the original comment that lives rent free in my

1057
04:29:42,600 --> 04:29:49,700
brain forever. It's the funniest fucking comment I've ever heard. So let's get this let's get this

1058
04:29:49,700 --> 04:29:54,120
done right. Because this this is a saga apparently that I did not know existed.

1059
04:30:13,559 --> 04:30:19,319
I don't think I can show this on stream. I don't know I could I can't show that on stream. That's

1060
04:30:19,319 --> 04:30:36,840
gonna get me in trouble. Not dodge is this guy. Okay, this is the this is the original message.

1061
04:30:42,760 --> 04:30:52,200
But it gets back. This this just kept going. I didn't know this kept going. I can't show the

1132
04:53:03,450 --> 04:53:16,819
I miss besides this wall right here this is the only wall right I think this is it and maybe the

1133
04:53:16,819 --> 04:54:09,139
tops well just hit me something just smashed into me threw me forward I didn't do anything

1134
04:54:09,139 --> 04:54:26,139
97 I'm gonna it's gonna be such a pain in the ass to find where this is you might enjoy death

1135
04:54:26,139 --> 04:54:33,189
stranding no I don't think so here's why so somebody said dude you like these kind of tasks

1136
04:54:34,490 --> 04:54:39,849
you're a big fan of just kind of like a menial task or whatever no see the issue is this game

1137
04:54:39,849 --> 04:54:48,919
I can kind of pick up and jump in for four or five hours or so um not a hundred hours right I mean

1138
04:54:48,919 --> 04:54:55,799
I can just play I can clean up the skate park I can be done I can do this in a couple hours but

1139
04:54:55,799 --> 04:55:07,959
when the whole game is a menial task and it's like a hundred hours long I'm not into it I would I

1140
04:55:07,959 --> 04:55:13,319
wouldn't be able to get through death stranding I know that it's a good game but I just um after

1141
04:55:13,319 --> 04:55:22,439
hour number 20 or 30 I'd be like I don't want to do this anymore I'd just be like that's a bad take

1142
04:55:22,439 --> 04:55:32,340
jackass I just said just wait why I just said the game is probably a great game but I might I just

1143
04:55:32,340 --> 04:55:36,419
I don't have attention span for stuff like that I don't have attention span for anything that's

1144
04:55:36,419 --> 04:55:42,860
over 50 plus hours for a game um and you probably say what about Elden Ring that's a once in a

1145
04:55:42,860 --> 04:55:50,380
lifetime video game there will never be another Elden Ring that is the Super Bowl of all video

1146
04:55:50,380 --> 04:55:57,799
games at this point like it's just come on it's once in a generation Sekiro didn't take me 100

1147
04:55:57,799 --> 04:56:09,479
hours Sekiro was like 40 Dark Souls 3 was like 40 30 45 whatever it was what about Red Dead Red

1148
04:56:09,479 --> 04:56:32,819
Dead wasn't 100 hours okay oh that's what we're missing right here got it this should be it too

1149
04:56:32,819 --> 04:56:41,189
not quite um what am I missing this place looks phenomenal is it just all the bullshit on the

1150
04:56:41,189 --> 04:56:58,150
ground here is it all this crap it's all this stuff that's oh my god it's everywhere all

04:58:17,189 --> 04:58:38,169
me he who will not be named oh yeah there's other game modes I'm gonna I'm gonna try I'll try the

1155
04:58:38,169 --> 04:58:42,459

1156
04:58:42,540 --> 04:59:27,290
don't try it 97 percent come on Gwen really where is there another three percent top of the wall
