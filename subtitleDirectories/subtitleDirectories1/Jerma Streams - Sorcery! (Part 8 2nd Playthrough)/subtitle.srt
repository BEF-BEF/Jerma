1
00:00:23,800 --> 00:01:00,619
It's funny, I saw somebody write in all capitals, exclamation point, sus, question mark question, like where is he, how's it going, ow, fuck, my elbow, I'm sorry, ow, oh, that was a bad one, that was right in the spot that just shuts you off for like a full two minutes, eee, why, why does it always do that, why is it always that same spot, it's always there, I couldn't try to do that if I wanted to again.

2
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:29,340
Anyways, how you doing? Happy almost fourth of July, not quite there yet, but it's tomorrow. It is very, very hot. It's currently, how hot is it right now in Vegas, it is 112 degrees Fahrenheit outside right now. It is fucking brutal.

3
00:01:29,340 --> 00:02:17,180
I'm sitting here drinking a cold drink. Somebody say only, only 112 degrees. I love it like this though. I actually, there actually might be something wrong with me. I really do like it. But hope you're doing good. Gonna play sorcery today. I got a plan for this week, if you'd like to hear it. Can you please do the Steve Jackson's sorcery thing that you do sometimes? Wait, what'd you say? I already did it, it's in the title.

4
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:45,300
That's what the title is. Well, actually, hold on. It would be Steve Jackson's. All right, I forgot to put Steve Jackson's in the front because it's Steve Jackson's sorcery. Yeah, you're right. I got it wrong. Mods, mods, mods, can you fix it? Yeah, so we're gonna play sorcery.

5
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:45,939
I'm gonna kind of beat the heat tonight, today. Just gonna chill out, have some fun. I'm into it. I'm into it. So that's what we're doing today. Do this for like three or four hours. From there, on Thursday, we're gonna play trepang 2. I believe that game has released. Gonna play it for a little while on Thursday. And then on Saturday, we're probably gonna do a browser berry stream, where I get a bunch of browser games,

6
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:58,020
and browser quizzes, and just do browser berry plan. Let me go over the house flipper stuff. There's a lot of people saying, what is what are you talking about today supposed to be the house flipper invitational stream? And yes, I agree. It's supposed to be today. But I forgot it was the fourth of July tomorrow. A lot of people their timings. I didn't want to be like, hey, yeah, let's come to the house flipper invitational stream. I think it's just easier to get more people to be involved.

7
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:16,389
Next week, I'm planning for next week, I'll give you a date. Everybody else seems to agree that I've been talking to so far that next week is probably just better anyways. Shooting for probably the 11th. It might change, but it's going to be the week that of the 11th.

8
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:34,790
To delay Andy moment. Well, I wanted to get as many people as I could. So the more available people can be, the better. And I didn't want to go to scheduling conflicts with people. There's other stuff going on. There's fourth of July. And yeah, I figured it would just be easier to do it next week.

9
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:53,089
I'm glad you moved it. I can only be here for like 15 minutes right now. That's another thing to Yeah, I just let's let's get it away from fourth of July. What happened to house flipper? I think you just clicked on the stream one second ago.

10
00:04:54,649 --> 00:05:01,089
Yeah, which I mean, look, the stream just started. I understand that. I you may have just got here a second ago, right at the when I ended the last sentence.

11
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:21,350
I did. All right. Yeah, there we go. Alright, so rewind rewind, literally 10 seconds. That's so funny. See, and now let me just Okay, this is amazing. I'm glad this happened. So you see now why I usually say wait, I don't want to talk about something yet.

12
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:40,819
We need to wait like 2030 minutes into the stream. People like just fucking say it already. Oh, he's stalling. He's stalling. No, no, I want to wait. Oh, he wants to wait for people to quote trickle in. Yeah. Do you see now why we do this? You're a liar. You can't rewind.

13
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:59,819
No, not trickled. That's not what I just said. Yeah, you got to let people trickle in. People have to open the stream. I look some of you get here really quick.

14
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:39,470
But for an announcement, we usually have to wait for people to get here. There's traffic. There is traffic. Just go. I am. Alright, so here's the deal. Browserberry this weekend, Trippang on Thursday. So it's free today. Trippang is really good. I'm, I'm, I'm ready.

15
00:06:43,040 --> 00:07:10,009
Bark, bark, bark. Who's barking? Why are you barking? Stop barking at us. It's fire. Trippang is fire. All right. Yeah, the Sorcerer Enjoyers Council. You can rejoice because I think a lot of you and I have to give myself some credit here. A lot of you just thought like, oh yeah, fuck this guy.

16
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:26,089
We're like forcing him to play this. It's been a year since he played it last. He's just doing this to like shut everybody up that wants to see it and he'll probably just never play it ever again. This is the third or fourth stream since we came back to it a year later.

17
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:44,959
Do you see what's going on here? I want you to, I would like you to say sorry to me because I saw comments that were like, oh yeah, I'm making these up by the way. Oh yeah, he's never going to play it again. He's only doing it once. I made all those up, but I'd like the imaginary people to apologize to me, please.

18
00:07:44,959 --> 00:08:31,660
All right, let's go. You made them all up. You made up all, what did you say? You made all those one comment. Oh, what about Demon's Souls remake? I don't know. Yeah, maybe. Can I tell you that I'm afraid to play the Demon's Souls remake? Can we go over why? The Demon's Souls remake? Go over it. Yeah, okay. All right. A lot of you saying no, but that's fine. It's my stream.

19
00:08:32,659 --> 00:09:07,759
So I put Demon's Souls up in like the top three of from software games and I'm kind of afraid that I'm going to play the remake and it's going to be shown to me in full HD in full color. That's not the case or something. It's scary to me. That's probably what is going to happen because I told you, I went back and played Dark Souls three off stream and I have told you guys that Dark Souls three was like, oh man, it's definitely up in like the top three top four for from software games.

20
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:42,460
And I played through Dark Souls three and I was just like, I fucking hate this game. I was like, what happened? Why do I hate this? I love this one. Don't I? I like really like this one. And then I played through Dark Souls one off stream again. And I was like, this is good. I hate this one though. Don't I? I'm afraid to play Dark Souls two. I'm going to play Dark Souls two and it's going to be my favorite game of all time. I'm afraid of that. Dark Souls three sucks.

21
00:09:43,460 --> 00:10:16,980
I don't know. I don't think so. I really don't think so. But it's weird because I was OK. So Holly's sitting next to me and she's like, oh, just sit down and hang out and play games on the couch. Right. And it really did feel like every few hours I would kind of glance over and be like, oh, this area sucks. This is like one of the everyone that kind of agrees this is one of the worst areas in the game. And it kind of felt like I was saying that for every area in the game. And I think she was like, what area is good?

22
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm like, well, I mean, that's good. I like I kind of forgot like what I liked about Dark Souls three every few hours. Bro knows Dark Souls three sucks. No, it really doesn't. I just think you know what I think it is. On a second, third play through of some of these games, you start to go, ah, yeah, I remember that. I remember that that guy that jumps out there. Yeah. What the fuck? Like when you know what these games, the tricks these games play, you kind of are like, yeah, what the hell?

23
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:36,639
Yeah. Why would you do that to me? Why did you do that to me? It was new to me when I first played it. But like, yeah, now I'm doing it again. It's like, why would you do that to me? I'm so mad at you. All from software games. And this is the thing that when you make like a from software tier list, they're all good. They're all good. They all sit in this book of wonderful video games. They all know that they all suck. No, they don't. They're in a league of their own. Yes, they are. VR Josh just asked me, do you ever worry you get to an age

24
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:58,610
where you just can't beat a Souls game anymore? Like you won't be able to beat Bloodborne again because your motor skills and reaction times have diminished? Yeah. I mean, no, that's a that's a good point. It is like when Dark Soul wouldn't I don't know when Dark Souls seven comes out.

25
00:12:01,169 --> 00:12:12,129
Well, I actually be able to beat it. Well, will I go back and be like, yeah, I remember when I could do this. Wow. How was I? I was you know, no, no, no. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is like sports shit.

26
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:27,059
If I could throw a football 100 yards when I'm like 25, when I'm 70, I can remember when I could throw the football 100 yards. I can't do that anymore. But I used to I used to be able to do that. And yeah, that's that's fine.

27
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:49,700
Like, oh, you should have saved me when I got up to the plate. I could hit a home run. It's like, Grandpa, you can't do that anymore. But you could before. That's fine. That doesn't bother me. You did this rant while fighting millennia. I'll be honest with you. I don't remember fighting millennia.

28
00:12:50,970 --> 00:13:24,580
I'll watch clips of that fight and that like the six hours that I over a few streams. I don't remember any of it. I just I don't remember that entire fight. I just remember just I don't I just don't know. I remember talking about how I put like a black and white filter on and was pretending that it was like back in like the 1920s or something. I don't I don't remember much else. We don't want to talk about you getting old. It makes us sad. We all we all get older.

29
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:57,299
OK, it's it happens to everybody. It's happening to me right now. It's going to happen to all of us. So why don't we talk about something a little nicer? Let's talk about the sunflowers and the update that you're not going to receive today because we're not ready to show it. But almost all the heads are open. The sunflowers we have the we've got all the colors. I'm going to spoil it. For those of you that it's really cool to do the sunflower loot box.

30
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:30,620
Because you can get variety of sunflowers that are different colors. There's red, there's purple, yellow, brown. There's all kinds of varieties of sunflowers. So when you do the loot box, you just kind of pick random seeds and you put it, you know, put it in the ground, take care of them. You don't know what they're going to look like. You don't know what color they're going to be. So it's really, really cool to watch it go from seed. Take months to grow. You see the head forming. You're like, what color is that going to be? That's going to be interesting.

31
00:14:30,820 --> 00:15:12,700
It's a lot of fun. I highly recommend it. If you're all right, if you're going to bat-chest the sunflower shtick on this channel, be gone. Be gone is what I would say. You don't bat-chest the sun. I'm sorry. That's not how this works. Be gone. Go. Be go. Go. You said loot box. Yeah, but I mean, I'm just making a reference to stop this at once. Yeah, nature bat-chest nature.

32
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:44,440
I recommend to everybody to take seeds. Go for it. Go from seed to full plant. They become like children. It was it was a little windy here recently. And I remember being like, our children, we have to save them. Okay, maybe we can block the wind out and save them. Like they become like actual children.

33
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:51,059
No, we don't want them. Our sunflowers are going to get the wind is going to take them and they're going to be hurt by it.

34
00:15:53,090 --> 00:16:17,820
When you do it from seed to full plant, you're out there every day and you're making sure the soil is okay. What's the temperature like? What direction are they facing? How many how much nutrients have they taken in this week? It's it's actually remarkable. It's all jokes aside, I really do recommend that you do it. I feel like it changes your perspective on a lot of things.

35
00:16:17,820 --> 00:17:08,339
I feel like you really, it really does. When you see something grow over the course of a few months, and you did that and you helped. I think it makes you think a little differently. Seriously. Yeah, with all my parcels of land. That's the thing. A lot of flowers and a lot of plants do very well in a pot doesn't you don't need a whole lot of space. You need water sunshine in a decent little pot to put them in. Plant father, plant dad, God complex.

36
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:25,809
Oh, man, I really like, you know, seeing the work you put into something and having it grow and you take care of it and you can. Wow. Like, I feel so happy about like contributing to maybe to nature and what a God complex you have.

37
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:51,529
You're growing weed. I'm not. No, I'm not growing weed. I'm growing sunflowers, marigolds and wildflowers. OK, can I start the stream already? It's been like 45 minutes.

38
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:05,220
All right, let's go. So our story time, but I want we need to talk about it. I want to be. I don't. I just want to. I want to talk sometimes. This guy thinks he's inventing oxygen.

39
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:35,710
See how windy it is here. You see, you hear that, right? All right. This is where we were. For those of you that need a little recap, we can do it quickly. As you see, the seven serpents are coming after us.

40
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,240
We did most of the swamp last time.

41
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,099
We got some info on this is the earth serpent and the water serpent.

42
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,410
We are on our way to go here. What does it say about the earth serpent?

43
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,980
Said something, right? I don't think sunflowers produce oxygen.

44
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:05,160
No, but they. Hey, look, it doesn't matter.

45
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,660
It doesn't matter. And listen to this. What do they do?

46
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:15,940
Yeah, I'm sure they do. All plants do.

47
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,630
I was just reading a chat. I was reading a chat message.

48
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:29,009
You just threw me off so bad. Well, I was thinking, what was I going to say?

49
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,019
Shit, there was a really important point there.

50
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:40,579
Oh, and not only that, you get to you get to if you sit out there.

51
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,339
And yes, I know, stalling, stalling, whatever. This is fine.

52
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,579
We it's just just relax.

53
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:51,069
You get to see if you just sit out there and just kind of watch.

54
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:58,410
We have these big tall sunflowers and you get to see kind of the whole world that you're not paying attention to.

55
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:05,789
But when you start to pay attention, you start to recognize little creatures.

56
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:09,049
There's a hummingbird that keeps coming back.

57
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,339
And we've recognized this hummingbird like the same one every time.

58
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,500
There are a couple of their wasps, but they're I believe they're

59
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,180
are there be this bees, this wasps.

60
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,940
I think they're Potter wasps is what we're seeing.

61
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,420
And obviously, honeybees and big bumblebees, you start to recognize

62
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,339
almost like individually, you remember what they look like.

63
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,619
It's like, wait, they're here every day.

64
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:50,450
Nature is so cool with the bat chest.

65
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,759
Well, let me tell you something. Yeah, that's OK.

66
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:01,700
You will get a pot. You go plant a seed, take care of it and take a look at it

67
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,940
and make it a little hobby.

68
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,940
And you come back and tell me how you feel.

69
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,019
Go do it. Go do it.

70
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,140
And when you and when you fucking water

71
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,819
that plant for the first time, really, when it's tall enough

72
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,940
and you see this thing just kind of come to life,

73
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,069
it's like, wait, hold on, like an hour ago, your leaves were kind of

74
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,470
a little bit facing down, but now they're way up in the air.

75
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,950
You can see it in real time.

76
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,480
It's like, holy shit.

77
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:48,569
Wow. Cool.

78
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,490
Remember, we have human children.

79
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,130
We understand. Do the wizard voice.

80
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,119
I know you have.

81
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:02,099
OK. Oh, anyways.

82
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,859
Oh, down the slope, we go to find

83
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,980
what could be potential disaster waiting for us.

84
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:14,319
You make your way.

85
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,759
I like plants.

86
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,480
You make your way down the mountainside slowly being care.

87
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,970
Wait, we didn't even do the recap.

88
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,799
Yeah, we did. All right.

89
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,359
So we're going down here at Lake Iklala.

90
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,640
We had a run in with the time serpent, the water serpent.

91
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,359
Did we know what the weakness for the earth serpent was?

92
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,869
It's probably in the spell book clues.

93
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,190
Where is it? All right.

94
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,670
The earth serpent, the earth serpents weakness

95
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,329
becomes weakened when it loses contact with the ground.

96
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,609
All right. So we need to probably going to have to blow the horn.

97
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,519
You're a fucking weirdo.

98
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,339
Just wait till you have your own plants.

99
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,980
I walked by plants like, oh, whatever is green thing

100
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,059
that grows out of the ground. I was like that for years.

101
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,420
But once you actually get in there and you take care of one

102
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,750
and it grows from seed all the way, we have children.

103
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:30,029
I don't care. OK, we know what to do.

104
00:23:30,029 --> 00:23:32,869
Do you think he's the only gardener?

105
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,549
I didn't say that.

106
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,109
I'm just saying for those of you that don't have never thought about it,

107
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:39,750
it's actually a really nice, interesting hobby.

108
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,190
It's nice. It gets you outside, gets the sun in your face.

109
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:44,569
You look up, you just kind of close your eyes and just like,

110
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:52,579
ah, this is a crazy day of take.

111
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,720
We have children. You don't have children.

112
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,299
I'm sorry.

113
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,660
I don't know what the percentage of people that have kids in this community is.

114
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,579
I don't know how high it is.

115
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:06,980
Even if it's like 30 percent, even if it's 40 to 50 percent,

116
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,970
that means half of you don't.

117
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,410
It's probably like maybe 10 percent of everybody here.

118
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,440
20 percent, maybe.

119
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,000
That was the plant podcast.

120
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,289
Oh, by the way,

121
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:29,369
me and Holly were sitting outside and a hummingbird flew

122
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,410
and floated in front of us for like 10 full seconds.

123
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,009
And it was magical. Yeah. All right.

124
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,049
Whatever. Yeah. What do you know?

125
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,630
All right. You make your way down the mountainside slowly,

126
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,700
being careful with your footing on the scree, rising winds

127
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,539
finger at your hair and cloak.

128
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,579
Road down the slope passes a small stone house.

129
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,220
The aged wooden door stands a crack ajar.

130
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,809
Look inside. You peer inside the house.

131
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,839
It is dark inside, but you can make out furniture coated by layers of dust.

132
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,900
Seems that this place is in no is no ruin,

133
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,980
but it's clearly been uninhabited for some time.

134
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:11,940
The door creaks on its own, its worn hinges as you push it open.

135
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:20,250
Now, where is this?

136
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,730
My childhood friend once ate a huge bee.

137
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,130
All right. Yeah, that's nice.

138
00:25:30,349 --> 00:25:32,920
What do I say to that?

139
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,440
Like what you like, they opened their mouth and a bee flew in.

140
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,049
What are you talking about?

141
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah. Was their name Eric?

142
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,539
Was it your buddy, Eric?

143
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:45,890
Hold on. What does this person say?

144
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,970
Sunflowers freak me the fuck out.

145
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,289
It's like they see everything around them.

146
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:52,690
And I swear, once a sunflower called me a sunglass loser, whatever.

147
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,910
I mean, that was kind of funny.

148
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,099
They move. They move around.

149
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,380
If you look, OK, these sunflowers at 10 o'clock in the morning,

150
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,930
they're facing a different direction.

151
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,930
Then like four hours later, they are completely moved.

152
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:13,930
They're facing a completely different.

153
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,039
They move around. They're alive.

154
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,789
They're alive and we have to take care of them.

155
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,980
OK, anyways, it's because they're facing the sun.

156
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,420
Yeah, they move.

157
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,099
All right. The inside of the hut is simple.

158
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:39,450
But as you saw, well kept in the center of the room is a table with one wooden stool.

159
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,009
And in one corner is a straw mattress caught.

160
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,140
A cauldron sits in a hearth with a roasting spit above it.

161
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:49,250
By the far wall is a sculling boat.

162
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,500
It's in the cauldron.

163
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,069
You peer into the cauldron.

164
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:58,190
But if there was ever anything edible inside, it has long since turned to dust.

165
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:04,819
The pot is quite empty under the table.

166
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:08,299
You peer under the table, looking for trapped doors or long lost items.

167
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,430
But there's nothing of interest there.

168
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:19,210
It is clear that the boat is an ornament or else the owner intended to repair it,

169
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:21,299
but made no progress.

170
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,380
It has several planks missing, no paint, and woodworm has been burrowing

171
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,660
constellations into its sides.

172
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,940
But once it must have been a serviceable coracle.

173
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,670
It is clear there is nothing here.

174
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,789
You turn to go.

175
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:38,490
And that is when you see the skeleton tied to the wall above the doorframe.

176
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:49,990
Leave quickly or look at the skeleton.

177
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:55,809
Look at the skeleton. You stare up at it.

178
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,289
The figure must have been a big man once.

179
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,329
He has wide leg bones now strapped with leather through iron pins

180
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:04,190
hammered into the stone.

181
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,829
And his shoulders are broad and stocky, now attached to hooks

182
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,730
that still bear the trace of blood.

183
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,410
His empty skull hangs low, sockets staring at the floor.

184
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,720
Aside from the gruesome nature, there is something very strange about it all.

185
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,099
We do zap.

186
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,460
I don't know why we would electrocute the skeleton for no reason.

187
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:41,559
Can I read the skeleton's mind?

188
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,039
Bro, you don't even do voices anymore.

189
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,349
What the hell? I'm the narrator.

190
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,109
There is nobody. There's no quotes.

191
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:48,789
There's nobody.

192
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:52,309
It's not like the skeleton perks his head up and says, hello, traveler.

193
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:55,180
Like, there's no I'm I'm the narrator.

194
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,089
The narrator doesn't have a funny voice.

195
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,410
The narrator is telling you what's going on in the room.

196
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:12,809
I ought to do big res resurrect the dead.

197
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,109
Try resurrect.

198
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:19,319
Can I resurrect this guy?

199
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,880
I have holy water.

200
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:35,750
I this I think I only have one.

201
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,990
Hold on. You can see the background for a second.

202
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,940
Sorry. Let's do it.

203
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,980
You take the vial of holy water from your pack and cast your spell.

204
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,980
The water begins to shimmer and shine with an inner light.

205
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,819
Then you toss the holy water at the hanging skeleton.

206
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:58,910
After a moment, the spell takes effect and the creature's head suddenly lifts up.

207
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,240
The skull turns this way and that and the arms tug at their restraints.

208
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,529
Who are you?

209
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,130
Skeleton's head snaps around as though searching for you.

210
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,690
It tugs and pulls at its bonds once more and jaw flaps.

211
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:24,359
But it seems unable to speak.

212
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,670
All right. Now we do tell.

213
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:37,420
Yep. 100 percent.

214
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,500
You weave the stars into order around you, pulling on the cloth

215
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,420
scale cap as you do.

216
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,819
The creature's thoughts enter your head, musty and confused,

217
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,140
as though covered in dust.

218
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,140
He seems to be in a state of terror.

219
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,349
Unable to breathe or see.

220
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:55,150
But he believes these things to be the result of a powerful wind

221
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,109
that has pinned him here against the wall,

222
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:01,130
snatched his breath and forced his eyes closed.

223
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,250
What happened?

224
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,609
You try to guide his thoughts back to before the wind began.

225
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,019
And the last thing he remembers is an image of opening the door

226
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:20,079
to reveal a towering coiled serpent that opened its mouth and created a hurricane.

227
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,390
And that is all.

228
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,069
The skeleton struggles and tugs, but it is clearly very dead.

229
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,720
As the spell does not last long.

230
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,799
After a few more rattles, it falls still.

231
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,769
You leave the hut to continue your walk. Oh, shit.

232
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,019
Um, do we go try to confront?

233
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,180
I think I think we can confront the earth serpent.

234
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,420
Let's confront the earth serpent because I have the horn,

235
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:59,980
which should make quick work of the earth serpent, according to the clues.

236
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,579
You pick your way down the slope and meet the old road.

237
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,940
Sun continues to climb the steep sky.

238
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,690
You stand in the foothills of the mountains.

239
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,809
Looking east, the wide waters of Lake Klaala gleam in the sunlight.

240
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:17,059
A high point of the rocks would make a good place to stop and eat.

241
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,140
Just to the south is a deep fissure in the land,

242
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,740
as though something gigantic had stamped its foot and cracked the earth.

243
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,480
Throw the sun serpent orb into the fissure.

244
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,680
How do we actually kill the sun serpent?

245
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,140
Actually, I don't remember.

246
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,670
I'm going to throw him in there and he's going to come out and kill us.

247
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,210
Sturr says you won't collab with him.

248
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,539
I invited Sturr to the house flipper stream.

249
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:58,579
What are you talking about? You just making shit up.

250
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,279
OK, you stand in the foothills of the mountains.

251
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,440
OK, so what should we look in the fissure?

252
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,349
What do you guys want to do? Did it happen already?

253
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:22,539
Nope. Fourth of July is moving it to next week.

254
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:25,529
I'm shooting for the 11th, July 11th.

255
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,460
That's what I'm trying to do.

256
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,690
Trying to get a bunch of people there.

257
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,569
I don't want to give you exactly who's going to be there because I don't know.

258
00:33:32,569 --> 00:33:35,140
I need to apply different schedules and trying to work around a lot.

259
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
I just I'm working on it. I'm working on it.

260
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,819
Don't worry. It's going to be a lot. It's going to be a great time.

261
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:44,900
It's going to be a lot of fun.

262
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,740
And look at this. And nobody has to do it.

263
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:48,180
You know what I'm saying?

264
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,579
It's just like it's a fun thing just to do.

265
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:58,420
If it works out, it works out.

266
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,339
I think we're going to look and look in the fissure.

267
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,599
You didn't tweet this stream.

268
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,480
I didn't. Oh, I didn't.

269
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,780
It's just sitting here waiting to be tweeted.

270
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,369
Does it really matter if I do this?

271
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:22,489
All right. I did it.

272
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,010
You know, I haven't. Can we talk about?

273
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,630
I know this is like a podcast stream.

274
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,719
I have not looked at like Twitter analytics to see if anybody even clicks on this.

275
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,599
I just do it.

276
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,239
I just I just tweet every stream.

277
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,579
I don't even know if it's doing anything.

278
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,639
I think I want to go look at this and see if.

279
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,900
Oh, yeah, it's the engagements of of your.

280
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,900
I'm just live right now.

281
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,500
Stuff like eight people clicked on it.

282
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,510
I don't know. I have no idea.

283
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,909
It's something that I just started doing and got used to doing.

284
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,860
It became a routine nearly 10 years ago.

285
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,159
So it's just like, oh, I just I just I tweet every time I'm live.

286
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,840
But I won't tweet a banger like this,

287
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,300
which this is just the way it is.

288
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:27,829
Yeah, I won't tweet a banger like this.

289
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:31,110
Sitting on the toilet in the hotel, I glance over at the mirror.

290
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,550
I see someone in the shower looking at me.

291
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,010
I get into fucking attack mode, ready to elbow drop a motherfucker.

292
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,369
It's one of those beveled edge mirrors that at the right angle

293
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:51,159
shows two of you in different spots like that one.

294
00:35:51,599 --> 00:36:00,380
It's pretty good, I think.

295
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,619
Do I have to give context? All right.

296
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,699
So no, I don't have to give context.

297
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,780
I was sitting on the toilet in a hotel one time and I was just sitting there

298
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,539
and the mirror was like in the at a level where I could see the mirror

299
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,619
sitting on the toilet.

300
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:13,739
I look over.

301
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,460
I see myself.

302
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,139
The mirror had beveled edges, so it was like almost like a double kind of mirror.

303
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:21,980
So there were two people in the mirror

304
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,340
and it looked like one of them was in the shower.

305
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,619
And I was like, I have to fucking fight somebody on the toilet.

306
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,179
I'm I'm ready to fucking fight.

307
00:36:29,179 --> 00:36:31,260
I'm ready to attack somebody.

308
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,179
And then it was like it was like a half of a second.

309
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,360
What does beveled edges mean?

310
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,500
It means that there's like a it's like a I don't know.

311
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
I just said it. It means that that I could explain this.

312
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,489
You got me under stress right now.

313
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:53,510
A beveled edge mirror is there's a OK, there's a long rectangle.

314
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,670
That's a mirror.

315
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,519
There's a section that is there's a gap

316
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,760
in between another section that kind of sticks out.

317
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,460
So it's technically like two mirrors.

318
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,250
You know, do you understand what I'm saying when I say this?

319
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,340
It's like angled edges and there's a gap in between.

320
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,550
You know, you have to know what I'm talking about.

321
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,550
It's like curved, like down a little.

322
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:21,949
Everyone knows what I'm talking about.

323
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:31,409
You're just saying this to make me look like a weirdo.

324
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,630
Like a photo frame. Yes.

325
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,269
But those beveled, those edges were large, very large.

326
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:40,820
It wasn't just like a little like half inch or an inch.

327
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,380
Those beveled edges were probably like four or five inches long.

328
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:49,579
That's why this kind of illusion happened.

329
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:51,659
We have kids. We know what a beveled mirror is.

330
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:56,409
All right, let's go.

331
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,849
All right. Now, no more discussions.

332
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:03,250
I have to play. I'm playing sorcery.

333
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,610
Move on. That's what I'm saying.

334
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,650
And I'm doing it right now.

335
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,250
You thought it was a two way mirror?

336
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,289
No, there were two heads in the mirror.

337
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,929
I looked over, my head was in the bevel

338
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:23,690
and my head again was copied up in the actual mirror.

339
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,530
Therefore, me thinking there was another person in the fucking room

340
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,369
hiding in the fucking shower.

341
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,409
So I like I freaked out for a tenth of a second.

342
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:35,820
I was like, oh, that's just me.

343
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:45,679
All right, let's go. You're so sassy today.

344
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,119
I'm just I'm in a good mood.

345
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,480
I'm in a really good mood today.

346
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,300
So that's why I'm like this right now.

347
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,380
I'm in a very like talkative.

348
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,730
I'm just I'm in a good mood.

349
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,059
All right, here we go.

350
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,260
You stride boldly to the edge of the fissure

351
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:03,460
and peer over the edge to look for the serpent.

352
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,199
You can see nothing but an endless drop.

353
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,289
Didn't it say that the serpent was in the fissure?

354
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,820
It did, right? Hiding in a fissure.

355
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,210
OK, yeah, this piece of shit is in here.

356
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:31,619
Try to step back.

357
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,219
You keep watching.

358
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:37,539
Suddenly a rock explodes out of the ground, just a few spans from where you stand.

359
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:40,510
It begins to roll down the slope towards the fissure,

360
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:45,030
but then abruptly it stops, reverses direction and begins to roll towards you.

361
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:54,809
Do I just stay still?

362
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,630
Dodge left, dodge right.

363
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,820
I'm a dodge left guy.

364
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,139
If you've watched any from software playthroughs, I seem to only dodge left and back.

365
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,190
You dodge left and the rock shoots past you,

366
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:13,190
impacting into dust against an overhang.

367
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,989
The rumbling is growing louder and even bigger explosion is coming.

368
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,579
Could you shield?

369
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:41,099
Can I do wall, magic protection, fog, summon darkness?

370
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,860
That's an interesting one.

371
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,900
Create a force field.

372
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,300
That might be helpful.

373
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,619
I can't float.

374
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:55,309
Um, I could blow the horn.

375
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:56,989
I don't think I want to blow the horn right now, though.

376
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:06,300
I haven't we've been seeing the serpent.

377
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,659
I don't want to burn through stamina either.

378
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:12,170
Dose is slowness.

379
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,380
That might be a good idea.

380
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:20,929
Slow everything down.

381
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:26,349
Well, that's slow me down.

382
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:31,519
Force field seems the smartest, but it's also three stamina.

383
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:37,409
Let's go for it.

384
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,369
You cast the spell, forming a shimmering force field around your body.

385
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,010
You should be protected from all but the most serious injury now.

386
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:47,809
Just in time, the rock surface explodes

387
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,570
and you are showered with falling stones.

388
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,519
They bounce harmlessly off your force field,

389
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:01,039
but you are knocked off your feet all the same.

390
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,159
The ground opens up directly where you fall,

391
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:10,340
forming the shape of a freshly dug grave in the bottom.

392
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,420
You're at the bottom of a deep pit.

393
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,500
Dust and small stones are still raining over the lip with a pop.

394
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,699
Your force field shimmers out of existence.

395
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:31,340
Look around. The walls of the pit are smooth, not carved,

396
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,179
as though this pit had been drilled.

397
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:36,179
There is no way to climb out.

398
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,860
The earth below is creaking and hissing with steam.

399
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:44,769
You're about nine feet below the rim of the pit.

400
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,969
You may be able to jump and grab the edge, but it is unlikely.

401
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,980
Suddenly, a rocky protrusion breaks through the pit floor.

402
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,500
It glows red. It is boiling hot.

403
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:04,219
Look at the spike.

404
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,579
The spike of rock sticks up from the floor.

405
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:10,420
It glows a deep and boiling red and steam rises from its sides

406
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,269
where it touches the cold air.

407
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:15,710
As you consider your options, you feel something bite your ankle.

408
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,760
Doc, this is not poisonous, is it?

409
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:34,190
I don't have a potion.

410
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,360
Zen, I could hover.

411
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,369
That might not be a bad idea.

412
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:48,079
Fix caused fixness.

413
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,519
You should use.

414
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:54,050
Oh, sorry. Not a bad idea.

415
00:43:54,050 --> 00:44:06,309
Mud. I don't want to waste my sand.

416
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:19,949
Oh, let me float. Let's hover.

417
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,309
You craft the enchantment

418
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:23,869
and the medallion begins to glow as you rise gently into the air.

419
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,420
Float out of the pit.

420
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,099
You float up out of the pit,

421
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,099
which fills with burning hot rocks and lava just as you escape.

422
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:37,190
OK, outside the pit.

423
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:40,710
You are out of the pit, but the danger is by no means passed.

424
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:43,550
Cracks are radiating across the ground.

425
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:47,489
One opens between your feet.

426
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:49,170
I feel like we wait.

427
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,780
Should I jump clear?

428
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,750
What do you think? I think I'm going to wait.

429
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:02,909
Wait. You wait.

430
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:06,309
The crack opens below you and you tumble into a fissure in the rock.

431
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:13,190
Oh, God damn it. Pray to the ape.

432
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,750
You close your eyes and raise a prayer to the ape.

433
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:20,150
A moment later, another crack opens, collapsing one wall of the space

434
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,809
that holds you. You scramble quickly out.

435
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,480
Turning, you spot a large boulder on top of the rise

436
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,519
where you pause to rest teetering. God damn it.

437
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,230
Where is this motherfucker?

438
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:47,969
Dodge left. You prepare to dodge, but find something is holding your leg.

439
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,690
A small green snake has wrapped itself around your ankle

440
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,239
and is attempting to bite. Run it through.

441
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,489
You draw your sword to run the creature through when suddenly it begins

442
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:02,269
to grow in size.

443
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:06,429
The skin blisters and breaks and a huge winged serpent made of crystals

444
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:10,550
and rock coils up, spitting stone shards as it hisses.

445
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,579
This must be the Earth serpent itself.

446
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:21,000
Uh, throw something at it.

447
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,320
I don't think we do anything. I we just blow the horn.

448
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,829
Weakness, we know it.

449
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,659
We have the item still, right?

450
00:46:31,659 --> 00:46:33,519
Great wind. Yeah.

451
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:39,289
If you don't have a gale horn, this is this is pretty scary.

452
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,840
Create stench, cause speed.

453
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:52,079
Yeah, we know we have the clue.

454
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,619
We know what to do.

455
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:59,590
We go blow the horn.

456
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,710
Reaching up to the constellations, you create the spell,

457
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,389
raising the gale horn and blowing a shrill note.

458
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:08,380
A powerful wind is summoned, striking the wings of the snake

459
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,420
and lifting it up into the air.

460
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,380
The serpent roars and hisses.

461
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,619
But once off the ground, everything changes.

462
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,500
The Earth settles and the serpent itself shrinks once more

463
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,190
to the size of a small snake.

464
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:27,099
Try let it land or should I just strangle it?

465
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:28,179
Let it land.

466
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,659
I don't know if I want to.

467
00:47:29,659 --> 00:47:30,699
No, I don't think so.

468
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:41,159
I think we have to kill it right now. Strangle.

469
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,059
You catch the creature's throat in one fist and throttle the life from it.

470
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:54,420
It rattles, gasps and then hangs limp from your fist like an old rope.

471
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,019
The Earth below is still.

472
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:01,969
You have now defeated four of the seven serpents.

473
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:06,840
Your weight returns and you settle gradually back down to the ground.

474
00:48:07,699 --> 00:48:10,349
The rocks around are smooth and unbroken.

475
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:13,050
The whole thing might have been a dream,

476
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:18,840
but for the piles of stone dust that cover the ground, gather some dust.

477
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:22,539
You gather up the stone dust in your pack.

478
00:48:22,579 --> 00:48:25,059
You've dealt with more than half of the deadly serpents.

479
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:34,019
Nice. Very nice.

480
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:37,139
Hey, there's another one apparently right here.

481
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:42,840
But all right, what do you guys think?

482
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,349
Can we get a poll, maybe?

483
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:49,579
Go deal with the water serpent or go up to the town.

484
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,599
Town seems to be doing pretty poorly.

485
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,619
Can we get a poll?

486
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:01,699
I feel like I'm not sure.

487
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:09,059
I feel like it could go either way.

488
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:12,340
Go up to the town or down to this water serpent.

489
00:49:14,179 --> 00:49:15,260
Give it 60 seconds.

490
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,579
Maybe that's enough time for me to go pee,

491
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,260
because I forgot to before I started streaming.

492
00:49:18,260 --> 00:51:08,090
Give me a second. OK, I'm back.

493
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,030
That was quick. All right, up to the town.

494
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:16,190
Let's go. I told you it was going to be quick.

495
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,110
Pants around ankles, standing pee.

496
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:33,260
Oh, God. You wash your hands.

497
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,019
What? Yes.

498
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:38,500
What's your pee stance?

499
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,099
We're not getting into.

500
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,369
Can we bring up the sunflowers again?

501
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,050
We're not getting into pee stances.

502
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:53,019
What if you must know? Left hand on left hip.

503
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:03,800
I'm not even going to continue this.

504
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,400
No, I there are some like just dumb little non sequiturs and jokes

505
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,139
that I will say and then people go, oh, my God, that's what he does.

506
00:52:12,139 --> 00:52:14,340
And then you'll you'll post about it everywhere.

507
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,769
It's like, no, you're not going to get it out of me today.

508
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:30,610
OK, we're going to go up to the town.

509
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:36,420
Do you stand like Superman?

510
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,630
Yeah. And I go.

511
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,409
And I sing that song until I'm until I'm done.

512
00:53:00,699 --> 00:53:01,539
All right. All right. All right.

513
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:05,420
All right. Ninety five percent of the shit you hear is a joke.

514
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,820
All right. We all know that.

515
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,469
Just relax.

516
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:10,230
The road curves gently as you follow it.

517
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,309
Mid-afternoon heat makes the air damp.

518
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:19,289
The stone underfoot turns into carved slabs buried by layers of dust.

519
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:23,369
Seems you are walking along what once was a wide flagstone road.

520
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,579
You pause to look in the cracks between the stones. Sorry.

521
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,690
You pause to look in the cracks between stones,

522
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:38,170
hoping to perhaps find a gold piece or two buried under the topsoil.

523
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,139
There is nothing.

524
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:43,420
This place has been scoured bare by the wind of centuries.

525
00:53:44,369 --> 00:53:48,409
Looking northwards, you can see the northern reaches of the Zanzunu Peaks.

526
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:52,170
Somewhere there lie the ruins of an ancient city of Timpang,

527
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:55,179
once filled with the Archmage's most devout followers.

528
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:07,559
Follow the road. You follow the old road the afternoon is drawing on.

529
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,239
A little dust blows across the surface of the ancient road.

530
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:13,739
Suddenly you hear the sound of hoofbeats.

531
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:15,940
Something is coming towards you along the old stones.

532
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,199
The next thing you know, you are knocked flying by a low armored creature.

533
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:36,860
It is a roach pig.

534
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,360
This is just automatic. It's jig every time. It's automatic.

535
00:54:43,409 --> 00:54:44,809
If you have the flute, it's automatic.

536
00:54:44,809 --> 00:54:52,880
You pull the bamboo flute out and start to play.

537
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:59,110
The pig abruptly halts its charge and then awkwardly shuffles up onto its hind legs

538
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,889
and begins to sway from side to side.

539
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,920
Uh, dance until it drops or dance it away up the road.

540
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,210
Just up the road. Just get out of here.

541
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,010
You keep playing, directing the creature to hop, skip and rung

542
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:27,170
along the old flagstones until it's far out of sight.

543
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:31,010
Its wobbling, bloated form makes for quite a cheerful sight.

544
00:55:31,889 --> 00:55:35,780
When it is out of sight, you lower your pipe and you continue on your way.

545
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,289
Follow the road. The road curves gently as you follow it.

546
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,059
The evening is drawing in. It will be night soon.

547
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,099
The road passes between the pillars of a ruined stone gate

548
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,860
and then opens out into a wide plaza of low ruins.

549
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,360
Look at the gate. Look at the ruins.

550
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,599
Door frames jut from the unforgiving sands.

551
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,239
Windows stare like dead eyes from buildings molded into the rising cliff itself.

552
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:10,199
This place must have been magnificent once,

553
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,159
but now even the specters must have been shredded by the wind.

554
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:20,699
I just said, I hate you.

555
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,969
Will you just chill out? Just chill out. It's all right.

556
00:56:22,969 --> 00:56:25,650
Just relax. We can we can just all right.

557
00:56:27,019 --> 00:56:29,780
All right. The pillars were maybe once carved.

558
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:31,900
One is set with what looks like a jaguar.

559
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,960
The other, some kind of winged goat.

560
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,329
Perhaps this place was once walled, but there's nothing there now.

561
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:41,139
The pillars are covered in patches of green moss.

562
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:45,619
Oh, this is edible. It's wet and pungent.

563
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,579
Yeah, let's eat it.

564
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:49,380
You pop the moss.

565
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,659
We've eaten this moss before.

566
00:56:50,659 --> 00:56:52,920
You pop the moss into your mouth and chew.

567
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,960
A moment later, you are gagging and choking.

568
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,519
This moss is foul and disgusting with a flavor like rotting meat.

569
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,400
You spit the moss on the ground. Wrong moss.

570
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,090
Yellow moss was the edible one.

571
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:12,920
Oh, well, it's OK.

572
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,079
The Silent City echoes to the sound of your footsteps on the road.

573
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:20,190
You are aware you are headed away from Zamen and not towards it.

574
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,920
But perhaps the ruins of this place will have something to aid you.

575
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:33,260
Check it out. I know we're going to be going here.

576
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:37,059
You follow the outline of a street into the first of several open plazas.

577
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,510
It seems this was once a city,

578
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:42,349
hewn in vertical layers into the northern cliff base itself.

579
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:48,349
Now it is as though a great clawed creature has scratched it from existence.

580
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,869
A few dwellings remain, but more.

581
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:55,420
Most are broken pillars.

582
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,300
Only one structure remains standing.

583
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,420
A tower that rises somewhere to the west.

584
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,860
The sun lowers towards the horizon.

585
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:03,900
Soon it will be dark.

586
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,170
The foul flavor of the moss from the gate is still not quite left your mouth.

587
00:58:22,659 --> 00:58:25,179
Every time I watched your streams, I've done so while eating a burrito.

588
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,260
When you read that last passage, when you read it about eating moss,

589
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,719
I started salivating.

590
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,920
I now have a Pavlovian response to your streams in which I crave meat and tortilla.

591
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,059
Well, as long as you're eating well, OK?

592
00:58:46,519 --> 00:59:00,730
You can see my background for a second.

593
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:07,300
You're unconsciously. Yeah.

594
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,340
Now I'm craving meat and tortillas.

595
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,550
Look what you did.

596
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,670
Everybody right now is like, oh, my God, it sounds so good.

597
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,360
You just did that to everybody here.

598
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,519
Think about that. Think of the power you just have right now.

599
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,329
OK, the ruins of the city are quite extensive.

600
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:29,909
Whatever happened here is it happened to me.

601
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:36,719
Give me a sec. All right.

602
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,570
Whatever happened here, Karneasada, is that what you're talking about?

603
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:45,929
Because damn, whatever happened here, it scooped away great sections of the city,

604
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,380
as though the streets were raked by gigantic claws.

605
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:53,070
The grandest houses are those near the cliff face.

606
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:57,219
Further from the slope, the dwellings become smaller unless remains.

607
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:00,210
Clouds rumble as they roll across the dimming sky.

608
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,139
OK, I'm going to go up here first because it's closest.

609
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:09,269
We made five minutes of progress in an hour.

610
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:13,130
And the first like 30 minutes was we were doing a podcast.

611
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,099
The High City.

612
01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:22,900
You head upwards towards the cliff face, jumping over cracks in the ground

613
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,269
and then clamoring from the roof of one building into the gaping doorway of the next.

614
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:32,010
Mosaics in the floor and painted walls speak of great wealth,

615
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,760
but their patterns can no longer be discerned.

616
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,500
Let's search.

617
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,099
You search every corner and look through every window and crack,

618
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,139
but you find nothing.

619
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,780
It seems that when whoever lived here left, they took everything

620
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,659
they could carry with them.

621
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:49,699
On the highest street above the city, you find a house,

622
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:54,900
perhaps the grandest so far, whose stones are daubed in bright red paint.

623
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,619
Go inside.

624
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,699
You look inside the walls of the red painted house.

625
01:01:03,099 --> 01:01:06,699
Nothing remains, of course, just the outlines in the stone of a small room

626
01:01:07,059 --> 01:01:09,389
with a fire pit at the back.

627
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:12,800
Something white lies in the hearth, perhaps the remains

628
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,260
of something long since burned.

629
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,710
You go over to the fireplace.

630
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:26,110
And what look at first like discarded dice turn out to be a set of teeth.

631
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:30,500
You turn them over in your hands, trying to place what creature they are from.

632
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:37,130
Giant, a goblin, a snatacat, ape, human.

633
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,949
I don't know. We have plenty of goblin teeth.

634
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,369
We have a few giants teeth.

635
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:51,809
I don't know. Can we even do anything with with the ape teeth?

636
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,289
Snatacat, maybe? No.

637
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:06,059
Ape teeth are like human teeth, only larger.

638
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:10,579
And these are sharp and curved. Snatacats, then, of course,

639
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,570
they have the curved, talon like profile of a big cat's tooth.

640
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,079
You have found three. But what use they are.

641
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:23,380
Let's take them. You place them in your pack.

642
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,260
You now have seven teeth. Quite a collection.

643
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:36,840
All right. You continue along the curving street

644
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,340
until you pass a large doorway in the surprisingly intact ruins of a hall.

645
01:02:42,219 --> 01:02:46,139
Lying in the doorway is what looks like a massive oversized finger.

646
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:53,670
Look at the finger, a dead giant, perhaps.

647
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:57,300
If so, you might be able to acquire a few more precious teeth

648
01:02:57,659 --> 01:02:59,829
to add to your collection.

649
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:02,389
You follow the line of the finger inside the building

650
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:06,869
along the length of an arm that disappears under a pile of rubble and stones.

651
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,670
Kick the finger.

652
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,750
I feel like I should do this in case it's still alive.

653
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,400
You kick the finger and nothing happens.

654
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,929
OK, just in case.

655
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:23,400
Unbury the arm.

656
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
You go over to the rubble and begin to haul it away.

657
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,059
Once you have cleared a few rocks,

658
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:30,539
you begin to see the first wisps of thick hair

659
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,099
from the giant's beard underneath the stone.

660
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:37,429
If he is, in fact, dead, he cannot have died too long ago.

661
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:47,719
Maybe he's not dead. Keep working.

662
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:51,280
You keep working, removing stones with an aim to reaching the giant's lower jaw.

663
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:55,210
But after removing a flat slab of stone from across his mouth,

664
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,369
you are struck by a hot, wet blast of breath.

665
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:02,429
The giant is not dead at all.

666
01:04:02,429 --> 01:04:06,550
He is sleeping. Creep away.

667
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,579
I've got to get out of here.

668
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:09,260
What can I do?

669
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,639
Should I just cast zap like into his face?

670
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,510
Sharpen blade? No, I don't want to attack.

671
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:33,389
Turn to stone. Create an invisible wall.

672
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:50,739
Float in the air.

673
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:56,260
Just go big. All right, fine.

674
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,300
It's only one stamina.

675
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,590
I mean, it counters. It counters job.

676
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:07,019
I'm let's do it.

677
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:08,929
Oh, you cast a spell,

678
01:05:08,929 --> 01:05:10,889
swelling to tower over your surroundings,

679
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:13,570
but your spell casting has clearly agitated the creature.

680
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,489
It wakes instantly, roaring to its feet,

681
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:19,650
throwing aside the rest of the stone that has fallen out during its sleep

682
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,690
and grabbing a club from nearby.

683
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:26,739
This is bad.

684
01:05:26,739 --> 01:05:30,750
I mean, at least even with big, I'm up to his chest.

685
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:33,949
I only have five stamina.

686
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:36,150
I can't I have to defend.

687
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:41,980
Oh, what?

688
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,500
The giant shakes the ruin with a roar.

689
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:49,820
The giant swings its club and comes for you, determined to crack open your bones.

690
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,619
You raise your sword to cover your enormous body

691
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,340
as he tries to push you back with his great hand.

692
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:57,380
You are mostly unhurt.

693
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:01,989
He raises his club across his body defensively, defensively.

694
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,579
Let's say like, I don't know, maybe like a he might be doing zero.

695
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:11,460
I'm going to do one point seven.

696
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:15,090
That's all right.

697
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:20,050
Lumbering in, you move in, aiming to trap the giant against the far wall of the street,

698
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,449
teasing the giant with a passing blow, wearing him down.

699
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:26,420
He flicks your attack neatly away with his club.

700
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,900
He is left breathless, but otherwise unharmed.

701
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:35,340
Smelling your fear, he stomps the ground with one enormous foot growling.

702
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,769
He's coming in big.

703
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:43,800
Really? You've got so much stamina to attack power to work with.

704
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,949
You drop down, protecting yourself as best you can.

705
01:06:48,429 --> 01:06:51,590
As the giant swipes its terrible club, you step back.

706
01:06:51,590 --> 01:07:04,039
You are largely unscathed.

707
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:06,800
Germa, I think you meant large inhale in the title.

708
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
No, I didn't.

709
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,380
Oh, Steve Jackson's.

710
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:25,110
Oh, sorry. That was correct.

711
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,190
Four. Oh, I'm dead.

712
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:32,960
He's fucking crushed my head.

713
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,920
You attempt an attack and suffer for it.

714
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,440
The giant raises its enormous club and brings it crushing into you.

715
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:44,159
The gigantic club catches you square on the side of the head.

716
01:07:44,989 --> 01:07:49,469
That cracking sound is your skull splitting apart like a fruit.

717
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:01,000
This might be really hard with only five stamina.

718
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,280
All right. Small, but like three point three.

719
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,530
That should. All right.

720
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:09,900
Two. He stomps the ground with one enormous foot growling.

721
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,260
I'm going to go six point three.

722
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,340
That was unbelievably enormous.

723
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:18,430
Now I have to play it tactically.

724
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,630
You strike again, readying a massive blow that could part stone.

725
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:24,869
You stomp forward as the giant swings for your head.

726
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:27,270
The giant stumbles suddenly.

727
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:30,539
He is weakening, enraged by your attack.

728
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,579
He beats his club against his palm, readying himself.

729
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,300
I'm going to defend. Smart.

730
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:43,800
OK, you are just in time to move away to one side.

731
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,760
You are mostly unhurt.

732
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,760
He raises his club across.

733
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:53,270
He's OK defensively. Three, four.

734
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,079
Something. Let's go one point.

735
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:02,329
All right.

736
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:04,930
Lumbering and you move in and aiming to trap the giant against the wall.

737
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,850
OK, he is left breathless, but otherwise unharmed.

738
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:12,569
His stupid eyes are watching you closely, not wanting to take a risk.

739
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:21,649
OK, I'm going full blast because I'm going to defend next month.

740
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:28,300
That was a mistake on his part, and he's dead.

741
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,510
Should have defended.

742
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:34,109
You lunge forward again, preparing a massive swing

743
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:36,170
that could cleave a tree trunk.

744
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,170
You pound for your opponent.

745
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,369
Then your sword slips between the giant's ribs.

746
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:44,289
And he falls, gasping

747
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:47,689
his last in a noise like a gushing waterfall.

748
01:09:55,250 --> 01:10:02,859
And he dies.

749
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:05,949
You stagger back, wiping the sweat from your brow

750
01:10:05,949 --> 01:10:08,109
and regarding the fallen creature.

751
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,199
It is far from its Shuman Tanti home.

752
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:15,300
It must have become lost out here.

753
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:18,579
Now it will never return.

754
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:21,149
Take its teeth.

755
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:24,149
You go to remove the giant's teeth, but before you can get your sword

756
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:27,470
into the lower gum, the body of the creature begins to shrink

757
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,409
by almost a hand span.

758
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:34,149
A moment later, it shrinks again.

759
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:36,859
Get the teeth quickly.

760
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:39,619
You hurry over, aiming to work more quickly and have time to pry loose

761
01:10:39,619 --> 01:10:43,380
one tooth before the creature's mouth is shrunk to a normal human size.

762
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:47,010
And you're unable to fit the blade of your sword into its mouth.

763
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,140
But the tooth on the floor has shrunk as well.

764
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:55,500
Soon you are lying by a dead body holding one of its incisor teeth in your hand.

765
01:10:57,449 --> 01:11:00,729
Huh? This is a normal guy.

766
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:04,279
I'm keeping it.

767
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:06,520
You shove the tooth into your pouch,

768
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:09,439
though it is a macabre souvenir of this poor wretch.

769
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,220
Then you leave the body for whatever wild beast inhabit these ruins at night.

770
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:16,300
Your loop of the upper city is finished.

771
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,000
Gradually, you shrink back down to your normal size.

772
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,119
The sun is all but gone.

773
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:25,159
It'll be dark soon.

774
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:26,800
What? Macabre? Macabre?

775
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,369
How do you say it?

776
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:29,489
Isn't that how you say it?

777
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:37,850
How do you say it? Macabre?

778
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,750
It's macabre.

779
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,939
It's not macabre?

780
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:46,050
The R is silent.

781
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,890
It's French.

782
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,050
Did I just? OK, wait.

783
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:53,470
Did I just, like, did I just, like, jalapeno that?

784
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,300
Did I actually just jalapeno that?

785
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,579
Oh, take one of those jalapenos, jalapenos, jalapenos.

786
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:06,710
Oh, fuck. It's all right.

787
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:14,229
You slightly did that. All right.

788
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,260
I don't want to turn this on because this is going to bring the city back to normal.

789
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:25,699
So let's go this way.

790
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:28,819
You walk through the ruins of the buildings that spread across the floor of the valley.

791
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,829
One seems to be a large warehouse,

792
01:12:31,829 --> 01:12:35,310
though whatever was stored here has been taken by the winds long ago.

793
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,199
Keep exploring.

794
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,680
You pick your way over a low wall and through the shattered outline of a family home.

795
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:48,789
A vague depression in one corner indicates an old fire pit.

796
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:54,180
Take a look.

797
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,659
You scratch in the dirt of the fire pit for a time,

798
01:12:56,659 --> 01:12:58,899
but find nothing beyond a few shards of broken pottery.

799
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:02,659
You leave the old house by what was once the doorway.

800
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:07,220
Scratched on the doorstep is a chiseled mark, perhaps a drawing of some kind.

801
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:12,699
You squat to examine the marks.

802
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:16,979
They were perhaps once more detailed and are almost worn away by the scoring dust.

803
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:22,899
A cat, large and striped, is curled up into a ring for warmth.

804
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:44,909
I mean, we could do the classic fireball warmth, right?

805
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:48,500
Maybe I could throw a fireball into the.

806
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,180
That makes sense.

807
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:56,899
It's a lot of stamina, but it makes sense to me.

808
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,899
I always save passage, but I don't think that'll help us, really.

809
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:05,569
You only have one stamina left if you do that.

810
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:13,670
Do I, though? Oh, my crutch is gone.

811
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:16,430
I can't use this anymore.

812
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:20,319
I've been using this as like such a crutch.

813
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:22,359
The ape is far from you now.

814
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:24,560
Oh, because I prayed like 20 minutes ago.

815
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,420
I don't have any. I don't have any.

816
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:33,579
Wait, do I have any healing potions?

817
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,460
Did I drink them all a full game ago?

818
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,119
There was one point where I had like five healing potions.

819
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:53,039
Did I really drink them all?

820
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:56,779
I have no food either.

821
01:14:56,779 --> 01:15:04,510
Really? You lost them in the water.

822
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:09,989
Oh, before, yeah.

823
01:15:09,989 --> 01:15:11,909
You're starving. I know.

824
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:13,909
But welcome to sorcery.

825
01:15:15,789 --> 01:15:19,930
There's not a McDonald's anywhere.

826
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:28,539
Um, a large cat is curled up into a ring for warmth.

827
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:30,579
It's definitely hot.

828
01:15:30,579 --> 01:15:32,180
I'm doing it. I'll have one stamina, Andy.

829
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:37,560
That's fine. That was pretty lazy, Andy.

830
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,359
Yeah, I don't. Why did I even say that?

831
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:51,340
That was very lazy. Fireball.

832
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:55,140
Looking to the stars, you craft the magic, creating a ball of flame between your hands.

833
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:58,979
The firelight gleams and flickers on the old stone walls,

834
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,779
showing up the deep crevices and scoured stones.

835
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,619
Every wall looks as though it was scraped by long clawed nails.

836
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:14,140
The firelight also gleams off something green, trapped in a crack of stone, investigated.

837
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,100
You go closer, perhaps pushing away the dirt with your fingertips.

838
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,560
Perhaps was not there, but whatever.

839
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,239
To uncover a gold jewel, jammed between two stones.

840
01:16:28,739 --> 01:16:31,140
Perhaps this is where perhaps was.

841
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,340
And I put it up in the other sentence for some reason.

842
01:16:34,979 --> 01:16:38,539
Perhaps it fell here, or perhaps someone wished to hide it.

843
01:16:38,539 --> 01:16:41,260
Perhaps happens more than once in the second sentence.

844
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,060
My brain decided to. That was weird.

845
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,340
OK, let me read this again.

846
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,260
So there's people that are probably audio only right now that are like,

847
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,619
what the fuck did he just say?

848
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:54,779
You go closer, pushing away the dirt with your fingertips.

849
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,460
To uncover a gold jewel, jammed between two stones.

850
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:02,470
Perhaps it fell here, or perhaps someone wished to hide it.

851
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:08,770
Let's dig it out.

852
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:11,329
You set to work with your fingertips to dig the treasure free.

853
01:17:11,489 --> 01:17:13,960
It's tiresome work, but eventually it comes loose.

854
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,100
You cannot quite believe your eyes.

855
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:22,180
The jewel is an ingot of solid, smoothly worked gold.

856
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:26,430
It is likely to be both valuable and useful in spellcasting.

857
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:29,319
A clever find indeed.

858
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:31,720
The fireball finally gutters and goes out with a pop.

859
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:34,439
You move away from the building with the carved step.

860
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,020
Another night begins and you are suffering badly.

861
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:42,260
You need to rest, especially after going all day without food.

862
01:17:48,979 --> 01:17:55,319
Uh, I actually might be soft locked

863
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:06,680
because I need to sleep if I get hurt by anything.

864
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:10,000
I have to rewind to here, but that's not true.

865
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,239
I would need to rewind before I casted the spell, maybe even back to the giant.

866
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,699
Do the beacons heal you?

867
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:20,739
Um, I don't think they do, but it's a safe place to rest.

868
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:23,359
Usually, let's just go.

869
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:28,539
Tower will give you stamina, does it?

870
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:30,340
But all the towers aren't the same.

871
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:34,329
There might be something in here that hurts me.

872
01:18:34,329 --> 01:18:37,369
You follow the line of a broken street until you reach the base of the tower.

873
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:41,579
Somehow, amidst all the leveled buildings, its walls stand firm.

874
01:18:43,829 --> 01:18:46,109
Yeah, sometimes there's like animals in here.

875
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:53,920
The door opens easily.

876
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,119
The inside of the tower is much like the others you've seen,

877
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,159
except that perhaps it was once decorated.

878
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,760
The walls are hung with rotten strings and are set with empty candle brackets.

879
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,239
I'm going to sleep here.

880
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:09,199
You settle down in the quiet of the tower.

881
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:13,600
You've eaten nothing today, but your pack is empty and you cannot ease your hunger.

882
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:18,880
You're going to die to a rat?

883
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,970
Close my eyes.

884
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:23,369
You lie back and try to forget your troubles.

885
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:26,430
You are unharmed here and you do not dream.

886
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:32,619
You lost considerable stamina,

887
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:35,340
reached Lake Ikalala, explored the city of Timpang,

888
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,460
and you collected the Sun Serpent and the Earth Serpent,

889
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,380
meaning there are three serpents still out there.

890
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,579
You could go up to the tower or back out to the street.

891
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:57,340
All right, another beacon.

892
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:00,060
This tower also has a brass cylinder set into its center,

893
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,630
with a glowing crystal at its heart.

894
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,869
From here, the plan of the old city is quite clear,

895
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,119
winding streets and blocks leading towards and then up the cliff face.

896
01:20:09,869 --> 01:20:11,909
Though it has all been scrubbed clear,

897
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:14,670
the stain of human habitation still remains.

898
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:18,380
Activate the beacon.

899
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,939
You activate the beacon and it sweeps into life.

900
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:25,850
Adjust beam.

901
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:30,340
So we could bring this town to the past and see what's going on here.

902
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,890
I think that's a good place for it.

903
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,800
We could also go to the road.

904
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,890
There's this area here.

905
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:44,289
Unfortunately, the serpent is the serpents not here in the past.

906
01:20:44,949 --> 01:20:48,260
There is a town by food in the town.

907
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,529
That's priority number one. Yeah.

908
01:20:50,529 --> 01:20:58,569
Let me make sure I get the whole thing, though, because that looks like

909
01:20:58,729 --> 01:21:04,300
all of it. This is Tin Pang in the past.

910
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:08,840
Looks pretty good.

911
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:12,220
This is some elaborate shit. Whoa.

912
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,979
Yeah. I don't know how many of you really I know.

913
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:16,020
I know we meme a lot on this channel and we fuck around a lot.

914
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:23,149
But if you have not experienced this before, you should plant

915
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:26,109
a couple of sunflowers and get source for episode one.

916
01:21:27,699 --> 01:21:28,779
It's really, really fun.

917
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:35,859
It's a really, like, nice time.

918
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,119
He's giving us homework.

919
01:21:40,119 --> 01:21:42,520
You ever read the actual books?

920
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,399
No, I never read the books.

921
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:49,489
The books, I probably will just buy them for collection purposes.

922
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:58,149
The books were pretty elaborate.

923
01:21:58,149 --> 01:22:01,130
The books could not hold his attention.

924
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:01,930
Well, here's the thing.

925
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:07,899
So the books were copied and translated into this digital version.

926
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:12,550
So from my understanding, it's almost it's almost one to one.

927
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:17,600
The whole entire book series.

928
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,880
If I were to get the books, I would probably want to buy them

929
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:22,880
just for collecting purposes.

930
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,899
The fourth one is different.

931
01:22:27,899 --> 01:22:28,779
Books are pretty elaborate.

932
01:22:28,779 --> 01:22:31,020
Streamer can't consume on what you mean.

933
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:34,829
Books three and four are different.

934
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,310
Is there combat in the books?

935
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:39,130
Yeah, you have to roll dice.

936
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,529
I think you actually have to have a pen and paper and keep track

937
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:45,619
of everything that you're doing.

938
01:22:45,619 --> 01:22:48,039
Fourth game is the worst part.

939
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,880
Yeah, I mean, we can address the elephant in the room.

940
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:55,229
Fourth book, fourth game is kind of a mess.

941
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,680
It's still wonderful.

942
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,439
It's kind of a mess, though.

943
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:07,000
Game and book four are like kind of unbearable in some regards.

944
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:13,859
And I don't tell people that don't know why don't nobody say anything

945
01:23:13,859 --> 01:23:16,260
because it's actually like a pretty major plot.

946
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,729
It's pretty spoilery as to why that is.

947
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,100
It's it's it's kind of awful in some ways.

948
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:30,489
But OK, no spoilers.

949
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:37,739
Anyways, can you please play Goosebumps Horrorland for the Wii on?

950
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,020
I think he said Halloween.

951
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:41,859
Well, I don't know what I'm going to do.

952
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:44,899
I know I'm going to be dressed up as like fucking Count Dracula, though.

953
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:56,199
That is actually happening.

954
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:57,319
Holy shit, please.

955
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:00,159
Yeah, I'm doing I'm going to be Count Dracula for Halloween this year.

956
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,880
You butchered your playthrough of book four.

957
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,409
It's easy to do, though.

958
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:08,569
I think it's really easy to butcher the fourth.

959
01:24:15,869 --> 01:24:19,609
Anyways, let's touch the blue crystal because oh, no, there we go.

960
01:24:19,609 --> 01:24:21,770
Yeah, I'm good.

961
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,810
You feel better for having touched the cylinder.

962
01:24:25,069 --> 01:24:27,750
Look at the view. Let's just take a look.

963
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:31,590
Looking out across the city, it seems you can see two time periods at once,

964
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:34,460
one fitting on top of the other.

965
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,100
But it's impossible to tell which is true and which is the mask.

966
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,600
You watch a child running down a street only to turn the corner and disappear.

967
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,600
You watch a dog spring into existence mid-leap.

968
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:47,840
A building throws yellow smoke into the air.

969
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,689
But when the smoke clears, the building is ruined and broken.

970
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:56,279
You cannot tear your eyes away.

971
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:58,880
Every time the streets clear or a building falls,

972
01:24:59,319 --> 01:25:01,880
you feel your anger towards the Archmage rising.

973
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:04,880
The desolation here is complete.

974
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,250
The people you see are both still living and already long destroyed.

975
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:17,369
Go investigate a major city, Timpang.

976
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,680
Omega, Lul, Omega, Omega, Lul.

977
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:36,010
I don't know why I read that one.

978
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:38,050
Are you OK? I'm reading chat.

979
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,250
Half the time when I just say a random sentence, I'm just looking over here

980
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,899
and just parroting something that somebody wrote.

981
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,939
You head off into the city once more.

982
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:51,979
The sky is blue and pink.

983
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:54,260
The streets are suddenly alive with activity.

984
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:56,859
People roam the streets calling to one another and talking.

985
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,619
Musicians stand on street corners playing lively jigs to passerby's.

986
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:03,710
A nearby building pumps yellow tinge smoke into the air.

987
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:07,439
You make your way along the busy bustling streets, marveling at all the people.

988
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:17,750
They do not realize that they are ghosts, ghosts, quests, thoughts.

989
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:20,560
Mm, that one's fine.

990
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,250
Ghosts, thoughts, quests.

991
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:26,000
Eh, it's all right.

992
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,920
Their faces express the usual range of thoughts and feelings.

993
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,890
Happiness, fear, anxiety, humor.

994
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,250
They do not seem to realize they are no better than ghosts.

995
01:26:34,909 --> 01:26:39,789
That once the light from the tower is moved away, they will be long dead once more.

996
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:52,069
Whoa, I have to turn it this way to see this.

997
01:26:56,909 --> 01:27:03,460
First things first, let's go.

998
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,930
Should I go to the smoking building first or should we explore over here?

999
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:15,270
The choices matter in this game. Yes, they do.

1000
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:20,579
Let's go to the high city.

1001
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:24,569
I'll turn it a little bit when I go back.

1002
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:26,130
You follow the winding climbing

1003
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:28,649
stepped streets into the upper reaches of the city.

1004
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,739
Low hovels and clustered dwellings are replaced by larger buildings,

1005
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,619
mansions, palaces and central offices.

1006
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:38,060
You pass a familiar building

1007
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:42,340
daubed in red paint with two doors. Look at the building.

1008
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:46,380
Above one door is a sign with a picture of a fanged tooth.

1009
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,880
But the other is a metal implement that looks like a small pair of tongs.

1010
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,819
Tooth door, tong door.

1011
01:27:55,819 --> 01:27:57,699
Tooth building. Go in the tooth building.

1012
01:27:57,699 --> 01:28:01,609
I have a lot of teeth. That's right.

1013
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:06,260
That's right. Lorag. Lorag in the chat right now.

1014
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,659
That's a name that's been around for a very long time. Lorag.

1015
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:20,600
Let's go in the tooth door.

1016
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,800
You open the door to find it leads into a wide hall,

1017
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,829
which the other door also opens into.

1018
01:28:25,829 --> 01:28:30,609
In a large chair at one end sits a man with a tight fitting leather cap.

1019
01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:34,449
On a low table at his elbow rests an array of metal implements.

1020
01:28:35,020 --> 01:28:38,380
He stands as you enter.

1021
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,060
This scared the fuck out of me.

1022
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:46,250
I thought that was him barking at me. Greetings.

1023
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:50,069
Are you here to buy or sell?

1024
01:28:50,069 --> 01:28:52,869
A strange question, since there appears to be nothing on sale

1025
01:28:53,739 --> 01:28:57,140
unless the goods are all behind the curtain that covers the back wall.

1026
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:01,529
What is your trade?

1027
01:29:01,529 --> 01:29:04,010
You didn't see the sign?

1028
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:07,850
Uh, you're a blacksmith.

1029
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,829
You're a dentist.

1030
01:29:09,829 --> 01:29:12,149
You are a supplier of magical artifacts.

1031
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,250
Oh, it's a dentist. You're a dentist.

1032
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,180
He winces. That is a nasty word for it.

1033
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,500
It is as though I called you a conjurer.

1034
01:29:26,579 --> 01:29:29,020
He shuffles a few documents on a low table by his arm.

1035
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:33,090
But do I take it then you are simply not in the market for teeth?

1036
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,529
I have teeth. I have enough teeth.

1037
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,020
Cheath? What kinds of teeth?

1038
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:47,199
I have teeth to sell.

1039
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:49,500
He leans forward.

1040
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,159
Your own teeth?

1041
01:29:51,159 --> 01:29:54,520
Well, those of others.

1042
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,500
You would buy my teeth.

1043
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,819
I have creatures teeth.

1044
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:05,880
A dentist that sells teeth. That's rad.

1045
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:08,560
Sell your teeth.

1046
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,250
I feel like we did this before.

1047
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:17,659
I think the chat was identical like seven or eight years ago, whatever it is now.

1048
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,880
I feel like the chat was identical.

1049
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,579
Sell your teeth.

1050
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:32,000
So we just do it again.

1051
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,220
What's the worst that could happen?

1052
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:36,979
Let's do it. It's whatever.

1053
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:39,789
You would buy my teeth.

1054
01:30:39,789 --> 01:30:41,149
Indeed, I would.

1055
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,609
The man peers closely at you and then nods.

1056
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:51,420
One of your molars, perhaps a molar from good stock is always a precious commodity.

1057
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:55,600
What is a molar?

1058
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,220
I am no kind of stock.

1059
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:59,939
My teeth are not for sale.

1060
01:30:59,939 --> 01:31:01,779
How much for a molar?

1061
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:03,500
What is a molar?

1062
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,779
You ask appalled.

1063
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:07,260
Oh, my apologies.

1064
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:09,060
I took you for a sorcerer.

1065
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:14,380
Teeth are valuable, indeed indispensable, component of what we call summoning spells.

1066
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:18,939
So a giant's tooth may summon a giant and a snatacat tooth may summon a snatacat.

1067
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:23,100
A human molar in good condition can be used to summon a subservient human,

1068
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:28,229
which, as I'm sure you can imagine, has tremendous uses.

1069
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:32,430
What is the spell for summoning a human?

1070
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:33,550
You demand.

1071
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:36,819
This is no magic you have heard of previously.

1072
01:31:36,819 --> 01:31:42,739
If your masters didn't teach it to you, then I think it's best that you don't know.

1073
01:31:42,739 --> 01:31:47,729
Besides, I merely sell the teeth.

1074
01:31:47,729 --> 01:31:50,710
How much for a molar?

1075
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,350
For one of yours?

1076
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:55,369
Oh, I would pay 30 gold pieces at least.

1077
01:31:55,369 --> 01:31:57,140
You're strong and intelligent.

1078
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,949
I can see that much from the curve of your incisors.

1079
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:02,029
Would that seem fair to you?

1080
01:32:02,029 --> 01:32:06,930
30 gold pieces? Holy, holy moly!

1081
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:15,750
That's not enough.

1082
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:22,939
Should I try to get more money?

1083
01:32:22,939 --> 01:32:23,939
Should we haggle for more?

1084
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:26,460
Let's haggle. That's not enough.

1085
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,220
Hmm.

1086
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:33,779
Perhaps I can go as high as 35, especially if the root is in good condition.

1087
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:38,329
A long root means the spell will last longer, you understand?

1088
01:32:38,329 --> 01:32:41,220
I don't like this.

1089
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:46,300
I don't like this.

1090
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,949
I don't know.

1091
01:32:50,949 --> 01:32:53,390
No deal? No deal?

1092
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:58,029
My teeth are not for sale?

1093
01:32:58,029 --> 01:32:59,640
I'll leave it up to you guys.

1094
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,239
Because I think we've done this before, but I don't really remember.

1095
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:03,760
It was like seven years ago.

1096
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,380
But what do you think?

1097
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,979
Should we sell teeth?

1098
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:13,489
35 gold is a lot of money.

1099
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:19,770
But I forget what the potential consequences of this are.

1100
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:25,560
What do you think? Should we get a pull-up?

1101
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:29,100
Sell teeth or not?

1102
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:38,399
35 is a lot.

1103
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:39,560
I love the no.

1104
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:40,399
No.

1105
01:33:40,399 --> 01:33:43,560
The one guy in chat doing the no.

1106
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:50,260
Don't do it.

1107
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:59,029
50-50? Well, we'll see.

1108
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:01,479
Sell somebody else's teeth.

1109
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:05,689
Well, I took a human tooth, didn't I?

1110
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:06,409
Sell that too.

1111
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:14,359
I'm going to have like 200 bucks after this.

1112
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:24,619
I'm going to be able to buy an entire platter of food.

1113
01:34:24,619 --> 01:34:26,649
All right, what are we doing?

1114
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:28,960
Not sell.

1115
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,939
Not sell.

1116
01:34:30,939 --> 01:34:32,699
Wow.

1117
01:34:32,699 --> 01:34:33,539
Wow.

1118
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:34,979
Okay.

1119
01:34:34,979 --> 01:34:40,229
It was by four votes.

1120
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:41,609
Wow.

1121
01:34:41,609 --> 01:34:46,060
See, don't ever tell me that your vote doesn't count here.

1122
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:52,420
If only four or five more of you voted the other way.

1123
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:53,260
Mm-hmm.

1124
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,359
Okay.

1125
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:59,029
My teeth are not for sale.

1126
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:00,109
Very well.

1127
01:35:00,109 --> 01:35:05,689
Do you have anything else to interest me?

1128
01:35:05,689 --> 01:35:08,729
I have creatures' teeth to sell.

1129
01:35:08,729 --> 01:35:11,670
And from what creature?

1130
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,630
An ape.

1131
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:14,220
A human.

1132
01:35:14,220 --> 01:35:17,449
You pull out the tooth, but the salesman shakes his head.

1133
01:35:17,449 --> 01:35:18,930
My apologies.

1134
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:20,369
I cannot buy teeth from humans

1135
01:35:20,369 --> 01:35:22,609
without knowing their stock and character.

1136
01:35:22,609 --> 01:35:26,819
Humans in the wild are simply too unreliable.

1137
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:29,670
Anything else?

1138
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:33,539
Snattercats.

1139
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:34,899
His eyes light up.

1140
01:35:34,899 --> 01:35:36,979
Oh, a most useful tooth indeed.

1141
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:38,899
And very hard to come by.

1142
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,340
I will give you eight gold pieces per tooth.

1143
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:45,050
I hope that is acceptable.

1144
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:47,170
That is too little.

1145
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:48,369
10 then.

1146
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:53,609
But I cannot go higher.

1147
01:35:53,609 --> 01:35:57,489
How many Snattercat teeth do I have?

1148
01:35:57,489 --> 01:36:11,420
Can I use them for anything else?

1149
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:16,960
Other items?

1150
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,260
I have seven Snattercat teeth.

1151
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,220
Oh my God.

1152
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:21,060
Okay.

1153
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,989
Yeah, well we're gonna sell all of them.

1154
01:36:22,989 --> 01:36:24,909
I'll keep one.

1155
01:36:24,909 --> 01:36:27,979
All right, sell three.

1156
01:36:27,979 --> 01:36:30,500
Boom, 50.

1157
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,260
You take out three teeth and hand them over.

1158
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,300
The merchant whistles for a lackey

1159
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,899
who takes them into a back room

1160
01:36:35,899 --> 01:36:38,390
and returns with 30 gold pieces.

1161
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:40,819
No more?

1162
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:42,899
What about ape?

1163
01:36:42,899 --> 01:36:43,859
Ape teeth?

1164
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:48,350
Well now, very few people want an ape tooth,

1165
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:51,069
but those that do are quite obsessed with them.

1166
01:36:51,069 --> 01:36:53,869
I believe that they use them for cat burglary,

1167
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:55,390
but I am not sure.

1168
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,710
I will give you 15 gold pieces for each one,

1169
01:36:57,710 --> 01:36:59,869
or 60 for three.

1170
01:36:59,869 --> 01:37:03,319
What?

1171
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:06,539
How many do I have of those?

1172
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:07,739
I'm gonna have like a hundred and,

1173
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:12,960
I'm gonna have $110.

1174
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,569
Sell them all.

1175
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:20,779
Holy shit.

1176
01:37:20,779 --> 01:37:21,619
No more?

1177
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:22,539
All right, I'm keeping the,

1178
01:37:22,539 --> 01:37:26,170
cause these actually have uses and spells.

1179
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,779
Sell no more.

1180
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:29,489
You close your pack.

1181
01:37:29,489 --> 01:37:32,489
I have nothing more to offer you.

1182
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:34,489
You open your arms to raise a spell,

1183
01:37:35,289 --> 01:37:36,289
but the merchant catches your arm.

1184
01:37:36,289 --> 01:37:37,970
Try if you must,

1185
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:41,460
but we have a mini mite chained up in the back room.

1186
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,340
We don't want people testing out the merchandise

1187
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:46,460
in the shop, you understand.

1188
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:52,060
By the way, if you don't know what a mini mite is,

1189
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:55,029
a mini mite is a little fairy-like creature

1190
01:37:55,029 --> 01:37:56,750
that if they are in the vicinity,

1191
01:37:56,750 --> 01:38:00,680
magic cannot be used within the vicinity.

1192
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,560
Those of you that have no idea what,

1193
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,159
what it's being referred to here.

1194
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,100
Perhaps I will buy.

1195
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,619
Very wise.

1196
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:11,619
I have a few rarities in my possession today.

1197
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:15,760
A genuine Firefox tooth and my prized possession.

1198
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,979
The root of a rock demon.

1199
01:38:19,979 --> 01:38:23,300
How much for the Firefox?

1200
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:25,060
You can take it from me.

1201
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,979
Just five gold pieces.

1202
01:38:27,979 --> 01:38:31,300
What good is a Firefox tooth?

1203
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,699
Curious beast, the Firefox.

1204
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:37,020
It contains the elemental nature of fire within itself.

1205
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,819
The teeth can be broken to ignite a small flame.

1206
01:38:39,819 --> 01:38:40,819
Let me demonstrate.

1207
01:38:41,979 --> 01:38:45,229
Breaking an imaginary fang with between his hands.

1208
01:38:45,229 --> 01:38:52,489
Are you interested?

1209
01:38:52,489 --> 01:38:54,090
This voice laughing my ass off.

1210
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,899
What?

1211
01:38:56,899 --> 01:38:58,689
Are you getting scammed?

1212
01:38:58,689 --> 01:38:59,810
It's only five gold.

1213
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,020
Look, look how much money I have.

1214
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:04,020
It's just five, I'm getting it.

1215
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:06,829
You hand over five gold pieces and receive one tooth.

1216
01:39:06,829 --> 01:39:12,619
How much for the rock demon?

1217
01:39:12,619 --> 01:39:15,539
You are a man of taste, I see.

1218
01:39:15,539 --> 01:39:16,840
Zequicks!

1219
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,880
He snaps his fingers and a stooped figure appears

1220
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:22,039
from the back carrying an enormous crystal rock.

1221
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:25,449
It is clearly extremely heavy.

1222
01:39:25,449 --> 01:39:27,699
In perfect condition, as you see.

1223
01:39:27,699 --> 01:39:29,579
Virtually flawless.

1224
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:37,800
Yours for a mere 32 gold pieces.

1225
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,140
You look it over.

1226
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:41,930
The two shape is indistinct.

1227
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:45,079
Ridges and whirls in a crystal cube.

1228
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:52,060
But the sense of magic surrounding it is palpable.

1229
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:53,619
I don't need this.

1230
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:54,939
Yeah, too heavy.

1231
01:39:54,939 --> 01:39:56,289
Yeah, too much.

1232
01:39:56,289 --> 01:39:59,109
That's too much.

1233
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:01,250
That is too much.

1234
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:04,520
Too much is the price my servant paid in getting it.

1235
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,739
You will have to believe me on that.

1236
01:40:06,739 --> 01:40:08,819
As the poor woman is no longer here

1237
01:40:08,819 --> 01:40:12,140
to demonstrate her injuries.

1238
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:13,300
Oh, she's dead.

1239
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:19,340
Okay.

1240
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,920
I don't want it.

1241
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,579
You wave the servant away once more.

1242
01:40:23,619 --> 01:40:25,819
You close your pack and your money pouch.

1243
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:27,479
He nods and smiles.

1244
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:31,279
Buy a previously considered tooth.

1245
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,180
You're rich, get it.

1246
01:40:34,180 --> 01:40:36,539
Yeah, I want to keep my wealth.

1247
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:39,100
I don't want to just blow it on a big rock.

1248
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:42,449
I don't know what it does.

1249
01:40:42,449 --> 01:40:44,649
Get him to bring it in again.

1250
01:40:44,649 --> 01:40:49,659
Hey, can I see that rock tooth, the rock one again?

1251
01:40:49,659 --> 01:40:50,979
Perhaps that will change my mind

1252
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:53,729
on one of the other teeth after all.

1253
01:40:53,729 --> 01:40:54,810
What would you like?

1254
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:56,010
Hey, can I see the rock?

1255
01:40:56,010 --> 01:40:56,850
No, no, no, no.

1256
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:01,159
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1257
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:04,460
Buy all my teeth back.

1258
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:06,460
All right, buy all my teeth back.

1259
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,159
Sell them, buy them all again

1260
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:14,180
and try to get out on top, right?

1261
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,479
I'm done.

1262
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:17,479
You peruse the stock once more,

1263
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:19,260
but do not find anything to buy.

1264
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:20,899
There is nothing more to do here.

1265
01:41:20,899 --> 01:41:23,779
With a final nod to the man, you return to the street.

1266
01:41:23,779 --> 01:41:25,470
You move along.

1267
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:29,220
The streets are quieter here with few passersby,

1268
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:30,979
but there are still no guards, no soldiers,

1269
01:41:30,979 --> 01:41:33,189
no priests, no children playing.

1270
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:35,750
As though the whole city is purely a place

1271
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:42,220
of workers and foremen, a mining town perhaps.

1272
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:46,960
Let's head out to the main square.

1273
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,819
You stop in a plaza.

1274
01:41:48,819 --> 01:41:51,180
A woman passes by wearing a wrapped head scarf

1275
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:55,359
and carrying what looks like a basket of rocks.

1276
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:56,199
Greetings.

1277
01:41:56,199 --> 01:41:58,560
Where are you going?

1278
01:41:58,560 --> 01:41:59,399
Greetings.

1279
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:02,119
I am new in this city.

1280
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:04,340
And you are welcome, I'm sure.

1281
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:05,739
She seems in a hurry to move on.

1282
01:42:05,739 --> 01:42:10,350
No doubt her basket is heavy.

1283
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:12,199
Can I carry that for you?

1284
01:42:12,199 --> 01:42:14,050
What is the name of this city?

1285
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:16,090
What do you know of the Sethan Serpents?

1286
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:18,399
How can I cross the lake?

1287
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,100
Can I carry that for you?

1288
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,500
Most absolutely not.

1289
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,060
I would not be doing my walk if I gave it away.

1290
01:42:28,060 --> 01:42:29,500
She takes a wary step backwards,

1291
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:33,260
almost stumbling under her weight.

1292
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,680
And where do you work?

1293
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:39,220
But of course, I would not tell anyone.

1294
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:41,739
And where is it that you work?

1295
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:43,579
At the warehouse, of course.

1296
01:42:43,579 --> 01:42:45,380
She waves her with her nose at the building

1297
01:42:45,380 --> 01:42:48,130
with the yellow smoke.

1298
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:50,989
A warehouse of rocks?

1299
01:42:50,989 --> 01:42:52,109
For now?

1300
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:53,149
Yeah.

1301
01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:54,430
Forgive me.

1302
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,409
Well, I must do my work.

1303
01:42:56,409 --> 01:42:59,850
With that, she scurries away down the street and disappears.

1304
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:02,039
Hmm, oh, interesting.

1305
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:13,310
All right, I wanna, we're gonna turn this this way.

1306
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:14,310
We're gonna turn it this way

1307
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:17,529
and then we're gonna turn it this way.

1308
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:18,409
Should I check the road first?

1309
01:43:18,409 --> 01:43:19,489
Let me just check the road.

1310
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:23,960
Might be something right here in front of the gate.

1311
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,239
You leave the city by the old road.

1312
01:43:25,239 --> 01:43:27,720
As the sun climbs towards its zenith, the wind picks up.

1313
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:31,340
The road passes under a large stone arch.

1314
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,100
Look at the pillars.

1315
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,140
The pillars you saw earlier

1316
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:37,609
have built themselves up into an arch,

1317
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:38,449
which spans the road,

1318
01:43:38,449 --> 01:43:40,699
casting a deep shadow as you walk through.

1319
01:43:40,699 --> 01:43:43,739
Carved into the lintel stones in the old hand

1320
01:43:43,739 --> 01:43:50,939
are two pictograms, pictograms.

1321
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:52,619
The first symbol is for metal.

1322
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:54,710
The second is for pain.

1323
01:43:54,710 --> 01:43:57,989
This, it proclaims, is the city of Tinpang,

1324
01:43:57,989 --> 01:44:03,119
city of miners, interesting.

1325
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,899
All right, so we're gonna go back and do this

1326
01:44:04,899 --> 01:44:08,340
because I wanna see what happens here.

1327
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:13,529
I don't have any food, yeah.

1328
01:44:13,529 --> 01:44:19,579
Yeah, let's turn this over.

1329
01:44:19,579 --> 01:44:29,489
Mm-hmm, all the way up.

1330
01:44:29,489 --> 01:44:36,439
Buy some goddamn food that I can, I'm trying.

1331
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:47,590
All right, let's go that way in the right spot.

1332
01:44:47,590 --> 01:44:52,579
Oregon trail families are more well-fed than your rich ass.

1333
01:44:52,579 --> 01:44:57,409
Guys, I became rich five minutes ago.

1334
01:44:57,409 --> 01:45:00,010
I would love to spend my money somewhere.

1335
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:06,170
I became wealthy four and a half minutes ago.

1336
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:13,000
All right, let's go check out the building.

1337
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,159
As the light around you changes,

1338
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,199
you seem to lose track of where you are.

1339
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:18,800
Streets grow firmer as you walk them.

1340
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,600
Walls fill with stone.

1341
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:23,739
Suddenly, there are people on all sides.

1342
01:45:23,739 --> 01:45:25,739
You approach the smoking building.

1343
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:29,140
From inside, there comes a cacophony of sounds.

1344
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:31,380
You didn't think I was gonna say that word right.

1345
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:34,300
Crashing and booming as though a rock demon was inside

1346
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:39,119
fighting against its chains.

1347
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,920
Keep listening.

1348
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,529
You continue to listen,

1349
01:45:43,529 --> 01:45:44,850
making out the sound of hammering

1350
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:47,170
and grinding above the echoes.

1351
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:50,409
This building must extend backwards into the mountainside

1352
01:45:50,409 --> 01:45:52,970
and be an enormous cavern of activity.

1353
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:54,600
Perhaps it's a mine.

1354
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,300
You turn about as a small boy grabs your arm.

1355
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:01,510
Are you supposed to be inside?

1356
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,119
Get off me.

1357
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,560
Yes, no, or shake him off.

1358
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:13,539
Yes, you lie.

1359
01:46:13,539 --> 01:46:15,380
I thought so.

1360
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,859
You're the overseer from Man Pang.

1361
01:46:17,859 --> 01:46:20,060
You can always tell a sorcerer.

1362
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:22,020
Your eyes are rotten.

1363
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:23,930
Follow me.

1364
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:25,890
This boy talks well above his age

1365
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:28,100
and acts that way as well.

1366
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:31,670
He throws open the door and beckons to you.

1367
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,520
I guess I'm where I'm supposed to be.

1368
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,760
Follow him inside.

1369
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:41,720
You step inside the hot, smoky interior in the factory.

1370
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,000
The inside of the factory is filled

1371
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,300
with a smoky yellow haze.

1372
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,939
About 100 people are working away at work benches.

1373
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:53,420
The sound of hammer strikes echo around the chamber.

1374
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,000
What are they all doing?

1375
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,210
You ask.

1376
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:58,250
The boy frowns at you.

1377
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:03,039
How did you suppose the powder was extracted from the stone?

1378
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:07,260
Each rock must be crushed and the spore is extracted.

1379
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,029
Then it is processed.

1380
01:47:09,029 --> 01:47:12,520
And he indicates a large contraption in the far corner.

1381
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:15,720
It is from here the yellow smoke is belching.

1382
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,000
You look away for a moment.

1383
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,449
And when you look back, the boy is vanished.

1384
01:47:22,449 --> 01:47:24,489
Otto, each rock must be crushed.

1385
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:32,159
All right, let's talk to a worker.

1386
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:35,159
Greetings, you declare.

1387
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,520
The creature promptly vanishes

1388
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,640
and reappears at another bench in the shop.

1389
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:42,359
One of the adults tries to ease you aside.

1390
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:48,920
The boy rushes over to scold him and he mumbles an apology.

1391
01:47:52,069 --> 01:47:54,130
Look at the bench.

1392
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:56,050
You look over one of the benches.

1393
01:47:56,050 --> 01:47:59,880
It is piled high with chunks of stone.

1394
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,319
A few of the workers sort them

1395
01:48:01,319 --> 01:48:04,220
by some criteria you cannot guess.

1396
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,500
Those they select are slid across the bench to a hammerer.

1397
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:11,390
The rejected rock seemed to simply disappear.

1398
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:14,520
Watch the disappearing rocks.

1399
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,119
In fact, it is not the rock which disappears,

1400
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,850
but the worker doing the sorting as well.

1401
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:23,289
They seem to flicker, reappearing a heartbeat later

1402
01:48:23,289 --> 01:48:27,180
with empty arms, a fresh stone.

1403
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,520
The boy reappears at your side.

1404
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,229
Please, you are distracting the workers.

1405
01:48:33,229 --> 01:48:37,439
He moves you towards the door.

1406
01:48:37,479 --> 01:48:39,930
Give me some of that powder.

1407
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,880
Give me some of the powder, you declare.

1408
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,449
Of course, the boy nods, vanishes,

1409
01:48:45,449 --> 01:48:48,210
and reappears instantly with a small vial of yellow dust

1410
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:49,850
which he hands you.

1411
01:48:49,850 --> 01:48:52,250
Then he indicates the door and you've stepped through.

1412
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:54,149
You have seen enough.

1413
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:57,159
Yellow powder.

1414
01:48:57,159 --> 01:49:01,739
What does that do?

1415
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:02,979
Is it for the smell?

1416
01:49:02,979 --> 01:49:17,020
Stench, right?

1417
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:22,039
Yellow powder.

1418
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:24,140
I passed it already?

1419
01:49:24,140 --> 01:49:26,710
Oh, yeah, there it is.

1420
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:27,949
So it's speed.

1421
01:49:27,949 --> 01:49:31,739
Ooh.

1422
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:36,310
Okay, the caster must cast the spell on his or her own body.

1423
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:38,310
The caster will then become exceedingly quick

1424
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:41,189
and may run, speak, or think, or fight

1425
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:44,039
at three times normal speed.

1426
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:46,439
Speak or think.

1427
01:49:46,439 --> 01:49:47,930
That's funny.

1428
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:49,689
However, this spell requires the caster

1429
01:49:49,689 --> 01:49:52,409
to sniff yellow powder before casting.

1430
01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:53,880
It's just drugs.

1431
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:55,319
It's literally, it's catnip.

1432
01:49:57,939 --> 01:49:59,659
It's just like cocaine.

1433
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:01,420
It's piss coke.

1434
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:03,409
Yeah.

1435
01:50:03,409 --> 01:50:08,170
Yellow cocaine.

1436
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,380
That's funny.

1437
01:50:09,380 --> 01:50:12,500
All right, well, sure it has a use.

1438
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,600
Outside.

1439
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:16,819
You step back onto the street.

1440
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:18,920
Look back.

1441
01:50:18,920 --> 01:50:20,960
Looking back, you notice for the first time

1442
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:23,760
the roof of the warehouse, sloping,

1443
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,239
but with several wooden beams that lean outwards,

1444
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:28,840
like open arms lifting to the sky.

1445
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:30,310
You gasp.

1446
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:33,550
The whole building appears to be a grimelkin,

1447
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:35,949
like those you saw as an apprentice.

1448
01:50:35,949 --> 01:50:38,430
Magical constructions which gather magic

1449
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:41,250
the way a funnel gathers rainwater.

1450
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,760
Surely not.

1451
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:44,960
No one would construct a grimelkin on such a scale.

1452
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,770
It seems impossible.

1453
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:50,489
Lost in thought, you wander the streets.

1454
01:50:50,489 --> 01:51:01,989
All right, let's turn it one more time down this way.

1455
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:06,520
All right, the question is, do I go this way?

1456
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,109
You'll see, Ernie.

1457
01:51:08,109 --> 01:51:12,520
So let's see if there's anything I can do here

1458
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,439
in this area.

1459
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:15,159
Probably not, but the question is,

1460
01:51:15,159 --> 01:51:20,380
do I go to the lake serpent, the water serpent,

1461
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:23,380
or should I try to go to this little town on the lake

1462
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,399
in the past and forget about the serpent

1463
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:33,439
and just try to buy something here?

1464
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:35,560
I could go back here, do this, try to buy something,

1465
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:38,069
come back and just move it.

1466
01:51:38,069 --> 01:51:39,229
Yeah, we'll do that.

1467
01:51:39,229 --> 01:51:43,859
That makes sense to me.

1468
01:51:43,859 --> 01:51:47,260
Yeah, I need food really bad, that's true.

1469
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:57,590
If somebody will sell it to me, I'll buy it.

1470
01:51:57,590 --> 01:51:59,069
Okay, let's go.

1471
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:11,279
All right, let's check out this town in the past.

1472
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:13,239
You continue to walk along the road.

1473
01:52:13,239 --> 01:52:16,279
Begin to hear the distant sound of chatter

1474
01:52:16,279 --> 01:52:18,399
and cartwheels on the stone.

1475
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:21,569
The moon gazes down impassively.

1476
01:52:21,569 --> 01:52:23,430
The road begins to bustle with people

1477
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,229
who seem to emerge through the dust and mist

1478
01:52:25,229 --> 01:52:29,939
and rumble past in their carts.

1479
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:31,560
You look at the people.

1480
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,260
Of all the strange things you have seen out in the wastes,

1481
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,189
this is the strangest.

1482
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:39,579
These people come from nowhere and go nowhere,

1483
01:52:39,619 --> 01:52:43,060
and the same travelers pass by again and again,

1484
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:46,020
waving the same greetings down to you.

1485
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:48,819
You stride on through the crowds.

1486
01:52:48,819 --> 01:52:51,310
After a few minutes, you encounter a small girl

1487
01:52:51,310 --> 01:52:56,640
sitting on her own and staring into the distance.

1488
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:57,779
Look for her parents.

1489
01:52:57,779 --> 01:53:08,060
Stop to talk to her or ignore her.

1490
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:10,039
Let's talk.

1491
01:53:10,039 --> 01:53:13,840
You go over to her and squat down on your ankles.

1492
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,029
Greetings, little girl.

1493
01:53:16,029 --> 01:53:18,979
The girl looks up at you sharply.

1494
01:53:18,979 --> 01:53:23,409
You're in the wrong place, aren't you?

1495
01:53:23,409 --> 01:53:25,529
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.

1496
01:53:25,529 --> 01:53:27,100
I am traveling.

1497
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,300
What do you mean?

1498
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:31,600
What do you mean?

1499
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,520
I can see it.

1500
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,050
No one else seems to notice, but I can see it.

1501
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:39,010
You should find your parents.

1502
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:41,050
You seem to be lost.

1503
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:44,060
What can you see?

1504
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:46,899
I think it must be a curse.

1505
01:53:46,899 --> 01:53:49,180
Adults are so forgetful.

1506
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:52,050
They forget everything.

1507
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:54,260
Where are your parents?

1508
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,260
You ask gently.

1509
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:57,779
Have they forgotten you?

1510
01:53:57,779 --> 01:53:59,880
They've been lost.

1511
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,840
I think they must have forgotten themselves.

1512
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:05,319
She points up at the road towards the great stone arch

1513
01:54:05,319 --> 01:54:07,409
at the entrance to the city.

1514
01:54:07,409 --> 01:54:09,489
When did they rebuild that?

1515
01:54:09,489 --> 01:54:11,000
She asks.

1516
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:11,840
Oh, shit.

1517
01:54:13,539 --> 01:54:15,869
Is she seeing?

1518
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:17,720
Wait a minute.

1519
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,510
This is...

1520
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:24,420
The arch has never fallen.

1521
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,000
I have seen that arch broken.

1522
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:34,939
What do we do?

1523
01:54:34,939 --> 01:54:36,899
I just say, the arch has never fallen.

1524
01:54:36,899 --> 01:54:37,739
What are you talking about?

1525
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:42,380
You didn't, there's nothing wrong.

1526
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,899
I have seen that arch broken.

1527
01:54:44,899 --> 01:54:47,199
You tell her.

1528
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:48,630
I knew it.

1529
01:54:48,630 --> 01:54:49,909
Didn't I say?

1530
01:54:49,909 --> 01:54:51,430
You're in the wrong place.

1531
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:54,409
I could tell by the way you were looking at people.

1532
01:54:54,409 --> 01:54:57,899
Are you the one that stole my parents?

1533
01:54:57,939 --> 01:55:00,189
I don't know.

1534
01:55:00,189 --> 01:55:02,250
What do you mean, I don't know?

1535
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:04,689
I don't know.

1536
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,300
I've killed tons of people.

1537
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:08,500
Lots of people have died

1538
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:12,100
and I may have accidentally harmed quite a few.

1539
01:55:12,100 --> 01:55:14,850
I don't know.

1540
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:17,060
They'll come back.

1541
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:20,199
I don't think you say they'll come back.

1542
01:55:20,199 --> 01:55:21,319
No, I didn't do anything.

1543
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:22,909
No.

1544
01:55:22,909 --> 01:55:25,949
She shakes her head and then stands abruptly hitting you.

1545
01:55:25,949 --> 01:55:27,289
Ow.

1546
01:55:27,289 --> 01:55:28,369
I think you are.

1547
01:55:28,369 --> 01:55:29,649
I can tell you are.

1548
01:55:29,649 --> 01:55:31,449
No one else can see it, but I can see it.

1549
01:55:31,449 --> 01:55:34,300
It was you and I want them back.

1550
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:36,260
With that, she rushes away and is quickly lost

1551
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:38,609
in the strange mists.

1552
01:55:38,609 --> 01:55:48,779
All is quiet once more.

1553
01:55:48,779 --> 01:55:50,420
You little shit.

1554
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:51,899
It's not a tumor.

1555
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:57,819
The road curves gently as you follow it.

1556
01:55:57,819 --> 01:55:59,659
You stride along the road.

1557
01:55:59,659 --> 01:56:03,760
Travel is hurried past in the darkness.

1558
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:10,380
All right, let's buy some food, please.

1559
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:13,439
That's a throwback.

1560
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:15,380
How long ago was that?

1561
01:56:15,380 --> 01:56:17,619
2016, 2017?

1562
01:56:17,619 --> 01:56:18,939
I don't even remember.

1563
01:56:18,939 --> 01:56:22,449
Long time ago.

1564
01:56:22,449 --> 01:56:24,210
You follow the road as it curves and bends

1565
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:25,970
and finally begins to descend until it reaches

1566
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:29,229
the shores of the lake.

1567
01:56:29,229 --> 01:56:32,819
The bay is quiet, though judging by the scattered litter,

1568
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:34,630
it has been a busy day.

1569
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:37,909
Lines of boarded up huts follow the curve of the shore

1570
01:56:37,909 --> 01:56:42,109
and heaped here and there are piles of rotting fish parts

1571
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:47,609
left over from the great feats of cooking.

1572
01:56:47,609 --> 01:56:50,319
Look through the rubbish.

1573
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:52,159
Without any thought to the smell,

1574
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,439
you dig through one of the nearby piles of fish heads,

1575
01:56:54,439 --> 01:56:58,329
scales, bones, and other body bits from the day's catches.

1576
01:56:58,329 --> 01:57:00,779
At the bottom of the heap, you find a single gold piece,

1577
01:57:00,779 --> 01:57:02,979
which hardly seems worth the smell

1578
01:57:02,979 --> 01:57:08,260
and oil that now covers your fingers.

1579
01:57:08,260 --> 01:57:10,939
Look across the water.

1580
01:57:10,939 --> 01:57:15,210
Hey, another gold.

1581
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:16,529
You walk down to the edge of the water

1582
01:57:16,529 --> 01:57:18,300
and look out southwards.

1583
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,380
The surface is almost mirror flat,

1584
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,300
the reflection of the moon broken by

1585
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:24,420
only the occasional ripple.

1586
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:26,899
Familiar stars seem to lie on the ground,

1587
01:57:26,899 --> 01:57:28,979
their patterns visible to all.

1588
01:57:28,979 --> 01:57:32,689
A few things growl in the bushes near the shoreline.

1589
01:57:32,689 --> 01:57:35,029
Look at the stars.

1590
01:57:35,029 --> 01:57:38,119
The stars on the water are laid out like a chart,

1591
01:57:38,119 --> 01:57:40,359
but a chart in reverse.

1592
01:57:40,359 --> 01:57:43,960
Looking at them like this reminds you of what Elthera said,

1593
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,170
of spells having opposites.

1594
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:48,409
In the water, constellations you recognize above

1595
01:57:48,409 --> 01:57:52,069
become others below.

1596
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:57,260
The law spell, the zap spell, or the sus spell?

1597
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:00,699
Sus backwards is sus.

1598
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:06,859
How would that reverse?

1599
01:58:06,859 --> 01:58:12,529
Doesn't that make no sense?

1600
01:58:12,529 --> 01:58:18,460
Um, law is wall?

1601
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:21,409
Is that correct?

1602
01:58:21,409 --> 01:58:23,819
Which one should I do?

1603
01:58:23,819 --> 01:58:24,659
Can I do all three?

1604
01:58:24,859 --> 01:58:32,479
I think I can only pick one.

1605
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:34,470
Do sus?

1606
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,789
Zap actually, do zap actually?

1607
01:58:36,789 --> 01:58:38,829
He doesn't get it.

1608
01:58:38,829 --> 01:58:41,710
Do zap.

1609
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:43,109
Oh, I can do them all.

1610
01:58:43,109 --> 01:58:44,109
You glance across the water,

1611
01:58:44,109 --> 01:58:46,510
identifying the reflection of the stars of the zap spell.

1612
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:49,109
In the water, the constellation of zen is formed.

1613
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:51,310
Perhaps the pattern of lightning negates

1614
01:58:51,310 --> 01:58:53,229
the spell of levitation.

1615
01:58:53,229 --> 01:58:54,380
Okay.

1616
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:55,300
The gum spell.

1617
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,399
I already knew this one.

1618
01:58:57,399 --> 01:59:05,819
All right, gum, okay.

1619
01:59:05,819 --> 01:59:07,619
You find the image of the gum spell,

1620
01:59:07,619 --> 01:59:10,180
whose stars form the shape of the zip spell.

1621
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:12,420
It would seem the enchantment of gluing

1622
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:17,439
is opposed by that of teleportation.

1623
01:59:17,439 --> 01:59:20,739
Sus.

1624
01:59:20,739 --> 01:59:24,380
Closer to the shoreline lie the stars of the gack spell.

1625
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:26,619
The new shape matches the sus spell.

1626
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:27,960
Incredible.

1627
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:32,020
The spell of suspicion unbinds the magic of fear.

1628
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:33,939
Ooh.

1629
01:59:33,939 --> 01:59:36,060
Suddenly, the waters smash open

1630
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:38,539
as an enormous creature bursts up from below.

1631
01:59:40,539 --> 01:59:43,680
It has three racks of nightmarish teeth,

1632
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:44,640
and they are open.

1633
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,239
That was a monster.

1634
01:59:46,279 --> 01:59:56,789
And they are coming your way.

1635
01:59:56,789 --> 01:59:58,779
Let's talk.

1636
01:59:58,779 --> 02:00:05,729
Talk with animals.

1637
02:00:05,729 --> 02:00:07,010
Grabbing the wig from your pack,

1638
02:00:07,010 --> 02:00:08,850
you wear it and weave your spell.

1639
02:00:08,850 --> 02:00:10,649
A moment later, the fish's thrashings

1640
02:00:10,649 --> 02:00:13,829
turn into clear words in your head.

1641
02:00:13,829 --> 02:00:15,399
Come on.

1642
02:00:15,399 --> 02:00:18,859
Step into the water where I can taste you.

1643
02:00:18,859 --> 02:00:20,020
Step in.

1644
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:22,420
The water is warm.

1645
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:24,060
I am your friend.

1646
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:27,289
Step in.

1647
02:00:27,289 --> 02:00:30,050
I will not come closer.

1648
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:32,329
In a language formed of the slapping of your boots

1649
02:00:32,329 --> 02:00:34,319
against the sandy shore,

1650
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:36,319
the fish freezes in its tracks.

1651
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:38,720
It speaks.

1652
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:39,560
It mutters.

1653
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,640
It cannot speak.

1654
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:41,800
It is a mere insect.

1655
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,079
Insects do not speak.

1656
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:48,810
I speak.

1657
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:51,210
Then come closer so we may truly talk.

1658
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:56,569
Clearly curious as to how this conversation might proceed.

1659
02:00:58,770 --> 02:00:59,850
I'm stepping in.

1660
02:00:59,850 --> 02:01:00,689
I'm going in.

1661
02:01:00,689 --> 02:01:02,819
Step in.

1662
02:01:02,819 --> 02:01:04,939
You forward, step into the shallows.

1663
02:01:04,939 --> 02:01:06,899
The fish dives forward at tremendous speed,

1664
02:01:06,899 --> 02:01:07,739
knocking you over.

1665
02:01:07,739 --> 02:01:08,579
The wig falls.

1666
02:01:08,579 --> 02:01:12,010
God damn it.

1667
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:17,539
I'm, I'm, I'm reminding.

1668
02:01:18,539 --> 02:01:20,960
I'm, I have to.

1669
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:26,210
I want to talk.

1670
02:01:26,210 --> 02:01:29,420
I want to talk.

1671
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:31,279
All right, the suss spell.

1672
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:32,859
That's gack.

1673
02:01:32,859 --> 02:01:34,539
The fix spell.

1674
02:01:34,539 --> 02:01:36,239
Ooh, this is different.

1675
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:37,920
The image of the how spell

1676
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,840
who starts from the shape of the fix spell.

1677
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,760
It would seem the enchantment of pathfinding

1678
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:44,899
is opposed by that of attachment.

1679
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:46,140
The goblin spell.

1680
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:46,979
Yep, zip.

1681
02:01:46,979 --> 02:01:49,260
Okay, here we go.

1682
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,100
Here comes the fish.

1683
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:57,140
Cast a spell.

1684
02:01:57,140 --> 02:01:59,609
I want to talk.

1685
02:01:59,609 --> 02:02:01,680
Talk with animals.

1686
02:02:01,680 --> 02:02:03,380
I am your friend.

1687
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:05,460
I will not come closer.

1688
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,100
How does it talk?

1689
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:09,010
Is it possible?

1690
02:02:09,010 --> 02:02:09,850
Okay.

1691
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:15,689
What can you tell me of the seven serpents?

1692
02:02:15,689 --> 02:02:17,369
I know of many serpents.

1693
02:02:18,489 --> 02:02:19,890
They live in the lake.

1694
02:02:19,890 --> 02:02:21,130
I will show you.

1695
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:23,909
Come with me.

1696
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:25,989
I will not step into the water.

1697
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:30,600
Oh, please.

1698
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:33,500
It tries, please.

1699
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,380
I will not step in the water.

1700
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:38,340
Please step in the water, please.

1701
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:40,060
I will not step in the water.

1702
02:02:40,060 --> 02:02:41,380
Please get in the water.

1703
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:43,020
Please, it's comfortable.

1704
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:44,659
I will not step in the water.

1705
02:02:45,579 --> 02:02:47,060
Please, just come in at the waters.

1706
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,939
I'm not gonna step in the water.

1707
02:02:48,939 --> 02:02:50,659
Please, step in the water, please.

1708
02:02:50,659 --> 02:02:52,789
I'm not gonna step in the water.

1709
02:02:52,789 --> 02:02:54,909
Please, just step in, we can hang out.

1710
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:57,619
I will not step in the water.

1711
02:02:57,619 --> 02:02:58,939
Please.

1712
02:02:58,939 --> 02:03:02,180
All right, I'm fucking done talking to you.

1713
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:03,899
You had enough.

1714
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:05,579
It is clear this creature cannot harm you

1715
02:03:05,579 --> 02:03:07,449
if you stay out of the lake.

1716
02:03:07,449 --> 02:03:09,850
After a few minutes of gnashing its teeth at you,

1717
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:18,020
it flicks its tail and disappears below once more.

1718
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:26,619
I wanted to talk.

1719
02:03:26,619 --> 02:03:30,180
All right, let's go sleep.

1720
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:31,020
Looking across the water,

1721
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:34,939
you have a strong sense of how far you still have to go.

1722
02:03:34,939 --> 02:03:36,380
You cannot hope to swim.

1723
02:03:37,939 --> 02:03:41,140
After all, that stepping in the water just eats you.

1724
02:03:41,140 --> 02:03:44,819
That's so stupid.

1725
02:03:44,819 --> 02:03:46,739
Okay, you cannot hope to swim across,

1726
02:03:46,739 --> 02:03:50,060
so there's no progress to be made now.

1727
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:51,380
I'm not gonna sleep by the shore.

1728
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:53,979
I feel like it's gonna eat me.

1729
02:03:53,979 --> 02:03:58,260
Sleep in a stall.

1730
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:00,220
You find an open market stall

1731
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:03,260
and lie down under the shelter of its canopied roof.

1732
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:05,220
It smells of fish,

1733
02:04:05,220 --> 02:04:08,140
but the walls should keep any animals at bay.

1734
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:09,899
Laying your pack down on the shore of the lake,

1735
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:11,979
you try to settle despite the cold.

1736
02:04:11,979 --> 02:04:14,189
You have not eaten yet today,

1737
02:04:14,189 --> 02:04:17,859
but you have no rations to fill your belly.

1738
02:04:17,859 --> 02:04:22,270
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1739
02:04:22,270 --> 02:04:26,539
Dormammu, Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1740
02:04:26,539 --> 02:04:30,500
Oh, this is ridiculous, huh?

1741
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:36,100
Hey, Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1742
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:38,699
That's so funny.

1743
02:04:38,699 --> 02:04:41,810
Please step in the water, please.

1744
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:46,560
Release me, release me at once.

1745
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,399
Okay, wait.

1746
02:04:47,399 --> 02:04:49,979
You stretch out and rest.

1747
02:04:49,979 --> 02:04:51,500
I stole that from chat, by the way.

1748
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:55,829
Just so you know, I gotta give credit to the chat joke.

1749
02:04:55,829 --> 02:04:58,659
You feel a strange calm settling over you.

1750
02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:01,069
Run?

1751
02:05:01,069 --> 02:05:07,149
Why would I run if I'm getting comfortable?

1752
02:05:07,149 --> 02:05:08,869
You stretch out and rest.

1753
02:05:08,869 --> 02:05:10,949
You feel a strange calm settling over you.

1754
02:05:10,949 --> 02:05:14,060
Why would I get up and run?

1755
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:16,159
I'm gonna run, run.

1756
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:18,939
Something in the air, a poison perhaps.

1757
02:05:18,939 --> 02:05:19,979
You ready yourself to run,

1758
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:22,979
but then a voice appears in your mind.

1759
02:05:22,979 --> 02:05:25,229
Do not be afraid.

1760
02:05:25,229 --> 02:05:29,359
I have slowed time enough that I may speak to you again.

1761
02:05:29,359 --> 02:05:33,210
It is Lorag.

1762
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:35,229
All right, Lorag's back.

1763
02:05:35,229 --> 02:05:37,340
You have returned.

1764
02:05:37,340 --> 02:05:38,460
I have.

1765
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:43,180
I've been working to decipher your parchment,

1766
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:47,260
and now I have the answer.

1767
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:49,939
I thought you had abandoned me.

1768
02:05:49,939 --> 02:05:50,779
No.

1769
02:05:52,779 --> 02:05:54,779
But the parchment was older and stranger

1770
02:05:54,779 --> 02:05:57,899
than I had expected.

1771
02:05:57,899 --> 02:06:00,149
What did it say?

1772
02:06:00,149 --> 02:06:04,369
The parchment speaks of the serpent of time,

1773
02:06:04,369 --> 02:06:07,609
a creature who can see the moments to come

1774
02:06:07,609 --> 02:06:10,539
and move freely through those long gone.

1775
02:06:10,539 --> 02:06:12,260
A creature that exists now,

1776
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:15,289
but also exists long into the past.

1777
02:06:15,289 --> 02:06:18,770
It swims in time the way a fish swims in water,

1778
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:23,689
and thus it cannot be killed.

1779
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:26,060
And what can I do?

1780
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:28,619
You must turn its own strength against it.

1781
02:06:29,819 --> 02:06:35,619
You must catch the serpent in a cage of its own devising.

1782
02:06:35,619 --> 02:06:38,069
I do not understand.

1783
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:41,310
The serpent swims in time,

1784
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:44,750
so you must take control of time itself.

1785
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:49,670
Of course, the writer of the parchment

1786
02:06:49,670 --> 02:06:54,920
does not say how to do that.

1787
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:57,460
Then what can I do?

1788
02:06:57,460 --> 02:07:01,939
There is a line, a verse that maybe points the way.

1789
02:07:01,939 --> 02:07:05,390
In time, all things must end at last.

1790
02:07:05,390 --> 02:07:08,300
The back and forth of ages past.

1791
02:07:08,300 --> 02:07:11,829
Time's great light will cast a pall.

1792
02:07:11,829 --> 02:07:16,630
Two times too many, time will fall.

1793
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:19,340
What does it mean?

1794
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,520
I don't know.

1795
02:07:22,520 --> 02:07:24,640
I don't know.

1796
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:25,479
He's just gone.

1797
02:07:30,100 --> 02:07:32,069
You seem left alone here,

1798
02:07:32,069 --> 02:07:36,979
and your night is unbroken by dreams.

1799
02:07:36,979 --> 02:07:48,250
Lorag was on FaceTime on the toilet.

1800
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:49,529
I was trying to give him some character,

1801
02:07:49,529 --> 02:07:53,449
like it's like a struggle to talk through time and space

1802
02:07:53,449 --> 02:07:59,060
and he's old and he's like 500 years old.

1803
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,500
It's probably hard to do that.

1804
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:10,539
All right, you gained a huge amount of gold

1805
02:08:10,539 --> 02:08:12,899
and you got the sun serpent.

1806
02:08:12,939 --> 02:08:17,239
Well, it keeps telling us we got the sun serpent.

1807
02:08:17,239 --> 02:08:25,449
That was like 12 days ago.

1808
02:08:25,449 --> 02:08:28,609
The sun rises bringing with it chatter and excitement

1809
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:30,170
as stall holders and fishermen

1810
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:32,760
begin to gather at the shoreline.

1811
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:37,760
The sun has not yet crested the last peaks in the east.

1812
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,960
Please come to the water, please.

1813
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:46,890
All right, we need to buy something.

1814
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:48,289
On the other side of the bay area

1815
02:08:48,289 --> 02:08:50,409
from the waterfront is the line of stalls.

1816
02:08:50,409 --> 02:08:54,000
Most sell food, grilled fish and fruit,

1817
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,359
though there is also a bottle seller

1818
02:08:55,359 --> 02:08:57,600
selling stoppard bottles.

1819
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,020
All right, let's go buy everything.

1820
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,220
You greet the fruit seller

1821
02:09:01,220 --> 02:09:03,979
who waves his hand across the selection.

1822
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:09,069
One apple, two gold pieces, finest Zanzuna apples.

1823
02:09:09,069 --> 02:09:10,979
Buy some fruit.

1824
02:09:10,979 --> 02:09:12,579
I'll buy some apples.

1825
02:09:12,579 --> 02:09:13,829
How many?

1826
02:09:13,829 --> 02:09:16,100
I'll buy four.

1827
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:17,579
That's eight gold to you.

1828
02:09:20,539 --> 02:09:22,539
Visit the fishmonger.

1829
02:09:22,539 --> 02:09:23,819
The fishmonger is a large woman

1830
02:09:23,819 --> 02:09:26,100
who wields an enormous cleaver.

1831
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:28,020
I'll chop it and grill it for you.

1832
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:31,550
She announces staring you threateningly in the eye.

1833
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:34,880
Four gold pieces per head.

1834
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:38,729
I'll buy some, please.

1835
02:09:38,729 --> 02:09:40,659
This one's bigger than the rest.

1836
02:09:40,659 --> 02:09:41,859
The woman advises you,

1837
02:09:41,859 --> 02:09:43,859
pointing at one of the fish in particular.

1838
02:09:43,859 --> 02:09:46,800
The difference is not discernible to your eye.

1839
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,159
I'm buying four.

1840
02:09:49,159 --> 02:09:52,239
You pay the woman 16 gold pieces

1841
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:54,319
and she slaps four fish onto her griddle,

1842
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:56,479
squeezes them over with lemon,

1843
02:09:56,479 --> 02:09:58,880
throws on a couple of unlikely looking herbs

1844
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:01,939
and then lets them fry.

1845
02:10:01,939 --> 02:10:03,659
Was that Pavlovian, was that guy

1846
02:10:03,659 --> 02:10:06,939
that said the burrito from earlier?

1847
02:10:06,939 --> 02:10:08,300
After a few minutes and a smell

1848
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,479
that makes your stomach ache with hunger,

1849
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:13,130
she slides the cooked fish off the griddle

1850
02:10:13,130 --> 02:10:16,039
and onto some thick cheesecloth for carrying.

1851
02:10:16,039 --> 02:10:16,960
The skin is so hot,

1852
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,819
it makes your fingers blister to touch.

1853
02:10:20,819 --> 02:10:25,100
There was a way that food was described in books,

1854
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:29,100
especially books about kind of older time periods

1855
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:32,470
or things that are supposed to be kind of a little older.

1856
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:35,800
They always make it sound so delicious,

1857
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:39,939
but I bet you this food stunk and was gross.

1858
02:10:39,939 --> 02:10:41,439
You know what I mean?

1859
02:10:41,439 --> 02:10:42,760
I want to eat this fish right now,

1860
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:47,600
but it probably was awful.

1861
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:49,600
Like, oh, the succulent meat of the fish.

1862
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:53,250
That fish probably is not very good,

1863
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,329
but I always read it and I'm like,

1864
02:10:54,329 --> 02:10:57,149
mm, I want, oh, what is it?

1865
02:10:57,149 --> 02:10:58,310
How are you describing this?

1866
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:05,789
Oh, this onion bulb in water, boiled.

1867
02:11:05,789 --> 02:11:09,220
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.

1868
02:11:09,220 --> 02:11:11,550
No, not really.

1869
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:16,029
I'm like, ooh, that sounds amazing.

1870
02:11:16,029 --> 02:11:19,750
A boiled onion bulb in water

1871
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:21,590
and a chunk of bread that's stale

1872
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:27,359
and probably like three weeks old, ooh.

1873
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:30,579
Or it's better because it's not affected by pollution.

1874
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:34,989
That's actually a huge deal, huge deal.

1875
02:11:34,989 --> 02:11:38,680
This could be unbelievably succulent.

1876
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:40,810
It could be the best food ever,

1877
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:45,380
not full of like microplastics.

1878
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:47,470
All right, eat one now.

1879
02:11:47,470 --> 02:11:48,829
You eat one of the fish there and then

1880
02:11:48,829 --> 02:11:50,390
before it grows cold.

1881
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:52,550
It's excellent, succulent,

1882
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:56,500
and clearly only caught a few hours previously.

1883
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:00,390
The woman nods, I see you're enjoying that.

1884
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,800
Oh, are these fish local?

1885
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,960
You ask as you finish up your meal.

1886
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:07,979
It looks at you like you must be stupid.

1887
02:12:07,979 --> 02:12:09,859
The lake is right there.

1888
02:12:09,899 --> 02:12:12,539
Where else would we get them from?

1889
02:12:12,539 --> 02:12:14,260
Oh, can you introduce me to the chef?

1890
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:18,359
Can you introduce me to the fisherman?

1891
02:12:21,810 --> 02:12:23,369
Whatever for?

1892
02:12:23,369 --> 02:12:26,649
You don't like my prices?

1893
02:12:26,649 --> 02:12:29,989
I just want to talk to them.

1894
02:12:31,949 --> 02:12:37,579
They're not ones for talking, our men, she replies.

1895
02:12:37,579 --> 02:12:42,579
I want passage across the lake.

1896
02:12:42,579 --> 02:12:44,539
This is real Karen behavior.

1897
02:12:44,539 --> 02:12:47,600
No, this is reverse Karen, guys.

1898
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,979
This is like, oh my God, that was so good.

1899
02:12:50,979 --> 02:12:52,760
I want to talk to the manager.

1900
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:54,760
Manager comes out, unbelievable work.

1901
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:55,600
I love it here.

1902
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,560
This is amazing, you're doing an unbelievable job.

1903
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,079
Incredible job, all of you.

1904
02:12:59,079 --> 02:13:02,020
You should all be very proud of yourselves.

1905
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:03,220
Why are you filming us?

1906
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:05,460
Well, I wanted to document how much I love this place

1907
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:15,699
and how wonderful this has been.

1908
02:13:15,699 --> 02:13:16,739
It's still annoying.

1909
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:20,869
Two sides of the same coin.

1910
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:36,619
Okay, I want to go back and turn the thing around.

1911
02:13:36,619 --> 02:13:38,979
There's too many fucking sides to this coin.

1912
02:13:43,069 --> 02:13:45,340
No matter, the lady shakes her head,

1913
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:48,149
but lets the matter drop.

1914
02:13:48,149 --> 02:13:49,710
You finish your fish.

1915
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:53,670
Let's buy some bottles, we're stocking up.

1916
02:13:53,670 --> 02:13:56,510
You stop at the bottle seller stall.

1917
02:13:56,510 --> 02:13:58,229
He has shelves and shelves of bottles

1918
02:13:58,229 --> 02:14:01,029
of all different shapes and sizes and colors.

1919
02:14:01,029 --> 02:14:03,789
A few are filled, but most are empty.

1920
02:14:03,789 --> 02:14:09,659
You greet the bottle seller.

1921
02:14:09,659 --> 02:14:12,010
Ask about the bottles.

1922
02:14:12,010 --> 02:14:14,300
You have a lot of bottles here.

1923
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:17,020
The bottle seller smiles.

1924
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:19,659
It's not my passion, if that's what you mean.

1925
02:14:20,539 --> 02:14:26,670
But I'm very, very good at making bottles, as you can see.

1926
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:28,979
I mean, look at the filled bottles.

1927
02:14:28,979 --> 02:14:30,819
You scan over the filled bottles.

1928
02:14:30,819 --> 02:14:33,100
Most seem to contain nothing but colored water

1929
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:34,859
and are probably filled to simply show off

1930
02:14:34,859 --> 02:14:36,829
the craftsmanship of the glass.

1931
02:14:36,829 --> 02:14:38,670
But a rack at the front appears to contain

1932
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:41,399
blimberry potion and the row behind is labeled

1933
02:14:41,399 --> 02:14:45,779
holy water from the temple of the mule.

1934
02:14:45,779 --> 02:14:48,880
We're buying everything.

1935
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,600
Blimberry potions, the finest source from the wet marsh

1936
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:55,279
of Lake Lumley itself.

1937
02:14:55,279 --> 02:14:58,979
Seven gold pieces each.

1938
02:14:58,979 --> 02:15:02,020
That's very expensive, you observe.

1939
02:15:02,020 --> 02:15:04,539
It's not entirely the cost of the liquid.

1940
02:15:04,539 --> 02:15:06,979
The bottle is of the highest quality as well.

1941
02:15:13,930 --> 02:15:23,010
That's a lot.

1942
02:15:23,010 --> 02:15:26,130
That's seven, 14, 26.

1943
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:29,000
That's too much.

1944
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:34,520
I'll take three.

1945
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:39,270
We cannot, we can't choose right now.

1946
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:42,600
If there's three healing potions, I'm buying everything.

1947
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:45,260
How much is the holy water?

1948
02:15:45,260 --> 02:15:46,539
I'll take three, you tell him.

1949
02:15:46,539 --> 02:15:47,500
He hands them over carefully.

1950
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:50,319
Be careful of the glass.

1951
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:52,439
Holy water is most valuable.

1952
02:15:52,439 --> 02:15:54,960
An excellent wedding present, for example.

1953
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,199
And good for magic.

1954
02:15:56,199 --> 02:15:57,960
Hence the craftsmanship of the glass.

1955
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:04,149
10 gold pieces.

1956
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:11,729
No, all my money.

1957
02:16:11,729 --> 02:16:14,460
I'll buy one.

1958
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:16,470
He passes it to you.

1959
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:17,590
Look at the empty bottles.

1960
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:20,680
We're stocking up.

1961
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:23,039
You look over the man's collection of empty bottles.

1962
02:16:23,039 --> 02:16:25,359
They come in every size, from that of your thumb

1963
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:28,439
to tankards as large as your thigh.

1964
02:16:28,439 --> 02:16:30,159
There are thin bottles and portly bottles

1965
02:16:30,159 --> 02:16:32,520
in bottles in every shade of colored glass.

1966
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:35,200
Some twist and corkscrew, some are delicately fluted.

1967
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:38,379
Most are very well made indeed.

1968
02:16:38,379 --> 02:16:40,250
Bid farewell.

1969
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:41,690
You bid farewell to the bottle seller.

1970
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:43,520
You move away from the stalls.

1971
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,000
Okay, I have a ton of food.

1972
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,680
I have three healing potions.

1973
02:16:46,680 --> 02:16:52,319
I still have 50 gold.

1974
02:16:52,319 --> 02:16:54,600
Do you think the fish is still there?

1975
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:56,819
Let's find out.

1976
02:16:56,819 --> 02:17:05,750
These are tourist prices.

1977
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:07,069
You walk down to the shoreline.

1978
02:17:07,069 --> 02:17:09,840
The water looks clean and inviting.

1979
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,959
Though it is almost certainly freezing cold.

1980
02:17:11,959 --> 02:17:14,520
In the far distance, boats punt this way

1981
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:17,889
and that between scattered islands.

1982
02:17:17,889 --> 02:17:19,700
Swim across the lake.

1983
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,659
Call out for a boat.

1984
02:17:20,659 --> 02:17:22,120
Blow the whistle.

1985
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:25,409
Grow the, they keep wanting me to do this.

1986
02:17:25,409 --> 02:17:29,110
It's just gonna break and he's gonna come out and eat me.

1987
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,149
The water serpent's not here.

1988
02:17:30,149 --> 02:17:33,370
I'm gonna step away.

1989
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:35,840
We're not swimming in here.

1990
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,680
I'm gonna go back.

1991
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:38,559
I'm gonna turn this away.

1992
02:17:38,559 --> 02:17:42,459
We're gonna check out this area again.

1993
02:17:42,459 --> 02:17:47,459
And then we're gonna try to get the water serpent.

1994
02:17:47,459 --> 02:17:49,059
Would the water, would the sun serpent

1995
02:17:49,059 --> 02:17:53,389
immediately die in the water?

1996
02:17:53,389 --> 02:17:57,600
That's a good point.

1997
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:04,329
Maybe I'll try it when we go back.

1998
02:18:04,329 --> 02:18:12,129
Just keep going.

1999
02:18:12,129 --> 02:18:18,520
Hold on.

2000
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:21,069
Oh shit.

2001
02:18:21,069 --> 02:18:22,510
Oh shit, go back.

2002
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:23,350
Let's go back.

2003
02:18:23,350 --> 02:18:24,170
We gotta go back.

2004
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:28,979
The sun serpent is only vulnerable to water.

2005
02:18:28,979 --> 02:18:31,020
It's like, okay.

2006
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:38,239
I wanna hear the best part of this song though.

2007
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:39,399
We haven't heard the best part of this song.

2008
02:18:39,399 --> 02:18:44,459
It keeps playing, it loops a different way.

2009
02:18:44,459 --> 02:19:05,030
It's coming up here.

2010
02:19:05,069 --> 02:19:07,239
What's that part?

2011
02:19:07,239 --> 02:19:08,569
Zap.

2012
02:19:08,569 --> 02:19:10,219
God.

2013
02:19:10,219 --> 02:19:21,260
I love these illustrations so much.

2014
02:19:21,260 --> 02:19:27,329
I love this one.

2015
02:19:27,329 --> 02:19:37,299
Dim.

2016
02:19:37,299 --> 02:19:39,629
Look at this one.

2017
02:19:39,629 --> 02:19:41,250
Magic.

2018
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:56,739
Spell protects its caster from most magics.

2019
02:19:56,739 --> 02:20:02,159
I like this one too a lot.

2020
02:20:02,159 --> 02:20:03,000
It's like.

2021
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:10,180
This one's good too.

2022
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:11,260
Gob?

2023
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:16,049
Yob.

2024
02:20:16,049 --> 02:20:16,889
Mm-hmm.

2025
02:20:16,889 --> 02:20:23,459
Look at the leg just sticking out.

2026
02:20:23,459 --> 02:20:29,979
Sus.

2027
02:20:29,979 --> 02:20:32,379
So this is what they look like, right?

2028
02:20:32,379 --> 02:20:33,659
Kind of like an invisible shield.

2029
02:20:33,659 --> 02:20:38,239
It's cool.

2030
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:47,450
Big.

2031
02:20:47,450 --> 02:20:51,680
This is another one of my favorites.

2032
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:58,649
There's just something so whimsical about all these.

2033
02:20:58,649 --> 02:21:06,100
They're all whimsical and oddly terrifying.

2034
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:09,639
Somebody said, why are some of them black?

2035
02:21:09,639 --> 02:21:13,959
I think the ones that have a black background are,

2036
02:21:13,959 --> 02:21:20,139
I think they're storyline.

2037
02:21:20,139 --> 02:21:21,299
Maybe not, no.

2038
02:21:21,299 --> 02:21:23,340
Because fog is not storyline.

2039
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:24,700
Oh, they're found spells.

2040
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:28,469
Okay, that's what it is.

2041
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:32,559
It's huff.

2042
02:21:32,559 --> 02:21:37,110
I love this one because, is that a wand?

2043
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:42,940
A tree branch for a wand or a staff?

2044
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:43,979
These are so inspired.

2045
02:21:43,979 --> 02:21:48,739
I want physical prints of these.

2046
02:21:48,739 --> 02:21:55,600
Yeah, they're wonderful.

2047
02:21:56,899 --> 02:21:59,420
Invisibility, right?

2048
02:21:59,420 --> 02:22:01,139
This one's cool because you become invisible

2049
02:22:01,139 --> 02:22:04,659
to any reasonably intelligent creature.

2050
02:22:04,659 --> 02:22:06,620
Less intelligent creatures will only be

2051
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:08,909
partially convinced.

2052
02:22:08,909 --> 02:22:12,049
They'll be partially convinced.

2053
02:22:12,049 --> 02:22:23,170
So the dumber you are, the less this works on you.

2054
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:27,459
So yeah, there's a big green wig, right?

2055
02:22:27,459 --> 02:22:29,100
They kind of think you are invisible.

2056
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,219
How, yeah.

2057
02:22:30,219 --> 02:22:34,459
Partially, partially, partially, partially.

2058
02:22:34,459 --> 02:22:36,920
Am I saying it wrong?

2059
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:37,959
You are partially.

2060
02:22:37,959 --> 02:22:38,799
What?

2061
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:39,639
Is this weird?

2062
02:22:39,639 --> 02:22:40,459
Partially.

2063
02:22:40,459 --> 02:22:41,299
Why can't I not say this word?

2064
02:22:41,299 --> 02:22:43,379
Partially, partially?

2065
02:22:43,379 --> 02:22:45,379
There's no N in partially.

2066
02:22:45,379 --> 02:22:47,190
Why do I want to put an N there?

2067
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:50,649
Partially, it's like I'm like shit-faced.

2068
02:22:50,649 --> 02:22:55,459
Yeah, you've become partially invisible.

2069
02:22:55,459 --> 02:22:57,940
Partially, why am I adding an N?

2070
02:22:57,940 --> 02:23:08,840
Partially, talking to a rat.

2071
02:23:15,739 --> 02:23:19,639
Resurrect the dead.

2072
02:23:19,639 --> 02:23:23,680
Oh, this one's cool.

2073
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:27,620
And then, Zed.

2074
02:23:27,620 --> 02:23:32,959
Zed, the most formidable spell in lore,

2075
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:35,770
but no one knows why.

2076
02:23:35,770 --> 02:23:37,889
In all recorded history, this spell has only been cast

2077
02:23:37,889 --> 02:23:41,500
once by a powerful necromancer from Throbin,

2078
02:23:41,500 --> 02:23:43,909
who was never seen again.

2079
02:23:43,909 --> 02:23:45,690
Its effects are unknown.

2080
02:23:45,690 --> 02:23:47,770
The necromancer's notes were found,

2081
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:50,350
but were crazed and unclear.

2082
02:23:50,350 --> 02:23:54,319
Treat with extreme caution.

2083
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:58,659
I love how it's a question mark.

2084
02:23:58,659 --> 02:24:06,659
Zed, cast it right now.

2085
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:16,440
That was nice.

2086
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:18,739
All right, what were we doing?

2087
02:24:18,739 --> 02:24:25,350
Oh, I was turning this around.

2088
02:24:25,350 --> 02:24:27,840
The Canadian spell?

2089
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,170
Why?

2090
02:24:29,170 --> 02:24:31,059
Because Zed?

2091
02:24:31,059 --> 02:24:31,899
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2092
02:24:31,899 --> 02:24:33,100
I was going to throw the stone in the water.

2093
02:24:33,100 --> 02:24:41,670
Let's do that.

2094
02:24:41,670 --> 02:24:42,489
Oh, the orb.

2095
02:24:42,489 --> 02:24:51,319
When I say stone, the orb.

2096
02:24:51,319 --> 02:24:52,239
No, do a poll.

2097
02:24:52,239 --> 02:25:02,450
Befriend the sun serpent.

2098
02:25:02,450 --> 02:25:07,079
Throw the sun serpent orb into the water.

2099
02:25:07,079 --> 02:25:12,739
You mean everywhere, not America.

2100
02:25:12,739 --> 02:25:13,739
No, no, don't.

2101
02:25:13,739 --> 02:25:14,780
Not yet.

2102
02:25:14,780 --> 02:25:18,100
Do it.

2103
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:19,920
Save it.

2104
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:23,399
Get a powerful snake bud.

2105
02:25:23,399 --> 02:25:29,559
Throw the sun serpent at the water serpent.

2106
02:25:29,559 --> 02:25:33,879
Throw it at the water serpent?

2107
02:25:33,879 --> 02:25:35,909
Well, can I do that?

2108
02:25:35,909 --> 02:25:36,909
Should I try to do that,

2109
02:25:36,909 --> 02:25:40,639
or should I just throw it in there now?

2110
02:25:40,639 --> 02:25:44,489
Do it at night, bro.

2111
02:25:44,489 --> 02:25:47,149
Wait for night.

2112
02:25:47,149 --> 02:25:48,469
Do they cancel each other?

2113
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:56,479
That would be crazy if they did.

2114
02:25:56,479 --> 02:25:57,809
Well, I'll try it.

2115
02:25:57,809 --> 02:25:59,489
All right, we need to rewind time, then.

2116
02:25:59,489 --> 02:26:04,110
We need to get this out of the way.

2117
02:26:04,110 --> 02:26:04,950
That sounds right.

2118
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:17,030
All right, whatever, I'll try it.

2119
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:21,530
We're gonna point the orb away.

2120
02:26:21,530 --> 02:26:23,250
Come on, bro, please.

2121
02:26:26,079 --> 02:26:28,559
The lady who had it said they had a doomed love.

2122
02:26:28,559 --> 02:26:30,760
Oh, that's right.

2123
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:32,459
That's not just random.

2124
02:26:32,459 --> 02:26:34,690
That's true.

2125
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:36,100
Please, bro.

2126
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:40,030
Come on, bro, please.

2127
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:45,069
Is that jiggle physics?

2128
02:26:45,069 --> 02:26:50,120
What?

2129
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:55,100
What are you talking about?

2130
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:55,940
We'll sleep here.

2131
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:01,600
You settle down.

2132
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:03,239
At least you do not need to eat.

2133
02:27:03,239 --> 02:27:05,139
I'll probably eat again.

2134
02:27:05,139 --> 02:27:13,040
Let's get up to 20.

2135
02:27:13,079 --> 02:27:14,719
Got a lot of provisions.

2136
02:27:14,719 --> 02:27:28,239
You lost a huge amount of gold.

2137
02:27:28,239 --> 02:27:30,569
Adjust the beam.

2138
02:27:30,569 --> 02:27:35,260
And what should we point this?

2139
02:27:35,260 --> 02:27:40,680
Is there anything I can aim this at?

2140
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:41,520
I don't think there's something

2141
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,540
I can do with this right now.

2142
02:27:43,540 --> 02:27:47,059
Let's turn it backwards, like this way.

2143
02:27:47,059 --> 02:27:47,979
I guess I could go over here,

2144
02:27:47,979 --> 02:28:00,270
but yeah, we'll just point it out of the way for now.

2145
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:08,909
All right, water serpent time.

2146
02:28:08,909 --> 02:28:10,840
Why are you doing your bit voice?

2147
02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:13,520
I think my bit voice is just me talking in my normal,

2148
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:19,440
just regular speaking voice.

2149
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:23,879
I think that's the way you're referring to.

2150
02:28:23,879 --> 02:28:25,680
The right bit voice.

2151
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:28,879
I love that my, just me sitting here talking

2152
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:31,280
is like, wow, he's about to do something weird.

2153
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,639
Something's about to happen.

2154
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:34,239
He's gonna turn the camera on

2155
02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:39,120
and he's gonna be like hanging upside down in his room

2156
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,559
in like a Santa costume or something.

2157
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:41,399
You know what I mean?

2158
02:28:41,399 --> 02:28:46,969
Like you're just waiting for the camera to turn on.

2159
02:28:46,969 --> 02:28:49,459
You already did that, yeah.

2160
02:28:49,459 --> 02:28:53,180
Okay, so you follow the road.

2161
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:54,659
I haven't been here in the,

2162
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:58,299
wait, wait, wait, yeah, I haven't been here.

2163
02:28:58,299 --> 02:29:00,360
So is there nothing here?

2164
02:29:00,360 --> 02:29:01,200
How can you cross?

2165
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:02,600
There are no signs of either people or boats.

2166
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:07,120
So there's nothing here anymore in the present day.

2167
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,079
Let me walk along the shoreline.

2168
02:29:11,079 --> 02:29:14,079
For several strides, you follow the sandy shore eastwards

2169
02:29:14,079 --> 02:29:15,440
but find nothing of note.

2170
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:20,159
The shoreline ends in a collapsed seawall.

2171
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:21,360
Get some sand.

2172
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:23,200
You gather a handful of sand.

2173
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,200
In the distance over the water,

2174
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:28,280
a few bird-like creatures turn in the sky.

2175
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:30,799
Let's walk the other way.

2176
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:33,000
You walk back and try the other way.

2177
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,360
Again, you come across nothing

2178
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:37,840
that might help you get across.

2179
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,430
Blow the whistle.

2180
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:43,270
The sound of the whistle scuds across the open water.

2181
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:45,270
A few minutes later, the undergrowth nearby

2182
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:49,739
begins to rustle.

2183
02:29:49,739 --> 02:29:53,700
Wait.

2184
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,379
All right, all right.

2185
02:29:55,379 --> 02:29:56,700
Hold your horses.

2186
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:57,700
I'm coming.

2187
02:29:57,700 --> 02:30:00,110
What's your rush?

2188
02:30:00,110 --> 02:30:06,520
Grumbling voice from between the leaves.

2189
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:09,870
You are the ferryman.

2190
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:11,590
I will be in a moment.

2191
02:30:11,590 --> 02:30:14,120
If you'll just give me a second.

2192
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:16,280
You hear a sound which might well be

2193
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:19,969
the pulling on of one's trousers.

2194
02:30:19,969 --> 02:30:21,930
The man emerges from a bush.

2195
02:30:21,930 --> 02:30:24,290
A scruffy, unwashed individual.

2196
02:30:24,290 --> 02:30:27,709
Somewhat overweight, but with the shoulders of an ox.

2197
02:30:27,709 --> 02:30:29,389
That he no doubt needs to be,

2198
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:31,469
needs to pull across the water all day.

2199
02:30:31,469 --> 02:30:34,299
Was he just taking a shit in the bushes?

2200
02:30:34,299 --> 02:30:38,040
He scratches his chest thoughtfully.

2201
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:39,559
Greetings.

2202
02:30:39,559 --> 02:30:42,520
And greetings unto you, your scruffy tramp.

2203
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:44,840
He replies, scratching his nose as he speaks.

2204
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,629
Now, where to?

2205
02:30:48,629 --> 02:30:51,739
I wish to cross the lake.

2206
02:30:51,739 --> 02:30:54,020
Of course you want to cross the lake.

2207
02:30:54,020 --> 02:30:56,100
Everyone wants to cross the lake.

2208
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:58,739
Everyone that's around these parts anyway.

2209
02:30:58,739 --> 02:31:00,700
But I still ask, where to?

2210
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:03,040
It's my little jest.

2211
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:06,729
He wipes a little tear from an eye.

2212
02:31:06,729 --> 02:31:07,569
All right then.

2213
02:31:07,569 --> 02:31:12,010
Whatever you want on the lake for gold pieces.

2214
02:31:12,010 --> 02:31:16,430
Oh, I have the money.

2215
02:31:16,430 --> 02:31:18,120
You pay him the money.

2216
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:19,959
He disappears into the undergrowth once more

2217
02:31:19,959 --> 02:31:21,840
and reappears a few moments later.

2218
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:24,399
Dragging a heavy boat behind him.

2219
02:31:24,399 --> 02:31:27,420
Give me a hand, idiot.

2220
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:30,129
You are the ferryman.

2221
02:31:30,129 --> 02:31:32,559
I'll help.

2222
02:31:32,559 --> 02:31:34,600
Together you pull the boat into the water.

2223
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:36,520
It bobs and rocks in the shallows,

2224
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:39,659
but seems seaworthy enough.

2225
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:41,479
Don't go with him.

2226
02:31:41,479 --> 02:31:45,159
Why would I pay money to just be like, bye?

2227
02:31:45,159 --> 02:31:48,739
I thought it said, let him cook.

2228
02:31:48,739 --> 02:31:51,579
All right, get in the boat.

2229
02:31:51,579 --> 02:31:54,479
You get in and he pushes you out into the water

2230
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:58,079
and hops aboard himself.

2231
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:00,879
Okay.

2232
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:05,760
Away from the shore.

2233
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:07,760
The boat slides away from the shore.

2234
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:10,000
The afternoon is starting to draw on.

2235
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,120
The boat drifts.

2236
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:15,190
The ferryman stands at the prow, scanning the water.

2237
02:32:15,190 --> 02:32:17,069
You're going to the ancient road.

2238
02:32:17,069 --> 02:32:20,569
All the way to Haizamun?

2239
02:32:20,569 --> 02:32:21,930
I'm just a trader.

2240
02:32:21,930 --> 02:32:24,000
The ancient road?

2241
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,590
The ancient road?

2242
02:32:26,590 --> 02:32:28,719
Used to be a thriving settlement.

2243
02:32:28,719 --> 02:32:31,079
One of the most powerful cities in the world.

2244
02:32:31,079 --> 02:32:34,540
Before the curse, of course.

2245
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:36,069
Cursed.

2246
02:32:36,069 --> 02:32:39,600
This whole land is cursed.

2247
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,239
And everyone in it too.

2248
02:32:41,239 --> 02:32:45,040
But most of those in charge only care about land.

2249
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,440
Glancing down at the oars still resting in the boat,

2250
02:32:47,440 --> 02:32:52,620
and then at you, he shrugs his wide, heavy shoulders.

2251
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:56,850
Plenty of places to see on Lake Aklala, and a few below.

2252
02:32:56,850 --> 02:33:02,280
He hefts his pole and stares away into the distance.

2253
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:10,309
All right, what do you think, around here?

2254
02:33:10,309 --> 02:33:17,680
Maybe this way, get to the, let's go around here.

2255
02:33:17,680 --> 02:33:20,290
The ferryman pulls the boat onwards across the river.

2256
02:33:20,329 --> 02:33:23,620
The sun begins to dip, heading towards the horizon.

2257
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:25,180
It seems you have reached a part of the lake

2258
02:33:25,180 --> 02:33:27,530
that is too deep for the pole.

2259
02:33:27,530 --> 02:33:30,329
The ferryman points sharply at you and snaps.

2260
02:33:30,329 --> 02:33:33,139
Take the oars, fool, and start rowing.

2261
02:33:33,139 --> 02:33:35,860
Somehow his manner seems to have changed quite suddenly.

2262
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:40,920
His tone is altogether more aggressive.

2263
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,790
Take the oars.

2264
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:46,329
Take the oars?

2265
02:33:46,329 --> 02:33:53,559
I gotta row the boat?

2266
02:33:53,559 --> 02:33:56,670
Take the oars yourself, you declare,

2267
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:59,850
a hand falling to rest on your weapon.

2268
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:01,690
He nods twice to himself,

2269
02:34:01,690 --> 02:34:04,649
and steps down from the prow to near the row lock.

2270
02:34:04,649 --> 02:34:07,069
But he doesn't do anything for a moment more,

2271
02:34:07,069 --> 02:34:16,360
letting the boat drift on, near the island.

2272
02:34:16,360 --> 02:34:18,200
The ferryman continues to row.

2273
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:20,399
The wind picks up as the evening draws on.

2274
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:21,889
Soon it will be dark.

2275
02:34:21,889 --> 02:34:22,969
From his place at the oars,

2276
02:34:22,969 --> 02:34:25,719
the ferryman watches you thoughtfully.

2277
02:34:25,719 --> 02:34:27,719
You been to Tin Pang?

2278
02:34:27,719 --> 02:34:30,799
You from there?

2279
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:32,270
Why do you ask?

2280
02:34:32,270 --> 02:34:33,829
You reply, suspecting his question

2281
02:34:33,829 --> 02:34:36,620
conceals more below its surface.

2282
02:34:36,620 --> 02:34:38,809
Strange place, Tin Pang.

2283
02:34:38,809 --> 02:34:40,450
Was destroyed a long time ago,

2284
02:34:40,450 --> 02:34:44,110
turned into a ruin, completely abandoned.

2285
02:34:44,110 --> 02:34:45,469
Long, long time ago,

2286
02:34:45,469 --> 02:34:48,709
but people still come down the road time and time again,

2287
02:34:48,709 --> 02:34:51,209
wanting ferrying from there.

2288
02:34:51,209 --> 02:34:56,379
It's most of my trade.

2289
02:34:56,379 --> 02:34:59,190
Where do they go, these people?

2290
02:34:59,190 --> 02:35:00,639
Now that's a good question.

2291
02:35:00,639 --> 02:35:02,879
And the strange thing is, of all different places,

2292
02:35:02,879 --> 02:35:04,680
some are headed for the horns,

2293
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:06,280
trying to get across them,

2294
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:07,920
since the bridge is gone.

2295
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:09,520
Others want the Zamen Road,

2296
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:12,379
but are meaning to turn seltzer to sea.

2297
02:35:12,379 --> 02:35:17,329
Others still think the fortress will harbor them.

2298
02:35:17,329 --> 02:35:19,219
The fortress?

2299
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:21,180
The fortress of sorcerers.

2300
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:24,020
That's what Man Pang was called before it became Man Pang,

2301
02:35:24,059 --> 02:35:29,440
before the archmage really came into his own.

2302
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:34,540
The ferryman takes another long pole on the oars.

2303
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:37,120
Do any visit the islands?

2304
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,670
The islands?

2305
02:35:38,670 --> 02:35:40,270
No, why would they do that?

2306
02:35:40,270 --> 02:35:43,399
All the islands are empty.

2307
02:35:43,399 --> 02:35:44,360
Step it up.

2308
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,200
What do you mean, step it up?

2309
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:47,170
What?

2310
02:35:47,170 --> 02:35:51,129
Step it up.

2311
02:35:51,129 --> 02:35:56,559
Step it up?

2312
02:35:56,559 --> 02:35:59,500
Step it up?

2313
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:00,379
Okay.

2314
02:36:00,379 --> 02:36:02,360
Why are they always empty?

2315
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:04,600
Step it up?

2316
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:06,729
Were they always empty?

2317
02:36:06,729 --> 02:36:08,649
Hmm, most likely not.

2318
02:36:08,649 --> 02:36:10,989
Used to be a busy lake, this.

2319
02:36:11,389 --> 02:36:16,870
Well, I can see you'll never be setting foot in Tim Pang anyhow.

2320
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:22,450
You've come to within reach of the bay of a low island.

2321
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:26,920
Go ashore.

2322
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:30,200
The ferryman pulls at the oars in a regular rhythm.

2323
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:31,559
I'll get out here.

2324
02:36:31,559 --> 02:36:34,799
You say, he tips his hat as you approach land.

2325
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:37,559
Call if you need me again.

2326
02:36:37,559 --> 02:36:39,840
He remarks as he ships away.

2327
02:36:39,840 --> 02:36:42,719
The evening is drawing in.

2328
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:45,799
Get out of the boat.

2329
02:36:45,799 --> 02:36:48,799
The island is a rocky and barren place.

2330
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:52,860
In the center is a rise of land from which a tree grows.

2331
02:36:52,899 --> 02:36:59,170
In the shallows stands a tall pole from which hangs a bell.

2332
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:02,739
Look at the bell.

2333
02:37:02,739 --> 02:37:06,040
The bell is set with a silver clapper attached to a rope.

2334
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:10,440
The wind shifts a moment, bringing with it a terrible stench.

2335
02:37:10,440 --> 02:37:12,680
And then the smell is gone.

2336
02:37:12,680 --> 02:37:16,520
Ring the bell or explore inland.

2337
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:17,819
Let's just ring it, whatever.

2338
02:37:17,819 --> 02:37:20,879
Ring the bell.

2339
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:22,520
You tug the rope and the bell rings

2340
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:24,829
with a clear and steady chime.

2341
02:37:24,829 --> 02:37:26,629
After a few minutes, the boat slides out

2342
02:37:26,629 --> 02:37:28,389
of the mist of the lake towards you.

2343
02:37:28,389 --> 02:37:31,379
The ferryman hops down into the shallows.

2344
02:37:31,379 --> 02:37:32,959
You again?

2345
02:37:32,959 --> 02:37:35,870
Climb aboard.

2346
02:37:36,510 --> 02:37:38,549
Nevermind.

2347
02:37:38,549 --> 02:37:39,389
You wave him away.

2348
02:37:39,389 --> 02:37:41,149
He shrugs and pulls off across the lake.

2349
02:37:41,149 --> 02:37:44,500
Yeah, sorry about that.

2350
02:37:44,500 --> 02:37:46,040
Explore inland.

2351
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:53,350
You leave the shoreline and head inland.

2352
02:37:53,350 --> 02:37:55,590
You circle the shoreline of the island

2353
02:37:55,590 --> 02:37:58,430
to the north as you climb your way up the rising stones.

2354
02:37:58,430 --> 02:38:01,840
The surfaces are slippery with thick moss and vegetation.

2355
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:04,079
Suddenly, your easy pace is interrupted

2356
02:38:04,079 --> 02:38:07,709
by a cry from somewhere inland.

2357
02:38:07,709 --> 02:38:09,430
Listen.

2358
02:38:09,430 --> 02:38:10,670
You stop to listen.

2359
02:38:10,670 --> 02:38:12,389
It is a human voice.

2360
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:15,940
You make out two words.

2361
02:38:15,940 --> 02:38:18,989
Wait.

2362
02:38:18,989 --> 02:38:20,579
Keep listening.

2363
02:38:20,579 --> 02:38:22,760
You make no more movements,

2364
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:25,840
not wanting to give away your presence.

2365
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:28,360
Stay away, Annalander.

2366
02:38:28,360 --> 02:38:29,520
Stay back.

2367
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:32,090
Don't come closer.

2368
02:38:32,090 --> 02:38:33,049
You hesitate on the rock.

2369
02:38:33,049 --> 02:38:39,020
Surely this is a trap.

2370
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:43,159
Annalander, he knows who I am.

2371
02:38:43,159 --> 02:38:47,840
Approach the voice.

2372
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:51,309
The voice's whimpering and dire cries continue.

2373
02:38:51,309 --> 02:38:53,149
You climb further around the island,

2374
02:38:53,149 --> 02:38:54,909
a little higher at every step

2375
02:38:54,909 --> 02:38:57,360
until you reach the island's peak.

2376
02:38:57,360 --> 02:38:59,600
But as you approach, you realize

2377
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:06,040
it is the lip of some kind of pit.

2378
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:16,340
I mean, sense danger is easy.

2379
02:39:16,340 --> 02:39:19,629
But read minds?

2380
02:39:19,629 --> 02:39:28,290
Is somebody close enough to read minds?

2381
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:29,250
Big is always useful,

2382
02:39:29,250 --> 02:39:31,809
but I feel like I don't want to give my presence away.

2383
02:39:31,809 --> 02:39:36,110
Tell is free.

2384
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:45,309
We'll see if anyone's close enough to read the minds.

2385
02:39:45,309 --> 02:39:46,870
Removing the skullcap from your bag,

2386
02:39:46,870 --> 02:39:48,549
you cast your enchantment.

2387
02:39:48,549 --> 02:39:51,110
Reaching out with your mind,

2388
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:54,329
you detect the faintest sense of a nearby creature.

2389
02:39:54,329 --> 02:39:56,530
The voice is not an illusion,

2390
02:39:56,530 --> 02:39:58,559
nor a mimicking creature,

2391
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:01,239
but a true human intelligence.

2392
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,120
But it is very faint now,

2393
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:08,950
and must be close to the point of sleep or death.

2394
02:40:08,950 --> 02:40:11,670
Reassure the creature.

2395
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:15,040
You reach out with your mind to reassure the creature.

2396
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,079
The presence of your thoughts seems only to make

2397
02:40:17,079 --> 02:40:20,170
its pleas more panic-stricken.

2398
02:40:20,170 --> 02:40:24,889
Stay away, please stay back.

2399
02:40:24,889 --> 02:40:37,120
Hmm, climb to the pit's edge.

2400
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:38,000
You clamor upwards,

2401
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,680
the voice does not stop its constant warning.

2402
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:43,649
Between sobs, it calls.

2403
02:40:43,649 --> 02:40:45,809
Annalander, stay back.

2404
02:40:45,809 --> 02:40:48,049
Come no closer, please.

2405
02:40:48,729 --> 02:40:54,719
Stay away, stay away, no.

2406
02:40:54,719 --> 02:40:57,200
You clamor up and over the edge of the stony pit.

2407
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:00,979
There is a single bare tree at the pit's heart,

2408
02:41:00,979 --> 02:41:03,899
but tied to the tree, head slumped forward,

2409
02:41:03,899 --> 02:41:05,790
is a sight master.

2410
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:08,879
His eyes are shut, but he still calls out.

2411
02:41:08,879 --> 02:41:13,719
Stay away, stay away.

2412
02:41:13,719 --> 02:41:15,239
What is the danger?

2413
02:41:15,239 --> 02:41:16,920
You call from the edge of the clearing,

2414
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:19,290
not quite daring to approach.

2415
02:41:19,290 --> 02:41:20,889
The sight master sobs in reply,

2416
02:41:20,889 --> 02:41:23,079
his eyes still firmly shut.

2417
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:25,760
Please, just stay away.

2418
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:32,120
Leave, leave me.

2419
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:35,149
Tell me more so I may defend myself.

2420
02:41:35,149 --> 02:41:36,840
I'm gonna look around.

2421
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:38,889
I'm gonna just look.

2422
02:41:38,889 --> 02:41:42,469
I will not leave you.

2423
02:41:42,469 --> 02:41:45,399
I will not leave you.

2424
02:41:45,399 --> 02:41:47,520
The sight master stops short in his crying

2425
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:49,659
and tilts his head.

2426
02:41:49,659 --> 02:41:52,260
Is that you?

2427
02:41:52,260 --> 02:41:54,979
Annalander, is that you?

2428
02:41:54,979 --> 02:41:57,600
You recognize his voice, of course.

2429
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:01,559
This is none other than the sergeant at arms from Annaland,

2430
02:42:01,559 --> 02:42:05,250
who spied the path ahead for you when you crossed the wall.

2431
02:42:05,290 --> 02:42:13,979
He has none of his magnificent strength about him now.

2432
02:42:13,979 --> 02:42:16,739
It is I, you murmur.

2433
02:42:16,739 --> 02:42:20,840
The sight master shakes his horned helmet in despair.

2434
02:42:20,840 --> 02:42:22,760
You should not have come.

2435
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:24,780
I tried to shout.

2436
02:42:24,780 --> 02:42:29,809
I hoped you would turn back if you heard me.

2437
02:42:29,809 --> 02:42:32,500
What is the danger?

2438
02:42:32,500 --> 02:42:35,659
The sight master's body racks with a sudden pain.

2439
02:42:35,659 --> 02:42:40,479
Oh, Annalander, how I long to look upon your face.

2440
02:42:40,479 --> 02:42:46,159
You will be of great comfort to me.

2441
02:42:46,159 --> 02:42:47,680
What happened to you?

2442
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,930
You ask horrified.

2443
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:53,280
The sight master shakes his head pitifully.

2444
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:57,129
His eyes, you notice, are still firmly closed.

2445
02:42:57,129 --> 02:43:05,639
The worst thing that can be done to such as I, he murmurs.

2446
02:43:05,639 --> 02:43:10,479
I'm going to cut your bonds, you tell him.

2447
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:15,729
Do so, but do so quickly and then run.

2448
02:43:15,729 --> 02:43:19,219
I have kept my eyes shut for seven days.

2449
02:43:19,219 --> 02:43:21,299
You cannot imagine the pain of it.

2450
02:43:21,299 --> 02:43:25,280
I cannot keep them close for much longer.

2451
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:28,600
What happens if you open them?

2452
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:32,329
You perhaps know of the red eyes of Kare,

2453
02:43:32,329 --> 02:43:34,590
if I open these lids.

2454
02:43:34,590 --> 02:43:39,079
What is behind them will burn everything they see,

2455
02:43:39,079 --> 02:43:43,450
but I am a sight master.

2456
02:43:43,450 --> 02:43:45,170
You hurry over to the man and slice through the bonds

2457
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:47,479
that hold his arms against the tree.

2458
02:43:47,479 --> 02:43:50,540
The archmage knew you would come this way.

2459
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:53,510
He knew you would search the islands on your journey.

2460
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:58,440
I am not the only trap that awaits you.

2461
02:43:58,440 --> 02:44:03,229
You must tell me what you know.

2462
02:44:03,229 --> 02:44:04,069
He gulps.

2463
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:08,159
I'm gonna puke.

2464
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:10,930
Beware the other islands.

2465
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:15,190
For one waits the most powerful of the seven serpents,

2466
02:44:15,190 --> 02:44:18,520
the serpent of time himself.

2467
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:22,180
Beware, he means to kill you.

2468
02:44:22,180 --> 02:44:23,500
Cover, don't open your eyes.

2469
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:24,340
Don't look at me.

2470
02:44:24,340 --> 02:44:28,559
I don't want to burn.

2471
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:31,920
Cover his eyes.

2472
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:33,120
Should I?

2473
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:35,020
Cover his eyes.

2474
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:37,180
Quickly, you tear a strip of cloth from his cloak

2475
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:39,760
and bind it around his eyes.

2476
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:42,510
But the sight master shakes his head.

2477
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:45,719
My eyes carry the power of the under earth.

2478
02:44:45,719 --> 02:44:48,649
A mere strip of cloth will do nothing.

2479
02:44:48,649 --> 02:44:51,579
Run, Annalander, run.

2480
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:55,270
Remember, I can see far.

2481
02:44:55,270 --> 02:44:59,469
His freed hands are lifting to rub his face.

2482
02:44:59,469 --> 02:45:03,870
How can I defeat the time serpent?

2483
02:45:03,870 --> 02:45:05,709
I do not think he can be defeated

2484
02:45:05,709 --> 02:45:08,360
for he is faster than time itself.

2485
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:10,159
I heard Batman say this.

2486
02:45:10,159 --> 02:45:13,510
Stay away from him, Annalander.

2487
02:45:13,510 --> 02:45:17,139
Birdman said this.

2488
02:45:17,139 --> 02:45:19,540
Help him stand.

2489
02:45:19,540 --> 02:45:21,950
You helped the weakened figure to his feet.

2490
02:45:21,950 --> 02:45:23,709
Hard to believe this is the same creature

2491
02:45:23,709 --> 02:45:26,270
who all but bested you with his staff

2492
02:45:26,270 --> 02:45:28,030
back in the training grounds.

2493
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:30,200
He is now nothing but a shadow.

2494
02:45:30,200 --> 02:45:33,649
He squeezes your arm, perhaps thinking of similar times.

2495
02:45:33,649 --> 02:45:36,989
Then he grips the tree to support himself.

2496
02:45:36,989 --> 02:45:39,620
Go now.

2497
02:45:39,620 --> 02:45:41,930
You clasp his shoulder once,

2498
02:45:41,930 --> 02:45:44,969
then turn and scramble away down the stony gully.

2499
02:45:44,969 --> 02:45:48,510
The sight master's gasping breath echoes after you.

2500
02:45:48,510 --> 02:45:52,739
You head back to the shore.

2501
02:45:52,739 --> 02:45:57,319
Fly, you fools.

2502
02:45:57,319 --> 02:46:00,690
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

2503
02:46:00,690 --> 02:46:02,719
Yeah, that's what I figured.

2504
02:46:02,719 --> 02:46:05,909
Uh-huh.

2505
02:46:05,909 --> 02:46:11,469
I can't believe he knew Batman.

2506
02:46:11,469 --> 02:46:19,590
Back to the shore.

2507
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:21,329
You return to the shore of the lake.

2508
02:46:21,329 --> 02:46:24,020
The pole with the bell marks the edge of the water.

2509
02:46:24,020 --> 02:46:25,780
The sight master's desperate whimpering

2510
02:46:25,780 --> 02:46:29,340
is carried to you for just a moment on the breeze.

2511
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:32,139
Black gloomy clouds roll across the sky,

2512
02:46:32,139 --> 02:46:34,750
flowing from the east.

2513
02:46:34,750 --> 02:46:37,389
I don't wanna jump in the water.

2514
02:46:37,389 --> 02:46:40,059
Jump into the water?

2515
02:46:40,059 --> 02:46:43,799
Where's the bell?

2516
02:46:43,799 --> 02:46:47,079
I need to ring the bell.

2517
02:46:47,079 --> 02:46:48,719
Should I just eat all of my food?

2518
02:46:48,719 --> 02:46:50,719
It's gonna get ruined.

2519
02:46:50,719 --> 02:46:56,649
I took too long?

2520
02:46:56,649 --> 02:46:59,850
I need to eat, all my food is gonna,

2521
02:46:59,850 --> 02:47:08,030
I have to eat all my food.

2522
02:47:08,030 --> 02:47:12,750
Is all of your food perishable?

2523
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:21,750
I spent like 50 bucks on all this.

2524
02:47:21,750 --> 02:47:23,840
What gets ruined?

2525
02:47:23,840 --> 02:47:25,719
All right, let me see if it gets ruined so I can eat it.

2526
02:47:25,719 --> 02:47:27,719
I'm gonna jump in the water.

2527
02:47:27,719 --> 02:47:29,409
Let me see what actually gets ruined.

2528
02:47:29,409 --> 02:47:33,879
Jump in the water.

2529
02:47:33,879 --> 02:47:34,920
Wouldn't, what?

2530
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:36,959
Hold on.

2531
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:38,920
Once again, your fragile possessions are ruined,

2532
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:42,360
including the goblin's precious parchment.

2533
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,309
Your spell book is getting soggy,

2534
02:47:44,309 --> 02:47:47,680
but all your soft food has been ruined.

2535
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:53,760
Do I still need that?

2536
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:54,680
It's all the fruit.

2537
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:56,760
Okay, I have to eat all the fruit.

2538
02:47:56,760 --> 02:48:03,620
Wait, what?

2539
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:08,159
Hold on.

2540
02:48:08,159 --> 02:48:17,520
How far back do I need to rewind?

2541
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:19,159
Rewind and don't ring the bell.

2542
02:48:19,159 --> 02:48:21,010
Oh, that was ages ago.

2543
02:48:21,010 --> 02:48:22,090
Don't ring the bell.

2544
02:48:22,090 --> 02:48:26,649
Rewind, ow, my chest.

2545
02:48:27,090 --> 02:48:28,510
Ow, that fucking hurt.

2546
02:48:28,510 --> 02:48:37,190
Ow, shit.

2547
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:42,459
Okay, I'm good.

2548
02:48:42,459 --> 02:48:48,190
I'm all right, I'm all right.

2549
02:48:48,190 --> 02:48:49,870
I rang the bell, he comes to the shore

2550
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:50,709
and he's like, what do you want?

2551
02:48:50,709 --> 02:48:51,549
I'm like, leave.

2552
02:48:51,549 --> 02:48:59,850
And then he leaves and now I have to rewind like 30 minutes.

2553
02:48:59,850 --> 02:49:03,489
How far back?

2554
02:49:03,489 --> 02:49:04,489
An island.

2555
02:49:04,489 --> 02:49:05,329
God damn it.

2556
02:49:05,329 --> 02:49:09,139
Well, we'll just do it all over again.

2557
02:49:09,139 --> 02:49:10,739
This time don't ring the bell.

2558
02:49:10,739 --> 02:49:13,520
Explore.

2559
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:18,889
We'll speed run it.

2560
02:49:18,889 --> 02:49:20,469
Okay, listen.

2561
02:49:20,469 --> 02:49:22,809
Sight master, listening.

2562
02:49:22,809 --> 02:49:24,620
Okay, this is a trap.

2563
02:49:24,620 --> 02:49:28,920
Don't come over here.

2564
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:32,010
Okay, climb to the pit's edge.

2565
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:35,899
Stay away.

2566
02:49:35,899 --> 02:49:36,739
Yep.

2567
02:49:36,739 --> 02:49:38,850
What's the danger?

2568
02:49:38,850 --> 02:49:40,030
Look around.

2569
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:41,670
Tell me so I can defend myself.

2570
02:49:41,670 --> 02:49:43,549
Yep, this is the sergeant at arms.

2571
02:49:43,549 --> 02:49:45,719
It is I.

2572
02:49:45,719 --> 02:49:46,559
What's the danger?

2573
02:49:46,559 --> 02:49:49,200
Let me cut your bones.

2574
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:50,399
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2575
02:49:52,229 --> 02:49:53,270
What happened to you?

2576
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:57,479
I'm gonna cut your bones.

2577
02:49:57,479 --> 02:49:59,020
Do so quickly.

2578
02:49:59,020 --> 02:50:00,579
What happens if you open them?

2579
02:50:00,579 --> 02:50:04,500
The red eyes of Kare.

2580
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:06,909
Okay, tell me what you know.

2581
02:50:06,909 --> 02:50:07,750
What do you know?

2582
02:50:07,750 --> 02:50:09,969
How do I defeat the time serpent?

2583
02:50:09,969 --> 02:50:10,889
Okay, yep.

2584
02:50:10,889 --> 02:50:15,639
Okay, cover his eyes.

2585
02:50:15,639 --> 02:50:17,340
He says, doesn't matter.

2586
02:50:17,340 --> 02:50:19,799
Okay, help him stand.

2587
02:50:19,799 --> 02:50:22,750
Go now.

2588
02:50:22,750 --> 02:50:26,200
We're good.

2589
02:50:26,200 --> 02:50:30,030
Back to the shore.

2590
02:50:30,030 --> 02:50:31,670
Look at, that's, God damn it.

2591
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:34,649
Okay, look at the bell.

2592
02:50:34,649 --> 02:50:38,379
Ring the bell.

2593
02:50:38,379 --> 02:50:39,299
You again?

2594
02:50:39,299 --> 02:50:41,879
Okay, yes, get aboard.

2595
02:50:41,879 --> 02:50:42,959
You clamber into the boat

2596
02:50:42,959 --> 02:50:46,969
and the ferryman pushes you away from shore.

2597
02:50:46,969 --> 02:50:51,639
Let's continue.

2598
02:50:51,639 --> 02:50:54,520
The ferryman whistles tunelessly as he rows.

2599
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:57,790
The sun has almost set and the sky has turned a deep purple.

2600
02:50:57,790 --> 02:50:59,440
It will be dark soon.

2601
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:00,399
From the island at your back,

2602
02:51:00,399 --> 02:51:03,530
there is a sudden violent scream.

2603
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:08,790
You look up to see a flash of flame rising into the sky.

2604
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:10,899
The sight master.

2605
02:51:10,899 --> 02:51:13,500
It would seem the sight master chose to look down

2606
02:51:13,500 --> 02:51:15,510
when he opened his eyes.

2607
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:24,219
You travel for a moment in silence.

2608
02:51:24,219 --> 02:51:27,399
What can you tell me of the seven serpents?

2609
02:51:27,399 --> 02:51:28,719
The seven serpents?

2610
02:51:28,719 --> 02:51:29,559
Hmm.

2611
02:51:29,559 --> 02:51:30,979
Well, there are seven of them.

2612
02:51:30,979 --> 02:51:35,610
But there's only one you need to worry about.

2613
02:51:35,610 --> 02:51:37,479
Which one?

2614
02:51:37,479 --> 02:51:39,750
You'll see soon enough.

2615
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:42,479
His expression is distant and glazed over.

2616
02:51:42,479 --> 02:51:44,079
He has stopped lifting the oars

2617
02:51:44,079 --> 02:51:45,600
and yet the boat still moves onwards

2618
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:50,420
across the water as though compelled.

2619
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:52,959
What is moving this boat?

2620
02:51:52,959 --> 02:51:54,540
There is no reply.

2621
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:56,549
He does not seem to have heard you.

2622
02:51:56,549 --> 02:52:00,420
His face is static and unmoving.

2623
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:01,579
Shake him.

2624
02:52:01,620 --> 02:52:03,500
You reach over and shake his arm.

2625
02:52:03,500 --> 02:52:05,940
The ferryman's mouth falls open.

2626
02:52:05,940 --> 02:52:09,389
A curious hissing sound emerges.

2627
02:52:09,389 --> 02:52:10,469
Jump overboard.

2628
02:52:10,469 --> 02:52:11,309
Help him.

2629
02:52:11,309 --> 02:52:12,149
Help him.

2630
02:52:12,149 --> 02:52:14,670
You reach out to catch him as his body slumps sideways

2631
02:52:14,670 --> 02:52:17,639
and a plume of thick smoke emerges from between his teeth.

2632
02:52:17,639 --> 02:52:19,719
His body remains in place for a moment

2633
02:52:19,719 --> 02:52:21,920
and collapses like a limp sack,

2634
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:25,600
slithering into the bottom of the boat.

2635
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:26,879
Oh shit.

2636
02:52:31,590 --> 02:52:34,489
Look at the ferryman.

2637
02:52:34,489 --> 02:52:35,969
You bend down towards the ferryman.

2638
02:52:35,969 --> 02:52:38,569
Nothing remains but for a pile of clothing.

2639
02:52:38,569 --> 02:52:40,969
A swirling creature overhead becomes agitated

2640
02:52:40,969 --> 02:52:43,610
and starts to flicker and waft in your face.

2641
02:52:43,610 --> 02:52:46,450
Its gas is choking and noxious.

2642
02:52:46,450 --> 02:52:56,450
There was a choking smell filling your nostrils.

2643
02:52:56,450 --> 02:53:01,370
Uh, the gale horn is so useful.

2644
02:53:01,370 --> 02:53:07,680
I'm using it.

2645
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:10,120
Oh, wait, what?

2646
02:53:10,120 --> 02:53:13,159
You gather the starlight into alignment around you,

2647
02:53:13,159 --> 02:53:16,479
raising the horn to your mouth and playing a loud tone.

2648
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:19,719
The creature, the air serpent itself,

2649
02:53:19,719 --> 02:53:21,319
struggles to hold itself together

2650
02:53:21,319 --> 02:53:23,840
in the face of the blast of wind from the horn,

2651
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:25,600
but it cannot manage it.

2652
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:29,649
A moment later, it has been blown quite literally

2653
02:53:29,649 --> 02:53:32,750
to smithereens and all is quiet.

2654
02:53:32,750 --> 02:53:35,729
The boat rocks twice then falls silent.

2655
02:53:35,729 --> 02:53:39,770
You have now defeated five of the seven serpents.

2656
02:53:39,770 --> 02:53:41,010
Time to resume your journey.

2657
02:53:41,010 --> 02:53:45,049
Only two more remain at large.

2658
02:53:45,049 --> 02:53:48,360
Oh shit.

2659
02:53:48,360 --> 02:53:54,639
So, where's the water serpent?

2660
02:53:54,639 --> 02:53:59,049
Rip bozo.

2661
02:53:59,049 --> 02:54:04,590
Air serpent lost to air.

2662
02:54:04,590 --> 02:54:09,959
All right, I'm going on the lake.

2663
02:54:12,379 --> 02:54:15,719
You'll see soon enough.

2664
02:54:15,719 --> 02:54:19,440
I have like fucking three little pigs this guy

2665
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:22,719
and he's just gone.

2666
02:54:22,719 --> 02:54:27,440
Like, hey, motherfucker lost to a fairy tale.

2667
02:54:27,440 --> 02:54:28,399
Uh, I gotta pee.

2668
02:54:28,399 --> 02:57:50,159
I'll be right back.

2669
02:57:50,159 --> 02:57:53,290
I'm back, hi.

2670
02:57:53,290 --> 02:57:58,959
Hello, uh, let's keep going.

2671
02:58:11,750 --> 02:58:13,790
Why did you sound so sad?

2672
02:58:13,790 --> 02:58:15,989
I'm trying to do this thing when I come back from BRBs

2673
02:58:15,989 --> 02:58:19,879
where I talk very like quietly

2674
02:58:19,879 --> 02:58:22,430
because with a microphone compressor,

2675
02:58:22,430 --> 02:58:23,870
if I talk, it just, whoa, I'm here again.

2676
02:58:24,110 --> 02:58:27,329
Loud person talking.

2677
02:58:27,329 --> 02:58:29,909
Okay, another night begins.

2678
02:58:29,909 --> 02:58:31,430
You should find a place to sleep,

2679
02:58:31,430 --> 02:58:34,530
especially after rowing all day without eating.

2680
02:58:34,530 --> 02:58:36,930
You, hold on, I see a lot of people

2681
02:58:36,930 --> 02:58:39,209
just taking their seats right now.

2682
02:58:39,209 --> 02:58:41,649
Yeah, I see the, sitting in the theater,

2683
02:58:41,649 --> 02:58:44,590
but we got a lot of people coming in.

2684
02:58:44,590 --> 02:58:46,469
Yeah, I'm really apologize about the line

2685
02:58:46,469 --> 02:58:48,399
at the concession stand,

2686
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:51,399
but it's, we'll wait for people to sit down.

2687
02:58:56,450 --> 02:59:06,030
All right, I think enough of you is sitting down now.

2688
02:59:06,030 --> 02:59:08,200
You stole my seat.

2689
02:59:08,200 --> 02:59:11,909
I'm on the stage.

2690
02:59:11,950 --> 02:59:13,510
You're supposed to be on the stage.

2691
02:59:18,049 --> 02:59:21,520
Classroom?

2692
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:22,680
All right, let's go.

2693
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:24,040
You pull on the oars,

2694
02:59:24,040 --> 02:59:28,959
sliding forwards through the water.

2695
02:59:28,959 --> 02:59:30,040
I'm serpents here.

2696
02:59:31,829 --> 02:59:39,799
Let's check out this little hut house or whatever it is.

2697
02:59:39,799 --> 02:59:41,959
You row the boat onwards across the water.

2698
02:59:41,959 --> 02:59:44,159
The first few stars appear.

2699
02:59:44,159 --> 02:59:47,819
Every stroke is hard through the strange, thick water.

2700
02:59:47,819 --> 02:59:49,690
You pause for a moment.

2701
02:59:49,690 --> 02:59:56,319
Several yards ahead, the water is bubbling upwards.

2702
02:59:56,319 --> 02:59:59,040
Approach it.

2703
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:03,299
Cautiously, you scald towards the frothing water.

2704
03:00:03,299 --> 03:00:04,979
Closer in, you start to notice that

2705
03:00:04,979 --> 03:00:07,909
as each bubble breaks on the surface,

2706
03:00:07,909 --> 03:00:10,520
there is a sickly smell.

2707
03:00:10,520 --> 03:00:15,010
Inhale it.

2708
03:00:15,010 --> 03:00:17,790
Look down or move away.

2709
03:00:17,790 --> 03:00:19,350
I mean, why would I do that?

2710
03:00:19,350 --> 03:00:21,370
Inhale.

2711
03:00:21,370 --> 03:00:22,770
You inhale cautiously.

2712
03:00:22,770 --> 03:00:25,290
The smell makes your stomach turn,

2713
03:00:25,290 --> 03:00:27,170
but somehow also fills your nostrils

2714
03:00:27,170 --> 03:00:30,360
with a heady, warm glow.

2715
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:34,489
You feel giddy and uplifted.

2716
03:00:34,489 --> 03:00:40,629
I don't think we do this a second time.

2717
03:00:40,629 --> 03:00:42,309
The second time is I'll,

2718
03:00:42,309 --> 03:00:43,149
I'm gonna do it again

2719
03:00:43,149 --> 03:00:47,370
and just fucking pass out into the water.

2720
03:00:47,370 --> 03:00:50,930
No, I'm moving on.

2721
03:00:50,930 --> 03:00:52,969
Contentedly, you lift your oars once more

2722
03:00:52,969 --> 03:00:56,010
and move away from the heavy, through the heavy water.

2723
03:00:56,010 --> 03:00:57,450
Once a few furlongs distant,

2724
03:00:57,450 --> 03:01:01,760
you look back and see the bubbles have ceased.

2725
03:01:01,760 --> 03:01:04,250
Wait a little longer.

2726
03:01:04,250 --> 03:01:06,389
You wait a little longer, but nothing changes.

2727
03:01:06,389 --> 03:01:12,940
Seems whatever was here truly has moved on.

2728
03:01:12,940 --> 03:01:14,700
Middle of the lake or,

2729
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,540
let's go near the island.

2730
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:16,379
I wanna see what this is.

2731
03:01:16,379 --> 03:01:20,799
I forget what this is.

2732
03:01:20,799 --> 03:01:22,879
You row the boat onwards across the river.

2733
03:01:22,879 --> 03:01:24,319
The oars draw whirls and ripples

2734
03:01:24,319 --> 03:01:26,440
in the surface of the lake with every stroke.

2735
03:01:26,440 --> 03:01:31,489
You've come into sight of a small island.

2736
03:01:31,489 --> 03:01:34,829
This dude was huffing shark farts.

2737
03:01:34,829 --> 03:01:37,780
That gave me too stamina.

2738
03:01:37,780 --> 03:01:39,940
Okay, you roll the boat onwards across the water

2739
03:01:39,940 --> 03:01:41,260
and pull it up on the shore.

2740
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:43,319
More stars come out.

2741
03:01:43,319 --> 03:01:46,530
Get out of the boat.

2742
03:01:46,530 --> 03:01:49,010
There is no way to cross the water in the dark

2743
03:01:49,010 --> 03:01:52,120
and exploring inland would be unwise.

2744
03:01:52,120 --> 03:01:53,870
You will have to rest here.

2745
03:01:53,870 --> 03:01:55,430
Unstrapping your pack on the shore of the lake,

2746
03:01:55,430 --> 03:01:57,790
you try to stretch out despite the wind.

2747
03:01:57,790 --> 03:02:00,530
You've eaten nothing today.

2748
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:02,670
Eat something.

2749
03:02:02,670 --> 03:02:04,110
Removing one of your grilled fish,

2750
03:02:04,110 --> 03:02:05,709
you break your fast.

2751
03:02:05,709 --> 03:02:09,899
And you lie back and try to forget your troubles.

2752
03:02:09,899 --> 03:02:12,920
You dream you are trapped in a low straw hut.

2753
03:02:12,920 --> 03:02:16,110
Its doors seal the bolts made of bones.

2754
03:02:16,110 --> 03:02:18,149
A small fire is burning in one corner

2755
03:02:18,149 --> 03:02:21,639
but quickly spreads until you are surrounded by flame.

2756
03:02:21,639 --> 03:02:24,450
You feel yourself starting to sweat from the heat.

2757
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:26,040
Wake up.

2758
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:27,920
You wake up and find a ball of fire

2759
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:31,950
raging mere inches from you.

2760
03:02:31,950 --> 03:02:34,500
Look at it.

2761
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:37,430
Oh, it's a Firefox.

2762
03:02:37,430 --> 03:02:39,190
The fire does not seem to be fueled.

2763
03:02:39,190 --> 03:02:41,430
It is a ball about three feet wide

2764
03:02:41,430 --> 03:02:44,440
gushing with smoke and steam.

2765
03:02:44,440 --> 03:02:46,399
A moment later, it unravels on curling

2766
03:02:46,399 --> 03:02:48,639
into a long animal form.

2767
03:02:48,639 --> 03:02:51,790
It is a Firefox and it is coming for your neck

2768
03:02:51,790 --> 03:02:56,389
in a blaze of fur and fire.

2769
03:03:00,010 --> 03:03:14,379
Return the tooth.

2770
03:03:14,379 --> 03:03:18,809
Use Huff again.

2771
03:03:18,809 --> 03:03:20,729
I can't, I don't have access to it.

2772
03:03:23,479 --> 03:03:24,899
I think I have to fight it.

2773
03:03:24,899 --> 03:03:26,870
Every time I've tried to talk.

2774
03:03:26,870 --> 03:03:30,840
Oh no, this is Raz.

2775
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:33,989
I'm just gonna fight it.

2776
03:03:33,989 --> 03:03:34,829
I'll make a shield.

2777
03:03:34,829 --> 03:03:36,489
It's one gold piece.

2778
03:03:36,489 --> 03:03:40,510
I got plenty of money.

2779
03:03:40,510 --> 03:03:42,979
I'm glad I did that.

2780
03:03:42,979 --> 03:03:44,700
Place a gold piece on your wrist and cast the spell

2781
03:03:44,700 --> 03:03:46,700
and a moment later, the coin is gone.

2782
03:03:46,700 --> 03:03:49,729
You feel the weight of an invisible shield on your arm.

2783
03:03:49,729 --> 03:03:51,129
And it is upon you.

2784
03:03:51,129 --> 03:03:53,010
You draw your sword and keep your shield high

2785
03:03:53,010 --> 03:03:55,870
ready to fight.

2786
03:03:55,870 --> 03:03:58,000
We're going all in.

2787
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,159
Oh, that was a huge mistake on your part

2788
03:04:00,159 --> 03:04:03,110
for doing that.

2789
03:04:03,110 --> 03:04:04,790
Firefox paces the earth before you,

2790
03:04:04,790 --> 03:04:07,469
sparks of fire flashing across its fur.

2791
03:04:07,469 --> 03:04:10,469
Driven by fear, you charge headlong.

2792
03:04:10,469 --> 03:04:12,909
It rushes you, falling up and igniting

2793
03:04:12,909 --> 03:04:14,309
as it flies through the air.

2794
03:04:14,309 --> 03:04:16,790
Only to skewer itself on your blade.

2795
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:18,190
It twists and rides.

2796
03:04:18,190 --> 03:04:20,110
It limps back bleeding heavily.

2797
03:04:20,110 --> 03:04:21,229
Dark blue flames,

2798
03:04:21,229 --> 03:04:24,280
gutter between clumps of ragged fur.

2799
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:27,069
The monster crouches down and snarls.

2800
03:04:27,069 --> 03:04:32,819
All in again.

2801
03:04:32,819 --> 03:04:35,239
Okay.

2802
03:04:35,239 --> 03:04:38,090
The blow catches the Firefox as it dodges back.

2803
03:04:38,090 --> 03:04:40,889
As the Firefox grows weaker,

2804
03:04:40,889 --> 03:04:42,309
its eyes grow redder,

2805
03:04:42,309 --> 03:04:45,459
but its fur begins to turn ash gray.

2806
03:04:45,459 --> 03:04:48,420
Firefox's eyes flash a deep hot red.

2807
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:50,020
Uh-huh.

2808
03:04:50,020 --> 03:04:53,360
No thanks.

2809
03:04:53,360 --> 03:04:55,399
The slavering beast charges for your throat,

2810
03:04:55,399 --> 03:04:56,639
but you react fast,

2811
03:04:56,639 --> 03:04:58,809
dropping down behind your shield.

2812
03:04:58,809 --> 03:05:00,229
But even the shield cannot protect you

2813
03:05:00,229 --> 03:05:01,850
from the blast of its heat.

2814
03:05:01,850 --> 03:05:03,049
Even with your shield,

2815
03:05:03,049 --> 03:05:04,129
you are badly burned.

2816
03:05:04,129 --> 03:05:06,979
Oh, it's...

2817
03:05:06,979 --> 03:05:07,979
Okay.

2818
03:05:07,979 --> 03:05:12,649
It's fire.

2819
03:05:12,649 --> 03:05:16,139
Firefox snatch, scratches at its fur.

2820
03:05:16,139 --> 03:05:18,149
Falling.

2821
03:05:18,149 --> 03:05:21,309
Sorry.

2822
03:05:21,309 --> 03:05:22,950
You turn your blade for a vicious attack,

2823
03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:25,790
but your sword cannot reach the Firefox before it leaps.

2824
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:27,649
It howls and whimpers.

2825
03:05:27,649 --> 03:05:30,399
Again.

2826
03:05:30,399 --> 03:05:31,219
Defend all you want.

2827
03:05:31,219 --> 03:05:35,069
I'm slowly chipping away.

2828
03:05:35,069 --> 03:05:35,909
Okay.

2829
03:05:36,670 --> 03:05:37,510
Okay.

2830
03:05:37,510 --> 03:05:38,350
Defend, defend.

2831
03:05:38,350 --> 03:05:43,010
Yeah.

2832
03:05:43,010 --> 03:05:44,010
The Firefox runs for your neck.

2833
03:05:44,010 --> 03:05:46,370
You fling your shield up and knock it away.

2834
03:05:46,370 --> 03:05:50,209
Creature crouches low and growls.

2835
03:05:50,209 --> 03:05:52,670
Well, you can't do very much.

2836
03:05:52,670 --> 03:05:53,549
You just did 6.6.

2837
03:05:53,549 --> 03:05:57,600
That's almost all your attack power.

2838
03:05:57,600 --> 03:05:58,440
That's fine.

2839
03:05:58,440 --> 03:06:02,200
I'll just keep chipping away.

2840
03:06:02,200 --> 03:06:04,479
You bring your sword around for a wild attack,

2841
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:06,559
catches the Firefox as it moves away.

2842
03:06:06,559 --> 03:06:07,639
The beast is crawling,

2843
03:06:07,639 --> 03:06:10,639
dragging its wounded belly through the mud below.

2844
03:06:10,639 --> 03:06:13,340
Fire flickers along its back.

2845
03:06:13,340 --> 03:06:15,239
I think it's coming in hard.

2846
03:06:15,239 --> 03:06:19,469
Yeah.

2847
03:06:19,469 --> 03:06:21,680
And...

2848
03:06:21,719 --> 03:06:26,940
See you later.

2849
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:29,700
You pull all your might into a sweep of your sword,

2850
03:06:29,700 --> 03:06:31,600
hoping to finish the creature in a stroke.

2851
03:06:31,600 --> 03:06:32,620
The blow connects.

2852
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:34,559
The Firefox collapses.

2853
03:06:34,559 --> 03:06:38,309
And then a moment later ignites with a powerful flare.

2854
03:06:38,309 --> 03:06:39,469
The pyre burns.

2855
03:06:39,469 --> 03:06:41,870
For a short instant, and then when it fades,

2856
03:06:41,870 --> 03:06:52,420
the creature is tight skin around bones with no flesh left.

2857
03:06:52,420 --> 03:06:55,459
You collapse back, exhausted and scorched from the encounter.

2858
03:06:55,459 --> 03:06:58,200
With luck, the rest of the night will be more peaceful.

2859
03:06:58,200 --> 03:07:00,379
I'm gonna get a tooth out of this, right?

2860
03:07:00,379 --> 03:07:02,079
The creature has no possessions, of course,

2861
03:07:02,079 --> 03:07:04,100
but it has a fine array of teeth,

2862
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:06,260
including four front fangs

2863
03:07:06,260 --> 03:07:08,420
that seem to glow with a faint heat.

2864
03:07:08,420 --> 03:07:11,370
Take the fangs.

2865
03:07:11,370 --> 03:07:12,290
With the tip of your sword,

2866
03:07:12,290 --> 03:07:14,530
you dig out the first of the creature's fangs.

2867
03:07:14,530 --> 03:07:16,250
But as you tug it free,

2868
03:07:16,250 --> 03:07:19,920
the tooth cracks and suddenly erupts into flame.

2869
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:21,040
You drop it smartly,

2870
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:24,620
and the fire burns a moment longer before going out.

2871
03:07:24,620 --> 03:07:30,649
What is with this guy and teeth?

2872
03:07:30,649 --> 03:07:32,889
I don't think I can take them.

2873
03:07:32,889 --> 03:07:34,360
I'll try one more.

2874
03:07:34,360 --> 03:07:36,690
Remove the remaining teeth.

2875
03:07:36,690 --> 03:07:38,750
Working more carefully this time,

2876
03:07:38,750 --> 03:07:42,340
you manage to extract two more fangs without incident.

2877
03:07:42,340 --> 03:07:44,139
The third is harder work,

2878
03:07:44,139 --> 03:07:46,079
but you cut and tug carefully

2879
03:07:46,079 --> 03:07:48,799
and manage to extract it successfully.

2880
03:07:48,799 --> 03:07:51,040
You wrap the teeth in cloth and put them into your pack.

2881
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:53,680
It will come in useful should you need to light a fire,

2882
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:55,670
and tiredness overwhelms you.

2883
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:57,120
Time to rest.

2884
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:00,909
Your shield shimmers out of existence.

2885
03:08:00,909 --> 03:08:05,329
Yeah.

2886
03:08:05,329 --> 03:08:07,700
You used one provision and some gold,

2887
03:08:07,700 --> 03:08:10,450
and you collected the sun serpent and the air serpent.

2888
03:08:10,450 --> 03:08:20,370
So you have now destroyed five of the archmages' serpents.

2889
03:08:20,370 --> 03:08:31,149
Jesus Christ, who scratched the germa cd.

2890
03:08:31,149 --> 03:08:33,540
Firefox just crashed.

2891
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:36,860
Okay.

2892
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:39,549
The sun rises above the waters of the lake.

2893
03:08:39,549 --> 03:08:41,090
This island is thickly wooded,

2894
03:08:41,090 --> 03:08:42,610
but all the trees have died,

2895
03:08:42,610 --> 03:08:44,889
and the whole forest is gray and desolate.

2896
03:08:44,889 --> 03:08:47,510
By the shoreline is another pole with a bell

2897
03:08:47,510 --> 03:08:50,360
holed up in the shallows as a rowboat.

2898
03:08:50,360 --> 03:08:52,190
I know that because it's mine.

2899
03:08:52,190 --> 03:08:53,909
Black gloomy clouds roll across the,

2900
03:08:53,909 --> 03:08:56,459
you know, words that are hard to say,

2901
03:08:56,459 --> 03:08:59,420
flowing from the east.

2902
03:08:59,420 --> 03:09:02,139
Let's explore inland.

2903
03:09:02,139 --> 03:09:05,559
I wanna go in this hut.

2904
03:09:05,559 --> 03:09:09,659
Inland.

2905
03:09:09,659 --> 03:09:12,409
You head away from the shoreline into the trees.

2906
03:09:12,409 --> 03:09:13,729
You walk up the path from the shore

2907
03:09:13,729 --> 03:09:15,969
to a small clearing in a dead forest.

2908
03:09:15,969 --> 03:09:18,860
At the center is something that used to be a hut,

2909
03:09:18,860 --> 03:09:21,420
but now is just three rickety walls

2910
03:09:21,420 --> 03:09:24,209
and part of a roof.

2911
03:09:24,209 --> 03:09:25,860
Look inside.

2912
03:09:25,860 --> 03:09:28,700
Inside, an old woman is hunched over a table

2913
03:09:28,700 --> 03:09:30,260
scattered with vials,

2914
03:09:30,260 --> 03:09:33,909
broken jars and plants you don't recognize.

2915
03:09:33,909 --> 03:09:37,180
She's mixing some kind of bright green paste

2916
03:09:37,180 --> 03:09:38,780
and is so absorbed in her work,

2917
03:09:38,780 --> 03:09:43,040
she doesn't notice you.

2918
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:44,860
Approach, stay back.

2919
03:09:44,860 --> 03:09:47,809
I'm gonna stay back and watch.

2920
03:09:47,809 --> 03:09:49,170
The woman mutters to herself

2921
03:09:49,170 --> 03:09:51,170
as she steadily grinds the mixture.

2922
03:09:51,170 --> 03:09:54,250
Her white hair is in one wild clump

2923
03:09:54,250 --> 03:09:56,329
that reaches her waist.

2924
03:09:56,329 --> 03:09:58,049
She's wearing a filthy brown robe,

2925
03:09:58,049 --> 03:09:59,989
which might actually be a sack.

2926
03:09:59,989 --> 03:10:02,909
She looks up from her work to paw around the table,

2927
03:10:02,909 --> 03:10:05,799
eventually grabbing some berries and tossing them in.

2928
03:10:05,799 --> 03:10:09,309
Half of the ingredients in her rundown hut you cannot name,

2929
03:10:09,309 --> 03:10:11,620
but she appears to know what she is doing.

2930
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:16,180
She must be a healer or a witch.

2931
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:21,500
Greetings or try to sneak up on her.

2932
03:10:21,500 --> 03:10:24,959
Why, like a Hitman game?

2933
03:10:24,959 --> 03:10:28,829
There's like crouch and walk behind her.

2934
03:10:28,829 --> 03:10:33,170
Stealth kill her.

2935
03:10:33,170 --> 03:10:37,270
I always go for the greetings approach.

2936
03:10:37,270 --> 03:10:40,010
I feel like that's the best way.

2937
03:10:40,010 --> 03:10:42,549
Greetings, wise woman.

2938
03:10:42,549 --> 03:10:43,870
She squints at you,

2939
03:10:43,870 --> 03:10:48,299
sucking on her few teeth with a wet pop.

2940
03:10:48,299 --> 03:10:49,739
Hey, what?

2941
03:10:49,739 --> 03:10:51,920
Who are you?

2942
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:55,059
I'm just a traveler.

2943
03:10:55,059 --> 03:10:57,010
Well, why bother traveling out here?

2944
03:10:57,010 --> 03:11:03,659
Not much to see, should I think, besides ingredients.

2945
03:11:03,659 --> 03:11:06,620
Ingredients, you ask?

2946
03:11:06,620 --> 03:11:09,579
For my potions.

2947
03:11:09,579 --> 03:11:11,459
She says waving over her shoulder

2948
03:11:11,459 --> 03:11:14,860
at a shelf groaning with concoctions and jars.

2949
03:11:14,860 --> 03:11:16,659
These islands are brimming with herbs

2950
03:11:16,659 --> 03:11:19,430
and dirt clumps I've never seen before.

2951
03:11:19,430 --> 03:11:22,559
They probably all have a hundred uses.

2952
03:11:22,559 --> 03:11:25,120
After so long in this cruel wild,

2953
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:30,780
this woman makes for unexpectedly pleasant company.

2954
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:33,819
What is your name?

2955
03:11:33,819 --> 03:11:34,739
Uh.

2956
03:11:34,739 --> 03:11:37,049
She screws up her face.

2957
03:11:37,049 --> 03:11:42,260
You know, that's an excellent question.

2958
03:11:42,260 --> 03:11:44,889
What do your potions do?

2959
03:11:44,889 --> 03:11:46,899
I can never be sure.

2960
03:11:46,899 --> 03:11:48,420
I experiment.

2961
03:11:48,420 --> 03:11:50,899
I push the boundaries of the healing arts.

2962
03:11:50,899 --> 03:11:52,860
I've created several new recipes

2963
03:11:52,860 --> 03:11:56,030
that you won't find anywhere else.

2964
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:58,159
That sounds most interesting.

2965
03:11:58,159 --> 03:12:01,129
You must be in great demand.

2966
03:12:01,129 --> 03:12:04,280
That sounds most interesting.

2967
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:05,680
Most indeed.

2968
03:12:05,680 --> 03:12:08,260
See, I studied at the fortress, no less.

2969
03:12:08,260 --> 03:12:09,540
They were so impressed with me,

2970
03:12:09,540 --> 03:12:12,069
they suggested some independent study.

2971
03:12:12,069 --> 03:12:13,069
So that's what I've been doing,

2972
03:12:13,069 --> 03:12:17,520
alone for, uh, 47 years.

2973
03:12:17,520 --> 03:12:19,899
Uh, but aren't you curious?

2974
03:12:19,899 --> 03:12:21,299
Here, let me try something on you.

2975
03:12:21,299 --> 03:12:24,260
Uh, pick me up strong enough to get you through the lake.

2976
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:28,870
Even up the mountains, what do you say?

2977
03:12:28,870 --> 03:12:30,350
Uh.

2978
03:12:30,350 --> 03:12:34,340
What's in it, you ask, suspiciously.

2979
03:12:34,340 --> 03:12:37,579
She waves a bowl of green substance around excitedly.

2980
03:12:37,579 --> 03:12:39,500
It's a very powerful healing potion.

2981
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:41,020
You won't find this one in some market.

2982
03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:42,059
Oh, no.

2983
03:12:42,059 --> 03:12:44,219
I'm doing some experiments that are so experimental,

2984
03:12:44,219 --> 03:12:45,700
even I don't know what I've put in it.

2985
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:48,379
But there's some all-scab, flattened goblin hair,

2986
03:12:48,379 --> 03:12:49,299
a bit of unicorn meat.

2987
03:12:49,299 --> 03:12:51,850
That's mostly for flavor.

2988
03:12:51,850 --> 03:12:53,809
Goblin hair?

2989
03:12:53,809 --> 03:12:54,649
What?

2990
03:12:54,649 --> 03:12:55,610
No, I never said that.

2991
03:12:55,610 --> 03:12:59,329
Why would I put goblin hair in a healing potion?

2992
03:12:59,329 --> 03:13:01,290
That is what you said.

2993
03:13:01,290 --> 03:13:03,170
Goblin hair would be all wrong.

2994
03:13:03,170 --> 03:13:05,579
Uh, it's a cure for baldness.

2995
03:13:05,579 --> 03:13:07,100
Now, I distinctly remember telling you

2996
03:13:07,100 --> 03:13:09,260
that the potion has all-scab, catfish whiskers,

2997
03:13:09,260 --> 03:13:11,139
and levitated sand for the color.

2998
03:13:11,139 --> 03:13:14,420
So drink it.

2999
03:13:14,420 --> 03:13:23,899
Um, I drink it?

3000
03:13:23,899 --> 03:13:26,180
The potion slides down your throat.

3001
03:13:26,180 --> 03:13:29,510
Your legs begin twitching and wobbling violently.

3002
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:32,149
Every step is a frenzy of bending knees and feet

3003
03:13:32,149 --> 03:13:33,909
moving in random directions.

3004
03:13:33,909 --> 03:13:35,790
You spend a few minutes in the nearby forest

3005
03:13:35,790 --> 03:13:38,430
bashing into trees and kicking underbrush

3006
03:13:38,430 --> 03:13:41,979
before you gain control of your legs again.

3007
03:13:41,979 --> 03:13:49,079
What?

3008
03:13:49,079 --> 03:13:50,819
You return to the shore of the lake.

3009
03:13:50,819 --> 03:13:52,500
The wind makes the bell shimmer with sound.

3010
03:13:52,500 --> 03:13:54,219
The little boat is still here.

3011
03:13:54,219 --> 03:13:58,379
Return inland.

3012
03:13:58,379 --> 03:14:02,010
You move away into the thick woods that cover the island.

3013
03:14:02,010 --> 03:14:07,780
Um, we're going back.

3014
03:14:07,780 --> 03:14:10,420
You head away from the shoreline into the trees.

3015
03:14:10,420 --> 03:14:12,190
You find nothing new.

3016
03:14:12,190 --> 03:14:13,309
You head back to the shore,

3017
03:14:13,309 --> 03:14:14,870
but on your way back through the long grass,

3018
03:14:14,870 --> 03:14:18,180
you trip over something protruding from the ground.

3019
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:20,940
It's a small half-buried shrine

3020
03:14:20,940 --> 03:14:22,819
that you passed right by

3021
03:14:22,819 --> 03:14:27,340
without noticing on your way up the slope of the hill.

3022
03:14:27,340 --> 03:14:30,379
Look at the shrine.

3023
03:14:30,379 --> 03:14:33,950
You kneel to examine the tiny carved totem

3024
03:14:33,950 --> 03:14:35,229
that is barely a foot tall

3025
03:14:35,229 --> 03:14:39,709
and sculpted in a curious half-deformed human shape.

3026
03:14:39,709 --> 03:14:41,829
At least half of its length has sunk into the ground,

3027
03:14:41,829 --> 03:14:45,950
or else it is so old the ground has grown up over it.

3028
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:50,219
There's a little writing near its base, mostly obscured.

3029
03:14:50,219 --> 03:14:51,879
Bro, don't do it.

3030
03:14:51,879 --> 03:14:53,959
With the, with like the ape.

3031
03:14:53,959 --> 03:14:57,149
Ha ha ha.

3032
03:14:57,149 --> 03:14:57,989
Clear away the mud.

3033
03:14:57,989 --> 03:14:59,190
Pray at the shrine.

3034
03:14:59,190 --> 03:15:01,469
I don't know if that's a good idea.

3035
03:15:01,469 --> 03:15:04,760
Let's clear the mud away.

3036
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:06,000
You clear away a little of the mud

3037
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:07,440
around the base of the idol

3038
03:15:07,440 --> 03:15:09,430
to reveal a few characters.

3039
03:15:09,430 --> 03:15:12,569
Y, N.

3040
03:15:12,569 --> 03:15:15,290
The figure's face has been largely dissolved

3041
03:15:15,290 --> 03:15:17,020
by rain and wind.

3042
03:15:17,020 --> 03:15:24,940
Its hands are held out, but they are empty.

3043
03:15:24,940 --> 03:15:27,020
Don't betray the monkey.

3044
03:15:27,020 --> 03:15:28,540
Say no.

3045
03:15:28,540 --> 03:15:31,770
No, don't do it.

3046
03:15:31,770 --> 03:15:33,850
That lady just gave you dishwashing liquid

3047
03:15:33,850 --> 03:15:37,319
to get you out of her house.

3048
03:15:37,319 --> 03:15:39,840
Ask the ape for health and then get rid of him.

3049
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:43,620
That's so sad.

3050
03:15:43,620 --> 03:15:49,620
That seems so, so cruel in a way.

3051
03:15:49,620 --> 03:15:50,659
What do I do?

3052
03:15:50,659 --> 03:15:52,059
All right.

3053
03:15:52,059 --> 03:15:55,389
It's a, this is a chat choice here.

3054
03:15:55,389 --> 03:15:59,780
There's an opportunity to get a new god.

3055
03:15:59,780 --> 03:16:05,850
Make an offering slash pray or leave with the ape.

3056
03:16:05,850 --> 03:16:10,860
It's very important.

3057
03:16:10,860 --> 03:16:16,850
Ape gang, stay strong.

3058
03:16:16,889 --> 03:16:20,579
Make an offering, maybe get potentially new,

3059
03:16:20,579 --> 03:16:23,799
a new god, which has, all the gods are different.

3060
03:16:23,799 --> 03:16:25,200
They all have different kind of temperaments

3061
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:26,040
and different things they do

3062
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:29,420
and if they help or don't help.

3063
03:16:29,420 --> 03:16:31,860
The ape is pretty reliable, but I don't know.

3064
03:16:31,860 --> 03:16:33,190
It's up to you.

3065
03:16:33,190 --> 03:16:42,100
Could be some interesting new things to do with the new god.

3066
03:16:42,100 --> 03:16:44,829
Ape has never helped once.

3067
03:16:44,829 --> 03:16:46,870
I can think of at least two or three cases

3068
03:16:46,870 --> 03:16:58,940
where the ape has helped pretty clearly.

3069
03:16:58,940 --> 03:17:06,440
Chat seems pretty passionate about the ape.

3070
03:17:06,440 --> 03:17:09,979
I think it's just, there's a really fun emote

3071
03:17:10,620 --> 03:17:16,100
the other god doesn't have a really fun emote to do.

3072
03:17:16,100 --> 03:17:23,930
I think that's the problem here.

3073
03:17:23,930 --> 03:17:29,100
No, it's more than that.

3074
03:17:29,100 --> 03:17:31,500
49%, hold on.

3075
03:17:31,500 --> 03:17:33,959
What were the three choices?

3076
03:17:33,959 --> 03:17:38,690
One by three votes?

3077
03:17:38,690 --> 03:17:41,590
Oh, I think we need to do this again.

3078
03:17:41,590 --> 03:17:43,030
Yeah, we have to do it again.

3079
03:17:43,030 --> 03:17:48,229
Cause make offering and pray, we need to do it again.

3080
03:17:48,229 --> 03:17:54,719
Cause 25 people said pray, they wanted to leave the ape.

3081
03:17:54,719 --> 03:17:56,340
You understand what I'm saying?

3082
03:17:56,340 --> 03:18:00,680
This is, this is tech, technically,

3083
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:06,159
technically leave has 49, make offering and pray has 51%.

3084
03:18:09,190 --> 03:18:11,139
You understand?

3085
03:18:11,139 --> 03:18:13,120
We need to do it again.

3086
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:15,729
Yeah, we have to do it again.

3087
03:18:15,729 --> 03:18:18,610
Technically leaving the ape had more percentage.

3088
03:18:18,610 --> 03:18:19,530
So let's see.

3089
03:18:19,530 --> 03:18:20,969
This is your, you gotta make the choice.

3090
03:18:20,969 --> 03:18:33,299
You gotta make this choice now.

3091
03:18:33,299 --> 03:18:35,549
What about the fun emote?

3092
03:18:35,549 --> 03:18:39,180
Nah, I didn't, I'm not saying anything.

3093
03:18:39,180 --> 03:18:41,979
Either way, I think it's interesting.

3094
03:18:41,979 --> 03:18:43,260
I don't even know who this god is.

3095
03:18:43,260 --> 03:18:49,520
I'm not sure I ever did this.

3096
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:54,530
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

3097
03:18:54,530 --> 03:18:56,250
It's gonna be like 10 votes.

3098
03:18:56,250 --> 03:18:57,969
It's gonna be five to 10 votes.

3099
03:18:57,969 --> 03:18:59,489
So if you're sitting there going,

3100
03:18:59,489 --> 03:19:01,209
should I click that button right there?

3101
03:19:01,209 --> 03:19:03,569
Nah.

3102
03:19:05,299 --> 03:19:06,219
What's gonna happen?

3103
03:19:06,219 --> 03:19:12,930
It's almost over.

3104
03:19:12,930 --> 03:19:16,500
Oh, it's over.

3105
03:19:16,500 --> 03:19:17,700
We're about to leave the ape.

3106
03:19:17,700 --> 03:19:21,379
Fuck you, Jervo.

3107
03:19:21,379 --> 03:19:24,059
What?

3108
03:19:24,059 --> 03:19:28,629
I'm leaving, hey, I'm leaving this up to democracy.

3109
03:19:28,629 --> 03:19:35,870
51, 49.

3110
03:19:35,870 --> 03:19:38,790
No, no, no, no, hold on a second.

3111
03:19:38,790 --> 03:19:44,579
The first poll, the ape still did technically lose.

3112
03:19:44,579 --> 03:19:50,180
2% for pray and 49% for offering.

3113
03:19:51,610 --> 03:19:53,770
That's true, that is true.

3114
03:19:53,770 --> 03:19:55,129
I wanna see true, true, true, true.

3115
03:19:55,129 --> 03:19:58,229
I wanna see true, true, true.

3116
03:19:58,229 --> 03:19:59,829
True, true, yeah, that's true.

3117
03:19:59,829 --> 03:20:01,030
It's true, yeah, true.

3118
03:20:01,030 --> 03:20:10,770
Yep, okay, thank you, ape.

3119
03:20:10,770 --> 03:20:14,690
I'll take the full health.

3120
03:20:14,690 --> 03:20:18,340
Everyone, can we all say the ape has been with us

3121
03:20:18,340 --> 03:20:20,479
for a very long time.

3122
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:25,219
He's always good to us, always helped us,

3123
03:20:25,219 --> 03:20:27,850
always wanted to make sure we were doing all right.

3124
03:20:27,850 --> 03:20:29,450
Remember that time we were in the mine

3125
03:20:29,450 --> 03:20:33,239
and the mine collapsed and the ape held up the stones

3126
03:20:33,239 --> 03:20:35,379
before we could get us to get out?

3127
03:20:35,379 --> 03:20:37,459
Remember when we fell down the hill

3128
03:20:37,459 --> 03:20:47,899
and the ape gently, gently guided us down.

3129
03:20:47,899 --> 03:20:50,389
Thank you, ape.

3130
03:20:50,389 --> 03:20:54,989
Maybe we'll see you again another time.

3131
03:20:54,989 --> 03:20:58,489
You bend on one knee by the shrine intrigued

3132
03:20:58,489 --> 03:21:02,180
and ready to make an offering to this strange god,

3133
03:21:02,180 --> 03:21:04,129
whoever he may be.

3134
03:21:04,129 --> 03:21:06,700
As you sit, a voice enters your head

3135
03:21:06,700 --> 03:21:10,659
that you have not heard before.

3136
03:21:10,659 --> 03:21:19,639
Do you make a gift to the god of the gods?

3137
03:21:19,639 --> 03:21:23,799
What gift do you require?

3138
03:21:23,799 --> 03:21:27,170
The voice falls silent offering no answers.

3139
03:21:27,170 --> 03:21:34,180
Gold piece, food, a vial of holy water.

3140
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:39,790
Hmm, a vial of holy water.

3141
03:21:39,790 --> 03:21:42,069
You unstopper a vial of shimmering holy water

3142
03:21:42,069 --> 03:21:45,260
and pour it over the idol, bowing your head.

3143
03:21:45,260 --> 03:21:48,700
The liquid runs down the broken face like tears,

3144
03:21:48,700 --> 03:21:53,639
but nothing else occurs.

3145
03:21:53,639 --> 03:21:55,770
Offer a gold piece.

3146
03:21:55,770 --> 03:21:59,010
You place a gold piece at the base of the idol,

3147
03:21:59,010 --> 03:22:01,649
but there's no change in the carvings across its surface.

3148
03:22:01,649 --> 03:22:03,379
Nothing happens.

3149
03:22:03,379 --> 03:22:05,709
You take it back.

3150
03:22:05,709 --> 03:22:08,299
Offer food.

3151
03:22:08,299 --> 03:22:10,700
You place an item of food down at the god's feet

3152
03:22:10,700 --> 03:22:12,299
and bow your head.

3153
03:22:12,299 --> 03:22:13,819
Nothing happens.

3154
03:22:13,819 --> 03:22:15,420
You take it back.

3155
03:22:15,420 --> 03:22:18,450
Clearly you have nothing worth offering to this idol.

3156
03:22:18,450 --> 03:22:21,030
You stand once more.

3157
03:22:21,069 --> 03:22:23,870
A small corner of stone falls from the idol's back

3158
03:22:23,870 --> 03:22:27,569
to the mud below.

3159
03:22:27,569 --> 03:22:29,920
Pray at the shrine.

3160
03:22:29,920 --> 03:22:31,379
You pause to pray at the shrine,

3161
03:22:31,379 --> 03:22:34,920
but if it ever had any power, it seems to be long gone.

3162
03:22:34,920 --> 03:22:38,250
You sense nothing from the old stone.

3163
03:22:38,250 --> 03:22:43,870
You head back to the shore.

3164
03:22:43,870 --> 03:22:48,079
Hey, the ape.

3165
03:22:48,079 --> 03:22:51,120
Hey, I didn't, I didn't want to do it either.

3166
03:22:51,120 --> 03:22:53,760
I didn't want, I wasn't part of that.

3167
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:55,629
Why would we ever leave you?

3168
03:22:55,629 --> 03:22:57,370
You were super good to us.

3169
03:22:57,370 --> 03:23:01,329
It was, we were just joking around.

3170
03:23:01,329 --> 03:23:04,399
Don't take that personally.

3171
03:23:04,399 --> 03:23:06,100
What, I wonder what you need.

3172
03:23:06,100 --> 03:23:06,940
What is that?

3173
03:23:06,940 --> 03:23:12,290
What god is it?

3174
03:23:12,290 --> 03:23:14,870
Will you guys be mad at me if I rewind to get my items back?

3175
03:23:14,870 --> 03:23:21,600
Or do I, is that what I deserve?

3176
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:31,139
I think that's what I deserve.

3177
03:23:31,139 --> 03:23:36,399
You deserve it.

3178
03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:39,399
You did it wrong.

3179
03:23:39,399 --> 03:23:40,239
Rewind?

3180
03:23:40,239 --> 03:23:41,079
It's okay.

3181
03:23:41,079 --> 03:23:45,280
Wait, can I, hold on.

3182
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:47,760
I'm curious.

3183
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:50,950
Look at the shrine.

3184
03:23:50,950 --> 03:23:57,100
Clear away the mud.

3185
03:23:57,100 --> 03:24:02,149
Make an offering.

3186
03:24:02,149 --> 03:24:05,120
Do you make a gift to the god of gods?

3187
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:06,450
I do.

3188
03:24:06,450 --> 03:24:13,040
You cry.

3189
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:16,010
Clearly you have nothing worth offering to this idol.

3190
03:24:16,010 --> 03:24:17,090
You stand once more.

3191
03:24:17,090 --> 03:24:19,299
The voice intones once more.

3192
03:24:19,299 --> 03:24:25,600
Do you refuse to give a gift to the god of the gods?

3193
03:24:25,600 --> 03:24:29,360
I do.

3194
03:24:29,360 --> 03:24:30,809
You repeat.

3195
03:24:30,809 --> 03:24:34,600
Then you break your promise to your brand?

3196
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:36,299
Intones the voice.

3197
03:24:36,299 --> 03:24:38,840
I apologize.

3198
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:39,680
I do.

3199
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:42,329
Should I just keep saying I do?

3200
03:24:42,329 --> 03:24:45,139
I do.

3201
03:24:45,139 --> 03:24:47,959
You repeat for a third time.

3202
03:24:47,959 --> 03:24:51,620
Your offering of a promise broken is accepted.

3203
03:24:51,620 --> 03:24:52,979
You may follow me.

3204
03:24:52,979 --> 03:24:56,510
Fickle worthless mortal.

3205
03:24:56,510 --> 03:24:59,760
Wordlessly the ape moves away from you.

3206
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:02,659
Your mind is empty for a moment.

3207
03:25:02,659 --> 03:25:05,719
Then seems to inflate in size.

3208
03:25:05,719 --> 03:25:08,600
There is a huge presence descends to fill you,

3209
03:25:08,600 --> 03:25:12,120
like air filling a pig's bladder for a game.

3210
03:25:12,120 --> 03:25:13,799
A voice more ancient and powerful

3211
03:25:13,799 --> 03:25:15,680
than you have ever encountered,

3212
03:25:15,680 --> 03:25:19,659
before introduces itself in grave tones.

3213
03:25:19,659 --> 03:25:22,870
Oh.

3214
03:25:22,870 --> 03:25:24,149
Do you accept this guy?

3215
03:25:24,149 --> 03:25:25,809
Accept.

3216
03:25:25,809 --> 03:25:27,729
You open your heart to worshiping this new god,

3217
03:25:27,729 --> 03:25:30,930
but it does not seem to notice your attention.

3218
03:25:30,930 --> 03:25:33,090
The promise broken.

3219
03:25:33,090 --> 03:25:35,930
Fus spake your brand.

3220
03:25:35,930 --> 03:25:39,129
High of highs, lord of lords.

3221
03:25:39,129 --> 03:25:42,219
God of gods.

3222
03:25:42,219 --> 03:25:45,739
At your feet, the tiny idol explodes to nothing,

3223
03:25:45,739 --> 03:25:48,700
as though it had never been more than a worthless dream.

3224
03:25:48,700 --> 03:25:51,700
Still reeling, you return to the shore.

3225
03:25:51,700 --> 03:25:54,379
Ugh.

3226
03:25:54,379 --> 03:25:58,829
Your brand, the life changer of is god of the gods,

3227
03:25:58,829 --> 03:26:01,149
a truly supreme being.

3228
03:26:01,149 --> 03:26:06,579
Supremely powerful and supremely distant.

3229
03:26:06,579 --> 03:26:08,420
You may pray to your brand,

3230
03:26:08,420 --> 03:26:12,239
though as god of gods, he can offer little aid.

3231
03:26:12,280 --> 03:26:19,700
He can do little good for mere mortals.

3232
03:26:19,700 --> 03:26:21,659
What's, what does he do though?

3233
03:26:21,659 --> 03:26:22,860
Can he do something eventual?

3234
03:26:22,860 --> 03:26:28,889
I wonder if he's powerful.

3235
03:26:28,889 --> 03:26:35,500
You just, god complex?

3236
03:26:35,500 --> 03:26:37,420
Thanks chat, thanks chat, thanks chat.

3237
03:26:37,420 --> 03:26:41,659
He sucks.

3238
03:26:41,659 --> 03:26:44,219
The life change, this is gonna be an opportunity

3239
03:26:44,219 --> 03:26:46,520
where I'm gonna pray and he's gonna be like,

3240
03:26:46,520 --> 03:26:49,760
you know, it amuses me.

3241
03:26:49,760 --> 03:26:51,600
I will give you 10 gold for fun.

3242
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:58,159
Like we, this is, we're amusement to your brand.

3243
03:26:58,159 --> 03:27:02,899
You're getting ghosted by the god of gods.

3244
03:27:02,940 --> 03:27:04,500
We're keeping, yeah, I'm keeping your brand.

3245
03:27:04,500 --> 03:27:12,850
There's gotta be something going on with your brand.

3246
03:27:12,850 --> 03:27:15,319
He's genuinely useless.

3247
03:27:15,319 --> 03:27:16,159
No way.

3248
03:27:16,159 --> 03:27:17,559
No, he's the god of all gods.

3249
03:27:17,559 --> 03:27:18,399
This is Odin.

3250
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:27,639
We have, Odin is in our fucking backpack.

3251
03:27:27,639 --> 03:27:28,760
There's gonna be an opportunity

3252
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:30,559
for something to happen there.

3253
03:27:30,559 --> 03:27:35,350
He's supremely distant.

3254
03:27:35,350 --> 03:27:39,340
I mean, being supremely distant is,

3255
03:27:39,340 --> 03:27:41,510
that's, that's something.

3256
03:27:41,510 --> 03:27:43,290
That's something else.

3257
03:27:43,290 --> 03:27:44,690
I'm very distant.

3258
03:27:44,690 --> 03:27:45,649
I'm kind of distant.

3259
03:27:45,649 --> 03:27:46,729
I'm incredibly distant.

3260
03:27:46,729 --> 03:27:53,020
Supremely distant is like trying to call me,

3261
03:27:53,020 --> 03:27:55,819
like kind of opening up my window and being like,

3262
03:27:55,819 --> 03:28:00,500
hey, person in China, can you hear me?

3263
03:28:00,500 --> 03:28:03,360
No, no, that's supremely distant.

3264
03:28:03,360 --> 03:28:08,430
That's not happening.

3265
03:28:08,430 --> 03:28:14,430
That is the definition of supremely distant.

3266
03:28:14,430 --> 03:28:19,219
Let's continue.

3267
03:28:19,219 --> 03:28:24,889
Please rewind to save ape.

3268
03:28:24,889 --> 03:28:27,930
He's just gonna complain occasionally.

3269
03:28:27,930 --> 03:28:33,049
That's kind of funny though.

3270
03:28:33,049 --> 03:28:34,860
I think that's funny.

3271
03:28:34,860 --> 03:28:38,420
No, we have to keep some things.

3272
03:28:38,420 --> 03:28:39,639
The ape is dead.

3273
03:28:39,639 --> 03:28:43,250
The ape is not dead.

3274
03:28:43,250 --> 03:28:46,159
The ape left my playthrough

3275
03:28:46,159 --> 03:28:50,579
and possibly found you in your playthrough.

3276
03:28:50,579 --> 03:28:52,180
The ape left me,

3277
03:28:52,180 --> 03:28:59,950
but he possibly found another soul like you.

3278
03:28:59,950 --> 03:29:14,600
All right, let's go.

3279
03:29:14,600 --> 03:29:21,239
All right, we're gonna go down here.

3280
03:29:21,239 --> 03:29:23,670
You row the boat across the water.

3281
03:29:23,670 --> 03:29:26,229
The moaning winds pull at your pack and sword.

3282
03:29:26,229 --> 03:29:28,350
Every pole on the oars is tiring.

3283
03:29:28,350 --> 03:29:32,579
The sunlight on the water is all but blinding.

3284
03:29:32,579 --> 03:29:37,309
Middle of the lake.

3285
03:29:37,309 --> 03:29:41,879
You're talking about ape like he's Woody.

3286
03:29:41,879 --> 03:29:45,040
Yeah, it's all right.

3287
03:29:45,159 --> 03:29:46,520
You row the boat onwards across the water.

3288
03:29:46,520 --> 03:29:47,709
It is hot now.

3289
03:29:47,709 --> 03:29:50,159
You are starting to sweat under your cloak.

3290
03:29:50,159 --> 03:29:53,739
You sing a song from your boyhood as you draw on the oars.

3291
03:29:53,739 --> 03:29:59,600
A song of fruit trees and warm milk and soft bedding.

3292
03:29:59,600 --> 03:30:01,079
I'm not going over here yet.

3293
03:30:01,079 --> 03:30:02,219
I don't know what happened.

3294
03:30:02,219 --> 03:30:05,760
Well, actually, no, I do remember this.

3295
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:09,819
I do remember, I think, what to do,

3296
03:30:09,819 --> 03:30:12,540
but I don't wanna spoil it because it's pretty cool.

3297
03:30:12,540 --> 03:30:14,319
I think I remember what to do.

3298
03:30:14,319 --> 03:30:20,719
We're gonna go over here.

3299
03:30:20,719 --> 03:30:22,520
You row the boat onwards across the water.

3300
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:24,870
The mid-afternoon heat fills the region.

3301
03:30:24,870 --> 03:30:27,010
You lean on the oars, moving slowly.

3302
03:30:27,010 --> 03:30:28,760
Ahead forwards across the lake.

3303
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:31,200
The water falls strangely calm.

3304
03:30:31,200 --> 03:30:32,799
Rowing becomes easier.

3305
03:30:32,799 --> 03:30:35,049
And you cut quickly through the water.

3306
03:30:35,049 --> 03:30:37,600
You'll be across the lake in no time.

3307
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:39,959
You notice a thin stream of bubbles

3308
03:30:39,959 --> 03:30:43,329
off to the port side.

3309
03:30:43,329 --> 03:30:46,629
Investigate.

3310
03:30:46,629 --> 03:30:48,639
You row closer to the bubbles.

3311
03:30:48,639 --> 03:30:50,639
They break around you and underneath you.

3312
03:30:50,639 --> 03:30:54,760
And looking down, you see something is rising.

3313
03:30:54,760 --> 03:30:57,520
Row away, lean over the boat to look.

3314
03:30:57,520 --> 03:31:02,079
Something's gonna jump out.

3315
03:31:02,079 --> 03:31:05,399
You lean out over the side of the boat to look down.

3316
03:31:05,399 --> 03:31:08,479
Narrow, dark shadow is hurtling up towards

3317
03:31:08,479 --> 03:31:10,600
as though a spike of rock was being thrust up

3318
03:31:10,600 --> 03:31:11,440
from underwater.

3319
03:31:11,440 --> 03:31:15,079
It will break the surface at any moment.

3320
03:31:15,079 --> 03:31:18,659
Okay, lean back into the boat.

3321
03:31:18,659 --> 03:31:20,120
Sharply, you pull your head back,

3322
03:31:20,120 --> 03:31:22,520
not wanting to be skewered by whatever is rising.

3323
03:31:22,520 --> 03:31:24,200
The sudden movement jerks the boat

3324
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:25,239
and you lose your balance

3325
03:31:25,239 --> 03:31:27,549
and struggle to catch your balance.

3326
03:31:27,549 --> 03:31:29,829
Steady myself.

3327
03:31:29,829 --> 03:31:31,690
You steady yourself, trying to catch your balance,

3328
03:31:31,690 --> 03:31:34,889
only to stamp too heavily in the bottom of the boat.

3329
03:31:34,889 --> 03:31:37,959
It seems your foot has gone through the rotten wood.

3330
03:31:37,959 --> 03:31:39,399
For the moment, the boat does not sink

3331
03:31:39,399 --> 03:31:41,760
because your foot is blocking the hole.

3332
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:48,670
Pray, hey, your bran, your bran, I need you, your bran.

3333
03:31:48,709 --> 03:31:51,430
You close your eyes and raise a prayer to your bran.

3334
03:31:51,430 --> 03:31:53,389
You feel a great calm come over you

3335
03:31:53,389 --> 03:31:55,190
and a moment later, your foot is free

3336
03:31:55,190 --> 03:31:58,229
of the hole in the boat.

3337
03:31:58,229 --> 03:32:00,010
Water bubbles in through the broken wood

3338
03:32:00,010 --> 03:32:05,450
and the boat sinks from underneath you.

3339
03:32:05,450 --> 03:32:07,049
Well, okay.

3340
03:32:07,049 --> 03:32:09,729
Once again, your fragile possessions are ruined,

3341
03:32:09,729 --> 03:32:12,489
including the goblin's precious parchment.

3342
03:32:12,489 --> 03:32:14,889
Your spell book is soggy but remains otherwise intact,

3343
03:32:14,889 --> 03:32:17,110
but all of your soft food has been ruined,

3344
03:32:17,149 --> 03:32:18,629
breaking through the surface of the water

3345
03:32:18,629 --> 03:32:22,850
is a long thin shape that rises in a coil and then,

3346
03:32:22,850 --> 03:32:25,920
can I rewind?

3347
03:32:25,920 --> 03:32:30,040
You half smile with pleasure at the encounter

3348
03:32:30,040 --> 03:32:32,440
because the water is serpent.

3349
03:32:32,440 --> 03:32:33,659
Can I rewind?

3350
03:32:33,659 --> 03:32:35,139
I need to rewind, I have to rewind.

3351
03:32:35,139 --> 03:32:38,000
I need to throw this fucking orb, I'm reminding.

3352
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:39,340
I have to throw the orb at him.

3353
03:32:39,340 --> 03:32:43,600
I can't just break the, hold on, investigate.

3354
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:46,239
Okay, row away.

3355
03:32:46,239 --> 03:32:47,520
Yes, we're fine, we're fine.

3356
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:49,639
I'm a cheater, that's fine.

3357
03:32:49,639 --> 03:32:51,760
You turn the boat and row away from the rising bubbles

3358
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:53,079
but you are not fast enough.

3359
03:32:53,079 --> 03:32:56,180
What?

3360
03:32:56,180 --> 03:32:57,659
Breaking through the surface of the water

3361
03:32:57,659 --> 03:32:59,620
is a long thin shape.

3362
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:03,239
It rises to one side of the boat in a coil.

3363
03:33:03,239 --> 03:33:05,870
Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

3364
03:33:05,870 --> 03:33:15,979
Draw my sword, cast a spell.

3365
03:33:15,979 --> 03:33:30,270
Okay, I throw a grenade at him.

3366
03:33:30,270 --> 03:33:39,889
Sap, cause depression.

3367
03:33:39,889 --> 03:33:47,170
Wrap, talk all languages.

3368
03:33:47,170 --> 03:33:48,010
Pulling out the green wig,

3369
03:33:48,010 --> 03:33:49,530
you pull it onto your head and cast a spell

3370
03:33:49,530 --> 03:33:52,149
but the serpent only laughs at you.

3371
03:33:52,149 --> 03:33:57,149
Hahahaha, you cannot compel me to speak

3372
03:33:57,149 --> 03:33:59,389
like some creature.

3373
03:33:59,389 --> 03:34:04,270
I only say this, I am a spirit of water itself

3374
03:34:04,270 --> 03:34:08,670
and I will drain my essence from your carcass.

3375
03:34:08,670 --> 03:34:11,069
The water serpent is now free of the water

3376
03:34:11,069 --> 03:34:15,090
and hovers a massive shape against the dark sky.

3377
03:34:15,090 --> 03:34:18,010
It stretches open its wide jaws.

3378
03:34:18,010 --> 03:34:20,440
Grow the sun serpent.

3379
03:34:20,440 --> 03:34:26,540
Grow something into the creature's mouth.

3380
03:34:26,540 --> 03:34:29,620
Hahahaha, I'm gonna throw an apple.

3381
03:34:29,620 --> 03:34:31,420
Take this, bastard.

3382
03:34:31,420 --> 03:34:32,500
Throw an apple.

3383
03:34:33,059 --> 03:34:40,049
Mm, crunchy, sweet, overly ripe.

3384
03:34:40,049 --> 03:34:44,440
It's the sun serpent orb.

3385
03:34:44,440 --> 03:34:48,860
Throw my sword, why would you ever do that?

3386
03:34:48,860 --> 03:34:53,520
Throw the goblet of lynch bug oil?

3387
03:34:53,520 --> 03:34:57,389
It's definitely the sun serpent.

3388
03:34:57,389 --> 03:35:01,170
Please do it, I'll, okay, I'm allowed to rewind, right?

3389
03:35:01,170 --> 03:35:03,620
Throw an apple.

3390
03:35:03,620 --> 03:35:06,260
You toss an apple into the back of the serpent's mouth

3391
03:35:06,260 --> 03:35:07,100
and nothing happens.

3392
03:35:07,100 --> 03:35:08,020
Imagine if it was like,

3393
03:35:08,020 --> 03:35:16,489
ah, and you choke the water serpent to death.

3394
03:35:16,489 --> 03:35:18,760
Imagine throwing an apple.

3395
03:35:18,799 --> 03:35:20,809
I don't, okay, throw an apple.

3396
03:35:20,809 --> 03:35:22,770
You throw an apple into the back of the serpent's mouth

3397
03:35:22,770 --> 03:35:23,610
and nothing happens.

3398
03:35:23,610 --> 03:35:24,690
Throw your sword.

3399
03:35:24,690 --> 03:35:26,770
You swallow hard and then toss the long sword

3400
03:35:26,770 --> 03:35:29,090
into the soft flesh of the back of the serpent's mouth.

3401
03:35:29,090 --> 03:35:31,809
It gags and throw another apple in.

3402
03:35:31,809 --> 03:35:34,370
You throw another apple into the serpent's mouth.

3403
03:35:34,370 --> 03:35:37,209
You throw sand, throw a handful of sand.

3404
03:35:37,209 --> 03:35:39,850
You toss a handful of sand into the serpent's mouth.

3405
03:35:39,850 --> 03:35:41,770
Clearly sand is not this serpent's weakness.

3406
03:35:41,770 --> 03:35:43,569
Throw the goblet of oil.

3407
03:35:43,569 --> 03:35:45,520
You, wait, what?

3408
03:35:45,520 --> 03:35:47,440
You toss the glob of lynch bug oil

3409
03:35:47,440 --> 03:35:49,479
deep into the mouth of the creature

3410
03:35:49,479 --> 03:35:52,520
and then watch in amazement as it takes effect.

3411
03:35:52,520 --> 03:35:55,319
In mere moments, the serpent breaks into splashes of water

3412
03:35:55,319 --> 03:35:57,840
which rain down across the surface of the lake.

3413
03:35:57,840 --> 03:36:05,450
The water falls quiet once more.

3414
03:36:05,450 --> 03:36:14,680
Oil and water, it worked.

3415
03:36:14,680 --> 03:36:16,479
Was that the grimace shake?

3416
03:36:20,420 --> 03:36:22,739
That's a good one.

3417
03:36:22,739 --> 03:36:24,100
That's a good one.

3418
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:27,440
That's all right.

3419
03:36:27,440 --> 03:36:29,520
All right, let me rewind and do it the right way.

3420
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:31,120
Imagine throwing everything in your backpack

3421
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:31,959
and something works.

3422
03:36:31,959 --> 03:36:33,430
All right, let's do it.

3423
03:36:33,430 --> 03:36:35,440
Let's do it the right way.

3424
03:36:35,440 --> 03:36:37,360
Investigate.

3425
03:36:37,360 --> 03:36:39,399
Okay, roll away.

3426
03:36:39,399 --> 03:36:42,379
Here's the water serpent.

3427
03:36:42,379 --> 03:36:45,090
Cast a spell.

3428
03:36:45,090 --> 03:36:48,090
That spell was, what was it again?

3429
03:36:48,090 --> 03:36:52,559
Oh, right, it was wrap.

3430
03:36:52,559 --> 03:36:57,530
I did that incredible voice work.

3431
03:36:57,530 --> 03:36:58,850
All right, here we go.

3432
03:36:58,850 --> 03:37:04,659
Throw the sun serpent orb.

3433
03:37:04,659 --> 03:37:07,459
You pull back your arm and lob the sun serpent orb

3434
03:37:07,459 --> 03:37:10,129
into the open jaws of the water serpent.

3435
03:37:10,129 --> 03:37:12,090
The serpent does not know what it is.

3436
03:37:12,090 --> 03:37:15,409
It catches the orb, its eyes bright with cruel delight

3437
03:37:15,409 --> 03:37:18,680
and then it crunches down on the crystal glass.

3438
03:37:18,680 --> 03:37:21,879
For a moment, you see the flicker of the sun serpents fire

3439
03:37:21,879 --> 03:37:25,750
before the racked teeth close.

3440
03:37:25,750 --> 03:37:28,659
That was the sun serpent you ate.

3441
03:37:28,659 --> 03:37:31,940
You shout manically remembering that Finestra told you

3442
03:37:31,940 --> 03:37:34,229
the two serpents were mates.

3443
03:37:34,229 --> 03:37:36,950
The serpent's eyes grow wide at your words.

3444
03:37:36,950 --> 03:37:38,829
It opens its mouth to reply.

3445
03:37:38,829 --> 03:37:39,670
Huh.

3446
03:37:39,670 --> 03:37:42,030
And a jet of flame erupts from its mouth.

3447
03:37:42,030 --> 03:37:47,719
Its belly is beginning to pulse visibly with violent heat.

3448
03:37:47,719 --> 03:37:49,379
Move away.

3449
03:37:55,059 --> 03:37:58,819
You shift back expecting an explosion.

3450
03:37:58,819 --> 03:38:01,540
And when it comes, it is violent and bright.

3451
03:38:01,540 --> 03:38:03,340
A ball of flame that makes the water below

3452
03:38:03,340 --> 03:38:05,819
steam up in a great cloud.

3453
03:38:05,819 --> 03:38:11,770
You have now defeated five of the seven serpents.

3454
03:38:11,770 --> 03:38:13,469
Only five.

3455
03:38:13,469 --> 03:38:15,819
Keep watching.

3456
03:38:15,819 --> 03:38:19,229
You keep watching convinced it's quite all over

3457
03:38:19,229 --> 03:38:21,250
and your instincts are correct.

3458
03:38:21,250 --> 03:38:23,850
There's a flicker of movement in the steam.

3459
03:38:23,850 --> 03:38:25,530
Blight begins to shimmer through the clouds,

3460
03:38:25,530 --> 03:38:27,969
then it breaks and the sun emerges.

3461
03:38:27,969 --> 03:38:30,969
Weakened but angrier than ever.

3462
03:38:30,969 --> 03:38:32,969
I will kill you for this.

3463
03:38:32,969 --> 03:38:36,370
I will grill every piece of you.

3464
03:38:36,370 --> 03:38:39,819
Wait, what?

3465
03:38:46,649 --> 03:38:47,879
Uh-oh.

3466
03:38:47,879 --> 03:38:51,729
Look at it, it's almost dead.

3467
03:38:51,729 --> 03:38:53,049
You spread your arms to cast a spell

3468
03:38:53,049 --> 03:38:54,090
but you are not fast enough.

3469
03:38:54,090 --> 03:38:55,409
The serpent swoops.

3470
03:38:55,409 --> 03:38:57,170
You will have to defend yourself.

3471
03:38:57,170 --> 03:38:59,569
It screams in rage.

3472
03:38:59,569 --> 03:39:01,129
Despite losing its fire,

3473
03:39:01,129 --> 03:39:03,170
it will still be a powerful opponent.

3474
03:39:03,170 --> 03:39:04,010
Oh, fuck you.

3475
03:39:04,010 --> 03:39:07,090
Seven stamina, fucking eight attack power.

3476
03:39:07,090 --> 03:39:09,010
Ah, full blast.

3477
03:39:09,010 --> 03:39:13,110
Uh-oh.

3478
03:39:13,110 --> 03:39:15,790
Water streams from the sun, serpents hide.

3479
03:39:15,790 --> 03:39:18,030
And as they run, they claw deep scratches

3480
03:39:18,950 --> 03:39:19,790
through the creature's hide.

3481
03:39:19,790 --> 03:39:21,430
You twist your blade and strike,

3482
03:39:21,430 --> 03:39:23,319
hoping to skewer into its heart.

3483
03:39:23,319 --> 03:39:24,360
But the serpent rears back

3484
03:39:24,360 --> 03:39:26,860
and you cannot land more than a passing blow.

3485
03:39:26,860 --> 03:39:32,159
The sun serpents long body stretches in arcs.

3486
03:39:32,159 --> 03:39:35,280
We're good.

3487
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:37,000
You drop back just as the serpent rises

3488
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:40,440
into a rage of talons and sharpened wings.

3489
03:39:40,440 --> 03:39:42,520
You push away its force.

3490
03:39:42,520 --> 03:39:46,000
The yellow scales on the serpent fade to gray.

3491
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:50,420
All right, I'm saying like 3.0.

3492
03:39:50,420 --> 03:39:54,579
God damn it.

3493
03:39:54,579 --> 03:39:55,420
0.1.

3494
03:39:55,420 --> 03:39:56,620
I'm always so afraid to do this

3495
03:39:56,620 --> 03:40:01,309
because if they do like 1.0, it's awful.

3496
03:40:01,309 --> 03:40:05,530
Sun serpent leans back, escaping the worst of the blow.

3497
03:40:05,530 --> 03:40:07,090
4.4.

3498
03:40:07,090 --> 03:40:08,430
Yep.

3499
03:40:08,430 --> 03:40:11,360
Good swordplay.

3500
03:40:11,360 --> 03:40:12,920
Okay, the light in the creature's eyes flickers

3501
03:40:12,920 --> 03:40:14,079
for a moment.

3502
03:40:14,079 --> 03:40:15,159
The serpent coils up,

3503
03:40:15,159 --> 03:40:16,840
gathering itself into a shimmering pile

3504
03:40:16,840 --> 03:40:19,069
of scales and teeth.

3505
03:40:19,069 --> 03:40:21,149
Now we go all in

3506
03:40:21,149 --> 03:40:24,370
because I think they're gonna attack.

3507
03:40:24,370 --> 03:40:25,799
It's okay.

3508
03:40:25,799 --> 03:40:29,760
Bend.

3509
03:40:29,760 --> 03:40:31,360
Clouds are gathering deep in the serpent's eyes.

3510
03:40:31,360 --> 03:40:33,639
The serpent stretches its talons to the sky.

3511
03:40:33,639 --> 03:40:35,579
Yeah, defend.

3512
03:40:35,579 --> 03:40:39,020
All right, game over, Gigi.

3513
03:40:39,020 --> 03:40:40,420
You take a step away as once again

3514
03:40:40,420 --> 03:40:42,260
the sun serpent lashes out.

3515
03:40:42,260 --> 03:40:43,959
You hold it back.

3516
03:40:43,959 --> 03:40:45,440
You have not destroyed me

3517
03:40:45,440 --> 03:40:46,840
and you shall not.

3518
03:40:56,709 --> 03:40:59,319
A rapid slash bites into the serpent's hide.

3519
03:40:59,319 --> 03:41:01,950
The sun serpent seems to turn black for a moment.

3520
03:41:01,950 --> 03:41:14,159
Then its skin turns a heavy gray and it falls.

3521
03:41:14,159 --> 03:41:17,239
You stagger backwards, sweating but unbowed.

3522
03:41:17,239 --> 03:41:19,290
The serpent is dead.

3523
03:41:19,290 --> 03:41:21,250
You have now defeated six.

3524
03:41:21,250 --> 03:41:24,209
Of the seven serpents.

3525
03:41:24,209 --> 03:41:26,879
But you feel a flush of satisfaction.

3526
03:41:26,879 --> 03:41:29,799
Only one serpent remains.

3527
03:41:29,799 --> 03:41:31,840
None of the others will be reporting your mission

3528
03:41:31,840 --> 03:41:34,200
to their master.

3529
03:41:34,200 --> 03:41:36,620
The water falls still.

3530
03:41:36,620 --> 03:41:39,110
Looking up, you sense a suitable formation

3531
03:41:39,110 --> 03:41:44,270
of stars above you.

3532
03:41:44,270 --> 03:41:51,559
Why would it give me an opportunity to do this?

3533
03:41:51,559 --> 03:41:54,709
I thought it was gonna be Zed.

3534
03:41:54,709 --> 03:41:57,239
Uh, big?

3535
03:41:57,239 --> 03:42:00,239
No.

3536
03:42:00,239 --> 03:42:05,659
This might be to quickly get out of here.

3537
03:42:05,659 --> 03:42:07,940
I don't think we need to do anything.

3538
03:42:07,940 --> 03:42:11,270
We just row on.

3539
03:42:11,270 --> 03:42:13,969
But no amount of magic will shrink the size of the lake.

3540
03:42:13,969 --> 03:42:15,170
You row onwards.

3541
03:42:16,319 --> 03:42:19,409
You've come within reach of a rocky island.

3542
03:42:19,409 --> 03:42:31,069
Not going over there yet.

3543
03:42:31,069 --> 03:42:34,520
We're, oh, this is it.

3544
03:42:34,520 --> 03:42:42,479
I'm about to beat the third game.

3545
03:42:42,479 --> 03:42:44,360
I know how to win, by the way.

3546
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:51,760
All right, those of you that don't want to know,

3547
03:42:51,760 --> 03:42:54,700
if you do not want to know how to do this,

3548
03:42:54,700 --> 03:42:58,659
I would, like, I don't know, come back and like,

3549
03:42:58,659 --> 03:43:04,670
I would just leave.

3550
03:43:04,670 --> 03:43:07,989
What about the new spell?

3551
03:43:07,989 --> 03:43:09,510
All right, those of you that don't care,

3552
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:11,559
we can talk about it.

3553
03:43:11,559 --> 03:43:14,520
Here's how you do it.

3554
03:43:14,520 --> 03:43:18,049
The time serpent is unkillable.

3555
03:43:18,049 --> 03:43:19,530
It's impossible.

3556
03:43:20,090 --> 03:43:26,750
But if you point this over here, this over here,

3557
03:43:26,750 --> 03:43:29,350
if you point, I believe it's at least three

3558
03:43:29,350 --> 03:43:33,610
of these time travel beams at the serpent,

3559
03:43:33,610 --> 03:43:36,229
you can kill it.

3560
03:43:36,229 --> 03:43:38,069
So no, no spoilers.

3561
03:43:38,069 --> 03:43:39,469
I just said, I just told you that.

3562
03:43:39,469 --> 03:43:40,469
I just told you we were doing spoilers.

3563
03:43:40,469 --> 03:43:44,319
I just told you.

3564
03:43:44,319 --> 03:43:48,809
That's clever.

3565
03:43:48,809 --> 03:43:49,649
You ruined the game.

3566
03:43:49,649 --> 03:43:51,649
I just, well, I do, yeah, he's unkillable

3567
03:43:51,649 --> 03:43:53,610
unless you do the specific thing.

3568
03:43:53,610 --> 03:43:59,909
So let's go over here, turn it on.

3569
03:43:59,909 --> 03:44:03,729
I guessed that instantly and I never played the game.

3570
03:44:03,729 --> 03:44:07,989
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3571
03:44:08,030 --> 03:44:08,870
Okay.

3572
03:44:08,870 --> 03:44:10,790
The island is covered in dense tree cover.

3573
03:44:10,790 --> 03:44:13,760
The top of a stone tower is just visible above the canopy.

3574
03:44:13,760 --> 03:44:15,840
In the shallow water stands a bell.

3575
03:44:15,840 --> 03:44:18,809
Your small boat bobs in the shallows.

3576
03:44:18,809 --> 03:44:22,940
I despise the empty dreary mortal coil.

3577
03:44:22,940 --> 03:44:27,479
In tones, you're God, you ran.

3578
03:44:27,479 --> 03:44:36,540
Okay, dude, that it?

3579
03:44:36,540 --> 03:44:38,420
You don't have nothing else to say?

3580
03:44:38,420 --> 03:44:39,260
That's it?

3581
03:44:39,260 --> 03:44:44,819
You just gonna insult me?

3582
03:44:44,819 --> 03:44:46,340
The path winds along the shoreline

3583
03:44:46,340 --> 03:44:48,959
skirting an area of dense trees.

3584
03:44:48,959 --> 03:44:51,350
Then it ducks below the canopy

3585
03:44:51,350 --> 03:44:54,559
and you are surrounded by the calling of strange creatures.

3586
03:44:54,600 --> 03:44:57,600
Insects and birds buzz past your face.

3587
03:44:57,600 --> 03:45:00,120
From the shore, you saw a stone tower

3588
03:45:00,120 --> 03:45:03,149
sticking up between the trees that fill the island's heart.

3589
03:45:03,149 --> 03:45:04,950
But now you cannot see the way forward

3590
03:45:04,950 --> 03:45:09,229
and the path seems to twist and turn about.

3591
03:45:09,229 --> 03:45:15,170
Probably go big.

3592
03:45:15,170 --> 03:45:20,760
Your brand is just like us for real.

3593
03:45:20,760 --> 03:45:24,860
Ah, tell, why would I use tell?

3594
03:45:24,860 --> 03:45:27,920
Zen, I could float above the trees.

3595
03:45:27,920 --> 03:45:29,600
Hot is no how is safe.

3596
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:35,129
Let's do how, safe passage.

3597
03:45:35,129 --> 03:45:35,969
You weave the enchantment

3598
03:45:35,969 --> 03:45:38,010
and a quiet voice begins to speak to you.

3599
03:45:38,010 --> 03:45:39,569
The voice indicates a thin path

3600
03:45:39,569 --> 03:45:42,010
that will lead to this island's tower.

3601
03:45:43,819 --> 03:45:45,530
With that, the spell fades.

3602
03:45:45,530 --> 03:45:47,690
A flock of nearby birds startle at something,

3603
03:45:47,690 --> 03:45:51,120
lifting suddenly into the trees.

3604
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:54,149
We're gonna follow the how.

3605
03:45:54,149 --> 03:45:55,469
Trusting to your spell,

3606
03:45:55,469 --> 03:45:57,909
you follow the narrow track between the trees.

3607
03:45:57,909 --> 03:45:59,629
After a few minutes of walking,

3608
03:45:59,629 --> 03:46:03,000
you come with sight of the base of a stone tower.

3609
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:10,379
It is heavily overgrown.

3610
03:46:10,379 --> 03:46:12,100
The door to the tower stands open.

3611
03:46:12,100 --> 03:46:13,979
Gnarled roots and vines have forced it open

3612
03:46:13,979 --> 03:46:17,600
and are now holding it ajar.

3613
03:46:17,600 --> 03:46:22,459
Ahem.

3614
03:46:22,459 --> 03:46:25,899
The inside of the tower is dank and filled with mud

3615
03:46:25,899 --> 03:46:29,239
as though it has been flooded and emptied several times.

3616
03:46:29,239 --> 03:46:32,079
Stone stairs curve up to a hatch in the roof.

3617
03:46:32,079 --> 03:46:34,200
You gasp as you notice the walls,

3618
03:46:34,200 --> 03:46:37,489
which are covered floor to ceiling with intricate carvings.

3619
03:46:37,489 --> 03:46:41,250
Suddenly something lights up in a dark corner, a flame.

3620
03:46:41,250 --> 03:46:43,180
Look at the flame.

3621
03:46:43,180 --> 03:46:45,899
The flame seems to hover a short way off the ground.

3622
03:46:45,899 --> 03:46:47,780
As you watch, it swells in size

3623
03:46:47,780 --> 03:46:52,340
from a single thumb to a fireball size of a small dish.

3624
03:46:52,340 --> 03:46:54,870
Call out, who's there?

3625
03:46:54,870 --> 03:46:58,120
You demand into the pooled darkness behind the flame.

3626
03:46:58,120 --> 03:47:00,079
The fire has grown now to a full fireball

3627
03:47:00,079 --> 03:47:01,719
of clearly magical nature.

3628
03:47:01,719 --> 03:47:04,360
And in its light, you can see what is holding it.

3629
03:47:04,360 --> 03:47:06,600
It is a rough wooden frame of sticks

3630
03:47:06,600 --> 03:47:11,520
shaped into the form of a woman with arms spread wide.

3631
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:13,959
It's a Grimelkin.

3632
03:47:13,959 --> 03:47:15,299
It's a Grimelkin!

3633
03:47:15,299 --> 03:47:16,620
Like those you saw as an apprentice,

3634
03:47:16,620 --> 03:47:18,420
magical constructions which gather magic

3635
03:47:18,420 --> 03:47:21,530
the way a funnel gathers rainwater.

3636
03:47:21,530 --> 03:47:23,879
Right, let's watch.

3637
03:47:23,879 --> 03:47:25,209
You wait and watch.

3638
03:47:25,209 --> 03:47:26,610
A fireball, hot and fierce,

3639
03:47:26,610 --> 03:47:30,799
shoots forward from the wooden frame onwards towards you.

3640
03:47:30,799 --> 03:47:32,399
Duck.

3641
03:47:32,399 --> 03:47:34,479
You hit the floor and the fireball punches over you,

3642
03:47:34,479 --> 03:47:35,520
not aiming at the door,

3643
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:36,959
but instead splashing up the staircase

3644
03:47:36,959 --> 03:47:38,700
that leads up the tower.

3645
03:47:38,700 --> 03:47:45,389
The room is dark for a moment.

3646
03:47:45,389 --> 03:47:46,389
Always dodge left,

3647
03:47:47,799 --> 03:47:50,760
unless it is a fixed device that's shooting.

3648
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:53,500
Can I talk?

3649
03:47:53,500 --> 03:47:54,340
Oh, hell yeah.

3650
03:47:54,340 --> 03:47:55,579
Wait, talk with animals.

3651
03:47:55,579 --> 03:47:58,569
Is a Grimelkin an animal?

3652
03:47:58,569 --> 03:47:59,989
Let's find out.

3653
03:47:59,989 --> 03:48:06,899
Is it an animal?

3654
03:48:06,899 --> 03:48:08,059
No, it's not.

3655
03:48:10,040 --> 03:48:14,049
Okay.

3656
03:48:14,049 --> 03:48:17,920
Look up the stairs.

3657
03:48:17,920 --> 03:48:19,040
In the light from the Grimelkin,

3658
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:21,799
you follow the line of the staircase with your eyes.

3659
03:48:21,799 --> 03:48:23,559
At the top is a trap door,

3660
03:48:23,559 --> 03:48:25,690
sealed with a rusty old bolt.

3661
03:48:25,690 --> 03:48:26,530
If the bolt is stiff,

3662
03:48:26,530 --> 03:48:29,549
it might take some time to coerce it into opening.

3663
03:48:29,549 --> 03:48:31,149
The fireball spell is completed

3664
03:48:31,149 --> 03:48:35,239
and splashes across the stones of the staircase.

3665
03:48:35,239 --> 03:48:38,239
Look at the Grimelkin.

3666
03:48:38,239 --> 03:48:39,200
All right, we gotta make a move.

3667
03:48:39,200 --> 03:48:41,120
In the pause between fireballs and darkness,

3668
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:43,360
you can see a little of the Grimelkin.

3669
03:48:43,360 --> 03:48:46,120
The frame is built from old half-rotten wood,

3670
03:48:46,120 --> 03:48:48,639
beams that were once perhaps part of a roof.

3671
03:48:48,639 --> 03:48:51,200
A single upright forms the body and head.

3672
03:48:51,200 --> 03:48:54,600
Its two arms are angled outwards to collect starlight.

3673
03:48:54,600 --> 03:48:57,200
It has clearly been positioned beneath the stars

3674
03:48:57,200 --> 03:49:01,149
of Hyat, Osrys, and Thara,

3675
03:49:01,149 --> 03:49:02,870
an angle so the resulting fireball

3676
03:49:02,870 --> 03:49:04,899
is directed at the staircase.

3677
03:49:04,899 --> 03:49:07,979
For a moment, the tower is dark.

3678
03:49:07,979 --> 03:49:14,260
Let's destroy this thing.

3679
03:49:14,260 --> 03:49:23,200
I'm gonna zap it.

3680
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:26,760
Great lightning zap.

3681
03:49:26,760 --> 03:49:28,280
Consulting the constellations overhead,

3682
03:49:28,280 --> 03:49:29,239
you bind the spell,

3683
03:49:29,239 --> 03:49:33,270
winding a powerful electric force in your hand, fire it.

3684
03:49:33,270 --> 03:49:35,719
Then you fire it at the Grimelkin.

3685
03:49:35,719 --> 03:49:39,629
It explodes in a fantastic display of power and fire.

3686
03:49:39,629 --> 03:49:41,069
All the magical energy within,

3687
03:49:41,069 --> 03:49:43,469
burning blue, green, and purple.

3688
03:49:43,469 --> 03:49:48,440
You're left gasping, half-cooked from...

3689
03:49:48,440 --> 03:49:51,129
Oh shit, I lost a lot of health.

3690
03:49:51,129 --> 03:49:53,829
From the heat but alive.

3691
03:49:53,829 --> 03:49:57,000
With the Grimelkin destroyed, the tower falls quiet.

3692
03:49:57,000 --> 03:49:58,799
Once more, you notice the carvings on the wall,

3693
03:49:58,799 --> 03:50:02,670
forgotten in your battling with the Grimelkin.

3694
03:50:02,670 --> 03:50:05,079
The carvings are beautifully preserved.

3695
03:50:05,079 --> 03:50:07,639
Unlike in all the other towers you've climbed,

3696
03:50:07,639 --> 03:50:09,899
they cover the walls from floor to roof,

3697
03:50:09,899 --> 03:50:11,969
telling a story in sequence.

3698
03:50:11,969 --> 03:50:14,569
The first panel show the construction of a great city

3699
03:50:14,569 --> 03:50:17,760
on the shores of a lake by a powerful and proud people.

3700
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:20,000
Then the city is threatened by a series of avalanches

3701
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:21,239
and other disasters.

3702
03:50:21,239 --> 03:50:23,719
Attributed to an underground demon,

3703
03:50:23,719 --> 03:50:26,459
several buildings are destroyed.

3704
03:50:26,459 --> 03:50:27,659
You climb a little way up the stairs

3705
03:50:27,659 --> 03:50:30,309
to pick up the story of the carvings.

3706
03:50:30,309 --> 03:50:32,110
The destroyed buildings are rebuilt,

3707
03:50:32,110 --> 03:50:33,670
but a council of wise men and women

3708
03:50:33,670 --> 03:50:35,680
are gathered to discuss the problem.

3709
03:50:35,680 --> 03:50:38,000
They scratch their beards and comb their hair

3710
03:50:38,000 --> 03:50:39,680
and rub their eyes in thought,

3711
03:50:39,680 --> 03:50:42,920
and finally they set to building a series of great towers

3712
03:50:42,920 --> 03:50:44,799
scattered around the land.

3713
03:50:44,799 --> 03:50:48,239
The purpose of the towers is not clear, however,

3714
03:50:48,239 --> 03:50:50,840
but all seem convinced they will save the city

3715
03:50:50,840 --> 03:50:52,670
from further disaster.

3716
03:50:52,670 --> 03:50:55,969
They celebrate with raised arms.

3717
03:50:55,969 --> 03:50:57,930
The final panels of the carving show a man

3718
03:50:57,930 --> 03:51:00,530
in a horned helmet delivering some kind of equipment

3719
03:51:00,530 --> 03:51:02,909
to the builders of the stone towers.

3720
03:51:02,909 --> 03:51:04,750
From the symbols on this man's cloak,

3721
03:51:04,750 --> 03:51:07,069
you realize he is supposed to be one of the archmages

3722
03:51:07,069 --> 03:51:09,000
of High Zamen.

3723
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:11,520
Each tower is fitted with a lantern,

3724
03:51:11,520 --> 03:51:13,299
and the lanterns are lit.

3725
03:51:13,299 --> 03:51:16,340
Birds freeze in midair, rivers cease.

3726
03:51:16,340 --> 03:51:17,299
In the light of the lantern,

3727
03:51:17,299 --> 03:51:21,479
clouds stop their scuttling across the sky.

3728
03:51:21,479 --> 03:51:22,879
Below the level of the towers,

3729
03:51:22,879 --> 03:51:25,290
the land is peaceful and the people are happy.

3730
03:51:25,290 --> 03:51:27,700
It seems the light will keep them safe,

3731
03:51:27,700 --> 03:51:29,989
and that is the end of the story.

3732
03:51:29,989 --> 03:51:32,989
From here, you could go up the tower

3733
03:51:32,989 --> 03:51:37,639
or back out into the trees.

3734
03:51:37,639 --> 03:51:40,190
Okay.

3735
03:51:40,190 --> 03:51:41,469
You make your way up the steps of the tower

3736
03:51:41,469 --> 03:51:42,670
and open the hatch in the ceiling.

3737
03:51:42,670 --> 03:51:46,469
Once again, the tower is topped with a movable cylinder

3738
03:51:46,469 --> 03:51:48,440
and blue crystal.

3739
03:51:48,440 --> 03:51:51,280
Activate the, am I gonna, I get health for this, right?

3740
03:51:51,280 --> 03:51:53,770
This tower seems to be broken.

3741
03:51:53,770 --> 03:51:54,690
You're forced to give it a kick

3742
03:51:54,690 --> 03:51:56,209
before the beam begins to shine.

3743
03:51:56,209 --> 03:51:58,760
Okay.

3744
03:51:58,760 --> 03:52:02,100
All right, let's do it.

3745
03:52:02,100 --> 03:52:09,229
Boom, one.

3746
03:52:09,229 --> 03:52:12,559
It seems incredible that anyone should have built

3747
03:52:12,559 --> 03:52:16,159
these towers with their curious lanterns.

3748
03:52:16,159 --> 03:52:17,479
Indeed, you cannot help but wonder

3749
03:52:17,479 --> 03:52:20,049
what these towers did originally.

3750
03:52:20,049 --> 03:52:21,809
What appeared in the land beneath the beam

3751
03:52:21,809 --> 03:52:24,879
when the land was everywhere, lush and green.

3752
03:52:24,879 --> 03:52:25,719
Where the light touches you,

3753
03:52:25,719 --> 03:52:30,850
you feel suddenly much better.

3754
03:52:30,850 --> 03:52:33,120
Look at the view.

3755
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:34,600
From here, you can see across the island

3756
03:52:34,600 --> 03:52:35,920
of the water that surrounds it.

3757
03:52:35,920 --> 03:52:38,540
More interesting is the shoreline further south,

3758
03:52:38,540 --> 03:52:40,340
where the ruins of two statues are just visible

3759
03:52:40,340 --> 03:52:41,459
atop a broken landing.

3760
03:52:41,459 --> 03:52:44,540
Sad age.

3761
03:52:44,540 --> 03:52:48,440
Must have been a Grand Harbor once.

3762
03:52:48,440 --> 03:52:51,149
Touch the crystal.

3763
03:52:51,149 --> 03:52:58,819
We're gonna go here, point it this way.

3764
03:52:58,819 --> 03:53:00,379
He's losing steam.

3765
03:53:00,379 --> 03:53:04,549
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

3766
03:53:04,549 --> 03:53:07,479
All right, adjust the beam.

3767
03:53:07,479 --> 03:53:10,319
Hey, time serpent.

3768
03:53:10,319 --> 03:53:18,250
You're in fucking trouble now.

3769
03:53:18,250 --> 03:53:31,680
He's losing steam.

3770
03:53:31,680 --> 03:53:39,120
That's always so loud.

3771
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:46,399
Aha, that's gonna be tricky now, isn't it?

3772
03:53:46,399 --> 03:53:55,040
Think that's in the right spot.

3773
03:53:55,040 --> 03:54:00,239
Okay, everybody.

3774
03:54:00,239 --> 03:54:13,559
It's time to kill this motherfucker.

3775
03:54:13,559 --> 03:54:17,649
Climb down.

3776
03:54:17,649 --> 03:54:19,010
Bottom left isn't reaching.

3777
03:54:21,969 --> 03:54:25,610
I think it is.

3778
03:54:25,610 --> 03:54:28,319
Is it not concentrated enough?

3779
03:54:28,319 --> 03:54:29,399
We'll find out.

3780
03:54:29,399 --> 03:54:33,600
I can always just rewind.

3781
03:54:33,600 --> 03:54:36,520
Is this the end?

3782
03:54:36,520 --> 03:54:38,629
There is an entire nother game.

3783
03:54:38,629 --> 03:54:42,420
So it's part four.

3784
03:54:42,420 --> 03:54:51,059
It is just as long as this one.

3785
03:54:51,059 --> 03:54:53,350
What the heck are you doing, game?

3786
03:54:53,350 --> 03:54:56,430
What are you doing, game?

3787
03:54:56,430 --> 03:54:59,409
Which you're going to play in 2025.

3788
03:54:59,409 --> 03:55:04,280
No, that's not true.

3789
03:55:04,280 --> 03:55:14,149
2024, that's not true.

3790
03:55:14,149 --> 03:55:22,239
All right, let's go confront the time serpent.

3791
03:55:22,239 --> 03:55:24,239
You row the boat onwards across the water.

3792
03:55:24,239 --> 03:55:25,590
Night falls.

3793
03:55:25,590 --> 03:55:26,969
You need to rest.

3794
03:55:26,969 --> 03:55:30,629
Especially after so much sculling on an empty stomach.

3795
03:55:30,629 --> 03:55:32,340
You row onwards.

3796
03:55:32,340 --> 03:55:33,260
A short distance ahead,

3797
03:55:33,260 --> 03:55:35,760
another commotion in the water appears.

3798
03:55:35,760 --> 03:55:37,979
But this one is unavoidable.

3799
03:55:37,979 --> 03:55:38,860
Leaping up from the water,

3800
03:55:38,860 --> 03:55:41,620
a small school of flying fish are springing into the air

3801
03:55:41,620 --> 03:55:48,120
and flying towards you.

3802
03:55:48,120 --> 03:55:50,180
Ignore them.

3803
03:55:50,180 --> 03:55:51,020
Cast a spell.

3804
03:55:51,020 --> 03:56:01,440
What can I do?

3805
03:56:01,440 --> 03:56:03,239
Can you summon replica creature?

3806
03:56:03,239 --> 03:56:04,200
Can, no.

3807
03:56:07,940 --> 03:56:15,989
Ah, just throw a fireball at them.

3808
03:56:15,989 --> 03:56:19,319
I could put a wall up.

3809
03:56:19,319 --> 03:56:20,139
Let's do it.

3810
03:56:20,139 --> 03:56:21,170
Let's put a wall up.

3811
03:56:21,170 --> 03:56:22,370
I'm just putting an invisible wall.

3812
03:56:22,370 --> 03:56:23,450
They'll just crash into it.

3813
03:56:23,450 --> 03:56:26,659
Wall.

3814
03:56:26,659 --> 03:56:28,299
You spin the stars into your design,

3815
03:56:28,299 --> 03:56:31,040
throwing up an invisible barrier in front of you.

3816
03:56:31,040 --> 03:56:33,639
The fish collide directly into it one after another,

3817
03:56:33,639 --> 03:56:36,600
falling into the water where they lie stunned.

3818
03:56:36,600 --> 03:56:38,360
The boat moves on.

3819
03:56:38,360 --> 03:56:42,040
And the shoal is left behind.

3820
03:56:42,040 --> 03:56:43,600
Okay.

3821
03:56:43,600 --> 03:56:48,489
Between the islands, near the statues.

3822
03:56:48,489 --> 03:56:55,879
Okay, we're gonna go between the islands?

3823
03:56:55,879 --> 03:56:58,719
Looney Tunes.

3824
03:56:58,719 --> 03:57:00,680
You row the boat onwards across the water.

3825
03:57:00,680 --> 03:57:02,520
The moon is climbing the sky.

3826
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:05,520
You pull on the oar sliding onwards through the water.

3827
03:57:05,520 --> 03:57:08,500
You've never rowed so far or for so long.

3828
03:57:08,500 --> 03:57:11,540
In the fields of Chawberry where you grew up,

3829
03:57:11,540 --> 03:57:14,950
there was no open water beyond a few ponds.

3830
03:57:14,950 --> 03:57:17,860
Nothing to douse the approaching flames.

3831
03:57:17,860 --> 03:57:20,649
It does no good to think of it.

3832
03:57:20,649 --> 03:57:22,370
Turn your thoughts away from home.

3833
03:57:22,370 --> 03:57:24,260
It does no good to think of it.

3834
03:57:24,260 --> 03:57:27,079
And you will most likely never see it again.

3835
03:57:27,079 --> 03:57:29,819
Keep your eyes fixed on the distant shore

3836
03:57:29,819 --> 03:57:35,979
and pull for all you are worth.

3837
03:57:35,979 --> 03:57:47,440
I think we might have to go down this way.

3838
03:57:47,440 --> 03:57:56,489
The moon sets, more stars appear near the island.

3839
03:57:56,489 --> 03:57:57,729
This is now the dead of night.

3840
03:57:57,729 --> 03:58:00,870
You have, you heave on the oars gliding forwards.

3841
03:58:00,870 --> 03:58:04,229
You've come into the sight of a low island.

3842
03:58:04,229 --> 03:58:07,610
Let's go.

3843
03:58:07,610 --> 03:58:09,309
The night air is cold.

3844
03:58:09,309 --> 03:58:11,959
The air is like ice.

3845
03:58:11,959 --> 03:58:15,430
Get out of the boat.

3846
03:58:15,430 --> 03:58:18,250
It is not, I don't wanna go to sleep right here.

3847
03:58:18,250 --> 03:58:20,170
It is night, you would do well to sleep here.

3848
03:58:20,170 --> 03:58:25,920
Oh God, I am fucking screwed.

3849
03:58:25,920 --> 03:58:28,510
He's like 50 feet in front of me.

3850
03:58:28,510 --> 03:58:30,190
Laying your pack down on the shore of the lake,

3851
03:58:30,190 --> 03:58:32,270
you try to rest despite the strange noises

3852
03:58:32,270 --> 03:58:35,040
that float across the landscape.

3853
03:58:35,040 --> 03:58:38,030
Let's eat something.

3854
03:58:38,030 --> 03:58:41,350
You eat the smoked fish and feel much better for it.

3855
03:58:41,350 --> 03:58:43,780
Then you stretch out and rest.

3856
03:58:43,780 --> 03:58:46,799
This is such a flex to sleep here.

3857
03:58:46,799 --> 03:58:49,239
It kind of is.

3858
03:58:49,239 --> 03:58:51,360
The night is restless with visions.

3859
03:58:51,360 --> 03:58:54,219
Once more you are falling into a pit of burning rocks.

3860
03:58:54,219 --> 03:58:57,420
But every time you land, it is only for the stones to melt

3861
03:58:57,459 --> 03:58:59,610
and you tumble down further.

3862
03:58:59,610 --> 03:59:01,969
Through it all, you feel the heat of aniland burning

3863
03:59:01,969 --> 03:59:07,180
should your quest fail.

3864
03:59:07,180 --> 03:59:09,459
You used one provision and you defeated the sun serpent

3865
03:59:09,459 --> 03:59:13,399
and the water serpent, leaving only one more serpent

3866
03:59:13,399 --> 03:59:17,549
to destroy.

3867
03:59:17,549 --> 03:59:20,549
Sun rises above all the waters of the lake.

3868
03:59:20,549 --> 03:59:22,209
The island is a pile of rocks

3869
03:59:22,209 --> 03:59:24,909
as though dumped from a giant's bucket.

3870
03:59:24,909 --> 03:59:27,409
Near the shoreline is the bell for the ferry.

3871
03:59:27,409 --> 03:59:30,329
Drawn up on the shore is your little boat.

3872
03:59:30,329 --> 03:59:35,940
I despise water above all, your brand declares.

3873
03:59:35,940 --> 03:59:40,920
Shut up, here we go.

3874
03:59:45,219 --> 03:59:46,500
You head away from the shoreline

3875
03:59:46,500 --> 03:59:48,379
up the rocky slope of the island.

3876
03:59:48,379 --> 03:59:51,940
There's something very strange about this place.

3877
03:59:51,940 --> 03:59:53,780
The air moves with insects

3878
03:59:53,780 --> 03:59:57,399
who seem sometimes frozen mid-flight.

3879
03:59:57,399 --> 04:00:00,120
But at other moments, spin through the air.

3880
04:00:00,120 --> 04:00:03,260
Clouds stop, shift, then stop once more.

3881
04:00:03,260 --> 04:00:04,799
It is as though the whole island

3882
04:00:04,799 --> 04:00:07,340
is running on ticking clockwork.

3883
04:00:07,340 --> 04:00:09,440
The air shines and glows with the overlapping light

3884
04:00:09,440 --> 04:00:13,340
from the beacons you have converged onto this island.

3885
04:00:13,340 --> 04:00:15,719
It is as though a battle of elemental forces

3886
04:00:15,719 --> 04:00:20,290
being waged in the air itself.

3887
04:00:20,290 --> 04:00:23,799
Look ahead.

3888
04:00:23,799 --> 04:00:26,780
You creep a little up on stony embankments

3889
04:00:26,780 --> 04:00:29,030
to try and peer at what is ahead.

3890
04:00:29,030 --> 04:00:32,579
You make out a bowl-shaped depression in the ground.

3891
04:00:32,579 --> 04:00:34,510
Some kind of pit.

3892
04:00:34,510 --> 04:00:38,719
At its base lies something, a coiled shadow.

3893
04:00:38,719 --> 04:00:42,719
But you cannot make out what it is without going closer.

3894
04:00:42,719 --> 04:00:45,280
Return to the path thoroughly alarmed.

3895
04:00:45,280 --> 04:00:47,129
Keep going.

3896
04:00:47,129 --> 04:00:49,069
You continue climbing up the strange dead slope.

3897
04:00:49,069 --> 04:00:51,290
The path turns and then descends

3898
04:00:51,290 --> 04:00:58,299
into a bowl-shaped what's in the pit.

3899
04:00:58,319 --> 04:01:02,129
You crest the stony rise and look down into the pit below

3900
04:01:02,129 --> 04:01:05,229
where a coiled serpent lies sleeping

3901
04:01:05,229 --> 04:01:07,969
in the middle of the intersecting beams of light

3902
04:01:07,969 --> 04:01:09,799
from the towers.

3903
04:01:09,799 --> 04:01:11,760
The creature has not noticed you yet.

3904
04:01:11,760 --> 04:01:14,649
In fact, it seems to be still,

3905
04:01:14,649 --> 04:01:32,899
the only unmoving thing on this busy, bustling little island.

3906
04:01:32,899 --> 04:01:40,559
Throw a grenade into the hole.

3907
04:01:40,559 --> 04:01:49,299
I'm throwing a grenade.

3908
04:01:49,299 --> 04:01:51,340
You craft the spell over one of your pebbles,

3909
04:01:51,340 --> 04:01:52,840
then you toss the pebble at the serpent

3910
04:01:52,840 --> 04:01:56,790
and it explodes in a glorious, blurry rain.

3911
04:01:56,809 --> 04:02:00,559
You have now defeated all of the seven serpents.

3912
04:02:00,559 --> 04:02:03,909
Something is happening to the island.

3913
04:02:03,909 --> 04:02:06,729
It is alive once more.

3914
04:02:06,729 --> 04:02:09,219
The first thing you notice is the clouds

3915
04:02:09,219 --> 04:02:11,469
as they start to hurry across the sky.

3916
04:02:11,469 --> 04:02:15,389
The grass begins to shift and move in the light wind.

3917
04:02:15,389 --> 04:02:17,829
A few loose rocks skitter down the slope.

3918
04:02:17,829 --> 04:02:19,270
The island is moving once again

3919
04:02:19,270 --> 04:02:21,829
and the light from the beacons fades from view.

3920
04:02:21,829 --> 04:02:22,989
With all the serpents defeated,

3921
04:02:22,989 --> 04:02:24,170
there is nothing stopping you

3922
04:02:24,170 --> 04:02:27,549
from making your way to Manpang.

3923
04:02:27,549 --> 04:02:32,309
I'm sleeping here.

3924
04:02:32,309 --> 04:02:33,389
You take a moment to rest,

3925
04:02:33,389 --> 04:02:37,409
absorbing something of the quiet of the island.

3926
04:02:37,409 --> 04:02:41,139
The sun has not yet crested the last peaks in the east,

3927
04:02:41,139 --> 04:02:43,579
but now your quest will not wait.

3928
04:02:43,579 --> 04:02:45,059
You head back to the shore.

3929
04:02:45,059 --> 04:02:47,209
How was it that easy?

3930
04:02:47,209 --> 04:02:54,659
Well, if you don't do this and you come here,

3931
04:02:54,659 --> 04:02:56,579
well, you know what, you figure it out.

3932
04:02:56,579 --> 04:02:57,420
You do it.

3933
04:02:57,420 --> 04:02:58,239
You do it on your own, right?

3934
04:02:58,239 --> 04:02:59,319
It's fun.

3935
04:02:59,319 --> 04:03:00,159
It's interesting.

3936
04:03:00,159 --> 04:03:00,979
You threw a grenade at him.

3937
04:03:00,979 --> 04:03:03,909
I know.

3938
04:03:03,909 --> 04:03:04,750
It's interesting.

3939
04:03:04,750 --> 04:03:06,590
Don't, I'm not gonna tell us.

3940
04:03:06,590 --> 04:03:07,549
No, I won't tell you.

3941
04:03:07,549 --> 04:03:08,389
Tell us.

3942
04:03:08,389 --> 04:03:13,819
No, no, you can figure it out on your own.

3943
04:03:13,819 --> 04:03:20,629
You spawn camped him, just holding a grenade.

3944
04:03:20,629 --> 04:03:25,729
I will admit, that was probably the lamest way to kill him.

3945
04:03:25,729 --> 04:03:29,620
Or was it?

3946
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:31,200
Dude's just sleeping,

3947
04:03:31,200 --> 04:03:34,159
and I just threw a grenade into his fucking house.

3948
04:03:34,159 --> 04:03:36,159
I mean, that was that, like, it was all right.

3949
04:03:36,159 --> 04:03:40,479
It worked.

3950
04:03:40,479 --> 04:03:42,319
The time has servant.

3951
04:03:42,319 --> 04:03:44,860
I am always.

3952
04:03:44,860 --> 04:03:46,079
I am forever.

3953
04:03:46,079 --> 04:03:47,120
I am before.

3954
04:03:47,120 --> 04:03:51,299
I am after.

3955
04:03:51,299 --> 04:04:07,120
Flashbang going out.

3956
04:04:07,120 --> 04:04:08,239
Who do you think you are?

3957
04:04:08,239 --> 04:04:10,610
I am.

3958
04:04:10,610 --> 04:04:17,920
That's like one of my favorite videos ever.

3959
04:04:17,920 --> 04:04:18,840
What is actually over here?

3960
04:04:18,840 --> 04:04:23,649
Corner of the lake.

3961
04:04:23,649 --> 04:04:25,879
You row the boat onwards across the water.

3962
04:04:25,879 --> 04:04:28,350
As the morning moves on, the wind begins to rise.

3963
04:04:28,350 --> 04:04:30,420
The boat bobs gently.

3964
04:04:30,420 --> 04:04:34,780
You've reached a sheltered cove in the corner of Lake Iklala.

3965
04:04:34,780 --> 04:04:37,649
At the foot of the highest mountain in the horns of Iklala,

3966
04:04:37,649 --> 04:04:42,780
a narrow runoff channel snakes up the mountainside from here.

3967
04:04:42,780 --> 04:04:45,979
What the hell?

3968
04:04:45,979 --> 04:04:46,799
What?

3969
04:04:46,799 --> 04:04:47,809
Why is he gone?

3970
04:04:47,809 --> 04:04:49,969
I don't have a God.

3971
04:04:49,969 --> 04:04:53,930
He hated the water so much that he left permanently?

3972
04:04:53,930 --> 04:04:55,209
That guy sucked.

3973
04:04:55,209 --> 04:04:56,450
You skipped reading it?

3974
04:04:56,450 --> 04:04:57,290
What do you mean?

3975
04:04:57,290 --> 04:04:58,129
What?

3976
04:04:58,129 --> 04:04:59,270
What are you talking about?

3977
04:04:59,270 --> 04:05:04,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what do you mean?

3978
04:05:04,079 --> 04:05:06,959
I skipped reading it.

3979
04:05:06,959 --> 04:05:08,159
Rewind and read.

3980
04:05:08,159 --> 04:05:09,690
Wait, what?

3981
04:05:09,690 --> 04:05:17,950
Did I actually miss that?

3982
04:05:17,950 --> 04:05:30,090
What did it say?

3983
04:05:30,090 --> 04:05:31,469
You return to the shore of the lake.

3984
04:05:31,469 --> 04:05:32,829
The wind makes the bell whistle.

3985
04:05:32,829 --> 04:05:35,139
The boat is bobbing in the shallows.

3986
04:05:35,139 --> 04:05:36,639
I say this.

3987
04:05:36,639 --> 04:05:38,340
Yebran begins.

3988
04:05:38,340 --> 04:05:43,079
But whatever request he was abruptly cut off,

3989
04:05:43,079 --> 04:05:45,360
the voice of Yebran disappears from your mind

3990
04:05:45,360 --> 04:05:47,719
like a dream forgotten at sunrise.

3991
04:05:47,719 --> 04:05:52,370
In its place, there is nothing, only silence.

3992
04:05:52,370 --> 04:05:55,309
I say this.

3993
04:05:55,309 --> 04:05:58,149
Did I actually find like the comedy God?

3994
04:05:58,149 --> 04:06:02,750
Like just the joke God in the game?

3995
04:06:02,750 --> 04:06:10,260
He complained five times and left.

3996
04:06:10,260 --> 04:06:11,579
How did I miss this?

3997
04:06:11,579 --> 04:06:15,899
I didn't even read it.

3998
04:06:15,920 --> 04:06:19,020
Yebran will leave if he complains enough.

3999
04:06:19,020 --> 04:06:21,979
If he complains enough.

4000
04:06:21,979 --> 04:06:24,840
So wait, after getting Yebran,

4001
04:06:24,840 --> 04:06:26,440
you're supposed to stay away from the water

4002
04:06:26,440 --> 04:06:29,229
because he hates water.

4003
04:06:29,229 --> 04:06:31,520
He was about to go off.

4004
04:06:31,520 --> 04:06:34,559
He wrote a fucking like five paragraph text

4005
04:06:34,559 --> 04:06:37,139
he was gonna send me, like telling me off.

4006
04:06:37,139 --> 04:06:37,979
And then he was like, you know what?

4007
04:06:37,979 --> 04:06:39,219
I'm just blocking you and left.

4008
04:06:39,219 --> 04:06:40,760
He didn't even send it.

4009
04:06:40,760 --> 04:06:41,920
He's like, I don't even care.

4010
04:06:41,920 --> 04:06:42,760
Fuck it.

4011
04:06:42,760 --> 04:06:45,870
I'm just blocking you.

4012
04:06:45,870 --> 04:06:48,040
Okay.

4013
04:06:48,040 --> 04:06:49,500
He can randomly complain at certain spots.

4014
04:06:49,500 --> 04:06:56,579
What?

4015
04:06:56,579 --> 04:07:01,100
He was gone in less than an hour of game time.

4016
04:07:01,120 --> 04:07:06,139
It's worth trying to keep him.

4017
04:07:06,139 --> 04:07:09,069
You need him.

4018
04:07:09,069 --> 04:07:13,700
I'll say this, says nothing.

4019
04:07:13,700 --> 04:07:15,420
The ape was always there for you.

4020
04:07:15,420 --> 04:07:17,690
You ditched the ape for this asshole.

4021
04:07:17,690 --> 04:07:21,360
It's a bit late to rewind I think.

4022
04:07:21,360 --> 04:07:23,979
Well, we're godless.

4023
04:07:23,979 --> 04:07:27,200
We're going into episode four, godless.

4024
04:07:27,200 --> 04:07:32,399
Which is interesting because we'll get one.

4025
04:07:32,399 --> 04:07:35,299
That's really funny.

4026
04:07:35,299 --> 04:07:38,639
Okay, well, let's go.

4027
04:07:38,639 --> 04:07:40,440
I say this.

4028
04:07:40,440 --> 04:07:41,520
He gets cut off.

4029
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:50,000
What do you mean he gets cut off?

4030
04:07:50,000 --> 04:07:57,620
What cut him off?

4031
04:07:57,620 --> 04:07:58,840
Your character carries over?

4032
04:07:58,840 --> 04:08:01,049
Yep.

4033
04:08:01,049 --> 04:08:03,709
You row the boat onwards across the water.

4034
04:08:03,709 --> 04:08:07,750
As the sun climbs towards zenith, the winds pick up.

4035
04:08:07,750 --> 04:08:11,370
You have reached the south shore of the lake.

4036
04:08:11,370 --> 04:08:13,489
The magnificent stone harbor is set between

4037
04:08:13,489 --> 04:08:19,690
two towering statues of sorcerers who reach to the sky

4038
04:08:19,690 --> 04:08:24,600
as though to pluck down the constellations directly.

4039
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:28,139
The Zamen Road.

4040
04:08:28,139 --> 04:08:30,540
You could moor and step ashore

4041
04:08:30,540 --> 04:08:33,280
and the road to High Zamen begins from the harbor.

4042
04:08:33,280 --> 04:08:36,139
You have defeated all seven serpents.

4043
04:08:36,139 --> 04:08:41,239
Time then to put ashore and proceed to High Zamen

4044
04:08:41,239 --> 04:08:48,090
and the crown of kings.

4045
04:08:48,090 --> 04:08:52,270
And there it is.

4046
04:08:52,270 --> 04:08:53,889
You row the boat onwards across the water

4047
04:08:53,889 --> 04:08:55,489
and pull up to the shore.

4048
04:08:55,489 --> 04:08:57,379
The sun is hot.

4049
04:08:57,379 --> 04:09:00,420
You have successfully crossed the wastes of Kakabad.

4050
04:09:00,420 --> 04:09:03,709
The road to High Zamen winds southeast from here.

4051
04:09:03,709 --> 04:09:05,469
Now the serpents are defeated.

4052
04:09:05,469 --> 04:09:08,829
The only way is forward.

4053
04:09:08,829 --> 04:09:11,110
Those of you wondering, you can just leave

4054
04:09:11,110 --> 04:09:15,190
without killing any serpents.

4055
04:09:15,190 --> 04:09:21,239
It has some negatives to that.

4056
04:09:21,260 --> 04:09:24,399
You can do it though.

4057
04:09:24,399 --> 04:09:26,569
Look at the statues.

4058
04:09:26,569 --> 04:09:28,209
You look at the towering statues on either side.

4059
04:09:28,209 --> 04:09:31,200
A sorcerer on the left, a sorceress on the right.

4060
04:09:31,200 --> 04:09:32,479
Each lifts a hand to the sky,

4061
04:09:32,479 --> 04:09:34,879
reaching for the power of the stars, winding them,

4062
04:09:34,879 --> 04:09:37,649
moving the constellations with their fingertips.

4063
04:09:37,649 --> 04:09:41,459
The figures show might, power, and confidence.

4064
04:09:41,459 --> 04:09:46,479
Magic, they say, is a force for the betterment of all.

4065
04:09:46,479 --> 04:09:48,420
Lies, of course.

4066
04:09:48,420 --> 04:09:52,350
The archmage craves nothing but power and must be stopped.

4067
04:09:52,350 --> 04:09:55,899
Something glints between the statues' toes.

4068
04:09:55,899 --> 04:09:58,200
Look.

4069
04:09:58,200 --> 04:09:59,760
You look closer.

4070
04:09:59,760 --> 04:10:01,920
Set in the wedge between the fourth and fifth toe

4071
04:10:01,920 --> 04:10:06,479
of the left statue is a small blue crystal.

4072
04:10:06,479 --> 04:10:08,840
Touch the blue crystal.

4073
04:10:08,840 --> 04:10:09,819
You touch the blue crystal

4074
04:10:09,819 --> 04:10:12,889
and you are quickly dizzyingly high.

4075
04:10:12,889 --> 04:10:16,120
Oh, this is if you wanna go back and do anything.

4076
04:10:16,120 --> 04:10:20,809
You can, yeah, you can just travel wherever.

4077
04:10:20,809 --> 04:10:27,659
I don't need to do that though.

4078
04:10:27,659 --> 04:10:30,500
In case you wanna tie up any loose ends or anything,

4079
04:10:30,500 --> 04:10:31,340
you can go back.

4080
04:10:31,340 --> 04:10:33,420
You can go pretty much anywhere.

4081
04:10:33,420 --> 04:10:37,760
You can leave it.

4082
04:10:37,760 --> 04:10:39,360
There's no time to waste.

4083
04:10:39,360 --> 04:10:43,860
The road to Manpang.

4084
04:10:43,860 --> 04:10:46,790
There is no time to waste.

4085
04:10:46,790 --> 04:10:51,500
The Zamen Road.

4086
04:10:51,500 --> 04:10:53,590
You begin the slow climb.

4087
04:10:53,610 --> 04:10:56,530
Ahead, the stony road leads into the Zanzunus

4088
04:10:56,530 --> 04:10:58,290
towards the fortress at Manpang

4089
04:10:58,290 --> 04:11:00,959
and the final stage of your quest.

4090
04:11:00,959 --> 04:11:03,909
You may yet be able to arrive in secret.

4091
04:11:03,909 --> 04:11:08,899
You pass a fallen tree from which a sword hilt protrudes.

4092
04:11:08,899 --> 04:11:11,040
Look at the sword.

4093
04:11:11,040 --> 04:11:12,440
You look at the blade.

4094
04:11:12,440 --> 04:11:15,190
The hilt is that of a very fine blade indeed.

4095
04:11:15,190 --> 04:11:21,629
And scratched into the sword are two words.

4096
04:11:21,629 --> 04:11:24,040
Draw the blade.

4097
04:11:24,040 --> 04:11:25,879
You draw the blade smoothly from the wood.

4098
04:11:25,879 --> 04:11:28,959
It is long, curved, delicately weighted,

4099
04:11:28,959 --> 04:11:31,329
beautifully butterfly sharp.

4100
04:11:31,350 --> 04:11:34,540
This is a blade of the Assassin's Guild no less.

4101
04:11:34,540 --> 04:11:38,459
In the far distance, a shadowy figure disappears from view.

4102
04:11:38,459 --> 04:11:44,579
Ahead as always, you raise the blade in salute.

4103
04:11:44,579 --> 04:11:46,690
Flanker.

4104
04:11:46,690 --> 04:11:50,319
You've taken 24 days to cross the backlands.

4105
04:11:50,319 --> 04:11:51,760
It is almost certain that the Archmage

4106
04:11:51,760 --> 04:11:53,079
has received word of your journey

4107
04:11:53,079 --> 04:11:55,280
by other messengers in that time

4108
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:58,420
who knows who the serpents told before you found them.

4109
04:11:58,420 --> 04:12:00,299
You walk on, what, I took too long?

4110
04:12:00,299 --> 04:12:01,659
I killed all the serpents.

4111
04:12:01,659 --> 04:12:04,459
What do you mean I took too long?

4112
04:12:04,459 --> 04:12:08,420
What, I took too long?

4113
04:12:08,420 --> 04:12:09,930
We're fine.

4114
04:12:09,930 --> 04:12:13,659
Upwards.

4115
04:12:13,680 --> 04:12:15,399
As you walk, you are stopped by a man

4116
04:12:15,399 --> 04:12:17,840
bent double under a great load.

4117
04:12:17,840 --> 04:12:22,450
His presence is most surprising on the empty road.

4118
04:12:22,450 --> 04:12:28,670
You, you're going to High Salmon?

4119
04:12:28,670 --> 04:12:31,129
That is where this road goes.

4120
04:12:31,129 --> 04:12:32,129
I know, I know.

4121
04:12:33,510 --> 04:12:34,930
I'm going home.

4122
04:12:34,930 --> 04:12:38,729
Home is Karima, a little village over the lake,

4123
04:12:38,729 --> 04:12:39,829
over the marsh.

4124
04:12:39,829 --> 04:12:42,680
I'm sure you won't know it.

4125
04:12:42,680 --> 04:12:44,219
I know it.

4126
04:12:44,219 --> 04:12:45,059
Do you?

4127
04:12:45,059 --> 04:12:46,420
I'm glad, I'm glad of that.

4128
04:12:47,899 --> 04:12:53,340
Only I was worried by something I heard about leaving.

4129
04:12:53,360 --> 04:12:55,270
What did you hear?

4130
04:12:55,270 --> 04:12:57,629
Bird men up at the fortress were talking, you see,

4131
04:12:57,629 --> 04:12:59,309
about the beacons.

4132
04:12:59,309 --> 04:13:02,000
They said the beacons were emptying the land.

4133
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:03,299
I'm a simple peasant.

4134
04:13:03,299 --> 04:13:04,479
I don't know anything about magic,

4135
04:13:04,479 --> 04:13:09,260
but I'm headed for home as fast as I can, I'll tell you.

4136
04:13:09,260 --> 04:13:10,639
Emptying it?

4137
04:13:10,639 --> 04:13:13,239
You demand catching his arm, emptying it?

4138
04:13:13,239 --> 04:13:15,629
How can a beacon empty anything?

4139
04:13:15,629 --> 04:13:17,829
That's what they said, that's what they said.

4140
04:13:17,829 --> 04:13:19,989
They said the beacons were wiping out whole villages,

4141
04:13:19,989 --> 04:13:22,170
leaving only bare rock and dust behind.

4142
04:13:22,170 --> 04:13:24,370
Sounded so strange, but then I heard the rumors

4143
04:13:24,370 --> 04:13:26,870
that Timpang had been turned to ruin overnight

4144
04:13:26,870 --> 04:13:29,690
and all the people gone.

4145
04:13:29,690 --> 04:13:30,610
They said it's being done

4146
04:13:30,610 --> 04:13:35,590
by the most evil sorcerer in the land.

4147
04:13:35,590 --> 04:13:37,420
Who was that?

4148
04:13:37,420 --> 04:13:42,340
They called this sorcerer the Anil, Aniland, Aniland.

4149
04:13:42,340 --> 04:13:45,059
Someone saw him turn the light into Karima

4150
04:13:45,059 --> 04:13:48,229
and then it was gone.

4151
04:13:48,229 --> 04:13:50,530
That's not possible.

4152
04:13:50,530 --> 04:13:53,270
I don't know why anyone would wanna do it.

4153
04:13:53,270 --> 04:13:55,190
Karima is a harmless place,

4154
04:13:55,190 --> 04:13:57,590
unless he wants to hurt it to hurt the arch-page,

4155
04:13:57,590 --> 04:13:59,950
I don't know.

4156
04:13:59,950 --> 04:14:02,430
But listen, you look like a strong sorcerer,

4157
04:14:02,430 --> 04:14:03,709
I'll tell you what.

4158
04:14:03,709 --> 04:14:06,889
If you see this sorcerer, Aniland,

4159
04:14:06,889 --> 04:14:12,090
you kill him for us, all right?

4160
04:14:12,090 --> 04:14:17,729
I am the Anilander.

4161
04:14:17,729 --> 04:14:20,129
The man begins to reply, then his mouth falls open

4162
04:14:20,129 --> 04:14:21,049
and he cannot speak.

4163
04:14:21,049 --> 04:14:27,709
He shivers, curse you, you've destroyed us all.

4164
04:14:27,709 --> 04:14:29,370
With that, he shoulders his pack once more

4165
04:14:29,370 --> 04:14:31,069
and hurries down, wait, I just told,

4166
04:14:31,069 --> 04:14:32,829
the whole point of the third game

4167
04:14:32,829 --> 04:14:36,020
is to avoid somebody from telling on me.

4168
04:14:36,020 --> 04:14:38,940
And I just told the guy in the last second of the game,

4169
04:14:38,940 --> 04:14:50,690
he's gonna go tell on me, upwards.

4170
04:14:50,709 --> 04:14:52,829
There was once a grand road.

4171
04:14:52,829 --> 04:14:55,709
There are hints of gold leaf on the corners of the steps,

4172
04:14:55,709 --> 04:14:57,909
carvings and holes for lanterns in the pillars

4173
04:14:57,909 --> 04:14:59,750
that line the way.

4174
04:14:59,750 --> 04:15:03,229
But all has long since fallen into disrepair.

4175
04:15:03,229 --> 04:15:06,209
The only inhabitants remaining are birdmen,

4176
04:15:06,209 --> 04:15:14,329
cursed to the air, that shriek like demons to each other.

4177
04:15:14,329 --> 04:15:16,129
The sun sinks down behind the tallest peaks

4178
04:15:16,129 --> 04:15:18,729
and its dying rays light up a sight you will remember

4179
04:15:18,729 --> 04:15:26,120
for the rest of your days, however few or numerous they are.

4180
04:15:26,120 --> 04:15:29,309
Mampang, tall spires and sharp angles

4181
04:15:29,309 --> 04:15:31,719
make the building look like a rusted blade.

4182
04:15:31,719 --> 04:15:34,329
One thing is certain, entering the fortress

4183
04:15:34,329 --> 04:15:42,360
will undoubtedly be the most perilous stage of your journey.

4184
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:52,020
To Mampang, we did it.

4185
04:15:52,020 --> 04:15:55,229
Your journey across the backlands is complete.

4186
04:15:55,229 --> 04:15:58,010
You took 24 days to cross the backlands.

4187
04:15:58,010 --> 04:15:59,450
In the course of your journey,

4188
04:15:59,450 --> 04:16:03,450
you defeated all seven serpents, including the sun serpent.

4189
04:16:03,450 --> 04:16:07,700
Why do they keep saying that?

4190
04:16:07,700 --> 04:16:09,079
I don't know why they keep saying that.

4191
04:16:09,079 --> 04:16:11,239
They keep saying that.

4192
04:16:11,260 --> 04:16:13,260
You encountered Flanker once more,

4193
04:16:13,260 --> 04:16:16,020
left the Sightmaster Sergeant in his last moments,

4194
04:16:16,020 --> 04:16:18,540
met Elthira, the mystic, twice,

4195
04:16:18,540 --> 04:16:22,219
and met Dintenta, the sorceress of the slopes.

4196
04:16:22,219 --> 04:16:23,739
You lost your little finger.

4197
04:16:23,739 --> 04:16:26,500
You learned that all spells can be countered.

4198
04:16:26,500 --> 04:16:30,420
Of the ram, a statue in Mampang, which can be sung to sleep,

4199
04:16:30,420 --> 04:16:33,700
and not to eat from the larder of Throg.

4200
04:16:33,700 --> 04:16:37,100
You collected a fantastic amount of magical artifacts.

4201
04:16:37,100 --> 04:16:38,700
You are armed with an assassin's sword,

4202
04:16:38,700 --> 04:16:40,979
a longsword, and your original sword,

4203
04:16:40,979 --> 04:16:46,739
and have four rations, 46 gold pieces, and a spell book.

4204
04:16:46,739 --> 04:16:49,639
You don't like goat cheese, no I don't.

4205
04:16:49,639 --> 04:16:55,670
And I'm gonna go like this, because I'm about to get,

4206
04:16:55,670 --> 04:17:04,180
okay, yes, I need to do this.

4207
04:17:04,180 --> 04:17:10,360
Okay, so how this game works is it generates a password

4208
04:17:10,360 --> 04:17:12,329
to take to the next game.

4209
04:17:12,329 --> 04:17:14,729
And I don't want you taking my password,

4210
04:17:14,729 --> 04:17:16,569
because I want us to enjoy it together,

4211
04:17:16,569 --> 04:17:21,520
our journey that we're doing together.

4212
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:25,879
So I gotta write this down.

4213
04:17:25,879 --> 04:17:26,719
Why not?

4214
04:17:26,719 --> 04:17:27,799
Because you'll, because I don't want,

4215
04:17:27,799 --> 04:17:29,139
you'll go through and you'll beat it,

4216
04:17:29,139 --> 04:17:31,840
and you'll take all of my items.

4217
04:17:31,840 --> 04:17:40,780
All right, let me just, I just gotta write this down.

4218
04:17:40,780 --> 04:17:48,229
Yeah, that's episode three.

4219
04:17:48,229 --> 04:17:52,920
Let me write this down.

4220
04:17:52,920 --> 04:17:55,079
Yeah, that's the third episode.

4221
04:17:55,079 --> 04:18:01,909
Part four is, is part four longer than part three?

4222
04:18:01,909 --> 04:18:05,360
I don't know.

4223
04:18:05,360 --> 04:18:16,799
I think part three is one of the biggest ones.

4224
04:18:16,799 --> 04:18:18,520
Two and four, I think, are,

4225
04:18:18,520 --> 04:18:22,049
episode four is please play it tonight.

4226
04:18:22,049 --> 04:18:23,329
No, I think that's it.

4227
04:18:23,329 --> 04:18:30,479
That's, I think that's a perfect place to call it.

4228
04:18:30,479 --> 04:18:33,329
That's a perfect place to call it.

4229
04:18:33,350 --> 04:18:37,370
All right, let's, let's get the ending here.

4230
04:18:37,370 --> 04:18:43,610
Can we see the ending?

4231
04:18:43,610 --> 04:18:52,469
Steve Jackson's Sorcery, part three.

4232
04:18:52,469 --> 04:18:53,590
I forgot to exhale.

4233
04:18:53,590 --> 04:19:00,219
Seven Serpents.

4234
04:19:00,219 --> 04:19:05,459
Fighting Fantasy.

4235
04:19:05,459 --> 04:19:08,270
Yeah, thanks for watching, guys.

4236
04:19:08,270 --> 04:19:12,360
I'm glad I actually came back to it.

4237
04:19:12,360 --> 04:19:18,500
Again, this is a, it's just like such a wonderful experience,

4238
04:19:18,500 --> 04:19:22,049
such a wonderful game.

4239
04:19:22,049 --> 04:19:29,579
Crown of Kings is the last one, book four.

4240
04:19:29,579 --> 04:19:31,739
Published in 27 countries, 22 languages,

4241
04:19:31,760 --> 04:19:35,879
and over 25 million copies sold

4242
04:19:35,879 --> 04:19:38,290
of the Fighting Fantasy series.

4243
04:19:38,290 --> 04:19:39,909
There were dozens of these books.

4244
04:19:39,909 --> 04:19:46,879
Not Sorcery, but other Fighting Fantasy ones.

4245
04:19:46,879 --> 04:19:54,319
It's a lot.

4246
04:19:54,319 --> 04:19:57,899
You know when you're gonna start the next part?

4247
04:19:57,899 --> 04:20:04,530
Um, not, definitely not as long as it took to do this one.

4248
04:20:04,649 --> 04:20:06,489
Honestly, if you guys are,

4249
04:20:06,489 --> 04:20:11,319
isn't, there's a lot of people here right now.

4250
04:20:11,319 --> 04:20:12,760
It seems like a lot of people enjoy it.

4251
04:20:12,760 --> 04:20:17,180
So I'll probably start it in like a week or two.

4252
04:20:17,180 --> 04:20:19,379
I think one of the concerns with playing Sorcery

4253
04:20:19,399 --> 04:20:22,290
for the second time was a lot of you

4254
04:20:22,290 --> 04:20:24,569
that have been here for a long time have already seen it.

4255
04:20:24,569 --> 04:20:26,969
And it was like, oh, we've, have we done everything already?

4256
04:20:26,969 --> 04:20:29,250
But I think it's so new because it's been so long

4257
04:20:29,250 --> 04:20:30,850
and there's so many different ways to play it

4258
04:20:30,850 --> 04:20:36,540
that we could probably start it in a couple of weeks.

4259
04:20:36,540 --> 04:20:37,739
Next stream is gonna be Thursday.

4260
04:20:37,739 --> 04:20:40,770
We're gonna play Tree Pang 2.

4261
04:20:40,770 --> 04:20:42,729
And then on Saturday or Sunday,

4262
04:20:42,729 --> 04:20:45,950
we're gonna do some browser games.

4263
04:20:45,950 --> 04:20:46,790
Thank you for watching.

4264
04:20:46,790 --> 04:20:47,829
That was Sorcery Part Three.

4265
04:20:47,829 --> 04:20:50,370
It has been concluded almost a year later.

4266
04:20:50,370 --> 04:21:02,450
I finally finished it and we'll see you in a few days.

4267
04:21:02,450 --> 04:21:04,399
Take it easy, take care of yourselves.

4268
04:21:04,399 --> 04:21:05,959
Have a great Fourth of July.

4269
04:21:06,860 --> 04:21:13,579
For those of you Americans that celebrate it, Happy Fourth.

4270
04:21:13,579 --> 04:21:19,110
I gotta get the music going, what am I doing?

4271
04:21:19,110 --> 04:21:23,719
Yeah, Happy Fourth of July.

4272
04:21:23,719 --> 04:21:33,559
You need to play something else, you lazy ass.

4273
04:21:33,559 --> 04:21:38,920
Come on, dude.

4274
04:21:38,920 --> 04:21:41,479
Yeah, call your mother, call your mother.

4275
04:21:41,479 --> 04:21:43,610
Call your mother, call your father.

4276
04:21:43,610 --> 04:21:45,799
Have a barbecue with them.

4277
04:21:45,799 --> 04:21:55,739
If you're, you know, in the United States.

4278
04:21:55,739 --> 04:22:04,879
This dude ended at four hours and 20 minutes, stoner.

4279
04:22:04,879 --> 04:22:08,000
No one else is allowed to barbecue.

4280
04:22:08,000 --> 04:22:10,909
You know, barbecue whatever you want.

4281
04:22:10,930 --> 04:22:13,729
I recommend barbecued corn.

4282
04:22:13,729 --> 04:22:17,020
Grilled corn is one of my favorite vegetables.

4283
04:22:17,020 --> 04:22:21,559
Great.

4284
04:22:21,559 --> 04:22:27,350
Would you sing the national anthem?

4285
04:22:27,350 --> 04:22:29,879
Grilled corn is great.

4286
04:22:29,879 --> 04:22:37,760
Grilled corn with a bunch of butter on it, it's the best.

4287
04:22:37,760 --> 04:22:40,000
You're gonna get some steak and corn?

4288
04:22:40,000 --> 04:22:45,979
Hell yeah.

4289
04:22:45,979 --> 04:22:47,780
Yeah, grilled corn goes insane.

4290
04:22:47,780 --> 04:22:58,409
It is very good.

4291
04:22:58,409 --> 04:23:01,069
Been hot lately, yeah.

4292
04:23:01,069 --> 04:23:04,750
It was scorching here.

4293
04:23:04,750 --> 04:23:06,670
I think it's gonna get even hotter tomorrow.

4294
04:23:06,670 --> 04:23:09,440
So those of you in the Southwest,

4295
04:23:09,459 --> 04:23:16,520
in the American Southwest, 110, 115 degrees Fahrenheit.

4296
04:23:16,520 --> 04:23:19,329
Woo, nice elevator conversation.

4297
04:23:19,329 --> 04:23:29,510
Nice elevator conversation, Andy.

4298
04:23:29,510 --> 04:23:31,600
Ah, this is my floor.

4299
04:23:31,600 --> 04:23:32,520
I gotta get off.

4300
04:23:32,520 --> 04:23:36,520
Have a good one.

4301
04:23:36,520 --> 04:23:37,760
See you guys soon, see you on Thursday.

4302
04:23:37,760 --> 04:23:39,930
Happy 4th of July.

4303
04:23:39,930 --> 04:23:40,770
Take it easy.
