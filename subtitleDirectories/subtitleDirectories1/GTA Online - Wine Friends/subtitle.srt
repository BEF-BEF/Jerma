1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,210
Yes, so take some wine please. Someone's buzzing my apartment. I might go see who it is.

2
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:27,579
That's a good berry wine. Who is it? Hey! Hey! It's my good friend MLC Sterls. Come on in.

3
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:35,020
I've got some fresh wine for you. See it's right here. It's a Cabernet from the year 1444.

4
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:42,490
This is your Christopher Columbus sail to sea. Do you know that? I love Cabernet. Yes, yes it's good.

5
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:54,679
Take some please. Please have some. Please have some please. Ah yes. Now you. Let's have some more

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:07,400
wine. Let's have some more wine. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yes. Oh yes. What's this? Is it wine? I haven't had

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,349
this in so long. It's been at least five seconds since my last glass. My screen is shaking.

8
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,670
There is a dude behind us. We better get going. He's behind us. Maybe there's a dude behind us.

9
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,989
He's coming. There's a guy behind us. Maybe he's just gonna get in the car. He's gonna get in the

10
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:27,670
car. Is he just gonna get in? There's not enough space in the car. He's gonna shoot us. It's a two

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:36,069
door. We better leave. No, it's a two door. He's kicking the door. Hey, cut it out. He has a knife.

12
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:42,650
Put the knife down. There's no reason for this. Look, let me get out and I'll like just listen.

13
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,129
I know I have your insurance. My insurance. We'll work things out. We'll exchange papers.

14
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:59,719
I'll send it to you tomorrow. Take us up to the top of this fucking mountain. This looks really

15
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:07,750
stupid. Why? I'm in first person just behind you and it looks like it looks like one of those old

16
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,789
80s movies where you're in front of like a green screen and you're like apparently driving right

17
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:23,180
now. Oh wow, look out. This looks really great on my fucking green screen. This looks so stupid.

18
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:47,830
I'm just like eating. Oh my god, that is 90 degrees. That was 90 degrees. Yeah,

19
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,189
I don't think I'll be able to get down the whole mountain. You're gonna try to get down the whole

20
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:57,909
mountain like that. Sure. Oh no. Speaking of going down the whole mountain. Oh no.

21
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,939
This is a terrible place to do this. I don't know why I keep trying to do that.

22
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:12,060
It's not gonna happen. Okay, see ya. See ya. Oh I'm alive.

23
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:28,469
And here's the mountain. Push me. All my lights, bro. Push me. Push me. I need a push.

24
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:37,319
Push me, mummy. Push me, mummy. Thank you for the boost. Oh no, you're fine. You fucking idiot.

25
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:44,259
My bike. You need to land this plane and the nose has to be directly in front of me just like that

26
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:52,120
movie Supergun with Thomas Cruise. I'm going really fast. You are going like kind of fast,

27
00:03:52,120 --> 00:04:03,740
but it's okay. You'll get it. Yeah, you did it. Can you take a selfie? No, I just have it like

28
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:14,009
zoomed in on your face. Oh no. Oh no. That's great. That's good. That's great.

29
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,850
Your guy's face is as if nothing is happening.

30
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:41,319
He is like, I've got a big deal. I'm just driving. Well, oh well. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

31
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:46,600
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second. Don't move. Do not move. I can't move.

32
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,279
Hold on. Don't, don't, don't, don't. I want to get like a first person look at you.

33
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,279
I want to like take a picture of you. I'm rocking out to the music. What are you doing? Yeah,

34
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:10,680
you're rocking out to the music. What a sick fuck. It's scary on my wayward son. Your character is

35
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:27,980
a psycho. How beautiful of a sight is this? Hey, I just love sitting here parked looking outside

36
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:45,579
of the wonderful islands and all the other great stuff in this wonderful world. Oh my gosh. This

37
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:54,259
game is so fun just to drive over mountains, the fly. All right. Caps coming. All right. Well,

38
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,990
I got us a cab. Do we both get in the cab? Um, I don't know. Well, don't get in it yet.

39
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,199
Okay. Um, hi. That's not a cab. That's not a cab at all. That's a, uh,

40
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,290
what kind of cab company sends a fucking chopper and shoots you.

41
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:40,889
This bottle is from Thomas Jefferson, circa 17 BC. Let's get, oh yeah, that's got some aroma to it.

42
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,180
Oh yes, that's got a very nice little flavor to it. Kind of reminds me of poison.
