1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,080
Trees. Found trees. Found them. Right there.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,400
We can all calm down now. I found the trees.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,400
And I am gonna starve to death. Oh my god.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,699
Do I have any- I have, like, food, right?

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,039
What if I eat the raw beef? Does it give me, like, E. coli?

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,539
Oh, it doesn't- the rotting flesh is, like, better.

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:29,980
No, it's not. Not at all.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,009
Alright, tree. There we are.

9
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,689
No, I don't have a- nooo!

10
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:43,880
Is this the only tree here?

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,079
You're killing me!

12
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:52,229
I need at least, like, a stack of wood to create my floor.

13
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:54,750
My wooden paneling floor.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,250
Cause I wanna- I wanna look like a rich person.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,500
Is that really the only damn tree here?

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,400
The nec- look, okay, look. The next tree is over there.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,099
Oh my god.

18
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,599
I would sprint, but I don't wanna lose all my hunger.

19
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,959
Cause that would be bad.

20
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,760
I'm just gonna eat all this rotten raw beef.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,159
Let's see if I get salmonella.

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,769
Alright, so far so good.

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,760
Oh yeah.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,159
I wanna get up to that stupid tree up there.

25
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,579
Alright, you've had your fun. Time for you to die.

26
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,879
I'm only level two.

27
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,379
Is that because I've died so many times?

28
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:43,700
Alright, I have to make the trek up this mountain.

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,799
To get this stupid tree.

30
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,500
I haven't been leaving the breadcrumb trail.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,099
I'm gonna get lost.

32
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,900
And I'm never gonna find the house again.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,799
I think I'll be alright.

34
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,000
I can see there's a torch over there.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,510
I have to get up to this one other tree up here.

36
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,579
This is ridiculous.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,109
One damn tree at the top of a mountain.

38
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,609
What?

39
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:07,709
Where the hell did you even come from?

40
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,860
I'm knocking you off the cliff like I did your brother.

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,259
Where is he?

42
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,050
Get out of here.

43
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,050
Get out of here.

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,849
Oh, whatever.

45
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,650
You can just, I'm just gonna go away.

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,560
Go away, I'll take it, I'll take it.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,169
Nice, level three.

48
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:29,270
Oh, already this is gonna be cruel.

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,469
This cow.

50
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:31,969
Oh, I can watch the sunset.

51
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,710
I'm gonna knock this cow off.

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,979
Sorry cow, but you had it coming.

53
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:40,849
Plus I want your meat.

54
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,389
I want your meat.

55
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,930
Look at this.

56
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,379
Now see.

57
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,580
Now see, this is what it's all about, guys.

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,400
Watching the sunrise on the top of a mountain.

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,909
Looking down at all the beautiful stuff.

60
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,659
Oh, sorry cow.

61
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:09,120
Oh man.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,919
Come on, I can't believe I need to find some more trees.

63
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,909
This is bad.

64
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,979
How many wooden planks am I gonna get out of this?

65
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:21,680
If I'm gonna get at least a stack of 64 wooden planks,

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,419
I should be able to cover my whole ground level.

67
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:28,719
And not even close.

68
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,419
Kinda close, though.

69
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,490
Actually, no, I got some of these, so okay.

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,490
If I can get one more tree.

71
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,289
Where's one more tree?

72
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,090
Oh, yeah, right down there.

73
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,449
All right, I need to go.

74
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,460
Oh no.

75
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,860
Wait, hold on.

76
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,360
Okay, it's this way.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,530
That's the way I gotta go.

78
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,729
There's a tree right there, too.

79
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,330
I'll take that tree and just go home,

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,530
because I'm gonna get lost.

81
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,110
Oh!

82
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,710
That was close.

83
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,780
I was actually very terrified about that one.

84
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,569
Let's go!

85
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,879
Let's get this last tree and then go home

86
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,780
so I can build the rest of my floor.

87
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,750
God.

88
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,990
Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.

89
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,420
Okay, let's see if I can't get some floor out of that.

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
So there's one of my torches.

91
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,819
I see it.

92
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:26,139
They see my breadcrumb trail I left.

93
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,370
So far, so good.

94
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,230
Give me more of these so I can make some pita bread.

95
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,930
All right, as I go, I'm gonna take the torches back,

96
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,240
because that's a waste.

97
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:50,149
Whoop!

98
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:54,060
Excellent.

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:09,379
Excellente.

100
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,889
Blink.

101
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,439
Boink.

102
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,240
Okay, so I'm on my way back,

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,740
and I went all the way this way,

104
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,740
all the way down there,

105
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,240
way past that thing up on a mountain,

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,069
and there was a whole forest right there.

107
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:30,569
So...

108
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,350
Yeah.

109
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,439
Whoops!

110
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,860
I'll come back to that later.

111
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,759
We've collected the trees.

112
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,959
We've collected the wood.

113
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:50,560
Time to go back home and build up the house like we should.

114
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,060
There's no reason to fear, and there's no reason to fret.

115
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
There's a creeper in my house!

116
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Oh, I can't!

117
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,060
Oh, God!

118
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
Get away from me!

119
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,459
Don't ruin my house!

120
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:02,759
Don't ruin my house!

121
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,160
You...

122
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,860
Come here! That's right!

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,560
Come over here!

124
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,189
Come over here!

125
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:10,560
You ruined my song, you piece of shit!

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,800
How...

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,920
My boat!

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,949
Oh...

129
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,639
Okay, is there anybody else in the damn house?

130
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,740
Okay.

131
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,040
I think we're good.
