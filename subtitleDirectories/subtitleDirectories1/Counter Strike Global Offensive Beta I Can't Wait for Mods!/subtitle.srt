00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:15,609
Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Counter-Strike Global Offensive Gameplay Commentary.

2
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:21,609
And before I get into this video at all, I gotta thank special thanks somebody for this Beta Key.

3
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,129
Because this game, if you don't know, is very, very hard to get a Beta Key for.

4
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:33,350
You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to get a Counter-Strike Go Beta Key.

5
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,909
So thank you so, so much to the person that gave this to me.

6
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:41,350
Because I didn't get this on my own, somebody gave me this.

7
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,390
And they don't want their name in the video, and I can totally understand that.

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:51,880
But Anonymous, thank you so, so much dude. You don't know how long I've been looking for one of these damn keys.

9
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,600
And a follow-up to this, if you want to get into the Beta and you don't know how,

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,320
there is really only one way you can do it.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,560
You have to go to the Counter-Strike website, or I think you can do it through Steam as well.

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,400
You have to do their survey. There's a Counter-Strike survey you can take.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,359
You fill it out and you get put on the list, I guess.

14
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,500
I did it a long time ago and I still haven't been called.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,400
But I'm pretty certain that's the only way you can do it.

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,760
So now, what do I think of this game? Do I think this is a fun game?

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,359
I've played it for a couple hours now. I've got maybe three or four hours into it.

18
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,480
And this game is great. It is a lot of fun guys.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,319
I can't wait till this actually comes out. Because the best part about Counter-Strike,

20
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:36,120
to me at least, in my opinion, is not the default game modes.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,840
When this game finally releases and the modders and the map makers get their hands on it,

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,959
that's when I have the most fun in Counter-Strike.

23
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,439
I'll give you two very good specific examples. One of them is Jailbreak.

24
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,680
If you've never played Jailbreak before, it is hysterical.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,280
It is one of the funnest mods I've ever played in any game.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,849
And I probably dumped in, god, probably a hundred plus hours into CS Source's Jailbreak.

27
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:08,009
And when they finally get their hands on it and they make CS GO Jailbreak,

28
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,729
you better believe I'm going to be playing that a ton.

29
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,699
I actually might do videos on that, to be honest.

30
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:16,659
There could be some really funny content coming out of Jailbreak.

31
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,580
Very briefly, I'll tell you what it is. I didn't even tell you what the hell the mode was.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,900
Jailbreak is there's two sides. There's the prisoners and then the prison guards.

33
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,659
And the whole goal is you're supposed to follow the rules as the prisoners.

34
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,500
They open up the gates and they go,

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Prisoners come out, everyone listen to me.

36
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,900
And I want you all to walk ten paces to your left.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,780
And Simon says jump.

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,020
And if you didn't jump, they would just shoot you.

39
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,300
So it's stuff like that.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,780
And if you were a prisoner, every time I was a prisoner, I would never follow the rules.

41
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,259
I would always like just, oh, Simon says jump.

42
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:52,340
And then I would just run at him and just start stabbing him.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,419
And sometimes it would work and you could pick up their gun

44
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,539
because you don't start with a gun.

45
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,139
It's just crazy. Maybe I'll do a video. I don't even know.

46
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,889
We'll see in the future.

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,930
But other than Jailbreak, really, probably Ice World.

48
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,610
I know there's going to be a new Ice World.

49
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,889
There's always an Ice World in every Counter-Strike.

50
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,169
So Ice World, probably Snow World, but there was a Snow World, wasn't there?

51
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:17,050
Just that tiny close quarter death match where all the guns are on the ground.

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,849
And then you could only buy things if you were standing in the middle.

53
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,370
But it was almost impossible to stand in the middle because the map was so tiny

54
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,300
and bullets are just flying everywhere.

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,860
I can't wait.

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,699
But anyways, let's start talking about what's actually happening on the screen

57
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:33,860
and what I think of this game for real.

58
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,500
The actual game, not the mods or the potential maps they're going to make for it.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
This game is pretty fast paced.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,270
Most games in Counter-Strike will last less than one or two minutes for the whole round.

61
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,990
And that's great because if you don't know, when you die in this game, you don't come back.

62
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,849
It's just like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2 or the Search and Destroy in Call of Duty.

63
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,379
Same exact premise, when you die, you're permanently dead.

64
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,580
And it is so refreshing knowing that these rounds are not going to last more than two minutes.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,979
I have OCD, I got ADHD, guys.

66
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:14,500
I am one of those people that cannot stand no action for more than 10 seconds.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,220
If I die in Counter-Strike at the beginning of a round,

68
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,060
I am so tempted to just hit escape and go to quit game, exit game, and go find another lobby

69
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,300
because it's like pulling teeth for me.

70
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,500
Sitting there for more than a couple minutes is pretty much the equivalent

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,300
of me punching myself in my own face 10 times.

72
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,639
I don't know if it's like that for anybody else, but it's like that for me.

73
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,800
And really besides that, the only real complaint I have about this game

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,560
has nothing to do with the guns, has nothing to do with the gun mechanics.

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,079
Because, I mean, they're all pretty balanced.

76
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,319
The recoil is pretty easy to get used to.

77
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,800
The reload times can be kind of slow on some of the weapons,

78
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,839
and the AK-47 is a little odd with its recoil.

79
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,839
But for the most part, it's a pretty balanced game.

80
00:04:54,839 --> 00:05:00,759
The problem that I have is, shooting somebody in the chest or in any of their body parts,

81
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,560
it takes a lot of bullets to kill them.

82
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,759
And especially when you can get that one lucky headshot on somebody and kill them instantly.

83
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,199
And I know that it has a lot to do with Kevlar in this game.

84
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,040
But really, when I come around a corner, I've jumped around corners before spraying,

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,000
and I've unloaded almost a whole clip on somebody's chest.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
And then I just get insta-headshotted.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,300
And it's really discouraging, and I know I have to just practice on my aiming,

88
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,060
get those headshots down.

89
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,339
But it can get discouraging, especially when you get the jump on somebody.

90
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,500
That's my only real complaint I have.

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,850
So that is going to wrap up this particular video on CSGO.

92
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,009
I'll leave you with a pretty gruesome headshot I got on somebody.

93
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:46,250
So hopefully you enjoy that, and I will see you guys all next time.

94
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,050
So take care, everybody.
