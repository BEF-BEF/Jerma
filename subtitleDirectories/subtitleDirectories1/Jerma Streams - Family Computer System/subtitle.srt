1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,839
How are you doing?

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:08,019
How are we? Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, now we're good.

3
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,269
What's going on? Happy New Year, everybody.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:21,219
Officially, right? Last time I saw you, it was still December 31st, Pacific time.

5
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,390
Catboy. Yeah, I know, I know. Look. Look.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,939
I didn't tell you when I had that- I didn't say,

7
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:37,380
hey guys, the next stream is gonna be me in a catboy outfit.

8
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,609
I just said, at some point, over the years,

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,619
over the years, I was gonna get into a catboy costume.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,039
No, it has to happen this year. Don't worry.

11
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,859
It's gonna happen in the next- Okay, I'll give you a-

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,420
Look, it's gonna happen in the next, like, three to six months, okay?

13
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,489
I didn't say I'm gonna wear a catboy costume next weekend.

14
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:10,709
You won't even know when it's gonna happen.

15
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,959
It's just going to one day. And I don't want you to know the date.

16
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,530
Scammed? Dude, chat is in shambles right now.

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,060
But yeah, hopefully you had a good New Year's Eve.

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,549
I bought you for Eastern time, but took off around 10 or 11 PM Pacific.

19
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:49,260
And today, we're gonna do something that I haven't really done on this channel before.

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,280
I mean, I've kind of done a version of it, but I saw this little device,

21
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,200
and I had to have it, and I have to play it.

22
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:06,359
This is a knockoff Nintendo. It's shaped like the Nintendo.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,319
It looks like the Nintendo. I just had to own it.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,949
There are 620 fake Nintendo games on this console.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,620
I don't know how many of them are real. I just saw this and I had to get it.

26
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,060
I've seen Vinny do this shit before. I've seen Joel do this shit before.

27
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,740
And these are usually a fucking mess.

28
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,659
They are the kings of these devices, I would say.

29
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:34,659
I'm just a measly peasant in their presence.

30
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,240
So I have no idea what this one is. I just saw it and I had to buy it.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,300
Yeah, I've done the 700,000 games before, but never a-

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,060
Never like one you just plug into your TV.

33
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,550
Eat a Whopper? Tomorrow's the Whopper stream.

34
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,310
I gotta tweet this stream out. Hold on.

35
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,699
Yeah, this is called the Family Computer System.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,319
Yeah, tomorrow is Whopper's stream.

37
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,379
A few weeks ago, I played that game, Black Masses,

38
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,379
and that joke is gonna happen tomorrow.

39
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,180
So a bunch of people probably have no idea what's gonna happen with that

40
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,860
routine, in quotes.

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,810
But for those of you that were there, cool.

42
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,889
I think I'm gonna have fun. I don't even care.

43
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,159
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:36,460
I can't fucking wait.

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,539
That's gonna be like my favorite stream of the year.

46
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:45,909
Part of me only wants that stream to be an hour long.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,770
It's just the whole thing.

48
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,699
But we'll see. I don't know.

49
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,219
Let's see how much that makes me laugh.

50
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,340
Catboy stream.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,860
You'll get the Catboy stream.

52
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:01,939
Okay, guys, okay, let me just break this down for you.

53
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:07,110
So yesterday, two days ago was New Year's Day.

54
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:11,430
But you expected me to go get an entire Catboy costume

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,590
and have Catboy makeup put on me in 24 hours?

56
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,689
No, I'm doing this legit.

57
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,410
I'm not just gonna go get a pair of ears at the dollar store, okay?

58
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,699
Just hold on, give me some time.

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,100
He's dedicated.

60
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,110
Yeah, well, it's gonna be my version of that image.

61
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,029
All right, let's go.

62
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:45,829
Let's play.

63
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:46,550
It's time to play.

64
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,670
So this is gonna be an interesting thing we do here.

65
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,230
I'm just gonna play this the way that I'm gonna play it on the screen right now,

66
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,069
or two random number generators.

67
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,459
Remember, there are 620 on this console.

68
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,009
And how this is gonna work is I'm going to roll this.

69
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:07,529
This is just whatever this lands on.

70
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:08,730
This is what I'm gonna play.

71
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,360
And whatever one this is on,

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,339
this is the amount of time I have to play it in minutes, okay?

73
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:15,610
People say, show the console, sure.

74
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,620
I'll show the family computer system.

75
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:27,139
So here it is.

76
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,379
Is it right here?

77
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,870
Can you see it?

78
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,069
Not the Nintendo Entertainment System,

79
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,370
the family computer system.

80
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,269
So, you know, well, hopefully this is fun.

81
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,920
I have to delay my audio by almost two and a half full seconds, by the way,

82
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,149
to be able to stream this and capture it.

83
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,430
So we might be completely out of sync right now.

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,709
I have no idea.

85
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,149
I tried desperately.

86
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:00,870
Let's test it.

87
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,790
One, two, three, four, five.

88
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,689
How's that?

89
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:04,889
Do I have to adjust it?

90
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,490
One, two, three, four.

91
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:15,699
One, two, three, four, one.

92
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,180
Good?

93
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,060
All right, let's go.

94
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,339
All right, good, good, good, good.

95
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,620
All right, so what do we got first?

96
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:27,560
The first one we're going to play, we're going to go to 162.

97
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,930
And I have to play 162 for two minutes.

98
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:32,490
Okay, good.

99
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:32,970
That's good.

100
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,490
All right, let's go to 162.

101
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,810
By the way, Mortal Kombat 4 with a C.

102
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,379
That's, I mean, there's a lot here.

103
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:43,860
Oh, what is it?

104
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,660
162?

105
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,459
162.

106
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,540
This one's called Duck.

107
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,439
This might be just Duck Hunt.

108
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,480
Oh, I'll show the controller too.

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,459
The controller's funny.

110
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,120
Look at this fucking thing.

111
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,959
So it looks kind of normal until they decided to add, like, mirror buttons.

112
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,250
They'll look here.

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,899
Oh, what the fuck?

114
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:18,069
There's just four buttons.

115
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,509
And it's A, B, T, A, and T, B.

116
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:24,550
And I tried to read the instruction manual to find out what the fuck that meant.

117
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,269
I have no idea what that means.

118
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:37,290
It gives, like, an incredibly unclear explanation of what that actually is.

119
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:37,689
Turbo?

120
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:38,810
Yeah, but it doesn't do anything.

121
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,220
All right, let's go to Duck.

122
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,980
It's time for Duck, and I got to play this for two minutes.

123
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,540
By the way, when I get to a point where I want to see

124
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,620
times up spammed in chat, please.

125
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,540
When I get the time, I probably shouldn't have told you to do that.

126
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,259
Whatever, Duck.

127
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,160
I already love it.

128
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,040
It's like Dig Dug?

129
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,699
Oh, shit, I got to get these off screen.

130
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,100
Stage one.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,639
Duck.

132
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,060
How do you play?

133
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:17,180
I win?

134
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,899
Oh, okay, you have to bring the egg to the bottom.

135
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,180
Oh, it is like Dig Dug.

136
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,899
Did I lose?

137
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,779
Oh, shit, okay, hold on.

138
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:27,579
This is cute, man.

139
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,699
This is not even, like, bad.

140
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,139
This is, like, fun.

141
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,909
What is it?

142
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,549
Is it a dog?

143
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,009
It's times up.

144
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,850
It's not times up yet.

145
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,629
Oh, the egg broke.

146
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,470
Okay, you can't drop that far.

147
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,860
I got one more minute.

148
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,779
I have one minute left in Duck.

149
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,860
All right, don't touch the green stuff.

150
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,139
Wait, does it matter?

151
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,370
Because it can't fall that far.

152
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,159
All right, let's get a heart.

153
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,909
Oops, oops.

154
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,019
I didn't know Jerma was a retro gamer.

155
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,200
Oh, I think I blew it.

156
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,799
Did I blow it?

157
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,769
No, I'm not done with Duck yet.

158
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:20,970
I'm not done, I'm not done, I'm not done.

159
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,490
I want to get to the bottom of Duck.

160
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,889
Hold on.

161
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,730
I like this one.

162
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,830
Times up.

163
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,389
It doesn't matter.

164
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,899
Oh my god, I get times up.

165
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:35,159
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, time's up.

166
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,720
God damn it.

167
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,679
I wanted to play that one.

168
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,320
Maybe I'll go back.

169
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,600
Okay, keep Duck on the list.

170
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,580
All right, what's up?

171
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:40,980
What's next?

172
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,490
All right, 169 for seven minutes.

173
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,850
169.

174
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,009
What the hell is random number generator?

175
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,700
169 is gyrodine.

176
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,149
And I see right now it is almost 11 minutes.

177
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,549
So at 18 minutes is when I have to stop playing this.

178
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,549
This is, I probably should have made it five minutes,

179
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,309
but whatever, I have to sleep in the bed that I made.

180
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, gyrodine in three, two, one, go.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,669
Okay, gyrodine.

182
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,519
Whatever, what's going on?

183
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,799
Oh, it's a helicopter auto-scroller.

184
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:34,100
Shit.

185
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,820
How do I kill things?

186
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,700
I can't hurt anything?

187
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:43,269
What?

188
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:48,470
Why can't, why do my bullets not hurt stuff?

189
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,190
Is it over?

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,690
That sucks.

191
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,210
It's like a laser tag weapon.

192
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,210
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

193
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,570
Okay, I was pressing, wait.

194
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,669
There's two guns.

195
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,110
There's this one, this is just lights,

196
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,220
and this one is real bullets.

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,179
No, it's not.

198
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,379
Oh, that's the ground.

199
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,460
Holy shit, okay, this is air and this is ground.

200
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,370
How am I shooting the cars?

201
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,289
Oh, fuck man, gyrodine's pretty good.

202
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:17,379
I'm liking gyrodine so far.

203
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:29,750
They just look like crumpled up pieces of paper.

204
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,820
I wonder if this is a boss.

205
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,740
I mean, this is just somebody sketched these in five seconds.

206
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,779
I can do this.

207
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,059
I can sketch these tanks.

208
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:46,220
They're not even symmetrical either.

209
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,340
Oh shit, watch out, jets.

210
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,070
I can't fucking believe I just lost right there.

211
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,629
God damn it.

212
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,590
Please spawn right here.

213
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,389
Oh my God.

214
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,070
Wait, no, no, it's like a checkpoint.

215
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,629
Just play Ace Combat instead.

216
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:14,659
You can't really compare gyrodine to Ace Combat.

217
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,100
Oh my fucking God.

218
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,580
No, it's the control is hard.

219
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,740
Why can't you, why can't, why not?

220
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,590
Well, because the Ace Combat is a,

221
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,730
this game was made in probably 30 minutes.

222
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,690
Ace Combat has a team of like 200 people that worked on it.

223
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,450
For like four years.

224
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:43,450
You don't just take raw hamburger meat out of the refrigerator.

225
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,559
Put it on a plate and say,

226
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,840
this is the same thing as the five-star restaurant.

227
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,720
Eat my fucking hamburger meat instead.

228
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,220
I have literally no idea what that meant, by the way.

229
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,620
Like I have no idea what that meant.

230
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,230
I said what I, the sentence I just said,

231
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,389
I'm saying it like internally in my head now.

232
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,950
And like the point I was trying to make is kind of there somewhere,

233
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,389
but like I don't know where it was.

234
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,269
It was in there somewhere.

235
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,889
If you deconstruct that whole sentence,

236
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:18,889
you'll be able to like find out what I was trying to say.

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,779
It was in there somewhere.

238
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,580
He's zonked.

239
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,259
No, I'm not, not today.

240
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:33,059
Stop drinking bong water.

241
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,580
All right, if I don't get to the end,

242
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm going to be very mad.

243
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,659
This is not even hard.

244
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:46,519
Like I played like 4,000 hours of Binding of Isaac.

245
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,480
I can't beat Gyrodyne.

246
00:13:49,480 --> 00:14:00,919
I mean, the controller is kind of hard to use.

247
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:03,029
Oh my God, give me a break.

248
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:03,750
Fuck this game.

249
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:04,870
It sucks.

250
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:06,580
Never mind.

251
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,059
It's funny.

252
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,679
These are excuses.

253
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,379
No, they're not.

254
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,590
They're...

255
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,389
Look, all right, the controller sucks.

256
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,500
I press left and sometimes it doesn't go left.

257
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,620
Sometimes it just sits there.

258
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,970
They 3D printed these controllers, like a thousand of them.

259
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,799
It's hard to use.

260
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,240
It's fucking hard to do.

261
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,940
How much more time is left on this one?

262
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,710
Two minutes?

263
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,429
All right, whatever.

264
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:47,909
I got it.

265
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,220
You know what?

266
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,019
Right works fine.

267
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:53,740
Up works fine.

268
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,539
Down works fine.

269
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:55,340
It's left.

270
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,539
Left like doesn't want to...

271
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,220
If you have to push hard.

272
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:05,539
There's a dev in the chat.

273
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,100
Well, I highly doubt that.

274
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,659
I'm trying to pick up the mermaid and it got me killed.

275
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,259
I can't even get past the first two screens of Gyrodyne.

276
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:15,700
This is making me angry.

277
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,980
Dev of Gyrodyne.

278
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,230
Why am I tapping when I could just be holding?

279
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,399
Stop pretending.

280
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm not pretending.

281
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,720
It's hard.

282
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,059
You get on General Mills presents Gyrodyne,

283
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,539
and you tell me how difficult it is to move around.

284
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,139
There you go.

285
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,110
There you go.

286
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,750
Watch out, watch out.

287
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,600
Hurry, do the famous Gyrodyne cheat code.

288
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,879
Oh, you're right.

289
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,639
Up, up, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, down, down.

290
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,960
B, A, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, B, A, B, A.

291
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,159
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

292
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:24,039
B, A, B, B, A, back, B, I, B, O, B, O, B, O, B.

293
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,909
Did I get it?

294
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,350
No, I was too slow.

295
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:43,509
I really don't want to be playing Gyrodyne anymore.

296
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,139
We're going to follow the rules.

297
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,179
I can't break the rules.

298
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:51,580
I have to keep playing.

299
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,220
30 seconds.

300
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,379
All right.

301
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,539
This is going to be the last life, so I better make it count.

302
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,899
I'm just going to dodge and not care about anything but dodging.

303
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,389
But I move slower than they do.

304
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,429
That's why this is so difficult.

305
00:17:03,429 --> 00:17:05,380
I move slower than the bullets.

306
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,819
I move slower than all the other things.

307
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,539
And I made it.

308
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:16,789
I made it, I'm good.

309
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,509
I feel like I'm looking at the Chrono Trigger overworld map.

310
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,740
God, that makes me want to play that game. Let's just play that game tomorrow. No, no, no, no, no

311
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:34,970
No, don't lie to them. Don't lie to them. They'll fucking sniff you out. Don't lie to them. Where are these cars driving?

312
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,109
Why are they driving up here?

313
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:46,490
Off-road, I guess. All right. Oh, I made it. It's the first I've ever been in Jaredine. I can't even see the bullets

314
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:53,529
Wow, it looks so much better on your guy's screen. I'm not even kidding from my monitor

315
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:58,420
It looks like dog shit, but on your on your screen. It looks wicked good on my screen

316
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,220
It looks like shit when it's why is it? Why is that? How can your screen look so much better than my screen?

317
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:11,769
Whatever. No, it really does. I couldn't see those bullets. I looked over at my preview monitor

318
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:21,210
I can see them clearly and we're going next. It was Jaredine. It was pretty sick. There we go. 299 for

319
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:38,420
Three minutes. Okay, I can do that. 299 pong pong for three minutes. All right, let's play pong pong

320
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:47,670
I'm gonna start the uh, so 1930. Let's start and I'm gonna guess this is pong

321
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,500
If it's not pong then I don't know what it is pong pong stage one

322
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:05,450
Um, what the fuck is happening? What am I driving? Am I a car? Okay. I'm orange car

323
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,670
I have a bullets or guns or anything. Is it just bumper cars?

324
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,150
Wait a minute. Is this just a mario party game where you have to bump like yoshi and luigi off the edge

325
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:27,740
I think that's what this is. I don't

326
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,859
I don't know what the goal is

327
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:35,099
I have to just dump them into the corners

328
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,559
I don't have no fucking idea of it

329
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Uh, what if I drive into one?

330
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,349
Oh, I was killed but I can't look at when I bump into them they don't go the direction you think they're gonna go

331
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,299
This doesn't make any fucking sense

332
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:00,619
I don't have any bullets or anything either

333
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,819
See like you think they would they would bounce backwards

334
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,079
But i'm I go for much

335
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,519
Why did I switch with him? What the what how is that even fucking possible?

336
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,109
What?

337
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:30,630
We switched places

338
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:37,539
Get in there

339
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:46,039
Oh, I don't have to do it. Wait, there's two more left. Hey jerma, i'm the dev of what is what is this?

340
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,599
I look honestly. I don't care what's happening in the game right now. I'm gonna read this

341
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,069
Hey, i'm the dev of jarodon. This game was the work of two years of work with myself another dev

342
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,269
He ended up with my wife and I lost custody of my children. Okay. Well

343
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,420
I'm the dev of jarodon. All right, it's not even careful. How much time is left 19

344
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
20 21 22. I have like 40 seconds

345
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,269
This is by far the worst one yet. This is the worst one yet

346
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:38,630
I cannot bump them when I get close enough. I just I switch places with them 22 30, right? All right

347
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,549
I don't even care. I'm just gonna wait

348
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,549
This was I don't even with pong

349
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,809
ping pong pong pong

350
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
Worst two out of three. All right, let's go

351
00:21:51,319 --> 00:22:03,180
What we got coming up next is 223 for five minutes. Just get rid of the timer

352
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:10,329
That was not three minutes. Yeah, it was 19 20 21 22. All right, 223 for five minutes

353
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,980
Don't get rid of the timer. I'm just gonna leave it for now. There's like 600 games

354
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:25,769
I figured we'd do something interesting for the first like hour or two. All right, 223 is

355
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,809
Spy versus I want to play spy versus spy right now

356
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:36,940
223 is called five days. I'll have five minutes to do five days

357
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,599
So we're at i'm looking at the stream time right now. We're at 23 minutes and just about 30 seconds

358
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,589
So five minutes from right now five days

359
00:22:51,099 --> 00:23:05,420
Okay, five nights at freddy's. All right. Do I okay? I'm just shooting. I can't really aim at them

360
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,130
I feel like this is how I end up playing x-com

361
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,230
Oh my fucking god. Okay

362
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,420
I can't shoot them at an angle. I have to do this for five full days

363
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,579
How come I just turned them green?

364
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I can't even aim that direction

365
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,880
I can only aim aim at specific angles

366
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,460
I'm not doing that bad

367
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,019
Drive me fucking crazy

368
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:06,410
I feel like i'm playing like an old nintendo scary horror game like maniac mansion

369
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,849
And the title screen glitched out and it's just repeating

370
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:20,680
The cd just is skipping

371
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,079
Oh, wait, this guy's uh red

372
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,390
orange

373
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,990
He was one hit

374
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,430
Is he just faster?

375
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:37,509
This is penis music

376
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:43,700
No

377
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,299
All right

378
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:47,940
I'm gonna do i'm done. This is stupid

379
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,059
Just stop. Yeah, i'm down with this one. I don't even care. I don't care. I can't take this one anymore. I don't care

380
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:05,160
Now where we going next?

381
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,680
The tire no the time. Yeah, fuck the tire the tires. I don't care

382
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,079
Broke the rules already. I don't care like fuck the timer if it sucks. I don't want to burn my brain

383
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,059
seven minutes

384
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:21,079
All right

385
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:23,079
397 is what is it?

386
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,700
You have to follow the rules 397

387
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,019
Dr mario, this is a classic. This actually might just be dr mario, by the way

388
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:42,299
So do not be surprised if it's just just they just ripped it and put it on here. They did I think

389
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,980
virus level

390
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
speed music type

391
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,009
um, okay

392
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,009
I have a confession to make for all of you watching

393
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,609
I have no idea how to play dr mario. I don't even I don't understand it. I don't get it at all

394
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,849
I don't i've never played it more than five seconds at a time

395
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:08,440
I have to match like the colors right somehow

396
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:14,940
And you get rid of the aliens. I think that's how you play

397
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,349
And then I can attach it to here and then kill right?

398
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,750
Is this the game? This is actually dr mario or is it like a weird bootleg version of it?

399
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,869
Um, oops, there you go. That's fucking best gamer moment. Fuck 2020 moment right there if I ever see one

400
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:47,829
I have to attach this to oops. Oh, I fucked it up. It's over. What am I? Oh my god

401
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:55,190
I can't I hate these kind of games. I can't I do not like tetris style games

402
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:59,420
I can't do them. I get so impatient because the thing goes so slow

403
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,180
It just trickles down like one two three, but i'm like hurry get the fuck down there

404
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:16,150
I have to like think on the fly. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't want to do that. Oh fuck. I'm in trouble

405
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:22,019
No, I can't I can't do it gotta go fast. There's no car I can drive. I don't like it

406
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:27,109
I don't like it. There's no car to drive. I don't like it. I'm so impatient. I'm so fucked up

407
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,059
I can't do it. I'm too fucked up to play these games. I can't do it

408
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:42,119
I can't do it. I'm too fucked. This is why I got like an f in geometry and shit like every year

409
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:49,750
I can't play these games, but I can sing though. Okay, that's worth something

410
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,390
Fuck i'm so screwed

411
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,589
Imagine being in like

412
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:06,789
Junior high school or high school or something and you get your your test back from the teacher and they're like, oh, uh, jeremy

413
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,349
Yeah, you didn't like you messed this all up. You didn't like do this correctly. The the angles are all wrong

414
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:17,029
Um, maybe could you come after class? Maybe like we could do some tutoring. Excuse me teacher. I can sing though

415
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:30,940
That's how you get to the office. Oh, I can sing though. Okay teachers like I don't care cool. That's like great

416
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:38,839
I'll get it this time. What a horrible excuse for every scenario

417
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:46,569
Mr. Albertson just want to let you know your blood pressure is a little high and your cholesterol is a little high too

418
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,849
Hey doc, I can sing though. Okay

419
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,130
uh

420
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,099
Good good

421
00:28:53,099 --> 00:29:03,589
Start eating Cheerios and stop ordering fucking hamburgers from uber eats every day. I've made no progress. What's happening?

422
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,109
But I don't understand like what you're supposed to do in dr

423
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:18,950
Mario I get the concept but like I don't I don't care like, you know when you just don't care

424
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:22,710
And that's why you can't do it because I just don't care. You know what I mean?

425
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,579
How many you guys like do you like you staticians and should have looked at this going like oh man

426
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,339
You see this like wait, you gotta put them right over there

427
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,339
You could have been over there the blue could have gone over that way

428
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,319
I don't care. I can sing

429
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:44,490
I'm done

430
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:58,859
80 uh 88 what's 88? Uh bomber man. Okay, so it's bomber man for a maximum amount of

431
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,950
Two. All right. No, fuck the timer. I don't care. I was playing until I don't care anymore bomber man

432
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:12,730
Is it actual bomber man? Let's see

433
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,509
um

434
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:20,900
Kind of I want to say kind of

435
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,609
Is this what the original one looks like?

436
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,779
It's dead

437
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:44,250
This is what the original game looks like. Is it I don't think i've ever played the original

438
00:30:47,849 --> 00:31:02,390
This is actually literally just bomber man. Is it? Oh, holy shit. Cool. This one's fun. I like bomber man

439
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,950
You know, I used to play bomber man 64

440
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,630
And bomber man 64 had a very surprisingly fun party game mode where you could have like four people

441
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,660
It was like a battle system. It was awesome

442
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:39,579
Come on go get him. I just didn't kill myself today. Okay good. Oh, why are you avoiding me so well?

443
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,990
There it is. Got him. Oh my god

444
00:31:46,069 --> 00:31:48,500
This guy sucks at bomber man

445
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,160
It doesn't care

446
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,119
Does that really matter? Okay in in the year 2020

447
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,150
Does it matter if I can't do the original bomber man very well? I'm gonna die get out what?

448
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:13,619
It's funny. Whatever. It's been two days

449
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,960
You have a certain amount of time to be able to say it's still 2020. Yeah, you get that you get some leeway there

450
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:38,500
It's been two days three thirty six. What's three thirty six? It's been three days. Yeah, but whatever it's three days

451
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,740
So people are oh, yeah, man still saying 2020 shit people still do that shit in march

452
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:43,460
Okay

453
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:50,329
How many times people when they sign in somewhere or they write something and they have to look up to the clerk or right?

454
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,410
I look up to the cashier and go, uh

455
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,720
I don't have any idea what today is or what day it is what time it is and the person has to go

456
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:04,619
Oh, it's um, yeah, it's one four twenty twenty one guys every single time

457
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:07,420
I filled out a piece of paper where there was a clerk in front of me

458
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,059
They had to tell me what the date was every single time

459
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:17,019
I never know what day it is and sometimes they have to tell me twice because they'll say that. Oh, yeah. Yeah

460
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:23,180
Yeah, yeah, four five twenty twenty. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Cool. Thank you and I fill out the paper and then I have to go

461
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,460
four

462
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,059
Five five twenty twenty. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, yeah, that's I thought

463
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:44,490
So, come on this is battleship. Oh, is this actually this is the real battleship where you have to like

464
00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:46,890
guess where uh

465
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,890
People's boats are and stuff

466
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,140
I told you this already

467
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,140
You know, I talked about like the next twitch thing

468
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,420
Let me call it for you. I'm calling it for you right now. We had like

469
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,259
It was all kinds of different trends on twitch right over the last few years

470
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,160
among us

471
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Chess was huge for a while

472
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,639
Rust is getting big right now. The next one's gonna be battleship. It's gonna be fucking battleship

473
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,900
It will be huge drama around battleship

474
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,179
Within the next six months. I guarantee it

475
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:23,079
100 guarantee it

476
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:28,500
You come to me you come to me when i'm correct. I don't care. It doesn't matter how long it is

477
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:32,010
It could be six months

478
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:35,210
Hey, you want the absolute best tip for battleship put every single boat

479
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,929
Right next to each other in the exact same corner

480
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:53,030
Your friends will sit all over that top left part of the map and be like I have no fucking idea where this dude is

481
00:34:53,590 --> 00:35:01,559
Here we go. All right, where are they? That's right here. Oh you've sunk you did I miss

482
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:08,780
Wait, what are we gonna? You're not gonna find shit. Oh, I don't know where it is over here, dude. Nope wrong

483
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,940
Don't get it wrong every time

484
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:14,230
How about right here?

485
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,230
Oh bear just missed

486
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,139
You're never gonna find it

487
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:28,889
Okay, what about what if he's doing the same thing?

488
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,340
Did I get it?

489
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,539
Is that a hit?

490
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:37,719
No

491
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:42,519
Either this strategy or all four corners is the best strategy because people just don't think you're ever gonna do that

492
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:51,420
Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? Whoa? What was that?

493
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:54,139
What is this?

494
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:58,980
How does he have a four shot?

495
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
Um, excuse me. That's not fair

496
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,440
And where's mine that shoots four times?

497
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:12,539
That's fucking ridiculous

498
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:20,420
Why did he get that?

499
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
That's absolutely unfair

500
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,690
That was a hit. Okay, that's a hit. I know where he is

501
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:30,579
Yeah, good luck finding the rest of them

502
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,980
Right now he's oh right. He can do basic math

503
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:40,780
Found yeah, but that's so unfair. You found me because you had the four shooter. That's unbelievable

504
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,260
He's doing the same thing

505
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,949
This would have taken him at least four or five more turns

506
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:56,099
All right, that's one destroyer. I sunk the destroyer

507
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:01,619
All right, so i'm technically in the lead

508
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,780
I hope he's doing the exact same strat. Ah damn it

509
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,309
Pre-recorded what what are you talking about?

510
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,730
Um, i'm gonna say right here. Oh shit

511
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,440
Is it gonna be close?

512
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,840
No, but the computer has a bunch of algorithms inside of its head

513
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,480
It can do that math

514
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,119
A human does not a human has no idea what's going on

515
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,679
And then by the time they figure it out

516
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,530
They look up at you from across the table. They're like dude. No, you did not do that

517
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,250
No, you didn't

518
00:37:55,329 --> 00:37:57,329
And I said like

519
00:37:57,889 --> 00:37:59,650
You didn't know I did

520
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,650
Dude, no, you didn't

521
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:12,500
This computer knows where these are because it's gotta it's literally doing a math problem right now to know what these are

522
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,309
Music's a banger. Yes, it's pretty good

523
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Okay, but he technically doesn't know where the other one is

524
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:34,469
Right here

525
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:38,039
Nope, he does. No, but he can't he doesn't know

526
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:42,920
He's still gonna take him. Uh

527
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,199
It's over. I lose

528
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,949
but wait, no, no, that was the the

529
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,280
Can we stop talking about how bad I am at battleship and start talking about how?

530
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:58,800
Unbelievable it is that you got to shoot four times in one turn

531
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:10,739
Um, I come we're not talking about that and change your weapon

532
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,650
how

533
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:29,000
press select

534
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,989
Oh my god, what? Why?

535
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,940
Mine's even better

536
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:48,869
I missed all of them. But whatever it doesn't matter because you know where to come. You know who to talk to

537
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,539
When all the top streamers are going back and forth in a huge drama on battleship

538
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:11,460
You missed all it doesn't whatever who cares next he lost in 20 turns

539
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,420
Yeah, but doesn't matter

540
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,880
Oh, I pressed. It's number 10

541
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,519
Sorry, I pressed it before you can see it. 10 is robocop 4. We're gonna skip robocop 1 2 and 3

542
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,239
Which okay, that's fine

543
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,559
robocopa 4

544
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:36,130
in 1992

545
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:43,650
1992 presents the year a production of some sort. This was made somehow

546
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:51,320
Robocop with a baby or a child. What why does the child have a machine gun?

547
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,480
What the fuck?

548
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,760
Okay

549
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,369
uh

550
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:06,369
Let's play how come I can't

551
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:09,880
I can't press any buttons

552
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,000
On the shoulder. Yeah, what the hell is going? I can't press anything

553
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:19,110
No buttons do anything. We just get to see the high scores of robocop 4. Okay, there we go

554
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:21,030
start

555
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,329

Things are gonna go on behind closed doors. What?

559
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:48,559
Why was I like leaning back his robocop? He was just like leaning back in the car

560
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,230
He's just like

561
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,550
Okay, so do I how do I select weapons?

562
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,929

Some of you guys are so into this i'm not at all and I mean really at all

648
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:46,750
I never was even when I was younger this game came out when I was a kid

649
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:50,670
This is a big deal when this came out. I remember

650
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,469
Everyone was obsessed with it. Not me

651
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:57,219
I don't care at all about this

652
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,789
It's classic. I have to respect it right because I mean, come on. It's a classic

653
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,849
That's like what you can't but you're gonna hate donkey kong. How?

00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:22,659
Give me the one the l that goes that way. Is that the one is it the l gonna go that way?

Shit, come on, dude. Really?

01:07:40,219 --> 01:07:42,460
Why doesn't have a mind?

843
01:07:50,219 --> 01:07:53,590
Forklift, yeah, but there's nobody in it

844
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:57,619
What bullshit?

845
01:07:57,619 --> 01:07:59,619
Why am I going so holy shit i'm going so slow

846
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,230
Give me a fucking break. All right, just damage boost through it. Oh, all right. We're good

847
01:08:06,869 --> 01:08:08,869
Yeah, I knew you were gonna spawn a guy right in front of me

848
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:14,679
Yeah, I was pretty good at contra when I was younger

849
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:20,300
Hey, what's the best contra times up? It's contra three for super nintendo. You got it wrong. Sorry

850
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:26,409
what

851
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:34,819
excuse me

852
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,819
Okay, it even has the

853
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:39,060
regular nintendo slow down

854
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:45,109
I gotta get more. Okay. There we go. That's better

855
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:58,859
Can I land on that? Can I step on it?

856
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:04,779
Go on I want to see what contra five is like. Let's see if it's any different

857
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,199
There is no five. There's one two three six seven eight

858
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,189
Oh, let's do contra three

859
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:18,890
This is the best contra so let's see this one takes place in neo city 2100 neo city's been around for a long time

860
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,489
That was 1992

861
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,489
It was the first neo city wait

862
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:26,569
Hey, it's me fox. Is that you burns? Wait the hell

863
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:29,430
Yeah

864
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,430
The head of intelligence

865
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,510
Is in serious trouble

866
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:37,989
We need your help. Wait, this is like 200 years in the future

867
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,750
Well, what?

868
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,710
Okay, i'll be in the old warehouse at the edge of the harbor

869
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,380
They must always be a fox and it must always be a burns

870
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:50,489
fox

871
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:56,060
No, we must

872
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:01,750
That's just my face

873
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:13,399
Who am I iron it's the same exact game with just different people

874
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
It's the same game. There's no difference at all

875
01:10:16,819 --> 01:10:22,340
Okay, I want to look at all the contras. I want to see all the copyright characters. They put in

876
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:26,659
Dude, don't be surprised if like fucking mario is on one of these

877
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,579
I really wouldn't be surprised

878
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:34,060
I don't know if like ross from friends was on here, too

879
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,510
Cookie monster might even be on here

880
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:50,840
It could be anybody

881
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,199
Okay, i've already I don't care. I just want to know who the other characters are. I want to see the cutscene

882
01:10:54,199 --> 01:11:01,720
Let's go to contra one. We've seen three and we've seen six. Let's see what contra one is

883
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,850
uh

884
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:08,979
Wait, what?

885
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:12,260
So inside of the contra one folder was like contra two through eight

886
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:21,029
This is just how a ton of folders on my desktop are right now. It's just poor folder management. Uh,

887
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,979
Okay, we're gonna do contra two

888
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:32,890
Contra one folder into subdirectory contra two and now this is just contra

889
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,199
a 100 rip

890
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:40,680
Uh completely I would say absolutely fucking against the law completely illegal. This is contra one

891
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:45,619
Um, okay, whatever

892
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:52,039
I I guess that's what this is contra one. No, it's not wait. Why do I have a spreader automatically?

893
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,979
This is like level three in contra one

894
01:11:57,859 --> 01:11:59,859
But I have upgraded weapons

895
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:08,619
That is

896
01:12:08,619 --> 01:12:09,819
Oh, okay

897
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:18,199
And they made it really simple. They gave you the spreader

898
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:24,300
Why would you do this?

899
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:27,960
It's just different scenes from contra one

900
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:34,439
So am I correct when I think that when they say contra two they mean level two in contra one

901
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,699
We need to investigate a little further here

902
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:54,760
This is gonna take some full investigation. He's so smart. Hey, thanks, man

903
01:12:58,819 --> 01:13:01,060
You know what that boss used to scare the shit out of me in contra

904
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:06,279
It was the boss in I believe it was this exact same kind of style

905
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:09,260
Super contra, right?

906
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,260
Like that weird skeleton guy

907
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:16,779
That hangs around the room when he jumps on he hangs from the ceiling and shit and then his face pops out of the middle

908
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:23,859
And super contra was terrifying. It made every time you fought a boss. It played this horrible scary music

909
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:30,199
It was like

910
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,760
It was like fuck the boss is kind of scary

911
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:52,170
Kill it off. I forgot how fun these games were

912
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,090
You know the sad part about this

913
01:13:56,170 --> 01:14:00,010
I'm gonna say something right now and you guys can tell me. Oh, no. No. Yeah, that's right, dude. That happened already

914
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,970
um, is it too bad that

915
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:08,649
I would love a new contra but the one definitely came out that was an ipad pay to win game probably right?

916
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:15,689
I'm sure they redid contra for ios and it's probably just complete just dog shit pay to win like weird shitty game or something, right?

917
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:26,100
That's so sad, I feel like that would be the thing. All right stage three waterfall. I have 26 lives

918
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:32,380
26 lives

919
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,380
was this in

920
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:39,180
I don't remember any of this

921
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,180
I don't I don't remember this being the game

922
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:44,409
Did I ever never get this far as a kid?

923
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:57,270
All right, I want to investigate contra one. Okay, so that was contra two. Here's contra three

924
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,579
It's definitely just the level select

925
01:15:03,739 --> 01:15:07,739
Yeah, it's the level select. Yeah, of course it is. Oh my fucking god. So what's the other ones then?

926
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:13,609
So if that's that so what is contra 30p?

927
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,600
Shotgun what's shotgun?

928
01:15:20,619 --> 01:15:33,420
This is just letting you start with the shotgun. That's so dumb

929
01:15:34,539 --> 01:15:37,500
Okay

930
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:42,220
It's just just a game shark. Okay. No, no, no, I don't want to do contra. No stop doing contras

931
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,600
12 in one

932
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,039
so bogus

933
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:50,039
Click the link. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What's this link?

934
01:15:50,840 --> 01:16:02,520
I'm gonna click the link. Okay, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Not bad. It's not bad. It's pretty good

935
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:13,420
Uh, by the way, that is eight oh five eight. Oh six see I can read that today

936
01:16:21,609 --> 01:16:39,689
Uh, how come it's not showing up there it is. All right, let's go. I want to see what contra two is

937
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:51,159
This is a debug menu

938
01:16:51,159 --> 01:17:02,149
All right contra 30s contra four a this is not what that's not contra super

939
01:17:02,149 --> 01:17:13,500
What arena four play is this contra it is

940
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:22,520
So this is just contra two

941
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:27,159
The contra three is not contra three. It's a made-up contra three

942
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,789
So what would contra six or seven be? Um, I've no I don't know what's going on

943
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:44,710
Not bad

944
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:52,220
But all right. I I don't I need to see so if that's contra two con we've seen contra six

945
01:17:52,869 --> 01:18:07,180
What is contra seven super contra seven? I hope fox I hope burns is in trouble

946
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:12,630
Oh, this is uh, definitely a made-up one

947
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:18,300
uh

948
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,140
You can tell because how badly this one runs and I can't even pick this item up

949
01:18:22,699 --> 01:18:26,600
It's just a rom hack of the first one

950
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:31,590
All the enemy spawning is just so wrong and off

951
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,739
two room

952
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:39,340
Two room sail

953
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,340
Look at this enemy spawning

954
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,399
Oh

955
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:46,680
Oh

956
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,039
Tototel

957
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:50,039
otototel

958
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,380
Sail sail sail

959
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:07,260
Everything's on sale. The whole world is on sale

960
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,720
The otto hotel. Oh, it's otto hotel

961
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:16,090
Love you. Love you. Love you. Love you

962
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:26,020
I think two room is my favorite

963
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:31,979
Although otto totel is probably is good. This is impossible to play by the way. This is impossible

964
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,779
And if you noticed we have not made any progress

965
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:37,739
We keep doing the exact same screens

966
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,939
This is never ending just keep walking to the right same thing

967
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:55,060
Okay, what's contra eight? Here we go

968
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:03,460
It's somehow just worse font version of the last one. In fact, it's pasted over

969
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:14,739
It's superimposed over the last one. It's just pasted on

970
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:18,489
Okay, let's see same exact game. No difference at all

971
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,520
And what's with this music?

972
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:33,560
I feel like I only have like 100 seconds left in any old nintendo game

973
01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:38,789
Oh hurry up

974
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:54,899
Yeah, if you slowed this down it might actually be like a good nintendo like regular nintendo song

975
01:20:55,779 --> 01:21:01,369
Done i'm done with this. It's over. Oh, that was super crunch at eight

976
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:08,939
All right. Now, where are we going? I mean, let's I mean let's do the robocop like fuck it. Whatever

977
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,899
We saw robocop four. Let's do robocop one

978
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:17,020
License from ocean software and then a real company the future of law enforcement

979
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,220
nice

980
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:23,899
Load up that gun

981
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:26,739
same exact thing

982
01:21:26,739 --> 01:21:28,739
arrest mode second street

983
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:37,500
Nash avenue crime in progress. Oh, it's it's different. It's a different game

984
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:42,970
Okay, there's a punch. I just have a punch. I don't have anything else

985
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,930
Select doesn't do anything

986
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:48,260
Okay

987
01:21:48,260 --> 01:22:00,579
These are these are who are these people? Okay. That's not fair. I don't have nothing. I know button select this block

988
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:05,109
Start doesn't do anything

989
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,189
All the buttons don't do it

990
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:14,479
That person just drop kicked out of the fucking window and hit me that was incredibly impressive that was unbelievable

991
01:22:17,979 --> 01:22:19,979
Oh, yeah, I didn't even hit him he missed and he died

992
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:34,329
I want to go up. It's castlevania. Oh my god

993
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,989
Off the top rope. I can't go down

994
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:45,260
I don't understand how I still have a gun that I can't use

995
01:22:46,949 --> 01:22:47,909
Oh

996
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:51,350
He decided to take out the gun. It's a scripted. Wait, what?

997
01:22:52,149 --> 01:23:06,119
I don't want to I just shot a dog. I don't want to I don't like hate that sound. I don't like that

998
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:08,199
I don't want to hear that. I don't like that

999
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,159
Why there's so many fucking rabid dogs?

1000
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:24,810
Why am I aiming like this too?

1001
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,170
Okay

1002
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:27,930
Here's what's going on right now

1003
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:31,850
Uh this game they had some kind of model. This is pulling back a bow and arrow

1004
01:23:32,489 --> 01:23:34,020
And they just didn't care to change it

1005
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,460
This is a different model for some other game that they made probably and it's pulling back a bow and arrow

1006
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:42,779
What on earth is that doctor robotnik? Okay?

1007
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:57,750

Data east got him in the air. All right, I made it through. Oh shit

1009
01:24:05,989 --> 01:24:07,989
He's blocking the bullets with his hand

1010
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:18,140
Come on, okay

1011
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:55,210
Hey

1012
01:24:55,289 --> 01:25:00,890
Why would you shoot a flamethrower out your window down, you know, the flames would come back up and hit you right in the fucking face

1013
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,289
Aiming a flamethrower down wouldn't the flames just come back up and hit you

1014
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:19,449
Wouldn't the heat like come back when like the flames check back up backwards and like hit you in the face

1015
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:31,430
That's not how fire works. What some of those flames would come back and hit you in the face

1016
01:25:37,829 --> 01:25:41,880
Can I go in?

1017
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,880
Oh, all right. I gotta put the put the gun away

1018
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:46,039
Now it's just fighting

1019
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:51,159
There's liquid in there

1020
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:52,840
It's simply hot

1021
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,279
And plus wouldn't you burn the like building down too if you got like right?

1022
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,930
I'm just going this is not somebody's room, right?

1023
01:26:02,409 --> 01:26:04,010
Why is there a gun on the ground?

1024
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,399
Thought equals up. Yeah heat rises

1025
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:16,199

01:26:27,609 --> 01:26:30,010
I had to open up my iced coffee to do that and I got it all over my face

1030
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:34,250
It's like a cover. It's all over my mouth and my chin and my nose and stuff

1031
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:44,390
Remember, you're so stupid ban that guy for life ban that guy for life. Don't ever want to see that guy's name again

1032

1033
01:26:56,569 --> 01:26:58,760
Who I don't know

1034
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,579

1047
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:09,880
Uh, I can't I can't do anything in here. Oh shit. Wait, this is like the this is the boss

1048
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:24,439

I love when people at at okay

1050
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,510
Robocop has never discouraged. Let's challenge again. No, let's see. The next one is

1051
01:28:32,069 --> 01:28:34,869
Every time I say a fake person's name you guys at the fake person

1052
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:46,069
Until somebody makes the fake person's name remember you made my little sister cry when you made the pig noise that time

1053
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:53,880
What do you mean?

1054
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,039
What was your little sister watching me?

1055
01:28:57,289 --> 01:29:01,579
Yeah, don't that's not a good idea. All right, that was Robocop one. Let's see Robocop two

1056
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,100
1981 is that 1881?

1057
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:13,449
That's 1881

1058
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:16,250
Got quite a few bullets in that uh handgun Robocop

1059
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:22,489
Only supposed to be I believe 12 rounds in there

1060
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:27,270
Gatling gun

1061
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,710
All right, let's go

1062
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:33,590
dark

1063
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:35,800
What why is he wolverine?

1064
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,560
A nuke laboratory has been located destroy all nukes on the premises

1065
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:46,199
What target villains to be arrested are indicated by a flashing icon a select nuke a store is reported in this area

1066
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:48,199
Why would I blow up the nukes in the nuke lab?

1067
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:56,279
I don't know who that was but they've walked out here and I just shot them. I don't know who that was

1068
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:58,359
I have no idea who you were

1069
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,229
This moment i'm on ice

1070
01:30:02,869 --> 01:30:04,869
Why is there ice momentum in this?

1071
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:08,869
This is fucking horrible

1072
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:17,779
Why is it like

1073
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,779
It's just skiing around

1074
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:25,699
This is a huge dog fire hydrant, too

1075
01:30:28,869 --> 01:30:34,310
How do I arrest people wait shouldn't I be arresting these people instead? There's an arrest icon over there for the flashing indicator

1076
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:39,020
So how do I arrest them?

1077
01:30:48,699 --> 01:30:51,659
Do I have an arrest button or something to select arrest?

1078
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,100
So I have to destroy the nukes here

1079
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:04,140
If you don't get enough momentum, by the way, you're not going to make these jumps. So I need to

1080
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:20,470
Am I knocking on the door now?

1081
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:25,350
I'm deciding to knock on this door

1082
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:31,260
You have 22 of the nuke you've destroyed 22 you have arrested 40 of the target villains what

1083
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:41,210
Report you have not destroyed enough nuke in your last mission proceed to the firing range for testing and calibration

1084
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:47,979
There weren't any nukes and what do you mean arrested? I killed everyone

1085
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,970
uh

1086
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:55,369
This is just another game for the nintendo

1087
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:59,739
By the way, what are you doing up there?

1088
01:32:01,979 --> 01:32:03,819
This is what's this game called?

1089
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:11,289
for time

1090
01:32:11,289 --> 01:32:19,060
How many people have to kill?

1091
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:23,029
This is actually in the robocop game

1092
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:32,119
oops

1093
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:36,300
Oops, this I this hurts to do

1094
01:32:39,829 --> 01:32:44,310
38 how many people do I have to kill 37? I have to kill. Oh my god. I killed so many more people

1095
01:32:45,430 --> 01:32:48,250
All right, does it matter if I miss and hit somebody?

1096
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:56,550
How much more time do I have not very much

1097
01:32:57,109 --> 01:33:01,960
There's so many just random civilians here

1098
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,300
There's more civilians than the bad guys

1099
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,979
Come on

1100
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,159

report

1103
01:33:42,739 --> 01:33:47,140
You failed to attain enough points in the firing range. You must return to your previous assignment

1104
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:04,390
I don't think so

1105
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:10,920
All right, we saw robocop, uh four right? So we need to see robocop three super rescue

1106
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:26,760
This is in a different language robocop

1107
01:34:30,710 --> 01:34:37,560
That's not robocop. Oh dear

1108
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,659
Okay

1109
01:34:42,659 --> 01:34:46,649
stamina

1110
01:34:46,649 --> 01:34:49,210
I took it's a three like a four hit combo

1111
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,600
Okay

1112
01:34:54,600 --> 01:35:01,939
This is kind of fun, but not really at all, but i'm gonna give it two minutes

1113
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:05,300
I'll give this the one minute it deserves. You know what I mean?

1114
01:35:05,939 --> 01:35:12,789
It's a p station. It is right

1115
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:26,340
What happens if I spell the word robocop three

1116
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:32,470
Too many robocops

1117
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:34,470
Uh, let go let go of the grave

1118
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,760
like flappy bird

1119
01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:48,380
Pete get it

1120
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,779
Robocop four is three. This is shatter hand

1121
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:55,659
Wait, this is a different this is a different is a game

1122
01:35:56,539 --> 01:36:03,449
What the fuck is that?

1123
01:36:03,449 --> 01:36:11,689
All right, this is awesome. Yeah, this is a game. Oh, I'm so just ripped off. Okay

1124
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,060
Okay

1125
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:18,939
They must have just seen the cyborg and just said you know what I don't just put it as robocop three

1126
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:28,199
This is good

1127
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:31,369
It actually is pretty fun

1128
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:38,020
Shatter hand is an actually good game

1129
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:45,180
Kind of feels that way

1130
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,710
All right

1131
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:49,020
Play ace combat

1132
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:51,020
Will you stop with the ace combat?

1133
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,500
I'm not gonna play ace combat

1134
01:36:54,329 --> 01:36:56,329
Lost time. All right, let's go

1135
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:06,090
Shit, okay, he swings the gun at you when he gets when you get close

1136
01:37:11,050 --> 01:37:12,569
Can't shoot him with anything

1137
01:37:12,569 --> 01:37:22,329
That hurt what was that hitbox you serious?

1138
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,689
Actually good game. Yeah, dude

1139
01:37:44,329 --> 01:37:52,659
That's fun. All right. We did the whole first page

1140
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:59,289
So anything one through ten is done. Let's get a random one. Why not? Let's go random again

1141
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:07,029
and 482

1142
01:38:07,189 --> 01:38:17,029
shockwave shockwave by american game cartridges

1143
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:24,359
I would probably put at least a hundred dollars on the fact that this was not made by an american game cartridge company

1144
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:31,640
I think that would be a safe bet

1145
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:35,130
But you know

1146
01:38:35,130 --> 01:38:41,140
Do your name? Um

1147
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:48,789
X who cares doesn't matter shockwave man left men left five code hti level one minor work

1148
01:38:56,869 --> 01:38:58,520
But I don't

1149
01:38:58,520 --> 01:38:59,960
Oh cool

1150
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:07,779
That's cool

1151
01:39:07,779 --> 01:39:09,779
Can I dig through these?

1152
01:39:09,779 --> 01:39:12,020
Nice, this is awesome. All right. I like this one

1153
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:16,520
Do I have a certain amount of ammo?

1154
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:21,420
Oh, this reminds me of

1155
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:29,779
Shubabrab

1156
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:34,579
Yeah, the music is absolute dogshit you're right

1157
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:39,189
This one's not bad though. Oh, wait a minute. This has got weird

1158
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:43,850
um

1159
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:45,369
Oh, no, I don't

1160
01:39:45,369 --> 01:39:48,039
This has got it complicated. I don't I does it

1161
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:53,100
because it moves it

1162
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,619
up or down or

1163
01:39:54,619 --> 01:40:17,699
405 405 is

1164
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:30,810
Seaport guarl seaport guarl seaport guarl. What is guarl?

1165
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:33,130
guarl

1166
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:36,680
That's not supposed to be war right seaport war

1167
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:47,829
Seaport guarl guarl. This one looks like it could be kind of fun support guard. That makes sense

1168
01:40:52,180 --> 01:40:54,180
Oh this sucks

1169
01:40:55,619 --> 01:40:57,619
This is awful

1170
01:40:57,939 --> 01:41:02,420
Space invaders, but way slower way more clunky and not fun at all

1171
01:41:19,739 --> 01:41:27,739
It's so bad, I can't even tolerate that for more than one second 5 26. I can't even tolerate it

1172
01:41:28,699 --> 01:41:43,000

No wrong button

1214

There's a dodge. I think there's iframes on that I could be wrong, but I think there is

1215
01:45:32,979 --> 01:45:36,819
I have to bomb the target and hopefully I get there good at a fast enough time. Is it a bomb?

1216
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:39,939
Oh, I do I have the bomb

1217
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:41,579

01:47:12,569 --> 01:47:27,100
It's not it. I like this one. Actually, if it wasn't so bright and horrible on the eyes, I would actually like this

1225
01:47:32,069 --> 01:47:34,069
Oh fuck. I missed the bomb. Whatever

1226
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:43,479
Okay, just dodge

1227
01:47:43,479 --> 01:47:49,239
Fuck. Oh god, you can't it's impossible. It's impossible

1228
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:57,619
baron and max

1229
01:47:57,619 --> 01:47:59,619
Let's go. It's two people

1230
01:48:06,489 --> 01:48:10,489
He didn't make it off the runway didn't even make it off the runway max

1231
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:14,069
Well, I still gotta do the mission man

1232
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:17,100
I I still we have a contract here

1233
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:26,550
Oh my fucking god, what just happened? What i'm still alive

1234
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:31,939

1235
01:48:32,819 --> 01:48:44,260
I did it. Let's go

1236
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:50,180
Good start max. I'm really glad that

1237
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:53,979
I'm really glad you came along

1238
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:06,069
The absolute just double cross

1239
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:17,479
I want to play this another one one more time. I don't get max anymore. He's gone

1240
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:22,710
Oh

1241
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:26,710
Jesus christ, that's impossible. It's too hard. It's a fun one, but that's

1242
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:37,479
You move so slow. All right. What's next 415 go backwards. It'll be faster

1243
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,739
four one five is

1244
01:49:43,050 --> 01:49:49,210
Holy shit, dude. This one is not just warfare. Not just a great war not just constant war the

1245
01:49:50,069 --> 01:49:55,340
utmost warfare there's no other warfare that will be more

1246
01:49:55,899 --> 01:49:59,819
Uh, that'll be higher than this that'll be more dangerous and and this is the size this is the top

1247
01:49:59,819 --> 01:50:03,479
This is high as you can go in war

1248
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:07,720
And they've already got planets and shit. So we're talking planetary level of destruction

1249
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:19,449
I don't know what i'm hitting

1250
01:50:19,449 --> 01:50:25,899
There's so many particles on the screen. I don't know which one is an enemy which is part of the background

1251
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:35,930
Okay, I think I understand

1252
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:40,630
Remember the asterisk

1253
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:44,090
Oh double triple spreader

1254
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:59,939
And you have so much screen real estate that you're only going to use the middle part of the screen and down

1255
01:51:00,899 --> 01:51:05,539
You really had to have that big planet the big marble in the background had to take up the entire third of the screen

1256
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:09,859
Because they weren't spawning in the middle. This would be a lot easier and way more fun

1257
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,979
And I don't know what's coming at us. Something is coming towards us

1258
01:51:13,699 --> 01:51:23,640
I feel like i'm watching

1259
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,680
When somebody uploads an entire television show to youtube

1260
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,039
And they put it in a square in the middle of the screen and they surround it with a bunch of other bullshit

1261
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:36,819
It's like dude, that's like you think it's gonna help

1262
01:51:51,449 --> 01:51:55,130
Oh, there's no never be a war that will be more than this

1263
01:51:55,930 --> 01:52:09,659
I've had enough. What's next?

1264
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:14,779
357

1265
01:52:14,779 --> 01:52:18,710
Boot cat. I got a good feeling about boot cat boot cat

1266
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:23,479
Oh, it's just that's a cat inside of a boot. This couldn't get any more fun

1267
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:28,539
scene one england

1268
01:52:28,539 --> 01:52:30,539
Uh, that's not where england is

1269
01:52:32,489 --> 01:52:34,489
That was uh, that was california

1270
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,130
Is it cat boy boot cat

1271
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:57,449
What's going on with these other cats?

1272
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:01,220
Oh boy

1273
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:05,659
uh

1274
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:07,659
You have to start it just stands still to shoot

1275
01:53:11,579 --> 01:53:15,029
Uh, it's like four seconds left. What?

1276
01:53:15,829 --> 01:53:19,880
Why is the timer counting up instead of down? That's kind of weird, right?

1277
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:22,920
Why is it a 14 seconds?

1278
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:32,470
Uh, this is a real game. What do they make this up?

1279
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:42,199
Is that the time of day? Is that gonna reset at zero? Let's see. Yeah, that's the time of day

1280
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
That's what time it is right now

1281
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:49,960
They decided to add a full cycling block

1282
01:53:54,729 --> 01:53:55,770
Why?

1283
01:53:55,770 --> 01:54:03,819
Honey, I can't shoot

1284
01:54:03,979 --> 01:54:07,020
There's a giant shark under there and i'm can barely concern

1285
01:54:07,659 --> 01:54:09,659
Oh my eyes

1286
01:54:10,579 --> 01:54:12,020
Why?

1287
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:16,739
What is the point? Why would you put this in the game? What are you doing? Why would you do this?

1288
01:54:20,039 --> 01:54:22,039
Oh my god, the sun just exploded

1289
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:32,460
This is a long level one, by the way, it just doesn't stop

1290
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:37,909
We could have done mario

1291
01:54:37,989 --> 01:54:39,899
one one

1292
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:42,199
10 times by now

1293
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:44,199
It never ends dragon

1294
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:56,140
Okay, let's go to the atlantic, uh ocean

1295
01:54:57,739 --> 01:54:59,739
Cool. All right. I'm beating this whole game. Let's go

1296
01:55:02,739 --> 01:55:04,739
It's even doing the mario song

1297
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:08,920
The urine the water level. Oh, I love it boot cat is perfect

1298
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,840
Is that wait that's supposed to be water?

1299
01:55:19,029 --> 01:55:23,590
What wait why is the water go into like a mountain

1300
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:32,409
Get out of here

1301
01:55:32,409 --> 01:55:34,409
What is this? Can I go in this?

1302
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:40,539
How many different paint tools are you going to use?

1303
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,939
You can't just change the thickness of the pen halfway through your ms paint

1304
01:55:45,579 --> 01:55:47,579
Drawing you can't do that

1305
01:55:47,579 --> 01:55:49,579
But what happened to the consistency?

1306
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:52,630
Well, okay

1307
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:59,100
I can't wait to see yeah. Here's another water mountain

1308
01:56:07,579 --> 01:56:09,579
This lightning now coming down from the sky

1309
01:56:09,659 --> 01:56:15,750
I think these are supposed to be waves if oh really

1310
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:35,060
What the fuck is that thing what just stole me something just came and took me it was a rat or a mouse or something. Yeah

1311
01:56:42,619 --> 01:56:48,340
It's the best one so far bootcats the best. It's just

1312
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:51,609
It's I love it. It's so good

1313
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:57,899
Almost got hit by that shit

1314
01:56:57,899 --> 01:57:00,560
I have to do well enough to beat this level because I need to see what's next

1315
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:19,270
All right, watch out here comes the lightning

1316
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:21,350
What the fuck was that? All right, easy easy

1317
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:24,310
Don't get struck. Don't get struck. Don't get struck. Go go go go

1318
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:28,739
Right at the same exact spot too. Come on

1319
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:33,060
All right, last try last try last try last try

1320
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:40,859
We have to go up the water mountain and the lightning is right above you

1321
01:57:49,529 --> 01:57:51,529
No, but I have to jump. I can't just

1322
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:57,500
This thing's not gonna hurt you. What am I concerned about?

1323
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:08,899
All right, don't blow it. Have we figured out what the timer is actually for?

1324
01:58:10,619 --> 01:58:14,140
Or is it just there for some reason what's the 73 in the top?

1325
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:16,300
Wait

1326
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,859
It's not 73 lives. Is it?

1327
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:20,699
What's the p?

1328
01:58:20,699 --> 01:58:23,880
All right, don't go fast because you have the ability to

1329
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,899
There comes the lightning

1330
01:58:27,899 --> 01:58:30,869
Slow down

1331
01:58:30,869 --> 01:58:35,909
They look at the mat movement pattern. They move with the screen faster when you hit right

1332
01:58:42,409 --> 01:58:50,840
Oh my god

1333
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:55,479
Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. I can't show that

1334
01:58:56,119 --> 01:59:03,930
I can't fucking show that. Um, I can't do that. No, I ain't gonna show this

1335
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:05,930
I can't even look at the screen. I'm trying as hard as I can to get to the end

1336
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:12,260
Oh my god, this is so this is impossible

1337
01:59:12,739 --> 01:59:15,369
You have no idea how hard this is

1363
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:41,420
Sure

1364
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:43,579
There's a lot of menu options. Where are we?

1365
02:01:45,399 --> 02:01:47,399
Uh, all right. It's my turn

1366
02:01:50,439 --> 02:01:52,600

Is that uh, for a second? I thought that was spelling i c u p at the bottom

1368
02:01:59,689 --> 02:02:05,529
I thought it was like our spell i c u p i cup. What did I that's what I thought that was

1369
02:02:16,010 --> 02:02:30,260
Where's the net? Isn't there usually a net? This isn't it's actually really not that bad. It's like cute but

1370
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:36,380
Functionality wise it's kind of at a zero. Nice jumping hit. Okay. All right. There's a good volley

1371
02:02:38,779 --> 02:02:42,739
Oh

1372
02:02:42,739 --> 02:02:44,739
It's a baby game. There are no nets

1373
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:02,539
This is actually a hello kitty game. I'm sure it is

1374
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:16,569
One come on

1375
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:22,710
Nope that hit me in the face fucking left. I

1376
02:03:27,979 --> 02:03:29,979
He's gonna wait. Why is there another player?

1377
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:33,430
And it was allowed to bounce on his side

1378
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:36,149
It was allowed to bounce on his side

1379
02:03:36,930 --> 02:03:39,319
Excuse me

1380
02:03:39,319 --> 02:03:41,720
Where's my point? Do I not get points for this?

1381
02:03:42,359 --> 02:03:58,359
Come on land and I still land twice on his side. That's unfair

1382
02:03:59,159 --> 02:04:03,979

It's tetris and that pipe shit. What an awful idea

1392
02:05:23,939 --> 02:05:36,550
It's a bad idea

1393
02:05:36,550 --> 02:05:41,430
Uh, I need to go. Oh my god. I lost wait. There's another

1394

I don't like this

1395
02:05:48,939 --> 02:05:53,909
You guys know how much I hate this game. This game has haunted me since I was

1396
02:05:56,680 --> 02:06:01,720
This is actually a pretty cool idea if you think about it, but I can't do it. It's too much for me. I can't do it

1397
02:06:02,439 --> 02:06:22,220

1406
02:07:24,119 --> 02:07:33,319
I have to do this in one shot with two shots

1407
02:07:34,039 --> 02:07:36,859
How's that possible?

1408
02:07:36,859 --> 02:07:47,529
There it is. I don't get to

1409
02:07:47,850 --> 02:08:04,579
Resident sleeper. Yeah, I know you with a love pool or you hate pool. There's no in between

There's not like I oh I kind of like pool

1411
02:08:13,050 --> 02:08:16,329
No, no, no, you either love this and do this a lot or you hate doing this

1412
02:08:16,970 --> 02:08:23,340
And the idea of somebody saying hey, do you want to go like play pool is like god?

1413
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:27,739
Please don't fucking ever ask me. Please. I hope no one ever asks me so I don't have to say yes

1414
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:44,229

1418
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,880
Holy shit, this is unfair

1419
02:09:22,489 --> 02:09:26,329
This is like a 30 year old in like the 12 year old competition. You got to get this guy out of here

1420
02:09:27,029 --> 02:09:34,949
semi-final round

1421
02:09:34,949 --> 02:09:40,550
Final round of the tournament this person's in a suit

1422
02:09:44,119 --> 02:09:46,119
Holy shit, they're strong. Fuck. I lost

1423
02:09:48,949 --> 02:09:52,979
Okay, let's go

1424
02:09:55,449 --> 02:09:56,010
Oh, yeah

1425
02:09:56,010 --> 02:10:02,170
Hey, you want to get fucking original mortal combat strategy to make your friends fucking scream in your face and leave the house

1426
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:11,130
You let you you you you you i'm fucking leaving like i'm not coming back. Wait side scroller

1427
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:26,090
I thought it was just a tournament. How many guys had uh the

1428
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:27,449
Here's all right

1429
02:10:27,449 --> 02:10:32,569
There's a few just a few you know ground rules that are played that are put in place when you play video against your friends, right?

1430
02:10:33,289 --> 02:10:36,489
Anybody ever played a sports game like a baseball with their friends?

1431
02:10:37,130 --> 02:10:38,649
one-on-one

1432
02:10:38,649 --> 02:10:43,770
And you have to make the rule you are only allowed to throw strikes because throwing balls

1433
02:10:44,329 --> 02:10:48,489
Was impossible to read and you would miss every time if they threw it way far away

1434
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:53,899
No leg sweeps in mortal combat or you automatically lose

1435
02:10:59,130 --> 02:11:02,250
Like if you if you do a leg sweep in mortal combat I win the match

1436
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:06,489
If you throw a ball in like some of those old nintendo super nintendo games

1437
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:11,689
That were baseball you automatically lose like because you they're unhittable and you can't even tell that they're coming in as ball

1438
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:17,430
Uh, uh golden eye

1439
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:19,430
Nobody is allowed to play odd job

1440
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:23,350
You gotta put down the video game ground rules

1441
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:33,720
Oh, i'm all of a sudden i'm gonna get trued on that one. Where's that? Why's that lady up in a tree? What?

1442
02:11:34,199 --> 02:11:36,840
I'm gonna get trued on that one. You're gonna true that one

1443
02:11:37,479 --> 02:11:38,920
Not the other one

1444
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:49,399
i'm dead

1445
02:11:49,399 --> 02:11:53,850
Daniel san in okinawa chance. Oh, okay. I got one more life

1446
02:11:54,409 --> 02:11:56,970
This one's actually pretty fun

1447
02:11:56,970 --> 02:11:58,970
This is probably just the actual game

1448
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,590
but

1449
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:02,710
uh

1450
02:12:02,710 --> 02:12:05,979
Did they do the movie backwards?

1451
02:12:05,979 --> 02:12:22,069
Doesn't the tournament happen like in the end of the movie the popular one to not seem like a mortal combat scrub

1452
02:12:25,989 --> 02:12:27,909
um, i'm sorry, but

1453
02:12:27,909 --> 02:12:31,109
The leg sweep in mortal combat like one two and three

1454
02:12:32,300 --> 02:12:43,029
Swing the hammer. All right, if anybody trains like that, that's what wouldn't happen

1455
02:12:43,510 --> 02:12:47,720
I know you like to watch that in movies and tv shows all the extreme training regiment

1456
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:51,079
Well, you have to like dodge like all these things. Look at all. It's a knife. It's gonna kill you

1457
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:54,220
You're dead. You're gonna die

1458
02:12:54,220 --> 02:12:55,979
dodge the pendulum

1459
02:12:55,979 --> 02:13:00,060
I'm gonna like you're gonna go through like the fucking football training thing and smash into stuff

1460
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:02,699
No, just fucking do push-ups and like kick into the mirror

1461
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:16,789
Please relax

1462
02:13:16,789 --> 02:13:20,550
Kick no kick into the mirror not kick the mirror like watch yourself kicking

1463
02:13:20,710 --> 02:13:22,550
To see how good the form is

1464
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:26,010
I need to be level one at least come on

1465
02:13:33,609 --> 02:13:45,060
You broke the mirror. I didn't say to kick the mirror ice block break. Oh, I gotta go to the hospital

1466
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:46,899
I gotta go to the hospital. Oh, why did I do that?

1467
02:13:46,899 --> 02:13:50,020
Why do we do this shit? I could have just fucking done push-ups and kicked in the mirror

1468
02:13:51,539 --> 02:14:02,010
Can I take like six to eight weeks for this to heal?

1469
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:04,859
maybe longer

1470
02:14:04,859 --> 02:14:16,520
This person throwing I like the bonus games are more fun than the actual game. I just want to play those

1471
02:14:18,199 --> 02:14:20,199
Get out of my fucking way, please

1472
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:22,310

02:24:55,620 --> 02:24:58,340
I would pull a splinter out of his foot and we'd become best friends and I would win

1530
02:25:00,010 --> 02:25:05,430
Mouse versus dog mouse is the worst. Why do I have so many mice lion versus? Oh, here we go

This is gonna be big warthog versus elephant elephant fucking wins dog versus lion. This game is stupid

1532
02:25:16,659 --> 02:25:25,860
So you just have to just hit a until but how is somebody gonna win if we can't decide what our deck is?

1533
02:25:27,799 --> 02:25:31,399
Yes, I just said deck but how else would you like me to describe this?

02:25:56,860 --> 02:26:12,420
So the mouse doesn't win so okay, so the mouse is like a two this is gonna come back this way now

1537
02:26:12,500 --> 02:26:16,739
It's never gonna end. I'm invested now

1538
02:26:17,299 --> 02:26:22,260
Uh, I was invested until we saw all the different animals and now it's just

1539
02:26:23,989 --> 02:26:37,100
Unwinnable war because it's gonna go back and forth forever. Somebody said what a truly terrible game

1540
02:26:41,079 --> 02:26:43,399
No, you know why I feel bad for all the people in the audience

1541
02:26:45,450 --> 02:26:55,209
Especially the people in the front row because those tickets were a thousand dollars you guys us. No, I mean in the game

1542
02:27:00,409 --> 02:27:05,290
Yeah, there's no winner. It's not gonna happen. It's just flipping a coin over and over again until you win the 20 times in a row

1543

We'll see you next one, please. That was animal war 331. All right after this one. We're gonna pick some

Cash register cash register a musical note in the background. Cool. All right step

1575
02:31:42,659 --> 02:31:53,879
pretty good we're making a ouija board horsey and

1576
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:56,299
one of those

1577
02:31:56,299 --> 02:31:59,579
Push machines that has the balls in it that pretends to be a lawnmower and it goes

1578
02:32:00,059 --> 02:32:17,909
There's a little thing in the middle pops the balls up. I love those. It's like my favorite toy. Okay, uh,

1579
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:27,340
I don't know what that is bathtub. There it is. This is it's so loud. No, it's not

1580
02:32:27,739 --> 02:32:32,520
Mary had a little lamb and made as I was

1581
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:36,440
I don't know. How do you what is mary had a little lamb what a lyrics

1582
02:32:39,290 --> 02:32:42,010
Mary had it's like three words in the whole song

1583
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:49,479
It's mary had a little lamb mary had a little lamb and the sheep's wool was what?

1584
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:54,100
It's a real lawnmower

1585
02:32:54,100 --> 02:33:05,180
His fur was soft as snow

1586
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:11,260
That's not it whose fur was soft as snow. You got it wrong, too

1587
02:33:12,139 --> 02:33:17,379
That's incorrect

1588
02:33:19,219 --> 02:33:22,899
Little lamb it's probably funny when people sing nursery rhymes like that

1589
02:33:23,860 --> 02:33:25,059
and

1590
02:33:25,059 --> 02:33:28,260
Look when you sing mary had a little lamb or twinkle twinkle little star

1591
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:33,780
It's just so simple and basic in the syllables and the way that you say it is broken up so deliberately like

1592
02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:39,459
Mary had a little lamb little lamb little lamb

1593
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:45,590
But when you have a singer that gets a hold of those it's no longer simple anymore. It's like

1594
02:33:46,229 --> 02:33:48,629
mary had a little lamb

1595
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:54,229
Little lamb little lamb. It's like you just fucking sing the song normally for god's sake

1596
02:33:55,579 --> 02:34:02,379
Mary had a little lamb whose snow was half as large

1597
02:34:11,319 --> 02:34:16,100
I'm getting old

1598
02:34:16,100 --> 02:34:18,979
Okay, i'm done with this one. This one sucks

1599
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:31,850
You're gonna read the time. I am not high right now. Okay, leave me alone. I love you. Just enjoy

1600
02:34:32,409 --> 02:34:33,909
fruit pig

1601
02:34:33,989 --> 02:34:37,399
Milk nuts

1602
02:34:37,399 --> 02:34:39,639
Nuts and milk nut. What does that say?

1603
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:45,899
Get away from me

1604
02:34:45,899 --> 02:34:53,239
I'm dead. We just both died. All right, i'm done with milk nuts. I'm not playing nuts

1605
02:34:55,379 --> 02:35:02,840
What's the fruit pig?

1606
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:07,079
Mary had a little lamb little lamb

1607
02:35:09,559 --> 02:35:22,299
Holy shit, this one looks awesome catch the fruit. I feel like this is part of the end credits of sing

1608
02:35:24,739 --> 02:35:30,340
They would do something like this right like the pig dancing with like retro graphics and stuff. I think that did happen didn't it

1609
02:35:39,590 --> 02:35:43,510
What is the song the song at the end of that song? It's like try

1610
02:35:44,149 --> 02:35:46,149
Hold on try everything

1611
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:49,190
Try everything right? What does it get? What does it go?

1612
02:35:58,659 --> 02:36:02,100
Try everything it's wrong movie about animals. Whatever. It's this

1613
02:36:02,260 --> 02:36:08,020
Sorry, two animal movies came out that were 3d and had animals in three dimensions and they had like fun

1614
02:36:08,020 --> 02:36:10,899
And they like was the lessons that they learned. Okay, sorry. I got it wrong

1615
02:36:18,459 --> 02:36:20,860
How did I lose? I got like what a harvest that was

1616
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:27,639
You're one of the only you're one of seven people that actually watched sing

1617
02:36:30,459 --> 02:36:31,690

1618
02:36:31,690 --> 02:36:34,649
That movie's insanely popular. I have no idea what you're talking about

I need to okay. I need to catch more than 11 of each one. Sure. Let's go

1620
02:36:40,180 --> 02:36:54,059
It's gotta stay in the middle

1621
02:36:54,620 --> 02:37:01,020
Try everything don't try everything that that song implies to try cigarettes. Don't do that

1622
02:37:01,819 --> 02:37:18,250
I'm gonna lose again

1623
02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:22,090

02:40:06,180 --> 02:40:14,739
Oh like I like this one. This one's good. This one's really good. I really like it

1651
02:40:15,459 --> 02:40:26,940
I won. Okay level two where the sky is a different color

1652
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:39,690
That guy that's worth a million points probably

1653
02:40:47,209 --> 02:40:50,420
No

1654
02:40:50,420 --> 02:40:52,420
Sing this for a billion off the debt

1655
02:40:53,930 --> 02:40:56,010
Just because one person says it doesn't mean it's gonna happen

1656
02:40:56,809 --> 02:41:00,020
It needs to be at least a 50 to 60 percent

1657
02:41:00,579 --> 02:41:10,170
Agreeance with everybody in chat here. You got to get at least 10 people on board

1658
02:41:11,190 --> 02:41:14,629
And then those 10 people have to get 20 people on board and those 20 people have to get 100 people on board

1659
02:41:14,709 --> 02:41:16,069
Those 100 people

1660
02:41:16,069 --> 02:41:18,469
Have to get another 500 people on board

1661
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:20,870
and that's how you get

1662
02:41:20,870 --> 02:41:27,670
10 percent of people in this chat that liked the catboy shit to like 70 percent because now I have to dress up this month

1663
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:42,090
I'm gonna beat this game. I'm actually gonna get to the end

1664
02:41:55,540 --> 02:42:11,879
This reminds me of a gamer v portable game. I thought it was a question mark. All right, that was fun. Let's pick one try harder

1665
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:17,190
I don't really do you think a flappy is this flappy bird? You think let's try

1666
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:18,979
Okay

1667
02:42:18,979 --> 02:42:21,909
Flappy push select button

1668
02:42:23,559 --> 02:42:25,559
keyword and music

1669
02:42:25,879 --> 02:42:28,440
input keyword

1670
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:36,469
What's keyword mean?

1671
02:42:36,469 --> 02:42:39,350
Fun and we'll do music

1672
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:47,000
uh

1673
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:53,270
Definitely be I don't care what the other ones are

1674
02:42:53,909 --> 02:42:55,909
This is the bar song

1675
02:42:55,989 --> 02:42:57,350
in undertale

1676
02:42:57,350 --> 02:43:11,479
Okay, what's how you play? It's kind of freaking me out. I have people just locked up in like a cage up there

1677
02:43:11,479 --> 02:43:14,100
And we make them do this shit

1678
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:18,700
um

1679
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:20,459
I don't know how this works

1680
02:43:20,459 --> 02:43:22,459
I have to get the ball on the

1681
02:43:26,940 --> 02:43:29,979
I have to get that. Okay, I get it. Well, just kill me. I didn't get it right

1682
02:43:30,700 --> 02:43:38,739
Okay, so we have to move this out of the way

1683
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:42,659
Can I go over here? Um

1684
02:43:46,260 --> 02:43:49,139
All right, it's one of the it's one of those it's one of these dumbass puzzle games

1685
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:18,930
45

1686
02:44:18,930 --> 02:44:20,899
Chippendale 2

1687
02:44:20,899 --> 02:44:23,620
All right, let's i'm gonna start picking them. Let's do chip and dale

1688
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:26,819
We'll start chip and dale 2 and then we'll go to chip and dale 1 and then 3

1689
02:44:27,219 --> 02:44:35,299
Let's do it like the star wars movies. They take capcom off the top of that. By the way, they just deleted it

1690
02:44:35,299 --> 02:44:50,059
They just put a black over it. That says probably capcom presents. That was a capcom font chip and dale rescue rangers

1691
02:44:53,510 --> 02:45:00,870
Yeah, now it's legal. Yeah, they they removed who made it on the splash screen. Therefore. It's now completely legal to just sell it

1692
02:45:02,729 --> 02:45:04,729
Yeah

1693
02:45:12,489 --> 02:45:17,610
Lots of singing today. All right, I want to be I think I have more connection with dale. I'll be honest

1694
02:45:30,260 --> 02:45:31,299
Uh-oh

1695
02:45:31,299 --> 02:45:35,620
Fat cat has infiltrated the gold facility and took 10 bars of gold

1696
02:45:36,579 --> 02:45:38,579
Chip and dale get on the case

1697
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:45,020
He just broke in here and went that way. You must get him and get our gold back

1698
02:45:49,180 --> 02:45:51,180
I'm ready. I'll get the gold back

1699
02:45:51,659 --> 02:45:56,709
Me and dale will get it

1700
02:45:56,709 --> 02:45:59,899
I don't know what she says

1701
02:45:59,899 --> 02:46:01,579
I wish I could read this

1702
02:46:01,579 --> 02:46:07,020
I thought she thought he's gonna jump right on her head

1703
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:16,299
All right, let's go. We have to introduce every single character that's in the show

1704
02:46:18,170 --> 02:46:20,170
Like get jimmy cricket out of here

1705
02:46:21,059 --> 02:46:23,879
There he is. There's dale

1706
02:46:23,879 --> 02:46:29,000
So dale is uh, if I remember I haven't seen the show or seen them talk in probably 10 years or so

1707
02:46:29,559 --> 02:46:31,559
Dale is like a high-pitched goofy, right?

1708
02:46:34,760 --> 02:46:39,750
It's goofy but higher pitched. Okay, I can read that one

1709
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,260
It's like wow. I

1710
02:46:46,340 --> 02:46:48,680
Hold on. I'll try to get it

1711
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:55,639
I think it's like goofy. It's like goofy, but it's high pitched. It's like this. It's kind of like goofy, but kind of like this

1712
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:59,319
It's like that

1713
02:46:59,319 --> 02:47:01,319
Oh, I don't know about this dale chip

1714
02:47:01,959 --> 02:47:09,450
Let me let me think but it's really it's like the alphan and chipmunks. They pitch it up, right?

1715
02:47:09,610 --> 02:47:19,670
Hold on see if I can get it. I do this. Oh, it's me

1716
02:47:20,549 --> 02:47:24,059
Shit, we gotta get down there and save that gold if we don't get it

1717
02:47:24,059 --> 02:47:32,489
We're gonna be in bad trouble. Is that close goku?

1718
02:47:33,659 --> 02:47:34,870
No

1719
02:47:34,870 --> 02:47:46,729
Now, let me see what it actually sounds like uh chip and dale. Let me hold on

1720
02:47:58,389 --> 02:48:08,229
All right. Okay chip and dale. There's a gadget scene. I just want to hear the voice for a second. I hear it

1721
02:48:11,129 --> 02:48:19,299
Why can I not hear this? I should be able to hear this. Why can I not hear it? Oh

1722
02:48:21,750 --> 02:48:38,250
See how close I was here he comes. Come on dale talk talk dale. Does dale not talk? Did I get it completely wrong?

1723
02:48:38,569 --> 02:48:45,659
I'll admit they do seem to have he doesn't talk

1724
02:48:53,459 --> 02:48:57,159
To contribute some

1725
02:48:57,799 --> 02:49:05,059
Dale doesn't talk. I met I fucked the whole thing up dale doesn't talk. This is chip

1726
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:28,649
I told you it was pitched up like crazy. Dale doesn't talk at all chip and dale rescue rangers. Hold on. I was close

1727
02:49:37,670 --> 02:49:46,200
Yeah, it was close. It was not high pitched enough

1728
02:49:48,579 --> 02:49:54,200
All right, let me get back to play this game

1729
02:49:55,639 --> 02:50:07,559

Why these blocks don't exist I tried to jump game is not even fucking fun game is fucking stupid

1731
02:50:25,139 --> 02:50:32,309

02:50:32,629 --> 02:50:34,389

Let's see what chip and dale 1 is

1739

He swallowed food the same time that I did that's a little weird i'll say all right chip and dale 1

1740
02:51:36,340 --> 02:51:40,100
Walt disney company produced by capcom forgot to scratch that one out

1741
02:51:49,399 --> 02:51:51,399
This actually just is the chip and dale game, isn't it?

1742
02:52:01,989 --> 02:52:14,889
Yeah, this is just this is just the game. I've played it before chip and dale 3

1743

02:52:53,690 --> 02:52:57,340
Well, that's too bad dale gotta start firing

1751
02:53:10,459 --> 02:53:16,379
Why would they do this

1752
02:53:16,379 --> 02:53:23,139
My speakers what happened?

1753
02:53:23,139 --> 02:53:24,899

02:53:47,110 --> 02:53:53,770
It was the what hold on. How's this? Is this different? Is this better? How's this one?

1759
02:53:53,930 --> 02:53:56,010
This is like a little this is this is what I was supposed to be right?

02:53:57,590 --> 02:54:00,549
Yeah, so what happened? I think my like my device like fucked up

1761
02:54:11,799 --> 02:54:17,239
Chip and dale go to like war with fucking flamethrowers and machine guns

1762
02:54:17,959 --> 02:54:27,930
But who are these like other bears? There's like these are bears

Maybe you did do you think they just didn't know that like chip and dale was like a kid's cartoon

1766
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:51,110
Oh, yeah chip and dale. Uh, I guess just

02:54:51,829 --> 02:54:54,309
Just put that I mean that people know who that is

1768
02:55:07,879 --> 02:55:14,420
Got it. Got it. Got it. Nice job dale. He took out that enemy tank

1769
02:55:15,059 --> 02:55:25,350
Let me in out of the front door of the base

1770
02:55:28,620 --> 02:55:35,340
Dale relax. This is like the big smile on your face. This is this is fucked up. Uh,

1771
02:55:52,010 --> 02:55:55,000
Oh stop so waste ammo

1772
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,399
So what game is this actually that they put chip and dale on?

1773
02:56:02,840 --> 02:56:05,430
Of all the things

1774
02:56:05,430 --> 02:56:07,350
Don't waste bullets

1775
02:56:07,350 --> 02:56:10,069
I'll be all right. I mean, this is so many things on the screen

1776
02:56:10,629 --> 02:56:22,790
The chip and dale rescue rangers. I want to get to the boss. This is just chip and dale 3 dude

1777
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:30,469

02:56:30,469 --> 02:56:32,469
Play ace combat get out of here

1779
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:42,299
This is a hack of heavy barrel

1780
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:50,540
It's so funny because they have the other real chip and dale games why even put this one on

1781
02:56:54,840 --> 02:56:59,479
What's the process to add chip and dale 3 but make it a like kill people game?

1782
02:57:07,239 --> 02:57:08,520
grenades

1783
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:15,049
What keys do I need?

1784
02:57:15,049 --> 02:57:18,329
It's for you to scream

1785
02:57:18,329 --> 02:57:23,530
I do not think whoever made this console was concerned about me streaming this console

1786
02:57:24,329 --> 02:57:32,729
If they were

1787
02:57:32,729 --> 02:57:34,809
Uh, I think they would be a little more careful

1788
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:38,200
Of all the uh

1789
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:48,090
Copywritten content that is in it. I'm enjoying chip and dale 3 though. It's actually kind of fun

1790
02:57:51,739 --> 02:57:53,739
Yeah, I can't look at that floor anymore. It hurts so bad

1791
02:57:54,299 --> 02:58:04,219
I can't open those

1792
02:58:04,219 --> 02:58:07,739
I don't get killed by my my own grenade, right? All right. All right. Come on. Let's get a boss

1793
02:58:08,459 --> 02:58:10,700

Fat cat, right? Okay, it better be fat cat

1803
02:58:50,709 --> 02:58:57,690
Dale is the antagonist antagonist pov right now. Is that what you're saying?

1804
02:59:02,090 --> 02:59:10,469
When there's danger

1805
02:59:10,469 --> 02:59:11,590

02:59:31,899 --> 02:59:35,500
Hot blood wrestle hot blood story. I think is what we start with first

1810
02:59:35,819 --> 02:59:49,209
It's just river city ransom, which is an incredible game for the ns. Is it though?

1811
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:54,940
It is it's just river city ransom

1812
02:59:54,940 --> 03:00:02,250
This game used to scare the shit out of me because these ever when they start chasing you with weapons

1813
03:00:02,809 --> 03:00:05,690
It's terrifying

1814
03:00:05,690 --> 03:00:07,690
I love this game. Uh, best part of the game

1815
03:00:08,010 --> 03:00:09,690
Is when you eat the plates

1816
03:00:09,690 --> 03:00:13,770
I'm getting deja vu right now. We did this already didn't we didn't I talk about like oh my god when you eat the plate

1817
03:00:13,850 --> 03:00:15,290
It's so funny

1818
03:00:15,290 --> 03:00:18,790
Did we do this?

1819
03:00:18,790 --> 03:00:20,629
I played this on stream, didn't I?

1820
03:00:20,629 --> 03:00:25,940
Have I never played river city ransom on stream?

1821
03:00:30,170 --> 03:00:34,329
Yeah, you go and you buy food and stuff. It's awesome because you eat the whole plate

1822
03:00:34,409 --> 03:00:36,409
It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a coffee. It could be

1823
03:00:36,569 --> 03:00:38,969
A sushi or like a hamburger doesn't matter

1824
03:00:39,530 --> 03:00:41,209
You eat the entire plate

1825
03:00:41,209 --> 03:00:44,729
Oh, sorry, just like spoiled something fun. I thought you already saw it

1826
03:00:53,399 --> 03:00:58,500
Boss time. I remember boss comes out of here, right? Nobody comes out of here. I hate that

1827
03:00:59,059 --> 03:01:08,299
This game is so good though. Oh shit, please

1828
03:01:11,739 --> 03:01:19,350
I need to try new trash can

1829
03:01:19,350 --> 03:01:20,969
All right, here comes the boss

1830
03:01:20,969 --> 03:01:22,649
He pops out right here

1831
03:01:22,649 --> 03:01:24,629
Is it right here? Is it after?

1832
03:01:24,629 --> 03:01:29,639
Oh, here we go. Okay. Yeah. All right ready to see the fun part

1833
03:01:30,459 --> 03:01:33,239

1834
03:01:33,239 --> 03:01:35,239

1835
03:01:36,540 --> 03:01:37,260

1836
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:40,389
This

1837
03:01:40,389 --> 03:01:42,389
I love that so much. It's so cool

1838
03:01:42,809 --> 03:01:45,850
Oh, it's the best you eat the whole thing in one bite even if it's a plate

1839
03:01:46,489 --> 03:01:56,969
I love it. Where's a coffee?

1840
03:01:57,530 --> 03:02:07,579
Or like tea or something. Can anybody somebody can somebody read this? I need a coffee

1841
03:02:07,979 --> 03:02:14,700
All right. Well, it's just river city ransom, which i'll play it on your own time

1842
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:17,420
It's like one of the best nes games ever made. All right, so what's that? What's the next one?

1843
03:02:17,579 --> 03:02:25,190
It's hot blood wrestle. I mean we have to do that

1844
03:02:27,350 --> 03:02:36,229
1993

1845
03:02:36,229 --> 03:02:39,100
um

1846
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:41,100
Was there another river city ransom?

1847
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:53,190
I I don't remember this. What is this? This is the

1848
03:02:54,069 --> 03:02:56,309
Do you guys ever play dodgeball for the nes?

1849
03:02:58,739 --> 03:03:00,899
I love that game so much. I hope it's on here

1850
03:03:01,540 --> 03:03:07,879
Uh, it doesn't matter what my name is

1851
03:03:07,879 --> 03:03:13,540
It doesn't matter. Let's go

1852
03:03:13,540 --> 03:03:17,190

Yes, okay

1855
03:03:26,309 --> 03:03:28,059
I want to be

03:03:28,059 --> 03:03:31,959
Because it was this fighter brawler

1857
03:03:32,040 --> 03:03:34,040
Uh like scrapper

03:03:34,040 --> 03:03:36,489

Okay

1863
03:03:58,920 --> 03:04:00,920
I don't even know what character I am

1864
03:04:04,469 --> 03:04:06,549
Why did you start off with a lightning move?

1865
03:04:07,430 --> 03:04:09,930
How do I do a lightning move?

1866
03:04:09,930 --> 03:04:16,889
Get away from my friend

1867
03:04:20,629 --> 03:04:22,629
I can't tell who's winning, but I think we're doing okay

1868
03:04:23,110 --> 03:04:37,819
Oh my god, somebody's gave a shitload of subs. I just gave 50 community subs

1869
03:04:40,010 --> 03:04:42,010
Zap x gave 50 subs

03:04:42,489 --> 03:04:44,329
That's a fucking ton

1871
03:04:44,329 --> 03:04:46,489
Too many too many subs. What's this weapon?

1872
03:04:47,739 --> 03:04:49,180
We sort of pin him

1873
03:04:49,180 --> 03:04:50,940
Oh his friend is gone. All right

1874
03:04:50,940 --> 03:05:00,329
Yeah, get him. I just killed my own friend. Oops

1875
03:05:01,049 --> 03:05:03,049
What do you like he left health?

1876
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:07,989

Oh, the the spam is what the game actually is. Okay

1880
03:05:26,420 --> 03:05:36,139
That's it. It's a huge pog face. That's an omega pog

1881
03:05:38,090 --> 03:05:40,090
Two omega pods

1882
03:05:40,090 --> 03:05:43,979
This is made by the guilty gear devs. That's interesting

1883
03:05:44,620 --> 03:05:50,329
All right, let's get a random one

1884
03:05:50,329 --> 03:05:52,409
I'm having fun. I love this. This is like a bunch of fun

1885
03:05:54,780 --> 03:05:58,219
It's just a shitty game loot box. You just open up a random number

1886
03:06:00,629 --> 03:06:02,629
Some of them are actually real games

1887
03:06:04,979 --> 03:06:08,020
Hexapoo man. No hexapoo new

1888

Uh, is this spray paint? What is this?

1891
03:06:42,940 --> 03:06:52,540
It's like a water can do I have to shoot the ladybug. This is kind of cool. I like this

1892
03:06:52,620 --> 03:06:55,989
All right, i'm gonna be here for a minute

1893
03:06:55,989 --> 03:06:59,510
And one level one complete presents to start hexapod

1894
03:07:00,149 --> 03:07:03,399
level two

1895
03:07:03,399 --> 03:07:19,899
Is this like just centipede but not a centipede I guess. Okay. I cool. I guess. Oh shit. They're getting close

1896
03:07:21,209 --> 03:07:23,209
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1897
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:28,100
What am I preventing them from turning into flowers? Why is this cool? This is like bad

1898
03:07:29,139 --> 03:07:35,850
This is bug spray

1899
03:07:35,850 --> 03:07:41,340
All right, one more level and i'm done last one

1900
03:07:53,100 --> 03:07:54,299
I can't

1901
03:07:54,299 --> 03:07:59,270
I can't i'm gonna say I hit the escape right off. It's not escape. It's reset actually

1902
03:08:01,819 --> 03:08:02,780
It's like

1903
03:08:02,780 --> 03:08:05,020
Yeah, every this hurts

1904
03:08:05,020 --> 03:08:09,979
You ever play a game or something and it's just you just need to move your body around because blah you just hate

1905
03:08:10,139 --> 03:08:11,420
I can't stop

1906
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:20,920
All right. How about um, let's pick a good one

1907
03:08:21,639 --> 03:08:26,950
Mortal Kombat 4

1908
03:08:29,989 --> 03:08:32,360
Superman

1909
03:08:42,649 --> 03:08:44,360
Okay

1910
03:08:44,360 --> 03:08:49,719
There's how many I don't even know how many characters is this a match three game or is this the character selector?

1911
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:53,399
I thought it was a match three game. Okay, this is Sonya

1912
03:08:58,120 --> 03:09:00,950
What the fuck?

1913
03:09:00,950 --> 03:09:02,950
Sonya versus nightwolf

1914
03:09:10,120 --> 03:09:13,239
It actually is mortal kombat but not

1915
03:09:13,959 --> 03:09:15,000
at all

1916
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:21,850
I'm getting destroyed

1917
03:09:21,850 --> 03:09:24,250
Okay. So hold on if this is Sonya, who's the other Sonya?

1918
03:09:24,889 --> 03:09:33,780
Because there's like five Sonya's on that character select pick the green sub zero

1919
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:38,040
You know what? The best part about this is this blood

1920
03:09:39,079 --> 03:09:43,319
They tried to keep it as authentic as possible with member original blood in mortal kombat

1921
03:09:45,059 --> 03:09:50,819
All the parents all the legislation that was like this is bad. There's blood in this video games people. That's just it's disgusting. It's horrible

1922
03:09:51,620 --> 03:10:02,620
They kept that

1923
03:10:02,620 --> 03:10:10,420
I lost. All right. Hold on reset. I i'm going to pick another character

1924
03:10:10,739 --> 03:10:20,809
I want to pick green sub zero and see what it is. Where is

1925
03:10:21,930 --> 03:10:26,950
What even is this? This is uh cano

1926
03:10:28,229 --> 03:10:30,229
This is sub zero, right?

1927
03:10:30,309 --> 03:10:37,559
Is this striker?

1928
03:10:37,559 --> 03:10:42,440
It's kratos

1929
03:10:42,440 --> 03:10:44,600
Um, where's that's sub zero, right?

1930
03:10:48,780 --> 03:10:51,180
Is it don't johnny cage? No, johnny case has sunglasses

1931
03:10:51,819 --> 03:11:02,549
We're gonna be red sub zero

1932
03:11:02,549 --> 03:11:04,549
Liu kang versus nightwolf

1933
03:11:09,530 --> 03:11:10,889
No, it wasn't

1934
03:11:10,889 --> 03:11:13,590
I gotta see if I can do the kick

1935
03:11:13,590 --> 03:11:16,790
What's the button combination to do the actual kick move?

1936
03:11:27,909 --> 03:11:33,079
Just keep him in the corner. Wait, can I do the sweep?

1937
03:11:33,719 --> 03:11:38,139
This game doesn't wait. It doesn't have a sweep

1938
03:11:46,969 --> 03:11:52,090
Is there wait, we need to see if there's a finisher if there's fatalities in this i'm gonna laugh my ass off

1939
03:11:52,649 --> 03:11:54,010
Up down kick

1940
03:11:54,010 --> 03:12:08,020
Fuck he's supposed to be in the face. All right. I want to try to get fatality dude

1941
03:12:09,659 --> 03:12:11,459
Wait

1942
03:12:11,459 --> 03:12:13,459
Is that shao khan?

1943
03:12:14,180 --> 03:12:16,790
That's not nightwolf

1944
03:12:16,790 --> 03:12:22,620
That hasn't been nightwolf this whole time

1945
03:12:29,530 --> 03:12:40,280
I was wondering something fell off about him. That's a lot of blood

1946
03:12:44,219 --> 03:12:49,719
Did I won?

1947
03:12:49,719 --> 03:12:56,750
Just had to make sure he was extra dead fatality

1948
03:12:57,590 --> 03:13:17,940
All right. This is striker red striker is who it's just striker. Okay. Oh wait, is that the bicycle kick?

1949
03:13:20,739 --> 03:13:24,819
Forward punch forward forward kick forward forward kick back forward kick back back kick back back kick

1950
03:13:29,750 --> 03:13:32,790
Back back kick back back forward kick back back forward kick back back forward kick

1951
03:13:33,510 --> 03:13:37,100
Back back forward kick

1952
03:13:37,100 --> 03:13:38,540
Just kill me. Whatever

1953
03:13:38,540 --> 03:13:58,500
Another 15 subs from scrumpleton scrumpleton. Thanks for the 15th sub. It's a fucking lot of stuff

1954
03:13:59,139 --> 03:14:03,139
A lot of subs right now. All right. Uh, I don't know what this is, but i'm gonna pick it

1955
03:14:03,780 --> 03:14:13,180
It's just shang seng. All right. No, it's not

1956
03:14:13,819 --> 03:14:21,940
Wait, no, it's not

1957
03:14:21,940 --> 03:14:43,479
I'm gonna get perfect. I'm literally about to get perfected. I can't even attack him. Wait. Wait, am I striker? What's happening?

1958
03:14:43,479 --> 03:14:45,479
I just was pressing buttons strikers

1959
03:14:47,930 --> 03:14:55,430
Who am I? I'm not even playing the game. I'm not playing I was not playing I was not playing the game

1960
03:14:57,030 --> 03:15:03,819
They were big bits too. Oh, there was a hundred bucks. Holy shit. Okay, uh valemi. Thanks for the hundred dollars

1961
03:15:05,030 --> 03:15:07,030
Although I don't read bits anymore

1962
03:15:07,510 --> 03:15:11,579
I do not read bit messages anymore. We talked about how I

1963
03:15:12,219 --> 03:15:15,219
wanted to move away from that and

1964
03:15:16,010 --> 03:15:18,229
Uh, that's kind of the way it is

1965
03:15:18,229 --> 03:15:20,870
So for those of you that don't know if you might not have been here for a while

1966
03:15:20,870 --> 03:15:26,809
I do I no longer read bits because it got to a point where I took bits away from the end of the stream

1967
03:15:26,889 --> 03:15:32,700
I stopped reading them, but I still was reading like a hundred dollar bits and I find that to be a precedent

1968
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:37,299
I do not want to set people to uh, try to

1969
03:15:38,260 --> 03:15:45,020
Essentially, I don't want to have it be a thing where people give me money and I i'm gonna like read it out loud

1970
03:15:45,959 --> 03:15:47,959
And I don't want to set that precedence for people

1971
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:52,200
To like feel like they have to pay me money like an insane amount of money

1972
03:15:52,600 --> 03:15:55,219
To try to get me to like read something

1973
03:15:55,860 --> 03:15:59,100
I don't want that precedence to be set at all

1974
03:15:59,100 --> 03:16:02,459
So I stopped reading bits of the uh, it used to be 250

1975
03:16:03,290 --> 03:16:07,610
And if somebody wants to me to read something, I don't want to be like I have to give this guy a hundred fucking dollars

1976
03:16:07,610 --> 03:16:17,479
So he will not read it. So that's something I don't want to have happen. That's why I kind of stopped reading bits completely

1977
03:16:21,430 --> 03:16:23,430
Please god read this

1978
03:16:27,940 --> 03:16:30,379
You're a wholesome fucker

1979
03:16:30,379 --> 03:16:36,120
No, I just don't want people to have to drop that kind of money to have me read something

1980
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:42,040
You know, I'd rather just pick it out of chat and I still if somebody gives community subs

1981
03:16:42,040 --> 03:16:47,540
I still read them. I still just read the fact that they were given but there's no message attached to the community subs or anything

1982
03:16:47,540 --> 03:16:53,819
It's just sort of um, and people get the subs. It's not just me receiving like a hundred dollars in bits

1983
03:16:55,850 --> 03:16:57,850
So that's why the kind of the idea

1984
03:16:58,010 --> 03:17:01,770
I just don't ever want it to get to a point where people need to spend an insane amount of money to

1985
03:17:01,930 --> 03:17:18,040
And i'll read it he doesn't know how to read no, but I I do know how to read bird week study the game

1986
03:17:22,069 --> 03:17:38,329
All right. I need to study the game was there to study. How is this just not playing the game?

1987
03:17:45,750 --> 03:17:48,950
How is this different than just playing the what about how is this studying the game

1988
03:17:51,479 --> 03:18:02,120
You have to eat the butterflies

1989
03:18:02,120 --> 03:18:04,120
Why do I keep running into that bird? I'm so stupid

1990
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:11,670
Speaking of subs, we got 10 from anonymous and then 10 from shock too. So thanks both you guys. Oh my god. I'm fucking

1991
03:18:12,309 --> 03:18:14,170
Bird week sucks

1992
03:18:14,170 --> 03:18:17,370
Although I wish there was a bird week on that shark week channel discovery

1993
03:18:18,100 --> 03:18:20,739
We get shark week. I don't care about shark week. I would want bird week

1994
03:18:20,739 --> 03:18:32,700
I'm more interested in birds time for mario 10 super mario super brothers kung fu mari

1995
03:18:39,420 --> 03:18:40,860
super mario

1996
03:18:40,860 --> 03:18:44,440
kung fu mario

1997
03:18:44,600 --> 03:18:47,879
When he just jumps up, he's got like a human body

1998
03:18:48,600 --> 03:18:51,559
Like a wait, he has he has a human body, doesn't he?

1999
03:18:56,309 --> 03:18:59,350
That's just this mario 2 mario mario 3

2000
03:19:02,040 --> 03:19:04,280
He's huge. Yeah, he's like six five

2001
03:19:05,079 --> 03:19:13,930
There's a knight

2002
03:19:13,930 --> 03:19:15,930
A lot of random assets in this game

2003
03:19:16,489 --> 03:19:24,629
You know what's bizarre about this though? I really could I really feel like this could be one of those mario games that came out

2004
03:19:26,549 --> 03:19:31,110
25 years ago or just regular nintendo or super nintendo that nobody talks about nobody hears about anymore

2005
03:19:33,190 --> 03:19:36,389
What was that one mario and time like luigi stuck in time or something?

2006
03:19:40,020 --> 03:19:42,579
If there was a mario yahtzee game like this could be real

2007
03:19:46,500 --> 03:19:48,739
Mario is missing. Yeah, that's one right. Yeah, that's one

2008
03:19:54,870 --> 03:20:00,569
A giant tiger

2009
03:20:00,809 --> 03:20:03,129
Just getting mauled by a tiger in mario

2010
03:20:10,010 --> 03:20:12,170
Very hyper realistic tiger. Yeah

2011
03:20:15,979 --> 03:20:17,979
I wish there were mario sounds in this

2012
03:20:18,979 --> 03:20:24,100
they're like

2013
03:20:37,579 --> 03:20:42,059
Losing focus. Yeah, i'm i'm i've my brain has one road

2014
03:20:44,389 --> 03:20:49,829
It's a one lane highway

2015
03:20:49,829 --> 03:20:54,309
It just goes in a straight line and if you if you tell me I need to take a turn off that highway. Nope

2016
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:59,559
I can't have more lanes. It can't be more than one car on that road. It's just one fucking road

2017
03:21:00,440 --> 03:21:02,440
And it's long and it's huge

2018
03:21:08,500 --> 03:21:12,500
But that car can go 500 miles per hour

2019
03:21:18,340 --> 03:21:20,340
It's a it's a lamborghini on that road

2020
03:21:20,819 --> 03:21:24,569
What mario character is this?

2021
03:21:24,569 --> 03:21:31,530
It's actually not even that it's actually kind of a fun game

2022
03:21:32,329 --> 03:21:35,850
That was it was toad

2023
03:21:36,170 --> 03:21:37,530
Krillin

2024
03:21:37,530 --> 03:21:40,889
Wait, was it who was that? That person was so small

2025
03:21:41,610 --> 03:21:45,049
That person was like three times smaller than me and he's jacked who i've just realized

2026
03:21:46,440 --> 03:21:48,469
oh

2027
03:21:48,469 --> 03:21:50,469
No, I thought it was a boss

2028
03:21:50,469 --> 03:21:53,510
Auto scroller, of course, it'd be an auto scroll in a mario game. Why not?

2029
03:21:54,389 --> 03:22:03,500
All right for all the shit talking. It's not even that bad of a designed video game

2030
03:22:04,219 --> 03:22:06,040
It's not bad

2031
03:22:06,040 --> 03:22:10,309
It's just a little weird

2032
03:22:10,389 --> 03:22:12,389
Oh shit. Okay. I'm good

2033
03:22:12,469 --> 03:22:22,840
It's scrolling very fast. Yeah, it is

2034
03:22:29,379 --> 03:22:32,420
They even put the ah, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha in the game

2035
03:22:33,219 --> 03:22:35,540
I love mario 10. It's my favorite mario

2036
03:22:42,139 --> 03:22:45,819
Vertical scroll now. Wow change it up. I'm impressed

2037
03:22:46,620 --> 03:22:55,379
I'm impressed

2038
03:22:55,379 --> 03:23:06,729
That was a football player or soccer players have to play mario 7

2039
03:23:07,780 --> 03:23:11,930

2040
03:23:13,030 --> 03:23:15,719

Oh, it's it's the it's the thing in mario 64 in the in the middle of the pyramid

2042
03:23:38,459 --> 03:23:40,459

03:23:40,780 --> 03:23:46,629
Come on get him

03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:39,100
No, no, I just the game is weird if you if I touch a symbol if I hit x it clear. It's weird

Holy shit. I just destroyed the entire thing chef mario

2080
03:29:27,639 --> 03:29:32,739
You guys ever think that if nintendo ever decided to make a theme park think about all the marios

2081
03:29:32,739 --> 03:29:39,780
They would be if you go to disneyland or disney world. There's chef mickey. There's rodeo mickey. There's magic mickey magician mickey

There's library and glasses mickey now imagine how many marios they would be you can have a mario for every occasion chef mario

2083
03:29:48,780 --> 03:29:55,850
They could be like archaeologist mario. Why would they not do that? I know there is one but

2084
03:29:57,420 --> 03:30:07,659
Is it like licensed officially by nintendo? It is yeah

2085
03:30:07,659 --> 03:30:12,459
But what it wasn't like it's like two rides and like one little pop-up thing or something

2086
03:30:12,459 --> 03:30:23,020
I'm talking about like a disney world for nintendo like an entire theme park. That's nintendo. Look it up

2087
03:30:24,659 --> 03:30:26,659
I I feel like that i'm getting lied to

2088
03:30:27,059 --> 03:30:35,350
Nintendo land or nintendo park nintendo theme park super nintendo world is an upcoming theme park

2089

03:31:03,030 --> 03:31:07,290
The theme park is based on the nintendo video game franchise

03:31:08,459 --> 03:31:13,510
What at universal studios japan super nintendo world is wedged in the wedged. Mmm

Power up band key challenges a power up band and the official app are both required to experience the attraction

2099
03:31:39,190 --> 03:31:44,649
This is going to be the one up factory for dining hino pio's cafe for a little bit of shopping

2104
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:31,579
What fuck disney and nintendo capitalist scum?

2105
03:32:34,090 --> 03:32:36,729
All right, i'm not gonna play mario anymore

2106
03:32:42,280 --> 03:32:54,680
scum jerry

2107
03:32:56,059 --> 03:32:58,860
George I don't understand why you're still playing mario

He's in the corner. There's like mountain duke hands all over the place. I just need one more moon and then i'm done with this

2111
03:33:23,319 --> 03:33:40,659
little bastard forever

2112
03:33:40,659 --> 03:33:45,299
Recreate an episode of seinfeld on stream with doctor schmeichsen. Why doctor schmeichsen?

2113
03:33:46,309 --> 03:33:50,149
But why does he have to be on that stream? I guess he could be but I mean why

2114
03:33:51,610 --> 03:33:56,090
Why I guess why not? Yeah, that's true

2115
03:33:56,729 --> 03:34:12,100
All right. This one was fun, but i'm done. Do you guys understand that as we get older?

2116
03:34:13,860 --> 03:34:21,209
sitcoms are going to be that they're going to make these jokes because

2117
03:34:21,530 --> 03:34:25,290
When our parents were watching these sitcoms from you know, 20 30 years ago

2118
03:34:25,610 --> 03:34:31,350
It was exactly what was kind of kind of big and in at the time

2119
03:34:31,989 --> 03:34:34,229
Whatever was currently like the thing that people cared about

2120
03:34:34,709 --> 03:34:35,989
10 to 20 years later

2121
03:34:35,989 --> 03:34:41,459
They try to hit the nostalgia on it too because they know they're going for what there's a certain audience. There's going to be

2122
03:34:42,549 --> 03:34:49,159
Sitcom like gamer stuff. It's going to be everywhere. They already do

2123
03:34:49,239 --> 03:34:52,120
Oh, no, but it's going to be it's going to be a major part of almost every single tv show

2124
03:34:52,360 --> 03:35:15,590
They do now a few do maybe a few mario 14. This looks like a continuation from

2125
03:35:17,059 --> 03:35:23,530
Uh

2126
03:35:23,530 --> 03:35:35,920
Neither of these are mario. That's not mario either. Is that it's mario's messenger

2127
03:35:54,440 --> 03:35:56,620
He transformed that's his transformation

That was he grew a little bit. It just gave they just gave him a mario head

2130
03:36:06,379 --> 03:36:09,819
They didn't even try with this one. They did not give a fuck with this one at all

2131
03:36:10,459 --> 03:36:12,860
This is superimposed on this whatever game this actually is

2132
03:36:18,280 --> 03:36:20,280
What this is so powerful?

2133
03:36:20,840 --> 03:36:23,559
What's wrong with my guy?

2134
03:36:23,559 --> 03:36:25,079
Why am I what's happening?

2135
03:36:25,079 --> 03:36:28,469
Why am I blinking?

2136
03:36:29,270 --> 03:36:31,270

Hey, good luck mario. You'll never beat my wario game

03:36:40,549 --> 03:36:49,959
This is a double jump

2140
03:36:49,959 --> 03:36:58,059
You'll never beat my wario game goku. I can't just add goku to everything with that voice. It's gonna get old

2141
03:36:58,379 --> 03:37:01,959
I can't do that

2142
03:37:01,959 --> 03:37:04,120
I can't you I don't want to burn that

2143
03:37:08,059 --> 03:37:10,059
That transformation though is unbelievable

2144
03:37:10,700 --> 03:37:19,340
At least I mean this is very much the

2145
03:37:20,059 --> 03:37:22,219

2148
03:37:41,270 --> 03:37:59,620
Literal different character can I get under there forgot to put the sprite in on that one man

This music could be in a mario game and I would like it wouldn't you

2151
03:38:07,639 --> 03:38:14,329
They're gonna serve alcohol at nintendo land

Kaluha and and uh like mint and strawberry and like syrup and stuff. I I they don't not gonna do that

2156
03:38:36,219 --> 03:38:50,389
You can't go one day without drinking

2157
03:38:51,190 --> 03:38:53,190
I drink like three times a year

2158
03:39:03,420 --> 03:39:11,719
Um interesting interesting how uh when you hold b down for long enough

2159
03:39:12,600 --> 03:39:14,760
Mario's mustache goes on the back of his head

2160
03:39:15,399 --> 03:39:28,940
Fucking hard

2161
03:39:28,940 --> 03:39:30,940
All that for that don't die from this

2162
03:39:33,590 --> 03:39:35,030
No keys what?

2163
03:39:35,030 --> 03:39:37,030
Shit, did I miss a key? What'd I miss one?

2164
03:39:44,819 --> 03:39:47,219
Did I did I jump over it? Did I miss it completely?

2165
03:39:48,629 --> 03:39:51,510
I was busy. Oh, I was busy. I was busy

2166
03:39:52,469 --> 03:39:54,469
God damn it. I was busy

2167
03:39:54,870 --> 03:39:56,229
I was busy

2168
03:39:56,229 --> 03:40:03,659
I was busy and I didn't see it

2169
03:40:06,139 --> 03:40:09,340
What were you doing? I I was busy. I was looking at something

2170
03:40:09,979 --> 03:40:31,129
It's two different songs playing at the same time. It's freaking me out. This game's awesome though. I like this game

2171
03:40:31,129 --> 03:40:33,129
Just the actual video game whatever they're

2172
03:40:33,850 --> 03:40:37,180
Copyrighted stealing. Oh jesus. I'm in trouble

2173
03:40:43,530 --> 03:40:57,659
Uh, okay, he comes back up to get his I haven't heard him. I can't hurt him. I guess I can

2174
03:40:58,379 --> 03:41:05,350
I can't even

2175
03:41:05,350 --> 03:41:09,909
I'll watch it. He's shooting the fireballs. You can't how he's supposed to dodge those. You cannot get away from that

2176
03:41:12,739 --> 03:41:16,020
Why are these not hurting him to be standing in this corner? I can't hurt him

2177
03:41:24,629 --> 03:41:48,100
Jump over them. Yeah, but like why can't I hurt him? God damn it. Just jump over him. Just jump over him

2178
03:41:49,239 --> 03:41:51,719

I have no idea what's going on, dude

2181
03:42:27,180 --> 03:42:33,260
This might look simple to you, but it's requiring like seven million math problems for me to not get hit by this stuff

2182
03:42:35,139 --> 03:42:39,219
Remember the controller hitting left doesn't work like 45 percent of the time

2183
03:42:39,860 --> 03:43:02,389
I don't care. It's her it's terrible being the controller blame the controller. Not the game, right?

2184
03:43:02,389 --> 03:43:04,389
Yeah, I will blame the controller when I hit left

2185
03:43:12,010 --> 03:43:26,420
Case closed pro wrestling time player ready

This is

2257
03:48:43,620 --> 03:48:46,180
The only way you can get back

2258
03:48:46,819 --> 03:48:48,819

You have no choice

2262
03:49:05,180 --> 03:49:10,700

Astonax let's go

2266
03:49:20,250 --> 03:49:21,940
Astonax

2267
03:49:21,940 --> 03:49:27,819
This does not look anything like the person that was just talking

2268
03:49:30,069 --> 03:49:56,059
Um, it's pretty sick gameplay. I like it. Yeah, it lost me. It lost me really quickly. Let's generate one 314

2269
03:50:02,700 --> 03:50:08,940
Oh, yeah, we've seen utmost warfare already. We've already done one 205. Let's see

2270
03:50:12,409 --> 03:50:14,409
205 is air alert

2271
03:50:17,989 --> 03:50:19,989
You watched more cutscene than played. Yeah

2273
03:50:25,340 --> 03:50:27,340
so many of these

2274
03:50:28,469 --> 03:50:35,430
That was a planet that was just coming in why was I glitching

2275
03:50:38,899 --> 03:50:51,459
This is quite the invasion this is a full-on invasion mario 7 waiting room

2276
03:50:54,260 --> 03:51:08,950
I think this is it. This is all there is to it. That's yeah, that's all there is to that one

2277
03:51:15,290 --> 03:51:18,940
How about uh, what about double dragon? Let's see if it's just actually double dragon

2278
03:51:19,579 --> 03:51:31,399
I think so

2279
03:51:31,399 --> 03:51:32,600

2284
03:52:15,299 --> 03:52:26,360
Kind of weird looking

2285
03:52:26,360 --> 03:52:30,969
Yeah, we've seen it already. We don't want real games. We need

2286

2294
03:53:48,819 --> 03:53:52,899
They talked about in the 60s with adam west. He was purple right purple and black and gray

2295
03:53:53,860 --> 03:53:55,579
Yeah, he was

2296
03:53:55,579 --> 03:54:04,170
They just didn't add the other two colors. That's fine. Does that say meat eat?

He's going completely fucking purple

2320
03:56:01,420 --> 03:56:03,420
Except for the yellow in the middle

2321
03:56:03,579 --> 03:56:10,870
And why is he on an elmo phone?

2322
03:56:15,370 --> 03:56:19,319
That's blue. That is

2323
03:56:19,319 --> 03:56:21,319
That's not blue. That's purple

2324

That's purple. How is that blue? You think that's blue? Yeah, you say get your screen check

2325
03:56:28,219 --> 03:56:30,219
Some of you guys need to get your eyeglasses examined

That's purple

2327
03:56:35,850 --> 03:56:39,930
That's lilac. Okay. All right. I've heard about enough

2328
03:56:41,159 --> 03:56:43,159
I've heard just about enough

2329
03:56:43,639 --> 03:56:45,639
It's lilac

2330
03:56:54,700 --> 03:56:55,899
Lilac

2331
03:56:55,899 --> 03:56:58,969
No, it's not purple. It's fuchsia

03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:05,590
No, it's lavender jeremy

2333
03:57:15,770 --> 03:57:18,010
Take the colorblind test already did and I got 100 on it

2334
03:57:21,100 --> 03:57:25,659
I got one of the highest scores you could possibly possibly get on that test. It was like a 150

2335
03:57:26,459 --> 03:57:37,850
100 percent colorblind. No

2336
03:57:42,069 --> 03:57:46,950
Silent

2337
03:57:46,950 --> 03:57:49,989
Hi, who's the where's the boss? I want to see the first boss penguin, right?

2338
03:57:50,709 --> 03:58:05,670
Don't die. Oh, you're actually you guys are listening. Well, very very you guys are very very good listeners right now

2339
03:58:06,229 --> 03:58:12,549
That guy was just smoking a cigarette. I'm not even sure he's a bad guy

2340
03:58:12,549 --> 03:58:14,549
But whatever you're in batman's way get out of the way

2341
03:58:15,190 --> 03:58:18,340
If you see batman fucking sprinting down

2342
03:58:20,819 --> 03:58:22,420
You get out of his way

2343
03:58:22,420 --> 03:58:24,420
um, I don't know who this is but

2344
03:58:24,500 --> 03:58:28,920
They got me

2345
03:58:28,920 --> 03:58:32,280
I think this is just a uh, extra bad guy. This is not like a batman character

2346
03:58:33,510 --> 03:58:51,180
All right

2347
03:58:51,180 --> 03:58:53,180
It's so it's fucking so hard

2348
03:58:54,549 --> 03:59:00,280
fake fan

2349
03:59:00,280 --> 03:59:05,719

Live-action batman television series of the 1960s starring adam west featured a blue purple and gray version of the batsuit with the cape shortened

2354
03:59:25,899 --> 03:59:30,579

03:59:30,579 --> 03:59:32,579
Uh, what is it? What am I doing?

2356
03:59:38,840 --> 04:00:01,620
Um, this doesn't reach

2357
04:00:01,620 --> 04:00:10,260
I did it. This is kind of cool. Look at that cow down there. Look at how cool that cow is

2358
04:00:11,370 --> 04:00:13,370
Oh my god. I love this one

2359
04:00:13,610 --> 04:00:16,420
Look at he's like hello. It should be mr. Cow

2360
04:00:17,059 --> 04:00:25,750
I love that cow

2361
04:00:25,750 --> 04:00:32,340
I get the cow too. It was a detective comics

2362
04:00:33,379 --> 04:00:42,520
Yeah, he's purple. It's purple dude. Oops

2363
04:00:43,159 --> 04:01:00,139
This is the same level. Did I not do it stage four? I didn't they get all these e's

2364
04:01:04,059 --> 04:01:06,700
Destroy the balls leading up to the knock the tower down

2365
04:01:07,340 --> 04:01:14,709
And I just fly in there

2366
04:01:14,709 --> 04:01:24,889
Uh, I don't know. What do I do? I don't know what that does

2367
04:01:25,530 --> 04:01:30,280
Give me like powers

2368
04:01:30,280 --> 04:01:43,770
destroy the wall

2369
04:01:44,010 --> 04:01:45,129
powers

2370
04:01:45,129 --> 04:01:52,629
Oh wait, I can what's the point of the balls then if I can just break this? What was the point of the walls?

2371
04:02:03,260 --> 04:02:05,260
the store p

2372
04:02:05,260 --> 04:02:07,260
Oh

2373
04:02:07,739 --> 04:02:13,340
Come on dude, why of all the things do I have to think about that one?

2374
04:02:30,700 --> 04:02:38,409
Nice, ah, yeah, that was that was good. That was very good. You get that one. Absolutely

2375
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:52,299
That was that was very good. All right, this one's cute, but I think i'm done

2376
04:02:55,159 --> 04:02:56,360
What the hell?

2377
04:02:56,360 --> 04:03:10,040
Yeah, that was fun. Let's get a random one

2378
04:03:12,090 --> 04:03:14,729
Two three four. We're going four. Oh nine

2379
04:03:19,989 --> 04:03:23,479
spider-man one

2380
04:03:23,479 --> 04:03:49,579
Okay stage one three lives spider-man. Oh, what did I think I lost? Okay, I can

2381
04:03:50,139 --> 04:04:03,139
All right. I get it. I get it. So you got to climb around. This is definitely, uh green goblins

2382
04:04:04,260 --> 04:04:05,940
Design work. I know it

2383
04:04:05,940 --> 04:04:20,969
The song is awful for a spider-man. This should be way more upbeat

2384
04:04:24,120 --> 04:04:34,739
This does not feel like spider-man music at all. And when does this end the enemy has full health?

2385
04:04:36,700 --> 04:04:57,030
What enemy am I supposed to be shooting at enemy full health? Well, I want to see spider-man too for oh, sorry

2386
04:05:05,700 --> 04:05:10,409
Different pose and this time we're climbing on the wall. Okay

2387
04:05:11,739 --> 04:05:14,159
That's doll. That's dr. Octopus

2388
04:05:18,979 --> 04:05:20,979
Okay, I have homing missiles

2389
04:05:21,739 --> 04:05:23,180
If he touches me, I

2390
04:05:23,180 --> 04:05:30,500
Okay, just spam a and you'll win. All right, beat him stage two dr. Octopus again

2391
04:05:31,299 --> 04:05:35,959
I guess

2392
04:05:35,959 --> 04:05:39,079
Oh my god, this is painful stop doing that

2393
04:05:45,020 --> 04:05:47,020
Stage three dr. Octopus again

2394
04:05:47,100 --> 04:05:52,700
Are we ever going to see another character?

2395
04:05:52,700 --> 04:05:56,059
There's a glitch right if you get to the top left part of his shoulder you can spam it

2396
04:05:56,700 --> 04:06:01,850
It's the only place you can do that. Let's get right to the top left shoulder area here

2397
04:06:05,430 --> 04:06:07,430
If he would stop doing that

2398
04:06:09,340 --> 04:06:24,780
Stage five dr. Octopus

2399
04:06:24,780 --> 04:06:27,659
I don't think there's anything else. I don't think this one has anything else in it

2400
04:06:35,829 --> 04:06:39,510
Every time he touches you it resets the whole game. Holy shit. This is awful

2401
04:06:40,229 --> 04:06:44,120
I'm gonna after stage 10 if it's still dr. Octopus. I'm leaving

2402
04:06:53,909 --> 04:06:56,329
Nope. All right stage eight

2403
04:07:03,739 --> 04:07:07,579
He has so much health as this goes forward. Oh my god

2404
04:07:08,299 --> 04:07:21,850
Okay stage 10. This is gonna be it. It's gotta be the last one

2405
04:07:22,409 --> 04:07:30,420
It looks like a stink bug. He yeah, he does

2406
04:07:31,059 --> 04:07:37,270
It's that one spot on the shoulder though. All right, what if I'm still here just i'm gonna turn the volume down

2407
04:07:37,590 --> 04:07:39,590
I need to see what happens after 15

2408
04:07:46,620 --> 04:07:56,299
Let me get i'll use 20 once I get to 20. That's it. Fuck. He's he's shooting more

2409
04:07:59,290 --> 04:08:01,370
It's 20 i'll get 20 when it gets 20 20 is over

2410
04:08:02,819 --> 04:08:04,659
25 well

2411
04:08:04,659 --> 04:08:23,190
Hold on. Oh, by the way, I don't have to tap it. Hold on if I hold it. It does it too. Wait a minute

2412
04:08:29,639 --> 04:08:37,159
And if I hit the turbo button what happens? No, it's faster without turbo

2413
04:08:46,729 --> 04:09:09,129
19 last one. Okay, let's say is it is it last one? I promise you lost a thousand years. I'm sorry

2414
04:09:09,129 --> 04:09:16,819
I wanted to see what was gonna happen. I want to see if we got another boss or is it do 420?

2415
04:09:16,819 --> 04:09:32,389
All right, fine. I'll do the funny meme number wonder ball. A lot of them have the same format here. Okay wonder ball

2416
04:09:33,110 --> 04:09:45,860
I think i'm winning

2417
04:09:45,860 --> 04:09:52,250
Absolutely. No idea what's going on. I'm not controlling anything. I'm not shooting that i'm not firing it. It's just doing it on its own

2418
04:09:55,000 --> 04:10:03,899
This is randomly ai generated music. I think this is just a little toy. That's fun to look at for kids or something

2419
04:10:06,579 --> 04:10:16,250
I don't have control of this. I don't have control of this

2420
04:10:20,469 --> 04:10:22,149
I can pause the game

2421
04:10:22,149 --> 04:10:28,379
How's your sunday going? It's doing pretty good. Hope your sunday's going well. I can't this is not a video game

2422
04:10:28,379 --> 04:10:32,010
I can't play it

2423
04:10:32,010 --> 04:10:35,270
Sing wonder wall

2424
04:10:35,270 --> 04:10:37,270
I don't know the lyrics. I just know how it goes

2425
04:10:41,829 --> 04:10:45,989
Hmm chubby cherub. Yeah, let's do chubby chubby cherub

2426
04:10:47,639 --> 04:10:51,610

This must be cupid. I don't get it

2428
04:11:04,860 --> 04:11:32,329
What's about the dogs? Holy shit. The baby got stuck on the power line. Oh, no

2429
04:11:33,049 --> 04:11:35,750
No, no, no

2430
04:11:35,750 --> 04:11:41,819
dead fox gorilla war gobble bobble. This is bubble bubble tube

2431
04:11:44,790 --> 04:11:49,350
Now it is beginning of a fantastic story. Let's make a journey to the cave of monsters. Good luck

2432
04:11:51,750 --> 04:11:55,450
Oh, hell. Yeah

2433
04:11:55,450 --> 04:11:57,450
It's just bubble bubble too

2434
04:12:01,979 --> 04:12:03,979
Oh, man, I cannot contain

2435
04:12:04,459 --> 04:12:06,540
The pogs that are coming out of my mouth right now

2436
04:12:09,399 --> 04:12:12,780
See in six hours

2437
04:12:12,780 --> 04:12:14,780
When i'm not streaming

2438
04:12:16,379 --> 04:12:18,870
I'm probably lying down in my bed

2439
04:12:18,870 --> 04:12:21,510
I in fact probably an hour from now. I probably will be doing that as well

2440
04:12:22,489 --> 04:12:30,010
So i'm not gonna see you though. The stream will have been completely ended by then

2441
04:12:30,329 --> 04:12:32,329
For at least a few hours at least

2442
04:12:32,329 --> 04:12:38,379
Come on, I gotta get up there

2443
04:12:38,379 --> 04:12:45,180
Come on, get up there

2444
04:12:45,180 --> 04:12:46,459
Get up there

2445
04:12:46,459 --> 04:12:59,750
Oh wait, do a bed stream to erase the debt

2446
04:13:00,469 --> 04:13:03,030
I'm not gonna do a bed stream

2447
04:13:06,299 --> 04:13:08,299
How can you not like it? It's got candies

2448
04:13:08,459 --> 04:13:14,200
What would I do though? Like what do you want me to do for that?

2449
04:13:14,840 --> 04:13:17,209
Just lie down in bed

2450
04:13:21,530 --> 04:13:27,610
Sleep, I don't think you can do that. I maybe wait. Yeah, I can do that if I don't like give a notification out, right?

2451
04:13:29,860 --> 04:13:31,860
And you're not allowed to sleep on twitch

2452
04:13:31,860 --> 04:13:33,860
With uh as long as you don't

2453
04:13:33,860 --> 04:13:40,899
Something like that

2454
04:13:40,899 --> 04:13:43,139
You would play on the ipad until you get really sleepy

2455
04:13:43,860 --> 04:13:47,379
Oh, I love the thing. Yeah the slide best part

2456
04:13:51,049 --> 04:13:54,010
You watch somebody sleep on twitch. Yeah, but this is that that's like

2457
04:13:54,489 --> 04:13:57,530
Five and a half years ago or something before like all these rules were in place

2458
04:14:00,139 --> 04:14:05,180
Yeah, I told you that this dude was sleeping on stream and somebody was spamming this wicked loud piano

2459
04:14:05,659 --> 04:14:09,260
In his ears and he wasn't awake. It was like the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen in my life

2460
04:14:09,659 --> 04:14:11,819

2677
04:38:22,470 --> 04:38:24,150

2678
04:38:24,150 --> 04:38:39,110

04:39:13,290 --> 04:39:15,290
You fly and put a load of the ground

2684
04:39:19,049 --> 04:39:21,610
He's direct hitting the plane. Isn't that bad?

2685
04:39:39,319 --> 04:39:41,319
What the fuck is that?

2686
04:39:41,479 --> 04:39:57,270

2696
04:41:24,540 --> 04:41:28,139
Settle down and I didn't go very far, but I went real high

2697
04:41:30,090 --> 04:42:06,150
That has to account for something that breaks a vertical record. It's not bad. The angle's too high. Is that it hurdles? Oh fuck

2698
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:25,080

Oh, that's right. I could just hit the I could just hold turbo

2702
04:42:57,220 --> 04:42:59,779

04:45:00,759 --> 04:45:02,279

04:45:02,279 --> 04:45:12,779

2721
04:47:34,659 --> 04:47:40,740

2793
04:56:36,909 --> 04:56:47,470
And i'm playing this console that I purchased on stream, but it's super mario brothers, which is definitely not licensed by nintendo

2794
04:56:47,790 --> 04:57:02,000

05:18:39,680 --> 05:18:52,250
I guess I did higher jump. I kind of wanted to die

2948
05:18:53,790 --> 05:18:56,409
um, all right, that was

2949
05:18:56,889 --> 05:19:02,319
A game that I don't want to ever play again. I would play the final game on the list. That's true

2950
05:19:02,880 --> 05:19:12,700
Okay, the final game is baseball new and then b-wings and then i'll see you guys tomorrow

2951
05:19:18,330 --> 05:19:25,529
I just pitched the ball back to him. I don't know if it's me at the plate who's

2952
05:19:26,990 --> 05:19:48,919
Is me hitting? No, i'm pitching. Okay, so get it back to the pitcher. Why does he put on pajamas? Get it

2953
05:19:49,759 --> 05:19:51,759
Why would the pitcher go field that ball?

2954
05:19:51,919 --> 05:20:18,590
Did they they they wait till the ball is done before they start to field the ball?

2955
05:20:19,209 --> 05:20:25,659
I will never get an out. I cannot move

2994
05:25:02,830 --> 05:25:05,200

Oh my god my sides

2997
05:25:18,750 --> 05:25:32,830
It looks like it's probably a dodge. It's pretty fun. This is a real game. I would assume right?

2998
05:25:34,360 --> 05:25:35,639
Kind of has to be

05:25:35,639 --> 05:25:45,180
Oh my god, dude my sides

05:25:45,180 --> 05:25:54,400

05:25:55,040 --> 05:26:06,680
Um, it seems pretty good

3002
05:26:06,680 --> 05:26:16,080
Nice ship. Hey, thanks. Ooh, this is cool

3003
05:26:17,419 --> 05:26:21,500

05:26:30,409 --> 05:26:32,759

05:27:10,939 --> 05:27:12,700
A little shield. That's cool

3010
05:27:12,700 --> 05:27:15,319
Kind of annoying sound but it's all right

3011
05:27:15,319 --> 05:27:25,869
If I do play this again, i'm gonna plug the other controller and i'm gonna have to I might get like another controller for this somehow

3012
05:27:27,360 --> 05:27:30,880
It's two controllers, but I tried them both. They both have the same left issue

3013
05:27:31,759 --> 05:27:40,009
Hammer's pretty sick

3014
05:27:40,009 --> 05:27:42,009
Shield around you is actually pretty useful

05:27:43,639 --> 05:27:45,639
