1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,300
What's up? Didn't expect me today, did you?

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,699
Hey. Just like I can delay streams indefinitely.

3
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,260
I can also pull them back.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,940
That's exactly what we're doing.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,250
We'll stream tomorrow, but I think we can go over a few things.

6
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,250
Reverse delay, yeah.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,640
It happens like once a year.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Well, you're here for it!

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,280
You're here for it!

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,350
The one time every year that I, instead of pushing a stream out, I do it a day or two before.

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,920
And it's funny, because this is a mistake on my part.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,909
So I come in a free stream chat, and people are just kind of like,

13
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,909
Hey, what's up, man? What are you doing here?

14
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,219
I'm just like, what do you mean? Let's get ready!

15
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,219
Probably like 3.30.

16
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:20,060
I thought it was Tuesday.

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,060
And I'm just going to go by what I think in my head.

18
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
So I'm not just going to get here and be ready, sitting at the desk.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,560
It's like, OK, here we go.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
It's time to stream.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
And then, no, no, never mind.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I'm coming, but no, I'm here.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm ready.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
So we're streaming today.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,879
We also are going to play Such Art, which, I don't know, I saw this came out.

26
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,879
This Steel Rising, Dark Souls-like.

27
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,819
We can hear the game when you talk again.

28
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,819
What the fuck, man?

29
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,819
Why is it so hard to stream?

30
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,819
Why does it never...

31
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,819
Why do my settings get reversed every time I turn on my computer?

32
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,379
I'm being serious.

33
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,500
Why is it fixed?

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,129
Why do my settings reverse every time I turn my computer on?

35
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,750
What the fuck is this doing?

36
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,750
Oh, God, come on.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,490
OK.

38
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,490
Anyways.

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,490
Yeah. All right.

40
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Let's go over a few things.

41
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,110
Let's talk about the week ahead here because there's a few things we need to discuss.

42
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,110
Very important.

43
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,080
I think it's fixed.

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,319
Yeah.

45
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,319
All right. So here's the deal.

46
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,879
So what we're going to do this weekend.

47
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,879
Oh, my stop.

48
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,879
Hold on.

49
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,000
This weekend, we're going to do an Omega weekend.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,710
OK.

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm streaming today.

52
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,210
We'll go for about five to seven hours, depending on how long it takes, depending what we do.

53
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,960
But there's something that I have to do.

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,960
There's something that I've been kind of figuring out the last day or so.

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,520
It's why I didn't stream yesterday.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,580
I have to get a thousand fucking baseballs signed and shipped because there's a lot of them.

57
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:26,090
So I have to get that going once for me.

58
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,090
That's right.

59
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,629
You should do it on stream.

60
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,629
No, I don't want to do that.

61
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,629
That's weird.

62
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,629
That's weird to me.

63
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:37,629
I don't like that at all.

64
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:47,199
I want to just sit there with a YouTube playlist up for like two to like eight hour days back

65
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
to back.

66
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:54,319
Just put on, you know what I've been really into?

67
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,319
This chemist on YouTube.

68
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,319
I have no idea what the hell he's talking about.

69
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,319
But all his videos, they're like 30 plus minute long videos.

70
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,560
And it just talks about all this chemistry.

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Nile Red.

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Yeah, that's the one.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,560
So I just watch Nile Red and I just, here's the thing that happens when you watch a Nile

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Red video.

75
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,860
By the time you get to the end of the video and the experiment is over, I forgot the whole

76
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
video.

77
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,100
I don't even know what happened.

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,220
They're awesome though.

79
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
They are the best videos just to sit there with your mouth open and just go.

80
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Wow.

81
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,089
I'm learning.

82
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:40,689
I have no idea what I'm learning.

83
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:44,660
Stream that straight.

84
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Wait, stream watching Nile Red videos.

85
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,660
I don't know about that.

86
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,660
I'd rather you watch Nile Red videos on Nile Red's channel.

87
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,600
I mean, we could.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,029
All right.

89
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,029
But I want to do that while I'm signing baseballs.

90
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:04,810
Do you really want me to stream this?

91
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
I don't know.

92
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,810
I don't think so.

93
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,810
That's weird to me.

94
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,810
To me, that's like, I don't know.

95
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,810
That feels like an egomaniac stream.

96
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,810
I don't know why it just does.

97
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,810
That feels kind of like an egomaniac thing.

98
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,810
Oh, hey, what's up guys?

99
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,810
Signing baseballs.

100
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,810
Yeah.

101
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,810
I'm going to sign this one too.

102
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,810
Oh, give me that one.

103
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,810
Yeah.

104
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,810
I'm going to sign that one.

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,180
That's my name on it, by the way.

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,079
I don't know.

107
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,079
Maybe.

108
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,949
I will give you a hard maybe on that one, but I do.

109
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:35,949
I have to get that sorted.

110
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:36,949
I got to get shipments.

111
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,949
I got to get, it's a thousand baseballs.

112
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:39,949
It's a lot of material.

113
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:40,949
It's a ton to work with.

114
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,949
So my plan is this.

115
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:50,670
I'm going to stream today and then unless I decide to do an egomaniac megalomania stream,

116
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:58,939
the next time you see me after tonight will be for the Omega weekend on Friday, Saturday

117
00:05:58,939 --> 00:05:59,939
and Sunday.

118
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,939
We're going to do three days in a row.

119
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,939
I know I've been kind of bouncing around a lot lately.

120
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,939
I've been, you know, it's been like three days, no stream, four days, five days, no

121
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:07,939
stream.

122
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,939
We're going to do an Omega weekend this weekend.

123
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,180
So get your recommendations in to the discord channel because that's going to build, it's

124
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,180
going to be a doozy of three days in a row.

125
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,259
I promise this is not going to be like a, well, this streams like four hours in a 16

126
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,259
minutes.

127
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,689
No, we're going to do three Omega streams in a row.

128
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:30,689
We're doing an Omega weekend and I'm going to laugh my ass off if I get like a headache

129
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,689
on Friday afternoon.

130
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,379
But that's the plan.

131
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:37,000
Guys, we can't do the Omega weekend.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I got to, I need a nap.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,300
I won't.

134
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,459
Don't burn out.

135
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,459
No, I've, I've been taking a lot of time.

136
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:47,459
So don't worry.

137
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,459
I'll be okay.

138
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,459
It'll be fun.

139
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,459
We'll get a bunch of stuff to do.

140
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:57,930
You're going to call into sick for work.

141
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,829
No, I'm not going to.

142
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,829
I promise we'll do a bunch of stuff.

143
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:04,829
We'll play like a 10 different games.

144
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:05,829
We'll jump around.

145
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,829
We'll be crazy.

146
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:12,779
But today we're going to play this dark soul.

147
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,779
I stopped saying that because I feel like companies hate to hear that.

148
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,779
Hey guys, we're going to play this thing.

149
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,779
And the only thing that I'm going to tell you is dark souls is awesome.

150
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,959
Okay.

151
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,959
I'm sure that it's like, yeah.

152
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,740
I do.

153
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Dark souls is an awesome game.

154
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,550
Let's play this one called steel rising.

155
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,550
I have no idea.

156
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,370
We're just going to, we're going to give it a try.

157
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,370
You guys ready?

158
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,740
Change the title.

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:44,560
I like that title because everybody calls everything like a souls, ask souls, light,

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:57,980
souls, like souls, ask souls, light, like I think my title is fine.

161
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,980
I should just start calling this stream a rogue light stream because it turns off and

162
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
we start over again with like a new game.

163
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Another stream later.

164
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,730
It's kind of like a rogue.

165
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,730
Like, you know, we start over on a different, a different game.

166
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,800
Each stream.

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
All right.

168
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,230
Let me get this.

169
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,839
I think unplugged here.

170
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,839
I hope this is good.

171
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,360
All right.

172
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Can you guys, you guys can't see this is way too loud for me.

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
It probably won't be too loud for you though.

174
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
And I can confirm.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,730
Yes.

176
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,480
We've confirmed it.

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,419
I've confirmed it with you.

178
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,419
We are with a new camera angle.

179
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,690
I have moved it to where I want it permanently.

180
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,690
Do you understand where this is now?

181
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,690
This is a perfect gang.

182
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,500
Perfect angle.

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Perfect lighting.

184
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,580
What do you think?

185
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,100
This is better.

186
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
Right?

187
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
You're right there.

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,100
You're literally right there.

189
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Exactly where I wanted you.

190
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,649
It's too orange.

191
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,649
That's, that's my face.

192
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,580
All right.

193
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,860
You guys ready for this?

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I'm ready.

195
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,860
I'm ready.

196
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
This is called Steel Rising.

197
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,100
Why did I laugh?

198
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Oh, God damn it.

199
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
I can't.

200
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I just, I'm why am I even live?

201
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,690
Okay.

202
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,690
And why is this funny?

203
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,690
This isn't funny.

204
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,860
Nothing that I'm doing is funny.

205
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860
I don't understand.

206
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Why am I laughing at this?

207
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
What the fuck is going on?

208
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,860
What's assist mode?

210
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,220
Okay.

211
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
So this makes it easier.

212
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,799
Okay.

213
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,799
Well, I don't, I don't, I don't, I'm not going to need that for now.

214
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,799
Maybe I'll need it later.

215
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,799
We'll see.

216
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,000
All right.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Here comes the opening cut scene.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Everybody's quiet.

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,779
Where's Otto?

220
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:00,779
I'll show him.

221
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:01,779
I told you later.

222
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:16,639
Checkmate.

223
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,820
You know, actually, I think I'm in no mood for games right now.

224
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,580
How much longer are we to be kept here?

225
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,580
We just simply watch as Paris burns from afar.

226
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,009
The rabble of rioting.

227
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,379
This is the price to be paid for spoiling the masses.

228
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,379
Why are they playing chess?

229
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,679
The king sent us here long before the city went up in flames.

230
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,240
He knew what was about to transpire.

231
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
If you're a noble, do you have to know chess?

232
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
What if you don't?

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Does that annoy the other nobles?

234
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
True.

235
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,240
He can be misguided and somewhat short tempered at times, but he's no Nero.

236
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Then why have we been given no news for so long?

237
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,210
Place en four, Gabrielle.

238
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,210
The children.

239
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,149
They'll soon be out of harm's way.

240
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:08,149
I am most certain of it.

241
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:11,149
Monsieur Clary will take good care of them.

242
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,149
For now, at least, we are safe.

243
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,149
Louder?

244
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,149
Safe.

245
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:16,149
Vremont?

246
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,330
Where are the Shadow Guards?

247
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,330
We are still protected.

248
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,330
The king just preferred to use a different sort of guard.

249
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,330
R1.

250
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,330
R1.

251
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,330
R1.

252
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,330
R1.

253
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,740
R1.

254
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Odds?

255
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
Or jailers?

256
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Leave this room, Gabrielle.

257
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
The king.

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,970
He has lost his mind to grief.

259
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,460
First our darling, Sophie.

260
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
Then our beloved son.

261
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,830
My poor sweet angel.

262
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,830
They didn't let me say goodbye.

263
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,070
What character am I?

264
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,070
I wasn't even allowed to see him.

265
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,019
Serephar.

266
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,019
Something inside me is crying out.

267
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:49,019
Telling me he's still of this world at times.

268
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,580
I think I hear him calling to me.

269
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
I'm so afraid.

270
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
What do you fear, my dear?

271
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
I'm so afraid.

272
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm so afraid.

273
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,070
I'm so afraid.

274
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,070
I'm so afraid.

275
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,070
I'm so afraid.

276
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,070
I'm so afraid.

277
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,070
I'm so afraid.

278
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm so afraid.

279
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,070
I'm so afraid.

280
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,070
I'm so afraid.

281
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,070
I'm so afraid.

282
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,070
I'm so afraid.

283
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,070
I'm so afraid.

284
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,070
I'm so afraid.

285
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,070
I'm so afraid.

286
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,070
I'm so afraid.

287
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,070
I'm so afraid.

288
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,070
I'm so afraid.

289
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,460
I'm so afraid.

290
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
I'm so afraid.

291
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,460
What do you fear, my queen?

292
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
Everything, everything horrifies me.

293
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,320
The king's wrath, his army of indefatigable automats that Monsieur de Vaucossot has built

294
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,220
for him, the charlatans.

295
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
You're the hair.

296
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Who are now more powerful, more modest.

297
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,059
Did you mean to say heir or hair?

298
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,059
Like her hair?

299
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,059
What happened to my son?

300
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,399
What will happen to the children that God has deigned to leave in my care?

301
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,440
I won't let any harm come to them.

302
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Did you say heir?

303
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,659

304
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:37,659

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,500
was something else I might want to do to advanced video if it's in here I'm gonna

354
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:24,349
be really happy okay that's fine that's fine that's fine ray tracing mm-hmm I

355
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:43,819
don't see it wait game subtitles camera effects no all right let's go oh you can

356
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:50,519
grab try explore is it get a full letter grade we'll find out in a second is

357
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,869
there sprint I don't think this is sprint it might be it's a very pretty

358
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:01,529
game that matters to anybody here all right each weapon has an attacking or

359
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:07,190
deep special move for the okay so it's like a weapon art I know it's not yeah

360
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:21,960
whatever what did that do oh it's just a block okay by the way yes it did get

361
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,799
rid of the screen shake I believe so that's a full letter grid all right hold

362
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:34,329
on wait you can overheat when a just runs out of endurance her gears overheat

363
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:38,609
and she can no longer perform the following actions attack jump dodge or

364
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:46,799
sprint what that's not good when you overheated you can trigger rapid

365
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,319
cooling which can instantly restore an amount of endurance depending on your

366
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,240
timing however this inflicts a certain amount of frost damage as shown in the

367
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,130
following gauge wait did he play this before no that's the surge is one of my

368
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,500
least favorite games of all time using it too soon after okay so I gotta be

369
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:20,950
careful so over let me try this oops so if I overheat okay overheated you have

370
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:25,980
to do it immediately all right that's kind of insane I'm kidding that that

371
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:31,880
game is fine I just didn't like it I know that game is it was very cool I

372
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,200
didn't like it whatever do I really I don't need to explain myself I didn't

373
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:48,519
like it I didn't like it so get out of here leave me alone I wonder what is

374
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,319
there there are no iframes wait are there iframes let's try let's test no

375
00:21:53,319 --> 00:22:06,359
there isn't wait let's try it okay maybe there is I don't have any heels left

376
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:18,170
now the third you know it was the surge to that I never played the surge one I

377
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,289
actually enjoyed up at the first hour then I backtracked a statement that I

378
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:26,289
made in front of about 12,000 people to make sure that nobody hates me for

379
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:30,849
having a video game that I don't like or something so I backtracked and I you

380
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,529
know honestly like if you like what you like who cares enjoy what you enjoy

381
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,970
don't let some dickhead like me tell you that you can't like something because I

382
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,650
didn't that's stupid it's a dumb mindset and you should nobody should have it

383
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:57,710
I'm gonna die H's light weapons are able to inflict immobilization damages shown

384
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,329
in the immobilization gauge and the gauges build the enemy is temporarily

385
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:06,950
immobilized leaving them open to a critical hit okay so immobilization

386
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:21,180
damage did it work that for it oh okay cool ignore the fact that you're

387
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:27,440
insulting no that clip that was cycling around was a joke and you clipping it

388
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,880
out of context I said it and it was a it was a comedic reference it was a joke I

389
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,640
didn't actually mean it right afterwards I go no no I'm just kidding I need to

390
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:51,150
heal is there oh there is a sprint okay cool nice PR Andy no I genuinely look if

391
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,990
you like stuff who cares if I don't if we got the people don't like it do you

392
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:01,700
like it who cares enjoy it I like the venom movie you know throw

393
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:09,049
fucking eggs at me all right well that obviously can't go in there so I'm

394
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:33,309
almost dead though what happens when I die cool rusty key wait secrets what

395
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:42,890
did this game come out essence of spirit I'm livid that you don't share my

396
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:53,190
opinion you know four days ago oh shit I'm I'm right on time I'm never like

397
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:59,079
I'm never on time for this I never play a new game when it comes out I feel kind

398
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:17,259
of accomplished in some way what if I get heels are there crabs in the game

399
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,250
who knows we'll find out I got I'm the first boss is definitely gonna be okay

400
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:37,269
break stuff ordinary oil but wait hold on is this a heel okay it's a it's a

401
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:53,920
hot oh this is a bonfire stop saying that okay activating a vestal creates a

402
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,960
checkpoint where eight you know why I'm playing this because I saw the trailer

403
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,470
trailer for um lies of P and I was like oh I want to play like a souls game

404
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:21,809
again I knew it well whatever what's lies of P no it's I'm not saying it

405
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:27,599
wrong right it's the fucking Pinocchio game it's the Pinocchio souls like you

406
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:38,680
understand what I just said go look it up that's so weird to say okay upgrade

407
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,839
attributes by spending so that's essence okay so that's just like souls upgrade

408
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:50,759
equipment by spending materials and obtain equipment by spending essence so

409
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:57,900
wait you there's no you have to buy all the stuff you want to find this is a

410
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:21,670
bonfire that's cool okay upgrades module slots requires three keys weapons all

411
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:31,289
right I need 1,500 essence to upgrade this and a bronze ingot okay so all the

412
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:34,049
upgrades are literally on the same screen which is that's that's good that's

413
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:40,940
cool all right one power one agility what am I what do I want probably

414
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:52,049
agility right agility or power how do I increase damage power I don't have

415
00:27:52,130 --> 00:28:01,880
souls to do this he hates it I do this feels like a YouTube somehow the YouTube

416
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,980
video kind of like a director's commentary why this is not a director's

417
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:18,940
commentary what's happening it's the camera angle do I do I have to buy

418
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:27,700
heels it's the camera angle this is a beautiful angle it's perfect I'm right

419
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,220
in frame it's got my whole head and body it's direct it's not off to the side

420
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:38,559
what this is director commentary Andy all right we're moving on we're moving on

421
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:52,420
try buy these is a stupid well maybe it was dumb but I bought four heels oh cool

422
00:28:52,420 --> 00:29:01,019
any hats I'm interested I'm actually interested that seems like a pretty easy

423
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:06,660
well not easy the wrong word it seems like a pretty it's a good system to put

424
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,500
everything in the same place so I don't have to like go to this bonfire to find

425
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,700
this NPC in the woods that'll teach me how to do a spell right I know that's

426
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,380
cool but I do I do appreciate the like the complete package in the same spot

427
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,460
and I'm a huge fan of the souls games huge fan you all know that especially

428
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:35,279
Elden Ring but I do appreciate that there did I just can I sneak there's a

429
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:42,369
lot of staggering this game too seems like oh okay so I do have a heal that

430
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:47,579
regenerates it's good to know hi where's the where's the tutorial boss

431
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:57,680
let's go where are you I'm ready for it let's go this way wait did I come from

432
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:14,240
this way oh shit I'm out of juice oh fuck I don't like that all right we're

433
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,140
good I'm not used to paying attention to that mm-hmm I need I need deadly boss

434
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,819
mods installed do you know I'm saying it needs to scream at me that I'm getting

435
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:40,000
close how much is this heal to the hole right I actually need something like

436
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:54,019
DBM feels like a zoom call well whatever what the hell is that wait a minute you

437
00:30:54,019 --> 00:31:05,339
need a tool to break this no stop I can't jump that the boss gets lock on to

438
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:10,730
a targeted approach slowly ooh okay that's helpful what is considered

439
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:19,240
that was pretty cool that was pretty cool I have somebody saying this it

440
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:33,799
seriously feels like a zoom call this is a fake reaction it's not you guys need

441
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:56,319
to relax I'm not superimposed on top of the video no joke I've missed it the

442
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:06,089
controller parasocial Andy's zoom call this is like a council meeting I'm so

443
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:19,420
confused I'm just gonna play oh chat raid one ooh wait you just obtained a

444
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,140
new module you can almost pick my nose on camera you can assign it to a module

445
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:31,339
slot of the same level from the module menu yeah what's this do increases

446
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:38,779
health this is oh this is rapid cooling I'm gonna put the health one in like I

447
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:47,529
could use it this is definitely gonna be something that drops here in no way

448
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:58,849
right this is definitely like tutorial bosses place I guess not maybe it is

449
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:18,240
right here elusory walls wasn't supposed to go on a boat this risk art

450
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,400
killed by the automats that replaced them that's kind of an e3 walk what I

451
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,720
just did but you know what I mean all right um this is kind of crazy what's

452
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:37,819
going on here captain degros governor deafrey confirms that no command was

453
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:43,500
given to replace your company with a detachment of automats I therefore urge

454
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,380
you until further notice to keep your distance from these machines and to

455
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,140
inform me of any signs of hostility do not engage unless her majesty the Queen

456
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:58,369
is in danger reinforcements are on route hurdle the back man second in

457
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:11,019
command oh whatever defeat the unstable automat to activate what I can't even

458
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:18,030
touch the bonfire until I kill the boss here oh let's go first try Andy I'm so

459
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:37,320
upset Andy all right let's go let's go first try check it out music all I have

460
00:34:37,320 --> 00:35:00,760
is hot oh that's bad okay wait I'm just resetting it

461
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:36,429
shit what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing don't overheat

462
00:35:36,429 --> 00:36:22,579
don't overheat no I overheat it first try yeah it was just a story boss come

463
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:38,760
on module key is this a surge like game you've just obtained a module key Aegis

464
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,900
has several slots for modules that augment her stats and after the

465
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:51,380
behavior of reading comprehension let me try that again Aegis has several slots

466
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,980
for modules that augment her stats and alter the behavior of certain mechanics

467
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:00,690
the slots of levels that allow Aegis to fit increasingly powerful modules to

468
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,210
unlock a slot with the module key you just obtained go to the upgrades menu at

469
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:10,420
the Vestal note you can equip modules at any given time from Aegis I'm not

470
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:18,630
comprehending this hold on let me read without talking okay so I can upgrade my

471
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:27,940
modules that was kind of fun that felt that felt pretty that felt clean and

472
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:42,280
responsive that felt pretty responsive that was fun I enjoyed that let me look

473
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:55,920
at this okay oh I get it so I can have two modules now what does this get me

474
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:04,760
though if I do three keys here should I just do the other one you so higher I

475
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:19,059
know level 2 slot um I'll just do let's just go with this so I can um have two

476
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:27,119
modules at the same time it makes sense right how many souls do I have oh shit

477
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,570
I can upgrade something what should I do engineering what does it do I'll give

478
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:42,650
no help menu which in multiplier loot multiplier and armor this is health I'm

479
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,769
assuming and during oh no it's just it's stamina and critical hit multiplier

480
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:57,380
durability is health and balance power resides but then believe it resides

481
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:19,539
it's a trick shadow on the wall I don't know how people are actors I would get

482
00:39:19,539 --> 00:39:30,139
halfway through a line like that and be like Jesus you are an actor I think I'm

483
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:38,010
gonna stay with probably this or durability you're camera shy I'm not

484
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,610
camera shy actually I probably I'd probably be a pretty good dramatic

485
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:52,519
actor you did have a voice acting gig for that phone game I did you're right I

486
00:39:52,519 --> 00:40:01,389
think I think I could be a pretty good actor if I really wanted to um I don't

487
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:03,989
know I I don't want to ruin the character so it's just tell me if

488
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:07,789
somebody helped me should I just do durability I feel like that's safe I

489
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:22,019
mean I do act on the big event streams right are you come sometimes you know

490
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:29,460
like I get into character I'm gonna do health because you know whatever that's

491
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:46,909
gonna be healthier okay cool theater kid that's fine all right so yeah now I can

492
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:51,539
put these both in so what does this do slightly reduces the internal damage

493
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:54,179
caused by rapid cooling well it's good just to have them both I'm sure I'll

494
00:40:54,179 --> 00:41:00,210
find more so this system I'm assuming is probably gonna be like Hollow Knight

495
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:22,210
right it's kind of what it looks like it might be okay cool so now what what is

496
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:34,900
the alchemy capsule thing what does this do quest items no it's materials no what

497
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:43,840
is it I keep picking it up where is it it's not a quest item and it's not

498
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,679
materials it's not in my access belt where what is it what is it it's just

499
00:41:48,679 --> 00:42:08,570
souls it is please eat a booger I keep picking it up the multi versus banner is

500
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:17,900
still there no it's not I took it off didn't I it shouldn't be there is it

501
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:43,170

508
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:35,659
think I'm gonna be sick shit what happened I turned multi versus banner

509
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:44,579
and my game freaked out why is that such a stupid okay um I think I have to reset

510
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:59,889
the whole game give me one sec restart the whole game I'm interested I'm I'm

511
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:20,820
still here trust me when I would have stopped by now I would have okay let's

512
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:37,750
try it again Nvidia GeForce RTX does anybody actually turn that on I have a

513
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:43,429
3090 and I have I don't think I've ever used it I think we turned it on for one

514
00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:49,500
minute in Resident Evil 8 I don't know I just to me it's just like oh hey RTX is

515
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:55,070
cool it might like fuck up the whole game though every time I've ever used it

516
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:13,719
it just slows everything down the chest over here that hurt why is this head

517
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:28,500
shaped like Stewie Griffin what I have a musket how do I use it wait hold on I

518
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:39,630
can wait a minute why didn't I do this alchemy damage flame frost and

519
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,739
fulmination when she uses alchemy capsules for each attack alchemical

520
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,380
damage fills a gauge which when full triggers an affliction which lasts and

521
00:46:50,380 --> 00:47:09,219
okay ignite frost full metal alchemist is electrocution so should I have 36

522
00:47:09,219 --> 00:47:21,539
bullets how many bullets do I have 34 does this refill do I have infinite no

523
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:36,590
I only have 34 okay don't waste it let's try it though what's the range on it

524
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:48,639
that's fucking way I've rented a money that's actually pretty cool all right

525
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:56,000
that's cool so you just this is ammo you just pick it up you wasted all your ammo

526
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,250
I didn't I needed to see how it worked before I fought anything a lantern new

527
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:14,059
zone ran it caught what does this cobblestone do okay there is a jump

528
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:25,559
attack there's a hover attack too I do like the fact that the dodge when you

529
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:30,539
dodge an attack you go around them and not just to the side I do enjoy I enjoy

530
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:48,800
it what happened to my eyebrows what do you mean ooh here flame resistance down

531
00:48:48,800 --> 00:49:01,889
but everything else up let's put it on I thought this hit pog shoes okay

532
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:12,800
endurance up cool all right let's go this is blocked oh yeah shortcut I think

533
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:55,630
maybe new enemy type flame well item I thought I dodged it I think the i-frames

534
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:12,420
are small I don't think they're very big that's fun excuse me what's with the

535
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:25,590
i-frames that's cuz I alt tab that's annoying I alt tab nice hairline angle I

536
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:44,599
think it looks fine that's very generous the backstab range on that was I was a

537
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:57,760
hundred feet away you're dodging into where they attack I know that like when

538
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,000
you first came to this channel you probably didn't see it but it says no

539
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:15,360
back seating I got a compass oh I can set a waypoint nemesis claws excuse me

540
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:26,619
already got a new weapon all right hold on this is the scales better with agility

541
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:33,650
52 this is what about hold on wait is impact all right this is worse but

542
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,610
counter it's any parry that is time just right reverses the effects of the

543
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:46,460
enemy's attack and deals physical damage how are they they cool like

544
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:54,750
scarecrow hands so that's a parry I wonder how hard it is to do I try it I

545
00:51:54,750 --> 00:52:08,199
try for a minute somebody else can somebody else to read that I didn't mean

546
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:14,650
to press that button there would do you're balding I'm almost 40 don't worry

547
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:22,500
and I know wish you're gonna have you wish you have this here when you're 37

548
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,320
you will wish that you had this fucking hairline when you're almost 40 like me

549
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:43,030
how do I get up there I can definitely get up there there's a chest up there

550
00:52:43,030 --> 00:53:02,230
how do I get up here it's like an elevator or something maybe the rope I

551
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:19,510
don't think there's a grab shit shoot the gun and I re-aim the gun I don't

552
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:28,920
think I can get up there I know maybe later wait shit there's a chest up there

553
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:48,510
the other rope I don't know if I can get up there I'm just waiting to say the

554
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:54,449
solution you know being a streamer is great for a few reasons it has you know

555
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:59,250
has its pros and cons right during a broadcast but it it's great to be able

556
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:07,579
to just kind of go like this and then go oh what if I uh what if I attack the

557
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:11,219
ropes and then everyone's like oh he figured it out pog that's the best part

558
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:14,539
about being a streamer is you just don't know when I just look at chat and read

559
00:54:14,539 --> 00:54:19,739
the answer and that's what we all do it everybody does it if you're a streamer

560
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:24,539
and you say you don't do that come on Gwen it's it's very subtle it's like the

561
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:35,599
where do I fucking go guys oh you know what I could try I could try the jumping

562
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:42,670
twice here all right well I'm just leaving that should not have hurt game

563
00:54:42,670 --> 00:55:02,139
got a lower grade for that why one full letter grade oh this is it I just got

564
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:14,820
sucked into the game can you fast travel see the bald spot good I don't have a

565
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:26,429
bald spot all right what about this boutique wait I can just buy this stuff

566
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:38,250
all right the letter grade came back so I own the compass oh I can sell all

567
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:48,559
right there's anything can I sell this stuff you look at so I this is just the

568
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,920
crunchies from those other games that we won't we will not compare it to I can

569
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:12,800
level up again oh I can just use it from here that work oh okay I guess it worked

570
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:28,010
all right so agility yeah I think that makes sense right I'm weapon that scales

571
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:38,329
with agility most of my stuff is scaling with agility all right that was cool so

572
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:48,949
from here I'm trying to figure out what to go from here I gotta check for secret

573
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:51,630
areas there's probably a secret area behind this rock like that I might that

574
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:56,929
I'm doing on my own and thinking of yeah like why like I feel like I'm trying to

575
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:59,849
use my knowledge of the game and everything that there's a secret behind

576
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:05,789
the rock and it's like a rare weapon it might be I don't know it's possible I'm

577
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:21,420
pretty I have a lot of game knowledge so ordinary vile all right let's get

578
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:34,480
another boss I'm using the new weapons all right how do I get them to spin

579
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:44,789
didn't they go last time how do I get how do I do that didn't they spin am I

580
00:57:44,789 --> 00:58:16,940
out of my mind they spun there it is okay it's the next one I actually like I

581
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:31,119
kind of like the cause I didn't get anything oh what all right oh I got a

582
00:58:31,119 --> 00:59:05,909
key they put you in a box with a camera this time new enemy type quiet you can

583
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:17,639
tell that he's not playing the game you know I've thought of before I thought of

584
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,989
hiring somebody that was a true video gamer right and just have them off to

585
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:28,510
the side while I sit there and we have we have a controller setup where they're

586
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:33,440
both the controllers are player one you know I mean so we have two controllers

587
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,309
both are player one it's not player one and player two so they would have a

588
00:59:37,309 --> 00:59:40,530
controller here and I would have the same controller and they'd be doing

589
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:44,489
insane and I can whenever I want just take over and and and just start

590
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:47,289
playing and hold up the controller and be like the fuck are you talking about

591
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:51,409
I'm literally doing it and move on my own show me moving with the controller

592
00:59:51,409 --> 00:59:54,519
and everything you would absolutely fall for it because why would you ever think

593
00:59:54,519 --> 01:00:04,860
it wasn't happening destiny to PvP I'll say it again my fair part of that whole

594
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:15,300
scream was Aaron Aaron I think I think you can actually hear me laugh off like

595
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:26,159
camera well not off camera but in the call Aaron Aaron it's too good it's

596
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:47,619
perfect house oh the R2 is actually really good on that I like the R2 make

597
01:00:47,619 --> 01:01:15,960
on house I don't want to get to kill if you could be any dinosaur what would you

598
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:23,300
want to be pterodactyl they're the only ones who truly survived because they

599
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:29,159
turned into birds this'll we're getting weapons every five seconds here really

600
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:49,429
that's another weapon falchion and saber see affinity let me try these are cool

601
01:01:49,429 --> 01:02:00,230
what's the special I was you why would you use a different weapon is there a

602
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:13,880
reason to use a different item how much more damage does this do 56 this has

603
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:21,039
yeah he's the he's a better I'll use him for a little while it overheats really

604
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:30,239
quickly I feel like the move kit is way better I think laws they're okay oh yeah

605
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:35,079
I'd be a pterodactyl because I essentially every modern dinosaur is a

606
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:41,800
pterodactyl and when my money modern dinosaur I mean birds and alligators

607
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,769
survive too I mean they're fucking based you know what I mean like of course

608
01:02:45,769 --> 01:03:08,329
they're gonna live catalyst you have enough materials to upgrade the brett

609
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:13,130
open the upgrades menu at a vestal and use Lavo you see our catalysts to

610
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:17,769
increase the number of doses okay so this is like a s to splash all right

611
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:29,400
that's good I do everything over here did I see

612
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:45,719
everything it's this we need a tool to break this oh oh I do no I don't

613
01:03:45,719 --> 01:04:21,989
got seen that boats gonna take you to Paris uh you sure how do I get back

614
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:28,409
here unstable lightning ram all right how do I get back here actually don't

615
01:04:28,409 --> 01:05:16,099
remember my god get absolutely fucking decimated get fucking decimated this

616
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:42,320
guy fucking easy I win do I just have like the perfect build for that that

617
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:52,480
was not hard that guy was very very much chump that guy I was a test that's the

618
01:05:52,480 --> 01:06:02,119
first time they've ever used this thing it's gonna cut to like the doctor

619
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:06,820
robotic level of mad scientist over here in some ditch that's hiding with a

620
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,699
remote control being like blasted I can't believe my creation was killed so

621
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:22,139
easily that's how that's that kind of the level of how bad that was hey I'll

622
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:26,949
take it I'm happy the first guy was actually pretty hard the first guy was

623
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:29,929
pretty challenging although I did kind of cheese that so is that really fair

624
01:06:29,929 --> 01:06:35,679
for me to say that this boat will take me to Paris make sure I can't do

625
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:40,820
anything else I cheese the absolute hell what difficulty is it it's the whatever

626
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:53,539
the regular one I cheese that app 100% you're going to meet your compact

627
01:06:53,539 --> 01:07:25,440
ancestor on France I'm not French on France wait what is this the do it

628
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:37,139
territory one of the mods is trying to gaslight me but though pterosaurs lived

629
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:41,860
among dinosaurs and certainly looked like dinosaurs to the untrained eye the

630
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:52,710
two groups are not the same okay pterodactyls weren't dinosaurs they were

631
01:07:52,710 --> 01:08:05,190
another species hold on wait it was Paris across the lake that's not where I

632
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:11,280
came from right is that where I came from that doesn't make any sense they

633
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:18,220
wouldn't know right I had to go down a hole this uh-huh no I was gonna say you

634
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,859
could have you could have shot my head of a cannon over here in the beginning

635
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:47,060
of the game I gotta find a vest a vest you'll not a bonfire I don't lose all

636
01:08:47,060 --> 01:09:03,420
those souls right okay what all right I think you went down the river Cian that

637
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:09,729
goes right through the middle of Paris what where am I I don't even know never

638
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:34,170
mind he is playing yeah I climb this oh my god you ruined my moment I actually

639
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:41,579
I'm kind of scared because I where's the I need a safe point this one there but

640
01:09:41,579 --> 01:10:06,000
chest no frost grenade cool I like this area cool I can probably level up a

641
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:24,859
couple of times oh no you can't go through the gate right how come you can

642
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:31,579
go through the gate but I can't all right well there's the bonfire yes

643
01:10:31,579 --> 01:10:44,100
whatever it is best still can you do something funny my mom is watching no

644
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:58,109
go do your homework about I think it's just agility and durability if I can do

645
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:22,289
both I can crush some crunchies okay is that enough other durability he's 24

646
01:11:22,289 --> 01:11:44,500
I'm gonna hold on to the key you don't know that does the price go up every

647
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,260
time or down every time wait is that how many oh I have 218 of these why am I

648
01:11:48,260 --> 01:12:04,680
buying them okay let's uh stretch out a little a little bit of balm what's the

649
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:12,449
best salad recipe to learn for a recent grad depends on what you like red

650
01:12:12,449 --> 01:12:21,529
cabbage with Caesar salad I usually don't like Caesar salad to me is just

651
01:12:21,529 --> 01:12:25,989
is not is not a food do I feel is it weird for me to say that I don't feel I

652
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:29,989
feel like Caesar salad is not a rough food it's not a real food it's like

653
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:35,189
shredded lettuce croutons and like fucking dressing I genuinely don't find

654
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:53,039
to be a real food what about chicken well hold on you didn't say chicken

655
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:59,279
Caesar salad we're talking about just Caesar salad chicken Caesar salad

656
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:25,340
changes everything is this free spot I didn't even ask this question does this

657
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:46,899
respawn enemies I don't think it does okay it does okay what was I saying yeah

658
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:53,100
okay so I Caesar salad to me is well the new listen the nutritional content of

659
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:59,899
just regular lettuce is really not that high the nutritional content of just

660
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:04,260
chunks of bread just croutons is really not that high so if you're eating a

661
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:09,060
Caesar salad lunch you're not really getting very much it's just kind of

662
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:16,140
nothing a little side of a Caesar salad that's fine but if it's like oh yeah

663
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:18,420
I'll take a Caesar salad you're not really getting a whole lot of nutritional

664
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:24,140
value is not but it tastes good you name me a bunch of other things that tastes

665
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:36,600
good too that much better for you can I get up there lettuce has vitamins okay

666
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:45,850
lettuce has the vitamins I don't think lettuce has that many vitamins it

667
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:53,350
depends what kind of lettuce you're talking about spinach yeah you didn't

668
01:14:53,350 --> 01:15:00,090
say spinach was you said lettuce I love spinach spinach is one of my favorite

669
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:05,170
foods spinach is one of the best things ever what am I good how do I get out of

670
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:50,079
here how do I get out of here oh okay water flask yeah that's cool you know I

671
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:57,819
think the problem with salads are or is the problem with a salad for me is when

672
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:03,060
I'm hungry I don't it's not like oh I'm hungry I can't wait to eat salad I wish

673
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:08,050
salad was more substantial and I know that you can make salad more substantial

674
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:11,729
right but eventually you get to a point where there's so much shit in the salad

675
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:35,569
that it's kind of just like I'm a mess oh god come on what the oh my goodness

676
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:44,300
that was a long cool down romaine is all right right remains good salad toppers

677
01:16:44,300 --> 01:17:00,789
all right well let me check this way that's a Boston take maybe it is because

678
01:17:00,789 --> 01:17:05,069
on the East Coast and this is completely different on than it is here in Vegas

679
01:17:05,069 --> 01:17:12,619
and on the West Coast I've found I was spoiled rotten with some of the on the

680
01:17:12,619 --> 01:17:16,659
East Coast just has some of the best pizza the best sub shops the best

681
01:17:16,659 --> 01:17:21,100
fucking sandwich places oh you want it you want like a big sub you're the best

682
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:29,039
in the world is on the East Coast Boston New York Philadelphia I mean I was

683
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,960
spoiled rotten so eating like a big steak and cheese with my grilled onions

684
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:49,010
on it I don't want to eat the salad with pine nuts like what happened I'm so

685
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:56,069
jealous I miss it all the time I really do going back to the East Coast going

686
01:17:56,069 --> 01:18:03,979
back to Boston getting pizza from there just hits so different so different a

687
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:16,859
good nice thin crust just right out of the oven oh my god it's not the same not

688
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:22,750
here not at all there's decent pizza places around here but I wouldn't call

689
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:33,069
them good hold on I gotta be quiet this is kind of a hard pull I won't do it

690
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:51,500
all right we're good the East Coast is terrible for stargazing I'd rather a

691
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:57,039
steak and cheese sub than stargazing okay on my tier list of location based

692
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:03,920
things stargazing is way below like a Philly cheese steak it just it just is

693
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:22,750
but I love Vegas I love it out here so while I lose a lot of my favorite local

694
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:28,390
awesome sub shops and pizza places I gained Las Vegas which is man there's a

695
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:37,699
whole lot more to do there's a whole lot more going on out here I gotta put some

750
01:30:53,939 --> 01:30:59,850
don't think I could even selected hard I don't think that was an option I just

751
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:29,170
played on there whatever the regular mode is I'm gonna sneeze yes shortcut

752
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:34,529
there's no pop there's no pause oh there is a positive nevermind it's not like

753
01:31:34,529 --> 01:31:52,029
the Voldemort game that we can't say there we go should I do I don't know I

754
01:31:52,029 --> 01:31:54,750
feel like the gun is amazing it's actually incredible and I should have

755
01:31:54,750 --> 01:32:06,270
started with it show Otto I will just not yet no I'm playing this game I don't

756
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:12,619
think it's power ever engineering engineering is what like a luck stat in

757
01:32:12,619 --> 01:32:22,819
this game how come you're changing your camera angles every stream do you have

758
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:44,390
ass acne you've never seen a camera from back there no you when that's never

759
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:52,060
happened maybe a point in there yeah I feel like it's probably a good idea this

760
01:32:52,060 --> 01:33:03,460
is like stamina right yeah I haven't have to do it again all right so how

761
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:08,020
does this scale wait a second hold on that's a that's a weapon I thought that

762
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:14,210
was a module so I say whatever you want about this game go ahead and say it but

763
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:27,770
this is the fifth weapon in an hour in ten minutes what is this all right it's

764
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:42,659
kind of funky cool and now it's on fire oh yeah that's cool not gonna be using

765
01:33:42,659 --> 01:34:02,279
it though 60 wait 61 plus 25 this is better I guess I mean what do I want to

766
01:34:02,279 --> 01:34:12,680
upgrade this is the highest scaling I'll try it for a few minutes why not wait

767
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:20,770
can I come on oh my goodness you don't doesn't have to be a side arm that's not

768
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:26,159
even a side arm this is an actual weapon all right cool well I'll try it for a

769
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:38,260
little while are you the booger guy oh yeah you probably found me from that

770
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:43,670
clip of me like I thought the stream was off then the camera was still on it was

771
01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:47,949
pretty dark but I said you know you can still see and I just I just ate a shit

772
01:34:47,949 --> 01:34:49,989
little bit too I was I was eating boogers in the chair for like ten

773
01:34:49,989 --> 01:34:52,630
straight minutes I know everyone's seen the clip by now but whatever yeah that's

774
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:56,550
fine I'm glad you found the stream I mean without that viral clip I wouldn't

775
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:06,699
have you know you wouldn't have been here you wouldn't have found it all

776
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:13,640
right so this is just the three doses oh all right I'll come back and figure this

777
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:21,710
out later these grenades work pretty well yeah I'm gonna buy many of these I

778
01:35:21,710 --> 01:35:36,460
can look at I can upgrade something so what can I upgrade how come there's still

779
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:44,409
a you can upgrade thing oh cuz I have keys I'm gonna hold on to him dog I'm

780
01:35:44,409 --> 01:35:59,640
not I want to use him all right let's go so that I opened up the shortcut which

781
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:26,000
is here now I'm not wearing a hairnet as items cool god damn it everything has

782
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:37,069
been cool so far I'm going the wrong way I'm definitely going the wrong way

783
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:55,460
there it is this is the right way right yeah oh shit oh shit oh shit am I going

784
01:36:55,460 --> 01:37:04,939
wrong am I going the wrong way wait is that the wrong way didn't I open up a

785
01:37:04,939 --> 01:37:14,100
shortcut that led right here wait I'm confused oh thanks God I've got the

786
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:32,970
compass otherwise this would have been a lot harder there it is excellent I am

787
01:37:33,409 --> 01:37:44,960
yes okay we got it I'm so glad that exists hey you know what they could have

788
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,720
done which would have been funny if to turn the compass on it takes souls it's

789
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:54,840
like 500 souls to turn the compass on so that would be funny and it scales as you

790
01:37:54,840 --> 01:38:03,630
level would have been kind of fun that would have been kind of funny all right

791
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:17,779
there we go this is what I'm doing don't worry about that this is it all

792
01:38:17,779 --> 01:38:37,850
right let's freaking go the hell was that that's fire looks crazy that

793
01:38:37,850 --> 01:39:22,140
actually looks awesome shit oh now you're on fire we haven't been on fire

794
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:37,390
this whole time that took a long time to get you there get up there get up go go

795
01:39:37,390 --> 01:40:07,449
go go go go no ammo be drunk be talking about I could be using a yo-yo cuz it's

796
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:16,390
kind of fun all right the weapons cool but it's a little too slow for me that's

797
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:45,119
a little too much to lead up very cool though essence of a valiant spirit okay

801
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:53,260

803
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:04,859
frame I've ever been in my whole life on stream it's the most in frame this is

818
01:46:21,010 --> 01:46:25,890
robot I made out of metal and shit why would a falling five feet off why would

819
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:48,909
that hurt me it's like driving through a pothole all right that's fair wait

820
01:46:48,909 --> 01:47:19,420
what's over here even at max resolution your cameras off wow that does a lot of

821
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:31,840

824
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,369
not I'm well by the way those that are trickling in let's go over it again so

825
01:48:11,369 --> 01:48:16,810
oh I have to I've been trying to figure out I'm gonna do this I have to sign and

826
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:29,680
ship a thousand baseballs and it's time to do that so what we're doing is we're

827
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:38,739
doing an Omega weekend this weekend they're the plan was I was gonna do

828
01:48:38,739 --> 01:48:42,300
maybe tomorrow and Wednesday but I said you know what no I'm gonna get this done

829
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:49,010
I want to get it done I want to actually put real time into it and care so I'm

830
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:53,970
gonna spend the next couple days signing boxing and shipping a thousand

831
01:48:53,970 --> 01:49:01,010
baseballs so Friday Saturday Sunday we're gonna do an Omega weekend three

832
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:14,020
days in a row stream the signing that's it's possible but I'm not gonna

833
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:17,060
guarantee that I'm gonna say that probably won't happen all right do I have

834
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:28,750
enough stream the signing stream the signing I yeah I don't know I don't it

835
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:40,569
feels odd to me I don't want to do that I have a lot of these okay I I have a

836
01:49:40,569 --> 01:49:49,970
criticism if the devs are watching I I like it when it goes like this shows the

837
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:56,359
amount that I added like when it I want it to be like you know what I mean

838
01:49:56,359 --> 01:50:05,430
because when I use one of these in the menu it's just kind of like yeah I used

839
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:12,380
it it doesn't like show that like on the bottom or something it says like the

840
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:17,159
amount that's on it but I don't have a real-time calculation they're not

841
01:50:17,159 --> 01:50:20,859
watching you told me they were you literally said that like an hour ago

842
01:50:20,859 --> 01:50:35,649
all right it's time to choose a weapon this would be 60 this would be it's not

843
01:50:35,649 --> 01:50:43,720
this one it's probably this or what would that be 48 is it the claws or is

844
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:53,489
it the the falchion the claws are gonna have the best scaling but do I like them

845
01:50:53,489 --> 01:51:03,140
better I'll show on or or claws I this move set was better but it scales worse

846
01:51:03,140 --> 01:51:18,229
not that it matters at this early should be the falchion all right get a poll

847
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:22,810
going because I actually don't know and I'm seeing a lot of both one for

848
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:30,359
falchion and saber two for claws and we're gonna be upgrading that buddy the

849
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:33,439
long face because I'm a goofy motherfucker they die do I have to

850
01:51:33,439 --> 01:51:52,869
answer that one or two one is falchion and saber and two is nemesis claws one

851
01:51:52,869 --> 01:52:05,500
two I'm afraid to alt tab so I can't click on it so hopefully you guys can I

852
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:18,170
get an update of what the percentage is claws have a parry yeah but all right so

853
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:21,770
this has a parry but this has the cool blade tornado that has a different

854
01:52:21,770 --> 01:52:30,630
damage scale it's interesting falchion is winning by a lot okay oh I didn't we

855
01:52:30,630 --> 01:52:38,289
didn't even look at this yeah all right so there's no way it's coming back

856
01:52:38,289 --> 01:52:42,689
congratulations I'll share and saber enjoyers that's what we're gonna

857
01:52:42,689 --> 01:53:02,680
upgrade and I'm gonna do it right now there we go all right so that I'm gonna

858
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:07,800
be doing a lot more damage I think looks good very cool other moves that on this

859
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:21,239
is good as well cool all right I'm ready can you play so much or scare

860
01:53:21,239 --> 01:53:28,819
Saturdays this October we'll do a bunch of horror stuff I'll do a lot of horror

861
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:42,119
stuff this month coming up we'll get a list so good it takes almost the whole

862
01:53:42,119 --> 01:53:49,229
stamina bar but it kills almost anything in one hit will you do Halloween movie

863
01:53:49,229 --> 01:53:54,920
night if I can find some more public domain horror movies yeah they have to

864
01:53:54,920 --> 01:54:17,560
be public domain all right let's get it where we going here yeah oh that came

865
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:51,590
out far that move is so good there's a combo with the R2 pretty good you know I

866
01:54:51,590 --> 01:54:56,430
really do wonder I genuinely probably should look into this I wonder just how

867
01:54:56,430 --> 01:55:00,560
much money it would cost what the cost effectiveness kind of ratio there would

868
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,680
be to like how much this cost or how fun we could have on stream for me to just

869
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:10,609
buy the licensing streaming rights to be able to show a movie on stream for a

870
01:55:10,609 --> 01:55:16,909
night it can't be that expensive some of these old movies right some of these

871
01:55:16,909 --> 01:55:23,810
old old fucking movies there's no way that would be you know how much am I

872
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:32,340
willing to pay for that a lot more than I think a lot of you guys think actually

873
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:35,659
go through the rights holders and be like hey can I scream this movie without

874
01:55:35,659 --> 01:55:52,819
you having a problem with it what the fuck you can do that I wonder how far

875
01:55:52,819 --> 01:55:59,300
that could go right I wonder how much money would it take to stream like

876
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:03,979
gremlins to somebody was saying I wonder what that would cost it's I mean it's

877
01:56:03,979 --> 01:56:10,090
Warner right it's expensive but not that bad I know people that own a retro shit

878
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:15,350
wait hold on you do wait wait wait wait it I want to all tab but with mods mods

879
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:21,930
find that person that just said that that they know how that works and and I

880
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:29,380
would like to question them and you know I mean I want to like talk to them can

881
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:37,020
we like ask that person some stuff and I want to interrogate that person find

882
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:41,550
that person because we're gonna interrogate what do you know about

883
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:48,710
getting the rights to gremlins to what do you know I know people that own a

884
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:51,710
retro cinema and they do it all the time all right well let's maybe we could

885
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:57,859
find out some info because I am willing I'm not kidding around I I wish I was

886
01:56:57,859 --> 01:57:00,500
joking when I say this but I'm willing to put thousands and thousands of

887
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:04,819
dollars and to be to be able to do that I am willing to put up money to be able

888
01:57:04,819 --> 01:57:09,399
to stream some old dumb horror movie that could get the stream shut down

889
01:57:09,399 --> 01:57:18,300
right because they have to be a license pretty much per movie wouldn't that be

890
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:24,460
fun should we'd be like licensed movie Andy let's do it let's do it I'm gonna

891
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:27,220
look into it I'm gonna get on the phone with community Jake literally tonight

892
01:57:27,220 --> 01:57:32,100
let's see if it's possible well I will talk to the person that has experience

893
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:37,199
doing it because that would be really fun oh no what happens if it's too fun

894
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:46,079
and that's like all I want to do oh well whatever private domain movie night

895
01:57:46,079 --> 01:58:09,579
that's right oh you were over here that doesn't stagger too dark over here I

896
01:58:09,579 --> 01:58:22,600
can't see yeah let's let's buy the licensing rights to a bunch of old horror

897
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:30,819
movies and maybe who cares movies that aren't horrible I mean I wonder how

898
01:58:30,819 --> 01:58:36,630
much does it cost to stream a licensing deal with like three men and a baby that

899
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:46,100
possible I mean these movies are old they're really old and they're probably

900
01:58:46,100 --> 01:59:04,789
on streaming services I don't know what about an Amazon watch party see I don't

901
01:59:04,789 --> 01:59:10,989
want to do that because that I that kind of like sucks from my understanding the

902
01:59:10,989 --> 01:59:14,590
way that that works is only certain people from certain regions can do it

903
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:20,340
there's a very limited amount of shows to watch and it's not me streaming it

904
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:24,579
right doesn't it like take over the stream and it's not like me hanging out

905
01:59:24,579 --> 01:59:29,180
with like a cam on right it's pretty limited to what you can do with it I

906
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:36,609
would rather have people be able to hang out and enjoy it they never work either

907
01:59:36,609 --> 01:59:43,699
if it's you and a mini player no no no no I would I would want to buy one night

908
01:59:43,699 --> 01:59:47,380
streaming rights to some of these movies and just do it the way that we would

909
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:55,229
want to do it the vaude would have to be destroyed too yeah I just wouldn't

910
01:59:55,229 --> 01:59:57,989
turn the vaude on that would be a thing that people knew was gonna happen right

911
01:59:57,989 --> 02:00:04,390
it's hey we're do we're streaming this movie it cost me like $14,000 to buy the

912
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:07,949
rights to stream this movie for a night you're gonna want to be there alive

913
02:00:07,949 --> 02:00:12,640
because it's not gonna be I'm not gonna have a vaude or whatever like insane

914
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:22,739
amount of money it costs I'm afraid of this they're a shortcut or something I'm

915
02:00:22,739 --> 02:00:39,380
afraid of going through there oh hello wait hold on just release the audio

916
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:46,750
recording of your voice that could do that probably get it sponsored I don't

917
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:55,539
think I would want to do that because I would want us to be able to just say and

918
02:00:55,539 --> 02:00:58,899
have just have fun and not worry about like oh you know the rights holder is

919
02:00:58,899 --> 02:01:04,859
here can't talk about how like shitty that scene was right it's just I'm buying

920
02:01:04,859 --> 02:01:10,789
the rights to stream this that's it unless it was made very clear that the

921
02:01:10,789 --> 02:01:13,869
rights holder that they just didn't care at all they're like you'd literally say

922
02:01:13,869 --> 02:01:25,489
whatever you want you can do whatever you want please do it with Morbius I do

923
02:01:25,489 --> 02:01:29,369
not I do not have the capital to be able to buy the rights to stream Morbius

924
02:01:29,369 --> 02:01:33,729
you're talking about potentially I wanted to take a wild guess it would

925
02:01:33,729 --> 02:01:38,850
probably cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to stream Morbius legally to this

926
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:45,520
channel can you imagine if I spent like five hundred and like thirty thousand

927
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,590
dollars just just liquidate everything I own to be able to stream Morbius for one

928
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,220
night I mean that would be kind of funny then that would probably get a lot of

929
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:02,979
press streamer liquidates entire net worth to stream Morbius for one night

930
02:02:02,979 --> 02:02:08,420
just like two thousand one hundred and twenty five people you know what I mean

931
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,260
it would be it would be like that it would be like oh yeah dude Morbius let's

932
02:02:11,260 --> 02:02:22,229
go like two thousand one hundred and and like ten people would show up all

933
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:40,369
right where's the bonfire that would be so funny though I think to make that

934
02:02:40,369 --> 02:02:45,010
even a reality I'm trying to think of the legal way logistically you would

935
02:02:45,010 --> 02:02:49,489
have to do that I would need to make a business I would have to make a new LLC

936
02:02:49,489 --> 02:02:53,810
or something right and I'm a movie theater it's a oh yes I'm a movie

937
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:58,909
theater and I'm streaming movies and then buy the rights for my movie theater

938
02:02:58,909 --> 02:03:06,270
to stream to like thirty or forty thousand people with my movie see how

939
02:03:06,270 --> 02:03:22,529
would this even work all right I'm getting lost here where's the I'm talking

940
02:03:22,529 --> 02:03:33,600
about being okay wait wait where am I wait there's a bonfire here somewhere see

941
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:37,119
if you should contact Warner and see if they would want to do a gremlins movie

942
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:43,729
night I don't I I don't think okay here we go I don't think that no that's not

943
02:03:43,729 --> 02:03:47,489
gonna happen that would not happen yeah I mean we would there would be a we

944
02:03:47,489 --> 02:03:54,340
would do it and it'd be fun but there's no way it's not possible I'm not I I am a

945
02:03:54,340 --> 02:04:04,409
I am a small fry in the grand scheme of all media that's not gonna happen I'm a

946
02:04:04,409 --> 02:04:08,130
small fry in the grand scheme of things I'm not I cannot get the rights to

947
02:04:08,130 --> 02:04:10,689
gremlins you know what I mean it's not happening

948
02:04:10,689 --> 02:04:25,050
don't anymore crunchies I do have a crunchy so you mean I just used it I

949
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:39,260
want like a and count on the bottom right I see I'm thinking health or just

950
02:04:39,260 --> 02:04:48,199
keep going with his agility I do another weapon no what do I do

951
02:04:48,199 --> 02:05:06,609
see health can you run out of the compass all right I feel like there's

952
02:05:06,609 --> 02:05:17,539
something going on here yeah I I'm trying to think of how much some of

953
02:05:17,539 --> 02:05:24,300
these old horror movies that no one real I 10 grand 20 grand would be let's be

954
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:27,979
realistic how much do you think that would really be then if I was gonna buy

955
02:05:27,979 --> 02:05:33,479
the rights to scream for one night like five four or five movies that would be

956
02:05:33,479 --> 02:05:49,670
every a lot I'll be 4k 5k maybe not more than a few thousand I wonder what the

957
02:05:49,670 --> 02:06:04,159
Agra range on this out of here all right let's get this is definitely boss I have

958
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:16,680
three of these keys I wonder if I should use them yeah cuz something very we talk

959
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:21,119
about this sometimes something very important to know is if a movie is free

960
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:26,239
to watch it is not free to stream it to broadcast I don't I don't have

961
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:37,069
broadcasting rights to some of these properties right there's a huge

962
02:06:37,069 --> 02:06:51,239
difference between this is free to watch and this is free to broadcast be cool

963
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:57,649
though I'll look into it maybe if you've used one of the platforms that you

964
02:06:57,649 --> 02:07:03,359
stream the ads they'll they won't care no I would need because the way that it

965
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:08,479
works right on I think on twitch is somebody can just shut the stream down

966
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,159
they can just claim the stream they can be like nope I don't think so and just

967
02:07:12,159 --> 02:07:17,210
turn it off so it would have to be expressed written permission from the

968
02:07:17,210 --> 02:07:21,369
rights holder so no one can just go excuse me turn this off it'd be like no

969
02:07:21,369 --> 02:07:25,609
no no that I've already been in contact with which and the rights holder this is

970
02:07:25,609 --> 02:07:37,949
the screen staying on I'll look into it I really will I don't care scream it

971
02:07:37,989 --> 02:07:58,340
loser we're trying to figure out how risky stupid don't fall off the edge

972
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:33,430
they can hit each other shit was dumb what the fuck has happened okay we're

973
02:08:33,430 --> 02:08:39,340
good I didn't use any heels streaming but make everything look like a normal

974
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:42,819
stream have a cover of you gaming a random video game and everything then

975
02:08:42,819 --> 02:08:45,500
just play movies illegally without anyone noticing how does that doesn't

976
02:08:45,500 --> 02:08:54,189
make any sense what's your your thought process on that stream with a game but

977
02:08:54,189 --> 02:08:59,779
then have the movie like what that we switch to so when people say that hey

978
02:08:59,779 --> 02:09:04,800
this twitch staff in chat I hit a button and it goes to me playing steel rising

979
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:13,050
like we got like mom caught us I mean that would be funny but I would get

980
02:09:13,050 --> 02:09:22,250
banned I don't know how long you can request a stream it for free oh yeah

981
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:28,930
absolutely you a lot of these talks would be hey can I do this not hey can I

982
02:09:28,930 --> 02:09:34,489
give you $25,000 to stream the gremlins to no it would be like hey can we work

983
02:09:34,489 --> 02:09:44,300
something out that will start there you start at hey can I do this and then it

984
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:47,439
goes through well I don't think so not unless you decide to pay for the rights

985
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:56,920
that's when you go negotiator in there me I'll bring that price down how much

986

1059
02:28:36,729 --> 02:29:00,520
my side you get a lawyer on your side and out we'll do it there I hope you

1060
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:17,139
have one for your movie stream I'm gonna figure that out I'm gonna use a law

1061
02:29:17,139 --> 02:29:50,790
firm I'm gonna use my trusted law firm gonzo and gonzo it's a funny to get the

1062
02:29:50,790 --> 02:29:56,360
rights to have gonzo be my lawyer would probably cost more money than just

1063
02:29:57,360 --> 02:30:02,809
without like a shirt on to the meeting and have like sunglasses and have like a

1064
02:30:02,809 --> 02:30:08,350
bad sunburn all over me and being like and being a bathing suit and be like

1065
02:30:08,350 --> 02:30:15,829
here's 20 grand it would cost more money to do it the other way like it

1066
02:30:15,829 --> 02:30:21,479
would cost gonzo as a lawyer would be like a hundred thousand dollars forget

1067
02:30:21,479 --> 02:30:27,049
that I can literally just show up without a lawyer and just give them a

1068
02:30:27,049 --> 02:30:32,360
check for 20 grand it would be less money why would you have no shirt on

1069
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:58,620
I came to the beach not real why is he getting naked at the beach what are you

1070

1074
02:31:35,950 --> 02:31:43,420
relaxing before a stressful period I don't know I'm saying like it would be

1075
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:51,959
so casual instead of having to hire gonzo for a 500 grand I used to show up

1076
02:31:51,959 --> 02:32:01,770
with a tank top it like it like long socks dad socks how to slide through

spotlight here sorry nope I'm really trying to get that spotlight out of

1167
02:55:11,030 --> 02:55:20,149
context that is a little strange second I'm slowly processing which is

1168
02:55:20,149 --> 02:55:26,809
happening all these ball fondler Andes that's out of context that that's a

1169
02:55:26,809 --> 02:55:34,889
little strange and it's the hot dog stream all the ball fondler Andes what

1170
02:55:34,889 --> 02:55:44,379
is that supposed to mean that I'm I'm I'm confusing myself they think they're

1177
02:58:30,319 --> 02:58:55,639
good it's so good there's no diminishing returns on this should

02:58:55,639 --> 02:59:01,790
have taken that bet she's Andy all right should I not use that anymore it's not

1179
02:59:01,790 --> 02:59:06,260
okay it's not fair if I use that anymore that's too good it actually probably

1180
02:59:06,260 --> 02:59:09,920
should okay it's probably gonna get patched one hot dog I didn't get hit

1181
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:21,420
once that's gonna get patched that's gonna get that out of the game no when

1182
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:37,760
did I get hit I didn't get it once look at your health it was like that already

1185
02:59:56,139 --> 03:00:04,309
bosses in a row and that's with no points okay if you play the alchemy

1186
03:00:04,309 --> 03:00:10,729
class and you get this weapon you'll just you could literally just kill

1187
03:00:10,729 --> 03:00:19,389
everybody I won't cheese the bosses anymore the next boss I will not cheese

1188
03:00:19,389 --> 03:00:41,569

1189
03:00:41,569 --> 03:00:59,270
gonna get patched what is attacking me from somewhere they'll add some type of

1190
03:00:59,270 --> 03:01:02,670
bosses cannot be frozen more than once or twice like in a row or something

1191
03:01:02,670 --> 03:01:49,000
right ketchup or mustard mustard harder than the boss am I gonna die what the

1192

1193
03:02:33,079 --> 03:02:39,299
mustard yeah I don't really like yellow mustard I do like brown mustard kind of

1194
03:02:39,299 --> 03:02:50,340
ground mustard very good all right I can upgrade this again I need 3,000 souls

1195
03:02:50,340 --> 03:03:08,989
that's a lot brown mustard like ground stone ground mustard I'm not gonna use

1196
03:03:08,989 --> 03:03:19,479
this fight or flight physical damage and impact when her health is at its lowest

1197
03:03:19,479 --> 03:03:30,959
or I mean that's the frost I'm sorry the children in the chat don't like real

1198
03:03:30,959 --> 03:03:48,829
mustard I think a lot of people here do that's part of the secret recipe though

1199
03:03:48,829 --> 03:04:13,559
I already did this let's keep going this game's cute all right we are about to

1200
03:04:13,559 --> 03:04:25,680
repair the walkway you're a corporate honey Dijon spy I like honey mustard but

1201
03:04:25,680 --> 03:04:35,569
I prefer stone ground I think it's I like the little pebbles is this sponsored

1202
03:04:35,569 --> 03:04:43,170
no and I would have to tell you I'm just playing because I told you I it looks

1203
03:04:43,170 --> 03:04:48,579
fun it is fun I would not play this game for three hours if I didn't think it was

1204
03:04:48,579 --> 03:04:59,750
fun that should work I just gotta stop being a cheeseball it's been fight the

1205
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:28,430
bosses for real all right so that opens this I like this game too yes it's fine

1206
03:05:28,430 --> 03:05:34,280
it's good I think it's good I think it'll it'll scratch some of that itch oh

1207
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:59,260
wait hello why did you turn around that's pretty good get the free hits

1208
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:15,450
using the op weapon isn't cheese that's just the game yeah but I have okay I

1209
03:06:15,450 --> 03:06:25,670
have not dodged a boss's attack in two and a half hours that's that's a fact

1210
03:06:25,709 --> 03:06:40,020
increases immobilization oh that's kind of good actually I like what I have

1211
03:06:40,020 --> 03:06:57,770
better all right ah this works now just in case I miss an item which I don't

1217
03:08:06,040 --> 03:08:27,360
oh so peace I was given orders to come here an automatic the talks you don't

1218
03:08:27,360 --> 03:08:33,510
gonna have this guy's careful consoles dancer I saw you perform in Versailles

1219
03:08:33,510 --> 03:08:43,049
when you were first presented to the Queen wait there all of a sudden there

1220
03:08:43,049 --> 03:08:51,500
are dialogue options there are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade so I

1221
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:56,940
saw yes and a little too closely for my liking it's a miracle I escaped alive

1222
03:08:56,940 --> 03:09:02,180
just by these are valid I saw one take a volley of gunfire hold for an instant

1223
03:09:02,180 --> 03:09:07,219
then carry on as if nothing happened but no machine however resilient is

1224
03:09:07,219 --> 03:09:13,299
indestructible these automats must have a weakness some vital axle gear that we

1225
03:09:13,299 --> 03:09:18,459
can target I don't suppose you would know you who share their nature no blast

1226
03:09:18,459 --> 03:09:23,299
that is unfortunate I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the

1227
03:09:23,299 --> 03:09:31,319
matter but to no avail there are machines wreaking havoc on the Esplanade

1228
03:09:31,319 --> 03:09:37,280
so I saw yes and a little too closely for my liking it's a miracle I escaped

1229
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:42,399
alive just by these are valid I saw one take a volley of gunfire hold for an

1230
03:09:42,399 --> 03:09:58,159
instant then carry on as if nothing happened but no machine however resilient is indestructible these automats must have a weakness some vital axle gear that we can target I don't suppose you would know why we doing this again this is okay

1231
03:09:58,159 --> 03:10:10,760
no blast that is unfortunate I scoured the workshop hoping to shed some light on the matter wasn't that different dialogue wait that this was different dialogue there are machines oh no

1232
03:10:10,760 --> 03:10:15,879
just by this but no these automats some vital I don't suppose you would know no

1233
03:10:15,879 --> 03:10:25,280
blast I scared okay it's a little on so I was watching a YouTube video the other

1234
03:10:25,280 --> 03:10:29,520
night and that was weird I would cut to you like as if I'm talking to this guy

1235
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:35,360

1265
03:15:19,290 --> 03:15:25,620
my entire place use a wired controller I'm this is what I'm wired I'm plugged

1273
03:16:42,639 --> 03:16:53,379
it's fun really really the bosses are kind of easy but that's the kind of

1274
03:16:53,379 --> 03:16:56,819
character I'm playing I won't if I was a strength character I bet you'd be

1275
03:16:56,819 --> 03:17:12,340
having a lot more trouble I kept hearing the little dude dude okay where should I

1276
03:17:12,340 --> 03:17:18,639
go take the batteries out of the controller now that's a brilliant idea

1277
03:17:18,639 --> 03:17:28,540
that's actually a smart idea mmm honest to God that's the smartest thing I've

1278
03:17:28,540 --> 03:18:03,020
ever heard oh wait can I oh does that still work I'm gonna go to la city god

1280
03:18:22,079 --> 03:19:04,149
this area wait let me do the e3 walk it's very specific I almost got it I hope

1281
03:19:04,149 --> 03:19:10,540
there's an enemy here yep shit I made the game look like shit I'm sorry don't

1282
03:19:10,540 --> 03:19:39,049
fire me I do like this area though it's definitely not yeah do it again with

1283
03:19:39,049 --> 03:19:51,700
music less hellies I need souls gonna need to upgrade this weapon

1284
03:19:51,700 --> 03:20:02,049
dogs are too fast for that whoa whoa whoa whoa

1285
03:20:02,049 --> 03:20:15,090
the other one died oh they explode okay I like the fire effects in this game

1286
03:20:15,569 --> 03:20:56,049
my eye tricky area right it you're gonna replay it's secure oh I'd rather punch

1287
03:20:56,049 --> 03:21:08,110
myself in the face square in the nose then play through secure again if I had

1288
03:21:08,110 --> 03:21:12,979
an option here but you can punch yourself as hard as you can directly in

1289
03:21:12,979 --> 03:21:17,020
your face like right here or you have to start a new playthrough of secure Oh and

1290
03:21:17,020 --> 03:21:21,420
get to the end and beat the whole game get the true ending I'd go now I do it

1291
03:21:21,420 --> 03:21:29,780
now you hate secure oh no I don't hate secure oh it's just fucking impossibly

1292
03:21:29,780 --> 03:21:36,659
difficult I've gone back to it before in the last since beating it I just go no

1293
03:21:36,659 --> 03:21:48,319
no why am I doing this what's the point of you playing with I cannot come up

1294
03:21:48,319 --> 03:21:54,000
with a reason to play secure oh yeah that is the hardest game I've ever played

1295
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:59,379
and yes I had the same thing oh you know what maybe I'll play secure oh again

1296
03:21:59,379 --> 03:22:03,020
that sounds kind of like fun yeah it's like really tough and but Perry's I get

1297
03:22:03,059 --> 03:22:08,700
that's such a fun game and you get to the first boss fight get to lady

1298
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:17,020
butterfly or the big guy the big drunk guy you go what am I doing here I could

1299
03:22:17,020 --> 03:22:20,899
play Mario Party and you know what I mean I could know that I don't want to

1300
03:22:20,899 --> 03:22:29,870
do that I could do anything else skill issue that drunk guy fight well you have

1301
03:22:29,870 --> 03:22:33,909
to fight like 15 people and him at the same time it's just like what I why am I

1302
03:22:34,350 --> 03:22:39,670

1303
03:22:39,670 --> 03:22:53,569
twice all right let me pay attention please before I lose it's kicking my

1304
03:22:53,569 --> 03:23:02,879
ass double swing all right I've been hit by you that any of the bosses in the

1305
03:23:02,879 --> 03:23:23,540
game all right skill issue let's go quiet up there and I even get up there I

1306
03:23:23,540 --> 03:23:54,440
can't so whatever screw it bring us me strong will you get down here so I can

1307
03:23:54,559 --> 03:24:18,329
Jesus I dodged the other way they're the me strong playthrough I tell us it's

1308
03:24:18,329 --> 03:24:24,760
never gonna happen I just don't think it will because it's one thing okay yeah I

1309
03:24:24,760 --> 03:24:32,120
I are taking marijuana off stream and stuff right but I don't I don't know I

1310
03:24:32,120 --> 03:24:39,280
feel like that's really that's some kind of endorsement somehow to like dude hey

1311
03:24:39,280 --> 03:24:43,200
just like smoke weed and play games man just like play game while you're high

1312
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:54,549
it's so much more fun yeah look at how look at how fun this is it's not yeah I

1313
03:24:54,549 --> 03:25:00,579
don't want to if I were to the me strong playthrough I wouldn't say anything it

1314
03:25:00,579 --> 03:25:03,379
would be like guys I'm doing me strong today and I wouldn't say anything else

1315
03:25:03,379 --> 03:25:11,659
but then people that are just like why is he sucks such as why is he so bad he

1316
03:25:11,659 --> 03:25:17,790
has to be making this up that right I get there's gonna be no way to hide that

1317
03:25:18,149 --> 03:25:36,079
because it would be undeniable what was going on yeah that's the playthrough

1318
03:25:36,079 --> 03:25:40,399
where I make a big caveman guy and put every single point in strength and try

1319
03:25:40,399 --> 03:25:48,239
to beat like get through fucking like like Godric's castle think I could do it

1320
03:25:48,239 --> 03:26:00,829
yeah every single point has to be in strength let's be a caveman all right

1321
03:26:00,829 --> 03:26:14,260
what am I missing something here didn't you stream drunk before yeah I mean

1322
03:26:14,379 --> 03:26:20,790
I don't know I to me there's a difference in my brain or oh I'm drinking

1323
03:26:20,790 --> 03:26:25,909
on stream versus I'm drunk it's this it's part of the stream is me I'm drunk

1324
03:26:25,909 --> 03:26:33,590
I'm drunk scream I'm drunk and I have to play this game trashed right like I could

1325
03:26:33,590 --> 03:26:38,069
drink on stream it's not like part of oh yeah it's because the stream is live so

1326
03:26:38,069 --> 03:26:44,510
that's why I'm drinking a lot I don't know how do I get up there I don't

1327
03:26:44,510 --> 03:26:50,780
know influencer Andy influencer Andy I mean I could just it is you know okay

1328
03:26:50,780 --> 03:26:54,940
this is an 18 plus story and whatever mature content warning but still I don't

1329
03:26:54,940 --> 03:27:00,610
wanted to make it people think that dude just like fucking get high and like play

1330
03:27:00,610 --> 03:27:04,809
Elden ring and it's like what I'm doing you should be that's what I do why don't

1331
03:27:04,809 --> 03:27:16,930
you do it too so much cooler this way I don't know it's probably a place to do

1332
03:27:16,930 --> 03:27:24,870
it and not be like influencer Andy I genuinely don't know how to get up there

1333
03:27:25,030 --> 03:27:55,579
yes it's this way yes it definitely is you're an adult do what you want yeah I

1334
03:27:55,579 --> 03:28:13,100
know I know I'm overthinking it I do that a lot though that's Virgo that's a

1335
03:28:13,100 --> 03:28:29,930
Virgo behavior I mean it makes me that I'm whatever I have a lot of those

1336
03:28:29,930 --> 03:28:48,639
essences it's time to crush them all right there we go are you gonna play

1337
03:28:48,639 --> 03:29:01,069
scorn what's scorn they're good the movement looks fun in this game it's

1338
03:29:01,110 --> 03:29:05,989
very clean all right however you want to look at this and talk about this a lot

1339
03:29:05,989 --> 03:29:11,030
of the Dark Souls kind of clone games they all have the same problem where it

1340
03:29:11,030 --> 03:29:17,350
it feels like kind of off somehow and we're like clunky this feels good to

1341
03:29:17,350 --> 03:29:23,459
play this feels good I have not had a complaint at all about how the combat

1342
03:29:23,459 --> 03:29:30,799
animations are or besides the hitboxes maybe it's very clean it's very polished

1343
03:29:30,840 --> 03:29:36,309
put it that way it's a polished game I know I did crash out but you know what

1344
03:29:36,309 --> 03:29:48,459
I'm saying oh my god that guy just killed me he's letting the dev down

1345
03:29:48,459 --> 03:30:03,110
lightly that's not what's happening I look at how many souls I have what the

1346
03:30:03,110 --> 03:30:22,000
hell is going on I have a lot oh my god I'm bad this reminds me of a 360 game in

1347
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:39,030
a good way I know what you mean by that I know what that means damn it I had

1348
03:30:39,030 --> 03:30:43,149
enough and I have I just blew it wait how much how many points do I have shit

1349
03:30:43,149 --> 03:30:55,110
that was stupid actually I might have enough do I have enough two thousand is

1350
03:30:55,110 --> 03:31:01,649
it two or three thousand upgrade the weapon shit three all right I'll just

1351
03:31:01,649 --> 03:31:12,350
farm for a sec your face is blocking the souls why did it take you that long for

1352
03:31:12,350 --> 03:31:18,659
someone to tell me this I can't all tab though I have two thousand you see that

1353
03:31:18,659 --> 03:31:30,729
anywhere how come nobody told me this oh well you're an idiot

1354
03:31:30,930 --> 03:31:46,500
what was that guy doing get to 3,000 and I'm gonna turn around okay hold on now

1355
03:31:46,500 --> 03:32:36,010
oh that's cool stop blocking me it's not fair I'm out of stamina already

1356
03:32:39,329 --> 03:32:50,020
what happened to the hamster stream um to refresh people's memories it's when I

1357
03:32:50,020 --> 03:32:55,549
was gonna dress up with like ears and like teeth here and just be in a ball

1358
03:32:55,549 --> 03:33:00,430
over there and have like a couple of toys and like a one of those water

1359
03:33:00,430 --> 03:33:04,030
durable water things and I was gonna eat seeds and shit and I wasn't gonna say

1360
03:33:04,030 --> 03:33:09,770
anything and see how long until I lost like 5,000 subs it was like gonna be

1361
03:33:09,770 --> 03:33:12,770
experiment but I said decided against it I was gonna have a tube I could go

1362
03:33:12,770 --> 03:33:17,209
through between rooms and stuff and you could give me bits to like drop seeds

1363
03:33:17,209 --> 03:33:36,360
down that turned out it was gonna be too expensive all right so I went this way

1364
03:33:36,360 --> 03:33:45,940
already this is the way they came right yeah I like the heel animation it's

1365
03:33:45,940 --> 03:34:02,290
cool and I would have a bunch of made-up catchphrases when a new sub came in I

1366
03:34:02,290 --> 03:34:13,209
go oh I sure wish I had some cheese thank you so and everyone was just spam

1367
03:34:13,209 --> 03:34:15,370
laughing and shit even though it was not funny

1368
03:34:15,370 --> 03:34:26,879
hamsters don't eat cheese yeah and next I'd be like oh next time give me some

1369
03:34:26,879 --> 03:34:41,370
candy and go like like into the camera I wonder how many people would leave

1370
03:34:41,489 --> 03:34:57,440
permanently she's to meet you where am I going I never if I if the compass

1371
03:34:57,440 --> 03:35:03,989

1381
03:36:30,690 --> 03:36:33,649
waste to this city there's nothing stranger than that

1382
03:36:33,649 --> 03:36:39,329
face just what mission has the marquee entrusted you with I must meet with

1383
03:36:39,329 --> 03:36:44,930
Abbe Gaiquah alas you've come too late the Abbott has got it into his head to

1384
03:36:44,930 --> 03:36:49,940
go to the palette I can't even get it to stay there he is certain that Monseigneur

1385
03:36:49,940 --> 03:36:54,459
de la Far the bishop of Nancy is being held prisoner by the monstrosity that

1386
03:36:54,459 --> 03:36:59,489
is wreaking havoc on the Ile de la Cité but how can he possibly hope to free him

1387
03:36:59,489 --> 03:37:04,049
the Abbott is a holy man who would lay down his life it's a holy man justice

1388
03:37:04,049 --> 03:37:08,770
okay but there isn't one among us who stands the slightest chance against

1389
03:37:08,770 --> 03:37:14,690
that thing not the slightest chance I wonder where I go from here though I

1390
03:37:14,690 --> 03:37:21,350
can't get it to stay don't look up in them into the I'm just a mirror don't

1391
03:37:21,350 --> 03:37:28,569
look up and say here's of cheese my mouth is too watery I can't I'm such a

1392
03:37:28,569 --> 03:37:34,299
I'm such a greasy person I can't get my teeth to stay there I missed that whole

1393
03:37:34,459 --> 03:38:02,610
thing what I'm oh I gotta turn these in oh that what I looked like what the fuck

1394
03:38:02,610 --> 03:38:18,940
what Jesus I look horrible oh my god it looks I hate it I genuinely hate that

1395
03:38:18,940 --> 03:38:30,780
image oh it's like triggering a response it's triggering a response I don't I

1396
03:38:30,780 --> 03:38:53,829
can't alt tab but those images are triggering a response how are you

1397
03:38:53,829 --> 03:39:14,030
supposed to avoid it that well please show it I will before the stream ends

1398

1400
03:39:34,459 --> 03:39:37,020
that though I feel like there's a lot of people that would want me to do that

1401
03:39:37,020 --> 03:39:49,120
because they would it they go yeah that's that's do it that's funny with

1402
03:39:49,120 --> 03:39:52,040
the ratio of the amount of people that leave the community permanently versus

1403
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:58,569
the amount of people that stay and give cheese bits what's the ratio do you

1404
03:39:58,569 --> 03:40:17,479
think I would legit call work off of that no you you would not you would fall

1405
03:40:17,479 --> 03:40:25,360
out sick from work if I was doing the hamster with the teeth and say cheese

1406
03:40:25,360 --> 03:40:51,430
bits and stuff you would call off work I would to be honest those of you that

1407
03:40:51,430 --> 03:40:59,829
said the game was not hard enough yeah we'll wait till you get to see the wrong

1410
03:41:42,149 --> 03:41:52,979
just so unforgiving brutal why we like it though that's why we play them brutal

1411

1414
03:42:31,239 --> 03:42:40,750

energy what's that mean you you were made of neither flesh nor blood you were an

1479
04:05:35,280 --> 04:05:39,540
automat like those who committed this massacre I have received no such

1480
04:05:39,540 --> 04:05:44,239
command I am carrying out a mission I've been in a weird mood today I'm sorry

1481
04:05:44,239 --> 04:05:53,479
your friend on Plas Saint-Marie informed me of your intentions alas I was not

1482
04:05:53,479 --> 04:05:57,950
able to reach the Palais de Justice I fear that the soul of Monseigneur de la

1483
04:05:57,950 --> 04:06:03,889
Far has lost forever was he killed what has been done to him is a fate worse

1484
04:06:03,889 --> 04:06:10,850
than death far worse but I could go no further there were so many bodies so

1485
04:06:10,850 --> 04:06:16,409
many innocent strewn about the square he means your cringe and your community is

1486
04:06:16,409 --> 04:06:21,690
annoying I felt it I don't think I think that's what you think I don't think

1487
04:06:21,690 --> 04:06:27,569
that's what they were saying it's hopeless the streets are teeming with

1488
04:06:27,569 --> 04:06:31,649
machines but the machine that is wreaking havoc in the area around the

1489
04:06:31,649 --> 04:06:36,809
palace colossal much much larger than yourself what's more the soul of his

1490
04:06:36,809 --> 04:06:39,969
excellency the bishop has been imprisoned within this way he dropped

1491
04:06:39,969 --> 04:06:43,969
the magic ring how could you not have picked up the magic ring dude he's just

1492
04:06:43,969 --> 04:07:03,219
like monologuing and we can just pick it up Bishop of Nancy ask the Lord to

1493
04:07:03,219 --> 04:07:14,100
bless this assembly and watch over this meeting of the estates general let us

1494
04:07:14,100 --> 04:07:19,299
not turn a blind eye to the misfortunes of a populace who is condemned to the

1495
04:07:19,299 --> 04:07:24,100
most abject poverty for there is no greater sin than to ignore the

1496
04:07:24,100 --> 04:07:35,399
suffering of one's brethren we're parted way gone straight I feel like I could

1497
04:07:35,399 --> 04:07:44,270
play that part pretty well of the court is an insult to the misery that reigns

1498
04:07:44,270 --> 04:07:52,610
in our lands in such dark times how can one conceive of hiding away to play

1499
04:07:53,450 --> 04:07:57,930

1563
04:24:47,350 --> 04:25:09,989
like in this game can't open that chest locked let's do it to feed the type here

1564
04:25:09,989 --> 04:25:21,110
we go

1565
04:25:26,110 --> 04:25:29,110
what should I eat

1566
04:25:37,149 --> 04:25:45,209
we must leave this place boss in you there's no time all right let's do it

1567
04:25:45,250 --> 04:26:06,739
see how cool this is oh hell yeah Golden Cross what's that Donald's maybe let me

1568
04:26:06,739 --> 04:26:19,750
take a look at my modules all right this is level two first physical damage by a

1569
04:26:19,750 --> 04:26:24,120
fully charged attack I feel like that's really hard to get done this one's good

1570
04:26:24,120 --> 04:26:37,979
do I have any other slot two slot ones don't I think these are fine all right

1571
04:26:37,979 --> 04:26:46,110
here we go Titan it's time for the game to impress us this is the point where

1572
04:26:46,110 --> 04:26:52,010
the game could impress everybody I'm curious we've fought a few mini bosses

1573
04:26:52,010 --> 04:27:09,260
it seems so far the game could impress us with a really cool boss fight I was I

1574
04:27:09,260 --> 04:27:39,180
was a hundred million years away here we go Titan fight almost time how much was

1575
04:27:39,180 --> 04:27:44,829
this game uh that's a good question I actually don't remember I bought this

1576
04:27:44,829 --> 04:27:54,670
game and then turned the stream on maybe six to seven minutes later I think was

1577
04:27:55,670 --> 04:28:14,479
rich Andy no I'm not saying that oh I just bought it I don't even care I just

1578
04:28:14,479 --> 04:28:18,000
say I I did I bought it it's like oh that's how much this was when I turned

1579
04:28:18,000 --> 04:28:33,479
that I took I got distracted by turning the stream on immediately okay how long

1580
04:28:33,479 --> 04:28:38,479
did it take to download I have fiber I know Omega low fiber like I drop frames

1581
04:28:38,479 --> 04:28:45,360
sometimes but it's a 1000 down connection so it's a gigabit happens

1582
04:28:45,360 --> 04:28:55,389
very quickly I do have a gigabit connection it's not my fault that this

1583
04:28:55,389 --> 04:29:09,690
some reason twitch hates my connection to the servers I know flex I mean it

1584
04:29:09,690 --> 04:29:16,409
really isn't because this internet costs 75% less than the internet that I had

1585
04:29:16,409 --> 04:29:26,649
before it it is it is a almost a hot 200 fucking dollars less expensive than the

1586
04:29:26,649 --> 04:29:44,159
one that I had in the other house that I was in what a perfect time I can I just

1587
04:29:44,159 --> 04:29:48,549
kill this guy I did this guy's are so annoying it's not why even fight these

1588
04:29:48,549 --> 04:30:08,610
guys pretty good frame drop timing yeah for some reason sometimes twitch just

1589
04:30:08,610 --> 04:30:13,709
genuinely hates wherever my traffic is coming from and I have to server hop

1590
04:30:13,709 --> 04:30:16,909
until I find one that lets me stream on it for a week and then I do it again

1591
04:30:17,389 --> 04:30:23,479
bro I pay 90 for gigabit where I am but that's what I mean I used to have to

1592
04:30:23,479 --> 04:30:30,889
have like this crazy business internet to get over I believe it was 10 to 20

1593
04:30:30,889 --> 04:30:42,340
upload which was fucking unbelievably stupid why do you stream at a low bit

1594
04:30:42,340 --> 04:30:46,059
rate if you're paying for fiber is you can't scream to twitch past 6,000 bit

1595
04:30:46,059 --> 04:31:08,200
rate they'll literally turn your stream off is the Titan is that the Titan no

1596
04:31:08,239 --> 04:31:15,840
it's not that's the thing we've already fought that that's not the Titan right

1597
04:31:15,840 --> 04:31:26,479
we just bought that thing take this to the clerk's office at the shadow it's

1598
04:31:26,479 --> 04:31:36,700
really wet where he is walking he's walking through like sludge why his shoes

1599
04:31:36,700 --> 04:32:13,120
filled with water I got the Bible all right where's this Titan nice all right

1600
04:32:13,120 --> 04:32:27,129
it's definitely right here I'll get to you in a minute actually let me buy a

1601
04:32:27,129 --> 04:32:39,389
bunch of health potions oh that's interesting you can buy these make sure

1602
04:32:39,389 --> 04:32:47,469
you don't lose them that's cool all right I need to buy this what do you

1603
04:32:47,469 --> 04:32:54,670
have to say what's wrong be not afraid I am NOT a member of the royal army you

1604
04:32:54,670 --> 04:32:58,909
like the game new to the stream I intend to put an end to it yeah I think it's

1605
04:32:58,909 --> 04:33:05,709
fun I don't think it's as hard as some of the souls games or some of the other

1606
04:33:05,709 --> 04:33:09,069
souls likes but it's definitely enjoyable it's a fun experience I think

1607
04:33:09,069 --> 04:33:15,349
good I will not hurt you you can believe me

1608
04:33:15,349 --> 04:33:21,000
combat's fun I'm afraid it's too late madam those whose bodies are strewn

1609
04:33:21,000 --> 04:33:25,959
about this square paid the ultimate price for their blind trust like me they

1610
04:33:25,959 --> 04:33:29,680
believed in their country in the National Guard and they were urged to

1611
04:33:29,680 --> 04:33:33,759
join he believed in the marketer Lafayette was to lead them to victory

1612

04:43:40,200 --> 04:43:48,520
fun this nightmare you were throwing grenades at this guy you owe your

1633
04:43:48,520 --> 04:43:54,400
freedom to the good habit I tell you this man is utterly irreplaceable he

1634
04:43:54,400 --> 04:43:58,479
has devoted himself body and soul to the mission I entrusted to him

1635
04:43:58,479 --> 04:44:02,840
investigating the King's entourage in particular the man who enabled him to

1636
04:44:02,840 --> 04:44:09,040
create this ungodly army I just made a YouTube video just cutting at the end of

1637
04:44:09,040 --> 04:44:15,759
sentences like dude you took a lot of takes to do that captured monsignor I

1638
04:44:15,759 --> 04:44:22,279
was with a big record in plasticine we've gone to speak with the volunteers

1639
04:44:22,880 --> 04:44:30,290
we implored them not to take our arms against the King's machines alas they

1640
04:44:30,290 --> 04:44:35,290
refused to eat our words and we had to leave in great haste after that

1641
04:44:35,290 --> 04:44:44,669
what do you I can't remember a thing those poor people these are automats

1642
04:44:44,669 --> 04:44:51,830
were truly made in the mold of their master ruthless to think for just one

1643
04:44:51,830 --> 04:45:00,029
simple reproach against the court the king cast me into hell what nightmare

1644
04:45:00,029 --> 04:45:07,880
monsignor it was terrible I was shadow we try to move away from the fire that

1645
04:45:07,880 --> 04:45:14,869
would be probably good idea has been you put they put you in there 20 minutes

1646
04:45:14,869 --> 04:45:22,680
ago there were flames everywhere only been 30-40 minutes

1647
04:45:26,680 --> 04:45:31,720
that awaits our immortal source once our time on this earth has ended if this is

1648
04:45:31,720 --> 04:45:37,799
true then how are we to go on living with nothing to hope for nothing to

1649
04:45:37,799 --> 04:45:47,799
believe it but you the notes what notes monsignor the notes the abbot placed in

04:54:02,639 --> 04:54:06,560
want my fine okay my final first impressions of this game that was fun

1689
04:54:06,560 --> 04:54:16,409
that was actually a pretty fun game I enjoyed that is it a 10 out of 10 no is

1690
04:54:16,409 --> 04:54:21,669
it a 5 out of 10 no is it a 6 out of 10 no it's higher is it an 8 out of 10 not

1691
04:54:21,669 --> 04:54:29,250
sure is it a good game yeah that was fun I think it was worth playing I would have

1692
04:54:29,250 --> 04:54:32,729
stopped if I didn't think it was good it was pretty fun I liked it I think it

1693
04:54:32,729 --> 04:54:36,990
probably gets a little bit more interesting a little bit later maybe is

1694
04:54:36,990 --> 04:54:41,590
it a 7 it's like between depending who you are someone between like a 7 and an

1695
04:54:41,590 --> 04:54:48,889
8 something I don't give ratings on this stream there's no way that's an 8

1696
04:54:48,889 --> 04:54:55,279
come on Gwen I'm I just I didn't say that this is it okay the game with how

1697
04:54:55,279 --> 04:55:00,200
do you rate a game the game was clean the animations were clean combat was fun

1698
04:55:00,200 --> 04:55:07,729
the bosses are a little easier than I would have liked only saw four of them

1699
04:55:07,729 --> 04:55:16,000
though I don't know how long the game is I thought it was fun there's definitely

1700
04:55:16,000 --> 04:55:18,000
enough there to be interested this definitely seems like there's enough

1701
04:55:18,000 --> 04:55:21,479
weapons the weapons are awesome it kind of remind me of blood-borne where

1702
04:55:21,479 --> 04:55:27,770
they're very cool and very different and the difficulty up I could it's pretty

1703
04:55:27,770 --> 04:55:33,009
cheeseable yeah but whatever I mean you don't have to play it like that I let

1704
04:55:33,009 --> 04:55:40,310
me go get Otto that was steel rising it's on steam was kind of fun I would
