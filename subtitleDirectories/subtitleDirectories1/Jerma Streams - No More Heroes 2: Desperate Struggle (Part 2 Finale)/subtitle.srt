00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:18,219
Good afternoon, hi hello everybody. You know how much your turnips are? I know.

2
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,739
Okay, you know what? No, I do know. My turnips every day are worth

3
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:32,869
12, 10 bells for a stack. So you don't want to, my island sucks. You don't want to come to visit my,

4
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:38,810
they're worthless. See? And they're worthless every day. 12 bells a stack. Yeah, it's bad.

5
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,740
So now people don't need to know. Don't come to me.

6
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:56,570
Does that like shove the fucking gold bars under the bed? My turnips are worthless. He's got...

7
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:09,530
Yo, Jerma. Yo, hey. Is he playing No More Heroes? Yo. Yo. Yes, how are you? I played it yesterday.

8
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:19,319
Were you here yesterday? I'm probably at like the 40%, 30% point in the game.

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,659
The idea is to try to finish this today. And if I don't, then we'll finish it tomorrow

10
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:38,629
and do something else after it's done. I had to go early yesterday. Is the cat still a fat boy?

11
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:47,219
Uh, well, you'll see. So here's the plan. Here comes the remainder of the week. I'll give it to you.

12
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:54,489
No More Heroes 2 tonight. Trying to finish it tonight. If I finish it tonight, then I'm playing

13
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:02,579
Resident Evil 3 Remake tomorrow. Hopefully finishing that in one stream too. On Thursday,

14
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,449
if that's the case, I beat this today, beat Resident Evil 3 tomorrow. And on Thursday,

15
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,610
we're going to get a special treat of Tiny Toon's Wacky Sports and maybe one other Super Nintendo

16
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:25,669
game of my choosing. Now this plan falls apart if I do not beat this tonight. If I still have

17
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:31,270
another two, three, four plus hours of content in No More Heroes 2, then I'm going to play it

18
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:38,199
tomorrow. And then when it's done, gauge the environment and see if there's enough time for

19
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:46,069
me to do Tiny Toon's Wacky Sports and then do Resident Evil 3 on Thursday. Or potentially

20
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:52,629
the start of the next week. I'm not sure yet, but Resident Evil 3 will happen. We'll see.

21
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:00,520
Don't stall and start. That's been three minutes. We need every moment to make sure you can beat

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:11,110
this. Every single second counts today. Dude, every second counts today. All right. All right.

23
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm ready. Oh, he's stalling. I'm not stalling. It's been four minutes. Don't make me put on the

24
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,870
anime. I will. All right. Let's go. He caught us. He hasn't been here since yesterday.

25
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:47,210
We're No More Heroes 2. This is the sequel. I tried that. Wait, didn't I? Oh, right. I opened

26
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:53,560
it once and said, no, I'm done. Okay. I remember. I'm going to do, how much money do I have?

27
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm ready for the next mission. Love this series, bro. Yeah. I can't wait for the third one.

28
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:15,669
Oh, I forgot you can press B. Wait, who was that?

29
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,209
I read the tweet and thought it was Neo 2. No, not Neo 2.

30
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,009
Hey, that's true. The paper boy's a genius. Does anybody else feel like if you stood in

31
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,529
one of those, it would just make you shit? Anyway, I'd have to go to the bathroom in five

32
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,490
minutes after that happened. It's just shaking you and vibrating all your intestines and stuff.

33
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,370
Yes, the association resorts to this when there isn't much activity in the rankings

34
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,610
or when there are too many strong fighters or sometimes when we just get bored. If you're like,

35
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,769
Jerma, I'll give you $10,000 if you drink a full coffee and stand in one of those for 12 minutes

36
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:06,410
and not have to go to the bathroom. I'd probably lose. If you win, you'll jump to the 10th rank.

37
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,970
Damn, that's a twisted way to do things. You agents are becoming as fucked up as the killers

38
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:20,649
you rep. Oh, we've always been fucked up as you say. We just we like fortnight. You guys

39
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:26,329
fucked up assassins working with fucked up agents. Doesn't get any better than this.

40
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:33,300
Mature streamer. I'm just keeping it on permanently. No doubt. I'll kill them all in a flash.

41
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,029
I put that on for the drug stream and then I never took it off and I'm never going to take it off.

42
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:55,540
Okay, so we got ranking battle. Let's go. Oh, destroy man. Wait, is destroy man in this?

43
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:05,459
Is he? I don't remember. Is it actually destroy man?

44
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,500
I don't know why. In my brain, she's playing hand simulator. That's like a hand simulator setup

45
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,620
to dial the phone number. Why am I thinking that?

46
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,360
He's trying hard not to talk about. No, I'm fine.

47
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:56,939
Damn, is it my turn yet? Anybody work here? This is taken forever. Open the gate so I can kick some

48
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:16,870
ass. What's that meme? Did it work? Connect the legs. Somebody do it. The game is stalling.

49
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:26,600
What is your sense of suggest carnage? This guy who is my next victim? Question.

50
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,399
Surprise task. You are identified as Travis touchdown.

51
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,199
Luck is an irrational concept, but your presence defies probability. Do you remember me? Question.

52
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,670
I do. He died last game. I don't know who or what the fuck. Wait a second.

53
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, yeah, you're that fifth ranked freak Henry sliced up before I got the chance to.

54
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,120
It's going to happen again, right? It has to. Affirmative. After near fatal decimation,

55
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,360
I had no choice but to take this modified form. Looks to me like you just gained a few pounds.

56
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,759
Hardware was affected, but my pride was not. With determination levels maximum, I thought only of

57
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:20,199
winning. It was meaningless, futile, illogical. But such is the curse of being run by a human brain.

58
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:30,069
That brain also makes you talk about desert. Why is that always funny shit? But if you want to

59
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:40,070
take it out on me, go ahead. All I desire is a duel with you. Desire level 100%. Revenge on primary

60
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:49,830
target was previously accomplished. So Henry makes a cameo before fighting you. I elected to

61
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:57,350
defeat formally top ranked assassin as practice sequence. This was same individual on whom I

62
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:05,590
also desire vengeance. Efficient turn of events. Do you agree? Would you shut up? I just need to

63
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,230
make one thing clear. I'm not going to kill you because of Henry. I'm going to kill you

64
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,870
because your big metal ass is in my way. I love that saver. Activating main engine.

65
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,909
I already know this routine. We actually do have to fight it.

66
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:40,700
That was quick. Is it going to be a maze? I hope not. Pretty fast for a tin can. Now it's my turn.

67
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,279
Shit, we actually fight it. I thought it was going to be another joke.

68
00:09:44,759 --> 00:10:01,960
Activating engine. Let's go. Half is the floor. Okay, that hurt a lot. That almost instantly

69
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:13,669
killed me. All right. Oh, this is safe. This is a safe spot. Okay, I get it. The ones that don't move.

70
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:39,580
Come here. Oh shit. I got to go get on that one. Where are we going? Oh shit, this is not going to

71
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:54,200
work out, is it? Holy shit, this thing is powerful. Okay, easy, easy, easy. Stop,

72
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,600
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Find a good spot to stand. Where, where, where, where, where?

73
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:11,399
Oh, wait for him to move. Wait for him to move. What's this? What's that?

74
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,960
Jesus. Okay, I can dodge that, I think.

75
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:25,500
Oh, it says I don't like this. I don't like the extreme explosive noise that pops up.

76
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:43,299
Come here. I'm safe right next to him. Yes. All right, this ain't so bad. This ain't so bad.

77
00:11:43,299 --> 00:12:08,919
Don't be an idiot. Okay, easy. Wait. Okay. Oh God. Oh God. It's not safe.

78
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:20,789
Oh, it hit me in the face. That wasn't safe. It got like the corner of my mouth.

79
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:37,340
Oh fuck, did I dodge it? I think so. I don't know. It sliced off my nose.

80
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:54,259
Just move. Just move. Where's he going? Oh God. Oh God. I know, I say it a lot. Okay.

81
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:11,100
Okay. This is safe here. I need that health. All right, where's the health? There's a health box.

82
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:38,950
Fine. Oh my God. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm not okay. Shake everything. Shake

83
00:13:38,950 --> 00:14:00,659
everything, right? Okay. How are you missing? What? Okay. I'm fine. Oh, he tried to get me with a

84
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:12,279
dive. I can't make it. It's so hard to deter me, man. It's so scary. All right. Is he going to move?

85
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:30,059
All right. I'm good. Bang. Again. Nope. Easy.

86
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:52,019
I'm too scared. I'm terrified of that. All right. Is he going to fly forward?

87
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:59,100
Is he going? Nope. He's going to do it right there.

88
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:28,789
Again. Again. All right. One more time. Don't move. Is he going? This is it. I win.

89
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:54,539
Okay. I'm fine. Game over. Boss dead. This is a scary one. Scary one for those disgusting sounds.

90
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:07,610
That was just me opening my mouth and closing it to talk. I just didn't do it.

91
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,840
What is it? Okay. I don't even know the origin of this. I don't even know what this is,

92
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:52,330
but I've seen it. Hey, it kind of worked, I guess. Master. It's been a long time.

93
00:16:53,210 --> 00:17:01,220
Shinobu. How did, wait, what did you say? Did you call me master? I don't have time for apprentices.

94
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,269
You have any idea how much pro wrestling is backlogged on my VCR? I came to tell you I got

95
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:13,480
back safely from Asia. You should be happy. I didn't even know you left. It's the lore.

96
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:21,769
I'm not your master. My only desire was to become strong like you, master. So I trained hard

97
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:29,130
and I thought to become the champion of Asia. Here's my belt. No way. You won this? That's

98
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:35,930
pretty badass. When I get married, I'm not getting a ring. I'm getting a championship belt

99
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:42,819
that you have to wear forever. Me? Overburdened? Who told you that? Sylvia. She said I should come

100
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:50,549
back and help you. What? Who's that bitch think she is? My nanny? Listen up, Shinobu. This is my

101
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:56,710
war. I don't need help from anybody. Well, the thing is, it's kind of too late for that.

102
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:04,150
What are you talking about? But isn't her arm gone yet? I'll explain later, master. But you

103
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,990
should go to the bathroom first. Seriously, it's a long story. We're going to get a lore dump.

104
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:28,579
But I'm not your goddamn master. We're going to get a lore dump. Oh, we went from 23 to 10.

105
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:39,000
Looks like we skipped a few. Oh, yes. It's that time again. It's time to activate the one guy

106
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,630
squad and tell them to play God Hand. Did you pay attention? No. Not at all. Sorry. Somebody says

107
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:59,660
it about God Hand. Yeah, I'll play it. July 30th or something. Something, something. July 30th.

108
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:08,420
Sorry for interrupting your time abroad, but will you fight for Travis? Sure.

109
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,779
I'm eager to kill, so hurry with the details. Straight to the point. I like that. Can you handle

110
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:21,460
two of our top ten? Two? Only two? That's nothing. Why don't I just take them all?

111
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,339
You've grown confident. Yeah, but not overconfident. Unlike you, I can see myself

112
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:39,460
objectively. Easy, vague, never. Don't forget your promise. What are you talking about?

113
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,750
I already gave you a hard date for that. You're not worth the stain on my blade.

114
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:56,970
That's just bad steel. Staining your blade. You must not have a fucking Kathy Mitchell copper pot.

115
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:11,210
Wait, that play is her. Jump. Hold A then release. Long range. Press A while jumping.

116
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,660
Jump attack. Press B while jumping. Flying attack. Oh, they've added a jump. That's all it took.

117
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:28,500
Let's do a long range attack. Well, that was fucking awesome. Can I play with this character

118
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:58,500
the rest of the game? Whoa. I took cash from the toilet. Small F. Emulated. Small F, that's my fault.

119
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,859
Don't worry. It's always my fault. Blame me for everything.

120
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:20,490
These quick slashes. Oh, I mean, yeah, I got a VPN. Come on VPN. So

121
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:26,920
that's to make, you know, it makes sense. Don't worry. It ain't gonna, this, this stream ain't

122
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:32,039
gonna, it's not gonna like turn off and not gonna fucking lose like 10,000 frames. It's just,

123
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:43,460
I'm going through a, if you ever heard of the term called a VPN, B E E P I A N VPN.

124
00:21:46,339 --> 00:22:00,569
Designed to help with like traffic flow and where's this other person? Where is this person? Oh,

125
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:16,539
there you are. Can't go through the window. Damn it. All right. Long range, right? Let's go.

126
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:25,660
I want to do it. I'll do it. I've, this move is cool.

127
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:57,509
What is she saying? You have no moe? Are you fucking with me? Moe. Oh, it's moe.

128
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:13,079
Where's the last guy? Oh, there's a chest over here. Apologize for saying moe. Is that a word

129
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:18,279
that nobody wants me to say? That added to the banned list of words that streamer can't say.

130
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,920
There you are. Wait, you just were here, but now you're not here.

131
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:50,730
You just were here, but now you're not here. There you are. Meester. You're not even close

132
00:23:50,730 --> 00:24:07,019
to meester. Holy shit, that was loud. This is like every roommate scenario when they're playing

133
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:20,039
Counter-Strike and you can hear them through the wall. Like dude, settle down, man. Dude,

134
00:24:20,039 --> 00:25:02,599
he's kicking my ass. Dude. God. Cano wins. This fucking screen. It's like, dude, just,

135
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:08,759
I know, input lag sucks. That's why I don't play online video games that have precise inputs,

136
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:31,819
because it's like a quarter of a second delay. That's why I don't play them. People just keep

137
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:55,019
spawning. I'm going to get some blocks in here. That was sick. Long range. Bingo. Here comes a

138
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:59,220
bingo. I was listening to your stream when you were playing No More Heroes 2 and you did this

139
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,579
thing where you said bingo, bingo, and I fucking hated it. I couldn't get out of my seat.

140
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,299
See you next week when somebody sends that as a message. What's going on with the voice here?

141
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:25,220
That was weird. Somebody was in the middle of typing it, I'm sure. Well, this looks fun.

142
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:47,660
Sneak through. That was easy. She had another weapon. Just one weapon. She got one weapon.

143
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:05,660
The one-time thing, so no. Fuck it. Fuck it.

144
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:26,119
Shiva. No, she sent some gifts. That was awesome. There's money in here? Holy shit. That's a lot of

145
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:40,950
money. All right. Watch it. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Good. Pizza. Oh, it's a chainsaw guy.

146
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:52,009
Don't even let him. Oh my god. I tried to dodge. All right. Back up. Stop taunting. She gets up

147
00:27:52,009 --> 00:28:42,009
and goes, you have no moa and I can't control it. Attack. Whoa. She says that every time.

148
00:28:43,049 --> 00:29:01,779
You have no moa. Kill. Apologize. What's it mean? What's it mean? What does that mean when I say that?

149
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:15,190
What is moe? What's the word mean? It means you're not, it's you're not cute?

150
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:30,890
The anime term for cuteness. I thought that was kawaii. I thought kawaii was anime cute word. Same

151
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:43,160
thing. Oh, so what would, what would make somebody say moe over kawaii? What does kawaii have that

152
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:58,779
moe doesn't or the other way around? I have no idea. Okay. Thanks for the help guys. I could

153
00:29:58,779 --> 00:30:24,390
rely on you in anime terms. Come on, get it. No, this is a Reddit chat. Um, I don't think it is

154
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:39,640
unless you're all pretending to hate it. Unless you guys really actually love that site and

155
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:47,720
you're pretending to hate it. Okay. I can't lock onto that. Uh, what can I go over to there?

156
00:30:49,829 --> 00:31:11,420
Oh, that sucked. Is there another way to get up there? Okay. Yeah, I just,

157
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:19,130
apparently just didn't do it good enough. Just didn't do a good enough job. Just don't,

158
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,690
please. Did somebody learn from Gotcha Force and have the camera be in the right place? Gotcha

159
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:37,960
Force did it. Why can't everybody else do it? Well, I've, how did you miss? Do I actually have

160
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,460
to make this jump? I'm not going to make it. I told you. Like I wasn't, it's weird. It's

161
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:52,519
fucking weird. That's like a fucked up weird. I told you it's odd. It does. It's okay. I feel

162
00:31:52,519 --> 00:32:24,599
like I'm crouch jumping in the source engine. That's how this feels. God. Okay. Where's the

163
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:43,799
last one? Oh, I see it. I see it. I see it. I see it. I can't. Oh, this is going to be in the ass.

164
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:59,130
I already said anime sucks. Whatever. I'm not even going to address that.

165
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:13,480
Unbelievable. I'm not even going to fucking address that. If you're going to the bathroom

166
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:28,069
in the shower, this is like the go to the bathroom save point. Wait, he showers and he shits. How

167
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:36,700
come he never takes a bath? Hey, thanks Ben for the five community subs. Appreciate it. Five subs

168
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:46,700
from Ben Eldor. Ben, welcome to the German mites. No, actually I get that. I screw up the way that

169
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:59,940
I say that usually the first or second time I did it right that first time. I'm going to hate this

170
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:13,019
fight. Who's there? Sorry, but I got to make this quick. Golden gun. It's a young girl. If you kill

171
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:21,769
me, you can fight Travis, but that's a huge it. You talk a lot of trash for a child. Let's get to

172
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:56,760
the fun. Done. Okay. I'm not going to go easy on you just because I fuck you. I'm not going to fuck you.

173
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:57,800
Come to this.

174
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:10,170
Where did he go? There he is. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it. Walk it.

175
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:49,130
Holy shit. Come here. All right. Spring it together. Walk it. Fuck you. Why does everybody say

176
00:35:49,130 --> 00:36:05,820
fuck? Walk up. Walk it. Oh, fuck. Walk. Walk. Walk. How many did he shoot? He shoots one,

177
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,380
two, three, four, five. Why can't I walk up the stairs? Hey.

178
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:43,269
Hey. This guy's nuts. Oh, fucking platforming. Oh, it's not designed. This game wasn't made for

179
00:36:43,269 --> 00:37:01,219
this. I knew I was going to not like this part. I'm not going to go easy on you. He's freaking me

180
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:11,500
out. How did I not make that jump? That's just so wary. All right. It's one, two, three, walk.

181
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:44,949
This fucking thing up, man. Where? I don't even know. Where's the camera? Did he say money? I love

182
00:37:44,949 --> 00:38:00,760
money. Is he below me? Okay, block. I'm not blocking. Oh, that's right. She taunts after

183
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:55,449
every attack I've got. Good. What are you not going to do? Don't jump over him. Dodge better

184
00:38:55,449 --> 00:39:04,760
than anybody. Why is it not blocking? I'm blocking up. What the fuck are you doing?

185
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:43,030
Block. Block. Drop him. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Fuck. Why did I not block the other ones?

186
00:39:44,070 --> 00:40:10,730
Where is he? You don't have anything else but two voice lines. Where even is this dude?

187
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:26,059
He's down here. It's what? Seven shots? One, two, three, four, five, six. I'm down one, two, three,

188
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:47,940
four. I don't even have the 50% health, man. It's almost trouble. Try to get in front of it.

189
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:54,869
Don't even let him shoot. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him shoot a gun.

190
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:15,340
All right. Don't even let him shoot the gun. Suplex him. But you don't have any moves. She doesn't

191
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:24,630
watch wrestling. Really? Okay. I know the strategy. It's just don't let him attack.

192
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:34,730
Yeah. What are you talking about? She won the championship belt. She should know.

193
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:50,469
Okay. We got this in the bag. Don't let him get any shots off. All right. Get up there quick so I

194
00:41:50,469 --> 00:42:03,800
can... Okay. What? You have to fucking wonder. You have to wonder. You have to take into

195
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:19,909
consideration the fact that this... Why? No. Don't eat that pizza. I better not get hit.

196
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:41,849
Oh, my fucking God. You got to be kidding me. Don't let him shoot. Don't let him. Don't let

197
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:49,210
him. Don't let him. What are you going to do about it? What do you think you're going to do?

198
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,010
He's stuck. He's stuck. He wants to shoot me so bad, but he's not going to ever.

199
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:12,789
He's not going to... Don't let him shoot you. Don't let him do it. He's so confident.

200
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:22,550
He's not... I cheese. I cheese. Spread it. You don't know anything about wrestling, I guess.

201
00:43:23,510 --> 00:44:01,260
I broke him out of his spell. Store up. Another Counter-Strike roommate. No more heroes, too.

202
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:18,070
Desperate Counter-Strike. That was way easier than it would have been. No Moe heroes.

203
00:44:32,949 --> 00:45:13,719
I can't talk. Come on. Oh, he's speaking. That's not how that works. Laughing my ass off.

204
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:31,190
What? Yeah, that's what I asked. Wait, she doesn't even know what it means?

205
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:53,289
Says it every five seconds. She doesn't even know what it is. That's so funny.

206
00:45:53,289 --> 00:46:02,840
It's this bishop's grave. Yeah. Who's this? Were you friends? Yes. We never met in person,

207
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:09,000
but we knew each other well. We exchanged many letters even though our countries and

208
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,599
languages were different. That's like a fucking knife on his back. That's a big, huge sword.

209
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:24,039
I am very much indebted to him. He gave me courage. Oh, I'm just rambling. Don't mind me.

210
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:32,039
By any chance... Do you know his best friend, Travis? Of course. Excellent. In that case,

211
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:40,440
would you please give this to him? It is from Bishop. This? It is a lot of things, I suppose.

212
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,159
Knowing it is your hands, I can have peace of mind.

213
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,159
That looks like a type of shitty luggage you'd buy on Sky Mall trying to save space.

214
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,719
Thanks. I promise to deliver it. It fits under the seat.

215
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:07,110
Yeah. Shinobu, the next match is ready. On my way. This better be good.

216
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:31,110
Wait, is this the match? The rocket launcher. I wonder what it is. Oh, outdoor. Outdoor zone.

217
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:53,079
What you got there? I didn't see the second guy. He thought it was just one guy. Wait.

218
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:59,860
Secret. Can I get up there? Or is it... Do I eventually get over there?

219
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:17,989
I think I eventually get over there. Okay. On the ground. Kill now.

220
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,889
Why did he walk like the heavy? What do you mean?

221
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:33,699
Both of us are having trouble.

222
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,920
Yes. This ridiculously high streamer can't even do a Tetris puzzle.

223
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:14,889
Fucking yesterday. Everything opened up Tetris. What are you talking about?

224
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:28,460
I thought I could tell before I got out of the car. Now that would have been epic.

225
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:46,550
Everybody's so vulgar. Everybody just screams fuck.

226
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:54,219
When are you going to do a cigarette smoking stream?

227
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:06,090
What? I just said they're in smoke? What the fuck would the point of that be?

228
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:22,860
I didn't even know you... There's no reason why he would smoke on stream. Let alone smoke

229
00:50:23,739 --> 00:50:33,860
in real life. Another carload of people.

230
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:44,420
I'm going to smoke every brand of cigarettes and let us know what the best one is.

231
00:50:45,300 --> 00:51:01,130
A guy that's never smoked cigarettes before in his life. You want to do a cigarette smoking

232
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:07,579
first time impressions channel. Like guys, I'm not going to... This is not opening Breath of

233
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:14,679
the Wild for 10 minutes and then writing a review about it. That's not how this is going to work.

234
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:24,119
Because then I hope I will... I'll get addicted to smoking cigarettes. I don't want to smoke

235
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:48,300
cigarettes. That's gross. Do it. You got to be cool. No, sorry. The only thing I think is

236
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,989
fucking cool is a McDLT dance. Nothing else is cool. I'm sorry. You're wrong.

237
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:09,349
Okay, boomer. Wouldn't the boomer be the one that had the cigarette in his mouth right now?

238
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:25,400
Me having a don't smoke stance. Guys, you would know I was a boomer if I would be smoking in my

239
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:39,019
house right now. Like cigarettes in the house. Not like, oh no, I'm going to step outside. No,

240
00:52:39,019 --> 00:52:48,920
no, no. I smoke in my office. There's no face game to prove that you aren't smoking. I'm not.

241
00:52:51,260 --> 00:53:05,320
Wait until he stands up. Make it embarrassing. I missed a lot of money.

242
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:15,769
Can I go over here? Is there the... Look at those chests. Do I eventually get up there?

243
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:28,619
I don't want to miss the chests. Oh, I think I wrap around in them.

244
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:53,639
All right, here we go. Over this way.

245
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:31,449
I'm wearing heels. Stupid. Okay, where are those... I got to go pick up all the junk over here.

246
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:55,159
Just on top? Where are these two? Where are these two? Oh. What are you going to do about it?

247
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:04,119
This guy's freaking me the fuck out. I'm just going to go. Wait, no, I got to go down every hall.

248
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:15,239
Oh, this is going to be a pain in the ass, but I have to do it. There's money in me.

249
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:27,579
Can't tell if that's faster or slower. It's probably slower. Charge is a... Charge is...

250
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:39,639
Oh, fuck. That's awesome. Thank God you told me that. Cash. Good.

251
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:51,699
Who snitched? That makes all of our lives easier because I don't sit here for more than like

252
00:55:53,159 --> 00:56:01,239
more time than I need to. What do you mean who snitched? Can I get there from here?

253
00:56:13,929 --> 00:56:17,960
Please don't have to kill those guys. Do I have to kill those guys?

254
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:29,400
Yeah, I got to kill those two guys that were standing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

255
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,949
Don't smoke. Stop. Why would you smoke? Why smoke? Don't do that. What are you talking about? Don't

256
00:56:36,949 --> 00:57:10,889
smoke. Oh, I can go. You smoked CBD oil. No, I didn't. Sorry. The proper use is a tincture.

257
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:31,880
A tincture? Tincture? Okay, this is where we go. It's getting so bad. Did anybody play this

258
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:50,019
when they were in the middle of making it? Wait, now I'm back. No, go over here.

259
00:57:55,659 --> 00:58:02,170
Now I'm turned around. Wait, what? Is this the right way? It's all the same fucking car.

260
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:29,130
Oh my goodness gracious. This is the reason why Legend of Zelda never had a fucking jump.

261
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:42,579
It would be this awful. Dude, let me walk across the board. It's this camera.

262
00:58:44,889 --> 00:59:10,380
Stuff changing. Holy shit. I can't do an attack because I'll fall off the fucking roof.

263
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:29,030
Shinobi levels are low key awful. I mean high key. Like, sing it as high to pitch as you can.

264
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:36,230
Like, see, like, I'm just trying to walk fucking straight. Like, what the fuck?

265
00:59:46,840 --> 01:00:04,179
Where's the stupid trucker I can get up? Oh my fucking god. Like, this is like,

266
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:12,869
high pitch break the windows high key awful. Not low key. Low key would be, no, this is like,

267
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:41,099
where the fuck am I going? Why did I go this far? I can't wait till I get the jump deleted

268
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:46,440
from the game. That happens like immediately after this is over, right? And we never have to

269
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:53,480
do this again. Like, I mean like instantly. We don't get a jump, right? Ever again?

270
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:20,250
Okay, let's walk across the bridge. Okay, please. Don't like shift the camera.

271
01:01:46,940 --> 01:02:08,980
Don't go off the edge. I'll be so mad. Don't, Jesus. Turn another bridge.

272
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:18,760
Don't fucking fall off. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's, it is, it is

273
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:38,409
fucking bearable. Holy shit. Oh my god. Can I jump up from here? Where do I go this way, right?

274
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:56,139
Is it over here? Where the hell is it? I'm on those. It's right fucking here.

275
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:26,440
Ugh. How do I forget? I'm not forget, I'm just insanely angry. Holy shit. You've got to be

276
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:47,050
fucking kidding me. This is harder than crouch jumping in the fucking source engine. Dude,

277
01:03:48,090 --> 01:04:14,679
this has been, what a fucking journey to cross, to cross a bridge. Okay. I can't turn the camera

278
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,360
and even in the tiniest little movements make you fucking go frantic in this game.

279
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,639
Like, what the fuck are you doing? They're deliberately trying to make me fall.

280
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:47,780
Bakitu, get on it. What are you doing? Don't even go over there.

281
01:04:50,519 --> 01:05:00,550
Can we fucking fight somewhere else? Because I see edge. I don't want to fight on the edge.

282
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:32,170
The edge is guaranteed to fall off the fucking edge. Don't move. Hit that chest. Wait, is that

283
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:39,619
bridge over here? No, no, no, no. Don't do this again. I got to just jump over here.

284
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:08,650
I almost didn't make it. I almost didn't make it. Oh my god. I don't want to be facing like this.

285
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:18,230
It's going to happen. I'm going to be so slow. You have no idea. Let's hug the fucking wall.

286
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:45,079
Hey, we're good. Holy shit, that sucked. Suda. What the hell was that? Suda. Suda wasn't in on

287
01:06:46,039 --> 01:07:06,199
the Rectus one. Oh, so this is the Dark Souls 2 of the franchise. Oh, well, that's all right.

288
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:14,170
It's still fun. I still like it. I just don't like this part. I don't like the jump. I don't like it.

289
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:23,000
Send it back. Send it back. Return it. Dark Souls 2 is good. I didn't say it was bad.

290
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,960
I just said it was the Dark Souls 2 of the game.

291
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:36,809
The Dark Souls 2 also was not made by the same director, right? He kind of took a little hands

292
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:46,219
off approach, right? What do I remember? Why does he hate this? Am I supposed to be doing this right

293
01:07:46,219 --> 01:08:05,059
now? I'd love to look down. Press the C button. Yeah, that just spins the camera. Yeah, if I was

294
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:09,699
doing that on the bridge, that'd be bad. It would rip the camera. Then I would walk the wrong direction

295
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:27,670
for a tenth of a second to fall off the bridge. Another one here? There's probably another one

296
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:41,140
right here somewhere. Wait, is this a truck stop bathroom? Why does it look like this?

297
01:08:41,859 --> 01:09:12,010
It's like the nicest random warehouse bathroom ever. All right, let's go. Why doesn't she shit?

298
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:26,149
I don't know. Why do you want that to happen? Why do you want anybody to shit on a camera?

299
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:35,369
What do we have here? A young lady? You know, it's dangerous coming to a place like this alone.

300
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:41,909
You ought to be more careful. Seriously. Terrible things can happen. I see it on the news all the time.

301
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,720
Maybe that's why she came. It's what she wants. Two grown men to keep her company.

302
01:09:54,119 --> 01:10:00,119
Horny slut. My master's got his hands full, so I'm taking his place. Not that it matters.

303
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:05,000
The results are going to be the same. I don't have time for this. You're taking Travis's place?

304
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,180
Wow. I got to say, I'm feeling pretty disrespected. Just shut up and fight. Listen to this

305
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:17,340
whore. Acting like she's some kind of femme fatale. Shut up and fight, she says. She's really

306
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:23,340
kissing me off. Seriously. And she's so rude. Reminds me of my complaining customers. Now,

307
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:29,579
Travis, he knew how to fight like a gentleman. Slice me in half, sure, but he did it with grace.

308
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:37,590
Come on. Put her there. Don't do it. You know, let's shake hands. Sportsmanship is paramount

309
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:48,149
to a fair and clean fight. Hurry up and shake. Dirty nympho. Whatever. But which one? It doesn't

310
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:59,899
matter. Your choice. The one that's throbbing. I kick, I kick, I kick. Destroy Spark. What the?

311
01:11:00,859 --> 01:11:03,739
What? Was this supposed to spark?

312
01:11:07,579 --> 01:11:10,619
I really have to fight two at the same time. This is going to be terrible.

313
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:21,829
Enough with your freak show. Now bring it. Oh, boy. And his jumping involved. Oh,

314
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:39,899
he's already mad about it. Your scoot is dead. Watch it. Watch it. Don't get greedy. Watch out.

315
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:50,460
What are you doing? Where's the other one? The other one. What's that thing? What's it floating?

316
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:59,460
I'm just going to focus on one.

317
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:26,460
Get me out. Destroy Spark. Go hide him. All right, go get the other one.

318
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:37,050
No, fight this one, I guess. The other guy's just raining hell on me.

319
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:47,829
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh, headshot.

320
01:12:50,630 --> 01:13:04,840
Take it. All right, he's about halfway. I got to get out of this corner before I get killed.

321
01:13:10,869 --> 01:13:30,859
Where's the health? There's a health box somewhere. Spark. Watch out. Where is it?

322
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:55,699
Leave me alone. I need health. Where is it? There's a box. Where is the box?

323
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:22,979
Where'd he go? What? The other guy can't hit me. Oh, that's unfair. He didn't even do it.

324
01:14:23,859 --> 01:14:50,779
Hey, come on. What's with the fucking turn? All right, watch it. Watch. He's going to do moves.

325
01:14:51,819 --> 01:15:26,340
Destroy Spark. Do it. Whoa. Where did he get me? Spin, spin, spin, spin. I'm doing it. What's

326
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:36,279
happening? He was shooting at me. I have no idea what happened. I guess I was behind the cardboard

327
01:15:36,279 --> 01:16:15,659
boxes. All right, get back over here. I'll block that. Get behind the boxes. What are you doing?

328
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:44,649
Dude, it's making me fucking mad. It's making me mad. He's dead. Only one more asshole and I win.

329
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:31,539
Fuck. What's he doing? Hey, what is this? Did you just revive him? Wait a second.

330
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:44,979
They both have to die at the same time. Are you kidding me? They have to die at the same time,

331
01:17:45,699 --> 01:18:17,909
but now I have to. That's so unfortunate. There's health up here. If only I could get it.

332
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:30,859
I'm not going to make it to the pizza.

333
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:54,779
No. Do I got anyone left in me? No. Oh, goodness. Okay. Well, I don't, I have to,

334
01:18:54,779 --> 01:19:28,649
they both have to die within like the same time. Soybeans? That's not what he's saying.

335
01:19:29,609 --> 01:20:03,779
That's what you deserve. You deserve that. Stop it. That was a wave. He dodged backwards.

336
01:20:04,819 --> 01:20:29,100
I'm trying to get you to stay in the way of all his attacks. All right, hit him right in the fucking

337
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:46,890
head. What? You're just doing destroy beams the whole time. Get that shit. Get that smash

338
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:53,659
from this bullshit tactic out of here. Playing in a Hyrule castle. This fucking person playing

339
01:20:53,899 --> 01:20:58,220
Samus just sits there and presses standard B across the map. Let him play the game.

340
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:35,880
You refresh Twitter more than you've played. Don't let him do it. Can I interrupt this?

341
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,199
Oh my God. Oh my God. I don't think I can. Can I interrupt it?

342
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:56,470
I need the health. I need health one. You seriously just spin around and hit me with that?

343
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:11,239
That's next level homing missile dude. Come on. Oh, come on.

344
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:24,359
I can't even get the fuck out of here. I'm going to die from this.

345
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:45,529
All right. Where's the, where's it? I don't even think about it. You fucking asshole.

346
01:22:45,529 --> 01:23:18,170
All right. Oh my God. Is it safe back here? Is it safe right here? Hey,

347
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:39,020
holy shit. It hit him. It hit him. It hit this guy. All right. Kill this guy and then spawn camp his

348
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:58,199
body. Don't let him do it. All right. What are you going to do? Are you going to land?

349
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:12,380
I don't think so. Motherfucker. Hey, get out of here. You're not going to revive this guy.

350
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:32,409
No, you're not. I'm not going to let you do it. Not going to happen. What's that? Don't let him

351
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:42,250
revive him. No, no, don't do it. Please. No. That thing was homing for like 30 straight seconds.

352
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:49,220
You need more practice. How long can you have a device follow you the fuck around?

353
01:24:49,220 --> 01:25:08,069
I've got to kill them before they get this off. Dude, I don't know. What the

354
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:25,260
fuck is happening in this fight? Holy shit. I'm going to fucking cry. This is horrible.

355
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:39,220
All right. Come here. You shoot a fucking homing bomb out. Why? Why does it take you so long to

356
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:44,979
finish that animation? Oh my God. I'm almost done with it. I'm almost done with it.

357
01:25:46,020 --> 01:26:08,149
I'm almost done with it. He's directing the third one, right? Are we certain of that? Do we know

358
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:36,380
that? Do we know that for sure? Are we certain? God, I hope so. What is he doing? This guy's freaking

359
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:57,079
me the fuck out. Hey. I'm going to go up there to try to fight him. He's going to come revive

360
01:26:57,079 --> 01:27:05,899
this motherfucker and I'm going to scream. Here he comes. That's my chance. Get out of here.

361
01:27:06,779 --> 01:27:15,079
Get out of here. Go ahead. Fly away. I do need that fucking help though.

362
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:42,949
Where is he? Get out of here. I'm just scaring him away. Okay. I have to make a move.

363
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,880
He wants me to make a move so bad to come down and do this. I got to make a move.

364
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:16,170
Fuck out of here. This is stupid. This is stupid. Okay. This is stupid. This is stupid.

365
01:28:39,960 --> 01:29:02,300
Don't do this. Don't even think about it. Get out of here. Where is he? Go off.

366
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:12,890
This is going to take forever. This is going to take forever. I have to get in there and fight

367
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:41,829
him. I can't just do this. This is dumb. I have to fight him. Holy shit. You let me heal. What a

368
01:29:41,829 --> 01:30:18,680
fucking asshole. Go get him. Okay. I'm ready for him too. He's going. He's going. Go, go, go, go.

369
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:31,210
Go. Here he comes. Let him come over here and do that again.

370
01:30:31,210 --> 01:31:14,899
Get the fuck out of here. Get away. Get out. All right. Now we play safe. I'm not fucking around.

371
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:36,149
He's going to hit his head right in the pole. All right. We're good. I'm going to follow him

372
01:31:36,149 --> 01:32:08,630
this time. Oh, he's going to get it. He's going to get it. Settle down. It's all right. Settle

373
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:38,439
down. Which way is he going? I'm going to get up this way. I don't want to. Now we kill him.

374
01:32:48,619 --> 01:33:14,279
Go this way. One last shot. I win. I don't win. I don't want to ever do this again.

375
01:33:14,279 --> 01:34:34,310
Okay. Holy shit. I can do a better one than that. What do you think? Should I go a little

376
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:48,649
bit more with the throat? No. There it is. I'm going to get demonetized for saying

377
01:34:48,729 --> 01:35:01,930
MonkaS. Well, that's a MonkaS scenario. And that's how I took them out. Destroy Man came back.

378
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:09,050
Didn't see that coming. He was an annoying prick though. I'm glad he's dead again. I can kill more

379
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:27,529
fighters for you. Whatever my master wants. I'll give me the game back. Master. Pesky little cub.

380
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:44,229
You can't kill me. Eat this. Must be having a nightmare. Hey, over here. I can't. That's how

381
01:35:44,229 --> 01:36:03,979
close you can get with VR helmets on. I'm sorry. You can really count on her. The rest should be

382
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:21,130
easy now that she has done her part. Yeah. Wait. Something wrong? Nah, it's nothing. I like that

383
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:40,680
cactus. The next sucker's all mine. Oh, I'm about to be done with it. Let's go, Gene.

384
01:36:57,079 --> 01:37:11,050
Holy shit. That was 171 centimeters. That was insane. What the what? You're so good now.

385
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:34,949
That's got to do it. Close. Not punching anything. I'm not punching the cat. We're doing squats.

386
01:37:45,260 --> 01:38:01,289
Big junkers. Junkers. Junkers. It's not even like that funny, but it is. It just is.

387
01:38:08,039 --> 01:38:34,819
Big. Oh my God. That's funny. Old record beaten. All right. 14 pounds. Let's play.

388
01:38:35,619 --> 01:38:52,810
That was close. Come here. Nice. That was a whole pound from a bro. Travis Touchin was literally

389
01:38:52,810 --> 01:38:58,010
me. Like LOL. We both have the same bleak nihilistic outlook. It was deleted. Probably

390
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:29,000
rightfully so. Now we feed the finest quality cat food. 13.9 pounds. Good. Oh, this is the present.

391
01:39:29,079 --> 01:39:49,670
The beam katana is how much that beam katana rose nasty. I don't have to spend any money on it.

392
01:39:49,670 --> 01:40:09,350
Let's go see if we can speak in a money. It's been a while. We did like two or three missions

393
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:16,199
in a row. Let's go check out what we can do. You know what I mean? Like three pog moment here.

394
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:30,869
No, no more mini games. Well, I mean, how am I supposed to make money? I need money for the gym

395
01:40:30,869 --> 01:40:42,949
and money for the lab. Look, I'm just going to do some... This is playing. This is how you make money.

396
01:41:27,609 --> 01:41:39,380
I fucked it up. This is going to go like this. Wait, where does this go?

397
01:41:42,420 --> 01:42:20,659
No, don't go like that. I ain't about to sit there. CVD brain. Don't feel bad, son. You're

398
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:43,960
just bad at the game. I'm definitely older than you. I say, son. That was your fucking dad. What

399
01:42:43,960 --> 01:43:07,609
the fuck? What's this? Sorry, dad. Why did I not go in? Soy cigarette brain. You guys come up with

400
01:43:07,609 --> 01:43:25,060
just new terms every day. What's he today? I don't know. He's a Jolly Rancher horse manure

401
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:44,810
screamer. I'm glad I see. I see one true in there and it makes me fucking happy.

402
01:44:05,369 --> 01:44:17,619
It is true though. Jolly Rancher Reddit brain.

403
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:52,500
I did that one pretty cleanly. I didn't get hit by any of the meatballs. Made air. I guess you

404
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,100
could bring them all up here and just let them go, but I don't know if I want to do that.

405
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:23,189
No, I'll try it. I don't even want to give this attention, but no, I'm not even going to.

406
01:45:26,329 --> 01:45:43,699
What the fuck? Let me out. What was it? I don't know. Maybe you'll figure it out.

407
01:45:44,739 --> 01:46:03,909
It was just a dumb comment. How much money is that? Let's see if I can do it. 28,000. All right.

408
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:35,529
Let's go see if we can upgrade. What do you got? Man with dumb comment. You have nothing?

409
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:47,020
Do you ever have anything else? Two items so far the whole game? Not even like parts or anything?

410
01:46:54,390 --> 01:47:15,659
It was just one $300,000 purchase there. That's it. This one's going to be really hard.

411
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:24,439
This is going to be the second hardest. It's $10,000. I don't want to blow this.

412
01:48:17,479 --> 01:49:11,380
Dude, the game can't even register you pressing it like that. I better have done it. Wait, I can

413
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:34,310
do a no. Oh no. Back to back. This one's $12,000. Oh, I didn't know that. He has a spam now.

414
01:49:35,270 --> 01:50:15,739
Good enough, right? Come on. Yes. This one more isn't there. Good. Okay. Tell that Wendy's story.

415
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:21,140
One time I went to Wendy's and I got a fucking big chicken. It was good. The story's over. I

416
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:51,560
don't have any Wendy's story. Tell us the story. Tell us that story. That was a quick change. Come

417
01:50:51,560 --> 01:51:08,939
on. Don't do that to me. That means it'd be another one for this, right? I'm almost a max. Oh yeah.

418
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:20,949
There's only is one more level of this. Both of them. At least I spent all my money.

419
01:51:21,989 --> 01:51:29,539
Okay. Here we go. This one's not hard. It's probably going to get real hard soon here.

420
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:57,819
Whoa. Faster. Don't accidentally run off. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

421
01:51:57,819 --> 01:52:08,420
Describe day one with Otto. It was a wonderful thing. Picked him up. He was sitting in my lap.

422
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:21,020
He put his head in my armpit and it was the cutest thing ever. He just stuffed his head in my armpit.

423
01:52:21,659 --> 01:52:28,140
He was hiding. It was like safe for him. You know, it was so cute. Like, oh, okay. You can do that.

424
01:52:28,939 --> 01:53:04,250
Okay. What about clothes? This is one of our new jacket. Nerd. How is this? Is it pens?

425
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:24,489
I'll take it. Okay. There's a nerd pants. Wait, why is this nerd? Do they have knee pads?

426
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:56,760
I need more money. I'll be back. Yeah. I'm going to do the other missions.

427
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:59,319
Elbow pads too. He's being protected. That's fine.

428
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:23,670
Kill all enemies within the time limit. This is not the new Sabre though. What's the new Sabre?

429
01:54:30,390 --> 01:54:49,579
Dual Welding. It's a dual welder. Okay. Let's go. Pretty cool. Bam. This corner.

430
01:54:50,380 --> 01:55:00,659
It's aggro everyone. Later. I'm going to be able to do the movement. I'm going to cut all their heads

431
01:55:00,659 --> 01:55:37,340
up. Somebody's health go to zero? No, zero. Peony back out.

432
01:55:41,079 --> 01:55:50,470
The range of this is too small. Let's take out, let's take out a real Sabre.

433
01:56:04,899 --> 01:56:07,539
Maybe I shouldn't have aggroed every enemy.

434
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:21,319
Why these guys have so much health? He's just default enemies. Holy shit.

435
01:56:22,840 --> 01:56:50,300
Bring it on. I'm going to need that health.

436
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:07,210
Who has the guns? Who's just spamming? Who has the spam?

437
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:35,579
Hopefully I do this in the time limit. I have 14 seconds to kill three people.

438
01:57:36,300 --> 01:58:01,899
This is the last person. What? It was the final person. I was trying to target something.

439
01:58:02,619 --> 01:58:20,140
There's nothing there. It was you. Okay. Well this time I'm going to use the actual weapon

440
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:31,449
I should be using. This is the good one. Three, two, one, zero. Hi.

441
01:58:31,449 --> 01:59:28,600
It's too violent. Sorry.

442
01:59:33,029 --> 01:59:34,949
What's the range? It's the best item in the whole game.

443
01:59:35,670 --> 01:59:42,180
It's just, I saved up. That's what we did all scream yesterday. It was me doing minigames

444
01:59:42,180 --> 02:00:15,880
to make $300,000. So we did yesterday. We went for a spawn or? Oh 15. Use Rose Nasty on the boss.

445
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:22,420
Yeah, I'll use it. Just for something like this. You got to kill them quick.

446
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:45,779
How much was that for? Rose Nasty does a lot of stagger, especially if you dark step.

447
02:00:45,859 --> 02:00:49,640
I'll give it a try. I'm going to use it. I'm going to put it on.

448
02:00:50,359 --> 02:01:13,859
The East had a brute strength or deadly weapons or gimmicks. It subdues all enemies with the

449
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:22,569
sheer force of its will. And fighters who wield this clash, the battle is epic. They see it in

450
02:01:22,569 --> 02:01:31,000
each other and form it becomes test of their souls. Yeah, it's fine. Maybe someday we'll be

451
02:01:31,000 --> 02:02:04,970
the spectators of such a battle. All right. Can I, uh, there's a motorcycle fight.

452
02:02:05,689 --> 02:02:22,869
This, I, I'm going to, I want the whole nerd outfit. We actually are on the motorcycles.

453
02:02:23,430 --> 02:02:29,510
No, we're not. Wait. Yes, we are. Accelerate. Brake. Nitro. Steer.

454
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:53,319
How far was this gulch? So far. Holy shit. You can see the water. They weren't this high up.

455
02:02:55,060 --> 02:03:04,710
Let's do this. Of course. The obvious fall joke. That's going to happen.

456
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:13,319
Unironically, a thousand times. What are we supposed to be doing? Is this a race?

457
02:03:25,779 --> 02:03:30,220
Wait, this is smart. It's Mario party. It's a Mario party game where you're going to be

458
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:33,979
Yoshi. You got to like bump into people until they fall off. Right. All right. I'm ready.

459
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:51,380
What? The trigger, the event is close. I'm going to fucking watch this. He's going to

460
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:59,510
go right off the edge. It's going to be perfect. Let's go. Ready? Oh yeah. I was the best at Mario

461
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:22,439
party. Okay. Follow me. Let's do this. What's wrong? I did the nitrous mixes. You can't turn

462
02:04:22,439 --> 02:04:33,479
very well. It's not funny. You're right. That's not funny. It's not. Look at how huge of a turn

463
02:04:33,479 --> 02:05:10,859
that is. Did I get him? Okay. Here we go. Almost. Hold on. Let's do this. You're making this fight

464
02:05:10,859 --> 02:06:02,300
so lame. Back the fucking car up, dude. He's got a fucking wall. That's not fair. Wait.

465
02:06:03,579 --> 02:06:17,930
Hey, that turn. What the fuck? They've made this in dreams.

466
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:30,550
You don't drift with a back tire and then fly forward. I'm going right in. Let me just go.

467
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:43,979
And then get him to turn this way. Oh, come on. I just road-runnered him and it didn't work.

468
02:06:44,779 --> 02:07:06,520
Try to leave? Can you? Can I? Okay. Can I leave? Can I? Nope. I can't.

469
02:07:07,079 --> 02:07:46,010
It's payback time. Okay.

470
02:08:21,479 --> 02:08:39,720
You're not getting trouble from that. He's invulnerable. Don't drive off.

471
02:08:40,359 --> 02:09:00,279
That's what I'm talking about. Back in the action. It feels like it should be at times two speed.

472
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:07,829
That's seven times. Let's get minus two. I'm not.

473
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:28,699
I'm using Nitro. I'm holding Z. Let's do this. Veto this game. No, I can't. No.

474
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:58,819
I can hit him when he's revving. No, I can't. Watch. Hey. Turn. Turn. Turn all the way. Turn.

475
02:09:58,979 --> 02:10:19,829
Oh, okay. Not even fair. Not even fair. I can't. It's payback time.

476
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:36,420
Okay. How many? I don't know. Nine. I have to gift sub-server. No, that doesn't work. Come on.

477
02:10:37,300 --> 02:11:07,060
Hey. It hurts a lot. I can't even do this. Let's go. It's hard to control. I could give you every

478
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:12,579
excuse in the book. It's fucking weird, man. I don't know what's going on. Half this game is

479
02:11:12,579 --> 02:11:19,479
just weird shit that they threw it for some reason. This is it. I'm going to get it right here. I just

480
02:11:19,479 --> 02:12:02,739
won. Oh, actual phase is real fire. That's fine. That's a cool saber. If I die, do I have to restart

481
02:12:02,739 --> 02:12:42,500
at the... You see? Oh, I dodged it too. That was so much greed. Not even funny. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

482
02:12:42,500 --> 02:13:09,859
Charge. I'm almost out of battery. All right. Battery time. How far does it go?

483
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:29,979
Time out. We got him. I should try to dark step that, shouldn't I? That would be sick if I did.

484
02:13:30,699 --> 02:14:21,779
Nope. Whoa. Do I run from that? It's still out. Shit. She's low. Oh, fuck. Here comes that snake

485
02:14:21,779 --> 02:14:43,029
thing. He's just out of reach. Give me this weapon. Give me this thing. Thanks for letting me close.

486
02:14:45,289 --> 02:15:22,949
I don't understand how dark step works. Jesus. Battery. Doing it twice in a row.

487
02:15:23,670 --> 02:15:35,720
Damn it. Come on. Oh, my. You have to do this three times in a row. You mother fucker.

488
02:15:36,920 --> 02:16:18,569
No. Bring back the peony. It's decisive. Look at the boxes. Just give me... Please pick it up.

489
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:41,100
Dude, I don't think the camera's been facing the right direction since like three days ago.

490
02:16:41,979 --> 02:17:32,729
Do it. Easy. Don't stop. Stop. Stop. Come here. Oh, more. More. More. More. More. Give me more.

491
02:17:35,079 --> 02:17:51,079
More. More. More. Oh, no. He's getting careless. Oh, shit. I'm getting so careless.

492
02:17:51,319 --> 02:18:05,500
Damn it. Oh, I got so careless. This battery in this. Oh, god. This is bad.

493
02:18:19,319 --> 02:18:28,100
Hey, we're good.

494
02:18:41,290 --> 02:19:02,379
I win. I'm trying to skid. No more QTEs.

495
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:08,600
Oh, my.

496
02:19:21,899 --> 02:19:30,069
Why you beat him? He had nothing left. I know that. Jesus. That was fucked up.

497
02:19:30,069 --> 02:19:38,069
This is not some Pewee Karate tournament, Travis. You do not say bow and go home. You are an assassin.

498
02:19:38,069 --> 02:19:44,069
And killing is how you win. But I thought what? He fought honorably so he'd work a little bit.

499
02:19:44,069 --> 02:19:49,510
So he can come back stronger and cut you in half. You are developing a bad habit.

500
02:19:49,510 --> 02:19:54,469
First, that dumb schoolgirl. Oh, yeah. I'm supposed to pee. Just finish the job,

501
02:19:54,469 --> 02:20:11,049
or we will do it for you. These fights are not a sport. Shit. All right. It's pee time.

502
02:20:11,049 --> 02:20:19,000
I'll be back in two minutes. Unless there's no cut scene. All right. I'll be back after you get

503
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:34,010
to see this part. I mean, this part. Start the clock. Yeah, that'll take me two minutes.

504
02:20:34,729 --> 02:23:44,219
Get back. Flush first.

505
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:55,239
Is this guy still in the bed?

506
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:15,209
What the hell?

507
02:24:26,329 --> 02:24:30,969
Your thoughts? Well, you gave them to me. That doesn't make any sense.

508
02:24:31,610 --> 02:24:39,739
I was hoping you'd wander around some more. Explore. Yes, you. You did not want to go back.

509
02:24:39,739 --> 02:24:44,620
So you reached out to my consciousness instead. Now we are one. Let's go.

510
02:24:44,620 --> 02:24:51,899
Got you fourth. Away with you. I said be gone. You should stay here forever. No way.

511
02:24:52,620 --> 02:25:02,809
We live together. I'll never leave. I'm going back. If you want to go, no choice.

512
02:25:02,809 --> 02:25:07,290
Why don't you come with me? You like it. I have a weapon. I know you're trying to trick me.

513
02:25:08,329 --> 02:25:25,299
Congrats, Jerma. You now have to fight Ayaya. Oh, yeah. He's got the Kylo Ren saber.

514
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:30,260
Attack. Dash. Hold A, then release for long range.

515
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:39,450
This is the Bloodborne character? That's a dash. I like it already.

516
02:25:40,729 --> 02:25:53,620
If you don't... Oh, beam. Oh, I missed.

517
02:26:00,010 --> 02:26:17,430
Whoa, I can't even... Where's the beam? I just got... Oh, I got slapped. Oh, come on.

518
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:59,979
Is there health in a dream? Get in there and slash. What happened? What, I have like a magician ball?

519
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:49,829
Wait, how many... Whoa, this move is good. He's Sony. I'm probably just scared so much.

520
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:57,079
That was like you just dropped food on the ground and like an animal went to go get it.

521
02:27:57,079 --> 02:28:26,979
Like, no, no, no, hey, hey. Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop. No, I'm not. What am I chewing?

522
02:28:29,049 --> 02:28:34,739
I'm not chewing anything. I'm getting way too greedy with this bullshit.

523
02:28:35,459 --> 02:28:52,469
Go back to the tried and true arcade missile. Okay, now we have to fight. No, we don't.

524
02:28:52,469 --> 02:29:25,079
All right, going for the kill. Don't chew tobacco. That was not a...

525
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:42,780
That was like a knight. Oh, that was a knight. That was very clearly a...

526
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:48,620
Like, I'm a knight and I have a big suit of armor on.

527
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:51,659
A tournament. That was not what you think it is.

528
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:07,940
Are you the one who rescued me? I had a fight to win. You were just collateral damage.

529
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:10,500
Watching the video. So get out when you can manage it.

530
02:30:12,309 --> 02:30:15,030
Until then, I've got some good shit on video.

531
02:30:18,459 --> 02:30:32,069
We'll see about that. I'm watching.

532
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:54,549
Close my door. I'm watching anime. That's when your mom walks in.

533
02:30:54,549 --> 02:30:58,389
Forgive your big brother who's too much of a shitebag to thank you face to face.

534
02:30:59,030 --> 02:31:02,069
You're the big brother? How do you know I didn't pop out first?

535
02:31:03,829 --> 02:31:08,790
And the point is, there's no honor in getting rescued by my younger, big brother.

536
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:14,870
So I took it upon myself to proper kill Scott Gardner, Greg Cantrell, and Massimo Bellini.

537
02:31:15,510 --> 02:31:19,829
You've gotta be kidding me. Would you fucking people stop stealing my kills?

538
02:31:19,829 --> 02:31:24,950
This makes us even. As far as the rescue goes, you and I still have a score to box off.

539
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:26,469
That's another subject entirely.

540
02:31:27,110 --> 02:31:28,309
K-K-S-ing.

541
02:31:32,809 --> 02:31:37,370
Damn it. Irish ass. He could at least have told me more about those assassins.

542
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:41,209
And in case you were wondering, I took pictures of the three skankers as souvenirs.

543
02:31:41,209 --> 02:31:42,649
How long is this message?

544
02:31:43,530 --> 02:31:47,690
I feel like I could do it. When I do an accent like this, you guys scream at me.

545
02:31:49,290 --> 02:31:50,979
Please come out and I'll sleep.

546
02:31:52,819 --> 02:31:55,059
I'd probably make good wallpaper for you.

547
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:59,239
I'm fine. Well, I've got a lot of things to say. I'll hang up now.

548
02:31:59,799 --> 02:32:00,680
Long message, isn't it?

549
02:32:01,239 --> 02:32:02,360
Good boy.

550
02:32:09,399 --> 02:32:10,280
You're Irish, though.

551
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:13,219
Um, gotcha.

552
02:32:13,219 --> 02:32:20,379
Why would I speak with an Irish accent if my ancestors are from Ireland?

553
02:32:21,899 --> 02:32:22,700
I'm not from there.

554
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:32,569
I was born, like, what?

555
02:32:33,209 --> 02:32:37,430
Dude, this dude's Irish. He can't even do a fucking Irish accent.

556
02:32:38,309 --> 02:32:40,069
Ha ha, is that even possible?

557
02:32:49,739 --> 02:32:50,620
Freddie Dredd.

558
02:32:50,620 --> 02:32:52,139
Freddie Dredd saved $200.

559
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:54,940
When did you do this? Like two minutes ago?

560
02:32:56,200 --> 02:32:57,079
Holy shit.

561
02:32:58,219 --> 02:33:00,620
That's $220,000 of this.

562
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:03,260
That's $200 bucks, Freddie.

563
02:33:04,059 --> 02:33:08,969
Freddie, you showered me with money.

564
02:33:09,770 --> 02:33:11,399
It's a lot. Thank you, dude.

565
02:33:13,459 --> 02:33:15,540
And they say it was a very clear night.

566
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:16,819
Uh-huh. See? Thank you.

567
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:21,299
Just like how every time I go, ay-yai-yai.

568
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:23,940
Or like, ay-yai-yai-yai.

569
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:26,180
It's not like, oh, he's doing that thing. I hate him.

570
02:33:26,180 --> 02:33:26,680
Burn him.

571
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:28,120
Punch him.

572
02:33:31,780 --> 02:33:34,500
I go like, ay-yai-yai.

573
02:33:35,219 --> 02:33:40,540
I don't have any money.

574
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:45,989
But Freddie, thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.

575
02:33:50,389 --> 02:33:51,989
Cat, cat. I don't have any money for the cat either.

576
02:33:51,989 --> 02:33:52,870
I need to do side jobs.

577
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:55,000
Which one is it going to be?

578
02:33:55,639 --> 02:33:59,909
And which one do I want to do?

579
02:34:00,629 --> 02:34:05,579
Coconut Grabber.

580
02:34:06,139 --> 02:34:16,569
Don't play the minigames?

581
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:20,020
I'm not playing the minigames for fun.

582
02:34:20,020 --> 02:34:23,059
I'm playing the minigames because I want to make money.

583
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:26,940
I'm not just, like, going to the arcade.

584
02:34:32,340 --> 02:34:33,620
I thought about having fun right now.

585
02:34:33,620 --> 02:34:35,059
It's about how much money can I make?

586
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:40,500
And look, the dollar signs are going up.

587
02:34:43,590 --> 02:34:44,090
Four.

588
02:34:55,819 --> 02:34:58,979
Oh, I didn't save it.

589
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:06,780
Oh, you motherfucker.

590
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:22,090
My fucking finger slipped.

591
02:35:22,729 --> 02:35:23,530
It still worked.

592
02:35:24,329 --> 02:35:38,200
Let's catch it.

593
02:35:38,200 --> 02:35:39,319
And this one's going to explode.

594
02:35:51,479 --> 02:35:52,120
I like this one, though.

595
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:52,680
This one's fun.

596
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:54,750
Really?

597
02:36:08,549 --> 02:36:09,049
Got it!

598
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:20,219
How much time?

599
02:36:27,059 --> 02:36:27,559
Pow.

600
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:32,170
Pow!

601
02:36:32,309 --> 02:36:42,739
I'm trying to get...

602
02:36:42,739 --> 02:36:49,530
I got 20,000.

603
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:55,139
I want to see the speedrun for this shit.

604
02:36:55,139 --> 02:36:56,659
It's probably so ridiculous.

605
02:36:57,700 --> 02:37:01,879
That didn't go in.

606
02:37:01,879 --> 02:37:06,010
Come on.

607
02:37:09,530 --> 02:37:10,809
Get in the basket.

608
02:37:14,579 --> 02:37:14,979
I got it.

609
02:37:14,979 --> 02:37:15,479
Okay.

610
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:17,139
The scorpion was freaking me out.

611
02:37:17,940 --> 02:37:33,020
Faster.

612
02:37:49,290 --> 02:37:49,930
Damn it!

613
02:37:49,930 --> 02:37:51,530
I can't do it.

614
02:37:51,530 --> 02:37:52,729
I tried to get it.

615
02:37:52,729 --> 02:37:58,620
It's redeemed the German Wink.

616
02:37:58,620 --> 02:37:59,180
Oh, shit.

617
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:00,860
They're almost at 15.

618
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,579
What do I do?

619
02:38:02,540 --> 02:38:05,799
One more bullet.

620
02:38:11,530 --> 02:38:12,409
They got it.

621
02:38:12,409 --> 02:38:13,049
They got it.

622
02:38:17,659 --> 02:38:19,020
15 out of 15.

623
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:19,819
Are you kidding me?

624
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:25,290
Oh, man.

625
02:38:25,290 --> 02:38:25,790
Okay.

626
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:28,489
I didn't think you guys are going to do that.

627
02:38:30,239 --> 02:38:31,200
You surprise me every day.

628
02:38:32,079 --> 02:38:42,840
I've got to give you your reward.

629
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,079
See that shit?

630
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:06,969
And go.

631
02:39:14,510 --> 02:39:15,069
Oh.

632
02:39:15,069 --> 02:39:17,290
Out of my way.

633
02:39:23,389 --> 02:39:23,889
Nice.

634
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:25,040
All right.

635
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:26,159
What did you guys want me to wink?

636
02:39:26,159 --> 02:39:27,760
Oh, my webcam's not plugged in.

637
02:39:30,989 --> 02:39:31,790
It's not plugged in.

638
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:32,670
And if I plug it in,

639
02:39:33,469 --> 02:39:35,229
it might break the computer.

640
02:39:36,270 --> 02:39:37,469
That sounds like a lie.

641
02:39:37,469 --> 02:39:37,950
I know.

642
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:40,190
I know that sounds like the worst lie you've ever heard in your life.

643
02:39:40,829 --> 02:39:41,709
If I can assure you,

644
02:39:42,670 --> 02:39:44,430
if I will break my computer,

645
02:39:44,430 --> 02:39:45,629
if I plug this in,

646
02:39:46,270 --> 02:39:52,969
send a picture to us.

647
02:39:52,969 --> 02:39:53,770
I could do that.

648
02:39:54,329 --> 02:39:55,290
I think I might be able to do that.

649
02:39:59,659 --> 02:40:03,079
I got to get this.

650
02:40:03,079 --> 02:40:04,440
This is $14,000.

651
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:05,239
I got to get this right.

652
02:40:05,239 --> 02:40:06,520
This is the hard one.

653
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:07,959
The hardest one in the game.

654
02:40:32,590 --> 02:40:44,760
Got to be it.

655
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:45,399
It's got to be it.

656
02:40:45,399 --> 02:40:46,280
That's got to be it.

657
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:49,149
Don't ever doubt me ever again.

658
02:40:49,149 --> 02:41:01,469
That's the last attack power upgrade.

659
02:41:01,469 --> 02:41:04,840
And then we've got the final stamina upgrade.

660
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:12,750
Wink.

661
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:13,250
Hold on.

662
02:41:19,069 --> 02:41:20,750
You know, I'm going to be here for another couple hours.

663
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:21,309
You know that, right?

664
02:41:21,309 --> 02:41:21,709
At least.

665
02:41:22,670 --> 02:41:23,899
I'll be here.

666
02:41:23,899 --> 02:41:24,620
I can do it soon.

667
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:28,030
You know, I could do it on July 30th.

668
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:32,440
The next wink will be on July 30th, probably.

669
02:41:33,559 --> 02:41:34,680
Kind of plan this stuff out.

670
02:41:35,399 --> 02:41:49,530
Good job.

671
02:41:54,139 --> 02:41:55,420
Time for the mission to begin.

672
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:00,190
I did want to get the nerd pants, though, didn't I?

673
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,000
Cat.

674
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:02,559
Oh, yeah.

675
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:03,600
I'll get the cat.

676
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:13,549
What do you get for putting the cat back in shape?

677
02:42:24,590 --> 02:42:25,469
A healthy cat.

678
02:42:26,809 --> 02:42:27,309
Gene.

679
02:42:30,459 --> 02:42:30,959
Good jump.

680
02:42:33,370 --> 02:42:33,870
Let go.

681
02:42:34,329 --> 02:42:45,020
I need a bigger one than that.

682
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:45,520
Gene.

683
02:42:48,079 --> 02:42:48,399
Yeah.

684
02:42:48,399 --> 02:42:49,200
That was a big one.

685
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:54,250
That's the biggest one so far.

686
02:43:00,280 --> 02:43:01,079
0.4 pounds.

687
02:43:03,020 --> 02:43:03,520
Stretch.

688
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:16,879
Enormous weight loss.

689
02:43:31,610 --> 02:43:32,809
You're lifting with your back.

690
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:35,200
Looks like it.

691
02:43:36,159 --> 02:43:39,760
And our big chunky.

692
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:41,840
12 pounds.

693
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:45,440
I'm going for record.

694
02:44:18,889 --> 02:44:19,610
12 pounds.

695
02:44:22,670 --> 02:44:31,020
The whistle sounds like someone's trying to stop me.

696
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,459
Like, get my attention.

697
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:37,370
Like I stepped out of bounds or something.

698
02:44:37,370 --> 02:44:39,979
I'm like, come here.

699
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:44,360
There's a soccer ref back there.

700
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:45,479
Being like, that's a foul.

701
02:44:45,479 --> 02:44:46,360
That's a foul.

702
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:47,000
That's a foul.

703
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:47,559
That's a foul.

704
02:44:47,559 --> 02:44:48,200
That's a foul.

705
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:48,760
That's a foul.

706
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:50,840
You know, I don't have enough cards for this.

707
02:44:58,190 --> 02:44:58,690
Premium.

708
02:44:59,389 --> 02:45:03,979
All right.

709
02:45:03,979 --> 02:45:05,260
11.6 pounds.

710
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:06,459
That's good, right?

711
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:12,090
I don't want the cat to be too thin.

712
02:45:22,959 --> 02:45:25,920
Wait, I have to look at the shelf to learn these?

713
02:45:26,799 --> 02:45:33,229
Belly to back waist.

714
02:45:33,229 --> 02:45:42,649
Well, I got a lot of moves to learn.

715
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:44,959
Finally noticed.

716
02:45:54,299 --> 02:45:56,059
Put the cat to negative 25.

717
02:45:57,260 --> 02:45:58,540
I don't know if that makes any sense.

718
02:45:59,739 --> 02:46:10,319
We got a whole game of moves here.

719
02:46:20,860 --> 02:46:22,299
Damn, I really didn't do any of these.

720
02:46:23,020 --> 02:46:28,219
Shown weight to the cat is extra weight that you need to remove,

721
02:46:28,219 --> 02:46:29,579
not the weight of the actual cat.

722
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:32,639
What?

723
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:38,110
So you tell me this cat was supposed to be 40 pounds?

724
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:40,909
45 pounds?

725
02:46:41,709 --> 02:46:45,129
I don't think that's true.

726
02:46:45,850 --> 02:46:48,590
All right, let's save this.

727
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:56,969
You have to get the cat under 10 pounds.

728
02:46:57,690 --> 02:47:02,840
Okay, do the mission.

729
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:15,290
8 to 10 pounds is average.

730
02:47:16,569 --> 02:47:22,540
Cat should decide their lifestyle.

731
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:29,500
Rank four.

732
02:47:30,219 --> 02:47:33,520
Herd pants?

733
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:35,040
I will after this mission.

734
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:42,360
Take a seat.

735
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,440
There's something I want to talk to you about.

736
02:47:45,469 --> 02:47:46,430
Another rule change?

737
02:47:47,229 --> 02:47:48,829
No, it's about Henry.

738
02:47:49,469 --> 02:47:50,750
I want to clear the air.

739
02:47:51,309 --> 02:47:51,629
Why?

740
02:47:52,959 --> 02:47:54,479
We are divorced now, you know?

741
02:47:54,479 --> 02:47:55,920
I don't remember Snake on those things.

742
02:47:56,559 --> 02:47:58,079
I don't want to hear any of that shit.

743
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:02,319
The last time when you and Henry fought each other?

744
02:48:03,899 --> 02:48:07,020
Snake was the only game that we could play on our old cell phones.

745
02:48:07,819 --> 02:48:10,540
It was a huge deal who had the best Snake account.

746
02:48:33,149 --> 02:48:33,549
Shoes.

747
02:48:37,629 --> 02:48:37,870
Have.

748
02:48:40,399 --> 02:48:41,120
So what?

749
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:43,280
You want revenge, right?

750
02:48:44,159 --> 02:48:46,479
Your opponents could not care less about that.

751
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:54,409
Once I'm number one, these bullshit ranking fights are over.

752
02:48:54,409 --> 02:48:54,809
Got it?

753
02:48:55,530 --> 02:48:57,049
Assassins aren't tools.

754
02:48:57,049 --> 02:48:58,729
As fucked up as we might be.

755
02:48:58,729 --> 02:48:59,770
We're humans too.

756
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:10,200
Until No More Heroes 3.

757
02:49:14,569 --> 02:49:15,530
Ranking battle.

758
02:49:16,250 --> 02:49:21,049
It's time to go.

759
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:25,979
Need pants.

760
02:49:25,979 --> 02:49:26,620
Need pants.

761
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:30,379
I don't deserve the nerd pants until I can be a nerd.

762
02:49:31,100 --> 02:49:34,940
I can beat this without any problems and without any huffing and puffing.

763
02:49:36,299 --> 02:49:37,180
What I mean by that is...

764
02:49:37,739 --> 02:49:38,540
I don't even understand.

765
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:39,260
What is this?

766
02:49:40,059 --> 02:49:40,620
What the fuck?

767
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:41,659
This is dumb.

768
02:49:41,659 --> 02:49:42,780
This is stupid.

769
02:49:42,780 --> 02:49:43,180
None of that.

770
02:49:43,819 --> 02:49:44,780
No huffing and puffing.

771
02:49:46,520 --> 02:49:47,639
I don't deserve the nerd pants.

772
02:49:47,719 --> 02:49:48,280
Out of my way.

773
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:59,399
Get out of my way.

774
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:26,680
Coming out.

775
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:32,299
I wanna do a new wrestling move.

776
02:50:32,299 --> 02:50:32,780
For you.

777
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:35,469
Oh

778
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
He was queuing it up

779
02:50:45,079 --> 02:50:56,979
Awesome. This is the best weapon. Why would I take this off? I spent good money on this. Why would I ever remove it?

780
02:51:17,020 --> 02:51:27,639
All right guys who's gonna gun gun guys gotta go you got a gun you gotta go

781
02:51:37,899 --> 02:51:39,899
Oh

782
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:53,760
Then we get to collect all the trinkets only a few more

783
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:11,760
That's an instant kill it's so good

784
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:31,469
There it is no more enemies

785
02:52:51,659 --> 02:52:59,579
30 minutes. Oh, I don't

786
02:52:59,579 --> 02:53:06,879
Know

787
02:53:13,959 --> 02:53:16,559
Rejectile you aim it at Travis

788
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,680
No, this is literally 30 minutes long

789
02:53:50,290 --> 02:53:56,819
I need to get some of these presents

790
02:53:56,819 --> 02:54:02,319
I

791
02:54:41,180 --> 02:54:43,180
Not right now

792
02:55:01,979 --> 02:55:05,000
Old cheese cold cheese cold cheese

793
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:12,000
Cold cheese, they probably heat it up. They probably I never had one. They discontinued that shit before I got to be

794
02:55:27,639 --> 02:55:34,180
All right, is this a hold on a second I can leave I

795
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:41,540
Can't you weren't kidding

796
02:55:46,120 --> 02:55:54,569
Yeah quickly

797
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:09,100
There's no frozen cheese on a mckee LP it was just perfect time to

798
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:19,120
Then

799
02:56:19,840 --> 02:56:40,170
These cars are still having people come out this fucking clown car scenario here

800
02:56:41,409 --> 02:56:44,530
I know this definitely a tube in the middle of this car

801
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:47,290
and it goes underground and this

802
02:56:47,889 --> 02:56:52,649
Like 500 people down on the ground, it's not all in this car

803
02:56:55,090 --> 02:57:04,040
Still going

804
02:57:17,870 --> 02:57:26,559
Change my weapon Wow, why I'm clearing

805
02:57:28,040 --> 02:57:47,090
Okay, how many more are there German don't reset the level

806
02:57:54,239 --> 02:57:57,180
Don't reset don't reset don't reset

807
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:09,420
Levels glitch don't stop don't listen to them

808
02:58:17,229 --> 02:58:24,809
But wait, I don't know what to believe don't listen

809
02:58:26,809 --> 02:58:30,010
It's not bug it really does take this long

810
02:58:31,010 --> 02:58:37,190
I'll try another I'm gonna go back to one of my other weapons. I know you

811
02:58:40,829 --> 02:58:44,750
What should I do I'm gonna give these I want to actually try the dual welding

812
02:58:55,670 --> 02:58:57,670
This does feel like it shouldn't be happening

813
02:59:05,190 --> 02:59:22,450
Reset start over it's common. Oh, no a mod said that this takes

814
02:59:33,399 --> 02:59:36,639
All right, so just get killed

815
02:59:46,639 --> 02:59:52,860
No, no, no, no, what do you mean? No, I gotta look this up

816
02:59:59,500 --> 03:00:25,239
Are you are you actually fucking with me I don't know

817
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:56,239
I need okay. There's like a thousand pizzas on the ground. I'm gonna have to go get some guys

818
03:00:59,600 --> 03:01:05,149
Restarts if I restart and it was a lie. I'm gonna be so sad

819
03:01:06,510 --> 03:01:14,520
The guy I'm gonna open up a guide

820
03:01:22,149 --> 03:01:24,149
Don't reset I like

821
03:01:24,590 --> 03:01:27,719
I

822
03:01:28,639 --> 03:01:36,639
Just got hit by the fucking car

823
03:01:41,739 --> 03:01:44,979
Okay, I think it's I think it's fucked up. I did now I think it is

824
03:01:45,780 --> 03:01:49,500
Now I know I I think it's messed up now. I think it's screwed up. I

825
03:01:56,540 --> 03:02:00,100
Think it's messed up. It's been too long. There's no way this would be this long

826
03:02:04,399 --> 03:02:06,399
I'm starting

827
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:25,000
You're gonna have to do this again

828
03:02:25,840 --> 03:02:28,399
No, it's no way

829
03:02:28,639 --> 03:02:32,079
This no ways. Yeah, I know I agree

830
03:02:37,049 --> 03:02:40,129
No, not yes way this no way is that

831
03:02:41,090 --> 03:02:43,090
This is not the way it's supposed to be

832
03:02:43,809 --> 03:02:45,950
It's bugged. I believe it now

833
03:02:46,770 --> 03:03:02,959
No, it's not this just got spawned over here. Oh

834
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:28,239
My god, I was gonna turn it off. I was gonna reset it. It's shocking to me that that's not

835
03:03:28,760 --> 03:03:30,920
That's shocking to me that this is real. I

836
03:03:31,719 --> 03:03:40,399
Was about to reset the game. I was gonna let him just beat the shit out of me and start it over and do it

837
03:03:40,399 --> 03:03:42,440
All over again you guys so many of you

838
03:03:43,079 --> 03:03:46,479
We're so corrected and so many of you. We're just

839
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:51,719
gas lighters, oh

840
03:03:52,360 --> 03:04:06,000
Can't believe it. I don't want to do that again. So I want to save it somewhere. Okay, I

841
03:04:06,399 --> 03:04:14,059
Have a question was this made to make you go. Hello. That was too long and

842
03:04:14,739 --> 03:04:17,420
What was that? Is that like supposed to be like that?

843
03:04:28,239 --> 03:04:33,780
Making fun of consumerism. Oh, yeah. No, that's what I thought too

844
03:04:34,639 --> 03:04:37,200
like the over consumption of

845
03:04:37,879 --> 03:04:42,340
Yes, I thought too. I

846
03:04:42,340 --> 03:04:43,899
Get it

847
03:04:43,899 --> 03:04:45,500
other people don't

848
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:51,319
We do

849
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:16,280
Reset it's not too late. It's still glitched my favorite comment. I think of the whole night. Oh

850
03:05:17,239 --> 03:05:24,579
Shit, dude, you're right. I should probably get out of it or it's too late. Oh

851
03:05:33,760 --> 03:06:00,260
The combos just keep going. Are we fighting a guy with a peony burn this song up? Okay

852
03:06:18,399 --> 03:06:22,309
There you go

853
03:06:33,030 --> 03:06:36,350
Be one with your force people happy

854
03:07:10,969 --> 03:07:15,579
Get through there

855
03:07:19,670 --> 03:07:21,670
You're bringing a left

856
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:35,559
Down

857
03:07:35,559 --> 03:07:37,899
That stays up

858
03:07:37,899 --> 03:07:42,829
Everybody just died there

859
03:07:42,829 --> 03:07:59,510
There's a treasure chest over here pain killer collection number seven

860
03:08:10,090 --> 03:08:24,670
Fred whoa

861
03:08:24,709 --> 03:08:26,709
That one cool

862
03:08:26,829 --> 03:08:30,180
It was like a real opening to narrow go

863
03:08:31,420 --> 03:08:34,639
This is what it sounds like

864
03:08:34,639 --> 03:08:43,579
Got the gun

865
03:08:43,860 --> 03:08:47,620
That's exactly exactly what I wanted. That's great

866
03:08:57,399 --> 03:08:59,719
I mean some tiger roar. There it is

867
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:04,040
One with your force

868
03:09:16,010 --> 03:09:22,729
The world like

869
03:09:27,250 --> 03:09:29,250
How is it

870
03:09:29,889 --> 03:09:31,889
Educatingly, what how is this hurry music?

871
03:09:32,729 --> 03:09:44,700
Going to hear theory

872
03:09:44,700 --> 03:09:46,139
one guy

873
03:09:46,139 --> 03:09:48,569
What's that one guy's theory?

874
03:10:03,260 --> 03:10:06,579
$50 5,000 bits from killer crock-mire. Thanks a lot

875
03:10:07,700 --> 03:10:11,409
5,000 bits

876
03:10:11,409 --> 03:10:13,409
Fuck

877
03:10:14,649 --> 03:10:16,649
Thank you people just give that to me

878
03:10:17,409 --> 03:10:20,069
Thank you regardless

879
03:10:20,069 --> 03:10:27,530
And they say we better see Travis strikes back on steam. Wait a minute. Isn't it Travis strikes again?

880
03:10:28,409 --> 03:10:34,520
It's the suit of love later game and it's the perfect master fun and weird that makes for a good screen game

881
03:10:34,520 --> 03:10:36,520
Also, get your god hands out Jack

882
03:10:37,200 --> 03:10:42,020
Yeah, I was like

883
03:10:42,020 --> 03:10:51,899
Landis play it when but hopefully soon. All right, we got we got the music that was cool

884
03:10:52,459 --> 03:11:09,559
Get this back to normal. You promised a new game today. I

885
03:11:10,399 --> 03:11:12,709
Don't know what stream you watched yesterday

886
03:11:19,450 --> 03:11:34,129
Wait, is this the TF2 thing again? I thought it was Cinco de Mayo. We're that way today is Cinco de Mayo for the pretend

887
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:38,120
Thing that people were making up

888
03:11:38,479 --> 03:11:44,979
Yeah, it wasn't Cinco de Mayo like the pretend look

889
03:11:45,020 --> 03:11:49,260
Let's make him let's let's make him think he's crazy enough where he said he was gonna do this on Cinco de Mayo

890
03:12:04,059 --> 03:12:09,120
All right, what is this boss who's ranked number four three or whatever the hell it is

891
03:12:13,959 --> 03:12:29,360
Um that moon's real close

892
03:12:30,239 --> 03:12:37,840
That's just gonna crash into the planet like an asteroid. Is that what it would look like?

893
03:12:38,399 --> 03:12:46,319
Holy shit imagine how terrifying that would be no I just looking up one day at night and the moon is that close

894
03:12:51,440 --> 03:13:02,719
It will be funny this will be funny. All right, it's a sniper

895
03:13:18,319 --> 03:13:36,590

There's a jump right there. You telling me I'm not supposed I can't do that

985
03:32:05,819 --> 03:32:13,360
That's sad

986
03:32:18,370 --> 03:32:20,860
That's how I got into the level yeah, but I

987
03:32:30,479 --> 03:32:31,920
That was bad

988
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:33,920
All right. Here we go

989
03:32:36,430 --> 03:32:44,350
On the other side dude, this is just like that battle toads level

990
03:32:50,899 --> 03:33:00,510
Whoa, that was big

991
03:33:00,510 --> 03:33:02,510
Dude, huge air

No, you can't do it. Don't even tell me I can I look you can't see it protects you

993
03:33:15,250 --> 03:33:31,149
It puts bumpers on my bowling alley game. I'm supposed to be doing that

994
03:33:43,459 --> 03:33:51,219
Uh pointless santa destroy is a magnet for the bizarre

995
03:33:52,180 --> 03:33:54,180
There are things I still don't understand

996
03:33:55,139 --> 03:33:57,139
It is a melting pot

997
03:33:57,540 --> 03:33:59,620
not only of cultures and people

998
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:02,659
But even space I even have that second

999
03:34:03,379 --> 03:34:09,229
You can't lose you can't die. Nothing happens. You just drive on your bike. You could have

1000
03:34:10,110 --> 03:34:12,110
Cut the scene to me for 10 seconds, man

03:34:12,350 --> 03:34:21,739
Hey, all right here. We uh, it's not oh

It ain't oh

1003
03:34:23,659 --> 03:34:25,840
I'm gonna say that was kind of strange

1004
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:42,959
I thought that was a big deer like a moose or an elk

1005
03:34:43,840 --> 03:34:48,260
You have to admit that was very elk-like

1006
03:34:48,579 --> 03:35:06,819
Oh, that was scripted. Okay

1007
03:35:07,620 --> 03:35:21,389
I jumped over and I still hit it. I thought that was the boss. I was like, oh this guy looks ridiculous

1008
03:35:22,430 --> 03:35:25,309
He's like a bubblegum guy with funny shoes on

1009
03:35:51,139 --> 03:35:53,139
Engage on his chest

1010
03:36:03,409 --> 03:36:11,139
He has like a big orbital beam what the hell I gotta fight a whole fucking space program now attack successful

1011
03:36:11,700 --> 03:36:15,059
Reacquire a target and eliminate enemy

1012
03:36:16,260 --> 03:36:18,350
All right

1013
03:36:18,350 --> 03:36:20,350
Right to the point on this one, huh?

1014
03:36:21,309 --> 03:36:25,090
I don't think I want this out. Let's try the dual welding

1015
03:36:34,110 --> 03:36:39,739
Summons rocks. You gotta go around them

1016
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:51,010
Oh

1017
03:36:53,649 --> 03:36:55,649
All right, so he's like loading

1018
03:37:05,940 --> 03:37:08,579
You know when the you know when like grass starts getting in the way

1019
03:37:10,819 --> 03:37:13,059
When the wheat on the ground starts getting in the way

I think i'm taking out the big guy

1024
03:37:54,959 --> 03:38:02,270
Yeah, i'm taking a big guy

1025
03:38:02,270 --> 03:38:04,270
More damage. Let's go

1026
03:38:04,270 --> 03:38:15,840
I think one good hit

1027
03:38:19,700 --> 03:38:26,190
Don't swing more than once twice unnecessary

1028
03:38:29,979 --> 03:38:52,579
Do wait, i'm not out of there, but I have that move now watch it. You are so annoying

03:40:18,979 --> 03:40:21,459
This is just like sad read receipts guy

1035
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:39,069
I was at a battery

03:40:40,350 --> 03:41:02,399
Almost there. I can let me get the super fast one. Hey, he predicted me so well right there

1037
03:41:04,110 --> 03:41:05,790
Not even fucking cool

03:41:05,790 --> 03:41:18,450
I think they're

1039
03:41:19,090 --> 03:41:30,840
I don't know what that is, but it looks like it hurts flying around

1040
03:41:35,020 --> 03:41:45,840

03:43:59,280 --> 03:44:19,059
Wrestling can I wrestle him? I don't think so. You're gonna catch me

Yes, you are. Oh

03:44:29,059 --> 03:44:32,959
Sorry, he's not paying attention. He got disconnected

1054
03:44:33,760 --> 03:45:00,770
Don't get hit by that

1055
03:45:00,850 --> 03:45:08,100
Oh fuck is this this do I run?

1056
03:45:09,059 --> 03:45:13,670
All right. Do you just run away from that big explosion? Do I have to like dodge through it or I don't just run out

1057
03:45:13,750 --> 03:45:29,489
Run away

1058
03:45:46,159 --> 03:45:48,159
Run run run run

1059
03:45:48,799 --> 03:45:52,000
Run the fuck away. How far do I have to run?

03:45:55,889 --> 03:46:04,049
That far he's doing it again

1061
03:46:22,159 --> 03:46:25,360
You have to do this at the absolute worst time every single time

1062
03:46:32,530 --> 03:46:36,159
Yes, stop

1063
03:46:36,159 --> 03:46:38,159
You're annoying me. You bother

03:47:07,750 --> 03:47:10,790
Oh shit

1066
03:47:10,790 --> 03:47:16,600
This is far enough away

1067
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:25,909
It is thinking I tried to kill him

1068
03:47:31,840 --> 03:47:40,870
Oh

1069
03:47:41,190 --> 03:47:45,090
All right, this is it

1070
03:47:45,649 --> 03:47:47,649
Goodbye, okay

1071
03:48:15,559 --> 03:48:17,559
It's over captain this

1072
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:20,520
This is earth

1073
03:48:20,680 --> 03:48:21,719
Yeah

1074
03:48:21,719 --> 03:48:28,659
Welcome. Holy shit. This dude is so wrinkled. It looks like a piece of wood. I'm finally back after all this time

1075
03:48:29,459 --> 03:48:31,760
fresh oxygen

1076
03:48:31,920 --> 03:48:33,920
Blue sky

1077
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:48,500
Build glory to the soviet union. He's just trying to get a signal the whole time

1078
03:48:50,309 --> 03:48:52,309
Why did what did I what did I do?

1079
03:48:59,750 --> 03:49:01,750
You are now ranked third

1080
03:49:05,909 --> 03:49:07,680
Just leave him alone

1081
03:49:07,680 --> 03:49:09,520
Let him rest in peace

1082
03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:15,600
We must dispose of the remains its policy screw your policy. He's back with the earth after who knows how long

1083
03:49:16,239 --> 03:49:18,639
You're not gonna suck him up with your damn vacuum

1084
03:49:20,389 --> 03:49:22,069
Please respond

1085
03:49:22,069 --> 03:49:24,229
Oh

1086
03:49:24,229 --> 03:49:26,229
Guess what a response

1087
03:49:26,229 --> 03:50:02,629
Well, that was sad. We're coming down to the end of the road here two more battles

1088
03:50:03,670 --> 03:50:19,829
And I win

1089
03:50:19,829 --> 03:50:25,329
bat jr

1090
03:50:25,329 --> 03:50:27,489
I don't have time for guessing games

1091
03:50:34,579 --> 03:50:36,579
All the information I have

1092
03:50:41,809 --> 03:50:43,809
Damn you

1093
03:50:44,610 --> 03:50:48,819
I like the national anthem of santa distroy

1094
03:50:49,780 --> 03:50:56,180
It's everywhere. It's on tv. It's on the radio. It's on phone calls and shit. It's everywhere

1095
03:50:58,049 --> 03:51:01,780
Oh cat's done

1096
03:51:01,780 --> 03:51:03,620
Did everything I can do with cat

1097
03:51:03,620 --> 03:51:08,870
All I can see now is I can see there's any more weapons

1098
03:51:16,280 --> 03:51:20,120
You've heard about two of the supernatural gateways in santa destroy

1099
03:51:21,489 --> 03:51:26,600
The third most fitting mystery of all for a city fixated on the ranks

1100
03:51:27,239 --> 03:51:30,129
Sealed from the cacophony of modern life

1101
03:51:30,770 --> 03:51:36,979
There lived the last abstaining from all worldly indulgences

1102
03:51:37,440 --> 03:51:43,989
The ascetics spent every waking hour in training had become an obsession for this warrior

1103
03:51:44,709 --> 03:51:45,989
the end all

1104
03:51:45,989 --> 03:51:48,770
the raison d'etre

1105
03:51:48,770 --> 03:51:53,969
You know, i've never abstained from anything or in the stream. I can relate

1106
03:51:55,010 --> 03:52:01,139
When you're so focused on any goal it can make you do what you truly desire

1107
03:52:01,940 --> 03:52:16,440
Everybody said chat is cringe and then somebody said the game is cringe

1108
03:52:18,120 --> 03:52:21,829
All right, anything else I can do

1109
03:52:21,909 --> 03:52:35,850
All we need is somebody saying that i'm cringe in the middle of that and you've got the perfect

1110
03:52:36,569 --> 03:52:38,809
Total spectrum of what people think of the stream

1111
03:52:41,559 --> 03:52:43,559
No more moves, okay, that's it

1112
03:52:57,370 --> 03:52:59,370
So what's the point of having money now?

1113
03:52:59,690 --> 03:53:03,940
There's no weapons. There's no buy clothes

1114
03:53:04,579 --> 03:53:06,659
To all of these interesting side jobs, I guess

1115
03:53:07,540 --> 03:53:11,049
What's the point of doing them?

1116
03:53:11,049 --> 03:53:14,250
Close and Naomi Naomi hasn't had anything new

1117
03:53:15,209 --> 03:53:16,569
for like

1118
03:53:16,569 --> 03:53:18,569
Seven or six or seven in-game hours

1119
03:53:27,000 --> 03:53:40,520
Nothing here

1120
03:53:40,520 --> 03:53:44,360
I kind of miss being able to come back and buy upgrades for and new stuff

1121
03:53:47,700 --> 03:53:49,860
I have a store if there's going to be two items to buy

1122
03:53:50,579 --> 03:54:04,840
Do a revenge mission

1123
03:54:15,219 --> 03:54:19,219
Revenge kill the target within the time limit. I think I can maybe handle it

1124
03:54:19,620 --> 03:54:20,899
find out

1125
03:54:20,899 --> 03:54:27,829
Go get the guy with the gun

1126
03:54:27,829 --> 03:54:29,829

1131
03:55:31,379 --> 03:55:42,520
Jesus touch over the guy's blade. How would you even have done that?

1132
03:55:51,500 --> 03:55:58,090
Get over here

1133
03:55:58,090 --> 03:56:11,190
And it's over this shouldn't complete. Hey, we had fifty dollars five thousand bits

1134
03:56:11,750 --> 03:56:18,170
Fifty from goiki and goiki says chat is cringe game is cringe streamers cringe. I'm cringe

1135
03:56:18,569 --> 03:56:20,569
Is there any other cringe I should know about?

1136
03:56:22,809 --> 03:56:23,610

1137
03:56:23,610 --> 03:56:33,829

1143
03:57:49,209 --> 03:57:50,170

1149
03:59:17,739 --> 03:59:28,299

1150
03:59:40,579 --> 03:59:47,860
I missed a chest. I got one right here. Don't worry

1151
03:59:50,649 --> 03:59:57,620
Look at this

1152
03:59:58,950 --> 04:00:02,010
All right, I don't know why I thought you were saying

Get some money finally, why is he so sad?

1156
04:00:35,049 --> 04:00:37,049
All right, let's see

1157

04:01:06,649 --> 04:01:11,059
I don't even want to know what that that I don't even know what that is

1161
04:01:11,940 --> 04:01:14,899
That's one of those things that you don't even want to hear those words

1162
04:01:15,459 --> 04:01:20,020
Because then your brain goes what wait, hold on what I guess I could no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1163
04:01:20,020 --> 04:01:22,020

Why all four of you sitting in dark cars, it's kind of odd right

04:04:25,239 --> 04:04:32,540
Do a hot box in the car

1177
04:04:42,739 --> 04:04:46,969
All of them

04:04:47,370 --> 04:04:53,579

That's not something I don't want to do ever for any reason

1188
04:05:52,100 --> 04:05:58,379
I heard people

1189
04:06:10,629 --> 04:06:12,790
I'm sad. I killed this guy. He had a different voice line

1190
04:06:25,450 --> 04:06:31,850
Well, how do you smoke then, um don't have to be sitting in a parked car

1191

To smoke or ingest what do you talk? Why do you have to be in a why do you be sitting in a car?

1192
04:06:39,770 --> 04:06:57,639

04:07:06,780 --> 04:07:08,780
wrestling

1194
04:07:11,100 --> 04:07:13,180
The hot boxes with his farts

You're disgusting. In fact, in fact, you know what like you got you got to get timed out for like

1206
04:09:59,190 --> 04:10:01,620
How do you do it?

1207
04:10:02,629 --> 04:10:06,389
Oh, whoa, I guess these guys were hot boxing their apartments

1208
04:10:19,290 --> 04:10:21,290

04:10:21,290 --> 04:10:44,270
Dude, okay, this is gonna be disgusting

1210
04:10:47,739 --> 04:10:53,459
But do you guys remember it was uh, there was this movie that was

Like he was like a two-year-old or something and like whatever it was

1214
04:11:09,479 --> 04:11:15,430
No, not bison's anymore

1215
04:11:15,590 --> 04:11:17,590
It was like he was reversed aging

1216
04:11:17,590 --> 04:11:22,790
He was like reversed aging like when he was like 30. He was like one year old or something, right?

1217
04:11:26,059 --> 04:11:33,350
It was accelerated egg. No, that's the curse. That's the that's the curse of benjamin button

1218
04:11:34,389 --> 04:11:36,389
But the same fucking movie anyways

1219
04:11:37,540 --> 04:11:39,620
so

1220
04:11:39,620 --> 04:11:43,700
So in this movie he farts into like a coffee can and like closes the lid

1221
04:11:46,840 --> 04:11:51,959
And it's just disgusting and then I got it like a week later somebody opens it and like it smells

1222
04:11:53,639 --> 04:11:55,639
Something's happened to the movie

1223
04:11:55,639 --> 04:12:00,180

You do realize that if I was lying what a dumb thing to lie about you could figure this out in 10 minutes

1230
04:13:14,520 --> 04:13:20,649
Hey guys, so I saw this movie jack with robin williams and he farts into a can and then somebody spells it

1231
04:13:20,649 --> 04:13:25,610
Oh, it's so funny. I what you all takes is you five seconds to figure out i'm a liar

1232
04:13:26,729 --> 04:13:28,729
Like that doesn't happen in the movie

1233
04:13:36,440 --> 04:13:40,090

What's the actual last good sonic game? No messing around

1272
04:20:27,899 --> 04:20:34,700
No comedy like we're gonna we're gonna step back, you know, no more like just messing around what's actually the last good sonic game

1273
04:20:43,350 --> 04:20:54,750

04:21:33,379 --> 04:21:39,290
Where where where where where

04:21:44,309 --> 04:21:47,190
Should we face this great does it clean your teeth

1279
04:21:49,270 --> 04:21:51,290
often

1280
04:21:51,290 --> 04:21:53,850
I would say once or twice at least once or twice a day

1281
04:22:02,100 --> 04:22:04,860
Long, huh

1282
04:22:16,459 --> 04:22:18,459
Yeah, resident sleeper

1283
04:22:26,360 --> 04:22:28,520
How do you clean your teeth what do you guys use

1284
04:22:45,059 --> 04:22:48,500
Say that would probably be a very very bad idea if it were me I wouldn't do that

1285
04:22:55,879 --> 04:22:57,159
anybody else

1286
04:22:57,159 --> 04:23:00,969
Yeah

1287
04:23:09,030 --> 04:23:16,469
I use water toothpaste makes my stomach hurt. I use water toothpaste like water-based toothpaste or you use water

1288
04:23:20,340 --> 04:23:22,340
All toothpaste water-based toothpaste

1289
04:23:49,770 --> 04:23:51,770
Every time I see the word based based based on what

1290
04:23:52,489 --> 04:24:03,930
Why do you guys do that?

1291
04:24:04,920 --> 04:24:10,149
Do you swallow too much toothpaste? Well, the goal is not to swallow any toothpaste

1292
04:24:13,959 --> 04:24:15,959
How much toothpaste are you using

1293
04:24:17,290 --> 04:24:20,729
Imagine using half a tube of toothpaste every time you brush your teeth

1294
04:24:22,889 --> 04:24:37,450
How much toothpaste is in what is one serving?

1295
04:24:38,409 --> 04:24:40,569
Uh, it's a one pea-sized amount, right?

1296
04:24:41,899 --> 04:24:43,899
Do like a little a little dollop

1297
04:24:47,500 --> 04:24:50,639
That's not me trying to be funny that's actually supposed to use pea-sized

1298
04:24:58,420 --> 04:25:27,770
We're ready for the second rank battle now, this was a long one you're thinking of thermal paste

1299
04:25:29,129 --> 04:25:32,649
Do you chase your toothpaste?

1300
04:25:34,579 --> 04:25:36,659
um

1301
04:25:36,659 --> 04:25:39,430
I don't I spit it out

1302
04:25:39,430 --> 04:25:44,090
I hate using mouthwash. I really do

1303
04:25:45,219 --> 04:25:49,739
It sucks you put it in there and then you just want to get it out as soon as possible

1304
04:25:52,569 --> 04:25:55,690
Swish it around you're like I can take this it's not bad. It's been 10 seconds

1305
04:25:55,690 --> 04:25:56,409
I'm good

1306
04:25:56,409 --> 04:26:00,170
And then and then that's when it starts to really like your brain just starts to scream at you that it hurts

1307
04:26:02,920 --> 04:26:17,940
And then you just go now. I don't care spit it up. It hurts a good. It's not a good hurt

1308
04:26:19,219 --> 04:26:20,340
it's a

1309
04:26:20,340 --> 04:26:23,860
It's like I ate too many sour candies hurt like

1310
04:26:24,979 --> 04:26:30,139
I hate it. I hate that feeling travis touchdown, correct?

1311
04:26:31,020 --> 04:26:33,819
Yeah, that's me the no more hero

1312
04:26:34,700 --> 04:26:36,700
how unfortunate

1313
04:26:36,700 --> 04:26:39,979
Right when I am about to reach the top you have to find me

1314
04:26:40,940 --> 04:26:43,659
I was hoping we'd fight after I became number one

1315
04:26:45,139 --> 04:26:47,139
Sorry to crush your dreams

1316
04:26:47,379 --> 04:26:51,219
I hate to do it, but i've got business with that son of a bitch

1317
04:26:51,860 --> 04:26:53,860
And I can't let you get to him first

1318
04:26:55,219 --> 04:26:58,100
Please don't think of me as a nuisance

1319
04:26:58,899 --> 04:27:04,260
But I will make sure your victory isn't easy. It's me the no more heroes to desperate struggle

1320
04:27:09,899 --> 04:27:16,059
I've seen a lot in my journey up the ranks an endless cycle of violence now broadcast as a spectator

1321
04:27:16,299 --> 04:27:19,920
Everybody else get a shitload of anxiety when popcorn pops like this in the microwave

1322
04:27:20,639 --> 04:27:25,520
If we are all going to end up I feel like it's gonna explode every time does it really matter why

1323
04:27:26,399 --> 04:27:28,239
To me it does

1324
04:27:28,239 --> 04:27:30,239
It matters more than anything

1325
04:27:30,940 --> 04:27:32,940
We've all become trapped. Don't you see?

1326
04:27:33,479 --> 04:27:35,819
Addicted to the violence to a life in the shadows

1327
04:27:36,620 --> 04:27:38,940
Once we join the ranks we can never get out

1328
04:27:39,739 --> 04:27:43,260
Don't be stupid if you get tired of the battles just fucking quit

1329
04:27:44,139 --> 04:27:48,940
But that's why we all want to fight you to learn your secret. Don't you get it?

1330
04:27:49,940 --> 04:27:56,079
Three hundred thousand dollars at naomi. You are the crownless king. They only sell one product

1331
04:27:56,559 --> 04:28:01,819
You reach the top can't miss it walked away. Well, i'm back now aren't I?

1332
04:28:05,399 --> 04:28:12,600
You are no more heroes show me your passion release me from this cycle free us all in a crimson sea

1333
04:28:16,319 --> 04:28:18,319
You asked for it bring it on

1334
04:28:25,680 --> 04:28:50,579
And negotiate don't move shit he said the fucking thing

1335
04:28:56,799 --> 04:29:00,559
All right, the guy floating around his face was a little a guy floating around his face

1336
04:29:00,639 --> 04:29:02,959
It's gonna be better than a fighter lady

1337
04:29:20,090 --> 04:29:22,090
For you too

1338
04:29:22,969 --> 04:29:26,639
Wouldn't even be at a couple zeros

1339
04:29:26,639 --> 04:29:31,739
Those

1340
04:29:32,059 --> 04:29:38,059
Yeah, the guy's just looking to fucking get out of read receipts and one of the good cell phone signal is better than you

1341
04:29:38,459 --> 04:29:40,459
at full power

1342
04:29:41,979 --> 04:29:43,979
Ah shit shouldn't talk shit

1343
04:30:04,959 --> 04:30:06,959
Good parry here

1344
04:30:07,600 --> 04:30:22,620
I don't know. I think she's fell

1345
04:30:24,540 --> 04:30:34,059
All right, I need to charge

1346
04:30:34,059 --> 04:30:37,459
Oh

1347
04:30:43,659 --> 04:30:45,180
Get down from there

1348
04:30:45,180 --> 04:30:48,479
All right. Now she's just corner camping. She's just camping in the corner

1349
04:30:49,200 --> 04:30:52,159
She's got like a good item and she's just sitting there. Oh, I can't move

1350
04:30:52,879 --> 04:31:26,059
What are you doing stuck in the same move?

1351
04:31:26,780 --> 04:31:48,079
Holy shit lady

1352
04:31:53,379 --> 04:32:03,190
Your level was really long and this boss fight is just over

1353
04:32:15,739 --> 04:32:17,739
Oh, it's just going through the wall

1354
04:32:18,540 --> 04:32:21,020
Just going through the wall shit's going through the fuck

1355
04:32:22,379 --> 04:32:24,940
Okay, get the hell out of here frank too, by the way

1356
04:32:28,639 --> 04:32:31,040
You know nothing happened. We were in the middle of a big fight

1357
04:32:31,760 --> 04:32:33,840
And I she got hit in the head way too hard

1358
04:32:34,879 --> 04:32:38,959
Right off the bat and it was just slowing her down. It was just over if she couldn't she was all fucked up

1359
04:32:40,559 --> 04:32:43,309
Everything I hoped for

1360
04:32:44,639 --> 04:32:54,610
Don't matter how good you are you get like big fucking knock on the noggin was an assassin named alice. I won't forget

1361
04:33:00,399 --> 04:33:13,099
Number two boy number one

1362
04:33:26,590 --> 04:33:29,389
You are now officially ranked second

1363
04:33:38,770 --> 04:33:40,049
See that

1364
04:33:40,049 --> 04:33:42,049
Now that was a battle

1365
04:33:42,130 --> 04:33:47,090
Look at this blood. We humans are alive even if we are assassins

1366
04:33:47,490 --> 04:33:52,930
Doesn't matter if it's a video game movie drama anime manga. We're alive

1367
04:33:53,650 --> 04:33:55,650
People shed blood and die

1368
04:33:56,130 --> 04:33:57,729
This isn't a game

1369
04:33:57,729 --> 04:34:04,209
You can't just selfishly use death as your tool. Oh my god. Relax. Okay, you can have a han solo figurine

1370
04:34:05,409 --> 04:34:07,409
Sorry, I brought it up

1371
04:34:15,099 --> 04:34:19,520
Are you done bitching you could never shut down the association

1372
04:34:20,479 --> 04:34:24,400
Fighting to be the best is human nature. It's evolution

1373
04:34:25,279 --> 04:34:29,040
Who are we to try and stand in its way? Fuck that

1374
04:34:29,599 --> 04:34:36,319
I want to be a hero by my own standards. You need to wake up travis. Take your own goddamn advice

1375
04:34:37,840 --> 04:34:43,349
Alice moonlight

1376
04:34:43,990 --> 04:34:50,130
Who's number one?

1377
04:34:50,130 --> 04:35:13,159
10 hours and 20 minutes

1378
04:35:13,159 --> 04:35:15,159
Shave off about 25 of that though

1379
04:35:15,400 --> 04:35:17,009
That was spent

1380
04:35:17,009 --> 04:35:21,009
Um, that was spent doing the cvd tile game. It's me

1381
04:35:21,729 --> 04:35:25,240
Are you ready for your last battle to the death? Yeah

1382
04:35:26,439 --> 04:35:28,439
You know where to go

1383
04:35:29,000 --> 04:35:31,000
It's close by

1384
04:35:33,650 --> 04:35:34,770
Hold on

1385
04:35:34,770 --> 04:35:36,770
Someone's at the door

1386
04:35:37,009 --> 04:35:39,490
It's my first time here, isn't it?

1387
04:35:40,450 --> 04:35:46,130
We fight her a vip just showed up talk to you soon

1388
04:35:47,409 --> 04:35:55,479
Sure

1389
04:35:55,479 --> 04:35:57,479
Sylvia, I can't figure you out

1390
04:35:58,279 --> 04:36:01,159
You don't like me. I didn't say that

1391
04:36:01,720 --> 04:36:03,959
But there's a lot of things about you. I don't get

1392
04:36:04,759 --> 04:36:05,880
You lie

1393
04:36:05,880 --> 04:36:07,560
You're greedy

1394
04:36:07,560 --> 04:36:11,639
You're a fucking contradiction in heels. This always freaks me out. You hate me

1395
04:36:12,279 --> 04:36:17,000
Well, your personality kind of sucks like this is extra radiation. So you do hate me

1396
04:36:18,639 --> 04:36:20,639
I'm crazy about you

1397
04:36:21,490 --> 04:36:23,090
What do you mean?

1398
04:36:23,090 --> 04:36:33,189
Fuck if I know

1399
04:36:33,189 --> 04:36:49,299
You

1400
04:36:49,299 --> 04:36:55,750
Earthquake hang on to something

1401
04:37:08,389 --> 04:37:30,930
Okay

1402
04:37:30,930 --> 04:37:46,389
Play I can't play with the cat anymore. I've exceeded all cat stuff. I want to say I perhaps laughed

1403
04:37:47,029 --> 04:38:14,599
Do it anyways, you want to pretend to play with the cat anybody else feel like these these clothes smell like an attic?

1404
04:38:15,889 --> 04:38:17,889
That's a shirt you get out of the attic

1405
04:38:18,470 --> 04:38:30,340
And it stinks like mothballs and mildew and shit. It's very clearly an attic shirt

1406
04:38:31,299 --> 04:38:45,279
All right ranking battle number one, what about Naomi's lab are you gonna give me anything else to buy before the game ends?

04:38:58,119 --> 04:39:17,909

1424
04:41:36,720 --> 04:41:47,090

I'm probably making a lot of money

1487
04:53:50,779 --> 04:53:53,270
That means I can buy a bunch of clothes

1488
04:53:53,270 --> 04:54:05,619

Don't even fight anybody else that's got to be worth a lot of money, right?

1492
04:54:44,979 --> 04:54:50,680
How much money do I even have I haven't even looked

1493
04:54:59,139 --> 04:55:03,529
Uh, what was that obtained? No jacket

1494
04:55:05,209 --> 04:55:07,209
There you go

1495
04:55:07,209 --> 04:55:08,330
I did it

1496
04:55:08,330 --> 04:55:14,020
Now we need our final part of the game

1497
04:55:14,419 --> 04:55:23,259
outfit

1498
04:55:25,740 --> 04:55:41,099
Is it no pants too

1499
04:55:41,419 --> 04:55:49,450
Have to do it at the hotel

1500
04:55:49,450 --> 04:55:54,349
All right. How about like bell box? I don't um, where's my money 5,800

1501
04:55:55,500 --> 04:55:57,500
I just did like a bunch of revenge missions

1502
04:55:58,599 --> 04:55:59,560
What?

1503
04:55:59,560 --> 04:56:05,380
I gotta make a little bit money

1504
04:56:05,380 --> 04:56:08,330
All right. Let me make let me make some money real quick

1505
04:56:31,669 --> 04:56:33,669
No, i'm gonna do the meat one

1506
04:56:33,990 --> 04:56:40,310
This one's the easiest one to understand

1507
04:56:40,709 --> 04:56:43,529
Because I like this song the best

1508
04:57:05,750 --> 04:57:08,439
Just listen to it

1509
04:57:11,930 --> 04:57:23,040
Well, it takes forever

1510
04:57:28,919 --> 04:57:30,919
Medium yeah, here you go. Don't puke

1511
04:57:53,689 --> 04:57:57,720
Here's a game called, uh river city ransom

1512
04:57:59,669 --> 04:58:04,709
This just reminds me of river city ransom. You would go to this shop. There'd be like a bakery or like a coffee shop

1513
04:58:05,189 --> 04:58:07,189
And you'd sit down

1514
04:58:07,270 --> 04:58:09,669
And eat food for health and bonuses

1515
04:58:10,229 --> 04:58:14,549
You pick up the whole plate and eat the whole plate or you'd eat the cup too if you were buying a cup of tea

1516
04:58:15,270 --> 04:58:18,150
They would put the cup of tea in their mouth and crunch it down and eat it

1517
04:58:25,860 --> 04:58:27,860
I wonder if that game still holds up

1518
04:58:27,860 --> 04:58:29,860
Does that game hold up anybody? No

1519
04:58:43,450 --> 04:58:50,900
Jeremy you got good at the steak minigame, uh just to match the picture played on switch

1520
04:59:03,270 --> 04:59:05,270
Perfect

1521
04:59:10,979 --> 04:59:12,979

Perfect give me the easy ones. Thanks a lot

04:59:33,430 --> 04:59:45,540
This is all for the final outfit. We have to make sure we get it correct 24 000. All right, this is it

1525
04:59:54,459 --> 04:59:56,459
Perfect

1526
05:00:03,159 --> 05:00:05,400
Yeah, you lay the pipe I don't need to

1527
05:00:05,400 --> 05:00:12,360
Well, this would be enough money this would be more than enough money

1528
05:00:25,000 --> 05:00:27,500
It's very delicious is in a row

1529
05:00:42,139 --> 05:01:00,970
Perfect enjoy it. That was a little under all right

1530
05:01:04,650 --> 05:01:08,619
It's a little over

1531
05:01:09,020 --> 05:01:19,180
Well, not

1532
05:01:22,439 --> 05:01:24,439
It's gonna be a lot of money

1533
05:01:33,939 --> 05:01:48,409
Okay, now we can go get our clothes succeeded in making about 70 or 80 thousand dollars it's a big payday

1534
05:01:50,009 --> 05:01:52,009
54 000 bucks

1535
05:01:57,880 --> 05:02:19,419
All right, let's go get the hotel say goodbye to the cat take the jacket off

1536
05:02:21,259 --> 05:02:26,630
And then take off the shirt too. Wait, I can just be the graphic tea guy that I wanted to be right?

1537
05:02:45,430 --> 05:02:58,419
Perfect take the pants off. Yeah

1538
05:03:00,360 --> 05:03:18,060
You can't

1539
05:03:18,060 --> 05:03:20,459
Like when you're at the convention and you have a big costume

1540
05:03:21,479 --> 05:03:25,799
And after two or three hours of walking around in the big top part that has a bunch of foam and shit

1541
05:03:25,799 --> 05:03:31,430
You probably get so this is like i'll walk around in the bottom half. That's fine in my t-shirt

1542
05:03:37,580 --> 05:03:39,580
I don't need anything spectacular up here

1543
05:03:42,169 --> 05:03:43,689
pursuit

1544
05:03:43,770 --> 05:03:45,849
Any suit I anything any

1545
05:03:46,729 --> 05:03:48,729
Like it could be a mascot

1546
05:03:48,729 --> 05:03:51,540
It should be a guy at disneyworld for all that fucking matters

1547
05:03:53,770 --> 05:03:55,659
Cat you idiot

1548
05:03:55,659 --> 05:03:59,180
Okay, bye cat. Good. You saw the extent of what I could play with the cat fine

05:13:22,200 --> 05:13:25,479
Why do you listen?

1601
05:13:25,479 --> 05:13:33,080
Well, it doesn't matter really expected to know anybody even on that phone you came here almost every day

1602
05:13:34,279 --> 05:13:39,740
Paid to hear me ramble that gave me as much happiness as I can hope for

1603
05:13:40,380 --> 05:13:46,009
There's nothing left to lose

1604
05:13:46,709 --> 05:13:49,750
Every day as joyless as the one before it

1605
05:13:51,110 --> 05:13:58,069
Eyes closed continue to endure. Why does the stream have the exact same camera angles when I come back?

1606
05:13:58,869 --> 05:14:00,869
after a while of not watching

1607
05:14:01,930 --> 05:14:05,689
Uh, because it's like a 20 chance. There's gonna be a close-up

1608
05:14:06,889 --> 05:14:30,099
Of a girl's chest on this game. Let me hear what you sound like as your dress

05:15:01,459 --> 05:15:17,959
Keep going more spawns

05:15:18,119 --> 05:15:20,119
I want to make this happen

1615
05:15:25,049 --> 05:15:42,439
Fast dead rising. It's gonna look like dead rising. You're right

1616
05:15:44,439 --> 05:15:56,979

When I could show you guys my secret steak of trust, but I don't know if anybody wants to see that

1622
05:16:43,479 --> 05:16:59,270
I need to do a steak of live stream. Maybe I will

1623
05:17:01,369 --> 05:17:11,610
Maybe I will maybe i'll do maybe i'll make some my world famous fucking steak and sandwiches

1624
05:17:12,490 --> 05:17:25,479
Did you do this what are you gonna do on july 30th?

1625
05:17:26,360 --> 05:17:30,220
Oh, I don't know what july 30th maybe

1626
05:17:31,180 --> 05:17:34,139
Let's see if we got anything else going on. Yeah planned for like somewhere in late july

1627
05:17:35,099 --> 05:17:39,580
I'm, not sure if there's anything else going on that day, but i'll um

1628
05:17:40,459 --> 05:17:42,459
I feel like late july like july 29 30th

1629
05:17:43,500 --> 05:17:48,900
There's stuff going on, you know, like a new game might come out of it

1630
05:18:02,220 --> 05:18:07,500
Stake them with the easy bake up, uh, that will probably break and I don't want to break it

1631
05:18:10,020 --> 05:18:12,180
Cricket to the chainsaw guys before it runs up

1632
05:18:28,360 --> 05:18:31,740
This is very very painful

1633
05:18:41,220 --> 05:18:57,209
Wrestling I really hope the easy bake up and turns on

1634
05:18:58,169 --> 05:19:00,169
I really need to make sure the thing actually works

1635
05:19:00,810 --> 05:19:04,459
I gotta do a trial run to like heat it up a little bit before I even

1636
05:19:05,099 --> 05:19:07,720
Be bad

1637
05:19:32,900 --> 05:19:35,380
Why do I know exactly what you mean by toontown villains

1638
05:19:54,950 --> 05:19:56,790
Guys from the commercial

1639
05:19:56,790 --> 05:20:05,049
but these guys that uh

1640
05:20:05,049 --> 05:20:07,799
you guys have to have the um

1641
05:20:09,610 --> 05:20:12,299
You know, I'll just do the impression

1642
05:20:12,299 --> 05:20:15,259
And the goons are gonna take over toontown. They talk like that, right?

1643
05:20:15,900 --> 05:20:26,900
Something like that

1644
05:20:26,900 --> 05:20:32,790
Is it just one person back here?

1645
05:20:33,110 --> 05:20:38,020
There's no voice acting in toontown. I remember the commercial though. It was like a guy looked like goofy

1646
05:20:38,500 --> 05:20:41,700
And a pie was gone and he would like shoot pies at people's faces

1647
05:20:43,380 --> 05:20:47,220
The voiceover in the background talked like that. It was just like are we gonna save the toons?

1648
05:20:47,779 --> 05:20:50,439
You gotta get out there and make an account at toontown.org

1649
05:20:51,619 --> 05:20:53,619
Ask your parents permission first

1650
05:20:54,409 --> 05:20:56,009
I remember watching it

1651
05:20:56,009 --> 05:21:02,069
My mother didn't let me play it

1652
05:21:02,069 --> 05:21:09,750
I forgot to see what you guys were talking about. I didn't like how much how violent it was

1653
05:21:23,450 --> 05:21:25,450
Where's the last person?

1654
05:21:34,680 --> 05:21:36,680
old person

1655
05:21:39,189 --> 05:21:41,349
Stick to stick stick to sticks

1656
05:21:42,150 --> 05:21:46,229
What is that? What's that coming from?

1657
05:21:53,110 --> 05:21:59,369
What is that?

1658
05:21:59,369 --> 05:22:03,770
Game breaking bug delete the stream. No, it's just this one person hiding behind a wall

1659
05:22:28,700 --> 05:22:30,299
save the toons

1660
05:22:30,299 --> 05:22:36,090
Were there any disney characters in that game?

1661
05:22:36,729 --> 05:22:46,310
It was it was like goofy and donald duck and mickey and stuff

1662
05:22:47,750 --> 05:23:00,349
Okay, this is where we switch switch to your guy's favorite weapon

1663
05:23:34,549 --> 05:23:37,750
Go welding would be so bad

1664
05:23:38,389 --> 05:23:44,490
I feel like it would be a pain in the ass. You'd accidentally hit yourself and shit. It would be hard to

1665
05:23:44,889 --> 05:23:48,409
Oh, just give me a big heavy shield as in a small knife

1666
05:23:50,869 --> 05:23:53,110
I just want a huge steel shield that

1667
05:23:53,990 --> 05:23:55,270
blocks everything

1668
05:23:55,270 --> 05:23:57,509
and then like a paring knife like a cheese knife

1669
05:23:58,389 --> 05:24:00,700
and I get in close and just like

1670
05:24:04,340 --> 05:24:11,639
Step that step that step in the neck. I'm talking like small like a dagger little one

1671
05:24:12,360 --> 05:24:15,500
You mean a shield? That's what i'm saying. I just said shield

1672
05:24:17,419 --> 05:24:19,419
Shield with a small paring knife

1673
05:24:20,220 --> 05:24:28,680
You weren't always like I would do a two-handed broadsword. No, you wouldn't those things are like fucking 700 pounds. No, you wouldn't

1674
05:24:29,479 --> 05:24:34,790
I'd use a a double-sided katana. No, you wouldn't you'd cut your hole. You cut your legs off

1675
05:24:35,909 --> 05:24:39,110
No, you'd use a cheese knife with a big shield like the rest of them

1676
05:24:39,909 --> 05:24:46,810
You guys don't know it took it took four people to lift up a broadsword

1677
05:24:50,549 --> 05:24:52,549
one person to hold the the

1678
05:24:52,630 --> 05:24:54,439
shaft

1679
05:24:54,439 --> 05:24:57,799
Two people to hold that guy up by the shoulders and then a guy

1680
05:24:58,360 --> 05:25:00,840
And I kind of sit on in case you fall down

1681
05:25:13,990 --> 05:25:16,279
come here

1682
05:25:16,279 --> 05:25:19,029
spawn already

1683
05:25:27,509 --> 05:25:29,509
He's not spawned in come on

1684
05:25:36,759 --> 05:25:40,119
Yeah, but for most of us that are like man, I would love him. Uh, just like

1685
05:25:40,680 --> 05:25:44,840
It's like an old knight like king arthur. I would want a big sword like king arthur

1686
05:25:45,720 --> 05:25:50,439
You would pick that thing up do a huge swing with it and throw your back out and put it down and be like

1687
05:25:50,520 --> 05:25:52,520
Ah, never mind

1688
05:25:53,479 --> 05:26:00,970
You get like a muscle spasm on trying to hold it straight in the air

1689
05:26:07,479 --> 05:26:15,799
And then we get started on using a whip

1690
05:26:16,040 --> 05:26:24,380
You will swing that whip around and try to get practice it and that thing will come back and crack you in the face

1691
05:26:25,580 --> 05:26:28,139
And you're gonna lose the top half of your lip

1692
05:26:41,349 --> 05:26:46,069
What's the best weapon, uh, it's very easy take a small cheese knife

1693
05:26:47,750 --> 05:26:54,630
Or a spear just a long ass spear with a big pointy really light big pointy thing of the enemy

1694
05:26:56,009 --> 05:26:58,090
Walk and stick it for it

1695
05:26:58,090 --> 05:27:08,389
spear

1696
05:27:08,389 --> 05:27:10,389
big spear with a shield

1697
05:27:10,470 --> 05:27:20,409
or a big rock

1698
05:27:20,409 --> 05:27:25,369
No, I yeah, I know i could see that like a big stone like a big a big rock to throw at people

1699
05:27:25,369 --> 05:27:27,369
We'll like hit him with a headwind

1700
05:27:29,669 --> 05:27:32,680
Fear and shield. Yeah

1701
05:27:32,680 --> 05:27:35,400
That means people can't come near you and if they do they're gonna hit the shield

1702
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:42,040
And this open the door, oh I have to open it

1703
05:28:03,080 --> 05:28:07,560
Yeah, and somebody's got it you do the thing where you you all have a shield and a spear

1704
05:28:10,150 --> 05:28:13,990
You stand back to back to back to back to back and you walk like a crab

1705
05:28:15,610 --> 05:28:17,610
Just no one will ever touch you

1706
05:28:23,779 --> 05:28:42,630
Phalanx phalanx formation. Yeah shit works. It was weak to fire bombs

1707
05:28:45,240 --> 05:28:46,119
um

1708
05:28:46,119 --> 05:28:48,279
We'll just update it and have like a powder guy

1709
05:28:48,840 --> 05:28:52,200
That has like a bunch of water and like powder and shit like jump on if there's a fire

1710
05:28:53,880 --> 05:28:59,509
You gotta have a weapon

1711
05:29:03,799 --> 05:29:05,560
Or just make a big umbrella

1712
05:29:05,560 --> 05:29:07,560
No, okay. Let me improve the balance

1713
05:29:07,720 --> 05:29:12,119
Just have a big umbrella made out of shield material that a guy in the middle holds up

1714
05:29:12,360 --> 05:29:15,880
So you got five you get six phalanxes that if they're out pacing out with their spears

1715
05:29:16,599 --> 05:29:22,299
And you've got a guy with an umbrella in the middle who walks with him who covers everybody with the steel shield umbrella

1716
05:29:39,529 --> 05:29:45,900
It don't matter you get arrows could hit the top of it it wouldn't matter you know walking

1717
05:29:47,099 --> 05:29:51,619
I mean you might not win any battles or anything. Yeah, eventually we'd have to advance and what are you gonna do?

1718
05:29:52,659 --> 05:29:55,400
Only one but for defensive purposes you know, we could touch it

1719
05:30:03,909 --> 05:30:07,909
Lose every battle. No, it's called only fight on your own home turf

1720
05:30:09,939 --> 05:30:17,590
Everybody does that

1721
05:30:17,590 --> 05:30:23,029
And everyone would be practicing the whole time and even like that like the waiters and waitresses and like the cook staff and stuff at restaurants

1722
05:30:23,029 --> 05:30:24,630
We're doing too

1723
05:30:24,630 --> 05:30:28,709
It's back to back walking backwards. We need to learn it's hard to do

1724
05:30:42,729 --> 05:30:52,259
What about tanks yeah, we're talking about not current we're talking about like medieval weapons stuff

1725
05:30:58,869 --> 05:31:06,090
Yeah, yes the solution if I had a phalanx right now, oh you what the fuck just snipe me from a mile away

1726
05:31:13,020 --> 05:31:15,340
Why are the shortest men the best generals

1727
05:31:17,419 --> 05:31:22,299
Uh, I think you're making a reference to napoleon napoleon lost 70 percent of every fighting with him

1728
05:31:24,340 --> 05:31:46,549
He's really good at chess

1729
05:31:53,080 --> 05:31:56,169
Wait wasn't uh, wouldn't napoleon like so good at what he did

1730
05:31:56,250 --> 05:31:59,610
They like shot him out of a cannon on an island or something and he wasn't allowed to come back

1731
05:32:21,049 --> 05:32:24,819
He came back and everybody was just cool with him

1732
05:32:30,630 --> 05:32:34,470
Why do I okay, hold on a minute i'm gonna be talking about potential

1733
05:32:36,709 --> 05:32:42,630
Potential spoilers for the marvel universe, especially a character that's very large and very green

1734

05:59:48,759 --> 05:59:51,880
Is this supposed to be happening? Is this how you beat this guy?

1902
05:59:52,919 --> 06:00:08,799
Holy shit, okay

1903
06:00:09,200 --> 06:00:21,979
Yeah

1904
06:00:22,860 --> 06:00:24,860
It's lice

1905
06:00:35,799 --> 06:01:06,700
Fast for bat jr is dead. Yeah, you still hit the ground nice catch

1906
06:01:07,979 --> 06:01:09,979
Now that's paradise

1907
06:01:18,680 --> 06:01:31,049
No more heroes too in the bag there are secret boss in this one it might be

1908
06:01:32,009 --> 06:01:58,060
I think we're off to the end of the credits. You're gonna play the third game when it comes out. Oh, absolutely

1909
06:01:59,159 --> 06:02:01,479
That was the reason to play these this year was because I

1910
06:02:02,279 --> 06:02:04,279
Knew that the third one was coming out

1911
06:02:04,279 --> 06:02:06,279
I'll play the travis strikes again, too

1912
06:02:06,759 --> 06:02:12,090
Let's see how far I get in it. That's a long game though, isn't it? It's much longer than these first two, isn't it?

1913
06:02:13,049 --> 06:02:14,250
we'll see

1914
06:02:14,250 --> 06:02:22,380
When i'm playing it is the third game going to be on steam. I think it's going to be on switch

1915
06:02:25,080 --> 06:02:27,369
exclusively

1916
06:02:27,369 --> 06:02:36,650
Right. Yep

1917
06:02:36,810 --> 06:02:40,009
Switch is gonna overheat

1918
06:02:40,250 --> 06:02:45,630
Nintendo actually funded it

1919
06:02:45,790 --> 06:02:47,790
Well, that's good to hear

1920
06:02:51,159 --> 06:02:53,159
But uh, we did it. It's over

1921
06:02:54,299 --> 06:02:56,299
So that means you know what that means

1922
06:02:56,700 --> 06:03:02,060
That means tomorrow we're going to play president evil 3 remake. I'm gonna try to beat that tomorrow

1923
06:03:03,310 --> 06:03:05,419
then

1924
06:03:05,419 --> 06:03:07,520

06:03:24,759 --> 06:03:26,759
Oh

1927
06:03:27,869 --> 06:03:29,869
No, I think that's a good order

1928
06:03:30,270 --> 06:03:46,409
That's a good order. I want tiny tunes tomorrow. No, we're doing tiny things on thursday

1929
06:03:47,450 --> 06:03:49,950
and probably uh

1930
06:03:49,950 --> 06:03:51,950
Another secret game for the super nintendo

1931
06:03:52,509 --> 06:04:14,110
No, not tomorrow. I mean thursday these credits are in the game. They're not pre-rendered

1932
06:04:19,849 --> 06:04:21,849
Please play donkey kong country 2

1933
06:04:29,639 --> 06:04:32,759
Uh, I played donkey kong country 1 pretty recently on my own time

1934
06:04:33,400 --> 06:04:35,240

1935
06:04:35,240 --> 06:04:36,919
And I rage quit

1936
06:04:36,919 --> 06:04:38,520

1937
06:04:38,520 --> 06:04:41,159
I didn't believe it was turn the lights off turn the lights on level

1938
06:04:42,380 --> 06:04:45,180
Died like seven or eight times and I was like nah fuck this game. I'm done

1939
06:04:46,060 --> 06:04:58,080
Oh, that's deep. That's deep in the game. That's level

1940
06:04:58,720 --> 06:05:00,720
That's level probably like 18

1941
06:05:20,729 --> 06:05:22,729

06:05:23,130 --> 06:05:26,400
All right. Come on. What's the secret cut scene?

06:06:04,909 --> 06:06:14,750
Oh, never mind finally here she is

I was looking for you

1948
06:06:21,360 --> 06:06:36,509

i've heard

1960
06:07:58,169 --> 06:08:02,650
Things about it. I'm gonna make my own opinion on it. I've heard it's very short

1961
06:08:03,209 --> 06:08:06,650
I've heard it's not as good as the second one remake. I've heard it's

1962
06:08:07,290 --> 06:08:11,869
For the first time, you know, i'm going in with some muted, uh dialed back expectations

1963
06:08:12,270 --> 06:08:19,860
Raise yourself

1964
06:08:19,860 --> 06:08:26,020
Done took one hit not even the same dimension as the resident evil 2 remake

1965
06:08:27,259 --> 06:08:32,130
Um, yeah, but i'll play it. We'll see we'll see tomorrow. We'll see tomorrow

1966
06:08:32,689 --> 06:08:35,569

1968
06:08:38,400 --> 06:08:40,270

1969
06:08:40,270 --> 06:08:42,860
Same place

1970
06:08:42,860 --> 06:08:44,860
Have a great night. We're gonna do the bits

1971
06:08:45,259 --> 06:08:47,259
You want to stick around you're more than welcome to

See you tomorrow. What the hell is that?

1973
06:09:01,680 --> 06:09:03,200
Why is that on

1974
06:09:03,200 --> 06:09:05,200
when I pressed outro

1975
06:09:06,430 --> 06:09:08,189
on my stream deck

1976
06:09:08,189 --> 06:09:10,189
Why is that connected to outro?

1977
06:09:14,430 --> 06:09:18,139
Oh because it was the first okay

1978
06:09:22,700 --> 06:09:26,220
That makes sense. Doesn't it? It was the image that was blown up

1979
06:09:28,529 --> 06:09:29,729
See you tomorrow

1980
06:09:29,729 --> 06:09:31,250
Let's go back and do the bits

1981
06:09:31,250 --> 06:09:34,770
Shouldn't take us very long

1982
06:09:34,770 --> 06:09:37,259
Pugles, thanks for the 300 bits. Hi

06:09:37,259 --> 06:09:41,900
I'm looking to hire an e-clown for my son's e-birthday because of the quarantine and I heard you the best around

1988
06:10:20,319 --> 06:10:24,369

1989
06:10:24,369 --> 06:10:27,090
Uh happy e-birthday whoever it is

1990
06:10:27,729 --> 06:10:29,729
Soup gg. Thanks for the soup if you apologize

1991
06:10:30,290 --> 06:10:33,490
The annoying request can you say happy birthday to my brother nick?

1992
06:10:34,500 --> 06:10:36,500
We've both been fans since like 2013

1993
06:10:36,500 --> 06:10:41,139
Thanks for the years of the funniest content on youtube and twitch. I generally appreciate it. Hey, happy birthday nick

1994
06:10:41,779 --> 06:10:46,209
Have a good night. Hope you had a good birthday

1995
06:10:46,770 --> 06:10:58,060
Two back-to-back birthdays there. Happy birthday

1996
06:10:59,330 --> 06:11:05,500
sing for them

1997
06:11:05,500 --> 06:11:06,619
Thank you

1998
06:11:06,619 --> 06:11:08,619
Smelly boy. Thanks for 250

1999
06:11:08,860 --> 06:11:17,759
Hey germbo, do we still have plans for paper mario? I promise you'll like it eventually. It's not now other things going on first

2000
06:11:19,580 --> 06:11:21,580
Opster narwhal. Thanks for the 277

2001
06:11:21,580 --> 06:11:25,340
Will you play the remastered edition of spongebob battle for bikini bottom when it comes out?

2002
06:11:25,740 --> 06:11:27,419
Did you play the original?

2003
06:11:27,419 --> 06:11:32,060
It's a classic with a capital c i've never played battle for bikini bottom

2004
06:11:32,299 --> 06:11:35,259
I will play the remaster when it comes out. Yes, absolutely

2005
06:11:35,900 --> 06:11:37,919
I never played the original

2006
06:11:37,919 --> 06:11:46,290
Hey frito man. Thanks for the 15. Everyone asks. Where are the aliens but no one realizes they are all around us

2007
06:11:46,610 --> 06:11:51,750
We travel to other stars and even galaxies. We have to go beyond reaction based propulsion

2008
06:11:52,290 --> 06:11:54,290
and manipulate space time itself

2009
06:11:54,689 --> 06:11:57,569
The achievement of this feat will then allow us to travel beyond the fourth dimension

2010
06:11:57,569 --> 06:12:02,099
We inhibit as gravity the ultimate force in the universe travels through all dimensions

2011
06:12:02,500 --> 06:12:07,869
It is through reaching this that aliens will stop hiding and reveal extradimensional existence

2012
06:12:10,430 --> 06:12:13,869
Did you just copy and paste the top part of your paper you were doing for your project?

2013
06:12:14,270 --> 06:12:23,790
Because I mean it's pretty good writing so far everyone asks

2014
06:12:24,270 --> 06:12:31,259
Where are the aliens? That's a great opener for a school paper. Great. I would have done that. I would have done that

2015
06:12:32,779 --> 06:12:36,909
Open with a question open with a where the aliens i'm your teacher. I'm now you got my attention

2016
06:12:37,150 --> 06:12:44,500
Because then I say where are they? Yeah, they're right educate me school me nobody ever asks

2017
06:12:44,979 --> 06:12:46,740
How are the aliens?

2018
06:12:46,740 --> 06:12:54,959
No, they don't thanks to the 15 dollars. You're gonna get an a hey yoda 985. Thanks for the 260

2019
06:12:55,040 --> 06:13:13,599
Hey, mr. Germa, sir, if you have one, who is your favorite transformer bumblebee? See the next thing you should ask is

2020
06:13:14,419 --> 06:13:31,139
Name another transformer optimus prime is the only other one I can think of besides the decepticon

2021
06:13:31,439 --> 06:13:37,340
But I think that's a group of evil doing robots. I don't know who

2022
06:13:38,540 --> 06:13:42,580
The omega red is that the name of the bad one? What's the bet?

2023
06:13:43,139 --> 06:13:48,590
What's the bad guy's name omega lull red?

2024
06:13:51,580 --> 06:14:03,340
No, oh man. Hold on. No, that's a that's a x-men character. Never mind. Uh

2025
06:14:05,209 --> 06:14:12,610
Megatron that's right. Okay. There you go. That's my favorite. Hey bar broski. Thanks for the 300 bits

2026
06:14:12,930 --> 06:14:15,419
Germa, is it true you minored in art?

2027
06:14:15,419 --> 06:14:19,180
If so, do you have any work available for us to see i'd honestly love to watch a laid-back stream of you

2028
06:14:19,180 --> 06:14:21,979
Just drawing for a couple hours, even if it's just funny little doodles of your characters

2029
06:14:24,029 --> 06:14:28,380
Yeah, I idea and when I would go to i'm this bad

2030
06:14:32,900 --> 06:14:38,700
In my art classes, I didn't know the hell I was doing and every time there was a project to come in with something

2031
06:14:38,939 --> 06:14:44,930
This is not a joke one time. I actually did a full project in crayons

2032
06:14:45,700 --> 06:14:53,229
Because I was too lazy to go buy all the art supplies needed to actually do the project and actually do it for real and right

2033
06:14:53,470 --> 06:14:57,900
So I did it in crayons and I the best part about art

2034
06:14:59,180 --> 06:15:03,009
Anything can be anything anything can be anything

2035
06:15:03,939 --> 06:15:09,919
So I went in there after doing a full crayon picture and I I was like, yeah

2036
06:15:10,240 --> 06:15:16,369
I did the childlike way that I used the crayons for the medium and it was like, oh shit

2037
06:15:19,500 --> 06:15:30,830
What they didn't know is I just didn't buy the supplies yet because people would come up with like this really really awesome shit

2038
06:15:31,459 --> 06:15:37,900
Well, that's an amazing like actual detailed full person's face in charcoal. All right, mr

2039
06:15:37,900 --> 06:15:45,939
Elbertson, come on up. It's my picture of a house that I did in crayons. I did it on purpose

2040
06:15:47,540 --> 06:15:50,099
Oh, you did. Yes. Wow

2041
06:15:50,900 --> 06:15:59,599
Excellent work. Mr. Elbertson. Thanks. I did it hard. It was very hard people happy

2042
06:16:03,279 --> 06:16:06,139
But there were actually some I love forget about drawing

2043
06:16:06,380 --> 06:16:09,580
I can't draw and I've I've refused to try to learn because I've tried a million times

2044
06:16:09,819 --> 06:16:13,419
I don't have the patience for it. I have no patience for it. I'm never gonna learn and I it's okay

2045
06:16:14,540 --> 06:16:22,720
I like clay. I like molding. I like sculpting. I don't like to do it, but I like I I enjoy it. I enjoy

2046
06:16:23,439 --> 06:16:29,169
Clay because it can be mushed around and molded and you can make uh, like statues within stuff

2047
06:16:29,979 --> 06:16:41,009
It's cool. And yeah, the bugleberry pottery. Yes physical media crew unite just interesting to me

2048
06:16:41,169 --> 06:16:49,069
I like the way it feels. He's never gonna draw a manga probably not

2049
06:16:56,099 --> 06:16:58,500
I did I did do it and I learned a lot

2050
06:16:58,580 --> 06:17:00,580
There's a lot of things in art history that was interesting

2051
06:17:00,740 --> 06:17:11,439
I remember not enough to tell you what they were but that I remember how they interesting they were thanks to the three dollars though

2052
06:17:14,340 --> 06:17:23,439
Hey the dinkster, thanks for the five dollars. Haha. Jerma smells. I don't actually I smell pretty good lm man

2053
06:17:23,520 --> 06:17:26,000
Thanks for the 250 jerma since you like no more heroes

2054
06:17:26,000 --> 06:17:34,340
If you consider playing mad world a disc is right behind me that actually is is it gonna be kind of sad to say

2055
06:17:35,950 --> 06:17:43,060
That is one of only I think three or four more games for the wii that I have to play on this stream

2056
06:17:43,299 --> 06:17:52,610
The supply is running dry pickman two. No, that's for the game cube

2057
06:17:52,610 --> 06:18:01,500
But still I count them both because I play it in the wii mad world what else is back here?

2058
06:18:01,500 --> 06:18:14,349
Hold on. Let me see bad world cooking mama world kitchen

2059
06:18:27,970 --> 06:18:33,259
And that's it that's it for the game cuban wii era of video games that I have

2060
06:18:34,290 --> 06:18:38,430
And then paper mario the thousand year door. I don't have that one

2061
06:18:46,380 --> 06:18:54,369
I will probably that doesn't mean we're never gonna play wii ever again, but that's just what I have now

2062
06:18:56,349 --> 06:18:59,389
A unpronounceable offspring. Thanks for the ten dollars

2063
06:18:59,389 --> 06:19:02,189
Just want to say i've been watching your streams for years through youtube clips

2064
06:19:02,750 --> 06:19:04,509
I want to show my appreciation

2065
06:19:04,509 --> 06:19:07,310
Have you thought about checking out war of the monsters?

2066
06:19:08,110 --> 06:19:10,110
Cheers. Well, thanks for the ten dollars

2067
06:19:11,150 --> 06:19:16,560
Uh, I think I think we've talked about this game before this is a fighting game, right?

2068
06:19:17,279 --> 06:19:23,069
We've yeah, we talked about this before just have to get it

2069
06:19:23,630 --> 06:19:29,779
Did they remake it or something? Why am I seeing stuff from 2015?

2070
06:19:30,340 --> 06:19:44,349
Did they put it on psn? They did right? Okay. We'll put it on the list where the monsters was a good ps2 game

2071
06:19:44,830 --> 06:19:50,509
I'll give it a try. Let's roll the credits

2072
06:19:53,169 --> 06:19:55,810
we will see tomorrow still have a few more bits to do but

2073
06:19:56,610 --> 06:20:01,680
Uh, let's run the credits credits are probably gonna be much faster than they were

06:20:02,299 --> 06:20:04,060
yesterday

2075
06:20:04,060 --> 06:20:05,259

2076
06:20:05,259 --> 06:20:07,259
Hundreds of community subs that came in today

2077
06:20:10,689 --> 06:20:15,099
The font looks smaller to you

2078
06:20:15,099 --> 06:20:16,540
The font is smaller

2079
06:20:16,540 --> 06:20:21,599
Getting more no

2080
06:20:21,680 --> 06:20:23,680
This font looks a little smaller

2081
06:20:25,540 --> 06:20:27,540

We love you fred

2094
06:21:36,930 --> 06:21:38,930
Where does he get the money?

2095
06:21:41,180 --> 06:21:50,180
Well, I mean pretty big deal

2096
06:21:52,270 --> 06:21:54,590
Hey, I don't know how much you guys know this

2097
06:21:55,150 --> 06:22:07,180
Freddy's a big fucking deal

2098
06:22:07,180 --> 06:22:23,139
Hey, go look him up one day. That's songs on spotify. That's how you know. He's supplying you cbt

2099
06:22:25,889 --> 06:22:27,330
Why did I read that?

2100
06:22:27,330 --> 06:22:29,700
I don't know. I was gonna say cvd

2101
06:22:30,500 --> 06:22:34,340
Whatever. Hey

2102
06:22:37,180 --> 06:22:43,619
Hey, zigzy zyx zii zigzy. Thanks for the thousand bits peony

06:22:44,720 --> 06:22:46,720
mvp. Yes, I agree

2104
06:22:48,669 --> 06:22:54,060
Hey goiki. Thanks for the five community subs. That's a five dollars. That's not a five community subs

2105
06:22:54,060 --> 06:22:56,060
I just saw the five and I said subs

2106
06:22:56,459 --> 06:22:57,740
It's not what it is

2107
06:22:57,740 --> 06:23:02,060
It's 500 bits if you had to dress up as someone at like comic con or something

2108
06:23:02,619 --> 06:23:04,619
For a whole day, who would you choose to be?

2109
06:23:06,400 --> 06:23:09,599
Uh the stay puff marshmallow man

2110
06:23:09,599 --> 06:23:13,520
No one would know it was me and I just walk around and get just have a bunch of pictures taken on me and be

2111
06:23:13,520 --> 06:23:15,520
In a big air conditions suit

2112
06:23:15,919 --> 06:23:17,919
So that's exactly what it would be

2113
06:23:18,080 --> 06:23:19,419
All day

2114
06:23:19,419 --> 06:23:24,369
Yeah, I get to be in the breeze of the ac unit that's in there filling up the suit with air

2115
06:23:24,849 --> 06:23:27,229
Thinking face

2116
06:23:27,229 --> 06:23:32,029
Hey rain. Thanks for the 250 jeremy. Can you please measure your foot and show that it's 10.2 inches?

2117
06:23:32,430 --> 06:23:35,229
I'm not a freak. I just want to be proven right. Absolutely not

2118
06:23:36,770 --> 06:23:42,880
Uh, that's just that's just uh, that's a that's just a no that's an absolutely no

2119

2120
06:23:52,000 --> 06:24:07,060
You know what somebody tells you show them, you know, you probably should know that it's like, uh, no, you know

2121
06:24:07,299 --> 06:24:10,580
Hey jeremy, can you please measure your foot and just prove that it's 10.2 inches?

2122
06:24:10,659 --> 06:24:15,700
I just want to know jeremy. Can you please measure your foot and show that? Oh, you want to show it?

2123
06:24:15,939 --> 06:24:29,970
Okay, see now I know hey, you're just mad at 10 point. What are you talking about rip alex rebec?

2124
06:24:29,970 --> 06:24:31,650
Thanks to the 500 bits jeremy great stream

2125
06:24:31,650 --> 06:24:36,849
Just want to update you on the status of the custom german 985 funko pops you commissioned from me last stream

2126
06:24:37,419 --> 06:24:42,400
Factories pumping them out at max speed and just the payment advance a couple weeks earlier

2127
06:24:43,500 --> 06:24:49,340
Also, they use a non-polar paint that causes birth defects. Can't wait to deliver them to you and all tax-free

2128
06:24:53,759 --> 06:24:57,200
I'm not reading the rest of this. I'm not reading the message anymore. That's what I actually believe

2129
06:24:58,459 --> 06:25:03,970
I actually yeah

2130
06:25:03,970 --> 06:25:08,159
I'm not saying that I don't want to say that like I don't want to say that

2131
06:25:11,919 --> 06:25:19,419
I don't want to say I like don't want to say those words. No, i'm not going to read it

2132
06:25:19,819 --> 06:25:26,819
They say something about them having they don't something about all right. It's the they say the irs they say

2133
06:25:27,919 --> 06:25:29,919
Gosh, darn it. I'm paying my taxes

2134
06:25:30,459 --> 06:25:36,959
And yeah, we all pay them. We all have to pay them. Welcome to life bug smoke. Thanks for the 250

2135
06:25:38,560 --> 06:25:41,840
A few days ago. I donated and talked about my first experiences watching your content

2136
06:25:42,080 --> 06:25:44,700
I wrote that I used to hate your videos before being a fan

2137
06:25:45,020 --> 06:25:46,860
That seemed to hit you the wrong way

2138
06:25:46,860 --> 06:25:50,779
I want to send this to clarify my wording before watching you

2139
06:25:50,779 --> 06:25:54,740
I just assume you were a typical tuber and that I would have hated your videos

2140
06:25:54,740 --> 06:25:57,380
Okay, that was obviously an incorrect judgment

2141
06:25:57,540 --> 06:26:02,540
I've liked all the content i've seen you do even the escape stream keep up the content

2142
06:26:02,619 --> 06:26:13,259
You mean the unlock stream? Well, that makes one of you one of us. He's a two. I'm a tuber at heart

2143
06:26:14,580 --> 06:26:21,419
All right, I am i'll always be a tuber, you know, yeah, that's not gonna grow out of me

2144
06:26:21,500 --> 06:26:34,619
I'll always be a tuber. I'm just a twitch tuber. Thanks to the 250. Glad you don't hate my videos a dream boom

2145
06:26:34,700 --> 06:26:36,700
Thanks for the five dollars. Thanks for streaming a series

2146
06:26:36,700 --> 06:26:40,189
I love did you check the extended trailer of no more heroes three?

2147
06:26:40,270 --> 06:26:46,259
I have by the way killer seven was also made by suda 51 and has a good remaster on steam check that out

2148
06:26:46,259 --> 06:26:49,139
Whenever you have the time, i'm sure the chat will love it. Keep up the great work

2149
06:26:49,459 --> 06:26:53,470
It's been on the list for a while

2150
06:26:53,470 --> 06:26:59,069
But I feel like no more heroes three will come out before I have the before I want to play

2151
06:26:59,549 --> 06:27:10,290
Killer seven I feel like that's gonna happen first killer seven's a stoner game. That's all right. Hey, it's boo

2152
06:27:10,369 --> 06:27:13,490
Thanks for the three dollars seeing you play some more suda 51 games

2153
06:27:13,490 --> 06:27:18,430
I'd like to see you play shadows of the damned for the playstation 3 his production team had a hand in it

2154
06:27:18,979 --> 06:27:21,779
Sadly, the sales weren't up to par but it was a very unique experience

2155
06:27:22,180 --> 06:27:29,040
And i'm sad to see not a lot of people have played what was the game that was a suda 51 game

2156
06:27:31,340 --> 06:27:38,459
Where at the very beginning there was this big frog boss we played it

2157
06:27:39,580 --> 06:27:48,380
What was the suda 51 game that we played with the weird frog thing in the beginning never dead. That's what it was

2158
06:27:48,459 --> 06:28:03,229
Okay, that was a marvelous entertainment game, right? That's not suda 51

2159
06:28:04,659 --> 06:28:13,250
Never dead is not suda 51. This is not never dead. Uh

2160
06:28:16,009 --> 06:28:26,400
Director no is no. Hold on. This had nothing to do with suda 51

2161
06:28:34,220 --> 06:28:40,299
Oh, I think I just thought it was a suda 51 game and it became fact in my brain. Oh, that's interesting

2162
06:28:40,939 --> 06:28:43,569
Well, yeah, i'll check it out

2163
06:28:43,650 --> 06:28:53,840
See you tomorrow. Have a good night. It's still two or three more bits. I just want to say good night to you right now

2164
06:28:56,830 --> 06:28:58,830
Convo breaker. Thanks to 250

2165
06:28:59,599 --> 06:29:06,319
Dear jeremiah, i'm sorry for causing you distress sometimes but I cannot hold back from jumping when all the chat is yelling at you blatant lies

2166
06:29:06,799 --> 06:29:08,799
And or misinformation at the same time

2167
06:29:08,959 --> 06:29:15,200
It's just too funny kind of like my addiction to picking food above the floor saying when in doubt radish it out and then eating it

2168
06:29:15,439 --> 06:29:19,360
I can't stop myself. Please help dear god. Also, I don't know how much people like jrpgs

2169
06:29:19,919 --> 06:29:21,919
Xenoblade chronicles is like chrono trigger

2170
06:29:22,720 --> 06:29:25,040
Like a chrono trigger tier jrpg in the decade

2171
06:29:25,759 --> 06:29:31,099
And I don't know what's real. It's hard to determine what's even real

2172
06:29:34,830 --> 06:29:38,240
Never played it. You know blade is a thousand hours long

2173
06:29:39,200 --> 06:29:42,659
You probably won't see it on this stream

2174
06:29:42,819 --> 06:29:44,819
There's a strong cutoff

2175
06:29:45,860 --> 06:29:50,740
On this channel where if a game is going to take more than 40 to 50 hours on paper

2176
06:29:51,299 --> 06:29:54,419
That means it's going to be one to two hundred hours on this stream

2177
06:29:55,139 --> 06:29:58,619
I don't think I have the

2178
06:29:58,619 --> 06:30:00,619
Brain to commit to that

2179
06:30:00,700 --> 06:30:09,790
But I will play chrono trigger because I know everything about it

2180
06:30:10,509 --> 06:30:12,509
Blueberry juice. Thanks for 250

2181
06:30:13,090 --> 06:30:15,569
No, you can't just use the peony for the entire game

2182
06:30:16,830 --> 06:30:17,869
uh

2183
06:30:17,869 --> 06:30:19,869
unga bunga orc

2184
06:30:20,029 --> 06:30:22,029
big pea sword oh

2185
06:30:22,669 --> 06:30:24,830
Boom, I respect your commitment to the strength build

2186
06:30:25,389 --> 06:30:29,630
Also, it's pronounced wielding not welding you illiterate stacom brained caveman

2187
06:30:30,590 --> 06:30:32,590
The other one that said the caveman thing

2188
06:30:37,439 --> 06:30:40,159
Stacom and it's fun to say too

2189
06:30:40,880 --> 06:30:45,119
Hey drumager. Thanks for the 250 what the fuck happened to resident evil 4 on wii. That was the stream

2190
06:30:45,119 --> 06:30:47,680

2191
06:30:50,450 --> 06:30:52,450
July 30th. I already said it

2192
06:30:52,529 --> 06:31:06,540

06:31:08,959 --> 06:31:10,959

july 30th

2195
06:31:18,900 --> 06:31:20,259
Pretty good

2196
06:31:20,259 --> 06:31:22,750
See you guys tomorrow for resident evil 3

2197
06:31:23,470 --> 06:31:25,470
Goodbye. Good night
