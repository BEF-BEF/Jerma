1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,700
I didn't mean to turn this on. I pressed enter on the streamlabs

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,699
thing. I have it enter as go live. Um, it's actually gonna like delay the stream to tomorrow. So,

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,420
uh, sorry about that. I, um, I, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:32,070
Hey guys, how you doing? Welcome back. Psycho.

5
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:36,390
Gotta start. I'm excited. I'm ready to go. This is WarioWare.

6
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,399
This is the week of games that I've been waiting for for a decade.

7
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:48,460
Ever since Smooth Moves, I've been begging Nintendo to come up with a new one of these.

8
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:57,320
And I don't count game in Wario. That one doesn't count. This is a WarioWare game from scratch,

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:09,769
ready to go, on Switch, fully developed, fully ready. I heard it's short, but, you know, whatever.

10
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:21,349
We'll see how short. From what I have seen, it takes anywhere from three to four hours to

11
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:26,939
see everything. We'll see. But I'm really happy. I'm really, uh, I'm really into it.

12
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,739
I think it's gonna be fun. I don't know. I don't want to give any judgments until I play it.

13
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:41,290
The new system seems a little weird. Seems kind of weird. Yeah, I'm very early. I was just ready.

14
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,760
Sometimes I'm just ready. Not every time, obviously. Sometimes I'm just ready to go.

15
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,189
That is one of those times today. Hot dog, thanks for the five community subs. Appreciate it.

16
00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:01,099
So the plan here today is we're gonna play WarioWare, and then after WarioWare,

17
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,890
it really depends on how long this game is. If this game, in like an hour or two,

18
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm done with it. It's like, oh, that was cool, but I did everything, and I did everything I

19
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,900
wanted to do. I have to, I highly doubt that's gonna happen. And I'll just do No More Heroes 3

20
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,379
tonight. If not, if this game takes at least three or four hours, and I'm having a good time,

21
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:26,680
then we'll just do No More Heroes 3 tomorrow. So you're really gonna get two short streams

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:37,060
back-to-back, or one long stream tonight. We'll find out. Thank you, AStraightPube.

23
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,250
Are you allowed to have that name? Is that at least in that busy piece of cube?

24
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:57,860
Thanks for the 10 community subs, I appreciate it. Whatever. So yeah, I'm ready to go. I think,

25
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:14,039
should we delay any longer? We're just going emote only? What happened? We did. Hey, thanks,

26
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:21,960
Spigot. Thank you, K5. Five community subs. There's a bug with huge emojis some people are getting,

27
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:34,469
trying to sort it out. Wait, what? Huge emojis? Well, let's see what happens.

28
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:42,259
WarioWare, get it together. I'm ready. There's like a character selector in this one, too.

29
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,659
And yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm gonna do a face cam. Everybody just relax,

30
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:53,449
because I'm going to be going like this. So of course, you have to have a face cam

31
00:03:53,449 --> 00:04:05,990
on for this shit. Hey Casper, thanks for the five community subs. You guys ready? All right,

32
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:16,629
so this is just, I unlock shit as we go. I can't see what they're saying. What are they saying

33
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:25,720
about me? Thank you, facade, facadecake for the five community subs, appreciate it. I'm ready to

34
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:37,449
go. How many players? One. All right, so he plays Wario. Wario intro games. Change the number of

35
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:45,269
plays. No, excuse me. You can play Metroid? Probably. No, that's a lie. I don't really play

36
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:50,730
the Metroid games as much as I like pretend to. Metroid is a series that I pretend that I know

37
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,329
anything about, because I think people would think I was cool if I knew about it. I made a tweet.

38
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,930
Here's a fun fact about my Twitter. I made a tweet like three or four years ago. I believe

39
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,800
it said something like this. It took Nintendo five years of making Yarn games to realize that

40
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,670
Metroid was a cool series. I've never played through any of the Metroid games, any of them,

41
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:21,829
not even the Super Nintendo one. None of them. So why am I making a comment like that?

42
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:30,709
I was, yeah, I was a poser. I was a fake fan. I was. I'm like, this is WarioWare. I'm ready.

43
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:36,100
That was a lie? Well, I didn't lie. I just, I didn't say, oh my god, I'm such a huge fan of

44
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,750
Metroid. I can't wait for the new one. I just made like a joke about how they made a bunch of

45
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,990
Yarn games, but I didn't play any of the Metroid games. You know, no, I went like this.

46
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,259
Come, come, come, come, come. In Metroid Prime, Wii, and then I never played it ever again. Oh,

47
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:01,500
and then I also rented from Blockbuster a copy of Metroid, Super Metroid. But it was like halfway

48
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,740
through the game and I jumped around in a circle a few times and I just returned it. All right,

49
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:15,509
let's go. It's time for Wadi. What's wrong with Yarn games? Nothing. I was just being like,

50
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:22,970
I'm just trying to be like, I haven't looked at my opinion. Oh, what's this? I can't do it like that.

51
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:30,490
I got to do it like this. No wonder I am flying. I am a fly. This is because I'm inside the game.

52
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:40,759
Ah, who cares? This is going to come. Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, let's walk out of here.

53
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,839
This video game maker loves treasure, money, and garlic. And money, what could go by? This is meat.

54
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,759
I'm kind of coming to the realization that me and Wario are on the same page.

55
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:05,910
This guy loves treasure. I love treasure. I love money. I love garlic. All right, Wario attacks in

56
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:23,000
whichever direction he's facing. Okay. It's like a dash. Move and attack. Break. Okay. Push. Push.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:41,290
Jump. Wait, can I dash? I can only dash sideways? Yeah. Defeat. Okay, push. All right. Is this it?

58
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,459
Look, I'm not going to do the voice. I can't do the voice. I can't do any voices with a cam on.

59
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:52,540
You guys know that. Because look, I know how stupid and ridiculous I look with it on. But if it's off,

60
00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:02,439
I turn the camera off. Now, all of a sudden, that's me, Wario. I can do Wario.

61
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:10,790
I'm not doing that with the camera on. It's like embarrassing to have you look at me do that.

62
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,899
Uh, this is the level I made. Oh, he made his own video game, right?

63
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,939
Okay. That thing and messed up everything it touched. I feel like I'm the voice actor

64
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,980
that replaced Wario and like I didn't care to do anything like the original.

65
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:44,179
This is bad. It's going to ruin my level. Wait. Oh, people would fucking freak up.

66
00:08:44,179 --> 00:09:16,950
Cutscene. Oh my God. Just put a bag over your head. I do like the voices.

67
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,909
That actually might work. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. The games. I got to play the game.

68
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,470
I don't, I think I failed on the first level. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

69
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:38,570
wait. That's a, that's a really good idea. Dislodge. I'm going to hide my head.

70
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,700
What a genius idea. Okay. Select all. I just punched the mic. All right. We're good.

71
00:09:51,610 --> 00:10:02,490
I've been so long since I played this. I can't wait. Mr. Wario. That's what I just said.

72
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:12,759
Young cricket. This devoted student of the martial arts diligently trains under master Mantis.

73
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:21,080
He likes meat dumplings a lot. Jumping is cricket specialty. Hold down A to perform a high jump.

74
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:33,139
Okay. So everybody has like their own like powers. Push. How high can you go? You can jump really

75
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:41,539
high. Cool. Why are you in the game? I'm not. This is 18 volt. Check it. I'm here too.

76
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,960
Get this. I can throw this disc on my head as many times as I want.

77
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,980
I know what's even better. I don't have to move, but you don't move.

78
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,629
Okay. 18 volt throws his disc in whichever direction you tilt.

79
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:13,460
They can't move. Break them all. Okay. Oh shit. This is interesting. I feel like this is like

80
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:24,870
overpowered. This is completely overpowered. He said this art sucks. All right. People just

81
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:35,669
make it when they piss me off. I just fucking. He's fun. All right. So do I have to? All right.

82
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:43,159
Time to join forces is the only way. Come on. Let's tag team our foe. Oh shit. I switched like.

83
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:56,250
All right. Cool. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I got it. I'm a rise. You match it. Oh

84
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:17,179
shit. Like that. Okay. Yeah. What am I getting? I got them apparently. Oh shit. Okay. Got it.

85
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,879
Empty. This is weird. I switched between them. It freaks me out.

86
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:36,360
Tech. All right. When I got it, this game is insane. Does it get insane? I feel like it's

87
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:56,460
gonna be insane. All right. Boss stage. Let's go. I love that part. Oh, look. Golly.

88
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:16,950
Defeat. I don't have to. There's no timer here. I'm fine.

89
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,610
Holy shit. Are his spikes come out of his head? Oh my fucking idiot. What are you doing?

90
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:53,909
You lose to the first boss. I'm fine. Look, I'm just going to get in spring things. I've died.

91
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:59,000
This is different. This is different. This plays a lot differently than the other ones.

92
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,240
It's a complete evolution of the WarioWare formula.

93
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:26,039
Oh. Hi up. Hi up. It's a Nintendo game. It's three hits. All right. That was easy.

94
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,169
The emojis are fixed. I need to like, I need to put like a bag on my head and try to do voices.

95
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:40,700
That's really important. I need to like cover my head. If you guys can't see me,

96
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I can do whatever I want. I can do voices. There you are. You can't hide from Wadi.

97
00:14:51,830 --> 00:15:02,870
Whoa. The corruption is disappearing. I bet that was a game bug. They make games act all glitchy.

98
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:09,879
Do you turn the webcam off? Okay. Why did I read that? All right. So you got to get rid of all the

99
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:15,500
bugs in Wario's game. Sounds cool. Everything moved back to normal. Yeah. I'll do like the

100
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,769
best impressions you've heard all night. Let's smash some bugs. Frickin 18 volt. Join the crew.

101
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:32,460
You earned 1000 coins for completing a level. Oh, all right. Hold on. Give me one second. Let

102
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,139
me, I, I, well, I'll do this in a minute. Let me like get to the first like 20 minutes of the game.

103
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:47,779
You want to play your pedia. You're like missions through. All right. Nice. You sleep good last night.

104
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:59,700
Yep. The PNG of Wario over your webcam. No, not that's what. No. What year is this? Let's go level

105
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:07,750
two. I wonder if there's anything to begin to shake the Wemo. It'll load this place. The bugs

106
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:16,039
really did a number on it. Hey, hello Wario. Is that you? Oh, my scooter. It won't stop.

107
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:30,340
Wario Vtuber. You know that Charles Martinet did that 12 years ago. They set him up with a camera

108
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,100
that like recorded his face in real time and he would go to conventions and he did Vtuber Mario

109
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:48,120
at conventions. That's like how it all started. The original Vtuber was Charles Martinet. The fart

110
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:56,309
music. It's Wario dude. That's not true and false. Look it up. All right. This is Mona. Work, school,

111
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:00,950
and pets keep this high school student busy. She's also a big fan of Wario. Why? Who can say?

112
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,940
Mona is always on the move so you have to steer her in the right direction. The boomerang

113
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:24,819
can be aimed the same way. You always are moving. I don't like this character. All right. This is

114
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:31,130
weird. Like I'm patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the same time. This is very weird.

115
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:40,339
This is strange. I get a raid. Oh, shit. Kit Boga raid. We got a Kit Boga raid this early.

116
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:50,500
What's going on? Thanks, Kit. What's going on? Welcome, everybody. Welcome to the stream. If

117
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:57,670
people are on my stream and you're not following Kit Boga by now, you've lost your goddamn mind.

118
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,269
Sing the raid song? No, I'm not going to sing a raid song. I'm going to do the impressions soon.

119
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,799
YouTuber raid voice. This is not a YouTuber raid voice. What are you talking about?

120
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:14,019
Look, when people hit the raid button, when you see the raid come in immediately,

121
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:23,099
I have to present myself in a way where I'm not a lunatic. Sing the raid song.

122
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:31,259
On almost just give 20 community subs. Thank you. Kit Boga is one of the funniest people on

123
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:38,490
Twitch. Go follow. How do you not know who this person is by now? They're on the dollhouse

124
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:50,650
stream. They've been got a thousand episodes. Thanks, Kit. Let's keep going. Find the bag for

125
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:59,660
your head. I will in a minute. I've been waiting for WarioWare for like the last fucking 25 years.

126
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:07,190
What a mess. My level looks awful. Bugs inside the game. Who did this? Unacceptable. Let's go.

127
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:14,539
Oh, wait, you actually pick your character. Oh, I don't want to be that. I don't want to be Mona.

128
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,259
I don't want to be that character. Who do I want to be? I think I'm going to be 18 volt.

129
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:32,519
Oh no, you pick your crew. I just, okay. I don't know. Why are you guys kind of hard? You can do

130
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:40,819
an auto. That's probably cheating, right? Here we go. You guys ready? Cut scene. Turn it off.

131
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:47,700
Remember, you look like a hotter version of Ryan Reynolds. Don't give me that. Don't stroke my

132
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,299
ego like that. That's completely false. That's 100% untrue. Why are you saying that? That's

133
00:19:53,299 --> 00:20:10,779
unbelievably false. That's not even remotely accurate. See? If I had to do that with a cam on,

134
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:48,250
it's not going to happen. Next day. These people are just fucking up our house. All right, let's

135
00:20:48,250 --> 00:21:02,809
do it. Peel. I just barely got it. All right. Aim and throw. Eight o'clock. Got it. Oh, look at

136
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:27,579
that. I love that little guy over there. Yeah. Ring. I get it. I got it, right? Ring the doorbell.

137
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:43,670
What? Hide. I rang the doorbell. Squeeze. He's so good. I just do it three times. Oh,

138
00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:09,180
oh, that's hard. I got it. I got it. That's just one side. Okay. Good.

139
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:27,210
Thank God. Watch out for the teeth. Okay. I'm good. Yeah. I don't know why I thought I was

140
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:44,819
going to die. Oh shit. I got it. I didn't even know where I was. Good thing I was flying around.

141
00:22:50,660 --> 00:23:06,980
Oh, this is, this is weird to do. Okay. Here we go. Air dryer. Mega Man jug. Boots. Backpack.

142
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:24,549
I need the Mega Man jug. I get it. Oh shit. I got time here. Missing backpack.

143
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:49,960
Bug. Oops. I tried to kill the bug. All right. I need two of these. I need two of these. I need

144
00:23:49,960 --> 00:24:08,759
one of these and one of those. I want to kill this bug. I wouldn't even odd. Remember your hair looks

145
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:20,150
good today. Can I please see my family? I need like a bag. Not even a bag. Just like a, like a,

146
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:27,660
like a towel or something or like a blanket to hide. All tidied up. Good work everyone.

147
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:39,339
Thousand coins. All right. Hold on. Let me, I'll be right back. I'm not leaving. I just, I literally

148
00:24:39,339 --> 00:26:25,910
just need one second. One second. Let's see. Let's test this. So if I was going to do Wario, right?

149
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:42,059
I don't like people looking at me. Hey, it's a me. Wario. I hate it. Hey, it's me. No, I don't like

150
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:54,539
people looking at me. Let's try this. Now you can't see me. So like I can do it. It's a me.

151
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:15,539
It's me. Wario. Oh, here I go. Here I go. That was pretty good until I freaked out.

152
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:24,500
How about Mr. Satan? I could do Mr. Satan too. It's me. No, I don't want to do it in front of you.

153
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,059
I'm going to do it. I'm going for it. Tell me which one's actually better.

154
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,339
Well, that's me, Mr. Satan. Hi, Goku.

155
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:37,259
Okay. Right. Now let's try this. Tell me which one's really actually better.

156
00:27:45,619 --> 00:27:50,900
Well, that's how I do it, Goku. It's me, Mr. Satan. And I'm going to tell you something. You're not

157
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:59,180
going to destroy Earth until I kill you, Mr. Satan, Goku. It's constructing my blood vessels.

158
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,140
It's constructing my blood vessels a little bit. I can't do it that well.

159
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,630
All right. Here's the difference. It feels like somebody's like,

160
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:24,869
all right, do some voices. It's hard to do it with the mask on. The duck was,

161
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:39,099
was the duck better? That was just Alex Jones. Was the duck actually better? I don't think it

162
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:50,390
was because I was like constricted. All right. How about this? Ready? Now I'm not constricted.

163
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,640
Well, I'll tell you. It's me, Mr. Satan. And Goku has got himself in some trouble.

164
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,569
We got to go help him, Vegeta. Hey, it's me, Mr. Satan. We got to help that Goku out because

165
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:27,079
he's in big trouble. Which one was better? Okay. Exactly. Got him gained, please. Turn the camera

166
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:37,460
off. You know, that, why, why would I, why am I doing this? I'm not sure. Maybe you should try

167
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:48,069
the gimp mask again. Gimp mask. It's like a fucking turtle or whatever this thing is. It's,

168
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,150
I don't know what this is. It's like a duck or a chicken. What is this supposed to be?

169
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:06,470
What is this creature? What is this? Is it a chicken? It's a rubber ducky. Oh, right. Yeah.

170
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:27,349
It could be a turtle like this. All right. Stop pretending. All right. We've got all the weird

171
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:32,279
shit out of the way in this stream. We can go back to normal now. It's not so bad after all.

172
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:51,289
Oh, Wario. How could you say that? All right. Let's do it.

173
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:57,299
This taxi driving duo is happy to take you from your front door to the far reaches of space.

174
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:02,839
The fear is always fair. What's wrong with them today? I'm playing Wario Ware for the first time

175
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:11,420
in 10 years. I'm a little excitable. My Tribble always fires his bazooka to the right and Spitz

176
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,940
always fires to his left. What if I'm playing with one person?

177
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:33,349
I don't. How do I change? How do I switch person? I played this last year for the GameCube.

178
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:40,099
The game didn't come out last year for the GameCube. All right. We took a look around

179
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:46,869
and there are messes like this all over the place. Game bugs must have corrupted the entire game.

180
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:59,910
Let's go exterminate some bugs then. All right. I really like, I like 18 volt. I like cricket.

181
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:19,539
I think those are my two mains. Tribble and, oh. Did you forget you played smooth moves? Yeah,

182
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:24,259
but I, I played these games before. They came out 10 years ago. This is a new one that I've

183
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:50,200
never played before. I'm obviously going to be very excited. Here we go. Close. Holy shit. Okay.

184
00:32:50,200 --> 00:33:00,230
Yeah. I didn't know if I had to shoot it. Spin it. Literally best character in the game.

185
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:19,210
Okay. Where the fuck am I? Made it. I got it, right? I can't even shoot that way. I got it.

186
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:31,269
Didn't I? Oh, I won. Okay. Cool. Put a jumpscare warning in the description when you're going to

187
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:58,599
turn on the webcam. Why is my webcam so dark? Oh, dodge. That's it. It's very easy.

188
00:34:02,539 --> 00:34:07,750
How many? One, two, three, four, five, five. There are five. No, there are three. There are

189
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:38,460
two. There's one. Okay. High five. Oh shit. I'm going to lose. Stick together. Why am I going

190
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,289
like this? I'm like leaning back and free. Do you know what I'm doing? Like, why am I doing this?

191
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:53,219
Lean in. It's not like a scary horror game. Catch four. One, two, three, four. I'm an overachiever.

192
00:34:53,219 --> 00:35:13,219
So, therefore, I get punished for it. I feel like it's going to be Wario and Cricket. All right.

193
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:34,329
Let's do it. Come on. Wario is actually pretty balanced. Oh, it's weird not being able to shoot

194
00:35:34,329 --> 00:36:05,690
that way. Stop. This isn't Smash. I'm not playing Smash. I got it. Fight me in Smash. Okay.

195
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:42,980
Dodge. Oh, calm down. This game's easier to play standing up. I don't think so.

196
00:36:42,980 --> 00:37:05,460
High five. Steal back. Steal back. Oh. Where the fuck was the raid song? This is difficult.

197
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:13,300
Okay, I got it. The raid song is from like 2019, guys. What do you want me to do? Oh shit. That's

198
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:35,349
bad. Catch four. One, two, three, four. It's from last year. It's from 2019. Protect. Protect this

199
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:54,380
little guy. Oh, what am I protecting? Unlock. Oh shit. Get it. You piece of shit. Let him go.

200
00:37:55,179 --> 00:38:25,500
Unlock the fucking door. Get up there. Get up there. Oh my god. Let him go. That was tricky.

201
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:57,699
He only shot him 34 times. Ah, now that's more like it. What can I do with money? I have a full

202
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:17,269
drink here and I forgot it existed. Ah, that's good. Dr. Crygor? What's the drink? Um, it's tang.

203
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:31,179
I love tang. Am I swimming? Am I flying? Paddle, paddle, paddle. Look at my flippers go.

204
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:42,309
Hello, Dr. Crygor. Indeed, what the gallium is going on around here. Dr. Crygor, down here.

205
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:57,429
You literally live in the 90s. I don't. I have a tang over here. By the way, I do one

206
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:02,309
scoop. I don't do the recommended two or three tablespoons. I do one tablespoon just to get a

207
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:08,630
little flavor. I, it's barely anything in there. I just, I like it. It makes, it tastes good. It's

208
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:19,369
like a light little flavor. I don't recall my level looking like this at all. How many people

209
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:28,469
are in the game? Oh, you're here too. Extraordinary. Yeah, by the way, that shit will last like a year

210
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:34,630
if you do it like that. This genius scientist is so good at making mechanical marvels he made a

211
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:41,639
cyborg out of himself. Press or hold A to make Crygor swim through the air.

212
00:40:44,659 --> 00:41:01,239
Weird, okay. So you just kind of steer around. Oh, yeah, this is weird. I don't hate it though.

213
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:15,429
By part of the game, something's gone awry. Do you know what it might be? Yes. Yes. Game bugs have

214
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:23,340
taken over. They're causing these glitches. Game bugs, glitches, wonderful. I shall be sure to

215
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,389
study them in my laboratory. I think this guy has some glitches of his own, if you know what I mean.

216
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:44,219
Okay, Wario and 18 volt. Let's begin. No, I'm not going to answer that question. It's weird.

217
00:41:44,780 --> 00:42:55,420
Handball. Light. Oh, I like that one. That was fun. Are the emojis so large? I don't know what's

218
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:13,670
going on. Oh, I just get in frame. Escape. Oh, I escaped. No, you idiot. Fine, I got up.

219
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:28,710
Assemble. Assemble. Oh, Lord, I got it a little wrong, but I got it.

220
00:43:48,340 --> 00:44:04,059
Shave your sides. Shave my sides. Like I haven't shaved in like a week. Oh, fuck. That was weird.

221
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:20,440
That's weird with him. I get it. I thought I was like, wait, am I going the wrong way?

222
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:45,940
Serve. I just spammed. I just, I smashed that fucking like button is what I did. What am I supposed to do?

223
00:44:48,119 --> 00:45:02,519
Oh, that was easy. You contoured your beard. I didn't, I guess that's how my hair goes. I didn't

224
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:26,780
contour. That's funny though. Grab. Okay. Assemble. Another sushi. I almost picked up the

225
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:45,079
telephone. Okay. That was weird. It's toothpaste. It was very, that was simple. It's time for a full

226
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,480
melt downstream. I don't think so. I'm getting all the energy out in the beginning in the first like

227
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,619
40 minutes of the stream. I'm just blowing through all my energy like in an hour.

228
00:45:54,619 --> 00:46:11,179
So don't worry. I'll go, I'll fall asleep in like 25 minutes. See, I am a genius. You earned a

229
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:22,119
thousand coins. Cool. All right. So I can only go here. Oh, Nintendo classics is my favorite stuff.

230
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:28,380
I love this shit. We're going to, we're going to get to see Super Mario 1. We're going to get,

231
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:34,780
hopefully we get to see Super Mario 2 and I hope we get to see Zelda and Metroid. This is the best

232
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:43,940
minigame. Waiting 10 years for these. All this pushing is good for my training, but can't you

233
00:46:43,940 --> 00:47:04,280
just walk a little bit? Hell. Yikes. Nine volt. My skateboard. It's skating on its own. This

234
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,719
skateboarding school kid is obsessed with Nintendo games and has some serious DJing and yo-yo skills.

235
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,420
Nine volt skateboard keeps him rolling back and forth. Press A to stop and shoot his yo-yo

236
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:34,250
upwards. So you don't even move. It's just yo-yo. It's weird. I don't control it. This one's going

237
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:52,360
to be hard. Okay. I can turn around. Nine volt is the only person that can make Nintendo fan games

238
00:47:52,360 --> 00:48:03,829
without getting a DMCA. That was, that was pretty good. That was pretty good. I like that one. What's

239
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:09,420
wrong with my level? Is it broken? Totally. There's these bugs in the game and they're chewing it all

240
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:18,469
up. Okay. Okay. And let's go get him. Nobody messes with my games. Nine volt. Okay. Nine volt,

241
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:40,699
18 volt. Let's take Dr. Kraigra. Why is he not doing silly voices? He missed the first 20 minutes

242
00:48:40,699 --> 00:49:04,389
of the stream. That was pretty much the only thing we did. Nine volts house. I think augmented

243
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:38,809
reality game. I used to watch wrestling like that and I had this tiny little, I used to have

244
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:43,849
in my bedroom, this tiny little TV. It was like a, it was an old CRT TV. So it was big, right?

245
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,090
And I used to watch wrestling, like SmackDown would be, what am I doing?

246
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:54,889
Uh, so it was SmackDown and RAW. They would, it would be 10, 11, 12 o'clock.

247
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:01,849
And I would have to go to bed. But I had to, uh, I had to watch it on an old CRT TV. So I had plugged

248
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,849
it into bed. Like I plugged it into like the, oh, let me, let me pause this because my brain can only

249
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:10,809
do one thing at a time. So I had a little CRT TV. It was like a big queue. It was a big Minecraft

250
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:17,849
block. That's how I can describe it. So it's plugged in far away in my room. It's not right next to me.

251
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,449
But what I used to do is when I wanted to watch, watch wrestling late at night, I would plug the

252
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:26,969
TV in behind like the bed, like the outlet behind the bed. And the TV would be right on an end table

253
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:34,579
right next to the bed. Or I would be holding the TV in my bed, just like this with like fucking

254
00:50:34,579 --> 00:50:40,900
Stone Cold Steve Austin on it and shit. And I would hear the like, here comes mom to check on you.

255
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,099
And there would be two things I would do it. I would like sometimes just like put it on the

256
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:50,260
fucking ground next to me and like pretend to be asleep or like put it under the covers and like,

257
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:56,070
go like this. But I had this gigantic like cube. Or I would try to turn with it like,

258
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:02,119
power off, turn it. It's like, I wonder how much my mother used to come in and be like,

259
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:08,360
you stop watching TV. I know what you're doing. The TV is normally like across the whole fucking

260
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:15,500
room. And you play, I'm like, no, I put it there before I went to bed. I turned it off at exactly

261
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,349
10 PM like I'm supposed to because I'm a good boy. It's like, oh no, you didn't. Did it ever work?

262
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:29,380
No, not once. I also, yeah, I think everybody that used to watch wrestling got in trouble

263
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:36,809
watching TV in bed. See, you don't know how lucky you motherfuckers have it now. Do you

264
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:44,119
understand me? Do you understand me? Do you know how hard it is? Do you know how easy it is for you

265
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:54,809
to go like this? It was a cube and it weighed 40 pounds and it was sitting on my chest. It was

266
00:51:54,809 --> 00:52:02,599
over the neck. Do you understand how hard it was? You guys even have brightness settings.

267
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,599
You can go, oh, I'll turn the brightness down to zero so it makes like 10% illumination,

268
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:12,010
but I can still see. We didn't have that. You're lucky you didn't get your hands stuck in the VCR

269
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:39,099
part of these TVs. The combos. Game only? No! Okay, whatever. Sumers. Who won? Oh no, no, no,

270
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:45,559
you won. Wait, what happened? I am so confused. I just pick a side?

271
00:52:49,820 --> 00:53:08,139
Oh, there's Donkey Kong. Mario? Remember, didn't have running water when he was a kid.

272
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:23,269
I'm just saying, you have, you have a TV, a game device. What am I doing? Oh wait, your phone is

273
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:42,070
everything. Yeah! I used to eat cement when he was a kid. I didn't eat cement. Spin it? Oh, that's so

274
00:53:42,070 --> 00:54:03,940
hard with him. No! Spend a hundred coins to keep playing. What do you mean? No, yeah, what?

275
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:12,139
Oh, I can just start from there. No, start over. A hundred coins. No, I'm keeping it.

276
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:42,170
Eat cement. We used to play with old tires. We used to play with old, we used to play with old wood.

277
00:54:42,809 --> 00:55:03,739
You guys don't understand. We actually had to use our tetanus shots, unlike you kids. You're

278
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:08,150
going to cut it off for the best part. Holy shit, that's one full letter grade below what I was

279
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:28,230
going to give it. I gotta be careful here. All right, what game is coming up next? This is Toad's

280
00:55:28,230 --> 00:56:09,829
Treasure Trove. I remember that. I remember that one. The game is that one. Pikmin. I remember that

281
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:42,409
one. Hey! Oh. Which is greater. Three. What? This feels like a mod I don't want to be playing.

282
00:56:43,050 --> 00:57:05,769
There's no jump. No! Wait. Okay. Ready? Go. Oh, do you like satisfying power washing video?

283
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:35,420
Oh, Newgrounds Mario Colonia. That was cool. I can't wait to do more of those.

284
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:58,940
It was a rant from what? What am I ranting about? Talk about KO. Thousand coins. Easy money.

285
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:13,110
And now what? New. This is, oh, it's a remix. First remix of the night.

286
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:22,150
Everybody just sat up in their seats. You've been waiting to eat your food because you know

287
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,269
that I'll be here for a little while. You're like, I'm waiting to get to the remix before I eat my

288
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,190
fucking chicken sandwich. I know he's going to be stuck here. I'm going to be laughing with my mouth

289
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:52,340
full of food. Minecart. Wait. Like the Donkey Kong minecarts? Be funny. Hurry up, my la la.

290
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:00,739
Be funny. My Burger King long chicken's getting cold. That's a funny joke. I know you're a liar

291
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:09,340
because they're always cold. Invented by Dr. Crygor, this karaoke robot has a great love

292
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:18,300
of singing. He does not have great skills at singing. Mike shoots notes upward from his mouth.

293
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,420
Can I fly around?

294
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:35,059
Oh, what a good observational comedy. I mean, I've had the long chicken like probably five times in

295
00:59:35,059 --> 00:59:43,690
the last three or four years maybe. I'm not sure it's been warm once. It's very good. It's been

296
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:49,449
like kind of like sometimes lukewarm. I don't think I've had a hot long chicken in like five years.

297
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:57,110
I just don't think I have no memory of that. There's no such thing as a long chicken. Do

298
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:04,230
I have to link the video again? It's the Burger King long chicken. Just type it. Just type it

299
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:10,039
right now. Type in Burger King long chicken into Google. I want you to watch this. Look,

300
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:16,090
it's like the menu pops up. That's what it's called. They call it the Burger King original

301
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:24,329
chicken sandwich, right? Whatever it is. That's not what it's called. Long chicken. The original

302
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:31,219
BK chicken sandwich. That's like, all right. That's like when a company comes out with like

303
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:37,699
a cleaning solution and it's like a new, like, oh, new formula, original BK sandwich,

304
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:47,340
original formula. No, it's a fucking long chicken and I'll die on this hill. It's so, it's so like

305
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:54,840
just, oh, it's just like just safe. Like the original BK chicken sandwich. No, I don't want

306
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:01,659
to call it that. I'll take one long chicken, please. Oh, could I have a BK original chicken

307
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:20,500
sandwich? Yeah, there goes my solo career. We're going to play with Mike and I like 18 volts.

308
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:28,550
Nine volts. I don't like that. It's too hard to play. You just say chicken sandwich, weirdo.

309
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:33,349
Excuse me. I want that person timed up with one second. There are like seven different chicken

310
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:38,340
sandwiches at all these fast food restaurants now. The chicken sandwich is like the new thing. You

311
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:44,699
have to have like four of them or five of them. Oh, I'll take the deluxe chicken sandwich. I'll

312
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:49,340
take the crispy original chicken sandwich. Oh, could I have like the extra crispy double deluxe

313
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:54,860
chicken sandwich? McDonald's now has a, on the menu. I'm sorry, we're going to take a minute here.

314
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:00,539
It's, it used to be you would order like, oh, I'll take the chicken sandwich. Now there's like,

315
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:07,260
it's like, oh, number four. There's four A, four B, four C, and it's all a chicken sandwich.

316
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,769
Every restaurant has five different chicken sandwiches now. This one's spicy.

317
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:24,619
We're just going to have a fucking spicy chicken sandwich. I love these rants. It's not even a rant.

318
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:43,750
I'm just speaking factual information to you. Literally who cares? You're right. Stop.

319
01:02:45,110 --> 01:03:02,599
This is a rant. Don't pretend it. No, it's really not. Oh my goodness. He's bad here.

320
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:20,309
Stream doesn't like choice. No, it's, it's about, look, you don't need a thousand menu items.

321
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:46,420
Make them good, not more. We did. No, I actually love like the late night menus because there's

322
01:03:46,420 --> 01:04:14,570
like seven things on it. Can I do this? How am I supposed to? Okay. I got it right.

323
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:23,300
Nara has a mac and cheese sandwich. That's for you to say exactly what you just said for all

324
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:28,820
of us to be appalled by it. And then for somebody to go make a fucking like Instagram video about

325
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:42,440
it. Like that, that's what it's for. They've won because you just said that. Oh, I don't get

326
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:58,119
that one. Oh, this is impossible with this guy. Not possible. I died. All right. Okay. Let's go.

327
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:23,940
Focus. Oh, this is awesome. He's actually mad. Why would you think I'm mad right now?

328
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:49,000
There's no timer. Yeah, there is, but it's fine. I want all the coins because it probably gets

329
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:05,739
you something. Got all the coins. You're gonna be very prideful of your chicken sandwich knowledge.

330
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:23,639
Not really. And I'm kind of just foreshadowing over here, but why the fuck would it give you

331
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:33,159
something dumb ass? You're blatantly throwing. I just, I just beat it. What are you talking about,

332
01:06:33,159 --> 01:07:09,670
man? Ooh, it's home to the island. This is Kat and Anna. Oh, this is Katana. Hey, we found you.

333
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,030
What's with all the bouncing? You look like a couple of tiny kangaroos.

334
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:21,590
We can't help it. Our legs won't stop jumping. It's probably just our super awesome ninja powers.

335
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:33,059
These kindergarteners are not only twins, they're ninjas too. That is a tiny bit older than Anna,

336
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:43,219
obviously. Kat and Anna jump non-stop. At always throws her shuriken to the right.

337
01:07:43,219 --> 01:07:56,949
I don't like these constantly moving ones. Yeah, I don't like the constantly moving ones.

338
01:07:56,949 --> 01:08:02,780
It's really weird jumping to our level. You can help us take it down if you're not too scared.

339
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:11,400
All right, let's pull out. Let's go Wario and we'll do, um, fine. I'll do nine volt.

340
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:20,729
Oh, there's another slot and cricket. That sounds good. We're not going to get a cut scene? Oh,

341
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:41,930
we are. This is the worst team. People just gave me shit by using the same three characters.

342
01:08:42,489 --> 01:09:07,430
When are you going to play Mass Effect 2? The first one? I'm not going to play any of the mass

343
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:29,590
effects on the screen. Why not? I don't, I don't want to dedicate like a hundred hours to, never

344
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:38,039
mind. I'm going to get in trouble if I talk about this. Cover? Oh, this is a cat shit. Oh,

345
01:09:38,039 --> 01:10:00,060
what the fuck? Speed. Come on. E1. That's classic. True The Flies Away. Classic WarioWare level.

346
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:29,020
What are your thoughts on? Well, hold on. First of all, we got a big chunk. Oh, no.

347
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:48,039
You didn't eat it all. Somebody wrote shut the fuck up. But it was in all capitals and they

348
01:10:48,039 --> 01:11:20,020
misspelled up. It was so angry at that one. I was right at the wire. Is it? I got it right.

349
01:11:26,979 --> 01:11:37,510
Ease. Okay. This is like a, this one's a lot of poop. That one's not hard. All right. Boss

350
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:47,159
battle. Are you going to be a dedicated Mass Effect 3 streamer? I cannot think of something

351
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:59,770
that seems more torturing to do than you want me to play Mass Effect 3 every stream. I mean,

352
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:06,979
how many times can you truly play through that game? Am I supposed to do something?

353
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:14,970
Question one. No. Who was there the most of? I don't, I don't know. I think it was the Flamingo.

354
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:22,420
Okay. If you're like speed running Mass Effect, then sure. You're going to do that.

355
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:34,310
Who was not there? He wasn't here. Just to simply be, I'm a Mass Effect 3 streamer. Question three.

356
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:41,180
No speed runs. No like new DLC or anything. Who was in pair? I don't know. I think it was this guy.

357
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:49,500
No. What are you doing? There are multiple endings. I could see like streaming Mass Effect 3 for like

358
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,140
a couple of weeks or something with like 100% of the game, right? But if I did Mass Effect 3

359
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:03,539
every day for like five years, I expect three, but I wasn't speed running it. Okay. We have Lion with

360
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:21,340
Meat, Jumping Elephant, and Sleeping Gorilla. Question one. Who was not there? No, there was

361
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:35,350
no, there was no giraffe. Stop looking at chat. Leave me alone. Question two. Who had food? Lion.

362
01:13:35,909 --> 01:14:03,640
Question three. Who was jumping? Elephant. I won. Please. I said Mass Effect 3 multiplayer,

363
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:25,659
not the regular game. I misunderstood. We did it. Mission complete. I wonder what you actually buy

364
01:14:25,659 --> 01:14:36,710
weapons. What do you spend money on? Oh, their names are Kat and Anna like Katana. Yeah. It helps.

365
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:50,920
They say it in the other game. Sports. Jimmy T. What's with this place? It's so dark and boring.

366
01:14:54,100 --> 01:15:09,289
It's rather spoopy. Are you holding your little Joy-Cons? Thanks. Okay. Here we go. Sports. Hello.

367
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:21,770
Is anyone there? Grief. Why is there a story in the WarioWare game? There was a story in the other

368
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:35,260
ones. It was a storyline. All right, Jimmy. What do you got? Jimmy T. Whether he's hitting the dance

369
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:44,779
floor or the gym, the sports loving disco king has all the right moves. Okay. Tilt to choose the

370
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:55,539
direction of Jimmy's attack. This is kind of like Wario. This is Wario, but you can go in any

371
01:15:55,539 --> 01:16:10,340
direction. Upgraded Wario. Why would I use Wario? We can fix it, but we got to take care of those

372
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:26,949
bugs. All right. I'm not going to pick Wario. Mike was good and I'll do Mona too. Why not?

373
01:16:28,069 --> 01:16:29,909
And Dr. Crygor because I like them.

374
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:42,439
There's the cam. I turned the camera off for cutscenes so I get out of the way so you can pay

375
01:16:42,439 --> 01:17:12,460
attention. This seems important. All right. There's something stuck in the fax machine.

376
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,060
There's something stuck in the fax machine.

377
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:36,569
It really is. That's just, it's Milton right there. It's the same outfit.

378
01:17:44,890 --> 01:18:21,319
Hey, DJ. All right. Boomerang. Land. That was not easy. What the fuck?

379
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,300
Oh, he's to get it. You got it. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.

380
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:48,149
Wrong direction, Andy. Uh, whatever. Nice. Reel it in.

381
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,779
Wow. Okay. I didn't, I didn't understand what was going on to the last second.

382
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:33,909
Shoot it. Oh God. Okay. Speed up. Number 10. Oh God. He was perfect for that. Audios. De-synced.

383
01:19:34,550 --> 01:20:08,229
Which one? It's not de-synced. Let's do a test. Ready? Climb. Oh goodness.

384
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:42,659
Are his feet above his head? How is he doing that? Fuck this art. This is going to be awful

385
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:50,979
when it gets to an actual remix. That's hard. And that shows up and I have to do that in like

386
01:20:50,979 --> 01:21:12,220
12 seconds. I'm going to lose every time. It's a boss level, not a normal level.

387
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:21,479
They get harder though. Can you, don't you go back and do that? I think you can,

388
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:24,199
you go back and you play these things again and they're like three times harder.

389
01:21:25,159 --> 01:21:38,649
All right. Here's Ashley. This is the Ashley. We're going to get a song.

390
01:21:39,289 --> 01:21:59,239
That's uh, let's just uh, but, but, but let's see. Kamehameha. What's it? Kameha. What's the

391
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:12,380
character's name? It's from Mario. The character from Mario, the wizard that has like the same

392
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:25,109
exact wand and the cubes. What's the character's name? Kamak. Yeah. That's a pretty cool reference.

393
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:35,689
Ashley. Ashley. Cute stuff. Doesn't like cute stuff. Expressing emotions. Unnecessary chit chat.

394
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:43,619
Likes casting spells. Food in her pal red. Ashley cast spells in whichever direction she's facing.

395
01:22:54,899 --> 01:23:01,979
Again, just a better version of Mike. This is a better version of Mike.

396
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:08,039
Mike just shoots up and just stomps some game bugs and you, you're going to help us.

397
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:19,319
Why should I? Because I said so and because fine, we don't need you anyway. Of course you do. Of

398
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:52,300
course, my buddy. And we'll do dribble and spits because they're awful. Here we go. Here it comes.

399
01:23:53,020 --> 01:24:05,079
She likes to eat her food and she has all kinds of moods. Her name is Ashley. You cast a spell on

400
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:54,409
you. Where is it? It didn't do what I said. Embarrassing yourself, Jeremy.

401
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:18,760
Holy. Okay. You got to get it. It's a thing that way a lot. Get out. Oh, get the ball out. Shit. I

402
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:46,890
got it. Get it in there. Oh, blend it up. I like that one. That's my favorite one I think so far.

403
01:25:46,890 --> 01:26:14,300
That's my favorite minigame for the whole day. Oh shit. Tang. I didn't even pick up on that.

404
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:27,699
It was very easy. I can't protect with. Oh yeah.

405
01:26:27,699 --> 01:26:35,829
I can.

406
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:50,729
All right, time for a boss battle. Oh, you're playing a kid's game.

407
01:26:52,970 --> 01:27:05,210
Okay. Would you like me to stop? Should I stop playing? Juice. Juice. Don't spill. Oh,

408
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:21,640
I don't understand. I need to fill each one of these slots? Oh, I need to juice it. I actually

409
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:47,210
physically smash it. Okay. Why is that meter doing that? Oh, that's. I'm fine. That was easy.

410
01:27:52,739 --> 01:28:02,390
Everybody's a kid at heart. Before you retire, Jeremy, please do a full beard.

411
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:14,420
I can't. It just looks like I have like wires hanging out of my face. The hairs are so

412
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:21,720
individually spaced out that it just looks strange. After another two weeks of this,

413
01:28:22,279 --> 01:28:34,489
it looks bizarre. All right. I got 10 almost 10,000 bucks. Orbulon.

414
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:49,020
Strange beards are cool. I mean, maybe. I don't like the way it looks. What's that weird sound?

415
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:53,939
Yeah. Some people can pull off beards. Some people can just pull off like a strange looking beard.

416
01:28:54,579 --> 01:29:11,590
I'm not one of them. Plus it's itchy and annoying. I hate it. I don't like the way a beard feels.

417
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:16,739
Let's try to turn the camera off. This alien insists he'll invade Earth one day.

418
01:29:16,739 --> 01:29:23,350
He's lived here long enough to know a lot about our culture. Orbulon sucks up the things below

419
01:29:23,350 --> 01:29:38,810
him by activating his beam. Okay, weird. Beam up. Whoa. I like this character a lot.

420
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:48,199
My beam of tractoring, it does not work on this glitchy yuck. Stuff won't go away until we take

421
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:58,060
out those mean old game bugs. See, then Orbulon will dispose of these bugs with style. We're

422
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:11,579
doing Ashley and Ashley, Jimmy. I did a mustache for the one stream and I couldn't do it again.

423
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:36,569
I already like this music the most. When are you going to play Mass Effect 3

424
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:47,130
Alternate Appearance Pack DLC 1? What a living hell. That's so stupid.

425
01:30:54,869 --> 01:30:58,710
That would be my stream title too. Checking out the huge new update.

426
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:15,270
Commander Shepard has a green shirt this time. The developer studio t-shirt. Make it flow.

427
01:31:16,229 --> 01:31:21,859
Commander Shepard with like the game studio t-shirt that you can put on.

428
01:31:21,939 --> 01:31:29,100
I would lose my fucking mind. Match? I don't know what happened.

429
01:31:32,789 --> 01:31:43,449
I can't even stream the same game like two or three times. It was a Christmas miracle

430
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:49,529
that I was able to stream and play and make videos of TF2 for as long as I did.

431
01:31:50,170 --> 01:32:01,340
That's the only exception ever. Ice cream. Oh shit. Was there a spoon in it? No.

432
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:18,220
It just got burnt. What happened? Oh, whatever. I didn't get it for a second but now I do.

433
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:49,779
Ring the bell. Ring the bell. What the fuck? Oh, do it. God. What the fuck?

434
01:32:49,779 --> 01:33:22,409
I love these ones. Come on. Get over there. I love when you mix the colors together.

435
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:29,590
Don't waste your money. What's the point? This team might not be very good either.

436
01:33:30,390 --> 01:34:02,899
Shit. Okay. I got it. You're a sad little man. All right. Nice. I got it.

437
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:25,829
I'm going to steal your bread if you don't tell me your skin care routine.

438
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:35,579
Okay. It's called turn the shower on. Put your shampoo in your head and then go like this.

439
01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:58,119
And like get it all over like everywhere. Make sure your eyes are closed. Your mouth is closed.

440
01:34:58,119 --> 01:35:02,979
Oh, this one sucks. Okay. I got it. You just shampoo, shampoo, shampoo. Then you go after

441
01:35:02,979 --> 01:35:08,340
the shampoo runs dry, right? When it runs out and it runs clear. Just hold your face up to the...

442
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:18,500
Hold your face up to the shower and just go like this. He distracted me and it caused a

443
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:37,210
problem. Do it. No, you just use like seed fill. You're fine. I'm kidding. Just use like a little

444
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:56,489
gentle cleanser like seed fill. That's all you have to do. 35 in one shampoo. 35 in one shampoo

445
01:35:56,489 --> 01:36:00,810
would be you brush your teeth too. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. We got to talk about that.

446
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:09,460
Let him pass. Come on in. Imagine putting shampoo in your hair, letting it run down into your mouth

447
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:17,060
and brushing your teeth with it. And then it keeps going down and you put it under your armpits and

448
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:34,489
it's a deodorant. Let's kill somebody. What happened? What was that? Let him through. Let it pass.

449
01:36:51,739 --> 01:37:14,600
Oh, okay. I get it. They were going to crash into each other. I got something in my nose.

450
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:31,720
Oh my god. There's like an animal in here. What do I do? But they're going to crash into each other.

451
01:37:32,439 --> 01:37:48,779
It's like, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out. Why would it tell? Why would it

452
01:37:48,779 --> 01:37:58,180
tell me that? There is a beam that's like caution, caution, caution, oncoming car, caution, caution,

453
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:12,710
caution. Why is there a caution? If I'm driving on one side of the road, I don't get a bunch of

454
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:22,329
caution signs. Let's say, watch out, another car is on the other side of the road. What's the caution

455
01:38:22,329 --> 01:39:19,859
for? Get out of here. Get away from it. Last one. I'm not going to watch it. Get the animal out of

456
01:39:19,859 --> 01:39:39,430
your nose. I will eventually. Go pee break? Yeah, I will in like 15 minutes. At the two-hour mark,

457
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:49,699
we'll do a first break. I'm fine. Conquer the game, bugs, then conquer the world. Thank you Segata

458
01:39:49,699 --> 01:39:53,220
for the 10 community subs. I missed a bunch of other subs too. We were in the middle of ranting,

459
01:39:53,699 --> 01:40:01,020
ranting and raving. But thanks. Thanks for the subs. Thanks for the 10 community subs.

460
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:17,939
I believe this is remix two. Two hours drink. I've got, I've got a drink right here. I'm good.

461
01:40:18,659 --> 01:40:29,109
This is full of water and a little bit of tang. I'm hydrating. I'm good. Another mine cart. I'm

462
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:35,659
going to take Orbilion. I like them. Do you like the game so far? I do, but so far it's very easy.

463
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:40,659
I think I'm going to eat those words, but it's very simple so far. Very easy.

464
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:44,260
I'm really hoping that it gets much more challenging in the near future.

465
01:40:45,220 --> 01:40:59,449
I remember smooth moves. Some of those remixes were insane. Yeah, I think it's going to be hard.

466
01:40:59,449 --> 01:41:07,529
I know it is. Unacceptable. You know better than to wander off by yourself. It's not safe.

467
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:17,109
Oh my, getting upset makes me so sleepy. Like what's up with your mom and your other mom?

468
01:41:17,909 --> 01:41:24,199
You have these out of body experiences, I guess. Your mom's got spooky moves. Hey, that's weird.

469
01:41:24,199 --> 01:41:36,380
I dig it. Five volt. While there's nine volt, she's as sweet as can be until she gets mad.

470
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:43,640
Her out of body anger is positively shocking. Five volt warps to wherever her spirit takes her

471
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:58,149
and emits a powerful shock. She can't warp to certain areas. Okay, weird. Yeah, I think I'll

472
01:41:58,149 --> 01:42:08,789
get used to it and then I'll probably end up liking it. We'll see. She can't move. There's

473
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:15,460
no jump or anything. Just teleport. All right, we're going to get the cutscene here.

474
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,300
I want to just use the overpowered characters. Let's go with Mike and Wario

475
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:32,579
and 18 volt. You can't just use the OP characters every time. Oh shit, there's no cutscene.

476
01:42:33,460 --> 01:43:10,010
No cutscene. Did I fuck it up? I think I broke it. I got it. She's actually pretty good. Does that

477
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:20,600
count? How do you jump through when you have a teleport? What? I can't, there's no jump through.

478
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:44,060
I like not having to move. Shit, too much. Okay, we're good.

479
01:43:50,630 --> 01:44:29,270
Why do I sound like Patrick? I sound like Patrick. All right, speed up. Oh, she's weird.

480
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:41,460
She's weird to use. It does sound like Patrick.

481
01:44:57,079 --> 01:45:08,340
I'm a master. All right, here we go. What's her boss? I'm not more of this juicing, juicing

482
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:19,619
shit. I can't even talk. I don't want to do the juicing. This actually kind of sucks with her.

483
01:45:25,539 --> 01:45:47,579
Jump with the B. I'm missing a lot. No. Oh, we're at critical levels. The shit's moving around.

484
01:45:48,460 --> 01:46:11,750
And that's it, right? That's hard with her. It's weird. All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

485
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:35,399
I think I figured out the strat though. Yeah, I got it. He's gonna wait till there's two over.

486
01:46:35,399 --> 01:47:17,779
Don't. Stop. No. Fuck. No. No. God damn it. My last try. Last attempt. I just watched your

487
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:24,409
Thanksgiving dinner stream. This was a while ago. That's like one of my favorite streams.

488
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:31,989
That polarized the community so much. That's some people's least favorite thing I've ever done and

489
01:47:31,989 --> 01:47:38,649
some people's most favorite thing I've ever done. People genuinely hated that stream and they were

490
01:47:38,649 --> 01:47:54,149
like, don't fucking do that shit. I hated it. It's like, all right, I would do it again too.

491
01:47:54,949 --> 01:48:10,979
It's my last chance. Seriously. I got stung by the B. What? I didn't think that was even possible.

492
01:48:11,619 --> 01:48:14,489
I'm spending 100 fucking coin packs and I'm going again.

493
01:48:49,720 --> 01:49:17,819
Pop it. I'm not gonna scream. What am I fucking 10? Pop. That's it. Okay, game over. I win.

494
01:49:27,979 --> 01:49:47,640
No, the meter is going so high. Game too hard? Game is not too hard. You haven't seen hard yet.

495
01:49:49,850 --> 01:50:01,079
That's coming up pretty soon. How many more characters are they going to introduce in the

496
01:50:01,079 --> 01:50:15,350
game? Let me see. Go back and play the old levels. I'm curious. Let's see. So if I go back to, let's say,

497
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:40,020
all right, like Dr. Crygore, right? What happens? Yeah, I've already seen this. So what happens if

498
01:50:40,020 --> 01:51:05,880
I play this again? After this, you should play one of the other, make a match. Oh shit. Can I

499
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:12,380
grow back? What does it play? Rhythm Heaven. I played it. It's one of my favorite games. Look,

500
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:41,130
green, green, purple. Pop on. Huh? I was paying attention. All right, I'm good. I got to get at

501
01:51:41,130 --> 01:52:08,340
least 20 to 30 on every level. I like that video. Heart to Zombe, that one. What? I thought it was

502
01:52:08,340 --> 01:52:27,899
a spade. Wasn't it a spade? I'm confused. 11. I got to get to at least level 20 to 30 to 50.

503
01:52:46,710 --> 01:53:00,810
Green? A pop-up ad? What was that? Oh, I'm at the boss stage. What the heck? Do we keep going

504
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:27,109
after this? This game looks fun. It is fun. Itchy. I think we keep going after this. Okay,

505
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:45,399
so does it keep going? Yep, it does. Bonus stage. Uh, wait. I haven't thought. Oh, it's just a

506
01:53:45,399 --> 01:54:23,109
collect game? No, we keep going. That's right. I knew it. What did it explode? What did it explode

507
01:54:23,109 --> 01:54:30,069
for? I lost. Now I'm paying some fucking in-game currency. I'm paying in-game currency. Oh, I can't.

508
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:50,899
All right, I'll go back to it. Wario. Now we're getting somewhere. This is the last level I made.

509
01:54:51,699 --> 01:54:56,710
This is story mode, guys. There's like a ton of shit to do. There's much corruption here,

510
01:54:56,710 --> 01:55:14,939
a great amount of much. What is that thing? It's taking over my game. We've got to stop it.

511
01:55:16,859 --> 01:55:20,140
It's four more characters. Yeah, what are you guys doing? This is just like the little story mode.

512
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:30,069
They get you tutorial to get you going. All right, it's five people. Bobulon, Mike, Ashley,

513
01:55:31,029 --> 01:56:21,699
18 volt and five volt for the wild card. He's like possessed. That's kind of scary.

514
01:56:35,079 --> 01:57:00,979
Credit card. Where's the key? All right. What? What's happening? What the fuck? I had to pull it.

515
01:57:00,979 --> 01:57:09,319
I was trying to pull the damn thing. This is an awful character to have. This character is not

516
01:57:09,319 --> 01:57:21,430
good. That was a very bad character. Three, one, four. Is murder legal in the Mario universe?

517
01:57:35,399 --> 01:58:27,289
Okay, I got it. I lost. My mouth keeps going like, she's good. She's really good, actually.

518
01:58:27,289 --> 01:58:59,850
That's really good. Oh, all right. Get this out of here. This guy sucks. I can get rid of him.

519
01:58:59,850 --> 01:59:12,619
The one thing he was good for is right there. Oh, fuck.

520
01:59:26,779 --> 01:59:40,789
There we go. Which one travels in the ocean?

521
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:54,060
It's too much for my brain. No, I don't want this guy for the boss stage. Maybe I do.

522
01:59:56,409 --> 02:00:45,720
Chase. What? What happened? Go. What? Oh, it's on a rock they can break. Can I do it?

523
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:10,409
Oh, I hate this guy. All right. There we go. Okay. All right. Finally.

524
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:22,819
It's going to be so much easier with this character. It's so much better.

525
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:29,720
This is simple. I can literally just go to the edge of the screen and press A.

526
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:50,699
Okay. That was much easier. Here we go. Just dodge it. Just watch out for the rocks.

527
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:14,180
Wind. Be careful. Capture. No, I don't want this guy right now.

528
02:02:17,859 --> 02:02:28,460
Chase. It's just capture and then points at the thing. I thought I had to catch the damn thing.

529
02:02:29,020 --> 02:03:27,350
I don't have to destroy them. I hate this. Let's go. Okay. Capture. Oh, that's it?

530
02:03:27,989 --> 02:04:03,079
That's such a bait. I like the toilet character though. That was cool. Wario. Anything goes.

531
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:11,560
I just beat the tutorial. This is where it gets a little bit more tricky.

532
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:28,359
I have to get at least 25 on most of the levels of my choosing. By most, I mean three. And by three,

533
02:04:28,359 --> 02:04:40,630
I mean one. And by one, I mean I'll see you tomorrow. I need to get at least 25 on the remixes.

534
02:04:40,710 --> 02:05:02,979
At least 50 on one remix. I gotta get at least 50 on one remix. I am the supreme developer.

535
02:05:04,300 --> 02:05:08,949
I watch over this game, you might say. I'm the one who brought you here. Yes, that was all me.

536
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:13,909
I'm supreme who? Come on. Everyone knows Wario's number one.

537
02:05:15,989 --> 02:05:22,149
The game bugs arrived quite uninvited. Almost as uninvited as your parent doing Wario reading a

538
02:05:22,149 --> 02:05:27,289
book with Wario in it to their three-year-old son or daughter. They knew not what to do,

539
02:05:27,289 --> 02:05:33,239
so I brought you here to help. Thank you for tidying up their mess. Difficult work,

540
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:47,210
I'm sure. Now your home is right this way. I'm gonna shuffle on out of here. Come back and play

541
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:59,060
anytime. That's it. Oh, here's the ending cutscene. I'm not done. I'm not done. I want to get at least

542
02:05:59,060 --> 02:06:06,760
like 30 or 40 or 50 on some of these. I want to dial it up. I want to get intense. That was the

543
02:06:06,760 --> 02:06:40,279
tutorial. We make games, I make money. Wario programs with java script.

544
02:06:46,760 --> 02:07:04,020
Someone's missing. Who's missing? Oh no. We must rescue them.

545
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:21,369
Not over. This was just the beginning. All right, thousand coins. Very cool.

546
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:28,970
You now can walk to the end anytime. You unlocked a variety pack in the main menu.

547
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:49,060
All right. New. Scary mode. Looks like it. All mixed up. All right, I'm gonna do this one and

548
02:07:49,060 --> 02:08:00,060
then I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'm gonna blow my nose. You've returned and so soon welcome.

549
02:08:00,699 --> 02:08:07,029
Seems some of our friends are still stuck inside the game. Three of our friends, you gotta help us.

550
02:08:07,829 --> 02:08:13,750
Yes, of course. I shall check. Yes, strange. It appears they have been captured by something.

551
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:19,829
Oh, come on. I thought we took care of the game bugs. This is not the word of a game bug. Wait,

552
02:08:19,829 --> 02:08:25,399
oh dear. One of you friends is nearby. All right, something tells me they're in this tower.

553
02:08:33,239 --> 02:08:42,090
Someone, anyone help? Red, what have you done now? Actually, I knew you'd come to rescue a little

554
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:50,220
old me. Red, sometimes he seems to be more scaredy cat than demon. Still, Red takes good care of his

555
02:08:50,220 --> 02:09:05,060
fave witch Ashley. Have bombs? That's a little weird. I kind of like it though. There's a delay.

556
02:09:05,779 --> 02:09:15,270
There's a delay on them. Cool. Okay. You see where this big thing went.

557
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:25,510
Pretty sure it took this elevator up to floor 18. Do we have this more people to unlock? All right.

558
02:09:26,619 --> 02:09:49,300
Obi-Lan, Mike, Ashleigh, okay. Let's go. We're himself not scared. Simple with this guy.

559
02:09:53,819 --> 02:10:11,960
Oh, get out of the way. I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it,

560
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:14,279
I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it, I don't get it,

561
02:10:14,279 --> 02:10:17,840
I don't get it. Oh, you know what? That was embarrassing. Oh

562
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:23,479
It's very embarrassing if I had to connect to the left side. I thought I had to connect it to the left side

563
02:10:24,119 --> 02:10:26,119
It was embarrassing. It's fine. Take a peek

564
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:37,760
We got away frog walk. I love that guy. Why can't that be a warrior wear character? Oh

565
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:50,420
Was that technically a goal I don't think so

566
02:10:51,220 --> 02:11:04,989
No get under the tongue get under the tongue

567
02:11:05,869 --> 02:11:09,390
These are hard. It's uh, oh

568
02:11:12,529 --> 02:11:14,529
I'm fine. This is gonna be hard

569
02:11:20,119 --> 02:11:29,529
Cool car. Give me a fucking break

570
02:11:48,069 --> 02:11:49,590
Five

571
02:11:49,590 --> 02:11:52,750
I'm so proud of that. Five. I know that

572
02:11:53,789 --> 02:12:16,659
That is it. Did I do it? I did it. All right time to pee

573
02:12:19,220 --> 02:12:27,409
Don't pee right after this cutscene. What the heck that thing jumped out the window from floor 18

574
02:12:28,449 --> 02:12:32,479
Drop something what's in there olden beehive

575
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,600
Treasure all right. We must not lose focus. I forgot I still had that emote

576
02:12:38,159 --> 02:12:42,239
We must not lose focus time to rescue the other two

577
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:48,189
All right, I gotta be

578
02:12:48,189 --> 02:12:49,710
I'll be right back

579
02:12:49,710 --> 02:15:14,979
See you in a second. Okay. Hello

580
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:18,430
I'm trying to come back a little quieter nowadays

581
02:15:18,909 --> 02:15:21,729
Is the compressor on my mic when I come back?

582
02:15:22,130 --> 02:15:25,710
I'm just loud here. I am I feel like I scared the shit out of people

583
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,800
All right, we got a super hard

584
02:15:37,439 --> 02:15:41,789
Super hard, I feel like this is gonna get impossible, but whatever

585
02:15:43,939 --> 02:16:00,510
I'm doing a lot of like dancing today and like moving around. I feel like I have to do that when I play these games

586
02:16:01,229 --> 02:16:03,949
whenever I have the two joy cons in both hands like this

587
02:16:04,750 --> 02:16:07,470
I need to like be like

588
02:16:07,470 --> 02:16:09,149
like moving

589
02:16:09,149 --> 02:16:11,149
Because I feel like I'm not connected

590
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,520
This keeps me

591
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:15,039
like sane

592
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:16,800
Having to go like this

593
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,640
When you let me go like this

594
02:16:18,720 --> 02:16:23,199
I'm just like I can move around I can do anything I want I I need to be like held down like this

595
02:16:24,829 --> 02:16:26,590
Look at him. Look at him go

596
02:16:26,590 --> 02:16:29,020
I'm tired of waiting and fell asleep

597
02:16:34,209 --> 02:16:37,409
What do you got?

598
02:16:37,409 --> 02:16:41,809
Uh mantis is a master jumper. He's so good. He can jump onto the ceiling and walk around up there

599
02:16:41,809 --> 02:16:43,809
That's gonna be I don't want to use this guy

600
02:16:44,049 --> 02:16:57,799
He's weird

601
02:16:57,799 --> 02:17:02,059
Untethered

602
02:17:02,059 --> 02:17:04,620
All right, super hard. Let's go. What how many do I need 18?

603
02:17:06,129 --> 02:17:10,219
Or 10 that's it

604
02:17:10,379 --> 02:17:12,379
only floor 10

605
02:17:17,659 --> 02:17:29,809
It seems like it's gonna be simple. Nope. It's fast, but I wanted to 10

606
02:17:30,690 --> 02:17:43,180
I can definitely get 30 or 40 at least on one of these

607
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:54,239
Oh take it out

608
02:17:59,899 --> 02:18:01,899
Oh, okay seeks shelter

609
02:18:08,129 --> 02:18:12,209
I'm fine. Stop overreacting. It's not just over so I'm acting like that

610
02:18:13,170 --> 02:18:18,500
Because the camera's on and i'm like trying too hard like i'm trying to argue the camera's on

611
02:18:19,299 --> 02:18:33,549
See I have the reverse problem when I play games

612
02:18:33,709 --> 02:18:34,030
Okay

613
02:18:34,030 --> 02:18:37,790
Instead of voice impressions if the camera's off I can do voice is better, right?

614
02:18:38,350 --> 02:18:43,229
But when the camera's on I have this like obligation to overact. You know what I mean? Like

615
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:45,950
I don't do that when the camera's off

616
02:18:46,590 --> 02:18:48,750
Like oh something crazy just happened. Whoa

617
02:18:49,469 --> 02:18:50,750
Whoa

618
02:18:50,750 --> 02:18:53,149
Stop, why am I doing that? I don't do that in real life

619
02:18:53,870 --> 02:18:57,459
I'm like doing like a tuber react because I know you're looking at me

620
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:00,959
Okay toilet paper roll

621
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:08,540
Although actually some of it's real actually most of it's real

622
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:12,620
That's actually pretty cool treasure

623
02:19:14,219 --> 02:19:26,500
Streamer syndrome digging in the ground. It's actually all real

624
02:19:29,629 --> 02:19:32,110
But it's the thing like okay, so I go like what the

625
02:19:34,030 --> 02:19:37,790
Whoa, like I have to go harder because I see myself over here in the preview

626
02:19:38,350 --> 02:19:40,670
So it starts off as a normal like fuck

627
02:19:41,469 --> 02:19:43,309
It's like I look over it's like

628
02:19:43,309 --> 02:19:44,909
Fuck whoa

629
02:19:44,909 --> 02:19:48,510
And I have to go harder because I like oh, that's not good enough. I gotta go harder than that

630
02:19:51,920 --> 02:20:03,700
Real right block that part of the preview

631
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:06,700
It's so small. I can't even like see it

632
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:16,370
Please don't scream. I'm trying to sleep

633
02:20:16,530 --> 02:20:24,129
We talked about this last week, but it's like when the mirror is there. I just have to stare at it

634
02:20:24,850 --> 02:20:26,850
I can't help it. I just like oh what if what I would look like today

635
02:20:27,809 --> 02:20:30,049
We already did this joke a week ago

636
02:20:30,850 --> 02:20:35,829
Uh press a to make lulu float upward. She can perform a ground pound from mid-air

637
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:42,680
Okay, anytime it's gonna do it

638
02:20:43,159 --> 02:20:49,780
Doesn't go all the way down

639
02:20:49,780 --> 02:20:53,600
Uh, I don't like it. All these new characters don't like except for the bomb guy

640
02:20:54,319 --> 02:21:00,079
the narcissist in the pond

641
02:21:00,159 --> 02:21:03,920
What's the narcissist in the pond? Is that like a story?

642
02:21:07,510 --> 02:21:09,590
Only four or five they make it as easier and easier

643
02:21:23,969 --> 02:21:25,969
guys from staring at their own reflection

644
02:21:52,319 --> 02:21:54,559
Good bomb is perfect there

645
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,959
Good

646
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:17,360
Hey swiglo. Thanks for the five community subs. All right, so obviously I have to go through these and

647
02:22:18,399 --> 02:22:31,440
Once I unlock everything there's only one life. Yeah, only five levels though. That's not hard

648
02:22:34,790 --> 02:22:37,129
You don't know boppities and you don't know narcissus

649
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:49,540
Put all the treasure together

650
02:22:49,540 --> 02:22:51,540
Okay, how are we supposed to put all this junk together?

651
02:22:52,930 --> 02:22:55,170
beehive toilet paper mug

652
02:22:56,129 --> 02:23:02,469
What does that do?

653
02:23:02,469 --> 02:23:04,950
All right, let's see if even my granddaughter penny can be of assistance

654
02:23:06,399 --> 02:23:08,319
Mario has a granddaughter

655
02:23:08,319 --> 02:23:26,840
Can't wait to see what happens next. I thought that was the grinch. It's not the grinch. That's a different character entirely. Okay

656
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:30,799
pennies mix

657
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:52,610

659
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:14,959
Mario did this already try harder next time

660

Um

661
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:38,479
You shrunk yourself down

662
02:24:38,479 --> 02:24:43,520
To like go into the thing into the game when osmosis jones did that 15 years ago be better at everything you do

663
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:57,860
Tilt to aim pennies water blast with the recoil mover in the opposite direction of the water. Okay move here

Oh boy, okay. It's a continuous spray

And I can hover

666
02:25:06,879 --> 02:25:11,139
I forgot the webcam was on and I definitely looked crazy right there. I was just like

667
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:13,940
This is why I don't have the webcam like

668
02:25:22,659 --> 02:25:24,659
She's hard to use

669
02:25:42,239 --> 02:25:59,430
Oh, it actually did this like fucking 10 years ago. That's how you guys treat me. It's hard

670
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:26,020

They're taking like pictures of each other and stuff

675
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,920
They all have backpacks

676
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,159
And they're all very happy to have to be wherever they are

677
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:18,770

You're kidding. Oh, there's nothing at all, but I can't end like this

718
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:10,959

1007
03:08:40,500 --> 03:08:43,059
Wario also wants all the junk food like a donut

1008
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:57,040
Okay. Um, what about the meat?

1009
03:08:57,840 --> 03:09:00,399
Wario eats like food. He's like hungry all the time

1010
03:09:03,090 --> 03:09:09,030
Toilet paper too, right? He loves the toilet paper

1011
03:09:11,940 --> 03:09:12,819
and

1012
03:09:12,819 --> 03:09:14,899
Definitely the meat

1013
03:09:14,899 --> 03:09:20,559
He loves the meat. He loves toilet paper. Remember that piggy bank. That's a good idea

1014
03:09:22,579 --> 03:09:29,079
Oh, yeah, that's probably it all the sports stuff has to go to uh, jimmy, right?

1015

03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:50,899
Let's do like player two smash brothers mara wario

1017
03:09:51,540 --> 03:09:59,329
There we go. It wouldn't be yellow

1018
03:10:03,809 --> 03:10:06,129
All right. So who else let's see who's who's the wedding dress?

1019
03:10:08,399 --> 03:10:11,600

03:10:19,250 --> 03:10:21,250
Five volt really okay

1023
03:10:33,670 --> 03:10:36,950
More stuff. All right, uh, let's go to give me

1024
03:10:38,069 --> 03:10:40,770

1025
03:10:40,770 --> 03:10:43,459
I thought he would like it more than that

1026
03:10:54,309 --> 03:10:55,750
anything else

1027
03:10:55,750 --> 03:10:57,750

04:26:22,090 --> 04:26:24,090
Maybe it was pink poop. I don't know

1444
04:26:25,049 --> 04:26:37,680
Holy shit, it's so hard to do that. Uh, yeah

1445
04:26:40,200 --> 04:26:42,360
And how do you do that with this character by the way?

1446

Some of them have guns some of them don't have guns

1521
04:58:30,080 --> 04:58:34,430
One more I mean it and i'm gonna watch i'm gonna do it fucking backwards

1522
04:59:26,810 --> 04:59:46,490
It looks like it was the same color as the other one. I'm gonna okay. This is my okay. That's it. I'm out of gas i'm gone

1523
04:59:47,450 --> 04:59:52,729
I'm literally out of energy i'm done i'm toast i'm it's like i'm cooked my goose is cooked i'm done

1524
04:59:57,479 --> 05:00:01,560
Okay, when I got to 47 that was literally six months of my life that I just deleted

1525
05:00:02,439 --> 05:00:13,770
It's gonna happen. It's gonna happen right now

1526
05:00:39,639 --> 05:00:43,400
Three no, not four. I didn't want to hit it more than what I didn't want to hit it

1527
05:00:43,400 --> 05:01:05,549
What

1528
05:02:02,400 --> 05:02:07,500
That one doesn't count it actually doesn't that one actually does not count you're right

1529
05:02:13,310 --> 05:02:25,119
That one doesn't count that was just a warm-up

1530
05:02:25,119 --> 05:02:35,099
Please

1531
05:02:56,580 --> 05:03:01,040
What

1532
05:03:01,040 --> 05:03:03,040
I fucking hate it

1533
05:03:03,040 --> 05:03:55,069
Maybe you should try easy

1534
05:03:55,069 --> 05:04:12,110
Damn it. I've got people to feed here. You love helicopters. Take it

1535
05:04:14,529 --> 05:04:18,299
You go higher than president

1536
05:04:18,299 --> 05:04:19,819
presidential suite

1537
05:04:19,819 --> 05:04:23,150
Let's do like

1538
05:04:23,150 --> 05:04:27,520
You like cameras? No. No, you don't really like cameras that much

1539
05:04:32,529 --> 05:04:44,819
Uh

1540
05:04:51,279 --> 05:04:53,279
Wait, you're the 47th floor guy

1541
05:04:54,080 --> 05:05:08,450
Ooh headphones

1542
05:05:08,450 --> 05:05:15,229
What do you like?

1543
05:05:15,229 --> 05:05:18,110
How about a shower cap?

1544
05:05:18,669 --> 05:05:24,369
47 is good, but certainly not 50

1545
05:05:27,169 --> 05:05:28,369
Oh, yeah

1546
05:05:28,369 --> 05:05:37,180
That's what you think

1547
05:05:37,180 --> 05:05:45,759
Okay, that's what that's what you think

1548
05:06:13,040 --> 05:06:17,459
I don't understand that one

1549
05:06:19,060 --> 05:06:23,220
I'm done. I'm out of matter. I'm leaving

1550
05:06:23,860 --> 05:06:41,490
Okay, how about we just go with the fuck face team because it doesn't matter i'm not gonna win so let's do whatever

1551
05:06:42,290 --> 05:07:03,549
Here we go. Not bad. Oh, I get it now

1552
05:07:13,819 --> 05:07:23,919
No doggy

1553
05:07:24,639 --> 05:07:36,849
She's holding a what I thought I was talking about me

1554
05:07:46,669 --> 05:08:00,029
Okay, that's enough, um, that's enough i've had enough i've had enough one more

1555
05:08:00,669 --> 05:08:02,669
This is my final attempt

1556
05:08:03,150 --> 05:08:06,990
the last one if I don't get it here then I am going to

1557
05:08:09,330 --> 05:08:13,250
Walk out last one. This is the fuck. This is literally the last one if I do another one

1558
05:08:13,250 --> 05:08:19,270
I will literally okay if I do another one after this I will give a thousand community subs, okay?

1559
05:10:13,659 --> 05:10:15,659
I

1560
05:10:20,299 --> 05:10:22,299
Couldn't tell the difference

1561
05:10:36,990 --> 05:10:42,540
I have to stop

1562
05:10:42,540 --> 05:10:47,330
God damn it. God damn it. I want to do it so bad

1563
05:11:18,779 --> 05:11:19,979
Yes

1564
05:11:19,979 --> 05:11:26,020
All right, so i'm not gonna do that one right that but i'm not i'm not gonna do that one again

1565
05:11:26,900 --> 05:11:28,659
I can play the other one

1566
05:11:28,659 --> 05:11:31,419
I can do this one

1567
05:11:31,419 --> 05:11:38,259
It's for this one. It's not for the it's not for any of the other levels in the game

1568
05:11:44,639 --> 05:11:48,560
Double or nothing for five more attempts. No way, dude, that's five thousand sub

1569
05:11:50,180 --> 05:11:51,700
I'm not doing that

1570
05:11:51,700 --> 05:11:57,759
I'm not doing that

1571
05:11:57,759 --> 05:12:02,080
Okay, but does that count? I need I need to like a general consensus. Does that count?

1572
05:12:02,959 --> 05:12:04,959
If I were to do a different level

1573
05:12:04,959 --> 05:12:14,209
That doesn't count. It's only that crazy one that i'm trying to get 50 rounds on

1574
05:12:15,740 --> 05:12:17,740
No, i'm just gonna play

1575
05:12:17,819 --> 05:12:22,740
I'm done. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm gonna play no more heroes three tomorrow

1576
05:12:23,630 --> 05:12:28,909
And then when I beat no more heroes three tomorrow, it's only gonna take like a couple hours to get through that

1577
05:12:29,069 --> 05:12:31,069
I'm getting to 50 tomorrow

1578
05:12:31,069 --> 05:12:39,180
I'm getting to 50 tomorrow after no more heroes three

1579
05:12:48,189 --> 05:12:51,540
Well, what should I give this for a rating?

1580
05:12:52,259 --> 05:12:54,240
um

1581
05:12:54,240 --> 05:13:01,520
Okay, here we go. Is it so the rating of this game?

1582
05:13:02,720 --> 05:13:05,919
First of all, thanks to the subs everybody all the resubs all the new subs all of you

1583
05:13:06,400 --> 05:13:14,909
Some of you might be brand new some of you have been here for 10 years. Thanks guys. Really appreciate it

1584
05:13:16,099 --> 05:13:21,299
Maybe we'll see you tomorrow for no more heroes three finale and uh get to level 50 in super hard on wario wear

1585
05:13:25,119 --> 05:13:28,939
I'm gonna get some food. I've been okay. Well here you go. I've had a lot of fun with it

1586
05:13:29,500 --> 05:13:31,500
I still want to play so that's a good indicator

1587
05:13:32,459 --> 05:13:35,819
Uh, it was probably like a six and a half or a seven out of ten

1588
05:13:36,860 --> 05:13:43,659
until I realized that you could collect those coins and feed your

1589
05:13:44,299 --> 05:13:55,389
Crew I think that became a solid eight something after that like an 8.2 the actual video game. I think

1590
05:13:56,270 --> 05:14:00,990
It was a little short, but I think was the other one. I feel like the other one was longer

1591
05:14:01,389 --> 05:14:04,189
I feel like smooth moves was a longer game

1592
05:14:04,830 --> 05:14:11,069
Just with more mini games and stuff. Maybe i'm just completely wrong, but um, I think it's really good

1593
05:14:20,860 --> 05:14:22,459
I'm like i'm watching this cutscene

1594
05:14:22,459 --> 05:14:28,220
What am I talking about? I'm talking about warrior wear smooth moves being a longer game than this one

1595
05:14:28,540 --> 05:14:39,599
I remember playing it for a little longer. They have insanely short story, but tons of post game shit

1596
05:14:39,840 --> 05:14:42,639
Yeah, I think I'd have to play it a little bit more to figure that out

1597
05:14:42,880 --> 05:14:50,669
This one seems it has like daily challenges and stuff. That's really cool. Yeah, I think it's it's great

1598
05:14:51,700 --> 05:15:02,130
Way better than game in wario by a thousand times this game has about 20 more micro games than smooth moves

1599
05:15:02,369 --> 05:15:05,919
You know what? I think it is. I think that like the wiimote

1600
05:15:06,770 --> 05:15:10,130
Moving around the wiimote and doing stuff with the wiimote felt a little more involved

1601
05:15:10,770 --> 05:15:15,009
Than jumping with a 2d character to like turn a knob with your character on the screen

1602
05:15:15,250 --> 05:15:21,759
I think that's maybe what what i'm thinking of there when i'm seeing it like that

1603
05:15:23,919 --> 05:15:27,380
I I think the concept is great. It's actually a really really cool concept

1604
05:15:27,380 --> 05:15:38,290
It throws your brain off even more than the original games. Yeah, i'll see you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Goodbye

1605
05:15:38,770 --> 05:15:44,299
Tomorrow normal heroes 3 finale by the way, if you haven't seen normal heroes 3 and you want to play it yourself

1606
05:15:44,779 --> 05:15:49,979
Be careful on tomorrow's first couple hours of the stream because it's literally the last like two or three hours of the whole game

1607
05:15:50,380 --> 05:15:53,490
So we'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Goodbye

1608
05:15:54,270 --> 05:15:58,430
My voice is shot because i've been screaming it's literally been a scream stream. I hope you've been enjoying it

1609
05:15:58,669 --> 05:16:01,939
I hope you've been enjoying it. Yes. That's what I was trying to say

1610
05:16:02,500 --> 05:16:04,349
I'll see you guys tomorrow

1611
05:16:04,349 --> 05:16:06,979
Good night. Goodbye

1612
05:16:06,979 --> 05:16:46,590
See you later
