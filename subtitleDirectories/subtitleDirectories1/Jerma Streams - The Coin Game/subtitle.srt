1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,750
I typically greet everybody in the live audience, so I typically greet, but today is going to be a

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:13,900
little different. If you're watching the VOD right now, welcome to the VOD. Welcome to this piece of

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:20,899
recorded content. Those of you that couldn't watch live, welcome to the stream. VOD watchers.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:33,829
Everybody else? You get greeted every day. Well, three days a week, four days a week. Sometimes

5
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:46,659
we have to reach out to the VOD watchers, so say hello to them right now. How you doing guys? How

6
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:57,429
are you? Welcome to another stream. I'm looking forward to this one. I did not realize what this

7
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:05,219
game was until I really took a look at it. We're playing like a Chuck E. Cheese simulator today.

8
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:17,239
This is going to be probably my favorite game of the year. I'm not going to lie. This is an arcade

9
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:29,030
simulator where you go into an arcade and you try to win tickets. My voice sounds deeper? If it is,

10
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:39,700
probably is. Sometimes I get a little froggy. It'll perk up. Don't worry. I should play Gary's mod.

11
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,680
No, I played Gary's mod like 15 times in like 2013. I think that was all I needed to do.

12
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:59,370
You sound like you're about to cry. No, I sound like a broadcaster in the car. Maybe I should

13
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,829
try out for NPR. We all know the criteria for trying out for NPR. We're being on NPR.

14
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:16,090
It's sounding like you're just a little too close to your microphone. I should get the job.

15
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,310
Anyways, it's called the coin game. I am a little froggy this afternoon, am I?

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,919
I promised I wasn't at like a football game yesterday screaming.

17
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:40,699
That's what I did on my days off. Yeah. I had painted my whole body the color of the team and

18
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:48,389
just was screaming at the other team. But anyways, tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow

19
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,800
because I have a meeting tomorrow for the carnival stream. So that is really picking up now.

20
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:14,330
So we'll go along today. Chat is moving so fast. Chat's moving so fast. It really is.

21
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:20,009
But I do want to reiterate one more time something I mentioned a couple weeks ago is that

22
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,449
streams are going to have to pull back a little over the next four to six weeks.

23
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,969
I'm trying to do double time here on this. But there's a lot of moving parts on this stream

24
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,169
in particular that I'm going to give you the company explanation as to why there's going to

25
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:42,569
be like three streams a week rather than four company explanation. Very let me get close to

26
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:48,889
the mic to make sure this is really taken for real here. Company consideration. Reasons why.

27
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:56,759
Thank you for listening. Anywho, let's go. I've already tweeted. I've already got like the

28
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:07,349
fucking frog voice. Here it is the coin game. The footlong sub is no longer five dollars.

29
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:18,439
I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Subway is going to close forever within 10 years.

30
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,629
I just I'm just telling you that this is what I think to be the truth. So instead of so the

31
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:36,920
footlong sub is gone. Subway is going to be gone. It's not going to happen. Trust me. Ten years

32
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:44,540
from now, they'll get replaced by Bank of America's. Don't worry. Here we go. Choose your player.

33
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:52,779
Hold on. Male clothing. Let's see. Can I have different kind of clothes? That's me.

34
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:04,170
It's a locked button. I got to get the unlockable clothes. Well, that's not without the glasses.

35
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:12,009
That's me. I don't wear. I'm no, I don't do horizontal stripes. I'm just white t-shirt

36
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:21,290
and jeans guy. Yeah, that's fine. A birthday mode? What? There's a survival mode and a

37
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,149
birthday mode. A birthday party just for you. Fun and relax so you can just play the games.

38
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:34,250
When money runs out, just hit up the money grabber. Teleport around an island from smartwatch.

39
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:46,230
No health? No. What do you mean this health? No curfews or parents. Oh no, it's not ready.

40
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:57,860
In survival, you work odd jobs to scavenge to earn money, pawn your prizes and get cash.

41
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:07,300
My parents just don't understand. Your rich uncle Phil has rented the arcade. You can act like the

42
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,240
brats that you are. Go ahead. Money's no object. Also, feel free to check out the entire island

43
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:24,259
and your... Stop. Hey, kids, relax. Everybody's going to get $5 worth of tokens. There's no reason

44
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:31,050
to scream. No one's going to get any more than anybody else. All right. Now settle down.

45
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:37,160
That's when you throw all the tokens in the air and like all the kids, they start freaking out.

46
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:49,220
Everyone's trying to grab as many as they can. See? All right. Let's go. Does it delete any saves?

47
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,860
Oh, that's fine. Let's rile up these kids. Okay, kids. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no. Everyone's

48
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,459
going to get the same amount of tokens except for there's going to be one person that gets

49
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:15,750
10 extra tokens. If they can scream the loudest starting right now. I could be like, I could,

50
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:25,029
I could rile up like people. It's like the first thing you don't... I'm the person that the parents

51
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:33,019
are like, the worker at the place is just like, uh, hold on. This is the worker. Happy birthday.

52
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:43,449
Rowdy. Enter here. Click grab? Wait, this is a new text message. Tab is to look at your text.

53
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,720
Happy birthday, kid. Hey, thank you for purchasing the coin game. We're extremely grateful. Well,

54
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,730
this is Uncle Phil. Being a new favorite time waster. You can always refer to this menu for

55
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,170
all your received messages and all info about the current game. Below this message,

56
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,370
you'll find a small helper message that explains a little about how to use the player controller

57
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,629
in machines. If you enjoy the game, please consider giving a positive review on the steam store page

58
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,670
and help further development of the coin game through early access development.

59
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:21,529
Thanks, Uncle Phil. I ain't clicking that. I'm not going to click that. Uh, smartwatch tutorial.

60
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,810
Let's just take a look at this real quick. You've obviously found the smartwatch menu and know how

61
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,610
to read the messages. Here you will find five menus that will help you through your coin game.

62
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,740
Okay. So the info menu. Uh, so the top left to check the balance of your health remaining

63
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,899
curfew time and job. We don't need to do that. That's not in the game yet. Coin balance,

64
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,519
tickets and bus pass balances. Okay. So that's like our top left of this one's balance.

65
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,899
It's really all we need to know because we're on birthday mode. Uh, you must eat and drink

66
00:08:49,899 --> 00:09:01,990
to keep this up through the day or you will die. Why can you die in this game? That seems a little

67
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,409
much. I'm going to say. Yeah. Yeah. We don't, this is all survival stuff. We're not doing that.

68
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:13,129
It's not ready. All right. This is the messages. This, uh, menu will write you, right? It'll store

69
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,529
all the messages from the game. You cannot delete them. Right. Map menu. This is the top down

70
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:36,309
mini map of the whole island. I'm going to click it. What? Why is this so big? This seems very

71
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:48,230
elaborate. Larry's arcade. Okay. Well, so that's, uh, yeah, it has a little major locations marked

72
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,789
for you to explore, including your current position and the current position of the

73
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:56,309
Islandville bus and all seven bus stops on the island. You can also check the progress

74
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:01,029
of delivering papers by checking the amount of red mailboxes that have yet to be delivered.

75
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,779
Okay. Uh, 12 spot inventory backpack for you to carry things around the island. Simply click

76
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:12,820
the pick up button on an object to add it to your inventory. Right. And then click the image of it

77
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,639
in your inventory menu to drop it. Okay. Simple. Once it is full, you have to drop an item in order

78
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:25,639
to have a new one. And then these are stats. Got it. Uncle Phil, you need some more money.

79
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,820
You need some more money. If you run out of money, you can always go into the VIP birthday

80
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,019
room and get them in the free money blower machine. I took care of Larry and told him to

81
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:50,250
make sure it is full whenever you need any money. What the fuck? Imagine, imagine being like the

82
00:10:50,250 --> 00:11:01,000
janitor here and you just see the kid. Hey, hey, uh, hey, janitor, uh, Joe. Yeah. You got to fill

83
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,490
up the money machine. Uncle Phil's little shit. Kid's going to go in there and just grab hundreds.

84
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:20,059
Okay. Like what? What? Just to put, just, just put it in his checking account. You don't have to do

85
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:31,100
this shit. Barry's pawn shop. Come on down to Barry's pawn shop located at the flashing yellow light

86
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,179
in the main hallway, main highway. We'll buy anything. We also have a vending machine for you

87
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,059
hungry young whippersnappers. Take the bus to stop number five and we are right across the street.

88
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:48,919
Open 24 hours. Okay. All right. I think I understand how it's going on. Let's go.

89
00:11:53,799 --> 00:12:17,139
The audio is a little low. Okay. Key F inventory. What? Can I, can I pick this guy up? Wait, why

90
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:23,379
can I, I can drop already a full letter grade. Oh yeah. It's a full letter grade already. That's

91
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:33,299
cool. Why would I be able to do this in this game? How old am I supposed to be?

92
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:53,740
Zoom out? Press tab to lean forward. Wait, why is there a, why is there a gun?

93
00:12:59,370 --> 00:14:06,019
Is there, oh, it's a beach. Why is this sub training? GPS is just like, well, you're in the

94
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:14,409
middle of the fucking ocean. Whoa. Oh, we found the wall. This invisible wall. We found it.

95
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:47,320
Phil, Phil, I need help. I don't have, I do have a flashlight. What the fuck did I just shoot?

96
00:14:50,100 --> 00:15:25,659
Am I still in the water? What's that noise? You hear that? Follow the moon. Where's my GPS? Okay.

97
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:39,289
How do I just read, let's just read it again. Your golf cart has been towed to your home garage.

98
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,830
Oh wait, that's right. I can't teleport because this is the joke mode, right? This is just the

99
00:15:45,830 --> 00:16:01,269
birthday mode. Oh, it's that easy. Wow. Okay. What? All right. There's too many things to look at

100
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,230
here. Let's go. Let's go. Hold on. Look, there's a construction yard over there.

101
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:39,129
I'm supposed to be playing ticket games. Where are we going? Wait, is that, that thing's moving

102
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:50,340
around. Can I take the truck? If I can drive this truck, that'd be pretty awesome actually.

103
00:16:50,340 --> 00:17:22,119
I can't drive the truck. What the hell? What is this? Power. What? Why can I do that?

104
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,910
Is it police? Why is this an open world like beat up pedestrian game? I don't understand.

105
00:17:34,470 --> 00:18:04,789
It's my birthday. Oh, thank you. Thank you everybody. No, no, no, no. Thank you. What? I

106
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:11,079
love this. This is awesome. I wanted to go to like Dave and Buster's too. I was thinking about it.

107
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:16,759
I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese. There's like, there's like five Chuck E. Cheese's. All right.

108
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:23,799
Which one do I want to do first? I don't have to go anywhere. This is perfect. Okay. How do I play?

109
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:31,450
I have to scan my Chuck E. Cheese card. Am I supposed to be a robot? Yeah, I don't know.

110
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:38,779
I have like normal hands. All right. So I got 50 bucks. How much does it cost to play?

111
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:54,170
A dollar to play? Shit. Here we go. 20 tickets. 50 tickets.

112
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:09,529
Very, very loud. That hurt my head. Try again. No, I'm going to flip. Let me see the other ones.

113
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:14,119
How much? So how many tickets do I have? How did I get zero?

114
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:37,829
Nope. 70 tickets. All right. Hold on. I'm going to get stuck here. I know I am. But let me like

115
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:48,410
drop that audio. It's too loud. Sound effects. That shit was just out of control. What about

116
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:55,319
this one? How much is this one? Drop coin with E. Aim. This is just one of the coin pushing games.

117
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,900
I'm going to irritate people so much because I'm never going to leave. I remember Kim and I one

118
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,779
time went to an arcade and we became like psychotically obsessed with these machines.

119
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:17,019
We sat there for like three hours. Okay. So what am I going to go? I want to get the money thing,

120
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:34,420
right? What do you mean we? Yeah, no, no, that was very much a we scenario. How can you be bad at

121
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,099
the coin game? I'm not bad. What do you mean bad at coin game? How many, how many credits?

122
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:52,539
How much did this cost? A dollar? There's a game show in the UK based off of these coins.

123
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:05,099
It's stuck. I have to, how do I shake the machine? Can I punch the machine?

124
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:14,309
All right, here we go. I have to get at least one satisfying push.

125
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:27,559
Fuck. It's going to take a while. I got to get bingo. There it is. Single?

126
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:33,539
That makes what? Oh, it's coins. Coins.

127
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,500
Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Coins. All right, hold on. Here we go. This is going to be

128
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:59,660
satisfying. Watch this. Almost. I got to tell Kim about this one. Come on, get it. Come on.

129
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:08,730
I got to get that S. I'm not going to leave until I hit the S. Wait, this might be good.

130
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:23,799
Got it. Five bucks. It only just crunches as loud as it can in your ear. Okay, we're good.

131
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,829
Five dollar bill in there. Why am I, I'm just holding the tickets. All right, I didn't get the

132
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:46,200
S. So I, final push. No, no, no, no, no. Put the money back in. I want to do it again. Do it again.

133
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:58,410
Yes. Okay. I'm up right now. I want to get the stapler, whatever that is. Get the fidget spinner.

134
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:14,920
I'm going to, I'm going to clean this whole thing up. I need that S. Give me the S. Give me the S.

135
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:25,539
I just need the S so that I can move on after I get the fidget spinner. Got it. Okay, here we go.

136
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:37,980
Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. Oh man. 40 tickets. All right, what's that, a walkie talkie?

137
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,039
Yeah, it is really fucking loud. I'm going to, I'm going to do you guys a favor here. Hold on.

138
00:23:48,309 --> 00:24:00,039
I'm turning it way fucking down, like way down. And then I'm going to turn the music up. That

139
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:27,369
should help. How's that? Better? No, it's too low. How about that? That's probably a little bit

140
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:34,299
better. Wait, wait, where, where am I going to get the lighter? Why is there a Zippo lighter in like

141
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:43,190
a kid's Chuck E. Cheese? I don't understand that. $2.50. All right, let me get the fidget spinner

142
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:54,819
and then we can get out of here. Let me get coins one more time. And so the kids can smoke.

143
00:24:54,819 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm going to get a lot from here. Nice. Come on, do it. Do it again. Lighter? It's a, what do

144
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:20,549
you mean lighter? It's a, no, that, that's a, like a nail file. The other thing was a lighter.

145
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,789
Got it. Okay. Something big. It's not that bad. Just put, put the lighter back up there. Did I

146
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:38,140
take it? I need the fidget spinner or chat will literally never let me leave. Don't you understand

147
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,779
guys, this community, if I don't get the fidget spinner six months from now, someone's going to

148
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:51,339
have their username be German lied about the fidget spinner. You understand? Like people will

149
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:54,140
say, Hey, when are you going to get the fidget spinner? Are you going to like go back to the

150
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:02,819
coin machine to get the fidget spinner? And I'll be like, no, and it'll just become a thing. I have

151
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:15,059
to get that. It's already taken. So you see somebody is preparing. There's no way in hell

152
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:21,079
that somebody could have made that username as fast as I just said that. So somebody was already

153
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:32,470
preparing. My point has been proven. I don't even need to say anything else. I just have to get this

154
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:45,930
stupid fucking fidget spinner. Oh, that was, that was the mother load. How many, how many tickets

155
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:58,549
is that? All right. I almost got it. I almost got it. There it is. It's right there. It's so close.

156
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:06,700
Got it. Yeah. All right. Now nobody can say shit. Now you got to remake another new username.

157
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:26,329
Get the knife. I already got the knife. That's just hanging on. Hold on. Look at this. How many

158
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:39,609
tickets are coming off? I just want to get the middle one. I don't even care. It's a dollar.

159
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:43,609
I have $55. I'm just going to span. I got it. Okay. I got it. That's all I wanted.

160
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:53,500
I don't want anything else. By the way, this is the worst strategy when you're playing one

161
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:01,980
of these machines. I'm going to get coins again though. All right. Something big. Oh my fucking

162
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:18,299
God. Oh my fucking God. I did it. Okay. Let me see if I can get the middle lighter again.

163
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:30,519
Strategic drops here. Got it. Come on. Look at that. Look at that. Perfect drop.

164
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm pretty good I think. I think I cleaned out that one. All right. What else is there? Cool.

165
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,480
How much money do I have? 60 bucks. I got more than what I came in with.

166
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,940
My investment in Chuck E Cheese is going pretty well. Oh shit. Right. How many tickets?

167
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:10,859
That's a lot. I literally played Big Bass as a kid. Yeah. What does he say? What is it? I got

168
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,460
it in my head somewhere. It's in there somewhere. Oh yeah. That's a good fish now. Something like

169
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,980
that. What is it? It's here somewhere. Let me find it. Come on. It's in there somewhere. Oh,

170
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,339
don't you know that's going to be a big pull now. It's going to happen. Just trust me. It was

171
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:54,950
something like that. Did I do it? Hold the handle. Oh. 15 tickets. Come on. This thing's expensive

172
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:00,069
too. It's always the most expensive thing in the whole arcade. How much is it? It's a dollar. All

173
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:13,829
right. Let's do it again. Oh, you got yourself 40 tickets. I have to find one on YouTube and I'll

174
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:21,099
play it. Oh, 40 tickets. Don't you know? No, this game is a scam. Fuck this game.

175
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:46,299
No, I don't want to see like an actual Big Bass. Let's see if I was right.

176
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,549
Does it? Come on. Let's see what she can do here. Okay. Let's keep an eye on things.

177
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:59,589
I just want to hear. No, I want it. Now this is YouTube. This YouTube channel is about playing

178
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:53,319
arcade games. I didn't even know that. Big Bass arcade voice. Do it. Oh, you got 100 tickets. I

179
00:31:53,319 --> 00:32:05,720
told I was right. No, no, I'm not playing that one. Give me my tickets. Let's get the hell out of

180
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,119
here. I remember this one. Wait, let's see. We got to go in order. I can't just run around like a

181
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:25,819
child. In order. Treasure in the sand. 50 cents for one. I never played this one before. How does

182
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:43,829
this one work? Use joystick to move arm and knock off coins. Like what? What's my time limit?

183
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:52,549
This is just like a bunch of hit markers. I just called in like the AC 130 in Call of Duty.

184
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:12,420
Okay, game sucks. I don't want to play it again. Dumb. Oh, don't go. What do they got here?

185
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:29,859
It's a coin machine. I like that. I'm gonna get the cards and I'll be fine.

186
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:40,119
It's another one. Yeah, but these ones are fun. I can only get one dunko with three cards and then

187
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:59,990
I won't do it ever again. Come on. Give me the dew. Got it. Got the end. Oh, perfect. Yes. All right, 500.

188
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:11,380
I'll take 60 tickets. That sounds good to me now. Be a good sport. Play again. He does that too. We might have to

189
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:35,110
listen to that. Oh, you got eight tickets now. But honestly though, that machine. Fuck that machine.

190
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:39,989
That machine's stupid. Not because it's in this game. Like it's cool to have that in the game.

191
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:45,940
That thing is always like six bucks. It's like four to six dollars to spend that thing

192
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:59,400
at every arcade I've ever been to. All right, I'm gonna get them all right here. You know, they make

193
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,860
these for adults in Vegas. They don't make this shit like this in a slot machine. If this was real

194
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,230
money, that would be pretty fucking fun. No, I don't want to sit there and spin like the one-cent

195
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:23,530
machine. I want to put like quarters in here and have the quarters come out. Oh, come on. What'd I

196
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:32,309
get? Dunk again. Yeah. But what did I get? What was that? Was it just eight tickets? Eight tickets?

197
00:35:45,000 --> 00:36:03,079
Yeah, I know about pachinko machines, but hold on. All right. Aren't pachinko... Can't you not do it

198
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:07,559
with real money? Isn't it kind of like you pay and you get like these balls and you can get...

199
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:15,699
You can essentially do the... It's like ticket redemption. Yeah. Imagine these were just like

200
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:32,619
silver dollars in here and you got them. I don't know what those are doing. All right, let me go

201
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:42,420
for this last one. Yeah, some casinos in Vegas still have the old coin machines, but they're

202
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:53,260
not a thing anymore. Come on. Shit. All right, I'm giving up. I don't care about it. No, I don't care.

203
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,940
I don't care. So look, I set it up. I set it up for somebody else. Some lucky kid's going to come

204
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:12,820
over and get that. No, I've set it up for somebody. What's my inventory? I have an empty backpack.

205
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:23,260
How's that possible? Anything good? No. All right. What's this? No, that's rankings. It's a ranking

206
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:52,869
system. Hold on, guys. I'm trying to open a jar. Hold on. I can't do it. I'm trying. Kim came in.

207
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,469
She wanted me to open a jar for her because I'm trying to get strong, but I'm not strong enough.

208
00:37:56,469 --> 00:38:04,579
I'm trying. No, I can. I can do this and I'm going to do it. Hold on. I need like a grip.

209
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:16,059
Yeah. Give me that. Give me that thing. Face cam. I don't have any clothes on. I can't put a face

210
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:34,260
cam on. I'm going to get this. Yeah, I got it. All right. You're welcome. That was fucking impossible.

211
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:52,039
Thank you. All right. What would we do? Mountain Dew. Is that what we're going to get? How much

212
00:38:52,039 --> 00:39:01,380
these cost? Oh, I can get one of these. You can actually, can I drink them? Oh, which one? I always

213
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,559
go right in the middle because for some reason, everybody that uses these machines, they do the

214
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:11,429
first two or they do the bottom two. So you know how you get, that's not that. Wait, hold on. I'm

215
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:16,679
just coming to a realization here. If nobody presses the middle button, doesn't that mean that

216
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:22,519
the freshest ones are not in the middle? You should always do the top one because that's one

217
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:44,329
that gets filled, right? Fuck. I've been doing it wrong the whole time. Jesus. Well, you slammed

218
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:53,769
that one. Do you guys do redemption here? Can I get five cents for this? What the hell? Oh, no,

219
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,610
no, no. I'm not ready for that yet. One point ticket. Oh, wait. Ticket redemption center.

220
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh yeah. That's right. You put this in and then you feed the tickets in.

221
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:21,579
169 tickets. Cool. All right. Oh no, not this thing again. This, that thing seriously ruined

222
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:33,659
my entire childhood. Prize master. Wait, there's a show going on in there? Not yet. Not yet. Hold

223
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:37,909
on. Wait, I need to play the games first. Oh, isn't it? Yeah, this is the one we have to push

224
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:50,679
the thing perfectly into the slot, right? Okay. Let's try it. How does he, how do you start it?

225
00:40:51,239 --> 00:41:08,519
Start it. How do I go up? Oh, what? No, no, no, no. Okay. So you have to move it and then you have

226
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:24,219
to hold to, and then you have to release. All right. Let's do it again. Right there. Shit.

227
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,409
This is fucking expensive. This is really expensive.

228
00:41:49,260 --> 00:42:08,980
One more. Get it? It's right there. I can do it. This is actually the worst machine in the

229
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:13,929
whole entire arcade play. It really is. They also do have one where you blow up a balloon

230
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,250
and you never play that one either. I don't even know why that's in the arcade.

231
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:41,750
No one touches it. I think that's it. I got it. How much is it? How many tickets? Oh no,

232
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:55,289
I don't want to play again. 100 tickets. What a dog shit prize for five bucks.

233
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:05,960
Just wait, just wait till you guys get the chance to play this one. I can't wait for that. It's

234
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:20,090
going to be so much fun. All right, let's go 500 right here. You got to let me do the thing

235
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:30,550
where I turn and look into the side like everybody does. I think that's it. I think I got it. Which

236
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:49,179
one is that? 10 tickets? Come on. Do it again. Just watch the edge. I should be able to get it.

237
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:21,190
Well, I broke it. I broke it. Hey, I got a free game. You notice that? I'm going to get that one

238
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:33,619
right there. 500 tickets. I got it. Oh, sick. Thank you. Why am I doing this so many times?

239
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:49,400
How many times am I going to do this? Another 500. 500,000. It seems easier than it should be.

240
00:44:49,960 --> 00:45:00,150
There's a hundred over here. Why do I get to do this so many times? Give me the hundred.

241
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:14,780
The claw is actually clawing things. I know. Weird, right? Wait, what? I have to actually pick them

242
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:28,789
out of here? Get out. It's 500. It is 500. It's 500. Get out of here. Somebody just said that's

243
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:39,449
five. No, it was 500. Get out of here. It's my birthday, not yours. I know this one, too. This

244
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:49,800
one's awful. Okay, let's do this one. Same deal, but with rings. Let's try to get the hundred in

245
00:45:49,800 --> 00:46:05,909
the corner. I think now. No? Well, I'll take 25. You piece of shit. I'm just going to go in. I'm

246
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:10,420
going to try to feed it through the middle of these two right here. There's a 50 right there,

247
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:19,659
too. It might work. Let's ring it through. Come on, get like four of them. Oh, this is a freak out

248
00:46:19,659 --> 00:46:29,050
scenario. If I was a kid, aw. You pick up three things at the same time, you are more likely to

249
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:45,849
get struck by lightning than have that happen to a claw game. Nice. All right. Should be able to

250
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:53,480
feed through. What's the green? Is the green 500? Oh, shit. All right. I'll take the hundred.

251
00:46:54,199 --> 00:47:01,239
The green's 500. Get the green. Oh, no, no more. I got enough. I got enough money.

252
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,210
Yeah, this one sucks. I'm going to get stuck here for like at least 20 minutes.

253
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:16,860
This is the one where you have to gently tap the spring to make it so it almost gets all

254
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:32,340
the way but doesn't go all the way. So how do I do it? Where did it go? Can I get a better view?

255
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:44,760
I want a better view of this. Okay. How to play. Find the green light. That's where you want to

256
00:47:44,760 --> 00:48:08,659
get the green light. Press and hold. Green lights up. I can't see it. Do it again. Yeah, you want

257
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:14,219
it to land on the... Okay, you want to land right there. But I also want to be able to... I want a

258
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:30,789
better view. Get it. Get it. Oh, that's too bad. Do it again. It's all the way up. Oh, shit. Too much.

259
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:44,980
Another hundred tickets. I like this one. Where's the green? Where is it? On the other side. All

260
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:56,840
right. It's like in the middle top right. Oh, whatever. 20 tickets. I'll take it. How much money

261
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:12,460
do I have? All right. Right there. All right. Come on. Ready? No. I have to get it at least once.

262
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:25,510
Right there again. 100. It's fine. I could probably do this noise perfectly.

263
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:46,550
I'm getting a lot of tickets though. It's 2,500 tickets. Damn it. Too hard. Make the noise. I'll

264
00:49:46,550 --> 00:50:04,280
try. I gotta get away from the mic because it's gonna be loud. The first one was perfect.

265
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:26,840
Okay. Come on. I have to get this one time. All right. I refuse to move on until I do this.

266
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:44,969
You understand? You understand? I will call Uncle Phil and have him deposit five grand into my

267
00:50:44,969 --> 00:51:10,599
checking account. That sound is easy to make. You just have to go. Uncle Phil. Look at this shit.

268
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:18,550
It was always so fun to see that. You always got jealous of that motherfucker. When you walked by

269
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,389
and that person was sitting there with their hands on their hips like, oh yeah, well the thing just

270
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:28,889
spit out hundreds of these tickets. Like I primed it. I prepped that fucking thing for you.

271
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:38,329
It takes like 20 minutes and they don't even pick them up. They just let them pile up like this.

272
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:56,090
Guys, it's 2,500 tickets. I have to do that. I have to get the PlayStation 4.

273
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:13,030
Come on. Come on. I just need to do this once. Same spot. A little bit harder.

274
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:22,340
That's the one. No, it's not. I had it. That's the easiest one to get.

275
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:38,199
Find the green light. Right there.

276
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,659
I have to do this.

277
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:33,079
Who cares? I care. I do. It's not close. Imagine going into an arcade and I'm standing there.

278
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:39,460
I'm hogging the machine right now. There are children that want to play this.

279
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:53,619
Children. And I'm like leaning in and like lifting my legs up. Oh, whoa, almost. Can I try?

280
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:07,670
Just turn and look at them. I can get this. I can do this. Excuse me, sir. Can I play?

281
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:23,260
And turn and just fucking yell that over there. I don't even know where it is.

282
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:46,250
What a psycho. Going in. How much money do I have left?

283
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:57,719
I'm kind of like sicko millionaire. Like goes in here with like 500 bucks to.

284
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:01,639
No, I've got to hit the green. I've got to do it. I don't give a shit about this.

285
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:07,800
It's just not even real currency. I don't care. I plan on just walking by and throwing this in the

286
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:30,630
trash. Just a few more. You can afford a Tootsie Roll and an eraser. Yeah, I can get a box of nerds.

287
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:39,820
Don't worry, guys. Only eight grand worth of these gets you the PlayStation 4.

288
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:46,039
I can also get a sticky hand, too. Why have arcade even like Dave and Buster's does this?

289
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:50,679
And I don't know why. Is there some kind of weird racket? Weird, like cornered market with

290
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:57,800
ticket prizes? It's always like fucking sticky hands, Tootsie Rolls, like the finger traps,

291
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:06,230
shitty stuffed animals, and weird alcoholic joke shit that nobody ever uses.

292
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:30,090
I don't want that. What do you mean what? The ones that like the it's the top is

293
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:37,219
look like it looks like an hourglass. It's it's empty at the top empty at the bottom.

294
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:44,469
You flip it. You can take a shot either way. It's real jokey. You guys have never seen that before?

295
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:54,010
What are you talking about? This is the one. That's the one. That's the one. This is the one.

296
00:56:54,889 --> 00:57:11,829
I hate you. I hate you, game. Oh my fucking god. I'm not leaving.

297
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,409
The ground is going to be tickets more than ground. I don't care. How much money do I have?

298
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:38,440
I have a dollar left. Uh oh. How do I call uncle? I have to get it right now. Shit. No. All right.

299
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:55,130
Just hold on. Let me get some more money. Nobody touched those. How do I get more money? I have to

300
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:13,590
go to the money machine, right? Just making sure. Tickets. Tickets. No. No. Where's the

301
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:40,969
where's the money machine? All right. How do I get more money from uh from Dr. Phil? Whatever

302
00:58:40,969 --> 00:59:00,500
his name is. VIP birthday room. Okay. I need to go to the VIP birthday room. I thought this was the

303
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:46,059
VIP birthday room. Watch out. Little Jacob has to go into the money machine, guys. I'm not even

304
00:59:46,059 --> 01:00:00,519
part of the party. Is this all I care about? All right. I took my shower. Is this how like

305
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:36,619
billionaires take showers? Just wet one dollar bills. I gotta turn it up. New song. No. New

306
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:59,929
song. Whoop. I think I just killed someone. What? What happened? It's shining flashly. All right.

307
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:14,309
What else is over here? Is that it? Little goodie bags. Ooh. Cheesy poops. Why did I even buy a

308
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:50,539
drink? I want to do a money shower again. Is this some other kid's birthday party? I think I could

309
01:01:50,539 --> 01:02:00,010
do if these existed I think I would be really good at it. I think I could get almost every single one

310
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:06,539
of these. If I had to take a bet, hey you give me a hundred bucks and you go in there and you try to

311
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:14,550
get as much as you can, I think I could make more than like two or three hundred dollars. Keep that

312
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:20,389
in mind. Keep that in mind. Keep that in mind. I want one of these. I'm gonna get one of those.

313
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:26,599
Keep that in mind. What else is over here? Is this like the actual birthday party?

314
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:40,519
Are these the adults? What's? I don't understand this. Islandville Times. Carnival coming to town.

315
01:02:40,519 --> 01:02:56,250
It is coming to town. You're right. Pinata? What a spoiled little shit. It's not even time to do this

316
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:03,929
and I'm just gonna break it. This is an hour or two from now. That gets hung over there. But I'm

317
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:09,849
gonna break it now. All right. I'm good. Let's go. I got my money. I'm going back to the duck machine.

318
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:43,130
Whatever the hell this thing is. Move. I'm ready. Here we go. First try. I'm sorry. I have to do it.

319
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:51,750
Each one of these has to be completed somehow. This is the best one to do. That's it. That's

320
01:03:51,750 --> 01:04:10,980
the one. It is. Oh my god. You know what's actually kind of funny? I think I have sat there

321
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:20,820
at an arcade doing this machine cursing at this thing. Doing the same. At least it's for free.

322
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:32,469
You know there's like peep. There's like the families and kids around. I want to hear them.

323
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:37,059
So I just like put my hand up to my mouth and pretend I'm sneezing while coughing.

324
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,099
So every time I miss you know you have to be playing it like fucking 60 times.

325
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:56,869
You just go like and like you move your head forward like you sneezed every time.

326
01:04:57,989 --> 01:04:59,670
It's easy. People think you're sneezing or coughing.

327
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:11,460
It would look so obvious.

328
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:23,139
Yeah I know. If somebody sat there for that long. Is there a policy in arcades? Does anybody know?

329
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:30,579
If there's somebody getting anybody work in an arcade. If there's of if somebody getting overly

330
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:35,699
frustrated. Is there a protocol where it's like okay like we should probably what do we do?

331
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:51,340
As long as you don't puke you're fine. All right I'm only I this can't be the whole stream.

332
01:05:51,340 --> 01:06:06,900
So I'm gonna only try this like 30 to 40 more times. I got plenty of money. It's all right.

333
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:30,440
God damn it. This is not gonna be the whole stream. Try to fill the building with tickets.

334
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:50,230
Just he says don't pick up any tickets. Oh god. They're not taking anything. It's fine. I have

335
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:52,869
to accept defeat. I'll accept defeat when I go to zero in my bank account.

336
01:07:10,889 --> 01:07:14,199
I just realized how unhealthy of a thing that was to say.

337
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:17,960
No no guys. I'll stop when I when I go to zero in my bank account.

338
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:41,420
What? That's not what you should be saying. That's not what you should ever say. Somebody just said

339
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:46,619
I'm never gonna hit that green light. I can come back to it. I'll come back to it later.

340
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,019
After I do this like another 10 more times. This is the one right here. Come on. Ready? One

341
01:07:51,019 --> 01:08:10,570
two three. It's the one. Fuck. Not hard enough. I'm doing it way too soft.

342
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:25,350
Is this the whole? It's not going to be the whole stream. I can't even leave.

343
01:08:25,989 --> 01:08:48,279
I can't leave. It won't let me leave. I'm stuck. All right. I'm fine. What's this one? Mega drop.

344
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:52,789
Oh I remember this one. This one's cool. Tickets. They'll be fine.

345
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:08,739
How many balls do I get? Just one? Yeah you the mega jackpot's almost impossible to get here.

346
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:12,819
Say I know that it's impossible.

347
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:29,500
1448. Get in there. What's that? What happened? Add bonus ball. I did it. I could do more.

348
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:38,789
Hit drop bonus. Hit drop bonus balls for rapid fire bonus. Oh you gotta get it in. That thing

349
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:48,250
has a ring around it though so it's impossible. What was that? Mystery bonus?

350
01:09:48,970 --> 01:10:00,380
That's not bad. That's 212 tickets. How come they're not coming out? Let's go straight in.

351
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:13,130
250 tickets. There we go. Do you want me to do it again? I'll do it one more time.

352
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:28,140
Almost in there. 40 tickets. I used to time the ball falling straight into the highest prize

353
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:36,359
one. It takes time but I perfected it as a kid. Yeah you can just time it just to go straight in.

354
01:10:37,159 --> 01:10:42,550
Give me the mystery bonus. What is this? Like roulette wheel bullshit? This is just roulette

355
01:10:42,550 --> 01:11:00,149
wheel for kids. Get in there. Give me the 50. You're still checking to make sure the tickets are on

356
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:13,189
kind of. I want to make sure that they... I want to fill the whole house. The day even busters here

357
01:11:13,189 --> 01:11:18,390
you put an out of order sign on this machine because it was too easy to get constant jackpots

358
01:11:21,239 --> 01:11:25,319
out of order. I thought they want people to win. One more time.

359
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:37,960
Ah it was right there. Get in there. Get in the mystery bonus.

360
01:11:44,329 --> 01:11:57,510
I can't wait to play skeeball. Oh it was right there. I want to just try to get that once.

361
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,949
I'm gonna try timing. We have a new noise to make.

362
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,909
Oh I did it. I actually did it. I actually did it. I did it.

363
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:24,260
Oh there's gonna be more bonuses. What? I thought that was like super bonus. Drop bonus. I thought

364
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:36,819
I just... I thought it doesn't drop. I thought it drops like a bunch of them. Like rapid bonus drop.

365
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:49,500
I needed to mash the button. I was clicking and didn't do anything.

366
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:59,460
Imagine getting the bonus first try and not hitting the button to get the bonus.

367
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:15,029
I thought I was. It just disappeared.

368
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:27,930
I did it again.

369
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:36,899
Wait what? What happened to that one? No I gotta hear the Yoshi sound one more time.

370
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:42,390
There it is. I love it. I love the Yoshi sound. I have to hear it like a few more times.

371
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:57,220
Got it. My brother could kick your ass this game. Tell him bring it on.

372
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:03,829
Well that was like three or four consistent bonus balls in a row.

373
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:08,409
Damn it. All right I'm gonna try to get the jackpot. I'm gonna try to go for it.

374
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:21,859
I'm gonna try to time it. Like right here. Ready? Oh that was close.

375
01:14:22,579 --> 01:14:26,630
It's that like stupid toilet bowl lid that fucks you up.

376
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:45,399
One more time. Get in there. Rapid bonus. Mega bonus. Oh no.

377
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,979
The tickets are not gone. The tickets are still there. I can see them.

378
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:58,279
Oh shit. Get in there anyways.

379
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:12,630
Here we go. Ready?

380
01:15:14,869 --> 01:15:34,329
And try it last time. Get in. The tickets didn't despawn. I have an eagle eye on them.

381
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:37,430
Mega jackpot. Get in there.

382
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:44,390
Oh.

383
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:05,430
And that's the way he went. What? That's not what it looks like.

384
01:16:06,069 --> 01:16:17,619
Are you serious? Why is this like such a tiny pile? Just making sure.

385
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:46,020
Come on. Come on. Let's go. This is the one. Come on.

386
01:16:49,529 --> 01:17:16,520
I got my muscle memories wrong. What happens if it goes in the toilet?

387
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:26,739
There's no skill to this. Well how? What do you mean no skill to this? How have I not hit it?

388
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:44,970
It's forward momentum and spring-loaded action. Don't make me get one of these for the carnival

389
01:17:44,970 --> 01:18:00,899
stream and have you guys prove me wrong. Don't make me rent one of these. Come on. Get it.

390
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:40,180
Can I do it? Oh my god. Damn it. All right. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out.

391
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:43,859
After this last one here. This is the last one and then I'm out until I come back.

392
01:18:55,109 --> 01:19:01,020
I have to do this at least once. My brain is wired so fucked up. You know what I'm saying?

393
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:06,140
I have such a fucked up wiring of my brain. I have to do this even if the stream is off.

394
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:11,100
This stream could not be online and I will sit here until I do it.

395
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:30,680
And now I'm just not even close. Kim will come in here and ask me to open another jar.

396
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:40,199
My hand will be too weak from clicking this mouse. This is it. This is the one right here.

397
01:19:40,760 --> 01:20:08,140
Oh damn it. What a loser is what he just said. What a loser. Oh my god.

398
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,710
I have to win to prove that person wrong.

399
01:20:41,539 --> 01:20:44,579
You can do this with cheering you want. Thanks guys. I need more cheering.

400
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:49,500
This is getting really high. I'm gonna be able to make a ticket snowman.

401
01:20:50,140 --> 01:21:12,039
This is gonna hurt somebody. That's a hazard. I'm only gonna try to get this one spot here.

402
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:20,579
Ready? I'm gonna have to count here. Ready? This is this spot right here. One. Two. Nope.

403
01:21:20,579 --> 01:21:35,020
It's less than two seconds. Yes, I'd like to play again. One. It's a little more than one second.

404
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,739
Less than two seconds. More than what? That doesn't make any mathematical sense.

405
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:41,739
It's more than one second. Less than two seconds. So it's like 1.72.

406
01:21:41,739 --> 01:22:08,199
It's like 1.82. It's fucking hard.

407
01:22:38,699 --> 01:22:45,380
I'm turning into an ape. That was so fucking loud. I'm so sorry.

408
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:54,279
I'm so sorry everybody. That was fucking loud. That was rigged. It is. I did it.

409
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:08,979
My god. It wanted to do it too. All right. I'm gonna do it. I got it. It's gonna happen.

410
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:39,020
Here it is. This is literally a podcast at this point. He hasn't moved from this spot.

411
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:46,500
This would be the shittiest podcast I've ever listened to. Hey everybody. Welcome to the podcast

412
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,779
here. Yeah, hold on. Hey everybody. Welcome back to the podcast. Today's episode is...

413
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:15,399
Almost. Now we're gonna take our mid-podcast break. Please listen to our sponsor. Why would

414
01:24:15,399 --> 01:24:29,659
you download this podcast? Imagine that for like fucking two hours? That's what's happening now.

415
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:36,949
You don't have to imagine because that's what's happening right now. That's what has happened.

416
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:40,710
It has been an hour and 25 minutes. You don't need to imagine or pretend.

417
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:49,000
Okay. This is the one right here. They're not giving it to me anymore because my

418
01:24:49,000 --> 01:25:01,340
cursor's on it. The game developer put in a feature. All right. I'm serious. This is like

419
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:11,699
the last three or four times I'm gonna try this. Okay. I gotta get like three or four more attempts

420
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:24,069
with the green being there. Which one is it? This one? It's this one right here. Oh shit.

421
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:38,819
Fucking psycho. Go cash your tickets in. That's it. I know it. I know that's the one.

422
01:25:39,380 --> 01:26:27,189
Okay. Here it is. One, two. Get out of the way. Come on. Whoa. What just happened?

423
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:47,399
God damn it. Don't let the chicken win. Okay. At this point people have their phones out

424
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:53,430
and this is like watch this guy at the arcade being insane. There's like people,

425
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:59,590
there's like 10 cell phones behind me. Oh my god. I'm gonna freak out.

426
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:14,539
One, two. Oh my god. What do I do? How do I get out of this? I have to like rip the,

427
01:27:14,539 --> 01:27:17,260
I have to rip the ethernet cable out of my computer I think. I have to rip the power out.

428
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:31,050
All right. One more try there and that's it. And then I'm moving on to the next machine.

429
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:48,970
That has to be right there though. Please do this forever. No. Don't enable me.

430
01:27:49,609 --> 01:28:03,619
Get out of here. This is, this is my ticket. All right. Oh fuck. One more. No. That's it.

431
01:28:03,619 --> 01:28:06,420
That's it. I gotta get out of here. I have to leave. That's it. I can't do it.

432
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:17,500
I can't do it. I'm out. I gotta leave. I can't do it. Just rip it out.

433
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:44,359
I can't, I can't do it. But what's, there's no reason to try. I can't do it. I can't move.

434
01:28:54,489 --> 01:29:02,760
You know, this looks like somebody, it looks like you've

435
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:22,300
squashed this and all of its guts came out. What's this one? I love this one. No. In order. In

436
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:30,090
order. In order. I'll be back motherfucker. I'll be back and I'm gonna, I'll take care of that.

437
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:58,949
Don't worry. All right. Let's play skeeball. I did it. I did it. I can leave. I can leave. I did it.

438
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:16,779
What's this? Okay. I went. I went. Okay. I'm out. That's enough. I did it. I knew I had it in me. I

439
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:20,060
could feel it. I could feel it. I just had, I knew it. I, you know something you just know.

440
01:30:23,369 --> 01:30:28,810
I just knew it. I felt like, like a, like a guardian angel landed on my back and was like,

441
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:56,460
Jeremy, you can do that. I was like, okay. Oops. Ooh. This is fun. Cole, RG, thanks for the five

442
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:08,500
community subs, Cole. Thank you for those. I gotta get a hundred. Hundreds. It's so satisfying to do

443
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:44,229
swish it. Oh, come on. What a dick. Swish it. I gotta get a swish. Oh, one swish and then I'm done.

444
01:31:50,649 --> 01:31:56,550
Oh, use the tickets. I will. I will. I'm just making sure that nobody else can touch that machine.

445
01:31:57,579 --> 01:32:05,159
I have it reserved. A hundred. Oh, they're not going to despawn. I got a, I got a good eye on

446
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:16,520
him. Oh, shower please. Okay. Let's get him. You ready for this? You ready to pick up our

447
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:55,380
baklava? This is going to be so satisfying. What? What do you mean stop? Stop. Stop. Stop. Why?

448
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:26,710
What are you talking about? Okay. That's it. Just want to see if I had, if lightning can strike twice.

449
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:36,060
I'm done. All right. Let's go count them. How many tickets do I have? How many tickets do I have?

450
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:53,210
10,000. What do I got? 80, 80, uh, 8,800? All right. What's next? Ski ball. I want to get the,

451
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:57,689
I want to get better ski ball. Let's do the one on the right.

452
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:08,779
8,600, 800, 8,641. How many points do I need to get on ski ball before I move on?

453
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:15,029
I'll determine that in a minute. I gotta find the hundred and just keep it in the same place.

454
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:20,149
That's the strategy. Just don't move the fucking mouse. So I'm going to, let's see.

455
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:27,289
Let's see right here. Maybe like right there. And then we're going to go halfway up. No, not even

456
01:34:27,289 --> 01:34:50,310
close. No, a little bit less than that. I need to get 800 points to leave ski ball. Uh, that's never

457
01:34:50,310 --> 01:35:03,829
going to happen. Why do I keep moving? I'm not moving. It's going, it's doing that automatically.

458
01:35:03,829 --> 01:35:09,420
It picks up the ball. Yeah. Just climb up on the machine and put it in the hundred

459
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:16,630
and then get yelled at and you get told, don't do that again. Oh, okay. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

460
01:35:21,109 --> 01:35:29,159
Yeah. Just walk over there, reach up and drop all the balls in there and then get yelled at

461
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,600
and have your mother get called. Oh my God. I have to get a hundred points. What a pathetic score.

462
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:44,970
90. I can't, come on. I can't even get my IQ in this game. Let's go. I gotta get at least my IQ.

463
01:35:54,699 --> 01:36:08,659
Come on. You can't get zero points. See that you, you are on top. You got that one. You're on top

464
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:25,539
of that. Why is it so hard to get the hundred? There it is. All right. Right there. I know where

465
01:36:25,539 --> 01:36:37,000
it is. Just don't move from this spot. Ready? Shit. All right. I'm, I'm, I'm almost at my IQ.

466
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:51,239
So I passed it by just a little bit. All right. I got the hundred. That's all I care about.

467
01:36:52,520 --> 01:37:02,010
Is there one more? All right. 180. No, I'm done. All right. Let's go and get these up. 180 tickets.

468
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:08,699
All right. So that leaves us with the ones in the middle and then there's, I think there's another

469
01:37:08,699 --> 01:37:20,859
floor. Yeah. I know there's like another floor, but I remember this one. You have to speed drop

470
01:37:20,859 --> 01:37:25,420
this. All right. Let's try it. You got to try to get all 50, right? Press the button to drop

471
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:30,810
balls into the buckets. You got to try to go like, yeah, you have to like spam it and get it in.

472
01:37:31,369 --> 01:37:46,220
So like this, you got to try to get five in each one. If I remember to get them all.

473
01:37:47,020 --> 01:38:04,359
I can do all 50. I can do all 50 guys. Just relax. You got to go one, two, three, four, five,

474
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:31,220
one, two, three, four, five. Ready? What? What? What? Why? Why? Why? It delayed. It was lagged.

475
01:38:31,220 --> 01:39:06,149
What the fuck was that? Pull back that button. Listen to the clicks. He wins another one.

476
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:15,539
Another 500 tickets. Another one. Thanks guys. You want to see me do it again?

477
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,180
Yeah. Do it again. Do it again. Yeah. All right. I guess I'll do it again.

478
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:47,750
Nobody was watching. That one didn't count. Okay. Here we go. I can do this twice. Ready?

479
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:14,550
Oh man. That's an easy. I'll do it. I got it rigged. I will get. Thank you. I'll do it again.

480
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,750
I'm going to get like 5,000 tickets one more time. I got to get three, three times.

481
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:49,989
It's a drum. An easy 1500 tickets. Shit. It's okay. Sorry. Cash out. Cash out. No, no. I'm fine.

482
01:40:50,710 --> 01:41:05,000
All right. Let me get it one more time. Let me try it one more time. Ready? No, I didn't mean to

483
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,479
click. I clicked accidentally. My fucking death adder. All right. I'm done. I'm going to go to

484
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:17,369
the next one. I won it twice. That's all that matters. This person's even wearing AirPods.

485
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:40,699
She can't even hear me. Right? I'm fine. All right. Here we go. This one will. I had to do

486
01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:49,619
this one last down here because this one's going to fuck me up so bad. I have beaten this in real

487
01:41:49,619 --> 01:42:23,460
life before. I've gotten the last prize before. I have done it. You remember this one? Minor prize.

488
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:38,819
Go for the major. Oh, fuck. It doesn't, it doesn't every, it does that every time. It doesn't,

489
01:42:38,819 --> 01:42:44,180
it does it on purpose. It does it on purpose. It does it on purpose. It pushes it forward.

490
01:42:44,819 --> 01:43:28,520
I'm rushing. I thought I had it first try. Come on. No, major. Give it to me. You fucking piece

491
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:57,739
of shit. Major. And I fucking just, my hands are greased. I had to dump my hand in oil before I

492
01:43:57,739 --> 01:44:40,039
played this one. All right. Fuck. I have to win this. It's, I'm locked in now. No minor prizes

493
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:51,859
for me. I got to get the last one. Sorry. Fucked it up. I'm like too, that's too much pressure.

494
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:20,010
I wish I had the button in front of me. You know, the big like, what? What? That was correct.

495
01:45:20,729 --> 01:45:30,460
That was correct. That was correct. And something you need to know about this game

496
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:36,699
in real life. I don't know how it is tuned in this one, but you can actually inside of this machine,

497
01:45:37,579 --> 01:45:43,899
you can tweak to make sure that even if it's done correctly, the person doesn't win at all.

498
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:47,979
It just skips. So I don't, it could, this one could also be rigged. I don't know.

499
01:45:51,829 --> 01:46:44,340
I thought I had it that first try too. Holy shit. Relax. Okay. I did it. Oh, I got headphones.

500
01:46:54,619 --> 01:46:59,899
No, what that was, that was, that was all, that was a wound of a bunch of tension that just had

501
01:46:59,899 --> 01:47:06,149
to come up. That was just a bunch of like neuroticism that had to release from my body.

502
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:22,180
Oh, nice. Wait, what? Can I put them on? That was a feel good ink laugh.

503
01:47:31,909 --> 01:47:39,659
10,000 tickets. I win. I beat all the games. I did them all. I beat this one. I got the 500

504
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:43,180
tickets on this one. I got the 500, a hundred tickets on this one. I beat the chicken.

505
01:47:43,739 --> 01:47:56,279
I got the jackpot on this. I got a hundred. I didn't beat this one. What are you gonna get?

506
01:47:56,279 --> 01:48:02,819
You gonna get hockey? You gonna spell hockey? I did beat the chicken. I got the green light.

507
01:48:03,539 --> 01:48:20,550
I said where's the 500? I got 500. Let me try to spell hockey.

508
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:31,909
I blew it. That was 500 right there though. All right. How many chances do I get?

509
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:40,699
I never got the mega jackpot on the draw point. Yeah, but I got the regular. I got the jackpot.

510
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:55,500
This is gonna be hard to do. Shit. How many times you get to do it once? Three times? Four times?

511
01:48:56,460 --> 01:49:21,859
Hello. Hi, guys. Well, that was weird. Strangely enough, the internet just cut to zero.

512
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:27,300
I don't know what happened. I don't know why. It was pretty perfect the whole time.

513
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:34,229
So that's really fucking irritating. But hey, we're back. Welcome everybody. How you doing?

514
01:49:38,789 --> 01:49:49,899
Let's see if it happens again. Probably not though. Who knows? So sorry about that. Let's

515
01:49:49,899 --> 01:50:00,539
try this again. Hey, we're back. How are you? Uh, Pinman. Thank you Pinman for the 10 community

516
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:07,020
subs. Appreciate it. 10 community subs from Pinman. I'm gonna make the- I'm gonna re- I'm

517
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:10,380
just gonna tweet again just because people probably thought that might have been it.

518
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:24,710
But it's not. Can I- can you retweet your own tweet? What happens if you do that? Is that- is

519
01:50:24,710 --> 01:50:30,810
that- can you do that? No, no, no, no. That's stupid. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna redo

520
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:51,109
the tweet. Did anybody see my tweet? I'm gonna redo it again. Retweeting your own tweet and then

521
01:50:51,109 --> 01:51:04,630
quoting that tweet in another retweet. I'll just do this. Damn it. I was- we were writing- we were

522
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:08,949
in the groove too. That's- that's so unfortunate. All right. Don't let it bother you. Don't let it

523
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:20,170
just- didn't happen. Didn't happen. Didn't even happen. Let's go. It bothered me. It bothered me

524
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:36,550
too. Let me spell hockey. But thank you for your patience everybody. It's 10. I don't think it's

525
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:53,640
even possible to do this. You gotta get them lined up together. H- okay. H-K-E. It carries over.

526
01:51:54,439 --> 01:52:03,399
Oh shit. Okay. So I need the O, the C, and the Y. Okay, let's try to get the O, the C, and the Y.

527
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:10,119
Bingo. Oh, that was- that- that was just right off the grid. That's perfect.

528
01:52:13,100 --> 01:52:19,880
C. All right, just need the O. What's the jackpot? That- that would be the jackpot, wouldn't it?

529
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:32,020
Where's the O? There it is. Damn it. I blew it. It's all right. Come on. Wrap around again.

530
01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:44,630
2,000 tickets! Are you fucking kidding me? That's like the biggest jackpot so far.

531
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:56,390
I almost just did an evil laugh. Let's get these counted. I did it all. I- I- okay, now we have to

532
01:52:56,390 --> 01:53:05,850
move on to the next set of games. I got the fidget spinner. I got the- the hockey jackpot.

533
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:10,649
I didn't get the jackpot on this, but this thing's stupid, so I refuse. I don't know

534
01:53:10,649 --> 01:53:17,640
what the jackpot is on this, but I don't know. I refuse. I got the cards here. Let's count these.

535
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:25,670
I'm not gonna cash in yet. You only got one of the three fidget spinners.

536
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:35,079
I'm not gonna get all three fidget spinners. All right. This is my birthday party. Should I

537
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:47,579
spend them? Ticket redemption kiosk. I have 13,000. Do I get to hold on to these? All right,

538
01:53:47,579 --> 01:53:56,489
let's see what I get. All right. Glow stick is 250 tickets. I'll take a glow stick.

539
01:53:58,069 --> 01:54:05,050
Okay, cool. What else do you got? A stuffed coin? Dumb. Nobody wants that. Paddle ball? No.

540
01:54:05,050 --> 01:54:13,380
It looks- that'll go into the trash. Basketball? No. Fuzzy dice? No. 2,500 foam hand. Stuff ticket?

541
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:23,859
No. Stuff donut? No. That's ta- how many do I have? 13,000? 25,000. What's the most expensive

542
01:54:23,859 --> 01:54:38,310
thing here? A mirror? A slingshot? Does it work? Can I actually use it? Piggy bank. Headphones. I

543
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:46,789
already got the headphones out of that thing, so I don't need these. Salt rock lamp? Yep.

544
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:59,319
Those things are so cool. 100,000 tickets is for the boom box. 50,000 for teddy bear. All right.

545
01:55:01,899 --> 01:55:08,819
He just lifts his hands up over the counter and lets it go. All right. I'm gonna save my tickets.

546
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:13,850
I got what I want. I got a glow stick and I got a salt lamp. How much is the PlayStation 4?

547
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:23,640
It's not on here, unfortunately. Can't save indoors. How do I get my card out of there? All

548
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:39,000
right. I'm giving my stuff. Okay. Let's go to the next part. I've completed all these ones.

549
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:48,550
So how do I go- how do I get to the next area? With games. I know there's more games. Go to my

550
01:55:48,550 --> 01:56:10,310
golf cart. Jerry's the pier. The beach. Is it the pier? Oh man. There's like rides too? Are you

551
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:18,699
serious? How much does it cost? Your wallet balance. So I can do eight pack ride pass.

552
01:56:18,699 --> 01:56:25,909
Let's get the mega pass. Wait. I can only afford this. Okay. There's the eight pack for the ride.

553
01:56:25,909 --> 01:56:39,050
Okay. Eight ride pass. Should I bring more money in here? I'm getting- I gotta get more money from

554
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:50,699
the uncle. Hold on. Yeah. Back to- hold on. Back to Larry's. I need to go back in my money shower.

555
01:56:57,109 --> 01:57:07,189
Go rob your uncle. No. My uncle just stashes one dollar bills in here for me to take whenever I

556
01:57:07,189 --> 01:57:16,140
want. And give me some of this too. Just do the money shower for 10 minutes. I'll get 200 bucks.

557
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:28,329
We'll do this until I get 200 and then we can just- we can go do the rest of it. Just stay in one

558
01:57:28,329 --> 01:57:32,329
spot. Is one of the tricks for this thing? People freak out and they try to grab all over the place.

559
01:57:32,409 --> 01:57:38,649
No. Just keep your hand here and just grab. Grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab, grab,

560
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:40,890
you'll get as many. You don't have to freak out. People freak out in here.

561
01:57:45,739 --> 01:57:52,439
And make sure you put them in your pockets or in your underwear. You know, people are like,

562
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:56,359
oh my hands are so full. I don't have any more room in my hands. Just stuff them down your pants.

563
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:20,020
Like stuff into your underwear. Keep grabbing. Okay. That was weird. Because it's hard to do

564
01:58:20,020 --> 01:58:24,260
your pant- your pockets. You might be panicking and it's hard to get your hand in your pockets if

565
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:31,060
you're stuffing bills in there, but your underwear is just a gigantic elastic pocket.

566
01:58:34,359 --> 01:58:39,319
I would just be grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff, grab, stuff. I would take them

567
01:58:39,319 --> 01:58:48,390
all. Once you have 10 bills in your pocket, it's going to be hard to put anything else in there.

568
01:58:48,949 --> 01:59:09,770
One more time. Tuck your shirt in your pants and then your shirt isn't bagged. Yeah. And then just

569
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:14,970
start feeding it down. First put like rubber bands around the bottom of your pant legs

570
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:31,210
and then just become an inflated guy. All right. I got 200 bucks. 199. That's fine.

571
01:59:32,409 --> 01:59:48,039
I'll take it. Get out. That was like very clear. Get out of my way. All right. Let's go to,

572
01:59:48,840 --> 02:00:05,640
is there a, uh, how did I get to that before? I have to be outside. I was just thinking about

573
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:11,239
doing the chicken game again and I freaked out and stopped. All right. Um, let's go to,

574
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:33,029
let's go to Barry's. Let me sell my stuff. You know, I had to try, right? Barry's. All right.

575
02:00:36,569 --> 02:00:43,979
Please use the other door. No, I'm using this one. Pawn and swap. Barry, we buy anything.

576
02:00:44,539 --> 02:00:55,479
What's my hand? Oh, my card. Cheesy poops. I thought they were poops. Okay. My uncle gives

577
02:00:55,479 --> 02:01:12,859
me these for free. Why would I buy them? That's enough of that. Uh, what's this? Okay. So, uh,

578
02:01:12,859 --> 02:01:25,659
let's go here. We have to put in the headphones. How much are the headphones worth?

579
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:46,069
I thought that said 4,500. All right. What about the salt rock thing? I don't think I want this.

580
02:01:54,199 --> 02:02:03,720
Yeah. I don't want like the zip. Yeah. I did say it was cool, but that's whatever.

581
02:02:05,619 --> 02:02:18,539
Keeping the glow stick. All right. Let's go to the pier. I'm ready. I got my pass. Let me get,

582
02:02:18,539 --> 02:02:26,260
I need to get me get another pass. The super pass. I have like 40 rides. I have like 30 something

583
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:39,979
rides. All right. Let's dart over here. 20 coins for $5. That's one of these machines. I hate these

584
02:02:39,979 --> 02:02:59,210
things. Ah, hold on. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Shit. I hate these ones because

585
02:02:59,210 --> 02:03:16,810
it's travel time. What is it? What do those chips do? Can I hit the machine? I probably can,

586
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:20,250
but it's going to get me in trouble. I gotta wait. I gotta time it. I'm going to do this way.

587
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:26,180
No. Damn it. Hit it. I'm not going to hit the machine. That's again, that's illegal.

588
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:36,819
That's against the law. No, I'm not going to do something against the law.

589
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:43,909
We're going to win this the right way. This isn't even working.

590
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:57,050
This doesn't even do anything. I'm trying to get it like, what am I doing? Why am I trying to do it

591
02:03:57,050 --> 02:04:03,340
like that? I don't know why I'm trying to get it to land on top of that. It makes no sense.

592
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:15,939
Pick a prize. Hammer. Four prize credits. I don't have any prize credits. All right. Let's see this

593
02:04:15,939 --> 02:04:23,750
again. I can do this. What's over there? Look at how empty that one is. All right. We're going to go

594
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:42,250
now. Ooh, dropping more prize tokens. Why is this not moving? Are these just glued on here

595
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:57,939
under the coins dropping down a hole? Wait, why? Why can I, why would I be allowed to do this?

596
02:04:58,819 --> 02:05:17,800
This seems like cheating. Tokens have no real value. These machines are not regulated in any

597
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:26,100
way and are most likely a scam. Do it again. I'm just going to put all the coins up at the same

598
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:34,680
time and try to just knock something up. He loses even when he's cheating. Watch this. I'm going to

599
02:05:35,399 --> 02:05:43,720
strategically place these coins in the corner here and there's going to be a big push. I wish

600
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:52,069
they would not stack on top of each other. Why are they doing this? Why are you doing this? Stop

601
02:05:52,069 --> 02:06:01,659
doing that. Why? That doesn't make any, all right. I've got magnets. They magnetized. I get it now.

602
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:24,329
Do it. What? That doesn't make any sense. I don't believe that for a second.

603
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:35,460
Those prize coins don't do anything. They don't move. I'm going to do this one more time.

604
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:58,439
You can't even get them. Oh, I can get the three down here. All right. These ones are actually

605
02:06:58,439 --> 02:07:03,239
not glued. The right side is the one to do. Look at how stuffed that is too.

606
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:31,579
This is depressing. This is not real money. This is not even real. Yeah, we've got floating coins

607
02:07:31,579 --> 02:07:44,539
over here. It's bullshit. All right. I'm going to at least get the hammer. Let's see what I do

608
02:07:44,539 --> 02:07:53,779
here. Ready? Watch this. That was not, that was unfair. All right. Push forward. Watch this. This

609
02:07:53,779 --> 02:08:09,130
three is going to come out here. That felt really good. Only four at a time. That's all you need to

610
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:27,800
do. All right. I got three game points. How many do I need? Five. I think that's all I need. I

611
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:41,130
might as well get the lighter. How many more points? How many more points? They're right.

612
02:08:41,130 --> 02:09:01,000
They're all right here. I got to try. All right. All right. How many do I have? It's one for the

613
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:12,119
crayon. I'm going to get the, yeah, give me this. I don't know. What? Where'd it go? Where is it?

614
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:42,970
Where's my prize? Where's the prize? Did I just get scammed? Oh, did you just like throw it over

615
02:09:42,970 --> 02:09:48,439
here? I didn't know it went over here. All right. I did it. I won. This one's out of order, out of

616
02:09:48,439 --> 02:10:01,350
order. No, we beat that one. I got the fish. That's all I care about. What's this? Island time customer

617
02:10:01,350 --> 02:10:10,630
service out of order. Oh well. I'm doing, I'm doing the thing that your dog does when they go in the

618
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:16,420
backyard. Just run around the perimeter like three times and then come back in the house.

619
02:10:18,619 --> 02:10:30,680
I need to check the perimeter. Beer tent. I got like a flashlight. Am I allowed in here?

620
02:10:31,779 --> 02:10:40,760
Oh, come on. Am I not 21? Coins on the ground. Some kid will be happy that he finds that.

621
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:51,939
Bumper cars. Ferris wheel. Hold on. All right. Let's do the Ferris wheel.

622
02:10:54,699 --> 02:11:15,029
Holy, why am I running so fast? I made it. Okay. So is this a stranger? Hi. I'm just gonna say the

623
02:11:15,029 --> 02:11:26,579
Ferris wheel is probably the worst ride that's ever been invented. You just sit. You don't do

624
02:11:26,579 --> 02:11:34,310
anything else. I mean, yeah, that's cool. Nice. But you can just look out the window for an airplane.

625
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:41,500
And like, y'all look, I can see the ocean and other stuff there. This shit's like 40 bucks to

626
02:11:41,500 --> 02:12:01,750
do this. Can I stand up? It just skips it. God damn it. Well, that was fucking like seven dollars. Oh,

627
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:09,899
well. Just get on the airplane that everybody has. Yeah, just get on your airplane.

628
02:12:10,619 --> 02:12:16,859
Okay. So what's over here? Look at all these. There's a bunch of other games over there. All

629
02:12:16,859 --> 02:12:24,979
right. Hold on. I'm getting overwhelmed. I don't think it's supposed to be on. Somebody get their

630
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:44,010
kid. Shut it down. We've been a kid. How do I? I want to do this. No, sorry. I'm just looking for

631
02:12:44,010 --> 02:13:08,699
my kid. Jerry. Jerry. Oh, here we go. I would like to play, please. All right. Bumper cars.

632
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:36,949
Peel out. This is so dumb. Is there anything else I can do while I'm in here? Or no, I'm gonna try

633
02:13:36,949 --> 02:13:45,399
to get only go from corner to corner. I'm gonna try to pick up some speed and just ram into

634
02:13:45,399 --> 02:13:50,520
somebody. This is what I used to do. You guys want to have a secret tip for how to do bumper cars

635
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:56,439
right? Drive around in a circle because everyone gets stuck in the middle. Build up enough momentum

636
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:03,239
going around the circle and then bang, you just smash into somebody. Otherwise you just do this.

637
02:14:04,119 --> 02:14:16,539
For five straight minutes. Everybody sticks in the middle. That's the butt. This rat right here.

638
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:42,180
Well, it's not, there's usually not that many people. I'm very all right. All right. Well,

639
02:14:42,180 --> 02:15:00,010
bye. Lemonade. Oh, they have the tower of terror. Okay. Hold on. Which way do I go? Over here. Wait,

640
02:15:00,010 --> 02:15:10,859
wait, wait. Now wait for me. Wait for me. Come on. I'm going to get off for free. This is the

641
02:15:10,859 --> 02:15:16,619
quickest way to get like your head, like your neck broken. Wait for me. Wait for me.

642
02:15:17,579 --> 02:15:39,750
All right. I'll get on it. Oh, it's a security guard. How am I going to get on this?

643
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:56,229
Oh, I think it resets it. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Uh, I do not like riding these.

644
02:15:56,789 --> 02:16:05,779
I don't want to be on this because people puke on these all the time. And if Guy and Sombrero

645
02:16:05,779 --> 02:16:12,260
ahead of you here pukes, this is going to hit you. This is going to be, you're going to,

646
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:17,859
it's going to cover your whole body. It's going to spray you across your entire body, head to toe.

647
02:16:19,909 --> 02:16:34,569
Don't ride these. If you're going to puke on one of these, lean down and like try to puke this way,

648
02:16:34,569 --> 02:16:44,420
but it might get just caught up and swing up in the wind and hit somebody. I hate this. I'm

649
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:53,059
getting off. Or just lift your shirt up. Guys, if you're going to throw up on a ride, don't be the

650
02:16:53,059 --> 02:16:57,379
dick. Like you're throwing up, right? So try to do just, you're going to, your day is going to be

651
02:16:57,379 --> 02:17:03,299
fucked up after that. Anyways, grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it. So it makes a big cup and

652
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:15,139
just puke into your shirt down. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Just, yeah, just

653
02:17:16,579 --> 02:17:22,120
underwear. All right. Sucks. Who wants to ride that? Let's keep going.

654
02:17:29,159 --> 02:17:34,329
I'll do this one. Isn't this now the guardians of the galaxy ride now?

655
02:17:40,059 --> 02:17:45,819
Imagine seeing somebody go, Oh no. They're like pulling their pants and just puking down.

656
02:17:50,469 --> 02:17:54,889
That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. I would never get over it.

657
02:17:57,540 --> 02:18:02,870
Ever. That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.

658
02:18:15,909 --> 02:18:19,590
Okay. I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this. I've never seen this, but I'm

659
02:18:19,590 --> 02:18:31,319
laughing because of it. This didn't happen. People puke on this thing all the time too.

660
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:50,340
That's why the vents are here. Can I stand on it? I can't like stand in it.

661
02:18:55,750 --> 02:19:01,989
I'm not sure I can get a free ride here guys. Maybe I can. Let's see what happens.

662
02:19:03,670 --> 02:19:19,430
Nope. All right. Another game coming up. Wait, here's another ride that you should never ride

663
02:19:19,989 --> 02:19:24,299
because all this ride does is make you feel like you're peeing into your stomach.

664
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:45,639
It doesn't do anything else. No, no, I'm done. I can't. I hate this thing. You could put me on

665
02:19:45,639 --> 02:19:53,829
a roller coaster that goes 5,000 miles per hour. I'll ride it every time. Sorry. I don't want to

666
02:19:53,829 --> 02:19:57,829
ride the thing that specifically just makes you feel like shit. That's all these rides do.

667
02:19:59,350 --> 02:20:06,059
There's no other purpose for these rides. They don't do anything. The only thing they're here

668
02:20:06,059 --> 02:20:14,780
for is to cause you stomach discomfort. And for one thing, I, I tried to do the, but I couldn't

669
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:28,299
get them out. I couldn't get it out. I tried. So he's just standing there. You never should ride

670
02:20:28,299 --> 02:20:31,500
these rides. And I'll tell you another thing. And the thing just hits him right in the face.

671
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:45,479
That's not funny. All right. What's that? There's a couple of games, right? Here we go. One race

672
02:20:45,479 --> 02:20:49,719
is fun. Ooh, this is the, you spray the, I can do this really well. You're going to spray the

673
02:20:49,799 --> 02:21:22,010
circle. Is that me up there? Why am I going so slow? All right. Let me tell you something.

674
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:27,459
Number four clearly did not hit the circle one time. Look at number four. Watch number four.

675
02:21:28,950 --> 02:22:06,629
No, do it again. Let's go. I'm going to put my DPI down for this. Way down. Did I do it? Three?

676
02:22:06,629 --> 02:22:22,420
What? All right. I'm going to put DPI down even more. Try this one more time.

677
02:22:22,420 --> 02:23:05,190
No, it's too, my sensitivity is too high. How do I turn my sensitivity down with my mouse? Hello?

678
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:21,500
Oh my God. My, the DPI is so high. I cannot even use my mouse on my desktop. Did I break it?

679
02:23:25,299 --> 02:23:51,100
Uh, I think I broke it. Yeah. I can't get out of here. Shit. No, I was, I have to win. No,

680
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:58,020
it's not. I'm doing the DPI. I think I just broke it. I mean, I can alt tab, but I'm going to have

681
02:23:58,579 --> 02:24:20,360
to, let's go back in. I can beat that. I just need to turn my mouse sensitivity way down because

682
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:24,280
there's no mouse settings in the game. So let me turn them. Let me turn my mouse like pointer speed

683
02:24:25,319 --> 02:24:34,040
down to like tiny, tiny, tiny amount. Pointer speed. Let's go like down here. That looks good.

684
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:38,969
I think I just crashed my whole computer by changing my mouse speed.

685
02:24:43,959 --> 02:25:06,579
How the fuck does that make any sense? All right. We're good. All right. Here we go. Survival. I

686
02:25:06,579 --> 02:25:31,700
can't do survival. It's not ready yet. There's fireworks in this game. All right. Let me get

687
02:25:31,700 --> 02:25:43,079
some money. I don't care about any of that. Just give me money. Why is it so loud now?

688
02:25:43,799 --> 02:25:58,579
So much louder than it was. Why can I not change the audio now?

689
02:26:04,739 --> 02:26:10,020
Load game. Um, well here's the thing. I never saved it because you can't save inside.

690
02:26:14,709 --> 02:26:38,680
All right. I got plenty of money. Let's go. Uh, one more time. Generate. I don't think I even

691
02:26:38,680 --> 02:27:02,659
need to click. All right. Back to the carnival. Just do the crane game. No, no, no. Everyone's

692
02:27:02,659 --> 02:27:07,540
saying that. Oh no, I didn't save. That's all right. Because I can do the bucket machine

693
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:14,329
or the hockey machine and get 2,500 tickets guaranteed every time. Everything's gonna be

694
02:27:14,329 --> 02:27:36,600
fine. All right. Back to the carnival. Hello, sir. I'd like to buy, uh, eight ride passes

695
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:40,680
because the rides, I don't want to ride rides. I want to play games. And there's like 10 that

696
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:52,739
I haven't played yet. So let's keep going. Back to the water spray. Is lemonade a game or no? Is

697
02:27:52,739 --> 02:28:02,409
it just a lemonade? I think it's just a lemonade. 450. Are you out of your mind? What did he say?

698
02:28:03,049 --> 02:28:26,569
Where's my lemonade? Oh, now the volume is too low. Why? I think I broke something.

699
02:28:26,809 --> 02:28:36,229
Um, when they're strong. All right. I weirdly drank that out of the cup. All right. Here we go.

700
02:28:37,260 --> 02:29:11,219
DPI is better. Time to win. I have to win every single game or riot. The DPI that I didn't do

701
02:29:11,219 --> 02:29:17,959
anything. I changed. I lowered the mouse DPI and lowered the mouse pointer speed. It didn't

702
02:29:17,959 --> 02:30:01,059
matter. I have to do it without it. Let's go. Oh, to relax. I got it. I'm going to have to do this

703
02:30:01,059 --> 02:30:07,559
with my feet in a minute. I think I'm going to do this with my feet. No, I'm not kidding. Start

704
02:30:07,559 --> 02:30:58,600
over here. It's still, I can't. I can. I'm trying to find, where's like the sweets back? Why is it

705
02:30:58,600 --> 02:31:33,750
freezing up? See what I'm saying? Like why does it keep freezing? Take three as a spot. I don't think

706
02:31:33,750 --> 02:31:42,540
I can do, there's nobody at three. I was trying to, I have to be at five. I'm going to try to aim

707
02:31:42,540 --> 02:32:13,079
a little bit, a little bit more down. I did it. I did it. I just did it. I win. Holy shit. All

708
02:32:13,079 --> 02:32:25,719
right. What do I want? Ice cream cone. I want the ice cream cone. Two of those. All right. That one's

709
02:32:25,719 --> 02:32:33,100
done. Congratulations. You win. I wish I could eat those in real life. All right. What's this?

710
02:32:36,010 --> 02:32:44,120
Lucky duck. What's it called? Lucky duck. I don't have to jump to see this. One duck for two bucks.

711
02:32:48,059 --> 02:33:01,159
I don't understand. What does that mean? Oh, you just pick the ducks and one of them is correct.

712
02:33:01,799 --> 02:33:21,639
It's this stupid thing. You can't win this one. There's no way to win this.

713
02:33:23,239 --> 02:33:47,000
What are you? Three? Plus three credits I think is winning. Get pushing. What's pushing? The snake or

714
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:56,969
the cat thing? All right. Hold on. I will. I will. I'll do it. I'll do it. I need to get a plus three.

715
02:33:57,610 --> 02:34:16,250
I did it. I win. Gotta win every single fucking game. Is it a bowling ball? That thing is huge.

716
02:34:16,889 --> 02:34:30,299
Wow. That thing. That's the snake. That's the snake from the children's book. All right. Well,

717
02:34:30,299 --> 02:34:42,809
here's this one. This one's really hard. Five balls for five dollars. You got it. Yellow is three.

718
02:34:42,809 --> 02:35:12,780
Blue is two. How do I throw it harder than that? This is pathetic. I can get it in the middle. I

719
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:18,520
can get it in the middle. Let's do it again. Right in the middle. I can get it right in the lily pad

720
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:35,180
in the middle. Come on. What do you mean? No, you can't. Shit. I don't know why my brain is so

721
02:35:35,180 --> 02:35:47,319
stupid. I thought that just said literally pad toss. I did it. Yes, I did it. Why was that only two?

722
02:35:57,079 --> 02:36:09,000
That was on a blue. I wonder what's the middle word then? There we go. Right there. Done. Ah,

723
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:24,629
shit. This is just the chicken game again. I have to get it in one particular. It's that easy. It's

724
02:36:24,629 --> 02:36:28,709
so easy when you do that. You hit the jackpot. I'm going to hit it twice. Three, two, one, two

725
02:36:28,709 --> 02:36:45,159
times. Did I even get any credits? What did that even do? Give me the goldfish and the hot dog.

726
02:36:45,159 --> 02:36:57,510
I win. Did I get a secret? Am I being watched? Does this guy think I'm cheating or something

727
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:10,180
of my counting cards? Shoot. Oh, that. I am excited for the one over there. I don't care

728
02:37:10,180 --> 02:37:18,469
about anything else. Hundred shots for five dollars. Let's go. I'm really good at this.

729
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:55,639
It's it's I win. I did it. It's over. I won the whole thing. Give me, give me whatever

730
02:37:55,639 --> 02:38:21,430
the credits you're going to give me. Perfect. Oh, I everyone wants you to get the banana. I'll get

731
02:38:21,430 --> 02:38:49,590
the banana. Perfect again. That's how you get it done. Louder, louder. You turn your volume down.

732
02:39:07,559 --> 02:39:16,389
Sorry, sorry. I still fine. Banana. No! Okay, I thought it was about to fall backwards.

733
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:28,069
No, that was easier than I thought it was going to be. Balloon time. Darts, right? This is the dark

734
02:39:28,069 --> 02:39:34,659
game. Oh, there's that ball roller. Oh, there's so many games. I can't wait. All right, let's go.

735
02:39:42,069 --> 02:40:10,889
What's worth what? Okay, I got three darts. Shit. What? Is it painted on there? One credit. Let's

736
02:40:10,889 --> 02:40:36,489
get a skill shot over here. Are they all worth the same? Are they? We're getting all kinds of ideas

737
02:40:36,489 --> 02:40:51,100
for the carnival stream. You guys might get to do this. I think they all just worth one. I'm going

738
02:40:51,100 --> 02:40:57,959
to try to get like one of the cool ones up there. That was worth a shot. Throw it at the guy. I'll

739
02:40:57,959 --> 02:41:17,620
take the hammer. Throw it straight up so it lands on your head. I can't. I can't. That went through

740
02:41:17,620 --> 02:41:34,040
that guy. I won. All right, over here. This is the roll the ball one. Carnival stream. Oh, for those

741
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:41,940
of you that don't know, at some point over the next couple of months, I'm working with a robotics

742
02:41:41,940 --> 02:41:48,760
team and a certain producer that is going to help make a twitch robot controlled carnival.

743
02:41:52,340 --> 02:42:05,510
That's like the next big stream. It should be a lot of fun. So I need to roll this and I'm not

744
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:09,670
trying to... I don't want to give that many details because I don't want to obviously talk about it

745
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:13,350
and say, hey, this is what's going to happen. How cool is this? We're going to be here for like an

746
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:32,729
hour. You just got to get it over the hump, right? Does it have to touch the thing in the back?

747
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:39,639
You can go ahead and admit that there's going to be a dunk tank with you dressed as a clown.

748
02:42:39,639 --> 02:42:45,719
Yeah, but I've already said that. You guys already know that. I've been talking about that for

749
02:42:45,719 --> 02:43:06,040
months. Get in there. Shit. How much is this? Do we have to pay? No. You do not. Touch it? No.

750
02:43:06,040 --> 02:43:09,319
I never understood this game. Do you just have to get it to sit in that little well?

751
02:43:13,620 --> 02:43:22,250
Or does it have to touch the button? He will play this game all the time and I just like don't get

752
02:43:22,250 --> 02:43:34,299
it. Is it going to be a random audience member chosen? No. Well, there's still a lot of ideas on

753
02:43:34,299 --> 02:43:38,139
the table, but the theory is that it's going to be like Twitch control, like Twitch plays.

754
02:43:40,020 --> 02:43:44,020
So you guys are all going to be fighting with each other to try to shoot a pitching machine

755
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:52,629
controlled robot at the dunk tank. That's as hard as I can throw it. That was as hard as I could and

756
02:43:52,629 --> 02:44:21,780
it didn't do it. And we're not, no more, we're not going to talk about it anymore. Just know that

757
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:44,299
it's high. Does it matter how like where I'm looking? Just shoot it with the gun. I still

758
02:44:44,299 --> 02:45:03,299
don't understand. I don't understand how, where are the rules? I don't, I did it. I just did it.

759
02:45:03,299 --> 02:45:18,700
I did it. I win. I did it. They clap for me. Now I demand it. This is my stream. When I say clap

760
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:28,170
for me, God damn it. That means you do like that. I don't think you can hit the button. I'm holding

761
02:45:28,170 --> 02:45:35,219
it as long as I possibly can. No, you don't hit the button. You just get one credit. I'm going to

762
02:45:35,219 --> 02:45:58,969
hammer. That's a golden hammer. What else we got? Oh, basketball shot. My turn. You got to hit all

763
02:45:58,969 --> 02:46:12,459
three of them. I'm actually pretty good at this when I do this in, in real life. I just jump so

764
02:46:12,459 --> 02:46:32,889
high and throw it really high in the air. Okay, hold on. I can do this. Where is he aiming this?

765
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:50,280
I feel like he's not aiming in the right spot. Well, that was pathetic. If you do that at the

766
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:58,100
carnival, oh, you better not be around a bunch of friends. You can't even make it halfway up. Come

767
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:24,870
on. You can do that. I got it. Okay. I got to get three in a row though. What the hell was that?

768
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:47,559
No, I got to do more. I got to do three in a row. At least two in a row. Shit. Come on. I can do

769
02:47:47,559 --> 02:48:01,190
three in a row. That's just two. I can do three. Let's do three in a row. I promise it'll happen.

770
02:48:01,430 --> 02:48:41,590
I found the spot. Yeah, I kind of did. There's one. There's two. Oh, this game's fun. This is,

771
02:48:41,590 --> 02:49:09,989
this is just a fun little time waster. Fuck. Just reset it. You promised. What did I promise?

772
02:49:12,360 --> 02:49:27,219
Wait, what did I promise? What are you talking about? What did I promise? You promised. You

773
02:49:27,219 --> 02:49:33,079
promised three shots in a row. What do you think I'm trying to do? What do you think of what, what,

774
02:49:33,799 --> 02:49:38,739
I am promising that I'm going to get three in a row. So that means I'm going to do it until I

775
02:49:38,739 --> 02:49:56,040
get three in a row. Stop failing. Oh my God. You guys are getting in my head.

776
02:50:07,430 --> 02:50:34,040
That's not how you do it, son. I don't roll it. No, you don't. Oh, I had to roll. One, two. All

777
02:50:34,040 --> 02:51:09,559
right. All right, kids. Okay, kids. I did it. Three. Imagine going to one of these things and paying

778
02:51:09,559 --> 02:51:14,940
the money just to have fun and do this. But you're trying to get three in a row and your other two

779
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:21,459
balls, you just lift up, put them on the ground and say, no, I want to do it again. What a fucking

780
02:51:21,459 --> 02:51:33,020
weirdo. That's not going to go in. Oh my God. I'm fucking going to lose my mind. Just, I'm just

781
02:51:33,020 --> 02:51:38,219
going to grab this in one hand and crow hop and just push shot put throw it as hard as I can.

782
02:51:38,940 --> 02:52:01,239
Did that just go behind me? How does that make any sense? Why is this not doing this now? How

783
02:52:01,239 --> 02:52:21,399
did I, what am I wearing? What am I doing wrong? All right, I got this exact spot that I need.

784
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:51,100
I know exactly where to go. It's right on the wood. Oh my fucking God. Why is it doing this to me?

785
02:53:00,309 --> 02:53:08,149
I know I promised. Just relax. You promised. How many, it's like the teacher going with

786
02:53:08,149 --> 02:53:31,579
chaperoning the students and the whole bus is sitting behind me. You promised. I'm trying.

787
02:53:31,579 --> 02:53:34,540
All right. All right. This is the last one. It's the last. I don't care if I don't do it.

788
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:46,780
This is it. This is the one. This is the last one. I don't think it's going to happen right

789
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:58,010
now. Let me go get a goddamn ice cream. All right, kids. All right, kids. I'm going to do it.

790
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:14,489
Oh, just get on the bus. Get on the bus. Everybody get on the bus. Go, go, go on the bus. But you're

791
02:54:14,489 --> 02:54:48,569
not on the bus now. I can't, I can't do it. I can't do it. I don't think I can. I don't think I can

792
02:54:48,569 --> 02:55:12,329
do it. I really don't think I can do it. It's like lagging and bouncing. I can't do it. I'm just like

793
02:55:12,329 --> 02:55:42,379
the angry guy. He just like fucking whips it as hard as he can into the net. Oh my fucking god.

794
02:55:42,379 --> 02:55:47,399
Get me out of here. Just stop. Just get out. Just leave. Turn around. Just get on the bus.

795
02:55:47,399 --> 02:55:53,049
I'm out. I'm getting on the bus. I don't want any prizes. I don't deserve a prize.

796
02:55:53,770 --> 02:56:23,340
I want to give me a donut. New text message. Oh, I'm out of money. I'm out of money. Was it a pizza?

797
02:56:23,659 --> 02:56:40,569
Okay, that was fucking, that was not, that was rude. I need more money. I need, uh,

798
02:56:40,569 --> 02:56:44,170
is there any other games or is that the one that beat me? Is that the last one that's going to

799
02:56:44,170 --> 02:57:18,389
beat me? Do I still have my ride pass? No, let's go in here. I'm just going to make myself and

800
02:57:18,389 --> 02:57:28,100
everybody watching sick, I think. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Is it still here?

801
02:57:29,350 --> 02:57:39,899
Are we live? Oh god. Get off. I don't want to be on this ride. Not when the internet's having

802
02:57:39,899 --> 02:58:03,909
a problem. What the fuck is happening? This doesn't make any sense. This is just strange.

803
02:58:03,909 --> 02:58:08,950
What are they building over here? The UFO. Oh, is it? I know the UFO they're talking about.

804
02:58:08,950 --> 02:58:13,879
When you get in, you sit, you stand and your back goes against the wall and it spins you around

805
02:58:13,879 --> 02:58:25,979
really fast. Can I go in? No, fuck this thing. I hate this. I think I've only read, uh, read one

806
02:58:25,979 --> 02:58:42,360
of these. Yeah. Red road. I think I've only rode one of these once and I said never again.

807
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:49,799
I only read one of these. All right. Well, that's cool. Let's go back to Larry's so I can get my

808
02:58:49,799 --> 02:58:59,579
money back. Oh, I want to like play these again. All right. I'm going to just run to the machine

809
02:58:59,579 --> 02:59:16,440
and I have to beat the, I can't be beaten by the basketball. I just can't. What's the, yeah. Why

810
02:59:16,440 --> 02:59:21,700
do you need a flashlight in this game? There's really no reason for it. Wow. I'm just going to

811
02:59:21,700 --> 02:59:37,370
turn it off. I'm going to get one of these. I'm going to get one of these for that stream.

812
02:59:37,930 --> 02:59:47,350
I'm going to prove to you guys that I can do it. Okay. Now here we go. It's coming back.

813
02:59:48,389 --> 02:59:51,989
UFO arcade arcade has different games. It's not a ride. Oh, that's cool.

814
02:59:56,549 --> 03:00:40,469
I can't hear it. Look, I'm a fan. Hey, hey, give me that back. Yeah. Hey, that thing's worth money.

815
03:00:40,469 --> 03:00:54,680
Isn't it? That's, that's worth a lot of money. Oh God. It's right here. All right. I got money.

816
03:00:54,680 --> 03:01:09,930
Let's beat the basketball game. I'm going to beat the basketball. Warehouse factory. So these

817
03:01:09,930 --> 03:01:28,680
aren't done, right? Are we still live? Yeah. I don't know what the fuck's happening. I have no idea.

818
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:40,969
I wish I had an idea. So is there any more games to play? Is this the last one? Go to the gas

819
03:01:40,969 --> 03:01:56,280
station? Okay. Come on. All three of these. Come on. Just do it. I did not do the fireworks either.

820
03:02:00,149 --> 03:02:02,709
Fuck. Oh my God. Let me, let me try a different spot.

821
03:02:19,979 --> 03:02:23,020
Make sure the ball's level. Yeah. It's just bouncing around. I need to get a swish.

822
03:02:25,079 --> 03:02:30,540
That's probably the best spot to do it. Right here off the backboard, but it's just so,

823
03:02:36,739 --> 03:02:47,500
ah, you promised. I know. I know. I promise. No, it's, I gotta have to do it that way.

824
03:02:47,500 --> 03:02:55,399
This is bird. What? Yeah. What's with the bird thing? What are you guys saying? Bird, bird,

825
03:02:55,479 --> 03:03:03,159
something bird, Larry bird. What are you guys saying here? That's not it. I fucked it up.

826
03:03:05,299 --> 03:03:11,559
The bird game. I don't know. Somebody said like, oh yeah, this is bird, something bird.

827
03:03:19,670 --> 03:03:41,299
Did I just make that up in my head? No way. My God. What was the reference people were making

828
03:03:41,299 --> 03:03:45,719
when I was sitting here playing this? Somebody was, people were saying something. I gotta go

829
03:03:45,719 --> 03:04:03,579
higher. No, higher. I swear to God, somebody, people were saying like, like blue or something.

830
03:04:04,780 --> 03:04:21,700
There it is. These people in the bot are going to be like, oh, that's what he's talking about.

831
03:04:24,649 --> 03:04:39,739
All right. Here we go. This is it. I can finally be done. Oh, every time on the third one. Why?

832
03:04:40,860 --> 03:04:52,780
That was in the same exact spot. That was in the same spot. It really was. What did I do wrong?

833
03:04:54,729 --> 03:05:06,459
Now I can't do anything. Damn it. It's not worth it. This is, it is worth it. I'm going to leave

834
03:05:06,459 --> 03:05:29,430
again and come back after this try. I'm going to go play the fireworks or something. Whatever.

835
03:05:29,430 --> 03:05:36,520
I'm going to go to the gas station, gas station. Let's go. I don't want to play again. No, I'm done.

836
03:05:36,520 --> 03:05:50,180
Thank you. No, I don't want anything. Bye. All right. Let's go to, uh, where is it?

837
03:05:50,180 --> 03:06:18,100
Pier, Larry's, Barry's? Was there a gas station? Jerry's? Sorry. Jerry's. Okay. There we go.

838
03:06:18,100 --> 03:06:39,620
Jerry's gas station. Soft drinks. Can you play with these? Oh no. 25 dollars. Get the 25 dollars.

839
03:06:46,260 --> 03:07:00,090
No. Match three to win. Reveal three boats and get the special prize.

840
03:07:01,129 --> 03:07:17,290
Not a winner. Two, none. I gotta go get some more money. Match three sevens.

841
03:07:40,540 --> 03:07:56,139
No, no, no. Not Barry's. Larry's. Going and spending uncle's money on scratch tickets only.

842
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:10,329
Well, for a game that's just about like 15 to 20 little carnival and arcade game,

843
03:08:11,049 --> 03:08:34,090
there seems to be a lot more you can do. One guy is making this game. Yeah. Okay. Back to the gas

844
03:08:34,090 --> 03:08:44,700
station. You can do a paper route. Is that in the game yet though? I feel like is that something

845
03:08:44,700 --> 03:08:55,209
that I can actually do? It is. Okay. Well, hold on. Let me buy a couple of 25 dollar scratch tickets

846
03:08:55,209 --> 03:09:25,770
and then we'll go. Win. I get three, three fires. Oh my. What a piece of shit. Come on. Really?

847
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:42,739
In a row. Three boats. That's a fish. I need two more fishes. Ooh. A trunk full.

848
03:09:45,860 --> 03:09:53,219
Okay. It's two fifties. Give me another fifty. No more ones. Oh my god. This is a 25 dollar ticket.

849
03:10:16,340 --> 03:10:57,559
All right. Let me do the paper route. How many of these do I need to deliver? Is it a plane? No.

850
03:11:00,120 --> 03:11:12,069
How do I do this? So I have to deliver a paper here. Where's my golf card? I have the papers.

851
03:11:12,229 --> 03:11:23,979
No. Not again. Not again. Don't do it again. You've made us suffer enough cocks with this nonsense.

852
03:11:23,979 --> 03:11:42,299
Come on. All right. So I need to go over here. All right. Which one of these does it have to go in?

853
03:11:42,299 --> 03:11:45,579
There's a lot of mailboxes here. Which one is the one that who has the subscription?

854
03:12:19,479 --> 03:12:39,590
All right. I'm getting stuck on the cart. Give this to me. That's two dollars. In the time that

855
03:12:39,590 --> 03:13:01,479
it just took me to do that, I could have been in a great Uncle Phil's money machine for 10 seconds.

856
03:13:01,479 --> 03:13:23,770
Oh, I'd love that. I'm going to get a hundred bucks and then from there I'm going to do

857
03:13:23,770 --> 03:13:27,450
five scratch tickets and four scratch tickets. I have to win a scratch ticket once. We have to

858
03:13:27,450 --> 03:13:45,670
win every game once. I'm going to go back and do basketball again too. It's impossible to win.

859
03:13:46,389 --> 03:13:59,209
What do you mean? Hawn the newspapers. Are they worth more than two dollars?

860
03:14:00,170 --> 03:14:08,760
Why am I stuck? What are they? What are they? Oh, they're little. It's like string. You shoot like

861
03:14:08,760 --> 03:14:38,969
little stringies. It's a rubber band. Okay. One more. Just pawn stuff to that. Just hold on.

862
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:49,530
Let me get my bearings and see where we're at. You know what I'm saying? I might have 150. That's

863
03:14:49,530 --> 03:15:07,139
enough. Okay. This is my last 150 I'm putting into scratch tickets. Pawn one of the robots. I don't

864
03:15:07,299 --> 03:15:18,840
think I can do that. Remember when I won that one? Oh, I felt so good. All right. Let's pawn all

865
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:40,149
this shit. You're right. Let's get rid of it. Oh, no. I've been live for 17 minutes. No. It's

866
03:15:40,149 --> 03:15:44,709
actually been like three and a half hours. It's just the stream has made a new vaude like three

867
03:15:44,709 --> 03:16:05,530
or four times. They can't come in. All right. Let's pawn some stuff. Make some money. This is

868
03:16:05,610 --> 03:16:17,260
all my possessions. Hey Barry, I'm here with all my stuff. I have three newspapers and a bunch of

869
03:16:17,260 --> 03:16:28,920
pool toys. 50 cents. It's just a giant coin. All right. Can I put more things in there at one time?

870
03:16:33,260 --> 03:16:36,299
Let's see what happens. Can I do more than one? Yeah, you can do more than one.

871
03:16:37,819 --> 03:17:03,979
14 bucks. Really? What else is this stuff worth? You're selling memories.

872
03:17:04,540 --> 03:17:14,250
But the memory of me being addicted to a basketball game for like fucking an hour?

873
03:17:14,250 --> 03:17:34,600
I don't think that's a very good memory. The fish was 30 bucks. My last two possessions.

874
03:17:36,569 --> 03:17:48,219
The snake from the... I'm keeping you. How much does it work? 80 bucks. Holy shit. Get rid of it.

875
03:17:49,180 --> 03:18:27,959
All right. 330 bucks. 340. All right. Here we go. I'm the only person that's coming over.

876
03:18:29,319 --> 03:19:19,959
What did I have? I had 340, right? That wasn't done. It's all right. Four. All right. I'm doing

877
03:19:19,959 --> 03:19:42,920
all right. That's... I just need one more fish. 12 dollars and 50 cents. I lost 50% of what I put in.

878
03:19:42,920 --> 03:20:23,159
Car. Car. Ugh. You're playing minesweeper. Let chat do one. Okay. Chat can do the last one.

879
03:20:27,239 --> 03:20:36,620
All right. This is pretty good. Need one more fish. Holy shit. That is a boat right there.

880
03:20:36,620 --> 03:20:47,020
Need two more of those boats. This... All right. There's two. One, two, three, four, five, six,

881
03:20:47,020 --> 03:20:55,530
seven, eight, nine. There are nine slots left. Two out of nine has to be a boat. Okay. Whatever.

882
03:20:55,530 --> 03:21:27,030
I made my money back. You piece of shit. Come on. Got the money back. Three in a row. They're just

883
03:21:27,030 --> 03:21:49,819
sitting in a row. Unbelievable. I need one more fish. No more twos. Ugh. I just need to win the boat

884
03:21:51,159 --> 03:22:13,059
or a fish. All right. Somebody just... Somebody just wrote he's so bad. You can't be bad at picking

885
03:22:13,139 --> 03:22:44,090
random spaces. What does that even mean? Just give me the car. Ugh. Stop being so bad. I'm making a

886
03:22:44,090 --> 03:23:00,739
mess. All right. You guys can do the last ticket. You want to show me how it's done? Let's see. Show

887
03:23:00,739 --> 03:23:09,379
me how it's done. Good. Let's see how good you guys are at picking shit. Huh? Let's see how everybody

888
03:23:09,379 --> 03:23:21,020
is at picking things. It's going to be impossible to do this. I can't zoom in far enough. Do your

889
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:33,770
best. Let's see how well you do. Nobody talking shit about how you're talking shit. All right. Go

890
03:23:33,770 --> 03:23:49,000
ahead. Actually, it is going to work pretty well. All right. Right there in the middle. I see 25%

891
03:23:49,000 --> 03:24:00,379
of you clicking that one. That's the one we're going to do. 26%. Okay. Let's do it. Here it is.

892
03:24:00,379 --> 03:24:23,190
There's a three. 1250. Go again. What is the next scratch going to be? You guys are playing

893
03:24:23,190 --> 03:24:34,010
connect to four. That's how spread out this is. The one that's 13%.

894
03:24:36,549 --> 03:24:40,709
The one down the bottom right. That's the only has to be that one. Yeah. The one that one. That's

895
03:24:40,709 --> 03:25:15,190
14%. The car. It's the $50 car. Not a bad choice. Not bad at all. Okay. Keep going. By the way,

896
03:25:15,190 --> 03:25:25,420
all clicks on the left side on O, S, and H are not counted. There is no consensus here yet. Okay.

897
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:35,510
There is 16% want to do that one over on the left. That's the one it's going to be right here.

898
03:25:40,549 --> 03:25:57,370
Sorry. You were not. I was incorrect. Ready? Three, two, one. It's okay, chat. We can do it.

899
03:26:09,690 --> 03:26:18,299
Up in the corner. I'm doing it. Here we go. 30%. It's a four. Okay. You have two, three,

900
03:26:18,299 --> 03:26:33,530
four in the tank. So you're pretty spread out so far. Not bad. Where to next? You guys almost

901
03:26:33,530 --> 03:26:51,100
have a straight. Yeah. That's correct. Hmm. Pretty split between down the bottom and no,

902
03:26:51,100 --> 03:27:00,219
it looks like it's right there in the middle. Bottom middle. Somebody said at least we don't

903
03:27:00,219 --> 03:27:11,459
get ones. Oh, there's a hundred dollar fish ever so closer. You guys have almost every single one.

904
03:27:11,459 --> 03:27:17,719
That's a good thing to do though, because then you can deduction statistically. You are making

905
03:27:17,719 --> 03:27:29,180
it easier for you. I'm going to zero again. No, I'm not. All right. We're good. We've proven that

906
03:27:29,180 --> 03:27:36,819
you're bad at RNG. That's not really 73% of people want to go that way, right? That many people want

907
03:27:36,819 --> 03:27:48,469
to click the top left one. That's unheard of. We should do chat plays view in battleship.

908
03:27:51,399 --> 03:27:55,000
I mean, we could do that, but that would require me to have another person in here because I could

909
03:27:55,000 --> 03:28:10,149
just see you guys have every single one. All right. This is actually really good. Well, you

910
03:28:10,149 --> 03:28:24,389
don't have the boat yet. The last one that you're missing is the boat. I'm going to go down and

911
03:28:24,389 --> 03:28:32,120
scratch the void if removed. Is there any explanation as to why the void if removed

912
03:28:32,120 --> 03:28:50,569
is scratchable? Why would they put that there? All right, let's go. Oh, fuck. Oh God. You guys

913
03:28:50,569 --> 03:28:58,280
are in a good... This is the best spot you could possibly be in. One more fish and you have the

914
03:28:58,280 --> 03:29:16,100
second best prize you can get on this ticket. Go for it. You guys are going for it. Could it be

915
03:29:16,100 --> 03:29:21,430
the coveted three in a row? It might be. I don't know. That's where you want to go. That's where

916
03:29:21,430 --> 03:29:47,850
we're going to go. Nope. Are you guys going to leave here with a measly $25? Better than me. I

917
03:29:47,850 --> 03:30:00,860
got 25 like three times. All right. Is this your final answer? 47%. Good luck, guys. You would

918
03:30:00,860 --> 03:30:24,760
never... Yup. Congratulations. My turn. I do one, you do one. Okay. My turn. I do one more.

919
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:40,629
All right. Your turn. There's so much trash everywhere. I can't even pick it up.

920
03:30:41,110 --> 03:30:52,170
All right. Your turn. Your turn. What's wrong with this one? What's the prize under there? Can you

921
03:30:52,170 --> 03:31:10,100
see? This one's broken. Oh, it was a three. It was a three. It actually was a three. Oh no. Keep it

922
03:31:10,100 --> 03:31:33,049
going. It was the money symbol, but the other way. Kind of. Right here. You got it. First fish of the

923
03:31:33,049 --> 03:32:04,100
evening. Again. I would laugh so hard if you guys got three votes. Ready? You sure? Okay. Uh oh.

924
03:32:04,100 --> 03:32:18,420
Sorry, guys. That was not the right spot to be in. If we get three votes, we get to keep the

925
03:32:18,420 --> 03:32:38,920
winnings. That's not written anywhere. Okay. Here we go. It's a two. Two means none. If we get three

926
03:32:38,920 --> 03:32:55,639
votes, then you have to play salmon max. No. What? I'm going to do that anyways. All right. Let's...

927
03:32:55,719 --> 03:33:06,409
unanimous. Oh, shit. All right. There's the vote.

928
03:33:19,639 --> 03:33:29,340
Go ahead. We need a better incentive. What's something that you want me to do so bad that I

929
03:33:29,340 --> 03:33:34,760
won't do? I mean, I've played two seasons of salmon max. It's not like I wouldn't do that.

930
03:33:35,319 --> 03:33:47,430
What incentive? Doki doki? No. That... by the way, there's no consensus here. I gotta wait

931
03:33:47,430 --> 03:33:59,610
like another few minutes. Eat another McChicken. All right. We've got a majority.

932
03:34:00,329 --> 03:34:31,209
We're not a majority. We have just a winner. 1250. That leaves me one more chance to do it myself.

933
03:34:31,209 --> 03:35:43,979
Fuck. No, no, no, no. I don't want to come back here. I want to go... That's it? That's not even

934
03:35:43,979 --> 03:36:06,139
enough. That's not even enough for me to do it again. No, no, no. And I gotta... Oh, the F...

935
03:36:06,139 --> 03:36:15,190
Right. It's zoomed in. All right, guys. I'm going to... Here's the plan. Just relax for a minute.

936
03:36:15,190 --> 03:36:29,420
I am going to go get like $500. Just hang out. I'm just going to go get... I'm going to go just

937
03:36:29,420 --> 03:37:07,739
take a withdrawal of $500. Fuck. I need to get... I'll do it again. That was a weak poll.

938
03:37:26,540 --> 03:37:41,290
Biggly's close. Be the voice. Oh, well, look at what you did there. Oh, gonna try to get

939
03:37:41,290 --> 03:37:54,489
a big fish here now. Oh, that poll was a big poll now. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets now.

940
03:37:56,659 --> 03:38:10,680
100 tickets. 100 tickets. Oh, 100 tickets. No, it's not 100 tickets.

941
03:38:14,620 --> 03:38:25,139
You got yourself a thousand tickets. Come on. I'm gonna do as hard as I can and then leave.

942
03:38:29,420 --> 03:39:06,739
No, wrong way. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Wait. Is this fireworks? What do you got there?

943
03:39:06,739 --> 03:39:37,530
Where'd you get this? Where did you get this? Where'd you get that? Is he getting in trouble?

944
03:39:37,530 --> 03:39:45,909
All right. I'm out of money. I'm out of money. I don't know what to do. The beach? Hold on. I

945
03:39:45,909 --> 03:40:04,500
need to go back into dads because I need to make some money. Let's get some money. You guys all

946
03:40:04,500 --> 03:40:19,670
stand and then wait. Okay, just hang out for a little bit. Just chill. What's the best way

947
03:40:19,670 --> 03:40:30,969
for me to get money? I gotta be like in the right spot. Right here? Right here looks good.

948
03:40:32,090 --> 03:40:40,819
The banana guy's worth 80 bucks. Where can I get the banana guy? You're right. From the

949
03:40:41,299 --> 03:40:55,500
okay, I'm just gonna win the I got to go win a few times off that stage. This guy, this is the

950
03:40:55,500 --> 03:40:58,700
person in the suit though. I can't like bring that. All right. I got the idea. Hold on.

951
03:41:00,459 --> 03:41:16,200
I know what I'm gonna do. Let's go to the pier and I'm gonna go win the banana like 10 times.

952
03:41:16,920 --> 03:41:20,540
I'm gonna have like three grand. We're gonna buy like 40 scratch tickets.

953
03:41:21,540 --> 03:42:54,549
Where is he? It's the darts, right? That's the easiest thing in the game. I win. I didn't get

954
03:42:54,549 --> 03:43:16,569
anything. What? I know it's loud. Just turn it down a little bit. That's three. I gotta do it.

955
03:43:18,020 --> 03:43:24,120
There's whack-a-mole. Where's whack? Where? Where? Where's whack-a-mole? I didn't see whack-a-mole.

956
03:43:30,420 --> 03:43:34,420
Oh, let me help you here. I'm gonna turn this down. This is probably killing you.

957
03:43:52,579 --> 03:44:18,979
Oh my god. Did I mute it? I turned way down. You should be able to still hear it. Dang, sir. Why?

958
03:44:20,420 --> 03:44:44,409
What are you talking about? I'm... What's a movie I could watch at any time? Um, Gremlins 2. That's

959
03:44:44,409 --> 03:44:55,100
it, right? Okay. One more. One more. And that's 80 bucks. Because I'm in it. You guys know that

960
03:44:55,100 --> 03:45:02,920
friends of mine, way before any of you guys made that reference, uh, friends of mine told me that

961
03:45:02,920 --> 03:45:19,379
same thing. That I'm just the guy with the tie. It looks... It's... We're identical twins. Okay.

962
03:45:19,379 --> 03:45:26,540
You had a friend before Twitch? Yeah, I did. Okay, so I got 80 dollars... 80 bucks there.

963
03:45:26,540 --> 03:46:07,219
There's gotta be a better way. I can swish it, I think. Hold on. Pay for it again. How many

964
03:46:07,219 --> 03:46:50,459
credits do I have? How... What's the mo... Okay, I can turn this back up. Uh, yeah, I didn't know

965
03:46:50,459 --> 03:47:05,829
I had that many credits there. All right, so this is fine. So that's... How do I have to back a truck

966
03:47:05,829 --> 03:47:19,159
back here? Oh, no. Not good. That's all my inventory space. It's... It'll be here when I come back.

967
03:47:19,159 --> 03:47:27,030
Let me find where the swish is. I'm gonna say if I go, like, let's go to the top, like, up here.

968
03:47:30,170 --> 03:47:39,590
Okay, hold on a minute. This actually might work. I gotta find the swish right between the A and the

969
03:47:39,590 --> 03:48:02,809
B. Right under the A. Right, like, at the blue line. Nope. A little bit lower. Top of the backboard.

970
03:48:02,809 --> 03:48:34,409
Close. Top of the red. That's it. That's it. It's a fucking exploit. That's two. No, dude, I need three.

971
03:48:34,409 --> 03:48:41,030
I need three. I found it. I got it. That's the one right there. Right at the top of the red in the

972
03:48:41,030 --> 03:48:50,139
backboard. It's a swish. And here we go. Get... Everyone get back off of the bus because this is

973
03:48:50,139 --> 03:49:14,280
gonna be it. Swish. Again. Oh my god. I'm gonna get it. I'll do it. It's gonna happen. Why do I choke

974
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:51,989
on every third fall? Why? Just get it up there. I just started itching my armpits. Right there.

975
03:49:51,989 --> 03:50:06,979
How does it... How does it change from the last time? How did it change from the last time?

976
03:50:15,459 --> 03:50:20,100
Consistent power? I'm... I am. I'm holding it down the whole time. That's why I'm trying to find the

977
03:50:20,100 --> 03:50:26,100
one spot where I can be in. It's probably something stupid like... Yeah, like somebody said the wind.

978
03:50:26,100 --> 03:50:50,170
I wouldn't be surprised. I... Yeah, I know it sways in my hands. That's why I've been waiting for it

979
03:50:50,170 --> 03:50:56,680
to get in the middle. It goes back and forth. That's why the line in the middle... I'm trying

980
03:50:56,680 --> 03:51:02,680
to keep it just right in the middle. That's why every time I've waited till it was in the middle.

981
03:51:04,219 --> 03:51:26,149
Like that. This variance... This is some kind of variance when you throw it. It's never gonna

982
03:51:26,229 --> 03:51:36,040
happen. Yeah, you have to get lucky. No, I don't want to... I want to stop this. I can't even click

983
03:51:36,040 --> 03:51:41,719
done. I can't... I can't get out. I'm stuck here now because I have no inventory space.

984
03:51:42,360 --> 03:52:40,180
All right, get this shit out of the way. Free stuff, kids. Take it. It counts! It counts! It counts!

985
03:52:40,180 --> 03:52:51,540
Counts! Counts! Counts! Counts! Counts! Oh, I keep... People are gonna say it didn't count.

986
03:52:51,540 --> 03:52:56,180
It counts. It went in and went out. In real basketball, if it does that, it counts.

987
03:53:02,940 --> 03:53:06,840
It counts. It counts. It counts. No, it counts. It counts. It's over. I win.

988
03:53:06,840 --> 03:53:18,659
In real basketball, if it goes in and then goes out, it counts. Yeah, I win. I did it. I did it

989
03:53:18,659 --> 03:53:32,579
three times in a row. All right. Okay, cool. Guys, thanks for watching the video. Weird how I did

990
03:53:32,579 --> 03:54:03,639
that first try. All right, let's get the fuck out of here. Wait, can I scan these and take them out?

991
03:54:03,639 --> 03:54:21,239
And then pull them out? No, I can't. I can't scan the machine. What are these worth? They're worth

992
03:54:21,319 --> 03:54:29,000
$14 a piece. That's actually really good. How much are the cats worth?

993
03:54:29,719 --> 03:55:12,809
Eleven. So why would I even get the cat? It's worth less. That's a lot of money. Is it given

994
03:55:12,809 --> 03:55:48,579
to me in ones? All right, I got 228 bucks. All right, that's enough for good old scratch tickets.

995
03:55:48,579 --> 03:56:29,850
Fucking mess out of the way. How am I gonna get? Like eight? Ten? Okay, I'm gonna do the first three

996
03:56:29,850 --> 03:57:23,659
and then you guys can do one. All right, cool. Slow down. I got two cars. I got a boat. Come on,

997
03:57:23,979 --> 03:57:45,659
look at how many spaces there are. Oh my god. I'm gonna do a technique. The whole

998
03:57:45,659 --> 03:57:53,510
just the whole bottom row and then the whole top row. It's our turn. No, it's not. Not yet.

999
03:59:03,420 --> 03:59:28,780
Why are they missing spaces? Got it. Four bucks. Yes, I am brute forcing scratch tickets. Yes,

1000
03:59:28,780 --> 03:59:57,209
I am. Okay, they're deleting spaces. I'm out. All right, here, your turn. Okay.

1001
03:59:57,930 --> 04:00:05,590
Yeah, you can do that. Yeah, let me do this one. Okay, you can do this one. You can do the,

1002
04:00:05,590 --> 04:00:26,360
yeah, here. You can do this one. Here you go. Wait, now you have to do with it. Okay,

1003
04:00:26,360 --> 04:00:32,260
we want the other one. We want the other one. We want. All right. Okay, all right.

1004
04:00:32,979 --> 04:00:55,829
I'll let you do that one here. All right, you can do this one. Okay, go ahead. I don't know

1005
04:00:55,829 --> 04:01:10,969
if I can even click this one. I'll try. Ooh, it's the trunk full $50. Nice work so far, guys.

1006
04:01:10,969 --> 04:01:30,040
Can you keep it up? Oh, you guys. Oh, but I don't know what you guys are. I don't know. Okay,

1007
04:01:30,040 --> 04:01:47,430
well, you're clicking it. Yeah, I guess you're clicking it. Did you get the ad? Because I just

1008
04:01:47,430 --> 04:01:53,299
played an ad. Apparently commercial break failed. Commercial breaks are only allowed once every

1009
04:01:53,299 --> 04:02:12,059
eight minutes. How does a commercial break fail? That doesn't make any sense. I just clicked run

1010
04:02:12,059 --> 04:02:22,090
ad. No, sorry, it didn't work. But you can't click that again. All right. Well, I can't do it. I

1011
04:02:22,090 --> 04:02:44,700
tried. Do it again. Try again. It's because nobody wants to sponsor you. I don't need a sponsorship.

1012
04:02:46,680 --> 04:03:07,579
I have 5,000 friends here. Think I need a sponsorship? He thinks we like, he thinks we're

1013
04:03:07,579 --> 04:03:15,319
friends. They think we're friends. He thinks we're friends. Why are we both lying to each other? What

1014
04:03:15,319 --> 04:03:34,729
are you talking about? Nope, don't act like that. There's a four. Sorry, guys. We're not real. You're

1015
04:03:34,729 --> 04:03:49,879
very real. All of you. Hmm. Very split on this one. Looks like this is going to be the one.

1016
04:03:51,620 --> 04:03:58,409
We have five community subs that just came in. Thank you for the five community subs.

1017
04:03:59,209 --> 04:04:06,200
It was Piffinator. Thank you, Piff. Guys aren't doing so well on this one. But thanks for the

1018
04:04:06,200 --> 04:04:12,649
community subs. I was just like, I just burped really loud. Hopefully you didn't hear that.

1019
04:04:17,989 --> 04:04:27,299
Win. Which one? Where do you want me to go? Event? I have to get the car eventually.

1020
04:04:27,299 --> 04:04:39,780
We're going over here. You almost, you're almost done. One more three and that's it guys.

1021
04:04:46,260 --> 04:04:51,530
I'll click over here. Click, click feet. No, that's okay. That's not, that's like the

1022
04:04:51,530 --> 04:05:03,739
soda machine. Torpedo sneak. Thanks for the five community subs. Another five gifter come through.

1023
04:05:03,739 --> 04:05:15,340
Thank you so much. Congratulations to the people that got those subs right here. Oh no. Oh no.

1031
04:06:32,459 --> 04:06:38,219
Magellan, thanks for the five community subs. This is the one here. This is it. Okay. If you

1032
04:06:38,219 --> 04:06:43,270
guys don't get this, then I get to buy five more and just spam them. You actually got it. Holy shit.

1033
04:06:43,270 --> 04:07:22,700
They did it. Okay. $50 winner. Nice work, guys. That's my turn. Give me another spade. All right. I

1034
04:07:22,700 --> 04:07:33,719
won two. I won two. I have to win on this one though. I got two for the price of one. You see,

1035
04:07:33,719 --> 04:07:54,180
that two came out. Thanks for winning the $50, guys. I'm putting it to great use. It's my turn

1036
04:07:54,180 --> 04:08:11,379
to get the car. I have to match you guys. It can't be all right in this area. Oh my God. There's a

1037
04:08:11,379 --> 04:08:29,319
boat. I did it too. I did it too. We're even. I did it too. And I'm going to get the fish.

1038
04:08:30,649 --> 04:09:06,250
What happened? Oh, okay. Let's come on. I can get a fish here. Damn it. I can't click the spades.

1039
04:09:06,250 --> 04:09:32,889
It's empty. Come on. No, I can't say it. Holy shit. I got a hot fire. Oh, okay. I need your help.

1040
04:09:32,889 --> 04:09:40,540
I need everybody's help. This is 250 bucks. I need your help. This is the ultimate win. Help me. We

1041
04:09:40,540 --> 04:10:03,959
need to do this together. The broken space? I don't know if I can click the broken space.

1042
04:10:03,959 --> 04:10:18,489
I'll try. That wasn't it. That wasn't it. Got it wrong. I had to click that like 10 times.

1043
04:10:21,690 --> 04:10:24,889
You think it's going to be three in a row? It might, but it might be three in a row

1044
04:10:25,690 --> 04:10:40,620
this way. Not this way. I don't know. I guess. All right. Oh, guys. Come on. No. No, it's not

1045
04:10:40,620 --> 04:10:55,399
working. Thankfully, there's still plenty of spaces because that's the only one I have two of. Okay.

1046
04:10:58,520 --> 04:11:08,739
Right to the right. See if it's three in a row. Hot fire. Hot fire. Hot fire. No, it's water. There

1047
04:11:08,739 --> 04:11:18,840
are now two waters in play. This is our only opportunity to get the ultimate win on any of

1048
04:11:18,840 --> 04:11:32,659
these tickets. I think, you know, there's an equal chance of winning no matter where you click. And

1049
04:11:32,659 --> 04:12:26,059
this is all pointless. What are you talking about? What do you mean? God damn it. Going

1050
04:12:26,059 --> 04:12:32,489
into a gas station and seeing this shit. This would be really, really, really fucking bad.

1051
04:12:32,489 --> 04:12:59,780
I would have gotten thrown out a long time ago. Hold on. Come on. Not a bad start. Come on.

1052
04:13:01,670 --> 04:13:30,309
Pawn the old tickets. I can't actually do this, right? Well, I got enough for one more. What's

1053
04:13:30,309 --> 04:14:04,139
with the fours? This is... I can do it again. I only clicked on threes. Fuck. Come on. Just let me win

1054
04:14:04,139 --> 04:14:27,899
a bay. Let me get a hot ticket item. We're just going to zero. Who cares? We're going to one cent.

1055
04:14:27,899 --> 04:14:41,209
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'll fix it. All right. We're good. We're good.

1056
04:14:43,379 --> 04:15:03,379
Let's go try. How much can I get for the tickets? Can I just feed them into there

1057
04:15:03,379 --> 04:15:22,809
if I look up high enough? 50 cents. It's not even worth doing this. I can go just get money from

1058
04:15:22,809 --> 04:15:38,889
Uncle faster than this. Yeah. I might as well go on the money sheen. Money sheen? The money machine.

1059
04:15:39,700 --> 04:15:51,030
Rather than just throw in like the crumpled up ramen bags. What is that? Fucking three bucks?

1060
04:15:51,030 --> 04:16:06,569
Five bucks? Eleven bucks? Six bucks? No. Just leave them. I'm still holding the arcade tickets?

1061
04:16:07,819 --> 04:16:21,479
Oh. Let's go. Let's go back and get some money. I'm gonna go to the beach. We haven't been here yet.

1062
04:16:21,479 --> 04:16:34,889
Are there any games on the beach? There's fireworks at the beach. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

1063
04:16:34,889 --> 04:17:17,750
How much are these? Ten dollars? Five dollars? How do I use it? Like that. Okay. Taxi? Taxi?

1064
04:17:17,750 --> 04:17:39,930
All right. I want to go back here. I'm going to get some more money and then I want to... What's

1065
04:17:39,930 --> 04:17:44,569
the... I want to... What do I want to do? I kind of want to play more of these. I'm fucked. I really

1066
04:17:44,569 --> 04:17:58,940
want to play these again. Which one do I want to play? Let's go get money from Dad first.

1067
04:18:05,559 --> 04:18:15,530
What's the most expensive thing? That's like the ultimate win, right? A hundred thousand tickets

1068
04:18:15,530 --> 04:19:07,340
is to get the boombox. I think I can do it. How do I escape this? Cover your ears. What can I sell

1069
04:19:07,340 --> 04:19:30,340
the boombox for? That's the question. Probably a lot. Okay. Let's go play the... Which is the one

1070
04:19:30,340 --> 04:19:54,360
that's easier? The ball drop one or the hockey? You can tell I've lost a step since when I won

1071
04:19:54,360 --> 04:20:03,340
this last time. No. No. No. No. What... This one. This... I just get... Go for the ones that are 500.

1072
04:20:11,450 --> 04:20:17,000
This is probably the best way to do this. Five, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 45. All right. I have to

1073
04:20:17,000 --> 04:20:30,139
get 10 of these to get 5,000. I missed. I need to get 200 balls.

1074
04:20:35,940 --> 04:20:49,739
Well, that's not going to happen. 200. At least I'll be able to get... Well, we're getting a good

1075
04:20:49,739 --> 04:21:09,579
start here. Not bad. 1,500. The hockey game is 2,500 if you get all the fucks. Yeah. Tickets?

1076
04:21:10,219 --> 04:21:19,000
One more ticket. Oh, right. It's a thousand... What about this one? How bad is this one?

1077
04:21:22,680 --> 04:21:36,629
What are we looking for? The green ones, right? Just go anywhere. Isn't there green rings down

1078
04:21:36,629 --> 04:21:45,110
there somewhere? See? Dizzy Bird. I wasn't making... Oh, that's the name of this game.

1079
04:21:45,110 --> 04:21:49,700
When I was shooting the basketball, people were like, oh, at least it's not Dizzy Bird.

1080
04:21:49,700 --> 04:21:53,700
Not Bird. Dizzy Bird. I'm like, what the fuck are they talking about? That's what I was talking

1081
04:21:53,700 --> 04:22:11,350
about. That's a pretty good haul right there. It's not as effective though. Come on. Pick up

1082
04:22:11,350 --> 04:22:24,700
like fucking eight of them. I'm going to try to get this 100 right here. Grab that one right there.

1083
04:22:24,700 --> 04:22:38,940
Slide it. Oh. Didn't get it. That's a pretty good haul. It's a pretty good haul.

1084
04:22:41,750 --> 04:22:52,250
Okay. Let's give Dizzy Bird a try. I feel like he's going to help us out here. Look.

1085
04:23:00,489 --> 04:23:05,049
Oh, man. I thought I did it first fucking try. I thought I did it... Oh, well. I tried. It was

1086
04:23:05,049 --> 04:23:15,319
close. What about this one? This one's pretty good. Uh, pond, pond, right?

1087
04:23:18,790 --> 04:23:28,819
Getting the Mega Jackpot. Come on. What's that? Mystery? Mystery bonus?

1088
04:23:35,059 --> 04:23:36,899
I'll take it. That sounds pretty good to me. Nice.

1089
04:23:42,010 --> 04:23:46,090
Shit. I got to get that. What's the Mega Jackpot? It's not even listed.

1090
04:23:47,860 --> 04:23:53,770
Jackpot. It's 2,100. What's the Mega Jackpot? It's not even listed.

1091
04:23:54,569 --> 04:24:13,690
Oh. Add a bonus ball. We're going to wait for that. Wait for the Jackpot to come back again.

1092
04:24:16,729 --> 04:24:23,139
Pretty close. Under the table. What about it?

1093
04:24:27,670 --> 04:24:37,979
Bonus ball. Oh, it's just doing it. I didn't even click. What does this mean? Get in there.

1094
04:24:41,639 --> 04:24:57,000
Oh. That's coming to the side of the machine. There are tickets over there.

1095
04:24:57,000 --> 04:24:58,280
You're right. There are tickets that way.

1096
04:25:13,860 --> 04:25:20,059
Get in. I thought I was going to go on the jackpot. $50. I just won 50 bucks right there.

1097
04:25:20,059 --> 04:25:28,469
Bonus ball. The ball of koala just gave me $50 and then I got the jackpot. This is fucking 10,000

1098
04:25:28,469 --> 04:25:34,629
tickets. This is going to be a big haul. I bet you can't get the double green on Dizzy Bird.

1099
04:25:37,450 --> 04:25:44,010
Thanks for the 50 bucks, ball of koala. Bonus ball. But first of all, we've got to talk about

1100
04:25:44,010 --> 04:25:51,180
the big haul that's coming out through here. I reset both the jackpots. Bonus ball. Two Mega

1101
04:25:51,180 --> 04:26:05,829
Jackpots. Do it. All right. This is like 12,000 tickets. Jesus Christ. How is that not 12,000?

1102
04:26:08,540 --> 04:26:15,780
What? The top was like 4,800 and the... What do you... What's this mean? What do you mean by that?

1103
04:26:27,129 --> 04:26:40,709
We're like 10% of the way there. 14 tickets, guys. Who cares? Who even wants these? All right.

1104
04:26:42,069 --> 04:26:51,700
Okay. Let's do the hockey. I gotta get a hockey. That's 500. I'm all right with this.

1105
04:26:58,090 --> 04:27:05,370
It's too slow. It's too slow. The fish game. The fish game's not gonna... The fish games

1106
04:27:05,370 --> 04:27:25,500
will be very inefficient. Just like the Bruins. What? Get in there. We want the bird game. No.

1107
04:27:26,139 --> 04:27:32,299
That's not efficient. This is more efficient. If I can... I gotta get hockey at least once.

1108
04:27:32,299 --> 04:27:56,200
2,500 guaranteed tickets. All right. I gotta be early. Like right... The bird is not efficient.

1109
04:27:56,200 --> 04:27:58,600
The bird sucks. It's not gonna help us at all.

1110
04:28:01,319 --> 04:28:15,270
This is actually turning out to be very inefficient as well. Am I scoring on my own goal?

1111
04:28:16,149 --> 04:28:31,979
All right. I got the C. We've got plenty of time. There's a shitload of tickets on the ground.

1112
04:28:40,469 --> 04:29:07,690
Oh. H. Oh, you kidding me? Really? Do they stay forever? They have to, right? Well, the one...

1113
04:29:07,690 --> 04:29:12,809
At least the one cool part is the soundtrack, the sound right now is doing the thing. When you go

1114
04:29:12,809 --> 04:29:21,049
into a place like Radio Shack that has a keyboard and it's on display and you're allowed to play

1115
04:29:21,049 --> 04:29:26,010
with it, you just do the same four chords like the same chord like a thousand times. That's

1116
04:29:26,010 --> 04:29:34,020
like all I hear. You turn it on. You put it on like the horn and you just press down on the same

1117
04:29:34,020 --> 04:29:41,020
chord. It was hard for me to say that because it was so loud in my ear that it was making me

1118
04:29:41,020 --> 04:29:54,860
hard to talk. I was getting speech jammed by the fucking Radio Shack keyboard. All right.

1119
04:29:54,860 --> 04:30:22,579
I just need an Y and an H. All right. Sir, sir, sir, sir. Can you stop that, please?

1120
04:30:24,219 --> 04:30:27,020
You're really pissing off all the customers here. $2,000.

1121
04:30:40,940 --> 04:30:44,819
2200 tickets. All right. Let's get them. I don't want to play again.

1122
04:30:46,420 --> 04:30:51,739
All right. Let's go. Feed it in. How many do I have?

1123
04:30:51,739 --> 04:31:06,180
10% of the way there. All right. What's the most pumped? What about these ones?

1124
04:31:06,899 --> 04:31:19,659
No, this thing's really bad, right? What about the stackums? What gives the most tickets?

1125
04:31:20,299 --> 04:31:26,659
This thing is awful. The Big Bass is the worst machine. It gives like four tickets, guys,

1126
04:31:26,659 --> 04:31:33,209
even if it was a thousand. That's not worth it. I can go get a thousand right now from the hockey

1127
04:31:33,290 --> 04:31:47,059
game. Oh, you got yourself 10 tickets. That's terrible. I didn't give this one a chance.

1128
04:31:51,899 --> 04:32:23,260
So you knock down all the stuff. Don't touch shovel handle. What happens if you get all the

1129
04:32:23,260 --> 04:32:46,360
chests? That's all chests. That's it? What's the top one? I don't have to get all the balls off?

1130
04:32:46,440 --> 04:33:21,669
I'm gonna do this like a lawn. All right. I'm ready. Here we go. How the fuck are you supposed

1131
04:33:21,669 --> 04:33:29,849
to do this? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why was it? Was it not counting these treasures before?

1132
04:33:35,770 --> 04:34:30,650
Let's get inside out. What? Oh, I touched the shovel. Shit. Do it again. Inside out. I'm out of

1133
04:34:30,650 --> 04:34:42,470
time. I feel like this one's too rigged. I'm gonna do one more technique.

1134
04:34:43,930 --> 04:35:18,580
It's not a bad technique if you go around in a circle and you push out.

1135
04:35:22,490 --> 04:35:30,900
Last try. Yeah, it's like scrubbing a toilet. It is. Let's try that again, but I'm gonna start

1136
04:35:30,900 --> 04:35:36,490
right from the middle. I'm just gonna do a circle around it. Just get right here. Don't touch it.

1137
04:35:36,490 --> 04:35:41,130
You just go like this. Oh, fuck. That's how you do it. I know that's how you do it. You gotta go.

1138
04:35:41,130 --> 04:36:22,790
You get a toilet brush it. You just gotta be very careful. This game's stupid. This is

1139
04:36:22,790 --> 04:36:52,060
dumb. All right. What about the coin ones? Why is he so bad? No, stop that. Stop saying that.

1140
04:36:52,060 --> 04:37:05,849
You know it makes me angry. Hold on. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna stop at the minor prize this time

1141
04:37:05,849 --> 04:37:29,639
and see how many tickets it is. All right. How many tickets is the minor prize? What a joke.

1142
04:37:29,639 --> 04:37:39,529
Not even worth it. How much was this one? A hundred? Does it increase in value as you

1143
04:37:39,529 --> 04:38:00,680
go up? I bet it does. Did I just fucking do that first try? I did. So how much is the top row?

1144
04:38:00,680 --> 04:38:10,439
It has to be worth something. If this is a hundred tickets, then why the hell did you ever do this?

1145
04:38:11,639 --> 04:38:31,259
All right. Well, okay. Terror. That sounds good to me. Just do that every time. I can do this.

1146
04:38:50,389 --> 04:38:57,939
No, a little too early. I can hold it a little longer. I need to do this 88 times.

1147
04:39:03,750 --> 04:39:20,180
And you want me to do the bass game? What's more reliable? I did it too high. Too high. The bird is

1148
04:39:20,180 --> 04:39:33,990
faster. Let us play the lottery tickets again. But yeah, I have to have money before I do that

1149
04:39:33,990 --> 04:39:39,880
and I make money by doing this and then get in the boom box and sell in the boom box. That's it.

1150
04:39:42,139 --> 04:39:50,970
All right. This is stupid. I did it first try. Nobody who cares. Just give me my thousand

1151
04:39:50,970 --> 04:40:02,520
tickets and get me out of here. All right. Prize balls. This seems the fastest.

1152
04:40:12,459 --> 04:40:21,099
1500 is ski balls the most reliable? Is it though? How many tickets do you get for doing ski ball?

1153
04:40:26,919 --> 04:40:44,419
Come on. That's a good, that's a good grab. Yeah, it is. Do ball drop. Just, you can ace it every

1154
04:40:44,419 --> 04:41:01,639
time. Is it, is it 500 or a thousand? Doing the ball drop. I mean, this is two grand. You

1155
04:41:01,639 --> 04:41:11,290
know what I'm saying? Like how long is that? 30 seconds. Five, 10, 15. That was 15, 10. All

1156
04:41:11,290 --> 04:41:25,720
right. Hold on. Let me feed that through. How much does the headphone sell for? Um, I think 100.

1157
04:41:26,439 --> 04:41:39,159
Let me see. How efficient am I in this one? I'm usually pretty efficient, right? It fights. What

1158
04:41:39,159 --> 04:42:11,659
is it? What's the jackpot? 500? 500, right? All right. This is the only game they come over to

1159
04:42:11,659 --> 04:42:19,369
congratulate you on. Do it again. Let's go. I just need to do this like 115 times.

1160
04:42:22,220 --> 04:43:26,500
Okay. Until I, do it until I, until I don't do it. And okay. Go. Go until I lose.

1161
04:44:13,830 --> 04:44:36,090
What is so funny? This. Okay. I fucked it up. Got it.

1162
04:44:37,990 --> 04:44:56,419
Weee. Only, this never before. Is anything like this ever possible?

1163
04:44:58,709 --> 04:45:18,229
I fucking blew it. It's, I need to move on. I'm like, what I'm doing right now?

1164
04:45:19,110 --> 04:45:25,560
I'm playing a fake arcade machine. There's a, this is a, there's a real version of this and there's

1165
04:45:25,560 --> 04:45:31,080
like 5,000 people watching me do the fake arcade machine to try to make

1166
04:45:31,159 --> 04:45:37,479
100,000 fake tickets to buy a fake boom box to scratch fake lottery tickets on stream.

1167
04:45:43,450 --> 04:45:50,889
It's like starting to get in my head. All right. So.

1168
04:45:55,380 --> 04:46:11,270
Okay. I need to fucking relax. What do I have? 15%? What's the most? Okay. Ski ball. Somebody said

1169
04:46:11,270 --> 04:46:23,540
do ski ball. Is this actually efficient if I just do it right down the middle? That's 40. A little

1170
04:46:23,540 --> 04:46:32,759
bit higher, right? Right before the yellow? No, that's too high. That's too higher? Higher?

1171
04:46:32,759 --> 04:46:51,349
That's too higher. I'm sorry guys. That's a little too higher. There it is. What was up with that?

1172
04:46:52,889 --> 04:46:59,189
Jerma, wake up, please. Stop that.

1173
04:47:10,659 --> 04:47:13,619
You want to know what your tarot reading said? My friend says you'll freak out.

1174
04:47:14,520 --> 04:47:18,439
No, I don't want to do tarot reading. I thought about it would be fun to do like a tarot reading

1175
04:47:18,439 --> 04:47:23,720
on stream of myself, but it's probably going to be like death, death, death, puke, puke,

1176
04:47:24,279 --> 04:47:42,360
like you're going to lose all your money for that pathetic display. That's not bad. Hold on.

1177
04:47:45,259 --> 04:48:11,000
What is up with this physics? The claw. Somebody did the math and that was another thing I was

1178
04:48:11,000 --> 04:48:17,400
laughing at. Somebody did the math and they said you just do the balloon claw game and try to get

1179
04:48:17,479 --> 04:48:24,200
what free 500 balloons. And if you just do it efficiently, it'll take 22 minutes.

1180
04:48:25,080 --> 04:48:29,560
And then I'm sitting there thinking, is that, is that, do I really want to do that?

1181
04:48:29,560 --> 04:48:46,340
I don't know if that's something I actually wanted to. 600. Come on, give me 600.

1182
04:48:48,020 --> 04:49:03,509
You did the bird game for 54 minutes. That's, yes, that is also true. All right, let's go.

1183
04:49:03,750 --> 04:49:12,380
Um, what about these? No, that's not that efficient either. Okay, I'm going to go for

1184
04:49:12,380 --> 04:49:28,060
balloons for a little while until I can't take it anymore. You've been playing this for five hours.

1185
04:49:28,060 --> 04:49:32,779
You can do 22 minutes on the balloons. Yeah, but it's, there's a difference between

1186
04:49:32,779 --> 04:49:41,259
bonds at 22 straight minutes of me picking up 500 ticket balloons. That's a different story.

1187
04:49:48,119 --> 04:49:58,439
I missed. Bird game streams are entertaining to watch you.

1188
04:50:19,779 --> 04:50:27,290
You know, if it was allowed, 22 minutes is a one episode of Spongebob. I would just put it on the

1189
04:50:27,290 --> 04:50:44,409
screen and just do this. All right, let's do it. Hold on. What happens if you do, can I overflow

1190
04:50:44,409 --> 04:50:51,939
the balls? Put it on the background. No, I can't do that. I will get actually like terms of service

1191
04:50:51,939 --> 04:51:02,180
screamed at. What's the red ones? How much are the red ones worth?

1192
04:51:03,540 --> 04:51:23,459
250? What if I get them all? Just have text to speech, read a Spongebob script.

1193
04:51:43,029 --> 04:51:50,540
You can't fit that many characters in a text to speech program. Just read it and play every part.

1194
04:51:50,540 --> 04:52:10,020
I can't do that and play. Hold on. Let me just get out of this. Is it, is it okay? Is there a website

1195
04:52:10,020 --> 04:52:15,299
where I can have that happen that can take like a like that's too long to put in a text to speech

1196
04:52:15,299 --> 04:52:47,259
box? You read it. I can't do that. Put it into Google Translate. Oh my God. Hold on. Let me wait,

1197
04:52:47,259 --> 04:53:01,000
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is this even possible? This is Spongebob.Fan. This is the Mermaid Man and

1198
04:53:01,000 --> 04:53:26,139
Barnacle Boy transcript. Is this actually the right one? Is this a fan one? This, this is,

1199
04:53:26,139 --> 04:53:38,040
this doesn't seem to be very much dialogue. So this is the Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy

1200
04:53:39,000 --> 04:53:52,169
of reenactment by, and we're going to do speed, speed like three or four. Okay. Okay. Here we go.

1201
04:53:52,169 --> 04:53:59,290
Just relax. Oh my God. It's crashing my computer. I think.

1202
04:54:14,810 --> 04:54:20,889
Also these guys. Barnacle Boy enters the Krusty Krab. Barnacle Boy. I told you I'm not hungry.

1203
04:54:20,889 --> 04:54:26,490
Mermaid Man. Mermaid Man and nonsense. Barnacle Boy. We've got to keep up our strength for the

1204
04:54:26,490 --> 04:54:32,580
fight against evil. Barnacle Boy. Want to dive Mermaid Man to the register. Runs to the register.

1205
04:54:34,580 --> 04:54:40,630
Can I help you? It's too fast. It's too fast. It's too fast. It's too fast. And that's like the

1206
04:54:40,630 --> 04:54:45,189
jokey. That's like the meme guy. It's gotta be somebody else. All right. We'll try this.

1207
04:54:46,459 --> 04:54:52,939
Squidward. Can I help you? Mermaid Man. A double Krabby Patty and Coral Bits for me

1208
04:54:52,939 --> 04:54:59,580
and a silly meal for the lad. Barnacle Boy. It's not for the toy. I just, I've got to fit in the

1209
04:54:59,580 --> 04:55:07,590
tights. Why can't oh, he smiles nervously. Squidward. Whatever. Five dollars. Please.

1210
04:55:08,740 --> 04:55:16,119
Mermaid Man. You got it. Bucky. Removes his left seashell cup. Opens the shell up like a clutch

1211
04:55:16,119 --> 04:55:20,919
purse and pulls out a metal nut. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Did I get

1212
04:55:20,919 --> 04:55:29,700
fucking linked to something fucked up here? Is this the, is this an actual real one? This is not

1213
04:55:29,700 --> 04:55:43,459
something fucked up weird like mermaid man porn thing, right? This is the episode. Okay. Close

1214
04:55:43,459 --> 04:55:48,900
up of the nut and a timpani noise is heard. Squidward. No Barnacle Boy. Confront Squidward.

1215
04:55:48,900 --> 04:55:53,939
Listen. Big Nose. Points at Mermaid Man. That guy has been saving your butt since before you were

1216
04:55:53,939 --> 04:56:00,459
born. Don't you got a living legend discounts or something? Squidward. This is a restaurant,

1217
04:56:00,459 --> 04:56:04,619
not a lending library. What's wrong with this guy? Pokes Barnacle Boy. And are you calling

1218
04:56:04,619 --> 04:56:11,900
Big Nose? Pokes Barnacle Boy again. Big Nose. Both press noses against each other. Barnacle Boy

1219
04:56:11,900 --> 04:56:17,659
gets out a $5 bill from his hat and he throws it to Squidward. Barnacle Boy. Well, next time

1220
04:56:17,659 --> 04:56:24,619
danger threatens. Don't expect any help from us. Squidward. Grabs the bill. Sarcastically. I'm

1221
04:56:24,619 --> 04:56:32,310
shaken. Hey. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. SpongeBob. Slowly breaks through wall. Mermaid Man and

1222
04:56:32,310 --> 04:56:38,069
Barnacle Boy. Must get autograph. Stretch his arm to pull the pen from Tom's shirt pocket and

1223
04:56:38,069 --> 04:56:43,700
stretch his second arm to grab a paper from the window. Mermaid Man. If you wanna grow up strong

1224
04:56:43,700 --> 04:56:49,720
like me. Shows his fat belly. Shocking Barnacle Boy. You gotta leave room for seconds. Here comes

1225
04:56:49,720 --> 04:56:57,369
our waiter. SpongeBob. Runs while making a weird face. Autograph. Barnacle Boy. Holy sea cow. It's

1226
04:56:57,369 --> 04:57:05,779
that sponge kid. Mermaid Man. Quick lad. Pants falls down to the invisible boat mobile. Runs outside

1227
04:57:05,779 --> 04:57:13,610
while holding his pants away. Barnacle Boy. Where do we park? Mermaid Man. A SpongeBob. Can I have

1228
04:57:13,610 --> 04:57:19,479
your autograph? Can I have your autograph? Can I? They're gone. Gasps. Mermaid Man's belt.

1229
04:57:20,549 --> 04:57:26,549
Mermaid Man. Wait! We'll find it with the invisible boat alarm. He pulls it out and makes

1230
04:57:26,549 --> 04:57:31,029
his depressal button. Why was he acting there? A car flickers in and out of visibility. Thrives.

1231
04:57:31,029 --> 04:57:37,340
Making beeps as well. There she is. They run over and jump in the car. Barnacle Boy hits the seat

1232
04:57:37,340 --> 04:57:44,860
divider. Barnacle Boy. Wait! Rubs his behind. I told you we surely got the automatic. SpongeBob.

1233
04:57:44,860 --> 04:57:51,500
Hey guys. Wait up. Pulling out Mermaid Man's bell. Slow motion. I've got something for you.

1234
04:57:52,540 --> 04:58:00,490
Barnacle Boy. Both speed off in the boat. SpongeBob. You forgot your belt. You forgot.

1235
04:58:00,569 --> 04:58:04,409
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy drive away Mermaid Man's secret utility belt.

1236
04:58:05,349 --> 04:58:11,560
The emblem of submersible justice. For 65 years, this belt has helped prevent the fall of nations

1237
04:58:11,560 --> 04:58:18,330
and pants. I can't believe I'm actually holding it in my hands. Well, I guess I should return it.

1238
04:58:19,139 --> 04:58:23,380
Makes one step in the boat's direction then sprints back to the kitchen with the belt on or not.

1239
04:58:24,330 --> 04:58:28,409
Giggles. I could just hang onto till after work all alone with Mermaid Man's belt.

1240
04:58:29,259 --> 04:58:34,569
I wonder what this button does. Presses the belt and a pickle barrel shrinks. Whoa.

1241
04:58:35,500 --> 04:58:40,389
Grabs the shrunken barrel. The small ray. He giggles and smiles mischievously.

1242
04:58:40,950 --> 04:58:46,790
Squidward, here's your shake, sir. He starts to hand him the shake, but he starts making loud

1243
04:58:46,790 --> 04:58:50,869
noise from the kitchen and SpongeBob's giggle, causing him to accidentally drop the shake on

1244
04:58:50,869 --> 04:58:57,110
the guy's head. The guy punches Squidward in the face and storms out. There are more flashes,

1245
04:58:57,110 --> 04:59:01,430
noises, and giggles from the kitchen. Squidward gets up and he holds his head.

1246
04:59:01,430 --> 04:59:06,759
GRR. SpongeBob hands a tiny Krabby Patty to a cockroach. There you go.

1247
04:59:07,959 --> 04:59:15,080
That's not even real. This is a fake episode. Squidward, SpongeBob, what's going on in here?

1248
04:59:16,840 --> 04:59:21,720
SpongeBob wears a tiny hat and holds a tiny spatula and the cockroach is eating a Krabby

1249
04:59:21,720 --> 04:59:27,080
Patty while sitting on the shrunken dining table. Why is everything all tiny? SpongeBob

1250
04:59:27,080 --> 04:59:32,680
turns the belt around to hide it from Squidward. I don't know. Squidward, what do you got there?

1251
04:59:33,639 --> 04:59:41,080
SpongeBob, nothing Squidward. No. Really? SpongeBob, nothing Squidward. You've got something?

1252
04:59:41,080 --> 04:59:46,659
All right. Let's see it. Krabby Patty grabs SpongeBob and sees Mermaid Man's belt.

1253
04:59:46,659 --> 04:59:53,220
What the hell did I just get? SpongeBob, no. No. Squidward gasps. Is that Mermaid Man's belt?

1254
04:59:54,169 --> 05:00:02,069
SpongeBob, yes Squidward. Wow. I can't believe he'd lend it to you. SpongeBob, me, I either.

1255
05:00:02,069 --> 05:00:09,959
Chuckles nervously. Squidward gasps. He didn't lend it to you, did he? SpongeBob, please don't tell.

1256
05:00:10,599 --> 05:00:18,680
Squidward, angry. You stoned. SpongeBob, please don't tell. Squidward, oh, I'm telling.

1257
05:00:18,680 --> 05:00:25,290
SpongeBob, Squidward, if Mermaid Man finds out, he'll kick me out of his fan club for sure.

1258
05:00:25,290 --> 05:00:31,560
Please don't tell. Squidward, uh-oh, points at the phone hanging on a kitchen wall. There's the

1259
05:00:31,560 --> 05:00:37,880
phone. SpongeBob, don't. Is the episode almost over? Squidward, I'm walking towards the phone.

1260
05:00:37,880 --> 05:00:44,060
Slowly walks towards the phone. How long is this episode? SpongeBob, no. Squidward, slowly reaches

1261
05:00:44,060 --> 05:00:51,380
for the phone. I'm getting closer to the phone. SpongeBob, sobbing, do-oh-not. Squidward picks up

1262
05:00:51,380 --> 05:00:57,750
the phone, ready to call Mermaid Man. And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for. SpongeBob,

1263
05:00:57,750 --> 05:01:04,220
wails and tears himself. I'm begging you. Squidward, hello. I'd like to speak to Mermaid.

1264
05:01:04,220 --> 05:01:11,099
SpongeBob shrinks. Squidward, he lands on the table. What the? What? Phones hit Squidward on

1265
05:01:11,099 --> 05:01:18,779
the head. Ow. Mermaid Man on phone. Hello? Hello? Squidward, what did you do to me?

1266
05:01:19,900 --> 05:01:26,900
SpongeBob, I'm sorry, Squidward, but you made me do it. Squidward, SpongeBob, if you don't return

1267
05:01:26,900 --> 05:01:33,540
me to normal size right now, you're gonna be in really big trouble. SpongeBob, uh-huh, okay. Uh,

1268
05:01:34,650 --> 05:01:40,729
Squidward, I said no. SpongeBob, uh, belt is shown to have several complicated buttons. Uh,

1269
05:01:41,700 --> 05:01:46,419
Squidward, do you hear me? SpongeBob zaps Squidward and he appears with multiple eyes

1270
05:01:46,419 --> 05:01:52,009
with hissing snakes. Holy fish paste. Get it off me. Get it off me. I can't take it anymore.

1271
05:01:52,009 --> 05:01:57,860
Take size off him in pants and fear. Don't you know how to work that thing? SpongeBob, uh,

1272
05:01:57,939 --> 05:02:03,060
I can do it. SpongeBob changes Squidward into a burning mess, then changes him to have an

1273
05:02:03,060 --> 05:02:08,889
enormous nose, then to have no skin, then cut in half by scissors. What? Then changed into more

1274
05:02:08,889 --> 05:02:15,770
things off screen while SpongeBob looks in fright. Squidward screams whenever SpongeBob changes him.

1275
05:02:15,770 --> 05:02:22,200
Squidward looks burnt after SpongeBob's failed attempts to revert him. Stop. I've got an idea.

1276
05:02:22,200 --> 05:02:30,119
You stopped my game. Let's call Mermaid Man and SpongeBob snatching Squidward. No. I can't let

1277
05:02:30,119 --> 05:02:36,020
you do that, but there must be someone else who can help. Someone smart and wise with years of

1278
05:02:36,020 --> 05:02:42,599
life experience. He runs to Patrick's house where Patrick is sleeping. Patrick. I can't do it anymore.

1279
05:02:42,599 --> 05:02:48,680
Okay. I'll do it like speed, like five. I can't hear it anymore. Let's, uh, Mike, take it. Take

1280
05:02:48,680 --> 05:02:53,959
us away, Mike. He runs to Patrick's house where Patrick is sleeping. Patrick, Patrick, Patrick,

1281
05:02:54,520 --> 05:03:00,919
Patrick wakes up due to surprise. Oh, hi, SpongeBob, SpongeBob, Patrick. I was at work and Mermaid Man

1282
05:03:00,919 --> 05:03:04,680
and Barnacle Boy came, and I got this belt. And look, chose Patrick, the shrunken Squidward.

1283
05:03:05,240 --> 05:03:10,520
Patrick, a Squidward action figure. Grab Squidward, let me play with him. SpongeBob, no. Just give me

1284
05:03:10,520 --> 05:03:15,700
the ones in the corner. Imitates jet plane diving, machine gunfire, and explosion noises dive bomb.

1285
05:03:15,700 --> 05:03:19,700
SpongeBob, Patrick, Patrick, about to punch Squidward, and then comes a giant fist.

1286
05:03:19,700 --> 05:03:24,500
SpongeBob, Patrick, no, that's not an action figure. That's the real Squidward. I shrunk him by

1287
05:03:24,500 --> 05:03:28,860
accident. Patrick, oh, about to punch Squidward anyway, and then comes a giant Squidward screams.

1288
05:03:28,860 --> 05:03:32,860
SpongeBob stops Patrick. Wait, you don't understand. This is serious. I don't know how to

1289
05:03:32,860 --> 05:03:37,080
unshrink him. Slow it. I could be stuck like this for the rest of his life. Patrick, oh, don't worry

1290
05:03:37,080 --> 05:03:42,680
about it. He'll find love one day. SpongeBob, you think so? There's no comedic timing, but it'll be

1291
05:03:42,680 --> 05:03:48,009
with someone his own size. Pulls out a pickle like this pickle. See, they like each other. Squidward,

1292
05:03:48,009 --> 05:03:52,790
and then Patrick bangs them together as it's a kiss. Squidward is disgusted. SpongeBob, oh,

1293
05:03:52,790 --> 05:03:57,209
if only I knew how to work this thing. Patrick, let me take a look at it. HMM, you know what the

1294
05:03:57,209 --> 05:04:00,650
problem is? I'm not going to be able to get this done. Patrick, you got to set the points to the

1295
05:04:00,650 --> 05:04:04,490
M.M. formula when it should be set to turns M around W. I'm going to have to. I got to play

1296
05:04:04,490 --> 05:04:08,790
the game. I don't think wumbo is a real word. Patrick, come on. You know I wumbo, you wumbo,

1297
05:04:08,790 --> 05:04:13,110
the cheaply wumbo. Wumbo, wumboing, we'll have the wumbo, wumbo-rumbo-wumbology, the study of

1298
05:04:13,110 --> 05:04:17,450
wumbo. It's first grade, SpongeBob. Squidward, while Patrick is saying we'll have the wumbo,

1299
05:04:17,450 --> 05:04:21,270
I wonder if the fall from this height could be enough to kill me. SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm sorry,

1300
05:04:21,270 --> 05:04:26,549
I doubted you. Patrick, well, all right, then. Let her rip. SpongeBob uses Mermaid Man's belt and

1301
05:04:26,549 --> 05:04:29,990
presses something to try and regrow Squidward. Only Patrick and Squidward are both shrunk,

1302
05:04:29,990 --> 05:04:35,240
now it worked. SpongeBob, oh no. Patrick, look, SpongeBob's giant. SpongeBob grabs them,

1303
05:04:35,240 --> 05:04:40,599
can I be giant next? SpongeBob, Patrick, I'm not giant, you shrunk too. Patrick, you're kidding.

1304
05:04:40,599 --> 05:04:44,939
Pulls out his pickle, good thing I still got his pickle. Kisses the pickle three times. Pan over

1305
05:04:44,939 --> 05:04:50,330
to Squidward. Squidward, they. Now will you take us to Mermaid Man? SpongeBob yells in Squidward's

1306
05:04:50,330 --> 05:04:55,270
face, no. He can never find out, but I'll think of something. I promise. Gets a jar and puts them

1307
05:04:55,270 --> 05:04:59,590
in until then. You'll be safe in this jar. Patrick, you know what's funny? My pickle started out in a

1308
05:04:59,590 --> 05:05:05,590
jar and now it's in one again. They. It's like a pun or something. SpongeBob, it's only two people,

1309
05:05:05,590 --> 05:05:09,590
no big deal. Somebody said this is giving me a stomach ache. Sandy suddenly appears. Sandy, hi,

1310
05:05:09,590 --> 05:05:14,790
SpongeBob. SpongeBob screams Sandy. Shrinks Sandy. Sandy lands on the ground. What did you four

1311
05:05:14,790 --> 05:05:19,110
crying out? What did you all do to me? SpongeBob, I'm sorry, Sandy. Mermaid Man came in and Larry

1312
05:05:19,110 --> 05:05:24,979
appears. God damn it, why? They. SpongeBob shrinks Larry. Nat, they. SpongeBob, I shrinks Nat.

1313
05:05:24,979 --> 05:05:29,669
Nancy Susie Fish. Hi, SpongeBob. Shrinks Nancy. SpongeBob screams and makes a run for it.

1314
05:05:29,669 --> 05:05:34,069
What is this? It's coming out of the. SpongeBob shrinks Mrs. Puff. It's out of the machine.

1315
05:05:34,069 --> 05:05:39,189
Shrinks Scooter, Sandals and Dennis. Fish number one. They. SpongeBob. This shit's out of the machine.

1316
05:05:39,189 --> 05:05:44,810
Fish number two. SpongeBob. Hi. Shrinks Fish. Fish number three. They. SpongeBob. Shrinks Fish.

1317
05:05:44,810 --> 05:05:49,369
Fish number four. What's up? Sponge. Shrinks Fish. SpongeBob tries to fit everyone in the jar,

1318
05:05:49,369 --> 05:05:54,169
Wu. I'm going to have to get a bigger jar. Squidward, SpongeBob, will you just face facts?

1319
05:05:55,220 --> 05:05:59,319
I think it's almost done. You've got to go to Mermaid Man. SpongeBob. Oh, Squidward,

1320
05:05:59,319 --> 05:06:03,959
he'll be so disappointed. Sandy, well, you can't leave us small forever. SpongeBob, you don't

1321
05:06:03,959 --> 05:06:07,900
understand. SpongeBob's mother is seen in the jar. Mrs. Squarepants. What do you mean it's not?

1322
05:06:07,900 --> 05:06:12,139
It's about halfway. You need to admit your mistakes. I'm not at halfway. SpongeBob. Mom.

1323
05:06:12,139 --> 05:06:17,029
Mermaid Man, your mother's right, son. Mermaid Man will understand. Barnacle Boy, you're Mermaid Man,

1324
05:06:17,029 --> 05:06:21,909
you old coot. Mermaid Man. Oh, yes, SpongeBob. Mermaid Man, I'm so sorry. It's just that I'm

1325
05:06:21,909 --> 05:06:26,330
such a big fan. And your belt. And Mermaid Man, comforting SpongeBob. Oh, don't worry, son.

1326
05:06:27,049 --> 05:06:30,490
I understand. SpongeBob smiles, with tears still pooling in his eyes. Why? I remember back when I

1327
05:06:30,490 --> 05:06:34,650
first used the belt. The year was 19, not 11, 12. Why I believe the president. Everyone, just tell

1328
05:06:34,650 --> 05:06:41,290
him how to unshrink us. I need to have a different person doing this. They're all freaking me out.

1329
05:06:41,290 --> 05:06:50,069
Let's have Rachel come in. Everyone, just tell him how to unshrink us. Mermaid Man. Oh, yes,

1330
05:06:50,069 --> 05:06:57,319
the unshrinked ray. Let's see. Did you set it to one bow? Everyone, what? The jar rumbles from anger,

1331
05:06:57,319 --> 05:07:02,779
and everyone flies out of their jar, spells out and form Get SpongeBob. Get SpongeBob. Climbs up

1332
05:07:02,779 --> 05:07:07,740
SpongeBob's body and into the holes in his head. Squidward, now I have to drive five miles to go

1333
05:07:07,740 --> 05:07:12,939
to the bathroom in my own home. What? Kicks SpongeBob's stomach. Sandy, and I need an elevator

1334
05:07:12,939 --> 05:07:18,779
to climb one stair. Why does he keep doing this? Punches his brain. Mermaid Man, we've been shrinking

1335
05:07:18,779 --> 05:07:25,740
for years. Barnacle Boy, but this is ridiculous. Both kick his eyeballs. Dale kicks his pelvis.

1336
05:07:25,819 --> 05:07:30,869
Nancy chops off one of his lungs while hanging onto his spine. Larry kicks his knee. SpongeBob

1337
05:07:30,869 --> 05:07:36,900
is shown getting hurt from the outside. Everyone, everything's too big. SpongeBob, I've got it.

1338
05:07:36,900 --> 05:07:41,139
Squidward soars a blood vein and Frank tries to break a bone, but stop when SpongeBob shrinks

1339
05:07:41,139 --> 05:07:46,119
the city. Tarder. Everyone looks outside through his holes. Since I couldn't make you big, I made

1340
05:07:46,119 --> 05:07:52,709
the city small. Everybody leaves SpongeBob's body, and now only one more thing to shrink. Cheese.

1341
05:07:52,709 --> 05:07:57,560
Turns the shrink ray into W and towards him like a camera and shrinks himself. Squidward,

1342
05:07:57,560 --> 05:08:04,099
I guess this is okay. Larry, yeah, what's the difference? Nancy, good idea. SpongeBob,

1343
05:08:04,099 --> 05:08:08,580
everyone cheers. Balloons and other party items are flying. As a bus comes back and Plankton gets off

1344
05:08:08,580 --> 05:08:12,810
of it. It is a classic, you're right. Plankton, well, it's great to be back. Really, it's great

1345
05:08:12,810 --> 05:08:35,259
to be back, SpongeBob. That's the whole episode? That's it. Okay, it hasn't been 22 minutes though.

1346
05:08:35,259 --> 05:08:45,159
Hey, you guys want to watch more TV? Because I'm only at 30,000. Oh, that's right, SpongeBob

1347
05:08:45,159 --> 05:08:53,930
episodes are 11 minutes long. No, I'm not, we don't have to do any more SpongeBob transcripts.

1348
05:08:59,430 --> 05:09:11,139
No, no, I, we just did that for like seven straight minutes. What the fuck is that? This is,

1349
05:09:16,040 --> 05:09:31,639
really? I can't, this actually exists? All right, I'll put this one on. I gotta replace this. Hold

1350
05:09:31,639 --> 05:09:53,509
on. Okay, let's do, um, Rod. Okay, Rod, let's hear it. Rats, rats, we're rats, we're the rats.

1351
05:09:54,500 --> 05:10:00,759
We pray at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats. Giant rat, I'm da giant rat that makes all

1352
05:10:00,759 --> 05:10:08,139
of da rules. Rats, let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into. Dick, so sue me for

1353
05:10:08,139 --> 05:10:14,150
being thorough, I wanna know that you know what the plan is. Trenchcoat man, look, seriously,

1354
05:10:14,150 --> 05:10:19,979
mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs? Dick, well,

1355
05:10:19,979 --> 05:10:24,139
I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're gonna get the treasure, we're gonna get out

1356
05:10:24,139 --> 05:10:31,180
of there and we're all stars mumbling. Blue man, who ha ha. Dick, and we must get it. That's the

1357
05:10:31,180 --> 05:10:38,139
most important thing. So beyond your game, we go now. Blue man, I get to drive the car today

1358
05:10:38,139 --> 05:10:42,939
because it's my birthday. Dick, no, don't let him get in the car, please don't let.

1359
05:10:43,990 --> 05:10:50,950
Blue man, quietly, come on. Dick, oh, he's driving, whatever. I can't, put it down. Bloody hell.

1360
05:10:51,830 --> 05:10:55,189
It's trying to get out. More importantly, it's trying to get out. Did we have a rat problem?

1361
05:10:56,169 --> 05:11:02,869
Dick, we don't. Get in. Let's go, speed it up. Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's

1362
05:11:02,869 --> 05:11:09,509
the kind of fastness I want. Asterisk cuts to the town asterisk. Dick, I don't even know where you're

1363
05:11:09,509 --> 05:11:16,119
going at this point. We've been driving all night. Blue man, it's my birthday. Dick, hey you, you just

1364
05:11:16,119 --> 05:11:22,970
you're running over a guy right now. He's fucking serious. Trench cold man, can you remind me next

1365
05:11:22,970 --> 05:11:29,049
time we do this? I'm getting my nan to drive. Asterisk camera cuts inside of a cafe shop asterisk.

1366
05:11:30,139 --> 05:11:35,659
Clerk, um, excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over there dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this

1367
05:11:35,659 --> 05:11:40,779
building. So you're going to have to give me, we're all going to die. Dick, ladies and gentlemen of

1368
05:11:40,779 --> 05:11:46,380
the jury, may I have the attention of the class? My name is Dick Dastardly, Richard, and I'm here

1369
05:11:46,380 --> 05:11:52,619
to take the treasure chest that's in the back room. Go get it, boys. I'll follow you in. And let me

1370
05:11:52,619 --> 05:11:56,939
tell you something, clerk. If you so ask, move it muscle. I'll make sure you stay buried in that

1371
05:11:56,939 --> 05:12:02,939
ground there. All right, let's go. Dick goes into the Mayan temple. The golden statue comes alive

1372
05:12:02,939 --> 05:12:09,020
and follows him. Dick, all right. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Is the treasure in there?

1373
05:12:09,979 --> 05:12:18,060
Is it in there? Trench cold man? Yeah, it's all here. Dick? Oh, yes. No, that's what I like to hear.

1374
05:12:19,029 --> 05:12:25,189
And now we are invincible. Gerard? Not so fast. Gerard? You stand before Gerard, guardian of the

1375
05:12:25,189 --> 05:12:30,709
treasure chest of the Mayan temple, and they will make sure to hey. Giant rat picks him up and throws

1376
05:12:30,709 --> 05:12:37,830
him into the abyss. Trench cold man? Oh, fuck this. I'm off. Gerard? Hey, what are you doing?

1377
05:12:38,790 --> 05:12:45,990
Rats? We're the rats. We pray at night. We stalk at night. We're the rats. Dick? All right. Yay.

1378
05:12:45,990 --> 05:12:50,950
That's cool. Yeah. I like rats. Nothing bad with rats. But let me tell you something. Over my dead

1379
05:12:50,950 --> 05:12:59,189
body. Are you getting this treasure? Rats? Rats? Rats? Rats? Rats? Blue man? Oh, man. Look at that

1380
05:12:59,189 --> 05:13:04,389
flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie. The movie. That's your favorite

1381
05:13:04,389 --> 05:13:10,229
movie too, right? Giant rat? No, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay,

1382
05:13:10,229 --> 05:13:15,750
now I kill you, kick. Got it. Blue man? Wow. No, that's great pick choice for favoriteist movie.

1383
05:13:15,750 --> 05:13:21,590
I wonder if I have to think that now. Small slash giant rat. Now I get to be the giant rat. Cool

1384
05:13:21,590 --> 05:13:28,389
surprise. Camera moves back to the town where the police have arrived. Police officer. So you're

1385
05:13:28,389 --> 05:13:32,709
trying to tell me that inside this building right here, there is a giant rat. Among other things,

1386
05:13:33,669 --> 05:13:40,069
did he say Pickles? Or am I putting that in there by myself? Whatever. Sergeant Pickles is

1387
05:13:40,069 --> 05:13:43,750
going to go in there and check it out. We're going to make sure everything's okay. And I'll get me

1388
05:13:43,750 --> 05:13:49,259
some candy corn too. That's a weird request. I know, but just get it. Camera cuts back into the

1389
05:13:49,259 --> 05:13:54,680
cafe shop. Giant rat. You guys are going to drop it and we're going to be in big trouble. So quit

1390
05:13:54,680 --> 05:14:03,000
prancing around. Yes, it does. Hello, sir. Welcome to the rat cafe. There's no rats here. There's

1391
05:14:03,000 --> 05:14:08,680
just the hamburgers. Police officer too. Yeah, that would be real nice if that were true. That's

1392
05:14:08,680 --> 05:14:14,200
it. Two sixty. You're a rat, aren't you? Giant rat. No, no, why would that happen? That's not

1393
05:14:14,200 --> 05:14:19,240
we're just, we're just people. Police officer too. Man, I'm going to be taking you in then.

1394
05:14:20,200 --> 05:14:25,959
Jerma, you know, wouldn't this be funny if it were real? Haha, just kidding. Be careful. Apparently

1395
05:14:25,959 --> 05:14:32,360
there's a giant rat around. Giant rat. You have a good day, officer. Officer leaves and camera

1396
05:14:32,360 --> 05:14:39,959
falls to the town. Police officer. So, you figure anything out in there? Police officer too. Nah,

1397
05:14:39,959 --> 05:14:46,680
he's clean. It's back to the drawing board. Police officer. Well, that's, that's great. I don't know

1398
05:14:46,680 --> 05:14:51,659
how to draw, so you're going to have to do the drawing. Cat police music starts and the cat police

1399
05:14:51,659 --> 05:14:58,619
arrive. Scratchy scratch. Sergeant Scratchy Scratch of the cat police reporting in. You are now

1400
05:14:58,619 --> 05:15:03,979
relived of your duty. Police officer one and two. Jerma is simultaneous or proving the cat

1401
05:15:03,979 --> 05:15:10,139
police. This is the kind of shit that happens when you have a text to speech enabled stream.

1402
05:15:10,139 --> 05:15:16,500
What's that on you? Police officer two. What? Scratchy scratch. Are you wearing a rat on your

1403
05:15:16,500 --> 05:15:24,419
shoulder? Police officer two. Why would I be wearing a... Hey guys, so, um. Yeah, so I have

1404
05:15:24,419 --> 05:15:29,139
some merch if you want to check out my store. Small rat. Boss, we got big problems. The cat

1405
05:15:29,139 --> 05:15:34,259
police are here. I gotta try to drop these balls into the... Can we try to drop these in here?

1406
05:15:34,259 --> 05:15:39,060
Let's get it. Get us the fuck out of here. Okay. Hey, you drive the car. You gotta get five in each

1407
05:15:39,060 --> 05:15:44,740
bucket. Let's speed it up. Because when you get five in a bucket, it's easier to get 500 tickets.

1408
05:15:44,740 --> 05:15:51,220
Rats. Inaudible screaming and yelling. Scratchy scratch. Good job, cat police. You did it again.

1409
05:15:51,220 --> 05:15:55,540
You saved the world and that's what we do as cat police. We make the world a better place.

1410
05:15:56,580 --> 05:16:00,740
Camera cuts to space where earth blows up in a ufo with a cat head is nearby.

1411
05:16:01,700 --> 05:16:08,659
Credits to Jerma985 for the video. Movie idea in all concepts. Script was typed up completely

1412
05:16:08,659 --> 05:16:17,619
by me with edits from the community. We really are getting an NPR outro. That's an NPR outro.

1413
05:16:17,619 --> 05:16:44,759
Is it over? Okay, it's over. How many tickets? 37,000 tickets. Let me just put these in.

1414
05:16:46,040 --> 05:16:51,099
This is less efficient than the... I had to get away from the co-op for a minute.

1415
05:16:59,000 --> 05:17:01,880
God. I'm doing this one at like times 10 speed.

1416
05:17:02,680 --> 05:17:15,750
This is no... Why would somebody do this? This one is actually going to be as fast as I can make it.

1417
05:17:21,560 --> 05:17:26,040
I'm not suffering through this for long. Rats. Rats. We're the rats. What? We pray at night.

1418
05:17:26,040 --> 05:17:29,479
We stalk at night. We're the rats. No, that's not... I'm that giant rat that makes all of the rules.

1419
05:17:30,040 --> 05:17:32,840
Rats. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into. That's not as close to being...

1420
05:17:32,840 --> 05:17:34,520
So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what the plan is.

1421
05:17:35,400 --> 05:17:55,639
Stop. Okay. You're not getting... I'm not going to slow this one down.

1422
05:17:56,520 --> 05:18:18,889
Here you go. You've reached the 20 minute daily limit for voices. Oh god damn it. That means I

1423
05:18:18,889 --> 05:18:25,130
have to do David. Hello ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to episode one of Jermacraft, the series

1424
05:18:25,130 --> 05:18:28,950
where I play Minecraft. This is going to be a single player let's play and when I say let's play,

1425
05:18:28,950 --> 05:18:31,669
I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game. You're gonna see lots of fails.

1426
05:18:32,549 --> 05:18:36,790
You're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of

1427
05:18:36,790 --> 05:18:41,189
coffee, hot cup of cocoa. I've got apple cider right here freshly brewed. Let me take a sip.

1428
05:18:42,150 --> 05:18:45,349
Sip off. That's good cider. All right, so let's get this started. Create new world.

1429
05:18:46,229 --> 05:18:51,349
World name is going to be Jermacraft. Sounds about right. Yeah okay. Game mode is going to be

1430
05:18:51,349 --> 05:18:55,669
Super AI Survival. That's the most interesting I think. More world option C for world generator.

1431
05:18:55,669 --> 05:18:59,509
Okay this is important. I got named as something crazy to get cool structures and stuff.

1436
05:19:17,779 --> 05:19:23,939
gonna end up? Okay what what? Where the hell am I? I spawned on top of a mountain top. Okay hold on.

1437
05:19:23,939 --> 05:19:28,340
Sound has to be lowered. Definitely. Okay a little bit of that. A little bit of that. Maybe a

1438
05:19:28,340 --> 05:19:34,180
little lower. That sounds about right. All right. So uh apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.

1439
05:19:34,180 --> 05:19:39,560
I kinda this is a good seed. What's that? We're going to explore it right now go. Dies from fall

1450
05:20:25,900 --> 05:20:31,189
we pointing east I have no idea gotta get some trees that's the most important part of Minecraft

1451
05:20:31,189 --> 05:20:35,270
you gotta get trees that's the first thing you gotta get let me take a sip of my apple cider

1452
05:20:36,229 --> 05:20:39,990
sipping sounds oh that's good stuff hopefully you guys picked up a thing of cocoa like I told

1453
05:20:39,990 --> 05:20:43,189
you to because that's the most relaxing thing in the world sitting down playing video games doesn't

1454
05:20:43,189 --> 05:20:48,709
get much better than that okay come on now oh we got sand too now explain this to me all right

1455
05:20:48,709 --> 05:20:52,950
is this an ai that created what personal email and explain to me why there are cows that are acting

1456
05:20:52,950 --> 05:20:57,909
like mountain lions I'm gonna kill each one of those cows in just a minute you watch all

1457
05:20:57,909 --> 05:21:00,950
damage how well at least there's one tree over here try to remember I gotta go back that way

1458
05:21:00,950 --> 05:21:05,270
because that's where the house is gonna be my awesome dirt house so if you are an old subscriber

1459
05:21:05,270 --> 05:21:09,909
I mean really old like at least four months ol on 44 or five months you'll remember the original

1460
05:21:09,909 --> 05:21:14,330
germacraft it was like two episodes and I built a dirt house this is gonna be completely different

1461
05:21:14,330 --> 05:21:16,970
I'm going to actually spend time and make some cool stuff at least that's what I'm pretending

1462
05:21:16,970 --> 05:21:22,090
that I'm gonna say that got some wood I got Gino still it's Minecraft skin from Mario RPG one of

1463
05:21:22,090 --> 05:21:27,450
the best games of all time if you have never played Mario RPG I suggest you play it all right

1464
05:21:27,450 --> 05:21:32,889
got some wood I need more trees over here I can dig up I'll get this one too excruciatingly slow

1465
05:21:32,889 --> 05:21:38,790
wood punching more wood punching so I guess they added a hunger feature now too if you're hungry

1466
05:21:38,790 --> 05:21:44,459
you die or something I guess who knows even more wood punching a little bit more wood and in my

1467
05:21:44,459 --> 05:21:47,419
live streams I was always a tradition that when I played this game I would sing a song when things

1468
05:21:47,419 --> 05:21:52,459
got really boring opportunity right now to sing a song so I'll let me just prep my vocal chords

1469
05:21:52,459 --> 05:21:56,700
for a second six apple cider clears throat okay so we're getting wood right now right

1479
05:23:01,959 --> 05:23:06,819
dirt down here make sure I can you know D did I really run out of dirt wonderful my first wooden

1480
05:23:06,819 --> 05:23:11,450
tools it's just like going to your first day of school and get punched in the face by the bully

1481
05:23:11,450 --> 05:23:15,450
what speaking of bullies I got a funny story for you first ever story on German crap

1482
05:23:16,409 --> 05:23:20,409
while I do this mundane stuff so when I was like in the fourth grade I was a kid that lived down

1483
05:23:20,409 --> 05:23:24,409
the street from me his name will stay anonymous because you know I don't want him to like if he

1484
05:23:24,409 --> 05:23:28,580
watches these videos I don't want him to come like feed me up not that he would ever remember

1485
05:23:28,580 --> 05:23:32,330
this to begin with but I was probably like the fourth grade and it swallows I was a little s

1486
05:23:32,330 --> 05:23:35,900
word guys I was a little I was a little little jerk when I was younger so essentially what

1487
05:23:35,900 --> 05:23:41,560
happened was this kid he was a big big fat kid scary not very nice and my brother got in like

1488
05:23:41,560 --> 05:23:44,360
a fight with him like a little time before this V when I was like the second grade my brother's

1489
05:23:44,360 --> 05:23:48,310
a little bit older than me and let me pick this up so my brother got in a fight with this kid and

1490
05:23:48,310 --> 05:23:52,439
like I heard about it and so at the bus stop one day because we were at the same bus stop because

1491
05:23:52,439 --> 05:23:56,680
he lives right down the street from us at least at least he did I don't know if he does anymore

1492
05:23:56,680 --> 05:24:01,189
so I'd know why I was in the fourth grade this so much of a little jerk I was so my grandmother

1493
05:24:01,189 --> 05:24:05,259
used to pick me up from school after I got from the bus stop because you know obviously you don't

1494
05:24:05,259 --> 05:24:08,220
want to walk you know the mile and a half back to your house or whatever it is mile cause the

1495
05:24:08,220 --> 05:24:12,709
bus stop wasn't that close so my grandma used to pick me up and he was at the bus stop as well

1496
05:24:12,709 --> 05:24:16,619
and one day I decided that out of the back window I was going to give him a double middle finger

1497
05:24:16,619 --> 05:24:20,540
as I was driving with my grandmother one day I'd know why I don't even know why I did it guys I

1498
05:24:20,540 --> 05:24:24,700
can't I can't tell you one reason why I gave this kid double middle finger this is a real story

1499
05:24:24,700 --> 05:24:29,479
he just kind of gave me the w like a weird look like what I did I actually did this and from that

1500
05:24:29,479 --> 05:24:33,779
day forward I would run run as fast as I could to the bus stop and wait to the bus stop where

1501
05:24:33,779 --> 05:24:37,779
my grandmother was gonna pick me up and it was like that for almost six months yeah and he never

1502
05:24:37,779 --> 05:24:42,569
beat me up or anything like that he and he I don't I don't I was like overreacting actually

1503
05:24:42,569 --> 05:24:47,290
hold on a second I don't need this what am I doing with this I was just putting blocks down

1504
05:24:47,290 --> 05:24:51,770
actually no no no I was I was doing the right thing I want I want these cause I want to make

1505
05:24:51,770 --> 05:24:56,790
like a wall kind of let's keep that going so yeah so I guess the moral of the story is never give

1506
05:24:56,790 --> 05:24:59,349
a double middle finger to a bully dot cause you'll be scared for the rest of your life

1507
05:25:00,380 --> 05:25:03,900
and I still am scared when I like open my doors to like go and get the groceries I'm scared

1508
05:25:03,900 --> 05:25:08,459
that bully's gonna come get me for me giving him the bird yeah that is actually a true story

1509
05:25:08,459 --> 05:25:12,279
I did not make that up it I was scared for like at least six months and nothing ever

1510
05:25:12,279 --> 05:25:16,900
happened either and like like I didn't get beat up or anything so all right now is there is this

1511
05:25:16,900 --> 05:25:29,900
all is this going to be down in okay cool we finally give drugs to robots in this game when

1512
05:25:29,900 --> 05:25:34,840
people are watching I really don't think it's happened ambient cave sound is that oh there's

1513
05:25:34,840 --> 05:25:41,049
a light somewhere around here oh geez it's right here oh nice maybe there's coal right here too

1514
05:25:41,049 --> 05:25:44,470
that'd be pretty awesome I was good for at least six months I was scared for six months you know

1515
05:25:44,470 --> 05:25:49,139
for six months I'm gonna kick your butt I can't get that low up go on go on what do you think I

1567
05:34:19,860 --> 05:34:26,569

1568
05:34:26,569 --> 05:34:33,110

1569
05:34:33,110 --> 05:34:38,150
to happen in my life.the cat pukes as I get right up to the cat I'm about to save the cat stuck in

1570
05:34:38,150 --> 05:34:47,450
the tree and the cat throws up right in my face and it's all like what oh but I still had to hold

1571
05:34:47,450 --> 05:34:54,169
onto the tree.so as I'm holding onto the tree I almost lose grip like twice but thank god I

1572
05:34:54,169 --> 05:35:04,069
had those swim mice yeah know what I'm saying like lol I finally get up right to the perch

1573
05:35:04,069 --> 05:35:09,270
and I have to wipe off the cat puke on my face and I go back on top and I'm sitting.the cat has

1574
05:35:09,270 --> 05:35:15,299
moved over to the end of the branch by now so by the time the cat is sitting on the end of the

1575
05:35:15,299 --> 05:35:22,279
branch I'm like please don't do that I'm trying my hardest to save you a bird lands right on where

1576
05:35:22,279 --> 05:35:31,209
the cat is so the cat has now got his attention on the bird so honest to god it was unbelievable

1577
05:35:31,209 --> 05:35:37,419
so you've got a cat sitting on the itch and you got the bird sitting there and the cat now has

1578
05:35:37,419 --> 05:35:43,770
the attention on the bird so the bird is skvocking at the cat at this point and then they're moving

1579
05:35:43,770 --> 05:35:50,500
the branch back and forth and I'm like shaking on the branch like holy shit dude like the branch

1582
05:36:04,299 --> 05:36:11,189

do the Peter Griffin TTS no I don't want Peter Griffin text-to-speech guys you know how much

1629
05:46:07,290 --> 05:46:15,479
that would cost on fiber that would be like 500 bucks that wouldn't just be five dollars it's

1630
05:46:15,479 --> 05:46:32,409
five dollars for like fucking three like five seconds it's worth it okay I'll see what I can do

1631
05:46:32,409 --> 05:46:53,240
I'll see what I can do I keep sinking it right in the 18 all right how many do I have 40,000 how

1632
05:46:53,240 --> 05:47:03,340

1635
05:47:44,200 --> 05:47:50,139

1636
05:47:50,139 --> 05:47:54,779
fiber yeah I know it wasn't five dollars it would be at least one to two maybe even 300 bucks

1637
05:47:55,659 --> 05:48:16,009
to get them to read something that's that long why is this all fucked up oh

1639
05:48:27,139 --> 05:48:39,740

1654
05:52:48,709 --> 05:52:54,069

1655
05:52:54,069 --> 05:53:02,150
five times two three times everybody calls me stupid idiot dumb moron so I'm letting you guys

1656

1660
05:54:39,450 --> 05:54:53,430

1661
05:54:53,430 --> 05:55:07,419
on the one on the that was very clear I did it twice 20 times three is so important here

1662
05:55:07,419 --> 05:55:19,799
because that will probably be like 20 000 tickets holy shit everybody wants to go right in the middle

1663
05:55:19,799 --> 05:55:25,959
is that right in the middle well it looks kind of split it's definitely the top in the middle

1664
05:55:25,959 --> 05:55:54,060
area is that in the right spot 15 not bad not bad guys there's no more fives and we're good

1665
05:55:54,060 --> 05:56:24,869
there's no more fives oh 32 versus 49 down the middle this is that shitty suitcase deal show

1666
05:56:24,869 --> 05:56:35,930
oh yeah do or don't all right we're going right in the middle underneath 15

1667
05:56:43,540 --> 05:56:55,000
god damn it guys it's times two this shit's times two

1668
05:57:16,790 --> 05:57:21,610
cards are dropping though all right hold on a minute cards are dropping

1669
05:57:21,610 --> 05:57:39,209
I wonder if those are worth anything we don't deserve to lose okay hold on uh cards have been

1670
05:57:39,209 --> 05:57:56,549
dropping so hold on we lost because of your shitty computer that's not fair all right let me see

1671
05:57:56,549 --> 05:58:06,150
let me collect the uh the stuff my shitty computer and what if it was your computer that did it

1672
05:58:09,080 --> 05:58:32,090
we can do that again not one of these is lit up give me the fucking dunks I'm gonna pick

oh pretty trigger that bonus come on pretty great there's another one there's a seven

1679
06:00:20,900 --> 06:00:37,700
so what just fell out what was that what does it do stuff up this right side is it tickets

1680
06:00:57,479 --> 06:01:01,319
it's probably tickets okay there it goes down then it just disappears

1681
06:01:02,540 --> 06:01:04,860
is it just turn maybe it's just turning into the tickets

1682
06:01:07,580 --> 06:01:12,439
1300 61 all right we gotta get we gotta get the d

1684
06:01:42,979 --> 06:01:48,900
to take 22 minutes but I got too distracted by the spongebob episodes transcript and it derailed

1685
06:01:48,900 --> 06:02:05,479
the whole spring let me just try to get the bonus one more time if you get 20 spins at times three

1686
06:02:05,479 --> 06:02:16,419
that's like 10 000 tickets or even 15 at times three still haven't gone to the ufo arcade

1687
06:02:17,299 --> 06:02:21,479

1688
06:02:23,500 --> 06:02:49,259

1706
06:06:54,439 --> 06:07:03,290
all right almost at 50% that's so bad what can I get what's the

1707
06:07:18,490 --> 06:07:37,139

1714
06:09:49,349 --> 06:09:53,509
just turn your monitor off so you don't have to turn your monitor off and turn your sound

1715
06:09:53,509 --> 06:10:31,619
off until you don't have to listen to this okay got it fuck give me the k

1716
06:10:38,549 --> 06:10:48,040
around oh my god I missed it it's okay get another hundo I actually think this is pretty

1717
06:10:48,680 --> 06:10:55,479
efficient because eventually you'll get to a thousand you know I'm saying like I'm getting

1718
06:10:55,479 --> 06:11:01,400
500 800 400 500 every time and I and I'm then you will get 2000 if you sit here long enough

1719
06:11:05,819 --> 06:11:15,180
I fuck it up every damn time the ball claw machine is the best I sat there for like

1720
06:11:15,180 --> 06:11:19,979
40 minutes I need to do another a different game that's not the balloons

1721
06:11:26,310 --> 06:11:31,669
it is really loud I know it is oh my god I fucking missed it again

1722
06:11:32,310 --> 06:11:55,509
just put some shit in there the chicken again I don't know what it is about this k

1723
06:11:55,509 --> 06:12:00,389
but I can't not fucking get it it's pissing me off more than anything

1724
06:12:10,389 --> 06:12:16,180
America runs on dunco yes it does

1725
06:12:16,979 --> 06:12:42,840
okay 500 right here 500 oh I'll get it just teleported it was bullshit just teleported

1726
06:12:44,520 --> 06:12:57,860
all right I'll take the 2120 let's go cashman that's I think that's a solid like five eight

1727
06:12:57,860 --> 06:13:11,779
percent we're at 50% I'm just gonna now I'm gonna do the boring ball game no I'm not I'm gonna do

1728
06:13:11,779 --> 06:13:29,659
this do this until I don't do it got it oh I was I actually really did get it

1729
06:13:38,299 --> 06:13:49,220
I really I did I really did I think she looks like iPods in these it's gonna be close

1730
06:13:58,599 --> 06:14:02,279
this one's also way too expensive I don't want to do the money machine thing again

1731
06:14:09,610 --> 06:14:14,650
there it is all right that was perfect I refuse to play this again

1732
06:14:15,450 --> 06:14:24,310
oh I tried to get out but it I did the screen didn't even pop up for me

1733
06:14:46,459 --> 06:15:03,959
all right here we go here I am let's go figure out the ticket balls this one's broken it used

1734
06:15:03,959 --> 06:15:22,729
to work really well I need to get 100 500 balls do you understand the thing that you are telling

1735
06:15:22,729 --> 06:15:50,259
me that I need to do and how I don't want to do it stop spinning around so much no spongebob

1736
06:15:50,819 --> 06:15:56,200
no there's only a certain amount of spongebob that I'm allowed to take

1737
06:15:58,540 --> 06:16:14,200
17-hour stream no I'll get there quicker than that I think dunko might be a better bet I really do

1738
06:16:15,720 --> 06:16:27,299
I just got an achievement for getting 50 000 tickets all right I'm gonna I'll get let's do this

1739
06:16:30,119 --> 06:16:53,369
20 more times yeah back to the claw and then sometimes the claw just doesn't work

1740
06:16:54,330 --> 06:17:08,939
oh I'm a chicken wheel that's a good idea too what was the minor prize for the blocks game again

1741
06:17:08,939 --> 06:17:25,909
was it a thousand it was wasn't it it was 100 oh that's not worth it go back to the water gun

1742
06:17:25,909 --> 06:17:43,000
game now the water gun game doesn't give uh it gives credits it doesn't give tickets what time

1743
06:17:43,000 --> 06:17:49,419
is it right now I've had like two streams or three streams restart because of the internet being

1744
06:17:49,419 --> 06:17:56,299
weird earlier this is four and a half hours then two hours how long has this stream actually been

1745
06:18:01,779 --> 06:18:05,459
that's next level play right there and it didn't even go in it just teleported back to the

1746
06:18:06,659 --> 06:18:21,080
that's absolute dog shit it's been about seven hours well it's kept my attention for seven

1747
06:18:21,080 --> 06:18:26,790
hours somehow I don't know it's just like fun to do these things all right let me go and check

1748
06:18:26,790 --> 06:18:37,299
let's go I'm gonna go after one more ball and I'm gonna go to chicken game there we go come on get

1749
06:18:37,299 --> 06:18:47,659
it in there does that even is it counting I don't think that's fucking counting

1750
06:19:01,830 --> 06:19:17,639
almost there we're mostly there now don't you understand no that's just that's just cuckoo coins

1751
06:19:27,909 --> 06:19:40,409
bonus shot so if you do twice in a row you get 2,500 that's all the way up there is too hard

1752
06:19:54,740 --> 06:20:01,540
this one sucks it's fun to play but it's not it's bad it's not going to get us another 48,000 tokens

1753
06:20:01,540 --> 06:20:28,659
the 2,500 is 75 it's definitely 25 what we'll just go for red how many times do I have to do

1754
06:20:28,659 --> 06:20:52,979
that if I just landed on red 500 times 500 more times the ball drop game is actually pretty good

1755
06:20:52,979 --> 06:21:07,060
it's pretty consistent too all right I'm gonna do this I'm not gonna do this again I'm not gonna

1756
06:21:07,060 --> 06:21:12,650
put everybody through this a second time I'm gonna get like three or four hundred more tickets from

1757
06:21:12,650 --> 06:21:23,930
this game there's always that chance that I get all right here we go this is the shot right here

1758
06:21:24,490 --> 06:21:31,430
I'll take a hundred it's all right that's about well I'm looking like two or three more of these

1759
06:21:38,540 --> 06:22:03,700
get it oh what that would have been 2,500 too much I would have had it too all right so let's play a

1760
06:22:03,700 --> 06:22:12,259
game called there's 42 4,300 people here right now right so what we're gonna do is some people

1761
06:22:12,340 --> 06:22:17,060

1762
06:22:18,419 --> 06:22:20,819

1884
06:49:13,979 --> 06:49:18,299
you know here here's the thing I'm never gonna have to play any of these ever again in the

1885
06:49:18,299 --> 06:49:24,520
arcade I am getting my total fill from these games that I will walk right by them I don't

1886
06:49:24,520 --> 06:49:34,779
have to go to the arcade again I've seen this machine in a dozen arcades I don't even need to

1887
06:49:34,779 --> 06:49:43,209
play it who fucking cares I already did it like 50 times and neither do you unless you want to

1888
06:49:43,209 --> 06:50:01,720
try to show me up yeah fucking retweet this video if you think that you could beat me

1890
06:50:26,200 --> 06:50:30,200
to I don't know I need that in the basket I'll get a thousand in the basket and win

1891
06:50:40,860 --> 06:50:43,049
basketball doesn't give tickets

1892
06:50:45,610 --> 06:50:47,909
this is absolutely

1893
06:50:59,669 --> 06:51:02,200
I'll settle for 100

1894
06:51:02,200 --> 06:51:03,400
uh

1895
06:51:12,229 --> 06:51:22,500
it's the worst machine in any arcade now riddle me this why are these machines always

1896
06:51:23,139 --> 06:51:29,529
full of people there is always somebody playing one of these there's just at least

1897
06:51:29,529 --> 06:51:32,409
five of them lined up and every single one of them has a person on it

1898
06:51:39,020 --> 06:51:43,900
low skill high reward no it's low skill low reward you get like 10 tickets every time and

1899
06:51:43,900 --> 06:51:54,389
it's like four bucks this is the worst machine in the art again I don't talk about companies

1900
06:52:14,979 --> 06:52:22,389
scared me I'm in my own world so much that this person scared the shit out of me

1901
06:52:23,110 --> 06:52:24,330
oh

1902
06:52:35,319 --> 06:52:43,959
no statistically speaking there's no way it's not gonna happen guys it's not

1903
06:52:47,720 --> 06:52:55,479
there's nothing to this besides land on one one percent of the whole wheel

1904
06:52:56,040 --> 06:53:08,340
if I don't get this you're gonna unsew what if I do get this

1905
06:53:11,049 --> 06:53:15,209
should I prices right this and try to get it on 1000 and do like a one tiny little spin

1906
06:53:18,729 --> 06:53:23,299
let's try this let's try doing the prices right technique

1907
06:53:41,770 --> 06:53:59,540
it's gonna work I'm gonna get there and then I'm going to farm 1000 tickets stop stop stop stop

1908
06:53:59,540 --> 06:54:59,900
stop it's so diabolical I love it I'll get there slowly but surely yeah what do you mean zero

1909
06:54:59,900 --> 06:55:41,259
tickets oh fuck it actually went over it come on man you have to go one space all right I

1910
06:55:41,259 --> 06:55:49,479
understand so you have to at least go over one square so as long as I get to the yeah it was

1911
06:55:49,479 --> 06:56:04,060
landing on the same one it was actually working then yeah make sure the tickets are actually

1912
06:56:04,060 --> 06:56:13,830
coming out give me the hundred hundred uh will it still count as a hundred if I go if I get on the

1913
06:56:13,830 --> 06:56:38,040
hundred no I don't think so let me at least hit it just so I can go to sleep oh come on evil fish

1914
06:56:38,040 --> 06:56:46,220
just gave five community subs thank you evil fish lots of community subs tonight big subs

1915
06:56:48,119 --> 06:57:08,069
it works it works I did it oh 100 tickets now can I do it again nope I can do it I can get

1916
06:57:08,069 --> 06:57:21,450
through those it actually would have worked all right now we know it works I gotta go a little

1917
06:57:21,450 --> 06:57:37,000
faster than that that actually did give me the four still all right it's coming up here right

1918
06:57:37,959 --> 06:57:46,500
what is it the next one when is it it's still less efficient than the ball drop no I know but

1919
06:57:46,500 --> 06:57:52,659
I just I have to I have to beat this I have to get a thousand to come out of the machine therefore

1920
06:57:52,659 --> 06:58:10,439
I can say that I completed it here it comes okay stop all right little pushes

1921
06:58:16,729 --> 06:58:23,080
somebody said if you land on a thousand and then do a full pull it'll land on a thousand

1922
06:58:24,180 --> 06:58:40,459
not well is that real so get to a thousand and then land do full speed

1923
06:58:45,020 --> 06:58:53,130
what do I have to lose you're right why do you read chat comments like a radio host

1924
06:58:55,880 --> 06:59:09,020
because that's what this is I'm how is this any different what this is this is a radio show

1925
06:59:10,490 --> 06:59:29,290
why would I not read the comments you want to look over and go

1926
06:59:35,990 --> 06:59:41,290
nice dude and that and that's what I deserve for fucking oh my god

1927
06:59:46,810 --> 07:00:34,040
that's a funny thing you said dude land on it organically come on back there again

1928
07:00:34,040 --> 07:00:52,619
do that one more time and then uh here it is all right okay all right fuck okay I

1929
07:00:53,020 --> 07:01:12,020
ha ha ha yeah you have to do it so light uh I'm gonna turn the audio off I'm gonna

1930
07:01:12,020 --> 07:01:25,590
people it's freaking me out I just pulled my headphones off because there's no way I can't

1931
07:01:25,590 --> 07:02:08,979
that what a sad person how much money is that old guy spent on the machine I don't know

1932
07:02:09,779 --> 07:02:31,459
at least $400 I'm just leaning back in the chair I pulled up a chair by this point

1933
07:02:31,459 --> 07:02:34,979
it's still ringing in my head yeah like this

1934
07:02:44,439 --> 07:03:02,200
I almost just accidentally pressed it a tenth of a percent harder almost there hey thank you

1935
07:03:02,200 --> 07:03:12,169
demons V for the five community subs thanks a lot my new sub sound thank you for the that's my new

1936
07:03:12,169 --> 07:03:23,369
community sub sound appreciate it hope you guys like it every time I get a community sub that

1937
07:03:23,369 --> 07:03:45,020
song will play all right I gotta be careful it's a sneaky way of asking the subs hey look at that

1938
07:03:49,529 --> 07:04:04,819
is it sneaky or is it just like completely and totally like just out there I'm not gonna make

1939
07:04:04,819 --> 07:04:23,529
that the sub sound no way this hurts so much to watch it won't be in a minute I promise

1940
07:04:25,099 --> 07:04:29,799
we're almost there it's almost done and then I'm gonna do I'm gonna get on a thousand I'm gonna

1941
07:04:29,799 --> 07:04:53,580
full blast it speaking of sub sounds are they actually basically dead kind of kind of all right

1942
07:04:53,580 --> 07:05:21,400
here we go what's happening okay ready two more of those I think you're freaking me out

1943
07:05:21,400 --> 07:05:59,380
no um there's no overshoot joke you're freaking me out stop freaking me out fuck yes a thousand

1944
07:05:59,380 --> 07:06:42,900
tickets all right so they said do a full blast from here you lied well what do you mean I held

1945
07:06:42,900 --> 07:07:05,209
it down I actually held it down I swear to god stop oh all right I'm out I was trying to get it

1946
07:07:05,209 --> 07:07:48,180
just trying to hit it one more time sometimes you gotta try oh where am I let's see 61 000 all right

1947
07:07:48,180 --> 07:08:29,900
back to this I want to let me hit this at least one more time I think that's pretty good

1948
07:08:31,349 --> 07:08:45,139
no no no it was it looked all right it's all right um uh the treasure game I'll try it it's

1949
07:08:45,139 --> 07:08:51,740
gonna that's I don't know how I don't understand how this works you joystick to move arm and knock

1950
07:08:51,740 --> 07:08:59,990
off coins don't touch the shovel so how what's I can't even read if there's a thousand tickets

1951
07:08:59,990 --> 07:09:37,340
if you get to what I've knocked all the uh all the shit off the sound yeah I'm gonna turn this boy

1952
07:09:37,340 --> 07:09:48,220
down this is obnoxious I'm still not getting it do you have to get all the coins knocked off

1953
07:09:48,860 --> 07:10:24,459
I still don't get it the coins have to go forward is that what it is the front doesn't count I

1954
07:10:24,459 --> 07:10:33,659
thought the front is the thing that counts does anybody get what the hell this is actually going

1955
07:10:33,659 --> 07:11:31,639
on here I mean damn man like how the fuck are you supposed to do this front doesn't count how did

1956
07:11:31,639 --> 07:12:03,209
I only get five coins oh now those are definitely counting go left and right starting in the middle

1957
07:12:03,209 --> 07:12:09,029
is a bad strategy you talk about just like sweep left and right let's try this let's try just

1958
07:12:09,029 --> 07:12:56,700
sweeping up here like going like this that's too thin um this this one's stupid that's what I was

1959
07:12:56,700 --> 07:13:08,180
thinking I was thinking going around like a swirl like this this probably is the way you're supposed

1960
07:13:08,180 --> 07:13:28,889
to do it just break the glass I need to I need to figure this out how the hell are you supposed to

1961
07:13:29,450 --> 07:14:01,209
try doing a square around the perimeter not a bad idea so far it's just hard to grab them all

1962
07:14:01,209 --> 07:14:11,619
especially because you keep um I really hope this is not in any arcades because I feel bad

1963
07:14:11,619 --> 07:14:48,380
for the company that made it because no one plays it no I just I do get the treasure off

1964
07:14:48,380 --> 07:15:04,409
I can't even go back far enough to get it I'm not done let me try let me try one more time

1965
07:15:04,409 --> 07:15:18,439
I'm just gonna go back and then forward with all like the big chunk parts like that okay

1966
07:15:19,240 --> 07:15:36,330
there's not enough time to do this I even knocked off all the treasure chests

1967
07:15:39,509 --> 07:15:54,889
what the fuck I'm off doing it this last one I'm gonna try like an undulating technique

1968
07:16:17,689 --> 07:17:04,470
that might actually work that might actually work what the fuck that was fucking perfect

1969
07:17:04,470 --> 07:17:36,310
oh all right that's a hundred how many do you need I'm gonna try that again oh yeah that was

1970
07:17:36,310 --> 07:17:43,659
that was why was it 50 tickets all right last this one's dumb who cares I don't need to get

1971
07:17:43,659 --> 07:18:08,729
the thousand thousand that's a pretty good push right there that was a lot pretty good push again

1972
07:18:08,729 --> 07:18:31,159
come on man what oh all right come on last one that's it I'm going right down the middle

1973
07:18:31,159 --> 07:18:33,880

2296
08:56:42,180 --> 08:56:47,459
college and these streams have helped out as i felt depressed i figured out what was bothering me

2297
08:56:48,259 --> 08:56:52,340
uh i had spent too much time away from writing and drawing but i'm back at it and happy again

09:08:48,730 --> 09:08:57,449
let's get them on the screen why not why not right these are going to get cut off unfortunately

2375
09:08:57,449 --> 09:09:01,690
because of and look look at how fast these are going and the first like two hours of them have

2376
09:09:01,690 --> 09:09:08,010
been caught up annoying because this has happened the last few streams uh somehow for some reason

2377
09:09:08,010 --> 09:09:15,220
and i don't know why this is new usually we drop a shitload of frames or the internet will cut will

2378
09:09:15,220 --> 09:09:23,379
turn off but what's been happening recently is this weird stream completely just disconnects 100

2379
09:09:23,379 --> 09:09:30,699
and i'm still on the internet that happened once tonight and this weird like going to zero and

2380
09:09:30,699 --> 09:09:37,989
coming back but like the internet's not completely off i feel like the second time was not even a

2381
09:09:37,989 --> 09:09:43,669
cox problem the first time i think was because the house's internet was off but the second time

2382
09:09:43,669 --> 09:09:50,099
i was still online i was talking in chat this is a new problem we're not dropping a shitload of

2383
09:09:50,180 --> 09:09:59,739
frames anymore the stream's just turning off which is arguably worse so they're scheduled to come and

2384
09:09:59,739 --> 09:10:05,910
do some maintenance here some real maintenance that has been planned for months apparently so

2385
09:10:05,910 --> 09:10:16,010
we'll see if that helps frames are still dropping yeah but looking over here there were 4,600 frames

2386
09:10:16,089 --> 09:10:22,980
dropped a 4,664 in almost seven and a half hours that's pretty normal even if you have

2387
09:10:23,940 --> 09:10:29,059
perfect internet you're always going to drop over the course of six to eight hours on a stream

2388
09:10:29,059 --> 09:10:38,150
you'll drop like at least two to four thousand frames it'll happen but thank you to all the

2389
09:10:38,150 --> 09:10:46,019
subs everybody that's resubbing continue to resub all the gift subs you keep this channel fucking

2391
09:10:53,379 --> 09:10:58,019

2392
09:10:59,059 --> 09:11:05,940
once i have a date for that i'm gonna be hyping it up like crazy at least a month in advance like

2393
09:11:05,940 --> 09:11:10,739
two or three weeks in advance at least you will know when that day is i'm gonna have a pinned

2394
09:11:10,739 --> 09:11:19,220
tweet about it i will have at least three or four streams over the course of a month where we talk

2395
09:11:19,220 --> 09:11:25,540
about it they i'll make sure it's on the discord as a pin message i'll make sure that it gets on

2396
09:11:25,540 --> 09:11:31,059
the reddit as a pinned message so you'll be able to find it there'll be a command that's right i'll

2397
09:11:31,059 --> 09:11:36,739
make a command for it i'm gonna make the i this this stream is gonna cost a lot of money and a

2398
09:11:36,739 --> 09:11:40,980
lot of people are gonna be working on this so i want to make sure as many people that want to see

2399
09:11:40,980 --> 09:11:47,220
it that want to have fun and enjoy it are here so i'm gonna make sure it's in every single avenue

2400
09:11:48,180 --> 09:12:02,419
but i will give those details when they come i don't want to talk it up like crazy until i

2401
09:12:02,419 --> 09:12:10,260
have a real date which should be i mean i have i literally i'm going tomorrow um i have a meeting

2402
09:12:10,260 --> 09:12:16,260
with uh the person that's producing the whole thing so i'm sure i'll have some more hard data

2403
09:12:16,260 --> 09:12:27,099
tomorrow as well we will continue to discuss it don't worry you will know uh one one two one one

2404
09:12:27,180 --> 09:12:31,019
one two e thanks in three bucks hey germa yesterday was my birthday do you eat ass

2405
09:12:31,739 --> 09:12:39,349
a happy birthday happy birthday one one one two thank you to demons v for the three dollars and

2406
09:12:39,349 --> 09:12:43,029
33 cents really appreciate when streamers don't yell i like to zone out a bit while i watch

2407
09:12:47,029 --> 09:13:00,839
i'm a yeller i'm a screamer i'm a noisemaker it happens sometimes hopefully you're not asleep

2408
09:13:03,000 --> 09:13:07,160
thank you yes is online for the five dollars i'm very drunk right now but thanks for showing my

2409
09:13:07,160 --> 09:13:12,040
green screen video when i remixed the shining i couldn't make this in time for the encore night

2410
09:13:12,040 --> 09:13:31,059
so i'm gonna send it through here so for the future green screen videos i think i'm gonna have

2411
09:13:31,059 --> 09:13:37,419
a system where because i know there's a lot of them that have still been made and people are

2412
09:13:37,419 --> 09:13:45,419
still using it and instead of um doing another night i don't think i'm gonna do another uh green

2413
09:13:45,500 --> 09:13:54,739
screen night so what would probably end up happening is i think maybe a channel in the

2414
09:13:54,739 --> 09:14:03,720
discord might be interesting to have uh just a spot for people to put videos and for anybody

2415
09:14:03,720 --> 09:14:08,199
to enjoy them and obviously that discord is moderated so you can't put up any like just

2416
09:14:09,319 --> 09:14:18,260
junk like just crap that's not appropriate you know it's not going to happen but because of how

2417
09:14:18,260 --> 09:14:26,540
many people uh continue to make green screen stuff it might be worth having some other avenue

2418
09:14:26,540 --> 09:14:30,459
like another playlist or something or another channel or something eventually

2419
09:14:31,900 --> 09:14:48,699
