1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,300
Where am I supposed to bring this guy? This is a gigantic base with people in it, how am I supposed to sneak him out?

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,539
Leave the base with the captive. Oh, the body can be hidden in a truck, and that makes sense.

3
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,660
Okay, well you stay put, I'll be back. I killed him.

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:36,469
I've been sitting here for at least a few minutes, trying to figure out what exactly this fucking guy is doing.

5
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:44,530
Is he wiping down this old rusty cabinet with his hands? Or is he looking for a stud?

6
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,609
What are you doing? Stop, stop it please. I had to do that, you had...

7
00:00:51,609 --> 00:01:08,230
Who was that? Oh he found me, he found me. He is trying to figure out how to shoot me right now.

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:17,230
Oh shit, did you guys see that? That fucking hat over there. I can't seem to hit it. How do I hit this fucking hat that's on the ground?

9
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:33,930
You guys are so stupid, you can't hit a fucking hat on the ground. Is that what you're seeing?

10
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:51,329
Who is flying by and dropping missiles on this place? Stop with the fucking bombs being hidden by this guy.

11
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,209
Are you kidding me? Are you guys kidding me right now?

12
00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:04,180
These people are all out of their minds. They keep coming in here, realizing where I am.

13
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,990
And then somebody throws a grenade into the room and they have to leave. And some of them actually die.

14
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:22,310
There he is, I found him. Oh wait, Jerry, did you just throw a grenade into the room?

15
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,500
Which one of you morons is going to throw the grenade? That's the question.

16
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:38,659
We got the whole troop in here. Who is going to be the trigger finger moron? That does it.

17
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:53,979
What's the hold up? I don't understand what the hold up is. Was it you? Was it you?

18
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:14,310
What's going on? He's pointing his gun over.

19
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,550
What happened over here? I heard an explosion of some sort.

20
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:33,449
Throw it. Throw the grenade. Here we go, it's my chance. Throw it.

21
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:44,259
Did you just throw one in here? Why would you walk in the room after you threw it? You threw it into the wall.

22
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:50,060
I can't stop playing in the grenade room. I've just been reloading this over and over again.

23
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,069
That guy didn't even attempt to get out of the way.

24
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:04,000
Something interesting. If you take a look at the minimap you see all the green blobs.

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Those are all the people, all the guards, all the hotel staff, all the people here cannot see through my disguise.

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,709
There's one red blip. Do you want to know who it is? The chef.

27
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:26,480
There are other chefs in here that can't see through. I'm just going to throw a fucking plate in this guy's face.

28
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:39,819
That just hurt me. Did this guy grab my leg? What is going on? What is hurting me?

29
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:46,139
What the fuck just killed me? Did I freeze in the freezer?

30
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,639
Oh, don't tell me you can freeze in the freezer. Do not give me that kind of power.

31
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,610
Hey, Gary, just the man I wanted to see. Hey, look, can you go ahead and grab me some extra kebabs from the freezer?

32
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,610
What a fucking idiot. What an idiot.

33
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:09,399
All right, now do me a favor, Gary. Fucking freeze. He's not freezing.

34
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:19,509
Is this guy immune to cold? Why is it? Why do I freeze in here but he doesn't? That's bullshit.

35
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:28,639
Gary. Put the guy on the chair. He won't even suspect a goddamn thing.

36
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:42,639
I wasn't supposed to kill that guy. It's easy.

37
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,100
Hey, I'm not doing anything in here. Are you seriously wondering how that guy died?

38
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,990
You opened the door and I did it. Don't fuck with the chef.

39
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,560
0800 hours. My mission is to find the mole.

40
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I've got to be quick. I've got to be silent and unseen.

41
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,310
I find my target. He's this guy. I throw a piece of china right in his mouth.

42
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,180
Mission accomplished. I can now escape undetected.

43
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,259
You know, I really wish they would play something else.

44
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,259
You're right, Jerry. And I agree. I think this piano player really needs to shut the fuck up.

45
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,689
Get some rock music in here. You know what I'm saying?

46
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm just being annoying right now. That's all I'm doing.

47
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm just ruining these people's dinner.

48
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:58,459
How am I going to go about... Excuse me. Excuse me.

49
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,139
Are you serious? Occupied. Get out of here.

50
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,139
What are you doing? Get away from me.

51
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:11,269
Oh, good afternoon. Yeah, there's somebody in this one.

52
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:15,019
Yeah, no, somebody's still in it. Thank you for understanding.

53
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:21,209
Second time. Third time. He doesn't... He's going to piss in my face.
