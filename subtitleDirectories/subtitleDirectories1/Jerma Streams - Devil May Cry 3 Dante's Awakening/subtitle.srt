1
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:48,520
I like this comment. Where is this fucking guy? I'm right here. How are you doing? Time to start

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:01:02,950
meowing. I'm good. I'm good. That's the quickest way to be like, no, no, I'm not doing that.

3
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:19,939
I'm good. Let me tweet. So you probably saw the title. Maybe you were here in the pre stream,

4
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,950
but we're going to go over very briefly what happened in the chat because I know that there

5
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:38,329
are like 15 games in this series and I'm starting with Devil May Cry 3. The big debate in pre stream

6
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:50,870
council has chosen. They actually chose five, but I vetoed it. Turned out that starting with three

7
00:01:52,250 --> 00:02:05,079
was considered by most people the right call. The smart thing to do. Three and five are one

8
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,870
storyline and then one, two, one and two are the same story or one, two, four and then three,

9
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:24,520
five. Is it, is it work like Star Wars? Like how does this work? It's four and five. It goes three,

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:34,979
one, two, four, five. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, I was thinking, do I start with one or do I start with

11
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:40,550
three? I was told start with three. I don't know how to do this shit anymore.

12
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,629
It's like, if you've never seen Star Wars, like how would you, how about, okay, wait, wait, wait,

13
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,270
wait, this is a better idea. How would you tell people to start Resident Evil? We're going to

14
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,889
talk about this. Resident Evil, Resident Evil. Do you have people start with the new ones?

15
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,610
Do you start with seven, eight, do the whole Ethan story? Do you start at one? I don't know

16
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,580
if I would recommend starting at one. Do, are you even into that? Would you do seven, eight,

17
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,580
then one, two, remake two or one, two normally? There's a couple of remakes in Devil May Cry,

18
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:28,599
right? And do you even put the other Resident Evil games on that list? It's like, it's Code

19
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,460
Veronica on that list, for instance, in like the play one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

20
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:42,439
Yes or no. That's why it gets tricky. There are five games in this series and there's multiple

21
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:51,830
timelines and storylines. So I get it. It's tough. So we're starting with three. You guys

22
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,150
ready? Devil May Cry, I didn't even do my tweet. Today's going to be a chill stream.

23
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:08,340
Just want to hang out and play, relax and have a nice evening together. Is this game hard?

24
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:23,139
When this game's hard, are they just like fun? Not really. The gameplay is the real content.

25
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:34,790
Yeah, let's just hang out. Somebody said wait, Code Veronica is shit. Resident Evil, I am

26
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:42,069
and look, I am a Resident Evil streamer. I am. I played, I've played all the Resident Evil games,

27
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:47,050
all of them. But I will agree that the Resident Evil is an interesting franchise because

28
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:55,689
they're one of the only franchises that has that main series, which is phenomenal. And then a ton

29
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:09,259
of kind of bargain bin straight to DVD movies that they also have. I swear I see a Resident

30
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:14,939
Evil property come out every couple of years and I just feel like it's go, it's right into

31
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:25,529
the bargain bin. Is that accurate? And then they got Resident Evil 4 remake comes out.

32
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,100
One of the best games I've played. I mean, that's absolutely one of the best games I've played this

33
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,310
year without a doubt. Resident Evil 2's remake. Favorite game of the fucking whole year when it

34
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:45,860
came out. Resident Evil 7 and 8. I really liked those. I thought they were good. Why are you

35
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,769
stalling? There's no stalling. I'm just hanging out. You've played like four games this year.

36
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,810
No, how many games have I played this year? I want to know. How many games have I played this year

37
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:06,579
on stream? All right, let me, I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a bet.

38
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:16,540
Do you think I have played more than 15 games this year? Yes, I have. Do you think it's all right?

39
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,459
We need to, nobody look yet. We need to vote first. A one minute poll. Quick before people,

40
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,339
it's going to take like five minutes to do this research. So we need to poll right now.

41
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:33,560
Have I played more than 20 games this year? Have I played more than 20 games this year? Yes or no?

42
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:41,610
It's literally one minute poll going up right now. Have I played more than 20 games since January

43
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:54,779
1st, 2023? 20 different individual games. No shot. 15 yes, 20 no. Well, let's find out.

44
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,779
All right. So there's a lot of people that don't think I've, how many, are you serious? How many

45
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:13,829
times have I streamed this year? Shut the fuck up. BNAF trailer. What? All right. All right. All

46
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:19,990
right. So 70% of you think I have not played 20 different video games this year. How many is it?

47
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:27,829
Somebody's doing it right now. Somebody was already on it. Jesus. Sorry. This is not the

48
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:35,290
Switch version. This is, this is the PC version on Steam or the HD collection. You've played 19

49
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:47,850
games this year. No, that's not true. And do we count the Xbox and PlayStation nights where I've

50
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,050
played like 40 games in three nights? Those, do those count? Those, I don't think those count.

51
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:59,079
I think those are all part of one collective kind of group of game, right? I don't think those count.

52
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,189
I'm talking like it's a stream. It's a, it's an individual stream of this game that I'm playing

53
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,709
regardless of if I play it more than once. Like how many actual individual games have come out

54
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,790
that we're not part of a, I'm going to play this Xbox game for 15 minutes and move on.

55
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:38,360
Is it actually 19? It says 31. 31. Let's go. Yeah. 31. I've played 31 games in 2023.

56
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:49,830
Is this the fifth month? What is that per month? That's a lot. That's a lot. 31 divided by,

57
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,590
Hey, that's five games a month. I've played, I've played five games a month on average,

58
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:20,730
five different games a month. It's six games a month. Whatever. That's fake one per week. Yeah.

59
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:31,419
What's wrong with that? Generous math. I'm good. Watch the FNAF trailer. I'll tell you,

60
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:34,860
I already know what happens in the FNAF trailer. It's going to start on a close-up of a phone.

61
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,139
It's going to be pitch black and you're going to hear a phone ringing and it's going to go like,

62
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,649
and then it's going to cut. It's going to fade to black and then,

63
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,139
and then white text is going to show up. You remember taking the first call

64
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:00,570
back on the phone. And we're very close by the way, we're literally zoomed in on the receiver

65
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:12,539
and then it fades out again, white text, but will you be there for the last call?

66
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,460
And then it fades in. We're in an office and it's,

67
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,539
it's some fucking A-list celebrity is on the phone and they're doing the,

68
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:29,110
hello. Oh, hello. Hello. And we're talking like an S tier celebrity. I don't know who it would be

69
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,710
like, Oh, Wally, are you kidding me? It's, it's Chris Pratt. He's the hello guy, right? It's

70
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:52,820
going to be an A-list celebrity. None of this happens. I don't, I don't want to watch the FNAF

71
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,860
trailer. All right. I will, I will privately right now watch the first 10 seconds of the

72
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:06,279
FNAF trailer and I'll let you know my thoughts. All right. Here we go. I'm privately going to

73
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:11,129
watch it on my own right here. Five nights at Freddy's. Here it comes. Okay. Here we go.

74
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:25,429
All right. You're tired of having the same old backyard birthday party for your child every year.

75
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,389
So I was wrong. I was very wrong. It should have been zoom in on the phone pitch black.

76
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,159
You were there for the first phone call. I would have hit so much harder.

77
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:03,179
Fake trailer. Wait, that's not even the real trailer. Wait, what? This is the official one.

78
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:23,159
All right. Show it. I have to press like two extra buttons to show it.

79
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:33,049
Yeah. All right. Fine. We'll watch it. I can, I can, I can, no, I can watch this, right? It's a

80
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:45,399
fucking trailer. All right. Let's watch it. All right. Let's watch it. Let's watch it. Spoilers.

81
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,070
It's the trailer for the movie. We're going to watch the trailer for five nights at Freddy's

82
00:12:50,070 --> 00:13:12,070
right now. Okay. Cause we care so much about this apparently. Five nights at Freddy's. All right.

83
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:24,940
I'll give you my thoughts. Show your face. No, I can't. I don't, I just can't today. I just can't

84
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,340
today. All right. Holland, you just messed with me. All right. Let's see how this is.

85
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:41,370
It's like 40 seconds long. Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. Yeah. Where fantasy and fun

86
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:52,840
come to life. Hit it guys. If you're watching this video means you've been selected as Freddy's

87
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:03,460
newest security guard. Hello. We're going to have so much fun together.

88
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:35,769
I mean, it's just, I don't know. I mean, if it's a 40 second trailer, I don't know what I can't tell

89
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:48,070
from what's going on here. I mean, is it, is it, is it going to, is it, I don't know. Is it like a

90
00:14:49,320 --> 00:15:01,379
good movie? I don't know. I haven't seen it. They didn't do the trailer that I wanted though.

91
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:05,980
You're stalling so bad. I'm not even stalling. It's been 15 minutes.

92
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,210
We just watched the Five Nights at Freddy's theatrical trailer. Is that stalling or is that

93
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:29,960
wow, current thing to talk about? We just installed this. Okay. No more stalling. I'm ready.

94
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:40,840
You couldn't give a rat's ass about Five Nights at Freddy's. I mean, okay, there's going to be,

95
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,659
I feel like we already know the whole thing. Five Nights at Freddy's has a pretty,

96
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:54,710
very elaborate lore. I'm not concerned about runtime. Why am I even giving you my thoughts

97
00:15:54,789 --> 00:16:06,789
on this? All right. Time to play Devil May Cry. Turn this up. All right. I said Five Nights at

98
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:17,019
Freddy's three. That's what we're doing tonight. Let's go. What a centrist take. I'm not going to

99
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,360
see that movie. Can I tell you, I can tell you that, right? I'm not going to see Five Nights at

100
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,480
Freddy's. I'm not going to see it. I won't watch it ever. This is never happening. I'm just telling

101
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,480
you that I'm not going to see the movie. Is it going to be fine? Maybe it'll be cool. Maybe

102
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,250
you'll like it. I'm not, I probably won't watch it because I still haven't even seen the Mario movie.

103
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,259
Do you think I'm going to be rushing to the theater to go see Five Nights at Freddy's?

104
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:55,960
I still have to, what do you, what does this mean? That's where it's fucked up, dude.

105
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,139
You're a lazy movie watcher. All right. Wait, what's, what does this mean? Gold or yellow?

106
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:10,809
What does it mean? Gold is continue. Yellow is restart level. Uh, I'm going to go with this one

107
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:24,950
then. I like that a lot. I'm a big fan of that. Go on. You've heard of it, haven't you? The legend

108
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:33,130
of Sparta. When I was young, my father would tell me stories about it. In ancient times,

109
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:40,490
a demon rebelled against his own kind for the sake of the human race. With his sword, he shut

110
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,970
the portal to the demonic realm and sealed the evil entities off from our human world. But since

111
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:54,579
he was a demon himself, his power was also trapped on the other side. I keep thinking of some

112
00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:03,940
celebrity doing that. Hello. Oh, and, and, uh, it's gotta be a soundtrack by Danny Elfman. You

113
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:21,369
know what I mean? You were there for the first call. Give me the reins. I'll fucking make it

114
00:18:21,369 --> 00:19:28,019
happen. Yeah. See, they get it. They know. Look at this. They knew what they were doing. They know

115
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:34,259
how to make fucking media close up on the fucking phone. Black pitch black coming up from black.

116
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:48,970
We're on the same wavelength. Sorry for business yet. It's a little quiet. I'll turn it up in a

117
00:19:48,970 --> 00:20:04,390
minute. I haven't even picked a name for this joint and I'm already you a customer too.

118
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:15,079
Well, if you want to use the bathroom, help yourself. The toilets in the back is your name.

119
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:29,430
Dante, son of Sparta. What did you hear that from your brother? He's got a small head.

120
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:48,410
Yeah, whatever. Who cares? Accept it. I don't think you want to mess with me, man. I can

121
00:20:48,410 --> 00:21:15,700
X, X, X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B, X, X, X, X, X, Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B better than anybody you know.

122
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:30,019
What is going on? He's got stuff sticking out of him. Okay.

123
00:21:39,460 --> 00:22:09,130
Man, it is really quiet. I'll turn it up. I'm sorry. Oh, now it's not quiet. What was that?

124
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:53,579
Why is he doing like, all right, tutorial time. This is okay. Select

125
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,940
from four basic styles. Use your select style action to show the enemies just how crazy this

126
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:07,500
party can get. So you pick from gunslinger, royal guard, trickster, or sword master and B

127
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:16,470
is your style attack. Okay. You feed enough enemies and eventually your style will level up

128
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:23,420
and you knew in wonderful style actions. So you have to play with a style to be able to level up

129
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:31,259
that style. Or do I actually do I have to pick one of these? I've seen a lot of people in chat here.

130
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:37,369
Okay. Hold on. You will master a new style action every time your style advances. Okay.

131
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:45,529
Gain experience points by defeating enemies. Change styles mid game via the mission start

132
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:50,900
screen. Okay. So you got to stick with something for a little while. You will begin the game with

133
00:23:50,900 --> 00:24:06,039
the trickster style pre-selected. Okay. Mission one, crazy party. Customize. Whoa. I did not know

134
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:15,769
there was all this. So these are my weapons. I think I only have these. That's it. All right.

135
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:24,980
Style. Let me read these information. Uh, allows player to avoid enemy attacks using special.

136
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,259
Okay. So this is probably a dodge role, which is, I think I'm probably going to pick that one.

137
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:35,779
Master different melee weapons and maximize each weapon's power. I like that too. I'm not going to

138
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:40,259
look at chat right now because I know you're telling me the meta. You're probably saying,

139
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:44,180
Hey dude, royal guard is literally don't do anything else, but I want to ruin my playthrough

140
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,559
before I look over here. So let's do it. Gunslinger. They're going to master different

141
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:56,170
guns. I like that. I like that. Royal guard minimizing the damage of an enemy attack.

142
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:06,940
All right. So this is defense, defense, ranged DPS, melee DPS and sort of like rogue kind of

143
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:15,799
survivability. So do I want to be like quick, quick, quick, quick fight, fight, shoot, shoot

144
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:29,589
or defend? I feel like I want to pick this one because I, I didn't, when I think of devil may

145
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:34,950
cry, and this might be a different, I'm thinking of a different game. Maybe when I think of devil

146
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,140
may cry, I've never played it, but I think of two pistols or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

147
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,619
Then holding them behind my head. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Then one forward and one behind

148
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,619
my head. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang spinning around. Both those guns are behind my head.

149
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,220
I'm not looking bang, bang, bang, bang. That's kind of, and that's what I'm thinking of.

150
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:13,779
That's Bayonetta. Well, why am I playing this? I'll try it. Go for it. All right. Master the true

151
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:24,759
power of Dante. So that's lock on, melee, style action, examine, shoot. All right. These two,

152
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,180
this is a special move and then jump. Character move is a taunt. Old right bumper, then press

153
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:43,380
left stick to change lock on targets. All right. Good to know. Yeah, that this is what I'm thinking

154
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:49,900
of. Okay. Red orb, a magic red stone of crystallized demon blood offered to the gods to earn new power.

155
00:26:50,859 --> 00:27:00,069
And is this just, can I mash? No, no, not good enough. Try mash as fast as I can.

156
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:09,980
Act different depending on the time. Oh, here we go. This is explaining to me. No, so why, why, why,

157
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:20,890
why, why, why, repeatedly press X to rapidly fire press X while jumping. Okay. So it's like, why,

158
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:41,180
why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why. I got an A. All right. I get it.

159
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:56,940
Is that it? Good job. I just got S. Oh, I need to lock on. Oh, it's hold lock on. Okay. Okay.

160
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:05,509
I feel like I'm going to like this game. I feel like I'm going to like it. Current enemy you are

161
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:12,970
locked on to will be displayed with a cursor and change the target with left stick. Taunting

162
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:21,980
increases the meter. Ooh, that's what I figured. So if you hold, okay. So that's to get to the

163
00:28:21,980 --> 00:29:00,630
closest enemy. Okay. I was seeing how long I could do that. So what's wrong with Devil May Cry 2?

164
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:30,220
Why does everybody hate it? Oh, wait, that's like a style move. Ooh. All right. I'm trying to figure

165
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,420
out the lock on. So if I lock on to somebody, how do I, do I, oh, I have to click the stick in. Okay.

166
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:46,339
I get it. And it just goes to the nearest. I got it. Okay. Magic green stone of crystallized

167
00:29:46,339 --> 00:30:00,970
demon essence. It require, it returns lost life. I'll take a C. That's fine. I didn't turn it up.

168
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:48,539
Sorry. It's terrible gameplay and story. The characters are all fucked. Oh, you ruined it.

169
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:58,660
Yeah. All right. All right. I didn't even know about the style points.

170
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:13,690
That's a B. B-A-B. B-A-B. B-A-B-I-B-O-O-B-I-B-I. Isn't that the three stooges?

171
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:44,470
Okay. I did not turn it up yet. I will right now. I promise. Did the graphics get better

172
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:55,640
after leaving that house? My shop, you're going to pay for that.

173
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:07,609
I almost wish he took an extra like five seconds to put that on her. 10 seconds.

174
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:40,700
Turn it up. I'm sorry. I got it. Okay. Blast the enemy into the air. Hold right bumper and press

175
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:49,049
Y while holding the left stick back. So this certain does different moves. It's not just Y,

176
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,009
Y, Y, Y, Y, B, B, B, B, B, B. You have to do certain combos. It's like playing Street Fighter.

177
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:25,559
Okay. Is that better? That's better, right? Are we happy with this? So hold Y. How come it doesn't

178
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:39,319
work? I'm holding Y. Hold Y. Oh, and you have to hit back. Oh, shit. Right. Ah, there it is.

179
00:33:46,490 --> 00:34:25,429
Ooh. All right. Ooh, that was cool. Oops.

180
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,130
I don't know why I just thought this was funny. I don't know why my brain just thought that I

181
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:47,880
was going to uninstall the game. Imagine uninstall the game was in the menu and it was one down from

182
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:56,820
resume game. Oh, thank God. All right. There is a dodge roll. I was going to say I've been,

183
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:05,380
I'm missing it. What the fuck are you saying, bro? I don't know. I think that'd be humorous.

184
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,420
All right. So there is a dodge roll. Thank goodness. I was going to say I didn't,

185
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,820
there wasn't one. I was going to be very, very unhappy about it.

186
00:35:17,539 --> 00:36:15,750
Get this thing out of here. Am I doing bad? Yeah. A little. Am I doing, I,

187
00:36:18,550 --> 00:37:03,940
ooh, boss fight versus death. Wow. What is that? Ooh. Oh shit. All right. Let's go.

188
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,099
I gotta get used to the game. I gotta get used to the controls.

189
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:53,880
I just, I just downloaded it 15 minutes ago. It's better. This is going better. I'll tell you one

190
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,800
thing that's kind of crossing me up is having to hold right bumper to dodge. I'm not used to that

191
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,460
and my brain pressing B or A dodges always. That's going to take at least an hour or five

192
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:32,780
to get used to. Nope. All right. Let's go. Okay. I'm going to fight death again. We're still alive.

193
00:38:33,989 --> 00:39:00,219
Oh, this idiot. Is it healing? Fuck. I'm not going to be able to beat this guy.

194
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:34,420
Do I get any gunslinger moves? I have no help. Yeah. Click left to change lock on.

195
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,900
Hi guys. I'm a from software Andy. You know, like I, every video game has to be played like

196
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:48,840
from software games or I can't play them. Like B is not dodge. I lose. I mean, there's no

197
00:39:48,840 --> 00:40:00,329
estus flask. I can do with X. I can't play it. It's over. This game's not for old people. I got it

198
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:15,480
right here. Let me just open your inventory. How do I do that? How do I open my inventory?

199
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:30,889
How do I open my inventory? It's E? No, I'm on a controller. Oh my God. I'm dead. This gets hard.

200
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:46,090
All right. This is a hard game. Oh, it's down on the D pad. All right. Okay. This is a hard game.

201
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:58,360
Is everybody laughing? Cause I picked gunslinger. Is that what, is that what I did wrong?

202
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:23,659
Well, all right. I'll try it one more time with gunslinger. Starting out with gunslinger is hard.

203
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:36,139
All right. Well, I'll try it one more time. Level one gunslinger is bad. Okay. All right. I'll

204
00:41:36,139 --> 00:42:14,099
change it if I, if I can't do it this time, you should be jumping way more neutral. Trump has

205
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,380
more iframes than your dodge roll. And where are the iframes? Are they at the very beginning or

206
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:56,260
the end of the middle? Where they at? Fuck. All right. I got half health. Is there a sprint?

207
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:12,039
How do I run? How do I move faster? Use trickster please. All right. This is my last try with this

208
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:33,960
All right. I got it. God damn it. That was quick. Oh my God. He's going to kill me again. I'm in

209
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,559
the tutorial. Is this game really? Okay. Wait, can I ask a question? Is this game really, really

210
00:43:39,559 --> 00:44:00,550
fucking hard? Is it supposed to be this hard? He's going to go, dude. People got rocked by this boss

211
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,989
back in the day. I mean, this guy's, this guy's no joke. This game is, don't put that on screen.

212
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:14,059
Don't put that on stream and ruin my life. It's already there. Okay. Don't put that on. Okay.

213
00:44:18,309 --> 00:44:28,150
Damn, this is hard. Okay. All right. Let me, how do I, how do I make it so I can, what's my style?

214
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:46,710
I'm not doing anything flashy. I'm just going to try to stay alive. I don't care if I get a D.

215
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:58,179
I just, I want to just beat it. Shit. I had to, I almost want to remap the dodge to just be like A.

216
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:15,239
That's the thing that's causing me the most problems right now. What did I just do?

217
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:29,340
Is there a way to move the camera quickly so I can actually see who I'm fighting?

218
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:40,900
This has got to be like a camera, like three position, right? All right. That didn't go as bad.

219
00:45:41,460 --> 00:46:02,010
I'm learning. All right. I'm back at full hope. Oh, that's how you do that. All right. That's fun.

220
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:34,090
I got it immediately to see. All right. Bosses. Here's the boss. Let's go.

221
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:45,559
Enemies off camera. Won't. Oh, this guy's still alive. All right. Let's go. This is the one. This

222
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:56,519
is the one right here. Rickster literally has a dodge on B. Please. I gotta, I gotta beat this

223
00:46:56,519 --> 00:47:44,570
guy. Dives and then jump. Oh my God. I'm like kind of parrying somehow. Oh, fuck that. Come on, man.

224
00:47:45,369 --> 00:48:08,780
Shit. What? I'm missing something here. I definitely tell you, if I got this game,

225
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:25,829
I would have cried and returned it. I would have cried. I would have cried. And you're like,

226
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:36,699
Hey, don't get it. Wait, is this game M? What is this rated? What is the game rated? Is this M?

227
00:48:37,659 --> 00:49:08,780
I probably still would have cried and returned it. Yeah. Cry. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hold on. Wait, I'm

228
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:18,420
getting some tips here. You can ride enemies. My worst fears of how a DMC stream would go are

229
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,730
coming true. They'll switch to Mario in no time. This is much harder than I thought it was going

230
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:32,699
to be. Well, okay. Hard is not necessarily the answer to the question. It's needing to have the

231
00:49:32,699 --> 00:50:03,980
controls mastered in the first five minutes. Come on, Gwen. What's going on here? This is

232
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,079
probably the hardest Devil May Cry game. I'm all for it. I know I'm all for it. I'm,

233
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,380
I just got to learn how to play the game. Well, I beat millennia. That doesn't matter.

234
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:45,530
I win every argument, but you use teach. You use teach. It doesn't matter. I don't care. All

235
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:51,110
right, let's go. I'm going to be the tutorial boss. I promise. I'll be the tutorial. I will.

236
00:50:51,829 --> 00:51:01,860
The original version is considered the hardest. I mean, I like a challenge. Let's go put it on

237
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:17,179
easy mode. No, I got it right here. Watch this. I got it. Where are the iframes? Where are the

238
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:45,690
iframes? How do I fucking dodge? Where are the iframes? God damn it. This is so fucking hard.

239
00:51:50,949 --> 00:52:02,820
Okay, we're going to, I'm going to, can I, can I do it from the menu? How do I do this? How do I

240
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:11,659
pick the one that's not horrible? Which one is it? Gunslinger. I picked gunslinger and I was

241
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:25,320
getting fucking destroyed. Can I do it from here? Do I have to do a new game? You can't rely on

242
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:47,059
iframes. I can from here? Oh, here we go. Okay. So normal to, wait, what's going on?

243
00:52:48,309 --> 00:53:02,789
Demo digest? I'm confused. What is this menu? All right. So this didn't work out that well.

244
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:20,809
Trickster. I'll try trickster. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. Vital Star S. Is this a heal?

245
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:31,510
I should buy this, right? Don't buy these. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Trickster.

246
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:43,860
So what can trickster do? We, I learned that. Oh my God. Way better. I, I, the movement is so

247
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:51,690
much more fluid and there's no longer an input delay on every single button. I was pressing

248
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:55,449
Y and it would be Y and then the movement happened about two to three seconds later.

249
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:02,440
Holy shit. This is way better. Yeah. I would hit Y to swing in three seconds with the Y. What an

250
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:48,579
input delay that was. That is hard mode. Thanks for letting me know. I love that move. Very cool.

251
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:56,360
Oh, there is a dodge roll. Yeah. It's so much better. This is way better. This is way more how

252
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:09,139
I want to actually play this video game. We're good. There it is. So this is a side roll and

253
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:23,260
then a jump back. I know that. And now I have this. All right. How much copium is it going to take

254
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:55,659
for me to get killed in the first 10 seconds of the tutorial bus? I wonder. Oh, come on. All

255
00:55:55,659 --> 00:56:20,760
right. I just got this. That's a heal. All right. Come on. Let's go. No more fucking around. All

256
00:56:20,760 --> 00:57:07,639
right. That's so much better. What was the eye frames? Oh, what's my menu? How do I take that

257
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:58,550
heal? Where's my heal up on the D pad? Got it. OK. I'm good. I'm good. I get it now. The dodge

258
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:25,639
roll changes the whole game. Why is everybody calling me DMC to Andy? What's that? DMC to is

259
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:41,210
all about your guns. Should have started with that one. DMC to sucks, dude. All right. That was

260
00:58:41,210 --> 00:59:15,320
cool. I get it. Nearly a year since we last met. Where does the time go dressed like Dante for

261
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:27,420
Halloween? You could always tell, you know, who's been going to the gym lately by their Halloween

262
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:44,090
costume. Dante from Devil May Cry is like I've been going to the gym lately. I can fill out this

263
00:59:44,170 --> 01:00:01,929
shirt. It's all right. Hey, I think that's fine. I'm super bad with time management.

264
01:00:02,489 --> 01:00:09,139
I'm really good with my orbs. I'm not that stylish, but not super bad. I mean, the clothes I wear

265
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:14,659
fine. I don't do very much damage, but I will eat all of your food. I'll use all the stuff in your

266
01:00:14,659 --> 01:00:23,019
house. I mean, that's like, I think that's pretty accurate to me. I don't know what orbs is. Is that

267
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:32,280
my brain? That's like how good, how strong my brain power is. That's the big orb in the middle

268
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:56,469
of my skull. Orbs is collectibles. Oh, OK. Orbs is money. Doesn't it excite you that Timon and

269
01:00:56,469 --> 01:01:10,730
Negru once ruled this earth as the medium between the human world? Isn't it a magnificent view?

270
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:19,059
Greatest minds of their time, those who revered evil constructed this glorious edifice.

271
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:27,239
Now, after two millenniums of confinement, it can at last fulfill the purpose for which it was

272
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:40,539
intended. That's none of my concern, did he? Of course, he's taking good care of it. After all,

273
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:48,869
I don't know who this is. It is the only memento left from him. He has no idea if it's true.

274
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:53,670
Oh, I got an unbelievable video idea. And I don't want to say it because I don't want anyone to

275
01:01:53,670 --> 01:02:27,380
steal it. I'm telling you, you guys are going to like this a lot. I might just put it on the

276
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:31,539
main channel because I don't know. I feel like it's going to it's going to annoy a lot of people

277
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:36,860
because this would be the first video I've uploaded. But I feel like it would be funny.

278
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:09,159
Cool. All right. But trickster is going fine. There's no way I can take it off trickster

279
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:25,130
because it's just not going to happen. Royal guard gets a block. That sounds awesome. I

280
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:30,840
might check it out. I'm all about defense and not taking damage when I play games like this.

281
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:37,530
I'm two times as high as normal by pushing off of certain surfaces so you can wall jump.

282
01:03:38,489 --> 01:04:25,639
That's kind of cool. Oh, and you can jump off. My goodness. Oh, okay. I got it. I got it. It's

283
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:42,389
fine. I'm sorry. I'm getting too caught up in trying to do like combos and not surviving.

284
01:04:42,389 --> 01:05:18,519
Just survive. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. Do attack, wait, attack, attack. That right.

285
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:36,820
Because it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I didn't learn that. They didn't teach me

286
01:05:36,820 --> 01:06:02,380
that. That's cool. That was a cool move. Okay. Any secrets or anything I should know about? New

287
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:11,750
gun. There are two types of sealed doors, red and blue. Release the door sealed by solving a puzzle

288
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:19,719
located in that room or defeat all the enemies. So red and blue. Blue is puzzle, red is. Okay.

289
01:06:20,519 --> 01:07:02,550
Devil may cry three. Dante's Inferno. Yep. Things are breakable. What is this? I can remember

290
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:15,059
everybody saying scorn. I've been trying to figure that out for like the last year. Shotgun. Cool.

291
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:21,960
I definitely want that. Forget about the two pistols. Switch guns with left trigger in real

292
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:40,420
time. I'm going to like this way more. You're a fucking liar. What? Don't accuse me of that.

293
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:56,539
Lying to somebody. I've never done that before in my life. Oh shit. Oh, I got, I got to bring

294
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,619
something up. This is really funny. I don't know why I thought about this. Holly and I were talking

295
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:06,010
about this. And do you want to, we were talking about what the ultimate Reddit test is. Like the

296
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:14,969
ultimate, the ultimate Redditor test. And you guys ready to take it? The ultimate Redditor test.

297
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:25,529
Like if you use Reddit, are you ready? Have you seen the Christopher Lee Lord of the Rings

298
01:08:25,529 --> 01:08:37,369
backstab video? Yes. If the answer is yes. You know, the one where he's like, Oh, what happened

299
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:50,100
is the air. If you've seen that video, I've seen that video probably 10 different times on Reddit

300
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:57,300
across like a decade. I had to, we were sitting to think about it. I was like, you know what?

301
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:05,270
I've seen that video every like a year or two. That video makes the rounds. It's been like a

302
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:29,819
decade. He admitted it. He's a Redditor. What about it, bro? What are you doing? I'm talking

303
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:54,859
and walking back and forth in the same room. Okay. All right. Stylish rank. I know what that

304
01:09:54,859 --> 01:10:07,850
means. It means to be better at the game. So don't get, Hey, well, thanks for letting me know.

305
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:36,699
All right. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. How come I'm not doing the thing with the swords in front of me

306
01:10:36,699 --> 01:11:00,789
anymore? One, one, two, tap. What the heck? Dude, just fucking lock in and mash already.

307
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:33,420
Good advice. Actually just hit me in the door. I don't know how I did that before. Honestly.

308
01:11:33,979 --> 01:12:10,579
All right. When no one's looking, why can I do it? Is there a move list somewhere? How do I get to

309
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:43,159
it? Library devil arms. Okay. Rebellion combo one. I know that rebellion combo too. I know that

310
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:53,539
helm breaker. I know this one. Yeah. I haven't, it hasn't taught me these. Okay. And I've been

311
01:12:53,539 --> 01:13:04,359
doing that one. Here it is repeatedly press Y while executing a type two combo. So I have to

312
01:13:04,359 --> 01:13:17,930
mash Y like this. It didn't work. Uh, you have to do it during the second. Okay. I think I got it.

313
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:45,340
Let me try it again. Nice. Okay. Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Starting to understand the game.

314
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:57,510
You know, I have to collect every, I'm, I'm, I, I'm, I'm an orb person, right? I always get a on

315
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:04,010
orbs. That's my thing. Your thing could, that's fine. Your thing could be gameplay and can be

316
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:22,329
getting S style and shit like that. I get S on orbs. I collect stuff. What's this thing?

317
01:14:22,329 --> 01:15:09,319
Do I have to do something with this? This is a DPS check. Oh, I got two of those fragments.

318
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:27,430
What does this mean? Statue of the omniscient god of time and space. By offering a demon blood,

319
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:34,920
one can attain the power of the ancient magic plans. Power up. Exchange orbs for items like

320
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:56,420
vital stars. Exchange orbs to learn new moves or power up your guns. Oh, all right. Shit. What is

321
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:03,100
this going to do? High speed lunge attack skewers them through the center.

322
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:14,060
So you have to be running while you do it. Is this one lightning quick sword swing that

323
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:30,380
sends a powerful shock wave. I like that. $10,000. Okay. So this one is I can upgrade it.

324
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:41,529
So hold that and forward and then press Y. I feel like I should get some of these.

325
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:53,079
I could buy a blue orb. Okay. What do four of these do? I'm going to get a couple of these.

326
01:16:53,720 --> 01:17:11,659
Is that dumb? I don't know. My new move seems pretty good. Can I combo it?

327
01:17:14,789 --> 01:17:30,310
Kind of. Ice guardian's chamber. This thing. I think this is probably going to be a boss fight.

328
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:42,060
I think how many viewers did you have when you started? Um, it was 70,000 people here.

329
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,979
I lost like a lot though. People with it. I took, I took a long time with the tutorial,

330
01:17:45,979 --> 01:17:57,430
so that's all right. All right. Do you mean ever? Cause that's not correct.

331
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:04,520
Do you mean like when I first turned the screen on ever? I don't know.

332
01:18:07,689 --> 01:18:10,970
I came from a different position in the. Hold on.

333
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:49,260
Thank you for a walk. Come on, puppy. Let's go. Is there enough silence? Worm. Incident.

334
01:18:49,979 --> 01:19:29,100
What are you doing? What's that move? Okay. Wow. I think you have to break the ice off the heads.

335
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:43,699
What does this happen? You can't even hurt this thing. You got to break the ice off.

336
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:52,170
That's very, yeah. See, I can't get close though. That's like death. If I get close.

337
01:19:52,170 --> 01:20:25,479
I don't know why I'm even trying it. Stop using guns. When I get close, I get scared.

338
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:40,520
The guns suck. Stop using them. My theory. Correct, bro.

339
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:53,989
Hey, is my theory correct? I need to know his moveset is.

340
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:41,930
Devil may cry free in stores at Walmart. Now pre-order for the devil may cry collectors

342
01:21:51,560 --> 01:22:25,590
Do you guys hear that? That was word. I'm probably going to add. Sit down. Sit down.

343
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:42,170
Come on. Come on. Look at this combo. Holy shit. It's like a 600 combo.

344
01:22:42,170 --> 01:23:42,520
Oh, fuck I got cocky tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap

345
01:23:43,520 --> 01:24:22,159
Wait, wait, whoa

346
01:24:37,460 --> 01:25:05,180
Come on get it. Holy shit. I'm getting what am I doing? What's happening here? I'm getting I'm getting so sucked up

347
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:17,539
Okay, we're good. We're good. I was just through so bad

348
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:34,229
I love this voice

349
01:25:34,430 --> 01:26:03,090
What's that thing? Nunchucks. Well, that's my new weapon for sure

350
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:21,869
Three-sided nunchuck. I'm never using the sword ever again

351
01:26:49,460 --> 01:27:09,819
Orbs yep, that's me. I collect orbs. Where are they? I lost orbs. What? Would they despawn?

352
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:17,520
I was testing my new weapon. They got a figure that you're gonna do that when you get it. Just testing my new moves though

353
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,399
Are you going to the park? What's the hurt you get an invitation?

354
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:40,310
This was the part where I walked out of the theater

355
01:27:51,180 --> 01:28:09,739
No, I would stay

356
01:28:29,829 --> 01:28:31,640
Hey

357
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,960
Look at that

358
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,520
See for orbs. How that's not even how did I lose out on?

359
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:50,800
Did I actually lose out on a lot? It was a lot hum. It was like 2k. Are you kidding me? Bye

360
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:59,720
I'm supposed to be the orb guy and I couldn't even do my couldn't even do my job that I'm supposed to be doing

361
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:04,970
Oh, that's bad. Oh

362
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:42,770
Well, it's okay, how come all my titles have that three face like we mod keeps doing that so I want to know who

363
01:29:59,369 --> 01:30:01,689
For a second, I thought this guy's clothes were on backwards

364
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:06,560
I thought he was wearing a jacket like the other way. No, that's not how I don't know

365
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,329
Why my brain just thought that for a second. I was like, wait, does he have his shirt? Oh, no, it's like a suit

366
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:30,779
Like a all the way up suit. All right. Do I want to change anything?

367
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:43,140
How am I still level one trickster? You're like that's I'm gonna be in a mobile game. I don't want to be a level one trickster

368
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,699
I'm curious

369
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:09,340
revolver level two

370
01:31:09,579 --> 01:31:11,579
Windmill I can do a windmill

371
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:20,369
Spin the nunchucks around in a propeller like motion to rapidly slice into the enemy. I like that

372
01:31:27,859 --> 01:31:36,039
Not enough orbs. Yeah

373
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:39,159
Yeah, don't remind me

374
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:51,329
I'm alright for now. I'll try this new stance though. This is the PC version. This is the part of the HD collection

375
01:31:51,810 --> 01:32:05,510
This level is going to take you two hours

376
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:21,520
Is he saying that because they just introduced the map system map goes off your surrounding area from an overhead perspective

377
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:29,130
Interesting. Okay. It shows a graphical image from the room you currently occupy. Yeah

378
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:32,720
Press the d-pad to view the various floors you have visited

379
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:59,000
So I get it this is where I am and this is where I'm going I get it I'm Tays inferno

380
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:05,060
Redditor wrong game

381
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:28,279
Wrong entire series. I don't know why I keep saying that there a double jump. No

382
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:36,319
You got to be really just strict with you have to go like, okay

383
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:48,720
Okay, this is a lot harder than it looks

384
01:33:48,840 --> 01:34:02,960
There we go. That's actually a lot harder than it looks. I'm actually kind of surprised. I just did that this door

385
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:32,600
Dope Oh

386
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:41,579
Red door means enemies Dante press B

387
01:34:41,579 --> 01:35:05,069
I like the nunchuck during a certain circumstance you can repeatedly press a button to execute a special high-speed combo attack. Yeah

388
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:43,449
Okay, so that has to be with the sword. Oh, dude. Yeah, I'll do it. You know, you know, it's not a weapon switch now

389
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:46,069
You gotta come back to the stream. He knows what he's doing now

390
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:52,840
Bro, I told you I was going to eat dinner like fucking 40 minutes ago. Stop messaging me

391
01:35:53,479 --> 01:36:43,340
Did you see my last message stop? You just messed up my combo. Where is this person? All right, that's not fair

392
01:36:43,340 --> 01:37:02,189
They're in a weird spot and I can't change the camera. Everybody else hit hit wall. Hit hit. All right

393
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:22,199
That's too advanced for me. Do more static X's. Hey, it was my birthday yesterday. Can you Elmo for me?

394
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:28,609
I'm sorry. I have a strict policy where I can only do an Elmo if it's somebody's birthday today

395
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:34,100
Right now being with the will of the thunderstorm. I bestow the soul of steel

396
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,680
I'd do like a magic spell on this one

397
01:37:52,119 --> 01:37:59,930
So I gotta go up that way

398
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:17,779
Not over here. Does the map tell me where I'm currently standing or is that just the room I'm standing in?

399
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:28,359
Okay, so that little indicator does not tell me where I'm standing. That's just I thought the little yellow diamond was where I was standing

400
01:38:28,359 --> 01:38:33,510
So what do I get for doing this?

401
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:37,529
Just money and then have to come back and do an electrical spell to that thing

402
01:39:06,789 --> 01:39:22,079
Okay, this way's too much how can I break these

403
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:40,100
Of course I can you think the Lakers are gonna win tonight. I will give you a prediction. I think the

404
01:39:40,739 --> 01:39:43,859
Lakers are gonna take it

405
01:39:44,859 --> 01:39:49,899
95 to

406
01:39:49,899 --> 01:39:50,819
86

407
01:39:50,819 --> 01:40:25,060
You're gonna lose money if you bet that number. I don't even know what the context but yeah

408
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:31,319
Hey, buddy, I don't know if I would do that. I wouldn't take that bet

409
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,960
We understand this the streamer

410
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:39,279
Who hasn't watched a basketball game since he was 14?

411
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:43,430
So I told me that's very sad. Oh

412
01:41:05,069 --> 01:41:17,800
You just ruined everything that was that was really sloppy. I

413
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:22,800
Cleaned it up at the end

414
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:51,750
That like a parry or something. Let's go. It's a combo extender the orbs

415
01:41:52,630 --> 01:42:01,920
Who was it Lakers even playing right now?

416
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:21,000
I don't even know the answer that question playing Denver. Look at mod for a score update right now. Oh

417
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:26,199
It's a hundred and eighteen to 104 Lakers are down right now

418
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:33,689
Don't yeah, do not bet that they can't take points away in basketball. Yeah, I'm coming in

419
01:42:33,689 --> 01:42:38,000
I'm just uh, I want to put a bet down on the game that's going on right now. Sure

420
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,319
What what can I do for you? Yeah, I get that lake is gonna take it I think 95

421
01:42:43,319 --> 01:42:45,909
9586 um

422
01:42:45,909 --> 01:42:50,359
You want you want to take that you bet that's what you're betting right now

423
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:56,750
Yeah, it's that Lakers gonna take it sir. I

424
01:42:57,470 --> 01:42:59,630
I'll take the money

425
01:42:59,630 --> 01:43:17,250
Um, I can make that jump. What are the odds on that again? It's like guys. I got 15 to 1 20 21

426
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:27,079
Well, sir, the odds are that right our zero. That's all right stuff. That's our how fucking still do it. You sell cigarettes here

427
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:50,659
I'm gonna fall off this look at my health. What?

428
01:43:51,220 --> 01:44:22,619
That was annoying. All right, we got a

429
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:26,979
Okay, how am I supposed to deal with that?

430
01:44:27,180 --> 01:45:02,060
Damn, this is horrible. It's horrible

431
01:45:02,859 --> 01:45:16,800
No, I want to target. I want to customize the controls

432
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:33,890
I don't like the pressing in left stick to change kind of annoying to do having to push left stick in to change target

433
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:57,210
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't like it. You kill me. I'll be very upset. Okay, we're good

434
01:46:09,859 --> 01:46:12,659
Off-screen enemies won't initiate attacks. It's a balance

435
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:16,699
That's actually really good

436
01:46:18,569 --> 01:46:42,010
Where am I going I can go up through this door or right back I'm gonna go up right? Oh, man

437
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:45,890
We had a boss again. I like that though. I

438
01:46:46,729 --> 01:46:48,289
Really like that

439
01:46:48,289 --> 01:46:51,300
Although I really don't like having no help

440
01:46:56,050 --> 01:47:08,390
How far back is the checkpoint if I lose here? I'm kind of concerned. Is it just that door?

441
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:10,069
All right, so don't waste the help

442
01:47:10,069 --> 01:47:16,979
All right, you got to do it in sections

443
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:24,829
We'll go sword for this too. Hey, where's the guy that goes?

444
01:47:27,210 --> 01:48:05,029
Okay, what do you can I fall down? Oh, I can I thought it was death I want to turn him red

445
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:09,640
He's kind of looks like ribs. Yeah. All right, you turn him red

446
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,100
Then he hides away

447
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,479
Then go back out

448
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:28,449
Okay, so unironically I have to jump on top

449
01:48:29,010 --> 01:48:48,369
That was good

450
01:48:48,369 --> 01:49:02,000
unironically

451
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:36,680
Shit I missed come on. Sorry. I'll get it. Try the V attacks. Oh shit. I'm Tazin Burnham

452
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:14,060
Somebody complained about the refs of the Lakers game in here. All right, this isn't that bad. I think I get it

453
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,579
Can we do a poll?

454
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:30,180
Who do you guys want to win Lakers or Denver? It's definitely gonna be the Lakers, right?

455
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:39,060
What's going on right now?

456
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:45,399
Things were going really well until

457
01:50:45,520 --> 01:51:02,939
Five seconds ago. All right. Somebody said they hate this boss now. I understand why

458
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:22,079
Where where are you? Yeah, what does this jumper remind me of? It's like it's super sticky

459
01:51:23,159 --> 01:52:09,359
It's like a straight up straight down. I feel like I weigh seven million pounds. That wasn't bad over here

460
01:52:13,659 --> 01:52:34,699
I'm gonna heal

461
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:52,520
Like most of chat voted for the nuggets because they're hungry do not let these despawn. Oh

462
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:02,579
Good a good helping a chicken nuggets. That sounds pretty good

463
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:18,159
That was cool. So there's one direction. I didn't go which is this way

464
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,569
Is it not going the right way? I wish I could tell if I was facing north or south. Try B button on nunchucks

465
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:42,239
Seems kind of good

466
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,840
astronomical board powered by time

467
01:53:47,460 --> 01:54:11,930
Normally 15 minutes left in the game, right? No, I don't kidding

468
01:54:12,449 --> 01:54:16,670
Somebody said he wants to stop playing so bad. No, I'm I'm fucking around. I'm having fun

469
01:54:35,399 --> 01:54:37,399
Your tricks

470
01:54:42,039 --> 01:54:44,039
Here's that big nose

471
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:50,439
Just hear me out you got nothing to lose, right?

472
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:57,159
My name is Jester and I know a thing or two about this place

473
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:59,720
That thing there

474
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:04,960
Is a power generator for this entire sector in order to open

475
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:10,760
The door you need to apply a little something. Looks like you and my teeth aren't that nice

476
01:55:38,819 --> 01:55:50,560
Is what the something is remember that kid write it down on your hand if you don't trust your head

477
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,340
You

478
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:08,220
Guys understand what I have to go through just to brush my teeth in the morning you still piss me off

479
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:23,640
That's just how it is

480
01:56:24,319 --> 01:56:35,069
BBC DS brushes his teeth in the shower. Sometimes you can save a lot of time

481
01:56:47,899 --> 01:56:49,579
CBD gamer

482
01:56:49,579 --> 01:57:16,859
Alright, okay. I need to see them all so I'm gonna pick royal guard you save two minutes by brushing your teeth in the shower

483
01:57:17,939 --> 01:57:22,340
and help

484
01:57:22,779 --> 01:57:25,020
Don't be humble just take it

485
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:40,250
Whatever you've done

486
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:49,640
You could see the conclusion of this battle if you pre-ordered devil may try three

487
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:27,260
Collectible art booklet included. How do you deal with birds like that? It's like that

488
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:48,840
The hell I do it. Oh, I have a different move right?

489
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:58,619
My brain has so much trouble with multiple button context menus

490
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:05,060
Like holding right bumper and pressing X and then hitting like left trigger and then pressing Y

491
01:59:05,859 --> 01:59:16,539
And then pressing in left stick and then switching. It's a lot of combinations

492
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:58,600
It's a lot of combinations that are just across the whole map. I dodged it the wrong the exact wrong time get over here

493
02:00:13,939 --> 02:00:46,449
crazy good

494
02:00:46,569 --> 02:01:08,569
Get that up to a where's that thing old why with the sword launch?

495
02:01:11,810 --> 02:01:28,180
Came out in 2005 I forget just how old this game really is kind of forget. Wait, I have to fight him

496
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:30,420
I thought it was my friend

497
02:01:30,739 --> 02:02:23,619
God, all right. Watch out for the work shit. I

498
02:02:25,100 --> 02:02:53,479
Just got that was good. I can't even move

499
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:35,140
Watch out shit my name

500
02:03:40,739 --> 02:04:08,739
Why is it

501
02:04:10,739 --> 02:04:20,729
Oh

502
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:24,930
All right, how do I hear what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll what's he'll all right, it's up on the d-pad

503
02:04:25,170 --> 02:05:16,630
That was a tick-tock. Oh

504
02:05:16,630 --> 02:05:23,909
So now I'm starting to understand why people like this game so much

505
02:05:24,109 --> 02:05:33,789
Let me give you my first impression after an hour or two. This game is its bosses

506
02:05:33,789 --> 02:05:36,909
You just fight a shitload of bosses. Is that correct?

507
02:05:37,310 --> 02:05:51,550
It's just run down a hallway and fight a few things, but then fight the boss. I like games like that

508
02:05:52,170 --> 02:06:12,779
I enjoy them. I like fighting against bosses. I can't go this way. Can't jump down you fight a few things and make it look cool

509
02:06:14,779 --> 02:06:20,140
Where am I going?

510
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:38,699
Straight and then straight does that make sense? Is your taunt and your pause the same for some reason?

511
02:06:38,699 --> 02:06:44,199
Uh, I can answer that so I'm pressing select because in my mind

512
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:47,359
See in my brain in my brain. So my brain does this thing in my mind

513
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:52,399
They forget about like the sentence that I say for every other sentence

514
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:55,039
This is the map

515
02:06:55,039 --> 02:06:57,880
Like this is come on. I'm trying to press I'm trying to open the map

516
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:12,149
Or like a sub menu and then I realize it's start and then in the start menu. He does this thing with his mind

517
02:07:15,810 --> 02:07:39,789
Get it again. How do I get across this? I can't get across that the orbs here. I didn't get

518
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:59,010
Just go it's fine. Oh, we bring it back the just go meme. That's an old one. I remember just go

519
02:07:59,369 --> 02:08:31,020
That's an old one. Okay

520
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:32,899
Is it fall damage?

521
02:08:32,899 --> 02:09:02,800
All right. I think I want the windmill hold down right bumper plus back and press apply. I

522
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:17,270
Don't want to waste too much money

523
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:30,439
How many of these do I have? How come I only have two blue orbs didn't I have three?

524
02:09:30,439 --> 02:09:37,930
I thought I had three fragments. Oh

525
02:09:40,869 --> 02:09:58,539
I bought a I bought a blue orb. What can I even do with it? Damn it. It's expensive. It's just more health bar. Oh

526
02:09:59,539 --> 02:10:05,640
Very cool. I'm saving my money. I am gonna buy

527
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:08,770
one more of these I

528
02:10:08,850 --> 02:10:14,010
Know this is so look at how stupid this is now. It's just gonna keep going up

529
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:25,319
I know you just spit out your food and you were eating a taco and you just made a mess everywhere. I'm sorry

530
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:36,409
You just could not believe what I just did and it fell down and went into the couch. You're sitting on

531
02:10:36,930 --> 02:10:42,630
Down into like the crevice next to you, which always sucks. It's like, okay, that's food

532
02:10:42,630 --> 02:10:46,680
I have to go fucking find that and it's gonna take me probably

533
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:51,140
20 minutes to get it all cleaned up because it went down into the fucking couch

534
02:10:51,939 --> 02:10:56,359
Especially with something like lettuce. Oh

535
02:10:57,069 --> 02:11:01,069
Man, it's gonna stick to something at the bottom of the you're gonna it's gonna be awful. It's like you like an hour

536
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:24,199
Okay, I wanted these something else open too. Where was it? I saw it. It was an item right there

537
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:33,930
Has this happened to you an ornament, okay

538
02:11:39,649 --> 02:11:46,460
Has this happened to you? Yes, this happens very frequently and it's always I I

539
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:53,979
Eat a lot of meals on the couch. I actually prefer sitting on the couch and eating things like dinner

540
02:11:53,979 --> 02:12:01,840
I just feel like it's better that way. It's like just I love it. Just like alright, I'm sitting on I got I have a table

541
02:12:02,279 --> 02:12:07,619
But something about eating just sitting on couch

542
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:12,220
Is so good

543
02:12:12,500 --> 02:12:14,500
I'm missing something here

544
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:23,789
What's up that on TV? You give you got a TV there?

545
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:34,619
What's the what am I doing now?

546
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:58,689
Let me pay attention for a sec. Can I go up there?

547
02:12:59,289 --> 02:13:06,390
All right, I gotta go up there. Yeah sitting down putting on

548
02:13:07,149 --> 02:13:10,720
That's what I I will tell you when I talk about

549
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:15,680
Oh, yeah, when I watch this other person's stream or I watch the streamer or I watch a YouTube video or a TV show. I

550
02:13:16,619 --> 02:13:18,619
Wish I was making this up

551
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:23,180
I've been eating food

552
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:31,000
Every single time I mentioned this I opened up a wall down here. I wasn't it was I picked it up right here

553
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,079
It was right there

554
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:37,270
What does it go though?

555
02:13:37,270 --> 02:13:38,939
down here

556
02:13:38,939 --> 02:13:43,109
Like what is this? Wait, I don't know

557
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,420
blue door

558
02:13:46,420 --> 02:13:55,710
Didn't I go in the blue door though? Yeah. Hold on

559
02:13:56,369 --> 02:14:03,680
That's a very weird jump this way. Oh

560
02:14:10,579 --> 02:14:22,010
I mean, it's alright. It's alright. I don't love it

561
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:40,020
Can't say I like it. Are we useful in some places? Yeah, but I'm what I'm saying is every piece of media

562
02:14:40,020 --> 02:15:05,460
I've ever watched or ever consumed I had food in front of me. What does this do?

563
02:15:09,649 --> 02:15:25,380
It is actually a parry the parry block. Okay. Oh, yeah, where do I put it in here? I

564
02:15:35,739 --> 02:15:38,939
Put that somewhere

565
02:15:42,939 --> 02:15:44,939
This goes up. Oh

566
02:15:44,939 --> 02:15:47,260
Right. Okay, right, right, right

567
02:15:48,100 --> 02:16:04,869
For some reason I did not think this had three prongs. I thought it was one. It's a fork man

568
02:16:04,869 --> 02:16:07,869
Come on, we didn't say Gwen afterwards. So I don't understand what you wrote

569
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:29,300
Essence of a powerful and fearless soul eating ice cream while moderating, you know what challenge I'd love to see

570
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:32,780
You know, you see speed running no hit speed run fastest time

571
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:37,680
I want someone to beat Elden Ring while holding a soft serve ice cream cone

572
02:16:38,239 --> 02:16:49,879
And they have to like lift the sides and by the way you get points off for all the drips on your hands

573
02:16:50,680 --> 02:17:01,600
How fast is the Elden Ring speed run right now like 12 minutes? I think you could pull that off a

574
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:17,000
new category

575
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,680
cone percent

576
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:46,639
Wait, please have a hair cam. No, no, not tonight. What about a door cam?

577
02:17:47,159 --> 02:18:00,889
What about one naked cam? No, didn't we talk about one time?

578
02:18:01,409 --> 02:18:02,979
If

579
02:18:02,979 --> 02:18:08,360
What was it? It was like what would it be worth if I would have be like scream naked?

580
02:18:08,920 --> 02:18:11,920
We try to come up with a number. We're not scream, right?

581
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:17,079
But like let's say I had like a platform where you could see me naked and I remember people like

582
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:19,139
What was this?

583
02:18:19,139 --> 02:18:23,790
No, I'm not doing this

584
02:18:23,790 --> 02:18:29,520
I'm just we were making a stupid joke about this a year or two ago and it was

585
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:33,379
What how much money would I make doing that?

586
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:47,709
Versus anything else and you guys convinced me that it would be insane. I was like, oh

587
02:18:48,469 --> 02:19:07,250
You got to market it. It's literally free money, dude

588
02:19:07,889 --> 02:19:09,010
No

589
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:23,510
Yeah, I'll do it. It's a free money. Don't how you know, I'll be so funny if you did that. Oh my god

590
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:28,969
I'll be wicked funny. Yeah, I'll be laughing my ass off if you did that Jerma

591
02:19:30,229 --> 02:19:34,829
Please please please please god, please if there is a god, please if there is a god, he'll do it

592
02:19:34,989 --> 02:19:37,729
Please if there is a god, I know what you're doing

593
02:19:38,170 --> 02:19:50,329
You don't think I fucking see right through you bullshit. All right. Now, where do I go? I got that soul thing

594
02:19:50,690 --> 02:20:05,950
Can I go in this door crimson flames twist and dance around the door keeping all would be trespassers at bay

595
02:20:06,590 --> 02:20:11,520
back to the bridge room

596
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:35,850
Bridge room is all the way around. Although can I can I go left? I

597
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:38,370
Guess I get a green door

598
02:21:01,209 --> 02:21:05,360
Do I go I'm this

599
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:16,549
Can get that I can get up there I can definitely get up there

600
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:30,590
Shit fucking hard

601
02:21:30,909 --> 02:21:53,989
They wouldn't change the camera angle if you weren't supposed to be over here in a wall jump

602
02:21:54,530 --> 02:22:10,379
It's kind of hard to do though. I'm honest jump up on the other pipe

603
02:22:10,899 --> 02:22:12,899
I'm trying

604
02:22:35,649 --> 02:22:37,649
My whole body wants to just move

605
02:22:38,370 --> 02:22:45,639
Okay, what I need to go into that little door into that little crevice right there

606
02:22:46,219 --> 02:22:53,370
It's just so the those of you that played this game. You know how this jump is

607
02:22:53,809 --> 02:23:12,139
It's like I don't know I can't even describe it. All right, what the hell is that it I got it

608
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:30,000
There's nothing else for me here to go to how do I get out of this? Let me see. Yeah, there's nowhere to

609
02:23:34,479 --> 02:23:36,479
There's another door

610
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:44,510
Where's the other door? There's the green one here

611
02:23:53,069 --> 02:24:02,379
Other side of the fence

612
02:24:02,379 --> 02:24:06,280
Go to the yellow door. You mean the one in?

613
02:24:06,719 --> 02:24:08,719
Hold on. I'm getting confused

614
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,329
I'm gonna go up there

615
02:24:11,329 --> 02:24:18,440
Goodness

616
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:29,950
Thank goodness. Let's go. I

617
02:24:29,950 --> 02:24:31,229
could

618
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:37,659
How would you have known you could do this without me literally reading it in chat?

619
02:24:38,180 --> 02:24:49,250
How would I ever know you could do that? You have to read it. I am the combat

620
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:55,379
Adjudicator only a technique. I see cool to the core. Well, look what I got

621
02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:23,409
Come on I have two moves to do

622
02:25:24,209 --> 02:25:26,389
These aren't cool enough for you

623
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:36,790
There it is. Okay one more of those and I'm good

624
02:25:37,329 --> 02:25:45,840
You're in the soul of steel

625
02:25:47,159 --> 02:25:50,840
Inside of every collectible pre-order box of devil may cry for

626
02:25:51,879 --> 02:26:02,959
Is the soul of steel plastic toy you could claim your own it also comes with a

627
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:08,760
10 inch tall figure of Dante himself. What did I just do?

628
02:26:09,639 --> 02:26:16,360
Secret mission. Oh

629
02:26:16,440 --> 02:27:32,790
I don't think i'm gonna be able to do that. Oh my god. Let me get the sword out goodness. Okay, fuck off

630
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:20,180
Oh

631
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:28,920
My god, I had it. It's just like I fucking was in sludge. Oh, I was in sludge

632
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:36,739
I was in sludge. I when you locked on and you walk you walk

633
02:28:37,889 --> 02:28:40,469
You don't run and I just was walking in quicksand

634
02:28:45,940 --> 02:29:19,459
I got it orbs speaking of orbs. I just got a new one

635
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:26,850
Oh

636
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:32,950
Bottle is now a permitted term

637
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:38,000
For now until I well, I just said that so now it's gonna be gone

638
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:51,799
What is this behavior? This is behavior we're seeing over here

639
02:29:53,079 --> 02:29:56,559
You guys supposed to be you guys must behave

640
02:30:03,139 --> 02:30:11,000
All those orbs are missing

641
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Ah, that sucks

642
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:18,870
Okay

643
02:30:18,870 --> 02:30:20,870
Wait, I want those orbs

644
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:48,120
Try the parry

645
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:50,280
I think i'm probably gonna go back to trickster

646
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:53,670
Having a dodge roll is just so so good

647
02:30:54,549 --> 02:31:11,520
That was not bad

648
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:26,450
You gotta be shitting me

649
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:44,870
That's just a lot of meter or whatever you want to call it. They having fun. Yeah. No, this is great

650
02:31:45,750 --> 02:31:49,649
I'm just hanging out and playing i'm having a good time

651
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:07,799
um

652
02:32:07,799 --> 02:32:09,959
Sorry, i'm paying attention to fighting am I supposed to get off?

653
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:20,600
I need to kill them faster

654
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,579
They need to get off. Oh shit

655
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:30,100
I got it. We're good

656
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:32,659
Let's go for it. They're weighing the elevator down

657
02:32:55,079 --> 02:32:57,079
Oh my god

658
02:33:03,649 --> 02:33:05,889
At the very least I have to change the lock on button

659
02:33:08,920 --> 02:33:10,920
It's making my life a living hell right now

660
02:33:13,799 --> 02:33:21,799
Can I do it through here? Please tell me I can do it through here. Thank goodness. Okay

661
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:27,729
Change target. What do I want to do item is up

662
02:33:28,370 --> 02:33:36,079
Map is right change target. I don't know. What if I make that?

663
02:33:53,879 --> 02:33:58,159
I I don't think there is a better button maybe one of the triggers

664
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:08,719
But I definitely don't want change going to be left stick. Oh, that's not bad

665
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:16,579
Oh, that's actually not horrible. Yeah, actually, but I have to take my finger off

666
02:34:17,139 --> 02:34:23,040
I'm gonna take my hand off them. Actually, he's not great in theory. It seemed like a good idea though. Appreciate the help

667
02:34:30,920 --> 02:34:47,329
Honestly, even right stick would be better. I think i'm happier with right stick because then I can do

668
02:34:51,139 --> 02:34:55,250
I think yeah, that makes more sense to me. That's good. All right, let's go

669
02:34:56,049 --> 02:34:59,190
It's a hard game

670
02:34:59,959 --> 02:35:01,959
Are you speaking in simlish? No

671
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:14,370
Give me the shotgun for this too

672
02:35:14,370 --> 02:35:16,370
I honestly probably shouldn't even lock on anybody

673
02:35:19,510 --> 02:35:21,350
All right. This is

674
02:35:21,350 --> 02:35:23,350
This is this is very

675
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:25,510
Like you get knocked off the

676
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:52,100
God only use neutral inputs. I'm trying to knock them off with the uh that but that's probably a bad idea

677
02:35:52,340 --> 02:36:05,969
I'm just gonna stand in the middle

678
02:36:05,969 --> 02:36:21,280
Don't move

679
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:33,670
Die already

680
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:42,049
There we go. Finally took me long enough

681
02:36:42,610 --> 02:36:55,989
Break everything

682
02:36:55,989 --> 02:37:02,450
All right. All of you devil may cry

683
02:37:02,530 --> 02:37:07,559
lore masters

684
02:37:07,559 --> 02:37:09,639
What what should I realistically get next?

685
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:21,120
air hike it's 20k

686
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,829
I'll save for air hike. I'll hold on. I'll hold on

687
02:37:26,469 --> 02:37:32,549
What if I got windmill part two?

688
02:37:39,590 --> 02:37:42,479
What does holy water do?

689
02:37:42,479 --> 02:37:44,719
End off demons. It severely damages enemies

690
02:37:45,360 --> 02:37:53,479
Very what is it gold or magic golden stone made by a secret process can recall lost souls

691
02:37:54,440 --> 02:38:00,530
Don't buy anything don't buy anything. Okay, it gets you drunk

692
02:38:01,489 --> 02:38:05,829
It's

693
02:38:05,829 --> 02:38:07,829
It's an extra life. That sounds great

694
02:38:15,889 --> 02:38:20,629
Items are for cowards

695
02:38:42,920 --> 02:38:44,920
What is

696
02:38:48,200 --> 02:38:50,440
How long are you two gonna keep carrying on like this

697
02:38:51,239 --> 02:38:54,920
In case you didn't get the hint i'll spell it out your guest

698
02:38:55,719 --> 02:38:57,239
Wants to go through

699
02:38:57,239 --> 02:38:59,239
Got it enough

700
02:39:06,690 --> 02:39:10,399
Give me one

701
02:39:10,399 --> 02:39:13,969
Oh, they are way smaller. I thought they were huge

702
02:39:14,770 --> 02:40:11,520
Let's go. Come on

703
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,690
All right back up back up back up back up

704
02:40:15,010 --> 02:40:36,069
Walking should be illegal for the enemies to do in video games

705
02:40:54,500 --> 02:41:00,870
Oh

706
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:15,590
Oh

707
02:41:15,590 --> 02:41:18,770
Oh, who am I attacking here?

708
02:41:18,770 --> 02:41:25,270
Shit i'm trying to just get rid of one

709
02:41:26,149 --> 02:41:55,829
I'm dead. All right. I gotta I gotta burn one down quick. Does it count that I all right? I gotta burn one down

710
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:58,200
Very very fast

711
02:41:58,200 --> 02:42:42,209
I'm gonna go with the green guy

712
02:42:42,209 --> 02:42:59,010
Come on

713
02:42:59,010 --> 02:43:00,370

714
02:43:00,370 --> 02:43:18,819
I thought I said

715
02:43:18,819 --> 02:43:20,819
Um, this is very hard

716
02:43:21,379 --> 02:43:31,620
Okay, I got it. Oh, I could change my style. I'm not even using this thing

717
02:43:32,979 --> 02:44:31,639
All right, got one break guard break guard break

718
02:44:53,350 --> 02:45:43,079
How do I heal? All right, let's go. Uh, so they

02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,520
All right. This is

720
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:54,520
Not great. I don't know

721
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:56,520
Okay. Thanks for the thanks for the heads up

722
02:46:33,409 --> 02:46:47,729
Get up got it. That was hard

723
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:54,840
Yes

724
02:47:12,450 --> 02:47:19,239
Okay, but on one condition what is it name it no talking

725
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:28,020
No talking

726
02:47:28,979 --> 02:47:33,440
Whoa, they think all right. I want to use these I don't care what any other weapon is

727
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:38,440
This looks he's a cool

728
02:47:51,159 --> 02:47:54,229
I don't know. I kind of I think I would want to

729
02:47:54,790 --> 02:48:00,450
I would want to talk don't you think you'd want to ask a few questions just pass the time a little

730
02:48:01,649 --> 02:48:08,040
I would be the annoying one to them fire

731
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:10,040
And tornado

732
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:14,639
Okay, you can only have two different weapons at a time

733
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:26,879
Got to change it up. So what do I have? I I can't change that now, right?

734
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:49,750
I'll try it instead of the sword. I had that had to been much better

735
02:48:50,629 --> 02:48:52,690
what

736
02:48:52,690 --> 02:48:54,719
Yep

737
02:48:54,719 --> 02:48:57,090
Okay

738
02:48:57,090 --> 02:48:59,430
All right

739
02:48:59,430 --> 02:49:00,899
Hey

740
02:49:00,899 --> 02:49:07,840
I got the orb. That's all the matters, right?

741
02:49:08,399 --> 02:49:15,090
Hey, dude, do you want us to disable the tweet command because you yeah, I mean

742
02:49:15,889 --> 02:49:19,670
I just have to tweet anything else. I I might just write

743
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:23,590
I don't know. I'm writing like oh, hello. I'm

744
02:49:24,549 --> 02:49:27,989
Oh, hi is my tweet. That's uh, wow

745
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:29,670
Uh-huh

746
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:36,709
Tweet about the lakers game

747
02:49:38,790 --> 02:49:43,190
Be like I can't I can't fucking understand what's going on. Just pull out like five random players

748
02:49:43,909 --> 02:49:45,909
And be like, I don't know what fucking happened there

749
02:49:46,309 --> 02:49:48,790
The three pointers tonight from they weren't very good

750
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:11,620
Is that a cannon that thing looks pretty crazy

751
02:50:43,190 --> 02:50:47,270
There it is. Yeah, that's what I want. I I want a cannon. I hope I can get this item

752
02:50:48,069 --> 02:51:07,489
You're saying this is a ps2 game was three still in the ps2 era. That's kind of remarkable if that's

753
02:51:08,129 --> 02:51:11,909
Is that real?

754
02:51:11,909 --> 02:51:15,299
Wow

755
02:51:15,299 --> 02:51:18,819
I it does look like a pia. I was wondering the cutscenes are a little

756
02:51:19,860 --> 02:51:22,100
a little scratchy around the edges

757
02:51:22,819 --> 02:51:27,840
I was wondering

758
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:29,840
I did. Yeah, that's ps2

759
02:51:30,719 --> 02:51:38,579
That's kind of unbelievable

760
02:51:38,579 --> 02:51:40,420
All right. Well, i'm definitely going to try

761
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:50,479
Let's try these

762
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:54,959
All right, i'm gonna buy these until I have no more money left and then turn my power button on my computer off until

763
02:51:54,959 --> 02:51:56,680
I turn it off

764
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:58,680
And then just and just leave

765
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:10,930
All right. I want to test these out

766
02:52:10,930 --> 02:52:19,329
So you put them together

767
02:52:19,329 --> 02:52:23,879
Do they have a backswing move?

768
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:36,799
I guess I could go look right

769
02:52:36,799 --> 02:52:38,799
Okay, so

770
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:51,379
Why why why why why why why pause why why why pause why pause?

771
02:52:51,860 --> 02:53:09,190
Why and then just in midair forward on the stick and why I still have this?

772
02:53:12,739 --> 02:53:15,379
So type three combo is what I have to use this with

773
02:53:15,780 --> 02:53:25,940
So I need to I need to do why pause why pause why why why why why why let's try it

774
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:38,209
That is

775
02:53:43,889 --> 02:53:49,190
When do I start to mash it

776
02:53:50,069 --> 02:53:55,000
After the second pause

777
02:53:55,920 --> 02:54:01,350
My goodness, that's insane

778
02:54:09,329 --> 02:54:13,489
The regular combo is good, too

779
02:54:18,290 --> 02:54:22,530
On second pause why pause why pause

780
02:54:23,489 --> 02:54:33,989
The upgrades make this weapon fun

781
02:54:33,989 --> 02:54:34,950
Okay

782
02:54:34,950 --> 02:54:44,790
Can I move this?

783
02:54:58,370 --> 02:54:59,329
Whoa

784
02:54:59,329 --> 02:55:00,930
Where did those come from?

785
02:55:00,930 --> 02:55:16,469
I don't think I have enough I could try it on jet stream level two

786
02:55:19,409 --> 02:55:21,329
Uh, should I get air hike for this?

787
02:55:21,969 --> 02:55:34,450
Did you tell your mother's happy mother's day? I did passing one trial still shows lacking

788
02:55:34,850 --> 02:55:38,610
Passing two expands horizons passing all three unlocks true potential

789
02:55:41,170 --> 02:55:57,670
Your wisdom we put to the test your technique to the test and then your warrior's heart the test

790
02:55:58,069 --> 02:56:41,569
I'm gonna go here. See how smart I am. That was easy. All right in a game scenario

791
02:56:41,569 --> 02:57:04,950
This is actually hard to do because I think these enemies are just horrible

792
02:57:22,290 --> 02:57:23,090
Yeah

793
02:57:23,090 --> 02:57:50,000
They're all fucking room full of them. I want to start this room over actually. Yeah start over

794
02:57:50,399 --> 02:58:10,440
All right

795
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:31,940
So these have little lit this this is one four and then three one two three four read the hint

796
02:58:32,180 --> 02:58:42,530
Use your lifetime experience from the crawling infant to the man standing tall and finally the old man leaning on his cane

797
02:58:49,700 --> 02:59:20,229
infant tall man old man infant infant

798
02:59:20,549 --> 02:59:40,920
What is in which one of these is an infant? He's already seen it in chat. It's too late. Yeah, it's too late

799
02:59:41,399 --> 02:59:46,690
Yeah, I'm I was pretending to walk around and not know where I was going. I was like, okay

800
02:59:47,829 --> 03:00:01,190
Infant tall man where and i've read it a minute and a half ago at least hey, look at that. There it is

801
03:00:01,670 --> 03:00:34,709
I won't read chat anymore. So I got an m. What is it a blue gem? What is that thing? So I got it

802
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:45,750
So can I just just go wherever? All right, i'm not going to reach half of this one

803
03:00:45,750 --> 03:00:51,010
I'm just going to try to do it overcome the onslaught of obstacles to guarantee your future

804
03:00:51,090 --> 03:01:45,760
All right. All right, so that's when you gotta go like right here. Oh my god. Wait, did those hit me?

805
03:01:48,479 --> 03:02:02,950
Those don't hit me

806
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:13,299
I thought the one's pointing down we're gonna hit I got it

807
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:54,129
I gotta break it. Can I turn this back on and maybe get them hurt?

808
03:02:55,729 --> 03:03:00,209
I hate these fucking flying motherfuckers without I hate them. I hate these things

809
03:03:08,629 --> 03:03:11,510
This is one once I attack one another one's already attacking me

810
03:03:12,799 --> 03:03:14,399
Oh my

811
03:03:14,399 --> 03:03:30,229
I hate these fucking things. I have one

812
03:03:30,850 --> 03:03:56,049
hp and

813
03:03:56,530 --> 03:04:19,579
I already did it that counts. Okay. Does this have anything that I need to read light all the crests

814
03:04:19,899 --> 03:05:29,760
I think this is just a fight dying is actually a speed run strat. That's funny. Okay, let's go. Whoa, look out. Stop walking

815
03:05:30,799 --> 03:05:36,110
Go all this guy doesn't walk

816
03:05:36,110 --> 03:06:16,670
I think I have to turn these on die

817
03:06:17,069 --> 03:07:00,319
I was at s2 shit. Is it on timer? I need to do that move

818
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:10,989
Why pause why pause why pause? I can't pull it off

819
03:07:32,700 --> 03:07:38,780
What the fuck? I'm gonna lose

820
03:07:39,659 --> 03:07:42,379
I have to sit here and practice this move until I can do it without thinking about it

821
03:07:46,670 --> 03:07:48,909
Why pause why pause why pause?

822
03:07:49,629 --> 03:07:57,979
Like that, right?

823
03:07:57,979 --> 03:08:03,040
Why pause what?

824
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:05,840
All right. I have to get this down. Otherwise, i'm just gonna take the weapon off

825
03:08:10,690 --> 03:08:11,969
Why?

826
03:08:11,969 --> 03:08:23,579
It's why why why that's it there, but I I want to do the thing you do you spin him around like crazy

827
03:08:32,139 --> 03:08:46,989
Yeah, why pause why pause why why why why why why what i'm doing won't work. It's longer pauses

828
03:08:48,959 --> 03:08:58,770
Yeah

829
03:08:58,770 --> 03:09:03,889
You're doing why pause why why why pause why pause why why why why why why why

830
03:09:04,290 --> 03:09:37,280
Yeah, but aren't I supposed to mash after the second pause to do the follow-up? I feel like I just did the same thing

831
03:09:53,809 --> 03:10:12,899
All right, so it's okay it's much slower I think I got it let's do it if you're playing at 60 fps

832
03:10:12,899 --> 03:10:15,649
You have to mash really fast. Oh

833
03:10:29,329 --> 03:10:31,329
Is that actually true? Okay

834
03:10:37,729 --> 03:11:17,299
Why pause why pause why why why why why there it is? Oh, that was it

835
03:11:28,100 --> 03:11:30,100
You really don't want to do for that long though. You're just vulnerable

836
03:11:41,309 --> 03:11:54,209
Okay, well, let's go. So I'm I'm I need to light these up, right?

837
03:11:55,790 --> 03:11:58,989
Focusing on trying to learn how to do that move and not play the game

838
03:12:26,850 --> 03:12:28,129
Whoa

839
03:12:28,129 --> 03:12:44,819
All right, let's go

840
03:12:48,940 --> 03:12:49,979
Watch out

841
03:12:49,979 --> 03:13:31,840
Do it. Oh my god. Those guys are fucking horrible. I might die again

842
03:13:41,549 --> 03:14:09,100
Jesus they powered up. I gotta get powered up too then they're invincible unless I spin the wheels

843
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:12,940
That's what I was thinking too. I was like why are these guys so fucking horrible?

844
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:15,489
It has to be something to do with this goddamn wheel

845
03:14:46,159 --> 03:15:33,870
Much better. All right, I think I can't hurt them again. Yep. There we go. I feel much better about this now

846
03:15:34,190 --> 03:16:07,629
All right last part hit it. I'm so paranoid. They're gonna hit me

847
03:16:08,430 --> 03:16:40,979
Okay, be careful here. Oh my god. You are the worst enemy in the fucking game

848
03:16:45,329 --> 03:16:51,889
You're worse than the bat whatever they are the bat thing. Shit didn't do it fast enough

849
03:16:52,930 --> 03:17:04,750
Am I hurting them?

850
03:17:04,750 --> 03:17:05,790
Whoa

851
03:17:05,790 --> 03:17:08,420
Don't get out of the way. I want to hit this thing

852
03:17:20,399 --> 03:17:43,809
Holy shit. That was really really wacky. Somebody said finally ban that person or let's go all in a month

853
03:17:44,049 --> 03:18:06,930
And now what passing one trial still shows lacking. Okay, so I did three right? What do I put them? They go in like a

854
03:18:12,930 --> 03:18:37,329
All right, do I want this on the regular sword? I don't know. These are fun. It's for any weapon

855
03:18:37,489 --> 03:18:47,809
Oh wait, it's for every weapon. Does it carry over? I'll get used to these

856
03:18:47,809 --> 03:18:55,649
I feel like these are gonna be better. I'm sticking with these. I gotta get used to it and maybe it'll be better

857
03:18:56,989 --> 03:19:10,290
All right double jump. Wow, that makes this so much better

858
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:57,340
That's amazing. So I did that put them all in okay a gun of the demon world that discharges arrows

859
03:19:58,379 --> 03:20:26,959
It's a gun. Ooh, i'll try it. Oh, okay

860
03:20:40,079 --> 03:20:42,579
Thank you

861
03:20:42,579 --> 03:20:45,459
The gunslinger gun, otherwise, it's not great

862
03:20:49,090 --> 03:20:59,700
Oh, look at I only have 700 orbs. That's not a lot. I'm playing on trickster

863
03:21:15,600 --> 03:21:23,409
You point a gun at me your own kid

864
03:21:24,700 --> 03:21:29,940
Your dear papa the only family I ever had was my mother

865
03:21:30,899 --> 03:21:32,899
And she's dead

866
03:21:36,079 --> 03:21:38,079
You break my heart

867
03:21:38,479 --> 03:21:40,659
after all

868
03:21:40,659 --> 03:21:42,659
It was I who gave you your name

869
03:21:49,819 --> 03:22:06,129
One day a game or a movie will have that happen but it'll hit him right in the face

870
03:22:06,770 --> 03:22:22,239
Plenty of orbs. I got plenty of orbs

871
03:22:26,159 --> 03:22:28,219
Imagine getting a b

872
03:22:28,219 --> 03:22:31,420
Because you didn't use any items and collected it all the stuff

873
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,000
You got a b for perfect attendance

874
03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:01,020
That's what it feels like

875
03:23:01,020 --> 03:23:03,020
Well, this is my kind of rain

876
03:23:03,889 --> 03:23:07,409
No wonder the sky looks so funny today. Let me go

877
03:23:08,209 --> 03:23:13,459
Let you go, but it would be a waste if you ended up with just a pretty stain

878
03:23:20,020 --> 03:23:28,079
It did happen

879
03:23:28,079 --> 03:23:31,200
Here I am trying to help you and you show your thanks by shooting me

880
03:23:38,559 --> 03:23:40,559
Whatever choose you please

881
03:23:46,139 --> 03:23:48,139
So he's a demon, too

882
03:23:49,889 --> 03:23:52,610
I'm beginning to think i've got rotten luck with women

883
03:23:59,969 --> 03:24:05,729
Okay, uh

884
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:08,879
I try these

885
03:24:08,879 --> 03:24:10,879
I'll give them a try see if they're any good

886
03:24:10,879 --> 03:24:14,909
All right. Let's take a few break. I'll be right back

887
03:24:14,909 --> 03:24:21,979
I'm back in place some more. Did anybody know how how long is this game? The first one was

888
03:24:22,700 --> 03:24:25,200
Like eight hours or so are they all kind of like

889
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:31,760
Seven to ten. It's 20 missions 20 chapters

890
03:24:34,780 --> 03:24:36,750
Just was curious

891
03:24:36,750 --> 03:24:42,079
I will be right back

892
03:24:42,079 --> 03:24:46,159
Uh, I can't really alt tab. So you're gonna have to be left with this on the brb screen. Unfortunately

893
03:24:48,610 --> 03:24:56,270
Oh, well, it didn't matter. I will be will this work? Let's see

894
03:24:56,829 --> 03:29:39,409
All right, i'll be right back. What is going on? What's up?

895
03:29:39,969 --> 03:29:45,229
It's back on

896
03:29:45,229 --> 03:29:48,989
Well now you can hear it

897
03:29:48,989 --> 03:29:59,899
There we go. Oh, I forgot I was supposed I gotta clear my throat before I say anything

898
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:07,379
Hey ordered a dork cube years ago with your promo code or still haven't received it

899
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:14,639
um

900
03:30:14,639 --> 03:30:17,729
Yeah

901
03:30:17,729 --> 03:30:19,889
I don't think I can't afford anything either. So i'm gonna go

902
03:30:28,100 --> 03:30:29,379
Try the new weapon

903
03:30:29,379 --> 03:30:39,840
Can I charge it?

904
03:30:39,840 --> 03:31:21,540
Find out normal shot. I guess not. Yes. It's just a regular shoot weapon. Whoa need to level gunslinger

905
03:31:21,860 --> 03:31:35,389
That would make sense. It's 20 missions in every devil may cry except for one and five

906
03:31:35,549 --> 03:32:01,040
Okay, is the quesadilla just a really thin taco you're asking the real questions tonight, I think no, I don't think so

907
03:32:02,819 --> 03:32:09,790
Sorry, I was reading chat

908
03:32:11,200 --> 03:32:19,629
Wait, whoa. Whoa, there's a lot of stuff down here. Look at this. Look at all these orbs. I gotta get all these

909
03:32:20,030 --> 03:32:42,559
What else is up here?

910
03:32:43,520 --> 03:32:47,360
Just going all the way up

911
03:32:55,120 --> 03:33:09,760
There were at least five people that said to ban that guy i'm also realizing something very important about myself

912
03:33:13,600 --> 03:33:18,079
I need these to be switched and i've been playing for like three and a half hours already

913
03:33:19,579 --> 03:33:39,459
But I have to change this it makes way more sense

914
03:33:40,100 --> 03:33:47,950
I can't believe that guy got banned for a month for what he said

915
03:33:49,420 --> 03:33:50,379
I know

916
03:33:50,379 --> 03:34:37,280
me either attacks. Damn it. Damn it

917
03:34:37,920 --> 03:35:12,299
I wish that staggered you're bad at chess. Yeah, I am. I know that. Oh nice. Hey, did the lakers lose? Uh,

918
03:35:15,170 --> 03:35:30,450
Baby, did they? Oh, what if what if somebody t voted though? I don't want to spoil it for them, right?

919
03:35:30,450 --> 03:36:14,579
If somebody t voted we don't want to they might want to watch it later out of that. That's a lot of people

920
03:36:24,399 --> 03:36:34,750
Dude, come on. I just got full health

921
03:36:44,690 --> 03:36:52,659
You guys are all standing in a good five foot square around each other. I can't get in there

922
03:36:53,219 --> 03:38:34,219
I just went right into it. Watch out. Do jump x jump x jump x. Okay. Those guys had trillion health

923
03:38:40,100 --> 03:38:46,590
secrets

924
03:38:46,590 --> 03:38:50,799
Ah, you can only do the double jump when it's active. That makes sense. I get it

925
03:38:50,959 --> 03:39:00,540
But this bird I thought this person said do you have a super ball under your chair?

926
03:39:00,620 --> 03:39:24,190
I'm trying to figure out what the hell that was supposed to mean magic essence. Oh, I can't get into this one

927
03:39:31,440 --> 03:39:51,229
Damn it. Nice. This is what the elevator is. That's the elevator control power panel

928
03:39:51,549 --> 03:40:25,469
I gotta go put that thing that other gem in that slot. No, that doesn't go there

929
03:40:29,790 --> 03:40:35,969
Tom's flames. Oh, I know what that is. Can I go back to there? There's a door with the fire on it

930
03:40:36,049 --> 03:40:44,459
I think that's where I gotta go. All right, come on

931
03:40:45,020 --> 03:41:17,819
Okay, so

932
03:41:17,899 --> 03:41:55,860
Where is that place? Can I even get back there from here? Okay, I think i'm going the right way now. I hope so

933
03:41:56,500 --> 03:42:19,780
Steam, uh, yeah, this is the pc port part of the hd collection. Honestly, this is my favorite weapon so far

934
03:42:20,659 --> 03:42:35,440
I think it's the best one

935
03:42:37,360 --> 03:42:55,489
Yeah, I like it the most for sure back to the elevator that I was thinking of doing

936
03:42:56,690 --> 03:43:01,040
Will you do anything else besides the third game?

937
03:43:03,440 --> 03:43:06,639
I I probably will just play them all at some point. I have to imagine

938
03:43:07,200 --> 03:43:11,229
They're not particularly long games. Not like it's like oh my god

939
03:43:11,309 --> 03:43:22,959
It's gonna take me like a month to beat it a couple of streams per game probably that makes sense to me

940
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:28,350
All right. So that's a power source for the elevator

941
03:43:41,020 --> 03:43:45,409
Just skip two. I feel like everyone's telling me how bad two is

942
03:43:46,049 --> 03:43:49,489
Everyone's like oh, no, no, no, no, no, you get away from two. Don't play two

943
03:43:50,450 --> 03:43:54,770
I almost want to play it because keep I keep seeing people say such awful things about it

944
03:43:55,329 --> 03:44:02,899
Can I go into two with the mindset of i'm gonna play it for an hour and just not care?

945
03:44:03,700 --> 03:44:05,299
Would that be okay?

946
03:44:05,299 --> 03:44:19,889
And look if I play it and i'm like, holy goodness. This is really awful and i'll just stop playing it. Not a big deal

947
03:44:22,129 --> 03:45:02,620
All right, let's try to get a perfect here well it was there but I screwed it up stop

948
03:45:07,139 --> 03:45:08,739
Oh my goodness

949
03:45:08,739 --> 03:45:26,340
Does this game have any bathroom humor? Um, I don't think so

950
03:45:27,260 --> 03:45:29,540
Maybe no

951
03:45:29,540 --> 03:45:36,739
Is that your criteria for if you're gonna buy the game or not? Where's the bathroom humor, dude?

952
03:45:38,579 --> 03:45:59,620
You're better than this. It's more dad joke humor. I can say that

953
03:46:04,059 --> 03:46:11,819
devil may cry 2 gets boring very quickly once you realize how effective bullet spam is just overall not fun encounters

954
03:46:12,379 --> 03:46:17,940
piece and take

955
03:46:17,940 --> 03:46:26,700
It's a good take I think what's bathroom humor stuff like this like if I were to make a big

956
03:46:27,500 --> 03:46:34,379
From your understanding, why are these games titled devil may cry?

957
03:46:36,780 --> 03:46:39,899
So because i'm dante from dante's inferno

958
03:46:40,909 --> 03:46:44,590
And there's a demon that i'm going after and I am so good

959
03:46:45,569 --> 03:46:48,510
I am so

960
03:46:48,510 --> 03:46:53,469
I'm so talented and i'm so dangerous that the devils are the the devils are afraid of me

961
03:46:54,559 --> 03:46:58,079
So oh dante's coming. Ah, he's gonna kill us

962
03:46:59,040 --> 03:47:01,920
Everybody like that's what I think like devil may cry

963
03:47:05,299 --> 03:47:07,860
Because whoa dante is very scary

964
03:47:16,590 --> 03:47:33,100
That's how i've always viewed this

965
03:47:33,500 --> 03:47:44,829
Let's get in there

966
03:47:57,819 --> 03:48:14,110
And even you can do combos like that if you put your dante's inferno free, okay, I don't think I can

967
03:48:20,530 --> 03:48:22,530
Come on

968
03:48:28,030 --> 03:48:29,549
How do I get out of here

969
03:48:29,549 --> 03:48:31,620
Okay

970
03:48:31,620 --> 03:48:58,270
Oh is actually that I actually had to do that. I would have stuck here for a while. Come on gwen. Come on gwen

971
03:48:59,069 --> 03:49:24,819
I like that. That was a good chat. That was a good message. Did I do it? I don't think I did it

972
03:49:26,420 --> 03:49:28,420
I don't know what I let's do it again

973
03:49:28,579 --> 03:49:49,139
I think if I break the statues that's what I would be doing

974
03:49:55,200 --> 03:49:58,719
Is it not smash into these statues that do I just would break the ball?

975
03:50:27,180 --> 03:50:43,950
It's glowing in fact, I just heard that

976
03:50:47,309 --> 03:50:49,469
That like child laughing sound effect

977
03:50:53,950 --> 03:51:01,920
Oh, I get it. All right, you guys know that the stock laugh sound they're like

978
03:51:02,079 --> 03:51:04,079
Yeah

979
03:51:04,959 --> 03:51:12,350
I can't do it

980
03:51:12,350 --> 03:51:27,700
I'm fine

981
03:51:27,700 --> 03:51:31,379
No, I like I want to see where i'm fucking swinging this thing

982
03:51:32,829 --> 03:51:34,829
How do I get the camera to go this way?

983
03:51:37,329 --> 03:51:44,530
Popular stock sound effect is it there it is

984
03:51:49,809 --> 03:52:01,010
That was it. You've never heard that before. No, no way. You definitely have you just didn't process it

985
03:52:01,329 --> 03:52:13,260
All right, turn the camera

986
03:52:13,260 --> 03:52:15,979
No, stop. I want to face this direction

987
03:52:17,700 --> 03:52:19,459
Dante

988
03:52:19,459 --> 03:52:21,059
Dante, please

989
03:52:21,059 --> 03:53:03,299
Just hit it. I am

990
03:53:04,219 --> 03:53:06,459
It's a it's not a physics puzzle

991
03:53:07,260 --> 03:53:37,420
I'm not supposed to break the statues or break. I was saying that too. What you guys told me I had to break the door

992
03:53:37,659 --> 03:53:39,659
All right. I'm never looking over here again

993
03:53:48,579 --> 03:53:50,579
Oh my god

994
03:53:50,659 --> 03:54:05,040
I don't want to do this again

995
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:28,100
How far away am I right now? What is going on?

996
03:54:32,260 --> 03:54:36,020
Where what's happening right now? What's going on? Where am I? Why did they put me all the way back here?

997
03:54:39,790 --> 03:54:43,229
He asked if it was hard and then a laughing face

998
03:54:47,899 --> 03:55:00,129
Oh, it's over here

999
03:55:00,450 --> 03:55:03,540
This is hard

1000
03:55:03,540 --> 03:55:04,819
Yeah, it is

1001
03:55:04,819 --> 03:55:26,459
Can I just do I have to do any of this? I guess I don't

1002
03:55:28,799 --> 03:55:30,079
Okay

1003
03:55:30,079 --> 03:55:32,079
I'm good. Can I leave? No, I can't I have to be

1004
03:55:32,799 --> 03:55:38,110
And how come they get to queue up a swing during the cutscene and I don't

1005
03:55:40,079 --> 03:55:56,909
Unfair my lord

1006
03:56:11,819 --> 03:56:13,819
Is there a mod to make the lock on better?

1007
03:56:14,850 --> 03:56:28,319
Can I please install one pushing in the stick to change enemies is

1008
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:58,139
Is driving me insane, especially when there's so many enemies in a room to have to switch between

1009
03:56:58,620 --> 03:57:07,600
Having to press the stick in makes me want to throw up one and it and it picks a random fucking person

1010
03:57:08,399 --> 03:57:41,860
What a drama queen. It makes me want to throw up blood. This lock on is so bad. It makes me want to puke blood

1011
03:57:44,030 --> 03:57:56,000
Whoa?

1012
03:57:56,000 --> 03:57:58,000
It he's always so dramatic

1013
03:58:14,610 --> 03:58:16,610
I'm trying to think of any other

1014
03:58:16,690 --> 03:58:21,840
Hold on. This is the only scenario where you can talk like that

1015
03:58:22,899 --> 03:58:26,979
Right. This is the only scenario where you could where that people I mean it was a weird thing that I said

1016
03:58:27,620 --> 03:58:31,780
But in any other scenario, it's like what the fuck is this person talking about?

1017
03:58:32,500 --> 03:58:40,100
Can you imagine going to the doctor and you have like a wart on your finger?

1018
03:58:43,139 --> 03:58:47,780
Hey doctor, I got this ward on my finger. Let me take care of that. I I I can get that ward off

1019
03:58:47,860 --> 03:58:50,049
They're very hard though

1020
03:58:50,129 --> 03:58:51,329
Oh kid

1021
03:58:51,329 --> 03:58:54,930
That's this thing. This thing's really giving us some trouble here. Hold on still. Let me just get that word up

1022
03:58:55,409 --> 03:58:57,889
This is so hard. Just makes me want to fucking puke blood

1023
03:58:58,690 --> 03:59:02,659
It's like, uh, all right

1024
03:59:02,899 --> 03:59:21,299
Didn't you have a ward on your finger? No, it was a gamer boil and I want you to get it right

1025
03:59:51,540 --> 04:00:22,670
Get out of the way

1026
04:00:22,670 --> 04:01:05,700
Oh fuck. Let me out of here. I mean that made me just want to puke blood

1027
04:01:06,659 --> 04:01:28,420
What did I get for doing that? What was it? What was the point of this?

1028
04:01:29,219 --> 04:01:32,290
I got the thing right. What did I just pick up?

1029
04:01:32,850 --> 04:02:04,260
What did I pick up this thing right here? Right now this goes in that other side. It has to back

1030
04:02:04,819 --> 04:02:06,260
up this way

1031
04:02:06,260 --> 04:02:10,059
Back to where the elevator is

1032
04:02:10,059 --> 04:02:18,219
I gotta get these

1033
04:02:18,219 --> 04:02:20,219
It's time finally

1034
04:02:20,219 --> 04:02:23,979
The people that are writing that I just want to make sure you understand

1035
04:02:24,770 --> 04:02:30,780
Um, i'm not going to tolerate it. I mods what I want you to do anybody that says finally

1036
04:02:31,260 --> 04:02:35,180
I'm not going to tolerate it. I would like for you to start timing people out

1037
04:02:35,659 --> 04:02:49,950
For exactly five seconds every time they say that and if they do it again

1038
04:02:50,590 --> 04:02:52,989
Then I want you to time them out again a second time

1039
04:02:55,950 --> 04:02:57,950
All right. I have to play the fucking video game

1040
04:03:01,659 --> 04:03:12,340
I gotta go all the way up. I just keep seeing things shining on hold on. It's the yellow door, right?

1041
04:03:29,139 --> 04:03:34,850
Wait, can I actually

1042
04:03:34,850 --> 04:03:38,659
Can I go this way?

1043
04:03:38,659 --> 04:03:45,340
No, where's that elevator? I kind of just appeared in this room. How do I get out of here over here, right?

1044
04:03:45,819 --> 04:04:17,139
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. The camera was weird. I already got that i'm doing that the hell

1045
04:04:18,450 --> 04:04:20,290
No, this is wrong

1046
04:04:20,290 --> 04:04:22,290
This is wrong. No, it's just right. That's right

1047
04:04:22,770 --> 04:04:45,440
Oh, he does a backswing

1048
04:04:45,440 --> 04:04:53,500
one two three

1049
04:05:07,840 --> 04:05:26,909
Oh shit rematch

1050
04:05:39,409 --> 04:05:42,530
How do you pull off a guard break or does it just a certain amount of damage when they're guarding

1051
04:05:42,930 --> 04:06:18,059
Oh, that does not work here. Yeah

1052
04:06:18,780 --> 04:06:57,120
10 000 why are you attacking him when he did nothing wrong? I had to

1053
04:06:57,600 --> 04:07:01,120
Hey, sorry, I had to fuck him up, okay

1054
04:07:26,079 --> 04:07:54,860
Oh, this is weird. Oh, it's worth doing anything right now. Probably not

1055
04:08:11,680 --> 04:08:16,500
Yeah, it's all right. You probably need to be a gun specialist to care about it

1056
04:08:16,979 --> 04:08:26,110
All right. This is the one here. It's definitely a boss. Am I happy with this?

1057
04:08:27,229 --> 04:08:29,659
I like the nunchucks

1058
04:08:29,739 --> 04:08:44,350
Yeah

1059
04:08:44,350 --> 04:08:56,700
Get streamed level two

1060
04:08:57,100 --> 04:09:30,479
I'm not doing anything. Not yet kind of scared. What's through this door? Let's find out. This is the fight

1061
04:09:59,809 --> 04:10:07,219
You showed up

1062
04:10:07,219 --> 04:10:10,350
You sure know how to throw a party. No food

1063
04:10:10,909 --> 04:10:13,340
No drinks

1064
04:10:13,340 --> 04:10:15,340
And the only babe just left

1065
04:10:16,139 --> 04:10:18,139
my sincerest apology

1066
04:10:18,940 --> 04:10:21,629
I was so eager to see you

1067
04:10:21,790 --> 04:10:25,469
Somebody said well time to puke blood. Am I gonna get mad?

1068
04:10:26,430 --> 04:10:36,559
Uh-oh at any rate it's been a whole year since we last met kiss from your little brother kiss from this

1069
04:10:37,440 --> 04:10:45,750
This is what they call a heartwarming family reunion

1070
04:11:39,540 --> 04:12:33,219
I got this die

1071
04:12:39,709 --> 04:12:41,309
Yeah

1072
04:12:41,309 --> 04:12:52,430
I'm getting crossed up because I changed the this is what happens when this just this just kill me just kill me

1073
04:12:52,430 --> 04:12:54,690
Let me explain

1074
04:12:54,690 --> 04:12:57,309
Uh, let me explain

1075
04:12:57,389 --> 04:12:59,389
So the leftmost button

1076
04:12:59,709 --> 04:13:01,969
Can we all agree?

1077
04:13:01,969 --> 04:13:03,889
the leftmost button

1078
04:13:03,889 --> 04:13:09,090
Of the face buttons i'm talking ab x y whatever the leftmost button

1079
04:13:09,729 --> 04:13:14,049
Should always be attacked right like just like swing weapon always

1080
04:13:15,180 --> 04:13:16,540
It wasn't that

1081
04:13:16,540 --> 04:13:19,180
I halfway through the stream changed it to that

1082
04:13:20,139 --> 04:13:23,899
And now i'm getting crossed up shooting when i'm swinging and I should have just done it

1083
04:13:23,899 --> 04:13:25,899
I should have fixed it in the very beginning

1084
04:14:17,010 --> 04:14:21,170
X x x it's not y to attack. It's x it hit x

1085
04:14:21,649 --> 04:14:26,530
Sometimes i'll be like jump y it's like why did you do that blood?

1086
04:14:27,170 --> 04:14:37,020
Imagine you imagine saying that

1087
04:14:38,350 --> 04:14:42,030
You you you blood you go blood. Oh blood

1088
04:14:45,379 --> 04:15:50,399
That wasn't even a good one. That one sucked. My goodness gracious. Where's it? Where is it?

1089
04:15:50,479 --> 04:15:54,239
How do I just do it again? Where's the how do I hold down like r to restart?

1090
04:16:28,030 --> 04:16:40,510
All right, I got it

1091
04:16:40,510 --> 04:17:36,430
How did you hit me from all the way over here?

1092
04:17:36,430 --> 04:18:29,739
Oh shoot him. Yeah

1093
04:18:37,600 --> 04:18:39,600
Oh blood

1094
04:19:01,899 --> 04:19:09,569
You refused to gain power the power of our father sparta father

1095
04:19:12,209 --> 04:19:16,940
I don't have a father

1096
04:19:17,020 --> 04:19:19,020
I just don't like you. That's all

1097
04:19:35,489 --> 04:19:38,370
Oh, oh we saw this

1098
04:19:40,879 --> 04:19:53,940
Foolish fight controls everything and without strength you cannot protect

1099
04:20:23,159 --> 04:20:56,559
Back both arms out the spell spartacast will be broken. That's not the end of the game. So what happened?

1100
04:21:12,879 --> 04:21:16,239
We should leave for the most we have all that we need

1101
04:21:35,319 --> 04:21:39,620
Wait, we're not done yet. We have what we need plus he still hasn't done

1102

Shine the light against the mirror and point that mirror at a different mirror

1103
04:21:45,139 --> 04:21:47,139

1104
04:21:47,219 --> 04:21:48,739

Fucking room yet

1106
04:22:00,739 --> 04:22:08,479
Lucifer spoilers, I got that so wrong. It's not even funny

1107
04:22:23,190 --> 04:22:26,129
All right

1108
04:22:27,760 --> 04:22:31,079
Oh

1109
04:22:31,079 --> 04:22:32,360

1110
04:22:32,360 --> 04:22:34,360

Why don't you fight like this too hard, huh, okay

1115
04:25:28,450 --> 04:25:46,440
Intrigued i'll keep what I got. I kind of want to upgrade these though. I'm doing it

1116
04:25:57,409 --> 04:25:58,690
At least once

1117
04:25:58,690 --> 04:26:02,790
I might even do it twice

1118
04:26:02,790 --> 04:26:03,909
That probably was

1119
04:26:03,909 --> 04:26:07,670
Insane what I just did you probably just are you can't believe what just happened

1120
04:26:09,860 --> 04:26:20,840
i'm doing it

1121
04:26:20,840 --> 04:26:22,840
How is this still level one?

1122
04:26:23,239 --> 04:26:26,180
I'm still level one

1123
04:26:26,180 --> 04:26:35,329
I gotta get to level two

1124
04:26:47,059 --> 04:26:51,809

Knock it off. I have not heard knock it off

1132
04:27:58,659 --> 04:28:03,649
Knock it off. That's I've not heard that in a very long time

1133
04:28:05,399 --> 04:28:09,399
That's like the like the boys are over for a sleepover and we're talking a little too loud

1134
04:28:10,239 --> 04:28:15,680
And your mom, you know come it's kind of late you hear it. Hey knock it off boys

1135
04:28:16,450 --> 04:28:33,270
Um, okay. Okay, that's the knock it off. It's getting late. Ow, knock it off. I love that

1136
04:28:33,750 --> 04:28:35,569
I'm gonna start using that

1137
04:28:35,569 --> 04:28:56,290
Where the rest of this is open?

1138
04:28:59,989 --> 04:29:02,280
Hey settle down

1139
04:29:02,280 --> 04:29:38,680
Settle down eight settle down. Oh, just don't fall off

1140
04:29:39,319 --> 04:30:41,270
I can't hurt think I have to knock it off knock it off. Okay, the issue that i'm seeing here is

1141
04:30:41,829 --> 04:31:12,079
What was that move that I just did?

1142
04:31:12,399 --> 04:31:15,440
Okay, what I just I tried to hold it I can

1143
04:31:16,319 --> 04:31:18,319
I got like knocked out of it

1144
04:31:18,959 --> 04:31:20,959
I held it down and it didn't do anything

1145
04:31:20,959 --> 04:31:37,440
Oh

1146
04:31:37,440 --> 04:31:44,959
What?

1147
04:31:44,959 --> 04:31:50,840
Is that good?

1148
04:31:50,840 --> 04:31:53,959
Uh, this is a secret mission and I don't really want to do it

1149
04:31:59,860 --> 04:32:02,819
What? Okay. I'm pressing do I have to have three to turn it on?

1150
04:32:02,819 --> 04:32:05,459
How can I do it with one do I have to have all three turned on?

1151
04:32:06,100 --> 04:32:10,129
Okay, so all three have to be activated

1152
04:32:10,290 --> 04:32:12,530
It's the only way I can hurt anybody

1153
04:32:12,530 --> 04:32:27,829
This mission is awful and so you're really powered up

1154
04:32:28,469 --> 04:32:29,510
Yeah

1155
04:32:29,510 --> 04:32:37,639
How do I just i'm gonna die

1156
04:32:37,639 --> 04:33:18,979
Let's wait. Yeah. Yeah, kill me kill me. All right. Well, i'm not doing that one. It seemed pretty painful

1157
04:33:21,250 --> 04:33:30,770
I get up here. I think I can get up here

1158
04:33:37,479 --> 04:33:57,220
This is where I started or something. All right, there's one more of those things. Where is it?

1159
04:34:28,229 --> 04:34:40,840
The second door over here

1160
04:34:41,159 --> 04:34:48,689
This is where I came from

1161
04:34:49,330 --> 04:34:54,520
I have no idea where this is

1162
04:35:01,090 --> 04:35:12,849
I have to break it. Is he trolling?

1163
04:35:14,790 --> 04:35:16,950
No

1164
04:35:16,950 --> 04:35:18,950
Where do I even go?

1165
04:35:23,040 --> 04:35:32,419
Didn't I in the cave? Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't just in here. Yeah, I hit this one

1166
04:35:33,060 --> 04:35:35,240
And then I went this way and I couldn't go anywhere else

1167
04:35:41,590 --> 04:35:43,029
I can get off here

1168
04:35:43,029 --> 04:35:44,389
All right

1169
04:35:44,389 --> 04:36:27,270
What the heck? I wish I could move the camera so bad. I feel like uh, look he too is behind me

1170
04:36:30,099 --> 04:37:01,330
Anybody knows what I mean by that? What is that? I spent all my money on uh,

1171
04:37:02,049 --> 04:37:03,639
on

1172
04:37:03,639 --> 04:37:29,479
frivolous things that I didn't need oh dear this does not look good an organ rides ferociously on the other side of the

1173
04:37:30,259 --> 04:37:45,970
Membranous wall can't get any closer. Oh, yeah scared the shit out of me

1174
04:37:53,669 --> 04:37:55,669

1175
04:37:57,430 --> 04:37:58,790
Come on

1176
04:37:58,790 --> 04:38:30,979
What? Hey, he just got whacked

1177
04:39:05,479 --> 04:39:07,479
Probably stinks in here

1178
04:39:07,639 --> 04:39:09,639
Yeah

1179
04:39:09,880 --> 04:39:13,000
Yeah, I would I would I would almost said I would hope so

1180
04:39:14,119 --> 04:39:52,880
I just got triple s. I've seen that before

1181
04:39:57,509 --> 04:40:35,060
All right. I think this is the big scary boss part. This is a weird zone when they cry

1182
04:41:02,500 --> 04:41:14,520
Come on man, let's go

1183
04:41:20,290 --> 04:41:36,130

1185
04:42:00,020 --> 04:42:23,619
People here now

1186
04:42:32,680 --> 04:42:50,159
Oh wait, I forget it's all dark now. It's a hundred. I don't know where I am. I think we're on the right way. Yes

1187
04:42:55,479 --> 04:43:10,479
Wait, no, I was told not to buy items. That would make me bad

1188
04:44:01,750 --> 04:44:03,909
Oh the combo was going so strong, too

1189
04:44:15,990 --> 04:45:00,580
Let's go

1190
04:45:00,580 --> 04:45:44,419
Shit, uh, my face is itchy open

1191
04:45:44,900 --> 04:46:56,369
Stop. Oh shit. Oh, he's just gone. This one's more about patience than anything else style up

1192
04:46:57,540 --> 04:47:05,110
Oh, whoa, what I do. Oh, okay. Cool. I can dash twice

1193
04:47:43,680 --> 04:47:51,330
Can I break through this if I hit it enough times or no, I got that I heard it

1194
04:47:53,889 --> 04:47:58,049
Can you read germa how am I supposed to read the chat and look over here at the same time?

1195
04:48:14,979 --> 04:48:26,369
Chat read what am I supposed to be reading? There's no text on the screen a little crazy

1196
04:48:39,009 --> 04:48:43,490
Uh, I need to just kill me

1197
04:48:43,650 --> 04:49:13,560
I wonder should I kill both left and right first or no?

1198
04:49:41,750 --> 04:49:49,889
No, I gotta clear the enemies out. That's too many

1199
04:50:13,860 --> 04:50:18,919

Break it break it. Oh, yes. All right, let's go. Nice a foundation that brought out

1203
04:53:16,580 --> 04:53:20,630
The right one has less health I think the weapon was a little more tanky

1204
04:53:26,720 --> 04:53:32,720
Rage and agonies of the people those who were confined here

1205
04:53:33,520 --> 04:53:37,240
With their desires for evil being unfulfilled

1206
04:53:38,819 --> 04:53:45,490
It was all because sparta slapped stealing devil trigger the world in their faces

1207
04:53:46,529 --> 04:53:56,919
What's wrong?

1208
04:53:56,919 --> 04:54:02,419

1213
04:54:26,240 --> 04:54:27,520
All right

1214
04:54:27,520 --> 04:54:32,630
Haven't seen an a stylus yet

1215
04:54:36,740 --> 04:54:39,720
So much how am I so bad with damage though?

1216
04:54:42,419 --> 04:54:58,470
Damage at a d

1217
04:54:58,470 --> 04:55:00,470
Oh, it's how much damage i'm taking

1218
04:55:01,110 --> 04:55:09,590
That's like 50 000 damage. That sounds like a lot man. That's how much i've been taking

1219
04:56:04,639 --> 04:56:06,639
I would want to be friends with leviathan

1220
04:56:08,150 --> 04:56:14,180
How would I do that?

1221
04:56:14,180 --> 04:56:16,180
So this is the next stage

1222
04:56:16,659 --> 04:56:18,709
wait

1223
04:56:18,709 --> 04:56:20,709
If you're asking for a date

1224
04:56:22,529 --> 04:56:26,689
Forget it because I make it a point not to go out with women who shoot me in the head

1225
04:56:27,490 --> 04:56:29,490
Date a demon

1226
04:56:29,889 --> 04:56:31,889
I'm not that desperate

1227
04:56:31,889 --> 04:56:35,729
Besides, I really don't care for guys who stink like blood

1228
04:56:41,520 --> 04:56:43,520
You're right

1229
04:56:53,430 --> 04:56:58,549
Then what should I call you I don't care whatever you want whatever lady

1230
04:57:03,619 --> 04:57:05,619
I'll leave this to you

1231
04:57:05,779 --> 04:57:07,779
Because I don't want to miss the party

1232
04:57:23,400 --> 04:57:24,759
I'm gonna eat

1233
04:57:24,759 --> 04:57:27,000
I know i'm gonna call them souls, but that's the way it is

1234
04:57:34,400 --> 04:57:38,369
I want it. This is the

1235
04:57:40,849 --> 04:57:59,189
I don't care. I want it. This is my favorite weapon. So I have a question if my favorite weapon

1236
04:57:59,909 --> 04:58:02,150
Are currently it's the nunchucks

1237
04:58:02,150 --> 04:58:03,970
Should I

1238
04:58:03,970 --> 04:58:07,970
Do sword master will I get more if I do sword master trickster is good, but

1239
04:58:16,000 --> 04:58:18,000
You can jump cancel with level two

1240
04:58:18,799 --> 04:58:24,599
High energy stream

1241
04:58:24,599 --> 04:58:26,900
This is the lower energy stream

1242
04:58:27,459 --> 04:58:30,599
You're gonna have to level it up. Uh

1243
04:58:32,720 --> 04:58:34,959
Yeah, that's true. I'll stick with trickster. No

1244
04:58:35,599 --> 04:58:47,349
The game is very high energy

1245
04:58:47,349 --> 04:58:51,319
Yeah, but as long as I can turn

1246
04:58:51,959 --> 04:58:53,959
I don't know if I can turn my brain off

1247
04:58:54,790 --> 04:58:57,270
And focus a lot of times I usually can do okay

1248
04:58:58,689 --> 04:59:00,689
I mean d is still passing great

1249
04:59:00,930 --> 04:59:11,400
The time is there right now 11. Okay, maybe at the end of this section. I'll call over tonight. That'll get us on

1250
04:59:13,200 --> 04:59:20,439
Chapter 10, which is essentially perfectly halfway. I think that makes sense

1251
04:59:36,869 --> 04:59:44,930
Oh

1252
04:59:44,930 --> 04:59:48,229
They're not okay. They're not that bad. They're not as bad as I thought they were gonna be

1253
04:59:49,959 --> 04:59:51,959
They're still kind of weird, but whatever

1254
04:59:52,200 --> 05:00:11,959
I think it's way better now

1255
05:00:42,290 --> 05:00:44,689
Don't okay, it says there's a little wind up there

1256
05:00:45,569 --> 05:01:15,720
One more where is it? Is virgil playable? I would imagine

1257
05:01:16,279 --> 05:01:37,439
The answer to that question is yes. I don't know though. Wait, is that a mirror shine the light mirror?

1258
05:01:37,759 --> 05:01:45,430
Puzzle is that is that actually here? Is this for real? This is really in here

1259
05:01:48,119 --> 05:01:55,860
Oh, well, all right cool

1260
05:01:55,860 --> 05:02:04,610
Radiate the image sunken in the depths below to open a new path. It is a spin the mirror puzzle

1261
05:02:07,619 --> 05:02:16,119
How do I spin it?

1262
05:02:36,290 --> 05:02:56,709
How do I turn them oh I get it

1263
05:03:00,159 --> 05:03:11,349
He needs to use critical thinking skills. Yeah, but I thought that was I didn't know if there was a tilt button or something

1264
05:03:11,590 --> 05:03:21,959
Hit b on stuff. What does it even do for me? I got no money

1265
05:03:46,069 --> 05:04:04,389
Oh, I cannot go that way. What's for breakfast two sausage patties. Yep

1266
05:04:05,110 --> 05:04:07,409
two sausage patties and

1267
05:04:08,369 --> 05:04:29,779
Breakfast sausage patties by the way, one fried egg three four pieces of pineapple

1268
05:04:40,200 --> 05:04:53,860
Over medium. I don't like over easy. All right, so a few pieces of pineapple two

1269
05:04:55,360 --> 05:05:16,080
Sausage patties one egg could be all right. Well, these things hurt you on the edge

1270
05:05:29,720 --> 05:05:32,680
Ooh

1271
05:05:32,680 --> 05:05:50,150
You can extend that

1272
05:05:50,150 --> 05:05:55,240
Actually, I like hard-boiled eggs, but I don't like them after a day. I used to eat them all the time

1273
05:05:56,880 --> 05:05:58,959
I would make a dozen eggs. I'd get a carton of eggs

1274
05:05:59,360 --> 05:06:04,069
And hard boil all of them and I would eat two or three of them every single day for breakfast

1275
05:06:04,709 --> 05:06:09,270
And then sometimes I'd have another one or two later. This is when I was lifting because then I was going to the gym all the time

1276
05:06:10,150 --> 05:06:14,520
Uh, I would eat a lot of eggs and a lot of tuna fish. I used to eat tuna out of the can

1277
05:06:15,959 --> 05:06:20,130
as a snack, I would go to the gym and

1278
05:06:20,689 --> 05:06:21,970
I would do

1279
05:06:21,970 --> 05:06:23,409
You know

1280
05:06:23,409 --> 05:06:25,409
Backed and biceps, right?

1281
05:06:26,849 --> 05:06:29,009
And then I would eat a can of tuna

1282
05:06:29,729 --> 05:06:31,490
When I just got back

1283
05:06:31,490 --> 05:06:41,799
Why do you meal prep hard-boiled eggs?

1284
05:06:42,959 --> 05:06:48,880
Hard-boiled eggs are awesome for meal prep. They're great. They go with tons of stuff. They're really good

1285
05:06:54,080 --> 05:06:57,279
Not cooked and hard-boiled egg is boiled

1286
05:06:58,240 --> 05:07:00,630
boiled egg

1287
05:07:00,630 --> 05:07:03,990
Stop lying. I'm not I've talked about this like in an old video

1288
05:07:04,869 --> 05:07:06,869
From like almost 10 years ago

1289
05:07:09,349 --> 05:07:11,349
anchovies, I I

1290
05:07:11,430 --> 05:07:13,860
You know what? I talked about this a lot

1291
05:07:15,360 --> 05:07:24,159
Anchovies not anchovies sardines sardines are really really good

1292
05:07:25,349 --> 05:07:27,349
If you can get over

1293
05:07:27,430 --> 05:07:30,869
What what it is you're doing right? You're eating they're just in a can

1294
05:07:31,430 --> 05:07:41,080
Did I just walk backwards while talking?

1295
05:07:42,200 --> 05:07:46,159
Oh, there it is ambrosia

1296
05:07:46,759 --> 05:07:50,759
The most delicious of the gods the most dessert that only the gods eat

1297
05:07:52,360 --> 05:07:55,240
Fruits covered in whipped cream and fucking marshmallows

1298
05:07:56,259 --> 05:07:58,259
Only the gods will eat this

1299
05:07:59,639 --> 05:08:02,439
And make sure make sure it's been sitting out for at least 12 hours

1300
05:08:03,000 --> 05:08:12,599
And by the way, even when you put it in the fridge in three or four days go by

1301
05:08:13,240 --> 05:08:18,200
Take it out of the container and just it's the same. It doesn't matter. We'll eat it a week later

1302
05:08:19,080 --> 05:08:33,430
for the gods though

1303
05:08:33,430 --> 05:08:35,430
little candied marshmallows

1304
05:08:51,860 --> 05:09:14,869
The mucky bag turn it on quick. You can pick it

1305
05:09:19,810 --> 05:09:39,490
Oh no

1306
05:09:39,490 --> 05:09:41,490
If you can get to an s rank combo, I will

1307
05:09:41,970 --> 05:09:47,000
Well, i'm gonna i'm not gonna read the first part but I want to tell you that i've done that probably 30 times already

1308
05:09:47,080 --> 05:09:58,979
So that's gonna happen. Oh, I want to try something. Can we try something weird?

1309
05:09:59,220 --> 05:10:02,450
That's gonna take some effort here. I want to try something

1310
05:10:06,599 --> 05:10:14,040
So this is a fun experiment that I've wanted to try for a little while. It doesn't work to this music though

1311
05:10:14,200 --> 05:10:16,200
It needs to be a little more relaxing

1312
05:10:17,360 --> 05:10:20,369
I want the mods to

1313
05:10:21,150 --> 05:10:23,029
record

1314
05:10:23,029 --> 05:10:23,830
with

1315
05:10:23,830 --> 05:10:27,270
You know to log all the responses and i'm curious if there's a

1316
05:10:28,389 --> 05:10:31,590
i'm curious if everybody sort of has something that they really care about

1317
05:10:32,150 --> 05:10:34,150
Or something that they really want right now

1318
05:10:34,389 --> 05:10:36,389
and without thinking

1319
05:10:37,029 --> 05:10:39,750
But what the fuck what the fuck? No, no, no, no, stop. Stop. Listen

1320
05:10:40,389 --> 05:10:42,549
Like this music is speech jamming me. Hold on. It's like

1321
05:10:43,349 --> 05:10:45,349
I hold on. Let me turn this off

1322
05:10:50,290 --> 05:10:54,369
So when we think i'm i'm gonna say something and I want after I say this

1323
05:10:54,369 --> 05:10:56,770
I want the mods to keep a record of what everybody says

1324
05:10:57,750 --> 05:11:05,779
Yeah, just like oh what just what everybody's saying after when I say this I want everybody to right now

1325
05:11:06,840 --> 05:11:08,319
think of

1326
05:11:08,319 --> 05:11:12,319
So something that you a food item it could be a snack

1327
05:11:12,479 --> 05:11:20,229
It could be a dessert something that you want right now so bad that you're craving right now that you

1328
05:11:20,869 --> 05:11:25,830
Not your favorite food, but just what do you want right now? What would just do it for you right now?

1329
05:11:25,909 --> 05:11:36,840
What would be that thing that would do it for you right now? Cool. Yeah, not your favorite food

1330
05:11:36,919 --> 05:11:40,659
Not oh, well my top 10 just you know do this for me right now

1331
05:11:44,419 --> 05:11:49,750
In an italian sub just a cold italian sub. I want it so bad

1332
05:11:54,759 --> 05:12:01,569
It's interesting the reason the reason why I wanted to do this is because i'm curious as to how many people here

1333
05:12:02,049 --> 05:12:04,049
Have the exact same

1334
05:12:04,189 --> 05:12:15,159
Omega craving right now. Do you know what i'm saying? Because that that that's cool

1335
05:12:19,000 --> 05:12:21,490
How do you want us to log this?

1336
05:12:21,490 --> 05:12:30,709
Um, yeah, I just copy and pasted me and and did you have something that's let's say you like man

1337
05:12:30,709 --> 05:12:32,549
This is really specific, but I really want it

1338
05:12:32,549 --> 05:12:38,919
Uh, I want a piece of baklava right now and it did more than three or four people say baklava

1339
05:12:38,919 --> 05:12:48,560
Because holy shit look at that. That's a pretty interesting connection. I thought about it because it's

1340
05:12:49,360 --> 05:12:55,650
Food is one of those things where you get these cravings. But what what right now? What do you want?

1341
05:12:55,970 --> 05:13:01,520
Somebody's like for instance somebody said everything bagel. That's a perfect example of this experiment

1342
05:13:03,700 --> 05:13:10,180
Was there anybody else that said everything bagel put it on a spreadsheet

1343
05:13:10,340 --> 05:13:11,759
Yeah

1344
05:13:11,759 --> 05:13:20,340
Yeah, let's get on a spreadsheet and then i'm gonna go over it on stream the next time and how many people said certain things?

1345
05:13:21,169 --> 05:13:23,349
Does pizza have a hundred?

1346
05:13:23,830 --> 05:13:31,119
Does pepperoni pizza have ten and what had the most what had the least don't really need usernames?

1347
05:13:31,360 --> 05:13:41,090
But the specific thing that really specific thing that you wanted right now. I'm curious. We'll see how it works

1348
05:13:46,919 --> 05:13:58,560
You know what else I want to do I here's another interesting thing going over your steam game library

1349
05:13:59,919 --> 05:14:05,520
In alphabetical order now i'm one of those people that has I have a lot of steam games

1350
05:14:06,080 --> 05:14:09,279
I've had a ton of steam games pretty much every game you've ever seen me play

1351
05:14:09,939 --> 05:14:16,520
On video or on stream whatever right but a lot of them are not a lot of them weren't but go alphabetical on steam

1352
05:14:18,869 --> 05:14:22,950
And pick out every single game that you've ever bought that you ever kept

1353
05:14:24,209 --> 05:14:29,860
Why like how did you feel when you played that game? Why did you buy it?

1354
05:14:30,360 --> 05:14:31,479
What did you think of it?

1355
05:14:31,479 --> 05:14:38,979
Because there's a lot of weird just random shit that I think a lot of people have bought and did you beat it?

1356
05:14:39,459 --> 05:14:49,959
Why didn't you? I think that's fun. I have like 200 games to laugh my ass off. Yeah, that's kind of cool

1357
05:14:54,119 --> 05:14:56,040
Did you start a google survey? Well, I don't want no no

1358
05:14:56,040 --> 05:14:57,479
I don't want you guys to all do this

1359
05:14:57,479 --> 05:15:01,720
I'm just saying maybe I think it might be fun to do that on stream one day and just go over them

1360
05:15:06,819 --> 05:15:09,409
I have 800 games. Well

1361
05:15:10,479 --> 05:15:11,439
It'll take you a while

1362
05:15:11,439 --> 05:15:16,049
But don't you think it's kind of interesting to go back and kind of look at especially if you have a steam account that's been

1363
05:15:16,950 --> 05:15:19,189
More than a few years five plus ten plus years old

1364
05:15:20,659 --> 05:15:24,740
You get to sort of look back and be like what the what the fuck was I thinking back then?

1365
05:15:25,619 --> 05:15:28,580
What was the reason why I bought this and did I get what I wanted out of it?

1366
05:15:28,819 --> 05:15:36,709
I think it's interesting to do that or even like how do you feel even looking at the name of that game?

1367
05:15:37,169 --> 05:15:49,650
Nostalgia trip. Yeah, because I could we'll do one right now like devil may cry three

1368
05:15:50,529 --> 05:15:53,569
Okay, it's a game that I got because I knew I wanted to play devil may cry

1369
05:15:54,680 --> 05:15:59,400
Uh, it was a fun hack and slash game. I never played devil may cry and it was interesting

1370
05:15:59,400 --> 05:16:01,000
I started with the third one

1371
05:16:01,000 --> 05:16:05,639
And that's where I stopped because I never played any of these other games ever again and I uninstalled this one

1372
05:16:06,439 --> 05:16:09,860
Um at the end of this stream, which is really interesting that I did that

1373
05:16:10,680 --> 05:16:15,619
Um makes you kind of think about how you approach things in the future

1374
05:16:25,729 --> 05:16:28,049
Surprise pop quiz. All right. Well, maybe I need to look

1375

1379
05:16:52,930 --> 05:16:54,930
There you go. Exactly

1380
05:16:55,799 --> 05:16:59,560
Thank you for proving why the experiment is an interesting thing to do

1381
05:17:00,659 --> 05:17:04,259
Look at that and didn't you do what? How does that make you feel?

1382
05:17:04,979 --> 05:17:07,799
Isn't that like interesting?

1383
05:17:07,799 --> 05:17:09,319

05:17:09,319 --> 05:17:11,240
I'm walk. All right. I

1385
05:17:11,240 --> 05:17:20,360
Am I going the right way or i'm just being an idiot?

1386
05:17:21,080 --> 05:17:29,840
Did you just discover introspection?

1387
05:17:31,220 --> 05:17:35,459
No, but when was the last time you looked at a steam game that you bought like eight years ago?

1388
05:17:37,970 --> 05:17:39,970
I I mean it's been a while

1389
05:17:46,020 --> 05:17:56,400

1393
05:18:10,200 --> 05:18:15,880
How did I feel when I downloaded this one? Hmm. What was I doing? What was I thinking?

1394
05:18:17,639 --> 05:18:19,080
Maybe

1395
05:18:19,159 --> 05:18:20,919
I guess this one was

1396
05:18:20,919 --> 05:18:23,240
Because I really wanted to work it, you know

1397
05:18:24,360 --> 05:18:26,360
Have a little bit of me time

1398
05:18:26,360 --> 05:18:28,919

1407
05:19:30,610 --> 05:19:36,049
The other people that weren't here

1408
05:19:37,520 --> 05:19:41,599

1531
05:45:52,819 --> 05:45:57,060
Now that the final door is open I have no use for you

1532
05:46:09,810 --> 05:46:12,049
There we go mission 10

1533
05:46:12,919 --> 05:46:17,520
All right, and that's what we'll call it that is where we will call it

1534
05:46:22,849 --> 05:46:24,849
Uh, yeah, we'll figure it out. I

1535
05:46:25,330 --> 05:46:33,439
We'll have the mods are already reaching out to people just a fun little thing. That doesn't not like a running like a contest or anything

1536
05:46:33,520 --> 05:46:35,330
right, it's just

1537
05:46:35,330 --> 05:46:37,330
Decided hey, fuck it. Let's do it

1538
05:46:41,520 --> 05:46:44,880
You got another 30 minutes in yet? Uh, no, it's midnight

1539
05:46:45,520 --> 05:46:59,669
I think I think it's probably time to call it off mischief makers. Did I win?

1540
05:47:01,830 --> 05:47:03,349
I'm sorry

1541
05:47:03,349 --> 05:47:05,590
But it is when?

1542
05:47:05,750 --> 05:47:11,880
It is when we could see it in the chat. It is when we could see it in the chat room over was first

1543
05:47:12,279 --> 05:47:23,569
Can you give us a good night?

1544
05:47:23,569 --> 05:47:32,049
Uh, yeah, I like these no cam streams

1545
05:47:34,479 --> 05:47:40,000
Yeah, I i'm telling you i'm there's a i'm there's a new philosophy here where I just i'm gonna just do whatever I want

1546
05:47:43,650 --> 05:47:48,310
Right. Sometimes it's gonna be devil maker eyes might be something else random then

1547
05:47:49,779 --> 05:47:51,779
Just hang out and play just chill

1548
05:47:54,529 --> 05:47:58,529
I much prefer being able to do stuff like this more often way more often

1549
05:48:01,139 --> 05:48:07,200
So more of these you've already seen a bunch from already, but we're going to continue to do these

1550
05:48:13,349 --> 05:48:17,110
So let's talk about the next stream. I'm going to finish devil may cry 3

1551
05:48:19,279 --> 05:48:24,759
I will be live on friday and we'll probably do friday and

1552
05:48:25,750 --> 05:48:34,119
Probably friday saturday or friday sunday. I'll pick out a couple of days this weekend here friday sunday friday saturday

1553
05:48:37,080 --> 05:48:38,360
We will finish

1554
05:48:38,360 --> 05:48:41,330
devil may cry 3

1555
05:48:41,330 --> 05:48:43,889
And then on either saturday or sunday, we will move on to

1556
05:48:44,610 --> 05:48:52,130
I don't know. I got a list of a bunch of stuff. This game was on a list

1557
05:48:52,130 --> 05:48:58,740
Yeah, it was on my list all the devil may cries were. Oh, yeah the food result thing

1558
05:48:58,740 --> 05:49:11,889
I want to go over that on um on friday, too. I think we got we got everybody. All right

1559
05:49:11,889 --> 05:49:13,650
I think we got everybody that

1560
05:49:13,650 --> 05:49:14,369
um

1561
05:49:14,369 --> 05:49:19,439
Said the the name of the thing that I was saying the food thing is going to be a challenge

1562
05:49:19,840 --> 05:49:28,529
Maybe we just dump it in like a word file. It doesn't matter. All right, i'll see you guys later

1563
05:49:30,000 --> 05:49:32,180
If you stayed up late, have a good night

1564
05:49:32,580 --> 05:49:40,209
If you're just waking up have a good morning and if it's in the middle of the afternoon

1565
05:49:40,610 --> 05:49:57,240
Then get up and stretch and that's it. See you guys on friday

1566
05:49:57,799 --> 05:50:02,479
Great rest of your night. Thanks for watching devil may cry 3

1567
05:50:03,040 --> 05:50:11,720
Very hard, but I get it. I get it. So let me ask you this

1568
05:50:11,799 --> 05:50:17,400
I know a lot of people here are probably big fans of this game. What's the best devil may cry in your opinion?

1569
05:50:17,880 --> 05:50:23,220
What is the is it this one? Is it five the three five?

1570
05:50:24,159 --> 05:50:41,919
One there was a lot of debate in the pre-stream of is five the best one we need music

1571
05:50:42,639 --> 05:51:14,209
I got you got you. I got you right here. Hold on four is underrated. It's pretty good

1572
05:51:17,349 --> 05:51:21,569
Hanging out an offline chat earlier. I put a poll up to see what people were thinking

1573
05:51:22,290 --> 05:51:27,220
I think only two people voted for four out of a couple hundred responses

1574
05:51:33,490 --> 05:51:41,119
Yeah, four is good, but five is just so much better

1575
05:51:41,919 --> 05:51:52,930
So what's the deal with the first one then because everybody said no, no, no, no do not play the first one. It is way different

1576
05:51:53,569 --> 05:51:56,040
You're gonna hate it

1577
05:51:56,040 --> 05:52:09,459
What's the um, what's the deal? It's just very dated very old. I mean, it's got to be

1578
05:52:11,840 --> 05:52:14,139
2002

1579
05:52:14,159 --> 05:52:16,159
2003 or something for devil may cry 1

1580
05:52:16,720 --> 05:52:21,490
Or was that still in playstation 1 was it ps2?

1581
05:52:28,060 --> 05:52:30,049
2001

1582
05:52:30,049 --> 05:52:44,479
Wow, it was originally resident evil 4

1583
05:52:48,080 --> 05:52:53,959
What hold on?

1584
05:52:54,040 --> 05:52:59,240
I mean you've got now i'm intrigued. I need to know what that is. It was gonna be a resident evil game

1585
05:53:00,040 --> 05:53:02,279
That's cool. All right, I kind of want to check it out

1586
05:53:07,700 --> 05:53:09,700
Same director is resident evil 2

1587
05:53:09,700 --> 05:53:15,459
Re4 had a lot of revisions

1588
05:53:24,040 --> 05:53:27,479
Have any advice on how to make colonoscopy prep more palatable?

1589
05:53:28,119 --> 05:53:32,439
You talk about drinking the the gross drink that makes you like shit for fucking three days

1590
05:53:34,200 --> 05:53:36,369
um

1591
05:53:36,369 --> 05:53:38,450
Yeah, you know what? I'll tell you that's the worst part

1592
05:53:41,459 --> 05:53:46,919
That's actually the worst part and that part sucks. Don't get me wrong

1593
05:53:48,799 --> 05:53:51,360
But for a colonoscopy colonoscopy is not

1594
05:53:52,659 --> 05:53:56,340
It's that is is simple the procedure is simple

1595
05:53:58,400 --> 05:54:00,400
It's just that

1596
05:54:00,400 --> 05:54:02,560
Drinking the drink in eating the thing

1597
05:54:03,360 --> 05:54:05,599
To clear you out. That's the actual worst part

1598
05:54:07,159 --> 05:54:08,500
so

1599
05:54:08,500 --> 05:54:10,500
You are doing the worst part right now

1600
05:54:10,819 --> 05:54:16,209
So when you're done with that and you get the few days you have to do it

1601
05:54:16,849 --> 05:54:18,610
On that last day

1602
05:54:18,610 --> 05:54:20,630
Just look in the mirror and go

1603
05:54:20,630 --> 05:54:22,470
Now it's time for the easy stuff

1604
05:54:22,470 --> 05:54:31,459
Because it actually is

1605
05:54:31,459 --> 05:54:37,880
Yeah, it sucks. But you know, you gotta take care of yourself. Do what you gotta do, right? Do what you gotta do

1606
05:54:42,240 --> 05:54:44,180
Thanks doc

1607
05:54:44,180 --> 05:54:56,680
Yeah, and then go get a large iced coffee

1608
05:54:58,439 --> 05:55:02,150
Uh, that's funny

1609
05:55:02,150 --> 05:55:05,270
I did say I was gonna puke blood today. Yeah, but that was just

1610
05:55:05,909 --> 05:55:08,500
That was just nonsense

1611
05:55:08,500 --> 05:55:13,669
All right. I'll see you guys later. See you friday. Thanks for watching. Take care call your mother

1612
05:55:14,389 --> 05:55:19,889
I mean especially if you didn't call your mother a few days ago

1613
05:55:20,689 --> 05:55:33,000
But now

1614
05:55:33,000 --> 05:55:35,000
Have a good one. Good night. Goodbye

1615
05:55:35,400 --> 05:55:37,400
See you soon
