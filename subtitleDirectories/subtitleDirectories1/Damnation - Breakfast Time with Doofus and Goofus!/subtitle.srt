1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,350
What is extreme content? What does that mean? It's not blood or gore. Usually the blood or gore is a checkbox.

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,579
Watch the first scene of this game. There's gonna be tits everywhere.

3
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,579
I asked you a question.

4
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,579
I don't know.

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,079
Yokiken?

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,079
That's this person's name, Yokiken.

7
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,079
That's something that like Chung Lee would scream when she shoots a fireball.

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,079
Yokiken! Yokiken!

9
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,380
Holy shit!

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,289
This is so loud! This is the loudest thing I've ever experienced.

11
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:01,289
Yokiken!

12
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,019
There's only one enemy down here.

13
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,349
Does it seriously have to be this loud?

14
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:18,689
I told you he was gonna die.

15
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:24,530
Is he gonna get run over by a motorcycle too? That's been the best.

16
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,530
What?

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,530
What an awful shot.

18
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,530
How are you not shooting him? How are you missing that? How did you miss those three shots?

19
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,340
Shoot him! Shoot him! He's already gone!

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,299
Ster?

21
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,299
Yes?

22
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:43,299
I didn't want to be the first one to say this, but I truly think...

23
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:47,299
I truly think this weird agency is poisoning the water supply.

24
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,299
Oh no!

25
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,659
Where is he? Breakfast is almost served.

26
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,659
Honey! I have your favorite Pop-Tarts!

27
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,659
Pop-Tarts!

28
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:02,659
This is the one window in the whole game!

29
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:03,659
No! You broke it!

30
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,290
Did you see me trying to jump through it?

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,289
You fucking broke it and you messed up the joke!

32
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:15,979
Honey, I've got your favorite breakfast snack here waiting for you.

33
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,979
It's Pop-Tart!

34
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:18,979
Pop-Tart!

35
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:19,979
Pop-Tart!

36
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,250
Honey! You know there's Pop-Tarts down here!

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,250
Huh? What? Pop-Tarts?

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,969
You fucking idiot. Get in there!

39
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:40,460
You know, I've got all these breakfast toaster strudel things here. They remind me of...

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,460
Toaster strudel? Toaster strudel?

41
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,629
I got it in. Oh no, I didn't. It's close.

42
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,810
Alright, it's in. I got it in. I got it in the house.

43
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,810
I got it in the house. Help me.

44
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,810
I don't know what to do. I'm stuck.

45
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,620
Well, get off of it.

46
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,819
Get off of it so we can do this joke.

47
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,819
I kinda can't, dude.

48
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Alright, I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna get off.

49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,060
You got this on the second floor?

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,870
Honey, I have your favorite breakfast food.

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,870
Pop-Tart?

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah, that was so cool.

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
This is lagging so bad.

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,560
This game just got so much better.

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,629
I was riding on the walls. This is so...

56
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,830
Oh my god.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
No, don't go. Don't go.

58
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,829
I'm dead.

59
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,550
I was dead.

60
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,550
I'm gonna burgably throw up right now.

61
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,620
Oh my god.

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,620
What is extreme content? What does that mean?

63
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:58,009
This was such a boring game. And then they added this to it.

64
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,569
Oh, you landed on the roof.

65
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,569
Watch out for this guy. I'm gonna die.

66
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,569
No, dude. What?

67
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,129
I'm dead. I'm dead.

68
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,069
Alright, here's your last chance, honey.

69
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,069
They're nice and piping hot. Pop-Tarts!

70
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,069
Please give me the Pop-Tarts.

71
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:32,480
Wait, mom. Mom, I need the Pop-Tarts.

72
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,449
I'm gonna use my superpowers to see where he is.

73
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,740
I'm not climbing up.

74
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,699
This is like on all those movies you watch with like the school bus is just hanging by a thread.

75
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,800
Do you see my tires spinning how much it's going?

76
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm stuck perfectly. Like, I have no traction.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
You cannot move at all?

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,670
No.

79
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,670
You cannot move this at all. This is like penis motorcycles.

80
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,740
Oh, yeah. Sure you can't.

81
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,740
No, no. Hitting the jet booster on the back kind of helps.

82
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,740
Alright, I'm done. I'm out of this fucking game.
