1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,820
Yo, Jerma, check out this sweet ass car right over here. Get in here. Don't knife it. Don't slice up my ride, nothing like that.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
We got an incredible orb in his, like, whack.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,820
Hey, Jerma!

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
What's up? Oh, a nice peel out.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,820
I like how we start in Star Junction every time, too. Hey, check out this cop. Cop!

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Hey, wait for me.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,820
Hey, I don't have a door.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,820
Shut up. He needs to see my car.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,820
I like this doorless DeLorean.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
Wait. Wait for me, guys.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Hey, guys. Wait up.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,820
Hey, guys. Jerma.

13
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,820
How did that not kill me? You hit me with the car. There's no way I didn't get hit by the hood of your car.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,399
I'm getting on this bike. You guys are gonna get biked.

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:06,200
That was great. That was like an action movie. You just pulled in perfectly into frame. Right when I... That was so great.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Let's go.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Alright, we're gonna... Alright, we're gonna do a race orb.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Alright. So, Star's gonna be the finish line. Alright?

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Okay.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,200
How did... I can't get... I can't get out of here.

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
You gotta get some speed. You gotta get some speed.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Oh, what the hell?

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,629
Hold on.

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,629
Hey, I just saw...

25
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,629
What? I'm like in the...

26
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,629
I thought you were like honking the horn.

27
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,629
I can hear that all the way down here.

28
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,629
I'm gonna go forward and see if I can make it over.

29
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,629
Come on.

30
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:45,969
I made it.

31
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:46,969
Oh, shit.

32
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:52,200
Your ride is still down here, no?

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
What are you doing?

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Trying to drive on top of your car.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
It looks like you're trying to hump my car.

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Maybe I am. It's a pretty nice, sexy car you got there.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
It's bouncing around all over the place.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Oh, fuck.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,530
That took them a long time to take me out.

40
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,599
Alright, guys. Let's bounce.

41
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
We just had a moment.

42
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,539
Hi.

43
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,539
Make a drug deal.

44
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,539
Is that another bike?

45
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,539
Yes, it is. That's another bike.

46
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,539
We're good.

47
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,719
Oh, another one right here, too.

48
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,050
More of the orange one.

49
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,669
Did you die?

50
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,669
Alright, should we all just die right here?

51
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,669
And then come right back and grab the bikes?

52
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:43,939
I don't have a...

53
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,430
Oh, damn.

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,430
This guy means business.

55
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,610
That guy just tossed me off the bike and shot me.

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,610
Bitch, you're shooting me. I didn't do anything.

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,610
Wow, you're getting fucked.

58
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,349
What the fuck?

59
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:02,349
Alright.

60
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,620
Alright, don't move, Orb.

61
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Orb, now they're shooting you.

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
Why?

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
I don't know.

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
No, they're not.

65
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
Yes, they are?

66
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,360
Fuck!

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Why did your gun just fly 30, 40 feet in the air?

68
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,530
Where are you?

69
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,530
Where the hell are you?

70
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,789
You're even lower than that?

71
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,159
Yeah, right below you.

72
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,419
Oh, damn it.

73
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,539
There you are.

74
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:44,039
Alright, it's time to end this.

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,680
What's it time for?

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,310
I don't have a parachute.

77
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh my god.

78
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,569
What are you doing, guys?

79
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,569
Guys? What happened?

80
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,569
You went right next to me.

81
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,060
Guys, what happened?

82
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
I don't...

83
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Wait.

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Where did you get the helicopter?

85
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,939
Where did you get that?

86
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,939
It was yours.

87
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,939
It landed safely.

88
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,250
It was intact?

89
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,250
Yeah. I shot you out of it and it just landed.

90
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,250
Oh my god.

91
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,620
Alright, I'm going up.

92
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,519
Where are you?

93
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,519
Where the fuck are you, Jerma?

94
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,519
I'm high. You're below me.

95
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,019
I don't know.

96
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

97
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,439
Dude!

98
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,620
Oh, I'm dead, huh?

99
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,439
I'll get you.

100
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,439
You are just raining fire on me.

101
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,899
Dude, I'll get him.

102
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,720
Have faith.

103
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
You're too far away for these shots to register.

104
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm going to get you eventually.

105
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,019
Don't worry.

106
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,019
This thing can't fire.

107
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,319
No!

108
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,319
I'm still alive.

109
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,649
Orb is there now, apparently.

110
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:32,649
You ain't getting me, sucker.

111
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,649
Oh my god!

112
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:37,019
Did you get him?

113
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,019
Yeah, I got him.

114
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:41,019
Did I hit you with that last rocket?

115
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:43,449
No.

116
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,420
It looked so close.

117
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,420
Just drive as fast as you possibly can.

118
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,740
Everyone has bikes because I have a bike.

119
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Everyone's a copycat.

120
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,050
You can never be a hipster in GTA.

121
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,060
As soon as I see something, I'm jumping.

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
What happened up there?

123
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,060
Tell me when you're jumping.

124
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,300
Do a countdown.

125
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
Do a bike jump.

126
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
Like a 360, 1080.

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,180
We're going to get some air from this.

128
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:25,980
Oh!

129
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,730
Hit escape and see where I am right now.

130
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:38,629
I don't know.

131
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:43,819
I don't know how that happened.

132
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,819
Wait, what the hell?

133
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,819
Look where he is on the map.

134
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,819
What the hell?

135
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,379
Me and him hit a jump right here.

136
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,379
I launched off the bike.

137
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,060
Let's ride to him.

138
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
What the hell?

139
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
Put that in slow motion, nerd.

140
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
I'll kill you.

141
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Wow.

142
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,939
That was one of the most intense things ever.

143
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,939
I started to laugh.

144
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,939
My head hurt because I was laughing too hard.

145
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,180
Then I realized what was happening.

146
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,060
I was just in shock.

147
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,519
Holy shit.

148
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,269
That was seriously unbelievable.

149
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:25,269
I thought you landed behind me.

150
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,269
I have no idea how that happened.

151
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:29,579
I think it's because I jumped off the bike

152
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,579
last second and we hit the telephone pole.

153
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,579
Yeah, I'm alive.

154
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,649
Not for long, apparently.

155
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:39,769
And I'm dead.

156
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,329
Fuck you, nerds.

157
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,329
I'm out.
