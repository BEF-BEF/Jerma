1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:18,170
I'm back. I'm here. I made it. The internet works. Stream is bopping. I can feel the energy.

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,320
It's time for the movies. I've been waiting for this like three days. The internet has been fixed.

3
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:36,229
I've been assured of that. We've done a lot of testing. Almost no drop frames in the last

4
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:42,859
probably 12 to 15 hours. That's pretty good. That's the green light. Now if we get a red light here,

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,840
then that's, I mean, that's not fair. But you kind of have to do what you do.

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:59,579
Are you talking to me? Yeah. But anyways, this room has been set up for the last three days to do this.

7
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,780
And I've been really excited to do this because this game looks really fun.

8
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:19,290
Looks like a good time. Get this out of the way. So everything gets zapped on like a monthly basis

9
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,219
here. And it's very frustrating. Can I just say? I mean, you guys know this. But I'm ready.

10
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:39,379
I'm not going to wait anymore. This is ready to go. Want me to prove it? Take a look at this shit.

11
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:48,840
All right. We're going to test. We're going to make sure it's synced up correctly. Yes,

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm wearing a wire. I'm sure you've been aware of that. And it's frame ready or what?

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:05,780
Okay. I'm in my workout gear. That's an Xbox live vision camera. They don't make these anymore. You

14
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,659
have to buy them from third party sellers. I bought two of them just in case the price goes up.

15
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,469
And of course, I've got my cocktail table over here.

16
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:25,370
Currently doing a Bay Breeze. If you don't know what that is. Look it up. It's tasty. Metal straw.

17
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:37,379
Yeah. It's better that way. It's colder. See? What is this? You'll find out. You'll find out

18
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:45,620
real soon. All right. So let's just do it. Let me get, let me get locked in. You can't even

19
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,900
hear the music is fucking awesome. There. Now you can hear it. We've got to sync this up. Make

20
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:58,650
sure. Can you see my mouth move when my mouth moves? One, two, three, four. Hey, we got a green

21
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:10,629
screen back here. Let's add some footage right now. Here we go. I'm in a car now. Take that one,

22
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:22,789
put it somewhere. I don't know. How about this one? He's riding a horse. Use it. Use any of this.

23
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:34,870
Who cares? That's two extra bonus clips that you didn't have before. All right. What do you say?

24
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:52,870
The sink is off. Ready? Here we go. Did you hear that? Hey, hey, it's off. What? How off is it?

25
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,490
All right. Can you hear my voice first or hear my voice later?

26
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:08,870
And this is very important. My audio is early. You hear it. You hear them. Okay. Hold on. Wait,

27
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:24,920
wait, wait. So if I'm early, shit. Hold on. If I'm early, how about up? Ready? Oh, hold up. Ready?

28
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:43,509
How was that? Better? Let's try. Good. To the music, to the beat. It's got to be to the beat.

29
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:56,060
It's important. Yeah. All right. Good. Let's go. Is it in focus? This is on the Xbox 360,

30
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,620
by the way. They don't make these anymore. They don't even make Xboxes anymore.

31
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:07,240
Are we in focus? Yes. Is the lighting okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure.

32
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:12,779
It's a little out of the green. Now it's still in the green. That's all right. It's okay.

33
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,990
Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the

34
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,149
outline without appearing too small or too big. If you find that anyone is too short or too tall

35
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:34,709
to fit in, tilt the camera up or down and try again. Welcome to the cut out studio. This is

36
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:43,189
why we separate your image from the background. Select start. Great. Please move out of the picture

37
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:52,459
while we scan the background. Please hold on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the

38
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:58,379
camera. Try playing around with the cut out style to see the best results. That's so bad.

39
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:07,459
Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background? What do you guys think? Four? I

40
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:15,160
think four looks good. Four has a little bit of haze on it though. One is bad. Two is worse. Three

41
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,980
is okay. Four is haze. I don't know if I like four. Which one? You tell me, right?

42
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:55,560
Shit! This is two. This is three. Who is three? I'll give you a lefty. No, it's okay.

43
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,420
We need to be trained at a very young age to use both of our hands and arms. Because seriously,

44
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,459
take a look at this. Ready? I'm going to show you. Ready? Watch this. Boom! You're gone. Right?

45
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:14,680
Have you come from over here? Have you come from that one? You're gonna laugh. I can't defend

46
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,899
off an attacker that way. Why can nobody use... We need to be taught at a young age to use both

47
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:29,819
of our hands. I can't... Throwing a ball like this is like... Throwing a ball like this, I can fucking...

48
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:41,259
I can go 100. All right. Two looks good. I'm already winded. This might be a quick one.

49
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,439
I've been waiting fucking three days to do this and I'm already like,

50
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:54,860
oh, I threw four punches. It's time to go home. All right. No, no, no. Two is fine.

51
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,430
One's actually not that bad either. I'll go two. Two is fine.

52
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:09,160
How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. I could do this one, but not yet.

53
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:20,120
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play

54
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:28,779
in the movie. No, no, no, no. I want a new picture. Step into one of the four outlines

55
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:36,139
for your picture. This will decide which role you play in the movie. That's scary. Oh, I know.

56
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:43,750
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play

57
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,299
in the movie. Why am I so scary looking? I just ripped out the fucking cord. I don't care.

58
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:57,240
Hold on. I have to connect my fucking wire. Player one, get your butt on the set.

59
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:11,460
This is me? Dodge the arms and strike the targets. Yeah, I tested this one. Pretend you're in a dojo

60
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,299
preparing for a big fight. Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score.

61
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:20,100
Anytime you look at somebody from the side, it's just like, oh.

62
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:33,850
Action. You fight like a master. That's smart. Right on target. You're getting the beating.

63
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:42,179
What a what? What's happening in the corner? What's that? That showed the dummy.

64
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:50,899
That's gonna hurt tomorrow. Take that, dummy. Always use the paw. Ouch. I bet you won't.

65
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:57,539
Always use the paw. That one was angry. Right here. Ouch. That's smart. They look like Nick

66
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:15,610
Arcade. Revenge. Crushing blow. Got it. You just beat the heck out of Bruce Lee there.

67
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:29,399
That wasn't bad. Player one, come to the set, please. I broke the fucking audio. And now

68
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,919
it's your time to shine. What do I do? Just follow my instructions and act like a star.

69
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Okay. Give me your most evil laugh. When? Now? Action.

70
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:58,580
Come on. That was fantastic. Oh, okay. Got it. You were a star. That's it. All right. Let's go.

71
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:13,340
Star. I look like a fucking character from The Office. I'm doing like a look in the camera.

72
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:22,740
Can you believe what Steve Carell just said? Player one, you need it on set.

73
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:32,700
What's next? Throw the log as far. All right. I can move my right hand. Throw the log.

74
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:40,539
Make like you're at the Highland Games in the Kavatoss event. Throw that pesky log as far as you

75
00:11:40,539 --> 00:12:13,740
can. Action. Was that 650? That wasn't bad. That's kind of far. Again. 200. Wait, I gotta be like in

76
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:28,250
it's kind of quick. Good throwing. That log sure won't bother us again.

77
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,529
I thought it was going to be like a situation where you just have to get the thing, the pixel

78
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:37,720
to touch quick. Player one, get yourself to the set. Don't worry. That's me. I know where

79
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm supposed to be right here. And now it's your time to shine. Just follow my instructions

80
00:12:46,659 --> 00:13:00,659
and act like you're a star. Show me fury. And action. Keep it up.

81
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:22,679
That was fantastic. You were a star. All right. I'm good. Imagine like looking into my window right

82
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:34,730
now. What am I practicing for? What is that person doing? Because there is no logical explanation

83
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:43,190
as to why somebody would be standing in their room doing this. I'm like hacking myself up for

84
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:52,360
what? Like a conference? Look at how red my face is. I didn't realize how hot it was going to be in

85
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,120
here. What am I? Okay. Pretend like you are a treasure hunter. Pull on the rope before the

86
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,179
time runs out to get the treasure. I'm like as red as the snow. I'm not, am I? Action. What?

87
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:24,169
I'm not very good at this, am I? Holy shit, I'm turning like green. I'm not this red.

88
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:35,190
Am I this red? What's happening? I'm like, I swear to God, this is like, this is like bizarre.

89
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:47,659
It's the camera. I'm turning into a Willy Wonka character. I have a sunburn.

90
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:58,340
Oh. What the fuck? No, no. I got to like, it's 110 degrees in Vegas right now. What the fuck

91
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:10,600
was I thinking? Get the ball in the hole three times. Hey, let me do this like, this is like,

92
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,490
oh, I got to shoot the basket. I'm not really, I'm not this red. Look and see, I'm not that red.

93
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:23,750
Where's the basket? Where's the ball? What? I don't know. Oh, that was close, but no cigar.

94
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:39,960
Oh, okay. Got it. Two. Only one more left. Shit. You can do better than that. Get in there.

95
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:52,899
Come on, sink the ball into the hole. We have a winner, ladies and gentlemen. By the way,

96
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,350
at the end of this, it cuts up a trailer. That's wonderful. With like three other random actors

97
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:11,980
that aren't in this house. That's a wrap. That's a wrap. Let's see. Are you ready? I'm ready.

98
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:27,059
Play every character. That's, that's kind of the idea. I have like four costumes here.

99
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:32,470
It's gonna be fucking impossible. I'm going to be like purple at the end of this.

100
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:56,840
Everyone's super. Every superhero's super. But some are more super than others.

101
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:17,900
Go on. And where there are heroes, there are villains, battles, adventure, breathtaking effects.

102
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:26,410
Not a silly costume in sight. Why am I in the Bowser plane? Ever wanted to wear your underpants

103
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:36,710
over your trousers? Rippling muscles. Astounding abilities. Fiercer than a ranting mom.

104
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:45,849
More courageous than a hungry mouse. Faster than waiting for a bus.

105
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,339
So when you're feeling low, remember everyone's super.

106
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:09,589
No, I don't want to replay that. Why do they have to be red? Oh, okay. No, I don't. Would

107
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:16,680
you like to save your movie? No. Why would I want to save this fucking movie? That was awful.

108
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:24,339
Save it. Who cares? Who cares?

109
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,230
That was a test. I was testing the program for that one to make sure it worked.

110
00:18:39,460 --> 00:19:00,420
I would just. J1. Who cares who? Nah, you guys ain't ever gonna see who cares what.

111
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:10,819
That's for me. That's a private showing only. That's only for me. I think I'm pretty sure I

112
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:18,809
was naked. Here's the thing, guys. I cannot be 100% certain that I am not 100% underwear

113
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:27,529
naked in that video. I don't know. I can't turn that on. I was testing it just to test the lighting

114
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:40,599
in the room. This was two or three days ago. That may as well be three years ago. This takes a long

115
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:51,430
time. Damn. He's testing the lighting in the room. What breed of dog is Otto? He's a dachshund,

116
00:19:51,430 --> 00:20:05,990
actually. Remind me never to save a movie ever again. What do the aliens in the teen sci-fi flick

117
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:14,180
the faculty need most for survival? I was gonna say sugar. Which ape leads the first

118
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:25,829
ape rebellion and conquest of the planet of the apes? I don't know. Caesar. In The Princess

119
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:41,529
Bride, what word does Miracle Max hate to hear? Yeah. From 1996, Romeo and Juliet took a year

120
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:51,130
off from Yale to film Terminator 3. Claire Danes, that's the one. 2008's The Dark Knight is a sequel

121
00:20:51,130 --> 00:21:01,079
to which film? Batman Again. I got it. I told you. I know what I'm doing. I know my movie trivia.

122
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:08,440
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen act together in this 2004 film. Freaky Friday. No, no, no, no, no.

123
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:18,089
Jennifer Lopez and Woody Allen provided voices for what animated insect film? Beam Movie.

124
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:44,789
Let's never do that again. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.

125
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:53,609
Awards? Yeah. And now the moment you've all been waiting for. Nobody's seen the movie yet. The

126
00:21:53,609 --> 00:22:06,859
nominees for best actor are. Nominee one. Nominee two. Random dropper's license image two.

127
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:22,579
Nominee three. Nominee four. But of course, there can only be one winner. And the You're in

128
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:37,130
the Movies Award for best actor goes to. Yes. Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious

129
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:43,690
award. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. I'm

130
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:48,890
glad everybody liked the trailer. The movie ain't out yet. You have to go see it still.

131
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:53,690
But I really appreciate the support nonetheless. Make sure to go see it next year when it comes out.

132
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,730
Have a great evening. Make sure to tweet at tip your waiters and waitresses. And I'm out.

133
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:25,400
Guns cold blooded. A spillage in a lab transformed a lizard into a monster,

134
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,839
causing panic and havoc. Let's check our equipment is working correctly.

135
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:40,420
Is the picture in focus? Is the lighting okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure.

136
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:48,660
There's 110 degrees in Vegas right now. This sun is just beaming in here. This fucking shitty

137
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:58,500
webcam from like 1998. This beaming sun. That's why I'm like turning red.

138
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:06,680
Can't hear me. I'm saying that it's be the sun is beaming in here.

139
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm gonna turn the music down. Thanks for the reminder. All right, light looks fine.

140
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,099
Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone can fit. I'm not going down that line

141
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,660
without appearing too small. People will do like a thing. Oh, look at the thing on the ground.

142
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,059
It's six feet tall. Therefore he's triangulated. He's fine too. I've seen that fucking joke a

143
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:44,309
thousand times. It's not going to be an original joke. Welcome to the cut out studio. This is where

144
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:51,319
we separate your image. Great. Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.

145
00:24:52,789 --> 00:25:00,759
Please hold on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the camera. That was scary because I

146
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:08,039
have a big shadow on my face. And I've got a real angular face. Like every single like you could

147
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,079
you could like get shade over here in my like angular fucking face. You know what I'm saying?

148
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:26,440
Two, uh, two is fine, right? Yeah. It's going to change a little bit as the light changes.

149
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:35,460
No, that's good. That's fine. How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. All right,

150
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,900
here's where I'm going to, I'm going to add an actor. I'm going to add an actor.

151
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:49,049
Step into one of the scientists and civilian. This will decide which role you play in the movie.

152
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:53,849
That person, I love how he's two. No, I'm going to start with two.

153
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:02,819
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play

154
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,700
in the movie. That's two. That's how I know that's two. No, no, no. I want a civilian.

155
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:16,569
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play

156
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:22,440
in the movie. All right, let's go. Scientists, civilian. So I got to remember that because I

157
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,359
got, I've got some, I got some wardrobe changes like a big girl on the fly. I'm happy with those.

158
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:36,980
Who's up first? So we've got me. We've got another actor. So that bathrobe guy is going to be a

159
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:43,259
player too. Why don't I even have this in my hand? Go into the obstacles and hit the jumps

160
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:51,019
in a car. Drive your scooter through town, dodge the obstacles, but hit the ramps to score.

161
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,579
Okay. I shouldn't have wore the red shirt. People would not even be commenting on my life.

162
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:20,380
I can't even see that far. Is that a jump? I should be reacting, shouldn't I? All right.

163
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:30,200
Like, whoops, whoops, whoops.

164
00:27:52,579 --> 00:28:04,069
Ghost rides it over the finish line. What a fucking probe. Player two to the set.

165
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:18,230
Pretend that you're surrounded by hornets. Swat those suckers before they sting you.

166
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:26,470
Action. Get these things away from me.

167
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,549
Sayonara, Stripey. Take them down.

168
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:51,400
These fuckers, they sting. One to swat. You sure can swat. All right. Play one.

169
00:28:52,119 --> 00:29:16,789
Who's turn? Oh, I'm competing against myself. How is that any better? Players one and two.

170
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:26,339
What? What do you mean two? Both of us? That means I have to be like, what? This is

171
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:32,440
called, this is both of us. Let's all do the conga. Hit the drums as fast as you can to make

172
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,460
the monkey dance faster. Shit. Okay. I thought we were going to be, see, okay, there we go.

173
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:58,789
It's two of, it's both of us. And action. Dance monkey boy. Get that monkey go.

174
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:10,599
What happens if there's four people on the screen? Player one, get your butt on the set.

175
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:22,170
Okay, I'm ready. It's me. It's time to put you in the spotlight. There's no scoring.

176
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:28,009
Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent. What is with that? There's like a spot

177
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:39,740
on, wipe it off. Action. Wipe that shit off. Come on. Show me what you got. This is not how

178
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:54,869
people walk. Right. Now try this. Do it again. As confused as you can. And action. More feeling.

179
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:05,609
Put more feeling into it. Let's do another. Give me a look of absolute terror. Go this way.

180
00:31:15,259 --> 00:31:23,380
Nailed it. I look like I'm fucking 15 years older in that middle picture.

181
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:31,380
Player two didn't even get to do anything. How am I still losing to the guy in the bathrobe

182
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:39,299
when he didn't even do anything? Fuck that guy. That guy sucks. What did you say to me?

183
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:50,410
Start the water from rising. Shut the valve as if your life depended on it. I have to do his face.

184
00:32:11,609 --> 00:32:23,420
You didn't even mess up your hair. I did though. I did.

185
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:37,049
Shut up. Fuck. It's me. It's me. I gotta do a better job to get the wasps.

186
00:32:42,869 --> 00:33:00,200
I gotta do better than me. It's gotta be slow. Slow and flick the fingers.

187
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,799
This is embarrassing. Hold on. I gotta make this less embarrassing.

188
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:31,480
You didn't get stung at all. Player two, I need you on set please. When I put on this other thing

189
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,430
on the ground here, you guys have no idea. This is going to get impossible. I need a personal

190
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:42,069
assistant. It's time for your starring moment. Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

191
00:33:45,269 --> 00:34:02,660
Act like you're a nervous wreck. Action. Nearly there. Now try this. What? Run on the spot as if

192
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:18,550
you're being chased. And action. Keep rolling baby. Fuck. One more. Shiver uncontrollably like

193
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:46,760
you're freezing. That was really good. Amazing. That was really good. It was. I don't want to,

194
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:56,070
you know, toot my second horn here, but it was pretty good. Just wait till I get my third and

195
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:02,250
fourth horn in here. Player one, come to the set please. Player one, it's me. Great job. No,

196
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,480
you good job. Good job. Good job. Now it's my turn. Pick the clothes that matter. What?

197
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,380
The costumes are all dirty. Pick the outfit that matches the hat and give them a good scrub.

198
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:27,940
Scrub the clothes? Why? I need like a lower body. Pick the what? Fuck. That's good. Now give it a

199
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:43,380
good wash. Come on. Are you sure that was right? Give it a wash anyway. You only got one. Oh,

200
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:51,739
no. Right. Right. Okay. Add the outfit to the hat. Okay. I fucked it up. Not that one. That one.

201
00:35:51,739 --> 00:36:00,780
Scrub it up and see what happens. Wait. This is, this is. Okay. So now I didn't even see the hat.

202
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,139
Come on. Are you sure that was right? I didn't see the hat. Give it a wash anyway. I didn't.

203
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:11,699
Sorry. Second me will get this. You're supposed to match the outfit to the hat. To the hat. Okay.

204
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:17,139
I can do it now. Ready? All right. It's just a regular hat. Now it's this hat. It's not the

205
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:31,590
clown hat. That's not the clown. That's not a regulation clown hat. Oh. Fuck that part.

206
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,510
How? How is that not good? How can you even determine that?

207
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,219
All right. I gotta nail this. Get the ball in the hole three times.

208
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:54,460
Oh, this is the, this is this thing again. Okay. It's all the fun.

209
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:48,969
Got it. Print. Ship it. Get yourself to the set. Holy shit. There's even more.

210
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:56,250
We need to do a few retakes. Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.

211
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:13,539
Retakes. How fucking you lean? Pretty far. And action. Get up. That was fantastic. You were a star.

212
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,500
That's fucking stupid. You take those green grass. Perfect. Let's go to the movies.

213
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:31,179
Here we go. Got it. Wait five minutes for it to load.

214
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,079
Is there any mature ones? It was a day like any other day.

215
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:19,739
Until a terrible accident. Created a horrifying atomic monster. Cold blooded. Watch in terror

216
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:31,750
as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc. Created by nature. Twisted by science.

217
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:44,309
No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it. Can anything stop this leviathan?

218
00:39:46,940 --> 00:40:01,429
Can mankind use science to fight nature with nature? Feel your blood run cold. Cold blooded.

219
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:11,030
Terrible. That was awful. That was really, really awful. Truly awful.

220
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:15,190
Best part is when he pushed me. They didn't even use the lean. What was the point of the lean?

221
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:36,920
That very beginning. Why do I feel like I'm watching green screen movie night footage?

222
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:49,019
That's like what this is. Except it's happening in real time. What do you mean don't save? Oh

223
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:54,059
right. Because of the... It takes like 10 minutes. All right. I'm gonna get these. I'll get these. I'll

224
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:12,550
get these. Come on. Play as all four characters? I will. I gotta ease into it though. There's like

225
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:24,170
25 movies to do. In what... Hold on. What movie spy has lost his identity? Faced a

226
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:34,090
supremacy in the 2007 issue Ultimatum? I haven't seen any of those. Boba Fett wears the armor of

227
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:46,789
what type of warrior? A space trooper. A storm trooper. Oh boy. What do the animated films

228
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:52,340
Corpse Bride and Curse of the Web Rabbit share? Tim Burton. Wait, did the bull stop? Stop motion.

229
00:41:52,900 --> 00:42:00,519
Oh never mind. In Sleepless in Seattle Sam and Annie meet at what famous landmark?

230
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:13,400
Starbucks. King Kong was also remade in 1976. What was the name of Jessica Lange's character?

231
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:24,980
Jessica. Bill Murray portrays a network television executive in what 1988 Christmas comedy based on

232
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:34,389
A Christmas Carol? I was just gonna say it. Scrooge. Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini both

233
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:47,670
appeared in which movie written by Quentin Tarantino? Saw IV? A teen thriller

234
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:57,670
disturbing mirror is the plot of what Alfred Hitchcock classic? Attack of the Birds. In which

235
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,829
southern state did Renee Zellweger spend her youth and earn her bachelor's degree? Mississippi.

236
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:13,179
I'm 0 for 10. In the line of the witch in the wardrobe... I didn't get a chance to even do that

237
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:33,619
one. Got it. Oh who wins the award? This is important. Who was better me or me? Welcome

238
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:41,159
to the You're in the Movies Awards. Who did a better job? Me or me? And now the

239
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:47,159
moments you've all been waiting for. Just went like a four me's in here. Nominees for best actor are

240
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:59,989
nominee one, nominee two, nominee three,

241
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:14,940
nominee four. I'm gonna say uh, I'm gonna say me, me one. Me one. And the You're in the Movies Award

242
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:27,610
not bathrobe actor goes to... Not bathrobe. Fuck. Please take to the podium to accept this

243
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:32,650
prestigious award. Perhaps you'd like to say a few words. What can I say? What can I say?

244
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:40,650
I was cloned off of this guy right here, up there. Yep. And they gave me two extra...

245
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:46,409
I'm not good. I'm not good in front of people. I'm not good in front of people.

246
00:44:54,019 --> 00:45:08,500
Thank you. It's been me all fucking time. It's been me. Like a crow's feet? How can I see that

247
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:24,360
on like a 144p camera? Fuck I do. I really do. Stop clapping at that. You maniacs. How do I get

248
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:44,619
this out of... How do I leave? Oh. Should we throw in a third actor? This one's called made of men.

249
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:55,400
Let's go. Me, me, me and me. Two friends break free to find they've been subjected to a cloning

250
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,699
experiment. What happens if it's just me? Okay, what happens if it's just me? Let's check our

251
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:08,170
equipment is working correctly. If it's just me, then who is the... What happened? Is the lighting

252
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:22,969
okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure. The lighting's fine. I bought this. This is a

253
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:29,690
Phillips Hue, sits on the table, coffee table, dumb fucking pretend ball light. I got this like

254
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:35,289
two years ago. Just about like a year ago maybe. I've not used it once. This is the only time I've

255
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:40,250
ever turned it on because I don't know what to do with it. So I'm going to add some light here.

256
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:55,579
The bar went down. What do I do with this though? I can make it a different color too. I wish I could

257
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:08,380
show you. Put it on the bright side. Is that going to help? Does it help me? What's this thing? What

258
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:15,929
does it mean for? Why did I buy that? It was like 70 bucks. Now let's position the camera. Make sure

259
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:20,010
everyone can fit themselves into the outline. I felt like, ooh, to be sitting on the coffee table

260
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,730
and I can make it like a nice warm hue. If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in.

261
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,210
I've never used that light once.

262
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,480
Hopefully they get my fucking... I need to get like a light pin.

263
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,800
I need like red pins.

264
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:57,800
With the cutout style to see the best results. Can you see yourself clearly in front of the

265
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:04,199
background movie? Four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four,

266
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:16,059
four, four, four. Four? But that's a little... Can you like see the outline though? I don't like

267
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:26,550
being able to see the outline. It's just like pretend. Four is bad luck. Better than two. What about

268
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:31,739
three? All right, I'm just gonna sit right here and I'm not gonna move from like here. Ready?

269
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:45,900
One looks all right. One looks okay. Three's too wiggly. And four has like a big halo around it.

270
00:48:50,360 --> 00:49:16,820
One's okay. My arms are fucked. I'll try four for one of these. I mean, I'm gonna be like blowing,

271
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,889

And it keeps cutting me off. Actually I'm kind of glad it is because I don't want to do that face.

407
01:16:29,510 --> 01:17:06,170
Here we go. Me. Me. And me. Today is a day you'll never forget. Why am I so bad? Somewhere.

408
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:11,689
Somewhere. At some point in time. In a secret location.

409
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:20,819
The boundaries of science are being stretched beyond breaking point.

410
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:37,829
Through the miracle of science you could find yourself becoming more. Much more.

411
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:51,000
What's wrong with me? Loads more. And then some. So when you're in a pickle there's only one person

412
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:04,890
you can count on. You and you and you. Did the software screw up and shape me?

413
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:24,659
Oh Jesus. I need to see that again. Let's replay. I just need to know. It did like the mapping

414
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:31,140
software. I don't know. Everybody just has the fadsuit on. I couldn't have made that any better.

415
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:47,109
We cannot afford to make another four player one that took a half an hour. I know right?

416
01:18:47,109 --> 01:19:22,119
Me. Me. And me. Today is a day you'll never forget. Somewhere. At some point in time.

417
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:34,060
In a secret location. The boundaries of science are being stretched beyond breaking point.

418
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:47,979
Through the miracle of science you could find yourself becoming more. That's pressing the button.

419
01:19:50,220 --> 01:20:04,329
Much more. Loads more. And then some. So when you're in a pickle there's only one person you

420
01:20:04,329 --> 01:20:19,289
can count on. You and you and you. My god. No I don't want to replay that. I guess I'll save it.

421
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:45,930

432
01:22:49,640 --> 01:23:04,329
Grease is like in the 40s. Grease is seriously like 19 fucking like 52. Who wins the award?

439
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:41,529
Uh thank you for the award. I appreciate it. There were some other great candidates up here

440
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:46,810
but I'm really happy to see that. Ah yes I'm waving to you in the top right. I'm really happy

441
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:53,850
to see that that I'm the candidate that you choose to represent you in this latest election.

442
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:36,260
I'm not doing for everything. I can't do for it. Scared witness. What's private money? Murder at

443
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:45,239
the mansion. A practical joker is mysteriously murdered in the slapstick whodunit. Let's check

444
01:25:45,239 --> 01:25:51,000
our equipment is working correctly. Is the picture in focus? Yes it is. Is the lighting

445
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:59,560
okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure. Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone

446
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:05,000
can fit themselves into the outline without appearing too small or too big. If you find that

447
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:13,670
anyone is too short or too tall to fit in tilt the camera up or down and try again. Welcome to

448
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:20,630
the cut out studio. This is where we separate your image from the background. Select start cut out

449
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:30,970
studio to continue. Great please move out of the picture while we scan the background. Please hold

450
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:40,060
on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the camera. Try playing around with the cut out style

451
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:45,020
to see the best results. Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?

452
01:26:53,699 --> 01:27:06,439
How many actors are there? Choose the correct number. Not four. Two. Not four. I can't do four

453
01:27:06,439 --> 01:27:23,619
of them. It took like 40 minutes. Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will

454
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:31,399
decide which role you play in the movie. Murder suspect. Murder suspect. But I think I want

455
01:27:31,399 --> 01:27:40,739
prankster though. Don't you guys think prankster? Hold on. Step into one of the four outlines for

456
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:48,100
your picture. This will decide which role you play in the movie. What a shitty superhero mask.

457
01:27:48,340 --> 01:28:01,699
Player one you need it on set. I want I'm gonna do the hat and the white scarf. I've done this like

458
01:28:01,699 --> 01:28:11,420
already. Let's do this one again. It's all the fun of the fair. Throw the ball in the hole three times

459
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:32,579
to win a prize. Action! Come on. Think the ball into the hole. Hey let's do this one again. Hey

461
01:28:47,909 --> 01:29:03,590
Only one more left. Oh that was close but no cigar. You can do better than that.

462
01:29:06,619 --> 01:29:14,359
You didn't get enough. I did get enough. I got three. That's enough. That's enough. All right uh

463
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:22,500
I should have got a wig. I should have got a wig. I think Kim has some wigs. Player two

464
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:31,510
to the set. Although that I will sweat through that and I will ruin her wig. It'll be horrible.

465
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:40,869
It's time to act like a clown with a bungee run. Well that's easy. Run as far as you can before the

466
01:29:40,869 --> 01:30:00,970
power of the bungee drags you back. And action! Get those arms moving to gain speed. That was

467
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:11,369
some bungee. You did it. She has like all kinds of wigs and stuff. Player one on the set please.

It's digging time. See who can do it the quickest. Shake the jackhammer handles as hard as you can to

474
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:57,220
drill. Action! Keep it up. Don't stop now. Come on. It's hard to hold this here the whole time. You

475
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:04,439
didn't dig far enough. Look at all those zits. No there's not. That's like a mole or something.

476
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:16,949
That looks ridiculous. Player one get your butt on the set. No that's like lighting. And now

481
01:33:12,579 --> 01:33:21,100

This game. This is gonna be fucked. Yeah. No it isn't. Players one and two on set now please.

They're all fucked. Let's all do the conga. Hit the drums as fast as you can to make your monkey

484
01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:57,079

485
01:33:57,079 --> 01:34:06,890
the only games that actually uses it. I'll give you your hand too. I'll help you. Don't worry.

01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:52,659

497
01:36:48,810 --> 01:37:01,909
You were born to be a dancer. You won't take no for an answer. That's how I dance. Player two

498
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:16,810
on set. Oh that's me I'm playing too. Pretend you're in a dojo preparing for a big fight.

499
01:37:17,369 --> 01:37:22,489
Avoid the arms of the training dummy and hit the targets to score. I could actually put it on for

500
01:37:22,489 --> 01:37:40,470
this. Action. Revenge. Dump. Dump. Dummy. What a crushing blow. Ouch that's smarts. Bullseye.

501
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:56,619
Take that dummy head. That showed the dummy. You fight good. That's gonna hurt. I clearly did not

502
01:37:56,619 --> 01:38:16,279
get it by any of those. Right on target. Ash. I hit by a dummy. That was awful. I couldn't decide who

503
01:38:16,279 --> 01:38:24,020
was more wooden. You were the dummy. Shut up. I gotta do like a big Dracula cape next time. That's

504
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:36,140
a wrap. Here we go. Let's go to the movies. Here we go. That was way too much. All right I'm gonna

506
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:24,729
when murder's on the menu. Murder at the mansion. Everyone has a motive.

507
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:43,539
It's coming. Everyone has a secret. Everyone is a suspect. Am I gonna kill this guy?

508
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:51,300
Who has the last laugh when a joke goes too far?

509
01:39:51,300 --> 01:40:04,710
But who is to blame? Who is guilty of murder at the mansion?

510
01:40:07,029 --> 01:40:13,350
So bad. Dude the freeze frame. Because I don't know. I must have done it wrong.

511
01:40:16,869 --> 01:40:35,529
Let's see it one more time. That was when I like smashed my head on the table. That's so fucking

512
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:48,140
stupid. At least it didn't make me fucking 12 sizes bigger than I am. I think I'm just

513
01:40:48,140 --> 01:41:02,279
doing fat suit next time. All right cheese. Dial M for a menu. Today's meal is murder.

01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:39,750
Everyone has a secret. Everyone is a suspect. What was the dancing? Who has the last laugh

516
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:57,449
when a joke goes too far? But who is to blame? Who is guilty of murder at the mansion? It's the

517
01:41:57,449 --> 01:42:04,329
guy in the red shirt. He's attacked and he's hurt everybody. It was me. I did it all. What do you

Holy fuck. I'm so glad this camera sucked.

542
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:35,140
Thank you. Okay. Ah whatever. What are they doing over there? That was it happened so fast

543
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:39,619
that you may not have been able to see it. I can see it on no I don't even know where it is.

544
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:50,550
It was disgusting. With even like a 360p camera that is like that is career ruining.

545
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:57,109
That is career ruining. Thank god it's a shitty fucking cell phone camera.

546
01:47:58,789 --> 01:48:18,170
All right what we got? Let's check our equipment is working correctly. Is the picture in focus?

547
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:29,850
We have to do the romance one. Is the lighting okay in here? Check the light meter to be sure.

548
01:48:31,689 --> 01:48:37,850
Now let's position the camera. Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline without

549
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:44,090
appearing too small or too big. If you find that anyone is too short or too tall to fit in,

550
01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:52,489
tilt the camera up or down. Welcome to the cut out studio. Great please move out of the picture

551
01:48:52,489 --> 01:49:02,229
while we scan the background. Please hold on. Cut out complete. Now get back in front of the

552
01:49:02,229 --> 01:49:09,109
camera. Try playing around with the cut out style to see the best results. Can you see yourself

553
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:23,109
clearly in front of the background movie? How many actors are there? Choose the correct number.

554
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:31,640
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture. This will decide which role you play

555
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:44,060
in the movie. If the picture is okay, press A to continue. Otherwise, retake.

556
01:49:58,659 --> 01:50:17,460
That's this. I said to drink this one slow right? Play one get yourself to the set.

557
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:21,939
I'm surprised I've been able to do it for this long and not fucking pass out.

558
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:30,520
Oh. Beat the drums to make the boat go faster. It's a tropical storm.

559
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:35,720
Run away. Beat the drums as fast as you can to make your boat move faster.

560
01:50:36,920 --> 01:51:05,529
Action. Keep going. Left, right, left, right. You pushed it to the limit. Great score.

561
01:51:06,489 --> 01:51:13,899
7,500 points being no points. All right here we go. What's next two or four or three or one?

562
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:26,789
Players two and three. On set now please. Two and three? No this is the mud one.

563
01:51:26,789 --> 01:51:33,319
This doesn't matter. Mud fight. Splash your opponent with mud till you can't see them anymore.

564
01:51:39,899 --> 01:51:58,220
Action. Keep splashing. You did it. He's as happy as a pig.

565
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:16,470
Who's Jerma's sexy friend? Player four to the set. Oh it's the fat guy. Everybody laugh out loud at

566
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:25,720
the fat guy. Oh sorry hold on let me get my fat fucking suit on. It's time to act like a clown

567
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:31,399
with a bungee run. Now run as far as you can before the power of the bungee drags you back.

568
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:53,590
Action. Get those arms moving to gain speed. That was some bungee. You did it. Naked. Naked. Naked.

569
01:52:56,760 --> 01:53:09,289
Player one I need you on set please. And now it's your time to shine. There's no scoring.

570
01:53:09,289 --> 01:53:21,460
Just follow my instructions and act like a star. Look as embarrassed as you can. Action.

571
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:37,619
Don't stop now. Stay on set. Cry your eyes out. I can do this. I'm really gonna cry. And action.

572
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:50,250
That's it. You were amazing. What a pro. The one on the right is a flash at me right in the face.

573
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:58,489
Get your butt on the set. Can you stand together there? Turn your flash off in a movie theater.

574
01:53:58,489 --> 01:54:02,409
Yes I'll take a few photos. It's time to put you in the spotlight. Who is this player? Just follow

575
01:54:02,409 --> 01:54:08,409
my instructions and show me your acting talent. Who is this? Who is this? What character is this?

576
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:21,260
Imagine you're celebrating a big win. Action. Yeah. Keep it up. Right here comes another.

577
01:54:24,039 --> 01:54:41,930
Shake your head and wag your finger. Action. Keep it going. That was fantastic. You were a star.

578
01:54:55,140 --> 01:55:00,739
Players three and four on set now please. I'm just gonna put the bat suit on. I don't care.

579
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:13,130
See who can get the hula hoop moving fastest. The faster it goes the more you score.

580
01:55:18,649 --> 01:55:20,090
And action.

581
01:55:24,489 --> 01:55:28,170
Come on work with me here. Move those hips people.

582
01:55:28,489 --> 01:55:35,529
Move those hips people.

583
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:56,119
Player one to the set. Dance to the music. All right come on. I'm gonna do like a

584
01:55:56,119 --> 01:56:03,079
burn baby burn. It's time to stretch your funky stuff. Dance to the music and match the position

585
01:56:03,079 --> 01:56:07,640
of the hands to pose. Like that one? The Fortnite one? What's it it goes like this? Action. It goes

586
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:33,640
like this. What's the Fortnite one? I don't know how to do it. Can you feel it? Let the music take over.

587
01:56:37,899 --> 01:56:47,319
Work that booty. Work that booty. Funky. That was some performance. Great with a capital

588
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,439
ending. You can't dance on camera unless you know what you're doing.

589
01:56:51,159 --> 01:56:54,939
Because that ends up in a fucking folder. Play it too. Get yourself to the set.

590
01:57:04,890 --> 01:57:11,050
The costumes are all dirty. Pick the outfit that matches the hat and give them a good scrub.

591
01:57:13,609 --> 01:57:38,140
This one sucks. Action. That's good. Now give it a good wash. This. Great. That one. Don't forget to

592
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:46,329
wash it. You're forever making bubbles. Try the costume on.

593
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:57,140
All right pirate hat. I wonder if it's gonna be that one. That's good. Now give it a good wash.

594
01:58:06,199 --> 01:58:21,109
Great. Don't forget to wash it. Try it on for size. Funky. Finally. That's good. Now give it a good

595
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:35,079
wash. You did real good. The costume crisis is over. Two has real boring stuff so far. How's

596
01:58:35,079 --> 01:58:43,850
this romance? Player three you need it on set. What is romantic about this? Like doing the washing

597
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:49,289
clothes. It's time for your starring moment. Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

598
01:58:51,689 --> 01:58:57,930
I want to see your angriest face. Step closer and crouch down if you need to.

599
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:15,079
Action. That's it. Keep it going. You brought the house down. Beautiful. I can't believe I have to

600
01:59:15,079 --> 01:59:26,300
sell the farm. I don't want to sell the farm. We have to do something. I don't want to sell it.

601
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:32,140
It's time for your starring moment. There's no scoring. Follow my instruction and act your

602
01:59:32,140 --> 01:59:42,869
heart out. Three, four, two, one. Which one? Point at the camera and laugh. And action.

603
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:56,420
More feeling. Put more feeling into it. Stay on set. Dance a jig. What the fuck am I doing?

604
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:14,340
Action. Come on. Come on. Great. Stay there. Imagine you're celebrating a big win. Action.

605
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:33,079
Keep it up. Keep it up. You were amazing. What a pro. I hope these don't automatically get

606
02:00:33,079 --> 02:00:45,560
posted online. It was one. Fuck. Player two. On the set, please. This is what I can't do.

607
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:50,359
Oh, no. I lost my wire. It's supposed to be in my underwear. It's supposed to go like up.

608
02:00:51,239 --> 02:00:54,920
Not my underwear, but it's supposed to go through me. Now, you must have seen this before.

609
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:05,689
Watch the cups carefully. Then point at the cup that you think contains the P. Action.

610
02:01:05,689 --> 02:01:19,369
Round and round they go. Okay. Which cup? That one. You found it. There's no pulling the

611
02:01:19,369 --> 02:01:38,970
wool over your eyes. Round and round they go. Okay. Which cup? You found it. There's no pulling the

612
02:01:38,970 --> 02:02:00,460
wool over your eyes. Round and round they go. Okay. Which cup? You got all three. There are

613
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:11,350
no flies on you. Oh, it's a green Cheeto. Player three. Get your butt on the set. What a romance.

614
02:02:12,069 --> 02:02:20,420
Oh, shut the valve. I can't wait to see how romantic this is. Start the water from rising.

615
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:32,729
Shut the valve as if your life depended on it. It's backwards. Action. Turn the wheel.

616
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:51,590
Faster. Faster. Hey, hi there. You stopped the water. It didn't even mess up your hair.

617
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:05,750
Players one and four. On set now, please. One and four. Well, it's gonna have to be me like this.

618
02:03:06,710 --> 02:03:17,159
Oh, bro. Pretend like your treasure hunters. Pull on the rope to lift the treasure from the deep.

619
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:36,489
Whoever does it fastest wins. And action. Booty. It sure was an annoying look.

620
02:03:37,369 --> 02:03:51,590
I'm starting to pull up this hot, sweaty fucking lard thing. Player two, I need you on set, please.

621
02:03:52,550 --> 02:04:04,090
It's time to put you in the spotlight. There's no scoring. Just follow my instructions and show

622
02:04:04,090 --> 02:04:20,300
me your acting talent. Act grumpy and let out a big, long sigh. Action. Keep it up. Let's do

623
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:38,739
another. Pretend to push something out of the way. And action. That's it. Hear that applause?

624
02:04:39,619 --> 02:04:48,739
What a moment. Player one on the set, please. I'm not a psycho. I just pretend to be one on TV.

625
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:59,819
It's time to put you in the spotlight. Just follow my instructions and show me your acting

626
02:04:59,819 --> 02:05:13,270
talent. Give the frog a loving stare. The frog? Action. Come on. Show me what you got.

627
02:05:13,909 --> 02:05:22,170
What the hell? Good. And another. Point straight ahead of you as if you've just seen something

628
02:05:22,170 --> 02:05:34,229
shocking. Action. The heck happened over there? Holy shit. They loved ya, baby.

629
02:05:34,949 --> 02:05:45,779
I'm giant right now. Stop looking at the camera.

630
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:55,899
The camera. The number one rule of all of acting. Player three, come to the set, please.

631
02:06:03,449 --> 02:06:10,250
Now clear your mind. Focus your energies. Chop the blocks until they break. Where's the hat?

632
02:06:10,250 --> 02:06:14,970
Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat? Where's the hat?

633
02:06:14,970 --> 02:06:38,010
Action. Cracked it. Actor smash. Cracked. You've broken. Corn holy. Bye bye rock. You smashed it.

634
02:06:38,890 --> 02:06:45,210
Another rock bites the dust. Smash that stone. Actor smash.

635
02:06:47,130 --> 02:06:54,500
You broke the rock. Boom. You cracked it. Bye bye rock.

636
02:06:55,380 --> 02:07:02,340
Broke it. That was awesome. Ever thought of making statues for a living?

637
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:15,449
Players one and two. On set now, please. It's just me. I don't care. Am I drinking?

638
02:07:19,220 --> 02:07:22,659
It's marathon time. Run the distance as fast as you can.

639
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:30,710
I'm not drinking fucking vomit. Action.

640
02:07:33,640 --> 02:07:42,069
Slow down or you'll burn out. I know you got what it takes.

641
02:07:42,949 --> 02:07:49,270
I need to go to the sprint. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself.

642
02:07:51,670 --> 02:08:01,449
We have a blowout, ladies and gentlemen. That was some race. You thought of going pro?

643
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:08,569
This does look like you. It really does. You're right. It looks like somebody pooped in there.

644
02:08:08,569 --> 02:08:11,689
Player four. On the set, please. That's disgusting.

645
02:08:12,329 --> 02:08:17,880
I'm going to get ice and get home. Play who? Four?

646
02:08:20,329 --> 02:08:27,289
Dance to the music and match each pose. When the music stops, get into the outline and remember,

647
02:08:27,289 --> 02:08:40,409
hold still while you're posing. And action. Move a muscle.

648
02:08:43,180 --> 02:09:03,659
Let's dance. Freeze. Let's dance. Hold that pose. Let's dance.

649
02:09:04,619 --> 02:09:13,060
Stop dancing. You were born to be a dancer. You won't take no for an answer.

650
02:09:13,859 --> 02:09:20,710
This stream is fucking vomit right now. Don't look at my stomach. Player three. To the set.

651
02:09:26,699 --> 02:09:36,710
And now it's your time to shine. Just follow my instructions and act like a star. Pose like a

652
02:09:36,710 --> 02:09:56,340
hero. Action. Nearly there. You brought the house down. Beautiful. Player one. I need you on set,

653
02:09:56,340 --> 02:10:09,210
please. Real heroic. Fucking costume changes. And now it's your time to shine. There's no scoring.

654
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:18,939
Just follow my instructions and act like a star. Blow me a big kiss. Oh, I don't want to because

655
02:10:18,939 --> 02:10:30,470
people are going to keep this from me. Action. Keep rolling, baby. And another. Look up to the sky

656
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:52,149
as if you've just seen a flying pig. Action. Don't stop now. They loved you, baby. That's a wrap,

657
02:10:52,149 --> 02:10:59,289
folks. Here we go. After this one, I'm going to get ice. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

658
02:10:59,369 --> 02:11:11,270
which man investigated a photo of fairies in film fairies. True story vomit. What is Biff?

659
02:11:27,979 --> 02:11:47,510
Looking for love is a tricky business. Having a best friend can make it harder. A little romance.

660
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:54,869
Excitement and security is what we're all looking for.

661
02:11:55,670 --> 02:12:06,789
It's fucking huge. It doesn't work out. We try again.

662
02:12:10,539 --> 02:12:30,630
And again. But sometimes the right one for you is closer than you think.

663
02:12:35,029 --> 02:12:39,670
Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.

664
02:12:39,670 --> 02:12:51,500
When he opens the door and he's naked, he's just naked. I need to see it again.

665
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:16,789
I'm going to be quiet for this one. I'm going to try. The whole dancing thing still makes no

666
02:13:16,789 --> 02:13:22,229
sense to me. That's like a full two minutes of acting. All right.

667
02:13:23,189 --> 02:13:23,689
Okay.

668
02:13:30,359 --> 02:13:49,880
Looking for love is a tricky business. Having a best friend can make it harder. A little romance.

669
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:57,239
Excitement and security is what we're all looking for.

670
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:30,539
And if it doesn't work out, try again and again. But sometimes the right one for you

671
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:41,960
is closer than you think. Watch close to your heart because love is never far away.

672
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:57,850
Oh my god. I kind of have to. That was fucking ridiculous.

673
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:07,289
He's still at large. Why the hell keep getting arrested? The bar is closing on him.

674
02:15:08,409 --> 02:15:14,550
Oh my goodness. I got to go get ice, man. I got to fucking take a break after this one.

675
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:28,020
That was fucking so stupid. What website was that? And the fact that there's a scene

676
02:15:28,659 --> 02:15:35,260
with just two fat Fatsuit people at a club or something. What?

677
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:39,670
It doesn't make any sense. Did I fuck something up? I think I screwed something up.

678
02:15:41,670 --> 02:15:51,189
It was the same person. I'm just going to call it love story. God damn, that was fucking fun.

679
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:59,430
At the very end, with pushing the cake, there's no context to any of this shit.

680
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:09,979
All right. I'll be right back while this saves. I'm going to grab some ice.

681
02:16:10,539 --> 02:16:12,869
I'm going to grab some water and I'll be right back.

682
02:18:28,629 --> 02:18:34,389
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.

683
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:45,639
And now the moment you've all been waiting for. The nominees for best actor are.

684
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,040
See, I had to blow my nose after that.

685
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:49,159
Nominee one.

686
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:54,100
Oh shit. Who's best actor?

687
02:18:57,209 --> 02:18:58,409
Nominee three.

688
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:03,370
Nominee four.

689
02:19:05,959 --> 02:19:09,639
But of course, there can only be one winner.

690
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,719
And the You're in the Movies Award for best actor goes to.

691
02:19:23,829 --> 02:19:27,110
Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award.

692
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:29,510
Perhaps you'd like to say a few words.

693
02:19:30,569 --> 02:19:33,770
Really fucking excited and happy about the last production.

694
02:19:34,569 --> 02:19:37,690
So much that I decided, yeah, I decided to do my favorite drink.

695
02:19:38,979 --> 02:19:40,739
Cranberry juice, vodka, and vomit.

696
02:19:44,149 --> 02:19:55,430
The Bay Breeze. Look it up. Fuck the Academy.

697
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:07,829
Drunk yet? No.

698
02:20:28,579 --> 02:20:29,459
Scared witness.

699
02:20:29,459 --> 02:21:14,790
Oh, we drop frames.

700
02:21:15,909 --> 02:21:21,639
All right, let's get back to it.

701
02:21:22,979 --> 02:21:23,700
That's really awesome.

702
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:31,190
All right, I'm going to turn it down so we can get back to normal.

703
02:21:33,239 --> 02:21:35,239
Okay, scared witness.

704
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:36,920
Private one.

705
02:21:40,489 --> 02:21:41,610
Let's check our equipment.

706
02:21:41,610 --> 02:21:42,969
I'm going to move the shit back to where it was.

707
02:21:44,969 --> 02:21:49,530
Oh my God, why is the fucking grease grate fell on him?

708
02:21:50,250 --> 02:22:13,909
Okay, is it in focus?

709
02:22:13,909 --> 02:22:14,409
I don't know.

710
02:22:17,209 --> 02:22:17,850
Lighting is okay.

711
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:25,959
All right, I'm going for it.

712
02:22:25,959 --> 02:22:26,920
I'm going for four again.

713
02:22:40,069 --> 02:22:41,909
Now get back in front of the camera.

714
02:22:42,629 --> 02:22:46,870
Try playing around with the cutout style to see the best results.

715
02:22:47,430 --> 02:22:50,229
Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?

716
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:51,670
This one looks a little worse.

717
02:22:55,940 --> 02:22:56,659
Recalibrate it.

718
02:22:59,290 --> 02:23:00,170
That's all right. That's enough.

719
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:01,690
Two always seems to work.

720
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:03,290
How many actors are there?

721
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:05,129
There are four actors. I'm doing it again.

722
02:23:08,649 --> 02:23:10,489
What other thing can I fucking put in here?

723
02:23:10,489 --> 02:23:12,329
Which role you play in the movie?

724
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:39,469
Did I get it?

725
02:23:39,469 --> 02:23:42,889
If the picture is okay, press A to continue.

726
02:23:42,889 --> 02:23:44,409
Otherwise, retake.

727
02:23:47,129 --> 02:23:49,610
It's like that you're on a Disney ride and no.

728
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:55,639
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.

729
02:23:55,639 --> 02:23:56,360
I have to be my team.

730
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:58,200
This will decide which role you play in the movie.

731
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,239
Just do it. Do it.

732
02:24:04,569 --> 02:24:07,850
If the picture is okay, press A to continue.

733
02:24:08,649 --> 02:24:13,020
Wasted enough damn time.

734
02:24:13,739 --> 02:24:16,709
Player one, come to the set please.

735
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:18,950
Okay, I need to get ready to get into this stuff.

736
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:20,549
So I get this the bat suit.

737
02:24:20,549 --> 02:24:21,829
I need to like have a costume.

738
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:24,520
All right.

739
02:24:25,059 --> 02:24:26,180
Oh, this is all fucked up.

740
02:24:27,479 --> 02:24:28,120
It's not manned.

741
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:30,920
Drive your scooter through town.

742
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:33,959
Dodge the obstacles but hit the ramps to score.

743
02:24:35,319 --> 02:24:39,979
Okay, I got my cap suit. Ready?

744
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:47,979
You got a license for that thing.

745
02:24:49,379 --> 02:24:49,879
This.

746
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:52,979
I can paint work.

747
02:24:54,090 --> 02:25:06,389
You said we have a plane.

748
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:08,469
It's stunt man.

749
02:25:08,469 --> 02:25:12,709
They're going to use a clip of this for five seconds.

750
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:23,180
Have you got a license for that thing?

751
02:25:24,219 --> 02:25:24,719
Just go.

752
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,700
They're going to use a second of this.

753
02:25:29,879 --> 02:25:31,559
They're going to use a second of this footage.

754
02:25:31,559 --> 02:25:32,600
Why? I don't even want to do it.

755
02:25:33,239 --> 02:25:38,920
I'm standing up on it.

756
02:25:41,290 --> 02:25:42,090
Can I do one knee?

757
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:51,819
Hurry up. I'm trying.

758
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:55,420
I'm trying to get out there as fast as I can.

759
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:01,049
Player two to the set.

760
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:03,770
All right. I finally have this on the right way.

761
02:26:04,649 --> 02:26:07,459
The bat suit's been on backwards the whole time.

762
02:26:07,459 --> 02:26:12,389
Okay, wise guy.

763
02:26:12,389 --> 02:26:13,270
You think you're tough?

764
02:26:13,909 --> 02:26:17,590
Walk the mean streets of the city and whack those gangsters.

765
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:19,670
But mind you don't hit the broads.

766
02:26:19,670 --> 02:26:20,469
Whack the gangsters.

767
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,040
And action.

768
02:26:24,040 --> 02:26:32,040
What did she ever do to you, bully?

769
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:35,829
Don't hit that dames.

770
02:26:37,379 --> 02:26:38,420
You whacked him.

771
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:40,100
But mind you don't hit the dames.

772
02:26:41,219 --> 02:26:43,379
Oops. I don't knock the green screen over.

773
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:52,280
Go. That's bad for business.

774
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:56,059
You took him down.

775
02:26:56,700 --> 02:27:00,579
You busted my boards here.

776
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:06,229
You took him down.

777
02:27:06,870 --> 02:27:12,840
You whacked him.

778
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:14,520
But mind you don't hit the dames.

779
02:27:16,200 --> 02:27:18,360
You sure know how to treat a lady.

780
02:27:19,319 --> 02:27:19,819
I did it.

781
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:23,399
I gotta recalibrate because I punched the box man.

782
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:30,149
Players three and four.

783
02:27:30,149 --> 02:27:31,430
On set now, please.

784
02:27:33,059 --> 02:27:33,559
Wait.

785
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:43,290
Oh god damn it.

786
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:44,010
Don't knock it over.

787
02:27:55,579 --> 02:27:56,139
Better?

788
02:27:56,139 --> 02:27:56,639
Better.

789
02:27:57,020 --> 02:27:58,139
A little, a little bit better.

790
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:02,079
Yeah, that's fine.

791
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:02,879
All right, continue.

792
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:05,530
This is the mug one again.

793
02:28:05,530 --> 02:28:06,649
Three and four.

794
02:28:06,649 --> 02:28:07,690
Just put the f**king hat on.

795
02:28:08,889 --> 02:28:11,930
Splash your opponent with mud till you can't see them anymore.

796
02:28:12,729 --> 02:28:18,909
Action.

797
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:39,239
You did it.

798
02:28:39,239 --> 02:28:40,680
He's as happy as a pig in...

799
02:28:52,170 --> 02:28:53,850
Player one, you need it on set.

800
02:29:00,299 --> 02:29:02,700
And now it's your time to shine.

801
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:06,219
And act like a star.

802
02:29:08,670 --> 02:29:10,670
Try to raise one of your eyes.

803
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:11,309
I can't.

804
02:29:11,309 --> 02:29:12,110
I'm just gonna scream.

805
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:13,469
Step closer to the camera.

806
02:29:21,930 --> 02:29:30,440
Feeling, feeling into it.

807
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:31,719
Stare at the wasp.

808
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:35,000
Step closer and crouch down if you need to.

809
02:29:40,399 --> 02:29:41,840
And action.

810
02:29:44,110 --> 02:29:45,149
Keep rolling baby.

811
02:29:45,870 --> 02:29:47,389
My eyes are crossing.

812
02:29:49,549 --> 02:29:50,049
Ooh.

813
02:29:54,569 --> 02:29:55,370
We're old man.

814
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:57,450
Player two, come to the set please.

815
02:29:57,450 --> 02:29:58,889
Player two, f**king New York.

816
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:06,569
It's time to put you in the spotlight.

817
02:30:07,129 --> 02:30:08,409
There's no scoring.

818
02:30:08,409 --> 02:30:11,690
Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.

819
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:15,719
Cry your eyes out.

820
02:30:16,360 --> 02:30:20,879
Action.

821
02:30:22,520 --> 02:30:23,639
That's it.

822
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:24,280
Keep it going.

823
02:30:25,899 --> 02:30:26,780
Stay on set.

824
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,440
Stand like you're the king of the world.

825
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:35,879
Action.

826
02:30:35,879 --> 02:30:44,799
Nearly there.

827
02:30:44,799 --> 02:30:45,840
That was like a ooh.

828
02:30:46,479 --> 02:30:48,000
It's kind of hard for me to get up out of bed.

829
02:30:48,959 --> 02:30:50,319
That's not like I'm powerful.

830
02:30:50,319 --> 02:30:52,639
That's the my I gotta do that otherwise I'll fall.

831
02:31:00,540 --> 02:31:01,500
Forward didn't do so hot.

832
02:31:04,190 --> 02:31:05,309
On the set please.

833
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:06,350
You got it.

834
02:31:06,989 --> 02:31:12,110
Freestyle dance.

835
02:31:12,909 --> 02:31:13,950
I don't want to I'm gonna do something else.

836
02:31:13,950 --> 02:31:15,629
Burn baby burn.

837
02:31:15,629 --> 02:31:17,790
It's time to stretch your funky stuff.

838
02:31:18,430 --> 02:31:22,270
Dance to the music and match the position of the hands to pose.

839
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:26,430
And action.

840
02:31:40,090 --> 02:31:43,610
That was me falling down by the way if you're curious.

841
02:31:47,639 --> 02:31:50,120
Remember I've got this fast f**k underneath me.

842
02:31:50,120 --> 02:31:50,840
You understand?

843
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:55,680
Look this fat f**king thing is underneath me.

844
02:31:56,639 --> 02:31:58,600
I'm gonna fall.

845
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:11,600
I want to jump so you can see what's here.

846
02:32:14,809 --> 02:32:15,770
You need it on set.

847
02:32:18,590 --> 02:32:20,510
Why does it cut me off every time?

848
02:32:22,409 --> 02:32:23,129
I ripped it.

849
02:32:23,129 --> 02:32:24,190
Uh oh not good.

850
02:32:24,829 --> 02:32:25,950
How it's like backwards.

851
02:32:27,790 --> 02:32:28,350
I'm rolling it up.

852
02:32:30,110 --> 02:32:32,670
I've had three times and measured those muscles.

853
02:32:33,469 --> 02:32:37,469
Action.

854
02:32:46,969 --> 02:32:51,680
And attempt left.

855
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,280
It's walloping time.

856
02:32:53,280 --> 02:33:00,239
Who sure pack a punch.

857
02:33:07,739 --> 02:33:10,940
Players one and two on set now please.

858
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:22,840
See who can get the hula hoop moving faster.

859
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:25,559
The faster it goes the more you score.

860
02:33:31,149 --> 02:33:32,590
And action.

861
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:38,540
Those hips baby.

862
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:39,579
Work those hips.

863
02:33:41,469 --> 02:33:42,750
You're in the groove now.

864
02:33:47,079 --> 02:33:48,520
Oh he got through it.

865
02:33:49,239 --> 02:33:59,100
Player three you need it on set.

866
02:34:03,639 --> 02:34:05,159
Can I get somebody to do a compilation?

867
02:34:05,159 --> 02:34:06,360
It's time for your starring moment.

868
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:12,459
Of every costume change just cut together faster.

869
02:34:12,459 --> 02:34:15,020
Show me a big cheesy grin.

870
02:34:15,659 --> 02:34:18,969
Action.

871
02:34:18,969 --> 02:34:20,959
Come on.

872
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:26,860
Come on.

873
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:29,420
You brought the house down beautiful.

874
02:34:32,510 --> 02:34:34,590
Player four to the set.

875
02:34:34,590 --> 02:34:36,350
I wish they would do one two three four.

876
02:34:36,350 --> 02:34:39,069
It just dude can I get all my scenes done as play one?

877
02:34:41,639 --> 02:34:43,959
It's time for your starring moment.

878
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:46,760
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

879
02:34:48,969 --> 02:34:50,170
Beg for mercy.

880
02:34:50,889 --> 02:34:56,559
Action.

881
02:34:58,920 --> 02:34:59,639
Keep it up.

882
02:34:59,639 --> 02:35:00,139
Please.

883
02:35:01,639 --> 02:35:02,579
Come on.

884
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:03,860
Please.

885
02:35:06,030 --> 02:35:09,420
Here comes another.

886
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:11,500
Give me the coolest look you've got.

887
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:18,559
Keep it up.

888
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:19,059
Keep it up.

889
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:24,959
Is it?

890
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:30,479
What a throw.

891
02:35:46,120 --> 02:35:47,479
I'm not taking off the suit.

892
02:35:47,479 --> 02:35:47,979
Keep it on.

893
02:35:48,600 --> 02:35:53,899
Here we go.

894
02:35:53,899 --> 02:35:56,379
The drums that are never used in any scenario.

895
02:35:56,379 --> 02:35:58,219
Let's all do the conga.

896
02:35:58,219 --> 02:36:02,139
Hit the drums as fast as you can to make your monkey dance faster.

897
02:36:09,879 --> 02:36:11,389
And action.

898
02:36:38,250 --> 02:36:39,129
That was an achievement.

899
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:40,809
I did that so fast.

900
02:36:41,770 --> 02:36:44,909
Punch the targets.

901
02:36:44,909 --> 02:36:45,950
I love punching this one.

902
02:36:48,030 --> 02:36:49,790
It's time for some training.

903
02:36:49,790 --> 02:36:51,950
Punch the targets until they disappear.

904
02:36:51,950 --> 02:36:54,590
The more you beat, the more you score.

905
02:36:54,590 --> 02:36:58,190
Remember, if you don't beat the target, you won't score any points.

906
02:36:59,149 --> 02:36:59,649
Action.

907
02:37:00,510 --> 02:37:02,139
Smash.

908
02:37:07,879 --> 02:37:10,760
Look like a million dollars, baby.

909
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,260
Smash.

910
02:37:14,379 --> 02:37:22,719
He's on the ropes, all right.

911
02:37:22,719 --> 02:37:23,219
Come on.

912
02:37:24,079 --> 02:37:29,950
Smash, bang, wallop.

913
02:37:30,889 --> 02:37:32,489
Jab, jab, jab.

914
02:37:32,489 --> 02:37:34,700
We have a world champion.

915
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:43,680
Player three, get yourself to the set.

916
02:37:53,659 --> 02:37:56,299
Let's see how strong you really are.

917
02:37:56,299 --> 02:37:59,340
Hit the pad three times and make the bell ring.

918
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:01,420
The harder you whack it, the more you score.

919
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:01,979
I like this.

920
02:38:01,979 --> 02:38:02,620
I don't want to rip it.

921
02:38:03,739 --> 02:38:04,739
Action.

922
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:25,950
Take this with you.

923
02:38:31,659 --> 02:38:32,159
Psycho.

924
02:38:32,860 --> 02:38:38,059
Player two, you need it on set.

925
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:46,250
And now it's your time to shine.

926
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:47,530
There's no scoring.

927
02:38:47,530 --> 02:38:50,569
Just follow my instructions and act like a star.

928
02:38:50,569 --> 02:38:51,069
Yeah.

929
02:38:53,229 --> 02:38:55,709
Show me a big cheesy grin.

930
02:38:59,170 --> 02:39:00,610
And action.

931
02:39:03,329 --> 02:39:04,450
Keep it going.

932
02:39:04,450 --> 02:39:09,020
They love you, baby.

933
02:39:09,739 --> 02:39:12,079
I did the same fucking face for the other one.

934
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:16,079
Player three, I need you on set.

935
02:39:16,079 --> 02:39:19,280
Can you keep the player two on set for more than a second?

936
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:26,860
Why can't I just do all my scenes first?

937
02:39:26,860 --> 02:39:29,020
It's time for your starring moment.

938
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:30,780
Smile in the camera, I guarantee it.

939
02:39:30,780 --> 02:39:32,059
And act your heart out.

940
02:39:32,059 --> 02:39:34,620
Do a big grin.

941
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:36,700
Give Frog a loving stare.

942
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:41,329
Action.

943
02:39:41,329 --> 02:39:43,860
That's it.

944
02:39:48,209 --> 02:39:49,090
Kiss the frog.

945
02:39:49,899 --> 02:39:50,399
Kiss?

946
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:56,690
And action.

947
02:39:58,610 --> 02:39:59,549
Come on.

948
02:39:59,549 --> 02:40:00,750
Show me what you got.

949
02:40:00,750 --> 02:40:03,139
Great.

950
02:40:03,139 --> 02:40:03,620
Stay there.

951
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:04,100
Did I get it?

952
02:40:04,899 --> 02:40:07,020
Like a hyena.

953
02:40:07,020 --> 02:40:12,690
Action.

954
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:36,659
You think you're going to be in my town?

955
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:38,120
Ah.

956
02:40:38,420 --> 02:40:41,440
Player four, get your butt on the set.

957
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:53,680
And baby bun, it's time to stretch your funky stuff.

958
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:58,079
Dance to the music and match the position of the hands to pose.

959
02:40:58,719 --> 02:41:02,000
Jared Leto is just a hyper ultra slowed down SpongeBob.

960
02:41:12,100 --> 02:41:16,500
It's just SpongeBob at like 0.2% speed.

961
02:41:20,739 --> 02:41:21,620
Oh my god.

962
02:41:27,309 --> 02:41:28,829
Nobody wants to be filmed doing this.

963
02:41:29,950 --> 02:41:31,309
Dance to the music.

964
02:41:37,459 --> 02:41:38,659
Shake your body down.

965
02:41:39,899 --> 02:41:41,260
That was some performance.

966
02:41:41,899 --> 02:41:44,940
Great with a capital groove in.

967
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:46,299
You chose this.

968
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,440
I didn't, I, my, come on.

969
02:41:51,440 --> 02:41:52,079
We're almost done?

970
02:41:58,690 --> 02:41:59,889
Oh, run the marathon.

971
02:41:59,889 --> 02:42:01,090
Here, do you remember this one?

972
02:42:01,569 --> 02:42:03,170
It's marathon time.

973
02:42:03,170 --> 02:42:05,090
Run the distance as fast as you can.

974
02:42:05,090 --> 02:42:07,090
But beware of overheating.

975
02:42:07,090 --> 02:42:10,129
Pace yourself and grab the bottles to cool more.

976
02:42:11,170 --> 02:42:22,290
Action, ladies and gentlemen.

977
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:26,049
Cool and refreshing.

978
02:42:28,610 --> 02:42:30,290
Look at that steam.

979
02:42:30,290 --> 02:42:31,969
Try slowing down to cool more.

980
02:42:32,690 --> 02:42:36,930
I'm going to catch up to you motherfucker.

981
02:42:37,819 --> 02:42:38,860
Oh shit.

982
02:42:38,860 --> 02:42:39,579
I got to get him.

983
02:42:40,379 --> 02:42:41,700
No.

984
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:42,479
That was some.

985
02:42:42,479 --> 02:42:53,870
On the set, please.

986
02:42:54,750 --> 02:42:55,629
I'm going to get my robe.

987
02:42:58,459 --> 02:42:59,819
No, not the top rope.

988
02:43:00,620 --> 02:43:01,739
Dodge the obstacles.

989
02:43:01,739 --> 02:43:03,739
No, another fucking tricycle.

990
02:43:03,739 --> 02:43:05,819
Drive your scooter through town.

991
02:43:05,819 --> 02:43:08,860
Dodge the obstacles, but hit the ramps to score.

992
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:34,350
And action.

993
02:43:34,350 --> 02:43:34,850
Turn.

994
02:43:36,350 --> 02:43:37,069
Go.

995
02:43:37,069 --> 02:43:37,569
Gas.

996
02:43:39,870 --> 02:43:40,370
Come on.

997
02:43:41,329 --> 02:43:42,690
Wee.

998
02:43:42,690 --> 02:43:48,850
That's gotta.

999
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:51,250
You said we have lift off.

1000
02:43:51,250 --> 02:43:55,860
I'm the paint work.

1001
02:43:56,579 --> 02:43:59,909
Have you got a license for that thing?

1002
02:44:01,860 --> 02:44:02,659
I'll just walk it.

1003
02:44:02,659 --> 02:44:03,139
I'll walk it.

1004
02:44:03,139 --> 02:44:03,639
I'm sorry.

1005
02:44:04,659 --> 02:44:07,680
I'll just walk it.

1006
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:08,399
I'm sorry.

1007
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:09,280
I didn't mean to do that.

1008
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:14,840
This is the worst one.

1009
02:44:16,739 --> 02:44:26,950
Next time, I think we'll use it.

1010
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:29,430
See what you guys are writing over here.

1011
02:44:29,430 --> 02:44:30,549
Come to the set, please.

1012
02:44:38,520 --> 02:44:41,479
It's time to put you in the spotlight.

1013
02:44:41,479 --> 02:44:42,760
There's no scoring.

1014
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:45,959
Just follow my instructions and show me your acting talent.

1015
02:44:48,770 --> 02:44:49,729
Kiss the frog.

1016
02:44:50,370 --> 02:44:57,969
Kiss my stomach.

1017
02:44:59,639 --> 02:45:01,299
Kiss my stomach.

1018
02:45:02,180 --> 02:45:04,979
Like a hyena.

1019
02:45:16,659 --> 02:45:21,620
Jesus.

1020
02:45:23,329 --> 02:45:25,090
You made it a play.

1021
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:26,290
Get your butt on the set.

1022
02:45:27,170 --> 02:45:30,870
We just need a few retakes.

1023
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:31,670
Retakes?

1024
02:45:31,670 --> 02:45:32,709
That wasn't good enough.

1025
02:45:32,709 --> 02:45:34,149
Act your heart out.

1026
02:45:34,149 --> 02:45:39,079
How far can you lean?

1027
02:45:39,959 --> 02:45:41,670
You don't want to like pop it?

1028
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:42,389
Or what?

1029
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:42,790
Pop it?

1030
02:45:45,479 --> 02:45:46,120
Keep it going.

1031
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:48,200
You brought the house down.

1032
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:48,680
Pretty good.

1033
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:49,399
Beautiful.

1034
02:45:50,280 --> 02:45:56,549
Player two, I need you on set, please.

1035
02:45:57,350 --> 02:46:01,350
They do this to make it so the person has to sit on the couch for that long.

1036
02:46:01,350 --> 02:46:03,750
Follow my instructions and act like a star.

1037
02:46:04,629 --> 02:46:09,920
How far can you lean?

1038
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:10,559
Pop it again.

1039
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:12,620
Action.

1040
02:46:13,159 --> 02:46:15,430
Come on.

1041
02:46:16,290 --> 02:46:17,090
Come on.

1042
02:46:17,090 --> 02:46:19,799
Fantastic.

1043
02:46:19,799 --> 02:46:20,680
You were a star.

1044
02:46:20,760 --> 02:46:21,799
That wasn't even a reshoot.

1045
02:46:21,799 --> 02:46:22,760
That was a new shoot.

1046
02:46:23,959 --> 02:46:25,159
What do you mean reshoot?

1047
02:46:25,799 --> 02:46:29,190
That's a wrap.

1048
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,829
That's it?

1049
02:46:29,829 --> 02:46:31,590
Let's go to the movies.

1050
02:46:31,590 --> 02:46:32,090
Here we go.

1051
02:47:02,040 --> 02:47:03,159
Private Eye.

1052
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:09,510
It was a quiet day for crime.

1053
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:13,840
Then bad news walked in.

1054
02:47:14,559 --> 02:47:22,000
Everyone wants to play the field.

1055
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:29,239
And no one wants to get caught.

1056
02:47:31,729 --> 02:47:34,209
Love can make us do terrible things.

1057
02:47:36,709 --> 02:47:38,629
Diabolical dancing.

1058
02:47:40,399 --> 02:47:42,239
Sensational scandal.

1059
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:46,799
Most people want one of two things.

1060
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:49,200
Love or money.

1061
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,360
Some want both.

1062
02:47:59,879 --> 02:48:02,040
Before you act on your suspicions,

1063
02:48:03,889 --> 02:48:05,250
get yourself some proof.

1064
02:48:06,879 --> 02:48:10,000
Get yourself a private eye.

1065
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:13,920
That was terrible.

1066
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:16,479
That was terrible.

1067
02:48:17,440 --> 02:48:20,260
I couldn't even follow half of that.

1068
02:48:25,409 --> 02:48:27,170
Like the kissing under the gut.

1069
02:48:28,610 --> 02:48:30,129
Let's might as well do it twice.

1070
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:47,719
I don't understand the line-up part.

1071
02:48:47,719 --> 02:48:48,840
It was just all one person.

1072
02:49:07,159 --> 02:49:08,200
Private Eye.

1073
02:49:12,639 --> 02:49:14,639
It was a quiet day for crime.

1074
02:49:17,079 --> 02:49:19,159
Then bad news walked in.

1075
02:49:19,799 --> 02:49:27,190
Everyone wants to play the field.

1076
02:49:27,989 --> 02:49:34,399
And no one wants to get caught.

1077
02:49:36,799 --> 02:49:39,360
Love can make us do terrible things.

1078
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:43,760
Diabolical dancing.

1079
02:49:45,590 --> 02:49:47,510
Sensational scandal.

1080
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:51,920
Most people want one of two things.

1081
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:54,319
Love or money.

1082
02:49:59,700 --> 02:50:01,540
Some want both.

1083
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:07,200
Before you act on your suspicions,

1084
02:50:09,059 --> 02:50:10,500
get yourself some proof.

1085
02:50:12,149 --> 02:50:15,360
Get yourself a private eye.

1086
02:50:17,559 --> 02:50:19,479
The double pop is the best part of that.

1087
02:50:21,250 --> 02:50:25,159
Oh man, that was probably the worst one so far.

1088
02:50:28,719 --> 02:50:31,600
Get yourself some proof.

1089
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:38,760
That like lifted up the stomach and walking forward.

1090
02:50:39,969 --> 02:50:55,010
Oh man, just name it trash.

1091
02:50:55,010 --> 02:50:58,530
Mark Wahlberg received critical fame for his role as Dirk Diggler in this movie.

1092
02:50:59,959 --> 02:51:00,440
Interesting.

1093
02:51:03,430 --> 02:51:05,350
What or who inspired the character of Chewbacca?

1094
02:51:06,549 --> 02:51:07,510
George Lucas' dog.

1095
02:51:11,750 --> 02:51:15,350
Got it.

1096
02:51:15,350 --> 02:51:18,549
Ghostbuster Peter Benkman claimed to have what college credentials?

1097
02:51:18,549 --> 02:51:19,190
Psychology.

1098
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:20,389
Psychologist.

1099
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:28,020
Thank you.

1100
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:31,059
In what city does the multi-culture Thanksgiving comedy What's Cookin' take place?

1101
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:35,940
I don't know.

1102
02:51:35,940 --> 02:51:36,659
Los Angeles.

1103
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:42,799
Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery was a remake of what?

1104
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:45,440
1965 James Bond flick that also starred Connery.

1105
02:51:47,079 --> 02:51:47,799
Say it twice.

1106
02:51:47,799 --> 02:51:48,200
I don't know.

1107
02:51:55,700 --> 02:51:56,180

1108
02:51:56,899 --> 02:52:08,180

02:52:18,690 --> 02:52:20,770
royalty in the mischievous satyr Puck?

02:52:21,489 --> 02:52:22,129
The Tempest.

1112
02:52:23,090 --> 02:52:26,530
I literally just pulled a random Shakespeare play out of my mind.

1113
02:52:30,370 --> 02:52:33,170
What film do Owen Wilson and Jennifer Lopez battle animals in the jungle?

1114
02:52:33,170 --> 02:52:33,649
Jumanji.

02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:43,030

1116
02:52:43,030 --> 02:52:43,829

1117
02:52:45,329 --> 02:52:45,809
Top Gun.

What Disney character portrayed Jacob Marley in Vicky's Christmas Carol?

I got that one.

What creature did Andy Zah was going to do it?

1122
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:13,350
I have some knowledge somewhere up there.

1123
02:53:13,989 --> 02:53:15,700
I've got a little bit of knowledge.

1124
02:53:26,549 --> 02:53:32,309
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the You're in the Movies Awards.

1125
02:53:36,239 --> 02:53:39,760
And now the moment you've all been waiting for.

1126
02:53:40,799 --> 02:53:43,600
The nominees for best actor are.

1127
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:46,000
I wish I could take individual pictures.

1128
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,040
Nominee one.

1129
02:53:50,549 --> 02:53:51,750

02:53:56,309 --> 02:53:57,510
Nominee four.

1132
02:53:57,510 --> 02:54:00,049
One day it'll make a puzzle.

1133
02:54:00,049 --> 02:54:01,250
Nominee four.

1134
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:07,520
But of course, there can only be one winner.

1135
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:13,639
And the You're in the Movies Award for best actor goes to.

1136
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:17,329
Shoulder.

1137
02:54:21,719 --> 02:54:25,000
Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award.

1138
02:54:25,719 --> 02:54:27,559
Some actors do it for the money.

1139
02:54:27,559 --> 02:54:28,680
Some actors do it for the fame.

1140
02:54:29,719 --> 02:54:31,000
I do it because I love it.

1141
02:54:31,879 --> 02:54:33,559
I care so much about it.

1142
02:54:33,559 --> 02:54:35,000
And I'm going to continue to do this.

1143
02:54:35,799 --> 02:54:39,190
Nobody's going to cheer for this.

1144
02:54:39,750 --> 02:54:41,319
Why are you not cheering?

1145
02:54:41,319 --> 02:54:41,959
Nobody cheers.

1146
02:54:47,090 --> 02:54:54,180
I'm all washed up.

1147
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:43,399
There's blood in there.

1148
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:53,620
All right.

1149
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:55,059
Oh, what do we get?

1150
02:55:55,059 --> 02:56:01,459
I think we need, I mean, I really, really want like ninja school.

1151
02:56:02,659 --> 02:56:03,379
Ghost team.

1152
02:56:03,379 --> 02:56:03,940
Look at this.

1153
02:56:03,940 --> 02:56:06,659
This steal the day.

1154
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:08,500
There's so many.

1155
02:56:12,979 --> 02:56:14,020
I'm doing one actor.

1156
02:56:14,020 --> 02:56:15,780
I want to unlock some shit.

1157
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:17,059
Is the picture in focus?

1158
02:56:19,620 --> 02:56:21,139
Yeah, I don't have the script.

1159
02:56:24,049 --> 02:56:25,090
Look, look, look now.

1160
02:56:25,090 --> 02:56:25,569
Look now.

1161
02:56:25,569 --> 02:56:26,069
Hold on.

1162
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:56,239
The music is too loud.

1163
02:56:56,239 --> 02:56:56,559
I know.

1164
02:56:56,559 --> 02:56:57,040
I agree.

1165
02:57:07,190 --> 02:57:09,030
LBRB LBRBY.

1166
02:57:09,670 --> 02:57:12,959
Don't lie to me.

1167
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:13,520
Okay.

1168
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:15,440
LBRB LBRBY.

1169
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:18,309
That was a lie.

1170
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:20,719
That was just a straight up lie.

1171
02:57:20,719 --> 02:57:21,040
All right.

1172
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:21,840
Prehistoric power.

1173
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:24,319
Four adventures go in search of a forgotten world and get more than they bargained for.

1174
02:57:24,319 --> 02:57:25,600
I'm going to do this one quick.

1175
02:57:25,600 --> 02:57:26,399
Just one actor.

1176
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:27,600
Just me.

1177
02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:28,239
Just one actor.

1178
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:32,690
Is the lighting okay?

1179
02:57:32,690 --> 02:57:35,010
Now let's position the camera.

1180
02:57:35,010 --> 02:57:35,409
Just me.

1181
02:57:36,209 --> 02:57:37,809
Welcome to the cut out.

1182
02:57:37,809 --> 02:57:39,159
Great.

1183
02:57:39,799 --> 02:57:43,000
Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.

1184
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:45,879
Please hold on.

1185
02:57:47,639 --> 02:57:49,639
Cut out complete.

1186
02:57:49,639 --> 02:57:51,479
Now get back in front of the camera.

1187
02:57:52,200 --> 02:57:57,000
Try playing around with the cut out style to see the best results.

1188
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,799
Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?

1189
02:58:03,090 --> 02:58:03,329
Yes.

1190
02:58:05,010 --> 02:58:07,200
How many actors are there?

1191
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:09,840
Choose the correct number.

1192
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:10,559
Option screen?

1193
02:58:12,850 --> 02:58:13,329
Options.

1194
02:58:13,329 --> 02:58:14,690
Well, let me just do this quick quick.

1195
02:58:16,129 --> 02:58:17,729
Explore, explore, expedition later.

1196
02:58:17,729 --> 02:58:20,530
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.

1197
02:58:20,530 --> 02:58:23,489
This will decide which road you play in the movie.

1198
02:58:24,770 --> 02:58:29,059
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.

1199
02:58:29,620 --> 02:58:32,180
This will decide which road you play in the movie.

1200
02:58:32,180 --> 02:58:32,979
Oh, that's gross.

1201
02:58:49,170 --> 02:58:50,209
It's small.

1202
02:58:50,209 --> 02:58:52,870
All right.

1203
02:58:52,870 --> 02:58:54,709
I'm just going to fuck up this whole production.

1204
02:58:54,709 --> 02:58:55,110
I don't care.

1205
02:58:56,870 --> 02:58:59,319
Let's see how much I can fuck this whole production up.

1206
02:58:59,319 --> 02:59:00,680
Run as fast as you can.

1207
02:59:01,239 --> 02:59:03,879
Reach the gate to escape the charging bull.

1208
02:59:04,520 --> 02:59:05,879
I'm just going straight up who gives a shit.

1209
02:59:05,879 --> 02:59:06,379
You know what I mean?

1210
02:59:07,559 --> 02:59:10,409
Action.

1211
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:16,879
He sure got a mean look about him, don't he?

1212
02:59:18,850 --> 02:59:20,209
Yee-haw.

1213
02:59:20,209 --> 02:59:20,709
Stay back.

1214
02:59:20,709 --> 02:59:22,450
His arms moving to gain speed.

1215
02:59:22,450 --> 02:59:22,950
Stay back.

1216
02:59:23,969 --> 02:59:26,870
He sure got a mean look about him, don't he?

1217
02:59:29,379 --> 02:59:33,799
Oh, we dropped some fucking frames.

1218
02:59:33,799 --> 02:59:35,000
Great work, Slim.

1219
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:36,440
You rule the rodeo.

1220
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:38,360
I was going to have a drink in my hand the whole time.

1221
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:42,159
I think that's a fun concept.

1222
02:59:45,379 --> 02:59:47,379
Player one, get yourself to the set.

1223
02:59:51,879 --> 02:59:53,559
The FPS is so good.

1224
02:59:53,559 --> 02:59:55,879
It's time for your starring moment.

1225
02:59:55,879 --> 02:59:58,600
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

1226
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:06,399
Stroke your chin like you're deep in thought.

1227
03:00:07,440 --> 03:00:08,799
And action.

1228
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:11,379
Keep it up.

1229
03:00:11,379 --> 03:00:12,020
Keep it up.

1230
03:00:13,889 --> 03:00:15,329
Let's try one more.

1231
03:00:16,129 --> 03:00:20,370
Point at the camera and laugh.

1232
03:00:23,649 --> 03:00:24,149
Action.

1233
03:00:27,829 --> 03:00:33,489
It was fantastic.

1234
03:00:33,489 --> 03:00:35,649
You were a star.

1235
03:00:38,709 --> 03:00:40,069
Now it's time to really fuck it all up.

1236
03:00:43,920 --> 03:00:44,639
Watch this shit.

1237
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:50,319
Player one, to the set.

1238
03:00:50,879 --> 03:00:57,750
For your mind.

1239
03:01:00,069 --> 03:01:01,750
It's time to work your mind.

1240
03:01:02,309 --> 03:01:04,709
Memorize the symbol on the stone block.

1241
03:01:04,709 --> 03:01:06,469
Then point to the right scroll.

1242
03:01:07,750 --> 03:01:10,709
What am I doing?

1243
03:01:10,709 --> 03:01:12,069
And action.

1244
03:01:12,790 --> 03:01:13,909
Remember the symbol.

1245
03:01:19,559 --> 03:01:24,639
Look at those fucking sweaty pit stains.

1246
03:01:24,639 --> 03:01:26,079
You'll grasp at shadows.

1247
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:28,879
Now concentrate.

1248
03:01:30,450 --> 03:01:32,290
Concentrate, young apprentice.

1249
03:01:32,370 --> 03:01:34,049
It's 110 degrees in Vegas.

1250
03:01:34,049 --> 03:01:34,610
Give me a break.

1251
03:01:36,319 --> 03:01:36,819
Wrong.

1252
03:01:37,440 --> 03:01:38,639
You need more training.

1253
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:43,319
Got the right one.

1254
03:01:43,959 --> 03:01:45,319
Read the symbol well.

1255
03:01:47,969 --> 03:01:49,090
Clear your mind.

1256
03:01:49,809 --> 03:01:51,969
Use the power of your mind.

1257
03:01:53,809 --> 03:01:55,489
That was not good.

1258
03:01:56,209 --> 03:01:57,569
Place that in your mind.

1259
03:01:59,750 --> 03:02:00,709
Perfect.

1260
03:02:00,709 --> 03:02:02,709
You are a being of light.

1261
03:02:03,510 --> 03:02:08,290
I'm gonna laugh my ass off if this turns out to be a good movie.

1262
03:02:09,010 --> 03:02:10,129
What am I doing?

1263
03:02:10,129 --> 03:02:10,930
I'm trying to skip fast.

1264
03:02:10,930 --> 03:02:13,090
Player one, I need you on set, please.

1265
03:02:13,090 --> 03:02:14,209
I don't want to do that one, I want to stop.

1266
03:02:15,250 --> 03:02:16,879
All right, here we go.

1267
03:02:18,159 --> 03:02:20,559
It's time for your starring moment.

1268
03:02:20,559 --> 03:02:23,280
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

1269
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,139
I want you to sneeze.

1270
03:02:27,139 --> 03:02:28,340
All right, I can do this good.

1271
03:02:29,299 --> 03:02:32,729
Action.

1272
03:02:34,389 --> 03:02:35,190
That's it.

1273
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:36,159
Keep it going.

1274
03:02:37,360 --> 03:02:40,559
Hear that?

1275
03:02:40,559 --> 03:02:42,760
What a moment.

1276
03:02:42,760 --> 03:02:50,610
It's right in your fucking eyes.

1277
03:02:51,489 --> 03:02:57,959
Player one, on the set, please.

1278
03:03:01,829 --> 03:03:04,149
Do my famous life is pain monologue.

1279
03:03:04,549 --> 03:03:05,510
Well, there's no audio.

1280
03:03:06,149 --> 03:03:07,520
What is this?

1281
03:03:08,079 --> 03:03:10,479
Imagine the biggest noise you can.

1282
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:13,360
Play the instruments to make a racket.

1283
03:03:13,360 --> 03:03:15,840
The faster you go, the more you score.

1284
03:03:16,959 --> 03:03:20,420
Action.

1285
03:03:20,420 --> 03:03:21,889
Bang the congas.

1286
03:03:28,719 --> 03:03:29,760
Hit the tambourine.

1287
03:03:34,739 --> 03:03:35,860
Stroke the child.

1288
03:03:40,129 --> 03:03:41,090
There's a gong.

1289
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:49,920
I did it twice.

1290
03:03:50,799 --> 03:03:55,250
Shake that maraca.

1291
03:04:01,430 --> 03:04:02,549
Crash that zimbo.

1292
03:04:06,049 --> 03:04:08,049
That was great.

1293
03:04:08,049 --> 03:04:09,729
You sure can make a racket.

1294
03:04:10,930 --> 03:04:12,950
Thank you.

1295
03:04:22,049 --> 03:04:23,170
Those are perfect teeth, though.

1296
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:26,399
They really are.

1297
03:04:26,399 --> 03:04:26,959
They're nice.

1298
03:04:27,760 --> 03:04:32,520
All right, last one.

1299
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:34,440
Player one, come to the set, please.

1300
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:36,280
I can open up all the...

1301
03:04:36,280 --> 03:04:37,000
I'm going to try that.

1302
03:04:37,879 --> 03:04:41,620
Cup and the pea.

1303
03:04:42,340 --> 03:04:44,260
Oh, this thing again.

1304
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:45,700
Now, you must have seen this before.

1305
03:04:46,420 --> 03:04:47,860
Watch the cups carefully.

1306
03:04:47,860 --> 03:04:48,659
Then point at the cup.

1307
03:04:48,659 --> 03:04:49,700
I've done this like 10 times.

1308
03:04:49,700 --> 03:04:50,899
You can't just take one of these

1309
03:04:50,899 --> 03:04:52,739
that I've already done like a hundred times.

1310
03:04:54,260 --> 03:04:55,379
Hmm, which one is it?

1311
03:04:55,379 --> 03:04:55,860
Which cup?

1312
03:04:55,860 --> 03:04:56,899
Which ones are going into?

1313
03:04:57,459 --> 03:04:58,579
Round and round they go.

1314
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:03,540
Okay, which cup?

1315
03:05:06,389 --> 03:05:07,989
You took your eye off the cup.

1316
03:05:08,709 --> 03:05:15,940
Round and round they go.

1317
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:20,180
Okay.

1318
03:05:20,959 --> 03:05:21,760
Which cup?

1319
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:24,479
You found it.

1320
03:05:25,120 --> 03:05:27,200
There's no pulling the wool over your eyes.

1321
03:05:28,479 --> 03:05:35,299
Round and round they go.

1322
03:05:39,540 --> 03:05:41,540
Okay, which cup?

1323
03:05:45,889 --> 03:05:47,649
You've got your wits about you.

1324
03:05:47,649 --> 03:05:48,930
Boomers don't have fun.

1325
03:05:51,250 --> 03:05:52,129
Fucking boomers.

1326
03:05:54,079 --> 03:05:58,159
Always ruining our 2003 webcam video games.

1327
03:05:58,159 --> 03:06:00,559
That's a wrap.

1328
03:06:00,559 --> 03:06:01,280
All right, here we go.

1329
03:06:01,280 --> 03:06:02,399
Let's see how shitty this one is.

1330
03:06:02,959 --> 03:06:03,520
Which is me.

1331
03:06:09,559 --> 03:06:10,760
And then I'm going to unlock all of them.

1332
03:06:35,399 --> 03:06:38,040
It started with a meeting of great minds.

1333
03:06:41,350 --> 03:06:46,579
And a plan to travel to a lost world.

1334
03:06:50,450 --> 03:06:53,329
Journey to a land never beheld by man,

1335
03:06:53,329 --> 03:06:54,690
woman, nor child.

1336
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:01,920
Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before.

1337
03:07:03,379 --> 03:07:05,379
Prehistoric paradise.

1338
03:07:09,510 --> 03:07:12,309
Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities.

1339
03:07:13,270 --> 03:07:15,700
Ground-breaking discoveries.

1340
03:07:16,899 --> 03:07:19,270
I just kicked it out of the room.

1341
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:27,840
Terrifying monsters.

1342
03:07:28,719 --> 03:07:31,350
Older than your dreams.

1343
03:07:31,350 --> 03:07:34,149
Scarier than your nightmares.

1344
03:07:35,110 --> 03:07:37,110
A daring rescue mission.

1345
03:07:37,590 --> 03:07:44,229
Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is prehistoric paradise.

1346
03:08:02,309 --> 03:08:03,270
God damn it.

1347
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:08,680
With the drink being eaten,

1348
03:08:08,680 --> 03:08:10,040
and then with the drink inside.

1349
03:08:11,270 --> 03:08:12,629
Oh, that was dog shit.

1350
03:08:12,629 --> 03:08:14,469
But let's do it again, why not?

1351
03:08:14,469 --> 03:08:15,430
I have to do it twice.

1352
03:08:16,309 --> 03:08:20,870
Drinking every photo.

1353
03:08:25,989 --> 03:08:26,629
What a joke.

1354
03:08:27,430 --> 03:08:29,520
I don't have any more juice left.

1355
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:30,719
I can't even, speaking of drinks.

1356
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:50,530
Why am I hands in the air for the meeting shot?

1357
03:08:50,530 --> 03:08:53,329
Because I sat there for like, with the drink.

1358
03:08:53,329 --> 03:08:55,809
It started with a meeting of great minds.

1359
03:08:55,889 --> 03:08:57,889
It actually goes, I can't.

1360
03:08:58,850 --> 03:09:04,469
And a plan to travel to a lost world.

1361
03:09:08,360 --> 03:09:12,600
Journey to a land never beheld by man, woman, nor child.

1362
03:09:15,620 --> 03:09:19,860
Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before.

1363
03:09:20,899 --> 03:09:23,270
Prehistoric paradise.

1364
03:09:27,360 --> 03:09:30,159
Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities.

1365
03:09:31,719 --> 03:09:33,719
Ground-breaking discoveries.

1366
03:09:35,319 --> 03:09:36,760
Enormous eggs.

1367
03:09:43,780 --> 03:09:45,459
Terrifying monsters.

1368
03:09:47,489 --> 03:09:51,969
Older than your dreams, scarier than your nightmares.

1369
03:09:53,090 --> 03:09:54,850
A daring rescue mission.

1370
03:09:55,649 --> 03:10:02,370
Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is prehistoric paradise.

1371
03:10:02,370 --> 03:10:03,250
I fucking love it.

1372
03:10:04,290 --> 03:10:08,690
Uh, no, I don't want to replay it.

1373
03:10:09,649 --> 03:10:12,399
Of course I want to save that movie.

1374
03:10:17,409 --> 03:10:18,850
We'll watch them all once through.

1375
03:10:19,809 --> 03:10:20,850
I will mute my mic.

1376
03:10:21,489 --> 03:10:22,450
So you don't hear me like.

1377
03:10:25,010 --> 03:10:25,809
At the end of this frame.

1378
03:10:34,229 --> 03:10:34,729
Dino.

1379
03:10:36,549 --> 03:10:37,350
Don't mute.

1380
03:10:37,350 --> 03:10:37,909
Don't mute.

1381
03:10:37,909 --> 03:10:38,409
Oh, okay.

1382
03:10:39,270 --> 03:10:43,829
Well, just a half for, you know, for editing and stuff.

1383
03:10:43,829 --> 03:10:46,479
You need to direct his commentary.

1384
03:10:46,479 --> 03:10:47,200
What can I give you there?

1385
03:10:51,459 --> 03:10:53,700
Katie Holmes tries to reconnect with her estranged family

1386
03:10:53,700 --> 03:10:55,139
by hosting Thanksgiving in what film?

1387
03:10:57,430 --> 03:10:59,110
Uh, I don't know.

1388
03:10:59,110 --> 03:10:59,610
Oops.

1389
03:11:00,149 --> 03:11:05,780
Shrek's line, that'll do, donkey.

1390
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:07,540
That'll do is inspired by what film?

1391
03:11:08,899 --> 03:11:09,399
Uh, Bape.

1392
03:11:10,629 --> 03:11:11,590
Yes, I knew it.

1393
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:12,090
I told you.

1394
03:11:12,709 --> 03:11:18,549
What does Bill Murray do for a living in the film Scrooged?

1395
03:11:19,559 --> 03:11:20,440
Uh, he's an accountant.

1396
03:11:27,909 --> 03:11:30,469
What 1944 Judy Garland film features the song

1397
03:11:30,469 --> 03:11:31,750
Have Yourself a Merry Merry Christmas?

1398
03:11:32,309 --> 03:11:33,510
It's not The Wizard of Oz.

1399
03:11:34,069 --> 03:11:43,969
What actor surprises the Ann Darrow role?

1400
03:11:43,969 --> 03:11:44,469
I don't know.

1401
03:11:51,360 --> 03:11:55,760
Director Doug Liman helped popularize a Los Angeles subculture in this film.

1402
03:11:56,899 --> 03:12:03,719
Um, I was gonna say, I was gonna say like hippies.

1403
03:12:04,799 --> 03:12:15,799
Bryce, the dog, oh, this is what has started to, I'm like, um, I don't know.

1404
03:12:15,799 --> 03:12:19,479
In 2001, what song does the computer howl sing as it is being shut down?

1405
03:12:19,479 --> 03:12:20,120
Happy birthday.

1406
03:12:21,319 --> 03:12:22,280
Happy birthday to you.

1407
03:12:30,840 --> 03:12:33,879
Um, The Aristocrats.

1408
03:12:33,879 --> 03:12:34,520
The Aristocats.

1409
03:12:39,889 --> 03:12:42,770
Name the settlement where Luke and Ben first meet Han Solo.

1410
03:12:44,129 --> 03:12:46,340
Um, District Nine.

1411
03:12:46,979 --> 03:12:54,209

03:13:07,139 --> 03:13:07,700
Godzilla.

1416
03:13:18,020 --> 03:13:19,459
Well, I don't know shit, apparently.

1417
03:13:22,020 --> 03:13:24,420
Apparently, German just don't know shit.

1418
03:13:30,639 --> 03:13:36,479

I don't know.

1429
03:14:06,899 --> 03:14:07,700
One of these are all me.

1430
03:14:07,700 --> 03:14:14,040

1431
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:16,180

03:14:32,520 --> 03:14:34,020
I got something to say.

1437
03:14:35,170 --> 03:14:41,799
Hey, all of you are so smart and so awesome.

Don't let go.

03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:56,639
Okay, I'm gonna...

1441
03:14:56,639 --> 03:14:57,440
I need some more juice.

1442
03:14:58,079 --> 03:14:59,590
What are the cheats?

1443
03:15:01,010 --> 03:15:01,809
Ooh, more films.

03:15:13,329 --> 03:15:14,049
You're in the movies, cheats.

1449
03:15:15,409 --> 03:15:17,170
Do you guys want me to just start cheating?

1450
03:15:18,049 --> 03:15:19,399
What do you think I am?

1451
03:15:19,399 --> 03:15:21,159
Some kind of fucking non-video gamer?

1452
03:15:22,959 --> 03:15:23,440
What do they do?

1453
03:15:26,370 --> 03:15:28,450
Unlock all trailers and directors mode.

1454
03:15:28,450 --> 03:15:29,809
Enter these commands simultaneously.

1455
03:15:29,809 --> 03:15:30,290
Option screen.

1456
03:15:30,290 --> 03:15:31,649

1457
03:15:33,489 --> 03:15:34,049
So hit them...

1458
03:15:34,049 --> 03:15:35,170
Hold them all at the same time.

1459
03:15:35,170 --> 03:15:37,090
LBRB, LBRBY.

1460
03:15:37,090 --> 03:15:37,969
In the options menu?

1461
03:15:40,040 --> 03:15:41,559
LBRB, LBRBY.

1462
03:15:41,559 --> 03:15:43,000
This is the options screen.

1463
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:44,200
LBRB, LBRBY.

1464
03:15:45,159 --> 03:15:55,079
Did it work?

1465
03:15:55,079 --> 03:15:56,040
LBRB, LBR...

1466
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:57,559
How do I hit LBRB twice?

1467
03:15:58,950 --> 03:15:59,350
What, like...

1468
03:16:03,059 --> 03:16:03,299
Hold...

1469
03:16:05,329 --> 03:16:05,809
Hold them.

1470
03:16:07,329 --> 03:16:09,489
Why does it just not say LBRBY?

1471
03:16:10,950 --> 03:16:12,870
LBRB, LBRBY.

1472
03:16:13,590 --> 03:16:13,829
What?

1473
03:16:17,379 --> 03:16:18,260
Hold them twice.

1474
03:16:25,219 --> 03:16:26,739
That's bumper trigger...

1475
03:16:26,739 --> 03:16:28,260
That's LLT is trigger.

1476
03:16:29,059 --> 03:16:31,959
Trigger it, hold all of them.

1477
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:00,239
What?

1478
03:17:00,239 --> 03:17:07,010
What does this do?

1479
03:17:07,569 --> 03:17:12,850
I can make my own movie...

1480
03:17:12,850 --> 03:17:13,969
Welcome to directing.

1481
03:17:13,969 --> 03:17:15,329
You can create your own movie.

1482
03:17:16,209 --> 03:17:18,690
Record footage, change shots and record your own audio?

1483
03:17:20,049 --> 03:17:22,520
I want a new script.

1484
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:26,120
Uh, whoops-a-daisy.

1485
03:17:26,120 --> 03:17:27,799
Just found probably the fucking best.

1486
03:17:27,799 --> 03:17:28,920
How do I record audio though?

1487
03:17:28,920 --> 03:17:30,760
I don't have a way to record it on the Xbox.

1488
03:17:31,559 --> 03:17:34,870
Movie viewer, shots and audio.

1489
03:17:36,229 --> 03:17:38,049
Okay.

1490
03:17:40,549 --> 03:17:41,350

03:17:42,879 --> 03:17:45,200
Press down on the D-pad to move to shots section.

1492
03:17:47,270 --> 03:17:48,469
Arrange and edit your shots.

1493
03:17:50,180 --> 03:17:52,100
Use the left and right of the D-pad to select a shot.

1494
03:17:52,100 --> 03:17:53,379

1495
03:17:55,270 --> 03:17:57,430
Delete the shot or press X to record footage.

1496
03:17:58,549 --> 03:17:59,989
Keep an eye on the shot meter when adding shots.

1497
03:17:59,989 --> 03:18:02,069
It shows how close you are to the maximum movie size.

1498
03:18:02,709 --> 03:18:05,190
When it's almost full, you may need to delete shots before you can add more.

1499
03:18:05,909 --> 03:18:08,149
Press down on the D-pad and go to the audio channel.

1500
03:18:08,149 --> 03:18:08,389
Fuck.

1501
03:18:09,270 --> 03:18:11,280
I don't have a way to record audio.

1502
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:15,440

1503
03:18:16,159 --> 03:18:17,719

1505
03:18:20,209 --> 03:18:21,090
You're not ready to direct a movie.

1506
03:18:21,090 --> 03:18:21,889
What do you need when you finish?

1507
03:18:21,889 --> 03:18:23,090
Use the director to save your correction.

1508
03:18:23,090 --> 03:18:24,530
Set the script lets you make your movie by playing the game.

1509
03:18:24,530 --> 03:18:26,610
Set the movie lets you watch and upload it in the movie theater.

1510
03:18:26,610 --> 03:18:27,250
You need further help?

1511
03:18:27,250 --> 03:18:27,569
Okay.

1512
03:18:28,530 --> 03:18:29,090
Add a shot.

1513
03:18:31,280 --> 03:18:31,920
Oh no.

1514
03:18:34,840 --> 03:18:35,559
Oh no.

1515
03:18:36,979 --> 03:18:38,500
Oh god no.

1516
03:18:39,379 --> 03:18:40,659
This is too much to do.

1517
03:19:14,719 --> 03:19:15,440
Fuck.

1518
03:19:15,440 --> 03:19:23,280
What is this?

1519
03:19:23,280 --> 03:19:24,079
People on fire?

1520
03:19:24,799 --> 03:19:29,809
I gotta unlock the other films.

1521
03:19:29,809 --> 03:19:30,530
Yeah, that's right.

1522
03:19:39,959 --> 03:19:41,159
Uh, this is from the first one.

1523
03:19:46,530 --> 03:19:47,569
Is it ghosts?

1524
03:19:47,569 --> 03:19:48,850
I don't even see this stuff.

1525
03:19:50,209 --> 03:19:51,809
I need to, I want to do these ones.

1526
03:19:52,370 --> 03:19:53,569
I want to do the one where you're a ghost.

1527
03:19:54,290 --> 03:20:02,280
Okay, hold on.

1528
03:20:03,239 --> 03:20:03,559
No!

1529
03:20:04,200 --> 03:20:12,180
Do the movies first?

1530
03:20:13,379 --> 03:20:15,059
Yeah, I feel like that's a, hold on.

1531
03:20:15,059 --> 03:20:18,000
Record actors.

1532
03:20:23,719 --> 03:20:25,479
Action three, actor three, action one.

1533
03:20:26,200 --> 03:20:26,680
Let's go.

1534
03:20:29,700 --> 03:20:30,260
Be in the car.

1535
03:20:30,899 --> 03:20:40,690
Okay.

1536
03:20:40,690 --> 03:20:43,489
All right, that seems all right.

1537
03:20:44,549 --> 03:20:45,110
Review that.

1538
03:20:45,750 --> 03:20:48,680
Okay, that makes sense.

1539
03:20:50,159 --> 03:20:50,639
Looks good.

1540
03:20:51,200 --> 03:20:51,920
Done.

1541
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:55,799
Is that in there?

1542
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:56,120
Okay.

1543
03:20:57,280 --> 03:21:00,319
Uh, let's record this, uh, record this actor.

1544
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:02,870
Should I?

1545
03:21:02,870 --> 03:21:08,399
I'm not gonna dance in the shower.

1546
03:21:08,399 --> 03:21:20,040
Okay.

1547
03:21:20,040 --> 03:21:51,120
Fuck, I'm just, actor one.

1548
03:21:51,120 --> 03:21:52,229
There we go.

1549
03:21:52,229 --> 03:22:08,069
I can control myself.

1550
03:22:08,069 --> 03:22:17,590
What the hell am I supposed to do here?

1551
03:22:22,260 --> 03:22:25,750
Is this YMCA?

1552
03:22:25,750 --> 03:22:28,760
Young man, don't you need to feel down?

1553
03:22:28,760 --> 03:22:30,040
I say young man.

1554
03:22:49,559 --> 03:23:13,649
Okay, what else you got?

1555
03:23:13,649 --> 03:23:14,290
Come on, give it to me.

1556
03:23:14,290 --> 03:23:15,170
Throw it at me, anything.

1557
03:23:19,559 --> 03:23:20,920
Um, I don't know, okay.

1558
03:23:20,920 --> 03:23:22,850
And then, record actors.

1559
03:23:26,040 --> 03:23:27,079
One of the ghosts.

1560
03:23:27,079 --> 03:23:43,809
Let's watch it.

1561
03:23:43,889 --> 03:23:50,450
Movie done.

1562
03:23:50,450 --> 03:23:52,260
Audio.

1563
03:23:52,260 --> 03:23:53,299
Choose soundtrack.

1564
03:23:53,299 --> 03:24:05,969
I have no way to record audio.

1565
03:24:05,969 --> 03:24:06,690
I don't have one of those.

1566
03:24:06,690 --> 03:24:08,209
I bought this thing secondhand.

1567
03:24:08,209 --> 03:24:18,389
All right, let's walk, let's go.

1568
03:24:33,090 --> 03:24:34,530
Am I controlling the wizard?

1569
03:24:47,959 --> 03:24:48,840
I'm just dead.

1570
03:24:49,639 --> 03:24:51,239
Okay, nice.

1571
03:25:02,420 --> 03:25:03,860
Well, this one sucks.

1572
03:25:06,020 --> 03:25:07,379
All right, I want to, I want to listen to the,

1573
03:25:07,379 --> 03:25:08,420
I want to unlock more movies.

1574
03:25:15,170 --> 03:25:15,649
Fuck that one.

1575
03:25:15,649 --> 03:25:16,370
That one was terrible.

1576
03:25:16,930 --> 03:25:20,159
Do I have any kind of USB headset?

1577
03:25:20,159 --> 03:25:20,639
I don't.

1578
03:25:24,690 --> 03:25:28,399
I don't have any USB headset at all.

1579
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:30,770
All right, let me see.

1580
03:25:30,770 --> 03:25:31,649
Hold on, make it a movie.

1581
03:25:31,649 --> 03:25:33,170
Do I have access to the other ones?

1582
03:25:35,360 --> 03:25:36,159
I do.

1583
03:25:36,159 --> 03:25:36,639
It worked.

1584
03:25:36,639 --> 03:25:37,680
It actually did work.

1585
03:25:37,680 --> 03:25:38,559
No, it didn't.

1586
03:25:38,559 --> 03:25:42,579
Deity for a day.

1587
03:25:44,229 --> 03:25:45,030
Super funk.

1588
03:25:47,219 --> 03:25:48,020
Music things.

1589
03:25:51,909 --> 03:25:53,350
Vampire villas.

1590
03:25:56,920 --> 03:25:57,159
This one.

1591
03:25:57,159 --> 03:25:58,520
Let's check our equipment is working.

1592
03:25:58,520 --> 03:25:59,559
I need, I gotta get more.

1593
03:25:59,559 --> 03:26:00,760
I gotta get more ice.

1594
03:26:00,760 --> 03:26:01,319
I'll be right back.

1595
03:26:01,959 --> 03:26:02,459
Ice.

1596
03:26:03,159 --> 03:29:06,680
It's been three and a half hours.

1597
03:29:06,680 --> 03:29:07,559
It seems like one.

1598
03:29:09,110 --> 03:29:10,709
Yeah, it kind of is going by, isn't it?

1599
03:29:11,510 --> 03:29:12,950
Time flies when you have fun doing it.

1600
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:27,840
I'm on my camera right now.

1601
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:28,340
Okay.

1602
03:29:28,959 --> 03:29:33,569
You started three.

1603
03:29:33,569 --> 03:29:35,010
I had three and a half hours ago, yeah?

1604
03:29:39,559 --> 03:29:40,120
All right.

1605
03:29:40,120 --> 03:29:45,780
I'm just going to make a quick Bae Breeze.

1606
03:29:45,780 --> 03:29:46,819
We'll get started again.

1607
03:29:47,459 --> 03:30:03,440
It's cranberry juice.

1608
03:30:04,799 --> 03:30:07,680
You want to know if you're of the age of 30 and you can drink.

1609
03:30:09,350 --> 03:30:09,989
Shot of vodka.

1610
03:30:11,559 --> 03:30:12,520
Half cranberry juice.

1611
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:15,000
Little more than half.

1612
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:16,040
I fucked it up.

1613
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:19,719
Half pineapple juice.

1614
03:30:20,680 --> 03:30:21,319
It's a Bae Breeze.

1615
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:27,280
I ruined it.

1616
03:30:27,280 --> 03:30:29,280
How about vodka cranberries?

1617
03:30:30,239 --> 03:30:30,799
Yes, I know.

1618
03:30:30,799 --> 03:30:32,479
I know the hair just came down to the perfect spot.

1619
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:37,459
Vodka cranberry, vodka pineapple are two timeless drinks.

1620
03:30:38,020 --> 03:30:40,680
This is a Bae Breeze.

1621
03:30:41,860 --> 03:30:43,700
You've never had a fucking Bae Breeze before?

1622
03:30:44,659 --> 03:30:45,459
Okay.

1623
03:30:46,680 --> 03:30:47,000
I don't know.

1624
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:48,600
I just took a shower like three hours ago.

1625
03:30:48,600 --> 03:30:49,959
I don't know why it's in here.

1626
03:30:49,959 --> 03:30:50,920
Man, that got collected.

1627
03:30:51,719 --> 03:30:53,239
Okay.

1628
03:30:53,239 --> 03:30:55,559
Anyways, picture isn't focused.

1629
03:30:55,559 --> 03:30:56,059
Yes, it is.

1630
03:30:57,489 --> 03:30:59,569
Is the lighting okay in here?

1631
03:30:59,569 --> 03:31:01,170
Check the light meter to be sure.

1632
03:31:05,159 --> 03:31:07,159
Now, let's position the camera.

1633
03:31:07,719 --> 03:31:10,840
Make sure everyone can fit themselves into the outline.

1634
03:31:10,840 --> 03:31:12,840
He's drunk at five o'clock.

1635
03:31:12,840 --> 03:31:14,120
These are Bae Breezes.

1636
03:31:14,120 --> 03:31:15,559
They're not, like, I'm not drinking them.

1637
03:31:15,559 --> 03:31:16,680
They're straight vodka.

1638
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:19,399
It's like a half a shot.

1639
03:31:19,399 --> 03:31:23,239
It's like I can drink like 10 of these and sing.

1640
03:31:27,559 --> 03:31:29,479
I could sing the entire alphabet.

1641
03:31:29,479 --> 03:31:33,969
Welcome to the Cutout Studio.

1642
03:31:33,969 --> 03:31:37,649
This is where we separate your image from the background.

1643
03:31:37,649 --> 03:31:41,170
Select Start Cutout Studio to continue.

1644
03:31:41,170 --> 03:31:41,889
You would sing.

1645
03:31:45,459 --> 03:31:47,059
I tell you, I'm not drunk at all.

1646
03:31:47,059 --> 03:31:48,340
I'll sing to prove it.

1647
03:31:48,340 --> 03:31:49,540
Like, okay, weirdo.

1648
03:31:54,340 --> 03:31:56,899
You know that thing that people do when they're shit-faced

1649
03:31:56,899 --> 03:31:58,659
at a bar at a karaoke night?

1650
03:31:58,659 --> 03:31:59,219
Hold on.

1651
03:32:03,110 --> 03:32:04,950
Now, get back in front of the camera.

1652
03:32:05,510 --> 03:32:08,069
Try playing around with the cutout style.

1653
03:32:08,069 --> 03:32:09,110
Breeze always works the best.

1654
03:32:09,110 --> 03:32:10,149
Breeze always works the best.

1655
03:32:10,149 --> 03:32:13,030
Can you see yourself clearly in front of the background movie?

1656
03:32:14,389 --> 03:32:15,430
Two seems to work out.

1657
03:32:16,309 --> 03:32:18,479
I don't like the haze from Four.

1658
03:32:18,479 --> 03:32:19,600
Your core gets everything.

1659
03:32:21,040 --> 03:32:22,000
I'll just bring it in.

1660
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:23,780
Breeze, all right.

1661
03:32:23,780 --> 03:32:30,930
The problem is like the sun is starting to set.

1662
03:32:31,889 --> 03:32:34,610
It's a chip.

1663
03:32:35,729 --> 03:32:39,959
Welcome to the Cutout Studio.

1664
03:32:39,959 --> 03:32:43,079
This is where we separate your image from the background.

1665
03:32:43,639 --> 03:32:47,479
Select Start Cutout Studio to continue.

1666
03:32:47,479 --> 03:32:48,040
Do it again.

1667
03:32:51,329 --> 03:32:54,610
Please move out of the picture while we scan the background.

1668
03:32:56,120 --> 03:32:57,319
Please, hold on.

1669
03:32:58,840 --> 03:33:03,090
Cutout, now get back in front of the camera.

1670
03:33:03,090 --> 03:33:06,770
Try playing around with the cutout style to see the better.

1671
03:33:07,489 --> 03:33:08,610
It's better, all right.

1672
03:33:08,610 --> 03:33:09,110
Oh.

1673
03:33:10,290 --> 03:33:11,809
Choose the correct number.

1674
03:33:14,370 --> 03:33:26,719
Step into one of the four outlines for your picture.

1675
03:33:27,360 --> 03:33:30,239
This will decide which role you play in the movie.

1676
03:33:42,309 --> 03:33:43,030
To the set.

1677
03:33:43,829 --> 03:33:45,030
Hey, it's five o'clock Pacific.

1678
03:33:45,030 --> 03:33:46,790
That means it's like 10 o'clock where you are.

1679
03:33:48,069 --> 03:33:48,940
What time is it?

1680
03:33:49,819 --> 03:33:56,010
Howdy, Sheriff.

1681
03:33:56,010 --> 03:33:57,129
This is a holdup.

1682
03:33:57,690 --> 03:34:00,889
Dodge the junk and punch the desperadoes.

1683
03:34:00,889 --> 03:34:02,889
But these never show up anywhere.

1684
03:34:03,690 --> 03:34:05,049
These never show up anywhere.

1685
03:34:05,049 --> 03:34:06,569
The punches don't do anything.

1686
03:34:06,569 --> 03:34:07,069
Action.

1687
03:34:08,569 --> 03:34:10,229
That showed him, Sheriff.

1688
03:34:11,350 --> 03:34:12,950
Come back and see me sometime.

1689
03:34:16,329 --> 03:34:18,569
Oh, I'm supposed to grab that.

1690
03:34:18,569 --> 03:34:20,010
Ah, my arm.

1691
03:34:20,010 --> 03:34:21,930
My fucking broke my fucking wrist.

1692
03:34:23,770 --> 03:34:25,049
You want to try dodging?

1693
03:34:26,090 --> 03:34:28,329
What did she ever do to you, bully?

1694
03:34:29,129 --> 03:34:34,620
That was a close one.

1695
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:37,260
This is our showdown.

1696
03:34:37,260 --> 03:34:37,760
Nope.

1697
03:34:40,440 --> 03:34:42,040
One for the county jail.

1698
03:34:43,399 --> 03:34:45,239
Don't hit the dames.

1699
03:34:47,479 --> 03:34:48,120
Fuck at it.

1700
03:34:54,940 --> 03:34:57,420
Players two and three.

1701
03:34:57,420 --> 03:34:59,260
Oh shit, I forgot about costumes.

1702
03:35:00,139 --> 03:35:04,379
Two and three?

1703
03:35:05,180 --> 03:35:07,020
These were all fucked up.

1704
03:35:07,899 --> 03:35:08,459
It doesn't matter.

1705
03:35:08,459 --> 03:35:09,100
It's a holdup thing.

1706
03:35:09,100 --> 03:35:10,139
Tend like your treasure hunters.

1707
03:35:10,940 --> 03:35:13,659
Pull on the rope to lift the treasure from the deep.

1708
03:35:13,659 --> 03:35:15,739
Whoever does it fastest wins.

1709
03:35:17,020 --> 03:35:20,360
Action.

1710
03:35:20,360 --> 03:35:32,110
Booty.

1711
03:35:37,159 --> 03:35:43,819
I gotta get in this.

1712
03:35:47,850 --> 03:35:50,329
Player four, get yourself to the set.

1713
03:35:50,889 --> 03:35:51,389
Not good.

1714
03:35:52,250 --> 03:35:52,889
This is a mess.

1715
03:35:56,149 --> 03:35:56,870
This is a mess.

1716
03:35:57,430 --> 03:35:58,229
Play the instruments.

1717
03:35:59,750 --> 03:36:02,149
Imagine the biggest noise you can.

1718
03:36:02,709 --> 03:36:05,110
Play the instruments to make a racket.

1719
03:36:05,110 --> 03:36:07,510
The faster you go, the more you score.

1720
03:36:08,870 --> 03:36:12,579
Action.

1721
03:36:12,579 --> 03:36:13,700
Crash that cymbal.

1722
03:36:16,250 --> 03:36:17,209
There's a gong.

1723
03:36:23,260 --> 03:36:24,299
Shake that maraca.

1724
03:36:30,059 --> 03:36:31,100
Bang the congas.

1725
03:36:38,409 --> 03:36:39,450
Hit the tambourine.

1726
03:36:43,739 --> 03:36:45,500
Poke the child.

1727
03:36:54,100 --> 03:36:56,180
That was great.

1728
03:36:56,180 --> 03:36:57,860
You sure can make a racket.

1729
03:36:58,739 --> 03:37:05,370
Player one, I need you on set, please.

1730
03:37:13,030 --> 03:37:15,430
It's time for your starring moment.

1731
03:37:15,430 --> 03:37:16,790
There's no scoring.

1732
03:37:16,790 --> 03:37:19,350
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

1733
03:37:19,989 --> 03:37:20,790
Vampires, right?

1734
03:37:22,950 --> 03:37:24,790
Imagine you're looking down a well.

1735
03:37:27,940 --> 03:37:28,440
Action.

1736
03:37:31,620 --> 03:37:36,010
More feeling into it.

1737
03:37:36,010 --> 03:37:36,889
Stay on set.

1738
03:37:39,540 --> 03:37:40,340
Surprise.

1739
03:37:45,510 --> 03:37:46,950
And action.

1740
03:37:49,239 --> 03:37:50,280
Keep rolling, baby.

1741
03:37:51,000 --> 03:37:51,719
That wasn't surprised.

1742
03:37:51,719 --> 03:37:52,360
That was just weird.

1743
03:37:54,260 --> 03:37:55,459
They loved you, baby.

1744
03:37:59,079 --> 03:37:59,799
Player two.

1745
03:37:59,799 --> 03:38:00,920
I'm doing a vampire.

1746
03:38:10,870 --> 03:38:13,270
It's time for your starring moment.

1747
03:38:13,270 --> 03:38:18,379
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

1748
03:38:18,379 --> 03:38:20,860
Act like you're a nervous wreck.

1749
03:38:21,500 --> 03:38:25,120
Action.

1750
03:38:26,940 --> 03:38:28,299
Don't stop now.

1751
03:38:29,739 --> 03:38:30,950
Great.

1752
03:38:30,950 --> 03:38:31,510
Stay there.

1753
03:38:33,059 --> 03:38:34,260
Walk on the spot.

1754
03:38:40,090 --> 03:38:40,590
Action.

1755
03:38:42,920 --> 03:38:43,479
Keep it up.

1756
03:38:45,350 --> 03:38:46,729
And another.

1757
03:38:48,170 --> 03:38:48,809
Another one?

1758
03:38:48,889 --> 03:38:50,649
Go crazy with panic.

1759
03:38:50,649 --> 03:38:52,010
Go crazy with panic.

1760
03:38:52,809 --> 03:38:55,719
Action.

1761
03:38:57,670 --> 03:38:58,170
Come on.

1762
03:38:58,549 --> 03:38:59,430
Show me what you got.

1763
03:39:00,950 --> 03:39:02,389
That was just like...

1764
03:39:02,389 --> 03:39:03,190
I don't know what that was.

1765
03:39:04,709 --> 03:39:05,510
That was just like the...

1766
03:39:07,879 --> 03:39:08,920
Oh my god.

1767
03:39:08,920 --> 03:39:09,639
Player three.

1768
03:39:09,639 --> 03:39:10,600
You need it on set.

1769
03:39:11,239 --> 03:39:12,840
That was fucking terrible.

1770
03:39:12,840 --> 03:39:13,319
Ow!

1771
03:39:13,319 --> 03:39:13,819
My arm.

1772
03:39:17,940 --> 03:39:19,379
And now it's your time to shine.

1773
03:39:19,379 --> 03:39:21,139
That was like I've been into a fucking pizza that was too long.

1774
03:39:21,139 --> 03:39:22,899
Just follow my instructions and act like a star.

1775
03:39:22,899 --> 03:39:25,059
That was over acting for my friends.

1776
03:39:25,860 --> 03:39:27,379
Act like a ghost.

1777
03:39:27,379 --> 03:39:27,879
A ghost.

1778
03:39:28,659 --> 03:39:33,309
Action.

1779
03:39:38,969 --> 03:39:39,690
Keep it up.

1780
03:39:40,250 --> 03:39:42,010
Stay on set.

1781
03:39:44,899 --> 03:39:46,579
Lift your hands and scream.

1782
03:39:46,579 --> 03:39:47,299
Boo.

1783
03:39:47,299 --> 03:39:51,370
Action.

1784
03:39:54,700 --> 03:40:01,860
Poor feeling into it.

1785
03:40:01,860 --> 03:40:02,819
Hear that applause?

1786
03:40:03,620 --> 03:40:04,739
What a moment.

1787
03:40:19,290 --> 03:40:21,290
Players two and four.

1788
03:40:21,290 --> 03:40:22,969
On set now please.

1789
03:40:22,969 --> 03:40:24,250
I can't get out of character.

1790
03:40:24,809 --> 03:40:25,770
I'm stuck in this one.

1791
03:40:31,829 --> 03:40:33,829
Let's all do the conga.

1792
03:40:33,829 --> 03:40:37,750
Hit the drums as fast as you can to make your monkey dance faster.

1793
03:40:39,000 --> 03:40:40,040
I did this already.

1794
03:40:40,040 --> 03:40:40,760
I did this jump.

1795
03:40:45,690 --> 03:40:47,049
Action.

1796
03:40:48,250 --> 03:40:50,459
Ow.

1797
03:40:54,579 --> 03:40:55,079
Ow.

1798
03:41:00,540 --> 03:41:01,040
Ow.

1799
03:41:02,139 --> 03:41:15,079
On the set please.

1800
03:41:19,139 --> 03:41:19,780
That's great.

1801
03:41:21,139 --> 03:41:22,579
Knock on the door, dodge the junk.

1802
03:41:24,389 --> 03:41:27,110
Imagine you're waking up the sheriff.

1803
03:41:27,110 --> 03:41:30,069
Knock on the door, but be ready to dodge the junk.

1804
03:41:30,069 --> 03:41:31,110
And catch the gold.

1805
03:41:31,989 --> 03:41:40,090
Action.

1806
03:41:45,770 --> 03:41:59,020
I'm going to tuck these in.

1807
03:41:59,739 --> 03:42:00,239
Hold on.

1808
03:42:01,719 --> 03:42:03,959
I'm going to like Steve Urkel this shit for the next one.

1809
03:42:06,409 --> 03:42:06,909
Ouch.

1810
03:42:07,290 --> 03:42:08,809
Gotta move quicker next time.

1811
03:42:09,530 --> 03:42:16,459
Already?

1812
03:42:16,459 --> 03:42:22,549
Player three, get yourself to the set.

1813
03:42:22,549 --> 03:42:30,840
I should have done this for this character in the first one.

1814
03:42:30,840 --> 03:42:32,280
Now you must have seen this before.

1815
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:34,440
Watch the cups carefully.

1816
03:42:34,440 --> 03:42:37,399
Then point at the cup that you think contains the pea.

1817
03:42:38,440 --> 03:42:42,979
Action.

1818
03:42:43,059 --> 03:42:45,190
Round and round they go.

1819
03:42:48,149 --> 03:42:48,649
Okay.

1820
03:42:49,430 --> 03:42:50,229
Which cup?

1821
03:42:51,530 --> 03:42:52,409
You found it.

1822
03:42:53,049 --> 03:42:55,129
There's no pulling the wool over your eyes.

1823
03:42:57,209 --> 03:42:59,500
This is a fucking great old man.

1824
03:43:00,780 --> 03:43:03,079
Round and round they go.

1825
03:43:04,840 --> 03:43:08,120
This is the guy at the poker table from like fucking three weekends ago.

1826
03:43:08,120 --> 03:43:08,920
Which cup?

1827
03:43:09,639 --> 03:43:15,610
Who took your eye off the cup?

1828
03:43:15,610 --> 03:43:16,489
I do like this though.

1829
03:43:16,489 --> 03:43:17,930
I do actually really like this one.

1830
03:43:18,729 --> 03:43:19,770
I got point eight seconds.

1831
03:43:20,250 --> 03:43:21,450
Round and round they go.

1832
03:43:25,700 --> 03:43:26,200
Okay.

1833
03:43:26,979 --> 03:43:27,780
Which cup?

1834
03:43:28,340 --> 03:43:31,829
You've got your wits about you.

1835
03:43:33,430 --> 03:43:34,790
I'm afraid to pull these all the way up

1836
03:43:34,790 --> 03:43:38,069
because I feel like you'll be able to see my like fucking thighs.

1837
03:43:40,229 --> 03:43:43,270
Player four, I need you on set please.

1838
03:43:43,270 --> 03:43:44,389
Let's do our own movie.

1839
03:43:45,510 --> 03:43:47,430
Look at all that stuff you got there.

1840
03:43:47,430 --> 03:43:48,229
Look at all those.

1841
03:43:48,950 --> 03:43:49,670
What's that?

1842
03:43:49,670 --> 03:43:50,709
Cranberry?

1843
03:43:50,709 --> 03:43:52,790
It's time for your starring moment.

1844
03:43:53,270 --> 03:43:54,469
There's no scoring.

1845
03:43:54,469 --> 03:43:57,030
Follow my instruction and act your heart out.

1846
03:44:01,639 --> 03:44:03,530
Look the floor.

1847
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:04,809
Act like a zombie.

1848
03:44:05,770 --> 03:44:06,270
Action.

1849
03:44:08,520 --> 03:44:09,020
That's it.

1850
03:44:15,260 --> 03:44:17,579
Lift your hands and scream boo.

1851
03:44:17,579 --> 03:44:21,389
Action.

1852
03:44:24,250 --> 03:44:25,049
Keep it going.

1853
03:44:25,049 --> 03:44:28,030
Wait.

1854
03:44:30,440 --> 03:44:32,440
Pretend you're a vampire.

1855
03:44:33,159 --> 03:44:36,909
Action.

1856
03:44:38,579 --> 03:44:39,620
That's it.

1857
03:44:39,620 --> 03:44:40,420
Keep it going.

1858
03:44:44,579 --> 03:44:45,860
You brought the house down.

1859
03:44:46,579 --> 03:44:48,100
I was kind of trying to break out.

1860
03:44:48,979 --> 03:44:50,979
Like I'm in the thing's stomach and ripping the fuck up.

1861
03:44:54,389 --> 03:44:55,750
Why am I destroying this fat suit?

1862
03:44:55,750 --> 03:44:57,989
Do you think I'm ever going to use this again for any reason?

1863
03:44:57,989 --> 03:45:00,309
And now it's your time to shine.

1864
03:45:00,950 --> 03:45:03,750
Just follow my instructions and act like a star.

1865
03:45:04,309 --> 03:45:07,750
Oh inside of Humpty Dumpty was another Humpty Dumpty.

1866
03:45:07,750 --> 03:45:08,250
Who is this?

1867
03:45:08,250 --> 03:45:10,069
Put your hands together in glee.

1868
03:45:11,190 --> 03:45:11,670
Who is it?

1869
03:45:11,670 --> 03:45:12,469
Who is it?

1870
03:45:12,469 --> 03:45:13,909
And action.

1871
03:45:19,030 --> 03:45:20,389
Let's try one more.

1872
03:45:23,610 --> 03:45:25,209
Wake up and scream.

1873
03:45:26,090 --> 03:45:29,129
Action.

1874
03:45:32,620 --> 03:45:37,700
They loved you baby.

1875
03:45:41,879 --> 03:45:49,690
Has he gone insane?

1876
03:45:51,370 --> 03:45:52,489
How about a good time playing?

1877
03:45:55,129 --> 03:45:56,760
Play one, right?

1878
03:45:56,760 --> 03:46:00,170
This hurts.

1879
03:46:04,780 --> 03:46:06,219
It's a tornado.

1880
03:46:06,219 --> 03:46:08,139
Run as fast as you can to get away.

1881
03:46:20,840 --> 03:46:21,959
It's gaining on you.

1882
03:46:22,600 --> 03:46:23,479
Oh my god.

1883
03:46:23,479 --> 03:46:25,479
Quite a bad wind but this is...

1884
03:46:25,479 --> 03:46:26,920
This is fucking real.

1885
03:46:26,920 --> 03:46:28,360

1886
03:46:29,239 --> 03:46:46,889

What a soul.

1893
03:47:24,149 --> 03:47:29,219
Get into the groove.

1894
03:47:29,219 --> 03:47:30,979
You are the greatest dancer.

1895
03:47:30,979 --> 03:47:37,319
Let your feet do the talking.

1896
03:47:40,340 --> 03:47:41,700
Dance to the music.

1897
03:47:42,739 --> 03:47:43,700
That was some performance.

1898
03:47:43,700 --> 03:47:44,579
Stop this.

1899
03:47:44,579 --> 03:47:45,299
God damn it.

1900
03:47:45,299 --> 03:47:47,639
Greatest with a capital grooving.

1901
03:47:47,639 --> 03:47:54,940
Player one, get your butt on the set.

1902

I know.

1903
03:47:55,500 --> 03:47:56,780
I said that earlier in the stream.

1904
03:47:56,780 --> 03:47:58,299
All this shit is fucking on camera, bro.

1905
03:47:59,100 --> 03:48:04,340
What am I gonna do?

1906
03:48:04,340 --> 03:48:05,319
Delate the vlog?

1907
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:07,879
You are a treasure hunter.

1908
03:48:07,879 --> 03:48:11,319
Pull on the rope before the time runs out to get the treasure.

1909
03:48:11,319 --> 03:48:12,120

You didn't get the treasure.

1913
03:48:34,299 --> 03:48:35,420
Time to walk the plank.

1914
03:48:36,299 --> 03:48:38,059
Maybe the crazy frog kid.

1915
03:48:38,059 --> 03:48:41,100

At least 10 of you will know what the fuck I'm talking about.

1922
03:48:50,860 --> 03:48:55,510
It's halfway through the crazy frog video.

1923
03:48:55,510 --> 03:48:56,709
The enemy is about to attack.

1924
03:48:56,709 --> 03:48:57,510
He does this.

1925
03:48:57,510 --> 03:49:00,469
Wave your arms to clear the smoke so you can see them coming.

And then after that the bits will be probably half an hour

2548
05:08:33,639 --> 05:08:35,639

I I have it restart the console. Yeah, i'll do that too

2816
05:35:40,479 --> 05:35:42,479
I'm gonna red ring this xbox

2817
05:35:42,720 --> 05:35:47,450
Did I get twister? Yes, I did

2818
05:35:59,659 --> 05:36:01,659
No connect games are worth playing

2819
05:36:03,000 --> 05:36:07,529
That's true. Well, some of them are

2820
05:36:09,840 --> 05:36:11,919
I think there's at least a handful that might be worth playing

2821
05:36:12,479 --> 05:36:23,229
Star wars connect dancing

2822
05:36:23,869 --> 05:36:29,369
I don't think I have that one

2823
05:36:29,430 --> 05:36:31,689
Connectable connectimals. Yes, I have that too

2824
05:36:32,409 --> 05:36:47,529
That's the only good one

2825
05:36:47,529 --> 05:36:52,169
So we will go through i'm gonna assume that I wanted a whole stream for this game because obviously

2826
05:36:52,729 --> 05:36:54,729
I felt like there was a lot to explore when there was

2827
05:36:58,540 --> 05:37:00,700
I do have rise of nightmares. I also have hunt

2828
05:37:13,159 --> 05:37:14,439
Yeah, I got them all

2829
05:37:14,439 --> 05:37:24,430
All right, let's take let's i'm gonna restart the 360

2830
05:37:25,900 --> 05:37:28,619
Should have about 11 or 12 to watch start to finish

2831
05:37:37,659 --> 05:37:41,080
Here we go

2832
05:37:41,080 --> 05:37:43,869
Oh

2833
05:37:43,869 --> 05:37:45,150
I am

2834
05:37:45,150 --> 05:37:47,840
Tired

2835
05:37:47,840 --> 05:37:49,840
I didn't think this game was going to take it out of me that much

2836
05:37:50,319 --> 05:37:56,240
But it did I think it was the changing clothes like every 15 seconds ladies and gentlemen

2837
05:37:57,040 --> 05:38:00,000
Welcome to the you're in the movies awards

2838
05:38:04,090 --> 05:38:07,529
And now the moment you've all been waiting for

2839
05:38:08,569 --> 05:38:11,369
The nominees for best actor are

2840
05:38:13,799 --> 05:38:18,349
Nominee one

2841
05:38:18,430 --> 05:38:22,509
Nominee two arm base arm and arm

2842
05:38:22,990 --> 05:38:24,990
Nominee three

2843
05:38:25,069 --> 05:38:27,069
Is the constant standing?

2844
05:38:27,389 --> 05:38:30,270
No, I think it was not many four. There's probably a combination of everything

2845
05:38:31,639 --> 05:38:35,319
But of course there can only be one winner

2846
05:38:36,779 --> 05:38:41,500
And the you're in the movies award for best actor goes to

2847
05:38:49,520 --> 05:38:52,880
Please take to the podium to accept this prestigious award

2848
05:38:53,360 --> 05:38:55,360
Perhaps you'd like to say a few words

2849
05:39:10,090 --> 05:39:15,049
I'm so tired. I am trashed right now. Not even alcohol. I'm just saying

2850
05:39:17,200 --> 05:39:25,689
Oh, how many different do you think? I feel like I want to do these

2851
05:39:26,490 --> 05:39:29,529
That's some of the point. There's like six or seven more that I think I'm gonna do

2852
05:39:32,009 --> 05:39:42,700
Steal the day some of these look funny, but uh, let's go to

2853
05:39:44,060 --> 05:39:47,720
movie theater

2854
05:39:47,720 --> 05:39:51,360
Watch a movie. I'm gonna restart the

2855
05:39:52,919 --> 05:39:55,049
console

2856
05:39:55,049 --> 05:39:57,049
This thing is on fire

2857
05:39:59,759 --> 05:40:01,419
Wow

2858
05:40:01,419 --> 05:40:03,419
This thing is burning up

2859
05:40:05,799 --> 05:40:07,880
Whoa easy, what the fuck are you doing?

2860
05:40:11,529 --> 05:40:19,759
It just spit the disc at me. I didn't do anything. I would say this is probably like 250 degrees

2861
05:40:20,319 --> 05:40:22,970
If I were to take a guess

2862
05:40:22,970 --> 05:40:27,290
Inside of here if I touched inside of here, I would burn my hand out to go to the hospital if I put my finger

2863
05:40:27,369 --> 05:40:31,639
Inside of this unit

2864
05:40:31,639 --> 05:40:38,750
Okay restarting

2865
05:40:38,750 --> 05:40:43,400
And here we go. I wonder what the bottom of this feels like

2866
05:40:49,709 --> 05:40:52,060
xbox sucks

2867
05:40:52,060 --> 05:40:57,580
Yeah, and so earlier today it was it was over probably 100 105 here in vegas. So

2868
05:40:58,220 --> 05:41:03,000
Probably not the best environment for an old 360, but this is one of the newer models. This is one of the slim ones

2869
05:41:07,439 --> 05:41:08,799
They can handle it, right?

2870
05:41:08,799 --> 05:41:30,860
Okay, here we go

2871
05:41:30,860 --> 05:41:35,000
All right, the slim models had overheating problems

2872
05:41:35,799 --> 05:41:38,599
Uh-oh

2873
05:41:38,599 --> 05:41:50,680
How bad come to you're in the movies the game that makes you

2874
05:41:51,080 --> 05:41:53,080
All right, we're gonna watch him start to finish

2875
05:41:53,720 --> 05:42:04,279
All right, we're gonna do who this is who cares

2876
05:42:05,080 --> 05:42:08,040
No, no, no, no, no, I might be in I'm no we're gonna do who cares too

2877
05:42:09,360 --> 05:42:14,840
You ready?

2878
05:42:14,840 --> 05:42:19,659
Who cares?

2879
05:42:19,659 --> 05:42:21,659
Everyone's super

2880
05:42:25,639 --> 05:42:27,639
every superhero super

2881
05:42:29,419 --> 05:42:32,459
But some are more super than others

2882
05:42:40,189 --> 05:42:42,189
And where there are heroes

2883
05:42:43,549 --> 05:42:48,250
There are villains

2884
05:42:48,250 --> 05:42:51,130
battles adventure

2885
05:42:51,909 --> 05:42:53,909
Breathtaking effects

2886
05:42:56,009 --> 05:42:58,490
Not a silly costume in sight

2887
05:42:59,529 --> 05:43:02,810
Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers?

2888
05:43:04,279 --> 05:43:07,099
rippling muscles

2889
05:43:07,639 --> 05:43:09,880
Astounding abilities

2890
05:43:09,979 --> 05:43:11,979
fiercer than a ranting mom

2891
05:43:13,450 --> 05:43:15,930
More courageous than a hungry mouse

2892
05:43:18,619 --> 05:43:20,939
Faster than waiting for a bus

2893
05:43:24,569 --> 05:43:27,369
So when you're feeling low remember

2894
05:43:28,330 --> 05:43:35,150
Everyone's super

2895
05:43:35,150 --> 05:43:37,709
Well, that was the first one and it was dog shit

2896
05:43:38,729 --> 05:43:44,919
Here's who cares three. I don't remember which one this one was

2897
05:43:48,830 --> 05:43:50,909
It was a day like any other day

2898
05:43:53,560 --> 05:43:55,560
until a terrible accident

2899
05:43:56,279 --> 05:43:58,840
Created a horrifying atomic monster

2900
05:44:00,900 --> 05:44:05,830
cold-blooded

2901
05:44:05,930 --> 05:44:10,409
Watch in terror as the radioactive mastodon wreaks havoc

2902
05:44:12,830 --> 05:44:14,830
Trying to dodge the laser

2903
05:44:16,009 --> 05:44:18,009
Created by nature

2904
05:44:18,069 --> 05:44:20,069
twisted by science

2905
05:44:21,369 --> 05:44:24,490
No weapons of warfare known to man can harm it

2906
05:44:29,099 --> 05:44:31,659
Can anything stop this leviathan?

2907
05:44:34,349 --> 05:44:36,349
Can mankind use science?

2908
05:44:37,069 --> 05:44:39,150
to fight nature with nature

2909
05:44:40,700 --> 05:44:42,700
Feel your blood run cold

2910
05:44:46,889 --> 05:44:48,889
cold-blooded

2911
05:44:51,159 --> 05:44:53,159
Okay, that one actually sucked

2912
05:44:56,360 --> 05:44:58,360
That was just stupid

2913
05:44:59,560 --> 05:45:02,599
The lizard was the best character in that whole trailer. It wasn't me

2914
05:45:07,819 --> 05:45:12,830
Here's me me and me

2915
05:45:12,830 --> 05:45:13,709
me

2916
05:45:13,709 --> 05:45:15,709
Me and me

2917
05:45:17,279 --> 05:45:19,599
Today is a day you'll never forget

2918
05:45:25,369 --> 05:45:27,290
somewhere

2919
05:45:27,290 --> 05:45:29,290
at some point in time

2920
05:45:29,979 --> 05:45:31,979
in a secret location

2921
05:45:33,529 --> 05:45:35,529
the boundaries of science

2922
05:45:35,930 --> 05:45:37,930
of being stretched

2923
05:45:37,990 --> 05:45:39,990
beyond breaking point

2924
05:45:42,169 --> 05:45:44,169
Through the miracle of science

2925
05:45:46,090 --> 05:45:48,090
You could find yourself

2926
05:45:48,970 --> 05:45:50,970
Becoming more

2927
05:45:54,110 --> 05:45:56,970
Much more

2928
05:45:56,970 --> 05:45:58,970
loads more

2929
05:45:59,290 --> 05:46:02,299
And then some

2930
05:46:02,299 --> 05:46:04,299
So when you're in a pickle

2931
05:46:04,939 --> 05:46:07,099
There's only one person you can count on

2932
05:46:08,220 --> 05:46:09,180
you

2933
05:46:09,180 --> 05:46:10,700
and you

2934
05:46:10,700 --> 05:46:14,860
and you

2935
05:46:14,939 --> 05:46:18,540
The thing the algorithm making everybody fat is just fucking too funny

2936
05:46:20,479 --> 05:46:22,159
Oh, man

2937
05:46:26,889 --> 05:46:28,889
Here comes the murder mansion

2938
05:46:32,169 --> 05:46:34,169
dial m for a menu

2939
05:46:35,400 --> 05:46:37,639
Today's meal is murder

2940
05:46:42,250 --> 05:46:44,250
There's plenty to eat

2941
05:46:44,330 --> 05:46:46,330
When murders on the menu

2942
05:46:48,189 --> 05:46:50,189
Murder at the mansion

2943
05:46:50,830 --> 05:46:52,830
Everyone has a motive

2944
05:46:59,819 --> 05:47:01,819
Everyone has a secret

2945
05:47:04,479 --> 05:47:06,479
Everyone is a suspect

2946
05:47:13,419 --> 05:47:15,419
Who has the last laugh

2947
05:47:16,060 --> 05:47:18,299
When a joke goes too far

2948
05:47:24,220 --> 05:47:26,220
But who is to blame?

2949
05:47:26,880 --> 05:47:28,880
Who is guilty of?

2950
05:47:29,279 --> 05:47:31,279
Murder at the mansion

2951
05:47:38,560 --> 05:47:42,650
No, I would not like to see it again

2952
05:47:42,810 --> 05:47:47,529
This one I think is my favorite. I think love story is my favorite. There's so much going on in this one

2953
05:47:49,279 --> 05:47:54,319
I love all of them equally but I think this one might be the best one just because it's a fucking all over the place

2954
05:47:59,790 --> 05:48:01,790
Looking for love

2955
05:48:01,869 --> 05:48:04,680
Is a tricky business

2956
05:48:04,680 --> 05:48:06,779
Having a best friend

2957
05:48:06,779 --> 05:48:16,639
Can make it harder and

2958
05:48:17,740 --> 05:48:19,439
Excitement

2959
05:48:19,439 --> 05:48:21,279
And security

2960
05:48:21,279 --> 05:48:23,279
Is what we're all looking for

2961
05:48:30,400 --> 05:48:33,930
And if it doesn't work out we try again

2962
05:48:37,200 --> 05:48:39,360
And again

2963
05:48:39,360 --> 05:48:50,919
But sometimes

2964
05:48:50,919 --> 05:48:52,919
The right one for you

2965
05:48:53,080 --> 05:48:55,080
Is closer than you think

2966
05:48:57,759 --> 05:48:59,759
Watch close to your heart

2967
05:48:59,840 --> 05:49:02,319
Because love is never far away

2968
05:49:06,590 --> 05:49:08,590
That's my favorite I love that one

2969
05:49:10,060 --> 05:49:15,340
Uh, I just the best part is the the picture the naked fat guy, right? That's your picture

2970
05:49:16,220 --> 05:49:20,400
That's what you have for a photo and then you show up naked too

2971
05:49:21,040 --> 05:49:28,090
At the front door and it's like that. Oh my god. Wow, you're so so dashing

2972
05:49:28,970 --> 05:49:36,240
This is the private eye one. I think this one was pretty good, too

2973
05:49:41,639 --> 05:49:46,860
private eye

2974
05:49:46,939 --> 05:49:48,939
It was a quiet day for crime

2975
05:49:50,729 --> 05:49:53,130
Then bad news walked in layers

2976
05:49:53,770 --> 05:49:57,709
to that

2977
05:49:57,709 --> 05:49:59,709
Everyone wants to play the field

2978
05:50:03,659 --> 05:50:05,979
And no one wants to get caught

2979
05:50:08,080 --> 05:50:10,560
Love can make us do terrible things

2980
05:50:11,659 --> 05:50:13,659
diabolical dancing

2981
05:50:15,180 --> 05:50:17,180
Sensational scandal

2982
05:50:18,240 --> 05:50:20,479
Most people want one of two things

2983
05:50:21,119 --> 05:50:22,080
love

2984
05:50:22,080 --> 05:50:27,150
or money

2985
05:50:27,150 --> 05:50:28,189
some

2986
05:50:28,189 --> 05:50:30,029
want both

2987
05:50:31,549 --> 05:50:33,630
Before you act on your suspicions

2988
05:50:34,750 --> 05:50:36,750
Get yourself some proof

2989
05:50:36,990 --> 05:50:38,669
Get yourself

2990
05:50:38,669 --> 05:50:40,669
a private eye

2991
05:50:46,479 --> 05:50:49,520
Okay, so the first my favorite part is the first scene

2992
05:50:51,360 --> 05:50:54,240
The private eye is sitting there and the door open he's crying

2993
05:50:54,959 --> 05:50:58,159
Before somebody like a customer comes in and he has to shape up real quick

2994
05:51:00,919 --> 05:51:03,159
Normal I can see that again

2995
05:51:03,400 --> 05:51:08,650
Private eye

2996
05:51:08,650 --> 05:51:10,650
It was a quiet day for crime

2997
05:51:12,459 --> 05:51:14,459
Then bad news walked in

2998
05:51:19,400 --> 05:51:21,400
Everyone wants to play the field

2999
05:51:22,279 --> 05:51:24,279
Is that person crying?

3000
05:51:25,400 --> 05:51:27,639
And no one wants to get caught

3001
05:51:29,790 --> 05:51:32,270
Love can make us do terrible things

3002
05:51:34,009 --> 05:51:36,009
Diabolical dancing

3003
05:51:36,970 --> 05:51:38,970
Sensational scandal

3004
05:51:39,939 --> 05:51:44,500
Most people want one of two things love or money

3005
05:51:48,819 --> 05:51:50,819
Some want both

3006
05:51:53,220 --> 05:51:55,220
Before you act on your suspicions

3007
05:51:56,419 --> 05:51:58,419
Get yourself some proof

3008
05:51:58,659 --> 05:52:00,340
Get yourself

3009
05:52:00,340 --> 05:52:02,340
a private eye

3010
05:52:03,939 --> 05:52:09,700
I mean, that's kind of bad like back to back. These are like just

3011
05:52:10,419 --> 05:52:13,240
I think I can't pick one. I can't pick which one's better

3012
05:52:14,419 --> 05:52:16,419
I think it's probably love story though

3013
05:52:17,299 --> 05:52:20,259
Let me see it again. Let me see it one more time and then we'll move on

3014
05:52:22,659 --> 05:52:28,700
Looking for love is a tricky business having a best friend

3015
05:52:29,659 --> 05:52:35,419
Can make it harder

3016
05:52:35,740 --> 05:52:40,409
a little romance

3017
05:52:40,709 --> 05:52:42,330
Excitement

3018
05:52:42,330 --> 05:52:44,169
and security

3019
05:52:44,169 --> 05:52:46,169
Is what we're all looking for

3020
05:52:46,490 --> 05:52:56,860
And if it doesn't work out we try again

3021
05:52:58,220 --> 05:53:12,279
and again

3022
05:53:12,279 --> 05:53:14,919
But sometimes the right one for you

3023
05:53:16,040 --> 05:53:20,580
Is closer than you think

3024
05:53:20,659 --> 05:53:22,659
Watch close to your heart

3025
05:53:22,819 --> 05:53:25,220
Because love is never far away

3026
05:53:26,099 --> 05:53:29,700
It's like a computer put it together. It's not even it's it's like just

3027
05:53:30,819 --> 05:53:32,819
Stock put it in a computer

3028
05:53:40,279 --> 05:53:47,080
God a computer did put it together. Yeah, that's true

3029
05:53:47,479 --> 05:53:53,000
But this this is the dinosaur one these these next three are fucking horrible, but we're gonna watch them. Anyways

3030
05:53:55,220 --> 05:53:57,220
It's yeah, it's like talk to transformer

3031
05:53:59,560 --> 05:54:02,200
It started with a meeting of great minds

3032
05:54:07,500 --> 05:54:10,060
And a plan to travel to a lost world

3033
05:54:13,770 --> 05:54:18,009
Journey to a land never be held by man woman nor child

3034
05:54:20,779 --> 05:54:24,939
Discover sights and sounds no human has ever seen before

3035
05:54:25,939 --> 05:54:27,939
Prehistoric paradise

3036
05:54:32,229 --> 05:54:34,869
Marvel at the mammoth monstrosities

3037
05:54:36,869 --> 05:54:38,869
Groundbreaking discoveries

3038
05:54:39,830 --> 05:54:41,830
Enormous eggs

3039
05:54:47,860 --> 05:54:49,860
Terrifying monsters

3040
05:54:50,840 --> 05:54:52,840
Older than your dreams

3041
05:54:53,159 --> 05:54:55,720
scarier than your nightmares a

3042
05:54:57,000 --> 05:54:59,000
Daring rescue mission

3043
05:54:59,319 --> 05:55:02,599
Be prepared to witness the spectacle that is

3044
05:55:03,540 --> 05:55:05,540
Prehistoric paradise

3045
05:55:06,680 --> 05:55:11,240
It's like your actor was so bad that they just got like drunk on set every day

3046
05:55:11,959 --> 05:55:13,959
And they didn't even do their lines

3047
05:55:14,119 --> 05:55:18,439
So you had to piece something together. What you you you already were halfway through making the whole movie

3048
05:55:25,360 --> 05:55:27,939
Vampire, I don't remember vampire. I don't even remember this one

3049
05:55:29,139 --> 05:55:34,819
Oh, yeah, the scooby doo who run this one is the most coherent. I think it was supposed to be

3050
05:55:35,700 --> 05:55:37,700
the trip of a lifetime

3051
05:55:39,110 --> 05:55:41,430
It turned into a holiday from hell

3052
05:55:45,639 --> 05:55:49,720
Gaze and horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night

3053
05:55:51,819 --> 05:55:53,740
This is the vacation

3054
05:55:53,740 --> 05:55:54,939
to end

3055
05:55:54,939 --> 05:55:56,939
all vacations

3056
05:55:57,430 --> 05:55:59,669
You won't be able

3057
05:55:59,990 --> 05:56:04,180
To leave will anyone hear you scream?

3058
05:56:05,299 --> 05:56:10,490
There's loads of excitement

3059
05:56:10,810 --> 05:56:13,799
But be sure

3060
05:56:13,799 --> 05:56:15,799
Not to lose your head

3061
05:56:15,959 --> 05:56:26,759
Your friends for dinner literally

3062
05:56:37,580 --> 05:56:38,779
So

3063
05:56:38,779 --> 05:56:41,819
If you feel the life being sucked out of you

3064
05:56:43,180 --> 05:56:45,180
It's time for a vampiric

3065
05:56:45,799 --> 05:56:47,799
vacation

3066
05:56:52,900 --> 05:56:57,220
I like I like this one, but I like one part there's only one part of like when they're at the dinner table

3067
05:56:58,180 --> 05:56:59,220
and

3068
05:56:59,220 --> 05:57:02,819
The robe robe guy has like a wine glass in his hand and he's just like

3069
05:57:04,000 --> 05:57:07,060
Overanimated and over enunciating that's what we'll see one more time

3070
05:57:08,569 --> 05:57:10,409
It was supposed to be

3071
05:57:10,490 --> 05:57:12,490
The trip of a lifetime

3072
05:57:13,819 --> 05:57:16,220
It turned into a holiday from hell

3073
05:57:18,740 --> 05:57:20,389
What's the dinner?

3074
05:57:20,389 --> 05:57:24,470
Gaze and horror upon the bizarre creatures of the night

3075
05:57:26,569 --> 05:57:28,490
This is the vacation

3076
05:57:28,490 --> 05:57:29,689
to end

3077
05:57:29,689 --> 05:57:31,689
all vacations

3078
05:57:32,169 --> 05:57:34,169
You won't be able to leave

3079
05:57:37,290 --> 05:57:39,290
Will anyone hear you scream?

3080
05:57:43,240 --> 05:57:45,240
There's loads of excitement

3081
05:57:46,229 --> 05:57:49,669
What a lovely game but be sure not to lose your head

3082
05:57:57,959 --> 05:58:09,479
Have your friends for dinner literally and that's what I tried to rip through it didn't work

3083
05:58:12,360 --> 05:58:13,479
So

3084
05:58:13,479 --> 05:58:16,520
If you feel the life being sucked out of you

3085
05:58:17,880 --> 05:58:19,880
It's time for a vampiric

3086
05:58:20,580 --> 05:58:22,580
vacation

3087
05:58:27,959 --> 05:58:32,380
All right, oh yeah, yeah, I

3088
05:58:34,090 --> 05:58:37,209
Uh witnesses, oh, this is the one with this one with shito

3089
05:58:38,090 --> 05:58:42,409
This oh, this one's the eating. This is the eating. Oh, I love this one. This one actually might be my favorite

3090
05:58:42,490 --> 05:58:45,450
It's it's tough because it's so fucking scared witness

3091
05:58:53,990 --> 05:58:56,229
There are no perfect crimes

3092
05:58:58,119 --> 05:59:00,119
And when you're the only witness

3093
05:59:01,560 --> 05:59:03,959
Danger lurks around every corner

3094
05:59:07,319 --> 05:59:12,439
It's a deadly game

3095
05:59:12,840 --> 05:59:21,930
When you for your life hiding a secret that nobody knows

3096
05:59:26,779 --> 05:59:29,509
chased

3097
05:59:29,509 --> 05:59:31,509
hunted

3098
05:59:33,009 --> 05:59:36,069
Excitement lies dead ahead

3099
05:59:38,650 --> 05:59:40,650
Jeopardy awaits

3100
05:59:41,610 --> 05:59:43,369
Impending peril

3101
05:59:43,369 --> 05:59:48,759
Would you go?

3102
05:59:48,759 --> 05:59:50,279
if you

3103
05:59:50,279 --> 05:59:52,279
Over there. Yes, you

3104
05:59:53,080 --> 05:59:55,080
Were scared witness

3105
06:00:03,430 --> 06:00:07,270
And then I did an even better one in this next one when I stuffed the whole thing in my mouth

3106
06:00:07,349 --> 06:00:09,509
And they didn't even use it. They didn't even use any of it

3107
06:00:11,060 --> 06:00:12,599
deity

3108
06:00:12,599 --> 06:00:14,599
Oh, right the book one

3109
06:00:21,580 --> 06:00:32,259
Deity for a day feeling washed up life got you beat

3110
06:00:37,500 --> 06:00:39,500
Seeing things again

3111
06:00:39,830 --> 06:00:41,830
Why not get away?

3112
06:00:42,069 --> 06:00:47,560
yourself

3113
06:00:47,560 --> 06:00:49,560
in paradise

3114
06:00:56,009 --> 06:01:00,169
Meet new friends

3115
06:01:00,169 --> 06:01:02,169

3122
06:01:46,900 --> 06:01:55,799
God

3123
06:02:04,520 --> 06:02:10,169
When did that even happen no one could have dreamt such an eerie event could occur

3124
06:02:13,619 --> 06:02:14,979
here

3125
06:02:14,979 --> 06:02:16,979
on our own planet earth

3126
06:02:17,700 --> 06:02:19,700
But they came

3127
06:02:20,340 --> 06:02:27,909
They fed

3128
06:02:27,909 --> 06:02:30,229
They spun their meticulous webs

3129
06:02:34,790 --> 06:02:36,790
Run for your lives

3130
06:02:39,029 --> 06:02:41,029
They're freakish

3131
06:02:44,869 --> 06:02:46,869
They're brutish

3132
06:02:48,020 --> 06:02:50,020
They're certainly her suit

3133
06:02:56,020 --> 06:02:59,299
They're spiders from space

3134
06:03:20,099 --> 06:03:23,560
Oh, who cares one

3135
06:03:27,979 --> 06:03:33,500
I think it's just it's just the superhero one, but I might be naked. Let me see

3136
06:03:47,020 --> 06:03:49,020
These superheroes super

3137
06:03:50,540 --> 06:03:53,580
But some are more naked good others

3138
06:04:01,159 --> 06:04:03,159
And where there are heroes

3139
06:04:04,419 --> 06:04:07,380
There are villains. I don't think i'm gonna end this for more than a second

3140
06:04:09,159 --> 06:04:11,479
That I I tested it. I think i'm going to eventually

3141
06:04:12,900 --> 06:04:16,740
breathtaking effects

3142
06:04:16,840 --> 06:04:19,400
Not a silly costume in sight

3143
06:04:20,360 --> 06:04:23,560
Ever wanted to wear your underpants over your trousers

3144
06:04:25,080 --> 06:04:27,830
Rippling muscles

3145
06:04:27,909 --> 06:04:29,909
I just need testing

3146
06:04:30,709 --> 06:04:32,709
fiercer than a ranting mom

3147
06:04:33,880 --> 06:04:36,599
I told you I was going to make work out here hungry mouse

3148
06:04:39,209 --> 06:04:41,529
faster than waiting for a bus

3149
06:04:45,110 --> 06:04:47,110
So when you're feeling low

3150
06:04:47,569 --> 06:04:48,869

3151
06:04:48,869 --> 06:04:51,080
Everyone's super

3152
06:04:51,080 --> 06:04:56,520
From yesterday. Um, i'm sorry. No what you're looking at here is you're looking at something I did

3153
06:04:57,240 --> 06:04:59,240
Uh to at least two days ago

3154
06:05:00,040 --> 06:05:02,040
Yes, so this was the 17th

3155
06:05:02,840 --> 06:05:06,229
so this was

3156
06:05:06,229 --> 06:05:09,299
Like two or three days ago. Yeah

3157
06:05:09,299 --> 06:05:13,299
I told you I was in it. What am I gonna this shirt was clean. Am I gonna wash the shirt?

3158
06:05:13,299 --> 06:05:15,299
I put it up for five seconds

3159
06:05:16,979 --> 06:05:20,419
I put this shirt on did the test and was like i'm ready to stream and I couldn't scream

3160
06:05:20,819 --> 06:05:24,340
So that I just took off the shirt and it went back to bed. I didn't go to bed

3161
06:05:24,419 --> 06:05:26,419
But I I like I don't know what I did something

3162
06:05:27,619 --> 06:05:30,099
The shirt's a little dirty. It's dirty now. Oh, absolutely

3163
06:05:30,659 --> 06:05:32,020

06:05:53,529 --> 06:05:56,090
No, I wasn't throwing up a high batted smell that was the robe

Look at how dark it is in here now

3171
06:06:05,299 --> 06:06:11,240
It was this that's what you were smelling and that's what I was smelling but that's what I was relaying to you

3172
06:06:15,689 --> 06:06:18,169
E that's the e3 striat. That is the e3 striat bro

3173
06:06:19,900 --> 06:06:22,459
Oh man, does everybody have the the boogers coming out of my nose?

3174
06:06:23,740 --> 06:06:25,740
I kind of want to see it. Let me turn this down

3175
06:06:27,110 --> 06:06:29,110
Does anybody have like the snot coming out of my nose?

3176
06:06:36,409 --> 06:06:37,939
Right there

3177
06:06:37,939 --> 06:06:39,939
Is that it? Is that actually it?

3178
06:06:40,020 --> 06:06:48,659
I want to see if this actually happens. Can you actually see this?

3179
06:06:49,380 --> 06:06:54,970
I look tired

3180
06:06:54,970 --> 06:07:18,500
I don't think you can see it

3181
06:07:18,500 --> 06:07:20,500
No, thank god. This camera is like 140p

3182
06:07:22,549 --> 06:07:24,229
Perfect. You can't see shit

3183
06:07:24,229 --> 06:07:30,520
Look at that forehead shine. Well, I mean i've been running around in a circle in my room for six hours. Well five and a half

3184
06:07:33,209 --> 06:07:35,209
All right. I'm gonna call it here

3185
06:07:35,369 --> 06:07:38,009
Thank you for joining me. Um, that was you're in the movies

3186
06:07:41,700 --> 06:07:43,740
That was a lot of fun

3187
06:07:43,740 --> 06:07:47,979
That was way more fun than I really thought about I just I I saw it and I had to get it head play

3188
06:07:48,779 --> 06:07:51,900
Hope you had fun

3189
06:07:51,900 --> 06:07:53,900
so what we're going to do now is

3190
06:07:54,060 --> 06:07:56,060
We're going to do the bits

3191
06:07:56,060 --> 06:07:59,900
But we're going to start with the bits that I missed a couple days ago through three days ago

3192
06:08:00,619 --> 06:08:03,290
So we're going to just going to chill

3193
06:08:03,290 --> 06:08:05,290
Uh, and we're going to go through them

3194
06:08:05,610 --> 06:08:07,610
Just going to relax and play

3195
06:08:08,279 --> 06:08:09,319
nothing

3196
06:08:09,319 --> 06:08:11,319
Maybe I should just stay on camera

3197
06:08:11,400 --> 06:08:16,279
I don't know if I know that xbox is going to like fucking explode. I'm going to turn it off

3198
06:08:17,400 --> 06:08:24,119
I feel like this thing is gonna burn out

3199
06:08:26,299 --> 06:08:28,299
Uh, can I just like go like this?

3200
06:08:30,970 --> 06:08:37,849
nice face cam

3201
06:08:37,849 --> 06:08:42,020
Hold on. You can hear the xbox dying. You probably can

3202
06:08:44,540 --> 06:08:46,540
I just want like the square

3203
06:08:46,700 --> 06:09:12,200
What if I don't move?

3204
06:09:12,200 --> 06:09:14,200
Uh is it i'm just gonna have to go like this

3205
06:09:18,330 --> 06:09:19,689
Hey, there you go

3206
06:09:19,689 --> 06:09:26,419
Now we'll just hang out and do the other go to the other screen. Is the picture in focus? I mean sure it is

3207
06:09:27,619 --> 06:09:31,979
I guess I can just hit back right? Yeah

3208
06:09:33,939 --> 06:09:36,099
All right, if you're gonna take off, we'll see uh, we'll see you tomorrow

3209
06:09:36,819 --> 06:09:39,860
I have no idea what's going on tomorrow. I know there's some stuff that is possible

3210
06:09:40,419 --> 06:09:42,419
I wonder if star's computer works

3211
06:09:43,779 --> 06:09:46,659
Star's computer was all screwed up or something his power supply was fucked up

3212
06:09:48,700 --> 06:09:50,700
There are

3213
06:09:51,180 --> 06:09:55,419
There are like 30 dead pixels on this webcam

3214
06:09:57,220 --> 06:09:59,220
Oh my god, I burnt it out

3215
06:10:02,380 --> 06:10:04,380
One two, three, four

3216
06:10:04,619 --> 06:10:09,419
Five six seven eight nine ten you can find like oh ryan's belt in this thing

3217
06:10:11,049 --> 06:10:12,490
One two, three, four

3218
06:10:12,490 --> 06:10:17,049
Five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen

3219
06:10:20,119 --> 06:10:21,080
Wow

3220
06:10:21,080 --> 06:10:23,560
That's unbelievable. This thing really is a piece of shit, isn't it?

3221
06:10:29,049 --> 06:10:34,490
Whatever not like i'm gonna use it ever again unless I play this but I do have a second one because I bought two accidentally

3222
06:10:37,770 --> 06:10:40,409
How much was the xbox camera it here's what I didn't know

3223
06:10:41,369 --> 06:10:44,250
Uh, you're in the movies comes with one of those

3224
06:10:45,369 --> 06:10:47,369
I did not know that

3225
06:10:47,369 --> 06:10:50,729
So I bought one of those separately and it's sealed in a clamshell box

3226
06:10:51,290 --> 06:10:53,450
Uh, I didn't know you got one when you bought it. So

3227
06:10:55,130 --> 06:10:57,130
It didn't say that on the list

3228
06:10:58,500 --> 06:11:03,319
Unfortunately, so I have a second fresh one. Maybe i'll plug the fresh one in in like six months. We'll do it again

3229
06:11:05,029 --> 06:11:06,889
Sell it on ebay

3230
06:11:06,889 --> 06:11:09,720
No, I want to keep it. I want to keep it forever

3231
06:11:10,939 --> 06:11:13,580
All right, let's do the bits. Let's uh actually get this

3232
06:11:14,619 --> 06:11:20,869
Open so these are from a few days ago. We're gonna do we're gonna go through them very quickly

3233
06:11:23,299 --> 06:11:26,740
At least quick enough where we can head to the other ones too because I don't want to be too late tonight

3234
06:11:27,560 --> 06:11:31,880
Because this is a good place to kind of stop and this is what I want to have happen in the future as well

3235
06:11:32,900 --> 06:11:34,819
those of you that have been around

3236
06:11:34,819 --> 06:11:36,819
Uh just hanging out for the last

3237
06:11:37,779 --> 06:11:40,740
Maybe a couple weeks or so once or twice. I have talked about

3238
06:11:41,700 --> 06:11:44,340
Bits on the beach. Oh, yeah, I guess I could just do this couldn't I?

3239
06:11:48,090 --> 06:11:51,450
Oh, watch this ready. We'll just have like some random shit in the background

3240
06:12:00,360 --> 06:12:04,709
Ready? Watch this

3241
06:12:04,790 --> 06:12:06,389
Zits on the beach

3242
06:12:06,389 --> 06:12:10,459
That's one there's one it's hot in here

3243
06:12:27,880 --> 06:12:29,639
All right

3244
06:12:29,639 --> 06:12:32,040
Uh, let's get to the bits from a few days ago

3245
06:12:45,939 --> 06:12:47,939
Watch out for that monkey behind me. Where is he?

3246
06:12:48,759 --> 06:12:50,540
Oh, that's a lion

3247
06:12:50,540 --> 06:12:55,750
It was a monkey. Okay. So from a few days ago

3248
06:12:56,310 --> 06:13:00,040
I'm gonna put these over here actually so I can see them better

3249
06:13:02,389 --> 06:13:05,509
We had a new piece of artwork from yenwen

3250
06:13:06,150 --> 06:13:11,080
Which I want to show on screen because it was insane. It was

3251
06:13:11,720 --> 06:13:14,279
Yenwen's artwork is more detailed than my own face

3252
06:13:15,000 --> 06:13:22,099
Let me get it here

3253
06:13:22,099 --> 06:13:28,869
Take a look at this

3254
06:13:28,869 --> 06:13:33,669
You've seen it. Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's it's I there's more detail than my actual face

3255
06:13:37,720 --> 06:13:39,880
It's the chin one. Yeah, look at this

3256
06:13:46,840 --> 06:13:55,990
This shit is so fucking funny. Yeah, nice pick. I'm getting it. I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting

3257
06:13:55,990 --> 06:13:59,380
I'm gonna VPN

3258
06:13:59,380 --> 06:14:03,060
The VPN I use takes like an extra five to ten seconds to open like any websites

3259
06:14:03,700 --> 06:14:17,459
All right, here we go. Why am I in a VPN?

3260
06:14:18,180 --> 06:14:20,180
Because my internet sucks

3261
06:14:20,419 --> 06:14:25,860
And routing traffic somewhere else actually helps with my packet loss because my internet's a piece of shit

3262
06:14:26,500 --> 06:14:34,619
But look at that

3263
06:14:34,619 --> 06:14:36,619
That's from a few days ago

3264
06:14:38,549 --> 06:14:40,310
I have to shave too

3265
06:14:40,310 --> 06:14:43,580
Look at what like two days does

3266
06:14:48,599 --> 06:14:51,479
Make it an emote. You look like night crawler

3267
06:14:53,020 --> 06:14:55,689
night crawler

3268
06:14:55,689 --> 06:14:56,729
like

3269
06:14:56,729 --> 06:15:01,450
Jake jillin hall nightcrawler or like go through walls nightcrawler

3270
06:15:02,009 --> 06:15:12,900
Now that's amazing

3271
06:15:12,900 --> 06:15:14,099
both

3272
06:15:14,099 --> 06:15:18,900
But thank you yen wen for that. It's fucking fantastic

3273
06:15:19,540 --> 06:15:26,330
It's a jim carrey william depot. I'm like losing my face here

3274
06:15:26,889 --> 06:15:29,369
Slowly, it's deciding it doesn't like where I am

3275
06:15:31,880 --> 06:15:34,040
Uh, but no, that's insanely talented

3276
06:15:34,840 --> 06:15:36,840
there's so many artworks that

3277
06:15:37,159 --> 06:15:39,799
yen wen has done that are just ridiculous

3278
06:15:40,599 --> 06:15:43,740
And there's also a couple of clown car emotes

3279
06:15:44,380 --> 06:15:50,439
I might as well put this one on screen because it's fucking funny

3280
06:15:58,759 --> 06:16:10,979
Please shave take a break and break in a hot bath. You look stressed and not well. I'm all right

3281
06:16:12,599 --> 06:16:14,840
I'm fine. What's what are you talking about? I'm all right

3282
06:16:17,979 --> 06:16:19,979
I mean, I i'm i'm i'm i'm 33

3283
06:16:21,450 --> 06:16:23,450
This is what you look like when you're 33

3284
06:16:24,790 --> 06:16:28,310
I'm a 23 and i'm 33. This is just what you look like this

3285
06:16:30,009 --> 06:16:31,610
I'm doing just fine

3286
06:16:31,610 --> 06:16:36,340
And i've been jumping around in my room

3287
06:16:37,849 --> 06:16:41,049
They're telling you to take a shower. I'm going to i'm going to you better believe it when this is done

3288
06:16:44,150 --> 06:16:46,150
Uh, but let's put this on the screen

3289
06:16:58,759 --> 06:17:08,220
Come on, get over there

3290
06:17:08,220 --> 06:17:10,220
He keeps up with the roller coaster pretty well

3291
06:17:15,849 --> 06:17:22,169
I gotta like put the new shit that lord out did on this stream. I've been so busy. I haven't been able to do it

3292
06:17:29,290 --> 06:17:30,810
It's really good

3293
06:17:30,810 --> 06:17:37,369
Yeah, there's like two or three things that he that he's done that i've done

3294
06:17:37,770 --> 06:17:42,889
And I just haven't put them on because I decided to haven't had I just have been too busy to like put it all up

3295
06:17:42,889 --> 06:17:44,860
And set it all up

3296
06:17:44,860 --> 06:17:46,860
I've had it for like at least a couple weeks

3297
06:17:49,060 --> 06:17:51,060
I'm still I keep disappearing

3298
06:17:52,970 --> 06:17:55,290
But thank you. Yeah, when there's a fucking fantastic as always

3299
06:17:56,009 --> 06:17:58,259
We also had 250 from for real though

3300
06:17:59,139 --> 06:18:03,220
Jeremy i've been watching the vod for your majesty majesty stream and enjoying it

3301
06:18:04,279 --> 06:18:08,200
Uh, I thought you might suggest the dungeon keeper series and war for the overworld

3302
06:18:09,619 --> 06:18:11,619
Uh dungeon keeper is um

3303
06:18:13,529 --> 06:18:17,930
Didn't they remake dungeon keeper but it was a terrible game. Didn't they like redo it and people hated it?

3304
06:18:19,080 --> 06:18:21,080
Because it wasn't like true to the old games or something

3305
06:18:29,509 --> 06:18:31,270
Yeah, the remake sucks

3306
06:18:31,270 --> 06:18:33,799
That's too bad

3307
06:18:33,799 --> 06:18:35,799
But probably not probably not dungeon keeper

3308
06:18:36,659 --> 06:18:38,659
unless it was something that

3309
06:18:39,000 --> 06:18:42,680
I unless i've ran out of more stuff like because I have a lot of stuff that's coming that I want to do

3310
06:18:43,159 --> 06:18:45,159
It was a microtransaction nightmare

3311
06:18:46,299 --> 06:18:47,740
That's unfortunate

3312
06:18:47,740 --> 06:18:50,580
But thank you for real though

3313
06:18:50,580 --> 06:18:53,779
Uh, thank you squalled easy for the three bucks. Hey germy the other day

3314
06:18:53,779 --> 06:18:56,500
I donated two dollars to italics and he made fun of me for being poor

3315
06:18:56,819 --> 06:18:59,299
Will you cheer me up by saying the funny word which one?

3316
06:19:00,020 --> 06:19:05,659
Got lots of funny words

3317
06:19:05,740 --> 06:19:08,680
Which funny word?

3318
06:19:08,680 --> 06:19:12,200
I said I said that s word like 10 times today

3319
06:19:12,840 --> 06:19:14,279
I think you heard it

3320
06:19:14,279 --> 06:19:20,500
theater

3321
06:19:20,500 --> 06:19:22,500
Fucking lion behind me

3322
06:19:28,939 --> 06:19:31,360
Uh gondor land. Thanks for the 250

3323
06:19:32,700 --> 06:19:34,299
You say you'll stream anything recommended

3324
06:19:34,299 --> 06:19:39,259
But i've been recommending bookworm adventures for two years and recommendations channel lying streamer. I didn't say i'd play

3325
06:19:39,419 --> 06:19:43,259
I I didn't say i'd play anything recommended. What would you get that from?

3326
06:19:49,060 --> 06:19:52,580
I i'll stream anything that you tell me to stream. That's not gonna happen

3327
06:19:55,540 --> 06:19:59,860
Bookworm adventures is they can't even purchase it anymore. That shit doesn't even exist anymore. You can't buy it anywhere

3328
06:19:59,860 --> 06:20:03,540
You have to like download it for you get it from like amazon. Everything's been asking it sent to you in the mail

3329
06:20:11,259 --> 06:20:13,259
I never said I I

3330
06:20:13,259 --> 06:20:17,580
The recommendation channel is if a recommendation is not a streamer you're gonna play this

3331
06:20:18,979 --> 06:20:21,380

This documented fucking medical evidence that marijuana is like does good things for you if you have different like conditions. I didn't

That's true. That is a true statement

3357
06:22:29,380 --> 06:22:32,099
If anybody takes anything on this channel and makes it into something fun

Something interesting something like transforms it into something else

3359

Change the cutout style

3361
06:22:41,270 --> 06:22:43,909
That's making it worse

3362
06:22:43,909 --> 06:22:48,549
uh, it's really fun to see people do things to everything that happens on this channel if somebody pulls out a

3363
06:22:49,189 --> 06:22:54,069
A clip or something that we did that was fun or something or that they thought was fun or funny and they turn into something else

3364
06:22:54,069 --> 06:22:56,069
It's really interesting to see it

3365
06:23:01,720 --> 06:23:03,720

Dubski dude, thanks for the 250. Hey germa, you should seriously consider playing dark wood

3444
06:30:00,419 --> 06:30:02,500
It's one of the best horror games on steam

3445
06:30:03,139 --> 06:30:07,459
On steam really and it's sitting at a 93 with steam reviews

3446
06:30:08,020 --> 06:30:10,659
I promise you it'll make for a perfect scare saturday stream

3447
06:30:11,220 --> 06:30:15,860
Normally, I don't give people money just to recommend a game but dark wood is that good

3448
06:30:17,830 --> 06:30:20,310
Okay, also chat will love watching you shit your pants

3449
06:30:21,110 --> 06:30:25,349
Is it good?

3450
06:30:25,349 --> 06:30:26,549
How good is it?

3451
06:30:26,549 --> 06:30:35,000
It's good

3452
06:30:35,000 --> 06:30:38,919
You're doing everyone a disservice by not playing dark wood. Really?

3453
06:30:40,860 --> 06:30:42,860
Is it top down? Is that a top down game?

3454
06:30:47,930 --> 06:30:50,569
It is okay. I have seen i've seen this. I might even own this

3455
06:30:52,200 --> 06:30:56,119
I don't think of I think it was one of those things where I just bought it one day or like a steam sale or something

3456
06:30:56,119 --> 06:30:58,099
maybe

3457
06:30:58,099 --> 06:31:00,500
Uh, do you still use your instagram? I don't have an instagram

3458
06:31:01,220 --> 06:31:06,099
If you are looking at a germa 985 instagram account, it is not real. It is not a real account

3459
06:31:06,659 --> 06:31:09,799
I do not have one

3460
06:31:09,799 --> 06:31:12,439
I have a twitter and I have a facebook that i've never used

3461
06:31:15,419 --> 06:31:17,419
I don't have any of the social media accounts

3462
06:31:26,119 --> 06:31:33,669
Wait, what is this germa psycho? Why is it like why is it blood on my chin?

3463
06:31:40,919 --> 06:31:43,880
Facebook sucks. I haven't used it. I have i've made one

3464
06:31:44,840 --> 06:31:47,400
Almost 10 years ago and I have used it maybe three or four times

3471
06:32:36,200 --> 06:32:39,259
Rejection hotline at rejection hotlines.com

3472
06:32:46,090 --> 06:32:49,770
Should I make this an emote? All right. I gotta let me go through the bits

3473
06:32:50,409 --> 06:32:55,290
Let me go through the bits

3474
06:32:55,290 --> 06:33:12,599
I kept thinking about yeah, uh dead pixels. What are you talking about? Somebody's saying this dead pixels. What's what do you another arm?

3475
06:33:14,099 --> 06:33:16,540
checking monitor man

3476
06:33:16,540 --> 06:33:18,700
Your monitor seems like it might be fucked

3477
06:33:20,020 --> 06:33:21,700
I remember

3478
06:33:21,700 --> 06:33:24,419
I got a dead pixel and I bought a new computer. This is

3479
06:33:25,299 --> 06:33:29,540
It was a laptop. This is probably like 12 years ago or so probably 12 or 15 years ago

3480
06:33:29,540 --> 06:33:31,139
I got a new laptop

3481
06:33:31,139 --> 06:33:34,979
and there's a dead pixel on the monitor in the laptop and I

3482
06:33:35,540 --> 06:33:38,340
Fucking could not stand it. I lost my mind

3483
06:33:38,740 --> 06:33:44,340
I did a thing where you you heat up a little like washcloth with like hot water

3484
06:33:44,819 --> 06:33:48,099
And then you take the hot damp pad and you like massage

3485
06:33:48,500 --> 06:33:52,819
I gave this thing eight like four hour massage trying to massage out this dead pixel

3486
06:33:56,490 --> 06:33:58,220
It didn't work

3487
06:33:58,220 --> 06:34:01,020
Just like pushing and massaging and they say tap

3488
06:34:01,659 --> 06:34:05,500
You see I sat there tapping on this dead pixel for hours

3489
06:34:06,380 --> 06:34:10,150
It didn't do anything and it drove me nuts

3490
06:34:12,220 --> 06:34:17,659
Has that ever worked for anybody by the way has like tapping the dead pixel article that you get from on the internet

3491
06:34:17,659 --> 06:34:19,659
That's that one person tells you to do it

3492
06:34:20,380 --> 06:34:22,619
Has that ever worked for anybody?

3493
06:34:24,250 --> 06:34:26,250
No, no, no, no. No. Yeah

3494
06:34:28,790 --> 06:34:33,909
Why would that work? I guess it's you you it gets the electricity to get stick in there and

3495
06:34:35,450 --> 06:34:37,450
Get in there and

3496
06:34:37,450 --> 06:34:40,169
Move it around and the crystal. I don't know. I have no idea

3497
06:34:40,889 --> 06:34:45,139
Should I try to fix these?

3498
06:34:48,540 --> 06:34:53,099
Are those dead pixels here or those like dead pixels on on more of them appeared?

3499
06:34:53,900 --> 06:34:57,529
Is that the 360?

3500
06:34:57,529 --> 06:34:59,529
How many are there?

3501
06:34:59,529 --> 06:35:01,529
Shit, there's way more than I thought

3502
06:35:02,779 --> 06:35:04,779
Yes, I'll maybe take a look at the top left

3503
06:35:06,299 --> 06:35:11,110
That's venus up there

3504
06:35:11,110 --> 06:35:13,189
God

3505
06:35:13,189 --> 06:35:15,990
Oh fuck. Well, I may have just made it worse

3506
06:35:16,709 --> 06:35:40,099
It's broken

3507
06:35:40,099 --> 06:35:46,500
Hey, i'm just kidding now we're in focus

3508
06:35:52,599 --> 06:35:54,360
Okay

3509
06:35:54,360 --> 06:35:56,360
Uh, where were we?

3510
06:35:56,360 --> 06:35:58,630
I forget right here

3511
06:35:58,630 --> 06:36:01,189
Oh dark wood, right? All right. Maybe i'll maybe i'll try it

3512
06:36:01,750 --> 06:36:04,150
I don't know. I have to look into it. I have to see that because I don't

3513
06:36:05,770 --> 06:36:07,849
That's it on my fucking hand

3514
06:36:10,099 --> 06:36:16,700
What is that?

3515
06:36:16,700 --> 06:36:18,700
Like that's a pimple on my hand. That's not a

3516
06:36:20,419 --> 06:36:22,259
What is that?

3517
06:36:22,259 --> 06:36:24,580
That's a pimple on my hand. Can you get those?

3518
06:36:26,520 --> 06:36:33,020
That's not a wart

3519
06:36:33,020 --> 06:36:36,540
It's I think it's irritation

3520
06:36:36,540 --> 06:36:44,060
That's not that's not a word. Look at I think I have a zit on my hand

3521
06:36:46,419 --> 06:36:50,580
Oh, you know what it is. It's from resting my finger here and getting that indentation

3522
06:36:51,060 --> 06:36:53,060
It's not a liver spot

3523
06:36:53,400 --> 06:36:57,740
I'm not that old

3524
06:36:57,740 --> 06:36:59,740
Uh, thank you to

3525
06:37:00,939 --> 06:37:06,860
A uh, I know princess of misery for the five dollars. I drew this for you dad. I hope you're proud of me

3526
06:37:07,419 --> 06:37:10,790
P.s. I hope they cast you as the green goblin in the new spider-man franchise

3527
06:37:16,540 --> 06:37:20,840
Yeah, i'm like jacked

3528
06:37:20,840 --> 06:37:29,450
I could be a fucking green goblin. I swear too much though. Let's put this a lot of artwork

3529
06:37:29,689 --> 06:37:31,689
You guys are really killing it with the artwork here

3530
06:37:32,090 --> 06:37:45,990
Let's get it on. Uh, this is me

3531
06:37:46,790 --> 06:37:49,029
This is like what I actually look like with no shirt on

3532
06:37:51,939 --> 06:37:53,939
So you just had to call me short

3533
06:37:53,939 --> 06:38:00,360
It's pretty accurate to how big I am

3534
06:38:01,400 --> 06:38:09,659
At least in the chest area

3535
06:38:09,659 --> 06:38:13,369
This is not safe for work

3536
06:38:13,770 --> 06:38:15,270
What?

3537
06:38:15,270 --> 06:38:16,630
It's fat

3538
06:38:16,630 --> 06:38:18,630
No, I got those broad shoulders

3539
06:38:18,709 --> 06:38:28,680
That's what my mother told me at least

3540
06:38:28,759 --> 06:38:32,279
But thank you, uh princess of misery. That was very very very very good shit

3541
06:38:33,240 --> 06:38:35,540
All the artwork has been stellar

3542
06:38:35,540 --> 06:38:39,430
So, thank you an anonymous cheerer. Thanks for the 250

3543
06:38:40,619 --> 06:38:42,619
Uh, that's it. Just 250

3544
06:38:42,779 --> 06:38:47,830
Clueless sniper. Thanks for the 250 the germ of that face you made inspired me to make this

3545
06:38:51,060 --> 06:38:59,669
I feel like i've seen this character somewhere, right?

3546
06:39:19,119 --> 06:39:20,580
spider-man

3547
06:39:20,580 --> 06:39:22,020
spider-man

3548
06:39:22,020 --> 06:39:25,270
Oh, that's the green goblin. I'm fucking stupid

3549
06:39:47,619 --> 06:39:51,529
Not bad. I don't think I could do it. Not bad

3550
06:39:52,970 --> 06:39:58,490
Uh, but no, thank you for that. Are you actually a boomer? No, i'm 33. I'm still a millennial. I'm just like you

3551
06:39:59,909 --> 06:40:04,810
I'm just like you i'm 33. I was born in 85. I'm a millennial

3552
06:40:07,779 --> 06:40:11,380
I'm not a boomer a boomer would be I would be gen

3553
06:40:12,580 --> 06:40:15,540
X or something

3554
06:40:15,540 --> 06:40:18,419
If I was like 83 or 82 or something

3555
06:40:19,580 --> 06:40:21,580
I am a millennial

3556
06:40:21,580 --> 06:40:23,700
Just like you

3557
06:40:23,700 --> 06:40:25,700
Or some of you guys are zoomers

3558
06:40:32,520 --> 06:40:35,659
Jen jex

3559
06:40:36,889 --> 06:40:41,450
Okay, uh, we were at uh, that was clueless sniper. Thank you clueless sniper for that artwork

3560
06:40:42,090 --> 06:40:45,849
Clueless sniper again for 250. I think this is a double message here

3561
06:40:46,490 --> 06:40:48,009
it is

3562
06:40:48,009 --> 06:40:52,169
Uh, but thank you for the goblin the green goblin. Thanks for the five dollars a few days ago

3563
06:40:53,209 --> 06:40:57,130
Errorless thanks for the 250 streamer rages at in-game character

3564
06:40:57,849 --> 06:41:01,560
Was it playing three days ago? Oh

3565
06:41:01,959 --> 06:41:04,919
metal wolf chaos

3566
06:41:04,919 --> 06:41:06,279
I beat that game

3567
06:41:06,279 --> 06:41:08,580
I forgot about that. It's kind of a blur

3568
06:41:11,299 --> 06:41:13,299
Uh, but thank you errorless for the 250

3569
06:41:15,930 --> 06:41:19,930
All right, this is right when I was in the middle of just being very upset at everything in the world, right

3570
06:41:20,889 --> 06:41:25,930
Man boy 777. Thanks for the 250. Hey germa. I've been wondering how can I be more like you?

3571
06:41:26,729 --> 06:41:28,970
I've been cursed with incredibly thick hair

3572
06:41:29,529 --> 06:41:32,169
And i'm really getting tired of it. How did you get your hair so thin?

3573
06:41:42,299 --> 06:41:46,939
Uh errorless. Thanks for the 250 again. Is he still doing his old hat charade?

3574
06:41:49,430 --> 06:41:51,349
old hat charade

3575
06:41:51,349 --> 06:42:01,529
What do you mean old hat? What were we talking about? What hat charade? I don't

3576
06:42:01,689 --> 06:42:05,110
I'm not sure

3577
06:42:05,110 --> 06:42:13,750
I don't know

3578
06:42:13,750 --> 06:42:18,040
You look nice today

3579
06:42:18,040 --> 06:42:22,759
Do you drink milk ice? Please answer. It's very important. No, I don't drink milk over ice

3580
06:42:23,720 --> 06:42:26,139
I don't drink milk anymore

3581
06:42:26,139 --> 06:42:28,139
I can't my stomach can't handle it

3582
06:42:28,540 --> 06:42:30,540
My intestines can't handle it

3583
06:42:30,939 --> 06:42:32,939
But thank you pin for the 250

3584

Hell, yeah

3586
06:42:39,369 --> 06:42:42,490
The whole process has been a surreal experience and I've spent most of this week figuring out

3587
06:42:42,490 --> 06:42:45,529
How i'm going to live now that i'm moving away from all my friends and family

3588
06:42:46,009 --> 06:42:50,810
It's crazy to think that in the middle in middle school. You're originally just some funny tf2 youtube guy

3589
06:42:51,450 --> 06:42:55,450
I enjoyed watching and now that's evolved into becoming one of the most consistent parts of my life

3590
06:42:57,669 --> 06:42:59,659
And there's a part two

3591
06:42:59,659 --> 06:43:02,060
Uh worse of all congrats. That's fucking awesome

3592
06:43:03,400 --> 06:43:07,080
Uh, they say knowing that at least one part of my life is going to stay consistent in these

3593
06:43:07,619 --> 06:43:09,479
Turmulous times

3594
06:43:09,479 --> 06:43:14,360
Uh brings me a bit of comfort plan on catching you strange whenever I can in between my civil engineering classes

3595
06:43:14,840 --> 06:43:16,840
Hope nothing but the best comes your way pal

3596
06:43:17,400 --> 06:43:18,520

You're gonna do just fine

3600
06:43:25,610 --> 06:43:29,049
Um happy anytime somebody says that they're pursuing something that they want to do

3601

3611
06:44:04,380 --> 06:44:06,380
Shave the first part in the last part off of that and you can

06:44:07,909 --> 06:44:12,470
That's not yeah, I died that that is a german na5 stream reference and I don't want to be used in your

06:44:17,189 --> 06:44:21,669
Joey smells just fine from what i've been told for I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea

3616
06:44:26,389 --> 06:44:29,110
I'm not there. So I can't tell you that if he does or he doesn't

3617
06:44:30,229 --> 06:44:31,909
I don't think probably doesn't

3618
06:44:31,909 --> 06:44:37,700
Moving on. Oh, are you going to up dog university?

3619
06:44:40,659 --> 06:44:47,060
What's up dog anyways

3620

06:44:51,240 --> 06:44:52,680
No, they'll be doing that

3622
06:44:52,680 --> 06:44:55,240
Now I think they like came up with that in the fucking egyptian times

3623

Uh dead medic. Thanks for the 15 bucks dead medic. Thank you playing but thank you

3627
06:45:20,900 --> 06:45:22,900
I always hate saying stuff like that

3628
06:45:23,369 --> 06:45:26,060
because

3629
06:45:26,060 --> 06:45:28,459
People like that people like shit and you don't want to

3635
06:46:03,340 --> 06:46:07,180
Hey, if I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't have played it for 12 hours. Let's put it that way

3636
06:46:07,259 --> 06:46:09,259
I got enjoyment out of it. However, I did

3637

But it ends in like 10 minutes and I can't find the shirts

3646
06:46:47,830 --> 06:46:51,240

I see. All right

3654
06:47:23,659 --> 06:47:27,180
That's gonna be fun. I'll be playing that

3655
06:47:27,799 --> 06:47:30,599
Maybe not even on stream because I don't know if i'll be able to

3656
06:47:31,319 --> 06:47:33,689
I'm gonna break one of those servers

3657
06:47:35,319 --> 06:47:37,319
Hey guys, i'm playing under

3658
06:47:37,479 --> 06:47:39,759
shadow more

3659
06:47:39,759 --> 06:47:41,279
I'm streaming it

3660
06:47:41,279 --> 06:47:44,159
Oh, what's what's that behind me?

3661
06:47:44,400 --> 06:47:48,080
What's that? Oh, is that a stampede of like 600 fucking people?

3662
06:47:48,799 --> 06:47:54,430
Not gonna be I wanted to do that. I wanted to do that initially, but they're not gonna have enough servers to do that

3663
06:47:58,189 --> 06:48:01,069
There are actual stream servers if you still trigger really

3664
06:48:04,509 --> 06:48:06,750
only 600

3665
06:48:06,830 --> 06:48:09,790
How do they all right? Let me ask you this. I I don't know much about

3666
06:48:10,669 --> 06:48:18,590
Warcraft streamers or warcraft players or anything. I really don't but I know that there are warcraft streamers that have thousands and thousands of viewers

3667
06:48:19,799 --> 06:48:21,799
How do they not break the servers?

3668
06:48:24,540 --> 06:48:29,099
Yeah mutton street people that have like two three four five thousand more viewers than I do

3669
06:48:32,200 --> 06:48:36,759
How do you not like flood a thousand two thousand people somewhere and just crush it?

3670
06:48:37,560 --> 06:48:42,619
Do you just kind of hide where you play?

3671
06:48:43,020 --> 06:48:49,580
Do you just try to go to like a low population server?

3672
06:48:50,459 --> 06:48:58,409
because they did that thing with um

3673
06:48:59,869 --> 06:49:02,110
That like instancing servers together, right?

3674
06:49:07,020 --> 06:49:08,169
But

3675
06:49:08,169 --> 06:49:14,009
I have this weird fear that if I ever wanted to stream that game if there was only like 10 to 20 servers in wild classic

3676
06:49:14,889 --> 06:49:17,290
and a ton of people were streaming it and

3677
06:49:18,569 --> 06:49:23,290
50 to 100 000 people and even not just people that are playing with like the streamers

3678
06:49:24,009 --> 06:49:27,689
But just people that are trying to load into the game just because they want to play wild classic

3679
06:49:29,369 --> 06:49:32,330
I think they severely underestimate how many people want to play that game

3680
06:49:33,290 --> 06:49:38,110
Severely more people want to play wild classic they want to play real actual current. Wow

3681
06:49:39,549 --> 06:49:49,209
How many people are still subbed to wow but a couple million?

3682
06:49:50,009 --> 06:49:52,889
One two three million something like that. Maybe a little bit more

3683
06:49:54,700 --> 06:49:57,020
I would assume at least a couple million people are going to want to do that

3684
06:49:57,819 --> 06:50:04,360
Aren't they like three or four hundred regular servers?

3685
06:50:05,159 --> 06:50:08,750
Two to three million. Yeah

3686
06:50:08,750 --> 06:50:17,630
any more servers

3687
06:50:17,630 --> 06:50:19,630
uh, but thank you

3688
06:50:19,709 --> 06:50:26,990
Thank you mega big gargantuan for the four dollars first try after loadout swap, that's true. I do remember that specifically

3689
06:50:27,709 --> 06:50:36,509
Uh, thank you. Nile orian for the six dollars. Wait, you need money

3690
06:50:37,310 --> 06:50:39,310
In the game. I'll start with in-game currency

3691
06:50:39,630 --> 06:50:46,509
How was my day weekend? It was a little stressful. I'm not gonna lie because the internet

3692
06:50:47,310 --> 06:50:49,310
I was supposed to stream the last two days in a row

3693
06:50:49,549 --> 06:50:52,750
But just couldn't because the internet was broken. It seems to be back to normal

3694
06:50:54,200 --> 06:50:56,200
So I kind of had a stressful weekend

3695
06:50:56,360 --> 06:51:03,819
I'm not gonna lie. Just got a sec. I have we got a stress pimple

3696
06:51:07,500 --> 06:51:12,139
Uh, but almost done with from a few days ago and then we're gonna move on to the bits from today

3697
06:51:13,529 --> 06:51:16,880
Shouldn't take as much longer

3698
06:51:16,880 --> 06:51:22,479
Uh back in thanks for the 250 great 11 plus hour stream much boomer meltdowns. Holy moly. I'm tired of the mess

3699
06:51:22,959 --> 06:51:24,959
Much love to you germa and chat. Love y'all

3700
06:51:26,110 --> 06:51:29,869
Thanks for sticking around for that the whole thing if you were there for the whole thing. That was a long stream

3701
06:51:31,979 --> 06:51:34,860
Future gamer. Thanks for the 250

3702
06:51:34,860 --> 06:51:38,439
Uh, here's my burger edit. This is so gross

3703
06:51:39,000 --> 06:51:45,340
I'm hungry too. You just made me hungry

3704
06:51:48,119 --> 06:51:50,759
Well, I mean this doesn't make me hungry

3705
06:51:52,360 --> 06:51:57,240
But you said burger and now I want one of those and how it's still early. It's only like 8 30

3706
06:51:57,240 --> 06:51:59,000
This is what happens. This is what

3707
06:51:59,000 --> 06:52:03,470
I lost my train of thought but over the next couple months

3708
06:52:04,270 --> 06:52:06,270
I'm gonna start pulling streams back

3709
06:52:06,889 --> 06:52:08,029
permanently

3710
06:52:08,029 --> 06:52:10,029
To this time that I started today

3711
06:52:10,430 --> 06:52:15,229
I'm gonna start streams at about 1 to 2 pm pacific maybe somewhere around 12 and 2

3712
06:52:16,430 --> 06:52:19,470
I'm pulling back to the streams permanently a couple hours

3713
06:52:20,669 --> 06:52:24,759
All right. Now get this off the screen

3714
06:52:25,520 --> 06:52:27,520
people are eating spaghetti for god's sake

3715
06:52:29,840 --> 06:52:31,799
so

3716
06:52:31,799 --> 06:52:34,759
2 pm pacific is probably going to be when most of them start

3717
06:52:35,740 --> 06:52:37,740
and the reason why

3718
06:52:37,900 --> 06:52:39,900
Is i've started to realize something

3719
06:52:40,700 --> 06:52:46,299
I've been streaming longer than ever before yeah this last year i've been live

3720
06:52:47,180 --> 06:52:49,180
for at least

3721
06:52:49,680 --> 06:52:50,880
like

3722
06:52:50,880 --> 06:52:56,080
Five and a half to eight hours six to seven six to eight hours almost every single stream

3723
06:52:56,639 --> 06:53:00,319
And what ends up happening is once you start a stream at three or four o'clock pacific

3724
06:53:00,799 --> 06:53:06,159
Four five six seven eight nine ten eleven pacific twelve pacific even we try we we trickle in

3725
06:53:06,959 --> 06:53:12,000
It that's three a.m. Eastern that's like six five six seven a.m.

3726
06:53:12,560 --> 06:53:14,560
uh europe

3727
06:53:14,720 --> 06:53:18,479
So i've been streaming for longer therefore. I don't want to keep

3728
06:53:19,439 --> 06:53:22,880
Half the world awake if they want to stick around and watch a stream

3729
06:53:25,000 --> 06:53:28,119
So pulling the streams back to like 1 2 pm pacific

3730
06:53:29,000 --> 06:53:34,680
Allows streams to stop before it gets to be more than 11 or 12 o'clock eastern

3731
06:53:34,680 --> 06:53:36,119
Eastern

3732
06:53:36,119 --> 06:53:38,119
I used to do that shit

3733
06:53:38,990 --> 06:53:41,310
Back in massachusetts. I would stream till

3734
06:53:42,110 --> 06:53:46,750
You know i'd start at seven o'clock. I used to start at 7 pm eastern time and that was late

3735
06:53:47,310 --> 06:53:49,310
Thinking about that now that was that's a night time

3736
06:53:49,950 --> 06:53:52,189
Seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two

3737
06:53:52,830 --> 06:53:54,830
I don't really want to do that anymore

3738
06:53:55,229 --> 06:54:00,349
He thinks he's keeping people awake. Well i'm not keeping people awake

3739
06:54:00,430 --> 06:54:03,229
I just there i've gotten a lot of feedback about how

3740
06:54:03,790 --> 06:54:08,590
Oh, I really wish I could stick around but it's four o'clock in the morning eastern it's like oh, yeah

3741
06:54:08,669 --> 06:54:10,029
I guess it is

3742
06:54:10,029 --> 06:54:12,830
I'm i'm like in one of those really early time zones

3743
06:54:14,560 --> 06:54:16,729
so

3744
06:54:16,729 --> 06:54:19,849
It'll be something i'll trickle in. I mean this stream started at like 130

3745
06:54:20,729 --> 06:54:22,970
You can expect that same kind of window

3746
06:54:23,290 --> 06:54:26,569
Like one to two like 12 to one one to two something like that

3747
06:54:27,450 --> 06:54:33,919
So I like clam chowder. Yeah, it's good

3748
06:54:34,240 --> 06:54:36,060
Take out the clams

3749
06:54:36,060 --> 06:54:39,819
Add some potatoes and some corn and you got me you got me there. I'm not a big fan of clams

3750
06:54:40,380 --> 06:54:42,860
Fried clams are all right, but uh claims kind of freaked me out

3751
06:54:45,119 --> 06:54:48,159
I'm more of a corn. I'm more of i'm a fish chowder person. I like fish chowder

3752
06:54:48,720 --> 06:54:50,720
I don't really like clams though

3753
06:54:51,580 --> 06:54:54,520
but anyways

3754
06:54:54,520 --> 06:54:56,599
Uh marvosh mcgally. Thanks for the 250

3755
06:54:56,599 --> 06:55:00,759
It's always fascinating leaving the stream at 1 a.m and finding you still streaming at 9 a.m

3756
06:55:01,319 --> 06:55:04,680
After waking up. Hope you enjoyed this weird game. Good night

3757
06:55:07,580 --> 06:55:10,720
Good night again, and that takes us to today

3758
06:55:12,959 --> 06:55:16,799
So why don't we open that up now?

3759
06:55:16,799 --> 06:55:18,409
earlier today

3760
06:55:18,409 --> 06:55:23,020
We're gonna go back to earlier here. We are we had

3761
06:55:23,900 --> 06:55:25,900
Three dollars from stefunky chicken today

3762
06:55:27,639 --> 06:55:29,880
Look up germa scares a room full of children on youtube

3763
06:55:32,360 --> 06:55:35,000
What is this? Is it do I really need to look this up?

3764
06:55:43,759 --> 06:55:44,959
again

3765
06:55:44,959 --> 06:55:50,400
Germa scares a room full of children

3766
06:55:58,720 --> 06:56:00,720
Well, I I don't I can't see it

3767
06:56:00,880 --> 06:56:04,409
Where where is it?

3768
06:56:04,409 --> 06:56:05,770
on youtube

3769
06:56:05,770 --> 06:56:11,849
Somebody already has it. Is that it right there?

3770
06:56:12,169 --> 06:56:22,540
Germa scares a room full of children

3771
06:56:42,349 --> 06:56:44,909
My computer's under my desk. So I have to I had to plug my headphones in

3772
06:56:46,409 --> 06:56:48,409
All right, germa scares a room full of children

3773
06:57:10,139 --> 06:57:13,740
What where

3774
06:57:13,740 --> 06:57:15,740
What I what happened?

3775
06:57:17,470 --> 06:57:37,040
Hold on a second

3776
06:57:37,040 --> 06:57:40,799
Why did you do jojo poses because I didn't know what they were

3777
06:57:41,819 --> 06:57:43,819
I had request. I had a list

3778
06:57:44,619 --> 06:57:47,180
One about that green screen stream. There were

3779
06:57:48,040 --> 06:57:49,419
hundreds

3780
06:57:49,419 --> 06:57:51,419
hundreds of requests

3781
06:57:52,220 --> 06:57:56,939
Hundreds of them and I had on a list and it was jojo poses and I didn't know what the fuck they were

3782
06:57:58,119 --> 06:57:59,080
I just like okay

3783
06:57:59,080 --> 06:58:01,880
I guess I had to get uh chat had to help me

3784
06:58:02,439 --> 06:58:05,240
They had to I had to find like youtube videos to see what they even were

3785
06:58:09,419 --> 06:58:11,419
I don't know what a jojo pose was

3786
06:58:15,919 --> 06:58:21,130
And I did all of them all of them. I think I didn't I think there was two that I didn't do

3787
06:58:22,409 --> 06:58:29,959
I'm the jojo pose green screen guy now. I've never I have not even seen a second of that show

3788
06:58:31,799 --> 06:58:34,200
I couldn't if you okay if you lined up and in the lineup

3789
06:58:34,840 --> 06:58:38,200
All the characters from that show I wouldn't be able to tell you which one of them was jojo

3790
06:58:40,459 --> 06:58:42,779
That's how completely ignorant I am to this whole thing

3791
06:58:50,189 --> 06:58:58,750
I don't know which one of them would be the man. I don't know who it is. But anyways, that was uh,

3792
06:59:01,900 --> 06:59:05,900
That was a stefunky chicken. I watched it. It was a little it was a little strange

3793
06:59:07,819 --> 06:59:10,700
Jeff gave five community subs. We had five from jeff

3794
06:59:11,340 --> 06:59:12,380
earlier

3795
06:59:12,380 --> 06:59:14,459
Beginning of the stream. I kind of was over there and not

3796
06:59:15,259 --> 06:59:18,619
Paying attention. I didn't have like stream labs really in my view

3797
06:59:19,340 --> 06:59:25,659
But thanks with the five community subs also, holy there was a lot of money earlier that I just did not see

3798
06:59:26,700 --> 06:59:27,740
a lot

3799
06:59:27,740 --> 06:59:29,740
Uh, first of all fiti gave

3800
06:59:30,380 --> 06:59:31,880
fiti gave

3801
06:59:31,880 --> 06:59:36,810
64 dollars

3802
06:59:36,810 --> 06:59:39,290
They say don't mind me getting my next bit badge

3803
06:59:40,009 --> 06:59:42,009
Holy shit. Jeremiah

3804
06:59:42,090 --> 06:59:44,970
Wait, hold on. Wait, wait

3805
06:59:44,970 --> 06:59:51,849
Holy fucking shit. You fucking suck at this dude, man. You're so bad at this game. I didn't even know it was possible

3806
06:59:53,389 --> 06:59:57,689
Just kidding. I love you

3807
06:59:57,689 --> 07:00:01,450
Uh, it was 64 from fiti. That's a shitload of money. Thank you

3808
07:00:07,209 --> 07:00:09,689
and then

3809
07:00:09,689 --> 07:00:11,209
That's a lot

3810
07:00:11,209 --> 07:00:17,630
And then right after that ape 808 gave 50 bucks that you ape money for you

3811
07:00:20,080 --> 07:00:22,880
That's a shitload of money. That's I didn't even see these

3812
07:00:24,169 --> 07:00:28,330
Bala koala gave 50 as well play the test germa son. I did

3813
07:00:29,049 --> 07:00:31,680
I ended up doing it. That was 150 in the first

3814

07:02:20,840 --> 07:02:23,000
Thanks for the the five dollars

3839
07:02:23,880 --> 07:02:25,319
Five dollars

3840
07:02:25,319 --> 07:02:29,959
This money is for auto. He is a good boy in case my last bit message you got lost in the matrix

07:02:29,959 --> 07:02:31,959
Here's the drawing. I wanted you to see

07:02:36,119 --> 07:02:38,040
Uh shirtless germa

3844
07:02:38,040 --> 07:02:39,880
It was very very very good

3845
07:02:39,880 --> 07:02:42,029
That's exactly what it looked like

3846
07:02:42,029 --> 07:02:46,270
And they also say can you adopt me by the way i'm 21, but I hope that's not an issue. I love you dad

3847
07:02:49,069 --> 07:02:54,029
Uh, I I don't think that's I don't think that's possible. I can't take on any children

3848
07:02:56,119 --> 07:03:00,279
I have trouble tying my own shoes. I don't think I could ever take care of another person

3849
07:03:01,240 --> 07:03:05,209
21 year olds could be useful

3850
07:03:05,770 --> 07:03:11,340
Well, that I get you that that was that that's like a boomer thing to say I didn't say it

3851
07:03:12,380 --> 07:03:14,700
Oh, wow, get rid of my son gets to be

3852
07:03:16,779 --> 07:03:19,740
16 so you can roll the fucking lawn

3853
07:03:21,689 --> 07:03:24,569
That's a boomer comment there and you guys call me the boomer

3854
07:03:28,830 --> 07:03:31,069
Am I gonna do a meet and greet one day? I do them all the time

3855
07:03:34,520 --> 07:03:35,959
I don't really

3856
07:03:36,040 --> 07:03:38,599
I'm not like a meat. I'm not a meet and greet kind of person though

3857
07:03:41,279 --> 07:03:43,279
I don't know. I just never really have been

3858
07:03:45,709 --> 07:03:49,979
What's my mouth?

3859
07:03:49,979 --> 07:03:56,540
I during like packs and places like twitchcon or any of those convention type places

3860
07:03:57,340 --> 07:04:01,119
I'll usually tweet something. Hey, i'm gonna be standing here for the next

3861
07:04:01,759 --> 07:04:03,840
Hour if you want to say hello come say hello

3862
07:04:07,689 --> 07:04:10,970
I don't think i'm ever gonna have one of those scenarios where i'm standing at a booth

3863
07:04:11,610 --> 07:04:17,130
And there's a line of people to say hello and shake my hand I don't want to do that not into that

3864
07:04:20,220 --> 07:04:23,099
Feels weird for me at least for me. I that this is a personal thing

3865
07:04:30,409 --> 07:04:32,409
I I have more

3866
07:04:33,880 --> 07:04:35,159
fun

3867
07:04:35,159 --> 07:04:37,240
Knowing that we're all here together collectively

3868
07:04:38,119 --> 07:04:40,119
And if I do a meet and greet

3869
07:04:40,119 --> 07:04:43,319
Everyone's just hanging out. We're sitting around. We're talking about stuff

3870
07:04:43,959 --> 07:04:45,799
I'm not really into the whole

3871
07:04:45,799 --> 07:04:49,639
How are you? Good to see you. Have a nice day. Hey, how are you? Good to see you stay in school

3872
07:04:49,959 --> 07:04:55,560
Hey, what's that? Oh, I like that pin stay in school. Eat your vegetables. Goodbye. See you later back to the next person

3873
07:04:56,119 --> 07:04:58,119
It's I don't I don't like it

3874
07:04:58,119 --> 07:05:01,959
and that's not to say there's anything there's nothing wrong with that it just personally it just

3875
07:05:03,959 --> 07:05:05,959
It just feels weird for me. It does

3876
07:05:07,400 --> 07:05:11,400
It's nothing like that. I know but i'm just saying i'm a weirdo. I'm a weird fucking person

3877
07:05:17,819 --> 07:05:20,139
i'm a strange person and I think

3878
07:05:21,979 --> 07:05:30,360
Lightning bolts just go off in my brain every second. That's the awkward talk you have with your uncle

3879
07:05:32,360 --> 07:05:39,770
Stay in school

3880
07:05:39,770 --> 07:05:41,770
How is it nothing like that? It is like that

3881
07:05:43,959 --> 07:05:45,959
I guess it depends on who it is, right?

3882
07:05:48,750 --> 07:05:53,790
Ever considered going to do a small convention having a panel where you just fool around for 30 minutes?

3883
07:05:55,020 --> 07:05:57,560
I've thought about it

3884
07:05:57,560 --> 07:05:59,560
But anytime I go to a convention

3885
07:06:01,770 --> 07:06:04,569
I I sort of I turn into a little bit of a recluse

3886
07:06:05,450 --> 07:06:10,490
I don't really read I just kind of like poke around and look at stuff and okay

3887
07:06:10,970 --> 07:06:12,490
Hmm

3888
07:06:12,490 --> 07:06:14,490
Call of duty looks all right

3889
07:06:16,889 --> 07:06:20,970
There's a new uh new barrel feed look at I don't I don't hey look at me

3890
07:06:21,049 --> 07:06:25,849
It's me turbo dot at five. Welcome to the channel. I don't I just kind of do my own thing

3891
07:06:29,229 --> 07:06:32,590
some people really love to go to conventions and

3892
07:06:33,310 --> 07:06:34,909
Turn it on

3893
07:06:34,909 --> 07:06:38,110
And here we go. I'm fucking here and i'm ready

3894
07:06:39,000 --> 07:06:43,080
I like to dial it down almost to zero when i'm just walking around a convention

3895
07:06:45,720 --> 07:06:47,159
Go undercover

3896
07:06:47,159 --> 07:06:49,159
No, but people I've had people grab me before

3897
07:06:50,560 --> 07:06:54,240
You know, oh, hey, I I think I know who you are and i'm like, oh, yeah

3898
07:06:54,400 --> 07:06:57,919
Oh, it's interesting and we just kind of hang out and talk for a minute. That's it. I'm into that

3899
07:07:00,810 --> 07:07:06,009
But I don't think i'm not sure I didn't want to do unless it was something I had complete in total 100 control over

3900
07:07:06,569 --> 07:07:08,569
I'm, not sure I'd want to do a panel

3901
07:07:08,889 --> 07:07:10,409
Where hey coming?

3902
07:07:10,409 --> 07:07:14,970
Hey, what next? What do you want to ask me? I bet you know, you know, it's weirdly enough

3903
07:07:15,049 --> 07:07:17,290
You don't want santa when he's the mall santa

3904
07:07:18,490 --> 07:07:20,810
And like people come up and they they talk to the mall santa

3905
07:07:22,009 --> 07:07:24,009
Like oh, what do you want for christmas?

3906
07:07:24,409 --> 07:07:26,490
Well, uh, I want you know, I just I just

3907
07:07:27,450 --> 07:07:29,869
It freaks me out a little

3908
07:07:29,869 --> 07:07:33,069
Because I don't think I have very many answers for like a panel

3909
07:07:35,450 --> 07:07:37,610
He's comparing himself to god

3910
07:07:42,200 --> 07:07:44,759
No, i'm comparing myself to a mall santa

3911
07:07:46,250 --> 07:07:51,849
That is um, I think that's a little far off than what you are describing

3912
07:07:52,569 --> 07:07:57,790
Oh, he's comparing himself to god

3913
07:07:58,909 --> 07:08:00,909
The guy with the fake beard

3914
07:08:01,150 --> 07:08:03,840
That's not even the real santa

3915
07:08:06,959 --> 07:08:08,080
no, but

3916
07:08:08,080 --> 07:08:10,080
to put the to long story short

3917
07:08:11,950 --> 07:08:13,950
i'd rather just have it be a

3918
07:08:14,009 --> 07:08:17,950
Interpersonal thing and not a setup thing that people have to wait in line for or

3919
07:08:18,750 --> 07:08:26,090
I mean, it's not

3920
07:08:26,090 --> 07:08:28,090
I should do a mall santa stream this year

3921
07:08:31,580 --> 07:08:32,459
No

3922
07:08:32,459 --> 07:08:38,909
Just be a mall santa

3923
07:08:38,909 --> 07:08:41,470
I don't know. I don't know if i'd want to do that. I don't like that

3924
07:08:48,750 --> 07:08:51,229
Clean your webcam. Oh, sorry. Sorry

3925

But that was awesome. Thank you

4153
07:32:04,990 --> 07:32:08,189
Sometimes I forget the things that I say and do on this stream all the time

4154
07:32:09,069 --> 07:32:11,569
That was one of those cases

4155
07:32:11,569 --> 07:32:13,490

4161
07:32:33,459 --> 07:32:35,459

Monetarily sometimes when stuff I don't even know what to say. That's this is an extreme amount of money that i'm being given

4185
07:34:54,979 --> 07:34:56,099

4186
07:34:56,099 --> 07:35:02,900

4187
07:35:03,700 --> 07:35:05,220
to this channel

4188
07:35:05,220 --> 07:35:06,990
uh

4189
07:35:06,990 --> 07:35:09,790

4190
07:35:12,500 --> 07:35:14,979
Thank you guys

4191
07:35:14,979 --> 07:35:16,979
And let's not skip over the other people here

4192
07:35:18,110 --> 07:35:21,259
as well

4193
07:35:21,259 --> 07:35:22,860
we had

4194
07:35:22,860 --> 07:35:24,380
on top of those

4195
07:35:24,380 --> 07:35:26,540
Those dump trucks full of money

4196
07:35:27,700 --> 07:35:30,360
We also had 250 from deus morta

4197
07:35:31,299 --> 07:35:35,540
Hey, buddy, here's a rough proof of concept for an emote great stream tonight. I'm excited for that carnival stream

4198
07:35:35,540 --> 07:35:37,540
It'd be cool if you went to evo some year

4199
07:35:38,099 --> 07:35:40,500
Or a meetup that week and I was gonna go to evo this year

4200
07:35:41,299 --> 07:35:42,819
It just didn't work out

4201
07:35:42,819 --> 07:35:47,860
It's not kind of too much going on

4202
07:35:47,860 --> 07:35:49,860
I will I mean there's no reason why

4203
07:35:50,500 --> 07:35:52,500
I would not be there

4204
07:35:52,659 --> 07:35:54,819
Something like next year this one

4205
07:35:55,619 --> 07:35:57,700
This is just an extended version of like this

4206
07:35:58,580 --> 07:36:01,169
that one

4207
07:36:01,169 --> 07:36:04,529
Should I just fill up four slots with this and just say who gives a shit?

4208
07:36:08,369 --> 07:36:10,450
I have so many emotes slots that i'm just not using

4209
07:36:16,259 --> 07:36:18,659
Yeah, this is just not kind of a kind of a different version of that one

4210
07:36:21,779 --> 07:36:25,299
Where'd it go? I love how I wrote this. That's so funny

4211
07:36:25,860 --> 07:36:30,740
Yeah, look at this. It's like oh I I did this

4212
07:36:39,009 --> 07:36:40,529
I hate my computer

4213
07:36:40,529 --> 07:36:45,250
I'm i'm gonna i'm going back i'm going back to like fucking imac from 1995

4214
07:36:45,889 --> 07:37:03,340
Here we go. The arm

4215
07:37:03,580 --> 07:37:05,580
The arm is like green

4216
07:37:06,380 --> 07:37:08,299
That's

4217
07:37:08,299 --> 07:37:10,299
It's from the green screen

4218
07:37:19,380 --> 07:37:22,979
I feel like there's a curtain behind me that i'm like and here's the next part of the show

4219
07:37:27,360 --> 07:37:28,479
Thank you, though

4220
07:37:28,479 --> 07:37:30,240
I'll probably add some stuff

4221
07:37:30,240 --> 07:37:37,729
Why not? I might as well

4222
07:37:37,729 --> 07:37:39,330
Back to it though

4223
07:37:39,330 --> 07:37:41,889

4224
07:37:41,970 --> 07:37:43,970

07:37:46,770 --> 07:37:50,770
It will be my first time seeing you and I don't know how it would work. I'm looking forward to meeting you

4227
07:37:51,330 --> 07:37:53,330

4228
07:37:55,139 --> 07:38:00,979

4232
07:38:20,290 --> 07:38:23,409
So that last weekend before that is the carnival stream

4233
07:38:24,049 --> 07:38:26,209
So i'm going to be pretty tired pretty busy

4234
07:38:26,770 --> 07:38:30,860
It's going to be kind of insane

4235
07:38:30,860 --> 07:38:32,860
so i'm going to be

4236
07:38:33,099 --> 07:38:36,700
Probably a little bit out of it

4237
07:38:36,700 --> 07:38:42,380
I will be there on friday and saturday, but probably not i'm not sure how much i'm going to spend on the convention floor

4238
07:38:44,080 --> 07:38:46,080
I think I will probably end up

4239
07:38:46,479 --> 07:38:49,119
Maybe a few hours at a time on the convention floor

4240
07:38:50,080 --> 07:38:51,759
I'll be like, hey, i'm

4241

In front of the smite booth or whatever does that game still exist?

4242
07:38:56,560 --> 07:38:57,840
I think it does

4243
07:38:57,840 --> 07:39:01,060
But that's how you'd be able to find me. Just keep an eye on my twitter

4244
07:39:02,270 --> 07:39:05,759
I'll say something about where I am

4245
07:39:05,759 --> 07:39:09,520

I'm gonna be honest. I had to message my bank and say yes

4274
07:41:37,979 --> 07:41:40,060
These transactions were me

4275
07:41:46,529 --> 07:41:49,409
It when your bank is starting to be like, uh, sir

They figured it out and I guess they're just they're still going

4294
07:43:11,439 --> 07:43:13,439
A shuffleboard that you just went

4295
07:43:14,290 --> 07:43:16,369
with hundreds on it

4296
07:43:16,369 --> 07:43:18,340
I feel like I just

4297
07:43:18,340 --> 07:43:23,220
I put down like 100 bucks on the roulette table and then he's like, oh you hit it. There you go

4298
07:43:26,299 --> 07:43:27,259

4299
07:43:27,259 --> 07:43:32,509
Thank you guys. Seriously

4300
07:43:33,490 --> 07:43:37,250
That means a lot. I hope you think it's worth it. I hope you can afford that

4301
07:43:38,860 --> 07:43:43,659
If please please only give to this channel, here's like where here's like money to this channel, right?

4302
07:43:43,740 --> 07:43:45,740
Like if you subscribe to the channel

4303
07:43:45,900 --> 07:43:49,099
Then thank you for subscribing and like five dollars a month. Thank you

4304
07:43:49,659 --> 07:43:55,580
But if you're if you're giving tons of money to this channel, we're talking about like here's like the scale

4305
07:43:55,900 --> 07:43:57,900
Here's the tiers of money, right?

4306
07:43:59,020 --> 07:44:01,740
I'm some I gotta put me somewhere like down here

4307
07:44:03,470 --> 07:44:10,080
Right. Take care of you. Make sure that's happening. And if it is then it is and I just want to make it really clear though

4308
07:44:10,979 --> 07:44:12,020
so

4309
07:44:12,020 --> 07:44:17,700
Take care of yourself. Take care of your friends your family your life your expenses your entertainment yourself

4310
07:44:18,740 --> 07:44:21,540
And then whatever else you have left over. That's

4311
07:44:22,340 --> 07:44:25,139
I will take it if you give it to me, you know what I mean?

4312
07:44:27,180 --> 07:44:29,500
Because sometimes people come in with a lot of money and I just

4313
07:44:30,459 --> 07:44:32,939
It's an incredibly like humbling experience to me

4314
07:44:33,500 --> 07:44:35,500
And I it's it's a lot

4315
07:44:38,500 --> 07:44:40,099
Terma wants it all

4316
07:44:40,099 --> 07:44:42,270
Whatever you got after that

4317
07:44:42,270 --> 07:44:44,099
you know

4318
07:44:44,180 --> 07:44:48,659
Myself right up here. It's like by like a peter by like a charleston shoe

4319
07:44:49,979 --> 07:44:52,380
And eat that and then and then and then me of course

4320
07:44:53,650 --> 07:44:56,689
Says the guy who only reads above the doll of bits. Yeah, but that's because

4321
07:44:57,740 --> 07:44:59,979
I mean look at how long the end of this stream has been

4322
07:45:01,790 --> 07:45:03,790
You know, the channel has grown a lot

4323
07:45:04,290 --> 07:45:06,290
since a year or two ago

4324
07:45:08,459 --> 07:45:09,659
the

4325
07:45:09,659 --> 07:45:11,979
It I was actually thinking about this the other day

4326
07:45:12,779 --> 07:45:15,020
And this is kind of the I guess we can kind of go over this

4327
07:45:15,740 --> 07:45:17,840
is

4328
07:45:17,840 --> 07:45:19,840
Once that's when the channel grows

4329
07:45:20,080 --> 07:45:25,040
I obviously want to be able to still interact with people and if people are donating at the end of the streams

4330
07:45:25,040 --> 07:45:27,680
We'll go over them, but there is a very very real

4331
07:45:28,959 --> 07:45:30,080
um

4332
07:45:30,080 --> 07:45:33,680
Scenario there are real scenarios that have to be we have to know that they exist

4333
07:45:34,319 --> 07:45:41,360
If the channel continues to grow, you know, the average viewership has grown by 60 or 50 or 60 percent in a year

4334
07:45:42,319 --> 07:45:47,279
What happens if that happens again? It might I don't know I might drop to zero. I don't know

4335
07:45:49,490 --> 07:45:50,450
but

4336
07:45:50,450 --> 07:45:55,009
I I always have to be looking at it because I don't want to have a scenario where

4337
07:45:56,459 --> 07:46:01,659
The end of the stream ends up being as long as the entire actual broadcast portion of the stream

4338
07:46:03,860 --> 07:46:05,860
I don't know. I have no idea what's going to happen

4339
07:46:06,099 --> 07:46:07,220
but

4340
07:46:07,220 --> 07:46:09,220
We always have to be kind of

4341
07:46:10,299 --> 07:46:12,319
Evaluating how that's doing and how that is

4342
07:46:13,279 --> 07:46:18,590
But I never want something like this to really disappear

4343
07:46:20,189 --> 07:46:23,709
but anyways

4344
07:46:23,709 --> 07:46:25,709
It's the end of the bits voice

4345
07:46:26,580 --> 07:46:33,939
I back before I even turned it on back before I I was actually I struggled with even turning on subs

4346
07:46:34,340 --> 07:46:36,340
And key and like I didn't want donations

4347
07:46:37,580 --> 07:46:41,740
I'd never turned on I never had paypal or anything like that donations. I didn't have it

4348
07:46:42,540 --> 07:46:47,020
I kind of I was kind of reluctant to actually have the bits and have the subs

4349
07:46:48,580 --> 07:46:51,220
But then it's also another scenario of it. Do you want to do twitch?

4350
07:46:53,069 --> 07:46:56,430
Full-time do you want to stream three or four times a week?

4351
07:46:57,630 --> 07:46:59,630
20 30 hours a week on twitch

4352
07:47:01,630 --> 07:47:04,349
Just read during a stream. I want I absolutely refuse

4353
07:47:05,549 --> 07:47:08,029
The reason why I refuse to do this because I think it ruins the broadcast

4354
07:47:09,069 --> 07:47:10,509
I think it

4355
07:47:10,509 --> 07:47:12,909
Uh, it takes away from what we're what we're doing here

4356
07:47:14,740 --> 07:47:20,900
I don't like to read anything during a stream unless of course it's something like the like this huge amount of money that's coming in

4357
07:47:20,900 --> 07:47:24,319
now

4358
07:47:24,319 --> 07:47:26,669
I find

4359
07:47:26,669 --> 07:47:28,669
We I have a goal here right like today

4360
07:47:29,389 --> 07:47:34,029
Uh, I have a goal that I want to just focus on doing this. I want to have fun. I want to

4361
07:47:35,470 --> 07:47:38,909
Be able to have all of my attention be on the thing that i'm currently streaming

4362
07:47:39,790 --> 07:47:41,950
And it's not that I don't want to

4363
07:47:42,750 --> 07:47:47,549
Say to those people that sub during the stream or say to people that give a hundred fucking dollars right now

4364
07:47:48,430 --> 07:47:50,430
We're stopping because that's a lot of money

4365
07:47:52,770 --> 07:47:57,250
Whoa, whoa the two you just too many too many subs just went on

4366
07:47:58,259 --> 07:48:02,500
Too many that was a lot that was that was 69 subs

4367
07:48:03,360 --> 07:48:04,580
69

4368
07:48:04,580 --> 07:48:06,580
Almost fucking 70 subs

4369
07:48:10,060 --> 07:48:16,459
Holy shit phylactery

4370
07:48:16,700 --> 07:48:19,500
That's a lot. That's that's too many subs

4371
07:48:20,880 --> 07:48:22,639
You should have seen

4372
07:48:22,639 --> 07:48:24,639
This dashboard over here. It almost broke

4373
07:48:25,950 --> 07:48:32,500
Holy shit

4374
07:48:32,500 --> 07:48:34,500
and not only that

4375
07:48:36,029 --> 07:48:37,389
but also

4376
07:48:37,389 --> 07:48:40,990
Vilemi gave a hundred bucks. This is just the money stream right now

4377
07:48:42,180 --> 07:48:48,180
Thank you. Vilemi. Hey jerma speaking of a thousand dollars. I'll earn my hundred thousand bit badge with this one

4378
07:48:49,040 --> 07:48:51,040
I'm sure you know what I want by now

4379
07:48:51,599 --> 07:48:54,000
Love you. Jeremy. Keep doing what you're doing and you'll go far

4380
07:48:54,799 --> 07:49:00,750
Where you want one of these?

4381
07:49:00,750 --> 07:49:02,990
Hundreds of dollars and hundreds of dollars in subs

4382
07:49:03,709 --> 07:49:09,310
He's gonna dive in his pile of bits in his vault

4383
07:49:11,119 --> 07:49:14,479
No, actually that money is going to go directly to

4384
07:49:15,819 --> 07:49:17,900
Uh, it's gonna go directly to the carnival

4385
07:49:24,319 --> 07:49:27,790
So, thank you

4386
07:49:27,790 --> 07:49:31,869
Or a casino. Yeah, I what I could I could double it. I could double it right now

4387
07:49:33,220 --> 07:49:37,060
I'll just go to the roulette table put fifteen hundred dollars on red

4388
07:49:37,860 --> 07:49:44,580
I got the shirt on

4389
07:49:44,580 --> 07:49:46,580
I would not I would never do that

4390
07:49:47,060 --> 07:49:50,099
ever

4391
07:49:50,099 --> 07:49:56,319
Never my good luck charm, but thank you phylactery. Thank you. Vilemi

4392
07:49:58,049 --> 07:50:00,479

4393
07:50:00,540 --> 07:50:02,880
Absolutely, just spoiling me just rotten

4394

Thank you

4395
07:50:04,860 --> 07:50:13,950
I hope I can use the money that you're giving me for things that

4396
07:50:14,830 --> 07:50:17,069
Can come back into the channel that maybe you think are fun

4397
07:50:19,099 --> 07:50:21,229
Thank you

4398
07:50:21,229 --> 07:50:23,069
treat yourself

4399
07:50:23,069 --> 07:50:29,569
To a McChicken later on but uh Cosmic Moses. Thanks for the five dollars, Jeremy

4400
07:50:29,569 --> 07:50:31,569
I missed the last few streams because I've been in the hospital

4401
07:50:32,209 --> 07:50:33,389
with

4402
07:50:33,389 --> 07:50:35,729
Necrotizing fasciitis or fasciltis

4403
07:50:37,119 --> 07:50:39,200
I'm not sure what that is, but hopefully you're all right

4404
07:50:39,599 --> 07:50:44,639
I'm back home, but that aging video with the up music made me sad like actually sad

4405
07:50:46,560 --> 07:50:48,799
Uh, hopefully you're hopefully you hopefully you're good

4406
07:50:51,549 --> 07:50:53,549
I'm not sure what that did that exact

4407
07:50:54,270 --> 07:50:59,939
illness is

4408
07:50:59,939 --> 07:51:06,349
But no, don't worry about me that aging video. It's just it's just it was just a little joke

4409
07:51:07,659 --> 07:51:14,959
You know, but for you

4410
07:51:15,580 --> 07:51:17,740
hopefully, um

4411
07:51:17,740 --> 07:51:21,500
Hopefully you get you can get that squared away. I'm not sure what that uh entails but

4412
07:51:23,150 --> 07:51:25,150
Uh much love to you. Hopefully that

4413
07:51:26,979 --> 07:51:28,979
You got the right doctors on the case there

4414
07:51:31,459 --> 07:51:33,459
Keep your head up. That's right

4415
07:51:38,020 --> 07:51:40,900
Hey, I gave 10 bits and my badge didn't update I feel robbed

4416
07:51:42,639 --> 07:51:44,639
Is it decayed? Is there a badge for 10?

4417
07:51:47,229 --> 07:51:48,830
My mouth is covered

4418
07:51:48,830 --> 07:51:50,189
Oh

4419
07:51:50,189 --> 07:51:52,189
Because I keep dropping this thing into the ground

4420
07:51:54,560 --> 07:51:56,560
By the way, this really does look like you're looking

4421
07:51:57,520 --> 07:52:00,720
Through to my stream through a dirty bathroom mirror

4422
07:52:09,180 --> 07:52:11,180
Uh, but thank you Cosmic Moses

4423
07:52:11,180 --> 07:52:14,000
Uh get well soon

4424
07:52:14,000 --> 07:52:17,549
Thank you so much for the five dollars

4425
07:52:17,549 --> 07:52:20,590
Fus ro boto. Thanks for the 10 bucks. Hey, there was a glitch in the bit system

4426
07:52:20,669 --> 07:52:25,950
So don't believe the amount that it says there is this is 100 million bits

4427
07:52:27,619 --> 07:52:34,259
Uh, that would be a lot. That would be at least that would be at least 200 dollars. I can't do the math in my head quickly

4428
07:52:35,139 --> 07:52:41,220
That's Italy. That's like 50 100 dollars or something. It's a lot

4429
07:52:42,020 --> 07:52:45,020
Thanks for the 10 bucks though. Fus ro boto

4430
07:52:45,659 --> 07:52:50,380
Peanut gangster. Thanks for 250. You think at this point your viewers have covered the cost of the next germa rumble live action

4431
07:52:51,500 --> 07:52:55,310
um

4432
07:52:55,310 --> 07:52:57,310
One at a time, you know one by one

4433
07:52:58,860 --> 07:53:01,500
I have to one thing that I do have to be careful of is

4434
07:53:02,299 --> 07:53:05,900
Because I am financing all these things by myself

4435
07:53:06,700 --> 07:53:08,220
I'm not getting any

4436
07:53:08,220 --> 07:53:12,939
Money from any other entity, right? It's just like the money that I get from twitch

4437
07:53:13,819 --> 07:53:18,139
Is this money that i'm using right? But I do have to be careful and I don't really ever want

4438
07:53:19,180 --> 07:53:21,180
any um

4439
07:53:21,180 --> 07:53:27,740
Outside sponsorships i've talked about it before with people at twitch and people that are involved in this particular project

4440
07:53:29,650 --> 07:53:31,970
It's it kind of it muddies it a little

4441
07:53:34,340 --> 07:53:35,860
What about fruit?

4442
07:53:35,860 --> 07:53:37,860
I lost that sponsorship

4443
07:53:39,520 --> 07:53:43,599
I hate I hate a bag of combos on camera and they ditched me

4444
07:53:44,400 --> 07:53:50,159
Like what ate a bag of combos? Yeah, they'll 645 calories a bag and then made it a processed fake cheese

4445
07:53:51,439 --> 07:53:52,720
What's the problem?

4446
07:53:52,720 --> 07:54:08,060
Whatever get a basket robin sponsorship. No, how much money did I get from the door cube?

4447
07:54:08,779 --> 07:54:12,540
Uh, I hadn't I had an affiliate code with door cube and it was used three times

4448
07:54:13,580 --> 07:54:16,700
so I made um

4449
07:54:16,700 --> 07:54:22,479
14 cents

4450
07:54:22,479 --> 07:54:28,799
nine cents after taxes

4451
07:54:28,799 --> 07:54:33,439
Hey pigeon. Thanks for the 250 because I had to donate for you to answer it

4452
07:54:34,380 --> 07:54:38,060
Oh, I see. I see. I see that's what they're not like this before. Okay

4453
07:54:38,779 --> 07:54:41,009
I'll be a twitch con though

4454
07:54:41,009 --> 07:54:44,240
You'll see me. You will see me at twitchcon

4455
07:54:47,340 --> 07:54:51,759
Gonder lane. Thanks for the 250. Will you ever come back to the east coast? We miss you cox is no good

So come back to your comfy boston basement where you grew famous

4457
07:54:56,849 --> 07:55:00,849
Well, um fiber is being laid all over vegas right now

4458
07:55:01,409 --> 07:55:05,650
So I will have fiber over the next I will be on a fiber optic network

4459
07:55:07,299 --> 07:55:10,580
in

4460
07:55:10,580 --> 07:55:15,459
Three four months maybe it depends either late 2019 or early 2020

4461
07:55:17,200 --> 07:55:21,680
I will have a one thousand one thousand symmetrical fiber line

4462
07:55:23,200 --> 07:55:24,959
before

4463
07:55:24,959 --> 07:55:29,599
My 35th birthday way before that like six months tops

4464
07:55:32,689 --> 07:55:34,689
And the thing with fiber is it's not coax

4465
07:55:35,090 --> 07:55:39,169
So all this bullshit all these problems that all these awful internet issues

4466
07:55:39,810 --> 07:55:41,810
Do not exist on fiber

4467
07:55:42,130 --> 07:55:43,490
There is no

4468
07:55:43,490 --> 07:55:47,409
Oh somebody turned on their microwave and kicked everybody off the network

4469
07:55:47,970 --> 07:55:52,770
Somebody had an unscrewed cable coax that there's no noise ingress like that with fiber

4470
07:55:52,849 --> 07:55:55,700
So

4471
07:55:55,700 --> 07:56:01,139
And I say that now but it's gonna be a thousand upload. I have 30 up right now. It's going to be one

4472
07:56:01,919 --> 07:56:04,500
Thousand through a fiber optic line

4473
07:56:05,540 --> 07:56:08,740
It would be I would just be cursed. It would be me

4474
07:56:08,819 --> 07:56:12,900
The problem would be me at that point if I cannot have a stable connection with fiber

4475
07:56:13,540 --> 07:56:16,500
A thousand fucking upload then it's me

4476
07:56:18,380 --> 07:56:20,419
It has to be

4477
07:56:20,419 --> 07:56:22,419
When's the carnival stream september 21st?

4478
07:56:24,180 --> 07:56:34,000
Somewhere in the early afternoon eastern time, but no I have no plans on moving back to the east coast

4479
07:56:34,080 --> 07:56:36,080
I'll be on the west coast for at least

4480
07:56:37,490 --> 07:56:39,490
Whether it's somewhere in vegas

4481
07:56:40,130 --> 07:56:42,130
over the night over the years or

4482
07:56:42,939 --> 07:56:44,939
I don't know. I want to be on the west coast

4483
07:56:45,099 --> 07:56:47,970
I'll be in vegas for a while though. That's for certain

4484
07:56:48,610 --> 07:56:57,540
That random guy cursed me. Yeah, I didn't buy the I gotta buy that fiber curse removal. You're right

4485
07:57:03,520 --> 07:57:07,220
fiber

4486
07:57:07,220 --> 07:57:09,220
We also had

4487
07:57:12,099 --> 07:57:15,479
All that money came in the 69 subs from phylactery

4488
07:57:16,849 --> 07:57:18,849
three dollars from cyan tf2

4489
07:57:19,330 --> 07:57:23,409
Holy shit. This man gave 500 bits. That's insane

4490
07:57:24,560 --> 07:57:26,560
If you decide to give me a cent

4491
07:57:27,500 --> 07:57:29,979
Then it's as appreciated as anything else

4492
07:57:30,779 --> 07:57:32,779
If you decide to give this channel any money

4493
07:57:33,340 --> 07:57:36,299
It's not just a thousand dollars of somebody donating

4494
07:57:37,500 --> 07:57:43,580
Or supporting subs too, there's a lot of consistent subs on this channel more than I ever could have possibly imagined

4495
07:57:44,380 --> 07:57:46,299
so it's not just

4496
07:57:46,299 --> 07:57:50,779
The people dropping the 500 bucks as much as that's amazing and insane for me

4497
07:57:52,299 --> 07:57:58,459
It's not just that so don't feel like oh shit. I only gave three dollars today. Fuck

4498
07:57:58,860 --> 07:58:02,459
No, that's I don't that I do not feel that that's I do not feel that way

4499
07:58:02,459 --> 07:58:03,900
Okay

4500
07:58:03,900 --> 07:58:07,389
There's no cent equivalent of a bit. I think it's 25 cents minimum, right?

4501
07:58:08,270 --> 07:58:11,310
Has to prevent people from just doing one cent spam with the thing

4502
07:58:12,189 --> 07:58:14,590
Right, so you could just have the chat be filled with the symbol

4503
07:58:17,779 --> 07:58:20,900
And speaking of subs, there's another five from kazi

4504
07:58:22,340 --> 07:58:28,349
Kazi 101 five community subs. Thank you. Kazi five more subs from the subway

4505
07:58:29,650 --> 07:58:32,479
No, for real. You guys are too good

4506
07:58:33,119 --> 07:58:35,409
You guys are too good to me

4507
07:58:35,409 --> 07:58:39,650
Just glad you still think that it's fun to be in the channel and i'm glad you still this many years later

4508
07:58:39,650 --> 07:58:44,159
I've been doing this for a long time

4509
07:58:44,159 --> 07:58:47,919
A lot of times when people do this kind of shit for a long fucking time

4510
07:58:48,799 --> 07:58:50,799
You know, wow, it's

4511
07:58:50,959 --> 07:58:58,240
Hey, here we go. What? Well, I started youtube um eight plus years ago. Whoa, this is a roller coaster

4512
07:58:58,639 --> 07:59:00,560
This is so cool

4513
07:59:00,560 --> 07:59:03,759
Five years six years. Oh, okay. I have seven years. Uh

4514
07:59:04,799 --> 07:59:09,360
This is you I you guys are still fucking doing this you guys are still going

4515
07:59:10,459 --> 07:59:12,459
and I don't know I i'm

4516
07:59:15,150 --> 07:59:17,869
Shocked that i've still been able to do this

4517
07:59:22,990 --> 07:59:24,990
It's been a long fucking time

4518
07:59:25,939 --> 07:59:28,340
So take things like the carnival stream

4519
07:59:29,139 --> 07:59:35,220
As my way of the kind of saying thank you and hopefully then we can make have a fun time. It doesn't matter

4520
07:59:35,860 --> 07:59:37,299
If that stream

4521
07:59:37,299 --> 07:59:40,259
Is oh how much was that stream expensive who gives a shit?

4522
07:59:41,389 --> 07:59:44,450
Who gives a shit?

4523
07:59:44,450 --> 07:59:46,900
You know what I mean?

4524
07:59:46,900 --> 07:59:52,849
It's it's worth doing

4525
07:59:52,849 --> 07:59:56,689
I mean that

4526
07:59:56,689 --> 07:59:58,610
He's getting better with age

4527
07:59:58,610 --> 08:00:02,400
We'll see

4528
08:00:02,400 --> 08:00:04,400
But we're reaching the end here

4529
08:00:04,959 --> 08:00:07,840
we had a phylactery lich gave five dollars

4530
08:00:08,880 --> 08:00:11,380
and they say

4531
08:00:11,380 --> 08:00:14,500
Seriously, I give all these bits and subs because you're my primary entertainment

4532
08:00:14,819 --> 08:00:19,459
And I never want to stop watching your funny ass streams involved 69 subs was for the meme

4533
08:00:19,540 --> 08:00:23,939
But next time i'll do 420 not tonight though because we're about to leave

4534
08:00:25,700 --> 08:00:27,060
4

4535
08:00:27,060 --> 08:00:28,740
420

4536
08:00:28,740 --> 08:00:30,159
sub

4537
08:00:30,159 --> 08:00:35,680
I think that's we're not doing that tonight though. Hold on to that one

4538
08:00:36,240 --> 08:00:39,040
Because that's fucking like thousands of dollars

4539
08:00:41,419 --> 08:00:45,099
Thank you, though. I really appreciate that. I'm humbled to be your primary entertainment

4540
08:00:47,759 --> 08:00:50,400
That would like kill the chat it would be like

4541
08:00:51,439 --> 08:00:53,439
It would just be flying by

4542
08:00:56,130 --> 08:00:57,409
But thank you

4543
08:00:57,409 --> 08:00:59,619
I really appreciate it

4544
08:00:59,619 --> 08:01:05,299
Pigeon, thank you for the 250 and the 250 right on top of it. How the hell do you how the hell do you do your budget?

4545
08:01:05,840 --> 08:01:07,380
thankfully

4546
08:01:07,380 --> 08:01:11,459
Uh, there's other people involved that can help with that if you talk about the carnival thing

4547
08:01:12,340 --> 08:01:14,340
I have things that I specifically want

4548
08:01:15,419 --> 08:01:22,299
That there are two companies involved. So I have told that we on paper and I spent we I spent a long time

4549
08:01:22,619 --> 08:01:24,860
On this remember I told you i've been dialing streams back

4550
08:01:25,819 --> 08:01:28,220
My streams have been

4551
08:01:28,220 --> 08:01:30,860
Instead of three or four times a week. It's like two or three times a week now

4552
08:01:33,680 --> 08:01:39,759
And I obviously want to stay by the book twitch actually keeps a really good track of what's coming out and coming in

4553
08:01:40,159 --> 08:01:45,919
So it's not just oh i have to go through this and see if they they keep it a pretty good track of it. So

4554
08:01:47,360 --> 08:01:53,819
That voice thing. Yeah, that's

4555
08:01:54,779 --> 08:01:57,099
That's old news

4556
08:01:57,099 --> 08:01:59,099
And it's fucking still sounds good

4557
08:01:59,340 --> 08:02:07,819
It still sounds fucking just as good as it did when I made it fucking 12 15 years ago

4558
08:02:12,080 --> 08:02:16,509
Yeah, it was like that's like more than 10 15 years old

4559
08:02:17,680 --> 08:02:19,520
And I still got it

4560
08:02:19,520 --> 08:02:25,790
Was that before I played tf2? That was that was like before I went to college

4561
08:02:28,849 --> 08:02:30,450
That was a long time ago

4562
08:02:30,450 --> 08:02:41,740
Why does the profile say that you're a teenager adult male senior male and old male? No, that's like what i'm capable of

4563
08:02:42,860 --> 08:02:45,459
That's what i'm capable of

4564
08:02:45,459 --> 08:02:48,259
That's what i'm capable of that's what i'm capable of

4565
08:02:48,900 --> 08:02:53,939
That is what i'm capable of and if you don't think that that was every entire spectrum of age

4566
08:03:00,979 --> 08:03:03,540
It was anyways guys

4567
08:03:06,130 --> 08:03:11,650
That's all the voices. He has that's not true. I got like second. I have like at least five or six of us

4568
08:03:12,130 --> 08:03:16,610
I got at least 10 voices 12

4569
08:03:19,389 --> 08:03:21,389
Uh, that's going to be the time here

4570
08:03:21,709 --> 08:03:23,709
I did not expect this to be an eight-hour stream, but it is

4571
08:03:24,770 --> 08:03:29,970
We've done some long ones recently. This is another long one. I'm going to see what star is up to tomorrow

4572
08:03:31,069 --> 08:03:35,310
And maybe there'll be terraria tomorrow if his computer is working. That was a problem before

4573
08:03:36,540 --> 08:03:39,500
I'm gonna go take a shower. I'm gonna get some food and i'm gonna get some rest

4574
08:03:39,979 --> 08:03:44,380
Thank you everybody. Thank you for fucking joining me. Hope you enjoyed this stream. I had a blast playing

4575
08:03:45,259 --> 08:03:47,259
It was definitely worth playing for sure

4576
08:03:48,529 --> 08:03:51,330
Right at the very end. Oh, I could do the outro screen. Come on

4577
08:03:52,830 --> 08:03:55,869
Uh dia beats. Thanks for the three dollars germa

4578
08:03:55,869 --> 08:03:57,630
Thanks for all the content you provide over the years

4579
08:03:57,630 --> 08:04:01,069
I feel like I can speak with the whole chat here when I say you've done wonders through this site

4580
08:04:01,630 --> 08:04:05,869
Sorry for the internet problems that really sucks. Nonetheless, we'll be here through it all

4581
08:04:08,500 --> 08:04:16,319
Thank you the internet is just in the united states

4582
08:04:16,939 --> 08:04:20,799
Unfortunately, you kind of just throw dice in the air if you're going to have a good stable upload connection

4583
08:04:20,880 --> 08:04:22,880
That's just the way it works. It's like that everywhere

4584
08:04:24,000 --> 08:04:27,200
Some people don't have a problem at all. Some people have more problems than they can

4585
08:04:27,759 --> 08:04:29,759
Deal with and it sucks

4586
08:04:30,479 --> 08:04:36,099
Because having unstable internet, it's one thing dropping like a thousand two thousand frames of stream is pretty normal

4587
08:04:37,619 --> 08:04:41,340
But thank you

4588
08:04:41,340 --> 08:04:46,369
And finally garfy the monday killer germ the worm. You didn't click on garf's links. Oh shit in the other right?

4589
08:04:46,369 --> 08:04:47,810
Yeah, you already did

4590
08:04:47,810 --> 08:04:50,130
Garf doesn't come around out of retirement very often

4591
08:04:50,849 --> 08:04:53,889
Uh garf made a more palatable trailer exclusive to you

4592
08:04:55,759 --> 08:04:56,799
All right

4593
08:04:56,799 --> 08:05:04,290
The film allows live action bits and we'd love to have you on board the crew since you're recruiting since we're recruiting youtubers

4594
08:05:05,009 --> 08:05:07,810
Consider this a pitch to you in a trailer for the audience

4595
08:05:09,090 --> 08:05:10,529
Here we go

4596
08:05:10,610 --> 08:05:28,270
It's a trailer

4597
08:05:28,270 --> 08:05:30,270
Are you like a clown costume?

4598
08:05:49,889 --> 08:05:56,610
Worry about it. He was here last night. He forced me to put on these clothes and then flew away without saying anything

4599
08:05:57,409 --> 08:05:59,409
I'm fine. It's fine

4600
08:06:00,130 --> 08:06:04,029
I'm fine

4601
08:06:11,740 --> 08:06:14,560
It's funny

4602
08:06:20,139 --> 08:06:21,419
It's over

4603
08:06:21,419 --> 08:06:35,279
That was pretty great. Actually

4604
08:06:35,279 --> 08:06:37,169
Thank you garfield

4605
08:06:37,169 --> 08:06:39,500
Uh, good luck to you

4606
08:06:39,500 --> 08:06:42,860
If I have time, maybe I would throw in a few lines or something

4607
08:06:43,340 --> 08:06:46,639
The only problem is i'm not going to have very much time until after september

4608
08:06:48,930 --> 08:06:51,490
Because of these a couple of streams, especially the carnival

4609
08:06:53,810 --> 08:06:58,479
Looked really interesting though

4610
08:06:59,919 --> 08:07:01,919
Pigeon thanks for the 250

4611
08:07:03,069 --> 08:07:05,150
Derma, I keep fucking up my bits

4612
08:07:08,799 --> 08:07:11,119
I keep fucking up my bits

4613
08:07:11,919 --> 08:07:13,360
uh

4614
08:07:13,360 --> 08:07:15,360
Ha lulu drew this

4615
08:07:16,930 --> 08:07:19,330
Another fucking awesome piece of artwork

4616
08:07:21,180 --> 08:07:25,360
This is awesome

4617
08:07:25,360 --> 08:07:27,759
Oh, no, he said the f-word. Oh, no, he said the f-word

4618
08:07:28,319 --> 08:07:38,590
Look at those eyes

4619
08:07:38,590 --> 08:07:42,240
I feel like I could swim in those eyes. They're like pools

4620
08:07:46,319 --> 08:07:51,630
shiny glistening eyes

4621
08:07:51,630 --> 08:07:56,270
Thank you. Uh, ha lulu and thank you pigeon for bringing it to my attention

4622
08:07:56,909 --> 08:08:01,009
This is great

4623
08:08:01,009 --> 08:08:03,099
Complimenting yourself

4624
08:08:03,099 --> 08:08:05,099
No, i'm complimenting a picture

4625
08:08:05,580 --> 08:08:07,580

Uh, it's not me. That's that's a that's a picture that was drone of me

4627
08:08:16,349 --> 08:08:21,419
Nice work for real

4628
08:08:21,419 --> 08:08:23,700

I will see you guys all tomorrow

4630
08:08:26,700 --> 08:08:28,700
Whatever it is we do we do

4631
08:08:29,790 --> 08:08:31,790
I have not decided yet. There are plenty of options

4632
08:08:33,090 --> 08:08:37,569
Have a fantastic rest of your night. It's still fairly early for some of us

4633
08:08:39,150 --> 08:08:41,150
Take care. See you tomorrow

4634
08:08:41,229 --> 08:08:44,340
And I forgot the fucking credits. No, I didn't

4635
08:08:44,900 --> 08:08:55,069
Here we go. Here they come

4636
08:08:55,889 --> 08:09:05,119
It's gonna be a lot considering the 100 plus community subs that came through here. Oh, man

4637
08:09:09,200 --> 08:09:16,189
Where do you recommend games? Uh, go to the discord. There's a channel in the discord that is for recommendations specifically

4638
08:09:16,990 --> 08:09:18,990
I check it probably once a week

4639
08:09:23,619 --> 08:09:25,619
This is potentially hundreds of subs here

4640
08:09:30,779 --> 08:09:33,340
Read them out loud. I can't there's too many

4641
08:09:35,380 --> 08:09:37,380
But where do we demand games?

4642
08:09:37,459 --> 08:09:43,000
Uh to to my face and then i'll tell you I don't I I don't get demanded I get recommended

4643
08:09:52,560 --> 08:09:56,000
Play battle for bikini bottom when it gets a remaster. They're remastering that game

4644
08:10:01,409 --> 08:10:06,900
Avery dropped dead. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey, I also fucked up my bits

4645

4647
08:10:26,380 --> 08:10:31,889
Is it uh, is it beagle? Yeah

4648
08:10:31,889 --> 08:10:38,240
Look at this dog. I want to put it behind the credits

4649
08:10:41,220 --> 08:10:45,439
Look at this dog

4650
08:10:45,439 --> 08:10:51,069
Sleepy dog. I have to do that voice whenever I see a dog. It's important

4651
08:10:56,110 --> 08:10:58,110
He's got a special plank

4652
08:11:04,750 --> 08:11:06,799
No, thank you

4653
08:11:06,799 --> 08:11:15,119
Dog looks comfy

4654
08:11:15,119 --> 08:11:17,919
I do cutesy. I think you have to do a cutesy voice at an animal

4655
08:11:18,930 --> 08:11:21,970
It could be a dog. It could be a squirrel. I do that shit to lizards

4656
08:11:28,669 --> 08:11:30,110

Birds, I want a bird

4663
08:11:56,580 --> 08:12:02,020
I want one of those big ass birds, but they're really loud. Aren't they? I wouldn't be able to stream

4664
08:12:06,529 --> 08:12:08,930
If I had a huge bird back here, wouldn't it just be like?

4665
08:12:11,939 --> 08:12:20,060
All day

4666
08:12:20,060 --> 08:12:22,060
That's a vulture. Well, you know what I mean?

4667
08:12:29,150 --> 08:12:31,520
All right guys

4668
08:12:31,520 --> 08:12:34,860
