1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:19,100
Hi. Wait, what was that? Am I drowning in the game? No, I'm not. Wait, am I dead? How did I die?

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:27,350
Oh, I drowned. All right, well, that's all right. I didn't have anything. I just turned it on. I was

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:39,399
just testing it. Get the intro back on. I'm not here. You don't see me yet. I'll be right back.

4
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:22,340
Okay. Hello, everybody. I'm back. Another day. Another stream. Today, but the surprise is ruined,

5
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,689
even though if you were there last night, you knew. We're gonna play VR. Back in it again.

6
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:41,209
We're gonna start with Minecraft VR. That actually hurt to say that. It's already set up.

7
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:47,609
Apparently, I didn't know this before setting it all up. Look at my outfit today. I'm super

8
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:57,560
springy today. I'm like really summery today. Look at this. I got my fucking beach outfit on.

9
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:11,240
Don't you think? Like these? I do. I got that wave. I got a haircut too. What do you think?

10
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:18,340
Didn't get styled. I shaved. I was ready for you guys tonight. I was ready to do VR.

11
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:29,719
The wave? What's this called? This called something. The wave shirt. No, no, no. What's

12
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:46,199
the shirt called? I look like Ric Flair. I'll take it. I'll fucking take it. I'm pumped up today.

13
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:56,569
Not even at all, actually. I'm kind of tired. But let's go. I'm just wasting time.

14
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:02,409
Hope you all had a good day today. After today, you're not gonna see me for a few days.

15
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,020
So I figured I might as well do some Minecraft VR. Is this the right hand?

16
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:21,879
Before I strap these up, let me. Also, by the way, boring. What's it got in the wine glass?

17
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:32,699
Water? Boring. I can't drink in there. I'll fucking die. All right, let's go.

18
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:40,020
I'm gonna get this over with. Somebody has given like 20 community subs with the name

19
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,800
Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. You have to change your name now. This is the stream

20
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,610
where you change your name. You all thought I was a liar. You thought I wasn't gonna do it.

21
00:03:52,009 --> 00:04:00,969
Here we are. I don't really know how to play in VR, though. So it should be, uh,

22
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,909
it should be interesting for all of us. This is all untangled. We're all good to go.

23
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,330
Did you see my fucking summer outfit? I didn't even get any compliments.

24
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:21,189
We're already tangled. No, we're not. Yeah, that's fine. All right, going in.

25
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:36,620
This shirt probably has sweat stains. It's worn to bed quite frequently. I'm gonna

26
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:47,160
unmute the game too. Don't worry. All right, there we go. So we are in Minecraft now.

27
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,399
So what was it? One hour, right? I said I'm gonna play this for one hour

28
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,160
and then uninstall the game. I told her I was gonna just dig down until I find

29
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:12,410
diamonds and I'm uninstalling again. Which one is right? Which one's left?

30
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:24,579
This is kind of cool. He went, he came under water to do this?

31
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:34,089
Okay. This is actually really interesting. I don't want the full experience. Not yet.

32
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:39,670
What happened down there? All right, this is the right hand.

33
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,589
Because I had to, because the left hand has HUD info on it. See this? There you guys are.

34
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:52,490
Because there's no HUD info. I know this is the right hand. You're gonna drown? I'm already

35
00:05:52,490 --> 00:06:00,569
dead. I already died. It's weird seeing the game like this though. This is kind of strange.

36
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:11,449
The blocks look huge. Destroy the tree. Hold on. So we're gonna have to get

37
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,850
the whole tutorial here. I know how to play Minecraft, but it's been

38
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,250
fucking, and the last time I played it doesn't count because I was shit faced.

39
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:40,300
All right, here we go. So how do I respawn? How do I spawn? Did I get softlocked?

40
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:55,399
Oh, the game window might not be in focus. It's, wow, you're right, it's not. There we go.

41
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:12,339
All right, respawn. Here we go. I hate this already. Okay, so that's inventory. How do I

42
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:24,040
walk? Okay, it's left trigger to walk. It looks like you go towards anywhere you're looking.

43
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,819
Destroy the tree. Hold down left button. Okay, how do I get this tutorial out of here? I know

44
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,300
what I'm doing. Wait, what are you doing? What are you doing when you first start Minecraft?

45
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:57,379
This is, I hate this. I feel like I'm tuning a TV. Whoa, all right. So you automatically

46
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:08,620
just go up. All right, sick. Let's go. How far is the breach? All right, I gotta stop fucking around.

47
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,379
Wood, right? Okay, I got this. How do I place blocks? Okay, it's this button here.

48
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:22,459
Then you can take them away by hitting them again. All right, so say the lines. Not until

49
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:29,240
I know what I'm doing. Plus that wasn't part of the deal. Oh, destroy the tree. I know.

50
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:41,139
This takes too long. All right, where's my inventory? Right over here. All right, so you

51
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:52,379
can slide. No, they're actually not bad controls. So take the whole tree down.

52
00:08:53,019 --> 00:09:00,379
How do you make torches? It's light and charcoal, right? How do you, what is it? It's,

53
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,820
how do you make a torch? It's charcoal and wood stove? All right, I got enough wood.

54
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:32,340
Light, yes, yes. Just harvest some light. Press E. What's E? Well, that's how you,

55
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:41,529
that's how you throw. No, that's, that's a menu. What is E? Top left button? Yeah,

56
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:54,100
that's what I just pressed. One of the grips, maybe? What is E? Just press E. I can't just,

57
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:16,039
there's no E on my hand. Where'd that go? Press E. Didn't I just do it? Ah, okay,

58
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,440
wait, wait, wait. Okay, so hold on here. It's up. You have to press up. What's down?

59
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,830
Let's just get the buttons ready. Down is jump. What is right? Okay, everything, it's,

60
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:33,720
okay, I got it. I got E. There's the crafting menu. So this is your click to open key showing off.

61
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,399
And this is, I make, oh, well, this is a lot different than what I remember.

62
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:51,460
Then, okay, so you just put it up here and then take them. He got it. Okay, then you do

63
00:10:52,340 --> 00:11:01,659
sticks and then I need to make a tool, right? That's enough tools. So crafting,

64
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:08,899
I need to make a workbench. That's this, right? How do I split them? How do you split?

65
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:19,769
There it is. Crafting bench. All right. And then let me just make a little shitty fucking

66
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,980
house first. Just hold on. Get out of the menu. I got to make a house. Right on the

67
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:45,700
beach. Perfect. What do you think? Hell yeah. I'm so ready for a 24-hour stream here. It's

68
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:54,970
not going to be 24 hours. Good thing you have your beach outfit on. Yeah. All right,

69
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:01,340
so I'm thinking a long dock here and then the house. I don't want to, no, actually live

70
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,000
on a beach is fine. I need a shovel. This is very overwhelming. So just put the fucking

71
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,950
crafting bench down. Who cares? Not like that. Go get it. So crafting bench, just put it over

72
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:24,789
there. I'll open it up. So does this count that I'm like standing near it? Okay, there

73
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:32,519
it is. Let's get it all in there. I got pickaxe. Let's get a, wow. Does it actually

74
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,190
work? Does this work? That's actually really cool. I don't know if you can actually hit

75
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:50,200
stuff with this. Okay, shovel. That's important. All right, now let's go get what we need.

76
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,919
Forget about all the, I don't know, I'm not going to do any of this shit. I'll be

77
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,879
lucky if I play this for more than 30 minutes. Well, it was supposed to be an

78
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:20,970
hour, but you get it. You understand. You can hit. No shit. No fucking way. That's

79
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:34,870
too much for anybody's brain. No, I was going to do it like this. That's too much.

80
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:43,740
I don't want to do it like that. Let's get this place cleaned up. I don't need that

81
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,899
big of a house. I do have to, I gotta go down. Uh, there's a basement right here

82
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:59,139
with this water. Uh, this way. Let's go over here. There's stone. All right, my

83
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:19,340
house is over there. Is water gonna get in here? I need, I need coal. Check

84
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,419
your recipe book. I know. What about over here? Where the fuck am I? I don't

85
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:31,220
want to be on this waterfront. I need to get coal. I'm just going to go straight

86
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:47,750
down here. I will say this is probably the the coolest way you could play

87
00:14:47,750 --> 00:15:02,950
Minecraft. All right, you see coal? It's getting dark out. I need coal right

88
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:16,360
now. Okay, you can burn wood too, can't you? Stone axe. I know. I don't have a

89
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:29,690
weapon. How long is the day night cycle? I'm actually fucking getting scared

90
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:52,889
though. This actually is scary. There's a creeper over there. All right,

91
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,940
I gotta go burn wood. Is that what you, I gotta burn wood, right? Where's my

92
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:19,909
house? Over here. Okay, at night this is a much different game. Who cares if I

93
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:26,730
die? There we go, right here. I need to make a, uh, furnace, right? But this is

94
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,220
gonna be the house. Might as well. Is that a creeper face right there?

95
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,350
That's a creeper just staring at me, right? It's coming at once. That's

96
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:47,500
a, that's a wart creeper. Must have been added in the fucking 1.2 update.

97
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:57,990
All right, let's see here. I need, that's not a furnace? That's not a

98
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:13,609
furnace. How is that not a furnace? It's eight in a, isn't this a crafting

99
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:20,460
bench though? Am I, is something, what's going on here? Am I in the crafting

100
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:50,059
menu? This is the crafting table, isn't it? That's not the, I haven't

101
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,500
played Minecraft, actually for real, without being drunk in like four years.

102
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,789
It's the crafting table. Isn't, that's not what this is. This is not a

103
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:33,190
crafting table. I just was trying to open this. What the fuck? Is that,

104
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:41,059
is this gravel? God damn it. Just give it back. Give it, just, just get

105
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:47,130
it, just, just get out. It's kind of awkward, the commerce, the, the,

106
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:54,470
it's kind of awkward menus. All right, so, put this down. This is,

107
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:01,059
don't take it either. All right, move over here. So, I gotta put some

108
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:09,980
wood in here. Does that count? No. Charcoal, I can't just put, like,

109
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:13,579
I can't put like a tree in there. It's gotta be like a block of wood,

110
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:21,740
right? No, I don't even have an axe. I need a regular fucking bench,

111
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,400
like a storage unit or something. There's something fucking here.

112
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,619
So, left button is, it's up here, it's odd, because every other place

113
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:50,970
you press is jump. This is place. It's hard to see. It's like a

114
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,769
tint, it's like hard to see it from here. Remember, I'm working with

115
00:19:53,769 --> 00:20:03,160
like half the resolution that you guys are seeing. Let's just start

116
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:10,279
making a fucking house. All right, here we go. Whatever the fucking,

117
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,839
that's way too many creepers. That's a joke. I'm getting stream sniped

118
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,309
by like seven creepers over here. You knew I was going to be

119
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:28,150
streaming over here. Are you fucking serious? There was at least

120
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:43,960
five or six right there. No joke. All right, let's go. How do I

121
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,809
sneak? Not like that. I don't give a shit. I can fix it later.

122
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,599
Uh, the ceilings are way too high. I don't know how to sneak

123
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,799
like on this controller. You don't know how to sneak? You're

124
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:08,059
just crouching in real life. That's a lie. That's not how you

125
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:14,470
do it. Close your closet. I can't do that right now.

126
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:32,230
Let's just, I gotta go over here. Everybody starts with a

127
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:44,630
dirt house for shelter. I gotta come out here a little.

128
00:21:44,630 --> 00:22:00,140
I'm close to something. What are you doing? One more? Look at

129
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:14,019
that. Okay, now. What am I near? Only non-pro gamers use

130
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:24,839
dirt. The desk is over here. That's a new monster. How do I

131
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:43,559
take care of this monster? Why is he faster in water?

132
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,579
Monster hunter. All right, get the fuck out of here. Hurry

133
00:22:53,579 --> 00:23:01,700
up. Climb back up. Sun's coming up. The monsters are

134
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,779
huge. I guess you are just the same size, right? All

135
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:09,480
right, where was I? I gotta find something to light the

136
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:28,779
house with. Alright, that's fine. I just need a wall over

137
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,220
here. Anybody know how to sneak? Turn on the music.

138
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,130
Music is on. Change your scale above 100%. I actually

139
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:49,259
like it like this though. Alright, there we go. That's

140
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:53,779
all I need then. Just this way. And this is it. Then

141
00:23:53,779 --> 00:24:00,579
I'm gonna build the roof. I got two. I think it's

142
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:14,539
coming along alright. That looks fine. This is just a

143
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:18,460
placeholder until like, okay, I gotta go on a search. I

144
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,900
gotta go on an adventure for diamonds. Not diamonds, fuck.

145
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:32,059
Stone. Home sweet home. Hello ladies and gentlemen,

146
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:36,859
welcome to episode one of Turbocraft, the series where

147
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,380
I play Minecraft. And if you can get yourself into a

148
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,500
nice seated comfortable position, hands inside the ride

149
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,059
at all times, we're gonna make our way over down

150
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,539
there. I think that way. Maybe there's some diamonds

151
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:53,259
over there. I got myself a I got a cider. I hope you got

152
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,700
one too. That's good. And there you go. There's there's

153
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,930
the clip that I will see posted to my channel 5000

154
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:10,630
times a week until the day I'm dead. At my funeral,

155
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:13,589
one of you guys is gonna show up and fucking put

156
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:24,599
that on like a tablet and place it on the casket. We

157
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,680
need a comparison. Alright, first of all, lambs. I'll

158
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:47,700
take one. I was just fucking fell over. I need that.

159
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,869
Alright, I got the meat. Am I not supposed to be doing

160
00:25:50,869 --> 00:26:16,630
this? Get this fucking break it with your hands. No,

161
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,099
kids are gonna love this. I'm serious. Kids are gonna

162
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:27,539
love this. I didn't kids play this yet. Alright, what

163
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,920
was I doing? Okay, I got wool. I can make a bed now.

164
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,619
Now, I just need three pieces of wood. How about this

165
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:48,059
one? Looks good to me. This is a different kind of

166
00:26:48,059 --> 00:27:01,220
wood though, right? Okay. Now, bring that to the

167
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:11,930
crafting bench. Make a bed. There it is. This is my

168
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:20,869
house. You can always tell cuz it's a wall of

169
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:27,990
dirt. Holy shit. I'm not gonna read that one. The

170
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,130
house is ruined. It hasn't even started yet. Oh,

171
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,890
that makes me wanna throw up a little bit. I'm not

172
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,859
gonna lie. Okay, now, I need I need an axe. I need

173
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:44,140
no. God, it's it's so it's so much going on in my

174
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:51,509
brain. Open this up with this menu. Okay, so I

175
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:55,670
need to make this shit. I'll take it. All of it,

176
00:27:55,670 --> 00:28:03,210
please and it's 123 and then bang. Got yourself a

177
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,440
fucking bed. Perfect. So, now, when I die, I

178
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,019
will spawn here. That's not how I don't think

179
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:17,180
that's not how you place it, right? You have to

180
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,579
which way do I want the bed? Who cares? That's

181
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:34,680
your entrance right here. The door. Okay, there's

182
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,619
the door will come in here. Put a staircase

183
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,380
there. What do you guys think? The bed is near

184
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,859
your spawn point. What do you mean? That is the

185
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:51,900
spawn point. Alright, and let's just get some,

186
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
I need some, do I have enough wood for it,

187
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,019
right? I need to jump. Jumping is a little

188
00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:09,930
weird. Let's go with, no, that's sand. How do

189
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,559
you make an axe? Like that or something? How

190
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,720
does it, how do you make the the chopping

191
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:33,460
tree axe? Oh, okay, like that. I need a box.

192
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:40,569
How do you make a box? It's like this, right?

193
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:47,700
Yeah, put that here. Alright, get out of

194
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,200
this menu. Get out of the menu. So, now,

195
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,119
let's put this here. I just need to put a

196
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:58,519
bunch of dumb shit in here. Um, I don't

197
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,680
know. Put like the, can I send it there

198
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,960
quickly without having to tap like a

199
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,720
million times? There's got to be a way I

200
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,319
can like press that and just have it send

201
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,599
over there, right? Or do I actually have to

202
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,259
physically do this? Because I have that

203
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:19,420
pick throw. There's a button to do it. Just

204
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,940
try everything. Try everything. Alright,

205
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,299
that's right. This is left. This is up.

206
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,700
This is pick up. This is right. Down.

207
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:43,609
Left. Button. Nope. Button. Try jumping.

208
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,970
There you go. You got your clip. You

209
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,009
might have to send it in the control

210
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,180
menu. Ah, whatever. Alright, gravel,

211
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,619
cobblestone. It's not actually that

212
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,579
big of a deal. It really is not. That

213
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:00,220
kind of sucks though. Alright, I got meat.

214
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,900
Let's get that in here. You die, right,

215
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,819
if you don't eat.

216
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,059
Keep the dirt. Keep the sand. Just fucking

217
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:09,420
throw this in the trash.

218
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,130
Uh, these are almost broken. I don't

219
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,970
know. I need more cobblestone.

220
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:23,660
Okay, this is, this is spartar.

221
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,859
That wasn't me almost puking. That was

222
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,660
me just burping. Everything's fine.

223
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:38,630
Wood. Let's go. I'm just gonna get

224
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,670
this shit. I'm gonna cut down every

225
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,789
tree.

226
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:50,599
And I'm not gonna replant them. I

227
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,640
don't want them here. I'm gonna, I'm

228
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,559
gonna plant all the trees over there.

229
00:31:53,559 --> 00:32:05,430
Okay, I'm gonna get like maybe 30 or 40.

230
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:21,880
Probably 30 to 50 more full trees.

231
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,880
Can't, Microsoft owns this company now.

232
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,279
Can't I just pay some money?

233
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,160
Like 15 bucks to already have leather

234
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,299
fucking jackets on

235
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:34,339
and already have, what is that noise?

236
00:32:34,339 --> 00:32:54,680
I don't know. Yeah, like where's my

237
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,039
like 12 dollar? You don't have to

238
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:04,009
cut a tree down anymore.

239
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:08,630
I'd buy, I'd buy it twice. Times two

240
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,670
speed.

241
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:25,819
Okay, that's good. Did I get them all?

242
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:26,779
Wood tools.

243
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:33,269
I know, I know. I'm fucking terrible.

244
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:36,390
Wood. He's using wood tools.

245
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:45,849
What is that? What is this thing? Is

246
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:52,490
that a fish?

247
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,650
This fish in Minecraft? How long ago

248
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,930
was this put in?

249
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,329
What happened to that guy? It is a

250
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,589
fish.

251
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,430
That's so cool. Can you deserve

252
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:09,179
fishing rod? I thought that was an

253
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,139
error.

254
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,539
Like a source, a source engine error

255
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:13,820
spinning around.

256
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,150
They come up with a massive ocean

257
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,429
update, really.

258
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:23,829
That's pretty cool. Punch the fish.

259
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,550
No, not now. That's too busy.

260
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:34,679
Maybe in like a little bit, hold on.

261
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,840
All right, I need,

262
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,400
I need, I just need stone. Just get me

263
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,199
stone.

264
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,920
There's my stone cavity right here.

265
00:34:42,920 --> 00:35:00,380
Just give me a bunch of it.

266
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,579
This is gonna break.

267
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:08,090
Is that, I need to make it stone

268
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,610
pickaxe. Just go quick.

269
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:18,949
With a bed, you need to be even

270
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:19,989
shorter.

271
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:23,050
Yeah, I'm too tall to ride that ride.

272
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,250
I know, right?

273
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:30,070
Crazy. Fish? No. All right, let's get this

274
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,349
going here.

275
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:40,039
No, not what there is. I need sticks.

276
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,900
Fuck.

277
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm safe. Am I safe in the house?

278
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,710
That's

279
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,460
a glass of milk. Why does the moon

280
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,420
look like that?

281
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:58,579
Why is the moon a fucking rectangle?

282
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,400
All right, um, here we go. Just make

283
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,840
a ton of these.

284
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,619
Can I do this faster? I guess just by

285
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:08,820
tapping it.

286
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,260
I have, what's the fun to make this

287
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,179
happen instantly with everything?

288
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:15,820
Just, I'm gonna have to go in the

289
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,579
controls and see what it is.

290
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:22,789
Not now though, I'm only gonna week.

291
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:26,230
All right, so now let's get some,

292
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,070
what the hell is that?

293
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,670
No, I just want, I just want some

294
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,789
sticks.

295
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:36,860
All right, they have to be on top

296
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,820
of each other.

297
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:48,920
20 sticks, that sounds good. All right,

298
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,409
give me some good tools now. Now I

299
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:52,889
can

300
00:36:52,889 --> 00:36:54,809
break iron, right? Let's make two of

301
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:59,530
these.

302
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,650
No, that's the worst item in the

303
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,530
game.

304
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:11,130
All right, let's make a sword. Gonna need

305
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,869
that.

306
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:20,940
And, all right, looks fine.

307
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:31,449
Put the sticks back and throw the,

308
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,969
actually no, these are extreme backups.

309
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,010
I need them.

310
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:42,730
Cobblestone, put it up here. All right,

311
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:51,670
I'm ready. Let's go. Get in the bed.

312
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:59,429
No, I'm not, I'm not, I know this,

313
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,030
the trick here, guys. If I get in

314
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,469
this bed, they're gonna be standing

315
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:03,110
over me.

316
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,550
They're gonna be hovering over my

317
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,670
face.

318
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,300
I have to sleep with my knife out.

319
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:15,590
That's, that's old. I thought if you were

320
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,349
sleeping out in the open, then monsters

321
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:18,789
just spawned like in your

322
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:23,269
face. No, I know it skips the night,

323
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:26,250
but that doesn't happen anymore.

324
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,190
They patched that out. That was a

325
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,130
reason why I quit Minecraft.

326
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:39,719
War, Warcraft server mod. Why do I

327
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:45,860
have a Warcraft mod? What?

328
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,659
Why do you have Warcraft? I do not

329
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:53,289
have that.

330
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,050
No, that's not it. Let me be very,

331
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,650
very, very clear. There's not a joke

332
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:57,610
reveal there.

333
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,730
This isn't like, oh, he's just

334
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,489
pretending to play vanilla fucking

335
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,289
Minecraft,

336
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:02,489
and all of a sudden the sorcerer is

337
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:03,610
going to show up, and he's going to

338
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,289
start casting fucking spells at people.

339
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,130
No.

340
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,489
Everyone thinks that's, but that's,

341
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:09,929
no. I'm sorry, guys. You're going to be

342
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:11,210
really disappointed in like 20

343
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,329
minutes.

344
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,730
All right, let's go on an adventure.

345
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,929
And by adventure, I mean let's just

346
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:18,250
go break stuff until I find diamonds,

347
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,570
and then we're going to stop playing.

348
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,300
What do you say? I need to leave a

349
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,619
remember trail here.

350
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,780
Yeah, I'm like a dog, guys. I need to

351
00:39:32,780 --> 00:40:07,800
have this.

352
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,599
Okay, so if I just, just follow the

353
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,159
fucking

354
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,519
Hansel and Gretel trail. Here we go.

355
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,449
Let's go right here. I'm going right

356
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:20,329
here.

357
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:32,380
Nipro. I didn't get a show.

358
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,260
Don't matter. I don't even need it.

359
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,900
Here it is.

360
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,349
Got it. This is it, right? What is

361
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:40,309
this? This is,

362
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:48,179
this is that, is that what I need?

363
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,099
No. It's like little coal pieces,

364
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:50,820
right?

365
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,650
No, this is like the easiest

366
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,250
resource in the whole game,

367
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:06,570
because then I can make torches.

368
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:27,480
Oh, I remember this song. What did this,

369
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,079
what a nostalgia stream this really

370
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,079
turned out to be.

371
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:38,090
Guys, remember, remember when you were

372
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,449
11

373
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:53,050
three years ago? Who are you? Okay, let

374
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,489
me, like look, look, look, look. Hold

375
00:41:54,489 --> 00:41:55,769
on.

376
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:58,489
I'm 39. Listen, this is, I'm, how

377
00:41:58,489 --> 00:41:59,849
many viewers in here?

378
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:10,599
Like 4k? There's probably at least,

379
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,559
people probably only are at this

380
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,760
stream because it's Minecraft, and it's a

381
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,639
great fucking game.

382
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,960
I'm gonna stop swearing. I remember

383
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,920
when I was 11,

384
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,599
like 10 years ago. Wasn't that long

385
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,360
ago? Absolutely not.

386
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,000
Change the FOV. What do you mean the FOV?

387
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,949
Is the FOV bad? What's wrong with the

388
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:37,989
FOV?

389
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:52,230
Wait, hold on. You mean like in here?

390
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:59,130
Dynamic FOV?

391
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:06,630
What, what a fog start, where is it?

392
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,860
The FOV on the webcam. Why did you

393
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,219
decide to play Minecraft? Because I

394
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:14,179
lost a bet,

395
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:15,380
and I'm going to be very salty

396
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,329
about it. What a messy closet.

397
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:26,070
That's just an optical illusion. He's

398
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,349
answering the FOV prayers.

399
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:30,150
Well, is it a, is it a, I don't see it in

400
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,269
the menu.

401
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:42,940
Performance? Chunks? Other?

402
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,420
Max frame rate? View bobbing off? We use

403
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,030
bobs?

404
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,510
Dynamic FOV is not the same. It's not

405
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:55,960
in the video settings.

406
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,750
It's in the actual VR settings.

407
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:07,369
Stereo rendering. Stereo rendering?

408
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,289
Mirror display?

409
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:16,389
Hold on, back it up. HUD, head HUD.

410
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:20,900
Hide HUD. World scale.

411
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:26,219
Locomotion. Controls?

412
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:32,039
Let me just see, yeah, this is quick

413
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:39,559
commands. Crosshair size.

414
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,099
Maybe it's scale. Oh, wait, wait, wait,

415
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,260
hold on.

416
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:52,280
Rotation? No. FOV comfort reduction?

417
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,360
Shrink? Shrinks the field of view while

418
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
moving? Can help? No.

419
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:12,789
That's not it. It's under controls.

420
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:15,670
Sensitivity. Touchpad mode. Auto jump

421
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:28,179
for mouse.

422
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:33,239
There is no FOV. You guys are just

423
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:40,119
fucking with me.

424
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:44,059
Turn down the, it's actually on the

425
00:45:44,059 --> 00:45:45,340
vibe.

426
00:45:45,340 --> 00:46:00,940
Turn up the brightness.

427
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,179
I'm trying to do this nostalgia trip

428
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:04,860
for all of us 40 year olds that when

429
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,460
they were 11, 30 years ago when they

430
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,269
played this game,

431
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,190
and what I was going to say, I might

432
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,710
even talk in the right direction,

433
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,710
what I was going to say is the

434
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,230
reason why I said that comment is

435
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:17,429
because it's probably people that I

436
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:20,070
hear that I love Minecraft and are

437
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:20,789
like

438
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:23,269
love this shit and they don't watch

439
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:24,550
these streams

440
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:28,070
so I'm gonna stop saying bad things.

441
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,820
This is a nice house. I think I'll

442
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,860
keep this one.

443
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,900
All right, I'll turn the brightness

444
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:44,250
up. I'll at least do you that.

445
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:49,739
How do I do that? Dynamic lights?

446
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:55,219
Quality shaders? Oh, dog that's my

447
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,980
entire IP address.

448
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:10,820
It's every IP I've ever had. Anybody

449
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,349
know where this is?

450
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:16,469
Am I blind? No, I- okay. Brightness,

451
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,119
moody.

452
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,360
I see- I see the- I see moody.

453
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,719
I don't- that's not a-

454
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:44,389
this doesn't even do anything.

455
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:51,699
Fucking Minecraft VR. I almost just

456
00:47:51,699 --> 00:47:52,980
clicked that thinking that you guys

457
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:58,090
were going to appear.

458
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,289
All right, let's go back. I'll put

459
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:02,900
brightness up to like plus 20.

460
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,380
There you go. Now everybody can see.

461
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,980
Now everybody can have so much fun.

462
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,219
Oh boy, Minecraft. Remember we did

463
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,059
that pit cross level that we cheated

464
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:13,059
and now he has to play this? That's

465
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:21,510
why he's here.

466
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,579
This actually is- this is really cool.

467
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:27,449
Like if- I'm not gonna fuck around.

468
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:32,010
This is actually really cool.

469
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,369
Okay, don't- I'm gonna hurt the fucking

470
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,460
vibe.

471
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,820
Here we go. Can I please get back to

472
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:50,920
what I was doing now?

473
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,719
Just give me- ooh, we found ourselves

474
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,099
a cavern.

475
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,099
This is what you play for. All right,

476
00:48:58,099 --> 00:48:59,860
there it is. There it is. There it is.

477
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,460
There it is. There it is.

478
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,900
This is gonna kill me. Oh shit, is this-

479
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,460
will I die from this?

480
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:24,710
This is really interesting like this.

481
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:34,199
I just get this and then that was a

482
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:35,159
big chunk, right?

483
00:49:35,159 --> 00:49:39,260
Is that it? That's all that was here?

484
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:47,820
Oh fuck, look at that. Oh well, I'm

485
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,780
getting like Warcraft stones.

486
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,219
Do I actually have a mod of stuff? Why

487
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,619
am I getting the Warcraft stones?

488
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:55,739
That's a mod, right? That's like

489
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:57,590
mag- mana?

490
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,909
It's a joke. It's a- I'm kidding. It's a-

491
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:01,269
I'm making that up.

492
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:06,420
I know what it is. It's experience

493
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,980
points.

494
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,340
Oh, my germ is getting like real

495
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,860
salty lately.

496
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,539
What's going on with that?

497
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:16,059
I haven't watched the streams in like a

498
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:18,699
few weeks. Germa's like really salty.

499
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:33,579
What was that? Okay. Oh, where?

500
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:42,949
Holy shit, that's so much worse in VR.

501
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:43,909
Jesus.

502
00:50:43,909 --> 00:50:47,349
I got his gallbladder. Okay, I need to

503
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:48,230
make-

504
00:50:48,230 --> 00:51:07,130
I'm gonna make some torches here.

505
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,460
Finally, I have light. All right, close

506
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,300
this up.

507
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,579
Wow. Oh, turn the brightness up,

508
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,769
Jeremy.

509
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:21,449
I can't see, Jeremy. He's looking

510
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:30,329
real salty, ain't he, Jeremy?

511
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:35,269
Human fingers. I know it's here. I see

512
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:35,750
it.

513
00:51:35,750 --> 00:52:11,340
Is that it? Do you think they'll be

514
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,099
talking about Minecraft?

515
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:14,940
That's not a real wall. Uh, do you

516
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:15,739
think they'll be talking about

517
00:52:15,739 --> 00:52:17,260
Minecraft as like one of the greatest

518
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,460
human inventions

519
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,860
in like a hundred years or something?

520
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,500
Do you think like kids,

521
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,619
like a hundred years from now, this

522
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,590
will be in a textbook?

523
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,940
I think it will be. I really do. I

524
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,900
really think they'll be talking about

525
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,260
this. Like, there'll be the,

526
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,099
you know, the invention of the water

527
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,980
fountain wheel

528
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,099
and then like the washing machine

529
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:48,539
Minecraft. They'll all be in a row.

530
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,900
This goes really- all right, there's a

531
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,340
creeper down there.

532
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,380
Is that- no, that's not a creeper.

533
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:59,480
What the hell is that? Is that one-

534
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,599
that's one of those bow skeletons,

535
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:01,400
right?

536
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:21,190
I can't reach them mice. What the

537
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,719
fuck is that?

538
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:26,440
Is there bats? They- what else is in

539
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:31,849
this game?

540
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:33,130
All right, I'm gonna be- there's so

541
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:37,769
much shit down here.

542
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:50,760
That does just hurt my fucking neck and

543
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,730
back.

544
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,809
I don't think it's worth me doing this.

545
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:57,880
Let me just go over here, get up the

546
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,280
sword.

547
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,719
Look at all this shit. Okay, hold on.

548
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:16,340
Diamonds. This goes so deep.

549
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:22,010
I'm almost out of pickaxe fluid.

550
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,130
All right, it's time to go back up. I

551
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:31,059
gotta go back up.

552
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,070
Almost. I got plenty though. That's

553
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,949
good.

554
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:39,989
Let me get them all before it

555
00:54:39,989 --> 00:55:05,530
breaks. Good. Okay,

556
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,929
time to get out of here. I hear

557
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,289
water right there.

558
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:16,579
What the hell was that? Why did a

559
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,019
horror movie door just open?

560
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:32,460
Is it a dungeon? All right, I'm gonna

561
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,300
remember this then. Remember this.

562
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,849
All right, let's go up. I- I can't go

563
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:41,500
up.

564
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,179
I have to- I have to make a crafting

565
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:44,380
bench down here.

566
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:52,730
No, I have a secret one. Okay,

567
00:55:52,730 --> 00:56:02,409
never mind. I heard a car.

568
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:07,960
All right, let's go- let's get the

569
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,000
hell out of here.

570
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:14,619
I can get a couple of these if I

571
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:18,659
really want. I'm doing that the

572
00:56:18,659 --> 00:56:20,940
worst possible way.

573
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,460
Might- might as well get them all,

574
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:43,130
right? This has got to be some kind

575
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:44,010
of record of

576
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:50,599
coal in one spot. It just never ends.

577
00:56:50,599 --> 00:57:11,190
Oh, we unveiled the secret iron. Go on,

578
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:12,940
is that it?

579
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,619
That's it. All right, I guess go up

580
00:57:14,619 --> 00:57:16,710
here.

581
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,269
I see- there's dirt right there, which

582
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,110
means I'm at land,

583
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,820
where I will be in a second. The best

584
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,019
part of Minecraft is when you come

585
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:27,619
out of the sewer hole.

586
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:30,840
Ugh! Uh, and you just look around and

587
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:57,300
see where you are.

588
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:25,880
Uh, okay, a little bit more. Now let's

589
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:32,650
see where we're gonna end up.

590
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:37,030
How far did- uh, down did I go?

591
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:57,860
What? I can't be that much further.

592
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,489
Uh-oh. Where's my- where's my trail? Where's my trail?

593
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:08,139
Where was that? That was real cool.

594
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:09,659
Where- okay, where- where's my trail?

595
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:10,539
Right there.

596
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:26,980
Oh my god, I'm dead! Oh my god, I'm dead!

597
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,019
Oh, go! What's happening? Go!

598
00:59:30,019 --> 00:59:56,940
Okay, here we go. Cook. Eat. I got

599
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,920
seven out of ten.

600
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,780
All right, let me- let me go- hold on.

601
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:08,019
Let's, uh, no, no, no, no, no. What do I need?

602
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:13,880
Focus. Focus, Mike, focus. Don't say

603
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,920
your real name, though.

604
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:22,170
People will fucking know. Don't know who you are.

605
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:25,699
All right, let's just make a fucking bunch of these.

606
01:00:25,699 --> 01:00:43,139
I'm gonna make 64 of them. Perfect number.

607
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:47,320
All right, now I need to- I gotta put them in here.

608
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:59,340
So give me the hell out of here. That's all I want. Just enough so I can see

609
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,590
what the hell I'm doing later. All right, where's that meat?

610
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:10,059
I need to cook the meat in the furnace, so let's get that meat.

611
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:16,889
Okay, put it down here. Gotta eat the egg sack.

612
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:33,780
There we go. Perfect. Why is this screen flashing? It's because I'm

613
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:40,760
dying. Once I have a couple of cooked

614
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:47,130
meats, I'll be just fine. For instance, how do you eat it?

615
01:01:47,130 --> 01:02:05,369
You actually have to put it in your mouth, though. Okay, um,

616
01:02:05,369 --> 01:02:10,090
don't kill it. Is that rare? Were the squids- I think they were squids

617
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,539
when I played before. I don't think I can really remember.

618
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:20,949
All right, let's move. Let's- I gotta make some gear.

619
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:30,139
Let's make some iron helmets. All right, this is just a joke.

620
01:02:30,139 --> 01:02:34,389
Why is there no sell button? How come- why can't I have like a little

621
01:02:34,389 --> 01:02:36,949
thing over here that I can just drag and it just sells it?

622
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:47,099
All right, get the spider sack thing out of here.

623
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:51,739
Wheat seeds, oak saplings, get out of here.

624
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:54,539
All right, I need to make a bunch of shit. All right, I'm gonna make my

625
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:56,780
house out of- I'm gonna make the floor out of wood.

626
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,639
And the walls out of stone. Get all this. What the hell?

627
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:20,809
Andesite? D.O. Wright? What are these? The new materials?

628
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:24,170
I'm gonna hold on to them just in case I need them. I need- let's make

629
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:28,650
some shit. So I need sticks. Let's go over here.

630
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:44,460
All right, we got- just make a bunch. Now let's go with

631
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:50,219
one, two. I'm going to make- oh, you have to smelt the iron into bars,

632
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:59,699
right? We need to start that process. Come

633
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:07,739
here. Go for it. And then I can make iron

634
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:16,949
pickaxe, iron sword, iron shield, iron armor. So, did you see any good

635
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:22,250
movies? D.O. Wright, Andesite, and Granite are

636
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:34,469
cosmetic stones. Okay. You can dual wield? Why am I in my swim

637
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:44,380
trunks? Guys, it's a nice day today. And

638
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:53,750
I didn't go swimming. I wanted to though.

639
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,820
How did something get in my eye? How is that possible?

640
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,900
How is it possible that something got in my eye? I was locked in. I was

641
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:09,619
pressured closed in here. How long has it been? Have I

642
01:05:09,619 --> 01:05:14,699
been playing Minecraft for an hour? I've been in Minecraft VR for an

643
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:26,550
hour and six minutes. What the fuck?

644
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:30,809
Yeah, I've been having fun. Told you, I'm gonna get to diamonds.

645
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:34,969
I'm gonna make a diamond pickaxe. Then I'm gonna swing as hard as I can down

646
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:49,670
through my stomach in an uninstalled game. All right.

647
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:55,530
That was weird. Oh, I need water too. Where's my-

648
01:05:55,530 --> 01:06:04,340
Can somebody guide me? Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster. Recipe for disaster.

649
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:32,949
I need a fucking straw. I need a tube. Drinking is really hard when you

650
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:37,909
can't see. Why? We do it so often. We do it every day.

651
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:42,230
Thousands of times a week. Why is it so hard to do anything?

652
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:55,400
Where's the other iron? Right there. 14. Let me get this.

653
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:03,099
Close this up. What? Just happened. Green's

654
01:07:03,099 --> 01:07:07,420
tea sip has made the advancement. Why is this in my other hand?

655
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:15,110
How do I get that out of my hand? How do I take this off?

656
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:27,460
Maybe do I want- How do I get this off? Okay.

657
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:38,500
Let me- I don't like that. Is there a reason why I can't grab this?

658
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:53,860
No. What happened? What did I do? Too far away?

659
01:07:53,860 --> 01:08:01,179
I don't think- No. They usually have the cursor. It's in the slot.

660
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:07,260
Yeah, but- Okay. Ready? See? Open the furnace. Cursor's gone.

661
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:25,289
It's your finger. No, it's not. Did the game lose focus? I don't think so.

662
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:45,369
I didn't- It did. I don't know how. I told you.

663
01:08:45,369 --> 01:08:55,180
Can we get a round of applause for VR, Josh? This is my favorite song.

664
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,699
All right, so let's make some good tools.

665
01:08:58,699 --> 01:09:12,069
Over here. So let's do the most important one.

666
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:23,479
Solar paneling. I'm gonna make two of these.

667
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:33,239
What- This is a helmet, right? This is a chest piece?

668
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:48,460
What's the chest? I know this is legs. Or I thought it was.

669
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:57,140
All right, should I make boots? Should I make- Should I make tools first?

670
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,180
I'm gonna make tools first. I don't care if it's wrong.

671
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:11,319
I might never see iron ever again. Extreme backup.

672
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:24,710
Make another sword. Another pickaxe. I have three pickaxe- three iron pickaxes.

673
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,619
I have two right now. And I also- I want a shovel, too.

674
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:43,590
I want two shovels. And- Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? What's going on?

675
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:52,579
What's going on with my axe? What's wrong? What's wrong?

676
01:10:52,579 --> 01:11:01,689
What's going on? You only need two- I'm fine. I'm good.

677
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:10,100
I use the shovel a lot. Okay, so that's

678
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:22,659
one, two, three. One, two. Let's get this down here.

679
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:26,920
I'm not going to use that right now. All right, storage.

680
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:37,100
Is it an iron pick? Yeah. Put the the deal right of the shit in here.

681
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:42,149
Put the iron in there. I'm gonna keep the meat on me.

682
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:45,829
I'm gonna keep, oh, some coal. Not all of it, just in case something horrible

683
01:11:45,829 --> 01:11:50,810
happens. Eleven. That's fine. I'm gonna put that

684
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:57,619
there. I got this here. Sticks. Don't need them.

685
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:02,100
Birch. Planks. Sand. Don't need sand anymore. Don't need dirt. Get them out

686
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:32,119
of here. Let me just get rid of these.

687
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:37,000
What was it? It was like- it was some weird button. I did it before.

688
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:50,060
There it is. Okay. Time to build the house. You ready?

689
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:55,029
You ready for the most boring part of this whole stream? Or it could be fun.

690
01:12:55,029 --> 01:13:03,159
I'll do it quick. Don't worry. I thought those were all monsters.

691
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:06,520
Oak. Cobblestone. Let's at least get a nice floor.

692
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:32,170
I can't believe he doesn't even have a texture pack. Unbelievable.

693
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:37,260
Use your shovel. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

694
01:13:37,260 --> 01:14:05,239
That's why I made two. This is sick. Really not bad. Not, not bad.

695
01:14:05,239 --> 01:14:15,850
Just as a method to my madness. Just wait. Clear this out.

696
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:23,220
It's not gonna be perfect, but at least look alright. There, there. Shit just

697
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:40,119
floats, right? Yeah. Yeah. Is it all-

698
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:49,380
Should I just keep- should I have the bodies down here?

699
01:14:49,380 --> 01:15:02,710
No, no, no, no, no. Don't sleep. Leave the bed. Not yet.

700
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:16,380
What are you doing? Get- Alright. Looking good.

701
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:20,060
Okay. How do you- how do you even like do

702
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,260
Minecraft commentary? How do I even like say what it is?

703
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:29,539
Okay, there we are. We got wood here now, folks. Alright.

704
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:35,739
Looks pretty good. Hey, did I tell you I had jury duty?

705
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:49,369
Yeah. Here's a kind of chair. Ah, it don't matter.

706
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:58,539
Does it matter if I don't have that here? Switch shovel.

707
01:15:58,539 --> 01:16:02,619
Oh shit. Is it button on my hand to it?

708
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:07,399
Alright. Holy shit. People must so support.

709
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:19,180
Wow. This is- you can't do this in regular Minecraft.

710
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:29,689
You can? Oh. Well. Oh, well. No, don't do that. Alright, that's good.

711
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:35,659
Something I think a lot of you guys might underestimate

712
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:39,739
or overestimate is the fact that if I have a piece of green here that I'm

713
01:16:39,739 --> 01:17:00,020
not- it's okay. I'm gonna be fine. I'm not gonna look- I'm not

714
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:03,220
gonna look at chat. I'm not gonna look. I already know what

715
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:11,130
you're saying. I already know what you're saying. I don't need to look.

716
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:20,250
How do I use this? This is slower than doing it with-

717
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:39,079
This is slower. I should be doing sword in this hand.

718
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:43,260
No, I didn't see the short joke. I saw that I'm not using my shovel.

719
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:47,100
What the- that- why do I have two ice creams?

720
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:51,500
All I need is one. And why the fuck is this one not chocolate

721
01:17:51,500 --> 01:18:22,680
is what I want to ask. Kill fish. I got it. Look at that house.

722
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:37,340
That's worth a million. That'll be worth a million someday.

723
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:42,439
A million of what? A million racy's pacy's.

724
01:18:42,439 --> 01:18:47,720
So let's- it's not done. Don't say it's bad until it's done.

725
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:56,680
Just wait for my walk-in closet in my open kitchen.

726
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:41,159
Just saying. I'm not even gonna look at the chat. I don't even need to.

727
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:44,229
Why would I need to look at it? I already know how to do this. I don't

728
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:46,390
know how to play this. Guys, I think I'm moving forward. I

729
01:19:46,390 --> 01:20:00,069
think I'm gonna have no chat. Yeah, I think- what do you think?

730
01:20:00,069 --> 01:20:28,340
Shit. I mean now I'm just- I'm just playing Minecraft.

731
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,539
This is what I do every time. Every single time I've ever opened this

732
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:40,170
game. It goes the same way. No differences.

733
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:46,279
This is the same house that I make. It's only just dirt on the top,

734
01:20:46,279 --> 01:20:50,439
wood on the bottom, cobblestone on the sides. And then I put a door on

735
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:55,899
and then I go down and I look for diamonds. I've groundhog day'd this

736
01:20:55,899 --> 01:21:07,399
scenario probably 40 times. The only- the only

737
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:19,899
this time I'm actually in it. I'm here right now. So like I said

738
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:22,619
there's a lot of the potential like this. Some

739
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:27,750
you know young kids here right now. Made a reference to it before.

740
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,270
I'm not that good. I'm pretty- I do some like inter- I'll make like a

741
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:36,149
kitchen eventually here. But I don't expect me to like know

742
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:41,510
how to do the lanterns or the

743
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:51,350
electric stone cubes, redstone. I don't know how to do that. I'm out

744
01:21:51,350 --> 01:22:01,340
of stone. I'm actually out of stone. All right.

745
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:06,460
Now I'm good to go for another adventure. I got meat.

746
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:12,630
This is what I like to do. Hey kids this is how I do it. Find a corner of

747
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:15,590
your house and turn it into the basement. And then

748
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:24,939
the basement goes down into the mine. This is how I do it. So let's go over

749
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:33,289
here. You know I'm gonna just take this

750
01:22:33,289 --> 01:22:38,710
off. Like this- this- this is not happening.

751
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,659
I'm gonna be honest with you. So for instance now I'm gonna- there's a

752
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:50,119
front door. Open. Here we are. This leads down.

753
01:22:50,119 --> 01:23:02,199
It's gonna go down like this. This is my basement. See we're

754
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:08,899
gonna get some steps. Move it more forward again. Another

755
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:32,119
step. What is that? Okay. This is gonna be

756
01:23:32,119 --> 01:23:34,840
paved. I'm gonna pave that whole thing.

757
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:49,850
Here we go. One, two, three, four, five.

758
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:57,659
Go down again. Make sure you bring enough light.

759
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:04,439
I can take that one back. All right. One more.

760
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:22,859
Right. Are you following along? You following along here?

761
01:24:22,859 --> 01:24:26,979
There we go. What do you think? Too deep. Too deep.

762
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:42,100
Keep torch in left hand. That's not a bad idea.

763
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:46,649
Resident sleeper. There's 31 torches in my hand.

764
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:57,720
Holy shit. I didn't even know you could do that. Look.

765
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:04,729
I lost a bet. That's why I'm here. I think that's good for now.

766
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:11,779
This way. Gonna carve out a little section.

767
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:20,220
A little more over here. How you doing? Sleepy yet?

768
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:29,800
How you feeling? You okay? Got a headache? You got a running nose?

769
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:40,020
Fucking sorry to hear that. Oh sorry. I'm flipping sorry to hear that.

770
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:44,789
All right. Let's keep going. This is where it gets interesting at.

771
01:25:44,789 --> 01:25:54,760
Uh what? Negative like 20 below. I didn't dig straight down.

772
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:02,539
I clearly came down on a little staircase. Don't be afraid to say you

773
01:26:02,539 --> 01:26:10,010
like this and you're enjoying it. I am. This is fun. You know I'm just

774
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:16,199
I'm just talking shit guys. That's all. Don't take anything I say seriously.

775
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:35,430
I'm just kidding around. I'm just talking about. Never mind.

776
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:42,310
Okay. Actually I won. I hear something.

777
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:46,390
We're getting to a point where I need to get prepared with a sword.

778
01:26:46,390 --> 01:27:07,779
Is that a special song? And I think it's behind one of these doors.

779
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:20,680
That's it's kind of stone. What is that? Granite. They had so many different

780
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:50,119
cosmetic rocks. Can something happen?

781
01:27:50,119 --> 01:28:23,220
Stop. Calm down. Calm down. Where's my little like

782
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:26,819
uh seismograph meter? Don't I have one of those?

783
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:40,710
Look up. Are those motorcycles in my room?

784
01:28:40,710 --> 01:29:08,520
I'm in VR. I can't tell. Damn it. I gotta get up there.

785
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:32,180
Oh shit. There's even more. I just realized something. This was not

786
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:38,819
intentionally planned or anything but the next game that I'm gonna play

787
01:29:38,819 --> 01:29:42,500
is having a realization about something. You'll see.

788
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:56,170
Oh no. That was the thing breaking. Okay. How about

789
01:29:56,170 --> 01:30:06,279
uh I feel like everyone might leave on the next game.

790
01:30:06,279 --> 01:30:16,520
Everybody came here because like oh Minecraft VR. Cool.

791
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:24,569
I don't get lost down here. Those are more for breadcrumbs than

792
01:30:24,569 --> 01:30:37,239
anything else. Am I playing this on peaceful? You know it's on survival.

793
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:47,750
At least it should be. I'm playing this on creative mode.

794
01:30:47,750 --> 01:31:07,289
Always get away back up. We're getting deep. I hear running water.

795
01:31:07,289 --> 01:31:14,819
Right. I think I'm in the ocean right now.

796
01:31:14,819 --> 01:31:19,210
This is baffling tile. What is this? What kind of

797
01:31:19,210 --> 01:31:33,560
rock is that? Does it have a name? Get it.

798
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:54,630
Okay. Oh I was already down here. All right.

799
01:31:54,630 --> 01:32:04,939
There was all kinds of shit. There's more of uh that whatever the hell that is.

800
01:32:04,939 --> 01:32:23,460
God damn it. I tried. Light. I want more light.

801
01:32:23,460 --> 01:33:07,640
I'm going all the way down. Hey. Oh I'm fine. Can you come up here?

802
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:11,930
I'll just farm him. Come on up. Was there a baby?

803
01:33:11,930 --> 01:33:34,170
There's a baby zombie. Where's the baby? Where'd the baby go?

804
01:33:34,170 --> 01:34:04,460
No don't do that. Jesus. If I drop down there I'm just gonna die.

805
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:22,579
What? What the where? I'm so confused. What happened? Where? I just got

806
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:39,739
something. Nothing even hit me. Why am I wearing bathing shorts? That's not

807
01:34:39,739 --> 01:34:54,220
important. Hey. Hey. See you later kid.

808
01:34:54,220 --> 01:35:03,340
Double cigar. Please think it was funny. Please think it was funny. Please

809
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:07,420
think it was funny. Please think it was funny. Please think it was funny.

810
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:33,479
Yes. All right I'll come back to that. Is it gone?

811
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:51,100
Yeah. Made it out alive. Minecraft VR. Not even a problem.

812
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:57,369
I can smell diamonds. I think I'm gonna fall into a diamond pit right here.

813
01:35:57,369 --> 01:36:11,800
How can you tell when you're close to diamonds? Look at how they're even

814
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:36,869
deeper. Wow. Do those hurt you? Or are they just

815
01:36:36,869 --> 01:37:23,380
annoying? Found it. Oh my god there was one in my face.

816
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:57,430
Oh no it hurt. God. Minecraft is really just a horror game.

817
01:37:57,430 --> 01:38:01,829
In VR it's just scary monsters around corners.

818
01:38:01,829 --> 01:38:29,539
Have I been here before? I don't think I've been down here before.

819
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:32,420
That really did feel like I was playing and

820
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:36,869
somebody in chat was just spawning stuff in front of me.

821
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:41,140
Like I have twitch enabled and it's spawn creeper.

822
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:58,550
No. I'll take more iron. I've missed a bunch of it too. It's been

823
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:16,699
panicking. What is that? No. Sick. Okay. Might as well get it all. For one

824
01:39:16,699 --> 01:39:19,180
second I thought I was back in my basement and was like how did that

825
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:37,989
happen? I can't wear it. I hear the music.

826
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:42,199
That means I'm getting close right to something. Doesn't the music start

827
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:53,939
uh trigger when you get near something cool?

828
01:39:53,939 --> 01:40:02,010
I'm going in too deep. I'm going in too deep. I have to stop. I gotta- I don't

829
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:08,300
know where I'm gonna end up. I'm gonna end up in a completely

830
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:13,939
different place. I gotta go back. Did it keep going? I need to- I need

831
01:40:13,939 --> 01:40:18,899
to know where I am. I'm- I'm gonna be lost. Seriously I have to put

832
01:40:18,899 --> 01:40:21,619
these everywhere because I'll fucking forget.

833
01:40:21,619 --> 01:40:58,890
Not gonna lay without you anymore. Yeah. Yeah. You're hiding on me. It's fine.

834
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,810
All right. I'm almost out of- I- I can't keep going.

835
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:21,020
I'm almost out of power. Got it. Redstone. There it is.

836
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:27,060
Now I can not know how to make anything because I have no idea.

837
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:45,609
What's this? Bluestone. All right.

838
01:41:47,770 --> 01:42:21,529
Bear back. I'm gonna go uh I'm gonna take this so bear back.

839
01:42:21,609 --> 01:42:25,210
First rule. I know. I know. I only did- I did it like three times. I haven't done

840
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:33,029
that the entire game. I dug down three times. I didn't do

841
01:42:33,029 --> 01:42:38,149
that the other times. The one time that I do it. I do it

842
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:48,060
like twice. No that's not even like-

843
01:42:48,060 --> 01:42:52,949
What if- I'm fucking so stupid. I was down so deep too. I should have known

844
01:42:52,949 --> 01:43:10,390
better. I haven't played uh whatever. Don't dig straight down. But it's

845
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:18,060
different when you're uh- I can't even give an excuse.

846
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:21,859
I'll be right back. I'm gonna take piss because of water in my face.

847
01:43:21,859 --> 01:43:26,699
Refill my cup after I drink it. There are literally shirts that say that.

848
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:33,899
I know. I thought I had at least like one or two seconds to do it.

849
01:43:33,899 --> 01:45:51,779
Oh whatever. I'll be right back. I can get back there. My stuff is still okay

850
01:45:51,779 --> 01:46:05,289
right? It burnt in the one square. It had

851
01:46:05,289 --> 01:46:12,550
to be the square right there too. I'm so embarrassed. God damn it.

852
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:18,859
Because that's like okay. That happened to people

853
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:22,460
four or five years ago and that was like oh what don't dig down in

854
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:39,289
Minecraft. It's 2013. Watch this guy burn because he

855
01:46:39,289 --> 01:46:47,529
fell down in a cube in Minecraft. Oh by the way no it's not 2011.

856
01:46:47,529 --> 01:47:07,140
It's 2019. Uh did somebody just give a hundred bucks right now?

857
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:10,500
I just pulled my headset off. I'm looking at a hundred dollars

858
01:47:10,579 --> 01:47:15,850
from CabBadger. That is a fantastic shirt Jeremy. Where'd you get it?

859
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:25,399
Uh it was a gift. I actually don't know. But thank you CabBadger for the

860
01:47:25,399 --> 01:47:28,840
hundred dollars and Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. I can't say that now.

861
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:40,250
Thank you for the community subs. Thank you. Yeah it was gifted to me.

862
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:49,449
Are we gonna go swimming later? No. I even did the JermaCraft thing.

863
01:47:49,449 --> 01:47:51,850
All right one more thing. I just want one more try. I just want to get-

864
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:58,760
hold on. Let me just get down. I'm gonna do

865
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,680
one more try and then we're gonna move on.

866
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:12,020
Like I'm so pissed off that that's how it ends. People are gonna watch

867
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:20,220
that clip and it's gonna be like- the people are just gonna shake their heads

868
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:33,560
and be like oh well that good- good job.

869
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:37,460
How many did I go down? How many did I go down?

870
01:48:37,460 --> 01:49:04,859
One, two, three, four, five. You guys let me do that six times?

871
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:09,619
I can't believe I did that six times. I just got complacent.

872
01:49:09,619 --> 01:49:19,130
All right can I- what is this putting me? Your house is missing.

873
01:49:19,130 --> 01:49:22,170
All right can- is really every single

874
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:29,109
solitary item burnt completely. Every single item is burnt

875
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:49,340
in that one square. It's not even hard to get that shit.

876
01:49:49,340 --> 01:50:05,800
Oh Tetris. No it's really not. Plus didn't I save some-

877
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:18,069
I saved some stuff didn't I? There it is. We're going back in there.

878
01:50:18,069 --> 01:50:22,500
Look I'm about to sell somebody a watch.

879
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:28,409
Oh let me see the diamond on that. Let's see.

880
01:50:28,409 --> 01:50:31,369
It looks like it's gone through a little bit of

881
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:48,069
erosion. Hold on. 250. I have a request. Lose the shorts.

882
01:50:48,069 --> 01:51:03,239
All right. All right yeah I just pulled it out of my fucking ear again.

883
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:15,380
Let's go. What is- something's pulling my hair.

884
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:19,579
Explain the shorts. There is no- something is odd here.

885
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:32,949
What is doing this? I don't- what do you mean- there is nothing to explain.

886
01:51:32,949 --> 01:51:37,979
I still can't believe you did that lava thing. Look it- it's a- look I still

887
01:51:37,979 --> 01:51:41,659
have iron. I can make a sword or I can make a-

888
01:51:41,659 --> 01:51:45,020
probably make a shovel. No I'm gonna make a sword. And then I

889
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:51,670
can make- everything's fine. Don't worry.

890
01:51:51,670 --> 01:52:02,680
Let's do it. That's why you make these.

891
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:05,720
Not total- actually it's probably for the best that that happened.

892
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:22,890
I had so much trash. All right now- hmm.

893
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:55,989
Any shovels? Where's the audio? I feel like I'm missing audio here. Okay.

894
01:52:55,989 --> 01:53:13,859
My torches. Fuck. All my torches are gone.

895
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:36,010
That should be good. Maybe- maybe uh- no. I'll get some more.

896
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:42,279
I know that's fine. 64. Maximo. I'm going back in there. I don't have

897
01:53:42,279 --> 01:53:56,060
any food but it's all right. What the hell? All right let's go.

898
01:53:56,060 --> 01:54:03,380
Are you ready? Back in there. Back to get something.

899
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:13,060
Salvageable. We haven't seen a solo in stream

900
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:22,600
juke for so long. Bring woo- wood. What? Bring wood?

901
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:30,630
I don't have any food. It's all gone. All right I guess I could just go kill

902
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:46,149
something. I got a nice weapon here. I just

903
01:54:46,149 --> 01:55:53,000
need like a cow or something right? Perfect. Okay food. Okay we're good.

904
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:06,409
Don't kill it? How am I supposed to get food? I got plenty of food now.

905
01:56:06,409 --> 01:57:02,699
Food. 12 o'clock. I'm not gonna drown. Now I'm gonna store this food. I'll cook

906
01:57:02,699 --> 01:57:24,979
some of it and then I'm time to go. How do I go faster? Okay fishing.

907
01:57:24,979 --> 01:57:47,609
What the hell was that? Do they have like drowned zombies?

908
01:57:47,609 --> 01:57:53,939
All right that's good. Time to cook it. Back here.

909
01:57:53,939 --> 01:58:03,689
I'm going down there one more time. I'm gonna try to go down to where I

910
01:58:03,689 --> 01:58:17,609
was and then get- and try to get diamonds.

911
01:58:17,609 --> 01:58:26,329
This is actually pretty fun. You're doing shots of tequila for me.

912
01:58:26,329 --> 01:58:33,960
Oh that's right. It's St. Patrick's Day. I'm playing Minecraft. What are you

913
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:39,850
doing? What are you doing on St. Patty's Day? How are you?

914
01:58:39,850 --> 01:58:47,989
Bone meal. Raw salmon. Raw cod. All right let's do- let's cook the

915
01:58:47,989 --> 01:58:53,880
chickens. Cook the chickens and eat the eggs

916
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:58,039
and have two full chickens and two sammons.

917
01:58:58,039 --> 01:59:21,939
That sounds good to me. This is the sad song.

918
01:59:21,939 --> 01:59:41,159
Why would Sour Please be here? I'm gonna eat that egg. How do I eat

919
01:59:41,159 --> 01:59:49,640
the egg? It's raw? You can eat raw eggs in this game. I

920
01:59:49,640 --> 02:00:13,670
thought you could. I can't eat a raw egg? Says who?

921
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:22,729
You don't eat eggs. And now I'm gonna knock down one tree

922
02:00:22,729 --> 02:00:25,529
and get some wood in my inventory and then I'm going down there and

923
02:00:25,529 --> 02:00:27,770
that's- that's it. But if it happens down there it's

924
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:32,149
over. I didn't even build a whole damn house.

925
02:00:32,149 --> 02:00:38,699
It's an open floor plan guys. All right let's get some wood.

926
02:00:38,699 --> 02:00:48,359
I'm gonna eat this. Let's go get some wood and then that's it.

927
02:00:48,359 --> 02:01:09,270
Time to go adventure again. Down to the hill.

928
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:28,840
All right let's go. Just in case I need it for anything.

929
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:37,859
All right let's store this. Um I- I got a full chicken. I got plenty of

930
02:01:37,859 --> 02:01:41,560
food. Torches. Get this out of here. Get

931
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:44,789
the rotten meat out of here. Kelp get it out of here.

932
02:01:44,789 --> 02:01:48,149
Good. What's this? White wool. Don't need it.

933
02:01:48,149 --> 02:02:00,789
Here we go. See I didn't do it here. I only did it in one

934
02:02:00,789 --> 02:02:13,939
fucking place. I got all this dug out. What?

935
02:02:13,939 --> 02:02:38,090
Oh shit. How did I even manage to do this?

936
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:46,149
Then I went down here. Right. Let's get some more padding for this

937
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:53,989
ball. All right I'm remembering. And then there

938
02:02:53,989 --> 02:03:00,420
was a big fight down here. I panicked. I ran

939
02:03:00,420 --> 02:04:08,149
that way. What the fuck? Okay um I don't know where I went.

940
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:39,479
I see an arrow. Where do I want to go back? Why do I want to go back? That's a

941
02:04:39,479 --> 02:04:46,489
really actually- that's a great new point to go from here.

942
02:04:46,489 --> 02:05:02,119
All right perfect. Build the inventory back up.

943
02:05:02,119 --> 02:05:13,000
This way. That way. Let's just keep going across.

944
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,489
So I'm- I'm down pretty deep. Maybe I should put a bed down here.

945
02:05:18,489 --> 02:05:48,039
Just keep progressing. I'm gonna go down.

946
02:05:48,039 --> 02:06:11,590
I'll do that again. That shit's not gonna happen more than once.

947
02:06:11,590 --> 02:06:37,159
Hello? Uh okay. Thank you. Does that mean something?

948
02:06:37,239 --> 02:07:04,970
What does that mean? I'm not gonna get misdirected in this right?

949
02:07:04,970 --> 02:07:19,939
And you're wondering why I brought so many tools? This is why.

950
02:07:19,939 --> 02:07:35,909
Dump. When do I get to the- I'm gotta be close to getting to the bottom of

951
02:07:35,909 --> 02:07:41,029
the world here. What cube is the bottom of the

952
02:07:41,029 --> 02:08:29,270
world? Like cube 300 right? It's like 320 or something.

953
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:34,140
It's going so deep. First of all I'm-

954
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:38,380
I need to like- I'm about to- I can see there's a wall right there.

955
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:55,420
Well there's iron. Thankfully. I made it. I'm at the bottom of the world.

956
02:08:55,420 --> 02:09:19,689
Yeah you can't dig through this right? I don't have an iron pickaxe.

957
02:09:19,689 --> 02:09:28,359
Fuck. Smell the iron? All right yeah. Good idea.

958
02:09:28,359 --> 02:10:24,060
Okay. Iron. All right here we go. Tools.

959
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:28,329
Why do I have these shorts on? Can we move on from the shorts?

960
02:10:28,329 --> 02:10:37,979
Can we get away from the shorts here? I need-

961
02:10:37,979 --> 02:10:48,149
I need a pickaxe for that. Do that right now.

962
02:10:48,229 --> 02:11:01,140
One, two, three, and then here we go. I need a shovel. No I don't.

963
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:12,380
Um what's that? Armor? I'm gonna do a helmet

964
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:22,149
or a shield. How do we make a shield? I've never seen that before. I've never

965
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:34,409
made one. The shield is 10 shovels. 10 above

966
02:11:34,409 --> 02:11:39,850
bedrock. Just open the green book. Ooh.

967
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:48,489
Isn't that fancy? So it's planks and then an iron

968
02:11:48,489 --> 02:12:17,640
bar. Okay let's make it. Okay. Shield.

969
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:37,449
Now let's make helmet. Suit up. Yep. Helmet and we're gonna do with five.

970
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:54,710
Can I do anything with five? Boots. Things are looking up.

971
02:12:54,710 --> 02:12:59,590
Things are looking up. I got a full chicken here. All right let's get out

972
02:12:59,590 --> 02:13:10,250
of this. Boots. Helmet. Shield.

973
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:19,239
Shield. This shield. This is a cutting board.

974
02:13:19,239 --> 02:13:26,250
Is this a stamp? How am I supposed to hold it like this?

975
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:34,869
I feel like this is an old-fashioned flash photography ball.

976
02:13:41,319 --> 02:13:47,060
All right that's pretty cool. Put these torches back

977
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:53,739
and I'm good. Get the shovel down there.

978
02:13:53,739 --> 02:13:59,800
I'm ready. I'm ready. I think I'm ready. Am I ready?

979
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:06,380
Block arrows with the shield. Nice. Make an iron bow. God damn it is what

980
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:13,850
they said. I can't. I don't have enough. I don't

981
02:14:13,850 --> 02:14:20,789
have enough. I can't do it. Shears or flint and steel. That's

982
02:14:20,789 --> 02:14:28,729
not real. I'm ready. I got chicken. I got my

983
02:14:28,729 --> 02:14:31,930
sword. Is that this blocks my whole inventory?

984
02:14:31,930 --> 02:15:00,140
All right I'm ready for minecon. You know what's the what's the chance that

985
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:07,670
there's lava in here? It's pretty high right? No get me

986
02:15:07,670 --> 02:15:10,760
the fuck out of here. Get me out of this. I'm not doing

987
02:15:10,760 --> 02:15:49,220
this. Okay safe. All right I'm good. Let's get the

988
02:15:49,220 --> 02:16:02,340
hell out of here. I'm gonna go like up that way. Oh

989
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:12,979
god damn it. Okay um I'm gonna poke a hole in the

990
02:16:12,979 --> 02:16:16,899
walls and I'm so paranoid about lava now after that happening before.

991
02:16:16,899 --> 02:16:23,829
I'm just gonna stand up and like poke fucking holes in the walls.

992
02:16:23,829 --> 02:16:30,539
Clear a nice section here. I'm also not going to use this

993
02:16:30,539 --> 02:16:35,180
for just this bullshit. I'm gonna use this. It's a waste of resources.

994
02:16:35,180 --> 02:17:00,459
All right let's switch back. Nice. What am I gonna do with this stuff?

995
02:17:00,459 --> 02:17:15,059
It's not like it matters. I'm not gonna spend like all day in here.

996
02:17:15,059 --> 02:17:42,170
Okay don't do that either. Right that's bad too. That's just as bad as

997
02:17:42,170 --> 02:18:08,420
going down. What's going on up there? Nothing.

998
02:18:08,420 --> 02:18:44,340
Okay it's safe. Kind of. Kind of safe. All right am I- I'm on the diamond level

999
02:18:44,340 --> 02:19:02,739
right? Down here. What the fuck was that?

1000
02:19:02,739 --> 02:19:11,750
What the hell just- is that ASCII in 2019?

1001
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:21,620
Oh wait have we got Justin TV? Oh is it Justin.tv or are we Twitch now?

1002
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:33,750
Okay I'm ready. I'm gonna go this way. I'm at the diamond level.

1003
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:37,370
Is it all I need? Is it all I want? I just want to get it and I want to

1004
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:40,250
make a diamond sword in the diamond pickaxe and that's it. And then I'm

1005
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:45,850
done. And then I could say I've done it all.

1006
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:52,809
I've done it all. I've traveled to Japan. I've been to

1007
02:19:52,809 --> 02:19:56,489
France. I fucking- I fucking have a giant

1008
02:19:56,489 --> 02:19:59,850
empire of merchandising right? I sold like fucking

1009
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:05,799
422 shirts. Empire. I played Minecraft VR got diamonds.

1010
02:20:05,799 --> 02:20:29,059
It's more than that by the way. No wrong. Can you imagine

1011
02:20:29,059 --> 02:20:33,180
running a fucking empire clothing company?

1012
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:40,700
What's your day-to-day life like? Do you like hold up shirts and you're like

1013
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:56,309
ah it sucks and you like tell them to start over?

1014
02:20:56,309 --> 02:21:26,700
Come on Minecraft. Where the hell are the diamonds? Press

1015
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:31,819
F3 and see if you are at level 16 or below.

1016
02:21:31,819 --> 02:21:47,129
Um I- I can't do that right now. Iron. I might be able to make some more

1017
02:21:47,129 --> 02:22:02,469
stuff. Maybe a blouse. Maybe a t-shirt. Is

1018
02:22:02,469 --> 02:22:12,420
that it for- give me like a diamond patch.

1019
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:17,940
That's all I want. I don't care. I don't even know how to get back to my

1020
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:22,069
house. Do you think I care about what's going on at my

1021
02:22:22,069 --> 02:22:28,420
residence right now? No. That- but it wasn't even a house.

1022
02:22:28,420 --> 02:22:32,500
This is weird. Why is this here? This is dirt.

1023
02:22:32,500 --> 02:23:05,430
Okay. I got a straight shot. Is dirt this low?

1024
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:50,219
Why is there dirt down here? Okay. I think we're good.

1025
02:23:50,219 --> 02:24:15,879
I'm so confused. Why is this here? Oh my god. Eat.

1026
02:24:15,879 --> 02:25:04,569
Eat. Eat. Eat. Eat. That's pretty good. Yeah!

1027
02:25:04,569 --> 02:25:16,680
Resident Slaver. What is this? What does that look different?

1028
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:20,280
All right. I'm out of here. I'm done. I'm just gonna do it or I'm just gonna

1029
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:28,100
smelt it right now. I'm not waiting. There. Eight diamonds.

1030
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:40,040
Look at those diamond eggs. And put that down.

1031
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:59,299
64 redstone. Put it in there. Uh diamond axe. That's not what I want.

1032
02:25:59,299 --> 02:26:06,899
Diamond pickaxe. Got it. There it is.

1033
02:26:06,899 --> 02:26:37,899
Diamond sword. Diamond hoe. There it is. And she built. Yeah everyone's

1034
02:26:37,899 --> 02:26:48,069
talking shit. You talking shit about my fucking gonzo blade?

1035
02:26:48,069 --> 02:26:59,500
I did it. All right. I beat Minecraft. That was fun.

1036
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:14,010
I didn't get like- I didn't use my diamond sword though. I can't just

1037
02:27:14,010 --> 02:27:21,260
not- I can't just give up now. Diamond sword. Look how fast it is.

1038
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:26,340
What about it in real time? Way better.

1039
02:27:26,340 --> 02:27:55,299
You gotta be close though. That's the only thing. In before lava.

1040
02:27:55,299 --> 02:27:58,579
Uh I'm gonna be some position. I can just run that way.

1041
02:27:58,579 --> 02:28:30,180
I want to find a cave system. This is dark. This is really fun though.

1042
02:28:30,180 --> 02:28:38,229
This is a whole other way to experience playing this game.

1043
02:28:38,229 --> 02:28:48,260
In three dimensions. Uh what's that? Houston.

1044
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:56,659
We've got a cave. Where is it? Was it this way?

1045
02:28:56,659 --> 02:29:21,129
So one person said yes. I listen to you. To heal. I got full health.

1046
02:29:21,129 --> 02:29:33,290
We're not only supposed to play this for an hour. Well I did have to

1047
02:29:33,290 --> 02:29:43,899
get diamonds. How long have I been playing this? Did I

1048
02:29:43,899 --> 02:29:55,500
just lose track of all time? It's almost three hours. Holy shit.

1049
02:29:55,500 --> 02:29:59,510
I'm- I am just me and I'm enjoying myself.

1050
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:06,860
I'm gonna have to wake up a little bit though for the next uh game that's

1051
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:22,409
coming up here in a minute once I find uh anything.

1052
02:30:22,409 --> 02:30:29,110
Is it- is it- no I'm safe. I'm safe. It's fine.

1053
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:36,459
Everything's fine. It's right here. It's this block right here.

1054
02:30:36,459 --> 02:30:39,579
Come on kid. We gotta get out of here.

1055
02:30:41,049 --> 02:30:48,680
What does the Indiana Jones say? I'm surrounded by lava.

1056
02:30:48,680 --> 02:31:47,020
It's all here. Good thing. Good thing. I think it's actually up there. Stop.

1057
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:56,540
I hear noises. I can hear skeletons and shit.

1058
02:31:56,540 --> 02:32:18,299
Where are they? There's lava somewhere over here.

1059
02:32:18,299 --> 02:32:20,540
They might be in like three or four different places. I think they're above

1060
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:39,670
me. There's something above me. All right. I'm a safe place. That would

1061
02:32:39,670 --> 02:33:21,350
have been fucking really bad. Really? Where are these?

1062
02:33:22,409 --> 02:34:31,899
To the right. Okay. Found it. How big is this? This is gonna

1063
02:34:31,899 --> 02:34:34,940
lead to a bunch bigger system right? The lava's flowing this way.

1064
02:34:34,940 --> 02:35:10,729
Does that mean anything? Oh it is still here okay.

1065
02:35:10,729 --> 02:35:17,670
I'm playing with fire here like actually. Am I trying to make this hard

1066
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:40,579
on myself? I need a light. Come on give me- leave

1067
02:35:40,579 --> 02:36:02,420
me somewhere. Leave me somewhere. It ends. I- I'm

1068
02:36:02,420 --> 02:36:14,180
getting out of here. I have to leave. I gotta- I'm leaving. How on earth am I

1069
02:36:14,180 --> 02:36:27,399
gonna navigate my way out of here? I'm not gonna dig up into lava. If I do

1070
02:36:27,399 --> 02:36:41,659
I can make a run for it. That looks all right.

1071
02:36:41,659 --> 02:36:54,700
We're safe. We're safe for now. Oh come on.

1072
02:36:54,700 --> 02:37:04,920
Give me something. I hear water. I don't think I want that to happen.

1073
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:16,329
I might just turn around and go the other way. This means that this-

1074
02:37:16,329 --> 02:37:36,700
they're waterlogged right? Okay. Safe. Safe. Let's keep looking.

1075
02:37:36,700 --> 02:38:08,629
There's a spider. That means that there has to be land. Where's the spider?

1076
02:38:08,629 --> 02:38:19,690
Something going on up there. Water? Is there water up there?

1077
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:39,879
I still hear the spider. I should be fine.

1078
02:38:39,879 --> 02:39:02,840
All right this- oh my god. Get rid of this.

1079
02:39:02,840 --> 02:39:10,229
I have so much cobblestone. It's like someone hasn't been paying attention

1080
02:39:10,229 --> 02:39:44,069
right? Something up here. Getting closer.

1081
02:39:44,069 --> 02:40:11,559
I'm gonna open up what- and there's gonna be just a window of somebody's

1082
02:40:11,559 --> 02:40:18,409
face. This might be water right here.

1083
02:40:18,409 --> 02:40:41,399
I actually have to be very careful about this. Did I just punch somebody?

1084
02:40:41,479 --> 02:41:03,860
What? I'm very confused. I don't hear anything.

1085
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:23,739
They were right here. It was almost like I was standing right in front of them.

1086
02:41:23,739 --> 02:41:33,559
Anybody got any ideas? All right. No. I gotta stop fucking around. I gotta go.

1087
02:41:33,559 --> 02:41:37,620
I have to go up. We're just going up. If I die, I die.

1088
02:41:37,620 --> 02:42:00,420
It's all right. I'm over a cave somehow. I should have enough time to

1089
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:15,459
run if there's something horrible right there.

1090
02:42:19,219 --> 02:42:33,770
Okay. I ain't even dealing with you at all.

1091
02:42:33,770 --> 02:43:10,360
What are you doing? Oh. Oops. Did I just sneak around them?

1092
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:36,600
I mean I know this. I don't know what I'm stepping on. No.

1093
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:47,690
I can just go all the way around them. They cannot fit through that.

1094
02:43:47,690 --> 02:43:55,450
There's not somebody behind me. You have to be right here.

1095
02:43:55,450 --> 02:44:51,959
He's like right in front of my face. Jesus.

1096
02:44:51,959 --> 02:45:25,180
Goddamn diamond pit gas! What's this thing even worth? Come on.

1097
02:45:25,180 --> 02:45:32,520
Get down here.

1098
02:45:33,579 --> 02:45:50,620
What the fuck are they all doing here? What the fuck are you doing here?

1099
02:45:51,659 --> 02:45:55,959
There's one of those spawners up here, ain't there? I gotta eat.

1100
02:45:55,959 --> 02:46:08,229
Do I have any more food? This sucks. Okay. There's a

1101
02:46:08,229 --> 02:46:35,530
bow and arrow. Why did that not block it? Why did that not block?

1102
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:41,510
It went through the shield. I'm gonna die. I need to eat again.

1103
02:46:41,510 --> 02:46:52,489
What's happening with food? How do I throw these away?

1104
02:46:52,489 --> 02:47:53,270
I don't want them in here. No! Don't touch. Don't. I made it. I think I've

1105
02:47:53,270 --> 02:48:04,459
been here. Have I been here before? I don't think.

1106
02:48:04,459 --> 02:48:44,180
No. I haven't. I think there's another one. Oh.

1107
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:59,819
No. Not deep. I don't want to go deeper. Oh my god. This looks like.

1108
02:48:59,819 --> 02:49:03,100
This looks like man. This looks man-made. This looks man-made.

1109
02:49:03,100 --> 02:49:11,850
I think this is man-made. It's man-made. Is that man-made?

1110
02:49:11,850 --> 02:50:03,940
What? There's no more lava to worry about down here.

1111
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:32,299
We'll be fine. Almost there. Almost there. Then I mean on

1112
02:50:32,299 --> 02:51:14,440
water. Get down! All right. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1113
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:20,040
I, I, I'm fine. I have no idea. I have no idea what's going on with the back of my

1114
02:51:20,040 --> 02:51:26,229
head. What happened? What is it? What's,

1115
02:51:26,229 --> 02:51:39,860
what is this? Why is it doing this? I'm cheating right

1116
02:51:39,860 --> 02:51:57,739
now with my left eye. What's, what's going on? Is this going

1117
02:51:57,739 --> 02:52:24,010
down? What's this connected to? The cord is all the way up here.

1118
02:52:24,010 --> 02:52:34,090
What the fuck is this mess? How am I gonna get rid of this?

1119
02:52:34,090 --> 02:52:41,219
It was yanking me on the back of the head. Oh this is, this

1120
02:52:41,219 --> 02:52:50,549
is gonna take like 20 minutes to get out of this. I've been spinning around

1121
02:52:50,549 --> 02:53:05,219
that much. What was that? What was that? Why did

1122
02:53:05,219 --> 02:53:09,940
my house just fall down? Like what was that like crashing wood sound?

1123
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:30,620
Where am I? Did I pull the cord out? I think I may have pulled a cord out.

1124
02:53:30,620 --> 02:54:02,469
Okay. Oh my lord. There's real tension here. I have to, I got to fix that

1125
02:54:02,469 --> 02:54:09,829
before we play another game. All right. What the hell happened?

1126
02:54:09,829 --> 02:54:27,479
Why am I, why is it just black? Am I a lot? I'm inside the wall. Okay

1127
02:54:27,479 --> 02:55:01,579
let's go back up. Am I dying? Come on. Go. Get up there.

1128
02:55:01,579 --> 02:55:18,790
Oh no. Where's my house? What's one of the four

1129
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:57,100
horsemen doing here? What? What is that? That's rare?

1130
02:55:57,100 --> 02:56:08,500
What the fuck? Should I like go back and kill it?

1131
02:56:08,500 --> 02:56:14,299
It's split into, I don't even know where I am, where this is.

1132
02:56:14,299 --> 02:56:19,020
All right hold on. Let me take a look for a second. So

1133
02:56:19,020 --> 02:56:45,829
that's the creeper island. Is it that way? I don't know where my house is.

1134
02:56:45,829 --> 02:57:00,870
Where the hell was that? Maybe back, I think it was back here.

1135
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:21,739
Down there. There he is. There he is. There they are. There they are. What do I do

1136
02:57:21,739 --> 02:57:46,139
about this? How do I do this? Okay. I'm gonna, what do I do? Run, grab stuff,

1137
02:57:46,139 --> 02:57:50,440
and then leave. I've got, I've got a diamond sword.

1138
02:57:50,440 --> 02:57:55,579
I have to at least try. Are there four of them?

1139
02:57:55,579 --> 02:58:15,100
What is he wearing on his head? What? There's a giant sea turtle?

1140
02:58:15,100 --> 02:58:20,600
Hello. You can, can you ride, you can, you can ride his back can't you?

1141
02:58:20,680 --> 02:58:33,110
Of course you can. No you can't. Where's my stuff?

1142
02:58:33,110 --> 02:59:27,020
You can't go in water right? No you can't. Come on you son of a bitch let's go.

1143
02:59:27,020 --> 02:59:59,860
Did you get everything? Most of it. Oh shit.

1144
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:15,239
Damn. Gotta kill a fish and eat. Come here.

1145
03:00:15,239 --> 03:00:26,059
Should I try to go over that guy? Should I try to kill him? If I have full health

1146
03:00:26,059 --> 03:00:48,870
and it's just one, can I just bash his head in? I need more fish.

1147
03:00:48,870 --> 03:00:57,750
I'm going for him. Maybe if it's only one.

1148
03:00:57,750 --> 03:01:11,700
Oh fuck that's one of them. All right give me some more food.

1149
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:21,979
Mind the like eyes of being blocked by my hair.

1150
03:01:21,979 --> 03:01:25,979
Don't I, I don't think I have one of those damn things.

1151
03:01:25,979 --> 03:02:01,559
No what are you doing? Give me the food. I want the food.

1152
03:02:01,559 --> 03:02:07,639
Ah. I'm gonna start healing now right? Good.

1153
03:02:07,639 --> 03:02:14,659
I'm gonna go after the ones over here. I feel like I can do it.

1154
03:02:14,659 --> 03:02:17,299
Because I had, there was like four of them at the same time. So that's why I

1155
03:02:17,299 --> 03:02:27,139
couldn't do anything about it before. Let me get some more food. Give it to

1156
03:02:27,139 --> 03:03:09,559
the boy. Oh my god I'm just hungry. I'm starving

1157
03:03:09,559 --> 03:03:35,659
the whole time. No. Give it. Am I supposed to go make

1158
03:03:35,659 --> 03:03:53,379
this food? I'm wasting so much time. They'll be there. See if I can get

1159
03:03:53,379 --> 03:04:10,090
this little school of fish. I got three.

1160
03:04:10,090 --> 03:04:17,610
Okay I'm good. Whatever. Just go. Back home.

1161
03:04:17,610 --> 03:04:27,459
Store the other shit that I have. Hey look I got another one.

1162
03:04:27,459 --> 03:04:35,139
Didn't even need to do anything. This makes me want to pick up

1163
03:04:35,139 --> 03:04:43,860
Minecraft again. Good way to de-stress. Yeah I know this is fun.

1164
03:04:43,860 --> 03:04:50,979
Get it. Don't let it just sit there. I would have moved on already.

1165
03:04:50,979 --> 03:04:56,729
But I'm just, I'm gonna do it. Might as well just do it.

1166
03:04:56,729 --> 03:05:03,030
Spend at least a few hours in here. Seems like they added a lot of

1167
03:05:03,030 --> 03:05:06,500
interesting stuff. That's the coolest part. Am I even

1168
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:09,059
talking? I am. Weirdly enough I'm talking

1169
03:05:09,059 --> 03:05:15,059
right in the right direction. The last time I really gave any

1170
03:05:15,059 --> 03:05:18,979
care at all about this game. Had to have been at least four or five

1171
03:05:18,979 --> 03:05:22,020
years ago. I really wasn't into it that much

1172
03:05:22,020 --> 03:05:25,700
anyways. But coming back after all these years.

1173
03:05:25,700 --> 03:05:31,430
Hold that thought. There he goes. Coming back after all the years it just

1174
03:05:31,430 --> 03:05:34,549
seems like, like the sea turtles in the game.

1175
03:05:34,549 --> 03:05:37,590
That's odd. That's equally parts interesting and

1176
03:05:37,590 --> 03:05:41,590
like wow I'm surprised that they're still adding content to the game.

1177
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:49,270
All right where where's my house? There it is.

1178
03:05:49,270 --> 03:06:03,819
This many years later. Is this a copy pasta?

1179
03:06:03,819 --> 03:06:24,500
It is now three hours in Minecraft. I'm surprised. Let me just fix this.

1180
03:06:24,500 --> 03:06:28,020
I'll go try to kill him and then we'll move on after that.

1181
03:06:28,020 --> 03:06:37,659
Let's eat. Get my shit together and I'm just gonna go

1182
03:06:37,659 --> 03:06:48,649
put up my hand. Oh all right. Food. I still got the shield still.

1183
03:06:48,649 --> 03:06:52,729
I can make some more armor which is good.

1184
03:06:52,729 --> 03:06:59,620
I don't think I have any. No god damn it.

1185
03:06:59,620 --> 03:07:04,870
I don't have any uh anything to make to burn this

1186
03:07:04,870 --> 03:07:11,940
oak. I have to use my like trees. I have wood yeah.

1187
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:26,709
I don't have very much of it though. I need to make

1188
03:07:26,709 --> 03:07:35,799
look I have 23 iron ore. I might as well just get decked out.

1189
03:07:35,799 --> 03:07:39,559
Are they gonna despawn? Do I have to run back there quick?

1190
03:07:39,559 --> 03:07:51,610
They do so I gotta get the hell back there. I don't have time then.

1191
03:07:51,610 --> 03:07:54,329
Just put on. I got my clothes on right. I just gotta go over there and start

1192
03:07:54,329 --> 03:08:16,260
whacking them. My shield. Put it on. Armor.

1193
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:23,180
There's no time. There's no time. He's there. This is the thing. They despawn.

1194
03:08:23,180 --> 03:08:26,219
One right there. One right there. I think there's another one. Let me get

1195
03:08:26,219 --> 03:08:44,940
a better view. Look at this one. What is that?

1196
03:08:44,940 --> 03:09:09,739
What is that? An Enderman. Right. Don't you need to look at them?

1197
03:09:09,739 --> 03:09:15,450
Wasn't I looking at them? Or are you not supposed to look at them?

1198
03:09:15,450 --> 03:09:21,379
It's one of those two. Don't look. I thought you were supposed to look.

1199
03:09:21,379 --> 03:09:25,059
Right. He came across the whole game. All right.

1200
03:09:25,059 --> 03:09:39,879
You. Is he still gonna be up there? Give me my stuff back.

1201
03:09:39,879 --> 03:10:06,309
Where's my sword? I have an arrow in the back of my head.

1202
03:10:06,309 --> 03:10:17,319
Just eat the raw salmon. Just twice. I don't care.

1203
03:10:17,319 --> 03:11:00,120
Whatever happens. Whatever happens happens. I'm going to

1204
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:04,469
practice. I hear an explosion. All right. I'm going in.

1205
03:11:04,469 --> 03:11:24,139
Here we go. Where is he? Here we go. Through the trees. Through the bushes.

1206
03:11:24,139 --> 03:12:45,670
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Good luck. I'm killing this one.

1207
03:12:45,670 --> 03:13:58,200
Where is he? Where is he? Motherfucker. Where'd he go?

1208
03:13:58,200 --> 03:15:04,860
Shit. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

1209
03:15:04,860 --> 03:16:02,459
Oh fuck. Shit. Motherfucker. Did I do it? Did I do it? I think I

1210
03:16:02,459 --> 03:16:19,930
No. He jumped up. You already. You saw what happened. I don't need to explain it.

1211
03:16:19,930 --> 03:16:28,819
I gotta use the shield. When I used the shield last time, I just fucking killed me.

1212
03:16:28,819 --> 03:16:32,180
Oh, give me my stuff back. I'm blocking a minute. I had it.

1213
03:16:32,819 --> 03:16:40,250
I'm so upset right now. His body got up on the.

1214
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:50,340
His body got up on the thing that I put up and he gave the perfect headshot.

1215
03:16:51,059 --> 03:16:57,370
That was it too. That was the one. I'm so sad about this. Look at that mess.

1216
03:16:58,170 --> 03:17:01,670
What am I doing? It's not funny. What are you doing?

1217
03:17:02,709 --> 03:17:07,610
I can still do it. Fuck food. Fuck everything. I'm gonna get up there.

1218
03:17:07,610 --> 03:17:32,420
I'm gonna get. Oh no. Don't look at me like that.

1219
03:17:32,420 --> 03:17:35,940
Okay. Here we go. I gotta make this jump. It's gonna be worth it.

1220
03:17:36,819 --> 03:17:40,120
I didn't fucking even jump. Un-fucking-believable. Video game.

1221
03:17:46,180 --> 03:17:51,860
Why didn't I jump? He's just perfect. He's perfect.

1222
03:17:53,860 --> 03:17:56,979
The cord is. I don't even. The cord is part of me now.

1223
03:18:03,379 --> 03:18:09,260
It's that. I did it. I did that. Where is he? Down here? He's right there.

1224
03:18:19,719 --> 03:18:25,219
Okay. I can do it with dirt. I'm trying this one more time.

1225
03:18:25,860 --> 03:18:50,260
Can I get my shoe? Nope. You have boots though. Here we go.

1226
03:18:50,260 --> 03:18:52,809
All right. Fuck you. Now you're dead.

1227
03:19:29,959 --> 03:19:46,340
Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Come on. It's right there. Get it.

1228
03:19:46,340 --> 03:20:00,579
Why can't I place the block? Stop. What the fuck is happening, Vi?

1229
03:20:00,579 --> 03:20:16,920
I gotta get on the other side. Oh, it's so hard to see.

1230
03:20:16,920 --> 03:20:22,920
You're looking far that. When I put my head down,

1231
03:20:22,920 --> 03:20:28,940
everything is blurred. Everything. It's so difficult to look down in any VR game.

1232
03:20:29,500 --> 03:21:43,579
I'm still alive? I got a better fucking idea.

1233
03:21:43,579 --> 03:21:50,100
Don't. Stop running. That's gonna drive me crazy.

1234
03:22:05,610 --> 03:22:15,670
Why do you keep doing that? I feel like I'm playing Fortnite.

1235
03:22:15,670 --> 03:22:18,729
This is just Fortnite. I'm playing Fortnite.

1236
03:22:18,729 --> 03:22:21,760
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill. Bob 06

1237
03:22:21,760 --> 03:22:47,540
Come down here. Do it. I'm setting a goddamn looting tunes track for you.

1238
03:22:47,540 --> 03:23:09,319
You coming?

1239
03:23:09,319 --> 03:23:14,389
Get in right here and then I'm gonna go bang, bang.

1240
03:23:24,489 --> 03:23:26,329
I'm gonna fucking scream in a second.

1241
03:23:26,329 --> 03:24:10,090
Okay, hold on. I gotta plan this. Get in here.

1242
03:24:11,450 --> 03:24:11,930
Come on.

1243
03:24:11,930 --> 03:24:29,139
Look, I'm over here. I'm right here. Don't you see me? Hey, hey, where is he? Where'd he go?

1244
03:24:29,139 --> 03:24:54,219
Oh, that's fine, that's fine. Stay there. Stay there. Right there. Anything else blocking his way?

1245
03:24:54,219 --> 03:25:18,450
You can't get in there! You can't fit in there. He needs two blocks. I don't have...

1246
03:25:18,450 --> 03:25:41,579
He's never gonna fucking get in here. He's never gonna go like this. Is he in? Is he in? Is he in?

1247
03:25:41,579 --> 03:25:45,350
Oh my god, oh my god. Don't move. Nobody move. Nobody fucking breathe. Don't breathe.

1248
03:25:45,350 --> 03:25:50,500
Nobody breathe. Nobody breathe. Nobody breathe. Don't breathe. Can you hear me talking?

1249
03:25:50,500 --> 03:26:05,829
I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got this motherfucker. He's done.

1250
03:26:05,829 --> 03:26:14,319
I got him. I got him. I actually got him. I trapped him. I trapped him! I did it!

1251
03:26:14,319 --> 03:26:40,729
Wait, what about over here? Stop it, Vibe. No, it's so dark. Oh my god, I hate this thing.

1252
03:26:40,729 --> 03:26:48,690
Get better goddamn technology for Christ's sake. It's cuz I'm putting my hand over my head.

1253
03:26:48,969 --> 03:27:10,809
Because I'm blind when I go like this. Is he in? Is he in? I can't tell. No, he's not.

1254
03:27:10,809 --> 03:27:17,920
The horse is dead. What? What do you mean the horse is friendly? What do you mean he's dead?

1255
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:39,979
The rider is dead. So I can... Horse is not harmful. You sure? Oh man, are you sure about that?

1256
03:27:39,979 --> 03:28:01,729
So what do I do? What can I do? Oh wow. What happened? What happened? What happened again?

1257
03:28:02,049 --> 03:28:10,299
Goddamn better technology, I swear to god. What happened? I can't even... I didn't touch anything.

1258
03:28:10,299 --> 03:28:17,190
How would I suffocate in a wall? I didn't do anything. What happened? I gotta get back here now.

1259
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:21,549
Why can I not touch any fucking thing on the screen? What? Why didn't it minimize the window?

1260
03:28:21,549 --> 03:28:38,690
I'm getting this fucking lobster, whatever it is. Quickly. Where is this way? Over here.

1261
03:28:38,690 --> 03:29:10,389
He's gonna get back over here. He's still there. We're fine. Slow down.

1262
03:29:11,270 --> 03:29:21,190
You guys are still questioning his sanity. So what can I do with this animal?

1263
03:29:22,149 --> 03:29:31,340
So, okay, I have... Do I, like, touch him? Can I pet him? How do I do this? Tame it.

1264
03:29:33,110 --> 03:29:46,809
Break the blocks. I need a saddle. Break roof. Break all the blocks. They're tamed.

1265
03:29:46,809 --> 03:30:05,989
Need a saddle. Break the blocks above him. Like up here. I don't need a saddle. Oh,

1266
03:30:06,149 --> 03:30:17,799
so much information. Touch him with an empty hand. The dirt blocks. That's wood. Like these.

1267
03:30:22,760 --> 03:30:45,829
Why do I need to get rid of those? What's he doing? Now ride it. What? Does he have a mind

1268
03:30:45,829 --> 03:31:00,379
of his own? I don't even have any items. I can't get out of here. What about my... What? No,

1269
03:31:00,379 --> 03:31:07,110
no, no, no. Don't do that again. This way. Out here. Wait, how do I get off? Grab

1270
03:31:07,110 --> 03:31:18,420
these shit. How do I jump off? How do you get off? Jump. I can't jump. I can't get off of

1271
03:31:22,700 --> 03:31:42,139
left shift. Okay, I got my sword. Okay, I'm ready. So, where do we go? That... I almost threw up

1272
03:31:42,139 --> 03:31:49,799
from that. I almost just fell down. Okay, I don't like how he moves out of his own.

1273
03:31:49,799 --> 03:32:13,479
How do I tell him to go? Go! Go! I need a saddle. What's going on with the world?

1274
03:32:20,329 --> 03:32:38,260
Oh, stop doing that. All right, do something! Can I... Will he go anywhere? Now you're

1275
03:32:38,260 --> 03:33:08,569
going to leave. You're a real... He's pointing at him. What happened to that guy? All right,

1276
03:33:08,569 --> 03:33:17,700
I need a saddle. Where's the crafting book? Saddle. How do I get him to come with me? Will

1277
03:33:17,700 --> 03:33:32,020
he come with me? Like, craft a lead and take him home. Oh, I need to find a saddle.

1278
03:33:34,090 --> 03:33:55,899
Oh, well, this was cool. At least I got to see it. Bye! Be free! Just spawn a saddle.

1279
03:33:55,899 --> 03:34:07,260
I... I don't... I... Pet the turtle. That was outrageous. Look, there's another one.

1280
03:34:11,459 --> 03:34:18,780
Well, that was cool. I gotta take a break. I gotta go get... I gotta go get a fucking drink.

1281
03:34:19,739 --> 03:34:27,399
That last 30 minutes kind of just killed me. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'll be right back.

1282
03:34:27,959 --> 03:34:34,739
Water. And I'm not even talking in the right direction. That's the rarest horse in the game.

1283
03:34:35,299 --> 03:34:42,379
At least I got to ride it. I got to ride it for at least a second. I got to put the coin

1284
03:34:42,379 --> 03:34:47,899
in in front of the fucking Walmart. All right, I'll be right back. We'll do another one.
