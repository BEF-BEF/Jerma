Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and today I have some Hitman, the Blood Money.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
And today I want to play this game because Hitman Absolution, the sequel to this, is coming out pretty soon.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,800
So I want to just show you my special techniques and how I take out the bad guys.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,799
So this is the Vineyard level, and this is the guy we're going to kill right here, right by the door.

5
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,799
So this is a good technique. What you want to do is you pull out the mine.

6
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,799
And who gives a shit about these people running around? You just want to drop it in...

7
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,799
Where is he? I think he's right here.

8
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,799
Drop the landmine, take a little stroll over here, pull out the detonator, and see you later, motherfuckers!

9
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:53,869
What an explosion that was!

10
00:00:53,869 --> 00:01:02,869
This is the guy. Oh. Well, I killed him anyway, so if you don't kill him with the blast, then just... Jesus, that was rough.

11
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:11,939
Also, this game is all about stealth. You want to be really quiet, and you want to use a syringe to make sure you put the people to sleep and not kill them.

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,939
Hey! What are you doing? Don't shoot it!

13
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,939
Don't shoot it!

14
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,939
Okay, let's try this again. Pull out the mine, everybody run scared.

15
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,939
Yeah, yeah, get the fuck out of my way. I don't want to deal with every inch.

16
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,939
Drop the mine, come on, come on, come on! I've never done this before! Come on!

17
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,939
Yes! I did it! I actually did it! Okay, now I...

18
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,939
I don't know what to do now. That's the first time I've ever done that.

19
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,939
Oh, okay, pull out the machine gun.

20
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,939
I don't know what to do! I don't have any bullets left! This is stupid!

21
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,939
Okay, I just, um... think here, grandpa. Come on, think!

22
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,939
I'm going to just... Oh my God, grab a gun! Grab somebody's gun!

23
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,939
Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?

24
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,250
Okay, so I've come to the realization that you're not supposed to use the mine.

25
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,250
So I'm just going to drop it at the beginning of the level so nobody sees it and I don't get in any trouble.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,549
And then... What? What? What?

27
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,789
Why did that guy just pick up the mine?

28
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,969
Hold on a second, what is this guy doing?

29
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,969
Excuse me, you just picked up a fucking mine!

30
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:23,969
So this is hands down one of the weirdest things that's ever goddamn happened to me in a video game.

31
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,969
So this guy has the mine, can I blow him up?

32
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:30,460
Can I detonate this guy in this entire goddamn room? Are you serious?

33
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:38,199
You know, typically I would laugh at something like this, but that was just sad.
