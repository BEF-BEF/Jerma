1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:07,929
Okay, what else do we have to finish up?

2
00:00:07,929 --> 00:00:16,730
Hide behind the table in the camera room?

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,410
Uh, uh, no.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,600
Why do you have a filter on?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,199
Why don't I just turn the gamma down?

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,359
Do Breath of the Wild?

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,609
No, I'd rather, I don't want to start that now.

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,010
What can I do for the next like 30 minutes?

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,899
What do you think?

10
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,820
I thought, I got a couple other games.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:44,939
Let me see, what else do I have here?

12
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,780
Five Nights at Freddy's.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,070
Okay, fine.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,710
I will do...

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,219
No, I'm not playing that.

16
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm not playing Five Nights at Freddy's.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,540
Because I'm gonna have to do Night 1 again and like that's...

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,219
I don't want to sit through Night 1.

19
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:18,579
Please, do you really want me to play Five Nights at Freddy's?

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:28,459
Five Nights at Freddy's, it's Freddy's 2.

21
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:32,219
Okay, so I want a poll for me to play Five Nights at Freddy's 2.

22
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,269
And it has to be at least 75%.

23
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:41,060
And I'll do it right now.

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:47,459
What about Faith?

25
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,819
I do have Faith, but I feel like it's too late to start it.

26
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,409
I would come back and play it.

27
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,700
Five Nights at Freddy's 2, yeah.

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,829
I would play that next week.

29
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,349
Just because it's not Halloween anymore doesn't mean I can't play them.

30
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:14,840
Five Nights at Freddy's 2, it's gonna be at least 75%.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,979
I don't think this is gonna win.

32
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:29,370
Judging by the preliminary amount here.

33
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,569
That's the best one?

34
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,009
Yeah, I think it probably is.

35
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,539
Let me see if I can help you guys.

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,780
Vote for it.

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,819
Let's make it happen.

38
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,259
I want to see 75%.

39
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm not sure it's even gonna get there.

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,449
What was the other one?

41
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,139
Hold on.

42
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,539
I swear I had another couple of games that I wanted to do.

43
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:05,990
I don't think it's gonna make it.

44
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,270
He wants to play it so bad.

45
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,030
I have like the other Dread X Collection stuff.

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,599
Let's do that.

47
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,120
What about Dread X Collection 5?

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,599
I'll just play a couple of random things.

49
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,479
Yeah, you're not gonna make it.

50
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:25,180
I'm doing Dread X Collection 5.

51
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:34,469
You guys are just not gonna make it.

52
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:35,830
Yeah, I said 75%.

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,629
You didn't get there.

54
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:44,949
Okay, let me capture it.

55
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,939
Video resolution, that's fine.

56
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,659
That's fine.

57
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,620
Field of view is fine.

58
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,580
This is fine.

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,580
Okay, story mode on this?

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,060
Interesting.

61
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,379
This is number five.

62
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:15,580
Story mode.

63
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,589
Strangle man's hunt.

64
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:45,529
Thousand, the place where your party is out of this world.

65
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,149
Locals are celebrating Hanas.

66
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,149
A nightless night and midsummer said to hold magical power.

67
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,430
A ritual must be completed.

68
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,910
The pain whispers in an infamous art gallery

69
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,829
where mysterious disappearances have occurred.

70
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:03,769
The book of blood?

71
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,829
Kareo.

72
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,189
A late night of karaoke.

73
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:12,470
A wrong turn singing.

74
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,910
Where did the train station come from?

75
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,139
Where does it go?

76
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,019
Rotten stigma.

77
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,860
Spirit guardian.

78
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,740
We never left.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,949
Mystige.

80
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,560
Resver- there's a lot in this one.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,759
Beyond the curtain.

82
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,959
All right, what's a good one?

83
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,399
This is collection five.

84
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,779
This one's so good.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,300
Wait, what?

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:54,540
I need to get unlocked.

87
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,079
Error.

88
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,279
Please assemble band before musical performance.

89
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,660
Okay.

90
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,720
Assemble band?

91
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,420
Is every single door stuck?

92
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Is it going to the bathroom?

93
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,759
Gas can is piss.

94
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:50,250
Does that mean that there's piss in the gas can

95
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:59,589
or does that mean someone with my name?

96
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:00,149
What is this?

97
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,279
Can I read it?

98
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,699
No, better than go outside when the besides.

99
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,339
Elvin was too long a child.

100
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:18,220
He hadn't time to be afraid of silly bedtime stories.

101
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,300
Only babies were afraid of the strangle man.

102
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,790
Okay.

103
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,629
Oh, a present.

104
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,300
Take it back to my birthday table to open it.

105
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:49,129
And here we go.

106
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,019
Somebody said this is the best one.

107
00:07:52,019 --> 00:08:08,220
We'll find out.

108
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,370
Finland, June 24th, 1888.

109
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,970
Farmhouses across the nation are preparing

110
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,610
to celebrate the midsummer Yuhannes.

111
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,420
Considered to be a magical night,

112
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,779
many younger folk participate and play

113
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:19,740
for rituals and fun games.

114
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,180
One of these games was called the...

115
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:28,300
It's a black screen.

116
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,860
Huh?

117
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,419
Why is it a black screen?

118
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,019
Hold on.

119
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:42,940
Why can't you see it?

120
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,559
Oh, no.

121
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,580
Weird.

122
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,779
What if I do this?

123
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:58,549
Is that going to do it?

124
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:09,340
I don't think this...

125
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,379
I can't capture this.

126
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:10,700
Why?

127
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,500
That's weird.

128
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:26,519
Can you see it?

129
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:26,759
No.

130
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,460
Yeah, this is with window capture on.

131
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,500
The other one was game capture.

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,779
Now it captured the other game.

133
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:44,340
What if I...

134
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,059
Hold on.

135
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:51,100
That was very strange.

136
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,259
I cannot have it in full screen.

137
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:59,350
So it has to be in a window.

138
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,909
Okay.

139
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,179
That's fine.

140
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:11,580
What the fuck is this?

141
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
I know it's hard.

142
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,620
Dude, what?

143
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,419
What the hell?

144
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:25,269
You can't see it.

145
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,309
You can't see it anymore.

146
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:44,700
Dude, what?

147
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Okay.

148
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,779
Now the game capture works.

149
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,490
I'm going to keep it on this, I guess.

150
00:10:52,490 --> 00:11:00,700
Let's turn off the window capture.

151
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,539
You were the one to blame last year for talking to others.

152
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,100
You were just jealous.

153
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,980
Don't let others blame you.

154
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,549
Try the ritual I told you about.

155
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:13,909
Why don't you try that thing I told you about?

156
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,190
Seven flowers down the well.

157
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,940
I don't believe in these things, but that's how I met your mother.

158
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,419
She's still alive to see what kind of a coward you become.

159
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,779
I can't imagine how hurt she would be.

160
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,899
No, don't even remind me you look like me.

161
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,779
Drop seven flowers into the well and you will see the reflection of your future love.

162
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,029
Though anyone loving you here seems impossible.

163
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,419
Okay.

164
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:13,830
What the fuck are you doing?

165
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,149
What?

166
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:25,769
What the fuck?

167
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,210
Get the fuck off.

168
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,690
What happened last year?

169
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,129
And stay out of everyone's way.

170
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,879
Hannah's is here.

171
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,320
I hope you remember what happened last year.

172
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,279
Stay out of everyone's way.

173
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:49,779
The kids are drinking on the roof so the adults don't notice.

174
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,220
You get the feeling they're planning something.

175
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm getting somebody pissing on me.

176
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,679
I just got pissed on.

177
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,240
I just got somebody peed on me.

178
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,740
Okay.

179
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,950
Okay.

180
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,990
That was interesting.

181
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,519
People tend to whip themselves with it.

182
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,159
Vita, when in sauna, helps you clean your body.

183
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:28,870
Hey, this is not a flower.

184
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:37,879
You!

185
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:42,740
That costume is even better than last year's.

186
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,659
Can't wait to see how the little...

187
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,679
It's mommy time?

188
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,820
Why you didn't run into me?

189
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:59,539
Run up the FOV.

190
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:00,980
Dude, can I?

191
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:02,649
I can't.

192
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:12,519
Celebrate a good harvest.

193
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,000
Dancing around the maypole is said to ensure fertility.

194
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,059
Finland, land of stoic people where every man and woman fends for themselves.

195
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,940
Children learn from a young age to never show their true feelings.

196
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,299
Being different means to be shunned.

197
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,059
You had to learn it the hard way.

198
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,990
Okay, I need to find flowers.

199
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,940
Am I dying?

200
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Guys, I think I'm dying.

201
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,360
Is there a heel?

202
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,809
It's...

203
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:13,769
That pattern's weird.

204
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:21,210
I forgot what it means to be true.

205
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,809
Is there a heel?

206
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:48,820
There has to be a heel somewhere, right?

207
00:15:49,460 --> 00:16:02,730
Hey, look at how fucked up this pattern is.

208
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,029
One...

209
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:05,639
One...

210
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,259
You didn't even make it through that.

211
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:10,899
That's bullshit.

212
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:11,460
They...

213
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,259
That didn't make it through.

214
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,509
Okay, so it's one, two...

215
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,029
When we go, like...

216
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:17,529
Um...

217
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:26,429
Three more?

218
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,590
You can feel it inside you, the true meaning.

219
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,860
No field work.

220
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,269
Okay.

221
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:54,159
Eh.

222
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:01,659
Found this village.

223
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,420
He defended Finland from invading Viking forces with the help of the gods themselves.

224
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,390
Okay.

225
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,359
Get away from me.

226
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,690
What the fuck are you doing here?

227
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,190
What's that?

228
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:28,109
Okay.

229
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:29,930
Hey, everybody.

230
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,089
One of us is in...

231
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:34,809
Y'all know what to do.

232
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:36,809
Get the hud's faulty.

233
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:15,109
Hud's faulty.

234
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:24,079
Suffering.

235
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:29,029
Dude, don't ask me where the other two are.

236
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:30,549
I have no idea.

237
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,240
One more.

238
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:58,390
One more.

239
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,259
Where's the last one?

240
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,319
Ah, where's the last one?

241
00:19:14,039 --> 00:20:11,380
That's it, last one.

242
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,480
I win.

243
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:26,069
Kill them all, my love.

244
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,000
Jesus.

245
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:36,410
All right, I did what you asked.

246
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:49,220
All right, I did it.

247
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,099
Now what?

248
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:06,079
I did it.

249
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:27,430
Stop killing people?

250
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,230
I thought I...

251
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,509
Isn't this how I beat the level?

252
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:40,089
How many people are in here?

253
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:41,930
I need to feed him.

254
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,099
Oh.

255
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,539
You...

256
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
I need to feed this guy?

257
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,640
No, you don't?

258
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,140
Oh, okay.

259
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:07,019
I don't think there's anybody left.

260
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:34,410
Is there somebody else here?

261
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:43,500
Those things?

262
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:52,329
I have to give it to those too?

263
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:59,380
I thought they were...

264
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,900
I thought they were on my side.

265
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,420
Got it.

266
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,440
Just one more thing to do and then we can be together.

267
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:26,359
Go and meet your father.

268
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:27,579
Okay.

269
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:37,769
I'm proud of you, my love.

270
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,089
There's nothing that can stop you anymore.

271
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,049
The world is ours.

272
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,650
Now go and make them all suffer.

273
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,250
I got a pig?

274
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:52,740
That was interesting.

275
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:05,049
That was very weird.

276
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:11,059
That was very interesting.

277
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:12,339
I don't know how to feel about it.

278
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,259
It was just so bizarre.

279
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,460
Pretty cool.

280
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,720
Let's see if I can...

281
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm still capturing the game.

282
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,799
Which I don't think I am.

283
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,839
Which I don't think I am.

284
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:39,619
Is it still open?

285
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:40,420
Uh oh.

286
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,359
I think it crashed.

287
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,019
No, we're still here.

288
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,859
It was kind of weird.

289
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:49,500
There we go.

290
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay.

291
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,059
Another page of the book.

292
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,180
Strangle Man.

293
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,829
Just a silly book.

294
00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:04,339
What's another good one?

295
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:09,960
Should we do the karaoke one?

296
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:18,730
Karaoke one's good.

297
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:32,890
All right, I need another present.

298
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,779
Error.

299
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:37,220
Please assemble band before musical performance.

300
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,309
I'm gonna play Roblox.

301
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,220
I'll play Roblox on your birthday.

302
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,490
Okay.

303
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,130
Next year.

304
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,970
Oh, here's a page.

305
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:02,220
Give me a present.

306
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,130
The 10th has been circled.

307
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,160
10th of October.

308
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,680
Uh, I'm not reading all that.

309
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:30,869
Present is the next present.

310
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:41,829
I missed it.

311
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:49,349
Turn the light on and off.

312
00:27:49,349 --> 00:28:20,779
What happened?

313
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:21,500
Thank you.

314
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:28,150
All right, I'll do the karaoke one.

315
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,700
I hope it captures.

316
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:47,109
I think I have to do the window again.

317
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:49,819
This video game contains flashes of light.

318
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:51,019
Viewer discretion is advised.

319
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:51,579
Okay.

320
00:28:51,579 --> 00:29:01,130
Capture the window.

321
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,819
That's so weird how that happens.

322
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,019
I think it's because it's a compilation

323
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:16,410
and it's loading a different game.

324
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,130
There.

325
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,190
Okay, so that should do it.

326
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:30,200
Why is this on the screen?

327
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,430
Um, what's going on?

328
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,509
I think it crashed.

329
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:41,990
Shit.

330
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:53,990
What?

331
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,779
Uh, yeah, it's crashed.

332
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:56,259
Shit.

333
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,299
Come on, really?

334
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:07,660
Can I reload it?

335
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,289
Let me try reloading it.

336
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:26,859
I'll try one more time.

337
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:38,950
Okay, new game.

338
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,400
I'm just gonna do new game.

339
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,160
You don't see it, but that's all right.

340
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,950
I'm just trying to get into the game first.

341
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,069
Like right here.

342
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:55,859
Oh, this is fucked up.

343
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:02,599
This is very bizarre.

344
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,750
Okay.

345
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,269
Can you see it now?

346
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:16,420
I think you can see it now.

347
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,980
Hey, it's loud as all hell.

348
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,019
Turn that down.

349
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,819
Let's try it.

350
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:27,430
It looks busy.

351
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,500
Broken.

352
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:52,220
I guess it's a karaoke machine.

353
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,559
I have no interest in talking to this guy.

354
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,920
One shot, please.

355
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,859
Okay.

356
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,579
Take it.

357
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,700
Jasper and Lace.

358
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,539
I'm Jasper, the guy by the stage is Lace.

359
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,299
And before you ask, yes, we're identical twins.

360
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:08,099
Where's the toilet?

361
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:08,500
It's broken.

362
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,779
What if I have to go?

363
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,220
This is why we only sell shots.

364
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,980
You drank too much before you came here.

365
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,710
There's a toilet in the back.

366
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,680
Okay, thanks.

367
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,569
It's a headlamp.

368
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:24,890
Okay.

369
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,000
No problem.

370
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,680
Code for the door is 145.

371
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,039
All right, so did I get it?

372
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:35,259
Thank you.

373
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:49,640
Lights seem to be working.

374
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,240
I'll keep the headlamp off for now.

375
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:05,380
This must be Phil.

376
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:26,009
Better not wake him.

377
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:35,960
Okay, I'm in here.

378
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,680
What now?

379
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:57,319
Okay.

380
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,319
That was beautiful.

381
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:19,449
A rail lever?

382
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:21,269
One of seven.

383
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:26,219
Rail lever?

384
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,340
What's happening?

385
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,179
What is that?

386
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:48,900
What is that?

387
00:34:48,900 --> 00:35:22,860
Is this a granny-like?

388
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,820
No, I don't think so.

389
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,940
This is not a granny-like.

390
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:56,219
Okay.

391
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:57,420
How do I move?

392
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:06,010
How do I get out of here?

393
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,099
I was waiting for it.

394
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:39,989
I was like, I thought it was going to come this way.

395
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,860
Nope.

396
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,820
Right into the ground.

397
00:36:41,820 --> 00:37:22,250
There's a bed down here.

398
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:37,929
Yeah.

399
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:38,570
What else?

400
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,610
What else is going on?

401
00:37:39,610 --> 00:38:05,260
What does that mean?

402
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:22,730
You should have just pissed in the street.

403
00:38:22,730 --> 00:39:11,429
Oh, you're shooting at me.

404
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:12,710
You're shooting a gun at me.

405
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,670
You're shooting a gun at me.

406
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,030
You have a gun and you're shooting it.

407
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,420
Where am I?

408
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:23,579
My god.

409
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:24,699
Okay, I'm alive.

410
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:39,579
Hello.

411
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:41,699
Hello.

412
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:44,460
I'm sorry I scared you.

413
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,219
I'm not used to visitors.

414
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,420
You're not supposed to be up there.

415
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,780
That area is shut off.

416
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,159
I'm up here by mistake.

417
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,760
Well, you better get out of there.

418
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,800
There's a lady with a gun.

419
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,599
A lady with a gun?

420
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,079
Yeah.

421
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,500
I don't have time for this.

422
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:56,980
You're all out.

423
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,460
You're all the same.

424
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,179
You tunnel people.

425
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:00,889
You're all out of your goddamn minds.

426
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:01,369
Tell you what.

427
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,489
Go back up and out the air vent.

428
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,210
Enter the code 789 by the gate to the tunnels.

429
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,730
Take the right tunnel, not the left one.

430
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:12,409
Okay.

431
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,650
Take the right one, not the left one.

432
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,909
789.

433
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:17,190
Gate to the tunnels.

434
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:25,849
I get that a lot from you people.

435
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:26,889
Run along now.

436
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,219
All right.

437
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,579
789.

438
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:36,730
It's the gate.

439
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,449
Where is that?

440
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:49,800
Can I get back up here?

441
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,519
How do I get out of here?

442
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:59,619
Is there a different way?

443
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:04,809
I need to crouch.

444
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:08,179
This is a jump at the...

445
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:08,579
I don't know.

446
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,380
Let's try that again.

447
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:18,309
Can I just...

448
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,190
No, I can't.

449
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,469
Oh, I can.

450
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:43,750
Door's locked.

451
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,949
Wait, what did that just open?

452
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:48,889
789.

453
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:49,849
What did that just do?

454
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:56,789
What did it do?

455
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:06,710
The gate right next to you opened.

456
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,269
This...

457
00:42:07,269 --> 00:42:07,590
I didn't...

458
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,469
I wasn't even looking.

459
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:30,090
I didn't know why he didn't want me to go into the left tunnel.

460
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,210
He said, don't go there.

461
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,329
Why would I go into the left tunnel?

462
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:34,329
What do you mean I want to find out why

463
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:38,699
he wanted me not to go down the left tunnel?

464
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:40,219
That's not how this works.

465
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:44,099
I really need to figure out why he didn't want me to go down there.

466
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:51,079
No, you just listen, man.

467
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,199
I have a gun.

468
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,840
I've got a weapon now.

469
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,820
Sorry.

470
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:19,159
Hey.

471
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,320
Five.

472
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:48,219
Five, eight.

473
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:48,860
Five, eight.

474
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,019
Five, eight.

475
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,449
What else can I do?

476
00:44:57,449 --> 00:44:58,409
Is there anything else to see?

477
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,570
I can't see anything.

478
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,369
Five, eight.

479
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:06,869
Five, eight, one.

480
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,860
Five, eight, one.

481
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:13,900
Five, eight, one.

482
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:25,380
I definitely need these.

483
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:38,199
That song is terrifying.

484
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,469
Where?

485
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,030
Jesus.

486
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:42,179
You're going to stand up, aren't you?

487
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,000
No.

488
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,679
Fuck.

489
00:46:48,679 --> 00:47:01,500
How far away am I?

490
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:11,940
It's not that far.

491
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:20,710
Okay, go down the other tunnel.

492
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,139
Okay, right.

493
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:24,699
Wait, what?

494
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:29,320
Yeah, let's go.

495
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,840
Now I get what I'm supposed to be doing.

496
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:36,889
Speed run time.

497
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:37,610
Five, eight, one.

498
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:38,170
And I can just walk.

499
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:39,210
I can run through this.

500
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:46,420
Five, eight, one.

501
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,590
I think I have to do it.

502
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:44,250
Let's go.

503
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:54,570
This is pretty scary.

504
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:54,889
It is.

505
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,730
It's just off-putting.

506
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:04,420
Back where I was.

507
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,420
I have not been hit yet, so that's good.

508
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:20,409
Okay, that's a lot of shots.

509
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:49,829
Okay, don't die here.

510
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:50,389
Jesus.

511
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,429
Hey, where?

512
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:12,309
Where are you?

513
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,980
I don't know where they are.

514
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,539
Where?

515
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:30,039
Okay, there's another code right here.

516
00:50:30,039 --> 00:51:01,960
Where are you?

517
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,679
Ah!

518
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:25,000
Wait, what?

519
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:35,909
This is just back to where I was.

520
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:53,030
Did I miss something?

521
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:36,650
I'm just going back down here.

522
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:37,690
Number four guy.

523
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,449
Now he's just number three, six, seven.

524
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,969
Oh, shit.

525
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:42,090
Okay, let's go.

526
00:52:42,489 --> 00:53:01,110
Three, six, seven.

527
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,989
Wait, that's not the right one.

528
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:06,710
Wait.

529
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:08,360
Where was that door?

530
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,320
It was back here.

531
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:19,269
Where was that shit?

532
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:19,989
There it is.

533
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:29,050
Where is that?

534
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:34,869
Where was that?

535
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:58,579
Where you just were?

536
00:53:58,579 --> 00:53:59,139
Shit, okay.

537
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:53,369
What the fuck?

538
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:59,429
Excuse me, where am I?

539
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,590
You're in Potogzow.

540
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,980
Who are you?

541
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,679
I'm Stig, the tram operator.

542
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,809
Where does the tram go?

543
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:09,929
Down the mountain, into the valley.

544
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:11,050
Can you see all the...

545
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,329
Can you see the lit window?

546
00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:12,889
The red light?

547
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:14,010
It's been blinking all night.

548
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,019
It's irritating.

549
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:16,980
The blinking doesn't...

550
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,739
She have anything better to do.

551
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:21,750
Who is she?

552
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,900
She's a nobody.

553
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,679
If she were to disappear,

554
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:25,719
I don't think anyone would care.

555
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,539
How do I get to her?

556
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:30,019
With the tram.

557
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:31,380
But we only operate the tram at night

558
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,420
during special occasions,

559
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,739
such as the famous Potogzow

560
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,219
Orienteering Gathering.

561
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,820
What if I need to use it?

562
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,250
Wait till morning.

563
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:46,019
Then you'll need the approval of Maria, my manager.

564
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,119
How do I find Maria?

565
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,340
Walk along the train tracks

566
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,059
and into the forest.

567
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,179
You'll find her eventually.

568
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:53,579
Okay.

569
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:54,139
Am I dead?

570
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,739
I'm not a mortician.

571
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:57,699
I'm a tram operator.

572
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:00,489
Okay.

573
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,019
This was a dream.

574
00:56:02,019 --> 00:56:03,380
We'd probably be somewhere else

575
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,659
than in Potogzow.

576
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,860
What choice do I have?

577
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,500
I like it.

578
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,059
Okay.

579
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:09,260
So follow the train tracks.

580
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:16,889
I have full health.

581
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:31,909
To ride, talk to tram operator.

582
00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:42,710
Walk along the train tracks.

583
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:43,909
Where are they?

584
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:46,409
Down here?

585
00:56:46,409 --> 00:57:02,090
I am technically...

586
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,690
Technically correct.

587
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:16,019
That was technically correct.

588
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,460
Run down the tracks.

589
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,480
How am I supposed to do that?

590
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:43,800
Did I just overshoot it?

591
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,119
Huh?

592
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,500
That wasn't the tracks.

593
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,219
That's the tracks.

594
00:57:54,219 --> 00:58:01,530
That was the tracks.

595
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:02,250
Okay.

596
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:06,090
I guess not.

597
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,929
You were just on the tracks.

598
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:10,809
You mean like up here?

599
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,230
I thought this is the train.

600
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,780
Train tracks, not tram tracks.

601
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:27,639
Those aren't train tracks.

602
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:28,679
That's a tram track.

603
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,940
Fucking tram track in front of your eyes.

604
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,019
I thought it was like to go on the train track.

605
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:48,099
I'm the tram operator.

606
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:50,099
Get on the train tram tracks.

607
00:58:50,099 --> 00:59:16,010
Okay.

608
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:40,619
Well, was I supposed to do that?

609
00:59:41,179 --> 01:00:02,789
Oh, they have writing shit.

610
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:03,190
Okay.

611
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,750
What does it say?

612
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,010
Nine, four...

613
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:29,659
Nine, four, six?

614
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,750
There's one more.

615
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,639
Nine something four six three.

616
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,449
Nine, four six three.

617
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,090
Nine, two, four, six, three.

618
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,900
Two, four, six, three.

619
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:12,630
Okay.

620
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:36,059
What is the camera covering?

621
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,179
Just the amount of bullets I have.

622
01:01:37,179 --> 01:01:38,219
It's 57.

623
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:47,340
Jesus.

624
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,219
Oops.

625
01:02:14,219 --> 01:02:14,539
Okay.

626
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:15,820
I think it automatically did it.

627
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,300
Oh.

628
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:08,039
Oh.

629
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,980
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what.

630
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,119
Oh my fucking God.

631
01:03:14,119 --> 01:03:15,000
There's so many of them.

632
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,500
I...

633
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,539
It's so disorienting.

634
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:29,460
Okay.

635
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,010
Am I right?

636
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:41,369
I woke up early this morning trying to get the blood out of my hair.

637
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:46,380
Can I get on there?

638
01:03:46,380 --> 01:04:09,739
This is long.

639
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:11,670
I didn't think it was gonna be this long.

640
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:13,750
We're probably near the end.

641
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:21,739
Okay.

642
01:04:21,739 --> 01:04:34,219
Am I hitting golf balls or something?

643
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:41,349
How do I talk to this person?

644
01:04:41,349 --> 01:05:03,099
I don't think I can get up here.

645
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:03,579
The ladder?

646
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:09,750
I can't climb the ladder.

647
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:21,590
Like, I can't get up here.

648
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,139
Maria?

649
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:24,659
I need to ride the tram.

650
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:27,050
Why are you telling me?

651
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,409
Did Stieg send you here?

652
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:28,650
Yes.

653
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:29,849
He said you're the manager.

654
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:32,280
Oh, that's funny.

655
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,179
I'm not his manager.

656
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:33,900
We don't work together.

657
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,780
Stieg is my orienteering buddy.

658
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,579
Bring me back some of my golf balls from the forest and I'll let you.

659
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:45,239
Find your own way back to the tram then.

660
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:45,480
All right.

661
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,000
I'll get you golf balls.

662
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,460
That's your handicap.

663
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,860
Four, five, 45.

664
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,500
What are you shooting at?

665
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,800
Okay.

666
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,039
So I gotta go get your golf balls.

667
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:35,880
I think I should have found one by now.

668
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:44,570
What is this?

669
01:06:44,570 --> 01:07:10,489
Okay.

670
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:12,329
Five, five, five, eight.

671
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,590
I probably shouldn't have done that.

672
01:07:19,989 --> 01:07:21,690
I didn't talk.

673
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:23,539
What?

674
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,619
The train tunnel entrance has a new code.

675
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:26,980
Five, five, five, eight.

676
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:33,699
I don't know what I just did.

677
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:47,880
They're pointing at this.

678
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,679
Can I close it?

679
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,829
Five, five, five, eight.

680
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,380
Train tunnel entrance has a new code.

681
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:29,770
I woke up early this morning.

682
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,500
What's the twist here?

683
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:42,739
Right?

684
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:44,100
There's gotta be some twist.

685
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:49,289
There's no way it's just this.

686
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,210
What happened to being at a karaoke bar?

687
01:08:51,210 --> 01:09:14,579
I forgot that even happened.

688
01:09:14,579 --> 01:09:38,439
Here it comes.

689
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:39,159
What the fuck?

690
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:40,920
Who's shooting?

691
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:41,159
Where?

692
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:41,560
From where?

693
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:12,170
Should have hit.

694
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,159
Shut up.

695
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:27,880
Where are you shooting?

696
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,079
Oh my goodness.

697
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:50,310
Come on.

698
01:11:58,359 --> 01:11:59,560
I can't even see.

699
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:17,829
Okay.

700
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:19,750
Don't walk off the edge.

701
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:27,779
What does that do for us?

702
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:33,180
Shoot like a grandma.

703
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:33,500
Sorry.

704
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,260
This is not a granny like.

705
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:47,979
What am I supposed to do?

706
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:52,579
I was...

707
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:36,539
Bonzi buddy.

708
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:51,770
Okay.

709
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,529
So now I can use the train.

710
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,939
Sorry.

711
01:13:54,939 --> 01:13:55,739
Tram.

712
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,800
How do I use the tram?

713
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:03,100
Hello?

714
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:07,369
Did I turn it on?

715
01:14:07,369 --> 01:14:10,659
Okay.

716
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:11,380
I have this guy.

717
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,819
R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.

718
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:44,789
So what are we doing?

719
01:14:58,659 --> 01:16:27,369
Like.

720
01:16:27,369 --> 01:16:29,850
I woke up early.

721
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:30,329
Here it comes.

722
01:16:30,329 --> 01:16:30,729
All right.

723
01:16:41,909 --> 01:16:48,420
I don't need bullets.

724
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:54,520
There's no bullets in this gun.

725
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:24,869
This is Lace.

726
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:26,149
The other one's Jasper.

727
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:27,430
They jumped me in the forest.

728
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:28,550
Put me in an old freezer.

729
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,069
Kept me in a fucking cage.

730
01:17:30,069 --> 01:17:32,069
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.

731
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,579
Thanks for getting me out.

732
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:34,859
Sorry for all the blood.

733
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:37,960
You're welcome.

734
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,640
I need to get back home.

735
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:40,760
Do you live in Texas?

736
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:41,399
We're in Texas?

737
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:43,479
No, I'm from Ptokso.

738
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:44,680
You probably haven't heard of it.

739
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,199
It's a small little village in the forest.

740
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,619
Maybe you've heard of the Ptokso

741
01:17:48,619 --> 01:17:50,220
Orienteering Gathering.

742
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,060
You have a car?

743
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,739
Can you give me a ride?

744
01:17:53,739 --> 01:18:13,300
That was weird.

745
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,260
Oh, here we go.

746
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,539
I woke up early this morning.

747
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:21,720
Trying to get the blood out of my hair.

748
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,460
Franking up the sound on my hi-fi.

749
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:29,979
Out the screen downstairs.

750
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:35,319
Smiling along to my memories.

751
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,140
Of what we've been lup to.

752
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:44,039
To my brother and I were laughing.

753
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,239
What else?

754
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,560
We know the lyrics.

755
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:01,960
What the fuck?

756
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:15,000
I don't want to sing this part.

757
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:30,569
I'm not singing this part.

758
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,020
That was good.

759
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:13,100
My mic just freaked out.

760
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:27,899
Is there anything else?

761
01:20:28,859 --> 01:20:35,609
So they were singing karaoke about a crime they committed.

762
01:20:36,979 --> 01:20:38,420
And then I went to rescue the girl.

763
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,539
That's crazy.

764
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:41,319
That was a good one.

765
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:48,869
That was good.

766
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:49,590
All right.

767
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,500
I think I'm going to call it here.

768
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:56,699
That was a fun night of games.

769
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:00,489
It's great to see Vinny and you guys, right?

770
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,600
The next time you see me will be on Halloween night.

771
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,979
Or Halloween day.

772
01:21:10,359 --> 01:21:11,319
Actually, what time will it be?

773
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,270
I think it's going to be 12 p.m. Eastern.

774
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:18,229
I will be on Charlie's Cooking Show.

775
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:21,060
Company time.

776
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,020
Should be fun.

777
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,210
So I will not be live on this channel,

778
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:29,300
but go to Charlie's channel on Halloween.

779
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,890
Should be fun.

780
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:31,689
I'm looking forward to it.

781
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,380
And for horror games, I'm not big on granny likes.

782
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,260
I'm not very good at them.

783
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:42,600
I have very jumpy and I have pay attention problems.

784
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:47,460
The granny likes destroy me.

785
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,659
But it's still fun.

786
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,550
I still had a lot of fun.

787
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:51,430
It was a great night of games.

788
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:55,130
I will see you guys on Halloween.

789
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:59,239
Please go watch the critical.

790
01:21:59,239 --> 01:22:03,159
Yeah, Charlie, critical.

791
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:04,199
Is Charlie live right now?

792
01:22:05,239 --> 01:22:06,439
Which is Ray Charlie?

793
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:08,039
Is he live?

794
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:14,760
He's doing some YouTube stuff.

795
01:22:16,199 --> 01:22:16,840
Go say hello.

796
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:18,739
So it should be a fun time.

797
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,020
Halloween day.

798
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,659
See you guys soon.

799
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:21,380
Thanks for watching.

800
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,979
Have a great night.

801
01:22:24,979 --> 01:22:31,560
See you on the 31st.

802
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,960
And go say hello to Charlie.

803
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,170
I'm going to go take a bath.

804
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,130
I'm sweating.

805
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:40,979
I'll be really honest with you.

806
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
I think after about hour number four or five

807
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:49,020
after screaming like a thousand times,

808
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,859
I kind of ran out of gas.

809
01:22:50,859 --> 01:22:53,739
I got scared so many times tonight

810
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:55,500
that I think I ran out of gas

811
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,859
after like hour number five and a half.

812
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:05,560
Okay.

813
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,479
When your body screams like that, like

814
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,640
it just drains you so physically.

815
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,560
It's so we could tell.

816
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:17,319
I wanted to stick it through

817
01:23:17,319 --> 01:23:18,119
for a couple of these though

818
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,319
because they are really fun.

819
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:22,760
All right.

820
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,760
Let's say hi to Charlie.

821
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:26,310
Good night, guys.

822
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,510
See you on the 31st.

823
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:30,619
Have a wonderful rest of your evening.

824
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:32,060
Whatever is left of it or good morning.

825
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:32,779
If you're just waking up,

826
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:35,670
it's pretty late for a lot of you.

827
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:37,850
See you soon.

828
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,810
Also check out grottobeasts.net

829
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,890

831
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,439
which is the collectible card

832
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:49,720
trading card game.

833
01:23:54,649 --> 01:23:54,890
Okay.

834
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,329
Let me get it ready.

835
01:23:56,329 --> 01:24:05,699
All right.

836
01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:11,189
Go say hello to Charlie.

837
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:13,909
12 noon I believe on the 31st.

838
01:24:13,909 --> 01:24:15,670
He'll probably be able to update that.

839
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:16,390
Follow his Twitter.

840
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:17,829
Make sure you're aware of it.

841
01:24:17,829 --> 01:24:20,010
That will be where the most

842
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,449
up-to-date information will be.

843
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:23,539
Good night, guys.

844
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:24,180
See you soon.
