1
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:18,089
Okay, get Elden Ring opened. I'm very excited about this. I do have to change a few things.

2
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:29,320
The reason why I'm so excited about Elden Ring is we are, I believe, at one of the probably

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:40,250
final points in the game. I am halfway, I believe, down the Hallow Tree. It looks like there was a

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:48,119
lot more to go. I do have to change this title though because this doesn't work. Uh, how about...

5
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,740
What's a good... I've done Elden Ring so many times. I don't even know what a good Elden Ring

6
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:11,819
title is anymore. What do I title this? Elden Ring... Elden... All right, spoiler alert. End game

7
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:37,879
area. Spoiler alert. Alert. Nothing easy, whatever. Elden... Elden. Elden Time. Onion Ring. That's awful.

8
00:01:41,459 --> 00:02:05,019
Elden Ring. Getting to the end? Question mark? We'll see. Stay tuned to find out. Is it a bad title?

9
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:13,960
Whatever, it doesn't matter. What is playing in my headphones? Oh, this music, right. I was like,

10
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:39,740
where's that coming from? Okay, very nice. Is the game gonna get seen here? That's a Tuber title,

11
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:49,340
if I've ever seen one. Yeah, it is. I agree. I'm not gonna disagree with you. Sometimes Tuber titles

12
00:02:49,340 --> 00:03:05,219
work. The face... The face game is not going off. It's on. Face game, is it gonna go? Hey, loading it.

13
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,330
What was the last... Okay, the last thing that... Somebody gave me a list of things I could do.

14
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,370
By the way, this is very much spoiler territory. This is actually like the end of the game

15
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:32,069
or like the final arc. Just please be aware of that. Be aware. Looking for a game to capture.

16
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:46,360
Right here, dude. This needs to shrink. Okay, so we... Last thing that happened.

17
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,349
Let me take a look at the map. Yeah, so I... Spoilers for anybody that like seriously does it.

18
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:01,780
It's like, what's happening? This is a spoiler. This is an end game spoiler. Three, two, one.

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,319
I burnt the urn tree. The urn tree is burning. The round table hold is now burning.

20
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:18,439
The two fingers are still stuck with their game crashed. I don't know why they're not back.

21
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:31,860
You'd think that they'd be like... They'd come back. So there was the halog tree. It was up here.

22
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,899
Oh, that's right. I did that thing too. Okay, so there was the halog tree. I could keep going down

23
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:45,939
or I could do this crumbling thing. And I think that somebody said there was an actual,

24
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,259
probably a better way to do it. Should I start at the halog tree or should I start at the crumbling

25
00:04:50,259 --> 00:05:00,649
place? Okay, so I'm trying to remember what the... Because I killed... There was a boss here. Let's go

26
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:09,370
find it. How did I miss this much? I've been streaming this a lot. This is like my favorite

27
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,350
game ever. Okay, so let's just get back into this here. I got my moon stuff. Very nice.

28
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:28,339
I think this is the wrong one. I think it's this one. It's this one, right? The last thing that I

29
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:41,100
did is I beat Loretta. Yes, right here. Okay, so then I could keep going that way. Now I have not

30
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,459
been spoiled on anything in the game. I've been trying to stay away from a lot of Elden Ring stuff,

31
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:57,350
but I know for a fact that the boss that everyone hates I think is down here. So I can't tell you

32
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:01,509
that I'm necessarily prepared. I'm going to turn around and go do something else if I can't do it.

33
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:12,389
I think I can level up. Maybe I can. So this stream is going to continue. It's still pretty

34
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:23,990
early. I imagine I'll be able to play... What time is it? Like three or four hours? See? I need some

35
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:34,389
souls. All right, well, let's just go. Whatever. Two headphones going in. It's just not going to do.

36
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:48,230
All right, halog tree time. Let's go. How's the volume? Is it good? It's going to play for six

37
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:59,259
hours. What's it going to go until I don't feel like it? Interesting. All right, so that's the

38
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,620
halog tree. So what the fuck is the halog tree? Is somebody going to tell me when I go down here?

39
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:17,259
I don't think I can jump to there. Jerma, are you EST or PST? I am PST.

40
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:35,660
I think we need a fucking style light. Yes, we do. G4! G4 RAID! G4 TV! What's going on?

41
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:44,920
So I probably scared the shit out of people. I'm sorry. I may have just scared the absolute shit

42
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,519
out of all of you and I'm really sorry. G4 just raided. G4 raided before too. Thanks, G4.

43
00:07:52,410 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank you. That's cool. I'm sorry. I scared the shit out of you. I'm really sorry.

44
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:08,069
No, thanks for the raid. You just missed me. Excuse me. Round as the bro versus bro against

45
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:24,660
Ludwig Championship. I just won. Spoiler. Ooh, okay. Ancient Dragons. We're at the end of Elden Ring.

46
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,980
So those of you that came from G4, just be aware this is like the last, probably third of the game.

47
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,779
If you don't want to be spoiled or anything, just I would run away now, immediately. Because you're

48
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,740
going to see some shit that you might not want to see if you haven't gotten this far. And I know a

49
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,899
lot of people haven't gotten this far because the game is like 500 hours long. So I get it.

50
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:58,340
Should I go down? Yeah, and if those are the new viewers, we always have to have fucking

51
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,990
skylight on. Helps you see a lot. That's a good tip. Yeah, they had this misspelling here.

52
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:12,309
I don't know why it's spelled that way. It's S-T-A-H. I think that's somebody fucked up.

53
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:27,720
Elviel, Brace of the Hallow Tree. Both of my weapons are max level. So unless I change what

54
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:47,059
I'm doing here, I don't have any need to go back and upgrade because of those knights.

55
00:09:47,620 --> 00:10:01,100
All right, Starlight's kind of getting in the way. Starlight actually is bad.

56
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,309
I gotta get back in the swing thing. I gotta get back in the swing. It's been a while. It's been

57
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:25,059
like four or five days. I gotta remember what the buttons do. We're good. We're good. We're good.

58
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:38,059
I got it. See? Oh shit. Please make your face cam bounce around with the window screen saver.

59
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:49,029
Why would I do that? I still don't have enough. Is there anything else out there?

60
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,620
Whoa! My god, you are alive again. Oh well. I need to do this so I don't get mad and lose my souls.

61
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:14,230
That was dumb. All right, I gotta get back in the swing thing. It's like warm up. You don't

62
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,029
just like go out and throw nine enemies. I gotta go to the bullpen and like warm up for like 10

63
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:26,149
minutes. You can't just go out and pitch nine enemies. You gotta warm up. You gotta go through

64
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:38,730
the fucking rotation. Why do we come in with a raid? A YouTube raid? What's up, guys? Bro versus

65
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:54,789
bro champion. Okay. Where are the souls? Okay. All right. Hey, I gotta pay attention. Don't get the

66
00:11:54,789 --> 00:12:03,480
souls. Don't lose 100,000 souls like an idiot. All right. Warm up is happening. Walk onto them.

67
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:15,860
Do I have enough to level up so I can stop doing this? No. God damn it. Okay. Just kill

68
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,850
one thing out. It's got to be like a randomly person or something out here. There we go. Okay.

69
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:45,830
That's better. Level up. What should I put it into? Yeah. Welcome, guys. Thanks, Ludwig. Always a

70
00:12:45,830 --> 00:13:02,200
pleasure and some time with Ludwig. Probably mine. I want my mana. All right. Let's go.

71
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:27,929
I think I exploded. Hey, blow up. This way. I gotta get my gaming juices. I feel like I

72
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:37,740
I feel like I used up a lot of my gaming like juices. Is that bird tree avatar here?

73
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:53,750
You're gonna need a lot of juice. That guy didn't even have an Estus. I don't even know why. He had

74
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:09,690
an empty flask. I think I'm just gonna go straight for now. I could drop down there, but I could do

75
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:22,860
that anyways. Let's see. Let's see what's going on here. Drink, bro. I'm all right. Let's go up.

76
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,139
You're an enemy? These guys drop a lot of souls. Holy shit.

77
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:45,179
By the way, if you don't know, I am a cold wizard. Utilize ice spells, cold spells.

78
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:14,039
Is it Flintstone Sorcerer? Well, not really. Wait, can I go up there? I can. I guess I could

79
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,879
have dropped anyways, though. Fuck it. Let's go. Let's do it.

80
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:36,580
Michelin knight sword? All right. What is that? Strength, dex, and faith. Sword forged by servants

81
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,860
of Mickela of the Hallow Tree. With a design modeled after those carried by carrion knights.

82
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,700
Instead of the glintstone, however, amber from the Hallow Tree is embedded in the blade.

83
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:52,419
A sumptuous piece, yet it has never been offered to any knight an ill-starred sword with no master.

84
00:15:53,379 --> 00:16:02,309
Holy essence and fires off a golden blade projectile? That seems kind of cool.

85
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:17,100
Strength? Is it a great sword? Strength and dex. It's a cool faith sword. Do I want to go there yet?

86
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,370
Is the item down? All right. I'm gonna go to... Should I go down or keep going that way?

87
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:35,220
I could go down there or I could go over here. I want to see what that is. Is it gonna kill me?

88
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:50,740
Is a storm sword key thing over here? Is it not? No, that's where I came from.

89
00:16:50,740 --> 00:17:02,580
I want... Oh no, I want to go down there, down there. All right. There is an avatar here though.

90
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:12,819
What have I done? Okay, I'm good. This is where the stone sword key is.

91
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:30,119
Watch out for the crazy enemies. I got a feeling these enemies are all gonna be crazy. What is this?

92
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:45,400
Triple rings of light? Fires three rings of light before the caster. This is int and faith.

93
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,849
Seen a lot of combo spells. Produces three rings of light and fires in four. The rings of light

94
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,569
return to a position close to the caster before disappearing. Gift from the young

95
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:17,500
Mickela to his father Radagon. Okay. Can't really use it, but yeah, I'm still using the baby rattle.

96
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:23,400
I like it. I don't know how much longer I'm gonna like it, but I know I like it right now

97
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,420
and that's all that matters. Good problem if that didn't find another fucking scream.

98
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:43,829
I really don't want to fight an avatar right now, but I guess I'm gonna have to.

99
00:18:50,630 --> 00:19:12,599
He doesn't know. I actually don't, you're right. I would treat the reeds. What's in here? What do

100
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:26,150
I have in there? Is it the damage boost one? It is. Okay, I think I have enough flasks. Let's

101
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:36,619
top myself off. Let me try it. This is where I was before. Nice armor, dude. This is where I was

102
00:19:36,619 --> 00:20:05,720
before, right? I don't need to climb up here. Let me just check. Let me make sure. Okay, we're good.

103
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:38,180
Go, go, go, go, go. So there's people shooting that stuff over there. I just stepped on his head.

104
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,940
Is there a faster way to get over there? Because this is kind of a terrible awful run.

105
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:55,289
I'm gonna assume no. So let's just. All right, so there's somebody doing that. Casting that spell

106
00:20:55,289 --> 00:21:03,700
over right over there. Oh, is it just him? Is it just him doing it? It is just you doing it.

107
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:30,140
Why are you just spamming that? Come on, you don't have to. Oh, you do not like that cold shit.

108
00:21:30,940 --> 00:22:04,059
Okay, do not get killed by this. We can grate some cheese here. We so desire. I almost died.

109
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:24,230
What's that? What do you got? Rotten staff. B and E causes scarlet rot buildup. Ceremonial staff

110
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,380
depicted the urd tree in its historic radiance. Festers with scarlet rot. Filled by the avatars

111
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:45,450
who protect the minor urd trees. It's rotten. Is there a race in here? No, there's a

112
00:22:45,450 --> 00:23:08,420
room. But I should be fine because I have a flail. It's rotten. Newman's room. It's an item all the

113
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:35,059
way at the end. Sombra ancient dragon stone. Or. I have got a lot of those now. You guys weren't

114
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:48,630
kidding. Those pop up all the time. All right, what about even lower? I definitely can. Not yet.

115
00:23:49,269 --> 00:24:02,950
Let me continue this way. I could jump off from here. That's really dangerous though.

116
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:21,779
All right, I need a shield. Parry shield please. I'm not putting up with this fucking asshole right

117
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:27,880
now. Parry, parry. I don't want heavy load but I just want a little buckler. There's a little

118
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:38,549
buckler. Don't I have one? Is this seriously going to put me over? Heavy load? It doesn't matter.

119
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:48,490
I'm going to parry it like twice. Is that a spear or is that the staff one? Oh, that's the staff one.

120
00:24:48,650 --> 00:25:28,359
Never mind. Oh my god. I thought there was a railing. I thought there was like a waist high

121
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:45,299
railing or something. I did that. Don't, don't, don't, don't. No, I'm fine. Oh my god. I'm okay.

122
00:25:48,059 --> 00:26:27,640
Oh, hold on here. You both suck. I don't want to drop down here again. It was terrible.

123
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:48,569
This way. Through there. Don't screw this up. You seem like the kind of guy that balls with

124
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:57,859
bumpers on. Yeah, I honestly think that the gutter in bowling, I don't know, it doesn't need to

125
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:22,220
exist. I don't understand why it exists. It's way more fun when it doesn't. You seem like you take

126
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,819
mini golf too seriously. Well, that's inaccurate because that means I would, you're assuming I

127
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:31,420
would play mini golf. I fucking hate that shit. I hate mini golf. Mini golf is the most infuriating,

128
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:44,339
unfun, terrible experience. It's never fun. Mini golf seems like a good idea for the first

129
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,299
20 minutes. Then you realize you have to sit there for three hours and do the whole thing.

130
00:27:48,019 --> 00:28:02,380
Nothing here. Weird placement of that enemy. Once you get past the windmill, I'm done. I don't feel

131
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:21,609
like playing anymore. It should just stop at the windmill. There's two of them in here. All right.

132
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:48,519
I got to take this slow on this. Do it. Do it. Do it. You what? Oh, my heart hurts. Oh my god.

133
00:28:49,160 --> 00:29:00,180
My body hurts. This is a fucking terrible place to fight you.

134
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,539
Get out here. We're both trying to do the same dumb shit to each other. Just get out here.

135
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:49,529
Good, good, good. Worst fight ever. Oh, a lot of smithing stones. Sevens. Sorry. Fight me.

136
00:29:49,529 --> 00:30:05,000
This is back up, which I don't, there might be an item that I missed, but we'll see.

137
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:15,700
We'll continue this way. I'm going to say we're going to continue that way.

138
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:37,180
This way. He has such an ape face. An ape-like face. Do I? Kind of. I hear one of those cookie bugs.

139
00:30:39,180 --> 00:31:06,619
Yeah, where's the cookie bug? Don't hit the guy in front of him. Nice. Don't waste man on this guy.

140
00:31:06,619 --> 00:32:01,029
There's no reason to. Race. Oh, I can do that. Old Fang. Whoa. Looks like a building down there.

141
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:09,339
Have you even done the nebula move once? No, because the cold move,

142
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,000
there's not enough people to do it to. And the nebula is a great move and I use it.

143
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,049
Trust me, I do. Did I miss anything down here though? Let me just check.

144
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,829
I feel like there's like a grace or something here. What are you doing?

145
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:55,609
That guy aggro'd to me from downstairs. Really? I think it's safe to drop down there, but not

146
00:32:55,609 --> 00:33:16,809
going to. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Hey. Well, I don't think we're going that way. Okay. Seriously,

147
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:28,329
what's the range on this? I have to go from above. What's that? You missed the grace.

148
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:41,240
Did I vote over here? I'll do the nebula in here. It seems like there's like five feet.

149
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,250
This is why you don't use the nebula. This is why I didn't want to do it

150
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,930
because you're on a goddamn. Oh no. It's one of those guys. Okay. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

151
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:14,869
go, go, go, go. Oh my God. Who's behind me? Oh, ladder. Quick. Oh please. I don't care if

152
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:20,389
I get poisoned. Just go, just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. No poison. Drink, drink on the ladder.

153
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:31,130
These guys are the worst enemy in the game. Those things are so, I freaked out.

154
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:46,550
I actually think that's probably where, that's the way to go. Did I get there before?

155
00:34:46,550 --> 00:35:03,690
I actually kind of don't remember. And then down here and then I don't know. I don't remember.

156
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:12,539
Down all the way. Can I make it from here? I think so. All right. What about this? What's this?

157
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:45,099
Christ. Seed. Ooh. Does that guy have a spear? No, it's a staff. No, it's not. Is that a spear?

158
00:35:46,059 --> 00:36:14,539
Okay. It's a spear. I need a, I need a shield. Oh, good. Holy shit. I'm gonna fucking help you.

159
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:36,920
Oh my God. I lost my subway order. Meatball. Just Meatball Marinara every time. The only thing

160
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,639
that I ever get there. Everything else is fucking dog shit at that, at that place. Meatball Marinara

161
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,039
is the only good thing there. It's super basic. It's super simple. It's not like crazy. Nothing,

162
00:36:46,039 --> 00:37:00,070
nothing weird. Now that I lost my souls, who cares, right? I can go wherever I want.

163
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:34,380
Staff though. Why is somebody, I hear somebody walking behind me. Where is this person? This is

164
00:37:34,380 --> 00:38:11,579
freaking me out. The two moons. Get over here. There above. All right. Chest. Legendary. Clean

165
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:28,500
Rot Knight Finley. Clean Rot Knight? Legendary Ashen remains used to summon the spirit of Clean

166
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,139
Rot Knight Finley. Finley was one of the few survivors of the Battle of Aeonia.

167
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,780
When an unimaginable act of heroism carried the slumbering demigod,

168
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:44,460
Millenia, all the way back to the Hallow Tree. He managed the feat alone,

169
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:58,519
fending off all manner of foes along the way. It's not going to replace Mambo. That's for sure.

170
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:04,260
Really cool though. Sounds really powerful. Sorry, we already have a best friend.

171
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:19,269
I need to get Mambo to plus 10. I don't know what to get a great grave glove ward. Should I go?

172
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:34,340
I don't think the play is down there. It's over here. Yeah, Mambo. I already did that.

173
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,409
This is the, okay, this part here. So you drop down. I'm just going to run to the

174
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:45,510
fucking bonfire or whatever it is. Right, right, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

175
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:50,019
All right. Right there. Right there. Right there. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Quick, quick, quick, quick.

176
00:39:51,670 --> 00:40:07,829
Before he spawns, he's going to spawn. Go. Arrows? I think I'm safe. This should take me behind the,

177
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:23,829
yep, fucking avatar here. Oh, I'm running in the door. There's nothing here.

178
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:31,639
Oh, this is very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Very bad. Why have that there?

179
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:44,380
What's the point of this? It's just a thing. Why have that there?

180
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:49,980
Pulled for that reason. For that exact reason. For that, no, you fell for it. Yeah.

181
00:40:50,780 --> 00:41:17,940
I'm right. Okay. That's the strategy. I know there's a grave somewhere. There has to be

182
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:28,090
somewhere right here. Right? All right. Same deal. Except I'm running right behind that avatar.

183
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:39,719
I'll come back out here and deal with this. Right there. Right past the avatar. Fucking,

184
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,519
why am I looking at you? Why am I looking over here? I know. I know. Stop looking over there.

185
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,440
Why am I looking? I know where it is. Just jump off. It's going to kill me. Three, two, one.

186
00:41:48,440 --> 00:42:06,039
Fuck this game. Mad. Omega low. Oh, why did you jump? I, because I didn't mean to. My, it was a

187
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:18,579
reaction. I got to get there and then I'm going to go behind the urdry and attack from,

188
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:39,829
I'm going to go and backstab. Don't be stupid. Right here. Up down here. Don't stop moving.

189
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:56,139
There it is. Beautiful. Here. Excellent ball. That's fine. Go. Brink on the ladder. Don't stop.

190
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:14,539
Thank you. That went right between my legs. All right. Right there. Here we go. One, two, three.

191
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:56,420
Fuck just happened. You shoot. I touched it. I win. I touched it. I win. Ladder goes up, but

192
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:15,289
let's go. Let's do it. Check this out. Tree cannot come in here. Tree is in the building. Tree

193
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:33,400
can come in here. That's good to know. I thought you were going to get stuck. All right. You can't

194
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:49,900
come through here. No, I don't want to drink that potion. Where'd he go? What just happened?

195
00:44:49,900 --> 00:45:26,420
Where'd he go? What do you got? Lord's Ruin and another rotten staff. Cross build is OP. Cross

196
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,340
build is very powered. I'm not just going to run through this thing because I want to see what

197
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:50,409
happens. There was an item or two that was over here. Works until it doesn't. I win. 11,000 souls.

198
00:45:50,570 --> 00:46:02,780
Holy shit. Bud. Put your waste man on these chumps.

199
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:20,219
There's another one that's... Yeah, you. Does this reach? Really? Okay. Well, I think I can get these.

200
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:45,670
Let's see what's down here first. Can we get a birdwatch in the corner? Nah.

201
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:57,989
You can get like a sweaty guy corner. You can get a sweaty guy in a dark room. That's all I got for

202
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:22,199
you. Let's use the sowlord's room. 12,000 is what we need. 11,8. What about frogwatch?

203
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:44,139
Frogs are cool. Can we watch Jimmy Neutron? No, you cannot watch Jimmy Neutron. No frog stream. No,

204
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:50,679
stop. No frog. Stop it. That changed. Maybe I should turn the exposure up. What do you like

205
00:47:50,679 --> 00:48:09,989
that I'm sitting in kind of a dark, sweaty room? It's reminding myself. That is... Am I urinal on?

206
00:48:09,989 --> 00:48:16,739
No frog stream. No. Can we do an armpit check? No, no, you're like...

207
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:35,849
Hallow Tree Knight Helm. Elm worn by knights sworn to the Hallow Tree,

208
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:45,349
graced by a crown of unalloyed gold, increases faith by two. I think I look good.

209
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,219
This is pretty much what I'm going to be wearing. All right, so what's out here?

210
00:48:54,179 --> 00:49:19,159
Elusiary wall? Elusiary wall this way? I mean, I could drop. No, that's where it just was. Nah,

211
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:42,199
okay. Good. Jerry wall? Elusiary. Elusory. How do you say it? Elus... Elusory? Here. Elusory?

212
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:54,150
What the fuck? Let's kill him. Right now. Watch this. I gotta kill that one first because that's

213
00:49:54,150 --> 00:50:32,280
the one that casts spells. So we're going to go Dark Moon. I got it. Whatever. I got it. There's

214
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,519
nothing else over here that I need to do. What was that? A crystal, a rotten crystal sword? What

215
00:50:36,519 --> 00:51:02,730
was it? You fucking suck balls. Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Okay, where is it? Rotten crystal.

216
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:09,289
This is int. Oh, it's strength. Scarlet Rot. Sword fashion from pure crystal,

217
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:15,099
a deed impossible for a human, and wreath with powerful magic, its attack scales with intelligence.

218
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:28,380
You can two-hand that? Yeah, but do I want to? I have no strength, though. I would have to respect

219
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,400
the character. We don't need to talk about respects until I really cannot beat certain things.

220
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:46,280
What does it look like? I mean, that's really cool. It's really cool, but it is kind of just

221
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:57,780
a weapon. It doesn't have anything like really fancy. Maybe rattle is slower,

222
00:51:59,059 --> 00:52:09,159
but whatever. That's cool. Keep the rattle. Oh, Scarlet Rot. That's right. Huh. Let's look into

223
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:42,280
that in a minute. Not going over there yet. Hero's rune. What about the moon veil? I have a ton of

224
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:59,539
stones that I have not used in like 40 game hours. I can... goodness. Damn, that goes pretty

225
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:08,260
deep. If I want to upgrade another weapon, I can. So I'm very, very, very capable of just going and

226
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:21,829
just maxing out three other weapons if I really want to. What the fuck is that? It's one of those

227
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:29,829
things. What are you doing? That was... I didn't like that. That was unsettling. I didn't like it.

228
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:59,750
Is that rot? Of course it is. Holy fucking god, he came around. Holy shit, don't die, please.

229
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:17,820
Just gotta go in. Pest's glaive. Did I get one of these already? I feel like I've seen that.

230
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:42,230
Have I? No, where is it? Yeah, okay. I've seen it. Didn't impress me. Is there... Can I get... I

231
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:53,619
can't get on the horse either. This sucks. This really sucks. Oh my god, I cannot... All right,

232
00:54:53,619 --> 00:55:10,500
that's bad. You gotta be shitting me. Okay, I need something. Please put a dagger on. A quick

233
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:22,699
step, right? Do not roll. Oh, that's right. Okay, I just need to dash. Did I roll to get it off me?

234
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:40,710
All right, I need some points of interest. I'm gonna get to that. Something's alive down there.

235
00:55:42,980 --> 00:56:10,099
Soap time. Wow, it worked. All right, here we go. Oh my god, please. Please get the fuck away from

236
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:20,199
me. Please. Just keep going. Keep going. Keep going. I can get rid of it. What are these little

237
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:34,199
fucking weirdos? Don't use the fucking knife. Oh, bad. Put the fucking sword on. Put on a weapon.

238
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:45,420
You annoying little shits. I swear. I'm just leaving. Get me the fuck out of the way from this.

239
00:56:45,420 --> 00:57:18,170
Go. Let's go. I don't care. Let's fuck these things. Oh, whoa. Am I safe? That sucked. What

240
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:41,530
the fuck is that? I thought I just went the wrong way. Please tell me there's a grace in here and

241
00:57:41,530 --> 00:58:21,130
it's not like somebody's sitting behind the corner. Stoop his ladder. Yes. Thank god. All

242
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:34,489
right, now what? I might go back up. I'm out here. I don't want to go out here yet.

243
00:58:44,300 --> 00:59:11,289
It looks like I could have kept going down. I'm here. I keep going. If you live in there,

244
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:59,349
you're fine. What about over here? Excuse me. Go that way. More rot. That's a legendary.

245
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:10,969
Ah, fuck you. Don't. What did you do? What did you just do? Oh my god. How did you miss that?

246
01:00:16,539 --> 01:00:35,980
I fought a hundred of you. I'll fight you again. Holy shit. His health. Let's try it again.

247
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:50,539
I want to at least get the item. At the very least, I want the item. Those things are

248
01:00:50,539 --> 01:01:01,300
everywhere. We get a post-death interview. Um, I don't, I don't, I don't give interviews.

249
01:01:03,929 --> 01:01:06,570
You have to book me like at least three or four weeks in advance.

250
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:30,940
Sorry. I'm just gonna get the item and then run. Whoa. What the fuck? Why? That's so scary.

251
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,750
I thought he came from the other side. All right. Oh, great. Grave. Glob wards. That's what I want.

252
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:49,219
That's exactly what I was looking for. Holy shit. I can get a plus 10 mambo. I got this.

253
01:01:49,860 --> 01:02:31,980
Fuck. He's gonna knock me off with a blast. I can kill him. I can kill this guy. Just burn.

254
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:39,820
It's a burn fight. You do dark moon. And then after dark moon, you sit up in your chair and

255
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:46,219
you just hope that your ass is not connected to your underwear. And that is now connected as well

256
01:02:46,219 --> 01:03:03,179
to your pants because of just sitting here sweating. Okay. Same deal. We're going to go

257
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,099
up here. I'm going to the moon and then we're switching to the blade and I'm going to be

258
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:12,059
prepared. We're going to wait. Here we go. YouTuber voice, YouTuber gameplay commentary. Here we go.

259
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:15,739
Okay. So we're heading this way. Okay, guys. All right, fellas.

260
01:03:16,460 --> 01:04:04,539
Hey, boys and girls. All right. Cool. Okay. Here we go. What was that? Too far away. Fuck you.

261
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:22,219
What?

262
01:04:31,380 --> 01:05:10,710
It's going to explode. No. Blast you. Blast. It's not funny anymore. It's too far. Quiet.

263
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:16,309
This is a fucking hard game. This enemy is in a really shitty place. He's got a ton of health

264
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:28,739
and he can, he can bounce you off. He can knock you off. Quiet. I got it. It's like the third

265
01:05:28,739 --> 01:05:47,719
attempt. I should try killing it this time. I don't even want those. Who cares? I'm level 180.

266
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:50,519
This shouldn't be this. I'm kidding. People are going to leave and be like, this guy sucks. I'm

267
01:05:50,519 --> 01:06:34,570
135. I'm going to fight him from here. Really? That's really bad. God. Why? Why? Why? Dude,

268
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:45,130
why? This one doesn't count. What's going on? I got to get out of the rod before it builds up.

269
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:48,070
Kill him with it on. Who cares?

270
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:37,420
What was that shit? One of those like puppet hands that came up. Get off you golden seed.

271
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:50,650
That's it. Okay. Well, that's, I mean, how many do I have? I think I have like three,

272
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:59,210
but it's five, right? Totally worth it. Actually, probably worth it.

273
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:02,329
Considering that I think that's the only place you can get those now.

274
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:18,789
Right. I think this is the only place I've seen. I'm just going to go back. There's plenty of other

275
01:08:18,789 --> 01:08:34,380
places you can get. Wait, there are a lot more. Oh, okay. Which bonfire is this?

276
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:45,930
There's at least 10 surplus seeds. That makes sense though. Considering a kind of,

277
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:57,479
I don't have enough to level up. I think so. We've won 20 something.

278
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:05,350
That's close, but it's not there. Well, I'm going to lose all these runes that I just

279
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:43,130
broke for no reason. Wait. Oh, wait. This is like a castle? Like a town? Like what is down here?

280
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:50,600
What is this? This is a castle. This is the halib tree, but it's like a castle.

281
01:09:51,399 --> 01:10:33,289
There's a safe place to go from here. Okay. I could go up. What's up here? Might as well.

282
01:10:38,140 --> 01:11:02,979
Okay. A lot of places to go here. That's high. Did I overshoot that or did I undershoot it?

283
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:17,079
I tried not to overshoot it. Souls are not gone. There's no enemies here.

284
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:25,989
There's going to be stupid fall deaths that are what caused me to lose anything.

285
01:11:36,220 --> 01:12:00,600
Okay. Come on. Chonished. I'm going to fuck it up. What the? Did I go? I went, I went through it.

286
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,359
My character went through it. I literally went through it. He phased through it.

287
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:16,779
He just did the exact same thing. Bro. I'm trying to land on the little banister thing.

288
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:29,079
I did. I undershoot it. I like went. I got to go a little bit further. Hurry up. Let's go.

289
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:43,819
My God. I'm rushing now because I don't want to fucking run over the stupid twigs anymore.

290
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:51,880
I don't want to like walk across the tightrope anymore.

291
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:01,460
I can't like this in games. Not like this where it's just like, okay, you got to go like that way

292
01:13:01,939 --> 01:13:05,539
and then down that way and then that way. And then you where you were. Oh, just get,

293
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:09,619
I want to just drive a car there. I just want to get in a fucking car and drive here.

294
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:34,140
Give me in a plane and just fly it there. Just fly. Just speed hack it. I don't need the ruins.

295
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:54,859
Whatever. I can go walk. How are you? I was in the middle of an animation. That's not fair. What?

296
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:59,050
I was in the middle of an opening animation. That's not, that's not how that works.

297
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:04,760
What's the item? What's the item? Did he take it?

298
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:19,430
What's the item? It didn't show up on my screen. What is it? What is it? What is it?

299
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:26,810
You got it. What was it? I didn't even, it didn't even show up on the screen.

300
01:14:27,449 --> 01:14:45,699
Is it talisman? Yes. Dragon crest. Enormously boost physical damage negation.

301
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,680
Legendary talisman of wrought iron depicting a massive ancient dragon.

302
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:55,180
The ancient dragons who ruled in the prehistoric era before the urd tree

303
01:14:55,819 --> 01:15:01,500
would protect their lord as a wall of living rock. And so it is that the shape of the dragon

304
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:18,229
has become symbolic of all manner of protection. He's pretty good. He's very good. Okay. Um,

305
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:36,729
this deck is still down there that I said you can't even see me. You threw the guy.

306
01:15:36,729 --> 01:16:10,390
What? My God, you're so annoying. Get out of there. This guy's got to die right now.

307
01:16:11,029 --> 01:17:27,859
They're flying. I just go down. You lost. Yeah. The guy shoved me. Who's next to me? The ledges.

308
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:36,729
I don't have anything left in there.

309
01:17:39,369 --> 01:18:10,869
My fucking socks. That was so far too. Jesus. To go back to the stinky dragon spot. Um,

310
01:18:10,869 --> 01:18:16,789
I'm, I have progress this way. I need to, I want to get out of this piece of shit before I go back

311
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:24,010
to the rot village. Okay. I'm getting out of this piece of crap. I know I just, I said a little bit

312
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:45,270
of swear word there, but that was crap. Okay. What is this? I don't know. We're taking it though.

313
01:18:45,270 --> 01:19:34,100
This one's going so fast. Oh shit. Nice. Lost store. All right. Here's a boss. What do we got?

314
01:19:34,100 --> 01:20:24,859
Here we go. Cut scene. Everybody quiet. Oh, running. Great. Go run and kick that away.

315
01:20:24,859 --> 01:20:28,060
That's like a gun in a movie where it like gets kicked away and everyone tries to go get it.

316
01:20:28,060 --> 01:21:28,979
As I awaited his return, heed my words. I am millennia blade of Mickeler feet.

317
01:21:30,539 --> 01:21:37,350
I am Jerma. Sword of everyone. Hey, you get to do what I do. That's not fair.

318
01:21:37,350 --> 01:22:16,069
Fuck you. How dare you. God, that hurts. She's healing.

319
01:22:16,550 --> 01:23:23,670
Do something. Come on. Nice. Bombo. Good. Good job. Very good.

320
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:57,850
Fucking healing shit. I caught this. Dude, she's healing off of them. She's going back up full L.

321
01:23:59,189 --> 01:24:14,819
Okay. Um, he's back up full HB. I'm fucking flabbergasted. Uh, so what we have to do here

322
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:29,369
is we have to, uh, go back to full fucking health. Um, excuse X. It's coming out of my mouth.

323
01:24:29,369 --> 01:25:01,529
Excuse me. I'm dead. So I didn't even hurt the boss. Did the boss was not even injured at all.

324
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:16,149
Bombo seems like free health in a way. I'm very curious how I'm going to do this. He's

325
01:25:16,149 --> 01:26:04,460
to dodge every attack. Okay. Let's go. Oh, that's a bad, not bad idea. No magic.

326
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:20,140
Too slow. It's too slow. How long does it do that for sword? Like clicks up. Oh, yikes.

327
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:55,880
Boys and girls, baby rattles going to turn out to be quite a good pick here.

328
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:02,630
Oh, boys and girls, baby rattle is the weapon of choice.

329
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:27,989
You can't stand in the air that long. Is this a fucking cartoon? Is this a cartoon?

330
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:39,210
She was in the air. She jumped in the air and stood there up in the air. I was expecting her

331
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:45,770
to hold a fucking sign that just said like, Oh, and then fall. What the hell was that?

332
01:27:46,489 --> 01:27:55,979
Fucking goddamn cartoon shit. All right. Baby rattle is unbelievable here because it

333
01:28:12,979 --> 01:29:24,699
is sloppy. Very sloppy. Oh my fucking God. We're back to full fucking health.

334
01:29:25,420 --> 01:30:24,970
I'm going to do something fucking weird like this. That was weird. Oh my God. All right. Even

335
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:28,489
though she's going to heal, I think Bombo's got to come out. We also might have to upgrade

336
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:59,960
Bombo to level 10. Let's go Bombo. Very good start. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that

337
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:28,840
stagger. No, fuck. There it is. Nice. Good hit. Is this even doing anything?

338
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:44,890
She's healing off of them. Oh my God. She's going to heal. Okay. So summons are not probably not

339
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:58,630
good because she's just going to farm health on them. Oh, that's right. Okay. If I'm not going

340
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:11,590
to be doing that much spells and we need to wait like jump. Do I have like a, what should I do here?

341
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:25,800
Shield one. I think it's really heavy though. Enormously boosts physical damage negation.

342
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:32,819
What about, um, FP? I don't really necessarily care about potentially like sorceries. What about

343
01:32:33,859 --> 01:32:38,279
does it matter? Does she do magic damage or something? What is she doing? Rod?

344
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:57,829
Raid? I don't see. Is there a raid? No, it's physical. Okay. So

345
01:32:58,869 --> 01:33:04,710
arch attacks, stamina reducing attacks. Maybe it's HP. Just greatly raise max HP.

346
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:16,220
That seems kind of cool. All right. Let me try that. And I'm also going to move flasks around.

347
01:33:16,779 --> 01:33:28,380
Let me just try it. Just purely trying to fight rune arc. I am not going to use a rune arc yet

348
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:38,149
because I'm not confident enough that I'm not going to die in 13 seconds. I also probably

349
01:33:38,149 --> 01:34:11,369
should change my wondrous physique as well. All right, let's go. No summons. Fuck you. Fuck you.

350
01:34:11,369 --> 01:36:07,739
Fuck you. Thank God. Eat shit. Hey. Top myself off. Oh shit. No. No. My God. Fuck. Jesus Christ.

351
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:15,699
Oh, that was so good too. Oh, that sucks. Holy shit. This is unbearable. What?

352
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:31,300
One mistake and it's over. That was a really clean like first minute or two. Holy shit.

353
01:36:33,979 --> 01:36:43,829
If you one wrong input, it's over. Holy fucking moly. All right. Come on. Holy moly.

354
01:36:44,470 --> 01:37:02,199
It's got to be fucking aggressive by the aggressive. That's sloppy fucking beginning.

355
01:37:02,199 --> 01:37:23,289
That's sloppy shit right there. I had no stamina to dodge. Quiet. Yikes, man. She's

356
01:37:23,289 --> 01:37:36,890
already back to fucking full health. Is this even possible to beat? Is this even physically

357
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:52,100
completable? No one's beat this in the world. I saw the achievement pop up. It's at 0.0%.

358
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:58,020
I was wondering. I thought it was a bug or something. 0.0% of people have beat this.

359
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:24,470
Geez. We're that smart to get away from that. God. It's okay. When she goes shriek,

360
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:27,829
you got to just get away. Just dodge right immediately. Right when you hear the sound.

361
01:38:44,949 --> 01:38:56,140
Fuck you. Oh fucking hell. You have to be perfect at this fight. Oh my God, dude.

362
01:38:57,020 --> 01:39:30,229
This is going to take 10 hours of memorizing this whole fight without a doubt. What? Didn't swing.

363
01:39:30,949 --> 01:39:57,779
It's so long. Like one, two, three, four seconds. Stop fucking swinging. Oh my God.

364
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:16,579
Holy shit, this is insane. Yeah, I'm trying, man. This is the boss that people said. Some people

365
01:40:16,579 --> 01:40:27,800
took like 10 days on this person. Okay. I'm doing it. It's probably a phase two as well. This is

366
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:34,859
going to be so awful, isn't it? We're throwing caution to the goddamn wind.

367
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:38,500
We're doing a full on burger boy technique right now.

368
01:40:45,659 --> 01:41:02,279
Consumables? Are you guys actually voting to see if I'm going to do this in 15 tries?

369
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:10,119
Add a zero. 15 tries? No. No, I'm telling you, this is going to be like a hundred.

370
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:16,489
I don't know how I would have voted for that one. All right, here we go.

371
01:41:17,210 --> 01:42:05,560
You fucking idiot. Seriously? Really? Shit.

372
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:11,750
What? There's a lot of time to swing after that.

373
01:42:18,619 --> 01:42:35,819
That was the one thing you could have done to avoid that. No fucking way. Not a chance now.

374
01:42:35,819 --> 01:42:46,100
Oh my fucking Lord. I didn't get grabbed. I thought I did. What is this? Did she dodge this?

375
01:42:47,380 --> 01:43:25,720
Oh, there's no fucking panel left. Hold on a minute. I've got an idea. I have an idea.

376
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:47,779
This is going to work. We're doing. Okay. Watch this shit. Randy's moon. And we're going.

377
01:43:47,779 --> 01:43:52,100
I'm just going to bully. I think I can actually bring out serpent for this.

378
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,260
I'm going hard for this one. Here we go. This is going to be a nightmare, but let's do it.

379
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:10,899
Here we go. You guys ready for a nightmare? Moon. Three. Or two. I will take two. Two moons?

380
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,600
Oh my God. Just two moons. Just sit her into a moon.

381
01:44:22,859 --> 01:44:28,409
Okay. All right. All right. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. We have to bully immediately.

382
01:44:28,409 --> 01:44:43,850
Don't let her swing. Don't let her swing. Oh my God. What is that? What just happened?

383
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:51,340
I don't even know what happened. She got mad. Oh, that's the play though. That's going to work.

384
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:01,020
That is the play. It's just get in there and just absolutely stagger and bully.

385
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:30,439
Let's do it. She's in there somewhere. All right. Get her. Get her. Get her. Get her.

386
01:45:30,439 --> 01:45:33,479
Don't let her do anything weird. Don't let her do anything weird. Get her.

387
01:45:37,079 --> 01:45:42,680
Burger Boy technique. All right. Back up. Back up. No reason to get killed here.

388
01:45:43,399 --> 01:45:48,039
We're going full Burger Boy. Who cares? Just kill her.

389
01:46:09,609 --> 01:46:16,869
Back up. Back up. There's no way this works, right? There's no way. There's a phase two in there.

390
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:26,539
Ow. My face. Just phase two. This is going to be a phase two. This is going to be a phase two.

391
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:31,109
Oh, she's going to rip her arm off. She's going to turn into a zombie.

392
01:46:33,699 --> 01:46:38,579
She's going to turn into a monster. It's a fucking phase two fight. I was so confident for no reason.

393
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:48,710
God damn it. Okay. So that works for phase one. Phase...

394
01:46:49,859 --> 01:46:55,539
What do you mean no way? That was it? No. No, it's not. Why would there be a cut scene?

395
01:46:59,939 --> 01:47:06,649
That works for phase one. Okay. That's very effective for phase one.

396
01:47:06,649 --> 01:47:09,289
But oh God. I knew it. Right. There's no way.

397
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:40,760
Okay. Bombo, I think we're going to have to try a little harder. Bombo, you and me. Good luck.

398
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:13,979
Bombo, it's been a pleasure doing business with you. What the fuck? She exploded.

399
01:48:15,819 --> 01:48:42,520
Bombo. Bombo, don't go in there. Bombo. Bombo, no. My game is frozen.

400
01:48:43,319 --> 01:49:10,539
Okay. Well, we have a reliable way to get to... Let's let's do this smartly. I want more spell

401
01:49:10,539 --> 01:49:22,619
damage. Less... I want sorceries. Boosting sorceries. Get Bombo to 10. Yes. That's exactly what we're

402
01:49:22,619 --> 01:49:32,550
going to do right now. Do I have any runes? I don't. How much does it cost to get you to 10?

403
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:50,539
And use a rune arc? Still doing that. Okay. Wait, I can't see you. Wait, I gotta sell.

404
01:49:51,180 --> 01:50:01,539
I gotta sell something. I'm thinking rune arc. Get Bombo to 10. I need to just sell like some

405
01:50:01,539 --> 01:50:14,600
route. What do I have? No junk. How much does it cost? Fuck. Shit. I just gotta go kill a few

406
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:22,229
things. Sell your... Do not sell the grease. Do I have a lord's rune? I didn't see it. Yeah,

407
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:32,970
I don't have it. I'm just gonna go kill a couple things. Use rune arcs. Uh, let me just go here.

408
01:50:32,970 --> 01:50:42,840
This'll be easy. That... That fight is crazy. It's really just... I honestly... No, no, no. We're not...

409
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:50,039
We're not just like dodging around and dashing around. Nope. That is a DPS race. That is a kill

410
01:50:50,039 --> 01:50:58,899
her as fast as possible. Don't let her do any moves. Where's an easy place for me to get? Oh,

411
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:07,270
I know. That mog place. Where is it? It's like right here somewhere. All right.

412
01:51:08,229 --> 01:51:16,899
Dermot, you're never going to beat this boss. I feel like I got... I feel like I got close enough.

413
01:51:16,899 --> 01:51:42,600
I think it's... I think I can do it. All I need is like 10 bombs. But yeah, the sorcery boosting

414
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:50,739
talisman... If I just go for straight up just DPS, go for it. I think it's gonna be pretty

415
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:59,859
possible. I think it's gonna be okay. I also think that I need mana. Eels are very good, but

416
01:51:59,859 --> 01:52:06,710
I don't want to run out, because that would be a disaster if I did. Okay, let's go get Mambo to 10.

417
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:32,500
There you are. Here we go. Mambo plus 10. I guess I had more

418
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:39,050
runes than I needed. We're also going to take a rune arc. Wait, what do I have on for a rune right

419
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:57,029
now? What's the best one I can put on for this? Odric is good. HP, FP, and stamina. I feel like

420
01:52:57,029 --> 01:53:22,260
that's not bad. Greatly raises max HP. I'm gonna... I'll try Redan's. That's not very... That's not

421
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:33,109
that much. It doesn't seem like very much. Okay, well, let's go for it. I am as prepared as I'm

422
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:40,569
going to be at this point. Morgoth's is better. Well, I got this on right now. Redan's sucks.

423
01:53:43,930 --> 01:54:03,750
All right, it's... Right here. Use Godric's. I mean, I already used it. Okay, here we go.

424
01:54:04,310 --> 01:54:09,609
Let's try it. The same technique. Getting in there, and we are just bully, bully, bully, bully,

425
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:14,329
bully. Don't do anything else. Bully. Bully. That's it. We're not doing it. We're just bullying.

426
01:54:29,899 --> 01:55:09,859
Get in there. Stagger. Come on. Keep it up. Get in. And go. Good. Good. Mambo, help.

427
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:33,270
Oh, she did it three times in a row. She did that same dumbass move two or three times in a row.

428
01:55:33,909 --> 01:56:19,159
I lost the rune arc. I don't even need it. Fuck it. I don't want it. Not that one. Here we go.

429
01:56:19,159 --> 01:56:49,529
Get it. Mambo, you got to get any closer, man. Come on. Fucking Jesus. Not a good... This is a bad

430
01:56:49,529 --> 01:57:32,140
start. You did that move so early. Zone, zone. Good zone, Mambo. Good zoning. Oh, my God. She

431
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:57,909
just kicked the shit out of him. Oh, please. Nice. God damn it. He's dead. Okay. All right. We got

432
01:57:57,909 --> 01:58:30,949
to phase two for the second time. I'm ready. Oh, my God. It explodes. What the fuck? What the fuck?

433
01:58:30,949 --> 01:58:45,560
She doesn't come down. She stays up there. I'm just going to run. I saw her come down,

434
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:52,779
but that was just a stupid fucking phantom. All right. No more rune arcs until I can reliably

435
01:58:52,779 --> 01:59:01,659
know what she's going to do in phase two. This is... Oh, my goodness. This is fucking awkward.

436
01:59:07,399 --> 01:59:26,279
Get that backwards. I just couldn't fucking see. I'll be honest. There's so much red shit on the

437
01:59:26,279 --> 01:59:53,270
screen. We got to keep Mambo alive. That's the stupidest fucking move we've ever made.

438
01:59:56,970 --> 02:00:06,520
Do you just have to turn around and run? It does it three times. There's no way you can get her.

439
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:13,020
You cannot dodge that. You just turn around and run. There's so many attack animations in

440
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:36,300
one second. What's that fucking horse shit? Come on. I need you to get in there.

441
02:00:46,500 --> 02:01:08,489
Good start. Run. It happened so quickly. That move happened so fast. How are you supposed to do that?

442
02:01:14,619 --> 02:01:28,119
Holy... That's stupid. If she goes in the air, just run. Dumbass shit right there. That is dumbass

443
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:42,250
shit. Okay, if she goes in the air, run across the entire game. Okay, I got it.

444
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:58,699
If she went in the air for that, it's a different move. Mambo, I need you over here.

445
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:47,260
Now I'm paranoid that she's going to do it. Zoning. Back up. No, I didn't. She's actually

446
02:02:47,260 --> 02:03:09,739
doing it to Mambo. It's all right. Poor Mambo. Oh, my God. I need Mambo for phase two so bad.

447
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:25,850
Come on, miss the fucking stun. She's right. It's so intense. It's hard to even fucking pay

448
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:32,600
attention. There's so much going on that she can do. Holy shit. It's so difficult to pay attention

449
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:37,130
to that. It's just like, oh, my God. She's in the air and then it's too late. It's like your brain

450
02:03:37,130 --> 02:04:25,239
is like, oh, fuck. Okay, too late. Let's try it again. This is perfect. No, it's not. No, fucking

451
02:04:25,239 --> 02:04:32,020
too late. Oh, my God. Damn it. Please. Thank God she didn't kill Mambo with that. That's actually

452
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:58,859
good. Keep her there. Get her, Mambo. Come on. Jesus. No. Mambo, stop her. Stop her, please.

453
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:21,899
This is un-fucking-believably difficult. They're going to nerf this one, too.

454
02:05:22,779 --> 02:05:26,859
They're going to fight both these bosses, Verdan and this one, before they fucking nerf it twice.

455
02:05:45,350 --> 02:06:12,680
Didn't get her. It's actually really hard to see. My God. That sucks. Mambo's going to die.

456
02:06:12,840 --> 02:07:13,909
Really quick. Dude. Excuse me. I ran the whole fucking time. Hey. Whoa. Is she going to go in

457
02:07:13,909 --> 02:07:40,119
the air? I'm so fucking afraid she's going to go in the air and ruin the whole thing. I need you

458
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:52,380
for phase two. She's still alive. What the hell? She's fucking healing. Damn it, man. That's such

459
02:07:52,380 --> 02:08:08,729
a shit mechanic. Oh, my God. I can't fucking kill her. All right. Now what do I do?

460
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:28,039
Oh, my God. Okay. So she goes in the air. She comes down and then she explodes. How many seconds

461
02:08:28,039 --> 02:08:51,050
later? Two? Will that still hit you if you roll? So you have to just do like two good perfect dodges.

462
02:08:52,489 --> 02:08:54,489
I'm going to start to hear this fucking music in my head.

463
02:08:56,779 --> 02:09:36,390
Don't go in the air. I have nowhere to run. Oh, my God. She's coming for me.

464
02:09:36,949 --> 02:10:23,850
What the fuck? I don't know where she's going. No. He got it. All right. Come on. Dodge. It's

465
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:35,029
going to be a good dodge. Fuck. There's Scarlet Rye everywhere. There's Scarlet Rye all over me.

466
02:10:45,819 --> 02:11:19,340
Is it the same move that she does? I don't know, dude. Oh, no. Oh, no. She does it. Oh, no.

467
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:28,409
Oh, she does two different things. She goes in the air now. She does two of those. She hung up

468
02:11:28,409 --> 02:11:39,000
and didn't do it. Oh, my goodness. What level am I? 135. Should I just come back here at like

469
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:47,029
180 and just kill her? She does five different things. I have to float it. I'm just running

470
02:11:47,029 --> 02:12:22,170
every time. This sucks. This sucks so bad. You can't. You can't. I need more bully from you.

471
02:12:23,130 --> 02:12:29,289
Oh, she's doing it. That's so, dude. I got to fucking seriously. I honestly like it's like,

472
02:12:29,289 --> 02:12:35,020
holy shit. I just like you get you get so into the fight and it's just so much going on.

473
02:12:35,579 --> 02:12:38,859
So much fucking colors on the screen that like she goes in the air and it's like, oh, fuck.

474
02:12:39,739 --> 02:12:42,699
I'm just going to shoot me in the face with the cannon. I can't fucking do anything.

475
02:12:46,579 --> 02:12:49,140
Use the mimic tear. They nerfed that motherfucker. It's not worth it.

476
02:12:55,930 --> 02:13:01,289
This is the strategy for phase two. God, I have no fucking goddamn idea how you're supposed to

477
02:13:01,289 --> 02:13:07,109
reliably do that. This is just I don't think I don't know how to fucking do that. Dude,

478
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:11,750
some of these like speed run like no damage runs. Oh, my God. This is going to suck. Absolute

479
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:35,270
asshole. It's going to be fucking horrible. Dude, even when you fucking run, it don't matter.

480
02:13:35,270 --> 02:14:11,739
I'm terrified. We're going in the air. If you're mid attack animation like this, it's fucking

481
02:14:11,739 --> 02:15:13,029
horrible. Oh, come on. Get out of here. All right. Come on. Get it. Don't let her go in the air.

482
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:32,810
Consistent. God, you piece of shit. Just get hit. Um, thank you, mom. I can't fucking hit her.

483
02:15:33,449 --> 02:16:10,020
Can I go near her? Where is she? I have no stamina to fucking move away from her.

484
02:16:11,739 --> 02:16:27,260
I'm out of fucking stamina. Oh, no way, man. Oh, shit. I don't. I'm fucking dead. Oh, my God.

485
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:46,860
I ran out of stamina. Use a shield. Oh, my God. That sucked. How much stamina do I have?

486
02:16:47,420 --> 02:16:55,559
20 endurance. Yeah, but I need to try the boys. I feel like the boys are going to be free food.

487
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:11,719
Use the boom blade. I'm not even I don't I don't know, man. I got to like get to phase two and not

488
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:17,879
ever spam that move the first five seconds. Like I need to be I got to see what she does in that

489
02:17:17,879 --> 02:17:21,479
encounter. I'm just going to run away from her. If I get to phase two here, I'm literally I'm

490
02:17:21,479 --> 02:17:24,440
not going to attack. I'm literally going to run around in a circle and see what she does.

491
02:17:25,559 --> 02:17:29,879
And what was so un-fucking-variable that like even if you're remotely close, you're fucked.

492
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:47,780
Jesus, the timing is so fucked up. This is the hardest boss of any from fucking without a doubt

493
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:53,979
in my mind. Million percent. I thought the end of Sekiro was fucking horrible. At least like I had

494
02:17:53,979 --> 02:18:02,180
a at least you can like fucking you have like a button to stop attacks. I think this takes the

495
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:14,780
cake. Like that L1. This is a Sekiro boss without the parry mechanic. I think she accidentally got

496
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:25,639
in this fucking game. I don't think she's supposed to be here. They like accidentally put the wrong

497
02:18:25,639 --> 02:19:56,420
asset in here. I'm so paranoid of that move. I don't even want to like fight her. Dude, fuck you

498
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:06,680
with this fucking gap closing bullshit. Oh, come on now. God damn it. All these gap closes. Where's

499
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:37,829
my fucking Sekiro L1? Wrong game. Wrong game from software. Wrong game. He's going crazy. I'm

500
02:20:37,829 --> 02:20:43,110
going to turn him out, man. Fuck me. Fuck. I'm going to hack my game and fucking get 10,000 damage.

501
02:20:43,110 --> 02:21:08,540
I'm just going to kill her with one hit. Get her in the fire. Ugly. Ugly. She's going to go in the air.

502
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:13,260
I just know it. It's just like, fuck, you don't know when she's going to go in the goddamn air.

503
02:21:14,139 --> 02:21:36,040
And it's like, man, you better not be within fucking 100 yards of her. Fucking leave me alone.

504
02:21:36,040 --> 02:22:52,819
Jesus Christ. I was stupid, but I'm going to do it. No. Why did that not stagger? Oh, fuck. Come on.

505
02:22:52,819 --> 02:23:09,000
No. Get back. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up. All right. What are you? What are your moves?

506
02:23:09,799 --> 02:23:21,180
What are your moves? Oh my God. She's doing that thing. It's different. What? That was different.

507
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:45,290
She didn't do the thing. That was different. No attack. Please. New moves so I can learn what

508
02:23:45,290 --> 02:24:04,420
you do. Please get away from me. I'm such a coward. I don't care. Oh, it's over. Goodbye. Dude.

509
02:24:06,700 --> 02:24:16,870
My genuine scared face. There's not even enough time for me to change to my other potions. You

510
02:24:16,870 --> 02:24:30,979
know what I mean? Like, fuck this. It's more, it's like a lot, it's been really drifty and floating.

511
02:24:31,940 --> 02:25:07,180
Please. Shit. Shit. Oh my God. There's no time. Oh my God. What are you supposed to do? There's

512
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:22,180
no time. There's no time. There's no time. There's no time. By the time she finishes that move,

513
02:25:22,819 --> 02:25:32,280
she's doing it again. What the fuck, dude? You should use your melee art. Dude, I'm going to do

514
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:42,860
that and die instantly. I don't think I can do, I think that move is too slow. I think I just have

515
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:53,860
to fight her. Fucking drugs were they taking when they made this, by the way? Oh, here's a good idea.

516
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:59,139
A fight where the boss heals every time she hits you. Oh, and by the way, there's a move that

517
02:25:59,139 --> 02:26:05,059
goes across the entire fucking boss area. She's got no stamina bar. She swings faster than all

518
02:26:05,059 --> 02:26:11,850
the bosses in Sekiro. Were they, were they smoking crack when they made this? How much crack were

519
02:26:11,850 --> 02:27:06,409
they on? This is crack. All right, settle down. I'm fine. She's going to do it. She's going to do it.

520
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:12,870
She's just, she wants to do it so badly. A little, the math problem going on in her little fucking

521
02:27:12,870 --> 02:27:49,420
brain is being like, should I do the thing? Maybe. Nice job. Oh, killer quick. She annihilated him.

522
02:27:49,420 --> 02:28:10,329
She fucking annihilated him, man. I'm so paranoid that she's going to go in the air and it's over.

523
02:28:11,290 --> 02:29:18,020
Oh my God, it's over. Oh my God, that's so broken. Oh my God. I even tried to run, dude.

524
02:29:23,899 --> 02:29:27,899
Mambo phase two, that's probably, but I gotta get through phase one.

525
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:39,100
Mambo is going to stay alive for phase two. He didn't run. Guys, she does a move that takes like

526
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:46,149
12 seconds to end. And she jumps in the air and does it within like half a second. If you're

527
02:29:46,149 --> 02:29:53,030
already in the gap, it's fucking over. And when, if you're too far away, you can't fight her.

528
02:29:53,030 --> 02:30:05,620
If you're too close, you're fucked. How do you win? What's the strat? I need to get a shield.

529
02:30:05,620 --> 02:30:18,219
Guys, my dude, my dude can't fucking handle it. I think I need Mambo for phase one. Otherwise,

530
02:30:18,219 --> 02:30:49,500
I don't know if I can reliably get through this. Bro, I can't see you when you're doing that in

531
02:30:49,500 --> 02:31:13,530
front of me. Hit her please, Mambo. Please do your little stretchy thing and hit her. Don't let her

532
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:43,989
get any mana off you. No, she's building mana. Don't let her, I'll get her. No shit. Oh no.

533
02:31:44,870 --> 02:32:42,620
Mambo get her. There are other people in this fight, you know. What the fuck?

534
02:32:42,620 --> 02:33:13,799
No fucking shot. No fucking shot. No shot. No shot. That's not possible. She runs faster than

535
02:33:13,799 --> 02:33:22,219
you. She does more moves per second than you can move. She's got the biggest gap closers of anybody

536
02:33:22,219 --> 02:33:37,850
I've ever seen. What a piece of shit. Look shit faced. I look fucking drunk right now.

537
02:33:37,850 --> 02:33:43,049
Dude, I know. Okay, I understand. Like just dodge, just dodge. Being perfect in a soul is like,

538
02:33:43,049 --> 02:33:48,329
this is a fucking from software game. Why am I saying that? You can't be perfect, man. Like,

539
02:33:48,329 --> 02:33:57,190
it's just too hard. It's too much. But even if you were perfect, I want to like watch that clip

540
02:33:57,190 --> 02:34:06,379
of what just happened. Because goddamn, it's like attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,

541
02:34:06,379 --> 02:34:11,819
attack, attack. It's not time to do anything. You can't, you physically cannot do anything

542
02:34:11,819 --> 02:34:20,200
because I just get hit. Watch somebody do a no hit of this. They're, they're fucking, they're,

543
02:34:20,200 --> 02:35:05,610
they're working in slow motion. I already went over that. Oh fuck me. Thank god. I love when he

544
02:35:05,610 --> 02:35:35,989
hits her. It sounds like a trash can lid. He's using a trash can. No, don't go for me, please.

545
02:35:36,950 --> 02:35:47,270
I'll never turn you back on mombo. Big fucking mistake. I don't have the stamina. I might have.

546
02:36:05,020 --> 02:37:06,069
Oh shit. Fine. Oh boy. Bro. This is shit. Oh damn it. Fuck you, dude. Jesus Christ.

547
02:37:06,069 --> 02:37:29,479
What the fuck? What? Panic roll. Those are the amount of rolls you have to do to not get hit by

548
02:37:29,479 --> 02:37:44,120
that dumb fucking. That's so fucking annoying. This piece of shit is dead eventually. And we're

549
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:53,020
going to eat one of these. Oh, I'm so mad. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks. This sucks.

550
02:37:53,979 --> 02:38:53,780
I had no stamina to run. I hate when you do this shit. I can do something. Do something. What are

551
02:38:53,780 --> 02:39:48,500
you a player in PVP? Fuck off. I thought he just cut her head off. Please help me and kill her.

552
02:39:48,500 --> 02:40:37,620
Please help me. Get out of the rock. Get out of the rock. Fuck you. Oh fuck. It's so much slower.

553
02:40:38,500 --> 02:41:15,450
Oh my god. I thought it was the yellow one. Is it? What one is it? Dude, the fact that she goes in

554
02:41:15,610 --> 02:41:20,329
the air and she does two different fucking moves. She does the like, here I am floating.

555
02:41:22,170 --> 02:41:31,000
Or, or it's like, whoosh. How are you supposed to tell? How are you supposed to tell?

556
02:41:31,559 --> 02:41:35,719
How are you supposed to fucking tell? Different poses. Oh yeah. She goes, instead of going like

557
02:41:35,719 --> 02:42:07,430
this, she goes like this. This is stupid. I think it's a hundred degrees in this room.

558
02:42:08,389 --> 02:42:17,959
I'm like being cooked in here. I'm being cooked alive in here. If there was a piece of meat on my

559
02:42:17,959 --> 02:42:23,260
shoulder, it would be turning brown. It would be, it would be like browning. It would be like, oh,

560
02:42:23,260 --> 02:44:48,020
I could probably eat it. This fight sucks. Oh fuck. God damn it. I don't know how many fucking

561
02:44:48,020 --> 02:44:55,299
people do that. And she's doing the fucking thing again. Oh my god. I couldn't even see.

562
02:44:56,260 --> 02:45:15,899
Goodness. Too many moves. They're going to take away one of those swings. It's so fucked up.

563
02:45:19,579 --> 02:45:34,389
Mambo for phase two only. I'll try that. Can I even do that though? I feel like I'm gonna get my ass

564
02:45:34,389 --> 02:45:42,090
kicked right now. No, I don't want to listen. I'm not using the stupid mimic tier. Quiet.

565
02:45:43,370 --> 02:46:56,489
I demand silence. Oh fuck. No, I forgot what that move was for a second. Yeah. I forgot. I like

566
02:46:56,489 --> 02:47:00,809
forgot that because I didn't have Mambo. Like this is the first time I have seen and heard

567
02:47:00,889 --> 02:47:11,100
without Mambo. And like, I just forgot. So when From Software makes another game,

568
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:17,719
right? What are they? What do they do? Did they just? Okay. Does the next game? It's like,

569
02:47:17,719 --> 02:47:21,829
oh, we have to do something harder than millennia. The two hands come out of the

570
02:47:21,829 --> 02:47:28,729
fucking screen and just choke you and just push on your trachea. What's next? What do they do?

571
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:34,920
You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, I'm at the final boss. Oh, wow. One of the final bosses of,

572
02:47:35,559 --> 02:47:44,680
of, uh, just slash arc. Wow. I'm here. Let's see about these hands. Whoa, guys, do you see these

573
02:47:44,680 --> 02:48:07,780
hands? Oh, I dodged. Fight the fucking hands. What's next? Like, what the fuck is next?

574
02:48:11,850 --> 02:48:20,170
Oh, yeah. From Software's new game is called Nut Kick. Oh, oh, like something just kicks me

575
02:48:20,170 --> 02:48:29,700
in the balls from under the desk. What else are they going to do? How are they going to do

576
02:48:29,700 --> 02:48:50,459
anything else? It spells in here. It fucking spells in here. I can tell on you right now. It

577
02:48:50,459 --> 02:49:11,290
stinks in here. Not kidding. No, I didn't shit my pants. Imagine setting up. Oh, yeah. This game,

578
02:49:11,290 --> 02:49:16,569
Nut Kick. Yeah. It's like a thing down here. I just like sit there and here comes the boss.

579
02:49:17,530 --> 02:49:27,909
Why would you set that up? Why would you wouldn't even buy it? Oh, fuck. I'm going to die.

580
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:49,209
I'm fucking dead. This one's a real try right here. Everyone warned me. Oh, hey, dude. I know

581
02:49:49,209 --> 02:49:53,850
you're like, yeah. Hey, by the way, like going there at 150, by the way, don't, hey, listen,

582
02:49:53,850 --> 02:49:58,090
fucking do. Don't listen to these fucking idiots in the chat, man. I'm telling you,

583
02:49:58,809 --> 02:50:03,850
be a fucking level 150. Get your fucking vigor up to fucking like 60. That's how I did it,

584
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:07,370
dude. Don't fucking listen to these dudes. They're trying to get you killed and they think it's funny

585
02:50:07,370 --> 02:50:13,209
when you die. Look, trust me, I'm a fucking nut kick pro. I just sit there and let it kick me.

586
02:50:15,110 --> 02:50:22,379
Listen to me. I got all the fucking tips. I did world first get a nut kick fucking a hundred times.

587
02:50:23,879 --> 02:50:32,409
Yeah, that's me. I got that. I got that. I got that. Why am I just doing

588
02:50:32,729 --> 02:50:36,090
this? I think I might be out of it. I think I might have to take a break.

589
02:50:36,090 --> 02:51:14,760
This might be break time. Oh, here it comes. Oh, I'm going to go for the record.

590
02:51:46,250 --> 02:52:00,260
I'm going to turn the fan up. Okay. So what went wrong there? There's too many, so many memes

591
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:08,969
tonight. Oh, sorry. G four rated. Are you still here? I hope not. I hope that. I hope not. Thanks

592
02:52:08,969 --> 02:52:14,250
for the brain. That's like an hour and a half ago. That was two hours ago. My thing. Am I saying

593
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:22,329
thanks for the raid to G four, two and a half fucking hours later. Are you drunk? We'll bring

594
02:52:22,329 --> 02:52:28,409
it out. Mambo prefers wrong is whatever. I'm pissed. It was four hours ago. How long have I been here?

595
02:52:29,770 --> 02:53:01,850
Come on, Mambo, get in there. That actually is. Oh, no, she's got it. That sucks when she does it

596
02:53:01,850 --> 02:53:19,030
to Mambo because then Mambo is not going to be around for the second phase. She's almost back

597
02:53:19,030 --> 02:55:32,709
to full health again. Again. Oh, come on. Oh my God. I couldn't. I'm trying to change my fucking

598
02:55:32,709 --> 02:55:43,620
sword. Oh my God, dude. Like holding. Like I got a fucking complaint. Like holding Y and hit R one

599
02:55:43,620 --> 02:55:49,479
to go to the two hand man. Sometimes like it just like fucking is weird. It doesn't like happen in

600
02:55:49,479 --> 02:55:54,120
the lower left. It doesn't like say, oh, you're holding Y. It just thinks you're tapping Y.

601
02:55:55,079 --> 02:56:21,479
I mean, like you have to switch your weapon. You have to like one. It's like a full second

602
02:56:21,479 --> 02:56:48,870
that you have to hold it. It's like, hold. There it is. Hold. There it is. You're already running.

603
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:54,950
What's this bullshit? You never run. You knew I used a rune arc. You piece of shit. Shit. Shit.

604
02:56:55,510 --> 02:57:20,700
Shit. Shit. What was that? You piece of shit. You missed. I'm going to shit my pants.

605
02:57:21,899 --> 02:57:42,950
I give this one more try and I'm going to do it. What time is it? Don't shit your pants. I'm done

606
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:47,829
if I want to. And I might, I just might. I might just fucking, you know what I mean? Like just

607
02:57:48,790 --> 02:58:38,709
you can't see what's happening in that fight. I'm just freaking out, man. What are you doing?

608
02:58:38,709 --> 02:58:55,139
Don't do it. One of us has to fucking do something. So no, I forgot. I'm so I can't,

609
02:58:56,250 --> 02:59:01,129
I can't even fucking man. That's like my brain is just like, for some reason I thought like she was

610
02:59:01,129 --> 02:59:21,700
in phase two was going to do the swoop. Last one. This is the last one. This is ridiculous.

611
02:59:24,979 --> 02:59:49,610
This is like truly a fucked up encounter. This is fucked up. Holy. Holy. She's not actually right.

612
02:59:52,149 --> 03:00:18,459
Nice camera. Oh, there she is. I found her. Okay. One, two, three, go. You're scary. I'm not scary.

613
03:00:18,459 --> 03:00:30,969
I'm having fun. Not having any. I'm not. What are you, why do you call me a horror fight?

614
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:37,530
It's a, what? You didn't see anybody go. Oh, what the heck? Oh shit. I'm lost in dark souls.

615
03:00:37,530 --> 03:00:44,090
What the fuck, dude? It's scary. I'm not the only person that's done this. There are tons of us get

616
03:00:44,090 --> 03:00:49,450
very heated and very upset at these games. I don't know what you're on about because I know for a

617
03:00:49,450 --> 03:01:19,659
fact that at least there's no way I would be able to do this when I'm 40. No. Okay. Okay. Here's the

618
03:01:19,659 --> 03:01:25,020
thing, guys. Listen to me. If FromSoftware comes out with another game in like four years and I'm

619
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:29,100
still screaming, we're just going to skip that one. We're just going to skip that. I'm not going to

620
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:33,979
be able to do it when I'm 40. I don't know. This is the last time that I think I'll be able to beat

621
03:01:33,979 --> 03:01:43,670
like a fucking FromSoftware boss. When I'm 40 years old, I'm going to be like, I'm going to have to

622
03:01:43,670 --> 03:02:06,260
count when I dodge. You know what I mean? Like one, two. All right, let's go. Good luck to all of you.

623
03:02:07,059 --> 03:02:11,700
Good luck to all of you sorry motherfuckers that are going to have to play the next FromSoftware

624
03:02:11,700 --> 03:02:19,540
game and go up against Melina the maggot and deal with the harder boss they make.

625
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:31,819
It's going to be harder than this. Go luck. I'm going to be on the sidelines. I'm going to be like,

626
03:02:31,819 --> 03:02:42,469
oh shit, man, I'm glad I'm 40 and I don't have to do this. What happened? I wasn't even looking.

627
03:02:44,280 --> 03:04:00,729
Wait, did I win? They need more. No, not again. Not again. Get in there, Mambo. Come on. Come on,

628
03:04:00,729 --> 03:04:25,530
son. Come on, son. God, it's like you can't. It's so hard to see them. One does like a thrust.

629
03:04:25,530 --> 03:04:31,610
There's like three that are like one, two, three thrust. The thrust one is like it comes like from

630
03:04:31,610 --> 03:04:43,290
here. Oh, this sucks such ass. It's past your bedtime. No, it's not. This is the actual last

631
03:04:43,290 --> 03:05:11,219
try. You take too much damage, then you die. Um, no, not really. Yeah, I didn't even see it.

632
03:05:11,940 --> 03:05:47,260
Too much stuff on the screen. He's going to die for that. That sucks, man. I like need him for phase

633
03:05:47,260 --> 03:07:07,860
two. I'd rather she do that to me. Keep at it. Oh, this is bad news. Really bad. I was such a bad

634
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:18,100
spot. Oh my God. Like how, man, I was just underneath her. More roll, dude. It's just that

635
03:07:18,100 --> 03:07:24,870
move is fucking impossible to get away from. I was like right there as you just too close.

636
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:30,840
I could dodge through it, but then you go dodge through it like three or four times and not get

637
03:07:30,840 --> 03:07:55,770
hit at all. I want to beat this, but it's so un-fucking-bearable. That's un-fucking-bearable.

638
03:07:59,079 --> 03:08:09,860
No, you need the cheering and inspiration. I need the boss not to 10,000 animations

639
03:08:10,659 --> 03:08:15,799
before I get to drink out of my flask. That wasn't to you. That was a great, that was towards

640
03:08:15,799 --> 03:08:19,879
Melina. It was towards Melina. It was not towards you. I'm going to make that very clear.

641
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:34,309
That was a growl towards Melina. Very upset with her. I'm just going with my eyes closed.

642
03:08:34,309 --> 03:08:38,229
Fuck it. Who cares? This boss sucks. I'll as well try to do it without fucking looking.

643
03:09:17,270 --> 03:09:57,850
What's happening? I thought that was me that died. What happened? What? What the fuck happened?

644
03:09:58,649 --> 03:10:14,860
He was stuck in the corner. Oh, I was like, why am I alive for this long?

645
03:10:17,020 --> 03:10:24,739
Jump over that move. Write that down and put it on the wiki. I look fucking horrible.

646
03:10:25,459 --> 03:10:49,829
I need more stamina. I need, I'm going to respect him. I'm going to respect him.

647
03:10:50,870 --> 03:11:10,149
I'm just fucking around now. Get a bleed weapon. I don't want to go get the mimic tier.

648
03:11:10,149 --> 03:11:16,229
Go get a plus 10 bleed weapon. Sit in the corner. Fire arrows at her in phase one.

649
03:11:17,030 --> 03:11:21,829
Go get the summon that is like the cheese for this and just stand there and win for free.

650
03:11:22,629 --> 03:11:56,899
What the fuck happened here? Travelers close? What do I do now? You're already doing a cheese

651
03:11:56,899 --> 03:12:04,340
strat. What difference does it make if you do another cheese strat? Okay. You came in here with

652
03:12:04,979 --> 03:12:14,020
10 dex, 10 strength. Do 10 vitality, 40 endurance, and you dodged every single attack and you did

653
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:23,770
14 damage a swing. Good. I don't want to do that. I want to kill this person.

654
03:12:24,329 --> 03:12:35,690
Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania, Melania. Excuse me. Melania is who I am referring to.

655
03:12:36,329 --> 03:12:42,500
Don't fucking twist my shit around. I want to kill this person. I want to kill Melania.

656
03:12:42,579 --> 03:12:46,260
I want to kill this person as quickly and as efficiently as possible.

657
03:12:46,260 --> 03:12:53,940
That's sorceries. That's, that's lightning moves. I don't want to dodge every attack.

658
03:12:53,940 --> 03:13:02,469
I want to kill this person as fast as possible. I want Melania. I don't want to dodge every attack.

659
03:13:02,469 --> 03:13:09,690
I want to sit there and fucking annihilate. He hates Melania's. Oh, it's, you're making me very

660
03:13:09,690 --> 03:13:21,799
upset. Okay. So we're going to go. I just so badly want to just Melania needs to die

661
03:13:21,799 --> 03:13:26,680
as fast as fucking possible. I want to kill them so bad. I want to go back in there and fucking get

662
03:13:26,680 --> 03:13:31,719
what I can't. It's, it's like a Ouija board right now. Like I want to go in that room and do it,

663
03:13:32,440 --> 03:13:54,489
but I'm going to go over here instead. You keep making it. No, you know, I don't twist my words.

664
03:13:55,290 --> 03:14:26,950
To playing against millennium, these guys actually kind of feel like I, I just, let's go

665
03:14:58,069 --> 03:15:06,440
beast man's curb sword. I would, I'm gone. Like there's no way you get that close.

666
03:15:07,159 --> 03:15:36,309
But what, what is even over here? No attention. I didn't do it. Did you beat millennium? Yep.

667
03:15:38,069 --> 03:15:47,340
It actually wasn't even that bad. I it's weird. I just pressed R1 like over and I didn't even

668
03:15:47,979 --> 03:15:53,340
I just pressed R1 like this. Like I didn't even, I just staggered her a bunch of times. It's crazy.

669
03:15:54,299 --> 03:16:00,809
I think I spoke something up because it was like, eventually like,

670
03:16:06,170 --> 03:16:09,129
I think I crashed the game a little bit, but whatever. I'll take the win. I don't care.

671
03:16:09,129 --> 03:16:15,379
She was frozen, like going like that. It was pretty cool. I got like the men.

672
03:16:15,379 --> 03:16:19,459
It was so weird to watch. It was fucked up. I just walked off the edge.

673
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:35,670
Sounds like the game's fault. I'm fine. Don't worry.

674
03:16:36,709 --> 03:16:43,350
I'm fine. I knew going into that, that was going to be fucking hell. Have I been up here already?

675
03:16:43,909 --> 03:17:14,819
I am going backwards. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I remember this. And it's down here and straight ahead.

676
03:17:15,860 --> 03:17:27,780
Find grace is that one. So wait, I killed the dragon that was out here. All right. Yeah. So I

677
03:17:27,780 --> 03:18:03,579
got to go this way here. This one tempest facing balcony. Dragon over there. What the fuck is that?

678
03:18:21,670 --> 03:18:25,670
I'm going to get some water. I'll be right back. Fuck. I'm going to fucking freak out.

679
03:18:26,469 --> 03:18:30,950
I so badly want to go to that bonfire and just go in the door and kill millennia. You know what I

680
03:18:30,950 --> 03:18:37,540
mean? That's all I can think of. Except my head rent free. Just there. I see her face.

681
03:18:38,100 --> 03:23:12,950
This one. Right back. See, it's wet. Wet seat. I wish that was his joke.

682
03:23:25,020 --> 03:23:44,739
Okay. Well, that millennia was fun. This dumb ass game. I'm kidding. I like it. So I don't want this

683
03:23:44,739 --> 03:23:58,700
to be loud. I'm going to mute actually. I hate when this hurts. You know, like that, like boom,

684
03:23:58,700 --> 03:24:05,610
when you break a seal. Really loud. Just a little one. Just one of these little protocols.

685
03:24:05,610 --> 03:24:42,889
It's been fun. Are you afraid of turning a gas stove on? No, I just don't like it.

686
03:24:43,690 --> 03:24:52,500
This is where I ended up. I guess I can go down. Came from in there. I'm going to go down. I go

687
03:24:52,500 --> 03:25:01,739
over this way, I guess. Whatever this place is. I'm really, really curious if the two fingers

688
03:25:02,620 --> 03:25:25,049
have something to do with this. Just thinking about millennia. I just want to go in there and

689
03:25:25,690 --> 03:25:52,549
you know what I mean? Who's shooting at me? What is the hard cap for damage stats, by the way?

690
03:25:54,069 --> 03:26:01,340
Are you going to fight the secret boss here or are you going to let me strong do it? Let's see what

691
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:24,520
it is. I'll try whatever it is if I can do it. Cool. So what's here? Golden rune nine. That's it.

692
03:26:38,340 --> 03:26:41,620
Ninety is the only true cap. Hailing falls off at eighty.

693
03:26:42,260 --> 03:27:16,729
Somber stone. That's weird. My whole computer just hung up. How you doing? How you guys doing?

694
03:27:16,729 --> 03:27:27,020
You guys all right? You guys doing all right? How are you doing? How are things? All right?

695
03:27:27,020 --> 03:27:44,329
My tooth hurts. Oh, I'm sorry. Are all of these things tied up to the... Are they tied here?

696
03:27:47,510 --> 03:28:19,450
Yeah, they look chained to these posts. Do you press joker impression? Dude, no. No,

697
03:28:19,450 --> 03:28:47,239
thanks. Not... All right. Give me another day. Damn. You go sweeping with it, all right?

698
03:28:47,879 --> 03:29:04,340
Can you just be funny again? What do you mean again? When was I funny? Was I funny before? What

699
03:29:04,340 --> 03:29:09,299
did I do? What was the funny thing that I did today? Holy shit, this goes all the way down there.

700
03:29:09,299 --> 03:29:25,340
Oh yeah, I did say I was going to ship my pants on command. I don't know. What do you want me to say?

701
03:29:26,299 --> 03:29:39,299
She said I was upset about stuff. Remember, like, getting the nut kick bit? I don't remember that.

702
03:29:39,299 --> 03:29:43,780
I remember talking about, like, FromSoftware's... I don't remember. It was like I got kicked in the

703
03:29:43,780 --> 03:30:00,709
nuts from FromSoftware's new game. All right, this way, that way, or that way. This way.

704
03:30:02,549 --> 03:30:21,270
Cool. Raid the blind rage. No, I remember talking about it. I'm kidding.

705
03:30:21,270 --> 03:30:47,610
Oh, you are. I just have such a treat in front of you. You really are. Bloodborne?

706
03:30:48,409 --> 03:31:15,209
Never played it before? What the fuck are these eye frames? Dude, what the heck? These fucking

707
03:31:15,209 --> 03:31:47,399
halberds. The hitbox is a gigantic ice cream cone. I can't wait to investigate this. Yeah,

708
03:31:47,399 --> 03:32:33,989
it really is too bad Bloodborne's not on PC. Come on, get out here. Leave me alone. Oh, another tree.

709
03:32:45,799 --> 03:32:55,510
Oh, I'll go right. You have spells, you use them. I know. You think I don't think I know

710
03:32:55,510 --> 03:33:10,040
that I have a spell? Come on. I know. I know. I actually have too many mana blasts if I'm not

711
03:33:10,040 --> 03:33:20,680
against millennia. Oh, don't get up, right?

712
03:33:50,139 --> 03:34:10,739
Okay, I could go that way eventually. Maybe I get there from here. Oh shit.

713
03:34:22,389 --> 03:34:44,819
What are these guys? These? What are they? And not banished nights? Okay, well, it's that.

714
03:34:45,540 --> 03:35:02,170
That. What? I have to fight two of them? Gold skin duo. Oh my god, this is going to be awful.

715
03:35:06,250 --> 03:35:24,420
Doesn't that suck shit up? I don't know who I'd rather fight.

716
03:35:42,809 --> 03:36:19,909
What's the game lagging? Well, okay, they're in that room. What is the fastest way to get there?

717
03:36:23,639 --> 03:36:27,000
You got to fight. I can't move. I'm going to sneeze. That's why I want to be aware.

718
03:36:27,000 --> 03:36:30,579
I don't think there's anything I can probably do about it. I could probably do this.

719
03:36:31,540 --> 03:37:11,399
Oh, it's right here. Excuse me? Why can I go in there? What? Um, I can't go in that door.

720
03:37:13,299 --> 03:37:29,500
That's the only door that looks like that. Like, listen. Horseship. Really? Does this one work?

721
03:37:34,700 --> 03:38:27,799
Where are they? Dude, that move is so dumb. This lag is killing me here.

722
03:38:28,440 --> 03:38:44,250
All right, let me guess. You go like, get like huge.

723
03:39:03,500 --> 03:39:23,860
Huh? Really? Okay. It's kind of annoying, isn't it? This honestly doesn't feel that bad.

724
03:39:24,579 --> 03:39:56,200
I feel like I'm going to be okay. So they've resummoned each other.

725
03:39:56,200 --> 03:40:19,030
Is there someone outside the door? I wonder who it could be. I'm going to fly into outer space.

726
03:40:20,360 --> 03:40:42,280
Oh, you know, it might be Roger. Wait. No, it's not. Where am I fucking going?

727
03:40:51,049 --> 03:41:13,290
Okay, it's not there. You got to go around here. Where the fuck? Okay, honestly.

728
03:41:14,809 --> 03:41:23,350
Where? Stop swinging at me. I need to. Which way is it? Is it down this way?

729
03:41:24,069 --> 03:41:30,059
Isn't this where it just went? It's like all the way down and around, right? Yeah, down here.

730
03:41:30,059 --> 03:42:12,600
That's supposed to suck up sorceries and it doesn't. You're already doing the.

731
03:42:13,719 --> 03:42:26,600
I guess there's 50% health. Oh fuck, they're both in their second phases.

732
03:42:39,989 --> 03:42:49,399
Do it! Shit, and you're going to summon your fucking friend again.

733
03:42:50,200 --> 03:43:12,579
I have no healing potions left. What are you stupid? Why would you come in here without them?

734
03:43:12,579 --> 03:43:41,940
I'm like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. What? What's going on? Okay, are we good? Are we good? What the

735
03:43:41,940 --> 03:44:02,329
fuck happened? Backflame tornado. Cool. This boss is the worst boss in the game with the melee build.

736
03:44:02,329 --> 03:44:18,090
I think millennia probably is the worst boss in the game with any character. Very cool. All right.

737
03:44:18,090 --> 03:44:30,379
I got a bell too. What was that bell? It was not that bad. I feel like that could be awful.

738
03:44:32,649 --> 03:44:36,649
Kind of was. Especially, I don't know if it's with other people too, but this room,

739
03:44:37,770 --> 03:44:47,219
I feel like every 10 to 20 seconds lags. That makes it even worse. That's eight and nine

740
03:44:47,219 --> 03:44:53,530
smithing stones. Holy shit. Really? You can get every single weapon in the whole game up to plus

741
03:44:53,530 --> 03:44:59,610
nine. All right, that's cool. I guess I should just keep going the way that I was going before.

742
03:45:00,329 --> 03:45:08,469
Straight through here. I can go that way or this way. I think it's cool.

743
03:45:27,290 --> 03:45:47,639
Mimic is pretty stupid. Yeah, I like it. Okay. A lot of people have been telling me to use the

744
03:45:47,639 --> 03:45:55,829
mimic on millennia. No, I'm close enough. I think I could do it. I need to hunker down

745
03:45:55,829 --> 03:46:01,989
and really go for it. I probably am not going to do it tonight. I'm going to be really, really

746
03:46:01,989 --> 03:46:24,170
honest with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, you know what? Let me do this while I'm here.

747
03:46:24,969 --> 03:46:31,030
Mimic makes the game really easy. Look, if I need to do the mimic, I'll do it, but I don't think I

748
03:46:31,030 --> 03:47:02,340
have to. I don't think so. Well, it is still difficult with the mimic. I would. Yeah, I make

749
03:47:02,340 --> 03:47:07,139
the game easy. That's not the point. Oh, I mean, the point with any video game is to have fun.

750
03:47:07,139 --> 03:47:16,200
All right. That's the whole point. However, you get enjoyment out of a game you're playing. That's

751
03:47:16,200 --> 03:47:46,520
how you should do it. You have certainly learned that from Molina. That's not what I wanted to do.

752
03:47:47,239 --> 03:47:51,799
Oh my goodness. This is very sloppy. Okay. That was, I just got like trapped.

753
03:47:53,319 --> 03:48:06,250
I mean, I got literally trapped. It's one hundred and thirty FP for the black knife.

754
03:48:08,790 --> 03:48:19,620
I didn't have, do I actually have that? Barely. All right. Let's try this again. That was annoying.

755
03:48:20,579 --> 03:48:29,770
Okay. Blink. Good. You're in the lake. Are you going to the area after Loretto?

756
03:48:29,770 --> 03:48:37,770
I would rewind about an hour or two. I would rewind an hour. You're probably okay. If you

757
03:48:37,770 --> 03:48:43,940
rewind exactly one hour, I'm probably purple and screaming and talking about getting kicked in the

758
03:48:43,940 --> 03:49:12,040
balls. You have to rewind a little. Oh, that's annoying. Stop it. This glare in my eyes. I

759
03:49:12,040 --> 03:49:37,479
can't even see where you are. That's a boss door. I'm imagining I have to go around.

760
03:50:10,840 --> 03:50:19,370
Walk into range. I don't. You're not going to do this.

761
03:50:32,860 --> 03:50:46,280
You're pissing off my cat. I'm sorry. I didn't. That's not my intention.

762
03:50:49,860 --> 03:50:55,540
This place is probably, I would say the coolest part of the whole game. I think

763
03:50:55,540 --> 03:51:02,040
scenery wise and scale and how cool it looks. All the tornadoes. This place is awesome.

764
03:51:11,000 --> 03:51:41,559
Dragon's dragon. It's like a dragon place. Jack over here. All right. I can climb this. Can I?

765
03:51:42,440 --> 03:52:02,680
Oh, it's not. Wait. Oh, I did that.

766
03:52:21,450 --> 03:52:22,489
Fall off the edge. Yeah.

767
03:52:53,049 --> 03:53:01,239
I don't know how to get there. It's down here and then around. I don't know. Whatever. I gotta run.

768
03:53:04,010 --> 03:53:06,549
I don't want to lose those souls, please.

769
03:53:07,430 --> 03:54:11,750
I make too much noise. Oh, another one. Jesus.

770
03:54:15,639 --> 03:54:17,909
That's a good movie death.

771
03:54:21,659 --> 03:54:33,479
Is that all that was over here? Did I really come all the way over here for a lightning grease?

772
03:54:34,440 --> 03:55:06,649
No, right? That's a pain. Hey, I could jump to there and go that way. Let's check and see

773
03:55:06,649 --> 03:55:27,659
what's up here though and just walk. Dumbass. Nothing gonna explode. Okay, so I can jump from

774
03:55:29,450 --> 03:56:01,829
up where? Where's this? There's just another. Okay, just go this way. What's in the colosseum?

775
03:56:02,469 --> 03:56:11,319
Gonna be a dragon. It's gonna be a huge dragon. And then we're gonna get lore dumped. I kind of

776
03:56:11,319 --> 03:56:18,840
hope we get lore dumped. I want to get lore dumped. You see, tarnished in the age of dragons

777
03:56:18,840 --> 03:56:53,209
and the two fingers. I want. Give it to me. I want to get lore dumped so bad. I am hoping for like

778
03:56:53,209 --> 03:57:37,020
a five minute cutscene. Souls game? I know. It's not gonna happen. Any superheroes in chat?

779
03:57:38,629 --> 03:58:04,229
Um, I don't know. Do we have any superheroes here? Where? That's over here. Oh yeah, okay.

780
03:58:04,229 --> 03:58:29,770
Um, I'm gonna keep going down. It's gonna kill me. Wait, actually you mad scientist.

781
03:58:30,889 --> 03:58:46,889
I'm imagining I gotta go like across there? There? To the right? Is there where to go up from here?

782
03:58:46,889 --> 04:00:21,879
Oh my god, that hurts. I forgot you have to jump. Oh boy, it hurts every moment. Yeah.

783
04:00:23,079 --> 04:01:21,139
Where is he? Those guys are tricky. Is that like an axe? Is it like a dragon? Oh boy. Nice.

784
04:01:21,700 --> 04:01:34,420
All right, don't fuck this up. You need to go to bed? I will. Whatever. I want to see what this

785
04:01:34,420 --> 04:03:12,979
boss is. 122. Shit. Well, okay. You little shit. I hear another one. Missed.

786
04:03:42,629 --> 04:04:07,190
What? I feel like I can make this jump, but it's definitely a shortcut. So, um, I,

787
04:04:07,989 --> 04:04:27,909
I guess we're gonna run. Run? I'm gonna die. Is there safety over here? No.

788
04:04:35,700 --> 04:04:43,049
It shows up on the ground for like a second and then it goes away.

789
04:04:59,350 --> 04:05:53,750
Oh shit, this bird's all over me. Can I get on my horse? Oh Jesus.

790
04:06:03,430 --> 04:06:13,500
You're not gonna kill him? Dude, I need to be safe for a second here.

791
04:06:13,500 --> 04:06:26,200
I'm not gonna fight the guy with five eagles surrounding me. Where is he? Where does he go?

792
04:06:26,200 --> 04:07:09,180
He leaves. He left. You're gonna be a pain in the ass. I know you are. Okay, so he's gone.

793
04:07:10,059 --> 04:07:42,889
I'm back. I don't, I don't know. He's not here. Okay, I'm just gonna keep going. He's gonna jump

794
04:07:42,889 --> 04:08:11,299
on your head. All right, let's walk through this. We're getting really close to the tornado.

795
04:08:11,940 --> 04:08:32,700
I'm almost at it, man. I missed the item behind the dragon. I did? Oh shit, there is an item.

796
04:08:32,700 --> 04:08:48,120
Have you seen a tornado in real life? I have not. I'm equally terrified and fascinated.

797
04:08:49,000 --> 04:09:06,819
Thank you. Yeah, I'm equally horrified and fascinated by tornado. So what's up here?

798
04:09:06,819 --> 04:09:53,399
I'm gonna two-hand this now. I feel like I have 30 smithing stone sevens. Is there a guy going?

799
04:09:53,399 --> 04:10:00,760
What are you doing? What are you, why are you getting into position?

800
04:10:15,700 --> 04:11:17,610
Oh, why is he standing there like that? Get up, stand up. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

801
04:11:18,889 --> 04:11:51,590
Fool me. Why am I going back to this thing? That's it, right? Just you two. There's another one in

802
04:11:51,590 --> 04:12:18,170
here. Yes, there is. You sneaky little shit. Another bell bearing. I don't get the grace.

803
04:12:19,049 --> 04:12:39,260
What? What's going on? What? Grace up at the lift. Yeah, I mean, I'm just, I'm just going, man.

804
04:12:52,280 --> 04:13:14,360
I'm going. I'm right here. I don't want to die. I'll go back after the grace. Let me level up.

805
04:13:17,879 --> 04:13:26,979
All right, it's time to start putting points in endurance, I think. Or should I get to 60

806
04:13:26,979 --> 04:13:45,989
bigger? I think it's endurance. That's so low. Okay, so I'm here. Are you saying that there is a,

807
04:13:47,979 --> 04:13:57,959
oh, back here, there's a secret area. Somebody said, shut up, chat, get a hobby.

808
04:14:01,879 --> 04:14:31,670
Get a hobby. Um, this dragon has no health. Can I get there quickly from somewhere? I've even been

809
04:14:31,670 --> 04:14:43,819
down there. Yeah, right. Isn't that the guy that was throwing lightning at me? Yeah, it is. It's

810
04:14:43,819 --> 04:15:04,139
on here. Use your hat as a glider. Just go down the stairs. Yeah, I guess I could just run. It

811
04:15:04,139 --> 04:15:34,139
could have been a lot more nerve wracking. I feel like it may have been. Stop already. Stop. Okay,

812
04:15:34,139 --> 04:15:39,819
so this dragon has no health. I was, yeah, I've got a feeling you're gonna be a brilliant

813
04:15:39,819 --> 04:16:10,809
ass, aren't you? Um, let's go. Why does he, his health is so low. Okay, that was cool.

814
04:16:11,610 --> 04:16:21,579
Why was his health so low? That's not what we were talking about. By the trees where the guy got into

815
04:16:21,579 --> 04:16:50,340
position. What, over here? You mean down here? By the trees where the guy got in position over here.

816
04:16:51,059 --> 04:17:24,870
Am I gonna die if I do that? I feel like I'm gonna die. Am I dead by these? Dead? Okay, well,

817
04:17:24,870 --> 04:17:29,430
I, I thought it was there. Press the button, at least it's gonna be there when I get back.

818
04:17:30,309 --> 04:18:07,030
Okay, so we're at, oh, around still? I'm there. Right up through a path to see guys and look down

819
04:18:07,030 --> 04:18:22,500
to the right. Fucking leave me alone. Is it, it's right here, isn't it? What's that? That's not it.

820
04:18:23,139 --> 04:18:30,409
Why did he jump? I was already gone. I mean, if I, I went into the tornado, you don't have to come

821
04:18:30,409 --> 04:18:45,739
follow me. Straight out and then look down. It's so funny whenever they see that. They're, the AI

822
04:18:45,739 --> 04:18:53,700
in From Software games is so funny. And the reason why they're so interesting and the reason why

823
04:18:53,700 --> 04:19:00,250
these games are so fun, it's because the AI in these games has one thing that it does. It is one

824
04:19:00,250 --> 04:19:06,809
task. There's no dialogue. There's no, oh, stranger! Get him! No, no, no. Their AI is just

825
04:19:07,450 --> 04:19:13,209
fucking kill that as fast as possible, no matter what, under any circumstance. They don't do

826
04:19:13,209 --> 04:19:22,280
anything else. They just kill as much and as fast as possible. They'll even hit each other. They'll

827
04:19:22,280 --> 04:19:27,030
kill each other. They don't even care. I think that makes them even more terrifying. So many games

828
04:19:27,989 --> 04:19:36,309
do the AI where it's like, they'll talk to you. They'll stop. They'll pause for a second.

829
04:19:37,209 --> 04:19:41,129
They'll have something to say. They'll have something that they do. They'll fall down. They'll

830
04:19:41,129 --> 04:19:49,500
drop something. It's just one thing is programmed into these enemies. Kill! It's so funny when they

831
04:19:49,500 --> 04:19:55,420
both have the kill program. And when you have like two or three enemies that have the kill program,

832
04:19:55,420 --> 04:20:05,110
and they just start beating the absolute shit out of each other. And they just start beating

833
04:20:05,110 --> 04:20:12,569
the absolute shit out of each other. It's so funny. That makes them so much more terrifying.

834
04:20:12,569 --> 04:20:17,510
Especially the knights. Especially the characters that you would expect to be able to talk to you

835
04:20:17,510 --> 04:20:30,600
or say something or act any differently. No. Nothing. No talking. No expressions. They're

836
04:20:30,600 --> 04:20:46,340
just trying to kill you as hard as possible. Now, Bloodborne enemies did talk, but I don't think it

837
04:20:46,340 --> 04:21:07,290
took away from the experience. You know, like, away! Away! Oh, you foul beast! You're on the

838
04:21:07,290 --> 04:21:47,350
right way. You are no one in here! And they did like the huge scream. What do I do? You have to

839
04:21:47,350 --> 04:23:32,059
jump off it. Just lie down. Look. Look. I don't get it. Dirt patch? What? Backwards? Hey.

840
04:23:55,799 --> 04:24:40,360
Finger. No horse allowed. Interesting. This is a huge area. No horse. I mean, you're coming with

841
04:24:40,360 --> 04:24:50,250
me. Melania was fucking messed up, man. It was so hard. I think we got this one together. You and

842
04:24:50,250 --> 04:25:03,829
me? Yeah, you and me. That's a bad voice for that character. Dragon Lord Placidusax. That

843
04:25:03,829 --> 04:25:33,879
lightning. Placidusax. I'm just trying to keep my eye on the ground. Nice. Right down? Does it come

844
04:25:33,879 --> 04:25:58,969
up? What happens? That is quite the move. Gotta be aware of that. It's got like two heads. Whoa!

845
04:25:59,930 --> 04:26:47,500
Don't get greedy. Don't get greedy. There's no reason. That fills his whole body. Oh my god!

846
04:26:51,079 --> 04:26:56,680
What the fuck? Oh, it's like that bug boss. It disappears and it's scary.

847
04:27:02,700 --> 04:28:01,959
I wonder if there's a place where you don't get hurt in that. Oh my god! No! I'm terrified.

848
04:28:05,879 --> 04:28:28,489
What is he? Oh my god, that was fucking majestic. Out of time? Kind of. Oh my god.

849
04:28:29,209 --> 04:29:01,450
Almost out of mana. Let's go get ugly. Do it again.

850
04:29:24,620 --> 04:29:44,139
That was crazy. I thought he was done with the attack. One, two, three, four, five, six. One,

851
04:29:44,139 --> 04:29:50,409
two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight. Searching around in your fucking

852
04:29:50,409 --> 04:30:03,819
huge ass backpack. Why did I do that? Because I had no health. Oh my. Ouch. Because I had like

853
04:30:03,819 --> 04:30:19,100
this much health and I didn't want to die in one hit. These. I get it. That was fun. That was a

854
04:30:19,100 --> 04:30:28,420
cool fight. What else do I want to put on here? I'll take, let's take, I'll take a rune arc.

855
04:30:28,420 --> 04:31:33,850
Let's take it down there. Go the fuck back up. Does he hate the game? What? No. I think it's

856
04:31:33,850 --> 04:31:48,250
amazing. Where's the nurse here? That fight's really cool. I'm looking forward to doing it again.

857
04:31:48,969 --> 04:31:52,299
I wish there was a statue down here. I don't have to do this every single time.

858
04:31:52,860 --> 04:32:21,180
Let's take a rune arc. Why not? Yeah, why not? Let's go. And let's go.

859
04:32:21,979 --> 04:32:28,700
Elden Ring is objectively a mediocre game. I'm gonna have to disagree with you a little.

860
04:32:29,500 --> 04:32:45,770
I'm not going for, I'm not doing any moon shit. No moons. That's way too fancy right now. Just

861
04:32:45,770 --> 04:33:15,340
kill it. Oh fuck. My fingers are getting like really sore and slippery. That's a sign. That's

862
04:33:15,340 --> 04:33:43,110
a bad sign. How do you do that? The edge. You know what? Oh my god. What am I thinking?

863
04:33:44,580 --> 04:34:03,939
That's a perfect time to do this a couple times. There he goes. He's gonna do this bullshit. Yep.

864
04:34:04,819 --> 04:34:29,240
Oh, he does a little, a little hop. He does this little like, oh shit, this is bad. He does like a

865
04:34:29,240 --> 04:34:47,369
little shit. Fuck out of this. This is a really awful sloppy fucking run. This is the worst run

866
04:34:47,369 --> 04:34:54,939
I've done all night on any bus. It happens when you play for eight and a half hours.

867
04:34:55,740 --> 04:36:00,860
That's the watch. I'm gonna have to leave it. Unless I can fucking take this. Oh, come on. Oh

868
04:36:00,860 --> 04:36:57,099
my god. Miss stamina. Where is he? Oh my god, he's behind me. Moon. I did like five moons to him.

869
04:36:57,099 --> 04:37:08,459
You gotta rush him. That was the last bit's rough. I was really, really sloppy on the first phase

870
04:37:08,459 --> 04:37:36,900
there. I was just like jump, jump, jump, jump, jump. That was awful. Nebula will be really good.

871
04:37:36,900 --> 04:38:00,919
Actually, that's a really good idea. I'll try Nebula. Moon isn't good to spam. Use it once

872
04:38:00,919 --> 04:38:08,220
with the debuff. Does the moon make anybody take more magic damage or is it only cold

873
04:38:08,220 --> 04:38:28,340
sorcery damage? The only frost. I'm gonna do, let's just go in there and just, just Nebula.

874
04:38:28,340 --> 04:38:31,220
Let's do Nebula. Let's just get in there. Just get, let's get in there. Watch this.

875
04:38:31,939 --> 04:38:40,119
I'm just gonna get in there and Nebula. Let's get in there. Yeah, it's Nebula time. Fucking,

876
04:38:40,119 --> 04:38:50,680
let's go. You wanna cast this for free? Probably could have got a little closer,

877
04:38:50,680 --> 04:38:58,569
but whatever. Nebula, let's go. Nebula. I'm not, I don't even care about these souls.

878
04:38:59,290 --> 04:39:22,659
Check this out. All right, the first part of this fight, he just puts that shit everywhere.

879
04:39:22,659 --> 04:39:41,580
And this is what happened to me last time. I can't tell if it's better. It's hard to tell.

880
04:39:42,380 --> 04:40:03,979
Am I doing more damage? I think it takes a little longer. I don't think so. Cold is better. He's

881
04:40:03,979 --> 04:40:08,540
gonna do that move where he spams the ground with that bullshit. Where is it? Come on, just do it.

882
04:40:08,540 --> 04:40:32,229
I know you can do it. All right, the one fucking second that I... Stop it! Oh my god, he scared

883
04:40:32,229 --> 04:41:03,900
the fuck out of me, dude. Can you fucking stop doing that? Dude, stop. Stay. Why is he not staying?

884
04:41:04,700 --> 04:41:54,549
Am I still in it? God damn it. Oh my god. I'm dead. Why is it always fucking right on me?

885
04:41:54,549 --> 04:42:01,290
You have to be, it's right on me every goddamn time. I don't know what these assholes are like.

886
04:42:01,290 --> 04:42:04,250
If you get closer, you just have to fucking, you just have to run. Just run away from the fight.

887
04:42:05,209 --> 04:42:12,279
Don't get close to him. Don't stay far away. Don't get close to him. Don't get far away. Don't get

888
04:42:12,279 --> 04:42:58,580
close to him. Are you stupid? God damn it. Where is he? You? What the fuck do I do about that move?

889
04:42:59,700 --> 04:43:30,470
Fucking Jesus. What are you doing, man? You done? I can't get him down at this part.

890
04:43:30,470 --> 04:43:33,349
They had to put another one of these assholes in the game that just like

891
04:43:33,349 --> 04:43:39,700
fucking appears behind you somewhere. So when he starts doing that move, he's gonna run out.

892
04:43:44,340 --> 04:43:52,020
Okay, the actual first thing is first. Do not, under any fucking circumstance,

893
04:43:52,020 --> 04:43:58,419
do not go near the boss in the first minute. He just puts the red stuff on the ground and

894
04:43:58,419 --> 04:44:02,099
you're gonna get hit by it and you're gonna drink four flasks because you get stuck in there. Do

895
04:44:02,099 --> 04:44:22,659
you understand? So you're literally just bad. You're literally getting banned for five days.

896
04:44:25,240 --> 04:44:41,659
Got him. I'm probably streaming five days. By the way, five days is about five minutes.

897
04:44:51,779 --> 04:44:58,540
They brought this gimmick back. It's just like the boss disappears and you fucking

898
04:44:59,259 --> 04:45:30,889
found him. I'm not gonna take a rune arc. I don't think it's a waste. See? He does this stupid shit

899
04:45:30,889 --> 04:45:38,680
and I keep getting hit by it. I'm not getting hit by it anymore. Check it out. It's the same two

900
04:45:38,680 --> 04:45:44,099
stupid ass fucking moves in the beginning. Just wait till this asshole is done with his stupid

901
04:45:44,900 --> 04:46:29,459
spam the whole fucking room and now let's play the game. He's ass kicked.

902
04:46:30,180 --> 04:46:51,159
Ambo's getting destroyed. He's trying to run away. He's like, oh shit, am I too far away? What?

903
04:46:52,470 --> 04:48:36,759
No, I'm not. Okay, here we go. Fuck you. Done? No! Jesus! Oh, that little fucking crowhop is so

904
04:48:36,759 --> 04:49:30,840
stupid. Fuck you. Where is he? Oh shit. Dude, come on. What the fuck? Oh, you pain in the ass.

905
04:49:31,560 --> 04:50:06,090
I already knew. Dude, where? Where? No, that was quick. That was quick, bro. That was quick.

906
04:50:06,970 --> 04:50:29,990
Bro, that was quick. You built a pain in the ass. I don't know. I think that was fun. Remembrance of

907
04:50:29,990 --> 04:50:46,569
the Dragon Lord. That's a lot. Mogs was the most in the whole game so far.

908
04:50:48,169 --> 04:50:58,380
Mogs was 420,000. I mean, that was a really cool fight. It was. You know, the teleport shit.

909
04:51:00,919 --> 04:51:04,759
That was probably one of the cooler fights in the game. Just in regards to bosses.

910
04:51:06,549 --> 04:51:12,779
Interesting that was. So this is... I have so many fucking items in my inventory.

911
04:51:12,779 --> 04:51:28,919
Where is it? Is that just a spell? Isn't it a remembrance? Where is it?

912
04:51:32,310 --> 04:51:39,060
Oh, it's a weird looking. Remembrance of Dragon Lord Placidusax. He went into the urd tree.

913
04:51:40,099 --> 04:51:44,919
Hour of its namesake can be unlocked by the finger reader. Yeah. Dragon Lord whose seat lies at the

914
04:51:44,919 --> 04:51:51,479
heart of the storm beyond time. Said to have been Elden Lord in the age before the urd tree.

915
04:51:52,439 --> 04:52:00,310
Once his god was fled, the lord continued to await its return. This dragon was the Elden Lord?

916
04:52:03,450 --> 04:52:24,259
The original Elden Lord. That's pretty cool. 25 endurance is probably what I'm going for here.

917
04:52:25,860 --> 04:52:38,970
Anybody have anything to say about that? Anybody have anything to say?

918
04:52:40,759 --> 04:52:44,250
You're still gone. But what's up? What is it? What's the item?

919
04:52:54,979 --> 04:53:10,229
Dragon King's Crag Blade and 36 faith. Golden Breath of the Dragon Lord.

920
04:53:11,740 --> 04:53:14,619
It storms the caster into the dragon lord to spew golden breath.

921
04:53:15,419 --> 04:53:19,400
These are the dying whales of the dragon lord who once dwelled eternally beyond time.

922
04:53:22,819 --> 04:53:36,840
Seems pretty good. These are both awesome. This is just a pure dex weapon. That's pretty cool.

923
04:53:37,400 --> 04:53:48,779
How much longer? I'm gonna see what the boss is up there and then I'll probably end it there.

924
04:53:48,779 --> 04:53:56,700
I don't think we're gonna beat it. Well, I'm gonna break it. I'm gonna smash it.

925
04:53:57,259 --> 04:54:06,409
Because I thought that's not for this character. Oh yeah, Holly is doing dragon stuff. So

926
04:54:07,290 --> 04:54:17,990
when you get that, it's gonna be cool. Next boss is one of the best in the game.

927
04:54:19,509 --> 04:54:25,700
I think that one was pretty cool. I would put that up there. 30,000 souls is really nothing.

928
04:54:31,099 --> 04:54:37,639
I want to keep going over there. This area I think is my favorite area of the game.

929
04:54:38,439 --> 04:54:48,459
I think it's just really really cool looking. This place is beyond time. What this place is?

930
04:54:49,020 --> 04:55:08,869
I don't get it. Yes it is. The right place. Everything went backwards. Not right either.

931
04:55:08,869 --> 04:55:15,029
Which is the? This is where I fought him. Dragon Temple. What's the right one?

932
04:55:18,599 --> 04:55:33,500
By the bridge bud. There we go. Okay. So this thing like is rewinding time.

933
04:55:36,250 --> 04:55:39,049
Or it did when I lay down. Why did it do that when I lay down?

934
04:55:41,639 --> 04:55:59,939
Go down there. Storm at the center is beyond time. Well, no time like the present.

935
04:56:00,659 --> 04:56:28,549
Free sentinel? It is. You're like a waffle tree sentinel. You're different than the others.

936
04:56:29,270 --> 04:58:10,790
One of these guys. Eat that and I will die if I didn't. You gotta be fucking kidding me.

937
04:58:30,549 --> 04:58:43,380
Whoa. Malformed dragon helm. Malformed dragon armor. Let me take a look at that.

938
04:58:44,340 --> 04:58:52,549
Holy shit. It's not even that heavy. Malformed golden armor adorned with various dragon imagery

939
04:58:52,549 --> 04:58:59,750
formed by the misshapen tree sentinels. After the great ancient dragon Bransax attacked,

940
04:58:59,750 --> 04:59:04,869
the sentinels had an epiphany. The only way to truly protect the urtri was to become dragons

941
04:59:04,869 --> 04:59:22,979
themselves. Is that better than what I have on? Kind of is. Still medium. Still medium. Yeah.

942
04:59:26,819 --> 04:59:37,419
Yeah. Oh wow. Cool. I look pretty cool. I don't want to lose a hundred thousand souls so

943
04:59:38,139 --> 04:59:50,060
we're gonna I'm just gonna go this way for a minute. There's another way to go over here.

944
04:59:50,860 --> 05:00:07,770
I need like another twenty thousand. Is there anything else that I missed?

945
05:00:08,330 --> 05:00:15,049
Probably. But that dragon wasn't even the boss. Like the actual boss of this area.

946
05:00:15,849 --> 05:00:28,979
Is there anybody can just fight right here? Oh my god. Thank god I jumped. I just I just need to

947
05:00:28,979 --> 05:01:24,500
kill a few. Seven. I got a better idea. Stop looking. Stop looking at it. Like it's a broken

948
05:01:24,500 --> 05:01:36,119
toy. Watch out. It's so funny. They go like. I don't understand. Like why is it so confusing?

949
05:01:36,759 --> 05:02:19,700
What's there? 130? 120? We'll do endurance again. 128. Almost there. 25. 27.

950
05:02:22,180 --> 05:02:58,229
We're good. Bye. The base of the tree before millennia is a better spot. Get auto to fight

951
05:02:58,229 --> 05:03:14,439
millennia. Game crash. Please don't tell me you crashed. I think it did. Did I go too fast?

952
05:03:14,439 --> 05:03:37,000
Was I going too fast? Hope it's still there. You went too furious. I think I'm fine.

953
05:03:39,259 --> 05:03:45,799
I just want to see what's in there and then that'll be it. Bricked. I didn't. I don't think I bricked

954
05:03:45,799 --> 05:04:07,130
the save. Get some rest. Yeah I'll be fine. I'll be all right. It's definitely fine. When will you

955
05:04:07,130 --> 05:04:13,779
play something else? When I'm done with this. Which I'm getting painfully close to the end of

956
05:04:13,779 --> 05:04:35,049
the game. Painfully. See? All right. Just time. Let's do it slowly. I'm not going to do it. Okay.

957
05:04:35,049 --> 05:05:01,450
Ready? Endurance up. Now let's see what is behind this door. Very curious at what's up here because

958
05:05:02,250 --> 05:05:11,080
this area is already sort of interesting. I want to know what is in here. Who's behind this whole

959
05:05:11,080 --> 05:05:19,590
thing? Why? And what are the fingers? Why are they here? Why won't it talk to me anymore?

960
05:05:19,590 --> 05:05:39,979
Don't answer that. All right. So what is here? Oh that's a loading screen. Wait.

961
05:05:45,930 --> 05:06:13,020
It's him? What is he doing here? That's um Garanc right? I don't know what Garanc is doing here.

962
05:06:13,580 --> 05:06:24,119
He's a different guy. Didn't finish the quest line. No I didn't. A different beast clergyman.

963
05:06:24,759 --> 05:06:47,340
All right. Well okay don't roll to the left. Noted. I can't believe it. I didn't. I don't know.

964
05:06:48,060 --> 05:07:22,569
I said it and immediately forgot it. You will not take destined death from me. All right dick.

965
05:07:23,290 --> 05:08:14,490
Okay get away from the left. He's throwing rocks fast. Gotta wait a little longer for that one.

966
05:08:14,490 --> 05:08:59,000
Geez man. Jump. What did you do? Like fuck you. I'm just gonna do this.

967
05:09:11,779 --> 05:09:13,819
Don't see the fucking stupid.

968
05:09:16,060 --> 05:09:51,500
Guess who? Who's around this hand?

969
05:10:05,849 --> 05:10:30,619
We're gonna see what they look like. Oh he's one of those like wolf lion people.

970
05:10:46,970 --> 05:10:55,259
That weapon is insane. Maleketh the black blade.

971
05:11:23,560 --> 05:12:02,650
You have a debuff? I'll just set up the bonfire. Next. The ability is bleeding you.

972
05:12:08,220 --> 05:12:13,779
That's a cool fight. Low health but high damage. You just kind of gotta get in there huh?

973
05:12:13,779 --> 05:12:30,919
I wonder if I should just go to town. Reduces your max HP. All right well let's go. Just

974
05:12:30,919 --> 05:12:52,360
don't get hit. This is terrible. I can't dodge. I'm fucked. Yeah I'm dead. Just go. Like dude

975
05:12:52,360 --> 05:13:54,470
what was I thinking? He comes in so fast. Thank you game. Good luck. All right let's go.

976
05:13:56,069 --> 05:14:19,500
That's not gonna work here. Up. Down. Jesus. Okay goes up and then down and then up and then down

977
05:14:19,500 --> 05:14:32,040
and just like that. All right put the put the fucking stupid moon blade away. This is just

978
05:14:32,040 --> 05:14:36,069
gonna get me killed. This is the reason I don't even want it on the bar. Let's get rid of it.

979
05:14:36,790 --> 05:14:42,900
These are gonna get me killed. I need to think what else what do I have that's quick?

980
05:14:50,819 --> 05:15:08,939
Comet? No. I don't know. Magic glint blade. I don't think any of these are gonna do anything for me.

981
05:15:10,060 --> 05:15:23,099
I think I have to try this. This might be interesting. All right just in case. I'll

982
05:15:23,099 --> 05:15:33,959
I'll keep the moon. Yeah let me try this. I wonder how this works. Five more minutes and then I'm

983
05:15:33,959 --> 05:15:42,549
gonna go. I did not anticipate this being a nine hours rune. Bounding rain of stars is not quick.

984
05:15:42,549 --> 05:15:54,889
I'm curious if I can get it off before he comes over. Baby rattle is an accessory at this point.

985
05:15:54,889 --> 05:16:13,880
I mean at this point I have the plus 10 wooden sorcery thing. I feel like if you got hit by that

986
05:16:13,880 --> 05:16:35,110
it'd be way better. Did you do it to the pillar or bro? I'm curious if it'll not. It's okay.

987
05:16:35,669 --> 05:18:03,639
I wouldn't say it's great. Jesus christ. Oh my god. What the fuck was that shit?

988
05:18:09,900 --> 05:18:29,290
We have two minutes left. Now also like the only thing from software at this point you just have

989
05:18:29,290 --> 05:18:38,500
like a line in the middle of the health bar. Like the like phase two. Here comes phase two.

990
05:18:38,500 --> 05:19:12,220
Just put a line in the middle. We know it's there. We know it's there. Like I don't know how many

991
05:19:12,220 --> 05:19:38,630
more like hey look Jebaites. That counts. Ah fine. If that motherfucker goes down and starts talking

992
05:19:38,630 --> 05:19:43,909
and being like death is mine. I am going to keep spamming spells at him. I'm not going to let him

993
05:19:44,150 --> 05:19:49,369
keep talking. I'm going to go up there and whack him in the fucking head over and over again.

994
05:19:49,369 --> 05:21:07,669
Why would I let him talk? Shit. What's going on? Why is he stuck?

995
05:21:18,139 --> 05:21:59,750
God damn it. What the fuck? What? I couldn't do anything. I couldn't attack him.

996
05:22:00,549 --> 05:22:09,189
He was just never ending. Never fucking ending. Oh my god that's so frustrating.

997
05:22:14,389 --> 05:22:17,110
I was cringe ass guy behind the pillar.

998
05:22:30,759 --> 05:22:41,799
Oh that's so fucking frustrating. I know attack him but like dude when the guy is like just spinning

999
05:22:41,799 --> 05:22:48,759
and fucking flipping and like like fucking fanning these blood. I've only seen it two times.

1000
05:22:54,619 --> 05:23:03,139
Fucker. He was dead. This is literally the fucking second time I've seen that move.

1001
05:23:03,939 --> 05:24:48,619
Why is that not hitting me? Gotta be ready for phase two. Oh my god you motherfucker. Is it going

1002
05:24:48,619 --> 05:25:36,520
through his fucking stupid ass fucking cloak? God. I gotta stay right as they're on his legs or

1003
05:25:36,520 --> 05:25:52,869
something. Uh he almost fucking had it too. What a piece of shit. What a piece of shit. I just like

1004
05:25:52,869 --> 05:25:56,630
that time when he had like one hit left he was just like dude I didn't know if he was in what he was

1005
05:25:56,630 --> 05:27:23,610
gonna fucking do. This guy flips around like a fucking maniac. Okay he blocks it right. What does

1006
05:27:23,610 --> 05:28:23,590
he do here? Stop dodging! The input happened and I didn't do it. This game sucks. There's a cut scene?

1007
05:28:23,590 --> 05:28:29,590
What is it? I'm kidding this is one of the best games to come out in the last decade. I'm kidding.

1008
05:28:35,060 --> 05:28:39,369
Is this the third phase? No I got the resemblance. What words am I saying?

1009
05:29:08,860 --> 05:29:26,020
The rune of death is unbound and the lands between us shrouded by death's dark fate.

1010
05:29:30,069 --> 05:29:53,130
Flames will also burn the impenetrable thorns. Farewell it is then. You'll be elden lord yet.

1011
05:29:54,009 --> 05:30:09,340
What did you do? Um I burnt the whole world to the ground. He looks depressed. I'm just tired.

1012
05:30:09,979 --> 05:30:37,189
I'm just tired man. I'm cranky and I'm hungry and I'm tired and I'm stupid. What happened here?

1013
05:30:45,139 --> 05:31:28,310
Lindel Ashen capital. Whoa oh can I still go to the round table? New items can be purchased

1014
05:31:28,310 --> 05:31:51,860
from the twin maidens. This place is in the urn tree. Will you wake up already? This is a

1015
05:31:51,860 --> 05:31:59,740
fate sword. Alaketh's black blade which once harbored the power of the rune of death with a

1016
05:31:59,740 --> 05:32:04,540
sad shadow of its former glory. After a fragment of death was stolen on that fateful night,

1017
05:32:05,259 --> 05:32:10,380
Alaketh found the blade within his own flesh such that none might ever rob death again.

1018
05:32:12,229 --> 05:32:16,229
Set free the remnants of death and death plunging the greatsword into the ground to summon a

1019
05:32:16,229 --> 05:32:25,590
myriad of blades. In addition to dealing immediate damage, this attack reduces the enemy's maximum

1020
05:32:25,590 --> 05:32:39,270
HP. What about this? Man faith gets all the cool shit at the end of the game. Black blade spinning

1021
05:32:39,270 --> 05:32:46,060
slash that emits a wave of light. 46. It creates an illusory black blade then leaps forward to

1022
05:32:46,060 --> 05:32:51,110
deliver a spinning slash that emits a new wave of light, followed with one additional attack.

1023
05:32:51,750 --> 05:32:56,180
This blade was once imbued with destined death. In addition to dealing damage,

1024
05:32:56,180 --> 05:33:08,650
it reduces its foes max HP. Remembrance of the black blade. You didn't get the coolest int spell?

1025
05:33:09,369 --> 05:33:18,779
So wait, why are the two fingers still doing this? Where's the guidance? Where's the help?

1026
05:33:22,419 --> 05:33:31,880
Alaketh's helm. Queen Merica's loyal half-brother wore a blade imbued with destined death,

1027
05:33:32,520 --> 05:33:37,880
and there was not one demigod who did not fear him. Champions knew what was at stake. Indeed,

1028
05:33:37,880 --> 05:33:46,099
that is what made them champions. So let me get this straight. Is this guy who's got destined

1029
05:33:46,099 --> 05:33:58,599
death that people are afraid of? You can't come back or something? Like if Malaketh killed you,

1030
05:34:01,880 --> 05:34:06,360
were you like dead permanently or something? I don't get it. Destined death. You die for real.

1031
05:34:07,159 --> 05:34:19,430
Everyone's immortal. But if this guy killed you, you're dead. You don't come back. How much better

1032
05:34:19,430 --> 05:34:31,029
is this? It's all right. Very cool. I'm going to crush it because I am a sorcery person.

1033
05:34:37,700 --> 05:34:55,580
Who's left here? I see. You're here for some spirit too. Really? You're still here?

1034
05:34:57,580 --> 05:35:13,659
Who are you? I must be a blacksmith. Now, let's get smithing. Who are you? Tell me about yourself.

1035
05:35:14,220 --> 05:35:19,689
Could you tell me what happened? Why is the round table burning?

1036
05:35:20,810 --> 05:35:35,580
Why does that girl wait for me? What happened? Have I forgotten something of dire and bones?

1037
05:35:38,250 --> 05:36:03,000
Who are you? What does Gideon say now? Is he still just here? Or did he leave?

1038
05:36:03,560 --> 05:36:35,159
Remember that. I got a lot of these bell bearings. That's crazy. Cracked crystal.

1039
05:36:35,159 --> 05:36:54,299
What else is new here? Ease. Protection. Divine fortification. Amp. Talk to the girl again.

1040
05:37:02,939 --> 05:37:06,520
I don't know why he's making me laugh, but when I said this game sucks, somebody just went,

1041
05:37:06,520 --> 05:37:15,209
no it doesn't. It just hit me right now. That's funny. I see. Okay. Yeah. What happened to Hugh?

1042
05:37:15,770 --> 05:37:21,779
It wasn't just me this happened to. I think he'd forget who you were as well.

1043
05:37:22,419 --> 05:37:29,220
I knew he'd burn himself out. Old Hugh. I think we could talk him into leaving the round table

1044
05:37:29,220 --> 05:37:38,630
a hold now. Maybe it's better that we don't. It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay.

1045
05:37:38,630 --> 05:37:47,020
Why is- what's wrong? With Hugh. He made me who I am today. I'd like to return the kindness.

1046
05:37:48,299 --> 05:37:59,110
Whatever small way I can. Please become the elder lord. He was always saying that you were a lord

1047
05:38:00,009 --> 05:38:11,319
to him. So slay her with the weapons he smithed. Slay the god who cursed us all.

1048
05:38:11,880 --> 05:38:34,330
Well I thought that America was- Queen America was the- I mean curse. Is America evil? Okay.

1049
05:38:35,619 --> 05:38:44,360
I- I'm curious. I'm not going to bed yet. I'm curious. I just- I'm just- I want to know. I want

1050
05:38:44,360 --> 05:38:48,439
to know. I'm not going to bed. Not yet. I'm not going to fight any bosses. I just want to see

1051
05:38:48,439 --> 05:38:55,979
what's going on. I want to see something. See. I'm not doing anything. I'm not going to end the game.

1052
05:38:55,979 --> 05:39:00,869
I just want to see. Because I'm not sitting at a cliffhanger until I stream next.

1053
05:39:01,430 --> 05:39:08,470
Go talk to Hugh. You know, where- this is- look if I walk in the door and I get killed by the

1054
05:39:08,470 --> 05:39:26,119
boss- I'm not going to fight the boss, right? I just need to see. All right, let's go. It is

1055
05:39:26,119 --> 05:39:44,150
capital bash. Well I'm- now we're going to the urn tree. That's the destination, right?

1056
05:39:51,240 --> 05:39:56,840
Behold the urn tree yet stands. All in unwavering mindless of the scourge of the flame of ruin.

1057
05:39:57,939 --> 05:40:14,150
Ha ha ha. And we are yet golden ones. I'm gonna laugh my ass off if Margit shows up

1058
05:40:15,029 --> 05:40:32,790
like a fourth time. So this is the capital. It's- this is all ash. Huh. This is depressing.

1059
05:40:35,369 --> 05:40:57,700
I wonder if there's even any enemies here. This feels like it's just kind of a

1060
05:40:57,700 --> 05:41:22,659
solemn walk up to the urn tree. Okay. Well that's probably- is that an elevator?

1061
05:41:22,659 --> 05:42:13,349
Okay. Anything else I can do over here? What does your belly button look like?

1062
05:42:14,540 --> 05:42:31,720
Um, it's like the size of, uh, like a half dollar. It's like this big around. I can actually put like

1063
05:42:31,720 --> 05:42:49,259
stuff in it. If I have like change and stuff that can go in there. Okay, let's just like,

1064
05:42:49,259 --> 05:43:14,970
go I guess. You know the grace that I can go to? Our capital is burning. Okay, here we go.

1065
05:43:15,610 --> 05:43:41,880
We're in the- I knew you'd come. To stand before the Elden Ring. To become held. What a sad state of

1066
05:43:41,880 --> 05:43:48,500
affairs. I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne. I told you he was a fucking

1067
05:43:48,500 --> 05:43:56,180
asshole. Queen Micah's high hopes for us. But we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. To get Ian

1068
05:43:56,180 --> 05:44:03,990
off near the all-knowing. He does- okay, so why did he tell me to do this then? What's your fucking

1069
05:44:03,990 --> 05:44:26,520
problem? Oh, you're a real fucking chump, that's for sure. Unless let me go, let me guess. He's

1070
05:44:26,520 --> 05:44:48,180
got a face to it. Not actually. Shit. Okay, I'm gonna kill this guy right now. I just- I didn't

1071
05:44:48,180 --> 05:44:56,860
know what he did. He's- does he have a rune? You actually died? He actually died, to get Ian.

1072
05:44:57,419 --> 05:45:11,740
Dude, we're going on 10 hours, man. What do you want me to say? It's right here. Okay, let's

1073
05:45:11,819 --> 05:45:42,659
fucking destroy this guy right now. I didn't- so he's a mage. Fuck you, Gideon.

1074
05:46:14,729 --> 05:46:32,060
Oh, that hurt me too. Fuck you. Okay, magical. Magical protection. I'm wearing-

1075
05:46:33,419 --> 05:46:38,139
excuse me. Magic protection. I need to put it on. I don't know what I'm doing. I- I'm just

1076
05:46:38,139 --> 05:46:41,819
giving- I don't know what I'm doing right now. I'm doing fucking Donald Trump. It's like fucking

1077
05:46:41,819 --> 05:47:02,439
nine and a half hours, 1230. I'm gonna play this game, Gideon. I don't- I don't get this.

1078
05:47:03,400 --> 05:47:06,840
Wasn't the whole time, Gideon, like, oh yeah, we have this place for you,

1079
05:47:06,840 --> 05:47:11,479
tarnished and tarnished, come and go, and we're gonna do the Elden Lord stuff. Yeah,

1080
05:47:11,479 --> 05:47:15,639
go get the runes and become El- why is he- no, no, don't be Elden Lord. How dare you.

1081
05:47:15,639 --> 05:47:21,299
What is he talking about? Didn't- wasn't he the one that wanted us to do this?

1082
05:47:21,860 --> 05:47:26,459
Or does he just want to do it himself? I got news for you, Gideon.

1083
05:47:27,580 --> 05:47:37,689
There ain't a chance in hell that you're- actually probably better than I am, yeah.

1084
05:47:37,689 --> 05:47:45,290
I need magic. Magic defense. That doesn't do anything else besides magic. Magic? Oh god.

1085
05:47:46,090 --> 05:47:49,110
So many pieces of armor. I don't- I have no idea which is better.

1086
05:47:49,830 --> 05:48:07,689
Oil Knight? Uh, some of these are probably better up here. All right, you piece of shit.

1087
05:48:12,630 --> 05:48:17,029
And I'm not gonna cast spells at him. I'm just gonna go bash his head in with this will.

1088
05:48:17,990 --> 05:48:55,720
What's up, dude? Runes, who cares? I don't need them. I'm gonna fucking beat him, all right?

1089
05:48:55,720 --> 05:48:58,520
No, I want to see what's- I want to see what's in that door.

1090
05:48:59,319 --> 05:49:05,590
I want to see what's in that door. It's right there. I'm not gonna- I know it's the final boss.

1091
05:49:05,590 --> 05:49:37,369
I'm not- I just want to see what's in the door. Holy shit, that hurt a lot. You idiot.

1092
05:49:40,459 --> 05:49:47,819
And who could forget Sir Gideon Ofnir? We all know him. There he is.

1093
05:49:48,779 --> 05:49:51,099
You drink?

1094
05:50:15,020 --> 05:50:26,619
What's happening to my brain? This dude's wicked high.

1095
05:50:28,279 --> 05:50:32,200
All right, I'm just gonna go in there and I'm gonna go with my fists and I'm gonna fucking

1096
05:50:32,279 --> 05:50:39,060
crush his head. He's actually throwing. I just- I'm fine. You gotta do a comedy one sometimes,

1097
05:50:39,060 --> 05:50:44,860
okay? You gotta do a comedy one sometimes. That was a good strategy and I'm gonna do it again.

1098
05:50:47,000 --> 05:51:06,259
Sorry, everybody. I apologize. I do. I'm gonna stay across the fucking whole room. What is he

1099
05:51:06,259 --> 05:51:45,110
doing? Now, all rise. You're tarnished. You're dead. Die, you old fuck. Ain't nothing in there,

1100
05:51:45,110 --> 05:51:50,700
is there, Gideon? You're out of spell power, aren't you?

1101
05:51:58,759 --> 05:52:31,180
Hey, butters. Hey, beavers. Scepter of the- Oh, you get- He's got awesome armor.

1102
05:52:32,619 --> 05:52:42,549
I love his armor. It's so cool looking. Can I put that on? So what's- I don't understand

1103
05:52:42,549 --> 05:52:48,250
what his problem is. All-knowing helm. Helm set with countless eyes and ears,

1104
05:52:48,250 --> 05:52:53,450
won by Gideon Ofner, the all-knowing. Knowledge begins with the recognition of one's ignorance.

1105
05:52:54,090 --> 05:52:59,130
The realization that the search for knowledge is unending. But when Gideon glimpsed into the

1106
05:52:59,130 --> 05:53:16,069
will of Queen Merika, he shuddered in fear. At the end, that should not be. I love that helmet.

1107
05:53:16,709 --> 05:53:53,990
I have to keep the head on. All-knowing armor. Light. Really light. Wait, in case you didn't

1108
05:53:53,990 --> 05:54:17,500
notice, he had all the boss powers? He did? Okay, I- that- I'm now- I- it's- it's time to go- I'm

1109
05:54:17,500 --> 05:54:22,220
gonna- I'm going in the Erd Tree. I'm probably- I'm gonna lose, right? I don't think I'm gonna

1110
05:54:22,220 --> 05:54:40,299
beat this boss. I'm not prepared for it. Oh, the staff! He did have a staff. I've got an entire

1111
05:54:40,299 --> 05:54:54,599
museum in my backpack. Honest to God, where is it? It is int scaling. Scepter in the form of a hand

1112
05:54:54,599 --> 05:55:00,279
grasping a pearl. Signature weapon of Sir Gideon Ofnir, the all-knowing. Pearl stands for the world,

1113
05:55:01,240 --> 05:55:07,400
the heavens, and an eye. Representing the many forms of knowledge, never fully attainable.

1114
05:55:07,959 --> 05:55:18,150
Even knowing that, the all-knowing's hand grasps for it. Knowledge above all. Raise the scepter to

1115
05:55:18,150 --> 05:55:23,430
manifest the realm of the all-knowing. Enemy magic and holy damage negation will be reduced for all

1116
05:55:23,430 --> 05:55:46,040
within the area, including the caster. How long does it- this is- this is a weapon.

1117
05:55:47,720 --> 05:56:01,930
This is not a staff. This is an actual swinging weapon. It's a mace. Oh, shit, it is.

1118
05:56:02,650 --> 05:56:07,959
That's really cool. I'm gonna have to check that out. I mean, literally with the end of the game,

1119
05:56:07,959 --> 05:56:17,180
whatever. All right, I- it's- we're going on 10 hours- 10 hours. I know. I gotta speed things up

1120
05:56:17,180 --> 05:56:20,700
here. I want to go in this door. I just need to know. I want to see what- I want to see Queen

1121
05:56:20,700 --> 05:56:32,409
Merica. Definitely fucking in there. Definitely in there. Guarantee it. I want to see Queen Merica.

1122
05:56:32,409 --> 05:57:01,799
I need to go up to the urn-free entrance place, which is up here, right? He has returned. The

1123
05:57:01,799 --> 05:57:06,840
Lord has returned at long last. Our very first Lord to brandish the Elden Ring once more.

1124
05:57:07,639 --> 05:57:36,810
Are you talking about me? I didn't think I had to jump. I thought I was just gonna fall on it.

1125
05:57:46,680 --> 05:58:06,360
And Sir Gideon Arthas arrives. He tarnished. He dead. He lives. That intro is so good. It's a

1126
05:58:06,360 --> 05:58:10,840
great intro. It almost feels like it's like a- like a- promoting like a wrestling event.

1127
05:58:14,419 --> 05:58:22,549
Like hype up- hype up all these superstars. How many times have you watched it? Well,

1128
05:58:22,549 --> 05:58:47,240
at least a couple of times. That's it, probably 20 times. Bird Tree Heal. I have any idea what the fuck

1129
05:58:47,240 --> 05:58:54,569
is going on in this game. Vastly heals HP for self and nearby allies. One of the ancient urn-

1130
05:58:54,569 --> 05:58:59,290
bird tree incantations. Heals a vast amount of HP for the caster and nearby allies. Hold to continue

1131
05:58:59,290 --> 05:59:04,810
praying and delay activation. The urn tree once flourished with abundance, yet it was only for a

1132
05:59:04,810 --> 05:59:18,569
fleeting moment. Such is the course of all life. A moment. A fleeting moment. The urn tree like

1133
05:59:18,569 --> 05:59:35,130
actually had power. Deer. All right, I want to know. What the fuck is it? What's in here?

1134
05:59:35,130 --> 06:00:01,189
What is it? Here we go. I'm turning it up. This thing that's getting the shit out of me.

1135
06:00:02,709 --> 06:00:37,880
It's been a long disdow fight. Farnished warrior. Spurned by the grace of gold. Be assured the

1136
06:00:37,880 --> 06:01:04,790
Elden Ring resteth close at hand. Who the fuck is this? I am returned. Wait, is that-

1137
06:01:07,830 --> 06:01:12,229
To be granted audience once more. Godfrey?

1138
06:01:19,540 --> 06:01:30,409
But what is he? How did he- How did he- As Godfrey, the first Elden Lord.

1139
06:01:36,759 --> 06:01:45,080
Godfrey, the first Elden Lord. Where have you been this whole time?

1140
06:01:46,630 --> 06:01:53,110
I was hiding behind that pillar over there for the last 600 game hours. You just didn't see me,

1141
06:01:53,110 --> 06:02:26,630
but I was snooping. I gotta jump. I gotta jump with that shit. I gotta jump. I didn't want to

1142
06:02:26,630 --> 06:03:12,389
take a rune arc. I wanted to- That's not good. Bomb up. Dude, fucking stop kicking the ground,

1143
06:03:12,389 --> 06:04:01,500
you dick. Oh shit. Dude, yikes. Ambo, you gotta help me here, man. Ambo, please. Ambo, please help

1144
06:04:01,500 --> 06:04:32,840
me. Dude, base two. You gotta fight the goddamn- You gotta fight the lion.

1145
06:04:33,799 --> 06:04:39,189
Speak of service, Sirosh.

1146
06:05:03,459 --> 06:05:31,830
I've given thee courtesy enough. They're into a street fighter character.

1147
06:05:32,869 --> 06:05:47,909
I fight just horror alone. Wait, the- Wait, the chief of the Badlands? Wait,

1148
06:05:47,909 --> 06:06:10,169
the chief of the Badlands from the intro? Oh my god, he's actually fucking zangy.

1149
06:06:16,439 --> 06:06:27,639
That ain't gonna work against this. I don't think so. Oh, I don't know about that. I don't know

1150
06:06:27,639 --> 06:06:44,540
about that. Where was this guy the whole game? Wait, Godfrey? I'm Godfrey. I'm God- No, I'm kidding.

1151
06:06:44,540 --> 06:07:01,209
It's me. Horlou. It's me. It's me. I'm Horlou now. Horlou is Godfrey. There's so many names in this

1152
06:07:01,209 --> 06:08:05,380
game. I know it's time to go to bed, but let's round it out at 10 hours. Come on. Oh, it's a

1153
06:08:05,380 --> 06:08:28,619
little early, but I'm fine. Oh, fuck. Too greedy. Let me do it again. I thought he was gonna hit

1154
06:08:28,619 --> 06:08:46,540
phase two. I was really thinking if that was phase two. That wasn't bad. Mambo's getting his ass

1155
06:08:46,540 --> 06:08:55,290
feed. Mambo is making me happy. He's the chieftain of the Badlands when he's just hanging out.

1156
06:08:56,889 --> 06:09:38,630
That doesn't make any sense. Close enough? Don't jump into it. What, are you stupid?

1157
06:10:07,750 --> 06:11:13,290
Oh, shit. That's bad. I'm dead. Kick. What the fuck? The suplexes. Jesus Christ.

1158
06:11:28,180 --> 06:11:33,380
I'm getting so fucked up here, dude. I'm getting so fucked up. I'm getting so fucked up.

1159
06:11:34,259 --> 06:11:42,439
Dude, I'm getting so fucked up here. I don't fucking have any idea what happened here.

1160
06:11:42,919 --> 06:11:59,990
I don't fucking have any idea what's going on. Jesus. No. There's so much going on. Just get away from me.

1161
06:12:06,520 --> 06:12:28,860
Grow. Oh, I'm dead.

1162
06:12:36,439 --> 06:12:46,409
Casting is too slow. Oh, I got the magic resist gear on. Shit. Did somebody say? You're gonna say

1163
06:12:46,409 --> 06:12:59,299
so bad. Oh, come on, man. This fight is fucking cool. You gotta get.

1164
06:13:00,419 --> 06:13:36,229
I don't know. Should I just go full oven mitts? Okay. I'm ready. I am going to wait to summon

1165
06:13:37,830 --> 06:14:27,189
my buddy. Phase two. Oh, shit. He doesn't. As sloppy as fuck, I'm gonna tell you.

1166
06:14:27,830 --> 06:15:25,590
Get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Come on, Gwen. Come on, Gwen. This guy's just fucking being

1167
06:15:25,590 --> 06:16:55,900
the shit out of me. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck you, bro. Bro. I had to do that. Isn't it? Oh, shit.

1168
06:16:58,020 --> 06:17:05,290
Oh, I'm dead. Stop healing in front of him. Dude, he's just fucking so fast.

1169
06:17:10,310 --> 06:17:12,869
Actually, there's probably not a window to summon in phase two. You're right.

1170
06:17:15,959 --> 06:17:22,939
Going like ding, ding, ding, ding. No, you're fucking dead. I got him. I got him. I got him.

1171
06:17:23,500 --> 06:17:32,779
Out of something right before phase two. That's the play is you got to get somebody. You got you.

1172
06:17:32,779 --> 06:17:40,840
He's just so relentless. All right, let's go. This fight's fucking awesome, by the way. This is the

1173
06:17:40,840 --> 06:17:53,419
best fight in the whole game. This is the best fight in the game. I will stand by that. I gotta

1174
06:17:53,419 --> 06:19:13,209
wait a second for this. I should. Yeah, that was dumb. Let's just be balls. No, man. All right.

1175
06:19:13,209 --> 06:19:35,509
Come on. Oh, my God. All right. I got him. I got him. I got him. I got him. Here we go.

1176
06:19:36,729 --> 06:20:00,409
Oh, get in there, Mambo. Come on. Shit. I thought he was going for Mambo.

1177
06:20:01,209 --> 06:21:31,259
Mambo, please get aggro, please. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sit down. I almost fucked it up like three

1178
06:21:31,259 --> 06:21:49,540
times. Remembrance of Hora Lou. But, dude, who's Godfrey? The same person. It's the same guy.

1179
06:21:49,540 --> 06:22:04,389
That was the best fight in the game by far. That was by far the coolest fight in the whole game.

1180
06:22:05,029 --> 06:22:37,110
Is it health or is it endurance? But fair. Yeah, that was so fun. God, that was the best fight in

1181
06:22:37,110 --> 06:22:43,900
the game. I wish I could do that again. And the remembrance. I think I'm gonna do endurance,

1182
06:22:43,900 --> 06:22:51,099
right? Like, it's the safe thing to do. I want to read this because... So what, people,

1183
06:22:51,740 --> 06:23:04,759
you change your name? Oh, I'm Godfrey, but I'm also Hora Lou. I don't get it. Where is it?

1184
06:23:04,759 --> 06:23:19,049
This is a paragraph. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was robbed of his grace,

1185
06:23:20,009 --> 06:23:24,659
becoming tarnished, he took with him his kinfolk and left the lands between.

1186
06:23:25,299 --> 06:23:31,080
After the long march of the tarnish came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship,

1187
06:23:31,720 --> 06:23:46,779
becoming a simple warrior once more. Godfrey got exiled and then changed his name. Hurry up

1188
06:23:46,779 --> 06:23:51,500
and end the stream. The Europeans are gonna wake up any second now, Monka S. I look so awful today.

1189
06:23:52,139 --> 06:23:58,380
I'm the sweatiest I've been probably in the last month, at least. This is the sweatiest stream by

1190
06:23:58,380 --> 06:24:04,700
far. All right, lore masters, I need to ask a question. If I go in, if I go in there and see

1191
06:24:04,700 --> 06:24:24,419
what's in there, is the game end? Only if I... Okay, I kind of want to... Let me see what's up with

1192
06:24:24,419 --> 06:24:34,139
Godfrey. I know we're going really late, but let me just see what's in here. Where is that going? Oh,

1193
06:24:34,139 --> 06:24:53,419
yeah. Okay, so are the fingers gonna talk to me now? Dude, what are you doing? What the fuck?

1194
06:24:56,650 --> 06:25:04,200
They just fucked off. They don't care anymore. Okay, I want to see what this remembrance is.

1195
06:25:15,849 --> 06:25:24,020
But if you're dead, how are you doing this? Axe of Godfrey, dex strength, 42 strength. Damn.

1196
06:25:24,819 --> 06:25:29,580
Weapon of Godfrey Elden Lord, it was broken in a battle fought as leader of the tarnished

1197
06:25:30,139 --> 06:25:34,860
during the long march. This weapon is symbolic of Godfrey's vow to conduct himself as a lord,

1198
06:25:35,419 --> 06:25:38,939
later becoming an emblem of the golden lineage. In the days of the past,

1199
06:25:39,580 --> 06:25:49,610
the crown was warranted with strength. Or Oralu's earthshaker. Oralu's earthshaker slammed

1200
06:25:49,610 --> 06:25:59,060
both hands into the ground. Okay, that's awesome. Heavy. This is strength stuff.

1201
06:26:02,250 --> 06:26:13,459
They said they wouldn't talk for thousands of years. Read Godfrey's icon talisman. Do I have

1202
06:26:13,459 --> 06:26:32,279
that? I don't have it. All right, it's time to go in there. I'm not going to use either one of these,

1203
06:26:32,279 --> 06:26:35,799
but I'm not going to break it because in case I don't want to lose the souls. It's time to see

1204
06:26:35,799 --> 06:28:44,040
what the fuck is inside the tree. Finally. Let's do it. What's in here? Title theme.

1205
06:29:02,709 --> 06:29:57,799
Radagon of the Golden Order. Damn. That's a little display on that. Thought I could jump it.

1206
06:30:04,490 --> 06:30:51,880
Oh shit. Okay, I gotta stay behind him. Don't blast it. Shit. Not bad. It's not bad. Oh fuck.

1207
06:30:52,599 --> 06:31:12,860
Oh my goodness. Okay, you gotta run. I just want to see phase two. I want to see phase two and I'm

1208
06:31:12,860 --> 06:31:31,959
done. Radagon. I just want to see phase two because this is not the fight. Mom said it's my turn to

1209
06:31:31,959 --> 06:32:21,610
be Elden Lord. So what? I don't get it. How do you get away? I think you have to dodge through it.

1210
06:32:32,840 --> 06:33:30,409
Dude. What the fuck? I just want to see fucking phase two. Oh my God. I just want to see you

1211
06:33:30,409 --> 06:33:55,779
turn into another fucking monster or something. I got to get that down if I'm going to see phase

1212
06:33:55,779 --> 06:34:21,369
two. Dude, I don't know where the fuck to go. Why is it on phase? Oh, oh, I get it.

1213
06:34:38,790 --> 06:35:07,189
Show me phase two. I got it. I don't know. Phase two. I got it. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get

1214
06:35:07,189 --> 06:35:20,250
it. I'll get it. This is fun. You've got to earn phase two. It's so late. I know. I'm so sorry.

1215
06:35:20,250 --> 06:36:04,950
This is so bad. But I gotta go for it. Oh, you do it twice? What's this whole shit?

1216
06:36:05,669 --> 06:36:11,540
That was a bad fucking combo. That was dog shit and you all know it.

1217
06:36:13,290 --> 06:36:24,200
This is dog shit and you all know it. I've never seen him do that fucking move. What is he doing

1218
06:36:24,200 --> 06:37:14,330
that? Oh, come the fuck on. Dude, stop doing that. He's done that move like 50 times this time.

1219
06:37:15,049 --> 06:37:45,639
Do something else. My God, you're going to drive me fucking crazy. Jesus, I dropped my head back.

1220
06:37:49,130 --> 06:37:54,090
He just kept throwing those stupid fucking spears. He did it like 10 fucking times.

1221
06:37:54,650 --> 06:37:57,849
Stop doing that move. Do something else. You have like 40 moves.

1222
06:38:00,900 --> 06:38:08,060
I just want to see phase two. You keep getting hit. Yeah, because it's like he goes, huh? Boom,

1223
06:38:08,060 --> 06:38:13,659
then they explode. And sometimes he does two. Sometimes he does two. This game is a three out

1224
06:38:13,659 --> 06:38:32,950
of 10. It's a three. Wait, I can summon in here? Oh shit, I can summon. I didn't think it would be

1225
06:38:32,950 --> 06:38:40,419
allowed in here. Fighting the fucking Elden Lord. I don't remember your name in the intro,

1226
06:38:40,419 --> 06:38:58,169
dickhead. Dude, show me phase fucking two already so I can go to bed. I just want to see what it is.

1227
06:39:01,270 --> 06:39:14,740
Mambo, help me. Oh no, you got flabbered. That was so sad.

1228
06:39:18,409 --> 06:39:38,020
You didn't, Mambo. What the fuck is that? Get it, Mambo. Oh, Mambo's way outmatched here,

1229
06:39:38,020 --> 06:40:18,250
I think. I just got glassed. Doing it again. What? Show me phase two. Let's see it. Phase two

1230
06:40:18,250 --> 06:40:30,869
incoming. Mambo, just touch him, please. Get it. Mambo, settle down. Save your strength. You're

1231
06:40:30,869 --> 06:42:04,840
going to need it. Dude, what are the fingers? I don't get it. What is that? Elden beast. Mambo,

1232
06:42:04,840 --> 06:42:31,590
hold on. Yeah, we can't even get over there, Mambo. That was a good run. Oh, she just

1233
06:42:31,590 --> 06:43:03,060
liquid-fired him. Mambo just got liquid-fired. Oh my god. Okay, you guys are screwed up.

1234
06:43:03,060 --> 06:43:40,099
What are these? What is this? I don't get it. They're just fingers? Talk to people?

1235
06:43:40,819 --> 06:43:47,369
All right, do I have to do phase two again? Do I have to do phase one again?

1236
06:44:00,869 --> 06:44:03,509
They really want to fuck you up here, huh?

1237
06:44:07,479 --> 06:44:10,599
Yeah, they're really looking to fuck you the whole shit up, huh?

1238
06:44:14,340 --> 06:44:17,380
All right, well, that's cool. I am definitely not doing this tonight.

1239
06:44:18,340 --> 06:44:33,240
We'll come back to this. I'm just doing... I just spit everywhere. I'm not even playing. Look,

1240
06:44:33,240 --> 06:44:38,919
I'm not even playing. I'm just sitting around. It's not even going to be playing today. See,

1241
06:44:39,000 --> 06:44:42,919
he just hit me so bad. I'm dead. I'm going to die right here. He hit me so hard.

1242
06:44:43,959 --> 06:44:51,819
I'm not even playing. See, look, I fucking got hit by a regular attack. Are you kidding me?

1243
06:44:52,380 --> 06:45:10,090
What a shitty player, right? I don't even have any mana. I'm not even trying. I'm not even playing.

1244
06:45:10,090 --> 06:46:08,099
Oh my god. How do you get away from that? You got to be shitting me. Am I seriously too far away?

1245
06:46:08,740 --> 06:46:40,439
I'm not even playing. Just checking it out. You're making pick his own bedtime.

1246
06:46:41,400 --> 06:46:55,240
Okay, Elden Beast. I'm going to get in close. Stay right behind you. I don't know. Stay in

1247
06:46:55,240 --> 06:47:21,270
underneath. You don't want me to sit. Oh my god. You're so fucking far away. Can I get on the horse?

1248
06:47:31,349 --> 06:47:58,419
What do I fucking do here? This is not where you're supposed to be. All right, good night.

1249
06:47:58,419 --> 06:48:30,150
I'll see you later. I don't have any heals left. Whose hand is that? I don't get it. It's aliens.

1250
06:48:31,580 --> 06:48:34,459
All right, I'm done. That's enough. That's enough. Okay, that's enough.

1251
06:48:36,360 --> 06:48:54,389
Well, there's the Elden Beast. Okay, this guy told me. Where was he? Is he still around?

1252
06:49:12,119 --> 06:49:20,340
Three fingers. What the fuck are the fingers? The two fingers. The three fingers. The Elden Beast.

1253
06:49:21,139 --> 06:49:36,779
I don't understand. I can't believe that dude. That two fingers abandoned us and we're in the

1254
06:49:36,779 --> 06:49:50,619
tree and this motherfucker doesn't care. I'll be back in 10,000 years. Horse shit. Where you at?

1255
06:49:52,139 --> 06:50:29,700
Honestly, still just hanging out there. Well, okay. Pretty cool. I'm going to bed. Have a

1256
06:50:29,700 --> 06:50:36,180
wonderful evening and wonderful sleep everybody. Sorry we went so long. That was a lot going on

1257
06:50:36,180 --> 06:50:41,990
today. We did bro versus bro with Ludwig. We're out of the end of Elden Ring. I didn't beat it,

1258
06:50:41,990 --> 06:50:53,500
but here we are. Damn. Very cool. I have a lot more questions though. The next stream,

1259
06:50:55,540 --> 06:51:05,939
I will see you guys on Sunday. We'll go Sunday. So nothing today technically and then nothing on

1260
06:51:05,939 --> 06:51:21,299
Saturday. I'm going to try to beat Elden Ring on Sunday. Hopefully. Check the Godfrey armor.

1261
06:51:21,860 --> 06:51:56,900
Uh, didn't I get so many armors? Where is it? Oh, it's at the finger lady. Right. Okay.

1262
06:51:57,939 --> 06:52:15,349
Elden Lord Crown. The age of the urtree began amongst conflict when Godfrey was Lord of the

1263
06:52:15,349 --> 06:52:21,270
battlefield. He led the war against the giants, faced the Storm Lord alone. And then there came

1264
06:52:21,270 --> 06:52:27,029
a moment when his last worthy enemy fell. And it was then as the story was told that the hue of

1265
06:52:27,029 --> 06:52:47,740
Lord Godfrey's eyes faded. I didn't register any of that. No, I didn't. Godfrey fought

1266
06:52:48,540 --> 06:53:05,779
Acid Disax, the dragon, and four or five extra sweet sours in his bag. I was like really happy

1267
06:53:05,779 --> 06:53:17,369
about it because you get to save them. You're only going to use one. I don't. Okay. There's a lot.

1268
06:53:17,369 --> 06:53:25,509
I'm going to watch the baddie video. Wasn't that dragon was an Elden Lord? What the fuck is an

1269
06:53:25,509 --> 06:53:30,709
Elden Lord? I keep hearing these terms and I don't know really what any of them actually mean.

1270
06:53:31,430 --> 06:53:45,349
Oh, tarnished. Two fingers. Elden Lord. Elden Lord. So, a dragon was Elden Lord, which means that

1271
06:53:45,349 --> 06:53:54,650
the greater will, right? Like, yeah, that's fine. The dragon's an Elden Lord. This guy killed the

1272
06:53:54,729 --> 06:54:00,340
dragon and like became Elden Lord and they were like, oh shit. Um, okay.

1273
06:54:05,029 --> 06:54:20,500
Tarnished are people who lost grace. But what is grace? What does that mean? Elden Lord is like a

1274
06:54:20,500 --> 06:54:43,159
God's chosen person. Grace is the guidance of God. It's the guidance of the greater will. Okay. So,

1275
06:54:43,159 --> 06:54:55,849
why did I burn the urn tree? What are we doing in here? Just because you wanted to get inside.

1276
06:54:56,810 --> 06:55:16,220
Get the Elden Ring, you idiot. Because the world sucks. Okay. I guess that makes sense.

1277
06:55:16,860 --> 06:55:27,419
I'm very interested in the lore. I really am. So, is the greater will and the urn tree the same

1278
06:55:27,419 --> 06:55:40,340
entity? What the fuck is the urn tree? Why is the urn tree even here? Who planted that shit?

1279
06:55:41,509 --> 06:55:47,669
Who planted the urn tree? What is the howling tree? Why is there a howling tree?

1280
06:55:47,669 --> 06:55:51,880
Why is there so many- why do those people have trumpets? Why is there so many trumpets?

1281
06:56:00,330 --> 06:56:03,930
All right. All right. I'll see you guys. I'll see you later. I'll see you on Sunday.

1282
06:56:09,610 --> 06:56:19,240
Why do they have trumpets, baddie? Please tell us. Very interesting. That's cool though. So,

1283
06:56:19,240 --> 06:56:30,119
Horoloo is Godfrey. Godfrey. We fought Godfrey's yellow shade in the- why was he not here? Remember

1284
06:56:30,119 --> 06:56:35,700
it was like he was bright and gold and we fought him in that- before the throne room and then he

1285
06:56:35,700 --> 06:56:45,700
shows up again later. Oh, hey, it's me, Godfrey. Was that him fighting us? Was it somebody pretending

1286
06:56:45,700 --> 06:57:07,540
to be him? It was a force ghost. It's cool. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. Just

1287
06:57:07,540 --> 06:57:18,490
go with it. I am. I'm just very curious. And what's- what is- with Gideon so badly was like,

1288
06:57:18,490 --> 06:57:24,009
oh, you are gonna stand- wasn't he like, oh, we both- well, you're gonna stand before the Elden

1289
06:57:24,009 --> 06:57:29,049
Lord. Oh, that's what we tarnish do. That's what we do. Don't go stand in front of the Elden Lord,

1290
06:57:29,049 --> 06:57:49,979
you dick. All right. Watch the lore video. I think there's still more to know because this is-

1291
06:57:49,979 --> 06:57:54,540
obviously this is an end of the game, which is going to be something, right? All right. I'll see

1292
06:57:54,540 --> 06:57:57,819
you guys later. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. Staying up late. That was a meaty one.

1293
06:57:59,180 --> 06:58:03,259
This is the longest stream I've done in a long time. I think the first, second or third Elden

1294
06:58:03,259 --> 06:58:09,560
Ring stream was pretty long. I'm gonna give this game a three. We'll bump it up a little bit. It's

1295
06:58:09,560 --> 06:58:27,290
like a 9.7 maybe. That's cool. What a cool game. I'm- is it weird that I'm sad? I'm kind of sad.

1296
06:58:29,189 --> 06:58:39,380
It's not over yet, but it is- it will be really soon. It's sad. We'll get another stream out of

1297
06:58:39,380 --> 06:58:54,310
it. I still have to rage quit Milani again. I've got to kill the glass boss. Pretty much it.

1298
06:58:59,979 --> 06:59:02,700
Ending of playing your first playthrough of a masterpiece is always sad.

1299
06:59:04,139 --> 06:59:12,229
Yeah, I kind of look at the map. I'll go to bed in a second. It's just like- this was a journey.

1300
06:59:12,229 --> 06:59:15,909
This was absolutely a journey. I have no idea what the hell's really going on, but

1301
06:59:16,950 --> 06:59:34,740
it sure was fun walking around through the sewers as well. Three fingers. I did fight Mog.

1302
06:59:35,540 --> 06:59:47,099
Yep. I killed- yep. I killed Rikard. I killed Mog. Very cool. No, this is- it's fantastic. It is.

1303
06:59:49,689 --> 06:59:56,650
Well, think about this, right? I will leave you with this. I have been playing this game a lot.

1304
06:59:58,889 --> 07:00:08,020
We have officially passed more than a month of playing this game every single time I turn the

1305
07:00:08,020 --> 07:00:16,380
stream on. A month. I can't remember the last- even other From Software games. I can't remember the

1306
07:00:16,380 --> 07:00:29,159
last time that a game has kept my attention for more than 100 hours. I don't think so. Nothing

1307
07:00:29,159 --> 07:00:36,729
has kept my attention for this long. But Elden Ring streams are not going to stop because I'm

1308
07:00:36,729 --> 07:00:45,029
going to try to beat the game. Let's hope I do it. I will eventually, right? I want to do an invasion

1309
07:00:45,029 --> 07:00:52,439
like PvP summon night. I think that'd be fun. Do some like- have like a community password

1310
07:00:52,439 --> 07:01:00,869
and just fuck around. Also might need to do the Me Strong stream. Yeah, I'm not done with it. I-

1311
07:01:00,869 --> 07:01:17,130
the game is too good to leave it completely. Oh, it's April Fools. I got nothing for you. I'm

1312
07:01:17,130 --> 07:01:34,520
too tired to have anything for you. Gotta do something weird. Here's the joke. Happy April

1313
07:01:34,520 --> 07:01:43,450
Fools, everybody. Beating the game tonight. I'm- I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's a joke.

1314
07:01:44,009 --> 07:02:04,860
Look at my eyes. God, I look like- my face looks- I look weird. You beady eyes.

1315
07:02:05,740 --> 07:02:14,950
Stop. Do a tier list. Legit do it. I'm not- I can't. That was a joke. I'll see you later.

1316
07:02:15,750 --> 07:02:27,349
99 hours? I'm gonna go over 100. Come on. All right, good night. Thanks for watching, as always.

1317
07:02:27,349 --> 07:02:35,799
I'll see you guys later. See you on Sunday. Somewhere around four o'clock Pacific. We will

1318
07:02:35,880 --> 07:02:42,419
try to beat this game. Here's some of the other stuff that is in the game. And depending on how

1319
07:02:42,419 --> 07:02:50,250
long that takes, we will potentially go into some PvP stuff. Maybe I'll do some summoning stuff. If

1320
07:02:50,250 --> 07:02:55,930
you guys want to summon me to your game. You want to summon me, German985, to come and visit

1321
07:02:55,930 --> 07:03:04,360
your game. That's right. One of you lucky few will get German985 to come and enter your game.

1322
07:03:09,400 --> 07:03:22,069
Help me fight Milani- okay. Maybe we should just Mario Party Milania. It doesn't matter.

1323
07:03:30,569 --> 07:03:36,439
We Mario Partied the Dragon in Dark Souls 3, and I don't think we even beat it. I think I had three

1324
07:03:36,439 --> 07:03:55,849
or four of you guys come in, and we still couldn't do it. Do a hamburger helper tier list. I will be

1325
07:03:55,849 --> 07:04:07,500
very upset if you do that. That fight sucks. It's so bad. It's just too much. I definitely- okay,

1326
07:04:07,500 --> 07:04:17,060
before trying to do Milania, like really grind out the hours to eat Milania, I'm gonna have a

1327
07:04:17,060 --> 07:04:24,680
full breakfast. I'm gonna have to take some vitamins. I'm gonna need a full like eight hours

1328
07:04:24,680 --> 07:04:36,979
of sleep. I need to be ready. Do a From Software boss tier list. That actually sounds like fun,

1329
07:04:36,979 --> 07:04:43,779
although I don't really remember all that much of some of the other games. I would need some

1330
07:04:43,779 --> 07:05:00,659
refreshing, but that'd be fun. Well, thanks for taking the journey, as always. Have a good night,

1331
07:05:01,299 --> 07:06:01,669
and call your mother. See you guys soon. Not right now. Good night.
