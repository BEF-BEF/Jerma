1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:08,300
It was a little odd. For some reason my steam wouldn't connect. I had to like force quit it and then open it again.

2
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:10,779
Weird.

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:12,220
Anyways, hello.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:26,179
Welcome back. I'm doing all right. I can't say I'm at 100% right now.

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,339
Because that would be a lie.

6
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,460
And you go ahead and make a new one. Dermal lied about being at 100%.

7
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:37,189
Because as the days progress here on this medication,

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,149
I feel like it's probably gonna get worse.

9
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,750
As we as we go forward over the next another five or six days.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:01,369
Oh, end of the life. No, I'm fine. It's just

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm I'm all right.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,040
I can't this is one of those things you just can't talk about on stream and you just can't

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,650
just know

14
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,689
that

15
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,489
Like what the fuck? That's all you need to know.

16
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:26,810
But we're gonna continue our fear playthrough from yesterday.

17
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,299
I think we probably have an equal amount of time.

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,540
Left so I've been told this probably about four hours five hours maybe left in the game. We're just gonna do it today.

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
What happened? I missed it.

20
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,819
Uh, I guess i'll just talk about all right. Well

21
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,859
the nature of live broadcasting

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,260
and the nature of twitch and

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,859
Live stuff is people that were there yesterday may not be there tomorrow.

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,900
And the people that weren't there yesterday may be here today.

25
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,830
So it's um

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,830
That's people wonder why well, well you you've already talked about this like three times

27
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,150
well, it's because

28
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,189
You may not have been here two days ago. And if you were maybe your friend right there sitting at the table

29
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,639
May not have been here yesterday either

30
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:28,250
but um

31
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,250
Yeah, i'm on a couple of new medicines

32
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,050
i'm having some stomach issues that uh

33
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,169
I we think are completely unrelated

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,849
to

35
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:40,520
Uh, like colitis and stuff

36
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:45,560
So i'm trying some new stuff and what it does is it's causing me some discomfort

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
It discomfort in quotes

38
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:56,490
And I have to do it for a while. So the streams over the next week or so up until probably around halloween

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,580
Are gonna be shorter

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,580
But i'm gonna do more streams

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,419
That's pretty much the way it's gonna work. You're gonna get less time on stream, but you're gonna get more days streamed

42
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,090
There you go spread it around pass that around the lunchroom

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,080
And I don't really even need an intro here

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:26,599
Because we already know what's going on, but I do need to tweet something. So let me do that real quick

45
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,569
Spread the word

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,969
Well, don't spread don't spread it too much

47
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,389
Because it's not gonna be a it's not gonna be permanent

48
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,909
It's only gonna be for like a week or two

49
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,580
finishing

50
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,930
fear

51
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,930
I'm having a good time with this game though

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
If you didn't catch the stream yesterday

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
This is uh, this is a good one

54
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:13,180
And it really makes me want to play the other ones even though I know that i'm gonna be disappointed but still

55
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,899
It's the same company. It's the same franchise. Could it really be

56
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,300
worse

57
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,189
by that much

58
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:27,750
Two is all right. The three is the bad one

59
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:35,110
Fear two is all right fear two is fine. Okay, so fear three is not the same company monolith didn't do fear three

60
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,970
Okay. All right. All right

61
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,220
Fear two is good

62
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,180
All right, that's bad

63
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,019
I think I want to do them

64
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,699
Even if fear three sucks, you don't think we should do the three we don't believe we shouldn't do the trio

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Well, I hate that game to a point where there's a meltdown on stream and I like quit the game halfway through. What do you think?

66
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,600
Is it not worth doing?

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:12,100
it may be

68
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,939
Never mind. You should play it. All right. Now we see where now we see where you're uh

69
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:19,990
Now we see where your true intentions lie

70
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,529
All right, let's go

71
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,110
Hi

72
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,850
Hi, it's me

73
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,930
So the last thing that happened

74
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,100
Let's break down the story here

75
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,100
scary girl

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,259
Find this guy

77
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:42,949
Kill that guy pretty fun game

78
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,300
Pretty much that's that's that's pretty much the plot of every horror game

79
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,259
All right, i'm going in

80
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,379
I I can't see anything you guys are saying. No fear three isn't a bad game. It's just not a good fear game

81
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,459
It's worth playing if you like fear one

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,699
We'll see

83
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,699
I should probably at least do fear two

84
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,110
But this I got all this stuff to do

85
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
There's a lot of games to play

86
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,810
All right, I apparently saved it

87
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:19,449
Where was I? Okay. Let me just check the audio level boom. That's really really loud for me, but it's probably all right for you

88
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,290
I can't tell is it really bad? All right play the expansions to fear one. All right

89
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,100
Maybe we'll do that too

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,329
Oh, I know why it's loud for me

91
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:39,420
Because I had to turn this up last night. Oh, it should be good for you

92
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Check this out ready

93
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
That may have been too loud for you

94
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:51,319
Ow

95
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,319
Oh, i'm wasting ammo

96
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,259
Am I running?

97
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,399
Why am I not wait? Why am I going slow?

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,189
Oh, it's because i'm crouching. All right

99
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,670
Or how am I doing on health? Okay. I got how many health packs do I have?

100
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,750
The last thing I did. All right, right. Okay. I turned off the gas

101
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,959
from what I remember and then I

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,639
Yeah, no, I have to turn off the gas and then go up there

103
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,699
So the gas was over here

104
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,699
He didn't notice he was crouching

105
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,879
Yeah

106
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,740
Yeah, okay

107
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,819
All right. So this I went down but

108
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
No, this is why I came around

109
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,649
I didn't really pick the best place to stop

110
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,290
because

111
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,529
I kind of it's like i'm turned around here

112
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,569
I should have gotten the end of this section last night, but I just couldn't I couldn't do it

113
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,579
Does this take place after I didn't I turn it off already?

114
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,060
Did I pick the wrong save?

115
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,160
I may have picked the wrong save

116
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,089
What a chad

117
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:35,779
Really? I already got scared by this. Yeah. Yeah, I picked the wrong save

118
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,250
Like it's the wrong save that happened to me. Let me and do you remember what I said yesterday?

119
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:50,620
And I still feel the same way that ended the stream last night. That hurt me again

120
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,370
That was the one

121
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,370
Why did I pick this save?

122
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:02,629
No, I can't turn it off now

123
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:14,970
All right, where i'm fine. So that's turned off now. I'm gonna go up here. It hurt me it did

124
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,620
Keep out

125
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,149
I don't think it will

126
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:31,110
What the fuck is in here health facts health upgrade? All right. No, I don't want to go down

127
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,470
Wait charge up the flashlight

128
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,039
This is no, I need something with actual

129
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,600
What there's no I know no ammo in any of my guns

130
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,620
None of my weapons have ammo

131
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,340
Okay, so then now I can climb up the

132
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,350
Is this thing over here I can go through there or yeah, let's go through here

133
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,820
Because that's that

134
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
All right. Now I can go up the ladder

135
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,360
Oh

136
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,559
nice

137
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,860
Save it

138
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,159
Yeah, okay

139
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:27,080
This is where we stop

140
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,320
Yeah, I loaded the wrong safe. That's my bad. That's on me

141
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,860
This is the wrong safe

142
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,320
It's okay though. Don't worry because this is where this I remember

143
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,720
Stopping here

144
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:50,580
Let's go up

145
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Uh, I guess we're gonna go over here

146
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,340
water

147
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,419
This is a water valve or is this a steam valve?

148
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:04,120
And I don't mean that I really don't mean that as a reference to any video game companies I actually mean like a

149
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:14,809
like a steamer

150
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:19,610
I I honestly did not mean that as like a that's this is a funny valve like valve joke

151
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,169
Like a company valve what is going on over here?

152
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:33,929
Okay, well the water's up

153
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:35,929
Am I killing somebody right now?

154
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,700
Yes

155
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Oh, that was a good joke

156
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,860
Gay Ben

157
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
No, that's not what I was doing

158
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:56,250
Gay Ben

159
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,110
Remember when that was like the funniest thing you could possibly say

160
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:05,000
You might it still might be I don't know. Did I get everything in here?

161
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:10,629
Wait, hold on

162
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,950
Okay, what what year do you guys think?

163
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,879
had the best

164
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,450
memes

165
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,230
Do you think it was like 2011 2012 2013?

166
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,090
I think i'm missing something here

167
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,450
2012 started a lot of fucking weird stuff

168
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,539
Can I swim?

169
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,830
Okay, i'm just gonna swim

170
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,070
2010 to 2015 I would even say probably

171
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,350
I'm, not sure I would put I don't know if I'd go as far as 2015. That's a little too far. I think

172
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:57,429
Turn it on turn it off. Oh shit. I just turned it on

173
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,860
What like shitty design that is down is not on down is off

174
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,799
Up is on like a light switch. That's universal. That's like go that's driving on the right side of the road in

175
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,000
America or on the left side of the road in europe like come on

176
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,919
Up is on down is off

177
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,059
Well that I did that now I'm just gonna go back

178
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,809
They are hard to turn on

179
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,710
Oh, that's why

180
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,590
Because you need to like put weight down to turn it on. All right. I just thought it was right. Whatever you're right

181
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:45,450
Up is off loser

182
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,450
Here we go checkpoint

183
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,379
There's probably gonna be fucking monsters and shit here now so I could be ready

184
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:01,289
I can now go through the door the elevator

185
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:11,720
Oh

186
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,159
Somebody else

187
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,620
Who the fuck is here?

188
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:24,330
Oh

189
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,330
What is happening to this guy's head?

190
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,169
Save him

191
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,559
There is no saving that one

192
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,769
Okay. Now I can go

193
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:51,419
Uh, wait, I can actually I can use this right? What if I want to go two one?

194
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,419

195
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,539
Stop

196
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:10,139
Okay, just how do I all right they're gone

197
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:29,379
Okay, intercept

198
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:34,950
Uh, did the elevator did the elevator just open behind us? I don't know. I don't care. I

199
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,179
I just you exploded

200
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
Wait, did he what did he say?

201
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:45,539
You exploded

202
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:52,600
Oh shit, you exploded

203
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,019
Oh, no

204
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,870
Oh shit

205
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,870
This game is fucking so fun

206
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,070
Okay, here we go shotgun. I like the shotgun the best

207
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,539
Although this thing sucks. It really does. It's just not very good

208
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,220
The hell are you doing?

209
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,039
Pick it up

210
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,159
What are you?

211
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,440
Hey

212
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,860
Okay, 65. What do I have the heels might as well use one

213
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:42,379
I feel like i've been completely just totally neglecting the pistols. I think I used it once in the first five minutes of the game

214
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,139
I feel kind of bad

215
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,330
You know what I mean? I feel like I wanted is it just bad

216
00:16:53,750 --> 00:17:05,910
There's a lot of ammo and

217
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,589
That just scared me

218
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,109
All right, what's in here?

219
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,029
Anybody in here?

220
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:15,990
Okay, I don't know why my brain decided that this is what it was going to do

221
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,349
But I was going to hit control to see a hitman boom and look at points of interest

222
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,920
You know, it's it's the way that this looks this room is a hitman room. You know, you know, does that make any sense to anybody?

223
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,799
This is a hitman room

224
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:50,180
It it is that's why I wanted to do it it makes sense somebody's gonna be in here no computer computer

225
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:00,099
I was gonna close all the one but

226
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I decided that was not worth my time

227
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
Look out. It's getting it's high voltage

228
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:14,230
Should I

229
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,730
That's new music

230
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,579
Oh

231
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,660
It's the human garfield. I forgot. All right

232
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,740
I love how human garfield has his own jokey like fairy tale music

233
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:51,210
Christ I thought I was a goner to you guys. The elevators are offline and those soldiers are everywhere

234
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:54,630
Feed him should I feed him security office and override the lockdown?

235
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:01,319
All right, let's feed him

236
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,759
That didn't feed him

237
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
He eats

238
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:24,119
Nobody move he usually eats him remember oops. Oh my god, he's just wearing a hat

239
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,089
Dude the whole the whole building just went up

240
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
Okay. Well, that was fun

241
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:59,059
override the security lockdown

242
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
You created a black hole

243
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,339
Somehow accidentally. All right, I got my shotgun

244
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Yes, I did think that was a person for a second

245
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,339
It's a horror game. Come on. It's hard to not think the shadow is a monster

246
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:22,950
imagine getting hit right in the face by a absolutely more than eight to ten pound weight and just

247
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,069
Going like this

248
00:20:26,069 --> 00:20:28,069
without even flinching

249
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,069
What a true chad

250
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,880
Uh, no guys, no

251
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,410
Oh

252
00:20:50,410 --> 00:21:24,059
What's in there? Wait

253
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,900
I fucked up his toaster. Sorry

254
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,140
What somebody open the door?

255
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,299
No, that's a waste of a grenade. Come back

256
00:21:49,339 --> 00:22:44,059
Saves come. Yeah. Let's try and see if it was good could contain the blast

257
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,859
Just

258
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:08,490
Okay, we already heard it so

259
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,410
Where is this security room then through here?

260
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:23,940
Somebody's gonna that guy getting eaten eaten in one of these he's gonna come somebody's gonna fall out of one of these

261
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,420
A monster or something a new enemy type

262
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,180
It's just completely and totally absolute

263
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:40,220
Oh shit

264
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,779
Good work

265
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:44,779
That guy was very unsure

266
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,579
What?

267
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,579
Wait, what is going on?

268
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,099
So I threw

269
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:36,200
I frisbeed in to the room. They couldn't see me. I they didn't they didn't know where I was quick

270
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,940
All right, I need uh

271
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:56,259
Where is he stop talk sit all clear. I didn't where was he? I don't even hear it

272
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:02,500
I want to stick this on one of his like butt cheeks

273
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:13,859
It's so important the music the music is

274
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,079
What

275
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,569
Okay

276
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:39,430
Uh, all right. I got him was he uh, that's cool. All right, but who cares?

277
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:50,339
I had to reload the fucking gun

278
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:03,349
That thing actually is not very good

279
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:06,309
It's not not very good. You have to shoot him like three times in the head

280
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,690
Just only use the shotgun. It's the best weapon in the whole game

281
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,700
Was that guy shooting at him?

282
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:43,880
I think he was shooting at him. I have no idea

283
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,609
That guy was on my team

284
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,299
He could have been

285
00:27:54,299 --> 00:28:05,990
I'm stuck

286
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,990
How do they not see me that whole time?

287
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,650
He's trying to flank

288
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,450
He's running straight at me. He's flanking us

289
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,299
shit

290
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,220
I'm never gonna be able to

291
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Hear them say that and not laugh at it

292
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,500
That's shit

293
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,420
What i'm looking for is i'm looking for three people in the same room four people and it's oh shit. Oh shit

294
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,420
Oh shit

295
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
I want to hear it four times in a row

296
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:47,880
That's the only thing I want what the fuck is that

297
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:58,220
There's a rocket launcher

298
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,059
I want to have five people in a room rocket launch explode. Oh shit explode. Oh shit

299
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
I want the pitch to keep going down

300
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,619
That'd be the ultimate video game laugh out loud moment for me

301
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:16,339
All right, let's go

302
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:22,549
Save it

303
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:24,549
We got two in a row

304
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:26,549
Can we get like four in a row?

305
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,450
Oh, uh, it's gonna take just dice thrown in the air

306
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:40,230
it's

307
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,970
What it's

308
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:54,329
You shoot three

309
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,329
Okay, this is too good to use right now

310
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,680
It's just it's I don't want to use this. It's too good

311
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:19,289
I wasted it. I know that's all right, though

312
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:25,299
I'll get more ammo for it and I will only use it. I thought it was a one shot. That's why

313
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:35,019
It's still open

314
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:40,809
What the fuck? Hello? Oh you

315
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:59,819
You're down there

316
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:01,180
No, no

317
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:07,059
Oh shit, nice throw. Oh shit

318
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,509
Why are you holding the gun like that?

319
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,019
Okay, I guess i'll take it

320
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:46,809
I know I can get in there. I'll get this way

321
00:31:50,680 --> 00:32:05,000
Security room. Here we go. He performed final acrobatics before he died

322
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:25,859
Yes, i'm still on hard. Okay. Here we go. Who's coming in?

323
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:34,250
It's gonna why would you have the monitor here? It's gonna be a scary thing that runs by

324
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,180
Apparently not

325
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:49,150
All right, everything is been activated now we have to go back you can leave through here. All right, it's done

326
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:06,799
Nope, that is not gonna fucking happen 14 35 43

327
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,900
Dammit

328
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,420
It's got to be the detonate one

329
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,400
No

330
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:06,700
I have to do this once

331
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:17,030
It didn't I didn't even get it in

332
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,559
You motherfucker, I swear to god

333
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:52,860
There it's in

334
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,099
No

335
00:34:55,099 --> 00:35:07,340
Quick run around to every floor and hit quick sprint up press every button on every floor on the way down running down the stairs

336
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:25,110
That'll fuck him. Why do I keep trusting that guy? That guy just disappears. He doesn't do anything else

337
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,260
He just runs away. All right

338
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:37,690
I was already in here. This is the way to go to where I just was so didn't know the door open

339
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,420
I'm certain that another door opened and then he turned off

340
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,059
That's so annoying

341
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:52,039
Can I even go over here? Oh shit

342
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:55,989
I do I have to meet him upstairs

343
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:12,840
Oh god. Dammit. I do

344
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:21,320
This come on. There's not a health upgrade here. Why would you have this here if there wasn't an upgrade? That's total

345
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:23,159
bullshit

346
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:29,829
What just happened? There's no cool music right now

347
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:48,199
I know what the fuck is a great

348
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,980
Seeing what happened

349
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:07,719
All right, we made it

350
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:17,030
Game saved. What's next? Sayonara sucker

351
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:31,610
It's very very quiet. That means something's gonna jump out. That's audio editing 101

352
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,989
Make the audience have to focus

353
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:43,190
On the fact that there's no audio go. Wait, why is it no then loud noise?

354
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:52,699
It doesn't open this looks like it's on

355
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
Perfect you again

356
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,579
Yeah

357
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You almost didn't fit through the door you almost didn't fit through the door I get the last lap

358
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:39,929
Can I destroy it? Let's just hide

359
00:38:41,829 --> 00:39:01,349
Why is that in here? Why does that exist?

360
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:11,420
Yo, you left you cactus. I don't think he cares. All right, so let's uh go in here

361
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,360
No, no

362
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:27,239
Jesus

363
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,960
So I can't go this way now. There's no make sure don't miss this like no what the fuck's happening

364
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:44,730
Okay, go back. Okay. Well

365
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,289
uh

366
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,289
It's a retro stream

367
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,139
Uh-oh

368
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:04,980
Why why yeah, why is my why is my bit rate so low right now? These graphics suck

369
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:13,110
Why is this happening?

370
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,289
Oh, I think I have a setting

371
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:18,010
I think there's a new setting on like on obs now

372
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:33,079
Where if you if your internet sucks, it doesn't drop frames it drops your bit rate. I wonder this that's interesting

373
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,320
It's 2007 all over again

374
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:47,460
That's better. Yeah, it was like a it was like a pretty revolutionary thing that they were working on

375
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:49,940
I remember I talked to somebody at twitchcon about it

376
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,619
But the real question is how long I wonder

377
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Do we just kind of slowly come back?

378
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,639
Um, let me just do one thing. Let me just look at this real quick. I want to see if this is actually

379
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,539
If that's what's actually happening. I saved it. Hold on. Let me just check something

380
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:17,880
That's very very cool

381
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
Let me just see if that's what it's doing

382
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:30,010
maybe

383
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,010
Because this is for as happening in like real time

384
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:47,320
This is so strange

385
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,880
I didn't think this was on any of the other obs's though

386
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,099
Because I don't think this is enabled

387
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:02,070
What what's this link you guys are spamming?

388
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:05,269
That's what this looked like

389
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:09,380
Oh my god

390
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
That looked like I made it a clay

391
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:20,250
I think that is what's happening though

392
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,250
You know, i'm just gonna say that's what's happening

393
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:27,610
And we're just gonna go back to playing the game because it looks like it's climbing back to like four or five six thousand now

394
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:34,969
interesting

395
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:42,519
What did it hit?

396
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,880
Dude, that is a that is an amazing feature that they came up with though. That's that's

397
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,500
insanely awesome

398
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,340
Because like you won't your stream won't turn the fuck off anymore

399
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,760
That's so awesome

400
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,039
Thank god for smart people making smart things in technology

401
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,119
all right

402
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,320
This is actually the the the bit rate that I used to stream at I used to stream at this exact bit rate at like

403
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,840
4,800

404
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,619
So this is like this is actually uh, twitch.tv slash germa985 from like 2016

405
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,230
2015

406
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:28,070
Can I activate it?

407
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,940
Why can I not turn that on?

408
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,980
Warning video cameras are operating on these premises good

409
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:37,300
Automatic

410
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:47,429
How could you tell

411
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:49,429
All right. I'm going for this is what these are for

412
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:04,119
Excuse me, excuse me

413
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,010
I

414
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:21,909
Huh? What?

415
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,469
Never mind. Those things suck

416
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:27,190
I can't even see where this thing is now. Where did it blow up?

417
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:42,650
That was that was

418
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:44,969
I can't I can't save scum. Just go

419
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:55,860
There's too many health packs

420
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,809
Okay, so

421
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:03,849
See what we do here on germa985 was we make sure that we show everybody our best and our worst

422
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:06,789
This is the mario tennis stream

423
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:07,030
All right

424
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,070
We started out all right

425
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:13,510
And then I started like swearing at people and making fun of people on mario tennis and everybody really hated it and it went right

426
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,389
Down, but I want to make sure everyone knows that we don't do that shit

427
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:20,710
We show the worst that we have but we also show the fucking big recoveries that we have too

428
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,019
This is from the tony hawk pro skater 2 stream

429
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,579
Where I was playing really poorly and everybody was like making fun of me and everyone made fun of me

430
00:45:29,739 --> 00:45:33,820
And then I pulled off a one million point trick and made a ton of great jokes in a row

431
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,460
You can always salvage it. Don't throw it away

432
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,550
and then this one is uh

433
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,909
That that one's tesla. I just I just always want to keep track of it because I trade it

434
00:45:46,789 --> 00:46:01,559
Okay, so

435
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:04,519
No, i'm not doing any chin faces anymore because I know how bad I look

436
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:19,110
Don't die

437
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,889
I'm doing curve at the frog. Why won't these explode?

438
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:52,409
Pull them next to it. Well, what the what it shouldn't explode

439
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:55,340
I need more health now

440
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:11,989
I have a click saved about five minutes. I'm supposed to make a macro for that

441
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:16,059
I'm supposed to make a macro for every time I throw a grenade. It saves the game

442
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:22,010
Okay, uh, let's go that way

443
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:33,190
Right electricity off. There we go. Oh, no, I don't like that

444
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,340
No more turrets

445
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,469
That's a good thing

446
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:46,599
Does that let me open the doors? No

447
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,860
Okay, I think what three hours have gone by

448
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,699
in-game

449
00:47:55,699 --> 00:48:00,869
No, none of these open

450
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,699
That just turned off the turrets. That's it didn't do anything else

451
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,469
That's that nothing else here. All right, i'm gonna go this way

452
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,820
Maybe now I can keep going

453
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,380
further through uh, what's this way

454
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,320
Could go that way. I'll go up

455
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,920
We're down. No, i'll go down

456
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:32,699
I haven't been over here yet

457
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:35,340
health upgrade

458
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:40,230
No, germ is so smart. He can see time

459
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
Um, I can't see time

460
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,920
I can see the system that we have created as humans

461
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:52,039
To be aware of its passing

462
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,239
There's a difference

463
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:57,239
I turned it off. I turned it off

464
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:05,460
Am I missing? Oh god, i'm in trouble

465
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:08,980
I'm just

466
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:20,940
Did I get it? I thought I turned this shit off

467
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,690
Just throw a grenade

468
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:28,429
What do you mean just throw a grenade? The last two times i've thrown a grenade into it. They've magically disappeared

469
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:33,019
A regular grenade would bounce off of it and come back and kill me

470
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,849
I can't use the rockets because I I might need it for something

471
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,400
like this

472
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,789
Like this scenario. This is the scenario

473
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,090
Is this what hackers do?

474
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:03,420
When they put like this is like pulling up to a red light next to a guy in a Lamborghini. Is it like

475
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,780
All right. You ready? Let's go fine

476
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,489
What's he doing? Is he in yet?

477
00:50:26,429 --> 00:50:30,829
I hope I I hope I can just push this guy off like an edge. You know what I mean?

478
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,840
I don't want to like kill this guy. I just want to push him over like a cliff

479
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:42,170
Maybe kill him probably maybe

480
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,960
I can't activate that. So let's just go

481
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,840
Wait one two secrets

482
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:58,329
Remember that kills people

483
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,889
Well, it depends. I don't know

484
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,650
There's a difference

485
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,170
A click guys a kind of pushing somebody over an edge off a cliff

486
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,090
could mean

487
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,889
like on the top of a playground slide or

488
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,250
Like grand canyon, you know what I mean? It's off the edge

489
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:17,050
I just want to push him off a slide. That's what I meant

490
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,400
That's a slide not a cliff. Oh, we could argue semantics here

491
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,929
What is a cliff? What could it be? Like what is an edge? What is like a pushing somebody off of off an edge mean?

492
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,289
Cliff is a well cliff is not a man-made

493
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,280
Why is he running around?

494
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,760
I don't understand what this guy's game is. There's people

495
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:59,360
There's like a whole agency of of weird super soldiers that are killing us and trying to kill everybody and there's

496
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,360
All this awful shit going on. There's a little scary girl

497
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,239
and

498
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:12,000
Why is he running away from me?

499
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,679
Let me ask a question. It's been like six hours in the game. Can you cook grenades?

500
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,000
Yes

501
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,659
No

502
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:38,320
We're about to find out

503
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,599
You cannot

504
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,599
Otherwise this would have exploded

505
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:53,449
So we're just gonna have to use this thing

506
00:52:53,849 --> 00:53:05,519
Here we go

507
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,880
Still there

508
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:16,489
Is it gone? Oh my god, and he's six rockets

509
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,170
Well, that's unfortunate. I can't open this

510
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:41,820
No, no easter egg to get a soda. I get to I get to push him over an edge

511
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,659
I get to push him down the cliff

512
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:45,469
I get to do that

513
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:50,989
I am gonna he's gonna say his last line and i'm gonna push him down the laundry chute. I get to do what i've wanted

514
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,630
I get to do it

515
00:53:53,630 --> 00:54:09,079
I can't wait

516
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:23,900
Oh, come on. He made it in wonderful. I don't get to do my fun thing that I wanted to do so bad

517
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:40,719
That's very disappointing. Let's take a look over here anything that's over here that I need to do

518
00:54:42,440 --> 00:55:03,929
Oh shit, just hold on. Yeah, he's stuck in that vent

519
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,760
Just fill that thing with chocolate syrup and you got the first half of the Willy Wonka movie

520
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:20,670
All right, that's good

521
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,670
Just open the fucking vent

522
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:31,679
Wait

523
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:40,039
Why are these here?

524
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:45,000
Okay

525
00:55:45,000 --> 00:56:27,820
All right, that's gone

526
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:35,369
I think i'm by it by this point

527
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:39,480
How are you still aiming down here? What?

528
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,530
Well, that's a that's a crock of shit

529
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,599
No

530
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,679
Here comes a jupiter storm

531
00:56:53,679 --> 00:57:11,929
Watch out left or right. Uh, let's go right first right looked shorter. Good call

532
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,190
Uh-oh

533
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,000
Um, is it one of those things?

534
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:33,949
You love cocaine

535
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:36,349
I would advise on not doing that anymore

536
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:41,929
I don't think it's not very good for you. I would not do that anymore

537
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:52,760
Clip that yeah

538
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
I would advise on not doing any

539
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:58,280
Thing like that. It's not good for you. It's not good for you

540
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,760
Eat a fucking banana. Okay, eat a banana

541
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,599
What did he just jump out of the ceiling?

542
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,920
He did

543
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Roger. Oh, no, that was roger

544
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,210
That was one of his friends

545
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:04,460
I have one bullet left in this thing. Um, I need a new gun

546
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:12,239
I'm in trouble here

547
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,460
What all right, I'm I have one health pack left

548
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:37,000
Where'd it go? Good

549
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,400
Uh any other ammo or anything? I need a new gun

550
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:51,849
Ooh, perfect a boost to my reaction speed thing

551
00:59:52,570 --> 01:00:13,099
Turn the flashlight off. There's probably more

552
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:33,369
Um, was he destroying one of those turrets? Got him

553
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:56,300
Any more kill that light?

554
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:02,039
All right. I have to replace the I gotta replace the no this thing replace this

555
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,519
I don't the nail gun isn't really that good. It takes too much

556
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:09,079
Even if you headshot it takes like three headshots sometimes

557
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:11,289
That's too much

558
01:01:11,289 --> 01:01:12,969
It should be two one

559
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:31,099
So this is now I can use this not yet. I will be using it though to go up or down

560
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:56,730
Wait a minute. He can shoot through the glass. Okay. Give me some weapons here

561
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:59,960
This thing doesn't come into this room, right?

562
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:20,400
Where is he?

563
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,760
Holy

564
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:44,110
Oh

565
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Come on get in here

566
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,289
I can pick him up. I can pick him up. I can pick him up

567
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:19,179
Here's the plan

568
01:03:19,179 --> 01:03:28,320
You ready for the plan? Okay, pull him over here put a gigantic trap for him

569
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,639
He i'm gonna pull him into this room

570
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:34,559
He's gonna be all the way back here

571
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,400
Get this out a gigantic trap. This guy is fucking dead

572
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,320
There he is. Okay. How are you? Good to see you

573
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:53,179
Now you're dead

574
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:54,380
See you in hell

575
01:03:54,380 --> 01:04:22,539
Now why is the music still going?

576
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,159
All right, I guess i'm out of here

577
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:51,880
It wasn't even hard. It just took all of my stuff. Wait this ammo

578
01:04:52,519 --> 01:05:08,039
I mean, I'm going this is the last the final boss is up here. That's where i'm going. That's a specific noise

579
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
that little like

580
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:25,550
What is that from? I don't know. It's

581
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,030
Oh, it's gonna kill me

582
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,190
It's from mario 64

583
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,190
No, it's not is it really?

584
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:45,630
Okay

585
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,869
Good. I have a hundred now

586
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:49,949
100 armor save it

587
01:05:50,590 --> 01:06:04,219
What's in here another one of those things?

588
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:10,809
That's you're probably gonna have to fight like a few of them. Wait. All right. I haven't been in here yet

589
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:12,780
Right

590
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:19,769
There it is

591
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:26,840
No

592
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,920
Why did I not break that? I should have fucking known

593
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:32,989
Really?

594
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,469
That's the point. That's why i'm doing this see

595
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,650
Because I know that I was there

596
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:55,449
All right, we got water. Let's go given the game is too scary. Please change it

597
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,510
Nah, this is nah, it's not it's not that bad. It's scary but

598
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:14,639
Nah ready? It's gonna go

599
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,860
Do it do it

600
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:24,969
Come on. I'm really off with these predictions today

601
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:33,630
Amnesia is better than this. Well, I mean this is not like a it's not supposed

602
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,269
Okay

603
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:47,309
This is like a shooter game though. That's I mean, it's it. Hey, you don't you can't talk smack about fear

604
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:52,650
I'm this is like a really cool game. I really like this game

605
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,460
And it's like scary, but this is

606
01:07:57,019 --> 01:07:59,099
This old it's not like brand new

607
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,639
See omega lull omega lull l cool

608
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:22,170
I actually really like this game. I think it's really good. I think it still holds up

609
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,289
This many years later

610
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:27,289
Is it toxic gas in here too?

611
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,550
Why would you have a button to press that does that

612
01:08:42,380 --> 01:09:20,060
Is bill back down there? Okay, you might be getting a call from bill. He's a fucking asshole

613
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:37,979
Ask you guys a serious question

614
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:44,699
What was the last time you left or listened to a voice mail?

615
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:57,760
What's the last time you left a voicemail? It's been a while. I think

616
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:03,579
Everybody knows that nobody checks their voicemails. So nobody leaves voicemails

617
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:09,500
Every time I get to a point where I really need to tell somebody something. I got to talk to this person

618
01:10:11,289 --> 01:10:14,489
By the time I leave a voicemail for you if you're not available right now

619
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:20,010
I'm just gonna text you and i'll i'll you'll see that first before you'll listen to a voicemail

620
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:23,579
voicemail is is really just

621
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,829
As you know, I don't have a reason to do it

622
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:33,210
I think like maybe if you like call the doctor or something to like leave but even still you just call again

623
01:10:33,289 --> 01:10:37,050
You call like at 8 a.m. The next morning and y'all you get through to somebody

624
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:45,800
I don't really leave them anymore

625
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:52,010
And I don't listen to them either

626
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,670
Somebody could literally leave me a voicemail

627
01:10:55,529 --> 01:10:57,310
that says

628
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,310
Uh, mr. Albertson, this is

629
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:04,619
Uh free money giveaway incorporated. We have a check with your name on it. There's no quit

630
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:09,260
Literally, this is no questions asked you get a million dollars if you just call me back

631
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,020
This I that's it

632
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,979
It's just a full taxed one lump set payment

633
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:19,819
And it's there's three doctors and two scientists in the room to make sure it's legit and a police officer and a tax attorney

634
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,520
Police call me back within seven days and you'll get it and I I wouldn't get it

635
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:33,260
I would get that voicemail if that voicemail was left, uh, like yesterday

636
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:35,819
I would listen to that voicemail

637
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:37,449
in

638
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,449
July of 2020

639
01:11:39,449 --> 01:11:43,449
When I go through and delete every voicemail that's saved in my iphone

640
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,920
Check now what if it's there?

641
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,409
Well, it's too late. Anyways, if it's there. No, it's too late. Anyways

642
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:02,409
Check now. No, I definitely don't have one

643
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,899
See now a great joke for this stream if I had thought about that beforehand

644
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:14,539
Was to have a voicemail on my phone of that what I just told you and it's like at the end it says

645
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,939
end of message received on

646
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:18,779
may

647
01:12:18,779 --> 01:12:20,119
12

648
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:23,640
2018

649
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:34,000
Oh, well, all right. Let me let me make sure I got everything that I need here. I've full everything

650
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,560
I don't think there's anything else in here. So i'm going to go the way that I'm supposed to go this way

651
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,220
And here this would be an even funnier thing to do

652
01:12:54,699 --> 01:13:00,619
Is have that voicemail a different version of it like six or seven different times over the course of like a full year

653
01:13:05,369 --> 01:13:07,369
Like I had a really good chance

654
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,529
Stop stop what missed lore?

655
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,350
This is scary girl and you're in the facility there

656
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:30,600
Pitch that around

657
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,199
Look, I won't miss this

658
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:35,659
It's not even in there. I don't want that

659
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:39,960
Uh, is this where the here we go. Where are they?

660
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:43,689
Wait, am I gonna

661
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,689
I'm not gonna like poison them. Am I?

662
01:13:46,670 --> 01:14:01,310
Oh, I

663
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:11,800
Do they know where it is?

664
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,069
Who are these people?

665
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:17,710
It's a turret. Don't come in the room with the

666
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:25,439
Why would you go in the room with the turret?

667
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:30,699
Oh shoot. It's a turret in there

668
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:34,859
Everybody go in everybody running at the same time

669
01:14:50,829 --> 01:15:01,710
No, you won't

670
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:12,670
Yeah, yeah

671
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:24,479
Who where?

672
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,170
It's a turret

673
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:28,170
There's a turret in there

674
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:33,369
What's with the cactus? I feel like this isn't a cactus theme

675
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:44,270
In this uh game. Okay, what about down here? What?

676
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:13,979
All right, but who was this did somebody fall off

677
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,340
And they're just like oh, oh well resume patrol

678
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:23,180
These guys know these guys aren't on the same team. Okay, that's good to know

679
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:31,069
Any secrets?

680
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:42,840
What the hell is the atc doing? Okay. Let's sneak around up here

681
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,279
A lot of ammo gonna be up there definitely put up the shotgun again. It's best weapons

682
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:49,529
You heard my gun

683
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:55,359
You didn't just hear my gun. Did you?

684
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:02,989
Okay

685
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:09,149
Uh, look at how many people are up here. This is ridiculous

686
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:12,939
Find him

687
01:17:12,939 --> 01:17:15,819
Well, you did you found me?

688
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,729
A lot of blood a lot of blood here

689
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:32,270
A lot of blood missed lore missed lore

690
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:53,689
What I got five? I don't know what's over here. Is that this the way that I have to go?

691
01:17:54,489 --> 01:17:58,939
I guess

692
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,939
Tell us the lore to mist

693
01:18:01,789 --> 01:18:02,590
I

694
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:03,869
Couldn't do that

695
01:18:03,869 --> 01:18:10,399
I couldn't do that

696
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:14,000
I don't know mist as you wake up on an island and you have to figure out why you woke up on the island and then

697
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,680
I guess leave the island

698
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,680
Is that somewhat accurate?

699
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,720
at least

700
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:28,750
slightly accurate

701
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,899
I couldn't stop

702
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:55,979
That may have just ended the stream. I sneezed the shit my pants. Kidding

703
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:02,810
Where is he? Oh health. I want that

704
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,520
nice health

705
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,029
upgrade

706
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:21,420
lore

707
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,420
He's no, i'm not

708
01:19:54,199 --> 01:19:59,520
Sure, don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore

709
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:05,520
Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore. Don't skip lore

710
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:29,949
Instead of their doom a war is coming. I've seen it in my dreams

711
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:35,550
Fire sweeping over the earth bodies in the streets cities turn to dust

712
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,970
retaliation

713
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:44,029
This guy's doing a really great job of doing the random voice lines that play

714
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:49,789
When you spawn for the first time in a league of legends game as a champion

715
01:20:51,069 --> 01:21:13,479
It's kind of all he does

716
01:21:13,479 --> 01:21:16,039
fucked up medical stuff fucked up medical stuff

717
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:26,359
Who you know, the game starts to get hairy when there's a bunch of fucked up medical stuff

718
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:30,039
Like what are they? What are they doing in here?

719
01:21:30,439 --> 01:22:04,430
All right, I got the upgrade. Wait, is this something else? I just ruined this gear

720
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:56,189
Stop stop it. What is that?

721
01:23:14,699 --> 01:23:18,029
Wait, what?

722
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,180
I have to slow down

723
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,489
He did like a push-up

724
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:52,529
What how would you know it's me what if I was one of your colleagues what i'm trying to hide

725
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,260
That was not even slowed down but it sounded like it was

726
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:41,000
They all of them have been so far the whole game. They've been

727
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:47,640
That one was not slowed down. It was not during a slow down period. It was just

728
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:55,850
shit

729
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:59,050
God damn it. This is I love this game. What a fun game

730
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,520
Looks like we missed the party

731
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,579
If anything has taught me anything in my whole life

732
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,020
Ever since the talkback came out from home alone

733
01:25:29,579 --> 01:25:34,140
If you slow anybody's voice down by 30 or 40 percent, it's funny every time

734
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,109
The talk boy the talk back. Yeah, the talk boy

735
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,420
Everybody had everybody had a talk boy

736
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:59,260
What what do you mean heads?

737
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,789
He dropped it on the how did you

738
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,829
How did you do that?

739
01:26:08,909 --> 01:26:13,640
That's impossible

740
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:34,829
They all sound like orcs like ogres

741
01:26:36,810 --> 01:26:39,069
Yes, they do

742
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:46,800
uh

743
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,739
Ogre

744
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:53,100
Oh my god. Oh, it looks like we missed the party

745
01:26:57,529 --> 01:27:02,010
All right, let's is lauren here if there's lauren here. I'm gonna intentionally skip it

746
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:08,029
No

747
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:13,659
What what are they fighting?

748
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:29,359
I'm helping

749
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:46,270
Hey

750
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,869
He fucking he was trying to get away

751
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,180
He was going like

752
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,539
He was trying to like shitting backwards just run. Why are you doing that?

753
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:08,170
Instead of like like sliding backwards turn and sprint

754
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,210
Oh my god

755
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,880
My doctor is gonna be mad at me

756
01:28:20,270 --> 01:28:22,750
I'm supposed to be just like taking it easy

757
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,739
I'm sorry doc. I I couldn't help it

758
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,640
But you should have seen what the guy did

759
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:39,760
He flew up. I I the guy was going this way and then he got magnetized his face to the wall and blood splattered

760
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,399
He's gonna be like what the fuck are you talking about?

761
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:48,199
Oh

762
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:50,199
Show him the cliff

763
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,359
Doc, you gotta see this. It's fucking hilarious

764
01:29:00,329 --> 01:29:05,449
Yeah, you don't understand the guy was magnetized and his head hit the wall and blood went there and he like flew this way

765
01:29:05,689 --> 01:29:09,609
And the other guy went oh shit really really slow because time was slowed down

766
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:18,430
And then he stepped back with his being exploded. It's gonna be like jeremy. Um, I would like maybe to refer you

767
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:25,399
It's like what?

768
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:29,239
Yeah, and then we have this that that 15 000 seagulls were saved

769
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:52,270
Oh, it's a big guy

770
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:55,319
No, it's not skee ball. God. Damn it

771
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:27,390
Okay, I feel like i'm playing against my little brother in an online multiplayer game

772
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,670
And he doesn't really understand how to actually play an fps correctly

773
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:36,939
And i'm just trying to give him an opportunity to to like think he's doing a good job

774
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:44,189
Oh shit, it's that was fun

775
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,899
Move your camera

776
01:31:47,899 --> 01:31:49,899
No, I can't there's nothing up there for you to see

777
01:31:50,859 --> 01:31:52,619
There's all bullshit up there. There's nothing up there

778
01:31:52,699 --> 01:31:55,260
How do I can't move it because then if I move it it'll go in the wrong spot

779
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:59,500
I know i'm not gonna move it. I'm not going to that's final. That's final. That's my final word

780
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
I'm not going to move it not moving it

781
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:25,050
locate alice wade

782
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:27,789
bc

783
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:31,640
We've got funny music. No, that's not

784
01:32:32,439 --> 01:32:37,770
All right. This is my shot. This is my shot. This is my shot. I have to make this work

785
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,079
Why would you throw a?

786
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:59,760
Shit

787
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,760
Why would you throw a grenade?

788
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Because you saw light over here

789
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:12,729
Oh, oh, I threw it whoops I screwed that up. Oh shit. Oh my god. This game is fucking ridiculous

790
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:30,359
Oh, he knows what he did immediately after throwing oops

791
01:33:39,579 --> 01:33:46,430
Really what was that explosion?

792
01:33:55,470 --> 01:34:06,859
Can I say I want to see it can I see that I want to see it

793
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:11,020
I need to see the grenade. Oh shit that I have to somebody has it right and I don't

794
01:34:11,739 --> 01:34:13,100
I need to see it

795
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:20,119
I can hear his intestines melting. I just want to watch it

796
01:34:20,859 --> 01:34:26,300
You know if you see a really awesome part of the movie and you want to just rewind it and see the that part again

797
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:39,520
Mashed banana. What the fuck is this? Here we go. Here we go. Here we go

798
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:45,479
I just I just need to see it

799
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:49,000
No, not this one

800
01:34:50,439 --> 01:34:53,069
Not this one

801
01:34:57,689 --> 01:34:59,689
The one that just happened

802
01:35:09,689 --> 01:35:12,250
When he throws the grenade down the hall

803
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:24,680
Oh here it is. Here it is. Okay. Here it is. I just want to see it. Just give me a sec

804
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:42,270
Why would you throw a the best part about this one is you can't really hear him but it's on the screen

805
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:55,239
Here show us you just no, I just want to see it

806
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,430
We're back to our regularly scheduled program

807
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:13,390
Whoa?

808
01:36:13,390 --> 01:36:15,390
You want to fucking go you want to try this?

809
01:36:16,699 --> 01:36:18,699
You want to do it like this? Good

810
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,479
Can you throw it? Can you get it in here?

811
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,239
Get a grenade in here get a grenade in here. You can do it. No terrible

812
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,880
Fucking awful your buddy

813
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:29,880
I want your buddy to do it one of you. Come on

814
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:47,689
If I won't move you get it in here do it get it in here. No, not very good

815
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,890
This is just the dunk tank again. I gotta be up a little higher. Come on up here

816
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:18,090
I don't have any heels left

817
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:21,520
What?

818
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:59,390
He ran out of ammo. Let's go. I need heels. I need a heel. There we go

819
01:38:00,619 --> 01:38:05,819
Any more in here? Give me something else. Give me some more. Give me some more lore

820
01:38:06,539 --> 01:38:28,380
skip

821
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,220
Pistol, no

822
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:32,060
No pistols

823
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:36,029
I already got these cool

824
01:39:00,939 --> 01:39:08,439
Are you are you checking it out? Your first instinct is to throw a grenade

825
01:39:10,109 --> 01:39:41,069
I thought he was aiming up here

826
01:39:41,069 --> 01:40:07,800
Fuck that's a big guy. Did you throw a grenade? I don't know. All right, it's time

827
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:30,560
Fire every single

828
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:51,960
Weapon at that man. Do it hurry unbelievable. He shot me through a wall

829
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,199
Flat flashlight

830
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:12,029
I'm gonna die

831
01:41:12,029 --> 01:41:23,149
Hold on. Is there health pack?

832
01:41:23,149 --> 01:41:25,550
There's probably one secret health pack that I didn't get

833
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:28,510
And I need it bad

834
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:38,010
I definitely don't need it. I don't need it. I need it

835
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:59,050
Damn it. I'm in trouble

836
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:08,750
He's gonna do wait, what do you mean? It's gonna despawn. What are you talking about?

837
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:12,119
What's gonna despawn?

838
01:42:12,180 --> 01:42:19,359
despawn

839
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:21,359
That big guy dropped Excalibur

840
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:25,770
Well, what the I don't give a shit

841
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:30,329
I can't use it. Anyways, that's that's not how Excalibur works

842
01:42:33,840 --> 01:43:05,470
You don't just pick up Excalibur and go this is neat and use it. Nice peek. It sucks

843
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:15,479
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

844
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:18,170
Where are you? Where are you?

845
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:22,800
This is why I don't play games like BR he could be in any of these bushes

846
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:27,920
I have no idea and he could see me and I don't know where he is. I don't know where he is

847
01:43:28,829 --> 01:43:42,800
No, but he's an awful player. He just installed the game like an hour ago. Yeah, I I don't br

848
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:46,010
I don't I don't br. I don't do it

849
01:43:51,949 --> 01:44:03,149
Flying low. Oh my god

850
01:44:09,609 --> 01:44:23,609
How does it one way you do that? You're watching the stream

851
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:28,329
There's no other way that's possible

852
01:44:33,979 --> 01:44:45,880
Trouble here. Let's go. Let's go

853
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:57,180
Oh duck

854
01:44:57,180 --> 01:44:59,529
Oh

855
01:44:59,529 --> 01:45:06,399
No

856
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:07,840
No

857
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:45,600
I gotta stick them. This guy sucks

858
01:46:00,939 --> 01:46:05,520
Go, what are you doing? Did I get hit by it? What the hell hit me?

859
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:21,659
I'm fucked

860
01:46:21,659 --> 01:47:10,680
I'm in deep shit right now walk forward shoot it with the gun

861
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:26,760
Um, i've shot him with the gun a thousand times. He's not here yet

862
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,859
Shoot it until it dies

863
01:47:31,949 --> 01:48:11,680
That's good advice god, how did I use all my heels already? Why how could you not make that jump? That's

864
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:19,930
Ridiculous get it get it get it pick it up. What the fuck is happening?

865
01:48:23,659 --> 01:48:30,010
What is this? Oh fuck. Hold on. I'm gonna be squad

866
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:37,609
Kelpax. Oh

867
01:48:37,609 --> 01:48:46,829
Oh, he was he freaked me out so bad

868
01:48:48,539 --> 01:48:50,539
I don't know why he was freaking me out

869
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,760
Okay

870
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:58,640
I have to make it into that fucking room, but this time if you have this if you have the detonator out

871
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,720
You can't pick up any items

872
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,720
Okay, here we go new strategy

873
01:49:04,439 --> 01:50:05,079
Start walking down here. Is this stupid enough to work? All right. All right. All right. All right

874
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:10,720
No

875
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:42,569
Pick it up. See you later. We can't hit him sir. He's behind a glass door

876
01:51:06,569 --> 01:51:11,850
No, he's just watching your life. Oh, this is not good. Oh shit

877
01:51:14,119 --> 01:51:19,560
That's my line

878
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:23,359
Okay, don't use this that's for emergencies only

879
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:45,050
Uh, okay. I thought this was like a google satellite image of like a warehouse and roads and stuff. I was like, where is that?

880
01:51:49,819 --> 01:51:52,430
All right, let's go

881
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:54,430
What's the next step here?

882
01:51:54,510 --> 01:51:56,350
Computer no

883
01:51:56,350 --> 01:51:58,569
No out here into the left

884
01:51:58,569 --> 01:52:02,010
Take out the assault rifle. Let's get the most range. Let's get the most range on everything else

885
01:52:02,569 --> 01:52:06,109
Up here and through that door sure thing

886
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:25,600
I get more

887
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,600
Wait, kill the lights

888
01:52:31,319 --> 01:52:34,109
Why would you kill the lights?

889
01:52:34,109 --> 01:52:37,149
How can you see me in the dark? Do you have night vision?

890
01:52:41,239 --> 01:52:44,569
No, he can't see me

891
01:52:44,569 --> 01:52:52,560
I just like proved that he

892
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,560
He cut himself off

893
01:52:56,239 --> 01:53:05,710
Get down. Oh shit

894
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:19,449
All right, let's help kind of up against the clock with health here

895
01:53:20,489 --> 01:53:23,119
I need some better

896
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,239
Skill so I don't keep losing

897
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:29,119
I'll turn the lights back on for god's sake

898
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:40,680
They were sitting in the dark now, that's embarrassing they were huddled together terrified god

899
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:52,079
Nothing else

900
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:59,520
No, we should turn it off again. Is that the guy standing?

901
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:19,760
He uh, you think I have attention problems

902
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:49,319
I have to stop laughing at this. I have to like

903
01:55:05,529 --> 01:55:07,529
You throw a grenade in a dark room

904
01:55:07,689 --> 01:55:08,890
Oh

905
01:55:08,890 --> 01:56:25,399
Pretty awful. Okay health. It's strange. There's a piece of shit. That's all the health that's here. Let's go

906
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,180
75 hp

907
01:56:31,180 --> 01:56:34,539
Is not enough hp, especially when you're playing on hard mode

908
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:40,859
It's dangerous. That's where I just was

909
01:56:42,109 --> 01:56:44,520
Hey, look at this

910
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,710
ooh

911
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:58,810
Nothing here. Well

912
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:06,010
Um, there's nothing I can interact with in here. That seems a little strange. It's like the only place I can go

913
01:57:09,470 --> 01:57:16,460
Out the window because I was just down there wasn't I or was I not down there?

914
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:28,939
Maybe I wasn't down here. I guess I wasn't down here

915
01:57:37,689 --> 01:57:40,869
interval seven

916
01:57:40,869 --> 01:57:58,960
Redirection nothing. Okay, cool locate alice's office. I believe it's probably here somewhere. Look at a computer

917
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:12,170
There it is. I'm not skipping it

918
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:16,510
Except for me because i'm the third or i'm the first. No first is the girl

919
01:58:17,229 --> 01:58:19,229
Second is fetal third is me

920
01:58:19,390 --> 01:58:21,359
I mean

921
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:23,359
Come on, do I do I need to spell it out for you?

922
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:39,529
Okay

923
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:41,529
No health packs. That's not good

924
01:58:42,779 --> 01:58:49,800
Why?

925
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,079
scary

926
01:58:51,079 --> 01:59:01,640
scary thing

927
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:05,979
There we go handsome minds good

928
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:23,039
Uh, oh, okay. That was kind of creepy

929
01:59:31,159 --> 01:59:44,920
Oops, looks like we're getting in

930
01:59:49,369 --> 02:00:13,500
Is human garfield dead? I don't think I don't think so. It's possible. I would assume we'll see

931
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:46,079
That character again. All right, here's some lore. This sounds real important

932
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,760
received on

933
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,720
june

934
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,710
3rd

935
02:00:56,710 --> 02:01:10,619
1991 no, I think if you if you work in a in like a corporate environment, you have to listen to your voicemails every morning

936
02:01:10,619 --> 02:01:11,659
Don't you?

937
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:14,239
That's how it works

938
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:28,640
I want to get that. What is it? Where's this ringing phone?

939
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:33,239
Was it not even in this room?

940
02:01:33,239 --> 02:02:00,670
I would have loved to have seen whatever scary thing was in here, but the venetian blinds prevented me from going in

941
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:05,420
Are you serious? Really?

942
02:02:10,090 --> 02:02:19,930
I could just go into the door. Where's this phone?

943
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:23,130
This is fucking driving me crazy

944
02:02:23,930 --> 02:03:29,899
Proteus i'm gonna find the other guy's office. It's not it break room. I mean we'll get in apparently, right?

945
02:03:29,979 --> 02:03:43,739
No, not yet. We could do that later. I need to get health. Where's this fucking phone?

946
02:03:46,199 --> 02:04:08,220
Oh, well, maybe in another lifetime. I'll get it. Oh it fell crap

947
02:04:09,180 --> 02:04:20,890
Wow, it fell this way

948
02:04:21,850 --> 02:04:31,659
Uh

949
02:04:31,659 --> 02:04:49,979
Efficiency is not more important than safety. How much further do I have to go?

950
02:04:51,340 --> 02:05:10,090
Hey, okay. There's a supernatural force blocking the door. Nice supply room health

951
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:24,010
Give me something else something more than that. No, no, no, there's nowhere else. I can go up here

952
02:05:25,579 --> 02:05:31,199
Fine, I could go up. Let me just see what happens if I go up

953
02:05:37,529 --> 02:05:43,979
Good thing I went up

954
02:05:43,979 --> 02:05:50,430
Surprised there's no uh upgrade up here. That definitely is

955
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:55,949
somewhere, right

956
02:05:55,949 --> 02:06:11,689
Nope climb it climb it down

957
02:06:18,510 --> 02:06:22,119
All right, let's find what was this guy's name to find the other this other guy's office

958
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:32,489
All right. Well, we're at a checkpoint good and then pick up the phone in his office

959
02:06:43,050 --> 02:06:45,050
Wait, these soldiers are eating people

960
02:06:47,399 --> 02:06:51,470
I don't think that's what's going on

961
02:06:51,470 --> 02:06:53,789
Why would somebody those guys are not eating people are they?

962
02:06:54,430 --> 02:07:01,869
Was that ever implied?

963
02:07:01,869 --> 02:07:05,899
I'm not sure that's the case

964
02:07:06,699 --> 02:07:08,699
Oh, what the fucking hell

965
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:34,409
I'm not going over there

966
02:07:34,409 --> 02:07:36,729
Doesn't read the lore starts asking what's happening

967
02:07:37,289 --> 02:07:42,159
What I mean, I I know what's happening

968
02:07:47,159 --> 02:08:05,899
We've listened to all the lore. I missed one lore. We listened to you

969
02:08:06,699 --> 02:08:29,050
Not really. It was that one time when the guy was talking about um

970
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:33,289
Uh, like why are you not?

971
02:08:33,979 --> 02:08:35,979
Talking to me. I'm trying to call you

972
02:08:36,699 --> 02:08:52,359
What anybody left? I think that's it

973
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:21,600
I see you up there

974
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:26,800
Oh, and here's another thing though about like the lore every time that I open up like a piece of lore or listen to lore

975
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,560
I look over and somebody writes l omega lul re

976
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:35,119
You gotta talk to those people not me

977
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:50,199
No, that that's that that's it's not me. What you heard the face break

978
02:09:52,909 --> 02:10:02,649
Ow, okay

979
02:10:02,649 --> 02:10:16,220
That was a little odd

980
02:10:16,220 --> 02:10:26,380
Turn the light off just use the door like a regular human, please

981
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:40,989
All right, let's go

982
02:10:58,109 --> 02:10:59,310
There it is

983
02:10:59,310 --> 02:11:19,119
Oh, they heard them. They heard the message

984
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,970
that like

985
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:36,970
Who's shooting me from where?

986
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:57,550
No, you can't somebody finally gets it somebody gets it i'm actually surprised by that

987
02:12:01,180 --> 02:12:15,520
I don't want to i'm not gonna i'm not gonna shoot that guy weird. I got owned

988
02:12:34,079 --> 02:12:36,159
Um, why is there an alarm going off right now?

989
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:57,210
flashlight off

990
02:12:57,210 --> 02:13:01,659
Data no already picked up everything over here

991
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:11,069
Why does this shit make you laugh but fuck doesn't because they don't they they don't say fuck all the time

992
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,640
Scott

993
02:13:25,550 --> 02:13:40,680
Case in point that's why it's funnier. I think that's it, right?

994
02:13:41,560 --> 02:13:43,560
I still live I have to go to

995
02:13:44,279 --> 02:13:49,020
Let me see where where where where where was I?

996
02:13:49,899 --> 02:13:53,680
I got turned around

997
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:57,199
This door doesn't open

998
02:13:57,199 --> 02:14:06,960
So I have to go away through here. There we go. Is that door open?

999
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:12,989
Can I go through here?

1000
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:14,479
Come on

1001
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:19,840
There we go

1002
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,000
It doesn't really do anything for me. Just kind of wraps back around

1003
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:28,489
Uh, uh, yeah, I know i've wanted to go in that other room though

1004
02:14:29,899 --> 02:14:33,640
I got the health pack

1005
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:35,800
All right. Uh, where the fuck am I supposed to be going though?

1006
02:14:37,229 --> 02:14:39,229
locate the this guy's office

1007
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:50,920
I have not found this office yet. Somehow is it not in here?

1008
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:08,750
I don't I shouldn't go down

1009
02:15:10,109 --> 02:15:12,109
Was there a room that I didn't go in up here?

1010
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
He's just walking over dead bodies

1011
02:15:16,399 --> 02:15:28,920
You should have read the lore

1012
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:30,600
Was I in the red area?

1013
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:32,840
I just didn't go in the right spot

1014
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:35,659
Well, we'll try it again

1015
02:15:35,659 --> 02:15:37,659
So this is where I was before

1016
02:15:38,569 --> 02:15:42,729
So this is like the middle room that goes through here's like a little break room

1017
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:49,899
I guess I mean have I gone through here?

1018
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:54,460
Yeah, because this is a circle

1019
02:15:54,539 --> 02:16:02,479
Yeah, this this whole this whole corner is just a circle

1020
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:10,430
Is there a door here?

1021
02:16:10,430 --> 02:16:13,880
Or do I have to go down?

1022
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:15,880
Because this is actually just a circle

1023
02:16:16,119 --> 02:16:20,029
Oh, here we go. There's still a spot here

1024
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:24,319
I feel like I need to get in there

1025
02:16:24,319 --> 02:16:37,309
All right

1026
02:16:37,309 --> 02:16:39,309
Where is your phone?

1027
02:16:39,549 --> 02:17:02,000
Okay. Am I in your office?

1028
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:14,200
I don't think I am

1029
02:17:14,200 --> 02:17:35,959
What why did you do that? Jesus?

1030
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:58,729
What's your status?

1031
02:17:58,729 --> 02:18:03,850
Uh, well, I don't know somebody made a mistake is the status whatever that is

1032
02:18:04,329 --> 02:18:21,100
Okay

1033
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:22,139
Activate

1034
02:18:22,139 --> 02:18:25,450
All the doors are now open

1035
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:27,530
Oh that goes into that other room. Okay. I know what that is

1036
02:18:28,010 --> 02:18:38,239
Okay, I want to explore a little

1037
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:41,440
A little bit see if I can get some more stuff

1038
02:18:43,319 --> 02:18:44,280
Like this

1039
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:49,469
Okay, I got the full one. I'm gonna actually use that for a little while

1040
02:18:49,950 --> 02:18:55,129
What about this?

1041
02:18:55,129 --> 02:18:56,489
Ooh

1042
02:18:56,489 --> 02:19:41,799
It's turret time. I think I did it. How do I get out? So that takes care of that

1043
02:19:43,549 --> 02:19:58,170
Now I just to go back there and go in that room easy. Yeah. Well, just get a checkpoint anyways

1044
02:19:58,569 --> 02:20:04,840
Okay, this is back this way

1045
02:20:05,559 --> 02:20:07,799
There's one of the first doors back here

1046
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:10,719
All right

1047
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:18,969
What is this?

1048
02:20:18,969 --> 02:20:22,809
There it is and everybody's gone

1049
02:20:23,790 --> 02:20:26,430
I get the place to myself for the first time ever

1050
02:20:37,290 --> 02:20:52,030
That's hurry up music. I guess we're just gonna go

1051
02:21:02,379 --> 02:21:05,420
Why does it want me to go so fast? What does it want from me?

1052
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:23,850
um

1053
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:25,930
Faster, but why did it start here?

1054
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:30,680
Um move move move, but there's nowhere to go

1055
02:21:32,569 --> 02:21:34,569
It wants you to slide kick the bodies

1056
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:42,350
Oh, come on. Who heard that?

1057
02:21:42,829 --> 02:21:55,610
Is somebody up here? This has to be opened. Yeah, I think I can't do shit up here

1058
02:21:55,610 --> 02:22:15,020
I gotta go the other way. Holy fuck

1059
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:20,079
You lived

1060
02:22:33,229 --> 02:23:04,989
Wait, I thought he was a chair. Okay. Uh, nothing nothing nothing

1061
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:13,450
I don't hate anxiety music in games. It makes me feel like I I have to rush

1062
02:23:39,469 --> 02:23:49,420
Good not bad. Let's go now. We got new music

1063
02:23:49,819 --> 02:23:55,840
Why is the soundtrack just kicking in for the first time ever right now?

1064
02:24:15,319 --> 02:24:17,770
What?

1065
02:24:17,770 --> 02:24:18,889
Why

1066
02:24:18,889 --> 02:24:20,889
Why did he say that?

1067
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:27,790
Oh shit

1068
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:37,530
Wait, why is he why why did he move all this stuff?

1069
02:24:38,649 --> 02:24:43,129
The squad check it. That's some there's some problems in that troop

1070
02:24:46,879 --> 02:24:48,879
Shut your fucking mouth

1071
02:25:02,299 --> 02:25:04,440
Wait

1072
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:08,620
Where are they?

1073
02:25:08,620 --> 02:25:12,379
What the fuck are they using for a weapon? It's inside my head

1074
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,459
I it's inside my brain when they fire it. It's firing in my head

1075
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:05,850
I'm trying

1076
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:07,850
What was that noise?

1077
02:26:08,569 --> 02:26:14,940
That was the

1078
02:26:14,940 --> 02:26:17,100
That was an arcade, you know when you walk by the arcade

1079
02:26:18,170 --> 02:26:23,370
Do you want to know that sound that's the most the most quintessential arcade sound effect?

1080
02:26:23,930 --> 02:26:25,530
I'm gonna see if I can do it

1081
02:26:25,530 --> 02:26:30,809
You'll know exactly what I mean when I do this when you're walking by an arcade or there's an arcade near you or you're in an

1082
02:26:30,809 --> 02:26:32,809
Arcade and you hear this sound

1083
02:26:44,569 --> 02:26:47,370
That's the only sound that's the number one thing you pull from an arcade

1084
02:26:51,479 --> 02:26:53,479
And I don't even know what machine that is

1085
02:26:53,959 --> 02:27:01,920
I it's at every I don't know what it is. You just never know what that sound is

1086
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:03,920
But you know what it's there every time

1087
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:10,909
It's funny because i've never played a game of the arcade that made that sound

1088
02:27:12,489 --> 02:27:15,129
But i've heard it every time

1089
02:27:15,129 --> 02:27:16,969
Why?

1090
02:27:16,969 --> 02:27:18,969
Where should I go?

1091
02:27:18,969 --> 02:27:22,409
I wish I we just gotta I wish we just gotta shut the fuck up right there

1092
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,680
There's nobody here

1093
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,239
This this blood did he hit his head?

1094
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,040
Oh, he's over here now

1095
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:46,000
Oh shit

1096
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,979
He's

1097
02:27:47,979 --> 02:27:55,020
No, that's I want to do better than that the blind boomer

1098
02:27:59,739 --> 02:28:05,690
Why was there blood here?

1099
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:07,850
You understand there's blood

1100
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:11,500
I want whatever the gun they have I want it

1101
02:28:11,819 --> 02:28:14,510
What the fuck is this? It's a shotgun

1102
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,829
That's not that doesn't make any sense. That's impossible

1103
02:28:17,790 --> 02:28:28,219
What do you have for a gun?

1104
02:28:28,219 --> 02:28:30,219
So they were shooting from back here

1105
02:28:30,959 --> 02:28:32,399
like this

1106
02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:35,360
With a shotgun and it was like I was being sniped in the head

1107
02:28:37,530 --> 02:28:40,829
Cactus. Yep

1108
02:28:40,829 --> 02:28:42,270

1113
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:18,989

02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:39,920
I got his arm

1115
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:41,920
Somebody come on

1116
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:44,159
You gotta go through this

1117
02:29:44,239 --> 02:29:46,639

1118
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:52,239
without slo-mo

1119
02:29:52,239 --> 02:29:54,239
Just bang through the hole

1120
02:29:54,799 --> 02:29:59,389
He's not gonna move he's actually he's not going to move. He's not gonna move. He's not gonna move

1121
02:29:59,790 --> 02:30:44,750
Why are they getting so defensive now? They weren't they weren't doing this before

1122
02:30:55,579 --> 02:30:56,860
He's

1123
02:30:56,860 --> 02:30:58,540
It's not gonna help you

1124
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:00,540
It's it's a couch

1125
02:31:05,709 --> 02:31:07,709
Somebody back here does not want to take orders

1126
02:31:34,879 --> 02:31:36,879

He's just waiting for me. Oh my god. He's got a skeleton gun

1137
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:55,370

02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:59,129
I know this is kind of

1199
02:45:08,639 --> 02:45:10,639
What do you mean this sucks

1200
02:45:12,409 --> 02:45:16,889
One hell

1201
02:45:18,569 --> 02:45:33,760
What's going on what happened to the power, uh, I don't know what oh

1202
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:47,959
Hey, that was a late reaction

1203
02:45:55,790 --> 02:46:03,579
Okay, I did I turn it back on oh no, she's dead

1204
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:12,600
Can't open this soft line. We're just gonna move

1205
02:46:13,530 --> 02:46:35,370
Save it. Hmm. Hmm. Can I make it under definitely not going up?

1206
02:46:46,590 --> 02:46:48,590
I turned it off

1207
02:47:29,469 --> 02:47:48,420
What what the difference from last time

1208
02:48:03,930 --> 02:48:07,930
What's the difference between the last fucking first time that I did it

1209
02:48:09,530 --> 02:48:10,809
That's it

1210
02:48:10,809 --> 02:49:10,639
That motherfucker heard me stand up creaky knees apparently. Let's go. Let's go

1211
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:14,299
Did this game sorts code get leaked?

1212
02:49:16,600 --> 02:49:18,440
I don't know that's

1213
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:20,440
Dead hit that's kind of bad

1214
02:49:26,120 --> 02:49:41,850
Supply room. Damn it. It got leaked like this. The actual source code got leaked. That's kind of that's not good

1215
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:49,200
After it was released though

1216
02:49:56,729 --> 02:50:01,290
There you are. How did we get separated? How did you get out the power going out in the elevator?

1217
02:50:01,610 --> 02:50:04,889
Then the next thing I knew I was arriving on the top floor and you were gone

1218
02:50:05,610 --> 02:50:07,610
You should have a visual on the eback chopper

1219
02:50:07,850 --> 02:50:12,440
Great. Well

1220
02:50:16,079 --> 02:50:18,479
I am not waiting here. My dad's in danger

1221
02:50:23,020 --> 02:50:25,020
I

1222
02:50:25,979 --> 02:50:28,940
I'm laughing. I'm not laughing at the explosion. I'm laughing at the

1223
02:50:29,979 --> 02:50:31,020
shit

1224
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:33,340
Just okay. I need to I want to look this time

1225
02:50:43,899 --> 02:50:45,899
Well

1226
02:50:47,579 --> 02:50:49,579
What I thought it just exploded

1227
02:51:20,940 --> 02:51:31,020
No, right

1228
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:42,090
All right. Hold on that guy's so bloody

1229
02:51:42,729 --> 02:52:14,010
Where's the other guy?

1230
02:52:18,969 --> 02:52:37,299
What an idiot what a moron, all right, let's go i'm supposed to cut her off

1231
02:52:49,579 --> 02:52:53,729
Whatever flashlight

1232
02:53:06,750 --> 02:53:09,389
How did we have the same idea every time

1233
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:29,420
He fucking made it

1234
02:53:30,139 --> 02:53:31,500
Whoa

1235
02:53:31,500 --> 02:54:28,520
Pretty good. I have to cut her off. So I have to go down there. I think but there could be a health pack

1236
02:54:29,479 --> 02:54:31,479
And that's much more important to me

1237
02:54:34,120 --> 02:54:44,920
than game progress

1238
02:54:44,920 --> 02:54:46,680
Absolutely ridiculous

1239
02:54:46,680 --> 02:54:54,110
Which elevator this one? No. Oh, come on. I can't get in there

1240
02:54:54,750 --> 02:55:00,379
Let's just have to go down

1241
02:55:20,909 --> 02:55:23,870
This guy's voice change he's not he doesn't have the accent

1242
02:55:27,479 --> 02:55:30,360
He used to talk like this and he's like that's it not anymore

1243
02:55:31,159 --> 02:55:44,239
He just happens to have an accent

1244
02:55:44,239 --> 02:55:48,459
You you could have said something

1245
02:55:48,459 --> 02:55:51,340
Oh look another character that is unarmed

1246
02:55:52,360 --> 02:55:54,540
unarmored and surrounded by lanister swords

1247
02:55:58,430 --> 02:56:06,030
Come with me

1248
02:56:06,030 --> 02:56:09,709
I don't care as long as one person as long as one person gets that. I don't care

1249
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:31,920
Like two people will know what that is. I don't that's good for me. I don't care. It wasn't

1250
02:56:50,600 --> 02:56:58,170
Well, I thought you guys I thought better of you guys you didn't get it you didn't get it

1251
02:57:01,129 --> 02:57:12,440
Just didn't get it

1252
02:57:12,440 --> 02:57:38,250
Don't you know there are two ways to make everybody angry in chat make a rick and morty reference or say the word game of thrones

1253
02:57:38,809 --> 02:57:41,530
I think it's a guaranteed way to make everybody angry

1254
02:57:42,329 --> 02:57:52,250
Do a do a game of thrones reference and everybody will start screaming

1255
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:55,600
It's like the new rick and morty

1256
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:59,200
Remember like season one rick and morty everybody loved it and thought it was like a funny show

1257
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:05,180
And then they the show kept going and everyone was like, I hate that show game of thrones season one and two

1258
02:58:05,260 --> 02:58:08,059
Oh everybody, that's the best show on tv now. Everybody hates that show

1259
02:58:12,379 --> 02:58:15,579
It's weird. Yeah, that's it's very simple very simple process

1260
02:58:23,450 --> 02:58:48,809
Fucking master manipulator. Sorry. All right. I'm going over here master manipulator, but

1261
02:58:49,610 --> 02:58:52,090
Can't fucking follow simple directions

1262
02:58:53,879 --> 02:59:09,500
You know, we have our weaknesses

1263
02:59:10,540 --> 02:59:12,860
master manipulator as a

1264
02:59:12,860 --> 02:59:14,139
Fairly

1265
02:59:14,139 --> 02:59:17,739
Sore sense of direction as you see very clearly

1266
02:59:20,139 --> 02:59:23,979
Oh, but once I get out of here, I will put you in a scenario that

1267
02:59:25,239 --> 02:59:32,329
You'll be very upset that you got it and make you angry and maybe eventually if I could figure it out

1268
02:59:32,329 --> 02:59:35,370
I don't know how I even got in here in the first place. I don't fucking remember

1269
02:59:38,200 --> 02:59:40,200
I actually don't remember how I got in here

1270
02:59:48,079 --> 02:59:59,799
Found it. What's another one? What's another show or movie or something that everyone like really liked

1271
03:00:01,389 --> 03:00:06,729
And then everybody hates now. I'm trying to think

1272
03:00:10,920 --> 03:00:12,590
Dexter

1273
03:00:12,590 --> 03:00:14,809
Yeah, maybe

1274
03:00:14,809 --> 03:00:18,729
I guess the real moral of that story is if you don't want the word

1275
03:00:19,049 --> 03:00:23,850
Or if reference to your show to make everybody like puke in their mouths and hate everything about your show

1276
03:00:24,489 --> 03:00:27,690
Is to just only have five seasons ever of a television show

1277
03:00:29,159 --> 03:00:30,760
I think that's what it is

1278
03:00:30,760 --> 03:00:37,629
Think of every tv show that had that had like less than five seasons people remember it very fondly

1279
03:00:38,190 --> 03:00:52,489
Okay, let's go

1280
03:00:52,489 --> 03:00:54,920
Five is too many

1281
03:01:03,309 --> 03:01:05,709
House had eight seasons house did

1282
03:01:06,350 --> 03:01:10,520
Get a little weird at the last like two or three seasons though. You know what I mean?

1283
03:01:11,979 --> 03:01:15,180
I if house was five four or five seasons, I think it would have been fine

1284
03:01:15,819 --> 03:01:28,360
But then you were you run into a family guy scenario where family guy had like three or four seasons and everybody loves that

1285
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:33,399
Fucking those seasons best. Wow. That's the most that's the most funny the most hysterical show on television

1286
03:01:34,649 --> 03:01:39,290
Oh my god, I wish they would bring it back bring back family guy. It was so good everybody

1287
03:01:39,370 --> 03:01:44,489
Oh, it's my favorite fucking tv show. Please bring it back fox, please god

1288
03:01:44,569 --> 03:01:47,049
It's on adult swim now. Everybody loves this fucking show

1289
03:01:48,159 --> 03:01:56,799
And then they do 10 more seasons and now here we are everybody that everyone hates that show. It's it's weird how that happens

1290
03:02:00,329 --> 03:02:03,129
Because they went too long. They did it too long. They went too long

1291
03:02:10,719 --> 03:02:13,600
Simpsons was only good bad. Yeah, but here's the thing

1292
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:17,280
Like south park is still good

1293
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:28,940
What about that inch?

1294
03:02:28,940 --> 03:02:30,940
Now we're fighting robots. Okay

1295
03:02:36,040 --> 03:02:43,770
No, it isn't what?

1296
03:02:43,770 --> 03:02:47,850
I think south park is still doing like still making fun funny shit

1297
03:02:53,870 --> 03:02:58,350
Chat thinks nothing is good. Is that that's another thing too. Do you guys like anything?

1298
03:03:01,290 --> 03:03:04,250
Does anybody does anybody on twitch like anything?

1299
03:03:08,729 --> 03:03:11,850
I mean, I have a lot of things that I don't like but I feel like

1300
03:03:12,489 --> 03:03:14,649
Does anybody enjoy anything anymore?

1301
03:03:19,579 --> 03:03:26,840
Hold show that I already have that what's your favorite? What's your favorite tv show?

1302
03:03:29,610 --> 03:03:46,940
And don't say dream of that night five because we already know that one. Should I go in here? He took my answer

1303
03:03:47,020 --> 03:03:49,180
Wait, let me let me let me pay attention for one second

1304
03:03:49,899 --> 03:03:53,360
I want to make sure I don't miss any like heels or something

1305
03:03:57,280 --> 03:03:59,229
mash

1306
03:03:59,229 --> 03:04:07,549
All right. Yeah, it's

1307
03:04:07,549 --> 03:04:09,549
It's probably actually your stream

1308
03:04:10,360 --> 03:04:12,200
Well, thanks

1309
03:04:12,200 --> 03:04:16,350
uh

1310
03:04:16,350 --> 03:04:19,549
You know, i'm of the opinion we've got we've got like too much media now

1311
03:04:20,620 --> 03:04:21,979
It's like it's

1312
03:04:21,979 --> 03:04:23,979
With you could just open up netflix

1313
03:04:24,459 --> 03:04:26,780
And watch every television show ever

1314
03:04:30,959 --> 03:04:32,959
You got like netflix hulu

1315
03:04:33,770 --> 03:04:36,409
hbo now

1316
03:04:36,409 --> 03:04:39,690
You've got so many shows and so many movies

1317
03:04:42,159 --> 03:04:46,079
It used to be you had to wait until that shit was on cable television

1318
03:04:46,719 --> 03:04:49,040
once a week

1319
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:53,760
Now it's just every every two weeks. There's like five new netflix movies

1320
03:04:54,729 --> 03:04:56,729
Where the fuck do these come from?

1321
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:08,440
And they're all bad

1322
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:10,600
This is a 75 year old opinion

1323
03:05:11,959 --> 03:05:16,360
I don't think so. I it's just like there's this a lot. Hold on aliens

1324
03:05:17,319 --> 03:05:33,659
Can I turn those into a skeleton? That'd be cool

1325
03:05:36,040 --> 03:05:38,040
Everything's in color nowadays

1326
03:05:40,760 --> 03:05:48,219
No, there's a lot of options

1327
03:05:48,219 --> 03:05:50,219
Oh, yeah, do you see me?

1328
03:05:53,760 --> 03:06:00,920
He's too fast

1329
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:13,290
A minute it's making the arcade sound

1330
03:06:15,549 --> 03:06:19,389
Oh i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead in that scenario I gotta pull out the other gun

1331
03:06:20,110 --> 03:06:27,479
What was the last time I saved it?

1332
03:06:27,479 --> 03:06:29,239
Why am I all the way back here?

1333
03:06:29,239 --> 03:06:33,020
Are you serious?

1334
03:06:33,020 --> 03:06:44,729
Why are they aliens? No, it's not it's this way. I think they're just robot drone attack

1335
03:06:45,899 --> 03:06:47,500
things

1336
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:53,129
I didn't save

1337
03:06:53,129 --> 03:07:03,450
Sorry

1338
03:07:03,450 --> 03:07:05,530
Always sunny is actually hilarious. Yes, it is

1339
03:07:06,090 --> 03:07:08,270
I mean, there's definitely this this

1340
03:07:08,270 --> 03:07:10,270
There are shows that are still good

1341
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:12,250
You know what I mean?

1342
03:07:12,250 --> 03:07:16,680
It really does feel like if if everybody loves your show

1343
03:07:19,659 --> 03:07:23,260
More than five to eight years later. Everybody doesn't like your show

1344
03:07:23,819 --> 03:07:29,629
All right, here we go

1345
03:07:40,120 --> 03:07:42,360
That's why i'm telling you guys i'm i'm getting close

1346
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,879
I'm getting close to being over that like 10 year seasons

1347
03:07:48,239 --> 03:07:50,239
When are you guys gonna start hating this show?

1348
03:07:52,040 --> 03:07:54,040
I just didn't even get a chance

1349
03:07:57,209 --> 03:08:04,829
Was that one of the robots that just said that

1350
03:08:14,889 --> 03:08:29,370
Okay, save it here

1351
03:08:29,450 --> 03:08:35,209
Now really yeah, really when we already kind of had this conversation before about like, oh, yeah after spree it was just like come on

1352
03:08:38,190 --> 03:08:41,469
That's my favorite episode. It will always be my favorite episode

1353
03:08:51,659 --> 03:09:11,389
It was the helicopter

1354
03:09:11,389 --> 03:09:12,430
shit

1355
03:09:12,430 --> 03:09:17,229
I got plenty of heels

1356
03:09:17,229 --> 03:09:19,790
Uh, let's get a safe right here. I think that's a good idea

1357
03:09:20,350 --> 03:09:22,350
All right, let's go

1358
03:09:55,209 --> 03:10:01,040
You know, I had to do it. Okay

1359
03:10:06,600 --> 03:10:08,600
The word, uh

1360
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:09,639
Okay

1361
03:10:09,639 --> 03:10:11,319
No, all right

1362
03:10:11,319 --> 03:10:14,760

Grenade i'm gonna throw it. There's a lot of people over there this way

1439
03:22:32,379 --> 03:22:41,709
This game is epic

1440
03:22:41,709 --> 03:22:43,149
Yes, it is

1441
03:22:43,149 --> 03:22:51,709
You're right. It is

1442
03:22:51,709 --> 03:22:53,709
They don't even know

1443
03:23:11,770 --> 03:23:16,440
Nothing. Oh, hold on. What about the truck?

1444
03:23:20,590 --> 03:23:23,790
Ooh refills

1445
03:23:23,790 --> 03:23:29,950
I don't really need any of them. Um

1446
03:23:30,750 --> 03:23:33,549
Hold on

1447
03:23:33,549 --> 03:23:36,860

1449
03:23:38,299 --> 03:23:52,360

03:23:52,360 --> 03:24:05,840

1451
03:24:05,840 --> 03:24:07,280
How do I

1452
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:09,280
That's not gonna do anything man

1453
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:13,500
Holy shit. Is that how you stop getting hurt from a grenade?

1454
03:24:31,770 --> 03:24:33,770
I do not have any

1455
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:36,670
I'm gonna have to use the electric gun

1456
03:24:37,309 --> 03:24:55,209
See ya

1457
03:24:55,209 --> 03:25:04,809
That electric gun is pretty good

1458
03:25:04,889 --> 03:25:06,649
What did you have?

1459
03:25:06,649 --> 03:25:14,170
Don't want it

1460
03:25:14,170 --> 03:25:16,559
Dude, don't

1461
03:25:16,559 --> 03:25:18,559
Don't do that people

1462
03:25:24,520 --> 03:25:29,200
Good. I think i've made it to the top

1463
03:25:31,639 --> 03:25:39,319
Right. Damn it. No secret

1464
03:25:39,899 --> 03:25:40,620
I have to look at that

1465
03:25:40,620 --> 03:25:45,020
Well, hold on. I can't alt tab when I alt tab the game will crash if I don't do it in a very specific way

1466
03:25:45,180 --> 03:25:47,180
this way

1467
03:25:53,930 --> 03:25:59,770
Oh, I did it I did it

1468
03:26:11,690 --> 03:26:13,690
Why there

1469
03:26:14,430 --> 03:26:16,430
No car bus

1470
03:26:22,540 --> 03:26:45,399
I really thought we were that was we were gonna get out of there

1471
03:26:48,409 --> 03:26:49,530
You know what I mean?

1472
03:26:49,530 --> 03:26:52,729
It looks okay, but the pilot's dead and jen's banged up pretty bad

1473
03:26:54,440 --> 03:26:58,760
I'll live we're fine. It'll be a while before I can ice skate again. Yeah, we're fine. We have dialogue

1474
03:26:59,319 --> 03:27:05,000
You sure you want to send him alone? These guys ain't fucking around

1475
03:27:09,659 --> 03:27:15,360
By the time backup reaches you we're still a couple of clicks away from the ramama compound

1476
03:27:15,520 --> 03:27:17,520
So you're gonna have to get there on foot

1477
03:27:17,680 --> 03:27:32,399
Hope it's true. Oh, it's true

1478
03:27:32,399 --> 03:27:43,120
It's true

1479
03:27:43,120 --> 03:27:45,120
She'll be okay. It's you i'm worried about

1480
03:27:52,700 --> 03:27:54,700
Okay, let's go

1481
03:27:55,290 --> 03:27:56,729
Can't go in there

1482
03:27:56,729 --> 03:28:16,559
Can't go in here kind of a creepy place though. I thought that was a person folded in half

1483
03:28:17,959 --> 03:28:22,520
I looked over. I thought that was their legs in the shoes and that was their body like folded up

1484
03:28:23,559 --> 03:28:35,520
Okay, i'm getting condemned vibes from this place

1485
03:28:36,959 --> 03:28:38,959
That game is great

1486
03:28:38,959 --> 03:28:41,200
What a great game that was

1487
03:28:41,440 --> 03:28:55,709
You didn't finish the second one. I didn't I never finished the second one. Are you sure?

1488
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:01,000
Uh, yeah, I did

1489
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:13,770
Yeah, I did

1490
03:29:13,770 --> 03:29:15,770
I think he threw

1491
03:29:15,850 --> 03:29:45,260
Okay, I think the guy just stepped on his friend. All right, let's get the shotgun going

1492
03:29:48,829 --> 03:29:50,829
Stuff in this room probably

1493
03:30:01,319 --> 03:30:03,870
Both of them

1494
03:30:03,870 --> 03:30:05,549
Oh, I got them both

1495
03:30:05,549 --> 03:30:19,930
Is he dead? I think so

1496
03:30:20,090 --> 03:30:32,159
What am I looking for in here the enemy patrols?

1497
03:30:33,040 --> 03:30:37,950
I'm just walking

1498
03:30:37,950 --> 03:30:54,629
What is going on?

1499
03:30:54,629 --> 03:30:55,610
uninhabitable

1500
03:30:55,610 --> 03:31:04,620
Hello, is this guy dead?

1501
03:31:05,020 --> 03:31:41,579
No, okay itchy face itchy face. Not good lethal shoulder injury go through here this way

1502
03:31:43,510 --> 03:31:51,049
Uninhabitable, I can't get in. Come on. Really? So how do I get through here? I gotta go all the way around

1503
03:31:55,000 --> 03:31:57,000
Can I make it through here?

1504
03:31:57,079 --> 03:31:59,209
I mean I can

1505
03:31:59,209 --> 03:32:00,489
Not really

1506
03:32:00,489 --> 03:32:10,139
Should maybe go down the hole

1507
03:32:10,139 --> 03:32:12,940
Because I can go

1508
03:32:12,940 --> 03:32:14,940
What is that fucking explosion?

1509
03:32:18,959 --> 03:32:20,959
Oh, I do have to go down there. Okay

1510
03:32:21,530 --> 03:32:32,319
All right, I see the health pack

1511
03:32:32,319 --> 03:32:54,440
You idiot that might soft lock me. Oh my god. What are these guys? Seriously you motherfuckers?

1512
03:33:08,750 --> 03:33:10,809
great, all right

1513
03:33:10,809 --> 03:33:24,299
I could be

1514
03:33:24,299 --> 03:33:56,299
Guy was right here. Don't throw a grenade, please. He was good. He was gonna say it

1515
03:33:56,780 --> 03:34:01,020
He was gonna say it. I stopped him from saying it. He was supposed to say

1516
03:34:02,750 --> 03:34:21,000
Uh-oh

1517
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:33,790
Whatever it is. It's big

1518
03:34:33,790 --> 03:34:44,829
Oh dear

1519
03:34:44,829 --> 03:34:50,569
You all right. Oh my god, he can run through we can break through all the walls

1520
03:34:52,520 --> 03:35:37,629
Holy shit. I i'm gonna use this whole damn thing

1521
03:35:44,090 --> 03:35:46,969
Holy god. Oh

1522
03:35:47,129 --> 03:35:55,920
I only have five more shots out of this thing. It's like the most powerful gun in the game and that took so long

1523
03:35:57,309 --> 03:36:02,409
Holy shit. Okay

1524
03:36:02,409 --> 03:36:09,870
Well, maybe I can get out of here now. What did he destroy?

1525
03:36:10,889 --> 03:36:16,379
Wait a minute

1526
03:36:16,379 --> 03:36:18,620
Where is this? Okay. Now this is the right way

1527
03:36:19,260 --> 03:36:30,010
Watch there be two of those things. There's gonna be two of those things

1528
03:37:06,559 --> 03:37:20,829
What happened it's that motherfucker right there

1529
03:37:21,629 --> 03:37:34,620
I

1530
03:37:34,620 --> 03:37:36,620
Don't know what they were looking at there, but

1531
03:37:37,579 --> 03:37:38,940
It wasn't me

1532
03:37:38,940 --> 03:38:00,639
Where is he right there? Is that is that him? Is that the guy who the fuck it is?

1533
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:27,040
Well, they all have one

1534
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:30,079
I want I wish I'd be going that room and get all that ammo. That'd be great. All right

1535
03:38:30,079 --> 03:38:36,379
We have to make a jump here. Is that not where you go?

1536
03:38:45,799 --> 03:38:52,350
Um, is there a little thing maybe thing on the right because of that I think that's what I have to do

1537
03:38:55,020 --> 03:39:04,909
Just yeah, it's right there in the nova you got to stand on like the brick part sticking out

1538
03:39:17,819 --> 03:39:20,139
Oh fuck, whoa, he went the other way

1539
03:39:22,360 --> 03:39:25,719
God damn it. That sucks. Do I really have to restart this again?

1540
03:39:26,360 --> 03:39:36,559
I don't think I can't cross over here. So is it really just that simple?

1541
03:39:38,059 --> 03:39:40,059
No, it's not is it? I don't think I can do this

1542
03:39:42,649 --> 03:39:44,649
That looks like you stand there and jump to there

1543
03:39:47,319 --> 03:39:49,639
Is that don't admit that's maybe not what you're supposed to do

1544
03:39:53,629 --> 03:40:00,159
I don't think you're supposed to do that

1545
03:40:00,159 --> 03:40:10,959
But I did it. I got a lot of ammo for this thing

1546
03:40:20,719 --> 03:40:23,520
Okay, um, I need to start using that

1547
03:40:26,120 --> 03:40:32,959
I'm just target practice

1548
03:40:32,959 --> 03:40:34,079
Let's go

1549
03:40:34,079 --> 03:40:38,920
Who else is here?

1550
03:40:38,920 --> 03:40:40,700
Anybody else?

1551
03:40:40,700 --> 03:40:42,700
Oh, wow. Look at you

1552
03:40:42,700 --> 03:40:46,379
That's what I get for talking shit. I don't why am I talking?

1553
03:40:58,120 --> 03:41:18,559
Helpax no

1554
03:41:18,559 --> 03:41:19,600
All right, here we go

1555
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:54,139
Where's the southern guy? There's three of them and then there's another guy over here somewhere up on the roof. I think okay

1556
03:41:54,780 --> 03:42:06,250
Anybody else? Oh

1557
03:42:06,250 --> 03:42:32,040
Okay, that was a bad place to save the game, but it's okay save it right here. Nobody else, right?

1558
03:42:33,229 --> 03:42:35,389
Don't just pop out of the window and shoot me in the head, please

1559
03:42:41,530 --> 03:42:52,879
Yeah, what's one person? Oh, no, how scary? Why is this so scary?

1560
03:42:58,489 --> 03:43:04,559
That was they had they played specific music to be

1561
03:43:05,719 --> 03:43:20,329
Scared of that guy. He's what he's playing this on easy. This is on hard

1562
03:43:23,129 --> 03:43:45,200
What's with all the meat? I can't see shit in here. He flew up so fast

1563
03:43:45,920 --> 03:44:14,700
That the top of the door guillotined his head. That was fucked up. These are oh, give me that

1564
03:44:15,020 --> 03:44:17,420
These are the guys with the lightning the electric guns

1565
03:44:19,930 --> 03:44:22,409
That's pretty great. How much do I have now?

1566
03:44:23,030 --> 03:44:24,489
28

1567
03:44:24,489 --> 03:44:26,090
Nice, that's awesome

1568
03:44:26,090 --> 03:44:41,049
Where is he the fuck is he? Where is he?

1569
03:44:46,639 --> 03:44:48,639
I heard check it out. So where is he?

1570
03:44:58,409 --> 03:45:17,799
I'm gonna run right into him accidentally over here. He's over there. What what is he talking?

1571
03:45:21,290 --> 03:45:23,290
I thought he was talking

1572
03:45:24,250 --> 03:45:27,690
I was trying to listen to him. I thought he was having that conversation with the guy

1573
03:45:28,170 --> 03:45:30,809
He was a blackhawk helicopter crashed

1574
03:46:09,000 --> 03:46:11,000
There's a health thing in there

1575
03:46:11,079 --> 03:46:13,079
Is he alive?

1576
03:46:45,260 --> 03:47:03,579
Found him. He was outside on the side. This place sucks. All right, give me the uh upgrade

1577
03:47:06,979 --> 03:47:38,090
170 health seems pretty good. Doesn't it? Okay, let's go get in there. All right

1578
03:47:38,329 --> 03:47:48,989
Oh this she is the girl that drive drove off in her car. I should liquidate you right now

1579
03:47:49,069 --> 03:48:33,950
Wait, somebody behind you no flashlight somebody in here

1580
03:48:34,590 --> 03:48:36,590
What what happened? What happened?

1581
03:48:38,030 --> 03:48:51,790
What?

1582
03:48:57,760 --> 03:49:05,799
Dead

1583
03:49:05,799 --> 03:49:17,129
No, that was just a pot and a piece of cardboard no, not this

1584
03:49:26,840 --> 03:50:02,829
I took damage in my dream. That's bullshit. That does not that's not how it works damn. Yeah, I took damage in my dream

1585
03:50:03,069 --> 03:50:13,440
That's not how that you can't get hurt in your dreams. Yes, you can

1586
03:50:16,059 --> 03:50:20,860
Yeah, maybe if you like are having a dream about something and you like punch yourself in the face in the dream, maybe

1587
03:50:23,770 --> 03:50:28,809
If you like roll around and like roll out of bed and hit your head on your night table next to you then yeah

1588
03:50:35,690 --> 03:50:38,649
If you like sleepwalk making eggs and you put your hand in the pan

1589
03:50:40,219 --> 03:50:50,059
Yeah

1590
03:50:50,059 --> 03:50:51,579
I don't want to go that way

1591
03:50:51,579 --> 03:51:08,030
Wait, there might be a health back in here. What the hell was that?

1592
03:51:08,829 --> 03:51:10,510
Give him back

1593
03:51:10,510 --> 03:51:17,790
That is the exact tv that I used to hide under my blanket and watch wwf wrestling when I was younger

1594
03:51:18,350 --> 03:51:20,110
the exact television

1595
03:51:20,110 --> 03:51:48,559
That's not the right gun. All right, let's move now

1596
03:51:57,629 --> 03:52:05,239
Why do they do that every time

1597
03:52:05,399 --> 03:52:08,520
It's almost like they the game knows when I press the grenade button

1598
03:52:25,549 --> 03:52:27,549
Not this time

1599
03:52:33,309 --> 03:52:35,309
That's fucking ridiculous

1600
03:52:36,239 --> 03:52:41,290
Oh

1601
03:52:41,290 --> 03:52:44,879
Okay, let me slow down

1602
03:52:44,959 --> 03:52:48,110
this in my brain

1603
03:52:48,110 --> 03:52:51,120
There was no

1604
03:52:51,180 --> 03:52:55,200
Possible fucking way that there was going to be another person inside of that truck

1605
03:53:02,700 --> 03:53:09,479
Impossible. Oh, no, I can't get in

1606
03:53:18,159 --> 03:53:25,850
Checkpoint good two health packs. What are you preparing me for?

1607
03:53:26,809 --> 03:53:29,559
What are you preparing me for?

1608
03:53:47,149 --> 03:53:53,020
It's important, let's I just want to see if it's possible to get hit by

1609
03:53:55,659 --> 03:54:11,920
Okay, so I needed to make sure I didn't want to see if it was possible did I just drop that

1610
03:54:12,559 --> 03:54:33,340
Does anybody know what happened?

1611
03:54:34,940 --> 03:54:36,940
I'm camping

1612
03:54:37,659 --> 03:54:40,860
Spawn camping of spawn camp

1613
03:54:41,420 --> 03:54:43,420
Uh

1614
03:54:53,149 --> 03:54:56,129
Who the fuck are you oh that's so funny

1615
03:55:06,170 --> 03:55:15,659
What the fuck hello idiot

1616
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:21,040
Uh-oh, it's like a it's one of those

1617
03:55:23,229 --> 03:55:29,879
Okay

1618
03:55:32,219 --> 03:55:36,459
Spawn killing. Oh, it's gonna make me laugh every fucking time

1619
03:55:51,049 --> 03:56:08,000
Oh, okay, I would laugh if they just kept spawning

1620
03:56:12,170 --> 03:56:14,569
Like why wouldn't they be able to get out

1621
03:56:20,200 --> 03:56:24,520
To just hold just hold down left mouse button one of you will kill me

1622
03:56:27,870 --> 03:56:31,969
Even when there's a hacker. Oh, you can just hold left mouse button out the door

1623
03:56:36,889 --> 03:56:50,760
Uh

1624
03:56:50,760 --> 03:56:52,760
There's more in there now

1625
03:56:59,739 --> 03:57:09,659
Were there four in there last time?

1626
03:57:31,159 --> 03:57:37,899
Okay, that's that I want to be like in that perspective

1627
03:57:38,989 --> 03:57:41,790
I've been in that perspective before that perspective is just a guy

1628
03:57:42,430 --> 03:57:43,709
going

1629
03:57:43,709 --> 03:57:48,989
Speed hacking back and forth and just holding down the mouse button that auto aims to your head

1630
03:57:49,790 --> 03:57:51,790
And all of us just like oh, no

1631
03:57:52,510 --> 03:57:59,069
Hold on wait, wait, just pocket medic me uber me uber me. We'll get out. We'll get out just just everybody took five medics

1632
03:57:59,870 --> 03:58:05,100
I know what that's like

1633
03:58:05,100 --> 03:58:51,600
It was bullshit. All right, I got full armor. I don't want it something's about to happen here. So i'm gonna

1634
03:58:52,239 --> 03:58:56,459
I don't know. So i'm just gonna bust through

1635
03:58:57,180 --> 03:59:01,100
Yeah, look at all these health packs. They're giving me this is gonna be fight against something

1636
03:59:02,459 --> 03:59:03,899
through here

1637
03:59:03,899 --> 03:59:06,329
No, really?

1638
03:59:06,329 --> 03:59:09,440
i'm surprised

1639
03:59:09,440 --> 03:59:32,190
Oh, right. Okay, we're going over the fence. You can't jump it

1640
03:59:33,340 --> 03:59:37,549
There's a door right here

1641
03:59:37,549 --> 03:59:39,549
It's the revenge of the

1642
03:59:50,090 --> 03:59:52,120
Where is it going?

1643
03:59:52,120 --> 03:59:53,479
Where is it going?

1644
03:59:53,479 --> 04:00:05,629
backing up

1645
04:00:05,629 --> 04:00:09,100
You still alive

1646
04:00:09,100 --> 04:00:11,100
I think that guy fell in the window

1647
04:00:13,959 --> 04:00:15,959
Yeah, I think I didn't know what the fuck he was doing

1648
04:00:16,440 --> 04:00:47,579
Checked the back of that car. I was too focused on that guy

1649
04:01:04,440 --> 04:01:14,719
Anything else? No

1650
04:01:14,719 --> 04:01:18,079
Largest concentration. This is gonna be fun. Now, isn't it?

1651
04:01:29,840 --> 04:01:31,280
scaffoldings

1652
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:55,739
Okay, nothing down here. It's not I don't get to be a badass like I was told

1653
04:01:56,540 --> 04:02:00,649
Save it here

1654
04:02:00,649 --> 04:02:04,489
Uh, I need to use the bathroom. I've got to use the bathroom. I gotta pee

1655
04:02:05,739 --> 04:02:08,219
So let me say let me get in a spot on the corner here

1656
04:02:09,340 --> 04:02:15,239
I'll be right back. I have to use the bathroom in game. No, like in real life

1657
04:02:15,959 --> 04:04:49,739
I'll be right back

1658
04:04:49,739 --> 04:04:54,479
All right

1659
04:04:54,559 --> 04:04:57,600
I have returned

1660
04:05:05,209 --> 04:05:13,879
Hello, so I feel like we're getting to the uh

1661
04:05:15,690 --> 04:05:19,850
The last leg of a game if I were to take a guess I would say this is probably it

1662
04:05:24,040 --> 04:05:26,040
Eliminate enemy patrols

1663
04:05:26,459 --> 04:05:39,239
This is another sniper section

1664
04:05:39,239 --> 04:05:42,409
Oh, no another fucking car

1665
04:06:00,959 --> 04:06:09,239
It was a whole squad in there. They were ready. They're sitting in the back. Let's go. We're gonna do it

1666
04:06:09,559 --> 04:06:11,559
We're gonna kill this motherfucker

1667
04:06:13,659 --> 04:06:15,579
I don't know what the driver

1668
04:06:15,579 --> 04:06:17,469
Is doing

1669
04:06:17,469 --> 04:06:18,430
Why?

1670
04:06:18,430 --> 04:06:25,420
Would you do that?

1671
04:06:25,420 --> 04:06:27,420
It's like hey, uh

1672
04:06:27,420 --> 04:06:29,899
That tom tom he's right there

1673
04:06:30,909 --> 04:06:34,989
Tom you're still going tom. You're going over the cliff

1674
04:07:00,459 --> 04:07:10,090
Okay, he knows we're fighting. You know what? I've noticed a lot more in this part of the game here

1675
04:07:10,969 --> 04:07:12,969
Not a whole lot of enemy talking

1676
04:07:14,409 --> 04:07:15,850
I think they're

1677
04:07:15,850 --> 04:07:19,719
I think they're trying to focus

1678
04:07:19,719 --> 04:07:23,930
Well, two can play at that game. I just won't talk either

1679
04:07:35,979 --> 04:07:47,530
Uh, never mind they're talking

1680
04:07:47,530 --> 04:07:49,190
That is

1681
04:07:49,190 --> 04:07:52,250
Unbelievable that he still was able to get that off

1682
04:07:52,569 --> 04:07:54,729
He got 10

1683
04:07:54,729 --> 04:08:02,649
Seven or eight bullets in his arm and his body and he still pulled it off his angle even changed

1684
04:08:03,049 --> 04:08:53,979
What happened? Oh, there was a tank right there. Nice. He's still left by the legs

1685
04:08:54,620 --> 04:08:59,899
All right. I gotta get up. Hold on check check check check check check

1686
04:09:00,620 --> 04:09:02,600
Check we're good

1687
04:09:02,600 --> 04:09:03,559
check

1688
04:09:03,639 --> 04:09:07,479
Get up one health back

1689
04:09:20,510 --> 04:09:22,510
Did he just dodge it

1690
04:09:23,159 --> 04:09:28,219
He went like this

1691
04:09:28,219 --> 04:09:36,860
Holy shit, man

1692
04:09:36,860 --> 04:09:40,299
I can't what I go from here. I gotta jump from here to there

1693
04:09:41,959 --> 04:09:44,760
Okay, I have to jump. No, I don't it's right here

1694
04:09:52,569 --> 04:09:54,569
The health upgrade. Yeah, I know i'll get it

1695
04:09:54,729 --> 04:09:59,209
I think I have to go around for the health upgrade like this

1696
04:09:59,930 --> 04:10:03,440
Can I see?

1697
04:10:03,440 --> 04:10:05,440
Well, it's not a health upgrade but

1698
04:10:05,959 --> 04:10:11,290
still good

1699
04:10:11,370 --> 04:10:23,899
Uh, I do want to go up here and see if there's anything over here though. We'll check there is

1700
04:10:26,799 --> 04:10:29,920
Body armor is nice, but I don't really this doesn't open right now

1701
04:10:35,899 --> 04:10:39,739
Nothing no fall damage, right?

1702
04:10:44,670 --> 04:10:57,360
Let's go

1703
04:10:57,360 --> 04:10:59,360
Down or around probably around first

1704
04:10:59,440 --> 04:11:07,870
Spawn camp are they just sitting in there waiting for me to do something?

1705
04:11:14,959 --> 04:11:16,959
All right. I'm gonna surround

1706
04:11:16,959 --> 04:11:19,520
I'm gonna surround the uh outside with stickies

1707
04:11:20,159 --> 04:11:22,159
And the second I see the door open to right click

1708
04:11:23,979 --> 04:11:27,979
And then watch the chat room and watch everybody in that spawn

1709
04:11:28,700 --> 04:11:30,700
Talk about how much of a piece of shit I am

1710
04:11:31,420 --> 04:11:38,010
That's gonna open right?

1711
04:11:38,010 --> 04:11:43,370
All right. I'm taking a gamble that this is going to open. That's just a gamble. I'm just i'm playing the odds

1712
04:11:44,090 --> 04:11:54,600
Okay, i'm just playing odds. I can pick them up if it doesn't happen. There's also a health upgrade over there. I think

1713
04:11:55,319 --> 04:12:10,250
Okay, so you can open

1714
04:12:10,250 --> 04:12:15,450
It might it actually might they might have to turn something on and all of a sudden boom it opens

1715
04:12:20,799 --> 04:12:27,879
Doesn't look like it that happens though. Just

1716
04:12:30,299 --> 04:12:40,719
Know that I was thinking about it. Let's make this smart

1717
04:13:08,510 --> 04:13:34,489
Wait, wait, don't do it yet. He's almost here. You're not gonna. Why do you guys always do this? Oh

1718
04:13:39,690 --> 04:14:06,559
You all right. You're actually pretty smart. Everyone else is stupid. Never mind. You're all idiots. You're idiots. So

1719
04:14:14,920 --> 04:14:16,920
No, not you guys. I'm no

1720
04:14:18,200 --> 04:14:23,420
I'll put words in my mouth. That's not what I said

1721
04:14:24,059 --> 04:14:29,520
It's not what I said. I mean it is what I said but I wasn't referring I was referring to these

1722
04:14:30,399 --> 04:14:31,600
These idiots

1723
04:14:31,600 --> 04:14:35,319
Okay, let's save it here

1724
04:14:35,319 --> 04:14:40,239
Somebody's mad in that room

1725
04:14:40,239 --> 04:14:53,209
Can I get him to come out?

1726
04:15:04,399 --> 04:15:30,299
Is he stuck? I think he's stuck in the wall. Um, I can't open the door

1727
04:15:31,020 --> 04:15:40,110
Well, I don't think I have to worry about that guy anymore

1728
04:15:43,629 --> 04:15:49,559
Okay, I heard a grunt and that

1729
04:15:50,520 --> 04:15:59,690
There was a loud grunt and then he stopped moving and his leg was sticking out of the wall

1730
04:16:09,850 --> 04:16:12,350
Wait, that's not you, is it?

1731
04:16:30,760 --> 04:16:41,920
You guys are the worst all right back to the shotgun

1732
04:16:45,840 --> 04:16:54,600
Mama. Oh, he didn't get stuck. He just walked back behind this way

1733
04:16:56,440 --> 04:16:58,440
And he walked the whole time

1734
04:17:04,239 --> 04:17:11,260
He walked a long way a very long way

1735
04:17:12,059 --> 04:17:15,389
It was actually in my favor though

1736
04:17:22,360 --> 04:17:23,639
I'm gonna use it

1737
04:17:23,639 --> 04:17:28,569
I need some big heavy weapons

1738
04:17:28,649 --> 04:17:31,920
There's a lot of those big guys now

1739
04:17:32,399 --> 04:17:34,159
So i'm gonna use it

1740
04:17:34,159 --> 04:17:35,680
on the big guys

1741
04:17:35,680 --> 04:17:42,590
Okay, this is

1742
04:17:44,540 --> 04:17:47,069
She's close now

1743
04:17:47,069 --> 04:17:50,670
Presence is strong here. Thanks for the info

1744
04:17:51,309 --> 04:18:03,870
nothing down

1745
04:18:03,870 --> 04:18:07,469
Who touched wait a heavy? No, i'm i'm just talking like straight up

1746
04:18:08,190 --> 04:18:09,709
like heavy

1747
04:18:09,709 --> 04:18:11,709
like a heavy gun

1748
04:18:11,709 --> 04:18:16,270
Like heavy weapons not the heavy weapons guy. Well, I mean a heavy weapons guy uses heavy weapons

1749
04:18:26,250 --> 04:18:28,559
Really?

1750
04:18:29,610 --> 04:18:32,809
What the fuck that guy's not it's so accurate with these

1751
04:18:33,610 --> 04:18:48,969
How is that guy not dead?

1752
04:18:48,969 --> 04:18:50,090
Okay

1753
04:18:50,090 --> 04:18:52,809
I need someone to explain how that guy's alive

1754
04:18:53,850 --> 04:18:58,250
I need someone to tell me what happened and why uh, where is he now?

1755
04:19:04,940 --> 04:19:06,940
He didn't but I shot him with

1756
04:19:07,579 --> 04:19:24,280
I killed him. What the fuck does he have for a gun?

1757
04:19:25,079 --> 04:19:28,200
Hold on. Okay. He has a repeating cannon

1758
04:19:31,020 --> 04:19:35,500
So these guys are much they're they're much harder. All right, I gotta bring out the real thing here

1759
04:19:38,479 --> 04:19:43,280
He's that's not gonna hit me. It's not gonna hit me. You're in a room by yourself

1760
04:19:52,649 --> 04:19:54,329
Oh, no your leg

1761
04:19:54,329 --> 04:19:59,290
Your leg is hurt

1762
04:19:59,290 --> 04:20:12,860
All right this thing look at this. I love what we dove out of the way too. Okay, let's check it

1763
04:20:12,940 --> 04:20:17,260
Is this thing gonna be good?

1764
04:20:17,260 --> 04:20:19,079
We'll try it

1765
04:20:19,079 --> 04:20:24,270
Repeating cannon nice. Okay, that gave me a lot of ammo for this

1766
04:20:27,629 --> 04:20:43,000
Very cool. Let's let's shoot somebody with this and see what happens good

1767
04:20:43,959 --> 04:20:49,500
Good up the ladder. This is the best weapon in the game

1768
04:20:51,799 --> 04:20:53,719
Uh, I wonder what it does

1769
04:20:53,719 --> 04:20:57,770
I'm looking forward to shooting my first person directly at the chest

1770
04:20:58,409 --> 04:21:07,200
This is where uh the little door that I couldn't go through earlier

1771
04:21:07,840 --> 04:21:21,219
Patrol

1772
04:21:25,299 --> 04:21:27,299
In more ways than one I think

1773
04:21:27,940 --> 04:21:31,579
Okay, I need that bad

1774
04:21:31,659 --> 04:21:36,719
Uh, do I have shark? Yeah, I got plenty of shark

1775
04:21:40,479 --> 04:21:44,110
It's very funny

1776
04:21:44,110 --> 04:21:47,309
I mean i'm just i'm just i'm just saying

1777
04:21:47,950 --> 04:21:51,409
I mean i'm just saying

1778
04:21:51,409 --> 04:22:03,090
Do I have any regular? Okay. I got a lot of regular grenades

1779
04:22:03,969 --> 04:22:19,409
It's a little too quiet

1780
04:22:19,409 --> 04:22:21,409
I knew it was quiet

1781
04:22:29,709 --> 04:22:50,030
I don't like that outcome. That's better

1782
04:23:10,290 --> 04:23:13,920
Okay, I actually like the shotgun for this better

1783
04:23:14,879 --> 04:23:27,870
Where is he?

1784
04:23:27,870 --> 04:23:35,100
There he is

1785
04:23:35,100 --> 04:23:37,739
Default shotgun is just the best weapon

1786
04:23:39,020 --> 04:23:41,649
No matter what scenario

1787
04:23:41,729 --> 04:23:53,059
It's just the best

1788
04:23:53,540 --> 04:24:00,000
That was a good face plant on the corner

1789
04:24:00,319 --> 04:24:16,450
All right. All right. All right

1790
04:24:17,760 --> 04:24:21,040
Where is he?

1791
04:24:21,040 --> 04:24:22,719
No, I think that's it

1792
04:24:22,719 --> 04:25:53,569
Nice work get banned for grenade spam. Keep at it. Keep at it. Keep at it. I'm coming. I'm coming

1793
04:25:53,969 --> 04:26:36,739
Is

1794
04:26:36,739 --> 04:26:45,629
Why did he go back? Come on. Come on. Come on

1795
04:26:47,229 --> 04:26:49,229
Come on, come on. Come on. Come on this way

1796
04:26:51,299 --> 04:26:53,940
Don't de aggro to your original spot. Yeah

1797
04:26:57,420 --> 04:27:00,540
I need that. I need you to step on that. I need this

1798
04:27:03,739 --> 04:27:17,700
Okay, i'm getting high ground here

1799
04:27:19,809 --> 04:27:45,329
Oh fuck

1800
04:27:45,329 --> 04:28:07,329
God damn it hit me right in the face. Now what you cheesed him?

1801
04:28:07,889 --> 04:28:11,409
How else are you supposed to kill those guys without cheesing them? That's the whole point

1802
04:28:12,500 --> 04:28:17,459
The entire point is to cheese that because it that it's impossible you you have to have to cheese that

1803
04:28:53,280 --> 04:28:58,139
Got it. That's probably a third one, too

1804
04:28:58,620 --> 04:29:03,620
I thought that was a gun. It's an arm

1805
04:29:05,709 --> 04:29:07,709
And I thought that was a frying pan

1806
04:29:07,709 --> 04:29:11,870
But it's a tire with a thing sticking out of it. I wasn't even gonna say anything, but I guess I just did

1807
04:29:19,409 --> 04:29:21,409
No healing sticks

1808
04:29:22,510 --> 04:29:24,510
This is the guy that beat yeah

1809
04:29:26,610 --> 04:29:29,569
I beat dark souls 3 on stream and i'm incredibly proud of it

1810
04:29:30,610 --> 04:29:32,290
and the dlc

1811
04:29:32,290 --> 04:29:43,760
That's not even an achievement anymore. He's here

1812
04:29:45,280 --> 04:29:47,280
Like I want to hear that conversation

1813
04:29:50,399 --> 04:29:58,850
I didn't know they were behind me at this point. It's okay. I want to hear that whole conversation

1814
04:30:12,780 --> 04:30:14,940
That's unbelievable how the fuck

1815
04:30:16,290 --> 04:30:18,290
Would you even rip around?

1816
04:30:26,399 --> 04:30:36,020
Yeah, okay. Yep. Come on out. Everything's fine. We got him that fucker's dead

1817
04:30:36,579 --> 04:30:55,569
Shoot him this way. Okay, it's time to just use my tried and true

1818
04:31:12,719 --> 04:31:14,719
He's here

1819
04:31:14,799 --> 04:31:33,360
He's talking to me like actually me or

1820
04:31:49,840 --> 04:31:52,319
I mean if i'm in that scenario and this super like

1821
04:31:53,600 --> 04:31:56,879
He's like sprinting around speed hacking and then just i'm gonna be like hey man

1822
04:31:57,840 --> 04:32:00,979
nice

1823
04:32:00,979 --> 04:32:02,979
What are you doing later? You want to like hang out?

1824
04:32:03,469 --> 04:32:06,590
I I guess I don't uh, no you did it good work

1825
04:32:07,149 --> 04:32:08,510
We're gonna do

1826
04:32:08,510 --> 04:32:12,879
And then when he and then be like, yeah, nice job when he's not looking

1827
04:32:15,299 --> 04:32:31,819
And then be like I did it. Where do I go? Oh if I have to touch what the hell is that what?

1828
04:32:36,829 --> 04:32:41,569
Okay

1829
04:32:41,569 --> 04:32:43,569
I guess you have this

1830
04:32:43,969 --> 04:33:28,000
Whole area back here. I don't have any at full health. So that's good. What is this attached to?

1831
04:33:28,560 --> 04:33:41,279
I get um

1832
04:33:48,220 --> 04:33:50,500
Kick some ass. Okay

1833
04:33:50,500 --> 04:33:52,580
Uh, so we can go down here

1834
04:33:53,299 --> 04:33:58,029
I was just in here. Oh, wait

1835
04:33:58,669 --> 04:34:03,939
I didn't look at this

1836
04:34:03,939 --> 04:34:08,020
No

1837
04:34:08,020 --> 04:34:12,659
I guess I don't need to do anything there. What about through here? It's like an elevator up there or something

1838
04:34:17,360 --> 04:34:19,360
Is this two skylights?

1839
04:34:19,840 --> 04:34:22,590
That just leads to this one

1840
04:34:22,590 --> 04:34:27,330
I'm getting nerd neck. Am I?

1841
04:34:27,490 --> 04:34:33,380
I feel like I have to do something with this

1842
04:34:38,209 --> 04:34:43,310
Can't like drop it

1843
04:34:43,310 --> 04:34:45,310
Obviously I have to get up there

1844
04:34:46,659 --> 04:34:48,659
Question is how?

1845
04:34:49,060 --> 04:34:52,590
Why can't I open?

1846
04:34:52,590 --> 04:34:54,590
This door didn't open last time

1847
04:34:55,619 --> 04:34:58,380
Why is it open now?

1848
04:34:58,380 --> 04:35:03,419
I I hope I tried to open it. I pressed I did you can go back and look. I really did. I promise

1849
04:35:06,209 --> 04:35:08,209
I did I really did

1850
04:35:15,040 --> 04:35:20,659
All right, let's go left

1851
04:35:20,659 --> 04:35:22,500
health upgrade

1852
04:35:22,500 --> 04:35:24,020
Yeah

1853
04:35:24,020 --> 04:35:25,540
175

1854
04:35:25,540 --> 04:35:34,979
What do I sound scared?

1855
04:35:34,979 --> 04:35:37,139
Um, i'm not scared. Um

1856
04:35:39,220 --> 04:35:42,900
Well, i'm a little i'm a little flush and queasy

1857
04:35:43,619 --> 04:35:45,459
But that's for other reasons

1858
04:35:45,459 --> 04:35:49,360
Did I just fall?

1859
04:35:49,360 --> 04:36:04,020
Who was that?

1860
04:36:04,020 --> 04:36:04,900
Uh

1861
04:36:04,900 --> 04:36:06,259
Here we go again

1862
04:36:06,259 --> 04:36:44,819
Hey, okay. I'm alive

1863
04:36:46,610 --> 04:36:49,009
And did I I didn't even go anywhere

1864
04:36:49,729 --> 04:37:00,720
Cool. You wasted ammo

1865
04:37:00,720 --> 04:37:02,720
Well, I they would have killed me

1866
04:37:13,599 --> 04:37:27,630
Thank you

1867
04:37:27,630 --> 04:37:35,889
incursion

1868
04:37:35,889 --> 04:37:37,889
locate ah

1869
04:37:40,110 --> 04:37:41,310
locate

1870
04:37:41,310 --> 04:37:44,700
wait

1871
04:37:44,700 --> 04:38:00,900
That didn't do anything

1872
04:38:00,900 --> 04:38:04,610
Dead dead

1873
04:38:04,610 --> 04:38:17,409
I'm glad you regenerate

1874
04:38:17,409 --> 04:38:21,340
To at least 25 that would be so

1875
04:38:22,930 --> 04:38:25,729
Awful if you didn't buy this on hard. It really doesn't matter

1876
04:38:27,599 --> 04:38:30,560
Because if you get shot like two or three times on hard you just die

1877
04:38:31,279 --> 04:38:36,900
So maybe that doesn't matter. That's no that's not an alarm, right?

1878
04:38:53,150 --> 04:38:55,150
Wait, just check the like health packs

1879
04:38:56,080 --> 04:38:58,319
I don't I I am in

1880
04:38:58,959 --> 04:39:00,959
The market for them. Here we are

1881
04:39:02,240 --> 04:39:05,360
And go that way

1882
04:39:05,360 --> 04:39:06,959
And go up here

1883
04:39:06,959 --> 04:39:12,580
Nothing. Okay

1884
04:39:12,580 --> 04:39:25,729
Let's check over this way

1885
04:39:25,729 --> 04:39:27,250
Multiple ways to go

1886
04:39:27,250 --> 04:39:34,209
I'm just gonna go through the vent

1887
04:39:34,209 --> 04:39:37,090
Oh, what are the oh nice. I haven't had these in a long time

1888
04:39:37,810 --> 04:39:43,569
I can't all right. Can I break this one?

1889
04:39:44,689 --> 04:39:47,599
I can't go through this

1890
04:39:47,599 --> 04:39:57,759
All right, let's just two grenades fine

1891
04:39:57,759 --> 04:40:03,840
Okay, let's go down

1892
04:40:04,319 --> 04:40:10,590
I don't think there's much else for me to do here

1893
04:40:20,369 --> 04:40:29,970
Still no health

1894
04:40:29,970 --> 04:40:45,900
Wait hidden. Nope. Hi guys

1895
04:40:48,700 --> 04:40:50,700
It's the last thing you're ever gonna say

1896
04:41:22,540 --> 04:41:29,740
Are you it's it's uh, it's garfield's human garfield

1897
04:41:40,159 --> 04:41:42,159
Do I get to kill human garfield now?

1898
04:41:42,819 --> 04:41:45,250
I really hope I do

1899
04:41:45,250 --> 04:41:46,290
Hey

1900
04:41:46,290 --> 04:41:48,500
Remember me

1901
04:41:48,500 --> 04:41:50,500
I'm coming for you

1902
04:41:51,060 --> 04:41:53,220
You don't have very much time remaining

1903
04:41:53,779 --> 04:42:30,419
That sucks. Let's go. I'm gonna pull out. What am I gonna do? Yeah. No. Yeah

1904
04:42:31,139 --> 04:42:35,919
It's part of the best. Let's do it

1905
04:42:54,099 --> 04:43:05,869
Best gun in the game that I do under the power of one guy

1906
04:43:07,409 --> 04:43:10,060
One guy

1907
04:43:10,060 --> 04:43:22,180
Can seriously change everything that's right attack me during a cutscene fucking coward

1908
04:43:22,900 --> 04:43:29,380
Coward attacks me during war coward. He's peeking around the side

1909
04:43:34,720 --> 04:43:39,729
Yeah, and now i'm gonna i'm gonna make your life a living hell. I'm killing you with the scary gun

1910
04:44:23,099 --> 04:44:26,220
Yeah, that is that is I was gonna say the same thing. He took the words right out of my mouth

1911
04:44:26,939 --> 04:44:28,939
That's really fucked up. Okay

1912
04:44:29,180 --> 04:44:34,060
Let's go up

1913
04:44:34,060 --> 04:44:53,139
Go up and can I crawl over?

1914
04:44:53,380 --> 04:44:56,000
I think I can crawl over the whole thing

1915
04:44:58,270 --> 04:45:00,270
Oh, that's sick. Nice

1916
04:45:00,349 --> 04:45:05,020
All right

1917
04:45:05,020 --> 04:45:10,580
I'm gonna drop in on him

1918
04:45:10,639 --> 04:45:30,110
Spider-man meets fear. Why would it be spider-man? He's not in here again

1919
04:45:32,139 --> 04:45:34,540
When is the final confrontation gonna be with this guy?

1920
04:45:35,619 --> 04:45:37,779
He keeps just barely getting away

1921
04:45:39,680 --> 04:46:05,630
Come on. I mean i'm gonna do what i'm gonna do. It's me. It's my life

1922
04:46:06,349 --> 04:46:08,349
so i'm gonna decide what I

1923
04:46:09,150 --> 04:46:13,790
I decided to shoot that guy because he was he was dangerous to me

1924
04:46:14,430 --> 04:46:30,990
These are all explosive

1925
04:46:44,340 --> 04:46:47,150
Yes

1926
04:46:47,150 --> 04:46:49,150
All right full health pretty much

1927
04:46:49,389 --> 04:46:51,330
That's all I need

1928
04:46:51,330 --> 04:46:55,490
Just like my father when we used to play

1929
04:46:55,970 --> 04:46:57,740
mario brothers

1930
04:46:57,740 --> 04:46:59,340
see my dad

1931
04:46:59,340 --> 04:47:03,900
was not like necessarily really great at video games, but we had the regular nintendo

1932
04:47:05,409 --> 04:47:06,529
and

1933
04:47:06,529 --> 04:47:10,689
What he would tell us to do we had regular just super mario brothers, right?

1934
04:47:11,330 --> 04:47:14,290
And he would tell us if we got him to the last level

1935
04:47:15,009 --> 04:47:17,009
with five lives

1936
04:47:17,169 --> 04:47:19,409
That he would beat the game for us because we couldn't do it

1937
04:47:20,560 --> 04:47:26,080
So we would always just try to get to the end and get have five lives and hand and be like dad

1938
04:47:26,479 --> 04:47:29,919
Dad, you have to beat the game. We got five lives at bowser's castle

1939
04:47:30,799 --> 04:47:35,409
And he'd come over be like, all right, excuse me. Let me sit down and he would do it every time

1940
04:47:36,290 --> 04:47:41,090
But we had to have five lives though because there was a couple places where he knew he was gonna die like three or four times

1941
04:47:42,049 --> 04:47:49,040
Uh, how do I I guess we're going this way

1942
04:47:52,669 --> 04:47:55,549
Gamer dad it was only with that though. It was only with mario brothers

1943
04:47:56,349 --> 04:47:59,490
He didn't really play anything else

1944
04:47:59,490 --> 04:48:03,650
It was it was pretty wonderful

1945
04:48:06,909 --> 04:48:09,310
But he wouldn't beat the game for us

1946
04:48:10,430 --> 04:48:11,470
What?

1947
04:48:11,470 --> 04:48:14,860
I had nothing to do with that one

1948
04:48:19,729 --> 04:48:22,740
Uh-oh

1949
04:48:22,740 --> 04:48:25,310
Uh-oh

1950
04:48:25,310 --> 04:48:27,310
Okay, we're gonna have to do this strategically

1951
04:48:27,950 --> 04:49:15,220
One more I could use the force to find out what the fuck this thing is back in the regular shotgun, please

1952
04:49:15,939 --> 04:49:36,400
Gentlemen not a very good hiding

1953
04:49:42,880 --> 04:49:44,880
Oh, it's not explosive. Come on

1954
04:50:18,669 --> 04:50:22,029
He saw it was a silent under the breath of shit

1955
04:50:23,630 --> 04:50:30,590
You did there you're the one that killed me. You're the one that finally got rid of me. You finally killed me

1956
04:50:31,389 --> 04:50:33,389
Outplayed me completely

1957
04:50:34,900 --> 04:50:38,540
Shit I love this game so much

1958
04:50:39,599 --> 04:50:41,040
It's so

1959
04:50:41,040 --> 04:50:43,040
That's so stupid

1960
04:50:53,310 --> 04:51:07,439
Which way oh my god, what a fucking fun game

1961
04:51:17,740 --> 04:51:19,740
Uh, these guys are

1962
04:51:21,740 --> 04:51:27,569
I feel bad

1963
04:51:27,729 --> 04:51:35,520
What the fuck

1964
04:51:35,759 --> 04:51:48,959
Why is he not skeleton? Oh, no, no, no, no

1965
04:51:52,319 --> 04:51:58,590
Panicking I panicked like a lot a lot

1966
04:52:11,729 --> 04:52:14,740
Whoa

1967
04:52:15,060 --> 04:52:37,360
More health, right? That's not a terrible place to be in

1968
04:52:38,159 --> 04:52:40,849
I'm gonna die down here

1969
04:52:40,849 --> 04:52:42,369
Turn off the light

1970
04:52:42,369 --> 04:52:43,970
Reload the gun

1971
04:52:43,970 --> 04:52:47,090
And get ready for that and we're gonna do a wall bounce here

1972
04:52:50,659 --> 04:52:54,049
No, I don't think I need to

1973
04:52:55,759 --> 04:52:58,240
He backed into it. He stepped. Uh, you idiot

1974
04:53:04,659 --> 04:53:07,540
Did you kill everybody too? You did nice work

1975
04:53:13,360 --> 04:53:22,209
He's over here. Did I overthrow that?

1976
04:53:37,060 --> 04:53:39,700
I got him. I got that guy. I really did

1977
04:53:40,500 --> 04:53:56,540
What's over here?

1978
04:53:56,540 --> 04:53:59,439
Nothing. Okay

1979
04:53:59,439 --> 04:54:04,240
What in here? No

1980
04:54:05,439 --> 04:54:08,290
You're locking me in

1981
04:54:08,290 --> 04:54:13,409
They're locking me in

1982
04:54:13,409 --> 04:54:15,409
Fine. I'll just go down the sewer

1983
04:54:25,599 --> 04:54:27,599
I'm your favorite centipede streamer

1984
04:54:43,599 --> 04:55:09,549
Okay down we go, okay, I did that on purpose because I did I took a lot of damage for no reason

1985
04:55:31,340 --> 04:55:33,340
That was pretty brutal

1986
04:55:34,540 --> 04:55:36,540
Sorry about that. All right

1987
04:55:45,409 --> 04:56:12,720
Oh shit, he's coming down here. Goodbye. What was that? All right, there's the little shortcut

1988
04:56:13,279 --> 04:56:16,979
Get out of here

1989
04:56:16,979 --> 04:56:18,979
Up and under let's go

1990
04:56:19,060 --> 04:56:38,130
All right, there's traps everywhere just activate them

1991
04:56:40,830 --> 04:56:43,150
Shit, I may have fucked that up. It's all right

1992
04:56:46,830 --> 04:56:48,830
Well, whatever. I'm just gonna walk this way. Anyways

1993
04:57:01,860 --> 04:57:03,860
You check it out. I don't want to go over there

1994
04:57:05,459 --> 04:57:26,270
Couple of dopes

1995
04:57:26,270 --> 04:57:29,069
Somebody needs to make a fire extinguisher smash super cut

1996
04:57:32,290 --> 04:57:43,340
It's just available for me. So I do it and then turn this

1997
04:57:46,560 --> 04:57:50,479
No, i'm not exactly sure what that did, but it did something. So let's go up

1998
04:57:58,159 --> 04:57:59,439
It's just a

1999
04:57:59,439 --> 04:58:01,439
It's just a thing that I know

2000
04:58:01,599 --> 04:58:03,599
You know what I mean? It's routine

2001
04:58:04,479 --> 04:58:11,040
In a game with scary jump scares and all kinds of weird fucked up enemies. This is routine for me. It's comfortable

2002
04:58:11,520 --> 04:58:19,840
Okay, I can't go anywhere

2003
04:58:35,580 --> 04:58:36,939
Is it kill me

2004
04:58:36,939 --> 04:58:47,380
Unless I don't fuck it up. I'll be fine

2005
04:58:47,700 --> 04:58:55,060
Here we go. Costco is garbage tier pizza

2006
04:58:55,779 --> 04:59:00,189
Why would you eat Costco pizza?

2007
04:59:04,159 --> 04:59:05,439
Is it good?

2008
04:59:05,439 --> 04:59:07,060
I don't know

2009
04:59:07,060 --> 04:59:11,119
Because it's good

2010
04:59:11,119 --> 04:59:13,439
It's pizza tier list. It's good and cheap

2011
04:59:15,779 --> 04:59:20,500
I thought Costco is where you go buy like 40 tubes of toothpaste

2012
04:59:32,860 --> 04:59:35,099
No, hey, I wanted to do that

2013
04:59:36,930 --> 04:59:40,720
Why is it on tv?

2014
04:59:40,720 --> 04:59:42,720
That was so anticlimactic

2015
04:59:56,099 --> 04:59:57,619
He just like

2016
04:59:57,619 --> 05:00:07,900
I just wanted to do I want to do what needs to be done. Come on like that guy can't like get thrown into like a

2017
05:00:08,619 --> 05:00:10,619
One of like the silos or something

2018
05:00:11,619 --> 05:00:14,659
Well, yes, we're gonna slide kick his corpse off. Yes, that's don't worry

2019
05:00:19,500 --> 05:00:25,709
You think i'm not going to do that

2020
05:00:25,709 --> 05:00:28,049
Those things open every time

2021
05:00:28,049 --> 05:00:31,009
Those notebooks just go like that when you go near them

2022
05:00:31,729 --> 05:00:33,729
It's actually really strange

2023
05:00:41,700 --> 05:00:43,700
He's gonna be like hero

2024
05:00:44,099 --> 05:00:46,580
Come over here

2025
05:00:46,580 --> 05:00:51,250
There's one last thing I need to tell you right? Why is he like happy?

2026
05:00:51,810 --> 05:01:00,860
The only way in

2027
05:01:00,860 --> 05:01:10,369
Is to divert power to the door. Divert power to the vault door

2028
05:01:13,040 --> 05:01:14,240
I can't

2029
05:01:14,240 --> 05:01:15,759
You can't slide him off

2030
05:01:15,759 --> 05:01:23,569
One last meal for you

2031
05:01:23,569 --> 05:01:39,220
Still hungry

2032
05:01:39,220 --> 05:01:47,540
Why did I die from that? All right, tell me again

2033
05:01:48,180 --> 05:01:55,950
The only way in

2034
05:01:55,950 --> 05:01:57,950
Is to divert power to the door

2035
05:01:58,110 --> 05:02:11,250
Okay, i'll see if I can divert some power

2036
05:02:13,919 --> 05:02:19,279
You hang tight guy that'll be dead when I get back lying down further on his back and not breathing

2037
05:02:20,159 --> 05:02:28,959
see

2038
05:02:28,959 --> 05:02:40,909
Oh, i'm gonna go down this way

2039
05:02:40,990 --> 05:02:50,659
nothing

2040
05:02:50,659 --> 05:02:56,500
What the fuck do you keep doing that so well?

2041
05:02:57,139 --> 05:03:00,860
I'm gonna die

2042
05:03:00,860 --> 05:03:03,180
He's throwing another one. He's trying to throw another one

2043
05:03:07,630 --> 05:03:25,979
Turn off the flashlight

2044
05:03:25,979 --> 05:03:30,430
What is that? Oh, I guess I got health

2045
05:03:32,849 --> 05:03:33,889
Okay

2046
05:03:33,889 --> 05:03:37,819
Here we go

2047
05:03:37,819 --> 05:03:39,819
I'm taking this out. This thing is

2048
05:03:41,180 --> 05:03:45,020
You fucker

2049
05:04:02,720 --> 05:04:24,930
Really? All right. I need to start using the other gun. Did you drop one of these two? Didn't you? I guess not

2050
05:04:24,930 --> 05:04:27,419
All right. This thing's gotta be used

2051
05:04:27,419 --> 05:04:29,419
Get the fire extinguishers. No, i'm over that. No

2052
05:04:29,979 --> 05:04:40,099
I don't do that anymore

2053
05:04:40,099 --> 05:04:48,930
Say right

2054
05:04:48,930 --> 05:04:50,560
nice

2055
05:04:50,560 --> 05:04:54,080
Yeah, i'm over that i'm more into the magic notebook's opening though

2056
05:04:54,639 --> 05:04:56,479
I want to open those

2057
05:04:56,479 --> 05:04:57,680
fucking

2058
05:04:57,680 --> 05:04:59,680
Fire extinguishers are old news guys

2059
05:05:00,240 --> 05:05:17,099
Do we have power?

2060
05:05:17,099 --> 05:05:18,939
Is that what that means?

2061
05:05:18,939 --> 05:05:20,540
We're connected

2062
05:05:20,540 --> 05:05:27,950
We have a signal

2063
05:05:27,950 --> 05:05:34,830
Maybe I can't believe I used to do that shit

2064
05:05:36,599 --> 05:06:12,939
Embarrassing. Oh, let's just go check it. I thought that was damn it

2065
05:06:14,060 --> 05:06:16,619
Do I have to do both sides?

2066
05:06:16,939 --> 05:06:20,270
I mean that was a pretty elaborate

2067
05:06:20,349 --> 05:06:27,810
Thing that happened. Is it open? This does not look like it's open

2068
05:06:29,380 --> 05:06:31,380
It is not I have to do them both

2069
05:06:31,779 --> 05:07:04,080
So let's go this side. Did I go down here already? Did I was there on this side?

2070
05:07:07,340 --> 05:07:16,450
Yeah, it's already are they connected is both both sides the same thing

2071
05:07:17,009 --> 05:07:26,750
Do I have that right? Do I just have to do something else down there?

2072
05:07:27,310 --> 05:07:30,750
Or do I have to actually go to the other side and this is the side that I was on before

2073
05:07:31,470 --> 05:07:34,000
This went the wrong way. Yeah, that's what i'm figuring

2074
05:07:47,139 --> 05:07:47,939
so

2075
05:07:47,939 --> 05:07:49,939
Theoretically now i'm on the other side

2076
05:07:51,090 --> 05:07:53,229
No, i'm not

2077
05:07:53,229 --> 05:07:55,549
Am I? I'm fucking confused

2078
05:07:56,270 --> 05:08:03,099
What the fuck am I doing?

2079
05:08:03,180 --> 05:08:04,750
uh

2080
05:08:04,750 --> 05:08:10,459
Okay, so

2081
05:08:10,459 --> 05:08:12,340
They are connected

2082
05:08:12,419 --> 05:08:14,419
They're they're they are connected

2083
05:08:15,220 --> 05:08:17,810
so

2084
05:08:17,810 --> 05:08:19,970
I have to go back down to where I was before

2085
05:08:25,150 --> 05:08:30,380
Because they would that that device was down there. So

2086
05:08:31,740 --> 05:08:35,819
I don't it's not about two different sides. It's just going back down there and

2087
05:08:36,619 --> 05:08:38,220
pressing more buttons

2088
05:08:38,220 --> 05:08:44,110
Because I went right last time

2089
05:08:44,189 --> 05:08:48,189
Okay. Yeah, I thought I had to go like on the other side and there was another one of these

2090
05:08:48,990 --> 05:09:01,470
All right. This is double yellow

2091
05:09:06,909 --> 05:09:08,909
We have both the yellow switches in

2092
05:09:12,259 --> 05:09:13,540
Whatever the

2093
05:09:13,540 --> 05:09:22,819
Whatever that means

2094
05:09:22,819 --> 05:09:24,099
so now

2095
05:09:24,099 --> 05:09:31,650
Is that enough? Does that open another door to do the blue ones now?

2096
05:09:33,979 --> 05:09:34,939
I don't know

2097
05:09:34,939 --> 05:09:44,720
Or is that just power?

2098
05:09:44,720 --> 05:09:50,060
Well, this door is the two yellow now. I gotta find the two blue. All right, that's what you gotta do

2099
05:10:18,799 --> 05:10:30,799
All right, is he alive? Anybody else alive up here? I don't believe so

2100
05:10:32,540 --> 05:10:34,900
No, you're dead

2101
05:10:34,900 --> 05:10:36,900
Just making sure you're actually dead

2102
05:10:37,220 --> 05:10:55,630
Does that say caution no, this guy used to be my favorite fire extinguisher smasher

2103
05:10:56,349 --> 05:11:18,959
Sure, whatever you say. Let's get up there if I can

2104
05:11:19,919 --> 05:11:31,700
So I need to get up there. But what's secret? Is it great right there?

2105
05:11:33,540 --> 05:11:35,380
oh

2106
05:11:35,380 --> 05:11:36,580
Nice

2107
05:11:36,580 --> 05:11:39,299
I didn't know there's a magic notebook up there fucking sick

2108
05:11:47,810 --> 05:11:54,180
He's over this game. No, no, I'm not. I really am not i'm just a little drained

2109
05:11:56,110 --> 05:11:59,470
But that has nothing to do with the game it has to do with me

2110
05:12:02,369 --> 05:12:04,669
oh

2111
05:12:04,669 --> 05:12:06,830
Every fucking time it's awesome

2112
05:12:10,080 --> 05:12:16,419
Oh, there's other magic books

2113
05:12:16,419 --> 05:12:18,189
All right. So now

2114
05:12:18,189 --> 05:12:20,560
This is two yellow so I can open it

2115
05:12:20,560 --> 05:12:22,139
Nice

2116
05:12:22,139 --> 05:12:24,139
Hey, look at me. I'm up here

2117
05:12:24,220 --> 05:12:35,409
I hear something. Finally. I have two health. I haven't had two health packs in probably an

2118
05:12:43,090 --> 05:12:55,970
What is in the wall? All right long range think I can get it. No

2119
05:12:56,369 --> 05:12:58,369
I don't like it matters

2120
05:12:58,369 --> 05:13:00,799
Somebody somebody threw a grenade

2121
05:13:00,799 --> 05:13:04,639
And it hit me right in the head

2122
05:13:04,639 --> 05:13:06,639
I'm stuck in i'm stuck right now

2123
05:13:09,650 --> 05:13:17,069
I don't like that outcome

2124
05:13:44,560 --> 05:13:55,840
Fucking the grenades the grenades I got double tapped. I'm just going in fuck it

2125
05:13:59,220 --> 05:14:01,220
out of my way

2126
05:14:01,220 --> 05:14:38,080
What does he have for a weapon?

2127
05:14:42,590 --> 05:14:46,750
No, I don't want the outcome here. All right, let's go. Um, i'm actually done fucking around

2128
05:14:47,950 --> 05:15:47,939
That's fun. Where's the guy with the rocket launcher? He got I think it's serious there for a second even though I took two health packs

2129
05:15:48,740 --> 05:15:56,909
Streamer dies to grenade and goes bald

2130
05:16:00,139 --> 05:16:01,659
one of these days

2131
05:16:01,659 --> 05:16:05,840
Here's the real here. Listen, this is important one of these days

2132
05:16:06,479 --> 05:16:10,880
You know, let's say I stream for like another let's say I keep streaming for like another five to ten years

2133
05:16:11,520 --> 05:16:12,819
right

2134
05:16:12,819 --> 05:16:16,740
There's going to be a scenario where i'm going to actually be truly bald

2135
05:16:17,380 --> 05:16:19,779
Like an m on the top of my head back here

2136
05:16:22,020 --> 05:16:24,340
And you guys are gonna have so much fun

2137
05:16:24,979 --> 05:16:34,180
I want this up. Isn't that too yellow?

2138
05:16:45,540 --> 05:16:56,290
Um, i'm gonna go up. Can I even go up anymore?

2139
05:16:57,409 --> 05:17:02,029
nice

2140
05:17:02,029 --> 05:17:09,500
confused

2141
05:17:09,500 --> 05:17:11,500
Glitch it out and get up there

2142
05:17:16,180 --> 05:17:26,959
Because this door doesn't open I get up here. So why can't I get this door open?

2143
05:17:27,680 --> 05:17:45,090
Is there a problem with this? Why can't I open the toilet room? That means I have to go back through

2144
05:17:45,970 --> 05:18:13,569
Where do I go? No one tell him. Wait, maybe no one tell him

2145
05:18:21,340 --> 05:18:24,770
All right, is this blue?

2146
05:18:24,770 --> 05:18:26,209
Blue blue

2147
05:18:26,209 --> 05:18:55,950
She's not in there. Line like round, right? Here blue is not ready. Where is it?

2148
05:19:03,060 --> 05:19:39,619
Wait, wait, wait, what's going on there? What is this in the way? What do you mean? We'll fucking get rid of it. Okay

2149
05:19:41,060 --> 05:20:13,090
There we go. We got dated upload get it uploaded. Get over here. That's it. Now plug the damn thing in

2150
05:20:21,200 --> 05:20:22,880
Be on shoulder

2151
05:20:22,880 --> 05:20:38,099
Will you guys relax and then I gotta go through that door

2152
05:20:41,169 --> 05:20:43,169
Blue blue, right? There it is

2153
05:20:48,590 --> 05:20:52,459
Cool. Let's go

2154
05:20:52,459 --> 05:20:54,459
Now I need red

2155
05:20:58,700 --> 05:21:10,939
Red and red and that's it. You have bees all over your skin

2156
05:21:12,180 --> 05:21:14,180
Shit, I should probably go to the doctor

2157
05:21:23,900 --> 05:21:29,229
Cool. All right. So that leads me to now. I need to go back to the door

2158
05:21:30,029 --> 05:21:32,909
That I just was at because that won't open

2159
05:21:33,630 --> 05:21:41,520
But now it should open now. I wonder if my hypothesis is going to be correct

2160
05:21:42,000 --> 05:22:02,459
It is okay. Well

2161
05:22:11,119 --> 05:22:49,229
Hey, hey, why is it why is it just dust out of here? All right, i've had enough of this

2162
05:22:50,049 --> 05:22:51,889
I hate these things

2163
05:22:51,889 --> 05:22:54,610
How the fuck you rely you're supposed to kill these things without them

2164
05:22:55,650 --> 05:22:57,650
arcade machining you

2165
05:22:59,860 --> 05:23:03,459
I like that. Okay, nice. This thing's not even that bad. They're fine

2166
05:23:04,020 --> 05:23:16,819
I remember when I thought that was fun

2167
05:23:20,880 --> 05:23:22,080
memories

2168
05:23:22,080 --> 05:23:25,470
It's like looking at an old photo

2169
05:23:25,549 --> 05:23:55,680
No, I don't where are the items?

2170
05:23:55,680 --> 05:23:57,759
That's new

2171
05:23:57,759 --> 05:24:01,020
What's in there? Who knows?

2172
05:24:01,619 --> 05:24:05,229
We'll never know till I go this way

2173
05:24:06,189 --> 05:24:12,319
I'll take that heal, please. Thank you

2174
05:24:19,200 --> 05:24:20,799
pretzel germa

2175
05:24:20,799 --> 05:24:38,700
What do you mean pretzel pretzel is the rocket launcher? I don't think I want it

2176
05:24:40,689 --> 05:24:42,689
No, fuck that thing. Okay

2177
05:24:43,779 --> 05:24:45,459
So what is this for

2178
05:24:45,459 --> 05:24:47,060
Something to do with this

2179
05:24:47,060 --> 05:24:49,740
What do I need to do with this thing?

2180
05:24:51,200 --> 05:24:52,959
I tried shooting it

2181
05:24:52,959 --> 05:24:57,490
Is something else here wouldn't grab if I put some barrels in here?

2182
05:25:00,529 --> 05:25:10,799
Shoot the ones that explode

2183
05:25:10,799 --> 05:25:14,049
Get inside

2184
05:25:14,049 --> 05:25:16,049
Okay, get inside

2185
05:25:24,700 --> 05:25:27,419
That's a lot but whatever I hear those

2186
05:25:28,619 --> 05:25:40,209
stupid robots

2187
05:25:40,610 --> 05:25:42,610
They're in like the ceiling

2188
05:25:42,930 --> 05:25:53,150
Did I go in

2189
05:25:53,150 --> 05:26:09,950
Maybe I should go in I need to get up there. Can I just walk over there? I sure can

2190
05:26:23,180 --> 05:26:25,180
I was trying to get superpowers

2191
05:26:25,819 --> 05:26:32,979
All right. We're good

2192
05:26:32,979 --> 05:26:35,139
No, I shouldn't uh, I didn't mean to do that

2193
05:26:35,779 --> 05:26:37,779
I wanted to get a good view

2194
05:26:37,779 --> 05:26:41,330

That's it to go through the door now

2202
05:28:24,319 --> 05:28:29,169

05:29:26,400 --> 05:29:28,619
What does he have?

2207
05:29:28,619 --> 05:29:30,619
mustache and a big brain

2208
05:29:34,720 --> 05:29:38,049
Good luck

2209
05:29:38,450 --> 05:29:40,450
You take walls down with this thing

2210
05:29:55,860 --> 05:30:11,729
All right. Well, what about here we go. I don't i'm gonna save this i'm gonna use the default shotgun

2211
05:30:12,290 --> 05:30:14,369
It's my bread and butter. You guys know that

2212
05:30:14,930 --> 05:30:24,959
Build them all i'm not this shit again. You still don't know do you?

2213
05:30:25,520 --> 05:30:27,549
What you are?

2214
05:30:27,630 --> 05:30:32,110
Why here what's the first thing you remember?

2215
05:30:32,590 --> 05:30:47,680
It's the joker given name. That's the joker. Where were you born history? I don't know. Where was I born?

2216
05:30:54,580 --> 05:31:00,189
You and the same mother

2217
05:31:02,349 --> 05:31:06,189
Okay, can you tell me the story without me having to shoot ghosts? You must have sensed it

2218
05:31:06,430 --> 05:31:10,990
Like just tell me see in your mind, but perhaps you can see into hers

2219
05:31:12,110 --> 05:31:16,340
Life of waking from mind yourself

2220
05:31:17,380 --> 05:31:22,400
And another will set her free

2221
05:31:28,500 --> 05:31:29,540
Damn it

2222
05:31:29,540 --> 05:31:32,270
Can we rain check? I don't have any grenades

2223
05:31:46,770 --> 05:32:09,069
What but what happened this soldier's just been watching just oh shit

2224
05:32:10,740 --> 05:32:53,979
That's the real time to say that is right now. I just fucking hurt myself

2225
05:33:00,990 --> 05:33:07,009
I thought this is a dream

2226
05:33:07,090 --> 05:33:08,529
What do I have my weapons?

2227
05:33:08,529 --> 05:34:07,169
Just this okay

2228
05:34:07,169 --> 05:34:14,909
Shit, it's fucked up

2229
05:34:24,270 --> 05:34:31,919
You probably shouldn't shoot the volatile ball of destructive gas

2230
05:34:32,880 --> 05:34:45,439
Hey, hey open up. It's me

2231
05:34:46,639 --> 05:34:52,779
Actually be more like this. It'd be like

2232
05:34:56,540 --> 05:35:05,150
You can't hear me

2233
05:35:05,150 --> 05:35:14,779
Oh, no

2234
05:35:14,779 --> 05:35:16,779
Get away from me. Get away from me

2235
05:35:39,250 --> 05:36:02,400
I do appreciate the golem run. It has to be in every horror movie. What's that?

2236
05:36:03,680 --> 05:36:19,540
Smoke over here. What does it do? Uh

2237
05:36:20,500 --> 05:36:29,700
Who opened up the portal to hell a lot of damage there?

2238
05:36:34,270 --> 05:37:08,430
You did you did this? Okay, just lying around. Let's use the pistol for the first time ever

2239
05:37:09,549 --> 05:37:17,419
Yeah, i'll use the pistol. It's like kind of fun to shoot. It's only taken me until the last

2240
05:37:18,299 --> 05:37:22,740
20 minutes of the game to realize it's a fun weapon. It's not as good as the super shotgun

2241
05:37:28,189 --> 05:37:38,900
Which way this way

2242
05:37:38,900 --> 05:37:52,349
Nope escape and destroy expose and destroy reactor cells to sabotage energy pylons

2243
05:37:53,549 --> 05:38:13,970
Hey, that doesn't that doesn't cause damage

2244
05:38:26,990 --> 05:38:28,990
Shoot all the yellow spots

2245
05:38:40,619 --> 05:38:45,360
Uh, am I getting in close?

2246
05:38:46,080 --> 05:39:10,909
Can I do it?

2247
05:39:10,909 --> 05:39:20,400
Okay, go

2248
05:39:20,400 --> 05:39:22,849
Uh-oh

2249
05:39:22,849 --> 05:39:26,180
What the hell?

2250
05:39:26,180 --> 05:39:27,700

Don't break i'm almost out of bullets

2273
05:43:23,630 --> 05:43:27,540
I'm almost out of bullets and then I have to use the shotgun that hurts me

2274
05:43:29,069 --> 05:43:34,220
Nope, i'm gonna

2275
05:43:34,220 --> 05:43:37,840
No

2276
05:43:37,840 --> 05:43:39,840
I didn't want to have a temper tantrum. Like where is it?

2277
05:43:42,689 --> 05:43:44,689
I've been able to do this the whole game

2278
05:43:46,659 --> 05:43:48,659
I've been able to punch the whole game

2279
05:43:51,299 --> 05:43:55,040
No

2280
05:43:55,040 --> 05:43:58,000
Oh, but there's so much fun things I could have done

2281
05:44:01,680 --> 05:44:06,020
Where's the gun? What happened to the gun? There's like two guns. I want

2282
05:44:06,819 --> 05:44:13,549
The other one what I don't even know where it is. It exploded and flew away. That's great

2283
05:44:13,630 --> 05:44:15,630
Okay, whatever. I'm just gonna put this on for now

2284
05:44:16,959 --> 05:44:21,580
There's nothing around

2285
05:44:21,580 --> 05:44:51,680
Yeah, I put that's doesn't hurt right? There's a lot of weapons here

2286
05:44:52,400 --> 05:45:18,180
Close the portals

2287
05:45:18,180 --> 05:45:31,869
This gun is too good, but I don't I can't get close with it

2288
05:45:39,569 --> 05:45:43,310
I almost just fell through that

2289
05:45:43,310 --> 05:45:45,069
You've got to be kidding me

2290
05:45:45,069 --> 05:46:06,590
I'm supposed to fall through that the machine gun god one of these is like this day to jump now

2291
05:46:07,470 --> 05:46:12,270
Now this is a way scarier game than the last

2292
05:46:13,409 --> 05:46:39,869
Seven to eight straight hours of this game. I've tried so hard to forget

2293
05:47:13,470 --> 05:47:16,740
You were born in this place

2294
05:47:19,389 --> 05:47:21,389
Place I was there

2295
05:47:21,950 --> 05:47:23,389
This place

2296
05:47:23,389 --> 05:47:25,389
That's me

2297
05:47:25,389 --> 05:47:27,229
That's me

2298
05:47:27,229 --> 05:47:29,229
Making those noises

2299
05:48:05,740 --> 05:48:40,220
You will be back to the box. Okay

2300
05:48:40,860 --> 05:48:59,250
Let's leave

2301
05:48:59,250 --> 05:49:10,220
Rick did I do it? That doesn't seem right

2302
05:49:15,970 --> 05:49:24,430
That's not right that's incorrect that doesn't seem like the right uh, can I get back in the room go back in this room?

2303
05:49:25,979 --> 05:49:27,979
Go quick. Go get in the bathtub

2304
05:49:28,540 --> 05:49:32,220
Go get in the bathtub. That's what you're supposed to do. Go get in the bathtub

2305
05:49:32,939 --> 05:49:50,619
I think i'm dead massive explosion detected by a Hannibal 3 spy satellite in the vicinity of classified

2306
05:49:51,259 --> 05:49:55,740
Silly moments before signal was lost efforts to reestablish link on successful status of fear operative unknown

2307
05:50:19,020 --> 05:50:21,020
I'm

2308
05:50:24,860 --> 05:50:26,860
Since the explosion

2309
05:50:29,569 --> 05:50:32,259
What happened to us?

2310
05:50:38,099 --> 05:50:40,529
What how is that epilogue

2311
05:50:44,590 --> 05:50:46,029
epilogue

2312
05:50:46,029 --> 05:50:49,740
We just we just watched it

2313
05:50:50,299 --> 05:50:52,639
mushroom cloud and then

2314
05:50:52,639 --> 05:50:54,880
The ring lady went in the end of the helicopter

2315
05:50:55,599 --> 05:51:06,020
It's got to set us up for fear, too

2316
05:51:06,020 --> 05:51:08,099
The helicopter you're on got attacked again

2317
05:51:08,900 --> 05:51:11,740
attacked again

2318
05:51:11,740 --> 05:51:12,700
Yeah

2319
05:51:12,700 --> 05:51:17,650
Either the how long are the expansions?

2320
05:51:22,110 --> 05:51:24,830
Are they a couple hours each or how do they play out?

2321
05:51:28,540 --> 05:51:30,540
Four hours. That's not bad

2322
05:51:31,740 --> 05:51:33,020
well

2323
05:51:33,020 --> 05:51:35,020
So here's here's what we're going to do for the next

2324
05:51:35,020 --> 05:51:37,020
Uh a few days

2325
05:51:37,340 --> 05:51:39,340
I'm not going to be streaming tomorrow

2326
05:51:40,939 --> 05:51:42,700
But we are going to go

2327
05:51:42,700 --> 05:51:49,150
Stop falling over. We are going to do uh, I originally was going to do today yesterday

2328
05:51:49,709 --> 05:51:53,069
And then saturday sunday, but we're going to do saturday sunday monday

2329
05:51:57,729 --> 05:51:58,770
so

2330
05:51:58,770 --> 05:52:03,009
We'll instead of doing four days. We'll do like five for the last six days

2331
05:52:05,599 --> 05:52:07,599
And what's on the list?

2332
05:52:08,340 --> 05:52:13,700
There are a few things actually there's rhythm games, which i'm probably going to break up the horror stuff

2333
05:52:15,409 --> 05:52:18,909
But we are eventually going to make our way to this

2334
05:52:19,630 --> 05:52:25,259
This is siren for the playstation 2

2335
05:52:28,380 --> 05:52:30,029
and

2336
05:52:30,029 --> 05:52:34,240
and

2337
05:52:34,240 --> 05:52:39,360
Last of the probably the horror games that i'm going to put at least some significant time in

2338
05:52:40,319 --> 05:52:44,849
Is this one?

2339
05:52:44,849 --> 05:52:46,849
We've got some interesting stuff for sure

2340
05:52:50,930 --> 05:52:54,130
The thing in siren are probably the how we're going to round out and then the halloween stream

2341
05:52:55,869 --> 05:52:59,229
Now that's a yeah, i've heard i've never played this

2342
05:53:03,229 --> 05:53:05,470
That game is hard as sin. Well, it's all right

2343
05:53:06,930 --> 05:53:09,009
You guys can help me

2344
05:53:09,009 --> 05:53:14,590
You guys can help me out in these ones. So don't worry, but i'm not streaming tomorrow

2345
05:53:15,310 --> 05:53:17,470
i'm just gonna try to gain some energy

2346
05:53:19,250 --> 05:53:20,770
and hopefully

2347
05:53:20,770 --> 05:53:22,209
by

2348
05:53:22,209 --> 05:53:24,209
The end of this week. I'll be a little bit more

2349
05:53:25,330 --> 05:53:28,049
Used to me having to use this medication

2350
05:53:28,849 --> 05:53:32,450
Because i'm really only going to be on it for another probably four or five days

2351
05:53:34,180 --> 05:53:35,540
so

2352
05:53:35,540 --> 05:53:37,619
Yeah, do less cocaine

2353
05:53:38,909 --> 05:53:42,509
Yes, and by less i mean you mean zero and by zero you mean never

2354
05:53:47,459 --> 05:53:52,340
Yeah, i'm really i'm just doing less cocaine over the last of the next few weeks

2355
05:53:53,439 --> 05:54:05,680
Jesus christ

2356
05:54:05,680 --> 05:54:07,680
Jerma strikes me as an e guy

2357
05:54:08,400 --> 05:54:11,919
No, jerma should strike you as a guy that likes salad and bananas

2358
05:54:12,400 --> 05:54:16,479
He likes eating salads and bananas and sometimes he has like captain crunch sometimes

2359
05:54:20,639 --> 05:54:24,259
What?

2360
05:54:24,259 --> 05:54:28,580
I like I don't do drugs. That's what i'm saying. I don't do drugs

2361
05:54:30,259 --> 05:54:32,259
I don't do drugs

2362
05:54:33,549 --> 05:54:36,130
I don't do drugs

2363
05:54:40,240 --> 05:54:42,240
That's not true. I'm on them right now

2364
05:54:44,819 --> 05:54:46,500
Oh

2365
05:54:46,580 --> 05:54:48,580
I mean like prescription

2366
05:54:49,139 --> 05:54:51,569

2367
05:54:51,569 --> 05:54:53,569
Hey, thanks for watching everybody

2368
05:55:04,319 --> 05:55:06,319
I'll see you. Uh on the next one

2369
05:55:07,790 --> 05:55:11,549
Not tomorrow, but the next day and the next day and then we'll do three days in a row after tomorrow

2370
05:55:13,790 --> 05:55:15,790
i'm gonna spend most of tomorrow just

2371
05:55:18,099 --> 05:55:20,099
Trying to energize again

2372
05:55:20,099 --> 05:55:22,979
I've just been so tired. This

2373
05:55:23,060 --> 05:55:27,939
It's definitely the med this medicine is making me so fucking exhausted. I don't even know why it shouldn't

2374
05:55:28,900 --> 05:55:31,709
I just broke all my bones

2375
05:55:35,330 --> 05:55:37,330
But you do what you gotta do, right?

2376
05:55:37,569 --> 05:55:42,159
Someone just wrote good

2377
05:55:42,159 --> 05:55:45,740
What's wrong with some of you guys?

2378
05:55:47,310 --> 05:55:49,069
Why?

2379
05:55:49,069 --> 05:55:50,110
All right

2380
05:55:50,110 --> 05:55:52,110
Uh, i'll see you guys on

2381
05:55:52,189 --> 05:55:55,549
No, what's today? Hold on. Let me look at the let me look at the actual what I want to do

2382
05:55:55,630 --> 05:55:58,349
Yeah, so tuesday wednesday friday saturday sunday

2383
05:56:00,939 --> 05:56:03,630
Yeah, that sounds good to me

2384
05:56:03,709 --> 05:56:04,990
and then

2385
05:56:04,990 --> 05:56:07,250
I gotta hold on. I gotta really plan this out because

2386
05:56:09,659 --> 05:56:11,659
If I do saturday sunday monday

2387
05:56:11,900 --> 05:56:14,590
And then maybe

2388
05:56:14,590 --> 05:56:17,709
Because the halloween stream is going to take a few days to set up

2389
05:56:21,759 --> 05:56:23,759
So now that there'll be plenty of time to do at least

2390
05:56:24,479 --> 05:56:28,159
Because before how the halloween stream i'll be live how many more times

2391
05:56:30,209 --> 05:56:32,209
See one two three

2392
05:56:32,610 --> 05:56:34,610
We'll get some rhythm games done

2393
05:56:35,139 --> 05:56:37,139
And then it'd be like one or two

2394
05:56:37,139 --> 05:56:39,139
Or one day there two days off there

2395
05:56:39,939 --> 05:56:44,580
And then like one two, three four. Yeah, there's definitely plenty of time to do at least one. All right. Let me ask you then

2396
05:56:45,220 --> 05:56:46,659
So I can plan this

2397
05:56:46,659 --> 05:56:49,619
What would you rather see over the course of a couple of streams?

2398
05:56:50,669 --> 05:56:52,509
the thing or siren

2399
05:56:52,509 --> 05:56:54,159
because

2400
05:56:54,159 --> 05:56:56,479
There's only really one of them that I could do and get it done

2401
05:56:57,119 --> 05:56:58,860
I would assume

2402
05:56:58,860 --> 05:57:01,020
I'm gonna do a straw poll right now where there's still people here

2403
05:57:07,819 --> 05:57:11,819
If I can do them both I will if I can if I can make that happen

2404
05:57:11,819 --> 05:57:16,060
But i'm pretty sure both these games are at least 12 to 15 plus hours long

2405
05:57:19,200 --> 05:57:21,919
And look if if it's not interesting I could you know

2406
05:57:22,560 --> 05:57:28,880
And move on

2407
05:57:28,880 --> 05:57:30,880
They both are gonna be interesting

2408
05:57:31,700 --> 05:57:36,099
just because I you know, I did a little bit of research to see

2409
05:57:36,979 --> 05:57:38,979
What's the thing the thing?

2410
05:57:39,060 --> 05:57:41,939
Is the sequel to the movie?

2411
05:57:43,250 --> 05:57:45,490
It's actually I believe it is actual canon

2412
05:57:46,299 --> 05:57:49,020
This is like what they did for a sequel

2413
05:57:50,369 --> 05:58:01,419
The thing is a sequel to the actual the thing movie and this is still very close

2414
05:58:05,279 --> 05:58:08,959
Yeah, you have like a squad in this game and you have to control everybody's emotions

2415
05:58:10,779 --> 05:58:14,860
People sometimes don't trust you. They think that you're the thing instead. It just seems like a

2416
05:58:15,580 --> 05:58:18,060
fun experience at least for a couple of streams

2417
05:58:26,180 --> 05:58:28,180
And siren from my understanding

2418
05:58:28,659 --> 05:58:30,819
Is a game where you control multiple?

2419
05:58:32,159 --> 05:58:33,939
protagonists

2420
05:58:33,939 --> 05:58:36,099
You choose a protagonist that you want to play

2421
05:58:37,139 --> 05:58:39,220
For that particular chapter or something, right?

2422
05:58:42,380 --> 05:58:44,380
They both seem pretty interesting

2423
05:58:46,139 --> 05:58:51,099
And siren siren is going to be probably much scarier than the thing. The thing is going to be more

2424
05:58:52,299 --> 05:58:54,459
third person creepy gross

2425
05:58:55,580 --> 05:58:59,340
Action game whereas siren is I believe an actual horror scary game

2426
05:59:03,009 --> 05:59:08,909
But uh, i'm i'm gonna call this here in a second if you have not decided if you've not picked

2427
05:59:09,630 --> 05:59:11,630
I suggest you do because it is very close

2428
05:59:17,950 --> 05:59:19,950
They're both horror games

2429
05:59:19,950 --> 05:59:22,189
They both are technically horror games

2430
05:59:22,830 --> 05:59:25,860
But I think siren is just a

2431
05:59:27,220 --> 05:59:28,740
scarier game

2432
05:59:28,740 --> 05:59:30,740
And the thing is more actiony

2433
05:59:31,680 --> 05:59:34,000
The thing is probably more like fear was

2434
05:59:46,419 --> 05:59:50,049
All right. Can you re-vote? What do you mean re-vote?

2435
05:59:54,459 --> 05:59:56,459
re-vote

2436
06:00:02,939 --> 06:00:04,939
You didn't know what the games were

2437
06:00:06,819 --> 06:00:09,700
Wait, so if you didn't know what they were, why did you pick one?

2438
06:00:11,790 --> 06:00:16,590
I said, what would you rather see me play this or this? It's like, ah this one, but it's like, all right. Well

2439
06:00:24,209 --> 06:00:26,209
Shut up, just let me re-vote

2440
06:00:29,740 --> 06:00:32,860
They're both very good apparently so don't worry and i'm gonna play

2441
06:00:33,500 --> 06:00:37,819
I didn't get them to not play them. I just which one would you which one would you rather see first?

2442
06:00:41,439 --> 06:00:44,939
All right. All right. That's it. That's it. We're doing the thing

2443
06:00:45,500 --> 06:01:00,669
That's the one we're gonna be doing the thing

2444
06:01:03,200 --> 06:01:05,700
And the siren will happen

2445
06:01:05,700 --> 06:01:11,970
Probably immediately after it. Let me change my vote

2446
06:01:12,770 --> 06:01:14,450
mad face

2447
06:01:14,450 --> 06:01:16,450
No, wait, you'll see them both. Don't worry

2448
06:01:20,380 --> 06:01:22,380
What is this

2449
06:01:23,580 --> 06:01:25,090
All right

2450
06:01:25,090 --> 06:01:29,009
I love this game. All right, I'll give my my final thoughts on the urgent of the fear

2451
06:01:30,189 --> 06:01:33,389
No, not the the it's not the thing. It's it's not the fear on fear

2452
06:01:35,180 --> 06:01:39,279
That was very good. It was just fun

2453
06:01:40,419 --> 06:01:46,020
And that's all you want out of a video game. Yeah, I just it's it was just fun

2454
06:01:47,310 --> 06:01:51,549
They got a little repetitive in a couple places, but it was still fun. I still liked it

2455
06:01:53,680 --> 06:01:57,549
Good stuff. All right. Let's do the

2456
06:01:58,509 --> 06:02:01,060
Let's do the bits

2457
06:02:01,060 --> 06:02:03,680
Have them open here from earlier

2458
06:02:03,919 --> 06:02:09,950
And if you take it off, we'll see you again this weekend

2459
06:02:12,590 --> 06:02:14,189
for a

2460
06:02:14,189 --> 06:02:18,669
Saturday Sunday and then monday extravaganza three days in a row will do

2461
06:02:26,639 --> 06:02:31,200
But I thought no, it was great. I loved in nearly every second of playing fear

2462
06:02:31,840 --> 06:02:34,799
It was great

2463
06:02:34,799 --> 06:02:38,159
And the oh shit stuff is is it gonna be stuck there forever in my brain?

2464
06:02:38,959 --> 06:02:42,740
All right. We'll see you on uh on Saturday if you're leaving

2465
06:02:43,919 --> 06:02:45,200
Thanks for joining us

2466
06:02:45,200 --> 06:02:50,880
And for the rest of you, we've got a few things to talk about we've got some bits to do

2467
06:02:51,360 --> 06:03:01,090
Let's go back to earlier today

2468
06:03:02,880 --> 06:03:04,720
We had 300 bits from

2469
06:03:04,720 --> 06:03:06,159
kore

2470
06:03:06,159 --> 06:03:08,400
Who says hello, mr streamer. Hope you're feeling good today

2471
06:03:09,200 --> 06:03:13,840
Uh, it's cool. You're doing eu friendly streams now. Also, do you think you'll play planet zoo when it comes out?

2472
06:03:14,939 --> 06:03:16,319
Uh, absolutely

2473
06:03:16,319 --> 06:03:19,819
I just didn't want to play the beta because I wanted to do the complete game

2474
06:03:20,700 --> 06:03:23,180
I didn't want to be limited by anything and that that's not I

2475
06:03:23,819 --> 06:03:27,180
Hold on this top sub gifter thing is just all fucked up. I'm gonna change it

2476
06:03:27,740 --> 06:03:36,180
Okay, here we go. Let's try it again. If it's still me. All right, if this is still me i'm going to uninstall stream labs. OBS

2477
06:03:38,259 --> 06:03:47,099
All right, it's gone

2478
06:03:47,099 --> 06:03:53,889
Okay, it's gone. All right. Uh, but anyways

2479
06:03:54,529 --> 06:03:57,150
Yeah, planet zoo. I just

2480
06:03:57,310 --> 06:04:01,950
Limited in the sense that I it's not like oh i'm so good at these games and i'm so talented

2481
06:04:01,950 --> 06:04:05,790
And so creative with all of my my I look at my habitats. I've no

2482
06:04:06,590 --> 06:04:10,189
But I just want all the animals. I just want to I just want access to everything

2483
06:04:15,569 --> 06:04:17,569
And that's coming out soon, isn't it?

2484
06:04:18,049 --> 06:04:28,990
What are the rhythm games gonna be? They've got a parapher the rapper parapher the rapper too. I'm jammer lamby buster groove

2485
06:04:29,389 --> 06:04:30,830
guitaro man

2486
06:04:30,830 --> 06:04:32,830
and uh

2487
06:04:32,830 --> 06:04:36,400
What's the other one? It's like one more

2488
06:04:40,080 --> 06:04:42,080
Is at least uh one more that I have?

2489
06:04:42,159 --> 06:04:48,189
Yeah, all great games. Yeah guitaro man is god tier. Oh, yeah

2490
06:04:49,150 --> 06:04:51,650
And guess what?

2491
06:04:51,650 --> 06:04:53,810
I've never played it

2492
06:04:53,810 --> 06:04:59,409
I saw it in stores. I've seen people play it. I've never held the controller in my hand and played guitaro man

2493
06:05:00,130 --> 06:05:07,069
So it's gonna be blind

2494
06:05:07,069 --> 06:05:12,799
Can't wait, but yeah, i've dialed the streams back a couple hours just because I know

2495
06:05:13,869 --> 06:05:15,869
that living in pacific

2496
06:05:15,950 --> 06:05:17,950
Daylight time still whatever it is

2497
06:05:18,349 --> 06:05:23,709
Streams get late for everybody. So I don't want to start at like four o'clock anymore starting around one or two is much better

2498
06:05:24,430 --> 06:05:26,909
For everybody me included

2499
06:05:26,909 --> 06:05:29,709
So yeah, i'm happy that people think it's a good start

2500
06:05:30,939 --> 06:05:32,939
Sad vega. Thanks for the 250

2501
06:05:34,049 --> 06:05:38,450
Your voicemail question is nonsense. I left one about 10 minutes ago and got a call back

2502
06:05:39,090 --> 06:05:43,330
I do it for a living we have people like you you make our lives hell

2503
06:05:43,970 --> 06:05:47,729
We have our tickets open sitting there forever because they never pick up and they never reply

2504
06:05:48,369 --> 06:05:51,409
You wanted our help. Why won't you return our calls you monster?

2505
06:05:57,979 --> 06:06:04,799
But here's the thing

2506
06:06:04,799 --> 06:06:08,080
I got no, I have no excuse. You're right. It's it's not nice. You're right

2507
06:06:08,479 --> 06:06:15,419
Uh, but I it's everybody. It's everybody. It's everyone. It's not just me

2508
06:06:16,529 --> 06:06:22,049
When I brought that up, I I I think 3 000 people all said that they do the same thing

2509
06:06:23,599 --> 06:06:25,840
So it's a it's a whole it's an us problem

2510
06:06:27,229 --> 06:06:28,880
You know

2511
06:06:28,880 --> 06:06:31,119
Until we find out a way to have

2512
06:06:31,659 --> 06:06:35,279
Voicemails be you know what voicemails will be gone in 10 years. Anyways, doesn't matter

2513
06:06:36,990 --> 06:06:39,869
You'll be able to get a text message and it'll just be read in your brain

2514
06:06:40,669 --> 06:06:42,669
You'll get like tts text messages

2515
06:06:43,310 --> 06:06:45,229
You can just turn them on

2516
06:06:45,229 --> 06:06:48,990
So yeah, the voicemails will won't exist in like another probably 10 20 years

2517
06:06:50,479 --> 06:06:52,479
So your job will get way easier

2518
06:06:55,250 --> 06:07:01,310
Hey, just a sad boy. Thanks for 300 bits. No message. Just

2519
06:07:02,029 --> 06:07:10,259
300 bits. Thank you. Uh, thank you. Emmanuel depressed. Thanks for the 500 bits

2520
06:07:12,909 --> 06:07:14,909
German, I know the stock trading joke is a thing

2521
06:07:15,389 --> 06:07:21,389
But do you still dabble in stocks and if so, what kind of stocks do you buy and any stock trading tips from the richest streamer on earth?

2522
06:07:22,430 --> 06:07:23,709
Okay, thanks

2523
06:07:23,709 --> 06:07:32,450
I'm of the opinion that you should never take trading advice from anyone because everybody's guessing

2524
06:07:35,549 --> 06:07:38,110
You just have to try to use your best judgment on what you think

2525
06:07:38,669 --> 06:07:42,430
If you're gonna just kind of play around with like a little bit of money and don't ever use

2526
06:07:44,590 --> 06:07:47,389
That much money when you play when you like trade

2527
06:07:48,029 --> 06:07:51,869
Is not don't do that. If you want to have like a little robin hood account or something where you

2528
06:07:52,529 --> 06:07:57,090
Mess around with like 30 40 50 bucks or something, but don't don't like all right

2529
06:07:57,729 --> 06:07:59,970
I guess i'll buy 10 grand worth of

2530
06:08:00,770 --> 06:08:04,240
Apple and then it's just it's gonna maybe it'll go up tomorrow

2531
06:08:10,380 --> 06:08:16,080
Uh, but if anyone ever tells you let me let me tell you something. I got so many let me tell you

2532
06:08:16,080 --> 06:08:19,759
I know everything about the stock market. I got this I got that I I you know, I got this chart

2533
06:08:19,759 --> 06:08:25,950
I've got this let me tell you that's you gotta buy this one. No, just go just eat a banana

2534
06:08:26,349 --> 06:08:34,860
He's talking to his past self

2535
06:08:42,509 --> 06:08:44,509
Banana stocks

2536
06:08:45,150 --> 06:08:49,150
And maybe you'll calm down

2537
06:08:49,150 --> 06:08:51,389
And maybe you'll get the right amount of potassium

2538
06:08:53,139 --> 06:08:55,139
I don't think you guys realize just how

2539
06:08:56,400 --> 06:08:58,080
many problems

2540
06:08:58,080 --> 06:08:59,520
are solvable

2541
06:08:59,520 --> 06:09:02,159
With a banana just by consuming a banana

2542
06:09:05,090 --> 06:09:06,689
That is the world's

2543
06:09:06,689 --> 06:09:23,580
Most versatile fruit it does everything he's saying invest in no i'm not saying to invest in but no, why would you do that?

2544
06:09:26,169 --> 06:09:27,150
oh

2545
06:09:27,150 --> 06:09:28,819
w

2546
06:09:28,819 --> 06:09:30,819
Oh, why did I read that?

2547
06:09:32,560 --> 06:09:34,880
I hate bananas. I used to too

2548
06:09:35,759 --> 06:09:38,900
I did

2549
06:09:41,299 --> 06:09:43,299
I don't know why I read that but

2550
06:09:43,939 --> 06:09:48,819
No, here's the one thing that you need that i've realized over the last five to ten years

2551
06:09:51,729 --> 06:09:55,040
you can't

2552
06:09:55,040 --> 06:10:00,799
You can't tell people what to do with their money like because then you almost become responsible

2553
06:10:01,360 --> 06:10:03,360
For if that something goes wrong

2554
06:10:03,520 --> 06:10:09,299
You know what I mean? Let's just say for instance and i'm gonna put a huge gigantic asterisk on here

2555
06:10:11,139 --> 06:10:14,659
This is a joke scenario. This is not real

2556
06:10:15,299 --> 06:10:18,520
And the following sentences are are fabricated

2557
06:10:22,459 --> 06:10:28,459
If I told you to go right now hey, yeah, yeah, I got some tips for you jack open up um

2558
06:10:29,099 --> 06:10:35,979
Yeah, you really should get into I mean honestly seriously like whole foods is starting to really take off amazon

2559
06:10:36,060 --> 06:10:38,459
Like you really probably should start to buy a little bit of the amazon stock

2560
06:10:38,779 --> 06:10:42,779
So, uh, once like the big whole foods earnings call happens, uh, you know go up

2561
06:10:42,939 --> 06:10:45,419
Maybe for probably like five ten percent sell it on the next day

2562
06:10:47,069 --> 06:10:49,650
If that doesn't happen

2563
06:10:49,650 --> 06:10:50,689
I

2564
06:10:50,689 --> 06:10:58,740
I've just made an enemy, you know, what if that doesn't happen?

2565
06:11:00,380 --> 06:11:05,360
I did that so I will never tell anybody what they should buy

2566
06:11:06,540 --> 06:11:08,080
investment wise

2567
06:11:08,080 --> 06:11:20,029
Except you know if you were talking about that bitcoin and I still wouldn't

2568
06:11:30,119 --> 06:11:32,400
bitcoin

2569
06:11:32,400 --> 06:11:34,400
Invest in vault going no. Yeah, I

2570
06:11:36,049 --> 06:11:42,610
But long story short, yeah, yeah, I can't I don't want to tell you what to do with your investments. Just do your research

2571
06:11:43,779 --> 06:11:45,779
If you think a company is worth investing in

2572
06:11:46,900 --> 06:11:52,340
Really look into it and see what their plans are on the future see what you what you think they're going to do

2573
06:11:52,340 --> 06:11:54,099
And if you think it's worth it

2574
06:11:54,099 --> 06:11:57,299
Don't let anybody else try to tell you that unless this person

2575
06:11:58,659 --> 06:12:03,779
No, you just can't you can't if you have a financial advisor then you have a stock portfolio then yeah

2576
06:12:03,860 --> 06:12:05,860
Then trust what that person does

2577
06:12:06,340 --> 06:12:09,779
Because you're it's you're that's your financial advisor

2578
06:12:10,580 --> 06:12:12,580
Not the guy on the subway

2579
06:12:13,299 --> 06:12:23,380
You understand?

2580
06:12:23,380 --> 06:12:26,110

2588
06:13:01,459 --> 06:13:03,459
Depending on what my work schedule will look like

2589
06:13:03,779 --> 06:13:06,259
Maybe they'll let me listen to them while I stack boxes

2590
06:13:06,819 --> 06:13:08,419
Let's cross our fingers

2591
06:13:08,419 --> 06:13:10,659

06:13:35,169 --> 06:13:37,729
but if not then

And I wink

2618
06:14:46,639 --> 06:14:58,110
And then the stream turns off

2619
06:14:58,110 --> 06:15:03,139
And I lie in bed and I look at the ceiling

2620
06:15:03,860 --> 06:15:06,669

The old ren and stimpies they tried to bring it back and it was just a disaster

06:16:38,380 --> 06:16:40,380
The original ren and stimpy

2637
06:16:42,619 --> 06:16:51,009

2658
06:19:00,060 --> 06:19:03,500
I lost my appetite for a few days, but I couldn't get over the taste out of my mouth

It's disgusting

2665
06:19:22,159 --> 06:19:24,479
It is not appealing at all

2666
06:19:25,520 --> 06:19:27,119
it's just

2667
06:19:27,119 --> 06:19:28,639

2668
06:19:28,639 --> 06:19:34,750

06:19:57,009 --> 06:19:59,009
You know like you gotta do what you gotta do

2675
06:20:01,180 --> 06:20:03,340
Hold, you know as well drinking it that makes it worse for me

2676
06:20:04,060 --> 06:20:05,979
because my brain

2677
06:20:05,979 --> 06:20:07,979
dials up a thousand percent

2678
06:20:08,459 --> 06:20:11,180

06:21:32,619 --> 06:21:38,939
And eat it if you want to add a little bit you maybe you know, sometimes if you want to get a little

2701
06:21:39,900 --> 06:21:43,340
A little fun with it. You can add like a scoop of vanilla ice cream

2702
06:21:44,580 --> 06:21:46,580
You could add a scoop of chocolate ice cream

2703
06:21:46,900 --> 06:21:48,900
You could add a

2704
06:21:49,060 --> 06:21:51,139
little bit of your favorite

2705
06:21:52,099 --> 06:21:55,060
Other like strawberries, maybe you could add like a couple of strawberries

2706
06:21:55,700 --> 06:22:03,459
Maybe some yogurt somebody said that sounds disgusting. It's really difficult for me not not to ban you permanently from the channel

2707
06:22:04,689 --> 06:22:08,529
I mean like i'm hovering and I it's i've never done that before but that's

2708
06:22:10,240 --> 06:22:13,119
It's close

2709
06:22:13,119 --> 06:22:19,819
Saved you. Okay, just make banana bread if you've never had it before

2710
06:22:20,540 --> 06:22:22,639
I would like you to not

2711
06:22:22,639 --> 06:22:25,259
Talk smack about it until you eat it

2712
06:22:25,919 --> 06:22:31,680
It is the most intensely delicious banana ice cream and it's not even ice cream

2713
06:22:35,299 --> 06:22:37,299
It's so much better for you, too

2714
06:22:37,540 --> 06:22:44,049
Can you repeat repeat the instructions? I wasn't listening. Well, that's unfortunate because

2715
06:22:45,009 --> 06:22:52,240
You should have listened to the tutorial germa. Why didn't you why didn't you know that f was open door?

2716
06:22:57,599 --> 06:23:03,299
Why weren't you paying attention germa?

2717
06:23:03,619 --> 06:23:05,619
He hates us

2718
06:23:08,049 --> 06:23:13,549
Okay

2719
06:23:14,110 --> 06:23:16,110
Let's keep going. We only got a little bit more to do

2720
06:23:17,150 --> 06:23:18,509
but anyways, uh

2721
06:23:18,509 --> 06:23:22,110
Six bananas chop chop chop chop chop make sure they're ripe freeze them

2722
06:23:23,709 --> 06:23:25,549
Take them out of the freezer when they're done about

2723
06:23:25,549 --> 06:23:28,830
Three to two to four of some with three or four hours depending on your freezer

2724
06:23:28,830 --> 06:23:32,430
I don't know how powerful it is. You might have like a blast chiller. I don't know that

2725
06:23:33,389 --> 06:23:35,229
I don't even have one of those

2726
06:23:35,229 --> 06:23:38,880
Don't put it in there. Uh, but if you I don't know why I even brought that up

2727
06:23:39,279 --> 06:23:43,279
Three or four hours in the freezer take them out put them in the blender blend it up until completely smooth

2728
06:23:43,279 --> 06:23:46,479
No chunky bullshit wait till it's smooth. It might take a little while

2729
06:23:48,049 --> 06:23:51,569
Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream if you feel like it you don't have to this is on you

2730
06:23:52,049 --> 06:23:54,849
Add a scoop of chocolate ice cream if you feel like it that's on you not on me

2731
06:23:55,569 --> 06:23:57,569
add whoa

2732
06:23:58,029 --> 06:24:00,909
Add two or three full tablespoon like

2733
06:24:02,110 --> 06:24:04,750
Of peanut butter

2734
06:24:04,750 --> 06:24:12,049
Blend it up. There you go. Done. I want that's that's your homework for the next day

2735
06:24:13,500 --> 06:24:15,500
I want all of you to have a banana

2736
06:24:15,900 --> 06:24:19,900
a whipped up frozen banana with maybe a little bit of peanut butter in it

2737
06:24:20,720 --> 06:24:23,439
or a little bit of uh, like vanilla or chocolate ice cream or just

2738
06:24:24,240 --> 06:24:27,840
Just straight up and I want you to come back and we want to I want to discuss this. It's your homework

2739
06:24:33,139 --> 06:24:38,900
Eat six. No, not you don't eat six bananas in one sitting. That's just to make enough to eat it a few times

2740
06:24:42,139 --> 06:24:45,419
I'm gonna make it and i'm gonna show it to you on stream and I want us all to show it

2741
06:24:45,979 --> 06:24:50,450
at the same time

2742
06:24:50,450 --> 06:24:51,970
but anyways

2743
06:24:51,970 --> 06:24:55,169
Uh s10w update. Thank you slow update for the 250

2744
06:24:55,810 --> 06:25:00,580
Hey germa back again to wish you a happy halloween. Unfortunately last stream I caught was the carnival

2745
06:25:01,060 --> 06:25:05,299
Which by the way is my favorite stream ever now, but I couldn't watch it because of work and stuff

2746
06:25:05,619 --> 06:25:07,700
But i'm happy to say i'm back to donating and supporting you

2747
06:25:08,340 --> 06:25:11,380
Peace and love peace and love ps. What's your favorite horror game?

2748
06:25:12,020 --> 06:25:13,459
Just asking

2749
06:25:13,459 --> 06:25:22,209
Probably outlast or resident evil 2 or the first six hours of resident evil 7

2750
06:25:24,860 --> 06:25:32,110
Something like that

2751
06:25:32,110 --> 06:25:34,500
resident evil 4

2752
06:25:34,500 --> 06:25:37,860
Didn't scare me as much as resident evil 2

2753
06:25:38,830 --> 06:25:48,139
Did especially the remake and we're talking straight up scary how what's my favorite horror like how what there's a couple of criteria there?

2754
06:25:48,700 --> 06:25:58,080
Yeah, resident evil is not that scary. There's a few times in resident evil the the regenerator the regenerators

2755
06:25:59,500 --> 06:26:01,740
Were terrifying the first few times you see them

2756
06:26:04,369 --> 06:26:06,369
In fact, I would put the regenerators up

2757
06:26:06,849 --> 06:26:10,770
As some of the scariest enemies I think i've played that were in a game

2758
06:26:14,610 --> 06:26:19,490
Number one the number one scariest enemy the most intensely terrifying

2759
06:26:20,529 --> 06:26:22,860
enemy experience

2760
06:26:22,860 --> 06:26:26,689
Has to be misdirected. It has to be at this point

2761
06:26:29,900 --> 06:26:33,220
it just was

2762
06:26:33,220 --> 06:26:35,220
just the stress

2763
06:26:37,060 --> 06:26:40,580
and the the walking around and the fact that

2764
06:26:41,540 --> 06:26:43,540
Because a lot of scenarios like that

2765
06:26:44,189 --> 06:26:48,590
It happens for a little bit and then you don't see them anymore. It doesn't happen anymore

2766
06:26:50,819 --> 06:26:56,180
It's a thing that happens for a 30 minute period during the course of the game

2767
06:26:58,209 --> 06:27:03,900
That motherfucker

2768
06:27:03,900 --> 06:27:06,580
does not

2769
06:27:06,580 --> 06:27:11,659
Leave you the fuck alone

2770
06:27:11,659 --> 06:27:14,419
It's horrible

2771
06:27:14,419 --> 06:27:23,619
It's so stressful and so scary and just design wise. He's just a really interesting designed character

2772
06:27:24,020 --> 06:27:27,299
I mean just like it's just a huge guy. It's just a huge guy

2773
06:27:28,259 --> 06:27:29,299
with a

2774
06:27:29,299 --> 06:27:33,099
little top hat on and an overcoat so

2775
06:27:33,819 --> 06:27:38,779
It's cool. But yeah

2776
06:27:38,779 --> 06:27:42,220
I actually think that resident evil 2 we're getting close here to the end of the year

2777
06:27:43,200 --> 06:27:45,200
Resident evil 2 might be the best game of the year

2778
06:27:48,529 --> 06:27:50,770
Yeah, I think so. It's gonna be close

2779
06:27:53,869 --> 06:27:55,869
Sekiro, I wouldn't put sekiro there

2780
06:27:59,659 --> 06:28:02,659
At least for me

2781
06:28:02,659 --> 06:28:04,959
I would put sekiro somewhere

2782
06:28:04,959 --> 06:28:09,889
Probably in the top like five

2783
06:28:09,889 --> 06:28:16,610
But I think uh, I think resident evil 2 is the best game i've played this year in regards to just total like the whole thing

2784
06:28:22,639 --> 06:28:23,919
goose game

2785
06:28:23,919 --> 06:28:27,520
That's funny you say that because I probably would put that somewhere in the top like five or top ten

2786
06:28:30,180 --> 06:28:31,779
What came out this year?

2787
06:28:31,779 --> 06:28:37,099
Let me think what like came out this year like actual games that released this year

2788
06:28:37,819 --> 06:28:49,709
Came out this year

2789
06:28:49,709 --> 06:28:52,110
Smash came out, but I wouldn't put that up

2790
06:28:53,470 --> 06:28:57,790
It was cool. It was good, but I don't kingdom hearts 3 I didn't even play it like I don't want to

2791
06:28:58,669 --> 06:29:05,279
Let's see

2792
06:29:05,279 --> 06:29:09,119
Kingdom hearts 3

2793
06:29:10,860 --> 06:29:12,860
Crackdown to 3

2794
06:29:14,130 --> 06:29:20,209
Anthem which I know metro exodus. I didn't play it devil may cry 5. I want to play it

2795
06:29:24,529 --> 06:29:26,529
Sekiro mortal kombat 11

2796
06:29:26,849 --> 06:29:30,110
Didn't play it

2797
06:29:30,110 --> 06:29:38,369
Control didn't play it

2798
06:29:38,369 --> 06:29:40,369
It's it's it's resident evil 2

2799
06:29:41,090 --> 06:29:43,090
And unless something else comes out, I think

2800
06:29:43,650 --> 06:29:48,060
What came out for nintendo?

2801
06:29:49,459 --> 06:29:58,939
Mario maker 2

2802
06:29:58,939 --> 06:30:00,939
Death stranding is coming out. Yeah

2803
06:30:01,900 --> 06:30:13,229
Let's see what else even really even like indie wise let me think of what I

2804
06:30:14,270 --> 06:30:16,029
You know what I have what I do

2805
06:30:16,029 --> 06:30:17,470
I have to go

2806
06:30:17,470 --> 06:30:19,310
Anytime that there's like an end of the year scenario

2807
06:30:19,310 --> 06:30:21,869
It's like what what did I actually really like at the end of the year?

2808
06:30:22,270 --> 06:30:25,549
I go back to my steam purchase history and go to the year

2809
06:30:26,430 --> 06:30:28,430
And then look at what what I played

2810
06:30:34,819 --> 06:30:37,340
Yeah, it's resident evil 2

2811
06:30:37,340 --> 06:30:44,880
at least now

2812
06:30:44,880 --> 06:30:47,229
big spender

2813
06:30:47,229 --> 06:30:51,330
No, it's that I just want to I just need to remind myself what I bought in 2019

2814
06:30:54,610 --> 06:31:00,529
And please do hey do do not criticize my steam spending habits all of us

2815
06:31:01,790 --> 06:31:05,709
Almost everybody in this channel right now is like addicted to steam

2816
06:31:06,430 --> 06:31:12,159
And buying steam games is everybody here. Maybe some of you don't

2817
06:31:13,869 --> 06:31:16,830
I've been I have like I think I have

2818
06:31:17,389 --> 06:31:20,080
I don't even know how many games I have i've had

2819
06:31:21,090 --> 06:31:23,169
I'm trying to think I maybe okay. I could look

2820
06:31:25,569 --> 06:31:28,689
Every steam sale that happens people just buy them

2821
06:31:29,490 --> 06:31:31,259
You just do

2822
06:31:31,259 --> 06:31:40,180
That's how it was and that's how it will be when they even now but they used to do

2823
06:31:41,470 --> 06:31:45,229
Five years ago. It was a big deal when a game was 75% off

2824
06:31:45,790 --> 06:31:50,779
Oh there. There's a bundle. Here's the entire ubisoft bundle. It's

2825
06:31:51,400 --> 06:31:53,400
75% off. It's normally like

2826
06:31:54,439 --> 06:31:56,740
165 dollars

2827
06:31:56,740 --> 06:32:02,240
Okay, I guess i'll own every single ubisoft game

2828
06:32:04,240 --> 06:32:09,889
I guess

2829
06:32:09,889 --> 06:32:13,889
You buy games. You don't even play them that I have not done that for very very many ago

2830
06:32:20,610 --> 06:32:25,650
most of the I would say almost all of the games that i've purchased they're games that i've wanted to play

2831
06:32:26,290 --> 06:32:27,970
and even if they weren't

2832
06:32:27,970 --> 06:32:33,490
They're games that I eventually did for at least enough time to understand if I really cared about it

2833
06:32:38,020 --> 06:32:40,740
I get bored of games like halfway through that happens to me all the time, too

2834
06:32:41,220 --> 06:32:48,299
You know a lot of you guys will ask like oh, how come you won't stream a game more than three four or five times

2835
06:32:49,630 --> 06:32:52,990
It's because that I don't really play very very many games

2836
06:32:53,790 --> 06:32:56,750
For more than like three four or five sessions

2837
06:32:57,779 --> 06:33:02,020
It's not really necessarily a stream thing like well, I don't want the view counts to drop

2838
06:33:02,909 --> 06:33:05,060
No, it's more of

2839
06:33:05,060 --> 06:33:09,090
It's I lose attention on stuff more than halfway through

2840
06:33:15,740 --> 06:33:19,099
That's why playing games like uh back in the day like playing tf2

2841
06:33:19,580 --> 06:33:22,860
And playing diablo 2 and some of these other games that I was obsessed with

2842
06:33:23,919 --> 06:33:28,240
It didn't matter how much time you spent you could play it for an hour or you could play it for 10

2843
06:33:28,639 --> 06:33:30,639
It didn't matter you're gonna play it regardless

2844
06:33:36,049 --> 06:33:38,130
And they had a game has not really come along

2845
06:33:39,009 --> 06:33:41,250
That has done that to me

2846
06:33:41,810 --> 06:33:47,009
Where oh i'm just gonna turn it on for like two hours and that's I just that's what I want to do today

2847
06:33:47,650 --> 06:33:58,240
That's not really happening. And I think that one of the reasons why is because a lot of that

2848
06:33:59,040 --> 06:34:02,639
Has a lot of those markets have kind of turned into

2849
06:34:04,419 --> 06:34:08,340
Like br markets like a lot like fortnite apex and I just don't

2850
06:34:09,569 --> 06:34:13,009
I don't really care about those games. They don't do it for me at all

2851
06:34:24,099 --> 06:34:29,779
I can understand why br is an interesting experience. I just cannot stomach it. I just can't do it

2852
06:34:32,740 --> 06:34:35,139
German won't even give a no to stalker

2853
06:34:36,700 --> 06:34:38,700
What is with the stalker thing?

2854
06:34:42,159 --> 06:34:45,439
I played like I played stalker what a call of prep yet

2855
06:34:45,439 --> 06:34:48,880
I played it for like a stream or two and then I like it was like three years ago

2856
06:34:52,509 --> 06:34:54,990
God damn it. Like is he ever gonna finish stalker?

2857
06:34:56,080 --> 06:34:59,040
We haven't seen a stalker episode in three years

2858
06:35:01,299 --> 06:35:03,380
It's been a long time. That's even that's back

2859
06:35:04,020 --> 06:35:06,259
Like I've been I was living in massachusetts still

2860
06:35:11,419 --> 06:35:13,580
He's not gonna play tony hawks pro skater

2861
06:35:14,139 --> 06:35:18,860
Yeah, but that's just kind of how I play games anyways, too

2862
06:35:19,659 --> 06:35:25,340
I'll get it when I play a game

2863
06:35:26,060 --> 06:35:32,029
This is how you guys know that I actually like something like really like a game

2864
06:35:33,549 --> 06:35:34,740
Really?

2865
06:35:34,740 --> 06:35:37,380
I oh that was kind of fun. Oh, this is kind of interesting

2866
06:35:37,939 --> 06:35:41,779
No, no, no, like truly enjoy and fully appreciate a video game

2867
06:35:43,810 --> 06:35:51,419
If I want to finish it on stream because that means I really just want to play it

2868
06:35:52,220 --> 06:35:53,889
and

2869
06:35:53,889 --> 06:35:57,569
I want to I have I live stream don't I?

2870
06:36:05,139 --> 06:36:07,139
lifeline clock tower three

2871
06:36:08,529 --> 06:36:11,729
Yeah, all right. Hold on. There's a couple of variables here though

2872
06:36:13,389 --> 06:36:15,549
Sometimes you just have to get to the end

2873
06:36:16,110 --> 06:36:23,169
Because you have to

2874
06:36:23,169 --> 06:36:28,799
There's no other reason I was not going to see

2875
06:36:30,080 --> 06:36:33,599
After the first six seven eight hours of clock tower three

2876
06:36:35,700 --> 06:36:37,700
I was not going to turn that stream off

2877
06:36:39,119 --> 06:36:46,500
And then turn on clock tower three again. I knew it so we had to see it through that night

2878
06:36:46,900 --> 06:36:54,380
He's playing it out of obligation

2879
06:36:54,860 --> 06:36:57,900
Well obligation to knee I want needing to see

2880
06:36:58,619 --> 06:37:02,779
How it ends because I know that I will not go back to it. It'll come out of the playstation 2

2881
06:37:03,340 --> 06:37:07,419
It'll go in a box and then it'll turn into one of those scenarios where oh, yeah, I guess um

2882
06:37:08,139 --> 06:37:11,659
Yeah, I did finish clock tower three and sometimes maybe sometime. I don't know

2883
06:37:12,459 --> 06:37:14,909
I'm gonna clock tower three and uh find a way

2884
06:37:15,630 --> 06:37:17,790
You know scary monsters and try to get away from it

2885
06:37:20,459 --> 06:37:22,459
I mean, maybe maybe one day

2886
06:37:23,409 --> 06:37:28,209
Get scared of them. Maybe

2887
06:37:28,209 --> 06:37:35,580
No, I i'm not gonna go back to it. So I had to do you have to do it sometimes but

2500 bits

2922
06:40:05,220 --> 06:40:11,919
25 dollars. Thank you. Hey germa been watching you for about six years or so. I just recently took a big exam

2923
06:40:12,720 --> 06:40:14,880
Think uh, like cpa exams

2924
06:40:16,740 --> 06:40:19,779
And in the middle of the testing area, which is dead silent

2925
06:40:19,860 --> 06:40:25,299
I started thinking of the greedy grinner and your no emotion bit and burst into laughter

2926
06:40:26,180 --> 06:40:28,740
They kicked me out and I failed the exam

2927
06:40:29,459 --> 06:40:35,569
No, they say unsubscribed that's not good

2928
06:40:41,220 --> 06:40:45,299
That kind of reminds me that reminds me of a story

2929
06:40:46,369 --> 06:40:51,569
That reminds me of a nice long winded story that i'm gonna go on up on here

2930
06:40:54,060 --> 06:41:00,340
One time I took a picture. No, no, just listen to me one time. I took a picture

2931
06:41:01,790 --> 06:41:05,790
Of my friend. We were he was in the back seat. We were on a road trip

2932
06:41:06,830 --> 06:41:09,709
And he was sleeping

2933
06:41:09,709 --> 06:41:13,069
and I just took a picture of his sleeping face because

2934
06:41:13,630 --> 06:41:15,630
He was snoring really loudly

2935
06:41:16,509 --> 06:41:22,540
and it was like, oh my god, why is he sleeping so loudly and

2936
06:41:23,950 --> 06:41:26,430
I just took he was just like his mouth

2937
06:41:27,779 --> 06:41:29,779
His mouth was just open

2938
06:41:30,020 --> 06:41:34,259
and his like eyes it looked just like insane so

2939
06:41:36,459 --> 06:41:40,639
Eventually, he he woke up and we looked he was I was like look at how he was sleeping

2940
06:41:40,639 --> 06:41:42,639
He was like, oh shit like what the fuck

2941
06:41:43,900 --> 06:41:51,069
And seriously for the next week for the next week. I was at the grocery store

2942
06:41:52,159 --> 06:41:53,520
I was

2943
06:41:53,520 --> 06:41:55,119
Driving around

2944
06:41:55,119 --> 06:41:58,400
And I would just see the image of him his face

2945
06:41:59,119 --> 06:42:03,360
And I would start laughing hysterically. I remember being at the checkout at a grocery store

2946
06:42:04,159 --> 06:42:05,900
and just

2947
06:42:05,900 --> 06:42:13,840
Do decide there's there's no reason for me to think about this image and this is absolutely absolutely like seven or eight days later

2948
06:42:14,000 --> 06:42:16,380
Had to be

2949
06:42:16,380 --> 06:42:18,380
and started laughing

2950
06:42:19,389 --> 06:42:22,540
uncontrollably in the checkout and just kept going

2951
06:42:24,139 --> 06:42:27,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just i'm definitely really funny happened

06:47:24,020 --> 06:47:26,880
Why are you not paying attention to me what are you doing bilbo?

Thank you for sharing that that was great

3004
06:47:44,799 --> 06:47:49,360
And that's the that's the duck that I named it out of all the ducks out of the hundreds of ducks

3005
06:47:51,389 --> 06:47:56,029
That's the best one. This is what you said. That's the the most well-behaved the most lovable the most interesting

3006
06:47:58,700 --> 06:48:00,700
That's pretty good pick. I think

3007
06:48:00,779 --> 06:48:02,619
of millions of ducks

3008
06:48:02,619 --> 06:48:15,360
Keep telling yourself that hey, I don't have to tell myself that somebody else told me that I don't have to tell myself that

3009
06:48:16,779 --> 06:48:32,630
But I will continue to do that in the mirror later on this evening, but thank you though. Seriously. That was uh, anonilous

3010
06:48:36,080 --> 06:48:41,009

Vilemi. Thanks for the thousand bits

3028
06:50:17,950 --> 06:50:21,150
Hey germa, I don't know if you've confirmed this yet. I haven't been able to get to your streams very often

3029
06:50:21,470 --> 06:50:25,200
But is there a set date for the next green screen stream? No

3030
06:50:26,659 --> 06:50:29,220
There's not going to be a set date for it until I start to pull

3031
06:50:30,000 --> 06:50:31,200
um

3032
06:50:31,200 --> 06:50:35,700
Suggestions in a new discord channel and that will happen after halloween

3033
06:50:39,310 --> 06:50:43,630
So after halloween because we already have two channels open right now that people are doing stuff in so

3034
06:50:45,279 --> 06:50:52,000
At some point after halloween, you'll see that channel pop up and that stream is going to happen in november. So

3035
06:50:52,479 --> 06:50:55,610
It'll probably be early

3036
06:50:55,610 --> 06:51:01,639
One of the first or second weeks of november, I would assume but thank you so much

3037
06:51:02,779 --> 06:51:05,259
See 4g. Thanks for the 250 rhythm games means

3038
06:51:06,439 --> 06:51:08,619

3039
06:51:09,840 --> 06:51:11,740

3040
06:51:11,819 --> 06:51:24,290
Wrong, but thanks for the 250 appreciate it. Oh, no jerma pluto

3041
06:51:31,560 --> 06:51:36,439

06:51:38,119 --> 06:51:40,279

3043
06:51:42,540 --> 06:51:44,220

3044
06:51:44,220 --> 06:51:45,849
argnator

3045
06:51:45,849 --> 06:51:47,849
For the 300 bits

3046
06:51:48,009 --> 06:51:53,180
Hey jerma, thanks for playing fear. It's one of my favorite games and you butchered it to near perfection

3047
06:51:54,830 --> 06:51:57,470
I did. All right. I got I walked in a alright. Hold on

3048
06:51:58,540 --> 06:52:01,340
I've walked in a circle like a few times

3049
06:52:02,319 --> 06:52:05,959
And that was it. I did. All right. I did. I did. All right

3050
06:52:06,599 --> 06:52:14,380
It was fun. I didn't come on. Come on. I did fine. I did

3051
06:52:14,860 --> 06:52:23,119
Fun, would you consider getting a perm so you'd be curly? No curly didn't have hair. That's not even what you said

3052
06:52:24,860 --> 06:52:28,380
Uh, thank you. You need there's no bits here. You just wrote that in chat. Thank you

3053
06:52:32,189 --> 06:52:38,840
Why would you read a perm comment, I don't know but no I uh

3054
06:52:40,720 --> 06:52:45,310
It was great. I can see why it's a lot of people's favorite games from

3055
06:52:46,490 --> 06:52:48,279
a while back

3056
06:52:48,279 --> 06:52:52,520
Hey, I it probably would be one of mine too if I played it 10 15 years ago

3057
06:52:53,659 --> 06:52:56,380
I hope your stomach gets an order and your energy can be restored

3058
06:52:56,939 --> 06:53:03,340
So we can get more chunky delicious 15 hour play the whole game. Not a joke clock tower three type streams

3059
06:53:05,419 --> 06:53:09,630
Tell stir to get well soon, too

3060
06:53:09,630 --> 06:53:11,209
Thank you

3061
06:53:11,209 --> 06:53:12,919
um

3062
06:53:12,919 --> 06:53:16,919
I mean dark wood the last dark wood stream was almost 12 hours

3063
06:53:18,750 --> 06:53:36,110
I started to lose my fucking mind at the end of that one doing more this

3064
06:53:37,069 --> 06:53:44,189
Doing more than 12 15 hour streams. I they they they kill me. I can't do them

3065
06:53:46,569 --> 06:53:48,569
I can't

3066
06:53:48,569 --> 06:53:50,569
Sometimes you can do

3067
06:53:50,889 --> 06:53:52,889
I don't know how people do it. I really don't

3068
06:53:55,630 --> 06:53:59,630
Trap joke grenade joke fall joke dying joke pretending joke

3069
06:54:03,580 --> 06:54:06,700
Uh, why is why do people think that I'm pretending?

3070
06:54:10,009 --> 06:54:15,369
I'm for days pretending like, you know how difficult it would be to pretend to do all that shit

3071
06:54:16,169 --> 06:54:21,020
It would take like three times the amount of work

3072
06:54:21,580 --> 06:54:24,139
to pretend

3073
06:54:24,200 --> 06:54:26,200
Pretending not to pretend

3074
06:54:26,220 --> 06:54:35,259
Can you imagine setting up elaborate ways for you to step in like bear traps and that's what you're doing

3075
06:54:37,950 --> 06:54:39,950
imagine like falling off a cliff like

3076
06:54:40,590 --> 06:54:42,990
And pretending to do that more than like five times

3077
06:54:43,709 --> 06:54:55,520
Can you imagine lul? Yeah, this is phil jokes. No

3078
06:54:56,779 --> 06:55:01,119
No, it's it's called not paying attention to my surroundings

3079
06:55:04,060 --> 06:55:06,430
I should I should get

3080
06:55:06,509 --> 06:55:17,099
like my old guidance counselor from like the fucking ninth grade on the phone and ask them a few questions

3081
06:55:26,909 --> 06:55:28,909
Do you think it would be odd if I were to?

3082
06:55:29,630 --> 06:55:31,630
Put down something and then forget I put it down

3083
06:55:33,360 --> 06:55:39,740
No, no, in fact, uh, we had to give you a pen every day because you would bring a pen to school

3084
06:55:41,180 --> 06:55:43,180
And you would not leave the

3085
06:55:43,180 --> 06:55:45,180
You would not leave school with a with a pen

3086
06:55:47,400 --> 06:55:50,779
I've lost books before guys. I've lost textbooks

3087
06:55:51,400 --> 06:56:01,849
Teachers would give me stuff and I just wouldn't it would never come back. Oh, yeah

3088
06:56:01,849 --> 06:56:04,810
I'm gonna get along. I'm gonna loan you this pen. I want this one back. Okay

3089
06:56:05,610 --> 06:56:10,799
I don't have it. Where'd it go? I don't know

3090
06:56:12,119 --> 06:56:15,080
Where where is the pen? I don't know

3091
06:56:16,060 --> 06:56:19,099
I don't have

3092
06:56:19,099 --> 06:56:24,110
Okay. Well, here's another one. Don't lose this one

3093
06:56:24,750 --> 06:56:35,340
Thanks. I don't have it anymore. I just handed you the pen. I don't know. I just gave it to you

3094
06:56:36,349 --> 06:56:39,840
Did you eat it?

3095
06:56:39,840 --> 06:56:46,430
Maybe and then I like smile

3096
06:56:46,909 --> 06:56:48,909
And I got a bunch of like wood in my teeth

3097
06:56:51,000 --> 06:56:52,680
And then we got to commercial

3098
06:56:52,680 --> 06:56:54,680
Oh, well, that would be a funny show

3099
06:56:54,759 --> 06:56:56,860
if you call like

3100
06:56:56,860 --> 06:57:10,240
Jerma just doesn't get it

3101
06:57:10,240 --> 06:57:12,240
Everybody hates jerma

3102
06:57:15,229 --> 06:57:17,130
bad pilot

3103
06:57:17,130 --> 06:57:24,729
Bad pilot he said did you say bad pilot? Did you guys know that young sheldon exists as a television show?

3104
06:57:30,590 --> 06:57:32,669
That makes 500 fucking million dollars

3105
06:57:44,509 --> 06:57:47,310
Wait, wait, wait a minute. It's not it's not about making a good show

3106
06:57:52,439 --> 06:57:54,439
It would be about making as much money

3107
06:57:55,319 --> 06:58:04,799
as possible

3108
06:58:04,880 --> 06:58:07,840
Yeah, you should see you should see the huge

3109
06:58:08,400 --> 06:58:19,529
Grin I got right now. Did he just call out big bang theory?

3110
06:58:22,110 --> 06:58:25,759
No, no, I called out

3111
06:58:26,430 --> 06:58:44,299
Almost all network television at the same time cut his mic. How original

3112
06:58:44,860 --> 06:58:50,509
Jerma is big bang tier comedy

3113
06:58:52,680 --> 06:58:57,560
Here's the difference though. Uh, I don't I don't pump in audience members

3114
06:59:01,930 --> 06:59:03,930
Okay, if you want to go that far

3115
06:59:04,779 --> 06:59:09,020
That means that you that means that you've left at the big bang theory then

3116
06:59:10,009 --> 06:59:12,810
Oh, wait, wait, wait, we can't have that. We can't have that

3117
06:59:16,299 --> 06:59:29,200
Oh, oh

3118
06:59:29,200 --> 06:59:32,599
Big bang theory sucks. You know, actually

3119
06:59:33,400 --> 06:59:35,400
An old college professor told me one time

3120
06:59:36,040 --> 06:59:38,279
That saying that something sucks

3121
06:59:38,279 --> 06:59:39,000
is

3122
06:59:39,000 --> 06:59:41,000
You can't ever say something sucks

3123
06:59:43,080 --> 06:59:45,080
If it if it makes

3124
06:59:45,560 --> 06:59:47,400
that much money

3125
06:59:47,400 --> 06:59:49,400
Because that means that more people

3126
06:59:50,119 --> 06:59:52,639
Think it does not

3127
06:59:52,639 --> 06:59:54,639
But then think it does

3128
06:59:56,970 --> 06:59:58,970
Your professor sucks

3129
06:59:58,970 --> 07:00:03,580
Yeah

3130
07:00:10,860 --> 07:00:14,380
Popularity does not equal quality. No, it doesn't but uh, but I mean

3131
07:00:16,830 --> 07:00:18,830
Yeah, now that I think about it that guy

3132
07:00:19,849 --> 07:00:23,930
Yeah, that guy that guy was only my professor for like six months and he had replaced

3133
07:00:26,439 --> 07:00:36,700
shit

3134
07:00:36,700 --> 07:00:39,580
I'm kidding. All right. All right. No, i'm not i'm not fucking around

3135
07:00:41,520 --> 07:00:44,880
I love fucking around but we've got a job to do

3136
07:00:54,680 --> 07:00:56,919
Play fear 2 right now. Why would I do that?

3137
07:00:57,930 --> 07:00:59,930
All right, that's it. Let's get the credits on

3138
07:01:01,580 --> 07:01:03,580
I'll see you guys on uh

3139
07:01:05,439 --> 07:01:07,819

3140
07:01:07,819 --> 07:01:09,340

3141
07:01:09,340 --> 07:01:12,599
Here comes the credits. Thanks for subbing everybody

3142
07:01:14,169 --> 07:01:16,169
Appreciate all the support as always

3143
07:01:16,569 --> 07:01:19,040
The stream gets a lot of it. So thank you. Seriously

3144
07:01:20,459 --> 07:01:22,939
We fuck around a lot. I talk a lot of

3145
07:01:23,479 --> 07:01:25,479
bullshit all the time

3146
07:01:25,900 --> 07:01:26,860
but

3147
07:01:26,860 --> 07:01:30,119
real real real

3148
07:01:30,119 --> 07:01:32,680
Thank you for continuing to

3149
07:01:33,869 --> 07:01:35,869
Uh, let me live this fucking life

3150
07:01:36,110 --> 07:01:39,500
Each and every one of you. Thank you so much. Seriously

3151
07:01:39,819 --> 07:01:50,250
It means a lot, but while we see that we still have a handful of bits to do

3152
07:01:52,240 --> 07:01:58,639
We had creamy sensation gave 500 bits planning to do anything on halloween. Hope we get to see a lot of monka s moments

3153
07:01:59,580 --> 07:02:01,819
Yes, there's going to be an elaborate halloween stream

3154
07:02:02,880 --> 07:02:06,040
uh

3155
07:02:06,040 --> 07:02:08,040
Probably on halloween day, I would assume

3156
07:02:08,990 --> 07:02:10,990
They will be a halloween stream. Yes

3157
07:02:11,310 --> 07:02:13,150
It's gonna be a lot going on there

3158
07:02:13,150 --> 07:02:15,549
It's gonna be a secret slime action part of that stream

3159
07:02:15,869 --> 07:02:20,349
Go check out the discord go to the secret slime discussion stream so you can see exactly what is going to happen there

3160
07:02:22,919 --> 07:02:28,270
Should be fun, but thank you for the 500 bits. Thank you grump clump for the 300 bits grump clump

3161
07:02:28,909 --> 07:02:30,830

07:02:30,830 --> 07:02:33,150
Can you tell my friend he did a great job on his video?

3163
07:02:35,150 --> 07:02:36,189

07:02:40,080 --> 07:02:41,439
incredible

3167
07:02:41,439 --> 07:02:46,919
Oh, they forgot to link it. Oh

3168
07:02:56,830 --> 07:02:58,729
He just lied

3169
07:02:58,729 --> 07:03:00,729
Well, I didn't say it just

3170
07:03:03,310 --> 07:03:06,669
The message just said hey, can you say that he did a good job on this video?

07:05:01,529 --> 07:05:05,049
Did I lie about that video or was it as a great video? So

3175
07:05:05,770 --> 07:05:08,799
What are you guys talking about?

3176
07:05:08,799 --> 07:05:21,000
What do you mean? I'm not watching the frog compilation. No, everyone was just yelling at me to go to bed

3177
07:05:21,979 --> 07:05:23,979
And hey hurry up and finish the bits

3178
07:05:26,139 --> 07:05:28,139

Why not? Thank you grump clump. Thanks for the 300 bits

3180
07:05:41,180 --> 07:05:44,139
Slow update. Thanks for the 250. Hey jerma just quick update on my last donation

3181
07:05:44,139 --> 07:05:49,340
I was going to donate a lot more until I saw jerma sour and now i'm not only i'm not donating

3182
07:05:49,659 --> 07:05:51,979
But i'm suing for emotional damages

3183
07:05:53,150 --> 07:05:58,400
Uh happy to watch you again. See you next time. You know why that emotes there, right?

3184
07:05:59,709 --> 07:06:05,229
Because I said out loud if that emote was not there within 24 hours, I would do a 24 hour stream

3185
07:06:05,630 --> 07:06:09,389
That emote is only there so I would not have to do a 24 hour stream

3186
07:06:15,709 --> 07:06:18,909
Came pretty close. Yeah, it was about an hour and a half before the stream started that it was there

3187
07:06:21,849 --> 07:06:25,770
Smelly boy. Thanks for the 250. Hi jerma been loving your content so far this spooky season

3188
07:06:25,770 --> 07:06:31,770
My question is you ever been in the shower looked up towards the nozzle and just let a bunch of water fill your mouth for no

3189
07:06:31,849 --> 07:06:39,319
Reason and spit it out all the time. Yeah

3190
07:06:39,799 --> 07:06:47,119
I mean that that happens at least two or three times

3191
07:06:47,840 --> 07:06:51,900
I was gonna say a stream that happens two or three times a shower without a doubt

3192
07:06:56,400 --> 07:07:00,560
And my favorite part is you know, you do that and then you piss in the shower. That's like the best part

3193
07:07:03,229 --> 07:07:08,490
Thanks for the 250

3194
07:07:08,490 --> 07:07:09,930
Thank you water

3195
07:07:09,930 --> 07:07:11,869

07:07:11,869 --> 07:07:18,409
Hey jerma been watching your youtube channel for years first time twitch viewer and I cannot thank you enough for all the laughs

longtime fan water

3200
07:07:29,770 --> 07:07:40,080
Thank you. Welcome to the twitch channel. I still have as much fun as I did

3201
07:07:40,720 --> 07:07:48,439
Here at the same amount that I had on the youtube channel. I have a lot of fun

3202
07:07:49,340 --> 07:07:54,459
Thank you so much for the 1500 bits and thanks for hanging out and I need to just quickly turn to the chat and then just say

3203
07:07:54,939 --> 07:07:55,979
that

3204
07:07:55,979 --> 07:07:57,419
peeing in the shower

3205
07:07:57,419 --> 07:07:59,740
Is one of those weird things that everybody says

3206
07:08:00,220 --> 07:08:07,419
It talks shit about and says that's ridiculous unbelievable what the fucking god disgusting what a psycho

3207
07:08:08,139 --> 07:08:10,139
And you do it every single day

3208
07:08:10,619 --> 07:08:12,860
I don't know why people are like this

3209
07:08:14,240 --> 07:08:16,240
Is there a reason why people?

3210
07:08:16,380 --> 07:08:17,689
pretend

3211
07:08:17,689 --> 07:08:21,130
that they do not pee in the shower is it's one of those things that people just

3212
07:08:24,810 --> 07:08:31,770
You're disgusting. You're gross and then you're like groggy in the morning and you just look down and you're just like pee into the drain

3213
07:08:32,680 --> 07:08:54,270
Nobody knows I did that but me it's just pipes. What's the difference? What do you mean? How does it smell?

3214
07:08:55,840 --> 07:08:57,680
You don't look

3215
07:08:57,680 --> 07:09:02,110
You don't you don't pee into a hot shower

3216
07:09:03,610 --> 07:09:05,610
You open up the door

3217
07:09:06,810 --> 07:09:08,810
You turn the shower on

3218
07:09:09,150 --> 07:09:11,389
And you pee into the shower

3219
07:09:23,319 --> 07:09:29,069
Okay, my stomach hurts there's a perfectly good toilet right behind you

3220
07:09:30,029 --> 07:09:34,509
But you don't give a shit for some reason

3221
07:09:47,419 --> 07:09:50,110
Oh

3222
07:09:50,110 --> 07:09:52,110
No, i'm fucking kidding, but i'm just

3223
07:09:53,500 --> 07:09:55,419
I'm seeing it in my head

3224
07:09:55,419 --> 07:09:58,619
I'm watching the thing i'm saying that i'm conveying is real

3225
07:09:59,099 --> 07:10:03,180
And i'm imagining what you're seeing in your head and it's making me laugh fucking hard

3226
07:10:04,169 --> 07:10:06,810
Because the second I start talking about it, you just people just start

3227
07:10:07,610 --> 07:10:09,290
It's it's I

3228
07:10:09,290 --> 07:10:14,669
What if i'm kidding no, I

3229
07:10:15,470 --> 07:10:24,040
No, I do not pee into the shower from outside the shower. I do it while i'm in there like a normal person

3230
07:10:34,009 --> 07:10:38,169
Define in like i'm talking in you're standing in. All right, we're not gonna even go over this

3231
07:10:38,650 --> 07:10:44,889
Everybody does this shit and everybody pretends like they don't do it and the and like the and like the three of you that actually

3232
07:10:44,889 --> 07:10:48,299
Don't do this

3233
07:10:48,299 --> 07:11:04,279
Good work because you're you're amongst a sea of liars right now. What about the sink? No, no, no, excuse me

3234
07:11:05,840 --> 07:11:15,880
There are lines you didn't know absolutely not why do people pretend that they don't take their shirts off to poo

3235
07:11:16,200 --> 07:11:34,909
That's another mystery. Do you guys okay? No, we're not gonna go here

3236
07:11:34,909 --> 07:11:40,430
But just know that for the longest time I was I used to actually I still kind of do it sometimes

3237
07:11:41,150 --> 07:11:46,380
I completely naked to take a shit like i'm talking not even socks

3238
07:11:55,229 --> 07:11:57,950
You know how difficult it is to go to the bathroom in a public bathroom

3239
07:11:59,319 --> 07:12:03,319
When you have to take off every single article of clothing including your shoes and socks

3240
07:12:04,759 --> 07:12:24,750
It's impossible

3241
07:12:24,750 --> 07:12:28,590
I'm saying I i've never done that. That's too hard

3242
07:12:30,349 --> 07:12:46,159
Uh, what the fuck is happening? Why is the credits?

3243
07:12:49,419 --> 07:12:50,750
Okay

3244
07:12:50,750 --> 07:12:53,560
uh

3245
07:12:53,560 --> 07:12:57,720
Can you imagine walking into like a public bathroom and you go into like wash your hands?

3246
07:12:58,040 --> 07:13:02,040
And you see like draped over the top of the stall like a shirt

3247
07:13:02,599 --> 07:13:07,000
Pants underwear socks and the shit and the guy's shoes are out in front of the stall

3248
07:13:10,000 --> 07:13:12,000
What the fuck is going on in here

3249
07:13:30,169 --> 07:13:36,029
God, all right. Let's get out of here. Thanks everybody

3250
07:13:37,020 --> 07:13:39,020
Oh fuck. I closed the website

3251
07:13:39,919 --> 07:13:42,639
I closed the website because do people still call them websites?

3252
07:13:43,279 --> 07:13:47,819
But you just say like I closed my tab or my site. Do you say website still?

3253
07:13:54,380 --> 07:13:55,819
There's no cool

3254
07:13:55,819 --> 07:13:58,599
New way to say that

3255
07:13:58,599 --> 07:14:03,450
Window. Yeah, there you go. You close the window. You don't close the website. You close the window

3256
07:14:10,240 --> 07:14:16,619
All right, let's finish this

3257
07:14:16,619 --> 07:14:18,569
Thanks for sticking around

3258
07:14:18,569 --> 07:14:20,650
We have

3259
07:14:20,650 --> 07:14:26,060
Uh, just a couple more to do. Thank you. Havegun for the 250. Hey germa

3260
07:14:26,060 --> 07:14:29,740
If you ever if you enjoyed sphere you might want to give a shogo

3261
07:14:30,700 --> 07:14:35,419
Mobile armor division a look. It's pretty fun 90s shooter by monolith monolith made a lot of great games

3262
07:14:35,900 --> 07:14:44,729
I wonder what they're doing now after shadow war. Thank you. Vilemi for the

3263
07:14:45,830 --> 07:14:53,240
2000 bits. Thank you 20 bucks here total. I'm not addicted to buying games. I'm just addicted to giving germa bits

3264
07:14:55,689 --> 07:14:57,290
You don't have to do that

3265
07:14:57,290 --> 07:15:04,459
But thank you regardless and then they say at this point we really need the germa psycho emote fine

3266
07:15:10,479 --> 07:15:14,000
I don't know the germa psycho emote has has to be that image

3267
07:15:16,279 --> 07:15:18,279
On something. I don't know. I have to find one

3268
07:15:21,119 --> 07:15:23,119
Which face is it going to be? I don't know

3269
07:15:25,259 --> 07:15:27,740
If it's not ready by saturday we get no i'm not doing that again

3270
07:15:28,990 --> 07:15:32,110
But it'll probably be there on saturday, but i'm not giving up. No i'm not doing that

3271
07:15:32,669 --> 07:15:35,549
I could not do a 24-hour stream right now, even if I lost that bet

3272
07:15:36,110 --> 07:15:38,569
I'm too screwed up right now

3273
07:15:38,569 --> 07:15:41,689
On this medication, so i'm actually surprised i'm able to be here for this long

3274
07:15:43,880 --> 07:15:46,439
It's actually because I i've been eating very light today

3275
07:15:46,919 --> 07:15:52,509
That's probably why so this stream was really not supposed to be more than like four or five hours long

3276
07:15:53,130 --> 07:15:56,669
But i've been okay. I felt alright, so i'm cool to hang out

3277
07:16:00,029 --> 07:16:02,759
But they will be one soon

3278
07:16:02,840 --> 07:16:07,000
Finally stefunky chicken. Thanks for the 400 bits. Did you get my other bit message?

3279
07:16:07,000 --> 07:16:13,319
If not, I just said the thing was a tricky game where if you don't manage it correctly, you can soft lock yourself

3280
07:16:14,139 --> 07:16:19,279
It's fun when you know what you're doing, uh plan on two or three save files where

3281
07:16:19,919 --> 07:16:25,720
Two of them get soft locked. I would assume this is the one right here. Let's see

3282
07:16:30,090 --> 07:16:32,090
Yeah, i'll find one some of these are good

3283
07:16:38,490 --> 07:16:41,869
I'll get a good one. I'll get a i'll get a damn good one

3284
07:16:48,700 --> 07:16:51,900
Wait, no now it sounds like I don't think kim is funny

3285
07:16:53,259 --> 07:16:55,040
I like this one

3286
07:16:55,040 --> 07:16:59,229
It'll probably be this one

3287
07:16:59,229 --> 07:17:02,509
Yeah, but that's not this is not even germa psycho

3288
07:17:03,610 --> 07:17:05,610
Look, that's not germa psycho

3289
07:17:06,349 --> 07:17:08,990
That's fucking that's like germa deranged

3290
07:17:10,029 --> 07:17:27,880
That's germa scary. That's not the same thing. I'll find one

3291
07:17:32,490 --> 07:17:34,569
Use the deep fake we'll see

3292
07:17:40,520 --> 07:17:43,099
But that is gonna be it. I'll see you guys later

3293
07:17:47,630 --> 07:17:50,700
Have a fantastic

3294
07:17:50,779 --> 07:17:52,779
Next day. I'll see you guys

3295
07:17:52,860 --> 07:18:00,509
Very soon. What do you mean? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

3296
07:18:01,310 --> 07:18:02,669
What are you waiting for?

3297
07:18:02,669 --> 07:18:10,669
What's the matter? What are we waiting for?

3298
07:18:16,159 --> 07:18:18,599
Okay, you can go. Oh, thanks

3299
07:18:18,599 --> 07:18:21,000
What did kim what's the first thing kim said to me?

3300
07:18:23,709 --> 07:18:25,419
um

3301
07:18:25,419 --> 07:18:31,000
I don't know like

3302
07:18:31,000 --> 07:18:31,959
uh

3303
07:18:31,959 --> 07:18:34,430
She said I was a she said I was a c minus

3304
07:18:47,130 --> 07:18:50,650
Yeah, I remember I was like, oh what would what would you give me for like that? That's not the first thing though. That's like

3305
07:18:51,840 --> 07:18:53,200
and after like a

3306
07:18:53,200 --> 07:18:57,130
maybe like five days four or five days of uh

3307
07:18:58,430 --> 07:19:01,389
Of like hanging out. I was like, what would you give me for like a letter grade?

3308
07:19:01,950 --> 07:19:06,189
And i'm like I I would give you an a like I give you an a

3309
07:19:06,750 --> 07:19:12,520
She's like you get a c minus

3310
07:19:12,520 --> 07:19:16,919
And then wait, whoa, whoa, whoa this story. There's a small little hold on interestingly enough

3311
07:19:18,110 --> 07:19:20,430
After another I mean it was a joke

3312
07:19:20,430 --> 07:19:23,950
It was she was making a joke and I laughed at it because she knows that I think the things are funny

3313
07:19:24,590 --> 07:19:26,110
You know, we laughed

3314
07:19:26,110 --> 07:19:31,709
And then a few weeks later. I asked again. Hey, what was what was that? What that did I increase?

3315
07:19:31,709 --> 07:19:33,709
Mike would my was still beta c minus

3316
07:19:33,869 --> 07:19:35,869
Nope, I went up to a b plus

3317
07:19:38,479 --> 07:19:41,099
and now

3318
07:19:41,099 --> 07:19:42,939
What is it now?

3319
07:19:42,939 --> 07:19:49,400
Kim's here now kim's in the chat. What does it know? I mean like it's it's been three. It's been like almost three years

3320
07:19:49,400 --> 07:20:03,360
What does it know?

3321
07:20:08,939 --> 07:20:17,049
What no

3322
07:20:17,049 --> 07:20:19,869
Come on, you're supposed to say

3323
07:20:19,869 --> 07:20:23,389
You get an a

3324
07:20:23,389 --> 07:20:25,389
You get an a plus

3325
07:20:26,509 --> 07:20:28,509
And then everybody goes oh

3326
07:20:30,060 --> 07:20:34,220
And I go, oh

3327
07:20:34,299 --> 07:20:42,479
I just got dunked on a b a b plus is great

3328
07:20:43,279 --> 07:20:45,279
That means solid

3329
07:20:45,520 --> 07:20:48,270
very good

3330
07:20:48,270 --> 07:20:54,349
Not too good where you're like trying too hard, you know, like a b plus is perfect

3331
07:20:54,430 --> 07:20:56,430
I think b plus is the best grade you could possibly get

3332
07:21:03,799 --> 07:21:17,240
It'd be an a if you weren't bald

3333
07:21:19,450 --> 07:21:22,299
Oh my god

3334
07:21:22,299 --> 07:21:25,819
There's context for what kim just said. Okay, she

3335
07:21:27,630 --> 07:21:34,110
I don't okay. Listen, I gotta I have to I gotta explain this one because I can't leave after that

3336
07:21:34,189 --> 07:21:40,750
Like a bombshell like that one. I don't have any tattoos kim has a lot so

3337
07:21:43,150 --> 07:21:53,689
She was referring to I don't have any tattoos. I want you to get a tattoo and uh, no that's not gonna happen

3338
07:21:54,009 --> 07:21:59,869
The only tattoo I'd ever get would be the fucking venom symbol on my shoulder. I almost got that tattoo by the way

3339
07:22:00,810 --> 07:22:06,250
I was potentially hours from getting the venom symbol across my entire left shoulder

3340
07:22:06,330 --> 07:22:18,680
Thank god, I didn't do that because now i'm gonna get it on my chest where it belongs

3341
07:22:23,389 --> 07:22:25,950
Hey anonymous skifter. Thanks for the five community subs

3342
07:22:26,430 --> 07:22:42,759
