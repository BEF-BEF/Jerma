1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:10,810
Hey everybody. We're gonna try a test. We're gonna try to do it again. Who knows if this

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,929
is gonna be functional or not, but I am, you know, I'm willing to give it a try.

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:25,190
All you can do is try. You guys having a good day? What is today? I've lost all track of time

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:37,530
has been deleted. What is today? Thursday, November 1st. He's, he's, there he is. He's

5
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:48,500
Well, it never really went anywhere, but we've, we've had some solid green

6
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,899
over the last 24 hours. So I figured I would try because we've been dealing with, obviously

7
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:03,539
Cox has been trying to get infrastructurally these problems fixed. And this is the first

8
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,299
time in probably two and a half weeks where we've had internet for more than like four

9
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:13,299
hours straight. So we're green for the moment. Let's see how, this could be 45 minutes or this

10
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:19,900
could be six hours. I don't know. I'm willing to give it an attempt though. And well,

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,140
we will update some information about the green screen stream. So you're gonna have to

12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:34,260
stick around for that. There's some updated info. Here comes a 30 minute stream. All right,

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:02:12,060
give me, give me one second. Also funnily enough, there was, I turned on the PS4

14
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,259
because this is where I was Red Dead 2. And I don't know. I think the, the PS4 must

15
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:24,699
have gone into rest mode because we're at the same screen I was at like four and a half

16
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:33,419
days ago. So we're just here. I don't really remember what I was doing, but I know that I

17
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:44,870
exist here. I got to remember the controls too. This is gonna be fucking hard. Even the game was

18
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:53,340
waiting. Yeah. It's like nothing ever happened. You guys just woke up. We all just woke up.

19
00:02:54,229 --> 00:03:02,550
And we're here four days later. We got 50, 50 bucks right off the bat from Pocket Pauling.

20
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,789
Thanks for the $50 Pocket Pauling. Finally, my dad is back from the war. Hey, Jerma,

21
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:12,550
how sad, relieved are you that you missed the Red Sox parade? Oh yeah, the Red Sox won

22
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,870
the World Series. That's right. That happened. What else has happened in the time that I haven't

23
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,340
been awake? I mean streaming, you know, Red Sox won the World Series. Super Smash Brothers

24
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:39,000
is coming out and they did a direct today. And excuse me. Excuse me. Where's my favorite

25
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,069
fucking character? Excuse me. Plant? Oh, I thought you guys were calling me a plant.

26
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:59,270
Well, I don't want to give any spoilers for people that haven't watched the direct,

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:10,629
but I'm missing somebody real important there, I think. Jerma's a plant. That's right. I'm

28
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:25,620
working. I'm working for him. Minecraft Steve. No, no way. What do you mean I wouldn't let

29
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,519
that happen? I don't work for Nintendo. No, I would never let that happen. This is not like

30
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:35,819
me playing Red Dead right now. What am I talking about? I would like I would talk to somebody.

31
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:46,329
Oh my fucking Jesus. Hold on. Thank you. Thank you. Jabba dab for your 10 community sub.

32
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,040
Thanks a lot, man. Thanks. Also, by the way, pocket Pauling. We didn't really touch upon your

33
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,379
$50 here. Like for real, thank you so much. Pocket Pauling for your 50 bucks and jabba

34
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:05,480
dab for your 10 community subs. And I think we I think we can go. You know what I'm

35
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,620
saying? I think we can just go. I got it. How do you ride the horse? I forget. Here we go.

36
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:21,670
What was I doing? Okay, I'm back in it. Is it x? I forget how to play. Do you just I just

37
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:31,019
woke up from a fucking dream. Okay, stalling. I don't remember how to shoot. I was in the

38
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:37,740
middle of the tutorial and I went into cryogenic sleep to get the train. You want to

39
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,829
head down? See how he's getting on? Okay. No, I remember. Okay, but I'm getting some

40
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:56,420
memories. Check on Bill. That's a gun. Okay. How do I take out the

41
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,389
doctor binocular? What was benign? Was there a binocular button? Do I do I go? Am I going

42
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:19,939
down? You know, I have to leave. I'm holding a knife. L one and R one. There we go. Okay.

43
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:41,990
Let's check on Bill. How's he doing? All right, put him up. Get on the horse.

44
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,750
This is I didn't even get to fucking do this. It's been four and a half days.

45
00:06:46,230 --> 00:07:03,589
No, god damn it. Okay, zoom. Where are you, Bill? This is this what I'm supposed to be doing.

46
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:16,360
Guys, give me a break. There he is. Okay. Where's he on the hill?

47
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:30,870
Okay, there he is. All right, spotted. I gotta I gotta move my horse out of here.

48
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:37,189
Set up the detonator by those rocks over there. Okay, sure. Now just unspool the wire and then

49
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,750
attach it to said detonator. I'm going to explode here. Pick up the spool.

50
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,810
I'm gonna I'm gonna like acme this guy. You're about to get wily coyote.

51
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:12,279
How much slack do we have? All right, here we go. Attach it.

52
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:28,490
This is attach the thing mini game or what? Okay. Okay. All right. Now stomp on detonator.

53
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:43,559
What if I just jump on this? Imagine if it just fucking blew up.

54
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,980
All right, I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Put the horse on the tracks. I just got this

55
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:04,730
horse. Why would I do something like that? I just bought the horse. All right, so I

56
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,690
have to detonate it. So I blow up the train. He says all fine. We'll soon find out.

57
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:18,009
Put yourself on the tracks. I think so. Okay, cover your faces. Train should be here any

58
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:34,470
minute now. Weapon wheel. So now we're looking for the detonator. The light.

59
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,419
I thought I had to like throw the fuse. It's not radio controlled.

60
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:59,320
Gentlemen, it's time. Good luck. All of you. You all know what to do.

61
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,279
I don't know. I actually don't because I saw the first part of this mission and story

62
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:13,620
almost four and a half, five days ago. Here we go. All right, that just didn't work.

63
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,789
Why are we getting off the horses? Wait, why would we get off the horse?

64
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,509
Jump on the train. How am I supposed to do that from here?

65
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:55,740
Okay, I've made it. Oh, running a train. All right, give me a Lenin. Pull, pull him.

66
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,779
Wait, oh, did he fall or did I fall?

67
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:16,059
Come on, this is what it's supposed to be doing, right? What? What am I doing?

68
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:32,230
Okay, I think I figured out what I'm supposed to do. What's the uh, okay.

69
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,940
All right, let's go. Stop the train. It's not TNT barrels here, right?

70
00:11:47,259 --> 00:12:02,889
I like the repeater. I was going for a tackle. All right, quick. I got to need something.

71
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:12,120
Give me some cover. Wait, wait, no, we gotta go. What the fuck?

72
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:17,259
I just got hit in the face with a shovel. Reverse the grapple.

73
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:34,570
Is this Abe Lincoln? All right, give it the front of the engine car.

74
00:12:44,009 --> 00:13:02,519
There's more. Right in the face. I have dead eye, so I don't know why I'm not using it

75
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,220
for some reason. What's the reload button?

76
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,419
Can I get like an ammo toss to me? That's it, right?

77
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:31,220
That guy. I need to pick up stuff on the ground. Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

78
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:47,529
Is that a person in the back? Is that an animal? That's a person. Oh shit. Oh shit. Get behind

79
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:56,330
this little fucking slab. Wait, this is our guys? Oh, these are our guys. All right. Wait,

80
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:07,110
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to. It's a rock. It's a slab. That's a slab. Okay.

81
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,610
Assume yellow tonic to fortify your bars. A fortified bar can be used for a short period

82
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,289
without draining. This tonic will fortify your dead eye. Listen to me. Okay. We don't want to

83
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:34,889
kill any of you. Any more of you. I give you my word, but trust me, we will. Boys,

84
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:48,250
okay. You asked for it. Five, three, two, one. Seems our friends have gone deaf.

85
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,929
I don't, I don't know what the, what the world war two plane sound was coming from outside.

86
00:14:52,649 --> 00:15:06,490
Are we going? I can't rapid fire this time. Mr. Williamson, give Mr. Morgan and Mr. Smith

87
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,539
some dynamite. You two boys go blow that door open. Why don't we do that? Thanks bill.

88
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:20,679
Much to us, but you boys in there might want to take a step back.

89
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,200
Place dynamite. Seems good enough. All right. Here we go. Like the views. Here we go.

90
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:39,419
All right. Now step back. Unless you got a death wish. I'd step back, fellas. Yeah,

91
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:45,590
I did this. I did this. All right. Now go in and just start firing.

92
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:07,500
Blind him. Get on up and search that train. What's the punch button? I want to punch. It's

93
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:17,990
all right. Let's search the damn train. Look at this place. It's like a, it's beautiful in here.

94
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,750
You two got the safe. I'll search the rest. Oh yes. Should be easy as cake.

95
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,950
If I'm going to hide something, I would hide it inside the lamp.

96
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:35,590
Shut up. Me and Arthur did all the work. Yeah, kid did good. Didn't see you rushing to jump on

97
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,509
that train. He's king. I'll give you that. On receipt of funds, we proceed with phases two

98
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,070
and three of the project and present you with a detailed report of our findings within

99
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:47,429
the month. Yours, respectively. Okay, let's see if we can get this open. Now that wasn't part

100
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:57,529
of it. Getting there. What's in there? Cigars? I can't carry any more of this item. I need

101
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:13,319
to sell some shit then. Any codes? No, no codes. You can screenshot that and read it later if you

102
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:20,009
want. All right, there's brandy. I'm going to need to do something eventually here, food wise.

103
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:28,650
Can't carry any more of this item. Why not?

104
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:47,430
Can somebody else hold something? Money? That's money. Those are IOUs. No, it tells you. Bond.

105
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:00,680
Is it really a lockbox if it's unlocked? That's true.

106
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:08,650
What did you find? These. They worth anything? Oh, sure. Bearer bonds. I think we could probably

107
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,970
sell these pretty easily. Oh, wait, is that Ethereum? Well done. Now would you get rid of

108
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:18,650
all of this? The train? Yeah, get it out of here. What about them? What do you think?

109
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,980
I don't know. It's up to you. Kill them, leave them here. Take them with you on the

110
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,460
train. Wait, I get temporary party members? Okay. See you back at camp. What do I do

111
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,859
about these three? We'll be moving on. The rest are you. Let's ride. What do I do with my temporary

112
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:51,059
party? Guard. Deal with the guards. Can I pick who I threaten? Okay. Get on the train. Quick.

113
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:14,599
Wait, I gotta get you too. Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What's going on? What happened?

114
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:21,180
Why did that? What? What's with the boundaries? Why are the boundaries here?

115
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,720
Somebody gave 100 bucks. Mega Mube just gave 100 dollars. Thank you so much, dude. I haven't been

116
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,839
able to watch your stream very much recently, but still love every second of the VODs.

117
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,630
Hope this helps a little with settling into the new place. Thank you. Thank you so much,

118
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,839
Mega Mube. Well, you haven't been able to watch very much recently. I haven't really

119
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:51,259
been able to stream very much recently. So all right, so let's do this the actual way I'm

120
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:58,490
supposed to do it. Okay. Get on the train. Quick. All of you. Any bright ideas? I kill all three.

121
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:10,339
Yeah. Oh, I don't have, I don't have anything else. Well, I want this instead. Get on the train.

122
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:22,390
I hear so much as a footstep from this car. You'll end up like all your friends out here.

123
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,440
I have honor level? I told you to get on the train. Look, all you had, I'm not,

124
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,319
if you follow instructions, you're gonna be fine. How do I take, I need to go to the engine car?

125
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:48,150
What do they leave? What if they run away? I'm supposed to leave them back here? I don't know

126
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,900
if I want to do that. No, I'm not gonna, these guys listen. These guys follow directions.

127
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:22,410
Can I climb? What, what's going on? What was that? Okay. My horse is fine. How do I know

128
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,170
that they're gonna stay? If I'm that guy, I'm just gonna walk off the train right now.

129
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:33,700
No way to be found. They are running. What are you talking about? They're running.

130
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:50,710
No, that, where? No, they're not. They're gonna remember this. That's fine. I want them to.

131
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:01,339
One person said that. It doesn't matter how many people say it. Let's get this thing moving.

132
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:19,940
Why don't I stay on the train? If I'm one of these guys, I'm gonna lean out the window

133
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:28,170
and be like, sucker. I would throw a rock out the window at him. As you're gonna get,

134
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:36,019
you can catch the train. There's a bunch of heavy books in there. I'd whip a book

135
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,309
at him and try to hit him right in the head as hard as I could. I'd probably miss.

136
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:45,509
You ever try to throw something as hard as you can at something and you just,

137
00:22:45,509 --> 00:23:00,980
you weigh off. That's what happens every time we get out of this hole. We're going to try

138
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,900
whether it seems stable. And we just robbed the Leviticus Cornwall train.

139
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:10,660
We got money. It's the worst is behind us gentlemen. I'm an outlaw. I know this country

140
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,500
a little tuck them into bed camp in horseshoe overlook near Valentine. We'll be able to

141
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,460
hide out there. No problem. As long as we keep our noses clean. Well, then let's go

142
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:28,099
clean noses and everything else. Arthur, you're in that one. I know you two like to talk about

143
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:39,609
the good old days and what's gone wrong with old Dutch tuck them in. Nice. Well, that's a nice

144
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:57,660
icy waterfall. I'm glad we're getting to the title screen song with lyrics because

145
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:19,019
that's definitely where we are. This just sounds like somebody that's a karaoke

146
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:24,059
and they don't know the lyrics to the song for a whole portion. And then she's

147
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:40,809
going to sing the chorus. I don't even know the fucking chorus. Wow. Get over here. Yes, boss.

148
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:45,369
You two ride up ahead. Make sure there's no surprises. We've had enough of those.

149
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:55,079
Me with the boy. Come on, kid. You can buy me a whiskey. That sounds pretty good.

150
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,109
No, it's too easy. That's too easy. It's too easy to dump them during the song.

151
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:23,750
It's too easy.

152
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,069
Oh, I thought the horse went through the earth. Hey, hey, go. Oh,

153
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:42,839
I thought that the horse went all the way through. That was a preemptive.

154
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,279
I'm laughing. What the fuck? How do we lose a wheel?

155
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,150
So what's supposed to happen?

156
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:08,170
Hey, Charles, you and me hold the thing up while you try and put the wheel back on that.

157
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:27,269
Okay, lift it up. I'm playing house slipper again. That's all it takes. Oh yeah,

158
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:33,109
this is back in like the 1100s, right? The wheel was just invented.

159
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,460
Of course they're going to have technical problems with it.

160
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:56,039
You think? Trouble? Uh oh. We wouldn't have seen them.

161
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:06,150
We're bastards. We really screwed them over down here. Come on, let's not push our luck.

162
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,549
What happened? Well, get in. I'll tell you.

163
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:20,789
Here comes the whole story. Back to the wagon.

164
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,559
You can switch between different radar sizes in the compass by holding that.

165
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:36,789
Yeah, expand. No, no, no. Regular is fine.

166
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:43,289
I'll keep it on regular. That's fine. The Indians in these parts got sold a very raw deal.

167
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,299
This is the heartland we're going to. Good farming and grazing country.

168
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,220
We're just browsing around right now. We can take our time here.

169
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,980
Every blade of grass killed or heard it up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere.

170
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,680
There we go. This is more scenic. Kangaroo, kangaroo, get the kangaroo.

171
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,089
It's a four-legged kangaroo. How do I take out my gun?

172
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,079
Hey.

173
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,039
Don't mean he knows a damn thing about what he's talking about.

174
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,880
I'm trying. I'm just going regular speed.

175
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,259
So what happened to your trap?

176
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:50,789
I don't even know. It's not that I can remember.

177
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:54,599
My father was a cousin. Yes, the southern kangaroo.

178
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,119
He told me he lived with our people for a while. A number of freemen did.

179
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,740
Moved from our land. Three of us fled.

180
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,940
You got to know a family of like four is going to drive by then.

181
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,619
They're all going to turn their heads and go, oh, no.

182
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,099
Some soldiers captured my mother.

183
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:15,220
Took her somewhere. We never saw her again.

184
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,400
We drifted around. He was a very sad man.

185
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,940
Where clothes appropriate. I'm 13. I just took off on my own.

186
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,779
I was about the age we found young Arthur here.

187
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:31,720
Maybe a little older. A delinquent you never did see.

188
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,400
But he learned fast.

189
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,710
I was fast as Marston, apparently.

190
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:41,910
Wait, I don't understand. What's the problem between you two?

191
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,029
Nice shot. Yeah, it's a long story.

192
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,220
Do a flip with the carriage.

193
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,140
We still heading the right way.

194
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:55,700
That depends. Are we still heading west in search of fortune

195
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,660
and repose in virgin forests as we plan?

196
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,019
No. Are we heading in the correct direction

197
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:05,140
on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountain?

198
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,259
We're going the right way still.

199
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:09,460
Yes, I believe so. You know this area?

200
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,019
A little. I've been through a couple of times.

201
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:16,180
There's a livestock town not too far from here called Valentine.

202
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:21,140
Cowboys, outlaws, working girls, power kind of place.

203
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,619
Is this boring? Hey, we're doing the tutorial, man.

204
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:26,740
We're just trying to enjoy the game.

205
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,019
In this place we're going.

206
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,900
Wait, what's it called again?

207
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,180
Horseshoe Overlook.

208
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,460
I don't think I can even control this.

209
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,339
It's a good place to lie low.

210
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:34,980
It'll do for now.

211
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,900
I can't go anywhere because I'm straight.

212
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,819
How long do you think Dutch is really going to lie?

213
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:44,099
It's just, you know, maybe it's me who's changed, not him,

214
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:48,019
but we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right.

215
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,539
You and me had a real lead in Blackwater that could have worked out.

216
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,859
It just isn't like Dutch to lose his head like that.

217
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,940
When do we fight the wild west orcs?

218
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,380
What? This isn't like Skyrim.

219
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:09,099
Dutch, abandon this line.

220
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:15,720
We're still here, so I figure we must have got a ride to hell.

221
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,390
Who's eating?

222
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,480
Just some yarrow and ginseng.

223
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200
Good for the health.

224
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Better than that stuff you buy in the store.

225
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,720
Yeah, you can have all this.

226
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,240
I'm at the point where I can do it with my eyes closed.

227
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,799
Why don't you just wish sometimes that you could just eat this and be fine?

228
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,920
Eating sometimes is just a pain in the ass, don't you guys think?

229
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:55,660
I mean, I love food, but they're going to be annoying.

230
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,700
It's something you have to do.

231
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,500
It's like sleeping.

232
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,500
Think about your entire day.

233
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,980
Like 60% of your whole day is eating and sleeping.

234
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:06,420
Come on, man.

235
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,500
Like, where's the science there?

236
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:09,980
Let's go.

237
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,329
Oh, boy, this discussion again.

238
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:36,069
So just stop eating.

239
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:36,869
What's the big deal?

240
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,420
Okay.

241
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,779
Wait, what does it want to do?

242
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,940
Oh, stop the wagon.

243
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,839
Turn and stop.

244
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,250
Stop.

245
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:04,359
Do I have to back it up?

246
00:33:07,829 --> 00:33:08,630
All right, back up.

247
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:17,779
Where is he?

248
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,089
He's right around this rock.

249
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,880
Telephone's ringing.

250
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:30,069
All right.

251
00:33:30,069 --> 00:33:31,269
There he is over here, right?

252
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,380
Where is he?

253
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:35,980
Oh, my God.

254
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,099
Where is he?

255
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:42,740
Wasn't he right here?

256
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,049
Look at the map.

257
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:52,490
I mean, yeah, but wait, wait, wait.

258
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,049
Oh, there he is.

259
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,769
He got stuck in my shit, so he started walking.

260
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:02,119
All right, get on.

261
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,559
Can I beep?

262
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,090
Run him over.

263
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,090
No, I have to be like at least a decent person.

264
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,449
All right, get on.

265
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,860
Get on.

266
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:28,150
Where's the beep?

267
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,309
How do I peep at this guy?

268
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,679
Wait, did he disappear?

269
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,320
All right, we made it.

270
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,159
Home sweet home.

271
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:01,800
There we are.

272
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,000
Good thing that you made it.

273
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,579
He made it before we did.

274
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:22,579
I've never seen somebody fuck this section up.

275
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,380
Well, have you ever seen somebody do that whole section in cinematic mode?

276
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,679
Now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it, now you have it.

277
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,369
I ain't got that long, Dutch.

278
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:57,050
I want folks safe before I go.

279
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,769
Me too.

280
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:00,730
And now we are stuck east of the Gritsleys and out of money

281
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,050
and a long way from our dream of virgin land in the west.

282
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,409
I know, my brother, but we are safe.

283
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,090
We make a bit of money here.

284
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,929
Then we move again, head out around the west of Uncle Sam.

285
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:15,289
That's really hard to do.

286
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,250
Buy some land.

287
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,530
I hope so.

288
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,769
Would you just look around you?

289
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,139
This world has its consolations.

290
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,079
Gentlemen, I'm going to head into the local town

291
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,679
and, you know, see if I can strike up a little business.

292
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,679
Of course, Herr Strauss.

293
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,400
I prefer robbing banks to usury.

294
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,280
Seems more dignified somehow.

295
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,920
Now, everyone, put your tools down for a moment.

296
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,360
Come on, gather round.

297
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,079
Quickly now.

298
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,119
We're gonna need a speech.

299
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,679
I know that things have been tough.

300
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,519
Frio coming in with five community subs.

301
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,269
Thanks a lot, man.

302
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:02,070
So it is time for everyone to get to work.

303
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,070
Get to work, but stay out of trouble.

304
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,630
Remember, we are itinerant workers.

305
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,389
Laid off when they shut down our factory to the north.

306
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,750
Now get out there and see what you can find.

307
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,190
Uncle, Reverend Swanson, no more passengers.

308
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:23,349
It is time for everyone to earn their keep.

309
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:27,110
There is a town a little way down the track name of Valentine.

310
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,670
Can you play?

311
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,550
I'm playing the game.

312
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,269
I've stopped down all mard and morons, if I remember right.

313
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:31,909
This is the game.

314
00:37:31,909 --> 00:37:33,190
That seems a decent place to start.

315
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,989
And we need food, real food.

316
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:38,070
That means every day, one of you.

317
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,789
Now remember, whatever it is that you find.

318
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:41,989
It looks like it's from a different game

319
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:43,989
that somebody created and put them in here like a mod.

320
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:44,869
Gets, gets, slice.

321
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,590
Now be sensible out there.

322
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,449
Now the girls have your tent ready, Mr. Morgan.

323
00:37:51,449 --> 00:37:51,929
Come with me.

324
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,250
So we have a donation box.

325
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,210
We put you over here.

326
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:59,050
I'm sure everything will be fine, Miss Grimshaw.

327
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,690
It should be.

328
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,849
Most of your stuff from Blackwater got saved.

329
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,530
Everything apart from my money.

330
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,650
Oh, don't remind me.

331
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,369
Well, we can always make more money.

332
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,250
We're going to have to.

333
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,409
Miss Jackson, I've seen shit with more common sense.

334
00:38:12,409 --> 00:38:14,250
Sleep shame or change clothes at your tent.

335
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,480
Burz, I don't know why for a second.

336
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,679
I thought he was going to burn his clothes.

337
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:21,210
I'm done with these.

338
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,409
I think I'm going to get rid of them.

339
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:29,369
Horseshoe Overlook, chapter two.

340
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:30,329
That was chapter one.

341
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:31,530
How many chapters are there?

342
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:37,000
That's not how you guys change clothes.

343
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,690
What did they do before?

344
00:38:42,969 --> 00:38:43,769
No, never mind.

345
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,050
That's a stupid thing to say.

346
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:46,889
What did they do before?

347
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:47,369
Laundry.

348
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,849
They just left this clothes on.

349
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:56,860
You rinsed it in a stream.

350
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,960
Dutch seems a little better.

351
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:03,340
His eyes are sparkling once more.

352
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,500
Funny guys, funny number joke.

353
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
I think we all feel a little happier.

354
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,519
So this is a few weeks later.

355
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,960
Despite of Blackwater and that.

356
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:19,230
Jose.

357
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,829
Quite a day.

358
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,190
Eat, drink, play.

359
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,150
Let's hope so.

360
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,030
At Dave and Busters.

361
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,989
There's a bunch of the boys already in Valentine.

362
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,510
You've got to maintain your course, don't you?

363
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,150
Half price Wednesdays.

364
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,190
Oh, by the way, half price is actually what it should be every day

365
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,590
because it's like four dollars to play one game here.

366
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:45,829
Don't come here.

367
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:56,940
What are you saying?

368
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,460
You guys don't have, you don't, you never played,

369
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,500
you went to Dave and Busters?

370
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,940
Cam, camera.

371
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,219
Your games can't be shown by a symbol on the map.

372
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:08,019
Eagle talent, talisman.

373
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:10,019
Okay, so your beard is getting long.

374
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,380
You can use the shaving kit beside your tent

375
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,059
or visit a barbershop to maintain your facial hair.

376
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,360
Nothing at all.

377
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,440
For the first time in weeks, nothing.

378
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,829
We're free.

379
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:23,110
Okay, there's lots of details here.

380
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,909
Hold on.

381
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:29,079
So you got permanently increases the time

382
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,159
that eagle eye can stay active for five seconds.

383
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:34,380
Crafted from rare legendary animal parts.

384
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:38,039
Permanently decreases the damage the player receives

385
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,400
while on horseback by 10 percent.

386
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,880
Okay, that's interesting.

387
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,000
You can make little charms.

388
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,150
A hundred and seventy eight animals.

389
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,880
What?

390
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,739
There were like four in the last game.

391
00:40:53,559 --> 00:41:00,519
Deer, bear, coyote, and like rabbit, right?

392
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,719
Six gangs, 30 fish, 74 pieces of equipment.

393
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,519
This seems huge.

394
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:14,199
Hey, I discovered the deer and the bears.

395
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,400
Where's the bear?

396
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,679
How have I not discovered the bear?

397
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,340
I literally shot him in the face with an arrow.

398
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,079
It's easy to track them.

399
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:30,260
Okay, I see.

400
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,760
All right.

401
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,260
Bring Pearson animals to supply the camp.

402
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,579
He can use the meat for food and skins to craft satchels

403
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:41,619
with increased capacity.

404
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,460
All right, there's a lot going on.

405
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,420
Let me take a look.

406
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,059
Let me, I don't care what that guy has to say right now.

407
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,599
Let's like, let's do some shaving.

408
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,889
Now, is this like, is this like the,

409
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,730
you guys remember,

410
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,170
no one's gonna know what I'm talking about here.

411
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:03,750
The magnet face thing where you have the magnet hair

412
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,469
on the guy's face.

413
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:05,989
It was like a 14 cent toy.

414
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,510
Length.

415
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,340
Oh, you actually can do this.

416
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,449
Hold on, chin.

417
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,239
Oh, I think I doesn't want a dirty chin.

418
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,039
I don't know.

419
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:32,760
What do you think?

420
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,420
Just gigantic chops?

421
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,510
Hmm.

422
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,739
No, I just want the piece of hair for my chin

423
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,019
to go down as far as it can go.

424
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:50,889
Yeah.

425
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:06,699
I'm gonna look like an Amish guy.

426
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:23,769
Can I dye my whole like face purple and my beard purple?

427
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:26,940
Yeah, that's good.

428
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay.

429
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,699
I like it like this so far.

430
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:33,829
I'm gonna keep that going as long as it can go.

431
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,389
The current stock levels are shown when near the tithing box.

432
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:44,579
All right, let's take a look.

433
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,380
Now, that's perfectly balanced facial hair.

434
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:51,940
Here's something to make a stew.

435
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,900
You can eat from the pot.

436
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,159
I'm getting a lot of info here.

437
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,619
Uh-huh.

438
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,659
They demanded to know.

439
00:44:07,659 --> 00:44:09,820
It's like lore in case you want to see it.

440
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,559
Let me just like take it in for a second here

441
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:16,760
because here's the donation box.

442
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:19,480
How much should I, how much money should I give?

443
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:20,940
Contribute.

444
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,280
How much can I contribute if I don't give money?

445
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:28,909
Okay.

446
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:45,559
I did my, somebody's, somebody's slurping out of a big gulp.

447
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,360
What the hell was that?

448
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:55,000
It was a radio.

449
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,079
I thought somebody said like a giant soda.

450
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,090
Let's keep looking around.

451
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:04,590
Hold on.

452
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,570
Food, I want to get, let me eat some stew.

453
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:10,780
Yeah, that's less, that's less than a hundred bits.

454
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,500
I ain't gonna read it.

455
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,610
It's a stew.

456
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,489
What kind of stew is it?

457
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:22,730
It's not, is it not done?

458
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,639
I want some of that.

459
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,239
How do I get some of that?

460
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,650
Oh, okay.

461
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,409
I have to take, I have to actually pick the bowl up.

462
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:43,449
This is the one, two parts here.

463
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,699
I only get to eat once every few days.

464
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:56,650
I can just walk around and talk while eating.

465
00:45:58,409 --> 00:46:01,550
All right, this is pretty cool.

466
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,429
All right, this is good.

467
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,789
Can I throw it like, like acid?

468
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:10,909
Can I throw it in somebody's face?

469
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:17,869
How do I, I want to talk.

470
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:21,440
All right, I'm gonna sit here.

471
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,269
Am I allowed at this part, at the lunch table?

472
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:34,909
What the fuck?

473
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:35,869
Nobody wants to talk to me.

474
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:39,309
I can't sit with the cool kids at the lunch table.

475
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,960
Hey, no, I wasn't done with that.

476
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,159
Sit back down and eat the rest of that.

477
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,360
Okay, I can talk.

478
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:17,579
That was a, that was as shitty as a conversation as what's the weather like.

479
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,019
In this, look at that weather, huh?

480
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,599
I only get to eat once every three days and I'm gonna leave half my plate.

481
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,480
What am I at?

482
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,280
The olive garden?

483
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,880
Okay, what's over here?

484
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:46,719
Oh, this guy, this is the guy shaving the turkey.

485
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,239
Crafting upgrades, donate.

486
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,440
Look, I'll give you some meat so we get a feather.

487
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:02,989
Here, you can have, you can have a, you can have a bird feather.

488
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,170
I'm getting money here.

489
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:13,369
Donate all, donate for provisions.

490
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,210
I think I want to do that.

491
00:48:15,769 --> 00:48:23,260
Donated, springy meat, donated.

492
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,059
I'm just gonna give it to him.

493
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,679
This is fish meat.

494
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,000
Two pieces of meat and we got some venison here.

495
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:37,929
Can I like cook on the, I'm just gonna give them all.

496
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:38,650
Just take it all.

497
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,869
Don't say like I never gave you nothing.

498
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:46,190
Just take it.

499
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,630
Oh shit, okay, hold on.

500
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,809
Can I not give these?

501
00:48:55,769 --> 00:49:00,139
All right, so crafting upgrades.

502
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:00,860
Let's see what I can do here.

503
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:06,059
Okay, so craft satchel, increase carrying capacity.

504
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:12,329
Tonic satchel, I can't do any of these.

505
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,659
Oh god damn it.

506
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:19,360
I need like person, fusion cannot craft this yet.

507
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,239
I can't craft any of these.

508
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,780
Okay, so I need to purchase leather working tools

509
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,380
and upgrade the medicine wagon twice.

510
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:30,780
I got so much work to do.

511
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,900
There's a lot of work here.

512
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:34,750
I can make my own house.

513
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:40,480
I need one perfect ram carcass.

514
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,400
Cleaned up ram skull to be displayed at your tent.

515
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,119
Drugs, I don't have anything.

516
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,949
Upgrade the main camp's campfire.

517
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:55,690
I don't have any of this shit.

518
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,969
I need to like play the game first.

519
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,519
All right, well, thanks for the money.

520
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,320
What about you?

521
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:06,139
Morning, Mr. Morgan.

522
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:08,110
There's a guy over here.

523
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,949
What do the exclamation points mean?

524
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,659
Oh, these are provisions or something, right?

525
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,139
Can I like, I can take certain amount of provisions every day?

526
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,300
I'm assuming they're not grayed out.

527
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:22,800
Right, that would make sense, wouldn't it?

528
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:25,900
Needs to be restocked.

529
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,500
Okay, well, I'm just gonna go.

530
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,940
Let's do a mission.

531
00:50:29,579 --> 00:50:34,559
Where's my horse?

532
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,659
Do the mission, do the mission.

533
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,260
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.

534
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,900
How are we doing on our stamina?

535
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,809
You can command your horse to stay,

536
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:51,369
flee, or follow by focusing on it with the L2 when it's nearby.

537
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,820
Yes, I'm on it currently.

538
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,820
All right, so we got G, E, U, or R, S.

539
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,619
We're gonna go towards G, E.

540
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:15,179
Galloping horses cause stamina drain.

541
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:15,980
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

542
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,900
173 bullets, 41, 173.

543
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:26,460
Okay, I have ammo, so I'm just gonna go.

544
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,679
Hold X to maintain the horse's canter and quench some stamina.

545
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:32,159
Sounds good.

546
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:43,920
The world has opened up now.

547
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,920
We're going to the first mission.

548
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,860
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

549
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

550
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,780
Wait, wait, wait, an animal.

551
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,739
An animal I can take and bring back to the, to the, what is it?

552
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:02,699
It's a turkey.

553
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:03,340
It's a turkey.

554
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,079
Study the turkey.

555
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,320
Where is it?

556
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:11,800
There it is.

557
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,199
Study it.

558
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:14,889
Can I talk to them?

559
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,449
How did you, I ran it over.

560
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,760
All right, let's go study them.

561
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:40,360
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

562
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,920
Bird meat.

563
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:44,039
When you skin or pluck an animal, you take meat from the carcass

564
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,880
and you can cook and eat this meat at a campfire.

565
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,840
I, we need to take this back.

566
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:53,800
Can I like throw it at somebody?

567
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:55,960
No, that's a gun.

568
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:57,719
All right, we're gonna take this back.

569
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:04,489
All right, there's another one over here.

570
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:05,210
Where's the other turkey?

571
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,179
Pick up and examine.

572
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,059
So it's a random wild mushroom.

573
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,809
Parasol mushroom is a health herb.

574
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:22,329
It can be eaten to refill your health core

575
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:23,769
or be crafted to as bait.

576
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,289
What can I eat?

577
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,909
What do I eat?

578
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,960
This is dangerous.

579
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,440
I don't know why.

580
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,960
I don't think anyone should do this.

581
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,420
Oh, we're fine.

582
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,829
Okay, give me the other turkey.

583
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,510
This time, I'm not gonna skin this one.

584
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,309
I'm gonna bring this back to,

585
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,989
but I don't know what his name is.

586
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:51,900
Who's that?

587
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,750
Who's this guy?

588
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,699
You think I got a problem?

589
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:05,280
He ain't getting eaten one of these turkeys.

590
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,480
I'm guaranteeing you that.

591
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:18,480
How many turkeys can I put on one horse?

592
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,920
What?

593
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,920
I'm just messing with you.

594
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,219
I'm just messing with you, dude.

595
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:42,730
Hold on.

596
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:43,210
You can...

597
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:43,929
How do I rob him?

598
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:54,639
No, no, wait.

599
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:55,599
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

600
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:02,880
No, I didn't...

601
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,599
Just stop moving.

602
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:10,559
Where's it going?

603
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,360
GE?

604
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,000
That guy.

605
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,119
Wait, that guy might have something.

606
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,079
Oh, there's a witness.

607
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,780
The horse is the witness?

608
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,539
It's this guy.

609
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:25,019
Stop.

610
00:55:25,019 --> 00:55:25,420
Hands up.

611
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:28,119
Get your hands in the air.

612
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:31,869
Stop.

613
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,539
Stop it.

614
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,500
I don't want to have to do this.

615
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:40,780
Stop.

616
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:48,539
Stop moving.

617
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:00,969
Come on now.

618
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:18,429
What do you have?

619
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:19,949
Hey.

620
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:24,280
All right, I got to get rid of this guy.

621
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,440
Is this like Hitman?

622
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,280
Do I have to like bury him somewhere?

623
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,840
He's sitting in the trees.

624
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,840
No more witnesses.

625
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,159
We're good.

626
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,840
What was he doing?

627
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,320
Oh, this way.

628
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:47,559
Okay.

629
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,159
You can't skin a person.

630
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,199
What are you talking about?

631
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:54,079
Wait, we're going this way.

632
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:08,909
No, you can't just rob and kill every person.

633
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,599
There are turkeys over here anyways,

634
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:13,559
and that's what we care about.

635
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:21,530
Where'd they go up here?

636
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:25,719
I don't see anybody.

637
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,780
No, they got away.

638
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,260
That's okay.

639
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,300
Study.

640
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,260
Wait, I can study sheep?

641
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,210
Hold binoculars while looking at them.

642
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:53,130
I don't understand.

643
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,610
Does that work?

644
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:08,170
I don't think it worked.

645
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:08,809
Go eat them?

646
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,570
What am I, the big bad wolf?

647
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:13,900
Okay, slow down.

648
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,260
No, I'll get in trouble here.

649
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:19,659
Animals attached to your horse will decompose.

650
00:58:19,659 --> 00:58:20,619
Sell them before this happens.

651
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:21,340
Oh, shit.

652
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,139
I need to sell these.

653
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,980
Flies.

654
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,010
Study quick.

655
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:30,889
Come here.

656
00:58:30,889 --> 00:58:31,210
Come here.

657
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:31,530
Come here.

658
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:31,769
No.

659
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:39,420
Got it.

660
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:39,980
All right.

661
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,380
Let's go.

662
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,840
That was a shot in the dark completely.

663
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:51,019
Made it.

664
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:55,130
I don't know how fast I can like full sprint over here though.

665
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:55,610
There we go.

666
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,010
We're good.

667
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,639
Hitch the horse.

668
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,440
Now we're at the general store.

669
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,869
No, I need the turkey.

670
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:08,269
Turkeys.

671
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:08,829
I need both.

672
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:09,469
I need a turkey.

673
00:59:10,269 --> 00:59:10,590
Okay.

674
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:12,510
I got fresh turkeys here,

675
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:16,409
and I'm willing to sell it for a moderate price.

676
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,039
Bring that in here.

677
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:26,119
Go.

678
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:26,679
What?

679
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,760
Hey, what am I, what are you, what?

680
00:59:30,429 --> 00:59:32,190
I'm trying to sell you a turkey, man.

681
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,070
Oh, don't do that.

682
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,019
I'll kick you out.

683
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:36,059
You can interact with the shopkeeper

684
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:36,940
by approaching the catalog.

685
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,500
What?

686
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,639
I just got kicked out for bringing a turkey.

687
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:49,869
Where's the butcher?

688
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,150
Pardon me.

689
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:53,820
God damn it.

690
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:54,219
Come here.

691
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:54,539
Let's go.

692
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,940
All right.

693
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,340
Here we go.

694
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:02,269
Hey, I got a, you can interact with the shopkeeper.

695
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:02,510
All right.

696
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:02,829
Let's go.

697
01:00:02,829 --> 01:00:03,949
I'm going to throw it down on here.

698
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,800
I got some quality meat here.

699
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:11,929
All right.

700
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:14,010
I don't, I, I don't have to walk it over here.

701
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:14,250
Okay.

702
01:00:14,889 --> 01:00:16,750
Sales of turkey meat.

703
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:21,070
Salted beef.

704
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,869
I'm going to keep that.

705
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,519
Turkey feathers.

706
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:27,710
50 cents.

707
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:28,190
That's not bad.

708
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:28,670
That's pretty good.

709
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,170
To sell a pelt stored on the back of your horse,

710
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,369
take your horse close to the butcher.

711
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:36,250
Oh, I got to get the horse.

712
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:42,760
All right.

713
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,320
Horse cargo.

714
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,440
What does he got on there?

715
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,670
Ooh, look at all this stuff.

716
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,719
I have so much shit here.

717
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,199
I got two championship pelts.

718
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,360
All right.

719
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,559
I don't think I can sell any of these.

720
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,400
Maybe I can time game.

721
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,150
I feel like I shouldn't sell these.

722
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,030
I'm probably going to need them.

723
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:05,320
All right.

724
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,519
Let's go find a Mr.

725
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:06,760
Mr.

726
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,400
G E.

727
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
Clips indicate optional stranger missions.

728
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,280
Speak to the stranger.

729
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:13,340
Question mark flip.

730
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,590
Do you see a dude?

731
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,389
I don't see one of them.

732
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:18,909
Do you see a question mark flip?

733
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:24,730
I don't see one.

734
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,639
All right.

735
01:01:27,639 --> 01:01:28,039
Let's just go.

736
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:28,760
Let's find this guy.

737
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:30,780
I don't think he's in the store.

738
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,420
Probably down here.

739
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:33,739
I need to close.

740
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,980
Oh, no, I, I guess it is.

741
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,340
He's in this saloon.

742
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,320
The psycho in me just wants to like throw a chair in here.

743
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,039
But I know not yet.

744
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:52,440
Come here.

745
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:52,679
Come here.

746
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:53,079
Come over here.

747
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,119
I want you to meet our friends.

748
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,800
Pleased to meet you.

749
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,719
Why, you're just a toughest mountain man.

750
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,880
Oh, you be quiet, Anastasia.

751
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,239
Anyone can tell this one is a pussy cat.

752
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:05,880
Exactly.

753
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,440
Yes, he's a pussy cat.

754
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,800
Ain't that so, Arthur?

755
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,679
Whatever you say.

756
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,000
How much you cost, anyway.

757
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,559
Ain't that a nice way to talk to a lady?

758
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:18,519
Oh, I didn't know I was talking to a lady.

759
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:19,159
Excuse me.

760
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:26,039
Well, I must say, you gotta find way with the women, amigo.

761
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:28,650
They're dandy and a charm.

762
01:02:29,449 --> 01:02:30,090
What's in there?

763
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:30,650
Chocolate milk?

764
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:33,050
Oh, man, I dread to think about it.

765
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,860
Hey, you motherfucker.

766
01:02:42,349 --> 01:02:43,070
Barroom brawl.

767
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,949
This is where it starts.

768
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:50,079
This is what you came for.

769
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,280
This is for me to get my ass kicked.

770
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:04,010
What do you got?

771
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,469
Oh, what's that?

772
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:06,349
You just got dodged?

773
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,679
How do I pick up a chair?

774
01:03:11,239 --> 01:03:13,000
Come on, there's gonna be something I can do here.

775
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:17,599
Wait, who's that?

776
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,099
Who is that guy?

777
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:22,059
Uh-oh, here's the boss.

778
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,550
Uh-oh, a chair.

779
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,500
Can I rip off the gas line and just throw a match in here?

780
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:42,110
Nice.

781
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,030
Pick up.

782
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:48,059
No, I want the, I don't want the hat.

783
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:48,699
I want the chair.

784
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,320
Hello?

785
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:55,869
Hello?

786
01:03:56,590 --> 01:04:02,829
Oh, didn't even break the table.

787
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:04,409
Come on, man.

788
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:12,039
Let's go.

789
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,150
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

790
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,030
Ear grab.

791
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:18,750
That's not cool.

792
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:36,570
Come on, he's bigger than me.

793
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:43,239
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

794
01:04:43,239 --> 01:04:44,280
Scripted, scripted.

795
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:45,639
Scripted.

796
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:53,309
You blocked everything.

797
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:15,579
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

798
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,630
All right, am I missing something from the tutorial five days ago?

799
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,590
I never remember.

800
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,949
Am I, am I not doing something right here?

801
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:27,710
I think I'm, you hold the block.

802
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:28,909
You can dodge too, can't you?

803
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:44,159
Counter attack.

804
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,559
But so you, what, you hold square and then hit like left to right right before he swings, right?

805
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:52,400
Remember, I did the first half of this tutorial five days ago.

806
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,360
I haven't turned it on since.

807
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:03,480
Just pressing the direction while holding the block.

808
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,489
Save the goatee?

809
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:08,730
No.

810
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:18,909
I'm gonna knock shower for the rest of the game.

811
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,880
Can I stay like this forever?

812
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,880
Can I just be the guy that got slimed the whole game?

813
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:58,010
He's being held by some bounty hunters.

814
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,769
Trying to see how much money the government will pay them.

815
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:05,530
I know he's in Blackwater, but there's talk of them moving.

816
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,130
We'll get a second here.

817
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,730
I'm going to update you guys on the green screen.

818
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,480
Well, then we're dead men for sure.

819
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,599
Well, we've been live for about an hour.

820
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:16,039
There'll be bankertons all over the place.

821
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,800
But if he's alive, we've got to try.

822
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,840
Updates on how that's going to happen.

823
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,320
Yeah, of course.

824
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,880
It's you they want, Dutch.

825
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,840
Always is.

826
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,360
Charles, go find out what you can.

827
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,239
Carefully.

828
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:29,400
Josiah, take Javier.

829
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,199
Arthur, go get yourself cleaned up.

830
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,480
Join them when you're ready.

831
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:35,000
What about me?

832
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,789
Well, exactly.

833
01:07:37,789 --> 01:07:38,670
What about you?

834
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,190
What does that mean?

835
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:44,190
Oh no, never mind.

836
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:53,949
Okay, so let's talk for a second.

837
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,070
So if you missed the stream.

838
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:58,909
Let me just put the camera on because we're here.

839
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:02,349
If you missed the stream from three or four days ago or so.

840
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:07,309
My plan was because we were having a bunch of internet problems and we still are.

841
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:08,590
It's not completely fixed yet.

842
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:12,349
So wait, is this my my desync here?

843
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:13,880
I might be.

844
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,470
Let me sync this up.

845
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:38,220
All right.

846
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,800
Come on out here thing.

847
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,279
There we go.

848
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:45,020
All right.

849
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:51,529
So because the beard's growing, I haven't had time to shave.

850
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,479
It should be good now.

851
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:01,000
But anyways, because of the internet problems, my plan was if we didn't get it back,

852
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,439
I was going to desperately try to get the green screen stream done like tomorrow.

853
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:09,560
But now that they're actually working on the infrastructural problems that were in this area,

854
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,319
I think I'll be able to stream now.

855
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,039
I don't quote me on that, but like I did just say it.

856
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:18,439
This has been green here for a while.

857
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:19,239
No drop frames.

858
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,520
It's looking all right for now.

859
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,399
So the green screen stream, if you don't know what I'm talking about,

860
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,479
I'm going to get in front of a green screen for like an hour or two,

861
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,560
and I'm going to do a bunch of actions that you guys ask for and that we vote on.

862
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:34,039
But here's how I'm changing it though.

863
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,060
Because I'm including props, you know,

864
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:40,460
I'm only going to we're going to set it up properly in a couple of sections.

865
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,739
Like you'll be voting for props, you know, prop actions.

866
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:49,020
You'll be voting for regular actions because every prop action will just win.

867
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,260
And I'll have to spend like five grand on like two day Amazon stuff.

868
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:57,500
So we're definitely we're definitely going to have to split it off into different sections.

869
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,180
So you have to vote for your favorite one.

870
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,319
This is such a good idea.

871
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:03,439
It's going to be a lot of fun.

872
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,159
So we're not doing that like tomorrow,

873
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,880
because I need some more time to go through and section these off.

874
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,800
And I'm going to present in the Discord a series of polls.

875
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:14,720
We're going to vote on them.

876
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,880
This is not I'm going to I'm going to try to get this done from tonight into tomorrow.

877
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,479
And I'd say by this weekend, you'll have a poll to vote on,

878
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,000
but with three different sections in it.

879
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,079
And then I'll be streaming periodically, hopefully, if the internet stays fine.

880
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:34,560
Expect now that the streams are able to happen from here.

881
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,600
We'll push this forward a little bit so people have time to participate.

882
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,079
And we'll get that stream probably going next week,

883
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:44,079
like probably like six or seven days from right now.

884
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:49,210
I have a studio that I'm currently in contact with and working with.

885
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,729
So it is it's happening.

886
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:52,729
We just need some more time to get it prepared.

887
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:55,340
Because I know I'm going to need to buy props,

888
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,340
and that's going to take at least two days to get that stuff here.

889
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,699
So hopefully, that's a decent update.

890
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:02,539
It's no longer a secret anymore, by the way,

891
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:04,699
because I need to know what props I have to get.

892
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:07,979
So that this is the whole secret thing.

893
01:11:07,979 --> 01:11:10,939
Like, I'm not going to know is that's not happening anymore.

894
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:13,340
So I'll be in there browsing and perusing.

895
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,100
And JabbaDab just gave five more subs.

896
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,520
Five community subs from JabbaDab.

897
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,810
Thank you.

898
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,409
Can't you just paint one of your rooms green?

899
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:23,930
Oh, I mean, well, I could.

900
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,449
But you have to remember something.

901
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,250
A green screen studio is like 50 feet up and down.

902
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,289
If I were to paint a room back here,

903
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:35,130
it would just be like by it would be impossible to do,

904
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,529
let's say me sprinting and sliding into home base.

905
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,449
I wouldn't be able to do that with an actual studio.

906
01:11:41,449 --> 01:11:46,890
I'll be able to do large scale movements, full body, feet, everything.

907
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:47,689
It will be keyed out.

908
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:52,199
And thank Kazzy 101 just gave five community subs here.

909
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:52,600
Thank you.

910
01:11:54,859 --> 01:11:55,739
Here's another one.

911
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:58,840
Thank you so much, guys.

912
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,560
Both of you.

913
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,279
Five in a row here.

914
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:00,840
Five in a row.

915
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:03,050
Yeah.

916
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:05,210
So like you'll be able to see full body,

917
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,090
complete green over like a 40 or 50 foot space.

918
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,489
It professionally lit.

919
01:12:10,489 --> 01:12:15,319
It'll be perfect because you either go hard or go home with this.

920
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:15,880
You know what I'm saying?

921
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,880
Like, I don't want to put like just a green screen behind me

922
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,880
and like do five Fortnite dances.

923
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:20,920
No, no, no, no, no, no.

924
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,079
Like, there's going to be a lot of shit

925
01:12:23,079 --> 01:12:24,279
that I'm going to do in front of this camera.

926
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:29,279
But regardless, that's kind of the update with that situation.

927
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:30,560
We're going to do that probably next week.

928
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:33,680
Give some more time to get more suggestions

929
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,960
and for me to make some polls

930
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,399
and you will hear about it again over the coming couple of days.

931
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,279
Here we go.

932
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:39,600
Okay.

933
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,649
Back to John Marston.

934
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:43,449
Or no, Arthur.

935
01:12:44,409 --> 01:12:44,649
All right.

936
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:46,010
Multiple missions are available in the camp.

937
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:47,850
These are shown as the, that thing.

938
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:50,000
All right.

939
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,600
I need to take, maybe I should take a bath.

940
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,840
Can we have a peek at the recommendations?

941
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,640
You can go look at it right now.

942
01:12:58,119 --> 01:12:58,920
You got your act together.

943
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,199
There's a channel in the discord.

944
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:00,920
I don't need to warn you again.

945
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,199
That is, I don't have anything in my, okay.

946
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:06,920
Well, just please can I, I don't want to kind of aim weapon.

947
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,520
Browse catalog.

948
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,960
No more nonsense from you.

949
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,479
Here's the catalog.

950
01:13:11,479 --> 01:13:13,720
There's a green screen discord channel.

951
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,220
Okay.

952
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,319
Ammunition, hunting and fishing, horse care, clothing.

953
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:17,819
Here we go.

954
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,479
Clothing department, outfits.

955
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:22,439
Let's take a look at the outfits.

956
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,279
No, 85 bucks.

957
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,560
The Valentine, 113.

958
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,119
It's locked.

959
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,069
Custom tailored apparel of distinction.

960
01:13:37,069 --> 01:13:37,869
That one's not bad.

961
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,640
The Dewberry Creek.

962
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:44,119
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

963
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:45,079
Get down to business.

964
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,350
Uh, dude, please.

965
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,310
Worn flat cap.

966
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,229
Ooh, some of these are nice.

967
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:55,739
Big city hat.

968
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:57,840
Derby hat.

969
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:01,199
Duster coat.

970
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,439
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:09,600
Can I, was they a blackwater possum skin hat?

972
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,770
Should I get the rat hat?

973
01:14:12,409 --> 01:14:14,520
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

974
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,279
With items from our sewing department.

975
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,649
Can I not select it?

976
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:30,460
You need to bring the rat.

977
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:30,960
No.

978
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:34,890
I need to go kill rats?

979
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:38,680
All right, I need one that's going to be cool.

980
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,640
I'm overheating, right?

981
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:44,010
Am I getting like the crotchless pants?

982
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:49,720
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

983
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,600
Get down to business.

984
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,630
Okay, these are just pajamas.

985
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:01,529
Ranch pants.

986
01:15:02,329 --> 01:15:03,760
Thin and ranch pants.

987
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,399
Button fly.

988
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,199
Durable friends.

989
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,079
These are bargains.

990
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,119
But please go ahead and turn the page in an inconceivable active account.

991
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,199
Well, now I have to buy it because...

992
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:20,189
Got things to tend to, so get on with it.

993
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:21,630
Can I be like a big candy cane?

994
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:27,130
All right, I'm going to be a candy cane.

995
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,250
Yeah, Halloween's over.

996
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,050
It's time for Christmas.

997
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:35,630
Okay.

998
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,140
Which, what are the cheapest ones?

999
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,100
Well, these ones are 16.

1000
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:47,680
We're going with the dog shit ones down here.

1001
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,159
Worn, well, actually, riding boots.

1002
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,119
These are probably, these are all right.

1003
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,579
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1004
01:15:57,579 --> 01:15:58,939
Get down to business.

1005
01:15:58,939 --> 01:16:02,159
I can't do green?

1006
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,199
I mean, this is kind of green.

1007
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,329
I can't do green boots for like Christmas?

1008
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:12,090
That's as close as I'm going to get.

1009
01:16:12,729 --> 01:16:24,750
Anything else?

1010
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:26,350
I mean, I have to get a different coat.

1011
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:28,670
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1012
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:29,710
Our special attention.

1013
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,600
Okay, we got gloves.

1014
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,239
There's a lot of shit here.

1015
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:39,880
All right, these are big like cleaning rubber gloves.

1016
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,760
Let's check these out.

1017
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,489
Oh, those aren't Christmas.

1018
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:50,729
There's so much shit here.

1019
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:51,689
It's like overwhelming.

1020
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:52,250
All right, hold on.

1021
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,520
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1022
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,479
Get down to business.

1023
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:01,930
What am I doing?

1024
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:05,449
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1025
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:06,970
Open that back up.

1026
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:10,510
Press square.

1027
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,390
Square just reads.

1028
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,890
Okay, here we go.

1029
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:17,210
Coats.

1030
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:20,970
Get the rat hat.

1031
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:21,529
I can't.

1032
01:17:22,489 --> 01:17:24,920
This is a classic one.

1033
01:17:25,899 --> 01:17:29,069
Let's take a look.

1034
01:17:29,069 --> 01:17:29,470
Damn it.

1035
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,590
L2, R2 for free pants.

1036
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,680
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1037
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,810
I just want a red like candy cane coat.

1038
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,609
Shotgun coat.

1039
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,130
Get square when you're looking at the clothing.

1040
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,390
Square is read.

1041
01:18:00,189 --> 01:18:02,109
Like go like this.

1042
01:18:02,909 --> 01:18:06,439
I don't understand.

1043
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:12,010
Like square, I just select the price and then it's like a view is X.

1044
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:15,630
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1045
01:18:15,630 --> 01:18:16,109
There we go.

1046
01:18:16,670 --> 01:18:21,340
Looks all right.

1047
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:26,319
That matches kind of.

1048
01:18:32,409 --> 01:18:33,529
Oh, well, that, okay.

1049
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:44,220
How much is this for 16?

1050
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,060
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1051
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,869
I'm just going to look like a cork jester.

1052
01:18:50,909 --> 01:18:57,159
It's going to have to be this one.

1053
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:04,029
All right, now we're going to go back.

1054
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:05,390
We're only going to do this once, guys.

1055
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:05,789
Don't worry.

1056
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:08,750
I need like a Santa hat on.

1057
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:14,760
That's not really a Santa hat, is it?

1058
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:18,119
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1059
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:19,000
Get down to business.

1060
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:23,279
All right, these ones are already kind of red.

1061
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:33,739
I'm spending a lot of money.

1062
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:38,439
Is that it?

1063
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:40,199
Is there any more red stuff?

1064
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:41,880
Like striped candy cane stuff?

1065
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,880
All right, vests.

1066
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,720
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1067
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:52,000
Oh, boy.

1068
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,359
Here we go.

1069
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,380
Okay, now I just need a shirt.

1070
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:11,369
See what we got.

1071
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:15,279
Maybe I don't have a shirt.

1072
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:16,399
Maybe just no shirt?

1073
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,260
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1074
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:19,739
Get down to business.

1075
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:20,619
Does this make sense here?

1076
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:24,090
Let's see.

1077
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,270
Yeah, that's fine.

1078
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,409
Blue?

1079
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:34,970
No, no.

1080
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,210
This is like the Union.

1081
01:20:37,210 --> 01:20:37,930
Yeah, hold on.

1082
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:41,760
Is there another one?

1083
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,720
Oh, this one's striped.

1084
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,359
There we go.

1085
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:48,699
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1086
01:20:48,699 --> 01:20:49,500
Kind of candy cane?

1087
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,579
Am I done?

1088
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:56,539
Am I done?

1089
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,810
I mean, it's not really a holiday.

1090
01:21:16,939 --> 01:21:17,420
It's more...

1091
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:24,010
I need gloves.

1092
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:25,210
All right, I need...

1093
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:29,529
This is going to get ruined anyways.

1094
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:35,579
Oh, boy.

1095
01:21:35,579 --> 01:21:39,659
Oh, I just need a green horse.

1096
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:40,460
All right, gloves.

1097
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,439
Accessories, right?

1098
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,010
Okay, all gloves.

1099
01:21:50,649 --> 01:22:00,060
I mean, that's as close as we're going to get it.

1100
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:02,699
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1101
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:03,579
Get down to business.

1102
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,630
You look like the cowboy Joker.

1103
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:12,119
All right, so we've got spurs, too, right?

1104
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:19,229
Gurdon spurs, leak, multi-tone, border stamp, leather bootstrap, and Paul's steel hay bed.

1105
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:20,750
That's a run-on sentence.

1106
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,550
Shank and 10-point Ravels.

1107
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,229
I don't like those.

1108
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:30,239
That's not bad.

1109
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:38,189
I got things to tend to, so get on with it.

1110
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:42,619
Hmm, those ones are big.

1111
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,069
Ooh, these have jingle bells on them, though.

1112
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:48,189
That's important.

1113
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:51,130
Let's try these ones first.

1114
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,770
No, that's not bad.

1115
01:22:54,329 --> 01:22:58,920
Are there any others besides those ones?

1116
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,800
These are close.

1117
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:01,310
Those are good.

1118
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,479
I ain't going to stay patient forever.

1119
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,960
Okay.

1120
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,760
Get down to business.

1121
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,720
All right, I've spent like half the money that I own, so that's it.

1122
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:19,869
All right, my outfit is now done for the rest of the game.

1123
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:29,720
Okay, well, I've got something to tell you.

1124
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,199
From behind here, we just look like a grandma.

1125
01:23:33,079 --> 01:23:34,760
Especially with like the side purse.

1126
01:23:36,649 --> 01:23:37,449
Yeah, look.

1127
01:23:37,449 --> 01:23:38,250
Oh, Jesus.

1128
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,340
Would you look at that?

1129
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:43,949
There's a sale on flowers over here.

1130
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:46,430
Oh, my aching back.

1131
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:48,109
Oh, my aching back.

1132
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:53,359
It's time to go to church.

1133
01:23:54,079 --> 01:24:04,399
Just wait, this is not my horse.

1134
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:05,439
Oh, shit.

1135
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:05,760
Is it?

1136
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,359
Is this my horse?

1137
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,149
It's not my horse.

1138
01:24:12,029 --> 01:24:12,750
Fuck.

1139
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:27,149
Where's my horse?

1140
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:27,869
He's coming.

1141
01:24:27,869 --> 01:24:35,770
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.

1142
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,500
All right, let's make it up.

1143
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:41,449
You are a wanted lawman and I'm searching for you.

1144
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:42,810
They ain't going to find me.

1145
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,569
Because I'm almost out of the GTA circle.

1146
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:46,350
All right, we're good.

1147
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:50,640
Evade the law by escaping from the red search area, which is what I did.

1148
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,279
Oh, not yet.

03:36:29,639 --> 03:36:33,340
you got quite a ride ahead of us lead the way

2033
03:36:33,340 --> 03:36:36,299
so like this i don't want this horse to die

2034
03:36:36,299 --> 03:36:39,979
but i want to test out its speed zero to sixty

2035
03:36:45,559 --> 03:36:49,399
this is quick i just hope i can remember how to get there

2036
03:36:49,399 --> 03:36:53,399
back into the mountains i sure didn't figure on that

2037
03:36:53,399 --> 03:36:58,079
but this time we're doing the chasing i fucking hate the tail

2038
03:36:58,079 --> 03:37:03,360
why so how are things with you and what's wrong with it

2039
03:37:03,360 --> 03:37:07,040
i mean it kind of looks like a scorpion tail but that's fine

2040
03:37:07,040 --> 03:37:11,200
i'll say it he ditched us for a goddamn

2041
03:37:11,200 --> 03:37:16,319
youth i've spoken to him many times he knows he did wrong

2042
03:37:16,319 --> 03:37:19,040
he just wants to put it behind the tail is fine

2043
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:23,200
i'm sure he does it just looks like there's a snake up its ass

2044
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:27,120
is one thing but there's a cold he knows that

2045
03:37:27,120 --> 03:37:31,440
he ain't trolling dungeon you pretty much raised

2046
03:37:31,440 --> 03:37:37,079
i know but it's done has been for a while now

2047
03:37:37,079 --> 03:37:41,159
if it dies i lose it forever well then that's

2048
03:37:41,159 --> 03:37:48,459
very good reason for me to keep it alive

2049
03:37:48,459 --> 03:38:00,489
long hair it's the color not the braid get

2050
03:38:00,489 --> 03:38:08,569
gold okay time to go i think we need to head right up here

2051
03:38:08,569 --> 03:38:20,920
we're gonna go up all the way up yes i remember

2052
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:25,799
i'm not in control anymore am i

2053
03:38:26,040 --> 03:38:34,510
what's what's wrong with my golden tail red hair

2054
03:38:34,510 --> 03:38:40,750
do i prefer flathead screwdriver or phillips well depends on what the

2055
03:38:40,750 --> 03:38:53,719
scenario is we made it let's loop around the other side

2056
03:38:53,719 --> 03:38:57,000
you can't have a favorite screwdriver depends on how big it is you know this

2057
03:38:57,000 --> 03:39:00,600
this screwdriver is a phillips head i can't undo my table without a

2058
03:39:00,600 --> 03:39:02,680
phillips head might as well go get a flathead

2059
03:39:02,680 --> 03:39:07,069
no i mean phillips head definitely is cooler but

2060
03:39:07,069 --> 03:39:22,170
did i do cinematic centrist streamer is scared to take a side

2061
03:39:22,170 --> 03:39:26,729
maybe we should catch one to cook sure try and shoot one

2062
03:39:26,729 --> 03:39:30,889
you don't want to use anything too powerful on a small animal like that

2063
03:39:30,889 --> 03:39:36,489
just ruin the meat you can probably put a paint can with a flathead

2064
03:39:36,489 --> 03:39:45,149
you can probably put a paint can with a hammer as well

2065
03:39:45,149 --> 03:39:50,760
slow down well there they all are i did i thought that we were still in a

2066
03:39:50,760 --> 03:40:23,719
cut scene why don't they just i got one

2067
03:40:23,799 --> 03:40:34,000
not very smart rabbits i will say you are correct on that

2068
03:40:38,520 --> 03:40:42,909
that's it we should camp here oh i thought we were going home

2069
03:40:42,909 --> 03:40:57,280
now that's it get it set up well i'm finished

2070
03:40:57,280 --> 03:41:02,959
cook that rabbit then they're delicious on an open fire like this

2071
03:41:02,959 --> 03:41:09,129
just like monster hunter right to spin it however i've been in this menu

2072
03:41:09,129 --> 03:41:11,760
it's just teaching me how to be in the menu

2073
03:41:11,760 --> 03:41:28,889
and cook six of this plain game let's go can i burn it

2074
03:41:28,889 --> 03:41:34,940
i don't like eating this late okay after all that

2075
03:41:34,940 --> 03:41:38,780
so i'm gonna eat a whole rabbit myself i guess i probably could do that

2076
03:41:38,780 --> 03:42:02,139
i could probably eat a whole rabbit put this one away

2077
03:42:02,139 --> 03:42:06,639
rabbits are 30 pounds are you sure about that

2078
03:42:06,639 --> 03:42:19,770
no they're not 30 pounds is is like a medium-sized dog a rabbit is like

2079
03:42:19,770 --> 03:42:28,299
maybe two pounds this isn't a shibu inu what do they call

2080
03:42:28,299 --> 03:42:39,879
is shiba shiba inu a rabbit is how many

2081
03:42:39,879 --> 03:42:44,829
pounds is a rabbit siri how many pounds is a rabbit how

2082
03:42:44,829 --> 03:42:55,319
much does a rabbit weigh how much does a rabbit weigh okay let's see

2083
03:42:55,319 --> 03:42:58,600
ranging from adult domestic rabbits can have a healthy weight ranging from

2084
03:42:58,600 --> 03:43:17,600
two to eleven pounds two pounds eleven pounds that's huge

2085
03:43:17,600 --> 03:43:21,280
that's a hare that's not even a rabbit first like to find this

2086
03:43:21,280 --> 03:43:28,649
monster choose time to sleep until sleep until morning

2087
03:43:28,649 --> 03:43:36,200
he better be worth all this drama eleven pound

2088
03:43:36,200 --> 03:43:47,770
absolute unit rabbit five five you ready

2089
03:43:47,770 --> 03:43:56,959
oh give me a minute coffee sure there you go

2090
03:43:56,959 --> 03:44:01,440
so what's your plan well we'll see if we can track them

2091
03:44:01,440 --> 03:44:04,639
but we might need to lay bait to draw them out

2092
03:44:04,639 --> 03:44:07,520
i want one of those cups obviously but they all can you get one of those one

2093
03:44:07,520 --> 03:44:10,799
of those old school tin cups i'll drink out of that every day

2094
03:44:10,799 --> 03:44:13,920
shoot from the trees but i prefer to hunt on the ground

2095
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:17,840
more dangerous but we'll have a much better chance of getting

2096
03:44:17,840 --> 03:44:21,680
good shot in and if he bolts we can start right off after

2097
03:44:21,680 --> 03:44:25,920
why is my author arthur santa because halloween was yesterday and now

2098
03:44:26,639 --> 03:44:30,680
it's christmas time tie it up in that rag when you're done

2099
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:37,129
i hope you know what you're talking about i grew up in the mouth

2100
03:44:37,129 --> 03:44:41,209
predator bait it's like the potent predator bait recipe

2101
03:44:41,209 --> 03:44:45,290
who's arthur that was virtually weaned on bear meat

2102
03:44:45,290 --> 03:44:52,590
okay i think i got this done good pack up and we'll get going i gotta

2103
03:44:52,590 --> 03:45:07,450
shave okay let's go so how are we gonna

2104
03:45:07,450 --> 03:45:12,000
take down we're gonna bait him this is my horse

2105
03:45:12,000 --> 03:45:14,959
okay yeah i can always tell that's where i saw him last

2106
03:45:14,959 --> 03:45:19,360
okay how's that horse treating you so far so good

2107
03:45:19,360 --> 03:45:23,520
you know i was in this area with bessie

2108
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:29,870
years ago really i don't i imagine you still miss her

2109
03:45:29,870 --> 03:45:34,030
every day did you two ever think about

2110
03:45:34,030 --> 03:45:38,270
fix the audio hold on is it really like an audio syncing problem right

2111
03:45:38,270 --> 03:45:41,149
now or am i getting yelled at for no reason

2112
03:45:41,149 --> 03:45:45,340
you should be hearing like dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

2113
03:45:45,340 --> 03:46:01,790
do a test with the gun this is a better test right when you see the

2114
03:46:01,790 --> 03:46:13,770
highlight it should go it's a half second behind it wasn't

2115
03:46:13,770 --> 03:46:30,520
it normal the beginning of the stream the audio is playing first hold on

2116
03:46:30,520 --> 03:46:42,649
let me try this that's weird tell me if this fixes it

2117
03:46:42,649 --> 03:46:58,030
already i wonder why that happened that's weird

2118
03:46:58,030 --> 03:47:02,110
because it wasn't doing that in the beginning i don't know why i'm

2119
03:47:02,110 --> 03:47:04,590
just desyncing after playing for like three or four

2120
03:47:04,590 --> 03:47:14,840
hours it's weird okay let's go now we did briefly

2121
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:20,989
you don't remember guess you were still young i had my sound off

2122
03:47:20,989 --> 03:47:25,870
how would you know there was a problem she understood she knew what i was

2123
03:47:25,870 --> 03:47:31,799
i've been around for a while things were looser back then

2124
03:47:31,799 --> 03:47:35,959
truth is there's never really any getting out

2125
03:47:36,440 --> 03:47:40,280
audio is at the wrong angle i gotta like tilt my audio

2126
03:47:40,280 --> 03:47:45,260
but bessie and i made it work you thinking about getting out

2127
03:47:45,260 --> 03:47:49,180
me no of course not you can braid your horse's tail yep

2128
03:47:49,180 --> 03:47:52,459

2776
05:36:31,840 --> 05:36:34,560
restaurant and you just go there for some reason

2777
05:36:34,560 --> 05:36:38,799

don't pay if you just sit there and you go to

2780
05:36:44,400 --> 05:36:48,080

and i'm not a feller to pass a quick judgment and i've been around

2784
05:36:59,759 --> 05:37:05,880
long enough to never sink to catch a sinner that's that trope

2785
05:37:05,880 --> 05:37:09,240
you're gonna be working in the back of the kitchen and i won't ask no question

2786

there was no money so what is it you need why don't you

2787
05:37:14,330 --> 05:37:17,770
have a look at that poster on the wall over there

05:38:03,610 --> 05:38:11,180

buy some stuff i have a 97 dollar fucking person tab

2802
05:38:22,319 --> 05:38:39,580
because all the people i murdered is it worth buying a ps4 to play

2803
05:38:39,580 --> 05:38:42,830
this game well it's definitely worth buying a

2804
05:38:42,830 --> 05:38:45,229
ps4 in general because it has some of the best

2805
05:38:45,229 --> 05:39:00,860
games of this generation that is uh that is a fact

2806
05:39:00,860 --> 05:39:16,080

2811
05:39:37,740 --> 05:39:41,840
games that come out in years bloodborne is the best game to come

2812
05:39:41,840 --> 05:39:46,279

to be baltimore's finest ever gunslinger

2889

06:00:00,360 --> 06:00:03,560
weeks afterwards i called comcast to get

2993
06:00:03,560 --> 06:00:06,840
uh internet back but there's just a pre-recorded message saying to go on the

2994
06:00:06,840 --> 06:00:10,200
website to contact someone so someone would come out

2995
06:00:10,200 --> 06:00:12,200
but we couldn't do that because no internet

2996
06:00:12,200 --> 06:00:15,000
we still don't have internet i'm out of town and happen to catch you live

fuck comcast uh comcast i went from comcast to cox

3000
06:00:30,520 --> 06:00:37,150
and i'll be honest with you the what ain't much different unfortunately

3001
06:00:37,150 --> 06:00:40,750
like 80 to 90 percent of the entire country

3002
06:00:40,750 --> 06:00:44,189
is is made up of about three or four different companies

3003
06:00:44,189 --> 06:00:48,270
and it's just pick your poison of the companies that

3004
06:00:48,270 --> 06:00:54,590
actually care and give lightning fast stable service

3005
06:00:54,590 --> 06:00:58,029
they're only in little bits and bobs in the country

3006
06:00:58,919 --> 06:01:03,319
horizon files for example i will i will shill and praise the fuck out of them

3007
06:01:03,319 --> 06:01:06,279
every time they're only in a few places they're

3008
06:01:06,279 --> 06:01:09,959
only in like the northeast and then some sections uh out like

3009
06:01:09,959 --> 06:01:15,080
they can new york maybe uh google fiber that's you can't

3010
06:01:15,080 --> 06:01:19,240
nobody can i have this theory that google fiber doesn't exist

3011
06:01:19,240 --> 06:01:23,319
and everyone like oh yeah this place has google fiber

3012
06:01:23,319 --> 06:01:27,389
does it anybody have it no it's just there

3013
06:01:27,389 --> 06:01:33,099
it's in the middle of like texas somewhere you have it

3014
06:01:33,099 --> 06:01:37,799
well i'm glad somebody does but there are like a handful of internet

3015
06:01:37,799 --> 06:01:42,270
companies that aren't just the big box like best buy

3016
06:01:42,270 --> 06:01:45,470
internets but it's it's almost impossible to

3017
06:01:45,470 --> 06:01:50,669
avoid them when looking for places i've actually seen a quite a few

3018
06:01:50,669 --> 06:01:54,990
people comment on this about well why did you why did you move

3019
06:01:55,069 --> 06:02:01,869
to a place that has bad internet it there i mean it's not like it was an

3020
06:02:01,869 --> 06:02:05,229
easy thing to be like oh hey i'm gonna move into a house

3021
06:02:05,229 --> 06:02:09,950
and before i purchase a house or before i sign a lease agreement

3022
06:02:09,950 --> 06:02:14,110
i'm gonna buy internet install it and test it

3023
06:02:14,110 --> 06:02:19,639
that's just that you can't do that that's impossible

3024
06:02:19,639 --> 06:02:23,000
all you can do is just check speeds and check on

3025
06:02:23,000 --> 06:02:27,799
you know low where where location wise and how new is the infrastructure and

3026
06:02:27,799 --> 06:02:30,919
you can't like go move into a house and then buy internet and test it and then

3027
06:02:30,919 --> 06:02:32,919
oh you know internet doesn't really work that well

3028
06:02:32,919 --> 06:02:36,279
uh please tear by lease in half it's like what

3029
06:02:36,279 --> 06:02:41,759
you can't do that hey dude can i mind if i stream at your house before i

3030
06:02:41,759 --> 06:02:46,139
buy it ask the neighbors or something well here's the problem with that

3031
06:02:46,139 --> 06:02:47,900
because there's so many different packages

3032
06:02:47,900 --> 06:02:52,939
right your neighbor might not even have remotely close to what you need

3033
06:02:52,939 --> 06:02:56,939
so if your neighbor oh yeah like can i test your internet can i knock on your

3034
06:02:56,939 --> 06:03:00,060
door and test your internet i'm like i'm sorry i'm a fucking weirdo i need to

3035
06:03:00,060 --> 06:03:05,099
oh yeah we have 25 down like two up that's not gonna be a that's not

3036
06:03:05,099 --> 06:03:11,639
gonna work you just have to follow speeds and

3037
06:03:11,639 --> 06:03:14,919
the speeds i mean before we had all these

3038
06:03:14,919 --> 06:03:21,209
issues we had we had a gigabit line that's a thousand down it's just a

3039
06:03:21,209 --> 06:03:24,330
question of trying to fit with like okay there's a there's like a

3040
06:03:24,330 --> 06:03:26,970
problem there's like an infrastructural problem

3041
06:03:26,970 --> 06:03:30,569
in this whole like there's like five or six areas

3042
06:03:30,569 --> 06:03:33,529
that have like these major that they're being like fixed and maintained

3043
06:03:33,529 --> 06:03:38,009
and maintenance and uh it seems like it's done you know

3044
06:03:38,009 --> 06:03:45,930
what i'm saying we're this is the first time i've had

3045
06:03:45,930 --> 06:03:51,040
like 6 000 up green light the whole night

3046
06:03:51,040 --> 06:03:57,529
but uh italics and i desperately desperately have been keeping on

3047
06:03:57,529 --> 06:04:01,049
top of this every single day it's actually gotten in the way

3048
06:04:01,049 --> 06:04:04,569
of a lot of other things that we wanted to do

3049
06:04:04,569 --> 06:04:07,849
because it's been every single day we've tried to get it situated and

3050
06:04:07,849 --> 06:04:12,970
fixed and updated and uh it is not uh nothing to do with

3051
06:04:12,970 --> 06:04:16,409
us trying to oh this is not streamed for like three

3052
06:04:16,409 --> 06:04:20,990
weeks so cross your fingers it seems like

3053
06:04:20,990 --> 06:04:24,970
the problem has been solved i hate to say that out loud because

3054
06:04:24,970 --> 06:04:27,209
tomorrow i might wake up and it might be off but

3055

posted on your first stream back again it's too long for twitch so here is

3150
06:12:27,290 --> 06:12:37,869
a screenshot let's see uh this is from this is

3151
06:12:37,869 --> 06:12:40,599
from tingy uh germa i've got some great news

3152
06:12:40,599 --> 06:12:44,599
recently just purchased my first house it's located in the boston area the

3153
06:12:44,599 --> 06:12:49,319
realtor told me it was used to be owned by a short old man who

3154
06:12:49,319 --> 06:12:53,080
used to yell a lot at his computer according to his neighbors apparently

3155
06:12:53,080 --> 06:12:55,319
just before moving out he also invited one of the neighbors over to

3156
06:12:55,319 --> 06:12:59,319
fake party or something he told me that he saw him outside as he got home

3157
06:12:59,319 --> 06:13:02,439
from work and invited him in offered champagne and made dumb jokes

3158
06:13:02,439 --> 06:13:04,439
i got this house for really cheap because it had

3159
06:13:04,439 --> 06:13:15,689
extensive deal anyways how do you move to vegas went smoothly

3160
06:13:15,689 --> 06:13:20,139
can't wait to see what streams you cook up in the future much love

3161
06:13:20,139 --> 06:13:24,009
yeah you had me for the first sentence and then i figured out what was going

3162
06:13:24,009 --> 06:13:28,169
on thank you tingy for the five bucks

3163
06:13:28,169 --> 06:13:30,810
thank you topac for the two bucks you gotta get one of your mods or

3164
06:13:30,810 --> 06:13:34,250
something to figure out why out the way to keep good vods from

3165
06:13:34,250 --> 06:13:37,450
getting deleted playlists or something it's awesome to have them saved

3166
06:13:37,450 --> 06:13:44,459
with chat yeah actually that um i just recently gave sort of the

3167
06:13:44,459 --> 06:13:49,119
go-ahead to that archive channel i talked to

3168
06:13:49,119 --> 06:13:53,439
the that archive channel briefly they've been re-uploading those

3169
06:13:53,439 --> 06:13:58,560
streams pretty much forever and while it's nice to have with chat

3170
06:13:58,560 --> 06:14:01,919
i know that i could probably highlight them and everything but

3171
06:14:01,919 --> 06:14:05,279
to be i would be completely honest with you here when you go to like

3172
06:14:05,279 --> 06:14:09,439
video the videos tab on twitch i kind of

3173
06:14:09,439 --> 06:14:12,319
i kind of like the fact that it's just the last like two months worth

3174
06:14:12,319 --> 06:14:16,240
of streams just because if otherwise it's it's

3175
06:14:16,240 --> 06:14:20,240
like just hundreds just scrolling down

3176
06:14:20,240 --> 06:14:29,630
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of videos potentially

3177
06:14:29,630 --> 06:14:33,069
and they made an extension that you can save chat they're adding an

3178
06:14:33,069 --> 06:14:40,569
extension for it well i'll look into it and i don't

3179
06:14:40,569 --> 06:14:44,889
mean that as like the joking like bullshit thing that i say because

3180
06:14:44,889 --> 06:14:48,319
at one hand i know a lot of people already

3181
06:14:48,319 --> 06:14:53,520
go to that channel you know what i mean like most people are already

3182
06:14:53,520 --> 06:14:58,720
watching that channel and they're like oh hey by the way

3183
06:14:58,720 --> 06:15:02,080
like just don't even go there anymore i feel like that's there's a lot of

3184
06:15:02,080 --> 06:15:04,639
people that probably wouldn't even know that that was happening

3185
06:15:04,639 --> 06:15:09,310
and there's a ton of people that don't even watch this channel live

3186
06:15:09,310 --> 06:15:13,500
you know what i mean i i would actually assume a

3187
06:15:13,500 --> 06:15:18,639
a pretty large majority of people don't actually watch these live

3188
06:15:18,639 --> 06:15:21,040
or if you do you're here for a certain amount of time maybe you're

3189
06:15:21,040 --> 06:15:25,360
here the whole time however that may be but if you

3190
06:15:25,360 --> 06:15:28,639
only know about like oh i know that i can just watch the replays on this

3191
06:15:28,639 --> 06:15:30,880
channel and then you know what if i like just

3192
06:15:30,880 --> 06:15:34,880
randomly you just they just upload just stop happening on that

3193
06:15:34,880 --> 06:15:38,319
channel and then they just announce it like oh it's over

3194
06:15:38,319 --> 06:15:42,159
like yeah it's pulling back to twitch i feel like if it's not broke don't

3195
06:15:42,159 --> 06:15:50,970
fix it at this point right now and two months back with chat and then

3196
06:15:50,970 --> 06:15:55,709
after like the 60 days without chat

3197
06:15:55,709 --> 06:15:58,590
i mean i i just don't think there's anything i necessarily want to do about

3198
06:15:58,590 --> 06:16:07,369
it right now but um if there's an extension coming

3199
06:16:07,369 --> 06:16:11,209
out maybe it can be put on the side i really wish like

3200
06:16:11,209 --> 06:16:15,360
there was an easy way to do that without having to like

3201
06:16:15,360 --> 06:16:20,000
potentially like delete somebody's youtube channel that has like an

3202
06:16:20,000 --> 06:16:22,240
archive of hundreds of streams you know

3203
06:16:22,240 --> 06:16:26,680
and i would never do something like that we talked about it extensively

3204
06:16:26,680 --> 06:16:32,919
for a little while we'll see where it goes but uh

3205
06:16:32,919 --> 06:16:36,040
anyways let's let's keep going here we're getting to the end of this

3206
06:16:36,040 --> 06:16:41,439
section here just over midnight eastern time

3207
06:16:41,439 --> 06:16:44,479
but thank you topac thank you mazy kit for the one dollar it's probably a good

3208
06:16:44,479 --> 06:16:46,720
thing you didn't go to twitchcon because the line was so long that a

3209
06:16:46,720 --> 06:16:49,680
bunch of people didn't even get in also if you live under my bed or

3210
06:16:49,680 --> 06:16:53,900
something you can have google fiber what was i talking about i was talking

3211
06:16:53,900 --> 06:16:57,180
about uh vodz and how twitch deletes them

3212
06:16:57,180 --> 06:17:00,060
after 60 days and that there's a channel that has kept

3213
06:17:00,060 --> 06:17:04,349
pretty much all of them for the last couple of years at least

3214
06:17:04,349 --> 06:17:07,790
uh yeah i didn't go to twitchcon i had no plans to

3215
06:17:07,790 --> 06:17:11,470
i was in the middle of doing all this shit

3216
06:17:11,470 --> 06:17:15,759
there was no time to go to any conventions or any events

3217
06:17:15,759 --> 06:17:24,990
maybe twitchcon next year potentially i mean i'm gonna look close enough

3218
06:17:24,990 --> 06:17:28,639
we'll see i had i did hear that it was a little ridiculous though

3219
06:17:28,639 --> 06:17:32,639
and uh envious that you have google fiber thank you mazy

3279
06:22:36,599 --> 06:22:42,729

3337
06:28:56,360 --> 06:28:59,319
dollar hey germ my dog is injured right now so the stream really

3338
06:28:59,319 --> 06:29:03,000
brightened my day is there a way you can read the bits

3339
06:29:03,000 --> 06:29:06,680
from the past month worth of streams or they lost a time

3340
06:29:06,680 --> 06:29:13,639
okay thanks lots of love uh bye bye uh love you yep uh-huh love you

3341
06:29:13,639 --> 06:29:18,560
uh-huh bye uh well thank you timmy tim tam first of all

3342
06:29:18,560 --> 06:29:20,799
sorry to hear but your dog being injured

3343
06:29:20,799 --> 06:29:25,770
that does not that does not sound good hopefully it's nothing

3344
06:29:25,770 --> 06:29:30,090
too serious but i'm sorry to hear it nonetheless

3345
06:29:30,090 --> 06:29:33,369
uh to answer this second question uh there are all the bits are

3346
06:29:33,369 --> 06:29:37,130
recorded and saved but i i don't think i'm going to go back like a

3347
06:29:37,209 --> 06:29:42,250
month just because i don't think i i don't necessarily have the time right

3348
06:29:42,250 --> 06:29:46,889
now to do that they're there and i think with some

3349
06:29:46,889 --> 06:29:49,610
of this direction that i'm going to take the channel here

3350
06:29:49,610 --> 06:29:53,819
is uh well let's just let's just bring it up for a second

3351
06:29:53,819 --> 06:29:57,099
remember i told you guys about like the podcast thing that i want to do

3352
06:29:57,099 --> 06:30:00,299
where a one stream every like couple of weeks is

3353
06:30:00,299 --> 06:30:06,459
there's no game we just hang out for like three or four hours and just

3354
06:30:06,459 --> 06:30:12,409
chill talk about whatever the hell we want no no like oh i'm gonna have like

3355
06:30:12,409 --> 06:30:15,369
guests no just be us just hanging out every couple weeks

3356
06:30:15,369 --> 06:30:21,310
just that's all we do like a like a comb stream yeah

3357
06:30:21,310 --> 06:30:24,830
and portions of that comb stream could just

3358
06:30:24,830 --> 06:30:30,459
be you know going back and making sure i pick up the ones that i missed

3359
06:30:30,459 --> 06:30:33,020
that usually ends up that's usually what ends up happening anyways but

3360
06:30:33,020 --> 06:30:36,700
going into it without anything else uh it starts

3361
06:30:36,700 --> 06:30:39,500
that way and if we could like come up with

3362
06:30:39,500 --> 06:30:44,540
topics and shit to talk about i don't know i feel like i i like doing this

3363
06:30:44,540 --> 06:30:48,380
kind of thing but it feels this kind of there's

3364
06:30:48,380 --> 06:30:50,139
gonna be a lot there's gonna be changes

3365
06:30:50,139 --> 06:30:55,439
made to this channel uh not anything drastic but

3366
06:30:55,439 --> 06:31:00,599
i think i would much rather because let's be frank

3367
06:31:00,599 --> 06:31:06,430
the this is just the end of a stream right

3368
06:31:06,430 --> 06:31:09,630
very at the end of a stream the stream is over played red dead

3369
06:31:09,630 --> 06:31:14,090
and here we are doing like this whole thing right

3370
06:31:14,090 --> 06:31:18,569
i would much rather have this be a like a focus

3371
06:31:18,569 --> 06:31:23,740
like three or four times a month you know what i mean

3372
06:31:23,740 --> 06:31:27,099
instead of it being and i'm gonna use this word in quotes here

3373
06:31:27,099 --> 06:31:36,009
like tacked on at the end of a stream if that makes any sense

3374
06:31:36,009 --> 06:31:47,500
talking to chat comb cast comb cast oh god

3375
06:31:47,500 --> 06:31:51,180
but it wouldn't just be stream over sign there would be things to talk

3376
06:31:51,180 --> 06:31:53,900
about there'd be things to show and things to do

3377
06:31:53,900 --> 06:31:58,409
but i i much prefer that over oh how many how did i read that person

3378
06:31:58,409 --> 06:32:00,490
how did i read that i gotta make sure i read that you know i

3379
06:32:00,490 --> 06:32:03,610
it i don't i don't want it to feel like this rushed kind of tacked on

3380
06:32:03,610 --> 06:32:06,330
oh i got an hour to like blow through a bunch of people that gave me a shit

3381
06:32:06,330 --> 06:32:09,529
lot of money you know what i mean i'd rather it be

3382
06:32:09,529 --> 06:32:12,490
taking our time because people say dude when you do the bits man if you

3383
06:32:12,490 --> 06:32:16,330
just read right through them in 40 minutes it'd be fine but i like

3384
06:32:16,330 --> 06:32:19,930
talking about all this shit i like giving each one of these as much as

3385
06:32:19,930 --> 06:32:22,330
attention as i can and maybe we would make it a thing that we i just

3386
06:32:22,330 --> 06:32:35,790
we just did so a bit stream no no i mean like just

3387
06:32:35,790 --> 06:32:39,150
the hangout portion of the after streams is what i'm talking about

3388
06:32:39,150 --> 06:32:45,919
but that it wouldn't be something that would happen every other day it

3389
06:32:45,919 --> 06:32:52,409
would be you know once a week or once every other week

3390
06:32:52,409 --> 06:32:56,959
germ is designated give me money so i'll talk to you streams

3391
06:32:56,959 --> 06:33:00,810
and then on top of that there are i haven't really mentioned this

3392
06:33:00,810 --> 06:33:02,729
because i haven't really had an opportunity to be to be live for

3393
06:33:02,729 --> 06:33:07,849
more than like an hour or two but i currently all the all the

3394
06:33:07,849 --> 06:33:11,770
stuff that i've been talking about over the last couple of years

3395
06:33:11,770 --> 06:33:18,250
is is real now because at this moment right now i have a studio in vegas

3396
06:33:18,250 --> 06:33:21,930
that i'm going to be working exclusively with and it is a full

3397
06:33:21,930 --> 06:33:25,529
studio sound stages green screens and i've

3398
06:33:25,529 --> 06:33:27,209
already toured them i've already talked to them

3399
06:33:27,209 --> 06:33:31,290
multiple times so like all that shit that i've always wanted to do

3400
06:33:31,290 --> 06:33:35,930
is going to start happening so the stream is going to start to take

3401
06:33:35,930 --> 06:33:39,049
some different directions because that stuff is going to be available for me to

3402
06:33:39,049 --> 06:33:41,689
do and i want it i want something like

3403
06:33:41,689 --> 06:33:45,689
that to happen more potentially once a month or more

3404
06:33:45,689 --> 06:33:48,959
than once a month so dynamically we're going to have to

3405
06:33:48,959 --> 06:33:56,220
start to change how this stream is presented right

3406
06:33:56,220 --> 06:33:59,500
and we'll figure that out as we go it's not something that i i have no

3407
06:33:59,500 --> 06:34:02,060
oh yeah this is what's going to happen and this is this is final and

3408
06:34:02,060 --> 06:34:04,619
i'm never going to play red dead 2 ever again

3409
06:34:04,619 --> 06:34:12,270
green screen stream monthly we talked about this in

3410
06:34:12,270 --> 06:34:17,290
in depth about the direction that i want to take the channel and slowly over

3411
06:34:17,290 --> 06:34:21,869
time i'd like to make it a reality and the internet's

3412
06:34:21,869 --> 06:34:30,459
dying uh-oh oh we still live that was uh that was a

3413
06:34:30,459 --> 06:34:37,950
full-on that was a full-on drop there we're back

3414
06:34:37,950 --> 06:34:45,880
we're here uh just kind of shit the bed for about

3415
06:34:45,880 --> 06:34:53,659
two seconds there pause and unpause all right well uh that might that's

3416
06:34:53,659 --> 06:34:55,979
like that's like the curt that's like the curt why did i just the

3417
06:34:55,979 --> 06:34:58,459
first time i've heard that noise all stream

3418
06:34:58,459 --> 06:35:01,020
that's the first time i've heard that fucking noise the entire stream and it

3419
06:35:01,020 --> 06:35:05,340
just scared me uh anyways that's i think that's like

3420
06:35:05,340 --> 06:35:07,819
the curtain call here the cane is coming out to try to

3421
06:35:07,819 --> 06:35:11,020
drag me off the stage so let me let me get through the bits

3422
06:35:11,020 --> 06:35:16,279

3456
06:37:48,029 --> 06:37:50,909
town radio station and we often have technical difficulties including the

06:37:50,909 --> 06:37:54,029
internet going out tonight your original red deep redemption

06:37:57,310 --> 06:38:00,990
the pain and stress be encouraged that even when things go

3460
06:38:00,990 --> 06:38:02,830
badly it helps others know that they aren't alone

3461
06:38:02,830 --> 06:38:08,330
thanks for the entertainment yeah mint i think

3462
06:38:08,330 --> 06:38:12,860

yeah it sucks it sucks being at the mercy of

3464
06:38:17,259 --> 06:38:19,979
uh here's and here's the problem being the mercy of a bunch of

3465
06:38:19,979 --> 06:38:23,099
companies that just as long as they get their

3466
06:38:23,099 --> 06:38:26,700
monthly fucking sign up paychecks from the

3467
06:38:26,700 --> 06:38:34,409
millions of customers and they don't who cares right that's the problem

3468
06:38:34,409 --> 06:38:42,569
it's unfortunate because there are like so many things that could just be fixed

3469
06:38:42,569 --> 06:38:45,689
if it wasn't just like quick quick quick quick quick how many signups did

3470
06:38:45,689 --> 06:38:50,330

06:38:55,130 --> 06:38:57,689
two internets and tell them that they need two tvs too

and how many signups is that that sir that's that's 1.2 million signups

3475
06:39:01,610 --> 06:39:03,529
how do you want to have to get more signups

3476
06:39:03,529 --> 06:39:06,889
um i did there's no more people we'll make some more people up

3477
06:39:06,889 --> 06:39:10,250
start putting internet in the fucking dirt and give it to the bugs

3478
06:39:10,250 --> 06:39:23,819

internet it might take a while it might you
