00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:16,079
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here. You haven't seen me in a while, but you know what? Fuck you.

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,079
We're going to do something today that I've been seeing on the internet for a while, and it's draw my thing.

3
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:30,559
No, it's my life. Draw my life. It's where you draw pictures. Just draw pictures of your life from when you were a baby,

4
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,560
and you tell a story about how you were born and stuff.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,560
And I figured that you would want to know this because I'm the most important person in your life, so here we go.

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:51,229
Ahem. So the story of my life goes like this. I was born Hilfred J. Steelehelm, the strongest baby on Earth.

7
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:59,469
And that's because Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all had sex with each other, and I was the resulting baby.

8
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:12,140
Get mad. Get jealous, bro. It was a tough life being a super baby sidekick, going on adventures, saving lives, until it would depress.

9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:21,140
But I loved it. We were all such a happy family until one day my parents died on a roller coaster ride.

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,140
And I died too. I forgot that part. And in heaven, God told me I had a bigger purpose.

11
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:35,140
He said, I'm going to give you mortality and send you back to Earth to solve the world's problems.

12
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:46,379
And I said, OK, send me back Roger that. And I arrived in a basket at the Denver School for Baby Ninja Frog People.

13
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:55,379
And I befriended the frogs. And they said, thank you. And I said, except for one frog named Timmy. He used to make fun of me.

14
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,379
I killed him. He's dead. He's been dead for 70 years. Holy shit, has it really been that long?

15
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:08,740
Let me look at my calendar here. It is. There's German's birth. There's my birthday.

16
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:15,919
Well, really, it's been like 82 years since I killed Timmy. Hope his parents aren't that mad at me. Whatever. Let's get back into this.

17
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:25,159
So I got a job selling old shoes or you can put whatever you want here, because I didn't have a job for the last like probably 40 years.

18
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:31,159
I got a job at the fishing dock. I was the guy that peeled all the fish's scales off. I used to eat them.

19
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:38,849
It might be weird to a lot of you guys, but do you think I give a fuck? And then came my adult life.

20
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:52,330
You've never seen quite an action packed adventure like this one. Gather your friends and explore the wonderful land of Azeroth.

21
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,949
I actually don't remember half of my adult life, so I just read the back of the Warcraft box.

22
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:09,500
So my death was on June 24th, 2002. I fell out of an airplane and Insta-died on the concrete.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Made my way back into heaven. And here's the funny story, guys. I was in Moses's science class. And guess who sits behind me but God himself.

24
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I walked up to him after class at his locker and I just simply asked him, God, you know, could I have like five more years on Earth?

25
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:33,169
And I had to trade my fucking Lunchables for it. But I'm here. And it's, wait a second, 2002, three, four, five, six, seven.

26
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:43,469
I should have, I should be, I should have died in 2007. What the fuck is going on? Wait a minute. Is it 2007 right now?

27
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:48,680
Jeremy! Jeremy, come down here for a second.

28
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,939
What? What do you want?

29
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,939
What's a year today? Like, what, 2005?

30
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,939
It's 2013, grandpa.

31
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,939
2013!

32
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,939
Jesus.

33
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,939
I'm supposed to be dead!

34
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:02,939
Dead? What?

35
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:10,939
Oh, hold on a minute. Call your mother. Call your mother. We gotta, she will see some fucking warlock that set all this up.
