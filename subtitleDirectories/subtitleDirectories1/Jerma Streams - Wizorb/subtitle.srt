1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:12,519
Okay, so I think what I want to do is I want to play the game. I want to play the game

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:26,920
that I was gonna play instead of this. I want to play Wizorb, another requested game. It looks

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,030
like a lot of fun, and it's a good, I think, little short little game just to play in the meantime.

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:46,539
It's, we made a reference to it during Nancy Drew. Just chill out for a little bit. I'm gonna give

5
00:00:46,539 --> 00:01:00,070
it a try. Let's open it right now. If I can get, where's my library? Diablo II. I do want to

6
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,750
actually play Diablo II. I want to play Diablo II on hardcore and keep that character alive as

7
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:13,590
best as I can. And if the character, you know, that's it, hardcore. Try to keep that character

8
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,040
going. Maybe jump in random servers with people. But I don't want to boost, I know, I don't want

9
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:30,120
to do a thing where you join the cowl level 10 times or you join the tombs 10 times. You do

10
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:37,750
Tristram 30 times in a row and you level up 40 times. I want to do it legit. But anyways,

11
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:43,640
I'm gonna play Wizorb. It was in the recommended channel and it actually looks cute. It looks very

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,079
cute. It looks very fun. We'll see. I'm gonna give it a chance. It looks pretty good. And good thing

13
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:59,379
I turned that volume off because holy shit, I would have just hurt a lot of people. You can

14
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:08,150
probably hear it through. It looks like Game Boy. Okay, hold on. Look what was said about you. Hold

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:18,500
on. I'll look at it in a sec. No vibration. Full screen on. Paddle speed. What am I supposed to do?

16
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:33,719
40%? This is still loud. 20%? Yeah, it's still loud as fuck. Hold on, I'll look at it. Beat Dark

17
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:40,810
Souls real quick. Um, I, no, I don't think so. Let me get this captured. Can this be captured?

18
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:52,900
Let's hope so. Let's hope so. What was it? Let me see that clip to people spamming this clip.

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:11,159
What was said about me? What did Joel say? Let's see. All right. What does he say? He's like

20
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:19,939
stretching something over my face. Did he trace my, what did he trace over my face? What the hell is

21
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:39,180
this? That's not even that funny. That's not even funny. Oh, this is kind of funny. Hold on,

22
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,469
hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Let me just get this captured first. He thinks it's his real face. He

23
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:52,650
thinks that, no, I don't. I mean, it could have been. Wizard Orb. You guys are gonna like this.

24
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,370
Look at how cute this is. Look at how fucking cute this is. All right. I gotta show this shit

25
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:04,199
because everybody wants to fucking laugh out loud.

26
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:45,079
Everyone's just laughing out loud about it. Okay. I gotta also do this. It's being stretched.

27
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:52,199
It's being stretched. It's being stretched. All right. I'll see you soon. Bye. Thank you.

28
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,120
All right. I'm going to, the image is being stretched. I got to change this.

29
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,839
Uh, let's do, it's called Wizard Orb, right? I think I got a prediction here. I think you guys

30
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:18,709
are gonna really like this game. This is like a breakout. Breakout. I think I'm gonna like this

31
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:28,230
game. Time to get addicted. Let's go. Uh, new quest. Difficulty. What do we do? Easy. No. Ah,

32
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,790
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I wanted to do normal. Oh no. Back it up. Back it up. No, no, no, no, no,

33
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:44,439
no, no. I got to turn it, but I just found out it's too loud. Let's turn that down.

34
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:59,420
Shit, it's fucking loud. All right. New quest. Yes, I'm sure. Is hard. Let's just, let's just do

35
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:16,620
normal. How hard is hard? I wonder how hard hard is. Hmm. All right. I'll try. How do you control it?

36
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:31,720
Oh shit. I have to hit the bears? Wait, I can shoot? Oh, I think I can only do that. So wait,

37
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,199
I can only do that a little. I think I just wasted all of it. It's all gone.

38
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:48,259
Yeah, that's all gone. God damn it. It's breakout. Yeah. This is sick. Thank you for helping us.

39
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,259
The citizens of Taro are the only ones to have escaped the curse cast by demons.

40
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,810
However, monsters came from Gerudo castle and attacked our town. Please save the kingdom of

41
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:06,730
Gerudo. All right. Go ahead. I can wait. I can walk around too. The mayor cares more for his

42
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,810
citizens than for himself. I'd rebuild his house if I had the funds. Donate 999 GP.

43
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:21,269
I don't have that. Once united, the four sacred children of Gerudo have the power of summoning

44
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:27,509
the forces of nature. They could help us if we could find them. All right. This is fucking

45
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:36,230
pogchamp if I've ever seen one. Does he have to like rebuild shit? All right. Let's go. I can't

46
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,550
do any business without a nice shop. What shall I do? Donate 700. I don't have that. All right.

47
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:49,420
This is all upgradable. It's already got me. It's already got me. All right. Those little cows are

48
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:56,569
so cute. It would be a shame if they got lost and hurt themselves. Yeah. All right. Again, 100 GP.

49
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,899
Please accept this reward as a token of my gratitude. You got a key.

50
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:09,129
Well, you're welcome. All right. What about you? What does a poor peasant like me do without his

51
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:18,920
farm and his land? Donate 350. All right. I need to get GP. Time to unbox. Without a watermill,

52
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:25,610
we can't produce flour. People are starving. Look, I can only do one thing at a time here. All

53
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:45,909
right. How do I leave? Do I just leave? Oh, shit. All right. Clover village. Oh, all right. Let's

54
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:59,860
do it. This is it. This is where we get money. I don't have any fire left. All right. Hold on.

55
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,460
What am I doing? Okay. My brain is freaking out. It's just mouse. It's just the mouse.

56
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm doing like WASD. You can move it with WASD. Okay. I got fireballs now. Can I break them?

57
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,519
You can break them with the fireball. Holy shit. All right. This is overwhelming me. This is fun.

58
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,700
I actually like this. Yep. All right. It's on hard. Fuck. It's on hard. All right. All right.

59
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,820
It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. Continue. Continue. I only have three continues. What?

60
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:37,850
Not rich is rich. Oh, okay. Hold on. Hold on. Re, um, reach. Do I only have three continues ever?

61
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:48,649
All right. Don't mess with me. Oh my God. Why am I so, I'm like, I'm so overexcited and shit.

62
00:09:48,649 --> 00:10:11,419
Like, what's wrong with me? I'm freaking out. All right. I got the bad guy. Am I getting, am I

63
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:27,850
getting GP? Holy fuck. That was close. I can break the last two over here. It's got, the ball moves

64
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:46,629
really fast. Got it. All right. Oops. So red rupees 10 GP. Cool. That's level one. All right.

65
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,710
I got to get it up in the top. So it bounces on top of everything. Here we go. Ready?

66
00:10:51,669 --> 00:11:00,019
First try. Get it. Thank you. And I can't shoot these. So I have to, it has to go up there.

67
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:07,960
What is K? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What did I just do? All right. Well, K does what? Oh, it's wind.

68
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:18,889
It's the right amount. I'm not sure what it does. I just fucking blew that. All right. Let's go.

69
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:28,460
Alter? So you can blow it the other direction?

70
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:43,220
Huh. I see. All right. Well, that was easy. Push me towards the paddle. Is that what's going on?

71
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:55,129
Remember this shit's on heart. Let's go. Where should I go? I'm going to try to go. I'm going to

72
00:11:55,129 --> 00:12:07,340
try to get stuck in the top right. Fucked it up. Sorry. Open the crates. Stay on that right. Stay

73
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:18,309
on the left side. Yeah. When did this game come out? Why did I not know this game existed?

74
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:45,990
Came out in 1980? No, it's not. It's got great sounds too. I have enough to do with the lumber

75
00:12:45,990 --> 00:13:07,580
mill, whatever it is. Maybe I'll do that. Get on there. The farmer? Yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll pick

76
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:18,730
one. 2011 was almost 10 years ago. I know it's ridiculous. I'm making a lot of money though.

77
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,000
Jeremy, this is a fun mini game. Can you please go back to solving the main mystery in Nancy Drew?

78
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:36,580
Nah. Nah, I'm good for now. I only have two more continues though. I'm kind of concerned about

79
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:46,600
that. Did I blow the whole thing? Do I only get three continues the whole game? I wasted all my

80
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:57,480
ammo. Can I sneak it up the side? Yep. Oh, this is, this is nice. I like this. This is relaxing to me.

81
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:13,429
Shit. I missed the coin. Whoa. What just happened? I was like, it's like pinball.

82
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:22,740
All right. Pop it. Pop it off. Do I have any time or is it just whenever I fall?

83
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:34,340
Oh, this is cool. There's like 20 plus hours of Nancy Drew on YouTube now.

84
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:45,240
What do you mean? 20 plus hours? You're talking about from this channel? I mean, yeah.

85
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:55,190
We played three of the games and beaten two of them. I have to be careful though because

86
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,029
if you, there are some Twitch metrics that you can look at and you can see, you can analyze your

87
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:09,029
stream. You can analyze data and all this shit, right? Once you, I don't want to cross the

88
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:21,370
threshold where Nancy Drew is in like the top five of most time on stream. I have to be careful with

89
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,860
that because oh, Nancy Drew, 20 hours. Nancy Drew is like Nancy Drew, 40 hours. Nancy Drew is like

90
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:37,049
180 hours of Nancy Drew that trumps every single game I've ever played. Oh shit. I can press the

91
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:48,600
button and go in. I didn't know that. I'm going to use the fireball here. Right in front. Get in

92
00:15:48,600 --> 00:16:08,009
there. Give me the bonus. Bonus. Give it to me. No. No. Get in there. Does it close? Get in. Get in.

93
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:28,090
Get in. No. Yes. What is this for? 75. Is this a magnet? Let's the orbs stick to the magic one

94
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:35,980
when they collide. Oh, that's pretty good. For 75 though. I don't know about that.

95
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,279
This is just another live. I think I'm going to get replenish his magic. I'm going to get this.

96
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,480
Yeah, that feels, look at my bar. All right. Cool. All right. I'm going to save the rest.

97
00:16:52,200 --> 00:17:16,940
What is this? I don't get it. What did I just do? Is that a curse? Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. What? What's

98
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:42,220
wrong? Are there bosses in this game? Yeah. He doesn't know. What happened? Oh, I had 666 coins.

99
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:51,609
Now I see your concern. It's okay. I'm fine. I feel like I don't want to touch that.

100
00:17:52,569 --> 00:18:10,980
There are other spells available when the ball hits the paddle. Really? Oh shit. There is. What

101
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:20,170
is the, what does K do? Get in there. Get stuck up there. Come on. Get stuck up there. Get in the

102
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:29,460
middle and bounce around all over the place. Oh shit. There is. Oh, it turns into fire.

103
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:38,440
I don't have enough to do it. What is, what's, I don't understand. That's all my magic is gone.

104
00:18:39,160 --> 00:19:01,779
I don't know what that did for the chest though. Get up close. Fairy lets you control the ball. Oh,

105
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:13,380
very cool. Streamer plays mobile game for 6K viewers. This game ain't even, this

106
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,420
ain't even on mobile. What are you on about? You can't even get this on mobile.

107
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:31,059
You should be able to. I feel like it would be hard on mobile. You have to have your finger

108
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:36,390
on the screen just drag back and forth like crazy. I mean, maybe it would not be hard.

109
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:48,869
A lot of money. That was awesome. How is that hard? It just, it is. Your finger gets like

110
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:55,130
greasy and shit and you can't register. By the way, I think this game is like $2. I'm not kidding.

111
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:09,930
This game is like $2 or $3. Tops. No, I can still save it. Just get up there. Get in there. Come on.

112
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:26,579
I can still do it. Yes. No. Get up there. Don't break this. Whatever. It's over. Okay. That's

113
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:36,650
amazing. I just was shocked. That's awesome. It goes through everything. The save up for that one

114
00:20:39,029 --> 00:21:03,130
is literally $3. Yeah. This game is $3. I think I'm playing pretty well. Ooh, that was close.

115
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:20,099
All right. I'm just going to get it. Kill the two bears. There it is. What's left? What is left?

116
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:35,480
Oh, the top left corner. Shit. All right. Let me just box top left. I got it. $4. Wow. This game

117
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:51,539
must be bad. $4 must be awful then. No, if a game, it might be fun. No, I want to. Ooh,

118
00:21:51,619 --> 00:22:09,660
not worth it. I'll buy this. Saving. You're a real stinker. What do you mean?

119
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:21,829
I want the magnet. Well, I want to fix the town up first. I don't want to just go straight for the

120
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:46,569
magnet. I think that's using keys. What about the left door? Get in that left door. All right. I

121
00:22:46,569 --> 00:23:04,779
got to feed it up there. Very gently. Damn it. Jesus. Get up there. Yes. What about the button?

122
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:18,119
I didn't get the button. I feel completely unsatisfied. Oh, I feel terrible right now.

123
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:39,829
All right. Watch this. Jesus. Give me it. Yeah, that's pretty damn good. I don't want to get...

124
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:52,920
What? Teleport spell? I didn't want to get grabbed. I still don't know what the grab does.

125
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:11,539
You're cheating. You lose money. Oh, that's terrible. How much do you lose? I feel like

126
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:29,099
my paddle is smaller. Or am I making that up? Oh my god. I'm not making this up.

127
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:40,180
Sorry, I got plenty of lives. You've always had a small paddle. I don't even know what you're

128
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:58,069
referring to. Keep going. No, no. Turn, turn. Yes. We can just watch the movie play out.

129
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:17,190
Here it is. I don't even have to do shit. Telekinesis achievement. I want to see another

130
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:25,559
scare Saturday. Well, a scary game that I want to play has got to come out. This one's odd. Although

131
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:37,960
I can go straight up. Do I have a key? I've got two keys. Oops. Get in. The same magnet. I feel like

132
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:48,019
I'm trying to get it. I mean, it's just going to be here every time. I'm getting it. And I'm getting

133
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:56,359
the heart. No, I'm not. Yeah. Fuck it. I'll give you the magic. Yeah. All right. I'm up. Should I

134
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:04,440
get the heart too? All right. I got plenty of money. Wait, what? Adds one life. Oh, I can buy

135
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:12,950
this as many times as I want. All right. I'm doing five and I'm up. Watch it. I'm going to sneak it

136
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:22,740
through right there. Does it keep the same trajectory? No, you can actually move it.

137
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:42,980
That's great. Maybe it does. It's not cheating. It's an item in the game. So I got to use

138
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,900
so much magic. I couldn't get them both. You know, I couldn't. Am I in easy mode? Well,

139
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:18,950
this is level one. I have to assume it gets harder after this. Sure it does. Kappa. I actually

140
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:31,259
don't like it. I'm trying to figure out how the trajectory works. So I think it just keeps

141
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:41,740
following. No, it doesn't. I thought it kept following the path. It's based on where it is

142
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,569
on the paddle. That makes sense. So I want to get it on the left side. Like this. And then,

143
00:27:48,569 --> 00:28:07,210
yeah. All right. I feel you. I feel you. Come on. Get over there. Nice. VIP this person? VIP who?

144
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:17,130
Somebody here? I'm falling asleep here. That's all right. We're just chilling.

145
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,059
We're just chilling right now. I'm relaxing. I'm just fucking chilling.

146
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,970
Just lying back. Yeah, this is like pretty nice actually. This is pretty nice to me.

147
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,680
Honestly, all I need right now is just a large pizza. I just want a large pizza.

148
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:53,049
After every level, I take just a huge bite of like this crispy pepperoni pizza. You know what I mean?

149
00:28:55,769 --> 00:29:04,650
I love pizza. I know. Every time somebody, when you ask anyone what their favorite food is

150
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:11,609
from the second to the eighth grade, pizza. But I love pizza. That's seriously the best. One of

151
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:21,660
my favorite things on earth. I would probably still have like the fourth grade answer. French

152
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:42,599
fries? No. Pizza. Pipo happy. Pizza. It's so good though. It really is. I could probably eat pizza

153
00:29:42,599 --> 00:30:02,220
every single day. You know, I could. That sounds bad. I'm just saying. I'm not going to do it,

154
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,109
but I probably could. I'm actually pretty easy to please when it comes to food.

155
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:15,269
I really am. There are people that would say like, man, I mean, I've eaten pizza like four times

156
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:20,150
this week. Fuck that. I want something else. And I'm the guy that's like, yeah, fuck that.

157
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,990
I would eat it again though. If you like wanted to get it, I would eat it. I would eat it every day.

158
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm pretty easy to please. Yeah, fuck that. I've had pizza like three times this week.

159
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,420
Fuck. But I mean, like what else is open? I mean, it's like, we could go to like McDonald's,

160
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,339
but that's like, I mean, what else is open? And we don't have fucking options besides maybe like

161
00:30:48,339 --> 00:31:11,579
pizza. And that's true though. It actually is. But Uber Eats is a thing now. Oh, hold on. We've got

162
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:24,680
a boss battle. Do I have a health bar? How does this work? Holy shit. All right. All right. I got

163
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:55,430
to get like the... I'm wasting these shots. No, we are. All right. Giant wolf. Watch it. Yeah,

164
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:02,410
there aren't many, there really aren't that many foods I could eat every day. But pizza. Uh oh.

165
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:26,869
Very small. Tiny. First boss. Seven lives too. All right. Am I going back to town?

166
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:39,130
There's another slime fort. No, let's go back to town. Kingdom of Gerudo. All right. Who do we,

167
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,440
who do we give money to? I have 1400. I love my tavern. I'll be ruined. I'll miss all the

168
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,079
gossip going around. Donate. Yeah, let's get the tavern going. You just saved my business. Please

169
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:59,220
accept this reward. You got an extra life. All right. Well, we're going to get a tavern.

170
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,579
What is this? An enormous flying eye struck my house with a lightning bolt and burnt it to the

171
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:17,450
ground. Yeah. All right. Let's get your house built. Got a key. Woof woof. Donate to the dog?

172
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:31,740
Barf. You got a key. Let's open up the shop. I need a nice shop. What should I do? All right.

173
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:40,170
I gotta do the shop. Yeah. 750. Shop will be open after I do one more. All right. I got three keys,

174
00:33:40,170 --> 00:34:01,980
eight lives. Let's go to the next area. Slime forest. Level two, one. Wait, do I keep everything

175
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:16,280
from lab? Oh, I do. I keep everything. I still have the magnet. That's pretty awesome. I gotta

176
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:34,039
get in the corner. Get up there. Dammit. Dammit. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come

177
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:55,210
on. Magnet run. Magnet run. Why can't I go in there? Is there a button somewhere missing?

178
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:08,010
Get it. I almost have 10 health. Oh, there's one problem I'm seeing with the magnet. I can't do the

179
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:28,980
fireball. I don't think the fireball is possible to do because it gets stuck. How do I get in that

180
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:42,900
door? Drop the magnet or I'm going to bed. Relax. What? This is just a slime room.

181
00:35:43,860 --> 00:36:05,110
Holy fuck. That was okay. I had to use it. Wait, what's my what happened? My paddle's back to normal.

182
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:12,360
I don't have the magnet anymore. I draw. Okay. You're staying up then. You're not going to bed

183
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:35,380
anymore. You lose whatever you get when you. Oh, that sucks. Okay. Well, good to know. Holy shit,

184
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:55,530
dude. Germ is a god at breakout. I appreciate that. Thank you. What's going on? Oh, I think I just got

185
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:02,659
luigi'd. If it becomes impossible, it just gives it to you. That's pretty cool. I'm going to sneeze

186
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:22,150
though, just to make everyone aware. I do actually like breakout. It's fun. I don't know what that

187
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:36,440
does, but I don't want those bad apparently somehow. Germa, how do you I don't even know

188
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:42,920
what that is. I'm not going to answer it. What do these slimes do? I'm terrified to touch them.

189
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:51,659
Germa, quick. Give me your opinion on this thing. You don't know what it is.

190
00:37:52,710 --> 00:38:17,340
Oh, all right. He knows. He doesn't. He doesn't actually know. I don't know what you're doing.

191
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:34,539
Guys, I didn't know what uh-oh stinky was. Why would I know what anything else is? And yes,

192
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:44,380
I've seen the video. I've seen it. How do you know what ayayaya is? Well, that's easy because

193
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,260
you know how many times I've seen that link put in chats on Twitch?

194
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,460
You know how many times I've been linked that video randomly by people? You know how many times

195
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,619
I've seen that random thing pop up? I've seen those words pop up a hundred times.

196
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:12,789
Apologize. I already did. I said I was sorry like five times.

197
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,619
How many times do I have to apologize? Do I have to apologize every day?

198
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:30,809
Hey everybody. Welcome to another stream. This is stream number 15 since the ayaya incident.

199
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:35,769
Just want to make sure I make this really well aware. I'm really sorry about that.

200
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:57,460
I'm incredibly sorry. I'm embarrassed about it. Ooh, huge paddle. All right, that's good. Is this

201
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:05,050
even any bigger? It doesn't even look that bad. Much bigger. Yeah, I have to apologize every day

202
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:20,619
for saying the... doing the ayayaya thing. I have to say sorry every day. All right, I don't die

203
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:30,360
because you'll lose your power-ups. I have to shoot them. God damn it. Come on. And I didn't

204
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:45,349
even need to do that. Ugh. You have to apologize to God. Apologize on Twitter. I already did my

205
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:56,329
apology. I already said I was sorry. I don't have to... what? I'm not apologizing on Twitter.

206
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,929
That would break my... uh-oh. Get it off. Oh! Now that would break my rule of having

207
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:20,949
like five tweets a year that aren't going live tweets. Get in that cave. It's gonna be a bonus

208
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:40,780
for my Jess. Know it. You have five new tweets? No, I don't. What are you spamming here? Attention

209
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,019
parents and grandparents. Herbal life. Hold on. You're gonna make me pause the game for this.

210
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:52,809
Get in the cave. Fall in cave. Fall in cave. Attention parents. I don't even know what it is.

211
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:11,500
Look at all this money. This is crazy. Oh, I got them all so far. Come on. Keep it going.

212
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:40,440
Get them all. Yep. I'm gonna get them all. Funny memes. Have you ever listened to penis music

213
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:51,420
before? You just replaced a noun with the word penis. That's all you did. I mean, come on. You

214
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:07,460
gotta get a little more effort than that. It's gotta be some more effort than that.

215
00:43:12,219 --> 00:43:15,739
You guys critique my jokes sometimes. It's time to critique yours.

216
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:40,579
Just kidding. I'm not gonna hit that one ever. I got nine lives. I'm gonna be doing just fine.

217
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,639
You cry laughing at fart noises. So did you. Don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.

218
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:10,889
Some of you... I can pretend that you didn't, but you know. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Where'd it go?

219
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:26,420
Wait, is Pac-Maning? It's Pac-Maning. Holy shit. It is Pac-Maning. I don't know. This is perfect.

220
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,059
I don't have to do anything. I'm gonna shoot this one. Didn't even need... All right. No, no, no,

221
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:52,360
no. Get that chest. Yes. Yes. Did a raid just come in? Or am I crazy? Why is it not listed here?

222
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:07,429
Was there a raid? It's not on my... Why is it not on my streamlabs? It's... I mean, it says that...

223
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:26,119
Who came in with the raid? It was a while ago? When was it? Hold on. Where? No, it wasn't. No,

224
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:37,500
this just happened like right now. Why is this... I swear to god, I just saw that a raid came in.

225
00:45:40,969 --> 00:46:03,179
From... from... from GMART? Am I making this up? I swear to god. I'm... I have to be insane. I swear

226
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:11,059
to god, I looked over and I saw it. Thank you for fucking raiding. Seriously. Thanks for the raid.

227
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:28,119
I swear to god this happened. I'm not crazy. No, somebody look up... Is somebody like... Is

228
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,239
somebody hosting this channel right now called like called like GMART or something? It was like

229
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:38,920
600 people. I swear to god. I'm not... I'm not insane. Thank you so much for the raid. Seriously.

230
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,139
No, yeah. Thanks a lot. Seriously. Whatever you were doing, hopefully you had a good time.

231
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:07,059
We're playing. We are playing. I just lost my paddle. Fuck. Uh, we're playing this breakout

232
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:17,750
game. It's only three dollars on Steam. You can do shit like that. Pretty damn cool. Uh, welcome

233
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:32,380
though. Welcome. Get it. Sponsored. Sponsored by a three dollar game. What are you talking about?

234
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:53,829
This was made with passion and love. And they're charging almost nothing for it. Gah! I thought

235
00:47:53,829 --> 00:48:01,349
I was gonna bounce higher. All right, I'm... I can't... I can't get cocky. That was pretty pog

236
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:15,210
champ right there, I'll tell you. That was pog. Yeah, like I said again, welcome.

237
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:25,909
That... I'm saying... I'm saying your name right? GMART, right? GMART. You're so bad at this.

238
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:32,570
But I'm hard. What are you talking about? So why did that not show up in my streamlabs? I saw it

239
00:48:32,570 --> 00:49:09,659
like blow by the chat. That's a lot of free... that... that's two free lives. I wonder how many

240
00:49:09,659 --> 00:49:32,070
levels are in the game. Holy fuck. Another door. Another key. What is this? The orb starts at speed

241
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:51,369
twice slower. Yeah, let's get it. And here's world magic too. Holy shit. Wait. Oh, I didn't

242
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:59,429
want to do that. Yeah, that's too slow. I just increased the time I'm gonna play the game by

243
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:18,409
50% or 100%. That's all I did. More time on stream. Yeah, I don't like this. I want it to be faster.

244
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:30,780
No, I didn't want to do that either. Fuck. I'm gonna... all right, I'm gonna let it fall. I'm gonna

245
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:39,159
let it fall. I'm gonna let it fall. Just fall. I don't want this anymore. I still have it, don't I?

246
00:50:39,880 --> 00:51:01,139
Do I still have it? I get... no, I don't. I feel like this is slower. I know. I'm trying to get it. I

247
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:23,690
can't get it. It's too... it's a weird spot. The reaction times have ascended here. Yeah, just throw

248
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:45,880
coins in the trash. You're right. Unfortunate. Unfortunate. Damn it! I tried. I tried to get this

249
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,039
sneaking in there. Oh, it would have been awesome too. You know, it would have been so cool.

250
00:51:50,920 --> 00:52:16,889
Oh well. I would have eaten everything. How many of you guys got a pizza? Seriously, how many?

251
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:35,820
At least like three of you? Actually you? Good. Explain how it tastes to me. How is it? Like,

252
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:45,000
what is it? Is it crunchy? Is it doughy? Is it deep? Explain it to me in full detail. Is the sauce

253
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,579
tangy? Is the sauce... is it like thin sauce? Is it soupy? You know, don't ever think that a soup pizza

254
00:52:52,579 --> 00:53:00,039
is bad. All right. If you don't get it, me and Burger Boy used to call them soup pizzas because

255
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:05,719
when you got a fresh hot pizza that was so hot that just came out of the oven, where the cheese,

256
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:13,239
the sauce, and the oil all mixed together into this moving lava and you pick up a piece of pizza

257
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:20,019
and it's just... the whole thing is liquid. That's a soup pizza. And don't... don't think that a

258
00:53:20,019 --> 00:53:33,369
soup pizza is not good. It can be very good. Sometimes it's like, all right, this sucks,

259
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:38,409
but it's a soup pizza. It's pretty good. You'll pick up a slice and it all just starts... it's

260
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:43,369
all liquid, all really, really thin, and you have to fold it together and like keep... you can't

261
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:50,300
happen to do this shit. Hold on. Pause it. You keep having to do this shit. Can you guys even see me?

262
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:56,920
You have to... you keep having to do this, right? So you have to keep going like...

263
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:07,449
like fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold over and over again with the cheese. He's handsome?

264
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:21,449
Yes, I am. You'll go in for a bite and everything will start to fall and you put your hand under

265
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:27,210
here and your hand's like accepting hot lava and you like fold it back up on top of the pizza

266
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:33,769
and like... and you keep folding it on top of each other and eating it and eventually you like churn

267
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:45,340
it like butter. That's sometimes... it sucks, but sometimes it's okay. Sometimes it's actually

268
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:59,190
exactly what you're looking for. Worst noise of 2020. Well, I will make sure you clip it because

269
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:19,539
you'll make sure you remember where it is. Dammit, it's not gonna hit it, is it? Yes, it is.

270
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:36,360
Do you own more than three shirts? Yes, I do. These are comfortable. You have no idea how

271
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:43,590
comfortable this... this Nightwing shirt is. You have no idea. It's ridiculous. It is the most soft,

272
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:49,190
wonderful material and it's washed. I wear it a couple times and you wash it. It's the most

273
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:58,489
comfortable... it's one of the most comfortable things I own. Plus, I like to fucking like pretend

274
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:07,670
I'm Nightwing. Not even... not as cool as Batman and I used to be Robin, remember me? But I got two

275
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:19,530
fucking batons now. Cool... it's cooler than Robin and like definitely like... definitely like sexier

276
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:24,409
than Batman. You know what I mean? Nightwing. Bruce Wayne ain't got nothing on me, okay?

277
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:32,860
What's it... what's it... Drew Carey? What's his name? Not Drew Carey. Who is Nightwing?

278
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:44,730
Who is Nightwing? Not Bruce Wayne. I'm talking about Nightwing.

279
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:58,789
Yeah, Drew Carey. Good, good. Drew Carey can be Nightwing if you want.

280
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,280
Did you see how fucking pogchamp that just was? That was the most pog...

281
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:29,500
put... nominate that shit. Watch this. Ready? What is that? Oh my goodness.

282
00:57:31,400 --> 00:58:02,150
Fuck. It's okay. Yeah, Batman's old news. God damn it. I didn't move my hand fast enough.

283
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:17,460
Dude, he's begging for nominations. Eye roll. Uh, me and Joel are gonna play the bomb game. Yes,

284
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:23,909
we were supposed to play it today, but uh he kind of last second got uh ill. I think he was

285
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:29,860
feeling under the weather. So instead of it being... all right let's... we want... we want

286
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:36,099
Joel to be in, you know, peak health while we do that. So he wasn't feeling well. So I just was

287
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:39,219
like, you know what, fine, it's all good. I'll just do something else today and we'll do it tomorrow.

288
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:52,039
Obviously, uh, if Joel's feeling all right. Otherwise we'll do something else. There we go,

289
00:58:52,039 --> 00:59:05,980
get in there. Should I do the bigger paddle? Yeah. And... no, that's fine. Joel's streaking

290
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:13,500
the bomb game right now. Now that would have actually been pretty hilarious. Um, can you

291
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:20,139
imagine if... hey, sorry, um, no, we're not doing it... and then just streaking it with somebody else.

292
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:35,260
You'd be like, oh shit. No, I can assure you that is not the case. I don't like these ice blocks.

293
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:53,659
Don't do it. Neither does... whoa! Whoa! I don't like ice blocks. Oh! And neither does...

294
00:59:56,469 --> 01:00:11,849
oh! Anybody that played WoW PvP back in 2005. Fuck! I tried to stop it. I'm sorry. I fucking

295
01:00:11,849 --> 01:00:16,489
couldn't stop. I couldn't stop it. I couldn't stop it. I had to say... I had... I couldn't stop.

296
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:26,599
I tried to stop. Don't worry, I'll apologize for the next, like, five days straight. Don't worry.

297
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:54,519
You're a psycho. Who said that? Okay, no. I love this game. This game's actually fun.

298
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:06,409
Uh, this is just a fun game just to sit here and just dick around. Come on, get back in there.

299
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:13,239
Is there a button I can press? But no, long story short, yeah, we'll do, uh,

300
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:17,159
keep talking and nobody explodes tomorrow. We're very prepared for it.

301
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:23,340
Like I said earlier, I think a lot of people really are underestimating just how much we're

302
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:30,630
going to be prepared for these streams. Or these stream, whatever it is. I'm going to take it dead

303
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:36,070
serious. Even if he does not take it seriously, I'm going to take it as dead serious as humanly

304
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:41,190
possible. I'm going to try as hard as I can. I'm going to be very clear with my instructions.

305
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,949
I'm not gonna, whoa, what if I say this and like fuck it up?

306
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:57,849
Laugh. Laugh. Uh, nope, not gonna happen. Oh dude, I'm gonna say cut like the blue wire and he's

307
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:01,369
gonna cut it. He's gonna explode and it's gonna be, nope, I'm gonna be trying as hard as I fucking can.

308
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:33,019
Whoa, he actually, he can get attacked? I'm so excited for the explode joke next stream.

309
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:41,050
That's not gonna happen. I mean, maybe, we're probably gonna lose. It's a very complicated

310
01:02:41,050 --> 01:03:08,010
game. Is it dead? Jelly? What did I just get? Keep pogging and nobody explodes. Should I go back?

311
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:23,929
Yeah, let's go back and see what the town looks like now. Oh, look at this. I can go in the houses.

312
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:32,070
Oh, it's the, it's the tavern. This is cool. I guess this has opened up me. Heard that everywhere,

313
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:38,489
else in Gerudo, people turned into ghosts and vanished. Isn't that creepy? Do you sell stuff?

314
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:53,239
Can I play piano? I don't think so. Oh, a chest. Uh, I'm not sure I can do anything with this yet.

315
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:11,769
Dog? Oh, I can't take their, okay. I would have never believed that such a hideous creatures existed

316
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:27,820
if I hadn't seen them with my own eyes. She's talking about you? Can I go to the dog house?

317
01:04:28,619 --> 01:05:14,739
I want to do it too. All right, I did the shop. Let's go to the shop. I already own all this stuff.

318
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:27,159
I'm out. Slow. All right. Uh, farmer? The windmill. Watermill. People are starving. 350. Yes. Thank

319
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:37,820
you. You got an extra life. Good. Uh, can I repair this or provide the entire town with milk? All

320
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:48,679
right, let's fix the farm. 350. Except this, you got an extra life. Cool. Anything else need to be

321
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:54,500
fixed? Couple houses up here. What is this for? The mayor carries more for his citizens than for

322
01:05:54,500 --> 01:06:00,099
himself. I'd rebuild this house if I had the funds. 999. All right, well, I don't have that.

323
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:19,260
All right, well, let's just build this house back up then. Omega low link. I had to like double take

324
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:47,099
for a second here. Bomb game. Don't tell the German. Don't tell him. Don't tell him. Imagine

325
01:06:47,099 --> 01:07:01,480
this is real. Imagine if it was real. Now that would be ridiculous. All right, this is terrible.

326
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:10,230
These monsters took away everything. Here. 250. I got a key. What about you? Do what you need.

327
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,090
How could those monsters destroy a statue? Boo hoo. Donate 500 for the statue. I don't have it.

328
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:22,460
All right, let's go. This buddy gave me these meatballs. One pound spaghetti ground beef.

329
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:28,780
Bread and crumbs. Finally chopped parsley. Freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving.

330
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:43,690
One egg. Two garlic cloves. That sounds gross. I'm making meatballs. They're wrong.

331
01:07:43,690 --> 01:08:08,440
I mean, well, I mean. What does that thing in the middle mean? Stay up there. Get up top. Oh,

332
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:25,210
my fucking hand slipped. It's all right. I don't have any powerups anyways. Greed? Well, yeah,

333
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:47,880
I need that money to rebuild the whole town. Should have saved it. That was dumb. All right,

334
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,600
top five favorite superheroes or super villains. They can both be on the same list. Who are they?

335
01:08:53,479 --> 01:09:04,729
That's a good question. Let's find out. Bator? That's not a superhero. That's just,

336
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:18,420
that's a word that I've said a few times. All right, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

337
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:37,960
Hmm. Shit, this is tough. Who's, what's the, who's the best, coolest? It's too bad because I would

338
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:45,979
have said, I would say Deadpool. But Deadpool has been like meme-ified now. You know what I'm saying?

339
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:50,779
It's very hipster of me to say that. Deadpool is like too popular for me to say that now.

340
01:10:16,069 --> 01:10:28,979
So many people were just like, what the fuck? Fuck you, man. Uh, no, all right, it's probably

341
01:10:28,979 --> 01:10:47,020
Deadpool. Spider-Man, Deadpool. Lame. Stop! I'm trying to have conflicting, backtracking opinions.

342
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:53,369
Stop. Stop, stop it. Don't you understand? I'm, I'm saying something, engaging what everybody

343
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:59,560
says and then I'm just gonna go with what you are all saying and backtrack. I'm gonna make a

344
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,079
statement and then immediately tell you otherwise and see what you guys say and then I'm gonna,

345
01:11:05,079 --> 01:11:22,060
that's what my opinion is gonna be? This guy's fucking smart. No, uh, for real though, no jokes,

346
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:31,779
no bullshit. It's probably Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Uh, it's Spider-Man. It's definitely Spider-Man.

347
01:11:31,779 --> 01:11:36,439
It's Spider-Man. What's cooler than Spider-Man? Nothing's cooler than Spider-Man.

348
01:11:38,789 --> 01:11:42,470
It's not Captain America. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put my foot down there. It's not Captain

349
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:58,810
America. It's Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Venom. Aquaman. No, no, I don't think so. Not for me.

350
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:19,420
Although he makes great t-shirts, but not for a superhero. Um, some of the X-Men too. The problem

351
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:24,619
with the X-Men is the X-Men were so cool and then they made like the last two or three movies were

352
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:35,539
just real bad. So it's kind of, they gotta get the X-Men in somebody else's hands. The actors were

353
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:44,970
fine for the X-Men, I think. Um, when I was younger it was Gambit. What is this? The Magic

354
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:58,300
Wand launches three at once. Oh, fuck yeah. Gambit was my favorite superhero when I was like 14, 15,

355
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:09,880
16. It might still be. They even put Gambit anywhere, really. Besides the cartoon. Okay,

356
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:36,069
this is, I gotta have to show you guys some skill here. Do I get three balls at once forever?

357
01:13:37,609 --> 01:14:06,710
Yeah, I do. All right, I gotta be really, really good here. Bat fucked it up. Sorry. What does Bat

358
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:23,750
even do? Is it taking my health? Wait, is it taking my health? It drains your magic. Ah, that sucks.

359
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:28,920
I'm so happy you get this for every level though. This is great. Not much I could do

360
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:49,369
there. Oh, fuck, that instantly kills you. I mean, yeah, the Avengers are cool. They're,

361
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:57,850
they're all right. They're interesting. Although, is it weird that I really only like those movies

362
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:18,859
because Spider-Man's in them? Even though they're good. I love that latest Spider-Man. That Spider-Man

363
01:15:18,859 --> 01:15:30,649
movies are great. I love them. All of them. They're all so good. Me hate popular thing. Me interesting.

364
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:36,970
Spider-Man is insanely popular. He's like the most popular superhero ever.

365
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:42,310
It's, it's, it's, it's the Deadpool thing that I said, isn't it? People are gonna be mad at me now.

366
01:15:43,189 --> 01:16:09,770
I love, I like Deadpool. I was just fucking, I was just joshing everybody. Super villain though.

367
01:16:10,329 --> 01:16:40,550
Spider-Man superhero. What's the best villain? Freeze? That's not a bad pick. That's not a bad

368
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:58,920
pick. I don't know. Who else though? I like the Riddler. The Riddler's cool because the Riddler

369
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:07,510
doesn't even have any superpowers. He's just a dick. Like the Riddler doesn't have superpowers.

370
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:22,420
He's, he's just like, he's just like a really good lawyer. All right. Get the balls again.

371
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:36,279
He was super intelligent. Yeah, but that's all right. I mean, yeah, that's fine. But

372
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:47,060
Riddler sucks. Just tells shitty puns. I, I was kind of sad when in the Christopher Nolan series,

373
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:51,859
it was Bane. I really thought it was going to be the Riddler and we were going to get a Christopher

374
01:17:51,859 --> 01:17:56,420
Nolan Riddler and that would have been, that would have been awesome. Can you imagine a

375
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:19,420
Christopher Nolan Riddler? Oh, I missed it. I have to keep him alive. Weren't they in talks to maybe

376
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:24,779
do a Riddler? Long time ago. Why do I feel like it was going to be Johnny Depp? Why have I like

377
01:18:24,779 --> 01:18:44,090
heard that somewhere? Am I insane? Jim Carrey? Yeah, but the only Riddler we ever got on TV was

378
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:51,210
or in the movies was the guy from the sixties and Jim Carrey. And although I love Jim Carrey's

379
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:55,529
Riddler, it was more the Joker than it was the Riddler, but he still, it was good.

380
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:18,859
Get stuck in there. How did you even get out? The Arkham Riddler was the best one.

381
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:29,819
Yeah, that's pretty good. It was. We haven't got a TV or movie Riddler besides. I mean,

382
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:33,100
the one from Gotham. I haven't really watched Gotham though. Is that a good show?

383
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:49,300
Why am I not paying attention? I'm seeing a lot of conflicting opinions here. Of course not.

384
01:19:49,939 --> 01:19:57,609
Wasn't the penguin good on that show though? I heard that was the reason to watch the show

385
01:19:57,609 --> 01:20:16,460
because the penguin was really good. Oh, the wind. Yeah, I'm an idiot. Yeah. All right. If we

386
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:27,060
already got a really good penguin locked down, then we got to get him in a movie. Danny DeVito

387
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:32,819
was the best penguin. I mean, that's, that's not even up for debate though. Yeah, that's

388
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:43,159
But Danny DeVito, I don't know. How old is Danny DeVito now?

389
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,479
That movie is so awful, even though DeVito is great. Yeah.

390
01:20:56,949 --> 01:21:02,890
I don't remember much of that movie, but I, no, I can't say that. Michael Keaton,

391
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:08,220
Michael Keaton's in that movie. It's automatically a good movie. If you guys

392
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:26,010
didn't know, Michael Keaton's like my favorite actor. All right, I gotta hold on. These things

393
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:36,199
launching around. Have I seen Birdman? Yes, I have. It was fantastic. He was great as

394
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:47,529
Batman. He was great in Birdman. He was great in Spider-Man. All the other, all the man movies.

395
01:21:47,529 --> 01:22:06,439
He was great in Beetlejuice. God. Fuck. It's one of those scenarios where anytime there's a

396
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:12,279
Beetlejuice ever again, it's just going to be, uh, you're not Michael Keaton. I don't like this

397
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:16,760
movie. You're not Michael Keaton. No, like we can't, it's not going to work. And it is that it's not,

398
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:29,739
it's impossible. It has to be Michael Keaton. It can't be anybody else. It can't be. What is this

399
01:22:29,739 --> 01:22:35,829
one? The above deals double damage until it's lost. Um, okay. I gotta read. Wait, does that mean I

400
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:53,779
got double damage and the three balls? Yeah. Michael Keaton is great. Well, so what other actors

401
01:22:53,779 --> 01:23:12,260
do I really like? What's my superhero, uh, actor list? I think Michael Keaton, Tom Holland. Yeah,

402
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:20,060
but we'll, we'll see though. Tom Holland is awesome. Got a long career ahead of him. Ask

403
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:43,829
me in 15 years. Willem Dafoe, Jim Carrey. Yeah. Oh, Woody Harrelson. Yeah. Woody Harrelson's pretty

404
01:23:43,829 --> 01:24:18,380
good too. I was trying to sneak it in. It's all right. Cape Lanchette is awesome and almost

405
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:43,479
everything. Who else? Ooh, Ryan Gosling. Yeah, he's done, he's done some good work. He's done some

406
01:24:43,479 --> 01:25:02,739
good work. You're right. Die. Sorry. Fuck. I needed that. No, I didn't. Uh, you know who actually

407
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:11,220
tops that list besides Michael Keaton, uh, is probably Gene Wilder. Gene Wilder was

408
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:22,659
awesome in everything, in everything. The original Willy Wonka. Yeah. And way more on an

409
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:37,609
incredibly storied career. He was just so interesting. He was so funny and fun and

410
01:25:38,569 --> 01:25:41,930
everything he said was just, you carried weight. It was, it was, it was amazing.

411
01:25:42,729 --> 01:26:04,869
Gene Wilder influenced a lot of people that you watch now, including me. So you're here now.

412
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:19,750
Oh, fuck. Don't touch anything. God damn it. Why am I so stupid about that? I got to be

413
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:27,670
on my way. I want to know what this means. Somebody said, I feel like I'm at a family

414
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:32,550
get together. And then they said residence sleeper. Is it, wait, you mean this is as

415
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:41,449
boring as being at a family get together? What? Get, well, go get fucking Yahtzee or Uno. What

416
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:52,939
are you doing? Why is that my fault? Go open up Monopoly and play six rounds and then everybody

417
01:26:53,020 --> 01:27:08,250
has to leave. Speaking of Monopoly, do you guys, like we should play Monopoly. Do I have Uno?

418
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,850
I don't even, I don't remember how to play Uno, if I'm honest with you. I really don't know.

419
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:26,119
You're supposed to be the entertainer. Yeah, but I got, I got, I got, I got that by, yeah,

420
01:27:26,119 --> 01:27:32,380
but I'm like stuck here. I'm like in traffic right now. I'm in really relaxing traffic

421
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:44,619
and I'm, I'm all right. You have Uno. What do you mean I have? How do you know I have Uno?

422
01:27:48,659 --> 01:28:03,750
How do you know that? You have Uno. You have the box. I don't, it came with your Xbox.

423
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:08,789
It comes with your Xbox. I bought this Xbox third party guys. I don't have Uno.

424
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:27,619
The? What is this? You have, I don't have Uno. Why is me saying I don't have Uno as strange as me

425
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:34,140
saying when I turn the faucet, no water comes out. What are you talking about? You fucking turn your

426
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:43,739
faucet. What are you, what? Like, no, it's not as, what are you talking about? He doesn't have

427
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:58,979
water in his house. It's a meme. Oh, I'm getting memed on. Okay. Well, sometimes it's hard to tell.

428
01:28:59,699 --> 01:29:13,659
It's hard to tell. Everyone's saying it at the same time. I can't even hit that one.

429
01:29:13,659 --> 01:29:24,789
This is the end. I gotta play that too. I gotta play No More Heroes 2. I can play Rhythm, uh,

430
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:35,500
Rhythm Heaven. I'm gonna be doing both beautiful Joes. We're fully, we're fully packed. All right,

431
01:29:35,500 --> 01:30:00,729
boss battle. I gotta play God Hand. That's right. I got Tony Hawk's Underground. What else we got?

432
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:20,619
I got a whole list, guys. Shit. All right. Don't be an idiot. Uh, what else we got off hand?

433
01:30:20,619 --> 01:30:28,539
Oh, the Surge 2. Yeah, the Surge 2. But I'm probably only gonna, I'm probably only gonna

434
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:38,229
play that for like two hours. All the Lord of the Rings PlayStation 2 games. All of them. Um,

435
01:30:38,229 --> 01:30:59,539
holy shit, am I about to beat the game? Why are we here then? Because this is, uh, come on,

436
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:11,779
this is, this is unplanned scream. I have plans for everything else. All right, let's put a statue

437
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:28,100
up. Did I do, did I rebuild everything already? Wait, what about this house? You literally won't

438
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:34,869
get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it. All right, I wouldn't, all right, I'm gonna

439
01:31:34,869 --> 01:31:39,590
remember your name because when I get past level one in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking

440
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:50,199
scream your name. What was your name? It's fake what? I'm gonna write that name down. I'm gonna

441
01:31:50,199 --> 01:31:56,010
literally yell your name. I'm gonna yell your name when I get, when I'm done. Fake up. All right,

442
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:01,289
fake, fake rumble. You got it. All right. Yeah. I'm, when I am done with that, I'm screaming your

443
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:16,250
name. And I'm gonna turn the gain on my mic as high as it'll go. Oh, look at the farm. Oh,

444
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:23,619
this is cute. At least my daughter now has a decent place to live. We're at the end. This is

445
01:32:23,619 --> 01:32:33,699
the last level, I think. This, look at this cute little game. This is, wow. Seriously. Wow.

446
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:40,819
Ooh, can I do anything here? King of Gerudo is valiant. People never starved under his reign.

447
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:58,699
He disappears and makes everyone sad. Cool. Jump in there and get crushed. But I'm the psycho.

448
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:07,930
All right, let's rebuild the house. 9.99. Do it. You have a heart of gold. Please accept this reward.

449
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:19,939
You got an extra life. It's the mayor's house. I have enough money. What about you? I haven't

450
01:33:19,939 --> 01:33:23,699
talked to you the whole thing. I've heard that you can cast special magic spells if you press

451
01:33:23,699 --> 01:33:31,800
a magic button when the orb hits the magic wand. Yes, I can. All right, let's get it.

452
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:55,590
The cursed castle. Here we go. Yeah, I got all the Lord of the Rings games.

453
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:02,310
What else we got? We got all that shit too. Oh, I was gonna bring this up because,

454
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:09,369
uh, not what a dodge. Um, I was talking about cleaning games and this is like, you know,

455
01:34:09,369 --> 01:34:14,729
maybe three or four days ago when I last streamed before New Year's. And it was like, oh, you,

456
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:18,489
you would love Chibi-Robo. I'm like, all right, Chibi-Robo. Let's get it. That sounds like fun.

457
01:34:19,289 --> 01:34:27,930
This fucking game is $200. Is this like some extremely rare video game? It's like 200 fucking

458
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:38,390
bucks. Somebody just said, I have it. Um, well, you might be able to make like at least 180 dollars.

459
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:45,770
Time to sell it. Yeah. Yeah. All, yeah. All of you sell it. All of you sell it. Flood the market.

460
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:51,020
Flood the market. So it comes down to like fucking 80 bucks. So all of you sell. So all of you sell.

461
01:34:54,460 --> 01:35:04,789
All of you sell it. Somebody said they have two copies. Holy shit. You lose a life and it bounces

462
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:26,460
back up. This could get really bad. I just lost two lives in a row. Have I thought I'm playing

463
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:35,180
control? Yeah, but control sits kind of in that weird spot. Kind of a Jedi fallen order is.

464
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:43,699
It's something I want to do and want to play, but I, I just, I'm probably not gonna. And why is

465
01:35:43,699 --> 01:36:02,340
this happening? Maybe I, it's on, it's on the list. It is, but it would have to, it's kind of, okay.

466
01:36:04,869 --> 01:36:10,539
Just like Breath of the Wild. I still, I might play Breath of the Wild. I mean, I got, look,

467
01:36:10,539 --> 01:36:15,100
I have to come clean with you guys. I have to be completely realistic. I did put on the list of

468
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:23,239
games, the ones that I've bought. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games 2020. So how could I,

469
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:30,550
could I really play that without playing Breath of the Wild? I feel like that would be upsetting

470
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:57,739
to a lot of people. You're not going to get the lore of Breath of the Wild? Why not? But yeah,

471
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:02,699
also another game that I really, really want to play desperately. And this game is also

472
01:37:03,979 --> 01:37:15,829
$250 for the GameCube. It's called Gotcha Force. Anybody remember that one? Game was

473
01:37:15,909 --> 01:37:37,619
ridiculous. It was so much fun. Mario Sunshine is also on that list. What the fuck is this?

474
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:52,979
10,000 for the crown? Jesus. I'm, I'm not getting the crown. It's not going to happen.

475
01:37:59,779 --> 01:38:10,409
I, I got distracted. So when you have this shit out, I feel the same way about multi-ball and

476
01:38:10,409 --> 01:38:23,100
pinball. And so it's like, you need to have two eyes go in two different directions. Omega lol

477
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:37,939
bits. Wait, what? Hold on. Bilater just gave $250 in bits. 25,000 bits. Buy Gotcha Force,

478
01:38:37,939 --> 01:38:45,579
you sweaty streamer fuck. I'm, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy Gotcha Force. So I'm

479
01:38:45,579 --> 01:38:49,100
going to buy it and I'm going to own it. And then I'm going to be the guy that owns Gotcha Force.

480
01:38:50,140 --> 01:39:00,890
I'll be one of like five people on earth and then I will lock it away. It's going to be an

481
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:11,529
asset that I hold for the rest of my life. Uh, but if I like to, Jesus, that's insane amount of

482
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:20,100
money again. Let's be clear. Again. Thanks a lot, dude. Seriously. Buy it now, you fucking liar.

483
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:47,590
I'm gonna, I'm gonna buy it. Jesus. Damn it. He's going to use, he's going to use it on pizza

484
01:39:47,590 --> 01:40:00,729
instead. I'm going to buy a $250 pizza. I'm going to get a special ordered 600 foot wide pizza.

485
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:07,079
Make it, make it, make it real soupy this time too. Make it real soupy.

486
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:24,119
Yeah, make, make, make, make me an old fashioned, old fashioned way. I can't, I can't see. I can't,

487
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:30,199
I can't, I can't see. He can't see. I can't see. Why am I quoting It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World?

488
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:46,920
What the fuck is going on? That's a movie from like the fucking fifties. Have I quoted it before?

489
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:57,800
I, I, wait, hold on. I've quoted It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World before. When? I do it all the time?

490
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:17,289
Do I actually do this? It's under the big W. It was Smiley Grogan and the great tuna factory robbery.

491
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:32,890
Yeah, I used to watch the movie all the time when I was younger. In fact, when I was younger,

492
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:40,489
we had that movie recorded on a blank VHS tape, but the movie is so long that we never got to

493
01:41:40,489 --> 01:41:46,170
see as kids the end of the movie because it was like 90 minutes for a VHS tape or something,

494
01:41:46,329 --> 01:41:50,890
60 minutes. And we would always get to the apex of the entire movie and we never got to see it

495
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:56,729
because we didn't have the second part recorded. So we just watched the first like hour and 12

496
01:41:56,729 --> 01:42:07,449
minutes of whatever it was. My parents used to just describe, oh, and by the way, this is what

497
01:42:07,449 --> 01:42:21,859
happens at the end and blah, blah, blah. Oh yeah, okay, that's funny. I'll give, I'll give you a

498
01:42:21,859 --> 01:42:34,789
dollar. Um, three dollars, three dollars. I'm remembering the whole movie. Ray, we're gonna

499
01:42:34,869 --> 01:42:41,420
have to kill him at the gas station where Jonathan Winters is like freaking the fuck out and like

500
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:51,880
beating the shit out of those two guys. Okay. Has that movie influenced more in my life than

501
01:42:51,880 --> 01:43:07,720
I give it credit for? Probably. I don't know. I mean, that was one of like six VHS tapes that I

502
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:15,640
had. So when I was, I don't know, 12, 10, nine, 10, 11, 12, I probably watched the first hour

503
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:38,739
and 10 minutes of that movie 150 times. Listen to your father. He's holding the two phones up

504
01:43:38,739 --> 01:43:44,420
and the mother is like yelling at the daughter. He's holding the, he's on two different phones

505
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:49,699
and he's talking to his daughter and his mother and he holds the phones up together

506
01:43:49,699 --> 01:43:55,449
so they can talk to each other. I gotta watch this movie again. That movie's fucking crazy.

507
01:44:03,859 --> 01:44:06,340
On stream. That movie's not public domain. No way it is.

508
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:21,340
Mama, I'm coming. Mama, I'm coming to save you. It's, it's all coming back to me. It really is.

509
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:37,930
Now that's what we call walking in there. I still, I can't afford that.

510
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:49,579
There's that one scene where the two, where the two guys are fighting outside in like the sand,

511
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:55,180
like the desert area and they do, they do the classic, I think they like came up with it maybe.

512
01:44:55,180 --> 01:45:01,180
I don't know but they did, they both throw a punch at each other and they, they connect with

513
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:09,159
their fists in the air and they get hurt. It's like fucking funny. They throw a punch at the

514
01:45:09,159 --> 01:45:26,600
exact same time and they fucking smash fists together. That's hilarious, boomer. Hey, some of

515
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:42,500
it, come on. It's, it's, it's a, it's a comedy movie. It seriously has some great stunts in it.

516
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:54,569
Yeah, it really was. It really was like, I don't remember. All right, we're gonna get in that right

517
01:45:54,569 --> 01:46:02,020
side and then we don't. It's over. What movie? The movie's called It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

518
01:46:02,899 --> 01:46:18,329
It's the actual title of the movie. It's public domain? No, it's not. It's public domain? Am I,

519
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:37,369
am I, wait, am I finally gonna get to see the end of this movie? Yeah, I still want to do that.

520
01:46:37,369 --> 01:46:46,420
Watch public domain movies. In fact, I want to show you guys a skill called we're gonna watch

521
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:51,300
a bunch of public domain movies and we're gonna do what I do when I watch regular movies sometimes

522
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:56,340
on Netflix. And that's the, you'll get the gist of the entire movie. You watch for two minutes

523
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:01,859
and then you skip 20, watch for three minutes, skip 30 minutes, watch for five minutes, skip 10

524
01:47:01,859 --> 01:47:29,750
minutes. Why would you do that? What do you mean why would I do that? I, some, guys, there are a

525
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:54,390
lot of movies that aren't very good and I just want to get the gist of them. You're a psycho,

526
01:47:54,390 --> 01:48:02,760
what? And watch movies that are good. Yeah, but I sometimes, what's the last one I did it with?

527
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:16,810
I did it with Dad's Home 2? The one with John Cena and, no, yeah, the one with John, no. Will

528
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:23,989
Farrell? Will Farrell and, you've heard this before, yeah, it's the last, I'm telling you,

529
01:48:23,989 --> 01:48:35,460
that's the last time I did it. Yeah, Mark Wahlberg, Will Farrell, yeah, I've seen that whole

530
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:40,550
movie. I just have to skip like 20 minutes every five minutes. You'd be surprised how many movies

531
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:51,939
you can watch and understand everything that's happening when you do this role. Can you just

532
01:48:51,939 --> 01:49:22,180
get in there, please? Come here. Just read the Wikipedia. No, that's, that's way worse. Yeah,

533
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:27,210
at least I get to see some of the scenes in the movie and I only do this with movies that are

534
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:39,079
not good. Because I'm not going to do this with The Godfather. I think, like, the Sherlock Holmes

535
01:49:39,079 --> 01:49:43,319
Will Farrell movie is not a movie I want to spend two fucking hours watching, so I'll watch it for

536
01:49:43,319 --> 01:50:04,729
12 minutes. Plus, it means I can reference scenes so people think, you know, think I actually watched

537
01:50:04,729 --> 01:50:11,500
the whole movie. I can reference specific quotes from the movie that I would, I, I wouldn't know

538
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:19,300
unless I saw it otherwise. So now at the office I can be like, remember that scene with the bees?

539
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:27,960
Hey, remember that scene in Dad and Daddy's Home 2 with the thermostat? They all freak out

540
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:30,760
and then they're like, who's changing the thermostat? And John Lithgow comes down,

541
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:54,899
it's like, it's not billions of degrees in here. See, it's not hard. All right, I, I don't want to

542
01:50:54,899 --> 01:51:22,119
die here. This is like the last level. Clean it up. Clean it up. One, two. I could play Bubble

543
01:51:22,119 --> 01:51:33,350
Bobble too. That's a classic game. And no, not, not Bust-A-Move. Not, ready, go! No, I'm talking

544
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:38,890
about the original Bubble Bobble. They really threw those two dragons on the bus, by the way.

545
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:42,729
Because like, where's, where's Bubble Bobble? Like, where's the other, where's the actual

546
01:51:42,729 --> 01:52:00,970
Bubble Bobble game sequel? Bust-A-Move is better? That's, I don't think so. I don't think that's

547
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:10,279
correct. They took those two dragons and turned them into an iPad game. And have they even appeared

548
01:52:10,279 --> 01:52:17,659
anywhere else ever? They were, they were really iconic characters. What happened to them? What

549
01:52:17,739 --> 01:52:37,000
happened to those two dragons? They're public domain now. All right. But really, who owns those

550
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:49,500
characters? Are those Namco characters? No, Konami? Who owns the two dragons? Taiko? Taito? Okay.

551
01:52:50,220 --> 01:52:57,960
What is, what has Taito done recently? Anything? Or did they get liquidated somewhere?

552
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:16,279
Nothing. They're under Square Enix now. Oh, okay. I'd love to see a new Bubble Bobble-inspired

553
01:53:16,279 --> 01:53:40,409
video game with those two dragons. And I'm going to lose this game. Get in there. Finally. Get in

554
01:53:40,409 --> 01:53:47,699
there. This was always the worst new plate breakout when you ended up with one that you needed to get

555
01:53:47,699 --> 01:54:16,760
and it was just, you couldn't do it no matter what you did. Oh jeez. Square Enix owns it? No.

556
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:31,770
Now picturing the Bubble Bobble RPG. It'd probably be pretty fun. What are the characters that did,

557
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:37,210
because Taito was around right from the very beginning of the NES. They probably have a bunch

558
01:54:37,210 --> 01:54:42,090
of characters. Are they, are they Snake, Rattle, and Roll? Is it Snake, Rattle, and Roll, they

559
01:54:42,090 --> 01:55:11,460
Taito? Who owns Snake, Rattle, and Roll? Rare does? Why, what the hell are they doing? How have they

560
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:21,989
not done Snake, Rattle, and Roll too? I feel so bad for Rare because I really feel like they're

561
01:55:21,989 --> 01:55:35,210
just like frozen in cryostasis. Like they have Rare frozen in cryostasis so Microsoft gets to

562
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:38,489
walk into the museum where they are and just look at them every once in a while and it'd be like

563
01:55:38,649 --> 01:55:44,489
have a big cigar in their mouth being like, that's right, I remember, I remember Banjo-Kazooie.

564
01:55:45,529 --> 01:55:49,050
Nobody else does. And then close the fucking door and lock it.

565
01:55:51,909 --> 01:55:57,750
Spoilers for Star Wars, but who cares? Um, no, people, do people care about like the ones from

566
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:26,359
the 70s? Probably. Who gives a fuck? Oh no, that's right, that's not, it doesn't matter. I've already

567
01:56:26,359 --> 01:56:33,289
talked about it on stream because I've already shown it on stream. You can't stop but now the

568
01:56:33,289 --> 01:56:58,920
carbonite is gone. Yep, all right, that's true. How much money do you think that Raiden Solo makes

569
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:22,970
because that song exists? What do you think? It's probably a lot. Get in there. Wait, why is this

570
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:30,899
locked? Don't waste all your gold. Actually, I can, ready? This is gonna be a big moment for me.

571
01:57:30,899 --> 01:57:38,380
No, it's not. I just like shook. I need more magic. I fucked it up. It's in Just Dance too.

572
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:53,560
Give me more magic. I could have done a huge line here. Do they still make Just Dance games? Yes,

573
01:57:53,560 --> 01:58:00,840
yeah, they do. In fact, I think, I think they still release for the Wii. Original Wii, not Wii U.

574
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:28,819
It's accurate? Yep. Pepsi. The Wii is still going pretty strong from my understanding.

575
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:39,289
And the game cube. I love those little discs. Little game cube discs. Oh, they're so cool.

576
01:58:46,329 --> 01:59:00,789
They're so cool. I can't wait to spend $500 on two discs. Door. Oh, door, door, door, yeah.

577
01:59:00,789 --> 01:59:10,460
Come on, get in there. Don't. I can't. Ah, guys, it's hard to get in there.

578
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:46,979
Chibi-Robo. Look at this room. It's all treasure chests. Guys. Ooh, this is a fun game. This is a

579
01:59:46,979 --> 01:59:50,979
cute little game. All right. Let me tell you. You can tell when a game is good. Guys, I've spilt

580
01:59:50,979 --> 02:00:16,039
coffee on me that were more expensive than this. So come on. You. Time for the final boss. What

581
02:00:16,039 --> 02:00:27,420
kind of coffee is that expensive? A, a Trenta iced Frappuccino with extra sugar, double milk,

582
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:54,020
double cream, 10 pumps of French vanilla. The drink is like $11. No, I don't owe to that.

583
02:00:54,659 --> 02:01:36,460
Oh, what do I do? I do the thing. It's going fast. Things going fast. How big is the Trenta?

584
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:42,619
Anybody know? How many ounces? And how big is the super size that they like made it legal?

585
02:01:45,109 --> 02:02:04,789
30 ounces. What's the super size? Super size is 80. Wait, a super size from McDonald's was 80

586
02:02:04,789 --> 02:02:20,779
ounces? No. Holy shit. Wait, how many ounces is in a two liter? Was a super size as big as a two

587
02:02:20,859 --> 02:02:43,989
liter? No magic allowed in the final boss. It's an instant kill. Only four lives left.

588
02:02:44,869 --> 02:02:46,630
This could go to shit really quickly actually.

589
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:58,069
80 ounces is like three liters. I kind of want to look this up.

590
02:03:00,039 --> 02:03:10,630
What's the, um, the biggest purchasable large drink? Big gulp from seven up.

591
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:18,630
Super size from McDonald's. Which one? What was it? Oh, fuck. There's another one. The nether world.

592
02:03:30,619 --> 02:03:45,989
Wait, there's another one to build? Oh look, there it is. Is that me? There we go. All right,

593
02:03:45,989 --> 02:03:56,979
this is the mayor's house. All right, so what do I talk to now? The four sacred children have the

594
02:03:56,979 --> 02:04:00,340
power of summoning the forces of nature. They could help us if we could find them. I got them.

595
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:08,550
Have I ever heard of Fury? I've played Fury on stream. I think I got like halfway through it.

596
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:14,100
And then like a lot of games I've ever played on this channel years ago I sort of gave up on.

597
02:04:15,130 --> 02:04:21,210
Yeah, I did. Like four years ago or something. Okay, this looks ridiculous.

598
02:04:26,579 --> 02:04:35,430
We're in the nether. Go back? Go back to the map. I forgot about somebody?

599
02:04:37,029 --> 02:04:57,180
There are only four lives left. Oh, my house is a real palace and now it's gone. Donate one

600
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:06,649
GP. Ha ha, gotcha. I've never had a house, but thanks. Today's a great day for Tarot.

601
02:05:06,649 --> 02:05:11,130
Thanks to you this town will flourish once again. Again, once evil is vanquished. By the way,

602
02:05:11,130 --> 02:05:20,760
we found this amulet piece in the debris. You got the fire amulet piece. What does that do?

603
02:05:21,319 --> 02:05:37,460
All right, let's go. Oh, buy. I could buy. I'm even gonna buy stuff. I'm gonna buy hearts.

604
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:48,760
Oh, here we go. Here's the biggest big gulps. The original fountain drink from McDonald's was

605
02:05:48,760 --> 02:06:00,380
seven ounces. All right, hold on. Let's see. Let's get this on stream. I want to look at this.

606
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:11,449
So, the biggest of big gulps. Kid-sized McDonald's in 2012 was 12 ounces.

607
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:22,710
Super-sized from McDonald's was 42 ounces. That's it? Great biggie from Wendy's,

608
02:06:22,710 --> 02:06:35,260
the king size. They were all the same. The KFC mega jug? What is the KFC mega jug? The beast?

609
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:48,920
What is ARCO? I've never heard of ARCO. Like a gas station? The humongous come and go.

610
02:06:49,960 --> 02:07:04,119
100. What the fuck? I feel like that's, is that a made up name? Is this real? No, it's a,

611
02:07:04,119 --> 02:07:09,350
come and go is a convenience store. Okay. Well, why is it, why is it spelled like that? It's like,

612
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:18,890
kind of like humongous. Oh, okay. 100. Fuck it. The team gulp from 7-Eleven was 128 ounces.

613
02:07:19,850 --> 02:07:30,229
What's the team gulp? This is just the thing that they dump on the coach

614
02:07:30,789 --> 02:07:44,949
when people win the football game. Team gulp. Why would somebody order this? This is,

615
02:07:44,949 --> 02:07:51,619
this is just a trash barrel with, you know, this is gross. This is just like a weird trash

616
02:07:51,619 --> 02:08:15,670
barrel full of liquid. This is a gallon. Gross. Look at that thing. That's like the, that's the

617
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:22,180
thing that has fucking fertilizer in it in your garage. You don't want to drink out of that.

618
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:44,409
Propane tank? Yeah. Jesus. What is this? Is it a germ of gulp? This is, this is a coffee.

619
02:08:52,949 --> 02:09:10,859
I hate this picture. No, I don't, I don't even want this on camera.

620
02:09:11,659 --> 02:09:16,220
I don't want that on camera. That looks just, I don't like it. I do not like that picture.

621
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:24,060
I don't like it. I'm not leaving it. Oh wait, I was going to buy stuff here.

622
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:46,100
Let's refill all our magic. Let's get a bunch of health. Hey, one life. Oh, I'll do it to 10.

623
02:09:46,739 --> 02:10:00,579
I think that's enough. 12. All right, I guess I need a thousand. Let's go. We want it back. We

624
02:10:00,579 --> 02:10:09,579
want coffee mug back. No, it's just, I don't, that looks like a good cup of coffee though.

625
02:10:09,579 --> 02:10:15,859
I love coffee. There's two things that are certain in life for me. That's pizza and coffee.

626
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:36,060
Both of them. Can I kill these things? Oh, they block. You fuckers.

627
02:10:39,979 --> 02:10:58,310
Got him from behind. Oh shit. This is bad. Can you let us hear your BPM? Beats per minute,

628
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:02,899
like my heart. How would I even, how would you guys even be able to hear that?

629
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:13,239
Put the microphone off to my chest and mute everything and make everything really,

630
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:30,979
really quiet. I'm not even sure you still hear it. Get up there. Get up there. Try it. I feel

631
02:11:30,979 --> 02:11:38,380
like a lot of people will leave if I do that. That's, I mean, I don't think people would want

632
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:52,010
to hear that. Can you imagine if I put my chest up here and it's like, like, holy fuck me. Jeremy,

633
02:11:52,010 --> 02:12:13,050
go to the doctor. It's like, that's not normal. I got it in the mouth. Oh boy. Really could use

634
02:12:14,010 --> 02:12:40,779
this right now. Damn it. I don't have any more. There it is. I don't want to die. This

635
02:12:40,779 --> 02:12:51,619
reminds me of a cake. Yeah. It's kind of, it's kind of cakey. It's like a cake. Oh,

636
02:12:51,619 --> 02:12:55,699
I forgot to show you guys. I got the, I got something cool. I got something cool.

637
02:12:57,460 --> 02:13:18,920
Not like I forgot to show you guys. Oh yeah. I'll show you. This is tough. I don't want to lose

638
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:29,899
this. There's a lot of opportunity for me to lose and I don't want it right now. Not this. No, no.

639
02:13:37,850 --> 02:13:47,609
Oh yes. This is a bonus room. I don't know. I'll show you after. Well, before I turn the stream

640
02:13:47,609 --> 02:13:56,020
off, I'll show you. What level is this one? All right. I'm going to sneak it up underneath.

641
02:13:56,020 --> 02:14:14,520
No, there we go. It's stuck. Get stuck. Get stuck. Get stuck. Get in there. Get stuck. Show us. I

642
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:20,939
got, you mentioned the cake thing. Oh, that instantly kills me. I just lost two lives.

643
02:14:21,819 --> 02:14:37,800
Oh, I got, I got a great portrait of cake Mario. It's going up. I'm going to hang on to magic.

644
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:43,779
In fact, I actually may. Is it cake Mario though? I get a further inspection. I'll look at it in a

645
02:14:43,779 --> 02:15:06,260
minute. I think it's cake. Yeah, it's cake Mario. Chat doesn't know. A lot of new viewers. Oh,

646
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:33,340
whatever. It's just cake Mario. All right. This guy's got to die. Get it. Get it. Die. What?

647
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:50,090
That hit him right in the back. How did I, how did I let it? I was going to say I ain't

648
02:15:50,090 --> 02:16:14,390
fucking around anymore. Have I played Noita? Nope. I have not. Jesus. Oh, all right. Nine lives.

649
02:16:21,449 --> 02:16:37,700
Play it right now. I'm about to beat this breakout game. You say Noita? How do you say it?

650
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:59,879
Noita? Noita? Noita? Shit. That was bad. All right. There can't be many more levels after this.

651
02:16:59,879 --> 02:17:04,280
Hopefully I don't blow it. He's not going to ever, he's never going to play Noita.

652
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:17,510
Um, I don't know. We got a lot of stuff to do and I also have seven streams that are not video games.

653
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:39,590
That might be fun. That's right. You heard that right. Seven. Seven. Did you give up on FTK? No,

654
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:44,790
actually. I have a meeting with the people that made it because now I believe it is pretty close

655
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:51,989
to being really truly ready and that test that we did a few weeks back was very, very, very, very

656
02:17:51,989 --> 02:18:01,319
helpful. Uh, yeah, I have like a meeting with those guys on, um, I think on Monday. You'll

657
02:18:01,319 --> 02:18:16,409
hear more about that soon. They all unlock the puzzle card game. Oh, this is it. Oh man, that's

658
02:18:16,409 --> 02:18:48,620
fast. I have five health? Oh, break the, I could break the cage. It's like playing air hockey. Get

659
02:18:48,620 --> 02:19:36,840
up there. That's how you, that's the way you do it. Damn it. One more. Oh, oh, success losing against

660
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:45,829
CPU paddle. I'm fine. I got it. Damn, I got late, didn't it? Did I win? You saved the sacred child

661
02:19:45,829 --> 02:19:59,850
of fire. Thank you. Save the remaining children and they will grant you with their power. That was

662
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:25,510
one. Wait, what? Talk to her in the town. Oh, demons could have used our magic to open a breach

663
02:20:25,510 --> 02:20:46,940
to the nether world. That's one fourth of the game. Is it though? Where's the other, where the other

664
02:20:46,940 --> 02:20:58,200
children? Are they hidden? They might be hidden in another level. I'm telling you, simple living is

665
02:20:58,200 --> 02:21:12,040
the best lifestyle. He doesn't know. Go back to the nether world. Wait, what?

666
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:29,750
Oh, the 60 levels across the five worlds. Wait, so I have to find the way to get in.

667
02:21:30,870 --> 02:21:53,510
Wait, didn't I go in this thing's mouth? I'm confused. Clear this level. Yeah, I'm going to

668
02:21:53,510 --> 02:22:05,379
clear this level. Fuck, there's only five lives too. Shit, I'm in trouble. I should have bought

669
02:22:05,379 --> 02:22:31,620
lives. That was a mistake. How the fuck did I miss all those? I'm so sad. Come on. But yeah, after

670
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:39,610
tomorrow. I'm not sure what we're doing after that. There's a ton of things on this list.

671
02:22:40,329 --> 02:22:49,770
We'll just pick one. Got a lot of things to stream. All right, I don't want to get accidentally put

672
02:22:49,770 --> 02:23:01,780
in there. Katana Zero. I'm going to play Katana Zero. Maybe that's what we'll do after playing

673
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:11,850
Keep Talking Nobody Explodes. Possible. Next day or the day after, whatever. It's on the list.

674
02:23:12,729 --> 02:23:32,459
I would show you the list, but I don't want to spoil everything. Dude, I forgot that I played

675
02:23:32,459 --> 02:23:41,290
that police game. That game was weird. I completely forgot about that game. That was like

676
02:23:41,290 --> 02:24:13,770
yesterday in my brain. There it is. Is Pikmin on that list? It is not. It is not. Shit, it's not.

677
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:38,819
Yeah, it's not. Sorry. I just didn't put it on the list. Put it on. But which one? Pikmin 1,

678
02:24:38,819 --> 02:24:43,379
Pikmin 2, Pikmin 3. Which one is the one that people think is good? They are all good.

679
02:24:44,659 --> 02:25:01,700
1 and 2. Get them all. Mario Sunshine is on that list, though, so people can be happy about that

680
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:24,170
one. Just go in order. We could. How long are they? Are they long game? Not really. All right,

681
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:57,850
gotta be all blue. Or all whatever. All yellow. All red. All blue. All yellow. Oh my god. Yellow.

682
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:37,209
Yellow. I'm gonna beat the level before this happens. Blue. Red. Yellow. Red. All right. No.

683
02:26:38,680 --> 02:26:59,430
Red. Red. Oh my god. This is fucking ridiculous. Finally. It was just for one heart.

684
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:17,780
There could be a crown in there. Have we still? All right, I get it. So you have to get them all

685
02:27:17,780 --> 02:27:26,250
through different... All right. All of them are in here. Are we gonna get them all? I don't know.

686
02:27:26,250 --> 02:27:35,540
I don't know if we're gonna get them all. Well, we're going up here. Oh, this will be interesting.

687
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:53,799
Three orbs. Double power. And catch them all. Let's go. It's just a shotgun that I get to catch.

688
02:27:55,430 --> 02:28:01,430
Fuck! What? How? How? I'm done playing again. That just made me so sad. Like, that actually

689
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:08,840
made me so sad. I can't believe it. That's... I'm... That's actually ridiculous. I can't believe I

690
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:34,040
fucked that up. Is this gonna go down? I'm so... What the fuck? All right. I'm in trouble. If I die,

691
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:40,440
I'm a... If I die, it was a cute game. This is a really cute game. I'm done with it if it's cute.

692
02:28:41,159 --> 02:28:47,879
If it's... If it's a cute game, I'm done with it. It wants... All right. I'm... Okay. I actually am

693
02:28:47,879 --> 02:28:53,450
like fucking starting to freak out. I just want... I just want a pizza. No. All right. I'm not gonna

694
02:28:53,450 --> 02:28:58,729
be able to... Who cares? It's... This heart's in here. Don't even get the chest. What is going on

695
02:28:58,729 --> 02:29:05,209
right now, guys? What's going on? What am I doing? I just... I'm like throwing. I'm not even trying

696
02:29:05,209 --> 02:29:48,180
to throw. I swear to God. Motherfucker. Yellow. All right. Bart. Bart. Bart. Your mind says game,

697
02:29:48,180 --> 02:30:02,920
but your heart says pizza. Or like maybe like tacos or something. A good... A good nice like

698
02:30:03,559 --> 02:30:08,360
soft shell, you know what I mean? Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking

699
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:32,139
about. Get up there. All right. Pull together here, seriously. Before I lose... Well, I got one child,

700
02:30:32,139 --> 02:30:41,129
right? So that's all right. Look, I need to get the four children of power. All right. Well,

701
02:30:41,129 --> 02:30:46,090
with this, I'll be able to at least turn on... Our TV's at least will work, right?

702
02:31:07,219 --> 02:31:29,420
His brain is mush. Oh my God. I was looking at chat. All right. Yeah. All right. Okay. There it is.

703
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:36,219
All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Yep. This game's actually really fun, though.

704
02:31:36,860 --> 02:31:55,049
I like this game. He's done? No, I'm... Not yet. I'll get to one more boss. He said the same thing

705
02:31:55,049 --> 02:32:02,409
about Jump King. Yeah, but Jump King was... So you guys don't know this, but like two days ago,

706
02:32:02,409 --> 02:32:09,850
I had this extreme urge to play the DLC. I was like, I want to play Jump King DLC right now.

707
02:32:10,649 --> 02:32:16,280
And then I stopped myself. I don't want to do that. That does not sound like a good idea.

708
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:37,290
All right. This is it. No losing here. Get it up top. Nice. Good. Again. Good. Good. Good. Good.

709
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:45,620
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. That's just exactly what I wanted to have happen.

710
02:32:50,459 --> 02:33:03,850
So there are two Jump King DLCs. I'm dead. No, we're good. We're good. I can do it again.

711
02:33:04,489 --> 02:33:26,950
The second one on average is between 25 and 40 hours. Yeah, I know. I've seen a lot of the clips

712
02:33:27,909 --> 02:33:36,250
of streamers and bawling. And I'm just like, that's probably going to be me. And

713
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:47,319
it's just like, damn, that's a lot. Some of these people handle that shit way better than I would.

714
02:34:00,809 --> 02:34:19,290
Seriously. It takes an average of like 20 to 40 hours. Maybe. We'll see. I really know what's

715
02:34:19,290 --> 02:34:24,360
going to happen. I said this to myself. I'm going to open it. I'm going to be really into it. Yeah,

716
02:34:24,360 --> 02:34:28,870
let's go into the DLC. I'm going to get into it. I'm going to beat it. And after like two or three

717
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:33,270
hours, I'm going to be sitting there and you guys won't even hear about this. It'll be me internally

718
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:40,229
saying to myself, not out loud, just going fucking mistake. This was, I could have fucking played

719
02:34:40,229 --> 02:34:44,229
Nancy Drew or anything. I could have played fucking no more heroes or something, but now I'm here.

720
02:34:45,819 --> 02:35:03,510
Fucking idiot. Stupid fucking goddamn idiot. And now I can't leave. I will be internalizing that.

721
02:35:11,719 --> 02:35:26,819
Get him. How is it not getting him? Jump in real life instead.

722
02:35:28,059 --> 02:35:42,040
That would be interesting, wouldn't it? Play this game if you're a streamer or a YouTuber.

723
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:51,659
I'm just happy that I beat it. And I, look, if I never beat it again, if I never do anything,

724
02:35:51,659 --> 02:36:00,100
but I did the base game and I'm like, okay. But if you start the DLC, you are accepting

725
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:09,930
the fact that you have to try to finish it. You don't start the Jump King DLC and go, man,

726
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:15,770
all right, it's the Jump King DLC. It's been an hour. No, I'm out. I'm not doing that. It's like,

727
02:36:15,770 --> 02:36:29,819
you've no, you have to get, you have to stay there. You did it. You did that. Oh, I didn't.

728
02:36:29,819 --> 02:36:57,500
When did I do that? Oh, you tried out both DLC. Yeah. But that was before even one of those times

729
02:36:57,500 --> 02:37:01,180
is I just stumbled upon it accidentally. I thought it was another area in the game. I didn't know it

730
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:08,340
was a DLC. Yeah, of course. But I wanted to see what it looked like. I didn't start playing the

731
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:30,979
DLC. I just wanted to see what it looked like. Oh, you started it. I didn't even start it.

732
02:37:39,659 --> 02:37:47,500
I did. Yeah, I did one screen. I'm playing a game that's relaxing. That's not Jump King.

733
02:37:55,850 --> 02:38:02,729
The stream has been kind of interesting. This was like, I was that that emergency game was

734
02:38:02,729 --> 02:38:16,549
crazy. And now I'm just like mouth open. It's pretty rare. We don't want you to relax. We

735
02:38:16,549 --> 02:38:26,090
want you to play Jump King. Don't relax. Stop relaxing. Fine. Fine. I'll open it.

736
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:41,959
I'm not going to beat it. I'm going to. No, no, don't let them get to you. Don't let them feed on your

737
02:38:43,159 --> 02:38:59,049
vices and your insecurities. Don't let them. I don't want to open it. I'm not going to beat it

738
02:38:59,049 --> 02:39:06,600
tonight. I've been streaming for six hours. I'm not going to beat Jump King DLC tonight.

739
02:39:07,159 --> 02:39:12,940
You guys just told me it takes like 50 hours to beat this thing. I'm not going to beat it now.

740
02:39:14,139 --> 02:39:30,020
Me and Joel are planning to keep talking. Nobody explodes tomorrow. I'm going to play it right now.
