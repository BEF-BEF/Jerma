1
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:11,109
Hey. Hey, friend. How you doing? What's going on? Give me... I'm just catching my breath. I just ran.

2
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:15,589
You guys have no idea what it's like behind the scenes. There's a lot of running. There's a lot of

3
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:21,190
running. There's a lot of... of... of... of... My drink is not ready. There's not enough ice in it.

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:29,260
It's crazy behind the scenes here. There's not enough ice in my drink. Shit's crazy here.

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:44,469
Anyways, how you doing? Jeremy, we're always on time. Not me. Let me make a tweet. We'll talk about

6
00:00:44,469 --> 00:01:29,930
a bunch of stuff. Just give me a minute. BRB. Okay. Do you guys know what I'm talking about

7
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:37,609
when I say that? When you realize that you put ice in your drink and you look over at it,

8
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:45,480
there's three or four little pea-sized ice cubes and it just ruins the rest of your entire day.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,519
It's like that and then you take a sip out of it and this shit's lukewarm. It's not even cold.

10
00:01:51,079 --> 00:02:04,200
You almost get annoyed that you want to just fish those out because they're not doing anything.

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,789
I know. I'm just fucking around. Play papers, please. I've already played papers, please.

12
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:23,669
Are you guys like me? If you're like me, a drink... Correct me here if you need to.

13
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:37,909
A drink needs to be either very hot or very cold. Unless it's water. If we're talking about a glass

14
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:42,789
of water, that can be room temp. That's fine. Anything else that's not water, that shit better

15
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:53,539
be ice cold or piping hot. Yeah, room temperature water is the way that I like to drink water.

16
00:02:53,539 --> 00:03:00,389
If you're not talking about what... Nobody wants to drink a lukewarm fruit punch.

17
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:11,639
Nobody wants to drink a barely kind of not really even room temp coffee or tea. No. Ice coffee? Yep.

18
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:26,389
Hot coffee? Yep. Cold fruit punch? Yep. Hot fruit punch? No. Lukewarm fruit punch? Absolutely not.

19
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:37,219
I would rather drink a hot fruit punch than a lukewarm room temperature one. Does that make me

20
00:03:37,219 --> 00:04:02,710
weird? Does it? Okay. Well, whatever. Today, we were going to play... We were going to do DreadX today,

21
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,039
but like all things on this channel and all streams you've seen on this channel,

22
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,729
last second I pivoted to something else 25 minutes ago. And instead of doing that,

23
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,029
we're going to do that tomorrow, we're going to do something interesting.

24
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:32,170
No, I'm not going to play the Quarry. Guys, so many people have streamed that game that you

25
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:42,730
probably have memorized the entire script. I would be in the game and I would look over here and you

26
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:58,300
would just be writing dialogue as it was happening. I didn't play the last one either. I don't know.

27
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:07,290
I'd rather do DreadX than the Quarry. I have my resident sleepers on standby.

28
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,399
Well, you better put those away because what we're actually doing...

29
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:23,209
There is an event going on on Steam right now. It is the Steam Demo Day week. And what that means

30
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:30,310
is there are thousands, I think, or hundreds of demos on Steam. And I've got it open here.

31
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,220
And I'm going to scroll through and we're going to pick a random shit to play. And I'm going to

32
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:45,480
give you my real... I'm going to give you my real opinions on a scale of one to five. Five being the

33
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:53,899
best. One being decent. Kind of decent. We're not trying to discourage anybody here, okay?

34
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:22,139
One being decent. Five being great. There is... No, there is no scale. Why would I even rate them?

35
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:28,759
I'm not going to rate them. I just think it's a fun idea. We want click maps. We want click maps.

36
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,399
No, you're not getting click maps. It takes too long. I'll give you my honest... I'm not going

37
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,100
to give them a score of one through five. I'm going to give you my honest opinions of what I

38
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,720
thought about the demo, okay? Oh, there are a thousand of these. So we kind of have to go.

39
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,600
We're going to get started. I'm just going to pick out ones that I think look interesting.

40
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,980
I'm going to install them. We're going to go. I'm already seeing some pretty interesting looking

41
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:11,980
ones. Are you guys ready? How do you feel? You feel good? You feel good? Can I just test my noise

42
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:26,730
limiter here? It's not sound fine? Yeah, whatever. Okay. Some of these look good. Are these games

43
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,370
even out? No, they're coming soon. These games aren't even released yet, but there's demos for

44
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:39,420
them. This is kind of cool. What the hell's going on here? I'm actually... This is really cool. All

45
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:48,740
right, here we go. So as you see here... Hi, how are you? As you see here, we have quite the list

46
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:55,779
of games here. Each one of these has a demo, and I'm literally just going to scroll through and see

47
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,259
if one pops out that I think looks cool. I already got one I think that looks cool already. What's

48
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:07,560
this one? This one's a roguelike? What do you guys think? We're not going to start at one. There are

49
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,720
a thousand demos. We're not starting at one. I look like a fucking caveman today. I sometimes

50
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:25,000
look over here, and I catch what I look like on the preview, man. This one? This one looks kind

51
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,279
of cool. All right, I'm going to do this one. Wait, I can buy this? I thought it was not out.

52
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,799
Oh, pre-purchase. Okay. All right, so we're going to go for this one. I'm going to install it. You

53
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:41,940
guys ready? This shouldn't take too long. I've got fiber optic internet. It's taking a little

54
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:58,179
longer than I thought. It won't even launch the game. Is it ready to go? I'm killing my internet

55
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:18,460
by doing this too. Okay. What was this called? Cult of the Lamb? Where is it? Where is it? I just

56
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:33,000
downloaded it. Where the fuck is it? Steam is not down. Is steam down? Steam is not down for

57
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:53,990
maintenance. Do not say that. What the fuck? What? It's down for maintenance? It's Tuesday. Oh, come

58
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:02,820
on. The second that I turned the stream on is... Oh my god. I thought I only had one more day for

59
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:13,860
this. I did not plan this. Why is fucking maintenance day? When does it start? When

60
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,860
is maintenance over in like an hour? I'll play Dread X maybe. Tell us a story. It's back up?

61
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:30,940
How would it be down for maintenance and back up in fucking two minutes? God damn it. All right,

62
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:56,600
let me see. Let me see. Is it there? Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Oh, tell us a story. What do

63
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:09,259
you want for a story? It's down. I still can't download anything. I did not plan this

64
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:24,539
I promise you. Restart steam. So do I need to restart steam? It's not down. It's back up for me.

65
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,929
When do they usually do this? Whatever. I just started. We're just gonna hang out. We're gonna

66
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:35,559
hang out. The downtime is only about five minutes. Yeah, then let's just hang out. Whatever. Guys,

67
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,720
it's not like World of Warcraft. They're not gonna bring steam down for like 12 hours every

68
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,610
day or every other day. Whatever it is. Every fucking horrible. Can you imagine if they did

69
00:11:45,610 --> 00:12:04,820
maintenance every other day for 12 hours? This game actually looks kind of fun. The expansion

70
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:15,289
launch. It's every week. Yeah, it's every week. I don't know. What are you saying? Talk about.

71
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:19,529
Oh shit. That's right. This is insane. Can I just show you something? Well, I can't. I don't know

72
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:25,960
if I can show you, but this is absolutely insane. So somebody in the community and let me just be

73
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,600
very, very honest with you here. I've told you this a thousand times before. Nobody listens to me when

74
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:41,080
I say this, but, but there is something really cool here. Somebody in the community is a fucking

75
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,139
scientist and they found. Let me get, let me get it out here. I gotta get some images here. This

76
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:56,730
is fucking crazy. If you want to look into it, you can. So let me, let me read this here. So,

77
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,570
uh, I have something really cool to share. This is by somebody in the community.

78
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:03,769
Are they comfortable with you sharing their name? I don't want to share their name if they're not

79
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:11,659
comfortable. Uh, but anyways, they discovered a new way of isolating viruses that kill antibiotic

80
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:19,299
resistant bacteria. Somebody in this community. And the first one I discovered using this method,

81
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:30,600
I named after German. This is a fucking goddamn discovery. They have pictures of the, of the

82
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:45,299
Petri dishes and this apparently is real. And they named it like the German nine, eight, five, like

83
00:13:45,299 --> 00:14:00,070
Eddie thing. I don't know what it is. Let me see if I can pull up an image here. Yeah. Let me just

84
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,379
show you the Petri dish. Cause we, we, we, we, we, we, we, this was shared with us. I was sitting

85
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:16,179
there going, Holy Oh my God. Take a look at this. No, it's not fake. This is real. It's the German

86
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:30,149
nine, eight, five. How do you pronounce that? So they're, they're okay with me sharing their name.

87
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,990
All right. Well, the name, the name, I'll give them, I'll give them the, the, the discord name.

88
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:40,679
The discord name is Jared da, Jared underscore dying discord. And they have some fucking

89
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,159
breakthrough medical research shit here. Like it's actually phenomenal. Uh, this is, it's

90
00:14:45,159 --> 00:15:16,889
blowing me away. Take a look at this. Take a look at this. Take a look at this. Hey, take a look at

91
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:31,480
this. That this is apparently it fucking working against bacteria, uh, antibiotic,

92
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:44,919
bacteria resistant shit. This is real. No, this is not a kid in high school biology. All right.

93
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:54,330
Stop saying that. This is like a fucking doctor scientist, but no, this, uh, I'm flattered. I

94
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:03,899
really wish you'd put your name on it. I didn't do this. No, they're not pancakes guys. This is,

95
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,379
and I said this out loud. This community has got a shitload of doctors, a shitload of scientists,

96
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:16,940
a shitload of, uh, creative, uh, editing artists. Uh, this, there's so many people in this

97
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:28,009
community. You're all doctors and scientists and I, I, I, I'm proving it today. You need to infect

98
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:36,009
yourself with this. I just like drink this. I drink like a potion with like a bunch of,

99
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,179
these are not pancakes. Do you guys know anything about scientific medical research? You don't know

100
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:54,379
anything, do you? That's me in there. That's me taking care of that. I'm in there and I'm

101
00:16:54,379 --> 00:17:04,150
getting all of those fucking molecules and I'm destroying them. Let me see this one.

102
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:15,829
Flooded second dilution set with the solution on it. Hold on. Is this, it's a plaque essay,

103
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,549
a pure, a purification. I'm not getting like gas lit, right? No, this is real. No, it actually is.

104
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:36,390
Steam's working. Well, I don't want to obviously put, I want to make sure this, uh, this person

105
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:41,609
doesn't get flooded, but I want to at least share a little bit of that because that's really cool.

106
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:47,720
Somebody found a way to target antibiotic resistant bacteria. Put your name on it,

107
00:17:47,720 --> 00:18:09,779
though. It deserves to be you, not me. You guys ready? It's real. Yes, it is. You're coming. No,

108
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:15,369
it's not. It's not gas lighting. It's no, it's not. I swear to God, it's not this. I just don't want

109
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,470
to like blow up this. I don't want it to be like, oh my God, everybody go like that. You know what

110
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,670
I mean? Like it's a cool thing. I just want to share it. All right, let's go. I'm going to try

111
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:39,380
to do this again. Let's see if it works. I believe you. Okay. You ready? Call to the lamb,

112
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:57,339
install demo. There we go. There we are. Just kidding. It didn't work. Let me try a different

113
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:06,299
one. You should play smite. I actually need to get ready. I got to play smite. I got to prepare.

114
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:15,299
You don't know what I'm talking about. I'm going to potentially be in a, in a tournament for smite.

115
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,930
Ms. Skip is holding a smite tournament and I was very vocal about how badly I wanted to be in it.

116
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,799
So I got to like practice. All right, let me try a different one. And maybe it's just that one's

117
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:44,390
fucked up. Okay. How about now? Will this one work? It just takes me to the store page and then

118
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:52,140
I can't download it. All right. So when I go to this, when I click on install demo, it takes me

119
00:19:52,140 --> 00:20:04,460
to the store page and then it says download and I can't download it. Same, same exact things happening

120
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,619
to us. Should I just open up dread X and just say, fuck it. Maybe I should restart steam. I'll try

121
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:24,549
restarting steam. This is, I like, this is cool. Just kind of hanging out, talking for a little bit.

122
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:33,160
Is it working fine now? There's music playing. It's, that's the trailer you're hearing.

123
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,960
The demos go away. The demos go until the 20th. So if you can't do it today, all right. Well,

124
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,589
I'm going to give this like five more minutes after I restart it. And if not, then we're just

125
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:56,789
going to do direct X like we were planning on doing anyways. So it's all good. It's all good.

126
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:04,599
Stretch the webcam out. It isn't kind of a weird spot, isn't it? No, I don't want to stretch it

127
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:12,329
out because it's going to screw up and I'm going to have to reset everything. I'm trying to get it

128
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:37,369
to work system. Okay. Come on. Anger foot install demo. No download. Nope. Let me try. Let me try

129
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:54,859
restarting steam again. Sunflower update. Haven't planted them. It was actually, here's the thing.

130
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,480
There's a lot going on in the next month or two that I was kind of scared that I wouldn't be able

131
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,950
to give them the attention that they deserved. So I was afraid to plant them. Oh, baseball,

132
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,109
baseball, baseball, baseball. We're going to talk about baseball. Yeah, whatever. I'm going to be

133
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:15,529
streaming all day today. So don't worry. I'm not going to leave in like three hours. So,

134
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:32,039
and you said it and now I'm thinking about it. I should have planted them. Yes. I have a custom

135
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:40,069
made cup of the sunflowers. Okay. Let me restart this baseball, baseball. Very important. Okay.

136
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:47,460
Listen, the baseball date has to change. It is no longer the 14th. It is not July 14th. The baseball

137
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,299
date is changing to July 20th. Only about six days. We had to do a lot of changes, a lot of stuff

138
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:01,930
with the venue and the, trust me, we didn't want to move it, but we had to. So only like six days

139
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,380
later, July 20th is a new date. I will let you know if anything else happens, if anything else

140
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:16,920
goes on behind the scenes, I'll let you know. You'll be first to know. We had no choice. And

141
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,269
when I say that, trust me, we had no choice. Had to do it. All right. With Steam. Open Steam, please.

142
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:42,470
I fucking hate computers. All right. Steam. God, I fucking hate computers. What the fuck is that?

143
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,910
All right. Come on. Does anybody confirm that it works? Otherwise I'm doing DreadEx.

144
00:23:46,470 --> 00:24:13,049
What happened to this? This is five minutes. Steam maintenance. Download something on Steam

145
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:19,369
right now. I'm downloading something literally right now. It's up. I just restarted it. The

146
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:32,170
stream is going to be like seven or eight hours, guys. Don't worry. I can't believe they would have

147
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:41,660
maintenance during the big event. Can't believe it. Wait, does he really think that Steam is down?

148
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:52,740
So what's happening? What are you talking about? There's no maintenance. You guys have made it up.

149
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:03,240
No, you didn't. Why would this not be working? All right. I'm about to throw a towel in and just

150
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:14,009
play DreadEx. Okay. I'm going to give this until, so the stream has been on for 25 minutes. If by

151
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:18,569
minute number 30, we don't have some progress here, I'm going to DreadEx and I'm just saying,

152
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:29,319
fuck it, whatever. Steam has maintenance every Tuesday. But why don't they, why do maintenance?

153
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,039
I know that this is a North American Andy talking, right? Do maintenance at like two in the morning.

154
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:49,460
Why do maintenance at fucking four o'clock in the afternoon? One, 12 midnight maintenance or

155
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:59,190
1 a.m. maintenance means that that's what? Like seven a.m. EU, six or seven a.m. EU. That's like

156
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:15,859
eight in the morning EU. That's all right. You can wait till like eight a.m. to play. You want

157
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:29,029
them to come into the office at 2 a.m.? No, I want them to unplug the router. What do they even do?

158
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,460
Speaking like someone that has no idea how this system even works. To me, always, I would always

159
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,390
get so, all right, let's talk about this for a second while we have time. I would always get so

160
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,500
mad at the Warcraft, World of Warcraft maintenance because it was, I just, in my brain, it was,

161
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,289
they were turning on and turning off the servers. That's, that was what they needed to do. And that

162
00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:01,509
was it. They just had to turn on, like, unplug and then turn it back on. But then it got me

163
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,069
thinking even more. What do you, what actually goes on during maintenance? Like what actually

164
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:10,789
is happening? Are they like clearing out a bunch of cash? What, what is maintenance? What is it?

165
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:17,500
What does that mean? Somebody can, can somebody enlighten me? What does that mean? When they say,

166
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:23,269
oh, every Tuesday, maintenance, what's that mean? What do they do? It's, it's, they're maintaining.

167
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:37,210
But what, what are they doing? Cash, backups, updating hardware, updating the system,

168
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:45,960
software updates, backups, hot fixes, hardware stuff. They're cleaning it with a toothbrush.

169
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:57,160
It's maintenance because in my brain, maintenance is always, oh, it's okay. What do you, what is

170
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:03,539
going on though? Are all these systems just barely functioning and every week we have to turn them

171
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:13,299
all off and it has to be a bunch of fucking crazy shit behind the scenes till they keep them on?

172
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:17,220
Oh yeah, guys, just a weekly maintenance, you know, just maintaining things, just making sure

173
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,670
everything works. Okay. Making sure that your stuff, your services are up. Not a big deal.

174
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:27,349
Just every, for a few hours every Tuesday, that's okay. But behind the scenes, it's like,

175
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:33,670
we are a sneeze away from everything turning off permanently. Every service we have is permanently

176
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:45,059
going to shut off. We're fucking hours away. Is that what it's, is that what it's like?

177
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:53,880
And I'm just sitting back here like, fucking turn on my game, idiot. And right now there is a guy

178
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,740
at like Steam, like Valve HQ, fucking running down a hallway with like a clipboard in his hand,

179
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,710
just like, okay, there's a fucking hundred fucking things I got to do. That system is in,

180
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:09,319
I see red. I see red. I got to go to that one now. I'm just sitting here waiting for them to

181
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:15,460
turn it on. And somebody is, is, is, is, there's a lot of drama going on behind the scenes.

182
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,750
Residence lever. Just relax. No, wake up. Don't relax even more. You'll fall asleep. Stay, wake

183
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:36,460
up. No, I don't want you to relax. I want you to like prep up a little. Is it working? It's been

184
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:50,259
30 minutes. Yeah, it has. All right. Does it work? Let's try. I'm going to try restarting. Come on.

185
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:59,700
Hey, hey, everyone that said the Steam is only going to be down for five minutes. It's been 30.

186
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:19,539
Okay. We're going to come on. Call to the lamb, install demo. Dude, come on. Try a different one.

187
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:26,089
I tried three already. Pick a different demo. All right. I'm going to try like a few of these.

188
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:30,150
It's all right. We're just hanging out. Don't worry. Okay. How about this one called potion permit.

189
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:39,049
Should I do this one? No, I'm clicking on install demo and it's just taking me to the store page.

190
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:55,259
Okay. So now there's a download demo and I click it and it just refreshes that game store page.

191
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:00,859
Exit Steam. I did. All right. I want to do this though. I so badly want to do this. This

192
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:09,319
will sound like a fun idea. Check your library. No, it's not there. Potion. Yeah, it's not even

193
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:15,660
here. I really wanted to do this. When I get on something, I have to do it. I can't just not do

194
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:27,180
it. Did you ban from Steam? No, I'm not. This dude's hallucinating. I am not hallucinating.

195
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:41,109
They're not even doing a demo thing. You made it up. All right. You know how I know that? No,

196
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:52,759
I did a test. I have one already installed. I did a test. I did a test. Okay. Let's go.

197
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,500
I downloaded one to test and we're just going to play it. Oh, fuck. Yeah. I'm excited. Let's do it.

198
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,819
Before the stream started, I wanted to make sure it worked. You know what? Sucks.

199
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:13,079
So before the stream started, I tested it. I got it set up. I'm going to have it like this,

200
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:19,019
check it, install. Okay. That works. I press the fucking goddamn stream button.

201
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:30,390
Steve is offline for an hour. Okay. No more resident sleepers. Are you going to make me

202
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,980
very upset? All right. The one that I downloaded to test, hopefully it's a good one. What should

203
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:47,769
be the best one of the night? Could be. Could be. This one's called Melatonin. We're going to try

204
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:55,369
it. Oh shit. I'm so glad I installed this one. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. No more

205
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:58,700
fucking around. I'm ready. We're going. We're already going. We're going. We're going. We're

206
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:12,309
going. Where is it? Got it. No, wake up. Oh, because the game's called Melatonin. Never mind.

207
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:18,039
All right. This is a demo. This is called Melatonin. Start the demo. Let's go. Let's go.

208
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:25,299
This game contains flashing effects like lights and colors that can affect player.

209
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:31,480
All right. So we got a warning here. We got a warning right off the bat. Just be

210
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:40,250
aware of that. So how does this work? Melatonin is a rhythm game that requires precise timing

211
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:47,900
for a dreamy experience. Make sure your sound is on and avoid using Bluetooth audio, bro, bro.

212
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:53,589
Okay. Let's start with the basics. Follow the rhythm and hit the space bar on beat with the

213
00:33:53,589 --> 00:34:18,940
moving circles. You're lagging. I know. I don't know why my internet's fucked up right now.

214
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,070
The music made it worse for me. I don't know why. Why is my internet fucked up?

215
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:47,139
It's Twitch. No, it's, I don't think so. It is. It's the fiber optic cables. I think it's, it's

216
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,780
whatever. What am I going to do about it, guys? Okay. That didn't feel right. Not that right.

217
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,280
Let's do a quick tutorial. Recognize an audio and visual cues and reacting to them at the right time

218
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,300
according to the rhythm. For the first lesson, pay attention to the cues. They will be hinting

219
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:18,940
for you to react on the fourth beat when the circles overlap. That went in the circle. Every

220
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,699
level in the game will eventually expect you to follow the cues without the visual guide.

221
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:30,380
Wait, other streamers are having connection problems? Oh, that's annoying. Maintenance,

222
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:46,170
maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Okay. Follow the

223
00:35:46,170 --> 00:36:00,139
cues and react with the left and right arrow keys. Left and right arrow keys. Remember,

224
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:04,460
you're having maintenance. Yeah, it's called when you sleep. You have maintenance every single day.

225
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:10,170
Your brain does maintenance every day. Okay. There must be times when you need to start

226
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,250
and end your reaction at different times. Hold the spacebar on the third beat and let go on the

227
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:27,639
fourth. Oh, all right. That's kind of cool. Unique set of audio and visual cues. There's a practice

228
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:34,539
mode too. Cool. If it gets too hard, you can enable the assist options. Okay. That's the end

229
00:36:34,539 --> 00:37:07,940
of the tutorial. Let's go. Well, this is like animated. What the hell? Whoa. It's an RPG.

230
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,019
Oh my God, guys. It's an RPG. I look probably crazy. Fuck. I hate cameras. I don't want a camera

231
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:28,519
in my house. I fucking hate this. What is this? Okay. This game is called Melatonin, by the way.

232
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,719
The demo is available on Steam whenever the maintenance ends.

233
00:37:37,139 --> 00:38:37,750
I like it. Oh shit. It's games like Rhythm Heaven. Yeah. What? All right. Let's do it. Score mode.

234
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:44,869
This is fun. Yeah. I would just keep it on games and demos because we're going to be doing a lot

235
00:38:44,869 --> 00:39:15,909
of them. So, all right, this is cool. I actually like this. Let's do it. Burger. It's not cat puke

236
00:39:15,909 --> 00:40:32,730
simulator. Shit. This is fucking cool. This is a good one. This is a good one. It's like Rhythm

237
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:42,139
Heaven. What are we doing out of five? This one's Melatonin. I'm going to give you a rating on it

238
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:50,940
once we can confirm with me that Steam demos are currently downloading for people. How is it? I

239
00:40:51,019 --> 00:41:05,110
think I might need a little bit more time with it. I think. Happy birthday to my friend Aaron.

240
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:10,389
Happy birthday, Aaron. The internet sucks. I don't know what's going on. Twitch's servers are fucked.

241
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:18,070
All right. Cool. That was cool. So, let's go. There's another one too. I want to do the other one.

242
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:34,679
The demo has what? Probably two, three levels. Whoa. This internet is really making me angry.

243
00:41:34,679 --> 00:42:22,420
Oh, what the hell? Sick. I'm going to get 100 on this one. Use the chip. Yeah. And then

244
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:31,699
freak out because you want to get it out of the machine before it makes the sound.

245
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:42,969
It's like here it is. It's in there. Please remove card. Got it. And if it goes through one cycle of

246
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:52,340
you fucked up and you're really embarrassed and like it's an anxiety time. What? Just buy it. Wait,

247
00:42:52,340 --> 00:43:11,269
what's going on? Restart. Is this right? Oh, I got it. And it's almost like I can tell when somebody's

248
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:20,940
judging the amount of as I had. Pause it so I can talk. I've put it in there before at the

249
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:28,139
grocery store, at Target, whatever. Best Buy doesn't matter. And you put a bag into the cart

250
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:35,260
and you hear, oh fuck. The second time it's like you fucked up, right? The second time it's like

251
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,630
that was you caused that problem. And if it happens a third time, it's almost like you can

252
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:51,860
feel the entire store all at the same time looking like get your fucking card. I hate it.

253
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,190
Yeah, I hate it. I don't like it. I make it like a nice sound, right? If the sound wasn't

254
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:27,079
like an iPhone alarm, I'm sure it would be fine. But restart, restart, restart. I get it. Oh,

255
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:44,300
Jeremy explaining. Imagine you were so rich that you buying millions of dollars in merchandise

256
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:53,340
is a fucking mini game. Can you imagine sitting there and they're like, wait, wait, hold on.

257
00:44:54,059 --> 00:45:38,150
Be like, you're a dick. You're a fucking asshole. I would not do that. Still can't download demos.

258
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:55,849
Jerma does this at Applebee's. What does that even mean? I don't know. I don't know what that

259
00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:04,949
means. I'm trying. I went after you said that I thought it was funny. But then at the same time,

260
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:10,969
I'm like, what is that person talking about? You get a bill at the very end. Does that mean

261
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:17,829
that I'm leaving and coming back and just, Hey, can you charge more breadsticks? Can I have another

262
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:22,710
bloom and onion? I just want to, you don't even swipe. They take your card and walk away with it.

263
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:40,570
Maybe I should try changing his Twitch servers. I might try that stream is going to turn off

264
00:46:40,570 --> 00:47:02,519
potentially, but we'll see if it doesn't get better. I'll try a different server. It looks

265
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:29,690
like we're dropping 2% of all frames. I don't like that. This game's really cool. I love rhythm

266
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:49,110
heaven. And this is a rhythm heaven game for PC. Let's go. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

267
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:24,699
The game is called melatonin on steam. It's a demo available. This is the steam demo day early.

268
00:48:30,420 --> 00:49:34,070
Wait, shoot. Where? Oh, melatonin. The game is melatonin. Should I put it in like the title or

269
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:39,539
something? All right, I'm going to try. Okay, here we go. I'm going to let me see something here.

270
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:50,119
Let me I gotta test something. I'm gonna see. Let me do this. I'm gonna see if I can change

271
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:53,400
Twitch server because last time this problem happened when Twitch was having server problems,

272
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,980
I switched to a different server and I found one that worked. So you want to try it? I think I

273
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:06,139
could try it. I'm dropping a lot of frames, 2.5% of every frame. I'll try that. Games are now

274
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:11,449
downloadable. Perfect. So let's restart. Let's just redo the stream, right? I haven't even gone live

275
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:18,550
yet. Let's just pretend I haven't gone live yet. You know what I'm saying? Okay, let's see.

276
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:26,420
What's it? Let me check. He's late. Yeah, just pretend I was late. Just tell everybody I was

277
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:41,320
late today by a lot. Let me see if this helps. Yeah, honestly, just pretend I was late. And by

278
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,239
the way, I'm going to be really mad if one person is not here when I come back in like a minute and

279
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:50,809
a half. Let me try this. Let me see if this helps. I'll be right back. Give me two seconds.

280
00:50:50,809 --> 00:51:41,909
It's going to restart. Try a different server. Fuck. Fuck. I'll be right back. Let's see if it

281
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:47,929
worked. I went to a different server. I'm sorry I'm wicked late. Oh, hold on. Let me do the...

282
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:57,460
No, who cares about the intro? No, it didn't work. Didn't work. Got worse. Fuck. No. Oh, come on.

283
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:19,980
Really? Oh, come on. We're just gonna have to deal with the other server because now it's worse.

284
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,280
Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance! Maintenance!

285
00:52:24,280 --> 00:53:07,269
Maintenance! I'll be right back again. We're just gonna have to deal with it. I think I'm not dropping

286
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:11,340
any more frames. I don't want to jinx it. I don't want to say it out loud. I don't want to say this

287
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:20,889
out loud. I think we're good. I ran a speed test. I tested to Twitch. I picked individual servers.

288
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:32,920
I went one by one by one. I think I got the right one. Fucking maintenance. All right. Give me a

289
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,099
second. I think we're good. I'm going to move a couple things around. We're not going to do

290
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:46,500
a starting screen because we already did that. Round two. That's right. Clueless. We'll see.

291
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:54,980
I'm actually kind of concerned, but whatever. He's on Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi Andy. Look at this beard.

292
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,829
Okay, you know those things? Where's the magnet and you drag the weird magnet hair

293
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:17,349
around the guy's face? I have magnet shavings and facial hair right now. Why am I weird looking?

294
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:23,559
What is it? Let's see. It's definitely like here and like here. You know what I mean?

295
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:37,900
Somebody said, yeah. Yeah. That's your face. I know. I'm just kidding. Welcome back, everybody.

296
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,159
Welcome to the show. I'm not going to tweet this stream out yet because I'm afraid to.

297
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:56,230
What's my... What's my... Why am I... I'm changing... I'm like white balance all fucked up.

298
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:11,800
Is this guy Morbius? It's the hair flip in the back. Yeah. I'm going to go line by line here.

299
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:19,159
Is this a secret stream? No. This is supposed to be a regular stream, but I got cut off a couple

300
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:30,550
hours ago trying to find a way back into the stream. And here we are. You look tired. Yeah,

301
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:41,900
tired of this shit. Tuesday maintenance on every fucking website. I'm tired of this shit. I'll

302
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:54,280
tell you that. Searching across the nation for a server I can stream to on Twitch. Late night

303
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,239
stream. Yeah. Well, it goes long. I don't want to go too, too long. I just want to... I wanted to

304
00:55:57,239 --> 00:56:05,260
stream today. I'm so busy, right? I'm really busy. Today, I wanted to stream today and tomorrow.

305
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:10,250
I'm trying to sprinkle streams in when I can while working on the projects and stuff.

306
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:15,269
I wanted to stream today. Why do your sideburns look like pubes?

307
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:43,510
Dude, I don't know. I haven't had a haircut in... Oh, man. You freak me out. I'm going to cut these

308
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:52,280
right now. That is weird. Anyways, whatever. You're self-conscious? No, I'm really not. I'm

309
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:58,340
very comfortable in my... I'm very comfortable with my own skin. I promise. I don't care.

310
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:16,230
You should sell your hair. The fuck are you talking about? No. Never. Are you wearing a

311
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:20,230
powdered wig? That'd be kind of funny if I was. All right. No drop frames. I think we're good to

312
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:26,010
go. I think we're ready. I wonder, is it because... Is my hair going back further on this side than

313
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:33,590
it is on this side? No, it's not. It's just the way that my hair sits. Because when it gets really

314
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:38,710
long like this, it sits weirdly. It makes my head look like it's going back this way a little bit.

315
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:49,610
He's balding. I mean, yeah. I'm 36. You wouldn't... Yeah, you dream you look like this when you're 36.

316
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:57,860
You dream. Keep dreaming you'll look as good as I do right now at 36. Keep dreaming. Wait, let me

317
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:15,260
say that again when it looks better. Do not say F, liar. Don't do that. It's more like a nightmare.

318
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:32,340
Okay. Okay. There's no F. I'm looking at it right now. I can see there's no drop frames.

319
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:38,820
All 5,000 of us. Holy shit. What was just happening there? Can I get it to stay there?

320
00:58:49,050 --> 00:59:01,699
Why does this look good? What's happening right now? This looks good. Why? Again, I got to get

321
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:07,480
away from... I'm just being an ego weirdo looking into a mirror. Because right now,

322
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,480
because I'm just sitting here, my OBS preview is right in front of my eyes. Usually it's over

323
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:23,460
here and I can't see it. Why does this look good? Am I fucking crazy or does this look good? This

324
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:35,219
looks good. Do I look good? This looks good, right? What's happening? Yeah, this looks fucking good.

325
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:46,150
Can you please say I'm gonna... No. You guys don't even... Sony put Morbius back in the theaters and

326
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:51,320
none of you assholes went to go see it. So no, I'm not going to do that. You didn't even see the

327
00:59:51,320 --> 01:00:07,219
movie. All right. I think we're good. Let me tweet this out. Let me tweet this out. You changed? No,

328
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:22,059
I didn't. You did. New tweet that's going to say, trying again. I wanted to fucking stream. We're

329
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:28,469
going to try the game demos. It seems to be that Steam is back. Please back up. I'm typing on my

330
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:38,599
phone. Relax. Should be trying again with a bunch of like the crazy, like the face like, I'm crazy,

331
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:47,820
whatever, that emote, whatever it's called. What's that called? What is that? What is that

332
01:00:47,820 --> 01:01:00,150
emote? What's that emoji called? It's called Zany. I was very upset before. I'm sorry, but I was.

333
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:13,420
How can a streamer stream without a proper internet, a proper server to connect to? It's

334
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:20,570
annoying. It's like a surgeon going in for surgery and they're just like, oh hey, yeah, you ready to

335
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:30,099
do your surgery? Yes, I'm ready. Oh, well, there are no tools. You have to use your bare hands.

336
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:43,159
I guess I'm just going to go home. He's comparing himself to a surgeon. I'm not comparing myself to

337
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:49,960
a surgeon. I'm just saying that the tools that I need to be able to stream, if they're not here,

338
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:56,389
I can't stream. Stop looking at yourself. Stop it. I got to get this off. Get away. I just like,

339
01:01:56,389 --> 01:02:01,110
what's wrong with me? What's that? Is there a bird or an animal that like, if it looks at its

340
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:06,980
reflection, it just can't, it just sits there for an hour. I'm not even egotistical about this. I

341
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,900
just sometimes locked into this guy talking in front of me right over here. This guy in front

342
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:24,809
of me is talking and I'm looking at him. Okay, let's go. Okay. What's the title? The title should

343
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:32,389
probably be different, right? I would imagine. Let's get, oh, that's right. I want to move this

344
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:39,619
down. All right. So I got called to the limb. We're going to try that. This is the demo stream

345
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:44,739
and I might just do this tomorrow too, because I want to be able to do it tomorrow rather than

346
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:49,829
just kind of, I don't know how long the stream is going to be, but I couldn't go out on that bad one

347
01:02:49,829 --> 01:03:00,519
a few hours ago. Not going to happen. Okay. Put that here. Now I need, what do I need? Okay.

348
01:03:02,539 --> 01:03:11,690
All right. So I need, where's my discord? Where the hell is that? There it is. Okay. And then I

349
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:21,059
need this website. Give me one sec. All right. So I'm going to open up a call to the lamb. That's

350
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:27,349
the first one that I downloaded. If you don't know what we're doing, I will give you another look.

351
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:35,579
On steam, there is this huge list of demos that are available for the next week. Every single,

352
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38,940
there's a thousand of these. They're all coming soon. Most of them are, and you can download

353
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:45,690
demos of them. I'm going to pick random shit here and we're just going to see how it goes.

354
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,409
We've already, that game melatonin was really cool and I want to keep doing this. I think it's a

355
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:55,880
really fun idea. So we're going to start with call to the lamb. I already have it installed

356
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:06,809
because I knew I was going to be doing it. So let's get it open, see if it's any good.

357
01:04:09,239 --> 01:04:21,929
This game looks cute. We'll find out, won't we? And three, two, one, go. Massive monster. So what's

358
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:27,000
this game about? It's a demo. We're going to find out. Is it too loud? Can you hear anything?

359
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:40,550
That's not what I wanted to do. Yeah, I know. I do. Who cares about your desktop background?

360
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:47,539
Do you really care? It's nice. It's like a beach with, it's, it's, I don't care. I don't need,

361
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:53,909
I don't need a desktop background. It's cool. I don't care. I don't look at my desktop background.

362
01:04:53,909 --> 01:05:04,630
I don't care. Press X. Wait, X as in X or X as in, is it basic background? Yeah, you don't need

363
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:23,559
anything more than that. Is it too dank? Is it? Okay. You stop being a minimalist. I don't have a

364
01:05:23,559 --> 01:05:26,599
desktop background. It doesn't make me a minimalist. All right. This is, what is this game called?

365
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:35,289
Cult of the Lamb demo. Let's check it out. This is a controller game for sure. Guaranteed, right?

366
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:46,250
Okay. All right. I like the style so far. Work in progress. Okay. Let's go.

367
01:05:48,280 --> 01:06:03,690
This is, this is cool looking so far. So far it's a five out of five. Magicka Wizard Wars.

368
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:14,280
Mousepad Andy. Really? Really? No, don't fucking derail this. I just got it started. I just was

369
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:22,019
able to get it to go live. I'm not derailing it already. It was two hours of derailment last time.

370
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:35,460
Kneel to be sacrificed. Okay. For this sacrifice, the prophecy will be impossible to fulfill.

371
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:41,300
The heretic lies bound below will be condemned to eternal captivity, and the old faith shall

372
01:06:41,300 --> 01:07:02,840
be preserved. Oh, these are old gods. Am I dead? Is this game like Binding of Isaac? What's this

373
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:15,219
game like? Come closer if you're not. Though you are already dead, I still have need of you.

374
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:19,539
Those foolish bishops thought they could keep you from me in death, but instead they sent you

375
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:27,320
straight to me. I will give you life again, but at a price. All I ask is you just start a cult in

376
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:35,989
my name. Do we have a deal? Um, you're sure. Wise choice. Take the red crown which I once wore with

377
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:39,590
it. You shall command the loyalty of followers and strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.

378
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:45,750
By the way, this is called Cult of the Lamb demo. What am I doing? That was weird. That was weird.

379
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,389
I don't know what that was. That was very fucking weird. That was strange.

380
01:07:52,059 --> 01:08:03,420
Once you've done so, you'll see me again. All right, so I let the old god out,

381
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,210
put the old god's crown on, and now I have the power of the old god. Remember,

382
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:15,380
this is Cult of the Lamb demo. What's wrong with you? A lot of things, man. Where do you want me

383
01:08:15,380 --> 01:09:04,359
to start? Whoa. This game suck. All right. Okay. If you're not, I am Rato. I was once a chosen

384
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:09,739
vessel like you, but those days are lost to the winds. I was sent to guide you where deep in the

385
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:12,460
lands of the old faith and engraved danger. This game is actually really fun so far.

386
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,850
Lead you to safety. Continue through the woods. Escape lies ahead. I'll be close by.

387
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:25,880
Yeah, so this is again for everybody that's joining us. These are all demos on Steam right

388
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:33,579
now for games that may or may not be coming out soon. There's a whole event. Would have loved to

389
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:47,510
have been doing this all day. Yeah, so it is kind of like minding my inventory. Coin. Is it currency?

390
01:09:47,510 --> 01:10:08,539
Those are probably traps, right? Do I have a health bar? One coin. I got two coins. I love

391
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:12,619
the art style. It's kind of like this kind of pop-up book. That's really cool. I like it.

392
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:40,310
Who's the composer? I don't know. Good question. This is good. It feels very clean. I would say it

393
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:49,590
controls exceptionally well. Exceptionally well. The movement's fun. It's very fluid. Animations

394
01:10:49,590 --> 01:11:05,829
look great. There's no screen shake, which by the way, why God, why God, God, why does every

395
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:15,659
fucking game studio now put screen shake in every single game? Why is it in every game?

396
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:49,109
Why is it there? I can't stand this new trend. I can't take it. No, it's not here. Hold on now.

397
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:58,970
Hold on a second. Everybody wait. They, why is it in every game? I don't get this. I downloaded and

398
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:06,039
started to play, just because I was curious, Diablo Immortal. And let me just be very clear

399
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:16,779
about this. Fuck that game. Fuck that game. For a reason that you might not understand.

400
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:24,250
Every time you swing the weapon in Diablo Immortal as a melee character, a default swing,

401
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:38,699
your fucking iPad shakes. You can't turn it off. It drives me crazy, crazy. I'll sit,

402
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:47,720
it hurts my eyes just watching the screen shake. And I do this thing a lot of times where I type

403
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:54,119
into Google Diablo Immortal screen shake sucks, just to get the confirmation bias from myself

404
01:12:54,119 --> 01:13:09,979
that other people agree with me. And I can't find it. I can't find it. Nobody agrees with me. Turn

405
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:20,020
those off too. But man, I don't know. Screen shake doesn't add anything. It's just annoying.

406
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:26,229
It's annoying. It doesn't add anything to the game. It's just obnoxious. I don't,

407
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:43,770
am I crazy? Have I lost my mind? He's a boomer. No, I am not. I am not a boomer.

408
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:50,140
It's a screen shake in every game now. I never remember a time when I used to play game. Okay,

409
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:57,939
this is, I just said used to whatever, where I had to turn a slider down. So my monitor didn't

410
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:14,199
shake. Oh, I hated it. Everyone's talking about Diablo Immortal's like pay to win bullshit.

411
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:38,260
I am like the screen shakes and I uninstalled it. Cool. We've reached safety. You've done well.

412
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:47,159
Okay. Someone tell him his monitor doesn't shake physically. I think he's afraid of damaging his

413
01:14:47,159 --> 01:15:01,609
computer. I want to add screen shake to my streams. Let's see how you guys like it.

414
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:09,050
Every time I talk loud, the edges of your visual is going to go like this, like this.

415
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:27,260
I don't get it. This game. All right. This one's good. We're going to get this one five more

416
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:39,909
minutes. Oh, also Diablo more. Oh, do I even really? I mean, everybody's already had their

417
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:43,109
take of this game so far. Do I really have to add myself to the takes of Diablo Immortal?

418
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:48,020
Do I have to give you my Diablo Immortal take? I mean, you've heard everybody's given their take

419
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:50,739
every single person. You don't need to be, I don't have to give it to you, but I might.

420
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:58,229
Okay. All right. I will. There are 15 items in Diablo Immortal that are there. There are literally

421
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:06,199
15 items in the game, whatever it is. It's just like you run these rifts to get the same like 15

422
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:17,050
gems. There are 15 items in the whole game. All the other stuff. I don't know. Who cares?

423
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:35,239
Let the anger flow through you. Speak. Speak. Okay. So I got a follower. Indoctrinate into cult.

424
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:54,140
What? Wait, you make, you can make your own like cult members? Why? I want the pig. Variant?

425
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,590
Just say microtransactions are bad. That's that's really not even what I mean, though. I just mean

426
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:10,739
that there are actually like 13 or 14 items in the game that you try to get. The whole time I was

427
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:15,699
playing through the portions Diablo Immortal, just on my iPad, because I'm an iPad gamer.

428
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,899
I'm just sitting there going like none of this other gear. I don't care. Like this gear doesn't

429
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:25,880
matter. I'm just opening a box at the end of a dungeon and hoping that one like a five star

430
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:31,739
version of the same 15 items shows up. It was just, it just ruined everything. I was like this,

431
01:17:31,739 --> 01:17:39,380
this is this is ruining the entire experience for me. Okay, I can give, can I change these?

432
01:17:40,659 --> 01:17:45,060
Lose minus five faith whenever another follower dies or ignore dissenters when they preach.

433
01:17:45,619 --> 01:18:03,079
Minus five faith when a follower is sacrificed. Huh. Okay. Chop trees? Okay. Wait, what?

434
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,159
Your cult will grow powerful, but your followers cannot live on prayer alone. They must eat.

435
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:20,390
This game's sick. How come Jerma is at a different hue right now? Because I don't know, man. I'm tired.

436
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:44,979
Okay. Build. Build it. Collect. Oh, I have to do it myself. Okay. I can't chop that tree down.

437
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:50,760
Wait, is that progress bar that small? Why did I pick the biggest tree at the camp?

438
01:18:53,159 --> 01:19:11,399
That was stupid. Okay, I'll do that one later. Cool. No, but like, okay, micro transactions.

439
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:18,659
Look, I'm not going to sit here and go off on micro transactions. You've heard everybody give

440
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:26,710
that take. My take is get screen shake out of your fucking video games. That's the most important

441
01:19:26,710 --> 01:20:03,979
takeaway. Stop talking. I'm a live streamer, man. Can I help? Okay, so let's build it.

442
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:09,210
This is supposed to be demo night, but this game is good. All right, I'm going to move on a minute.

443
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:20,420
We're going to do one more minute or this is how I'll end it. If you're going to have screen shake,

444
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:30,229
please be like these god tier developers and make it so I can turn it off. Be like these god tier

445
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:41,720
devs that knew and they decided to make it available if you turn it off. The demo is just 30

446
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,520
minutes. All right, cool. The followers need to eat. It's up to you to provide meals for them.

447
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:52,409
The hunger of your cult can be seen in the top left of the screen. When this gets low,

448
01:20:52,409 --> 01:20:59,399
followers will begin to starve. Find more food while crusading. Pick routes that pass through

449
01:20:59,399 --> 01:21:04,630
foraging locations. Plant farms to grow your own food. Seems to be purchased while crusading.

450
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:23,880
Like berries? When is this going to come out? I want to play this. Oh, I have to hold it. All

451
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:38,520
right, you can cook food. I only have one follower so far. What's this game called? This game is

452
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:46,279
called Cult of the Lamb. Cult of the Lamb. So far so good. Okay, let's cook some food.

453
01:21:52,949 --> 01:22:03,859
15% chance of the follower pooping instantly. That's weird. What'd I just do? What'd I just do?

454
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:22,600
Oh. Oh wait. Okay. So is that pig going to eat this? I need more followers.

455
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:35,579
Okay. Slay them. Go find gold and find recruits. All right, this game's cool.

456
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:51,060
Yep, this is a good one. Kill M. Deuceous. One follower Andy. Hey, you gotta start somewhere.

457
01:22:51,699 --> 01:23:02,600
You gotta start somewhere. You don't just wake up one day with... How many followers do I have? 50?

458
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:31,220
Okay, Darkwood. All right, I guess we're just going to Darkwood, right? Who made this game? I have to

459
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:39,159
read this. Jerma, if you were dreaming right now, would you show us your penis? You know how many

460
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:44,359
times I've panicked in my dreams about something like that happening? Why would I do that deliberately

461
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:59,300
in my dream? Mods let that pass. No, I caught it before it got deleted. Would you stop? All right.

462
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:07,449
Oh, items. Quiet. You didn't have to read that. That person needs to know. They need to be corrected.

463
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:26,970
Okay, I want this one. Hell yeah. Let's go. Wait, I take them both? Dude, you take them both.

464
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:52,039
Whoa, this is good. Oh yeah, this is a fun game. This is a fun one. Absolutely. Put this one on

465
01:24:52,039 --> 01:25:18,260
your wish list for sure. Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is this? Praise Lamb, conduit to great power,

466
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:24,420
promise liberator of the one that waits below. So the card showed me once many lifetimes ago,

467
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:29,300
or has that yet to be. I always have drawn your cards, Lamb, and yet this is the first.

468
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,739
Take these cards and I will draw another each time we meet. When drawn by me, they will grant

469
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:36,819
you a power. A power that's both known and unfathomable. The cards they shall decide.

470
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:57,670
I think this one. Yeah, whatever. Okay, cool. Got it. Tarot cards. Oh, these ones I have unlocked.

471
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:13,829
All right. I only have three hearts. Everybody be careful. Oh, there's food. Nice. Nice. Does

472
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:37,020
this get the German 985 stamp of approval? Yes. What's going on? Whoa, what? How can this be?

473
01:26:37,579 --> 01:26:42,619
You were put to the blade, Lamb, as all your kind were, and yet here you stand before me,

474
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:50,340
unrepentant. The crown has power, could it be? But I am stronger still, turn tail and run little Lamb.

475
01:26:51,060 --> 01:27:12,310
Leshy, wait, inscription? Interesting. Okay, inscription. All right, everybody show of hands.

476
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:16,630
How many people listen to the angler's theme song at least once every couple of weeks?

477
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:27,100
And just sit there in your chair and go like, let's do the question mark.

478
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:48,659
Whoa, that's a good room to go in. The angler from inscription. One of the bosses.

479
01:27:54,470 --> 01:28:01,180
You guys don't know what the angler theme song from inscription is? How dare you show up here?

480
01:28:01,659 --> 01:28:22,170
Play it. I'll play it after this. I'm going to die. I got to be a better gamer than this.

481
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:37,800
I'm kind of sad that this is just a demo. I want to play the rest of this game.

482
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:56,659
All of these different weapons. Pogjam.

483
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:14,310
When slaying a foe, I'm talking. When slaying foe, summon a ghost that will attack nearby enemies.

484
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:24,060
Cool. Projectile that spreads. What? Should I try this? This is a projectile.

485
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:40,460
You can recycle stuff too. What does recycle mean? Wait, what? Oh, that's cool.

486
01:29:41,020 --> 01:30:05,539
It's just huge range. All right, recycle it. Ah, it's money. Got it. Nice. Nice. Press Y.

487
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:27,699
Yeah, I've been wasting it like a fool. Oh, it puts that tar on the ground. All right,

488
01:30:27,699 --> 01:30:40,659
I got to kill the boss. Bat chest. Flower necklace. Oh, I think this is the boss.

489
01:30:41,300 --> 01:31:07,350
Let's go. How do I build up the meter? This game rocks. It does. I would have moved on

490
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:42,970
a long time ago. I want to see this demo to the end. Land the 1C3 combo. Oh, that one. What hit

491
01:31:42,970 --> 01:31:52,760
me? Are we dropping frames? Nope. Good. So, see what I mean? It's just so fucking weird. It makes

492
01:31:52,760 --> 01:32:04,439
no sense. You've gone far enough. My followers are willing to do anything for me. Can you say

493
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:10,489
the same of yours? I give myself to the cause, oh mighty leader. By the blood of the great ones,

494
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:57,300
destroy the red crown. Amdusius. Oh, wait, I can, I, really? Convert me to your cult,

495
01:32:57,300 --> 01:33:09,539
I will follow your teachings faithfully. Ah, 13 berries, follower form, or berry bush,

496
01:33:09,539 --> 01:33:30,340
berry bush, berry bush, berry bush, berry bush. That one. Very cool. My face is so itchy with this

497
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:40,119
beard. Locked. Return to cult. Is that it? Did I get to the end? Did I reach the end of the demo?

498
01:33:46,489 --> 01:34:03,720
That's it? When does this come out? Oh, no. Ah, August 11th. All right, write that down and

499
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,579
put it in the recommended. I want to play this game. This game's cool. All right, what's next?

500
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:12,579
That was, that was cult of the land. Put it on your steam watch list. I would highly recommend it.

501
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:26,470
What else do I want to do? Do anger foot. Hold on. Let's, let's, I thought I just got electrocuted

502
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:36,550
for one second. I was like, I'm getting electrocuted. Uh, okay. So now let's go down here.

503
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:54,619
What do we got next? Anger. Hold on. Let me move this a little. Anger, anger foot. This looks pretty

504
01:34:54,619 --> 01:35:08,970
good. This looks cool. Hold on. What else? Midnight fight express potion permit roots of Pacha

505
01:35:09,930 --> 01:35:17,979
renowned. These all look, these all look wicked fun. What happened? Am I, do I just not pay

506
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:24,779
attention to anything or is this just a shitload of good games that they're curating? All right,

507
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:28,300
we'll do anger foot and I'm going to, I'll put on the, uh, the angler theme so you can understand

508
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:39,260
what I'm talking about. Anger foot is coming up. It's cause they're new. This is cool. I didn't know

509
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:44,520
it was going to be like this. Yeah. So people don't know what they're here. This is what I'm

510
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:58,550
talking about for those of you that need to know. The song is crazy. It's very, it's very simple,

511
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:06,460
but it gets, I just think it's cool. You ready? This is the one. This is the song I was talking

512
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:40,600
about. Play the Trapper song. I'm sorry. The Trapper song is not the angler.

513
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:48,680
That's not going to get played on my broadcast. I'm sorry. You're a psycho. What I, what, why?

514
01:36:51,579 --> 01:37:00,340
Actually, that is like kind of weird, isn't it? Why am I listening to like scary jaws type music,

515
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:18,039
right? I'm listening to like a scary song. That's not the only thing I listened to.

516
01:37:18,039 --> 01:37:24,069
The meat grinder calls. No, I, the whole soundtrack I listened to. I just think this one's really,

517
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:31,770
this one's really cool. I just, I just see the kind of scene play out where he's like at the

518
01:37:32,729 --> 01:37:42,390
whatever. I don't care. I don't care. All right, let's go. You guys ready? I'm trying to get this

519
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:47,560
really streamlined here so we can make it very quick. Very, actually hold on a minute.

520
01:37:48,869 --> 01:38:00,340
Where's my Twitch dashboard? Who took it? So we're going to do Angerfoot coming up here. Cool.

521
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:16,279
Oh, I am logged in. That's fine. Good. What is this title? Delayed, delayed demo day D stream

522
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:31,350
D stream. What is a D stream? Okay. Let's check it out. You guys saying this one's good. Let's

523
01:38:31,350 --> 01:39:09,909
see if you're, if you're accurate. I know that this is devolver again is 92 high for this timer.

524
01:39:09,909 --> 01:39:22,890
Is there already this timer already? Where am I going? Where am I going? Holy shit. This

525
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:50,949
game's fucking incredible. This game is amazing. Why don't these games come out? Am I just, do I

526
01:39:50,949 --> 01:39:54,310
don't play video games? That was amazing. That was some of the most fun I've ever had in my life.

527
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:01,289
That was some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life. In my entire life.

528
01:40:01,289 --> 01:40:49,560
Okay, cool. Let's go. Let's do it. Level two. Oh, this is fucking crazy. I'm dead. Fuck. Why is he

529
01:40:49,560 --> 01:41:37,180
twerking? I'm confused. How do I reload? No, give me that gun. How do you reload? Damn, this is good.

530
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:59,130
This game gives me a headache. Yeah, me too, but it's fun. I got it. I got it.

531
01:42:00,329 --> 01:42:18,939
I gotta hold. Okay, don't shoot the gun. This screen shake. This, no, it's not, it's different.

532
01:42:20,659 --> 01:42:25,699
Yeah, it is screen shake. I'm kicking doors into people's faces and I'm punching exploding walls.

533
01:42:26,819 --> 01:42:45,699
Okay, I gotta get it right. I gotta hold. There it is. Why are they, what kind of toilet is that?

534
01:42:45,699 --> 01:43:28,819
What? Where the fuck am I going? I don't know. Uh, what? Where do I go? Should I be doing this?

535
01:43:28,819 --> 01:43:48,149
What? Oh, come on. What the hell is that? I don't even know what,

536
01:43:48,149 --> 01:44:04,729
what direction am I supposed to be going? Oh shit. Oh, okay. This is cool. Again, this is called

537
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:23,529
Angerfoot. Okay, for a second. I thought, I thought I was naked. I'm not going to kick the

538
01:44:23,529 --> 01:44:42,869
table over, am I? Oh, no, I don't want, this is, this is fucking weird. I'm just so bad.

539
01:44:54,699 --> 01:44:58,859
Somebody said, put it, no, I, oh, I don't want to do that.

540
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:05,020
I don't want to do that. No, don't, don't do it. Don't do it. Oh,

541
01:45:05,020 --> 01:45:22,260
no. Do I answer the phone? Hey, want some wine? Here, have some wine.

542
01:45:26,859 --> 01:45:34,710
He's going to puke. I'm not going to puke. I can't, I'm trying to give the wine over here.

543
01:45:37,479 --> 01:45:51,539
Oops. Do I have to pick it up with my foot? No, put the fucking popcorn down.

544
01:45:52,500 --> 01:46:10,039
You'll regret interfering with the crime gang. Oh, this is fucking funny. Check your fax machine.

545
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:55,189
How am I breaking shit? I mean, I can't read it. This is so fucking weird. Oh shit.

546
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:37,850
This one's hard. Okay. Blow it up. Blow it up. Blow it up. That was pretty dank.

547
01:47:45,300 --> 01:48:33,109
Oh, fuck you. Can you please smoke cigarettes on stream? What are you talking about?

548
01:48:33,909 --> 01:49:10,710
What's wrong with you? What are you, why are you saying that? Come on out.

549
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:36,020
Oh, a secret. Oh my God. What am I doing? Why would I do that in reverse?

550
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:41,300
I should have done that the other way. Why did I do that that way? That was stupid. Dumbass.

551
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:52,020
What the fuck are you talking about? Shit. Oh, this game is so good. This is the best game ever.

552
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:55,060
It's so addicting. I can't stop. And then, and it's going to end soon. I know it.

553
01:50:56,500 --> 01:51:31,189
Oh my God. Okay. This game is so good. I'm going to lose my mind. Yo, you, you weren't even close.

554
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:49,670
I'm addicted. Where's the other guy? Where's the other guy? Where's the other guy?

555
01:51:50,390 --> 01:52:37,430
Where's the other guy? Fuck. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, get out.

556
01:52:37,430 --> 01:53:10,100
Holy shit. This is wild. How's everybody doing? You guys doing all right? New weapons.

557
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:47,989
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What's that? Drink soda. Oh my God. What is it?

558
01:53:50,899 --> 01:54:06,010
Oh, I don't like to, I'm not drinking one of these ever again. I beat the level. This is like hot

559
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:15,689
light. Way too dank. Is it too dank? I'll turn it down. Is it too dank? Are we all right? We good?

560
01:54:21,430 --> 01:54:39,079
Wait, I can change the tacky town? Whoa. Great for kicking doors and kicking ass.

561
01:54:39,079 --> 01:54:47,529
Regain ammo with every kill. I'll take those. All right. So I get ammo with every kill.

562
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:56,020
Oh, new shoes. Nice. These look good. Wait, did I just do this?

563
01:55:04,279 --> 01:55:13,050
I just did this. How come it's the same little turn it up louder. I'll think about it.

564
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:54,659
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh shit. Where am I going? Okay. So why did I do that twice?

565
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:15,720
Level five level. Oh, there we go. Level six. That's a grenade. Wait, where do I go? Oh,

566
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:21,960
I probably kicked the grenade back, right?

567
01:56:43,479 --> 01:57:18,939
Huh? Huh? Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh shit. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got it.

568
01:57:18,939 --> 01:57:25,060
I got it. Do start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Start over. Do it again.

569
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:28,500
Start over. Start over. Whatever. Don't start. Whatever. My nose is bleeding.

570
01:57:29,220 --> 01:58:16,619
I got crushed. Let's go. I missed the days when you didn't do cocaine on stream. Turn the volume

571
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:25,180
back up. I know level seven. This is a pretty long demo. New gun. All right. This is what is.

572
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:37,590
Oh shit. All right. I'm going to die in one hit. You didn't deny. I don't do. I don't do drugs

573
01:58:37,590 --> 01:59:06,170
besides Marrow marijuana enemy. Do you count Tylenol? He admitted to it. Yeah. I take Tylenol

574
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:22,899
sometimes. Who cares? Sometimes don't overdo it. No, no, no, no, no, no. Too many people.

575
01:59:48,659 --> 02:00:47,000
Oh, come on. Please give me a break. Turn it back up. This sucks. Oh my goodness. Fine. Go.

576
02:00:55,989 --> 02:01:05,699
The health. All right. I gotta be careful here. Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

577
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:28,760
I missed the barrel. This game really has that one more time mentality on it.

578
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:43,189
What are you doing to me? What is going on? What the fuck? I keep dying. I keep exploding.

579
02:01:47,270 --> 02:02:26,470
Oh my God. It's the barrel. Let's freaking go. I have an idea. Where's that pistol? All right.

580
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:32,659
I have an idea. Here's my idea. Ready? Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

581
02:02:32,659 --> 02:02:59,539
run, run, run, run. Got it. Okay. Now where was my shotgun? I want my shotgun back. How do I get out

582
02:02:59,539 --> 02:03:51,750
of here? Nice. Oh, this is the end of the demo. Probably right. No, I blew it. Fuck. That would

583
02:03:51,750 --> 02:05:28,340
have been so cool if I got it. What? My computer. Holy shit. This game is so hard. Fuck. How did I

584
02:05:28,340 --> 02:06:06,539
miss with every shot? What am I doing? Am I drinking? Is this alcohol? I don't know where

585
02:06:06,539 --> 02:06:57,319
to go. There was no reason to do what I just did. That was stupid. What? What happened? That was

586
02:06:57,319 --> 02:07:48,970
so clean. What was going on? What the hell happened? This game's fucking crazy, man.

587
02:08:29,939 --> 02:09:05,239
Is he dead? All right. We're good. Okay. Now what keeps happening here? Seriously?

588
02:09:06,119 --> 02:10:05,060
Okay. They blew up the whole room. Who cares? Go. Oh my God. My feet went in the air.

589
02:10:05,060 --> 02:10:30,220
I like dove in there with two feet. Nice. Just seeing if I hear auto. Is that auto?

590
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:48,149
I've got like music blasting in my ears. It's kind of hard to hear. Damn. All right.

591
02:10:48,149 --> 02:11:21,079
Those guys got shields. Okay, sirs. Blow it up. Blow it up. What the hell? Thank God. Oh my God.

592
02:11:21,880 --> 02:12:00,710
This game is too fun. I can't stop playing it. That's the strategy right there. Oh, come on.

593
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:38,250
I almost got in. Fuck. I think Jerma is doing exactly what they would do. What? What's going

594
02:12:38,250 --> 02:13:00,359
on? Why is it already freaking out? What's wrong? Am I hallucinating? No, I'm not. I don't think it's

595
02:13:00,359 --> 02:14:19,189
talking shit. It's impossible. The game's impossible. I want a pistol. No, I don't want it.

596
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:42,300
Oh my goodness. There's a lot of people in that room. Oh my God. Does it matter? I don't get it.

597
02:14:43,180 --> 02:15:52,409
Shit. What do I do? Fuck out of here. Level 10. This game is cracked out. I love it.

598
02:15:53,689 --> 02:16:49,270
That guy exploded. Why did that guy explode? Whoa. He's got a machine gun. Give me that

599
02:16:49,270 --> 02:17:05,379
shotgun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? Nothing. Come on, computer. Stop lagging.

600
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:29,079
Not going to fool me with that bullshit. Give me the shotgun. I thought someone was just knocking

601
02:17:29,079 --> 02:18:09,450
on my door. Oh, fuck. Oh my God. There's too many people. Holy shit. New shoes. All right,

602
02:18:09,450 --> 02:18:21,000
we got to wait. We got new shoes. Blasters. Charge up a powerful long distance kick. I'll try it.

603
02:18:24,180 --> 02:18:37,510
Wait more floaties. So soft. You feel like you're floating away. I kind of want to try these.

604
02:18:38,229 --> 02:19:14,059
I think this is a boss level. Oh, it's somebody. Okay. Goop cop. What? I need a gun. Is there a gun?

605
02:19:37,540 --> 02:20:14,709
Don't go off the edge. Oh boy. I went off the edge. Idiot. Oh shit. I got hit right in the head.

606
02:20:15,510 --> 02:21:25,639
That was a good shot. Don't do it. Whoa. No. What the fuck? Why?

607
02:21:26,600 --> 02:22:06,459
Okay. Stop it. Oh my God. All right. Back up. Back up. Back up. I need a hill.

608
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:45,059
Give me different shoes. I want different shoes. Floaties. Turn doors into bombs. All right.

609
02:22:47,260 --> 02:23:05,340
How do these work? Whoa. Okay. That might actually be a problem. Wait, why are they all floating? Why

610
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:17,370
is everybody floating? Wait, everybody gets the shoes. Everybody gets them. I get it.

611
02:23:18,170 --> 02:24:15,270
Does that work? Is that doing damage or no? No. All right. Don't be an idiot. There it is. Got it.

612
02:24:15,270 --> 02:24:37,479
All right. Let's start with me a little. What? Oh God. What's going on? What's he dropping? Oh,

613
02:24:37,479 --> 02:25:01,020
he's dropping bombs. Why will this not hurt you? Everybody's floating around. I don't know who's

614
02:25:01,020 --> 02:25:37,030
alive. What the fuck? Don't hit me. All right. Is that it? Did I get it? Oh my God. There's a

615
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:48,969
phase three. They're just in a car now. Holy shit. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

616
02:26:21,719 --> 02:26:41,579
Don't even. Holy shit. That almost took my whole head off. That almost took off my head. Damn.

617
02:26:47,420 --> 02:27:00,440
I mean, that was amazing. Can I get that a five? I think that one deserves a five. Yeah. That was

618
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:08,020
a demo. That demo was more fun than some whole games I've played. That's definitely a five. First

619
02:27:08,020 --> 02:27:25,299
five of the night. Damn. Very cool. All right. What's next? Let's take a look. When does this

620
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:38,120
come out? That's a good question. 2023. All right. That's a little wait, but it'll be worth it.

621
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:49,930
That was phenomenal. Like straight up phenomenal. Okay. Let's go back and take a look at the list

622
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:56,219
here and see what else I want to try. Guys, should we just do this tomorrow too? I think we just do

623
02:27:56,219 --> 02:28:10,899
this tomorrow to agent 64. Okay. This is actually really, really fun. I really like this a lot.

624
02:28:10,899 --> 02:28:20,500
Okay. Agent six, this one here. I think I got it. Do I have this one already? Agent 64 spies never

625
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:29,989
die. I think I installed this one when I was kind of away for an hour. Agent 64. Let's give it a

626
02:28:29,989 --> 02:28:50,969
try. Yeah. I think I pretty sure. Yeah. I got this one. I had this one already. All right. Agent 64

627
02:28:50,969 --> 02:28:56,489
spies never die. Let's go for it. Agent one. Let's do options. Make sure there's no goddamn

628
02:28:56,489 --> 02:29:16,819
screen shake. We're good. Wait. I'll keep it on for now. I'll keep all this on for now. Okay.

629
02:29:17,379 --> 02:29:31,930
Let's give it a try. Story. Tower escape. Agent special agent or a 64 agent. Sims music. Let's

630
02:29:31,930 --> 02:29:39,799
just do agent, right? What about special agent? Free civilian hostages access ground floor.

631
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:58,920
I'll try special agent. This is agent 64. All right. Reminds me of time crisis. Action.

632
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:16,790
Man, why these games are all so good. It's like golden eye. Yep. It's golden eye, right? Yep. Yep.

633
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:37,719
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You play as count Dooku in this game. You don't. Should I go? Where

634
02:30:37,719 --> 02:30:44,180
should I go here? Elevators are locked. Press mouse to target and shoot the padlock. Yeah,

635
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:56,250
it is golden eye. Was that hostage? No, I was just trying to kick that guy in the face.

636
02:30:56,250 --> 02:31:16,329
That was not going to work. Got it. This is fun to play too. This feels great.

637
02:31:17,290 --> 02:31:46,950
Okay. So now where, where do I go from here? Is there a sprint? No, there's no sprint. It's

638
02:31:46,950 --> 02:32:38,069
golden eye over over here. That's a little dank. Stop shooting. Stop it. Even the switch to the

639
02:32:38,069 --> 02:32:55,190
decoder. Got it. Is there a crouch? It has to be right. This just is the facility from golden

640
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:59,110
eye. I remember because I used to replay this over and over again and I would just kind of hide

641
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:16,819
in the bathroom. How many guys treated the facility level or golden eye in general? Kind of like

642
02:33:17,459 --> 02:33:25,899
a hitman game. It was kind of one of the first iterations of there's AI and then be careful,

643
02:33:25,899 --> 02:33:44,120
hide from them. Oh God, I'm dead. Give me a different weapon quick. Why is everybody coming

644
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:52,680
out of the toilets with machine guns? Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Oh my God. I

645
02:33:52,680 --> 02:33:58,120
fucked it up. I fucked it up so bad. All right. Last try. Last try. Last try. I'm going to move on.

646
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:18,649
I get it now. I understand what the game is. Dude, why do I have this distinct memory of golden eye

647
02:34:18,649 --> 02:34:24,340
when you got to the end of the game and I remember unloading on that guy, the last boss,

648
02:34:24,340 --> 02:34:35,909
and you can't kill him, but he took like 700 million bullets. That happened, right? Wait,

649
02:34:35,909 --> 02:34:42,309
can't you kill that guy in a random place or something? And like the game kind of messes up

650
02:34:42,309 --> 02:34:47,180
and the game doesn't like understand that you beat it because you killed the boss way too early

651
02:34:47,180 --> 02:34:53,000
because you unloaded like a thousand bullets into his back or something. Why is this locked?

652
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:11,260
Did I not get the key card from somebody? I didn't have the tutorial to teach me how to play.

653
02:35:12,629 --> 02:35:16,469
I forgot. I got this. It was like an hour since I last played this part.

654
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:49,819
Nice dodge. Can I do that move? Why would the box explode? All right. I almost have a ton of ammo

655
02:35:49,819 --> 02:36:33,059
for this gun. I do. Here we go. I have a lot of bullets. Shut up. Ammo is so important. Okay.

656
02:36:33,059 --> 02:36:45,719
Let's get that open. All right. Now don't blow this like an idiot. All right. Let me try to do

657
02:36:45,719 --> 02:37:02,979
this stealthy so I don't get every single person in the whole room attacking me. Did that matter?

658
02:37:02,979 --> 02:37:48,729
All right. All right. I need to help back so bad or I'm going to lose. Is there any health in here?

659
02:37:48,729 --> 02:38:28,780
Come on, man. I'm going to die. I'm out of bullets. Abort mission immediately.

660
02:38:31,209 --> 02:38:36,170
No, I'm not leaving. I can still get the flash drive with all the coordinates on it. Where the

661
02:38:36,170 --> 02:39:04,250
hell it is? Got one. Immediately. Abort mission immediately. Excuse me. I'm not leaving until I

662
02:39:04,250 --> 02:39:17,639
get the... I'm going to beat the level. German, stop playing this like angry foot. I mean, I kind

663
02:39:17,639 --> 02:39:26,250
of have to. Please, I need it. It's important. Shoot a fire link habit. I need to know if a fire

664
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:33,209
link habit will explode if you shoot it. They do. There you go. What about the bureau? Yep. What

665
02:39:33,209 --> 02:39:39,450
about the table? Yep. Everything explodes when you shoot it enough times. Okay. That's actually

666
02:39:39,450 --> 02:40:09,500
pretty funny. How do I beat the level? I already failed. I can't progress anymore. This one was

667
02:40:09,500 --> 02:40:15,180
really good though. I like this. All right. So that was Agent 64. It seems like a really close

668
02:40:16,459 --> 02:40:22,219
retelling of a... Kind of like GoldenEye. I would say very much fun. Very fun game.

669
02:40:22,940 --> 02:40:31,639
What am I... Did my head explode? All right. That was a very fun game. I like that one a lot. I would

670
02:40:31,639 --> 02:40:39,110
give that one a four. I give that one a... I give that one a four out of five. All right. What else

671
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:46,680
can we do? Agency. That was really good. I really like that. Really fun. Let's take another look.

672
02:40:47,319 --> 02:40:58,809
Let's take a look at the page here. Okay. I mean, the one that's featured is Metal Hellsinger.

673
02:40:58,809 --> 02:41:06,840
Should I do that one? That one is featured right here on the front page here. What do you think?

674
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:23,860
Metal Hellslinger. Potion permit. Renown Metal Hellsinger. All right. I'll try it. This looks

675
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:36,459
pretty... This looks pretty cool. Is this a rhythm game? I don't know. Let's check it out. Would my

676
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:43,579
enjoyment and rating be better if it was offline? I don't think so. There are a lot of FPS games.

677
02:41:43,579 --> 02:41:52,780
There are more here that are not FPS. This game potion permit looks really cute. Midnight Fight

678
02:41:52,780 --> 02:42:02,729
Express. This looks kind of crazy. When am I going to get through all these? F. Yeah. The reason why

679
02:42:02,729 --> 02:42:08,010
you're seeing F is because I'm downloading a game. So it's a fake F. It's not a real F. Don't worry.

680
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:26,149
It ain't real. Okay. So that was... Is this game going to be loud? I would assume. Probably right.

681
02:42:26,149 --> 02:42:37,530
Potion permit next. Should you watch the streamer or watch Stranger Things? I mean, Stranger Things

682
02:42:37,530 --> 02:42:45,110
is going to be available pretty much at any point. Whenever you want. You can open up Netflix and

683
02:42:45,110 --> 02:42:54,059
watch Stranger Things anytime. I'm only here right now. I don't know. Stranger Things. Whatever. I

684
02:42:54,059 --> 02:43:05,260
mean, season two to three was... Was that right? You know, whatever. It's okay. But I mean, season

685
02:43:05,899 --> 02:43:16,620
four. We're getting to the end of the show and everything. It's all right. You haven't even

686
02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:27,530
watched it. Nope. I saw 10 minutes of the first episode. All right. This is a double headphone

687
02:43:27,530 --> 02:43:44,600
game, I think. Okay. I guess I'm going to accept the agreement. This looks good too. Video latency.

688
02:43:45,239 --> 02:43:50,920
This is a rhythm game. I thought you guys were full of shit. This is a rhythm game.

689
02:43:51,559 --> 02:44:12,459
The screen shake, right? Okay. It's fine. I definitely want to visit 90. Whatever. This is

690
02:44:12,459 --> 02:44:27,129
fine. Let's try demo. This is Metal Hellsinger demo. Okay. Metal Hellsinger is automatically

691
02:44:27,129 --> 02:44:33,899
configured to provide the best... That was really quickly speaking. Okay. If you're using wireless

692
02:44:33,899 --> 02:44:39,260
headphones or the devices with high latency, I'm not. I'm wired. So I think I should be fine.

693
02:44:43,450 --> 02:45:07,620
That sounded fake. Her coming to get me. I am. It's like a storm coming from far, far away.

694
02:45:08,420 --> 02:45:23,370
I did not feel it in the air. Then me. You didn't do that to the beat. Didn't count.

695
02:45:32,680 --> 02:45:56,860
Well, that's a wave. Let's get this shit out of me. That's still too high. That's still too high.

696
02:45:57,819 --> 02:46:09,000
Holy shit, dude. A two, three. Okay. We're going with three sensitivity.

697
02:46:09,319 --> 02:46:54,180
That's... I hated them. Is this a rhythm game? Okay. Okay. It has to be on beat. That wasn't on

698
02:46:54,180 --> 02:47:11,299
beat? No, wait. Hold on a minute. Go get, go get, go get, go. Go get, go get, go get. I'm trying to

699
02:47:11,299 --> 02:47:23,799
swing and hit when it lands. You know what I'm talking about? Because the sword will be landing

700
02:47:23,799 --> 02:48:18,569
on beat. Go get, go get, go get. Tap E. Slaughter gives you life. Nice. Go get, go get, go get.

701
02:48:23,030 --> 02:48:27,319
We didn't need words. We understood each other without them.

702
02:48:27,319 --> 02:48:37,239
Guess it sounds like love at first sight, don't it? You see, the whole universe has a rhythm. Well,

703
02:48:37,239 --> 02:48:47,979
it's... It's one, two, three, four. Not three, four, one, two, three, four. Sort of. This is

704
02:48:47,979 --> 02:49:07,770
her voice. All right. Let's get it. Paz can be used for keeping fury up even without demons around.

705
02:49:08,409 --> 02:51:17,430
Okay. Fury meter. We need perfect beats. Fury boost. Is this me singing? You can find all the

706
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:46,409
tutorial. Yeah. This is pretty... I like this one. This is cool. Mosh pit. Let's go. Enter hell.

707
02:51:46,409 --> 02:51:58,729
So are these... This is actual music, right? This is actual songs. All right. Let's get a real taste

708
02:51:58,729 --> 02:52:59,860
see if I like it. This is going to be a real test. Okay. I want to swing that fast. I get... All

709
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:06,899
right. Here's what I take. This kind of feels like doom if the doom guy got bored in the middle of

710
02:53:06,899 --> 02:54:01,940
the game and he's making his own fun. That's not a bad thing. So many souls here makes a kind of

711
02:54:01,940 --> 02:54:15,750
electricity. Music's really good too. Yeah. Every successful attack charges up weapons. Ultimate.

712
02:54:16,229 --> 02:54:52,440
Fire the ultimate. Oh shit. All right. All right. Where do I go now?

713
02:55:01,959 --> 02:57:39,159
This game is fucking phenomenal. Holy shit. 200k. How do I heal? Oh right. I know how to heal.

714
02:57:39,879 --> 02:59:07,850
I forgot to blink. You're right. Let's go. I already know, man. I'm already a professional.

715
02:59:08,649 --> 02:59:19,319
I only have to reload on the beat too. I just swallowed a bunch of spit. That was gross.

716
02:59:19,959 --> 02:59:35,059
All right. Where do I go? I'm so locked in just playing the game. I don't know. I don't know what

717
02:59:35,059 --> 02:59:53,450
direction I'm going. I'm going backwards. Where do I go? How did I turn around? I don't know.

718
02:59:53,450 --> 03:00:00,520
I've run through a door. Why am I going? I don't know. Am I going backwards? I don't know where

719
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:06,600
to go. What am I? Why are you drooling? I'm not drooling. What do you mean? I'm not drooling?

720
03:00:08,540 --> 03:00:11,659
Dude, you're really fucking up the flow. I'm sorry. Am I going the right way?

721
03:00:12,459 --> 03:00:19,079
There it is. I'll make it up for you. I'll make it up for you. I'll make it up.

722
03:01:06,389 --> 03:01:42,950
Oh, lightning. Mop shit. Yeah. That was an advanced technique. I wouldn't try that if I were you.

723
03:01:42,950 --> 03:02:26,379
Where do I go? Right? Where do I go from here? Offbeat.

724
03:02:47,879 --> 03:02:51,639
Okay. Now what? These games have been absolutely wonderful.

725
03:02:52,440 --> 03:02:55,899
How come? Why do I not find other with these games till last second?

726
03:02:57,290 --> 03:03:00,329
These have been really wonderful. This has been a wonderful experience.

727
03:03:04,979 --> 03:03:27,219
Four by four hogwash. Boss time. Well, there's your four by four hogwash. It ain't four by four,

728
03:03:27,219 --> 03:04:34,920
is it? I don't know who the boss is. Ow. Oh my God. Resurrect. Fuck.

729
03:05:03,739 --> 03:05:11,239
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That music changed. What? I'm so confused.

730
03:05:11,239 --> 03:06:55,590
Oh shit. No, don't kill me. There's stuff over here. Whoa, I'm good. No. What happened? I'm so

731
03:06:55,590 --> 03:07:01,610
confused. I don't know what just happened. Resurrect. Resurrect. It has a lot of stimulation.

732
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:29,450
It's a lot of stimulation. It's a ton of stimulation. Damn. That was crazy. That

733
03:07:29,450 --> 03:07:47,850
was so stimulating. That was very stimulating. Is that the end? There I am. Gas can.

734
03:07:52,379 --> 03:08:04,280
45,414. Why am I clicking up here like it's a menu? That's not bad. How many people are on earth?

735
03:08:12,760 --> 03:08:19,739
All right. I give this one a... All right. This is definitely a game that's absolutely... Okay.

736
03:08:20,459 --> 03:08:25,319
This game is going to be very hard because you know the music is going to change halfway through

737
03:08:25,319 --> 03:08:30,920
the game here and it's going to be unbelievably difficult to keep tempo and fire and dodge at the

738
03:08:30,920 --> 03:08:35,370
same time. So I'm going to give this demo. This was Metal Hellsinger.

739
03:08:42,950 --> 03:08:57,940
A 3.9. I'm going to give this a 3.9 out of 5. For the demo. For the demo. 3.9. It could have been

740
03:08:57,940 --> 03:09:03,139
like a... It could have been like a 4-6, but I feel like this game is going to be way too hard for me.

741
03:09:03,139 --> 03:09:07,299
I think this game is going to be very difficult for me. So I'm going to give it... That's not a

742
03:09:07,299 --> 03:09:20,059
low score. I think that's a pretty good score. You give Agent 64 a 4 out of 5. Oh shit. You're

743
03:09:20,059 --> 03:09:34,579
right. Okay. Flip them. Agent 64 is a 3... Hold on. Agent 64 3.6. No. 3.4. Hellsinger 3.9. That's

744
03:09:34,579 --> 03:09:44,940
better. That's better. Okay. Very cool. Let's check. What else can we do? Let's do another one.

745
03:09:48,420 --> 03:09:51,780
The three or four games we played today have... I mean, I wish I played more, obviously, but the

746
03:09:51,780 --> 03:09:56,229
stream had to start much later, which I'm glad that we're not having any internet problems.

747
03:09:56,229 --> 03:10:05,479
So I'm glad that's solved. That's low? No, it's not. A 3.9 is a solid like B, isn't it? Like a

748
03:10:05,479 --> 03:10:20,549
B+. Okay. We did all these three. Potion permit. Should we give this one a try? Midnight Fight

749
03:10:20,549 --> 03:10:29,690
Express. Roots of Pacha. Okay. I'm going to be honest. I'm going to scroll. I'm probably going

750
03:10:29,690 --> 03:10:37,940
to skip things that I don't think I'd be really interested in in the first place. There's Agent

751
03:10:37,940 --> 03:10:55,739
64. Goodbye World. Escape Academy. This one could be good. Frozen Flame. This could be good too.

752
03:10:55,739 --> 03:11:02,340
Any on this list that I don't want to skip. I don't know. This looks kind of... This looks

753
03:11:02,340 --> 03:11:13,930
cute though, doesn't it? How many are there? Hundreds. This game's a visual novel. Is this

754
03:11:13,930 --> 03:11:23,610
a visual novel game or is this a... Even it is. This is fun. I think I'm more into this one than

755
03:11:23,610 --> 03:11:28,520
this one just because I like... I don't know. I like kind of jumping around and shooting.

756
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:44,600
I'll try Midnight Fight Express. By the way, we're going to do this tomorrow and we're going to...

757
03:11:44,600 --> 03:11:49,799
This... I wanted just to come back and actually have a stream today, but tomorrow we're going to

758
03:11:49,799 --> 03:11:56,420
do this all day, so don't worry. We'll try to get to at least a few dozen of these, I think,

759
03:11:56,420 --> 03:12:01,350
over the course of the day tomorrow. All right. Midnight Fight Express. Is this a beat-em-up game?

760
03:12:01,350 --> 03:12:25,290
Is it controller? Let's give it a try. Now, you're going to see many F's when I download a game.

761
03:12:25,290 --> 03:12:36,840
Okay. We've seen a lot of... This game contains bright flashing lights warnings. Loading failed.

762
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:51,270
What? Oh. And there it is. And there it goes down to zero. Let's take this down to zero too.

763
03:12:53,270 --> 03:13:06,500
Thank goodness. These are all cracked out games. They kind of are.

764
03:13:07,219 --> 03:13:16,459
Blood settings. This is fine. All right. Let's go. That's fine. Don't matter. I think it's good.

765
03:13:16,459 --> 03:13:25,909
What default is good? Let's just go. We're going to do normal. Let's do it. I don't want my mom

766
03:13:25,909 --> 03:13:37,020
to see police turn the blood off. This game is made by one guy, by the way. It's a baby face,

767
03:13:37,020 --> 03:13:40,790
right? I'm going to call you that since our records don't show anything else. Kind of like

768
03:13:40,790 --> 03:13:44,709
you're a ghost. We don't like ghosts. They have a tendency to cause trouble and disappear. Classic

769
03:13:44,709 --> 03:13:49,770
ghost. Listen up, you claim innocence. No memory from before the attack began, so you were just

770
03:13:49,770 --> 03:13:55,670
trying to help. But am I? Do I have any clothes on? But we know that isn't true. You're part of

771
03:13:55,670 --> 03:14:00,309
this whole thing. The attack on the city, mobilizing the gangs, all of it. What we don't know is why.

772
03:14:00,309 --> 03:14:04,469
If we figure out the why, we can figure out the how, and then we can stop the how.

773
03:14:05,190 --> 03:14:09,479
Come on, buddy. Tell us the why. Help us save the city, and maybe you won't get the death penalty,

774
03:14:09,479 --> 03:14:14,629
maybe. Retrace your steps. Don't hold back or else we certainly won't. Now, what's this about

775
03:14:14,629 --> 03:14:46,920
a talking drone? Stop the how. Okay. Damn. Okay, cool. A is interact with objects. This chaos

776
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:57,610
sit in the city. There's criminals everywhere. Be careful. Take care of yourself. Let me out of

777
03:14:57,610 --> 03:15:07,350
here. Oh, it's the drone. Okay. Don't think I need to tell you. Beautiful city of tomorrow

778
03:15:07,350 --> 03:15:11,350
has gone to all sorts of hell. Could really use a little saving. Here's the deal. You're a sleeper

779
03:15:11,350 --> 03:15:16,069
agent, a brutal mercenary in a trance, waiting for a drone in shining armor like yours truly to wake

780
03:15:16,069 --> 03:15:21,450
you up from this little dream. I only ask you one itsy bitsy favor in turn. Help me save the city

781
03:15:21,450 --> 03:15:27,450
and all the good hearted schmucks in it before sun up or the crooks will get full control. Do that.

782
03:15:27,450 --> 03:15:35,879
You'll get your real life back in the city sees a brighter tomorrow after all. I know I paraphrase

783
03:15:35,879 --> 03:15:44,100
every thing a dot. Look, I know I'm unbearable. If there's dialogue in a game, you get two options.

784
03:15:44,739 --> 03:15:52,180
Let's love us. It won't be tomorrow. Okay, or they or a limitation about tomorrow. And I'll tell you

785
03:15:52,180 --> 03:15:57,139
we need to save this city. Yeah, I either go full on voice acting or I just paraphrase every sentence.

786
03:15:57,139 --> 03:16:01,500
And I'm sorry. That's just the way it is. I don't I don't like I don't read dialogue.

787
03:16:01,500 --> 03:16:07,590
Okay, I can't. Who am I fighting? Give us the second option. Fine.

788
03:16:09,110 --> 03:16:26,780
I mean, it's always just Mr. Satan talking. Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot. Gotta reactivate you.

789
03:16:26,780 --> 03:16:30,059
Applying a little noise cream should warm up those muscles right up.

790
03:16:35,159 --> 03:16:36,360
I have this music.

791
03:16:48,250 --> 03:17:25,030
It's a music game. And I got to do it to the beat. Beat him up. Rip bozo. All right. All right.

792
03:17:25,909 --> 03:17:38,569
Okay. Do I have I don't have rip bozo on this channel. Block. Oh, it's the Superman game stuff.

793
03:17:39,670 --> 03:17:49,590
On perfect blocks hit left bumper and then hit left bumper afterwards.

794
03:17:50,709 --> 03:18:13,979
Left bumper doesn't do anything. Heavy strike. Ah, I see. It has to be a perfect dodge.

795
03:18:14,780 --> 03:18:33,219
Oh, off the building. Wow. Why can I not get the that's not a perfect dodge. Hold on. Let me try

796
03:18:33,219 --> 03:18:56,309
to get this down. Swing at me. I'll get it. I can do rip bozo. Holy shit. You can't read.

797
03:18:57,270 --> 03:19:28,149
I know I'm doing a heavy strike right now. Hey, listen, bozo. It's fun. It's all right. It's fun.

798
03:19:37,829 --> 03:19:41,270
The rage meter builds up and when you get enraged, you do combat moves.

799
03:19:42,629 --> 03:20:03,909
I don't hate it. We're getting that idea. I don't hate it. Wait, they think I'm the pizza guy.

800
03:20:08,579 --> 03:20:29,190
Dude, pizza tonight. Pizza tonight. That's what I'm thinking. Is there like a dodge roll or anything?

801
03:20:29,190 --> 03:21:06,709
Okay, break their defense. Melee weapons. Yeah, it's just it's Batman. It's Batman. I could say

802
03:21:06,709 --> 03:21:09,110
you could get really good at this and it really string combos together and stuff.

803
03:21:09,750 --> 03:21:18,340
There's probably melee weapons. Oh, there is a dodge. Okay, now the game just got way better.

804
03:21:30,819 --> 03:21:36,120
Oh, I can pick that up. How do I pick it up? I want to pick up the weapon.

805
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:47,319
I definitely can pick it up as soon as I can. How do I pick that up?

806
03:21:47,879 --> 03:21:50,840
Right bumper. Oh, nice. All right. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

807
03:21:52,840 --> 03:22:06,700
Give me the bat. Don't come any closer or I'll slit this. You have a wrench in your hand?

808
03:22:12,219 --> 03:22:31,209
It's dangerous. Jesus. Okay. Focus. You can scan the environment. Interesting. Okay.

809
03:22:32,569 --> 03:22:57,909
This is fun. Photo mode. I got a good photo. All right. Whatever.

810
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:16,420
Really? What happened? What happened? Oh, I. Okay. You have to hold it.

811
03:23:23,510 --> 03:23:32,790
All right. This. Yeah, this is fun. They should not have let me do this because I'm not going to do

812
03:23:32,790 --> 03:24:04,219
anything else. Bozo's guns have this guns in the game too. What? Okay. This is this is a three eight.

813
03:24:04,860 --> 03:24:19,690
No, it's not. This is your hideout. These levels own unique items that you can lock by completing

814
03:24:19,690 --> 03:24:25,639
challenges. Challenge listed here after the level is unlocked. Learn more about the enemies

815
03:24:25,639 --> 03:24:35,420
you'll fight. Each level you can earn money, skills and upgrades, appearance, the playground,

816
03:24:35,420 --> 03:24:46,440
your progression tab. There's a lot here. I'm in trouble. I'm in. I'm going to be in trouble.

817
03:24:47,829 --> 03:24:59,270
I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Okay. I want to do throw stuff at people. Grapple enemies,

818
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:06,549
follow up chain strikes, parry and count. Oh, parry. This is okay. I thought this was way.

819
03:25:07,270 --> 03:25:11,049
I'm going to be honest with you. The first five minutes of this game. I was like, yeah, it's a two

820
03:25:12,729 --> 03:25:17,319
seeing all this. This just bumped up to just bumped up somewhere in the threes.

821
03:25:17,879 --> 03:25:39,110
Yeah. This was a two when I first started. Let's do grapple. Cool. Yeah. I want it. Okay. Assign it.

822
03:25:39,110 --> 03:25:50,629
Okay. Cool. The game needs screen shake. There is a screen check option in there. Actually,

823
03:25:50,629 --> 03:25:56,889
I want to make a point with this. I want to keep, I want you guys to keep tabs, keep track of the

824
03:25:56,889 --> 03:26:00,620
games we're playing tomorrow. We're going to do the same thing. Keep track of how many games have

825
03:26:00,620 --> 03:26:09,579
screen shake enabled in the options. This is an experiment. Turn it on. Sure. I'd like to,

826
03:26:09,579 --> 03:26:13,020
let's see what it's like with screen shake on. I'm sorry. I need to, we need to prove this point.

827
03:26:26,420 --> 03:26:42,819
Yeah. Like all, all screen shake does is just move the camera in closer and moving around and

828
03:26:42,819 --> 03:26:55,739
shaking around. How much worse is this game now that every time I swing, I go

829
03:27:02,219 --> 03:27:06,940
and this one, I will give credit to the dev here. This one's not as egregious as a lot of them really

830
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:16,040
are. I understand impact, right? But some of them, there's this lateral shake that some of them do.

831
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:20,899
So this one's going like this. So here's your screen, right? Here's your screen. This one's

832
03:27:20,899 --> 03:27:33,459
going like this, like that. A lot of these fucking stupid ass games go like this. That's the one I'm

833
03:27:33,459 --> 03:27:43,500
talking about. Not the one that goes like this. The one that goes, oh, I hate that trend so much.

834
03:27:43,500 --> 03:27:54,729
I quit video games if it stays, but have you noticed you see what's going on here? Take a look.

835
03:27:55,290 --> 03:28:15,260
Have you puked yet? Don't quit. You're so dramatic. I'm kidding. I'm not going to quit

836
03:28:15,260 --> 03:28:19,739
video games because some games have a screen shake enabled, but I will complain about it.

837
03:28:20,299 --> 03:28:58,940
Like a whiny little baby. Gold? Honey grab? What's a grab move? I don't really like the

838
03:28:58,940 --> 03:29:12,219
impact shake. No, and everyone's putting it in every game. Bulky bozos? What the fuck, dude?

839
03:29:12,219 --> 03:29:51,700
Batman didn't kill people. Didn't even get to do the tutorial with that guy. Okay. Shit, I keep

840
03:29:51,700 --> 03:30:21,299
missing it. Hold on. Ready? Swing. Turn the screen shake off. It's making my stomach hurt.

841
03:30:21,299 --> 03:30:37,899
It's making your stomach hurt. It's fucking with me too. Yeah. Who is responsible for this being

842
03:30:37,899 --> 03:30:55,819
in every game? All right. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a 3.4. Pretty damn good. Pretty good. It's

843
03:30:55,819 --> 03:31:04,860
a 3.4. That's a 3.4. Next one. That was Midnight Fight Express, and that was a good one. That was

844
03:31:04,860 --> 03:31:11,299
a 3.4. Solid. I think that with a little bit more time in it, I'd probably make that score a little

845
03:31:11,299 --> 03:31:21,510
higher. 3.4 is not a passing grade, is it? What are you talking about? Because it is. How is that

846
03:31:21,510 --> 03:31:30,459
not a passing grade? That's like a good score. Okay. Anything on this first drop down here that

847
03:31:30,459 --> 03:31:38,409
I don't want to skip? I'm telling you, potion permit is looking kind of pog to me. I think I

848
03:31:38,409 --> 03:31:47,500
want to do it. It's looking pretty good to me. One dev project. Okay. A one dev project makes that

849
03:31:47,500 --> 03:31:54,489
way better. That's actually insane. That's remarkable. That's one person. I'm doing potion

850
03:31:54,489 --> 03:32:05,670
permit. I'm going for it. That's actually a crowning achievement for one person to do that.

851
03:32:05,670 --> 03:32:13,930
I just think I need a little bit more time in it. You know what I'm saying? Okay. Let's do it.

852
03:32:13,930 --> 03:32:20,090
Potion, uh, potion power or whatever the game's called. I don't remember.

853
03:32:20,090 --> 03:32:25,399
Potion permit. I'm thinking this is going to be a mid- this is going to be a mid-four.

854
03:32:25,399 --> 03:32:42,870
Get it over with already. What? This looks like a potential mid-4.2 game. Look at how cute this is.

855
03:32:42,870 --> 03:32:52,709
Hold on. I'm going to turn it up. Guys, not every game has to have people getting punched in the

856
03:32:52,709 --> 03:32:57,350
face until their brains explode. You can do a potion game, okay? Listen to the music.

857
03:32:57,989 --> 03:33:13,579
Listen to the music. Attack, inventory, roll. Four buttons. Perfect for me. Resolution, 720p.

858
03:33:14,459 --> 03:33:45,159
Change that real quick. Let's go. Potion permit. Let's do it. Let's go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, okay.

859
03:33:46,540 --> 03:34:01,909
Uh, okay. Green. Okay. And okay. And okay. And okay. This game has screen shake? No, it definitely

860
03:34:01,909 --> 03:34:30,090
doesn't. What a bad- worst fit I've ever seen. It was fine. Ah, excuse me. Logan, it's me, Dr. Nester

861
03:34:30,090 --> 03:34:38,600
from the Medical Association. Yes. I'm on my way to meet our colleagues on Moonbury Island.

862
03:34:39,319 --> 03:34:45,370
The Association HQ asked me to say hello to you since we're taking the same train.

863
03:34:48,459 --> 03:34:55,770
Oh my, I didn't realize you were bringing your dog along. Isn't he adorable? What's his name?

864
03:35:01,770 --> 03:35:08,920
I don't care. It's a demo. Such an adorable name. Are you going to help out on Logan's important

865
03:35:08,920 --> 03:35:20,760
assignment? No, zero, zero, zero. We're almost at Moonbury's station. While you're on the island,

866
03:35:20,760 --> 03:35:29,780
you'll be representing the Medical Association. You have everything in order. This is a valuable

867
03:35:29,780 --> 03:35:36,440
opportunity for us. We're all counting on you. If you're successful, we may finally be allowed

868
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:44,139
to establish a branch on the island. Camera shake. That's- we're in a train. I'm not swinging

869
03:35:44,139 --> 03:35:48,940
a sword and my whole head is shaking. We're on a train. It makes sense. It's fine when you're on a

870
03:35:48,940 --> 03:35:56,170
goddamn moving vehicle. Okay, let's go. There's no screen shake. There's no screen- a camera shake

871
03:35:56,170 --> 03:36:10,010
is- I'm talking about impact screen shake when you swing a weapon or shoot somebody. This is it.

872
03:36:10,010 --> 03:36:19,989
Logan, Moonbury Island. God, hurry up already. I just want to play the demo. I don't care shit

873
03:36:19,989 --> 03:36:36,840
about any of these people. Logan, we've been expecting you. Oh yes, allow me to welcome you

874
03:36:36,840 --> 03:36:50,659
to Moonbury. My name is Meyer. I'm the mayor. This is my wife, Marielle. Didn't I just skip-

875
03:36:50,659 --> 03:37:04,340
didn't I hold the skip button? It's a two. I'm just- we're missing such important shit here.

876
03:37:05,719 --> 03:37:09,159
Good evening, everyone. We've come together tonight to welcome a guest.

877
03:37:11,260 --> 03:37:20,409
Please allow me to introduce Logan. Logan is a chemist sent by the Medical Association.

878
03:37:21,690 --> 03:37:28,340
As you are all aware, our daughter has been sick for a long time. My wife and I are still trying

879
03:37:28,340 --> 03:37:40,649
to find a cure for her illness. The people are shaking. Stop it. With that in mind, we have sought

880
03:37:40,649 --> 03:37:49,049
assistance from the capital. I hope you all give Logan a warm welcome. A chemist, I see. Never

881
03:37:49,209 --> 03:37:54,170
thought I'd see another chemist in our town. We know you're desperate for a cure, but we-

882
03:37:54,889 --> 03:38:00,010
you want to watch who you bring in, Meyer. That person's upset. A chemist? Well,

883
03:38:00,010 --> 03:38:05,670
shiver me timbers. I've crewmates more competent than this novice. How do you know that already?

884
03:38:07,670 --> 03:38:11,829
Concerned. Nobody from the capital can be trusted. Have you forgotten what they did?

885
03:38:12,870 --> 03:38:16,950
Concerned. Oh, thinking. Concerned. Sad. Thinking. Reserved.

886
03:38:17,510 --> 03:38:25,799
Now, now. Won't anyone make a newcomer feel welcome? Please forgive us. Everyone is just a

887
03:38:25,799 --> 03:38:35,540
little excited. Now, if you'd like to follow me, I'll show you to your lodgings. This game's probably

888
03:38:35,540 --> 03:38:42,229
like a four. Just wait till we get to the menu. The crafting menu. This old building used to be

889
03:38:42,229 --> 03:38:53,430
our previous chemist's house. Its former owner moved away a long time ago. Now that it's empty,

890
03:38:53,430 --> 03:39:01,819
you can take it over. I realize it might seem rather odd to you that not everyone here is

891
03:39:01,899 --> 03:39:06,569
overjoyed about. Yeah, what's going on with that? We've rather a history of incidents involving the

892
03:39:06,569 --> 03:39:14,280
medical association. Our relationship has been rather disastrous so far. I imagine they haven't

893
03:39:14,280 --> 03:39:20,309
told you a single word about all this in the capital. This is cute. I like this. You'll learn

894
03:39:20,309 --> 03:39:24,870
more about it as you discover the island. Let's come back to all this after you've rested, shall

895
03:39:24,870 --> 03:39:32,860
we? And please don't forget our request. Our daughter needs your help. I'll see you tomorrow,

896
03:39:32,860 --> 03:39:42,360
Logan. Good night, sleep well. Dude, what the fuck? Where's the instantaneous dopamine?

897
03:39:46,729 --> 03:40:00,979
You can move your character around freely while you're running. Your dog will follow you wherever

898
03:40:00,979 --> 03:40:06,870
you go. Sadly, he's not allowed to come inside the house. Why not interact with obstacles around you?

899
03:40:06,870 --> 03:40:19,100
You'll see a sign. I got a health bar. Okay, that was a pretty sick Minecraft sounds. Okay,

900
03:40:19,819 --> 03:40:37,139
you can decorate your room. This game's so cute. It is so cute. Cool. You can acquire more furniture

901
03:40:37,139 --> 03:40:51,059
by purchasing them from the bulk and bill. The music is really good too. Very good. Try answer.

902
03:40:51,940 --> 03:41:09,340
Oh my god, this place is, look at this. It's a dodge roll. Huh? Good morning. I trust you slept

903
03:41:09,340 --> 03:41:19,270
well. Excellent. Allow me to introduce Zhao, my assistant. This is Zhao. Very nice to meet you.

904
03:41:21,260 --> 03:41:29,129
I work with Mayor Meyer at the town hall. I was hoping the two of you would get along. If there's

905
03:41:29,129 --> 03:41:34,549
anything you need, Zhao will be able to assist you. As it is your first day, I'd like you to

906
03:41:34,549 --> 03:41:39,020
get started and know our island. I've asked one of our rangers to meet you near Meadow

907
03:41:39,020 --> 03:41:51,290
Range and show you the ropes to get there. The music, listen to this. This is wonderful. Okay.

908
03:41:56,020 --> 03:42:04,020
Okay. Yeah, this is comfy. I like this. This is comfy.

909
03:42:05,459 --> 03:42:09,670
Highlighted quest. Go to the Meadow Range entrance. Mini map at the top right of the screen

910
03:42:09,670 --> 03:42:17,270
shows quest objectives as icons. You can apply chapstick liberally to your lips because you need

911
03:42:17,270 --> 03:42:32,229
it so bad and it's not here. Nevermind. Okay. Go to the Meadow Range entrance. I mean, the art is

912
03:42:32,229 --> 03:42:39,829
beautiful. Music's really fantastic. Art is beautiful. Looks really nice. It's pretty clean.

913
03:42:40,549 --> 03:42:45,110
Very readable. All the font. I can see everything. Quest markers help.

914
03:42:45,110 --> 03:43:08,459
There's a dog. That's a big plus. You're right. I have a phone map too. Oh, okay. Look at this

915
03:43:08,459 --> 03:43:31,659
little town. Pet the dog. I don't think you can pet the dog. Maybe you can. Wait, this way. I like

916
03:43:31,659 --> 03:43:52,899
the cape. Uh oh. Hey there. You must be the chemist. My name's Forrest. Mayor Meyer said you'd be coming

917
03:43:52,899 --> 03:44:01,899
this way. I've got a little something for you. Call it a welcome gift. You might need it because

918
03:44:01,899 --> 03:44:07,579
I've got an errand for you. Here we go. I want you to gather some herbs. I'm sure you know how,

919
03:44:07,579 --> 03:44:18,809
right? Probably. An accident in the past killed off many of our native plants. If only people from

920
03:44:18,809 --> 03:44:27,850
capital worked responsibly, tragedies like that wouldn't happen. That's not good. Oops, me in my

921
03:44:27,850 --> 03:44:32,739
big mouth. Once you're done, head back to my cottage. I'll see you there. All right. So go get herbs?

922
03:44:40,899 --> 03:44:46,379
That's all. All right. Good luck. Swing your tools at gathering points to forge resources.

923
03:44:46,379 --> 03:44:50,780
Gathering points are indicated. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stamina is consumed. You can switch tools.

924
03:44:52,600 --> 03:45:00,700
Sickle, hammer, and axe. Dodge rolling. Does not consume stamina. Whoa.

925
03:45:03,450 --> 03:45:25,559
Hell yeah. What did you give it a two? Wrong. Wrong. Oh shit, they're alive.

926
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:47,719
There ain't screen shake stuff. There is no screen shake. Stop it.

927
03:45:47,719 --> 03:46:10,280
Get basil, get daisy. Okay. Sticky gel. How do I feed the dog? Dog interaction.

928
03:46:11,700 --> 03:46:24,629
Ah, okay. Your dog loves food and loves to be petted. You can do this. All right, that's cute.

929
03:46:25,270 --> 03:46:37,020
I wanted to... Wait, I wanted to open the dog menu. Apple juice? Why would you... I wouldn't

930
03:46:37,020 --> 03:46:54,920
feed my dog apple juice. But okay. This is probably going to be one of those really comfy

931
03:46:54,920 --> 03:47:04,659
star do-like games, isn't it? Just load it up, burn like eight hours in here, just collecting goo.

932
03:47:10,420 --> 03:47:13,290
Oh shit. I gotta upgrade the tools.

933
03:47:15,290 --> 03:47:41,000
I can't... I don't think I can turn it off. But it's only... It's only on certain actions though.

934
03:47:44,010 --> 03:48:07,129
Did I get stumped too? Where are these things I'm supposed to be getting?

935
03:48:07,770 --> 03:48:37,540
Where's the jasmine and the basil? It says it's supposed to be over here. Enemy? Spores.

936
03:48:37,540 --> 03:48:46,309
I need basil. All right. I got... I got plenty of rocks. I need basil and jasmine.

937
03:48:46,870 --> 03:49:09,219
Now. Am I going too far away? Is this... What is this? Jasmine. Yep. Got it.

938
03:49:11,620 --> 03:49:31,610
I like it. I like it. Now I just need basil. What the fuck is that?

939
03:49:33,239 --> 03:50:00,920
That's not a cute thing. That's a scary monster. Oh, this one's got moss on it.

940
03:50:00,920 --> 03:50:20,389
I think it's worth more. It's more valuable. Honey? No, copper nugget. Okay. I need three...

941
03:50:20,389 --> 03:50:40,040
I'm not... I'm gonna do this task. Here, have some apple juice. All right. I'm ready to give

942
03:50:40,040 --> 03:50:53,860
my demo assessment. You ready? Demo assessment. Here it is. You ready for this? I think this is

943
03:50:53,860 --> 03:50:57,940
going to be a game you spend a lot of time in. I feel like it's going to be really fun. I feel

944
03:50:57,940 --> 03:51:05,139
like it's very engaging. Tons of characters to care about. We got a day-night cycle. It's got a

945
03:51:05,139 --> 03:51:14,520
dodge roll. There's a lot to do, it looks like. There's a big town. There's a boat, which means

946
03:51:14,520 --> 03:51:27,030
it's probably another town. I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna be ballsy with this one. I think this

947
03:51:27,030 --> 03:51:47,350
is gonna be a... I think this is... I'm gonna be ballsy with this thing. 3.6. That's very safe.

948
03:51:47,350 --> 03:51:53,239
That's not ballsy. That's very safe. I don't know. Okay. It's hard to give an assessment on this

949
03:51:53,239 --> 03:51:57,079
demo because it's a demo of a game that probably has like a hundred plus hours of content in it.

950
03:51:57,879 --> 03:52:11,979
I'll tell you, from what's here, I think this is very, very nice. Southeast of the plants.

951
03:52:12,709 --> 03:52:18,950
What's... Oh, you didn't even see that. I got... I just got like a secret treasure map.

952
03:52:27,190 --> 03:52:49,030
Southeast, where... A lot of bears. Oh, there it is. Oh, God. You're only rating the demos? Oh,

953
03:52:49,030 --> 03:52:56,420
that's right. Okay, sorry. All right. The game's probably gonna be really fun, but I think the

954
03:52:56,420 --> 03:53:11,940
demo is... But how do you make a demo with a game this big? Basil is true north right now. I just

955
03:53:11,940 --> 03:53:20,809
got one right there. This with the... Okay, let me paint you a picture here. This with a cup of coffee.

956
03:53:21,370 --> 03:53:27,270
Just shut up. Listen to the music. Imagine you've got in your hand. You're at your computer,

957
03:53:27,270 --> 03:53:32,090
you're at your desk, you're in your room, whatever. Listen to the music. You got a hot coffee. A coffee

958
03:53:32,090 --> 03:53:36,729
is right here and it's burning hot. I mean, you're just gonna... You're gonna hold it here and you're

959
03:53:36,729 --> 03:53:42,010
just gonna smell it. You're not gonna take a sip. Then you're gonna put it down and you're gonna do

960
03:53:42,010 --> 03:53:50,540
that like five or six more times until you take one sip. That's this kind of game. What's wrong?

961
03:53:51,180 --> 03:54:06,860
What's wrong with me? Did I not even complete the mission? Am I too tired? Stamina, right? Yeah,

962
03:54:06,860 --> 03:54:17,190
okay. Can I fail? Yeah, this is a brew a hot cup of coffee and sit here and smell the coffee while

963
03:54:17,190 --> 03:54:26,680
you play and then take a sip every now and then. Like, I would just sit here and just do that,

964
03:54:26,680 --> 03:54:48,200
like this, and then cast a fishing line. Lots of fails, lots of triumphs. No, we want to drink

965
03:54:48,200 --> 03:54:54,360
Mountain Dew. No, drink... Just have like a nice just cup of coffee and I like... Coffee needs to

966
03:54:54,360 --> 03:55:09,129
be just raw. It's got to be... I just... I like black coffee. I'm getting lost in the woods here.

967
03:55:15,209 --> 03:55:22,040
You get a nice hot cup of black coffee. Oh my goodness. This game's score went up because I

968
03:55:22,040 --> 03:55:32,219
thought about doing that without a doubt. This sound and this bridge, I can smell the coffee

969
03:55:32,219 --> 03:55:43,739
beans and it's gonna make it a 3-5. All right, next. I failed the tutorial mission. Do you remember

970
03:55:43,739 --> 03:55:48,780
you're the worst reviewer? I can't review this game. I can't even review the demo.

971
03:55:50,709 --> 03:55:56,629
It's a huge game. It's very cute. The soundtrack is really, really wonderful. I like the art style.

972
03:55:56,629 --> 03:56:00,950
I think the characters are really interesting. I think the coffee smell is gonna be up there,

973
03:56:00,950 --> 03:56:13,370
so I'm gonna give it a 3.5. I think the demo is a solid 3.5 out of 5. I think that's good.

974
03:56:14,899 --> 03:56:18,899
Let's do... You know what? Let's do, what, one or two more? I don't want to go too late. I just

975
03:56:18,899 --> 03:56:25,209
want to make sure I stream today. It was 3.6? Yeah, that's what it was. 3.7. That's what the

976
03:56:25,209 --> 03:56:29,930
final score is. No, it's not. 3.6. That's good. Rating demos is like the dumbest thing you could

977
03:56:29,930 --> 03:56:42,360
possibly do. I can't think of anything stupider than rating a demo. What about this game? What

978
03:56:42,360 --> 03:56:55,260
about this one? What do you think? Frozen? Escape Academy? Frozen Flame? This one looks okay.

979
03:56:57,860 --> 03:57:09,530
Terra Invicta? No. No, this looks way too... I don't play games like this. This is like space

980
03:57:09,530 --> 03:57:25,049
management simulator. Nope. Neaied? This looks kind of cool. Signals. This one apparently is

981
03:57:25,049 --> 03:57:38,329
violent. Kind of interested. We already saw this one, which was very nice. The Cultivation card

982
03:57:38,329 --> 03:57:57,700
game? Card game? Card games can be fun. Gloomwood? This is the... Oh, man. All right, we're saving

983
03:57:57,700 --> 03:58:03,940
this. Are we saving this one for tomorrow? Should I do this right now? Dude, this game's gonna be

984
03:58:03,940 --> 03:58:13,159
insane. Should we do it right now or save it for tomorrow? I want to anticipate that one for one

985
03:58:13,159 --> 03:58:17,719
more day. Yeah, we'll do it tomorrow. Oh my god, I'm so glad there's a demo for this game. I was so

986
03:58:17,719 --> 03:58:32,440
interested. I'm very curious about it. Ripout? Let's try this one. Let's go. Ripout. There's

987
03:58:32,440 --> 03:58:52,659
20 gigs for the demo? Holy shit. It's a violence game? Save this one for tomorrow? Um, you think

988
03:58:52,659 --> 03:59:08,920
so? Okay, well let's keep looking. Moonscars? Oh, it's kind of a 2D game. I kind of want to

989
03:59:08,920 --> 03:59:20,250
try this. Okay, I'm gonna download Moonscars. Domekeeper? Time management? Action roguelike?

990
03:59:24,440 --> 03:59:35,129
No, no, guys, guys. It's not, it's not, um, it's me downloading the game. No, no, we're good. We're

991
03:59:35,129 --> 03:59:41,750
good. It's okay. I'm downloading a 20 gig game. That's why it's doing this. We'll be okay. Don't

992
03:59:41,750 --> 04:00:00,059
worry. It's done in like two seconds. Trapang 2? No, we're good. We're good. Limit the download? No,

993
04:00:00,059 --> 04:00:08,309
I want it instantly. It's done. Trapang 2? I kind of want to, I want to try Moonscars right now.

994
04:00:08,309 --> 04:00:34,149
That's what we're doing right now. Let's do it. Oh, I gotta exit this game. Okay. Don't just go

995
04:00:34,149 --> 04:00:41,579
through the popular ones. Explore the subcategories. I know I will. I will. There's a lot to go through,

996
04:00:41,579 --> 04:00:45,100
so don't worry. I'm not just gonna burn through this. Just the popular ones. We'll go category

997
04:00:45,100 --> 04:00:55,510
by category. All right, let's open it up. See how this one is. What the, what the hell did I just

998
04:00:55,510 --> 04:01:06,420
download? What's the game called? What did I, what did I, what did I just download? Moonscars. Okay,

999
04:01:06,420 --> 04:01:22,920
yep. Let's do it. Another humble game. I'm imagining this is probably a controller,

1000
04:01:23,479 --> 04:01:31,000
which it seems like it is. All right. Oh, it's 640 by 480. What are you on about here?

1001
04:01:31,639 --> 04:01:53,079
I'm gonna turn it down. Keep it at 480p. That's a weird default. My goodness. Oh, my god.

1002
04:01:53,959 --> 04:02:02,659
99 hertz? That's not accurate. That's, isn't that kind of, that's gonna be weird.

1003
04:02:06,069 --> 04:02:18,340
Just play at 23 hertz? Wait, why, why would you do that? You're out of sync? What? Oh, you gotta

1004
04:02:18,340 --> 04:02:26,549
refresh. You gotta refresh. Sometimes the, with Twitch. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm just gonna,

1005
04:02:26,549 --> 04:02:42,260
I'm not doing 23 hertz. Does that work? You're not in sync? Yeah, you gotta refresh. What just

1006
04:02:42,260 --> 04:02:56,920
happened? What's going on? What happened? Oh, there you go. Let's do it. Things double as you, as you,

1007
04:02:57,479 --> 04:03:24,840
never come to per on my knees these days. This is, I like the painting. The game makes you really

1008
04:03:24,840 --> 04:03:31,110
think about if you want to skip the cutscene. I felt bad halfway through, so I stopped skipping it.

1009
04:03:31,110 --> 04:04:24,170
Oh, it's a cat. I thought there was a person sitting on the bench next to him. Already gets

1010
04:04:24,170 --> 04:04:33,700
a bunch of points. I'll explain. Do you guys remember the game called Out of This World

1011
04:04:33,700 --> 04:04:38,540
for Another World? I'm getting serious Another World vibes, which is a big plus.

1012
04:04:38,780 --> 04:05:31,530
Healing. Icarus is a soul liquid, the very essence of human life. Use it collected to heal your wounds.

1013
04:05:31,530 --> 04:05:50,950
You can't let it go. I can't let it go. I'm telling you, I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. It's in every

1014
04:05:50,950 --> 04:05:58,309
single game now. I don't, it just is. What resolution is this? What are you talking about?

1015
04:05:58,309 --> 04:06:21,319
Why is it 640x480? Why is it 640x480? I don't think it is. That's bullshit. It was, I don't care.

1016
04:06:21,319 --> 04:06:40,659
It was, I don't care. Ooh, witchery. This game looks unbelievably fun. Hold on. Let me get over

1017
04:06:40,659 --> 04:06:54,299
it. Yeah, it was already was the highest resolution. I think it's just doing that for some reason.

1018
04:06:54,299 --> 04:07:14,680
All right, so I have witchery. God damn it. I'm so mad. So I have witchery now of direct blast

1019
04:07:14,680 --> 04:07:33,379
forward. How do I do? Ooh, that's cool. Can you open the door? This door opens from the other side.

1020
04:07:34,659 --> 04:08:16,780
How do I get up there? Oh, okay. It's major screen shake. How do I open this? Go left? Oh,

1021
04:08:16,780 --> 04:08:40,149
okay. I wasted my stuff. How do I get that back? Witchery spoils ichor. Irma can purge spoiled

1022
04:08:40,149 --> 04:08:43,350
ichor hitting foes with her sword. Spoiled ichor can still be used for healing. Okay.

1023
04:08:44,309 --> 04:09:04,979
I mean, it plays beautifully. It's, I mean, it plays wonderfully. It's smooth. The animations

1024
04:09:04,979 --> 04:09:15,620
are great. The art style, it looks, the art style looks really nice. This is really, it's,

1025
04:09:15,620 --> 04:09:30,760
it's beautiful. I'm very, boss fights in this game, I imagine will be the big selling point.

1026
04:09:31,319 --> 04:09:56,500
Cool. Bone powder. 250 bone powder. Climb the ledge. Oh, I'm in here now. Cool. Kind of like

1027
04:09:56,500 --> 04:10:16,200
Castlevania. Kind of like, kind of like, what's the other game I'm thinking of? Symphony of the Night.

1028
04:10:16,200 --> 04:10:48,329
Yep. That's what I'm thinking of. Nice. It's fun. Am I dead? That's a good one. That's good.

1029
04:10:48,329 --> 04:10:52,620
It's fun. I actually want you to look at this though. This is important before I turn this up.

1030
04:10:55,290 --> 04:11:05,639
There's a lot of moons. There's a lot of moves here. Look at all this. Corpse reassembly. There's

1031
04:11:05,639 --> 04:11:15,270
an entire skill tree. Skill trees are a huge plus. There's a dev in the chat. This game's cool.

1032
04:11:18,790 --> 04:11:29,270
Dev in chat. Rant about the screen shake real quick. No, I can't. I can't do that. I have stage

1033
04:11:29,270 --> 04:11:56,059
fright. Stage fright. I'm like, let me try one more time. That felt amazing. I'm telling you,

1034
04:11:56,059 --> 04:12:00,120
this game is fun. When this comes out, there's going to be people that are playing the hell out

1035
04:12:00,120 --> 04:12:03,799
of this. They're going to think it's like an incredible game. It's going to be really difficult.

1036
04:12:03,799 --> 04:12:08,040
It's going to be hard. The boss is going to be hard. The game is really, really about skill-based

1037
04:12:08,040 --> 04:12:16,680
dodging and stuff. And it plays beautifully. Can you put a thing in where I can take the screen

1038
04:12:16,680 --> 04:12:20,840
shake off the screen, please? Can I? I'm just, I'm asking like, like nicely. I don't want to be

1039
04:12:20,840 --> 04:12:26,899
like a weirdo about this. Guys, if we're going to do this, every dev that, if every dev comes

1040
04:12:26,899 --> 04:12:35,319
into the stream and every game has screen shake, I'm going to look like a real dickhead. These games

1041
04:12:35,319 --> 04:12:44,780
are great. This is, this game is, I'm telling you, this game's fun. And look, I might be the weird

1042
04:12:44,780 --> 04:12:49,819
one. You could probably poll a hundred people, family feud style, and ask them, hey, do you give

1043
04:12:49,819 --> 04:12:55,500
a shit if there's screen shake on every hit? And if 99 of them say, no, I don't care at all.

1044
04:12:56,459 --> 04:13:16,790
And I'm the weird guy that I get it. Shortcut, heal. Oh, that's right. I have to heal. And it,

1045
04:13:16,790 --> 04:13:25,100
oh, that actually, that's a pretty cool mechanic. It uses that. Cool. Shortcut. Ah, all right. Cool.

1046
04:13:27,530 --> 04:13:30,889
Bone, found a grave, bone powder. Imagine that's probably how you level up.

1047
04:13:31,989 --> 04:13:53,379
If you level up, airdrop. Ooh, cool. Spite level achieved. Ooh, wait, there's bone powder.

1048
04:13:54,020 --> 04:14:01,670
I never really thought about it. I know. And the thing is, I, it could have, this could have,

1049
04:14:01,670 --> 04:14:07,700
okay, don't, I'm going to die. What are you doing? I feel like I'm just noticing it way more.

1050
04:14:11,979 --> 04:14:16,379
And I am not speaking out of malice. I'm not speaking out of, oh my God, all these games

1051
04:14:16,379 --> 04:14:22,219
stink. I'm speaking out of my actual physical wellbeing. It makes me actually nauseous.

1052
04:14:26,819 --> 04:14:30,020
I'm not speaking out of malice. I promise you. It just makes me nauseous.

1053
04:14:30,979 --> 04:14:53,739
Constantly shake so you can counteract screen shake. Are you getting nauseous right now?

1054
04:14:55,420 --> 04:15:03,500
I mean, this, this one, I'll tell you, this one is not as bad as some 3D games. It's a lot more

1055
04:15:03,500 --> 04:15:08,540
painful for me to look at. I mean, it's still here and I still, I don't love it. I don't like

1056
04:15:08,540 --> 04:15:26,340
it really at all. But 2D versus a 3D visual with screen shake, it kind of hurts even more. You just

1057
04:15:26,340 --> 04:15:42,889
played a heavy metal rhythm shooter. Yeah, but listen, listen, it's, it, you know what I'm saying?

1058
04:15:57,829 --> 04:16:13,459
R, B, oh, there's actually a parry. Cool. Let me try parry. That was cool. All right. I like that

1059
04:16:14,100 --> 04:16:20,149
spike menu. Let's check it out. Instant heal, build up effect, critical. Oh, critical. Definitely.

1060
04:16:24,020 --> 04:16:28,459
Spell cost. What about instant heal? I feel like that's a good one.

1061
04:16:29,420 --> 04:16:42,540
I, wait, you doing a poll right now for screen shake? How did only 500 people vote in that poll?

1062
04:16:42,540 --> 04:16:49,979
There's 10,000 people here. Oh my God. So many of you do not give a shit about this at all.

1063
04:16:50,620 --> 04:16:55,739
You don't care to even participate in the poll. You just don't even care. That's so funny.

1064
04:16:57,420 --> 04:17:04,299
That's hilarious. A majority of you do not care at all. Have you been rolling your eyes the whole

1065
04:17:04,299 --> 04:17:21,850
time? You just don't care. How many people voted on? How many people said to put it on? Not even

1066
04:17:21,850 --> 04:17:32,819
a, like a 5% voting turnout. Oh my goodness. And somebody actually said, I don't even fucking care.

1067
04:17:32,819 --> 04:17:40,360
Laughing my ass off. Somebody said, I didn't even know there was a poll. You're not even watching my

1068
04:17:40,360 --> 04:17:53,610
stream. You're not even watching the stream. God, I love this. I have so much fun. It's too fun.

1069
04:17:53,610 --> 04:18:00,299
That's too fun to stream. It really is. Boss fight. I'm gonna do wicked messy hair for the

1070
04:18:00,299 --> 04:18:09,000
rest of the day. Okay. This moon forsaken place serves as a shelter to as creatures gray ermine

1071
04:18:09,000 --> 04:18:25,670
meats. Oh, kind of like a hub world. Cool. Zoran, is that you? What happened to me, Zoran? I've been

1072
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:30,219
on the quest head and eye. Did something happen between us? My guts ache like I've been put in a

1073
04:18:30,219 --> 04:18:38,620
grinder. You're meowing too loudly, kitten. It's not Zoran. It won't respond. Ah, cleft husk has the

1074
04:18:38,620 --> 04:18:43,979
same grim face as Zoran himself. You poor, poor kitten. I'm a cat? It may be still one of us. This

1075
04:18:43,979 --> 04:18:48,729
husk can shape fine clay vessels for you. These strong bodies will help you slip from the clutches

1076
04:18:48,729 --> 04:18:54,200
of pain, yet only for so long. Get a chance to heal your wounds, gray kitten. Just, I'm a cat.

1077
04:18:54,840 --> 04:19:16,010
There you go. What is this? The cat is right. I lost a lot of ichor. I can't fight in full force

1078
04:19:16,010 --> 04:19:26,360
with that gland shattered like that. I need to cast a mold. New poll? No, you didn't participate

1079
04:19:26,360 --> 04:19:47,079
in the first one. Look at how cool that looks. I love the animation. I love the art style.

1080
04:19:47,879 --> 04:20:08,180
Let's do, I'm gonna do hammer. Very cool. How do I put, how do I put the hammer on?

1081
04:20:10,459 --> 04:20:28,409
I think it's already on. We're born orphans. So it doesn't take stamina or anything. Nice.

1082
04:20:31,799 --> 04:20:34,920
10,000 people joined after the poll. I mean that we're, we're, we're very late.

1083
04:20:52,500 --> 04:20:59,940
Screen shake aside, I think this game is actually, the demo is, is very fun. I think the game is,

1084
04:20:59,940 --> 04:21:04,579
okay, I think this is, I think this game is going to be good. I think it's going to be very good.

1085
04:21:05,459 --> 04:21:31,829
Bland 3.7. If I could play without screen shake, it's a four. I genuinely think this game would be

1086
04:21:31,829 --> 04:21:40,139
fun. It is fun. I'm just a fucking baby. I'm not kidding. I genuinely think this is a really,

1087
04:21:40,139 --> 04:21:45,590
really cool game. Genuinely. In fact, I'm going to play it for another few minutes.

1088
04:21:55,190 --> 04:22:00,540
If Morbius gets a re-release, we deserve another poll. I have nothing to do with Morbius.

1089
04:22:03,530 --> 04:22:12,549
Why are you acting like I was on the team of people that made that movie? Nice. That was cool.

1090
04:22:16,020 --> 04:22:48,459
Shit. Ooh, I got a new level up. Ooh, another shortcut.

1091
04:22:52,180 --> 04:23:03,139
Morbius gets another re-release. Just wait till they make Morbius 2 and they lean so heavily

1092
04:23:03,139 --> 04:23:19,860
into all the memes. Look, they're going to recast Jared Leto with Jay Leno and they're going to try

1093
04:23:19,860 --> 04:23:39,780
to make it with makeup so you can't tell the difference. Shit. All right, this game is fun.

1094
04:23:39,780 --> 04:23:44,100
The Mold's grave was lost and time has passed. The moon has grown hungry, toughening the clayborns.

1095
04:23:44,739 --> 04:23:51,500
Putting moon right at a dart is a lot of info. That's a 3.7 and I would, if I could play it

1096
04:23:51,500 --> 04:23:57,610
without screen shake, that's probably a 4.0. That gets the game seems pretty great. I think

1097
04:23:57,610 --> 04:24:02,569
the star of the show. So what do they give the feet game? Because I need to redo that.

1098
04:24:03,290 --> 04:24:09,399
What do they give the feet game? That was a five out of five. Yeah. Okay. Just making sure.

1099
04:24:10,120 --> 04:24:14,629
All right, let's do one more. I don't want to go too late. I just wanted to stream for at least a

1100
04:24:14,629 --> 04:24:20,280
few hours. Let's do one more. I'm going to, this is 3.7 out of five and I think it's going to be

1101
04:24:20,280 --> 04:24:23,719
really fun. I think people are going to really enjoy it. It's definitely a lot of work went into

1102
04:24:23,719 --> 04:24:29,239
it. A lot of amazing artwork. Story seems really cool. That was a pretty cool reveal right there.

1103
04:24:29,239 --> 04:24:37,110
I don't know. We'll find out, but it's, I could see that being very fun. You know what I'm really

1104
04:24:37,110 --> 04:24:43,020
happy about though? There has been no games that I've played so far in this kind of at least a

1105
04:24:43,020 --> 04:24:50,659
featured one. That was like just shitty. These are all been very good. All right. What should

1106
04:24:50,659 --> 04:25:05,319
we do for the last one for the night? Distera survival FPS. There's moon scars. Well, dude,

1107
04:25:05,319 --> 04:25:16,329
we'll do that tomorrow. People have been looking forward to that. Sapiens. It's a God game. All

1108
04:25:16,329 --> 04:25:26,680
right. I want to do this one tomorrow. One military camp strategy, Alaskan truck simulator. Okay.

1109
04:25:30,069 --> 04:25:38,709
Gunner heat PC, SCP secret files. Okay. That would be probably fun. Destroy all humans too.

1110
04:25:41,780 --> 04:25:57,459
Resist the succubus, the end of the female night. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and just scroll over

1111
04:25:57,459 --> 04:26:12,860
that one. Gunsmith simulator. I could have seen the, it says literally in the title. Gunsmith.

1112
04:26:12,860 --> 04:26:23,129
This seems cool. Broken pieces. There's a lot here. There's no light. Whoa. Look at this one.

1113
04:26:23,129 --> 04:26:43,819
Pixel graphics. Bail or jail. Celico. Tyrant's blessing. I'm not gonna, I'm not playing the

1114
04:26:43,819 --> 04:26:58,500
succubus game. Guys. The last worker. I need one more to go out on. Come on. This one looks kind

1115
04:26:58,500 --> 04:27:09,879
of good. Difficult. Souls like action. I can already see the shaking screen in the trailer.

1116
04:27:11,079 --> 04:27:40,170
I might just get an old hype squad free to play nitro kid. Cool. Ooh. Turbo golf racing. All right.

1117
04:27:40,170 --> 04:27:44,540
Come on. Just, I need one. I didn't want to go out on play that one. All right. I'll try it.

1118
04:27:44,540 --> 04:28:00,889
I'll try nine souls. All right. I'm going to try it. I'm going to give it a chance. Let's go play

1119
04:28:00,889 --> 04:28:07,620
the succubus game with only the face cam on. You want me to play a game that you want me to,

1120
04:28:11,979 --> 04:28:14,700
this is something that you're not going to convince me to do. I just want to make sure you're

1121
04:28:15,180 --> 04:28:26,309
aware of that. I'm not going to play the hentai succubus game with the stream on and me sitting

1122
04:28:26,309 --> 04:28:34,600
here just like, guys, I wonder what's on the screen. Why would I ever do that? Trying to get

1123
04:28:34,600 --> 04:28:50,729
me banned. All right. Let's open it. Nine souls demo. Let's give it a try. We'll go out on this

1124
04:28:50,729 --> 04:29:00,569
one. Thanks for sticking around. I know we're late. I'm sorry. We're up so late, but cool. Here we go.

1125
04:29:00,569 --> 04:29:10,579
So you're not going to some of this game may be considered violent or cruel, explicit violence.

1126
04:29:10,579 --> 04:29:56,090
Wait, what? Okay. Okay. Got those. Got that. Whoa, that's not right. What's with this 80?

1127
04:29:56,090 --> 04:30:16,219
Okay. Explain this to me. What's with the 99 Hertz? I don't understand this. I don't see a

1128
04:30:16,219 --> 04:30:36,299
screen shake option, but it's okay. It's kind of loud. We're gonna raid. What's going on, everybody?

1129
04:30:36,299 --> 04:30:43,719
Welcome. Atriach raid. Thanks a lot, Atriach. Welcome. Hope you had a good stream. What was

1130
04:30:43,719 --> 04:30:48,520
Atriach doing? What were you doing? Something interesting, probably. Atriach always doing

1131
04:30:48,520 --> 04:30:58,760
something interesting. I got ex-squeezed. Was it supposed to be dial? Wait, is there audio? Balloons.

1132
04:30:58,760 --> 04:31:06,870
That game is hard as shit. So good luck with that one. Now, welcome, guys. We are doing something.

1133
04:31:06,870 --> 04:31:17,540
We're gonna do this tomorrow, too. We are doing Steam demos. If you go to Steam, you go to the

1134
04:31:17,540 --> 04:31:22,100
store page. There's a shitload of coming-soon games that aren't out yet that have demos,

1135
04:31:22,100 --> 04:31:26,420
and it's a big event, and I'm telling you, it's cool, and you better check it out, because it's

1136
04:31:26,420 --> 04:31:30,260
only gonna be here for like another week or so. So we're doing this tomorrow, too. I'm gonna pick

1137
04:31:30,260 --> 04:31:36,569
random games on this list. We're gonna check them out. Check them out Thursdays. No, thanks. Thanks

1138
04:31:36,569 --> 04:31:47,670
for the raid, seriously. This one's called Nine Souls. There were hints of a tuber in there? Of

1139
04:31:47,670 --> 04:32:00,229
course there was. There always is. What is with the pee your pants stuff? I mean, I did it like an

1140
04:32:00,229 --> 04:32:06,979
hour ago. It's dried since then. I mean, the smell was a little much, but that got used to it over

1141
04:32:06,979 --> 04:32:28,629
a while. Art's really good, and again, all you raiders, we're rating games out of five. The demos,

1142
04:32:28,629 --> 04:32:34,389
we're rating the demos out of five. The art's... Oh, he smokes weed! Oh, this is definitely like a

1143
04:32:34,389 --> 04:32:41,719
five. I'll give it a five right off the bat. Big bro. I smelled barbecue fish all the way back there.

1144
04:32:41,719 --> 04:32:49,819
Oh, that fish does not look good at all. It's like there's nothing on it. I like the sound effect,

1145
04:32:49,819 --> 04:32:57,260
though. Looks like you snagged a good haul of fish today. You're a true hunter. I forget that I'm

1146
04:32:57,260 --> 04:33:05,139
cooking dinner today. You have to leave room for my carefully prepared delicacies. Cook as much as

1147
04:33:05,139 --> 04:33:09,000
you like. I'll eat it all. All right, you've been here for ages. You must finally be getting used

1148
04:33:09,000 --> 04:33:22,259
to the food, huh? Okay, follow me to the secret hideout. Oh, it's so beautiful. It's so pretty.

1149
04:33:23,619 --> 04:33:30,970
Very much appreciate a demo. That just gets right to it, right to the point.

1150
04:33:31,529 --> 04:33:53,139
Go down. Yep. Jump higher. Cool. This game's gorgeous. What's this? Pick up dead man's notes.

1151
04:33:53,779 --> 04:34:20,340
Okay, is there a dash? I am not seeing any of that thing we don't like. We're starting at five.

1152
04:34:20,340 --> 04:34:38,200
It's only downhill from here, though. Okay, go get the crimson. Okay, so get up there and go

1153
04:34:38,200 --> 04:34:45,689
get the... All right, I gotta fight this pig. You guys are embarrassing us in front of new viewers.

1154
04:34:46,569 --> 04:35:01,319
You're not embarrassing me. You're embarrassing yourself. It's Otto.

1155
04:35:03,209 --> 04:35:24,580
That looks like Otto. Okay. All right, I'll bring it back. Cool. Let's move. But yeah,

1156
04:35:24,580 --> 04:35:31,209
the steam demo thing is going on to the 20th, right? So there's still a little bit of time.

1157
04:35:31,209 --> 04:35:45,020
We need to check him out. Do I fight? Sure. I don't want to kill it. Can I just take it?

1158
04:35:45,020 --> 04:36:02,580
I don't want to kill it. I guess I did. Okay, crimson hibiscus. No fall damage. Good.

1159
04:36:02,580 --> 04:36:22,139
And here's a flower. Let's go to the village. What the hell are you guys saying? You're making

1160
04:36:22,139 --> 04:36:29,930
us look crazy. Why are you even writing this? Market is really bustling today. It was obviously

1161
04:36:29,930 --> 04:36:35,209
a good harvest. Everyone's brought their surplus grains to trade before the ceremony starts.

1162
04:36:36,630 --> 04:36:43,220
That's all we do. Yeah, you guys have a tendency to be a little weird. I did just say I pissed my

1163
04:36:43,220 --> 04:36:47,299
pants and it smelled bad. So I'm at fault too, but that's not as weird as pooping your pants.

1164
04:36:50,569 --> 04:36:56,740
Okay, don't I don't just don't let me influence you. Okay.

1165
04:37:06,889 --> 04:37:10,090
We're weird. Yeah, you are kind of weird. Look at what you're writing. Everyone's telling me

1166
04:37:10,090 --> 04:37:17,430
to shit my pants on camera. It's like 60% of the chat. That's a little strange, don't you think?

1167
04:37:33,130 --> 04:38:01,450
Just ban the word poopoo. Okay, cool. What the hell? I knew I heard it. Everything looks so

1168
04:38:01,450 --> 04:38:06,759
pretty. Thanks for your help today. It's an old custom of ours to wear this flower during the

1169
04:38:06,759 --> 04:38:10,599
ceremony. Only the chosen ones get to wear it that day. There are no written rules about it,

1170
04:38:10,599 --> 04:38:13,400
but everyone knows that the bigger the flower, the more glory you receive.

1171
04:38:14,119 --> 04:38:18,759
I knew you cared about me and that you'd help me get the flower. Still today was the last time

1172
04:38:18,759 --> 04:38:23,959
we'll go walking together in the woods. I really can't believe it was me that was chosen. Is it

1173
04:38:23,959 --> 04:38:27,959
because I always try to do good or because my parents put in a good word for me with the gods?

1174
04:38:28,680 --> 04:38:54,740
Only God knows. I'm not fecal funny. It's you guys. That tasted like ass. This has been sitting here

1175
04:38:54,740 --> 04:38:58,979
all day and I just like drank whatever's at the bottom of it. That tasted awful.

1176
04:38:59,939 --> 04:39:16,040
We've got to get to the gameplay. I need to say I got to give you my assessment. Let's

1177
04:39:16,040 --> 04:39:25,659
don't ask him that. Okay, day of the ceremony. Incoming signal. What do you mean signal?

1178
04:39:27,099 --> 04:39:31,340
It's me. Your wounds must have pretty much healed by now. I just want to remind you that

1179
04:39:31,340 --> 04:39:35,740
the time has come. The passageway only opens again in half a year. If you miss it this time,

1180
04:39:35,740 --> 04:39:40,419
you'll be in dire straits. Make a move already. Those animals have kept you long enough.

1181
04:39:40,979 --> 04:39:55,189
Remember, be discreet. Don't let yourself be seen. What were you doing sneaking about just now?

1182
04:39:55,750 --> 04:40:01,130
I was just talking to myself. Save it. I knew there was something fishy about you.

1183
04:40:01,130 --> 04:40:03,849
Don't think you can fool me just because you wear that bamboo hat of yours.

1184
04:40:04,650 --> 04:40:08,250
A paradise in the sky? Gods? I don't know who made up that hogwash, but I know

1185
04:40:08,250 --> 04:40:12,330
it's odd. Laugh all you want. You wait and say I'll prove it to these morons.

1186
04:40:22,009 --> 04:40:51,049
Wow. Firecrackers. Okay. Let me see. That's a bit of a harsh pull. Not going to lie.

1187
04:40:53,110 --> 04:41:22,279
Why? Is it bad? I can't see it. Is it bad? Yikes. So what am I doing here? I probably

1188
04:41:22,279 --> 04:41:37,110
shouldn't have skipped all the dialogue in the room. Okay. I respect the flying throne.

1189
04:41:37,110 --> 04:41:46,979
What's going on here? I'm going to sacrifice this guy, right?

1190
04:41:50,419 --> 04:42:30,150
What the fuck? Wait, what? We're doing... Oh no, that's not good. What the fuck? No.

1191
04:42:30,709 --> 04:42:36,709
The ceremony is sacrifices. All right, this is crazy.

1192
04:42:43,319 --> 04:42:47,159
Big bro, thank you for taking care of me for the past two years. I'm going now.

1193
04:42:52,310 --> 04:43:02,150
Huh? Tatch foo charm.

1194
04:43:16,470 --> 04:43:25,900
Please spare us from your wrath, oh gods. Big bro, what's going on? All right. I'm way more

1195
04:43:25,900 --> 04:43:30,840
interested. I should not have skipped everything. That was my mistake. This just got really, really

1196
04:43:30,840 --> 04:43:38,020
interesting. And I skipped... God damn it. I skipped the movie. I'm not your big bro. What do

1197
04:43:38,020 --> 04:43:44,520
you mean? Who are you if not my big bro? Who exactly are you? I said, what's the dog doing?

1198
04:43:45,400 --> 04:43:51,180
What just happened? Why did you do that? Where are you going? I'm going to put the helmet on?

1199
04:44:09,220 --> 04:44:23,180
Human body treatment field. All right, let's go. Reflect. Nice. Press to attach foo charm on

1200
04:44:23,180 --> 04:44:39,689
enemy. Ooh. Detonate. What? What's wrong with me? Uh-oh. Oh, you fucking smoke weed, kid. Fucking

1201
04:44:39,689 --> 04:45:00,009
heal up. What is this? Rest? So is this like a Dark Souls game? Oh, that hurt. Okay, hold on.

1202
04:45:01,529 --> 04:45:17,049
Nice. 4.7. It went down. All right, there's a dash. 4.8 went up. I didn't think there was a dash. It

1203
04:45:17,049 --> 04:45:35,610
went up. Back to 4.8. What is this? Blood soaked... Oh, this is their bodies. This is their... Oh,

1204
04:45:35,610 --> 04:45:55,849
okay. That's what they... They turned into like this mush. Right, I can run up the wall, right?

1205
04:45:55,849 --> 04:46:22,729
Yep. What is going on here? Oh, to the guy in chat that said I was never going to use charms.

1206
04:46:25,369 --> 04:47:41,659
You just got timed out for two minutes. Get owned. Get owned. Ow. 4.6. 4.5. I got to get...

1207
04:47:41,659 --> 04:47:44,939
Okay, if I get all three of these guys in one charm explosion, it's a 4.6.

1208
04:47:48,150 --> 04:48:14,180
Excuse me? What the hell was that? All right, 4.3. That was... I landed. That wasn't a skill

1209
04:48:14,180 --> 04:48:21,349
issue. I didn't know I didn't need instant kill. This is creepy, though. This is actually really

1210
04:48:21,349 --> 04:48:40,540
weird. How many charms can I use? Do I have a finite amount? This is weird. Origin of ape man?

1211
04:48:41,340 --> 04:49:05,290
All right, I actually want to know. Okay, how do I read it? Warning. Warning.

1212
04:49:05,290 --> 04:49:18,889
Perimeter breach by living organism. Warning. Shut it down. It's all happening. With that

1213
04:49:18,889 --> 04:49:23,689
stunt of yours, it looks like new Pengly will be abuzz with commotion for a while.

1214
04:49:24,919 --> 04:49:29,000
E, why'd you strike that early? It wasn't part of the plan. Was it to save that human child?

1215
04:49:29,000 --> 04:49:31,799
If you always break with protocol, it's going to be really tough to execute our plan.

1216
04:49:32,599 --> 04:49:37,979
One of your business. I know what my duties are. Don't worry. It's just if you had waited a bit

1217
04:49:37,979 --> 04:49:41,580
longer before destroying the machine, I could have covered up the alarm. I hope you'll stick

1218
04:49:41,580 --> 04:50:03,180
to the script more in the future. This music is wild. Am I going to get a boss fight before

1219
04:50:03,180 --> 04:50:24,180
the demo ends? Nice. All right, so you get three heals. I'm getting some kind of currency, too,

1220
04:50:24,819 --> 04:50:34,299
in the top right. Oh, it's a checkpoint. You set up an intrusion alarm. To unlock the gate,

1221
04:50:34,299 --> 04:51:14,360
you have to trick out the guards. Let's do it. That wasn't too bad. Say the line again? What?

1222
04:51:14,360 --> 04:51:34,599
That's good. When does this game come out? Fuck it, that hurt. Quarter two,

1223
04:51:34,599 --> 04:51:55,990
2023. Damn, that's far away. That's far away. That's in a whole year. That's really good.

1224
04:51:55,990 --> 04:52:17,590
It's in good shape for that release. Yeah, I mean, it feels that way. Hell, yeah. Get in the hang of

1225
04:52:17,590 --> 04:52:51,580
it. I thought it went down. I guess not. Shit. He was in the wall. I couldn't see. What do you do

1226
04:52:51,580 --> 04:53:16,220
with the money, though? Chest up there. I want to... It does kind of feel like Sekiro with the parry,

1227
04:53:16,220 --> 04:53:30,979
parry, parry, parry. Ooh, skill tree. Max energy. This one. Chi explosions are from the charms,

1228
04:53:30,979 --> 04:54:03,900
right? I'm very hungry. Oh my god, I haven't eaten all day. I have not eaten a single piece of food.

1229
04:54:03,900 --> 04:54:10,549
Holy shit, that's bad. No, that's not true. I had a little... In between from when this

1230
04:54:10,549 --> 04:54:19,270
tree had turned up, I had a sandwich. Pizza is going to be out of the question now. I don't

1231
04:54:19,349 --> 04:54:33,770
think I can get pizza at midnight. No, I had a sandwich at 6 30 or so, six o'clock when the

1232
04:54:33,770 --> 04:54:49,380
stream went down the first time. No, I forgot that I ate. I'm good. I was right there at the end.

1233
04:54:49,380 --> 04:55:03,220
Shit. All right. Okay. Hold on. All right. Please somebody write this down because I don't

1234
04:55:03,220 --> 04:55:13,180
remember, but I want to remember this game when it comes out a year from now. Yep. All right. All

1235
04:55:13,180 --> 04:55:21,689
right. All right. All right. Wish listed. Yeah, I know, dude, but I have on my wish list.

1236
04:55:22,330 --> 04:55:28,700
Um, cry of fear is still on my wish list. I think I put it on there back in like

1237
04:55:29,340 --> 04:55:41,130
2010. I just don't even look. I literally don't even look at it. All right. I got it. I get it.

1238
04:55:41,130 --> 04:55:46,569
This is a I'm very happy with the games we play today because all of them have been good. They've

1239
04:55:46,569 --> 04:55:51,509
all been actually really good. I've not we've not seen one of the seven or eight games we played.

1240
04:55:51,509 --> 04:55:59,639
None of them have been bad. That's it. You know, that's really encouraging. I talked a lot of shit

1241
04:55:59,639 --> 04:56:12,259
about Diablo immortal earlier. People are still making games, man. They are. It's easy to forget

1242
04:56:12,259 --> 04:56:25,369
sometimes. They're all on the featured list. Are these indie? Yeah. Well, that's what I mean. Like

1243
04:56:26,490 --> 04:56:32,119
every time that I play a AAA game, I always kind of with some exceptions, obviously. Right.

1244
04:56:33,000 --> 04:56:45,779
I come away with it going. Yeah. Yeah. Like whatever. I just don't care. I'm trying to

1245
04:56:45,779 --> 04:56:48,740
think of what was some AAA games that have come out the last year or two that I really actually

1246
04:56:48,740 --> 04:56:56,340
liked. I think Elden Ring is just all right. It's a great out. It's already at the top.

1247
04:56:59,060 --> 04:57:18,569
Oh, you accumulate Chi that way. I get it. Yeah. Elden Ring. But before Elden Ring,

1248
04:57:18,569 --> 04:57:26,520
what else did I like? Resident Evil 8 was all right. Yeah, it was AAA games are super expensive.

1249
04:57:26,520 --> 04:57:29,560
Companies hate to risk with their money. So most of them are just kind of generic.

1250
04:57:31,959 --> 04:57:41,639
I yeah, but but I mean, I'm AAA games 510 plus years ago weren't like that. I don't think that's

1251
04:57:41,639 --> 04:57:52,069
necessarily correct. Don't bad chest me. Don't bad chest me. Don't bad chest me.

1252
04:57:52,869 --> 04:58:03,590
Did I just die? Oh, they were way lower budget before times have changed in the last five to

1253
04:58:03,590 --> 04:58:17,220
10 years. Yeah. I think that we just saw so many just world defining video games back in like the

1254
04:58:17,220 --> 04:58:27,180
mid 2000s. It's easy to forget that there's other games that have come out. 2017 was five years ago.

1255
04:58:27,180 --> 04:58:45,580
Don't even say that that Jesus world. Oh my god, world defining stuff. Compared to movies,

1256
04:58:45,580 --> 04:58:52,380
the money used for video games is lower. Yeah. Just take screen shake out of your game.

1257
04:58:57,270 --> 04:59:03,779
I think that's it. We'll be live tomorrow. I'm going to try to start somewhere like there on

1258
04:59:03,779 --> 04:59:07,939
four o'clock tomorrow. This time actually starting at four and not leaving in an hour because the

1259
04:59:08,500 --> 04:59:15,400
internet is fucked up. You kind of dried up the featured section. Yeah, we'll go category by

1260
04:59:15,400 --> 04:59:22,810
category and just kind of scroll through. I'm not going to play this Succubus game. No.

1261
04:59:23,369 --> 04:59:28,180
But that's it. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a good one. Thanks for watching. Thanks for

1262
04:59:28,180 --> 04:59:38,340
participating in the stream. I have to apologize because if you weren't here earlier, I was having

1263
04:59:38,340 --> 04:59:47,270
twitch server problems again. And it really kind of blew up the whole stream. I kind of

1264
04:59:48,139 --> 04:59:52,259
took a break for two hours and came back. I'm glad it ended up working. I'm glad I actually

1265
04:59:52,259 --> 04:59:57,740
got a server that actually works. So thanks for watching. See you tomorrow. Same time for

1266
04:59:57,740 --> 05:00:06,700
p.m. We're gonna do this again. No game on that feature list was under a 3.5 out of 5.

1267
05:00:06,700 --> 05:00:16,259
They were all solid games, which excites me. All right. Good night, guys. See you later.

1268
05:00:16,259 --> 05:00:22,009
Oh, we got a minute. So we got like two minutes while the credits roll up.

1269
05:00:22,009 --> 05:00:42,069
Happy birthday to please say happy birthday. Hey, star lapel. Happy birthday. What's the worst game

1270
05:00:42,069 --> 05:00:54,650
that you played today? I don't think there is a worst game. Baseball. Yeah, I said it in the

1271
05:00:54,650 --> 05:01:02,569
beginning of the stream, but I'll say it again. Baseball is moving from July 14th to July 20th.

1272
05:01:02,569 --> 05:01:22,250
We had to make a last minute change. The German Baseball Association will be on July 20th. Diablo

1273
05:01:22,250 --> 05:01:33,479
Immortal. I think all of them sat at a base level of good. The best one was definitely the fee game.

1274
05:01:33,479 --> 05:01:43,380
Angry Foot, whatever it was called. Green screen update. We are almost done vetting the actions.

1275
05:01:43,380 --> 05:01:56,360
I will give you a date that I'm going in front of the screen in the next week, I'd say. Yeah,

1276
05:01:56,360 --> 05:02:04,580
that game was unbelievably fun. There was a team name change. Yeah, but that's not why we had to

1277
05:02:05,459 --> 05:02:12,779
push the event by a week. There was some stuff with the venue that we had to we just had to move

1278
05:02:12,779 --> 05:02:21,299
it. We couldn't do it on that date. There was some stuff that we the venue had to change. Your team

1279
05:02:21,299 --> 05:02:30,540
names are the California Clowns versus the Maryland Magicians. That's one I wouldn't miss. July 20th.

1280
05:02:30,540 --> 05:02:35,060
It's gonna be an exhibition game. Probably right in the middle of the season because I feel like

1281
05:02:35,060 --> 05:02:48,520
that's a good place to do it. Where do the names come from? Well, I'll tell you. It's called Random

1282
05:02:48,520 --> 05:02:55,689
Name of State. That's it. Does it roll? What do you mean? What do you mean where to get it from?

1283
05:02:55,689 --> 05:02:59,930
This is a baseball league that's been operating for a long time. What do you mean? Where do the

1284
05:02:59,930 --> 05:03:08,700
names come from? I don't know. I didn't pick the names. Why are you asking me that question? I mean,

1285
05:03:08,700 --> 05:03:15,770
I am, you know, commissioner, owner, and operator of the entire league. But I mean, there's various

1286
05:03:15,770 --> 05:03:36,020
reasons why you'd have certain cities in certain states. July 20th. Don't forget the baseball mogul

1287
05:03:36,020 --> 05:03:57,990
doesn't know his own teams. Yeah, I do apologize again for the I mean, I streamed for like two

1288
05:03:57,990 --> 05:04:04,459
hours earlier and it was just frame drops, steam maintenance. It just didn't go well.

1289
05:04:05,099 --> 05:04:14,409
Let's get back in the saddle tomorrow. Yeah, and Atriarch. Thanks for the raid, Atriarch.

1290
05:04:14,409 --> 05:04:23,060
If some of you Atriarch fans are here. He is a stand up dude. I highly recommend you go follow

1291
05:04:23,060 --> 05:04:28,540
Atriarch if you don't already. I don't know what you're doing with your life. But that needs to be

1292
05:04:28,540 --> 05:04:41,209
corrected immediately. Very, very cool, dude. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Good night, guys.
