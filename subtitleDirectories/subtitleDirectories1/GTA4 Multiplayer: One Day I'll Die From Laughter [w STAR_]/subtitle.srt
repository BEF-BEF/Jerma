1
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,219
Having a cigarette? Yeah, sometimes I'd like to smoke down here.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,420
Oh, that was a headshot.

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm pulling off my headphones.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,300
I'm gonna pass it out.

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:45,890
Did you hit that guy right in the mouth?

6
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,990
Did you hit him right in the mouth?

7
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,079
Look at this guy. Look at this. Is this an EMT?

8
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,909
Is he empty? He's like, what the fuck happened?

9
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:00,100
He's walking away.

10
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,979
He doesn't want anything to do with this, I don't think.

11
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:08,780
I just took a drink. I was about to start spitting up. Oh my god.

12
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,579
The EMT around the corner just doesn't want any part of it.

13
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,980
Yo, the EMT. This guy's like, look, he's driving away.

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,209
That might have been the funniest clip I've ever seen in GTA.

15
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:27,810
I'm serious. That really might have been the funniest clip I've ever fucking seen in this game.

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:38,819
What? Where? Where am I? Where are we?

17
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,969
What? What's going on?

18
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,769
You're disappearing when I drive here on my screen.

19
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:48,170
There is no where I'm seeing like underneath the ground.

20
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,299
I'm not even on your bike. Try to like keep going.

21
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,099
Where are we? Oh, wait, where am I?

22
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,760
Why did I turn into you? Press to get off the bike.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,060
It says you're on it, but you're not there.

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,760
What is this guy doing? Yeah, you're invisible.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,319
There's a guy in here too. Can you see this guy?

26
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,620
No. He just got on the bike.

27
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,090
What? What?

28
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,430
Who is that phantom? Who is that guy?

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,389
Am I on the... Keep going.

30
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,889
What? I don't know if you're invisible.

31
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,689
Whoever you're fighting isn't here. I'm so confused.

32
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:40,090
Dude, this is insane.

33
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,930
There's another guy on the bike in like the ghost world.

34
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,620
Just smash into something. Can I fight this guy?

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,979
This guy had a machine gun.

36
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,180
Can you kill yourself? Apparently I'm falling now.

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm doing like a dance.

38
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,300
I'm doing like a Blues Brothers dance.

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,099
I'm trying to find a way to like get out of here.

40
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:19,569
Like another way to like another dimension.

41
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,069
Like we're just both quiet. Just like, yes, yes.

42
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,680
Yeah, well, you don't like hang on doors for fun.

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,479
Every pedestrian that walks by too looks at you and is like,

44
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,800
What the fuck? Where are they?

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,199
I want to get somebody over here.

46
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,280
You don't think you're not going to say anything?

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,180
That was weird. You should have said something.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,099
You should have said something about that.

49
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,099
Get in the middle of the road, Jerma.

50
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:58,349
This guy's an idiot. He's aiming the gun at you.

51
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:01,909
You're not even close to being over here.

52
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:11,819
What is he doing? What is he doing?

53
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,620
I'm like hanging out with the cop.

54
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:40,060
He's utterly confused right now.

55
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,560
So lady, do you know how to get to 42nd Street from here?

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,959
Well, yes, it's very easy.

57
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,259
What you want to do son is you want to go.

58
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,060
You got to listen to this guy.

59
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
This guy just said to pull over.

60
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,360
You have to listen.

61
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,220
Okay.

62
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,420
All right. He said get out of the car.

63
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,519
Okay.

64
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,319
I'm sorry officer.

65
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,720
I got a gun.

66
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,319
I don't want. I don't want to get.

67
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,290
What is this? What's going?

68
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,500
We'll see one eventually.

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,600
Yeah. Look for one. Look for one.

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,500
I'm trying.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,899
Do you see the subway?

72
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,500
I think so.

73
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,910
I think this one over still alive with my parachute.

74
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,910
Put it on.

75
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,949
Oh epic.

76
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,449
Epic.

77
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,100
Absolutely epic.

78
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,379
Epic.

79
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,579
That shouldn't have killed me.

80
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,180
What is?

81
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,879
Oh, right.

82
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,730
You're in a helicopter.

83
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,629
What is this place?

84
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,129
I don't remember any of this.

85
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,730
Are you getting the weird territory though?

86
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,980
Because I don't like you.

87
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,680
I saw a sick jump.

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,879
Hold on sick jump.

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,860
You talking about the slide?

90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,360
Yeah, it's like a ramp.

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
That was so stupid.

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,959
Are you on this?

93
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,259
What's going on?

94
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,360
Who's on it?

95
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,459
You're on it.

96
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,459
I can't.

97
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm trying to get off.

98
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,850
No, don't.
