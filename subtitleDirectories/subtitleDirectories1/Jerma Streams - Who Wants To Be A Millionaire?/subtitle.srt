1
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:41,750
How is it going? What's up? How you doing? I got the urge to play who wants to be a millionaire.

2
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,820
I want to play it. I know that there was some thoughts of what would happen today. What would

3
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,700
happen in the next few streams. But I was like, you know what? I want to play that. Sounds fun.

4
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:09,750
Sounds like a good time. Why are you at the Red Bull thing? Oh, I've seen the clip a few times.

5
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:17,450
Also, off-brand was on that show. So I was like, you know what? Maybe I'll pop in.

6
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:25,269
Say hello. So off-brand was doing some work on that show. I was able to kind of peek in,

7
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:36,200
say hello. Are you the sus guy? Ban that person for like a week. At least. I mean at least a week.

8
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,260
Hey, good morning, kid. Hey, good morning. Good morning, wherever you are.

9
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:58,629
Get a load of this guy. Yeah. What's up? It was great to see Ster and Ashley. It's actually

10
00:01:58,629 --> 00:02:01,189
been a long time since we've been able just to kind of hang out somewhere.

11
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:11,659
So that was really wonderful. Really great to see them. It's been a while. It was really great,

12
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:17,990
though. I got to go pee. Well, you got to. You have a few minutes. Go ahead. Hurry up.

13
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:27,139
Well, no, take your time. Whatever you need to do. I know you already played Monkey Island,

14
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:36,069
but you should play it on stream. Would you guys like a Monkey Island stream? Didn't they do a new?

15
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:43,139
Isn't there like a new game? They made a new game. I feel like I played it for a little bit.

16
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,960
Just jumping around on a only game pass or something, right? Of course it was on game

17
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:08,259
pass. Have you seen Barbie yet? No. No, I haven't. I've been pretty busy. I haven't really had much

18
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:20,139
time to go see a movie or anything. You should play Pikmin 4. Did I even play Pikmin 3? I don't

19
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:27,849
remember. What about Mission Impossible? What about TMNT? What about Oppenheimer? Yeah, there's a lot

20
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:42,379
of movies that I just haven't watched. What happened to Toontown? Heard on Stirstream that

21
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:52,069
you got sick. Yeah. So let me give you just a brief synopsis of that. So Ster and Ashley were here

22
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,750
and it was a great time. It was a wonderful time. I want to say the second day they were here,

23
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:08,180
I got food poisoning and it was just me. I was the only one. It was bad and I thought the whole

24
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,740
trip was going to get ruined. I was like, oh no, here I am up here going through it so bad.

25
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,279
I cannot wait to... Well, not I cannot wait, but I know I'm going to go talk to Ster and it's going

26
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:28,279
to be, oh yeah, dude, I got it too. Or like Holly, I got it too. Or Ashley, I got it too.

27
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,319
No, I was the only one. It was just me. I must've been the sorry asshole that touched the thing or

28
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:42,220
ate the thing, whatever it was. And it fucked me up big time for like 12 hours. After 12 hours,

29
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:50,180
I was immediately cured. So that's how I know it was a temporary food poisoning thing. That sucked,

30
00:04:50,180 --> 00:05:02,199
but I'm really, really glad that it was just a quick, really, really fast turnaround. You never

31
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:10,839
did your smurfs homework. No, I don't. And I'm not going to. Give me an F in that class.

32
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,170
But everything going through my mind during that was, oh God, I'm going to, I don't want to ruin

33
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,819
this whole trip. I have to be better. I have to get better. And I was fine. So thankfully,

34
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,019
happy to report that I am completely fine. And I was completely fine after like a day.

35
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:45,910
A super F. Where? Not from my end. I don't see anything here. Hey, I can confirm your

36
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,379
tuna sandwich is great. I added eggs to it. So I hope that's okay. Spin it however you want.

37
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,170
Oh, F on homework. Oh, anytime I see F, I freak out. That letter has turned into just,

38
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,949
it's like, if I see the letter F, it's a pan, it's panic mode. Something's wrong with my stream.

39
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,149
If I see the capital letter F, there is something wrong that I need to go look at my stream setup

40
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:25,319
right now. I'll give you a grotto beast update. The grotto beast tabletop mod digital version

41
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:33,689
is very, very, very close. Keep your eyes peeled over the next week or so. Keep your eyes peeled.

42
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:41,449
Keep an ear to the ground over the next seven days or so. It looks great. The team is doing

43
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:48,699
an amazing job. I had the opportunity to see how it's going for a while and I like what I see.

44
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,779
Really cool. Should be a really fun place to hang out for those of you that just want to play it.

45
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,500
Rather than having to do it in person or somehow figure out a way to play with somebody that you

46
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:15,100
don't really know. I don't like the way that my skin feels. I don't know how to answer that

47
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:23,769
question, but good luck. Do we get a free copy of the digital version if we bought the starter pack?

48
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,660
The digital version, the tabletop simulator version is just free. It's just completely free.

49
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,339
No one has to pay anything. It's just a mod. Well, you have to own tabletop simulator.

50
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,870
It's just going to be a mod we fought with for a long time how to do that.

51
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,860
But it's like, how do we charge for that? Why? I don't think I want to charge for that.

52
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:56,660
Prado Beast was such a success. I don't think it's appropriate to charge for that either,

53
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:11,800
if I'm honest. So just a fun place for you to play it digitally. I have tabletop sim with

54
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:21,189
the Pepe hands up. Oh, nice. You're a terrible businessman. Yeah, whatever. You're built like

55
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:31,579
a shampoo bottle. I'm pretty sick. Can I take a loan out here? No. How come you have a mullet?

56
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:51,700
This is fun. Don't you have to pay people? Well, yeah. Don't worry. It's all good. Okay, don't

57
00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:07,769
worry. I assure you, it's going to be fine. Why do you hate Steve Jackson's story? Hey, it's funny

58
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:22,149
you say that. We're going back to sorcery. The next stream. There you go. There you go. The next

59
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:26,789
time this stream is live after today, it's going to be sorcery part four. How do you feel about

60
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:37,100
that? And then get the trumpet ready. This coming weekend, not this weekend, but next weekend. So

61
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:47,720
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 18, 1920. I'm trying to get the MVM group off the ground. So tentatively

62
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,059
trying to maybe figure out maybe next weekend, be like Saturday or Sunday, maybe Friday. We're

63
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:59,539
kind of trying to see if I can get the group that I wanted to have play play. That should be fun.

64
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:08,059
Looking forward to that. What about Baldur Baldur's Gate three? I don't know if I want to stream

65
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:13,980
Baldur's Gate three, because I feel like I would make a character get into the actual game,

66
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,980
throw a rock at somebody, get like arrested in the game, poop my pants or something, and then

67
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:28,389
be like, I'm kind of done. Because like the actual video game Baldur's Gate, I have no idea even how

68
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:33,720
it plays. I know it's like third person, but it's top down. But I don't know anything about it.

69
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:51,100
That sounds like a great stream. Maybe it's D&D. It's basically just D&D on computer.

70
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,080
I mean, it looks fun. It looks really fleshed out. Just everyone's talking about it. I'm getting the

71
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,679
FOMO. I'm getting Baldur's Gate three FOMO. I'm seeing holy shit. This is the greatest single

72
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,720
experience I've ever experienced in my entire life. It's like, holy shit. Okay. I should probably get

73
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,690
it. Do I get it? And you see like the characters people are making. It's like, whoa, okay.

74
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:22,490
All right. You can make characters and stuff. That sounds fun. So I'm getting Baldur's Gate

75
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,309
FOMO. See if it turns into anything. It's kind of that good, dude. It's sort of that good, really.

76
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,669
All right. Well, all right. Let's get started. I want to just kind of hang up.

77
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:39,190
Had a pretty busy week. Obviously, if you didn't know, Ster and Ashley were here. I had a wonderful

78
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:46,179
time. Besides shitting my brains out for 12 hours. But hey, hey, sometimes stuff just happens.

79
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,559
Life is going to throw shit at you. And you got to be ready to you got to be ready to adapt.

80
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,399
You know what I'm saying? What do you mean, huh? Your milk voice hurts my eyes.

81
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:06,940
Well, you're listening to it. You're not looking at it. You didn't say, did you say that you were

82
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:19,740
shitting for 12 hours? No, but I did now. Now you know. I like this creamy voice.

83
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:30,889
I got like this creamy voice. You played manhunt like a while ago. Hey, I still haven't done my

84
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:40,360
Smurfs homework. I just just know. You know, it's funny about the Smurfs homework. I assigned it

85
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,960
and I didn't even do it. I assigned the homework. I wonder how many of you watched the Smurfs movie

86
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,519
took a bunch of notes and were ready for class. And the teacher just didn't even bring the

87
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:03,019
textbook in. Yeah, you you kids go ahead and go go do this math assignment and bring it in when

88
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:08,340
you're done. Okay, I did the math assignment. It's three days later. It's a week later.

89
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah, we're not doing that shit anymore. We're moving on to it. We're talking about rocks today

90
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:20,379
and where they come from. You know, it's lava. It's lava. You know that? I did. I did. I'm the

91
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:31,659
teacher. I know more than kids. Yeah, lava rocks. Isn't that cool? All right, let's play who wants

92
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:36,759
to be a millionaire is going to hang out. I'm really into the hangout streams lately, as you're

93
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:43,059
probably well aware. Let's go. Let's see if I can get past $32,000 because it's definitely not

94
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:57,700
happening. Maybe it will. All right, let's go. I'm going to play as Pablo. Don't help me either. I

95
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:11,820
don't want any help. If anybody gives any help, they're going to get banned. Is this like an anime?

96
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:25,100
Can I skip the intro or people get mad at me? All right, here we go. Dude, this is a landmark of San

97
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,500
Francisco. I might just get this wrong. The silver porch bridge, the bronze door bridge.

98
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:42,179
Okay, it's gold. It's gold. The silver porch bridge. All right, that's 100 bucks. Easy.

99
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:55,929
Which of these is a cosmetic in cream or cake form used as a base for makeup? Foundation.

100
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:15,210
It's foundation. It's D. 200 bucks. Easy. What animal found when he was abandoned in the jungle

101
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:29,940
as a baby? Oh, okay. It's neither one of these two. Oh, wait, I can cheat. People in chat can

102
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:49,019
just tell me what the answer is. It's one of these two. Blue? I don't think it's blue. I think this

103
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:55,529
is it. I actually was going to pick that one. I even told you it's not one of these two. I told

104
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:02,059
you. I wasn't cheating. I actually was going to pick that one. Complete the name at the end of

105
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:09,940
the saying, meaning it'll be done immediately before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson,

106
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:20,620
Jack Robinson, James Donaldson. It'll be done before you can say Jim Parkinson, John Tompkinson.

107
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,220
I have no idea. I actually have absolutely no idea who says this before you can say

108
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:44,600
James Donaldson. All right, I have to do this. Jack Robinson. How would this many people know

109
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:53,379
that it'll be done before you can say Jack Robinson? I guess it's correct. Is it British?

110
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:02,379
Okay. The offense of willfully telling an untruth in a court after having taken an

111
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:21,980
oath is known as treason, perjury, arson. Oh yeah, arson. That's perjury. Nice. $1,000 for good.

112
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:31,509
What is the common name for the decompression sickness that is a threat to divers? I don't

113
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:42,890
know. C? This is the one I was going to pick. C. No help. No, that wasn't help. It's not the curves.

114
00:17:43,450 --> 00:18:00,359
The game. Llama is a title for a spiritual leader in which religion? Llama? Llama? I don't think

115
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:17,579
it's A. Give me a new question. So let's change the question. I don't know. Town of Telford is

116
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:24,279
named after Thomas Telford, who was famous in which field? This is even, this is even harder.

117
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:34,650
It's probably finance. I feel like it's finance because the, do you have like a bunch of money

118
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:41,180
and like, I'm naming this town after me because I have a shitload of money. Does that make sense?

119
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:54,329
How long ago is this? I can't reliably say. Let's call somebody. It's only the $2,000 question. This

120
00:18:54,329 --> 00:19:04,809
is a disaster. All right. Who am I going to call? I'm going to call, uh, son, wife, sister, granddaughter.

121
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:18,259
Wait, this is my granddaughter. All right. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll call Zelda, my wife.

122
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:30,539
This is who wants to be a millionaire and Pablo needs your wisdom. Well, I'm going to do my best.

123
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:36,900
Zelda, you're my last hope on this one, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. Okay.

124
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:47,509
Not too much. It's C. No doubts whatsoever. No doubt. Okay. I'm, I'm going to go with C.

125
00:19:48,470 --> 00:20:06,220
Okay. C. Damn. Got it. 4,000 the furthest I've ever been to a good start, but you shouldn't stop

126
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:14,630
there. Okay. By what name is the writer Charles Lutwidge Dawgson better known? Charles Lutwidge,

127
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:35,640
Lutwidge Dawgson, Charles Lutwidge Dawgson. I don't know who any of these people are.

128
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:48,259
Okay. I'm going to see. Oh shit. Well, I'm dead. Oh, that's not something you should say.

129
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:53,059
All right. Well, whatever. That was a warmup. That's a warmup. It's fine. By the way,

130
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,980
this doesn't really matter because I have so, I don't even know how I got so many of these.

131
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:15,019
How do I have a million points? Did I cheat? Wait, how did this happen? How did I get a

132
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:19,339
million points? I don't understand how this happened. I really don't understand it.

133
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:30,779
I opened this and had the same reaction. I was like, what? Only do food? A million neurons.

134
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:39,740
Uh, okay. I, there's some of these, I just don't know if I really want it. I don't have like really

135
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:49,220
good answers to. Should we only do superheroes? Should we only do Star Wars and Disney? I guess

136
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:59,210
this one makes sense. Should I just do them all? Who cares? Superheroes and Star Wars only.

137
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,099
Whatever. You don't know much. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't really matter. Does it?

138
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:18,329
How did you not know the answer to Llama? I don't know. All right. Here we go. Here we go. I'm

139
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:21,289
ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm going for it. I'm going to get to at least 32,000.

140
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:28,410
Guaranteed. Guaranteed this time. Who's the main character of Breaking Bad? Uh, Walter Green.

141
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:38,539
It would say D. Nice answer. Let's go for this new eliminatory question.

142
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:44,539
What does a person use to prevent sweat? Antiperspirant. Ant, uh, I did not use any

143
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:50,490
of these sides of this one. C is the right answer. I would state my life. Antimatter.

144
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:00,200
Going quick. Moving quick now. Which Hollywood studio made the films Dumbo and 101 Dalmatians?

145
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:14,869
Disney. Yeah. See? On what planet do the Wookiees live? Oh, shit. I should, I need, wait.

146
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:24,500
I don't know. I think it's one of these two. I'm not looking at chat. I'm not. I'm going to be,

147
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
people are going to think I'm a fucking idiot if I get this wrong.

148
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:36,410
Okay. I had a feeling. I know there's no way to verify if I'm cheating or not,

149
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:43,930
but I'm sure you are not. Who directed the film Star Wars The Last Jedi?

150
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:53,029
Uh, that would be Rian Johnson. I hope I get three Star Wars questions in a row.

151
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,329
Oh, I know this one. I know this one. Bad chest. What name is given to a single gemstone and a

152
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:14,019
piece of jewelry? It's a, put it on emote only. Yeah. Put an emote only for a little bit. Just so

153
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:26,390
I can verify that I'm not cheating. It's a single. That was completely wrong. All right. Whatever.

154
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:37,819
I have a million neurons. You guys think you're smart? I got a million fucking neurons up here.

155
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:47,240
A million. I have a million neurons. You're curious about the joke of this is most humans have

156
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,039
trillions of neurons. So therefore having a million neurons sounds like a large number,

157
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,960
but it's absolutely not. It's a small number. Just want to make sure everyone understands the

158
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:05,960
comedic, uh, the comedic process there. Okay. Yeah. Emote only. Let's go. Emote only.

159
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:26,329
Why? All right. I see. I don't need any help. I'll get it. What is the plural of mouse?

160
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:50,470
Easy. Which word follows tug life and row to give three other terms? What? What word follows tug

161
00:25:50,470 --> 00:26:02,089
life? To row to give three other terms. Wait, what is this? What's this? What's this asking

162
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:16,380
to give three other terms? I mean, it's boat. It's boat, tugboat, lifeboat, rowboat. I don't,

163
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:23,740
this question is weird to me. It's a weird question. I mean, I, there's a weird question.

164
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:37,700
What is the national airline of Ireland? Air shamrock, air shellag, aeroplane, air lingus.

165
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:53,109
All right. I like that. If it's not that it should be, uh, why do I feel like it's this one?

166
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:56,710
It's not this one. It's this one. It's, it's air lingus. It's air lingus. It's air lingus.

167
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:05,990
Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. See? Yeah. I'm not cheating. The Catholic nun born of Albanian

168
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:17,660
parents and known for her work with Calcutta's poor was mother who? Mother Teresa. Give me that

169
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:28,359
thousand bucks. Oh yeah. What is the name of the prequel to Monsters Inc? I don't know. Monsters

170
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:38,650
Inc 2? I don't know this. I actually have no idea. I think it's Monsters University. That sounds

171
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,769
the most correct to me. I've, I didn't, I never said I'd never saw this. I think it's Monsters

172
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:53,369
University. All right. Where were you at on the pyramid? All right. This is a thousand, a thousand.

173
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:57,910
I've got all my lifelines. I'm good. The names of how many U S states begin with the letter K?

174
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:17,299
Um, that's Kansas, Kentucky. A lot of states have the letter K in Alaska, Oklahoma, Nebraska,

175
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:24,970
right? I think this is why they're trying to throw you off here. I think it's just two Kansas and

176
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:33,289
Kentucky. It's two. Yeah, it's two. That's a trick question because a lot of states have K in,

177
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:41,319
in it. You see what I'm doing? The game is getting tougher now with this brand new question. What

178
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:51,109
American drag queen plays the main role in the Netflix series AJ and the queen? Del Rio? Paul?

179
00:28:51,109 --> 00:29:01,559
Actually, I don't know. I don't know. You have to find the right answer. I don't think it's

180
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:09,690
RuPaul. No, I'm going to have to ask. I'm going to have to ask the audience on this one.

181
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:25,539
Okay. I apparently was completely wrong. We're going to go with RuPaul.

182
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,390
Oh, okay. All right. All right. All right. I'm at 2000, 2000.

183
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:46,009
We'll be asked a new question now. How old was Ronald Reagan when he was inaugurated as president?

184
00:29:46,009 --> 00:30:01,690
I don't have any idea. 49, 59, 69 or 79. I don't think it's 49. Uh, I don't think it's 79 either.

185
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:12,140
Maybe it was. I don't know. I'm going to say probably 59. 59. I'm going 79. I feel like that's

186
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:25,640
right. No, it's not. Wait, how long ago is this? This was, I'm saying 59 and I'm going for it.

187
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:34,329
I'm not confident though. I have to call somebody. You decide to play the life.

188
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:39,019
All right. We're going to, who wouldn't know this? All right, Zelda. You're going to come through

189
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:50,019
again. I was going to say 59. Good evening. This is who wants to be a millionaire and Pablo needs

190
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:59,799
your wisdom. Zelda, you're my last hope on this one, but don't put too much pressure on yourself.

191
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:09,180
Okay. Not too much. But when was Ronald Reagan? I would have chosen C, but then again, I'm not sure

192
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,220
about it. All right. Thanks for nothing. Hang the, like literally hang the phone up right now.

193
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:17,190
Cause that, that, that I, I don't know. I was going to say one, this one or this one,

194
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,339
let's just go with it. If it's wrong, it's wrong, but I, I'm going to trust.

195
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:30,700
Okay. Good. Actually good thing. That's a good thing. $8,000. Let's go. I'm going to get harder.

196
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:42,650
Music theory. How many Quavers are there in a crotchet? We're just playing Mad Libs right now.

197
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,900
I don't even know what those two things are. I don't know what a quaver is and I don't know

198
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,259
what a crotchet is. So I, both of those, did you just speak in like old English to me?

199
00:31:53,349 --> 00:32:04,309
Um, how many Quavers are in a crotchet? What's it? Can I ask what a quaver is? What's a quaver?

200
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,900
Uh, I, this is going to be a wild guess. So I'm just going to say new question.

201
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:22,650
Just do star Wars. I don't think you can pick one. We'll plate the female lead in James Dean's last

202
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:41,660
film giant. I'm gravitate. I'm gravitating over her. What, what does this sound? This is 8,000.

203
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:55,380
Okay. Please take away. Let's go. I'm going to try B. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 16,000. We're almost

204
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:02,579
at 32. No lifelines, but it's all right. Recovered from your emotions because here is your new

205
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:12,519
question. In the 1963 film of the same name, what was the pink panther? Uh, with this detective,

206
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,039
but it's not detective. It's thief because the detective is, is the detective the pink panther

207
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,960
or is the detective going after the pink panther? I think that's, that's accurate.

208
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:38,250
The pink panther is a thief. I could be way overthinking this, but I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.

209
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:49,579
I think the thief is the pink panther. The detective is the one going after the pink panther.

210
00:33:49,579 --> 00:34:00,890
What? Unfortunately ends here for you. This is not the right answer. Sorry. Oh, well it was jewel.

211
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:25,159
Oh, all right. We're going to take everything off besides, uh, super heroes. Okay. I have to

212
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:35,300
have at least four packs. Super heroes, star wars, uh, food. I'll, I'll destroy that. And

213
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:44,710
DC. No, I don't know if I know DC comics that well. Disney. No entertainment. No, it could be

214
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:52,710
like, Oh, who was this actor in this 1940s series? We'll go DC. Fine. Star wars, food,

215
00:34:53,269 --> 00:35:14,010
superheroes in DC. See if I can do it. All right. Let's go. I do wonder woman's bracelets do

216
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:30,579
deflect rain. Okay. See, I thought I got it wrong. Trust yourself. Okay. What is Superman's

217
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:42,980
Kryptonian name? Okay. That would be Cal. Which of these movies is the oldest for its release

218
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:54,900
date in theaters? Um, Oh shit. Actually, I think it's the last Jedi. Wait, the oldest,

219
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:05,190
not the newest, the oldest it's Empire Strikes Back. I know my stop. Trust yourself and your

220
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:11,030
acquaintances for this new question. Which character does not appear in the movie wonder woman 1984?

221
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:26,389
Oh, uh, can we just do like mid 2000s to late 2010s? Uh, Marvel universe,

222
00:36:26,949 --> 00:36:43,579
DC, please. I don't know. Shit. This must be easy for me. Aries. Whatever. Actually,

223
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:54,699
I'm sure of it. All right. No more mistakes from what Italian city does had net tone.

224
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,619
Well, judging by how I just pronounced that name, I definitely don't know who this is.

225
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:20,840
So, uh, uh, shit. This is the $500 question. This is a $500 question to me is like,

226
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,019
is Thanos purple? Yes. Yes. Yes or no. That's a $500 question. You know what I mean?

227
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:36,679
This is, this is a way harder question than $500. Um, give me, give me a new question.

228
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:43,079
When Grand Moff Tarkin asks Leia where the rebel base is, what is her answer?

229
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:52,940
I don't know. I don't know. I just went, I like when Darth Vader's on screen and he has like a

230
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:58,730
lightsaber and he goes like, I don't fucking know places. I like when Darth Vader puts his hand up

231
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:07,659
and somebody goes, I didn't pay attention to that. All the other lore. I think it's this one. It's

232
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:21,000
not Dan Tween. It's this one here. It's all it's, it's Alderaan, right? I think this is correct.

233
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:34,360
It's correct. Dan Tween is a real fucking place. Dan Tween. What? I thought it was Tatooine,

234
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:48,070
not Dan Tween. I thought that was the joke answer. All right, we're going again, going again.

235
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,230
This time. I don't know. I guess I don't know that much about these two things.

236
00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:14,039
We're going lifestyle, TV, sports, entertainment. Let's go. Dan Tween. Dan Tween. I've broken

237
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,280
through emote only. Holy fuck. Oh God. That's really funny, but you're going to get tabbed

238
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,739
up for like an hour. I'm just sorry. I'm just telling him it's going to happen. I've broken

239
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:36,150
through. What planet are Superman and Super girl? Whatever. Super. I can't even say Superman. Why?

240
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:46,380
I think they're from Earth. Nah, dude, they're definitely from Venus. They're from Krypton.

241
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:53,739
Krypton. For those of you that don't know. Confetti is most associated with which event?

242
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:04,809
Uh, definitely. It's not a funeral. Wait, what? Where's birthday party? Where's birthday party?

243
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:13,739
Fucking birthday party's not on here. Not a christening. Not a funeral. A wedding? I mean,

244
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:23,500
what is a Hogmanay? What's Hogmanay? Hogmanay. What's that? Does that mean birthday party?

245
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:41,989
I don't think it's wedding. It's Hogmanay. I mean, people throw, you know, oh, like,

246
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:49,610
here comes the bride and groom. We're going to throw the stuff and is it, I guess it's confetti.

247
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,639
I don't, this is so, I don't know what this is. This is weird. What is this here? I'm going wedding.

248
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:05,059
Okay. Yeah. What is a Hogmanay? Trust yourself and your acquaintances for this new question.

249
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,059
Which of these is the name of the American Olympian who won gold medals in 1984,

250
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:18,760
1988, 1992, and 1996? No, I don't think it's Jerry Lewis. It's not Huey Lewis. Um, it's, it's D.

251
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:31,530
Carlos. Huey Lewis. It's time to move on to a new question.

252
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:40,019
Which of these hobbies is a kiln like Louis? Oh, that's clay. Pottery. Final answer. Pottery.

253
00:41:40,019 --> 00:42:01,030
Final answer. Good. What is Wolverine's true identity? Uh, Logan. It's Logan, bub.

254
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:18,659
What? What? Wait, what? Hold on. Isn't it Logan? Logan. He's Logan. James Howlett? What is Logan

255
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:23,619
from? Why is it, why is it Logan? Why is his name Logan? Who calls him Logan? There's a whole movie

256
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:28,659
where Logan's in the whole title of the whole movie. The title is Logan. The movie, his name is

257
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:37,820
Logan. Take off emote only. What happened? I, I'm genuine. I'm curious. What happened? James

258
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:44,550
Jimmy Howlett, also known as Logan or by his code name, the Wolverine. What do you mean bro?

259
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:57,559
What do you mean bro, bro? What? Logan is the scientist's name. It's a nickname. You're a

260
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:09,340
fake fan? Yeah, I am. That's fine. I just, in big bold capital letters, I just remember seeing

261
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,280
Logan. I didn't stop to think, and now I've never seen this movie, so maybe that would help if I

262
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,000
had seen Logan before anybody screams at me. I know. That's the good one. I'm sorry that I saw

263
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,900
X2, X-Men United before I saw Logan. I'm sorry. I have to apologize. I know that's the good one.

264
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:53,659
I know that Logan's the good one. I'm sorry. Fake fan? Yeah. Dantooine. Way too much confidence?

265
00:43:53,659 --> 00:44:01,829
Yeah, a little too much. I was on a roll there too. Can I at least get past like 100,000,

266
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:20,099
200,000? Put manga on? I'll do, I'll put manga on after this. Okay, no messing around. And what

267
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:28,280
would you normally stay overnight while on a camping trip? A phone booth.

268
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:50,860
Okay, C. Jimmy Dantooine Logan. Okay, what shape are samosas? God damn it. I don't, I don't do

269
00:44:50,860 --> 00:45:04,329
shapes. I don't do shapes, guys. I don't. I promise you I don't. I don't do shapes. Hey, do you know

270
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:10,170
like if this is like a hexa octagon? I'm just like, I don't, I don't know. Ask somebody else.

271
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:23,699
Who is the father of Wanda Maximoff aka the Scarlet Witch? Okay, it's not Cyclops.

272
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:39,420
It's not Wolverine. It's not, it's Magneto. Wait, I don't, is it, is it? I think so. Yeah.

273
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:52,199
How many episodes make up Craig Mazin's Chernobyl miniseries? I think it's six. I think it's six.

274
00:45:52,199 --> 00:46:04,809
It's not ten. It's not. No, it's six. What? It's five. God damn it. I didn't see that either.

275
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:16,869
Why is, why are TV shows on here? I don't even watch TV. Why is TV, I don't, I haven't watched

276
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:24,230
a full TV series since season two of Better Call Saul. That's the last television story that I

277
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:31,619
watched a full season of. Why, why would I pick this? I gotta think of things that I do, things

278
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:46,920
that I know. I know food. I know history. I know manga. How about Olympic games? I feel like I,

279
00:46:46,920 --> 00:47:08,650
how about just general culture? Let's do it. See your own game show. Oh, I feel, I've been on a

280
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:19,429
few game shows. It was really fun to be on them. Okay, this is the one. Which punctuation mark is

281
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:32,699
found in the middle of the word isn't? Uh, it's an apostrophe. Which of these is an alternative

282
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:43,559
name for Santa Claus? Father Ted. Father Time. Father Christmas. Father Time. Alright, Father

283
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:55,659
Christmas. Is that wrong? Okay, I was like, no way. In Saint Seiya, from what constellation is

284
00:47:55,659 --> 00:48:15,139
Shun's character the Bronze Knight? Um, constellation. I don't know. Why, everyone's laughing at me for

285
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,780
some reason. What is it, what, what's this from? What is this? Everyone's laughing at me. I'm looking

286
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,860
over here and I'm just seeing, laughing. There's a stadium full of people just laughing at me. And

287
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:34,710
I don't, I don't understand why. I, I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, what constellation? Okay,

288
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:39,429
a dragon is not a constellation. Is there, there's no phoenix constellation. What, this is like a

289
00:48:39,429 --> 00:48:47,670
galaxy. What is it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what this is from. So I'm, I'm going to

290
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:58,679
say Cygnus? Because that's a constellation. That's a galaxy. What? Saint, what does Saint Seiya?

291
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,769
That's like, this is like, Andromeda's a galaxy. That's not a constellation.

292
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:12,440
Oh, this is an, this is an anime. This is a, this is a manga. I thought this was, okay, I thought

293
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:18,440
that, I thought this was real life. I didn't think this was manga. I thought that was a real life. Oh,

294
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:26,199
and Saint Seiya from, I thought that was, okay, whatever. I forgot that we had manga selected.

295
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,949
Anime is real life. That's right. I forgot. That's true.

296
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:42,949
Andromeda is a constellation. I thought it was a galaxy. Dude, anime isn't real. What are you

297
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:53,579
talking about? How could you possibly not known that? He was just moving his hands and not talking.

298
00:49:53,579 --> 00:50:12,469
All right. What name is given to a dishonest or careless workman? I, I don't know. I don't know.

299
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:20,420
I don't know. I don't know. I would, I would, I don't know. I don't know.

300
00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:39,400
What? I thought a cowboy was, that's what a cowboy is. I thought a cowboy was like,

301
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:55,260
you're a rootin' tootin'. Update the game? What? Leave me alone. You lost on the first question.

302
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:10,179
Some of these are weird. You didn't finish Better Call Saul? No? Okay. Um, which of these is a sport

303
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:25,289
involving horses? Show hopping, show jumping, show leaping, or show running. I feel like all of these

304
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:32,730
are correct, but I don't know what the actual answer is. Is that crazy that this is the second

305
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:39,590
one in a row that like, I don't, I don't really know? All of these could be correct. I'm going

306
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:46,380
to say show jumping because that's okay. That's, that makes, is that what it is? Yeah. These are

307
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:55,989
weird first questions. They're too similar. Too similar. We'll be most likely to wear a tutu.

308
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:13,179
Uh, a priest, a chef, or a mountain climber. Okay. When something is completely finished,

309
00:52:13,179 --> 00:52:22,699
it is often described as done and done and done, done and driven, done and dusted, done and dropped,

310
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:31,739
done and done and dusted? I've never heard that term before, but that makes the most sense.

311
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:38,280
Which of these is an informal word for father? Uh, that would be pop.

312
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:49,639
Okay. Which of these is a brief outline of the plot of a play, film, or book?

313
00:52:49,639 --> 00:53:01,110
That would be the synopsis. Nailed it. Doing well. Okay. That was really fast to a thousand.

314
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:11,530
All my lifelines. I'm ready to go. In which of these carry on films did Kenneth Williams not

315
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:23,980
appear? No idea. If we get to the thousand dollar question and they give this

316
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:34,070
amazingly specific question. We need some help here. Carry on Columbus. I'll, I'll trust them.

317
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:42,170
Okay. All right. No more lifelines unless I absolutely need it. I need to get to 32,000.

318
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:47,050
That's, that's my million. You're going, you're going to make short work of this new question.

319
00:53:47,050 --> 00:54:04,360
Which musical features the song matchmaker matchmaker? I think it's this one, this one,

320
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:11,269
or I don't think it's either of these two. I think it's this one or it's Fiddler on the Roof.

321
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:36,570
It's, it's not either one of these. It's Fiddler on the Roof. Okay. I was half right. What is

322
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:51,989
taffetta, taff, taffetta, taffetta, Italian bread, shiny fabric, sailor's knot or green tea,

323
00:54:51,989 --> 00:55:03,289
taffetta, bread. That's Italian bread. Final answer. I'm sure of it.

324
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:18,820
Shit. I was so confident that it was bread. All right. All right. All right.

325
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:25,300
Did you please play League of Legends trivia? I will not get a single question right.

326
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:38,099
You suck at this. Here's the thing though. This game, I sit there and I've seen people play this

327
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:42,409
and I'm like, man, like I definitely could get farther than that. And then you realize that

328
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:49,579
there's so many questions that this world has posed. It's hard to even get to the, you know,

329
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:54,469
a quarter of a million. It's really hard to do that because you'll get tripped up on a question

330
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:59,670
that is just completely out of your head. It's just never been there. You've never had this

331
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:09,880
information and you never will. When you get one of those, it's just over. But I like it. It's fun.

332
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:20,010
There's so many questions to ponder on this earth. That's right. All right. Let me get to it. I got

333
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:26,329
to get to at least a quarter of a million or that's embarrassing for me. I'm doing this for

334
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:34,260
me at this point. This is for me. I'm getting to at least a hundred thousand. All the person

335
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,820
is dumb as being long in the hair, long in the lip, long in the socks, long in the tooth.

336
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:49,719
Long in the tooth. All right. Speedrun it. Additionally, who was the assistant to the

337
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:57,940
bridge groom on his wedding day? Wait, wait, what was his word? Traditionally, who was the

338
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:09,019
assistant to the bridegroom on his wedding day? Okay. The smartest friend, the oldest brother,

339
00:57:09,019 --> 00:57:19,340
the neatest buddy, the best man. Yeah, sorry. We got to figure out who the smartest friend is.

340
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:26,179
Question who lived in a mansion in Memphis, Tennessee, called Graceland.

341
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:46,789
Besides puppy dog's tails, what are little boys made of? According to the rhyme screws and nails

342
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:59,059
frogs and snails and puppy dog's tails. Is that right? What the fuck are we made of frogs and

343
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:12,539
snails and what and puppy dog's tails? I thought we were atoms and matter and shit. Like what?

344
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:24,980
I guess this would, okay. Frogs and snails. Which of these amounts is equal to a gross?

345
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:38,420
Hold on. Which of these amounts? So what is a gross? Half a monkey. That's not the right answer.

346
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:49,460
I feel like it's this. I don't know. There's a million things in my brain. I think it's three.

347
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:57,610
I'm going for it. I think it's either three or it's a dozen dozen. What the fuck does that mean?

348
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:15,420
Does that mean it's 12 12s? A ton and a half. I'm not confident. I'm not confident. I don't

349
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:21,909
know if I'm confident on this. I might have to get an opinion. I don't know if I can stay with

350
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:29,159
three but I don't know if I want to do dozen dozen whatever. God damn it. It wasn't even

351
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:41,219
close. Why did I want it to be three? In November 2007 a strike by witch workers brought chaos to

352
00:59:41,219 --> 01:00:05,690
the US TV and movie business. Is it screenwriters? Yeah it was screenwriters. 2007 really? I remember

353
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:14,500
that was maybe it was 2007. What should Muslims do between sunrise and sunset during Ramadan?

354
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:36,650
I feel like it's I don't really know. I think it's one of these two. I don't know. I want to

355
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:51,110
say I want to say fast. Why is it pray? It might be pray. I think that's correct. Yeah it is correct.

356
01:00:54,889 --> 01:01:02,980
Okay I think I'm doing pretty well. I want it that way was a hit single for which boy band?

357
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:28,489
Hold on. But was that in sync or the backstreet boys? Damn it.

358
01:01:36,679 --> 01:01:47,690
It's in sync. Fuck I shouldn't have put my first choice. That was my first choice. Damn it. Just

359
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,969
because I thought of a different song doesn't mean that it can't be the same band. I thought

360
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:54,250
of a different song and I was like wait that's backstreet boys. This one has to be in sync.

361
01:01:55,130 --> 01:02:16,780
God damn it. Only 40 neurons. All right let's change it up a little. We'll keep manga. We're

362
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:25,530
going to add geography, history, sports, keep food, and keep culture. Dude go finish Better Call Saul.

363
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:42,300
I know. I know. Trust me I know. Put it on easy. No. How will I ever train my brain?

364
01:02:47,349 --> 01:02:56,260
Which of the following is not one of the mother sauces? Are they asking what's the first sauce

365
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:11,099
ever? Which of these was not one of the first sauces? I don't know dude. I don't know. This

366
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:17,420
I know what Holladay's is. Holladay's I know what Bacchamel is. Bacchamel whatever. I don't

367
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:25,579
I don't know. I don't know what these are. Mornay? I don't I feel like it's Mornay. No

368
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:35,960
Holladay's is you put on fucking eggs. It's Holladay's. It's fucking Holladay's. Holladay's

369
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:44,500
is what? It was Mornay. What is a mother sauce? These are weird questions. That's weirdly worded.

370
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:48,980
I don't know what that's supposed to mean. What the fuck is a mother sauce? What's a mother sauce?

371
01:03:49,539 --> 01:04:07,909
I've never heard that term before in my entire life. You're a fake sauce fan? No I've never

372
01:04:07,909 --> 01:04:14,309
been like. You know what sweetheart? Tonight let's just use a mother sauce tonight. You know

373
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:20,840
what I mean? Do you want ketchup? Yes I want ketchup on my fucking eggs. Yes I like ketchup.

374
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:31,909
I love ketchup. I have a baby. Where? Complete the phrase as cool as a carrot. Are you sure?

375
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:52,570
Which part of a man's suit is most likely to be described as double breasted? What spice is used

376
01:04:52,650 --> 01:05:03,929
in speculus? Again that's another word I've never heard before. Speculous. What is speculus?

377
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:23,050
What spice is used in speculus? What is a food I've never eaten? I don't know. Um what? Who's

378
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:39,989
eaten speculus? What? Cinnamon goes on top of speculus. Take off emote only. What is speculus?

379
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:51,659
Dessert? It's a cookie. It's a cookie. It's a cookie. I don't know either bro.

380
01:05:53,980 --> 01:06:00,380
Where would you normally place a holly wreath during the Christmas holidays?

381
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:10,329
Right on the front door. Around your neck. Uh I don't think so.

382
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:19,780
Let's move on to a whole new question. Who was the only 20th century US president enshrined on

383
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:31,219
Mount Rushmore? Oh god I'm gonna get this wrong. Um I I know it too. I did though here's another

384
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:36,260
thing about playing these games like trivia games. You're a fake American. I know but listen listen.

385
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:41,429
I know the answer to this question but when it's presented to me with other options I go

386
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:46,650
I don't think I know the answer to this question even though I know it's this one. Right? I for

387
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:51,530
some reason it's like wait these there's other options here. You're gonna get this fucking wrong

388
01:06:51,530 --> 01:07:04,650
Jeremy. It ain't it ain't Roosevelt. You're wrong. You seem to be. But it's right. Question coming.

389
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:15,260
All right. Which of these is not a bird? A sand wedge? There's a club in golf.

390
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:30,760
Actually I'm sure of it. Yeah okay. I saw a lot of omega luls and I was concerned for a second.

391
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:38,869
Experienced contestants. You would have got that one wrong. Here's a new question that I hope

392
01:07:38,949 --> 01:07:44,260
won't worry you. Yellowstone National Park covers parts of Wyoming, Idaho,

393
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:49,690
and which other state? I believe it's Utah. Actually wait a minute might be Colorado.

394
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:53,800
Wait wait wait wait hold on think this through. Think this through for a second.

395
01:07:53,800 --> 01:08:08,380
Think this through. Yellowstone. I think it's Utah. I would my initial reaction is either Utah or

396
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:18,659
Colorado. It's Utah. It has to be. It's Utah. It's Utah. It is. I don't want to ask the audience

397
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:28,060
because I have all my lifelines. No I don't. Never mind. It's Utah. It's Utah. I know exactly

398
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:33,100

399
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:40,460
chat. I know what the fuck you're doing. It's Colorado then. I don't know and I'm not gonna

400
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:45,779
pretend to know. I don't. I gotta get it right. Okay we're gonna call. We're gonna call Theo.

Which of these is a sliding effect in music? Um glissando?

406
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:50,520
Educating myself to not know the answer to this question.

01:09:51,079 --> 01:10:02,340
Easy. Is it Cato? Decrescendo. I feel like it's this. I think it's D. Decrescendo. Decrescendo.

408

Sliding effect. Crescendo is. Crescendo is. So what would a decrescendo be?

409
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:19,539
That doesn't make any sense. Um what I just did. I don't think that's right.

410
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:38,359
Give me a new question. I don't care. Which company bought the website YouTube in 2006?

411
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:55,859
This is a $100 question. Least the pressure. Here's a new question. Who gave birth to a baby

412
01:10:55,939 --> 01:11:15,819

416
01:12:03,109 --> 01:12:12,520
Okay well good. Well this new question is now waiting for you to be answered with flying colors.

417
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:20,939
Which footballer wrote the autobiography in 1966 and all that? I don't know. Banks. Jack Charlton.

418
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:27,029
I don't know. In fact I have no idea. I'm literally. I don't have any clue at all.

419
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:52,229
I have no lifelines either. 16 000. Um I have to guess. I'm about to click this one.

420
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:15,340
That's probably wrong. Um. Shit. That was 16. That was 16 000 too. D Crescendo was right.

421
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:23,369
All right. A couple more. A couple more. A couple more. I want to do a couple more. I didn't really

422
01:13:23,369 --> 01:13:27,210
have any other plan tonight. Just kind of hanging out. Maybe we'll jump into a different game.

423
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:33,130
All right. We're going to take geography away. We're going to do entertainment. Arts.

424
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:44,899
Literature. Keep manga. Get rid of sports. Keep history. And we're going to add science.

425
01:13:44,899 --> 01:14:01,350
Go. Just only do food. Dark and Darker is back. That's true but I feel like I want to

426
01:14:02,069 --> 01:14:05,270
get that set up first because it's not on steam right? Don't you have to go

427
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:21,159
do a weird process to get it? Oh no. Science. Yeah. I'm in trouble. Maybe not. Okay.

428
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:35,260
Which of these manga is not classified in the shonen category? Uh it's it's Berserk.

01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,119
What's the name of the small indentation often found in the human cheek?

434
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:22,329

01:15:27,739 --> 01:15:30,699
What's the name of Don? Sidekick.

436
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:52,279

437
01:15:54,229 --> 01:16:02,920
I don't know. It's kind of it's um it's not either one of these. Is it is it Huckleberry Finn?

01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,880
No it's not. It's this one. It's it's this one. It's not Huckleberry Finn.

439
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:24,649
It's this one right here. Complete the title of the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham.

440
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:37,000
I would save me. Neither do I. Okay got all the lifelines. I think we all agree that we can move

441
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,800
on to this new question. How old is Bulma at the beginning of the Dragon Ball adventure?

442

444
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:17,289
just like Dragon Ball 1. I don't know. Some of you are probably freaking out screaming this right now

445
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:24,250
but I genuinely don't have any single fucking idea. And the audience doesn't know either.

446
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:30,409
Um I'm gonna go with the highest voted option. Nobody knows this apparently in this audience.

447
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:40,220
It's 16. Okay got it. I would have not known.

448
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:48,869
Questions follow each other and are not alike. Oh shit and the manga

449
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:58,380
Gun? Gun? What is the heroine's first name? Why is manga on here?

450
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:07,079
Guys I watched Full Metal Alchemist and Attack on Titan. I don't know any of these. Why would I

451
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:23,619

455
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:11,510
I'm choosing D. Wow grandma. Grandma knows more about manga than you do. Damn okay.

456
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:22,729
The game is getting tougher now with this brand new question. Which meat is used in Katsudon in

459
01:19:46,979 --> 01:20:03,960

460
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:18,819

461
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:24,760
Which US president reportedly said the ballot is stronger than the bullet. Why? Who said this?

01:20:39,930 --> 01:21:05,130
it was it Lincoln? Yeah which of these US presidents was born? Leslie King Jr. in 1913.

464
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:36,039
Um Leslie King Jr. Ronald Reagan? Is it Ronald Reagan? I don't know. I want to say it's Ronald

465
01:21:36,039 --> 01:21:43,340
Reagan but I'm afraid to press this button. Look at this. I have still have I have two lifelines

466
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:49,609
and I'm almost at 32. That's a huge deal. I think I'm about to just dump this question because I

467
01:21:49,609 --> 01:22:01,579
don't know. I have no idea. Give me a new question. Just dump it. Diplopia is the technical name for

468
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:13,829
which visual condition? Diplopia. Diplopia. Diplopia. Diplopia. Diplopia. Shit. I feel like

469
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:42,340
it's B. Diplopia. B or well let me think about this. I don't think it's color blindness. Night

470
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:59,020
blindness. Maybe. I don't know what it is. I would I would take plunge and say that it's either

471
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:09,220
double vision or night blindness and I have to use this because it's unfortunate. Oh that's great.

472
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:13,460
Literally the two that I didn't help me at all. You did not help me at all.

473
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,180
So well actually that kind of does help because I feel like it's night blindness.

474
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:27,420
I think that's correct and I have to live with it so. Oh god damn it. I was right. This this this

475
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:32,619
don't give me multiple choice fucking questions. Just ask me. Just ask me because like I was sitting

476
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:36,300
there going double vision. It's double vision. You know I think it's double vision. Diplopia is

477
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:41,100
double vision but what if it's night blindness. I don't know. That's on here. It was really fun

478
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:48,359
don't give me multiple choice. Just ask me what is diplopia and I'll go oh that sounds

479
01:23:49,159 --> 01:24:00,869
red. That sounds like double vision to me and I'll get it right. He is too. I know.

480
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:08,760
But then I saw it. I freaked out. All right. I'll get it here. I almost got to 32.

481
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:30,489
You're a fake eye fan. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to try as hard as I can. Let's go.

01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:26,680
I think the patch is right. I've never seen anybody complete this by the way.

504
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:32,199
I've not seen a single human beat this. I've never seen a person beat this.

570
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:54,460

571
01:36:54,460 --> 01:37:00,569
fall equinox is it the winter equinox is it the spring equinox is it the summer equinox because

572
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:07,510
I mean that would be I just named four but very importantly there's only two there are only two

573
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:13,829
equinoxes there's the winter equinox there's the fall equinox and then there is that's it

574
01:37:13,829 --> 01:37:19,859
because there's only two there are two equinoxes because the equinox only appears twice

575

588
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:32,310
this question is worth it I should have just done it I should have did it it's tea tree I it's tea

641
01:49:04,489 --> 01:49:09,369
so we're gonna do ask the audience they're eight

642
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:25,670
final answer is none is a type of flatbread traditional in which country is cooking okay

643
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:35,960
now this is tough this is tough because I love this stuff but where where is it traditionally

644
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:45,989
what country traditionally is it from Greece India or Turkey I think it's India or Turkey

645
01:49:45,989 --> 01:49:55,619
I'm gonna I I eat this stuff all the fucking time I love none but like where was it original

646
01:49:55,619 --> 01:50:04,600
what was the original or country of origin I'm gonna say India I'm gonna say India but I think

647
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:13,689
it's Turkey and I'm afraid to click this I think I'm gonna have to just go for it and just click

648
01:50:13,689 --> 01:50:18,729
Turkey because that might it's keep saying go for it that's where it's really from and it was India

649
01:50:18,729 --> 01:50:23,529
and this is why multiple choice questions just rip them up because I got I had the question right

650
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:32,010
well it's no big deal I still had a good time I had the question correct but then I'm just

651
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:38,090
sitting there going wait a minute where's the original origin is it Turkey is it India if you

652
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:42,489
just asked me that question if we just were sitting there and you said what country is

653
01:50:42,489 --> 01:50:49,829
non-bread from I'd say India but when you give me four options that could be correct it's over

654
01:50:49,829 --> 01:51:05,859
it's over you're second guessing well that's the whole point of a multiple choice question is to

655
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:13,289
like multiple choice questions throughout history have been the right answers here but we're gonna

656
01:51:13,289 --> 01:51:17,449
fuck with you we're gonna fuck with you on this question because it's gonna be something that

657
01:51:17,449 --> 01:51:33,529
could be correct but fuck you you're gonna get it wrong okay we have faith no more second guessing

658
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:39,300
we're going we're going for it what type of creature is Jerry in the cartoon series Tom and

01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:24,229
Mel Gibson it's definitely Mel Gibson I feel like but his multiple choice bullshit that's the right

662
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:31,750
answer but like but there was just one made for fucking tv movie back in 1982 where Mel Gibson

you thank you that you've released the pressure here's a new question one of the seven wonders

676
01:55:27,689 --> 01:55:39,140
of the ancient world what was the pharaohs of alexandria one of them it's one of the

677
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:55,319
wonders seven wonders um one of these two pharaohs of alexandria I don't know I'm not caught up in my

678
01:55:55,319 --> 01:56:01,819
seven wonders of the world the only thing I ever know about the seven wonders is I just I get a

679
01:56:01,819 --> 01:56:25,579
lot of stuff about Egypt in my youtube shorts uh it's probably temple I have on my lifelines

680
01:56:27,619 --> 01:56:33,140

thanks thanks for making it real easy so how many of you put that here as a joke

682
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:53,289
because I feel like it's actually the right answer pharaohs of alexandria

683
01:56:53,289 --> 01:57:01,449
when in a lighthouse it says a statue it's no there's no way it's a lighthouse

684
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:14,220
it's probably a huge statue whatever the audience doesn't know either so I don't know

685
01:57:18,039 --> 01:57:22,600
it is a lighthouse but it's the game this is not the right answer that feels like the answer

686
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:40,840
that's just god damn it the lighthouse uh I just got an achievement I'm very curious about my time
