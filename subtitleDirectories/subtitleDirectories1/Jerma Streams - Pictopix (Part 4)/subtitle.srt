1
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:49,619
How you doing? Good afternoon. I hope you're having a good day today. I hope you had a good last four or five days.

2
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:59,549
I've been pretty good. It's been kind of a wild couple of weeks, wouldn't you say? This is a normal streamer voice.

3
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,049
Geode Andy, that's me. Geode Andy.

4
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:19,780
500,000 follower Andy, what'd I do? What did that happen? Where do you see that? That's not- no, no, it's not. No, it's not.

5
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,269
I'm at 499.

6
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,879
097.

7
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
499,000.

8
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,799
That's not 500. You just made me celebrate for something that's not even real. Is that a lot?

9
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,480
That's a lot, right?

10
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,540
That's a lot.

11
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,799
500,000 followers? How many subs did I have on YouTube? On the main channel?

12
00:01:51,829 --> 00:02:01,269
700,000? Well, that's a lot. Yeah, that is a lot. Not even seven figures laughing my ass off.

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,299
Hey, we're halfway to seven figures. That's what you meant to say.

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,259
Hey, hey, the glass is half full. Glass is not half. Empty glass is half full.

15
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,449
Now give me some more orange juice or I'm gonna complain to the fucking manager.

16
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,389
So we just gave 10 subs. Hey, Tangie. Hey, Tang Dynasties. Thanks for the 10 subs.

17
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,539
So, um, we have- there's a lot of shit we have to talk about. A lot of things to discuss.

18
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:42,099
I feel like this is like a company update stream. This is like a business update company

19
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,819
newsletter stream. That's what this is gonna be.

20
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,569
First of all,

21
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:54,620
thank you for the insane support on the last stream. That's a number- we broke over 50,000 concurrent viewers.

22
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:59,099
Which that's fucking insane. That's- I can't even- that's a-

23
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:08,030
That's like double what the highest view count I've ever had was. It's remarkable. I can't even- I can't even believe it.

24
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:16,889
And yes, I had- I know we- we were not prepared for the, uh, the enthusiasm, I guess,

25
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,969
for the Grotto Beast stuff.

26
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:24,509
But I know everybody has a ton of questions about Grotto Beast. Like, from every angle, it's like,

27
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:29,469
Hey, hey, tell us more about Grotto Beast. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hit the brakes for a second.

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,370
There-

29
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,650
Just hit the brakes. I know everyone's really excited about it. I can't- we- just give me a few weeks.

30
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,530
Please. I- trust me when I say I want to be screaming about the stuff.

31
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:50,610
But I- we can't- we have to just wait a few weeks. Give me a few weeks. We're still-

32
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,379
I need like a company policy fucking generic PR statement. Where do I get it from?

33
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,849
I need a- I need a generic company PR statement. Let me Google one.

34
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:08,750
Generic PR statement.

35
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:19,139
Okay, let's see. Generic PR statement. We've got to get a good one here, because just- I can't- how do I word this?

36
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,420
What you- when you- how to make a statement to the media?

37
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,459
Free press release template. This one says talk is cheap.

38
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,899
Anyways.

39
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:44,829
Just- just hold off for a little bit. There's tons of projects in the works. There's tons of announcements that I have. Lots of them.

40
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:50,980
There are probably five projects that are in the works, and these are not things you're gonna see a year from now.

41
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,779
This stuff is hitting the ground running, and there's gonna be major, major shit to talk about over the next three weeks.

42
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,339
Which leads me to the next thing we're about to talk about.

43
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:08,259
So because of the amount of projects that are being worked on, and the amount of stuff that's happening- remember, 2020 got all fucked up here.

44
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:15,480
A ton of projects got moved to 2021. I have to get this medical stuff under control. I have to.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,699
It's getting to a point now where there's so many interesting things that are gonna be happening over the next six months.

46
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,000
I have to get a procedure done. I have to do it.

47
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,819
So,

48
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:37,079
I hate- I hate- I hate- I don't want to say it, but I have to. I have to go on another break.

49
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,939
Because I'm gonna be doing a bunch of doctors appointments, and I'm actually gonna try as hard as I can to get a procedure done.

50
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:52,269
I'm probably gonna get injections, whether that's intercostal injections or trigger point injections into my back area, into my chest area.

51
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,389
We have to try a real treatment plan here.

52
00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,870
Because there's too many things going on this year that I have to not be like,

53
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,470
Ah! Ah! Ah, hold on. Yeah, give me a minute. Ah!

54
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,029
I can't- yeah, I gotta sit down for like an hour.

55
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,509
There's too much shit going on. I have to take care of this.

56
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:16,970
So, this is- I'm not gonna go on break for as long as I did last time. Last time was to make sure I didn't have anything

57
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,810
really major or horrible

58
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,029
going on. I spent like two or three months

59
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,990
somewhere in the middle of 2020.

60
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,990
That was to rule out everything that could have been really bad, and we did.

61
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:36,350
So, I came back. I changed my kind of streaming policy. It helped a lot.

62
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:41,829
That like four to six hours instead of like seven to eight hours, it really was helpful.

63
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,769
But now it's time to actually get a- I need- I need to get something done. I have to get a procedure done.

64
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:56,860
So, the next- I would assume probably three weeks, and this is not- this is not three weeks into two months, I promise.

65
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,310
I'm going to go get something done, and I will be back. And I'll be back on-

66
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:12,670
This is not intentional, but you know, I'm- I'm- please, trust me what I say. Me coming back on April 1st is

67
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,660
not like a joke stream. I'm coming back on April 1st.

68
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,740
So,

69
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,420
maybe- maybe I will do something. I don't know. Just keep an eye out.

70
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:27,379
But this whole break is not to have something weird happen on the 1st. Something weird probably just will happen on the 1st.

71
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,519
So, I want to make sure that's out there.

72
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,279
I have a lot of personal stuff. I have a lot of family stuff, and medical stuff.

73
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,800
That- I need- I gotta close the book on this shit. That's TLDR.

74
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,180
Now, what this means for you is,

75
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,339
when I come back,

76
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,240
we're- I probably shouldn't do this on the 1st. I'm gonna have like four announcements.

77
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,680
Like major announcements. I don't- I shouldn't do- should I do that on the 1st of April?

78
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
I feel like people think that was a joke.

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,540
Maybe I'll do it on the 2nd of April.

80
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,069
Okay, so April 2nd, you can expect a bunch of major announcements.

81
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:15,459
So, I'm not gonna do this on the 1st. Save the announcements for after. Do it on the 1st. That'll be funny.

82
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:30,889
It's gonna be wicked funny, but I- let me just- I have to be very clear. I'm

83
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,899
overwhelmed by this shit that you guys have been saying. It's- everyone's been so

84
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,019
supportive. I've seen so much, like- I think at one point,

85
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,740
this stream was trending on Twitter, like number two in the United States.

86
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,549
When I was told that, I was like, you're a liar. That didn't happen. It was a joke. You made that up.

87
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,700
It's like, no. I was getting like sent screenshots and shit. It's like, what the fuck is going on?

88
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,590
And I'm really, really also happy to see that-

89
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,470
that Nevada Science Center. A lot of you guys are supporting

90
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,429
those guys, and they were so, so nice to do that. They put up with a lot of my bullshit.

91
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,419
So, I'm really happy to see you guys are actually supporting them. So, it's really good to see.

92
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,740
So,

93
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,059
TLDR,

94
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,779
tons of major shit that you're gonna hear about on April 2nd. I'll be back on April 1st.

95
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:34,120
I'll see you later. Alright, goodbye. No, I'm just kidding. We're not gonna stop there. We're gonna chill today.

96
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm gonna play Picross, and I'm gonna not answer any questions at all about anything,

97
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,080
because I can't. So, let's just hang out for a while. Just leave already.

98
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,679
Just leave.

99
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,320
No, I can't leave right now. I'm here. I'm right here.

100
00:09:48,840 --> 00:10:02,590
Somebody said that- did somebody say that was a really shitty direct? Can you imagine if that was a direct? Is this-

101
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,190
like, Doug Bowser comes on the screen. He's like, alright, so, I mean, I can't really talk about any of this stuff,

102
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,190
but like, I mean, like, Mario's cool.

103
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,990
We got this Mario guy, and like, I mean, you might see him. Maybe. I don't know. I don't have any fucking idea.

104
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,929
Thanks for all the support, guys, on like, Mario 2.

105
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,570
It's like a 10-minute thing of him just bumbling around, just not answering questions.

106
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:35,049
He's actually- he's like, somebody Google me a generic PR statement in front of, like, a

107
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:44,100
gray-white background where he's just sitting there, like, green-screened in. You're so handsome. I'm not even on screen.

108
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:58,309
Do you think your surgeon will recognize you as the Among Us guy? I hope so.

109
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:05,220
Although, maybe not. I kind of hope not. Don't you feel like he would, like, deliberately kill me?

110
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,980
Oh, you're the Among Us guy. Yeah, that's me. Oh, wow.

111
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:19,649
He's like the, like, the gas and like the, like, the anesthesia's going in. I fucking hate that meme.

112
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:23,399
You're never gonna wake up again. I'm just like,

113
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,259
right before- I gotta get my, I gotta get my last thing out right before I die.

114
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm just right before I go out. I'm like,

115
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,789
that was pretty sus.

116
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:49,139
We get a face cam? No. Why did you moan?

117
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,500
No, that was like, I'm going under from the anesthesia.

118
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,230
Like, nobody- you don't know what sound you make when you're under anesthesia, when you go, like, have surgery.

119
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,909
They make you count back for some ten, and then you just wake up in a bed.

120
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,340
You don't- who knows what you could be- sound you can make, and it's like,

121
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
ugh, or, ooh, or, ugh.

122
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,500
Those of you that have had anesthesia before, you just, like, you're sitting there.

123
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,100
Okay, I'm lying here. I'm ready. I guess I- I guess- I'm- I woke up in a bed. Oh.

124
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:25,100
What happened? Oh, it's done. Oh.

125
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:27,779
All right, weird.

126
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:39,220
Who knows what sound you make? I mean, stop, stop. What? Like, in a hospital.

127
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,250
Don't get too excited that I'm not playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3.

128
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,250
I'm just playing the soundtrack for you.

129
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,279
A lot of people really just got really excited because that's the intro to Heroes of Might and Magic.

130
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,980
It's like, no, we're playing Picross. That's one of the nice OST.

131
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,090
Oh my god, he's gonna minimize and he's gonna be in the next campaign!

132
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:22,159
So we're gonna play Picross and just chill. I can't wait to talk about some of these things.

133
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:31,460
Play- play Heroes. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We'll do that when I- I don't know. I don't know.

134
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,659
We'll do it when I come back.

135
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:40,190
Yeah, what's that now? Let me just get back to- let me- let me figure out how to play this game again.

136
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,820
I think it's a cloud save file.

137
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,629
Let's do this one. Open this one. Can I open this? There we go.

138
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:53,039
So if you don't know how to play Picross, let me show you how it's done. I actually don't- I forget everything.

139
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,139
It's gonna- we're gonna take some learning here. It's been years since the last Picross stream.

140
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:06,500
Um, it's been, I don't know, like maybe like six, eight months? He's doing a tuber voice again.

141
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,299
What are you talking about? What do you mean? I'm not doing a tuber voice right now.

142
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,039
Stop getting in my head. So if you don't know how to play Picross, we'll do a quick TLDR first of all.

143
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,779
So these are squares that need to be filled in. So there needs to be 13 squares filled in on this

144
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,929
column, right? A row is this way. I don't know where they are. I just know there's 13 of them,

145
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:39,169
but I can deduce with logic, reasoning, and skill that I know where these could be, and it makes a picture.

146
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:46,539
Eventually, it makes a picture. Thanks for the tutorial. Everyone knows how to play Picross.

147
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,179
Oh really? Because when I played it a year ago, everyone was like, what is this garbage? Get it off the screen.

148
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:59,059
And then half of you got addicted to it the next day. So let me deduce here. So if this- how many- what is it? 15 by 15?

149
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:10,519
So that means that there has to be- this has to be correct. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

150
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,379
Therefore, these middle ones have to be here. So now we have- we can- we can do some deduction.

151
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:22,169
Or can we? I'm not sure. So only four in this row. Can I do anything- and by the way,

152
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:26,009
but for those of you that have never played this before, if there is a space between numbers,

153
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:32,360
it means there has to be at least one space in between. Has to be. So for instance, if one was

154
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,460
right here, there would have to be a space for the next one. Have to be. That was incorrect.

155
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:46,659
Deduction Andy. Is your mother approved of this game? My mother plays this game, so I'm sure she does.

156
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:56,779
What about color? Color doesn't matter. Is it custom map? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Well, I'm just

157
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:59,659
gonna get back into the swinging things. We'll play the custom ones. We'll go in the workshop.

158
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:08,269
So it's 15. So 8, 9, 10, 11. So that means- hold on, let me see. I always hate when I don't get a

159
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:15,659
bunch of free ones down here. I need the bingo free space down here. 4, 1, 3, 3, 1.

160
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:25,419
This could be the 1. Single 8 means one square in the middle. Yeah, right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

161
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:35,080
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Right, okay. So that has to be where-

162
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:44,360
one of them has to be here. Has to be. Your mom plays this? This is Jeremy's mom playing.

163
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,409
It's pre-recorded. Is this too hard? It's not too hard. Trust me when I say it isn't.

164
00:16:50,940 --> 00:17:00,820
Oh, what have I got? 10 here. 11. 5 and- hmm. The second 8. Oh, where is it? Where is it? Okay, here we go.

165
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,880
Yeah, because that's 8. Has to be 1 here. Then we got these two. This is part of the 5.

166
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:17,440
Has to be right. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I wonder. 3 and the 8. Oh, here we go. Yep.

167
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Right, right, right. This is the 2. Alright, bingo. So check this out. See what we have just deduced?

168
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,539
Do you see what we just deduced? This has to be that 2. Block it off. There's your 2.

169
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:39,039
Now, 1 is somewhere over here. Are you guys excited about this yet?

170
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,839
Then that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This has to be right here. So this is part of the 1.

171
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:59,099
Check that out. This is one of the 1s. Because it can't be 1 here. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

172
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:05,900
You got it. You're understanding it. I'm gonna drop a deuce. He-he-he-he-he. Alright, that's funny.

173
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:17,150
That's wicked funny. Did you catch the game last night? Did you have any hot fudge sundaes?

174
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:28,079
What grade are you in school? The brain hurts. Flap, flap. Let's go, let's go. This is a boomer game.

175
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah, well, I just told you I wanted to relax today. I wanted to tell you about some of the important

176
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,950
projects going on and the fact that I'm literally taking a 3-week break. Alright, what do I do?

177
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,470
Okay, I know I gotta tell them I'm like, I'm like taking like medical leave again. Oh, what?

178
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,059
Should I, should I play Picross for like a few hours and like tell them I'm leaving? Oh shit,

179
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:55,309
hold on. Wait a minute. This is important. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Bingo. Check this out.

180
00:18:55,309 --> 00:19:01,809
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It's got to be like here. It has to be here. This is part of the

181
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:12,289
four. It has to be somewhere in here, the five. Bingo. Tell mom to stream in your absence.

182
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:19,019
I would, my mother would take one second on the stream and look over and be like,

183
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:28,180
son, why do you do this? Why? Did you see what they were saying? And I'd be like, ma, ma, ma,

184
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:34,980
money. It's not, what do you mean money? I didn't raise you like that to care about money.

185
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:42,269
Be like, ma, ma, just, just relax. I'm making money. No, no, you're supposed to do it because

186
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:48,299
you love it and you love doing it. No, no, no. Oh, remember when you first made your first

187
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:53,329
YouTube video, how much you thought that was fun and how you were just doing it for fun.

188
00:19:53,329 --> 00:20:03,420
Yeah, time to change, ma. No, not the son that I made. Ma, ma, get out of here, ma. You don't get

189
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:12,980
it. No, my son. And then I have a really deep realization like in like 45 minutes later in the

190
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,599
movie and I like understand now and I go back to like, like how I began and I like do it because

191
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:27,380
I love it. That's after I throw her in the volcano. By the way, just want to make sure you guys

192
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:39,500
understand where we are in the movie. Spoilers. All right, let's keep going. Let's get, we got to,

193
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,390
we got to deduce this. So this is part of the four. So if, okay, hold on. So this is the part

194
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,680
of the four. That means it has to be two ones after this. That means it would have to be,

195
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,069
it'd have to be this, right? This has to be where it is because there's no way this,

196
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:00,029
the four will fit. So this has to be the four. There you go. These are done. Pretty cool. Now

197
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,710
here we go. Perfect deduction. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Oh my God,

198
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,109
I'm sorry. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me. It's supposed to be a winding down

199
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:13,660
hangout stream where I tell you them. All right. So one, two, three, four. It cannot possibly be

200
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,779
higher than that. And it also cannot possibly be lower than this. Two, three, four. So here you go.

201
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:27,170
Ain't nothing over here, but it could be up here. This is also has to be part of the four. Therefore

202
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:35,539
one, two, three, four, nothing. It can't be over here. One, two, three, four. It could be

203
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:45,440
there, right? Technically. This is where it gets interesting. So this is part of the three,

204
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:53,009
the one, two, three, or one, two, three. This has to be the second three because one, two, three,

205
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,470
even if it was this way. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. It could be that. I don't know that

206
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:07,759
for certain. I can't be certain of that. I'm too dumb to understand this. Do the eight column.

207
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,940
Oh, right. We've got some more info here and here. So this has to be part of the eight.

208
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,859
I guess it doesn't have, what does it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. It does.

209
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:23,839
Okay. Does that give us any more info here? This is either two or the three.

210
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:31,940
This is the two. I feel like I'm in a zoom meeting, zoom class.

211
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:52,289
You know what? That is the worst insult ever. That's such an insult. Like it just is.

212
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:57,039
That's a perfect insult. You didn't say this stream sucks. You didn't say like, oh wow,

213
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,799
this is kind of boring. You said this is like a zoom meeting, dude. And it's like, that's

214
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:09,680
the worst thing where you could have described this at all as the teacher. All right. So let's

215
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,359
see. One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five could also go down here.

216
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:21,660
Yeah. We can do this one down here as well. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Therefore.

217
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:30,529
So these are good. One, two, three. Okay. So this is part of the two, which means this is

218
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:37,259
probably done. Yeah. That's definitely the two, which therefore this is gone. This has to be the

219
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:43,309
two, right? There's no way this is the three. This has to be the two. Look at how much we're

220
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:48,019
learning here. No, no, wrong, wrong, wrong. No, no, no. What do you mean? What, what, what?

221
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:55,279
Wait, wait, wait. What are you talking about? What's wrong? One, two, three, four, five.

222
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:01,819
One, two, three, four, five. Yeah. It could be, it has to be these three. I had it right.

223
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:10,369
This could be the five. Oh, wait. You're right. Because this could be like that. I see what you

224
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:17,019
mean. Okay. Yeah. Actually, I don't know that info. You're right. This is, this is not, this is the

225
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:22,109
three. Because there's no way this is the five. This is definitely part of the three.

226
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,880
So if it was one, two, three, there you go. Bingo. Okay. I don't know that for certain yet.

227
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:40,849
This teacher sucks. There are 12,000 people here. Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm, we're doing a,

228
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:47,250
but yeah, welcome everybody. All right. Where else can I go here? Can't do anything in here.

229
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:53,940
Or can I? Make a sentry noise so they don't leave. Well, if they're going to leave,

230
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,660
they're going to leave. I can't, I can't tell them, but they have to stay here.

231
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,819
You better not leave. Just make that really clear. Better not. What do you mean? Well, what if I

232
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:12,930
leave? Well, then you're going to miss something huge in the next 10 minutes. I'm going to play my

233
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:18,180
own Picross game so I don't get the urge to yell at you. Yeah. Pull it up, man. Let's go. All right.

234
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,660
Let's go down over here. So this is part of the five. There's a one over here somewhere.

235
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,849
Or one, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

236
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,339
two. It could be either this way or this way. And it could be these two as well.

237
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:47,410
This is one of the threes. It could be either side because this is part of the three or the four.

238
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:54,000
Damn it. What about this eight? One. Oh yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

239
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Cause we, we made some more room here. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

240
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:09,150
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh shit. All right. Look at that.

241
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:20,380
We shaved off some space here. This is the five and the other eight as well. Can I do that though?

242
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,779
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,

243
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:33,859
seven. I don't have enough info for that. I don't think you dismiss us already. No, you're stuck here.

244
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:43,200
Well, I can do this though. So this is the three, which means one, two, three has to be here.

245
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:55,619
That's one, two, three, one, one, two, three, or one, two, three. Therefore this has to be one,

246
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,160
two, three, one, two. I don't know the info on that yet. Nevermind. I don't have the info.

247
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:11,299
The bell rang. Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats. All of you have detention now.

248
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:16,380
Every single person in the room in the class has detention. All of you. None of you are going

249
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,990
anywhere. You all have detention. Teacher, I'm hungry. No snacks allowed in my classroom either.

250
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:41,180
Bell doesn't dismiss us. Jerma does. I need to go to the bathroom. Well, sorry. The weird key

251
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:48,849
attached to the giant wooden plank that has the bathroom key on it is out right now. You're gonna

252
00:27:48,849 --> 00:28:01,740
have to wait till Jerry comes back. All right. Let me focus. This is part of the five. I need

253
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:14,430
the top one here. I'm going to beat Jerry up. Well, now you're suspended. Not only do you have

254
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:20,720
detention, now I'm suspending you. Five. All right. Fuck. Pay attention. It's been a while

255
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:31,859
since I played Picross. I gotta get this right. Three, two, three, five. I feel like I can do

256
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:42,269
something here. One, two, three. Okay. I can do that. Oh, wait. Hold on. Yep. We can do this too.

257
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:49,819
Yep. All right. So here we go. Look at that. There's no way it could be eight here.

258
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:54,900
There's no way it could be. Yeah. Okay. So let's let's go over here. So we have one, two, three,

259
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:02,670
four. One, two, three, four. Fuck. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four,

260
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:17,009
five, six. There it is. Six. There it is. Oh, there it is. Genius. The picture sucks. Well,

261
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:22,400
you don't even know what it is yet. You can't know that yet. What does that do here? This has to be

262
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,180
the three. So it needs to be one, two, three, or one, two, three. Well, that's the only thing

263
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:36,450
I can deduce from there. Now this is part of the four. So one, two, three, four. Sorry. It ain't

264
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:45,410
there. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay. Teacher, I have to go. I have to go

265
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:58,480
to the bathroom. Look. Do you all have to go to the bathroom? Everybody has to go to the bathroom?

266
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,059
Well, I don't know how. There's how many stalls and how many urinals are in the bathroom? I don't

267
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:13,940
know. Jerry's vaping. I can see. Oh, Jerry's vaping. I can see him out the window. He's out

268
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:21,789
there like behind one of the trees outside the school vaping. Oh, no. What's he doing? What's

269
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,150
he doing? Oh, no. He's spinning around. He's spinning around. He's got the wooden key to the

270
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:32,900
bathroom. Oh, he just threw it up on the roof. You little shit. He's running. He's gone. He's

271
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:39,170
taken. Someone's going to call his mom. Okay. Um, well, let me, let me come over here and call the

272
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:45,660
janitor. Pick up the phone. Pick up the office phone. Yeah. We're going to need the janitor to

273
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:53,279
come down here. We need another key to the bathroom. Jerry, you always, you always just making

274
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:03,980
trouble. Okay. So where are we? Eight. I do any more here? I think, yeah, I can. The same exact

275
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:14,670
thing. Ooh, I did it. That's a three. Four is part of the five. Wiggly. Oh my God. I'm not even

276
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:21,119
paying attention. I'm getting so many subs. What the? Don't swear. Stop swearing. Oh my God.

277
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:32,859
Imagine, look, people stream themselves doing all kinds of wild shit. Imagine a teacher streaming

278
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:40,910
and like thanking subs in the middle of the class. Hey, nuclear waffle. Thanks for the 25 community

279
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:47,970
subs. It cutesy. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Lone K five community subs. Tank top typhoon,

280
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:55,650
five community subs. AWP five community subs. 25 community subs from Wiggly Joe. 25. Thank you.

281
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:04,849
Anyways, Genghis Khan, when he claimed, when he took over China, he was,

282
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,809
all right, guys, I got some subs. So give me a minute. You would never learn anything in that

283
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:19,440
classroom. Nothing. It would just be the teacher shouting out subs. That was a recycled doctor

284
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,119
joke. There's a bunch of new people here. I can recycle old material like a doctor doing surgery.

285
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:35,619
Okay. So the sick, the row of six, take a look at this. This is really interesting. Those of you

286
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:41,390
that don't know how to play this game. So I have blocked off places where there's no way it could

287
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,950
be six. There's not enough space for it. So it has to be down here. Therefore one, two, three, four,

288
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,630
five, six. You love when that happens, don't you? Don't you just love when that happens?

289
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:56,509
The row is done here and now we have more info. So if you understand this, now this has to be

290
00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:02,109
one of the fours. Take a look at that. Absolutely clean. This is the three over here. So this has

291
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:07,069
to be part of the five. Really cool. Really, really cool that we're able to deduce that,

292
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:13,630
deduce that. This is part of the four. Therefore one, two, three, four, can't be over here. One,

293
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,190
two, three, four, can't be over here. What does that do for us here, folks? What does that do for

294
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:28,849
us here, class? What are you doing? How long does this bit last? This is not, there's no bit. I'm

295
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:38,140
playing pick-ross. You hate Tetris, but love this. Yes, because I have more than three seconds to

296
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:44,059
make a decision. I can turn away from the computer screen and talk over here about a

297
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,579
12-year-old shot putting a bathroom key under the roof and I didn't lose the game.

298
00:33:50,299 --> 00:34:02,609
What are you talking about? All right, so that's done. No new info here. It probably is. No,

299
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:08,190
it's not. Oh, it can't be here. Look at this. Nice. Okay, cool. Cool. All right, now we've got more

300
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:13,230
info. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Take a look at that.

301
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:20,880
You've got your two. Now you've got your two and this is done because this has to be here.

302
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:34,000
That's not done. It doesn't know how to pause Tetris. You can pause Tetris. One, two, three,

303
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,329
four. One, two, three, four. Okay, can't do anything else here. One, two, three, four. One,

304
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:48,750
two, three, four. That's the five, right? There it is. All right, so now one, two, three, four, five.

305
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,869
One, two, three, four, five. Has to be here or here. Did that give us anything? There's the three

306
00:34:53,869 --> 00:35:00,000
right there. Bingo. Got it. This is also part of the three. Can't be here. There's your three.

307
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:08,699
Done. Got it. Oh, speeding up. He's speeding up. He's getting on the freeway. Four. One, two, three,

308
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:17,170
four. Here we go. Take a look at that. I'm on a roll. X more things out. Oh, let me see. What

309
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:29,090
can I X out? Can't do this. Three, two, one. This has to be the two, right? Right? Yeah,

310
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:36,219
has to be. Get rid of that. Five and two. This could be one, two, three, four, five. Space one,

311
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:54,940
two. Can't decide that one yet. 13, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

312
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:08,769
13, 13. Okay. What the fuck is this? Isn't it not a stream game title? Why have you asked that?

313
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:14,880
Can't you? It's a stream title. It says it's wind down Andy and then it says playing

314
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:26,500
PictoPix. He's very sassy today. No, I'm faux sassy. No, it doesn't mean anything. One, two, three,

315
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:34,239
four. One, two, three, four. Oh, there's your one. I love when that happens. Joe Biden raid.

316
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:51,170
What the heck? Oh my God. Why do you X? I couldn't even read it. I don't even know what he said.

317
00:36:54,179 --> 00:37:00,079
That's like funny about doing the big stream from like four days ago. Is there people that probably

318
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,519
that's the first time they'd watch the stream and they're like, whoa, what the heck? That was really,

319
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,280
that was really cool. I wonder what the next stream is probably going to be something.

320
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,000
It's pick cross. I'm just sitting here pick cross like yelling at my students in my fake classroom

321
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:22,400
and then I leave for three weeks. I got the most follows I think in one day, four days ago,

322
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,159
and I'll get the most unfollows a week from now when I haven't streamed. But whatever, you know,

323
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:45,809
like if you try the lasagna, it's my favorite. Here it is. Thirteen is done. That means I can't

324
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:52,699
do that one. Oh, one, two, three, four. One, two. Walk it off. Walk it off. Walk it off.

325
00:37:54,110 --> 00:38:06,219
Four. One. That's done. Here's your four right here. One, two, three, four. Can't be here. Yeah,

326
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:16,179
like ice cream sundaes. One, two, three. Can I do this one? There's three. There's three.

327
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:22,019
Okay, let's do some cleanup here. I love this game. It's the most relaxing and fun thing ever.

328
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,139
Take out these whole rows. I'm going to assume it's probably here.

329
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:34,179
All right, that would be clean. We don't know that yet. What even is this picture?

330
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:42,909
It's like a swan or something. Don't guess. Four, four. Oh, here's the four.

331
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:50,340
What even is this thing? Three, six. Okay, we have our info here. One, two, three, four, five, six.

332
00:38:51,380 --> 00:39:04,179
One, two, three, four, five, six. Cool. All right, does that do any worse? That's three and one.

333
00:39:04,179 --> 00:39:09,889
We're looking for a two and a one over here. What about this five? One, two, three, four, five.

334
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,730
Got that one. This is part of the two. One, two. It has to be one, two here. It can't be up here.

335
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:23,489
Does that help us do anything else? Maybe a little. Here's three. Could be here. Could be here.

336
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:37,409
Don't guess. Do something funny, sus streamer. There's another one done. Suss. All right,

337
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:41,809
what else we got? That's two. Oh, here we go. Lock that off because the two is already done.

338
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:46,750
There's your six. There's your one. Done. There's your four. Done. There's your six.

339
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,840
Okay, there's your three. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It can't be

340
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:03,090
these two. It's that one. There's your one. Now we need a two. It's got to be one there.

341
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:21,760
Please pee your pants and piss yourself when you beat the level. Oh, that was weird. Okay,

342
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,719
we're almost done. I have no idea what this image is, but we're almost done with it.

343
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:33,599
One, two, three. One, two, three, eight. All right, this row is done. I didn't even mean to

344
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:46,059
do that, but we did it. One, two, three, four, five. One. Nice. Okay, that clears out this row.

345
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:53,099
There's four here. It's four down here. Eight. There's one somewhere here. One there.

346
00:40:54,139 --> 00:41:05,340
Hold on. One, two, three, four, five. What did that do? It gave me something else. It's eight.

347
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,530
Eight, two. Bingo. There's a two. And there's your eight. I keep saying in there's your.

348
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,420
Oh, and there's your two. There's your eight. There it is. We got that. There's that one.

349
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:20,239
There's your two. There's your six. There's your five. I need something more interesting to say.

350
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:34,179
All right. Oh, we're done. Done. This is done. Is that? What picture is this? What is it?

351
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,550
It's a squirrel. It's a squirrel. It's a squirrel with a big tail. Oh, wow. I thought it was a swan.

352
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:54,320
That was cool. You know, I did see people say squirrel. Blue star. Better than one.

353
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,519
There's your two. There's your three. There's your four. There's your two.

354
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:12,619
All right. What about this one? Oh, all right. Well, this one. Oh, that's interesting.

355
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:21,139
This one's got some. This is 15. Maybe we can go in here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

356
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:28,719
eight, nine, ten, eleven, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Cool. So the nine then

357
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:35,329
is like in here, right? That's accurate. Seven is right in the middle. Or maybe not. I don't

358
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:44,539
know. I don't have that info. Nightgerma, enjoy the break. Thank you. I'm going to try to do as

359
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:49,250
much as I can. A lot of stuff going on. And I want to make sure I make this clear again,

360
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,449
because a lot of new people trickled in from the beginning of the stream about 40 minutes ago.

361
00:42:52,929 --> 00:43:00,139
Um, let's make this as short as we can. Tons of stuff in the works, stuff I can't talk about.

362
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,489
I have a lot of major announcements when I come back. Leaving to take care of some personal

363
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:10,210
family and medical things once and for all, trying to close the book on that medical shit.

364
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,139
Going to try to get a procedure as fast as I can in this month. Reason for that is because

365
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:21,809
there's so much stuff going on in the next six months that I have to get it under control. So,

366
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:24,380
and if I don't, then it's going to be a real pain in the ass for me.

367
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:32,909
Well, I'll be back on April 1st. And no, that's not a joke. I will be streaming on April 1st and

368
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:36,670
April 2nd. I will give the announcements on April 2nd because I can't do it on the 1st,

369
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,500
because then people are going to think it was made up and it was a joke. I'll be back on April 1st.

370
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:51,199
And hopefully by then I would have had a procedure to deal with this costochondritis

371
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,019
disc spinal problem. We have no idea. We're still trying to figure out exactly what that is,

372
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:01,139
but at least I can get some injections to stop it from happening. Stop the

373
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:09,500
pain from showing itself all the time. That's the idea. Early April fool's pick raw stream.

374
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,139
Oh, I hope so. Okay. Here we go. This is part of the four. This is part of the two.

375
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:17,099
This is part of the four. This is part of the 11. This is part of the nine. This is part of the

376
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:30,659
part of the, ah, okay. This is part of the, let's do it one at a time. One, two, three, four.

377
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:40,349
This is part of the four. Sorry. Seven. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. One,

378
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:49,380
two, three, four, five, six, seven. That's some new deduction. Does that give us anything here?

379
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,769
We've got the one. Um, I don't, this might not be part. I don't know if that's part of the one.

380
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:05,730
This could be part of the three. That could be part of the three. The one column. I mean,

381
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:25,619
no, the one middle column one. Oh, right. I see what you mean. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

382
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:36,099
You're going to do a health updates on Twitter. I will. If there is a procedure I'm going to do,

383
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:41,360
I will tell you exactly what it is and exactly what that recovery time will be on it. But

384
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,760
make no mistake about it. I'm ready to close the book on this. It's been like three years.

385
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:57,789
And although I was fine after the geode archaeology stream for like three days plus

386
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:04,269
after that, it was tight. It was sore. And I'm just like, I have like, I have to get more.

387
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:17,940
We got to do something about this. Like now he has big balls. Um, why? Just, just, just,

388
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,139
just deny that. Just say, stop. No, why? I'm not talking about this. What the fuck am I doing?

389
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:28,989
Listen, who doesn't, what the fuck's happening? Just say that was weird. Don't say that there.

390
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:34,429
There you go. That was weird. Don't say that done. I'm done. I don't know. Why do I have to like

391
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:40,239
reply to that? Like just, that was weird. Don't say that done. Where are we going? Here we go.

392
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:52,059
This is the, what I was trying to do before. I love this. This, this sounds like really scary.

393
00:46:53,570 --> 00:47:00,800
It could be that way or one, two, three, four, five. Hmm. Okay. You guys taking guesses of what

394
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,269
this is? I'm going to say it's a boat. I think this is a boat with the eight. Yep. Hold on.

395
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:14,210
One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hold on a minute. One,

396
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:19,650
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Damn. Okay.

397
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:30,800
What do we got here? It's a toy boat. It could be, yeah, it is a toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

398
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,159
toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat,

399
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:42,860
toy boat, toy boat. I, the music playing in my ear distracted me. It's a crab. I don't think it's a

400
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:51,980
crab. I think it's a boat. Hmm. Three or the eight. Probably the eight because then this would make

401
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,170
sense, right? This would be the four. Well, this is a guess. I know you're not supposed to do that

402
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:12,639
here, but I'm using enough reasoning to do this. I know you're not supposed to do that. I did it

403
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:24,579
anyways. Song is pretty scary. Mad. It's wrong. Okay. All right. All right. We're fine. Um, so

404
00:48:24,579 --> 00:48:30,500
this is still eight. Any more? This is part of the three, three, five, one, two, three, four, five,

405
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:38,659
one, two, three, four, five. I can't do anything else here. Three, four, five, three, three, four,

406
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:48,210
five. Can't do anything with these ones either. Um, what about this row? I've been listening to

407
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,050
the Heroes of Might and Magic three soundtrack because it's one of the best. Oh my God. What

408
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:59,170
was it? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh shit. This was done. Oh man. Nice. Okay. Maybe it's not a

409
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,059
boat. Um, it's got really nice soundtrack and it's one of my favorite old PC games. So that's why

410
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:15,599
it's out here, man. Working with uncertain information. Yeah. I know. What does that do?

411
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:24,670
Oh, that helps a lot actually. Cause now that brings this in. I can add to this, can't I?

412
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,139
Okay. Added this, which is part of the five. Very nice.

413
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,420
With all this, cause there's no five there. Three can't fit in there. The seven can't fit in there,

414
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,900
but a seven can go up this way for sure. And that one is now done. That takes care of the seven.

415
00:49:45,619 --> 00:50:07,119
It sounds like mouth sounds. We need mouth sounds. Two can't go here. Oh, hold on. One, two, three,

416
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,570
four. All right. What do we got here? This is, these could be the, I think these are the two ones,

417
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:19,139
or this could be the two, could it? Two, one, one, three. This is, this, this is possible to be the

418
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:41,119
two. I don't know that yet. Three, four, five, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Nice. Okay.

419
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:50,539
This is one, two, three, four. Everything else is done. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait a minute. One, two,

420
00:50:50,539 --> 00:51:00,380
three. Whoa. Oh, this is wrong. What happened? Oh shit. What happened? This is wrong. This is wrong.

421
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:16,699
Oh, this is all fucked up. Is it because I guessed? No, is it? Wait, hold on. I need to

422
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:32,619
backtrack a little bit. What happened here? Seven, four, eight. Let me get this one. Let me,

423
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:42,190
let me get this one. So this means, this row is the problem somehow, or this one.

424
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:57,420
This is why you don't guess. I can salvage it though. Hold on. I think this is still correct

425
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:04,800
though. It kind of has to be. One, two, three, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

426
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:18,829
Start over. No, what do you mean start over? One, two, one, two, hold on. Relax. One, two, three,

427
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:25,409
four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five.

428
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:39,710
All right. Five, one, three. Eleven, two, one, one, three. Two, one, one, three.

429
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:49,679
It's been 10 minutes. You should be done by now. You're, you're, whatever. You're in detention

430
00:52:50,480 --> 00:53:05,840
or something. I don't know. That's guessing. No, no, no, no, no, no. What did I just do? One,

431
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:13,360
two. Where was it? Over here. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. This is

432
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:35,699
right, right? Five, one, three. That was a guess. Column three and four. You can eliminate a lot

433
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:51,179
on the second row. Yeah, I can. That's eight. One, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five,

434
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:58,539
six, seven, eight. It has to be there, right? And then this is one, two, three, one, two, three,

435
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:10,289
four. Let's make, is this, do we got this right? Hey, do, do we got this? There's nine. Hey, do we

436
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:16,030
got this? Guys, I think we got this. None of you are clicking on the screen at all. It's me doing

437
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:32,909
this. Oh, we're so close. It's just me doing this. I think I fixed it. Okay. I, these, this is very

438
00:54:32,909 --> 00:55:02,300
right to be wrong. I'll be honest with you. Fuck. Shit. One, two, three, four, five. Oh no, it's all

439
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:35,460
wrong. It's a bunny rabbit though. It's not a bunny. Where did this go so wrong? I did, it's this,

440
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,980
this junk here in the middle is what's good. Everything's good. This is correct over here,

441
00:55:38,980 --> 00:56:18,380
I think. Shit. Five, one, three, something right here. Ah, no. It's cause I guessed on the one

442
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:28,739
educated guess and it fucked up the whole thing. I think it's, it's like one column is wrong.

443
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:34,659
I can salvage it. I know I can. Everything needs to be shifted like one square to the right.

444
00:56:35,380 --> 00:57:06,769
I think this one's wrong. That'd be one. There's one. Okay. One, four, four. Hold on. Hold on. Four,

445
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:16,130
five. Oh, I have to fucking restart the whole thing. I have to restart. I've messed, I just

446
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:22,719
fucked something up. And when you mess one thing up, the whole project is over. Shit.

447
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:39,409
I hate it. I hate it. All right. All right. I still want to, I want to do another one. I just

448
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:54,670
fucked the whole thing up. I fucked everything up. Is that nine? One, two, three, four, five,

449
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,750
six, seven, eight, nine. All right. See if I was lying in my bed doing this shit, I would just like,

450
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:15,659
I would just go, oops. And restart it like five times. Four, eight, eight, three, four, five,

451
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:26,860
six, seven, eight. Okay. Relax. Two, three, four, five. Two, three, four, five. That looks good.

452
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:31,789
You only, you don't, you cheated the, can you explain this more? Sure. I actually will. Because

453
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:36,420
then a lot of people were not here the last time I played this. So the whole goal here is to make

454
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:42,719
a picture. I'm giving some information. By the way, this game is way cooler than Sudoku.

455
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:49,920
So if I'm sorry, but Sudoku is shit in comparison to this. But if you've played Sudoku,

456
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,300
it's about numbers on the edges that you have to fill squares in. This one, you have to make a

457
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:01,860
picture. Each one of these rows and columns has this many squares filled in on this space here.

458
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:12,139
So in this row, there is five in a row, one, and three in a row. In between these three numbers,

459
00:59:12,139 --> 00:59:21,019
there has to be one full unoccupied space. Has to be. And the idea is you have to logically deduce

460
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:27,659
where those squares are filled in based on the knowledge they give you. At least one. Yes,

461
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:32,860
yes, at least one. It could be one, it could be five spaces. Has to be at least one space.

462
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:41,119
Sudoku is sick as fuck. Oh, we have some Sudoku people in here that think that Sudoku is better

463
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:47,969
than Picross. Yeah, hey, hey, hey, back to the Sunday newspaper, right, Grandpa?

464
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:56,940
Hey, how's that Lady Superstar on a Foxtrot, Grandpa and the Funnies?

465
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:16,420
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I can't deduce that. It was a really weird laugh too.

466
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:21,139
I'm sorry about that. Okay, so no more guessing. Get this right. Don't be an idiot.

467
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:39,260
You're a boomer for even knowing what Foxtrot is. Why? Six column, the six column,

468
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:48,050
six column, the six column. I thought this was, okay, hold on. Three, four, five, six.

469
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:55,300
One, two, three, four, five, six. Very cool. All right, so this is where I got screwed up last time.

470
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:01,300
This has to be part of the five. One, two, three, four, five. Let's just say it's right here. One,

471
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:10,699
two, three, four, five, space one, space one, two, three. This is not part of the three. It's

472
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:22,860
part of the five. Tell me I'm wrong here. One, two, three, four, five. This has to be the five.

473
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:36,909
That's good to know. That's not a guess. That's not a guess. Okay, let's keep going. Doing that

474
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:50,260
allows me to go like this. One, two, three, four, five. That's a correct move. Yeah. You're at 500,000?

475
01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:56,179
I'm not at 500,000. It might happen this stream, and if it does, then oh my God,

476
01:01:56,179 --> 01:02:02,590
you're going to hit me celebrate. You're not doing this fast enough to satisfy my satisfaction.

477
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:17,599
Wait, did I read that right? Okay. Stop. Stop. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

478
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:37,619
five, six, seven. Thank you. Correct. Correct. All right, I'm slowly deducing.

479
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:50,739
Hmm. Five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. All right. Okay. This is where it got

480
01:02:50,739 --> 01:02:55,780
messed up last time. I'm not at 500,000 yet. I have a monitor right here that shows it.

481
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:05,019
We're at 499,576. I have the live real-time data. You're not. No, I'm not. Refresh the page.

482
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:25,389
I don't have 500,000 followers. I have 499,576. Debated. That's actually really cool.

483
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:30,510
Weren't we just talking about how I passed 200,000 like six months ago or something?

484
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:36,940
What's happening? All right. This is where I got messed up last time. I just made it an assumption.

485
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:52,530
Three, four, five, space one. It's probably right here, right? I mean, come on. Come on, right? It

486
01:03:52,530 --> 01:04:01,099
has to be. That's a guess, but that is a really good guess. That's assuming. It has to be there.

487
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:06,400
It can't be anything else. That's not an assumption. That is a deduction from logical reasoning.

488
01:04:10,219 --> 01:04:27,389
No, it has to be there. There's nowhere else it can be. No, I can see a real-time clicker,

489
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:35,230
a ticker of what I have for subs right now. No, I mean, for 500,000 subs. Oh, my God.

490
01:04:35,949 --> 01:04:48,099
It rounds up. No, I'm at 499,600. That would be a billionaire.

491
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:56,619
Okay, so that was solved. I got that fixed from last time. One, two, three. One, two, three. There

492
01:04:56,619 --> 01:05:03,340
you go. Therefore, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. I got that done.

493
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:13,889
Is it crack time yet? I think it's been crack time since the stream started like an hour ago.

494
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:21,619
I blew this one too. I blew it. Now we go for it. That was the problem. I knew it was something

495
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:24,420
right here in the middle that you have to start over so you can see what the hell is going on.

496
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:37,780
Very cool. Now I got this. Okay, now I did this. It can't be there. These are ones that can't be

497
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:47,139
played. They can't be done. I just lost 100 followers. I think something you guys don't know.

498
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:56,239
I'll tell you right now. There's so many people are coming and going on this stream. It's really

499
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:00,500
weird to look at. Would you guys like to know how many people unfollowed the stream?

500
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:09,010
Three days ago. Where can I see that info? I know I can see it. Can I?

501
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:25,619
It was unfollowed. I know I can see it. I'm unfollowing right now. The music is fitting.

502
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,539
I don't have the data right in front of me. Just to let you know, hundreds of people potentially

503
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:38,059
unfollow a day. I don't even know who they are. I don't know where they came from. I have no idea.

504
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:43,179
Well, I don't know. Hundreds of people follow and hundreds of people unfollow every day.

505
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:52,559
It's something like that. What's the noise? I don't know. My window's open. There's crickets

506
01:06:52,559 --> 01:07:02,739
and shit out there. There's also a full band out there too. Pretty nice though. I'm going to keep

507
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:16,289
the window open. All right, let's keep going. This is much better. Okay. Now, no guessing.

508
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:28,289
It's definitely not there. Three. It can't be there. It could be here and it could be here.

509
01:07:28,929 --> 01:07:34,380
Four. One, two, three, four. Yeah. Is it there already? Okay. One, two, three, four. Can't be

510
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:41,599
there. Three, four. Okay. One, two, three, four. Can't be here. One, two, three, four. Can't be

511
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:48,369
there either. Interesting. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Which gave us this. Which

512
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:58,800
gave us the seven which means we can do one two three four five six seven one two three four five

513
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:15,860
six seven okay no guessing it's the audio this is outside why are you playing a math game

514
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:29,229
we can't hear you all right it's time to ost change it up sure how about um how about super

515
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:45,649
mario world foe ost this is what was i just doing i was right here this is okay three has to be one

516
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:51,489
here that's that there can't be any more we just got this nice good deduction jeremy you did a

517
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:59,100
fucking fantastic job people should be so proud of you but this is part of the six one two three

518
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:08,050
four five six done now wait slow down i get dmc8 from super mario music i don't think that's gonna

519
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:14,689
happen isn't like video game music in a weird area where it's like you're safe from dmca because

520
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:28,180
it's video game music as long as it's not like a licensed record label song right what if i was

521
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:36,930
playing super mario yeah this is fine look if i get in trouble for playing super mario music on

522
01:09:36,930 --> 01:09:43,579
a twitch.tv video game website stream what the hell am i doing what the fuck are we doing here

523
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:51,279
like what what was the point of live streaming like what was the point of streaming video games

524
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:57,149
if we what are we i'm gonna have to have a stenographer come in and just like give you a

525
01:09:57,149 --> 01:10:01,390
live i'll just like tell you what i'm doing like i said i'll just be like on a webcam and i gotta

534
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:44,500
done. This is it. Okay. Cool. What did that do for me? Two? Maybe the one? What did that

535
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:59,859
do here? Seven. Where is it? Oh, right. You're right. Thank you. Nice. Nine. Oh, now I, okay.

536
01:11:59,859 --> 01:12:08,409
Hold on. I can do this now. Two, three, four, five, six, seven. Can't be there. Five, six,

537
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:27,539
seven, eight, nine. Five, six, seven. It's a guess. Can't do that. Eleven. Eleven. Good.

538
01:12:27,539 --> 01:12:36,819
I can't. I can't do that yet. I can't do it. I'm too nervous to do that. Too scared. This is

539
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:46,699
five. One, two, three, four, five. Can't be here. One, two, three, four, five. Right? No,

540
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:53,289
that's not accurate. One, two, three. It has to be one here though. Right? Three, four, five. Not

541
01:12:53,289 --> 01:13:03,720
accurate. As I know it is. It's accurate. It's a crab. I don't think it's a crab. And you know

542
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:13,619
what? It's probably a fire. Maybe a flame. Three and the eight. Three and the eight. Right. Okay.

543
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:24,239
So then this is, I got, I messed this up last time. One, two. This has got to be the eight.

544
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:49,229
This has to be like this. Three, four, five. Is it a bird? I think it might be a plane. No,

545
01:13:49,229 --> 01:13:58,079
of course not. It's Superman. Give me the fucking minus twos. Give them to me. Give me. Give me

546
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:01,920
them. I want to see them. I want only the chat to be fucking minus twos. It's all I want to see.

547
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:10,779
I better see it. Make me feel fucking horrible. Make me. I deserve it. Okay. This is done. There's

548
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:17,380
one. Is it the second one or the first one? Because if this is the second one, then this

549
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:52,510
is the three. Okay. I can't, don't guess. I got to put my like singer spin on it. Is that row done?

550
01:14:52,590 --> 01:15:00,979
Is that row done? Have we talked about this? But like anytime somebody does a song that's very,

551
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:09,060
the Mario theme song is very, there's no, it's just dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

552
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:14,899
It's like the national anthem. Like dun dun dun dun dun dun. But when you get like then the

553
01:15:14,899 --> 01:15:20,100
singer syndrome, you have to make it your own. You have to make it different. It can't just be like,

554
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:30,420
oh, say, can you see? No, it's going to be like, oh, say, can you see? Like they have, you have to

555
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:38,050
do your own like, wow, it's going to be, I got to make it different. Nobody just like sings a song

556
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:48,689
that's a very old like song that everybody knows. You have to give it your spin. True. Yeah. That's

557
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:59,500
always annoying. Well, I mean, I'm just telling you how it is. You did the same joke from the

558
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:06,300
Fear 2 stream. All right. Well, let's, hey, how many words have I spoken in the English? Okay.

559
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:11,180
Do this for me. I want one of you to do this because we'll see if that's the case. I don't

560
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:17,329
know how many words I've spoken on stream. I've said every word in the dictionary,

561
01:16:18,739 --> 01:16:24,800
like a hundred times each. I've said every fucking possible sentence. Like I've talked

562
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,520
50 million words. I'm going to backtrack onto one of some of those words sometimes.

563
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:39,279
I've said 500 million words on this stream. You said that same joke in the Fear 2 stream

564
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:48,579
back in like 2017. You're a liar. All right. Well, this is done.

565
01:16:48,579 --> 01:17:51,779
I'm so sorry. Hey, remember that? Like how many unfollows am I going to get in a day?

566
01:17:52,420 --> 01:18:07,140
Oh, we're almost done. Oh, what is it? What's it going to be? It's a bat. It's a bat. Yeah,

567
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:21,390
this is a bat for sure. It's a bat. It's a bat. You're embarrassing me. You're getting

568
01:18:21,390 --> 01:18:32,850
secondhand embarrassment because I'm annoying. Oh, very cool. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah. I haven't

569
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:42,420
done this one yet. I remember this one. I love that one. I mean, listen to quake two. Um,

570
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:52,609
this one's going to be hard. 15 by 15, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. So there'll be two spaces.

571
01:18:52,850 --> 01:19:02,659
Um, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I just thought my connect. I just like my connect.

572
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:11,039
I thought it was falling down on me. I just freaked out. This one is hard. Yeah, it is six.

573
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:25,630
It's 1112. Yeah. What we could do is so let's say it was so two, let's just do this. Like

574
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:31,090
let's just say it was this way space this way, right? That's like, that's not accurate,

575
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:37,649
but that's like, will give us some space here to work with. So technically this can be blocked

576
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:44,899
off like that temporarily. That's guessing. Yes, I know. If I do one, two, three, four, five, six,

577
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:56,100
seven, and then one space two, we have this whole quadrant is, oh, that's guessing. I know,

578
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:02,180
but technically speaking, I should have this much like room at least deduce that. Yeah, that's

579
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:09,899
accurate. Let me do what I'm doing. One, two space one space. So like I have this much room to work

580
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:17,680
with for the seven. I was right. Thank you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three,

581
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,720
four, five, six, seven. The seven that has to be like that. It's impossible for it not to be.

582
01:20:28,210 --> 01:20:37,810
I can hurry up. Timer's going up. Okay. Same deal with the other ones. So there's another group

583
01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:45,069
that's like that, right? Six and the five. Let's just say it was one, two, three, four, five space

584
01:20:45,069 --> 01:20:59,869
one, two, three, four, five, six. That means that I have to, I'm getting intense. I think from here

585
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:10,479
I can do, I was going to do it. And now ladies and gentlemen here to do for the, before the baseball

586
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:16,609
game, the sped up time of hurry up. You've got to get to the end of the Mario level. We've got

587
01:21:16,609 --> 01:21:20,640
Jeremy Albertson. Hey everybody.

588
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:33,439
Yeah.

589
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:06,609
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I don't know what to do on core. Turn on shuffle. Why?

590
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:15,359
All right. I need to deduce. Stop distracting me. I think that's my best bet. I really do one, two,

591
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:21,920
three, four, one, two, three, four, five space one, two, three, four, five, six. The six has

592
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:30,829
got to have one, two, three, four, five, six. Right. It has to be here somewhere. There has to

593
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:41,409
be three in a row here. I don't, I, I don't, it's, it's, that's tricky to, that's a, that's a guess,

594
01:22:41,409 --> 01:22:55,840
but it allows me to do this. Are there 12 K people watching this? Because you, you, you got here too

595
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:05,279
late. I just, I just like, you should, you should have been here five minutes ago and my views have

596
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:16,270
been going crazy. If you could see what I did right before you got here, I did a handstand.

597
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:23,760
Oh, I'm so fucking exhausted. I did a handstand for an hour and we had a timer that was a one

598
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:30,300
hour handstand. Like, and you fucking missed it. I'm like exhausted and I had to sing the national

599
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,319
anthem upside down and drink like milk upside down and shit. It was a big like follower thing

600
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:38,239
that we did. I had 500,000 followers today. It's not normally this many, but there's usually like,

601
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:43,859
maybe like a thousand people here. I don't know. This is crazy. It's a huge increase. I had to drink

602
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:47,779
milk upside down. It was like, and it went on my nose and stuff and everybody's laughing and like,

603
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:53,680
the views just kept going. I mean, I, and I was like, I got to relax. That was ridiculous.

604
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:59,899
I rode like a horse in here. Like, you don't have, you don't idea what's going to happen the next in

605
01:23:59,899 --> 01:24:10,479
the 500,000 follower stream. And like, I rode a horse around. Yeah. I'm tired. I just want to

606
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,199
play fucking Picross. I don't, I didn't just think there's many people going to be here.

607
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:25,569
Where should I go now? Rated like 20 times. Yeah. I remember, I remember favorite streamer X said,

608
01:24:25,649 --> 01:24:31,090
holy shit, this guy's riding around on a horse. He just did a handstand and like drank a glass of

609
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:39,180
milk upside down. What's going there? All right, guys, we're going there. They all did it. It was

610
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:53,279
weird. It's crazy. Cross out the three row. Yep. That helps a lot. Even if this is a guess,

611
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:57,100
but it's, I think it's accurate. It gives us some more stuff to work with here. Okay.

612
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:11,600
Anything more than three in a row. Damn it. Oh, that sucks. Called networking. Milk keg stand

613
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:21,899
sounds awful. Yeah, it does. What kind of, what, what, why would we be doing milk out of a keg?

614
01:25:22,619 --> 01:25:38,239
It seems really weird. That's like a prank. Oh man, we got ears. We got, we got bush light in here.

615
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,500
Let's get them up there. Yeah. Oh yeah. You want to do it? Yeah, I'll do a keg stand. Let's go.

616
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:48,130
All right. Take it off. Go ahead. Come on in. Put it in your mouth. All right. Let's jump upside

617
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:58,289
down. So tell them. This tastes something about this. Oh, it's milk.

618
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:28,239
Freshman drank milk. I do one. First character song. And this song is playing. Oh, fuck it.

619
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:51,729
Fuck this place. Drinking milk out of a keg. You lost viewers. All right. What do you want

620
01:26:51,729 --> 01:26:56,609
me to say? I do. What do you want me to do? Like, whatever. If people are going to leave,

621
01:26:56,609 --> 01:27:02,859
they're going to leave. All right. You losing viewers. Oh, well, whatever. Who cares?

622
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:10,859
There's 12, 15 million people live right now. If you don't want to listen to the Mario fast

623
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:15,260
song while I talk about chugging milk out of a keg while I sit here and just don't play the game,

624
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:20,399
then you're gone. There's somebody way more interesting you'll find. Is that accurate though?

625
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:32,029
Boom. All right. I'm done. Let me skip ahead. I don't want to hear this fucking shit anymore.

626
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:46,300
There we go. That's better. So let's just say that's that. Ego. I don't have an ego.

627
01:27:46,300 --> 01:28:24,369
Say that anymore. Love. Whatever. Why are they all so fast? Go. Okay. There we go. Scary music.

628
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:36,020
Can I do this up here though? One, two, three. I can't do it up here.

629
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:47,220
Where am I going to find the place to start from? It's not here. I don't know if this is the two or

630
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:54,210
the three. I don't know what this could be. I don't know what this is either. You just did 10

631
01:28:54,210 --> 01:29:04,829
minutes? What? This isn't PictoPix music. This is disarming a bomb music. Five, six column.

632
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:10,109
I can't do this though. One, two, three, four, five. I don't have enough. This is just guessing.

633
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:34,050
This is a straight up guess. Okay. Yeah. I didn't die. Nope. 499, 789. I think I think I'd rage

634
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:51,630
put this one. I don't like this one. Five, six. I can't do the five, six. How could be down? I

635
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:57,260
maybe I could just maybe these two in here. Like it would have to be like one of these two, right?

636
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:10,800
It has to be that though. It has to be. But that doesn't help me at all. The blue wire. I'm going

637
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:30,560
so slow. Yeah, this is a guess, but that doesn't even give me that much info. I mean, technically

638
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:40,260
speaking, I could guess and this could be like six could be down here, right? Could be that. And

639
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:50,420
then this could be part of the four, one, two, three, four. Then this is done. Do not guess.

640
01:30:51,140 --> 01:31:04,020
Don't guess. Look behind you. I'm fine. Seven. I can't do anything with the sevens. There's

641
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:16,449
nothing more than a four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Remember you suck at this.

642
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:28,399
Okay, we're done with Mario. I'm done with this hurry the fuck up music.

643
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:38,479
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to sing the Mario Galaxy opening theme song for the entrance of our

644
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:58,380
baseball game. German 985. He seems to be frozen. He's clenching the mic very, very tightly in both

645
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:05,520
of his hands with his eyes wide open. He's supposed to have been singing by now. Somebody get down

646
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:11,170
there. Get down there. He's frozen. He's done. He's clenched completely. Now he can't do it.

647
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:20,479
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. German 985. Catch him on Twitch. Somebody get him the fuck

648
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:28,420
out of here. Get him. Go get him. Just can the music. Go to the interlude shit. Interlude,

649
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:50,579
interlude. Thank you. Go get him. Wait, I might be naked in this image. It's like three guys just

650
01:32:50,579 --> 01:32:54,579
with one arm on my back just like moving me and I'm just slowly walking just clenching the fucking

651
01:32:54,579 --> 01:33:01,520
microphone. And then it all what an embarrassing fucking last ditch effort. I start to sing.

652
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:10,289
Oh, everyone's clapping. He's almost off. He's almost off the field. Get him off. Okay.

653
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:34,239
And they cut the mic. They like pull the cord. I'm rage quitting this one. I can't do it.

654
01:33:35,779 --> 01:33:39,619
For me to do these, I need like the one guaranteed space that I know I can do. And

655
01:33:39,619 --> 01:33:56,100
there's none of them here. Fuck. Just guess. Try the five by five one. I have to guess.

656
01:33:56,979 --> 01:34:12,479
I have to guess. I'm guessing. Whatever. Therefore, this is two two. They're all such

657
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:18,670
little numbers. Like, what the fuck? This one sucks. That didn't even help me.

658
01:34:24,689 --> 01:34:35,649
Five, six, seven. I just have to take a wild guess. Whatever. So this is four, maybe the two, three,

659
01:34:36,609 --> 01:34:50,239
vertical four, two, two. You sing the decay rap. I think I've done that before.

660
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,380
Too many low numbers. I don't like, I hate that. I like having the little, little numbers.

661
01:34:57,380 --> 01:35:08,100
Four, two, two. I don't know if that's accurate up here. Three, three, one, two, three, or one, two,

662
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:21,020
three. That's all I can do from that. Three row, three, three row, three column. What are you saying?

663
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:27,710
You can do the horizontal two, four, two. Okay. Let's just say this is the last two,

664
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:34,029
which I might not even be. It could be that. I don't have it. I can't do it. I don't have

665
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:47,869
enough info. Where is the fucking info? There's no info for this. I'm guessing. I'm trying not

666
01:35:47,869 --> 01:35:56,449
to guess. Where's the sure thing? Where is the sure thing on this list? I don't see it.

667
01:35:57,409 --> 01:36:05,710
Four, two, two. Vertical is a sure thing. One, two, three, four, one, two, space one, two.

668
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:14,239
Vertical four, two, two is a sure thing. Where? How? The two, two's could be anywhere. They could be

669
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:19,779
here. They could be here, here. It could be two, space two. It could be two, space two. They could

670
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:32,319
be anywhere. Fourth row down on that row. One, two, three, four. Make progress. You can do it.

671
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:45,550
I believe in you. This is a guess though. I think this one just sucks. Look at all these dumb one,

672
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:49,470
two, one, one, two, one, one, two, two, two. It's like, no, get out of here. This one's stupid.

673
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:01,890
Four, okay. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Now does it go this way or this way? The two.

674
01:37:03,010 --> 01:37:15,060
No idea. Vertical seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

675
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:24,750
Okay. This is two, four, two. This, there's the one, one. Is that, but that, if I guessed,

676
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:29,489
I took a guess. I have no idea if that's accurate or not. I've done, how am I supposed to know that?

677
01:37:35,229 --> 01:37:39,949
It's not a guess. It is a guess though. I had to deduce that and I had to make an educated guess

678
01:37:39,949 --> 01:37:45,520
to get this even in the first place. Okay. Hold on. How are we doing? Now this is two, four.

679
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:52,399
There's your two. There's your four. Who knows where the hell the other two could be?

680
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:57,260
There's your three. That's done. All right. These are guesses. I don't know. I have no,

681
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:09,970
I don't know how to play the game. Two, two. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

682
01:38:10,689 --> 01:38:24,659
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Should we be dancing? Getting there. All right. I need a,

683
01:38:25,539 --> 01:38:42,899
uh, okay. Hold on. That's going to help a lot. Three, three, one. This is probably the three right

684
01:38:42,899 --> 01:38:54,930
here. Right? Cause then it'd be two this way. Right? Yes. I think that's correct. No. What?

685
01:38:54,930 --> 01:39:16,180
So this could be the one. I don't know. All right. Hold on. I feel, I really feel like it's like right

686
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:25,140
here. Three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This is one. This

687
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:36,430
is probably the one. Yeah. It has to be. Three. This is a three here. One, two, three. Not there.

688
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:51,439
One, two, three. Can't be there. Okay. I wrote the soundtrack. What? What? Dude, did you seriously?

689
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:59,420
Are you serious? Oh my God. Welcome. Welcome. We need to welcome that person. Oh my God.

690
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:22,479
Hey, there's another one. Okay. That does do. I feel like this is nothing. They have to be over

691
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:35,579
here. Otherwise, what the hell is this connected to? Or right here, I'm assuming. You know where

692
01:40:35,579 --> 01:40:51,329
to put the one. Do I? Yes, I do. Don't I? Right? Like that, that's pretty, that's pretty, that's

693
01:40:51,329 --> 01:41:15,520
pretty close. Okay. Could be one too. No evidence. The music is making this worse.

694
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:23,890
Like I'll, I keep just seeing Mario running. Okay. So this is the ADHD is just fucking striking.

695
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:29,649
It's ugly head here. Like I'm playing this game in front of my screen, but I am seeing in my head

696
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:39,260
Mario running around on planets. Like I'm playing two games at the same time. I'm just in that game

697
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:46,340
in my head just playing it. And while I'm just here now, like I just collected a coin. I just got

698
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:51,779
like two coins. Oh yeah. Oh, I did the thing where you do, you spin around accidentally.

699
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:55,380
Cause the wee boat like crossed the plane. You didn't even mean to do it, but you get,

700
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:59,140
whoa, whoa. You get really annoyed by it for a second. Cause you're like, oh, I didn't fucking

701
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:17,090
want to do that. All right. Where are we here? This is two, four, seven, one. Where's that one?

702
01:42:18,029 --> 01:42:29,039
Or, oh, okay. Hold on. Good. That's one of the twos. This has to be the four. Okay. So therefore

703
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:38,000
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. That's a risky move right there. Cause this

704
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,520
has to be the only, that's the only one I could put there. Right? Wait one, two shit. It could be

705
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:54,819
here. Yes. I know. Yeah. I know. Stop playing Mario galaxy. I've stopped playing Mario galaxy.

706
01:42:54,819 --> 01:43:05,409
I'm playing Mario galaxy in my head. Shit. I just did like a super jump from one gravitational

707
01:43:05,409 --> 01:43:10,779
planet to the other gravitational planet. It was just like pulled me in and I went all the

708
01:43:10,859 --> 01:43:27,279
way around the planet and went up and then landed. Okay. Hold on. Let me focus. This is,

709
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:32,289
if this is the other three right here, I know that's a guess, but one, two, three,

710
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:36,850
that means there's the other two. And then I have the four over here. I'm just going to,

711
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:40,930
I'm going for it. That's a guess, but I'm going for it. I think that's correct. Isn't this a

712
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:50,289
space for one down here somewhere that lets me continue. So therefore one, two, three, get rid

713
01:43:50,289 --> 01:43:57,489
of that. One, two, three. That gives me the second two. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

714
01:43:57,489 --> 01:44:11,180
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Now what? Oh shit. One, two, three, four, five, six.

715
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:22,380
There it is. I knew these are going to be closed off. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two,

716
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:29,939
three. One, two. It is one, two, three, four. Okay. It could be either one of those. Relax.

717
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:50,579
Who's this guy talking? Oh, it's, of course it's a Drupal985. Three. This has to be the three.

718
01:44:53,010 --> 01:45:06,539
Therefore that's the three. This is the three. One, two, three. Okay. Seven goes down all the way,

719
01:45:06,539 --> 01:45:21,619
right? Cause that would be four to two. Wait, hold on. Is this the guy that found an ancient

720
01:45:21,619 --> 01:45:35,659
treasure on stream? I did. This is part of the three. One, two, three. I can, I know I can deduce

721
01:45:35,659 --> 01:45:41,460
this right now, but my brain just can't do it. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four,

722
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:53,489
five. My brain is so small. No, I have a huge brain. It's just, I don't know. I feel like I've

723
01:45:53,489 --> 01:45:58,130
like sucked like an intelligence vacuum in the back of my head over the last like 10 years.

724
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:21,729
Three, four, five, six, seven. Where could this actually be though? I know I can do this. Let me,

725
01:46:21,729 --> 01:46:38,670
all right. Quiet. Quiet, everybody. Quiet. If I do this one here, what would be,

726
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:44,770
this is the second two and that would be the three going this way. I think that's correct.

727
01:46:45,569 --> 01:47:00,109
And then now I've got three. Seven is now five, six, seven. Five, six, seven. What's this? That's a one,

728
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:18,609
two, three, two, space, two, three. Okay. Hold on. Three there. Three, five, seven. One, two, three,

729
01:47:18,609 --> 01:47:34,420
four, five, six, seven. One, no. I hope this is correct. Now could this be this way? I think

730
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:52,380
that's done. Right? Oh, I'm just going. I'm just going. I hope this is correct. Three, two, two,

731
01:47:53,260 --> 01:48:09,649
one, four. I need four here. One, two, three, four. You guys think it's a gun? Okay. Hold on.

732
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:36,180
Second row. Three, two, five. Okay. Good. There's the three. Yes. It only took me

733
01:48:36,899 --> 01:48:54,060
30 minutes to get here. Now this is one, three, one, two, three. Okay. Now I've got a mess over

734
01:48:54,060 --> 01:49:09,630
here to deal with. Is it a shark? Yeah, this is a dolphin. It's some type of amphibious fish or

735
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:30,109
something. One, two, three, four, one, two. I think you Pat stares at for the raid. Pat stares at.

736
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:38,449
Welcome, everybody. We had a good stream, Pat. I'm Jerma. Currently doing. What are we doing? We're

737
01:49:38,449 --> 01:49:46,619
doing Hick Ross with intense music behind it. Because that's what we do here. Super epic,

738
01:49:46,619 --> 01:49:54,380
intense streams. X, X, X, X, X. Go with the fucking X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. All done. All

739
01:49:54,380 --> 01:50:08,659
of them gone. All right. What are we doing? Done. This one's done. Two, three. Oh, it's almost done.

740
01:50:08,659 --> 01:50:36,539
Our dolphin is almost done. Our dolphin. Oh, oh, that was wrong. What went wrong? What went

741
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:40,220
wrong? What did I do wrong? I was like, no, I wasn't paying attention. Two, one, two, two.

742
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:49,390
Oh, this is a no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Stop. One space, one space. Why is

743
01:50:49,390 --> 01:51:26,449
this three? What happened here? How did I, what did I do? What happened here? One, one, did I do

744
01:51:26,449 --> 01:51:32,930
wrong here? You're almost there. I got, yeah. I almost, I just got to fix this somehow. Move

745
01:51:32,930 --> 01:51:54,420
four. This looks out of place. Start over again. Oh my God. Get out of here. Two, one, three. This is

746
01:51:54,420 --> 01:52:16,819
two, one, one, one, two. Oh, goodness. This is so almost done. Where is this? Move one from one, one,

747
01:52:17,699 --> 01:52:35,869
two, one, three. It's like done. It's the eye. Yeah, that's the eye right there. But what is this

748
01:52:35,869 --> 01:52:43,090
thing? That shouldn't be there. All right. Turn off the fucking, like, we're about to like fly into

749
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:48,659
outer space music. I need to concentrate. All I could see was be strapped to an astronaut chair.

750
01:52:48,659 --> 01:52:53,140
Just like going up into the moon and stuff. Like get that off. I need to pay attention.

751
01:52:53,779 --> 01:53:29,659
I think it's down here. Um, where's the mistake? Where I, where's the fucking mistake? What is it?

752
01:53:29,979 --> 01:53:46,930
What is this stupid ass mistake? One, three. This is, this is all fucked up. Move vertical one,

753
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:56,539
three, down by one. Move vertical one, three, down by one. Wait, what? Vertical one, three.

754
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:08,300
What happened? Fill in the four. This is wrong. Oh my God. What is the fucking wrong here? What

755
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:32,880
is the problem? What did I do? Seven, one needs to be over one. Like over here. Oh no. No. Okay.

756
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:46,939
Hold on. One, go back more? No, I don't think so. Two, one, two is bad. Two, one, two, bad. Two,

757
01:54:46,939 --> 01:55:18,529
one, two, bad. Who is back here? Here? Three, four, done, done. Seven, two, two, three.

758
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:35,859
One, two oatmeal. I don't know what that means. One, one, two. One, one, two. One, one, two.

759
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:49,920
But where is the mistake? Oh God damn it. One, does this need to be moved over? There's so many

760
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:58,270
X's and shit on the screen. I have no idea what's going on. The bottom of one, one, two is the

761
01:55:58,270 --> 01:56:12,130
mistake. You have one, two, one, one, one, like here. And then, so where the hell does this two go?

762
01:56:17,739 --> 01:56:27,819
One, one, two. And then one. Oh my God. I'm like literally like seeing colors right now. It's like

763
01:56:27,819 --> 01:56:38,189
everything's just mixing together. Three is two. One, one, two is throwing. Help me. Just help me,

764
01:56:38,189 --> 01:57:08,699
please. One, three down one block. Then where's the one go? This two is done. Two, one, two,

765
01:57:08,779 --> 01:57:23,279
two, one, two, two, one. Oh my God. Somebody help me, please. Oh.

766
01:57:39,010 --> 01:57:51,569
Oh, there's one. Fucking finally. Oh, get out of here. Come on. Okay. Whatever you say, win.

767
01:57:52,529 --> 01:57:58,859
This is 15. So three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. This is interesting.

768
01:57:59,579 --> 01:58:23,409
Three, two, two, three, four, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, eight. I can do this one. Let's just say,

769
01:58:23,409 --> 01:58:27,340
for instance, this is occupied. It looks like one, one. So let's, I guess what I got to work

770
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:32,939
with. So we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,

771
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:43,649
seven, eight. Cool. So what does that do for us here? What does that do? I'm so, what the hell

772
01:58:43,649 --> 01:58:47,819
was I doing? I don't know. I thought that was going to be funny or something. I don't know

773
01:58:47,819 --> 01:58:51,819
what that was. I thought that was going to be funny. I was like, oh, I'll make like a noise.

774
01:58:51,819 --> 01:58:58,380
That wasn't even, why would I do that? There's no reason to even do that. Oh, this is the song,

775
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:12,609
is the song. Oh, let me make like a loud slurp, snort thing. I don't know. That was not even funny

776
01:59:12,609 --> 01:59:21,489
at all. Okay. One, five, six, seven, eight, nine spaces. I think I can do this one here.

777
01:59:23,779 --> 01:59:40,180
Five and five. I don't know if this is the one or the two.

778
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:52,140
That did not help me at all. One, two horizontal can make a lot of X on the right.

779
01:59:56,050 --> 02:00:00,180
Well, here's the problem though. I don't know if this is the one or the two,

780
02:00:00,180 --> 02:00:12,699
because if this is the one, the two could be anywhere over here. I feel like I can

781
02:00:12,699 --> 02:00:26,539
get this one somehow. Let's see. One, two, three, one, two, two, three. I mean, it's got a

782
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:35,390
Five lets you place one on each side, doesn't it? It's very loud. Let me turn that down a little.

783
02:00:37,569 --> 02:00:51,409
The fives can do one on each side. I guess this could be one here and then one here.

784
02:00:52,289 --> 02:01:04,220
Is that possible? One here and one here, right? I think that makes sense. Oh, shit. Nice. Okay.

785
02:01:04,220 --> 02:01:08,619
Hold on. One, two, one, two. Take a look at this. If that's accurate, which it should be.

786
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:18,180
Now this helps here. Not really, but kind of. This doesn't even help at all, actually.

787
02:01:18,979 --> 02:01:28,930
I don't know if this is the three or the one. It's probably the one.

788
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:40,270
Louder? All right. It's a little louder. Relax. Three, two, two is easier now.

789
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:50,130
It is. You're right. One, two, three, space, one, two, space, one, two, three. Oh, it doesn't.

790
02:01:55,329 --> 02:01:58,739
That means it would be, hold on. Oh, this is blocked off.

791
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:06,020
We'll do like this then. One, two, three, space, one, two, two, one, two, three. Shit.

792
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:14,140
It's not, I can't do it yet though. It could be, this whole thing could be moved over one spot.

793
02:02:14,939 --> 02:02:29,970
You can play some. I guess I could. Which ones are guaranteed? I would probably say that this

794
02:02:29,970 --> 02:02:37,659
one's guaranteed. That's the only one that I think is guaranteed, right? I got 500k? Did I?

795
02:02:39,579 --> 02:02:47,680
Four, nine, nine, 98. No, we're not there. Four. Oh, no, we did. That's 500,000. Holy shit. Cool.

796
02:02:47,680 --> 02:03:01,229
500,000 followers on Twitch. Wow. Thanks, guys. It's been a lot of fun. Cool. 500k.

797
02:03:03,069 --> 02:03:20,859
Speech. Rub-a-dub-dub. Thanks for the grub. Part. Why, you little. So this one is accurate, right?

798
02:03:21,420 --> 02:03:29,140
Because if it's one, two, three, one, two, three, these two can be placed. These, I don't,

799
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:34,739
I can't do these ones though. Fuck, I'm unfollowing. What are you talking about?

800
02:03:34,739 --> 02:03:52,350
So that helps. That helps a lot. Well, that helps a lot. All right. So this changes everything here

801
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:56,770
because I might be able to actually do this now. One, two, three, four, five,

802
02:03:56,770 --> 02:04:07,250
space, one, two, three, four, five. Most of these can be filled in. At least a lot of them can.

803
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:17,229
Which then one, two, three, by this whole row. Wait. Wait, what happened? Hold on. Why did I

804
02:04:17,229 --> 02:04:24,430
just do that? One, two, one, two, three. Okay. Oh, wait. I'm freaking out. 500k song? Omega Low

805
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:39,699
under 500k. Well, it's not these ones. Not these ones. Is that incorrect? Wrong. Wrong. This is

806
02:04:39,699 --> 02:04:49,600
wrong, right? This is one, two, three. I can block that off. This is probably the three.

807
02:04:49,600 --> 02:05:02,979
That's probably the three. One, two, block this off. All right. Five, five is wrong. One, two,

808
02:05:02,979 --> 02:05:12,239
one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five.

809
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:41,170
It was right. No, I think one, two, one, two. No, that's right. Oh my God. This is a Nancy

810
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:52,430
Drew game. Yup. That's not right. Are you sure? I think that's correct. Because then that gets

811
02:05:52,430 --> 02:05:58,560
rid of that. That is right. Yeah, that's correct. So then it's not, I have to just worry about the

812
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:05,300
eight here. Three. Can't be that way. So one, two, three. It's close. I can't do it yet, though.

813
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:22,430
Oh, fuck. What do I do? Three, three. No two here yet. Four, four, three. You filthy animal. Oh my

814
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:30,670
God. It could be one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three.

815
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,239
I can't do it. Three, two, row. I can have stuff blocked.

816
02:06:44,590 --> 02:07:00,770
You messing with me? Are you messing with me? All right. So this would be the three. One, two, three.

817
02:07:01,569 --> 02:07:12,020
Three. Can't beat any of these. It has to be here. You messing with me? That's done. What about here

818
02:07:12,020 --> 02:07:23,300
now? So this is definitely the two and the two somehow. Oh, fuck. This is wrong. So it was wrong.

819
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:49,579
The five was right. Three, two is the bad one. This one here. Three, two wrong, not five. Oh,

820
02:07:49,579 --> 02:07:57,869
this one's wrong. What else does this logically go? The X's you put on three, two are wrong.

821
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:22,829
This was, if this is two, then this can't exist here. Remove the two. Shit. So if this is, this

822
02:08:23,149 --> 02:08:31,600
nothing over here can be used. This is correct, right? If this is correct, then I can't do

823
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:45,119
anything up there. And with this one. And this one. And this one. Okay. So how, what the hell?

824
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:52,770
It has to be, is this the two then? This must be the two. Maybe not. It could be one, two, three.

825
02:08:52,770 --> 02:09:06,930
This could be three, two. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. What does that do for me over here? It's mate. Four,

826
02:09:06,930 --> 02:09:16,560
four, three. I can't do the four, four, three yet. Let's see. One, one, two, three, four. One,

827
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:26,159
two, three. Let's see what it looks like. Can't do that yet. Oh my God. Relax. Bird row from the

828
02:09:26,159 --> 02:09:33,979
bottom. Fifth from the left. I can't, I like, you just gave me directions. Wait, wait, wait,

829
02:09:33,979 --> 02:09:41,979
wait, wait, wait, wait. This is three, five. I mean this one, two, three space. All right.

830
02:09:41,979 --> 02:09:52,220
The three has to be here. There's your two. There's that. There's three. Cap that. There's the one.

831
02:09:54,220 --> 02:10:03,739
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. There's three. Close that off. That's the one.

832
02:10:03,739 --> 02:10:10,380
This is the two. So one, two, nothing over here. One, two could be over that way. There's the two.

833
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:15,260
The first one, of course, there's the four. This row's done. This gives you the three,

834
02:10:15,260 --> 02:10:27,579
which completes the two. Complete that three. What do we have here? That's the one. What about

835
02:10:27,579 --> 02:10:32,939
here? One, five. There's a two over here. Which has to be one of these. That's your three. Lock

836
02:10:32,939 --> 02:10:47,699
that off. Okay. This has to be four. That's done. There's two. Two, two, three. Ooh, this is getting

837
02:10:47,699 --> 02:10:57,619
exciting. Three. Lock it off. It killed this whole thing. Four, four, three. Oh, that was so

838
02:10:57,619 --> 02:11:08,529
satisfying. I love that. Three. We need two and then two somewhere over here. Here's the real

839
02:11:08,529 --> 02:11:14,399
question though. This can't be three. This has to be the three. One, two, three. Oh, I don't know

840
02:11:14,399 --> 02:11:26,539
that yet. Hold on. Okay. Good. Can any of these be brought from the bottom? This is the one.

841
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:36,939
Yep, it is. Also a one. Here's the eight. Cool. Can't be a two here.

842
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:45,979
I'm not doing that. People are gonna actually like think that's fucking annoying. Like, I would.

843
02:11:47,579 --> 02:11:50,539
If it were me in the chat room right now, I would be like, that's annoying. And like,

844
02:11:50,539 --> 02:11:58,779
just stop doing it. It's not funny. That would like annoy me. That would be actually annoying.

845
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:10,670
There's one. There's also a one. All right, now it's all coming together. Can't be here. One, two,

846
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:18,430
three, four, five. There's the three. When it all starts coming together, I love it. It looks so

847
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:30,989
wonderful. There's your two. Wait. Don't get too crazy about this. That's one, one, two. This is

848
02:12:30,989 --> 02:12:45,970
the last two. What even is this thing? I have no idea what this is. What is this? What is it?

849
02:12:46,689 --> 02:12:56,109
Flame? Oh, it's a campfire. Nice. It's peanut butter jelly time. That actually did kind of look

850
02:12:56,109 --> 02:13:01,140
like that. Nice. Okay, is there any more that I didn't do back here? I did them all back here,

851
02:13:01,140 --> 02:13:13,039
right? Nice. Look at how many I did. Well, here we go. There's still more to do. I kind of want to

852
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:20,420
do a huge one. Where's the first 20? Okay, this is 20 by 20. This is gonna be a mess, by the way.

853
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:30,539
Good luck. This actually is good. It's 16. One, two, three, four. Technically, one, two, three,

854
02:13:30,539 --> 02:13:37,550
four, right? Does it need to have four on either side? All right. Oh, it happened. It actually

855
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:45,390
happened. This is the equivalent of getting in breakout the ball stuck on top in the first or

856
02:13:45,390 --> 02:14:09,170
second shot of the game. You'll see what I mean in a second. Nice. Okay. Oh, 15, 16, 17. Oh, wow.

857
02:14:09,729 --> 02:14:17,409
Okay. So, this is connected here because it's one by 15. That's one, two, three, four, five, six,

858
02:14:17,409 --> 02:14:23,649
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Space one. Well, could this be

859
02:14:23,649 --> 02:14:31,090
the one? And we go wham. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

860
02:14:31,090 --> 02:14:38,369
Nope. Has to be connected. This is done already. Holy shit. Cool. Anything else already done? This

861
02:14:38,369 --> 02:14:46,579
is done. This looks like some kind of, is it like a box? Four. Can't be in the middle there.

862
02:14:48,619 --> 02:14:57,600
It's a snail. Yeah, it's probably going to be a snail. Okay. Seven. I think it's in the middle.

863
02:14:57,600 --> 02:15:12,300
Is it? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Okay. Two or two. Don't know yet. It is a snail.

864
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:21,840
Yeah. Is it going to be a snail? One, two, two, one. All right. A cat? Will it be like a cathead?

865
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:31,819
No, it's not a cat. Four, two. Don't have the info for that. Two could be in there. One, fifteen.

866
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:41,970
A lot of shit over here. Let's see. One of these is four. One of these is two. That's the first two.

867
02:15:41,970 --> 02:15:51,380
Or the second two. That could be the second two. Nope. One, four. One, two, one, two, three, four.

868
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:58,779
One, two, three, four. One, two. Wait, I don't have that info, do I? Yeah, I do. One, two, three, four.

869
02:15:59,739 --> 02:16:15,949
Nine, one. Oh, shit. Cool. All right. And it's four. Nice. Yeah, it's definitely a snail.

870
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:24,220
All right. So that means two, one, one. Close that off. There's your two. There's your one.

871
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:39,569
The whole thing is gone. Maybe it's a dog. Four. Anything else? One, two, two, two, two, two, two,

872
02:16:39,569 --> 02:16:53,899
one. What about this one? One, two, two, one, two. Dinosaur? I think you guys got it right. I think

873
02:16:53,899 --> 02:17:06,450
it is a snail. Four, three, four. One, two, three, four. Okay, so that's two. Block that off. That's

874
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:18,940
one. Block it off. Block it off. And fifteen. Take a look at that. Done. Nice. Four. Got it. Two. Close

875
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:32,459
it. Two. Close it. Sixteen can, I think, be completed here. Almost. One, two, one. It's a one-up.

876
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:51,069
It is a one-up. Oh, shit. Okay. Yeah. Is this like Mario? Wait, this is wrong. One, one, two, three,

877
02:17:51,069 --> 02:18:00,989
four, five. One, two. How's that wrong? It's a number DMCA. How did I get DMCA'd over this?

878
02:18:01,469 --> 02:18:09,040
That's right, right? No, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't be an idiot.

879
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:31,280
It's done. Two, two, two. One, one. Done. One, two. Shit. One, two, one. Oh, there it is. Nice.

880
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:59,059
One-up. Extra life. It really did look like a snail, though. This one is very weird. Okay.

881
02:19:01,969 --> 02:19:07,899
Uh, I guess let's just start putting it out. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

882
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:25,280
Seven. One, one, four. One, one, one, one, one. Okay. Ten, seventeen, eighteen. But hold on.

883
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:48,879
Let me just do this first. One step at a time. Seven. Okay. All right. Four. There's another

884
02:19:48,959 --> 02:19:55,549
four in here. Number nineteen is the whole way down. Oh, shit. Okay. Yeah, you're right. It is.

885
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:08,829
The bottom is blocked off. You're right. Okay. Oh, my God. I have to do the top now. All right.

886
02:20:08,829 --> 02:20:27,500
I'm getting overwhelmed if I don't stop. What else do I have that's guaranteed? Somewhere in here.

887
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:48,979
One, two, three. These are all ones, so just block it off. Bottom one. Ten, seven. Yep. One,

888
02:20:48,979 --> 02:20:55,360
two, three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Now we do the

889
02:20:55,360 --> 02:21:06,020
bottom. All right. This is done. All the way up. This one is done there. One, one, one, one.

890
02:21:06,659 --> 02:21:19,790
No, that's four. Four. All row. Nice. Oh, God. This is the most boring game to watch,

891
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:41,139
Jerma, please. Go watch one of the other 700 million streams. Just change the look.

892
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:54,989
An infomercial is on right now on this channel. Just like, you can flip around. Is this a QR code?

893
02:21:54,989 --> 02:22:15,729
I don't know. Yo, it's a QR code. No, this is fun. I'm having fun. Can I go this way?

894
02:22:17,659 --> 02:22:21,979
Picross is like one of my favorite video games ever made. It's right next to Diablo II.

895
02:22:21,979 --> 02:22:26,100
If this shit was on that 100 best games of all time list, it would have been numbered three.

896
02:22:31,809 --> 02:22:38,190
One, one, maybe 10. All right. Wait, wait, wait. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

897
02:22:38,190 --> 02:22:49,219
eight, nine, 10. One, two, three, four, five. It's all in here. He loves Picross,

898
02:22:49,219 --> 02:23:02,670
but he hates Tetris. Yeah, because Tetris is stupid. Fuck you.

899
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:23,620
I don't like Tetris. Is that illegal to say? I don't like Tetris. I don't like Tetris.

900
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:33,120
It's gonna be the four. Nope. Yeah, it could be. That is illegal. All right. Hold on. Almost done.

901
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:42,850
Three, four. So it can't be this one. All right. There's so many ones and fours. I'm gonna lose

902
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:54,450
track here. One, one. Next thing is two fours in a row. Is this a maze? I don't know. Well,

903
02:23:54,450 --> 02:24:02,110
there's another one here, another one here, and then a seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

904
02:24:02,829 --> 02:24:20,059
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Right? The seven has to be in the middle here. Good. I do

905
02:24:20,059 --> 02:24:27,659
not like Tetris. Tetris is fun to watch somebody that knows what they're doing, but not for me to

906
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:38,399
play it. He said he loved Tetris in an Overwatch stream like four years ago. I'm making it up. I

907
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:45,899
don't know. Show me the clip. You show me the clip of me talking about how much I love Tetris.

908
02:24:45,899 --> 02:25:02,959
You tell me. I want to see it. One, four, one. There's another one here. Find it. Find it.

909
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:14,559
I need the fours here. This is one, four, four, one, seven, one, four. Let's just say it's here.

910
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:28,139
That means it would be one, two, three, four. I can deduce that. Do I read chat? I've been reading.

911
02:25:28,139 --> 02:25:32,719
How would I come up with all the things you guys are saying? How would I come up with all the things

912
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:50,479
you guys are saying? Okay. That hit a seven writer. Nope. That's a one, seven, one. Shit.

913
02:25:50,479 --> 02:26:10,860
False comments. I Tetris. No, I get too frustrated when I play Tetris. I can't do it.

914
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:21,700
I get omega frustrated. Okay. One, seven. It's going to get harder. I guess I'll get harder.

915
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:35,940
Then two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There's another one here. So let's

916
02:26:35,940 --> 02:26:43,420
just say it's here. That means let's just say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

917
02:26:43,420 --> 02:26:56,860
nine, ten. Does that do anything for me? It does. That actually does a lot. I hope it's right. Okay.

918
02:26:58,340 --> 02:27:02,979
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. How are you guys doing? I didn't ask

919
02:27:02,979 --> 02:27:10,819
that. Did I? Did I ask that? Did I ask how you guys are doing today? I should have. How are you?

920
02:27:10,819 --> 02:27:23,969
Hard things. You got a test tomorrow? Shit. It's all right. You have to do fine. Remember, don't

921
02:27:23,969 --> 02:27:29,139
worry. But if you get, as long as you get like a C plus to a B minus is fine. Don't let anybody

922
02:27:29,139 --> 02:27:42,379
tell you differently. I've got seven here. There's one here. Get this one. I'm going to have to start

923
02:27:42,379 --> 02:27:53,729
here. So let's see. Two, three, four, five, six. Now it's still the same. Okay. Xbox. Turn off.

924
02:27:53,729 --> 02:28:05,870
Going kind of sad because I don't like school. Neither did I. Neither did I. I actually really

925
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:12,829
didn't like school. I thought it was like boring and annoying and it pissed me off. But I did it.

926
02:28:12,829 --> 02:28:25,620
I got through it. I was doing enough. I think we put too much pressure on like kids to do really

927
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:32,510
well in school. We teach them stuff they have to memorize and then we base how smart they are based

928
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:41,229
on how much they remembered. Which I think that's not the correct way to do things. But you know,

929
02:28:44,559 --> 02:28:57,520
I'm looking for the one that's over here. This is almost done. Here we go. One, one, four. This is

930
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:08,319
the four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. I think that's correct. This has to be the

931
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:15,489
seven. Oh God. This is a guess, but it's I'm taking an educated guess here. This is a guess,

932
02:29:15,489 --> 02:29:43,389
but whatever. Guessing Gary. I think that's right. But people learn so differently. I honestly,

933
02:29:43,389 --> 02:29:48,750
I think our entire education system has been still doing the same things that they did back

934
02:29:48,750 --> 02:29:55,090
in like the forties. Like there's so much shit that we need to know that we need to learn that

935
02:29:55,090 --> 02:30:02,100
are important. Like why are we still treating school like it's a 19, like fucking 20? I don't

936
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:06,639
understand. I don't know why. We literally have cars that are going to fucking start driving on

937
02:30:06,639 --> 02:30:10,399
their own. We're still using the same like educational system from like the fucking thirties.

938
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:24,579
Why? I don't know. Oh, I was, I thought you guys, okay. I thought you guys were saying 7-Eleven.

939
02:30:25,540 --> 02:30:28,979
Like 7-Eleven, like go to 7-Eleven. I thought it was like a weird stream joke thing you guys

940
02:30:28,979 --> 02:30:37,500
are doing. Seven, seven. Okay. Hold on. Oh, right here. Like go to 7-Eleven, 7-Eleven,

941
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:50,829
get like a Slurpee. I don't know. I thought you guys are making a weird joke. Oh wow. That

942
02:30:50,829 --> 02:31:08,370
changed everything. Oh shit. Okay. This one was done. Hungry, hungry hippos. Actually not a bad

943
02:31:08,370 --> 02:31:20,909
idea. One, one. It's done. What the hell are we looking at here? You know what I mean? Like,

944
02:31:20,909 --> 02:31:36,530
what is this? Four? Four? Some kind of maze? Hold on. Go back. I think, I think I just didn't

945
02:31:36,530 --> 02:31:55,899
want to do that. Hold on. Four. What is this? Labyrinth. That's kind of dull. Labyrinth.

946
02:32:03,709 --> 02:32:19,440
Oh, this one looks cool. This is 20 by 20. Oh no. It's an FTK maze. This is the whole thing.

947
02:32:20,079 --> 02:32:28,579
Any of the big ones? Seven would be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Two, three, four,

948
02:32:28,579 --> 02:32:32,819
five, six, seven. I mean, I know I can't deduce that, but I don't care. I'm keeping it there.

949
02:32:33,950 --> 02:33:06,770
N-eleven, 12, 13, 14. Uh, new ISD. But, um, Hearthstone. No, no, no. Hearthstone. Fine. How

950
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:15,299
about The Sims 1? I think that's pretty good. I'll be playing this when I get back. I'm gonna do a

951
02:33:15,299 --> 02:33:25,229
Sims 1 stream. Multiple streams probably. Okay. Well, very obviously this is connected together.

952
02:33:25,870 --> 02:33:36,829
There's no way it's not. Eight, nine, ten, eleven. That would be, let's just say one, two, three,

953
02:33:36,829 --> 02:33:43,229
four, five, six, seven, eight. Space one, two. Or we could do one, two, space. So that would be

954
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:51,020
right there. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six,

955
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:59,739
seven, eight. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. All right. That looks pretty good to me.

956
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:11,739
Fourteen would be how much on each side? It'd be like this, right? Six, one, two, three, four, five,

957
02:34:11,739 --> 02:34:23,920
six. Yay. Yay. Gabby J. Yay. Yay. I have, I have an actual curiosity for you guys.

958
02:34:25,069 --> 02:34:34,180
How many times over the last five years on Twitch have I done the super punch out Gabby J. guy?

959
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:39,649
It's probably like five to ten times. I've done it a lot. It's been at least three to five times.

960
02:34:39,649 --> 02:34:45,629
At least probably ten. I don't know why it just pops in and just does it. Okay. Seven. There it is.

961
02:34:46,190 --> 02:34:52,799
I didn't do it yesterday. I wasn't streaming yesterday. What are you talking about?

962
02:34:54,340 --> 02:35:09,950
He did it yesterday. Three, four, five, six. Two, three, four. He did it yesterday. Six, seven.

963
02:35:12,510 --> 02:35:31,219
All right. Getting there. Revoice Andy. Ow. How did you just hurt me? Well, this is interesting.

964
02:35:31,219 --> 02:35:36,739
Is this the two or the seven? Probably the two. Wait. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

965
02:35:36,739 --> 02:35:49,379
Can't be down here. That's the seven. But then none of these can be correct. Cool. That shaves that

966
02:35:49,379 --> 02:35:56,479
down. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, space, one, two. All right. So let's just say

967
02:35:56,479 --> 02:36:02,739
there's one, two. I'm just saying. That doesn't mean it's, I just scratched your, I scratched you

968
02:36:02,739 --> 02:36:24,110
in the eye. Could it be there? Interesting. Interesting. One, two, three. This whole row

969
02:36:24,110 --> 02:36:36,860
is done for this one. It's probably the two in here. One, two, three. Oh, this is wrong.

970
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:58,590
This is ugly. What happened here? I think it has solved this, which means this is three and this

971
02:36:58,590 --> 02:37:15,010
is three. One, two, three. Killed out. One, two, three. Killed out. I'd like to solve six, six.

972
02:37:15,010 --> 02:37:20,850
Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. Get out of here. Get out of here. I like this one. It's

973
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:31,780
cool. I like this one. This one's nice. I'd like to spin, please. Oh, right. That's from the

974
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:44,049
Little Fortune game. Is it a goose? I don't know. Well, one is this again. This is completely toast

975
02:37:44,049 --> 02:38:02,180
down here. Nice. Very nice. Very nice. Wait, don't assume. And one, this all goes away. One, two,

976
02:38:02,180 --> 02:38:11,709
three, four. Block those. Can't be there. Can't be there. How does he read messages the moment

977
02:38:11,709 --> 02:38:29,620
they come out? The Five Nights at Freddy's guy. I don't know if this is the four or the three.

978
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:36,690
It's probably the, it's the four. Okay. So that means this whole thing is done, which means this

979
02:38:36,690 --> 02:38:47,870
is done too. And so is this. Is it a flamingo? It's probably a flamingo. I think it's a flamingo.

980
02:38:55,299 --> 02:39:07,389
Three. Okay. Right there. And this is a three. One, two, three, eight. Two and eight. One, two,

981
02:39:07,389 --> 02:39:17,569
three, four, five, six, seven, eight. This is going to be one. Hello, everyone. How's the stream been?

982
02:39:17,569 --> 02:39:25,309
It's been really comfy and just cozy and hanging out. By the way, reiteration, Andy, because I don't

983
02:39:25,309 --> 02:39:32,079
know how many people have come and gone. We'll just give the quick TLDR again. TLDR. I just

984
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:38,639
pressed F4. Hopefully it didn't do anything weird. Okay. So I am not going to be streaming

985
02:39:38,639 --> 02:39:43,360
for three weeks. I'll be back on April 1st. There's a ton of projects, huge announcements to make,

986
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,520
some very exciting stuff. A lot of you guys probably going to really, really be into.

987
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:54,639
So keep on the lookout there. TLDR. I need to get my medical shit solved and treated. I need to get

988
02:39:54,639 --> 02:39:59,520
a treatment and a procedure for it because it's like six huge fucking projects that if I don't

989
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:05,620
get it solved, then it's going to be horrible to deal with. So I have to get on top of this

990
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:12,239
before we do any of these major, major projects among some other personal things. So there you

991
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:18,700
are. Got to get on top of this because I can't let it just sit around. I can't keep just like,

992
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:24,219
well, I don't, I did all this stuff six, seven months ago, eight, like a year ago. And I,

993
02:40:24,219 --> 02:40:28,620
there's nothing really, there's nothing really horribly wrong with me, but there's something

994
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:34,319
wrong with me that needs to be treated. Oh, there you go. I have to get on it because it's starting

995
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:52,610
to cause problems again. There we go. That's the one, daisy three, one, two, three. All right.

996
02:40:52,610 --> 02:41:06,559
That's done. What about here? One, two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I can't do it yet.

997
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:20,799
I remember this song. This is the four. I don't know. All right. Hold on. Close my one eye.

998
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:31,299
Oh, what the hell am I doing? Yeah. All this is nothing. All this is nothing too.

999
02:41:31,940 --> 02:41:51,329
Okay. Does that help me or three? Okay. Well that's done. Uh, one, two, three, somewhere over there.

1000
02:41:51,329 --> 02:42:16,219
12, one, two oatmeal. I think that's right. One, three, four. It's gotta be a three in here.

1001
02:42:16,860 --> 02:42:31,069
Wait this way. Two, one, two. Oh shit. That's it. That's two, one, two, one. And now that therefore

1002
02:42:31,069 --> 02:42:48,670
this has to be connected here to, it's a flamingo. One, three, four. There's nothing here.

1003
02:42:50,059 --> 02:43:00,079
One, three. Definitely not here. Okay. One, two, three, one, two, three. Third row here. Okay. Good.

1004
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:10,579
And then here's number four, two, two, two. Why does it have a weird like

1005
02:43:11,540 --> 02:43:24,299
puzzler? What's it called? Four, three, four. Is that the three or the four? I don't know.

1006
02:43:29,809 --> 02:43:46,059
Five, three, five, three. Here. Is it a swan or a stand? It could be like a staff. I don't know.

1007
02:43:46,059 --> 02:44:03,420
Could be something weird. One, three, four. Crane. Yeah. Two, two, 14 going down. Oh shit. Hold on.

1008
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:29,200
One, two. Well, 13, 14. I think I can deduce that. Yeah, that can be deduced. Four, three, four.

1009
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:47,180
The leg's kind of bent. Did I do it right? I think that's good. That looks a little weird.

1010
02:44:47,180 --> 02:45:13,739
I think that's correct. Done. Done. Three. This is toast. This is toast. Toast. Two. Three. Three.

1011
02:45:14,700 --> 02:45:28,430
What are we missing here? All right. What is it? A turkey? That's an ostrich. Very cool. All right.

1012
02:45:28,430 --> 02:45:38,270
I'm going to do something else real quick. I want to go to the workshop. I'm very curious about

1013
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:41,629
something. See, this is what I did. So these are all from the workshop and they're hidden.

1014
02:45:45,790 --> 02:45:59,040
What are these? Because they're hidden. I'm kind of afraid. So this is 78. This is 30 by 30.

1015
02:46:02,379 --> 02:46:21,579
I'm going to play it, I guess. Oh my God. This is so much. 30 by 30. So if it's 20, it means

1016
02:46:21,579 --> 02:46:30,770
it kept one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Two, three, four, five, six,

1017
02:46:30,770 --> 02:46:37,809
seven, eight, nine, 10. These are guaranteed. 23, 24. Oh, hold on. One, two, three, four, five,

1018
02:46:38,770 --> 02:46:50,639
six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three,

1019
02:46:52,129 --> 02:46:57,649
okay. 26, 27. Don't torture yourself with this. But what does this have to do with

1020
02:46:57,649 --> 02:47:08,100
Jerma? This is the final boss. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. I can get a lot of these right here.

1021
02:47:09,059 --> 02:47:18,239
22. Hold on. Let's see. One, two, space. One, two, space. 22 now. One, two, three, four, five,

1022
02:47:18,239 --> 02:47:31,379
six, seven, eight, two. Okay. So we go like this. It has to be there. Somewhere in there.

1023
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:47,280
Now check this out. We get a lot of info here. Oh, come on. Give me more data. Give me some more

1024
02:47:47,280 --> 02:48:00,780
data. 20. Is that 20? I don't know. One, two, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 15, 16, 17,

1025
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:26,620
18, 19, 20. Cool. 15 now. So down to here. 15, 14, 13, 11. Okay. And that's all the data that

1026
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:44,860
I have right now. It's going to be the J. We'll find out. All right. 22 now. So we can go,

1027
02:48:44,860 --> 02:48:51,500
let's count. So 22 minus eight on either side. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1028
02:48:52,879 --> 02:49:04,159
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There we go. I'm very curious of what this actually

1029
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:16,590
is. 21. Holy shit. What are the arrows on the top left for? I think to zoom in. 21. Okay. This is

1030
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:27,309
all the way across. 21 though. Is that, let's see, five, 10, 15, one, five, 10, 15, 20, 21,

1031
02:49:28,639 --> 02:49:42,989
two, three, four, five, six, seven. I mean, that's, I can do that. Six, five, again, five again,

1032
02:49:42,989 --> 02:49:57,579
four. Cool. Seven, seven, eight. What the hell is it? What is this? Is it just nothing? No,

1033
02:49:57,579 --> 02:50:09,680
it has to be something. It's not just nothing. Well, here's the five and then this is the six

1034
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:25,649
on two, three, four, five, six, nine. All right. What else can I do up top? Let's add these together.

1035
02:50:25,649 --> 02:50:35,809
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13. That would be 21 across. It's 16. So let's go like this.

1036
02:50:37,420 --> 02:50:47,860
Two space. Now we, so now that's 27. So if it's, wait, yeah, 27. We need 16. So 27

1037
02:50:49,889 --> 02:51:08,780
was, what am I doing? Right. Six, seven, eight, 14, 15, 16. So how many, it's 10,

1038
02:51:08,780 --> 02:51:28,239
11 spaces on either side. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 17. It's one, two, three, four, five, six,

1039
02:51:28,239 --> 02:51:36,750
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. One, two, three, four, five, six.

1040
02:51:38,209 --> 02:51:59,840
This is a pain in the ass. Five, 10, 15, 16, 10, nine, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Okay.

1041
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:15,500
One that's 22, right? 22. That'd be 20. So one space would be 28. So we need to count,

1042
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:26,899
um, we need to count 28 minus, we need to count six spaces on each side. One, two, three, four,

1043
02:52:26,899 --> 02:52:39,409
five, six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. That do anything for me? Well, this is

1044
02:52:39,409 --> 02:52:48,370
definitely part of his 13. One, two, three, that'd be four. That's, I have six, 13 here. Is that 13

1045
02:52:48,370 --> 02:53:05,950
the whole way across? Okay. 21, seven. I can't do that here. Uh, this one could be done. That's,

1046
02:53:05,950 --> 02:53:20,770
that's 21, 22, 23. Not yet. Three, 21, 22. Yeah, we can connect this, which would be one. That's

1047
02:53:21,739 --> 02:53:48,129
five. God damn it. Little green lines. I'm 21, 22. Jesus. I'm almost done with that. Okay.

1048
02:53:48,129 --> 02:54:06,909
It's a terraria screenshot. I don't know what it is. 22 across. Why are these here? Why are these

1049
02:54:06,909 --> 02:54:15,809
here? Why do they put these here? These, these don't belong here, right? No, they don't.

1050
02:54:15,809 --> 02:54:25,420
Across to your past self. Well, 19. Let's connect 18. Maybe not. Um, this is eight.

1051
02:54:26,139 --> 02:54:42,899
Now it's actually just eight across, which makes this six. It's going to be among us. I don't have

1052
02:54:42,899 --> 02:54:49,489
any, I don't think that's what this is. Any of the huge numbers I didn't do yet? 23.

1053
02:54:58,139 --> 02:55:08,780
These sell candles that smell like you. Oh my God. You psycho. Four, five, six. One, two, three,

1054
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:28,340
four, five, six. Oh, 21. What was it? 21, three, 21, one, three. Where's that at? 21, one, three.

1055
02:55:29,059 --> 02:55:43,299
What side is it on? Oh, 21, three. Okay. Oh, nice. We got even more data. Oh, I love when we unlock

1056
02:55:43,299 --> 02:55:57,090
data. Good. This is three, 15. That's done. And that's done. The whole thing's done. Okay. Cool.

1057
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:14,700
What is the, okay, come on. 26. I feel like I can do this one. 26, one. That's 26, 27, and 28.

1058
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:22,219
Let's go down here with space. So that would be, I need to count backwards if we're at 28.

1059
02:56:22,940 --> 02:56:30,930
So two, so one, two, and then the rest of these can be filled in. One, two, fill in the rest. Okay.

1060
02:56:30,930 --> 02:56:40,959
Get rid of these. I invested my life savings in bald coin currently filing for bankruptcy.

1061
02:56:50,370 --> 02:56:56,129
Seven, and then this is nine, nine. Is this nine right here? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

1062
02:56:56,129 --> 02:57:05,280
eight, nine. Perfect. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. How many are here? 10, 11,

1063
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:12,799
12. Some three on both sides. One, two, three. Fill those in. Cool. It's going to be 100% your

1064
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:26,290
dumpy. Well, so this is six and 12. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two, three, four,

1065
02:57:26,290 --> 02:57:33,229
five, six. It's definitely this one at least. 100%. Remember, it's just going to get high

1066
02:57:33,229 --> 02:57:45,680
and drink Heal for three weeks. Medical leaf my ass. Well, this is connected. Is there anything

1067
02:57:45,680 --> 02:58:02,350
I can do up here? All right. 20 and three. That's definitely connected. Six, eight, two.

1068
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:11,969
I can't believe you just read anything someone says. Why not? It's not like that big of a deal.

1069
02:58:12,530 --> 02:58:19,899
It's, they're just, all right. This, what about this 16? Let's get this one. There you go. There's

1070
02:58:19,899 --> 02:58:30,049
your one. So if it's 16, there's 30 spaces. That means 30, 29, 28, 27. So count 11 spaces. One,

1071
02:58:30,049 --> 02:58:52,020
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. These can be filled in. Mario. Watch it

1072
02:58:52,020 --> 02:59:13,059
just be a Mario like shitting thing. Like the ASCII art. Is he getting paid to play this?

1073
02:59:13,940 --> 02:59:21,409
Yes. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I am getting paid on this stream.

1074
02:59:22,209 --> 02:59:39,950
Not by the company that made this, but by some of you. Some of you have paid me today. Saved.

1075
02:59:41,950 --> 02:59:50,780
287. That'd be eight, seven. This is how many? What is here? 15. Wait, wait, wait. This is probably

1076
02:59:50,780 --> 02:59:59,379
15. Closed up. That's part of the 15. This is definitely part of the 14. Wait, it might not be.

1077
02:59:59,379 --> 03:00:19,229
I don't know that yet. That's a guess. All right. One, two, space. Is this all I could do here?

1078
03:00:19,229 --> 03:00:49,069
Yeah, I already did that. That would be one, two, three, four, five, six. What about these rows here?

1079
03:00:49,149 --> 03:00:59,459
This is nine. Nine, nine, four, five, 11, five, two, three, four, five.

1080
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:27,139
I connected there. What the hell even is this? Six, 14. I feel like I'm missing a bunch down here.

1081
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:37,520
18. Let's do this one. 18 and one. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

1082
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:47,709
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. It has to be there. One, two, three, four, five, six,

1083
03:01:49,229 --> 03:01:57,010
seven. That has to be blocked. Also seven. That's already blocked. Also six. One, two, three,

1084
03:01:57,010 --> 03:02:05,069
four, five, six. Okay, that's fine. This is also six. One, two, three, four, five, six. One, two,

1085
03:02:05,069 --> 03:02:21,780
three, four, five, six, five, five, nine, ten. Pot of coffee? Okay, hold on. This one here seems

1086
03:02:21,780 --> 03:02:42,739
like it could be done. 12, seven in a row. Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, three, seven. Damn it.

1087
03:02:42,739 --> 03:03:02,670
You need to start pretending. I don't think so. I'm overwhelming myself. This 17 right here.

1088
03:03:02,670 --> 03:03:10,989
Look at 17. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

1089
03:03:14,399 --> 03:03:25,780
Shit. One, two, four, six, seven, eight, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. I think that's it. I think so.

1090
03:03:26,659 --> 03:03:39,899
Then it's like two. Yeah, that's right. Eight, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three.

1091
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:56,239
Okay. All right, getting there. You can't assume the bottom two. I can assume. Yes, I can. Six,

1092
03:03:57,059 --> 03:04:05,389
12. This is broken up here. Let's just assume that this is one, two, three, four, five, six,

1093
03:04:05,389 --> 03:04:18,290
right? Right? Let's assume that. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

1094
03:04:19,170 --> 03:04:27,469
No, don't assume that. Let's just, we have to assume it. Forum two is in here. Wait a minute.

1095
03:04:27,469 --> 03:04:38,780
One, two, three, four, space two. I think this is going to be one, two, three, four, or one, two,

1096
03:04:38,780 --> 03:04:50,750
three, four, space two. This is so much better than bi-mode one. This is a great song.

1097
03:04:51,709 --> 03:05:05,329
Did we do this? Is this done? One, let's see. Five, 10, 15, 20, 22. No, it's 21. It can either

1098
03:05:05,329 --> 03:05:15,459
go up or down. I don't know why this is freaking me out so much. I think this is connected.

1099
03:05:16,420 --> 03:05:35,180
Okay, this has to be connected. This is part of the 14. 12, 6. This is part of the 12. All right,

1100
03:05:35,180 --> 03:05:42,159
what about up top here? 12, 10, 2. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Here we go. Is this 12 right here?

1101
03:05:42,159 --> 03:05:52,159
Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Nice. This is part of the 10. Three, four, five,

1102
03:05:52,159 --> 03:06:01,360
six, seven, eight, nine, 10. All right, I can't deduce that yet. Is this your face? It could be.

1103
03:06:02,079 --> 03:06:14,590
I don't know. Is it the chin? Is it the thing face? It could be either one of those.

1104
03:06:15,389 --> 03:06:25,309
All right, I got, what about this one? 13, 4, 2. 13, 4. Uh-oh. No, wait, that's one. Okay.

1105
03:06:25,870 --> 03:06:37,920
This could be the two or the four. It's probably the four. One, two, three, five, 10, 12, 13.

1106
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:55,040
Well, let's deduce it. 10, 11, 12, 13. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, 13.

1107
03:06:55,040 --> 03:07:01,659
I'm going to assume this is the four. I don't think that's the two.

1108
03:07:09,069 --> 03:07:19,200
All we have left is fours and threes, so this has to be connected. This could be this way first,

1109
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:26,270
so this is good. It's not singles. It has to be connected. Not singles. Wait, hold on. Wait,

1110
03:07:26,829 --> 03:07:39,299
I don't know that. That's not for sure. 2, 13. It can't be any of these. Oh, shit. There we go.

1111
03:07:39,299 --> 03:07:49,090
13. Oh, there's your three. Okay. One, two, three, four, five, six. Definitely not that way.

1112
03:07:54,879 --> 03:08:06,270
We got 16, two. There's, I got one here. Four. One, two, three, four. This has to be one of

1113
03:08:06,270 --> 03:08:25,069
these two, right? Is it the goblin face? It could be anything. It's part of the three. 19, 22, 26.

1114
03:08:26,270 --> 03:08:43,790
I love this song. This is awesome. Piss? Yeah, that's a good idea. I'm going to go piss.

1115
03:08:44,670 --> 03:10:59,229
Be right back. Go pee. See you in a minute. I swear to God. I swear to God. That was an animation.

1116
03:10:59,229 --> 03:11:18,030
That's cool. There's no escape from you guys. That was terrifying. Very, very cool. Let's

1117
03:11:18,030 --> 03:11:34,079
head back to it. That's so cute. What I was going to say is I swear to God, when I drink water,

1118
03:11:34,559 --> 03:11:39,840
you know, when you fill up like a Brita filter and it takes maybe five to 10 minutes, maybe 15

1119
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:45,280
minutes. But when you pour it at the top, it filters the water down at the bottom. I swear

1120
03:11:45,280 --> 03:11:52,559
to God, that's what my body does. I drink a water and my inner Brita filter just does it. Just takes

1121
03:11:52,559 --> 03:11:58,430
all the impurities and I piss it out within 10 minutes. Why do I pee? I have to pee so much.

1122
03:11:58,430 --> 03:12:07,549
Why do I pee all the time? Why am I constantly peeing? I think I process urine faster than a

1123
03:12:07,549 --> 03:12:22,399
Brita filter does. Anyways, you need to replace your filters. It's your kidneys. I've had my

1124
03:12:22,399 --> 03:12:27,520
kidneys checked. I've had my kidneys ultrasound. I've had blood work from my kidneys. There's

1125
03:12:27,520 --> 03:12:32,079
nothing wrong with them. They're like perfect. But how? They're not. They need to be more efficient.

1126
03:12:33,500 --> 03:12:46,559
Are they too efficient? All right. Anyways, where are we? Your kidneys are fucking jacked.

1127
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:58,590
All right. Here's the three. Close that up. Over efficient kidneys. We have some info here.

1128
03:12:59,489 --> 03:13:12,639
Three, nine, one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine. You can't do it. You're pregnant.

1129
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:26,180
Oh, shit. Hold on. So this is the eight or the seven? This is probably the seven.

1130
03:13:29,229 --> 03:13:36,000
Seven, none. Then we have eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1131
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:45,420
We got how many spaces do we have? Five, 10, 11, nine, eight. That. Perfect. So that's one. We got

1132
03:13:45,500 --> 03:13:55,729
a one and a three, one and a two, one and a two, one and a two, one and a two.

1133
03:13:58,209 --> 03:14:14,030
This is the six. Oh, two and a two, one, two. Oh, yeah. It's definitely the thing,

1134
03:14:14,030 --> 03:14:26,100
face. It for sure is. All right. So what about this? This is seven and the two is

1135
03:14:26,100 --> 03:14:40,139
somewhere over here. Is 12 fit here now? You cannot deduce it. We have to go like this.

1136
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:49,459
Three. All right. And then six, which is done already. What's left up here? Just a couple of

1137
03:14:49,459 --> 03:15:07,899
ones. Yeah, this is custom made. This is on the workshop. One, two. This is part of the two.

1138
03:15:10,020 --> 03:15:18,260
Therefore, this is part of the 10. That's 12. Yeah. OK. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1139
03:15:18,340 --> 03:15:39,340
10. Hey, wait, I can't be there and can't be there either. Wrong. No, it's not. It's the dump truck.

1140
03:15:39,340 --> 03:15:49,920
No, it's only the thing face. It's a baby elephant sitting on his hind legs. That's an amazing

1141
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:57,409
imagination you have. OK, cool. This is like looking at a cloud. Everybody sees something

1142
03:15:57,409 --> 03:16:13,899
different. Nineteen. Well, it's obviously not down there. It's a baby dragon. Oh, I could probably

1143
03:16:14,139 --> 03:16:26,959
see that. Wow. Well, this has to be the six because there's no way it has to be filled in.

1144
03:16:26,959 --> 03:16:44,370
What is this one? Wait, one. What did I do? One, two, six, two, six. Wait, where am I?

1145
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:56,000
One, two, six, two, 11. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Oh, God, this is wrong.

1146
03:16:56,000 --> 03:17:02,989
What happened? This is so many numbers. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, back up, back up, back up.

1147
03:17:02,989 --> 03:17:20,909
What did I take away? God, I need to like zoom in. Jesus, this is painful. Two, six,

1148
03:17:23,579 --> 03:17:38,959
two. No, that's correct. What? Two right here and then 11, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

1149
03:17:38,959 --> 03:17:57,870
eleven, ten, four, two. Okay, is there four in here? Anything else I can do in here in the meantime?

1150
03:17:57,870 --> 03:18:08,049
Three, nine. Okay, that's done. This is 14, three and a bunch of other stuff. This is 15, four,

1151
03:18:09,090 --> 03:18:23,389
a bunch of other stuff. 23, one, one, 17, two, one, 16, one. Oh, yeah, let's just together. Hold on.

1152
03:18:23,870 --> 03:18:34,290
One, two, three, four, five, six, 13, 14, 15. Let's see, so it can't be down here, right?

1153
03:18:37,180 --> 03:18:51,659
15, 16, so it can't be either one of these. That would be 14 this way. Is that correct?

1154
03:18:55,040 --> 03:19:06,719
11, 12, 13, 14. Hell yeah. I was done. One, two. This is nine. Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1155
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:34,000
And this one is, hold on, slow down. Eight, one, two, six, seven, eight, three, two, three, three.

1156
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:58,799
All right. 12, two. We're getting there. Almost did his that face. This is two. It'll be that way

1157
03:19:58,799 --> 03:20:06,479
and then it would be one, two, three, four. Jeremy, can you help me with my homework? Yes,

1158
03:20:06,479 --> 03:20:17,280
a multiple choice. Question one through 10. A, C, B, A, C, A, A, A, B, D, A, D, B, A, B, D, C,

1159
03:20:17,280 --> 03:20:44,780
A, C, D, B. Done. A, C, D, C. That was more than 10. Oops, that was like 12, whatever. Who has

1160
03:20:44,780 --> 03:20:54,000
multiple choice for homework? That would be so awesome. Oh my God, that would be incredible,

1161
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:59,489
wouldn't it? You don't have to get it right. You just have to hand it in. You imagine being in

1162
03:20:59,489 --> 03:21:07,409
homeroom and just writing like B, A, B, B, B, D, C, A, B, B, D, B, B. Done. Hand it in.

1163
03:21:07,409 --> 03:21:15,729
Does everybody have their homework? Yeah, I do. Here it is. Oh, okay. Thank you. Check for the day

1164
03:21:15,729 --> 03:21:36,159
of bringing your homework in. Do the bottom row? No, I can't do the bottom row. Why did you lie to

1165
03:21:36,159 --> 03:22:10,110
me? Bottom left. Five, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22. All right. Give it your best. Mine was better. All

1166
03:22:10,110 --> 03:22:44,620
right. 15, 5, 10, 15, 9, 3, 1, 11, 2. Now it's done. 16 this way. 2, that's done. Okay. Nice.

1167
03:22:45,180 --> 03:23:21,809
Oh shit. What happened here? What happened down here? 22, 16, 2 is busted. Is it?

1168
03:23:22,610 --> 03:23:48,139
Bottom right should not have Xs. Is this 22 though? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

1169
03:23:48,219 --> 03:24:04,510
19, 20. No, that was wrong too because it could know it was right. Then there's a 2 in here.

1170
03:24:08,799 --> 03:24:33,899
Um, there's nothing here. Or here. It can't be. 16 to the right one? 16 to the right one.

1171
03:24:34,860 --> 03:24:42,719
When are you gonna play The Sims 1? Um, when I get back. That's what the first thing will do.

1172
03:24:43,360 --> 03:24:52,479
I'm really looking forward to playing it. This is a pretty lackluster 500k stream. I didn't even

1173
03:24:52,479 --> 03:24:58,159
know I was at 500,000 followers. You told me that an hour ago. I didn't have time,

1174
03:24:58,159 --> 03:25:05,250
didn't really have time to prepare a 500,000 follower stream. Look, the archaeology stream

1175
03:25:05,250 --> 03:25:16,100
was for 500,000 followers. There you go. You're actually at 500. This is wrong somehow down here

1176
03:25:16,100 --> 03:25:50,399
and I don't know what the problem is. 19, can't be any of these. That's 3. Where are these last two?

1177
03:25:50,399 --> 03:26:09,629
The 1, 16 row, please. 1, 16 row. Here. What's wrong with it? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13,

1178
03:26:09,629 --> 03:26:26,659
14, 15, 16. What's wrong with it? What's the matter with it? Attach it to the wall.

1179
03:26:27,620 --> 03:26:41,180
You mean like this? Then, oh man, it's starting to get painful to look at. So many numbers.

1180
03:26:41,979 --> 03:26:51,680
Um, so then this would have to go away because that's your two, but then there's not 14 here

1181
03:26:51,680 --> 03:27:20,829
anymore. 11, 12, 13, 14, which 13, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16. Shit! On the right is not the two.

1182
03:27:22,430 --> 03:27:32,540
Look, there's like a hundred numbers on the screen. Bottom right two. This is, this is

1183
03:27:32,540 --> 03:27:49,549
fucked up though. 23 isn't right. God damn it, man. That connects to make 16. This does? Wait.

1184
03:27:52,059 --> 03:27:59,739
This is 16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

1185
03:28:01,840 --> 03:28:21,360
Two. That's over. There's still shit that's wrong. 18. These are connected. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1186
03:28:22,000 --> 03:29:03,579
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Uh oh. 9. This is 2, 4, 15. 1, 2, 3, 15, 4.

1187
03:29:05,409 --> 03:29:14,579
And 4, 4, 2. There's a 1 in there. Move 16 on the right down 1.

1188
03:29:18,799 --> 03:29:49,920
Like that. Like that. Do we got it? I don't know. Okay, so now that's 18.

1189
03:29:51,969 --> 03:30:09,489
Two in here somewhere. 5, 10, 6, 12, 8, 6, 1. That's blocked. But this is wrong. Oh wait,

1190
03:30:10,129 --> 03:30:32,370
change that. That's 5 now. This is 9. We believe in you. 2, 2, 2, 2 at 2, 2, 1, and 26, 1. What?

1191
03:30:33,569 --> 03:30:57,549
Somebody just said true? 26, 1, the 1 goes to the very bottom. 26, 1. 1 to the 1 to the 2.

1192
03:30:58,190 --> 03:31:20,430
1, 1 to the 2 to the 1. 2 to the 1 to the 1 to the 2 to the 6. Get out of here.

1193
03:31:21,149 --> 03:31:27,819
All right, so this is 16, 2. That's done. What about this one? This is 1, 2. This is the 3.

1194
03:31:29,010 --> 03:31:39,979
This is the 12. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. This is the 3. 1, 2, 3. Can't be here.

1195
03:31:39,979 --> 03:31:59,569
1, 2, 3. Can't be here. 5, 12. That one's done. This whole row is done. 4, 12, 1. Can't be any of

1196
03:31:59,569 --> 03:32:18,219
these. This one now is 1, 3, 5, 6. Is he streaming from his bathroom? Streaming from his bathroom.

1197
03:32:19,260 --> 03:32:43,889
I mean, I guess I'll give you a courtesy flush. Okay, where were we? Is this 12 in here? No,

1198
03:32:43,889 --> 03:32:53,469
I can't. This is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 12. Can't do that. This row's done. Do I have everything

1199
03:32:53,469 --> 03:33:07,219
blocked off that needs to be blocked off? 22, 1. This is it right here, right? Where else would

1200
03:33:07,219 --> 03:33:32,530
that 1 go? Here's the 2. It's with the 3 and then 20. That's done. Nice. Why highlight your message

1201
03:33:32,530 --> 03:33:47,120
when the word toilet will catch his eye? That's a really good point. 18. None of these make any sense.

1202
03:33:48,079 --> 03:34:04,979
I really love Germestreams. Toilet. What community Jake on? I want to talk to him. Well, that's too

1203
03:34:04,979 --> 03:34:10,719
bad. What do you want to talk to him about? Huh? What do you want to talk to him about?

1204
03:34:13,379 --> 03:34:21,120
Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet.

1205
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:44,159
Toilet. Let me just finish this and stop distracting me. 5, 10, 2. This is 11, 11, 5. All right.

1206
03:34:45,000 --> 03:34:47,000
six twelve

1207
03:34:47,159 --> 03:34:50,360
Okay, well, how many one two?

1208
03:34:54,659 --> 03:35:05,190
Wait nice three. Ah ha

1209
03:35:07,709 --> 03:35:12,010
aha

1210
03:35:12,010 --> 03:35:19,139
Require you you require my assistance. Ah ha ha ha ha ha

1211
03:35:19,819 --> 03:35:28,379
Ha that's not Trump. Why is that Trump?

1212
03:35:29,979 --> 03:35:34,239
Aha, you require my how is that Trump? What are you talking about?

1213
03:35:34,540 --> 03:35:46,190
eight six one two

1214
03:35:46,389 --> 03:35:54,010
three four five six one two

1215
03:35:54,610 --> 03:36:01,950
nine seven that's a four

1216
03:36:02,590 --> 03:36:07,559
this is a

1217
03:36:07,559 --> 03:36:08,879
two

1218
03:36:08,879 --> 03:36:11,840
two six three six

1219
03:36:12,479 --> 03:36:16,340
Show us the real Trump voice. Okay

1220
03:36:17,879 --> 03:36:20,360
Okay, I'm doing anything you want to do

1221
03:36:21,360 --> 03:36:24,799
Yeah, I don't have any other questions, please

1222
03:36:28,520 --> 03:36:40,620
two three four five six nine nine

1223
03:36:44,229 --> 03:36:47,819
eight nine

1224
03:36:47,819 --> 03:36:48,940
four

1225
03:36:48,940 --> 03:36:56,309
four

1226
03:36:56,309 --> 03:37:00,540
politics

1227
03:37:00,579 --> 03:37:08,309
That's my favorite cupcake flavor toilet

1228
03:37:12,639 --> 03:37:17,930
It's probably I'm less of a cupcake guy and more of a muffin guy

1229
03:37:17,930 --> 03:37:30,690
I think muffins are better cupcakes, especially when they're really dense. I like a nice dense blueberry muffin

1230
03:37:31,049 --> 03:37:38,629
That is what I want more wet less dry. I don't like a dry cake like cupcake. It's gonna be moist

1231
03:37:39,190 --> 03:37:43,069
So this is how I give you the my determination for what that would mean by this

1232
03:37:43,389 --> 03:37:46,489
If you take a muffin and you squish a piece of it between your fingers

1233
03:37:46,709 --> 03:37:53,719
If it sticks together and acts like a snowball like it squishes together and is wet. It's slightly damp

1234
03:37:54,079 --> 03:37:57,860
That's how you know, you've got a great muffin like slightly moist

1235
03:38:01,309 --> 03:38:08,100
blueberry moist dense muffin or chocolate chip or coffee cake a coffee cake muffin

1236
03:38:09,180 --> 03:38:14,129
Cupcakes are I think that junk I do because all you do is you just bite the top off and just

1237
03:38:14,450 --> 03:38:15,729
Put the right you don't even eat the rest of it

1238
03:38:15,729 --> 03:38:21,000
The actual cake part of a cupcake is a good part that I don't like to eat

1239
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:27,090
So why just might as well just take a spoonful of frosting out of the container. That's what I want

1240
03:38:27,090 --> 03:38:42,889
All right, let's connect this. This is five here one, two, three, four five finish that one yet

1241
03:38:42,889 --> 03:38:52,620
I don't know where these go. All right. There's my funny four here one, two, three four one, two, three four

1242
03:38:53,340 --> 03:39:02,360
one of these one three two four one three two four one

1243
03:39:02,879 --> 03:39:27,370
Be six. Oh shit. I can't be anywhere in here. Wait, hold on another two in here. That's actually pretty great

1244
03:39:27,370 --> 03:39:29,370
Yeah, it is. I sure he's passing really good

1245
03:39:29,729 --> 03:39:44,469
It's almost done over to this other side here. Anything be completed here five five eleven five

1246
03:39:48,389 --> 03:40:17,479
Well, this is this the best song in the whole album I love this one it's fantastic or I need to pick a place and just stay

1247
03:40:17,799 --> 03:40:23,860
These are all done. This is done. This is done. This whole everything over here is done. I need to look be looking this way

1248
03:40:24,659 --> 03:40:35,459
13 here we go. All right, one two, four 13

1249
03:40:36,139 --> 03:40:44,010
There we go to wait a minute. This is wrong

1250
03:40:45,579 --> 03:40:47,819
nine

1251
03:40:54,059 --> 03:40:56,549
What happened 13 is too long

1252
03:41:16,700 --> 03:41:28,549
Move 13 up one six one

1253
03:41:29,309 --> 03:41:30,549
two

1254
03:41:30,549 --> 03:41:51,270
I subverted and this would be one three two one three two two

1255
03:41:52,510 --> 03:42:01,260
takes care of that

1256
03:42:01,620 --> 03:42:12,059
nine seven two three

1257
03:42:12,739 --> 03:42:15,600
three six or

1258
03:42:15,959 --> 03:42:18,149
one

1259
03:42:18,149 --> 03:42:20,149
One one here in here

1260
03:42:20,270 --> 03:42:33,700
Someone made this. Yeah, they did. Does it kill him when the clock reaches an hour? I've never seen the song movie before. Oh

1261
03:42:39,469 --> 03:42:44,040
Six one six eight

1262
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:49,469
It's a three in here too. One two three

1263
03:42:51,350 --> 03:43:15,489
Shit, I don't know. Mmm, the one goes over here. I have no idea. All right, so I'm gonna concentrate

1264
03:43:16,090 --> 03:43:18,260
I'm not I'm just not I'm gonna stop talking

1265
03:43:18,780 --> 03:43:23,180
So I'm just gonna concentrate and stop speaking, but it's okay. You'll still hear things

1266
03:43:23,700 --> 03:43:26,020
Not like any of this commentary has changed at all

1267
03:43:26,579 --> 03:43:32,889
Shit, I don't know

1268
03:43:32,889 --> 03:43:43,790
Mmm, shit. I don't know if the one goes over here

1269
03:43:44,270 --> 03:43:50,569
The one goes over here. I have no idea

1270
03:43:54,950 --> 03:44:04,620
Mmm, the one goes over here. I have no idea shit. I don't know. I have no idea shit. I don't know. Mmm

Just solve it. What are you? What do you think? I'm doing it six one two, three, four, five six

1274
03:44:45,040 --> 03:44:46,239

1275
03:44:46,239 --> 03:44:59,430
Is it two in here? There's another six in here. Mmm

1276
03:45:03,670 --> 03:45:05,819

03:45:05,819 --> 03:45:10,350

Just X amount. I can't like I have to like hold my eyes closed for a second

1324
03:50:55,979 --> 03:51:03,819
What am I looking at turns fucking music off? I feel like I'm just stuck in a fucking elevator

1332
03:51:44,540 --> 03:52:17,459
Wouldn't remove all of the left eye. Well, you mean my left or his left. I mean his left. Where's the other two?

1333
03:52:19,899 --> 03:52:23,000

1334
03:52:23,680 --> 03:52:29,819
Okay. Um

03:52:31,209 --> 03:52:35,260
This is a really bad stream. Hope you have a great three weeks Jeremy. Good night

1336
03:52:35,860 --> 03:52:38,809

1337
03:52:39,409 --> 03:53:02,329
You could have just said the second part. Fuck your eyeball out. Alright skip to get other music. Give me out of the elevator

1338
03:53:06,329 --> 03:53:08,329
I guess this is where it's name

1339
03:53:16,469 --> 03:53:18,469
Sims 1

1340
03:53:21,600 --> 03:53:24,059
Where I

1341
03:53:24,059 --> 03:53:29,579
Can't even look I don't know. I'm lost completely. I'm like I'm my brains over

1342
03:53:29,579 --> 03:53:39,159
My brains fried is done. I'm so close. But like I can't finish it

1343
03:53:39,399 --> 03:53:42,399
This is like when you study right before the exam and you get to the point

1344
03:53:42,399 --> 03:53:46,879
We're at like the flashcard number 20 like 30 50 500 and you're like, I can't look at this anymore

1345
03:53:46,879 --> 03:53:50,950
If I like went to sleep and woke up and came back, I probably would beat this

1346
03:53:51,569 --> 03:53:57,950
one

1347
03:53:57,950 --> 03:54:06,180
The fact that I have to look all the way down the screen. Okay, two three six four one

1348
03:54:06,700 --> 03:54:08,700
There's two ones in here somewhere

1349
03:54:25,120 --> 03:54:31,180
There's like two in the wrong spot and I'll just never figure it out top of the right eye should be filled in

1350
03:54:31,180 --> 03:54:34,100
Yeah, like in here, but it's like everything's moved around

1351
03:54:34,899 --> 03:54:42,370
Go back to the way it was before hold on like back here before I freaked out

1352
03:54:42,930 --> 03:54:53,889
One four five four row delete the left eye one four five four row

1353
03:54:54,510 --> 03:55:02,010

1354
03:55:02,010 --> 03:55:09,500
Your other left. Well, yeah, I thought you guys are on my left

1355
03:55:10,059 --> 03:55:23,139
So wait, so there's nothing he there's nothing here

1356
03:55:23,620 --> 03:55:26,950
How could there be nothing there?

1357
03:55:26,989 --> 03:55:31,920
What's wrong with this? I?

1358
03:55:31,959 --> 03:55:55,670
Okay, so there's a one here. I need four

1359
03:55:56,549 --> 03:55:58,549

1360
03:55:58,629 --> 03:56:00,350
one two

1361
03:56:00,350 --> 03:56:02,350
one two

1362
03:56:02,629 --> 03:56:04,870
That right, I think

1363
03:56:06,989 --> 03:56:18,760
Exactly, that's correct. There's another one

1364
03:56:19,440 --> 03:56:35,829
Okay, there's this two one four four three has an incorrect X one four four three

1365
03:56:36,450 --> 03:56:48,399
One four five four still wrong. It's so close. I just had it's it's just pissing me off

1366
03:56:49,000 --> 03:57:08,739

03:57:16,290 --> 03:57:22,250
Six it's just so much fucking info three six six. This is done. Like this is correct

1368
03:57:24,200 --> 03:57:33,299
That's it. There's no more you can't put the sixes anywhere else. This is done, too. It has to be right

1369
03:57:33,299 --> 03:57:44,020
I can't put this over here. The mouth is wrong. What the top row is wrong

1370
03:57:48,809 --> 03:58:09,059
I'm not gonna reset

1371
03:58:09,059 --> 03:58:15,260
I just I'm at that point where there's like five things wrong and really specific place and it requires me moving the whole fucking

1372
03:58:15,340 --> 03:58:36,399

That kind of has to be in here

1379
03:59:08,030 --> 03:59:13,729
Get rid of all the X's in one four four three all of them

1380
03:59:14,489 --> 03:59:28,200
Shift the nine on the top row one space to the right

1381
03:59:29,159 --> 03:59:45,719
Okay, now what?

1382
03:59:45,840 --> 03:59:47,120

I really appreciate the help because I was stuck and I was locked

1434
04:08:20,299 --> 04:08:29,129
Well 13 so we can do if we deduce that this could happen to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

1435
04:08:29,530 --> 04:08:37,629
It's the whole damn thing. It's been deduced 10 11 12 13 14

1436
04:08:38,229 --> 04:08:41,350
We can deduce that

1437
04:08:41,549 --> 04:08:54,100
Yeah, one is that okay. You're the one in yesterday. I mean, I'm on Pacific time. So all right, what else we got?

1438
04:08:54,780 --> 04:09:01,629

Aha, there it is

1637
04:36:33,340 --> 04:36:36,990
It's so fixable

1638
04:36:44,069 --> 04:36:56,450
It's the original blue one too, I'm actually here. Oh, hold on. I'm curious if I get rid of that most popular

1639
04:36:57,290 --> 04:37:01,639
Suspended how about top rated?

1640
04:37:04,909 --> 04:37:06,909
size size will do

1641
04:37:07,750 --> 04:37:11,650
Let's do like ten and by like ten

1642
04:37:12,250 --> 04:37:14,840
What's the top rated ten by ten one on the store?

1643
04:37:15,279 --> 04:37:19,020
This is the top rated one of the on the store and then on the workshop

04:37:19,540 --> 04:37:30,909
In nine, all right two zero two two

1645
04:37:31,869 --> 04:37:33,150

1648
04:37:52,459 --> 04:38:29,240
Okay, what is it? Hi. Oh, there's the part this pie. Cool. All right. What about this one?

1649
04:38:29,240 --> 04:38:36,759
That was it. That's 600 votes over this one. It's not a level in the game

1650
04:38:37,119 --> 04:38:46,139
Could be what that off this off all blocked off. All right, so six I can just do that whole row

1651
04:38:47,700 --> 04:38:50,009
four five six seven eight

1652
04:38:50,290 --> 04:38:52,290
We have six seven eight

1653
04:38:52,650 --> 04:38:57,169
So let's do just do this one two, three, four five six

1654
04:38:58,049 --> 04:39:00,290
Seven therefore one on each side

1655
04:39:00,970 --> 04:39:03,979
All right, that's two

1656
04:39:04,299 --> 04:39:12,830
Hmm, two three. Oh that toilet. How far P can you go? I don't know

1657
04:39:14,919 --> 04:39:19,529
another six

1658
04:39:24,310 --> 04:39:28,099
Five six seven, it's gonna be one on each side

1659
04:39:29,000 --> 04:39:30,479

04:39:30,479 --> 04:39:34,159
That's one also a one also a one

1661
04:39:35,200 --> 04:39:36,680
one

1662
04:39:36,680 --> 04:39:51,180
Also a one. This is Marvel music. No, this is Arthas Menethil this theme song from Hearthstone. I guess

1663
04:40:00,150 --> 04:40:02,150
2532

1664
04:40:03,009 --> 04:40:06,400

One two, three, four five six seven eight one on each side. Thank you very much

1666
04:40:14,580 --> 04:40:19,849
This is the this is generic shit

1667
04:40:20,409 --> 04:40:23,540
What you don't think that?

1668
04:40:28,970 --> 04:40:33,139
That's come on that they could be anybody's song

1669
04:40:33,860 --> 04:40:50,830
Mickey Mouse could walk out to this music and it probably makes sense one one one two. There's the two

1670
04:40:54,790 --> 04:40:56,790
How's that how do I have nothing up there

1671
04:41:02,409 --> 04:41:05,029
done it and

1672
04:41:05,659 --> 04:41:08,779
It has to be down here no else place it could be

1673
04:41:09,419 --> 04:41:21,450
No, wait, one, two, three, four five. Oh shit. There we go. That's better

1674
04:41:22,209 --> 04:41:27,060
That's better. What is this? It's like a guy with a sword

1675
04:41:27,900 --> 04:41:33,000
What is that? It's Arthas Menethil

1676
04:41:33,520 --> 04:41:36,080
King George

1677
04:41:36,360 --> 04:41:43,979
All right, we'll do one more. I'm gonna do one more and then I'm gonna get gone

1678
04:41:44,819 --> 04:41:51,939
We will reiterate one more time. What's gonna happen over the next few weeks. I know you guys have a lot of questions. I

1679
04:41:52,939 --> 04:41:59,259
Know you guys have a lot of things that you are want to ask and I cannot answer them right now

1680
04:41:59,259 --> 04:42:01,630
I will answer them very soon

1681
04:42:01,950 --> 04:42:18,340
Who's free?

1682
04:42:19,419 --> 04:42:24,729
Six one two, three four five six

1683
04:42:25,369 --> 04:42:37,630
You're getting what is a dog. I think it's like a dog face

1684
04:42:38,130 --> 04:42:46,919
This looks like a dog. I won one one one. That was so quick. That was that was speed run

1685
04:42:47,680 --> 04:42:52,040
graph giraffe with breakfast

1686
04:42:52,680 --> 04:42:59,340
No more hard stone. We'll go back to heroes of mind magic

1687
04:43:00,740 --> 04:43:04,060
the end

1688
04:43:04,060 --> 04:43:15,709
Last one. I love it. It feels so good to do that. Okay

1689
04:43:17,069 --> 04:43:18,270
Nine

1690
04:43:18,270 --> 04:43:23,009
Okay, we can get these

1691
04:43:23,009 --> 04:43:30,020
Sixes, let's see one two, three, four, five six

1692
04:43:32,139 --> 04:43:34,139
Seven just one on each side cool

1693
04:43:35,259 --> 04:44:02,209
Be there this is the blood elf theme and heroes of my magic. I have three click with your middle mouse button toilet. Oh

1694
04:44:03,549 --> 04:44:05,110
Oh

1695
04:44:05,110 --> 04:44:08,310
Whoops, sorry

1696
04:44:08,669 --> 04:44:12,380
Would have been nice if I was using that the whole time

1697
04:44:12,900 --> 04:44:16,229
That was that's too bad. But whatever

1698
04:44:16,630 --> 04:44:32,680
One there's three

1699
04:44:33,639 --> 04:44:37,650
Do the middle finger

1700
04:44:38,369 --> 04:44:44,709
three

1701
04:44:44,709 --> 04:44:49,380
No

1702
04:44:49,540 --> 04:45:16,659
All right. Good morning. Good morning to you, too. All right, what is it? Oh, it's a magic bunny

1703
04:45:17,220 --> 04:45:21,580
Yeah, I all right

1704
04:45:21,580 --> 04:45:28,389
Let's make sure we reiterate this one more time. You know, I'm like, I'm repeat myself Andy tonight, but I kind of have to

1705
04:45:28,950 --> 04:45:30,950
Only I want to make sure everyone knows what's going on

1706
04:45:32,759 --> 04:45:35,959
If you missed the first part of the stream you missed the middle part of the stream

1707
04:45:36,400 --> 04:45:46,020
Get the credits rolling too. By the way, there was a lot of community subs. Thank you everybody. Let's go over this very quickly

1708
04:45:46,740 --> 04:45:52,979
Let's go. No, why don't I just go I got to talk about this one more time

1709
04:45:53,540 --> 04:45:58,139
So I'm gonna be taking some absence here

1710
04:45:59,580 --> 04:46:05,020
I'm going to finalize and get to the absolute treatment plan of

1711
04:46:05,740 --> 04:46:12,279
This chest and back problem that I've had what's likely to happen is over the next few weeks

1712
04:46:12,279 --> 04:46:15,959
I'm going to try to get either intercostal

1713
04:46:16,560 --> 04:46:18,990
Injections to shut it up

1714
04:46:19,509 --> 04:46:23,990
Probably do it a few places somewhere along the spine

1715
04:46:25,029 --> 04:46:32,119
Trigger points and an intercostal potential intercostal nerve injection. I'm gonna try it. I want to try it

1716
04:46:32,200 --> 04:46:33,639
I want to do it

1717
04:46:33,639 --> 04:46:36,709
Because there's a lot of stuff going on in 2021

1718
04:46:38,220 --> 04:46:41,740
The I'm essentially we're we're hitting the ground running on a lot of projects

1719
04:46:42,299 --> 04:46:46,700
So there are at least four or five more streams

1720
04:46:47,500 --> 04:46:51,189
Like the archaeology stream that you will see within the next six months

1721
04:46:52,869 --> 04:46:57,189
This is not like oh, yeah, there's worse. You know, I get like a year when we do something like that again

1722
04:46:58,569 --> 04:47:04,459
Because of the nature of doing as many of these as we kind of can in 2021. I have to get this under control

1723
04:47:05,900 --> 04:47:13,000
I also have some family stuff and some personal stuff to take care of too. So this is likely to be the final break

1724
04:47:14,490 --> 04:47:15,689
before I

1725
04:47:15,689 --> 04:47:22,040
Hopefully get over this bullshit with my back and chest and everything and if it's not then i'll keep doing it

1726
04:47:22,040 --> 04:47:26,279
But this i'm at least gonna go get the injections. I'm gonna i'm gonna just I talked to my doctor about it

1727
04:47:26,520 --> 04:47:29,909
We're setting up a plan. I'm just gonna be like

1728
04:47:30,630 --> 04:47:32,970
Just stick me just stick them in me

1729
04:47:34,470 --> 04:47:38,619
Because I want to get I need to get a treatment plan. I have to it's been too long with this shit

1730
04:47:38,700 --> 04:47:44,950
It's been three years now, obviously I ruled out all the bad stuff and that's what I was doing the two or three months

1731
04:47:44,950 --> 04:47:48,470
I was gone ruling out everything that could be terrible

1732
04:47:50,360 --> 04:47:53,099
But it's time to take care of it

1733
04:47:53,099 --> 04:47:58,759
So I will see you on april 1st and on april 2nd

1734
04:47:58,840 --> 04:48:02,040
I will have a shitload of announcements some stuff you're probably really going to look forward to

1735
04:48:02,360 --> 04:48:08,709
I know you have a lot of questions about the streams that you may have seen about roto beasts

1736
04:48:09,500 --> 04:48:14,540
Just hold off. I will give you way more details. There'll be a lot of announcements in a few weeks

1737
04:48:19,659 --> 04:48:22,139
We'll see what I come back with on the 1st of april. Okay

1738
04:48:24,310 --> 04:48:27,189
So again, if people don't know what's going on just you tld arm

1739
04:48:30,169 --> 04:48:34,549
I really hate to take all this time off because i'm sure you guys all know we just you know

1740
04:48:34,549 --> 04:48:41,020
We passed 500 000 followers. The channel is as big as it's ever been and that's kind of like the I guess

1741
04:48:41,099 --> 04:48:44,439
I'll be real with you. That's kind of the sad part about this for me is

1742
04:48:45,880 --> 04:48:50,840
The channel is like at peak popularity right now like the last like eight to ten months

1743
04:48:51,689 --> 04:48:55,959
And i'm just like fucking off every three months or so, you know what I mean?

1744
04:48:56,759 --> 04:48:59,240
So that's like kind of sad but at the end of the day

1745
04:49:01,080 --> 04:49:05,639
I never cared about that shit. Anyways, you know this channel could have 5 000 viewers

1746
04:49:06,360 --> 04:49:08,139
2 000 viewers or 20 000 viewers

1747
04:49:08,220 --> 04:49:12,599
I'm still gonna just keep doing the things that I do and if you think it's fun if you're here then

1748
04:49:13,750 --> 04:49:18,020
Well, I hope you enjoy it. I hope you like this stuff that we're doing here. Um 20k or 2k

1749
04:49:18,099 --> 04:49:30,819
It doesn't matter but not less than 2k. Absolutely not less than 2k. Uh, and I again before I go

1750
04:49:31,540 --> 04:49:34,229
There was just so much

1751
04:49:35,080 --> 04:49:40,459
It was like an overwhelming amount of things that we were seeing for the stream for the archaeology thing and i'm just so happy that

1752
04:49:41,110 --> 04:49:44,599
um a lot of people involved in that project got like the

1753
04:49:45,080 --> 04:49:50,310
Attention and the recognition that they deserved and i'm really really happy about the nevada science center stuff, too

1754
04:49:50,549 --> 04:49:55,819
So I will be back on april 1st. I'll see you soon. Thanks for watching everybody

1755
04:49:56,650 --> 04:49:59,849
This should be the final time that I disappear for more than a couple weeks at a time

1756
04:50:00,169 --> 04:50:06,470
And when I get back, maybe i'll maybe i'll fucking run a lap around my room and tell you that I got the

1757
04:50:07,319 --> 04:50:21,700
Intercostal injections take care of yourselves. I'll be back on april 1st. Good luck to you all as well. Have fun

1758
04:50:22,840 --> 04:50:26,919
