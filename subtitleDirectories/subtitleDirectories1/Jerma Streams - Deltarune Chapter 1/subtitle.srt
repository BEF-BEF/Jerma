1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:13,220
Oh, look who it is. It's Twitch chat. Hi guys. Uh, hold on. I gotta move my mic. Wait, wait, wait.

2
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,950
Hey, thank you for waiting. Your patience is unmatched, everybody.

3
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,100
Will I be watching green screen edits? No. I want to make sure I make this very clear, very,

4
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:51,020
very clear. Uh, green screen edits are going to be only designated for the green screen movie

5
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:55,579
night. They might be more than two. They might be even more than that. I might have to do more

6
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,759
than three, but, uh, we're not going to watch them on stream. We're not going to watch them

7
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:11,540
after the stream. It's, we're going to get a good, clean, dedicated movie night. Not even

8
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,909
one, not even one. Oh, we got it. We got to hold onto them. That's the specific reason

9
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:27,140
why we did it in the first place is to have like a big movie night. So this is a

10
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:37,349
little too loud, ain't it? Mr. Like Birdman is a little loud. Am I sick? I was a little stuffy

11
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:48,260
this morning, but I'm good. It should clear out here in a minute or so. What do I think of

12
00:01:48,260 --> 00:02:01,379
Fallout 76? I haven't played Fallout 76. I heard it's not good though. I've heard it

13
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:07,079
is very, very, very much a broken video game. I don't really have any intention to play it.

14
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:16,259
Not really. That's an understatement. Yeah, I just don't, I didn't even attempt to play it.

15
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,810
But the thing that we're going to attempt to play tonight is something that we've been

16
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,250
talking about for a couple of weeks now. And I knew at some point I wanted to play it. So

17
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,879
we're going to do it tonight. And I know that this schedule has been so odd.

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,199
I've been streaming a lot more frequently, but it's probably going to stay like this.

19
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,900
I have not yet decided on how the hell I'm going to, what the new schedule will be.

20
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:59,030
I don't know. I mean, maybe we'll never stop streaming like Monday to Monday.

21
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,580
I'm kidding. That's not going to happen. Yeah. If you don't, if I played Undertale on stream

22
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,659
long time ago and I thought it was fun. I hope if you want to stick around and watch this,

23
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,550
this is just kind of an extra stream that I knew I wanted to do. So if you don't want to know,

24
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:34,389
if it's spoilers and all that shit and you don't care, then see you soon. Thanks for stopping by.

25
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:44,460
So let's get it on the screen. It's kind of odd to capture because it just like starts.

26
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:53,669
It's just, it just starts. So I got to turn this off and we're going to go.

27
00:03:54,229 --> 00:04:05,159
It's a three hour game. Well, I don't even know. Is it? Here comes a three hour stream.

28
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,659
No, don't worry. I'm going to like really, I'm going to really drag this out.

29
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,569
Every opportunity that I can stop and make like a 30 minute conversation. I'm kidding.

30
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:24,709
Okay. It's got a weird name too. Like your computer thinks it's a virus, right? This is

31
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:28,069
not a virus, right? Is this, is this his way to make everybody, to make a big joke out of

32
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:36,329
this? All right, here it comes. It should, it should show up on the screen very shortly here.

33
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:40,839
Uh, any second now. There it is. Hey, are you there?

34
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:59,509
Welcome to Undertale 2. Are we connected? I remember that. That's the heart. Excellent.

35
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:06,740
Truly excellent. This is, this is 18 years in the making, by the way. He started this when

36
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,009
he was one. He started coding this when he was like, I think four and a half months old.

37
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:30,360
We may begin. First, you must create a vessel. Select the head that you prefer.

38
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,420
No, but this is more like me, right? Is that more like me? I've got like a long,

39
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,439
skinny chin and the hair that comes down. That's like hair going up, going down. That's

40
00:05:52,439 --> 00:06:09,610
like a long chin. Select the torso that you prefer. Can you also, can you also customize kill

41
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,439
streaks? Well, I don't understand. All right. Well, I'm just making Charlie Brown.

42
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:29,939
Select the legs that you prefer. This is the same thing. What's the difference? A fat left

43
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:43,060
leg or a fat right leg? I'm just going to go with this one. This is your body. Do you

44
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:59,459
accept it? Sure. Excellent. You have created a wonderful form. Now let us shape its mind

45
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:06,339
as your own. Where the hell is Sans, man? I don't even like this. What is its favorite food?

46
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:18,220
Sweet, soft, sour, salty. Sans, where's Sans? Pain. Cold. No, my favorite food. I'm doing

47
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,829
this as if it's me. Okay. And whatever one is the closest to Sans is the one I'm going

48
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:30,379
to pick. I don't, I think I'm a salt kind of person. Salty. Sansy. You know, your favorite

49
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:42,279
blood type. Uh, D is not a blood type. That's like the funny answer. Or is that O? Is that

50
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:55,939
O? I don't even know what my blood type is. What is my blood type? There's no blood type

51
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:01,689
C. That's D, but that's not an O. Look at the O's up there. Look up under, see blood?

52
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:13,060
I think I'm a, I think I'm a, I think I'm a dual blood citizen. What color does it like most? Red,

53
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:24,120
blue, blue or green? Oh, right. Like that's a tough one. This is actually hard because these

54
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:36,519
are my two favorite colors. Am I determining how much HP I have by doing this and how many

55
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,159
intellect and like mystic points I get or something? It's going to be, it's going to

56
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,519
be, uh, I painted my office screen. It has to be green. It's going to, it's blue. I,

57
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,000
can I go back? Please give it a gift. Kindness, mind, ambition, bravery, voice.

58
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:56,470
Because you know, I got that one. How do you feel about your creation? It will not hear.

59
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:04,250
Well, I've got to tell you, I think it has a little bit of hope from that first game.

60
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:12,389
Remember that one? Determination. Where's that one? Where's Sans? Where's Sans? How do I feel

61
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:17,929
about your creation? I'm kind of afraid of it. I don't know if it could like much jump

62
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:28,629
at the screen. Have you answered honestly? Uh, yes. Yes, I have. Nice Peter Griffin voice.

63
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:35,429
Oh, Lois. Lois. You acknowledge the possibility of pain and seizure. What?

64
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:46,250
No, I have to acknowledge the fact that it's going to make it pain and seizure.

65
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:57,539
Is this, is this telling me that it's going to be flashy? No. Understood. Name your vessel.

66
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:57,269
Uh, me. Whoops. It's me. Who made it? No, no, no, no, no. I did. I made this. Excellent.

67
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:13,509
All right. Truly excellent. Thank you. I did this. Me. I. Your answers. Your wonderful

68
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:23,659
creation. Uh-oh. Will now be discarded. No one can choose who they are in this world.

69
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:41,580
Your name is Chris Sans. Uh, what's, how do I? Chris. Chris, if you do not wake up,

70
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:49,820
we'll be late for school, Chris. Oh, that's uh, that's Abigail. I will wait outside for

71
00:11:49,820 --> 00:12:08,820
you. All right. Okay. I got my Legend of Zelda. The drawer is mostly empty except for a school

72
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,779
cross-country cert with a tear in it, a tear. Okay. So am I like in high school or something?

73
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:24,070
Closed draw. It's a beautiful day outside. There are CDs under the bed. Classical jazz,

74
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,350
religious scuff. There's also a game console. It is one normal controller and one knockoff

75
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,289
one. Stay, just stay. Definitely takes place in the nineties. It's a computer desk. There

76
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:45,879
are many boxes under it filled with old books. Okay. What about the bird? It's a red rag wagon

77
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,769
with a rusty bird cage in it. Looks like it's seen quite a few crashes. Why do you have a

78
00:12:51,769 --> 00:13:01,450
bird cage? Ragged. There's a ragged in here. A cactus. There's not much to say about it.

79
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,970
There are crayons in the drawer. Their labels have long faded and there's no green.

80
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,289
Oh, just like the nineties. It's only you.

81
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:22,629
The door is locked. Okay. Bookshelf. There are many books. Tales of snails. A storybook.

82
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:30,259
Snails do not have tails. A scientific reputation. Can snails help your garden? Not

83
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:37,179
really. And a signed copy of the history of humans and monsters by Gerson Boom. That new

84
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:42,330
character that everyone's going to fall in love with. Wait, what about? That's it.

85
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,149
You looked inside the sink cupboard. There's a can of Icy's Cool Boys body spray. Spray

86
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,110
for the boys. Flamin' hot pizza flavor. It seems to be almost entirely full.

87
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:15,929
That's good. Yeah, Toby, you already got me. It's a toilet. Flush it. You flush the toilet.

88
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:46,809
Chris, is everything all right in there? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to be the first person that finds

89
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:55,289
the secret with the toilet. Sans is going to come out of there. Chris, what are you doing

90
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:01,539
in there? You did not put a bath bomb in the toilet again, did you? I can't wait until Sans

91
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:15,019
comes out here and he goes. Can't wait until he does that. On the shower ledge, there's a

92
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:22,789
small container of apple scented shampoo and a gallon size container of pet shampoo.

93
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:36,100
All right, can I leave the bathroom? Wait, what if I say no? It's good to conserve water. Oh,

94
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:45,700
whoops. There's a photo on the fridge. It's of you, your mother, and your brother.

95
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:52,759
Okay, so I have brother. Is my brother going to be the guy from the first game?

96
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,840
Oh, by the way, I think this is a sequel to Undertale. I don't know. It might be.

97
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,240
It's emitting a pleasant floral scent. Cookie cutters for gingerbread monsters and gingerbread

98
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,600
humans. Cinnamony batter caked up. There's a cinnamony batter caked on the stove top.

99
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,370
There's some white fur stuck in the drain. You got to look at everything.

100
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:28,740
It's a landline phone, but you already have a cell phone. It's a chariol, the beloved living

101
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:37,110
room chair. All right, TV. All right, this hopefully this is like GTA. GTA. And there's

102
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,389
like a shitload of TV channels. It's the TV doesn't seem to even be plugged in anymore.

103
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,059
Chris, there you are. We might still be able to make it. Here comes the first song. It's

104
00:16:54,059 --> 00:17:01,460
a beautiful day today, is it not? I hope it stays this way when we when Asriel visits next

105
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,759
week. But I wonder after the excitement of university, will we still enjoy coming home to

106
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:18,220
this little town of Undertale? I remember those cats. I remember that girl from the Muppets

107
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:26,789
in the electric blue balloon band, whatever it's called. No, Dr. T in the electric mayhem.

108
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:55,319
We're going to school. I'm late. So does everyone have a...

109
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,960
Oh, Chris, we thought you weren't coming today. We're doing... No, this is... I know this

110
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,480
person. We're doing group projects this month. Oh, so walk around and find a partner. Okay.

111
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:35,619
The snake. Chris, you know, Jockington and Caddy are always partners. We're the ultimate

112
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,980
academic duo ever since our first gym class. It was hula hoop day and they ran in a hoops

113
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:49,880
for us. So she used me instead. That's our origin story. But I hardly know her.

114
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,079
Hahaha. What do you think of that one? Funny, right? No? Well, I got news for you, pal. I

115
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:33,049
already got a partner. Oh, I'm not doing this one. No, I'm not doing it. Black and white

116
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:40,970
hard-boiled egg. Sadly seems like it already has a partner. What about Falco? Chris lit again,

117
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:45,609
I see. Oh, you need a partner. Sorry, I'm already partners with the second smartest student.

118
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:50,970
Oh, wait. Chris, now that I think about it, your unique skill set might help a lot on this

119
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:58,390
assignment. What? I actually wanted to get an A. All right, easy. Settle down here, daffy duck.

120
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,180
Hey, Chris, what's up? Did you lose your pencil again? Here, you want the candy cane

121
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:10,630
one or the one with the lights on it? Huh? You want to be partners? Birdly already asked me,

122
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,549
but I could ask his Alphys if we could make a group of three. I'll ask if you're sure. Not

123
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:23,670
yet. I'm going to be the third partner here. What about cat sip from final fantasy seven?

124
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:34,230
I'll click, click, tap, tap, take. I can't. I have to. Okay, I have to let go. Ask her

125
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:40,519
for this. What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I watching on my phone? It's schoolwork, of

126
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:47,000
course. Animated schoolwork. And hey, Chris, have you chosen a partner yet? I want to be partners

127
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:55,740
with the snake. This is kind of not fair. If you can't get anyone, maybe your mom will be your

128
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:09,509
partner again. Okay, where is haymaker? No, no, let's be partners. Okay, I'll ask. Miss Alphys,

129
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:14,279
is it okay if we have a group of three? No, I don't want to approve of this. Abort.

130
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Well, but Chris doesn't have a... Noelle, what were you saying? She was saying we're five-y alone.

131
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:31,140
I just wanted to know if... Noelle, can you please speak up? Uh-oh. Hi, five-five-y.

132
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:44,309
Five-oo-five-y. Am I late? Oh, no, no, you're fine. We were just choosing partners for the

133
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:57,980
next group project. And five-ee-five-y, you're with Chris. Great. Now that everyone's here,

134
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:11,420
I'll write the assignment down. Has anyone seen the chalk? This is the third time it's gone missing,

135
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:19,130
and you all know I can't start class without some chalk. How about this? If no one speaks up,

136
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:28,779
everyone gets in trouble. Anyone, please? This teacher sucks. Hey, there might be a box in

137
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:35,259
the supply closet. Miss Alphys, why don't you just, uh, sell... Oh, five-oo-five-y and I.

138
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,180
Good idea, Noelle. Since you came in last, five-oo-five-y, why don't you go and get it

139
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:59,500
for me? You can't keep this up, I know. And Chris, can you go with her and make sure she

140
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:15,859
actually gets it and stays out of trouble? Thanks, Chris. See you later. Eating the chalk?

141
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:28,890
What are you doing? Whose footprints are these? Chris. Didn't see you there. Hey.

142
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:47,900
You didn't see anything just now, did you? Huh. You can't even say. Chris.

143
00:23:47,900 --> 00:24:03,079
I can't get in there. I have to go around my pop filter. Let me tell you a secret. Oh!

144
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:13,190
Quiet people piss me off. Just because you don't say anything,

145
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:19,029
I can't tell exactly what you're thinking. It's over! I caught five-ee-five-ee eating all the

146
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:24,650
chalk. This was her last chance. Now she'll finally be expelled.

147
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:33,559
Come on, Chris. Don't act shocked. You know it's true. Everyone's waiting for it. Everyone wants

148
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,680
to see this happen. Why am I pulling these back? Why? So, congrats, Chris. You got me.

149
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:47,180
I'm done for. Let me say, one little thing seems like a waste to get expelled just for having

150
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:54,519
a snack. So, Chris, if I know you're going to pull the trigger, I'm going to just get

151
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:12,500
expelled with some real carnage. Chris, how do you feel about losing your face? Chris,

152
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,599
you got a good mother. It would be a shame to make her bury her child. What the

153
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:21,299
fuck is happening? All right, let's get this over with. We'll get more chalk,

154
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,859
mosey back to class, and then, Chris, you'll do our project. How's that sound?

155
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:31,700
What happened? What? Don't bother answering. If you haven't gotten it by now,

156
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:44,099
your choices don't matter. Let's go, freak. At least you're honest. The locker is covered in

157
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:52,819
Jockington Memorabilia. Locked. Locked. Locker's lock is locked. The lock's locker is

158
00:25:52,819 --> 00:26:04,660
locked. The lockers lock's locker is locked. All right, are you ready for the Sadie Hawkins

159
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:13,460
Hawkman's Sadie Hawkman's dance? At this dance, all chaperones will wear giant hawkheads

160
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:23,579
and screech at any students that make contact. God, can you walk any slower or what?

161
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:28,250
Nah, I get it. Not used to walking around without someone holding your hand.

162
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:40,410
Come on, freak. This is like bad. Well, here's the closet. Too bad. We were just

163
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:50,950
starting to have fun. What the hell is happening? Hey, Chris, is it me or

164
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:58,839
is it really dark in there? Hold up, Chris. Are you going to go in or what?

165
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:11,750
Come on, if you're going to be a wimp, then I'll. We'll both go in at the same time.

166
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,930
See, why are you so scared? There's nothing in here but old papers.

167
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:24,089
Let's try to find a light switch. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

168
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,720
That's weird. I can't find a switch. This is further in.

169
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:37,430
Uh, kind of big for a closet, huh? You think we'd have reached the end by now?

170
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:45,099
Is this a surprise birthday party? Hey, Chris, I think this closet's broken.

171
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,559
There aren't any walls. Well, we've worked hard enough.

172
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,880
If Alfie wants chalk so bad, she can get it herself. Let's split.

173
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:13,779
What the? Hey, this isn't funny. Let us out. Let us. Here he comes.

174
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:32,039
The floor, it's. Did I not play Undertale? I play. Yeah, I played through Undertale like

175
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:51,799
fucking five times. Wait, what happened? Am I a different, am I the same character?

176
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:58,730
At times you see it flickering, the light only you can see.

177
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:04,140
By second nature, you reach out and save the game. I made this.

178
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:20,230
I found the run button. Yeah, I did. Cool. You're not going to move? Yes, you are.

179
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:31,160
It's really interesting tidbit about this game. Toby made the whole thing in Game Boy camera,

180
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:43,980
which is like just, I don't even know how you did that. It's too dark to see anything.

181
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,890
I thought you, I mean, I, I, I mean, I did. You thought I made, yeah, well, I mean,

182
00:29:53,289 --> 00:30:03,990
I saw a figure. A blob that seems to be able to move. It's too dark to see anything.

183
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,190
One of these is going to have some kind of item in it, right? Has to. It's too

184
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:18,789
dark to see anything. All right, that's creepy. Right? Like, come on. This is weird.

185
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:29,819
It's too dark to see anything. Let's go down. Uh, item. There's something glowing inside.

186
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:39,059
Take it. Yes. You got the glow shard. Can I see what it is? No, don't toss it.

187
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:45,980
I have a cell phone. Glow shard. A shimmering shard. Its use is unknown.

188
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:59,140
Equip wood blade. Nothing, nothing. No weapons. Power. Level one human.

189
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:14,119
Body contains a human soul. Spells. Guts. Magic defense. Config file. I think this is

190
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:22,059
full on full screen. Hold on a second here. All right. That's pretty good, actually,

191
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:28,150
because now I can do this. I was running into a window this whole time because there's no way

192
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:41,529
to. Oh, is this going to work? There we go. That looks so much better. Cool. Nice. All

193
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:46,650
right. So now we are actually in full screen. You press alt enter. I didn't really think about

194
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:53,099
it. All right, let's go. That's, that's a lot better. Now I can actually see everything.

195
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,619
All right, so there's a figure going this way. We're going to go this way.

196
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:11,140
That one's red. It's going to shoot a laser beam. Yep. Come on. I've got Platinum

197
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,779
God and Binding of Isaac. You really think I'm going to get hit by that?

198
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,269
What are you talking about? You bathe your body in the light. Power shines within you,

199
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:24,859
breaking through the darkness. Any pain you may have had melted away. HP fully restored.

200
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:32,809
And a safe one. In this land, only eyes blinded by darkness can see the way.

201
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:44,390
Okay. So we've got, uh, that's the two. And hold on. We got to, they all have to be dark.

202
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:52,039
So that's it. Eyes blind. Darkness is the way, right?

203
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:03,589
2000 hours in Binding of Isaac. I've stepped on the cubes that you need to step on to open the

204
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:19,670
door in a certain order. Come here. Come on, man. Should I talk to these guys? Oh, they just

205
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,940
explode. I'm really, I'm actually pretty good at this because I mean, I like, I have about

206
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,299
two, 3000 hours in Binding of Isaac. And when you, I always check all the poops for coins

207
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:40,250
and everything. You know what I mean? So, Hey, back off. Come any closer and I'll Chris.

208
00:33:40,329 --> 00:33:45,849
Phew. Hey, don't scare me like that. Dumb ass. Unless you want to get clocked in the face.

209
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:50,490
Anyway, enough screwing around. We got to find a way out of here.

210
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:58,980
Uh, where is here? Anyway, it doesn't matter. You got us into this mess. You get us out of

211
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:06,859
here. Lead the way, Chris. Are there party members? This is fairly new and that fairly,

212
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:11,340
I mean, it is new because I'm like, God, nevermind. You walk way too slow. I was just

213
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:21,420
sprinting. What? I was just going as fast as I could warm up. Okay.

214
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:29,530
Hey Chris, there's someone up there waving at us. Any idea what they want?

215
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:43,559
Here he is. He's going to be here. I can't believe it. Run. Talking about a guy. Oh,

216
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:50,659
wow. Like mega Satan, huh? I have plenty of training. I beat mega Satan with fucking

217
00:34:50,739 --> 00:35:16,500
lost. I didn't get hit one time. Down here quick. I didn't even know what it wanted me to do.

218
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:41,030
I didn't even get to see the tutorial. All right. If I can hit one fucking time,

219
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:51,539
I'm going to go in the dryer and have somebody turn it on. Oh my God. He's so weird.

220
00:35:52,179 --> 00:36:00,860
I wonder if there's any in that building up there. Weird flex. What?

221
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,820
Let me check and open these doors. It looks like a shop, but the door's locked

222
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:24,739
and no one's inside. I'm so weird and quirky. It's locked. I hate that word. That word is

223
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:37,960
worse than mayonnaise. In front of you. Yeah. Castle looms beneath the empty town. A black

224
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,519
geyser emerges from it, piercing endlessly into the sky. Power of this place shines within you.

225
00:36:45,320 --> 00:37:00,889
Yeah, I'll say, but I guess we're going straight in a castle. Why the hell is there

226
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:09,820
a castle inside a supply closet? Welcome. Do not be alarmed. I am not your enemy.

227
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:21,639
Please come forward. Both of you at the same time. Welcome. I am the Prince of this kingdom,

228
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:28,940
the kingdom of darkness. Chris Susie. Oh, sorry. Five oh five. There's a legend in this land,

229
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:34,699
a legend that Monday two heroes of light will arrive and fulfill the ancient prophecy foretold

230
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:47,860
by time and space. Please hear us. Listen to my tale. Very well. Once upon a time,

231
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:56,579
a legend was whispered among shadows. It was a legend of hope. It was a legend of dreams.

232
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:10,619
It was a legend of light and darkness. This is the legend of Delta Rune. For millennia,

233
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:19,289
light and dark have lived in balance, bringing peace to the world. But if this

234
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:25,829
harmony were to shatter, a terrible calamity would occur on this world.

235
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:34,219
The sky will run black with the terror and the land will crack with fear.

236
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:47,989
Then, a heart pounding, the earth will draw her final breath. Only then shining with hope,

237
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:58,010
three heroes appear at world's edge. Sans, Papyrus, and you, a human, a monster,

238
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:09,079
and a prince from the dark, me, Sans. Only they can see of the fountains. Thank you for

239
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,239
playing the Delta Rune demo and banish the angels' heaven. Only then will balance be

240
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:28,300
restored and the world saved from destruction. Today, the fountain of darkness, the geyser that

241
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:39,449
gives this land form, stands tall at the center of the kingdom. But recently, another

242
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:46,409
fountain has appeared on the horizon. It's over there. And with it, the balance of light and

243
00:39:46,409 --> 00:40:02,039
dark begins to shift. So, Chris, five of us, thank you for listening to my long tale.

244
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,340
I deeply believe you two are the heroes of the legend. That despite whatever

245
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:12,730
enemies you may face, you two have the courage to save the world. Delta warriors,

246
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:22,730
please, won't you accept your destiny? Uh, no. Wait, what? Me, some kind of hero or something?

247
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:29,929
No way, not me. You've got the wrong person. But, but, but, without you, the world is...

248
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:33,849
So what, if the world is destroyed, I don't care. It's none of my damn business.

249
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:41,940
Might even be kind of fun. Anyway, Chris, if you want to play pretend with this weirdo,

250
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:47,099
stick around. I'm going to find a way out of here. Oh, no, five will find me, wait.

251
00:40:55,909 --> 00:41:02,679
Oh, wait. The heroes are already running away. And they didn't even know I was here. My dad's

252
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:12,860
gonna make me son of the month. Who the hell are you? I'm the bad guy. You clowns want

253
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,059
to seal our dark fountain, huh? I'm still picturing you guys as clowns. Save the world

254
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:25,030
from eternal darkness, huh? Hey, don't try and deny it. We both know you'll go east.

255
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:32,869
It's your only way home. But I, Lancer, won't let you go there. And I've got a flawless two-step

256
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:42,300
plan to ensure it. Step one, I thrash you. Step two, you lose. Nice playing, kid. Really?

257
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:54,119
Actually, it's a pretty good plan. Mind if we use it on you instead? Actual full-on RPG.

258
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:13,619
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. What was that? Interesting. Okay. So you

259
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:23,690
have to time, it's time hits. Okay, cool. And then when you, all right, this is cool.

260
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:33,800
This is like just, that's really, that's actually pretty cool. I'm gonna do it. Check.

261
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,880
Warning. You tell Lancer to watch out for Suzy's attack. He readies himself.

262
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:49,289
So what are you guys gonna do? What are you guys doing after this? Lancer's motorcycle is

263
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:58,090
actually just a bike that's on fire. That was a compliment. You tell Lancer you can't

264
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,250
tell the difference between his clothes and his body. He seems flattered. His attack power

265
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:12,570
went down. Oh, you make my feelings do wheelies. Sweet wheelies. Oh, I'm getting hit.

266
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait a second. My bike's running out of fuel. All right, you

267
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,690
punkaroos. You had the luck of the draw this time. Next time the losers will be you.

268
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:28,409
What does that say? I don't know what that means. Bye losers. I gotta get home before dinner.

269
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:42,789
39 D money. Oh, it's a dryer run. Oh shit. I gotta go in there. Are you two okay?

270
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:53,059
Um, allow me to introduce myself more properly. I am. Take off the hood.

271
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:58,039
I can barely hear you. Oh, all right.

272
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,079
Well, I don't even like, I didn't even, I don't care if Sans is in the game.

273
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:21,269
I don't give a shit. Why am I pretending to care about that? I got like, I pretended to care

274
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:26,869
about it like an hour ago. And me, I like believed my own pretending. I was actually

275
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:33,130
waiting for it. Hello everyone. I'm Rousey. Chris, Susie, it's ever so wonderful to meet

276
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,090
you. I'm certain we're going to become great friends and this way to leave is east, right?

277
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:51,050
Yes, that's where I wheel. Got it. See you at school, Chris. Um, I suppose it's just the two of

278
00:44:51,050 --> 00:45:01,239
us then. Chris, I'm a prince, but I currently don't have any subjects. I've been waiting

279
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:06,440
alone here my whole life for you two to arrive. So I'm really happy to meet you.

280
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,940
Hope we can be good friends, Chris. Let's try to find Susie. She must be to the southeast.

281
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:25,820
You can lead the way, Chris. Hey Chris, I really think we should go catch up with Susie. We can

282
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:31,159
come back here after our adventure is over and then I can bake you a yummy cake. Hey, thanks.

283
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:43,139
Rousey the lonely prince is now your ally. Our fluffy boys shines within you.

284
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,679
Oh, Chris, it's the training dummy I made. Now seems like a great chance to prepare for

285
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:05,800
the enemy. Would you like me to teach you how to fight? Yeah, I just, I want to know. I know

286
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,960
how to do it, but I just want to be told because I want to know what the deal is. See that heart

287
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,239
there, Chris? Yep. That's your soul, the combination of your being within it holds your

288
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,880
well, your compassion and the fate of the world. If it gets hit, you and your friends

289
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,599
will die. If everyone's HP reaches zero, then Jerma has to get into a dryer and we'll lose.

290
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,199
So please take care not to get hit. Don't get hit by the enemy stacks. Ready? Let's try

291
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:41,980
dodging. What? Natural. Anyhow, after the enemy attacks, it's our turn, Chris. First,

292
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:47,099
I'll teach you how to fight. The fighting is unnecessary in this world. There's no harm in a

293
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:53,030
thorough lesson. Is there anything I can do besides this? Right, that's it, right?

294
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,670
Wow, Chris, that was an amazing attack. Have you done this before or something?

295
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,059
Okay, now let's try defending. Simply defend and the enemy's attack will hurt you less.

296
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:08,820
Not only that, but you'll also gather TP. Watch the orange big bar on the left and we'll explain

297
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:17,989
it next. Great, now that we've gathered TP, how about spending that TP on one of my spells?

298
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:25,690
Because you hit the enemy enough, it got tired. Stop, I used my pacify spell on it.

299
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:36,980
It'll fall asleep and we'll win peacefully. Magic pacify on the tired dummy. Great,

300
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,260
you could have won the battle by now. Now I have just a little more to teach you.

301
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,219
Acting through this, even though the even the most violent enemies can be defeated through

302
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:51,800
various acts of kindness. Chris, though, is just a dummy. Why not give it a hug?

303
00:47:52,599 --> 00:48:02,019
You know, I can hug the prince. Oh, that's great, Chris. Each enemy has different acts

304
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:07,139
that satisfy them. When an enemy is satisfied, its name turns yellow. When that happens, you

305
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:11,929
can defeat it by sparing it. If we spare all the enemies we meet, we'll never have to fight.

306
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:29,659
So is it yellow? Not quite. You can hug Rousey. Chris, I don't think this is what you're supposed

307
00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:40,940
to be doing. Hug. Hug the dummy. That's great, Chris. Just one hug is enough, though.

308
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:51,050
Oh, I don't know how to do anything else. So that is yellow. Great job. That'd be the end

309
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,829
of the real battle. I'm really happy I had the chance to teach you, Chris. That's zero

310
00:48:55,829 --> 00:49:04,550
xp in two delays. That was fun. You're a wonderful student, Chris. And in case you ever need a

311
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:09,829
refresher eye, here I wrote a manual for you. You see, open the menu, use it on your items.

312
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:27,130
It's just a dummy. What a JoJo reference? What does that mean? Oh my, the great door is open!

313
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:32,900
No wonder Lancer was able to come through. Chris, once we pass through this door, our

314
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,780
adventure will really begin. A journey foretold exactly by the prophecy, but Chris, I believe

315
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,059
your choices are important, too. This world is full of all kinds of people, Chris. In the end,

316
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:49,059
how we treat them makes all the difference. So let's try our best to kill everyone, every

317
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:54,420
person you come across, and get the bad ending. If we can manage to do that, then chat will

318
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,380
be very upset, and I believe this tale may have a very bad ending and a lot of unsubscriptions

319
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:06,659
to your channel. Otherwise, I fear that you may get the good ending and people will be happy.

320
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:17,739
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that too much? I knew you were here the moment I saw it. Let's try our best.

321
00:50:18,539 --> 00:50:30,699
Thank you for playing! The Mario demo screen is going to turn off, the thing that used to be

322
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:40,659
in GameStop. Now I gotta let the person behind me play. Reset the Super Nintendo on me.

323
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:50,090
With the door closed behind you, your adventure will truly begin. Our adventure

324
00:50:50,090 --> 00:51:01,420
shines within you. 46 minutes. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let's take the scenery in first. I mean,

325
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:07,690
why am I rushing through this? This demo is only like three hours long. I might as well

326
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:22,409
just look at everything. The field of hopes and dreams. Enemies ahead, you're gonna die.

327
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:23,449
Signed Lancer.

328
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:51,059
Okay, Rudin Drewneer. He won. I didn't have an option. Did I just kill him?

329
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:55,340
I didn't have an option. I didn't kill him. I scared him.

330
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,159
Bad ending. If you're reading this, I guess you're dead. Signed Lancer.

331
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:12,500
I didn't act. I will... I... Get away from me with the sword! Don't come up to me with the sword.

332
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:25,559
Idiot. Hey, don't read the sign. It's a work in progress. Signed Lancer.

333
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,900
Ho ho ho, but isn't my two favorite people. Sike, you guys aren't even in my top five.

334
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,699
Lancer, where's Susie? You mean that purple girl? Ho ho ho, you fools! You're too late to

335
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:49,860
stop me. What did you do? It was so simple. She beat me up, so I ran away.

336
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:57,929
Hence a bit anti-climactic. Am I dead? Sorry, you're just going to stand there.

337
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:12,679
Thought you would at least run to the right. Why? The purple girl's over there. Well,

338
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:20,099
all right. Put him up down. These types of trees don't contain an item that can heal you.

339
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,219
Whatever you do, don't check the tree and use C to open your menu. Got it? Signed Lancer.

340
00:53:26,099 --> 00:53:35,880
There are two objects hanging from the tree. Take one. You got the dark candy. What about

341
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:43,079
the other one? Take, yeah. You got the, this, okay, this is two. There's nothing hanging low

342
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:53,699
enough to take. All right, see you later, weirdo. Hey, if you head that way, my troops will

343
00:53:53,699 --> 00:54:04,440
trash you. Is that a threat? I prefer to think of it as an invitation. All right, I'm gonna

344
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:12,039
be, I'm gonna be nice. A necklace of Rudens blocks your path. All right, Ruden up top. Let's see,

345
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:22,360
check. Let's, let's lecture. A necklace of Rudens blocks your path. I can only act with, um,

346
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:29,269
Chris. You lecture the enemies on the importance of kindness. The enemies became tired.

347
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,789
What? Okay, long live the guy who pays us.

348
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:47,670
Yes, long live the guy who pays us. Ruden is starting to fall asleep. Can I, they're not yellow yet.

349
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:57,429
Convince. You told Ruden to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed. Yeah, I guess it makes sense.

350
00:54:57,429 --> 00:55:05,820
Face my diamond cutter. Hitbox is fairly large, but I guess that's the, all right, spare.

351
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,920
Ruden is starting to fall asleep. Let's, uh, spare. I can only spare the top one. Chris,

352
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:21,019
spared Ruden. Name wasn't yellow. Face my diamond cutter so you can pacify.

353
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:32,809
Does pacify just make them more susceptible to, ow. Not yet. All right, let's convince.

354
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:55,030
Pacify just ends the fight. Wait, did I just hit him? I think I hit him. Good. He missed.

355
00:55:55,030 --> 00:56:03,019
All right, starting to fall asleep. There you go. I get, the only thing that's confusing me

356
00:56:03,019 --> 00:56:07,099
is from the first game just having the one menu and having more than one party member is

357
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:21,260
trying to get used to that. See, I spared them. They're fine. I thought that was him.

358
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:31,769
Damn. But thank you, uh, thank you Alpine's B for the hundred dollars.

359
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:38,539
A hundred bucks from Alpine. Thank you. Hi, Jeremy. I'm donating on behalf of my friend

360
00:56:38,539 --> 00:56:45,340
Michael who passed away recently. We've been following since the TF2 days and you've given

361
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,820
us so much joy. Thank you for everything. Alpine, I'm very sorry to hear about that.

362
00:56:54,170 --> 00:57:01,769
Thank you so much for the hundred bucks. You too have been apparently following since, well,

363
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:13,019
all the way back then. I'm really sorry to hear about that. Hopefully you give yourself

364
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:22,469
the time necessary to grieve and and much love and much respect to obviously Michael's

365
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:31,820
family as well. So take care of yourself and thanks for, uh, thanks for being around.

366
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:48,440
Nothing can take away the memories that you two have. That's true.

367
00:57:49,400 --> 00:58:08,869
That is very true. Why is everyone's messages getting deleted? They shouldn't be.

368
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:22,659
Let's go here. Uh, I'm Top Chef. My latest cake worked me to exhaustion. Top Chef.

369
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:29,619
Message deleted. What's going on? Oh, now you guys are just joking with me here.

370
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,059
Mama Miba, I'm Top Chef. My latest cake worked me to exhaustion.

371
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:46,139
So I took a little nap, but Mama Miba, a scary noise woke me up. The beast was

372
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:50,940
hunched on the table, eating the cake like an animal. I spritzed it with water and

373
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:56,619
hissed and ran off. But my wonderful cake is... Oh Chris, that sounds like Susie. We must be

374
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:08,920
going the right way. Let's try to keep her out of any more trouble. I got, hold on,

375
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:18,250
this is important. I got something else to say. Um, I just want to make this, uh, very

376
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:27,659
clear that anytime I hear about something like this, right? Uh, I'm, I'm so just,

377
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,760
if you have this channel and you and your friends and or you and your family members or

378
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,360
whatever and you guys hang out here and you like this shit and you hang and it's like,

379
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:53,219
it means a lot to you. It means a lot to me. So just knowing that people have fun here

380
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:59,769
and we're, I think about it a lot. So just want to make sure you guys are very clear on

381
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:19,559
that. Thanks a lot. All right, let's go back into it. Uh, here's the cake. Why is the cake

382
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:30,539
like a flying saucer? Take a piece of cake. Yeah, sure. The broken cake was added to your

383
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:47,269
key items. Is that bad? Should I not be doing that? What if I talk to him again with the,

384
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:53,800
can I give him the piece of cake? Mama meba mama mama sheba. You know that beast,

385
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:06,780
please don't come back. All right. No, no, no. No Hathi blocked the way.

386
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:19,210
All right. Rudin needs to be lectured and how much magic I don't have any magic. So

387
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:31,369
defend first. The enemies became tired. What? Okay. What is that? Why is it just like a

388
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:47,030
Wii U drawing? Oh shit. Okay. Hathi's beat slows. Not yet. Now let's convince and then pacify

389
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:53,800
on Hathi. You told Rudin to quit fighting. It was utterly swayed. Rousy cast pacify.

390
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:06,150
I guess that makes sense. Uh, pardon us. Uh, fall asleep. You don't do anything.

391
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:15,860
Oh, we just had a bunch of community subs. Novi gave five community subs. Thanks a lot.

392
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:22,940
Thank you so much Novi and congratulations to the people that are getting these community subs.

393
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:32,739
Thank you. Puzzle time. We got a puzzle here. Check it out. Check the clock. In order to

394
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:45,980
solve this puzzle, you'll have to hurry. They've got so much time in The Legend of

395
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:59,139
Zelda. I beat Star Tropic's first try blind without taking any damage. Behold the maze of

396
01:02:59,139 --> 01:03:13,130
death. Prepare to get lost clowns. Signed, Lancer. Uh-oh. Failing lost yet? You must be utterly helpless

397
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:18,730
among these twists and turns. Your sense of direction will save you now. What's that?

398
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:25,929
It's some sort of enemy. Looks like they got clobbered. Oh, I see. Well, I'm assuming

399
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:30,139
I have to follow the signs, but I kind of want to see what's over here. Well, wait a

400
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,460
minute. Even if you're my enemy, I've got to warn you. A purple beast is roaming clobbering

401
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:40,940
anyone who dares block her way. We don't even like fighting. The king left us no choice.

402
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:51,260
Oh, Chris, we need to stop Susie quick. Hey, wait, where am I? Help. Somebody help me. I'm lost.

403
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:57,300
Oh, and there are coins. You open the treasure chest. Inside was a white

404
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,539
ribbon. You put white ribbon in your armor. That ribbon is armor, Chris.

405
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:07,059
It increases defense. Why don't you try wearing it in the equipment menu? Yeah, I will. I think

406
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:16,699
it'd look great on you. Okay, so this is Chris. And we got white ribbon is

407
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:23,639
crinkly hair ribbon that slightly increases your defense and cuteness. What the fuck does

408
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:46,300
that mean? I've higher cuteness. Oh, no. Well, Rousey apparently is cuter now. Chris,

409
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:58,570
you're giving it to me? Well, does it look pretty? I better get that back. That's a loan,

410
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:07,690
man. I want three ribbons back with interest. Hey, don't look. This sign's private. I already did.

411
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:17,690
Oh, it's just this way. There is. Oh, somehow you survived the babies, but don't count on

412
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:24,920
your blessings before they hatch. Let's see if you're against this team. My triple frogs.

413
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:35,349
Three Hatties blocked the way. So we can go to act. Let's do flatter. Let's flatter.

414
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:41,929
And let's get some defense here. You told the Hattie it has cool tentacles. It began to think

415
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:49,530
about this. That was that one up top is. Is that like a Grinch meter? I don't understand

416
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:52,809
the Grinch meter. Hey, why aren't you guys thrashed? You're totally outnumbered.

417
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,090
You made a team purely of support enemies. Their bullet patterns aren't balanced at all.

418
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:04,730
It's like a dinner made out of three glasses of milk. And that's how unusual somehow.

419
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:14,789
Why don't we talk about this after the battle? Okay. Let me pacify.

420
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:24,760
Pacify, but the enemy wasn't tired. Okay. Well, one of the middle's angry,

421
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:37,829
but it doesn't matter. These things until I figure it out. Flatter. And began to think

422
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:52,250
about this. Now it's very happy that I said that. Hattie's body beats audibly.

423
01:06:53,699 --> 01:07:00,170
X-flatter. You order Raazi to flatter all the enemies. Oh, you can do... I get it. You don't need

424
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:07,369
experience just encountering your smile is rewarding enough. Why does somebody just say...

425
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:22,179
All right, spare them both. There, spare, spare. Great job, Hurst. We earned zero XP and $88.

426
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:30,329
Sweet! How much do I get? You lost. You don't get anything. Oh, can I have some of yours?

427
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:46,329
No. Fine. Later, losers. I'm still just standing here. Sup? I thought you were running away.

428
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:47,929
Yeah, I finished.

429
01:07:51,820 --> 01:08:03,639
All right, that's... That's fine. That was funny. Come on, that was cute. My cuteness

430
01:08:03,639 --> 01:08:41,619
was up, but that's why. No, get over that. That's scripted. That's scripted, guys. Excuse me.

431
01:08:41,619 --> 01:08:47,529
That's scripted. He can't solve it. I physically can't solve it.

432
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Come on, man. Open your door, you stupid door. Oh, great. It's you guys. Susie, we were ever so

433
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:04,520
worried about you. How'd you get past those spikes before? Walk through them. But this door

434
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:10,840
sucks. Oh, don't worry, Susie. A little bit after we solved the puzzle over there. Nice.

435
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:17,479
Tell me when you finish it. Susie, we need you to finish it. Sometimes proceeding

436
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:21,479
will take all three of us. Furthermore, only Chris can seal the dark fountain.

437
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:26,899
So if you don't accompany us, you won't make it home. So you're saying I have to stick with you,

438
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:37,880
Rune? Yep. Let's just get this over with. Yahoo! Susie's... Yeah!

439
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:58,359
Susie's back on the team. Cue the fanfare. Susie joined the party. That was long. Susie

440
01:09:59,079 --> 01:10:15,590
follows at a distance such that no one can tell she's associated. Not anymore.

441
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:32,979
All right, here we go. Three, two, one, action! Action! Did it! Step on it!

442
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:49,180
Hey, Chris, if you need help with the puzzle, feel free to ask me. No. And if you need help

443
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:55,479
from me, you're screwed. Just wait. Let me... how... it's got to be like this.

444
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:40,630
Yeah! I can't do it. I'm just gonna scream Yahoo! But I would have like peaked the microphone so

445
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:48,409
loudly. Let's go, dog! Oh, Chris just realized Susie missed the tutorial.

446
01:11:49,369 --> 01:12:01,829
Next battle, we should show her how to act. I think she might really enjoy that. C-Round

447
01:12:01,829 --> 01:12:09,609
attacked violently. You recall Rousey's advice to include Susie in an act. Okay, act. No, no,

448
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:18,619
don't hurt. C-Round. Compliment. You recall, uh, Rousey, you're just going to defend.

449
01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:25,590
You ordered Susie to flatter the enemy. What? Why the hell would I do that? It attacked us!

450
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:31,590
Let's smash it before it moves! Oh, look, Susie, it seems harmless. If you act nice,

451
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:38,550
we might win without hurting it. Okay, hey, little guy, I really like the axe on your face.

452
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:57,020
Oh, am I gonna get the bad ending because of that? The bad ending. Hehehe, I sneaked

453
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:16,890
by and made a sign. Weirdo. Wow, look at that guy over there. Susie, listen. As heroes,

454
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:22,409
we have the power to make a peaceful future. So, from now on, let's try avoiding fighting.

455
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:29,579
Uh, what if you just took it easy on me? If you weaken an enemy, I can use my pacify spell,

456
01:13:29,579 --> 01:13:34,409
which can put exhausted people to sleep. Yawn, yeah, you talking is already doing that.

457
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,810
Well, um, just think about it. You might have to warn enemies about her.

458
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,720
The violent tormentor is now your ally. The power of mean girls shines within you.

459
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:18,810
Hey. Hey, kid. You wanna buy a tutorial? It's only 50 dark dollars. Really? You're

460
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:31,779
really gonna buy it? Right this way, gentlemen. Uh, we're sorry, we're normally puzzle guys, but

461
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,579
we've been forced to do tutorials just to make ends meet. When the king got power,

462
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:40,979
he fired everyone and replaced all puzzle makers with him. Rooks will scar the lord of the

463
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:49,670
puzzles. Be careful. I'm TP master. Ask me about TP. Secret. TP only lasts inside a fight.

464
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:55,619
Once you win, it's out of sight. Having extra feels unbearable. No point in saving. It's

465
01:14:55,619 --> 01:15:00,500
straight up terrible. The leftover TP turns into extra money at the end of a battle.

466
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:14,420
You mean I only should have been using one square? I'm Ralsei master. Ask me about Ralsei's

467
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:22,899
fact. Ralsei loves when you give us money. He will hug you and call you honey. Hey,

468
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:28,979
that's not true. You don't need money to get me to do that. I'm Susie master. Ask me anything

469
01:15:28,979 --> 01:15:36,140
about Susie. Uh, fact. Susie loves when you give us money. She will. Nope, don't care.

470
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:44,859
Did I say something funny? I don't have any hats. I'm Chris master. Ask me anything about

471
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:50,859
Chris. Fact. It's a good idea to give us bucks. It'll make you happy and fill you

472
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:55,819
with lucks. Over there is our donation hole. We had a box, but it got stole.

473
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:08,550
Hole goals. $1 monthly tutorial weekly. $10 weekly tutorial monthly. $100 stop making tutorials.

474
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:17,140
Donation hole. If you like our tutorials, please throw your money into a hole. You put

475
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:25,930
a dollar in the hole. The hole became full. The hole is filled to the brim with cash.

476
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:32,250
I put a dollar in. The king didn't even give us severance pay. His son just gave us all

477
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:40,100
beanies. Itchy beanies. That was a fake. That was just a large cartoon dollar.

478
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:48,119
You guys know fun fact. That's not even true. Never mind. It's a lie.

479
01:16:54,359 --> 01:17:05,979
Never mind. Hihi, welcome travelers. Whatever you got. A star shaped candy that heals 40 HP.

480
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:14,619
Mysterious hamburger heals 70 HP. Defensive charm that a spooky sword.

481
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:28,920
I feel like this is probably important. Do I have 200 bucks? I already have two candies.

482
01:17:30,199 --> 01:17:37,619
You get a burger. That's a lot of money though. $70 for a hamburger? That's kind of insane.

483
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:54,260
Burger. I'm gonna buy one of these cards too. What about yourself? The name's Sheem, pronounced

484
01:17:54,260 --> 01:18:02,420
Sean. And this is my little sheep. It's haha. Over the years I've collected odds and ends.

485
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,859
Of course I have no attachment to any of it. It's just a hobby of mine.

486
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:10,500
Around here you learn to find ways to pass the time or go mad like everyone else.

487
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:21,720
Long ago the darkners lived in harmony with the lightners. They were like gods to us. Our

488
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,380
protectors, our creators, those who gave us purpose. And one day we were all locked away in

489
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:34,140
this prison and the lightners never returned. Embittered, the king took up arms and aims to

490
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:39,340
take revenge upon the lightners that left us behind. Of course even among his troops

491
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:47,739
some still distantly hope the lightners will return. You're legendary, ha ha ha. So you

492
01:18:47,739 --> 01:18:52,060
are the heroes who are going to seal our fountain. Ha good luck, it makes no difference

493
01:18:52,060 --> 01:19:01,720
to me. Neither light nor dark hold a future for a dark nerd in my condition. Historically this land

494
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,600
was ruled by the four kings from Card Castle to the east but recently a strange knight

495
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,359
appeared and three of the kings were locked away. The remaining king put him and his strange son

496
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:19,479
into power. This land has seen this much chaos since. Laughing about it just a little

497
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:36,170
bit. Well you don't need to know about that. Let's give it a save. Power of mean girls.

498
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:50,060
Chaos chaos chaos. What do you mean chaos? We're sorry we're normally puzzle guys but yeah

499
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:59,140
just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Gaining TP. You get TP when you defend

500
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:03,859
then you can cast spells. Yeah that's what I figured. Look for the heart outline when you

501
01:20:03,859 --> 01:20:11,819
get close to bullets. Oh wait hold on because it's important. So when you barely get hit by

502
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:19,779
something it gives you defense points. Say that again. You get TP when you defend protect yourself

503
01:20:19,779 --> 01:20:24,100
and cast spells. You also get TP by getting close to bullets. Look for the heart outline.

504
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:41,510
Okay so I wasn't getting actually I wasn't getting hit by anything. Okay okay so as long

505
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:51,930
as I get close enough from the door. It's a lone door frame but for some reason you can't

506
01:20:51,930 --> 01:21:05,750
see through it. Well flip my flapjacks. The clowns are back in town. Well bad news since you last

507
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:10,310
saw me several minutes ago. I've created a brand new fighting team ready to stop me.

508
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:14,310
Not even the purple girl can stop me now. Oh what are you ready for me?

509
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:23,189
Stop talking. Ho ho ho. What is that? Why are you saying that? Ho ho ho. It's my evil laugh.

510
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:29,859
Scary right? Sound like baby santa claus. Oh you mean like in a badass way?

511
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:41,029
Shut up. Really think you know how to be scary? Well I uh wrong.

512
01:21:42,069 --> 01:21:47,659
Maybe tough guys like you really piss me off. They said you wouldn't know scary.

513
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:53,050
They picked you up and bit your face off. Why why does she want to eat people? That's not

514
01:21:53,050 --> 01:22:04,260
true. Really? Then why don't you prove it? Eat this person? Well start with the part

515
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:17,239
where your face gets bit off. Oh okay I get it. Thank you purple girl. What?

516
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:22,140
Thanks it was kind of you to teach me how to be scary with an evil laugh.

517
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:37,529
Hey I wasn't and now you're going to be thrashed. Ah ah Merry Christmas.

518
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:56,180
I guess that's kind of an improvement. A board of jigsaws walked away. I'm gonna

519
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:05,180
probably warn. Warn the jigsaw? You and Rousey warned the enemies about Susie. Everyone went

520
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:17,819
on guard. Fighting? I love fighting. I have a rent payment to make. How? Trying to calculate

521
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:28,380
this month's rent. So they've been warned. Now let's be friends. I'm gonna just defend here.

522
01:23:29,859 --> 01:23:37,939
Barely lift the finger and well look we have to be friends. Good. I always want to be friends

523
01:23:37,939 --> 01:23:47,720
just like you. We're friends now. I do want to get barely hit. Uh jigsaw is pretending to

524
01:23:47,720 --> 01:24:05,109
march. They're all good to go. Oh wait uh oh uh oh uh oh uh oh thank god. We're friends

525
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:23,659
now. Voila. Jigsaw is wishing it could quit its job. Double spare. You won. You got 73 dollars.

526
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:35,380
All right now where's Papyrus 2? Oh no not one of these. Oh look Chris another puzzle.

527
01:24:36,819 --> 01:24:43,770
Oh no. Let's read the instructions. Oh the instructions are vandalized. It says

528
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:50,569
thou fools thou will never figure out how to do it. Now ruining instructions does

529
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:58,489
definitely against the rules. Then it says ps I make my own rules. RK. Well that explains that.

530
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:06,260
Why don't we just climb over this spiked fence? Not because then we'd get impaled and die.

531
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:14,729
Cool I'll work on that and you do the puzzle. Try your best. Why can't you just stand over

532
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:27,960
there? Great job Chris. I think you're on to something. I know I'm on to something.

533
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,600
Give up whenever you feel like it. So I'll go what's with this angel and devil bullshit?

534
01:25:38,729 --> 01:25:48,180
You did it Chris. Great job. Damn didn't get to impale myself. Jesus. Good job Chris.

535
01:25:50,819 --> 01:26:04,039
Galaxy brain. Always check the top. Always check around. From the bottom the order of our rooms

536
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:25,510
in card castle. Of course if you haven't been there you won't know it. Okay uh really emphasizing

537
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:35,180
that it's impossible if you haven't been there. So I have to see where all the rooms are.

538
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:46,699
Is it impossible though? I'm killing this guy. No I'm not. What would Sans do?

539
01:26:47,739 --> 01:27:11,590
Warn the enemies about Susie. Matthew has a little secret. Okay let's. Is it lecture or

540
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:17,260
convince? I just convinced. You told Rudin to quit fighting. He was utterly swayed.

541
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:30,920
Yeah I guess that makes sense. Long live the guy who paid this. Shit. Okay so I can spare

542
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:40,810
Rudin and then. Spare Rudin and then. Are they are they warned right now?

543
01:27:41,609 --> 01:28:00,250
Yeah they're warned. I could always pacify. No one's tired. Just kill them. That defeats.

544
01:28:00,890 --> 01:28:03,609
Look I played the first game and I know that.

545
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:08,970
Spoilers for the first game. Why would you be watching this if you don't know about the

546
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:23,560
first game? Uh if you. Whatever. You know what I'm about to say. Wow Undertale spoilers.

547
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:28,699
Well don't act like you never played it. All right let's do extreme flatter.

548
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:37,539
You don't need XP just encountering your smile is rewarding enough.

549
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:50,699
Now let's my face my diamond cutter. Yeah yeah yeah. All right so spare. Spare.

550
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:57,750
Congratulations you win the game. Wait Undertale's a game? Uh it's an app.

551
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:07,430
That's the proper way to say it. So I mean it's an app man. Uh all right let me.

552
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:16,550
I guess we're just gonna go this way. Sign. When you step into the light you'll return to

553
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:29,220
where you were before. I don't think I want to do that though. All right so we gotta go.

554
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:43,619
We gotta wait till we get an opportunity right now. Okay more of that. More of this.

555
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:55,449
Uh oh. Hon man drew near. All right we got hon man lullaby or let's do warning.

556
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:14,729
Oh I wasn't ready for that one. Hypnotize by your idle animation. All right so we can do uh

557
01:30:14,729 --> 01:30:22,170
let's lullaby. Let's lullaby. Saying a soft and entrancing lullaby. Hon man fell asleep.

558
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:33,989
Suzy fell asleep and we just became tired. Okay well that's good. Can't keep its eyes open

559
01:30:36,579 --> 01:30:47,590
and I can pacify. Now she won't attack. That's good. Though she kind of has low HP.

560
01:30:52,779 --> 01:31:03,579
You kind of got low HP. Now we got another flash here. Back and forth. One two one two one two.

561
01:31:03,579 --> 01:31:16,199
Sure thing. There's Santa. So you've begun to cross the great board.

562
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:27,420
The halfway point to our castle. Impressive. So it's a shame you won't make it a step further

563
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:32,699
because my guys are about to smash you into blood. Lots of blood. Splooshing blood. Very gross and

564
01:31:32,699 --> 01:31:44,520
bad. Hey purple girl was that scarier? You're asking me because you're really cool at being

565
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:56,340
terrifying. I want to be as scary as you. You want to be like me? Yeah. Well that's stupid.

566
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:02,899
But um the new laugh isn't as awful. Saying you'd turn us into blood is uh cool.

567
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:12,170
What's up with the bucket though? It's to put the blood in. Oh yeah I'm not uh not supposed

568
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:18,170
to make a mess. Anyway thanks for your feedback. I'm really feeling scary. No problem I

569
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:27,159
guess. That's that. I write that. That's I do haha. So are you guys gonna attack us or uh oh

570
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:32,119
yeah oh yeah I was so excited I forgot to bring any guys but next time it'll be the end for

571
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:38,359
Hey I've just been calling you guys clowns. Does your team have an official name or something?

572
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,220
Oh Chris we should come up with a name. No we shouldn't.

573
01:32:43,939 --> 01:32:46,340
Then it's decided everyone puts a name in the bucket.

574
01:32:47,619 --> 01:32:56,840
All right everyone's put in their entry. Blue person you can choose since you look like you

575
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:06,170
don't care. Uh crumpled paper neat paper or lancer labeled paper. Definitely this one.

576
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:12,489
You take the paper what lancer have written on the outside. You open it up. On the inside it

577
01:33:12,489 --> 01:33:19,659
also says lancer. Wow who did that one it's really good. Wait why did you get to choose

578
01:33:19,659 --> 01:33:27,100
the name? Yeah he didn't. Chris did. Yeah it doesn't matter who may have written it. Regardless

579
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:30,939
lancer is going to meet absolute doom. This name feels weird actually.

580
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:47,800
I know let's call it the lancer fan club for short. See you later me. The power of the lancer

581
01:33:47,800 --> 01:34:07,689
fan club shines within you. It sure does. Watch out. Oh oh let me watch it. So three two.

582
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:15,560
So it's safe up there. It's safe up in the in the corner there. So just stand here. So

583
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:22,680
then it's safe in the middle. No it's not. It's safe in the. I mean it is. It is now.

584
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:30,420
Oh same. I'm getting like electrocuted. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

585
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:50,039
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. This streamer man. What? You gotta say something. Say it to my

586
01:34:50,039 --> 01:35:00,869
face. If you're gonna say something say it to my face. That's uh doing rounds he warned

587
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:04,390
the enemies about Susie. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Show us your face then.

588
01:35:04,390 --> 01:35:11,640
Uh I gave italics my weapon. I was gonna turn it on.

589
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:19,260
It's not here. Uh vomit listens politely despite having no ears.

590
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:43,159
Now he can act but he's asleep. Susie fell asleep. They're all tired and can't keep

591
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:54,220
his eyes open. Good. You're out. Good. Uh you're out. Nice joker reference.

592
01:36:00,069 --> 01:36:08,260
Stop. I got hit. I shouldn't have gotten hit by that. Pawn man can't keep his eyes open.

593
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:22,539
Let's. I'm gonna put you back to sleep again. See ya. I need to heal uh Susie. Susie's hurt.

594
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:36,810
Why was that thing? Great board two. It's fireman. Look at this dude.

595
01:36:37,609 --> 01:36:45,220
Oh they're horsey. Pawn men are scary but all in all they're doing is following the king.

596
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:52,119
Us on the board used to have our own boss. Those were the peaceful times but now even

597
01:36:52,119 --> 01:36:59,399
the boss has been reduced to the king's peon. My name? Mr. Elegance. Haha and these these are

598
01:36:59,399 --> 01:37:16,090
my nostrils not my eyes. Can still see out of them though. Interesting. Fear not we unlike

599
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:22,170
the simple pawn man possess full faculty over our actions. I Mr. Society am far too intelligent

600
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:29,579
to ever bow down to such a tyrant unless he asks me. He's very scary you see. What? You

601
01:37:29,579 --> 01:37:33,899
think you possess the power to topple that brute? Yes yes yes. I'm sure everyone will

602
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:45,640
support you. Go for it. Just as long as I don't have to participate. Okay thanks. Oh

603
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:51,880
well step on my boots. If it isn't the Lancer fan club you boys or girls had better

604
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:57,239
turn back while you can. Lancer what is it this time? Oh I'm simply warning you.

605
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,659
Something extremely dangerous is lying ahead. Oh it's actually really inconvenient.

606
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:14,180
I can't go home at all because I'm so scared. What is it? We already fought this dog. Hey

607
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:21,670
it's the little guy. That's what you're afraid of. Wow purple girl you aren't scared?

608
01:38:21,670 --> 01:38:41,300
Why would I be? What's it gonna do? Well normally it crushes people to death I think.

609
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:57,460
Here it comes. K-round. Deep bow warning. Let's let's give it let's do a warning.

610
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,979
You explain to K-round about the importance of dodging Suzy's attacks but it didn't seem

611
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:17,529
to understand. Well oh god okay it just jumps. Well let's bow. You and Rousey bowed. K-round

612
01:39:17,529 --> 01:39:22,890
bowed back. Its crown loosened. That's it Chris. If we can get its crown off it should

613
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:29,539
turn back into a little guy. Suzy help us bow at it. Now its crown will come off when I smash

614
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:45,079
the guy to the ground. Well I'm gonna have to put you to sleep. Can I? I don't have like a lullaby

615
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:57,640
because we can do deep bow. The crown is 20% loose. Is there anything I can do to make you?

616
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:07,960
I guess I can. Here I'll do this. I'm gonna bow. Pacify. Can I pacify? I figured maybe I

617
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:27,590
could um pacify Suzy. All right bow and then heal prayer. I can't heal. Heal ally.

618
01:40:29,989 --> 01:40:39,689
Well looks like we're doing the super bow. Bowed back. Its crown loosened.

619
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:50,199
Ah felt stressed out and attacked. K-round practiced self-care. What was that? Was that

620
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:58,170
like almond milk? K-round's HP and attack went up. Suzy stop attacking it you're making

621
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:09,699
it stronger. Let it think I'm afraid? No way. The crown is 40% loose. Just into the deep bow.

622
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:33,479
K-round bowed back. The crown loosened again. Whoa. Oof. Oof. Oof. Oof. No no. Um don't bow

623
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:45,510
and then I'm gonna heal because you just won't listen. Heal prayer. You just won't listen.

624
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:53,939
Oh my god why was I not paying attention? I just think I was staring. Crown is 75% loose.

625
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:03,239
Uh deep bow should do it right? Well then I'll be at 95. Well I think we're fine. Deep bow.

626
01:42:04,039 --> 01:42:14,060
K-round bowed back. Its crown loosened one more time. Time to get in the dryer now.

627
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:23,989
I can't imagine doing that. This is probably some fucking guy on YouTube that was like

628
01:42:23,989 --> 01:42:28,789
you've been going into me bill crazy and today I'm getting in a fucking dryer.

629
01:42:28,789 --> 01:42:37,399
That's right. I'm sure it exists. And we're gonna turn it normally we're gonna turn the dryer on.

630
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:54,390
We're gonna put it on high heat and high speed. I'm gonna bow this deep bow again.

631
01:42:54,390 --> 01:43:14,380
I'm not doing this bullshit. I ain't going on like the permanent press. I think I won.

632
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:17,260
Have I made this joke before about getting in the dryer if I lost?

633
01:43:17,899 --> 01:43:22,789
You clowns really are heroes. You saved the next 20 minutes of my life.

634
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:28,010
We? What do you mean we? We? What do they say we?

635
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:34,090
Yeah Bill I'm making a reference to Bill crazy again because he's gonna be in the rumble

636
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:37,289
next weekend. Like I have to I have to bring some of these characters that you haven't heard

637
01:43:37,289 --> 01:43:40,250
of in a while back so you know when you see them in the rumble that like it's like oh

638
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:46,949
there he is. Oh yeah if you weren't at the green screen stream this next weekend here is

639
01:43:47,829 --> 01:43:55,670
Germany in 2018. That's like 600 characters. That's a lie. I'm lying a lot tonight.

640
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:56,630
I gotta stop lying to you.

641
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:03,000
Uh Suzy enough downplay your contributions but you uh you didn't actually help at all.

642
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
You only made everything worse by attacking. If you had just acted nice to it in the

643
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,960
first place you could have avoided that entire battle.

644
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:18,199
Are you for real? That thing was bloodthirsty. The only thing keeping it at bay was my axe.

645
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:25,130
And earlier you terrorized those troops. Those guys were enemies therefore terrorizing.

646
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:30,090
Yeah she's right. And before that you ate an innocent person's cake.

647
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:33,369
Cakes are also my enemy.

648
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:41,800
Suzy whether you like it or not you're a hero. One with the power to bring peace to the future.

649
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:45,079
Could you please start acting like one?

650
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:51,399
Yeah when you lay it out like that I've been a pretty bad hero haven't I?

651
01:44:51,399 --> 01:45:00,170
Alright you got it. I'll change my ways. From now on I won't be such a rotten hero anymore.

652
01:45:01,449 --> 01:45:03,210
I'll just be one of the bad guys instead.

653
01:45:05,529 --> 01:45:08,409
Really? You're going to be on my team?

654
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:15,369
Yeah sounds way easier honestly. Suzy you can't just...

655
01:45:16,329 --> 01:45:22,090
Quiet toothpaste boy. Suzy is my comrade now. Hey yeah toothpaste boy.

656
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:26,890
We're going to have monogrammed track jackets.

657
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:32,100
Yeah at sleepovers where we tell each other the secrets.

658
01:45:32,899 --> 01:45:38,340
Um yeah anyway uh see you guys never if you can even last that long.

659
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:44,550
Perhaps I shouldn't have been so hard on her.

660
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:52,250
But I just worry that if Suzy is too eager to fight then well let's just be kind to her

661
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:54,890
okay. I'm sure Suzy will come around soon.

662
01:46:00,869 --> 01:46:07,640
Well blocking foliage grows thick above your head. The power of the forest shines within you.

663
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:14,899
101 minutes and 37 hours. It's not that bad.

664
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:18,020
Hey kid we met us to fix up this old thing of a jig for you.

665
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:21,859
It's some kind of door. It can take you anywhere you want in the world.

666
01:46:21,859 --> 01:46:23,619
As long as that's one of the two locations.

667
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:27,779
Anywho we'll keep working on it. Anything to help you out kid.

668
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:35,130
Oh there horsey. Mr. Society and the puzzle guy fixed that door.

669
01:46:35,689 --> 01:46:38,890
Since it was just the three of us it should work without any issues.

670
01:46:39,609 --> 01:46:42,489
Anyhow I hope it helps you deal with the king.

671
01:46:44,779 --> 01:46:48,140
Now don't tell anyone Mr. Society helped. He doesn't want none of that.

672
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,630
I'm watching you now with my nostrils.

673
01:46:51,189 --> 01:47:02,329
It's a door. Where will you go?

674
01:47:03,539 --> 01:47:06,739
Field forest. Uh field. The door open.

675
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:13,579
Okay so this okay this is the door to go back.

676
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:25,289
All right. Ah! Uh oh.

677
01:47:25,289 --> 01:47:26,890
Rabbic slithered in the way.

678
01:47:29,029 --> 01:47:33,510
Uh breathe all? Press zebra peel to blow air.

679
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:42,899
Freshing boy. How does that mean?

680
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:47,300
Looking for a couch to get stuck under.

681
01:47:48,659 --> 01:47:51,909
All right. No no no no! Okay I did it.

682
01:47:52,630 --> 01:47:59,420
Press the button too many times.

683
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:03,859
I did attack and I thought I was gonna punch the person.

684
01:48:03,859 --> 01:48:04,180
All right.

685
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,260
Suzy! Lancer!

686
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:12,229
Hey hey hey.

687
01:48:13,109 --> 01:48:15,670
Well if it isn't the so-called heroes.

688
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:17,770
Are you finally ready to see what happens?

689
01:48:18,569 --> 01:48:23,210
When you try to act soft against a team that crushes anyone in their way.

690
01:48:24,569 --> 01:48:25,850
Dark Jack Lancer.

691
01:48:26,489 --> 01:48:27,770
Violent Axe Suzy.

692
01:48:28,489 --> 01:48:33,130
Together we are the Dark Lancer fan club.

693
01:48:33,770 --> 01:48:36,789
So what's your evil plan?

694

revolve around the center and look carefully well let me check up whoa easy now just want

904
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:25,500
to go all the way around just take a look that is to go around the center so like here

905
02:27:26,459 --> 02:27:32,250
the darker it gets it easier it is to see so the lights are turning off

906
02:27:35,659 --> 02:27:40,520
hey it's getting that's coming up here okay it's like a weird bird person

912
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:10,459

913
02:29:10,459 --> 02:29:19,909

915
02:29:24,950 --> 02:29:31,989
sweet not only is it way more fun than being good but my teammate's proud of what i do

916
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:37,350
you earlier suzy ate a pine cone off the floor it gave her a terrible stomachache

917
02:29:38,149 --> 02:29:52,360
it was very brave and cool see finally some respect somehow prince lancer has made real

918
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:57,959
friends with a lightener so somebody should tell the king immediately it's definitely not

919
02:29:57,959 --> 02:30:04,389
going to be me whoever breaks the news is going to get wrecked uh how's the thrash

920
02:30:04,389 --> 02:30:09,690
machine we designed going uh the what machine the machine we had a whole sequence about it

921
02:30:10,729 --> 02:30:16,090
oh that yeah we'll make it at the last minute you two should really start working on it earlier

922
02:30:18,139 --> 02:30:28,200
what's with the lecture i didn't come here for a second dad hey yeah you tell them oh why does

924
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:42,389
obligatory it's no wonder nobody really likes him damn no by the way beware yourselves of the

925
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:47,829
forest maze you'll probably get completely lost without someone who knows the way through that is

926
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:57,450
yeah i know the forest like the back of my head oh there's a and and even even on even

935
02:32:52,170 --> 02:32:57,049
you let him wander off by himself you know he's bad at mazes right he's probably lost and

936
02:32:57,049 --> 02:33:02,920
confused right now i've lost and confused sorry susie we didn't mean to make you worry

937
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:08,260

938
02:33:09,059 --> 02:33:14,569
there's all anyway get out of my way i'm gonna find him see if she doesn't know the right way

939
02:33:14,569 --> 02:33:29,000
either well they go go the way that they're not going what what was the hitbox on that come on man

940
02:33:33,739 --> 02:33:48,200
ah go back can i go back uh whatever i keep forgetting because i could have just done uh

941
02:33:48,760 --> 02:34:03,639
spare instead of uh sitting here like this in defense mode sorry germa for asking if you're

942
02:34:03,639 --> 02:34:07,239
pissed off and causing a wave of people telling you to calm down we all love you can't wait for

943
02:34:07,239 --> 02:34:16,020
germania no i'm just kidding around i didn't i don't remember where they even went well i was

944
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:21,780
wrong damn i was sure he went this way no way he could save his own damn self i went the wrong

945
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:49,559
fucking way too oh no oh shit okay i could do the whole thing again right up the middle

946
02:34:50,440 --> 02:35:00,950
and then on the right i don't want to fight you and then oh shit where are they go to the left

947
02:35:02,069 --> 02:35:17,940
right at the middle i got it got it bad because mad bad is mad mad because bad

948
02:35:18,579 --> 02:35:23,059
oh look it's our toy with the toy we made isn't that the machine we designed all right

949
02:35:23,059 --> 02:35:33,180
this will be tough but let's try our best oh that's uh it's not good actually oh you

950
02:35:33,180 --> 02:35:41,940
think that's bad just wait and see what happens when it starts the design sucked so we blew it up

951
02:35:43,239 --> 02:35:51,510
oh i see so now what's your plan going to be turns out we didn't need a plan just a rule

952
02:35:52,629 --> 02:35:59,450
anyone that gets in our way gets crushed into dust that's a pretty good rule but suzy you

953
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:04,809
need us to return home doesn't crushing us seem a little counterproductive nah so that's where

954
02:36:04,889 --> 02:36:12,250
you're wrong you see i know i can't get back without you guys but being a good guy really

955
02:36:12,250 --> 02:36:19,059
isn't my style so i thought of a little way we can just settle this if you can beat me i'll go

956
02:36:19,059 --> 02:36:25,540
back to being a good guy but if you lose you guys will have to become bad guys with us

957
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:33,030
and do whatever we say oh our wish is your command so what do you say

958
02:36:33,430 --> 02:36:49,430
um okay we were just gonna thrash you anyways see ya two bad guys blocked away

959
02:36:50,069 --> 02:36:59,739
i've got suzy and we have lancer lancer probably easier to deal with x anything anything anything

960
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:06,680
i'm told ralcy to compliment the enemies you two look like a really great team i'm proud

961
02:37:07,239 --> 02:37:12,920
lancer started to become a little convinced oh it's working on me flattery won't work

962
02:37:19,319 --> 02:37:31,750
uh suzy and lancer are making fun of you uh let's try suzy sing let's try to sing

963
02:37:33,049 --> 02:37:38,889
ralcy saying a soft and entrancing lullaby doesn't she go to sleep suzy fell asleep

964
02:37:40,010 --> 02:37:49,930
oh what a beautiful song smells like teamwork all right uh so suzy's asleep

965
02:37:50,889 --> 02:38:00,809
so now lancer can i you told the logically best lancer and suzy you too if we don't stop fighting

966
02:38:00,809 --> 02:38:13,000
then someone might get hurt lancer became more convinced it's working really that's bad ow

967
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:24,620
having an evil laugh contest well she's asleep same thing do again you told her to offer his

968
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:29,819
you told ralcy to offer his services to the enemies you too if we stop fighting then i could

969
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:36,780
uh i could braid your hair lancer became almost fully convinced wow i'll look amazing i'm awake

970
02:38:36,780 --> 02:38:56,899
did i miss anything all right let's do the same thing sing suzy to sleep good night what a beautiful

971
02:38:56,899 --> 02:39:05,559
song whoa why for some reason thought it was a dumb an idiot let's convince lancer told

972
02:39:05,559 --> 02:39:11,190
ralcy to come deal a final blow of kindness i in summary i'd like you to and i think we

973
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:18,389
should all just get along uh oh what's wrong dude i accidentally started liking the enemies

974
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:24,780
now seeing them just makes me feel round and soft bad atmosphere for battle though

975
02:39:26,819 --> 02:39:35,319
well if you don't want to fight there's no point i guess battles over well you didn't

976
02:39:35,319 --> 02:39:43,719
beat us because you uh kind of cheated by ganging up on lancer with uh kindness but if

977
02:39:43,719 --> 02:39:47,479
i have to i guess i'll go back to your side but don't expect me to do anything but fight

978
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:56,299
well we're happy to have you back suzy yeah yeah let's just hurry up and go home

979
02:39:56,299 --> 02:40:04,120
i know what about him um suzy does this mean that we aren't a team anymore

980
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:14,459
uh i mean uh of course we're still a team you can uh be part of the lancer fan club

981
02:40:15,739 --> 02:40:22,069
wow me in the lancer fan club wait if i hang out with the good guys then

982
02:40:22,629 --> 02:40:32,010

983
02:40:37,850 --> 02:40:53,430
lancer joins the team lancer joined the party this is a huge party wait why is he not he's not

984
02:40:53,430 --> 02:41:10,180
following you can follow behind us you know oh okay chad it's a lone door frame but for some reason

985
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:25,750
you can't see through it wow this is cool i've never been on such a big team before

986
02:41:26,549 --> 02:41:31,909
don't you have a legion of various guys yeah but my dad forced them to listen to me

987
02:41:31,909 --> 02:41:38,950

1026
02:48:50,329 --> 02:48:53,610
life cannot exist without consuming even the moss drinks water

1027
02:48:54,170 --> 02:49:09,139
yeah perpetuate the cycle of existence you ate the moss tastes mossy your hp was mossed out

1028
02:49:10,500 --> 02:49:18,969

1029
02:49:19,850 --> 02:49:23,610
what's all that green stuff around your mouth two minutes in jail and you've already resorted

1030
02:49:23,610 --> 02:49:30,139
to eating moss uh you're a real go-getter chris so you couldn't find anything well chris

1031
02:49:30,139 --> 02:49:34,780

thanks for helping her chris she appreciates it chris are you worried about suzy kind of

1043
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:38,649
probably i mean probably seems like she's very she's very influenceable she joined the bad guys

1044
02:51:38,649 --> 02:51:43,770
because she wanted to be a bad guy i know i'm a little concerned well regardless of how you feel

1045
02:51:43,770 --> 02:51:48,010
i don't think it would hurt to take a moment close your eyes and think about what she's doing

1046
02:51:48,010 --> 02:52:02,360
now uh-oh another puzzle out of the cell where to next oh fuck and there's a scary monster over

you go uh where was is it wasn't the bake sale it was with the bake sale there it is okay

1128
03:06:04,709 --> 03:06:12,219
so you got a secret start talking strange prisoner uh what are you talking about a

1129
03:06:12,219 --> 03:06:18,790
prisoner with an odd manner no you couldn't possibly be talking about him i see after all

1130
03:06:18,790 --> 03:06:24,229
the trouble i went through to lock him up you want to release him uh now that you mentioned

1131
03:06:24,229 --> 03:06:28,549
it it could be troublesome if he was left alone yes perhaps it's better if you heroes

1132
03:06:28,549 --> 03:06:32,950
dealt with him now after all it's not as if whatever happens will matter in the end

1133
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:40,229
perhaps a little chaos might be fun so then take this broken key a was added to your key items

1134
03:06:41,190 --> 03:06:44,549
if you're so driven find the other two pieces and get someone to fix them

1135
03:06:45,270 --> 03:06:51,129
i'll even give you a hint walk where the stars don't shine if you succeed come back

1136
03:06:51,129 --> 03:06:56,440
here and i'll and tell me good luck and call this luck no it's more like a curse

1137
03:06:57,399 --> 03:07:05,379
but the star okay it mattered to me but here's a walk where the stars don't shine

1138
03:07:07,139 --> 03:07:27,930
where the stars don't shine i mean that's he's talking about darkness like is this the way

1144
03:08:59,639 --> 03:09:19,979

1149
03:11:03,989 --> 03:11:14,469
are those stars not shining i mean it looks like over here what is in there there's probably a

1150
03:11:14,469 --> 03:11:37,750
broken key in there where the stars don't shine let's do a breathe all and you can spare

1151

1308
03:47:40,329 --> 03:47:46,170
defeated him i see perhaps you three may truly be heroes after all jevil was just a taste

1309
03:47:46,170 --> 03:47:51,930
of what you'll face from now on one day soon you too will begin to realize the futility of

1310
03:47:51,930 --> 03:47:57,049
your actions ha ha ha at that time feel free to come back here i'll make you tea

1311
03:47:57,690 --> 03:48:06,760
and we can toast to the end of the world he was a funny little man once the court jester

1312
03:48:06,760 --> 03:48:13,000
i the court magician a friend could i consider him a friend perhaps perhaps not but he was

1313
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:17,559
the only one who matched me in the games we used to play one day he met a strange

1314
03:48:17,559 --> 03:48:21,719
someone and since then he began to change started saying bizarre things that didn't

1315
03:48:21,719 --> 03:48:27,989
completely make sense but didn't completely not make sense either soon he began to see

1316
03:48:27,989 --> 03:48:33,110
the world as a game and everyone as its participants as the court major and his

1317
03:48:33,110 --> 03:48:39,270
only companion i was forced to lock him away or rather lock us all away in his own words

1318
03:48:40,309 --> 03:48:45,430
since that time the strange words he said have stuck inside my cotton and my view of

1319
03:48:45,430 --> 03:48:50,469
this world has become darker yet darker reflecting on these old memories i think perhaps

1320
03:48:50,469 --> 03:48:55,909
i miss playing games with him and i wonder if i hadn't been asked to lock him up would i

1321

1489
04:19:49,930 --> 04:19:55,129
there once was a time where darkners and lighteners lived in harmony the time where

1490
04:19:55,129 --> 04:20:02,329
darkners could fulfill their purpose and peace it would be a lie it would be a lie uh-oh

1491
04:20:03,290 --> 04:20:12,329
to say that i too do not yearn for those days perhaps perhaps you young ones are right

scenarios where like now i did it wrong because i did the other way i did it wrong this time

1515
04:23:46,170 --> 04:23:51,750
it's complicated yeah sometimes there's people you just got to fight but if you never let

1516
04:23:51,750 --> 04:23:58,549
your guard down then you might just hurt someone you care about oh susie you're beginning

04:38:21,029 --> 04:38:25,669
cat ears with a darker storyline and more mature themes the second one treats the viewer

1614
04:38:25,669 --> 04:38:30,630
like a real adult instead of like an animal that will die if it goes 10 seconds without

1615

05:04:00,840 --> 05:04:05,880
suzy i'm kind of curious what she's like you know i mean who doesn't wonder about her she

1800
05:04:05,880 --> 05:04:14,939

1801
05:04:14,939 --> 05:04:20,380
you against the lockers gosh chris i'm really sorry that's just awful i thought i thought

1802
05:04:20,380 --> 05:04:24,459
she she was good just maybe it would take someone special to find her good side

1803
05:04:25,020 --> 05:04:31,560
but she really is terrible isn't she chris i'm so sorry you have to go through with this

1804
05:04:31,560 --> 05:04:36,439

1805
05:04:36,439 --> 05:04:41,159
you know so you wouldn't have to be the one who um gets to be slammed into lockers

1806
05:04:41,159 --> 05:04:51,939

out the heart interesting well that's that's so okay um you could move around the cage i was so i

1869
05:17:54,979 --> 05:18:03,689
was the heart well i mean that's that's all right that was delta rune uh let me try i take

1870
05:18:03,689 --> 05:18:08,599
care of this so here's uh the folder it's in i just want to make sure that nothing was in

1871
05:18:08,599 --> 05:18:41,750
here because if you want to install the game you can fuck it up so okay it's in here the

1872
05:18:41,750 --> 05:18:54,250
jevil item oh fuck you're right the only thing stopping me from making this joke is the jevil

1873
05:18:54,250 --> 05:19:05,130
item i was about to do it and then i realized that the jevil item well let's back it up a

1874
05:19:05,130 --> 05:19:10,630
little bit here i don't want to lose that i don't want to lose that never mind i'm not

1875
05:19:10,630 --> 05:19:25,610
making this stupid joke anyways you don't keep it what do you mean i don't keep it

1876
05:19:31,080 --> 05:19:42,150
but yeah that was delta rune i'll give you what i think about it um i i think it was an interesting

1877
05:19:42,150 --> 05:19:52,779
start it's free there really is if you are a fan of undertale if you liked undertale i mean

1878
05:19:52,779 --> 05:19:59,450
like what where's the harm in playing it it's it's just free i is it is the whole thing

1879
05:19:59,450 --> 05:20:12,340
going to be free no maybe not probably not there's no no there's yeah there's no way to

1880
05:20:13,659 --> 05:20:23,209
um i thought i thought it was cute i thought it was interesting but without the whole experience

1881
05:20:23,209 --> 05:20:27,209
it's hard to be like well you know there's my problem with what i think about the story

1882
05:20:27,209 --> 05:20:36,139
like i don't how am i supposed to give you an opinion on that did i play the first game on

1883
05:20:36,139 --> 05:20:40,860
stream i did very long time ago that was probably like it was one of the first games

1884
05:20:40,860 --> 05:20:53,369
i ever streamed in its entirety on twitch wasn't it chapter two is the rest of the game

1885
05:20:53,369 --> 05:21:00,409

thanks for looking for the one dollar hey germa i don't feel like removing periods and commas to

2111
05:55:12,540 --> 05:55:16,459
tell you an extremely short summary of what happened in our castle griffinstein arc

2112
05:55:16,459 --> 05:55:21,580
so please read this on stream it was the most fun i've had in our campaign yet it was

2113
05:55:21,580 --> 05:55:26,220
wonderful thanks for being such a creative and talented person we love you almost as much

2114
05:55:26,220 --> 05:55:36,700
as carl let's see see the party slayed al goro and gave trogg a burial they encountered

2115
05:55:36,700 --> 05:55:41,020
the rabbit people and purchased everything from the shop malice the goliath fired the ray

2116
05:55:41,020 --> 05:55:45,020
gun and blew the hole blew a hole in the shop's wall they were soon chased out and

2117
05:55:45,020 --> 05:55:49,340
encountered the horde of zombies coming face to face with al gulu i threw a single stone and

2118
05:55:49,340 --> 05:55:53,419
killed the demon in one hit upon reaching the final room the wizard offered the party an answer

2119
05:55:53,419 --> 05:55:58,299
to any question that they would ask under the condition that it was one question asking what

2120
05:55:58,299 --> 05:56:03,099
happened to carl instead of asking about the two people we came to the castle to save the

2121
05:56:03,099 --> 05:56:07,500
shotgun picked up by malice was pulled from his hand and blew a hole into the wizard's chest

2122
05:56:07,500 --> 05:56:10,619
reality began to distort around him as the party found themselves floating on a single

2123
05:56:10,619 --> 05:56:15,900
platform in a red cosmic void staring down at carl himself cursed by a powerful ring

2124
05:56:15,900 --> 05:56:21,340
carl attacked the party driven by greed to find more chips i pulled the ring from carl's finger

2125
05:56:21,340 --> 05:56:25,659
and carl dissolved into smoke before the entire dungeon began to warp and collapse into itself

2126
05:56:26,220 --> 05:56:30,060
running out the party narrowly escaped and returned to town to inform the barbarians of

2127
05:56:30,060 --> 05:56:35,900
trogg's defeat then the barbarians got absolutely pissed absolutely pissed for disturbing

2128
05:56:35,900 --> 05:56:40,540
the ritual of the warrior's harvest with that we completed the castle griffin's deed

2129
05:56:41,419 --> 05:56:47,340
all in all carl became a corrupt god driven by greed for chips and was soon dealt with after

2130
05:56:47,340 --> 05:56:57,619
being found we love you germa that sounds like a pretty fitting end why didn't you ask if the

2144
05:58:48,860 --> 05:58:55,900
favorite streamer germa 985 the germa 985 the top 1000 streamer the the one who

2145
05:58:55,979 --> 05:59:02,540
beat dark souls on stream yeah dude the germa 985 who made rant movie if i get gnomed

2146
05:59:02,540 --> 05:59:05,099
uh i'm making the minimum bits five dollars

2147
05:59:06,139 --> 05:59:09,500
hey so griffin stayed dude i was like laughing about that one a little bit

2148
05:59:09,500 --> 05:59:14,939
like you mean the germa 985 who had his house invested by wasps so like when a wasp went in

2149
05:59:14,939 --> 05:59:19,340
his room he was like you know going on diet it's not that big of a wait wait hold on wait

2150
05:59:19,340 --> 05:59:23,900
till he lands wait till he lands then he snaps his finger the wasp blows up his house blows up

2151
05:59:23,900 --> 05:59:29,180
and then he goes up in smoke whoa wait the virus the virus i just had like the weirdest

2152
05:59:29,180 --> 05:59:34,540
thought right now what if garfield set up a camera in our house they say in our house

2153
05:59:34,540 --> 05:59:39,900
it's undyed's house was the only background i could get but but but what what garfield like

2154
05:59:39,900 --> 05:59:44,939
put a camera in our house it was like spying on us so sans if what i'm hearing is correct

2155
05:59:44,939 --> 05:59:49,259
you're saying like he's recording us and just because we're talking about germa he's got i'm

2156
05:59:49,259 --> 05:59:53,659
waiting for a gnome so like put it in one of his garpographs and then he's going to send it

2157
05:59:53,659 --> 05:59:58,060
to him at the end of the delta rune stream yeah that's exactly what i'm saying well that's

2158
05:59:58,060 --> 06:00:02,860
kind of lame like like we're just standing here talking about germa and like that constitutes

2159
06:00:02,860 --> 06:00:08,459
putting us in a video and then wasting germa's time on stream to watch this this garbage

2160
06:00:08,459 --> 06:00:11,979
yeah dude something's gotta happen to make it a little bit more fun you know yeah bro
