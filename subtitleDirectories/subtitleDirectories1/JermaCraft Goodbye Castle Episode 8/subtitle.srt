00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:14,710
Hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome back to Germacraft. I know it's been a quite a

2
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,109
while since I came up with a Germacraft episode, but I'm going to give you a whole list of

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:27,100
excuses right now. All right. So the holidays were around and why am I holding my bed? What

4
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,859
happened last episode? Did I, did I, my bed should be in here, right? Yes. Okay. So what

5
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,859
happened is obviously the holidays came around and I didn't really have a whole lot of time

6
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,140
to play this game because it takes a while. You got to sit down and really do stuff for

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,560
a couple hours. And I didn't really have that couple hours to really sit down and play.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,679
So, but now I do. So let's start playing, huh? What, what is going on here? What is

9
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:02,189
going on with the side of my house? Jeez Louise. Oh, okay. I know I want that there.

10
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:07,879
I want that there. So today we're going to do a couple of things in this episode. I'm

11
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:14,870
going to do this. I'm going to go on a grand adventure because obviously if you watched

12
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:20,769
from the very beginning in episode one, I said, Oh, don't worry. By Christmas time,

13
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:27,049
I'll have a castle. And as you can completely, totally tell that is absolutely not happening

14
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:31,939
and did not happen. So I'm going to go out and go on a crazy adventure and try to kill

15
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:38,780
a bunch of stuff. Okay. I got the sword now. We're good. Do I need anything else? Oh, got

16
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,739
to eat this rotten flesh before I die. Keep eating it. Oh yeah. Poisoned. So let's, let's

17
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,219
just go. I'm going to go out there. I'm going to try and find, I'm going to try and find

18
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:58,299
a new spot to hang out. Cause in reality, realistically, this is just too far away from

19
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,840
all of civilization. So I'm going to have to find somewhere else. So say goodbye to

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,469
this house for now. I don't think, I don't know if I'll ever come back to it or not,

21
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:15,819
but yeah, let's say goodbye. Let's wave to the stupid sea house that never really went

22
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:23,099
anywhere. So I'm going to sing a goodbye song to the castle that never was. So as we see

23
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,789
it in the distance there, let's all wave goodbye to it. Goodbye. And let's sing my song to

24
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:37,909
the castle. It starts raining. It started raining. Oh my God. Perfect.

25
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:59,169
My castle never ended up completing. And I'm scared of what's going to happen in the

26
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:06,889
next episode. But it's okay if we stay true to each other. We get up on a mountainside

27
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:15,979
and find some other place to live. Goodbye castle. I got to find my way up and down the

28
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:22,180
stairs. I'm going to find my way inside of this mountain cab. We're going to go goodbye

29
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:32,129
castle. And that's how we go. We end the song there. Let's just, why am I going this way?

30
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:42,090
Goodbye castle. It was great knowing you. Let's go. You're probably wondering why I'm

31
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,729
back in the castle. It's because I didn't take any of the stuff that I'm supposed to

32
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:54,370
take. I left it all here. So I'm going to take that. That stuff can stay. I need the

33
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,009
bed though. The bed is an absolute must and I didn't, I left without it. So okay, bye.

34
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:08,020
Bye now castle. Bye. Trying to get up this whole mountain here is kind of being a little

35
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,319
more difficult than I initially thought it was going to be. I have to scale this whole

36
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,529
mountain and I'm trying to do that. And while it's cold here, oh well, I'm trying to jump

37
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:26,379
up here. I just can't get over here. Maybe I should just make it. I'm like really seriously

38
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:33,339
trying to think of a good way to do this. How to make it. Maybe I should make the next

39
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:40,420
house on top of this mountain maybe? I don't know, but I'm, whoa, what, what? Oh God, I'm

40
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,459
starving to death again. How many times is this going to happen to me? Eating raw beef.

41
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:51,100
Oh my, you know what, I'm going to eat the whole damn thing. Oh hey, that's my ring tone.

42
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:57,579
Hold on, somebody's calling me. My ring tone is a duck, if you can hear that. Hold on,

43
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:11,220
I've got to answer this. Hold on. Hello? Hi mom. What's up? I'm making a commentary for

44
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:19,129
YouTube. Yeah, so I made it on top of the mountain. That's a good thing. So do I build

45
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,410
my house here is the real question. I don't know, I know, you know what, I'm going to

46
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,410
build it down here because this is just going to be a pain in the ass if I ever decide to

47
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,600
do anything. So I'm going to come down here. I'm going to die if I jump down there. Do

48
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,560
not die. If I die right now, it is a very, very bad thing because I really don't want

49
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,480
to come all the way back here again. All right, we're good. We're doing some scaling, some

50
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,819
good mountains. Oh, look at that. Look at that parkour. All right, right here. I'm going

51
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,850
to do it right here. The house is going to be built right here. Good shore view. Got

52
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:01,069
a nice little spot right here. Going right here. Eventually, I'm sure I'll put wood here.

53
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:07,699
Or maybe I might even just go back to the old house to, you know, scavenge the supplies.

54
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:14,189
I don't know. But I had to get out of that place. That place was ridiculous. And that

55
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:21,750
reminds me of a story. Story time. Okay. We can talk about story time right now. So when

56
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:26,779
I say get out of this place, it brought me back to when I was in college. When I was

57
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:32,350
in college, hold on, let me, because I got plenty of dirt. I can make a little quasi

58
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:39,660
fake house. Okay. So when I was in college, I lived in the dormitories for a couple years,

59
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,639
and then I decided to move, obviously, when you're like a junior and a senior in college,

60
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
you want to move to like the bigger, cooler, like apartments, because you want to be like

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,199
a cool person. Like I'm not in the dorm. I'm in the apartments, because I'm the man. That's

62
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,939
kind of what goes through your head sometimes. So I got an apartment, and I got the apartment

63
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,779
without looking at it. I didn't really know, because I was late to put my thing in to get

64
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,220
signed up for the dormitories. So I kind of had no choice. I had to just kind of run and

65
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,720
find an apartment last minute. And I found this little place. I didn't see it. I just

66
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,050
knew that it existed. It was about, I don't know, maybe half a mile away from the college.

67
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,009
So I made a phone call, got the whole thing secured. Okay, let me get the lease. Where

68
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,529
is it? Blah, blah, blah. And I came to realize, I came to find out later, when I actually

69
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:31,139
went there, that it was a box. The place wasn't even a house. It was just literally a box

70
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:37,500
like this. Just like, it was like this big. It was one little, it was a studio apartment,

71
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,569
right? So it was one small room with a bathroom like right over there. And it was horrible.

72
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,529
And I had to live there. I had to share it with somebody. So I had this one box room

73
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:54,209
that was probably, I'm going to be realistic, it was probably really as big as this Minecraft

74
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,250
room I just made. And I had to share it with two people. Well, one person, so we had two

75
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,889
people in there. But I just remember that it was one of the most ridiculous things ever,

76
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:09,410
and I had to stay there for the whole year. So I guess the moral of the story is if you're

77
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,709
going to live somewhere, make sure you like check out where it is first, besides like

78
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,519
just buying it and being like, yeah, I'll show up, thanks. Because I had a lot of bad

79
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,060
experiences there. It just got to me after a while. It just stressed me out. The fact

80
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,500
that there was just this tiny little room, and I couldn't have, I had no privacy, I was

81
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,340
sitting right next to the person that lived right next to me. So it really, really was

82
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,629
a real pain in the ass. And yeah, but that's the story of Jerma's box house that he really

83
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:47,830
actually existed and lived in. I eventually moved out of there, though. I got out and

84
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,320
I went back to live with some of my friends in college. But yeah, don't ever buy real

85
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,659
estate without seeing it, or you'll puke. All right, let's get this thing. This should

86
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:05,450
be the last layer right here. And then I should be able to make the roof, put the bed down,

87
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,240
put a couple lights in it, and go to sleep.
