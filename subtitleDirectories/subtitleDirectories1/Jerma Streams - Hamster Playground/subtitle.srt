1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:06,280
Okay, hamster playground it is. Somebody, we were talking about this the other day, right?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,539
Somebody in mod chat put this in the mod chat. Let's see, let's see how it is.

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:19,980
I don't even have the game installed. This game is 12 gigs? Wow. Well, let's try.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:29,530
We're gonna, you're gonna F a little bit because I'm downloading a game.

5
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:40,460
I just, oh, okay, I won't move so there won't be like a lot of data.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:01:53,129
40%, 53%, 80%. Yeah, that's the power of fiber. When it works, it's great.

7
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:58,120
I just downloaded a 12 gig game in like maybe one and a half minutes straight. That's it.

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:15,189
Back to normal. Okay, so this is called hamster playground. We made the hamster joke before.

9
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:29,979
Hopefully the game's not too loud. Let's just double check that it isn't.

10
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:37,460
Hamster playground. We might actually leave this in 10 minutes tops.

11
00:02:37,460 --> 00:03:35,879
Can you see? Okay, I select your house. Why can't you see it? Um, it's like my house.

12
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:59,259
House one. Great. Um, hammy zone. Ham zone to play.

13
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:08,780
What kind of hamsters or their cards to select them? Use arrow keys or WASD on the...

14
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,699
Uh, we'll click on the floor and hold the mouse button to move around the house.

15
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,540
You need to take care of your hamsters. They need to eat, drink, play, sleep, groom, and poop.

16
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:32,899
You can click on... Okay. Select a hamster and then click on a device to tell them to use it.

17
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:37,430
You can also train your hamsters to make them stronger, more agile, intelligent, or determined.

18
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,670
Click the mouse button as fast as possible to reach the green field before the time runs out.

19
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,790
Click to stop in the arrow field. Find the cards from the top row. What is this?

20
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:57,139
Oh, what is this? What is so dirty? Do I even have a hamster?

21
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:37,740
It's just my house? Where's the, where's the hamster? What is this? It wants to play a lot.

22
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:51,560
Wait, okay. It's definitely this one. 100%. It likes to play a lot. That's fine. Booty.

23
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:11,610
Clean freak. Was there one on the page? All right, this game just, I thought that

24
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:35,529
it was going to be a realistic game, but now it's like a cartoon game. Um, I don't know. Howard?

25
00:06:35,850 --> 00:07:15,699
Okay. Stop. Okay. Easy. Be careful. All right. You want to eat food? What we got?

26
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:38,149
The snacks over here. It is butt. Okay. Where's water? I mean, what? Hey, look at this hamster

27
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:59,589
butt. It's, he's got like this poofy hamster bum. What are you eating? Huh? What? That's, why is

28
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:07,300
that weird? He's got like a little funny tail and he's got like a funny bum. What are you, what is,

29
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:20,410
what are you guys on about? All right. Come wear a hat. How much money do I have?

30
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:55,750
I didn't buy that. Did I? No. Um, yeah, I think so. I don't need to see anymore.

31
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:03,480
I don't see anything else. Why would the hamster have this on? They wear clothes?

32
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:23,509
Hold on. They wear like t-shirts? This is just Winnie the Pooh. Okay. All right. Whatever. Red

33
00:09:23,509 --> 00:10:07,990
shirt. All right. Go take a, take a bath and then go use the bathroom. Done? Okay. Quest complete.

34
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:20,039
Okay. Put your hamster to bed. Play a race. Train strength, dexterity, intelligence.

35
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:36,950
Why are there stat points? Wait, where's my gift? Where's my gift? I should have a gift,

36
00:10:36,950 --> 00:11:24,820
right? Go to bed? All right. Go to bed for a minute. Okay. That looks like fun. This song,

37
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:55,940
I don't know. Okay. So now what? We play a game? What's this? This is like, wait, we're strength

38
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:13,799
training? Wait, I want it to be intelligent and strong. Oh, that's determination. All right.

39
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:31,779
What's intelligence? Dabba dee ba dabba. Dabba dee ba dabba. I have to get out of here. Dexterity?

40
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:56,309
How do you train? Where are the books? What does this train? Oh, okay. Going down the slide.

41
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:06,970
Nice job. All right. We need, I need intelligence. Wait, is gaming playing, is this an arcade game?

42
00:13:07,929 --> 00:14:11,429
Is this it? Dabba dee. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. Level up. Is he tired? No, not, not at all.

43
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:33,509
Not tired at all. In fact, he's having a great time. Is that his brain growing when he's done?

44
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:45,610
When he's like, is that his brain growing? Wait, 20 out of 20. I, I can't get smarter than this.

45
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:59,639
This is as intelligent as I could possibly be. What does that mean? All right. We're going to do

46
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:29,610
intelligence and determination. How are you doing? Still fine. Are you certified with a forklift?

47
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:43,059
No. What happens when I get to level 20 for everything? I get to level up the character?

48
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:59,769
Has it been 10 minutes? No, not yet. Oh, okay. Wait, now. Does that mean? All right. He doesn't

49
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:06,730
want to do this anymore. All right. Let's go. Go jump on the trampoline for like an hour or

50
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:27,980
whatever. I mean, what if you want to do? Oh, I can't afford it. Would you ever own a tiger?

51
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:44,409
Oh my God. No tiger. A tiger would just one day randomly would be annoyed the way you were sitting

52
00:16:44,409 --> 00:17:04,819
on the couch and would just attack you. All right. Water deserved. Yeah. The way that you

53
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,500
lift up your arm to change the channel would be like, let's see what is on. Let's see what's on.

54
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:18,710
Okay. Anything would just be like, it's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

55
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,859
Well, what do you, what would you even, how do you, what would you feed a tiger?

56
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:34,759
Just like raw chickens. What do you, what would you do? Is it just like an alligator where they

57
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,369
just throw like the raw meat in the alligator's mouth? Is it one of those scenarios where it's

58
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:52,440
like, okay, okay, take it. And it's like, right. Just raw meat. That's what I mean. Like raw meat,

59
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,000
like raw chicken, raw, you just like have to sit there and be like, okay, here's a raw steak.

60
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,599
Take it. Take it. I don't want it. But what the hell you'd be doing?

61
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:18,150
At a taste for human meat. Well, then you wouldn't last an evening with this cat.

62
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:30,950
Get down from there. Get down. Oh, that's it. That's very naughty. Very naughty. Naughty.

63
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,069
You shouldn't be doing that. You're going to be in trouble now.

64
00:18:34,789 --> 00:19:21,430
How do I make money? Oh, I need to, I need to paint the walls. How do I get a new floor?

65
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:47,589
Where'd he go? Where did he go? You didn't Augustus yourself into the tube again, right?

66
00:19:48,809 --> 00:20:26,009
Oh, there you are. What do you want to do? It's kind of fun to a race. I have gifts. Oh,

67
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:38,859
I can afford clothes, I think. All right. Take a shower and then

68
00:20:38,859 --> 00:21:07,109
I'm good. Go to the bathroom. You don't want to do that? What do you want to do?

69
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:14,359
What do you want to do? What do you want to do? Oh, you're fine. Okay. Okay. So what are we over

70
00:21:14,359 --> 00:25:43,799
here? Oh, that's how you do it. Can I pee? I'm going to pee. I'm eating a candy. All right,

71
00:25:43,799 --> 00:26:16,650
let's do it. Let's race. That was a Heath bar. Anybody know what this is? What's this? What's

72
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:39,019
that? What is it? Let's check the middle. Fluffy, super delicious nougat. That's a three musketeers

73
00:26:39,019 --> 00:27:04,250
and it's an S tier. All right. So what do I do? Are there players? Do people play this? Only two

74
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:33,450
players? I don't think anybody's playing. You're going to get streams. It's me and Mr. Broom. Mr.

75
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:41,430
Broom, you very, very clearly just probably downloaded the game. What do we have to do?

76
00:27:42,069 --> 00:28:08,859
Wait, it's me versus Mr. Broom. What do I have to do? Tap? What do I have to do? Oh, Mr. Broom,

77
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:32,569
you're in deep shit. Now find this card. What? What do I have to do? No, I'm going to get the

78
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:38,599
crown. I don't, I didn't understand the games. I actually, I did not understand them. I did not

79
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:50,140
get the games. I want like five more Heath bars. So bad. I'll get it this time. Whatever. All right.

80
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:59,210
There we go. It looks like people have downloaded the game at this point. Come on. Heath bars to

81
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:15,859
Heath bar. Somebody say EO to Heath bar. You are out of your mind. You really are. I ate that.

82
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:26,660
Are we good? Click the mouse button as fast to reach the green field. Stop the arrow,

83
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,420
find the card and click to stop in the shrinking field. All right. Let's go.

84
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:42,119
Kill bro, Albert whiskers and Mr. Broom. I'm the strongest out of all of them. How does this one

85
00:29:42,119 --> 00:30:27,829
work? Tap. What? I'm leaving everybody in the dust. Oh, you're pissed. Nice job, Howard. All right.

86
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:39,609
This game I thought was stupid. I was about to just leave until right now. And I've been shown

87
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:50,579
that that's, this is a fun one. I was so wrong. I did not think there was like a multiplayer

88
00:30:51,849 --> 00:31:19,829
like maze thing. That's cute. That's very cute. And it's adorable eating contest. I just spit

89
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:53,349
in his, I just spit in that person's mouth. Wait, I don't lose. That's a tie. That we,

90
00:31:53,349 --> 00:32:30,440
how did we not tie? I spit right into that other hand's mouth. We're good. We're good.

91
00:32:30,440 --> 00:33:31,160
I eat paper for that. Did I eat paper? I ate paper. Did I eat paper? Sorry. Why did I not click?

92
00:33:31,160 --> 00:34:05,190
You heard it. Was I playing against another player? I didn't. We're good. I didn't eat paper.

93
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:15,960
We're good. I just did not expect that. So I'm just to walk in. Heat bar is so good,

94
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:25,380
but don't put heat bar on anything else. None of that bullshit. Just right out of the can directly.

95
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,349
That's it. I don't want an ice cream. I don't want to just put it like a souffle. No,

96
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:57,590
I just want it out of the wrapper. That's it. Are you guys ready? Not even close.

97
00:35:44,570 --> 00:36:58,789
Oh, wait. I wasn't here. Batman. Oh, that's gross. We didn't see. Good. Worst moment on the stream.

98
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:47,269
Why? I was trying to do the Jack Nicholson Joker. It's close. Is this what it looked like?

99
00:37:47,269 --> 00:38:07,510
That's not what it looked like, right? That's what it looked like. That looks like I don't have any

100
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:23,130
teeth. I think I got booted from the lobby. Sorry, guys. This looks like I have no teeth.

101
00:38:24,090 --> 00:39:01,449
Hold on. I'll show in a second. Fucking click. I swear to God I'm clicking. Oh, come on. Got it.

102
00:39:01,449 --> 00:39:42,280
Careful. Careful. Oh, shit. This music. You'll never beat me on that. I'm sorry. Jesus.

103
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:51,989
Let's get back from the dentist. Yeah, just this new procedure where they take all your teeth out.

104
00:39:52,630 --> 00:40:00,360
All of them. Yeah, I just got sick of them. You know, I just don't want them anymore.

105
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,460
I'm really into it. I'm really into soups. You know, getting gummy worms, you know.

106
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:19,099
I don't want to eat anything else. Round teeth. I'm going to do one more of these and I'm done

107
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:37,030
playing this. This was cute, though. I'm going to try to get Disney Infinity to work for tomorrow.

108
00:40:42,090 --> 00:41:00,820
I just ate four Heath bars. Is that bad? How many calories are in a Heath bar? Oh, I'm AFK.

109
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:07,289
That's my bad. Sorry, sorry. In one of these Heath bars, how many calories in a little Heath bar?

110
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:33,989
200? No, it's not. 200? Oh, come on. I'm getting distracted. Somebody just farted a lot.

111
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:50,119
It's 210? No, that's in the regular ones. I'm talking about in the small ones, the little ones.

112
00:41:50,920 --> 00:42:03,860
It does not just eat a thousand calories of candy. 120. It's definitely probably like 110, 120.

113
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:17,900
Fun sizes are usually like 100. Yeah. Fortnite Kyle and then Jerma Balls. That was fun. Thanks

114
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:26,579
for playing. All of you that downloaded the game eight to nine minutes ago. It was fun. It's cute.

115
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:45,849
I'm going to buy some clothes first. Hold on. Dabba dee ba dabba. Wow. I could be so cool looking.

116
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:51,929
Here we go. Oh, wow. Yeah. Little mustache and a clown nose. Looks pretty cool. I like it. All

117
00:43:51,929 --> 00:44:06,199
right. All right. That was fun. What should we do now for a little bit? I could do. What should I

118
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:12,389
play for like 30 minutes? I'm not playing Breath of the Wild for 20 minutes. We're going to do

119
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:25,159
that tomorrow or Sunday. Maybe I'll add tribes to the list. Turmoil would be about 20 minutes.

120
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,400
I feel like I'm going to get addicted. That person said that because I'm going to get addicted to it.

121
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,190
I'm not going to turn the stream off. All right. That was cool. That was a hamster

122
00:44:34,389 --> 00:44:47,929
play the Disney game. Disney Dreamlight Valley. All right. Let's switch to it. Not that.
