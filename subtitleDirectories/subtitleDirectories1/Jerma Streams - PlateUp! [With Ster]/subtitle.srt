1
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:09,590
I am Beck. I don't know if Ster is Beck. Can you change this? What should I make this?

2
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:17,819
Like a cooking class. Cooking class with Ster. Hey, what's your what's your title?

3
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:27,349
Because I want it to be different than yours. My title is, do you still talk to Jerma?

4
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:29,109
I get that question a lot so I just put in my title.

5
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:45,560
How about uh, how about should I just make mine Ster and I are talking?

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,560
Yeah, I think that'd be good. That'd be a good co-op title.

7
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:00,709
That's fair, right? Not bad, pretty good. Okay. And then this is played up, right?

8
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,030
Yeah, all one word apparently. One word. Yeah.

9
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,789
This has been on the whole time. I'm sorry everybody.

10
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:18,139
I am so ready to make a 2018 YouTube video. Are you? Wait up, let's go!

11
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,539
So invite, how do we, how do we, are you using a controller or a keyboard mouse?

12
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:33,400
I'd have to find a controller. I just did invite only. We don't know how to even play. Oh, hold on.

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,159
How do I like add, hold on, multiplayer. Oh, invite friends.

14
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,710
There's a Twitch integration and options where the customers are chatters, I think.

15
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:55,419
Uh, options, advanced, Twitch integration. Open Chef application which handles

16
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,259
Twitch integration, Twitch settings can be configured within Chef.

17
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:07,849
I don't know if you want to deal with that. Uh, this is asking a lot right now.

18
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,330
It is, it is asking a lot more than I thought it was.

19
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,330
Yeah, it's like, I got to like, okay, this is like, I have like a new window.

20
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,729
It's like a whole nother application. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,219
I haven't, guys, I haven't even played the game.

22
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:25,060
I don't know what my Twitch password is.

23
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,979
There's a lot of stuff, I don't know.

24
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,539
Well, maybe, maybe at some point later. We have to like figure out how to play,

25
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,479
join each other's games. Can you join off me?

26
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,099
Um. Let me see if I can just invite you.

27
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:46,039
I mean, are you hosting a game?

28
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,199
I am right now, but it says like, oh, invite only.

29
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:56,710
And it says invite friends. When I click it, nothing happens.

30
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,150
Are you even online on Steam?

31
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,710
Yeah.

32
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:05,780
Uh, your name is probably like Pancake Recipe or some shit.

33
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,340
It's, it's.

34
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,379
I got it, I got it, I got it.

35
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,379
It's German.

36
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,569
What?

37
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:11,129
It is.

38
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:16,779
But wasn't your name like Ice Cream Sandwich in the last game?

39
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,060
I mean, it was, maybe.

40
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,209
Wait, were you, were you paying someone to play that game with me?

41
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,689
And you were just reacting on camera?

42
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,899
It's just, it's the new meta.

43
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:32,579
All right, can you join the game or not?

44
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:36,339
I, I don't think I can. I don't see a like join.

45
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,129
How do we do this?

46
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,500
Because I can't, when I click invite, maybe I should do this.

47
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,019
Okay. Wait, no, I'm in the tutorial.

48
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,579
Oh goodness. Do the tutorial.

49
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,490
Okay.

50
00:04:50,490 --> 00:05:15,529
That's a problem. God, what have I done?

51
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,009
Oh my God, I just exited this tutorial.

52
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:20,939
Shit. Um, okay, hold on.

53
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,589
Why can I not invite you?

54
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:30,439
Is my, okay, you make the game because my Steam overlay like is disabled.

55
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,879
Do I have to do the tutorial?

56
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,779
Because it has like a.

57
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,540
Try, try making an invite only.

58
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,459
Go to multiplayer, go to invite only and invite friends.

59
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:43,269
Because I don't, I think I do my, my Steam is off.

60
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:43,829
What?

61
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:46,360
Like my Steam integration is like fucked up.

62
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,680
I can't, when I click invite friends and nothing happens.

63
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,870
Okay. This is also going to need a controller because the interact key is P.

64
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,389
I am using a controller.

65
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,259
Oh, hold on. I'm going to find a controller real quick.

66
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,220
Oh, no.

67
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,019
We could have just, I was enjoying Ember.

68
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,370
I'm sorry that you played it for like four hours with me and didn't enjoy it for a moment.

69
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,019
I did.

70
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:18,600
We invite only was broken for me.

71
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,480
Try something else.

72
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,120
Really? For real?

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:36,699
Okay. Can you join off me now?

74
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,860
I can look, I was looking for a controller.

75
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:49,779
So this is broken. Somebody said in chat.

76
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,459
Oh, you can just leave the tutorial.

77
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,420
Yeah. That's what I did.

78
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,060
But that means we're not going to know how to play the game.

79
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,569
Yeah, we will.

80
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:01,670
Okay. I have it set to private.

81
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,790
So I wonder if you can just join me.

82
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:09,459
I'm trying.

83
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,040
There's a built-in invite.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,120
Yeah. I'm trying to do it.

85
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,920
I did what you did.

86
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,959
I couldn't get out of that.

87
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
I did quit game.

88
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,560
Calm down.

89
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,759
There was nothing else to do.

90
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,720
Okay. Just relax.

91
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm relaxed.

92
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,540
Maybe do that.

93
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,759
I'm relaxed.

94
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,399
Go into your menu, but go and just like see if you can join off of me from your Steam.

95
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,699
It's okay.

96
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,740
Multiplayer.

97
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,779
Multiplayer.

98
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:41,540
And just see if you can just join my game.

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,100
No, there's only like, hold on.

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,699
Well, you broke it.

101
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:50,259
I broke it.

102
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:52,740
I can't even right click your name on Steam right now.

103
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,939
Something's wrong.

104
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:54,420
What's today?

105
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,339
What's today?

106
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:56,980
Maintenance?

107
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,209
It's Monday.

108
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,649
My whole Steam friends list.

109
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,089
I can't click any of it.

110
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:10,100
Restart your computer.

111
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,199
I'm not doing that.

112
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,439
You need to invite through the plate up options.

113
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,980
The Steam overlay does not work.

114
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,110
Yeah, I'm in the plate up options.

115
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,829
Multiplayer and invite friends doesn't work.

116
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:24,629
I can't click it.

117
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,329
When I click it, it just goes, yeah, I'll show you.

118
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:35,740
I'll show you my black screen.

119
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,820
I don't know, just in case it's like a lobby code or something.

120
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,210
I don't know.

121
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,210
Yeah, I sent an invite to you.

122
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,769
You did.

123
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:47,990
I believe I did.

124
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,629
Did you?

125
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,399
You did.

126
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,600
Okay, play game.

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,179
All right.

128
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,779
Do you have it on private?

129
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,960
I think so.

130
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Okay.

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,639
Am I in your game?

132
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,120
Joining.

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,610
Yeah, you've joined.

134
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:03,929
All right.

135
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:04,570
All right.

136
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,610
Now, everybody.

137
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,330
Hold on.

138
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,350
I have to capture the video feed.

139
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:26,970
Okay, so should we do the tutorial?

140
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,250
Yeah, the buttons for this game.

141
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,370
I couldn't find a controller and the buttons seem insane.

142
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,419
Oh, do you want to play the tutorial?

143
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:36,899
Yes.

144
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:44,500
Let's grab while looking at the fish to take the fish.

145
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,059
Place the fish.

146
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,419
Stop touching things.

147
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:58,580
Well, place the fish on the hob to start cooking.

148
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,629
Oh, combine the fish with the plate.

149
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:11,399
Once a customer has arrived and chosen their meal,

150
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,759
interact to take their order.

151
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,070
Okay, so there's no customer.

152
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,669
You can now see their order above their head.

153
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:22,789
Place it on their table.

154
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,419
They want a blank plate.

155
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:29,379
Oh, why wasn't it looking?

156
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,299
Yeah, I looked at it that way too.

157
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,259
I just want a plate.

158
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:35,240
Yeah, like I'm not hungry.

159
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,159
Customers won't sit at the table with something on it.

160
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,000
Once they leave, grab the dirty plate.

161
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,700
Put it in the sink.

162
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,090
I had a question before we continue any further.

163
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,419
So when you're streaming and you go to the bathroom,

164
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:54,100
are you not trying to finish the bathroom as quickly as possible

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,539
or like are you in your sanctuary

166
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,620
and you're like on your phone watching a stream

167
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,419
while your stream is live waiting for you to come back?

168
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,620
Well, here's the thing.

169
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,340
I have never taken a shit in the middle of a stream ever.

170
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,179
Not one time the entire time I've ever been on Twitch.

171
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,419
So you would just end the stream before you would do that?

172
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,850
Yes, I would either go to the bathroom before or after.

173
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,049
I would never do it during a stream

174
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:24,389
because it would take way too long.

175
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:25,029
And plus, I don't know.

176
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:30,779
Look, when you're sitting there and you're taking a shit,

177
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,179
isn't it in your mind you're just thinking

178
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,500
about all the people that are leaving your stream?

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,220
It's like, dude, it's been like 10 minutes.

180
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,100
Where is this guy?

181
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,820
I'm out of here.

182
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,620
And I'm just sitting there.

183
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,379
I'd be kind of panicking.

184
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,379
Yeah, but it's got to happen sometimes.

185
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:48,340
It's never happened.

186
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,070
People always ask why I'm late

187
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,190
or why streams start so late or, oh, dude, you said two,

188
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,669
but then you said three because I need to make sure

189
00:11:57,669 --> 00:12:02,149
that all liquids and solids are out of my body completely

190
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,129
before I turn the stream on.

191
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,850
Empty, zero, empty, empty, empty.

192
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,519
That's a rough life.

193
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,399
Wow, why?

194
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,440
Because I don't want to have to do that

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
in the middle of the stream?

196
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,259
Like everybody else in their jobs,

197
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,860
they get to go to the bathroom.

198
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,580
It's not like you're allowed to go to the bathroom.

199
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,019
But I know how my bathroom habits are.

200
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:29,620
And even if I hurry, it will be 15 to 20 minutes.

201
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,980
How do I cut?

202
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:42,789
Oh, fries.

203
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:47,700
Do you chug coffee like beforehand?

204
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,169
Yes, I drink coffee all the time.

205
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,299
Get him his fries.

206
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,539
He wants fish and fries.

207
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:07,590
I got a heart.

208
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,840
Place a plate in a sink.

209
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,399
Oh, I can't.

210
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,960
Why not?

211
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Oh, we have to wash the dish and then get it out.

212
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:24,620
These sound effects are kind of loud and annoying for me.

213
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,779
Are they for you?

214
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:26,419
A little bit.

215
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,620
You can, there's always like a,

216
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,220
you know, you can lower the volume or.

217
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah, let me do that.

218
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,679
Groups expect all their meals to arrive together.

219
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,120
When they're ready, take their order.

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,809
You got it.

221
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:43,929
Oh, you got it.

222
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:50,059
Oh, I wonder what they're going to want.

223
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,580
A fish or a French fry?

224
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,149
Oh, you baste.

225
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Oh, wait, you didn't want fries.

226
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:12,120
Why, these are on the house.

227
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,679
Survive as many days as possible.

228
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:20,120
Okay, that's pretty, that's pretty hardcore.

229
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,059
If a patient's bar runs up.

230
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,419
Okay, we know what to do.

231
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:26,860
Why are you minus twoing me?

232
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,179
We can't get one bad review on Yelp.

233
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:34,600
And you should be striving for that as a business.

234
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,759
What would you guys rate my stream?

235
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,190
Oh, let's get a poll up between one and five.

236
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,549
You made a bad joke.

237
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,350
I didn't make a joke.

238
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,629
I just said a word.

239
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:59,320
I said one word.

240
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
All right, take this order.

241
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:06,950
And that's somebody's to sit there with a cooked fish.

242
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,029
It's like, so what are you going to order tonight?

243
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:10,360
Like, I don't know.

244
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
I was thinking about the soup.

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,360
Oh, the soup, huh?

246
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,500
What about this thing?

247
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,970
You think this looks good?

248
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,419
Okay, so we need to take a portion of mashed potatoes.

249
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:36,600
Oh, we can buy stuff too.

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,039
How many days do we make it?

251
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:41,740
I think we make it to day two.

252
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,250
Five.

253
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,129
Okay, cool.

254
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,950
Five.

255
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,070
What's the name of a restaurant?

256
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,289
Oil and Char.

257
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,529
Oil and that sounds disgusting.

258
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:12,340
How do we start?

259
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,909
Complete the plan to begin.

260
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,590
Okay, so we need to go to the city.

261
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,350
Oh.

262
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,470
Put the floor plan there.

263
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,929
Okay.

264
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,409
And then the menu is steak.

265
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,139
We have steak.

266
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:27,740
Okay, add oil and char.

267
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,779
Oil and char.

268
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:35,129
I think you have to get over here.

269
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:41,110
Yeah, I don't know if we're getting day two.

270
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,149
I think we get to day three.

271
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:49,289
Cook steak once for rare, twice for medium, and three times for well done.

272
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,710
What is happening?

273
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,230
Why are we losing progress?

274
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,769
All right, here we go.

275
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,169
Okay, we need rolls, rolls.

276
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:04,680
Behind the counter, start cooking a steak.

277
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,319
I'll take the orders.

278
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,119
You take the orders.

279
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,160
I will take the orders.

280
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,279
You start the food.

281
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,559
Don't move the fridge.

282
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,200
I just start day.

283
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,240
We press K.

284
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,099
Okay, are we ready?

285
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,819
It's why?

286
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,019
I thought you had a controller.

287
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,220
No, I don't.

288
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,680
That's tough times, dude.

289
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Okay.

290
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,089
Are you ready?

291
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,970
I'm ready.

292
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,490
But the name of the restaurant is High Steaks.

293
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,079
The first level.

294
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,160
It's going to be like three people are going to come in.

295
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,519
All right, so why am I taking orders?

296
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,319
They're going to want a steak.

297
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,680
That's it.

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,170
Okay, what would you like?

299
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,210
I would like a steak.

300
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,009
Oh, I wonder.

301
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:40,250
Okay.

302
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,519
What do you want to done this?

303
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,119
Okay, that's what they want.

304
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,680
They want it like that.

305
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,319
Take it off.

306
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:48,759
Get it.

307
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,480
Go, go, go, go.

308
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:51,750
You are.

309
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,579
Hey, you can't stand the heat

310
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:55,700
and you better stay out of the kitchen.

311
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,339
Clean that up.

312
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:58,180
I told you this is going to be so easy.

313
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,099
Clean that up, you little baby busboy.

314
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,569
Yeah, you got to earn a position.

315
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:09,210
How much water did you just knock on the floor?

316
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:09,609
I didn't.

317
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,450
All right, what do you want?

318
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,250
Let me guess.

319
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,289
Oh, they want a...

320
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:14,250
I think that's well done.

321
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:16,170
You already have one halfway there.

322
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,009
Wait, what is this?

323
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,559
Oh, that's just a bonus one.

324
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,599
Here, I got them.

325
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,400
How do you clean?

326
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,349
Oh, okay.

327
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:34,950
You have to hold X to clean.

328
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,089
I don't see you doing anything.

329
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,009
I was...

330
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:40,890
You're going to take his order?

331
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,990
We don't even need to.

332
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,710
We know what it is.

333
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,650
Is it going to be steak?

334
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,730
It's a medium and a well done steak.

335
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,480
This one needs to go back around.

336
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,920
You can't because it's already on the plate.

337
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,420
What?

338
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:00,309
Wait, wait, wait.

339
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:00,710
Take it off.

340
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,210
Take it off.

341
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,690
Go.

342
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,250
Here you are.

343
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,130
Ah, bon appetit.

344
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,440
Steak.

345
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,579
All right, Scott wants the steak.

346
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,829
Take that one off.

347
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:20,549
Take that one off.

348
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:21,190
Take that one off.

349
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,140
This one's burnt.

350
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,819
I'm cleaning.

351
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:33,380
The plates go back in the rack.

352
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,819
You're an idiot sandwich.

353
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,339
Oh, no.

354
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:41,299
What have you done?

355
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:41,779
What are you doing?

356
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:42,579
Well, we did it.

357
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:43,140
We won.

358
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,579
What do you mean, what am I doing?

359
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:45,140
Stop it.

360
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,700
Stop.

361
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,819
Oh, disgusting.

362
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:47,460
What are you doing?

363
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:48,819
No, stop.

364
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,900
It's fucking raw, mate.

365
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,259
It's bloody fucking raw.

366
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,390
Have you ever seen Gordon Ramsay's TikTok food reviews?

367
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,980
Uh, no.

368
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:00,329
Wait, what are these?

369
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,910
What's happening?

370
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,869
We rerolled.

371
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:13,259
Upgrade a blueprint?

372
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:14,220
What the?

373
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,339
We don't have enough money.

374
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,660
We only got 28 money, so it doesn't even matter.

375
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,539
They just give you one?

376
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,779
Wait, what are these little, these bouncing?

377
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,309
I think these are upgrades.

378
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,440
Okay, I understand.

379
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
Then you like interact, hold up.

380
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,849
That one's like hidden.

381
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:38,329
Oh, we can rearrange our kitchen even.

382
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,299
What is it?

383
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,660
Oh, okay, I see.

384
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,069
So what do we do?

385
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:48,470
Do we just pick them up and they just get stored somewhere?

386
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,910
Why don't we just put this in?

387
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,349
Why don't we just put all this shit out here?

388
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,589
You can't do that.

389
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,309
Why not?

390
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,269
I don't understand why not.

391
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:58,470
We're doing hibachi grill?

392
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,029
What's the?

393
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,309
Hibachi steak.

394
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,589
Yeah, sure.

395
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:06,309
Okay, let's rearrange.

396
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:07,910
I don't understand why we would not want to be

397
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,789
like two or three steps closer to the seats.

398
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:13,750
Uh, sure, you know, you bring up a really valid point.

399
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,309
You want to make this, um, sufficient, then that's what we can do.

400
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:24,819
And the storage will just be in here.

401
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,759
Research, yes.

402
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,640
I feel like we had, we had good flow on.

403
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:33,859
What is this heat sign that is next to these tables?

404
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,900
I think it's just decreased patience.

405
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,019
I think today they don't have a lot of patience.

406
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:44,059
That's like prepare for this because people have really

407
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,259
want their food quick today.

408
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,200
And you just took a seat away from that.

409
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,069
Okay, you ready?

410
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:53,349
I wait, hold on, hold on.

411
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,230
We can buy one of these.

412
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:56,390
What's the work boots?

413
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,460
We can buy an extra sink.

414
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,500
Okay, we don't want none of this.

415
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,299
Unless you want an extra dining table for more people.

416
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,099
We can buy that.

417
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,140
Well, we're in level two.

418
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,779
It's not gonna happen.

419
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:07,180
Okay.

420
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,980
Yeah, okay, let's start.

421
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,180
Start day.

422
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,279
Yep.

423
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,119
I remember if we lose one day, we die.

424
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
They actually pull us out back and execute us.

425
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,250
Just get some food going.

426
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,500
Okay, we got one, that one and then one well.

427
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,339
Why did you take that one off?

428
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,740
Because that wait for that one to be well and then we're good.

429
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:32,329
Okay.

430
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,049
On the plate.

431
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:33,529
Let it up.

432
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,940
There it is.

433
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,900
10 bucks.

434
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Okay, clean this ship all the way in the other room.

435
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,279
That's fine.

436
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,400
All right, I will take care of this.

437
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,240
You, you, I will do this.

438
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,880
Just go and leave.

439
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,190
This is like nothing's happening yet and it's already stressful.

440
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:05,799
Behind.

441
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,900
Get that, get that off, get that off.

442
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:18,099
Wait, two more on the grill.

443
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,059
Two more on the grill.

444
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:19,859
I'm cleaning.

445
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,680
Two more on the grill.

446
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,799
Okay, wait, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

447
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,480
Let's like farm these guys.

448
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,519
What do you mean?

449
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,880
They don't need like we have plenty of time before we can take their order.

450
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,319
We don't know what they want for steaks.

451
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:31,799
Take them off.

452
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,759
We don't know what they want.

453
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,039
We don't know what they want for steaks.

454
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,799
This is two mediums.

455
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,180
You fucking donkey.

456
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,690
Get it off.

457
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:45,269
Let's go.

458
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,259
Oh my god.

459
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:48,740
Oh my god.

460
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,859
You fucking.

461
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,220
You put it on.

462
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,019
You put it on.

463
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:53,940
Just dance in front of them.

464
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,500
Dance quick.

465
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,220
Just distract them.

466
00:23:59,259 --> 00:23:59,660
Oops.

467
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:01,900
Oh my god.

468
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,420
I can't believe you got that.

469
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,920
What?

470
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,019
Yeah, we fucked up, dude.

471
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:09,450
Actually, it looked like I don't know.

472
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,490
It was milliseconds.

473
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,599
Okay, so we're good.

474
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,799
Wait, we didn't?

475
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,599
No, it's restarting that day.

476
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:20,920
All right.

477
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,680
Well, that just didn't work.

478
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,579
I was hoping it would kick us back to the beginning.

479
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,400
I did not like the kitchen set up at all, by the way.

480
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,319
Someone was outside, you donkey.

481
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,849
What do we do about that?

482
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:39,960
Like, who cares?

483
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:45,369
So do we have a seed?

484
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:49,400
I believe so.

485
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,359
There's a seed.

486
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,319
That's interesting.

487
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,920
Get me to clear the table.

488
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,279
Oh, we needed to clear the table.

489
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,000
Okay.

490
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,549
This is a rogue light.

491
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,140
Okay.

492
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,460
What?

493
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,740
Okay, that's kind of cool.

494
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,299
All right, let's go.

495
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,410
That's why I was interested in this game because it's like,

496
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:14,250
it's not like the other games like Overcooked are all like individual puzzles.

497
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,859
This one was like, they murder you.

498
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,140
But didn't we just lose?

499
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,740
How come we were able to do it again?

500
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,059
I don't know.

501
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:25,559
Okay, well, let's go.

502
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,440
It's just stakes.

503
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,720
Just don't screw it up.

504
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,859
We just have to not be idiots.

505
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:30,900
Oh, it's after three days.

506
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,779
Okay, the first three days.

507
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,099
Oh, the first three days are free.

508
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:34,339
Yeah.

509
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:34,819
Okay.

510
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,380
All right, let's go.

511
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,019
So you're ready?

512
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:36,740
Okay.

513
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,660
All right, we need to have actual roles.

514
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,690
I will be the cleaner and I'll get the plates.

515
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,490
I'll do the cleaning.

516
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,369
I'll clean up the ground.

517
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,930
You handle the meat because same thing will happen like last time.

518
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,289
I'll put one on when you scream it at me.

519
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:52,730
Okay, take the rotor.

520
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,369
Okay, with that, we need one well, one medium.

521
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:01,269
Exactly.

522
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,150
Perfect.

523
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,190
Get out of the doorway.

524
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,789
Let me deliver it.

525
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,190
Let me deliver it.

526
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,589
All right.

527
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,109
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

528
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,509
You're right.

529
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:09,750
You're right.

530
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,150
You're right.

531
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,470
You're right.

532
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,529
You're right.

533
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,130
See, now you can do this.

534
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,529
This is how you do it too.

535
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:15,849
Yes.

536
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,859
Isn't that like not fair?

537
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:19,740
We only have one sink.

538
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,700
Okay, we need two mediums.

539
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,240
Very good.

540
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,150
Two mediums.

541
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,869
Got plenty of time.

542
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:42,230
Okay, incoming.

543
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,150
We need one medium.

544
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,069
One, I don't know what that is.

545
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:47,029
One medium, one well.

546
00:26:47,589 --> 00:26:52,819
Okay, I'll wash this.

547
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:53,220
I'll wash.

548
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,940
It's going to be a second.

549
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,900
Can you entertain them?

550
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,140
Enter.

551
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:56,579
I'll wash.

552
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:56,900
I'll wash.

553
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,619
I'll wash.

554
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:06,339
Okay, one well, one medium.

555
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,569
Put it down.

556
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,880
Now we need one well, one medium again.

557
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,900
I will do the dishes here.

558
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,859
You just pick it.

559
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:19,420
You clean.

560
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,140
I mean, you cook.

561
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,660
What?

562
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,940
I'm doing everything.

563
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,740
You cook, you clean.

564
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,380
You do everything.

565
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,259
Hey, just do everything.

566
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:30,619
And I'm going to like just stand around.

567
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,589
What kind of mom's dust?

568
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:44,309
Why are you standing still?

569
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,029
What's a well done?

570
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,750
When you were just standing still.

571
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:49,589
The day's over, dude.

572
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,549
It's like four minutes before closing

573
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,869
and you're like, you could be cleaning.

574
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,380
You know that we have the auto clean

575
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,779
end of the day imaginary auto clean restaurant.

576
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,380
I actually didn't know that.

577
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,759
Can you fill up our loading bar faster?

578
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,299
Okay, we got a lot of money now.

579
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:12,250
So what we got?

580
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,529
How much do we have?

581
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,210
We got eight extra plates.

582
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,049
We don't have a lot of plates.

583
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:17,769
I like that.

584
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:18,490
That sounds great.

585
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,089
That feels like too many plates.

586
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,130
I need that many plates.

587
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,849
No, that's going to be too many.

588
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:26,250
They're going to be on the ground and scattered.

589
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,130
Watch what happens.

590
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,240
Can't place it in this corner.

591
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,160
How can we sound like you have a joint hit in your lungs?

592
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,660
I can't place it anywhere.

593
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,700
It's because I'm 40.

594
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,980
Oh, I'm pressing the wrong button.

595
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:41,299
That's our plate room.

596
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,500
A plate room?

597
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,740
You don't have a plate room?

598
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,220
Actually, that's not a bad place for it.

599
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,809
That's a huge stack.

600
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,839
I told you this is too much

601
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,859
because now we have 12 plates.

602
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,460
A research grant?

603
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,089
What is a research grant?

604
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:59,930
Let's take this and figure out what it is.

605
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,289
Upgrade a blueprint.

606
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:05,339
What does it do?

607
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,180
That's our potions, if you need any potions over here.

608
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,049
What does it actually do?

609
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,250
I don't know.

610
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,890
I think it's a research so we get better stuff later.

611
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:17,130
So presumably we can cook more than just freaking steaks

612
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,009
and we make more money.

613
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,930
We got no more money.

614
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,160
Hold to carry two items at once.

615
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,599
My ears just rang when I did that.

616
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,259
I'm not doing that again.

617
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,319
My like ears are ringing.

618
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,380
You ready?

619
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,859
I'm ready.

620
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
We've got more plates than we have chairs.

621
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,980
What idiot bought all these plates?

622
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,180
Okay, they're going to want steaks.

623
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,559
We got a medium and a raw.

624
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:56,089
Medium and raw.

625
00:29:59,019 --> 00:29:59,660
That's not correct.

626
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:07,099
What are you doing?

627
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:09,819
You actually just ruined it.

628
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,839
It's still day three.

629
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,880
That's good.

630
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,480
With the tutorial.

631
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,150
You don't have to put them on the table till they're all ready though.

632
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,710
Maybe that was actually your fault.

633
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,990
You didn't cook it right.

634
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,259
Wait, we didn't buy everything again.

635
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:36,299
You want me to do the cooking and you can do the kind of placement stuff?

636
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,890
Okay, do you think you can handle it?

637
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:39,450
What was the...

638
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,640
It's the easiest job in the restaurant.

639
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
Do you think you deserve to be the chef?

640
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,700
Yeah, let's see.

641
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,019
Go, go, go.

642
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,339
You didn't buy your plates yet.

643
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:55,380
You were so into that.

644
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:56,500
You don't need the plate.

645
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,619
You're the chef.

646
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,339
I'll be fine.

647
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,099
All right, let's go.

648
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,329
Let's show you how it's done.

649
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,839
I want you to call out L, M, H.

650
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:12,490
L is raw, M is medium, H is high.

651
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,569
I honestly don't understand what the shades are.

652
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:16,630
Low, medium, high.

653
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:18,759
M, H.

654
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,640
See?

655
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,690
So you guys are celebrating anything?

656
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,250
Is any of your birthdays today?

657
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,329
Anyone celebrating anything today?

658
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:35,450
You're going to come get the food?

659
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,849
Can you fucking let me do my job?

660
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,819
Call it out, please.

661
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,009
L, M.

662
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,049
See?

663
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:49,529
Look at that.

664
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,500
Let me do my job.

665
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,099
Oh my god, we can't open that door if someone sits there.

666
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,660
Hey, hey, hey, I need some orders.

667
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,619
Uh, L.

668
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:15,579
Is there already one there for you?

669
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:19,609
Oh no, I didn't mean to...

670
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:21,609
Sorry.

671
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:30,460
The plates are piling up, friend.

672
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,529
What do they want?

673
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:36,569
Any orders?

674
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:37,369
I haven't ordered...

675
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,849
I don't have to ask them yet.

676
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:40,970
You put them on to...

677
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,410
I can't drop this plate.

678
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:43,690
I cannot drop this plate.

679
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,130
We need more counter space.

680
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,890
We need more counter space.

681
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,789
We need more counter space.

682
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:49,670
Does anybody want this?

683
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,680
I can't put this down anywhere.

684
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,119
I cannot put this down anywhere.

685
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,200
Okay, just...

686
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,180
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

He wants the lightweight.

688
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,539
He wants the lightweight.

689
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,420
You had an opportunity...

690
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,940

We need another counter.

We need another counter.

695
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,410

755
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,659
second then I think like my engine just stops and it's kind of like a shark

756
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:50,119
that's not swimming I fucking die you know yeah you're making a joke but that

757
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:57,619
actually feel that a lot of time yeah I'm a shark that's right I'm the alpha

758
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:07,639
what do we look at a steak sauce mushrooms adds mushroom sauce as a

759
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:19,539
topping what does that minus 15% people I don't know what does that mean guys

760
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:29,550
that means less customers per day let's do that that sounds great yeah but if we

761
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,789
need to make a mushroom sauce you think we're ready yeah I'm ready I mean you're

762
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:39,150
the chef are you ready for that chef yeah all right let's get it chef press

763
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:45,369
X whatever the button is on your computer if you have to select one of

764
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:54,710
these and hit like X it's not showing me a button to press okay we got a lot of

765
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:01,130
money a lot of money rolling in very successful business add onion and water

766
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:10,550
oh my god oil and make and then put chopped mushrooms over it okay that's

767
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:17,789
like that's like two ingredients water onion and then oh my god we have no

768
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:22,349
space I think before the day starts we can enter practice mode so you can make

769
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:26,289
one first we because now now we're in like yeah we're in like the lose the

770
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:34,710
game territory yes now we got pots we have mushrooms this onions this is where

771
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,829
do we want these I'm gonna put the pots down by the plates I feel like that

772
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:47,760
makes sense we can move we can run faster all right let's do practice as

773
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,250
the I don't I'm not confident wait was there a run faster one it's 60 bucks but

774
00:42:52,250 --> 00:43:02,519
you we can move faster a hundred percent doing that oh wow you do run faster all

775
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:16,960
right let's we need to try this okay okay so we need a pot by the cats coming

776
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:26,460
in it doesn't like cats okay so boil the pot of water put it in onion well they

777
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,539
don't want it but just yeah just figure out how to make it but there's onions

778
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:42,639
that goes in the pot this water is not boiling how do we put the onions in how

779
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:51,099
we put like the ingredients in don't chop them but you don't chop no chop oh

780
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:58,760
okay so one onion onion and water makes the broth and then we take the mushroom

781
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,719
does the mushroom need to be cut up I don't think you can't even chop the

782
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:13,090
mushrooms but you already can that one's already cut okay so that this is done

783
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:18,860
and then you said this one's cut already so do we add this so we now that a

784
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:27,360
chopped mushroom goes in and then that makes that and now we have this and we

785
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:34,800
can put it on a plate okay so if somebody wants a steak with that

786
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,760
mushroom sauce we just have to go up to it and press like the action button here

787
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:48,360
try that there's no steak I think you got to put that on top of the steak okay

788
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,880
so then go and get the sauce on it okay okay here's what we do then here's the

789
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:57,639
play right as soon as the day starts or even if it lets you do it before it we

790
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:01,920
prep the soup we prep we should just leave that on the side we should prep

791
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,760
two of them have just a bunch of it I don't think we have enough counters to

792
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,920
prep to otherwise like we're gonna be we're gonna be able to put plates

793
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,449
anywhere I agree okay yeah so let's make let's make a broth in the morning and

794
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:18,949
then after the broth is made then we open the store okay yeah that sounds

795
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:28,659
good I agree with that do you need help making the broth I think I I think I got

796
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:37,300
it okay ready hold on well let me let me start making it like I'm not sure of

797
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,940
starting the day oh we have to start the day first yeah so you got everything in

798
00:45:42,940 --> 00:46:08,860
your brain ready what you need to do yes chef yep mushroom how long until they

799
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:16,199
get annoyed was the mushroom supposed to be chopped yeah then this goes in we

800
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:19,860
need to the burner okay that's going in and then this is gonna be done oh I see

804
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:48,960
the timer before you can place the fucking we're good oh we're good we're

805
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,280

806
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,599
it taking the order H with sauce do these fuckers they want all this sauce

807
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:04,429

order good L with sauce and then L L with sauce L well done two M's medium

810
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:08,280
right I think that's I think that's well done I know that's well down to H to

811
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:23,360
a cheese can you grab that um grab that a G is a sauce good for more than one

812
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:31,869
day I think that was pretty clean it was good and we said what the fuck why

813
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:37,429
aren't they fighting anymore uh cuz we found that it's better to cooperate we

814
00:48:37,429 --> 00:48:43,960
found you know our flow what works for us if my server did that I wouldn't

815
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:50,900
return let's spin around it be like whoa I think that I think that I added

816
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:56,400
something to the atmosphere worth coming back for but you don't think it'd be

817
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,519
funny if like the server walked out with a big plate of food nice and hot and did

818
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,920
a I'm gonna pass it underneath the leg kind of like a basketball and grab it

819
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,699
with the other hand and pick it up you don't think that'd be funny chef look at

820
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:13,980
this look at this one down here this one you might want to consider here chef we

821
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,139
can afford the gas override so what does this do cooks faster burns faster I

822
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:24,409
feel like that's terrifying is that a little too scary do we even have a

823
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:29,000
garbage by the way I that's the kind of thing you do if there's four people in

824
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,570
here I don't know this is a two-person upgrade what is this filing cabinet oh

825
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:46,159
do you want another dining table I'm stuffed in the corner I don't think we

826
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,519
need we're actually maybe to make it so people won't sit outside okay and then

827
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:55,889
we'll start and remember this is like a do or die all right well let me get my

828
00:49:55,889 --> 00:50:05,789
right okay so let me get my sauce ready I'm gonna belch like a weirdo okay wait

829
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,260
it actually might be nice to have another counter yeah get it get it I

830
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:13,760
didn't see that there was a counter yeah we are starved for counter space oh

831
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:22,699
okay oh man oh geez it's really coming together is that a good place for it I

832
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:28,380

954
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,300
one of the games of the year last year then I would I mean that makes sense to

955
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:29,630
me all right we got a new menu item let's do salads a new layout mix it up a

956
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:38,170
little bit wait I think we can change clothes I did uh you know I like that I

957
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:49,059
like the the speed the high-paced environment all right I like hot dog

958
01:06:49,099 --> 01:07:00,130
we're gonna do like a maid cafe if I'm gonna be the one out there oh I can do a

959
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:13,380
pumpkin meow look what do you what do you want to eat here meow you ready I

960

961
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:36,940
optionally add up tomatoes this means can be good okay yeah I'm feeling all

962
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:47,929
right oh I like this layout you you I really can just be up out here you know

963
01:07:47,929 --> 01:08:00,809
what I'm saying let's practice salad okay okay so let it name of the

964
01:08:00,809 --> 01:08:17,770
restaurant is let us eat I just I just chopped that into tomato soup so what is

965
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:22,489
it it's chopped lettuce lettuce lettuce on a plate and that's it

966
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:34,979
optionally add yeah what lettuce one tomato okay so you can do a tomato

967
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:41,939
twice so that's it oh this is gonna be easy all right cool I like this layout a

968
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:45,699
lot this is way better than the other layout you don't got to cook anything

969
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:51,699
do you want vegan and I was chef last time and I did a phenomenal job you want

970
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:55,310
me to be the chef want to be chef this time I mean I think our roles were

971
01:08:55,310 --> 01:09:02,149
working why don't you try it it's fun but okay I mean if you okay well then

972
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:08,260
maybe I should have been the one learning how to make it I mean dude it's

973
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:12,880
literally just chop a tomato and chop lettuce put it on a plate it's not that

974
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:31,430
hard I mean it's hard when you keep covering up every fucking surface now if

975
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:35,029
you do that if you chop the tomato twice it makes tomato soup be aware of that

976
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:40,319
oh and I gotta cut I gotta chop that it's just it's just chopped okay I'm

977
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:52,479
ready that is it okay let's really okay we don't have any money so we can't do

978
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:57,479
any wait booking desk interact to accelerate time to next customer it's

979
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:08,899
like a hard mode how confident are you you want to do that um yeah let's do

980
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:19,010
that like you handle you handle the exterior I'll be in the interior I'm

981
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:23,409
gonna be ready we're gonna be feeding each other through here sounds good all

982
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:33,920
right I'm ready thank us fucking order I'm just why I thought you want a little

983
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:53,079
bit of time perfect you gotta memorize that layout I saw you move around a

984
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:57,319
little oh you're really gonna backseat that backseat me just look over the

985
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,840
counter because you have nothing to do and just tell oh you're a little bit

986
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,909
slow there buddy take their fucking order all right this person just was a

987
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:13,260
lettuce lettuce and all right we got to think of some how to describe this some

988
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:20,649
people are gonna just want lettuce okay just say lettuce an actual real salad

989
01:11:20,649 --> 01:11:25,760
that's too long to say that like this person wants lettuce I think okay well

990
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,979
today come up with what you want all right it just by default fucking order

991
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:35,939
hold on I did it's going to nighttime we won't get the money if we don't serve

992
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:41,500
them okay so when I say to mate that means the whole thing to me if I say two

993
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:46,140
orders and I say one to mate that means the tomato goes on one you understand

994
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:52,850
to mate the whole thing or what was the other one okay so we got two teammates

995
01:11:52,850 --> 01:12:15,500
that means the whole works everything tomato and lettuce just say salad no

996
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:21,340
salad okay I was focused on the task you say to mate if it's the whole with

997
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:26,260
tomatoes right and what do you say when it's not with tomatoes nothing if I say

998
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:37,000
there are two orders one to mate is this too much for you I feel like when they

999
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,920
order something and you say nothing if no sounds like I'm going to tell you the

1000
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,720
number so three customers come in and sit down right now and they order three

1001
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,079
different salads I am gonna say but later later on three customers two

1002
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:56,039
teammates later on when we're handling more than you know one type of food like

1003
01:12:56,039 --> 01:13:01,560
if we had steaks in the mix yeah you omitting the type of sat when you can't

1004
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:11,250
just say fucking salad what's your point it's gonna cause it's what I'm saying

1005
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,149
well we're not good but we're not okay do you see how many levels in a row we

1006
01:13:15,149 --> 01:13:20,260
had steaks it's gonna be like this for the least the next 40 minutes but once

1007
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:25,529
it changes you're gonna change everything okay so how about this if

1008
01:13:25,529 --> 01:13:32,810
they're if it's salad I'm gonna say salad with tomato that sucks though no

1009
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:41,500
it's we gotta do it like a diner okay I'm ready you you just say what you're

1010
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,550
gonna say and I'll try and react I'm telling you you're gonna get it and

1011
01:13:45,550 --> 01:14:05,670
you'll be like and when it's gone you're gonna miss it too one to mate yeah I

1012
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:13,750
want to mate with you two salads one to mate how's that is that better on two

1013
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:30,149
that works for me good plane salad yeah plane plane plane plane this only works

1014
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:33,909
if more than one person is sitting at a table I'm realizing that right now

1015
01:14:33,909 --> 01:14:38,229
there's a lot of issues like we there was there's nothing on the menu called

1016
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:43,270
plane based on what we just discussed for like 10 minutes to make salad

1017
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:55,390
apology with tears now just say salad yeah but what if the salad salad with

1018
01:14:55,390 --> 01:15:19,960
me yeah we can take that order just cleaning two salads one to mate two

1019
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:32,899
salads two to mate I fuck I made the soup oh you turned it into soup it's

1020
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:37,060
easy to do by accident I'm just so strong don't you dare put that down I

1021
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:48,789
have you noticed I have not you imagine your waiter hovering over your table

1022
01:15:48,789 --> 01:15:51,829
with a plate of food ready for you to eat it and just staring like waiting and

1023
01:15:51,829 --> 01:16:00,569
then waiting for you to be done yeah very cool I put on these cat ears so

1024
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:02,930
that I could be the like the one interacting with the guests by the way I

1025
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:11,229
just want to point that out and I'm stuck in the kitchen I don't think we

1026
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:18,250
need more seats I need another counter we always need a counter more buffer

1027
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:24,430
increase the movement speed and prevent spills that's all pensive can't counter

1028
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:29,819
here we go right here got a counter for you what do you want it in the corner

1029
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:40,029
this corner up here yeah okay we're good to go that's a good setup actually I'm

1030
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:48,649
curious if you can grab diagonally if you can like grab that plate do you try

1031
01:16:48,649 --> 01:16:59,720
yeah oh good yeah this is awesome okay here we go two salad two to mate well I

1032
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,079
can also like if we're in a hurry I can put stuff down you could start chopping

1033
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:29,970
it oh I can chop it from here you're right one salad to mate man this is too

1034
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:38,300
easy this is like taking money from babies they're paying for food one to

1035
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:55,180
mate salad themselves clean that plate okay come on come on come on come on one

1036
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:05,340
salad nothing on it I don't know if I could do that here I enjoy your fucking

1037
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:17,850
grass one salad one to mate ah wash the dishes because I have to walk I would

1038
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:26,189
have to walk across the whole thing I got customers out here they complaining

1039
01:18:26,189 --> 01:18:30,510
one salad one to mate still waiting for it it's hard to make these there's like

1040
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:48,840
so many steps mates out we need an extra sink we actually put a sink out

1041
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,119
here you actually should put that sink out here that makes so much sense that

1042
01:18:53,119 --> 01:19:09,220
makes so much sense yeah you mean let me have that sink over oh 25% love oh you

1043
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:15,729
get it wait why would we do that yeah why show me a potato salad but why would

1044
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:22,310
we do the one on the left I don't case you're scared of making potato salad

1045
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:30,300
you're the one making it make the customers do their own dishes chop a

1046
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:36,289
potato add to water in a pot and boil we don't even have a stove oh they

1047
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:42,100
probably gave us the stove wait wait wait wait wait wait a second I need to

1048
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:46,960
like screenshot this no just go into practice I'm telling you it looks that

1049
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,680
was intimidating when I looked at it too but it's literally easy you just have to

1050
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,960
go and put it I'm putting that description on my other monitor in case

1051
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,869
I have a dumb moment I've got a little cheat sheet okay so let's go into

1052
01:19:57,869 --> 01:20:04,319
practice real quick oh we need to open all our parcels well we just got an

1053
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:13,880
oven for free yeah cuz we needed to make the salad was that eggs because I have

1054
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:20,689
to crack an egg oh dude and I'm in the kitchen all fucking alone dude oh man

1055
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:26,300
home hey how do you think I felt they need to make the sauce every day how

1056
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:33,819
about this you want me to add the olive oil how about we put the sink down in

1057
01:20:33,819 --> 01:20:40,680
that room I can wash the dishes if that's what you want me to do do you

1058
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,880
want the sink up in the corner so we can just put them right on the put yep yeah

1059
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,079
put the sink right there that's so perfect because then I can put it right

1060
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:55,170
here I can put the clean plates right here this you don't really have a whole

1061
01:20:55,170 --> 01:21:03,689
lot of room in there olive oils over there I'm gonna need the sink to add

1062
01:21:03,689 --> 01:21:12,279
water to a pot for the salad I get okay I don't I don't know if it's like the

1063
01:21:12,279 --> 01:21:15,300
thing you were making we only have to make it once I don't know let's do

1064
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,479
practice because if you pass it to me I can fill the pot and just put it back

1065
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,899
over here yeah I just want to figure out this layout on this is the olive

1066
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:36,789
Jesus Christ told you we could add this one thing to the menu okay let's do

1067
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:45,989
practice instead of you want another counter we're down here in the lower

1068
01:21:45,989 --> 01:21:51,789
right yeah absolutely always counter I think you can even have a counter out

1069
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:57,819
there for an extra dirty plate so I somebody saying you should do the olive

1070
01:21:57,819 --> 01:22:03,670
oil I mean I should yeah like you as in me like I should do the finishing on it

1071
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:14,560
maybe well let's just practice it say here let me wait don't do it yet let me

1072
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:34,029
I can hit B it's easy I'm stressed okay let's go ready practice okay this plate

1073
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:49,659
up chop potato add water water this up germa germa drink germa germa my drink

1074
01:22:49,659 --> 01:23:00,060
right there they want okay we want whoever that is then you boil that

1075
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,699
what's your next step this is crack egg and add olive oil so I think you need to

1076
01:23:04,699 --> 01:23:11,039
put olive oil in that egg okay I think I just did okay then yeah then the

1077
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:22,420
potatoes are ready to go combine all three out of plate oh my god I got to

1078
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:28,579
boil the potatoes every fucking Jesus every time rice interesting okay and then

1079
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:37,430
yes let me to make salad if I put the pot there it needs water I thought you're

1080
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:42,260
gonna put I thought you're gonna do tomato I'm just because it's practice I

1081
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:46,340
don't think that's done by the way that doesn't look like the thing the cat

1082
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:53,590
wants is it missing something it looks like a different picture doesn't it

1083
01:23:53,590 --> 01:24:01,810
yeah okay let me let me go through this one by one chop a potato oh you're

1084
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:13,989
missing the onion add to water in a pot crack an egg olive oil with the egg chop

1085
01:24:13,989 --> 01:24:25,079
onions I didn't skip the onions and then you just you just throw that on the you

1086
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:43,810
plate then I need an empty plate and I gotta like I'm not I I don't know about

1087
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:51,500
this man we got it we're gonna leave practice how about you do make it a

1088
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:56,029
couple times make it like two three times okay let's okay so in this pot

1089
01:24:56,029 --> 01:25:02,380
means I need water hot say it to go pot and when you need oil just say like

1090
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:12,250
like grease oil egg oil egg oil egg that's too many syllables grease is one

1091
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:31,850
and then water what I'm missing the onion okay onion comes at the end I think

1092
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:36,090
I'm good I think I'm good are you good just a lot of steps try it one more time

1093
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:43,539
just say oil oil is two syllables no grease oil oil is two syllables this

1094
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:51,539

1153
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:57,050
you even come a foot in this kitchen I see okay it's not as bad as I thought

1154
01:32:57,050 --> 01:33:01,649
because they all want slices so it gives us a lot of time to like prepare one and

1155
01:33:01,689 --> 01:33:07,229
we can handle a few people yeah no we're good we got it okay I just think that

1156
01:33:07,229 --> 01:33:15,409
there may be like one step of this that like you could help with and what do you

1157
01:33:15,409 --> 01:33:19,729
want that to be all you said was are you put dough here and you screamed at me and

1158
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:23,090
you said why are you not kneading the dough which I didn't even know that that

1159
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:27,489
that needed um you took the screenshot remember you remember you it was on the

1160
01:33:27,489 --> 01:33:35,039
screen and you just pressed a yeah I remember here um let's see what we got

1161
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:44,899
I think just wasn't with another counter that'll be a lot easier I think that's

1162
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:49,869
all I really need and we've got like the three like the Omega counter set up your

1163
01:33:49,869 --> 01:33:55,539
plates and sink I could do plates I could do plates and sink yeah you you

1164
01:33:55,539 --> 01:33:59,340
give me the option to do something in here and I will leave your kitchen alone

1165
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:10,729
yeah cuz uh yeah you were spending a lot of time watching me and judging me so

1166
01:34:10,729 --> 01:34:13,810
yeah you put those where you want we're all just pointing and laughing at you

1167
01:34:13,810 --> 01:34:21,789
over here you're gonna wash the dishes wash dishes and then I need a spot

1168
01:34:21,829 --> 01:34:27,069
because I think about this right if I wash a dish here I need to walk in here

1169
01:34:27,069 --> 01:34:32,520
yeah give me something that you can come and grab really quick I guess you could

1170
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:48,460
you could do it there would you eat a raw pizza for a trillion dollars yes but

1171
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:54,329
I could literally change the entire earth if I had a trillion dollars like

1172
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:58,329
would even just eat a raw pizza and like shit my pants and puke for a day like a

1173
01:34:58,329 --> 01:35:03,779
trillion dollars but what is this I could solve every problem probably on

1174
01:35:03,779 --> 01:35:07,800
earth I could do so much with that I would do I just do but I just shit my

1175
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:13,960
pants once like a couple days I'll do it right now free yes but it's yucky and

1176
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:25,520
gross oh yeah right yuck all right are you good yeah so I'm gonna wash the

1177
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,609
dishes I'm gonna put them on that counter on the left or if there's an

1178
01:35:29,609 --> 01:35:32,810
open space you could even just place them on the front counters then I could

1179
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:37,130
put pizzas on them yes like just play it by ear we'll figure it out during the

1180
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:57,020
day sounds good I wonder what this person's gonna order you can take it

when does a jalapeno become like super hot they're all pretty much the same

1206
01:39:08,529 --> 01:39:11,930
you might get one with a lot of seeds but it's really not that hot jalapenos

1207

are pretty low on the scale okay I'm a pretty baby boy to be honest I'm I'm kind

1208
01:39:18,140 --> 01:39:21,939
of like a little toddler they are fresh-cut jalapenos that's why they're

1231
01:42:22,819 --> 01:42:33,720

1234
01:42:49,170 --> 01:43:00,460
I'm eating possibly already rotten pie from Christmas dude I'm I don't you

1235
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:05,859
probably shouldn't be doing that right now when Christmas is the 25th what day

1236
01:43:05,859 --> 01:43:15,760
is it is it was today the 9th I don't know if you should eat that Christmas how

1237
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:21,369
long what kind of pie is that eat that pie yeah I don't think you should eat

1238
01:43:21,369 --> 01:43:35,100
that pie this thing cleans floor messes faster rip chat member we got another

1239
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,909
table let's get that yeah that's a big deal I'm gonna put this in the corner

1240
01:43:38,909 --> 01:43:43,750
yeah we want to keep them away from the kitchen too because you'll walk slower

1241
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:48,460
if you're near him so we want them like on this on this side yeah I think that's

1242
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:58,590
not maybe this corner and then don't put them by that door trust me even we

1243
01:43:58,590 --> 01:44:03,779
have never sat more than three people okay you might have trouble getting to

1244
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:13,949
the people in the corner only one person at least two there you go two two two

1245
01:44:13,949 --> 01:44:19,460
okay wait what is that sign I thought did you write that that's the name of

1246
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:23,420
the restaurant I just saw that I just saw pussy I'm like wait why did you do

1247
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:26,340
that I'm like why did you write that why did you make the name of the

1248
01:44:26,340 --> 01:44:33,340
restaurant because I'm a cat I was like what does this say is that are we gonna

1249
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:36,859
have a problem I thought you came down here wrote like that I thought you just

1250
01:44:36,859 --> 01:44:49,670
started writing shit okay like you're um do we want more plates the plate rack

1251
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:54,789
also holds eight instead of those so they're easier to stack and that's the

1252
01:44:54,789 --> 01:45:01,220
last decision if you want an extra set of plates I think we need more counters

1253
01:45:01,220 --> 01:45:04,939
before we have more plates well then we would have to reroll the blueprints

1254
01:45:04,939 --> 01:45:17,869

1298
01:53:03,779 --> 01:53:09,260

1398
02:08:17,439 --> 02:08:21,920
like I'd be using that door oh it just deletes the door too you're forgetting

1399

why are they sitting at the dirty table that was pretty weird are you able to

1416
02:10:52,739 --> 02:10:56,899
like delete counters at a certain point like if we wanted to delete this plate

1417
02:10:56,899 --> 02:11:06,710
tray so we can get the bigger plates yeah yes yeah one star yeah yeah dude

1418
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:17,659
nice my heart messed up now racing why are you pretending isn't that this

1419
02:11:17,659 --> 02:11:32,869
chopped onion is a pizza topping let's get oh finally chopped onion and add to

1420
02:11:32,869 --> 02:11:40,890
pizza before read it was wait was it before cooking I don't know what do you

1421
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:55,789
think it sounded like you said before or before you don't even like

1422
02:11:55,789 --> 02:12:02,069
pizza you poser who doesn't like pizza oh yeah okay so I think we can buy the

1423
02:12:02,069 --> 02:12:06,350
bigger stack of plates and if we put the this stack of plates outside it deletes

1424
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:14,850
it is what I think oh yeah there's a trash out here

1425
02:12:14,850 --> 02:12:20,140
some of you guys not like pizza oh and you sell it I don't know if you get

1426
02:12:20,140 --> 02:12:24,659
money for it I feel like humans have developed these taste buds that pizza

1427
02:12:24,659 --> 02:12:28,960
just hits everything that you like and I feel like it's impossible to not enjoy

1428
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:36,609
the taste of pizza tomato sauce has that savory on the your savory taste buds

1429
02:12:36,609 --> 02:12:41,640
cheese hits you you know I mean it's I feel like it's impossible I've never

1430
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:52,439
been hit by these humans were built to enjoy pizza it's like our mouths were

1431
02:12:52,439 --> 02:13:01,079
created to like to enjoy that flavor yeah I think that's in the Bible yeah

1432
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:06,420
when when when when Jesus makes the pizza and serves it at the last day

1433
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:21,500
hey good gonna get a plate ready for you up here back I'm gonna get two plates

02:15:55,489 --> 02:16:07,159
onions no we're good thank God imagine hearing that like well I guess I guess

1455
02:16:07,159 --> 02:16:12,170
we're gonna order the cheese then I uh every once in a while I really enjoy

1456
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:20,920
watching some of like the trashiest possible reality TV and it was

1457
02:16:20,920 --> 02:16:24,239
recommended by my sister-in-law was saying that um what's the name of the

1458
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:29,460
show the rich people on yachts fucking below deck they like follow the crew of

1459
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:33,520
a yacht that need to like serve like rich pampered people and I fucking loved

1460
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:37,079
the chef because like every time someone would order something he didn't like he

1461
02:16:37,079 --> 02:16:41,989
just like stop he's fucking idiots so I'm channeling that a bit what would

1462
02:16:41,989 --> 02:16:50,620
what network is this on uh on Bravo whoo into the counter I know you like those

1463
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:56,159
I think we have enough counters unless we want to throw another like there's

1464
02:16:56,159 --> 02:17:01,620
actually no room for it could why I put it up in this corner hey rolling pin

1465
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:06,559
three times faster and rolling the dough uh it rolls really fast I don't think we

1466
02:17:06,559 --> 02:17:13,639
need that that's like the fastest part of the process okay so let me I'm gonna

1467
02:17:13,639 --> 02:17:21,909
get the extra counter we're gonna put it I let me do my thing here darling I'm

1468
02:17:21,909 --> 02:17:26,510
gonna put these here as honestly like I feel like I'm running in here way too

1469
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:36,860
much is that a good spot though can I switch it yeah I can get it we need the

1470
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:43,129
research desk I have no idea what it does what does it do what do we put it

1471
02:17:43,129 --> 02:17:49,719
like what is it for it says it upgrades the thing on a cabinet next to it which

1472
02:17:49,719 --> 02:17:53,860
we put it next to I don't know I don't know I haven't noticed to do anything I

1473
02:17:53,860 --> 02:17:56,979
tried to use it last game when I put it next to the cheese but I guess that's

1474
02:17:56,979 --> 02:18:00,340
not a cabinet put it next to the filing cabinet saying filing cabinet filing

1475
02:18:00,340 --> 02:18:04,670
cabinet well then we'll move the cheese oh it is doing something what is it

1476
02:18:04,670 --> 02:18:12,180
doing though it researches it has to be next to a filing cabinet oh okay thanks

1477
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:16,030

1492
02:20:37,899 --> 02:20:40,940
anything do you know anything about like making pizza I know you know a lot about

1493
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:46,180
eating pizza but you know about making pizza I make pizzas now and again I

1494
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:50,540
enjoy making a nice pizza it's pretty simple you have a big paddle that you

1495
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:57,350
use they're like I think that would make it more fun the big like spatula paddle

1496
02:20:57,350 --> 02:21:01,469
yeah doesn't that just seem awesome like how powerful you'd feel using that

1497
02:21:01,510 --> 02:21:06,219
yeah you get it nice all right but hold on but we have to we have to figure this

1498
02:21:06,219 --> 02:21:09,940
out because I have a kind of a way that I like pizza you probably have a way that

1499
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:14,069
you like pizza but it's about the customers are we like we're basing this

1500
02:21:14,069 --> 02:21:17,790
around our personal taste and they come in for like the authentic germ area well

1501
02:21:17,790 --> 02:21:22,309
because you need to you need to you know how much you like certain pizza you know

1502
02:21:22,309 --> 02:21:25,090
how you want it to taste what's your pizza toppings what do you what do you

1503
02:21:25,090 --> 02:21:28,729
put on your pizza well I wouldn't make a deep dish pizza place I don't really

1504
02:21:28,729 --> 02:21:33,229
like it and I don't really know about it right I my pizza thin New York style

1505
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:40,459
crust super crispy not a whole lot of grease super super crunchy that's the

1506
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:45,850
kind of my favorite pizza super thin what's going on it I mean honestly be

1507
02:21:45,850 --> 02:21:52,579
the not just cheese or pepperoni and I'm talking like you get this shit so thin

1508
02:21:52,579 --> 02:21:57,459
that those places where they throw it into the oven and it's in there for 60

1509
02:21:57,459 --> 02:22:01,819
seconds like so thin and so crispy you could cut someone's throat with it I

1510
02:22:01,819 --> 02:22:09,690
don't know why that's where you're going with this but I mean no so a little bit

1511
02:22:09,690 --> 02:22:14,969
a little bit of give but right okay you're not not them okay let me do let

1512
02:22:14,969 --> 02:22:18,649
me show you like you know I'm talking about when you do that like you bite

1513
02:22:18,649 --> 02:22:22,989
and then you bite bite you know I mean yeah yeah yeah you first bite you bite

1514
02:22:22,989 --> 02:22:27,840
bite bite that's my favorite kind of pizza have you never had deep dish or

1515
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:32,799
like I've had it's just a lasagna you don't like it it's a it's a lasagna it's

1516
02:22:32,799 --> 02:22:37,479
a lasagna a deep dish pizza is a lasagna to me I don't think that there's like

1517
02:22:37,479 --> 02:22:42,540
bread in a lasagna but it's just like a bunch of sauce it's a lasagna there's a

1518
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:46,059
bunch of cheese tons of cheese tons of sauce it's like thick it's like I could

1519
02:22:46,059 --> 02:22:52,850
eat it with a fork and knives little Zion okay I did I I don't dislike it a

1520
02:22:52,850 --> 02:23:00,459
deep dish pizza tastes really great I just don't it's more growing up in the

1521
02:23:00,459 --> 02:23:05,979
90s my family really wanted to believe that they were Italian because the

1522
02:23:05,979 --> 02:23:11,559
Sopranos was very popular so they would get Sicilian pies pretty often that's

1523
02:23:11,799 --> 02:23:17,639
it is but that is like a that's basically deep dish mmm that's not like

1524
02:23:17,639 --> 02:23:23,780
deep dish Chicago style that Sicilian kind of you talk about like the square

1525
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:30,860
slices right yeah that's not deep dish that literally is like deep dish how is

1526
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:36,879
it not it's just it's just like a better it's just better but it's deep dish well

1527
02:23:36,879 --> 02:23:44,719
deep yeah Sicilian is that's not it's not no it's not see I don't know cuz I

1528
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:49,329
only like we weren't actually Italian there's a lot of different kinds of

1529
02:23:49,329 --> 02:23:53,610
pizza that you think oh that's that's pizzas all the same there's like a

1530
02:23:53,610 --> 02:23:58,959
dozen at least versions of different pizza there's like Chicago style Detroit

1531
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:07,260
style there's our own style we go like drama style and like we franchise it and

1532
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:11,219
everyone would know like I don't like Chicago I like the German rumble pizza

1533
02:24:11,219 --> 02:24:16,139
whatever you would call it so you want us to be like a kid's restaurant no like

1534
02:24:16,139 --> 02:24:19,940
we could come up with like a whole new and there's whipped cream and there's

1535
02:24:19,940 --> 02:24:26,059
there's anchovies and there's the bake style there's got to be like an

1536
02:24:26,059 --> 02:24:30,979
undiscovered bake style I don't I don't think so I think it's I mean maybe this

1537
02:24:30,979 --> 02:24:34,219
is like a new twist but I don't know anything about baking food well that's

1538
02:24:34,219 --> 02:24:38,540
why we got the research desk going on up here all right but to answer the

1539
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:42,780
question so I what is is your is like that Sicilian like or Detroit style is

1540
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:48,329
that what you like I mean I think I only would like it if I was near like an

1541
02:24:48,329 --> 02:24:52,170
authentic place that was like we make Sicilian pies we do it good so what if

1542
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:56,010
otherwise like I'm out here in Texas like everything is a chain restaurant

1543
02:24:56,010 --> 02:25:00,790
there's no real food it was all made like a year ago so I'll make the thin

1544
02:25:00,790 --> 02:25:05,149
crust kind of Connecticut or New York kind of style pizza and you do the like

1545
02:25:05,149 --> 02:25:07,149
Detroit style we have two different ovens we'll just have two we'll just

1546
02:25:07,149 --> 02:25:11,069
compete with each other yeah the competing ovens and you come in you

1547
02:25:11,069 --> 02:25:15,780
got to like put a ballot in we'll just be the Twix brothers but we're in the

1548
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:18,940
same restaurant so okay so imagine this you walk into the restaurant and it's

1549
02:25:18,940 --> 02:25:23,329
kind of like I'll describe it as a hallway on the left is your pizzeria on

1550
02:25:23,329 --> 02:25:27,940
the right is my pizzeria and like we're shouting at each other across like but

1551
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,739
you can come up to order from me or him and like if you if someone comes up to

1552
02:25:30,739 --> 02:25:36,780
order you know and I try and like haggle them like I'll give you five dollars one

1553
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:41,299
piece I don't know prices no what I went out fighting over who gets more I'm just

1554
02:25:41,299 --> 02:25:44,579
saying we could have no I think it would be a really cool environment to like sit

1555
02:25:44,579 --> 02:25:48,700
in the middle of like two arguing people trying to make better pizzas and serve

1556
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:52,489
you better yeah but what if somebody comes in and they want from one side one

1557
02:25:52,489 --> 02:25:56,729
pie from the other side and like we're getting all upset about it but I'm

1558
02:25:56,729 --> 02:26:01,049
never gonna argue to somebody that comes in wanting a Detroit style pizza to eat

1559
02:26:01,049 --> 02:26:04,700
a New York or Connecticut style pizza that they've already come in and they

1560
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:09,000
already know what they want so they're gonna go to you okay but you could try

1561
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:16,409
and convince them that they're wrong why would you oh hey I love Detroit style

1562
02:26:16,409 --> 02:26:19,969
pizza oh this place does Detroit style pizza I'm going in there that sounds

1563
02:26:19,969 --> 02:26:23,969
great new place what's it good on Yelp oh like 4.3 I'll try it and then they

1564
02:26:23,969 --> 02:26:28,739
walk in and I go Connecticut style peaches better eat mine you don't want

1565
02:26:28,739 --> 02:26:31,819
his pieces he's got the cockroaches in his pieces you want my pizzas they're

1566
02:26:31,819 --> 02:26:34,260
just not gonna this is gonna be this thing like a dickhead they're gonna be

1567
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:40,049
like that guy's an asshole 4.3 on Yelp omega low that's good of the

1568
02:26:40,049 --> 02:26:46,069
environment that's just the environment people are omega low in 4.3 on Yelp bro

1569
02:26:46,069 --> 02:26:55,239
that's a high high score on Yelp okay the woman it sounds like you're not in

1570
02:26:55,239 --> 02:26:59,659
on this I mean what you you want to like do a stream where we make pizzas and

1571
02:26:59,659 --> 02:27:03,420
compete and rent out space in like New York City is this what you want to do

1572
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:09,840
didn't we actually like 20 years ago say it would be like funny to take like

1573
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:15,370
cooking classes yeah that was this was like a thing it was that was immediately

1574
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:20,389
dropped it was like totally not ever gonna happen I mean it sounds kind of

1575
02:27:20,389 --> 02:27:25,850
fun yeah maybe we have a lot of the hallway

1576
02:27:25,850 --> 02:27:39,149
pizzeria I would call it the pizza gauntlet you have to sign a waiver

1577
02:27:39,149 --> 02:27:45,860
before you come in because we can get rough let's just save our money man but

1578
02:27:45,860 --> 02:27:49,780
like I'm fucking frisbee-ing the pan the pizza goes on at each other what are

1579
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:54,700
you talking about I don't know like there could be I don't know like

1580
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:59,059
anything could happen it's just like you frisbee it at me and it's just perfect

1581
02:27:59,059 --> 02:28:03,909
spiral that big pizza pan just hits me right in the forehead and if it's

1582
02:28:03,909 --> 02:28:09,989
crispy enough again you could really break the skin as is in your

1583
02:28:09,989 --> 02:28:14,579
grandmother's pizza shop so essentially you just want to you just want to make

1584
02:28:14,579 --> 02:28:18,100
a mess for a few hours is what you want to do I think I don't think it has to be

1585
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:21,379
a mess I just think the end I like you know how you okay imagine this you're

1586
02:28:21,379 --> 02:28:24,500
growing out to eat you're going to a nice restaurant you're with your family

1587
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:29,500
and like the waiter comes over like everything's nice and proper where can

1588
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:36,399
you go to just like eat but also get totally fucked up and just to be like

1589
02:28:36,399 --> 02:28:41,239
scared and like a little bit on edge and like looking around but it's like a

1590
02:28:41,239 --> 02:28:45,420
it's like fun it's like you're not actually gonna get jumped like it's the

1591
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:49,860
other people that are like people are saying Ross Waffle House how many how

1592
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:53,700
many people watch like people arguing on tik-tok or like these like YouTube like

1593
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:57,620
all this guy was like freaking out and the Kentucky Fried Chicken that's crazy

1594
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:01,100
like you would be like that every day but it would just be us doing it so it's

1595
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:04,899
like but you want like like medieval time like a medieval times restaurant

1596
02:29:04,899 --> 02:29:10,469
like with actors or do you what do you mean I mean in a sense I guess we are

1597
02:29:10,469 --> 02:29:15,379
acting through the competition of our pies so you're talking about like hey

1598
02:29:15,379 --> 02:29:20,620
when you come in here and sit down we're actively trying to hurt each other

1599
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:23,420
we you and I are actively trying to hurt each other and people are like in here

1600
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:31,110
it's like wrestling like WWF competition pies and like we're putting on like a

1601
02:29:31,110 --> 02:29:36,440
show like some people like is this real I was cool you know and like we're gonna

1602
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:41,299
be making their food but also it's like fighting each other we don't have to

1603
02:29:41,299 --> 02:29:44,579
like physically fight but we're definitely gonna be in verbal arguments

1604
02:29:44,579 --> 02:29:48,459
there could be things being thrown so I send out like this guy like you know

1605
02:29:48,459 --> 02:29:52,059
like Louie comes out to like to like go fight you or something he's got like a

1606
02:29:52,059 --> 02:29:56,340
yeah and then I send out my goon and he's like fucking Louie or something and

1607
02:29:56,340 --> 02:30:04,500
then they just like brawl PVP pizza restaurant yeah kinda it's like a

1608
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:09,180
theater it's like food and a show like every day at 630 we do the same bit

1609
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:13,000
we're like we've practiced this for years where we like toss pies across the

1610
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,340
room and like you catch it and throw it back and it's spinning and I catch and I

1611
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,940
twirl and I put it down on the you know and I start cooking you know what I'm

1612
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:22,459
saying but you if you're doing Detroit style pizza if I throw my dough over

1613
02:30:22,459 --> 02:30:26,579
there it's gonna ruin your entire thing eventually it comes back to you and then

1614
02:30:26,579 --> 02:30:31,579
like pizza it's the combo pizza we do one combo pizza a day 630 it's a whole

1615
02:30:31,579 --> 02:30:36,020
bit and like it's the best pie you got to get you got to be there at 6 and I

1616
02:30:36,020 --> 02:30:38,659

1617
02:30:38,659 --> 02:30:42,899

1619
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:51,899
like it like like a cake and to be clear I'm not doing Detroit style I'm not like

1620
02:30:51,899 --> 02:30:55,420
Connecticut whatever you're I'm doing cat style I'm doing the fucking whole

1621
02:30:55,420 --> 02:31:03,899
cat like made-outfit cafe type style of pizza yeah it's gonna be like you know

1622
02:31:03,899 --> 02:31:20,540
my own little twist all right I'm just imagining doing that to me and I'm like

1623
02:31:20,540 --> 02:31:25,579
look like pizza sauce all of my face and like it does like five to ten cuts in

1624
02:31:25,700 --> 02:31:29,059

1625
02:31:29,059 --> 02:31:32,579
looking around like oh my god and that's really really intense music is being

1650
02:33:41,719 --> 02:33:52,309
See I was up here. I wouldn't even sit in the chair anymore. I was just up here sitting in like a sofa

02:33:52,829 --> 02:33:54,829
Let's take this one shark tank

1652
02:33:54,829 --> 02:34:01,500
See I was up here. I wouldn't even sit in the chair anymore. I was just up here sitting in like a sofa

1653
02:34:01,500 --> 02:34:03,500
I was just up here sitting in like a sofa

1654
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:08,780
Let's take this one shark tank

1655
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:16,530
Stop pretending

1656
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:25,239
All right, we're doing sad. This is my turn to cook your turn to cook. Okay. We're doing well like things are actually gonna get played it

1657
02:34:25,239 --> 02:34:32,700
I hope you can handle, but I hope you can handle the incredibly difficult put lettuce on a plate dish

1658
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:37,700
You're gonna be serving up you pick the hard one. Why do you I that's not my fault

1659
02:34:37,700 --> 02:34:44,139
The pizzas were coming out the pizzas were out, but then you were talking about a funny scenario

1660
02:34:44,139 --> 02:34:53,020
I'm sorry. I'll be less entertaining this one the name of the restaurant. Let us entertain you that's gonna have to change

1661
02:34:53,020 --> 02:35:13,299
Are we ready?

1662
02:35:13,299 --> 02:35:15,979
Ready for

1663
02:35:15,979 --> 02:35:26,200
Ready for service. I'm ready. I know what to do. I know what I'm doing. Okay, can you make a salad?

1664
02:35:26,200 --> 02:35:32,280
All right, so how do you want to communicate this?

1665
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:37,579
I'll say one salad and I'll say tomato when it needs tomato

1666
02:35:37,579 --> 02:35:42,079
You really are the voices guy today. It's not me tomato tomato

1667
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:48,079
Tomato tomato tomato tomato. I need a tomato. Oh, it looks like a long walk to get those tomatoes

1668
02:35:48,079 --> 02:35:51,079
Yeah, you hold on. I think you

1669
02:35:51,079 --> 02:35:57,940
Enjoy your tomato, sir. The most disgusting vegetable. I'm telling you

1670
02:35:58,940 --> 02:36:01,500
Wait, you don't like tomato. Neither do I

1671
02:36:01,500 --> 02:36:03,739
If you put tomatoes on a fucking sandwich

1672
02:36:03,739 --> 02:36:06,500
Why?

1673
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:13,500
Can we get some grass grass? Thank you. You and I finally completely agree on something

1674
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:16,500
I mean like a hundred percent agree completely

1675
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:21,280
Finally after all these years we've agreed on one thing

1676
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:24,459
Today I'm not a big fan of tomatoes on very much

1677
02:36:24,459 --> 02:36:27,459
It has no taste and it's just mushy water

1678
02:36:27,459 --> 02:36:32,459
Tomatoes are amazing on some things, but not honest. I don't really like it. Why you what do you why did you do that?

1679
02:36:32,459 --> 02:36:34,459
We need one tomato

1680
02:36:34,459 --> 02:36:36,459
sabotaging

1681
02:36:36,459 --> 02:36:40,950
And is this my fault or yours? You're gonna blame me for this?

1682
02:36:40,950 --> 02:36:42,950
Gonna need one tomato one salad

1683
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:45,579
It would have been done already

1684
02:36:46,579 --> 02:36:50,079
Excuse me. Sorry. Our chef's a fucking imbecile. You'd have your food. It's not hard

1685
02:36:50,579 --> 02:36:55,430
Let me tell you if I touched you or pizza

1686
02:36:55,930 --> 02:36:58,360
You would have screamed

1687
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:02,360
You would have been like

1688
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:06,860
You would have screamed at me and I would have been like, oh shit. He's mad

1689
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:09,100
Two tomatoes

1690
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:17,649
Get out of here. I'm trying to help

1691
02:37:17,649 --> 02:37:19,649
Get out of the way

1692
02:37:19,649 --> 02:37:27,819
You just so used to being up here in the kitchen that you're like, okay

1693
02:37:27,819 --> 02:37:29,819
Now I'm gonna get up there and do everything. Oh

1694
02:37:29,819 --> 02:37:45,489
It's cuz it's slow service. You're trying to um, we need to we need to rearrange. This is a disaster. It's terrible

1695
02:37:46,489 --> 02:37:57,700
I will handle. I don't know good. Let's just like speed run

1696
02:37:57,700 --> 02:38:01,409
the starting

1697
02:38:01,409 --> 02:38:08,409
Yeah, I mean, honestly, there's one counter the first two three days are absolutely on it's impossible to lose

1698
02:38:08,409 --> 02:38:13,420
Here give me I'm gonna take the sink outside

1699
02:38:14,420 --> 02:38:22,959
Can you give me the plates I feel like I'm

1700
02:38:23,959 --> 02:38:32,379
Way too far away. Well, when my when I have clean plates, I'll just play some here for you. Okay, that makes sense

1701
02:38:32,379 --> 02:38:35,059
Yeah, let's try this. Let's try. Let's try a surface like this

1702
02:38:35,059 --> 02:38:40,620
I know people like to go out to a restaurant where like instead of watching the food being made they get to watch the like

1703
02:38:40,620 --> 02:38:45,620
The dish guy just clean the dishes right next to their table

1704
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:50,620
I think it's like a new like thing. They're doing an ally. I have a plate. Hey one tomato

1705
02:38:50,620 --> 02:39:03,020
Hey one tomato

1706
02:39:10,139 --> 02:39:14,479
One tomato

1707
02:39:14,479 --> 02:39:44,479
Man, if we could just get customers in the door, I get the best salad in New York. How's this flowing for you?

1708
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:53,790
That's not quite that's not an accolade

1709
02:39:53,790 --> 02:40:04,239
Oh, you know, I got I got the best salad in New York. I mean when you have a like a really good farm close by

1710
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:10,250
You know, it's like oh since since like 19 oh since 1903 best salad

1711
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:42,629
When I was really young I had my own very special methods of

1712
02:40:43,809 --> 02:40:46,069
cooking like

1713
02:40:46,069 --> 02:40:48,069
Eggo waffles, okay

1714
02:40:48,069 --> 02:40:52,309
All right, like, you know, like oh first you like butter it then you like put in the microwave

1715
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:56,309
Then you toast it then you put in the microwaves like it's like softer and I was like man I should like when I'm older

1716
02:40:56,309 --> 02:40:57,309
I'll be able to open my own restaurant

1717
02:40:57,309 --> 02:41:02,309
I've never seen a restaurant where someone like makes you eggo waffles and eggo waffles are fucking awesome

1718
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:09,559
Like you get like pop darts and other stuff like that. Do you like like real waffles the bait in a waffle maker?

1719
02:41:09,559 --> 02:41:16,690
Yeah, because those are you like eggo waffles. You could you know, just take the next step up

1720
02:41:17,690 --> 02:41:20,690
Well, I'm saying this was like I was really really young

1721
02:41:25,139 --> 02:41:30,139
Better than like a legitimately made Belgian waffle. I'm like making fun of your child palate

1722
02:41:30,139 --> 02:41:33,829
Man, you could have you could have like, you know, step it up a little kid

1723
02:41:36,329 --> 02:41:40,329
We were looking for a sink a counter is everything going well, we saved the money buy some big stuff later

1724
02:41:40,329 --> 02:41:46,329
I think reemptively get a counter because in case we don't see one later, you know, what do you like?

1725
02:41:46,329 --> 02:41:52,340
Yeah, I think you get another I think you get another counter in there. I like what?

1726
02:41:53,649 --> 02:42:00,889
So eggo waffles, what are the ones over there? It's four smaller little waffles. They're individual big waffles that oh, yeah

1727
02:42:00,889 --> 02:42:07,010
Yeah, what are those called? I can't remember just like minis this something though. Those are better than the regular waffles

1728
02:42:07,030 --> 02:42:10,219
There's those are better than regular eggo waffles

1729
02:42:10,219 --> 02:42:14,620
I like the the cinnamon toast eggo waffles where it's like two and they look like breads

1730
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:19,950
Haven't had those in a long while here. Do you want this?

1731
02:42:20,950 --> 02:42:36,040
Want this want this? Oh, you need a I need plates up here. I could just yeah, I don't have plates fucking disaster

1732
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:37,760
I don't have plates up here

1733
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:39,399
We need to grass

1734
02:42:39,399 --> 02:42:42,100
There it is

1735
02:42:42,139 --> 02:43:02,719
There's a door in the front, you know, but I feel like that would have taken longer

1736
02:43:04,180 --> 02:43:32,649
Not so easy, isn't it? That's pretty easy. I want to clean this. How come I can't clean this up?

1737
02:43:34,139 --> 02:43:46,540
Though I don't know. It's weird. I really do feel like the difficulty hits a point for us

1738
02:43:46,540 --> 02:43:51,469
We're like, I think we're supposed to have a third person

1739
02:43:53,229 --> 02:44:00,239
Oh my god, I can't get around them. I cannot get around these people. There you go. You got it

1740
02:44:16,899 --> 02:44:18,899
Mm-hmm

1741
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:25,540
Yeah, it's funny there's there's already a plate there for you a little funny

1742
02:44:25,899 --> 02:44:29,100
You think you're better than me you think cuz you're in the kitchen now, you're better than me

1743
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:33,379
Oh nice tomato on a plate. We need a regular. I have it right there

1744
02:44:33,379 --> 02:44:37,899
Um, what's last me called out a single order by the way, I feel like

1745
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:43,069
You're putting either leaves on a plate or leaves and a tomato on a plate

1746
02:44:43,069 --> 02:44:46,790
Do I really need to call them out when like they're sitting right there in front of you and you can see

1747
02:44:47,270 --> 02:44:54,670
What's that emote of mine like fucking gourmet dinner? Oh, right. That's a new sub emote. Uh

1748
02:44:58,219 --> 02:45:05,829
As olives and onions as a salad topping. Yeah, give it me. All right

1749
02:45:05,829 --> 02:45:07,590
Do you want to practice it?

1750
02:45:07,590 --> 02:45:13,850
In case there's like some weird thing add chopped onion or olives onto a prepared salad. I think that's all I need to know

1751
02:45:14,469 --> 02:45:16,700
Okay

1752
02:45:16,700 --> 02:45:18,540
onions or olives

1753
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:25,790
Okay, so that's that okay. That's olives

1754
02:45:25,790 --> 02:45:28,639
I gotta get this in a let me put this in the right order though

1755
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:33,059
Cuz I know I freak out if I don't lettuce

1756
02:45:33,579 --> 02:45:36,040
tomato

1757
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:47,399
Onion olive and everything needs to be chopped. Okay, I'm good unless you want to add something we do research desk

1758
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:52,190
Another actually I need I need plates or a sink up here

1759
02:45:52,190 --> 02:45:58,819
I would like to do the research desk successfully one time to start that and see what happens

1760
02:45:58,819 --> 02:46:03,040
Yeah, though you need another counter you said and fuck you not a counter

1761
02:46:03,079 --> 02:46:09,899
I need a I need I just need access to plates because you have to give you have to give me a plate every time

1762
02:46:09,899 --> 02:46:16,149
That's kind of an issue. Anything. Um

1763
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:27,399
Is it yeah, give me the plates or put you maybe put them maybe put them like put them in

1764
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:37,680
If you're gonna do that then might as well do you do you have enough counter space with these four and this one down here

1765
02:46:37,799 --> 02:46:46,379
Trust me on the plates man. Just trust me. All right plates. Okay, I trust you research desk research desk

1766
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:55,500
No, we got one sink in cabinet. All right, avoid that. Wait a minute. There's a sink here

1767
02:46:55,500 --> 02:46:59,559
I can put us but how would you you wouldn't be able to get in here if I were to sink go over here

1768
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:08,000
Corner you could block the door. Yeah, but if you block the door it turns into a counter that we can pass stuff over

1769
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:18,059
It does. Yeah. Oh, that's actually better. Let's do that. That's a hundred times better

1770
02:47:18,100 --> 02:47:27,760
So also if I'm really in a bad situation, I can put some dirty plates here for you. Yeah, okay

1771
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:33,430
All right. I am ready to start off a

1772
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:40,590
Fantastic service here in slow service. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome everyone. Would you like to watch me wash some dirty dishes for you?

1773
02:47:40,590 --> 02:47:46,540
Oh coming right up. We need a salad with onions on it a salad with onions and

1774
02:47:47,299 --> 02:47:52,100
Olives I need plates trust me with the plates trust me with the plates bro

1775
02:47:53,690 --> 02:48:15,139
Onions and that's it and then onions and olives said yes. Okay, you don't need to chop those. Okay works

1776
02:48:15,299 --> 02:48:22,770
Hold oh my god, those guys eight salads and how much how dirty is that? It needs uh, it works onions olives and tomatoes

1777
02:48:23,129 --> 02:48:25,430
Works it works. I need plate

1778
02:48:42,629 --> 02:49:08,219
One grass one with everything. I got it. It's a plate one grass. Yep

1779
02:49:15,659 --> 02:49:28,090
Two with everything got it one plate for you. Nice moves, dude. I saw that I fucking saw that dude

1780
02:49:28,090 --> 02:49:49,860
I respect it. Don't take them both. I'm ready for the next one. We're gonna be ready. Yeah. Yep to grass

1781
02:49:50,770 --> 02:50:36,079
That's it to grass like coming up one with everything one grass one grass survey said hey, look at that

1782
02:50:37,610 --> 02:50:44,659
Solid service looking good. I think I can put more dirty plates up there for you

1783
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:48,809
yeah, the the issue that I'm having with this setup is

1784
02:50:50,440 --> 02:50:56,389
The fact that there's so many ingredients that I'm gonna run out of counter space eventually

1785
02:50:56,389 --> 02:50:58,090
I mean, I you know, I need counters on the right

1786
02:50:58,090 --> 02:51:02,780
I think also I can probably just put dirty plates straight into your sink. I should do that

1787
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:05,139
Yeah more often drop a dirty plate in there. I'll wash it

1788
02:51:05,219 --> 02:51:11,290
When does our research pay off like what what is happening? I think I'm gonna move over here, too

1789
02:51:11,290 --> 02:51:19,819
I want this like over here easy to get to and grab it. We got another counter, you know

1790
02:51:19,819 --> 02:51:25,340
Yeah, I'll take another counter right here right to the right blueprint in the filing cabinet blueprint in the filing cabinet

1791
02:51:27,819 --> 02:51:34,719
Blueprint in the filing cabinet. Do we put a blueprint from the ground into the filing cabinet?

1792
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:39,040
Like if I put a sink in it, yeah put a blueprint into the filing cabinet. It will upgrade it

1793
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:42,959
Oh my god, that would have been useful information 30 hours ago. Yeah

1794
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:49,040
We can get an Omega sink out here that would be huge actually

1795
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:59,139
I think this is a good counter space for me. We got sinks. We are gonna run out of plates there

1796
02:51:59,139 --> 02:52:01,020
We're at the extra place

1797
02:52:01,020 --> 02:52:06,829
I'm gonna put these in here just in case that's the just in case emergency plates

1798
02:52:07,049 --> 02:52:12,350
Everybody use the desk like use the desk

1799
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:17,389
So I have to go over here and it's a thing that we have to actually use it to do it

1800
02:52:17,409 --> 02:52:23,399
We have to research it you have to interact with the research desk

1801
02:52:23,680 --> 02:52:26,120
Okay. All right. So that's how it's a challenge

1802
02:52:26,120 --> 02:52:36,040
So when if you got nothing going on stir, we have to fill this thing up during the day. Okay, he's reading

1803
02:52:36,399 --> 02:52:46,620
Let's go for it. Yeah, while you're preparing the first meal, I'll be on this you got it

1804
02:52:46,620 --> 02:53:02,209
Oh, that's all it takes. Where can I go again? Okay, that's it. Oh, I like this line you got going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1805
02:53:02,209 --> 02:53:04,209
I'm ready. I won't say everything one grass

1806
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:10,860
Is that actually everything or I don't see tomato. I don't know tomato one with no tomato

1807
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:23,469
In all of my bad a little bit one miscommunication and you fucking die good thing I got these fucking eagle eyes

1808
02:53:24,270 --> 02:53:26,940
Hawk man. Why do you even need me?

1809
02:53:29,969 --> 02:53:31,969
Tomato olive I need some plates. I

1810
02:53:33,059 --> 02:53:35,059
Got you. I got you just say plates

1811
02:53:35,899 --> 02:53:40,510
Said you said just tomato and all

1812
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:44,219
Yeah

1813
02:53:44,219 --> 02:54:09,559
To grass easy one grass one tomato

1814
02:54:10,520 --> 02:54:35,920
Look at this. Look at this. Look at us here. We're insane one with everything one with onions

1815
02:54:42,639 --> 02:54:55,370
Steve plate

1816
02:54:55,489 --> 02:55:11,569
One grass one tomato boom bingo

1817
02:55:13,489 --> 02:55:27,760
That worked out pretty well, yeah, that was uh, it was our best service yet. I think we're gonna get a raise

1818
02:55:28,360 --> 02:55:32,600
So what do we do to here? I would love

1819
02:55:36,040 --> 02:55:38,520
Standards aren't as important or people will wait a long time

1820
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:50,370
What do you think? Um, I think exclusive I think a lot of the ones we've lost have been because someone's waiting outside

1821
02:55:50,809 --> 02:56:07,190
Yeah, it's true. Oof. All right, we got a lot of stuff highly flammable rug. Ooh

1822
02:56:08,479 --> 02:56:13,459
Painting you know a little bit of danger. We only have 70 coins though. Uh

1823
02:56:21,299 --> 02:56:32,850
Yeah, I think we should like think check the sink and we have to go in the filing cabinet. Oh, yeah

1824
02:56:32,850 --> 02:56:37,329
Yeah, a wash basin. Ooh

1825
02:56:37,850 --> 02:56:39,049
Oh

1826
02:56:39,049 --> 02:56:41,569
Washes up to four plates at once. Oh

1827
02:56:42,209 --> 02:56:47,129
We're on we're incredible. We just unlocked the next level. We just throw the sink away

1828
02:56:47,370 --> 02:56:50,530
There are that sink in here with the other the emergency plates

1829
02:56:50,530 --> 02:56:52,850
I don't know if you actually sell things for money or what?

1830
02:56:53,729 --> 02:56:58,950
Okay, I'm gonna get it. Yeah, and we pop that one out in front. Oh, hell

1831
02:56:58,950 --> 02:57:05,690
Yeah, four plates can go in here. Are you kidding me? You can upgrade it again. Oh, that's cool. Let's upgrade something else

1832
02:57:06,290 --> 02:57:08,409
What what do you use the most? Um

1833
02:57:10,159 --> 02:57:17,030
What can be upgraded or what are those other envelopes you got in there? I mean there is

1834
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:22,930
chandelier and

1835
02:57:22,930 --> 02:57:32,469
Whatever this is banner. Oh, well, that was free. It says if it can be upgraded. Okay

1836
02:57:32,469 --> 02:57:43,129
I don't think we have anything else. I think we're good upgrade the counter. Wait

1837
02:57:43,350 --> 02:57:46,270
Yeah, I think we need the blueprint to put in there not the actual

1838
02:57:46,989 --> 02:57:50,670
So I think we could reroll blueprints then start upgrading something might be

1839
02:57:51,069 --> 02:57:55,520
But I don't know when you get to the stage just gives you all these random Christmas

1840
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:02,030
Oh, wait, people are saying the wash basin needs water. We need to put a sink next to it. Really?

1841
02:58:02,069 --> 02:58:16,139
That's not a sink. We need to sink next to the sink. No, it doesn't they are just keep that sink there

1842
02:58:16,139 --> 02:58:23,559
There's no reason not to have that in the corner. Now put that thing back. We're back. Yeah, it's an empty space

1843
02:58:23,559 --> 02:58:29,170
They're like I can I can side put a plate in there. Okay. I'm good. Let's do it

1844
02:58:29,170 --> 02:58:41,840
Oh, good evening, sir

1845
02:58:42,360 --> 02:58:45,969
Oh

1846
02:58:45,969 --> 02:59:06,750
Salad and one with tomatoes and onions. Okay

1847
02:59:08,700 --> 02:59:10,340
Okay

1848
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:29,829
one with onions one with everything wash wash wash wash wash wash wash grass and

1849
02:59:30,469 --> 02:59:44,629
tomatoes and olives grass and tomatoes and olives

1850
02:59:45,229 --> 03:00:08,819
And then one with everything once you're done with that and you said everything. Oh, look at that insane and they all stay there

1851
03:00:09,139 --> 03:00:34,180
Insane one with onions we got somebody outside you see you see yeah, you're good

1852
03:00:37,629 --> 03:00:53,040
One with just olives still good to grass easy easy. Very easy. Very easy to play it's coming up

1853
03:01:08,739 --> 03:01:11,100
Won't everything one with tomatoes and onions

1854
03:01:24,190 --> 03:01:30,719
How come that guy let this whole plate of food?

1855
03:01:32,100 --> 03:01:33,620
That was the one you made

1856
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:41,819
Holding it there just saving space so I don't have to run so it's actually hard to get from this counter all the way to

1857
03:01:41,819 --> 03:01:43,819
The bottom right table like

1858
03:01:44,139 --> 03:01:46,139
It's a race against time

1859
03:01:46,299 --> 03:01:55,020
Slow service, but this is the best unironically that you guys have done because we're taking it slow

1860
03:01:55,020 --> 03:02:00,780
I think we also figured out that you can upgrade stuff that that helped a lot. I feel like that was a

1861
03:02:01,940 --> 03:02:03,940
very important thing to know

1862
03:02:04,340 --> 03:02:07,780
Allows customers to change their order. That is a death sentence

1863
03:02:08,340 --> 03:02:14,059
Going straight to the gulag with that one. Oh, yeah, that's terrible, but you know pumpkin pie though

1864
03:02:14,100 --> 03:02:16,100
I think they can change

1865
03:02:16,739 --> 03:02:18,739
It's just salads

1866
03:02:19,139 --> 03:02:21,579
It is but I want to learn a whole pie

1867
03:02:21,899 --> 03:02:34,479
They're gonna change it up and except for the salads all look very similar though. That's the problem. They do portioner

1868
03:02:35,340 --> 03:02:37,690
automatically performs

1869
03:02:37,690 --> 03:02:40,049
Enter on things placed in front of it. Oh

1870
03:02:42,149 --> 03:02:54,520
Upgrade counter and dining table. Should we make a bigger dining table or do come I would upgrade the counter and I think we could

1871
03:02:57,360 --> 03:03:09,280
Upgrade the counter. Yeah, I don't think we need anything else. We could even like what would we want at this point?

1872
03:03:09,639 --> 03:03:17,860
What are the work boots? They are pushed through things easier, which I assume is like doors. I don't really need it 60

1873
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:25,459
It's too much money. You think so. Yeah, I think we're fine. It's not movement speed. It's just pushed through things easier

1874
03:03:25,459 --> 03:03:30,209
I think it's better if the emergency plates are here next to me. So I don't have to go all the way down

1875
03:03:30,530 --> 03:04:00,379
All right, cool. All right, we good. Yeah. All right. What do they want? They want dog food one with everything

1876
03:04:00,379 --> 03:04:06,860
I made it in that soap shop. It's all right. Slow down slow service. We're good

1877
03:04:06,860 --> 03:04:27,620
We're everything's fine grab those remember they can change their orders. Mm-hmm

1878
03:04:28,139 --> 03:04:37,899
One with olives one with onions one with olives one with onions. Yes, sir

1879
03:04:38,180 --> 03:05:04,090
Done with olives. I gotta take that plate out. Yeah, he changes the grass. Oh, he did change the grass that

1880
03:05:04,450 --> 03:05:06,909
Bastard

1881
03:05:06,909 --> 03:05:26,459
Let me figure out what these guys want both everything with tomatoes one with olives one with tomatoes and onions

1882
03:05:26,459 --> 03:05:40,459
I got the dishes one with olives and one with tomatoes and onions. Yes, sir. Yes, sir

1883
03:05:49,180 --> 03:05:59,079
Tomatoes and onions, right tomatoes and onions and one with olives just one with onions or olives olives olives

1884
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:06,190
Go go go go go go what two onions and tomato

1885
03:06:10,959 --> 03:06:13,600
Do you change what I got one right here? I got one right here

1886
03:06:14,079 --> 03:06:16,079
What I don't even know what I did wrong

1887
03:06:16,479 --> 03:06:24,579
What happened you get the wrong plate? What did it happen? What happened? I I put I think I put the wrong plate or something

1888
03:06:24,579 --> 03:06:33,190
Down what happened? He gave them the blank plate. Oh, it all fell apart so quickly. No

1889
03:06:33,790 --> 03:06:37,760
We're doing so good. Oh

1890
03:06:38,239 --> 03:06:47,440
Fuck we unlocked medium-sized though. You forgot you left the salad on the counter

1891
03:06:49,329 --> 03:06:58,110
Grab an empty plate and take it to him and think I think you miss clicked. Yeah, I want I need to go again

1892
03:06:58,309 --> 03:07:07,729
We're like we're like right there man. I mean we have a medium place now. You want a bigger one?

1893
03:07:07,729 --> 03:07:11,969
Look at look at this one. This one's pretty good. Let's go back to the classic classic steak. You want to cook? Uh

1894
03:07:14,069 --> 03:07:16,799
Sure. Okay now that we know we can upgrade

1895
03:07:17,399 --> 03:07:28,969
Turns out changing the order actually kind of sucks because you have to constantly look for it

1896
03:07:29,090 --> 03:07:30,340
Yeah

1897
03:07:30,340 --> 03:07:33,079
It was really hard for me to like look and catch any of that

1898
03:07:33,399 --> 03:07:39,000
Especially the salad because it's like the olive sometimes blend in the onions. Yeah, that's different. That's that's hard

1899
03:07:39,159 --> 03:07:49,940
Okay, I don't know if you want the booking desk. Um, that's kind of hard mode. Maybe we just shouldn't do it

1900
03:07:49,940 --> 03:08:00,549
What's your title right now stir and I are having a breakdown. I'm having a break up truly. That's all so bad

1901
03:08:00,549 --> 03:08:04,600
Never mind. No, not true. Not true. You know set the tables where you want them

1902
03:08:04,600 --> 03:08:06,600
They're pretty spread out. Did you get them right in front here?

1903
03:08:11,649 --> 03:08:20,670
Dude, they could sit up here. Okay. I messed this up. They it's like they can do like bar seating

1904
03:08:20,790 --> 03:08:25,229
Yeah, there was like options on it too of like what it modified. Can you put it back? Oh, yeah

1905
03:08:25,229 --> 03:08:33,920
What was that decreased patients increased mess? So could you just awful? Could you do that's awful?

1906
03:08:34,040 --> 03:08:43,510
But hold on. Can you just go like right from you could probably just serve them immediately if they sit there, right?

1907
03:08:43,629 --> 03:08:49,049
Is that work or didn't know I don't think so, right?

1908
03:08:49,049 --> 03:08:52,909
It sounded like all negatives other than like how long it would take me to get to them

1909
03:08:52,930 --> 03:09:05,989
Then you put it on the other side. Wait, hold on swap it done. No, it does work

1910
03:09:06,190 --> 03:09:13,469
You have to remove the counter really so they can just come sit in the kitchen

1911
03:09:15,649 --> 03:09:19,709
That kind of sucks. Yeah, I don't I don't want them in my

1912
03:09:20,770 --> 03:09:22,930
In your space

1913
03:09:22,930 --> 03:09:30,559
Okay, so I'm gonna put one here and then one like we just go bang

1914
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:43,219
Outdoor seating can you that's a lot of way to go though. I'm so ready

1915
03:09:43,219 --> 03:09:47,739
You were just like back and forth back and forth. I know cuz I'm I don't I wanted to be three and three

1916
03:09:48,260 --> 03:09:57,840
Okay, I believe you. Okay. I'm good. You're ready to go steak Andy

1917
03:09:57,959 --> 03:10:04,969
Yeah, I'm gonna have that there so you can put dishes straight in it's it's the strap. Yeah, I'm gonna go

1918
03:10:12,819 --> 03:10:14,940
Why are you putting stakes on immediately? They?

1919
03:10:16,639 --> 03:10:22,950
Okay. All right. Okay. We want a two wells all the way

1920
03:10:22,989 --> 03:10:36,680
I think I can handle a couple of steaks

1921
03:10:44,440 --> 03:10:48,149
this person wants a

1922
03:10:49,510 --> 03:10:52,969
rare

1923
03:10:55,309 --> 03:11:04,360
You made a bunch of mediums, I want you to take that on over that customer right there

1924
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:11,659
Oh, yeah, why wouldn't you go back there? Do you start to talk like this? Oh

1925
03:11:12,299 --> 03:11:20,920
Just having a nice all-time good in my food. Just keeping calm. I had this person wants a

1926
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:23,920
medium which is right there I

1927
03:11:23,959 --> 03:11:32,479
Think I can I grab it from here kind of you can yeah, I wish you could like take down parts of the wall for this

1928
03:11:32,479 --> 03:11:33,879
counter

1929
03:11:33,879 --> 03:11:36,819
Put this in the sink

1930
03:11:37,020 --> 03:11:40,459
I think we're done

1931
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:42,479
One more fucking yokel

1932
03:11:43,059 --> 03:11:45,500
People are saying it's the wolf man voice it is

1933
03:11:46,020 --> 03:12:02,120
rare

1934
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:21,819
Golden rare why is there steak in the sink give it a little bit extra juices. All right, we just go I think we just go

1935
03:12:22,340 --> 03:12:26,739
Just go just I mean, I don't we I think we just go we don't have we don't have money for anything

1936
03:12:27,180 --> 03:12:34,760
Get his order immediately son. That's a dangerous game. You're playing right now

1937
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:45,750
Medium you see that's exactly that's not me. That's a well done. I planned it. I played it

1938
03:12:48,899 --> 03:12:50,659
I don't like this

1939
03:12:50,659 --> 03:13:01,440
Yeah, you don't like a lot of things. I see these kick up a whole bunch of grease on the floor

1940
03:13:01,940 --> 03:13:12,040
Are you just trying to make one of each kind of thing to have is ready?

1941
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:16,879
I'm trying to make the ones that take longer first so that I can make a rare quicker

1942
03:13:17,479 --> 03:13:19,780
like if they come and they want like a

1943
03:13:20,020 --> 03:13:22,620
You know a well done and a rare

1944
03:13:23,219 --> 03:13:27,309
All right, so if I have a medium one, then it's you know, it's easy to go plus one

1945
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:46,659
Media man rare enjoy. Sorry I peed on the ground

1946
03:13:55,520 --> 03:14:16,379
Rare I think that's it

1947
03:14:16,620 --> 03:14:21,559
Fucked up us to mine. We should not have we should not have immediately gone

1948
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:25,440
We needed to put a blueprint in the research. We need to look for a research

1949
03:14:25,799 --> 03:14:27,799
Bumper to bump up the research

1950
03:14:28,600 --> 03:14:34,530
Shucks, we're gonna get their research going ASAP on one of those that that kitchen sink

1951
03:14:35,569 --> 03:14:37,569
revolutionary gradable plates

1952
03:14:38,059 --> 03:14:39,700
sharp cutlery

1953
03:14:39,700 --> 03:14:44,500
Place on table to have customers eat faster. Ooh, that's actually pretty good

1954
03:14:44,500 --> 03:14:49,739
Oh, I'm upgrading the sink. We're going for it. You need a research table

1955
03:14:49,739 --> 03:14:54,200
Don't you think you need the research table to actually research it?

1956
03:14:54,200 --> 03:14:57,239
But it looks like it's like holding that in is oh we got by the desk

1957
03:14:57,440 --> 03:15:02,579
Huh research desk, yeah, we're not one we don't have enough. Oh, yeah, we do. It's 40 out of 60

1958
03:15:02,620 --> 03:15:12,149
Okay, when we open you start researching you ready? Yeah, you got it. Let's go

1959
03:15:12,270 --> 03:15:28,329
Is that the room code that is the seed for this game? I guess I don't know why this seeds

1960
03:15:29,370 --> 03:15:30,809
rare

1961
03:15:30,809 --> 03:16:00,340
Rare about to make some pumpkin. Ah

1962
03:16:01,139 --> 03:16:07,780
They really want us to make that pumpkin pie. Hopefully these guys want mediums

1963
03:16:10,420 --> 03:16:12,420
rare and well, sorry

1964
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:37,620
Rare too easy

1965
03:16:38,379 --> 03:16:39,459
dominated

1966
03:16:39,459 --> 03:16:42,139
one shot one kill

1967
03:16:42,700 --> 03:16:49,100
You do by playing overwatch. I have been a bit lately

1968
03:16:49,700 --> 03:16:51,139
You like it?

1969
03:16:51,139 --> 03:16:59,469
Yeah, is it fun? Like should I play it? Should you play it? Probably not. Okay, I

1970
03:17:03,690 --> 03:17:08,409
Think you should try it one probably when the PvE stuff comes out. That's a play together. That's what I'm waiting for

1971
03:17:09,090 --> 03:17:11,090
Is that coming at any point?

1972
03:17:11,930 --> 03:17:13,489
Um

1973
03:17:13,489 --> 03:17:20,450
Apparently like piecemealing it it might be like another like six months sometime in my life. Yeah, my goodness

1974
03:17:20,450 --> 03:17:26,500
It's basically like a year away. I thought that might be generous. Wasn't that like the whole selling point of

1975
03:17:27,780 --> 03:17:30,620
Yeah was but they realized that was taking so long that they

1976
03:17:31,020 --> 03:17:39,569
Said okay, we'll do multiplayer stuff and not like hold that off because that's actually kind of sort of a little done interesting

1977
03:17:41,950 --> 03:17:44,629
Yeah, we 20% slower sounds awful

1978
03:17:44,870 --> 03:17:48,180
Okay, so we should have an upgraded thing over there

1979
03:17:53,739 --> 03:18:00,840
What kind of psycho wants chopped tomato on their steak like you go to a nice steak restaurant, which is what we are

1980
03:18:00,840 --> 03:18:06,100
We're incredible. Mm-hmm to like just tomato slices

1981
03:18:06,299 --> 03:18:14,629
Yeah, that's kind of weird or is it like a tomato sauce tomato sauce would be kind of weird, too

1982
03:18:14,629 --> 03:18:22,629
Oh, we don't have the money for this so we can upgrade it again do it again. Okay. I'll start here. Um

1983
03:18:24,579 --> 03:18:34,829
Hold on I did the breaking bad thing where I haven't let my eyes hurt. I haven't blinked in like three hours. Okay, okay

1984
03:18:41,750 --> 03:18:47,370
Order up this person wants

1985
03:18:48,489 --> 03:18:50,489
Probably the new thing I would imagine

1986
03:18:50,770 --> 03:19:04,690
Nope, just a well done. Oh, yeah, I gotta keep that in mind that I might have to chop some tomatoes

1987
03:19:05,049 --> 03:19:07,959
Yeah, that's some dangerous cooking

1988
03:19:08,479 --> 03:19:21,020
these two want I love that rain sound they want a

1989
03:19:22,139 --> 03:19:24,139
medium with tomato and well done

1990
03:19:31,260 --> 03:19:33,260
You already have a medium here stir

1991
03:19:38,850 --> 03:19:44,030
Fuck

1992
03:19:44,829 --> 03:19:55,149
Doing too many things these two would like I need I need more counter space they need

1993
03:19:56,149 --> 03:19:58,149
medium and rare

1994
03:20:10,700 --> 03:20:19,959
I'm waiting you're burning. It's burning. You're burning it. I don't care what

1995
03:20:21,239 --> 03:20:25,340
No, give it to me. Oh

1996
03:20:25,459 --> 03:20:27,459
It's bad news

1997
03:20:28,659 --> 03:20:30,659
It's bad news

1998
03:20:31,100 --> 03:20:33,100
Wait, wait

1999
03:20:33,139 --> 03:20:35,139
Too much you cooked it too much

2000
03:20:36,059 --> 03:20:38,340
This is ugly. It's getting ugly over here

2001
03:20:42,459 --> 03:20:46,100
Everything's fine. It's savable. We just need one rare

2002
03:20:48,340 --> 03:20:52,860
I'm sure I'm like over complicating. I'm trying to like be maximum efficiency

2003
03:20:56,629 --> 03:21:01,329
You're okay. We're good. Everything's fine. I don't have to take that order yet

2004
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:06,840
Yeah, this this grease ground we need like a mop as soon as we can get it

2005
03:21:07,239 --> 03:21:18,120
It is so hard to walk around and click on the right thing. Okay, you good to take an order

2006
03:21:19,000 --> 03:21:28,090
Yeah, rare rare one of them tomato. Yeah, I can't even get in the door

2007
03:21:35,120 --> 03:21:43,549
Why does my steak taste like soap I

2008
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:54,520
Need a mop. Yeah, and if you're ever like

2009
03:21:55,079 --> 03:21:58,719
Really waiting for me. Let's come do that. I need a I need a clean boy

2010
03:21:59,280 --> 03:22:03,420
All right, I think I need to get on it earlier because you can clean the small ones quicker get him up

2011
03:22:03,719 --> 03:22:09,309
Off is better. I mean if we get offered one

2012
03:22:09,989 --> 03:22:11,030
gas

2013
03:22:11,030 --> 03:22:19,200
Eight more plates another counter you wanted that right and a sink you want the counter. Oh

2014
03:22:21,159 --> 03:22:29,709
But what's wrong? Hold on. This is a dishwasher. It's like a full dishwasher

2015
03:22:29,870 --> 03:22:39,229
I don't know if that's a problem. Is it it's probably better. It does it automatically. No, that's phenomenal

2016
03:22:39,270 --> 03:22:42,469
That means it'll do it without us even touching it automatically

2017
03:22:42,469 --> 03:22:46,110
I was just thinking in the case of a kitchen where I actually need sink water

2018
03:22:46,110 --> 03:22:50,049
But I guess you know, we saw the sink. Do you want the um, oh we only have 15

2019
03:22:53,879 --> 03:23:03,639
Yelling at us. They're saying I'm great more. Yeah, I'm upgrading something. Are you are you doing you confident? Yeah, I'm upgrading a grill

2020
03:23:03,639 --> 03:23:14,139
All right, I'll do the upgrade when we start is that where you want the dishwasher? Yeah, that's good. Cuz I got actually yes

2021
03:23:14,899 --> 03:23:16,459
Okay

2022
03:23:16,459 --> 03:23:22,469
Maybe it's on the left side next day because it's kind of far. We're good

2023
03:23:22,469 --> 03:23:28,940
Okay, taking it nice and slow cooking to order. All right. Here you are

2024
03:23:31,659 --> 03:23:33,819
well with tomato medium tomato, I

2025
03:23:50,120 --> 03:23:58,360
Desperately need another counter now we need

2026
03:24:00,040 --> 03:24:02,040
Rare tomato well tomato

2027
03:24:02,159 --> 03:24:26,620
So when you do that, I can't place the tomato now. Yeah, all right now any well tomato and then this guy

2028
03:24:26,620 --> 03:24:29,110
What do you want?

2029
03:24:29,110 --> 03:24:44,409
medium tomato

2030
03:24:45,329 --> 03:24:52,120
Wait with these people might want well, yeah

2031
03:24:52,120 --> 03:24:59,250
No, they were too medium. So we need two mediums one tomato and one rare tomato two mediums one tomato

2032
03:24:59,809 --> 03:25:07,170
Okay. Now I need a medium and a rare tomato

2033
03:25:07,750 --> 03:25:20,959
You need a plate. All right, so I need a rare tomato. Yes, darling. Oh

2034
03:25:22,520 --> 03:25:40,739
All right, this person wants a medium tomato and a well

2035
03:25:47,649 --> 03:25:49,950
This thing is amazing by the way

2036
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:58,680
This thing is absolutely just cracked out. I just need a well. I think that's it for the day

2037
03:25:59,399 --> 03:26:07,110
All right. That was a little that got a little heavy, but we're okay. I got a little rough

2038
03:26:07,110 --> 03:26:19,889
I've written just one counter dude. Just one counter the plate rack next to the sink. It is it is though

2039
03:26:29,129 --> 03:26:34,709
Charming sure we have never actually successfully set up decorations for one of these

2040
03:26:34,709 --> 03:26:42,750
No, imagine going to a nice restaurant and the dishwasher is in the dining room

2041
03:26:42,950 --> 03:26:47,340
Oh

2042
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:58,790
Dark board. We don't have enough money to do this though. Yeah, aha a danger hob

2043
03:26:59,510 --> 03:27:12,620
Double speed but catches fire after burning food. I can keep that we can we can get the final upgrade on that

2044
03:27:13,659 --> 03:27:18,940
Walllight, how do I move this? I don't want to this isn't a really stupid place

2045
03:27:20,450 --> 03:27:25,590
Do these blueprints get re-rolled into useful stuff cuz like really it's counter space

2046
03:27:25,590 --> 03:27:39,549
I don't know but the banner over the dishwasher. I gotta pick the banner up. I don't think I can I think it's just here forever

2047
03:27:40,030 --> 03:27:46,780
You know, yeah, that's that's annoying me. I'm actually very upset

2048
03:27:46,780 --> 03:27:50,250
It's pissing me off how the way this is and I can't pick it up. I hate it

2049
03:27:50,250 --> 03:28:01,250
I don't think I can move it. Oh, thank God. Okay

2050
03:28:05,190 --> 03:28:19,129
Christmas. All right. Um, I'm nervous. I'm nervous. You nervous. Hold on. I need to do it some adjustments here

2051
03:28:19,170 --> 03:28:40,819
Okay, I think I'm okay. Hold on. I want this not quite against that

2052
03:28:40,819 --> 03:28:44,530
Okay, I am

Plate rack plate. I didn't press it plate somebody saying plate rack plate rack plate rack plate rack. What about it?

2054
03:28:53,760 --> 03:28:58,920

2055
03:28:58,920 --> 03:29:06,690
Why I don't know they're just yelling it plate rack swap with the sink swap the sink with the plate rack

2056
03:29:06,690 --> 03:29:13,430
Oh, yeah, you know, it's because I the dishwasher is over here and I can just put the clean plates onto the dish

2057
03:29:13,430 --> 03:29:17,139
Okay, I get it. Yeah, you guys are right. That's true

2058
03:29:17,180 --> 03:29:23,090
You're calling me how to telling me how to run my kitchen like telling me how to raise my kids

2059
03:29:23,209 --> 03:29:31,319
Hey, how do you feel? You all right? This is the big one is we have to get past this hump. Sure

2060
03:29:31,319 --> 03:29:34,379
I remember a research in the beginning. Oh, yep

2061
03:29:39,170 --> 03:29:48,719
There's nothing to research. Oh, I guess it's maxed out. All right. This person is coming in

2062
03:29:48,719 --> 03:29:52,479
They want a nice delicious steak and they want it to be

2063
03:29:53,319 --> 03:30:01,590
Medium just medium nothing else. Nice work

2064
03:30:05,579 --> 03:30:08,100
Hey open, what does it think?

2065
03:30:08,899 --> 03:30:11,579
Shit, there's nothing in there. This person wants a

2066
03:30:12,379 --> 03:30:25,120
Yeah, well with an onion with a tomato. Okay, I'll give an onion well with a tomato. No tomato. There we go

2067
03:30:27,879 --> 03:30:47,549
This person wants oh my god get out this bad well with tomato this person wants well with tomato

2068
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:53,069
Wow, how original?

2069
03:30:53,989 --> 03:31:13,180
Good

2070
03:31:13,219 --> 03:31:28,809
Medium only got them service up clean it. What are you doing? You're fucking idiot. What's happening to my guy?

2071
03:31:28,850 --> 03:31:30,850
You won't clean it that

2072
03:31:31,370 --> 03:31:46,459
My life rare medium both tomato. I fucking stopped that move that plate

2073
03:31:48,180 --> 03:31:53,379
You cannot do that you need more counters put the plates with the plates

2074
03:31:53,379 --> 03:32:00,579
There's a plate stack you need more counters. That does not fix the idea that you need more counters. I do need more counters

2075
03:32:01,889 --> 03:32:03,889
We agree oops

2076
03:32:07,209 --> 03:32:21,930
Two wells one with a tomato, where's my plate? Where'd you take my plate? They're all stacked up

2077
03:32:21,930 --> 03:32:27,239
You told me not to do that anymore. Yeah, but I set the plate there at that time on purpose. Hey, but you

2078
03:32:28,760 --> 03:32:32,159
We talked about okay didn't okay. I you don't think I know what I'm doing over here

2079
03:32:35,500 --> 03:32:44,129
That's the 300th Boston accent this stream. Oh dude this guy from the East Coast or something. I don't know

2080
03:32:48,700 --> 03:32:57,159
Um bone in steak serve with the bone which must be thrown away after yeah

2081
03:32:57,159 --> 03:33:07,430
I just gotta move bone and steak which I need to figure out like if I need to do something special for that

2082
03:33:07,430 --> 03:33:17,829
Yeah, remove. I think I have to do that. I think I have to take the bone out remove bone before cleaning

2083
03:33:18,069 --> 03:33:21,629
So give me the trash because I have to do that here

2084
03:33:21,629 --> 03:33:36,219
Oh, no, I have to like it's a whole separate cut of meat. We we need a counter gas limiter

2085
03:33:36,500 --> 03:33:44,610
No counter. All right, dude. Okay. Well, I'm gonna buy the extra hub

2086
03:33:45,090 --> 03:33:56,170
And I can use that as a pretend counter take out the upgrade is the one in there. Yeah, I got it

2087
03:33:56,170 --> 03:34:05,239
Oh, you got it already. Okay. Let's upgrade the plate stack or maybe the gas limiter because this is super dependent

2088
03:34:05,319 --> 03:34:15,069
What does the gas limiter do 70 burn 75% slower?

2089
03:34:18,440 --> 03:34:23,610
Burn slower but cook slower. Oh

2090
03:34:24,250 --> 03:34:34,250
Burning has not been a problem at all. I think the entire time we've been playing how much money do we have?

2091
03:34:34,489 --> 03:34:39,600
25 we can get these breadsticks, but I don't know how they work

2092
03:34:39,719 --> 03:34:42,979
It kind of I tried to use them it kind of like a detriment

2093
03:34:42,979 --> 03:34:55,760
I think we do you put the plates or plates in the research. Yeah, okay

2094
03:34:55,760 --> 03:35:01,100
I'm ready. You ready to go for bone in I'm ready to bone

2095
03:35:01,100 --> 03:35:07,590
Oh see you need to throw the bone away then I need to throw them. Oh the garbage we did

2096
03:35:09,110 --> 03:35:12,409
That's GG fuck that's GG. What does he want?

2097
03:35:12,450 --> 03:35:17,370
Also got a weight for them now in case they want bone in her steak

2098
03:35:17,370 --> 03:35:29,620
This is a rare tomato. Look at that. Look at that cook speed. Boom tomato. Just testing you

2099
03:35:39,790 --> 03:35:45,719
medium tomato

2100
03:35:45,719 --> 03:35:56,799
That is so convenient. We don't even need all these burners now. It's just way faster. Yeah, I need to move those plates

2101
03:35:56,799 --> 03:35:58,799
I like to have the the middle open

2102
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:06,440
they want

2103
03:36:06,879 --> 03:36:08,879
They went well and then rare tomato

2104
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:16,850
Look at that. That's so much better. Well, you have to be on top of that though

2105
03:36:16,850 --> 03:36:34,440
You get that convert I can like fuck it up so quickly the bone in not very popular. Hey

2106
03:36:37,450 --> 03:36:46,579
Rare tomato well done the plate down, please

2107
03:36:47,860 --> 03:36:49,860
Put the plate down, please sir. Ah

2108
03:36:51,329 --> 03:36:55,090
Fucking I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. Yeah. No, we're good. We're good. We're good

2109
03:36:55,729 --> 03:37:09,860
Great tomato thought it was the other way around. We're good. This person wants a bone in tomato and that I that looks like medium

2110
03:37:10,459 --> 03:37:23,700
Medium bone in with tomato. There we go. Sir. I'll take this order

2111
03:37:24,219 --> 03:37:30,920
Good good. Oh

2112
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:42,079
Trash you gotta throw that away. I can't go in here until it's thrown away. Yeah, that's I

2113
03:37:42,840 --> 03:37:46,399
Need that over here. So hopefully we make it through this good that they didn't order

2114
03:37:47,760 --> 03:37:52,399
That would have been so awful. And then how do we take the trash out because the trash fills up?

2115
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:54,440
We need a well tomato. I

2116
03:37:56,829 --> 03:37:58,829
This trash outside I can do that

2117
03:37:58,870 --> 03:38:03,100
Alright, we're good. We made it

2118
03:38:03,100 --> 03:38:08,059
Yeah, I can't even dump a second one. Yeah, we just have to move that next time. We're good

2119
03:38:08,600 --> 03:38:14,280
They bone into mate. Yeah, I like the way that it rings

2120
03:38:14,840 --> 03:38:22,209
Okay, cool. Alright, so priority number one. I need the trash in here

2121
03:38:30,760 --> 03:38:33,610
auto plater

2122
03:38:33,610 --> 03:38:37,739
conveyor oh

2123
03:38:37,739 --> 03:38:42,280
Finally a counter didn't you want another one? I don't understand this one

2124
03:38:42,280 --> 03:38:56,079
It says automatically plates anything placed in front of it. I don't know we pick up the tonight pick the trash up

2125
03:38:56,840 --> 03:39:09,379
Okay, that solves literally every problem

2126
03:39:09,739 --> 03:39:18,930
What we did upgrade the plates? Uh, they need to upgrade again again. I was looking at let them let them cook a little longer. Um

2127
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:27,639
I mean, I think we're good if you got the trash out there. Oh wait, that's another counter

2128
03:39:27,639 --> 03:39:45,290
We're taking with countertop countertop countertop. I think I'm gonna put this up. Yeah, like right there. Okay

2129
03:39:47,180 --> 03:39:51,100
Do I need I need to upgrade this right? Yep. Let's go

2130
03:39:52,260 --> 03:39:55,620
No, and I'll be up wait what it cannot

2131
03:39:56,139 --> 03:40:03,260
Okay, then I don't really understand what it does. I think some things can only be operated once

2132
03:40:03,260 --> 03:40:07,319
I mean, I don't understand what the auto plater does in general. Oh

2133
03:40:08,079 --> 03:40:11,530
All right rare, you know

2134
03:40:22,260 --> 03:40:24,260
upgrade this I

2135
03:40:24,340 --> 03:40:30,799
Think this this grill also doesn't make grease all over the ground

2136
03:40:31,520 --> 03:40:32,559
medium

2137
03:40:32,559 --> 03:40:42,659
Things got infinitely easier. I could see where that would be hard to use though because it just happens so quickly

2138
03:40:43,180 --> 03:40:55,319
All right, we got

2139
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:59,540
Bone rare bone in rare with a rare bone in tomato rare

2140
03:41:00,200 --> 03:41:06,959
No, it needs the tomato. No rare bone in tomato rare. Oh

2141
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:09,319

2142
03:41:09,319 --> 03:41:21,950
We're good. My old age is kicking in just that's a well done bone in

03:41:46,840 --> 03:41:48,840
I was gonna wait but yeah good

2146
03:41:49,159 --> 03:41:57,340
Now we need rest. Well, well tomatoes made. Oh well tomato. Well tomato

2147
03:42:02,049 --> 03:42:04,049

Okay, got two plates for you. Oh

We were born for this. Okay, let me get this other order

2150
03:42:19,959 --> 03:42:22,840

03:43:15,260 --> 03:43:17,879
That was scary. Okay

2160
03:43:18,520 --> 03:43:19,739
incoming

2161
03:43:19,739 --> 03:43:21,180

2162
03:43:21,180 --> 03:43:27,559

2163
03:43:27,559 --> 03:43:34,870
I think it's two. I don't know about that there buck. Oh, all right. These guys. All right, we need a

2164
03:43:35,469 --> 03:43:37,469
bone in bone in bone in

2165
03:43:38,270 --> 03:43:40,469
Bone in rare with tomato bone in well

2166
03:43:41,069 --> 03:43:50,930
Man, if my guy could just learn how to take this thing off of a plate

2167
03:43:51,610 --> 03:43:55,069
That's too much

2168
03:43:55,959 --> 03:44:00,399
That's not rare that this is well. Oh, no. No, you're good. Yes. All right. I thought I was looking at one stop

2169
03:44:00,399 --> 03:44:03,909
All right. Well rare needs a trail. Yeah, the color of those is uh

2170
03:44:05,190 --> 03:44:07,780
Weird we're good. We did it

2171
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:20,219
Okay, can you can you upgrade the trash? I don't think there's a trash blueprint. This is the furthest we've ever been

2172
03:44:20,219 --> 03:44:24,540
I think you should put the trash near the door so you can take it out easier. Yeah, it's gonna do

2173
03:44:24,819 --> 03:44:35,079
It's like right next to the door. What if I just told me at all?

2174
03:44:35,559 --> 03:44:45,489
Why would you want to tomato things? I don't know. Maybe you can upgrade it. Yeah, looks like you can

2175
03:44:46,010 --> 03:44:50,290
He knows if you can actually Oh meat more meat. Yeah. Oh

2176
03:44:50,989 --> 03:44:59,739
Oh, they don't like that, okay, they don't want to sit next to like the smelly trash, okay

2177
03:44:59,739 --> 03:45:04,729
All right, we're good

2178
03:45:04,729 --> 03:45:10,780
Yeah, this I what I need an explanation what this auto plater does because you like auto plates

2179
03:45:10,780 --> 03:45:18,299
What if I put something on it's already going on the plate? Um, let's see if anybody in chat tells us what on twitch integration

2180
03:45:18,620 --> 03:45:26,030
It it's not happening right now. Not tonight. It's this you're gonna like open up a page log in like link do a link

2181
03:45:26,969 --> 03:45:28,969
Activate it. Oh, I get it

2182
03:45:28,969 --> 03:45:34,280
It's for like if you have the conveyor belts

2183
03:45:34,399 --> 03:45:43,059
Then it would like you'd conveyor belt a plate down in front of the auto plater, but we don't have conveyor belt

2184
03:45:46,260 --> 03:45:52,270
We have a hundred dollars. There's nothing else here. We need not really we could upgrade something. Is that a counter?

2185
03:45:54,409 --> 03:46:00,360
That is a counter here darling. We could reroll. I'm gonna upgrade this counter

2186
03:46:00,360 --> 03:46:07,379
We don't want to reroll the tomatoes. Uh, no, I just want to like ten bucks. Wait, hold on. Let me make the counter. Sure

2187
03:46:07,420 --> 03:46:15,579
That's my shirt. That's an Andy mark shirt do it. We need a Andy mark a mop would be nice still

2188
03:46:15,780 --> 03:46:25,190
That's what I'm saying. We should just reroll reroll. You're out there. Let's reroll scrubbing brush

2189
03:46:25,510 --> 03:46:29,780
Wipe the floor scrub the dishes don't think too much

2190
03:46:29,780 --> 03:46:37,909
So hold this to do floor two times faster on floor messes and scrub is three times faster on something wellies

2191
03:46:37,909 --> 03:46:50,659
I think this makes a huge mess, but you don't care about the mess anymore and then another dish rack

2192
03:46:50,659 --> 03:46:55,940
I think we're ready. What about the dish right? Yes

2193
03:46:56,459 --> 03:46:57,940
Yeah

2194
03:46:57,940 --> 03:47:06,629
No, let's go. We are wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, maybe the dish rack

2195
03:47:06,629 --> 03:47:12,989
We're we're like we're limited we can clean plates quickly, but we have a stack of four for this whole fucking place

2196
03:47:12,989 --> 03:47:29,549
All right, let's get it here. I'll pass it to you the wall. No, I won't. Well, what was that?

2197
03:47:29,549 --> 03:47:34,950
Why does it look so different? Wait, there's no dishes. It's a dish rack

2198
03:47:34,950 --> 03:47:42,909
Oh, so you can put dishes in the dish rack, but who cares right now?

2199
03:47:43,270 --> 03:47:54,200
Wait you go away. Wait, what is it? Yeah, who cares? It's for dirty plates, but I don't get it

2200
03:47:54,200 --> 03:48:00,229
All right. Well like that here. We'll just put that in the we have so much money. We're so wealthy

2201
03:48:00,229 --> 03:48:04,309
We're so well off but what I mean even matter it's for dirty plates

2202
03:48:04,309 --> 03:48:13,270
Yeah, but what does that do that doesn't we don't have whatever. Yeah

2203
03:48:13,270 --> 03:48:22,049
I guess if the dishwasher is currently running and I could put some in there better you want the wellies

2204
03:48:22,090 --> 03:48:29,319
What do they do you make a huge mess but your character does not care you you never oh, yes

2205
03:48:29,319 --> 03:48:31,319
You should put those on up there. Yeah

2206
03:48:31,879 --> 03:48:37,899
Put them in here just the same space and I'll put them on will you play putting them over there?

2207
03:48:37,979 --> 03:48:52,709
No, what you're doing my wellies stop. Okay, let's go can't upgrade you better plus to that. What's up? Okay, here we go

2208
03:48:52,709 --> 03:48:59,649
Oh, they're still hungry. They're conjoined into one person. I thought I was one person. I'm gonna hate you both

2209
03:48:59,649 --> 03:49:07,000
No, you don't. All right. We need two double well bone ins. We have four plates. I think this is it

2210
03:49:08,340 --> 03:49:21,760
Four plates. Yeah, I don't like it's not done

2211
03:49:25,879 --> 03:49:29,579
My god, oh my oh my

2212
03:49:30,440 --> 03:49:38,799
I'm like I'm like colorblind to them. I know that's it

2213
03:49:39,540 --> 03:49:42,340
The bone ins are a little there look a little finicky

2214
03:49:42,500 --> 03:49:49,739
No, like like like phase one is the same color as phase three fucking

2215
03:49:50,500 --> 03:50:00,180
Fucking hell man. Hey, we got a new stuff. There's a colorblind mode

2216
03:50:00,180 --> 03:50:02,540
It puts a letter next to the meat. Really?

2217
03:50:02,540 --> 03:50:08,879
I would I would not have made like any mistakes at all ever ever in my life

2218
03:50:09,159 --> 03:50:16,319
Does it letters inside looking? Where is it? Oh accessibility? Oh

2219
03:50:19,229 --> 03:50:27,489
That's that's big that's actually a huge deal. Let me cook these pizzas. Let's let's get a let's get a pizza run

2220
03:50:27,610 --> 03:50:30,299
You want to do pizza run?

2221
03:50:30,299 --> 03:50:39,090
Maybe a medium floor plan with a pizza would be huge. I don't really care about the floor plan

2222
03:50:41,159 --> 03:50:45,879
I'm just the pizza god. We need to get to day 15

2223
03:50:45,879 --> 03:50:52,680
First of all, I don't think we need to first beat this place the garage items in the loading bay

2224
03:50:52,680 --> 03:51:02,399
Oh, we did get garage items. Where are they? Are those the garage? I was wondering about that. Like nothing is really explained. Oh

2225
03:51:04,520 --> 03:51:13,500
We get to start with a wash basin. We get to start with this stuff. Whatever we put whatever two things we bring in here

2226
03:51:20,360 --> 03:51:26,280
Fucking hard mode butts candles for patients

2227
03:51:28,030 --> 03:51:37,110
Yeah, we restart from the beginning. It's a cooking cooking a rogue like extra life. You're going the whole way

2228
03:51:37,110 --> 03:51:50,350
Oh, that's actually pretty big deal. That's great. That's actually really helpful. I'm good to go. What you doing a small one

2229
03:51:50,469 --> 03:51:56,540
What's I can't tell which one's big? I think the long one here is in wait

2230
03:51:56,540 --> 03:52:06,059
Do we even have a medium and you only do pizza on small or is it wrong?

2231
03:52:06,059 --> 03:52:09,020
These are the three we were offered. There's like a whole bunch of them

2232
03:52:09,020 --> 03:52:16,090
It's probably random. I'll just pick the one you like if it says plus upgradeable on the blueprint

2233
03:52:16,090 --> 03:52:28,479
See if it says it it does not on this one. But yeah, well we have um, we also have upgrade kits

2234
03:52:28,639 --> 03:52:37,200
Should we replace the extra life? I think that would make us start with a dishwasher upgrade at up

2235
03:52:37,200 --> 03:53:00,219
Wait, hold on. Once you level up you can do any seed but for now, it's mid ones. Okay upgrade the sink. Wait, so

2236
03:53:01,020 --> 03:53:11,840
Mean like wait a minute. I didn't even realize you could walk through there. How is this? Oh, okay

2237
03:53:11,920 --> 03:53:22,479
Wait, what did that do just wash? Oh, we start dude. It starts with the dishwasher. Okay, what happened to the other thing?

2238
03:53:22,479 --> 03:53:36,540
Uh, it used it consumed it we can do it again with an upgrade yet. You want it again? Yeah. Yeah

2239
03:53:37,290 --> 03:53:43,809
What is better than a dishwasher? I don't know. What is it dude? It's an assault rifle soaking

2240
03:53:45,770 --> 03:53:54,639
Washes dishes but cannot provide water for recipes. So it's just like a soap a super sink. All right

2241
03:53:54,639 --> 03:54:01,469
I am I am about to make every pizza. I actually could I could what time is that?

2242
03:54:01,469 --> 03:54:12,440
I want to order a pizza. Somebody said that thing sucks. Uh-huh. Okay good. You're gonna get a pizza. No, it's too late

2243
03:54:12,579 --> 03:54:29,530
Wait, this is throwing it away. Okay, that extra life has to be inside. So so

2244
03:54:30,170 --> 03:54:42,399
Soaking sink is this thing this thing suck. How is this better than dishwasher? I don't know. We'll find out do this IRL

2245
03:54:42,399 --> 03:54:50,450
All right, you did it. That's kind of fun

2246
03:54:56,030 --> 03:55:17,239
This turns back up

2247
03:55:17,239 --> 03:55:25,440
I'll keep it where it was should you have this sink over there or should I have it over here?

2248
03:55:25,440 --> 03:55:30,540
I feel like it's gonna be a mess. It's not a dishwasher. It's just soaking sink

2249
03:55:31,479 --> 03:55:36,280
Let's do what we did in the other one and put it like in the middle there so that we can all just dump dishes

2250
03:55:36,280 --> 03:55:39,280
Into that. Yeah, can you put the

2251
03:55:40,649 --> 03:55:48,690
No, that'd be hard. Okay. No, if you put the dish rack like over here so I can um, but clean dishes

2252
03:55:48,690 --> 03:55:53,829
Oh, no, actually, you can just take them out. Can you the booking desk is free? Yeah, but isn't it make it harder

2253
03:55:53,829 --> 03:56:03,180
I think it would help early on because then you can make more money if you can just like serve more people in a day

2254
03:56:03,180 --> 03:56:22,549
Yeah, let's just put it up here. Okay. It's a what is happening. I don't know. Oh my hand was oh

2255
03:56:26,899 --> 03:56:39,370
That's in a bad spot. She's pizza. She really forgot how to make it. That's day one. They don't fucking care

2256
03:56:40,450 --> 03:57:03,680
He's never coming back. Oh, yeah more than one person our kitchen needs a little work. It does

2257
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:09,600
Are you dizzy? No, I'm good. Oh, hold on

2258
03:57:10,079 --> 03:57:21,920
You can just stand there with that food and you can wait how many plates can go in the sink?

2259
03:57:22,159 --> 03:57:29,579
It ain't just one right? It should be at least four. It's

2260
03:57:30,180 --> 03:57:32,379
Ottawa I'd like this one. It's one

2261
03:57:33,059 --> 03:57:37,190
It's oh, I see

2262
03:57:37,790 --> 03:57:45,639
This is awful. It's one that okay the dishwasher can have up to four

2263
03:57:46,079 --> 03:57:51,200
Why can this only have one that was underwater by the way the tier two one can have?

2264
03:57:51,760 --> 03:57:54,600
Four in it when you wash them all at once, but you have to do it manually

2265
03:57:55,239 --> 03:58:02,680
It's just faster. Yeah, but I would rather have the convenience of putting more than one in

2266
03:58:03,200 --> 03:58:18,739
Because otherwise you just it just piles up. This thing kind of sucks

2267
03:58:29,209 --> 03:58:38,600
We need another sink. Let's upgrade the sink of our sink sucks are fully upgraded super sink. Okay, we need a desk then

2268
03:58:58,100 --> 03:59:12,920
Oh, we're missing one dollar for the research desk and the research desk itself is upgradeable weird

2269
03:59:14,690 --> 03:59:28,420
Interesting put the research desk in the drawer instead

2270
03:59:28,420 --> 03:59:40,180
I wonder what the but how would this we need a research desk to research the research desk upgrade sure do

2271
03:59:40,479 --> 03:59:54,639
Yeah, but you save it. We already have I mean, I don't know I think we're kind of think let's put the sink in there to save it

2272
03:59:54,639 --> 04:00:00,379
Ah, there's a something in there already. Are you take it out?

2273
04:00:01,020 --> 04:00:13,000
X. Hey, okay. All right. Let's try it. I can't believe we're going all 30 days. Good luck

2274
04:00:16,219 --> 04:00:18,219
I

2275
04:00:18,379 --> 04:00:43,969
Bet you they want a cheese pizza better not add they do put in the sink

2276
04:00:43,969 --> 04:01:11,319
I feel like you should move one of those counters to over here. Yeah, I agree. What do you guys want pizza? Yes, you do

2277
04:01:14,110 --> 04:01:17,290
Welcome to the restaurant. We can only make cheese pizzas

2278
04:01:18,909 --> 04:01:23,870
Pizza's good, you know what you're doing if you have a recipe and it's really great. You don't need to do anything else

2279
04:01:23,909 --> 04:01:31,920
Please be sure this guy wanted cheese pizza

2280
04:01:33,760 --> 04:01:56,350
He's just gonna pre serve every table. You don't have pepperoni. We have nothing

2281
04:01:57,010 --> 04:02:02,010
We only have cheese and pizza. Do you like pepperoni? I don't think I even asked you that I love

2282
04:02:02,409 --> 04:02:04,870
Are you a big?

2283
04:02:05,670 --> 04:02:13,069
Circle pepperoni soft kind of guy. Are you a small little tiny circle crispy crispy on the edges better

2284
04:02:13,190 --> 04:02:17,770
Okay, I'm noticing you're like crispy things I do but here's the one problem with that though

2285
04:02:17,770 --> 04:02:18,569
I do like it

2286
04:02:18,569 --> 04:02:25,620
but sometimes the pepperoni all the edges curl up and you get these pools of kind of oil in the

2287
04:02:25,940 --> 04:02:29,639
Middle of all the little ones it can it can

2288
04:02:30,200 --> 04:02:34,280
Not a huge fan of that, but it's okay if I'm in the mood for that

2289
04:02:34,940 --> 04:02:37,420
There's this place right here. They have really small pepperonis

2290
04:02:37,420 --> 04:02:46,299
I've only ordered from here like once small pepperonis and they curl up into like pods like craters on the moon for all of

2291
04:02:46,299 --> 04:02:54,250
The gross pizza juice to just like like miniature lakes. That's exactly what I just said. Yeah, I didn't like it

2292
04:02:54,250 --> 04:03:01,659
You don't like that I did not like that I felt like I was like IV dripping like pizza grease into my vein

2293
04:03:01,760 --> 04:03:07,340
Yeah, that's what I mean the small ones to have a tendency to do that. That's that's okay

2294
04:03:07,340 --> 04:03:14,100
Well, I guess I'm in like a medium like normal pepperoni cuz I know there's like the New York pizzas have those gigantic like super peps

2295
04:03:14,100 --> 04:03:19,079
I like just a standard a standard pepperoni. That's what that's where we're at. Yeah

2296
04:03:19,280 --> 04:03:21,639
Hey

2297
04:03:22,200 --> 04:03:27,399
Yo, that's what I'm talking about. You want to get that extra dining table or up? Let's upgrade wait

2298
04:03:27,399 --> 04:03:32,229
I feel like that's what was our sink situation. Oh, we know we don't actually have the research

2299
04:03:32,309 --> 04:03:41,959
No, we need a table. Let's get that table by that table. Didn't we have one what happened to it? We couldn't afford it

2300
04:03:43,489 --> 04:03:46,489
Shit, we didn't why why do we keep the sink in here?

2301
04:03:47,139 --> 04:03:52,120
Because we get to keep the upgrade across like you still have to buy the sink

2302
04:03:52,159 --> 04:03:57,799
We want a better sink, but this is the best sink and we have to live with it is not the best sink

2303
04:03:58,420 --> 04:04:02,149
Okay, you're right. Just reroll. We

2304
04:04:03,110 --> 04:04:10,479
Only have $30. All right. I forgot I named the restaurant that and I was if I got like got taken aback for a second

2305
04:04:10,479 --> 04:04:14,040
I have I just I I didn't even notice that

2306
04:04:14,639 --> 04:04:30,680
What are you gonna order? Let him do it. Let him order a little more. Oh, he wants one single water

2307
04:04:30,680 --> 04:04:42,219
No, I could just have a water. Okay, and yeah, you're good. I cannot cut pizza. I cannot reach it from here

2308
04:04:42,219 --> 04:04:46,819
I know I'm thinking wouldn't it be funny if like we had his pizza ready and we could give it to him right now

2309
04:04:46,819 --> 04:04:56,000
But we like made him wait and you're like sitting there at your table and you're wondering like where's my food? I

2310
04:04:57,379 --> 04:05:03,819
Can see that there's a pizza back there. I'm telling you right now. I I do not like this whole setup

2311
04:05:03,819 --> 04:05:07,520
I hate it. This is absolutely hate it. This is ending at

2312
04:05:08,159 --> 04:05:10,590
day like six

2313
04:05:10,590 --> 04:05:29,389
Space is so important and we just don't have any

2314
04:05:29,909 --> 04:05:44,899
Especially with all the plates, but we will make it. What are we gonna do about it complain over and over again until

2315
04:05:45,420 --> 04:05:52,700
We decide to stop playing. I was looking for like a practical. How do we arrange this?

2316
04:05:53,180 --> 04:05:58,350
If the sink is the problem

2317
04:05:58,670 --> 04:06:03,659
Mm-hmm chips messes are created in a well, that's awful

2318
04:06:03,940 --> 04:06:09,680
Let's go to make but because you have to make these I'm the chef

2319
04:06:10,239 --> 04:06:18,030
Pizza and chips chopped potatoes and oh you have to actually cook them you can just empty like a bag of

2320
04:06:18,389 --> 04:06:27,180
Lays or something into like a like a bowl. What am I cooking them in? Hey, here we go research oven research desk

2321
04:06:27,459 --> 04:06:40,440
Alright, the sink is in here right now. Yeah, is it like chips like oh chips or is it right?

2322
04:06:40,440 --> 04:06:50,000
Like potato chips potato chips, so it's potato chips not chips like fries not not chocolate chips

2323
04:06:50,239 --> 04:06:55,379
It's crisps is it crisps or chips it is for I don't know man. I think this is an English game

2324
04:06:55,459 --> 04:06:59,559
Yes, I'm I putting it in the oven. I'm just taking potatoes and putting them in the oven

2325
04:06:59,559 --> 04:07:05,399
I'm chopping potatoes and ovening them. I guess okay, then I am

2326
04:07:06,040 --> 04:07:09,680
ready

2327
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:36,590
Research we want the sink in there, right? I like I like that word crisps crisps. He wants pizza and crisps Betty does

2328
04:07:52,610 --> 04:07:58,909
Don't hope you don't want chips. Oh he does it's a baked potato

2329
04:07:59,229 --> 04:08:07,270
Sorry, we forgot to cut your fries and we baked the whole potato. Here you go

2330
04:08:23,209 --> 04:08:27,270
We want one cheese one cheese and crying fries

2331
04:08:27,270 --> 04:08:36,129
I'm not what I've stopped saying it one cheese. And are you fucking me? I

2332
04:08:41,209 --> 04:08:46,610
Know why can't you just pick it up and put it on the other plate? No

2333
04:08:48,920 --> 04:08:58,600
We want just two cheese nothing else. They're gonna make a whole other pizza. So this is uh, I think you got time

2334
04:08:59,079 --> 04:09:06,399
This is looking a little dicey. No, you're good. Hey waitin we picked didn't we pick like comfy they don't care

2335
04:09:07,799 --> 04:09:16,360
That's just scared this fucking shit. I mean scared me too. What happened to I don't understand what I don't what I don't get

2336
04:09:16,360 --> 04:09:19,319

2337
04:09:20,719 --> 04:09:22,719

2338
04:09:25,129 --> 04:09:27,549
So now we're fucked now we are fucked

2339
04:09:29,489 --> 04:09:31,489
Instantly just like boom gone

2340
04:09:32,579 --> 04:09:44,270
You throw a whole piece into the trash, oh my god

2341
04:09:45,069 --> 04:09:47,469
Pete's my mic, which is hard to do. I

2342
04:09:48,309 --> 04:09:55,469
It's not okay. Okay that really I'm moving that garbage this whole kitchen. I like it

2343
04:10:00,030 --> 04:10:06,139
Bat flu in your room swoop down and try to bite you on the neck

2344
04:10:06,700 --> 04:10:09,879
Oh

2345
04:10:09,879 --> 04:10:20,040
Compromise from the chef here. Can we like next guy who comes in we give them the trash bag

2346
04:10:20,500 --> 04:10:28,379
There I saw this meme video like this tick-tock video one time this lady

2347
04:10:28,819 --> 04:10:34,100
He was she was at a restaurant back in the kitchen. She was balancing for somebody

2348
04:10:34,100 --> 04:10:37,899
she was trying to hold five different old dinners and she was

2349
04:10:38,659 --> 04:10:40,659
balancing them on a trash can and

2350
04:10:41,059 --> 04:10:45,610
She moved a little too much in five full plates of dinner

2351
04:10:45,930 --> 04:10:48,290
Just went to right into the trash

2352
04:10:49,219 --> 04:10:56,569
It's awful. It's such a sad video every single one goes in the trash and she just goes

2353
04:10:58,209 --> 04:11:00,209
It I feel it

2354
04:11:01,690 --> 04:11:11,309
We're gonna upgrade that sink again power. What does it wait power sink?

2355
04:11:11,309 --> 04:11:18,829
I don't know speed but cannot provide water power jet. We put it in there again

2356
04:11:19,069 --> 04:11:26,420
Yeah, well that thing cook will it turn into a dishwasher eventually and can we I think the next one is the dishwasher

2357
04:11:27,260 --> 04:11:35,729
Did you get the work boots? I didn't I might want to buy the plates and buying the plates

2358
04:11:35,930 --> 04:11:45,579
I'm gonna say this clip pizza eviscerated it. I didn't even see you do it

2359
04:11:46,620 --> 04:11:51,020
It was such a clean like I want that to step through the step five ready to put it boom

2360
04:11:51,299 --> 04:11:56,870
Let's see. I think you got time. Just look at a little dicey. No, you're good. Hey waiting

2361
04:11:56,870 --> 04:12:00,739
We picked didn't we pick like comfy they don't care

2362
04:12:09,579 --> 04:12:16,290
I was gonna say yeah, definitely move the trash. Yeah, I put the trash out with you

2363
04:12:16,649 --> 04:12:27,780
So you guys can relate? I am ready ready. Come on

2364
04:12:40,219 --> 04:12:43,299
They want pizza. I

2365
04:12:43,659 --> 04:12:50,659
Don't know why it's funny, but I like the way you said it. It sounded like disappointed

2366
04:12:50,659 --> 04:12:59,090
Oh, they're pizza and they just order something else. This can't what anything else burger or something

2367
04:12:59,610 --> 04:13:35,739
Pizza pizza only pizza ever another day another pizza pizza. I can't reach that one. It's common

2368
04:13:35,819 --> 04:13:47,840
Can you please tell them our company slogan I said

2369
04:13:47,840 --> 04:13:52,159
Can you think you could use your influence to get Costco to bring back the pizza combo?

2370
04:13:52,200 --> 04:13:59,190
Can you talk? Can you take the order? Oh, you don't even have to you don't even have to wash

2371
04:14:01,110 --> 04:14:03,540
We need one cheese one cheese and fry

2372
04:14:07,280 --> 04:14:16,389
Influence order up the influence that I would have on a company like Costco is your equivalent of me

2373
04:14:16,989 --> 04:14:26,139
Like showing up with like three people and we're all in like clown outfits, it's I don't not very much

2374
04:14:26,379 --> 04:14:32,719
You're just ignoring customers. I'm doing a funny little bit man. You're like on your phone

2375
04:14:32,719 --> 04:14:37,399
There's a customer right next to you and he like knows you can serve him and he's just like side-eyeing you and you're like

2376
04:14:38,399 --> 04:14:41,360
Watching like a tick-tock. I mean we would get the attention, right?

2377
04:14:41,360 --> 04:14:47,559
Like if three people in clown costumes had a meeting with the Costco representatives, it would be like oh we would get there

2378
04:14:47,559 --> 04:14:51,559
It would be like attention-grabbing, but they'd be like, okay and I'll get the fuck out of here you you clown

2379
04:14:52,360 --> 04:15:05,750
Take their order already take their order guys. They're ordering pizza. He knows what to make

2380
04:15:06,709 --> 04:15:11,559
What am I doing? There's too many plates in that rack

2381
04:15:12,280 --> 04:15:23,510
Looks like we got three left over if you want to share a bite go my pie

2382
04:15:24,190 --> 04:15:29,709
Again, you're back there and you're just being a weird guy. I'm the I'll be a weird guy no matter where I am

2383
04:15:29,829 --> 04:15:31,829
All right affordable or charming

2384
04:15:32,149 --> 04:15:34,450
Again, we have never done one of these

2385
04:15:34,969 --> 04:15:41,559
So what okay affordable focus to serve as quickly as possible

2386
04:15:42,200 --> 04:15:44,680
So eventually they have decreased eating time

2387
04:15:45,200 --> 04:15:53,149
Haves the time but no, what'd you pick? You picked the right one? You were already on the right? Oh, I was reading

2388
04:15:53,149 --> 04:15:58,520
Oh sure you were water basin a water

2389
04:15:59,000 --> 04:16:03,200
Basin you want the water base when you want to wait again for the washer

2390
04:16:03,200 --> 04:16:08,639
I like the water basin the water basin. I think is immediate, but what do we do with the super sink?

2391
04:16:10,280 --> 04:16:20,090
Um, it's like in here in case like something no the trash is causing customers to be upset

2392
04:16:20,090 --> 04:16:25,299
I think yeah, it can't be up here. Is it? Yep. See they look at the stinky fish thing

2393
04:16:25,299 --> 04:16:34,639
Oh, we lose a money dog. Okay, so it's gotta have to be somewhere up here. Yeah, put in

So this is a so this is the one we want. What about a plant? Oh, that's expensive expensive plant. I'm gonna sneeze fine

2396
04:16:55,680 --> 04:17:00,680
I hate that more than anything. I thought about it too much. Oh that angry. I

2397
04:17:03,639 --> 04:17:17,649
Hate that more than anything. You can use a barrel as a counter when we need money. He spent it all. Can you I think so?

2398
04:17:17,770 --> 04:17:32,639
That's awesome. Then cuz it counts as a decoration. Okay, let's go. We got no money. We're poor. We're good art making the dough

2399
04:17:32,639 --> 04:17:39,420
Come on. It's 8 a.m. Okay. I am doing it. I am doing it. I am doing it. I'm sorry boss

2402
04:18:09,000 --> 04:18:17,780
This is bad. We need to pivot here. Okay. Where are you? Just this book? No, they can't have that take that's not yours

2403
04:18:17,899 --> 04:18:39,879
Hey, can we have someone handle that customer the way on the left someone handle that guy? You see I am working

2404
04:18:39,879 --> 04:18:47,709
Okay, I just hate to see a customer neglect it at the fuck you customer leave pizzeria

2405
04:18:48,190 --> 04:19:36,399
Fuck you customer leave put a nice place need a slice. I can't reach it need a slice on here. No

2406
04:19:37,200 --> 04:19:45,040
I need a fry. I blew it. It's over. I fucked everything up. I it's over. It might not be put it on there

2407
04:19:48,000 --> 04:20:03,530
Thanks for coming and make sure to give us a nice review on Google. Yeah, this saw this center this sucks

2408
04:20:03,610 --> 04:20:13,709
We're still fine, man

2409
04:20:13,750 --> 04:20:16,659
It's a good thing I have cat like reflexes

2410
04:20:20,590 --> 04:20:25,239
When he said guys move everything to the left, please

2411
04:20:28,180 --> 04:20:36,430
On us to maximum group size. Let's do that. That's kind of interesting 200

2412
04:20:36,430 --> 04:20:42,879
It's it's better reward to and I think that's actually easier. So not that I know what experience well when you make a big pizza

2413
04:20:42,879 --> 04:20:48,079
It's because we're doing pizza. So that's actually here and no we're making the same amount of pizzas

2414
04:20:48,079 --> 04:20:54,139
And let's like four dudes want fries then I'm like then we're fucked. Yeah, but I mean you make one whole pizza

2415
04:20:54,139 --> 04:21:03,719
That's a whole table. How many slices it or five or four or it's been four provides oil oil

2416
04:21:04,040 --> 04:21:24,129
You could oil me up. I left the call. Okay. I

2417
04:21:27,370 --> 04:21:39,329
Wonder what the oil does and that makes sense that it's one for a plate and one for washing

2418
04:21:39,329 --> 04:21:44,569
Yes, I think everything you just said for the last few minutes. I completely agree with great

2419
04:21:44,690 --> 04:22:03,680
That's all that I asked. It's all that I asked. Are we good? Wait, what about an upgrade upgrade?

2420
04:22:04,360 --> 04:22:13,020
Everyone okay increases movement and prevents spills. We can upgrade this upgrade that I wonder what that does. Okay, let's go

2421
04:22:13,020 --> 04:22:27,379
I gotta be top of my game here. Yeah, you have this three people. Okay, what do they want? We're looking at

yeah do you eat it isn't that kind of what fast food restaurants do though

2477
04:30:28,079 --> 04:30:31,079
they make it and they put it under the warming lights I said just sit in there

2478
04:30:31,079 --> 04:30:34,600
for some difference in like these are warming lights we designed it for the

2479
04:30:34,600 --> 04:30:41,590
situation and it's on the barrel when he double pizza double fry yeah it's not

2480
04:30:41,590 --> 04:30:45,069
under a warming light it's just on it'd be like if it was just on the counter

2481
04:30:45,069 --> 04:30:53,079
it's true fucking I hate this thing what is that I'm in a situation what did you

2482
04:30:53,079 --> 04:30:56,639
just like the chart I'm in a situation how can I help how can I help how can I

2483
04:30:56,639 --> 04:31:05,459

2485
04:31:16,350 --> 04:31:20,750
door and then take out the thing it's like and I fucked up and I burned it

2486
04:31:20,750 --> 04:31:29,920
what if the barrel is heated it's not it has like a cobweb on it that would be

2487
04:31:29,920 --> 04:31:45,180
dangerous somebody said this game has two buttons yeah but this it could be

2488
04:31:45,180 --> 04:31:48,180
either one you never know yeah you know what else what other game has two

2489
04:31:48,180 --> 04:32:05,809
buttons like Dark Souls dodge and swing got you there wrong oh look at that shit

2490
04:32:05,809 --> 04:32:13,879
what is it extortion customers pay 50% more to use our fancy table we're gonna

2491
04:32:13,879 --> 04:32:20,319
be millionaires how much does it cost fancy 60 I mean let's get it we need

2492
04:32:20,319 --> 04:32:23,719
another table we I can't we just put it on one of our taste we have already I

2493
04:32:23,719 --> 04:32:31,219
think it's like a whole extra table oh let's just let's get it yeah get it do

2494
04:32:31,219 --> 04:32:37,079
it do it do it do it do it do it you you kind of did one of the only one

2495
04:32:37,079 --> 04:32:43,920
person should be over here doing this you're doing it you're doing great this

2496
04:32:43,920 --> 04:32:56,159
is gonna be interesting I think we have to get rid of one of these no I can

2497
04:32:56,159 --> 04:33:01,569
swing this you can swing that I guess can I swing this you think what if you

2498
04:33:01,569 --> 04:33:06,290
put one of the tables in the extra room oh wait a minute I can do that wait wait

2499
04:33:06,290 --> 04:33:10,490
wait wait wait wait I can just put them right next with zero people can sit

2500
04:33:10,490 --> 04:33:17,970
here I'm saying like what if we do a secret if I can only zero people sit

2501
04:33:17,970 --> 04:33:43,759
here okay you come to both where the barrel is yeah I think they go to barrel

2502
04:33:43,759 --> 04:33:49,340
I think so I think this is okay by the larger table need it we need we need

2503
04:33:49,340 --> 04:33:53,099
bigger tables because expect the group sizes are for people are saying big

2504
04:33:53,099 --> 04:34:03,599
portion are people people are also saying the fancy table should have four

2505
04:34:03,599 --> 04:34:10,220
yeah because it's the fancy table and they pay more money but what would the

2506
04:34:10,220 --> 04:34:17,900
portion are due for us hey I think this is okay the barrel back here that sounds

2507
04:34:17,900 --> 04:34:24,520
like a to me it slices the pizza for you it slices the pizza for you

2508
04:34:24,520 --> 04:34:32,220
autocuts the pizza read chat I'm trying it's a fast chat room right now I just

2509
04:34:32,220 --> 04:34:37,619
look so do I make this the portioner and then you can grab the pizza off of it I

2510
04:34:37,619 --> 04:34:44,119
don't know how it worked should we practice it yes we're pretty high we're

2511
04:34:44,119 --> 04:34:51,119
high I don't want to mess this up on yeah it's a portioner okay give it a try

2512
04:34:51,119 --> 04:34:59,299
we just make my 400th pizza today just leave pizza on the table from when they

2513
04:34:59,299 --> 04:35:04,419
come in unfortunately not how the game works unfortunately I do agree with you

2514
04:35:04,419 --> 04:35:23,389
though so well how does this work how is this any different than what it was

2515
04:35:23,389 --> 04:35:38,580
before isn't this just the same thing make it face a counter oh oh we gotta

2516
04:35:38,580 --> 04:35:52,150
restart the plates on the arrow side I think I understand I think I understand

2517
04:35:52,150 --> 04:36:13,470
oh okay like that I put the pizza here or the other way the way it was no no

2518
04:36:13,470 --> 04:36:23,240
you're the gamer I don't know I'm not a gamer I think it's like that let's try

2519
04:36:23,240 --> 04:36:43,790
it well don't start the day let's practice it I feel like I feel like I

2520
04:36:43,790 --> 04:37:01,799
can really just run my own business after this the other way it's upset why

2521
04:37:01,799 --> 04:37:08,810
is it upside down wait don't oh it's slicing it and then putting it there

2522
04:37:08,810 --> 04:37:23,630
that kind of doesn't even seem that helpful it's only cuts one at a time I

2523
04:37:23,630 --> 04:37:32,729
mean if we if we put it in the back I don't want to have it in the front of

2524
04:37:32,729 --> 04:37:37,639
the restaurant taking up the counter space so wait I'm confused what's

2525
04:37:37,639 --> 04:37:59,220
happening here basically exit exit wait I like wrapping my head around keyboard

2526
04:37:59,220 --> 04:38:06,020
looker Andy yeah I stir do you do the home row typing or do you look down at

2527
04:38:06,020 --> 04:38:09,139
your hands like I've never learned it was horrible to learn that it made me

2528
04:38:09,139 --> 04:38:18,659
like physically ill look wait wait I'm I'm like I've been playing too long I've

2529
04:38:18,659 --> 04:38:29,840
been up too long I'm getting mind-fucked by this really simple interaction yeah

2530
04:38:29,840 --> 04:38:35,950
so yeah and when you when you put your hands on the home row do you do you type

2531
04:38:35,950 --> 04:38:38,590
looking down at your hands or have you memorized where all the keys are you

2532
04:38:38,590 --> 04:38:43,979
know if you look down I don't have to look down at my hands we had type in

2533
04:38:43,979 --> 04:38:47,580
class in school and I was very fast typer and I enjoyed learning how to type

2534
04:38:47,580 --> 04:38:51,380
and being becoming a faster typer because I would play Starcraft and then

2535
04:38:51,380 --> 04:38:55,139
if someone typed to me in Starcraft like I can't stop for like a full minute to

2536
04:38:55,139 --> 04:39:00,700
type I would have to learn how to type quick that was all one sentence yeah

2537
04:39:00,700 --> 04:39:09,009
okay so but do you do ASDF JKL semi and do the home row or do you just know

2538
04:39:09,009 --> 04:39:13,330
where how do you what's your placement for your hands where are the the

2539
04:39:13,330 --> 04:39:18,009
freaking the knobs are on the the J and the F you put your index fingers on

2540
04:39:18,009 --> 04:39:22,259
those yeah like that's called see you don't call me role placement okay yeah

2541
04:39:22,259 --> 04:39:25,700
you don't have to look down you just know there that where that is how else

2542
04:39:25,700 --> 04:39:28,220
would you place your hand on a keyboard but you have a you have a mechanical

2543
04:39:28,220 --> 04:39:34,500
keyboard right yeah whenever I do that I feel like I get stuck moving my fingers

2544
04:39:34,500 --> 04:39:39,779
around I feel like I get kind of trapped in between the little divots you know

2545
04:39:39,779 --> 04:39:45,830
I mean like it then I press the wrong things well I don't understand your

2546
04:39:45,830 --> 04:39:49,990
problem because if you play Diablo 2 and you need to use your potions on one two

2547
04:39:49,990 --> 04:39:54,110
three four then you can also just easily go from WASD and all the buttons that

2548
04:39:54,110 --> 04:39:57,270
you need up to one fours and you learn how to do the numbers as well I can do

2549
04:39:57,270 --> 04:40:00,430
hands are always in the right spot I can do WASD without looking one two three

2550
04:40:00,430 --> 04:40:05,380
four space control I can do pretty much it's just needing to go to like type

2551
04:40:05,380 --> 04:40:12,630
words right so W1234 WASD Q ERT is everything over here right is fine I

2552
04:40:12,630 --> 04:40:21,259
don't need to look but the issue is going from pressing J to E to like B to

2553
04:40:21,939 --> 04:40:25,819
other sides of the board that's the problem that's what I mean like is it

2554
04:40:25,819 --> 04:40:30,619
like a brain issue or a keyboard issue it's a brain issue because I have what

2555
04:40:30,619 --> 04:40:35,959
I'm talking about is trying this same problem if you try and write on paper

2556
04:40:35,959 --> 04:40:44,250
but no I could write on I could write on paper without looking but I could you

2557
04:40:44,250 --> 04:40:47,369
just write my name without looking that's so you know where all the numbers

2558
04:40:47,369 --> 04:40:52,250
and letters are on the keyboard but when you try and form a word my fingers can't

2559
04:40:52,250 --> 04:40:58,180
find them because I have never locked into complete muscle memory the exact

2560
04:40:58,180 --> 04:41:02,459
spacing for all the letters on the keyboard can you can you boot up like

2561
04:41:02,459 --> 04:41:09,360
type racer comm right now I mean I would I wouldn't be able to do it I would love

2562
04:41:09,360 --> 04:41:15,229
to see that I would love to see you look straight ahead into the camera and not

2563
04:41:15,229 --> 04:41:24,409
look down at your hands and play type racer can I rain check this I'm tired I

2564
04:41:24,409 --> 04:41:31,430
feel like it's not that big of a deal I'm tired though I if it's gonna be

2565
04:41:31,430 --> 04:41:37,529
awful well isn't that what everyone wants to see let me drink like a coffee

2566
04:41:37,529 --> 04:41:45,740
let me eat a piece of salmon and drink a coffee like an espresso and get a full

2567
04:41:45,740 --> 04:41:55,099
eight hours of sleep okay okay rain check on the type racer yes don't worry

2568
04:41:55,099 --> 04:41:59,580
I'll tell you I will follow up on we're gonna play Elden Ring co-op anyways so I

2569
04:41:59,580 --> 04:42:04,349
mean you we could start with that okay I'm gonna eat a piece of salmon I want

2570
04:42:04,349 --> 04:42:08,060
to eat spinach and shit I want to have like an espresso and I want to have

2571
04:42:08,060 --> 04:42:13,529
simple eight hours sleep do you really need to rest up for this like triathlon

2572
04:42:13,529 --> 04:42:23,330
you're gonna run you're a coward I know you can say that they can and they are

2573
04:42:23,330 --> 04:42:29,150
I'm just honestly I'm just like too lazy to just minimize this winter I think

2574
04:42:29,150 --> 04:42:34,459
that's what's going on here but like you just it's just minimizing a game that

2575
04:42:34,459 --> 04:42:37,139
you're barely paying attention to at this point we're gonna lose the next

2576
04:42:37,139 --> 04:42:40,439
mission cuz I like started talking to you and you've had a conversation the

2577
04:42:40,439 --> 04:42:43,740
last one and this is the problem right what look at we're doing pretty good if

2578
04:42:43,740 --> 04:42:48,340
we disappear out to do it like type racer we're gonna come back we're gonna

2579
04:42:48,340 --> 04:42:51,500
be rusty and it's gonna be all I think it's already beyond the point where like

2580
04:42:51,500 --> 04:43:03,750
that's gonna happen there was just like me I'm really concerned for this next

2581
04:43:03,750 --> 04:43:08,950
day we're gonna be fine stop I don't know how the fuck this thing works well

2582
04:43:08,950 --> 04:43:18,340
why I'm using why did we buy it let's start okay it's just like me just pay

2583
04:43:18,340 --> 04:43:22,479
attention but we have to at least get further than we ever have I think of

2584
04:43:22,479 --> 04:43:28,270
us already is not yet think we have one more all right pizza pizza pizza that's

2635
04:52:48,639 --> 04:52:51,799
these fucks please put the portioner next to the sink before I blow a

2636
04:52:51,799 --> 04:52:59,900
gasket that what he said I think that I might be it's that was close enough it

2637
04:52:59,900 --> 04:53:13,229
was something like that okay we have a lot of things going on here rug we have

2638
04:53:13,229 --> 04:53:16,509
a lot of money we should put some decorations we haven't done any

2639
04:53:16,509 --> 04:53:29,130
upgrades what case plant put a rug down all right I'm buying a rug yeah we have

2640
04:53:29,130 --> 04:53:33,009
patience if we get a decorations down Christmas tree you all you want a

2641
04:53:33,009 --> 04:53:43,540
Christmas tree I'll buy another rug here's a highly flammable rug okay so

2642
04:53:43,540 --> 04:53:52,409
now we have patience increased cabinet can the rugs not go under the tables

2643
04:53:52,409 --> 04:54:10,409
metal table 50% less food and I think they order less but they have less

2644
04:54:10,409 --> 04:54:16,900
patience hmm sides are optional oh you don't have to put fries on their plate

2645
04:54:16,900 --> 04:54:24,740
so you could actually just not put french fries in front of them that's

2646
04:54:24,740 --> 04:54:38,759
actually kind of good I don't know what do you think you want to be faster you

2647
04:54:38,759 --> 04:54:51,619
put the sink next to the oil you can skip the rolling dough step I'm still

2648
04:54:51,619 --> 04:55:10,990
confused the oil in the sink yeah we don't have a normal sink anymore bro

2649
04:55:10,990 --> 04:55:18,939
move the portioner there's a lot of negative comments coming in to you it

2650
04:55:19,020 --> 04:55:23,659
was I saw someone to do like the face nice my child are saying that that's

2651
04:55:23,659 --> 04:55:29,630
like a glitch that's like an exploit we're getting that oh wait why what did

2652
04:55:29,630 --> 04:55:35,299
I say you know that email where it goes oh yeah but what's what's the problem

2653
04:55:35,299 --> 04:55:39,750
with me they're saying that that's too far away from the sink what's too far

2654
04:55:39,750 --> 04:55:43,830
away from the sink the portioner apparently that should be next to the

2655
04:55:43,830 --> 04:55:51,240
sink why I don't understand portioner above the barrel so it puts the puts

2656
04:55:51,240 --> 04:55:53,939
the pieces over so I can grab them what just happened

2657
04:55:53,979 --> 04:55:59,669
oh that hurt what happened to me what just happened to me it goes closer to

2658
04:55:59,669 --> 04:56:02,590
the barrel so then it puts the portioned food in front of me so I can

2659
04:56:02,590 --> 04:56:13,180
take it that they want that so I put the pizza here and it goes over and then

2660
04:56:13,180 --> 04:56:17,229
you get the pizza and you put the put on the plate I think that's how it works I

2661
04:56:17,229 --> 04:56:25,069
like bumped my headphone here and it went in my ear yes yes yes finally yes

2662
04:56:25,069 --> 04:56:30,110
yes that works yes but also some people said no stop sending psychic waves to

2663
04:56:30,669 --> 04:56:40,540
next to the sink oh my god these instructions let me read this upside

2664
04:56:40,540 --> 04:56:45,459
down t-shape next to sink with counter but pizza so it goes down just practice

2665
04:56:45,459 --> 04:56:49,180
it so we can see what this does we're way too far to have this be messed up

2666
04:56:49,180 --> 04:56:56,659
what does that mean what are these words what's the upside down t-shape I'm

2667
04:56:56,659 --> 04:57:33,500
getting a Christmas tree I feel like we were doing fine you're doing fine Chad

2668
04:57:33,500 --> 04:57:40,720
is just trying very hard drum up mm-hmm every pizza I make yeah it's going in

2669
04:57:40,720 --> 04:57:50,400
the trash why we're doing don't do that all right I'm ready I'm super happy with

2670
04:57:50,400 --> 04:57:54,680
what we have you it's getting over complicated by like too many cooks in

2671
04:57:54,680 --> 04:57:58,220
the kitchen right now there's also too many chairs in the kitchen

2672
04:57:58,220 --> 04:58:17,319
can we do an outside seating sure we can handle it we've handled it before all

2673
04:58:17,319 --> 04:58:20,400
right just go for it pizza that's all you didn't need to do your master of it

2674
04:58:20,400 --> 04:58:24,240
you know it you know the sauce you know the ingredients of the cheese mozzarella

2675
04:58:24,240 --> 04:58:34,419
I do I'm glad that I'm getting some of the fucking respect that I deserve you

2676
04:58:34,419 --> 04:58:39,619
got that you can plate those yeah but now I see what people mean okay well

2677
04:58:39,619 --> 04:58:50,979
then you're gonna have to set it up next time cuz I am dense fucking granite all

2678
04:58:50,979 --> 04:58:56,139

2688
05:00:45,340 --> 05:01:04,279

2690
05:01:11,419 --> 05:01:32,029
got that right here this is not what the bug doctor prescribed whatever happened

2691
05:01:32,069 --> 05:01:35,549
just good old-fashioned home cooking or like you don't have to worry about these

2692
05:01:35,549 --> 05:01:50,479
like conveyor belts and auto plating Alexa make me a pizza please I can't

2693
05:01:50,479 --> 05:02:03,430
reach that uh that is a huge knife that's actually scary I think we're

2694
05:02:03,430 --> 05:02:08,470
actually gonna beat this I think so too I think I hate it that whole layout I

2695
05:02:08,470 --> 05:02:12,110
was really happy with what it was before I was really content to just move my

2696
05:02:12,110 --> 05:02:15,819
pizzas around myself you get a little hands-on with the dough you can really

2697
05:02:15,819 --> 05:02:19,259
feel it you know it's like a rustic kind of like connection to the food now

2698
05:02:19,259 --> 05:02:27,080
actually put the portion of the sink make sure it's facing the right way

2699
05:02:27,080 --> 05:02:36,650
because now I can just go like much easier okay and then and then what if it

2700
05:02:36,650 --> 05:02:40,740
goes too fast and it shoots straight into the sink and that will be a funny

2701
05:02:40,740 --> 05:02:47,709
LOL moment because we're at the end of the game okay and what it okay here's

2702
05:02:47,709 --> 05:02:53,720
the legitimate serious I'm not messing around what if okay I put a pizza here

2703
05:02:53,720 --> 05:02:57,419
it shoots over a slice here it's shooting and it's gonna shoot a slice

2704
05:02:57,419 --> 05:03:01,380
that I can grab and put it on the plate immediately you you need a French fry

2705
05:03:01,380 --> 05:03:07,590
let's where do I where do I put where do I put the French fry that's what the

2706
05:03:07,590 --> 05:03:33,340
practice is for mmm you can put plates on top of the portioner ah so then would

2707
05:03:33,340 --> 05:03:42,639
you load it with a bunch no no okay wait wait here I just want to explain what

2708
05:03:42,639 --> 05:03:48,049
I'm talking about so I only grab this don't go crazy put pizza down pizza goes

2709
05:03:48,049 --> 05:03:54,360
onto the plate boink next piece is ready okay so now that's when when when we

2710
05:03:54,360 --> 05:04:01,939
need a French fry okay are you then waiting for me to put a plate down I

2711
05:04:01,939 --> 05:04:06,700
would need you to put the I put a plate down can you that works no that's okay

2712
05:04:06,700 --> 05:04:10,979
then am I making french fries to order then like if what if two french fries

2713
05:04:10,979 --> 05:04:14,459
are coming up and I could plate down over here you'd have to put one down

2714
05:04:14,459 --> 05:04:19,259
over there but sink in corner never and not on a plate just don't put it on

2715
05:04:19,259 --> 05:04:26,860
anything just put it just on the ground okay I'm I'm good I'm good I'm good are

2716
05:04:26,860 --> 05:04:37,990
you good I yeah yeah yeah go go go go go go but this is it this is a change this

2717
05:04:37,990 --> 05:04:42,869
is a change but you changed it I did change it what and why is this changing

2718
05:04:42,869 --> 05:04:48,270
again because it is you understand that it's harder for me to like go diagonal

2719
05:04:48,270 --> 05:04:52,549
and put stuff in the sink though why because it's like it's it's a kind of a

2720
05:04:52,549 --> 05:04:54,990
finicky little spot it's a tiny it's like two or three Frank it's like two

2721
05:04:55,150 --> 05:04:58,869
you already had to do that before to grab the plates yeah but it's so much

2722
05:04:58,869 --> 05:05:03,709
easier for me to scope a boom but like does this thing automatically plate

2723
05:05:03,709 --> 05:05:22,490
things if the plates are there I don't like it I don't like it see do you see

2724
05:05:22,490 --> 05:05:26,770
what's going on right now it's cuz there's a little area I'm playing on

2725
05:05:26,770 --> 05:05:32,069
this member I have control on an issue for me I'm playing controller so I have

2726
05:05:32,069 --> 05:05:41,240
like a tiny little window here let's go for it we're good rotate the potion so

2727
05:05:41,240 --> 05:05:46,819
it takes the pizza from above and not the right oh dude yeah what that's

2728
05:05:46,819 --> 05:05:54,229
exactly what should be happening cuz then no okay so you want to put the

2729
05:05:54,229 --> 05:06:00,639
portion or it's a yeah I get it so you can put that you can put pizzas there so

2730
05:06:00,639 --> 05:06:10,790

05:11:40,049 --> 05:11:47,069
don't think it matters anymore we have so much money it's really just like can

2768
05:11:47,069 --> 05:11:52,360
we finish yeah we still mean we have three levels to do so we need to make

2769
05:11:52,360 --> 05:11:58,090
sure we did this right we have this service thing we don't need we haven't

2770
05:11:58,090 --> 05:12:06,630
used this one time honestly we could get rid of the research I don't think we

2771
05:12:06,630 --> 05:12:11,150
know this whole room out yeah make it I'll move the freezer and everything in

2772
05:12:11,150 --> 05:12:14,950
the kitchen this is this is the expensive private dining area right this

2773
05:12:14,950 --> 05:12:18,069
is a way you just use this extra money for this table yeah that's where you go

2774
05:12:18,069 --> 05:12:26,380
to like really be in a kitchen room that gives me more room here too so that's

2775
05:12:26,380 --> 05:12:36,509
good the trash do we even use the trash really seats to oh this is a table

2776
05:12:36,509 --> 05:12:43,430
customers share but they eat longer because it's romantic we just use them

2777
05:12:43,430 --> 05:12:51,540
replace this three I think two fours like we still can have a group of two

2778
05:12:51,540 --> 05:12:57,259
show up I don't know if we can fit it anywhere we should put the tablecloth on

2779
05:12:57,259 --> 05:13:03,799
one is what people are saying we have one with a tablecloth no this is the

2780
05:13:03,799 --> 05:13:08,860
table table simple cloth it's like a it's like a whole two table napkins

2781
05:13:08,860 --> 05:13:14,659
prevent mess when you put it on a table just spend our money yeah we have so

2782
05:13:14,659 --> 05:13:23,069
much money okay but you have to actually I mean can eyes the very beginning just

2838
05:22:39,560 --> 05:22:45,259
hours um is there decorations because if we could really use the last two if

2842
05:23:32,740 --> 05:23:37,360
you could like chop four potatoes and put them on that I think that's cool but

2843
05:23:37,360 --> 05:23:41,400
you've just added a variable in the last level just be careful yeah it's a space

2844
05:23:41,439 --> 05:23:54,740
I didn't need okay maybe you can't reroll yeah I don't think you can reroll

2845

2866
05:28:47,150 --> 05:29:03,060
no no you never make another pizza for the rest of your life five-star restaurant we did

2867
05:29:03,060 --> 05:29:09,700
a five-star man I'm a five-star man when you complete this run you'll be able to

2868
05:29:09,700 --> 05:29:13,540
convert three of your cards into a franchise and continue in a new location

2869
05:29:13,540 --> 05:29:21,439
they really got us capitalism really got us we just beat the ball we're off the

2870
05:29:21,439 --> 05:29:28,209
train chopped off her flower pots or 50% chance that blueprints can be purchased

2871
05:29:28,209 --> 05:29:36,099
again I mean if we I think we're done I mean we're done but let's just take the

2872
05:29:36,099 --> 05:29:40,080
flowers because we weren't getting decorations when we want them so what

2873
05:29:40,080 --> 05:29:46,740
happens now what happens now is I you probably dinner I think it's just like a

2874
05:29:46,740 --> 05:29:52,819
new game plus so you just go keep going oh you you go as many days over time day

2875
05:29:53,540 --> 05:30:04,509
I'm good I'm good well that was really fun yeah I like that was intense simple

2876
05:30:04,509 --> 05:30:09,389
yet intense enjoyable I could okay so with two people it's kind of manageable I

2877
05:30:09,389 --> 05:30:12,790
think with three or four people that's where this game becomes kind of a mess I

2878
05:30:12,790 --> 05:30:17,229
think it's harder the more people you have well I've never played like

2879
05:30:17,229 --> 05:30:21,310
overcooked either which I know a lot of people really like in this genre yeah

2880
05:30:21,310 --> 05:30:24,389
this is this is not this one looked on simple I like the idea this because it

2881
05:30:24,389 --> 05:30:29,200
was like a consistent one kitchen yeah could work in but overcooked after like

2882
05:30:29,200 --> 05:30:33,159
I enjoyed that a lot so maybe we could try it sometime no that's cool and we'll

2883
05:30:33,159 --> 05:30:39,619
um we'll figure out the Elden Ring thing that sounds fun yeah and you're gonna be

05:32:59,990 --> 05:33:03,110
keep an eye on the sauce like I said I it'll be Thursday or Friday but plan on

2904
05:33:03,110 --> 05:33:13,900

05:33:26,689 --> 05:33:45,209
see that through let me let me do that right now that guy's really fun it does

2908
05:33:45,209 --> 05:33:51,040
remind me of overcooked but it reminds me of overcooked but you know I don't

2909
05:33:51,040 --> 05:33:54,549
know I almost like it a little better than overcooked because overcooked is

2910
05:33:54,549 --> 05:33:59,150
more individual levels you know in increasing difficulty different

2911
05:33:59,150 --> 05:34:02,549
environments each level was a little different that felt like you were
