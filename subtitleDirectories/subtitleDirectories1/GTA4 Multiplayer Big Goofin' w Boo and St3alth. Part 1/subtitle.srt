1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:19,070
You can't change anything, dude. Hey! Don't you stab me. Did you just kill that guy and I killed you at the same time?

2
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,429
Yeah, I had to make sure that all- Alright, boo, what are you doing?

3
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:29,230
I'm being stealthy. There's a cop there. Oh god. Oh boy.

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:36,179
Alright, get all these people out of their cars. We're gonna make a barricade.

5
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:42,060
Hold on, am I wedged in between these two things?

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,060
Okay, never mind, get out of the car and go get another one.

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,060
So, hold on, is there already a police barricade right here?

8
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,359
Hold on, what are you-

9
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,049
I'm having a hard time figuring out how this works.

10
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,049
Alright, get out of the car, get out of your cars. We're gonna get behind- Oh my god.

11
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,049
Get behind- Everyone get behind the cars.

12
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,049
We don't have guns, we have pistols.

13
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,049
Attack. I have a saw knife.

14
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,049
I just got the saw knife.

15
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,049
Make a barricade with the cars so the police can't get to us. So, light them up.

16
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,049
Light them up like dominoes.

17
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,049
Okay. See where I am, see on the mini ramp where I am.

18
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,049
I have car. Who's this dead guy?

19
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,049
I just shot that guy in his face, he was being annoying.

20
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,049
Alright, well get out of the way, I'm gonna- You didn't shoot this person.

21
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,049
Dude. Hey!

22
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,219
Alright, so line them up like an army of cars. There we go.

23
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,219
Yeah, alright, we're good, good.

24
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:43,219
And instant three stars for shooting a cop in the head.

25
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,219
She was head punching.

26
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:49,219
Alright, we just need- Once we get in the middle here, we can really start to-

27
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,219
This is where it gets crazy.

28
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:55,219
Oh my god, I just found a fucking striker shotgun. Not even kidding.

29
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,459
Let's keep it, because we're gonna need it.

30
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,769
Alright. It's like a- Oh my god.

31
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:01,769
Ow.

32
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,769
Alright, alright, everyone get in between. Get in between, so we don't get in trouble here.

33
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,769
What kind of parking was that?

34
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,770
Oh hey, by the way, how do you get next to the car?

35
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,770
Hey, what are you doing? I'm trying to use that.

36
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,009
Q, Q, Q, Q.

37
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,009
I'm trying to use that, you idiot!

38
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,310
Oh my god, there's so many enemies.

39
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,310
Alright, let's do it.

40
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Oh my gosh.

41
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,310
I got shot in the grenade.

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,310
What? How did I die?

43
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,580
Wait, the bullets went through the car?

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,580
Look at all these freaking cops.

45
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,419
Oh, no, it's this guy with the shotgun.

46
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,419
The guy with the shotgun.

47
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,419
That asshole with the shotgun is dead.

48
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,419
There's like five cops right here.

49
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:50,680
Are you serious?

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,009
They're killing me so quickly.

51
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,009
No, we gotta get like in an alleyway.

52
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,009
Can you auto-aim?

53
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,009
I'm like kicking their ass.

54
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,009
Can you auto-aim? How do you get behind cover?

55
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,009
Pro-sniper.

56
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,009
Hey, baby.

57
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,009
You looking to go for a ride, sweetheart?

58
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,009
Dude, don't shoot the...

59
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:11,009
Oh my god.

60
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,009
Look at this mess of cops.

61
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,009
Get in. Get in the car.

62
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:22,189
Get in. Calm down.

63
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,189
Oh, this guy is not happy.

64
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,189
Look at that mess. Oh my god.

65
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,430
Oh, the music. Oh my god.

66
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,430
Hey, thanks for blowing out the tires.

67
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,430
That like really helped.

68
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,430
That really helped our escape.

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
Alright, boo, get in.

70
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,430
You want me to get...

71
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
It's two-seater.

72
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,430
Oh, is it?

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,430
No, you get in the back.

74
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,430
How do I turn the radio off?

75
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,430
There's no off.

76
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,430
Alright, let's go.

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,430
Oh, so we're gonna do drive-bys in this piece of shit.

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,430
Oh, by the way, you can thank MLC Stealth for shooting out the tires for fun.

79
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,430
I can't even drive this damn car.

80
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,430
Hey guys, I have like a story to tell you.

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,430
You ever hear the one about the guy that...

82
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,669
Oh my god.

83
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,669
I jumped out too.

84
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,669
Yeah, thanks. Ditch that stupid cop.

85
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:14,419
That's like playing Battlefield where they just ditch a helicopter mid-air.

86
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,420
We can get six to...

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Stealth, did you shoot the damn tire out?

88
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Yeah.

89
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
You son of a...

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,420
I did that the second you were about to get in that car.

91
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
Oh my god.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,420
What is with you? Don't shoot the tires. We need them.

93
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,420
I thought I shot both of them. Only that one.

94
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Alright, new plan.

95
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Can I shoot the tire from right here?

96
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
I don't know.

97
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Oh, that poor guy.

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh, grandma cleaners.

99
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Alright, well Stealth, you brought this on yourself.

100
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh no.

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,100
Oh, I landed in the water.

102
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
It didn't even work.

103
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
My guy jumped out the car and landed over the fence.

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Why did that not even work? That was stupid.

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Oh jeez.

106
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Alright, that's your punishment for shooting the tires out.

107
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
That is shotgun.

108
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Alright, what have we learned today?

109
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,100
We've learned that it's impossible to get six stars when you play with MLZ stealth.

110
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh fuck, here comes...

111
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,100
The coppers are coming again, I'm sniping them.

112
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Oh, you're back there, alright.

113
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Alright, good, this is actually a great spot.

114
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
This is a great spot.

115
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,959
This is a fantastic spot.

116
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,519
This thing's automatic, my god.

117
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,519
I hear a helicopter.

118
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,519
Yeah, that thing shoots really fast.

119
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,889
Oh, there's a lot of them.

120
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,889
That's the SWAT team right there.

121
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,889
Wow, I'm not even near you guys.

122
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:36,889
I'm running.

123
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:37,889
This thing's gonna explode.

124
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:38,889
Run! Get off!

125
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:40,889
No, why am I jumping on top of the car?

126
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,889
No!

127
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,319
Make a run for it.

128
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,319
Oh, I just barely got away from that.

129
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,649
Holy crap.

130
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,649
I've had a grenade launcher.

131
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,649
There's gonna be plenty of guys for you to snipe here in a second.

132
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,649
Hey, can you see those choppers up there?

133
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,649
I can.

134
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,649
Okay, just wait for me to...

135
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:02,779
Oh, I just got sniped.

136
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,779
Oh wait, let me get in that SWAT car too.

137
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,779
Oh wait, that's you.

138
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:07,779
Oh, wrong button.

139
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,779
Let's get in the SWAT car.

140
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,779
Yeah, as you climb in, you get body armor.

141
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,779
I got full body armor.

142
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:14,779
I can protect you guys.

143
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,779
I can't, there's choppers around me.

144
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,779
I have to shoot them.

145
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,779
This guy's like sandwiched.

146
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,779
This thing's gonna blow.

147
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,779
Hey, that thing right next to it's gonna blow.

148
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,779
That thing's gonna explode.

149
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,779
Run away!

150
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,019
Oh, it's intact.

151
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,019
It's intact.

152
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,019
Oh, my god.

153
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,610
There's so many people here.

154
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,610
Wanna see something cool?

155
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,610
Yeah, I do.

156
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,610
Okay.

157
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,610
Feast your eyes.

158
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,610
In three, two, one.

159
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,610
What did you just do?

160
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,610
Oh, my god!

161
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,610
You just blew them all up.

162
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,610
They're on the left.

163
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,610
Look at that guy flying.

164
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,610
Look at that guy flying.

165
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,610
Hold on, German, let me in.

166
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,610
Alright, get in.

167
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,610
I think you have to get in the back, Will.

168
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,610
Oh, is it still intact?

169
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,610
Yeah, this thing's ready to go, I think.

170
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,610
Can you get in?

171
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,610
Oh, yeah, hell yeah.

172
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,610
Now we are unstoppable, baby.

173
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,610
How are we gonna kill those melee godfors above us?

174
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,610
How do you switch weapons while on this thing?

175
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,779
I don't know.

176
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:20,779
I don't wanna press buttons.

177
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:24,339
You ram into them head on.

178
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,339
Oh, this guy.

179
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,339
Bad day for you, buddy.

180
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,339
Oh, that was epic.

181
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,779
Oh, you shoot out of the back?

182
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,779
Yeah, you cut right through, and I shot him up, and he kind of flipped the car.

183
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,779
Now he's on his back.

184
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,779
That's unfortunate.

185
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,779
Now, this thing is slow as shit.

186
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,910
I hope we see, like, I hope we railroad somebody straight ahead.

187
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,910
This would be so funny.

188
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,910
Oh, too bad we didn't get that guy.

189
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,600
Alright, so ready?

190
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Here's what we're gonna do.

191
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Break!

192
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
He's gonna ram right into the back of us.

193
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh, god, he's gonna hit me.

194
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,759
Oh, come on, you can't take all of the tech.

195
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,189
Yeah, I can't shoot these guys.

196
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,189
I can only shoot if they're, like, right to my right.

197
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,560
I wish we had, like, an ice cream truck.

198
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,889
Yee!

199
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,129
Oh, my god.

200
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,750
Um, you have to really piss them off for six stars, don't you?

201
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,750
Uh, yeah, I know, really.

202
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,750
Oh, my god, we've been at five stars lately.

203
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,930
Do you have, like, grenades or any Molotovs or anything?

204
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,930
I don't know how to change guns.

205
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,930
I have, like, a grenade launcher.

206
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,680
Cute.

207
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
How do you change guns?

208
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Oh, I have Molotovs.

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
What?

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
What just happened?

211
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
I got shot out.

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,679
You got shot out of the car?

213
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,860
Yeah, they shot me out.

214
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Oh, no.

215
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Oh, no.

216
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,860
I've lost my Molotovs.

217
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Oh, I spawned next to you.

218
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,860
I left you for dead.

219
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
What?

220
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
You left you for dead.

221
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
That's what you did.

222
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,480
No, I didn't.

223
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
I got this cruiser now.

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
I'm in the cruiser.

225
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,769
Oh, no, I'm not.

226
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:51,769
I'm flipping over.

227
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,769
Oh.

228
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:53,769
All right, so we're good human beings.

229
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:54,769
What the hell is going on?

230
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:55,769
Why is this helicopter, like, disembodied?

231
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,769
Oh, my god.

232
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,769
Wow.

233
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,769
Oh, he can't get in there.

234
00:08:58,769 --> 00:08:59,769
Oh, the pilot still is.

235
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:00,769
Can we get inside and do nothing with it?

236
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:01,769
Wait, the pilot's still in there?

237
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:02,769
Yeah.

238
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:03,769
Oh, the passenger.

239
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,769
Oh, come on.

240
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:05,769
Um, he's...

241
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:06,769
I don't think it's glitched out.

242
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:07,769
Hey, let me on.

243
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:08,769
Let me on.

244
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:11,289
Yes.

245
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,289
All right, let's go.

246
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,450
How do you do a wheeling?

247
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,649
Um, I don't know.

248
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:19,820
Just drive really fast into a car.

249
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Oh, yeah.

250
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Wow.

251
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Everybody's working for the weekend.

252
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Oh.

253
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
Oh.

254
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,049
Oh.

255
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:29,049
Oh.

256
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,049
Oh.

257
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,049
Oh.

258
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,049
Oh.

259
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,049
Oh.

260
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:34,990
Oh.

261
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,419
Oh.

262
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,419
Oh.

263
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,139
Oh.

264
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,139
Oh.

265
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,139
Oh.

266
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,139
Oh.

267
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,169
Oh.

268
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:58,700
Broke my back across like one of these telephone spots.

269
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I didn't even get like hurt.
