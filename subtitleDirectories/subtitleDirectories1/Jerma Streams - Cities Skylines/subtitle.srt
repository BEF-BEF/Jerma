1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,190
Hey. Yeah, I know. I know I'm late. I know I'm late. Don't make fun of me. Don't make fun of me.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,550
Don't make fun of me. Don't make fun of me. Don't make fun of me. Don't make don't make don't make

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:28,100
fun of me. Please. Okay. Hey, how are you? Good to see you again. Hope you're having a good afternoon.

4
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:39,899
Today, we're going to play City Skylines. I downloaded the Nvidia graphics card update.

5
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:47,340
I decided to pick the day to install the new Nvidia driver update to play City Skylines,

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,859
which I didn't fucking even need it. And my computer wouldn't post to Windows for about

7
00:00:51,859 --> 00:01:00,420
20 minutes. So I had to hard boot my computer. And that's why I'm late. That's why I'm not here

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:12,569
like 20 minutes ago. I come on. That's the reason. I don't know why I fucking looked at it too. And

9
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:15,290
I was sitting there going, oh, hey, this is, you know, this is an Nvidia graphics card update.

10
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,590
I'm like, all right. Yeah. What am I playing today? City Skylines game come out in like 2012.

11
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:28,790
I need that update right now. Yeah, sure. Get it. Anyways, I can hear myself talk again,

12
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:39,159
which is irritating. Let me get rid of this. They are going to play City Skylines. I've been

13
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,540
talking about this for about, I don't know, maybe a week or two on a whim. Somebody brought it up.

14
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,230
Hey, you should do City Skylines on Friday. Yeah. Okay. That's what we're doing. There are no

15
00:01:52,230 --> 00:02:02,840
mods. All I did was purchase every single fucking DLC in the game. I just, I freaked out. I kind of

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:14,840
panicked a little bit. As you can see, as you can see, I got campus radio, downtown radio. I

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,199
didn't know if I needed any of this stuff. I just, I bought the whole thing. I just was like, should

18
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:30,780
I get it all? Does this matter? So you can't even hear it. Hold on. There you go. You need camp.

19
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,439
All right. Well, here's the thing. I'm going to be very real with you guys. I, I don't know anything

20
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:47,780
about this game. I've never opened it. I've never pressed jump one time in City Super Mario Skylines.

21
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,780
I have to do the tutorial. This is going to, we're just going to relax and just chill.

22
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,199
And I'm going to play this fucking game. I don't know. You know what I'm saying? I just,

23
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:10,680
I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, I can't skip the tutorial. That was a terrible joke. I made a joke.

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:20,229
What? When? What? Didn't I just tell you what I was doing? What did I say? There is no tutorial.

25
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:38,280
Are you ready? Am I ready? Campus radio is an OST. What about, what about this? Rock City

26
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:52,060
Jazz City. How much was all this? Rock City Radio. Concerts? Did I buy like a concert ticket?

27
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:59,879
Was this like $40 for the music? Oh my God. Whatever. I'll listen to it. We're going to put

28
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:09,020
it on auto principle. All right. Here we go. New game. Choose a map. Choose a scenario. Is there

29
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:20,649
like a here's how to play the game, sir? Choose map. Green Peaks. Why am I not playing Animal

30
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:26,939
Crossing? Eh, I'll do that later. I'll do that later. This was more interesting to me right this

31
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,870
second. We'll do that like in a day, a couple of days. We'll do that like, I don't know, like Sunday

32
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,620
or something. I don't know. No, it's not good. No, it's not good. I don't like animals. I just,

33
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,240
I was like, yeah, I, whatever. I wanted to do this. I'm going to play it. All right. What should I do?

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,620
Choose scenario. This scenario is all about making the small industrial city of Peachtree.

35
00:04:48,420 --> 00:05:00,810
Dude, is it going to tell me how to play? I'm just going to do Marin Bay. Choose scenario. Yes,

36
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,170
just pick a map. I'm just going to do, I'm going to do, uh, this one. No, this one, the peninsula.

37
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:22,089
You want to set random disasters on. The setting is global. Yeah, sure. What does that mean?

38
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:30,649
Meteors? This is like, uh, like sim earth, right? So like a fucking, the sun can explode or something,

39
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:46,600
right? Is that real? What? What do you mean dinosaurs? How is dinosaurs a natural disaster?

40
00:05:46,839 --> 00:06:00,569
Your town can get attacked by fucking 17 million BC prehistoric animals. It's pretty. All right.

41
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,529
Welcome to city Scott. Hey, let's start by building some roads and zoning the areas next to them.

42
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,250
Buildings will spawn on the zoned areas and you will unlock new city services and buildings as

43
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,490
your city grows. Okay. We need to build some building. We need to build, start by building

44
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:27,079
some roads and zoning the areas next to them. Oh, how do I? Okay. W A S D moves around.

45
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,980
So here's a road. Oh, it's just like rural coast tycoon three. Okay. Click on the question mark

46
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:40,810
button. It'll probably be with you. Sure. All right. Let's put some roads. How do I put like

47
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:53,180
the park thing here? How much does it cost to come into my park road? All right. Here we go.

48
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,959
Roads need to be built to provide zones for buildings and city services. Larger roads allow

49
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,480
faster traveling, greater amounts of traffic and big roads with decoration produce less noise

50
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,579
pollution. I need decorations on the roads. That's probably cost more money. I'm not doing

51
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:18,819
that. You just page up and page down to build elevated roads or tunnels. Tunnels? Road over

52
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:26,540
water to build a bridge. You just draw it? No, no, no. I'm not, I'm not pausing the game to look at

53
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,949
a picture right now because I need to learn how to play city skylines. I, I know, I, I know you,

54
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:38,069
you may have made my mouth like three times bigger and like stretched my nose up into my eyes and

55
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:44,860
like gave my eyebrow bone like 5% more density. I know. I already know what the image is. So

56
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,930
can I just learn how to play city skylines? We're going to be here all day. I promise.

57
00:07:49,930 --> 00:08:03,139
No, you pause pause. I'm not pa, I don't, I'm not pausing the game to look at an image to change.

58
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:12,709
Wait. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're talking about in the game. Oh, I thought you guys are telling me

59
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:20,149
to whatever. It's not you. You're an egomaniac. Oh, all right. Pause the game. I'm in the middle

60
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:32,570
of the tutorial. Can I not, can I not just do the tutorial first? City skylines collection bundle.

61
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,980
What about, what about this? What are you talking about? Buy to save 9%. How much did I pay for this?

62
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:48,679
Wait, the price. I know, no, no, no, no. Hold on a second. This is important. I didn't buy the bundle.

63
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:59,059
I bought the DLC individually through like the DLC page. Did I do that? Yeah, I did. Let me see

64
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:05,860
if I actually just like lost out on like fucking $40 or something. Let me see. This is important.

65
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:19,590
This is actually important. Hold on. Where's my like, my purchase history activity. Yeah,

66
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,539
I bought them all individually, but I thought the bundle was like other games or something.

67
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:34,570
Oh no. How much did this cost? Hold on. Let me go to steam support and find out. I scammed myself.

68
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:48,409
Hold on. Let me see view purchase history. No, no, it's it. No, it's all right. It's okay.

69
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:56,220
It was still the same. How much? Wait, 179. It's so much fucking money. How much was it?

70
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:05,980
How much was the bundle? How much was the bundle? Did I save money? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a

71
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,419
second. I think I may have deleted one. Yeah. All right. I know what happened here. So I

72
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:20,620
individually bought all the DLCs, but I removed like one or two, I think, soundtracks and one like

73
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,309
content creator pack. I was like, I don't fucking want this. It has like really bad reviews,

74
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:35,370
but I deleted it. So I think I actually did get, I got scammed. Most important one. So I, you know,

75
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,289
I know I did get scammed. All right. All right. That's fine. That's fine. That's all right. I

76
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:46,889
don't, this is, this is fine. So pound for pound, I got scammed. You only needed the expansions.

77
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:54,570
I don't know. Dude, this is like train simulator. It's like the Sims. I don't know what the fuck I

78
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,250
needed. I just bought all of them because like, here's the scenario. If I didn't buy every single

79
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,009
pack and I got to a point in the game, like a few hours from now, like maybe it's like, let's say

80
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:10,019
10 hours from now, like over the next day or two. And I don't have the dinosaur invasion. You guys

81
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,580
are going to fucking be so annoyed. Wait, hold on. He doesn't have like the, he doesn't have like

82
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:21,990
tree. Wait, wait, wait. The stream doesn't have tree 18. I, no, I don't. Oh, how could you not get

83
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:35,179
tree 18 pack? I'm, I got it all. Where's the music? I want to play the music I purchased.

84
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,139
Let me learn how to play the game. All right. Enough. Let me learn how to, I need to learn to

85
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,500
play the game. We have, we're literally at the bottom end of the popsicle sticks for the double

86
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,659
popsicle, which I mean like that. I wish I had those. Do they even still make those

87
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:56,980
split popsicles? I fucking want one now. All right. How do I play? Make a road. You guys just fucking

88
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:03,509
threw me off. I'm not even past the second bubble of how to make a road. It's been 13 minutes.

89
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:13,379
I need everybody to relax. How to make a road. Where's my road bubble? Okay. Roads need to be

90
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,980
built to provide zones for, yeah, and city services. Larger roads allow faster travel,

91
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:25,610
so just have a bunch of huge roads. He's molding already. I'm not, no, I'm not. I'm just slightly

92
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:31,830
agitated. All right. Roads or decorations have less noise pollution. People like it.

93
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:38,309
Okay. Page up, page down is to go up and down over a river for a river. Change the road's type.

94
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:48,179
Try the upgrading tool. Use a road type to click on an existing road. Click on a one-way road with

95
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,259
secondary mouse button to change its direction. Use upgrade tool to fix destroyed road. All right.

96
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:59,049
Where's the upgrade tool? Road construction, intersections, medium roads. What's the upgrade

97
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:15,860
tool? Road toll tools. This is locked. I'll go snapping. This is upgrade tool. Okay. Upgrade

98
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:24,340
road. I want to make sure I know where it is. All right. So you can change the road's type. So

99
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:30,539
this, these are one-way roads. I guess this is coming into the city. Toll booths must be connected

100
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:35,659
to road in order to operate. All traffic driving through the toll must slow down at the booths and

101
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:40,740
pay a fee to pass the tolls. This is when they come into the park. Air price can be adjusted,

102
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,129
but okay. So I want, I want a toll booth right at the beginning of the town. So this is like how

103
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:51,139
you pay to get into the theme park. All right. Here we go. This is just a regular road, right?

104
00:13:51,139 --> 00:14:06,789
Two lane road. Pog. That's a fucking Pog right there. Okay. Nice. All right. So now I'm going

105
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:11,830
to do what like 95% of all of us on this website do is after I do 1% of progress, I'm going to

106
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,789
stop for a little bit and we're going to talk about something, uh, maybe the progress of the game

107
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,509
or potentially something completely unrelated. It'll take me about three to four hours to build

108
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:28,419
this road a mile up into the city. What did you guys have for dinner last night? I had a, I had

109
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:34,519
a fucking spaghetti. Wait, shouldn't this be, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want more than,

110
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:45,429
how do I make more than one lane upgrade tool? You cannot upgrade this type. Why the fuck not?

111
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:52,169
Oh me. Oh shit. Okay. Large roads. Right. That needs to, this is what a bottleneck.

112
00:14:52,169 --> 00:15:00,279
Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I need to make this bigger. Wait, what? Wait, why? How many lanes

113
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:10,700
is this? Is this two lanes? Six lanes. Okay. It's okay. It's all right. These are, I need a,

114
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:21,580
whatever, six lanes of road. Just, I didn't have a city go this way. I don't have enough money.

115
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:31,799
How much does this cost? Oh, it's an upgrade tool. Okay. Take the upgrade tool off. Straight road.

116
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:54,889
Okay. Here we go. How do I tilt it? Middle click. Oh, what? Middle click doesn't do anything.

117
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:04,470
I'll take the snapping off a huge fucking road. Uh, angle. Okay. Road length grid. So if I go like

118
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:12,340
this, how do I tilt it? I have to use this. Freeform road. Here we go. All right. Get off.

119
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,899
Make only road. Build 5G. I gotta figure out how to play. This is not a great tutorial by the way.

120
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:37,929
Okay. How do I get to like, how do I build a fucking road for the left of you? All right. Ah,

121
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,860
look at that. Okay. Cool. This is so fucking ugly. All right. So this is, how much does this cost?

122
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:54,779
Okay. All right. This is a highway. So we're going to have the highway go,

123
00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:08,940
we're gonna have like an exit off the highway. Wait, this is a highway. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for

124
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:14,220
telling me how to play. Oh, wait, maybe that, what's the, what's the tweet say? Hello, this is

125
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,259
Cherper. Keep an eye on what your citizens are talking about and what's happening around the

126
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:29,859
world. Fuck you. Well, thanks, Cherper. Um, how do I build fucking roads? Okay. Why are you telling

127
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:41,160
me how to build a toll booth? Oh, should I have 55? Okay. Wait, wait. I gotta go back to small.

128
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:50,579
Okay. Now we're going to, how do I make like an, how do I zone this shit? Zoning. I didn't, what

129
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,500
the fuck? How am I supposed to know what the fuck this was? Zones determine what kinds of buildings

130
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:02,460
will spawn to the areas next to the roads. Areas indicated by gray grid next to roads can be zoned

131
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:11,960
using zoning tools. Okay. Why is there horror movie music playing? There are four different

132
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,720
tools for zoning. Fill, marquee, and small and large. Zone an area by clicking the primary

133
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,839
mouse button on it. Hold down the mouse button to adjust the square marquee size or continue

134
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,779
paint with a brush. All right. Residential zones are for houses for citizens. Commercial zones

135
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:33,799
offer shopping and leisure. Industry and office zones provide jobs for the citizens and produce

136
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:43,079
goods for the commercial zones to sell. So commercial zones, industrial zones, this is jobs

137
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:51,529
and producing goods for local businesses. This is his own, which is just another way to say

138
00:18:51,529 --> 00:19:03,210
the zone, I guess in a cool way. Okay. So this is our city. I'm just learning. So let's make some

139
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,779
houses, I guess. Let's have, no, no, no, no. This is our highway. I'm fucking learning. This is just,

140
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:15,380
this is just a trial run. So I want this to turn. All right. So you come in, you pay the entrance fee

141
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:21,349
to the park. Right to the right is going to be the carousel. It's every fucking person that's

142
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:27,589
ever played this game has had the carousel right here. No one has ever played this game without a

143
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:32,069
fucking carousel being right fucking here every single time. It doesn't matter who it is. It could

144
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:40,329
be you, your parents, your father, your mother, your friend. It doesn't matter who it is. Hey,

145
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,089
I built like two fucking centimeters of road. Let's talk for a little bit. Welcome to Twitch.

146
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:59,210
Did the thing I made fun of. I'm just gonna happen. That's what I do. Whatever. I'm just

147
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:07,960
trying to see how the fuck this works. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it, how many lanes is

148
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,240
this? All right. Here's an intersection. Do you have to put stop lights if people are going to

149
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:28,980
drive into each other? Okay. So you go. Okay. Cool. So I'm, let me just put houses here. All right.

150
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:37,299
Let's zone it for housing. So you, this is like, you come down here and this is the first street.

151
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:45,400
This is first street. This is residential. Like, can I just drag across? I don't have to click

152
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:59,619
individually. Okay. So here's residential. Terrible city planning. Sorry. Sorry. You knew

153
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:02,900
what you were getting into when you told me to play city skylines. You knew what you were getting

154
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:13,299
into of just being completely upfront. So I made zoning for houses. So how do you make houses?

155
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:21,210
I sure wish the fucking Twitter ripoff would help me. Okay. What's this? Um, it's zoned for

156
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,890
houses. What's this? Oh, you can pick the mark. Okay. You can drag. Um, what is like the build

157
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:46,759
tool? Well, this is just an ad. The game is paused. What? So what? I need, wait, I need

158
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:51,319
tutorials for the, I have to unpause the game. They build themselves. What do you mean they build

159
00:21:51,319 --> 00:22:10,500
themselves? What? Wait, I don't have to go down. Wait, they building themselves. What? So this is

160
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:19,220
like a, this is like a, this is like bacteria. They just build. Oh, okay. All right. All right.

161
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,180
So now, um, we need commercial. This is one street. This street is going to go over here.

162
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:39,539
This is going to lead into, um, shopping mall. Okay. Hold on. You never, literally never played

163
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:45,960
a city building before. No, I haven't. Why would I have ever done that? We're going to have another

164
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:57,880
city over here connecting to here. Now what's snapping on? What does it say? Space one.

165
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,519
I told you idiots. He's going to get so lost. Space is already. Oh, it's because of,

166
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:19,910
I told you don't use free form, straight road, curved road, free form. All right. So I want

167
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:28,299
curved road and I want it to snap angle, road, length, grit. So all of it, right? So I can't,

168
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:39,670
you need water and power, but water, water available, human replicants. Excellent for

169
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,509
physical labor, Tyrone operation. Thanks for the fucking promoted tweet. I wish I could delete

170
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:53,480
those. All right. Wait, pause the game. Pause the game. Connect the water pumps and I love how it

171
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,339
just assumes I know what that is. Hey, connect the water pumps. You need like a fucking giant

172
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:03,220
arrow. Just like a huge red arrow, just circling this a hundred times for people like me.

173
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:11,539
Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes. Draw the water pipes under your city

174
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:24,539
to provide bill. Wait, really? So small buildings. So like this is under the ground. Okay. Cool.

175
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,859
Note that the water pumps and drains need electricity to work. Water tanks store excess

176
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:34,460
water and supply the city automatically. Picture your water pumps are located a safe distance away

177
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:46,390
from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water. Okay. Sorry. I'm just chewing

178
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:51,670
on ice. That means I have an iron deficiency. Fuck. During the winter, heating is required.

179
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:57,940
Upgraded water pipes carry heat to buildings. Make sure your water pumps are located a safe

180
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:07,210
distance away from any drain pipes. Do I have to connect every house or does it not matter?

181
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:16,309
Can I just go like this? Is this work? Is this working? Do I just have to go?

182
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:24,730
That circle means it's working, right? Okay. And then connect the water pumps and drains

183
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:36,680
with water pipes. Okay. So now I need a water pump, water pumping station. Does this work?

184
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,140
Oh, this makes it. Oh, these beds is front and first backyard.

185
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,160
I'm looking, I'm looking at Zillow right now. This house is, is 215,000. This one's 220,000.

186
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,200
Honey, this, look at this one. This one looks like a deal. Why is this one $41,000? This looks

187
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:13,740
like a great deal in the water source. Oh wait, it has to be, this is a million miles away.

188
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:22,970
This is so far away. This is so far away. I have to, what? Okay. So it has to be connected to the

189
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:35,289
water. All right. How many of these should I have? 120, 120,000 M3s a week. Water consumption,

190
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:43,190
1300 M3s a week. I got plenty. I only need just one. All right. Now water drain pipe.

191
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,019
The water drain pipe pumps out water waste. Remember to avoid pumping sewage upstream.

192
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:53,609
Know that the drain pipe always requires a water pumping station to work properly.

193
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,460
Road connection not required. So I need to pump this like this way. Which, which way is it going?

194
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,460
Which way is down river? This way is the up river, right? I don't want to pump it into the river.

195
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,259
Don't tell him. Wrong way. Arrows. Yeah. The arrows are pointing this way. So I need to pump it in.

196
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:20,150
Wait, you just dump, you just dump waste into fucking rivers and shit?

197
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:28,069
Now, so this is current. This is pumping down. This would be pumping upstream.

198
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,950
This is pumping. Can I tilt it? Can I turn it? Is there a way to like tilt buildings? Like turn

199
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:45,190
buildings? That's wrong. It just flows with the water. Yeah. So this is going downstream.

200
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:55,619
So just make sure there's no like houses or anything right here. You'll get green options

201
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:08,279
later. Oh, music. Put it at the edge of the map. So like down here. So just, all right. Just

202
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:13,910
whatever. It's at the end of the world. Evil fucking music. Does this need to be connected?

203
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:23,140
Connect the water pipes and drains. So now I have to connect this to all the houses.

204
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:41,460
Holy shit. This is complicated. Okay. I wish the tutorial would tell me just how to fucking

205
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:54,789
basically control a camera. All right. So now we go like this. Okay. Here we go. That's correct.

206
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,789
That's okay. So now the water is here. Water pumping station needs to be connected to here,

207
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:16,859
right? Is this correct? That's correct, right? Done. All right. You got water. Water pipe.

208
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:26,299
Heating. Oh, it needs heat pipes too. Not yet. Water pipe with heating pipe. Okay. Sounds good.

209
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:36,039
And it kind of works. So that's that. That's the, this is like the shit drain where like all the,

210
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,480
all the pee and stuff goes. That's where all the pee goes. And then this is the water pump,

211
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,980
which is connected here, which pumps water into the houses. I'm gonna connect. I have to connect

212
00:29:46,980 --> 00:30:06,619
these. What? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Doesn't this like the shit and stuff connected? It doesn't

213
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:13,640
matter. Oh, so wait, the water is coming in here and like the shit is coming in here. All right. So

214
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,220
doesn't matter. All right. Time for power. I'll figure this out. Don't worry. It's gonna be a long

215
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,579
one. Don't worry guys. This stream is going to be like, this stream will be at least four to eight

216
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:26,779
hours, four to six hours. You know, that's going to be a long one. It'll be at least three to six

217
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:39,180
hours. I'll figure it out. Now I need power. Oh wait, should I? Hooray. The water pumping station

218
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:45,500
has been constructed. Fresh water. Mayo or rocks. Mayo rocks. Okay. You're gonna really throw in

219
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:54,980
your like mayo agenda at the end of that tweet. Okay. How do I build power? Isn't this right here?

220
00:30:55,059 --> 00:31:04,650
Garbage and industry. Where's power? Oh, electricity. Okay. Power plants produce electricity

221
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:13,369
for all your m- pause. Power plants produce electricity for all your modern cities need.

222
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:19,190
Electricity will move from building to building over short distances, but to transfer electricity

223
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,150
over great distances, you'll need to build power lines. This is gonna be so fucked up.

224
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:30,099
When placing power lines, you can see the reach. So I get it. You build the infrastructure first

225
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,380
before you build any fucking roads. You do all this shit first and then you build the

226
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:45,640
two roads over it. You do, you go from bottom up. I get it. We'll do that next time. No shit.

227
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:52,460
I love how people are saying to me no shit when I've never played a city builder in my entire life.

228
00:31:52,460 --> 00:32:00,519
I don't, I'm not a fucking architect. I didn't know you had to, I thought you had to individually

229
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:07,529
put buildings down like fucking monopoly style one by one on each grid. This is a new experience

230
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:17,960
for me. So I would appreciate banning that person for life. When placing power lines,

231
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,660
you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings. So here's a power line. You can see

232
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,859
the reach of electricity around the buildings is light blue area. Connect these areas with power

233
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:33,509
lines to move electricity between them. Power plants produce ground and noise pollution. When

234
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:42,619
placing a power plant, the circular area around the houses you fa- fa- whatever. So I, okay,

235
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:49,480
on all the streets I've ever been on, power lines are like here. Like they go like this.

236
00:32:49,480 --> 00:33:04,089
Should I put them behind the houses? Okay. That's a street right there. Is that working?

237
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:22,869
And then I need to go to the power plant. Let's just look at the picture. Okay, how do you undo?

238
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:30,279
Is there an undo? Where's the undo? No, these are not just, okay, these are pow- I'm thinking about

239
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:36,099
in like it, when I, okay, listen, listen to me. This is important. When I lived in Massachusetts,

240
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,500
every road had fucking power lines and poles going across. It's not that kind of power line and poles.

241
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,700
Out here in Vegas, they're all underground. But you guys know what I'm talking about when you

242
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,759
drive- I didn't know. I thought, okay, I get it. There were power lines fucking everywhere in

243
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:55,480
Massachusetts, on every street. They lo- it looks like this. I'm just going on based on what I grew

244
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:02,309
up looking at. Those are telephone lines. I know. But like, I- I'm sorry. I don't- I'm not a fucking

245
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:08,360
ar- okay. I'm not an architect. And I never- I'm not a city builder. I'm a- I'm a- I'm a begging

246
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:18,619
e-clown. Did you get- I understand the difference. Okay, so let's uh, how do I remove this? Why the

247
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:34,699
fuck is this scary fucking music? How do I change the music? Bottom right, free camera, global

248
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:44,519
happiness. Wait, I can do wind. Don't tell him. No, tell me how to change the fucking music.

249
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:04,840
Oh, here it is. Okay. How do you change it? Classical. Rock City. All right, how about- what's

250
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:11,460
one of the ones I paid for? Campus Radio. Please note some of the radio channels have licensed

251
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:28,920
music and cannot be used when streaming. Let's turn it off! All that jazz. Hey, that's all right.

252
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:36,500
A little loud, but here, let's- no, no, I don't want you- this is a- I don't like when people see

253
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:42,519
your uh, my menus. I feel like you look- I feel like you look at me naked. I mean, this is- I

254
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:45,719
don't want you- this is like weird. I got- what's- what's- what are your settings at? I don't want

255
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:58,070
you to see this. Anyway, that's better. Increase the FOV. There is no FOV in this fucking game.

256
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:06,760
All right, sure. Here, I'll do it. Okay. Let's get V-Sync turned on. I don't think I'm worried

257
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,670
about frames in this one. It doesn't matter. I'm not playing like Counter-Strike with like a

258
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:23,849
fucking 240 Hertz monitor, guys. This is City Sky. All right. So, when placing a power plant,

259
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:30,659
so you just kind of connect to a power plant. So put a power plant like over here. Like right over

260
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:40,460
here. I get it. This is just a tutorial for me, guys. All right, just relax. Power plant. Coal? Coal

261
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:48,440
uses coal. Wait, there's a- there's gonna be a coal plant over here? Billy must be placed on a

262
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:57,369
roadside. What? All right, this is gonna be where the industry is. This is gonna be industry way.

263
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:18,340
Um, okay. He will learn. I will learn. You must learn. Learn what? Everything. Don't fucking give

264
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:24,099
me an opportunity to make a three-eyed raven quote, okay? I'll do it every time. I'll do it

265
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:37,670
every fucking single time. Do not let me do that again. All right, so now we build. Uh, just,

266
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:44,280
all right, here we go. On this side. That's good. Will this- oh, it has to be connected.

267
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:52,420
I have to be directly connected to a power line? Does that have to be directly connected? No.

268
00:37:52,420 --> 00:38:05,559
Just to be in the circle? Yes. Look at the drawing. Sick. Okay. Right here. I don't want it to be

269
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:18,679
too close to the residential area. Fuck. Well, come on. I thought it was the circle. Not this

270
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:27,179
one. All right, it's gonna be moved. How do I- how do I undo? Why is it no undo? I'm learning. I'm

271
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:35,099
learning. I'm learning. This is a learning stream. Bottom right bulldozer. Yoink. Okay. Coal power

272
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:43,260
plant. Bright air should do it. There we are. We're now producing power to every citizen on

273
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:49,000
earth. Okay. When placing a power plant, the circular area around tells you how far the

274
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,690
pollution spreads. Maybe if you've read the text. All right, sounds good. Let's get the fuck out of

275
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:15,800
this. Um, this is not working. Why is it- this is broken. What's wrong with this? Why is it broken?

276
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,849
It says- it's like- it's like a severed plug. What does that mean? A local power plant is online.

277
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:33,079
Maybe I'll get my TV working again. Hashtag reality shows 24 7. I love the smell of burning

278
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,860
fossil fuel in the morning. Dino power. Pro-fossil. All right, I'm starting to understand

279
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:52,539
what's going on here. So what the hell is this? Is this how, like, to leave the city? Um, wait, what?

280
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,929
Wait a minute. This is how to leave the city. So, but you can't-

281
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,820
you can't go this way. Traffic is kind of- nobody can even go down this road.

282
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:24,309
Malicious compliance. Well, I said to build four lanes. I'm gonna do it.

283
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:35,860
Redditor. Oh, stop. Whatever, I'll fix it later. We'll fix it in post. Okay, so, uh, how's everybody

284
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:42,840
doing? We need more stuff. Let's go to, uh, um, um, no, no, no, I don't want any more of this shit.

285
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:59,289
All right, I'll delete these. Can I delete this? How much space is this? What was the emergency?

286
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:03,769
What was the- was that the emergency warning? I'm not sure. What the fuck is it talking about?

287
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:15,460
All right, so this is fine, right? I don't- I love Hey Arnold, but I don't want to hear

288
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:29,719
Hey Arnold music right now. How about, um, this one? So, I need to build the more industry or

289
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:34,949
something. Wiz tutorial part two. Reach a population of four- all right, we need more buildings.

290
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:47,019
Zone. Uh, here, let's add some neighbors. Give me a road. No, no, I don't want a huge ass road.

291
00:41:47,019 --> 00:42:09,449
All right, this is gonna go like this. That's so ugly. I- uh, doesn't matter. Is it- how many lanes

292
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:23,340
is this? Wait, hold on, is this a one way? Hold on, is this two- wait, two- no, this is a two-lane

293
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:35,989
road. Okay, that's fine. Is it day-night cycle? Holy shit! All right, let's go, uh, more houses.

294
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:51,940
This is just one little road. There, look at that. Okay, now we need electricity to go-

295
00:42:53,219 --> 00:43:07,420
how many citizens? He's running out of- oh fuck, I only have two thousand dollars!

296
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:18,219
Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. What the fuck are you talking about? City budget for 2020?

297
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:30,579
Wait, people have to park on the street? The local budget meeting for, uh, Wink Dink City

298
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:38,309
for 2020. We're building a new city. We are allowing $41,000 to build 12 power plants,

299
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:46,869
500 houses. It's gonna be anthills is what we- excuse me. What do you mean there are no jobs?

300
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:51,750
Holy shit, they're crashing into each other. There's people! Hey, look, there's people!

301
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,079
They need jobs. All right, well, we'll give them jobs! How do I give somebody a job?

302
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:10,260
At the water and sewage plants? People will work here? I need to build- okay, everyone needs to

303
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,900
work at the water and sewage zone. I need- wait, I need to do zone commercial. Load- oh, okay.

304
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:37,480
I don't have any fucking money! Let's have it just be businesses, like, right here. All right,

305
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:47,079
this is gonna be commercial. Why are they saying no water? Do we have to have a day-night cycle in

306
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:54,219
this game? What's this? Disasters. Incoming. What? Hold on, why is it saying disasters?

307
00:44:54,780 --> 00:45:04,099
They don't have any w- what do you mean they have no water? Oh. Oh, you motherfucker. This

308
00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:24,199
needs electricity. Okay. But how the- what? Holy shit! This is the wrong- okay. This needed to

309
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:31,179
be on the other side of the whole world! Take a lo- all right, I'm starting over. I'm starting

310
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:45,300
over. New one. New game. What do you mean no? How do I take a loan out? Budget. You can manage

311
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,690
your city's taxes. Oh, you can charge taxes? Budget and loans here. Majority- pause the game.

312
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:56,440
The majority of your city's income comes from taxes. Tax income is based on the size and

313
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,090
level of the buildings in each of the zones. High taxation will make people unhappy

314
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:08,150
and might cause them to move away. A bigger budget for a service means that facilities

315
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,110
work more efficiently, but also becomes more expensive to maintain, right? City service

316
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,030
budgets can be adjusted separately for day and night time from the slides in the budget view.

317
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:22,630
You can take a loans from different banks. The amount and interest rates differ from bank to bank

318
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:27,110
and there's a limited number of loans that can be taken simultaneously. Okay, well, let's just-

319
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:39,380
let's take a huge loan out. Income. Uh, okay. It's all loan. Loans. How do I get a loan?

320
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:52,760
I don't have enough people to take a loan out. You need a bigger city for a loan.

321
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:18,739
New game. I want a different map. I want, um, what do I want? Garden Rivers? Eden Valley?

322
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:28,570
I want a balanced place. Turn off in- turn on infinite money. I'm not gonna do that.

323
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:41,929
Sand Vegas? No, I'm not ready for Sand Vegas. Where's Sand Vegas? I'm gonna do- I'm gonna do

324
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:56,309
one of the easy ones. Like, this one looks pretty easy. Eden Valley. Wait, this is the one I just did.

325
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:02,230
Do dust- a dust ball. I'm not doing- no, these are difficult. Wait, Marble Canyon. This looks

326
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:07,769
pretty cool. No, it's too advanced. Too advanced. Too advanced. Too advanced. Garden Rivers. I'm

327
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:20,900
doing it. I still have to learn how to play. I'm not- turn off the day night cycle on the options.

328
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:32,710
Good call. Boo boo. I need to learn. I can't just- you should have played the tutorial. I just did.

329
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:43,260
That's what I'm doing. I'm learning how to play. Hey, you should have done the tutorial. I'm doing

330
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:57,820
it right now. That's what I'm doing. All right, options. Gameplay. Day night cycle. Yeah, I changed

331
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:03,909
it to Fahrenheit. Whatever. People are gonna be really bad. Okay, turn off the day night cycle. I

332
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:13,099
just want it to be light. Okay, so road. I want a medium road. You're not even gonna let me build a

333
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:23,510
medium road. Oh, I actually did fail the tutorial. Okay. All right, so let's go with- this is fine.

334
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:30,090
Go straight up. Okay, I gotta- I gotta- no, no, no, no, no. I didn't- no, I gotta plan this out.

335
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:37,059
Oh, I can't even do zoning yet. So, here we go. I want up here. We're gonna go into the city here.

336
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:48,300
Then this is gonna, uh, curve out this way. This is gonna be fucking residential area. Pause the game.

337
00:49:48,300 --> 00:50:08,309
So, this is residential. Over here. Right there. No curves. No curves. Why? Invalid shape. Distance

338
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:26,900
too short. You don't need a huge fucking road. Okay, now from here, let's go- let's do a few

339
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:34,630
streets. Just two or three streets. Just like little ones. Just like that. This is just- just

340
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:48,380
little roads. Just little streets. Like that. Just little ones, not big ones. These are different

341
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:58,179
streets. What are you doing? I'm making- I'm doing a- I'm writing a big F for fuck you! For

342
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:06,650
con- con- controversially making fun of me! How does that sound? Oh, we had a raid right now?

343
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:15,349
Who? What? Uh, is that what the- uh, hi guys. Whoever you are. What do you mean? What do you mean

344
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:24,980
raid? I don't see a raid. Who? Where? Okay, that's enough. That's enough. That's enough.

345
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:29,780
So, this is the get in. All right, so you get in, and well, there's that street. Oh, look at all-

346
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,070
look at this nice place. Look at this cool place. This is to get out. This is like, oh bye, we're

347
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:47,300
leaving. See you later. All right, bye. I don't know. Do you not understand highways? I can't even

348
00:51:47,300 --> 00:52:02,090
build a fucking highway. Yes, you can. What- what? Why is everything grayed out? Six lane- six lane

349
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:20,489
one-way road is what I should have done. Keep looking at the tabs. Two- it's the tabs, not the

350
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:34,599
options. I can't build a highway, guys. Like, I physically can't build this. I already looked at

351
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:41,739
that. It's fine. Ignore chat. That's what I'm gonna do. All right, so this is uh, cool. Cool,

352
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:49,320
let's go up here. And then, from here, let's have this connect. I'm gonna curve it. I know you said

353
00:52:49,320 --> 00:53:01,190
don't curve your roads. Don't curve roads. But, I'm gonna do it. Looks like shit. Let's go- we're

354
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:05,369
gonna go out a little further. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is just at dead ends. All dead ends.

355
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:14,230
Fuck it. Only dead ends. We'll go one more over here. Okay, this is where the houses are gonna be.

356
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,949
There'll be like a fucking park or something right here. Relax.

357
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:27,739
It's not even. It's not supposed to be. There's gonna be a big park here. Okay, now let's go-

358
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,380
so this is like some, you know, houses people live here. And then we're gonna go this way for

359
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:42,699
some shopping centers. Sounds good to me. Shop- use shopping centers. So you turn- this intersection

360
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:55,719
right here will do. Like this. All right, and then we got some- there's a shopping unit over here.

361
00:53:55,719 --> 00:54:09,750
Key. Let's curve it down here. And there's gonna be a bunch of shopping. Shopping. Perfect. Okay.

362
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:21,860
Now, what the fuck do I- how do- how the fuck do people leave? From here we got residential,

363
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,099
residential, residential. There's your water pump. There's your fucking, uh,

364
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:30,900
is where the water comes from over here. Power is gonna be right here as well. We need industry.

365
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,730
We need like a place where all the fucking stuff happens. Okay, so from here, this is gonna be

366
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:43,179
industry road. Look, it's- see, it's like a big intersection. I know what the fuck I'm doing.

367
00:54:48,469 --> 00:54:57,860
Industry up here. Done. So this is where like power plants and the pump shit and they're gonna

368
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:05,590
be connected and then down here. Okay, I'm done for a little bit. I've got- no, I gotta make the

369
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:11,750
way out. This is how you get out of here. What the hell are you doing? Don't do a curved road.

370
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:32,469
No curved roads. Is that okay? Press E when building curved roads. That's all right, isn't it?

371
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:46,659
That's fine. That's fine. Holy shit, big bits. That's a lot of bits. That's too-

372
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:53,460
Freddy Dread, another 200 fucking dollars. 20,000 dollars in bits. That's technically correct what

373
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,699
I just said. 20,000 dollars in bits, which is converted into 200 dollars into, uh, into human

374
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:05,670
money. He just paid for the game. Thanks, yeah, thanks for buying all the game and the DLC and

375
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:12,739
all the music we're not listening to. Uh, what's- what's one that I purchased? Mars?

376
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:25,909
Concerts? Is this- Country Road, here we go. The ads?

377
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,190
Hold on, it's like GTA?

378
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,630
Okay, game's paused. Uh, Freddy, seriously though, hope you're staying safe, my boy.

379
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:44,949
I'm in day six of quarantine since I flew on a plane from California. I'm slowly losing my damn

380
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:52,440
mind thanks for streaming. Yeah, it's- it's happening pretty much everywhere now. Just don't-

381
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,760
just fucking don't go anywhere. Don't do anything you don't have to do. Stay the fuck in your damn

382
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:06,659
house. If you- if you're in a place that has, uh, currently on lockdown, stay in your house.

383
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,250
Don't go anywhere you don't have to go. Don't fucking go to- hey, no, I think it's a good time

384
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,489
for me to go, uh, shopping and go all over the place. Let me go to a fucking concert.

385
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:32,119
Don't do that. Stay the fuck in your house if you're under one of these lockdowns. And watch

386
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:39,980
City Skylines by Jerma985. Seriously, thanks for the 200 fucking dollars, dude. You give so much

387
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:50,860
money to this channel. It's unbelievable. Yeah, don't go into crowds. Like, just don't- like,

388
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:59,579
don't do it. There's no reason to do it. There's no reason to. Don't do it. It's not fucking- it's

389
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:04,860
not worth it. Because even if you don't- let's say you're on, uh, like a lockdown. Or let's say you-

390
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:10,380
that's the- you're in one of these areas that's seen a lot of cases, right? If you don't- even

391
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:15,989
if you don't get the coronavirus, you- you could give it to somebody else, you know? You- you get

392
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:24,650
it on your hands, you know? You don't get sick, but you could give it to somebody else. Okay, mom. I'm

393
00:58:24,650 --> 00:58:37,190
just being- I just want- listen to me. Play the game. Listen to me, kids. I will be your mother

394
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:48,170
right now and I will tell you these things. All right, anyways, let's go. Oh, wait, no, no, no,

395
00:58:48,170 --> 00:59:00,150
keep pause. Keep pause. This is in the news. I know. I know. I know. I know you all know, but we need

396
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:09,239
to make sure we keep talking about it so we can get rid of this shit. All right, here we go.

397
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,400
Residential. Residential. Residential. All this is residential. These are all side streets.

398
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:36,619
Not this. There we are. Okay. Actually, I don't think I want houses here. No, I don't. I probably

399
00:59:36,619 --> 00:59:44,019
could have done that way easier, but whatever. Actually, why- why not? That's fine. Uh, do I

400
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:49,000
want houses over here, though? Maybe there should be restaurants and shops and stuff on this side.

401
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:58,980
Okay. So, electricity. We need to have electricity from here. So, I'm just gonna go from- this- this-

402
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:04,619
is this wide enough? Is it- how can I see the wideness? Like, how much this- this- what the

403
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:12,550
circle looks like? Can I see it? Do I have to put it down first? Oh, I don't need to do this, do I?

404
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:17,139
Let the buildings get built first. Right, right, right, right. Okay, okay, good call. Good call.

405
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:29,099
Good call. But I need industry, too. Wait, don't blow all your money yet. Hold on. I need commercial.

406
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:39,260
Over here. Let's just do this area here for commercial. Right? That's smart, isn't it?

407
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:50,949
That just- that's enough. Industrial needs to be zoned over here. So, should I- should I make

408
01:00:50,949 --> 01:01:05,619
industry over here, or just do this, like, down here? Yeah, okay. Looks alright. All right, cool.

409
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:13,980
Now I got enough. Let's let this play out, and I'm gonna build some electricity. I provide jobs

410
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:19,460
for citizens and produce goods for local businesses. Industry uses a lot of water

411
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,340
and produces ground pollution to its surroundings, so don't put it near houses.

412
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:29,500
Safe distance away from residential, right? I had the right to do. Okay, let's go.

413
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:35,110
Pick up the houses. Let's get them built. We're gonna need power here really soon.

414
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:50,340
Okay, we got our first house built. First house that needs power. Wait till these are all built,

415
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:56,260
and then I'm gonna do the electricity. You just go maybe potentially one power plant, dumping unit,

416
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:10,010
power plant, and a dumping unit. There's no such- there's no such thing as down river,

417
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:17,559
it's all just a stale river, right? He's doing better than 80% of chat. Thank you.

418
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:27,159
I want that- Twitch, where's my gold medal I can give to people? Where's my gold medal?

419
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:31,320
It's not VIP. It's temporary, like, 20 minute gold medal you give to somebody.

420
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:40,099
Why? I want it. No, not Reddit gold. All right, it is- it is like Reddit gold,

421
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:45,059
but it doesn't cost any money. The streamer does it. All right, here we go.

422
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:51,900
All right, build. Hurry up. Hurry the fuck up. Hurry the fuck up. Hurry the fuck up.

423
01:02:51,900 --> 01:03:05,800
Why are these not getting built? Game sucks. All right, here we go. This- can one power these?

424
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:18,300
Build hard- I need to build. Can I- speed it up. Let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up. Why- why is

425
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:23,670
the other- why is it not being built down here? Is there a reason why they're not being built down

426
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:35,900
here? It's just gradual. Oh, okay. So, start correcting me if I'm incorrect. If I go like this,

427
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:43,659
I just need one- oh my god. I just need one for here, and then one- I don't need that many, right?

428
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:52,949
Uh, pause it. That's a hundred community subs. Thanks for the fucking insane, ridiculous amount

429
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:57,670
of money. That's a hundred subs. It was 200 bucks from FreddyDread, now it's a hundred community

430
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:09,559
subs from Zyxia. That's so much. Thank you. Just one connects to the blue, okay? So, like, if I go

431
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:19,780
like this, out to here, and let's say for the power plant there, that's correct, right? Yes. Okay, good.

432
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:26,019
Good. He's getting it. Oh, I'm getting it. This game's sick. I'm fucking so excited. I'm wicked

433
01:04:26,019 --> 01:04:34,760
happy. All right. So, let me build the power plant first. So, this is where industry is going to be.

434
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:48,550
This is the- all right. So, this is where it's going to be. Bang. We go right there, and would

435
01:04:48,550 --> 01:05:00,550
you look at that? Electric. Very, very cool. All right. This needs power, too. Oh, shit. Okay. Well,

436
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:09,510
we'll wait for a second. So, this is powering everything. Okay, now we need- and it was water.

437
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:23,909
Okay, water. Same deal. Water pump, right here, and then a water dumping unit. Water drain pipe. Oh,

438
01:05:23,909 --> 01:05:40,360
shit. This is- how do you- there's no stream. I guess, is it going- it's going this way?

439
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:52,019
Let me see. It's going that way. So, oh, I have to go- as long as I just do it right here,

440
01:05:52,019 --> 01:06:00,780
technically, right? Just need to swap them. All right. Swap these out.

441
01:06:02,539 --> 01:06:15,619
So, the pumping station needs to go here, like right here, and then the dump station goes here.

442
01:06:15,619 --> 01:06:27,619
So, it'll be dumping that way, or even like here. That's fine. Dumping station here. That's better.

443
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:32,019
Okay. So, then they're pumping clean water here, and they're dumping dirty water there.

444
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:55,719
Sounds easy. Water pipe. Here we go. So, this has to hit all this shit. All of them. It's not symmetrical.

445
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:10,119
It's not symmetrical. It's not symmetrical. I want- ban them. Ban them all. Ban them all. Okay,

446
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:19,380
cool. Water pipe this way. Ooh, this is fun. This is like an iPad game with all the money.

447
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:44,730
I like this game. All right. So, that's water. They'll connect them. Okay. So, we're all good,

448
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:49,269
right? Do these need to be connected to this? Everything have to be connected. Everything.

449
01:07:49,269 --> 01:08:02,679
Oh, the sewage. Right. All right. Sewage. So, sewage connects to here, and they just have to

450
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:10,599
be connected. So, as long as this is here. But does this have to go across everything as well?

451
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:18,279
So, this will take on the properties of this whole entire unit here, right? Like that. So,

452
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:23,739
this is now taking on the everything. All these units. So, should I go from here to here too?

453
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:37,449
Like this. This is taking on all these units. No. Don't have to do that. Okay. What you're saying

454
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:43,369
is I should be- I should be careful with using these units. Twice as much. I should be- I should

455
01:08:43,369 --> 01:09:03,590
be double careful. Be double careful. So, be like BB. Like a BB unit. Let's see. I'm glad everybody

456
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:08,390
fucking hates it. Makes me so fucking happy. All right. So, we need power to everything,

457
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:19,220
which I need more than that. Well, I'm getting it. So, well, they have to build first. Let's

458
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:28,060
go build. TV working again. Nice. I can watch my reality shows. These need power too. Wait, wait,

459
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:45,510
wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, shit. Okay. Hold on. This is fucking cool. All right. Let's go.

460
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:55,699
The real germa just came through. They're not getting water? What is what the water works?

461
01:09:55,699 --> 01:10:11,079
Showering with bottled water is expensive. Wait, what? It's pumping right now. Oh, is this not

462
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:42,970
pumping? It's not connected? Yes, it is. What? Wait, hold on. It needs- It does have power. Connect to

463
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:54,539
the- Pump to the side of the building. Wait, it wasn't connected? Oh, shit. I thought it was

464
01:10:54,539 --> 01:11:04,229
connected. How am I- Is this connected? Okay. We're good. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. I only have

465
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:11,529
$17,000. Oh, fuck. They need power here. Wait. All right. You need power too. Everybody needs power.

466
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:24,949
Everybody needs power. Take it. Why are these not powered? All right. Let's go. But there's no

467
01:11:24,949 --> 01:11:31,800
plumbing here. Uh-oh. There there is. All right. We're fine. Our first little town is working

468
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,319
completely as intended. This feels like I'm teaching my mother how to use her phone.

469
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,539
Well, that would be accurate if your mother has never used a telephone in her entire life.

470
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:52,170
If your mother woke up one day after using rock stones and newspapers to get all of her information

471
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:55,369
and you showed her a cell phone for the first time. Yes, it's going to take her a little while

472
01:11:55,369 --> 01:12:04,229
to figure it out. It's going to take her a minute. Yes. That's- That's probably pretty accurate.

473
01:12:07,939 --> 01:12:13,699
Cave mom. All right. What about- How do I start charging like absurd taxes?

474
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:20,220
All right. Wait, wait, wait. Why are people not using their garages?

475
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:36,340
Everyone's parking on the streets. They don't have garages. Yes, they do. But how many fucking

476
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:45,670
cars do you have? One, two, three, four. And that implies that there's at least two in here.

477
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:58,090
Everybody has so many cars. This person even has a clown car. All right. Cool. So we've got

478
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:05,029
$15,000 of things to look when people have people need jobs. All right. Looking good.

479
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:15,220
Tax them. They're too rich. All right. Let's look at the money market. Okay. 756 bucks.

480
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:24,699
How many people live here? 226. All right. Where's the tax button? All right. Power,

481
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:30,979
how much electricity should we be using? Can we drop the amount of electricity that's allowed?

482
01:13:31,539 --> 01:13:39,739
I'm at a net negative right now. What happened? Oh, wow. Strawberries are expensive. Oh, but still

483
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:48,170
so worth it. Strawberry season. Shit. Okay. So why- I need more commercial buildings.

484
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:56,520
Well, this is- What is this? Denny's? Why is nobody in here? Why is nobody going to the store?

485
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:09,050
More housing is wanted. Hey, look. I got plenty of housing being built. Why is nobody going-

486
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:21,670
Is there no power over here? Yeah, there is. This counts, right? Look at the three bars.

487
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:30,539
No demand for commercial zone. Low demand for residential. Low demand for industrial.

488
01:14:30,539 --> 01:14:36,779
Nobody wants anything. Okay. Let's do some more. Let's build some more on residential

489
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:43,829
road. Um, I can't- I can't just make a road go through somebody's house, can I?

490
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:50,760
What happens if I do this? Oh, it'll destroy that house. All right. That's not necessary.

491
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:59,609
We can go like this. A little bit more out here. Out here. And then we're going to connect them.

492
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:31,420
Not symmetrical. Fine. That's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Everybody stop. Here we go. Boom.

493
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:38,550
You still want houses now. Oh my God. I need money. I need money. How much money does this cost?

494
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:54,810
Millions. Tax, tax, tax. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow. No rain. Wishing for sunshine.

495
01:15:55,289 --> 01:16:03,590
Housing brings in money. That's true. That's true. Okay. So, uh, let's start by-

496
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:11,340
how's the industry looking over here? Are we digging? Are we constructing? Is it- now there's

497
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:17,210
a demand for houses. 400 people live here. More. All right. Is there a way I can delete the grid

498
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:21,130
and just look at my city without any, uh, like to immerse myself in what it looks like?

499
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:34,149
How do I do that? Click on the X. Oh, there we go. Ooh. This is- this is really ugly right here,

500
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:39,880
but it's fine. This is turning out to be kind of a little place, right? This is fine.

501
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:47,880
And then from here, we're going to go over this way. More residential. This would be like the hub

502
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,789
where the- how do I build like a fun park? I want like a- I want like a water park right here. Can

503
01:16:52,789 --> 01:17:05,270
you do that? I want to build like a water park. And then up here, maybe like a curve this way.

504
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:11,670
Up here. More residential. All right. We need like little residential road. Lizard,

505
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:16,229
little red li- lizard road. All right. I'm making money now. I'm plus $72.

506
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:25,220
My weekly income is $88. I'm doing well. What's this say? We're good. Yeah, we're in the green.

507
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:30,149
This is good. Oh, right. Sorry about that. I want to apologize if I sound a little

508
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:37,420
overexcited. I've got this really exciting jazz show. Let's just say it's hard to contain

509
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:46,489
my enthusiasm. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry about this. Little Hamlet. For each population of 480.

510
01:17:46,569 --> 01:17:51,850
Now I get taxes and now I get loans. New services. Garbage, health care, education, and campuses.

511
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:01,399
Kylo Ren wanted to say sorry too. All right. We can get a medical clinic. Elementary school.

512
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:09,020
Landfill. Cycling and community school. Oh, lock schools. I'm looking fucked up today. I'm sorry.

513
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:18,250
Okay. Garbage and industry. Health care. All right. Industry. Hey, waste management.

514
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:24,739
To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant. Wait, pause the

515
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:34,899
fucking game. Idiot. Relax. Waste management produces pollution so the facility should be

516
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:40,340
placed far away from residential areas. Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes

517
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:45,659
ground pollution over time. Make sure you have enough garbage facilities. Landfill sites and

518
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:50,220
incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash. Make sure they can get around the

519
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:57,579
city easily. Good connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast.

520
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:06,869
Okay, we need big roads. We're placing a building. Observe the roads to see how large of an area

521
01:19:06,869 --> 01:19:15,500
will serve efficiently. All right. This is a recycling center. Citizens can recycle more

522
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,819
different kinds of waste when the city has a recycling center, taking less garbage pile up.

523
01:19:20,779 --> 01:19:25,430
The center produces small amounts of raw materials from the waste. Yeah, let's do that.

524
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:36,579
Oh, this is loud. All right. So this is... Let's do a recycling center. Not here. Not... It's

525
01:19:36,579 --> 01:19:40,260
got to be like out. It's going to be like a garbage... All right. Up here on the hill will be like the

526
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:45,460
dump. It's too expensive. What do you mean? How much is this? It's $16,000. How much is this?

527
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:59,210
$4,000. Is this industry? Does industry not give a shit about how loud it is over here?

528
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:10,310
They do. They don't care. Not as much. I think I'm going to build another road back here and

529
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:18,170
have the garbage dump be over here. Yeah, that's the plan. Go over here. Like industry out here.

530
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:26,069
Let's go this way. This is where the fucking garbage is. Shit, I need a big ass road, don't I?

531
01:20:26,069 --> 01:20:37,850
Big road. All right, we need a big ass road. Six lane road. A big ass road up here so they can get

532
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:51,369
up here easily. Wait, I need only one way. Six lane, one way road. What is... Stop. Don't, don't,

533
01:20:51,369 --> 01:20:56,060
don't, don't, don't. Too big, too big, too big. How about one of these four lanes? Will this be

534
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:03,210
good? All right. Up here? No, no, stop, stop, stop. Why? Why one way? So they can all... Oh,

535
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:11,770
they can't ever get back in. One way trip to the dump. You can't... You stuff them all out in a

536
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:19,859
huge six lane road and they never can come back in. All right, that's good. This gives plenty of

537
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:26,500
room for huge dump trucks to come in and out of the fucking dump city. Oh, fuck. Stop going so fast.

538
01:21:27,859 --> 01:21:33,779
Health care. Keep your citizens healthy. Make sure they have enough health care facilities and

539
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:39,859
the buildings have good road connections. Things such as pollution, crime, this crime in this game

540
01:21:39,859 --> 01:21:44,979
and contaminated water will reduce the health of your citizens. Ambulances travel out to pick up

541
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:50,180
sick people and patients can also arrive using their own cars. Helicopters can reach destinations

542
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:56,100
without road access and are not affected by traffic jams. Your citizens age and eventually

543
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,180
will perish of old age no matter how good their health is. The living citizens wish to respect

544
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:05,539
their loved ones by having a cemetery in the city to bury them. There's a lot in this game.

545
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:15,779
Let's just get 50 dollars. Chris, thank you Chris for the 50 dollars. 5,000 fucking bits.

546
01:22:16,659 --> 01:22:22,420
Jerma, we all know that with your age you could be the dad of most of your viewers. So the only

547
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:27,779
reasonable thing for you during these times will be to distract us. Start streaming every single day.

548
01:22:28,579 --> 01:22:41,210
I mean, I could be, I could be your dad. It's possible. No, no, no, it's not. It's not. That implies

549
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:52,899
wow. No, I'm not. I, there's no chance I'm your dad, okay? I'm 90, I'm 100% positive I'm not your dad.

550
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:06,140
All right, I got it. I get it. People are sick. You gotta make, uh, health care facilities. So

551
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:13,579
let's make a dump right here. Dump activated. Recycling center on the other side and they can

552
01:23:13,579 --> 01:23:19,770
fucking, they can be like the Twix brothers and constantly be in competition. Now this is too much

553
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:29,100
money, isn't it? That's too much money. Do I have more than one? Landfill storage. I don't think I

554
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:39,560
need more than one right now. So that's connected. So that is doing, that's fine. Okay, now we need

555
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:46,279
medical facility. Medical clinic. So it should be, they'll be like a little hospital center.

556
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,279
No, it's gotta be like on the, it's gonna be like over here. They don't, this is not like

557
01:23:52,279 --> 01:24:03,770
noise or anything, right? Large building. So that's fine. It'll be like right here.

558
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:13,420
Is that too much? Is it loud? It doesn't say it's loud. Noise pollution zero. What are you talking

559
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:21,699
about? It's loud. Oh, it's fine right there. Look at how happy everybody is. Oh, the music is loud.

560
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:39,579
Turn it down. I don't want to listen to this. How about city radio? That's all right. Okay,

561
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:50,699
so we have our dump kind of play. Does this need power? Wait, wait. This just, this is a Spider-Man

562
01:24:50,699 --> 01:25:07,829
PS4 theme song? All right, this needs power. Do you like jazz? So how much power does, can one,

563
01:25:07,829 --> 01:25:13,829
okay, I guess I can look. So electricity consumption, 10 megawatts. Production, 40

564
01:25:13,829 --> 01:25:29,029
megawatts. So I'm fine for a while. This is already occupied by what? Oh my God, have I been

565
01:25:29,029 --> 01:25:37,859
delayed this whole time? No, thank God. I thought my voice was delayed by like a thousand milliseconds

566
01:25:37,859 --> 01:25:43,300
because we played the weed last time. All right, this is good. Healthcare for everyone. Citizens

567
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:49,670
flock to get treatment for various ailments. Blue shots. Okay, cool. How much can one hospital

568
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:57,989
do? Patients zero to 100. All right, so did the garbage trucks see? Look, they're coming in and

569
01:25:57,989 --> 01:26:03,829
out very, very effectively. How much can this do? Garbage trucks in use, two out of 15, zero percent

570
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:16,899
full. So when it's full, what do I do with it? This is too epic right now. Deep focus. That's

571
01:26:16,899 --> 01:26:23,420
better. All right, so now we got any school. Education. Children need elementary schools.

572
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:28,300
Pause it. Teenagers attend high school and young adults can get educated at a university if one is

573
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:33,340
available. Education is complete when a citizen ends their age phase while enlisted in a school.

574
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:39,779
Takes time. A working school system produces educated adults who can fill high-level jobs

575
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:47,939
in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level. Observe the roads to see how

576
01:26:47,939 --> 01:26:54,300
large of an area will serve it efficiently. Public libraries provide entertainment and a small chance

577
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,819
for us all citizens to become more educated. The chance to become more educated decreases with each

578
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:05,350
education level. All right, so we need a, we need an elementary school. This is a hospital. Elementary

579
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:15,850
school will go right next to the hospital. Okay, if I plan on having a bunch of more,

580
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:21,659
it's gonna have to be like back here. All right, the elementary school is gonna be like here.

581
01:27:21,659 --> 01:27:27,460
Maybe two elementary schools. It'll be right here. This is gonna be, how much money does it cost?

582
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:34,380
10,000. All right, you're gonna be idiots for a while. I need more money. Let's go.

583
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,840
Yeah, you guys are gonna be pretty stupid for a little while. You don't have any water. How the

584
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:49,909
fuck is it? Oh, fuck. Oh, I hate it. I can't do anything about it. It doesn't matter. This is my

585
01:27:49,909 --> 01:28:01,779
first time. Who cares? Whatever. It's my first time. Does this need water up here? Does this

586
01:28:01,779 --> 01:28:13,100
dump need water? I mean, that thing looks like shit anyways. All right, I'm 52 dollars, 52 human

587
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:23,100
people dollars. What is this? Population. Okay, now I can do taxes. Here we go. Taxes.

588
01:28:23,739 --> 01:28:36,680
Low density residential zone. Okay, tax on income. So, 724 dollars a week or a month.

589
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:46,069
Nine percent tax. We're gonna make, we're gonna make 12 percent. We're gonna do it 12 percent across

590
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:56,359
the board. 12 percent. All right, we're gonna lower the taxes on the citizens to seven percent. We're

591
01:28:56,359 --> 01:29:12,390
gonna raise taxes on commercial zones. We're gonna lower the taxes on the people. Why is everybody

592
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:26,489
saying Bernie? I'm talking about lowering taxes. You're doing his voice. Was I? No, I was not doing

593
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:34,840
his voice. I was not doing his voice. No, I wasn't. Was I a little bit low? We're gonna lower the tax.

594
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:44,359
I was a little. I was a little bit. I, it just comes out now. Who's leaving? Who the fuck are you?

595
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:52,199
What are you leaving? Oil truck. Get back. We need that. Wow, this looks like shit. I didn't even make

596
01:29:52,199 --> 01:30:01,689
this. This looks terrible. All right. Oh, let's make a tunnel. Let's make a, can I make a tunnel

597
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:09,689
over here? No, that's too much money. I need to start small. People are just leaving in droves.

598
01:30:09,689 --> 01:30:19,460
What? Exporting. Oh, hot dog. Exporting hot dogs. Hot dog exporting is our number one export in

599
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:27,060
fucking Wink Dinkville. We export hot dogs. Imagine, imagine that's the number one thing

600
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:34,170
your city is known for exporting. That's an embarrassing Wikipedia article. Oh, what's the

601
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:40,170
number one thing that, that Wink Dink city is known for? It's gotta be infrastructure or maybe

602
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:48,010
electricity or textile. You're the number one exporter of hot dog meat. Oh, okay. Cool, I guess.

603
01:30:48,569 --> 01:31:04,199
How do I get, what are those palm trees? Rename the city. Bottom left. Why is this place called

604
01:31:04,199 --> 01:31:25,930
Las Vegas? What? I didn't name it. I did not name it. No, I didn't. You guys, you guys have seen the

605
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:47,000
whole thing the whole time. It just, it just pulls your IP. IP. Los Vegas. City skyline says

606
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,039
track your low. What's with this money? What's it saying? Money? Percentage. What does that mean?

607
01:31:50,119 --> 01:32:01,369
Was a little bubble. Taxes are too high. Taxes are too, who said that? Oh, the quiet corner shop

608
01:32:01,369 --> 01:32:14,840
says taxes are too high. What do you sell here? Unicorn jewelry? Unicorn jewelry. All right. Hold

609
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:21,560
on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Taxes are a little too, taxes are a little too high. Oh,

610
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:30,460
it's 15%. That's too high. Well, I want a 12%. There, 12%. Happy? You can sell your unicorn

611
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:38,619
jewelry store. Shit. They're like the four people that come in a week. Sorry about your taxes there.

612
01:32:41,880 --> 01:33:00,470
Is that, that was toxic? What? What was it? Unicorn jewelry store. That's toxic. No, it's, what?

613
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,140
Wait, is this your truck? I will lower your taxes if this is your truck. Donut van. This is the

614
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:18,380
Simpsons. Where's the Simpson house? Where's Homer Simpson? All right. Stop paying, I gotta,

615
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:23,989
stop paying attention. Pay attention. What's going on over here? Bug spray van.

616
01:33:28,789 --> 01:33:35,289
They didn't know what to do. They got caught up there. All right. How are we looking?

617
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:47,340
What are you doing over here? This guy's out for like a Sunday drive. No, this is the only

618
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:55,699
way to leave. Right. Hold on a second. Does the, does the, does the bug spray guy and the donut

619
01:33:55,699 --> 01:34:02,659
guy work in the same building? I feel like that shouldn't be a thing. Why did the bug spray guy

620
01:34:02,659 --> 01:34:11,420
and the donut guy both work out of the same shack? Okay. Let's keep going. What's going on?

621
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:17,289
This is pollution. How do I clean this? I'm making some money. What are the needs? More houses. Good.

622
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:26,359
Let's do some more roads. We're doing big, big. Okay. I need a highway. Correct me if this is

623
01:34:26,359 --> 01:34:36,579
stupid. I can't even do a highway. I need 2,600 people. Okay. Two lane road, two lane one way road.

624
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:46,710
Road. Let's get some bigger roads. Let's go out here. Four lane road. No, this is a big hub right

625
01:34:46,710 --> 01:34:54,630
here, right? I need, uh, I don't, I'm not very good at city planning. It's like a, I'm going to go

626
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:58,869
this way. Oh, this is like, yeah, this is a commercial. So we're going to go from here.

627
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:08,250
This is like a big, let's get out of the way here. Out here. This is a little town. Here comes

628
01:35:08,250 --> 01:35:18,010
another town. That's why our camera upgrade road. Oh shit. I can't. Should I do this?

629
01:35:27,859 --> 01:35:31,210
I can upgrade them while they're money. It's all right. Hold on.

630
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:43,689
Oh, what are they doing? Oh, how do I undo, undo, undo, undo, undo? Is there an undo?

631
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:59,210
Fuck. Control Z. Doesn't work. It's okay. Whatever. I'm, this is fine. This is like the

632
01:35:59,210 --> 01:36:07,460
getting out of the city into the bigger city. This is just some little town. Okay. So I'm going to

633
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:12,649
go up here. The new one's being built. It's fine. All right. We need more houses now. Now, now, now,

634
01:36:12,649 --> 01:36:19,800
now, now. I need to, oh shit. I need more power and let me think this out first. Hold on. I need to

635
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:41,939
small road here. If I bring this down here, because the garbage trucks need better routes,

636
01:36:41,939 --> 01:36:47,079
right? Let me do a bigger road because the garbage trucks can't just have one fucking way. Do they?

637
01:36:47,079 --> 01:36:52,460
I mean, they, they need to have like a bigger way to go or lane road. I'm going to go.

638
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:59,479
No, that's fine. Okay. Whatever. I'm just going to go. All right. So this is going to be residential

639
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:21,289
out here. Elevation. What did I just do? This is going to be all residential zoning. Residential.

640
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:34,979
We need more. Page up. Page up. Okay. This is all right. And we need a little bit more commercial

641
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:52,739
down here. We'll need a place to work. Yeah. This is like the shopping city center. All right. This

642
01:37:52,739 --> 01:37:59,399
is fine. This. All right. That's a lot of stuff. There's still no elementary school. Oh, they're

643
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:07,960
just whatever. How much is an elementary school? Like a hundred bucks. Elementary school. Shit.

644
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:16,140
They're going to be idiots. Um, okay. How many do I need? Two. I'm going to need one out. I need

645
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:34,380
one here. Fuck. Damn it. This is going to be, all right. The people at the end of this road are going

646
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:45,260
to be exponentially stupider than the people at the front of the road. These people don't get to,

647
01:38:45,979 --> 01:38:51,430
if that's not, that's not, I don't have any money. Okay. I'm out of money. Go live.

648
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:57,939
Would you just tweet? Mayor supports education. Citizens approve of this.

649
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:08,279
No more homeschooling. Good. Okay. Cool. Let's go. Hand food, water, flashlight, first aid kit. I'm

650
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:16,199
prepared for anything. Bring it on nature. Uh, okay. There's tons of houses. Wait, any, uh,

651
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:24,460
any debt infrastructure here? This is a fucking stressful game. This is a stressful ass game.

652
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:38,489
I'm, I'm prepared. Wait, what did the person say? The person did not like the taxes.

653
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:48,579
Would I live in this city? Yeah. What's wrong with it? What's wrong with living right here?

654
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:53,979
Is there a problem with living right here? School right across the street.

655
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:57,850
Get in the car, drive right down the road. There's a fucking Denny's.

656
01:39:58,489 --> 01:40:03,930
There's a, there's a sky trust. There's a bank, diner, people hanging out. Let's go. Why would

657
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:10,840
I not live here? What are you talking about? This is perfect. I should rename this place. This is

658
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:23,750
perfect, though. I know you're looking for electricity. I gotta wait. Worthy village. Here

659
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:32,789
we go. I upgraded. New features, districts, policies, second loan, district specializations,

660
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:46,020
and services policies. New emergency. Oh, there's no police. This police, new industry specializations,

661
01:40:46,819 --> 01:40:58,329
self-sufficient building, organic and local produce, new power usage policies, water use,

662
01:40:58,329 --> 01:41:06,649
new buildings. Okay. I'm getting overwhelmed. Unique buildings. Have I unlocked any?

663
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:25,159
The statue of liberty. Okay. Let's put the statue of liberty here. How much is it?

664
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:31,640
$210,000. Should I get a loan to put the statue of liberty in the middle of my town?

665
01:41:32,279 --> 01:41:39,770
Look at how happy everybody will be with the statue of liberty.

666
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:46,710
No, that's, that's me throwing this into the trash. I'm not throwing this away.

667
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:55,029
Okay. I need power. Uh, do you have another power plant? 20. No, I don't need it yet. Can I go?

668
01:41:55,029 --> 01:42:00,619
Okay. If, can I go from here to here? Will it connect? As long as I go from here to here, right?

669
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:21,510
Okay. So this one plant is using a shitload of power. 21 MWs a second. All right. Cool. So that's,

670
01:42:22,899 --> 01:42:32,010
wait, I could have gone from, oh, right. I gotta come from here to here or here to here

671
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:41,000
or here to here. Whatever. Android and Ginoid robot models released.

672
01:42:46,569 --> 01:42:54,119
Sick. There's only 21, uh, mutatable watts, whatever it is. How much money do I got?

673
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:02,359
Now we make the taxes 98% for one day. I'm going to solve every, let's solve every world problem.

674
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:10,119
You ready? I'm going to make all taxes 95% for two days and then it goes back to normal.

675
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:23,720
There you go. There you go. I just fixed everything. I'll take in like $600 million

676
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:29,000
and then I can build like 300 schools up here and have like five more dumps,

677
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:36,180
two more electrical power plants, like 5 million more houses. Is that going to, will that work?

678
01:43:43,479 --> 01:43:51,500
And then I can build a statue. What a waste of fucking resources. Like this, this is,

679
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:55,829
this is why the world doesn't fucking work the way it should. You know what I'm saying?

680
01:43:55,829 --> 01:44:01,430
Cause like if, if like the governor of fucking Wink Dinkville got a check for fucking $800 million,

681
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:06,729
he probably would build the Statue of Liberty in his own fucking. Yeah. I decided that it was

682
01:44:06,729 --> 01:44:11,609
the right thing to do with the city budget this week was to build the Statue of fucking Liberty

683
01:44:11,609 --> 01:44:28,699
too. How does Mike, no, no, no, no. I got it back. I got it back. That's your Liberty to the sequel.

684
01:44:28,699 --> 01:44:34,140
And what I, I've never been to the Statue of Liberty before, but I just, there's a sign on it.

685
01:44:34,140 --> 01:44:41,699
I was, I'll just paraphrase it on mine. It's let's go get everybody over here and have a great day.

686
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:47,939
And bring on the fucking, bring on the Red Sox, whatever the fuck it's called.

687
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:57,289
That's having a good use of city money. Police officers small. Oh shit. I need,

688
01:44:57,289 --> 01:45:04,699
I need a police officer. I need one police officer. Okay. Fires can occur in your city to

689
01:45:04,699 --> 01:45:11,689
prevent, wait, the city can burn down. You didn't have a property. Oh, hold on. You didn't have a

690
01:45:11,689 --> 01:45:16,489
fire department. It gets fired. The closest fire department building sends out a fire truck.

691
01:45:17,449 --> 01:45:21,050
How long it takes to arrive depends on the size of the roads and how well connected areas in the

692
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:28,060
city are. So this is, oh fuck. Oh my God. How are these people going to have their houses are on

693
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:36,039
fire? Depending on the size, multiple, depending on the size, multiple fire engines can be dispatched

694
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:49,300
to put it out. Make a connection. So like from like here to here. Oh, that's a great fucking idea.

695
01:45:49,939 --> 01:45:58,550
Oh look, who cares about this thing? We can go like this. Is it going to delete their house?

696
01:46:00,579 --> 01:46:05,140
Yep. Oh no, you just got mad because the huge road came in. Is that what you were mad about?

697
01:46:05,140 --> 01:46:19,859
What are you so mad about? What? That person does not want a big road. Why? Because it's a

698
01:46:19,859 --> 01:46:31,020
busier street now. Oh, why? Well, you're on the main road. Okay. Well, that's, look at how much

699
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:38,710
better. Look at this new traffic pattern. Miller street. Wait, I can change the names? What does

700
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:59,100
priority road mean? Um, about, I don't know. Uh, how about, I don't know if I can just name roads

701
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:19,300
after presidents. Uh, Andrew Jackson way. Whatever. I don't know. James street. Uh, how about uh,

702
01:47:20,859 --> 01:47:29,479
George Washington Avenue or other, what other like public figure? No, no, no, no. It's going to be

703
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:35,000
like Lord of the Rings and shit. No, fuck that. Yeah. Nobody. We talked about this like a fucking

704
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:42,359
year ago. Why I had no road that roads are always like presidents. Um, like public figure is, uh,

705
01:47:42,359 --> 01:47:47,960
famous places, right? Why is it not like famous actors? We, we use the same street names. Why

706
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:56,060
the fuck wouldn't it be like Schmiegel Avenue or like Aragorn way or like the Khaleesi Boulevard

707
01:47:56,060 --> 01:48:02,069
or something? I don't understand why we've run out of names for us to, why do we have to name

708
01:48:02,069 --> 01:48:07,720
every fucking road after like George Washington, replace half of the George Washington avenues

709
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:18,489
with like, I don't know, fucking like Super Mario way, Garfield, Garfield court. I don't know.

710
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:31,510
All right. How do I get out of this? Zelda Boulevard. We've read, there's no more names.

711
01:48:32,069 --> 01:48:41,079
We've used them all. He's a Redditor. What are you talking about? What does that have to do

712
01:48:41,079 --> 01:48:50,779
with anything to do with Reddit? All right, let's go. Andrew Jackson way. Why isn't the local

713
01:48:50,779 --> 01:49:02,010
government doing anything to stop the fires? What? What building is on fire? Wait, what's this?

714
01:49:02,649 --> 01:49:11,479
Is this house currently being burgled? It's a fucking clown burglar. This, where's there a fire?

715
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:22,699
I need a fire device out putter unit. Wait, there's like a meteor response team. All right,

716
01:49:22,699 --> 01:49:26,220
just put it. I need a firehouse. I need one. Uh, like it doesn't matter. Just anywhere like right

717
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:36,199
here. I need one. I need one. I have to have one. I need a police station. Pause. Police patrol the

718
01:49:36,199 --> 01:49:40,920
city to keep crime under control. To maintain a low crime rate, make sure police service buildings

719
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:46,659
have a good connection. Okay, so how much is a police service building? Police cars are dispatched

720
01:49:46,659 --> 01:49:56,359
from police station to patrol the city. 12,000 bucks. Okay, I have enough. Um, I have to kick

721
01:49:56,359 --> 01:50:03,720
somebody out. Police station. Right here. Right here. This is right here. Look at that. Oh, right

722
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:14,439
there. Right on Andrew Jackson way. There everybody. No more crime. Long arm of the law reaches the

723
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:24,010
city. I feel safer already. Good. Now you're about to be in big fucking trouble. Okay, so,

724
01:50:25,239 --> 01:50:35,239
uh, I need more houses. How are taxes doing? Let's increase taxes. Let's increase residential taxes

725
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:50,979
to like eight, nine percent. We need homes. We need food. All right, how many do we have?

726
01:50:51,539 --> 01:50:59,180
I don't have enough money. I gotta chill for a little bit. Increase taxes.

727
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:14,149
World. Europe. Super Mario. What? We need children. Arrest him. Get in there. Why are they taking the

728
01:51:14,149 --> 01:51:19,319
house down? Upgrade underway. Wait, wait, they're upgrading their house? They're doing...

729
01:51:21,979 --> 01:51:29,189
Oh shit, they're doing upgrades to their houses. I don't know they could do that. What if they run

730
01:51:29,189 --> 01:51:35,130
out of land? Okay, we need a home. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes. Homes.

731
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:43,020
Um, fuck. This is commercial. This is commercial buildings. And then from here, uh, more residential

732
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:50,060
in here. Done. I'm a fucking, I'm a fucking goddamn genius. I'm the smartest person in this room.

733
01:51:50,060 --> 01:52:06,220
You want me to prove it? You're the only person in this room. Yeah, you get it. Okay, I can't do

734
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:13,420
this because the power lines are in the way. We got a raid. A raid from Limealicious. What's going on,

735
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:22,619
guys? What the fuck's up? Thanks for the raid. Welcome. We're doing, um, we're making a city in

736
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:28,390
City Skylines. It's a fun game. We make your own city. He's acting normal. Oh yeah, let me,

737
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:35,659
let me just prove you. There's nothing, I'm not going to just fucking instantly react strangely

738
01:52:35,659 --> 01:52:40,069
to something. Okay, here we go. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, guys. I hope you're having a good

739
01:52:40,069 --> 01:52:56,600
fucking day. I know, I'm acting weird. Right here. Curve it. Come on. I can't, what the fuck? I gotta

740
01:52:56,600 --> 01:53:03,340
replace this shit. I can, I can move this, right? I just like delete the shit and move it. They're

741
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:15,590
not going to have power for like one day. All right, what are we looking at from here?

742
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:27,739
Done. All right, sick. We need more high demand. Okay, let's go from here.

743
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:36,140
We're going to circle this back. I need a shitload of houses. So we're going to go from here,

744
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:49,659
a boink, and then we're going to, uh, no, this is, don't curve it. We're going to go from here

745
01:53:50,859 --> 01:54:13,510
to, uh, yeah, whatever. It's like a little side street. Yeah, this is fine. That's perfect. Okay.

746
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:38,840
Uh, all right. Now we just, all these are houses and then there's gotta be like a fucking school.

747
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:50,470
What's this? Wait, what? Somebody living in somebody else's backyard? Wait, somebody's living

748
01:54:50,470 --> 01:55:04,329
in somebody else's backyard? What the fuck? Whose house is this? Okay. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that

749
01:55:04,329 --> 01:55:18,420
I have to do this, but I'm sorry. This needs to happen. I need a connection to this part of the

750
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:31,909
town. What do you mean stop? I have to do this. You're destroying, you're destroying a family

751
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:40,340
building a golf course and I didn't even do it the right way. I didn't even, I look, it's crooked.

752
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,710
Okay, here we go.

753
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:08,340
And now we've succeeded in letting you drive the unduly dementia

754
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:19,220
test drive one. Okay, here we go. What scientists for decades claimed was beyond the realm of safe

755
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:19,859
driving.

756
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:40,659
I made a better idea, better idea. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to do the big one

757
01:56:40,659 --> 01:56:57,529
going off the way across like this. There we go. That's smarter. Okay. Cool. Good. I mean, I can't

758
01:56:57,529 --> 01:57:10,739
do this. I have no money. I have negative 88 bucks. Okay. Play, play, play, play, play, play.

759
01:57:14,069 --> 01:57:20,869
There we go. I got 200. All right. Connect this shit. All right. That looks okay. Now I'm going

760
01:57:20,869 --> 01:57:32,090
to build a ton of houses. This is all houses. Uh, delete this shit. It's unnecessary. Okay. There

761
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:41,750
we go. All houses, just, just as many as can possibly fit over here. Oh my God. That's not

762
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:47,579
a house. That's not a house. That's not a house. How do I undo that? How do I undo? How do I undo?

763
01:57:47,579 --> 01:57:56,140
How do I undo? Pause it. How do you undo? How do I change that? How do I stop that from happening?

764
01:57:56,140 --> 01:58:19,720
Right click. Okay. Right. Oh, thank God. Okay. Here we go. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.

765
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:30,100
Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. That shit off. I can't believe it's taken me like 10 years to

766
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:47,670
play this game. Imagine having a commercial building be in your side yard. All right. Make

767
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:54,069
sure we got everything. All the everything we need. We need some elect. We need power. We need all

768
01:58:54,069 --> 01:58:59,909
this junk. So this is going to go from here. Inefficient. I know probably, but what do you

769
01:58:59,909 --> 01:59:17,699
want me to do? This is hopefully we'll hit the people in the middle. Hopefully we'll hit the

770
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:28,119
people in the middle. Hit the people in the middle. I need a thousand dollars. Hurry up. Hurry up. I

771
01:59:28,119 --> 01:59:38,649
need a thousand dollars. Oh, I can speed up time. Hurry up. I need a thousand dollars. Going to get

772
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:48,840
shit. These people, this purpose, these people are going to have,

773
01:59:49,640 --> 02:00:00,939
ah, it sucks. Is it okay? Will that work? All right. That's sufficient. Now we need electricity.

774
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:15,079
Electricity from here to there we go. And there it is. Cool. And there we go. What's wrong over

775
02:00:15,079 --> 02:00:21,939
here? Tiny town. You're doing a tuber thing. Am I? Probably am. Oh, park. That's what I wanted.

776
02:00:21,939 --> 02:00:32,569
Parks. 1500 people. Parks and plazas, industry area, multi-unique buildings, concerts, landscaping,

777
02:00:33,529 --> 02:00:39,939
park area. I want to make a park. All right. This is, I'm going to need another power plant,

778
02:00:39,939 --> 02:00:48,859
aren't I? What's, what's their problem over here? Not enough workers. Oh, we need more workers. I

779
02:00:48,859 --> 02:00:59,239
need more people. All right. They're coming. More workers are coming. All right. I need another

780
02:00:59,239 --> 02:01:03,880
medical clinic. We need another one of these, don't we? This will be all right. Police. We got

781
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:13,670
a police station. I need another school. Elementary school. That's going to be, um, over here. Oh,

782
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:21,270
these people are real dumb. Okay. Uh, fuck. I don't, I don't know what to do. I don't know

783
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:29,319
what to put it. I need a high school. Everyone has a fourth grade education. Yeah, I know. I

784
02:01:29,319 --> 02:01:38,460
don't have enough money for a high school. Public library. Ooh, this will help. This is going. All

785
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:58,890
right. It's raining. That's all right. What about right here? We just have a public library

786
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:05,189
right in the middle of your neighborhood. Public library is going right in the middle of the

787
02:02:05,189 --> 02:02:14,680
neighborhood. Yeah, sorry. It's, that's happening. Okay. Public library. That'd be sick to live right

788
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:19,619
next to a library. That would be awesome. How would that not be cool to live next to a public

789
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:23,140
library? That'd be cool. You can just go read books and shit anytime you want. Walk out the door.

790
02:02:23,779 --> 02:02:34,069
All right. That's good. We now need more industry. Industry. Make a playground. All right. Park,

791
02:02:34,069 --> 02:02:38,229
park, park. I don't make a park. I want it right here. Wait, this is all commercials. Shit, isn't

792
02:02:38,229 --> 02:02:50,859
it? No, there's nothing here. All right. The park is going to be right here. Park. Decorative

793
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:59,020
elements raise citizens happiness, which is a key element in helping build buildings evolve. All

794
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:10,619
right. Small playground. Must be on a roadside. Oh, all right. Well, right here. Perfect. Look at

795
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:22,470
that. Perfect little entryway. Bingo. Playground. And a small park on a roadside. How about right on

796
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:34,699
Andrew Jackson Way? Yeah. Yeah. What about other parks? I don't have money for any of this.

797
02:03:36,739 --> 02:03:55,060
I love the new park. Can't read. All right. How about you make custom parks? I think that's a

798
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:59,880
little advanced for me right now. How's everybody doing? We need more industry. All right. We need

799
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:10,119
more industry up here. Industry. Right here. All right. That's, that's all right for now. I don't

800
02:04:10,119 --> 02:04:15,699
want to spend too much money. Wait, we'll get it. We're encroaching. How much? What's the, what's

801
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:19,619
the encroachment line? I don't want to get, I don't want to have it be too far over here.

802
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:32,229
Everyone okay? How's everybody doing? We're good. Global happiness is pretty good. Connect the

803
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:43,800
road so people aren't a thousand miles from the library. What? What are you talking about? How do

804
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:49,720
you need water? The one guy that needs water. You're right on the front of one fucking house

805
02:04:50,680 --> 02:05:01,960
that doesn't have any utilities. God damn it. Oh, it's so stupid, but I am gonna do it. Whatever.

806
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:14,869
Connect the roads so people don't have to drive that far to go to the library in their backyard.

807
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:32,420
People in the southern residential area. Oh, connect the top. Oh, you mean here.

808
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:40,840
Honey, you want to go to the park? Yeah, we could go right there or we could drive across the whole

809
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:49,159
city and end up there. Just fucking walk. Take the, go out your back door and just walk there. What's

810
02:05:49,159 --> 02:06:05,779
the problem? Well, this person's house is going to get destroyed. I don't like that. Okay. That's

811
02:06:05,779 --> 02:06:25,609
good. No. Oh, now you're going to get punished. I'm putting the waste management facility right

812
02:06:25,609 --> 02:06:34,500
next to your library. All right. That's better. This is looking fine. I bet you half you didn't

813
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:41,020
think I was even going to get this far. I'm certain that at least 20% of people in this chat right

814
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:47,819
now didn't think I was going to get past how to use the grid. Oh shit. What's going on? Oh,

815
02:06:47,819 --> 02:07:04,060
any water. They have electricity up here, right? Yeah. Did they? Did they? Okay. Let me just take

816
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:13,739
a sip of my fucking nice cold coffee. Can I do some more crime? I think I should produce, I should

817
02:07:13,739 --> 02:07:19,350
do some more crime. Especially like over here. I'm going to build up this way and then we're

818
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:27,800
going to do a little bit more crime. There's literally no crime up here. Okay. Um, it's all

819
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:32,220
residential. I'll get built. It's a library. People aren't going to be so stupid. Let's increase taxes

820
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:40,359
a little bit, please. Taxes are going to be, uh, 12% across the board and 15% for industry

821
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:49,029
temporarily for a little while. All right. Let's go up here. What do we look at? Let's look at the

822
02:07:49,029 --> 02:07:56,739
grid. Uh, what's the, we need more commercial. Let's do some commercial down here. Get some

823
02:07:56,739 --> 02:08:05,930
more commercial space. Uh, this is like the whole commercial zone in the middle. And yeah, right

824
02:08:05,930 --> 02:08:12,949
here. Let's go. What a great city. I would think of dreaming if I didn't know otherwise. See,

825
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:26,199
everyone's so happy. All right. That's enough. I don't want to go too far up here.

826
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:33,500
And then in the middle, I want the Statue of Liberty. There was a paid actor. That's okay.

827
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:43,909
All right. More. What do you think? More paid actor. How's Trash? Trash is doing okay, right?

828
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:49,510
It's only 8% full. Yeah. That's not enough. City's not big enough. All right. We're going to start

829
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:53,779
going up to the mountain area. I need a high school. I don't have enough money for a high school.

830
02:08:53,859 --> 02:09:12,619
We need to wait. It looks pretty efficient. Now. Now. Water? Is there no water going over here?

831
02:09:12,619 --> 02:09:16,470
Ah, shit. Oh, there's no fucking electricity over here either.

832
02:09:18,149 --> 02:09:29,960
It doesn't reach. It doesn't reach. If I go like, if I go from here to here, will it reach?

833
02:09:32,439 --> 02:09:40,279
Oh no, we're at capacity. Okay. I need another. All right. Pause it. We're at capacity. A little

834
02:09:40,279 --> 02:09:57,189
wind farm. Cheap and clean energy from the wind. I'm assuming this is high wind spots.

835
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:16,460
Dude, let's just make like five of them up here and then connect them. Does it matter how close

836
02:10:16,460 --> 02:10:31,930
these are? No. They can just, they can be right next to each other. Yes, it does. No. Put them

837
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:38,010
really close together. Is that what you do? Does it not matter? One guy. Okay. All right. I'm out of

838
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:51,590
money. And now I have to connect here. These are just both producing energy. So then go from here

839
02:10:51,590 --> 02:11:02,579
to here. Done. Right? That's it. Did it. Hooray for the mayor. More green energy.

840
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:18,060
Why is this one not spinning? Okay. How much? What are we producing here? This is working,

841
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:29,319
right? 56 MWs. They think the tax is too high. Tax is too high. Uneducated. We're all dumb.

842
02:11:31,909 --> 02:11:37,960
Zero available jobs. What are they even doing? Oh shit. Okay. Let's turn the taxes down and turn

843
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:45,880
the education up. Turn the education up. Turn the taxes down. We need lower taxes and smarter

844
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:57,539
people. Okay. Good. Taxes. 12%. All right. Is that making you happy? Thank you. Where's my high

845
02:11:57,539 --> 02:12:09,640
school? We need at least a high school education. High school. $24,000. Have you lost your wallet?

846
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:19,430
I found black leather wallets. End of PM. It sounds like a loan. I need a loan. I'll pay it back.

847
02:12:19,989 --> 02:12:24,920
I don't want to do anything insane. Budget. All right. We're gonna, let's take a look at

848
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:29,000
the here. Let's take the button. All right. Schools, universities, and campus areas where

849
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:34,020
a high budget can teach more students. Here we go. This is where we do, we do our city budget.

850
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:47,260
Okay. Electricity. Uh, that's fine. Water is fine. Garbage. We don't need that big of a garbage

851
02:12:47,260 --> 02:12:54,250
budget. 70% on the garbage. We don't need, we don't need that many people doing garbage.

852
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:59,340
Was this medical? Health care. Raise a budget of health care. Let's have more vehicles. I think

853
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:10,069
we're fine. Uh, firemen. It hasn't been a fire, it has not been a fire yet. Okay. Crime. It's

854
02:13:10,069 --> 02:13:16,869
been two robberies. There's only been a few robberies. This is a safe place. Okay. Education.

855
02:13:19,189 --> 02:13:25,270
We need more education. More education. A lot more. Okay.

856
02:13:26,229 --> 02:13:29,270
Uh, our parks and plazas. Keep them clean. Keep them organized.

857
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:38,789
Okay. Good budget.

858
02:13:42,310 --> 02:13:47,500
Where's that, uh, where's that, um, school?

859
02:13:50,279 --> 02:13:50,760
Where's the school?

860
02:13:54,439 --> 02:13:55,880
Elementary. Where's my elementary schools?

861
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:59,880
Come on. I got so much money going to the elementary schools. You tell me this that

862
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:13,899
night you can't get more students in here. Get a high school. I'm taking out a fucking loan.

863
02:14:13,899 --> 02:14:20,569
All right. I need a loan. I need money. Loans. Silver. Okay. You can only have three loans at

864
02:14:20,569 --> 02:14:28,579
once. Loans can be repaid instantly with no extra cost. Okay. This is $20,000 in 52 weeks. Pay it

865
02:14:28,579 --> 02:14:36,340
back. 5% interest. There's nothing. There's no money. Or this one is $60,000. 10% interest.

866
02:14:36,979 --> 02:14:55,369
Give it to me. All right. I want a high school. High school right here. That works. Time to make

867
02:14:55,369 --> 02:15:14,229
everybody smart. Wait. Put it like right here. Right here. Right, right, uh, right here. Space

868
02:15:14,229 --> 02:15:19,779
already occupied. It's okay. Right in the middle. Right there. Now we have an educated group of

869
02:15:19,779 --> 02:15:30,760
people. There we go. What's this thing? Public library. I already got one. Community school.

870
02:15:31,399 --> 02:15:34,439
Small safety school allows children to get education and grow into educated adults.

871
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:40,390
And just Institute of creative arts. I don't have the money for that right now.

872
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:44,630
All right. Now I need like an elementary school over here. Elementary school. Wait,

873
02:15:44,630 --> 02:15:47,909
we need more houses up here. Fuck. This is hard. City building is hard to do.

874
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:55,420
I need another elementary school up here. Okay. Two elementary schools and a high school.

875
02:15:55,979 --> 02:16:02,020
I'm going to, okay, build houses up here and then same thing with this way.

876
02:16:11,029 --> 02:16:19,510
Oh my God. It's more money just came in. Uh, just gave 10,000 bits, a hundred bucks.

877
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:29,130
Who's ready for some free shit? Well, I am apparently not enough educated workers. I'm

878
02:16:29,130 --> 02:16:35,379
going for it. I need some slight education. Thanks for the a hundred fucking dollars.

879
02:16:37,139 --> 02:16:42,899
Appreciate it. Thank you. You have an uneducated city. I know, but we're working on it.

880
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:54,229
More fucking money. Thank you guys. All right. Where's the high school? High school is right.

881
02:16:54,229 --> 02:17:02,219
Where's it? Right here. Operating normally. It's students. There are 392 students,

882
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:07,190
high school students in the city. Look at this number. Everyone's freaking out.

883
02:17:07,909 --> 02:17:16,819
Get my kid in there. God damn it. My son is 16 and he still doesn't know how to cow past 10.

884
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:23,750
He's still eating Cheerios at a high chair. Fill out the application. Get him in that school.

885
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:36,059
Okay. Fuck. I should have thought about this. Oh, it's on fire. Oh no, the tennis is on fire.

886
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:48,870
Put it out. We're good. Uneducated. Everybody's an uneducated worker.

887
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:59,049
Finally, we get some educated people in this one. They've been so desperate.

888
02:18:00,459 --> 02:18:08,010
It's like calling up the bank. It's all like third graders. Hi, I'd like to, I'd like to make a,

889
02:18:08,649 --> 02:18:15,450
yes, hi, I'm here. I'd like to make a withdrawal. Okay. Yeah, I would like to withdraw a hundred

890
02:18:15,450 --> 02:18:30,219
dollars from the bank. I guess. Can you do that for me? And then they turn the fucking screen

891
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:35,579
around and they point at it and then ask, can you, and as much as shit you don't know and you just

892
02:18:35,579 --> 02:18:41,190
desperately try to figure out, I use the fucking app at the bank. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for

893
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:59,299
coming in. I appreciate that. Thank you. Can I help? Can I help an expert in wine?

894
02:19:07,139 --> 02:19:13,930
The third graders can speak. They talk like this. Have you ever heard a third grader talk?

895
02:19:14,969 --> 02:19:20,969
They talk like, can I have some of that, please? I'll take, they don't all talk like that. What?

896
02:19:21,610 --> 02:19:32,170
They talk like this. I'll take one dust, please. I want one too. Yeah, they do. He's smoking crack.

897
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:37,420
Think of every second, think of like every eight-year-old. Yeah, I am one hatchet.

898
02:19:38,139 --> 02:19:42,090
Am I thinking two or am I thinking like 12? That's like a three-year-old. Oh,

899
02:19:42,090 --> 02:19:49,719
where I got it wrong. It's free school. It's like a 16 month old.

900
02:19:53,049 --> 02:20:01,129
All right. What do we need? We need some more out. Three equals third grade. You know the logic.

901
02:20:01,129 --> 02:20:10,360
All right. Here we go. Library users 12. How are we doing up here? What do we need? Nothing.

902
02:20:11,079 --> 02:20:19,129
I got $47,000. What should I build more? Okay. Roads. Can I build a highway? No,

903
02:20:19,129 --> 02:20:24,329
I can't build a fucking highway. Almost can. We're doing like a huge highway system over here.

904
02:20:24,329 --> 02:20:45,639
This game is so fucked up. Click on earth. Let me click on earth. Wait, people are doing,

905
02:20:45,639 --> 02:20:49,000
who's giving out game codes? Were you giving out game codes for what? What game is that?

906
02:20:52,069 --> 02:21:09,829
Areas. What the fuck? New tile. New tile. I'm not ready for this. New tile. What? Thanks for

907
02:21:09,829 --> 02:21:21,819
the amazing work you've done for the city. I have access now to this shit. Oh fuck. What's

908
02:21:21,819 --> 02:21:30,409
going on up here? Abandoned. The drugs store has been abandoned. I've got to get out of here, man.

909
02:21:30,409 --> 02:21:43,000
All you're sending me is fourth graders. They don't know how to handle prescriptions. They take naps

910
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:53,500
at work and I got to put them to bed. All right, I need more education. All right,

911
02:21:53,500 --> 02:22:02,540
let's just do all schools. Like just a fucking hundred schools. Oh fuck. What's wrong with our

912
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:10,379
garbage collection service? Trash is piling up and it's swarming with flies. What? Garbage is piling

913
02:22:10,379 --> 02:22:20,090
up. Okay, we did that. Uneducated trash to you is taking the bag of trash and opening the nearest

914
02:22:20,090 --> 02:22:26,409
window and throwing the trash bag out of the window. That's trash. Oh, okay.

915
02:22:33,979 --> 02:22:43,139
Okay, I need to slow down. Pause it. Trash. This one is currently landfill storage.

916
02:22:45,129 --> 02:22:54,090
What are they talking about? What's going on? I don't understand. Oh, it lowered the budget.

917
02:22:54,809 --> 02:23:01,079
All right, you can have some more money. All right, look at this. All right, we'll go back

918
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:10,620
to 75% capacity of the budget. Take down the parks. More education. 130%. This is a lot of money.

919
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:31,590
That's too much money. Ah, that's a lot of money. Keep it at 120. Okay, we need taxes. What's this?

920
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:42,340
High density residential zone. High density? Low density? Oh, I can do high density? What does

921
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:54,139
that mean? Low density residential zone. What is it? Wait, what is this? Paint the part of the city

922
02:23:54,139 --> 02:24:00,459
you want to become a district. New districts will be named automatically but can be renamed later.

923
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:07,459
Apply special policy by selecting and clicking the district. Remove districts by painting areas

924
02:24:07,459 --> 02:24:11,540
with the secondary mouse button. District specializations allow buildings to be replaced

925
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:16,739
by specialized industrial and commercial facilities. Specialized buildings can benefit

926
02:24:16,739 --> 02:24:36,329
from different natural resources or focus on tourism. Park area? I can make a, just paint in

927
02:24:36,329 --> 02:24:54,360
here a park? Will this just be like a park zone? This is stupid. Paint district. It's too small.

928
02:24:56,870 --> 02:25:05,639
Industry area. This is, okay, this is a little too much for my brain right now.

929
02:25:06,360 --> 02:25:15,239
Let me just focus on like building elementary schools for a minute. I'll come back to this in

930
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:25,739
like a year. Okay, um, I need houses. Residential, I think. Yeah, we need another power plant, I think.

931
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:37,430
Okay, um, a road. Let's go with, I don't have highways yet, which sucks, but this is an exit.

932
02:25:37,430 --> 02:25:47,139
It could be a new town over, let's do, um, all right. Fuck. Uh, I'm overwhelmed. Slow down.

933
02:25:47,700 --> 02:25:54,090
Relax. I'm overwhelmed. Okay, I'm getting over, here we are. Just taking a minute here.

934
02:25:56,280 --> 02:26:07,399
I want residential up here. Okay, I'm gonna build out residential down here, so it's nice and

935
02:26:07,399 --> 02:26:16,709
residential. Connect the highway over here. New city is gonna go out this way. Sounds good to me.

936
02:26:16,709 --> 02:26:49,459
Here we go. Looking to get removed, but what do you want to do? Shit. Build a tunnel, which is for

937
02:26:49,459 --> 02:27:22,579
fun. Hold on, so, wait. Page down, right? Page down. No, this is stupid. This is like, this is

938
02:27:22,579 --> 02:27:31,420
a secret base residential area. This is so much money to do, to build like a secret entrance for

939
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:45,209
a new residential area up here. Up in like the hills. Is it worth it? This is a secret

940
02:27:45,209 --> 02:27:57,459
residential area up here. What's going on with the points? I can't be total fuckface right now.

941
02:27:59,639 --> 02:28:03,639
God damn it. I did it. I shouldn't have done that, but I did it. All right, now we're gonna

942
02:28:03,639 --> 02:28:12,329
get out of here and have these opening for like the private zone. Okay, now pull it up. Page up.

943
02:28:12,889 --> 02:28:35,420
It's too steep. How do I bring it up? Page up? Why can I not get out of this? What are you guys

944
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:50,459
doing? Where's that road? How come I can't page up? I can't come out? Space is occupied. It's too

945
02:28:50,459 --> 02:29:07,450
steep. What the fuck are you talking about? Where's that road? How come I can't see it anymore?

946
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:27,670
Oh, okay. Page up. Here we go. Got it. This is so fucking stupid. What a waste of like

947
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:48,920
$40,000 to have like the weird private entrance. What the fuck? Okay. Cool. These people are not

948
02:29:48,920 --> 02:30:07,500
gonna be able to have any education. Wait, I can do this though. Space is already occupied.

949
02:30:16,889 --> 02:30:30,940
Channel points. What the hell are you guys doing? We're selling. We don't need no control.

950
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:40,459
Further we crave. It's just a purple chat room. Oh, you guys are wasting your channel points.

951
02:30:41,020 --> 02:30:45,979
For the next fucking channel point stream that's coming up, it's gonna be 10,000 channel points

952
02:30:45,979 --> 02:30:55,940
per burp. And whoa, sorry. You're not gonna be able to get me to burp. Oh, sorry about that.

953
02:30:55,940 --> 02:31:28,280
Ah, now it's cancelled. Why are they unhappy? What? I just did the same thing over here.

954
02:31:29,530 --> 02:31:43,290
I just mirrored the exact same layout over here. Except it's a tunnel. Why did I fucking do that?

955
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:56,379
What a waste of time. Secret Batman entrance. Alright, whatever. Who cares? It doesn't matter.

956
02:31:56,379 --> 02:32:02,729
It looks like shit. Do you think I care? It doesn't matter. It needs to be a slightly

957
02:32:02,729 --> 02:32:09,639
different layout. There we go. And there needs to be a road connecting this to here.

958
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:16,760
Done. Fuck. No, this sucks. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can fix it. I can fix it.

959
02:32:23,670 --> 02:32:28,870
This is the design that your fucking three-year-old nephew does on the back

960
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:39,610
of the fucking Chili's children's menu card. And this is like, what are you drawing over there?

961
02:32:39,610 --> 02:32:45,209
It's a rabbit. Oh, wow. That looks just like a fucking rabbit. That doesn't look at all like

962
02:32:45,209 --> 02:32:58,170
a rabbit. Yeah, but I see it kind of. You're trying. I need the big road. Two-way road. Here

963
02:32:58,170 --> 02:33:12,729
it is. Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade. This is the trash can get over here. Alright, now this breaks up

964
02:33:12,729 --> 02:33:21,350
into residential zones. Buy buy money. It doesn't matter. I'll get it all back. I'm gonna put taxes

965
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:28,500
at 100% for one day. This is a, this is just a stupid idea. All right. I like plumbing.

966
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:50,090
How does it know? Okay. Plumbing. Here we go. From here. Plumbing. Good. From here to here.

967
02:33:51,670 --> 02:34:05,290
Up here. Is this correct? Oh, I think I'm doing this wrong. It's not symmetrical.

968
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:10,809
It's not symmetrical. No, no, no. Fix, fix your discord server. What the fuck? I don't know.

969
02:34:11,770 --> 02:34:22,629
What are you talking, I don't even know what that means. It keeps crashing. What's the, I didn't do,

970
02:34:22,629 --> 02:34:28,649
I'm, it's not like I didn't pay the discord internet bill. It's just discord's doing that.

971
02:34:28,649 --> 02:34:35,049
Discord's, what do you, I'm holding two cords that aren't plugged in together and they can't

972
02:34:35,049 --> 02:34:52,040
be plugged in. What do you want me to do? What a waste to get this.

973
02:34:56,280 --> 02:35:01,079
How much, okay. Water's going fine so far. I'm gonna have to need a new pump or something.

974
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:07,799
Turn this off. Wait, no, no, no, that's the one I can't play, right? That's the only one I can't

975
02:35:07,799 --> 02:35:17,690
click on. How about um, downtown radio. Sewer, sewage production, sewage drainage. All right,

976
02:35:17,690 --> 02:35:28,170
we're doing fine. Water reserve and tanks. None. I don't have any water tanks. Okay, so wait,

977
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:37,670
what year is it? 2021, okay. Now, any electricity. Uh, this is a problem. We're gonna fix this.

978
02:35:44,020 --> 02:35:49,989
Now, let's let this play out so they can build up. Remember, this is all residential and a couple

979
02:35:49,989 --> 02:36:09,620
of schools. I don't have any money. They're all gonna be idiots again. I have to increase the

980
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:41,510
fuck out of taxes. 20%. Imagine living here and paying 20% property taxes every month.

981
02:36:43,850 --> 02:36:54,899
Vod mute. That's not, I didn't get the warning for this. Start building. No educated people.

982
02:36:56,950 --> 02:37:00,629
I didn't know that was gonna be that important. I didn't know. I thought it was just build town.

983
02:37:01,899 --> 02:37:09,180
I didn't know you had to make people smart and shit. Businesses are being abandoned because no one

984
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:26,659
is... Boomtown! Ooh, okay, I can do ferry, taxi, post service, a bus. All right, I need to make

985
02:37:26,659 --> 02:37:48,010
money. How am I gonna make any money? Uh oh. Oh, one guy over here is not gonna have internet.

986
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:51,209
Fuck, I gotta build all the whole internet infrastructure to get over to this guy.

987
02:37:51,930 --> 02:38:05,700
Okay, we're good. They don't like, I don't want these taxes. Holy shit, we're making a ton of

988
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:12,120
money. Just bear with me, everybody. Bear with me. We're just gonna have a bunch of taxes for

989
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:28,680
one or two more days and then we'll go back to normal, I promise. Okay, okay. See, now I'm

990
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:45,049
gonna lower your taxes to 11%. See, that's all we had to do. Not enough educated workers.

991
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:50,409
One job available. How many people are in the high school? Wait, I need like a college or something.

992
02:38:51,049 --> 02:38:59,420
What does this thing mean? Not enough goods to sell. What? What do you mean not enough goods?

993
02:38:59,420 --> 02:39:07,690
Any more industry? How much industry am I making? Everybody is an idiot. They're all gonna, they're

994
02:39:07,690 --> 02:39:15,030
gonna start eating each other. There's nobody, and now they're driving. How are you driving cars?

995
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:25,780
They're all so stupid. That just, you just ran over four people. Consume, there's not enough boxes

996
02:39:25,780 --> 02:39:36,780
from the box factory. What? Okay, hold on. I got money now. Electricity. Let's go here.

997
02:39:37,579 --> 02:39:54,309
What the fuck? Here to here. Fuck. Got it. Good. Right? 55. Oh shit. I need more of these.

998
02:39:55,030 --> 02:40:12,020
I need another wind. More wind. Good. Another one. Green energy. That's it. That's it. One more.

999
02:40:13,459 --> 02:40:30,059
Last one. Okay, good. You must construct additional pylons. Not enough goods to sell, but

1000
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:35,860
from where? Where do you really pull goods from? Our vacation was extended. Whatever.

1001
02:40:36,659 --> 02:40:45,829
Do I not have enough industry? Oh, okay. So we need medium demand for industry. All right.

1002
02:40:45,829 --> 02:40:55,959
Industry is going up this way. Let's go. Excuse me. Move. Excuse me. Move. Oh, two lane row with tram

1003
02:40:55,959 --> 02:41:04,260
tracks. I don't care. Okay, here we go. You know, upgrade. I don't want to upgrade. I want to

1004
02:41:04,260 --> 02:41:42,469
place it. Industry. So get it way the fuck away from everybody. Good. Now we'll have a bunch of

1005
02:41:42,469 --> 02:41:53,959
goods. I'm going to need more power plants and shit. Okay. We'll let that build out. We'll just

1006
02:41:53,959 --> 02:42:05,370
keep going. Let's just look. We need more industry. It's coming. I promise. Do I know what a neighborhood

1007
02:42:05,370 --> 02:42:17,079
looks like in real life? Yes. I just, I don't zoom out on Google earth and look at every neighborhood.

1008
02:42:17,079 --> 02:42:19,959
Every neighborhood. You know what? Yeah. Every neighborhood looks like this to me.

1009
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:35,719
I don't look at my, I don't walk out my door and see this. I told you I'm not a fucking city planner.

1010
02:42:35,719 --> 02:42:38,840
I already told you that. I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I don't know what like

1011
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:45,020
sufficiency and efficiency is. I'm just going with, rolling with punches and making houses and

1012
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:58,469
making secret centers. Nobody even lives over here. I'm not anymore commercial I think soon.

1013
02:42:59,030 --> 02:43:13,979
All right. I built this shit out. We need water. Oh, you dope. I thought I could do it. I thought

1014
02:43:13,979 --> 02:43:26,040
I could make a, like a V. It's all right. I'm not a fucking city planner. Fuck it. How about electric?

1015
02:43:28,200 --> 02:43:34,020
This. All right. Pause it. This needs to change. This is terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.

1016
02:43:34,020 --> 02:43:55,610
Terrible. Terrible. There we go. That's good. Connected. Good and connected. Good and connected.

1017
02:43:55,610 --> 02:44:08,120
Good and connected. Looks good. Life church is going there. Plumbing is going here. Keep it going.

1018
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:16,309
Add some city policies. What the fuck is a policy? Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm trying to pause the game.

1019
02:44:18,709 --> 02:44:25,899
Where's that tool tip? Policies can be used to add some flavor. Adjust where certain citizen types

1020
02:44:25,899 --> 02:44:32,459
live. What they can do. What sort of industry is allowed. Set policies. It can be set citywide or

1021
02:44:32,459 --> 02:44:41,379
limited to districts created with the district tool. Okay. So power usage. Energy conservation

1022
02:44:41,379 --> 02:44:46,889
is important. The best way to do that is by installing energy meters in buildings. Moderately

1023
02:44:46,889 --> 02:44:59,700
reduced electricity consumption. I don't need that right now. Pet ban. Smoking ban? Make this

1024
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:11,620
a smoke free city? The whole city is smoke free. All right. That sounds like not a bad idea. All

1025
02:45:11,620 --> 02:45:20,489
right. The whole city is smoke free. You cannot smoke cigarettes in this whole city. Prefer ferries.

1026
02:45:20,489 --> 02:45:30,899
High ticket prices. Park made. Free Wi-Fi. Free wireless access points for citizens and tourists

1027
02:45:30,899 --> 02:45:34,870
allow easy use of email and other internet services instead of traditional mail. This

1028
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:41,739
reduces the amount of mail. Let's go. Yeah. Free Wi-Fi. I don't need the whole city. It's all free

1029
02:45:41,739 --> 02:45:56,459
Wi-Fi. Okay. And smoke detector. Recreational marijuana. Allowing recreational use of controlled

1030
02:45:56,459 --> 02:46:04,729
substances attracts more tourists but also requires more police presence. Increase police budget by 15

1031
02:46:04,729 --> 02:46:10,170
percent. Reduces crime rate. Moderately increases tourism. No. We're going to have free Wi-Fi and

1032
02:46:10,170 --> 02:46:21,059
no smoking. Sounds good. All right. Am I making an entire city or am I doing the policy that's

1033
02:46:21,059 --> 02:46:34,940
inside of a McDonald's? This is a city-wide thing. I don't fucking know what the hell I'm doing at

1034
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:41,100
this point. All right. Let's go. I'm not legalizing weed. Not yet. Not yet. I can't have no, I can't

1035
02:46:41,100 --> 02:46:49,219
ban smoking and then make weed legal. No smoking allowed. And well, you can smoke but only no

1036
02:46:49,219 --> 02:46:54,790
cigarettes. But you smoke weed. You can? Who are you to say what I can't? What about how? Who said

1037
02:46:54,790 --> 02:47:00,149
that? Who are you to say what I can do? What's next? Ban sandals with socks? Not cool. I want

1038
02:47:00,149 --> 02:47:28,520
freedom. How's this look? Industry coming up. Industry coming up. You don't like this trash?

1039
02:47:28,520 --> 02:47:36,969
Garbage is piled up. 16 out of 16. Uneducated people. Time to do education. High school.

1040
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:47,540
Get it over here. Right here. It'll get everybody in this new area. Right on the edge here. Right

1041
02:47:47,540 --> 02:47:57,659
there. Because I'm going up. That hits everybody, right? Right here? Right there. Go. For the love

1042
02:47:57,659 --> 02:48:07,530
of God. And it's going to hit every one of these educational areas around here. Good. Good, good,

1043
02:48:07,530 --> 02:48:16,170
good, good. Okay. How we doing? We need, how's the crime rate? Recreational use or we riot? No,

1044
02:48:16,170 --> 02:48:32,170
not yet. I need to, I, not yet. Raise the taxes again. Let's go. Why is this shit taking so long

1045
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:43,959
to build? Riot, riot, riot. You can keep rioting. That's fine. Okay. Looking good. 9,000. What do I

1046
02:48:43,959 --> 02:48:52,120
need now? I need to start to expand. Is this high school full? High school students in the city.

1047
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:59,739
Okay. What about over here? 850-1880. All right. Keep the education going. Do I even have an

1048
02:48:59,739 --> 02:49:05,860
elementary, there's no elementary school. Education. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Children need

1049
02:49:06,100 --> 02:49:09,420
education. Okay. Elementary school. There's not, there's not even one over here.

1050
02:49:26,680 --> 02:49:32,520
Educate. Educate. Educate. Educate. Educate. Educate. Educate. Educate.

1051
02:49:32,520 --> 02:49:36,520
Okay. No more taxes. No more taxes. They're too high.

1052
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:04,149
Put more stupid people stores. I don't know. There's not enough educated workers. Not enough

1053
02:50:04,149 --> 02:50:11,219
goods. I need to just have, just build dumb people stores. I don't know.

1054
02:50:15,459 --> 02:50:22,629
Stuff like anybody can do. I need to put something in here too. Can I like just put

1055
02:50:22,629 --> 02:50:30,040
anything in here? Terrain. Modify the terrain. Oh no, no, no. I'm not fucking with this.

1056
02:50:31,719 --> 02:50:40,840
I'm not fucking with that. No way. What's this? Basketball court. Oh, sick. This would be, this

1057
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:51,850
would be perfect. What does the green over here mean? Oh, that just, it hits everybody in that

1058
02:50:51,850 --> 02:50:57,579
area. Okay. But like right here, right in the middle. I don't want to bulldoze any house though.

1059
02:50:57,579 --> 02:51:07,049
Okay. Right here. There we go. Nice. Everyone's happy about that shit. Small playground. Small

1060
02:51:07,049 --> 02:51:21,129
park. Playground. Put a playground over here. Hit this area. Right there. There we go. See? Good.

1061
02:51:21,690 --> 02:51:31,110
Feeling full of energy after a jog in the new park. Right. Fuck the mayor. We want to smoke weed on

1062
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:39,819
the basketball court. That's too bad. That's pretty cool though. Look at that. Do I collect money from

1063
02:51:39,819 --> 02:51:53,370
this? Wait, hold on. Ship? I don't have any ship. Tours. Just take a budget for the road maintenance.

1064
02:51:59,940 --> 02:52:09,610
Okay. Now what do I need? Got houses going up. How come they haven't built anything? Oh, I need a

1065
02:52:09,610 --> 02:52:16,950
plumbing and power over here. Is that why this isn't up? All right. We're going to come down here

1066
02:52:17,829 --> 02:52:21,270
and this is going to be more commercial. More commercial down this way.

1067
02:52:24,790 --> 02:52:32,100
Whoa. What's this? Bus? Four lane road with bus lanes. That's kind of cool. So you can take the

1068
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:44,819
bus. All right. You can take the bus from here all the way down to here. There's a bus. Bus, a taxi.

1069
02:52:44,819 --> 02:52:50,649
Wait, wait, wait. Yeah. Bus. So the bus you can get. You can get on the bus in the middle of the

1070
02:52:50,649 --> 02:52:59,850
city. So let's say that you could get on the bus here. This is the good place for a bus stop.

1071
02:52:59,850 --> 02:53:11,190
It's going to destroy two businesses. You can't just connect it. You can't just make a new

1072
02:53:11,190 --> 02:53:18,680
exit for the bus. All right. We're going to have to delete that for a minute. How are people still

1073
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:28,260
so stupid? I have plenty of high schools now. What's going on over here? Not enough workers.

1074
02:53:33,590 --> 02:53:49,540
What? Build churches? I don't have enough money for that. Health care. Build a university.

1075
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:57,079
How much is a university? Public library. Institute of creative arts. Thirty thousand.

1076
02:53:57,639 --> 02:54:05,270
Come on. I can't. I can't build this. It's too much money. Okay. Hold on. We'll be looking

1077
02:54:05,270 --> 02:54:14,090
out on the grid. Still need to build this up here. Just go fast. Really fast. And make the taxes

1078
02:54:14,090 --> 02:54:20,149
fucking crazy. Just make it a hundred percent taxes. Right? Would that be a stupid idea for

1079
02:54:20,149 --> 02:54:33,690
like a few minutes? All right. Here we go. Just for a little bit. Just until I get to a hundred

1080
02:54:33,690 --> 02:54:43,750
thousand dollars. When you start seeing like, hey, hey, hey. I don't like this. Okay. I don't like

1081
02:54:43,750 --> 02:54:52,659
that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. I'm actually getting

1082
02:54:52,659 --> 02:54:59,319
a letter in the mail on like a week to week basis. Hello. This is Mayor Albertson. Just wanted to

1083
02:54:59,319 --> 02:55:05,860
make sure everyone's aware that this week taxes are going up 12 percent. And then next week. Hello,

1084
02:55:05,860 --> 02:55:11,319
Mayor Albertson again. Taxes are going down 12 percent. You would not live here. You'd get

1085
02:55:11,319 --> 02:55:20,059
the fuck out of her as soon as you could. Not enough goods to sell. Not enough workers. 16

1086
02:55:20,059 --> 02:55:35,590
out of 16 workers. I need more people to build the houses. Ice cube factory. We don't need this.

1087
02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:42,790
We don't need an ice cube factory. Okay. What a fucking scam business. That's not even real.

1088
02:55:43,350 --> 02:55:53,850
This is a shell company. I need workers. All right. I need people. Where's my total population?

1089
02:55:56,540 --> 02:56:09,690
I got houses going up, man. I got houses going up. Income from residential zones.

1090
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:19,530
Self-sufficient buildings. All right. Hold on. I got 3,800 people here. How many are not working?

1091
02:56:25,879 --> 02:56:29,559
We need more residential. All right. Let's go. I'm doing a ton more buildings. You got 29,000

1092
02:56:29,559 --> 02:56:35,930
dollars. Highway exit is going to take us this way. All right. You're going to get on the highway

1093
02:56:37,530 --> 02:56:50,809
and you're going to fucking go over here. There you go. From there we got.

1094
02:57:12,819 --> 02:57:15,299
I can just build this out of this way.

1095
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:24,500
This is cursed. Instead of going on the highway, just build this road down here.

1096
02:57:26,139 --> 02:57:33,659
Just down and around. I go visit grandma. I got to go one exit on the highway. She lives

1097
02:57:33,659 --> 02:57:39,459
down the street from me. Everything is abandoned. Why are there no people?

1098
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:51,540
Where are the firefighters? Where are the firefighters? What? Oh, shit. Hold on. I need

1099
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:59,530
to go to the fire zone. Right here. Right here. Right here. Just kick them out. What was here?

1100
02:57:59,530 --> 02:58:09,100
What was this? This is why there's no smoking. There is no smoking allowed in this whole city.

1101
02:58:09,979 --> 02:58:14,700
You motherfuckers. Flick the cigarette. There's no. How do you start a fire here in a park?

1102
02:58:15,670 --> 02:58:27,690
A park. Give me a break. This is unbelievable. No fucking smoking. Oh my god. All right. Open

1103
02:58:27,690 --> 02:58:43,879
the budget panel. Can you put. How do we fix this? Oh, shit. Okay. Electricity. Uh oh. We need.

1104
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:52,729
What is this thing? Advanced wind turbine? That's too much money. This is all too much money.

1105
02:58:53,450 --> 02:58:58,780
All right. One more. Just. Okay. Fine. Fine. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. You got power. Good.

1106
02:59:00,739 --> 02:59:07,000
Is this done? All right. Just delete this. Who comes back and like replants the park?

1107
02:59:07,719 --> 02:59:32,139
Holy shit. This is depressing. Educated teen. Oh, I can't even. What's this?

1108
02:59:34,469 --> 02:59:42,540
Abandoned. Build something else. There's too much trash. There's too much everything.

1109
02:59:43,879 --> 02:59:45,319
They need more educated people.

1110
03:00:01,959 --> 03:00:08,969
Okay. Fuck off. Build something else. This is what I mean. This was trash. Trash. Trash. What's wrong

1111
03:00:08,969 --> 03:00:20,409
with the trash? I need to dump landfill storage. Garbage capacity. Garbage production. A thousand

1112
03:00:20,409 --> 03:00:33,219
units. Should I put this down? Do I need another one? I don't think I need another one. Processing

1113
03:00:33,219 --> 03:00:44,299
status. Why are people abandoning the town? Stop abandoning me. Who are you to say what I say I

1114
03:00:44,299 --> 03:00:47,340
can't do? You're going to smoke in the park and burn it down. Great. Thanks a lot. Big head.

1115
03:00:47,979 --> 03:00:53,899
All right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. You can smoke again. Okay. You can smoke again.

1116
03:00:54,819 --> 03:01:00,500
And no more. You know what? No more free Wi-Fi though. I'm taking that back. No more free Wi-Fi.

1117
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:25,079
Oh fuck. I have to delete this. Did I waste it? Delete. Oh, it's okay. I need the budget panel

1118
03:01:25,079 --> 03:01:31,579
right now. Budget. This is trash. All right. Put education down. They're all idiots anyways.

1119
03:01:31,579 --> 03:01:38,229
You're listening. There we go. Right. We got enough. How much trash are you producing?

1120
03:01:41,639 --> 03:01:44,040
That's not a historical building. It's just some guy's house. Okay.

1121
03:01:48,489 --> 03:01:59,850
Hold on. Let me turn the fucking music down. Wait. A little bit more. Okay. That's good.

1122
03:02:00,649 --> 03:02:06,010
All right. We're good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Hey, wasn't that funny when I fucking made

1123
03:02:06,010 --> 03:02:11,530
this and wasted $35,000? That does no use for it. There's nothing even happening here. They're not

1124
03:02:11,530 --> 03:02:22,200
building over here. Okay. How are we doing? We need workers. I need houses. Oh my god. I'm so

1125
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:25,719
bad at this. I just, I'm too, my brain's too scattered to play this game. All right. Here

1126
03:02:25,719 --> 03:02:29,659
we go. We're going out this way. It's so fun though. This is a fun. Really. This is a really

1127
03:02:29,659 --> 03:02:45,979
good game. Out here. Um, yes. Tons more houses. We need a, and we need schools immediately.

1128
03:03:10,950 --> 03:03:16,540
It's okay. It's all right. Don't worry. All right. So

1129
03:03:20,200 --> 03:03:23,239
more houses he says evicting two households. No, those are two companies.

1130
03:03:23,959 --> 03:03:47,780
All right. We need more income. I just, I'm so scattered. I just can't, I want to connect

1131
03:03:47,780 --> 03:04:23,719
this shit. That looks all right. No, stop with the curve. What do you mean? What the fuck is that?

1132
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:59,590
It's a bunch of residential fucking houses is going here. Okay. This is too scuffed. Just stop.

1133
03:04:59,590 --> 03:05:05,030
Relax. That's my first time. I don't play it. I don't play the city builder. I'm trying to go

1134
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:09,670
for it. I'm going for it. It's the first time. This is my first time. We're playing a city game.

1135
03:05:11,129 --> 03:05:27,940
Um, need houses. A lot of them. And I'm putting, I'm putting the schools and shit in here.

1136
03:05:27,940 --> 03:05:52,299
Wait, can you live? Is this like dog house? I don't understand. Okay. Schools. Elementary school.

1137
03:05:53,180 --> 03:06:05,989
Right on the corner. Bingo. Right there. There you go. Beautiful. Community school. I need a high

1138
03:06:05,989 --> 03:06:48,709
school. High school. Right here. Power and water. They'll get that in a minute. Okay. Shit.

1139
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:25,239
What happened here? What happened here?

1140
03:07:27,659 --> 03:07:32,299
Somebody sneezed on a blueprint. All right. From whatever. I have to do what I have to do.

1141
03:07:35,100 --> 03:07:38,700
You're teaching your mother how to use an iPhone. I've never fucking played this.

1142
03:07:38,700 --> 03:07:42,379
I'm just trying to fun. You know what I mean? It's, I'm actually having a good time. This is a fun

1143
03:07:42,379 --> 03:08:01,260
game. There. Is that working? Is it, is that working? Is that, is it flow here? Is it no flow

1144
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:41,770
here? No flow. Was there flow? Was it a no flow zone? Unpause it. I thought I had like a thousand

1145
03:08:41,770 --> 03:08:55,139
IQ right there. What the fuck are you doing? Okay. We're good. All right. I don't give a shit. It's

1146
03:08:55,139 --> 03:09:03,500
fine. This guy's not going to have water, but fuck him. All right. All right. We need electricity

1147
03:09:03,500 --> 03:09:09,290
and shit. You don't even have fucking goddamn it or whatever. I don't. How much electricity do you

1148
03:09:09,290 --> 03:09:16,729
need? We need water. Fuck. I'm, I'm trying. Okay. We have tons of water. Tons of it. Now,

1149
03:09:16,729 --> 03:09:25,659
we need electricity. Which are we doing? What do we need? I need another. Okay. I need a real plant

1150
03:09:25,659 --> 03:09:58,870
now. Double power. Power plant. Coal power plant. Two. Double the power. Put it over here. This is

1151
03:09:58,870 --> 03:10:07,799
industry. They don't give a shit. Okay. Now how much is this generating? 40. Let's take a look at

1152
03:10:07,799 --> 03:10:16,149
our graph. Electricity protection. 136. We're good. We're connected. We're good to go. How does

1153
03:10:16,149 --> 03:10:25,739
nobody have trash? Do I need another one? I need a second trash facility. Trash facility. Pause it.

1154
03:10:25,739 --> 03:10:36,569
How much trash do I fucking have? Services. Transport. My trash budget. Isn't it? Didn't I

1155
03:10:36,569 --> 03:10:57,780
just put it up? Okay. What do they need? Getting educated. Good. Good to see. Trash gang. Because

1156
03:10:57,780 --> 03:11:04,420
my capacity is still fine for the dump. It's 38% full. Okay. I'm going to make another one.

1157
03:11:05,370 --> 03:11:19,260
I'm making another landfill. Let's go. Perfect. As these houses start to get made,

1158
03:11:22,229 --> 03:11:41,379
you are the dump. What do you mean poop ground? I'm going to put this over here. All right. New

1159
03:11:41,379 --> 03:11:49,719
plan. New plan. New plan. New plan. Sell this. Move it. How do I move it? Relocate. Come here.

1160
03:11:49,719 --> 03:11:56,969
Holy shit. What a 9 million IQ play this is. That secret entrance is not to another house. That

1161
03:11:56,969 --> 03:12:16,899
secret entrance is to the dump. Look at that. They go down into their own trash hole. See?

1162
03:12:17,940 --> 03:12:20,739
You don't have to see them. All the trash goes underneath your neighborhood.

1163
03:12:21,379 --> 03:12:30,420
I should do two of these. All right. 10,000. How are we doing? Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

1164
03:12:30,420 --> 03:12:35,379
We need water. We need electricity. Someone's screaming at me for electricity. What's the

1165
03:12:35,379 --> 03:12:45,909
issue here? Not connected. Well, you will be in about five seconds. All right. And then you're

1166
03:12:45,909 --> 03:12:56,790
connected there. And then you connect. Just build house. Just build. Build. How do you not have any

1167
03:12:56,790 --> 03:13:02,659
water? What the fuck are you talking about? Wait. You don't know how. What? What happened?

1168
03:13:04,360 --> 03:13:17,020
Oh shit. I need another water pump. This is a water pump. Water pumping station. Wait. What is

1169
03:13:17,020 --> 03:13:30,180
this? Oh, that's the dirty water. Don't touch that. And go. Right? Is that correct? There we go. Yeah,

1170
03:13:30,180 --> 03:13:39,139
we're good. All right. Everyone's being a little bit more happy. Is it not connected? It should

1171
03:13:39,139 --> 03:13:49,079
be, right? Was it not connected? No, it is. That's connected, isn't it? No, see? 240,000. It is.

1172
03:13:49,079 --> 03:14:14,020
What about the poop? Drain capacity. Let's take a look. Sewage production. Oh, there we go. Right?

1173
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:25,000
I don't understand how you still have all this trash. How many trucks are in use? 16.

1174
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:31,000
I need another dump facility over here. I have to. Like I, I'm running. I'm running out of time.

1175
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:43,260
I'm out of time. Busy town. More policies. Unique buildings. Sightseeing tours. Oil industry and

1176
03:14:43,260 --> 03:14:59,319
tourism. Hey, I was doing something. Back to back. Come see the secret dump. That's no fucking

1177
03:14:59,319 --> 03:15:10,020
electricity. Wait, whose house is this? Wait, is this like a farm? Is this the guy that owns

1178
03:15:10,020 --> 03:15:19,719
the dump? This is like, this is a farm. Okay. Uh, here we go. Now we connect here to here.

1179
03:15:23,139 --> 03:15:27,059
That's got electricity. This needs water too. Water is coming out here. What are you fucking

1180
03:15:27,059 --> 03:15:36,790
talking about? The secret poop farm. Well, you know, uh, some people, some people have,

1181
03:15:37,750 --> 03:15:45,030
you know, milk, dairy production. Some people have corn and maize and all that. Nah, for me,

1182
03:15:45,030 --> 03:15:57,829
nah, it's, it's all trash. Trash farm. What's wrong with our garbage collections? Trash is piled up.

1183
03:15:57,829 --> 03:16:06,680
It's flied everywhere. I'm 16. I need another, do I actually need more of these? We'll fucking

1184
03:16:06,680 --> 03:16:13,959
just make another one right here. I'm doing another one. Just stack them all up here and have

1185
03:16:13,959 --> 03:16:20,120
this guy have a farm. Imagine, look at uneducated. Should he have his own elementary school?

1186
03:16:22,299 --> 03:16:33,540
This is somebody else's house. Holy shit. Imagine in the summer. Imagine you're the person that

1187
03:16:33,540 --> 03:16:41,500
occupies this room during the summer. Oh wow. What a bright, beautiful sunny day that's outside.

1188
03:16:41,819 --> 03:16:45,899
I think I'll open up the window and get some air and cool off my room.

1189
03:16:53,559 --> 03:17:04,549
Nevermind. Holy shit, that'd be so bad. But the one good thing is you can just,

1190
03:17:04,549 --> 03:17:09,750
you wouldn't even need to pay for trash. You could just come out your door with bags of trash and

1191
03:17:09,750 --> 03:17:20,170
just whip them over the side. Honey, we still need this TV. No, no, we don't,

1192
03:17:20,170 --> 03:17:26,649
we don't need that TV anymore. It's kind of doesn't work, does it? Well, I'll get rid of it.

1193
03:17:26,649 --> 03:17:40,360
I'll be careful. I'll be okay. Hold on. I got it. I got it. Okay. Just go out the door.

1194
03:17:41,159 --> 03:17:43,219
I'm out the front door now.

1195
03:17:51,739 --> 03:18:06,760
That was easy. We have any more stuff? Hey, son, open up your window. Let's check the trajectory.

1196
03:18:10,780 --> 03:18:16,540
Check the trajectory. Yeah, if we get, son, if we take the sofa and we fucking go as fast as we can

1197
03:18:16,540 --> 03:18:23,670
and throw it out your window, we'll get there, I think. Okay, let's try. Tilt yours this way.

1198
03:18:24,229 --> 03:18:30,700
Tilt it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. No, no, push. Push. All right. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.

1199
03:18:32,219 --> 03:18:49,940
Okay. Let it go. Good. Good shot, son. Good shot. Good work. You made it. I

1200
03:18:49,940 --> 03:19:06,459
didn't think we were going to have enough speed. It went into the street at the wrong window.

1201
03:19:06,459 --> 03:19:23,020
No, no, that's not. No, they threw it out here. All right. Well, fuck it. Who cares? They'll be

1202
03:19:23,020 --> 03:19:37,590
fine. You know, I own my own dumpster. I make a lot of money, so I decided to make the Statue of

1203
03:19:37,590 --> 03:19:44,549
Liberty back here. My own personal Statue of Liberty for me. I charge people money to come use it.

1204
03:19:44,549 --> 03:19:49,079
I have to take on with a loan to put the Statue of Liberty next to the guy's

1205
03:19:49,079 --> 03:19:58,389
dump farm. No, no, no. No, I need to work on this. How are we doing? What do we need?

1206
03:19:58,389 --> 03:20:03,270
We need more industry. More industry. How educated are people? We're good?

1207
03:20:04,149 --> 03:20:07,909
People are smarter now. What's happening? What happened here? This house is dead.

1208
03:20:07,909 --> 03:20:18,579
The house died. A dead person is waiting for transport. What? Nobody says dead in the house.

1209
03:20:20,620 --> 03:20:28,620
Oh, these streets are too small. Look at these, like, dump trucks and these, like, gas companies.

1210
03:20:30,549 --> 03:20:35,190
This fucking... There's, like, thousands of pounds of gravel going through here.

1211
03:20:37,190 --> 03:20:41,670
Like, oil and shit. There's nobody... This is not, like, a residential neighborhood.

1212
03:20:43,340 --> 03:20:49,799
Oh, I need to have, like, a different, bigger road to bring trash and stuff.

1213
03:20:49,799 --> 03:20:57,639
Oh, and I thought the clown was going to come pick up the dead person.

1214
03:20:58,360 --> 03:21:07,000
All right. How do I... What do you... I need a cemetery? Oh, shit. Okay. How do I make a

1215
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:15,059
cemetery? Wait, I need police. What is this? Police headquarters. I don't know.

1216
03:21:15,700 --> 03:21:26,709
Put it next to the dump. No, no, no. People are dead. All right. I need... I need some hospital.

1217
03:21:27,270 --> 03:21:32,520
Medical clinic. All right. I don't have one over here. Okay. Medical clinic over right here.

1218
03:21:32,520 --> 03:21:36,760
In this new area that I've made. Right here. Right here. This is perfect, right? Two medical...

1219
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:41,450
People are dead. People are dying. How about right...

1220
03:21:43,290 --> 03:21:49,379
Right here. And then one right here. Okay. And I need another doctor's office over here. Right

1221
03:21:49,379 --> 03:22:08,870
at the corner. Okay. We're good. Click link. What? Why? What the hell is going on? Is there a family...

1222
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:20,870
Wait. Dude, this is a Daily Mail website. There's like 600 ads on Daily Mail. Hold on a second.

1223
03:22:20,870 --> 03:22:28,680
There's like 40 ads that are on Daily Mail. Why did you leave me a Daily Mail article?

1224
03:22:28,680 --> 03:22:38,120
Oh my God. This is unbelievable. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. There are seven.

1225
03:22:39,180 --> 03:22:49,959
Seven separate ads. Some of them are playing fucking music on this website. Holy shit, man.

1226
03:22:50,520 --> 03:22:59,190
That's unbelievable. And if you have an ad blocker on, they yell at you. They get angry with you.

1227
03:22:59,190 --> 03:23:03,989
If you have... Excuse me. I thought you had an ad blocker off. Turn it off so we could deposit

1228
03:23:03,989 --> 03:23:09,979
five fucking thousand ads into your face. Anyways, misery of the fam is living in a cul-de-sac

1229
03:23:09,979 --> 03:23:15,579
that's been stuck next to a stinking 18,000 ton waste mountain for three years. Holy shit,

1230
03:23:15,579 --> 03:23:30,700
this is horrible. Oh my God. It's the same place. What the fuck? Holy shit. This is terrible. This

1231
03:23:30,700 --> 03:23:51,510
is actually awful. Okay. I have an ad on the side of this page for a toilet, but it's a small toilet.

1232
03:23:53,270 --> 03:24:01,270
It's a toilet that shoots water up your ass. What? It's a little toilet that dad has... I don't

1233
03:24:01,270 --> 03:24:08,760
understand. It's a bidet. Oh, all right. I need some... You guys have to help me out here.

1234
03:24:09,559 --> 03:24:14,540
This is going to be a conversation. If you're eating, I would say probably stop for a little

1235
03:24:14,540 --> 03:24:20,469
bit. Just don't eat for a minute. Just take your last bite. I'll wait. Swallow it and just hear...

1236
03:24:20,469 --> 03:24:25,799
Okay, because this is going to be disgusting. Okay. Very important question. I've heard,

1237
03:24:26,739 --> 03:24:34,139
hey, I can't believe a bidet changed everything. Oh, wow. It's so much better with a bidet.

1238
03:24:34,139 --> 03:24:43,000
And I think about this sometimes. After you've used the bathroom, wouldn't shooting water into...

1239
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:49,989
Okay. Wouldn't shooting water into your ass make... Like you just... Gross water go all over your legs

1240
03:24:49,989 --> 03:24:53,909
and your butt cheeks and stuff. I've told you this is going to be a fucking 18 plus conversation.

1241
03:24:57,819 --> 03:25:02,059
I'm just... I need to know. I'm curious. I've never... I've always... It just works.

1242
03:25:02,059 --> 03:25:18,579
Just sitting down. But I feel like it would be like disgusting. It's not a hose, dude.

1243
03:25:27,340 --> 03:25:37,219
Somebody said it's a drinking fountain. Can you imagine? Holy shit. That's fucking crazy.

1244
03:25:47,829 --> 03:26:02,520
I don't know. I just don't know. I'm trying to be educated on this. You don't need... You don't need

1245
03:26:02,520 --> 03:26:12,780
to use toilet paper. What? No fucking way. That's unheard of to me. That is unheard of to me. That's

1246
03:26:12,780 --> 03:26:19,000
no. I would never. I can't... No way. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. That doesn't work. That doesn't work.

1247
03:26:19,000 --> 03:26:24,659
It doesn't work. That doesn't work. That doesn't work. No, it does not. No way. No fucking way.

1248
03:26:24,659 --> 03:26:30,260
How do you dry your ass off? You just sit there and let water hit you all over the ass and you

1249
03:26:30,260 --> 03:26:36,860
put your pants and underwear back on? How do you dry off your ass? You don't use toilet paper

1250
03:26:36,860 --> 03:26:46,540
anymore. You're putting water all over your back and your body. So you have water clean you and

1251
03:26:46,540 --> 03:26:53,100
then you just pull your underwear back up. When you have like a big water stain on your ass,

1252
03:26:57,180 --> 03:27:01,260
what if it misses? What if you're not sitting in the right way? What if you're like shimmying

1253
03:27:01,260 --> 03:27:04,860
around or something? What if you like move in the right wrong direction? Just hit boom right on the

1254
03:27:04,860 --> 03:27:11,340
side and then oh shit. Now what? What do we do to adjust? Am I going to sit there and just like

1255
03:27:11,340 --> 03:27:19,030
power wash the whole back side of my body until I get it in the right place?

1256
03:27:19,030 --> 03:27:24,709
Dude, is there like an app that you open up on on your phone that you like aim the nozzle?

1257
03:27:25,350 --> 03:27:29,989
How does this work? Calm down. I'm not gonna calm down on this one.

1258
03:27:48,549 --> 03:27:55,500
Do it. You have to, you have to fuck. It's a button you press. Yeah, I know, but what if you're in

1259
03:27:55,500 --> 03:28:02,790
like the wrong spot? Is it possible that it'll hit you in like the back? What if it's not tweaked

1260
03:28:02,790 --> 03:28:08,139
enough? What if it didn't like hit you right like in the swell of your back and go like off your

1261
03:28:08,139 --> 03:28:22,620
back? It shoots you and like hits you in the back of the head. You guys are fucking cracking me the

1262
03:28:22,620 --> 03:28:55,620
fuck up right now. It's like, what are you doing? A handstand on the toilet? I need more industry.

1263
03:28:55,620 --> 03:29:07,620
Hold on. All right, I gotta go back to playing the game. Okay. All right. Seriously, how do you

1264
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:14,469
stop people from dying? Where's the cemetery? What is this? A jumpy house? Oh, fuck that. I'm

1265
03:29:14,469 --> 03:29:31,930
doing a jumpy house first. It's going right here. Point. Cemetery. Botanical garden. No, I need a

1266
03:29:31,930 --> 03:29:44,409
cemetery. Is it fucking carousel? Oh shit. Come on. Right, right at the front at the entrance of the

1267
03:29:44,409 --> 03:30:27,319
park. Okay, good. Fix the streets. I can't. Oh, wait. No, fuck. This is gonna be like, all right,

1268
03:30:27,319 --> 03:30:39,159
I got it. Check this out. I need this to be two way, two way. There comes a fucking theme park.

1269
03:30:39,239 --> 03:30:53,079
Four lanes. This is both two ways. Here we go. Uh, it don't matter. That's fine. This is like,

1270
03:30:53,079 --> 03:31:00,469
I'll look anything be like a little amusement park. All right. What do we got? I'm on. Oh,

1271
03:31:00,469 --> 03:31:27,879
look at this. Oh, like a Japanese garden. Uh, and botanical garden. We're gonna put this up here.

1272
03:31:27,879 --> 03:31:38,709
Botanical garden is going to go right in the middle. Right. I want it like right in here.

1273
03:31:38,709 --> 03:31:47,110
Now that's already parked there. Right here. Botanical garden. I make all these people happy

1274
03:31:47,110 --> 03:32:04,200
right there. Boom. Jeremy, here's a diagram for a bidet. You motherfuckers. Oh my god. Where's,

1275
03:32:04,200 --> 03:32:20,200
okay. Where is a cemetery? Emergency services. Fire station. I need a cemetery. Health. Medical

1276
03:32:20,200 --> 03:32:37,319
lab. Medical clinic. Scrematorium. Sauna. Cemetery. Okay. Here we go. Cemetery. Cemetery next to the,

1277
03:32:38,200 --> 03:32:44,250
I can't. How about up here? No, they can only take those people. All right. We need, it's gonna be

1278
03:32:44,250 --> 03:32:54,299
away. How about, um, all right. There'll be a cemetery over this way. That makes the most

1279
03:32:54,299 --> 03:33:06,729
sense to me. We'll have two. One over here and one over here. Here. Excuse me. Here. Excuse me.

1280
03:33:06,729 --> 03:33:20,420
Excuse me. I'm trying to get over here. Excuse me. Fuck. Come on. It's too steep. What the fuck are

1281
03:33:20,420 --> 03:33:26,500
you, what do you mean it's too steep? It's a, you're going to be burying people, right? I don't

1282
03:33:26,500 --> 03:33:34,299
understand. What do you mean it's too steep for what? Who should I call if nobody comes to pick

1283
03:33:34,299 --> 03:33:47,540
the dead up? Oh, it's a mountain. I have to go all the way up the mountain. Oh, it's okay. Just get

1284
03:33:47,540 --> 03:34:21,180
it. Come on. Where's the terrain tool? Flatten this shit out. That happens really fast. What?

1285
03:34:27,059 --> 03:34:39,989
Oh, it's a volcano. What do I, what is this? It's shift terrain. Level terrain. Wait,

1286
03:34:40,629 --> 03:34:45,750
level area. Click the secondary mouse button to choose target height. Oh, fucking God. Really?

1287
03:34:46,389 --> 03:35:29,829
Dude, I'm trying to level this shit. I mean, refund. What the fuck? How do I make this circle

1288
03:35:29,829 --> 03:36:53,590
bigger? Here we go. Okay. God damn it. Hey, there we go. Come no more urns on the mantle place.

1289
03:36:53,590 --> 03:36:57,909
And it's way the fuck away for everybody. So we don't, that's a far way to go. It's okay.

1290
03:36:57,909 --> 03:37:14,870
Oh shit. They need water and electricity over here. Right. Okay. What about electric? Electric.

1291
03:37:14,870 --> 03:37:18,389
Ooh, I can go from here. No, that's too far. Let's go like this. That's going to be really

1292
03:37:18,389 --> 03:37:23,590
ugly if I do this though, isn't it? Oh, that's super ugly. Way too ugly. That's too ugly. That's

1293
03:37:23,590 --> 03:37:37,850
ugly. Oh, that's, that's ugly. Look at how ugly this is. Oh, it's ugly. I don't like it. Whatever.

1294
03:37:37,850 --> 03:37:48,010
Okay. So now there's a place for people to drop off dead bodies, but it's away from everybody.

1295
03:37:48,010 --> 03:37:56,229
It's not over here. This house is abandoned. Just delete it. See, they're happy. Get rid of that

1296
03:37:56,229 --> 03:38:04,329
place. This is, yeah, look at us. Get out of here. We need organic foods, not enough goods to sell.

1297
03:38:05,049 --> 03:38:14,520
Oh, poor industry. I need a lot more. Okay. We need another industrial area. Over here.

1298
03:38:15,540 --> 03:38:29,049
No, this way. Industry. A huge ass road. Highway with sound barrier. No. Wait,

1299
03:38:29,049 --> 03:39:23,180
I can put an intersection. Ooh, look at this. This is cool. I don't know. I don't know, guys.

1300
03:39:23,180 --> 03:39:29,899
I don't do this stuff. I don't know much about this stuff. I don't know.

1301
03:39:32,059 --> 03:39:43,139
I don't know about this stuff. I don't know. It's just, oh, shit. Oh, shit. I just put a light

1302
03:39:43,700 --> 03:39:53,530
on the highway. There's a light on the highway. As you go in 60, 70 miles per hour and you have

1303
03:39:53,530 --> 03:40:10,389
to stop the red light here. Holy shit, that's so bad. The Statue of Liberty in the middle.

1304
03:40:11,030 --> 03:40:21,180
Oh, my chest. This is just a drive-by. Okay, the Statue of Liberty is going right in the middle.

1305
03:40:21,180 --> 03:40:28,500
You just drive around it. That is shitty attraction. You just drive around the Statue

1306
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:37,139
of Liberty in a circle and you get back on the highway. Coming up soon, the Statue of Liberty.

1307
03:40:37,139 --> 03:40:42,420
Oh, honey, we're going to go see that. And you get off and you just go around the roundabout

1308
03:40:42,420 --> 03:40:48,219
and you get back on the fucking highway and go back to what you're doing and surrounded with

1309
03:40:48,219 --> 03:41:03,319
stumps. What do you want me to click on? This is fucking funny to me. Oh, that's hilarious.

1310
03:41:03,319 --> 03:41:14,469
I'm glad I clicked that. All right, we need more educated people. Oh, this sounds so bad.

1311
03:41:15,430 --> 03:41:31,559
I need, okay, well, how much is the Statue of Liberty? $210,000. Come on, I can just put it on

1312
03:41:31,559 --> 03:41:51,299
the highway. Wait, I can put it on the highway. Like here. Holy shit, that's the stupidest thing.

1313
03:41:54,790 --> 03:42:14,729
I can't. What is this? A winter market? Is this an Eiffel Tower? I can't put a landfill

1314
03:42:15,290 --> 03:42:23,129
in the middle, guys. I can't. Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire. Where's the fire department?

1315
03:42:24,090 --> 03:42:34,899
Fire, fire. Put it out. We're good. All right, what was I doing? Right, something over here.

1316
03:42:35,620 --> 03:42:41,700
I was deleting these two buildings. I was deleting these three buildings.

1317
03:42:42,340 --> 03:42:47,979
All right, let's make, I need more industry. Industry, industry, industry.

1318
03:42:47,979 --> 03:42:57,059
Over here. Industry, up this way. Industry. Let's go. Road. Industry. Out. Up. All industry.

1319
03:42:57,780 --> 03:43:51,059
Only industry. Industry only. I need more than that. What the fuck is this? I don't know. I'm

1320
03:43:51,059 --> 03:44:04,500
just trying to make it. Wait, they have to get on the, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1321
03:44:04,500 --> 03:44:15,270
wait, wait. Wait, you have to get back on the highway. Oh, shit. Okay, you have to get on the

1322
03:44:15,270 --> 03:44:26,459
highway and go all the way around the whole fucking state. Oh, shit. Hold on. Wait, wait,

1323
03:44:26,459 --> 03:44:29,100
wait, wait, wait, wait. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can fix it. I can

1324
03:44:29,100 --> 03:44:36,760
fix it. Pause the game. It's so fucked up. I'm right here. Okay, here we go. You can either

1325
03:44:36,760 --> 03:44:41,799
get on the highway or you can go check out our fucking industry. It sounds good to me. Good.

1326
03:44:42,040 --> 03:44:49,930
Okay, we're fine. Okay, then you go this way and you go over here. Go around, around, around.

1327
03:44:53,899 --> 03:44:56,700
I can't. I can't do it.

1328
03:45:02,420 --> 03:45:16,139
Oh, and over here. No, this is so fucked up. Okay, delete this. I could go from here to here.

1329
03:45:20,540 --> 03:45:33,500
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Just from here. From here to here. There. That's better.

1330
03:45:33,579 --> 03:45:40,069
Okay, now that makes much more sense. Put a road in the roundabout. Wait, what do you mean

1331
03:45:40,069 --> 03:46:12,840
put a road in the roundabout? Let's see if it uses it. This is so confusing. I don't even know how

1332
03:46:12,840 --> 03:46:22,409
this would work. So, hold on. If you go around the roundabout, you can go in here and go in and then

1333
03:46:22,409 --> 03:46:43,110
left. That's, I gotta delete this. It's too fucked up. The whole purpose of a roundabout is to

1334
03:46:43,110 --> 03:47:01,129
not have to have something like this. No one's using it. Oh, they will. They'll have to.

1335
03:47:01,129 --> 03:47:09,930
Especially if you lived there. Oh, we need, we need water. Help. Help. Help. I can do better than

1336
03:47:09,930 --> 03:47:14,409
that. Help. That's better. All right. I need, I need, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1337
03:47:14,409 --> 03:47:51,850
Oh, we good. Oh, we good. Why can I not go down here? I mean, it's already occupied. What the fuck

1338
03:47:51,850 --> 03:48:01,690
are you talking about? This is stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid. All right,

1339
03:48:01,690 --> 03:48:07,690
let me go like this. There we go. Electric. How much electricity are we using? This game's fucking

1340
03:48:07,690 --> 03:48:27,420
cool. 136. I need to do more electricity. How about more wind farms? Ooh, what's this? Oil plant.

1341
03:48:27,420 --> 03:48:36,790
Okay, let's go. Where's industry center? This is industry over here, right? This is industry,

1342
03:48:36,790 --> 03:48:43,110
right? Yeah, this is industry. Let's put the oil plant over here. Can you do an American accent?

1343
03:48:44,899 --> 03:48:50,180
Uh, America is an incredibly, incredibly deep. It's a lot of different accents in America.

1344
03:48:50,180 --> 03:48:59,940
There's like 15. I don't know. What are you talking about? All right. I want power. Oh, power plant.

1345
03:48:59,940 --> 03:49:12,870
$50,000. Here we go. It's very loud. Wait, this is too much money. Check the traffic map. How do I

1346
03:49:12,870 --> 03:49:28,280
do that? How do I check the traffic map? How do I do that? Top left. The info of views. Levels. Prime.

1347
03:49:38,549 --> 03:50:02,739
Just wind levels. Transport. Cars. I'm leaning the fuck into my screen right now. I don't see a car.

1348
03:50:05,690 --> 03:50:10,409
Escape routes. Meteorologists have issued a severe tornado warning for the area.

1349
03:50:10,409 --> 03:50:14,170
What? Residents should seek shelter immediately if any is available.

1350
03:50:15,209 --> 03:50:20,520
What are we talking about? Where? About to hit the tornado is going to hit the fucking city?

1351
03:50:25,700 --> 03:50:43,350
Huh? 1.5 is about to hit the city. How do I help them? A tornado has touched down in the area.

1352
03:50:43,350 --> 03:50:48,409
Seek shelter immediately if any is available. It's going to miss us. It's all right. It's going to

1353
03:50:48,409 --> 03:50:54,809
miss. It's going to miss us. It's going to miss us. It's going to, it's, it's, we're just going to

1354
03:50:54,809 --> 03:51:18,709
get missed by the storm. It's going to, uh-oh. No, everybody get out of the way. Get your.

1355
03:51:18,709 --> 03:51:55,190
All right. How do we rebuild this? We don't. All right. Repair the road. Is she coming back?

1356
03:51:56,069 --> 03:52:05,450
Repair. All right. Everybody, everyone's fine. We're okay. All right. Our industry,

1357
03:52:05,450 --> 03:52:12,840
we've got to get some more. We're going to build that back. Okay. So I'm going to say where's the

1358
03:52:12,840 --> 03:52:27,959
traffic? Tours. Tourism. Road maintenance. Park maintenance. Traffic. Traffic becomes congested.

1359
03:52:27,959 --> 03:52:31,159
People have a hard time getting to work and back. Production slows down when resource and

1360
03:52:31,159 --> 03:52:43,420
goods sit in trucks. Actually pretty fucking good. Pretty good actually. A little bit of some

1361
03:52:43,420 --> 03:52:53,479
congestion here. I can fix that. I can fix that. Oh yeah. This is bad. This sucks. All right. Here

1362
03:52:53,479 --> 03:53:01,690
we go. Fresh water. Why are you out without, what are you talking about? What are you guys,

1363
03:53:01,690 --> 03:53:14,700
what the fuck are you talking about? What? I took out the power plant. Oh, you fucking motherfucker.

1364
03:53:26,760 --> 03:53:32,469
All right. All right. All right. We're good. What about the, somebody's complaining about water.

1365
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:45,190
I got $110,000 looking good. Is this building on fire? No. Save the game. Oh, that would be nice.

1366
03:53:45,909 --> 03:53:57,319
Sure. Auto-save. All right. So the traffic ain't that bad. Oh, I got to fix it. This is a big

1367
03:53:57,319 --> 03:54:05,860
problem though. Uh, I need to widen this road with a super road. A six lane road is going to go here.

1368
03:54:07,430 --> 03:54:13,750
Free up some of that traffic. Look at that flow. Look at that flow. Now it flows. Yes.

1369
03:54:18,659 --> 03:54:30,579
Wait. Okay. That's better. Look at that flow. Not, not a good flow on this one though.

1370
03:54:31,540 --> 03:54:35,270
This is going to destroy any, uh, this is not going to remove any businesses, right?

1371
03:54:37,700 --> 03:54:45,780
But a huge fucking road. More. Here we go. Now this is what we're talking about. You're going

1372
03:54:45,780 --> 03:54:58,659
residential. You're going this way. Look at that big intersection. Lots of upgrading the ability.

1373
03:55:00,489 --> 03:55:05,290
Looking good. Okay. Now we don't have to go too crazy. We've got our big main road, our huge,

1374
03:55:07,059 --> 03:55:16,069
huge thing here. Very good. All right. This is pretty good. This is pretty good over here.

1375
03:55:16,069 --> 03:55:23,059
We need some more trash collection. $122,000. Let's go. Any houses going to get built here?

1376
03:55:23,059 --> 03:55:29,000
All right. LinkedIn city is doing pretty good. Good morning, everybody. What a beautiful sunrise.

1377
03:55:32,629 --> 03:55:36,549
Imagine rolling out of bed first thing in the morning. You just open your eyes and you're

1378
03:55:36,549 --> 03:55:42,219
groggy and you just grab your phone and tweet. Good morning. Good morning. Before even brushing

1379
03:55:42,219 --> 03:55:53,590
your teeth. We're awesome districts. Jerma face. I still don't really understand that.

1380
03:55:54,469 --> 03:56:04,389
Wait, we have some more city stuff. Prefer very hot recycled. Prefer parks. Book fair.

1381
03:56:05,110 --> 03:56:15,799
The local public libraries organize a book fair. City planning. Ban heavy traffic on an area.

1382
03:56:17,209 --> 03:56:32,540
Encourage biking. Bike ban on sidewalks. No loud noises in the night. Old town. Only residents

1383
03:56:32,540 --> 03:56:39,319
of business can use the area from motor vehicles. Ban of the motor traffic. Filter boost workers

1384
03:56:39,319 --> 03:57:05,129
union. No rebuilding. I need another police station. Police. We need one. There's one there.

1385
03:57:05,129 --> 03:57:11,610
We need one over here. Right there. Looks all right. And we need another one up here.

1386
03:57:11,690 --> 03:57:23,700
Around the corner. Right here. Right down here. We gotta protect the industry, right?

1387
03:57:25,129 --> 03:57:41,239
Can people rob industry? Or is it only residential? Both. Okay. Let's get this in a spot where like

1388
03:57:42,600 --> 03:57:54,700
what's over here? I don't want to delete too much shit. Okay. We need one over here. Just police.

1389
03:57:54,700 --> 03:58:02,149
Police. Police. Everywhere. Good. And down here. One police station over here. Good. Now we're

1390
03:58:02,149 --> 03:58:12,790
protected. Completely. And a police station down here. And a police headquarters. Okay, what does

1391
03:58:12,790 --> 03:58:20,180
it do? Police presence helps control the crime rate. Keep citizens safe. All right. The police

1392
03:58:20,180 --> 03:58:33,850
headquarters is going to be around the highway. No. Oh shit. This place needs water. They got

1393
03:58:33,850 --> 03:58:47,770
electricity though, right? People actually live here. It's just people constantly. Remove all

1394
03:58:47,770 --> 03:58:56,620
more police stations than schools. You're right. Wait. College. Institute of Creative Arts.

1395
03:58:57,420 --> 03:59:08,360
Institute of Creative Arts. Does the red mean that they're really stupid? Here we go. Right here.

1396
03:59:09,940 --> 03:59:19,659
Right here. Perfect spot for it. Right in the middle. Boom. The new Institute of Creative Arts

1397
03:59:19,659 --> 03:59:28,500
is going to implement new creative ways of teaching art. Wait, is it art school? Oh shit.

1398
03:59:29,059 --> 03:59:38,700
No, no, no. There's only one school and it's an art school.

1399
03:59:39,819 --> 03:59:48,200
No, I want it to be like a general college. Public library. High school. Another high school?

1400
03:59:48,760 --> 04:00:07,590
Where are the dumbest people located? Over here. Space Occupy. We'll knock it down. It's okay.

1401
04:00:08,950 --> 04:00:14,170
It's a college. They get a general education. That's fine. All right. How are we doing over

1402
04:00:14,170 --> 04:00:19,610
here? We need more workers. I'm working on it. Oh, we need the fucking industrial building.

1403
04:00:20,250 --> 04:00:28,629
Ugh. The industrial building's not going to... The oil building's not going to hire a fucking painter.

1404
04:00:29,430 --> 04:00:46,260
We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. They might. They might. That's true. All right. I've got

1405
04:00:46,260 --> 04:00:54,950
schools. More. I need hospitals. Medical helicopter. I need a hospital. How much? $65,000? Increased

1406
04:00:54,950 --> 04:01:06,059
tax. All right. Let's take a look at our budget here. Trash a little bit more. Schools a little

1407
04:01:06,059 --> 04:01:14,360
bit less. Police a little bit less. Fire a little bit more. Hospitals a little bit more.

1408
04:01:17,059 --> 04:01:33,770
Industry areas a little bit more. Zero dollars? Why are they getting zero dollars? Because they

1409
04:01:33,770 --> 04:01:46,760
don't exist. This is just throwing money into a hole. What's the bottom one? What is this?

1410
04:01:46,760 --> 04:02:00,149
What's the top? Is the top and bottom lever? What are they for? Day and night. Oh, shit. Okay.

1411
04:02:00,709 --> 04:02:17,219
All right. Taxes. Let's go. You got to pay a little bit more. Seriously. Come on.

1412
04:02:17,780 --> 04:02:29,750
15, 20% to industry. Let's go. Only for like a few weeks. Promise. Big town, campus area,

1413
04:02:29,750 --> 04:02:37,379
taxation policies, sports arenas, trade school. All right. That's 110,000. Look at this shit.

1414
04:02:39,100 --> 04:02:41,579
More, more, more, more money, more money, more money, more money, more money, more money,

1415
04:02:41,579 --> 04:02:44,620
money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1416
04:02:44,620 --> 04:02:53,500
Take a blimp. What the hell would I need a blimp for? What's with the water works?

1417
04:02:58,620 --> 04:03:11,049
All right. Bring it down. 12%, 12%, 12%. Let's do 11%, 13%, and 14%. What is this?

1418
04:03:12,280 --> 04:03:21,000
High density residential zone? All right. 12%, 14%, 12%, 14%. I'm just picking random numbers.

1419
04:03:21,079 --> 04:03:34,010
Build high density now. Wait. Trash. I need another dump. How's Dump City doing over here? Oh,

1420
04:03:34,010 --> 04:03:45,930
they've expanded. Dump City has... Well, they actually are doing pretty well. Speaking of

1421
04:03:45,930 --> 04:03:55,700
dumps. I need more commercial areas. Right here. Whoa. High density commercial zone.

1422
04:03:57,209 --> 04:04:00,489
Department stores and supermarkets that offer citizens a wide variety of spending possibilities.

1423
04:04:00,489 --> 04:04:06,139
So this is big, big shit. All right. How about over here? This is a pretty good spot for it.

1424
04:04:06,139 --> 04:04:29,860
We're off the highway. All right. What's going on here? Oh, they're already going up. What's

1425
04:04:29,860 --> 04:04:34,739
happening over here? Oh, right. This stupid dumb thing that I built. A fun, like a dumb joke. Turn

1426
04:04:34,739 --> 04:05:09,590
it into a fucking mall. That's fine. Okay. Let's go like this. All right. We're good. Electricity

1427
04:05:10,229 --> 04:05:14,549
is already coming down here. How much do I need? I'm about to be... I'm about to need to do more.

1428
04:05:15,590 --> 04:05:25,459
I need a dump. Incineration plant. Ooh. Instead of collecting garbage, why not burn it?

1429
04:05:26,280 --> 04:05:42,260
And turn it into electricity. The power of steam turbines. Yeah. Let's go. Have it back here.

1430
04:05:42,260 --> 04:05:52,520
Right on the edge. Yeah. Whatever. You fine. Turning trash into energy is a win-win situation.

1431
04:05:54,620 --> 04:06:06,579
Yeah, it is. Chat. Chat. Hey guys. What do all the industries win ThinkCity? What are you fucking

1432
04:06:06,579 --> 04:06:18,340
talking about? I need... Okay. I need college. Here we go. Modern Technology Institute. Bingo.

1433
04:06:18,899 --> 04:06:44,100
I gotta put this over here. Where's that other college? Right in the middle. $90,000. Right there.

1434
04:06:44,100 --> 04:06:52,149
There you go. Now you're going to be fucking real smart. The people are going to be too intelligent.

1435
04:06:52,149 --> 04:06:58,809
Oh, I was about to delete your building. Cool. Look at that. That's a nice little view.

1436
04:06:59,530 --> 04:07:09,799
All right. This is building. Everything's looking all right. We need some more residential.

1437
04:07:10,440 --> 04:07:15,850
What's wrong here? I need more workers. I'm working on it. All right. What about the trade

1438
04:07:15,850 --> 04:07:23,450
schools, right? We need those. This is a university. Why did I build like this super school?

1439
04:07:26,250 --> 04:07:38,979
Earthquake could hit the area soon. Tornadoes and earthquakes? All right. Do it like over here.

1440
04:07:44,629 --> 04:07:56,569
Please do not do it to the fucking dump. Don't do it to the dump family. Come on. Oh God. Oh,

1441
04:07:56,569 --> 04:08:02,489
I just built this. An earthquake is occurring. Oh my God. I thought that was... Wait for help

1442
04:08:02,489 --> 04:08:19,420
if you are in the affected area. That was $90,000. God's wrath. What's this filling?

1443
04:08:20,059 --> 04:08:29,350
What's this mean? Sewage is backing up. What? Oh, fuck. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1444
04:08:29,350 --> 04:08:35,850
What am I supposed to do? What do I do? How do I steal the sewage? Sewage is backed up.

1445
04:08:39,100 --> 04:08:44,840
Somebody's house is on fire. Do I have any police officers? I need another drain.

1446
04:08:47,479 --> 04:08:56,899
What? I don't understand. They're all here. They're all here. Pause it. I don't understand.

1447
04:08:59,479 --> 04:09:26,819
Sewage is backing up. Oh, it's because of this. Stupid motherfucker. What about the eggs? Okay.

1448
04:09:29,659 --> 04:09:37,420
Oh, these are broken and fucked up. No, these are all right. Okay. Sewage is backing up,

1449
04:09:37,420 --> 04:09:46,379
but I solved it. Did I solve it? It's solved. All right. Here we go. Okay.

1450
04:09:47,020 --> 04:09:56,979
Relax everybody. Just... Yeah. All right. So what happened? Some things got broken.

1451
04:09:57,540 --> 04:10:07,299
Oops. Come on, mate. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1452
04:10:07,299 --> 04:10:15,139
What about my beautiful road? Six roads, six lanes. Shit. Wait. My beautiful road.

1453
04:10:15,700 --> 04:10:30,700
My beautiful road. Oh, shit. What the fuck is happening? There's a crater in the earth.

1454
04:10:31,850 --> 04:10:42,569
No, dude. Why is this happening right now? Hold on. How is sewage backing up? What happened? What do

1455
04:10:42,569 --> 04:10:52,260
you mean there's no electricity? What the fuck are you talking about? Oh my God. Pause the fucking

1456
04:10:52,260 --> 04:11:17,780
game. Jeez. God damn it, man. Okay. How much power do I have? Money. Okay. What the fuck?

1457
04:11:18,340 --> 04:11:29,459
I got to fix this road. This whole area is messed up. Look at this. People have like

1458
04:11:29,459 --> 04:11:43,350
craters in their backyard. Rebuilding. We're rebuilding. I can't believe they took out the

1459
04:11:43,350 --> 04:11:57,620
university of all the things. Just built the damn thing. How do you not have water? Oh, fuck off.

1460
04:11:57,780 --> 04:12:08,090
$90,000 just deleted. All right. I got to redo this shit. This is all messed up. Pause it.

1461
04:12:10,700 --> 04:12:20,760
The road's out here. Just demolish this. I need to... Okay. What the hell is happening?

1462
04:12:21,399 --> 04:12:31,209
This is... What happened here? I need to go from here. From here to here. Give me the terrain.

1463
04:12:36,500 --> 04:12:44,950
Haha. Yeah. Good. Yes. I want to... Isn't this flattened to terrain? What the fuck?

1464
04:12:49,659 --> 04:13:24,459
Flatten. Fucking God. It's on the mountain. It's on flattened. Level terrain. There we go.

1465
04:13:33,059 --> 04:13:53,510
There we are. Okay. There we go. Back to normal. Back to normal. Clap. He did it. Clap. Ehee. He

1466
04:13:53,510 --> 04:14:22,809
did it. Ehee. He did. What happened here? I don't care. Fix these fucking roads. Good. Bring this

1467
04:14:23,450 --> 04:14:37,079
down. I'm on my beautiful highway. Be fixed. Get off the upgrade tool. Here we go.

1468
04:15:17,989 --> 04:15:22,469
One, two, three, four. Look at this traffic that's going to come down here.

1469
04:15:22,870 --> 04:15:33,479
Okay. Welcome to Wink Dink City. Well, it's not my fault. The fucking earthquake destroyed

1470
04:15:33,479 --> 04:16:06,920
everything. What is this? Oh shit. Is this a life? Is this a life? Okay. Is this a life?

1471
04:16:10,780 --> 04:16:19,049
Oh, it's okay. Fuck it. Just put a roundabout in here and it'll solve the whole problem.

1472
04:16:20,440 --> 04:16:37,030
Here. Oh no. Oh, no. People live here, man. People live here. Well, this is like an exit?

1473
04:16:37,670 --> 04:16:57,940
This is such a piece of shit. It's unbelievable. No, it's impossible. Is this a way? Is this a

1474
04:16:57,940 --> 04:17:08,309
runway? Oh, highway. Okay. How about we... No, fuck that. Let's just go back to what I was doing.

1475
04:17:08,309 --> 04:17:18,920
All right. We need to... commercials. We need high density commercial zone. There. Rebuild.

1476
04:17:20,040 --> 04:17:29,879
Rebuild. Commercials. Industry. Up here. Good. Not too close to the humans.

1477
04:17:30,700 --> 04:17:47,540
Don't go too close to the humans. High density, you fool. That is high density.

1478
04:17:51,750 --> 04:18:02,139
All right. Now I got to rebuild the fucking school, man. I got destroyed with that. It's

1479
04:18:02,139 --> 04:18:12,840
going to go back here. Let's take a look at this traffic pattern. This would be so confusing.

1480
04:18:16,440 --> 04:18:33,590
Fucking road in history. Oh God. Wait. They can drive straight? Holy shit. That's so bad.

1481
04:18:37,459 --> 04:18:52,309
All right. Make it a toll road. I don't even know how to do that. All right. Increase taxes. Go.

1482
04:18:52,309 --> 04:19:13,829
What's this? Oh, more trash. Build, rebuild. That's okay. It's going to get rid of all the

1483
04:19:13,829 --> 04:19:27,510
broken stuff. Any more broken stuff? Right here. Broken. Broken. Broken. Okay. Any more

1484
04:19:27,510 --> 04:19:34,629
broken stuff? All right. Now that complaining about the taxes, it's time to shut it off in three,

1485
04:19:35,430 --> 04:19:58,069
two, one. Turn it off. Okay. Cool. Let's make our university again. That'd be nice.

1486
04:20:19,000 --> 04:20:30,600
Red light here. Turn right. Red light roundabout. Okay. I think we're doing all right. We're going

1487
04:20:30,600 --> 04:20:39,399
to get some workers. We need more residential areas. So here's what I propose. Highway off down

1488
04:20:39,399 --> 04:20:45,850
here. Oh no. Okay. Check this out. Are you, are you even looking at me? Are you even paying attention

1489
04:20:45,850 --> 04:20:55,450
to me? Look at me. Are you looking? Check this out. Span down here and have this all be houses. All

1490
04:20:55,450 --> 04:21:49,370
of it. All of it. You understand? Are you fucking looking at me? Are you paying attention? There.

1491
04:21:49,370 --> 04:22:05,110
Nice. And then we're going to go right down the middle. For the bigger road. Okay. Nice.

1492
04:22:06,459 --> 04:22:27,690
That's cool. That'd be nice. High density residential. Incoming. You want to talk about

1493
04:22:27,690 --> 04:22:46,760
population? Here it comes. What's going on over here? Oops. Is that a power plant? Fuck. Is that

1494
04:22:46,760 --> 04:22:57,479
a power plant? Did I delete a power plant? Is that a power plant? Is that a power plant? Was it? Was

1495
04:22:57,479 --> 04:23:05,959
it actually? Was it a power plant? Was it actually a power plant? No, it wasn't. Okay. Good.

1496
04:23:05,959 --> 04:23:44,969
All right. We need to do, uh, our water and material, water and materia. See? Okay. Now we

1497
04:23:44,969 --> 04:23:58,219
need electricity. We need electricity. All right. Shut up. Looking good. I'm going to get a ton more

1498
04:23:58,219 --> 04:24:04,629
people here now. I need an elementary school over here right now. Elementary school. I don't have

1499
04:24:04,629 --> 04:24:23,110
enough money for that. Cool. I'm going to sneeze. Is it finally going to happen? No, stop saying it

1500
04:24:23,110 --> 04:24:30,069
and just record it. Fuck. Why? Every time I say it, I out loud and I'm about to record it.

1501
04:24:30,069 --> 04:24:44,629
I get my fucking box ready and I'm about to press a button. It's gone. Pain in the ass.

1502
04:24:44,629 --> 04:24:54,760
All right. Let's go build it. Triple the density. 13,000. No more natural disasters for a little

1503
04:24:54,760 --> 04:25:01,290
while. No more natural disasters. Give me a little while. At least a little bit. You know what I'm

1504
04:25:01,290 --> 04:25:15,399
saying? Build faster. Yeah, man. I is going to have a spliff now and take it easy. What?

1505
04:25:16,760 --> 04:25:29,379
Oh fuck. Oh yeah, that's right. It's weeds no longer legal here. Educational blimps.

1506
04:25:37,819 --> 04:25:48,780
For-profit education. Fuck that. That's too much right now. Taxation. Tax raise for low density

1507
04:25:48,780 --> 04:26:00,969
residential. Tax relief for low density residential. Let go of leisure. Leisure specialized areas.

1508
04:26:00,969 --> 04:26:11,860
Stop generating tax income. Tax raise for office. Tax relief for, all right, tax relief for

1509
04:26:12,659 --> 04:26:21,930
low density residential. And then tax raise for high density commercial.

1510
04:26:22,729 --> 04:26:33,579
And then tax relief for low density commercial. And then tax relief for offices. And then raise

1511
04:26:33,579 --> 04:26:42,760
taxes on high density residential. And then lower the taxes for low density residential.

1512
04:26:42,760 --> 04:27:03,379
That should work out pretty well. How do you not have trash? Taxes not zero. Omega low.

1513
04:27:05,430 --> 04:27:14,950
Okay. You want to see what happens if you go to zero taxes across the board? Let's see what happens.

1514
04:27:15,590 --> 04:27:38,629
Let's see. I expected five days for the earth to be on fire. What if all of a sudden it was like,

1515
04:27:38,629 --> 04:27:43,110
just like a blistering utopia. It was like perfect and I have to like eat my words.

1516
04:27:52,360 --> 04:28:03,290
No taxes. Whoa, we're at a net loss. See, this is what happens when it takes fucking three days.

1517
04:28:10,920 --> 04:28:18,010
I'm governor Elbert. So let me drag the slider to zero taxes. Wait, wait, put it back, put it back,

1518
04:28:18,010 --> 04:28:38,950
put it back. How come nothing's building here? Why is nothing building here? Because it's, it's what?

1519
04:28:38,950 --> 04:28:49,579
What's wrong? What? It's, why is the, what happened? Fuck, fuck, fuck. We need, I think it's time for

1520
04:28:49,579 --> 04:29:03,450
oil. Oil. No, coal. We're still on coal. Coal. Coal. Producing. Done. There you go. Power

1521
04:29:03,450 --> 04:29:13,829
resolved. Build these fucking houses. What are you doing? Build parks? No. Okay, fine.

1522
04:29:16,329 --> 04:29:33,719
How about a dog park? Yeah, a dog park. Yeah. And then a picnic table. Picnic. How about a picnic area?

1523
04:29:33,719 --> 04:29:54,250
How about some picnic? How about a picnic area? Fix the traffic. I will in a year. How about right

1524
04:29:54,250 --> 04:30:00,420
here? Yeah, a little like a picnic area right across from the high school. Yeah, that's good.

1525
04:30:01,219 --> 04:30:35,770
Remember the link. Quick, the link. Click the link. Whatever. Yeah, everyone has their own,

1526
04:30:35,770 --> 04:30:43,780
everyone has an opinion. Everyone's got their own opinion. That's fine. How many people are at the

1527
04:30:43,780 --> 04:30:49,459
university? Only, this doesn't make it 4,000 fucking students. Where is all the, where are

1528
04:30:49,459 --> 04:31:01,879
the students? Taxes too high on the, on industry. All right. I'll alleviate some of that. There.

1529
04:31:01,879 --> 04:31:08,379
Happy? Now what? Commercial? Too high taxes on commercial industry? All right, fine. We'll,

1530
04:31:08,379 --> 04:31:16,870
we'll do some alleviation. Okay. All right. You got me. All right. You got me. You got me.

1531
04:31:18,040 --> 04:31:21,319
I'm on crack. Like, I'm, I'm on crack today. I don't know what's going on here.

1532
04:31:23,540 --> 04:31:30,729
How hard does it work to make a working power grid? Well, excuse me. You didn't exist up until

1533
04:31:30,729 --> 04:31:48,649
like fucking 10 minutes ago. Just relax. This is temporary. I'll fix it later. You don't do crack.

1534
04:31:48,649 --> 04:31:51,209
I know that that doesn't, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying this is a crack string.

1535
04:31:51,930 --> 04:32:01,530
It's temporary. Just wait till they build up these places. How much money? Snines,

1536
04:32:01,530 --> 04:32:07,399
thousand dollars a second. Did I make a school over here? Nope. I gotta do that now.

1537
04:32:08,200 --> 04:32:14,260
I want to replace an advert on a blimp, but these educational posters. Oh, please.

1538
04:32:14,979 --> 04:32:24,600
All right. We need a elementary school. Two of them, one down here and then one up here.

1539
04:32:25,239 --> 04:32:34,549
Okay. The least they're not going to be idiots. And then I want a high school right in the middle.

1540
04:32:38,790 --> 04:32:41,989
Did you idiot? What do you mean? Why? Because no, I don't want them to be stupid.

1541
04:32:50,229 --> 04:32:56,069
Our commercials. It's our way of saying we hear you. So don't be silenced when opportunity calls.

1542
04:32:56,069 --> 04:33:06,900
Pick it up. It's for you. Accio mobile. It's too much harsh prison sentences.

1543
04:33:08,340 --> 04:33:27,720
Fire. Where I thought that was a whole citizens are sick. Oh, I only have one hospital.

1544
04:33:28,869 --> 04:33:44,310
Oh, why are they sick? That's a good question. Need more educated, not enough goods to sell

1545
04:33:44,310 --> 04:34:09,020
more industry. Make it a historical building. Does that even do? Not bad for my flaw.

1546
04:34:09,979 --> 04:34:28,340
You know, when you really zoom out, you start to understand that this is not really a town

1547
04:34:28,340 --> 04:34:39,830
as much as it is the current state of your headphone wire. You made a toilet city.

1548
04:34:40,950 --> 04:34:54,659
Oh, people are really sick over here. I need a hospital. How much? 23,000 hospitals. All right.

1549
04:34:56,259 --> 04:35:03,860
Hospital. Medical center. Medical helicopter. Sports hall. Community pool. No, I need a hospital.

1550
04:35:06,459 --> 04:35:35,500
Hospital. Need more money. Taxes. Only for a minute. Only for a few minutes. Only for a minute.

1551
04:35:35,500 --> 04:35:37,819
All right. All right. All right. All right. Everybody calm down. I'm doing it. I'm taking

1552
04:35:37,819 --> 04:35:46,380
it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. Take it off.

1553
04:35:46,380 --> 04:36:00,090
Take it back to home. Hospital. I still don't have enough money for this fucking thing.

1554
04:36:00,729 --> 04:36:09,849
How many hospitals are there? What is that? I already have hospitals. I already have hospitals.

1555
04:36:09,849 --> 04:36:30,500
What are you talking about? I already have hospitals. I already have plenty of hospitals.

1556
04:36:30,500 --> 04:36:57,020
Separated by the tunnel. So? So what? They're fine. All right. I got 71,000 dollars. It's time

1557
04:36:57,020 --> 04:37:09,319
to really go fucking nuts. How's this residential looking over here? I'm pretty good. Pretty good.

1558
04:37:09,319 --> 04:37:14,360
Pretty good. Pretty good. All right. Now we're going to do a little bit more industry up this way.

1559
04:37:15,080 --> 04:37:18,250
I want some more. I'm going to make a more wind. I'm going to make a more a wind farm.

1560
04:37:19,130 --> 04:37:45,830
Super wind farm. This is a super wind turbine and into the water. Oh, nice. Pretty cool. Are

1561
04:37:45,830 --> 04:38:08,380
these connected? They are. It's too loud. There's nothing over here. Why these houses keep getting

1562
04:38:08,380 --> 04:38:19,209
abandoned? My finger is getting sore to click on them. What's wrong here? I'm not enough custom

1563
04:38:19,209 --> 04:38:30,119
reason. What are you selling? I don't know what's in there. All right. We need more industry. We're

1564
04:38:30,119 --> 04:38:41,130
going to go out this way. More industry. Industry road. You need a super road. Six lane road from

1565
04:38:42,090 --> 04:39:21,400
here out. I'm not going to do that. Don't worry. This could be kind of cool. What could be up here?

1566
04:39:22,040 --> 04:39:49,500
Cool houses. This would be pretty cool. I kind of like this idea. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. This is very

1567
04:39:49,500 --> 04:40:00,439
yucky. Very yucky. How about... Oh, okay. Well, first of all, let's just do what I was going to do.

1568
04:40:00,439 --> 04:40:11,189
We need industry. We need industry. Produce more goods and shit. That's all that's going to happen

1569
04:40:11,189 --> 04:40:26,659
up here. This is the industry zone. And then if I go... Oh, wait a minute. I have an idea.

1570
04:40:26,659 --> 04:40:44,900
Check this out. Hey, hold on. All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1571
04:40:44,900 --> 04:41:14,630
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey. What the fuck? Too much poop water? What do you mean?

1572
04:41:15,349 --> 04:41:25,750
Who is the ambulance? That was an illegal U-turn. What are these U-turns? Illegal U-turn.

1573
04:41:26,549 --> 04:41:40,229
How much do I do with production capacity? I got plenty of capacity. Let me keep doing

1574
04:41:40,229 --> 04:41:46,409
what I was doing over here. So hear me out. Now we're going to do like a big countryside drive.

1575
04:41:47,209 --> 04:41:52,340
Oh, yeah. Look at this. It's going to be all up here. Cool. All right.

1576
04:41:53,060 --> 04:42:11,990
Look at the poop. I'm not looking at poop. Yeah. Look at this shit. And then you go down to a new

1577
04:42:11,990 --> 04:42:33,020
town. This is like a scenic drive. Perfect. I could do, uh, not industry. What should I put up here?

1578
04:42:33,909 --> 04:42:37,029
Fuck. I should have done the scenic drive. Whatever. How about a few of these?

1579
04:42:56,569 --> 04:43:14,650
You fucked that one up. I can't like pick it up and bend it. Dude, just... Oh, I got it. Small

1580
04:43:14,650 --> 04:43:22,259
business enthusiast. Cable cars, monorail. What the... What? Replace this with a monorail. Done.

1581
04:43:22,259 --> 04:43:26,580
Replace it with... What else did I get? A train station. Ooh. Okay. I'm going to make a monorail.

1582
04:43:29,990 --> 04:43:37,779
Yoga garden. All right. Monorail time. I know you want water. I know, I know, I know, I know,

1583
04:43:37,779 --> 04:43:54,569
I know, I know, I know, I know. There's too many things. Just wait. Just don't fucking move. Good.

1584
04:43:54,569 --> 04:44:03,959
Shit. Okay. Hold on. Nobody move. Not enough fuel for the coal power plant. Not enough fuel.

1585
04:44:04,840 --> 04:44:14,490
Where do you get... Where do you get coal? Where do you get coal? Where are you supposed to get it?

1586
04:44:14,490 --> 04:44:32,470
Are you supposed to put... Wait. Oh, use coal to produce electricity. So what's the problem?

1587
04:44:32,470 --> 04:44:50,380
I need to show resources? Are you kidding me? The map has natural resource ability that can be

1588
04:44:50,380 --> 04:44:59,990
utilized by a law and industry specialized in forestry, oil, ore, or agriculture. Oh, fuck you.

1589
04:44:59,990 --> 04:45:12,540
Okay. Oh, up here. There's coal in there. Why is my city full of... What are you talking about?

1590
04:45:14,650 --> 04:45:29,189
Somebody died in here? A dead person is waiting in here. Wait, where's the cemetery? Let's go.

1591
04:45:29,189 --> 04:45:39,479
Where is the cemetery? Wait, is the guy... Is the guy that runs the cemetery getting arrested?

1592
04:45:45,909 --> 04:45:59,110
Volunteer at the sem... Where the fuck are you? It's too far away. All right. I'm putting the

1593
04:45:59,110 --> 04:46:25,459
cemetery over... Garbage is piled up in this... Ah! Garbage production. Oh, shit. Garbage

1594
04:46:25,459 --> 04:46:35,049
processing. I need more trash over... They're not going to be happy about this, but I have to

1595
04:46:35,049 --> 04:47:09,029
put it here. Here, please check the water pumps. What? Oh, how do I... How do I clean this? Eco

1596
04:47:09,029 --> 04:47:24,069
water outlet? Fresh water outlet. The green alternative, while the eco-wire is quite

1597
04:47:24,069 --> 04:47:33,319
expensive, it helps purify the water and let it... Will the water let out of it? How do I get rid of

1598
04:47:33,319 --> 04:47:47,979
this? Get the water near the intake. Shit. It's sucking up the poop water. I have to move these.

1599
04:47:48,860 --> 04:48:01,450
It's starting to suck up the shit water. Oh, no. These have to move up. People are turning

1600
04:48:01,450 --> 04:48:08,180
their showers on and being rained with diarrhea. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. Pause it. Don't worry.

1601
04:48:08,180 --> 04:48:42,180
Everybody relax. The mayor is on the case. Okay. We're good. Hey, I smell regular pipes.

1602
04:48:50,020 --> 04:49:01,240
Water in sewage heated... Where are the pipes? Am I stupid? What's going on? These are like heated

1603
04:49:01,240 --> 04:49:26,630
pipes. It's not the same thing. This is like a different thing. All right. Delete this shit.

1604
04:49:27,349 --> 04:49:40,939
I said, delete it. Delete it. All right. We're good. So now, was like the shit...

1605
04:49:43,099 --> 04:49:53,430
Okay. We're good. Back to normal. People are dying. A dead person is waiting for transport.

1606
04:49:54,069 --> 04:50:00,020
I need another cemetery. Okay. We're doing a cemetery over... I don't... I need one right

1607
04:50:00,020 --> 04:50:09,799
over here. I have to have one. Where are they? This is a medical cemetery. A medical... What

1608
04:50:09,799 --> 04:50:23,139
about this crematorium thing? Hospital. Cemetery. Medical clinic. Sauna. I don't have enough for it.

1609
04:50:23,700 --> 04:50:29,770
Whatever. All right. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. I'm going to build a road right here. I'm just

1610
04:50:29,770 --> 04:50:34,409
going to build a road right here. Get off the highway and go to the fucking cemetery.

1611
04:50:42,580 --> 04:50:45,299
Fix the roads. You think I can fix this shit? It's over.

1612
04:50:47,509 --> 04:50:50,869
Traffic. I will in a second. All right. No, no, no. Right here. It needs to be like over here.

1613
04:50:52,540 --> 04:50:58,680
I think they're going to be pissed off that it's over here, but I have to put it over here.

1614
04:50:58,680 --> 04:51:03,159
I'm going to make another... Okay. Here we go. Make a little road. It comes out this way.

1615
04:51:04,040 --> 04:51:27,099
It's just a small one. It's great. I don't want a curved road. Okay. Cemetery. Right here.

1616
04:51:27,819 --> 04:51:34,409
There's only those people over here though. What the fuck?

1617
04:51:34,810 --> 04:51:57,799
Oh, finally we can bury our dead. Hooray. I got 75k. Trash is building up. All right. I need

1618
04:51:57,799 --> 04:52:05,590
another dump. How's the dump looking? How many dumps do I got? Go to traffic. All right. Fine.

1619
04:52:06,150 --> 04:52:17,689
Oh shit. My chest.

1620
04:52:29,340 --> 04:52:38,779
Where are you people going? These tiny roads. This would be scary to drive down. Especially

1621
04:52:38,779 --> 04:52:45,799
considering people can park on the street. People can park on the streets. I got to fix this.

1622
04:52:48,790 --> 04:52:55,610
Large roads. We need six lane roads here. Oh, it's going to destroy this.

1623
04:53:01,930 --> 04:53:11,290
Does it only shift the bottleneck? Well, what would you have me do? Leave it like this? What's

1624
04:53:11,290 --> 04:53:25,029
the alternative? Set it to upgrade. It destroys them. It's going to take out the whole industry

1625
04:53:25,029 --> 04:53:57,740
area. I have to do it. Okay. Wait, what? Oh my God. I have to mess. All right. That should be okay.

1626
04:54:12,659 --> 04:54:23,400
All right. Incoming economic collapse. I'm fine right now. I know you don't look. I'm going to

1627
04:54:23,400 --> 04:54:28,580
switch. When we get into residential, we switch over. This is better. All right. Better. That

1628
04:54:28,580 --> 04:54:36,759
should alleviate some of the tension. Just don't delete the university. Where is it? Over there.

1629
04:54:39,689 --> 04:54:55,880
Okay. Here we go. They will return. Businesses will come back. That's fine. Relax.

1630
04:55:33,819 --> 04:55:54,459
How do you need water? Oh, water consumption. What are you talking about?

1631
04:55:55,419 --> 04:56:15,669
You're fine. Can somebody go pick up this dead person? I need another cemetery. Just put it

1632
04:56:15,669 --> 04:56:36,419
next door. Seriously, I need it here. Look at how much this will address the problem. Connect the

1633
04:56:36,419 --> 04:56:49,180
road? I don't understand. You don't connect this road? What do you mean connect the road?

1634
04:57:02,220 --> 04:57:07,740
Wait, I have to make this smaller for one second. Why can't I make this bigger?

1635
04:57:17,430 --> 04:57:30,819
Oh, shit. I don't understand traffic. I don't understand. Okay. Make this larger. I can't make

1636
04:57:30,819 --> 04:57:38,090
it. Why can't I make this one bigger? I can't even make it a double. I can't even make it a double.

1637
04:57:47,819 --> 04:58:04,139
The ambulance is Austin powers. Where's the fire? We need to make one of the emergency vehicles.

1638
04:58:06,580 --> 04:58:17,299
Sitting in traffic. Two, three, four ambulances. They're going crazy. Where's the hospital?

1639
04:58:20,009 --> 04:58:31,979
Where are they trying to go? I don't know where they're going. I need to relax. Relax. Okay,

1640
04:58:31,979 --> 04:58:54,580
the road's bigger now. You can fucking move. Ow. Just make the whole thing. Six lanes of

1641
04:58:54,580 --> 04:58:59,860
Aden. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. Okay, there. You can drive.

1642
04:59:07,209 --> 04:59:27,029
Make it space. This doesn't even work, man. There's so many ambulances.

1643
04:59:30,259 --> 04:59:34,819
But I don't know. Okay. I don't understand why there's so many ambulances driving by.

1644
04:59:36,180 --> 04:59:48,389
There's nothing even happening. It's fine. It's because of the car accident. It's because the

1645
04:59:48,389 --> 05:00:01,299
car accident. Why are they not using both lanes? Why are they not using it? Why are they only using

1646
05:00:01,299 --> 05:00:07,220
it? Because this one asshole is parked in the street. That guy was parked. That guy was parked

1647
05:00:07,220 --> 05:00:23,750
in the middle of the street. You see that bullshit? Why the fuck did you do that? Oh my God. I don't

1648
05:00:23,750 --> 05:00:28,700
know anything about fucking city design. I don't know anything. I don't know anything about this

1649
05:00:28,700 --> 05:00:34,740
shit. Tell me where somebody's fucking seeing this that like does this shit for a living and

1650
05:00:34,740 --> 05:00:39,299
they're like, holy shit, how did this guy get out of fourth grade? I don't know. Very, very carefully,

1651
05:00:39,299 --> 05:00:56,069
apparently. Okay, so what's happening here? Why are they only using one lane? Why are they all in

1652
05:00:57,189 --> 05:01:02,869
one lane? I don't understand. Are you all taking a right hand turn?

1653
05:01:03,349 --> 05:01:22,779
They're all taking a right. Oh my God. It's chaos. Okay. Just make the roads bigger. There. See.

1654
05:01:23,819 --> 05:01:33,799
I don't know. Just do it. Just do it to every road that I can do it to. All roads need to be

1655
05:01:34,360 --> 05:01:55,930
there. Okay. My fucking throat hurts. Jesus Christ.

1656
05:02:19,380 --> 05:02:26,580
Where's the fire department? Where's the fire department? Fire department. We need one

1657
05:02:26,580 --> 05:02:33,880
right now. We need a fire station. Fire station, please. Fire station over here.

1658
05:02:33,880 --> 05:02:43,430
Fire station over here. Put it out. How many fire? I need another fire station. We need another one

1659
05:02:43,430 --> 05:02:48,900
right here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. You don't have to do. Get out there. Go on. Get out

1660
05:02:48,900 --> 05:02:53,060
there. Get out there. Get out there. All the traffic. It's okay. Why are you going this way?

1661
05:02:56,419 --> 05:03:07,000
Holy shit. Every fire department. Every single fucking county. Oh my God.

1662
05:03:13,209 --> 05:03:20,889
Why are you turning around? Stop here and put this out. Put it out. Where are the rest of them?

1663
05:03:23,639 --> 05:03:28,729
Holy shit. Okay. We're fine. We're fine. It's just, we just,

1664
05:03:37,720 --> 05:03:52,619
can we please just stop this and just clean this up? Where are they going?

1665
05:03:53,259 --> 05:03:58,259
There's not another fire over here, right? There are no fires down here, are there?

1666
05:03:58,819 --> 05:04:18,340
Oh my God. Wait. Why are there fires everywhere? I don't understand. What happened? What the fuck

1667
05:04:18,340 --> 05:04:23,930
is going on? Did I get hit by a meteor? I don't know. I don't know why this is happening. Is there

1668
05:04:23,930 --> 05:04:42,459
fire? This is still spreading. Guys, I need more fire. I need more fire.

1669
05:04:43,259 --> 05:05:07,419
Um, just built it in. It's going to be okay. It's going to be, it's going to be, we have plenty of,

1670
05:05:07,419 --> 05:05:16,439
we have plenty of units at this point. How many operator fire engines in use? Zero. Zero out of

1671
05:05:16,439 --> 05:05:26,740
23. Zero, huh? Zero? Get out there. Where are all the garbage trucks? I don't know. We're having

1672
05:05:26,740 --> 05:05:38,580
like a total city wide, like burning of our whole town for some fucking reason. What happened here?

1673
05:05:40,740 --> 05:06:00,700
Jesus. Okay. I think we're, are we, are we, are we done? Are we good? Oh Jesus, man. I have to,

1674
05:06:00,700 --> 05:06:13,540
did you see the blimp? Oh, my fucking head hurts. That was fucking outrageous. The traffic,

1675
05:06:13,540 --> 05:06:23,930
they couldn't even get through the trap. No, this is on fire. Guys, just how do I,

1676
05:06:24,569 --> 05:06:29,580
I can't delete this with my hand. 30, I only have $30,000. What happened?

1677
05:06:36,409 --> 05:06:44,069
This is going to spread over here. Okay. Well, that was interesting.

1678
05:06:44,790 --> 05:07:10,680
Oh, hold on. Oh, I'm like choking. All right. I need to clean this up and do what I was doing

1679
05:07:10,680 --> 05:07:17,560
before. Whatever that was. I don't even remember. I was going to build a monorail over here. Right.

1680
05:07:18,790 --> 05:07:43,560
Yeah. That's what I was doing. Okay. Monorail time. Wait, bus. Where's the monorail? Metro.

1681
05:07:44,360 --> 05:08:03,159
Train. Ship. Plane. Monorail. Monorail station. Monorail station with road. Ooh. Monorail bus hub.

1682
05:08:03,159 --> 05:08:07,479
A monorail station with a built-in bus stop so passengers could easily switch between the two

1683
05:08:07,479 --> 05:08:24,389
transport. All right, here we go. Wait, it has to be on a building? Wait, it has to be on a road?

1684
05:09:15,939 --> 05:09:24,810
Let's keep going. You have no money? I'll just raise taxes for five minutes. Okay. I need to

1685
05:09:24,810 --> 05:09:37,430
continue my monorail. First, I need... Where was the monorail? Who the hell was that? I don't

1686
05:09:37,430 --> 05:10:16,409
know what that was. Oh, here. Okay. Monorail. Where am I going? I don't know. I want to just

1687
05:10:16,409 --> 05:10:21,799
have a monorail go around the whole town and have those stops along the way. Can I do that?

1688
05:10:27,380 --> 05:10:32,259
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen. Okay. I wanted to come down here and then

1689
05:10:32,340 --> 05:10:41,380
have the... Yeah, right here. Okay, good. And then we have them get out. Monorail station.

1690
05:10:41,939 --> 05:10:52,759
How do you make them get out? Monorail line. Click on monorail stops connected with tracks to each

1691
05:10:52,759 --> 05:11:11,259
other. Wait, monorail stops? How do I make it so we can get out? No, I'm not ready to do this yet.

1692
05:11:11,900 --> 05:11:47,049
Do I have to build a road? But I actually need a fucking road? Okay. When you go down, you get to

1693
05:11:47,049 --> 05:11:53,930
go like, whoa. And it's like a landmark. Stop. What? This is the dumbest city plan. Who voted

1694
05:11:53,930 --> 05:12:27,029
for this? Okay. So now have them get out. Okay. Right here. So now get out of this. How do I

1695
05:12:27,029 --> 05:13:07,099
connect this? Teach him. Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop. It's connected. What the fuck? Here we go.

1696
05:13:07,659 --> 05:13:32,009
Done. All right. I know I need electricity. I'm not dumb. I'm not dumb. See? I'm not dumb.

1697
05:13:32,009 --> 05:13:43,209
We're already connected here, right? Yeah. All right. Now we need to connect.

1698
05:13:44,979 --> 05:14:00,330
Ooh. Oof. Oof. This is right here. And then I'll make it in the cup. This is not ready to be used

1699
05:14:00,330 --> 05:14:21,240
yet. So don't worry. Okay. This way. Here comes the residential. Put it up this way. Over here.

1700
05:14:22,119 --> 05:14:44,599
Then you go over here. Okay. Good. Okay. This is like trees and shit. Okay. I'm gonna need water.

1701
05:14:45,959 --> 05:15:05,669
I'm gonna have to do some more pumping, which is fine. Electric. Don't have to be there yet.

1702
05:15:07,130 --> 05:15:14,439
Oh, I can connect it from here. Look at that. It'll work out pretty well. What's wrong? Oh,

1703
05:15:14,439 --> 05:15:23,020
I need electricity. How much do I have? I have plenty. What's going on? How do you have no,

1704
05:15:23,020 --> 05:15:36,169
how do you know, how do you have no electricity? Electricity production 252. What's going on?

1705
05:15:40,659 --> 05:15:47,290
Why is there a total power outage over here? I'm, I'm have way more production. How,

1706
05:15:47,290 --> 05:16:04,340
why they disconnected? I got plenty of electricity available. What's wrong?

1707
05:16:09,659 --> 05:16:15,349
Poop is clogging the wires. What am I missing here? Why would they be disconnected if I have

1708
05:16:15,349 --> 05:16:29,669
plenty of electricity to use? Oh, was it a bad connection? What happened? Oh, this is fucked up

1709
05:16:29,669 --> 05:16:46,419
right here. Oh, this is fucked up. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. It's fucked up. What is this even

1710
05:16:46,419 --> 05:17:03,029
connected to? Okay. So that is powering this whole entire spot. And now, but can I not, I fucked it

1711
05:17:03,029 --> 05:17:19,000
up. Did I, I did. Can I not go from here to here? Not connected to the turbines. Your wire to your

1712
05:17:19,000 --> 05:17:46,360
water wind farm. Thank you. That's connecting, right? Yeah, we're good. Should be. Yeah. Look

1713
05:17:46,360 --> 05:17:56,279
at that light up. How do you not have water? Do a production. Oh, water. Okay. We need more.

1714
05:17:56,279 --> 05:18:04,819
We need a little pump. Okay. I'm going to do the green ones. Pump, water pumping station.

1715
05:18:05,459 --> 05:18:19,700
Get it over here. Right. Okay. Good. Pump it up. Nice. Sick. Cool. And then we need a dumping

1716
05:18:19,700 --> 05:18:36,979
station. But this time I'm going to do the eco one. Eco water outlet. Cool. Look. Eco. There we go.

1717
05:18:38,860 --> 05:18:52,540
Please check the noise. Noise. Pollution. Everywhere. Fire safety.

1718
05:18:52,779 --> 05:19:03,319
Move. Prime. Everything's good. Look, crime. Noise pollution. That's very loud.

1719
05:19:03,959 --> 05:19:07,080
Oh, I don't like looking at this. I don't want to, I don't look at that anymore.

1720
05:19:08,860 --> 05:19:17,590
All right. Let's do, uh, let's get this connected. This is temporary. Temporary. Remember,

1721
05:19:24,220 --> 05:19:34,169
they have water. What else is wrong? Not enough educated workers. What happened to the college?

1722
05:19:36,419 --> 05:19:41,299
Why are there only 394 students out of 4,000 that are capable to go here?

1723
05:19:42,099 --> 05:20:04,220
What the hell's going on here? Public library. No, I want like a trade school.

1724
05:20:05,020 --> 05:20:10,340
There are three types of campus areas in your city can include only one of each type.

1725
05:20:13,220 --> 05:20:32,970
A trade school is just a path. Click the link. Ah, sure. They called me a madman.

1726
05:20:35,720 --> 05:20:44,389
All right. Speaking of that, let's get back to the fun stuff. New music station. Something else.

1727
05:20:45,189 --> 05:20:51,509
Okay. I need to connect this road and then this is open for business. What happened here?

1728
05:20:52,150 --> 05:21:06,150
Citizens are sick. A dead person's in here. Citizens are sick. I have like five of these things.

1729
05:21:10,009 --> 05:21:33,299
Isolated. Oh, they're not sick anymore. Why are these all abandoned? Why are these all abandoned?

1730
05:21:34,180 --> 05:21:40,380
Excuse me. What's going on here? Oh, there weren't enough people to work the job. Oh,

1731
05:21:42,409 --> 05:21:47,619
this whole street is going to get abandoned. All right. Well, now there's plenty more options.

1732
05:21:47,619 --> 05:22:02,979
Okay. Connect this road here so we can use the monorail. Here we go. Nice. Yeah, I'll fix it.

1733
05:22:02,979 --> 05:22:13,400
Don't worry. I did tell you that was temporary. I did say that. Yes, I did. You did not. Yes,

1734
05:22:13,400 --> 05:22:38,889
I did. Stop. All right. So who's going to use it? Can I adjust the speed? These are all houses.

1735
05:22:38,889 --> 05:22:42,970
Holy shit. There's a lot of people over here. All right. I need elementary school.

1736
05:22:42,970 --> 05:23:06,790
I don't have any money. Okay. Good. And then a high school. And then, you know, let's put a library

1737
05:23:06,790 --> 05:23:11,450
over here. A better library. You know, I only have one in the whole town, but we'll be a library

1738
05:23:11,450 --> 05:23:15,849
right here for all the people to come and hang out. Good. All right. Now let's increase the

1739
05:23:15,849 --> 05:23:29,619
fuck out of taxes and make it... Wait, somebody going to get on the monorail? This road doesn't

1740
05:23:29,619 --> 05:23:36,090
go anywhere. I need more people. I need more jobs. All right. Let's do some more residential.

1741
05:23:36,810 --> 05:23:53,779
It's already there. Good. I don't think anyone's going to get on this. Go on first person with

1742
05:23:53,779 --> 05:24:24,459
the monorail. How do I do that? Whoa, cool. You can click on the train now. Wait, somebody's using

1743
05:24:24,459 --> 05:24:38,330
this road. It's an ambulance. Where are you off to? Where are you going? There's no hospitals down

1744
05:24:38,330 --> 05:24:59,959
here. Good maneuvering. You went over the fun hump. Oh, hold on. Oh, somebody's sick in here.

1745
05:25:01,830 --> 05:25:09,669
Okay. Let's go. Get him. Get him into the back of the ambulance. Take him to the hospital. Quickly.

1746
05:25:23,500 --> 05:26:22,470
Stopping at a red light? Siren's not even on. There's another red light. What? Where is he?

1747
05:26:32,220 --> 05:26:57,720
Wait, what? What's this monorail doing over here? Oh, right. I forgot. This is too far to go.

1748
05:26:57,720 --> 05:27:26,040
I need to make some medical centers down there. It's been like 12 days. It's a road trip. How

1749
05:27:26,040 --> 05:27:39,189
come nobody's using the monorail? I want to see somebody in it. It's, you guys, a frost country

1750
05:27:39,189 --> 05:27:49,720
emergency. Yep. At least there's no traffic here. Oh, wait. Somebody going to get on the monorail?

1751
05:27:49,720 --> 05:28:25,000
Oh, fuck this. I don't care about that anymore. Yeah. Drive the guy through the smog with the

1752
05:28:25,000 --> 05:28:46,409
windows down. Why are you going on this road? Shit. You're going to let this guy... What the

1753
05:28:46,409 --> 05:29:13,959
fuck? He's right there. Why is it so loud? This window keeps moving. Dude, I can't follow it. The

1754
05:29:13,959 --> 05:29:23,900
window keeps fucking moving. I never thought about how much garbage piles up in two weeks.

1755
05:29:23,900 --> 05:30:09,209
Where's the nearest hospital? Hey. Oh, okay. We made it. Did he make it? I think he made it.

1756
05:30:09,209 --> 05:30:18,569
Any more trash pick up? Okay. What happened down here? What the fuck? I'm getting so turned

1757
05:30:18,569 --> 05:30:26,090
around. The city is so fucked up. Which way is the right way? Okay. This way, right? Okay.

1758
05:30:28,709 --> 05:30:40,840
Oh, man. It hurts to look at. Okay. All right. So, fuck. Let's... There's the fire over here.

1759
05:30:42,200 --> 05:30:47,560
We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. This doesn't need to exist. People are just going

1760
05:30:47,560 --> 05:31:01,220
down here. Okay. What do I do? What do I need? I need industry, but I need workers. I need trash

1761
05:31:01,220 --> 05:31:17,590
pick up. Fix the train? What's wrong with the train? There's nothing wrong with it. How do I

1762
05:31:17,590 --> 05:31:38,459
turn it on? It needs a route? This is not a route? It needs a route. How is this not a route? I have

1763
05:31:38,459 --> 05:31:53,110
to set up a route. Oh, okay. Routes. How do I make one? How do you make a route? Traffic routes.

1764
05:31:53,909 --> 05:32:09,619
Adjust roads. Routes. It has to loop? The monorail tab. Post service. Tours. Taxi monorail.

1765
05:32:15,099 --> 05:32:36,619
Routes. Where? Routes. Where are the routes? Wait. Hold on. You're talking about...

1766
05:32:39,270 --> 05:32:56,220
It has to do this, is what you're saying? No. So, why won't it work? Top left traffic menu.

1767
05:32:56,779 --> 05:33:09,669
Have I never been to a city? Yeah, but I mean, how do I get it to... Where's the add stops

1768
05:33:09,669 --> 05:33:27,639
to both stations? Metro train hub. Monorail station with road. Monorail station. It needs

1769
05:33:27,639 --> 05:33:34,060
to be connected to other stations of the monorail track. Traffic highway. The third icon.

1770
05:33:34,939 --> 05:33:47,779
Miscellaneous. Click on the monorail stops connected with... Create a new line. There.

1771
05:33:47,779 --> 05:34:06,340
Complete the line. This is a huge PogChamp moment right here. All right. There it goes.

1772
05:34:07,060 --> 05:34:20,220
This thing's fucking fast. This thing goes faster than the cars. Okay, I've never seen a monorail

1773
05:34:20,220 --> 05:34:58,569
before that goes more than 60. Whoa. Oh, cool. Now, what do people do when they get off? Let's see.

1774
05:35:00,389 --> 05:35:12,619
Okay, responding to a call at the broad residence. I'm in a big city. Okay, responding

1775
05:35:12,619 --> 05:35:21,930
to a call at the pleasant residence. I don't... I'm a big city. Nice. This is pretty cool. I'm a

1776
05:35:21,930 --> 05:35:37,060
big city now. How much money? I got $211,000. Fucking $211,000. I need more electricity.

1777
05:35:37,060 --> 05:35:44,099
Need more wind farms. Water wind farms. What's this thing? Hydro pump. Flowing water is an

1778
05:35:44,099 --> 05:35:52,200
infinite source of kinetic power. Find a strong current in a river. Wait, what? This is not strong.

1779
05:35:52,200 --> 05:36:48,619
What's this? Water treatment plant. Get this shit on here. Water treatment plant. Done. I'm not

1780
05:36:48,619 --> 05:37:06,419
gonna take out a fucking loan. Wait, I didn't connect it. Hold on. Done. Bingo. I need more

1781
05:37:06,419 --> 05:37:28,919
power. Shit. Right. I need more of these. Okay, we're gonna see those disappear in a minute here.

1782
05:37:28,919 --> 05:37:38,939
That is 281 production. Okay, let's raise taxes like crazy for a minute and then build... build

1783
05:37:38,939 --> 05:38:10,919
a nice Statue of Liberty roundabout. What's the biggest roundabout I can make? I need a little

1784
05:38:10,919 --> 05:38:23,130
road in here. Just small enough to put it on. Like right... right there. Can I do it right there?

1785
05:38:23,849 --> 05:38:55,750
I can't put it right there? Oh yes, I can. Don't tell me what I can't. I can't fucking do a game.

1786
05:38:56,389 --> 05:39:26,650
Where's one way? Where's one way? Four lane. It's the red layer. Yeah, because it's all... it's just

1787
05:39:26,650 --> 05:40:09,340
going around. Where's... where's one way? Two lane, one way road. There we go. Make a lull of road.

1788
05:40:13,180 --> 05:40:28,549
All right, it's time to raise taxes for like fucking two minutes. Give me money now. Go,

1789
05:40:28,549 --> 05:40:32,549
go, go, go. Deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit,

1790
05:40:32,549 --> 05:41:03,240
deposit, deposit, deposit. Two, three, four. Okay, I can fix it. Need a bit... need a bigger road.

1791
05:41:03,799 --> 05:41:52,919
Need a little bit bigger. Rob... wait, it's a highway. Highway. Highway was... wait. Come on.

1792
05:41:52,919 --> 05:42:59,830
I can't put it on a highway. Here we go. One way. Six lane, one way road. Come on. I don't want

1793
05:42:59,830 --> 05:44:19,930
six lane. Fine. Build the statue first. I can't. It's gonna be on a road. Oh, why? And go. Wait,

1794
05:44:19,930 --> 05:44:25,209
why would you come through here when you can already drive by it for free? I was gonna make

1795
05:44:25,209 --> 05:44:55,979
tolls here. How do you make a toll road? Pause it, pause it, pause it. I'm so fucking stupid.

1796
05:44:55,979 --> 05:45:21,419
Right click and switch the type. Okay, so right click, road tolls. Here we go. One

1797
05:45:21,419 --> 05:46:01,659
lar... one way large toll booth. Can I move this? Okay, here we go. Over here. Over here. Here we go.

1798
05:46:01,659 --> 05:46:09,220
Why is it this way? Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. That's fine. So you come in and you go.

1799
05:46:12,599 --> 05:46:25,590
But how do you get out? Do another one, do another one. Do like three. How do I spin it around?

1800
05:46:26,569 --> 05:46:34,020
It seems to go to three tolls. Wait, what? I'm so confused. Which way are the cars driving?

1801
05:46:36,630 --> 05:46:59,720
Okay, this way. Okay, so, so you have to go. Wait, I don't have any money. Okay, explain this to me

1802
05:46:59,720 --> 05:47:11,380
because I'm fucking stupid apparently. Well, I don't understand. Which, this arrow is pointing

1803
05:47:11,380 --> 05:47:23,259
this way and arrow is pointing this way. Which way do the cars have to go? It goes both ways?

1804
05:47:23,259 --> 05:47:50,409
Look at the ends. So it goes this way. Okay, good. So it goes this way. But this is the exit.

1805
05:47:50,409 --> 05:48:28,470
So it goes this way. So I have to... I don't have any money. How the fuck do I not have any money?

1806
05:48:28,470 --> 05:49:00,330
What? Wait. Okay, I fucked it up. Move, move this fucking thing. Move it. Just move,

1807
05:49:00,330 --> 05:49:09,430
move, move, move, move, move. Pause again. Relocate this. Get rid of this. Can I tilt this?

1808
05:49:12,779 --> 05:49:21,110
How do I rearrange this? How do I rotate? How do I rotate? I can't rotate. Which button is it?

1809
05:49:21,110 --> 05:50:48,619
Okay, good. All right, good. I have fucking money. How? All right, good to go. Okay, wait,

1810
05:50:48,619 --> 05:51:12,310
wait, wait. It needs to be connected. I need power. Pause it. Okay, power and water. Done.

1811
05:51:12,310 --> 05:51:24,169
Matthew, liberty needs power. Wait, how much electricity does this use? All right, what's

1812
05:51:24,810 --> 05:51:32,060
wrong with this? Multiple problems. No road access. Make sure cars and pedestrians can reach the

1813
05:51:32,060 --> 05:51:46,490
entrance. No water's going through here. Oh, is this to be connected? All right, come on in to see

1814
05:51:46,490 --> 05:52:52,810
the Statue of Liberty. Statue's not on a road? What does that matter? How do I do that? Can I

1815
05:52:52,810 --> 05:53:20,020
pick it up? Wait, what? How did I put it down the first time? Why the fuck is the city on fire?

1816
05:53:24,729 --> 05:54:13,909
The city's burning. Wait, why? It's because this shit's a highway? I'll fix it. You motherfucker.

1817
05:54:23,110 --> 05:55:16,330
Oh, just do it already. You piece of shit. I swear to God. Connect a road to it. I can't.

1818
05:55:21,020 --> 05:55:39,830
I can't. It's like... All right, there we go. There we go. There we go. There we go.

1819
05:55:39,830 --> 05:56:04,139
Now upgrade the road. No, I can't. My taxes. Make entrance cheap. Entrance, 10 cents. Exit is fucking

1820
05:56:04,139 --> 05:56:21,020

Okay. Yeah, sure. How dare you go see the fucking Statue of Liberty. Does that work? No, I don't. I don't have any more money. I need, uh, how much money? How much fucking money does this cost? $12,000. This is 35 grand. Um, what? Alright, hold on. I need to make some money first. Wait, they're avoiding the toll. They're driving off the road. Two bucks. Thank you for an amazing vacation. See you next year. See you next year. See you next year. See you next year. See you next year. See you next year.

1831
06:02:20,529 --> 06:03:30,930
Wait, I'm not even getting fucking money for this. I don't even get any money for this one. Why not just delete this? I think these people are stuck here. Raise the price of the entrance. This is fucking diabolical. Make tolls going into the city. Speaking of the city, it's in shambles. These are all abandoned buildings. Why do I hear a fire sound? Alright, let's increase some fucking, let's go to the budget. Where's the trash? More money to the trash.

1832
06:03:30,930 --> 06:05:04,430
More, as much as possible. Taxes? Eh. Lawns? Eh. Okay, I need another toll. Uh, right about here. Let's pause it. One-way toll booth. This one's cheaper. Wait, hold on. Everyone's fucked now. I'm gonna take them all around this whole thing and then connect them. Today they have to pay it. Imagine avoiding this. Uh, oh yeah, I'm getting directions to, um, my grandmother's house. Would you like to avoid the toll road?

1833
06:05:04,430 --> 06:05:45,069
Uh, fuck it, I don't care. I guess I'll pay it. Are you sure? Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna make so much money, you have no idea. I'm gonna make hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I'll be, the next city will be so cool. This is gonna go fucking this way around here, this way down, then back down.

1834
06:05:45,069 --> 06:07:15,650
Make it go into the city? Make it go, like, through fucking residential areas? Okay, hold on. Yeah, that's funny. That's funny, I don't wanna do that. You get a whole tour of the whole city. Fuck, I'm out of money. Why are they disappearing? Hey. Hey! What's going on? It's not, it's, yeah, it is connected. It's connected. Hey! They despawned, there's no way to the destination. Ah, okay, I see. Well, they'll get there eventually. Can I take out, like, a monster lawn?

1835
06:07:15,650 --> 06:08:11,720
Listen to me. What's the cheapest road I can possibly make? Two-lane gravel road? Can I do one-way gravel road? How much is this? $20? Okay, good. One-way toll booth. Is that gravel road? There it is. Imagine driving by. Is this that you live in and you see people needing to do this? This is, this is great.

1836
06:08:11,720 --> 06:09:35,540
Okay, I need money. Money. Money. Taxes. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Taxes. Increase. Something stupid and then just immediately take it off. Nope. Stop! See? I'm, I'm good. Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright. Wait. What if I just connect this? No, they'll be stuck forever. Hold on a second. If I just connect this here, they'll just have to go in this loop literally forever. But the issue there is, when there's too much traffic, it'll get stuck.

1837
06:09:41,189 --> 06:09:49,529
The plan is to go around here. The plan is to go here and then around here back connecting to the highway.

1838
06:09:49,529 --> 06:10:23,259
Okay, I've got $67,000. You know what I'm saying? Just, like, go all the way over here. I can fix this later. Okay. Make the toll go through here.

1839
06:10:23,259 --> 06:11:05,959
Oh, shit. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Make a ramp. What is it? Page up? Okay, now we're gonna, yeah, make a, just a single road. We have to go ramp up. Okay. Ramp it down. Oh, wait. We have to go underground.

1840
06:11:05,959 --> 06:11:25,459
Okay. No, this is, that's too much. That's too much. Okay, now back to normal. We'll get a toll at the end of that, but I wanted to make sure this is connecting.

1841
06:11:25,459 --> 06:12:10,720
Wait, hold on. I gotta level this out. Taller coaster. Page up. I need to, what the fuck? Where is this, wait, wait, hold on. I need to, yeah.

1842
06:12:10,720 --> 06:12:39,520
I have to, holy shit, this is gonna take fucking forever. All right. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Back to normal. All right. Again. So we need one here.

1843
06:12:39,520 --> 06:13:09,369
We delete this. Just delete enough space where I can put it in. It's two spaces, right? Okay. Delete. I should put houses here too. And then delete this.

1844
06:13:09,369 --> 06:13:46,639
Fuck. I wish you could just do one. Do two. Okay. Delete two. How much money do I have? Not enough. Hopefully this will fix the traffic in the city.

1845
06:13:46,639 --> 06:14:06,240
How much is that fucking money? I have to finish the road. I have to for now. We'll, I'll fix it later. What am I getting? I'm $55,000 a week. Is it, are the taxes still high? No, they're not.

1846
06:14:06,240 --> 06:14:32,040
All right. I gotta connect the exit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Just connect it. I'll fix the rest later. Done. Okay. Action. I'll fix it later. I need, okay. I need power.

1847
06:14:37,439 --> 06:15:22,450
Power and water. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well, at least it'll be here already. I don't have enough money to do this. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. No, I need one of these to be over here. What is this mess right here? What the hell is this?

1848
06:15:22,450 --> 06:16:03,220
Fucking money. Come on. Come on. Negative $217. Oh, what's going on? What's going on? Oh, this shit's not connected to anything. Right. That's why it was there. Okay. Just put it from here to here. I have negative fucking money.

1849
06:16:03,220 --> 06:17:28,229
Shit. Oh fuck. Taxes. Uh oh. Uh oh. That's enough. Okay. Power. Power. Power. We need power from, we need power here. That'll do it. That'll do it. I know that's fucking stupid. I know. But just trust me on this. Wait. Tolls. As much as I can do. This is two bucks per car, by the way.

1850
06:17:28,229 --> 06:18:39,409
Hey, dude. I'll just make taxes in the city zero. Make the city taxes absolute zero. Yeah. That sounds good. Okay. There we go. Enjoy the Statue of Liberty. Is this working now? Is this connected? Wait. Hold on. Is this not connected? Is that connecting people? Should be. Alright. Looks good. Very good. Plus $57,000 coming in. Everything's alright. Let's take a look at how this looks. Good. I'm going to let this play out for a little bit. I need to fix some stuff in the city. There's so much trash.

1851
06:18:40,409 --> 06:20:16,810
Oh fuck. Who cares? Fuck these people. Put a dump right here. They're going to get mad that they're driving by dumps. I'll put like five of them. What do I care? Floating garbage collector? Oh, an incinerator. Here we go. Does this hit everybody? I can't tell. Is this going to hit like a bunch of people? Where should I put it? Oh, the dump trucks will clog it. Yeah. Alright. That's fine. Up here. Incinerator. Power. Here we go. Pay tolls to dump garbage. Alright. Is this working? Two dollars. Four dollars. Okay. Two. Wait a minute. Wait. They're avoiding.

1852
06:20:16,810 --> 06:21:55,979
They're getting off at another exit. The one before. Oh. I don't want to pay the tolls. How the fuck do you get out of here? You can't get out. Can you? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Excuse me. Excuse me. That's not happening anymore. They have to turn. They can eventually get on this road and go this way. Not anymore. Wait, what? Wrong one? What do you mean wrong one? These are both going to attach to here. That would mean no way into the city. Yes, there is.

1853
06:21:55,979 --> 06:22:11,060
Because once we get to about here, I will connect this to this road here. No, I'll connect it to here. From here to here. If you want to leave, then you have to go through the rest of the tolls. If you want to stay in the city, then fucking come this way.

1854
06:22:11,060 --> 06:23:28,029
This game is so fun. I can't believe you can actually do this shit. Alright. Let's keep doing what I was doing. Do these people die? Okay. You can like leave this way. I don't know if I'm okay with that. Am I? Alright. There we go.

1855
06:23:28,529 --> 06:23:33,279
I have to go down there.

1856
06:23:41,869 --> 06:23:57,779
Oh shit. Okay, let's see. Does this work? Grand city.

1857
06:23:57,779 --> 06:24:16,790
Oh no. Oh shit. There's another way in. There's another way into the city. There's like three ways into the city. Oh no.

1858
06:24:23,319 --> 06:24:36,689
Not anymore. Keep going. Oh, what's this? Keep going. Roads closed.

1859
06:24:38,069 --> 06:25:00,479
Keep going. Good luck. This is going to be a bigger road. Upgrade. Oh, I can't upgrade that. Alright, so this could just be deleted. There's no reason for this. Okay, people can come out. That's fine.

1860
06:25:00,479 --> 06:25:09,540
Yeah, this is alright. And then we'll just connect this shit right here. Whatever. Fuck it. Go like this. Oops.

1861
06:25:12,639 --> 06:25:59,400
Straight dog? There. Look. Now you can fucking go this way. And come back into the city. Does it work? How are people avoiding this? Uh oh. What have I missed? What have I missed?

1862
06:26:02,180 --> 06:26:37,150
There's no way in? Oh shit. Okay, yeah. From here to here. Now there is. Okay, good. Now here they all come. Perfect. Beautiful. Beautiful.

1863
06:26:37,150 --> 06:27:14,180
We missed a road. People have to be able to leave. That means they can never leave. They're just always going to be constantly going around in a circle through my tolls. Forever.

1864
06:27:14,180 --> 06:27:34,459
What's going on with the power situation here? I need, okay, I need more electricity. Electric, electric, electric. What do I want?

1865
06:27:34,959 --> 06:27:53,419
Um, how about a, I don't know, this fucking solar power plant. I got money. Let's make it. Put it down here. Who cares?

1866
06:27:53,419 --> 06:28:03,090
Is this industry or houses? No. What's the industry? Oh, everything's gone up here. Wait. I'm still turned around. It's over here. Okay.

1867
06:28:03,090 --> 06:28:31,810
There we go. Bang. Tons and tons of fucking energy now. Very good. These need power though. How are they not being powered? There we go. Alright. Back in business.

1868
06:28:32,310 --> 06:28:52,939
Wait, where are these people coming from? Oh, yes, you can leave. Yes, you can. After you go through all the bullshit, you can actually leave.

1869
06:28:52,939 --> 06:29:02,700
The only exit out of the whole town is right here. Toll dodgers? No, they're not. That's not possible. How come I'm not making more money than this?

1870
06:29:02,700 --> 06:29:43,900
This is like six dollars a car. Is this counting? They're tailgating. I need more. Alright, here we go. Nobody's calling me a psycho. Whatever.

1871
06:29:47,400 --> 06:30:06,709
Cars charged last week. Here we go. A hundred and forty-five? Excuse me. Excuse me, this is bullshit. Um, how is that possible? Why is there not counting people?

1872
06:30:06,709 --> 06:30:39,869
Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Less people have been charged? This is the... This has got to be ten thousand cars going through here.

1873
06:30:39,869 --> 06:30:59,110
One-nineteen. One-twenty. One person got through. One-nineteen. Dude, there's hundreds of cars going through. One hundred and thirty-two cars. That's it?

1874
06:30:59,110 --> 06:31:20,040
That's unbelievable. It takes a day to go through the toll. Okay, this is getting bad. But they all have a hundred. So if there's a hundred cars per day...

1875
06:31:20,540 --> 06:31:33,189
I don't get this. This math. A hundred times two is two hundred dollars. Let's just do the math if it was just all cars. Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen.

1876
06:31:33,189 --> 06:32:05,549
That's two thousand dollars a week. Is that what we're doing? Better be. All this for two thousand dollars a week. We'll just wait until there's fifteen of them.

1877
06:32:06,549 --> 06:32:39,869
Toll income. Thirty-six hundred dollars a week. Toll income. You need seventeen thousand five hundred cars to pay off one booth. Are you shitting me?

1878
06:32:39,869 --> 06:33:04,360
It's a hundred and twenty dollars a week to upkeep them. Long term. Yeah, in like forty years this will be worth it. What's wrong with the Statue of Liberty?

1879
06:33:04,360 --> 06:33:22,799
The Statue of Liberty is currently being robbed. Some people are just getting out of their cars and looting the Statue of Liberty.

1880
06:33:22,799 --> 06:33:53,520
Oh yeah? You all think you're so smart, don't you? Oh, interesting. Replace the dirt roads? I mean, I kind of can't. Go arrest whoever's doing this shit. Where are they?

1881
06:33:53,520 --> 06:34:17,200
Oh wait, the cop can't leave. Oh wait, how's the cop going to get anywhere? He's trying to squeeze in. He has to pay the toll. The cops have to pay the toll too. I lost him. Where's the car?

1882
06:34:17,200 --> 06:35:37,290
This is an absolute mess. Most attractive city award. Thank you. Hey, stop. I think I'm done. I think I'm done. I think I'm done for today. I'm done for today. I'm going to save this. Game saved.

1883
06:35:37,290 --> 06:37:23,680
Okay, so. I kind of fucked this all up. So tomorrow, open the natural disaster tab. The bottom? What the hell is that? In landscaping? Wait, I can do this? Earthquake? Sinkhole? I didn't do anything. Meteor strike? Why is it not doing it?

1884
06:37:23,680 --> 06:38:01,139
Slider? What's this? 5.1? Severity? 10? More for it to go faster. Alright, I saved it. How come they're not showing up? It's coming.

1885
06:38:25,139 --> 06:38:27,139
Wait, another one?

1886
06:38:37,090 --> 06:38:39,090
Eh.

1887
06:38:51,919 --> 06:38:53,919
Wait, what is this?

1888
06:38:55,919 --> 06:38:57,919
Wait, is it a meteor?

1889
06:39:02,919 --> 06:39:06,119
What is this? Lightning?

1890
06:39:14,319 --> 06:39:27,639
The residents should seek shelter immediately if any is available. A meteor strike has occurred. Avoid the impact site and head to shelter if any is available.

1891
06:39:28,639 --> 06:39:44,729
A meteor strike has occurred. Avoid the impact site and head to shelter if any is available.

1892
06:39:55,250 --> 06:40:31,709
What is this? Deep freeze? Oh no, no. Collapse. What does this do? Where's the dinosaur one? Dinosaur? That's Sim City. Alright, let's speed it up. I want to see this next one.

1893
06:40:33,590 --> 06:40:37,529
I might play this again. Maybe I'll play this tomorrow. Again.

1894
06:40:37,529 --> 06:40:39,840
And we'll...

1895
06:40:41,840 --> 06:40:43,840
Either this or...

1896
06:40:44,840 --> 06:40:52,009
I feel like you kind of can't start Animal Crossing if you're in the middle of Fuckface City.

1897
06:40:52,009 --> 06:41:02,159
A thunderstorm is battering the city. Stay indoors until the storm has passed.

1898
06:41:36,810 --> 06:41:49,880
Get out of here! What was the next thing I did?

1899
06:42:07,119 --> 06:42:11,200
What a storm. I hope no one's hurt. Holy shit.

1900
06:42:12,200 --> 06:42:31,049
Didn't I do another one? I did like this one. Tsunami? Let's see what it looks like. Tsunami takes forever. Oh.

1901
06:42:32,049 --> 06:42:47,919
In the water. Tsunami with the poop water. Oh no.

1902
06:42:47,919 --> 06:43:00,119
Don't know how people... It's just locked down right there.

1903
06:43:01,119 --> 06:43:06,000
Multiple problems. Environmental activity is high.

1904
06:43:08,080 --> 06:43:21,979
I want to see the... I want to see it. This takes a long fucking time.

1905
06:43:25,970 --> 06:43:29,279
Still earning $3,500 a week. Somehow.

1906
06:43:44,209 --> 06:44:09,200
Look at the horizon. I don't see shit. I see it. No you don't. There's nothing coming. It's not even coming.

1907
06:44:21,380 --> 06:44:25,639
You don't see. I don't see anything. Alright, this is not even happening.

1908
06:44:25,639 --> 06:44:45,459
What do you mean? Wait, is this just it? No, that's a burnt forest. Turn around.

1909
06:45:02,759 --> 06:45:03,759
Oh my god.

1910
06:45:04,759 --> 06:45:06,759
The Coast Guard is warning of a tsunami approaching the area. Oh, thanks!

1911
06:45:07,759 --> 06:45:09,759
Residents should avoid roads and waterfronts.

1912
06:45:10,759 --> 06:45:16,759
A tsunami has struck the city. Take caution and avoid roads and waterfronts until the water recedes.

1913
06:45:17,759 --> 06:46:01,819
Alright, I'm out of here. I'm done. See you guys later. I'll see you tomorrow. No!

1914
06:46:01,819 --> 06:46:19,610
No! How are you supposed to avoid this shit?

1915
06:46:20,610 --> 06:46:26,040
The tsunami has hit the city. Take caution and avoid roads and waterfronts until the water recedes.

1916
06:46:27,040 --> 06:46:29,540
I did. Don't I already know this?

1917
06:46:58,169 --> 06:47:06,529
What's with their obsession with the blimps? Why are these people happy over here?

1918
06:47:07,529 --> 06:47:13,529
The tsunami has struck the city. Take caution and avoid roads and waterfronts until the water recedes.

1919
06:47:14,529 --> 06:47:24,180
Uh oh, it's mixing. Alright, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm done.

1920
06:47:24,180 --> 06:47:37,599
I'm done. Let me just double check. This is okay. Hey, we're fine.

1921
06:47:39,090 --> 06:47:41,090
Hey! Cool, cool, cool. Very good, very good, very good.

1922
06:47:42,090 --> 06:47:45,159
Alright, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow.

1923
06:47:46,159 --> 06:47:50,470
We're either going to do this or more. I might. I don't know. It's up in the air.

1924
06:47:54,779 --> 06:48:04,919
I think this is fun. I'm either going to continue doing this, start Animal Crossing, or something else completely different.

1925
06:48:05,919 --> 06:48:12,560
We'll see. This was fucking hilarious though. This was absolutely worth playing at least once or twice.

1926
06:48:17,509 --> 06:48:22,000
We'll see. I'll be around pre-stream tomorrow. Thanks for watching. Game is saved, don't worry.

1927
06:48:23,000 --> 06:48:29,840
Uh, that was hilarious. But, we are going to say our goodbyes.

1928
06:48:33,380 --> 06:48:36,810
See you tomorrow. Thanks for watching. Thanks for hanging out, as always.

1929
06:48:37,810 --> 06:48:45,080
Doom? Wait, oh, Doom. Just Doom comes out. There's a lot of shit that's coming out, huh?

1930
06:48:46,080 --> 06:48:51,009
There is a lot of fucking stuff coming out, isn't there?

1931
06:48:53,919 --> 06:48:55,919
It's already out. Oh, shit.

1932
06:48:57,409 --> 06:48:59,409
Oh, that's going to be, I don't know. I'm going to have to, I don't know.

1933
06:49:00,409 --> 06:49:01,409
I have no idea what's going to happen tomorrow.

1934
06:49:03,549 --> 06:49:05,549
But, let's go do the bits and the subs and everything.

1935
06:49:06,979 --> 06:49:07,979
Thanks again for watching. See you tomorrow.

1936
06:49:11,270 --> 06:49:15,270
Uh, produces Asan. Thanks for the five community subs. I missed it earlier.

1937
06:49:16,270 --> 06:49:17,270
I think that was right before the stream started.

1938
06:49:20,110 --> 06:49:22,110
And with Wings, thanks for five dollars. Oh well, sounds like it's scuffed.

1939
06:49:23,110 --> 06:49:27,409
Guess you could just play Doom instead. Huh? We didn't play Doom? We played this?

1940
06:49:27,409 --> 06:49:30,549
Sam, thanks for the three dollars, Sam.

1941
06:49:31,549 --> 06:49:35,720
Dermot, you will end up building a maze of a city and I'm alright with that.

1942
06:49:36,720 --> 06:49:43,110
It's alright. I did a pretty good job, I think.

1943
06:49:44,110 --> 06:49:56,389
Ah, thank you Freak8 out for a hundred dollars over many donations.

1944
06:49:57,389 --> 06:50:01,880
I'm going to pre-screen your messages. I'm just going to make sure I pre-screen these.

1945
06:50:02,880 --> 06:50:04,880
Because this is the porn guy for Lizzie that don't know.

1946
06:50:05,880 --> 06:50:09,569
Wait, didn't I ban this person from giving messages? I think I did.

1947
06:50:09,569 --> 06:50:15,279
I did. I already did. Yeah, I did that, right? I remember that.

1948
06:50:19,849 --> 06:50:21,849
Alright, I'm going to scan through and we'll take a look.

1949
06:50:22,849 --> 06:50:31,889
Dermot, I'm watching for a few years now. Well, thank you Freak8 out for the hundred dollars you gave over many different donations.

1950
06:50:32,889 --> 06:50:42,569
Read them silently. I'll pick out some words here. Let's see if this is appropriate for stream. We'll find out.

1951
06:50:43,569 --> 06:50:46,479
I've been watching for years. It's been a while.

1952
06:50:47,479 --> 06:50:50,479
But due to the virus, I didn't get many hours in February when the news first started reporting it.

1953
06:50:50,479 --> 06:50:54,650
I was fired two weeks ago from Honda. It's because someone ratted me out.

1954
06:50:55,650 --> 06:50:57,650
I would use to make cocktails in the back room and share them with the guys at work.

1955
06:50:58,650 --> 06:51:04,130
Alright, one time there's this guy. I wonder how it all started. One time there's this guy named Fred.

1956
06:51:05,130 --> 06:51:11,200
Okay, he gave me some Jim Bean. Okay, I figured I wasn't going to drink it straight.

1957
06:51:12,200 --> 06:51:18,790
Okay, what's next? Okay, I shared it with the guys. About a month or two went by. It was slow.

1958
06:51:18,790 --> 06:51:33,639
Okay, I started to mix up something. I call it a new drink. I made 7-ups. It's 7-up and whiskey.

1959
06:51:34,639 --> 06:51:39,209
Okay, people liked it. I began to bring stuff every week. Sure, okay.

1960
06:51:40,209 --> 06:51:45,729
I thought this girl started working there. I thought she was cute. Okay.

1961
06:51:46,729 --> 06:51:53,279
I didn't know how. Okay, okay, okay. What's the point of this?

1962
06:51:53,279 --> 06:51:59,840
What's the point of this? This is going to be like an end here.

1963
06:52:00,840 --> 06:52:05,040
There's going to be an end here, isn't there? I'm going to read it out loud.

1964
06:52:06,919 --> 06:52:11,680
Okay, I started to talk to her. Okay, I brought her Long Island iced teas.

1965
06:52:12,680 --> 06:52:14,849
Okay, you name it. Someone ratted on me.

1966
06:52:17,180 --> 06:52:21,180
In two weeks, luckily, my tax returns have been helping out. Not many dealerships are hiring right now.

1967
06:52:22,869 --> 06:52:29,799
I hope you're doing well. I have bought towels. You dirty boy. I saw that you played Binding of Isaac and not well versed in the Bible.

1968
06:52:29,799 --> 06:52:33,099
Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger reading the book of Genesis.

1969
06:52:34,099 --> 06:52:38,040
I wanted to ask, can you talk for the next 15 minutes in a Boomhauer accent?

1970
06:52:39,040 --> 06:52:44,799
Okay, this actually wasn't even that bad. I don't think this story is accurate.

1971
06:52:48,209 --> 06:52:51,209
This story is not even accurate. This is not even a real story, I don't think.

1972
06:52:53,479 --> 06:52:58,479
Apparently getting fired for bringing alcohol to work. Don't do that. It's a fucking huge mistake.

1973
06:52:59,479 --> 06:53:10,869
It is accurate. I'm the girl. Freak out, you freaking me out. You freak me out, I'll tell you.

1974
06:53:10,869 --> 06:53:18,200
I'm the drink, it's true. I'm the guy that fired him.

1975
06:53:19,569 --> 06:53:25,259
Well, regardless if this story is real or not, if it is, you shouldn't be doing that. Why would you be doing that?

1976
06:53:26,439 --> 06:53:31,439
It's not real. It's not a real story. But I'm sorry about you getting fired in this story that I don't think is real.

1977
06:53:32,439 --> 06:53:38,919
But thank you for the fucking $100 due to a lot of money. Freak out, you're freaking me out. Thank you.

1978
06:53:39,919 --> 06:53:43,400
It's 100% real, it's true.

1979
06:53:44,400 --> 06:53:49,450
Opster Narwhal, thanks for the $4.

1980
06:54:01,000 --> 06:54:04,630
You gotta have at least five or six mascots dancing around. That's all that matters.

1981
06:54:08,619 --> 06:54:13,119
As long as there's at least five to ten mascots in the front door, it could look however you want it to look.

1982
06:54:14,119 --> 06:54:20,369
Good luck though. I mean, if it's real, you shouldn't feel bad.

1983
06:54:21,369 --> 06:54:28,220
If you're bringing fucking alcohol to work and giving it to people, you're gonna get fired.

1984
06:54:29,220 --> 06:54:38,099
What do you want me to tell you? If you start bringing booze to work and drinking on the job and giving it to all the coworkers, you're going to get fired.

1985
06:54:39,099 --> 06:54:50,099
The boss is gonna be like, hey, this is not like an old movie from the fucking 90s where the boss comes in, hey, what's going on in here? Are you drinking?

1986
06:54:51,099 --> 06:54:52,400
Yeah, man, we're drinking.

1987
06:54:52,400 --> 06:54:57,400
Oh, well, you think you're gonna get in? Let me have some, boys.

1988
06:54:58,400 --> 06:55:04,909
That's not how this works. You're gonna lose your job if you do that. Don't do that.

1989
06:55:05,909 --> 06:55:20,279
Jerma sucks when he spits the truth. What? What are you talking about?

1990
06:55:21,720 --> 06:55:28,029
Hey Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250. Jerma, thank you very much for streaming and keeping everyone entertained.

1991
06:55:29,029 --> 06:55:33,029
I'm from London and it's gotten really crazy here and more than likely a lockdown is happening next week.

1992
06:55:33,029 --> 06:55:40,029
A local hospital had to be shut down today as well, but I'm still keeping positive. People like yourself streaming is getting us all entertained.

1993
06:55:41,029 --> 06:55:45,029
All I can say, don't take risks at all and look after yourselves and love ones much love.

1994
06:55:46,029 --> 06:56:02,689
Yeah, I talked about this earlier. I'm not trying to be your mother. I know people made that joke, but you'd be surprised at how many people when they know they just do it anyways, they'll just go somewhere anyways.

1995
06:56:02,689 --> 06:56:19,900
You'd be surprised. If you have a lockdown going on, don't take any chances. Only get essential things that you need. Just ride this shit out.

1996
06:56:20,900 --> 06:56:35,060
Shut up, mom. I would be a very good mom, okay? I'd be a good father. I'd be like, hey, excuse me. What are you guys doing in here?

1997
06:56:36,060 --> 06:56:56,799
Dad in the wall. Nothing. All right. Good night, boys. I don't know. I'm not a father. I don't know how this works.

1998
06:56:59,759 --> 06:57:08,000
Take care of yourself, Wembley. Don't fuck around. Do not mess around with a city or statewide lockdown. There's a reason why they're in place.

1999
06:57:10,779 --> 06:57:16,040
Take care of yourselves. Take care of your loved ones. Take care of your friends. Just let's try to ride this out.

2000
06:57:19,139 --> 06:57:29,900
We also had a ton of money come in. Freddie Dread gave $200 in bits. Zyxia gave 100 community subs. Chris gave $50 in bits. Just a shitload of money. Thank you guys.

2001
06:57:29,900 --> 06:57:42,069
All in the same five-minute span here a few hours ago. BS88, thanks for the $3. Jeremy, this is exciting to see you play this.

2002
06:57:43,069 --> 06:57:52,950
The girlfriend and I had a great time building a city in this and we both love it. Awesome to see you play it. Be sure to check out Biffa. He has great tips and tricks, particularly on traffic.

2003
06:57:53,950 --> 06:58:03,439
Yeah, I didn't really understand that traffic was the thing. I thought you just built roads and I didn't know that was a real thing.

2004
06:58:03,439 --> 06:58:13,799
I wonder if people, these games, this game people can probably get so elaborate with it. I can imagine the obsessive kind of, you could make so many highways so perfect.

2005
06:58:14,799 --> 06:58:22,509
I can imagine how cool that would be if only I was capable. But thank you. Thanks a lot.

2006
06:58:23,509 --> 06:58:30,639
Ruta Miss, thanks for the $5. Jeremy, my 30th birthday was yesterday. Can I get Bugleberry to give some words of wisdom on getting older?

2007
06:58:31,639 --> 06:58:33,270
Yeah, sure.

2008
06:58:56,680 --> 06:58:58,500
Get the fuck out of here.

2009
06:59:00,830 --> 06:59:11,919
Okay. I believe that was good enough. Happy 30th birthday. Thanks a lot.

2010
06:59:12,919 --> 06:59:20,209
Hey, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $2.50. Your aging Boston accent is slowly just morphing into Bernie's.

2011
06:59:21,209 --> 06:59:32,540
All right, we're going to lower the taxes on the citizens to 7%.

2012
06:59:33,540 --> 06:59:39,720
Fuck yeah. I didn't think I was even doing Bernie. It was. I didn't even mean to. It just happened.

2013
06:59:40,720 --> 06:59:48,220
Hey, just some normal guy, 25, thanks for the $5. Jeremy, please build an elementary school for us.

2014
06:59:49,220 --> 06:59:53,220
The people here are too stupid and are parking out on the road instead of on their, of their garages.

2015
06:59:54,220 --> 06:59:59,220
They're all eating bug donuts and someone built a power line right outside my house. Help them.

2016
07:00:00,220 --> 07:00:07,569
Uh, Disorge Captiva, $100 in bits. We, we went over these, but insane amounts of money.

2017
07:00:08,569 --> 07:00:12,569
Snarbosus, I didn't even see this. How did I fucking miss this? 20 community subs from Snarbosus.

2018
07:00:12,569 --> 07:00:21,009
That's a shitload. How did I miss that? What was going on? That's a 20 drop.

2019
07:00:22,009 --> 07:00:29,869
Thank you, Snarbosus. If you're still here, that's a lot of money. Thank you.

2020
07:00:53,689 --> 07:01:01,119
Uh, happy Homeacademy points. Wait, he wasn't playing Animal Crossing. No, I wasn't. You're wrong, not me.

2021
07:01:02,119 --> 07:01:09,189
Thanks though. Maybe I, ah, fuck, what am I going to do tomorrow?

2022
07:01:10,189 --> 07:01:13,189
I'm going to have to like flip a three-sided coin tomorrow and figure out what the hell I want to do.

2023
07:01:14,189 --> 07:01:15,189
There's too much shit that's out.

2024
07:01:15,189 --> 07:01:19,560
Appleship, thanks for the 250. Yo man, I'm sure it's already been asked, but how's quarantine treating you?

2025
07:01:20,560 --> 07:01:24,560
Hope you're doing alright. My school's been cancelled for the time being, so I've been catching up on Vodswell.

2026
07:01:25,560 --> 07:01:27,560
Sitting around drawing, which is definitely a silver lining to all this.

2027
07:01:29,240 --> 07:01:33,549
Um, just been sitting around and hanging out.

2028
07:01:34,849 --> 07:01:46,849
We thankfully got, a few weeks ago, the last two weeks before, um, the, I mean, if you don't know, Vegas is now, the state of Nevada is on essential business lockdown.

2029
07:01:47,849 --> 07:01:54,849
Which is, grocery stores are open, and, uh, I think like banks and, uh, like hospitals and everything.

2030
07:01:55,849 --> 07:01:59,849
But all non-essential businesses are not open anymore in Las Vegas, so.

2031
07:02:00,849 --> 07:02:05,220
Following suit for a lot of other towns and cities in the world and in the country.

2032
07:02:06,220 --> 07:02:08,520
But yeah, I haven't really, I haven't left the house really.

2033
07:02:09,520 --> 07:02:12,520
I've had some stuff, I've had some really, really important, here's the worst part about this.

2034
07:02:13,520 --> 07:02:20,520
There's a lot of important shit that's going on in my like current life that is hard to take care of now.

2035
07:02:20,520 --> 07:02:27,279
For those of you that do not know, I haven't really talked that much about it because I didn't want to make a big deal about it.

2036
07:02:28,279 --> 07:02:29,279
I've been talking about it in a pre-stream recently.

2037
07:02:30,279 --> 07:02:31,279
But I am moving.

2038
07:02:32,580 --> 07:02:33,580
Kim and I are moving to a new place.

2039
07:02:35,970 --> 07:02:37,970
And it's happening very soon.

2040
07:02:39,150 --> 07:02:40,150
And it's just like, holy shit.

2041
07:02:41,150 --> 07:02:43,150
This all is coming at this point right now.

2042
07:02:44,150 --> 07:02:45,150
Uh, we're staying in Vegas.

2043
07:02:46,150 --> 07:02:47,150
No, no, no, we're not moving, we're staying in Las Vegas.

2044
07:02:48,150 --> 07:02:49,150
We're not moving back to Boston.

2045
07:02:49,150 --> 07:03:00,020
So with the, this is essentially the first year or two here was to see if we really liked it.

2046
07:03:01,020 --> 07:03:03,450
And then, okay, did, did we like this?

2047
07:03:04,450 --> 07:03:05,450
Did we want to stay?

2048
07:03:07,650 --> 07:03:12,959
We wanted to downsize a little bit and there's a lot of reasons as to why we wanted to change places.

2049
07:03:13,959 --> 07:03:14,959
I wanted to get better internet.

2050
07:03:15,959 --> 07:03:19,860
There's another one with the fucking people driving by, the vroomers.

2051
07:03:21,229 --> 07:03:22,229
That was like 75% off.

2052
07:03:25,389 --> 07:03:27,560
But that's happening very soon.

2053
07:03:27,560 --> 07:03:32,060
But I haven't really talked about it because I don't want to be like, hey, I'm moving again.

2054
07:03:33,060 --> 07:03:34,060
Everybody get ready or where the fuck is he going?

2055
07:03:35,060 --> 07:03:37,430
No, I'm staying in Las Vegas.

2056
07:03:38,430 --> 07:03:39,430
Just a different place.

2057
07:03:40,430 --> 07:03:48,020
Please keep a place where people will still vroom.

2058
07:03:49,020 --> 07:03:50,020
That's such a big deal.

2059
07:03:51,020 --> 07:03:55,020
I call up a bunch of, apartment complex number 15.

2060
07:03:56,020 --> 07:03:59,020
Hey, do cars like fucking drive by really fast?

2061
07:04:00,709 --> 07:04:03,590
Um, I don't think so.

2062
07:04:04,590 --> 07:04:05,590
I'm just sorry.

2063
07:04:06,590 --> 07:04:11,860
Not interested.

2064
07:04:15,150 --> 07:04:20,090
Okay. But yeah, but it's been the last few weeks.

2065
07:04:21,090 --> 07:04:25,090
We're trying to figure out the smoothest way to make this a reality.

2066
07:04:26,840 --> 07:04:28,840
And it kind of landed on the worst possible time.

2067
07:04:30,340 --> 07:04:31,959
So we still are doing it.

2068
07:04:32,959 --> 07:04:37,290
That and the medical shit that I'm doing right now.

2069
07:04:38,290 --> 07:04:42,290
I'm trying to stay on top of it and trying to, but I, you can't really, it's hard to do that now.

2070
07:04:42,290 --> 07:04:47,750
So a lot of shit in real life is starting to get affected by it too.

2071
07:04:48,750 --> 07:04:51,650
But you do what you got to do.

2072
07:04:53,080 --> 07:04:59,389
And hopefully over the next month or two, this will start to flatten out as they say and get better.

2073
07:05:01,909 --> 07:05:05,909
All we can hope is over the next two, three, four months that this starts to really be on the way out.

2074
07:05:06,909 --> 07:05:07,909
We just have to just try.

2075
07:05:08,909 --> 07:05:16,200
But that's kind of the way it's been the last couple of weeks.

2076
07:05:17,200 --> 07:05:18,200
But thanks for the 250 Apple shift.

2077
07:05:19,200 --> 07:05:20,200
Appreciate it.

2078
07:05:24,319 --> 07:05:25,319
Thanks for the three dollars.

2079
07:05:26,319 --> 07:05:30,560
I'd like to remind everyone that despite current events, my German themed birthday party is still scheduled for next week.

2080
07:05:31,869 --> 07:05:32,869
Oh, I'm going to burp.

2081
07:05:33,869 --> 07:05:38,869
So sadly, Nvidia will no longer be attending this year as Greg has contracted it.

2082
07:05:39,869 --> 07:05:41,869
We're making up for their absence with something even more exciting.

2083
07:05:42,869 --> 07:05:43,869
A sub-only ball bit.

2084
07:05:44,869 --> 07:05:47,869
And those still concerned about the spread of the disease will be providing essential oils free of charge.

2085
07:05:48,869 --> 07:05:52,990
Hope to catch all of you there.

2086
07:05:53,990 --> 07:05:55,990
A ball, no, it's a ball bit as it says.

2087
07:05:55,990 --> 07:05:57,549
Essential oils.

2088
07:05:58,549 --> 07:06:02,860
What? Why would I get?

2089
07:06:03,860 --> 07:06:04,860
Why would I want an essential oil?

2090
07:06:11,349 --> 07:06:13,869
I don't get it. Thanks for three bucks though.

2091
07:06:16,709 --> 07:06:17,709
Stripes Beast, thanks for 250.

2092
07:06:18,709 --> 07:06:23,709
Hey Jerm, just let you know that in your landfill neighborhood, people were building houses and getting sick and dying.

2093
07:06:24,709 --> 07:06:27,229
Then abandoning the house.

2094
07:06:28,229 --> 07:06:30,229
A new house would get built over the old one.

2095
07:06:31,229 --> 07:06:32,229
The cycle repeats.

2096
07:06:46,110 --> 07:06:47,110
You're laughing. Yeah.

2097
07:06:47,110 --> 07:06:48,110
What do you want me to do? Not?

2098
07:06:49,110 --> 07:06:50,110
That's stupid.

2099
07:06:51,110 --> 07:06:52,110
That's fucking ridiculous.

2100
07:06:53,110 --> 07:06:55,500
Why is that happening?

2101
07:06:56,500 --> 07:06:57,500
That's fucking terrible.

2102
07:06:58,500 --> 07:07:01,500
It's like a secret tunnel.

2103
07:07:08,049 --> 07:07:09,049
Thank you Stripes Beast for the 250.

2104
07:07:10,049 --> 07:07:11,049
Thank you Silent Serenity for the 250.

2105
07:07:12,049 --> 07:07:14,049
Jerm, you have some seriously boomer-esque city planning skills.

2106
07:07:15,049 --> 07:07:16,229
I love it.

2107
07:07:17,229 --> 07:07:18,229
That was so much traffic.

2108
07:07:19,229 --> 07:07:22,229
Fun fact, statistical evidence suggests as you saw that adding more lanes only temporarily fixes traffic.

2109
07:07:23,229 --> 07:07:25,229
The only true solution is to have a better design.

2110
07:07:26,229 --> 07:07:27,470
Cheers.

2111
07:07:28,470 --> 07:07:35,470
Actually, it's funny because rotaries are supposed to be the end-all-be-all best possible way to end all traffic.

2112
07:07:36,470 --> 07:07:39,840
A shitload of rotaries is how you fix traffic.

2113
07:07:40,840 --> 07:07:49,520
It's not more lanes. It's not more roads. It's rotaries.

2114
07:07:50,520 --> 07:07:54,680
It's true. Look it up.

2115
07:07:55,680 --> 07:07:57,240
Rotary is a Boston word.

2116
07:07:58,240 --> 07:07:59,740
Yeah, that's fine.

2117
07:07:59,740 --> 07:08:00,740
Roundabout. There you go.

2118
07:08:01,740 --> 07:08:02,740
Roundabout. Roundabout. Sorry.

2119
07:08:03,740 --> 07:08:04,740
I'm from a different part of the world than you. Sorry.

2120
07:08:05,740 --> 07:08:07,740
Let me apologize first and foremost.

2121
07:08:14,360 --> 07:08:15,360
He's speaking in code.

2122
07:08:20,689 --> 07:08:21,689
Anyways.

2123
07:08:23,639 --> 07:08:25,639
Castle Build, thanks for the $5.90.

2124
07:08:27,069 --> 07:08:30,069
Hey Jerm, unfortunately I will no longer be able to help out due to the end of my academic career.

2125
07:08:31,069 --> 07:08:33,069
And therefore the end of my student prime.

2126
07:08:34,500 --> 07:08:35,500
I've loved your work since 2013. Keep it up.

2127
07:08:36,500 --> 07:08:38,500
Hope you stay safe during these turbulent times.

2128
07:08:40,509 --> 07:08:41,509
Hope you do too.

2129
07:08:43,259 --> 07:08:48,209
Because here's the real...

2130
07:08:49,209 --> 07:08:52,209
I mean I don't want to get too far into the future on this.

2131
07:08:53,520 --> 07:08:59,009
But if everyone's having trouble, you know, it's harder to...

2132
07:09:00,009 --> 07:09:05,340
Like when this stream turns on and let's say it keeps going further, like six months from now,

2133
07:09:08,180 --> 07:09:11,180
I'm not sure if we really keep going harder and harder and harder on this.

2134
07:09:12,180 --> 07:09:14,180
I'd like to try to stay positive and try to have fun on these streams.

2135
07:09:15,180 --> 07:09:17,439
I just really hope it doesn't get there.

2136
07:09:17,439 --> 07:09:22,220
Like a year from now, six months from now. I hope it's really fucking over with.

2137
07:09:23,220 --> 07:09:26,220
I hope we can really get over this as a group, a global group.

2138
07:09:27,220 --> 07:09:32,060
Because if it's hard to get like water or something,

2139
07:09:33,060 --> 07:09:38,349
I'll be honest with you, I don't want to turn my stream on and be like,

2140
07:09:39,349 --> 07:09:40,349
Hey everybody!

2141
07:09:43,349 --> 07:09:54,000
That's unfortunate, but I really don't want it to be that like that.

2142
07:09:55,000 --> 07:09:57,000
I really don't want to get to a point where it's hopefully...

2143
07:09:57,000 --> 07:10:01,490
It's just every day we just keep hearing about this shit and I really hope it's on the way out.

2144
07:10:02,490 --> 07:10:07,290
I'll keep doing it. I will keep fucking streaming it.

2145
07:10:08,290 --> 07:10:10,290
I'll keep trying to have as much fun as I can.

2146
07:10:11,290 --> 07:10:23,400
But honestly, I just want to be honest with you.

2147
07:10:24,400 --> 07:10:28,430
Even right now, for instance, right?

2148
07:10:29,430 --> 07:10:33,430
If I'm having problems in my life, it's hard for me to come on here and make a bunch of jokes.

2149
07:10:34,430 --> 07:10:38,840
Especially if something serious is going on.

2150
07:10:45,720 --> 07:10:48,209
But I don't think we'll get that far.

2151
07:10:48,209 --> 07:10:50,209
I mean, I say I don't think because I really hope we don't.

2152
07:10:51,209 --> 07:10:52,209
But I'll be here.

2153
07:11:00,240 --> 07:11:01,669
Regardless of what we're doing, I'll be here.

2154
07:11:02,669 --> 07:11:05,869
I've got no reason to stop. I'm not going to stop doing it.

2155
07:11:06,869 --> 07:11:23,360
And I think that sometimes having laughing and having a good time and making jokes and making comedy helps with everything.

2156
07:11:24,360 --> 07:11:25,360
No matter what it is.

2157
07:11:26,360 --> 07:11:31,909
But obviously I'm overthinking what could potentially happen in the future.

2158
07:11:32,909 --> 07:11:34,080
But we'll see.

2159
07:11:38,459 --> 07:11:39,959
Making comedies.

2160
07:11:40,959 --> 07:11:50,560
Cease to review refuses to stop.

2161
07:11:51,560 --> 07:11:53,880
Now, you know what I mean, though.

2162
07:11:56,020 --> 07:11:58,029
Anyway, take care of yourselves, please.

2163
07:11:59,029 --> 07:12:02,040
Captain O.W., thanks for the $5.

2164
07:12:03,040 --> 07:12:05,040
Use this to go to city building school, Omega Lo.

2165
07:12:06,040 --> 07:12:09,259
That was pretty good.

2166
07:12:10,259 --> 07:12:11,560
That was pretty funny.

2167
07:12:19,650 --> 07:12:21,650
AllOfOneZombie, thanks for the $2.50. Great stream. Thanks, dude.

2168
07:12:22,650 --> 07:12:24,599
It was a lot of fun.

2169
07:12:26,599 --> 07:12:27,599
Flo, and thanks for the $4.

2170
07:12:28,599 --> 07:12:31,599
Watch you for so long lurking, but just want to say you're easily the only thing getting me through this whole quarantine situation.

2171
07:12:31,599 --> 07:12:32,599
Big love from England.

2172
07:12:33,599 --> 07:12:36,959
Take care of yourself.

2173
07:12:39,919 --> 07:12:40,919
All of you.

2174
07:12:42,680 --> 07:12:43,680
I'm trying to as well.

2175
07:12:44,680 --> 07:12:45,680
Off stream, I'm trying to do the same thing.

2176
07:12:47,110 --> 07:12:48,110
We're all trying to do the same thing right now.

2177
07:12:50,819 --> 07:12:53,020
Take care of yourself. Thank you.

2178
07:12:54,020 --> 07:13:02,020
Eggscramble, thanks for the $2.50. Eggs, milk, hummus, 97% lean ground, turkey, dried bay leaf, carrots, celery, sourdough, cheese nips, club soda for Uncle.

2179
07:13:03,020 --> 07:13:06,840
I have no idea what you're talking about, but all those things sounded good to me.

2180
07:13:07,840 --> 07:13:09,840
So, besides maybe the milk.

2181
07:13:10,840 --> 07:13:11,840
I don't really want that.

2182
07:13:15,700 --> 07:13:17,700
Turtle toenail, thanks for the $50, 5,000 bits.

2183
07:13:18,700 --> 07:13:28,729
Just a few moments ago. You should change the name to Toll City, then you'd get more, you'd get more German tourists and more money.

2184
07:13:29,729 --> 07:13:32,380
I don't understand.

2185
07:13:35,349 --> 07:13:45,400
Toll City? Is a EU joke?

2186
07:13:46,400 --> 07:13:49,150
Wait, does Germany have a bunch of tolls?

2187
07:13:50,150 --> 07:13:55,009
Toll means awesome in German.

2188
07:13:56,009 --> 07:14:00,409
Oh, I see. Okay.

2189
07:14:00,409 --> 07:14:06,470
Well, thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude. Seriously. Appreciate it.

2190
07:14:07,470 --> 07:14:13,729
Silence, Serenity, thanks for the $2.50. If you really want to play Animal Crossing on stream, I'd recommend you start it off stream.

2191
07:14:14,729 --> 07:14:15,729
If you haven't already.

2192
07:14:16,729 --> 07:14:17,729
The game is heavy, very heavily time gated.

2193
07:14:18,729 --> 07:14:22,729
And the first day gameplay is pretty much just putting your tent down and catching fish.

2194
07:14:23,729 --> 07:14:26,729
It would be a very slow stream. With that said, the game is very cute and relaxing.

2195
07:14:29,439 --> 07:14:32,130
Maybe I'll fucking... I don't know.

2196
07:14:36,189 --> 07:14:38,189
It's going to be a game time decision tomorrow. What I want to do.

2197
07:14:38,189 --> 07:14:39,189
We'll see.

2198
07:14:40,189 --> 07:14:46,479
Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the 300 bits. Hello, Germa. I really enjoy your streams.

2199
07:14:47,479 --> 07:14:53,479
About a year back, I submitted some custom Guitar Hero tracks, one being the Pirate Marching Band mixed with Tachyon by Death Grips.

2200
07:14:54,479 --> 07:14:56,479
The other being Berries and Sterries.

2201
07:14:57,479 --> 07:14:59,840
After this, you suggested the idea of an FL Studio stream.

2202
07:15:00,840 --> 07:15:05,840
I fully advocate this idea and along with it, we'd like to suggest a green screen-esque stream where instead of video, it's audio.

2203
07:15:06,840 --> 07:15:08,840
And you make funny noises to be remixed for a whole stream.

2204
07:15:08,840 --> 07:15:21,020
Well, dusting off in the vault of ideas that sit behind me, once upon a time, maybe a year or so ago, I wanted to not do...

2205
07:15:22,020 --> 07:15:24,020
The FL Studio thing was like, oh, that's pretty cool. What a good idea.

2206
07:15:25,020 --> 07:15:27,020
That's a funny thing to do is make like just music on stream.

2207
07:15:28,020 --> 07:15:30,020
Scratch that. I want to hire a whole band.

2208
07:15:31,020 --> 07:15:38,020
I want to have like 17 people here, like trumpet players, guitarists and stuff and record our own music.

2209
07:15:39,020 --> 07:15:41,020
And they have like an actual studio band.

2210
07:15:42,020 --> 07:15:46,799
And just have them do like samples and shit and just make songs.

2211
07:15:50,400 --> 07:15:53,400
That was, I mean, that was a year ago now that I wanted to do that.

2212
07:15:54,400 --> 07:15:56,400
And some things took precedence over others.

2213
07:15:57,900 --> 07:16:01,900
That idea was around before the carnival was even started having any work done on it, so.

2214
07:16:02,900 --> 07:16:06,900
But, it's just, it's in a gigantic book back there.

2215
07:16:10,889 --> 07:16:12,889
It has not been cancelled, it's just dusty. That's all.

2216
07:16:14,840 --> 07:16:15,840
It is still in the mine.

2217
07:16:15,840 --> 07:16:20,319
Jude Minecraft, thanks for the 300 bits.

2218
07:16:21,319 --> 07:16:23,319
Jerome, I've been feeling bad because of fibromyalgia and anemia.

2219
07:16:24,560 --> 07:16:26,560
Streams make me feel better when I have bad days.

2220
07:16:27,919 --> 07:16:28,919
I have an alert on my phone.

2221
07:16:29,919 --> 07:16:30,919
Hope you're doing okay. Keep yourself safe.

2222
07:16:31,919 --> 07:16:32,919
Tell Otto and Kim I said hi.

2223
07:16:37,169 --> 07:16:38,169
Sorry to feel, sorry that you're feeling that way.

2224
07:16:39,169 --> 07:16:40,169
Sorry that you feel so bad.

2225
07:16:44,930 --> 07:16:51,330
Fibromyalgia is one of those conditions that it's just tough to treat.

2226
07:16:51,330 --> 07:16:59,709
I know this because it's been potentially things that might be going on with me.

2227
07:17:00,709 --> 07:17:04,319
So I feel for that.

2228
07:17:05,319 --> 07:17:06,319
It hasn't been diagnosed, I'm not saying I'm diagnosed that way.

2229
07:17:07,319 --> 07:17:13,619
But this mystery illness with random fucking just chest bone and like spine pain.

2230
07:17:14,619 --> 07:17:18,419
I don't know.

2231
07:17:21,959 --> 07:17:26,720
Costochondritis and fibromyalgia both, they both kind of are hand in hand in a lot of ways.

2232
07:17:27,720 --> 07:17:37,700
But I might not even have costochondritis.

2233
07:17:37,700 --> 07:17:39,700
I might have fucking rheumatoid arthritis.

2234
07:17:40,700 --> 07:17:48,520
This is why medical shit is so fucking annoying and because it's been like a year and a half.

2235
07:17:49,520 --> 07:17:51,520
And I still don't know exactly what's fucking wrong with me.

2236
07:17:52,520 --> 07:17:54,080
So I can relate.

2237
07:17:55,080 --> 07:17:56,080
Trust me, I can.

2238
07:17:57,080 --> 07:18:00,759
Sorry to hear about you having problems.

2239
07:18:01,759 --> 07:18:10,330
And I'm happy that you feel better when you watch this stream.

2240
07:18:12,599 --> 07:18:13,599
That makes me feel good.

2241
07:18:15,729 --> 07:18:16,729
Thank you for the 300 bits.

2242
07:18:16,729 --> 07:18:25,349
And then Desorge Catchfoot gave 1600 bits.

2243
07:18:26,349 --> 07:18:28,349
Say gamers, are you ready for some of that free shit again?

2244
07:18:29,349 --> 07:18:30,349
Steam codes in the chat.

2245
07:18:32,229 --> 07:18:36,990
What games have you given out?

2246
07:18:37,990 --> 07:18:39,990
It took me five to six years to get my neurological illness diagnosed.

2247
07:18:40,990 --> 07:18:41,990
I just got to keep trucking.

2248
07:18:43,479 --> 07:18:44,479
Yeah, that's the idea.

2249
07:18:45,479 --> 07:18:46,479
Is just keep eliminating things until there's nothing left to eliminate.

2250
07:18:47,479 --> 07:18:48,479
And that's here you are.

2251
07:18:49,479 --> 07:18:50,479
This is what you have.

2252
07:18:51,479 --> 07:18:54,450
It just, it's frustrating because I want to just go get it done.

2253
07:18:55,450 --> 07:18:56,689
Just let's go.

2254
07:18:57,689 --> 07:18:59,439
Do it all.

2255
07:19:00,439 --> 07:19:01,939
What codes?

2256
07:19:02,939 --> 07:19:06,040
What are these for?

2257
07:19:07,040 --> 07:19:08,040
I'm seeing codes in the chat from Desorge Catchfoot.

2258
07:19:11,000 --> 07:19:14,479
What are these?

2259
07:19:15,479 --> 07:19:21,520
Bad rats?

2260
07:19:22,520 --> 07:19:23,520
They're still going.

2261
07:19:24,520 --> 07:19:28,000
There's another like three codes.

2262
07:19:29,000 --> 07:19:30,180
Is it really bad rats?

2263
07:19:31,180 --> 07:19:32,180
That's so funny.

2264
07:19:34,119 --> 07:19:35,119
Well, thank you, Desorge Catchfoot.

2265
07:19:36,119 --> 07:19:37,119
Whatever they are.

2266
07:19:38,119 --> 07:19:43,700
Thank you.

2267
07:19:44,700 --> 07:19:45,700
And thanks for the huge amount of money.

2268
07:19:46,700 --> 07:19:47,700
To me.

2269
07:19:48,700 --> 07:19:49,700
Thank you.

2270
07:19:51,700 --> 07:19:52,700
Thanks for the huge amount of money.

2271
07:19:53,700 --> 07:19:54,700
Please.

2272
07:19:55,700 --> 07:19:57,700
Please, please live close to the dumpster, that italics will be forced to live in when you abandon him.

2273
07:20:00,700 --> 07:20:01,700
The kind.

2274
07:20:02,700 --> 07:20:03,700
They are.

2275
07:20:04,700 --> 07:20:05,700
Your KFC scraps.

2276
07:20:06,700 --> 07:20:08,700
And the residual bits of poop line to allow him to sustain himself.

2277
07:20:09,700 --> 07:20:10,700
I think he's staying here.

2278
07:20:11,700 --> 07:20:17,740
I think he's staying in Vegas.

2279
07:20:18,740 --> 07:20:22,950
This was a trial period for me and Kim.

2280
07:20:23,950 --> 07:20:24,950
There's also a trial period for him too.

2281
07:20:24,950 --> 07:20:31,840
Me and Kim was also a trial period for him, too. I don't know his exact plans, but I'm pretty sure he's staying in Las Vegas

2282
07:20:38,279 --> 07:20:40,959
This is fucking so oh man

2283
07:20:41,880 --> 07:20:47,779
I'm flying you are not staying in Vegas. No, I mean Kim is staying in Vegas

2284
07:20:48,099 --> 07:20:59,770
Why did he move in with you in the first place? Well, I don't know cuz

2285
07:21:00,349 --> 07:21:03,169
We had me and Kim were just like we're moving out here

2286
07:21:03,709 --> 07:21:09,759
You gotta remember when we first came out here like it we didn't know anybody out here

2287
07:21:10,520 --> 07:21:14,500
This is I don't know anybody in this area. I mean we do now

2288
07:21:15,279 --> 07:21:20,250
But it's way easier if hey, you know, what's your situation?

2289
07:21:20,250 --> 07:21:23,169
Like you you potentially may be looking for a place to live

2290
07:21:23,169 --> 07:21:27,709
I don't know you want to fucking go do this for like a year and see what would save you like it

2291
07:21:27,709 --> 07:21:32,840
Yeah, I guess sure and now that we have had that period

2292
07:21:33,439 --> 07:21:41,680
Wait, that's it. And we we've liked it. We both parties have enjoyed it and now we're kind of just going our separate kind of

2293
07:21:42,319 --> 07:21:44,939
ways, it's

2294
07:21:45,060 --> 07:22:02,400
Weirdest do you have plans to have kids? Whoa, that's a loaded quite Wow

2295
07:22:02,919 --> 07:22:06,029
Do you have fit? Is it because you're gonna have kids?

2296
07:22:06,669 --> 07:22:08,669
Whoa

2297
07:22:09,389 --> 07:22:14,130
No

2298
07:22:14,130 --> 07:22:16,909
No

2299
07:22:16,909 --> 07:22:27,650
Answer I'm fucking answering. I just said no. I don't know what I'm doing in the future

2300
07:22:27,650 --> 07:22:30,150
I don't know what I'm doing next week guys. You think I know what I'm doing?

2301
07:22:30,150 --> 07:22:34,619
I don't know what could be in the cards in the fucking future

2302
07:22:35,099 --> 07:22:36,819
I'm gonna stop answering these questions

2303
07:22:36,819 --> 07:22:42,259
I'm gonna stop answering the questions because the more that I answered the dot that the deeper the sinkhole gets

2304
07:22:42,740 --> 07:22:49,619
Let's go. Let's throw the subs. I don't know fucking camera, right? Okay, good. I'm naked

2305
07:22:49,619 --> 07:22:57,409
I don't know I'm not not in the plants. No plants

2306
07:22:57,409 --> 07:23:02,250
I know I'm turning like 35 this year and I'm getting a little older and it's at that point where

2307
07:23:02,650 --> 07:23:08,549
You sort of need to decide in the next little while if it's something that you want to do because

2308
07:23:08,990 --> 07:23:11,990
Yes, it's like the time to do it and for the most part

2309
07:23:12,549 --> 07:23:17,990
Okay, sure. And what no, it's not in the plans at the moment and I'm yes

2310
07:23:17,990 --> 07:23:22,909
I'm moving around a lot, but you don't I could you tell that this is not part of the plan. Okay, cool

2311
07:23:23,669 --> 07:23:41,659
Let's show the crap. These are all the subs today a lot of them stop tagging. Don't tag Kim

2312
07:23:41,900 --> 07:23:45,540
There's nothing to do with this conversation. She's not just you know, it's gonna say the same damn thing

2313
07:23:45,819 --> 07:23:49,659
It's gonna say no, there's no plans at all zero. No, we're not doing that

2314
07:23:49,659 --> 07:23:51,659
I know and that's exactly what she would say

2315
07:23:51,860 --> 07:23:54,540
Hey, this is a lot of subs tonight. Holy fuck. Thank you guys

2316
07:23:55,259 --> 07:24:01,069
Thanks for the massive amount of subs every stream

2317
07:24:01,830 --> 07:24:09,700
Happens every fucking day. Thank you. Hey, uh Dran Cree. Thanks for the 1500 bits

2318
07:24:09,700 --> 07:24:15,069
Hey longtime fans since 2013 first time giving bits ever. Thanks for the it's a lot

2319
07:24:15,630 --> 07:24:17,630
15 bucks is a lot

2320
07:24:17,750 --> 07:24:21,110
Just want to say that I really appreciate you especially in the difficult time

2321
07:24:21,509 --> 07:24:25,310
I've been cooped up in self isolation for about a week due to contact fears

2322
07:24:25,830 --> 07:24:31,669
And recently developed a cough. I'm going a little stir crazy and your streams have been such a great thing to look forward to and all

2323
07:24:31,669 --> 07:24:33,669
Of this you do great work

2324
07:24:33,830 --> 07:24:41,700
Thank you for the $15 again. I will tell you though

2325
07:24:45,099 --> 07:24:50,590
Self-isolating that's the that's the right thing to do. You're doing the right thing. You're doing all the right things

2326
07:24:51,150 --> 07:25:06,479
Just hang in there hang in there. Hopefully this all will be over soon

2327
07:25:07,040 --> 07:25:09,470
Hopefully we don't have to worry about

2328
07:25:09,470 --> 07:25:14,080
Getting this illness or spreading it around or something, but you're doing the right thing

2329
07:25:14,919 --> 07:25:19,729
Yeah, it's the right thing but isolation fucking sucks

2330
07:25:20,549 --> 07:25:28,090
Yeah, I know. I know I know I know we are we are humans we are meant to

2331
07:25:28,930 --> 07:25:31,970
talk and converse and socialize and

2332
07:25:32,810 --> 07:25:44,099
We're meant to do that. I know that's why hopefully this doesn't last that long. We're meant to pog

2333
07:25:46,009 --> 07:25:51,849
Yes, that too, I appreciate the 1500 bits though

2334
07:25:52,689 --> 07:26:00,209
J-rin, thanks a lot. You're doing the right thing

2335
07:26:04,509 --> 07:26:14,810
Morning may bone by the way, I wish you I wish that I wish you the best of health by the way morning maple

2336
07:26:14,810 --> 07:26:16,810
Thanks for the thousand bits

2337
07:26:16,810 --> 07:26:20,130
German thanks for doing what you do. It means a lot. This is related to the stream whatsoever

2338
07:26:20,650 --> 07:26:32,799
But I remember there was this British French kids show in the early 90s called Harry Jeremy. Here's the intro Harry Jeremy

2339
07:26:42,180 --> 07:26:48,419
Superhero doesn't drive a car stop motion

2340
07:26:53,909 --> 07:27:00,349
And I've never seen no secret hideaway and no all-seeing eyes just Harry

2341
07:27:01,750 --> 07:27:04,229
He's most definitely say the name

2342
07:27:05,270 --> 07:27:07,790
His name is Jeremy and he's Harry

2343
07:27:10,310 --> 07:27:17,330
Okay, if I was still doing sub sounds it would be this his name is Jeremy and he's Harry hey

2344
07:27:17,369 --> 07:27:20,169
Thanks a lot for the the sub there, dude. I appreciate it

2345
07:27:21,889 --> 07:27:26,369
Hey, thanks a lot of Mike three for the sub appreciate that two months in a row

2346
07:27:29,860 --> 07:27:31,860
Hey look at that we get another sub from

2347
07:27:32,459 --> 07:27:41,610
That's a sub so that's a sub sound, but I don't do this anymore. Thank you morning maple for the thousand bits

2348
07:27:41,610 --> 07:27:46,130
Thank you, sir enigma for the four dollars. Thanks for making us laugh and Karen during this shitty time

2349
07:27:46,770 --> 07:27:52,599
Helps take my mind off the world me too, so it works both ways

2350
07:27:53,200 --> 07:28:00,599
Sitting here having a good time takes my mind off this shit as well. So it's good. Thanks for the 400 bits

2351
07:28:02,419 --> 07:28:07,139
Internet internet Jorge or internet George. Thanks for the five dollars, Jeremiah

2352
07:28:07,139 --> 07:28:09,680
I wish the best for you and everyone in chat this trying time

2353
07:28:09,680 --> 07:28:13,599
It's important to remember our humanity and compassion for each other as long as we are

2354
07:28:14,360 --> 07:28:22,229
Compassionate and care for each other we can overcome this. Love you all. It's very true. Very very true

2355
07:28:22,229 --> 07:28:34,740
Just be diligent be aware and take it seriously pretty much all we can do

2356
07:28:37,529 --> 07:28:42,409
Silence Serenity. Thanks for 250. Hey Jeremy, can I ask you something? That's kind of been bothering me lately, okay

2357
07:28:42,610 --> 07:28:47,169
How did you find your calling in life? I'm in my mid 20s. And even though I'm moderately successful

2358
07:28:47,169 --> 07:28:53,419
I have no idea what my life goals are. How did I how did I find my calling? Um

2359
07:28:54,810 --> 07:29:00,840
To be honest, I've kind of just been doing this kind of shit my whole life

2360
07:29:02,479 --> 07:29:08,819
nothing made me happier in my entire life and just sitting around and

2361
07:29:10,479 --> 07:29:17,330
Telling fucking jokes making up scenarios playing video games and hanging out and just talking shit with my friends

2362
07:29:17,330 --> 07:29:24,389
I loved it more than anything and doing this kind of stuff

2363
07:29:24,430 --> 07:29:31,970
What you are witnessing right now when I turn these streams on is the exact same kind of shit that I used to do

2364
07:29:31,970 --> 07:29:37,669
When I was 15 16 all the way through my mid to late all the way into my mid 20s

2365
07:29:37,790 --> 07:29:42,639
Just with people sitting around on a couch. We would do the same fucking thing

2366
07:29:42,759 --> 07:29:54,669
So, I don't know if the calling is the right word, but I've always just had this I just I just love

2367
07:29:54,669 --> 07:29:56,830
I don't I don't even know if calling is the right word

2368
07:29:56,830 --> 07:30:03,540
I just love sitting around and just like shooting the shit is all as I love it

2369
07:30:03,540 --> 07:30:12,939
I love it more than anything. Did you and your friends ever say pog? Well funny story

2370
07:30:14,180 --> 07:30:21,400
You want to know where the inspiration for German rumble came from is exactly what I'm talking about. We used

2371
07:30:22,119 --> 07:30:25,150
we used to in

2372
07:30:25,150 --> 07:30:28,020
no mercy for

2373
07:30:29,180 --> 07:30:33,750
Nintendo 64 friends of mine would sit around and we would make characters and

2374
07:30:34,799 --> 07:30:36,240
It's gonna sound crazy

2375
07:30:36,240 --> 07:30:45,130
But we would all make our dads and just sit there and let the CPU dads fight it out

2376
07:30:49,419 --> 07:30:52,439
It was like if it was like we had so much fun

2377
07:30:52,580 --> 07:30:59,299
It was so so much fun and that's kind of like I told you that's what it just I've been doing it for so long

2378
07:30:59,299 --> 07:31:06,490
I've been we've been the same thing we do here. Yeah, all of our actual

2379
07:31:06,490 --> 07:31:09,810
Actual like CPU just our actual dads

2380
07:31:10,049 --> 07:31:21,869
we would make them all and they would all fight in like an elimination match and like when you're like dad got eliminated first it

2381
07:31:21,869 --> 07:31:26,169
Was like no, come on. What the fuck? Oh, come on, dad

2382
07:31:29,830 --> 07:31:38,400
Come on you'll be in next time that was just one of the many games we would play many many many games

2383
07:31:38,400 --> 07:31:44,360
We would play so long-winded. Where does the where do you get your calling?

2384
07:31:44,959 --> 07:31:49,720
It's just the thing that you the thing that you have the most fun doing the thing that you care the most about

2385
07:31:49,880 --> 07:31:59,729
The best fun in games is the fun you make yourself

2386
07:32:00,650 --> 07:32:02,650
Yes, that is absolutely

2387
07:32:03,529 --> 07:32:14,689
100 fucking percent accurate and not even to see not not just video games in general just the fun you make yourself is

2388
07:32:16,450 --> 07:32:21,799
The fun that you create is more fun than anything that anyone can ever make for you. Let's just put it that way

2389
07:32:22,319 --> 07:32:35,810
Hopefully somewhere in there. You got some kind of an answer, but thank you on

2390
07:32:38,490 --> 07:32:45,549
Zeroic thanks for the 300 bits. When's it? Oh, I gotta answer this first. When's German Rumble charity it got moved

2391
07:32:46,310 --> 07:32:52,430
Because the Boston Marathon got moved the Boston Marathon is on I think indefinite

2392
07:32:52,669 --> 07:32:58,689
hiatus until they know exactly when they want to do it the whole purpose of the German Rumble charity stream was to

2393
07:32:59,250 --> 07:33:05,759
Directly benefit the sponsoring of one of my friends running the marathon in September. Okay

2394
07:33:05,759 --> 07:33:09,619
Yeah, and that's so unfortunate that we have to you know

2395
07:33:10,340 --> 07:33:12,979
all the marathon runners all the charities is

2396
07:33:13,779 --> 07:33:24,459
We have to wait, but that's the plan still it is going to benefit the charity and sponsor his run

2397
07:33:24,659 --> 07:33:33,849
I'm gonna play Banner Lord when it comes out in a few days. Probably not you'll probably not see me play Banner Lord

2398
07:33:34,369 --> 07:33:39,409
Judging by how much I did not really do very well in the first one

2399
07:33:39,409 --> 07:33:52,220
