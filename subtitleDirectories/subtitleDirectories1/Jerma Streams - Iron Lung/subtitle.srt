1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,810
Hey, how are you? Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Listen, I don't know what it is about my body.

2
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:18,809
I don't know why my body does this or why it's like this. Well, I mean, I think I could take a guess.

3
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:28,629
At like 358 almost every day, I have to go to the bathroom. It's something the way that like my,

4
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:37,750
my pipes are in my body. It's just like, all right, okay. 355. Let's go. 356. Okay. 357. I gotta go.

5
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:44,100
It happens every day. I, you know what I have to start doing? I have to start just make, I've got

6
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:53,420
to start eating an hour earlier. At least. Yes, I, yeah, hold on. I know. My microphone is changed.

7
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:02,390
I, I'm, well, we're gonna work on it in a minute. My microphone, I fucked with a bunch of settings.

8
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,290
So I'm trying to figure out what, how, how, how fucked up it is. I'm, it's, I'm peaking.

9
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:25,879
You sound like the Joker. Sounds fun. How does it sound? It's really loud. Yeah. I mean, I,

10
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:33,450
I've taken the criticism. I turned myself way up and I, I made sure that I was loud as fuck now.

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:45,370
You know what I'm saying? He, he went from being way too quiet to really fucking loud.

12
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,189
Does it sound all right? We go, should I drop it a little bit? Because I have,

13
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:57,989
let me see what happens if I do this. I sound, I'm louder. Let, let me know if this is a better

14
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:09,580
place. Is this better? Dropping the gain a little bit. How does it sound? Better? Is it fine? You

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:20,500
sound like you're canned. I'm canned. Well, you know what I think I want to do one of these days,

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,139
maybe even today, I don't know, is just do, do a stream where I sit there and just mess with

17
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,819
settings until you guys give me all thumbs up emotes. And I have another dead pixel on this

18
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:44,439
monitor and it's really not making me happy. I'll tell you. What do the mods say? Do I, okay,

19
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:55,590
let me ask you this. Do I sound better or worse than I did two days ago? Better or worse than

20
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:02,580
two days ago? Better with question marks. Okay. I need to test this too, because I need to make

21
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,939
sure I'm not going to hurt anybody. If I like do like the patent to German on eight, five,

22
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,580
yell at the thing on screen. I'm going to yell and I want to see if the compressor catches it.

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,139
Cause I'm, I need to make sure that happens. Cause I don't want to hurt anybody's ears.

24
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:17,300
So turn me down a little bit and let's, let's test this to see how bad this sounds.

25
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,659
Okay. You ready? I'm going to make a loud sound. Just I want to, I'm warning you all right now.

26
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:40,219
What the, what is that? What is that guy? Oh, wow. Oh my God. He just killed me bad. Are we okay?

27
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:50,340
Did it, did it catch it? Did it not? It was all right. That's not all right. Cool. Yeah.

28
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,900
Cause when you mess with a compressor like this, or you mess with audio settings, if I yell and

29
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,560
the compressor doesn't catch it, it's actually going to be bad and it'll be really way too loud

30
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,020
and just fuck up everything. So, all right. All right. All right. Let's go. All right.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,650
So his plan is we're doing today. Today, today we're going to be doing iron lung,

32
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,779
which people have been saying, you got to do that. You got to play it. I believe this is by the

33
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:32,730
dusk devs or dusk dev. So it's, but it's only an hour long. This is only like maybe an hour to two

34
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:40,500
hours long total. I loved dusk. I thought dusk was one of my, I, you know what, thinking back to dusk,

35
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,649
that's, I would put that probably high up on some of my favorite games I played on stream.

36
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:53,209
That game was so much fun. It was great. It was unbelievable. So, I mean, obviously if the person

37
00:04:53,209 --> 00:05:02,490
that made dusk or the group that made dusk, I want to play their other game, but it's only going to

38
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:09,319
be like an hour or so. This game is not like dusk. Oh no, I know, I know. I know. I know it's a scary,

39
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,319
scary game. I know it's very scary. There's going to be a face cam. Well, okay. Look at the streamer.

40
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:21,370
He got really scared. So we'll do kind of like a scary game thing today. Then after that,

41
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:29,300
we're going to play Glover for the N64. They ported it to Steam and here we go again.

42
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,370
Glover was ported to Steam and it was voted on by pre-stream chat. So that's what we're going to do.

43
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:49,060
And then if Glover sucks, and I gotta tell you, Glove buddies, the same rules are going to apply

44
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,899
for Glover when I kind of, I mean, maybe, we'll see. If I love the game and I think it's like the

45
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,220
most fun I've ever had, I'm going to keep playing it. But after an hour or two in Glover, the

46
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,019
strawberry magic rules are going to apply and we're going to have to see how powerful the Glove buddies

47
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:20,550
are. You are sus. Yes. Okay, first thing is first. Wits play Iron Lung, right? Because that's what

48
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,959
we're doing. What about eating a glove? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Let me address that.

49
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,939
All right. Let me address it. I'll address it. Just give me a second. I gotta tweet this. I'll

50
00:06:31,939 --> 00:07:33,019
address it in a second. Be right back. Okay. So a couple of years ago, I made a comment saying,

51
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,149
maybe embarrassingly, that the three Stooges were going to be added to Fortnite by April 24th,

52
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:51,379
2022. And I mean, that was probably back in like 2019 or so. And I said I would bet anything.

53
00:07:52,019 --> 00:08:02,839
And what I bet was, I bet that I would eat a glove on stream if they weren't in the game by

54
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:16,360
tomorrow. So, so we'll see. We'll see what happens. Well, we'll see. We'll see. You know,

55
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,449
we'll see what happens. They could, they could get added tomorrow. It's possible. We'll see.

56
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,159
So if they're not added, and look, it's probably like a licensing issue, right? They probably

57
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:42,970
were going to. It's a licensing problem, without a doubt. So I'm sure they tried to add the three

58
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,850
Stooges, but paramount pictures or whatever. Probably whoever owns three Stooges were like,

59
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,769
nah, we want to live with whatever the whatever the drama behind the scenes was to make it so

60
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:57,690
they weren't in the game. I don't know. But I'm gonna have to eat a glove eventually here.

61
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,559
All right. I'm gonna play around with some audio settings. You guys let me know how it sounds.

62
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:15,159
You ready? Let's do a couple of tests. You ready? Here we go. Here's the first test. Hi, guys.

63
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:25,659
This is German. Hold on. Hey, guys. It's me, German985. Coming to you from my studio.

64
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:32,519
And I'm ready to say hi. I'm ready to say what's going on. Ready to check in on how everybody's

65
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:46,279
doing. How are we? Are we good? How are we? Is it better than it just was in his studio?

66
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:55,639
Is that actually better? The mic is too hot. All right. So how about, how about now? How's

67
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,960
everybody doing? It's me, German985 here coming at you from my studio. Want to check in on how

68
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,980
everybody's doing? Want to see how crispy this sounds? How crunchy it might sound?

69
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,289
It's a podcast. Wait, good? You guys can't say good to everything. These are too bassy. All right.

70
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on. How about, how does this sound? Hey, guys. It's me, German. Coming at you here from

71
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:35,539
my studio. Just checking to see how crunchy and crunchy this sounds. If we've got some opinions

72
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:43,990
on how I sound, I would love to hear them. They sound the same. Test with a wheeze laugh. Okay.

73
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:59,580
Better? First one was better? Sounds like you're very ugly. Oh, dude, I don't know about this one.

74
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:09,960
You sound really ugly. The first one was, okay, wait. How about now? How about now? Hi, guys.

75
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:20,500
How's everybody doing? We having a good time here? We have, we chilling? This is shit now. Okay. How

76
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,330
about this? Hey, guys. How are we doing now? We chilling? Having a good time? Everybody having

77
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:36,570
a relaxing evening? I'm seeing a lot of betters. I'm seeing a lot of betters. Let me see what this

78
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,730
sounds like. Hey, how does it sound? Hey, guys. How are you doing? Oh, fuck. This actually sounds

79
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:47,460
like shit. Hold on. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hey,

80
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:55,929
guys. Hey, everybody. How's everybody doing? My name is German at eight five. Hi, everybody. How

81
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:02,230
you doing? My name is German. I know this is so fucked up. Look, you can make changes. You can

82
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:09,210
change how you sound. It's so like, look at this. This is ridiculous. Okay. I actually think this

83
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,100
one might be the best one. If everyone wants to disagree, they can. I think this actually

84
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:22,919
might be pretty good. Are we in agreement that this one sounds better? To me, this one sounds

85
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:31,620
fine. This one sounds okay. Yeah, I think this is fine for now. I'll figure it out. You're a bad

86
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:41,210
audio quality streamer. He's trolling. No, I'm not. I'm scrolling on shit. I think this actually

87
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,289
sounds fine. Can I get a confirmation from the mods and the sounds fucking pog before I go?

88
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:52,039
It's still a little compressed. How about actually this actually sounds better. Oh, yeah. I think I

89
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,379
got it. Bingo. Got it right now. This is it. This is the one. This is absolutely the one right here.

90
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,220
Yep. It sure is. All right. Let me turn it up. There we go. Guys, I got it. I think I got this

91
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,899
the one. This is the one right here. This is the one. This is the one. Nobody move. I got it. This

92
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:22,870
is the one. Yep. I got it. This is good. Let's fucking go. I'm ready. Audio is so fucking hard

93
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,429
to work with. It really is like fuck audio. You know what I mean? You know, the worst thing I ever

94
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,509
did was I get like a fucking real microphone. I should just have a thing taped to my mouth.

95
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:44,250
The whole, who cares? You guys ready? Let's go. The biggest mistake you can ever make as a streamer

96
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,610
is like, Oh, I got to have like a professional microphone and I've got to have a setup where it

97
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,649
goes into a compressor and then it goes with the compressor into the computer. And then I go into

98
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,529
my audio settings or JG equalizer. No, just give me a tape fucking microphone in my mouth and who

99
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:03,240
cares? And now, now you can hear when I move. I fucked up. God damn it. Do I have the other

100
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,139
profile that I had saved? Of course not. Shit. Oh, I fucked it up. I fucked it up so bad.

101
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:23,559
All right. Hold on. Yep. Got it. All right. Let's go. Fucking shitty audio, Andy, whatever.

102
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,320
Boy, what do you see? You got to have a professional setup.

103
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:52,230
How are you doing? You're doing good. Let's play iron lung. This is loud. DJ Andy. This is really

104
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,269
fucking loud. All right. Is this like, is this getting, is this game going to scream at me?

105
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:12,539
Is this a screamer or am I fine? Lights off. It's, it's like four o'clock in the afternoon guys,

106
00:15:12,539 --> 00:16:10,809
but it's not going to do anything. Maybe later. There you go. I just made a mess. No, I didn't.

107
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:20,409
I'm fine. It's just soap. That's all it is. Oh, it's on my hand. All right. So there you go.

108
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:27,059
I ate a glove on stream. What was I doing? I don't even know what I was just doing. What was I just

109
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:34,860
doing? What was I just doing right now? Somebody help me. Turning the lights off. Right. Okay.

110
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:50,980
They're already off. The lights are already off. They're not on. The lights are already off.

111
00:16:50,980 --> 00:17:01,110
Are we ready? Okay. I know stalling, stalling, stalling. My microphone sounds like stupid.

112
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:08,950
I'm sorry. I thought I was fixing things and I just made it worse. All right. You guys ready?

113
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:33,099
Let's go. New game. That was huge. I'm ready. Let's go. Decades ago, every known star and

114
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,869
habitable planet vanished, leaving only those who were on space stations or starships. This event

115
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:45,140
became known as the Quiet Rapture. With supplies dwindling and infrastructure crumbling, survivors

116
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,470
are searching for any trace of natural resources in a universe of barren moons lit by the ghost

117
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:58,890
light of vanished stars. One such moon holds a strange anomaly, an ocean of blood. You are a

118
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,170
convict tasked with exploring this anomaly in a makeshift submarine nicknamed the Iron Lung.

119
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,490
It was not designed for this depth, so you will be welded inside and the forward window will be

120
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:20,309
closed. There was no time for training. If successful, you earn your freedom. So every

121
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:34,660
planet disappeared and got destroyed. Drink the bubble mix. You just coming up with all kinds of

122
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:43,779
stupid shit, aren't you? Like for me to do. Why would anybody do that? That's not happening.

123
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:48,890
Don't do that. Why would you? Why would anybody do that? Don't be like, take care of your bodies.

124
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,039
Don't drink fucking like shit that can hurt you. All right. So let me get like a, let me get a

125
00:18:54,039 --> 00:19:01,240
TLDR here. I was like fucked up voice. Andy's is still reigning supreme here. So I'm a convict.

126
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:29,109
Everybody, every all life died and we like got stuck on a space station. You got it. I got a

127
00:19:29,109 --> 00:20:06,279
better mic than I do. Roger, can you repeat that please? View ASD is move, interact, tabs and map.

128
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:18,200
Whoa. Briefing. Two weeks ago, we conducted an exploration of moon 85 for the first time since

129
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,750
the quiet rapture leading to the discovery of a fourth blood ocean. Trench beneath the ocean

130
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,059
surface has several points of interest. Your task is to photograph these points of interest

131
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:34,569
with the SM 13 forward camera. Photos must be taken within two units of the specified position

132
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:39,750
and 10 degrees of the specified angle. You can also use the camera to help with navigation.

133
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,500
Only photos taken at the specified points of interest will be saved. Since you can't navigate

134
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,640
by site, pay attention to your coordinates and consult the map. Proximity indicators next to

135
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:59,289
the sub controls will trigger if you're getting close to an obstacle. If they laugh, this guy

136
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:18,150
wanted to ban geometry in classrooms. Am I going to need some help? All right. So I have to go take

137
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:35,940
pictures of this stuff and I have this forward facing camera. What does, what does this do?

138
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,670
Can I open the, how do I take, can I, can I look at it, look through something? All right. So this

139
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:54,279
is, what, what, what, what was it? What was it? Okay. Points of interest. Okay. So X 325,

140
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:08,329
Y 741, X 325. Dude, I actually like can't see cause it's too bright in this room. I should've

141
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,730
played this like in two hours. I'm, I'm playing this game at the absolute worst possible time

142
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,809
because the sun is like, it's like four o'clock in the afternoon where the sun is like at its

143
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:33,539
fucking apex. Okay. That's a, there's so much glare on my screen. What was that? How do I change X?

144
00:22:34,950 --> 00:23:05,799
All right. What was it? It was, I'll go here first. X 180, Y 576. Can I look out the window?

145
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:24,519
I'm in a submarine. Yeah. Do I know where I, okay. Hover over Y five, A 184. Where's A?

146
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:48,859
Is this A? Oh no. I'm going south. Okay. How do I change X? I'm in a submarine. Yeah. Yeah. I know.

147
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:59,289
But how do I like, oh shit. This is not an expedition. It's, it's an execution. When they

148
00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:04,230
put you in here, they don't want you to return. And even if you do, and even if they keep their

149
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:11,079
promises, what freedom waits for you? A few dying ships in a sea of dead stars. How do I take a

150
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:18,599
picture? If there's still hope, it lies beyond the veil. Hoping this void is as illusionary as the

151
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:24,519
walls and dark souls and demon souls and dark souls three and Sekiro as the starlight. I will

152
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,000
choose to breathe my last here at the bottom of the ocean, unseen, unheard and uncontrolled. They

153
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,630
will get their execution. I will get my freedom. Oh, these are the buttons over here. What's this?

154
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:48,250
Ooh, this is the, okay. This is where I am. I just took this picture, right? We've got an,

155
00:24:48,250 --> 00:25:07,029
we've got an anomaly. How do I move? Oh, okay. I get it. All right. So now what's,

156
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:13,339
what's like close to me right here? I need Y, I need something X in like the hundreds, right?

157
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:23,220
Am I close to anything? All right. I'm, I'm going to go for, so, okay, help me. We're talking about

158
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:37,210
an axis here. So like X, Y, right? Yes. Yeah. So like, um, when I'm talking about the X axis,

159
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,900
that I'm talking about like left and right, and then Y up and down. They should fucking remove

160
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,839
geometry from school. Teach people how to do their taxes. Not like what that line and that

161
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:56,170
line does. Okay. So I want 180X, which is pretty much there. Let's go a little bit further back

162
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:20,470
here. 180. So 180X is here. So I don't know where, where am I in Y? 178. So I'm like right here.

163
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:32,230
178. So I'm like down here. Oh, okay. So I'm like right here. So if I go to the right,

164
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:43,210
so I need 186 for 22. What am I high? What, what? I don't get it. This is X and Y, right? Isn't this

165
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:53,220
like where I am right now? Wait, what are you talking about? The numbers. Yeah, this is X,

166
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:07,289
right? X1. This is where I am right now. X180Y178. X180Y178. So I'm like right here. I'm like right

167
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:16,730
here. What are you talking about? Yeah, I'm reading this correctly. I gotta stop doing that

168
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:25,019
because people like, I look at the asshole. How many times have I like done the like, I'm like

169
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:32,779
coming into the camera. Like I'm going into the camera. Okay. So I just have to go this way. So

170
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:47,430
let's go that way. So I need to stay at 180. So if I'm here, I need to go like this. So I need X322

171
00:27:47,430 --> 00:28:13,910
and I'll adjust it. What, what, what, what? What's wrong? Is that a wall? Oh shit. Um,

172
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:25,900
so I'm at X200Y. So is this, okay. Is the dark solid? This is, is this like a solid wall? Is this,

173
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:36,230
this dark area? No. Okay. So I just have to like turn. Okay. So what if I take a picture here? Is

174
00:28:36,230 --> 00:29:18,059
it safe to go that way? I think so. Okay. We're good. X322. What was that? I'm not going to hit

175
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:51,589
that wall. Okay. We're good. Put the curtains down. Curtains. X322Y186. What is A? What's A?

176
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:14,500
Angle. So this is angle. Okay. Fine. All right. Almost there. X322Y186. I'm almost at 322. So I

177
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:35,000
gotta start going 322. Almost there. All right. 133. Angle 33. What the fuck are you talking about?

178
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:55,640
322. 183. Put the curtain. I can't do the curtains. 186. I'm pretty much there. I'm gonna change the

179
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:35,019
angle. 33. 322. 186. What's that? I found something. What's that thing? I gotta go down a little more,

180
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:53,910
I think. 322. I'm not quite there. Okay. No, no, no. Other way. Other way. Other 322. I gotta go

181
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:16,470
this way. 322. And then I have to go up. 322. 186. So I have to go up or down. I don't know. You don't

182
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:58,740
have to be perfect. Oh, okay. I'm almost there. 186, right? 33. The rock. Do I just go forward?

183
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:11,019
Oh, I got it. That was it? Oh, shit. All right. That was good. So we're gonna go from here to here.

184
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:17,539
So I got the picture, right? Do I have to print this? Or does it, does this count? Like, do I have

185
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:29,130
to print this out? No. Okay. All right. Counts. All right. So now I'm gonna go 378. 263. I think

186
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:42,440
I can just do this. Wait, am I gonna crash into the rocks? Oh my god. Okay. I need to turn. Just

187
00:33:42,440 --> 00:34:32,949
move out of the way. 378. 263. 378. 263. Game saved. That means something happened. I'm almost

188
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:51,690
there. All right. Let's go up a little higher. 263. All right. All right. All right. 363. Let's

189
00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:27,929
go more to the right here. 378. Angle 50. So what's here? Got another rock formation? Yep. Okay.

190
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:44,119
Anything here I need to see? Make sure I get a closer look. There's like a slug there. Okay. I

191
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:53,219
got it. So how, where, so I, should I, okay, I'm thinking head up this way and wrap around

192
00:35:53,219 --> 00:36:05,559
and end like down here. Or go this way and wrap around and end here. I wonder. I think I'm gonna

193
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:18,949
go up this way. This way seems like a good route. Or this is, what's closer? Okay. This is 259. 406.

194
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:43,880
So I gotta go up. Yeah. 406. We gotta go up high. Hey, it's all right. No, I'm not near it. 406. Stop,

195
00:36:43,880 --> 00:37:02,780
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What is it? What's wrong? All right. It's just a

196
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:34,730
brush. It's just a little bit of brush. 406. I gotta be careful. I gotta change this to 259. So

197
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:45,289
I gotta go 304. So I gotta go left a little bit. Hang a left. Wait, why is that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

198
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:57,769
That's a wall, dude. I mean, it's, it was, it was like, what does that mean? How do I increase

199
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:18,340
oxygen? Okay. Fuck. What's that? I'm not gonna, whoa. Oh my goodness. Okay. Wait. Turn, turn,

200
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:46,820
turn, turn, turn. Okay. Can I go around? How do I get oxygen? I'm almost at the right height here.

201
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:58,980
Okay. That's fine. 406. So I'm like, where am I? 2378. So I'm here. I need to just go left now,

202
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:20,099
but I have to wrap around. Oh damn. Where am I? I'm like in a cavern. Can I go this way? Am I

203
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:27,030
gonna hit this? How, how close do I have to be to hit something? All right. Pull it back a little.

204
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:43,659
Turn your lights off. I can't. Yeah. I gotta, there's something in the way here. I gotta go

205
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:58,630
all the way around it. What number I'm looking for? Looking for 259. God damn. That's far. And

206
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:14,199
then I'll have to go down. All right. And then I'm going to wrap around and go down. It's scary.

207
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:32,760
Okay. Um, should I go? I'm gonna have to go this way still. Oh, fuck. Can I make it through this?

208
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:38,250
Can I make it through this? If I just like sneak through, can I make it through that?

209
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:58,619
That's a wall. Is it a wall? Like a full wall? Shit. It's a big wall. How do I get around this?

210
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:17,659
Fuck. How do I approach this? Use the map. But I thought you guys said that the dark outline

211
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:31,340
didn't mean anything. I asked. I said, are these walls? And everyone said, no, the white is the

212
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,179
walls. Oh, I asked if this was important. I thought this was just like a, like pools or something. I'm

213
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:43,269
inside of this area. All right. I thought this was like, like a interesting looking map. All right.

214
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:47,110
I get it. All right. But I asked like, are these walls? Is this like solid? And everyone was like,

215
00:41:47,110 --> 00:42:00,119
no, no, no. I asked if these were walls. It was the reverse. The pools is the ocean. How am I

216
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,019
supposed to get here then? Why did you guys tell me to go this way? I can't even go up here. This

217
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:15,780
is blocked off. All right. Okay. All right. Let's fucking go. So right now a 312, 457, 312, 457.

218
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:27,820
I'm like here, here, 457. All right. So I'm like looking at this wall right here. So if I go all

219
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:38,260
the way left and pull it this way, I should be all right, right? If I go like this, this should be

220
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:54,809
okay. Dude, the shit got real thin. All right. Here we go. You guys confused me. I thought you

221
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:10,659
all right. I had from the very beginning. All right. I'm close now. 259, 406. So I need to kind

222
00:43:10,659 --> 00:44:06,340
of pull it up this way a little. There's something like, what the fuck is going on? What is this?

223
00:44:06,340 --> 00:45:23,099
What's the angle? 296. What is that? What the fuck is that? Oh, did I not get a picture of it?

224
00:45:23,099 --> 00:46:03,940
406. Do I have to get closer? Oh, angle 259. Okay. But it's 259 to angle 296. Oh fuck. I'm mixing

225
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:14,969
them up. I have to go this way though backwards. I navigation is like, I don't fucking do it. Like

226
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:22,949
I can't like plot land and shit. Like I give me a fucking dodge roll and I'll beat ever again.

227
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:57,000
259. All right. This is close enough. So now I need 296. All right. So what is that? Oh shit.

228
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:10,469
I have to navigate out of here. It's the worm. Okay. So now I got to go. If I keep going down

229
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:18,599
and wrap around, I'll get there because I don't, can I, can I get up here this way?

230
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:27,690
I wonder if I can go up there or should I try to just go? I have to go this way. Maybe I can.

231
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:50,980
I'll try because I'm like right here. Is there like a disconnection on the map? No, I can't.

232
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,699
All right. I can't. All right. All right. So I'm going to turn around and go down

233
00:47:53,699 --> 00:48:16,889
because I'm like right here. I'm just going to go straight down. Use the third dimension.

234
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:24,260
That sounds like something they said in like 1995 or like 1996 or like a man, like a character.

235
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,619
So like you use the third dimension and it's like, oh, they turn into like

236
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:40,630
3d like Homer Simpson did. Okay. So I'm at two 56, 377. I'm three 70. I'm like here.

237
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:56,969
So I got to pull it to the right a little head this way. Uh huh. I know. I know. I'm like right

238
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:21,260
on the edge here. All right. Two, two 80, three 38, two 80, three 38. I'm like right here. So I

239
00:49:21,260 --> 00:50:01,559
got to keep going down to the right. Okay. Nothing. Are you real? A CG character can't do that. Okay.

240
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:07,829
We're not at CG technology where, where like they can do this and it looks like that CG doesn't look

241
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:15,019
like that. See like skin. They don't have the technology to do skin yet. No, they don't like

242
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:22,099
hair. No, that's real hair. CG hair. It looks fucking ridiculous. All CG hair looks like the

243
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:42,059
person's underwater moving around. Sorry. I'm real. Look at this. CG can't do that yet. This

244
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:50,940
guy's jiggle physics are insane. You can't be real. You don't understand basic geometry.

245
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:59,480
I don't know how many times I have to say this. When you, okay, when you're in your thirties,

246
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,960
I would like for you to guys to remember what you did in high school. I have not.

247
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,820
Okay. When you, when you're out of like high school, you're out of college, you've been out

248
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:15,480
of a classroom for like fucking 15 years. There is no, there was no thing that I am ever doing

249
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:23,269
in my life that needs me to plot X and Y ever for any fucking reason ever. It's not like, oh,

250
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:29,139
hey, man, what are you doing today? Well, you know, plotting X, Y and angles. No, I'm cooking.

251
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:36,550
I'm doing my taxes. I'm doing fucking chores. I'm sleeping on the couch. You know what I mean?

252
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:46,300
It's there's no, there's no reason why I would ever do this. It's been like 20 years and you're,

253
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:53,380
you, I can't tell you the hard drive starts to fill in other shit and like geometry too is you

254
00:51:53,380 --> 00:52:00,840
keep moving and it gets lost. The hard drive writes over it. When you're 30 fucking five, you, whoa.

255
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,079
When you are 35, you tell me how you do, but yeah, I got it. I could plot the fucking right

256
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:18,329
angle of a fucking acute triangle. No, you won't. No, you got more important shit to worry about.

257
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:36,440
Like, you know, like how long the grass is outside and like, is there a hummingbird that you saw?

258
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,550
And what's, what's the early bird special at the breakfast place? When I go to the early bird

259
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:46,389
special, the breakfast place, the, the waiter or waitress doesn't come over and give me a worksheet

260
00:52:46,389 --> 00:52:50,789
and say, Hey, can you solve for X? No, they go, here you go, sir. Here's two sunny side up eggs.

261
00:52:50,789 --> 00:53:04,659
Okay. Where am I? Three, six, three, two, eight, four, three, six, three, two, eight, four. I'm like

262
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:22,730
here. He's 63. All right. I gotta go up a little. Okay. Ooh, easy. Where am I? Three, seven, six,

263
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:32,219
two, nine, two, three, seven, six, two, nine, two. All right. I'm like right here. So I gotta

264
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:54,840
go up a little more. I'm not going to hit this. Right. Three, eight, six, three, 14, three, eight,

265
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:09,079
six, three, 14. Okay. I think I can just go up a little and then write a lot of people's jobs

266
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:32,260
involve geometry. So do the geometry job. Are you mad at me? What just happened? What's going on?

267
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:52,840
How do I fix this? How do I fix this? What happened? Do I have to fix that? Four? Okay.

268
00:54:52,840 --> 00:55:01,960
I'm through the tunnel. I think four 38, three 22. I'm through the tunnel. All right. So I'm right

269
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,579
here. So I just kind of have to go like right. And then down. So we'll go like this and go

270
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:29,300
get to solve equations. So I need to hit five 60. Okay. You need to solve the math quiz.

271
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:39,190
Now these, all these math problem, Andy's, they tell me, Oh, I got to solve a math problem.

272
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:50,150
I know how to do math, math problem, Andy. I'm sorry. 500, 300. All right. I'm close. 500,

273
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,190
five 62 77.

274
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:59,929
I've 62 77. I gotta go up. Did I pass it? Two 77. Oh, this way. All right. I'm almost there.

275
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:10,119
Let me see. What does this person say? It should be like, I ain't never going to use the Pythagorean

276
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:14,599
theorem and then stream for a living. Like you are right. But regular people, sane people use it

277
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:31,750
sometimes. No, don't quit the game. I didn't always stream for a living. Even worse. I was

278
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:41,349
a substitute teacher. Do I need to know the Pythagorean theorem to do this? No, who cares?

279
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:54,869
Whatever. Whatever. I don't care. I win. I win. I win. All right. 43, five 60. I'm there. So I need

280
00:57:54,869 --> 00:58:03,510
to turn to 43. But the Pythagorean theorem, man, like, what are you talking about? I don't need to

281
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:07,989
know the Pythagorean theorem to order from the Wendy's drive-through. Like who cares?

282
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:17,320
Like, okay. I understand. If you're like a contractor, you're like a architect or something,

283
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,880
right? Or you're like making blueprints or you're like doing work in like 3D design. All right.

284
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:42,019
It's specific work. That's like a big fish. Did I get it? Okay. I got it. So we got to go.

285
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:56,139
Wait, I want to see another angle of this. That was crazy. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm a clown for a

286
00:58:56,139 --> 00:59:01,579
living. Do you? Okay. When the clown blows... Do you understand what you're fucking, what you're

287
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:07,909
asking, who you're talking to? Do you understand who you're talking to right now? Like, honestly,

288
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:13,829
like if you do go to the clown show or the magician show and they do like balloon animals,

289
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:19,110
you don't like raise your hand and the clown's like, all right, yes, you. Um, can you like solve

290
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:24,570
this for X? The guy's going to be like, what do you want from me? I don't fucking do that.

291
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,039
I don't. I fucking make balloon animals for a living. What do you want me to do?

292
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:40,170
No, you're not going to have like the clown do like a fucking complex math problem. All right.

293
00:59:40,170 --> 01:00:04,329
So we're going to go down here. This is open water too. All right. 55. Let's go here. Why is this?

294
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:13,639
What if he's a math clown? You'd get booed. A math clown would get fucking booed off the stage.

295
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:27,579
Are you serious? He comes out up there like, I can't. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. So you see the

296
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:31,659
right angle here. What I want you kids to do is I want you to take out your pens and papers and I

297
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:37,340
want you to write down. This is 90 here. Okay. And then this is just 180 times those three angles

298
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:43,659
together. And I want you to solve, uh, what the area is. It'd be like kids start crying.

299
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:48,179
Kids would be fucking crying in the audience. You're going to make a bunch of kids cry.

300
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,699
The parents would leave shitty Yelp reviews. It'd be like we ordered a clown and the guy did like

301
01:00:55,699 --> 01:01:03,510
math problems and like it was fucking terrible. I wish I could have gotten my money back. 613.

302
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:30,500
What's the 190? Okay. I'm on the right track. All right. I'm getting there. 197. That's literally

303
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:39,619
a family guy joke. You stole that from the show. No, I, I, guys, I don't, I didn't, I didn't, I,

304
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:45,139
no, I didn't. No, I didn't. That's not even in family guy. That's not in family guy. You're a

305
01:01:45,139 --> 01:02:02,150
liar. Okay. 55. It's not. No, it's not. The thing is everybody will believe you because family guy,

306
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:06,309
like that could be a family guy joke and everyone will believe you because family guys made a bunch

307
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:13,880
of just like random references to every single thing ever. Skeleton, the rib cage or something.

308
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:41,639
I need to get a little closer. 613. One nine seven. Okay. Is that close enough?

309
01:02:42,280 --> 01:03:05,639
195. All right. 55. Is that close enough? Holy shit. It's like a dinosaur. Hold on. Holy shit.

310
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:21,500
Okay. Wait a little more. Whoa. That's kind of cool. All right. This is going to be a pain in

311
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:30,889
the ass. Um, so if I go from here, I just go that way. I don't want to crash into this though.

312
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:41,820
That's kind of cool. I even checked for scurvy. I'm kind of concerned as I drink like a green

313
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:52,340
tea drink that has like vitamin C. I'm fine. All right. Let me just make sure I know where I am.

314
01:03:52,340 --> 01:04:02,550
640 195. 640 195. So I'm like here. So from now just go boink. I should be fine for a little while.

315
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:22,139
I'm confused about what's happening. Uh, I am somebody that is locked in this submarine

316
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:26,969
and it's my job to go take pictures of anomalies that are on the bottom of the ocean.

317
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:34,329
All life has been removed from the planet. Uh, and I, there's like a space station that they have

318
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:38,730
created and then people that were on space stations, um, stay alive, I guess. Cause like

319
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:49,849
everything on planets died. I don't know. It's interesting. All right. I should slow down here.

320
01:04:49,849 --> 01:05:09,139
Seven 10 eggs, seven 10, two 50, seven 10, two 50. I'm about right here. All right. Still on the

321
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:18,170
right path. Keep going. I'm going to, this is going to be so hard to navigate this little hole.

322
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:35,050
Okay. I think so it's seven 32, two 70, seven 32, two 70. I'm like here. All right. So this

323
01:05:35,050 --> 01:06:07,369
should be all right. Now I just have to just weave through this. Yo, are you scared? Yeah,

324
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:17,300
it's kind of weird. Okay. Seven. I gotta make sure I'm in the tunnel, which I might not be.

325
01:06:18,280 --> 01:07:13,820
Two seven 62 68. I'm in the tunnel. I'm like right here. Yep. All right. Easy. Seven

326
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:26,809
all right. I think I'm in seven 88, two 71, seven 88, two 70. All right. I'm like here.

327
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:30,760
So I gotta go right and then yeah. Okay. We're good. We made it through.

328
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:51,960
What the fuck is a wall right there? Where am I? Huh? Eight. Okay. Eight, two 75,

329
01:07:51,960 --> 01:08:18,470
800, two 75. Where is this birth canal? I'm going to be coming out of the birth canal. Just wait.

330
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:46,119
Okay. Eight 64, two 58. Getting there. This is kind of far out of the way.

331
01:08:55,590 --> 01:09:47,319
Eight 64, two 58, two oh nine eight. I'm close. What is that? Eight 64,

332
01:09:48,890 --> 01:10:11,159
two 58. Eight 60. I gotta get closer. How am I gonna get closer? Eight 64, two 58.

333
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:56,819
Is it this? Should I just turn the angle a little? It's like a log in the way. Am I not in the right

334
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:20,920
spot? Eight 64, two oh nine. Eight 64, two 58, two oh nine. I mean this is like almost exactly

335
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:35,800
where it is. Oh I got it. That was weird. What is that? It's like a log. So I gotta get out of here

336
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:43,739
and go up. Oh this is gonna be a huge pain in the ass. Looked like a house. Yeah it kind of did.

337
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:52,539
It's like a building. Yeah. That was weird. All right. I gotta get out of here now.

338
01:11:59,609 --> 01:12:15,380
You should crash. It's funny. All right. So I'm here. I need to go like left. Gotta be careful.

339
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:29,270
This is a little tight area too. Eight 30, 300. Eight 30, 300. Eight 30, 300. All right. I'm like

340
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:43,380
I gotta go down left here. I'm way too high up. Easy. All right. Here it is. All right. Yeah.

341
01:12:43,939 --> 01:13:02,329
I think I'm in the tunnel right now. Yeah. I definitely am. What do you guys call me

342
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:25,720
facing here? What is this? I recently started watching a lot of Ludwig and watch him at night.

343
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,479
I fall asleep usually. I had a dream one night where I was watching myself sleeping almost like

344
01:13:29,479 --> 01:13:36,119
astral projecting. Suddenly Jerma wearing a beer hat and doing his ape walk comes through the wall

345
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:39,880
above me and peeks into my brain to see if I'm dreaming about him. After seeing that he starts

346
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,399
after seeing that I am he starts walking through the opposite wall while he repeats

347
01:13:43,399 --> 01:14:11,479
number one variety streamer. Number one variety streamer. All right. People don't minus two me.

348
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:21,659
I just read it. You didn't even comment on it. What do you how am I supposed to comment on it?

349
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:27,180
Well that was a crazy one man. That's crazy. People have fucked up dreams about me. I don't

350
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:51,750
know why. Okay. Worst one guy moment. No. No. We don't do worst one guy moment. We don't do worst.

351
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:57,100
We only do best one guy moment. I and that's not how it works. Did I just hit something?

352
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:13,140
What did I just have? What happened? I didn't hit. Nothing was on the radar. All right. Where am I

353
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:23,239
now? Five seven five sixty three fifty five sixty three fifty. I'm how did I end up up? Wait what?

354
01:15:24,279 --> 01:15:33,300
Five sixty three three fifty. Okay. Right. Five sixty three three fifty. I'm here. All right. So

355
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:59,189
I just got to go up. If I see a wall be careful. All right. Is it blood? All right. Four hundred.

356
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:06,119
Why four hundred? We're about here. Five fifty six. Okay. So I just need to I'm going through here

357
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:14,149
right now. So we're going to go up and then right. What happened? What happened? What the

358
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:32,300
fuck just happened? What? What the fuck happened? Where was I? Jesus. How did I crash? I was. What?

359
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:57,590
What's going on? What the fuck's happening? I got some soft locked? How? No I'm not. It's an auto

360
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:20,569
save that. Oh shit. Oh come on. I was like halfway. I was like more than halfway through the game.

361
01:17:22,630 --> 01:17:33,899
Is there a save I can pull somewhere? It's like an auto save thing. Is there an auto save that like

362
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:53,270
is in sections or something? Speed run it. Shit. That's so sad. That's so sad. Oh my god. Let me

363
01:17:53,270 --> 01:18:03,819
see if I can speed run it. Fuck. That sucks. That sucks so bad. What the fuck? Okay. What happened?

364
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:11,779
I'm so. I okay. I understand the game. I'm just going to go fast and I'm going to get it done.

365
01:18:11,779 --> 01:18:26,630
Go watch somebody's let's play. You can do it. See you in 20 minutes. No soft locks.

366
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:37,289
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? It's a tweet. Someone tell Jerma I can tell them how to fix their save.

367
01:18:37,289 --> 01:18:44,329
How do I do it? How do I do it? How do I do it? That's so funny. How do I fix my save? The dev

368
01:18:44,329 --> 01:18:50,729
literally just tweeted this. All right. I'm going to refresh the dev's twitter and see if he gives

369
01:18:50,729 --> 01:19:09,060
me a solution. It's in the game files. It's too late. Replace the newest auto save with a previous

370
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:15,619
one. Okay. Is it not too late? Did I? I didn't just do it. I didn't just fuck it up. Did I?

371
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:32,810
What did he say? He's so silly. Quick. He's reading. He's watching your tweets. Go. Oh shit.

372
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:40,010
He's playing it. Thank. Okay. All right. How do I do it? Jerma soft locking himself through the game

373
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:57,220
halfway is probably on brand. Okay. New tweet, new tweet. What do we got? Hold on Jerma. I'm typing a

374
01:19:57,220 --> 01:20:10,539
solution. All right. He can DM them all. Yeah. You DM one of the mods. They'll help. Close the game.

375
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:20,810
I'm just going to close the game, right? Okay. Closing the game tech support. All right. Game is

376
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:34,409
closed. Okay. What do we do? What do I do? What should I do from here? Hold on, dude. I'm typing.

377
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:59,050
Okay. All right. All right. He said, I'm typing, laughing my ass off. That was a big one. Let me

378
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:08,090
see if I can get a huge one and catch it. The fan. Okay. I've got a fan going back here. That's

379
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:15,779
fucking this up. This fan is blowing the bubbles. I need to turn the fan off because it's too much

380
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:49,590
circulation of the air. Okay. Here we go. Oh, that went in my mouth. Fuck you. Got a new tweet.

381
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:57,270
The mod. Okay. VR Josh just said, LOL, did anyone get a DM of the jacket? No. Nope. Is he going to

382
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:10,890
tweet it? No, no, no. He's probably going to tweet out the solution. He's typing. What if he just

383
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:14,729
doesn't tweet ever again? What if he's just fucking with it and he just like, it's like,

384
01:22:14,729 --> 01:23:01,619
oh yeah, I got you man. It just doesn't do it. We said it for like 40 minutes. Don't try this

385
01:23:01,619 --> 01:23:25,800
on. God damn it. Tweet. Open the save folder in the install and open the progress file. Find the

386
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,199
data block called fake underscore sub and change the coordinates to something safe that I'm trying

387
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:45,159
to figure out. What? What? Open. Is this fake? It's making, is this a joke? He's making it up.

388
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:54,260
It's a joke. Okay. Open the save folder in the install. Okay. Let me do this right now.

389
01:23:54,260 --> 01:24:06,390
Save folder in the install. So is it like this, like the steam folder, right? Like steam. Okay.

390
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:10,310
It's like steam, steam apps, right? I'm desperately trying to open the project to

391
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:14,310
figure out what the closest safe coordinates would be. Also, I don't know any of the mods

392
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:19,850
to DM. LOL. I never use Twitch. This is, I love it. This is fucking hilarious.

393
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:29,560
All right. So let me, it's in steam, like steam apps, right? Steam, steam apps, steam. Okay.

394
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:44,149
Steam, steam apps, program files, steam apps. Okay. All right. It's in steam, steam apps,

395
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:55,420
and then iron lung, right? Yep. Okay. Iron lung. Okay. Save. Progress. Open this with a text

396
01:24:55,420 --> 01:25:11,850
editor, right? Notepad. All right. I got it. So I've got coordinates. Find the data block called

397
01:25:11,850 --> 01:25:30,520
quote fake sub, fake sub, teleport true, no monster, fake sub. Okay. Fake underscore sub

398
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:36,600
and change the coordinates X and Y to something else. Oh shit. Okay. Where was I? I was 550

399
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:52,710
six. All right. I got it. How about like five, like 30, like three, like three, like 70 is 380.

400
01:25:52,710 --> 01:26:00,699
What was it on the bud? Okay. I'm going to try five 30. Oh fuck. Oops. Okay. What should I,

401
01:26:01,579 --> 01:26:15,909
what's like a safe thing to do right there? Okay. All right. All right. X I'm going to do five,

402
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:40,699
like 545. Y is Y is currently minus two. Z is 400. Solve for X. Fuck. New tweet. We got a new

403
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:56,119
tweet. What does it say? Oh, I gotta go like wash my mouth. 15 minutes ago, you said you will never

404
01:26:56,119 --> 01:27:05,449
have to find a solution to X and Y. And here we are. I, but this is not, that's not even legit

405
01:27:05,449 --> 01:27:12,869
though. What you're describing it. New tweet. This isn't, this is a completely, this is a complete

406
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:23,659
anomaly. Leave Y alone. I beg you. You need to leave Y alone. Oh shit. Okay. Try X five 60,

407
01:27:23,659 --> 01:27:32,140
Y three 30. New tweet. No, wait. Z three 30. Oh, dev. Looks like you're having a little bit

408
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:37,000
trouble with geometry. Aren't you? Looks like the dev is having a little bit of trouble with

409
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,520
geometry. Just like, I'm, I'm dev. When was the last time you were in fucking high school?

410
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:48,810
When was I, I am going to get so validated right now. When was the last time? How, how,

411
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:55,590
when was the last time you were in high school? Bingo. Right. I keep this, this is perfect.

412
01:27:56,229 --> 01:28:18,699
All right. X five 60, like five 60 with no decimal, just five 60, like 0.5 60.0 and Z three 30.

413
01:28:18,699 --> 01:28:30,069
Okay. Three 30.0 done save. I'm opening the game right now. I suck at math.

414
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:37,340
I suck at math. I am in my thirties. I haven't had to do this for years. Go look at the tweet

415
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:41,500
right now. I'm going to fucking, I'm framing this. I'm literally going to frame that tweet

416
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:49,609
from dusk dev. Thank you so much. I'm so glad this happened. I'm so glad this happened.

417
01:28:50,170 --> 01:29:16,710
Unbelievable. I'm going to frame that tweet. Okay. Let's go. Here we go. Are you ready?

418
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:50,090
Thank you so much. Oh, it worked. Oh yes. This is for like babies, right? Like this,

419
01:29:50,090 --> 01:30:00,619
I'm not going to get like, please recycle where facilities exist. Do not drink bubble solution.

420
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:09,850
Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse with water immediately. No, I'm fine. Non-toxic

421
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:22,220
no dyes. Yeah, I'm fine. Non-toxic no dyes. I'm fine. Yeah, we're good. This is, I'm so glad.

422
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:32,060
It's just soap. I know I'm whatever. I spit it out. I put like a tiny bit right here.

423
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:45,020
So where I'm five 60, three 30, five 60, which is like right here. Three 30, which is like right

424
01:30:45,020 --> 01:31:06,979
here. So I just have to go up here. Oh, dev hero. Yeah. Okay. Let me tell you something right now.

425
01:31:06,979 --> 01:31:17,420
I like love, I love dusk dev games. I ain't just going to leave. No, I'm not going to play. Oh yeah.

426
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:39,479
I'm just going to go into Glover. No way. No way. No chance. I have 61, 395. So I'm like right here.

427
01:31:39,479 --> 01:32:01,880
Okay. So pull it this way. So the dusk Twitter, go dust dev Twitter, go like open it right now.

428
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:07,750
He didn't tell anybody what he was doing. He's writing, try five 60, three 30. No, no, no.

429
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:12,069
Z three 30. Oh, I beg, leave me alone. I beg you. I forgot how to do math.

430
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:23,850
Somebody replied and said, are you defusing a fucking bomb? People don't know what he's talking

431
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:49,770
about. He just looks unhinged. That's so funny. Are you diffusing a bomb? I mean, we're in the

432
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:58,460
tunnel. How come you can't just have a normal play through of a game? I don't know, dude.

433
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:04,100
I feel like there's been a few Mario sunshine was a normal play through. That was a normal play

434
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:19,479
through. What happened with that one? That was fine. Okay. I think I'm through five, four 30,

435
01:33:19,479 --> 01:33:44,090
five 73, four 30, five 73. I think if I spit on that, it would blow level almost. It looked like

436
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:54,729
it was really glossy. It could have been five 73, we're 28. So I'm just going to go up. I'm

437
01:33:54,729 --> 01:34:13,140
right there. I'm through. Oh, geometry. I'm so fucking happy. I'm in my thirties. I haven't

438
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:19,670
done it in a lot. Yeah, I know, man. I know. And I, I'm telling you, I feel so good right now.

439
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:45,130
I feel great. I'm so happy that happened. Okay. Five 75, four 76. What was that? Five 75,

440
01:34:45,130 --> 01:35:00,819
four 70. I'm like right here. So this thing is at six 23, five 20. So I got to start pulling it this

441
01:35:00,819 --> 01:36:04,170
way. All right. Worms are six 23, five 20 incoming. What was that? That was like I was about to do it,

442
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:25,529
but I realized it was like not really called for 63. Whoa. It's another like dinosaur skeleton.

443
01:36:25,529 --> 01:36:55,000
It's a dinosaur skeleton. I need to back up. Turn to the left. I think I'm too close. That should

444
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:19,029
be it, right? No, six 23, five 20, 63. All right. That's as close as it's going to get, man. 63.

445
01:37:19,029 --> 01:37:36,500
All right. Got it. It's like another dinosaur bone. So how do I get up here? This way and up.

446
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:49,079
This is not on the map. Like, can I go this way? It looks like maybe I could. All right. I'm going

447
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:54,039
to go this way. So I just got to turn. I just have to turn. My mouth is like Sophie. I'll be right back.

448
01:37:54,039 --> 01:40:07,930
Give me one second. All right. I'm back. I'm better. I'm better. Very cool. Let's go. Both

449
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:13,340
headphones have to go in. I feel better. Yeah. Now try that at home. Don't fucking do what I did. I

450
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:20,359
was trying to catch like a bubble on my like lips and like blow it back out. Didn't work. Don't do

451
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:26,619
that. Unless you're a certified professional clown like me. Well, professional in like quotes. Like I

452
01:40:26,619 --> 01:40:37,619
give myself that term. All right. All right. Let's go. So where am I? I need to go just left.

453
01:40:37,619 --> 01:41:09,770
I don't want to crash. He sounds kind of sad. Is he okay? Bro, I'm fine. I just ate a bunch of like

454
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:23,659
KFC. I'm good. Ah, I'd fuck an extra crispy bucket. He looks like a greasy butt. I don't care.

455
01:41:23,659 --> 01:41:36,340
Whatever. All right. Five, six, five, six, one, five, 10, five, 61. So I got to go kind of left.

456
01:41:39,829 --> 01:42:11,100
All right. What am I looking for? I'm looking for like four, like 350 X while staying at about 500.

457
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:50,329
Don't. Don't. Where even am I? What's going on here? I'm really close to what wall am I close to?

458
01:42:50,329 --> 01:43:19,239
43514. 430. There's no wall here. What happens? Am I going to die? Okay. This bubble solution all

459
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:32,789
over my keyboard and it's like I'm sliding around it. I think I'm playing Glover with a controller.

460
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:37,350
It's soap. It's fine. It's literally soap. Like it's like I can. I got to clean the keyboard anyways.

461
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:45,350
It's probably in a while. The dev said they're going to patch the bug that I just saw in the

462
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:56,710
next update. It's fast. It's not. It's all right. Okay. Three. What am I looking for?

463
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:30,819
300 or like 350 500. All right. Keep going. Is this a wall? It's a tree. Okay. Watch out for trees.

464
01:44:30,819 --> 01:45:30,170
What the? How do I get what? Five 358 519 358 519. Can I go up here? Can I actually go this way? 358

465
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:49,640
595. All right. I'm just going to go. I think I can go to the right. Can I? Am I? Is this like

466
01:45:49,640 --> 01:47:08,699
not what I'm supposed to be doing? Oh shit. What is that? You're a beta male. Okay. Well,

467
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:15,300
um, correct me if I'm wrong, but a beta male is a higher version than alpha male. Beta would be

468
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:35,479
0.1. Alpha would be 0.01. So you think I fucking care? So what I get to be like a bigger, like a

469
01:47:35,479 --> 01:47:53,180
more like a better version, a more complete version, not a beta male. Yeah. Yeah. You think

470
01:47:53,180 --> 01:48:03,220
that's a beta? Okay. I don't know what drugs you're taking. Just wait till I get to. Yeah. Wait till

471
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:24,869
I get to release 1.0 man. All right. I think I'm through 367 619, three, wait, 619. So I'm like

472
01:48:24,869 --> 01:48:35,449
right here. Let's just go up. I want Jim bro. Jerma back. Jim bro. Jerma was 10 fucking years

473
01:48:35,449 --> 01:49:00,250
ago. It's never coming back. So I just got to go straight up here. This is going to be so hard to

474
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:36,199
navigate. Oh my God. So just 325 741 325 741. You just got unfazed by the fire. I mean, I saw the,

475
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:42,260
I almost said extinguisher, like fucking the pyro. I saw the extinguisher over there. So I knew it was

476
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:47,909
going to probably happen eventually. What is the baseball stream? By the way, you'll find out the

477
01:49:47,909 --> 01:50:35,000
baseball stream. That's it. 741 325. What's the angle? 18. That's definitely going to get removed.

478
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:58,619
That's going to get removed from a moderator, but it was fucking crazy. Oh my God. It's a big crab

479
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:06,180
that got auto-modded. I know. I know. I know. I, but I don't get it. It was fucking weird.

480
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:10,340
It got auto-modded. All right. Whatever it was, it got auto-modded. That's all you need to know.

481
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:17,770
It was whatever. What the fuck is that? Can I get a better view?

482
01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:31,100
We have to know. I have to know. What was it? Yeah. Yes. In the mod chat. That's what it was.

483
01:51:31,659 --> 01:51:36,859
That's what it was. I don't, I'm not going to encourage this behavior, but I'm going to tell

484
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:41,340
you something right now. Don't fucking, this is not to be encouraged, but it was just like,

485
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:47,210
what the fuck, man? Somebody asked what the baseball stream is. And I said, whatever. And

486
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:50,409
then like, it was been like five minutes. I've been like at least five minutes.

487
01:51:50,409 --> 01:51:55,689
Somebody like added that person, I think, and said he's going to shove an entire baseball up his ass

488
01:51:55,689 --> 01:52:07,189
on stream. And this shit got grabbed immediately. And I read it because it's like auto-mod doesn't

489
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:16,789
delete it. It was like 20 seconds. I know. But still like, what the fuck are you talking about?

490
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:20,939
This is that, that behavior is not to be encouraged by the way. I'm just saying.

491
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:31,000
All right. So do I go left or right? I'm going to say left. So I got to go down and then right.

492
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:38,390
I don't want to encourage that kind of behavior, but like that's, it's his final stream. It's not

493
01:52:38,390 --> 01:53:02,090
my, what, this person's name too. Yeah. What the fuck? The person's name was, all right, whatever.

494
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:09,909
We don't need to say the person's name because I don't, I don't want to, you can find it. I don't

495
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:22,899
know. The name was Ball Fondler. Okay. Okay. Do you want me to tell you more? Cause like, I could

496
01:53:22,899 --> 01:53:39,510
tell you more. Don't encourage that behavior. That person's probably, that person's probably

497
01:53:39,510 --> 01:53:51,579
timed out for like a half an hour. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

498
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:57,739
Okay. Let's see what we have to go down here. Down to at least three 50, three 50 with a side

499
01:53:57,739 --> 01:54:15,289
of the one 82 free 17, six 93, six 93. I'm like right here. I'm doing the TTS boys chop. I'm doing

500
01:54:15,289 --> 01:54:32,920
the TTS tick-tock voice chop up. It's like the little kid way to say shut up. Come on. Streamer

501
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:46,649
is actively making modding a challenge. My mods are going to fucking revolt. I think six 60. All

502
01:54:46,649 --> 01:55:08,819
right. Keep going and then bang a kind of thing. A left. Did you watch Morbius? No dude. Why would

503
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:16,869
I, you could have told me that Morbius went straight to DVD and I would be like, okay, I don't like

504
01:55:16,869 --> 01:55:28,180
so like Morbius is like the Aladdin three of the Marvel universe. I don't, what do you want me to

505
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:50,600
say? I don't, I didn't, I didn't see it. One 80. Okay. Where am I? Morbius got $1.3 billion at the

506
01:55:50,600 --> 01:56:11,210
box office. I know it did not. What? How he 77 60. I'm like right here. I got to pull it up a little.

507
01:56:11,210 --> 01:57:03,220
There's something behind me. What's behind me? Do you hear that? I don't see anything. All right.

508
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:15,800
Do I need to go? Where am I? Six to 68, 623, 68. I'm like right here. 623 here. I got to go up and

509
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:37,989
left. Are you going to scream your Morbius reaction review at some point? Okay. What is this? Because

510
01:57:37,989 --> 01:58:20,920
it's like, Oh, okay. I got to go that way. Oh shit. All right. Where am I? All right. I got it. I got

511
01:58:20,920 --> 01:58:55,779
it. I'm in, I'm in 258, 658. I'm like right here. So I got to go left in a, at, at about

512
01:58:58,340 --> 01:59:16,810
at about like one 80 or so. I got to take a left. I'm going to stream today. I want to drink alcohol

513
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:22,090
in the later hours. I mean, I'm going to do this. We're going to go to Glover and then if Glover

514
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:47,270
sucks, we're going to play another game. Okay. I got to go left. 201, six 80, six, no, six 60,

515
01:59:47,270 --> 02:00:49,539
201, six. Okay. I'm like right here. So I'm about to hit this wall. So I got to go left. Hey,

516
02:00:49,619 --> 02:01:57,500
what's going on? What the fuck is that? I got it. There's one more. It's the leak. What leak?

517
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:07,720
Am I under water? I'm not, I'm not under water right now. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm

518
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:39,689
going. Is this just chasing me? Is it chasing me? All right. Two 76, six 35, two 76. I'm like

519
02:02:39,689 --> 02:03:13,140
six 35. Am I out? Two 76, six 35. Okay. Keep going. Now this way. You've hit something. He's 40.

520
02:03:13,140 --> 02:03:19,479
Let him ask questions. I teleported. Three 10, six 44. Wait, what? What are you talking about?

521
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:39,109
Oh, teleported. Oh, okay. So I just got to go all the way to right. They changed the coordinates.

522
02:03:39,750 --> 02:03:50,460
That's fucked up. This game's fucked up. All right. For X, I'm looking for,

523
02:03:51,100 --> 02:04:18,569
I'm looking for like 450. I got a long way to go. He's fucked up. This game's crazy. Okay.

524
02:04:23,590 --> 02:04:32,649
Stop pretending. This is going to be a pain in the ass. All right. So I'm at 445 and I'm 700.

525
02:04:32,649 --> 02:04:37,979
So I'm right here. I'm like right here. I just got to go kind of hold this way.

526
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:50,579
Just navigate through here. Holy shit. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

527
02:04:55,300 --> 02:05:21,819
What the fuck are you talking about, dude? Okay. Um, oh my God. Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait,

528
02:05:21,819 --> 02:05:29,560
wait, wait, wait. 492, six 89. I'm like right here. Just keep going. Right. Just keep going.

529
02:05:34,489 --> 02:06:04,039
And then I'm going to go up at around five, like 40. That was like a dragon. All right. Five 40,

530
02:06:04,119 --> 02:06:22,010
six 90, five 40, six 90. I'm like right here. Hey, let me go. And then once I hit about seven

531
02:06:22,010 --> 02:07:13,079
55, okay. What the fuck? Seven 55, five 80, seven 50, five 80, seven 50. Right after I freeze it.

532
02:07:13,079 --> 02:07:41,779
Oh, thank God. It's just wood. Six 11, seven 50, six 10, seven 50, six 10, seven. Okay. So I'm

533
02:07:41,779 --> 02:07:57,109
like right here. So I gotta go like this. God damn it. Is it behind me? Why is it blinking faster

534
02:07:57,109 --> 02:08:12,260
when I go this way? Dude, why is it doing that? Six 30, seven 75, six 30, like right here. Seven

535
02:08:12,260 --> 02:09:03,739
75. I'm like right here. Six 50, seven 80. Okay. Keep going. Okay. All right. Seven. All right.

536
02:09:03,739 --> 02:09:17,500
Almost at 800 and almost 680. All right. I'm going through 670, 680, 800, 680, 800. All right. It's

537
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:47,210
just right ahead. Whatever it is. What's the angle? 828, 295, six. Okay. Don't move. 295. What is it

538
02:09:47,210 --> 02:10:29,829
again? 828. I started to like look this way and this eye, this eye. I went like, I went reverse

539
02:10:29,829 --> 02:10:36,619
cross. I went frog eye for a second. I went like this. I was like, I want to be like,

540
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:45,130
am I in the right spot? And it came out. I saw like this and this at the same time.

541
02:10:45,130 --> 02:10:56,680
The expedition only raised more questions than answers. Satellite images showed pieces of the

542
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:01,770
SM-13 scattered all over the bottom of the ocean trench as though it had been torn apart by some

543
02:11:01,770 --> 02:11:06,359
huge beast. The wreckage cannot be reached at this time. No photographs have been recovered.

544
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:11,000
The stars shine pale as bones. The moon is a lifeless corpse. It's ocean a gaping wound.

545
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:18,779
The universe, what's left of it is dying, but somewhere in the void, there must be hope.

546
02:11:18,779 --> 02:11:29,189
Frog eyed. That was fucking crazy. Yeah. I didn't think it was going to, I was like about to take

547
02:11:29,189 --> 02:12:00,220
the picture. I'm like, oh, is this right? It's like I, I blinked. I heard the sound and my like right

548
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:09,239
eye got to see it. It's almost like I wasn't paying attention to the horror movie because I was like,

549
02:12:09,239 --> 02:12:14,039
ah, this is a horror movie. Yeah. Whatever. It's like you take a bite of your popcorn

550
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:25,210
and then you hear and it's like something happened. I'll show it here. Imagine if I was

551
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:49,319
at the movie theater and had a bowl of popcorn. Perfect. All right. So check this out.

552
02:12:59,319 --> 02:13:03,479
I was looking at my phone or something and I heard the sound and then saw it.

553
02:13:10,489 --> 02:13:23,029
Look at that reaction time, man. Like Jesus look over.

554
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:40,220
Oh, we're going to go slower. Man. That's these Mike and I sure are delicious.

555
02:13:48,180 --> 02:13:50,899
I'm not even looking at the fucking screen.

556
02:13:54,199 --> 02:14:08,010
Not even fucking paying attention. Oh, it's always like, I was like sympathy screaming,

557
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:13,159
right? Like, cause other people in the audience is screaming. Everybody else is yelling. So like,

558
02:14:13,159 --> 02:14:22,069
oh my God, something must be happening that I need to be aware of. Okay. Like imagine here,

559
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:35,960
this is like what happens. You hear like, oh, I got to react. Something horrible happened.

560
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:50,390
Okay. That was iron lung. That was fun. That was cool. I've come to clean about something.

561
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:55,979
I could not watch your entire Pokemon snap. Vaughn, you kept using the item throwing joystick to move

562
02:14:55,979 --> 02:15:03,109
the guy. I didn't play that. Delete that. Oh, that was fun. So now we're going to move on.

563
02:15:03,109 --> 02:15:07,510
That was iron lung. That game was supposed to be like a 45 minute experience and I made it like

564
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:12,020
three hours. Well, no, it's two hours. To be fair though, I had a, I had a glitch.

565
02:15:12,949 --> 02:15:19,140
There was a glitch. I had to like 15 to 20 minutes. We had to kind of figure that out.

566
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:23,739
I had soap in my mouth. I had to get rid of it. So now we're going to play Glover.

567
02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:36,199
Glover for the N64. It was ported to Steam. And I have to be very honest with you. If I'm,

568
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:41,750
we're going to have to gauge how people like this and the same rules that strawberry magic had apply

569
02:15:41,750 --> 02:16:01,750
to the, the glove buddies. There's a new tweet. What's it say? Oh, Jerma's biggest jump scare.

570
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:06,069
I fixed the bundle and I fixed a Jerma's stream. Anything more I need to fix tonight?

571
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:16,970
Hold on. Wait a minute. You get iron lung plus dusk plus dusk 82. How much is that?

572
02:16:16,970 --> 02:16:30,060
Is it bundle on Steam? How much is it? I got to show this. How much is the bundle? 30 bucks,

573
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:41,930
20 bucks. That's pretty sick. 20, 30. I mean, that was cool. Said like one of your friends

574
02:16:41,930 --> 02:16:46,020
down and be like, yeah, I'll play this and watch them scream at the end and look at their popcorn

575
02:16:46,020 --> 02:17:07,770
and then, um, like sympathy yell because everybody else is. All right, give me one

576
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:18,889
second. I'm going to put Glover up. Okay. Glover incoming.
