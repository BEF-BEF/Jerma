1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:10,359
So I'm sitting here questioning a couple things about the state of media and how, hear me out.

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:22,170
So why is it that I can play The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring on PlayStation 2

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:30,260
with a bunch of cutscenes and all the fucking music, but I can't watch The Fellowship of the

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:37,130
Ring on Twitch? Why am I not allowed to do that? Why can I play The Fellowship of the Ring the game,

5
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,250
but I can't watch The Fellowship of the Ring the movie? It's, I don't understand.

6
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:51,740
What happened to my fucking, my cord got all fucked up. Aren't they under the same boat? Is it

7
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:59,179
licensing? All right, but okay, but if Shadow of, Shadow of War came out like two years ago,

8
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:13,590
if I listen to The Hobbit's song in Shadow of War, but then I play a clip of The Hobbit's song

9
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:26,390
on YouTube, my channel gets, gets muted. That's weird. Like, is that, I don't understand.

10
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:37,530
Dermot, your audio is sounding nice and crisp today. Ha, well, look at you. We're playing Lord

11
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,129
of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring today because one person guaranteed I wouldn't get

12
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:52,310
past the first level. So, that's what we're doing. I don't know why you would say that because I,

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,500
weirdly enough, my memory does not remember this one. Yeah, there it is. Lord of the Rings,

14
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,859
you won't make it. Here we go. Just for, just for context, for those of you that are curious,

15
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:13,020
here's the context here. You won't get past the first part of Fellowship, I guarantee it.

16
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,129
All right, I wouldn't, all right, I wouldn't remember your name because when I get past

17
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,659
level one in Fellowship of the Ring, I'm going to fucking scream your name. Right. What was

18
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,500
the name? Fake what? Here comes another hype train. Wait, I, I like made, I made this harder

19
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,020
to do. I increased it. All right. Well, here we go. Here we go again. When I get, when I'm done.

20
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,620
Fake. All right. Fake, fake. Here comes the hype train. When I am done with. Uh,

21
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:54,259
thanks for the hype train, guys. All right. Free, free hype trains in three days. This is like,

22
00:02:54,259 --> 00:03:00,250
all right. When you, when you go to, when you, when you ride a ride at Disney World,

23
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:05,849
right? When you get on the hype train and you ride, you ride the fucking new Star Wars ride.

24
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:13,110
And it's like, holy shit, that was hype. That was insane. That was incredible. Oh, oh my God,

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,550
when Han Solo like flew by, dude, I shit my pants. Let's do it again. And you ride it again.

26
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,939
On the third or fourth ride on the hype train, on the hype ride, you look up and you start to see

27
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:31,479
where the fucking mechanical shit is. I, oh, wait. Oh, there's Han Solo. I can see the wire.

28
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:42,789
I can see the wire up there and it's connected to an arm. Oh, hi. Fuck. We're getting, there's

29
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:51,370
too many hype trains. All right. This is fucking ridiculous. Rusty bars. Oh no. Wait, hold on a

30
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,689
minute. Is there, is there a scratch on that LCD screen? Yeah. I didn't notice that on the first

31
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:07,930
fucking hype. Ah, Gary, should we have rode this ride 10 times in a row? Where are your kids?

32
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:25,720
Level three complete already. Level three. Here comes level four. Get on the hype train. Never

33
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,029
get off. Never get off the hype train. Already level four. You guys are not fucking around today.

34
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:39,110
We're just doing it. But okay. That's my point with this whole thing is I got to tweak some

35
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,750
numbers on this because I don't want to ride the Han Solo ride 20 times in a row and every day

36
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,970
I'm just sitting there. Get hype for the hype train. There's Han Solo. There he goes. Yeah.

37
00:04:52,310 --> 00:05:00,379
Get hype. Oh, fuck. You've given me so much money in four days. I don't want it to be like

38
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:04,300
just going through the motions thing for me. I'm going to tweak the numbers. I'm going to make it

39
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,009
harder to do. We'll see. I thought I already did that, but you guys are fucking, you guys are so

40
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:16,420
generous. Like even if I keep making this harder to do, you're probably still going to do it.

41
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:32,259
You're still going to do it. Get hype or else. Oh man. Thanks guys. Seriously. This is fucking

42
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:43,100
too much. There's a lot of the rings. All right. You did it. Hype. You did it. Hype. Hype. Hype.

43
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:54,660
Hype. Hype. Hype. Thank you guys. Seriously. Level four. Oh, dude. There's only five minutes

44
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:07,100
to get this train out of the station. Dude. Four minutes and 30 seconds remain. What the?

45
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:32,100
Let's go. Start it. Do it. 27%, 28%. Come on, man. We can do this. We can do this three days in a

46
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:47,769
row. That's going to get my VOD muted. This is, okay, this is mute the VOD day. We got Lord of

47
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,009
the Rings music, Lord of the Rings fellowship of the ring in the background. We've got a hype train

48
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,250
getting on the ride again and it's going to complete and it's going to keep going.

49
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,290
We like to party. We like to party more. I can't even fucking keep up, man. This is insane.

50
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:12,649
Oh my fucking God. Get out of that hype train. Hey, Eleanor, $50. I like this video game. Thanks

51
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:36,250
for the 5,000 bits. Thanks for completing the hype train. Should I just play the song?

52
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:42,569
Should I just play this song and that's it? And that's what we do. And we just ride the hype

53
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:53,110
train and then we get off. It's too loud. All right. Hold on. Let me just be very, very... Did

54
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:03,740
somebody say that the Venga Boys was too loud? The Venga Boys are only allowed to be played at an

55
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:13,189
audio level of at least seven out of 10. If you play the Venga Boys under a five out of 10 in volume,

56
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:25,189
your computer explodes. It's like Speed, the movie with Keanu Reeves. A hundred dB.

57
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:33,000
Anyways, we did it. You did it again. You did it again. You did it again. You fucking... You blew

58
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,320
through another like three, five hundred subs or whatever it was. What is it? Let's just see

59
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:48,970
what it completes. It tells us. Play the song. You're getting the song. Actually, this is kind

60
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:57,700
of the royalty-free version of fellowship of the ring, isn't it? It is. This is not really fellowship

61
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:06,659
of the ring. So now I understand why I can play it. Where's Jon Snow? Wrong franchise. You're

62
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:22,600
thinking of a game of thrones. Where's Jon Snow? Toss a coin to the streamer. Oh my fucking God.

63
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:37,850
Another 5,000 bits from numb legs. They say hype in all capitals. Fucking... I'm making that

64
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:47,129
goddamn movie. I'm making that movie. Here's the part about this though. The projects that

65
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:57,080
are in the pipeline now became... I just fed all of my Pokemon that magic fruit that makes them

66
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,360
all stronger. I've got like 10 Pokemon in my Pokedex thing and I just gave them all the magic

67
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,759
fruit that makes them like 20% stronger, whatever it is. What's it called? Rare Candy. That's right.

68
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,309
You guys just gave Rare Candy to the four projects that are coming up in the next three,

69
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:26,360
four months. There it is. You achieved a hype level of level five. You did it. Let's get the

70
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:38,100
Vanga Boys on here to show just how fucking hype that was. 129 subs, 23,000 bits. Jesus Christ,

71
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:49,509
guys. In the first 10 minutes of the stream. You guys are too much. Thanks for sprinkling

72
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:55,350
Rare Candy all over all my fucking Pokemon videos that are coming out. Or streams, you know.

73
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,279
Anyway, let's play Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring. We'll go over all those at the end

74
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:14,779
of the stream like we always do, but holy shit. Hype is over. Back to sleep. New game. Lord of

75
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:25,559
the Rings. Okay, I was gonna say hopefully it doesn't hang. He's playing a game. Wake me up,

76
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:32,200
but he's not. We're gonna get a cutscene I think here. Is it the actors? Is it the original actors?

77
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:56,870
We'll find out. Hello? It's the old PlayStation 2 buzzing sound. Here we go.

78
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,480
That's the Harry Potter memory thing.

79
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,730
In the shadows of Morgdor, the Dark Lord Sauron forged the one ring to enslave all elves,

80
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:20,230
dwarves, and men of Middle-earth. The three people of Middle-earth overthrew Sauron,

81
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:32,009
but lost the ring. Now the enemy has returned, and from his dark tower in Morgdor,

82
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:38,809
he seeks his ring. We must find the ring first and destroy it. Who is that supposed to be?

83
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,950
Don't- I should know this.

84
00:12:50,440 --> 00:13:03,210
Dendril? Dendril? Gabriel? No, not Gabriel. Gala- Gala- Gala-Leo. I don't know that- I don't

85
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:09,850
know. I'm such a fucking shitty fan. I don't know her name. Not Gandalf. Why are there no subtitles?

86
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:22,340
Gala-Dreel. Welcome back, Gandalf. Will we have fireworks, elvish lessons,

87
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,740
tales of ancient Numenor? Today, we must talk about a shadow of the past.

88
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,779
The ring you inherited may be very dangerous. Is that Ian Kellan? Uncle Bilbo's magic ring?

89
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:40,019
Magic rings, as you call them, were made by elves. But this ring, I think, was made by another.

90
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,909
Give me the ring. That looks like the Christian Bible game show host.

91
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,529
See, Frodo, it was that easy. You just gotta toss it into some fire.

92
00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:03,929
Let me save you 16 hours worth of movie. I see fine lines, lines of fire, in a flowing script.

93
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:11,610
What does it say? One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all,

94
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,490
and in the darkness, bind them. This is the one ring to rule them all.

95
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:25,769
The ancient kings of elves, dwarves, and men use the rings of power to rule their lands.

96
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,009
See, I don't have to pay attention to this cutscene, because I already, like,

97
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:33,289
know this. Oh, dude, pay attention to the cutscene. Everyone's seen this movie.

98
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:38,259
A strange creature called Gollum found the ring and was corrupted by it.

99
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:45,220
Bilbo won it from Gollum, and now it is yours. But the lord of the rings has returned,

100
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,779
and all his thought is bent on finding the ring.

101
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:56,019
Let's destroy it. It can only be destroyed when it was forged, in Mount Doom, the fire mountain in

102
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:04,100
Lorda. Take it there, take it. No, do not tempt me. If I bore the ring, I would become the Dark Lord

103
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,340
Gandalf. It's not like a piece of chocolate while you're on a diet.

104
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:20,360
I'm a danger to the Shire. I must leave. I could set out on the road just like Bilbo.

105
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:27,820
My dear Frodo, hobbits really are amazing creatures. But you need not go alone. If there

106
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,340
are any you can trust. But take care. The enemy has many spies.

107
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:39,110
Uh-oh. What was in the window? I didn't look in the window. Did you look in the window?

108
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,559
What? Well then. Samwise Gamgee, isn't it?

109
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,169
Don't hurt me. What are you doing at Bag End?

110
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,649
Nothing, sir. Trimming the grass under the window.

111
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:58,169
Oh? The sound of Shire stopped some time ago.

112
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:02,330
Bootleg Lord of the Rings. We're just watching the Lord of the Rings on stream.

113
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,450
Finally. I get to live my fucking fantasy.

114
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:13,159
What have you heard? Oh, Frodo, don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.

115
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,399
He won't hurt you. Just answer his question.

116
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,879
Well, I heard a lot. I didn't understand about lords and rings in the fiery mountain.

117
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,360
And elves, sir. I had to listen. I dearly love to see elves.

118
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:30,100
Were they? Keep it a secret, Sam.

119
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,899
Or I hope Gandalf turned you into a spotted toad.

120
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,980
I've thought of something better.

121
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,940
Why don't they shave their feet?

122
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,779
You will go away with you, Frodo.

123
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,779
Me, sir? I don't understand.

124
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,659
Go and see elves and all. Hooray!

125
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,700
But where should we go?

126
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,059
Towards danger, but not too rashly.

127
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,980
Just grab like a wax strip and just-

128
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,139
Take time to settle your affairs before you leave.

129
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,860
I could leave in autumn, on my birthday.

130
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:57,620
Very well, but no later.

131
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,779
How come there wasn't like a 40-year-old virgin

132
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,859
part of these movies where Frodo gets like his feet waxed and he's like,

133
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,779
Oh, I'm killing Ornstein!

134
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:08,819
Every time they rip it off.

135
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,099
I'll have to sell Bag End.

136
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,099
The Sackville Bagginses have been trying to take over this place for years.

137
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,940
A shame to let them have it.

138
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,859
Indeed. And now I must go. I have much to attend to.

139
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,220
As do I.

140
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,660
That would ruin these fucking movies.

141
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,220
That would ruin everything.

142
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,859
They would not get nominated for any Academy Awards across the entire three movies.

143
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:35,940
Oh, yes. Not a word from Sam Gamgee, and that's for certain.

144
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,579
Once you leave, travel as Mr. Underhill.

145
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:41,940
The name of Baggins is not synced outside the Shire.

146
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,339
And do not use the ring, for it can corrupt the most innocent heart.

147
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,700
I understand.

148
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:51,779
Gandalf, how do you use a ring?

149
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,430
You just paused on it.

150
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,710
I'm going to see elves.

151
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,309
Farewell, Frodo. I'll return by your birthday.

152
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,109
Oh, my birthday?

153
00:18:03,109 --> 00:18:05,509
I'm going to get Gandalfs coming to my birthday party.

154
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,829
As the nights grew longer, I decided I might have to leave the house.

155
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:10,150
You're not coming to your birthday party.

156
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,670
On the morning of my birthday, September 22nd,

157
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,630
I set out for one final stroll around the Shire.

158
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,430
I had to say farewell to my neighbors and sell my home to the Bees Sackville Baggins.

159
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,309
Scroll back up. What?

160
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,109
He's coming to my birthday. That's my birthday.

161
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:39,619
Gandalf, just come to my fucking birthday party.

162
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,740
Not yours.

163
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:49,849
He could be making it up, though.

164
00:18:52,069 --> 00:18:52,710
All right, let's go.

165
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,619
Happy birthday. Gandalf's coming to my birthday party.

166
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,619
Oh, I have to get ready.

167
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:10,420
You picked a Bag End key. Get the key to Bag End.

168
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,740
Press and hold R2 to view Frodo's inventory.

169
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,339
Use the left analog stick to scroll through Frodo's inventory.

170
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,579
Walking stick.

171
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,819
Oh, you can punch and you can hit.

172
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:34,259
All right, so I got the key to Bag End.

173
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,619
Anything else I need to do?

174
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,150
Stick in Bag End.

175
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:48,650
Shut up.

176
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,880
All right, let's go. I got the key.

177
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,589
Wait, I don't want to miss any secrets.

178
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,269
Hey, by the way, what qualifies as the first part of Lord of the Rings?

179
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,789
Fellowship of the Ring.

180
00:20:08,069 --> 00:20:08,950
Getting out of the house here.

181
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,789
This is the first level is getting out of the house.

182
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,039
Find the deed to Bag End before leaving.

183
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,599
Oh, shit.

184
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,589
Is there a sprint?

185
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,650
Fucking ugly ass game.

186
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,859
Yes, I know it is PlayStation 2.

187
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:50,180
I know.

188
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,900
But it's pretty ugly.

189
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,700
He's gonna quit it.

190
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,819
He's gonna quit.

191
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,779
Oh, no.

192
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:58,140
No, I'm not gonna quit.

193
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,539
I can't.

194
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,130
Bring us in this chest.

195
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,289
I best leave it here until I sell Bag End.

196
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:04,410
He sells his house?

197
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,970
I don't...

198
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,849
Wait, hold on.

199
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:12,890
Frodo sells his house in Fellowship of the Ring?

200
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,569
Where's the deed to the house?

201
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,009
You never watched the movie.

202
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:20,569
Yes, I did.

203
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:23,289
I don't remember them being on a house sale.

204
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,339
You didn't read the books.

205
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,319
No, I didn't read the books.

206
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,240
Because...

207
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,700
Where's his deed?

208
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:46,970
The movies were so good that I couldn't read the books.

209
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,529
Okay?

210
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:48,329
I'll be...

211
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:48,890
I'm gonna be honest.

212
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,690
The movies were too good.

213
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,890
So I could not read the books.

214
00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:06,359
Hold on a second.

215
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,480
Let me just do something here.

216
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,000
I think I can turn the brightness up a little bit or something.

217
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,720
Something's wrong.

218
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,400
It looks like shitty, crusty.

219
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,599
I think that just might be the game.

220
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,720
Let me see if I can tweak this.

221
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,769
I'm not cheating.

222
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:36,470
All right, here we go.

223
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,289
Is that better or worse?

224
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,009
I can't even tell.

225
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:42,809
That's like worse.

226
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,420
Wait, oh, there we go.

227
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,369
That's a little better.

228
00:22:51,369 --> 00:23:01,609
Is it worse?

229
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:07,130
Do we saturate the colors a little more?

230
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,900
All right, now we're looking okay.

231
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,299
Now it doesn't look like total dog shit.

232
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:20,549
Have you dropped the contrast a little?

233
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,079
Put the gamut down.

234
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:27,140
Gamut down, sharpness up, brightness up.

235
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,940
I don't have access to those.

236
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,549
That looks better.

237
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,430
That looks all right right there.

238
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,059
Looks like I put the ring on.

239
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,519
All right, let me walk around for a second.

240
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,099
Oh yeah, that's like a thousand times better.

241
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,740
Before it was like I hurt my head.

242
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:57,420
That's so much better.

243
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:06,259
All right, let's close this back down.

244
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,940
Am I playing this in a bathtub?

245
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,170
Yes.

246
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,869
Yes, I'm in a bathtub right now.

247
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,309
I'm playing in a bathtub.

248
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:17,190
I bathe and play.

249
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,630
That's how I game.

250
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,309
That's how you know that I take it dead seriously.

251
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:23,670
Oh, oh, by the question.

252
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,289
I was scared to do this and I didn't know.

253
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,240
Okay, let me ask.

254
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,119
This is a real question.

255
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,519
Because how does electricity even work?

256
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,480
So if I bring, let's say for instance,

257
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,680
if somebody was to hypothetically,

258
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
if you would like to be in a bathtub, right?

259
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,759
Like if you're taking a bath and you want to,

260
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,839
oh, I have like my phone with me

261
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,440
or my iPad, right?

262
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,579
If you have your iPad in the bath,

263
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:54,819
if you drop the iPad into the bathtub,

264
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,740
is it going to electrocute you?

265
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:02,589
No, right?

266
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,980
No, because there's no current.

267
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:14,250
That's, there has to be a current.

268
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,980
Yeah, because there's no like current to let go.

269
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,640
Yeah, okay.

270
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,839
Oh, that's correct.

271
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:25,900
Yeah, because I was taking a bath and I was like,

272
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,859
I want to use my iPad.

273
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,980
But if I like slip and drop the iPad into the bath,

274
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,140
am I going to get like fucking killed?

275
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:33,740
I was scared.

276
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,700
The amperage is too low.

277
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,710
I don't know.

278
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,549
It's like, okay, what if you dropped it?

279
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:50,069
Listen, what if, okay, an iPad won't do it.

280
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:54,789
But what if you had like a big fucking like Alienware laptop

281
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,549
that has like an i7 in it?

282
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,869
And it's like a $3,000 laptop.

283
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:00,309
If you dropped it into the bathtub,

284
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,529
would that still do it?

285
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,029
No.

286
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:15,789
Okay.

287
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,160
Where's this deed?

288
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,319
Where's this deed so I can tell this person

289
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,200
that I beat the first part?

290
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,799
All right, I'm going to check every fucking room.

291
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,289
We're at the end of the hallway.

292
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,970
This way.

293
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,059
Okay, is it in here?

294
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,000
In the dining room.

295
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,269
Not in the dining room.

296
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,190
Nothing sparkly to look at.

297
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,900
There's nothing in here.

298
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,400
Okay.

299
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:56,819
Next room.

300
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,579
This one right here.

301
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,400
No deed.

302
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,460
No deed.

303
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,339
Okay, found the deed.

304
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,980
Complete.

305
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,480
I got it.

306
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,049
Hey, hey, fake Grumbo, if you're here.

307
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,210
I'm about to fucking yell your name really loud.

308
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:28,859
I actually can't get out of the house.

309
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,299
Hey, I beat the first.

310
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,500
This is not the first level, never mind.

311
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,390
Imagine dropping a whole laptop in the bath.

312
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,670
What's with the flame?

313
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,589
There's like weird scan lines right now.

314
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:50,650
Do you see that?

315
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,240
The Shire.

316
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,759
Press triangle to talk to others.

317
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,279
Good morning to you, Mr. Frodo.

318
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,720
Good morning, Sam.

319
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,480
All ready to set out for Buckland?

320
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,279
Already?

321
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,440
Or will be as soon as I tend to Bag End.

322
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,240
Lobelia Sackville Baggins is buying the place.

323
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,720
You don't need to weed Bag End ever again.

324
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,079
I'd like to weed them Sackville Bagginses out of Bag End.

325
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,119
If you get my meaning.

326
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:20,619
What?

327
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,599
Bag End has the best garden in the Shire, thanks to your work.

328
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,640
Oh, no, I'm sure there are many finer.

329
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,079
This game is dated as fuck.

330
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,920
Mary Brandybuck said he was meeting Pippin Took at the Green Dragon and invited you to join.

331
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
They took a long walk out here just for a drink.

332
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,640
This game sucks, actually, is what you-

333
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,920
Begging your pardon, sir.

334
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,559
But there's little mischief to be found in the Green Dragon.

335
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,000
The Keeper won't stand for it.

336
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,640
We will see.

337
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,799
Wait, but hold on a minute.

338
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:48,299
I'm-

339
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,380
What a pretty bird.

340
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,880
What?

341
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:00,470
The two towers is like one of the best games ever made.

342
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,029
What happened?

343
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:08,220
I'll be here when these pumpkins get turned into pies.

344
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:09,900
More's the pity.

345
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,779
I hate this camera.

346
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:11,579
It's so stupid.

347
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,700
Okay, let's keep going.

348
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:24,759
Number three, Bag Shot Row.

349
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,880
Home of the Ganges.

350
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,960
We'll send this hit as much-

351
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,240
No, I can't.

352
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,440
I can't, I can't.

353
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,240
I'm not stopping.

354
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,920
Mushroom.

355
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,160
Frodo can eat mushrooms to restore his health.

356
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,599
Okay.

357
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:45,160
Hi, Milo.

358
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,519
Hello, Frodo.

359
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,119
Seen any elves lately?

360
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,279
I'm afraid not, I'm sorry to say.

361
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,559
What about trolls?

362
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,839
No trolls either.

363
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,559
Good.

364
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,880
It's about time you found your hobbit sense again.

365
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,720
You know, some say you're as mad as your uncle.

366
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,039
Carrying on with an old wizard-

367
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,400
And to complete the first mission.

368
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,200
I know, that's the-

369
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,079
I'm gonna-

370
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,880
Well, at least they have something interesting to talk about then.

371
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,359
Good day.

372
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,720
Somebody fucking guaranteed that I wouldn't do the first level.

373
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,000
They guaranteed it.

374
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,359
I can't let that person win.

375
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:21,779
Where do I go?

376
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,140
I gotta go find Marion Pippin.

377
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,240
What is it?

378
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,200
By the garden or something?

379
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,109
Howlfast Hornblower, number six.

380
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:43,000
These people's names are out here?

381
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,400
You probably should have let them win.

382
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:53,609
No.

383
00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:02,460
Is there a game here?

384
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,779
Or do I just have to play as a hobbit?

385
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,579
Don't we traverse mountains and shit?

386
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,539
Isn't that like big battle sequences?

387
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,819
What happened in the first movie?

388
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:23,480
Right, hold on, here we go.

389
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,730
Hello, Ted.

390
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,410
I wanted to say goodbye before I-

391
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,170
Can't you see I'm busy?

392
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,970
Actually, no.

393
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,890
You seem to be just standing about.

394
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,890
Well, if you knew about mills,

395
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,690
you'd know I'm trying to locate a very important metal pin

396
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,609
that must have fallen out of my mill wheel.

397
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,130
Is that why the mill isn't working?

398
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:43,529
I have to-

399
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,890
Oh, never you mind about working or not working.

400
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,609
I've sent Mugwort to Brie for a replacement.

401
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:50,490
I thought I-

402
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,970
Wait, I have to go get-

403
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,490
If I haven't found it yet,

404
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,650
there's no way you can find it.

405
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,089
Metal pin next to the-

406
00:31:58,089 --> 00:31:59,769
It looks like a plain metal pin.

407
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:01,369
Now, good day to you.

408
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:07,420
Holy shit.

409
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Imagine having a movie that was made with like 150 to what?

410
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
200 million dollars.

411
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,799
And your tie-in video game for one of the most celebrated franchises

412
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,799
ever in the history of human cinema and human literature

413
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,920
is find the pin to the fucking watermill.

414
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,799
All right, where's that mill?

415
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,960
This isn't based on the movie.

416
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:51,450
It's not?

417
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:55,210
Yes, it is.

418
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:00,089
Official game based on the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien.

419
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,529
I call bullshit on that because look at the costumes.

420
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:05,539
This is the same-

421
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:08,980
Like, this is Peter Jackson costume design and-

422
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,299
What?

423
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:16,859
Like, Peter Jackson designed this cape.

424
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,289
What do you mean?

425
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,009
No, it's not.

426
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:21,769
That's Ian McKellen's Gandalf.

427
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:29,750
No.

428
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,990
What?

429
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,589
The costumes are described in the books.

430
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:33,430
No, I'm telling you.

431
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,069
We're gonna get-

432
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:34,789
I'm telling you, though.

433
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:36,230
This is based on the fucking movie.

434
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,779
This-

435
00:33:41,579 --> 00:33:42,059
Bullshit.

436
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,279
Fellowship of the Ring.

437
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,000
When did it come out?

438
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:48,980
What?

439
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,819
You just magically decided to-

440
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:56,099
Oh, you just magically, less than six months later after the movie comes out,

441
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,420
you decide we're gonna make a game based on the literary works of the Fellowship of the Ring

442
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,980
four and a half months after the fucking movie comes out.

443
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:03,940
Bullshit.

444
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:18,099
You can't develop a game in six months.

445
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,940
All right, one guy's not winning.

446
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:21,989
I'm going to do this right now.

447
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,650
Peter Jackson based the film on this game.

448
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,300
I have to-

449
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,340
All right, let's go.

450
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,980
Come on.

451
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,500
I have to get to the first level.

452
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,380
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

453
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,880
I refuse.

454
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,440
This is why they said it.

455
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,280
It had nothing to do with the game being hard.

456
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,599
Fuck.

457
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:47,480
I thought it was like,

458
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
dude, the game's too hard for you.

459
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,360
Like, the combo meter, you're gonna fuck it up.

460
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,880
Like, that's in the second and third game.

461
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,199
I get it now.

462
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,079
Now I know why he said that.

463
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,719
I just skipped dialogue in the first-

464
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,920
All right, let's go.

465
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,400
Get high.

466
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,039
Ah, yes, my favorite Lord of the Rings character.

467
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:18,599
Minto!

468
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,059
Yes, I know.

469
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:22,460
This is-

470
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:24,059
It's okay.

471
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,710
You're right.

472
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,429
Yeah, Minto.

473
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:28,550
This part's not even in the movie.

474
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:29,750
Got it.

475
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,289
Wait.

476
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:44,250
This is my house.

477
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:53,210
Where are you going?

478
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,570
I don't know.

479
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,730
I have to go find Marion Pippen in the garden.

480
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,329
Where's the garden?

481
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:05,210
Fellowship of the fucking Ring.

482
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,090
Oh, I found the well.

483
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,840
Ladders can be climbed.

484
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,679
I wonder how many lucky wishing stones are at the bottom of this well.

485
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,239
Oh, I wonder how quickly my legs would break

486
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,159
if I would have fucking fall straight down to the bottom.

487
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:19,800
How do I do it?

488
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:33,130
Brodo can grab ledges and hoist himself onto them.

489
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:33,929
Jump to what?

490
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:34,329
There's a-

491
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,119
Okay, well, that worked.

492
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,940
Got default pig sound.

493
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,579
That's pretty hype.

494
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:44,760
Okay, wait.

495
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,000
What?

496
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,599
There's only a mushroom up here?

497
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,210
This is a bootleg copy?

498
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,090
No, no.

499
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,449
This is a real copy.

500
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,139
The game was just not-

501
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:02,650
No fucking way.

502
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,130
No.

503
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,690
Yes way.

504
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:06,489
What does this have on, like, ratings?

505
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,760
All right.

506
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,639
If I just splatted and I died and I got a game over screen,

507
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,760
that would have been very, very funny.

508
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,809
Click the link.

509
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:21,449
Omega low.

510
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,010
Click the link.

511
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,570
Omega low.

512
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,050
Click the link.

513
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,869
All right.

514
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:25,190
Hold on.

515
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,590
What is it?

516
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,530
Hobbit Day.

517
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,610
Hobbit Day is the name used for September 20th,

518
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,130
a reference to being the birthday of the hobbits.

519
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:43,590
I can't even-

520
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,469
How am I supposed to say about this?

521
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,389
I can't even combat this.

522
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:49,110
It's not fair.

523
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:50,710
It's not fair.

524
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,300
That's not fair.

525
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,579
That's not fair.

526
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,630
And it's not-

527
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,510
That's not fair.

528
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,110
Life isn't fair.

529
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,610
Okay?

530
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:08,309
Wax you-

531
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:09,190
How hairy are they?

532
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,440
They're a little hairy.

533
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,400
They're a little hairy.

534
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:28,280
Oh, show, show.

535
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,320
You think I'm gonna get baited?

536
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:32,380
What?

537
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,420
You think I'm gonna get baited

538
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,280
to like be in somebody's permanent folder on their desktop?

539
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,199
Oh, dude.

540
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:46,920
Yeah, you should show-

541
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,440
Oh, I wonder how hairy they are.

542
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:48,840
Click that.

543
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,320
Click that.

544
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,559
Yes.

545
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:50,840
Yes, I got it.

546
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,440
Oh, yes.

547
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:53,780
Okay.

548
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,099
Okay.

549
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:54,420
Hold on.

550
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,460
Calm down.

551
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,739
Calm down, Frank.

552
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:57,380
Calm down, Frank.

553
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,099
You just got it.

554
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,059
Okay.

555
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,940
Now save permanently to computer.

556
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,059
Okay.

557
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:03,860
Save permanently.

558
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,030
Make two copies of it.

559
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,349
Okay.

560
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,590
Oh, yes.

561
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,510
I can watch this every-

562
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,030
I can watch this every day.

563
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,469
I can watch it every single day.

564
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,760
Come on, get baited.

565
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,570
Sandieman's mill looks a lot more cheerful than Ted Sandieman.

566
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,010
Installing.

567
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,570
I don't-

568
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,849
Okay, where's the garden?

569
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:30,659
I don't care about these little quests.

570
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,179
I don't want to just go meet the other people in the movie.

571
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:35,139
In the book, whatever.

572
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:42,570
Oh, Mary and Pippin are in the garden.

573
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:42,809
What?

574
00:39:42,809 --> 00:39:43,769
Where's the garden?

575
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:44,329
What garden?

576
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:49,539
And where was this?

577
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,139
The metal stick I have to find?

578
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:55,539
I don't even have a map either.

579
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:03,429
This is the-

580
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:04,789
I'm about to grapple.

581
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:11,340
Okay.

582
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,300
Why do I keep hearing cat puke noises?

583
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,699
I don't know.

584
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,250
Guys, I don't think you understand.

585
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,530
What's the over-under on like the-

586
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,489
Oh, dude, like show-

587
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:33,929
Hey, sweat check.

588
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:34,570
Sweat check.

589
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,090
Oh, yeah, let's do a sweat check.

590
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,889
Hey, got it.

591
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:39,130
What's the over-under?

592
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:47,929
Do the game.

593
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,820
There's a garden right here.

594
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:13,940
Oh, no.

595
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,670
Let's go.

596
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:19,699
Why can't I talk?

597
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,630
Will we be off to see the elves soon, Frodo?

598
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,750
Soon, Sam.

599
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,670
I have a few things to take care of first.

600
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,230
God damn it.

601
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,909
I can't let this person be right.

602
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,440
I guarantee.

603
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,519
I guarantee you not gonna get to the first-

604
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,639
through the first part.

605
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,440
A fellowship of the regular PlayStation 2.

606
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,119
Guaranteed.

607
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:46,920
Fucking-

608
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,519
They can't be right.

609
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,639
They can't be right.

610
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,679
They can't be right.

611
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,280
They can't be right.

612
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, there's-

613
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,960
They can't be right.

614
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,519
I can't.

615
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:57,880
You can't win.

616
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,480
I can't win.

617
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,800
I have to find a metal stick

618
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:08,489
next to the old water mill.

619
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:10,809
But where is the old water mill?

620
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:11,849
He said, you'll never find it.

621
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,769
You're never gonna find the metal pin needed for this.

622
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,369
I guarantee it.

623
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:19,449
He looks right in the fucking camera and winks at you guys.

624
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:26,070
Hello there, Hal.

625
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,829
Oh, hello, Frodo.

626
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,750
You have a beautiful day to begin your trip to Crick Hollow.

627
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,869
Yes, indeed.

628
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:35,590
I'm too old for such long walks.

629
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,710
I can't even climb high enough to fix my weather vane.

630
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,110
No.

631
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,309
What's wrong with it?

632
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,750
The thing's stuck.

633
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,949
Sorry to hear it.

634
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:47,190
That rascal Sancho Proudfoot was throwing sticks at it.

635
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,789
Now it won't turn at all.

636
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:50,389
I'll take a look at it before I leave.

637
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:51,670
All right, I just threw up.

638
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,469
It's been 45 minutes.

639
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,269
I have to fucking do this now.

640
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:54,630
The ladder's right over there.

641
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,230
Ladder, let's go.

642
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,619
Throw a rock at it.

643
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,119
What?

644
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,769
Let's go.

645
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:13,699
Enter target mode, press L2, and use the analog stick to aim.

646
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,659
I'm not tall enough to aim at this.

647
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:24,159
Wait.

648
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:29,530
How do I throw a rock?

649
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:36,519
I don't have any rocks.

650
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:51,849
Where do I get a rock?

651
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:54,869
I don't have rocks.

652
00:43:55,429 --> 00:43:57,699
Is there a rock like right next to it or something?

653
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,369
Throw a rock?

654
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:10,059
Did he?

655
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:10,539
Wait a minute.

656
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,659
There's just rocks just sitting right next to it or something.

657
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:26,869
There's one where?

658
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,630
I have to find a rock and come back here and throw it.

659
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,739
Holy shit.

660
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:37,539
Follow the road.

661
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:49,559
Please, for the love of God, go to the next area.

662
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,519
Okay, find a rock and find the pin.

663
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:03,610
Can't Gandalf just fucking help me do this?

664
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,500
Gandalf is waiting at the end of the road.

665
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,659
Who's taking this little shit so long?

666
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,860
I've got places to be.

667
00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:24,409
Should have left it to a dwarf instead.

668
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:25,530
All right, seriously.

669
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:26,090
Where's the rock?

670
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,650
This is...

671
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,289
I don't understand.

672
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:37,059
Don't...

673
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:38,260
Stop walking in circles.

674
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,940
There is nowhere else to go.

675
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,090
Guy!

676
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,570
There's nowhere else to go.

677
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:54,869
Minto is a minor character.

678
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:55,349
I don't...

679
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:56,150
I don't care.

680
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:03,739
I need to find a rock and the pin and...

681
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:09,110
This book sucks.

682
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,860
This book sucks.

683
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:20,710
Garden...

684
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,300
If there's an item on the ground that's able to be picked up, it glows.

685
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:29,139
Stay on the road, Jerma.

686
00:46:29,139 --> 00:46:29,619
Stay on the road.

687
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:30,260
Stay on the road.

688
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,219
Okay, I'm going to stay on the road.

689
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:32,019
Only on road.

690
00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:32,420
Only.

691
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,710
Here we are again.

692
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,480
Wait.

693
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:10,230
Guys leave?

694
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,369
Oh, I thought I had to do the quests.

695
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,699
You just walk out.

696
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:32,139
I thought it was like, oh, find my...

697
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,670
I just beat the first level.

698
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:44,460
The Shire.

699
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,019
By water.

700
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:49,750
Holy fuck.

701
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,949
I can't believe I just did that.

702
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:52,230
I thought I had to do all that stuff.

703
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,469
Turns out I didn't.

704
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:55,670
Was that all just a joke?

705
00:47:56,389 --> 00:48:11,539
I'm going to be realistic with you guys.

706
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:18,389
Do you honestly think a hobbit with a stick is going to do a goddamn thing?

707
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,130
Give me a knife or something.

708
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,489
Or give me like a gun.

709
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:25,449
Give me something sharp.

710
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,489
A hobbit with a stick.

711
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,400
That's not going to do anything.

712
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:36,119
Or like a bow.

713
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:36,440
I don't know.

714
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,840
Anything.

715
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:49,079
I don't know.

716
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:49,559
Will I?

717
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,280
Stay on the road.

718
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,199
What about the guy playing chess?

719
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,719
Hello, young Baggins.

720
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:55,639
Cheers on your birthday.

721
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:57,239
Thank you kindly, Daddy Two-Foot.

722
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:58,440
I haven't seen your wizard friend about lately.

723
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,199
Daddy Two-Foot.

724
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:02,440
I do miss those fireworks.

725
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,320
So do I.

726
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,719
I remember the day when all those dwarves came to call on Mr. Bilbo.

727
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,639
Dwarves and a wizard.

728
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,280
I'm sorry.

729
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,480
It's automatic.

730
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,039
I have to do it.

731
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:16,440
Such strange stories these days.

732
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,760
Long dead better whites waking near the old forest.

733
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,639
Great armies in the east and south.

734
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:25,000
Dwarves and big.

735
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,239
All right.

736
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:26,039
That's enough out of you.

737
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:26,440
Don't care.

738
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:29,960
Ring the bell.

739
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,460
What's going on?

740
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,539
I don't hold with reckless bell ringing.

741
00:49:36,539 --> 00:49:40,940
Oh, if any wolves approach the Shire, the bounders will chase them off.

742
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,019
Just as they chase away foxes and such.

743
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,019
I'm glad the Shire is well protected.

744
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:49,019
Now, if that's all, I've got a mug to return to in the green dragon.

745
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:49,260
Okay.

746
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:50,539
All right.

747
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:50,780
Bye.

748
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,059
Okay, Gandalf.

749
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:52,380
I'm ready.

750
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:55,300
Okay.

751
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,179
Hey, Gandalf.

752
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:56,659
I'm ready.

753
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:07,239
This is the way that I came.

754
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:14,460
No.

755
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,179
Yes.

756
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,139
Is it the way that I came?

757
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:19,769
He's so bad.

758
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,050
What a little dick boy.

759
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:23,849
All right, dude.

760
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:24,809
No.

761
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:33,030
Did I come this way?

762
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:35,420
I did.

763
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:35,920
Didn't I?

764
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:39,159
Yeah, I did.

765
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,900
No, I didn't.

766
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:43,670
Wait, is this guy again?

767
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,710
Hello, Nox.

768
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,389
Good to see you up and about again.

769
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:47,829
Hi, thank you.

770
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:49,590
I'm fit as a horse again.

771
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,309
Folks will be calling me well-preserved like they do your uncle Bilbo.

772
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:56,469
That does kind of look like the German painting face.

773
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:59,110
Why, it's this new herbal tea I've been drinking.

774
00:50:59,110 --> 00:50:59,909
Good.

775
00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:02,150
Well, I'm off to my old bones.

776
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,670
It's that must be Nox.

777
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:04,550
I had perhaps I.

778
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:07,380
I don't care.

779
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,619
Find four healing herbs in Green Hill country.

780
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:11,619
For old Nox.

781
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:14,260
How about we find Gandalf?

782
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,380
The guy that I'm supposed to find.

783
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:31,989
You're ignoring side quests.

784
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,139
Why would I do the side quests in this game?

785
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:47,739
The Shire.

786
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:49,099
Green Hill country.

787
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,260
Okay, what we got?

788
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,059
When are we going to get to hear the?

789
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:00,619
Here's one of those packets of herbs Nox spoke on.

790
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:01,119
Great.

791
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,659
Hello there.

792
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:07,539
Good day, lad.

793
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,119
Thank you.

794
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:10,840
Bilbo.

795
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,559
Frodo.

796
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,239
Frodo faggans.

797
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,480
Living that grand place atop the hill.

798
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,880
Frodo.

799
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,760
It's me Frodo.

800
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,719
Not Bilbo.

801
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:18,519
That's my dad.

802
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:18,920
Where?

803
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,960
Not time to chat.

804
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,159
I'm off to great.

805
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:21,719
On an Arab.

806
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:23,079
Uncle, uncle.

807
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:24,440
I know it's uncle.

808
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,940
Stop.

809
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,360
Thanks, Bilbo.

810
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,530
We need that meal and Ted says he's too important to go himself.

811
00:52:32,409 --> 00:52:34,880
Okay, bye.

812
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,570
Good devs.

813
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,369
Good devs.

814
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:06,090
Good devs.

815
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,889
Nice work, guys.

816
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,329
Give it up for devs.

817
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:08,829
Good devs.

818
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,150
Devs not in chat.

819
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:27,630
Oh.

820
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,719
Oh, shit.

821
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:34,599
Wait, I'm streaming a game and the dev is not here watching me stream.

822
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:43,079
Really?

823
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,070
How many viewers do I have?

824
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:47,739
I don't know.

825
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:48,380
I'm just saying.

826
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,420
What the fuck?

827
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,619
Why they're not here?

828
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:51,119
Okay.

829
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,489
Fuck.

830
00:53:53,030 --> 00:54:00,230
I'm like, I don't want to be annoyed by that, but I mean like, fuck.

831
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:05,960
Do not let pharma maggot's dog spot you.

832
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
Use rocks to distract the dog.

833
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,559
I'm not gonna throw rocks at a dog.

834
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:10,280
Where's this dog?

835
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:19,929
Woof.

836
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:21,130
What's all this racket?

837
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,769
That would be me, sir.

838
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:27,530
Well, well, we have a burglar in the fields.

839
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:28,409
Burglar?

840
00:54:28,409 --> 00:54:31,050
All done with your mushroom thieving?

841
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,250
Or would you prefer to take it up with the lads?

842
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,690
Are there police in this world?

843
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,570
Right, you are, sir.

844
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,289
Who are the police?

845
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:39,610
Now off with you, or I'll have the lads disperse you.

846
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,530
Is the lad supposed to be the police?

847
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,219
Okay.

848
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,219
Well, I'm stealing your mushrooms.

849
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,619
Don't let the dog see you.

850
00:54:53,179 --> 00:54:55,179
Okay, I'm not gonna, I'm gonna make sure the dog, there's a sneak.

851
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:01,349
Use rocks.

852
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:02,949
I don't fucking have rocks.

853
00:55:04,949 --> 00:55:06,550
Why does this game think I have rocks?

854
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,090
I don't have rocks.

855
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,840
Put the ring on.

856
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,639
Does he turn around?

857
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,059
I have rocks.

858
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:31,940
I don't have rocks?

859
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:50,090
Oh my god.

860
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:56,150
There are no rocks.

861
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,230
I don't have rocks.

862
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,110
They don't exist.

863
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,309
I don't have fucking rocks.

864
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:06,380
L2.

865
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,579
X.

866
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:07,980
Circle.

867
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:08,780
Y.

868
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,050
X.

869
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:15,929
Circle.

870
00:56:15,929 --> 00:56:16,170
Y.

871
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:16,809
It's circle.

872
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:28,150
What am I supposed to do with these?

873
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,960
Is the dog distracted?

874
00:56:59,019 --> 00:56:59,500
Stop.

875
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,539
Oh my god.

876
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,539
Turn around.

877
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:21,780
What?

878
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,019
He turned around for one second.

879
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:37,699
All right, hold on.

880
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:38,099
I'll get it.

881
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:56,039
Oh fuck, was he gone?

882
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:01,929

883
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:02,429
Get it!

884
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,360
Healing herb.

885
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,849
All right, I did it.

886
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,570
Go in the dog house?

887
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,619
I got it.

888
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,980
That's all I needed.

889
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,860
I wonder what broke this fence.

890
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,460
What broke this fence?

891
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,170
The fence is still fine.

892
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:42,260
How do I get in here?

893
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,699
There's a healing herb for grandpa.

894
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:51,940
Crawl.

895
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,389
How do you crawl?

896
00:58:54,949 --> 00:59:01,699
I don't think you can.

897
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,000
What the?

898
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:09,369
You don't have to be zoomed in for this.

899
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,460
There is no crawl.

900
00:59:16,099 --> 00:59:19,960
Maybe the other side?

901
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,880
Why does this look so blurry?

902
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,280
Well, because this game is from 20 plus years ago.

903
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:37,050
And it was not developed with any intention to ever have...

904
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,889
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

911
01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:06,460
That's one completed.

912
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,440
This is the end of the road though.

913
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,360
All right, I got the healing herbs.

914
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,119

01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:44,140
throw rocks at a guy's weather vane so this is added bonus material in fact

966
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,500
i'm sure a lot of you would probably like that if there was a bonus super extended edition

967
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,819
the lord of the rings fans would go fucking nuts if there was a two hour long segment

968
01:10:54,619 --> 01:11:09,300
of frodo just throwing rocks and stuff and picking up mushrooms the new bonus extended

969
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:15,050
extended edition it's six and a half hours long then it just you put the disc in and starts with

970
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:21,880
this screen where's this in no i've got the inn i gotta go to my i have to go to my house

972
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:54,340
all right give me my ring you've walked the area in circles for 40 minutes and you don't know the

973
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:59,859
layout oh we talked about this in pre-stream chat i'm gonna bring it up one more time here

974
01:12:00,979 --> 01:12:08,649
because it's worth noting um if the game has no this people can think i'm an idiot i'm not

975
01:12:08,649 --> 01:12:17,079
gonna say it if you're in pre-stream you know and any any pre-streamers here any pre-stream chatters

997
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,399
before it was even any good and then it became the best thing in the whole game and i quit world of

998
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:17,979
warcraft that's true that is a real statement arcane mage was dog shit they patched it made

999
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:22,220
it the best thing in the whole game and i quit world of warcraft and have never played since

1000
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:31,399

1003
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:04,199
that where that's the worst spell in the whole game does that spell still exist that's the worst

1004
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:16,060
spell in the entire game i just found it why did you want to do that because i was different

1005
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:21,909
and i people would say oh do you what dude they'd say spec and a whisper and i'd say

discipline they'd go lol and now we get blocked but i was like i'm fucking cool though i got power

to keep people like engaged so these motherfuckers just make you autoplay every single place you go

1349
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:13,670
rings and the battleship of the ring yeah see that's the real play you find a game

1350
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:21,379
that has nobody playing and even if you like you can have a really you could have a kind of sloppy

1351
02:31:21,379 --> 02:31:25,940
pb and it could be the world records and you just like fuck that well who the hell else is

1357
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:48,200
all right what do you think is a game that exists that if you just sort of beat it

1358
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:54,520
slightly quickly you would have the world record for the game should we try to figure that out

1359
02:32:55,159 --> 02:33:00,040
what if i found a game that nobody cared about and nobody played that i could actually just get be

1360
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:05,079
the world record holder because i beat it slightly faster than normal because i'm the only one that

1361
02:33:05,079 --> 02:33:27,159
cared the lord of the rings no i definitely that's not real all right super frog nancy drew

age friends or actually you know how this is more accurate you're playing an mmo you're really

1473
03:03:20,680 --> 03:03:25,079
desperately trying to play an mmo with three of your friends who just made new characters

1474
03:03:25,879 --> 03:03:30,819
and they don't know a goddamn thing about the fucking game and they're just watching you

1475
03:03:30,819 --> 03:03:40,920
destroy everything and they are just following you around yeah it's over here did you guys how

1476
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:47,799
many you guys have i have two oh i have all of them already oh i'm not gonna say that though how

1477
03:03:47,799 --> 03:03:53,799
many do you have three what about you four okay cool i have all 12 um i think i saw some more

1478
03:03:53,799 --> 03:04:01,530
over here yeah i i have six i i'm still i have so hard to find them you know over here come

1479
03:04:01,530 --> 03:04:14,790
over this way i think this i'm over here and you got that one friend that just keeps casting the

1480
03:04:14,790 --> 03:04:23,319
same buff and they're the healer it's like you've been buffed you had 58 minutes remaining from 60

1481
03:04:23,319 --> 03:04:30,920
minutes like oh that's not the heal you're doing the wrong button but i'm not gonna say anything

1482
03:04:40,090 --> 03:04:47,379
you get the one friend that dies in every fight every single fight and thank god that you decided

1483
03:04:47,379 --> 03:04:51,700
that you were going to play a character with a rez because if you didn't you would not be playing

1484
03:04:51,700 --> 03:05:03,430
with these friends without a doubt in your mind if you don't play a character that can take care

1485
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:19,510
of everybody you ain't playing your auto voice and your stupid voice are the same you implying

1486
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:36,969
that auto is stupid no i'm implying that auto is a dog the worst part about playing uh mmos

1487
03:05:36,969 --> 03:05:44,440
especially with people that don't really care is a lot of people just don't get it and a lot of

1488
03:05:44,440 --> 03:05:49,819
your friends will treat an mmo like they're playing a game of madden all right let's go

1489
03:05:49,819 --> 03:05:58,069
let's say let's go on a quest 30 minutes goes by all right that's kind of fun i gotta go though

1490
03:05:59,639 --> 03:06:07,379
okay yeah um that's not you can't really play for 30 minute you we just did one quest and

1491
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:11,299

1493
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:29,459
like 20 fucking levels higher than him so what you do is you make another character you make an alt

1494
03:06:29,459 --> 03:06:36,409
for your alt so you can continue to play and then pretend like you didn't play and log on the other

1495
03:06:36,409 --> 03:06:44,059
character that your friend was playing with and then eventually that second character you made

1496
03:06:44,059 --> 03:06:52,500
becomes your main character and your friend never plays again past level 12 and you knew that was

1497
03:06:52,500 --> 03:07:10,860

you are absolutely a thousand percent correct you should shred this game no i can't do that i can't

1531
03:13:33,159 --> 03:13:55,020
do that don't tell him to save it makes him more invested whoever keeps telling him to save there

03:14:09,850 --> 03:14:25,899
i'm done i promise i beat the first area i get to win i swear to god i promise this next area i'm

1534
03:14:25,899 --> 03:14:37,379
done with lord of the rings fellowship of the ring but aragon is next i don't think that's i'm

1535
03:14:37,379 --> 03:14:53,510
gonna die you have to beat this no nobody really actually wants me to do that i know it for a fact

1536
03:14:54,309 --> 03:15:07,379
i know it for a fact this is a chill game you know somebody just said this it is strangely

1537
03:15:07,379 --> 03:15:10,899
intriguing and it is like oddly calming to be playing this and just hanging out

1538
03:15:12,020 --> 03:15:16,979
play a good lord of the rings game i have all of them i have two towers i have return of the king

1539
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:29,620
have them both go to get just play two towers now but we don't know the story

1540
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:45,690
i'm as cautious about this place what about the hobbit game no far from the main road by my

1541
03:15:45,690 --> 03:15:51,690
reckoning splendid if we keep this pace we'll leave the barrow downs by sunset tomorrow not

1542
03:15:51,690 --> 03:15:57,450
soon enough for my liking i don't trust what's hiding in the fog on the barrel downs you don't

1543
03:15:57,450 --> 03:16:04,809
believe stories about all dead barrel whites not until today but tom said otherwise tom is the only

1544
03:16:05,290 --> 03:16:10,250
was there ever a tv show for lord of the rings he was here i'm surprised the answer is no

1545
03:16:10,250 --> 03:16:16,729
from outside outside what i wonder and whatever did he mean by eldest and why didn't he serve a

1546
03:16:16,729 --> 03:16:23,049
cartoon i could see a cartoon sausages i don't like spending the night among these burial stones

1547
03:16:23,049 --> 03:16:27,610
they look like giant teeth coming up from the ground if half the stories i've heard about

1548
03:16:27,610 --> 03:16:33,049
the barrel downs are true we'll need to keep a careful watch enough storytelling let's get to
