1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:09,640
Uh oh. Already? I just... I just started. Why would I be doing this?

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:21,620
Let's hope that was just a little bump. Weird, but anyways, hi guys.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:34,009
It's a clay... ooh. Uh oh. Classic Jerma stream, yeah. Well, hi everybody.

4
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm back. Just waiting to see if this is... I might have to change

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Twitch servers again. Am I gonna have to do that? I probably will.

6
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:04,439
Oh, this is really bad. What a good comeback after

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,719
a week of not streaming. And we got a lot to talk about too.

8
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:19,560
But anyways, hi. Uh, I have returned from about eight days of being absent.

9
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,239
Got a lot to talk about. There's a lot to do.

10
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:31,670
And hopefully we can straighten out the internet here for a minute.

11
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,430
Any news on the work that blored out? There's a lot of news. We got...

12
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,590
This stream is not even gonna be a stream. This is gonna be like a

13
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:48,280
news broadcast. So welcome back to the non-stream.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,189
And I want to play this game Space Engine because it's kind of one of those

15
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:58,150
experiences where you just can travel the universe.

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:06,180
So we can talk, travel the universe. I'm ready. What's wrong with Space Engine?

17
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,979
Is it bad? I heard it was pretty good. This was

18
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,479
highly requested. It was in the Jerma985 Discord

19
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,620
recommended channel. So I mean, come on. You don't think

20
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,490
that I'd look at that? Anyways, before we really get started,

21
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,810
there's a few things that need to be said.

22
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,889
First of all, God, I love you. Can we just say that?

23
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,259
I gotta like, I gotta soften the blow here. You know,

24
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:41,219
you're just fantastic. Hold on, did you do something with

25
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:46,250
your hair? It looks different today. I like it. It looks good.

26
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,969
Wait, did you get an A plus? Good. Good. If you got a B, that's fine

27
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,650
too. I don't care. As long as you try.

28
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,490
All right, now that I softened the blow, I softened you a little bit.

29
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:06,759
All right, here we go. Over the next two months or so,

30
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:13,990
I am going to be dialing back streams. Instead of four days a week,

31
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,189
probably going to be more like two or three days a week

32
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,020
for the next couple of months. And I'll tell you why.

33
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,460
The carnival stream, if you don't know what that is,

34
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,139
is pretty much getting into full motion here.

35
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:32,939
And this stream is going to be the biggest thing I've ever done.

36
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,770
And it's going to happen before the end of September.

37
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,530
We are trying our hardest. This is not going to be just a little

38
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,840
dunk tank stream. This is going to be an incredibly elaborate experience.

39
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,340
So I gotta put the time in necessary to get it done.

40
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,340
And there's a lot of potential travel back and forth from a few places

41
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,680
that I may or may not have to do over the next couple of months.

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,120
But streams are going to be, essentially I'm going to be splitting

43
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,159
time between live streaming and working on this project.

44
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,230
Because I'm going full speed ahead. As of like this next week,

45
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,889
I'm going to try to go full speed ahead, whatever it takes.

46
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:32,379
Also, also the green screen encore night is Saturday.

47
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:38,170
For those of you that don't know, we've been talking about it for a few weeks.

48
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:44,360
If you have something ready, there is a form

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,529
that you have to submit your video to. This is happening on Saturday, so if

50
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,230
you got something, you got to submit it here.

51
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,230
Please use this form to submit your green screen

52
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,310
encore video. It is not, oh video, I swallowed my tongue there.

53
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,790
That was like video it. I was just like fucking puked.

54
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,459
That was weird. Anyways, so when you submit your

55
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,980
green screen, I haven't been on stream for like a week, come on.

56
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,779
When you submit your green screen video, keep in mind it has to be

57
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,589
under three minutes. Try to get it under three minutes.

58
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:26,790
We are making exceptions for some pieces of content.

59
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,310
But for the main part, don't like just throw up like a 30 minute video.

60
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,540
It's not going to be shown. Also, not every video is going to be

61
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,620
shown. Instead of this being a six to seven

62
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,060
hour, almost every submission is accepted,

63
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,449
we're going to take like the top submissions, ones that the mod team

64
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,120
and me, I'll be involved in this process as well, we'll be picking them.

65
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,399
So we really want this to be just like an encore presentation with some

66
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,639
of the really good ones and not like a 400 video,

67
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:11,019
seven hour live stream. So I'm, when I say I'm involved too,

68
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,680
I'm not going to watch every single video before the stream, but we're

69
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
talking like if there's a case where I need to come in and take a look,

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,959
the mods are going to do a really good job of sifting through

71
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,610
whatever is submitted. Get your submission in

72
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:34,389
before tomorrow night. Try. If you don't get it done and it's like

73
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,430
Saturday morning and you're like just finishing something,

74
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,029
then you can still submit it. I think we don't really have

75
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:47,269
a hard, hard limit, but if you don't get your submission in by like Friday night,

76
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,699
Saturday morning, it's not going to happen. You know

77
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,100
what I'm saying? It just isn't. There's just no way we're going to be able to

78
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,060
get it in there that quickly. And this is not designed to be like

79
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,740
a scenario where, oh, hurry up and make something crazy. This is just for

80
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,100
if you had something already, if something was already done, or if

81
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,180
you were working on something and you didn't finish it, or you had a

82
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,300
couple videos, or one video. That's what this is for. This is

83
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,850
not another full-on movie night. It's an extra

84
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,759
night, if you know what I'm saying. And that's Saturday at the regular time.

85
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,939
So today, tomorrow, and into Saturday, we're going to do some other stuff.

86
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,060
Mario Maker comes out tomorrow. Mario Maker 2, right?

87
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,649
Maybe we'll play that. But tonight we're going to just play Space Engine

88
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,339
and talk about this stuff. Because there's a lot to talk about.

89
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,100
Wasn't there a third thing? What was the third thing?

90
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:50,420
What was the third thing? Anybody know what the third thing was? There was a

91
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:58,139
third thing. Shit. What was the third thing? There

92
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:07,899
was a third important thing. The carnival fucking twitch place

93
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,339
carnival stream. The fact that streams are going to be

94
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:14,949
pulled back a little bit over the next couple months.

95
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:22,629
Encore movie night. No, I'm not pregnant. It'll come to me.

96
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:28,069
Don't worry. Let's get this on here. And this is a tad loud, so we're

97
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:40,100
going to turn it down. He's trying. I'm not pregnant. If I'm

98
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,240
pregnant, then I get Disney World. I think that's good. Maybe a little

99
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,240
more. Should we do it at one? I think that's all right. That sounds

100
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:58,730
okay. We can turn it up. I have no idea what's going to happen in this game. All

101
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,940
I know is we're going to just browse around.

102
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,779
How did you not use... Oh, I was going to read that out loud.

103
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,419
All right. I haven't played it yet, so I don't know what I'm

104
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:15,559
continuing. I'm going to take you guys to my

105
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:33,210
house. This is like Google Earth. What planet is this? So this is

106
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:43,909
Earth? What the fuck happened? What year is this? This is like 2845?

107
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:49,590
This is all fucking like toxic. Oh, I don't even want to know what the

108
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,779
fuck happened here. Let me look at some of the... How do I

109
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:00,340
play this game? Is there like a tutorial? Tools? Video capture? Planet

110
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:07,659
editor? I can make my own planet? I can make like a Minecraft skin?

111
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:12,490
Wait, I can just go anywhere? I don't need any instructions.

112
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:19,320
Oh yeah! Interface. Hey, I'll see you in like fucking four hours.

113
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,720
Welcome to Space Engine. This tutorial will introduce you to Space Engine's

114
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,860
interface. There's Earth. What's all the whipped cream,

115
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,820
though? What is that? This is our planet Earth. The table in the upper left

116
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,620
corner of the screen displays various information about the planet, like

117
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,639
radius, length of day, gravity, and so on. Don't minus two me on that. Come

118
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,169
on. That was like kind of funny. It was like a latte.

119
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,320
All right. It was kind of a bad joke, but whatever. Up in the corner of the

120
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,980
screen displays radius, life, organic, multicellular,

121
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:05,299
marine and terrestrial life, mass, one me, ESI-1, apparent mag, 21

122
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:12,279
phase, apparent size, 21 degrees by 40, 54 degrees by 47 inches by 62 feet.

123
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:19,929
Okay. One year is the orbital period. Rotation period is 23 hours 56 minutes.

124
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:25,539
Age. How old is the Earth? This is 4.5 years.

125
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:34,360
The Earth is 4.5 years old times 10 times 9. 10 times 9, 10 times.

126
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,299
I don't know. That's like a square root. Gravity, one gram.

127
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,259
The sea's composition of Earth is hydrogen

128
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:49,049
and salt. The atmosphere is nitrogen, oxygen, and air. The atmospheric pressure

129
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,850
is one atom. The temperature is 15 degrees Celsius.

130
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,889
The greenhouse effect is 33. The number of moons is one. Cool. Okay.

131
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,090
Interesting. If you left click on any visible object on the screen, Space

132
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,000
Engine will select it and displays information about it. Click any star.

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,779
Any star. Choose any star. I could choose any car.

134
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,490
Okay. This one. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice.

135
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,289
Uh-oh. Don't say it a third time. Now you can read info about the newly

136
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:27,559
selected object. Tiny rotating arrows indicate which object

137
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,960
is selected. It is called selection pointer.

138
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah. Select the Earth again by left clicking on it. All right. So can we go

139
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,210
there? Look at all these toolbars. They have

140
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,850
plenty of useful options, some of which have hotkeys.

141
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,210
Hover the mouse to cursor over any icon to see the hint about its function.

142
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,159
There's a lot of shit going on. Universe map. Solar system browser.

143
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:59,539
Chart. Star browser. Find object. Is there a star named after me?

144
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,899
You guys remember that scam where you could like name a star

145
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:08,179
after somebody? Oh, it's called name a star after your

146
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,740
loved one for like an anniversary present. Remember that scam?

147
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:20,440
Anybody have that done? Like, does anybody have that done so we can find

148
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:29,159
you? No, I'm not. I'm not a boomer. I remember

149
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,899
hearing those on the radio. When your wife knows that you named

150
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:39,779
a star after her, she will be so happy when your

151
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,740
husband comes in after a long day of work and you tell him that you

152
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,899
named him after what is effectively a fucking crumb

153
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,320
in the sky out of trillions of them. He's gonna be so

154
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:04,090
happy with you. Alright, spacecraft manager. I don't have one.

155
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,490
Journey. Log. Locations. Display. I don't want to do that. What if it shows

156
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,539
where I am? Settings. Is that gonna do like a

157
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:16,580
google flag at like my house? I'm scared to press this.

158
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:22,009
This is like a video player. Spacecraft mode.

159
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:27,899
Aircraft mode. Okay, this is like kind of cool. Alright,

160
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,259
so there's a lot of functions here. High dynamic range. The left toolbar,

161
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:33,259
also called the main toolbar, gives you access to all basic functions of

162
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:36,860
space. Clicking on any icon opens a special dialogue window. Click, for

163
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,919
example, this blinking icon. Is that gonna show my location? So you

164
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,259
can see everything about earth. Physical. This is cool.

165
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:52,860
You don't flash me. You may rotate the planet preview in the wiki

166
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,899
windows by holding the left or right mouse button and dragging your mouse.

167
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,259
Try this now. What happened to the back of the

168
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,590
earth? It's like this is like torched. What

169
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,570
happened? Wiki also informs you if the

170
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:15,799
selected object is real or not. Space engine has thousands of real

171
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,759
objects and billions of billions of procedurally generated by programs.

172
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,039
Objects in the uncharted regions of the universe.

173
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,000
This line can help you identify the object,

174
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,980
the type of object. So this is a real earth.

175
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,649
Does that mean there's a fake earth? Click the gear icon. It opens the

176
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,820
settings menu. Yeah, almost everything you can

177
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,460
configure. The settings menu has multiple tabs, each of which groups

178
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,220
settings by their uses. Graphics. Yeah, graphics. You can

179
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,820
tweak anything else. Simulations such as visual style,

180
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,820
depending on your taste using other tabs. Bottom left toolbar also called

181
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,299
navigation toolbar shows movement anytime.

182
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,220
As useful options such as flying automatically to a selected object.

183
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:09,379
Sick. Change in free flight speed and setting date. All icons on this

184
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,820
toolbar act immediately, i.e. don't open any dialogue

185
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,669
windows. All right. Sick. So this is like traveling and

186
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:22,070
speed and sound. The bottom right toolbar is also called the camera

187
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,190
toolbar. Has an options to change the overall

188
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,029
scene brightness. Exposure. Sick. And the limiting stellar magnitude of

189
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,470
galaxies, stars, and planets. It also controls the current field of

190
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:39,899
view. Oh, that's kind of cool. What's this one?

191
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,940
What do these fireworks do? Increase magnitude.

192
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,750
Magnitude. Wait, is this gonna like this? Is this gravity? Am I gonna like

193
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,590
fucking implode the earth? What does that mean? What does that do?

194
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,629
Is this gonna start like morphing, breaking, and ripping apart?

195
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,700
I don't want to do it. Filters has an option to hide and show some types of

196
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,119
objects. And okay, this is the filtering objects.

197
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,640
For example, you may hide stars to observe the Milky Way or hide clouds

198
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,670
on a planet to observe its surface. Hide galaxies. Hide stars. Oh.

199
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:26,140
Hide clusters. Hide nebula. Planets. This is so cool. Hide water. What

200
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,619
happened? Oh, what happened? Where did the

201
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:37,940
water go? Okay, I'm just realizing that was like as if you guys were

202
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,950
like three. You guys, I've been hanging, let me tell you

203
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,400
something, I've been hanging out with a lot of children

204
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,480
over the last week. So I saw my family, nieces and nephews, and like that's

205
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,359
funny to them. Like if I were to get rid of the water,

206
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,559
well where'd the water go? Like so there's gonna be some like kid humor

207
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,549
today. So I've been, I think my nieces and nephews like thought that

208
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,019
just think that kind of shit is funny.

209
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:06,500
So sorry. That's not gonna happen though. Let's get the clouds back here.

210
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,579
Well, without the clouds, this really looks like dumb.

211
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:15,609
Oh clouds. Without the clouds, the atmosphere,

212
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:21,690
any comet trails, any uh auras or yeah this looks like stupid without

213
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,660
like all this cool stuff on it. Wow what a boring shit planet. I want

214
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,740
to move. You know what I'm saying? All right, that's cool. For example, this

215
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,859
icon toggles the displaying of constellations. Click it now, although you

216
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:42,869
can also press x. Constellations. Oh I gotta find me. I gotta

217
00:18:42,869 --> 00:19:06,700
find me. Where am I? What are these constellations?

218
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,619
Octans? Mensa? Chameleon? This is a chameleon constellation, is there?

219
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:20,980
There's a puppy? Where's me? I don't, I want to find me.

220
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:34,940
Phoenix? Arizona? I don't think Phoenix is that way.

221
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:44,950
Capricorn? Sagittarius? Where is my character? Hercules?

222
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,750
There's a, I don't, there's no, is a Hercules constellation?

223
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:59,849
Is it booty? Ursa Minor? Where's Ursa Major?

224
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:03,740
Okay, this is freaking me out. Where is my character? Dude,

225
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,380
I saw a fucking pretty sick game. Make a fighting game

226
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,910
with all the constellations. I said it first so if anybody does it I get 10%

227
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:22,630
of all the revenue. All right, I have no idea what my,

228
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,140
what my character is. So we're just gonna move on.

229
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,940
Constellation Battle Royale. Now I don't know where it is.

230
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:45,640
Oh well. Wait. Where's the Earth? What happened to the Earth?

231
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,680
Oh there it is. Oh thank god. Imagine being in like a spaceship

232
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,470
and you go up there you're an astronaut and just spinning around with like a

233
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,460
camera looking around. Where the fuck did it go?

234
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:04,180
I don't know where it is. Hopefully we just turn us around a little.

235
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,619
Okay you can unlock the main toolbar by ticking the small

236
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,500
pin in the bottom corner. It is blinking red to help you spot it.

237
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,539
So these little pins here. Now if you move the mouse it will go away.

238
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:20,900
That's cool. So they come back when you get close enough. Cool.

239
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:27,079
Let's do it to all of them. All right, this is pretty cool. You can

240
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:38,500
click the pin icon and keeps it there. Two bottom toolbars have a half hide or

241
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,309
half lock option. Tick the pin icon on the navigation

242
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:50,869
toolbar and see what will happen. Isn't that what I just did? Navigation

243
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:54,579
is down here. Now if you move mouse away from the

244
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,240
toolbar it'll hide only the bottom half,

245
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,440
leaving only essential information such as the current time visible. Okay what

246
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,480
so what time is it? 12? 18? 17? I want 12 hour.

247
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,680
I can't read that. I don't know what that means. Now hide it completely

248
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,809
by ticking the pin again. Cool. All right now we're going to

249
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,609
learn how to navigate space. Are you guys ready for like

250
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:30,579
look at this shit? Yeah you won't be here all day.

251
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:34,099
Streamer can't read a clock. I just don't do 24 hour time.

252
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:39,380
This tutorial will teach you basic controls and navigation. Okay I'm

253
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,470
going to do this real quick. Here we go.

254
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,750
You may look around using the mouse by left drag. Okay.

255
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,049
Look around by left drag. Hold that button and move the mouse.

256
00:22:51,049 --> 00:23:03,049
It's kind of takes some. So that'd be being. So that'd take that long.

257
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:14,150
I guess I am in space right? What about right click?

258
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:28,329
DPI? No look at this. Okay is it my FOV? Go to my. I'm gonna take

259
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,369
you guys to my house. I promise once I get an opportunity.

260
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:36,789
You have aircraft movement on. It's dull.

261
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:54,779
What? Are you sure? Oh Jesus. Um how do I turn them off? Spacecraft

262
00:23:54,819 --> 00:24:00,099
mode? I mean I clearly know how to move the left

263
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:06,009
mouse. I know how to do this. Can I get another tutorial here?

264
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:12,119
I have to stay in free flight mode. Free mode.

265
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,069
This is free mode. What the hell is going on?

266
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:20,069
Did you notice the sun? Turn around to see it. The sun is highlighted with

267
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:22,549
the selection pointer which we viewed in the previous

268
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:26,390
tutorial. If an object is outside the screen's edge the indicator arrows

269
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,549
will move in that direction of the object. Move your view towards the

270
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,789
arrow to get that. Wow I don't look right at the sun.

271
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:37,079
Did somebody give a hundred dollars? Holy shit somebody gave a hundred bucks like

272
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,779
five minutes ago. First let me look at the sun and

273
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,730
hurt myself. How long can you do it for? How long

274
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:51,319
can you do it for? One. Two. Three. Four. Ow! I did it for

275
00:24:51,319 --> 00:25:01,450
four seconds. But our Tingy. Thank you Tingy for the

276
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:09,960
hundred bucks. Child humor. It's doing more kid humor.

277
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,000
Hey you want to know how to do kid humor? Here you go.

278
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,549
Here's the foolproof way to make any kid laugh. Did you get hurt? That's it.

279
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:27,480
That's pretty much all you need to do. Did you get hurt or did you surprise

280
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:38,279
them? That's it. Like if I walk and like

281
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,319
and like oh I bumped my knee. Oh ow! It's like

282
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,319
that was not a kid. That was I don't know what that was.

283
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:52,730
I don't know what that was supposed to be. That was not a kid.

284
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:59,529
Anyways Tingy. That was an imp. That was a fucking goblin. Thank you for the

285
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:07,720
hundred dollars Tingy. But thank you. Hundred bucks came in.

286
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,960
May sound like a broken record by now but your streams are such an escape

287
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,200
from reality. For a while I've been struggling with

288
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,640
anxiety and these past two weeks have been unfortunately hell.

289
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,839
Currently on antidepressants but I have to be honest your streams are

290
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,240
the most effective antidepressants there is.

291
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,299
Even when you're not live it's just a vaude and it's just a vaude.

292
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,539
I can't donate enough to show you how much I appreciate you and everything

293
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:31,210
that you do. I'm really sorry that you're going

294
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:38,539
through that shit. Sorry the last couple weeks have not been good

295
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:45,400
but you say broken record. No I say this too all the time and I

296
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,089
mean it. If you enjoy yourself here and this

297
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:50,250
can make you feel better and this can make you take you

298
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,730
a load off then that's great. I'm happy that you're able to have a

299
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,190
place here where this is fun. So thank you so

300
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,569
much for the hundred bucks. Let's learn how to fucking drive a

301
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:08,940
car. Now this is the uh yeah I got this one.

302
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,990
Don't don't step in the poison. Okay you can do that at any time to explore an

303
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,890
object from all sides. By dragging mouse vertically while

304
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,849
holding you can left and right. Uh wait a minute wait wait wait wait

305
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,250
wait wait wait wait wait by dragging mouse vertically while holding both

306
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:29,529
the mouse buttons you go okay got it. More kid humor today. Okay try to

307
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:35,420
zoom and that was a noise right? That was just a noise.

308
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,940
Stop the kid humor. I can't help it. This is all I've been doing for

309
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:43,269
eight days. That's not true. Like the last three or four days were like

310
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,470
working on this project but like five days before

311
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,990
that it was all kid humor. This is the same every stream. Is it?

312
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:57,579
No it's not. Do I do kid humor on the stream? Okay that's cool.

313
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:00,380
Try to zoom out from the earth. Good now we'll learn other basic

314
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:08,970
navigation. Uh okay did you spot the moon? I

315
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:25,750
did not see the moon. Where is it? There it is. So I press C or the

316
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:32,119
blinking and so this is center object. Okay cool. Use it anytime

317
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,279
when you want to find a selected object that you have lost.

318
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:41,289
Try to select any star and center on it. Uh this is the

319
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:46,970
y seti. Set no center. And I can just go there too. Now it's

320
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,849
time to go to the moon. Select the moon and hit the G key

321
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:58,650
for go. G. We are flying to the moon

322
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:06,299
in real time. Every time I press G I go slow down slow I'm gonna crash

323
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:09,579
into it. This is the most useful command in space engine. It's called the go to

324
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:14,680
and you'll use it a lot. You may notice that it works only for selected

325
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,559
objects just like the center command. Okay cool.

326
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:24,940
Orbit the moon with the right mouse button and drag until you see the earth.

327
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,170
Wow look at that. Notice that orbiting as well as zooming

328
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:33,450
works relative to the moon. This is because the go to command binds your

329
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,450
controls to the new object. The moon. The name of the currently

330
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,410
bound object displayed on the navigation tool with the following moon.

331
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:46,700
That's really cool. Sick. You may bind to a different object manually by selecting

332
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,390
it and pressing shift f. So bind to here is shift f. I'm now

333
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:56,859
bound to the earth. Now you may orbit the earth with the

334
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:04,680
right drag. Wow. I'm gonna this is gonna be I'll puke

335
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,019
if I keep doing this. Let's return back to earth. Click the

336
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:13,220
blinking icon on the navigation toolbar. It works like a double press of G.

337
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:22,140
The fast go to. This is go to object. Nice. Hit

338
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,420
f2 or click the moon the main menu solar system browser.

339
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,160
It shows all the stars planets and moons in the current planetary system.

340
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,589
Left click on a planet to select it. Well we gotta go to jupiter.

341
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:42,940
Okay so I have jupiter selected. Somebody's asked can I destroy the

342
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,029
earth in this game. Not everything has to be about

343
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:54,660
destruction and conflict. Okay now I can center that so we're

344
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,539
centered on jupiter. Try this. Select Venus and go to

345
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:04,099
it. So I want to I want to but I want to go to

346
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:15,880
jupiter. Venus center on Venus and then go to Venus. This is really

347
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:26,730
what it's like. That's not what Venus looks like. This

348
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:34,440
is not Venus. That's not what Venus looks like. I know

349
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:42,359
what Venus looks like because it's in my chat right now.

350
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,720
Venus is for some reason in this game

351
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,839
it's when you get the defect gumball from the gumball machine that

352
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:54,630
didn't get any coloring put on it. That's not true. Venus looks like

353
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:00,539
it's in the chat. Okay you can navigate the solar system browser like folders in

354
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,700
your computer. Double click on any planet which has

355
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:14,630
moons. What? Does Venus not have a moon?

356
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:21,109
What? Yeah doesn't. Okay you can also click the satellites icon which

357
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:25,640
appears on the planet's cell when you hover a mouse over it.

358
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,900
Satellites. Oh wait what about jupiter? Oh isn't it? Okay I

359
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,710
I'm not even looking at the screen. I know the jupiter moons. It's

360
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:47,269
Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Yo right? Yep I got it. You've entered this list of

361
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,869
satellites. You can select any by left clicking to go back double click on the

362
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:55,559
parent object. That's so cool. All right let's like

363
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:03,259
center on that. It's easy. Now select Yo the moon of

364
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:06,460
Jupiter. Double click on Jupiter enter its moons and left click on

365
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:12,279
Yo. Now that the select is pointing to now fly there using the go to

366
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:30,779
command. We're going to Yo. Here it comes. Whoa what?

367
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:34,539
Nice close the solar system browser by hitting F2 or prison the eye. Yeah F2

368
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:37,660
you can close the solar system browser. Let's go to Saturn. You can find it by

369
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:44,299
using the solar system browser or by the search tool.

370
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:49,190
Saturn. There it is center. Just take a look where it is.

371
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:55,180
Go to Saturn. By the way you think this is the the whole game?

372
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,539
I've got an extreme news for you. No you can land on any planet you

373
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,339
want and explore it. This is not just like look at the

374
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:09,480
planet simulator. Any of these planets can be it's like

375
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,809
what's that game? Once again that guy was on all the late

376
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:15,769
night tv shows talking about how it was like the greatest thing ever

377
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:18,889
and it wasn't the greatest thing ever at all and then like three years

378
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:29,619
later they like made it really good. No man's sky that's what it is okay.

379
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:34,440
Show us your house. I've got to learn how to play.

380
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,739
All right I'm on Saturn. Click the lens icon. Yeah it wants me to

381
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:47,639
search. Parents, son, asteroid. All right hold on.

382
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:56,340
Damn it. Nobody named a star after me? All right dude how many of these

383
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:12,659
are actually oh is it like a you have to think there's gonna be

384
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:26,090
because they had that like star registry thing.

385
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,690
Big Bits just came in right now. Big Bits, Big Bits, Big Bits. I got it. I

386
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,980
got it. I got it. The Diabeetles just gave 100 bucks. 200

387
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,219
dollars back to back here. Thanks guys.

388
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:42,260
Thank you Diabeetles for the 100 bucks and they say hey Jerma things have been

389
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,139
pretty rough lately. I recently separated from my fiance and

390
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:47,460
it just seems like things were getting worse from there.

391
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,869
I'm fucking sorry to hear that but even at my lowest I could go back to

392
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:53,510
your videos or watch your streams and you've always given me a reason to

393
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,570
laugh. Going back to therapy and I'm making

394
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,219
changes to make my life better. Just wanted to thank you. I've been

395
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,590
watching since 2012 and I always could come to you for a

396
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,500
laugh. I'm happy that you're taking some necessary steps here to

397
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,820
take care of yourself. Making some changes. Going to therapy.

398
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,130
I wish you the best of luck. I'm really sorry to fucking hear that. That's

399
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,369
that sucks. But keep your head up because

400
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:30,840
I'm not sure how old you are but I really do truly wish you the best

401
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:36,230
because that's tough. Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for watching the

402
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:51,079
videos and the streams for that long. Glad you have a good time.

403
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,880
Look at all these. Look at all these Jerma hearts in the chat. That

404
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,340
makes me feel good. It does. All right. How about just

405
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:04,090
like John? Yeah. Johnson. This is absolutely

406
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:09,800
somebody's star registry name. How about like I don't know somebody has to have

407
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,289
some like like I don't know like Gandalf right?

408
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:23,079
No. I don't know like Da Vinci? Did like did Leonardo Da Vinci have a

409
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:33,349
star named after him? No. Was that just a scam? I don't think

410
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:41,210
it even did anything. All right well we have to find Saturn.

411
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,139
There it is. Saturn 1. Saturn 2. Saturn 3.

412
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:54,119
Saturn 4. Saturn 9. Saturn L.

413
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,449
What does that mean? Saturn L3? How many Saturns are there?

414
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:10,869
Okay let's go to Saturn. Saturn. No Saturn.

415
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:16,860
I'm gonna click okay. Perfect. To consolidate the knowledge go to Mars.

416
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,719
Find it using the solar system browser. Yeah we can just go Mars.

417
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:25,239
There it is. Hey how many Marses are there?

418
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:39,179
Oh yeah I want to go. Go to. There it is. That's not even what Mars looks like.

419
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:44,579
Somebody put Mars here please. Actually yeah it is. All right now we're gonna

420
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:54,550
learn how to fly. We're almost done. All right I'm not

421
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,510
gonna make any more jokes. I'm just gonna blow through the

422
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:01,210
tutorial so just put on like your favorite song

423
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:12,170
and I mean I recommend. I don't know. Put on like church music or something. Who cares?

424
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,130
All right I'm gonna go. Just don't pay attention to me anymore.

425
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,130
I'm just gonna do the tutorial and we're gonna go.

426
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,400
Advanced movement control space. Basic controls. Yeah yeah moving around like this and that.

427
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,380
Clicking outside the solar system. Okay find the planet.

428
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,960
Go find the planet Trappist. Okay let's get that open.

429
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:41,300
Trappist. Trappist 1G. F E F G. Okay then let's get out. Let's get

430
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:54,019
over there. Go to. Oh this is cool. Wait what? Did I go too fast?

431
00:39:54,019 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh boy. Alien ice icy planet almost 40 light years away from Earth.

432
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,360
Now we will learn the free movement. The go-to command allows you to quickly

433
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,159
reach the desired object but exploring it is much more

434
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:12,840
enjoyable using a game like free movement. Press the W key.

435
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,360
Press the W key. It's the funnest word to say in broadcasting.

436
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,280
Once you learn how to say W it becomes so much fun for you to do.

437
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:26,039
W W W W W W W W W W W. It's so. Once you go to

438
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,199
broadcasting school you'll learn it. It's fun.

439
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:36,139
You did this joke before. No I didn't. No I didn't. No I didn't.

440
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:41,670
All right I gotta fucking calm down. You may move in multiple directions.

441
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:52,409
R and F is up and down. Okay cool. A D W S R F.

442
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:56,070
Yep. W and then S to fly forward and backward. Yep.

443
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,980
A and D left and right. Yep. R and F to go

444
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,460
rup and then found. You may change the flight direction with the mouse.

445
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:12,260
Press W to fly forward and then. Remember these two key keys. Q and E.

446
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:25,030
They change your roll. Whoa. All right. What kid joke.

447
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:31,780
Now try to reach the waypoint. Come on like Superman 64.

448
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,099
Adjust your velocity with the mouse wheel with the plus and minus keys.

449
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:39,590
Now depending on how funny you are this stream you will go faster or

450
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,670
slower. Scroll the wheel up. Press the

451
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:46,920
plus key to increase to 1000 kilometers a second. Perfect. Now you

452
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,239
can reach the waypoint quicker. This is another indicator that shows your

453
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:53,780
current velocity. It is zero while standing and equal to

454
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,340
the assigned velocity while moving. Reach the waypoint.

455
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:04,920
Okay. Good. Proceed to the next waypoint. The selection pointer will help you

456
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,429
locate it. Try this. Whoa. Slowly descend on the

457
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:20,780
planet surface. This is Superman 64 and then we're

458
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:29,059
going to land on the planet. Remember Q R E. Two waypoints left.

459
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:33,340
This is the surface of the universe. One less

460
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:42,659
surface. Here it is. Look at this shit. Are they aliens?

461
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,250
All right. I made it. We are on the surface now. Note

462
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,130
that if you hit the ground your velocity will be flat.

463
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:57,190
Fly to the green waypoint ahead and explore the terrain. Explore the

464
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:00,469
planet. Depending on your computer speed

465
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:10,860
terrain may take a while to load. I got a pretty fast computer speed.

466
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,449
Cool. Free flight is easy isn't it? Now let's return to space. Just fly

467
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:19,210
into the sky away from the planet or use the R key to fly straight up.

468
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,090
Increase your speed to 100 to 200 kilometers a second with the mouse

469
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:44,039
wheel to do that faster. Whoa. I'll never dig straight up.

470
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,599
That's pretty cool. Great. We're in space again. You also may use the go

471
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,079
to command to fly to a default distance from the planet.

472
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:59,989
Go to object. Ah okay. You can land on a planet automatically

473
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:11,980
shift G on any planet to do that. How fast? But that's fast. Wow. Another

474
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,619
way to land on a planet or exit to space is using the zoom.

475
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:18,860
Hold both the left and right buttons and drag the mouse vertically.

476
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,099
Note that this works with the current bound object.

477
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:35,690
Oh interesting. Yep. It works. Okay. Now you know the basics of the free

478
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,489
flight in space engine. You can explore anything with it. Not only

479
00:44:38,489 --> 00:44:42,650
planets. Simply increase your velocity to some unimaginable value and fly to

480
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:55,059
interstellar space. Not yet. Not yet. Okay. Let's just get back out.

481
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:05,210
So is that it? Do I now know how to play? All right. Let's go.

482
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:20,539
Where should I go? Where am I? Whoa. 10. Set the velocity of 10 light years

483
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:27,130
a second. That's too fast. C's? How many C's?

484
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,130
What's the C mean? A U is a second. That's a that is

485
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:35,960
you go over the course of Australia in a second. That's how much terrain that is.

486
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:43,420
This is a thousand Australias a second. One. Okay. Now one light year a second.

487
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,179
10 light years a second. Is this gonna hurt? I feel like this is gonna be

488
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:59,340
scary. You may approach any star and enter its planetary system.

489
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,699
Fly to Betelgeuse. It is highlighted with the selection pointer. Aim the

490
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:15,670
camera towards it and press W to fly forward. Heading towards Betelgeuse.

491
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:22,309
Now that's the third time? No. It's okay. It's okay.

492
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:44,710
Betelgeuse is dead. So it's okay. I didn't have I didn't have it cued up.

493
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:47,829
But he's like a demon. He's gone. He was like purged

494
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:58,059
fucking a million years ago. Okay. Hold on.

495
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:08,519
Slow down. What is this? Hey no. Too fast.

496
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,039
Get over there. 778 Australias a second. That sounds good.

497
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:20,599
Center on you. You're now entering the planetary system. Small dots near

498
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:25,139
the star are its planets. Approach the star so you can see its

499
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:32,409
surface. Oh. Oh it's gold. It means gold. AU is gold. It's gold.

500
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:42,739
That's what it is. Wow. That was fun. Okay this is Betelgeuse.

501
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:47,349
One of the brightest stars in the constellation of Orion.

502
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,710
A red supergiant. It looks lumpy because of very weak gravity on its

503
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,000
surface which is barely maintaining the gas in its place.

504
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,039
Now look at the filters toolbar. Click the blinking icon to show orbital

505
00:48:00,039 --> 00:48:04,260
paths of planets. Oh that's cool. You can see like

506
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:18,570
where the rotations are for oops. Where did I go? Shit.

507
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:27,000
Where? Hold on. Where was it? Oh shit it's it's it's lost in the crumbs.

508
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:52,500
Oh fuck. Hold on. There it is. Oh okay now I'm orbiting this. I get it.

509
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,480
Okay all right. Orbits of planets will help you with

510
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,440
visual navigation in the planetary system. Planets are shining dots at the

511
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,400
bright ends of lines. Try to reach any planet. Oh I didn't

512
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,469
turn color. Now try to reach any planet manually

513
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:14,409
What's going on? What's going on? What's happening? What?

514
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:21,690
Okay I have to slow down. So I need to fly into a planet that's orbiting.

515
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:27,699
Let's go down here. There it is. We got to go faster than

516
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:41,079
this. 285 Celsius. Right here. This one. What is this one?

517
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:47,289
Betelgeuse 2. Let's fly to it. This one looks cool. Wait a minute. Hold on.

518
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:53,000
There's more in here? Betelgeuse 2 has its own life system.

519
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,550
Its own solar system. Orbits of planets.

520
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,949
Perfect. Now that you know how to explore the universe in free flight mode, next

521
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:06,010
tutorial will teach you how to manipulate time flow.

522
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:13,369
Wait a minute. Where'd I just go? I just like sucked into it.

523
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:31,219
Shit. Get up. Up. Go up. Okay I want to turn off like the gas.

524
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:39,820
I'm on the surface. Whoa no I'm not. Holy shit.

525
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,860
All right I'm out. Okay now we can do time.

526
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:54,760
Look we're getting close. There it is. All right.

527
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,079
The navigation toolbar has all the options for time control. Some of which

528
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,599
have their own hotkey. The blinking element is the date bar.

529
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:06,360
It displays the current simulation date and time. I can't wait to see what

530
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,119
Las Vegas looks like when it was like two million years ago.

531
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,360
It may differ from the real date because in space engine you're free

532
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:23,179
in space and time. Cool. Right. Whatever. The buttons below the

533
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:28,780
date bar control time flow. You can speed up and slow down the

534
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,539
time, reverse it, and reset it to the current date based on the system

535
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:39,909
clock. Speed up the time to see space bodies in movement. Press the L key

536
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:50,420
to speed up the flow to times 10. Selection pointer. Disabled. What?

537
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,699
Planet Shine. Disabled. What? What are you talking about? L key.

538
00:51:53,699 --> 00:52:05,579
Am I missing something here? Press the L key or this button

539
00:52:05,579 --> 00:52:23,719
twice. What's going on here? Did I mess something up?

540
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:37,820
Shift L. Planet Shine. L. Something's going on here.

541
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,780
Now sometimes the game bugs regarding time. Might have to reset it. Hold on.

542
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:45,940
Let's try this. Oh there we go. Times 10. I lost my

543
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:52,920
tutorial though. This is just times 10 speed but I don't

544
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:03,659
have my tutorial anymore. I'm lost. Times 100 speed. Times a

545
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:08,900
thousand. Times 10,000. Times 30,000. Times 5

546
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,820
million. At some point this is going to turn into

547
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:18,280
like a pottery. It's going to be... Is it burning up on the top?

548
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:36,760
Stop. Set normal time speed. Okay. I want to get off the ride.

549
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:44,809
All right. I think I need to see if we can get that back. Okay.

550
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:48,250
Date and time. Yeah. We can do... We can reverse it.

551
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,130
Times 10 speed. There we go. I'll get it. Times 10.

552
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:56,500
Continue increasing the time till you get to 3,000.

553
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:04,920
3,000. Okay. Now press the O key to see the orbits.

554
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,380
You can put on labels. What is that? What does it want me to do?

555
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,159
Oh. You can observe the orbit of motion of the

556
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:20,679
Galilean moons. O, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. To make it more

557
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:25,239
convenient zoom out from Jupiter to 5 million kilometers left plus right

558
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:32,579
and drag to see now the whole thing. So the

559
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:35,780
moon's orbits will be seen from the top. Look at the Jupiter info table

560
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:42,420
for the distance readout. This is cool. Look at how educational

561
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,820
this is. Imagine if you were... Who's sniping Jupiter right now?

562
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:56,650
Is there something... Is that bad? Okay. Jupiter info table.

563
00:54:59,269 --> 00:55:11,099
The distance readout. Distance readout. What is the orbit here?

564
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:15,670
Should I have gone out further? 5 million kilometers.

565
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:23,619
I mean this is 5 million kilometers. Right here is 5 million.

566
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:32,230
And orbit to its northern pole. I was already there. Now accelerate

567
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:46,019
time by times 30,000. Oops. Back. This is insane.

568
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:48,340
Now we will learn all the buttons which it controls the speed of time.

569
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:54,139
Press the space bar to pause the simulation.

570
00:55:54,139 --> 00:56:06,309
Again, to resume. Kids jokes are costing him this time.

571
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:11,019
It's all right. It's all right. These kids jokes really. They do very, very

572
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:14,949
well. These kids jokes do very, very well

573
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:18,230
during a paused bathroom break of Zootopia. So

574
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:23,659
I mean come on. All right. Jakey reverses the time

575
00:56:23,659 --> 00:56:32,440
flow. So we're now going in reverse. Reverse time.

576
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:40,340
That's ridiculous. Note that the simulation date and time displayed in

577
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:48,519
the date bar are counting backwards. It's 2016 already.

578
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:54,309
Restore the normal direction. Accelerate time to 3000

579
00:56:54,309 --> 00:57:01,139
by pressing the K key several times. You can put it back to real time

580
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:06,340
like this. Control slash sets the simulation time

581
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:12,039
to the current system time. I'll just press it. Okay.

582
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,159
Great. We have now learned time speed controls. Remember the reverse

583
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:18,599
decelerate, accelerate, set normal, set current. Got it.

584
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,400
You can easily change the simulation date time by clicking the date bar and

585
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:35,829
typing the desired date. Okay. 2016, period 11,

586
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:44,739
period 15, 21. Okay. And then hour and minute. Or that's

587
00:57:44,739 --> 00:57:51,780
just fine. And then hit enter. Whoa. Now we will

588
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,460
use your knowledge to catch up to the solar eclipse on Europa. Look at

589
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:05,289
Europa and accelerate up to 10,000. Pause time with the

590
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:11,829
space bar when Europa enters the shadow. What shadow? Like over here?

591
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:20,500
Yeah, like right here. Now slowly accelerate the time

592
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:29,179
until Europa starts moving. 1000 times is a good value. Once Europa exits

593
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:41,480
the shadow, reverse the time flow. The moon will start moving back. Wait

594
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,679
until Europa enters the shadow and exits from the opposite side. Then

595
00:58:44,679 --> 00:59:05,670
decrease the speed to minus 100. Almost. Restore the normal time

596
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:11,860
flow by pressing J. When Europa enters the shadow again, set the time speed to

597
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:16,980
real time. What? Can I just see it? Can I just like

598
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:37,260
look at it? Now go to Europa. Europa. Wow, it's

599
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:40,059
completely black. Reverse the time flow and accelerate it a bit until

600
00:59:40,059 --> 00:59:59,739
Europa exits the shadow. Reverse time flow. And accelerate. No!

601
00:59:59,739 --> 01:00:07,400
Go back. Can I go back? No, no, no. Other way. Other way. Reverse the

602
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:14,150
flow. Now land to this green point and

603
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:20,170
watch the sun getting eclipsed by Jupiter. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

604
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:23,780
Wait, stop. Pause it right there. This is as good as it. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

605
01:00:23,780 --> 01:01:19,130
Stop time. Oh, whoa. Oh, cool. Here we go.

606
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:28,219
Wow. The next tutorial. Guys, I know what we're going to do.

607
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:34,469
I need people to find events that happen to the solar system.

608
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:38,070
You know what I mean? When did like an asteroid like explode?

609
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,670
We have to go find the exact day and time of where it was and go

610
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:46,980
watch it. All right. The next tutorial will

611
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:54,969
teach you how to use the telescope. We're getting there. Well, we're done.

612
01:01:54,969 --> 01:02:08,650
This is like photo modes. Did you notice the thin lines near Jupiter's

613
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,739
crescent? These are its very faint dusty rings

614
01:02:13,739 --> 01:02:17,539
that are only visible under certain lighting conditions. You may make them

615
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:20,420
more visible by switching space engine to the realistic photographic mode.

616
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:27,530
Press the V key. Oh, okay. This is the auto exposure

617
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:31,210
mode. In this mode space engine renders celestial objects with

618
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,170
physical accurate brightness in attempts to adjust

619
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,969
camera sensitivity or exposure automatically. When you look at a dark

620
01:02:36,969 --> 01:02:39,929
sky it sets it to a human eye sensitivity.

621
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:44,469
Who cares? You know what I mean? Exposure one.

622
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:52,250
We'll just display it as exposure one. Yeah, I mean we can make this look cool.

623
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:57,059
We can take photos. We can zoom in. Yeah, I get it.

624
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:08,019
I get it. I do. You know what I mean? I get it.

625
01:03:08,019 --> 01:03:23,510
All right, we got it. I don't think the camera mode is something that's

626
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,519
interesting. We can do... I know how to work it.

627
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:31,639
Photo camera. We got... Notice the value of the exposure display.

628
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:37,019
Roughly corresponds to the photo camera shutter speed. Oh yeah, something's wrong

629
01:03:37,019 --> 01:03:49,699
here. There we go. Press and hold this, this

630
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:56,250
to change the exposure value. Yep. You can make it look really, really

631
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:02,840
blown up and nice and cool. Yeah, this is cool.

632
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,800
All right, I'm ready. I don't think there's anything else I need to do.

633
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,690
Universe map maybe. I kind of want to just browse around for a little

634
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:15,019
bit. You know what I mean? I'm just going

635
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:23,400
to go. I want to browse around. So this is

636
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,440
where we are. Where are we? We're at the cold,

637
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:40,780
airless... Turn up object quality. Where would that be? Visual style?

638
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:56,780
Lens flare? We'll look at object quality. Filter objects? No, we got

639
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:15,849
that. That looks good. Graphics? Go to custom.

640
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:27,349
I'm scared. Should I do... I mean black hole... I feel like this is going to

641
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:31,800
break my computer. Max the shit out? I can't do that. My

642
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,210
computer's not good enough. I don't got AMD. Maximum graphics. I'm

643
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:47,400
not going to be able to stream this. High. I'm keeping it on high. No, this is

644
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,789
all right. All right, let's just go. So I want to...

645
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:54,460
Where's earth? I want to first see how detailed this is.

646
01:05:54,460 --> 01:06:02,380
Where's earth? And where's my search? There it is. Okay,

647
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:09,829
earth. Right there. Go to earth. Is that the sun?

648
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:13,750
There we go. All right, so I want to do the current date.

649
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:16,869
This is what it looks like right now outside your house. Outside your

650
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:20,809
window when you look. This is what it looks like. Well,

651
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:24,070
you know what I mean? Like when you're looking down... When you're looking down

652
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,070
out your window if you're in a spacecraft above the earth. This is

653
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:36,659
what it looked like. So let's go to the United States.

654
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:48,380
Australia. There's... Is that Africa? No, that's South America. I mean,

655
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:52,389
that's Brazil. I know what it is. God. Give me a

656
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:55,190
break guys. You think I'm crazy? All right, let's... I want to make it so

657
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:03,900
we're like in the... Let's spin it around. I need some light. I want the

658
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:10,900
sun. I don't want it to be dark. Come to Brazil. I will. I'll go to

659
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:22,500
Brazil. So we're gonna go see. Okay, maybe a little bit more. Okay,

660
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:27,940
that looks good. I need to set this as like the object in

661
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:34,460
rotating the earth. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

662
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:49,110
Oh, shit! I used one of my wishes. Hold on. Should I try to find Las Vegas

663
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:54,869
from here? All right, I'm gonna try to. Let's

664
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:58,710
see if I can find my house from the middle of the ocean.

665
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:07,539
There's no way I'm gonna fucking do this. It's ocean in every direction.

666
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:11,739
This is 200 miles per hour. I'm essentially a plane.

667
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:21,350
But hide everything. I don't want any tips. I'm a plane right now.

668
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:36,579
All right, hold on. The sun... The sun sets in the east and rises in the

669
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:40,250
west. No, the sun sets and rises in the east,

670
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:49,989
sets in the west. This is the right way. The home of the rising sun

671
01:08:49,989 --> 01:09:08,789
is east. You can just fly a plane. I'm in the plane right now. Can I do

672
01:09:08,789 --> 01:09:23,850
a different view? Do planes go 2,000 miles per hour?

673
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:34,460
I don't think planes go fucking 5,000 miles per hour.

674
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:52,920
No, they don't. They go like 600. Ooh. Acceleration. All right, I need to

675
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:04,170
find land. Left toolbar for vehicles.

676
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:27,159
Spacecraft manager? Drunk superman. It's actually kind of

677
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:32,329
fun to control this because it's really delayed. I just

678
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:48,090
need to get to land. I think I see land. The sun is

679
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:54,680
setting in my face. Good luck finding anything. I think I can see land right

680
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:00,220
here. Is this California? All right, slow down, slow down, slow down.

681
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,020
Wait, no, that's not California. Where's California? I gotta find

682
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:15,989
California. I'm going so fast. I would have already crossed land by

683
01:11:15,989 --> 01:11:27,319
now, wouldn't I? I'm going east? Wait, did the sun just

684
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:39,420
rise? Is this rising or is the sun setting? What day is it?

685
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,180
It's setting. All right, so that's fine. Should I put time up a little just

686
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:50,649
to make sure? Hold on. I'm gonna increase time. Is

687
01:11:50,649 --> 01:11:58,819
that going down? That shit's going up. That's going up. I'm going the

688
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:17,460
wrong way. Hold on, folks. Am I just in the Pacific

689
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:26,060
Ocean? Can I see what ocean this is? I'm sorry. I'm trying to get to

690
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,750
Vegas. I went a different route this time.

691
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:37,060
I decided to go across the whole Pacific Ocean twice.

692
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:46,119
Normal time. Normal time. Time scale. Use the balloon option. There is no

693
01:12:46,119 --> 01:13:02,680
balloon. Should I swim? What's going on?

694
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:07,079
Okay, get me in the normal...

695
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:12,420
Okay. No, that's too fast. How fast can you swim?

696
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,739
I could probably go like, I don't know, 15 miles per hour? 20 miles per hour

697
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:30,069
swimming? All right, where am I? Can I see like

698
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:35,159
longitude, latitude? All right, I'm in 35. No, that's time.

699
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:40,729
Where's longitude, latitude? I need info. I can't even use

700
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:48,939
wiki. Where's the sun? I have to stare at the sun for a second.

701
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:58,710
I need to know how... I need... Where's it going? We gotta go that way.

702
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:03,260
The sun rises in the east, sets in the west. We gotta go... What's going on?

703
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:10,729
Oh, we gotta go that way. All right, stop.

704
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:18,329
Okay, normal time scale. Let's go. All right, just imagine that I was in like

705
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,770
a... I don't know, like a sailboat. They

706
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:31,060
go how fast? Like 60? Okay, now we're in the plane again. Here we go. Let's

707
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:35,670
go. I'm gonna go faster. This is going

708
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:39,989
to take you days. No, if you go 2,000 miles per hour,

709
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:46,359
it's not gonna do that. I'm going so fast right now, like

710
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:50,649
I'm just gonna get across the ocean. This is 20 fucking thousand, 50,000 miles

711
01:14:50,649 --> 01:15:07,239
per hour. Where's the sun? There it is. 100,000 miles per hour.

712
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:14,979
Where the fuck is land? I'm almost going a million miles per

713
01:15:14,979 --> 01:15:49,850
hour. Where is land? What the fuck is going on? Is there

714
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:57,819
no land on earth? I'm going 5 million miles per hour.

715
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:01,399
Then the oceans are not this big. Wait, wait!

716
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:22,760
Those clouds? Earth is 75% water. What is that? What's this? What is

717
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:35,590
this? Found it. But what land? Planet Earth. What continent is

718
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:56,710
this? I made it. My computer's not good enough

719
01:16:56,710 --> 01:17:08,020
though. All right, let me see. Let me guess where I am.

720
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:11,619
Yes, I know. I'm aware that this looks like a Minecraft skin. I know.

721
01:17:11,619 --> 01:17:23,500
This is a Minecraft seed. I think, I think I'm in

722
01:17:23,500 --> 01:18:05,670
China. China. I don't know where, where am I?

723
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:10,539
I was right! I was right! It was pretty close.

724
01:18:10,539 --> 01:18:21,500
I was pretty close. Okay, now I just have to go to Vegas without

725
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:34,279
guessing. That's Russia? No, it's not. It's China. Okay, here we go.

726
01:18:34,279 --> 01:19:00,710
Let's go to Las Vegas. There ain't nothing here. There's nothing here.

727
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:10,500
Oh shit. Oh well. It's just the same bitmap image. I wonder, can I like

728
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,380
actually search for Vegas? I don't think they would have like that

729
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:17,989
kind of shit on here. Why would they have that on here?

730
01:19:17,989 --> 01:19:29,979
Vegas. All right, let's see if I can find... Whoa, easy.

731
01:19:29,979 --> 01:19:36,250
All right, can I... I mean this is like the desert connecting California

732
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:46,579
to Vegas. Are there any cities? Why would there

733
01:19:46,579 --> 01:19:52,869
be cities? This is a space exploration game. Why

734
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:55,590
do I care about if there are cities or not?

735
01:19:55,590 --> 01:20:02,949
We can go anywhere in the world. We would just be doing Google Earth. Yeah.

736
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:13,079
Why would I be doing this? I'm only exploring

737
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:18,489
Earth. Oh yeah, I have to explore the universe. All right.

738
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:25,800
What's that? The Andromeda. But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I want to see

739
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,800
something. Hold on. Let's do a once and for all. Once

740
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:35,939
and for all. Let's see if it's true. So according... I want to see if Pangea

741
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:46,739
exists. You know what I'm saying? Let's see if it's real. Okay, so we're

742
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:55,140
gonna go back here. We're gonna reverse time. We're gonna

743
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:00,539
go back to... How many years?

744
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:15,180
How many years was Pangea? It's like one?

745
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:27,350
One. One, one. Yeah, one, one, one. Just one. Let's see what it looks

746
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,399
like. And then we'll do it like, I don't know,

747
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:46,329
two o'clock. All right, so what we got here?

748
01:21:46,329 --> 01:21:59,659
Ah, fucking Pangea debunked. Why are there

749
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:05,750
lights? Why are there so much city lights? Okay, so

750
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:24,300
one ad. Can I do negative time? This is minus ten thousand. Oh, hold on.

751
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:48,729
There's hundreds of millions. That's not enough. There's no rotation on the

752
01:22:48,729 --> 01:23:08,260
Earth. Why? No, still not connected. The

753
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:27,369
Earth hasn't spun yet. Oh, there we go. Okay. No, it looks

754
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,489
pretty normal to me. Sorry, guys. All right, give me an event.

755
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:36,199
How about a comet? What's like a cool comet?

756
01:23:36,199 --> 01:23:41,159
What's a comet that's gone through? Somebody just dumped coordinates into the

757
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:48,020
chat. And oh yeah, the Andromeda. I want to

758
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:54,859
check out the Andromeda. Andromeda. It's a galaxy. Let's go to it.

759
01:23:54,859 --> 01:24:05,000
Normal time. Look at this place. All right, let's get it. So there's...

760
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,600
Let's get in the galaxy. Now, what's in here? What's this?

761
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:17,659
M-110. Oh, fuck. I'm still in 10 minus 10 million BC.

762
01:24:17,659 --> 01:24:21,739
Current time. There we go. And we're on

763
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:26,100
times one scale. That's fine. You guys ready?

764
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:39,479
I'm flying at insane speeds. What's in here?

765
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:49,800
Go right into the center. Hold on, wait. The Andromeda is gonna collide.

766
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:59,220
Whoa, hold on. Slow down a little. Who the fuck are you?

767
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:09,300
RS-1235. Let's get some more info on you, please.

768
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:23,029
This is the one. Found it. Watch the collision. Let's get in there.

769
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:29,369
All right, let's take a look. White luminous supergiant.

770
01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:32,970
Go find a black hole. I'm gonna try, but let me... I want to get onto this

771
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:38,539
planet. I want to see what it's like on here.

772
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:43,060
Increase the mag limit. What does that do?

773
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:49,859
I didn't do the tutorial for this. What does this mean? Why? What's... Why? What's

774
01:25:49,859 --> 01:26:04,069
going on with all the things in the background here?

775
01:26:04,069 --> 01:26:13,640
That's all stars. All right, let's get onto the surface.

776
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:27,020
It can't be this bright on the surface, right? Holy shit, this is cool.

777
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:35,180
Imagine being able to stand here. How much did you pay to do this?

778
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:44,250
Press V. What's all these, like, divots and grooves and shit?

779
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:54,619
I want to get off of this. How do I let go?

780
01:26:54,699 --> 01:27:02,869
V. Oh, photo mode was on the whole time. All right, let's get closer.

781
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:09,800
Can I take samples? Why can I take a sample? And why can't I

782
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,180
leave? How do I, like, deselect this planet? G? Shift?

783
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:18,380
F? I want to just fly around. Free mode here. Come on.

784
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:36,489
Free mode. F. I can't leave. What, is this place just huge?

785
01:27:36,489 --> 01:27:44,970
Oh, fuck. It's that big. Oh, I get it. I feel like I'm crawling across

786
01:27:44,970 --> 01:28:02,010
somebody's skin. It's a supergiant. Well, that's...

787
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:08,920
Who cares? I'm gonna go this way. What do you guys want to see?

788
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:14,979
The explosion between... Ooh, that's cool. Is that what they look like?

789
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:19,189
All right. And the Andromeda and... When did it happen?

790
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:37,109
When did the Andromeda crash? It's not in the game. Oh.

791
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:40,149
But look at that. Okay, what is this? This is a moon?

792
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:53,859
Oh, this is a planet. This is a star. This is a planet.

793
01:28:53,859 --> 01:28:57,939
Go look at a black hole. I gotta find one. Hold on. I just got, like...

794
01:28:57,939 --> 01:29:02,100
I just got, like, a shotgun blasted in, like, Overwatch

795
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:19,779
in the face. Slow down. I'm playing Overwatch.

796
01:29:19,779 --> 01:29:22,659
That was... That wasn't... I wasn't making a kid joke. I was making, like, a...

797
01:29:22,659 --> 01:29:26,100
That's what it felt like. I felt like I just got shot by, like, a

798
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,859
video game shotgun. What is this? This is called

799
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:46,460
Torrid Arid Super Terra. Whoa. That's a photo right there. Hold on.

800
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:50,010
That's a photo mode. The giant egg. The giant, like,

801
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,329
golden egg. I gotta get in a good spot for this.

802
01:29:52,329 --> 01:30:00,649
Over here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go. Right

803
01:30:00,649 --> 01:30:23,479
here. On the ground. Photo mode. Let's go.

804
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:39,850
Oh, Jesus. Slow down. Why is it so bright?

805
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:51,050
That's kind of ominous. All right, here we go. No. No, no, no. Go back.

806
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:55,430
No! Oh, what have I done? That's fine. Right there.

807
01:30:55,430 --> 01:31:05,619
Drop the magnitude a little bit. Right there. All right. Take it.

808
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:16,859
Got it. You want to see it orbit. Okay, fine. I can do that.

809
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:32,420
There it goes. I feel like I'm watching slow-mo a basketball go into

810
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:50,250
a hoop. I'm gonna pull out. There you go.

811
01:31:50,250 --> 01:32:06,869
You can see its path here. This is cool. This is awesome.

812
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:40,119
Just get, like, eyes on this. It's kind of cool. All right, back to normal.

813
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:46,810
All right, let's go. I want to go somewhere else. I want to find a black hole.

814
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:54,020
They're both 3,500 degrees. Look for 55

815
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:59,609
cankri. A super earth made out of diamonds.

816
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:06,180
Wait, what? A super earth made out of diamonds.

817
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:20,819
What do you say it was called? Cankri? I don't think it's here.

818
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:35,270
Diana. 55 can... 55 cankri. No, it's not here.

819
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:40,329
Wait, there it is! 55 cankri right here. All right, did you tell me this is

820
01:33:40,329 --> 01:33:47,539
made out of diamonds? That would be pretty crazy if it was.

821
01:33:47,539 --> 01:34:07,930
Hold on. Orange dwarf. It is 5... 5,200 degrees.

822
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:19,159
Kelvin. This thing's millions of years old. That's the star. So where's the...

823
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:34,220
So this is 55 cankri Janssen. This is a planet. Is this it?

824
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:44,789
55 cankri E. This thing isn't made out of diamonds.

825
01:34:44,789 --> 01:34:58,359
I mean, it looks like it's made out of wood. Let's land on it. Let's go.

826
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:29,350
I can't see shit. Am I on the planet? Oh, it's a photo!

827
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:32,710
It's because there's toxic fumes everywhere. All right, let me turn off the toxic

828
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:41,239
fumes. Atmospheres, nebula, clusters,

829
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:46,439
stars. Turn them all off. Turn off water. Turn off aurora.

830
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:50,520
Turn off planets. No, turn off comet tails. Turn off galaxies. Turn off

831
01:35:50,520 --> 01:36:01,770
spacecraft. Turn on spacecraft. I mean, it looks pretty cool.

832
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:20,310
This one's cool. I need to turn this shit back on.

833
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:32,170
Comet tails, clouds, water, aurora. Any orbits there? There are. Okay, cool.

834
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:41,899
This thing's purple. This thing's nice. Turn on the HD. Look at that.

835
01:36:41,899 --> 01:36:44,699
Is that happening right now? Is it happening right now? Hold on. Pause. Is

836
01:36:44,699 --> 01:37:16,340
it happening right now? I'm gonna have a dozen desktop

837
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:29,850
backgrounds by the time this is done. Sell them. Sell them on like a

838
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:37,159
royalty-free website. That would mean they were free. All right, hold on. What

839
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:42,250
about... Check. I want to see the blue one. The

840
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:53,340
atmospheres are off. They shouldn't be. Oh, they are. You're right. But now we

841
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:59,270
can't see like the cool blue. What's this up here? Why is there a

842
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:20,220
ring up here? What is that for? That's magnetic field. That's kind of scary.

843
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:30,220
Kitchen. How is that a kitchen? Right there. Bingo.

844
01:38:30,220 --> 01:38:40,279
Get one. Earth has one of those? That's interesting. All right, I want to

845
01:38:40,279 --> 01:38:49,189
look... Where is... Let me go over here. Hold on. I want to find a

846
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:56,520
comet. What's like a popular one? What's like a cool one?

847
01:38:57,479 --> 01:39:14,279
Haley's comet? Black hole. The Black Widow?

848
01:39:14,279 --> 01:39:23,100
We gotta go see where the Black Widow is. Holy, this is a million... Jesus.

849
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:28,939
What is that? This is bright. I can't even get away from it.

850
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:34,710
It's peering into my soul. Is this temperature like

851
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,989
20-50 million degrees or something? Wow.

852
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:43,779
That's really cool looking. Turn all that shit off. Hold on. I can't even

853
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:58,439
turn it off. It's too bright. This is a neutron star. This is a black hole.

854
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:16,979
But what is it doing? Can I land on it? This is freaking me out.

855
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:23,340
The time is changing around it. Can I land on here? I'm gonna do this

856
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:54,979
gentle. Close your eyes. What happens if I go through this?

857
01:40:54,979 --> 01:41:04,300
Well, I'm on it. This is it. Turn the mag down?

858
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:23,029
Should be reset, right? It's just ice. Ow.

859
01:41:23,029 --> 01:41:32,340
All right. Hold on. Two million degrees. Don't you guys know when something's

860
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:38,020
so cold it becomes so hot? If something is like

861
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,300
negative 50 million degrees, it's gonna burn you. It's hot.

862
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:56,949
That's true. Hold on. I want to go to... Let's go to a nebula.

863
01:41:56,949 --> 01:42:02,550
What about like, Warcraft names? There's gotta be like a thrall, right?

864
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:10,359
Damn it. Thrall? How about like, Zul'jin?

865
01:42:10,359 --> 01:43:06,100
No. Jaraxxus? We're gonna find one. Come on. Come on.

866
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:14,250
How would I know these Warcraft names? Sagittarius.

867
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:25,739
All right, let's go. Holy shit. Should I go into that?

868
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:51,750
I got a good photo of this. That's so insane that this shit exists.

869
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:55,189
Oh, no. That's ingrown. That's ingrown. You're gonna have to just get tweezers to

870
01:43:55,189 --> 01:44:00,409
get that one out. Nah, I can't help you there. You're

871
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:25,899
gonna have to go to a doctor, man. Negative 566. Give me a break.

872
01:44:25,899 --> 01:44:40,920
Oh, give me a fucking break. What? I've made like three jokes. Oh, that's

873
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:51,560
bright. I gotta get the fuck away from

874
01:44:51,560 --> 01:45:06,680
this. Whoa. Okay, that's cool. It's like a

875
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,479
lightning bolt going through this thing. That's crazy.

876
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:19,100
Land? Is this shit gonna start absorbing planets

877
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:36,659
and stars and stuff? That's crazy. All right, this actually is a perfect

878
01:45:36,659 --> 01:45:56,170
home run. Right here. That looks great. I think that's the background

879
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:01,979
right there. I'm gonna land in it. I'm gonna turn

880
01:46:01,979 --> 01:46:12,970
the exposure down. I'm going in. Let's see what happens. Wish me luck. I

881
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:14,569
think it actually is like sucking me in.

882
01:46:14,569 --> 01:46:39,979
It just sucked me in. Where do I go? Can I leave?

883
01:46:39,979 --> 01:47:25,560
Where the hell am I? What? This is Sagittarius A?

884
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:43,350
I'm following Sagittarius A. Oh, no. I clicked. I must have. I clicked

885
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:53,210
something else. No. Well, I got the photo. Yeah, go to.

886
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:56,890
What the hell? Go back out. Go back. No, no. Back out. Go back out. I want to see

887
01:47:56,890 --> 01:48:03,369
that again. Go back out. That was potentially even

888
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:22,569
cooler than when I came in. What's this one?

889
01:48:22,569 --> 01:48:28,439
Any of these have names? What? What do you mean the Milky Way?

890
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:44,119
That's a Milky Way? Oh, is it not? Is this the Milky Way?

891
01:48:44,119 --> 01:48:51,579
This is the Milky Way? This is our galaxy.

892
01:48:51,579 --> 01:49:11,050
I thought we were in a different galaxy. Blue main sequence star.

893
01:49:11,050 --> 01:49:42,579
There it is. How far can I go out? I'll turn down the magnitude a little bit.

894
01:49:42,579 --> 01:49:46,260
How much can I go? There's the Milky Way right there.

895
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:57,260
What happens when you go to the end? There can't be this many things, right?

896
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:05,239
No, there's no way. There's no way. How?

897
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:11,590
These are all galaxies. No, there's no way. If this is true,

898
01:50:11,590 --> 01:50:22,890
no, if this is true, then we're actually like bugs in a petri dish.

899
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:31,979
All this shit? No, somebody sneezed and they scooped it up and put it under

900
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:35,140
a microscope and we just happened to be one of these.

901
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:52,600
Look at this shit. Let's go to this one. Look at this red one.

902
01:50:52,600 --> 01:51:08,359
We're going to go to this red one. This is right here. What is this one?

903
01:51:08,359 --> 01:51:16,729
Infinite galaxies. Somewhere on some computer is somebody else

904
01:51:16,729 --> 01:51:25,130
playing this same game and he came across. No, he's not. He's not going

905
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:32,180
to come across Earth ever. That's not possible. Aliens? How come

906
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:37,819
aliens haven't found us yet? Oh, I don't know. Why do you think?

907
01:51:41,850 --> 01:51:47,909
It's the equivalent of getting rained on outside. You know, if aliens existed,

908
01:51:47,909 --> 01:51:58,199
they would have already found us. Oh, really? Wouldn't they have?

909
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:03,239
This is a blizzard. Can you pick me out one individual snowflake that's going

910
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:12,470
by right now? You know, they would have had some

911
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:15,829
means of communication. You think that some aliens would

912
01:52:15,829 --> 01:52:18,329
have some means of communication? You think so.

913
01:52:18,329 --> 01:52:24,060
You know the telephone was invented like fucking like 70 years ago, right?

914
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:28,329
And we can only talk to like other assholes on this planet.

915
01:52:30,060 --> 01:52:33,659
You know how long this shit would take? Well, some of them have been around.

916
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:35,979
I guarantee you some of them don't even have a damn telephone. They still

917
01:52:35,979 --> 01:52:38,460
scream at each other out their windows in alien space.

918
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:42,729
Why do we have this weird fantasy world that aliens have technology that

919
01:52:42,729 --> 01:52:49,909
can make a cell phone call like 500 trillion light years away?

920
01:52:49,909 --> 01:52:53,140
You lose cell phone coverage when you go through a tunnel.

921
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:57,460
And we are literally seen as like the most advanced fucking species on our

922
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:00,729
planet. You think somebody else is going

923
01:53:00,729 --> 01:53:20,439
to have better technology? No fucking way. He knows too much.

924
01:53:20,439 --> 01:53:35,960
What is this? All right, this is the one. This is Galaxy RG 06229807.

925
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:57,750
Well, let's get in there. Let me in there. I can't get in here?

926
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:07,670
Increase the brightness? Are there no planets in this galaxy?

927
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:23,420
There's nothing even here. It's just gas and hairspray.

928
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:29,100
I wonder why we haven't had a fucking phone call from Dave the Alien.

929
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:33,460
There's no gas out here. There's nobody out here. Wait, hold on.

930
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:59,689
This is a star. Cut his mic. Cut his mic. Imagine being on one of these planets

931
01:54:59,689 --> 01:55:09,590
though. That would suck. Look at how shitty this

932
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:14,920
fucking planet is. Imagine you lived here. This is the

933
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:18,619
equivalent of living like in the middle of Nebraska.

934
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:30,489
There ain't nothing cool here. Come on, fly there. I'm pressing G.

935
01:55:30,489 --> 01:55:37,659
Can I not go to this one? Oh, it's because I'm not going fast enough.

936
01:55:37,659 --> 01:55:54,680
Oh, this one's pretty. Okay, why can't I move? Dude, look at this thing.

937
01:55:54,680 --> 01:56:21,079
This thing sucks. How hot is it here? Caramel popcorn. These are parts of space

938
01:56:21,079 --> 01:56:26,819
that are so far away that everything looks like a single star.

939
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:31,210
I can't wait for the fucking alien to get here because it's not going to be

940
01:56:31,210 --> 01:56:36,520
like, here they come on their spaceships

941
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:40,439
and they have they have space rifles. No, it's going to be one alien is

942
01:56:40,439 --> 01:56:42,439
going to accidentally fucking press the wrong button and he's going to

943
01:56:42,439 --> 01:56:45,479
have like a Tom Hanks beard and he's going to fall out of his

944
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:51,000
space boat. And he's not going to be able to talk to him.

945
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,760
And guys, this already probably happened.

946
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:02,039
The government like vacuumed out his brain and just like looked at it under a

947
01:57:02,039 --> 01:57:13,430
fucking computer screen. This already happened. Cut his mic.

948
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:23,510
That is a kind of cool looking planet though. It's not even that's a

949
01:57:23,510 --> 01:57:28,090
star on a planet. All right, hold on. Let's get the gas

950
01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:33,560
back here. All right, where's like the New

951
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:39,260
York City of this galaxy? Because that ain't it. Where is it?

952
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:48,600
Let's turn on the little thing here to show us. Detail. Let's see.

953
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:59,130
Give us some detail. It's a star. I know I'm looking for a planet.

954
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:14,279
All right, get this off. The government has made

955
01:58:14,279 --> 01:58:22,659
video games about aliens. We also have this weird

956
01:58:22,659 --> 01:58:27,479
picture of what is that? I'm going there. We have this like strange

957
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:30,279
picture of what aliens look like. They probably,

958
01:58:30,279 --> 01:58:38,340
for there to be aliens that exist too. I think I just found the fucking New

959
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:50,310
York City. What the? Look at that. Is this a star?

960
01:58:50,310 --> 01:58:59,369
That is a star and this is a star. Boring. Oh, nice galaxy you got here.

961
01:58:59,369 --> 01:59:09,939
You got two street lamps. Where's the cool shit? What's that?

962
01:59:09,939 --> 01:59:14,340
Warm super Jupiter. Wait, you get a super Jupiter here? Hold on.

963
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:29,159
They have a super Jupiter. I'll be the judge of that.

964
01:59:29,159 --> 01:59:53,899
All right, that's pretty. Whoa. Quick, quick, quick, quick. Take it.

965
01:59:53,899 --> 01:59:58,470
Take it like right now. Take it right now. Take it right now. Go, go, go, go, go.

966
01:59:58,470 --> 02:00:01,430
That looks awesome. I can't wait. We're gonna go over these at the end of the

967
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:31,989
stream. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Check this shit out. Come on,

968
02:00:31,989 --> 02:00:57,909
give me control. Hold on. Oh, yeah, we got it.

969
02:00:57,909 --> 02:01:05,220
Oh, here are there. Here we go. Orange super giant.

970
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:10,579
Dwarf moon. What does that mean? Look at. Wow, I was wrong.

971
02:01:10,579 --> 02:01:22,579
I had my GPS wasn't on right. It's an asteroid. So what does that do?

972
02:01:22,579 --> 02:01:39,180
A bit of a trail. Get there faster. This is a rock.

973
02:01:39,180 --> 02:01:56,170
This is a stone. What was I expecting? Oh, that's right. It's an asteroid.

974
02:01:56,170 --> 02:02:00,260
How are there even rocks out here? That's something I really don't understand.

975
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:13,369
Does this move? What is a rock doing out here? What the hell is this here for?

976
02:02:13,369 --> 02:02:16,409
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What just happened? Go back.

977
02:02:16,409 --> 02:02:19,699
Rewind. Do you see that? What the hell was that?

978
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:30,739
Something just reversed time. There was a shooting star back here.

979
02:02:30,739 --> 02:02:47,369
Wait for it. What's that fucking thing? No, just pull out.

980
02:02:47,369 --> 02:03:01,350
No, no, no. I want to go to that thing. This is another rock.

981
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:22,409
That's cool. Wait a minute. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

982
02:03:22,409 --> 02:03:27,060
Get another photo here. Looks pretty cool. That is a nice looking rock.

983
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:30,890
You're right. Although I want that like in the back.

984
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:34,250
Hold on. That's fine. This is good. It's like an ice rock.

985
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:43,319
No, I didn't get the whole thing. Take it again. I want a good close-up

986
02:03:43,319 --> 02:03:57,029
of the ice rock. Ooh, this is like a peak. That looks

987
02:03:57,029 --> 02:04:01,369
cool. Save it. It looks like shit. How does it?

988
02:04:01,369 --> 02:04:06,010
What do you mean looks like shit? You think this looks like shit?

989
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:25,369
I want to get it good. There we go. Like that. This alien life form here.

990
02:04:25,369 --> 02:04:40,180
Hold on. Give me something cool here like that. Up a little.

991
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:53,670
Drop the exposure. No, no, no. Put it back. Man.

992
02:04:53,670 --> 02:05:03,689
Drop the exposure a little bit more. Hold on. Right there. Got it.

993
02:05:03,689 --> 02:05:10,810
That's beautiful. This is beautiful. All right. Viewer's choice. Where are we

994
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:19,539
going? And what year? So basically, just

995
02:05:19,539 --> 02:05:29,399
delete that. Go to Earth's Moon 2018.

996
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:47,560
That sounds... Why 2018? Oh, shit. I'm reversing time.

997
02:05:48,329 --> 02:06:00,489
What did that... That was fucking cool. I just broke the fucking... I crashed the

998
02:06:00,489 --> 02:06:08,869
game. God damn it. Come on. Did I... Where is it? What's the matter? What was

999
02:06:08,869 --> 02:06:23,430
that an error for? I don't have an error. Okay, that's weird.

1000
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:32,579
All right. You want me to go to the moon, right? Earth Moon.

1001
02:06:32,579 --> 02:06:49,430
Go to the Earth Moon. Why 2018? What happens on 2018?

1002
02:06:49,430 --> 02:07:03,180
Where did they land? What a waste of viewer's choice. Go to the Earth Moon.

1003
02:07:03,180 --> 02:07:06,220
Well, hold on a minute here. Hold on. How fast can you walk? Like 20 miles per

1004
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:13,930
hour? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is cool.

1005
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:26,220
We get to actually see the surface of the moon. Right here.

1006
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:35,130
But what do you want me to do? Find the footsteps. I don't think they're

1007
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:50,819
gonna have that. Why 2018? Find the flag. Make a damn

1008
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:57,079
spaceship already. I didn't... Spacecraft manager? I don't

1009
02:07:57,079 --> 02:07:59,479
have one. Can I... How do I... Can I make one?

1010
02:07:59,479 --> 02:08:19,619
How do I make one? You can spawn in a spacecraft.

1011
02:08:19,619 --> 02:08:22,739
Go to the menu. Do I have to save this? Why would I have to save it? I can just

1012
02:08:22,739 --> 02:08:41,300
type in moon. Flight simulator? Build. Space engine.

1013
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:53,750
Aliens. Fire. Fire Dragonfly Starship. Build it.

1014
02:08:53,750 --> 02:09:03,739
Okay, so take control of it. What? Main engine. I didn't... I don't have

1015
02:09:03,739 --> 02:09:10,310
this tutorial. There's a lot going on here. Flight

1016
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:25,779
assist. How fast am I going? Main engines. Okay, main engines are on.

1017
02:09:25,779 --> 02:09:32,039
Thrusters. On. I'm going 2,000 miles per hour. How do I move?

1018
02:09:32,039 --> 02:09:49,640
Orp. Warp. Orp. Net 32. What is this ball of yarn over here?

1019
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:55,689
What is this? Saturn's moon? I want to go that way.

1020
02:09:55,689 --> 02:10:05,000
Saturn's moon. Land on Saturn's moon. Main engines. On.

1021
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:11,800
Dock. No docking ports available. Where are you going?

1022
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:30,869
Is it like flying itself? Select star and then click warp to.

1023
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:37,699
Normal up. Rotate to target. Kill rotation.

1024
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:44,170
Switch view. Here we go. View ship trajectory.

1025
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:53,930
Oh, all right. Switch view. Okay, and then warp.

1026
02:10:53,930 --> 02:11:00,920
I'm warping here. All right, here we go. Main engines at 100.

1027
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:19,210
Thrusters. Engaged. Go for it. Do I have to do anything else?

1028
02:11:19,210 --> 02:11:34,869
Or will it just do it on its own? Is it going to crash?

1029
02:11:34,869 --> 02:11:42,500
Am I going to crash into this planet? Yeah, I'm fine.

1030
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:50,229
That's what it looks like on the inside, huh? Shredded tax documents.

1031
02:11:50,869 --> 02:11:57,659
Wow. So this is like the shredder planet. Cool. All right, let's push it.

1032
02:11:57,659 --> 02:12:08,810
Push the planet. I can't push the planet. How about orb? Oh, that's orbit.

1033
02:12:08,810 --> 02:12:11,619
What about H-O-R? What does that mean?

1034
02:12:14,819 --> 02:12:27,000
Whore. What is whore? What is whore? All right, go that way.

1035
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:39,180
Well, all right. Well, I can right click and land.

1036
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:45,670
Am I still on the spaceship? Oh, is that my spaceship's out here.

1037
02:12:51,159 --> 02:12:57,220
Okay. Well, that was fun. I jumped out of the spaceship into the space.

1038
02:12:57,779 --> 02:13:20,069
What is the planetarium? Why does the moon look like this now?

1039
02:13:20,069 --> 02:13:34,699
Oh, it's just there. All right, I want to go to two more places.

1040
02:13:34,699 --> 02:13:38,810
And then I'm going to do something else. This is fun, though.

1041
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:53,260
No, like five more places. Go to the year 2077.

1042
02:13:53,979 --> 02:14:05,020
Earth. There's a Sauron? Where is it?

1043
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:09,319
Well, that's a lot stupider than I thought it was going to be.

1044
02:14:09,479 --> 02:14:22,550
Stupid's the wrong word. Listen, what is that down there?

1045
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:25,180
All right. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1046
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:33,739
We've got red blood land cluster and then big orange.

1047
02:14:33,739 --> 02:14:43,479
Let's go red. Type diffuse. California nebula.

1048
02:14:43,479 --> 02:14:55,739
Let's go. What's this one? G1. Yellow giant. Star Capella.

1049
02:14:55,739 --> 02:15:00,470
All right, we're going to go much faster than this.

1050
02:15:09,979 --> 02:15:12,380
I'm missing so many planets. All right, hold on.

1051
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:16,869
This is it right here. California nebula.

1052
02:15:24,579 --> 02:15:28,260
One of these days, one of these just giant red toxic poison clouds

1053
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:36,229
is just going to cross Earth's path. Shift F3.

1054
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:48,840
Search for star browsers. Go to search.

1055
02:15:50,760 --> 02:15:52,600
Oh, you can see how many stars and how many planets.

1056
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:57,479
Life. Hold on, there's life on some of these planets?

1057
02:15:57,479 --> 02:15:59,720
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What do you mean life?

1058
02:16:07,899 --> 02:16:18,869
Wait, wait, wait. This for planet A3.

1059
02:16:18,869 --> 02:16:21,270
All right, hold on. We'll close this for a second.

1060
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:27,850
I want to check out the red fumes. What's in the red fumes?

1061
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:43,239
Something in here. Star. I'm not going to say that.

1062
02:16:43,239 --> 02:16:47,799
I was going to say Final Fantasy, but I'm already just barely

1063
02:16:47,799 --> 02:16:49,879
breaking even right now on the joke meter,

1064
02:16:49,879 --> 02:16:51,719
and I don't want to cause a problem on that.

1065
02:16:58,219 --> 02:17:00,219
I didn't do anything. You can't just write minus two.

1066
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:05,239
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.

1067
02:17:05,239 --> 02:17:12,549
No, I didn't. Oh, that's unfair. That was unfair minus twos.

1068
02:17:13,940 --> 02:17:14,979
All right, I want to see what this is.

1069
02:17:15,620 --> 02:17:29,559
Percy. Let's see what Percy is.

1070
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,940
Percy is actually pretty cool looking.

1071
02:17:43,719 --> 02:17:52,540
Whoa. I want it right on the left side there.

1072
02:17:53,180 --> 02:17:55,260
I want that in the background too, like this.

1073
02:17:56,219 --> 02:18:02,020
Like over here maybe. I don't know.

1074
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:03,299
I don't know. I don't know.

1075
02:18:03,299 --> 02:18:05,459
I don't know. I know I want that.

1076
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:08,840
Like this. I don't know.

1077
02:18:17,020 --> 02:18:18,700
What the hell is going on here?

1078
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:32,200
All right, this just looks like when you used to have

1079
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:35,700
a disposable camera and like six of the photos

1080
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,700
when you got them developed would look like this

1081
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:40,360
because you had to shake your fucking hand on it and shit.

1082
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:49,620
So, all right, turn it off auto.

1083
02:18:49,620 --> 02:18:50,420
That's even worse.

1084
02:18:56,809 --> 02:18:58,090
I almost want to like go.

1085
02:18:58,090 --> 02:19:01,129
Hold on. This is super duper.

1086
02:19:02,729 --> 02:19:13,500
Just take it. Take the photo.

1087
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:15,340
I can't wait until we go over these at the end

1088
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:18,459
and you just go, holy shit, he's talented.

1089
02:19:18,459 --> 02:19:25,000
All right, what was that going?

1090
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:27,639
Oh, the planet with a life on it.

1091
02:19:27,639 --> 02:19:29,340
Let's go get a sample.

1092
02:19:29,899 --> 02:19:34,010
Let's go have one of like the space cows peeing in a jar.

1093
02:19:34,569 --> 02:19:40,889
Where was that? Shift F3.

1094
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:46,659
All right, this one right here is a this system here.

1095
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:49,049
So there's life here.

1096
02:19:49,690 --> 02:19:53,299
Where the hell am I?

1097
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:55,139
Life on these planets?

1098
02:19:55,860 --> 02:20:09,750
Let me open that back up.

1099
02:20:12,489 --> 02:20:13,930
There's life on one of these planets.

1100
02:20:15,399 --> 02:20:19,239
RS8 and within one light year.

1101
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,840
Filted like there's 18 planets here.

1102
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:25,639
But what do you mean life?

1103
02:20:27,799 --> 02:20:29,719
251. Like that's where I am.

1104
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:39,989
But like which one of these has life on it?

1105
02:20:39,989 --> 02:20:40,870
Barrie Center?

1106
02:20:41,430 --> 02:20:50,979
What the hell is this?

1107
02:20:51,620 --> 02:21:12,020
Well, get there.

1108
02:21:12,020 --> 02:21:12,420
Let's go.

1109
02:21:12,420 --> 02:21:15,739
Gee, take me to the Barrie Center.

1110
02:21:15,739 --> 02:21:17,020
What the hell is going on here?

1111
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:19,459
Here we go.

1112
02:21:19,459 --> 02:21:21,020
Does it say if there's life on it?

1113
02:21:21,579 --> 02:21:32,010
All right, there's life on this planet.

1114
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:35,139
Oh, life on this one.

1115
02:21:47,620 --> 02:21:48,340
The timing.

1116
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:48,819
Wait, did it?

1117
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:50,979
Oh, I want to see.

1118
02:21:50,979 --> 02:21:51,620
Clip it.

1119
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:52,340
I want to see it.

1120
02:21:53,799 --> 02:21:54,680
I want to see that.

1121
02:21:55,700 --> 02:22:26,180
I want to see it.

1122
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:27,620
That's so stupid.

1123
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:40,459
It's like I had a button queued up

1124
02:22:40,459 --> 02:22:41,899
and pressed it at the perfect time.

1125
02:22:41,899 --> 02:22:42,219
All right.

1126
02:22:42,860 --> 02:22:48,340
I need to find the life on this damn planet.

1127
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:55,879
No, not the main menu yet, dummy.

1128
02:22:57,959 --> 02:22:58,440
F2.

1129
02:22:59,959 --> 02:23:01,000
Let me check this one.

1130
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:05,450
Green text in Barrie Center.

1131
02:23:06,090 --> 02:23:07,290
All right, there's apparently life here.

1132
02:23:11,350 --> 02:23:13,510
Let's take this down to like 10 times

1133
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:14,629
and let's go explore the planet.

1134
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:17,829
There's life on this planet.

1135
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:25,500
How do I find it?

1136
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:35,909
Is it just water?

1137
02:23:35,909 --> 02:23:43,620
I swear to God if an alien shows up.

1138
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:44,100
Found it.

1139
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:44,819
Look at that.

1140
02:23:44,819 --> 02:23:46,780
It's like a snow snow.

1141
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:47,739
It's a crack.

1142
02:23:47,739 --> 02:23:51,100
I thought it was a snake.

1143
02:23:51,100 --> 02:24:01,059
Is it like a life-o-meter?

1144
02:24:01,059 --> 02:24:03,930
Can I pull up a thing to see if I can find it somewhere?

1145
02:24:03,930 --> 02:24:11,209
The moons have life, but you won't see it.

1146
02:24:18,340 --> 02:24:19,620
No life on this planet.

1147
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:20,739
Go to the moons.

1148
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:26,420
Go to moon.

1149
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:27,059
All right.

1150
02:24:27,059 --> 02:24:30,020
Wait, I think those are those life orbs.

1151
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:35,000
How could there be life on this planet?

1152
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,440
Shit can't live on this.

1153
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:40,379
How on earth are you supposed to live

1154
02:24:40,379 --> 02:24:42,299
on top of Nickelodeon Floam?

1155
02:24:42,299 --> 02:24:43,100
I don't understand.

1156
02:24:43,739 --> 02:24:44,860
Does it make any sense to me?

1157
02:25:01,479 --> 02:25:02,360
That was funny.

1158
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:02,760
It was.

1159
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:03,639
You just don't get it.

1160
02:25:03,639 --> 02:25:04,200
You just don't get it.

1161
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:05,559
You didn't have Floam when you were a kid.

1162
02:25:05,559 --> 02:25:07,639
It hasn't existed in like 15 years.

1163
02:25:07,639 --> 02:25:11,190
I feel like this is a conspiracy against me today.

1164
02:25:15,379 --> 02:25:16,659
There's a joke conspiracy against me

1165
02:25:16,659 --> 02:25:18,020
ever since we started talking about it.

1166
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:28,329
It's actually kind of cool looking.

1167
02:25:28,329 --> 02:25:29,770
You think we're under 15?

1168
02:25:30,489 --> 02:25:30,729
No.

1169
02:25:32,409 --> 02:25:37,239
Nobody had Floam and I didn't even have Floam.

1170
02:25:37,239 --> 02:25:41,430
I had it for like an hour.

1171
02:25:41,430 --> 02:25:42,709
I've liked that one.

1172
02:25:42,709 --> 02:25:44,069
I'm keeping that one.

1173
02:25:44,069 --> 02:25:46,680
All right.

1174
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:47,479
Let me turn off the...

1175
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,399
That actually looks kind of good.

1176
02:25:49,879 --> 02:25:52,899
No, but I didn't have it though.

1177
02:25:52,899 --> 02:25:53,780
Somebody brought it over.

1178
02:25:55,479 --> 02:25:57,000
Somebody brought it over

1179
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:57,959
and they took it out of the package

1180
02:25:57,959 --> 02:25:59,079
and we were playing it

1181
02:25:59,079 --> 02:26:00,680
and I stole some.

1182
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,799
When they went to the bathroom

1183
02:26:01,799 --> 02:26:04,120
I pulled off like a little corner of it

1184
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:05,799
and then spread the rest of it out

1185
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:06,760
inside the container

1186
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:09,000
so it looked like there was nothing missing.

1187
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,510
Then I put it into a little shoe box

1188
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:13,270
and then I had my own Nickelodeon Floam.

1189
02:26:30,409 --> 02:26:30,729
All right.

1190
02:26:31,530 --> 02:26:33,450
Let me go ahead and tell you something here.

1191
02:26:34,250 --> 02:26:37,290
Me telling you about a bad thing I did

1192
02:26:37,290 --> 02:26:39,239
when I was younger

1193
02:26:39,239 --> 02:26:42,440
is not a minus two scenario.

1194
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:51,379
Oh, I can't believe you did that bad thing

1195
02:26:51,379 --> 02:26:52,180
when you were a kid.

1196
02:26:53,049 --> 02:26:54,569
That wasn't a funny joke.

1197
02:26:54,569 --> 02:26:56,729
Oh, am I dead?

1198
02:26:56,729 --> 02:26:59,379
Is Dream dead?

1199
02:26:59,379 --> 02:27:07,079
Yeah, guys.

1200
02:27:07,079 --> 02:27:10,649
One time I ate a bowl of fucking cereal.

1201
02:27:10,649 --> 02:27:13,510
Yeah.

1202
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:14,149
Minus two.

1203
02:27:28,940 --> 02:27:30,059
Theft isn't funny.

1204
02:27:30,059 --> 02:27:31,180
It's not a...

1205
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:31,819
Yeah.

1206
02:27:31,819 --> 02:27:32,860
It's not a joke.

1207
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,780
Theft is not a joke.

1208
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:36,940
Therefore, there's no reason for it to be a joke

1209
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:38,700
and I'm stuck in the quicksand.

1210
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:51,049
I'm climbing back by the end of this stream.

1211
02:27:52,659 --> 02:27:53,459
I ain't going to let this...

1212
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:55,379
Oh, this looks good.

1213
02:27:55,379 --> 02:27:58,969
How about right here?

1214
02:27:58,969 --> 02:28:00,889
Everyone's working against me now

1215
02:28:00,889 --> 02:28:02,950
because they know, oh, he wants to try to break even

1216
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:03,829
on the Joko meter.

1217
02:28:03,829 --> 02:28:05,110
Oh, I'm not going to let that happen

1218
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:07,110
every time he says something I can say minus two.

1219
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:19,930
Let me go...

1220
02:28:20,889 --> 02:28:22,459
Let me go where...

1221
02:28:22,459 --> 02:28:23,180
Let's go here.

1222
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:23,979
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1223
02:28:23,979 --> 02:28:24,540
What was the...

1224
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:28,260
Let me look at this.

1225
02:28:28,260 --> 02:28:32,620
Oh, there's an egg.

1226
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:34,780
There's an egg nebula.

1227
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:35,500
Let's go.

1228
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:44,729
Holy shit, you ate a bowl of cereal.

1229
02:28:44,729 --> 02:28:46,489
Fucking plus two.

1230
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:51,739
Hey, guys.

1231
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:53,979
Do you like Coca-Cola?

1232
02:28:53,979 --> 02:28:54,479
Me too.

1233
02:28:57,719 --> 02:29:03,540
Give me a fucking break.

1234
02:29:19,819 --> 02:29:23,860
I'm definitely going to get a picture of this.

1235
02:29:23,860 --> 02:29:27,639
This is fucking so stupid.

1236
02:29:30,649 --> 02:29:32,170
So fucking funny.

1237
02:29:32,170 --> 02:29:33,370
Minus two Pepsi is better,

1238
02:29:33,370 --> 02:29:33,930
but that's like...

1239
02:29:34,979 --> 02:29:36,659
Opinions aren't jokes either.

1240
02:29:39,819 --> 02:29:44,540
You know, I thought Endgame was like a really good movie.

1241
02:29:44,540 --> 02:29:45,260
Minus two.

1242
02:29:46,469 --> 02:29:47,270
No, no, what?

1243
02:29:49,299 --> 02:29:50,260
That's not a joke.

1244
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:52,889
No, stop doing...

1245
02:29:52,889 --> 02:30:03,829
No, no, no, no, no.

1246
02:30:03,829 --> 02:30:05,590
He's got opinions.

1247
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:06,950
All right, let's get in the egg nebula.

1248
02:30:12,459 --> 02:30:16,059
I wonder if we can find some spies inside the egg nebula.

1249
02:30:16,059 --> 02:30:17,180
I wonder if that's possible.

1250
02:30:32,440 --> 02:30:33,319
That's guaranteed.

1251
02:30:33,319 --> 02:30:34,040
I will game...

1252
02:30:34,040 --> 02:30:34,760
You want to game...

1253
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:35,639
You want to game me?

1254
02:30:35,639 --> 02:30:36,840
I'm going to game you.

1255
02:30:36,840 --> 02:30:40,069
I will get that to positive by the end of the stream.

1256
02:30:44,500 --> 02:30:45,620
You're already falling for it.

1257
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:46,340
I already got you.

1258
02:30:50,739 --> 02:30:53,139
Washed up streamer gives into nostalgia.

1259
02:30:53,139 --> 02:31:01,319
What are we at?

1260
02:31:01,319 --> 02:31:01,799
What are we at?

1261
02:31:01,799 --> 02:31:02,760
What's the total?

1262
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:03,559
Let me see your total.

1263
02:31:06,180 --> 02:31:07,780
I'm deleting that, by the way.

1264
02:31:07,780 --> 02:31:08,579
That's like...

1265
02:31:08,579 --> 02:31:11,379
That is like the self-conscious mode active.

1266
02:31:12,020 --> 02:31:19,780
I got to look over here and just like, wait a minute.

1267
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:20,180
Where am I?

1268
02:31:20,180 --> 02:31:21,700
Am I at my funny score?

1269
02:31:22,569 --> 02:31:25,129
I don't want to have to have that climbing up my ass.

1270
02:31:31,639 --> 02:31:34,360
Or I only want that available at the end of the stream.

1271
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:38,309
That's going to put too much pressure on me.

1272
02:31:38,309 --> 02:31:40,149
I'm going to look over and it's going to be like, oh, total.

1273
02:31:40,149 --> 02:31:42,870
Wow, he sucks.

1274
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:44,069
No, no, I don't.

1275
02:31:44,069 --> 02:31:45,190
I don't suck, do I?

1276
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:54,940
Let's go on this one.

1277
02:31:54,940 --> 02:31:55,659
That's worse.

1278
02:31:56,459 --> 02:32:15,239
Look, I know this looks like the gravel circle in Garden Flipper.

1279
02:32:15,239 --> 02:32:18,659
That's just an observation.

1280
02:32:18,659 --> 02:32:19,459
I'm not making a joke.

1281
02:32:19,459 --> 02:32:20,340
That's an observation.

1282
02:32:20,899 --> 02:32:34,340
Come on, I want to get like a...

1283
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:36,940
Can I take the atmosphere on?

1284
02:32:41,579 --> 02:32:42,700
Let me see what happens when I do this.

1285
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,959
No, it doesn't help.

1286
02:32:45,959 --> 02:32:46,440
Doesn't help.

1287
02:32:53,530 --> 02:32:55,209
Go to the sun and see if it's super nervous.

1288
02:32:56,069 --> 02:33:06,139
I don't think any actual things happen in the game.

1289
02:33:06,139 --> 02:33:08,620
I think it just is interesting to do.

1290
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:10,620
I think there's certain events that you can see.

1291
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:15,209
Maybe there's no like physics simulation.

1292
02:33:15,209 --> 02:33:17,450
Yeah, nothing currently aware of.

1293
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:18,250
This is a cool planet.

1294
02:33:18,809 --> 02:33:22,920
I get this one like a D minus, like a C plus, maybe.

1295
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:32,819
Turn back on the magnitude.

1296
02:33:33,379 --> 02:33:34,340
I'm like very far away.

1297
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:35,139
Hold on.

1298
02:33:35,139 --> 02:33:40,229
What am I?

1299
02:33:40,229 --> 02:33:41,270
I'm like lost here.

1300
02:33:41,989 --> 02:33:44,500
There we go.

1301
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:48,469
What am I going to go?

1302
02:33:49,190 --> 02:33:57,530
I should play universe sandbox.

1303
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:00,780
I could check that out eventually.

1304
02:34:01,659 --> 02:34:05,420
That star took billions of years to form and you gave it a D minus.

1305
02:34:09,139 --> 02:34:12,809
Yeah, and what's the problem?

1306
02:34:14,819 --> 02:34:15,620
I don't see a problem.

1307
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:24,180
That's rude.

1308
02:34:27,530 --> 02:34:29,450
Planets don't have feelings.

1309
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:39,700
They have bottles of gas, water, and vapor.

1310
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:44,020
They don't get sad about not being cool.

1311
02:34:44,659 --> 02:34:50,659
I'll tell you what is cool.

1312
02:34:50,659 --> 02:34:51,379
This.

1313
02:34:51,379 --> 02:34:52,979
Let's get a good view of this.

1314
02:34:53,540 --> 02:35:02,940
It looks like a double star here.

1315
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:05,290
I got to drop.

1316
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:05,930
Oh, hold on.

1317
02:35:06,569 --> 02:35:07,129
I like this.

1318
02:35:07,770 --> 02:35:11,670
Slow it down a little.

1319
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:15,610
Get up.

1320
02:35:15,610 --> 02:35:15,930
Maybe.

1321
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:16,170
Nah.

1322
02:35:16,170 --> 02:35:16,889
What am I going to go?

1323
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:24,840
Right in here.

1324
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:26,120
And let's zoom it out a little bit.

1325
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:30,250
And then I want to turn on.

1326
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:36,620
I mean like that's again from your disposable camera.

1327
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:37,659
You took a picture of the sun.

1328
02:35:38,299 --> 02:35:44,120
I've got I got an idea for a stream.

1329
02:35:44,680 --> 02:35:46,860
Oh yeah.

1330
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:47,739
This is going to happen.

1331
02:35:48,729 --> 02:35:50,010
Oh, this is going to happen real soon.

1332
02:35:50,569 --> 02:35:54,200
I'm not even doing anything.

1333
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:57,659
Everyone's this is you guys a game in the system here.

1334
02:35:58,520 --> 02:36:03,719
I'm going to buy like five disposable cameras and like go on a trip.

1335
02:36:04,600 --> 02:36:06,760
And I'm not going to I'm going to develop them.

1336
02:36:07,879 --> 02:36:11,879
And then I'm going to show you I'm going to show up to you on stream.

1337
02:36:11,879 --> 02:36:26,709
I'm going to go like this.

1338
02:36:27,430 --> 02:36:32,299
No more magnitude.

1339
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:38,219
What is that?

1340
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:41,129
No, I want that looks all right.

1341
02:36:43,350 --> 02:36:43,989
Fire watch.

1342
02:36:43,989 --> 02:36:47,670
Yeah, but the difference with fire watch is those are taken in the game.

1343
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:52,340
Like I'm going to really go on like a trip.

1344
02:36:58,420 --> 02:36:59,370
Oh, shit.

1345
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:01,959
All right.

1346
02:37:01,959 --> 02:37:02,360
What do you say?

1347
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:02,760
What do you say?

1348
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:05,559
Like about five minutes of this and I'm going to just go to the bathroom.

1349
02:37:05,559 --> 02:37:06,920
We'll come back and do something else.

1350
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:14,600
All right.

1351
02:37:14,600 --> 02:37:18,520
I'm going to we're going to type in random letters here because the just

1352
02:37:18,520 --> 02:37:20,120
I'm going to just whatever you have in chat here.

1353
02:37:26,920 --> 02:37:27,559
I see J.

1354
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:32,520
I see Q.

1355
02:37:37,159 --> 02:37:37,559
J.

1356
02:37:37,559 --> 02:37:37,879
Q.

1357
02:37:43,420 --> 02:37:43,819
Damn it.

1358
02:37:50,899 --> 02:37:51,219
J.

1359
02:37:51,219 --> 02:37:51,459
S.

1360
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:55,020
J.

1361
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:57,420
S one eight three B.

1362
02:37:58,139 --> 02:38:03,370
And then I'm going to go as fast as I possibly can and try to get to the end of the world.

1363
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,329
Now, that's a cool looking fucking zone.

1364
02:38:07,799 --> 02:38:11,829
I can't wait to level up here.

1365
02:38:11,829 --> 02:38:13,270
What's the level limit?

1366
02:38:13,270 --> 02:38:13,989
10 to 25.

1367
02:38:14,629 --> 02:38:14,790
Nice.

1368
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:15,350
You want to go here?

1369
02:38:16,309 --> 02:38:16,709
Nice.

1370
02:38:16,709 --> 02:38:17,270
I do too.

1371
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:22,260
Bullshit.

1372
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:23,540
You guys are liars.

1373
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:24,180
Liars.

1374
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:24,579
Liars.

1375
02:38:24,579 --> 02:38:25,059
All of you.

1376
02:38:25,799 --> 02:38:29,879
I don't care about some arbitrary rating system.

1377
02:38:29,879 --> 02:38:50,940
I want to get like in here though.

1378
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:52,059
Now, that's an awesome view.

1379
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:54,260
Let's go in here.

1380
02:39:01,750 --> 02:39:02,709
It does look like Neptune.

1381
02:39:03,350 --> 02:39:06,329
Go see Messier 82.

1382
02:39:06,969 --> 02:39:14,069
I'll check it out.

1383
02:39:20,659 --> 02:39:27,909
I haven't even gone to see like Jupiter and Mars and stuff.

1384
02:39:27,909 --> 02:39:29,350
Messier 82.

1385
02:39:29,350 --> 02:39:30,069
Let's try it.

1386
02:39:30,069 --> 02:39:37,209
I don't know.

1387
02:39:37,209 --> 02:39:37,930
Where is it?

1388
02:39:37,930 --> 02:39:46,010
It's not here.

1389
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:46,569
There's nothing here.

1390
02:39:48,409 --> 02:39:49,290
M82.

1391
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:59,180
That's a pretty good chat's choice.

1392
02:39:59,180 --> 02:40:11,770
This looks good.

1393
02:40:11,770 --> 02:40:16,659
Pick at that.

1394
02:40:16,659 --> 02:40:16,979
Okay.

1395
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:25,610
What about anything in here that's interesting to see?

1396
02:40:25,610 --> 02:40:38,200
It's cool.

1397
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:46,729
A crab nebula?

1398
02:40:46,729 --> 02:40:48,010
I think I feel like I've seen this before.

1399
02:40:58,469 --> 02:40:59,989
It's cool looking I guess.

1400
02:40:59,989 --> 02:41:05,670
What's the one back here?

1401
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:13,319
If you call something a crab nebula, don't you expect it to have claws

1402
02:41:13,319 --> 02:41:14,760
or look kind of like a crab?

1403
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:16,120
Why would it be crab nebula?

1404
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:24,280
What is this thing in here?

1405
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:32,940
Can't even click it.

1406
02:41:32,940 --> 02:41:35,750
Not even clickable.

1407
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:36,549
There it is.

1408
02:41:36,549 --> 02:41:40,600
I want to check this one out.

1409
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:46,379
And I'm going to fly to this one.

1410
02:41:46,379 --> 02:41:48,420
Oh, this is cool.

1411
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:49,700
This one is nice.

1412
02:41:49,700 --> 02:42:10,620
I want to fly like hordes of right there.

1413
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:11,340
Right there.

1414
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:11,899
Hold on.

1415
02:42:11,899 --> 02:42:22,020
I'll get out of here.

1416
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:22,739
That's perfect.

1417
02:42:27,399 --> 02:42:28,520
What is that?

1418
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:33,739
This feels like it doesn't belong.

1419
02:42:33,739 --> 02:42:35,579
I feel like this is an error in the game.

1420
02:42:35,579 --> 02:42:39,479
This is chewed up bubble gum that the developer accidentally left here.

1421
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:47,909
I mean, it's cool looking.

1422
02:42:47,909 --> 02:42:49,510
Wait, I can get a pretty good picture here I think.

1423
02:43:15,799 --> 02:43:16,360
Looks pretty nice.

1424
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:21,129
All right, cool.

1425
02:43:21,129 --> 02:43:21,770
All right.

1426
02:43:21,770 --> 02:43:30,120
What's the last place I'm going?

1427
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:32,120
Somebody said the spirit of creation.

1428
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:32,600
Whatever.

1429
02:43:32,600 --> 02:43:39,379
Something of creation.

1430
02:43:39,379 --> 02:43:40,739
Pillars of creation.

1431
02:43:40,739 --> 02:43:48,100
This is huge.

1432
02:43:48,100 --> 02:43:51,049
What the hell?

1433
02:43:51,049 --> 02:43:57,620
Is this a giant E?

1434
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,180
E.

1435
02:43:58,180 --> 02:44:07,959
I'm still loading in shit.

1436
02:44:07,959 --> 02:44:26,229
What the hell is that?

1437
02:44:26,229 --> 02:44:27,110
How big is this?

1438
02:44:39,559 --> 02:44:41,079
That's huge.

1439
02:44:41,079 --> 02:44:51,139
Yeah, this is the Milky Way.

1440
02:44:51,139 --> 02:44:51,639
Wow.

1441
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:54,899
All right.

1442
02:44:54,899 --> 02:44:55,219
Okay.

1443
02:44:55,219 --> 02:44:55,700
All right.

1444
02:44:55,700 --> 02:44:56,180
All right.

1445
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:56,500
All right.

1446
02:44:56,500 --> 02:44:57,059
Yeah, I know.

1447
02:45:09,239 --> 02:45:10,920
I know it's our galaxy.

1448
02:45:10,920 --> 02:45:14,280
I just didn't know that like the crab nebula or I don't know.

1449
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:19,639
I haven't taken like fucking ninth grade geography since the ninth grade.

1450
02:45:19,639 --> 02:45:20,840
I don't know that.

1451
02:45:21,399 --> 02:45:22,280
Why would I know that?

1452
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:29,110
I haven't opened up like a ninth grade science book since I was in the ninth grade.

1453
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:33,350
I don't remember that the pillars of creation are in our galaxy.

1454
02:45:36,979 --> 02:45:41,129
Why would I have that information right now?

1455
02:45:41,129 --> 02:45:46,040
Why would I remember this?

1456
02:45:46,040 --> 02:45:47,319
Click the flag.

1457
02:45:47,399 --> 02:45:48,920
I'm scared to click the flag.

1458
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:50,569
Okay.

1459
02:45:50,569 --> 02:45:51,290
I can click the flag.

1460
02:45:51,290 --> 02:45:52,170
Wait, is that my address?

1461
02:45:58,409 --> 02:46:00,969
I saw my location.

1462
02:46:00,969 --> 02:46:04,010
I saw my location and I fucking freaked out.

1463
02:46:04,010 --> 02:46:04,329
Okay.

1464
02:46:05,610 --> 02:46:06,489
Spare me.

1465
02:46:06,489 --> 02:46:12,040
All right.

1466
02:46:12,040 --> 02:46:13,239
Look at the pillars of creation.

1467
02:46:16,860 --> 02:46:17,979
We saw that one.

1468
02:46:17,979 --> 02:46:19,340
Sunrise in hell.

1469
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:33,459
Holy shit.

1470
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:39,219
Good photo op coming up here I think in a fast forward time frame.

1471
02:46:39,219 --> 02:46:39,620
Watch this.

1472
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:40,180
Wait, wait, wait.

1473
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:42,840
Oh, hold on.

1474
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:43,959
I don't even care where I am.

1475
02:46:43,959 --> 02:46:44,760
Who cares?

1476
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:50,620
I would laugh so hard if I had a face on it.

1477
02:46:50,620 --> 02:47:22,579
I'll come back.

1478
02:47:22,579 --> 02:47:33,260
Come on and hurry up.

1479
02:47:33,260 --> 02:47:37,159
Come on.

1480
02:47:37,159 --> 02:47:38,040
Where is it?

1481
02:47:38,040 --> 02:47:39,780
Where did it go?

1482
02:47:39,780 --> 02:48:00,020
Here we go.

1483
02:48:00,020 --> 02:48:00,659
Ready?

1484
02:48:00,659 --> 02:48:07,750
Find me a better picture from anyone that's ever played this game.

1485
02:48:08,309 --> 02:48:26,250
That's going to be featured in a magazine.

1486
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:33,100
Go to the Great Wall?

1487
02:48:33,100 --> 02:48:33,420
Hold on.

1488
02:48:35,020 --> 02:48:36,299
Let me see what this is even first.

1489
02:48:36,299 --> 02:48:37,020
Hold on.

1490
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:40,200
This is like a lava gallery.

1491
02:48:40,200 --> 02:48:41,799
No, this is a crab galaxy.

1492
02:48:41,799 --> 02:48:43,020
Okay.

1493
02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:46,139
If it were me making the rules, this would be the crab nebula.

1494
02:48:46,139 --> 02:48:46,860
Take a look.

1495
02:48:46,860 --> 02:48:48,969
This is a crab.

1496
02:48:48,969 --> 02:48:50,809
Just for everyone to make sure they understand this.

1497
02:48:51,530 --> 02:48:59,270
This is crab nebula to me.

1498
02:48:59,270 --> 02:48:59,590
Why?

1499
02:48:59,590 --> 02:49:01,270
I just did like a loop-de-loop.

1500
02:49:01,270 --> 02:49:02,069
Why?

1501
02:49:02,069 --> 02:49:05,500
I'm going to fucking throw up here.

1502
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:06,059
What's going on?

1503
02:49:08,620 --> 02:49:09,819
Where am I going?

1504
02:49:09,819 --> 02:49:20,309
Where am I going?

1505
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:21,030
I don't understand.

1506
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:22,629
Where am I going?

1507
02:49:22,629 --> 02:49:32,840
Oh, this is Beetlejuice 3 is the name of this planet.

1508
02:49:32,840 --> 02:49:33,879
Oh, god damn it.

1509
02:49:33,879 --> 02:49:34,520
No, no, no.

1510
02:49:34,520 --> 02:49:35,559
Not Beetlejuice 3.

1511
02:49:41,989 --> 02:49:43,829
Just wait for it any minute now.

1512
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:49,879
It's not how many times you say it.

1513
02:49:49,879 --> 02:49:51,639
It's the planet number.

1514
02:49:51,639 --> 02:50:00,440
Hold on.

1515
02:50:00,440 --> 02:50:04,059
Where is he?

1516
02:50:04,059 --> 02:50:06,840
Where is he?

1517
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:07,319
I don't...

1518
02:50:09,620 --> 02:50:10,899
I'm dying this music.

1519
02:50:13,129 --> 02:50:13,690
Is he here?

1520
02:50:16,819 --> 02:50:17,700
Where the fuck is he?

1521
02:50:23,610 --> 02:50:24,170
What the fuck?

1522
02:50:24,170 --> 02:50:24,809
Somebody at the door.

1523
02:50:26,729 --> 02:50:27,450
What the fuck?

1524
02:50:28,090 --> 02:50:29,129
Hold on.

1525
02:50:29,129 --> 02:51:02,459
Weirdly enough.

1526
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:09,030
Weirdly enough, he drives for FedEx now.

1527
02:51:10,409 --> 02:51:12,409
I actually got a couple things on Amazon.

1528
02:51:12,409 --> 02:51:17,049
So put them over here.

1529
02:51:17,049 --> 02:51:22,809
I got to do water filter.

1530
02:51:22,809 --> 02:51:24,010
So that's cool.

1531
02:51:28,329 --> 02:51:36,600
Because the water in Vegas can be kind of not so good.

1532
02:51:37,239 --> 02:51:45,180
What was going on?

1533
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:45,899
Oh, right, right, right.

1534
02:51:45,899 --> 02:51:46,459
We're going here.

1535
02:51:52,729 --> 02:51:53,770
Reused joke.

1536
02:51:58,379 --> 02:51:58,860
Come on.

1537
02:51:59,819 --> 02:52:00,940
That happened.

1538
02:52:00,940 --> 02:52:02,219
I got three.

1539
02:52:02,219 --> 02:52:02,620
Come on.

1540
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:04,459
That actually happened.

1541
02:52:04,459 --> 02:52:05,420
He actually drove here.

1542
02:52:06,870 --> 02:52:10,790
Actually had an actual filter from the actual Beetlejuice

1543
02:52:10,790 --> 02:52:12,950
that actually showed up at my actual house.

1544
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:19,450
Recycled water.

1545
02:52:20,090 --> 02:52:26,899
What is this thing?

1546
02:52:26,899 --> 02:52:28,100
An actual Beetlejuice.

1547
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:35,340
Oh, is there a great wall?

1548
02:52:35,340 --> 02:52:36,059
What do you want me to do?

1549
02:52:41,159 --> 02:52:42,520
Should I go into locations?

1550
02:52:48,459 --> 02:52:50,219
One of the biggest stars known.

1551
02:52:52,569 --> 02:52:53,989
What is this one?

1552
02:52:53,989 --> 02:52:54,629
How big is it?

1553
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:58,500
How many pounds is that?

1554
02:53:02,139 --> 02:53:04,700
Type in fuck and see if it gets any results.

1555
02:53:11,379 --> 02:53:12,659
Why would they ever do that?

1556
02:53:15,559 --> 02:53:17,239
No scientist is going to make.

1557
02:53:18,459 --> 02:53:19,180
Fuck.

1558
02:53:19,180 --> 02:53:23,350
I don't believe that for a second.

1559
02:53:23,909 --> 02:53:26,180
No, of course not.

1560
02:53:31,270 --> 02:53:32,229
I don't want to type it in.

1561
02:53:45,700 --> 02:53:50,540
I'm turning the game off so you can't see what I type next.

1562
02:53:50,540 --> 02:54:04,500
No, none of those exist.

1563
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:23,979
None of these exist.

1564
02:54:28,139 --> 02:54:28,459
What is this thing?

1565
02:54:28,459 --> 02:54:29,739
This is the biggest object in the universe?

1566
02:54:30,299 --> 02:54:31,340
Something like that.

1567
02:54:31,340 --> 02:54:36,920
This is Starwo G64.

1568
02:54:37,930 --> 02:54:39,290
Go to the Pinwheel Galaxy.

1569
02:54:44,309 --> 02:54:45,110
Well, that was a...

1570
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:46,309
I think you lied to me.

1571
02:54:46,309 --> 02:54:46,870
Pinwheel?

1572
02:54:54,969 --> 02:54:56,489
The Sloan Wall.

1573
02:54:58,940 --> 02:54:59,659
There's nothing...

1574
02:54:59,659 --> 02:55:00,459
There's nothing showing up.

1575
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:01,579
This...

1576
02:55:01,579 --> 02:55:02,620
The wall?

1577
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:04,760
What would it be called?

1578
02:55:07,510 --> 02:55:08,069
M1...

1579
02:55:08,950 --> 02:55:10,629
M101?

1580
02:55:13,030 --> 02:55:14,229
This M29?

1581
02:55:15,579 --> 02:55:20,219
Who keeps track of this shit?

1582
02:55:20,219 --> 02:55:22,620
If to be like an astronaut scientist person,

1583
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:34,809
do you have to memorize all this shit?

1584
02:55:34,809 --> 02:55:37,590
Imagine needing to know all this.

1585
02:55:37,590 --> 02:55:39,110
So this is the biggest thing in the universe.

1586
02:55:40,010 --> 02:55:41,260
This here.

1587
02:55:41,260 --> 02:55:42,940
The M101.

1588
02:55:42,940 --> 02:55:46,170
It's called the computer.

1589
02:55:46,170 --> 02:55:49,879
Yeah, what about like 40 years ago?

1590
02:55:49,879 --> 02:55:51,079
30 to 40 years ago?

1591
02:55:51,079 --> 02:55:51,719
How did they keep track of...

1592
02:55:51,719 --> 02:55:53,239
They wrote it on notepads?

1593
02:55:53,799 --> 02:55:59,850
They had a book.

1594
02:55:59,850 --> 02:56:00,569
That's a big book.

1595
02:56:01,129 --> 02:56:07,030
They had computers.

1596
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:07,909
Not powerful enough.

1597
02:56:08,629 --> 02:56:10,950
They had like fucking 100k worth of data.

1598
02:56:10,950 --> 02:56:13,590
That's not enough to store 500 trillion stars.

1599
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:24,540
That's kind of cool looking.

1600
02:56:27,459 --> 02:56:28,739
Text is not heavy at all.

1601
02:56:29,299 --> 02:56:32,100
Yeah, but 500 trillion lines of text

1602
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:34,500
is more than a computer in the 70s can handle.

1603
02:56:36,299 --> 02:56:38,459
This is actually called the pinwheel galaxy.

1604
02:56:41,079 --> 02:56:42,760
Well, maybe I should die in there.

1605
02:56:47,930 --> 02:56:49,370
So many things in here though.

1606
02:56:49,370 --> 02:56:50,729
Let's just pick a random one.

1607
02:56:50,729 --> 02:56:55,290
It looks super giant.

1608
02:56:56,010 --> 02:57:04,659
Do I feel like the guy that names stars

1609
02:57:04,659 --> 02:57:06,100
is the same guy that's so sick

1610
02:57:06,100 --> 02:57:08,659
of naming different colors of crayons or paints?

1611
02:57:12,889 --> 02:57:16,489
Yeah, we just found another 500 planets over here, Bill.

1612
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:18,180
Shit.

1613
02:57:18,739 --> 02:57:25,559
Yeah, we really need names for them all.

1614
02:57:25,559 --> 02:57:30,409
That's cool though.

1615
02:57:30,409 --> 02:57:38,760
Where do we go?

1616
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:39,399
What was it called?

1617
02:57:39,399 --> 02:57:39,959
I...

1618
02:57:39,959 --> 02:57:41,500
I see what?

1619
02:57:41,500 --> 02:57:42,860
I see 1001?

1620
02:57:52,899 --> 02:57:53,459
This is it?

1621
02:57:58,440 --> 02:58:01,079
I wouldn't be surprised, man, if this was an eyeball.

1622
02:58:01,079 --> 02:58:03,219
This was an eye.

1623
02:58:03,780 --> 02:58:22,010
What even is existence, by the way?

1624
02:58:22,010 --> 02:58:23,209
What the fuck is existence?

1625
02:58:31,209 --> 02:58:32,569
101...

1626
02:58:32,569 --> 02:58:34,090
1101.

1627
02:58:34,090 --> 02:58:49,559
I just wanted to laugh.

1628
02:58:49,559 --> 02:58:50,520
So this is it.

1629
02:58:50,520 --> 02:59:03,370
It's like foggy over here.

1630
02:59:03,370 --> 02:59:05,690
I see 1101.

1631
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:14,629
Let's get in a little closer.

1632
02:59:14,629 --> 02:59:20,360
What's like right at the heart?

1633
02:59:20,360 --> 02:59:26,729
Is it weird that I think that if you get to the center of this,

1634
02:59:26,729 --> 02:59:28,250
you're gonna get superpowers.

1635
02:59:28,250 --> 02:59:33,000
That's how this works.

1636
02:59:33,079 --> 02:59:39,420
If you touch in the middle here, you turn into Superman.

1637
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:40,299
How would that be?

1638
02:59:40,299 --> 02:59:41,180
It would be...

1639
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:46,250
That's how that would work.

1640
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:49,370
All you need to do is just breathe into your nostrils, the air here,

1641
02:59:49,370 --> 02:59:51,719
and you'll get the power of invisibility.

1642
02:59:51,719 --> 02:59:58,899
This is huge.

1643
02:59:58,899 --> 03:00:01,379
Hold on, what just zoomed by?

1644
03:00:01,379 --> 03:00:06,700
Star.

1645
03:00:13,239 --> 03:00:14,120
Radiation.

1646
03:00:14,120 --> 03:00:17,879
Yeah, but what if it's not radiation?

1647
03:00:17,879 --> 03:00:19,239
What if it's something else that we don't know?

1648
03:00:19,799 --> 03:00:21,239
What if everyone's just like,

1649
03:00:21,239 --> 03:00:23,079
ah, there's radiation in there, you're dead.

1650
03:00:23,079 --> 03:00:23,639
What if it's not?

1651
03:00:23,639 --> 03:00:26,309
What if it's like radiation?

1652
03:00:26,309 --> 03:00:27,379
I don't know.

1653
03:00:27,379 --> 03:00:28,100
What if it's something else?

1654
03:00:28,100 --> 03:00:29,459
What if it's like the other...

1655
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:29,940
I don't know.

1656
03:00:30,739 --> 03:00:32,180
Nobody knows what's in here.

1657
03:00:32,180 --> 03:00:34,950
You don't know what the hell is in here.

1658
03:00:34,950 --> 03:00:36,149
Nobody knows what the fuck is in here.

1659
03:00:44,309 --> 03:00:44,709
What?

1660
03:00:44,709 --> 03:00:45,510
No, I'm serious.

1661
03:00:45,510 --> 03:00:48,229
Like, you don't know what's in the middle here.

1662
03:00:48,229 --> 03:01:00,299
Quick, say, Shmee.

1663
03:01:00,299 --> 03:01:09,540
I'm in the middle.

1664
03:01:09,540 --> 03:01:16,459
I'm in the center.

1665
03:01:16,459 --> 03:01:17,899
I have made it to the center.

1666
03:01:26,889 --> 03:01:27,850
I'm gonna try it.

1667
03:01:27,850 --> 03:01:36,340
Okay, here we go.

1668
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:37,860
Fuck, it was muted.

1669
03:01:37,860 --> 03:01:39,450
Why was it muted?

1670
03:01:39,450 --> 03:01:40,729
Why would you be muted?

1671
03:01:40,729 --> 03:01:41,530
Why does every...

1672
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:49,030
Why is YouTube permanently mute itself?

1673
03:01:49,030 --> 03:01:50,409
What feature is that?

1674
03:01:50,409 --> 03:01:56,940
What kind of dumb feature is that?

1675
03:01:56,940 --> 03:02:00,379
Hey, you know that website you just clicked on to want to watch a video?

1676
03:02:00,379 --> 03:02:07,219
We're gonna make sure it's muted when you click on it.

1677
03:02:07,219 --> 03:02:09,860
Why does YouTube always assume that I'm in like a dorm room

1678
03:02:09,860 --> 03:02:12,340
surrounded by like 10 people at like 4 o'clock in the morning

1679
03:02:12,340 --> 03:02:14,180
with speakers as loud as they can go?

1680
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:20,389
What?

1681
03:02:20,389 --> 03:02:23,829
YouTube, I promise I'm not like in a fucking nursery

1682
03:02:23,829 --> 03:02:25,829
with the volume at max

1683
03:02:25,829 --> 03:02:28,149
with like a new Bose speaker system.

1684
03:02:31,079 --> 03:02:32,840
Why does every video have to be muted?

1685
03:02:37,340 --> 03:02:38,540
It doesn't have to be like this.

1686
03:02:39,180 --> 03:02:43,420
Everything is either muted or at maximum volume.

1687
03:02:43,420 --> 03:02:44,780
Just what is...

1688
03:02:46,139 --> 03:02:46,620
Why?

1689
03:02:47,659 --> 03:02:52,739
Bose is garbage?

1690
03:02:52,739 --> 03:02:53,540
What?

1691
03:02:53,540 --> 03:03:00,180
What do you mean, Bose is garbage?

1692
03:03:00,180 --> 03:03:10,780
What do you mean it is?

1693
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:12,299
Where are you getting that information from?

1694
03:03:12,299 --> 03:03:20,579
Who told you that?

1695
03:03:20,579 --> 03:03:21,620
Holy shit, you guys.

1696
03:03:24,059 --> 03:03:28,299
You guys have strong opinions about Bose sound.

1697
03:03:28,860 --> 03:03:32,340
Whoa, where am I?

1698
03:03:32,340 --> 03:03:55,059
I made it.

1699
03:03:55,059 --> 03:03:57,510
I'm in the fucking center of all creation.

1700
03:03:57,510 --> 03:03:58,309
Let me try it.

1701
03:04:01,020 --> 03:04:01,979
I think that may have worked.

1702
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:05,350
Oh, hold on.

1703
03:04:05,350 --> 03:04:07,930
Come in.

1704
03:04:07,930 --> 03:04:08,329
Just wait.

1705
03:04:08,889 --> 03:04:09,850
Wait a second.

1706
03:04:33,989 --> 03:04:35,750
Yeah, I'm running up the stairs.

1707
03:04:35,750 --> 03:04:36,389
Hey.

1708
03:04:36,389 --> 03:04:46,100
Sorry, I had another package.

1709
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:49,100
I got a lot of deliveries.

1710
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:51,739
Me and Beetlejuice, I like this.

1711
03:04:51,739 --> 03:05:03,260
This is a joke.

1712
03:05:03,260 --> 03:05:07,909
I was thinking about going and getting a package

1713
03:05:07,909 --> 03:05:09,110
and bringing it up here

1714
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:13,260
because there's a package actually down there right now

1715
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:15,590
but it has like all information on it

1716
03:05:15,590 --> 03:05:17,350
and I couldn't like...

1717
03:05:17,350 --> 03:05:19,620
I couldn't do it.

1718
03:05:19,620 --> 03:05:22,420
I would have to like have ripped off all the labels and shit

1719
03:05:22,579 --> 03:05:23,139
couldn't do it.

1720
03:05:34,309 --> 03:05:36,870
He had to drive back for another package.

1721
03:05:42,219 --> 03:05:43,260
Okay, so where are we?

1722
03:05:43,819 --> 03:05:44,620
Oh, ding dong.

1723
03:05:44,620 --> 03:05:45,420
Oh, that's funny.

1724
03:05:45,420 --> 03:05:58,010
Here we go.

1725
03:05:58,010 --> 03:05:58,969
iCar.

1726
03:05:58,969 --> 03:06:01,530
Wasn't I supposed to leave

1727
03:06:01,530 --> 03:06:03,500
till I go to the bathroom and come back

1728
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:04,219
and do something else?

1729
03:06:10,340 --> 03:06:11,780
iCarly.

1730
03:06:12,579 --> 03:06:13,860
This is not an iCarly.

1731
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:14,260
Wait, i...

1732
03:06:15,139 --> 03:06:22,729
Wait, hold on.

1733
03:06:22,729 --> 03:06:23,690
One, one, one.

1734
03:06:23,690 --> 03:06:25,850
There's a black hole in here.

1735
03:06:31,639 --> 03:06:32,360
So, shit.

1736
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,159
Control G will take me to...

1737
03:06:35,959 --> 03:06:39,719
What's the name of the...

1738
03:06:41,770 --> 03:06:42,809
Okay, so I did Control G.

1739
03:06:47,399 --> 03:06:49,159
Go find Drake and Josh.

1740
03:06:49,159 --> 03:06:57,420
So I'm back in here.

1741
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:59,799
But so, so what?

1742
03:06:59,799 --> 03:07:08,040
Am I inside of the damn thing?

1743
03:07:08,040 --> 03:07:08,520
Zoom out.

1744
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:10,299
I'm trying to zoom out.

1745
03:07:10,299 --> 03:07:11,340
Holy shit.

1746
03:07:12,729 --> 03:07:15,479
Whoa, this is insanity.

1747
03:07:15,479 --> 03:07:16,360
That's awesome.

1748
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:18,899
That's awesome.

1749
03:07:18,899 --> 03:07:19,540
Holy shit.

1750
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:38,629
I gotta get a good pic of this one right here.

1751
03:07:38,629 --> 03:07:39,750
That's insane.

1752
03:07:39,750 --> 03:07:46,149
Remember all of this existed.

1753
03:07:47,020 --> 03:07:48,620
Yeah, that's wild.

1754
03:07:48,620 --> 03:07:49,430
That's what I'm saying.

1755
03:07:49,430 --> 03:07:50,709
Like how the fuck does this exist?

1756
03:07:57,459 --> 03:07:58,739
What the hell even is light?

1757
03:07:59,750 --> 03:08:01,030
Where does it come from?

1758
03:08:01,030 --> 03:08:10,520
You understand what I'm saying?

1759
03:08:10,520 --> 03:08:16,120
Where the hell does light even come from?

1760
03:08:17,620 --> 03:08:18,260
Photons.

1761
03:08:18,260 --> 03:08:20,260
What the fuck is a photon?

1762
03:08:20,260 --> 03:08:32,360
Like, I know it's energy,

1763
03:08:32,360 --> 03:08:34,120
but what even is energy?

1764
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:37,639
What does that even mean?

1765
03:08:37,639 --> 03:08:39,399
Right now somebody's laughing at us.

1766
03:08:39,399 --> 03:08:41,000
Somebody's laughing at us right now.

1767
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:42,579
Somebody has this on a computer screen,

1768
03:08:42,579 --> 03:08:47,209
like up fucking seven trillion light years away somewhere.

1769
03:08:47,209 --> 03:08:49,450
They're like, oh my god, they're laughing.

1770
03:08:49,450 --> 03:08:51,209
They're trying to figure out what light is over there

1771
03:08:51,209 --> 03:08:53,290
on that stupid shitty stream.

1772
03:08:53,290 --> 03:08:54,969
That guy's such a boomer.

1773
03:08:54,969 --> 03:08:59,049
Like they even use that terminology too.

1774
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:09,299
I want to get a better picture right there.

1775
03:09:09,299 --> 03:09:12,629
It's going to hurt, but it's all right.

1776
03:09:12,629 --> 03:09:13,510
Drop this a little bit.

1777
03:09:14,149 --> 03:09:21,139
I'm going in.

1778
03:09:21,139 --> 03:09:26,440
I'm going in.

1779
03:09:26,440 --> 03:09:38,680
Why am I going backwards?

1780
03:09:38,680 --> 03:09:42,250
I'm going backwards.

1781
03:09:42,250 --> 03:09:43,209
Am I going backwards?

1782
03:10:32,709 --> 03:10:33,829
What the fuck is that?

1783
03:10:35,430 --> 03:10:40,010
Turn up the brightness.

1784
03:10:40,010 --> 03:10:44,739
Oh shit, I know how this movie ends.

1785
03:10:44,739 --> 03:10:46,020
For the rest of my existence,

1786
03:10:46,020 --> 03:10:51,030
I climb out of TVs and fucking call people,

1787
03:10:51,030 --> 03:10:52,629
collect from the bottom of the well.

1788
03:10:52,629 --> 03:11:05,049
How do I get out of here?

1789
03:11:05,049 --> 03:11:06,010
Head towards the light.

1790
03:11:06,010 --> 03:11:09,559
The light doesn't exist anymore.

1791
03:11:09,559 --> 03:11:10,680
What even is light?

1792
03:11:10,680 --> 03:11:14,250
What is, there's something else here.

1793
03:11:14,250 --> 03:11:19,899
I'm going.

1794
03:11:19,899 --> 03:11:23,059
I'm going.

1795
03:11:23,059 --> 03:11:47,059
I'm going.

1796
03:11:47,059 --> 03:11:48,360
Quick.

1797
03:11:48,360 --> 03:11:50,200
Someday somebody will develop these.

1798
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:09,559
Did I make it out?

1799
03:12:09,559 --> 03:12:12,340
I made it out.

1800
03:12:12,340 --> 03:12:13,299
So what's on the other side?

1801
03:12:13,299 --> 03:12:13,860
Go again.

1802
03:12:13,860 --> 03:12:21,479
There's a Windows update error here.

1803
03:12:21,479 --> 03:12:22,440
Okay, hold on.

1804
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:22,920
Black hole.

1805
03:12:22,920 --> 03:12:30,780
Go in.

1806
03:12:30,780 --> 03:12:31,420
Do it again.

1807
03:12:31,420 --> 03:12:33,719
Let's get the fuck in there.

1808
03:12:33,719 --> 03:12:37,299
Turn off the, turn that off.

1809
03:12:37,299 --> 03:12:40,250
And then I want to make this fast.

1810
03:12:43,479 --> 03:12:44,920
Oh fuck, I'm reversing time.

1811
03:12:44,920 --> 03:12:45,719
I just went through it.

1812
03:12:46,459 --> 03:12:46,860
All right.

1813
03:12:46,860 --> 03:12:48,459
I'm now in, I'm in no man's land now.

1814
03:12:48,459 --> 03:12:49,739
Now, this is important.

1815
03:12:49,739 --> 03:12:50,379
This is important.

1816
03:12:50,379 --> 03:12:50,940
I'm going to go down.

1817
03:12:51,579 --> 03:12:56,440
I want to go turn up the brightness.

1818
03:12:57,239 --> 03:12:57,879
Turn up the magnitude.

1819
03:12:57,879 --> 03:12:58,920
We're going to find out what's down here.

1820
03:13:01,750 --> 03:13:02,069
Okay.

1821
03:13:02,069 --> 03:13:16,340
I'm looking down and I'm going to go 500 trillion light years away until we hit.

1822
03:13:16,340 --> 03:13:17,459
What the fuck was that?

1823
03:13:18,100 --> 03:13:57,799
Wait, that's right.

1824
03:13:57,799 --> 03:14:02,700
Time doesn't exist in here.

1825
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:04,379
I forgot about that.

1826
03:14:05,819 --> 03:14:07,100
There is no time.

1827
03:14:07,100 --> 03:14:09,639
There is only now.

1828
03:14:09,639 --> 03:14:25,690
I'm very comfortable right now.

1829
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:40,760
Whoa.

1830
03:14:42,469 --> 03:14:42,969
Wow.

1831
03:14:45,500 --> 03:14:47,500
Literally fucking nothing could change.

1832
03:14:48,969 --> 03:14:51,399
My attention right now.

1833
03:14:51,399 --> 03:14:51,959
Holy shit.

1834
03:14:51,959 --> 03:14:53,079
This is fucking incredible.

1835
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:59,000
Actually fucking one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.

1836
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:03,299
I'm all right right now.

1837
03:15:03,299 --> 03:15:04,100
I don't need anything else.

1838
03:15:04,979 --> 03:15:05,620
Nothing else.

1839
03:15:07,459 --> 03:15:08,100
Oh, hold on.

1840
03:15:12,739 --> 03:15:14,260
Sometimes you got to go get a package.

1841
03:15:17,780 --> 03:15:18,100
Fuck it.

1842
03:15:18,100 --> 03:15:19,219
They'll leave it at the door.

1843
03:15:19,219 --> 03:15:21,159
Wait, wait, wait.

1844
03:15:21,159 --> 03:15:22,360
I need this right there.

1845
03:15:22,360 --> 03:15:22,840
No, no, no.

1846
03:15:22,840 --> 03:15:23,479
Do it again.

1847
03:15:23,479 --> 03:15:29,590
I want to get that again right when they, right here.

1848
03:15:29,590 --> 03:15:30,149
Ready?

1849
03:15:30,149 --> 03:15:33,719
Did I get it?

1850
03:15:33,719 --> 03:15:39,500
Need to sign for it?

1851
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:41,659
No, they'll just like, they'll whip it as hard as they can at the front door.

1852
03:15:46,700 --> 03:16:06,280
Oh, I made it through.

1853
03:16:06,280 --> 03:16:06,680
I think.

1854
03:16:10,040 --> 03:16:10,360
Stop.

1855
03:16:10,360 --> 03:16:11,799
I just want to take a fucking picture.

1856
03:16:12,520 --> 03:16:16,709
Wait, wait, wait.

1857
03:16:16,709 --> 03:16:17,750
What was that?

1858
03:16:17,750 --> 03:16:23,209
No one's going to get one of these.

1859
03:16:23,209 --> 03:16:23,770
No one's going to get one.

1860
03:16:23,770 --> 03:16:24,409
I did.

1861
03:16:24,409 --> 03:16:44,340
It's the Borg.

1862
03:16:45,219 --> 03:16:51,430
Come on.

1863
03:16:51,430 --> 03:16:52,149
Let me get this.

1864
03:16:55,690 --> 03:16:56,329
No, no, no.

1865
03:16:56,329 --> 03:16:57,209
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1866
03:16:57,209 --> 03:16:58,170
Right here.

1867
03:16:58,170 --> 03:17:18,809
It's a toilet.

1868
03:17:24,409 --> 03:17:24,889
Wow.

1869
03:17:24,889 --> 03:17:27,129
What a wonderful, beautiful black hole.

1870
03:17:27,770 --> 03:17:49,940
Really cool stuff.

1871
03:17:50,579 --> 03:17:54,520
I wonder what this actually is.

1872
03:17:55,159 --> 03:17:58,280
There's so much science as to what the heck is this even?

1873
03:17:58,280 --> 03:17:59,159
Is it energy?

1874
03:17:59,159 --> 03:18:00,440
Is it a time paradox?

1875
03:18:01,299 --> 03:18:02,579
Is it aliens?

1876
03:18:02,579 --> 03:18:03,700
Did aliens make this?

1877
03:18:03,700 --> 03:18:04,260
I don't know.

1878
03:18:04,260 --> 03:18:05,780
It's so many questions that I have.

1879
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:08,219
We'll never know the answers to.

1880
03:18:14,620 --> 03:18:39,190
Now I'm stuck down here.

1881
03:18:42,040 --> 03:18:42,360
Great.

1882
03:18:45,350 --> 03:18:47,590
I've got to, I'm stuck down here.

1883
03:18:47,590 --> 03:18:48,389
Can anybody help me?

1884
03:18:48,389 --> 03:18:49,430
Is there anybody that can help me?

1885
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:50,950
Oh, hold on.

1886
03:18:52,309 --> 03:18:52,790
Somebody.

1887
03:18:56,069 --> 03:18:57,590
Somebody got to somebody's bearing a plumber.

1888
03:19:12,260 --> 03:19:12,899
No, almost.

1889
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:15,049
You got to do more than that.

1890
03:19:16,379 --> 03:19:17,020
A little more.

1891
03:19:18,459 --> 03:19:19,899
We're still stuck down here, man.

1892
03:19:23,319 --> 03:19:23,799
Help us.

1893
03:19:24,700 --> 03:19:32,649
Preview, preview, preview, preview.

1894
03:19:39,500 --> 03:19:40,860
That wasn't even a plunger.

1895
03:19:40,860 --> 03:19:41,979
What the fuck was that?

1896
03:19:42,700 --> 03:19:44,379
We're still stuck down here and we need help.

1897
03:19:44,700 --> 03:19:47,260
What do you recommend is the quickest and easiest way

1898
03:19:47,260 --> 03:19:48,299
to unclog a drain?

1899
03:19:50,219 --> 03:19:50,700
I don't know.

1900
03:19:50,700 --> 03:19:51,579
If your sink is clogged like this,

1901
03:19:51,579 --> 03:19:53,260
you're definitely looking for the quickest

1902
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:55,579
and easiest way to get it unclogged

1903
03:19:55,579 --> 03:19:57,979
and the over-the-counter drain cleaners work most

1904
03:19:57,979 --> 03:20:00,059
of the time, but they can be a little damaging

1905
03:20:00,059 --> 03:20:01,020
to your pipes.

1906
03:20:01,020 --> 03:20:02,219
Before you try that.

1907
03:20:02,219 --> 03:20:02,860
Yeah.

1908
03:20:02,860 --> 03:20:05,979
This is a drain snake and it has a brush

1909
03:20:05,979 --> 03:20:07,819
or sometimes several hooks on the end.

1910
03:20:07,819 --> 03:20:08,379
Well, be careful.

1911
03:20:08,379 --> 03:20:08,940
We're down here.

1912
03:20:08,940 --> 03:20:10,620
To reach down and grab.

1913
03:20:10,620 --> 03:20:11,340
Easy, easy.

1914
03:20:11,340 --> 03:20:14,459
To be clogging up your sink, particularly in a bathroom.

1915
03:20:14,459 --> 03:20:16,379
But if you have a lot of grease and food,

1916
03:20:16,379 --> 03:20:17,899
you need a little pressure

1917
03:20:17,899 --> 03:20:20,540
and everybody has one of these very, very effective.

1918
03:20:20,540 --> 03:20:20,860
What is it?

1919
03:20:20,860 --> 03:20:21,899
Oh, is that a plunger?

1920
03:20:21,899 --> 03:20:22,540
I can't see.

1921
03:20:22,540 --> 03:20:24,219
But if you have a double sink like this,

1922
03:20:24,219 --> 03:20:26,139
you want to make sure you take your stopper

1923
03:20:26,139 --> 03:20:28,459
on the open side of the sink.

1924
03:20:28,459 --> 03:20:28,780
Where is he?

1925
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:30,299
He's coming this way.

1926
03:20:30,299 --> 03:20:33,340
That'll put more pressure on the side of the plunger

1927
03:20:33,340 --> 03:20:34,940
and then that'll be very successful

1928
03:20:34,940 --> 03:20:35,899
in blowing through.

1929
03:20:35,899 --> 03:20:36,940
That wasn't enough.

1930
03:20:36,940 --> 03:20:37,659
That wasn't enough.

1931
03:20:37,659 --> 03:20:38,620
Follow that up.

1932
03:20:38,620 --> 03:20:39,739
Plenty of hot water.

1933
03:20:39,739 --> 03:20:40,540
Sorry, Dave.

1934
03:20:40,540 --> 03:20:41,180
That wasn't enough.

1935
03:20:43,750 --> 03:20:44,389
God damn it.

1936
03:20:45,350 --> 03:20:47,139
You're going to need something more powerful than that.

1937
03:20:52,870 --> 03:21:03,260
Come on, almost there.

1938
03:21:12,260 --> 03:21:12,899
You got it.

1939
03:21:12,899 --> 03:21:13,219
Thanks.

1940
03:21:13,940 --> 03:21:15,989
All it took is a vacuum to stuff it down the drain.

1941
03:21:15,989 --> 03:21:17,430
By the way, if you ever have a drain,

1942
03:21:17,430 --> 03:21:18,790
if you have a clogged toilet or something,

1943
03:21:20,379 --> 03:21:21,899
just get the vacuum attachment.

1944
03:21:22,780 --> 03:21:24,379
Stuff it down into the toilet bowl,

1945
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:25,659
into the drain,

1946
03:21:25,659 --> 03:21:27,739
turn it on and suck up whatever it is in the vacuum.

1947
03:21:33,299 --> 03:21:36,260
Now, one of you psychos is going to do that

1948
03:21:36,260 --> 03:21:37,860
and I have to make sure I say

1949
03:21:37,860 --> 03:21:38,899
that that is not a joke.

1950
03:21:38,899 --> 03:21:39,700
I hope you do that

1951
03:21:41,399 --> 03:21:42,120
because it works.

1952
03:21:48,409 --> 03:21:49,610
Do not do that.

1953
03:21:50,819 --> 03:21:52,659
I'm not going to be responsible

1954
03:21:52,659 --> 03:21:54,979
for your fucking YouTube prank video

1955
03:21:54,979 --> 03:21:56,659
that you put up online and say,

1956
03:21:56,659 --> 03:21:58,659
hey, Jeremy said this.

1957
03:21:58,659 --> 03:22:11,659
This is so crazy.

1958
03:22:12,219 --> 03:22:15,559
All right.

1959
03:22:15,559 --> 03:22:17,479
I think we saw all we need to see in this game.

1960
03:22:17,479 --> 03:22:18,120
Is there anything else?

1961
03:22:23,479 --> 03:22:29,239
Any other cool, any cool other nucleuses?

1962
03:22:31,500 --> 03:22:32,860
Zoom out all the way.

1963
03:22:32,860 --> 03:22:34,059
Oh, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.

1964
03:22:34,059 --> 03:22:34,620
I was going to do that.

1965
03:22:34,620 --> 03:22:35,500
I was going to run away.

1966
03:22:37,379 --> 03:22:37,860
Where am I?

1967
03:22:43,639 --> 03:22:44,120
There we go.

1968
03:22:44,120 --> 03:22:48,229
Okay, let's turn down the magnitude here.

1969
03:22:48,229 --> 03:22:49,909
It's a little much for me.

1970
03:22:50,790 --> 03:22:57,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1971
03:22:57,639 --> 03:22:59,479
Put black hole quality on low.

1972
03:22:59,479 --> 03:23:00,760
Put black hole quality on low.

1973
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:01,799
Black hole quality on low.

1974
03:23:01,799 --> 03:23:02,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1975
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:04,840
Wait, wait, wait, where, where, where?

1976
03:23:04,840 --> 03:23:07,139
G, control G.

1977
03:23:08,409 --> 03:23:09,049
What was it called?

1978
03:23:11,770 --> 03:23:12,649
What was it?

1979
03:23:12,649 --> 03:23:17,959
Black hole quality on low.

1980
03:23:17,959 --> 03:23:19,639
Look up IC dash.

1981
03:23:19,639 --> 03:23:20,040
Shut up.

1982
03:23:29,909 --> 03:23:30,629
All right, hold on.

1983
03:23:30,629 --> 03:23:31,350
I'm going to go pee.

1984
03:23:32,149 --> 03:23:36,180
I'll be right back.

1985
03:23:36,180 --> 03:23:36,739
I'm going to pee.

1986
03:27:01,909 --> 03:27:02,950
Are you guys fucking kidding me?

1987
03:27:04,229 --> 03:27:04,549
Really?

1988
03:27:05,750 --> 03:27:06,069
Really?

1989
03:27:07,510 --> 03:27:08,309
All right, nice.

1990
03:27:12,149 --> 03:27:15,430
I come back and people are just putting minuses into the chat.

1991
03:27:16,149 --> 03:27:34,809
Is this tug of war or is this a barometer for how the jokes are?

1992
03:27:34,809 --> 03:27:35,850
It's because I left.

1993
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:37,719
I'm coming back.

1994
03:27:39,579 --> 03:27:42,459
All right, what do you guys want me to turn on?

1995
03:27:42,459 --> 03:27:47,030
A quality low, right?

1996
03:27:47,590 --> 03:27:51,420
A black hole quality on low.

1997
03:27:52,139 --> 03:27:54,200
Why is it two mediums?

1998
03:27:54,200 --> 03:27:54,920
Oh, never mind.

1999
03:27:55,479 --> 03:27:58,680
Black hole quality on low and then go to a black hole.

2000
03:27:59,399 --> 03:28:00,020
All right.

2001
03:28:00,579 --> 03:28:03,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

2002
03:28:03,020 --> 03:28:03,899
Yeah, I changed it.

2003
03:28:03,899 --> 03:28:04,540
I know.

2004
03:28:04,540 --> 03:28:05,100
Come on.

2005
03:28:05,100 --> 03:28:08,459
I live in one part of the earth that cares about this and this.

2006
03:28:09,260 --> 03:28:15,100
All right, so where's the black hole?

2007
03:28:16,569 --> 03:28:18,250
What's a cool black hole that you know of?

2008
03:28:18,809 --> 03:28:23,559
Because after this, we're going to move on to something else.

2009
03:28:28,680 --> 03:28:30,360
Go inside a black hole.

2010
03:28:35,219 --> 03:28:36,420
For a second, I really almost

2011
03:28:38,389 --> 03:28:39,350
like typed that in.

2012
03:28:41,239 --> 03:28:42,520
Not because somebody just wrote it.

2013
03:28:42,520 --> 03:28:43,959
I was like, oh, wait, no, that's a song.

2014
03:28:49,850 --> 03:28:50,489
Which one of these?

2015
03:28:53,829 --> 03:28:54,309
X1.

2016
03:28:59,350 --> 03:29:01,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2017
03:29:01,110 --> 03:29:02,149
What what's going on here?

2018
03:29:02,149 --> 03:29:02,549
Why is this?

2019
03:29:05,909 --> 03:29:06,549
Why is it on?

2020
03:29:07,770 --> 03:29:08,649
Okay, all right.

2021
03:29:08,649 --> 03:29:08,969
This is...

2022
03:29:09,770 --> 03:29:27,459
Why did that happen?

2023
03:29:27,459 --> 03:29:32,379
Oh, this thing has like flames on it.

2024
03:29:49,670 --> 03:29:50,950
Is this a black hole?

2025
03:29:50,950 --> 03:29:53,530
This is not a black hole though.

2026
03:29:53,530 --> 03:29:55,049
I'm looking for a black hole.

2027
03:29:55,049 --> 03:30:12,379
Right, is the other one is a black hole.

2028
03:30:12,379 --> 03:30:13,340
This is a black hole.

2029
03:30:14,459 --> 03:30:18,809
Don't look like a black hole

2030
03:30:18,930 --> 03:30:25,530
Hold on slow down slow down. What are you thinking here times 30?

2031
03:30:26,209 --> 03:30:36,680
Slow down the speed. Let's get a closer look here. It looks like a butane torch

2032
03:30:37,260 --> 03:30:47,969
All right. Why do I feel like this is going like a million miles per hour? This is a regular speed

2033
03:30:48,670 --> 03:31:49,620
Slow down. I mean I where do you well abstract now do normal speed

2034
03:31:49,620 --> 03:31:59,170
I'm gonna warn you this is probably gonna hurt. This is not gonna be pretty to look at here

2035
03:31:59,250 --> 03:32:03,370
Just be aware of this despite this this could be a little over stimulating

2036
03:32:03,370 --> 03:32:06,489
Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that because this is gonna be a time is one speed

2037
03:32:07,010 --> 03:32:09,340
Yeah, just be this is gonna be super stimulating

2038
03:32:09,819 --> 03:33:18,559
Shit, what did I what the fuck? I'm trying to just go in backwards, but it's hard to line up. I slow down slow down

2039
03:33:19,120 --> 03:33:52,049
That's it. I get I'm zoomed out as far as I can in theory. You would see the back of your head

2040
03:33:52,229 --> 03:34:17,760
Let's go the other way. What happens if you go the other way in a black hole? No wrong same thing

2041
03:34:17,760 --> 03:34:31,799
Yeah, same thing happens. Well, that was cool. You get out. Do you though you're dead by the radiation?

2042
03:34:31,799 --> 03:34:35,659
We don't know this radiation there 3c 58

2043
03:34:37,979 --> 03:34:44,819
I just took I just took like an actual screenshot. I think 3c

2044
03:34:45,870 --> 03:34:51,379
58 3c

2045
03:34:51,420 --> 03:35:15,100
66 B. Let's see what this one's like. Yeah, it's a run-of-the-mill galaxy. No, yeah

2046
03:35:23,049 --> 03:35:34,739
FoV down. I mean, this is like the normal fov the bubble nebula now

2047
03:35:34,940 --> 03:35:58,379
Hold on. We'll do something else. Just relax. Just relax. I see why. Yep. Okay, do Sagittarius a didn't we already do?

2048
03:35:58,379 --> 03:36:09,530
Sagittarius a yeah, we already did Sagittarius a I was here before I mean we didn't see the ion cannon that was coming

2049
03:36:09,530 --> 03:36:28,940
Out of it. I don't think it wasn't this pronounced was it this is insane

2050
03:36:29,420 --> 03:36:45,979
Do a time-lapse doesn't have an orb. What is this an orbit of now you get tangled in that

2051
03:36:46,219 --> 03:36:52,350
You'd get tangled up in there. Oh, that's cuz of the black hole. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait

2052
03:36:52,629 --> 03:37:16,559
Wow, that's so cool. They all just ran the fuck into each other. What is the trajectory of this?

2053
03:37:16,559 --> 03:37:20,719
I want to see what is that trajectory? What's going up there?

2054
03:37:21,120 --> 03:37:32,790
What's that and why is that doing that if there's a black hole down here and it's all the gravity is getting like

2055
03:37:33,430 --> 03:37:38,229
What's this guy flying around for?

2056
03:37:43,709 --> 03:37:52,049
S111 that's so strange. What that's such a weird pattern

2057
03:37:52,409 --> 03:38:02,760
It goes up here and then just rides the rollercoaster down and does the same thing again. No, no, no, wait

2058
03:38:02,760 --> 03:38:08,180
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait, come back. Come back. Come back. Wait. Wait, what it's what come back come back

2059
03:38:08,399 --> 03:38:25,370
We reversed it just don't give a fuck come back here. What year is it?

2060
03:38:27,829 --> 03:38:57,370
8400 the year 8400 where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where the fuck did it go? I did okay

2061
03:38:57,370 --> 03:39:12,219
I did this stick this it disappeared on me. Let's go. Take a look. Oh, this is like

2062
03:39:12,739 --> 03:39:14,620
600

2063
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:16,540
Quatrillion light years away

2064
03:39:16,540 --> 03:39:37,639
Really what I'm on it, right G. Yeah G double G tap G go to object G

2065
03:39:37,639 --> 03:39:48,420
I'm I press G like five times. Are you like I'm not pressing G. They're like won't let me go over here

2066
03:39:48,920 --> 03:39:59,659
This is freaking me out. Hold on. See I can't go any faster. I have to like go there

2067
03:40:00,299 --> 03:40:12,780
What is happening? Yeah, look at this. It won't let me go over here

2068
03:40:12,979 --> 03:40:19,000
It stops me right here and spins me around. All right, I'm gonna have it come backwards then

2069
03:40:19,440 --> 03:40:31,229
Did we find a new planet? I think we found a new planet. I know nobody knows about this only we do reverse time

2070
03:40:31,750 --> 03:41:06,350
Pull it back. What I want to go to s1 1 1 1 is that the

2071
03:41:06,870 --> 03:41:18,709
Let me move out of the way. I think they might be broken. It might be broken. Yeah, I might come on

2072
03:41:18,790 --> 03:41:25,459
Is that it? I'm so confused right now. What is this line?

2073
03:41:26,020 --> 03:41:47,760
The line is even bending. I'm just gonna get right in the way. Okay, so

2074
03:41:48,280 --> 03:42:19,989
Let's go. Where is it? Get over here. Is it the black hole is fucking it up. The hell is this doing?

2075
03:42:20,430 --> 03:42:46,510
Well, oh well, I tried it's insane. Oh

2076
03:42:52,379 --> 03:43:07,840
Come on make a milkshake. It's pulling me back. Stop pulling me back. Just center G

2077
03:43:08,239 --> 03:43:34,549
It's going so fast that they all froze. All right, normal normal. It's time

2078
03:43:35,350 --> 03:44:00,020
You guys ready? I'm going this way for 10 straight seconds. Go to ID 10 T for black hole

2079
03:44:00,420 --> 03:44:24,969
Did you just spell out idiot? I think you did. Yeah, you did. That's idiot. That's that's pretty good

2080
03:44:25,090 --> 03:44:31,879
I'll give you that one. That was pretty good. All right, you ready? So we are distance 12

2081
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:39,639
The gala the universe cannot be infinite. There's definitely like a brick wall that you walk into there has to be an end

2082
03:44:40,159 --> 03:44:54,540
Nothing is infinite. There's an end. I made it. I did I'm here. I made it

2083
03:44:55,559 --> 03:44:59,090
I told you I told you there's gonna be like a fucking wall here. That's the end

2084
03:44:59,290 --> 03:45:25,110
But what does it look like from far away all the way back? I'm gonna laugh my ass off if it's a gnome

2085
03:45:39,010 --> 03:45:40,590
31

2086
03:45:40,590 --> 03:45:49,620
Gly now we're in darkness. Wait one here. What is that?

2087
03:45:49,979 --> 03:45:59,159
Let's find the I need the one red dot here and then I'm gonna move on. This is galaxy RG

2088
03:45:59,440 --> 03:46:01,440
wall 0 1 6

2089
03:46:01,840 --> 03:46:03,840
1 8 8

2090
03:46:04,360 --> 03:46:11,170
8 up the magnitude. I mean I'm at I'm at like almost a magnitude limit

2091
03:46:11,729 --> 03:46:26,530
No, I'm not how far can this go? I mean am I gonna try to break the computer?

2092
03:46:26,930 --> 03:46:33,479
Let's pull back and see what it is

2093
03:46:33,479 --> 03:46:42,690
What's the image? Come on my computer hurts

2094
03:46:43,129 --> 03:47:04,770
Pull it back and have it say something like the treasure's buried at this precise location. So that's what it looks like

2095
03:47:08,420 --> 03:47:15,139
This is this is somebody with like a sunburn. We're just a goddamn skin cell all of us

2096
03:47:15,540 --> 03:48:05,680
Pull it down pull it down pull it down pull it universe Sandbox universe. I'll do universe Sandbox

2097
03:48:05,680 --> 03:48:10,649
All right, let's play a fun game

2098
03:48:10,649 --> 03:48:17,090
So let's spin it around and wherever I land with my face and my finger is where I'm gonna go on vacation

2099
03:48:17,770 --> 03:48:20,610
Let's see. Oh my god. I hope it's Hawaii

2100
03:48:25,180 --> 03:48:32,069
I just choked on my water. What the fuck?

2101
03:48:42,440 --> 03:49:01,569
There it is it's this galaxy double G Oh

2102
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:03,729
Oh

2103
03:49:03,729 --> 03:49:13,290
Shit the the limit. I just blew a firework up in my face

2104
03:49:13,469 --> 03:49:27,950
What a great disposable camera picture by the way got the firework exploding again. It's over. Yeah, that's it

2105
03:49:27,950 --> 03:49:43,940
We got we got the wheel of death space engine has stopped responding close the program. Okay, that was interesting

2106
03:49:44,819 --> 03:49:49,020
Imagine being a science teacher and unloading that up during class

2107
03:49:49,420 --> 03:49:58,399
We didn't get that shit. The guy had a chalkboard and drew

2108
03:49:58,879 --> 03:50:07,450
Shitty planets in this like crusty white paste and his handwriting sucked

2109
03:50:09,729 --> 03:50:22,379
Imagine we had that shit god. That would have been awesome. I would have been so much more into school

2110
03:50:22,819 --> 03:50:34,350
Think about how much more fun and cool school would have been. I was so disinterested in high school

2111
03:50:43,899 --> 03:50:48,540
All right, so we have like

2112
03:50:49,780 --> 03:50:52,209
a couple hours hour or two I

2113
03:50:52,530 --> 03:50:59,469
Bought and I have downloaded. There's a couple of things that I thought would be might be fun. I have received various

2114
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:08,629
Recommendations and we're gonna do a poll. We'll do a poll on the screen here in a minute

2115
03:51:08,629 --> 03:51:15,540
I don't know I know about one of these but I do not know about the other one

2116
03:51:15,780 --> 03:51:19,340
So I'm gonna mispronounce this

2117
03:51:20,139 --> 03:51:27,670
Very very poorly because I don't know how to pronounce. I don't it's this one is called

2118
03:51:28,629 --> 03:51:37,979
Recetteer and item shops tail and the other one is cook serve delicious of the two that were

2119
03:51:38,420 --> 03:51:44,360
Requested that I thought might have been interesting. I also have cook serve delicious, too

2120
03:51:44,620 --> 03:51:54,700
Now I don't know there might be some internal debates here by the chatters

2121
03:51:55,319 --> 03:52:09,719
Both are so good. I have played cook serve delicious before I don't know if I should just open cook serve delicious, too

2122
03:52:10,079 --> 03:52:23,500
Is this a scenario where cook serve delicious to is just a better version of cook serve delicious one do it

2123
03:52:23,700 --> 03:52:31,379
We'll do do what cook serve delicious to is worse

2124
03:52:31,840 --> 03:52:37,719
Well, I'll put a poll on the screen here because we'll vote on that too. So straw poll

2125
03:52:38,479 --> 03:52:43,450
So let me give you an indicator of what's going on over the next few weeks. I

2126
03:52:44,950 --> 03:52:51,110
Want to do so obviously tomorrow. I'm probably gonna do Mario maker 2 tomorrow and just played random levels and

2127
03:52:51,590 --> 03:52:56,340
Fuck around for like, you know a few hours, however long I can take it

2128
03:52:57,340 --> 03:53:03,420
Saturday is the grain screen movie night on core stream and then on top of that

2129
03:53:04,200 --> 03:53:09,170
Next week. I want to I think I want to do Dark Souls randomizer

2130
03:53:09,690 --> 03:53:12,629
At least try that once or twice

2131
03:53:13,049 --> 03:53:16,969
randomized items randomized enemies and stuff looked like it was

2132
03:53:17,969 --> 03:53:19,969
Just I can't say words

2133
03:53:20,370 --> 03:53:22,370
but

2134
03:53:22,530 --> 03:53:31,049
Yeah, I can oh, huh. All right, hold on

2135
03:53:31,610 --> 03:53:34,690
I'm gonna just write on a bucket of an item shops tail

2136
03:53:35,290 --> 03:53:39,620
Is an item shops tail like its own stream?

2137
03:53:40,100 --> 03:53:46,770
Cuz I can kind of just play cook serve delicious for like a couple hours and we can just chill and talk about stuff

2138
03:53:46,770 --> 03:53:48,770
Cuz I didn't want to also bring up

2139
03:53:48,770 --> 03:53:50,770
we're kind of just

2140
03:53:50,969 --> 03:53:53,049
rolling here, so I didn't want to bring up the

2141
03:53:54,219 --> 03:53:58,139
Cuz at least two options are needed. There are two options. Oh

2142
03:53:58,780 --> 03:54:10,750
Okay, so the first option the cook serve delicious

2143
03:54:11,229 --> 03:54:19,139
That's just if you want to see that rather than an item shop still we will pick the first of the second one

2144
03:54:19,139 --> 03:54:23,379
I might even just open the first one. You know what I mean vote on that

2145
03:54:23,379 --> 03:54:26,540
I'm gonna put the BRB screen up and drop in a shitload of frames to

2146
03:54:28,920 --> 03:54:32,629
I don't know why this shit was fixed

2147
03:54:33,110 --> 03:54:34,870
But apparently not

2148
03:54:34,870 --> 03:54:39,229
Hopefully this is kind of like an outlier today because that's a lot of drop frames. I

2149
03:54:39,790 --> 03:54:53,379
Don't have time for reciter. It's its own stream. Is that true?

2150
03:54:54,139 --> 03:54:56,139
it's not just like a little

2151
03:54:56,899 --> 03:54:58,899
cook serve delicious is

2152
03:54:58,979 --> 03:55:19,180
More inclined to what we're doing right now. Does it really take that long? Huh? It's gigantic. Oh geez. All right, um

2153
03:55:20,180 --> 03:55:26,690
Well, okay. Hold on riddle me this riddle me this right? Let me ask you this

2154
03:55:27,329 --> 03:55:32,639
Would you want me to just do that tomorrow instead of Mario maker 2 and we'll do Mario maker 2 next week

2155
03:55:33,260 --> 03:55:48,500
Doesn't take that long. Yeah, but I really only I mean, I'm probably only gonna stream for like another couple hours. So

2156
03:55:50,500 --> 03:56:00,729
Absolutely not never play Mario maker. Well, we'll see how it goes. I'm gonna play it. Yeah, I guess I'll strike while the iron saw it

2157
03:56:00,729 --> 03:56:06,530
Yeah, all right. All right. Hey, listen, I know you just voted on a poll and I'm going to pretend like that poll never happened

2158
03:56:07,530 --> 03:56:08,989
so

2159
03:56:08,989 --> 03:56:13,030
Sorry, I will play that item shop game

2160
03:56:13,809 --> 03:56:16,569
Next week before we do Dark Souls remastered

2161
03:56:17,370 --> 03:56:18,450
randomizer

2162
03:56:18,450 --> 03:56:31,270
So you can expect that that can that's kind of what we'll do next week. What a democracy. What a great democracy. We got here

2163
03:56:31,790 --> 03:56:33,889
but the streamer just

2164
03:56:33,889 --> 03:56:41,809
Reverses everything he just said but let's open up a cook serve delicious and we'll do Mario maker tomorrow

2165
03:56:41,809 --> 03:56:47,559
Cuz that's like that's like a hot game. I mean I gotta play the hot game. Hopefully this is not loud

2166
03:56:47,559 --> 03:56:55,569
I can't believe you asked us. Well, I I thought that cooks

2167
03:56:55,569 --> 03:57:00,329
I thought that that item shop game was like and a good thing I you can probably hear it

2168
03:57:00,409 --> 03:57:21,930
I can't even change that you're trying to stay relevant by playing Mario maker

2169
03:57:22,450 --> 03:57:29,299
What do you what are you on about here? I gotta turn this way the fuck down. This is so loud
