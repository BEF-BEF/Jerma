1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:01:00,659
Uh, this is, uh, this is the game. It's not quite ready to start yet. Um, this is a game where you play, you run an item store, and you have to sell and trade products, and over the course of that time try to make as much money as possible to, um, I have no idea what this is.

2
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:10,140
I was told that this is a fun game. I can't skip this. Why can I no longer skip this?

3
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:43,090
Oh, hi, there we go. Hey everybody! Uh, hold on, I'm not ready yet. Just pretend I wasn't here. Okay, that's better. I actually did not mean to show you that, but I did.

4
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,969
Accident? No, I don't- why is this popping up? This is all- my stream deck is so wrong right now.

5
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:58,209
I better not fuck around with this, because if I turn the camera on, it's gonna be embarrassing. So, I'm just gonna do it by hand, manually.

6
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:10,340
Alright. Yeah, we're gonna play, uh, Recettear, and Item Shops Tales is something that people thought I would like.

7
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:19,789
It's about trading stocks, and, um, going on adventures with your friends, and you know how I love the markets.

8
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:39,659
Did I say it? Wait a minute, did I say it? What are you linking me? What is this?

9
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:48,259
What the fuck is this?

10
00:02:49,259 --> 00:03:06,789
What- what is this? That's a real ad. No, it's not. Somebody- one of you, like, meme aficionados doctored that shit. That's real.

11
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:26,550
Let me say it again, hold on. I'm- no, stop- this is so loud! Where is it? Why do I have a porn ad?

12
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,150
Somebody link it.

13
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,610
What is this implying? Is this implying that I'm chatting with this girl, or is she watching me?

14
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:56,180
Am I the porn, or are they the porn? I don't understand. Why this clip? Where did you get this gift from?

15
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:04,949
I'm the chatter? Turn this off.

16
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:16,360
I gotta- hold on, this is important. Why? Where did you find this?

17
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,180
Acting like he doesn't know.

18
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,199
What?

19
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:36,629
Alright, well that's fucking weird. I don't know what webs- don't go to this website, because they're probably just gonna, like, take your data.

20
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:49,889
I would be careful of that, like, data bait, so I don't know what that is. I don't endorse that website. I'm not part of that website.

21
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,470
Make sure you don't have your credit card on a notepad on your computer if you click on that link, okay?

22
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:10,209
Anyways, that's fucking odd, but- and of all the things, that's like- why wouldn't you take- I'm laughing!

23
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:21,839
I'm, like, laughing at that person. You don't, like, laugh at porn. You don't know- what? Is it porn, or is it just, like, a chat with me thing?

24
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:30,029
What do you mean you don't? That's so fucking funny.

25
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:34,029
What do I even do about that, though? That's the thing, right?

26
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:40,000
What the fuck am I supposed to do about that? Go get a lawyer?

27
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,649
Oh, hey, yes, this is Dick and Dick Associates. Hey, yeah, it's me, German985. Just put a call in. Somebody's using my face in a porn ad.

28
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:54,660
Do you know what company it is? I have no idea. They might be overseas.

29
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,279
Do you have any idea who it is?

30
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,279
No, I have absolutely no clue. Somebody linked it to me in chat.

31
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:09,649
Okay, um, you know, you're probably better off just- I gotta take another call.

32
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,360
You wanna sue him? Yeah!

33
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,300
Give me the person's name, where they're located, and what the business or country is located in.

34
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:27,100
Can't give you any of that. They're using my likeness to sell chatting software.

35
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:39,180
Unbelievable. It's me, like, of all the videos to pull.

36
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,670
Why wouldn't you pull one of me talking as if I was talking to you guys?

37
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,810
You know, like we sit here with the face cam on and I just talk?

38
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,740
Why would you take the one of me laughing at a baby running into a wall over and over again?

39
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,740
I've talked to the camera like a thousand times before.

40
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,040
I don't- whatever. We sit here.

41
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
An item shop's tail. This is what we're doing today.

42
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,379
Hope you had a good Fourth of July. Those of you that celebrated.

43
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:14,379
We don't need to hear the theme song again.

44
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,379
Alright, so this should be fun. It's a game about buying stocks.

45
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,379
I'm like stuck on repeat right now.

46
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:29,439
New game. Here we go. Can I skip all this?

47
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,439
Are you guys gonna be mad if I skip the whole thing?

48
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:38,089
Oh, for the love of- she's still asleep. No. No, yes. Don't skip it. Skip it.

49
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:42,579
Why is this Sesame Street music?

50
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:51,740
Alright, I- I'm gonna just- we're gonna do it normally.

51
00:07:51,740 --> 00:08:02,939
I'm not gonna skip. That was a pretty good fucking fat cloud.

52
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,500
Does she really not understand how important today is?

53
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm in bed? Why am I under the covers like that?

54
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,759
Merple. Can't eat another bite. That's my name. My name is Resetti.

55
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,829
Resiti. Is it Reset?

56
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:25,300
But I can always find room for yummy candy.

57
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Mimble-werble.

58
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,750
I've heard of like, mmm, or like, er, or, uh, Mimble-werble.

59
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,950
Oh, I'm so tired this morning. Mimble-werble.

60
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:48,740
Wake up, please. Is that me?

61
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,879
Whoa, whoa, what is it?

62
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,909
Oh, Tier. Good- good morning.

63
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:01,919
We do not have time for good morning, Resetti.

64
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,159
Are you planning on spending the rest of your life dreaming of sweets?

65
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,159
Today is the day we set for opening the store. I'm so- I'm way too excited for this.

66
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,299
Uh, we did? Oh, yeah, we did.

67
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,580
Merde.

68
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,399
Zero F all the-

69
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,399
Listen, go wash your face and make yourself presentable.

70
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,399
And then join me downstairs in the storefront.

71
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,870
Okay, I'll be right down.

72
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,870
Hey, sorry, I kept you waiting.

73
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:41,990
Okay, Tier, let's open the shop right now.

74
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,990
Capitalism ho.

75
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,740
Patience, Resetti. It is a virtue you will need.

76
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,460
We need to take care of a few matters before we open officially.

77
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,460
Everybody settle down for a second, because this game is like actually fun, I've heard.

78
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:03,230
Well, I somehow doubt that a store without anything to sell is going to attract all that much business.

79
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,269
Oh. Oh, yeah, we don't have anything to sell.

80
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:11,269
So, what do we do?

81
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,710
To start with, we need to establish a stock of items for the store.

82
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,720
If we have nothing to sell, we cannot claim to be much of a shop.

83
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,720
That's true. Hmm, so where should we go to get stocked up?

84
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,409
Let's go get like, liquor.

85
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:32,409
The best way, I think, would be to visit either the town market or the merchant's guild.

86
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:35,409
We need to give our regards to the head of the guild regardless.

87
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,409
So that should probably be our first stop.

88
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,799
Constant capitalism.

89
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,299
Oh, that's the place to run by that old guy, right?

90
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:48,299
We got an old guy. Can't let you do the old guy voice.

91
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,299
You know it's coming. I can't wait to do it.

92
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,299
The guild operates as a wholesaler for local merchants.

93
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,299
So if we stop by, we can purchase an initial stock.

94
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,299
It would not hurt Grover.

95
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:02,299
It would not hurt Grover.

96
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:06,860
Give up, give our polite regards to the guild chief either.

97
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,169
Especially since the guild is the organization that allows us to operate here in the first place.

98
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:13,169
Why does everybody have a guild?

99
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,299
Monster Ranch here, we gotta, there's a guild.

100
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:19,179
The rest of the tier, guild.

101
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,620
Who cares about the guild?

102
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,620
Okay, got it. Then let's go right now.

103
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,620
Hold on, that person's like, why is that person floating off the ground?

104
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,929
When you want to leave the shop, head to the front door currently located in the upper right hand corner of the store.

105
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:38,620
But I wanted to leave through the window like an action hero.

106
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,049
To infinity.

107
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:45,049
And beyond. They didn't want to get in trouble for that apparently.

108
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:46,049
Why?

109
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:47,929
Brassetti!

110
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:49,929
Okay, fine.

111
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:59,179
Oh, it's because it actually is, it's like a fairy or something.

112
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,179
Alright, so here's my store.

113
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,179
So we have to leave.

114
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,179
You didn't think there was going to be any action in this game.

115
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:08,129
You didn't think there was going to be any fucking running T-poses in this game, did you?

116
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,519
I know it's the easiest thing I could, alright, there's a lot to do here.

117
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,980
Alright, so we need to go to the merchant's guild.

118
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
This action will not take any time.

119
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,980
We have 1,000 picks.

120
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,500
Pictures of what?

121
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:31,190
Here comes the old guy.

122
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:40,860
A girl and a fairy, you two, yes, you're Brassetti and that Lone Shark.

123
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,490
I get to do an old person voice. I get to do an old man voice.

124
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,490
Well, that is not, well, an incorrect assessment.

125
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,490
Could I ask that you refrain from calling me Lone Shark?

126
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,690
That's right, mister.

127
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,309
She and I are partners, don't be mean.

128
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:01,919
Forgive me, forgive me, partners it is.

129
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,610
So, how are the preparations for running that shop coming along?

130
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,360
Quite well, thank you.

131
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,360
In fact, we plan on opening today, so we stopped by in order to show our gratitude for your help.

132
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Very good, you two know what you want.

133
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,159
If you have any problems, let me know, I'll be glad to help.

134
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,159
We appreciate your kindness, thank you.

135
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,720
I wish you a starting monster.

136
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,019
He'll grow up to be big and strong.

137
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,019
We appreciate your kindness, thank you, bye.

138
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,139
Not a problem at all, what are we going to buy from here?

139
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,139
So you came straight here to pick up some merchandise, right?

140
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:41,960
Well, up to the counter then, let's get you two sorted.

141
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,330
Are those two cigars on him? What is that?

142
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,330
He's got two cigar holders?

143
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,509
What's on his chest there?

144
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,509
Are those clothespins? I'm not sure what those are.

145
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,389
Those are pens, those are fat fucking pens.

146
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,779
Those are extra large Sharpies.

147
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,779
Those are not pens.

148
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,710
Is that first time?

149
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,710
Alright, I gotta pay attention to this.

150
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,710
Our funds are limited, so do not go completely overboard.

151
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,710
I recommend purchasing no more than ten items.

152
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,450
Buy, sell, talk.

153
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,940
Alright, so we need to stock up.

154
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,759
A worn out dented chipped sword.

155
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,759
Still better than going into the wild bare handed though.

156
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,769
140.

157
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,769
A standard lightweight long sword.

158
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,769
Perfect for novices learning the art of swordplay.

159
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,769
It's 840 bucks.

160
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:47,649
Alright, I just gotta...

161
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:49,649
Oh shit, there's more.

162
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,649
We have one item.

163
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,649
I didn't know there was more bars.

164
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,649
Hold on, how much are these?

165
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,460
I recommend ten items.

166
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,110
Oh.

167
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,110
Why can't I just lie about what the sword is?

168
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,110
That's how capitalism works.

169
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,110
I'm just gonna make up a story about why this thing is worth so much money.

170
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:17,029
Rusty dagger.

171
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,100
I can't even...

172
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,409
We can have two items. Leather gloves.

173
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:38,710
Wait, hold on, clothes.

174
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,779
Can I sell anything?

175
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,779
Sell it back to him?

176
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:45,779
Hey, we're running our item store here.

177
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,460
360.

178
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,320
This guy probably thinks we're like fucking morons.

179
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
What is the guild? What can I do here?

180
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,559
About merchant levels.

181
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,559
Merchant level is, well, your ability as a merchant.

182
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,559
As it goes up, you'll figure out how to redecorate or even expand your store.

183
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:12,250
Heck, you might even be able to convince me to let you have a look at some of our more premium items.

184
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,250
So they got drugs behind the counter.

185
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,490
You don't put your hands up and say premium with your fingers like that.

186
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,490
Unless it's something fucking illegal.

187
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,490
So...

188
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,490
How do you raise your level? Simple. Buy, sell, trade.

189
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,490
This is an art and you learn by doing.

190
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,659
If there's anything you don't know, just ask.

191
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,419
Okay.

192
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,779
Let's go sell it.

193
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,980
Let's go sell that sword.

194
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Aw, but unknown items.

195
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Now if you go dungeon diving, you'll find a lot of stuff which you won't be able to identify at first.

196
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:54,980
In particular, I'll bet my hat, you'll find a lot of what are commonly called mystery ingredients by the adventurers.

197
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
You can go dungeon diving.

198
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:03,149
At first you'll probably be tearing your hair out over all the junk you keep finding in those places.

199
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:10,150
But as your merchant level goes up, you'll be able to sort out the stuff you find and pick the best materials and whatnot from the lot.

200
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,150
Oh, and if you manage to get out of these death traps safely, you'll have time to identify everything safely.

201
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,150
That means you won't know what you're carrying till you leave.

202
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,150
Huh, that's interesting.

203
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,160
Alright, well let's go. Let's get out of here.

204
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,460
I got my merchandise.

205
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,769
Right then, will that be all?

206
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:30,259
Yep, this is perfect.

207
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,259
We shall return when our stocks run low again.

208
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:35,529
Haha, I'm looking forward to it.

209
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,529
Here, a little something extra as a start-up gift.

210
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,559
Bread from the ground.

211
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,559
Half of a donut. Walnut bread, thanks a bunch.

212
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,400
Alright little lady, give them your all.

213
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,859
Capitalism, ho.

214
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,480
Well, Adam Sandler would be proud of us at any rate.

215
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,019
Alright, we're gonna go back to recetteer.

216
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:10,339
Very well, it's time to give you a crash course on the basics of running an item shop.

217
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,339
I am so excited and I don't know why.

218
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,339
I was supposed to just relax today.

219
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,339
Okay, what do I do first?

220
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,339
First, we need to put some items on display.

221
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:21,339
We do not have our goods out for people to see.

222
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,339
We can hardly expect the customers to buy them after all.

223
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,980
Just need to get near these counters.

224
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,420
Just so, once you know where you wish to place something,

225
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,420
choose what you wish to place in that spot by pressing the primary button.

226
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Primary button?

227
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,660
You will understand when you try it, trust me.

228
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,660
Now remember, what you place will affect how people perceive the store.

229
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
So think carefully before you place something.

230
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,799
Okay, why not line up what we purchased on one of the counters?

231
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:01,410
Okay, so I have longsword and clothes.

232
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,410
Longsword has to be right here.

233
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,289
Base price, 1200 bucks.

234
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:11,579
That's the item that people are gonna be coming in.

235
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:13,579
And that's the one that lags your game.

236
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:18,720
Alright, then how about maybe in the back wall here?

237
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,660
Do it by the window.

238
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,220
No, I don't want to sell the bread.

239
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,700
I'm already getting talked to.

240
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,200
May I speak with you a moment?

241
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,440
What is it? What?

242
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Those counters by the window, items you place there are visible to anyone passing by on the street.

243
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,680
As such, putting eye-catching items, the sort of thing that makes you think,

244
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,680
I want to buy this more than anything, on those counters is a core principle of running a shop.

245
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,680
In a very real way, those counters are the face of the shop.

246
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,680
And what is placed there greatly affects interest in our business.

247
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,049
So choose what to place there very, very carefully.

248
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,049
Wow, I never thought about like that before.

249
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,049
Hokkai, I'll be careful.

250
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:24,369
So then, how do I pick it up?

251
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,369
I'm gonna put, oh, she likes the sword.

252
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:28,369
Look, you can use that sword to cut that bread.

253
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:32,769
I got it up here.

254
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,769
I'll put the clothes over here.

255
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:41,019
This is a window.

256
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,019
Can I talk to you for a minute?

257
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:47,460
You probably shouldn't cough near the bread.

258
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,460
I mean, you can, but we're gonna have to put a mask on you.

259
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,079
Are you sure it doesn't look dumb?

260
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,079
Do not worry, everything looks good. Enough for a first attack.

261
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:04,319
Now I need to teach you how to actually sell things.

262
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,319
Please go sit at the counter.

263
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:13,210
Oh, you're talking to me. You're talking about me.

264
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,049
Here they come.

265
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:22,420
Well, then the items are in place and now you need to learn how to actually sell things to people without embarrassing yourself.

266
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

267
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

268
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,539
Super Mario 3D World!

269
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:35,980
Alright, right.

270
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
Actually, sell things.

271
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,779
Hokkai, oh!

272
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:49,640
So to start with, I will lecture on the actual process of selling an item we have displayed.

273
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

274
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,950
I can't pay attention.

275
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,319
Alright.

276
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,890
if the students do not listen they do not get any credit right right right now then when a customer

277
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:17,880
enters be sure to greet them with a nice big welcome uh welcome greeting the customer helps

278
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,839
them feel comfortable and relaxed while in the store their comfort is fundamental to our business

279
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,519
remember that as we continue now a typical customer will find an item they want on our

280
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:33,000
display and then they will come over to the counter to pay for it let me demonstrate could

281
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:45,190
i get this please um um um i don't know let me think about that i i i'm a store and i have things

282
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,950
that people pay me to give them i don't know what they want will be in the target window

283
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:59,099
you will also be able to see the name and the base price pay close attention to that base price

284
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:04,579
also if you press button three you can view expanded it well i don't what's that on

285
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:15,700
xbox consult the custom dot exe program included with resit here if you wish to check or alter

286
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:24,970
your button configuration wait button three custom dot exe focus your life is hard enough to

287
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:30,680
control as it is uh okay now the next you must decide what price you wish to offer

288
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,720
in general you want to try and name a price higher than the base try naming a price if

289
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:43,579
you will uh let's see you likely notice that the base price serves as your default

290
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:52,569
to raise your offer press up press up okay is this an android learning how to do things as a

291
00:23:52,569 --> 00:24:07,859
pro i don't understand that's not gonna happen all right let's do uh 116 percent of base price

292
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:08,500
1500

293
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:50,039
is that gonna work a fair price oh what oh oh shit i get how do i get this off um

294
00:24:50,039 --> 00:25:09,930
i can't put that on zero there we are i got i gotta get it i'll only need just one person

295
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:25,210
to buy that and i'll be good okay i'm gonna say uh 1350 very good that is how you adjust

296
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:32,890
your offer this might be obvious if a customer is satisfied with your offer it is a sale and

297
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:38,470
you get a little bit of experience along with the money if your price is too high however

298
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,109
a customer can simply walk out learning to determine the proper price there lies the

299
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:47,349
challenge now if a customer disagrees with the price but not so much that they want to

300
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:53,000
storm out then you can negotiate remember what i said about comfort earlier and that is the

301
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,319
key here offer price but do not make it so outrageous that the customer feels you were not

302
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:04,519
acting in good faith 112 is fine so if they disagree but stay offer them a new price

303
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,920
ideally you will lower your offer a little and they will take it and give you a sale

304
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,319
some customers may just be trying to sniff out a better price when they're really willing to

305
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,200
pay your initial price however whether or not you risk testing that possibility is up to you

306
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,720
how long can you well that depends on how long can you keep haggling depends

307
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,599
on how regular a customer the person in the question is as we're starting out you will not

308
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,079
be able to haggle for very long but after customers begin to trust us a little you

309
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:40,119
can haggle for a longer period of time well time to put the theory into practice um okay

310
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:49,660
why isn't why why aren't you the boss and you the fairy if i'm the manager i come in and

311
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,500
i switch them i say you put the wings on and you go stand behind that counter this is like

312
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:04,390
fucking stupid uh juno upset i'll just give 10 community subs thank you thanks with the 10

313
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:14,299
community subs much love to you uh could i get this please oh okay i pick a price right needs

314
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:27,980
to be higher than the base uh up button uh customer will likely buy immediately knife the

315
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,859
fine art of haggling theoretically what you wish to do is lower your price slowly but as

316
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:37,579
i mentioned there is a limit how long you can haggle the idea is to deduce a customer's

317
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:45,509
desired price and go from there you say deduce the desired price but how do i the large number

318
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:52,490
of stores sell at about 30 over base price 30 it is not a hard and fast rule but people

319
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:58,059
will usually accept that price level usually if you can manage to go over that you will make

320
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:03,589
a lot of money but you do not want to risk driving away a customer right then so as a

321
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:23,509
customer i am haggling could you make it a little bit cheaper okay oh shit you want it cheap by

381
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:23,829

him is how tough he is he'll be okay is it dad is that burp papa wouldn't knock who is that

385
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:08,730
who is it there's nobody there wait what's at my feet here good evening um you are mademoiselle

386
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:16,260
reset lemongrass uh miss fairy pardon me but i am the one asking the questions

387
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:25,619
again you are reseti lemongrass um yes i'm reset my name is tier i'm an agent of the

388
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:34,099
term finance company finance company i'm here to collect payment on the loan paid out to your

389
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:45,769
father here is the contract and my identification um loan repayment uh in plainter terms i'm here

390
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:51,289
to get our money back and another thing about loans let's talk about fucking loans and how

391
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:57,610
they if you are incapable of facilitating repayment this house will be seized as

392
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:11,210
collateral in order to pay the loan i tell you this this person doesn't even know anything

393
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:21,659
facilitating collateral huh seize what

394
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:41,769
papa is he's not here yes i see that now uh monsieur lemongrass disappeared following a

395
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:53,019
fracas atop the local volcano so we assumed he might have returned here even if he has not

396
00:39:53,019 --> 00:40:00,360
however the contract covers this eventuality covers this quite as the some i'm not gonna

397
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,510
read her lines anymore quite as the sole remaining member of his household we shall

398
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:14,179
require that you pay his debts in his stead i barely have enough money to live by myself

399
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:18,820
naturally we're not demanding it all be repaid at once there's still a small amount of

400
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:26,039
time before any payment is due therefore am i gonna get sold off in parts to distant foreign

401
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:33,239
lands to repay papa's debts i wonder if i can survive with only two internal organs

402
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,179
maybe if i eat a lot of spinach that can replace my blood

403
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:54,659
all right i'm sorry guys but she's pretty dumb you know like we've seen a lot of

404
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,179
sentence repeating thinking if you eat spinach it's gonna replace blood like you i mean come on

405
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:10,699
ahem please listen to me for a moment i have no clue where you're getting these

406
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:15,340
ludicrous ideas from but i would never do such a thing quite the opposite in fact

407
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,260
i was sent here to ensure that you wouldn't have to resort to such well absurd methods

408
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:26,469
to pay us back instead let me give you a different solution work for us for the rest of

409
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:38,679
your life 10 to 12 hours a day paying slowly back until you're 80 i've been sent to support

410
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:47,929
you to the fullest of my ability so that you may repay the debt via labor wait what but i've

411
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:58,420
never worked a single day in my life experience is no bearing no no work experience all that

412
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:07,030
matters is whether or not you are willing to work uh that was not the kind of response

413
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:15,420
that i would have assumed would happen from that why would you just go oh if you do not wish

414
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:22,199
to work then that is that the house is mine and i will have to ask you to leave the premises

415
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,579
as the saying goes those who do not work do not eat so miss lemongrass which will it be

416
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:38,920
work or the house yes remember happy gilmore his grandfather built that fucking house with

417
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:47,750
his bare hands and then that dickhead comes along that golf pro trying to like buy it

418
00:42:48,309 --> 00:43:04,900
spoilers by the way for happy gilmore what can i even do i already have an idea this is the

419
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:10,599
backstory the city is an adventuring hub in addition this house faces out onto one of the

420
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:16,440
main city lanes therefore i propose converting this house into a store i would be like take

421
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:25,179
the fucking house you like cold-hearted piece of shit so you already own the store it did

422
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:36,539
just take the house well we won't take your house we'll just turn it into our house but

423
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:53,219
you can still sleep here just just squish the fairy yeah dude like come on i can't turn the

424
00:43:53,219 --> 00:44:00,539
webcam on but i kind of have to just listen to sasame street music for a second this is

425
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:32,869
important all right so yeah what what what's stopping you from going from doing something

426
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:37,510
like this you know she's saying all these things like oh yeah we're gonna like own your

427
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:45,530
house and oh yeah your father is a fucking adventurer just like yeah oh yeah go ahead

428
00:44:45,530 --> 00:45:17,989
tell me follow us what got you she's not that small how do you know she'd survive

429
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:33,130
did i lose my why did i lose this i was only gone for a little while to do market research

430
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:48,679
where could she have gone i'm like sleeping under the covers like fucking sad all i did

431
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,360
was threaten to take away everything she ever knew and loved asking her to turn the house

432
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:58,980
into an item shop was foolish even if it was to repay the debt the poor girl must be terribly

433
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:06,460
confused and on top of that her father is probably uh oh wait what's going on why is

434
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:18,840
the house being filled with like yayness it's done hey tier look it's done what is that

435
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:26,119
oh it's our shop sign of course doesn't it look cool but but it's on the ground oh of

436
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,840
course it's on the ground isn't that interesting how it's on the ground what what would be under

437
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:47,340
the ground here what are you what are you doing oh you know it's your grave you can't be a shop

438
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:57,179
without one of these you know yes well it's quite made well made he he said oh by the way

439
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:03,349
before i started uh i need to make this really clear before the stream started i was in chat

440
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:07,989
we were just talking and like talking about stuff and having fun and chilling and stuff

441
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:16,090
i wrote ha ha ha and everybody mocked me for doing it and i realized that you i can no longer

442
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:24,840
write like he he or like ha ha in text anymore because it's seen as like weird ironic fake

443
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:37,849
like laughing i can't run you cannot write ha ha ha ever again you have to do an emote now

444
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:44,869
it's seen as like a kappa ha ha ha oh yeah funny right no no i actually thought that was

445
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:55,530
funny well do the right emote then be that as it may while the sign is nice i am is there a

446
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:04,260
problem well the name you're quite sure that you have thought that through well we're partners

447
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:17,190
right you said so so put reset and tear together and reset here isn't it neat well that is to

448
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:24,710
say the sentiment is commendable but it's the two of us opening the store so the name should

449
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:29,030
reflect that right you don't like it really it's not that but well

450
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:42,329
okay your risk of tear that's awful why would you put tear it you know there's no reason for

451
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:52,760
that mispronounced it even slightly and reket tear racket racketeer this job is going to be

452
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:01,849
even more absurdly difficult than i originally suspected i fear and so a fairy suddenly

453
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:19,050
entered my life one thing was for sure this sure wasn't going to be dull how is it possible

that's up to your judgment if you sit at the counter we can open immediately

465
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,940
or we can reorganize the shop or we could even go search for new stock

466
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:57,590
around town or elsewhere yikes that's a ton of options how do i choose

467
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,650
it is as i said earlier running a place like this is more of an art than it is something

468
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,969
you can simply follow a map through simply pick something we will deal with what comes

469
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:19,940
okay welcome to recetteer all right i have 130 bucks how long is the day day two

470
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,800
how much money do i have not enough i need to sell this thing i gotta sell the sword

471
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:42,090
let's do it open the store wait hold on town square pub chapel adventurers guild

472
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:54,650
i mean it's blinking this shit's blinking hey what's this place this is the adventurers

473
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,170
guild the guild manages expeditions to the various untamed wilderness areas there have

474
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:01,449
been ruins in the city the area is commonly referred to as dungeons without approval

475
00:52:01,449 --> 00:52:05,050
adventurers cannot visit dungeons you have to get approved ah we can't just go into the

476
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,530
dungeon to pick up everything now why what the heck we could get a ton of profit and shit

477
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,489
it's still a very good idea great many people evade that you can go into the dungeon and

478
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:16,010
get stuff and collect it and sell it but you have to identify it we must first hire an

479
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:23,719
adventurer can i just pick anybody the truth of the matter is a bit more complicated even

480
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,880
if you pay them few adventures are willing to risk their lives simply for the benefit

481
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,519
of a complete stranger mostly they turn away people when they don't know but yes

482
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,019
get to know a few adventures and build up a certain level of trust with them

483
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,659
if all goes well they will give you a symbol of their guild membership this usually takes the

484
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:47,750
form of a card with that in hand we can bring an adventurer with us so it's like they're

485
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:55,000
inviting us to a dinner party no you're going into a dungeon where you might both die see

486
00:52:58,039 --> 00:53:03,050
attempting to rip you limb for i said i said it first but the analogy does work somewhere

487
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:08,809
right so first i need to meet adventurer where do you meet adventurers at the bar

488
00:53:08,809 --> 00:53:12,170
after all we run an item shop we should get a few coming in as clients on a fairly

489
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:18,730
regular basis all right we're gonna sell that sword to somebody let's go get a dinner invitation

490
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:26,980
indeed just be careful that reset is not on the menu huh is something wrong well that guy

491
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:36,920
over there listen to me if i can't work i can't get the money and if i can't get the money

492
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,840
i can't get the items and if i can't get the items apparently i can't work

493
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,599
heaven if i had a few things i could at least visit the hall of trials

494
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:54,760
oh i wonder what's going on he seems to be a rookie adventurer complaining about his inability

495
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,960
to complete the required guild test oh test it is guild test the guild hardly allows anyone

496
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,960
off the street you can only work officially with the guild after passing tears and items up

497
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,789
owners hardly the only every episode of every single one of these i've ever watched i have an

498
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:20,579
idea sorry i do believe we have found our first adventurer wait what do you mean by uh tier

499
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:30,630
weight oh son of a i burn what cash i had just getting to the city if i can't get into the

500
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:35,030
guild i don't know what i'll even do for dinner money now i'm hungry great

501
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,579
excuse me pardon me a moment are you there adventurer with the seedy look who you calling

502
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:53,849
seedy well you two would be uh we're a pair of merchants who happen to be passing

503
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:00,650
merchants oh you heard me talking sorry but i'm way too broke and seedy to buy anything

504
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,519
believe me i could tell about your seedy nature that you're attempting to sell you

505
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:12,860
anything would be a colossal waste of time now come on tier stop with the seedy already he

506
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:23,800
isn't a plant minus two by the way so are you two going to prune me or what here would

507
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,639
you like it if we came with you to the hall of trials if you require equipment or items

508
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:37,369
we can provide them i'd call you a pair of angels then but why business naturally we help you pass

509
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:43,619
the trial you provide us with your card oh i get it we help mr swordsman clear the dungeon

510
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:56,500
and then he gives us his card a sign of our eternal friendship very dumb uh eternal friendship

511
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,219
is rather irrelevant in this case but it does work out neatly for all of us what do you say

512
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:08,230
i see you guys are pretty new at all this too huh oh that was i i did that one pretty i

513
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:14,280
phoned that part that was a phoned in line i'll offer mr swordsman yes or no yes

514
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:24,780
that wasn't me i swear that was in the game all right then heck i got nothing to lose while

515
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:33,019
aside from my precious life anyway yayifications glad to meet you too uh i'm reset nice to meet

516
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:41,190
you what's your name um what's louis call me louis louis the swordsman good to meet you

517
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,639
yes yes now then we will begin all the preparations for a dungeon visit

518
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,199
is he gonna die including a visit to the central market to pick up food and other

519
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:57,690
restorative items we'll then return here for you when we are ready right i'll be waiting here

520
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:14,659
all right so now we have to go to the we have to go get food um the apple is a bit sour

521
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:23,190
so it's best used in jam or a pie um he's a too much money i can buy bread this town

522
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:29,139
staple snack walnuts soft dough and a bit of sugar make it perfect i guess i'm gonna buy

523
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:44,889
two breads one bread can i can i like chase down the lady i sold the bread to all right

524
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:55,860
will he live off of one bread he's got a worn sword leather armor wooden shield old muffler

525
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:07,690
why does he have a muffler on uses sore okay leave leave level one swordsman louis pick the

526
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:16,980
items you wish to bring with you and finish like the depart option you got one bread let's go the

527
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:27,579
hall of trials so this is the dungeon just so welcome to the jungle as they say and another

528
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:35,619
hour long tutorial on how to control in combat i'm not a monster slayer i'm scared the two of

529
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:39,619
us are perfectly safe there's a protective field around the two of us to the monsters

530
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:47,690
we may as well be invisible so why are you on screen you could have just not put them on screen

531
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:55,460
you could have just sent this guy down louis perfectly safe too then no no not quite actually

532
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:03,210
uh well louis is uh you know louis could see some problems in the next few minutes

533
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:06,420
we don't have to worry but this is accomplished by making us virtually

534
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,219
intangible to everything inside this place we can directly manipulate nothing

535
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:17,750
we can't collect things why are we in here that's why our adventurer remains outside the field

536
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:23,400
so this guy picks up stuff should i venture be injured we can place him in the field

537
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:29,159
and retreat since we must carry him back however we can take very little else with us

538
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:34,650
one item at most so even if we run into trouble we don't lose everything but wait

539
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:38,650
i thought you said we can't yes i will elaborate further if need be later i'm not

540
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:45,110
going to press that button we can bring as much as our bags will allow us to carry if we get out

541
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:54,179
safely cool wait as much as our bags will allow well you have bags too yep yep the adventurers

542
00:59:54,179 --> 01:00:00,340
focus on adventuring while we keep track of what to loot you got it cool k o day let's get

546
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:48,599

not at all you can always head back to the floor that had a door on it in fact if you do not use

636
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:14,149
a door you do have to restart okay that's good to know so if you find a door always use it

637
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:21,130
returning home takes time furthermore leaving ends the current contract with our companion

638
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:26,579
and we would have to rehire him or choose a new one if there is something specific in a

639
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:32,039
dungeon that you desire you can simply ignore the doors and press onward so it is stardew

707
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:21,319
oh this will do souvenir charm can you sell it for just a little less all right there

708
01:26:21,319 --> 01:26:28,760
i'm old and i think that 399 is the same thing as 400 because i've been conditioned to think that

709
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:35,239
for some reason 99 of some sense means it's way less thank you have a good day

710
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:49,979
oh it's me again you know how much for this piece of clothing it's a little too expensive

711
01:26:49,979 --> 01:27:03,739
for me 99 cents that's a fair deal for me thank you oh it's me again i don't you have such

712
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:21,319
good prices at your store how much is this bread oh it's 99 cents i'll take it looking for

713
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:32,140
something i want this oh right i should have done 199 i was scamming myself uh well

714
01:27:32,779 --> 01:27:50,470
well young lady that'll be um well could you make it a little cheaper this is getting dumb

715
01:27:55,029 --> 01:27:59,430
that's getting like trouble because i was like selling like something too expensive to like

716
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:16,779
child wait she wasn't buying like a knife right what was she buying was that a plant

717
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:25,979
bread bread okay i know she wasn't buying like a sword or anything well then you seem to

718
01:28:25,979 --> 01:28:29,100
have developed a basic understanding of how to sell things to people and not drive them

719
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:34,460
to burn the shop in anger yepperoni yepperoni

720
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:46,890
why does it what i feel like my mother just texted me back yes being a truly great store

721
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:50,250
owner involves more than selling things however there are there are times when people will want

722
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:57,300
to sell items to you really i suspect we'll begin to get such offers very soon

723
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:02,630
but i already buy stuff from the guild and the market so why should i worry about buying

724
01:29:02,789 --> 01:29:07,430
stuff from the customers there's one major difference between a guild or a market purchase

725
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:13,989
and a purchase from an individual individuals do not have set prices in other words you can

726
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:21,720
scam them as you do while you're selling haggled down oh so i can get stuff really cheap but

727
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:26,600
that seems like it'd be pretty hard fundamentally buying and selling are not that different

728
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,840
the customer shows you an item they wish to sell and then you set a price and perhaps

729
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:37,979
negotiate obviously you wish to pay less than the base price of the item okay so buy

730
01:29:37,979 --> 01:29:44,970
high and sell low that sounds like what i do on markets all the time just so that is the very

731
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:50,010
core of a successful business now then shall we practice the fundamental procedure is the same

732
01:29:50,010 --> 01:30:01,000
as when selling okay welcome to recetteer uh would you buy this from me hmm let me

733
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:15,159
need to name a price 1096 at this level there will not be much profit when we resell

734
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:24,779
go somewhat lower really all right this this is like a knockoff at this point eight percent of

735
01:30:24,779 --> 01:30:33,000
base price 826 excellent this is a good price level now then let us practice haggling over

736
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,460
the price it's the same now that you have offered a price you believe to be fair adjust

737
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:42,300
your offer until you agree to sell to you could you offer me a little more i think it's

738
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:51,880
worth a lot 50 and 70 percent of the base is a good target you will gain an item to sell without

739
01:30:51,880 --> 01:31:06,710
giving up too much money let's go welcome uh what would you be willing to pay for this

740
01:31:07,989 --> 01:31:27,380

758
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:32,810

766
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:59,220
oh it's a yam it's a really expensive yam oh you're old hold on give me one second let me pick this

767
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:05,699
up uh this is a rock it's a rock yes it's a rock this is only this is worth nothing oh sorry

768
01:36:06,579 --> 01:36:28,710
thank you bye you can have it i'd like this 100 120 that seems fair holy cow it's late

769
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:33,350
times seem to fly by today speaking of time i plan on doing some mild schedule management

770
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:37,590
for you from now on to ensure you're working in an effective manner to pay back the debt

771
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:47,380
what are you talking about i've broken up the day into four time periods morning afternoon

772
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:54,119
evening and night what you can do and how much you can do depends on the time of day

773
01:36:54,920 --> 01:37:01,699
hey yeah the clock's been broken up into four areas think of each part as a slice of time

774
01:37:02,869 --> 01:37:09,510
a slice like pie yeah okay i thought i would be able to keep your attention if i made it

775
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:14,390
rather similar to some sort of sweet food so this is the morning slice the afternoon i'm

776
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:27,590
getting hungry so this four sections of the day you can only act between morning and night

777
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:31,829
yes when night ends you need to go to bed trying to run a shop while sleep deprived is

778
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:38,390
unpleasant so i'll close up when it gets late so you essentially have two options for each slice

779
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:44,149
you can open the store for a time or go about town on business you can't do both at once so

780
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:50,550
decide in advance what you need to do to be clear opening the shop will consume a slice

781
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:54,949
and returning to the store after going out regardless of what you actually did

782
01:37:54,949 --> 01:38:00,520
will also consume a slice but what if i go to like the plaza and then the chapel

783
01:38:01,779 --> 01:38:08,340
slice slice you can get around town easily enough to avoid consuming a slice with each move

784
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:12,979
only when you return to the store will the clock advance a slice so in that case i should do a

785
01:38:12,979 --> 01:38:20,500
lot when i leave the shop yes that's a good attitude to take now there's another vital element

786
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:28,500
leaving town all together visiting a dungeon will consume two slices no matter what that takes

787
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:35,539
that long so if i go in the morning and i'll get back in the evening that's precisely how it works

788
01:38:35,539 --> 01:38:40,659
thus you can only leave for a dungeon at an early point in the day if it is night or you

789
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:46,020
have done something else that evening you cannot go because if i did go i'd get back

790
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:51,779
real late right exactly not only would you annoy your adventurer companions with staying

791
01:38:51,779 --> 01:38:55,779
out so late you would also be dead on your feet the next day after returning

792
01:38:56,739 --> 01:39:04,470
man this is a lot to wrap my head around you guys ever watch uh training videos company training

793
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:12,819
videos i'm getting that vibe right now this is go watch go watch the pizza hut training video

794
01:39:12,819 --> 01:39:18,340
i watch it all the time we're making it great i'm not kidding i like lie in bed and watch

795
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:33,210
training videos i don't know they're like soothing to me i don't know why that's sad

796
01:39:33,210 --> 01:39:39,239
what do you mean that's sad i'll have my ipad and like kim will be next to me and will it be

797
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:44,199
like okay good but good night go to i'm going to bed we'll be like on our devices and i'll

798
01:39:44,199 --> 01:39:58,409
load up the wendy's training video it's like 45 minutes long and i just watch it it's it's

799
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:08,060
like an infomercial before you know it you will be thinking about it naturally you guys yeah

800
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:11,739
don't you don't you put the sauce in the middle and you go out you leave about a half

801
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:14,300
an inch on the edge you don't put the sauce all the way to the edge of the pizza

802
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:19,819
and you want to line the toppings up with the sauce never to go over that edge of the pizza

803
01:40:19,819 --> 01:40:30,939
especially when making a pan pizza well it helps that you will always be able to see how much

804
01:40:30,939 --> 01:40:34,939
time a particular action will consume simply pay attention to the clock i want to make sure

805
01:40:34,939 --> 01:40:40,600
weigh out all your cheese and stuff and you do a top cheese as well the dough master in

806
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,800
the morning will give you uh and if there's any bubbles or it doesn't look very good

807
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:54,539
report it to the dough master and use another one i will be glad to go over it as often as

808
01:40:54,539 --> 01:41:06,659
you need i don't think i need to go over i'm actually a dough master so you know what i'm

809
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:15,399
talking about all right so i got like i can open the store one more time look at this shit baked

01:42:39,739 --> 01:42:43,260

01:44:03,159 --> 01:44:21,609
dollar oh yeah excuse me miss i would like to ask you if i could buy this please sir would do

828
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:28,310
weren't you in here yesterday yesterday i don't know what you're talking about i don't i haven't

829
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:46,489
been here oh that'll do thank you what a scam all right i can't help but notice what you just

830
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:54,470
did to that old man i'm reporting you i'm reporting you to osha hey could i purchase

831
01:44:54,470 --> 01:45:12,260
this yeah you sure can 350 gee i sold an apple so this do you think i could turn it into a bit

832
01:45:12,260 --> 01:45:30,779
of coin so you're selling me this candy okay i mean like maybe got it i almost have ten thousand

833
01:45:30,779 --> 01:45:38,649
dollars you seem more or less used to the basics of running a shop there's one of the

834
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:42,329
matter however you cannot always be certain that a customer will know what they want when

835
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:47,880
come in what are you talking about they may come in thinking oh what should i make for dinner

836
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,960
what would be a good weapon and so forth they will not be quite sure exactly what they wish

837
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:56,199
to purchase when they come through our door in such a case we must provide them with advice

838
01:45:56,199 --> 01:46:03,210
to help them decide wait wait how could i do that many customers will simply give up if they

839
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:08,409
do not find something suitable for their needs on our counters others whoever will realize

840
01:46:08,409 --> 01:46:12,409
that we may have reserved stock and we would require as to whether or not we have something

841
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:17,000
they seek that's when you may suggest an item you think they would like

842
01:46:23,289 --> 01:46:28,199
okay you'll impress them if you know what they want and you'll cause them to return

843
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:42,819
no pressure then okay let's practice kk welcome i would like a sword please so anything is okay

844
01:46:42,819 --> 01:46:47,699
as long as it's a sword ultimately you must pick something the person would like by the

845
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:52,260
way if i may give you a little advice if you sell weapons and armor to your adventurer friends

846
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:58,439
they will equip the items you sell them meaning of course that if you sell items to them then

847
01:46:58,439 --> 01:47:04,170
we do not need to lend them any items at the start of a dungeon and we'll be able to bring

848
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:10,739
back more items for our own use even if an adventurer must retreat while in a dungeon

849
01:47:10,739 --> 01:47:16,550
the equipment is not lost since it's in their possession so we're just going to

850
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:22,699
scam all the whole way we're doing like meta scamming so we want to sell to our

851
01:47:22,699 --> 01:47:28,550
adventurer friends even if you must undersell it to them well we don't have to do that don't worry

852
01:47:29,539 --> 01:47:32,899
accessories work the same way so think carefully about who you sell what to

853
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:39,369
and what effect it may have on their performance so that guy came in and he bought

854
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:45,050
the armband so if i get any cool armor or weapons only sell it to the adventurers

855
01:47:49,619 --> 01:47:53,140
you can see what that person currently has and see if it's better than that's cool

856
01:47:54,760 --> 01:48:01,380
all right let's go i'd like a sword please i got one for you here it's a steel sword yes excellent

871
01:51:08,550 --> 01:51:15,399
yeah that guy doesn't know how to negotiate i don't some people don't like negotiating

872
01:51:15,399 --> 01:51:20,470
i'm not i don't really like it some people you know if somebody says oh that's uh

873
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:27,239
but here's the problem with negotiating you this is why like that this world is so fucking

874
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:33,880
dumb okay you can't like go into a macy's and negotiate the price of a pair of pants

875
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,000
you can't walk up to the fucking counter at macy's with like a fair pair of fucking jeans

876
01:51:40,539 --> 01:51:45,460
uh this this says 80 i want to pay 60 uh sir what the fuck are you talking about

877
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:51,779
security we have like a fucking weirdo at the front desk but you can do that with

878
01:51:51,779 --> 01:52:01,510
other forms of property why you can negotiate some places but other places you

879
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:05,350
you'll get like arrested if you try to tell them you're gonna pay 50 dollars for the 80 dollar

880
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:21,109
jeans you can do that with a house but not a pair of sandals that's what i'm saying

881
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:29,859
negotiation is such a strange thing i can't like negotiate with the guy at the bar how

882
01:52:29,859 --> 01:52:38,979
much the drink is all right i want to go buy some stuff i have a lot of money yeah that's

884
01:52:45,939 --> 01:52:49,779
this fucking guy out of here and then you like cut to you getting like thrown out onto

885
01:52:49,779 --> 01:53:08,060
the street all right let's go to the market hmm tree seed necklace cloth cape wait hold on

890
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:16,659
you understand even in the same town it's not consistent okay all right let's go let me look

891
01:54:16,659 --> 01:54:25,000
what's in the chapel say terry you came from a finance company right what on earth yes that's

892
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:32,500
right i work for term e finance i got what do you mean i don't have enough time to do this

893
01:54:34,119 --> 01:54:41,260
you're employed by them right what's it like no that's not quite accurate i was contracted to

894
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:47,960
term me through another organization thus i'm not really an employee per se so you just

895
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:53,720
contracted i'm surprised you seem so it's not that surprising almost all fairies in human

896
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:59,880
society belong to a fairy specific contract agency there are of course a few free agent

897
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:09,350
fairies out there as well and so that's how it works oh yeah it's like a baseball team

898
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:13,029
yes i have to tell the truth it can be difficult for fairies to find employment in human

899
01:55:13,029 --> 01:55:20,890
society so the agencies were founded an age ago in order to help facilitate fairy livelihoods

in a bathroom somewhere thank you hey i'm back again i'm thinking about getting a shield too

1111
02:35:27,799 --> 02:35:32,819
i'm thinking of throwing the spear out the window you know the one i just bought from you

1112
02:35:33,379 --> 02:35:38,819
and then going down my elevator and running out the front door and blocking it with the

1113
02:35:38,819 --> 02:35:44,620
shield i mean i i've lived like 600 stories after i think it's possible and i'm gonna make

1114
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:51,479
a youtube video on it and do a slow motion that sounds like a really cool video idea

1115
02:35:52,899 --> 02:36:11,659
now that's too expected oh that's fine this is a present from mommy this girl is hard to

1116
02:36:11,659 --> 02:36:22,780
sell to let's just go with like let's go with like 103 i'm seeing pretty good on money

1117
02:36:27,180 --> 02:36:31,579
i don't know i can do the one more run on the store here furball

1118
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:43,290
um kind of running out items i have so many capes i'm never selling those capes i'm gonna hold

1119
02:36:43,290 --> 02:37:01,110
those capes to zero what the garbage wait hold on how are we doing like politically here

1120
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:15,139
all right keep that there let's get the capes look okay here's here's the thing

1121
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:25,049
you want to know my strategy right now here's the strategy there's only capes in the store so

1122
02:37:26,229 --> 02:37:44,819
you have to buy one if that's the only thing right i was walking by and i noticed

1123
02:37:44,819 --> 02:37:56,469
you had the wife asked me to get some food perfect bread seems about right

1124
02:37:57,750 --> 02:38:06,760
any capes um you don't have some food do you you need more food

1125
02:38:08,729 --> 02:38:16,540
uh did you eat it before you left oh i screwed it up again oh boy

1126
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:22,760
i was supposed to bring that food back to the wife and i ate it before i left the store

1127
02:38:23,799 --> 02:38:41,659
i wouldn't have any food all right time to pay the debt i have enough

1128
02:38:50,299 --> 02:38:53,420
should i just like tie the capes together and sell it as a parachute

1129
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:58,680
i mean look if you want to be a good entrepreneur and a good business man

1130
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:06,219
business woman you you adapt those are all two thousand dollars each no capes are boring but

1131
02:39:06,219 --> 02:39:11,500
if you tie them together and you make a giant parachute for 10 grand all of a sudden it's

1132
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:18,760
really interesting uh incidentally you are aware that today is the first day of collections

1133
02:39:20,459 --> 02:39:28,309

1137
02:39:57,190 --> 02:40:07,270

1163
02:45:07,059 --> 02:45:16,629
has like 10 kilos of gold in his house he just takes a razor and just shaves the top every

1164
02:45:16,629 --> 02:45:31,780
day and buys it every once all right i think it's time for bed it's a plus four slime

1165
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:43,319
i'm out of inventory so all we got is you know hold on let's go get a drink

1166
02:45:45,479 --> 02:45:50,600
what is it why are adventurers in the pub so often do they all like alcohol that much

1167
02:45:51,319 --> 02:45:56,200
well adventurers certainly do enjoy their liquid pleasure but a pub like this also handles

1168
02:45:56,200 --> 02:46:02,549
quests for adventures really many of the people here are looking for work isn't that kind of

1169
02:46:02,549 --> 02:46:07,190
stuff handled by the adventurers guild the guild does also handle some quests but remember you can

1170
02:46:07,190 --> 02:46:12,790
only hire a guild adventurer officially if you possess the guild card of that person assuming

1171
02:46:12,790 --> 02:46:17,739
they have one at all therefore places like this tend to offer a different kind of quest

1172
02:46:17,739 --> 02:46:23,260
more daily run-of-the-mill business if you will clients do not pay as much as guild

1173
02:46:23,260 --> 02:46:29,020
sponsored ones but this sort of place is also far friendlier to rookies however if the

1174
02:46:29,020 --> 02:46:34,059
request is too simple or moronic it is likely that no one will even attempt to do it

1175
02:46:35,739 --> 02:46:39,020
look the requests are posted up there on the wall let us have a look shall we

1176
02:46:40,299 --> 02:46:45,260
let's see please find my lost kitty can i hire someone to stand in a ticket line for me

1177
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:51,899
please kill 10 crows around the garbage dump green item offered can one of you hot studs

1178
02:46:53,770 --> 02:46:59,129
wow there's quite a variety well it's true that they are often used as glorified handymen

1179
02:46:59,209 --> 02:47:03,940
in a way this sort of thing is a sign of how much adventurers have blended into daily city

1180
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:11,579
life in this city that's true hey actually we should do this quest i mean i'd love to help

1181
02:47:11,579 --> 02:47:18,010
someone find their kitty uh no i'm afraid we cannot well anyone can post a request only those

1182
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:23,850
registered with the adventurers guild can legally take on such requests so i'm afraid

1183
02:47:23,850 --> 02:47:29,659
we cannot do anything listed here that's a bummer so why do we keep coming here why not

1184
02:47:29,659 --> 02:47:36,040
even like old enough to go in here how do we keep getting in the front door

1185
02:47:42,620 --> 02:47:49,899
i heard the door open who is it oh it's two children two children well whatever i'm just

1186
02:47:49,899 --> 02:48:01,159

1199
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:21,129
the best way to learn about your foe is direct infiltration after all that's an amazon

1200
02:50:21,129 --> 02:50:28,520
box and with strategic espionage ability such as this i can't fail who's under that box

1201
02:50:29,319 --> 02:50:35,260
um who's that the interior decoration is as seedy and plebeian as the outside

1202
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:39,180
which means their selection of items will see astounding what could it be what sort of thing

1203
02:50:39,180 --> 02:50:44,299
could that filthy little pearl sell perhaps some kind of black and white animal the

1204
02:50:44,299 --> 02:50:49,020
ownership of which violates international treaties zebra perhaps the most delicious

1205
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:54,700
apples this side of mar de blanc perhaps one of those books father says i'm too young to read

1295
03:08:40,739 --> 03:08:48,649
i really don't want to sell this but i don't want to buy this oh we both can agree on that

1296
03:08:49,209 --> 03:09:04,569
oh that's pretty good deal 50 off the necklace

1297
03:09:09,239 --> 03:09:13,719
it's a bit expensive yeah you're right 125 1250

1298
03:09:13,719 --> 03:09:17,299
week

1299
03:09:20,379 --> 03:09:20,940
everybody else

1300
03:09:23,590 --> 03:09:47,959
cherries 1200 just a little bit less 1179 what am i saying chewy minus 60 it's all right i but

1301
03:09:47,959 --> 03:10:02,489
i have that i spent like 16 or 17 thousand dollars news the price of candy has increased

1302
03:10:03,129 --> 03:10:12,729
the price of candy do i have candy oh that was a news flash important events are reported for

1303
03:10:12,729 --> 03:10:25,260
everyone in the city it's the twix brothers their stunt was a success all right uh that one

1304
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:30,040
was a sudden jump in candy prices you're buying or selling candy pay close attention

1305
03:10:33,190 --> 03:10:37,750
sudden scarcity has driven the price of candy up in general that means that prices will

1306
03:10:37,750 --> 03:10:44,920
roughly double because like all the twix guys did the stunt yeah and the guy with the magic

1307
03:10:44,920 --> 03:11:01,319
wand i'm telling you he deleted all their capes finally my friend candy that sell for 300 may

1308
03:11:01,319 --> 03:11:10,809
now sell for 600 i'll buy all the candy in the city and keep it for myself maybe i'll share

1309
03:11:10,809 --> 03:11:16,569
or sell a little but it is candy ahem no prices will stabilize after some time

1310
03:11:17,829 --> 03:11:23,639
nobody can say for how long for once however you have hit upon a good point while it can be hard

1311
03:11:23,639 --> 03:11:28,440
to predict price fluctuations if you keep a fairly wide variety of stock handy it's possible

1312
03:11:28,440 --> 03:11:34,260
to take advantage of a situation like this and make money you can also try to take the

1313
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:39,059
advantage of the situation after news comes in of course but it's harder to really make

1314
03:11:39,059 --> 03:11:46,420
a profit that way it's complicated i'm hungry it's really not that hard of a concept to

1315
03:11:46,420 --> 03:11:58,100
understand ah the news again watch carefully this information could be vital louis the swordsman

1316
03:11:58,659 --> 03:12:14,520
bounced check at local cafe now on the lamb louis doesn't have any money that's vital news

1317
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:25,379
imagine if you turned on the news and they just talked about how

1318
03:12:26,260 --> 03:12:34,389
some random person couldn't pay for something i'll tell you though if that's your news

1319
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:47,879
things are probably going pretty well wherever you are free louis oh wait wait wait come here

1320
03:12:49,879 --> 03:12:56,219
store atmosphere uh-oh we're getting we're getting a little bit more further to the

04:17:10,020 --> 04:17:36,700

04:18:32,120 --> 04:18:43,719
today too capitalism ho what's that girl doing outside the shop she's out just kind

1636
04:18:43,799 --> 04:18:56,229
of staring into the shop and she has a tattoo on her head okay does she want to come inside maybe

1637
04:18:56,229 --> 04:19:08,540
or are windows that gripping well smile receipt come on smile look friendly i just imagine a

1638
04:19:08,540 --> 04:19:16,469
forced teeth smile okay what should i do here call police please tell me you have not reached

1639
04:19:16,469 --> 04:19:22,280
the point where your face is frozen in a vapid smile for all eternity there's a girl

1640
04:19:22,920 --> 04:19:30,620
curious about the inside and she's looking scanning the items yeah we got a neighborhood

1641
04:19:30,620 --> 04:19:38,840
watch down here i'll just come and arrest you the shop so i try to give her my best come in

1642
04:19:38,840 --> 04:20:01,799
and buy lots of stuff smile she's not there anymore citizens of rest so i am terrifying you

1643
04:20:01,799 --> 04:20:11,059
say really terrifying is that smile you think yeah you're a terror can we just stop staring

1644
04:20:11,139 --> 04:20:30,420
at each other what did i do wrong now given how well you're doing i think it's time i

1645
04:20:30,420 --> 04:20:38,090
explained how to take an order in advance customers have simply put purchasing items

1646
04:20:38,090 --> 04:20:41,610
from us immediately with an advanced order however a customer will let us know what they

1647
04:20:41,610 --> 04:20:50,280
want and return in a set number of days to pick up the items obviously not every customer

1648
04:20:50,280 --> 04:20:53,399
will want to do this but if a customer tells you that they want something in so many days

1649
04:20:54,200 --> 04:21:08,389
it's an advanced order okay so i have to make sure i have it here it's pre-orders if they

1650
04:21:08,389 --> 04:21:11,989
simply wanted the items now they would purchase the items now the date is based on what is

1651
04:21:11,989 --> 04:21:17,430
convenient for the customer not you so if they want an item and say three days you must give

1652
04:21:17,430 --> 04:21:23,829
it to them then and remember we must be open to actually sell an item to someone so make

1653
04:21:23,829 --> 04:21:33,059
sure the store is open that day or we cannot fill the order okay it's too complex no i get

1654
04:21:33,059 --> 04:21:37,299
i understand this works people use advanced orders to purchase multiple items at once

1655
04:21:37,299 --> 04:21:44,629
it is an excellent chance to sell many items in one go try to fill as many as you can see

1656
04:21:45,270 --> 04:22:03,110
she said it was complicated i said it was fun all right let's go let's get rid of this actually

1657
04:22:03,110 --> 04:22:08,950
no i'm gonna hold on to the food there's gonna be a food surge i just know it somebody will

1658
04:22:08,950 --> 04:22:25,879
buy this fucking dumb necklace eventually get it in the window so how much am i how much do i owe

1659
04:22:26,809 --> 04:22:29,850
80 000 next week i knew it was gonna be hovering around there somewhere

1660
04:22:29,850 --> 04:22:41,940
there's a lot that is a lot okay i'm gonna i think i'm gonna go adventure

1661
04:22:45,719 --> 04:23:05,530
i think it's time to go down steel sword anything else i can take here

1662
04:23:07,540 --> 04:23:10,899
uh i could take some just the bread just in case you need i need to eat it

1663
04:23:17,020 --> 04:23:28,260
that's good so now we're gonna go to floor 11 to 15 so what's other equip items yes

1664
04:23:28,260 --> 04:23:33,620
so i'm looking for the

1665
04:23:34,739 --> 04:23:41,959
play-doh snake things i need like five of those play-doh green play-doh snake thingies

1666
04:23:56,260 --> 04:24:04,729
what what all right i just noticed somebody linked the total and immediately a bunch of

1667
04:24:04,729 --> 04:24:11,129
manipulators just did i didn't even do anything see that manipulation in real time that's market

1668
04:24:11,129 --> 04:24:34,389
manipulation you motherfuckers can go into jail for that this game is pretty fun i like this game

1669
04:24:45,239 --> 04:25:01,559
do i get to have anybody else besides louis tell me if i miss any items no go back around

1670
04:25:01,559 --> 04:25:05,340
this way

1671
04:25:07,500 --> 04:25:11,100
i mean i guess you know i i could just go down as fast as i possibly can

1672
04:25:12,540 --> 04:25:15,340
to try boots leather boots

1673
04:25:21,030 --> 04:25:24,389
don't be so stupid here

1674
04:25:30,950 --> 04:25:32,149
okay i thought that was an npc

1675
04:25:42,329 --> 04:25:50,059
oops can i block is there a way to hold the shield up i guess not

1676
04:25:58,709 --> 04:26:06,940
you have to parry well that would be shocking oh you auto block from the front okay that's

1677
04:26:06,940 --> 04:26:10,620
good enough

1678
04:26:19,260 --> 04:26:20,379
stupid rocks

1679
04:26:25,819 --> 04:26:38,709
uh kind of an odd random encounter yeah that was that actually you're right that was a sharp

1680
04:26:38,709 --> 04:26:46,520
nato all right don't get sloppy here because i don't have a way to heal i have to level up

1681
04:26:46,520 --> 04:26:56,700
the heal or eat the bread and i brought one bread all right i'm gonna have to eat it

1682
04:27:03,450 --> 04:27:05,610
no i i think i could probably level up before that

1683
04:27:12,440 --> 04:27:21,750
more bread really no play-doh snake things

1684
04:27:21,750 --> 04:27:25,110

1712
04:33:05,380 --> 04:33:22,520
tricky poll here there's one other ice cream that i think i've ever had that reaction to

1713
04:33:23,909 --> 04:33:30,470
and i don't agree with it anymore my opinion has changed um the birthday cake ice cream from

1714

cold stone used to be it was just i couldn't handle it it was too good i need to get rid

1719
04:34:08,650 --> 04:34:15,020
cream i've ever had in my life i would call that a very substantially good ice cream

1720
04:34:18,869 --> 04:34:22,220
all right 14 almost at 15 getting there

1721
04:34:26,700 --> 04:34:29,740

1745
04:37:28,299 --> 04:37:31,110

04:37:37,349 --> 04:37:38,389
no i don't want the toupee

1747
04:37:41,220 --> 04:37:49,299
mom's making cookies the name sucks it should look like it's making cookies all right you have

1748
04:37:49,299 --> 04:37:57,209
me there mom's making cookies with you know making cookies not making it's mom's making

1749
04:37:57,209 --> 04:38:01,669
cookies no just making just making cookies

1750
04:38:09,180 --> 04:38:13,590
see that's people see the name and they go all right that sounds like

1751
04:38:13,590 --> 04:38:30,419
shit that's a gimmick damn it i was trying to go this way i missed twice

1752
04:38:36,549 --> 04:38:40,630
can i review it i've already just i just reviewed it i just told you it's the best

1753
04:38:40,630 --> 04:38:44,950
ice cream i've ever had and i told you what was in it what else is for me to review

1754
04:38:45,750 --> 04:38:59,259
do it while eating it you're i already know what it tastes like uh oh this is the lowest floor of

1755
04:38:59,259 --> 04:39:03,849
the dungeon not precisely while we cannot currently proceed any further i strongly

1756
04:39:03,849 --> 04:39:10,490
suspect that we can go even deeper next time am i getting hard locked out because i was doing

1757
04:39:10,490 --> 04:39:18,259
too well the dungeons change shape every time someone enters them some theorize that they

1758
04:39:18,259 --> 04:39:23,080
adapt the strength of those who enter that is what happened and refer to it as the living

1759
04:39:23,080 --> 04:39:30,680
dungeon phenomenon okay so what's in the chest i wonder if the dungeon gets bored if it's alone

1760
04:39:33,750 --> 04:39:37,830
so that would make the people who are foolish enough to enter a place like this to play things

1761
04:39:37,830 --> 04:39:47,740
of the underworld hey i see i like the way you'd think girl who's there it's me no it's

1762
04:39:47,740 --> 04:40:00,520
it's me even names charms the lady thief thief thief so your treasure is valuables and

1763
04:40:00,520 --> 04:40:08,979
assorted shiny bits i'll be taking them if you please we won't let you always the way

1764
04:40:09,779 --> 04:40:13,459
well then in that case looks like it's time to cut some fools

1765
04:40:23,700 --> 04:40:29,209

wish just looking at the fountain kind of makes me want to can i make the natural assumption

1998
05:29:08,439 --> 05:29:13,080
that you have been so abysmally foolish in the past is to actually throw perfectly valid

2031
05:36:31,290 --> 05:36:34,729
out of the house on days like this walking in the sun like this is good for the soul

2032
05:36:35,849 --> 05:36:39,130
clear days do feel nice you stay indoors during periods of an inclement weather then

2033
05:36:40,330 --> 05:36:43,369
i know sun's good for the soul but rain hardens the body

2034
05:36:44,090 --> 05:36:50,599
sides it's nice to see the city looking different on a rainy day so then you just

2035

2038
05:37:11,860 --> 05:37:16,900
me as the pious type when you came to the chapel you'd get a stamp on a little card

2039
05:37:17,939 --> 05:37:23,459
with enough stamps you get a piece of candy so your primary motivation was the candy not the

2040
05:37:23,459 --> 05:37:33,479
fake yep oh my goodness by previous judgment hit the sweet spot it seems so just don't

where's my fucking mouse it's under the desk that was what fell down earlier i got it i got

2190
06:06:36,409 --> 06:06:49,529

2191
06:06:56,139 --> 06:06:56,619
get them all

2192
06:07:03,819 --> 06:07:09,740
bugs damn it they usually drop the um thing i'm looking for

2193
06:07:11,259 --> 06:07:14,650
now nobody wants a common wooden shield nobody wants that

2194
06:07:17,130 --> 06:07:22,490
yeah 16

2195
06:07:29,270 --> 06:07:30,150
those sell for a lot

2196
06:07:39,299 --> 06:07:46,009
so is it it's a percentage chance to just drop from the slime boss so i need to just

2197
06:07:46,009 --> 06:07:55,209
do the slime boss over and over again is this monster hunter

2198
06:08:01,259 --> 06:08:09,819
oh that's a nice helmet warrior's helmet

2199
06:08:17,819 --> 06:08:24,229
bring back the cursor it's not coming back hey i'll come back tomorrow when i play this tomorrow

2200
06:08:24,229 --> 06:08:36,599
you'll see it i'm kind of addicted to this game it's such a simple concept but it's it's

2201
06:08:36,599 --> 06:08:37,400
fun

2202
06:08:42,380 --> 06:08:45,659
nice to get all the bugs yes all right i need one more of these

2203
06:08:48,759 --> 06:08:51,799
one more of those things and i can cry i confuse the uh

2204
06:08:53,560 --> 06:09:04,659
try moonlighter it's similar i gotta go to a surprise party you gotta stream it again

2205
06:09:04,659 --> 06:09:13,779
after tomorrow we'll see if i'm still addicted and i'm still having fun i don't know we'll

2206
06:09:13,779 --> 06:09:20,490
just do it again moonlighter is kind of bad says lucretius look what do you it's bad

2207
06:09:21,290 --> 06:09:36,139
oh did you just start fighting it's a good game what's wrong with it

2208
06:09:37,900 --> 06:09:46,950
this is the only thing we play now special inkwell i'm getting some treasures here

2209
06:09:47,430 --> 06:09:54,860
but that's just like your opinion man well it's not my opinion i haven't played it

2210
06:09:55,900 --> 06:09:59,180
it could be great could be bad could be awful could be fun i don't know

2211
06:10:02,939 --> 06:10:07,259
forget about the mushrooms although i don't know dude i might need them

2212
06:10:07,259 --> 06:10:10,060
eventually or something up to make a fusion i don't know

2213
06:10:10,060 --> 06:10:17,099
oh

2214
06:10:18,540 --> 06:10:27,130
in the top recedar stream worldwide it's probably because i'm the only

2215
06:10:27,130 --> 06:10:32,630
recedar stream worldwide that's probably what's going on

2216
06:10:42,979 --> 06:10:46,419
moonlighter has a much less impressive haggle system and the combat is a lot more repetitive

2217
06:10:46,419 --> 06:10:50,500
unfortunately i'd say the game is much more this game is much more fleshed out

2218
06:10:52,099 --> 06:10:56,819
really come on give me one more one more so we can see it ah come on

2364
06:35:06,330 --> 06:35:12,220
suggestions well hold on a minute here this is important did you get the boneless skinless

2365
06:35:12,220 --> 06:35:16,900
sardines by the way there's only one brand you should be purchasing and that's king oscar

2366
06:35:18,250 --> 06:35:27,130
king oscar boneless and seedless seed boneless and skinless sardines in oil boneless and

2367
06:35:27,130 --> 06:35:33,529
skinless sardines in oil king oscar they come in a tin you fold them back put them on smash

2368
06:35:33,529 --> 06:35:37,770
them up put them on a little bit of toast maybe add a little bit of mayonnaise to that

2369
06:35:37,770 --> 06:35:50,470
or a tomato on top you may have you may have not have eaten them correctly king oscar

2370
06:35:50,470 --> 06:35:56,279
they're the best i don't look i don't do sponsorships i just tell you the truth

2371
06:35:56,279 --> 06:36:05,400
about what i believe king oscar sardines are the best baskin robin's mom's cookies ice cream

2372
06:36:05,400 --> 06:36:09,000
is the best you don't have to pay me to say that i'm just i'm telling you a fact

2373
06:36:13,450 --> 06:36:17,450
king oscar doesn't have to come here and give me a thousand dollars to do an anime

2374
06:36:17,450 --> 06:36:33,139
voice i'm just gonna speak facts why would he sponsor after 2 000 people just left anyway

2375
06:36:33,139 --> 06:36:38,860
well this is the end of the spring if i had a sponsorship i would have been probably required

2376
06:36:38,860 --> 06:36:51,139
to do it peak viewership anyways sardines are really good another boomer food that you should

2377
06:36:51,139 --> 06:37:01,400
try uh let me think about this it's just food it's not boomer food canned fish is really

2378
06:37:01,400 --> 06:37:05,000
good for you and it's really tastes good as long as you do it right canned tuna canned

2379
06:37:05,000 --> 06:37:13,849
sardines anchovies they are good if you can just get over it how weird and strange and

2380
06:37:13,849 --> 06:37:31,139
gross television has told you they are you're gonna enjoy them canned tuna is great did it try

2381
06:37:31,139 --> 06:37:41,130
pasta with uh pasta casserole uh what uh pasta with tuna no tuna casserole and pasta casserole

2382
06:37:41,130 --> 06:37:53,450
i'm a fucking idiot tuna casserole is a really good boomer food look it up but thank you for

2383
06:37:53,450 --> 06:37:59,380
the 250 hope you can retry sardines when you get the right brand snooze and cough

2384
06:37:59,459 --> 06:38:02,340
thanks for the 250 hey germ i'm really looking forward to today's stream i haven't checked what

2385
06:38:02,340 --> 06:38:06,099
you're playing yet mainly because i can always trust you to choose a fun game and thanks to

2386
06:38:06,099 --> 06:38:11,540
your no anime game policy we don't have to watch stuff like that either i'm so proud of you

2387
06:38:11,540 --> 06:38:15,939
that you never break your policy that is what makes you so great and unique in my eyes

2388
06:38:15,939 --> 06:38:20,020
germa you're the best you never disappoint never that said i'm gonna open the stream

2389
06:38:20,020 --> 06:38:26,150
now i'm really excited you never fail us when did i ever say a no anime game policy

2390
06:38:26,950 --> 06:38:36,740
i've never had a no anime game policy before i said i watch one anime a year this is not an anime

2391
06:38:41,900 --> 06:38:46,220
i did not say that somebody can go find that if they really want to i never said there is a

2392
06:38:46,220 --> 06:38:57,610
no anime game policy on this stream was that some way for me to deflect not having to play

2393
06:38:57,610 --> 06:39:04,259
doki doki literature club because i got asked that every single day every moment of every

2394
06:39:04,259 --> 06:39:16,200
stream i think play doki doki literature club may have been in this chat more than germa moon

2395
06:39:16,759 --> 06:39:27,380
or more than half of my emotes for a period there i had to deflect it somehow you're an actual

2396
06:39:27,380 --> 06:39:34,819
liar i've already told everybody here that 90 80 to 90 percent of everything i say in this

2397
06:39:34,819 --> 06:39:40,340
stream is not real and i always clarify when things are real like for instance

2398
06:39:40,419 --> 06:39:46,659
baskin robbins ice cream is the best that ice cream mom's cookies i said before this is one

2399
06:39:46,659 --> 06:40:06,979
of the 10 things that i say on stream that's real and then i continue to say that sometimes

2400
06:40:06,979 --> 06:40:13,959
it's too easy sometimes it's too easy guys come on but thank you snooze and copter for the

2401
06:40:13,959 --> 06:40:18,360
five dollars they say dot dot dot dot after writing all that so i don't think they were

2402
06:40:18,360 --> 06:40:27,819
uh they may have been a little disappointed chocolate fudge brownie is the best ice cream

2403
06:40:27,819 --> 06:40:39,560
get wrecked jupiter face let's ban this guy real quick oh how do i turn off um

2404

hold on actually just did that what was his name did i even do the right person

2405
06:40:57,770 --> 06:41:16,810
how do you untie about somebody all right there we go there we go i got they say wow

2406
06:41:21,270 --> 06:41:29,689
you banned someone from pointing out the truth i already i unbanned him i had banned

2407
06:41:29,849 --> 06:41:36,279
it wasn't even banned i do it was a small time out of 10 minutes but if you're going to say

2408
06:41:36,279 --> 06:41:42,919
something so so awful like chocolate fudge brownies better than moms making cookies

2409
06:41:42,919 --> 06:41:48,860
i feel like you've gotta go for at least enough for me to not have to look at it

2410
06:41:59,060 --> 06:42:05,340
anyways anyways anyways thank you to uh abomination zero for the five dollars thank

2411

2412
06:42:08,299 --> 06:42:13,979
streaming myself make it look like so much fun how the hell do you do it by having fun

2413
06:42:14,700 --> 06:42:25,479
it's important if you cannot reliably enjoy yourself on stream then it's kind of hard for

2414
06:42:25,479 --> 06:42:40,540
other people too as well except when you play mario maker it's one exception but uh good luck

2415
06:42:40,540 --> 06:42:54,540
to you i wish you the best i've been watching since 2011 so you've been doing something right

2416
06:42:56,919 --> 06:43:07,560
um i don't know if that's just up to you though you know if you've been watching for that long

2417
06:43:08,119 --> 06:43:13,209
then i hope you do think i'm doing something right but there i mean there are plenty of people

2418
06:43:13,209 --> 06:43:17,849
that have watched in come and gone and and that's fine too there may be people that

2419
06:43:17,849 --> 06:43:21,560
have come to this channel and said i don't really like this and left you kind of just

2420
06:43:21,560 --> 06:43:35,290

2421
06:43:36,250 --> 06:43:49,049
no i can't like time that i'm not going to do that this streamer only makes loud noises

2422
06:43:50,729 --> 06:43:56,810
it's been seven hours okay i probably made like 12 loud noises so it was like 18 to 20 seconds

2423
06:43:56,810 --> 06:44:02,250
of loud noises in seven hours that is less than like a quarter of a percent of loud noise time

2435
06:45:50,119 --> 06:45:54,840
screen here and a couple of new things to listen to music wise while blordow continues to

2436
06:45:55,799 --> 06:45:59,959
chip away at all the new stuff i'll probably implementing that over the next couple of streams

2437
06:46:00,919 --> 06:46:09,849
it might take um like into next week but you should see it really soon and the credits

2440
06:46:27,500 --> 06:46:31,979

2441
06:46:34,099 --> 06:46:39,299
three two or three hours ago i believe we may have lost the first two or three hours of

2442
06:46:39,299 --> 06:46:46,779
people that have subscribed in the first couple hours so i'm sorry to say that because technically

2443
06:46:46,779 --> 06:46:52,299
a new stream had to start because i'm not even sure that was a cox thing i think that was a

2444
06:46:52,299 --> 06:47:09,509
twitch thing but regardless thank you everybody for something there's a lot of you old bits
