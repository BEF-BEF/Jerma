00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:12,220
Hi, welcome everyone. How are you? Welcome to another day playing video games and streaming it.

2
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:24,859
A little early today, yeah. Well, technically early. I did say I wanted to start around 1 or 2.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:33,060
It's like 1.30, 1.40, somewhere in the middle there. You just started going to the bathroom.

4
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:45,700
Thanks for telling us. Hey, speaking of the bathroom, uh, I didn't even tell pre-stream chat

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:59,259
this because I was waiting. I dropped my phone in the toilet when it was very dark at night.

6
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,219
This was way worse than the April Fool's video. And it sucks because I got a new phone. But it's

7
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:16,409
fine. There's nothing wrong with it. Let me explain. So, you know when you get up to go

8
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,409
to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Or if you wake up really early and it's still...

9
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,680
How many guys have woken up? I have to go pee in the middle of the night. Sometimes, right?

10
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:32,280
It doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes it does. Like, you drink like a shitload of water

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,840
before you go to bed and you're like, oh wow, I shouldn't have done that. I know I'm gonna have

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:43,129
to go pee later. Anyways, I had to go pee and it's like, it's pitch black. There's no real...

13
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:51,340
There's a little light in my bedroom. That's it. So, I did what every normal, sane human does.

14
00:01:51,900 --> 00:02:00,730
I grabbed my phone and I used the light on the phone to go to the bathroom because I don't want

15
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:09,479
a big bright light in my face. Ah, my eyes! So, you might be misconstruing what I'm talking about

16
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,229
here. I'm not talking about the flashlight on the phone. I'm talking about the home screen.

17
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:24,060
Like, the home screen is bright, is horrible. So, I'm aiming the home... I go into the bathroom

18
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:32,379
and I'm aiming the home screen into the toilet bowl so I can pee into the toilet. So, I can see

19
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:40,460
and it's not bright enough where it's gonna hurt me. And like most people, I have my home screen

20
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:47,400
to just auto turn off after like 10 seconds of being on. So, you get to this weird, like,

21
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,360
goose chase where you've pulled your home screen down to go to the bathroom

22
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,240
and it turns off and it's pitch black again. You're like, oh shit, I gotta fight. Turn it back on.

23
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:06,300
Well, while I was holding it down with the home screen, I remember I'm mid-piss. I'm peeing

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,319
it's mid-piss. It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss. 10 seconds into the full piss.

25
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,740
I drop it right, right, and I'm pissing on the phone. I'm pissing on the phone and it's in piss

26
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:23,860
water into the toilet, peeing on it. And I can't stop pissing. I can't stop it. You cannot turn it

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,879
off. So, I am just pissing all over my new iPhone and I just, I've reached into the toilet and I

28
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,080
pulled it out and I was like, oh shit, no, no, no, no, no, no. But I still have to pee. So, I'm sitting

29
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,860
there holding, I'm peeing into the toilet and I'm holding this pee phone and I don't know what,

30
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:51,560
I didn't know what to do. So finally, like, I finish peeing and then I scramble to, I put the

31
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,680
phone down on the little, on the sink and I'm like, I was like, I was running around, I was like a

32
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,400
Scooby-Doo chase. I didn't know what to do. I'm like running from room to room. Should I use a

33
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,560
towel? No, that's disgusting. Should I, paper towels? Oh, do I put it on ice? Do I put it on

34
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,879
rice? Oh, so I just started wiping it down. I got paper towels, got it. It was dry, right? Completely

35
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:16,360
dry. Took it out of the case. Dry, dry, dry, dry, dry. I looked into the inside of the little,

36
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,290
the hole where you plug in the lightning thing. It's an iPhone. And that was dry too. And I was

37
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:29,500
fine. There's no damage to the phone at all. Zero. And I mean absolutely zero. Yes, I washed. Yes,

38
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,790
I washed it. Of course I did. So, let me just tell you that the, the new iPhones apparently

39
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:44,250
can be pissed on and dropped in your toilet for at least three to four seconds. I am not

40
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,990
kidding. This act, this is, this is a real fucking story. This happened. There's nothing wrong with

41
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:58,490
this phone. It is perfectly fine. Yes, I have pissed on my phone for more than a few seconds.

42
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:15,050
They are waterproof. No, they're not. It works for now. No, it, it works. There's nothing wrong with

43
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,920
it. Guys, I've had water damage on my phones before and you get that weird gray line of the

44
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,199
gray spots that just take over and they just sit there forever. No, this thing is completely fine.

45
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:33,160
What does it smell like? Guys, I didn't like, I didn't drop it in the toilet and piss on it and

46
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,029
then like take it out and dry it and put it in my pocket. I washed this phone. I scrubbed it. I

47
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:45,480
wouldn't, I scrubbed it with soap. I kind of did scrub it with soap and water. I like, I like washed

48
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:56,500
my hands with my phone in my hands. It still works. I didn't, no, that's not completely accurate.

49
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:02,860
I like did enough water where I could like on top of the phone with a little soap and like alcohol

50
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,860
and I didn't, I'm kidding. But I am not kidding when I say that this one, that this one could plunk

51
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,300
underwater and pissed on for at least three to four seconds. And it does nothing wrong with it.

52
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,199
It's fine. None of that is embellished and none of it's made up at all. That is a 100% true story.

53
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Show the phone, show the toilet. You need to bleach it. I've, I alcohol,

54
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:39,540
but isopropyl alcohol is not good enough. Isopropyl alcohol, it kills everything.

55
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,579
Show your microwave. Microwave.

56
00:06:50,139 --> 00:07:06,860
Piss on it again. It's still one percent. Yeah, you know, there might be,

57
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:12,040
it might be 1% piss somewhere in this phone. I don't know. It's probably dried up by now.

58
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,990
Piss in your microwave. All right, we're going to move on. So I had to tell you that story because,

59
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,790
you know, you guys like, oh, I didn't even tweet this stream out. What the?

60
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll play in Hades again tonight. I really like it. It's really fun.

61
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:38,060
And I'm going to see how far I get, see if I can beat it. Tweet out the pee story.

62
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,750
No, I don't tweet. I do tweet. I tweet, but then I hit go to drafts because I don't care.

63
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:53,339
So I tweet to myself every time I have a tweet that I'm like, you know what? Here we go. I'm

64
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:57,740
going to make a tweet. Save to drafts. Yeah, that's a good one. I don't care though. I don't want to

65
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:06,759
have nobody to see that. All right. Let me, let me prove to you. Let me, okay. I'm going to read

66
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:14,259
you one of my drafts. Uh, and then sometimes the tweets that I come up with, I just say at a stream

67
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:20,420
the next day, for instance, holy shit. Parents sit your kids in front of Sesame street. Do not

68
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,339
let them touch the fucking bath salt kids channels where they narrate over the Sims pretending to

69
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:33,990
talk while eating red, green and blue foods every day. That's a draft from like probably four days

70
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:41,240
ago. Uh, after that, uh, you can probably determine where these tweets came from. Uh, if I hear the

71
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,679
words democratic stronghold one more time, I'm going to eat glass. You could probably dictate

72
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:55,379
where that's from, what, what time period that's from. LOL. Why is Mortal Kombat 11 turning into

73
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:00,580
eighties movie smash brothers? That was a good one. You've heard me say that. Oh, here's a good

74
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,539
one. A sneeze coming on with a mouthful of food is the yellow traffic light of eating.

75
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:16,820
Like that one. Didn't send it out though. Oh, here's one. Serving sizes always make me laugh

76
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,820
about three cookies, 12 chips, et cetera. Why don't they be realistic? Eat out of this bag until your

77
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:39,929
stomach hurts. There's more. Tweet all these out. Do you tweet? No, those are, those are tweets for

78
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:47,659
me. Those are my tweets. Those are my, those are tweets for me. That's pretty good. Stand up. Yeah.

79
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:52,620
My drafts are just me writing down like future jokes that I'm going to make on stream.

80
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:04,539
It's just a notepad for me. Release the drafts. Like I can't look, I, I, you don't think this

81
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,179
scenario where I'd be like, let me tell you something about eating when you have sneeze

82
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:11,500
coming on. Let me tell you. It's, every time you have a sneeze coming on and you have a mouthful

83
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,220
of food, you got to make a choice. You either eat, eat, eat, eat, eat quick before you sneeze,

84
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,700
or you hold on tight and you'd wait for it to pass and try not to sneeze the food all over yourself.

85
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:28,379
It's, it would have been pretty good. Sneeze the food out. What do you do?

86
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,500
No, I'm serious. What do you do? If you have to sneeze after you take a bite of a sandwich,

87
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,539
do you spit the sandwich out? Do you sneeze the food out? Do you swallow quick before it happens?

88
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:46,299
It's tough. You hold, you hold your nose. You hold on. You sneeze it out. I, I'll tell you,

89
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:53,299
I usually try to swallow it as fast as I can. Well, it depends. And just like a yellow traffic

90
00:10:53,299 --> 00:11:00,580
light. Where are you? Have you chewed four or five times? Did you just take the bite? What happened?

91
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,919
How far, how close are you to swallowing it? That's virally important for you to know.

92
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:17,340
I close my eyes. You cover your mouth and just like sneeze the food into your hand.

93
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:30,600
It sucks. It's a horrible scenario. Sneeze in your mouth and eat the boogers plus the sandwich.

94
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,559
Okay. Why did I, of all the ones that people were saying, why did I read that one?

95
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,659
You guys are disgusting. You guys are disgusting. Where do you get it from?

96
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,570
I just went on like a five minute talk about how I pissed on my phone in the, in the bathroom.

97
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,950
Where do you guys get this from? You're ridiculous. You guys need to settle down.

98
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,649
All right. Let's, uh, we're gonna play Hades. I'm into it. I love it. It's a 92 right now.

99
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:12,870
We'll see where it ends up at the end of the stream. We'll see. This is a contender for

100
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,720
nastiest stream. There's no category for nastiest stream. It's obviously $50.

101
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:29,110
Zurich Doug gave 5,000 bits. Gave it a lot of money recently. Thanks for the 50 bucks. 50, 50,

102
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,100
five zero. My favorite streamer playing one of my favorite games. I can't watch the whole stream

103
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:47,129
live, but I hope you enjoy yourself. I love it. Hades fucking sucks. Um, I, I, uh, I, look,

104
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:55,690
you need to relax. Okay. Let me get back in this. Let me, how many would I have? Two, three. Should

105
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:07,700
we ban people for their opinions that I don't like? I don't like doing that though. Oh, audio. Yeah.

106
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,659
No, I don't like doing that. If somebody has opinion that I think I don't like, what do you

107
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:15,480
want me to say? You're not allowed, you're no longer allowed to hang out here. Get out of here.

108
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,169
No, I'm going to publicly ridicule, ridicule me instead. I just fucked up the word ridicule. All

109
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:30,490
right. I want, I want money. If you don't know what Hades is, it's a rogue like shooter action

110
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:43,370
RPG, top down strategy game. All right. I'm good. I remember the deal with the traps. Oh, no, no,

111
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:52,950
no. I may, I made sure to play over that. I want money. You just, you just tubered yourself.

112
00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,139
How does one tuber themself? I forget what I don't know. What am I? Oh yeah. I'm doing the

113
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:13,500
ice mode. I'm doing ice guy ice guy. Right. Come on. I get that right. I was my quote medical

114
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,179
appointment. Oh, let's talk about that really quickly. Okay. This would be the probably the

115
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,860
last time I talk about medical stuff unless something major comes up, but here you go.

116
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:28,139
Here's what has been concluded over various doctors, medical professionals, medical personnel.

117
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:33,960
I have two discs in my spine that are black. They're dark. And that means that they're

118
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:42,539
degenerating. So I have essentially the onset of some disc degeneration and it's mild enough

119
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:48,200
for it's manageable. It's not going to, it's not a bad thing. It's actually good to know.

120
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,039
And the muscle tissue around my spine is not having a good time. On top of that,

121
00:14:54,039 --> 00:15:01,210
I also have a hiatal hernia, which may have been causing this kind of chest problems. So I,

122
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,950
the doctors think I'm getting combo'd essentially where I might have, it's the couple of discs in

123
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:13,509
my back that are kind of slowly degenerating and this little hernia that's in my chest and the

124
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:18,309
muscle tissue and the fiber are kind of fucked up around the spine. So I might have like three

125
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,659
different like combo attack on me. So what we're going to do is over the next few weeks, I'm going

126
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:30,059
to be getting trigger point injections, which is they go into the painful points of my back and

127
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:40,230
spine area and they try to shut it up. So that's step one. If that helps, if that really goes away

128
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:49,460
and it really has a huge effect on my, you know, my physical ability, then I'll be good. If it

129
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:58,340
doesn't, and let's say my back pain goes away or it's easier to live with, but my chest problem is

130
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:05,769
still there, then I'm probably going to elect to do a hiatal hernia surgery repair. I'm just going

131
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:11,879
to essentially, I'm going to shotgun blast this and try everything that's possible. But there's

132
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:17,399
your kind of definitive things that people have come up with. There are two or three, the third

133
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:24,019
disc in that area. It's in, it's right in that spot where it hurts too. So I have two shitty discs,

134
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,590
but they're not shitty enough to cause any, it's like, it's not shitty enough to do surgery on.

135
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:35,000
It's not like, oh wow, look at how horrible these are. We're going to do spine surgery now.

136
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,299
It's not there. I just kind of have to do pain management to it because you can't fix it. It

137
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:49,000
really never goes away. I can just get a sort of injections and, you know, the theory was a few

138
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,659
months ago, three or four or five months ago that I would do like an intercostal nerve block just to

139
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:58,789
like shut the pain receptors off because my pain receptors might be going crazy too. So I don't

140
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:06,299
know. We're going to go for it. That was his last break dance. Hey, you don't know that yet. You

141
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:20,180
don't know that yet, but that's sort of where we are now. I appreciate all the, everyone obviously

142
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,210
has been concerned about it. I have been too, but the good thing is almost every single

143
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:34,359
possible thing that could be very major wrong is not wrong. There are a couple of small things

144
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,799
that I still need to keep my eye on over the years. And one of them is I have a prostate problem too,

145
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:44,279
but that's not causing this problem. That's sort of just incidentally, it was like, hey,

146
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,799
you kind of have like a prostate problem, dude. So I do. Yeah. Oh, let's keep an eye on that.

147
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:59,930
Oh, but remember, I have, I have done like, I've probably done like, I've been to the doctor like

148
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:07,190
30 times over the last like six to seven months, realistically, right? So it's like,

149
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:17,420
they're going to incidentally find something. That's a new enemy. Not doing enough zirking off.

150
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:24,779
Okay. Can I even say that? Can I even say what I just said? Am I, is this allowed to talk about

151
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:46,740
that? It's off. Why is it off? Oh, shit. I can't do it. Oh, these guys, these guys here. Here we go.

152
00:18:46,740 --> 00:19:03,289
Oops. Oops. Oh, it bounces around. Right, right, right, right, right. Hi. I donated $15. I demand

153
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:12,470
a face cam. What? No, no face cam. Guys, don't you have, have you figured, has anybody figured

154
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:20,390
this out yet? I only do face cams when I like feel handsome. When I go, I look in the mirror

155
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:31,619
and I'm like, oh, I got, ooh, look at this guy today. Let's go. Face cam. You know, most of the

156
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:38,099
time I look at the mirror and it's like, ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We don't need to see that

157
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:45,829
today. And plus that's a good excuse because I'm, I'm naked. I don't have a shirt on. I'm bare,

158
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,359
bare chest right now. You should always feel handsome. No, I don't. Look, I have confidence.

159
00:19:52,359 --> 00:20:18,380
I do. Uh, I think I want Hermes. Oh, couple cats. Why are they cats? Show your prostate.

160
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:31,619
Hey, take a look guys. Like, like an X-ray, like a MRI of my prostate. Why would you want to see

161
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:37,000
that? Oh, I forgot about my skeleton photo. I have to get a, I have to get a copy of that.

162
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:49,029
It is. Ooh, attack speed or movement speed? Probably attack speed, right?

163
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:06,500
I would say one. How much faster is 10%? I mean, it's not making the charge faster though. That's

164
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:15,339
what I care about, but I can still, it's still cool. That's your special, not attack. Is it?

165
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:30,950
Huh. Hermes sans reveal. Uh, another $50 comes in from Zurich. That's a hundred bucks on the,

166
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,150
in the 30 minutes, the 20 minutes I've been streaming. Also, I won some money so I can shout

167
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:46,390
our handsome streamer, Jerma's special meal from Maccas. Maccas. McDonald's? You won some money.

168
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:59,589
Well, I hope, I hope you got a lot. That's a, oh, that's a restaurant in Australia.

169
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:18,619
Maccas? Oh, it's not McDonald's? It is. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. All right. You cast,

170
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:25,109
all right. Any effects are more potent. I cast right now is the, isn't it the lightning beam

171
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:30,980
thing? The cast fires longer and inflicts chill. Actually that's probably, that's probably much

172
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:40,740
better. I like this too though. I'm getting a casting. I haven't even done it. McDonald's

173
00:22:40,740 --> 00:23:05,450
officially changed its name to Maccas in Australia. Why? What? Maccas? The cast is unbelievable,

174
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:23,430
by the way. Who's shooting all this? Oh, it's these dickheads. What? Oh, it's cause the thing,

175
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,380
all right, the thing he's shooting is blue. It's like, wait, what is happening? What is the

176
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:49,160
little blue shit shooting from the sides? Oh, that's Poseidon doing that. Dick. Hey, JPQ plays.

177
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:55,579
Thanks for the five community subs. You deal more damage when slamming foes into barriers.

178
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:07,140
Call polls in foes and effect, holy shit, that's much better. You poll people in? All right,

179
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:15,579
that's really good. I don't want to sell anything. I want to buy things. Poseidon's literally the

180
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:26,539
biggest asshole in all of Olympus. I don't know much of the lore. Ooh, all right, I got 294.

181
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:41,000
That's enough for Dionysius, Travis Scott meal, and can I get them all? Oh, a bunch of you guys

182
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,180
weren't here yesterday. That's like, that's just what we call this. No, no, that's just what we

183
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,940
call this. Okay, those of you guys that weren't here yesterday, that's just what we've been

184
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:58,329
calling that. That's not like, oh, I'm making like a joke today. No, this is what we call that meal.

185
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:10,069
Oh shit, it's okay. It's a, this is a boss fight. I need to heal. I need, I have to heal and extra

186
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:27,480
health or heal and Dionysius. Maybe I'll do the heart. Yeah. All right, let's kick some ass.

187
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:38,819
I remember this fight being very difficult. Run is literally over. It might be. These guys are hard.

188
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,660
This, these guys are crazy.

189
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,490
Even though I was outnumbered. Take the wrestling belt.

190
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:08,579
How was your date last night? I went to, I didn't go to, I was out of medical

191
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:19,589
professional's office. That's not a date. That's the sound it makes? One, two, three, action.

192
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:57,609
What the fuck did you just say? Whoa, I forgot. He ain't got shit. Well, these guys have a lot of

193
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:43,539
health. I forgot. It's time for father's call. He's blocking it. Oh shit. I stood still. What

194
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:57,349
happened? Oh, this is when Aphrodite comes in. Run into something already. Oh, that hurt. Father's

195
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:57,589
blessing. I thought there was an enemy. Shit. Get in there. No. Way to go. Father's call.

196
00:28:58,150 --> 00:30:05,059
What? Oops. Father's call. Run into something. All right, let's go. Way to go. Oh, that's a lot

197
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:35,930
longer than I thought it was. Charge. Oh, he's getting close. Okay, we're good. Run into

198
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:43,940
something, please. We're good. Good thing I had that father's call. It's your uncle. It's your,

199
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:56,329
well, whatever. I'm just like every character in Marvel versus Capcom. I'm just doing all kinds of

200
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:05,980
moves and then when I do my special, I just say the thing that it is. That's a Marvel versus

201
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:15,609
Capcom reference. That ain't nothing to do with those other four games. Oh, go to the fan. Yeah.

202
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:27,880
Hi. Look, it's a fan. How come I only have one fan if I've done this twice? Don't they know

203
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:41,240
already? Does the agreement carry over? Yeah, because I haven't paid up yet. 145. Oh, that's

204
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:48,819
right. I get full healed from all the fountains now. I forgot about that. That's not a fan.

205
00:31:49,460 --> 00:32:02,710
What would you call it? Give me it. What do I get? What do I get? Perhaps deal 500% damage to foes.

206
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,700
Another $50. Five thousand more bits. You guys are crazy. Why are you giving me this much money

207
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:21,420
today? This is from Ishanji. Another $50 bit drop. They say bounty claimed. New prostate funds.

208
00:32:23,829 --> 00:32:32,519
Thank you. Thanks. Bounty claimed. When are I going to play Demon's Souls?

209
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:43,480
Uh, when I get a PS5 maybe. Whenever that is. Oh, also I saw the sad news. Real sad news, guys.

210
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:53,750
Hitman 3 has the complete VR mode, right? Oh, that's so cool. It's only PSVR. And you can only play

211
00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:08,460
it on the PS4 version of the game. What the hell? That's horrible. The PS5 version? You can't play

212
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:16,359
it on the PS5 version? Why can't you? Please tell me they're going to put that for, you know,

213
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:25,400
like the Vive and the Index and stuff, right? It's such a wasted opportunity. POV, your Jerma's

214
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:35,799
phone. There's one thing wrong with this image. It is the fact that this person is wearing,

215
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:53,880
uh, like cocky shorts. Do not wear, I don't wear cocky shorts. I wasn't even sad about it,

216
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:06,619
though. I was just panicking. Cocky. Pax, whatever. I'm not from the part of the world that you're

217
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:24,489
from. We talk differently. No one says it like that. I'm originally from Massachusetts, from

218
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:35,349
Boston. I'm from Boston. I'm from Boston. Sorry, that was really loud. This is it, man. We're here.

219
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:50,579
I'm here. Can I do this? Am I going to be able to do this shit? Let's go. Probably not. All right,

220
00:34:50,579 --> 00:35:05,460
we got to save money because I, I want, okay, what do I want? Definitely the health. Let's see

221
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:16,710
what's in here. What do they do? I don't even know what they do. Holy shit in my pants. That's what

222
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:41,500
they do. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Good. We're good. Drink bath water. Drink bath

223
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:58,440
water. What? Just stun lock them. Very cool. All right. Almost got that HP upgrade. Why did I read

224
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:09,750
that? I don't know. Why did I read anything here? He won't raise it. Oh shit. That's shooting blades

225
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:54,619
out of me. Out at me. Out at me. Well, this room sucks. Die. Die. Poison. Poison. Poison. Who's left?

226
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:18,440
Oh my god damn it. I'm fucked. These saw blades, man, are killing me. All right. Good. All right.

227
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:37,800
I'm all right. I'm okay. Can we see you with your, nope. When is house flipper? Oh, well,

228
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,199
tomorrow is going to be chat's choice. There'll be a handful of things to choose from. Maybe it'll

229
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:54,760
be on there. I think I'm just going to buy one of these now. All right. Should I? I don't know what

230
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:16,980
to do. I mean, I feel like my weapon is really good. I'm just going to do the health. Do the health

231
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:25,190
and then I'm going to buy that one too. So what's available? All right. I could do another one of

232
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:55,989
these. Money, right? I could do them all, but it's dangerous. Earn him. I'll get a final upgrade to

233
00:38:55,989 --> 00:39:10,739
this. Oh dude. Germa reference. Shit. I can't sell anything. Just because there's a rat in a video

234
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:35,000
game doesn't mean it's a Germa reference. Yo, Germa. Dude. Rat. Yes, it does. Well, wow. I almost

235
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:47,349
got hit. Give me those. I want these back. Stupid. Wait. No, no. There are no boons worth giving up.

236
00:39:47,349 --> 00:40:03,820
I have a Germa reference infestation. What does that mean? I have a Germa reference infestation.

237
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:17,780
This is interesting. This is interesting. This is interesting. This is interesting.

238
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:32,440
Hold on. Whenever you cast damage foes around you and inflict chill, applying 10 stacks of

239
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:43,670
chill causes a blast. That's definitely what I want. Arctic blast gum. All right. And let's get

240
00:40:43,670 --> 00:41:05,349
this too. I don't think I'm done. I want the money. Three plus your cast equals hog. That's true.

241
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,679
Maybe I should just go kill him. Should I just go for him? Is there a way to see how many revives

242
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:25,460
I have left? Where is that? Do I have two? Oh, bottom left. Okay. I have one revive left.

243
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,900
Shit. Do I go fight this asshole? Or do I try to get enough? I mean, I got full health.

244
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:49,780
Do I go? I'm going to fight him. Let's go. Let's go. I might lose a lot of HP. I have full health

245
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,570
and a revive. I'm going to play smart. All right. Here we go. See if I can beat this

246
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:00,250
motherfucker right now. Come on. Second try on Hades. Let's do it. Come on. I'm going to go for

247
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:17,099
it. Let's go. I'm going to go. I'm going to do it. Quiet. Not you be quiet. Me be quiet. Play smart.

248
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:36,980
Don't play smart. Not hard. Are you winning, son? Yes, dad, I am, if you want to know.

249
00:42:42,199 --> 00:43:59,579
All right. I'm ready. Get it started. Already fucked it up. That hurt. Fuck you, dad.

250
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:07,269
Stop. Stop. What am I doing? Stop. The fucking goblin's taking over.

251
00:45:08,340 --> 00:46:38,409
Where is he? Come on, father. All right. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. I got a full revive.

252
00:46:38,409 --> 00:47:34,730
I got to throw. I'm not throwing. This is the end. It's all right. Bring me back. Bring me back.

253
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:05,449
Holy shit. That was insane. I'm dead. That was fucking insane. The whole entire area just

254
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:18,059
exploded. Every inch of everything was exploded. Second try. I didn't do it. I had to stand on a

255
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:36,969
pillar. Oh, what the fuck? The pillars blocked the laser. Yeah, but the whole area was poisoned.

256
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:42,230
All the ground was poisoned. I fucked it up. All the ground was poisonous. Oh, whatever. That's

257
00:48:42,230 --> 00:49:00,380
attempt number two. I'm going to kill this motherfucker on the third try. That was intense.

258
00:49:04,329 --> 00:49:16,280
I have to unlock the other weapon too. Should I unlock the fourth weapon yet?

259
00:49:24,409 --> 00:49:39,860
I need the spear. I kind of have to use the shield wands, right? What's all this other stuff?

260
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,559
I have like two diamonds, three blood, two super potions. What do I do with these?

261
00:49:46,039 --> 00:50:11,719
Fishing. Wait, what? Scoop creatures from the river? That's an entire diamond. Okay, I got it.

262
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:25,619
So I can fish in the waters? That's kind of crazy. What do you have to say, Nix?

263
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:30,820
I trust that the mirror in your bed chamber has proved satisfactory, dear child.

264
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,750
That I could have possibly imagined, Nix. You mentioned there was something more that it could

265
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:43,739
do once I had grown accustomed. I think I'm ready for that now. I think you are as well.

266
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:53,739
Then it shall be as you wish. Thank you. New talents? Oh shit, I can upgrade more stuff in

267
00:50:53,739 --> 00:51:02,300
the mirror? Hey, the lounge is open. What is this place? What the hell? This is cool. A

268
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:09,699
commemorative ball of the stoicals within the celebrating and proclaiming the accomplishments

269
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:18,039
Meg, it is. I pissed on my phone so I can be like you. People happy.

270
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:25,320
Don't do that. Don't do that. I want to be like you. I peepee on phone.

271
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:55,369
I like the voices. They're good. Who's this? Slimer? Oh, it's Medusa.

272
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:59,559
I just wanted to say, don't bother picking up my room today.

273
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:13,400
I've been out for a while. May the box scrumptious kick. Greetings, chef.

274
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:25,750
There's a chef too? This is so cool. Can I do anything else in here?

275
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:29,590
Why does this guy look like a vendor? Oh, he is. Greetings, broker.

276
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:45,820
Oh, a diamond. This diamond's worth a lot, huh? Okay, I don't think I want to do any of this.

277
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:54,650
How many keys do I have? I have enough keys to unlock the mirror. Very, very cool.

278
00:52:55,289 --> 00:53:05,050
Very nice. Awesome. What else can I do? Check the bottom. The bottom. 200 gemstones

279
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:17,750
for what? That's a lot of gems for just somebody's blood. Don't do it. It's not worth it. No, no,

280
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:31,099
no, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this. But that's a lot of gems. Actually, I don't even

281
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:34,619
know what these things are for. So let's do that. Let's figure out what the blood is for first.

282
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:45,300
Upgraded the mirror, right? Don't listen to the Reddit chat.

283
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,679
Well, they're a Twitch chat. If it was a Reddit chat, I'd be streaming on Reddit, wouldn't I?

284
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:05,289
Okay, hold on. I got a lot of these. Boiling blood. Deal bonus attack and special damage

285
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:10,730
for foes with that in them. And this is Razor Supply. I can do more casts. I think I want that.

286
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:23,880
Check the left. You can switch every trait on the mirror now. Wait, I don't understand.

287
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:36,280
Press A to activate fiery presence instead of shadow presence. What the fuck? All right,

288
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,360
so deal bonus attack and special damage when striking undamaged foes versus people from behind.

289
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:50,019
This is restore some of your health when you collect that. 30% of the amount of the

290
00:54:50,019 --> 00:55:02,309
dark power you collect versus... I think this one's better. Restore 50% of your health when you...

291
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:09,659
Wait a minute. What's this one turn into? Restore 30% instead of dying when your life

292
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:20,730
total is depleted one time per chamber. So you get to die just once total versus once per chamber.

293
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:29,699
That doesn't sound very good. 50% damage and dodge chance for two seconds when you dash

294
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:39,929
right before getting hit versus... You can... No. This one is... You do bonus damage to people that

295
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:44,579
have the diamond in them. And this is reduce movement speed and damage of foes with the

296
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:55,929
diamond in them. I like this one better. This is raising the supply of casts versus regenerate your

297
00:55:55,929 --> 00:56:03,940
cast rather than pick it up. So you don't have to pick it up anymore. I kind of like that more.

298
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:22,699
Wait a minute. So that means I can cast and then four seconds later I can cast again.

299
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:25,739
So I can cast every three... That's awesome. Yeah, I'm gonna keep that.

300
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:37,449
And then I'll upgrade... Let's upgrade this. All right. 30% of all that collected we can keep that

301
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:54,329
on. Your dark regeneration was at 0%. How can I have a reset talents? Reclaim any? Oh, that's cool.

302
00:56:54,329 --> 00:57:09,480
That's really cool. I can get all my talent points back. More dialogue from Skeleton.

303
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,010
That's not a wild reference. There's talent points in other games.

304
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:32,199
You can reset your talent points in like 20 RPGs that are on the market right now.

305
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:54,789
Okay. Spear. The range on this is insane. What? Hold for a spin attack? Skewer and recall?

306
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:15,210
Does it go through them again? It does. Dash strike. Cool. All right. Well, I have to try

307
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:23,239
a run with this. Let's put on the money thing. Wait. I don't want to just be like a like a two

308
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:43,110
trinket loser, right? This gets ranked up. Yeah. Put this on. Oh, I can dash with the charge? Wait.

309
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:57,980
Hold on. That's pretty awesome. That's really awesome. Two trinket Andy. Right.

310
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:16,119
I don't want to be that today. It's not that orderly really. That's a hundred damage. All

311
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:21,849
right. Somebody said I can upgrade the weapons. How do I do that? Have I unlocked the ability

312
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:32,389
to do that yet? You can't do that yet. Oh, all right. I'm going to give the spear a try.

313
00:59:42,840 --> 01:00:06,860
Berries again. Is this doom too? Spoiling Andy. Okay. I can do doom or your cast sends a blade

314
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:15,780
rift. I did. I, yeah. Didn't I specifically upgrade the cast thing? That's pretty cool.

315
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:25,449
One, two, three. So I, can I reduce the casting time? Cause I'll just be rift Andy.

316
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:30,840
Fucking God damn it. I'm sorry. Like you guys just were saying it recently.

317
01:00:35,909 --> 01:00:44,900
That's insane. Okay. Good. I still have to give him a gift. All right. We're going to go. We're

318
01:00:44,900 --> 01:01:12,900
going to try doing rift. Spear is pretty good. You just did a rift. Oh, and I get the heal from

319
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,900
this, but it doesn't even matter. Cause I don't have any lower. Oh wait. Chaos, chaos, chaos,

320
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:57,750
chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos. I give chaos a gift. Can't. Oh, well whatever. The next three standard

321
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:06,070
encounters, you face 78% more foes afterwards wounds have a 33% chance to be rare or better.

322
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:13,719
Okay. The next four encounters get killed foes, toss an inferno bomb at you. Afterward,

323
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:21,079
you do 73% damage striking foes from behind. That's insane. The next four chambers chamber

324
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:31,559
reward previews are hidden. Afterward, your dash strike deals 41% more damage. I mean,

325
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:40,889
that's a, that's a lot more foes, but there's a third of a chance for them to be rare or better.

326
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,460
Try it. I'm probably going to get, I'm going to get my, I'm going to get my ass kicked.

327
01:02:47,019 --> 01:03:04,820
This one for the health. Oh, by the gift. Okay. What is he going to rift? I'm just going to be very,

328
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:42,519
very cautious. Oh, right. That. Yeah. Cautious. He just shot at me. Stop shooting at me. Stop

329
01:03:42,519 --> 01:04:10,039
doing that. Stop it. Backstab, backstab, backstab. Oh, there's a lot. Actually,

330
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:27,639
this is going on for a long time. This is going on for a very long time. Nectar, money, fame,

331
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:49,800
money, or fame, money, or fame. What I've noticed is money or upgrade. It's going on them all there.

332
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:04,010
Whatever. Yes. Oh, bad idea. Oh, what is that? Oh, that's like, I think that's the original

333
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:24,730
Macintosh you screwed up some. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Adventure time when

334
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:31,260
Finn's dad loses his leg. I did not watch enough Adventure Time to know what that is.

335
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:43,780
Is that a spoiler? What? That's like a major spoiler. Did I just ruin Adventure Time?

336
01:05:47,909 --> 01:06:08,170
I didn't, I didn't mean to do that. Stupid. Oh my God. Oh, doesn't that just make the devil mad?

337
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:25,739
Oh, come on. Don't you just want to make the devil mad? Oh, shit. I'm going to die.

338
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:40,409
Just kill this fucking asshole. He's off the screen. I don't know where he is.

339
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,099
I've been killed in Diablo 2 by that exact problem like a thousand times.

340
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,539
You shoot out of like a sorcerer's orb and all of a sudden you hear,

341
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,219
and the lightning just comes off screen and kills you.

342
01:06:55,219 --> 01:07:51,780
Oh, okay. Settle down. Settle down, clown. Oh, it did, did it. Yeah. All right. I have one health.

343
01:07:51,780 --> 01:08:16,619
I think I need to go in here. Only 20. What? Okay. Now do I get the pomegranate? Do I get the

344
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:31,960
palm pomegranate or do I get the mystery bag? Oh, I don't know what this is. Okay. Your dash

345
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:38,340
causes hangover, right? Or you take less damage while it's 50%. 15% less damage. That's pretty

346
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:57,689
sick, dude. What do you think? 6k Andy, hyper omega low. But usually it's like 10k. But usually

347
01:08:57,689 --> 01:09:10,659
it's like 8k. Cry, cry, cry. Feel bad for playing Hades two days in a row.

348
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:37,109
Go for Artemis? No, 6k, 10k, 5k, 4k, 12k, 100k. I don't care. I mean, I would care if there was 100k.

349
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:42,760
That would be a huge deal. That would be a huge fucking deal. So yeah, of course I would care

350
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:55,109
if there was 100,000 people here. Okay. So thankfully this is going to help me. Wait,

351
01:09:55,109 --> 01:10:04,760
do I still have that one? Do I? Wait. Oh, take, get rid of this. Oh, I can't get rid of this.

352
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:24,890
Go fishing? Can I? How do I go fishing? Looks like it's blinking over here. Right? Oh, okay.

353
01:10:24,890 --> 01:11:03,590
Fishing spots are gold sparkles. Wasn't that a gold sparkle? Whoa! Thank you. Never sub,

354
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:21,380
I never donated you. I don't care. All right, let's go. This is going to be Poseidon. Oh,

355
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:31,060
it's a boss. I'll block you again? All right. Just, just be easy. Be easy. And it's not an

356
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:36,020
ideal build for this situation. Although it very well could have been. Actually, it is pretty good.

357
01:11:36,899 --> 01:12:06,899
What am I talking about? It's fantastic for this exact scenario. That hurt. Oh my God,

358
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:41,670
what's happening to me over here? Stop hitting me. I said stop that. I've given a gift to Zeus. Yes,

359
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:54,039
I have. My brothers will not die in vain. I can make as many Diablo references as I want today.

360
01:12:54,039 --> 01:13:15,640
This is great. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Which one of these is a good one? Lightning Strike is pretty

361
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:25,420
good. Call makes lightning. Wait, do I have a call yet? Um, shit, I think. It's definitely this one.

362
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:40,090
It has to be. You're attacking with chain lightning. I mean, of course it is. Thunder and lightning.

363
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:48,359
Kind of, I'm not getting, I'm getting a lot of different gods. His Xanax kicked in. What?

364
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:07,050
Survive for 45 seconds. That chain lightning seriously is pretty good.

365
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:30,739
The purple thing was an enemy. That doesn't activate chain lightning. Oh, no.

366
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:48,899
Done. Nine health. Yeah, I'm kind of getting my ass kicked a little bit here.

367
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:58,630
I don't think I've given a gift to Chile. I have not. Here we go.

368
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:07,579
Lady Demeter, you've shown me warmth and generosity, and I am very grateful for it.

369
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:09,899
Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation.

370
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:20,340
Well suited for the season there, young Zagreus. In turn, as you are honorable and obedient,

371
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,539
you'll have from me what the mortals have not.

372
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:32,890
Breezing lightning slash? Ross Bitten Horn. Cool. I'll see what that is later.

373
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:39,850
This has reached you prior to me, Zagreus.

374
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:51,819
She seems cold. Sort of. Holy shit. What is that?

375
01:15:53,300 --> 01:16:01,050
Your cast drops a crystal that fires a beam for five seconds. 24 to 12 every half second.

376
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:09,930
What does that do? Your call creates a winter vortex that grows over five seconds of licking

377
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:28,970
chill. 11 damage a second. Who cares about that one? This is a heroic one. Slicing Shot.

378
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:46,180
Wait. Slicing Shot replaces the spinner that I have with a crystal every 0.2 seconds,

379
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:51,819
but it's super rare. The Rift is better though. It replaces the vortex. Oh, that kind of sucks.

380
01:16:55,850 --> 01:17:08,569
Ah. Jesus, it's not rocket science. I've got a, I've got a, look at, I've got a legend,

381
01:17:08,569 --> 01:17:15,340
I've got a heroic boon here that I'm trying to decide if I want to keep it. I'm just deciding.

382
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:24,979
I'm not going to write a thesis paper about it. All right, Dementor's Aid. I think I want this

383
01:17:24,979 --> 01:17:34,810
one. I want to keep the Rift. Yeah. I want to keep the Rift. I like it. I like it slow. It moves.

384
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:41,579
I like it. I like it. So that's a call. I'm probably going to live long enough to care

385
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:46,409
about it anyway. All right. What's this? Oh, restore a hundred health. After I do this. I

386
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:50,010
forgot this. Okay. Well, wait, wait, wait. We're going to use Dementor's Call. It's like,

387
01:17:50,010 --> 01:18:09,800
did you call security? I'm dead. I don't, well, that sucks. I already wasted a death.

388
01:18:22,789 --> 01:18:46,659
I just, I forgot the, whatever. Bullshit. I'm annoyed by that. Reset? No. This thing does have

389
01:18:46,659 --> 01:18:54,939
huge range. Why am I getting so close? I'm treating it like a sword. This thing has enormous

390
01:18:54,939 --> 01:19:15,659
range. I'm treating it like the sword. What's wrong with me? Many things. All right. Time that

391
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:34,199
guy out for two hours. He was right though. Time that person out that just said that for three

392
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:55,000
hours. They were both right. I want you to time that person out for six hours. All of them are

393
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,819
right. I want you to give that guy everything he's ever wanted and hope his life is perfect

394
01:20:01,819 --> 01:20:23,880
from here on out. That's a flex. I didn't know that did that. Okay. That changes everything.

395
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,760
That's why I wasn't using it that often because I was afraid to get hit by projectiles.

396
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:51,100
Boon of Germa. I don't even know what I would give. All right. What like element would I be?

397
01:20:51,989 --> 01:21:05,029
Water, fire, ice, earth, air, chaos, metal, meat? What element? Imagine taking a what element are

398
01:21:05,029 --> 01:21:20,470
you quiz and you get meat. I feel that's pretty good. Ensure a chaos gate will spawn.

399
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:33,739
I'm doing that one. I bought this game because of you. It's great. I'm glad you like it. It's

400
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:51,829
very good. All right. I think we're going to. All right. Here comes Meg. All right. Goodbye.

401
01:21:55,210 --> 01:22:00,180
I refunded this game because of you. Odd. Odd thing to do.

402
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:06,170
Tell me something, Zach, because I'm curious. Do your Olympian relatives know the real reason

403
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:14,100
you've been trying to escape? Get around to that in due time. A family. Did anyone happen to steal a

404
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:21,300
red spy? You're in over your head, you idiot. You'll fray what bonds are left between Lord Hades

405
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:31,899
and those ingrates on Olympus. How often do I say that line? I feel like I do it all the time.

406
01:22:32,619 --> 01:23:12,619
Too close. Here she goes. Excuse me. All right. I'm going to do Mother's Mayhem. I don't even know

407
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:16,140
what the movie is called. I'm just going to call it what I'm going to call it so I can have it in

408
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:24,199
my own brain. I know what move I'm talking about. All right. Let's do Mother's Mayhem.

409
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:58,579
Mother's Mayhem is pretty good. Ow. Right into the trap. It just threw me off. What?

410
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:36,949
Double tap. The only damage I've taken this entire game in this boss fight has

411
01:24:36,949 --> 01:25:08,970
been from the fucking floor trap. Almost happened again. No. Screed. This game seems a little easy

412
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:20,890
or are you good? Yes. I don't know. Look, it has four buttons. That means I can do okay.

413
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:32,180
I've refused to believe he's good. I almost beat the last boss on my first try. You gotta

414
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:45,130
give me credit sometimes where I deserve it. If the game has four buttons, I will do okay.

415
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:53,020
It's the games that have WASD, mouse, 10 items, a bag full of stuff, crafting,

416
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:58,140
and a giant quest log that I have to keep track of and oh go talk to this guy and go look you're

417
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,779
gonna go through that it's like a maze you're gonna find this guy at the end of that tunnel.

418
01:26:00,779 --> 01:26:16,899
No. Give me four buttons. Give me an analog stick and I will smoke that game. Let's just do it.

419
01:26:16,899 --> 01:26:22,579
All right. So a lot of these god boons are just to make it so you get their boon first.

420
01:26:27,189 --> 01:26:34,710
What difficulty am I on? I dragged the slider up as far as it could go. I don't know. It was

421
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:42,390
easy, medium, hard, insane, psycho, and torture and I think I was somewhere between insane and

422
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:54,460
psycho and torture. I think it was closer to torture. It really is too bad that this is so good.

423
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:59,340
Two more encounters and this ranks up. Does that mean I get to come back three times?

424
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:15,750
No. It's more life. Oh, that's still good though. All right, let's go.

425
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:33,239
I see you, Tartarus. Give me back my tooth. I've been timed out for 3.627e plus seven minutes.

426
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:56,840
What? Why did you just break your iPhone calculator? Oh, there it is. I can fish down here?

427
01:27:57,989 --> 01:28:08,539
What? Oh, come on. I couldn't have got a chaos fish. That's too bad.

428
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:24,439
No fish. No fish. Well.

429
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:35,300
The next three encounters, each time you special, get hit minus four. Afterwards,

430
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:47,850
you gain another... Oh, well, that's exactly what I wanted to do this run. Or just a bunch of max

431
01:28:47,850 --> 01:29:00,020
health or... Oh, that's really good too though. That's so good. Any money you find is increased

432
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:10,649
by 45% after that happens. But this lets me cast two rifts and it's a three second cooldown.

433
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:21,670
I'm going with the rifts. What was the downside? I didn't care. Oh, for the next three encounters,

434
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:25,829
each time you special... I don't even press triangle anyways. I don't play... I never press

435
01:29:25,829 --> 01:30:02,979
Y anyways. Who cares? Great. These guys, I'm either doing not very much damage or these guys

436
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:21,029
have a lot of health right now. I don't think I'm doing a lot of damage. What the hell? Not

437
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:55,539
doing a whole lot of damage. This is not looking all right. Get out of the fire. One, two, three.

438
01:30:56,789 --> 01:31:09,930
Oh, what am I doing? One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One,

439
01:31:09,930 --> 01:31:26,899
two, three. That's right. That video where the guy, he goes, that's an old one. I want this.

440
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:35,319
Oh my fucking God. That's a really good meme. It's the guy trying to do the old like first man

441
01:31:36,039 --> 01:32:17,460
ever voice, right? Like the caveman voice. Oh shoot. Oh shoot. Lucky tooth ranked up. Nice.

442
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:26,869
And a shop with money in it. I mean, with hearts in it. Thank you. Wait, what else is on there?

443
01:32:31,739 --> 01:32:56,810
I want that too. Oh, well, I hate this thing. Just queue it up for when they eventually spawn.

444
01:33:13,500 --> 01:34:21,779
Don't do it. Blow it up. One, two, one. Hey, that was unfair. Oh, come on. Can I please.

445
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:39,500
You're making me look bad. He's a slippery one. Peewee Herman voice. I gave him a gift. All right.

446
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:49,859
I did not. How have I not given a diet? I have not. Great getting to know you. So please accept

447
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:55,180
this humble offer. Play the one, two, three video. Hold on. I will. All right. What is this? Is this

448
01:34:55,180 --> 01:35:05,380
it right? Let's try male human voice. Count over three. One, two, three. Just pitch up your voice.

449
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:14,340
One, two, three. Let's just add a bit of nasal now. One, two, three. Now the other thing that

450
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:21,939
would be happening, which would actually increase that quality is a very heavy skull that seems to

451
01:35:21,939 --> 01:35:29,460
pull down into the throat there. Now speak. One, two, three. Now let's make a sound. Just

452
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:42,619
let's make a huge R. That's one of my favorite videos. One, two, three.

453
01:35:42,859 --> 01:35:48,779
Here's something. A right princely gift there, Zack. And just so happens, I got something here

454
01:35:48,779 --> 01:36:06,949
I have been meaning to give you. Get a big really heavy skull. Overflowing cup. I like this guy the

455
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:22,739
most. Ionite is my favorite god. Uh, well, okay. This one's good, but this one's better.

456
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:48,890
You've re-gifted it back to you. Oh, did I, did I give him like a bread maker for Christmas?

457
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:52,810
And he just doesn't even know how to, he doesn't have the, the, doesn't even want to open it out

458
01:36:52,810 --> 01:37:02,140
of the box. Doesn't want to take it out because it's a ton of work. I don't want to do this shit,

459
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,659
man. I'll give this to somebody else. I don't think, you know, I don't think a bread maker's

460
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:10,779
ever been opened on Christmas. Somebody, it just gets rewrapped and gives to another party

461
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:27,220
over and over and over again. Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab him, stab him, stab him.

462
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:44,890
That's a stand-up comedian joke. Whatever. Look, all right, so whatever, whatever, whatever.

463
01:37:57,479 --> 01:38:08,649
Oh, oh, I can do two casts in a row because, right, right, right, right, right, right,

464
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:23,850
because of the thing that I got. Right, I forgot, I forgot. Ooh, hey, oh, did I gift?

465
01:38:24,489 --> 01:38:31,180
I already, wait, should I do gift two? No, you already had a gift. What does two gifts do?

466
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:59,689
Just one gift, okay. What's going on with his eyes? That eye is filled with blood. You should

467
01:38:59,689 --> 01:39:11,239
probably go get that looked at. Okay, here we go. We can either do two random boons of yours are

468
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:20,279
upgraded to the next rarity right now, four random boons gain a level, or the next three boons will

469
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:34,659
have upgraded rarity. Probably this one, this one, or this one. Wait, don't I already have the

470
01:39:34,659 --> 01:39:46,859
upgraded rarity thing already? So would this eat, that would be even more. They might be legendaries.

471
01:39:50,550 --> 01:40:27,699
That's a big deal. They might be like heroics and legendaries. This is nice. Dude, one time,

472
01:40:27,699 --> 01:40:32,810
I don't know why this reminded me of this, but the original Punisher movie had a song in it

473
01:40:33,449 --> 01:40:46,250
that was like, you may come back someday, live once more, die once more. So forget about that part.

474
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:53,689
The part that I'm referring to is in college. I remember in the DVD player, that was what played

475
01:40:53,689 --> 01:41:00,020
on loop at the menu screen. And I remember falling asleep with that in the DVD player,

476
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:07,989
the Punisher DVD, and waking up every, I would say, five to 10 minutes over the course of like

477
01:41:07,989 --> 01:41:16,869
three or four hours to, you may come back someday, live once more. And I just don't care. I'm too

478
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:26,569
tired to get up and turn it off. It was at least three or four hours. It was just on the cycling

479
01:41:26,569 --> 01:41:35,930
the menu song. It's very funny because I kept waking up to you may come back someday. So eyes

480
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:44,979
open, you may come back someday. One day, maybe I'm going to sleep. You may come back. So I'm

481
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:56,119
coming. I'm back again, but please, I'd like to go to sleep. Why did I keep doing it? I don't know.

482
01:41:56,119 --> 01:42:00,520
Eventually I just like stumbled out of the bed and just like smashed on every button on the DVD

483
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:07,319
player and hope that it turned it off. Oh, actually, I think I walked up and just hit,

484
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:13,750
you know what the quickest way to turn a DVD off was just open the disc tray. Just walk up,

485
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:19,000
press open disc tray button, go back to bed. But then you'd have the problem where you just have a

486
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:26,250
blue TV. That's stuck too. Because now you have a new problem. You have this blue burning light

487
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:31,720
that's just always on you. So you got to do open the disc tray, turn the TV power button off and

488
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:48,789
go back to bed. Uh, this is, I kind of want the health. Damn, that's pretty good. After using a

489
01:42:48,789 --> 01:43:03,340
call, you deal more damage for 15 seconds. Your lightning effects make foes jolted. Yeah. Jolted

490
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:14,250
really is just so broken that this is cool, but this is broken. I'm doing a cool one.

491
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:28,420
Oh, here we go. This is it. I should have taken the health. What am I doing? It's not broken.

492
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:31,939
It's bad. That's what I mean. It's like, so it's just broken. It sucks so much. Like why would you

493
01:43:31,939 --> 01:43:45,479
even use it needs to be updated. What did you think I was talking about? All right. This one

494
01:43:45,479 --> 01:44:00,810
shouldn't be too bad considering I have the, uh, the rift. Yeah. Why? I was so complacent. Don't

495
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:21,850
give. All right. Quiet. All right. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good.

496
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:52,149
Now we're going to do this. Come on, dude. What are you doing? What am I actually doing? I'm

497
01:44:52,149 --> 01:45:23,399
getting so close for no reason. What the fuck am I doing here? All right. Let's go into the fire.

498
01:45:24,380 --> 01:45:44,810
Into the fire. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

499
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:51,670
into the fire. Stop the fire. My favorite God in spite, by the way, best character,

500
01:45:51,670 --> 01:46:25,560
coolest move set. You didn't get enough love. Go, go do it. We're good. Play smite. I played

501
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:35,430
smite for like 10 minutes. LOL. What the fuck is going on today? Uh, you know, I replaced words

502
01:46:35,430 --> 01:46:41,529
with just like a laugh, I guess I'm busy playing a game. So I don't have, I can't like really talk

503
01:46:41,529 --> 01:46:46,649
that much unless I'm taking a break like this. So replace like words with just laugh in a weird

504
01:46:46,649 --> 01:47:09,340
way. That's odd, right? I'm like every bad guy in a children's show. They say a sentence and then

505
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:26,500
they laugh like that. This is good. Oh, this restores 100 health. You have to micromanage

506
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:34,300
brain RAM. Yeah, guys, I don't know how many of you guys might know this. Some of you might be new

507
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:49,000
viewers. I have like two gigs of memory, but it's incredibly fast. It's very fast, but there's only

508
01:47:49,000 --> 01:48:08,460
two gigs. It's two gigs of like DDR five 6400 megahertz RAM. This is not a whole lot of it.

509
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:26,100
I don't have any money anyways. You have a 24 max FPS brain speed. What about your CPU?

510
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:37,659
Um, that's okay. My CPU, my CPU is like a 32 core 10 gig overclocked CPU, but then it runs

511
01:48:37,739 --> 01:48:49,079
into my two gigahertz tube, two gigabyte RAM. It gets stuck. My graphics card sucks ass too.

512
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:57,539
My eyes are terrible. I'm running. I have like a, okay, I have a mobile graphics card up here in my

513
01:48:57,539 --> 01:49:07,380
head. My vision's not very good and I miss things. I'm really slow like visually a lot of the time.

514
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:13,619
I have like a, okay, I don't even have a G force. I have old ATI, old AMD. See back in the day,

515
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:22,039
AMD graphics cards. We're not the cool thing. I have like an ATI mobility radion 1100 M.

516
01:49:22,039 --> 01:49:39,380
I can fish here. Where's the fishing spot? Oh, come on. Just a lore.

517
01:49:49,670 --> 01:50:24,899
So what's the point of the fishing rod? Hammer, always hammer. Blow it up. Oh my

518
01:50:24,899 --> 01:50:40,260
God. Those things attack you. Good. Who's next? Bring it on. Oopsie.

519
01:50:47,739 --> 01:51:05,260
Don't let him shoot you. Another one? Who has the, who's shooting at me? It's not you.

520
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:14,090
I don't have your bow out. Who the hell's aiming at me? Who was you? Your special becomes a shot

521
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:19,050
that deals 50 base damage in an area. Boring. Hold special for up to 200% base damage and minimum

522
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:30,439
range reduced. Your special deals 50% damage. Wait, that's pretty good. So the special deals

523
01:51:30,439 --> 01:51:46,489
plus 50% damage and plus 50% critical chance on recovery. What does on recovery mean? On recovery

524
01:51:50,170 --> 01:52:01,909
when you call it back. But, oh, right. Okay. I don't really use the special that often. I really

525
01:52:01,909 --> 01:52:20,199
don't. Maybe this would be better. 200%. There's a lot though. I'll try this because it crits,

526
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:27,979
right? So when you pull it back. Okay. Maybe I'll use it sometimes. Eh, I'm not happy with any of

527
01:52:27,979 --> 01:52:57,369
that. Oh, I mean it's, it's good. It's good. But it's a lot to pay attention to. It's good. It's,

528
01:52:57,369 --> 01:53:31,079
it's 135 damage is a lot. I said to remember to use it. Ah, trap. Hey, hey. Two gigabytes can't

529
01:53:31,079 --> 01:53:50,539
load the image. No, I just get stuck. Oh, more singing. This is different. This is different.

530
01:53:54,949 --> 01:54:02,569
Most covered chambers cut of stone stand untold numbers of eternal monuments in tribute to the

531
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:08,409
greatest heroes which mortality can offer there to honor them in life as well as death.

532
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:13,930
This is a new character. This place is near as gloomy as the house.

533
01:54:16,819 --> 01:54:28,859
This is a new character. Oh, it's the bod. Hello, bod. Go on stranger. More shades looking to fight

534
01:54:28,859 --> 01:54:36,380
with you out there. I'm just passing through. You seem less warlike than the rest. May I ask

535
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:42,300
your name, sir? I'm Zagreus. My name is the bod. Names are there to be forgotten, stranger.

536
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:49,180
You shouldn't be here. May the fates favor your journey. But just in case they don't.

537
01:54:49,979 --> 01:54:57,659
Oh, he's a wicked cool character. Oh, the shade offers one of several premium goods.

538
01:54:59,539 --> 01:55:11,479
That's good. That's also very good. Holy shit, this guy's unbelievable. Oh my god.

539
01:55:16,630 --> 01:55:20,630
One but ten encounters. How many encounters are left in the game?

540
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:33,989
All right, hold on a minute. If there's only a few more rooms left that means I'll have

541
01:55:33,989 --> 01:56:18,300
60% more damage for the last boss. Refill me. He's a shield user. I want this. Excuse me. Did I

542
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:44,680
get by a trap? I did. Of course I did. Don't you respawn. I got to drop this somewhere.

543
01:56:45,319 --> 01:57:10,979
Who's alive? Again. Holy fuck. Oh my god. Very bad. Very bad. Where are the bows? You

544
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:57,720
asshole with the bow. Almost did actually. Delicious. Delicious. Okay. That's really good.

545
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:03,020
Number three is unbelievable. You're attacking its chain lightning. So it's just better chain

546
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:11,079
lighting. But this is a full almost 10% more damage after hitting right trigger. This is extra.

547
01:58:11,079 --> 01:58:23,590
Oh, don't. What are you doing? I think they're all very good. All right. What is better just

548
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:38,899
statistically doing 15 damage every 0.25 seconds or doing 8% more damage after doing it? Probably

549
01:58:38,899 --> 01:58:56,500
the third one, right? You want to use it more often. Please click that link so they stop posting

550
01:58:56,500 --> 01:59:13,430
it. I don't know. I want to do more all around damage. I'm going for it. Whatever. All right.

551
01:59:13,430 --> 01:59:36,069
I'll open the link. This is my boon. I didn't get a chance to see it yet. Let's see. All of your

552
01:59:36,069 --> 01:59:42,949
attacks lose 50% damage, but you get a slice of bologna. Take it. Do it. That's worth it.

553
01:59:44,789 --> 02:00:00,739
That's actually worth it. How much does the bologna heal? Boomer. Oh, my God. I almost quit

554
02:00:00,739 --> 02:00:14,489
the game. Boomer sense of humor. What? Come on. That's cute. Um, I need that. I got to heal.

555
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:40,869
Sorry, Ares. Do not hit me under any gosh darn circumstances. You hit me. You hit me. They hit.

556
02:00:52,760 --> 02:01:20,100
Okay. Oh, no. I'm not done. Oh, shit. Who the fuck? Oh, it's this guy with the bow

557
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:28,220
back here. You dick. I hate you. Of course, you guys get to hang out in these like traps.

558
02:01:39,609 --> 02:01:43,800
God, why can you shoot across the whole screen? Game just went down one point.

559
02:01:45,979 --> 02:02:04,340
Game just went down one point. It was a 92. Now it's a 91. You just went down a whole. You went

560
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:17,750
down one millipoint. Spam your cast. I'm using it almost every time. Uh, I'm gonna have to do

561
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:36,260
this one. This is a 92, but Lego Island isn't. I've never played Lego Island. I have no idea

562
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:48,409
what Lego Island even is. What do I do? I'm gonna heal 10% for the next few rooms, which is

563
02:02:48,409 --> 02:03:03,420
like 15 health. I could take the boon or I could take the even more HP. I could get this and I

564
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:09,750
don't have enough for that, do I? I could do both. Always boon. Always boon. Always boon. Always boon.

565
02:03:17,899 --> 02:03:36,760
Oh, yes. No. Yes. Oh, no. Your special is stronger and it looks chill.

566
02:03:38,359 --> 02:03:52,739
So much more damage, but, uh, we're going. I gotta go long term here. I have to go long term.

567
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:12,329
That's it. One is long term. Yeah. But three is longer term because now I heal from more,

568
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:18,380
no matter what, from every source. And I needed that health because I'm about to fight the boss.

569
02:04:23,539 --> 02:04:32,489
One away from the meal. Yeah. Oh well. Three is a short term, a hundred percent. All right.

570
02:04:34,090 --> 02:04:49,260
Really? I didn't get a chance. Don't hit me. Come on. The little guys are going back.

571
02:04:55,350 --> 02:05:16,489
Literally have no idea what just happened. I think I killed them. Just actually hit me.

572
02:05:16,489 --> 02:06:17,819
No, you didn't. There's more? Jesus. Ow. How did you really just bounce off that shit? Come on,

573
02:06:17,819 --> 02:06:50,409
dude. Lost HP already. Yeah. These, these rooms are fucking crazy. I'll get it back. Do not pick

574
02:06:50,409 --> 02:08:05,989
that up. Do not pick that up. No, I hate this place. Kill, kill, kill. More? More? More? More?

575
02:08:05,989 --> 02:08:14,300
I just spit. I spit everywhere. It's everywhere. It's so bad. It's like I sprayed my mirror in my

576
02:08:14,300 --> 02:08:30,149
bathroom with Windex. It's insane. Hold on. This is disgusting. It's horrible. It's everywhere.

577
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:51,060
Oh no. This is not good. Gotta fix that. It's okay. I got it. I'm getting it. The thing,

578
02:08:51,060 --> 02:09:06,729
there's a shop. Oh, I missed it. It's okay. Show the spit and that's gross. Boss time.

579
02:09:07,449 --> 02:09:15,380
It's boss time and I'm not ready. I'm in deep shit here.

580
02:09:28,779 --> 02:09:45,659
That's good. Three dashes is always good. 16 extra gold per chamber is really good too,

581
02:09:45,659 --> 02:10:03,399
but I need this. Thank you. All right. Triple dash. I have a revive. I don't think this is

582
02:10:03,399 --> 02:10:17,430
the one. I'm not sure this is the run. I can dash five times? Wait, wait, wait, wait. I changed my

583
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:34,869
mind. Can I change my mind? That's unbelievable. That's cool. Okay. But I don't, I'm not very good

584
02:10:34,869 --> 02:10:57,060
with the spear though. Whatever. Let's go. Don't give up. You got it. That's true. I have a full

585
02:10:57,060 --> 02:11:07,619
revive and I have five dash. That just changed everything. You got this king. Thanks.

586
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:07,699
Thanks.

587
02:11:26,899 --> 02:12:10,699
I feel like I'm like abusing it. Oh my God. Okay. Pay attention. Just play smart. Wow.

588
02:12:28,579 --> 02:12:33,829
What the fuck am I doing standing still?

589
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:17,590
God damn it. This build is not good. I'm not going with the spear. I feel like this is taking

590
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:53,300
it forever. They haven't even called it Athena yet. I'm dead.

591
02:14:16,380 --> 02:15:00,020
Crushing this up, you fucking truck. This is so long. Get him, get him, get him. Oh, here we go.

592
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:51,939
This is bad. Get the fuck away from me. Will you walk into this, please? Ow, that hurt. Jesus.

593
02:16:19,699 --> 02:16:59,559
Oh my goodness. I just wasn't doing any damage. Spear is not for me.

594
02:16:59,559 --> 02:17:24,229
Sounded like Gary when he ate. Sounded like Spongebob when he ate Gary's food.

595
02:17:28,729 --> 02:17:41,930
I just don't, I wasn't doing enough damage. Oh, you're back. Did I give him a gift? I needed

596
02:17:41,930 --> 02:17:48,010
that special boon that you gave up. Yeah, so that's just how the cookie crumbles, isn't it?

597
02:17:48,010 --> 02:18:05,700
Made one wrong decision. I like shield and I like bow.

598
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:09,219
And if you're also concerned about our court musician,

599
02:18:09,219 --> 02:18:13,620
why don't you commute to sentence yourself? Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.

600
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:21,079
Howard, that's fine. Sure. I get to live. I'll just ask the house contractor since you're too busy.

601
02:18:26,090 --> 02:18:29,690
Contractor, mind locating the court musician's sentence when you get the chance.

602
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:34,200
Oh, I actually, I think I have some quests to do, right? I'm going to give him a gift

603
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:47,959
because I haven't given him a gift yet. Hey, you think you can butter me up with such trifles?

604
02:18:48,680 --> 02:19:02,440
Give me that out of here. You're welcome, father. Shall we get back to work? What the hell? Wait.

605
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:13,620
Well, next. Did I give him another one? He needs two. Why are you here? More pets. I got more pets

606
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:30,389
here, boy. I see. I've heard enough. Granted. Granted what? Oh, all right, let's see. I got 20.

607
02:19:31,930 --> 02:19:40,870
Court musician, free Orpheus from solitary confinement. In the name of Hades,

608
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:52,459
I commute our court musician sentencing effective now. Hello? Ah, Orpheus. Am I composed entirely of

609
02:19:52,459 --> 02:20:02,360
gemstones? I mean, I have another one. What do you do? Hello, Zagreus. I understand you liberated me

610
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:08,360
from my eternal punishment, and so I have returned to serve your father here. Thanks.

611
02:20:09,989 --> 02:20:12,870
Morpheus, Orpheus, Dickus, Malicious.

612
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:21,450
What the hell are you doing? I was in all caps, by the way.

613
02:20:21,450 --> 02:20:31,850
Morpheus, you're back. Look, don't get on father's bad side like that and you're going to be fine.

614
02:20:32,569 --> 02:20:37,370
Besides, right now I think he's angry with me. You guys are fucking hilarious.

615
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:48,360
Now, some people don't like the insanity, but I love it. I love the stream of just insane

616
02:20:48,360 --> 02:21:04,760
consciousness. Are you 12? No, I'm 35, if you didn't know. You're not gonna be 36. What the fuck?

617
02:21:05,979 --> 02:21:14,700
I gotta, like, stop wearing suits and, like, pants and ties. Once I turn 36, 37, I guess I wear,

618
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:24,469
like, clothes. I have to start combing my hair all the way from one side to the other. It doesn't

619
02:21:24,469 --> 02:21:26,870
matter what kind of hair I have, I just have to start doing that.

620
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:44,540
I felt that way about 25, then 27, then 30. That feeling never goes away.

621
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:54,020
I think that feeling turns into acceptance. Act broken. Shit. Can I give a gift?

622
02:21:57,290 --> 02:22:04,309
I think at 40 that just turns into life, you know, that's it. Like, okay, you're 40 now.

623
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:11,350
There's no more like, well, you know, I'm like 30 still. I'm like turning 37. No, you're 40.

624
02:22:11,909 --> 02:22:18,149
Oh. All of your teachers are 40. All of my teachers are 40. Like, I'm an old teacher now.

625
02:22:23,799 --> 02:22:34,549
Midlife crisis? Yeah, at 40. I'm gearing up for the midlife crisis in, like, five years.

626
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:49,450
What's this? Prophecy fulfilled.

627
02:22:55,879 --> 02:22:59,719
It's intended purpose to enliven the house's grim inhabitants.

628
02:22:59,719 --> 02:23:01,639
All right, this is pretty cool.

629
02:23:01,639 --> 02:23:02,840
It's better than nothing.

630
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:10,459
Fresh pomegranates and bread? This actually sucks. A steady diet of pomegranates,

631
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:22,709
French bread, and fish. Is it? I'm not into that.

632
02:23:22,709 --> 02:23:29,860
Wretched broker, what's new, my friend?

633
02:23:31,059 --> 02:23:34,809
I can still do that. I don't think I'm going to do this, though.

634
02:23:36,899 --> 02:23:39,610
Where's the mayo? No, where's the...

635
02:23:41,379 --> 02:23:49,290
Anything but onions, pomegranates, bread, and fish. Oh, hi.

636
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:11,139
To the point where that head gets attached to something and then all of a sudden she gets

637
02:24:11,139 --> 02:24:18,950
powers and can control stuff again. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, no, I'm not, like, I'm

638
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:24,120
not, oh, no, no, no, I'm going to kill you all. That probably happens, right?

639
02:24:33,819 --> 02:24:37,260
Here we go. Ooh, 80.

640
02:24:39,559 --> 02:24:41,159
Very cool. All right, what else do I got?

641
02:24:43,049 --> 02:24:45,530
Oh, who have I met? I've not met three other people.

642
02:24:53,219 --> 02:25:00,600
Merciful End. Wait, there's two other weapons?

643
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:05,479
What the hell are you talking about?

644
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:17,510
All right, I think I want to do a key run. That makes that so much better.

645
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:25,239
Okay, 60% now. Damage is from behind. 40%.

646
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:37,000
Yeah, I did get a bunch of gems. That's right. Oh, wait, you're back.

647
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,040
Oh, let's eavesdrop.

648
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:43,639
You are not to aid him in these matters, Nix. His foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded.

649
02:25:43,639 --> 02:25:47,340
Do we have an understanding?

650
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:56,739
We have an understanding, Hades, yes. He is your own son, after all,

651
02:25:56,739 --> 02:26:03,299
and therefore your responsibility. I, in turn, have my commitments to this realm and to this house.

652
02:26:03,299 --> 02:26:06,819
You're gonna read chat? I do. I'm way more than you think I do.

653
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:15,700
It is not necessary to remind me. Surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself

654
02:26:15,700 --> 02:26:20,739
would much prefer a post within my house over eternity within the lowest depths of Tartarus.

655
02:26:21,780 --> 02:26:23,860
Not that the darkness there would trouble you.

656
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:30,709
You know how a lot of you guys say, how did you miss what they were just talking about?

657
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:35,770
Oh, is it possible that you missed everything that you said? They just said it.

658
02:26:35,770 --> 02:26:39,030
Well, because I wasn't paying attention to them, I was paying attention to you.

659
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:44,819
I was reading your lore during that. I have no idea what they just said.

660
02:26:44,819 --> 02:26:47,940
I have absolutely no fucking idea at all. I was looking at over here.

661
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:50,420
I was seeing, like, what's going on over here in, like, the stadium.

662
02:26:50,420 --> 02:27:07,530
The arena. The stadium. The stadium with 6,600 people in the stadium for tonight's game.

663
02:27:07,530 --> 02:27:23,989
We are, like, the Cincinnati Reds. Is that sports?

664
02:27:23,989 --> 02:27:37,850
Yeah. Wasn't there a season where the Cincinnati Reds lost, like, 14 games in a season or something?

665
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:42,069
Yeah. Oh, that's so sad. That's sad, man.

666
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:47,559
Okay, chambers may contain urns. I think it's time to get this.

667
02:27:47,559 --> 02:27:56,409
To smash everything, right? Or a fountain chamber in Elcium.

668
02:27:56,409 --> 02:28:02,149
Underworld fountains, holy. Fountains provide more health than usual. That's even better.

669
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:19,139
Mash pots. Smash pots and add a fountain to Elcium.

670
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:35,959
And I want new curtains. I want a scrying pool.

671
02:28:47,049 --> 02:28:49,850
And I thought, I thought it said bug safety.

672
02:28:57,899 --> 02:29:07,989
Excuse me? Pardon me? Listen to what? Oh, I could have just listened to something. Go back.

673
02:29:11,989 --> 02:29:28,069
No! What's this? Renovate. Oh. Can I go in that?

674
02:29:39,510 --> 02:29:52,940
Escape attempted. Oh, it tells you how, okay. Killed 1,700 people, let's try to escape six times.

675
02:29:52,940 --> 02:30:00,659
Go to bed. Earlier. What is this?

676
02:30:18,889 --> 02:30:24,649
All is quiet at this time. Ever dreaming Hypnos put a spell upon the house,

677
02:30:24,649 --> 02:30:30,409
as Wilful Zagreus had asked of him. All are fast asleep, save for the prince.

678
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:34,489
It is exactly as he planned. Okay.

679
02:30:34,489 --> 02:30:37,290
Lower your voice, old man. I'm trying to be sneaky here.

680
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:45,100
I'm trying to sneak around my dad's quarters. I'm gonna put peanut butter in his slippers.

681
02:30:45,739 --> 02:30:59,450
He ventures toward the stately throne of his lord father, but ill, expecting what he is about to find.

682
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:03,959
I said shut up, old man. He does not know exactly what he seeks.

683
02:31:03,959 --> 02:31:07,799
What? Is this like a- He only knows that something always has felt off to him,

684
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:16,149
that he does not belong. Who is he, really? Lord Hades never would indulge such questions.

685
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:22,620
So Prince Zagreus would find out for himself. I'm not listening.

686
02:31:23,829 --> 02:31:26,069
Let's see, what? We're gonna look at his- Who is it?

687
02:31:26,069 --> 02:31:29,190
He rifles through his lord father's possessions. Who he's been writing to.

688
02:31:29,190 --> 02:31:34,360
There is not much of any import there. Ledgers and administrative partment work.

689
02:31:34,360 --> 02:31:40,600
Correspondence from Olympus, which he had ignored. No trace of any reference to his son.

690
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:51,219
But then, there is the note. The note.

691
02:31:51,219 --> 02:31:56,420
Written finally in a hand and voice, the likes of which the prince had never seen or heard.

692
02:31:57,610 --> 02:32:01,450
Hades, I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place.

693
02:32:01,450 --> 02:32:04,489
Oh, it's from Persephone. So I'm leaving, even if it kills me.

694
02:32:04,489 --> 02:32:09,959
I won't be returning to Olympus. If there is a place where I belong in this world,

695
02:32:10,680 --> 02:32:13,159
it must be somewhere between heaven and hell.

696
02:32:13,159 --> 02:32:16,260
Perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden.

697
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:22,229
Take care of Cerberus. I shall miss him. Persephone.

698
02:32:23,639 --> 02:32:24,139
Stephanie.

699
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,920
Thus did prince of the underworld-

700
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:28,600
I- I said that wrong all the time.

701
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:33,260
absorb the contents of this hidden letter, written in his mother's hand.

702
02:32:35,020 --> 02:32:38,219
I think Steve rule. Persephone is Stephanie.

703
02:32:38,219 --> 02:32:41,770
My name is Persephone. I sh- I should put you Stephanie, Stephanie.

704
02:32:45,899 --> 02:32:49,420
You're saying this Persephone that she's my-

705
02:32:49,420 --> 02:32:51,899
What? Oh, what the heck? No way!

706
02:32:51,899 --> 02:32:53,819
I always said that Nyx was-

707
02:32:53,819 --> 02:33:04,309
Persephone is Zagoras' mother, and Hades is Zagoras' father,

708
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:08,069
and he thought his mother was Nyx, and they've been keeping this secret from him forever.

709
02:33:08,069 --> 02:33:11,450
Thus did the prince discover-

710
02:33:11,450 --> 02:33:11,770
But why?

711
02:33:11,770 --> 02:33:15,209
...advertently the well-kept truth about his lineage.

712
02:33:16,010 --> 02:33:20,729
Let me know in the comments what you think, why they're hiding that from Zagoras.

713
02:33:20,729 --> 02:33:47,350
I'll see you next time for episode 145 of our playthrough of Hades.

714
02:33:47,350 --> 02:33:48,149
Sinner, is he?

715
02:33:48,149 --> 02:33:54,180
To find the wrong questions and his rage, the prince decided his lord and master.

716
02:33:54,180 --> 02:33:56,020
145 streams of Hades.

717
02:34:00,250 --> 02:34:00,750
Uh-oh.

718
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:04,649
Mommy, you've been lying to me this whole time.

719
02:34:07,899 --> 02:34:10,860
Wait, or should I say, not mommy?

720
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:17,659
You, all this time, you and my father, you-

721
02:34:17,659 --> 02:34:24,250
My dear child, so now you know.

722
02:34:25,459 --> 02:34:26,260
So now you know.

723
02:34:27,059 --> 02:34:29,219
But only half the truth.

724
02:34:29,219 --> 02:34:35,479
I can explain the rest, so please, it never was my wish to hurt you.

725
02:34:35,479 --> 02:34:36,040
Who cares?

726
02:34:52,340 --> 02:34:55,139
I mean, you are my mother, who cares?

727
02:34:55,139 --> 02:35:17,659
I kinda wanna-

728
02:35:17,659 --> 02:35:24,469
This is too good to take off.

729
02:35:24,469 --> 02:35:30,440
I'm never gonna be able to take this off ever again.

730
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:36,700
I like all this, but this one, I can die so many times.

731
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:39,340
This is 50% I get to die once.

732
02:35:39,899 --> 02:35:42,389
Isn't this better?

733
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:56,790
Restore a small amount of health when you enter a chamber.

734
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:58,549
Three health when you go in a chamber versus-

735
02:35:59,829 --> 02:36:02,229
No, no, no, no, I like this better.

736
02:36:02,229 --> 02:36:03,430
I like it, I'm keeping it.

737
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:04,309
All right, let's go.

738
02:36:04,309 --> 02:36:05,510
I don't have enough to do anything anyways.

739
02:36:09,479 --> 02:36:11,239
You can die twice if you buy more of those.

740
02:36:11,239 --> 02:36:14,120
Well, it's 600, that's a huge amount of-

741
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:23,159
So many of you are here to enjoy this game.

742
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:27,930
Thank you for being here each day.

743
02:36:27,930 --> 02:36:43,129
I didn't say shit, that counts.

744
02:36:43,129 --> 02:36:44,170
Whatever, 20 subs.

745
02:36:47,719 --> 02:36:48,520
There's another-

746
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:49,559
There's another weapon?

747
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:53,959
I didn't know there was another-

748
02:36:53,959 --> 02:36:55,559
Oh, I thought this was gonna be DLC.

749
02:37:02,219 --> 02:37:03,940
There are two more weapons?

750
02:37:08,120 --> 02:37:08,840
What?

751
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:10,120
It's a giant glove.

752
02:37:14,739 --> 02:37:16,659
Oh, it's eight keys.

753
02:37:16,659 --> 02:37:18,420
No, they're trying to keep me here forever.

754
02:37:28,709 --> 02:37:31,670
All right, this is the next one you find will be from Dionysus.

755
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:35,819
All right, we're gonna go with the meta here.

756
02:37:39,459 --> 02:37:40,340
And, hmm.

757
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:51,559
I am absolutely a shield guy.

758
02:37:52,200 --> 02:38:02,469
I'm a shield guy.

759
02:38:02,469 --> 02:38:18,680
Let's go.

760
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:19,479
Use bow?

761
02:38:19,479 --> 02:38:20,120
Not yet.

762
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:22,500
All right, this is specifically what we're doing here is-

763
02:38:25,610 --> 02:38:26,729
We're getting a cutscene?

764
02:38:31,719 --> 02:38:43,579
Hold on, are you telling me that I almost beat the game before getting all the abilities

765
02:38:43,579 --> 02:38:46,780
and before seeing the first, like, you're out of the tutorial cutscene?

766
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:51,940
Holy shit.

767
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:54,229
Wow, well, that's too bad.

768
02:38:54,790 --> 02:39:01,110
It's just the edge I need.

769
02:39:01,110 --> 02:39:02,950
Your dash drag deals 50%-

770
02:39:02,950 --> 02:39:04,309
That's, okay, that's really good.

771
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:07,979
That's the bounce.

772
02:39:08,700 --> 02:39:15,209
This charges up faster, but I'm going for the dash.

773
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:24,819
50% more damage.

774
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:31,909
Die Dallas hammer.

775
02:39:32,709 --> 02:39:33,430
He doesn't know.

776
02:39:34,069 --> 02:39:34,469
I-

777
02:39:34,469 --> 02:39:35,270
No, I don't.

778
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:36,149
I don't know what you're referring to.

779
02:39:36,709 --> 02:39:46,139
I'm absolutely a shield guy.

780
02:39:46,139 --> 02:39:47,420
No, no doubt in my mind.

781
02:39:48,219 --> 02:40:03,350
Chthonic coin-

782
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:04,069
What?

783
02:40:04,069 --> 02:40:04,870
Chthonic coin-

784
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:05,510
Perth.

785
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:06,149
Received-

786
02:40:06,149 --> 02:40:08,889
Oh, that's 125 now.

787
02:40:09,530 --> 02:40:31,989
Play portal two?

788
02:40:31,989 --> 02:40:34,229
No, it makes me throw up after 45 minutes and I have to stop.

789
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:47,030
Ooh, and Dionysus.

790
02:40:47,030 --> 02:40:47,510
Here we go.

791
02:40:47,510 --> 02:40:48,790
It's time for a bleed build.

792
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:58,629
It took me like two weeks to beat portal two when it first came out.

793
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:02,540
After 45 minutes, I have to stop.

794
02:41:04,059 --> 02:41:08,010
Hangover damage.

795
02:41:08,010 --> 02:41:08,409
Here we go.

796
02:41:10,809 --> 02:41:12,250
That's probably the one I want.

797
02:41:12,250 --> 02:41:14,219
Because that bounces around.

798
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:18,489
Why?

799
02:41:18,489 --> 02:41:18,809
I don't know.

800
02:41:18,809 --> 02:41:19,850
It's something about it.

801
02:41:19,850 --> 02:41:25,030
Something about the falling through the portals and seeing the-

802
02:41:25,030 --> 02:41:27,500
I don't know, it just fucks with my head and makes me sick.

803
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:29,139
Especially the first game.

804
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:39,350
Actually, one's probably better.

805
02:41:40,149 --> 02:41:44,120
And we get chaos right off the bat.

806
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:45,639
This could be a pretty good run.

807
02:41:54,819 --> 02:41:55,319
Ooh.

808
02:41:56,420 --> 02:41:57,700
Wait, I gotta break the-

809
02:41:58,579 --> 02:41:59,139
Okay, do I-

810
02:41:59,139 --> 02:41:59,379
Is it-

811
02:41:59,379 --> 02:42:01,500
Wait, I got a question.

812
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:02,059
Is the-

813
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:05,239
Should I just break every single vase now?

814
02:42:05,239 --> 02:42:06,600
Or is it very specific?

815
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:08,040
It looks very different.

816
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:14,020
It's just gold pots.

817
02:42:14,020 --> 02:42:14,819
Okay.

818
02:42:14,819 --> 02:42:23,110
What artifact?

819
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:25,989
It is considered a defensive instrument, I do believe.

820
02:42:25,989 --> 02:42:30,229
No ice defect you have discovered or soon shall discover.

821
02:42:30,229 --> 02:42:31,590
It is nothing of the sort.

822
02:42:32,389 --> 02:42:34,250
What is he talking about?

823
02:42:39,219 --> 02:42:41,219
All right, for the next three encounters, you have-

824
02:42:41,219 --> 02:42:42,020
That's awful.

825
02:42:42,739 --> 02:42:47,219
Afterwards, boons have a 16% chance to be rare, but that's not very good.

826
02:42:49,530 --> 02:42:50,969
Take 370%-

827
02:42:50,969 --> 02:42:54,489
Okay, I die instantly from traps, but afterward I get 33 more max health.

828
02:42:55,799 --> 02:43:00,809
Or each time you attack, get hit for 4 damage,

829
02:43:00,809 --> 02:43:03,530
but any money you find is worth 35% more.

830
02:43:03,530 --> 02:43:04,569
I'm just gonna kill myself.

831
02:43:05,129 --> 02:43:10,329
How would I do this?

832
02:43:10,889 --> 02:43:17,059
Would I have to kill everything with my cast or with a special?

833
02:43:18,020 --> 02:43:19,139
Just use your special.

834
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:21,000
I'm gonna try it.

835
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:21,639
I'm going for it.

836
02:43:21,639 --> 02:43:22,760
Let's see how this goes.

837
02:43:23,559 --> 02:43:25,239
Because that's not an attack technically, right?

838
02:43:25,799 --> 02:43:30,389
Does it get hurt?

839
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:41,430
All right, just play safe.

840
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,969
Just don't attack.

841
02:43:44,969 --> 02:43:49,989
And look at this.

842
02:43:51,610 --> 02:43:52,569
I hit the jackpot.

843
02:43:53,450 --> 02:43:56,520
Free encounter.

844
02:43:56,520 --> 02:44:00,920
Wait, fish?

845
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:01,879
What the hell?

846
02:44:01,879 --> 02:44:08,409
I was trying to activate fish rod.

847
02:44:08,409 --> 02:44:09,209
No fish?

848
02:44:09,209 --> 02:44:24,389
Oh, this is gonna take a lot longer than I thought.

849
02:44:25,399 --> 02:44:27,079
Oh boy, this is a bad idea, wasn't it?

850
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:33,020
Shit.

851
02:44:33,559 --> 02:44:36,920
Come here.

852
02:44:37,459 --> 02:44:52,950
Come on.

853
02:44:52,950 --> 02:44:56,680
Kill that little shit.

854
02:44:57,399 --> 02:45:11,190
That's not bad.

855
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:11,670
We're fine.

856
02:45:12,229 --> 02:45:17,059
Aphrodite.

857
02:45:17,059 --> 02:45:18,819
I haven't seen Aphrodite in a very long time.

858
02:45:18,819 --> 02:45:20,340
But I can't do that one.

859
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:21,780
Wait, is the only door I can go in?

860
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:29,159
All right, plus 50% more damage on your special.

861
02:45:40,090 --> 02:45:40,969
None of these will help me.

862
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:44,299
Gain plus one for your cast.

863
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:46,860
That's so much money though.

864
02:45:47,579 --> 02:45:52,600
I have to take it.

865
02:45:53,399 --> 02:45:55,559
Otherwise, I'm not gonna be able to complete this next encounter.

866
02:45:56,120 --> 02:45:57,959
I physically won't be able to do it.

867
02:45:57,959 --> 02:45:58,920
This is an elite room.

868
02:46:19,909 --> 02:46:21,909
This motherfucker has all my cubes.

869
02:46:23,430 --> 02:46:24,629
I'm so dead.

870
02:46:24,629 --> 02:46:34,500
I'm so dead.

871
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:35,000
It's over.

872
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:46,329
Why did I have to get so greedy?

873
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:52,680
Block?

874
02:46:52,680 --> 02:46:53,159
If I...

875
02:46:53,159 --> 02:46:53,559
I can't...

876
02:46:56,600 --> 02:46:57,079
All right, whatever.

877
02:46:57,079 --> 02:46:57,100
Just...

878
02:46:57,959 --> 02:47:00,600
I don't care.

879
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:03,479
Just restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.

880
02:47:03,479 --> 02:47:03,879
Why am I not...

881
02:47:03,879 --> 02:47:04,760
Why am I still alive?

882
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:16,870
The curse can't kill you.

883
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:17,430
Yeah, that was...

884
02:47:18,389 --> 02:47:18,870
That was over.

885
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:19,670
That's why it's called a doomsday.

886
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:20,549
Just rip the bandaid off.

887
02:47:20,549 --> 02:47:21,049
Let's go.

888
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:38,860
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.

889
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:40,540
That was very bad.

890
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:42,500
I'll redo that.

891
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:46,649
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.

892
02:47:46,649 --> 02:47:47,930
That was much better.

893
02:47:47,930 --> 02:47:49,049
I had to give it some effort.

894
02:47:54,629 --> 02:47:55,270
Still bad.

895
02:47:56,709 --> 02:48:01,510
And that guy for life for saying that about me and my voice acting skills.

896
02:48:13,159 --> 02:48:15,239
To say there isn't another death.

897
02:48:15,319 --> 02:48:16,280
Another underworld.

898
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:20,760
I got his dad of old age.

899
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,479
What are you doing here?

900
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:24,649
Isn't like...

901
02:48:24,649 --> 02:48:26,170
Isn't this supposed to be like serial killers?

902
02:48:26,729 --> 02:48:28,700
I'm in hell?

903
02:48:29,500 --> 02:48:31,059
That guy just died of old age.

904
02:48:31,059 --> 02:48:31,299
He didn't...

905
02:48:31,299 --> 02:48:32,340
What did he do?

906
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:41,899
What's new?

907
02:48:41,899 --> 02:48:42,780
Hades is...

908
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:43,579
Oh, wait.

909
02:48:43,579 --> 02:48:44,459
It's not heaven and hell?

910
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:48,299
What's hell in...

911
02:48:50,459 --> 02:48:51,260
Greek mythology.

912
02:48:58,620 --> 02:48:59,120
Tartarus.

913
02:49:01,899 --> 02:49:02,399
Taurus.

914
02:49:03,579 --> 02:49:04,079
Taurus.

915
02:49:15,129 --> 02:49:17,049
Hades is a place and a person.

916
02:49:19,350 --> 02:49:20,940
All right.

917
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:23,020
And serial killers not die from old age.

918
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:26,139
No, but wouldn't you think it would say like was a serial killer underneath it?

919
02:49:26,139 --> 02:49:31,530
50%.

920
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:31,930
Let's go.

921
02:49:43,639 --> 02:49:44,280
All right.

922
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:45,239
I got the shield still.

923
02:49:45,959 --> 02:49:47,260
I want to unlock the glove.

924
02:49:55,899 --> 02:49:59,750
There's other skellies?

925
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:09,540
Every time I get into a little string like this,

926
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:13,370
I just feel like I'm playing Smash Brothers.

927
02:50:13,370 --> 02:50:14,329
Just like get in it.

928
02:50:23,379 --> 02:50:24,180
Mash buttons.

929
02:50:24,180 --> 02:50:25,299
It's not mashing buttons.

930
02:50:25,299 --> 02:50:26,819
You do a string of things together.

931
02:50:26,819 --> 02:50:27,139
You go...

932
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:33,350
I put this...

933
02:50:34,069 --> 02:50:34,790
This is on, right?

934
02:50:34,790 --> 02:50:36,229
Oh, this is even better that I restarted.

935
02:50:36,229 --> 02:50:37,110
It's 125 gold.

936
02:50:37,670 --> 02:50:39,930
Oh, he's dead now.

937
02:50:46,819 --> 02:50:48,819
You mash them in the right order.

938
02:50:48,819 --> 02:50:50,819
Aphrodite right off the bat.

939
02:50:50,819 --> 02:50:53,620
And Aphrodite has not received a gift.

940
02:50:54,809 --> 02:50:55,370
Take one.

941
02:50:55,850 --> 02:51:01,110
Blessed simply to have made your acquaintance.

942
02:51:01,110 --> 02:51:02,629
So this is for you.

943
02:51:02,629 --> 02:51:08,120
Lasting relationships are built on reciprocity.

944
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:09,879
Given all my gifts to Aphrodite.

945
02:51:09,879 --> 02:51:10,600
Gifts why?

946
02:51:10,600 --> 02:51:12,809
What if I give you something in return?

947
02:51:18,469 --> 02:51:19,350
Eternal rose.

948
02:51:19,989 --> 02:51:28,340
Here is why Lord Hades would have kept your mere existence hidden from us all this time.

949
02:51:29,059 --> 02:51:31,139
Perhaps he knew that once you met us...

950
02:51:31,139 --> 02:51:32,979
Her icon looks the tastiest.

951
02:51:32,979 --> 02:51:34,659
That's how I've been determining which one I want.

952
02:51:35,299 --> 02:51:37,319
I feel like that one would taste the best.

953
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:38,760
The icon.

954
02:51:39,399 --> 02:51:40,440
The icon.

955
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:41,799
The icon, folks.

956
02:51:41,799 --> 02:51:42,360
The icon.

957
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,600
It's like a candy heart.

958
02:51:44,600 --> 02:51:48,280
We have like crispy, cold, chilly, like spearmint gum.

959
02:51:49,180 --> 02:51:52,620
We have like the wing, like the baby back ribs for Hermes.

960
02:51:52,620 --> 02:51:54,780
I'm basing it on the icon.

961
02:51:55,340 --> 02:51:55,579
Not?

962
02:51:56,219 --> 02:51:57,020
Okay.

963
02:51:57,020 --> 02:51:57,500
Relax.

964
02:51:58,139 --> 02:52:01,659
Well, that's a good start.

965
02:52:03,159 --> 02:52:04,360
That's also a good start.

966
02:52:11,879 --> 02:52:12,840
I don't need to relax.

967
02:52:12,840 --> 02:52:14,440
He wouldn't let me finish my sentence.

968
02:52:15,399 --> 02:52:18,760
I'm like, oh, I base it on what I find looks the tastiest.

969
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:21,479
He's a sicko.

970
02:52:21,479 --> 02:52:22,120
Icon.

971
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:22,920
He didn't let me finish.

972
02:52:25,190 --> 02:52:25,750
Uh...

973
02:52:30,309 --> 02:52:30,870
Death first.

974
02:52:34,299 --> 02:52:35,420
44 damage already?

975
02:52:36,459 --> 02:52:36,700
Sick.

976
02:52:43,219 --> 02:52:48,860
All right, let's go.

977
02:52:48,860 --> 02:52:49,500
Focus time.

978
02:52:51,829 --> 02:52:53,590
And I like how there's little hearts after you do stuff.

979
02:52:54,229 --> 02:53:09,159
Who's left?

980
02:53:09,159 --> 02:53:10,120
Oh, there's nobody left.

981
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:18,170
Ooh, this is two good upgrades right in a row.

982
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:22,229
I can't even.

983
02:53:22,229 --> 02:53:23,430
You guys are fucking crazy.

984
02:53:37,020 --> 02:53:37,340
Bam.

985
02:53:45,139 --> 02:53:46,500
Your attack hits twice.

986
02:53:49,049 --> 02:53:49,610
I mean, it has.

987
02:53:58,010 --> 02:53:59,370
Dude, you're looking like a snack.

988
02:54:02,420 --> 02:54:02,899
Oh, me?

989
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:12,219
Yep.

990
02:54:12,219 --> 02:54:13,659
That's good.

991
02:54:13,659 --> 02:54:14,860
Go, boy.

992
02:54:16,059 --> 02:54:16,620
I'm sorry.

993
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:17,500
That was very bad.

994
02:54:19,719 --> 02:54:23,399
I may have just been trying to do like a hillbilly voice.

995
02:54:29,750 --> 02:54:30,549
Oh, bad.

996
02:54:31,110 --> 02:54:31,989
That's good.

997
02:54:31,989 --> 02:54:32,469
I can't even.

998
02:54:32,469 --> 02:54:33,590
You can't even do that.

999
02:54:33,590 --> 02:54:39,860
I forgot an urn?

1000
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:40,100
What?

1001
02:54:40,100 --> 02:54:41,059
I didn't even know what they were.

1002
02:54:41,059 --> 02:54:41,700
What does it look like?

1003
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:42,340
I missed out.

1004
02:54:42,819 --> 02:54:44,659
Oh, he's stupid.

1005
02:54:44,659 --> 02:54:44,979
He's stupid.

1006
02:54:44,979 --> 02:54:45,379
He's dumb.

1007
02:54:45,379 --> 02:54:46,260
Don't let him forget it.

1008
02:54:46,899 --> 02:55:00,020
Give me more.

1009
02:55:00,020 --> 02:55:21,319
It's going to be just like the certain thing in a certain game

1010
02:55:21,319 --> 02:55:23,559
that shows up that I miss all the time.

1011
02:55:23,559 --> 02:55:26,920
And it's something in this certain thing that I will not make a reference to.

1012
02:55:29,209 --> 02:55:30,889
And it shows up in some rooms.

1013
02:55:31,989 --> 02:55:34,549
And it's differently colored.

1014
02:55:35,350 --> 02:55:38,709
And it's hard for me to see them sometimes.

1015
02:55:45,219 --> 02:55:45,860
I don't.

1016
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:46,340
I want the.

1017
02:55:46,979 --> 02:55:49,510
Why is it?

1018
02:55:49,510 --> 02:55:51,639
I want the heart.

1019
02:55:51,639 --> 02:55:53,719
Don't keep me going.

1020
02:55:54,500 --> 02:55:56,579
Dash deals damage when you end up inflicting weak.

1021
02:55:57,299 --> 02:56:00,020
Weak afflicted foes are also more susceptible to damage.

1022
02:56:03,100 --> 02:56:04,059
I mean, it should be.

1023
02:56:04,059 --> 02:56:04,540
It's two.

1024
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:17,940
Does that say 35 unmarried is embarrassed by his job?

1025
02:56:17,940 --> 02:56:19,059
Physically deformed.

1026
02:56:19,700 --> 02:56:26,540
What did I have?

1027
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:27,899
What did I do to you, man?

1028
02:56:27,899 --> 02:56:30,219
If I provided you with, say, a thousand coins,

1029
02:56:30,219 --> 02:56:32,860
would you be willing to give me a ride in your beautiful boat?

1030
02:56:32,860 --> 02:56:35,319
Or I should say specifically.

1031
02:56:35,319 --> 02:56:37,860
What did I do to you?

1032
02:56:41,610 --> 02:56:45,049
That's like I just gave you two seconds to scream at me.

1033
02:56:46,379 --> 02:56:47,340
You got to get it all out.

1034
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:51,739
Another Aphrodite door.

1035
02:57:01,590 --> 02:57:02,629
Actually ban that guy.

1036
02:57:02,629 --> 02:57:03,350
That was rude.

1037
02:57:06,680 --> 02:57:07,239
I can't.

1038
02:57:07,959 --> 02:57:08,440
I can't.

1039
02:57:09,239 --> 02:57:11,079
I mean, he's wicked mean.

1040
02:57:11,079 --> 02:57:14,440
But I can't ban everybody.

1041
02:57:15,159 --> 02:57:24,389
Alicia, this is a great build.

1042
02:57:33,479 --> 02:57:43,700
It's just revenge damage.

1043
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:45,829
But when you.

1044
02:57:46,549 --> 02:57:47,350
Definitely two.

1045
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:48,069
Yeah, they blow up.

1046
02:57:48,709 --> 02:57:56,579
Remember, don't let anybody shame you for your life.

1047
02:57:56,579 --> 02:57:56,899
All right.

1048
02:57:56,899 --> 02:57:57,700
Let me be honest.

1049
02:57:58,180 --> 02:57:59,700
Let's break that down for a second.

1050
02:58:01,459 --> 02:58:02,659
Yeah, I'm 35.

1051
02:58:02,659 --> 02:58:03,219
Who cares?

1052
02:58:03,940 --> 02:58:06,420
You just get age gets better with wine.

1053
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:09,459
Except in my case, when you have spinal disc problems,

1054
02:58:09,459 --> 02:58:11,139
you have a hernia that needs surgery,

1055
02:58:11,139 --> 02:58:14,420
and you need to take baths every day.

1056
02:58:14,420 --> 02:58:14,739
All right.

1057
02:58:14,739 --> 02:58:16,040
Hey, how dare you?

1058
02:58:16,040 --> 02:58:20,620
Second of all, unmarried.

1059
02:58:20,620 --> 02:58:21,819
What if I don't want to get married?

1060
02:58:21,819 --> 02:58:23,180
What if I want to be complete?

1061
02:58:23,180 --> 02:58:25,750
What if I just want to live for me, man?

1062
02:58:25,750 --> 02:58:26,549
OK, number three.

1063
02:58:28,459 --> 02:58:29,180
What was third one?

1064
02:58:35,819 --> 02:58:39,659
He's balding so hard that I was physically.

1065
02:58:40,299 --> 02:58:40,700
All right.

1066
02:58:45,909 --> 02:58:47,829
Let me play my fucking computer game.

1067
02:58:48,549 --> 02:58:50,149
Let me play my computer game.

1068
02:58:50,870 --> 02:59:13,159
Dude, this triple hit.

1069
02:59:13,159 --> 02:59:19,700
Look at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1,000.

1070
02:59:19,700 --> 02:59:20,739
Give me some synergy here.

1071
02:59:20,739 --> 02:59:21,219
Come on.

1072
02:59:21,219 --> 02:59:22,100
Crystal thing.

1073
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:23,540
Give me some synergy here, please.

1074
02:59:23,540 --> 02:59:30,520
Synergy since you began your quest.

1075
02:59:30,520 --> 02:59:30,920
It's cool.

1076
02:59:30,920 --> 02:59:31,479
You have.

1077
02:59:31,479 --> 02:59:32,600
I'm keeping count.

1078
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:34,329
Most impressed.

1079
02:59:34,329 --> 02:59:38,020
Everyone's going to marry his computer.

1080
02:59:38,659 --> 02:59:43,940
Oh, yeah.

1081
02:59:44,659 --> 02:59:45,299
There it is.

1082
02:59:48,569 --> 02:59:49,610
There it is.

1083
02:59:49,610 --> 02:59:59,579
Who cares about Blade Rift when I can just go like this

1084
02:59:59,579 --> 03:00:00,860
and they take a shitload of damage.

1085
03:00:02,840 --> 03:00:04,120
Get VR married.

1086
03:00:06,680 --> 03:00:12,440
You know, I'm surprised there is not a VR get married simulator by now.

1087
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:15,319
Where you're the groom and the bride comes down the aisle

1088
03:00:15,319 --> 03:00:18,520
and you exchange vows and stuff.

1089
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:19,239
There is.

1090
03:00:19,239 --> 03:00:21,700
Well, then I'm going to play it.

1091
03:00:21,700 --> 03:00:22,579
I have to play that.

1092
03:00:22,579 --> 03:00:24,420
I have to play the get married simulator.

1093
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,319
Sima Shanzi just gave 10 community subs.

1094
03:00:33,319 --> 03:00:34,200
Thank you, Sima.

1095
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:37,770
Appreciate the subs.

1096
03:00:37,770 --> 03:00:38,889
10 subs just dropped in.

1097
03:00:39,530 --> 03:00:49,450
What happened to me?

1098
03:00:49,450 --> 03:00:50,250
Oh, that's his move.

1099
03:00:50,809 --> 03:00:52,090
Yeah, dude.

1100
03:00:52,090 --> 03:00:54,569
This shit is a get in and get out move set.

1101
03:00:54,569 --> 03:00:55,209
Get in.

1102
03:00:55,209 --> 03:00:55,610
Get out.

1103
03:00:56,569 --> 03:00:56,969
Get in.

1104
03:00:56,969 --> 03:00:57,450
Get out.

1105
03:00:57,450 --> 03:00:57,770
Get in.

1106
03:00:57,770 --> 03:00:58,569
Get out.

1107
03:00:58,569 --> 03:00:59,049
Get in.

1108
03:00:59,049 --> 03:00:59,770
Get out.

1109
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:00,170
Get in.

1110
03:01:00,969 --> 03:01:02,219
Get out.

1111
03:01:04,010 --> 03:01:04,250
Get in.

1112
03:01:04,250 --> 03:01:04,569
Get out.

1113
03:01:05,290 --> 03:01:05,690
Get out.

1114
03:01:06,409 --> 03:01:16,260
Pomegranate.

1115
03:01:16,260 --> 03:01:18,729
What?

1116
03:01:18,729 --> 03:01:19,450
I missed another.

1117
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:30,329
In and out.

1118
03:01:30,329 --> 03:01:31,129
Animal style.

1119
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:34,280
I'm missing so many things.

1120
03:01:38,309 --> 03:01:38,709
Fishing.

1121
03:01:40,090 --> 03:01:41,290
I don't let me miss that.

1122
03:01:42,409 --> 03:01:44,649
I want 1,000 people to unsub if I do not.

1123
03:01:44,649 --> 03:01:45,370
If I miss that.

1124
03:02:04,260 --> 03:02:06,100
Imagine not being shield guy.

1125
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:10,760
Imagine thinking anything else in this game was as adequate as shield guy is.

1126
03:02:10,760 --> 03:02:12,840
Power.

1127
03:02:12,840 --> 03:02:13,879
Delicious.

1128
03:02:13,879 --> 03:02:15,239
Oh, yes.

1129
03:02:21,319 --> 03:02:21,959
94%.

1130
03:02:25,909 --> 03:02:26,629
Pogged out.

1131
03:02:26,629 --> 03:02:27,750
I'm pogged out too, man.

1132
03:02:27,750 --> 03:02:29,350
I can only pog so many times.

1133
03:02:30,149 --> 03:02:30,649
Fish.

1134
03:02:36,329 --> 03:02:36,829
Knucklehead?

1135
03:02:38,579 --> 03:02:39,620
I got a perfect catch.

1136
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:47,040
Oh.

1137
03:02:47,120 --> 03:02:51,870
Of Charon's ways.

1138
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:53,549
Um, should I just take that?

1139
03:02:53,549 --> 03:02:54,350
No, not worth it.

1140
03:02:55,309 --> 03:02:59,899
I need to get him from here.

1141
03:03:01,420 --> 03:03:03,709
All right, well now at least I know what that looks like.

1142
03:03:04,510 --> 03:03:16,350
In and out style.

1143
03:03:24,729 --> 03:03:25,870
I love it.

1144
03:03:25,870 --> 03:03:26,829
I love this shield.

1145
03:03:26,829 --> 03:03:27,709
It's the best weapon.

1146
03:03:28,510 --> 03:03:31,719
I don't think glove can compare.

1147
03:03:31,719 --> 03:03:32,280
I really don't.

1148
03:03:44,190 --> 03:03:45,149
I'm just cleaning up.

1149
03:03:49,370 --> 03:03:50,090
Do you see any fish?

1150
03:03:50,649 --> 03:03:51,770
I don't see any fish.

1151
03:03:52,489 --> 03:03:55,930
Is Greek mythology pog or not pog?

1152
03:03:55,930 --> 03:03:57,049
It's pog.

1153
03:03:57,049 --> 03:03:57,930
It's really pog, actually.

1154
03:03:57,930 --> 03:04:00,489
Come forth, wretches, and stop this meddler.

1155
03:04:02,809 --> 03:04:04,170
Survive for 45 seconds.

1156
03:04:04,170 --> 03:04:05,209
Their attention.

1157
03:04:05,209 --> 03:04:15,469
You got more than that?

1158
03:04:16,110 --> 03:04:18,000
I'm talking about a shield user.

1159
03:04:50,139 --> 03:04:51,659
No, I don't think so.

1160
03:04:52,620 --> 03:04:54,940
I should not be the supervisor here.

1161
03:04:54,940 --> 03:04:55,979
Well, that's better.

1162
03:04:55,979 --> 03:04:59,579
How many keys do I have?

1163
03:05:00,299 --> 03:05:00,799
Three.

1164
03:05:01,260 --> 03:05:17,770
I'm just hamstringing myself for no reason

1165
03:05:17,770 --> 03:05:18,969
because I just leave the...

1166
03:05:18,969 --> 03:05:19,450
I just go.

1167
03:05:19,450 --> 03:05:20,170
I'm like, let's go.

1168
03:05:20,170 --> 03:05:20,809
I'm ready.

1169
03:05:20,809 --> 03:05:29,610
You need to relax.

1170
03:05:29,610 --> 03:05:31,049
I am very relaxed.

1171
03:05:31,049 --> 03:05:31,850
I just want...

1172
03:05:31,850 --> 03:05:33,129
I'm ready to open the door.

1173
03:05:36,010 --> 03:05:36,510
Uh...

1174
03:05:37,469 --> 03:05:40,780
No, no, no.

1175
03:05:43,420 --> 03:05:44,620
I'm so mad.

1176
03:05:44,620 --> 03:05:45,659
He's defeated.

1177
03:05:45,659 --> 03:05:54,020
I mean, but I just got a little happier right here.

1178
03:05:54,819 --> 03:06:02,620
Your call fires a seeking arrow with a 35% crit chance.

1179
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:09,819
The arrows do 120 damage, and it fires 10 arrows

1180
03:06:09,819 --> 03:06:15,090
if you let it fill all the way, which would be

1181
03:06:15,969 --> 03:06:20,049
just base 1200 damage with a 35% crit.

1182
03:06:21,860 --> 03:06:22,819
If even two...

1183
03:06:22,819 --> 03:06:25,059
If even one of those crits, which you would assume

1184
03:06:25,059 --> 03:06:28,420
that statistically three out of three and a half of them will

1185
03:06:30,350 --> 03:06:31,870
talk about like 1500 damage.

1186
03:06:32,899 --> 03:06:33,940
1600 damage, maybe.

1187
03:06:38,079 --> 03:06:39,040
Let's hunt some dead.

1188
03:06:41,219 --> 03:06:42,420
I'm gonna fill the bar.

1189
03:06:55,889 --> 03:06:58,370
I'm gonna take a pee break after this and get some water.

1190
03:06:59,010 --> 03:07:01,540
Crit is 3x.

1191
03:07:02,930 --> 03:07:04,450
Give up already, Zach.

1192
03:07:04,450 --> 03:07:05,329
Was that a sneeze?

1193
03:07:06,049 --> 03:07:06,549
Bless you.

1194
03:07:07,329 --> 03:07:11,760
I have some bad news for you, Meg.

1195
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:14,159
Little by little, I'm getting stronger.

1196
03:07:14,159 --> 03:07:17,540
Aren't I killing her over and over again?

1197
03:07:17,540 --> 03:07:19,540
She's talking like she's killing me over and over again.

1198
03:07:25,420 --> 03:07:27,620
He's got this kind of backwards, I think.

1199
03:07:28,180 --> 03:07:35,309
Look at that damage.

1200
03:07:45,149 --> 03:07:46,110
Already sick.

1201
03:07:46,750 --> 03:07:53,020
Look at cocky.

1202
03:08:08,399 --> 03:08:09,920
Oh, I was trying to stay in the middle.

1203
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:15,780
You just call that an airstrike?

1204
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:20,379
Our UAV is online.

1205
03:08:21,020 --> 03:08:22,299
Our UAV is airborne.

1206
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:40,579
Excuse me.

1207
03:08:41,459 --> 03:08:44,420
Watch out for the guy behind you.

1208
03:08:55,940 --> 03:08:57,219
Get the fuck out of here, Meg.

1209
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:02,920
Yes.

1210
03:09:04,260 --> 03:09:06,459
50, that's a lot.

1211
03:09:07,579 --> 03:09:17,219
Anybody see anything?

1212
03:09:17,219 --> 03:09:19,649
A paranoid to open the door.

1213
03:09:19,649 --> 03:09:32,610
Go get water and pee.

1214
03:09:32,610 --> 03:09:33,569
Yeah, I will in a second.

1215
03:09:33,569 --> 03:09:35,059
Well, I don't even need to.

1216
03:09:41,780 --> 03:09:42,500
Doesn't even do anything.

1217
03:09:43,219 --> 03:09:46,139
Full health already.

1218
03:09:46,139 --> 03:09:50,139
Here comes a family guy funny hell moment.

1219
03:09:50,780 --> 03:09:57,329
Wait, what is this?

1220
03:09:57,329 --> 03:09:59,809
Oh, it's just you getting Aphrodite gives you this thing.

1221
03:10:09,809 --> 03:10:11,569
I have the money, so I'm just gonna buy it.

1222
03:10:12,209 --> 03:10:17,229
All right, bear it back.

1223
03:10:17,229 --> 03:10:19,180
I'm just gonna pee and grab a water.

1224
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:20,299
I'll be back in like two, three minutes.

1225
03:10:23,149 --> 03:10:28,430
Fucking hate streaming.

1226
03:10:28,430 --> 03:10:29,569
Fucking I'm so done.

1227
03:10:29,569 --> 03:10:31,090
I'm fucking never streaming again.

1228
03:10:31,649 --> 03:10:33,819
Like after tonight, it's fucking I'm done streaming.

1229
03:15:44,899 --> 03:15:45,379
I'm here.

1230
03:15:45,379 --> 03:15:45,700
I'm here.

1231
03:15:45,700 --> 03:15:46,979
I'm just, I'm eating.

1232
03:16:02,639 --> 03:16:04,799
Now, you know, I've been into these new streamer snacks.

1233
03:16:08,319 --> 03:16:11,870
These little turkey jerkeys.

1234
03:16:11,870 --> 03:16:18,049
They like Slim Jims, but they're not full of trash.

1235
03:16:18,610 --> 03:16:19,409
I guess you could say.

1236
03:16:21,739 --> 03:16:25,629
And this is coming from somebody that I love Slim Jims.

1237
03:16:25,629 --> 03:16:26,350
I do.

1238
03:16:26,350 --> 03:16:28,479
But they are dog shit.

1239
03:16:28,479 --> 03:16:37,280
Did you guys know that if you ate, if you ate 1600 Slim Jims in a row, you die?

1240
03:16:37,280 --> 03:16:44,299
Did you know that?

1241
03:16:44,299 --> 03:16:46,940
1400 Slim Jims, actually.

1242
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:50,780
If you eat 1400 Slim Jims, you will die.

1243
03:16:51,819 --> 03:16:55,500
Because of the sodium nitrate in Slim Jims.

1244
03:17:02,909 --> 03:17:04,270
That's so fucking funny.

1245
03:17:04,829 --> 03:17:07,299
Just eat, yeah, just eat the thousand of them.

1246
03:17:07,299 --> 03:17:08,260
You'll be all right.

1247
03:17:08,340 --> 03:17:31,409
Okay, if you type in how many Slim Jims kill you into Google, you get a IGN forum of somebody

1248
03:17:31,409 --> 03:17:36,049
saying being very concerned that they ate 15 Slim Jims and they're concerned.

1249
03:17:37,950 --> 03:17:40,590
My mouth and throat are coated in grease.

1250
03:17:42,510 --> 03:17:47,069
Or whatever that orange slimy goo is that oozes out when you squeeze a Slim Jim.

1251
03:17:47,069 --> 03:17:48,350
I feel so gross right now.

1252
03:17:48,350 --> 03:17:51,379
And I think I'm having chest pains.

1253
03:17:51,379 --> 03:17:52,340
What the fuck?

1254
03:17:58,780 --> 03:18:02,079
20, like 2013, 2014.

1255
03:18:02,079 --> 03:18:03,040
Holy shit.

1256
03:18:12,899 --> 03:18:18,799
Okay, I don't, it's not, I'm not talking about me.

1257
03:18:18,799 --> 03:18:21,440
I'm not talking, I didn't just eat 15 Slim Jims.

1258
03:18:22,079 --> 03:18:31,219
I had these, they're organic turkey jerkies.

1259
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:34,500
And they're completely and totally good.

1260
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:35,700
No bullshit.

1261
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:36,579
No crap at it.

1262
03:18:36,579 --> 03:18:40,059
It's just like turkey smoked, smoked turkey links.

1263
03:18:40,059 --> 03:18:40,540
And that's it.

1264
03:18:40,540 --> 03:18:41,260
And there's nothing else.

1265
03:18:41,260 --> 03:18:43,020
And they're little and I can have them on the street.

1266
03:18:43,020 --> 03:18:44,860
Look, I don't eat, I eat Slim Jims.

1267
03:18:45,420 --> 03:18:47,260
Once every like five years.

1268
03:18:47,260 --> 03:18:52,049
Slim Jims are fine.

1269
03:18:52,049 --> 03:18:52,690
They're good.

1270
03:18:52,690 --> 03:18:53,409
They're delicious.

1271
03:18:53,409 --> 03:18:54,450
They taste good.

1272
03:18:54,450 --> 03:18:56,370
Just don't eat more than 10 of them in a row.

1273
03:18:58,639 --> 03:19:02,399
Don't eat 1,400 at the same time because it'll give you, it'll kill you, apparently.

1274
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:07,819
By the way, if you eat 1,400 of anything at the same time, it's gonna, you'll die.

1275
03:19:07,819 --> 03:19:08,860
You're gonna die.

1276
03:19:08,860 --> 03:19:13,040
You could eat 1,400 bags of kale and you're dead.

1277
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:20,579
You could eat 1,400 grams of salt.

1278
03:19:21,620 --> 03:19:25,379
Yeah, any 1,400 of anything will kill you.

1279
03:19:25,379 --> 03:19:30,690
1,400 pieces of rice.

1280
03:19:31,250 --> 03:19:43,459
That's true.

1281
03:19:43,459 --> 03:19:44,510
You're right.

1282
03:19:44,510 --> 03:19:45,790
But actually, that's a lot though.

1283
03:19:46,350 --> 03:19:48,510
How much, wait, how much, how much rice is in a bag of rice?

1284
03:19:53,870 --> 03:19:56,270
How many grains of rice are in a bag?

1285
03:19:56,270 --> 03:19:59,520
Probably not that many.

1286
03:20:04,209 --> 03:20:06,209
One pound of rice is 7,000 grains.

1287
03:20:07,219 --> 03:20:07,940
All right, well, there you go.

1288
03:20:07,940 --> 03:20:10,819
You could eat 1,400 rice pellets and be fine.

1289
03:20:13,700 --> 03:20:14,260
Going up.

1290
03:20:14,899 --> 03:20:17,260
All right, let's go.

1291
03:20:18,450 --> 03:20:19,010
Let's do it.

1292
03:20:19,809 --> 03:20:20,690
I have a good build.

1293
03:20:20,690 --> 03:20:23,969
We're gonna, we're gonna totally own this.

1294
03:20:23,969 --> 03:20:27,870
Change of scenery at least.

1295
03:20:27,870 --> 03:20:32,610
What are we, what about, I'm not gonna say that.

1296
03:20:35,389 --> 03:20:36,590
Pomegranate, perfect.

1297
03:20:46,590 --> 03:20:47,149
Looks big.

1298
03:20:48,110 --> 03:20:49,409
Look bigger than usual.

1299
03:20:50,290 --> 03:20:51,969
Don't, no jokes, play.

1300
03:20:52,770 --> 03:20:53,969
Trying to beat the game tonight.

1301
03:20:55,950 --> 03:20:58,030
Don't make like a funny remark.

1302
03:20:58,030 --> 03:20:58,510
Oh, funny.

1303
03:21:02,430 --> 03:21:03,309
Idiot.

1304
03:21:03,309 --> 03:21:05,629
Oh, by the way, when I was downstairs, I was getting the jerky.

1305
03:21:05,629 --> 03:21:08,590
I started laughing about like the 35-year-old like meme guy.

1306
03:21:09,309 --> 03:21:12,959
I just like thought about his sentence.

1307
03:21:12,959 --> 03:21:15,360
I was like, holy shit, that was like so fucking mean.

1308
03:21:16,399 --> 03:21:23,739
I wonder if that person's still here.

1309
03:21:35,569 --> 03:21:36,370
There it is again.

1310
03:21:37,090 --> 03:21:38,129
Attack damage.

1311
03:21:41,200 --> 03:21:52,190
Or, no, so, or, no, that's 14%.

1312
03:21:52,190 --> 03:21:53,149
That, no, no, no, this is better.

1313
03:21:53,149 --> 03:22:05,440
This is straight up better than this one.

1314
03:22:05,440 --> 03:22:10,959
I could get, yes, Hermes is gonna bail us out here.

1315
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:22,719
We're gonna get bailed out by Hermes.

1316
03:22:22,719 --> 03:22:25,760
He's gonna give us like 30% faster attack speed or something crazy.

1317
03:22:25,760 --> 03:22:27,280
We're gonna get like a legendary from him.

1318
03:22:27,280 --> 03:22:27,760
Can't wait.

1319
03:22:28,719 --> 03:22:36,909
I don't even have, I don't even have a cast yet.

1320
03:22:36,989 --> 03:22:38,670
All right, we gotta, I gotta figure that out.

1321
03:22:38,670 --> 03:22:39,549
We don't have, there's no cast.

1322
03:22:48,079 --> 03:22:48,799
Oh, shit.

1323
03:23:02,420 --> 03:23:07,739
Taking way too much damage right now and I'm not happy about it.

1324
03:23:07,739 --> 03:23:09,100
Please play something else so I can watch.

1325
03:23:09,100 --> 03:23:10,219
I don't want spoilers.

1326
03:23:11,340 --> 03:23:15,579
Um, shit, what do we do?

1327
03:23:18,620 --> 03:23:19,180
I don't know, man.

1328
03:23:19,180 --> 03:23:19,739
I don't know what to do.

1329
03:23:20,620 --> 03:23:28,190
It's too good to not take every time.

1330
03:23:33,069 --> 03:23:34,959
That's very good.

1331
03:23:36,379 --> 03:23:41,600
For 10 seconds, but I just always dash.

1332
03:23:45,489 --> 03:23:46,209
Always dash.

1333
03:23:46,209 --> 03:23:47,010
It's always dash.

1334
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:47,729
It is every time.

1335
03:23:52,540 --> 03:23:55,739
Don't have enough money to do much in the shop.

1336
03:23:55,739 --> 03:24:04,059
So I'm gonna go hard mode and get more Aphrodite bonus combo duo double barbecue bacon bunker burger.

1337
03:24:04,780 --> 03:24:13,020
All right, Aphrodite.

1338
03:24:13,020 --> 03:24:22,420
What is it now?

1339
03:24:26,219 --> 03:24:27,899
Your weak effects are more potent.

1340
03:24:27,899 --> 03:24:29,739
Weak damage reduction 10%.

1341
03:24:29,739 --> 03:24:32,059
Victim deals at least 30.

1342
03:24:32,059 --> 03:24:33,819
It's gonna be 40% less damage now.

1343
03:24:34,299 --> 03:24:43,120
But, uh, am I just gonna be a one-button Barry?

1344
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:49,620
I guess so.

1345
03:24:55,899 --> 03:24:57,809
I forgot you were in the game.

1346
03:24:57,809 --> 03:24:58,450
It's been a while.

1347
03:25:02,450 --> 03:25:13,280
Get away.

1348
03:25:24,020 --> 03:25:25,540
Oh, that's the thing that hits me.

1349
03:25:25,540 --> 03:25:26,420
Are you really hitting me?

1350
03:25:27,059 --> 03:25:45,200
Come on, just bully this guy.

1351
03:25:45,200 --> 03:26:01,739
One shot.

1352
03:26:05,979 --> 03:26:06,620
There it is.

1353
03:26:09,659 --> 03:26:11,420
Your health, your health, your health.

1354
03:26:11,420 --> 03:26:11,920
Cry.

1355
03:26:17,629 --> 03:26:18,129
Cry?

1356
03:26:18,829 --> 03:26:19,950
Why are you saying the cry?

1357
03:26:19,950 --> 03:26:20,989
You guys are crazed.

1358
03:26:29,329 --> 03:26:29,829
Only 2%.

1359
03:26:35,229 --> 03:26:35,790
Damn it.

1360
03:26:35,790 --> 03:26:38,430
Now I kind of wish I took the special from the last one.

1361
03:26:39,149 --> 03:26:41,649
This can be upgraded though, right?

1362
03:26:54,110 --> 03:26:55,389
That can be upgraded.

1363
03:26:55,389 --> 03:26:56,430
Probably like 5% or 6%.

1364
03:27:02,079 --> 03:27:03,040
This is interesting.

1365
03:27:05,549 --> 03:27:06,750
I need to take the health, I think.

1366
03:27:07,790 --> 03:27:08,510
It's getting bad.

1367
03:27:11,729 --> 03:27:12,930
Well, thank you.

1368
03:27:13,489 --> 03:27:17,920
How much more jerky do I have?

1369
03:27:20,780 --> 03:27:21,899
I want extra jerky.

1370
03:27:24,500 --> 03:27:26,020
Did I see the Power Stone news?

1371
03:27:26,579 --> 03:27:29,540
I did not.

1372
03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:33,120
What would do better with this build?

1373
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:34,719
Ares or Dionysus?

1374
03:27:39,790 --> 03:27:40,750
Probably Ares.

1375
03:27:40,750 --> 03:27:43,549
Hope I can do it.

1376
03:27:43,549 --> 03:27:49,649
Wait, I don't get my ass kicked.

1377
03:27:55,760 --> 03:27:56,799
Oh, God.

1378
03:27:56,799 --> 03:27:57,440
This is not good.

1379
03:28:02,110 --> 03:28:04,260
Not good.

1380
03:28:04,260 --> 03:28:04,659
Not good.

1381
03:28:12,770 --> 03:28:13,649
Holy shit.

1382
03:28:22,190 --> 03:28:23,469
Come on, get over here so I don't...

1383
03:28:26,860 --> 03:28:27,579
Get closer.

1384
03:28:27,579 --> 03:28:28,540
Even closer than that, please.

1385
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:30,639
Closer than that, please.

1386
03:28:31,379 --> 03:28:32,340
Get closer than that.

1387
03:28:32,340 --> 03:28:32,819
I can't hit...

1388
03:28:33,540 --> 03:28:42,829
I don't want to die here.

1389
03:28:52,299 --> 03:28:52,799
Yes.

1390
03:28:53,819 --> 03:28:54,540
Didn't die.

1391
03:28:54,540 --> 03:28:55,870
Coachcraft, what can you do?

1392
03:29:05,920 --> 03:29:09,950
Three is, I mean...

1393
03:29:10,510 --> 03:29:14,209
Does that include bosses?

1394
03:29:14,209 --> 03:29:15,010
And does it stack?

1395
03:29:19,579 --> 03:29:22,139
Capcom's making a new Power Stone game?

1396
03:29:26,670 --> 03:29:29,790
Then that's what I want.

1397
03:29:29,790 --> 03:29:33,149
The act of sorcery often ends in an untimely death.

1398
03:29:33,149 --> 03:29:34,190
That's pretty awesome.

1399
03:29:34,190 --> 03:29:34,909
Took him long enough.

1400
03:29:34,909 --> 03:29:36,670
I took him like 25 years to do that.

1401
03:29:36,670 --> 03:29:39,069
So some are able to perfect the trade.

1402
03:29:39,069 --> 03:29:41,389
And take up permanent residence elsewhere.

1403
03:29:42,190 --> 03:29:49,059
I'm sure the witch's circle will reconvene soon enough.

1404
03:29:49,059 --> 03:29:51,700
Anybody see an urn that I can break or something?

1405
03:29:55,170 --> 03:29:57,729
Or health or treasure or anything?

1406
03:29:58,450 --> 03:30:06,209
Tell you something funny, funny man.

1407
03:30:08,850 --> 03:30:09,350
No.

1408
03:30:10,100 --> 03:30:10,600
No.

1409
03:30:11,899 --> 03:30:12,540
Huh.

1410
03:30:12,540 --> 03:30:18,059
That was a slow one.

1411
03:30:18,059 --> 03:30:22,139
That was like a I'm just pressing it down and letting it go because you told me to.

1412
03:30:22,139 --> 03:30:24,370
Must be Uridice.

1413
03:30:29,659 --> 03:30:30,219
Oh, okay.

1414
03:30:30,219 --> 03:30:31,100
This is good.

1415
03:30:31,100 --> 03:30:38,180
I can upgrade the crit one maybe.

1416
03:30:38,819 --> 03:30:43,139
Uridice, how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts?

1417
03:30:43,700 --> 03:30:45,780
Has it been magma flooded like this all the time?

1418
03:30:47,840 --> 03:30:49,280
Say something unfunny now.

1419
03:30:49,840 --> 03:30:52,399
No, you got your one guy moment.

1420
03:30:52,399 --> 03:30:53,280
You're not getting another one.

1421
03:30:54,079 --> 03:30:55,120
The searing heat?

1422
03:30:56,079 --> 03:30:58,819
I'm dead, your royal majesty.

1423
03:30:58,819 --> 03:31:00,979
Searing is just a cooking technique to me.

1424
03:31:00,979 --> 03:31:02,260
Don't need to sleep either.

1425
03:31:02,260 --> 03:31:04,340
I can just keep cooking up a storm.

1426
03:31:04,340 --> 03:31:05,299
It's not so bad.

1427
03:31:13,299 --> 03:31:16,020
Love up to four random boons get a level.

1428
03:31:17,420 --> 03:31:20,620
Two random boons are upgraded to the next rarity.

1429
03:31:20,620 --> 03:31:24,110
We just have to pray that it's...

1430
03:31:24,110 --> 03:31:24,670
Wait a minute.

1431
03:31:24,670 --> 03:31:25,469
I only have two.

1432
03:31:26,270 --> 03:31:30,190
I only have two boons.

1433
03:31:38,129 --> 03:31:39,090
I have five?

1434
03:31:39,090 --> 03:31:39,569
I do?

1435
03:31:39,569 --> 03:31:41,010
Look it on the left side of the screen though.

1436
03:31:41,010 --> 03:31:41,969
I don't know I only have two?

1437
03:31:50,319 --> 03:31:52,479
Up to two could mean just one.

1438
03:31:54,079 --> 03:31:55,040
You have eight.

1439
03:31:55,680 --> 03:32:07,700
Okay, it's either that one or I level it up.

1440
03:32:08,260 --> 03:32:10,059
I'm going for it.

1441
03:32:10,059 --> 03:32:11,500
Two random boons get upgraded.

1442
03:32:12,379 --> 03:32:16,979
One, two, three.

1443
03:32:20,959 --> 03:32:22,000
They get it?

1444
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:23,120
One of those is legendary.

1445
03:32:29,090 --> 03:32:30,690
Oh, that's crazy.

1446
03:32:31,409 --> 03:32:31,909
What?

1447
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:39,979
But that's good though.

1448
03:32:39,979 --> 03:32:40,620
That's good.

1449
03:32:51,520 --> 03:32:52,239
That's good.

1450
03:32:52,239 --> 03:32:53,040
I need health though.

1451
03:32:53,760 --> 03:32:57,090
It's straight up more damage across the board.

1452
03:32:57,090 --> 03:32:57,889
Yeah, that was worth it.

1453
03:32:59,090 --> 03:32:59,809
Good dice roll.

1454
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:02,159
No health.

1455
03:33:02,159 --> 03:33:05,979
I have to be so careful.

1456
03:33:05,979 --> 03:33:06,379
All right.

1457
03:33:06,379 --> 03:33:07,340
Don't blow this.

1458
03:33:07,979 --> 03:33:09,180
I'm going to get some health right here.

1459
03:33:11,950 --> 03:33:16,940
All right, let's go.

1460
03:33:19,860 --> 03:33:38,799
Whoa.

1461
03:33:38,799 --> 03:33:41,090
Burn.

1462
03:33:41,090 --> 03:33:41,489
Burn him.

1463
03:33:41,489 --> 03:33:41,989
Burn him.

1464
03:33:43,680 --> 03:33:44,180
Burn.

1465
03:33:44,719 --> 03:33:45,600
Burn this thing.

1466
03:33:46,239 --> 03:34:01,389
Get out of the fire.

1467
03:34:01,389 --> 03:34:01,950
I can't hurt you.

1468
03:34:02,909 --> 03:34:03,409
Whoa.

1469
03:34:16,100 --> 03:34:16,739
Wowee.

1470
03:34:17,700 --> 03:34:18,200
Wowee.

1471
03:34:24,860 --> 03:34:25,360
Wow.

1472
03:34:32,670 --> 03:34:33,170
Wow.

1473
03:34:33,729 --> 03:34:37,510
Kill these little shits.

1474
03:34:38,389 --> 03:35:01,440
Didn't even take a single lick of damage.

1475
03:35:01,440 --> 03:35:04,549
I mean, at this point, I think I have to hope for health in the shop.

1476
03:35:05,110 --> 03:35:18,420
Pomegranate's good, but I need to be sure.

1477
03:35:19,879 --> 03:35:21,860
And nice work.

1478
03:35:22,500 --> 03:35:23,780
Excellent, excellent, excellent.

1479
03:35:24,420 --> 03:35:25,969
That's very good.

1480
03:35:26,690 --> 03:35:27,940
I'll take it.

1481
03:35:28,500 --> 03:35:31,569
Time for the boss.

1482
03:35:32,290 --> 03:35:42,549
I wish I could afford all this, but I can't.

1483
03:35:43,190 --> 03:35:46,389
75 health is not good for where I am in the game right now.

1484
03:35:47,030 --> 03:35:49,719
It really isn't.

1485
03:35:50,360 --> 03:35:55,139
I need like 100 plus.

1486
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:58,399
Use the call at maximum.

1487
03:35:58,959 --> 03:36:00,000
I'm going to try to this time.

1488
03:36:11,270 --> 03:36:13,030
I still don't have a cast.

1489
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:23,809
This is absolutely mutilating though.

1490
03:36:24,530 --> 03:36:32,739
We just got a bully.

1491
03:36:32,739 --> 03:36:34,500
We got a bully the second they come up.

1492
03:36:34,500 --> 03:36:39,270
It's bully.

1493
03:36:54,819 --> 03:36:55,780
Absolute bully.

1494
03:36:55,780 --> 03:37:12,840
Careful.

1495
03:37:12,840 --> 03:37:13,639
He's different.

1496
03:37:13,639 --> 03:37:14,360
You notice that?

1497
03:37:14,360 --> 03:37:16,120
He's like got different stuff.

1498
03:37:16,120 --> 03:37:19,399
What's going on?

1499
03:37:19,399 --> 03:37:20,520
Why is he back there like that?

1500
03:37:20,520 --> 03:37:21,020
Come on.

1501
03:37:21,719 --> 03:37:32,120
Jesus.

1502
03:37:32,579 --> 03:37:33,139
Don't use it yet.

1503
03:37:33,139 --> 03:37:33,639
Don't use it.

1504
03:37:34,260 --> 03:37:54,180
Don't use it yet.

1505
03:37:54,180 --> 03:37:55,139
No, don't use it.

1506
03:37:55,139 --> 03:38:05,360
All right, now use it now.

1507
03:38:05,760 --> 03:38:06,159
Watch this.

1508
03:38:06,159 --> 03:38:07,600
I'm going to kill them one shot.

1509
03:38:08,239 --> 03:38:21,190
Goodbye.

1510
03:38:21,190 --> 03:38:22,389
Something for the mirror.

1511
03:38:22,389 --> 03:38:28,709
And it's full health.

1512
03:38:28,709 --> 03:38:30,309
So what did we learn today?

1513
03:38:31,110 --> 03:38:38,100
We learned that during a boss fight, no matter what,

1514
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:42,690
wait until you are at full.

1515
03:38:42,690 --> 03:38:45,860
So my idea here is when we get to Hades,

1516
03:38:46,979 --> 03:38:51,479
don't even use it during the entire first encounter.

1517
03:38:51,479 --> 03:38:55,239
Once the second encounter goes through, kill Hades in one shot.

1518
03:38:55,239 --> 03:39:00,360
Once I get through phase one.

1519
03:39:01,989 --> 03:39:03,110
That should be.

1520
03:39:03,110 --> 03:39:04,309
This should be.

1521
03:39:04,309 --> 03:39:05,590
And I put that in quotes.

1522
03:39:05,590 --> 03:39:06,469
This should be the one.

1523
03:39:19,700 --> 03:39:20,200
We'll see.

1524
03:39:32,770 --> 03:39:33,649
I'll save my money.

1525
03:39:34,690 --> 03:39:37,250
The money needs to be saved because we're at the last area.

1526
03:39:42,370 --> 03:39:45,879
Make sure you hold it.

1527
03:39:45,879 --> 03:39:47,559
Wait a second so you don't waste it on iframes.

1528
03:39:48,200 --> 03:39:50,040
Yeah, that's why I held it there too.

1529
03:39:50,600 --> 03:39:53,079
I'm going to give it a full one or two seconds.

1530
03:39:53,079 --> 03:39:53,959
And I don't want him to disappear.

1531
03:39:53,959 --> 03:39:55,000
He goes invisible sometimes.

1532
03:39:57,219 --> 03:39:58,979
I got one more zone here.

1533
03:39:59,540 --> 03:40:02,229
And I've still got lots of upgrades to do.

1534
03:40:02,229 --> 03:40:03,829
Like, all right, it's time.

1535
03:40:05,000 --> 03:40:06,200
I need max HP.

1536
03:40:06,760 --> 03:40:07,909
This is terrible.

1537
03:40:08,549 --> 03:40:09,430
This is actually awful.

1538
03:40:10,069 --> 03:40:21,030
What the hell is that?

1539
03:40:23,250 --> 03:40:43,750
I might actually be in a little bit of trouble.

1540
03:41:12,399 --> 03:41:14,319
This is taking a long time.

1541
03:41:15,200 --> 03:41:20,549
WM1 gameplay.

1542
03:41:21,270 --> 03:41:23,590
Use your cast.

1543
03:41:24,229 --> 03:41:24,870
I don't have one.

1544
03:41:25,430 --> 03:41:28,479
It's just dumpy.

1545
03:41:40,819 --> 03:41:41,700
Always hammer.

1546
03:41:41,700 --> 03:41:57,969
I'm not fooling around here.

1547
03:41:57,969 --> 03:42:01,329
I'm not fooling around.

1548
03:42:01,329 --> 03:42:09,909
Don't crash on me.

1549
03:42:10,469 --> 03:42:13,120
I mean, don't actually don't do that.

1550
03:42:13,120 --> 03:42:13,680
It's like, true.

1551
03:42:20,870 --> 03:42:21,510
Fuck.

1552
03:42:21,510 --> 03:42:22,399
All right.

1553
03:42:22,399 --> 03:42:26,290
What was I swinging?

1554
03:42:26,290 --> 03:42:27,329
I was swinging at the wall.

1555
03:42:28,129 --> 03:42:50,420
Whatever.

1556
03:42:51,459 --> 03:42:57,280
This is not a melee place.

1557
03:42:57,280 --> 03:43:09,520
Let's see.

1558
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:13,520
After your special hits, your next two attacks deal 80% more damage.

1559
03:43:13,520 --> 03:43:14,959
That's unbelievable.

1560
03:43:14,959 --> 03:43:17,280
Your ball rush gains power, it does 500% damage.

1561
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:21,079
So now that gives me a reason to use my special.

1562
03:43:23,430 --> 03:43:25,829
Roll the Captain America shield.

1563
03:43:25,829 --> 03:43:26,389
Get in.

1564
03:43:26,389 --> 03:43:27,270
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

1565
03:43:34,280 --> 03:43:36,549
My shield grows stronger.

1566
03:43:36,549 --> 03:43:37,190
Gold earned.

1567
03:43:42,930 --> 03:43:43,809
Five gold in there.

1568
03:43:43,809 --> 03:43:45,889
That's horrible.

1569
03:43:48,290 --> 03:43:50,129
I don't have enough for anything in the shop.

1570
03:43:50,129 --> 03:43:51,010
So I'm going to go money.

1571
03:43:56,610 --> 03:44:09,159
Where are the enemies?

1572
03:44:11,670 --> 03:44:11,989
Hello?

1573
03:44:12,629 --> 03:44:13,110
Where are they?

1574
03:44:25,250 --> 03:44:27,250
Bad place to fight is those guys on the bridge.

1575
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:41,319
Who else?

1576
03:44:41,319 --> 03:44:46,799
Oh, he's just hiding.

1577
03:44:47,360 --> 03:45:07,940
Will you come out of hiding, please?

1578
03:45:07,940 --> 03:45:11,329
Now I got enough money to really mess around.

1579
03:45:11,329 --> 03:45:18,280
Artemis, for sure.

1580
03:45:19,540 --> 03:45:22,260
Or I could get the lightning jump thing.

1581
03:45:25,190 --> 03:45:36,770
I don't want to get any projectiles.

1582
03:45:36,770 --> 03:45:50,879
Just kill them.

1583
03:45:50,879 --> 03:45:51,360
Spamming.

1584
03:45:54,850 --> 03:45:55,489
Really?

1585
03:45:55,489 --> 03:45:57,879
Who is it?

1586
03:45:58,680 --> 03:45:59,959
All right, there's a chest in here.

1587
03:45:59,959 --> 03:46:00,840
Don't let me forget that.

1588
03:46:33,860 --> 03:46:35,139
Got to kill them faster.

1589
03:46:52,719 --> 03:46:54,079
Good.

1590
03:46:54,079 --> 03:46:54,639
Good.

1591
03:46:54,639 --> 03:46:55,520
There's a chest.

1592
03:46:55,520 --> 03:46:56,239
There, I see it.

1593
03:47:05,110 --> 03:47:05,750
And the shops.

1594
03:47:08,870 --> 03:47:13,010
Oh my god.

1595
03:47:15,170 --> 03:47:16,450
What do I have on now?

1596
03:47:17,170 --> 03:47:25,780
Wait, but no, I don't want that.

1597
03:47:26,500 --> 03:47:28,100
That replaces the double tap.

1598
03:47:28,659 --> 03:47:33,510
The critical effects deal even more damage to armor.

1599
03:47:34,309 --> 03:47:36,739
After you deal a crit, your foe is marked.

1600
03:47:42,120 --> 03:47:45,000
Yeah, in the odd event that that does happen, that's probably better.

1601
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:47,620
That's all right, must be nothing.

1602
03:47:54,659 --> 03:47:55,860
Kill things fast, right?

1603
03:47:56,500 --> 03:48:20,239
Give me my money.

1604
03:48:20,239 --> 03:48:20,559
Wait.

1605
03:48:35,989 --> 03:48:38,149
I couldn't even kill these guys faster than that.

1606
03:48:40,049 --> 03:48:41,809
But I will take some HP.

1607
03:48:42,610 --> 03:48:52,979
Goodness.

1608
03:48:53,700 --> 03:48:59,940
Excuse me.

1609
03:49:00,500 --> 03:49:14,239
Holy shit, that was horrible.

1610
03:49:20,739 --> 03:49:24,920
Get the bombs out of here and I'll be okay.

1611
03:49:30,850 --> 03:49:31,649
Shitty room.

1612
03:49:31,649 --> 03:49:32,370
Shitty room.

1613
03:49:32,370 --> 03:49:33,010
Shitty room.

1614
03:49:45,860 --> 03:49:48,100
Make this motherfucker killed by his own beams.

1615
03:49:49,120 --> 03:49:49,680
Come up here.

1616
03:49:51,600 --> 03:49:53,600
What did I do that for?

1617
03:49:54,319 --> 03:49:55,120
All right, get hit by this.

1618
03:49:55,760 --> 03:49:57,969
Damn it, it didn't get hit by it.

1619
03:49:58,610 --> 03:50:00,209
I just freaked out.

1620
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:22,290
Nice shield, asshole.

1621
03:50:22,290 --> 03:50:23,809
I haven't blocked in eight rooms.

1622
03:50:24,370 --> 03:50:26,850
Yeah, but I mean, come on, I'm trying.

1623
03:50:27,729 --> 03:50:29,010
I'm all offense.

1624
03:50:30,530 --> 03:50:32,370
Well, it looks like we're going to go left.

1625
03:50:33,090 --> 03:50:38,479
This guy is so good.

1626
03:50:38,479 --> 03:50:39,600
This guy is unbelievable.

1627
03:50:39,600 --> 03:50:40,479
He's so good.

1628
03:50:42,559 --> 03:50:46,469
His upgrades are incredible.

1629
03:50:47,110 --> 03:50:49,090
Don't need that this time.

1630
03:50:49,649 --> 03:51:05,520
Oh man, that's greedy.

1631
03:51:06,079 --> 03:51:15,780
It's greedy, I know, but it's damage.

1632
03:51:15,780 --> 03:51:16,819
It's a lot of damage.

1633
03:51:17,620 --> 03:51:27,649
Oh my fucking God.

1634
03:51:27,649 --> 03:51:28,610
They're all bow users.

1635
03:51:29,250 --> 03:51:50,079
Who's next?

1636
03:51:50,079 --> 03:51:58,500
That guy's marked.

1637
03:51:58,500 --> 03:51:59,700
That's what that means.

1638
03:51:59,700 --> 03:52:00,579
The grip.

1639
03:52:00,579 --> 03:52:00,979
Shut up.

1640
03:52:16,149 --> 03:52:18,920
I have no idea what's going on.

1641
03:52:23,510 --> 03:52:24,469
God damn it, man.

1642
03:52:25,190 --> 03:52:27,379
Where is this guy?

1643
03:52:28,020 --> 03:52:41,700
Did you actually come back?

1644
03:52:41,700 --> 03:52:42,739
You piece of shit.

1645
03:52:43,540 --> 03:52:48,020
Let me get in there and kill him.

1646
03:52:48,819 --> 03:52:54,530
Piece of shit.

1647
03:52:57,440 --> 03:52:59,120
You piece of fucking shit.

1648
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:00,639
I hate the shield guys.

1649
03:53:01,600 --> 03:53:04,760
These are my least favorite enemies

1650
03:53:04,760 --> 03:53:05,639
in the whole game, by the way.

1651
03:53:16,959 --> 03:53:18,719
They take forever to fucking kill.

1652
03:53:18,719 --> 03:53:19,760
And then you have to kill them twice

1653
03:53:19,760 --> 03:53:20,399
when they come back.

1654
03:53:21,989 --> 03:53:23,110
Fuck these guys, they suck.

1655
03:53:23,750 --> 03:53:27,760
Oh my goodness.

1656
03:53:41,840 --> 03:53:46,610
What happened to being a shield guy?

1657
03:53:46,610 --> 03:53:48,180
I gave up on that.

1658
03:53:48,260 --> 03:53:54,559
Let's see how quickly I can-

1659
03:53:54,559 --> 03:53:56,319
Oh, these guys jump around so fast.

1660
03:53:57,040 --> 03:54:18,200
Isolate them out.

1661
03:54:18,200 --> 03:54:29,639
Oh, that's a pretty good idea, guys.

1662
03:54:29,639 --> 03:54:30,440
Nice work.

1663
03:54:30,440 --> 03:54:55,360
Look at all the damage you didn't take.

1664
03:54:55,920 --> 03:55:03,889
Yeah, I know.

1665
03:55:03,889 --> 03:55:04,930
Bully, bully, bully.

1666
03:55:05,489 --> 03:55:25,829
Don't let these two assholes get new bodies.

1667
03:55:25,829 --> 03:55:30,579
God damn it, he got a new fucking body.

1668
03:55:30,579 --> 03:55:31,379
Fuck these guys.

1669
03:55:48,100 --> 03:55:49,059
You actually hit me.

1670
03:55:49,059 --> 03:55:50,420
You're hiding behind a fucking wall.

1671
03:55:50,979 --> 03:55:51,780
Get out of here.

1672
03:55:51,780 --> 03:55:53,059
Worth enemy in the fucking game.

1673
03:56:00,920 --> 03:56:09,040
Shop time.

1674
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:09,840
I can get them all.

1675
03:56:09,840 --> 03:56:11,040
This is perfect.

1676
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:12,079
And it's boss time.

1677
03:56:12,079 --> 03:56:14,079
All right, I gotta be ready.

1678
03:56:20,549 --> 03:56:21,350
Kill Bull first.

1679
03:56:21,350 --> 03:56:21,670
I will.

1680
03:56:25,809 --> 03:56:26,209
I'll try.

1681
03:56:46,659 --> 03:56:47,059
All right.

1682
03:56:47,940 --> 03:56:51,940
So now I can go whack, whack.

1683
03:56:52,739 --> 03:56:53,860
This is just going to be a game.

1684
03:56:54,819 --> 03:56:55,700
Get the hell out of here.

1685
03:56:55,700 --> 03:56:56,260
Gold earn.

1686
03:56:56,260 --> 03:56:56,579
Where?

1687
03:56:57,379 --> 03:56:59,219
Kill the Bull.

1688
03:57:00,280 --> 03:57:00,840
Dodge.

1689
03:57:00,840 --> 03:57:01,719
Dash around.

1690
03:57:01,719 --> 03:57:02,440
Be careful.

1691
03:57:02,440 --> 03:57:02,840
Be good.

1692
03:57:03,719 --> 03:57:07,280
The hell did you even see that?

1693
03:57:07,280 --> 03:57:08,079
I have no idea.

1694
03:57:08,639 --> 03:57:09,280
All right, I'm ready.

1695
03:57:15,239 --> 03:57:15,799
Kill Bull.

1696
03:57:17,569 --> 03:57:18,370
Backstab Bull.

1697
03:57:18,370 --> 03:57:18,930
Get out.

1698
03:57:18,930 --> 03:57:19,649
Dodge the fire.

1699
03:57:22,850 --> 03:57:23,889
And save.

1700
03:57:23,889 --> 03:57:25,409
Do not do Artemis.

1701
03:57:36,639 --> 03:57:37,200
And block.

1702
03:57:38,319 --> 03:57:39,600
Hold on, not so fast.

1703
03:57:40,239 --> 03:58:02,309
Come on, get over here.

1704
03:58:02,309 --> 03:58:08,319
Give me a Bull.

1705
03:58:08,319 --> 03:58:12,899
Oh, you double fuck.

1706
03:58:13,700 --> 03:58:14,819
Triple fuck.

1707
03:58:14,819 --> 03:58:16,579
That's a triple quadruple fuck right there.

1708
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:44,559
Right, huh?

1709
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:55,760
I'm ready for the Bull.

1710
03:58:55,760 --> 03:59:13,590
Don't call me a fiend.

1711
03:59:23,159 --> 03:59:23,559
Damn it.

1712
03:59:44,629 --> 03:59:45,670
Oh, fuck.

1713
03:59:45,670 --> 03:59:47,190
He does, oh my god.

1714
03:59:47,190 --> 03:59:48,309
I'm just blowing it so bad.

1715
03:59:53,969 --> 03:59:54,690
Oh my god.

1716
03:59:54,690 --> 03:59:55,889
I keep, he does three swings.

1717
03:59:55,889 --> 03:59:56,930
I'm blowing it so bad.

1718
03:59:56,930 --> 03:59:58,129
It's just so, but hell.

1719
03:59:58,930 --> 04:00:15,989
He hasn't done that fucking move

1720
04:00:15,989 --> 04:00:17,350
the whole entire encounter.

1721
04:00:18,149 --> 04:00:18,709
Eat shit.

1722
04:00:19,989 --> 04:00:22,629
What just happened?

1723
04:00:22,629 --> 04:00:44,760
Don't do it.

1724
04:00:45,559 --> 04:00:53,799
Where's the, where's he?

1725
04:00:55,219 --> 04:00:55,780
Where's the Bull?

1726
04:01:00,709 --> 04:01:01,270
One, two.

1727
04:01:02,790 --> 04:01:04,559
Wait, he did three.

1728
04:01:39,399 --> 04:01:46,719
He didn't, what?

1729
04:01:47,680 --> 04:01:49,440
He didn't run into the podium.

1730
04:01:49,440 --> 04:01:50,559
He didn't run into the pillar.

1731
04:01:51,120 --> 04:01:51,760
What the fuck?

1732
04:02:08,360 --> 04:02:09,159
Oh, fuck you.

1733
04:02:12,520 --> 04:02:13,559
Oh my god.

1734
04:02:13,559 --> 04:02:14,440
It's a choke.

1735
04:02:14,440 --> 04:02:15,079
It's a choke.

1736
04:02:50,000 --> 04:03:06,930
Ready to admit defeat as yet.

1737
04:03:10,340 --> 04:03:12,000
You block everything, you fucker.

1738
04:03:38,420 --> 04:03:38,819
Hold that.

1739
04:04:08,149 --> 04:04:09,110
Oh, shit.

1740
04:04:09,110 --> 04:04:11,110
They call for a friend.

1741
04:04:11,110 --> 04:04:12,149
I forgot about that.

1742
04:04:18,399 --> 04:04:20,000
Flow and steady wins the race.

1743
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:22,239
The hair gets run over by a car.

1744
04:04:22,239 --> 04:04:24,319
Don't remember, forget that story.

1745
04:04:37,170 --> 04:04:39,649
Oh, oh, I don't know.

1746
04:04:39,649 --> 04:04:40,930
That just scared the shit out of me.

1747
04:04:41,569 --> 04:04:55,110
Why's he, why's he blocking?

1748
04:04:56,319 --> 04:04:57,280
Oh, right.

1749
04:04:57,280 --> 04:04:58,079
Goddess Dementor.

1750
04:04:59,440 --> 04:05:02,639
Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

1751
04:05:03,440 --> 04:05:05,030
Where is he?

1752
04:05:05,030 --> 04:05:05,510
Where'd he go?

1753
04:05:06,229 --> 04:05:07,590
Oh, he's right there.

1754
04:05:11,459 --> 04:05:12,659
Jesus Christ.

1755
04:05:13,459 --> 04:05:17,299
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1756
04:05:19,040 --> 04:05:19,840
Oh, no.

1757
04:05:22,159 --> 04:05:23,440
Oh, no.

1758
04:05:23,440 --> 04:05:24,079
Oh, no.

1759
04:05:25,360 --> 04:05:26,799
It's fucking so hard.

1760
04:05:28,399 --> 04:05:33,920
Holy shit.

1761
04:05:33,920 --> 04:05:34,799
Oh, no.

1762
04:05:35,600 --> 04:05:37,840
No, it's so hard.

1763
04:05:38,079 --> 04:05:44,149
I want a rematch now.

1764
04:05:44,149 --> 04:05:44,629
Damn it.

1765
04:05:48,069 --> 04:05:48,709
No.

1766
04:05:49,590 --> 04:05:50,709
Hey there, Doosa.

1767
04:05:50,709 --> 04:05:55,649
How's your endless toil treating you?

1768
04:05:55,649 --> 04:05:59,329
Mr. Hypnos, do you maybe think that you could, you know,

1769
04:05:59,329 --> 04:06:03,569
keep an eye on the procession line before Lord Hades like you were supposed to?

1770
04:06:04,129 --> 04:06:07,620
That's no problem.

1771
04:06:07,620 --> 04:06:08,979
I can definitely do that.

1772
04:06:08,979 --> 04:06:10,260
I'll just add it to the list.

1773
04:06:10,260 --> 04:06:12,899
Afro damage falls off if you don't find the right stuff.

1774
04:06:14,870 --> 04:06:22,530
Damn.

1775
04:06:22,530 --> 04:06:23,569
I thought I had it, too.

1776
04:06:23,569 --> 04:06:31,940
I just got caught in the purple circles.

1777
04:06:32,579 --> 04:06:37,430
I can give the fish to the chef.

1778
04:06:37,430 --> 04:06:37,750
That's cool.

1779
04:06:37,750 --> 04:06:38,549
Hello, Zagreus.

1780
04:06:39,110 --> 04:06:40,149
You look a little down.

1781
04:06:41,030 --> 04:06:44,790
So I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?

1782
04:06:46,559 --> 04:06:46,879
Song?

1783
04:06:47,760 --> 04:06:49,090
I think this is important.

1784
04:06:49,649 --> 04:06:52,000
The lament in the blood or the argonauts?

1785
04:06:53,409 --> 04:06:59,379
Uh, the argonauts.

1786
04:07:00,180 --> 04:07:01,459
How about argonauts?

1787
04:07:01,459 --> 04:07:02,340
Didn't you sail with them?

1788
04:07:04,360 --> 04:07:05,719
Oh, fancy that one, do you?

1789
04:07:06,280 --> 04:07:08,920
Alas, I'm not the heart to sing it anymore.

1790
04:07:09,799 --> 04:07:11,639
I'm glad you like it, though.

1791
04:07:11,639 --> 04:07:13,120
Do I have enough to unlock the...

1792
04:07:13,120 --> 04:07:13,760
I don't think I do.

1793
04:07:14,479 --> 04:07:16,399
All right, let's listen to the shirt.

1794
04:07:16,959 --> 04:07:20,659
Wait, you don't know the song?

1795
04:07:22,319 --> 04:07:24,079
The head chef is going to want this fish.

1796
04:07:24,079 --> 04:07:26,159
What are your sisters up to these days, Meg?

1797
04:07:26,159 --> 04:07:27,120
I've not seen them around.

1798
04:07:29,489 --> 04:07:31,969
We're stretched a little thin, as you can see.

1799
04:07:31,969 --> 04:07:33,489
I have no idea what you just said.

1800
04:07:33,489 --> 04:07:34,049
I wasn't looking.

1801
04:07:35,170 --> 04:07:38,209
All I heard was, I swear to God, this is what I just heard.

1802
04:07:39,729 --> 04:07:40,850
I smell success.

1803
04:07:40,850 --> 04:07:42,209
What does that have to be?

1804
04:07:42,209 --> 04:07:43,170
I didn't hear anything else.

1805
04:07:43,729 --> 04:07:49,329
I didn't hear...

1806
04:07:49,329 --> 04:07:49,729
I didn't...

1807
04:07:49,729 --> 04:07:50,690
I couldn't understand anything.

1808
04:07:55,909 --> 04:07:57,190
I love this voice, though.

1809
04:07:57,190 --> 04:07:59,590
Whoever this voice actress is, fucking great job.

1810
04:07:59,670 --> 04:08:00,309
Good.

1811
04:08:00,309 --> 04:08:00,790
Very good.

1812
04:08:01,430 --> 04:08:03,239
This is my latest hole.

1813
04:08:03,879 --> 04:08:05,399
Oh, 20.

1814
04:08:06,120 --> 04:08:10,200
They're all good.

1815
04:08:10,200 --> 04:08:11,559
The ancient casks of wine.

1816
04:08:11,559 --> 04:08:16,579
It's actually kind of rare that you get a game that actually has good voice acting.

1817
04:08:16,579 --> 04:08:18,659
The toxic-hitting vintage they contain.

1818
04:08:18,659 --> 04:08:25,510
And few are still admitted to anywhere in the vicinity.

1819
04:08:25,510 --> 04:08:28,069
Still waiting for the fest of occasion when we'll open one of these.

1820
04:08:31,120 --> 04:08:32,159
Main character, too.

1821
04:08:32,159 --> 04:08:32,659
Zagras.

1822
04:08:34,129 --> 04:08:35,170
Very collected.

1823
04:08:35,170 --> 04:08:36,690
It's not over the top.

1824
04:08:36,690 --> 04:08:39,170
It's just subtle enough, and it's just interesting enough.

1825
04:08:39,170 --> 04:08:40,370
And he did a great job.

1826
04:08:40,370 --> 04:08:41,649
Actually, perfect job.

1827
04:08:41,649 --> 04:08:49,299
What's new?

1828
04:08:49,299 --> 04:08:50,420
Two keys for 20 gems.

1829
04:08:50,420 --> 04:08:50,899
No, thanks.

1830
04:08:50,899 --> 04:08:51,299
Wait.

1831
04:08:51,299 --> 04:08:51,700
How much is it?

1832
04:08:51,700 --> 04:08:52,260
Can I get a key?

1833
04:08:55,190 --> 04:08:58,389
Is this a psycho thing to do if I buy four keys right now?

1834
04:08:58,389 --> 04:09:08,239
Always use more keys.

1835
04:09:08,239 --> 04:09:08,739
I don't care.

1836
04:09:11,409 --> 04:09:13,010
So what did the fish do?

1837
04:09:13,729 --> 04:09:24,479
Nix must be someplace else.

1838
04:09:24,479 --> 04:09:25,120
Oh, the gems, right.

1839
04:09:25,120 --> 04:09:25,840
Okay.

1840
04:09:25,840 --> 04:09:29,010
Let's unlock the gloves.

1841
04:09:29,010 --> 04:09:31,920
But first...

1842
04:09:45,159 --> 04:10:00,770
I like that better.

1843
04:10:00,770 --> 04:10:01,250
I really do.

1844
04:10:02,129 --> 04:10:05,030
Let's just save the keys.

1845
04:10:07,430 --> 04:10:08,790
Get Death Defiance II.

1846
04:10:09,430 --> 04:10:13,760
I need 600...

1847
04:10:14,799 --> 04:10:15,360
Lopules.

1848
04:10:16,000 --> 04:10:22,069
This?

1849
04:10:22,069 --> 04:10:31,680
Oh, I just get the weapon.

1850
04:10:31,680 --> 04:10:35,600
Hey, pal.

1851
04:10:35,600 --> 04:10:37,840
Watch where you throw those bloodstone things of yours.

1852
04:10:37,840 --> 04:10:39,280
You drop them, you go pick them up.

1853
04:10:39,280 --> 04:10:40,319
You understand?

1854
04:10:40,319 --> 04:10:41,760
But if somebody gives you grief,

1855
04:10:41,760 --> 04:10:44,079
you got my permission to check one right in his eye.

1856
04:10:44,879 --> 04:10:49,670
I just got 5,000 bits.

1857
04:10:49,670 --> 04:10:52,069
50 bucks from Freakout.

1858
04:10:52,069 --> 04:10:54,709
Says, you missed my bits earlier, daddy.

1859
04:10:56,180 --> 04:10:57,379
I don't know if you've been here for a while,

1860
04:10:57,379 --> 04:11:00,340
but I no longer read bits during the stream,

1861
04:11:00,340 --> 04:11:01,299
or after the stream.

1862
04:11:01,299 --> 04:11:02,260
Bits are done.

1863
04:11:02,260 --> 04:11:05,319
Unless, of course, you give Mike that money.

1864
04:11:05,319 --> 04:11:06,440
Pretty much, it's all done.

1865
04:11:07,459 --> 04:11:09,219
I don't know what you're talking about, bud.

1866
04:11:09,219 --> 04:11:11,860
...since the eyes are a lot harder to hit in my experience.

1867
04:11:12,920 --> 04:11:13,959
3D bastard.

1868
04:11:13,959 --> 04:11:14,520
And you know what?

1869
04:11:16,120 --> 04:11:17,989
I think it's time.

1870
04:11:17,989 --> 04:11:19,430
I think it's time for me to say this now, too.

1871
04:11:22,209 --> 04:11:23,809
I think from here going out,

1872
04:11:23,809 --> 04:11:28,049
I don't think I'm not going to read bits anymore.

1873
04:11:28,049 --> 04:11:30,739
I think it's fair that way.

1874
04:11:30,739 --> 04:11:36,309
I think it's fair.

1875
04:11:36,389 --> 04:11:42,690
Because when I stopped doing the at the end of the stream bits,

1876
04:11:42,690 --> 04:11:45,540
the intention was for, you know,

1877
04:11:45,540 --> 04:11:47,379
I wanted to be able to spend more time streaming

1878
04:11:47,379 --> 04:11:49,219
and not time, you know, at the end of the stream.

1879
04:11:49,219 --> 04:11:51,379
If I have to sit here for an extra, you know,

1880
04:11:51,379 --> 04:11:52,819
if I'm sitting here for four, five, six hours,

1881
04:11:52,819 --> 04:11:54,020
and I have to get up,

1882
04:11:54,020 --> 04:11:55,379
and there's like an hour and a half of bits,

1883
04:11:55,379 --> 04:11:56,819
that's the first part, right?

1884
04:11:57,540 --> 04:11:58,340
The second part is,

1885
04:11:59,239 --> 04:12:01,159
I don't want people to think they have to give more money

1886
04:12:01,159 --> 04:12:02,520
now for me to read their message.

1887
04:12:03,959 --> 04:12:06,120
I'd rather just say it's over completely.

1888
04:12:14,600 --> 04:12:18,200
Because that puts a sort of dumb precedent in place.

1889
04:12:18,760 --> 04:12:19,799
For people to say,

1890
04:12:19,799 --> 04:12:22,120
well, he doesn't read anything that's 200 bits.

1891
04:12:22,120 --> 04:12:27,430
I just give 5,000, he'll read it.

1892
04:12:27,430 --> 04:12:33,090
So I don't, I don't like that precedent.

1893
04:12:33,090 --> 04:12:34,450
Just raise it to 200.

1894
04:12:41,590 --> 04:12:43,280
No, like I said previously,

1895
04:12:43,280 --> 04:12:46,120
I said like a week or two ago,

1896
04:12:46,120 --> 04:12:47,799
if you want to support this stream,

1897
04:12:47,799 --> 04:12:49,840
and you like what you see here,

1898
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:51,120
and you like this community,

1899
04:12:51,120 --> 04:12:53,440
and you want to subscribe to the channel,

1900
04:12:53,440 --> 04:12:57,520
do that.

1901
04:12:57,520 --> 04:13:00,049
Nobody at this point going forward

1902
04:13:00,690 --> 04:13:05,030
should be giving me 50 to 100 dollars in one drop.

1903
04:13:09,889 --> 04:13:12,690
And people say, dude, I've been watching you for years,

1904
04:13:12,690 --> 04:13:15,409
like, let me give you 50 to 100 dollars right now, right?

1905
04:13:19,250 --> 04:13:20,450
That's not necessary.

1906
04:13:20,450 --> 04:13:21,729
You don't have to do that.

1907
04:13:21,729 --> 04:13:31,030
In fact, I don't want you to do that.

1908
04:13:31,030 --> 04:13:32,389
I've seen that message plenty of times.

1909
04:13:32,389 --> 04:13:33,750
And then, but this community subs, right?

1910
04:13:33,750 --> 04:13:35,879
It's like, what about community subs?

1911
04:13:35,879 --> 04:13:37,159
I think community subs is a little different

1912
04:13:37,159 --> 04:13:39,559
just because it, oh, well.

1913
04:13:42,520 --> 04:13:44,760
Just completely going just against everything

1914
04:13:44,760 --> 04:13:45,959
I was just saying, that's funny.

1915
04:13:47,120 --> 04:13:51,000
But anyways, first of all, let me, let me,

1916
04:13:51,000 --> 04:13:52,440
all right, let me get through this first.

1917
04:13:54,879 --> 04:13:56,159
Community subs are a little different

1918
04:13:56,159 --> 04:13:58,979
just because when you give a community sub,

1919
04:13:58,979 --> 04:14:01,299
somebody that you're giving somebody

1920
04:14:01,299 --> 04:14:04,420
access to the emotes and the, you know,

1921
04:14:04,420 --> 04:14:05,780
ads that I, wait, that doesn't,

1922
04:14:05,780 --> 04:14:07,219
that's not even real anymore, is it?

1923
04:14:07,219 --> 04:14:09,200
You're giving them the sub,

1924
04:14:09,200 --> 04:14:10,559
they can use the emotes,

1925
04:14:10,559 --> 04:14:12,479
and they can, you know, sub only mode,

1926
04:14:12,479 --> 04:14:13,920
that's available, right?

1927
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:17,399
So you get those perks,

1928
04:14:17,399 --> 04:14:19,520
you're giving those perks to somebody.

1929
04:14:19,520 --> 04:14:21,200
So it's not just me that just gets,

1930
04:14:21,200 --> 04:14:22,879
you know, money and that's it.

1931
04:14:22,879 --> 04:14:24,079
When you give a community subs,

1932
04:14:24,079 --> 04:14:26,399
you're giving somebody that might not be able to

1933
04:14:26,959 --> 04:14:29,120
potentially afford to pay $5 a month,

1934
04:14:29,680 --> 04:14:35,780
that, hey, you can use the emotes.

1935
04:14:35,780 --> 04:14:39,299
So rather than just be just accepting 500,

1936
04:14:39,299 --> 04:14:41,620
you know, 1,000, 550 bucks, 100 bucks,

1937
04:14:41,620 --> 04:14:42,899
200 bucks from one person,

1938
04:14:46,290 --> 04:14:47,649
I just, I think it's more fair that way.

1939
04:14:48,290 --> 04:14:54,690
Just admit it's because you can't read.

1940
04:14:54,690 --> 04:14:57,170
It's been an elaborate scheme this whole time.

1941
04:14:57,170 --> 04:15:00,500
If it's more stuff to use channel points on,

1942
04:15:01,780 --> 04:15:04,260
I want to turn on that like gambling thing,

1943
04:15:04,260 --> 04:15:05,219
like the predict thing.

1944
04:15:05,219 --> 04:15:06,899
I don't have access to that.

1945
04:15:06,899 --> 04:15:08,500
I wish I did, but I don't have,

1946
04:15:08,500 --> 04:15:09,780
I don't think I have access to it.

1947
04:15:09,780 --> 04:15:10,579
I looked in my thing.

1948
04:15:10,579 --> 04:15:19,379
I don't have it.

1949
04:15:19,379 --> 04:15:20,579
It won't give it to me.

1950
04:15:21,700 --> 04:15:22,579
All right, let's open it.

1951
04:15:22,579 --> 04:15:23,059
I don't care.

1952
04:15:23,059 --> 04:15:23,700
What is it?

1953
04:15:23,700 --> 04:15:25,059
I want, that's what I saved it up for.

1954
04:15:28,680 --> 04:15:29,180
Old?

1955
04:15:33,219 --> 04:15:35,729
A rising cutter?

1956
04:15:39,680 --> 04:15:40,399
Dash strike.

1957
04:15:42,079 --> 04:15:43,360
Dash uppercut.

1958
04:15:43,360 --> 04:15:52,159
It's a monk build.

1959
04:15:53,520 --> 04:15:55,520
So there is no, all right, that's going to be weird.

1960
04:16:01,600 --> 04:16:03,760
I'll give him a try.

1961
04:16:03,760 --> 04:16:04,719
I'm probably going to get my ass kicked.

1962
04:16:04,719 --> 04:16:06,479
But let's go over these subs.

1963
04:16:06,479 --> 04:16:07,920
Just really quickly, because there was a lot.

1964
04:16:09,059 --> 04:16:10,979
Addy cake gave 20 community subs,

1965
04:16:10,979 --> 04:16:12,180
which is a ton of money.

1966
04:16:12,180 --> 04:16:14,500
That is more than I even said to not give.

1967
04:16:15,219 --> 04:16:16,659
Right?

1968
04:16:16,659 --> 04:16:19,459
Thanks to the huge amount of money and the community subs.

1969
04:16:20,100 --> 04:16:21,620
Labster five community subs.

1970
04:16:21,620 --> 04:16:23,700
Nondescript civilian 25 community subs,

1971
04:16:23,700 --> 04:16:26,500
which is a shitload of money.

1972
04:16:26,500 --> 04:16:27,059
Litigation.

1973
04:16:27,059 --> 04:16:28,020
Thanks for five subs.

1974
04:16:28,020 --> 04:16:28,659
And destroy.

1975
04:16:28,659 --> 04:16:29,700
Thanks for five subs.

1976
04:16:29,700 --> 04:16:30,420
Destroy, dude.

1977
04:16:30,420 --> 04:16:42,819
You can play with boppities in this game.

1978
04:16:42,819 --> 04:16:43,219
Go left.

1979
04:16:43,219 --> 04:16:50,930
It's a secret area, but he's still reading them.

1980
04:16:50,930 --> 04:16:52,209
Well, community subs.

1981
04:16:52,209 --> 04:16:58,020
I feel like acknowledging community subs is like,

1982
04:16:58,020 --> 04:17:00,340
oh, look, some of you got subs.

1983
04:17:00,340 --> 04:17:00,899
I don't know.

1984
04:17:00,899 --> 04:17:01,540
What do you think?

1985
04:17:01,540 --> 04:17:05,280
But then that brings in the, wait,

1986
04:17:05,280 --> 04:17:07,120
but I could just give a bunch of money

1987
04:17:07,120 --> 04:17:08,719
if I give a shitload of subs, right?

1988
04:17:10,420 --> 04:17:11,139
Yeah, I don't know.

1989
04:17:11,780 --> 04:17:13,379
I just don't want people to think they have to give

1990
04:17:13,379 --> 04:17:16,260
an absolute shitload of money to get me to read it

1991
04:17:16,260 --> 04:17:18,500
when that was not the intention in the first place.

1992
04:17:18,500 --> 04:17:21,000
Just acknowledge nothing.

1993
04:17:21,000 --> 04:17:22,120
Just harvest money.

1994
04:17:25,239 --> 04:17:26,200
I'll try the fists.

1995
04:17:26,840 --> 04:17:29,670
I feel like this is boring.

1996
04:17:29,829 --> 04:17:31,860
My blade.

1997
04:17:31,860 --> 04:17:33,620
Not the fists.

1998
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:34,579
Like what I've been doing.

1999
04:17:34,579 --> 04:17:39,479
Just the meta of take coin purse, replace with tooth.

2000
04:17:39,479 --> 04:17:42,469
I feel like I, is this boring?

2001
04:17:42,469 --> 04:17:52,340
At just 25 health, but they're not.

2002
04:17:52,340 --> 04:17:53,219
But this upgrades.

2003
04:17:53,219 --> 04:17:55,139
If I use this enough, this is okay.

2004
04:17:55,139 --> 04:17:57,559
Does this eventually get up to 75 health?

2005
04:18:03,090 --> 04:18:03,969
That's a huge deal.

2006
04:18:04,530 --> 04:18:04,850
50.

2007
04:18:04,850 --> 04:18:05,569
That's a big deal.

2008
04:18:18,819 --> 04:18:20,659
Level up all your trinkets of a lad variety

2009
04:18:20,659 --> 04:18:22,180
and you will understand what you want from it.

2010
04:18:23,040 --> 04:18:23,760
Yeah, you know what?

2011
04:18:45,559 --> 04:18:51,620
Let's try these.

2012
04:18:52,260 --> 04:18:58,389
But I'll try those after I put on, I want the money.

2013
04:19:06,229 --> 04:19:07,670
It's all about the money.

2014
04:19:08,389 --> 04:19:11,409
It's a good start.

2015
04:19:13,680 --> 04:19:18,000
Your attack becomes a three hit sequence and each deals 40 base damage.

2016
04:19:18,639 --> 04:19:25,090
You are sturdy while you use your attack.

2017
04:19:25,729 --> 04:19:27,639
You take 30% less damage.

2018
04:19:27,639 --> 04:19:28,920
Your actions cannot be interrupted.

2019
04:19:32,440 --> 04:19:34,040
Oh, three is really good too.

2020
04:19:34,040 --> 04:19:35,000
Three is insane.

2021
04:19:35,719 --> 04:19:51,120
It just breaks any armor instantly.

2022
04:19:51,120 --> 04:19:52,159
They seem like they're kind of fun,

2023
04:19:52,159 --> 04:19:55,360
but the holding down X thing is probably going to mess me up.

2024
04:19:55,360 --> 04:20:05,750
I feel like Little Mac when I have these on.

2025
04:20:06,309 --> 04:20:14,760
I love the dash uppercut.

2026
04:20:14,760 --> 04:20:15,239
It's awesome.

2027
04:20:16,870 --> 04:20:19,350
Try getting Artemis.

2028
04:20:19,909 --> 04:20:21,350
The fast firing is awesome.

2029
04:20:21,350 --> 04:20:22,469
Yeah, that's true.

2030
04:20:23,350 --> 04:20:24,149
What about Zeus?

2031
04:20:24,149 --> 04:20:26,950
Zeus like the chain lightning going chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain.

2032
04:20:27,590 --> 04:20:43,780
So now I understand why, okay.

2033
04:20:43,780 --> 04:20:45,059
Oh, you beat the game.

2034
04:20:45,059 --> 04:20:46,819
No, it's not even what I'm doing.

2035
04:20:47,540 --> 04:20:50,399
That's like saying that if you beat mom's foot,

2036
04:20:50,399 --> 04:20:52,159
then you win Binding of Isaac.

2037
04:20:52,239 --> 04:20:53,200
That's five more subs.

2038
04:20:53,200 --> 04:20:53,840
What?

2039
04:20:53,840 --> 04:20:54,340
Oh, well.

2040
04:21:00,020 --> 04:21:00,739
25?

2041
04:21:00,739 --> 04:21:01,700
All right, I got to shut up.

2042
04:21:02,340 --> 04:21:13,639
Let's get something good.

2043
04:21:24,280 --> 04:21:25,399
Why do I owe subs?

2044
04:21:25,399 --> 04:21:28,180
Because I signed a contract yesterday

2045
04:21:28,180 --> 04:21:30,120
when I first started playing the game

2046
04:21:30,120 --> 04:21:34,879
that I would not reference Binding of Isaac,

2047
04:21:34,879 --> 04:21:39,559
World of Warcraft, Dark Souls,

2048
04:21:39,559 --> 04:21:40,840
and I forget the last game.

2049
04:21:40,840 --> 04:21:42,040
I seriously don't know what it was.

2050
04:21:42,600 --> 04:21:43,399
I forget what it was.

2051
04:21:43,879 --> 04:21:46,229
What was the fourth one?

2052
04:21:46,229 --> 04:21:49,079
Hearthstone.

2053
04:21:49,079 --> 04:21:49,639
Right, right.

2054
04:21:50,200 --> 04:21:52,280
So if I've referenced those...

2055
04:21:53,079 --> 04:21:54,200
No, that's not fair.

2056
04:21:54,200 --> 04:21:55,399
We're in a timeout right now.

2057
04:21:55,399 --> 04:21:56,280
This is a pause.

2058
04:21:56,280 --> 04:21:56,780
I'm...

2059
04:21:57,399 --> 04:21:59,319
No, that's not what this is.

2060
04:21:59,319 --> 04:22:01,959
We are not referencing that in the game.

2061
04:22:01,959 --> 04:22:05,239
We are referencing the fact that that was what the con...

2062
04:22:05,239 --> 04:22:06,920
I'm stating what the contract is.

2063
04:22:11,840 --> 04:22:13,280
And the person that just asked that,

2064
04:22:13,280 --> 04:22:14,319
they're probably like, what the...

2065
04:22:14,319 --> 04:22:15,280
Who fucking cares?

2066
04:22:15,280 --> 04:22:16,159
Like, what are you talking about?

2067
04:22:17,190 --> 04:22:18,790
I have a tendency on this stream

2068
04:22:19,760 --> 04:22:24,000
to always call back to those four games

2069
04:22:25,239 --> 04:22:27,079
all the time, like every stream.

2070
04:22:27,079 --> 04:22:29,159
So I'm trying to give myself a...

2071
04:22:29,159 --> 04:22:30,719
I'm trying to get away from it.

2072
04:22:30,719 --> 04:22:41,250
Your special causes a bolt...

2073
04:22:41,250 --> 04:22:42,770
Lightning Bolt to strike nearby foes.

2074
04:22:42,770 --> 04:22:43,969
That looks pretty good.

2075
04:22:43,969 --> 04:22:50,260
Your dash causes a lightning bolt to...

2076
04:22:50,260 --> 04:22:51,780
Ah, that's actually good too.

2077
04:22:51,780 --> 04:22:54,520
I like this one.

2078
04:22:59,110 --> 04:22:59,750
Ooh, all right.

2079
04:23:00,389 --> 04:23:02,389
Water or fire?

2080
04:23:02,389 --> 04:23:04,129
How about Poseidon?

2081
04:23:04,930 --> 04:23:17,969
Pretty good.

2082
04:23:17,969 --> 04:23:18,469
Uppercut.

2083
04:23:24,799 --> 04:23:27,120
There's a pretty heavy reach on this thing too.

2084
04:23:27,920 --> 04:23:40,530
Do you know why I like this game so much?

2085
04:23:40,530 --> 04:23:42,450
And why I'm very into playing this game?

2086
04:23:43,170 --> 04:23:47,440
It's mainly because it has actually been a very long time

2087
04:23:47,440 --> 04:23:49,280
since a game like this has come out

2088
04:23:51,680 --> 04:23:53,200
that I've actually enjoyed playing.

2089
04:23:56,760 --> 04:23:59,959
This rogue-like items and upgrades room to room.

2090
04:24:00,760 --> 04:24:01,879
It's been a while.

2091
04:24:08,129 --> 04:24:09,409
No, not any video game.

2092
04:24:09,409 --> 04:24:12,610
I'm just saying just in general, like the genre.

2093
04:24:12,610 --> 04:24:16,690
It's been a while since the genre has had a game like this that I enjoyed.

2094
04:24:16,690 --> 04:24:19,860
That's good.

2095
04:24:20,420 --> 04:24:25,600
Well, I need a dash.

2096
04:24:26,959 --> 04:24:28,159
This is just safety.

2097
04:24:37,409 --> 04:24:37,909
Fish.

2098
04:24:39,010 --> 04:24:39,889
Play Transistor.

2099
04:24:39,889 --> 04:24:40,690
It's even better.

2100
04:24:40,690 --> 04:24:43,170
I was told that Transistor is not like this.

2101
04:24:44,049 --> 04:24:50,209
Is that correct?

2102
04:24:50,770 --> 04:24:59,780
See that shield break?

2103
04:24:59,780 --> 04:25:04,799
Transistor is not like this, but it's still very good.

2104
04:25:11,520 --> 04:25:12,719
A Cylastrocyon.

2105
04:25:13,520 --> 04:25:14,239
Cylastrocyon.

2106
04:25:14,239 --> 04:25:14,799
That's what I said.

2107
04:25:20,629 --> 04:25:22,870
The next boon you find has an upgraded rarity.

2108
04:25:22,870 --> 04:25:23,510
I like that.

2109
04:25:24,309 --> 04:25:38,739
Well, we're getting the key.

2110
04:25:42,079 --> 04:25:44,000
Given that one took you 50 tries.

2111
04:25:44,799 --> 04:25:47,840
Is that good?

2112
04:25:53,040 --> 04:25:53,600
That's great.

2113
04:25:56,790 --> 04:25:57,829
This game's good.

2114
04:25:57,829 --> 04:25:58,549
It's very good.

2115
04:25:59,110 --> 04:26:00,469
Hey, remember when I took a point up?

2116
04:26:00,950 --> 04:26:02,229
Maybe I went at a 91.

2117
04:26:03,280 --> 04:26:04,319
Oh, the point came back.

2118
04:26:04,959 --> 04:26:09,809
Plus two keys.

2119
04:26:10,370 --> 04:26:20,530
Is better fish?

2120
04:26:20,530 --> 04:26:21,409
Oh, that's cool.

2121
04:26:21,409 --> 04:26:30,879
Fists are cool.

2122
04:26:31,520 --> 04:26:41,399
You just absolutely shred people with the armor crusher.

2123
04:26:49,329 --> 04:26:51,409
I did Aphrodite last time and it didn't work out.

2124
04:27:06,790 --> 04:27:07,829
Look at that shred.

2125
04:27:08,469 --> 04:27:29,750
Nice.

2126
04:27:31,270 --> 04:27:32,069
250 damage.

2127
04:27:32,069 --> 04:27:32,549
That's pretty good.

2128
04:27:33,110 --> 04:27:36,979
See the urn?

2129
04:27:41,940 --> 04:27:44,579
Oh, I want to play this again.

2130
04:27:45,540 --> 04:27:47,459
I don't think I'm going to beat it tonight.

2131
04:27:47,459 --> 04:27:49,170
But I hope I'm going to play.

2132
04:27:49,170 --> 04:27:49,569
Here we go.

2133
04:27:49,569 --> 04:27:49,969
Here you go.

2134
04:27:49,969 --> 04:27:50,850
Ready?

2135
04:27:50,850 --> 04:27:51,729
Here's the plan.

2136
04:27:51,729 --> 04:27:54,579
Plan is tomorrow we're going to change it up.

2137
04:27:55,139 --> 04:27:56,959
Tomorrow's chat's choice.

2138
04:27:56,959 --> 04:27:58,450
I'm not done tonight.

2139
04:27:58,450 --> 04:27:58,930
I'm just saying.

2140
04:27:59,489 --> 04:28:01,010
Tomorrow's chat's choice.

2141
04:28:01,010 --> 04:28:03,409
So pre-stream chat tomorrow like an hour before the stream.

2142
04:28:03,409 --> 04:28:04,610
Somewhere around like two o'clock or so.

2143
04:28:04,610 --> 04:28:05,569
One to two o'clock.

2144
04:28:05,569 --> 04:28:07,219
We will play something else.

2145
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:12,659
Then after chat's choice tomorrow.

2146
04:28:12,659 --> 04:28:23,719
We're going to go back to this and I'm going to play this again.

2147
04:28:23,719 --> 04:28:25,159
Because I'm into it.

2148
04:28:25,159 --> 04:28:27,799
And it's been it's been a pretty long time since I've been into a game like this.

2149
04:28:27,799 --> 04:28:31,299
So I'm playing it.

2150
04:28:31,299 --> 04:28:31,860
He's addicted.

2151
04:28:31,860 --> 04:28:33,280
Yes, I am.

2152
04:28:33,280 --> 04:28:33,520
All right.

2153
04:28:33,520 --> 04:28:45,760
Should I get the cast?

2154
04:28:45,760 --> 04:28:49,700
Oh, that one.

2155
04:28:49,700 --> 04:28:50,899
And keys.

2156
04:28:54,159 --> 04:28:56,049
He doesn't like Noita.

2157
04:28:56,049 --> 04:28:57,010
No, I just I'm not.

2158
04:28:57,010 --> 04:28:59,010
I it couldn't it didn't click with me.

2159
04:29:01,760 --> 04:29:03,600
This skill based wise.

2160
04:29:03,600 --> 04:29:07,920
I was like you may as well just put a I've had a paper bag on my head that whole time.

2161
04:29:09,540 --> 04:29:14,819
That terraria style mouse kind of aiming keyboard side scrolling.

2162
04:29:14,819 --> 04:29:16,579
I'm not I'm not very good at it.

2163
04:29:17,459 --> 04:29:20,120
Let's get hit.

2164
04:29:20,920 --> 04:29:28,920
Is there an error here?

2165
04:29:31,780 --> 04:29:32,020
It is.

2166
04:29:32,659 --> 04:29:39,860
This game feels like right up my alley.

2167
04:29:39,860 --> 04:29:41,620
I just I like playing it.

2168
04:29:41,620 --> 04:29:44,879
That's not to say I didn't like playing Noita.

2169
04:29:49,540 --> 04:29:53,780
Just this is much more in my wheelhouse of video games that I like to play.

2170
04:29:53,780 --> 04:29:55,940
I only got two gigs of RAM.

2171
04:29:55,940 --> 04:29:56,659
That's punch.

2172
04:29:57,379 --> 04:30:00,000
Yeah, punch is like 200 megabytes.

2173
04:30:00,799 --> 04:30:04,319
Dash is probably 1000 megabytes because you need to get that correctly.

2174
04:30:05,489 --> 04:30:07,569
And then special is 200 megabytes.

2175
04:30:08,469 --> 04:30:09,270
And then move.

2176
04:30:09,270 --> 04:30:12,870
Don't get hit by stuff is another probably 800 megabytes.

2177
04:30:12,870 --> 04:30:19,280
If I may be so bold, your highness, I was wondering what brings you back around this way again.

2178
04:30:19,840 --> 04:30:20,959
Same story as last time.

2179
04:30:25,159 --> 04:30:26,360
He's out of space.

2180
04:30:29,159 --> 04:30:31,200
Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus.

2181
04:30:31,840 --> 04:30:34,360
I'm leaving the house quite enough.

2182
04:30:34,920 --> 04:30:35,479
You understand.

2183
04:30:35,479 --> 04:30:37,559
I'm sure I'm going to the surface.

2184
04:30:37,559 --> 04:30:38,200
Data leak.

2185
04:30:39,079 --> 04:30:42,120
Yeah, there's like some kind of acid leaking out of the motherboard.

2186
04:30:42,120 --> 04:30:46,280
If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told.

2187
04:30:46,280 --> 04:30:48,840
Though you're just mad enough to pull it off.

2188
04:30:48,840 --> 04:30:50,920
Oh, hey, I hope you make it.

2189
04:30:50,920 --> 04:30:51,879
Good fortune out there.

2190
04:30:56,469 --> 04:30:57,110
Okay.

2191
04:30:57,110 --> 04:31:00,760
Let's give him money.

2192
04:31:02,290 --> 04:31:02,770
Or no.

2193
04:31:03,729 --> 04:31:06,579
Yeah, give him money.

2194
04:31:06,579 --> 04:31:09,780
My dear.

2195
04:31:09,780 --> 04:31:10,420
Cheers, mate.

2196
04:31:11,219 --> 04:31:12,180
I have any.

2197
04:31:12,180 --> 04:31:12,819
Can I gift you?

2198
04:31:14,280 --> 04:31:22,930
That's it.

2199
04:31:24,049 --> 04:31:26,719
I don't have any nectar.

2200
04:31:26,719 --> 04:31:27,920
Oh, that's too bad.

2201
04:31:27,920 --> 04:31:29,120
What is it now?

2202
04:31:29,120 --> 04:31:32,000
Let's see your relatives upon Olympus get you out of this.

2203
04:31:33,120 --> 04:31:36,709
Survive for 45 seconds.

2204
04:31:37,590 --> 04:31:47,479
That move is so good.

2205
04:31:48,200 --> 04:31:50,040
Hope I can upgrade that move, too.

2206
04:31:50,040 --> 04:31:50,760
That's the best part.

2207
04:31:51,559 --> 04:32:17,989
Lightning, lightning, lightning.

2208
04:32:17,989 --> 04:32:22,229
Five, four, three, two, one, kill them.

2209
04:32:23,430 --> 04:32:24,069
That's enough.

2210
04:32:24,709 --> 04:32:26,260
Peace and quiet.

2211
04:32:26,260 --> 04:32:29,780
From a quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

2212
04:32:30,340 --> 04:32:32,549
What is that?

2213
04:32:35,110 --> 04:32:35,829
Is that a lizard?

2214
04:32:36,790 --> 04:32:41,079
It's a lizard.

2215
04:32:41,719 --> 04:32:48,309
That's a pretty cool lizard.

2216
04:32:53,030 --> 04:32:54,309
Wait, what day is it today?

2217
04:32:57,379 --> 04:32:59,680
This is October?

2218
04:32:59,680 --> 04:33:00,959
Oh, no, it's November.

2219
04:33:00,959 --> 04:33:03,799
Oh, oh, shit, look at this.

2220
04:33:09,830 --> 04:33:11,430
Lizard of days past.

2221
04:33:19,520 --> 04:33:20,159
That's a cool lizard.

2222
04:33:22,580 --> 04:33:23,540
Or Gecko.

2223
04:33:27,189 --> 04:33:28,229
That's just level two.

2224
04:33:29,270 --> 04:33:30,979
Probably three.

2225
04:33:31,540 --> 04:33:33,000
Three or one.

2226
04:33:42,200 --> 04:33:42,439
Two?

2227
04:33:43,080 --> 04:33:47,360
Three is more damage than all of them.

2228
04:33:47,360 --> 04:33:48,560
Oh, I guess because it's a double.

2229
04:33:48,560 --> 04:33:49,040
Right, I forgot.

2230
04:33:49,040 --> 04:33:49,840
I can dash twice.

2231
04:33:50,560 --> 04:34:04,790
So far, so good.

2232
04:34:05,349 --> 04:34:06,310
Let's just hope it scales.

2233
04:34:15,880 --> 04:34:17,540
We should play Gex tomorrow.

2234
04:34:17,540 --> 04:34:19,139
I played Gex already and it was dog shit.

2235
04:34:19,860 --> 04:34:20,340
Oops.

2236
04:34:20,340 --> 04:34:22,259
I should, I, all right, you can tell I'm a little...

2237
04:34:24,099 --> 04:34:24,740
It was okay.

2238
04:34:25,700 --> 04:34:26,659
It was good.

2239
04:34:26,659 --> 04:34:27,459
It was good.

2240
04:34:27,459 --> 04:34:28,180
It was good.

2241
04:34:29,060 --> 04:34:29,939
It was good.

2242
04:34:30,580 --> 04:34:32,709
Hi, Mies.

2243
04:34:32,709 --> 04:34:34,150
Kind of swiftness, travel,

2244
04:34:34,150 --> 04:34:36,310
bringing souls of the departed to your boat.

2245
04:34:36,310 --> 04:34:36,630
Whatever.

2246
04:34:36,630 --> 04:34:38,229
He calls you his professional associate.

2247
04:34:38,790 --> 04:34:41,430
You and he, you've been working together for a while, haven't you?

2248
04:34:42,150 --> 04:34:45,000
He's high?

2249
04:34:45,000 --> 04:34:45,560
No, I'm not.

2250
04:34:49,779 --> 04:34:50,500
Well, I can get it all.

2251
04:34:50,500 --> 04:34:50,979
Take it all.

2252
04:34:51,540 --> 04:34:54,180
Take this one.

2253
04:34:54,180 --> 04:34:54,819
Aphrodite.

2254
04:35:00,389 --> 04:35:01,029
Aphrodite.

2255
04:35:02,389 --> 04:35:03,990
I want to give you more gifts.

2256
04:35:03,990 --> 04:35:05,590
I want, you, you can be,

2257
04:35:05,590 --> 04:35:06,709
there's romance in this game?

2258
04:35:07,750 --> 04:35:11,409
That's good.

2259
04:35:12,130 --> 04:35:14,439
Wait, Aphrodite's call.

2260
04:35:15,159 --> 04:35:21,569
Your call fire is a seeking projectile that inflicts charm.

2261
04:35:22,130 --> 04:35:24,610
For a short time, the victim fights for you

2262
04:35:24,610 --> 04:35:26,209
with greater strength and speed.

2263
04:35:28,200 --> 04:35:33,889
Oh, this thing is 200, 2500 damage?

2264
04:35:34,529 --> 04:35:39,189
Does it work on bosses?

2265
04:35:39,830 --> 04:35:45,909
It does.

2266
04:35:48,950 --> 04:35:51,430
This is almost too good to ignore though.

2267
04:35:51,990 --> 04:35:55,799
But I'm going to make the wrong call

2268
04:35:55,799 --> 04:35:56,520
and I'm going to get the call.

2269
04:36:10,279 --> 04:36:11,639
Damage is only if it's max.

2270
04:36:13,639 --> 04:36:16,680
Yeah, but how much more strength and damage do they do?

2271
04:36:16,680 --> 04:36:18,599
Says when they're charmed, they do more damage, right?

2272
04:36:25,729 --> 04:36:26,209
Shitload.

2273
04:36:26,770 --> 04:36:30,979
After using call, gain dodge, chance,

2274
04:36:30,979 --> 04:36:32,259
dodge chance, and move speed.

2275
04:36:36,479 --> 04:36:39,599
After you dash, briefly become sturdy and move 100% faster.

2276
04:36:40,799 --> 04:36:41,759
Yeah, it's that one.

2277
04:36:42,560 --> 04:36:56,130
It's not very long though, is it?

2278
04:36:56,770 --> 04:37:02,470
All right, let's go kill Meg for like a thousandth time.

2279
04:37:08,840 --> 04:37:10,340
She's different.

2280
04:37:10,900 --> 04:37:15,009
What is this?

2281
04:37:30,689 --> 04:37:32,209
Is this Tissyphone?

2282
04:37:32,770 --> 04:37:34,450
Not Meg anymore?

2283
04:37:37,540 --> 04:37:39,060
Is it because I killed Meg too many times?

2284
04:37:51,970 --> 04:37:52,529
Well, let's go.

2285
04:37:53,409 --> 04:37:55,479
We have a new moveset too.

2286
04:37:56,040 --> 04:38:03,759
Is it poison?

2287
04:38:04,479 --> 04:38:05,459
Looks like poison.

2288
04:38:06,340 --> 04:38:07,459
Is there a poison cure here?

2289
04:38:13,110 --> 04:38:17,509
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2290
04:38:17,509 --> 04:38:18,950
Why do I have hard Meg?

2291
04:38:18,950 --> 04:38:20,630
I don't want to fight hard Meg.

2292
04:38:20,630 --> 04:38:22,630
I want the easy Meg that I kill easily.

2293
04:38:23,509 --> 04:38:29,009
Oh, she's my friend.

2294
04:38:43,680 --> 04:38:46,450
Oh, we have a new moveset.

2295
04:38:46,450 --> 04:38:47,330
This is not fair.

2296
04:38:47,330 --> 04:38:47,970
I don't know what the hell.

2297
04:38:57,490 --> 04:38:58,290
What?

2298
04:38:58,290 --> 04:39:00,979
What the hell's going on?

2299
04:39:09,380 --> 04:39:10,340
Beat her up while she's charmed.

2300
04:39:11,779 --> 04:39:27,409
Oh, it kind of works.

2301
04:39:41,919 --> 04:39:42,720
Well, where'd you go?

2302
04:39:43,520 --> 04:39:44,000
There you are.

2303
04:39:53,349 --> 04:39:54,630
Oh, fuck you, Tissyphone.

2304
04:40:03,619 --> 04:40:04,819
What the fuck?

2305
04:40:04,819 --> 04:40:06,340
What the hell is going on here?

2306
04:40:07,380 --> 04:40:11,220
This is such a shitty area to fight somebody.

2307
04:40:26,930 --> 04:40:28,529
Why are you so much harder than the other one?

2308
04:40:30,479 --> 04:40:31,119
What?

2309
04:40:31,119 --> 04:40:31,599
I'm dead?

2310
04:40:32,319 --> 04:40:41,830
Well, that was unexpected.

2311
04:41:04,150 --> 04:41:05,110
The symphony.

2312
04:41:15,090 --> 04:41:16,290
Can't beat Tissyphone.

2313
04:41:18,689 --> 04:41:22,880
This is where I pick grenade up.

2314
04:41:22,880 --> 04:41:24,639
Put grenade in my phone pin.

2315
04:41:25,959 --> 04:41:27,560
Just lob it over there and just go like this.

2316
04:41:33,159 --> 04:41:33,959
New stuff, hold on.

2317
04:41:42,470 --> 04:41:44,150
Now, if only Twitch would do this.

2318
04:41:44,150 --> 04:41:44,869
That would be great.

2319
04:41:56,159 --> 04:42:02,020
This musician need not be so indulged.

2320
04:42:02,020 --> 04:42:04,419
Oh, so what does it do?

2321
04:42:04,419 --> 04:42:05,540
You are home.

2322
04:42:05,540 --> 04:42:06,790
Listen.

2323
04:42:06,790 --> 04:42:07,590
Some new music.

2324
04:42:08,389 --> 04:42:15,560
Does it spend a diamond on the sound test options menu?

2325
04:42:16,119 --> 04:42:24,470
I don't have two.

2326
04:42:26,580 --> 04:42:31,540
Nix, sometimes I get the impression the Olympians look down on those of us born at the Underworld.

2327
04:42:31,540 --> 04:42:34,099
Is that my imagination or what do you make of it?

2328
04:42:34,099 --> 04:42:40,310
Gods of Mount Olympus tend to think themselves above us, child.

2329
04:42:40,950 --> 04:42:42,709
Or so your father often likes to say.

2330
04:42:42,709 --> 04:42:44,709
You have to buy the rest for more diamonds.

2331
04:42:46,720 --> 04:42:58,369
Well, there's your end game, Sync.

2332
04:42:58,369 --> 04:42:59,490
Anything new in here?

2333
04:42:59,490 --> 04:43:00,130
Yes, there is.

2334
04:43:00,130 --> 04:43:00,610
What do you got?

2335
04:43:01,250 --> 04:43:02,659
Here's what I caught.

2336
04:43:04,720 --> 04:43:05,360
30 bucks.

2337
04:43:06,159 --> 04:43:08,520
I think that's worth 100.

2338
04:43:10,279 --> 04:43:15,919
How many keys do I have?

2339
04:43:17,959 --> 04:43:19,560
Okay, I need to buy.

2340
04:43:32,259 --> 04:43:33,939
Ambers may contain 10 gold.

2341
04:43:34,500 --> 04:43:37,779
What a waste of 60 gems unless that's the final thing you ever upgrade.

2342
04:43:38,500 --> 04:43:41,040
I need keys.

2343
04:43:41,759 --> 04:43:51,750
Too good to pass up.

2344
04:43:56,479 --> 04:43:59,040
Somebody said you need to feed her some bug snacks.

2345
04:43:59,680 --> 04:44:09,110
There she goes again.

2346
04:44:09,750 --> 04:44:11,409
I'm gonna get out of here.

2347
04:44:11,409 --> 04:44:13,409
Go back to, go back to Undertale, Temmie.

2348
04:44:43,700 --> 04:44:45,060
I just almost ended my stream.

2349
04:45:27,400 --> 04:45:29,490
I need four more keys.

2350
04:45:29,490 --> 04:45:33,490
Thanks.

2351
04:45:33,490 --> 04:45:34,369
Achilles or Riot?

2352
04:45:34,369 --> 04:45:35,090
Achilles or Riot?

2353
04:45:35,090 --> 04:45:35,810
I don't know where he is.

2354
04:45:35,810 --> 04:45:36,849
Where's Achilles?

2355
04:45:36,849 --> 04:45:37,810
Where is he?

2356
04:45:37,810 --> 04:45:39,569
He's not in his usual hiding place.

2357
04:45:41,540 --> 04:45:42,659
Oh, there he is.

2358
04:45:42,659 --> 04:45:46,500
You're much too modest, Lord Achilles, for someone with such a number of heroic deeds

2359
04:45:46,500 --> 04:45:48,580
and glorious decapitations to his name.

2360
04:45:49,220 --> 04:45:52,340
You ought to be more like ever boastful Sagrius and talk it up some more.

2361
04:45:52,979 --> 04:45:56,799
Oh, fear not, Orpheus.

2362
04:45:56,799 --> 04:45:58,319
I was quite boastful of my day.

2363
04:45:59,119 --> 04:46:00,400
Would you look at where it got me?

2364
04:46:01,360 --> 04:46:05,200
Besides, I've not the imagination to come up with tails as tall as those of Achilles.

2365
04:46:05,200 --> 04:46:07,279
Achilles or we Trojan horse you?

2366
04:46:08,000 --> 04:46:13,860
So you're all gonna deliver a horsey to my house and go in it?

2367
04:46:16,209 --> 04:46:19,250
And then I'm gonna open the door and you guys are gonna all come in and murder me?

2368
04:46:19,970 --> 04:46:23,810
Okay.

2369
04:46:23,810 --> 04:46:24,610
Well, I'm here.

2370
04:46:25,330 --> 04:46:29,799
I'm talking to Achilles.

2371
04:46:30,439 --> 04:46:34,130
Ow.

2372
04:46:34,130 --> 04:46:34,610
I'm sorry.

2373
04:46:35,250 --> 04:46:37,029
All right.

2374
04:46:37,029 --> 04:46:37,909
Achilles or riot.

2375
04:46:39,700 --> 04:46:40,099
We did it.

2376
04:46:40,099 --> 04:46:40,500
No use.

2377
04:46:42,869 --> 04:46:53,139
Talk to dad.

2378
04:46:53,939 --> 04:46:56,790
So tell me something, father, if you please.

2379
04:46:56,790 --> 04:47:00,150
Since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here and all.

2380
04:47:00,709 --> 04:47:02,790
Did you and mother how to put this?

2381
04:47:03,430 --> 04:47:05,360
Any brothers or sisters I should know about?

2382
04:47:07,409 --> 04:47:10,049
I thought I told you never to invoke her here.

2383
04:47:10,049 --> 04:47:12,759
Bastard kin.

2384
04:47:13,560 --> 04:47:16,119
It was like a ace attorney.

2385
04:47:16,759 --> 04:47:19,560
Why would you think I'd risk another such as you?

2386
04:47:19,560 --> 04:47:23,240
Sure.

2387
04:47:23,240 --> 04:47:24,119
That's fair enough.

2388
04:47:24,119 --> 04:47:26,360
It's just not all such things occur.

2389
04:47:26,360 --> 04:47:27,880
I almost said attorney's law.

2390
04:47:27,880 --> 04:47:29,639
From tales of your brothers and so forth.

2391
04:47:31,729 --> 04:47:35,189
Blast to my brothers and blast you as well.

2392
04:47:35,189 --> 04:47:38,229
All those who know me know I have no heir.

2393
04:47:38,229 --> 04:47:40,849
You could not rise to the occasion if you tried.

2394
04:47:41,729 --> 04:47:43,250
And there is no one else.

2395
04:47:44,049 --> 04:47:56,319
You have only me and I have only.

2396
04:47:56,319 --> 04:47:59,520
Those these expensive gems and stuff down here.

2397
04:48:00,639 --> 04:48:02,020
But what do you buy with it?

2398
04:48:04,340 --> 04:48:06,819
This is one weird ghost to the trade.

2399
04:48:09,299 --> 04:48:10,580
What do you even buy with this stuff?

2400
04:48:11,220 --> 04:48:16,549
Look at all these gems and jewels.

2401
04:48:16,549 --> 04:48:17,830
I mean, there's no Denny's here.

2402
04:48:18,470 --> 04:48:21,619
There's no mall.

2403
04:48:21,619 --> 04:48:24,099
What are you supposed to do with this money?

2404
04:48:29,119 --> 04:48:31,970
Gotta say, you're really getting somewhere, boy.

2405
04:48:31,970 --> 04:48:33,490
Oh, I'm pretty impressed here.

2406
04:48:33,490 --> 04:48:34,849
And they don't even pay me to do that.

2407
04:48:34,849 --> 04:48:35,970
I'm just supposed to stand around.

2408
04:48:35,970 --> 04:48:38,849
Paying for the Denny's breakfast combo with gems.

2409
04:48:40,819 --> 04:48:41,319
Yeah.

2410
04:48:41,860 --> 04:48:43,729
What else are you going to do with this stuff?

2411
04:48:43,729 --> 04:48:45,169
He's wearing it all over him.

2412
04:48:47,729 --> 04:48:50,529
And money doesn't really have value anymore, guys, when you have a belt.

2413
04:48:51,330 --> 04:48:54,290
That the belt buckle is a golden jeweled skull.

2414
04:48:54,290 --> 04:48:58,529
And inside of the skull's mouth is other skull jeweled rubies and stuff.

2415
04:48:59,169 --> 04:49:01,569
He's wearing a championship belt of money.

2416
04:49:02,130 --> 04:49:05,400
He doesn't really think he cares about gems anymore.

2417
04:49:14,119 --> 04:49:20,610
It's a decoration.

2418
04:49:30,069 --> 04:49:32,520
Oh, this is a gun.

2419
04:49:35,319 --> 04:49:36,599
That's a Falco gun.

2420
04:49:36,599 --> 04:49:37,240
What is that?

2421
04:49:37,799 --> 04:49:40,119
It's eight.

2422
04:49:40,119 --> 04:49:42,759
Oh, I need to get it right now.

2423
04:49:42,759 --> 04:49:43,639
I want it now.

2424
04:49:44,439 --> 04:49:52,560
Let's see here.

2425
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:53,119
Oh, right.

2426
04:49:53,119 --> 04:49:55,040
I died because I threw at the end there.

2427
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:55,279
All right.

2428
04:49:55,279 --> 04:49:56,479
I'm going to keep the purse on.

2429
04:49:57,119 --> 04:50:00,959
But we're going up.

2430
04:50:00,959 --> 04:50:17,439
Oh, time.

2431
04:50:17,439 --> 04:50:23,270
My first win was with the gun.

2432
04:50:30,759 --> 04:50:31,319
That works.

2433
04:50:32,790 --> 04:50:33,349
That works.

2434
04:50:37,459 --> 04:50:39,380
What is the explosive shot?

2435
04:50:40,099 --> 04:50:47,779
It takes us such a long time.

2436
04:50:48,340 --> 04:50:54,099
Does the explosion hurt me?

2437
04:50:54,659 --> 04:50:55,540
Let's find out.

2438
04:50:56,180 --> 04:50:58,209
It doesn't.

2439
04:50:58,209 --> 04:50:58,709
Okay.

2440
04:50:59,409 --> 04:51:01,729
I gotta get that timing right.

2441
04:51:02,610 --> 04:51:11,569
300% damage is insane.

2442
04:51:11,569 --> 04:51:12,069
Yeah.

2443
04:51:12,369 --> 04:51:15,569
I don't care how long it takes.

2444
04:51:16,290 --> 04:51:21,759
The bosses, though.

2445
04:51:22,880 --> 04:51:24,479
Oh, this might not be very good.

2446
04:51:25,119 --> 04:51:33,720
If I get chaos with this, then.

2447
04:51:33,720 --> 04:51:34,680
Somebody said chaos?

2448
04:51:38,099 --> 04:51:38,419
All right.

2449
04:51:38,419 --> 04:51:39,220
This is important.

2450
04:51:39,779 --> 04:51:43,110
This is really important.

2451
04:51:44,259 --> 04:51:48,900
If I can get this to be insane, this could be huge.

2452
04:52:04,580 --> 04:52:05,700
Let's look over at the image.

2453
04:52:07,220 --> 04:52:08,900
All your attacks lose 50% damage,

2454
04:52:08,900 --> 04:52:10,099
but you get a slice of bologna.

2455
04:52:10,099 --> 04:52:11,459
It's just still on my other monitor.

2456
04:52:12,180 --> 04:52:26,549
I mean, it's one.

2457
04:52:27,430 --> 04:52:31,720
Can't earn money.

2458
04:52:31,720 --> 04:52:32,279
Who cares?

2459
04:52:33,000 --> 04:52:40,759
This is the run.

2460
04:52:40,759 --> 04:52:41,400
Don't throw.

2461
04:52:42,439 --> 04:52:43,080
I'm going to try.

2462
04:52:56,200 --> 04:52:57,240
Don't need a full charge.

2463
04:52:57,240 --> 04:52:58,520
That's important to understand here.

2464
04:52:59,319 --> 04:53:00,680
Full charge is not even necessary.

2465
04:53:01,319 --> 04:53:03,509
Just land it.

2466
04:53:03,509 --> 04:53:26,900
200.

2467
04:53:27,540 --> 04:53:33,110
I love the charge sound.

2468
04:53:33,669 --> 04:53:52,759
Like, I got hurt?

2469
04:53:52,759 --> 04:53:53,799
How would I get hurt by?

2470
04:53:53,799 --> 04:53:59,139
I don't have enough to wait.

2471
04:53:59,779 --> 04:54:01,139
I can get the health upgrade.

2472
04:54:01,139 --> 04:54:02,259
Wait, is it another chaos?

2473
04:54:02,900 --> 04:54:03,860
Did I miss a chaos?

2474
04:54:04,740 --> 04:54:05,220
Shut up.

2475
04:54:05,779 --> 04:54:06,580
No, I didn't.

2476
04:54:06,580 --> 04:54:06,979
Did I?

2477
04:54:11,439 --> 04:54:11,680
No.

2478
04:54:11,680 --> 04:54:12,240
Oh, my God.

2479
04:54:12,240 --> 04:54:13,840
You scared me so much.

2480
04:54:13,840 --> 04:54:15,919
Oh, my chest is on fire.

2481
04:54:30,840 --> 04:54:32,040
Guys, I don't understand.

2482
04:54:33,619 --> 04:54:34,740
I don't know what's happening to me.

2483
04:54:39,360 --> 04:54:39,759
Stop it.

2484
04:54:40,560 --> 04:54:41,439
I got to relax.

2485
04:54:41,439 --> 04:54:41,759
Thank you.

2486
04:54:57,729 --> 04:54:59,009
This is really awesome.

2487
04:54:59,569 --> 04:55:01,540
Just need a ton more damage on this.

2488
04:55:02,180 --> 04:55:03,619
And this will be unbeatable.

2489
04:55:12,040 --> 04:55:13,319
The timing is a little weird, though.

2490
04:55:13,319 --> 04:55:14,040
Oh, come on.

2491
04:55:14,040 --> 04:55:14,360
Really?

2492
04:55:19,240 --> 04:55:24,080
Hey, Artemis of the blue.

2493
04:55:25,439 --> 04:55:26,639
You're of the grain in this game,

2494
04:55:26,639 --> 04:55:27,680
but thank you for the five subs.

2495
04:55:38,119 --> 04:55:39,720
Okay, your special is hangover,

2496
04:55:39,720 --> 04:55:41,000
which I like,

2497
04:55:41,560 --> 04:55:43,479
because I can just kind of fan that.

2498
04:55:44,119 --> 04:55:46,240
The cast lobs a large explosive

2499
04:55:46,240 --> 04:55:47,840
that bursts into festive fog.

2500
04:55:47,840 --> 04:55:50,630
This is just a stun.

2501
04:55:52,130 --> 04:55:53,569
Yeah, let me try that.

2502
04:55:53,569 --> 04:55:54,369
To my health.

2503
04:55:54,369 --> 04:55:57,200
It's a very long cast.

2504
04:55:58,080 --> 04:55:58,720
It hurts me.

2505
04:55:59,279 --> 04:56:00,369
Okay, no, it doesn't.

2506
04:56:00,930 --> 04:56:03,459
And aim it.

2507
04:56:04,099 --> 04:56:08,930
Okay, that's not bad.

2508
04:56:09,970 --> 04:56:12,209
And when they're stunned, I can blow them up.

2509
04:56:13,139 --> 04:56:13,779
That's great.

2510
04:56:14,340 --> 04:56:15,299
That works out pretty well.

2511
04:56:16,709 --> 04:56:17,110
More health.

2512
04:56:27,330 --> 04:56:27,650
Thank you.

2513
04:56:27,650 --> 04:56:27,889
Thank you.

2514
04:56:27,889 --> 04:56:28,209
Thank you.

2515
04:56:28,209 --> 04:56:28,450
Thank you.

2516
04:56:28,450 --> 04:56:29,250
Any fish?

2517
04:56:29,250 --> 04:56:34,930
Do not see fish.

2518
04:56:38,229 --> 04:57:01,040
That actually works really not.

2519
04:57:01,040 --> 04:57:01,520
It's all right.

2520
04:57:02,080 --> 04:57:15,080
Oh, yeah, the bow is great.

2521
04:57:15,080 --> 04:57:16,279
Bow and shield are my favorites.

2522
04:57:16,919 --> 04:57:26,389
Defeater.

2523
04:57:31,669 --> 04:57:32,709
Defeater boons.

2524
04:57:32,709 --> 04:57:33,029
Puke.

2525
04:57:48,720 --> 04:57:52,290
So this is a good combo here,

2526
04:57:52,290 --> 04:57:55,360
because you can,

2527
04:57:56,319 --> 04:57:59,830
I could do that and the stun

2528
04:57:59,830 --> 04:58:00,709
and then blow them all up.

2529
04:58:01,349 --> 04:58:09,650
So it's like you go wham, wham, boom.

2530
04:58:10,369 --> 04:58:18,639
Or you go wham, wham, boom.

2531
04:58:18,639 --> 04:58:25,970
Remember, I just watched a TikTok

2532
04:58:25,970 --> 04:58:27,569
of somebody making soap.

2533
04:58:28,130 --> 04:58:29,639
Probably cool.

2534
04:58:29,639 --> 04:58:31,750
I don't know.

2535
04:58:31,750 --> 04:58:33,430
The ACDC freak gave five subs.

2536
04:58:33,430 --> 04:58:34,470
Thank you, ACDC freak.

2537
04:58:34,470 --> 04:58:35,590
Didn't they just come up with a new album?

2538
04:58:36,389 --> 04:58:40,659
Didn't ACDC just release a new album?

2539
04:58:41,220 --> 04:58:49,009
And it's good.

2540
04:58:49,970 --> 04:58:52,290
Don't they sound exactly the same, too?

2541
04:58:52,290 --> 04:58:56,279
They haven't changed at all.

2542
04:58:56,279 --> 04:59:03,119
How do they still sound the same?

2543
04:59:03,119 --> 04:59:04,319
Aren't they 80?

2544
04:59:04,319 --> 04:59:13,520
It's pretty good.

2545
04:59:29,830 --> 04:59:30,229
It's good.

2546
04:59:30,869 --> 04:59:44,310
It's very good.

2547
04:59:47,240 --> 04:59:48,119
There's a chest in here, too.

2548
04:59:48,119 --> 04:59:48,840
Don't let me forget that.

2549
05:00:03,439 --> 05:00:10,500
10.

2550
05:00:10,500 --> 05:00:13,939
This chest is for up to 100 gold.

2551
05:00:15,939 --> 05:00:16,900
Just combo the hell out of me.

2552
05:00:16,900 --> 05:00:19,970
Transgressions are not tolerable.

2553
05:00:19,970 --> 05:00:21,009
Slay foes quickly.

2554
05:00:21,729 --> 05:00:41,479
Oh, I could have killed them

2555
05:00:41,479 --> 05:00:42,360
that much faster than that.

2556
05:00:42,360 --> 05:00:48,599
Who's going to clean all this up?

2557
05:00:48,599 --> 05:00:49,720
You have to have an insane build

2558
05:00:49,720 --> 05:00:51,319
to be able to kill things in a second.

2559
05:00:52,360 --> 05:00:55,720
Missed anything?

2560
05:01:00,900 --> 05:01:01,540
Me, me, me.

2561
05:01:01,540 --> 05:01:02,020
What are you doing?

2562
05:01:09,669 --> 05:01:10,310
Survive.

2563
05:01:10,310 --> 05:01:10,709
Uh-oh.

2564
05:01:10,709 --> 05:01:23,279
Come on, then.

2565
05:01:23,279 --> 05:01:24,000
I have the explosive.

2566
05:01:24,000 --> 05:01:24,319
I'm good.

2567
05:01:24,880 --> 05:01:33,650
Just keep him on that bridge.

2568
05:01:34,369 --> 05:01:44,369
Oh, shit.

2569
05:01:44,369 --> 05:01:44,770
Watch out.

2570
05:01:47,409 --> 05:01:48,849
Oh, right at the end, really.

2571
05:01:49,490 --> 05:01:50,840
It's a good strategy, too.

2572
05:01:51,560 --> 05:01:58,959
That's that.

2573
05:01:58,959 --> 05:02:00,630
Did I get to the final boss yet?

2574
05:02:00,630 --> 05:02:01,110
Yes.

2575
05:02:01,110 --> 05:02:01,909
A couple of times.

2576
05:02:04,080 --> 05:02:05,599
I've gotten the final...

2577
05:02:05,599 --> 05:02:06,959
Well, I don't know if it's the final boss,

2578
05:02:06,959 --> 05:02:07,759
but I've gotten the...

2579
05:02:08,400 --> 05:02:09,680
I got the final boss

2580
05:02:10,479 --> 05:02:11,840
of the story mode or whatever

2581
05:02:12,560 --> 05:02:13,919
down to the second phase.

2582
05:02:15,360 --> 05:02:18,340
One more key gets me a gun.

2583
05:02:18,979 --> 05:02:19,380
It does.

2584
05:02:20,869 --> 05:02:22,159
What's for sale?

2585
05:02:24,069 --> 05:02:27,880
I want that.

2586
05:02:28,439 --> 05:02:38,310
300 damage.

2587
05:02:38,310 --> 05:02:39,520
Tringers.

2588
05:02:39,520 --> 05:02:40,000
Tringers?

2589
05:02:40,639 --> 05:02:43,000
Oh, shit.

2590
05:02:43,000 --> 05:02:44,680
For a second, I thought I had a different move.

2591
05:02:45,319 --> 05:03:03,880
What's it hitting?

2592
05:03:03,880 --> 05:03:05,240
Where's the treasure trove?

2593
05:03:05,240 --> 05:03:08,400
Did they say the treasure trove was going to spawn?

2594
05:03:08,400 --> 05:03:10,340
I don't see a treasure.

2595
05:03:10,340 --> 05:03:10,819
Oh, I do.

2596
05:03:11,459 --> 05:03:12,689
100 gold.

2597
05:03:12,689 --> 05:03:13,090
Let's go.

2598
05:03:13,729 --> 05:03:16,040
Give me a good spawn.

2599
05:03:16,040 --> 05:03:18,520
You truly are an idiot, aren't you?

2600
05:03:21,479 --> 05:03:35,590
Die.

2601
05:03:38,450 --> 05:03:39,169
71.

2602
05:03:40,740 --> 05:03:43,540
What did I just get?

2603
05:03:44,819 --> 05:03:45,779
20 gold return.

2604
05:03:53,889 --> 05:03:54,930
21 gold return.

2605
05:03:56,479 --> 05:03:58,159
And I lost five health or something.

2606
05:03:58,159 --> 05:03:59,119
Not worth it.

2607
05:03:59,119 --> 05:04:09,970
Use this.

2608
05:04:09,970 --> 05:04:11,720
If you dash shoots a gust,

2609
05:04:12,520 --> 05:04:15,479
10 stacks of chill cause a blast clearing the effect.

2610
05:04:16,040 --> 05:04:17,479
While all foals are chilled,

2611
05:04:23,799 --> 05:04:25,560
they are 10% slower and decayed.

2612
05:04:26,119 --> 05:04:29,250
K damage.

2613
05:04:30,180 --> 05:04:30,659
So I just...

2614
05:04:31,380 --> 05:04:32,790
And they all get chilled anyways.

2615
05:04:33,349 --> 05:04:34,659
Sounds good.

2616
05:04:38,709 --> 05:04:44,840
It just adds to the potential.

2617
05:04:46,599 --> 05:04:46,840
All right.

2618
05:04:46,840 --> 05:04:53,110
Am I going to get the harder mech again?

2619
05:04:53,909 --> 05:05:03,439
Damn.

2620
05:05:03,439 --> 05:05:03,919
Wait.

2621
05:05:03,919 --> 05:05:04,880
This is a different mech.

2622
05:05:07,520 --> 05:05:09,250
How many mechs are there?

2623
05:05:24,229 --> 05:05:25,990
Somebody said step on me.

2624
05:05:37,459 --> 05:05:42,799
First thing you write.

2625
05:05:43,750 --> 05:05:43,990
It's just...

2626
05:05:46,099 --> 05:05:47,299
Oh, who's this new god?

2627
05:05:47,299 --> 05:05:48,259
Who's this new character?

2628
05:05:48,259 --> 05:05:48,740
Oh, I don't know.

2629
05:05:48,740 --> 05:05:49,380
Step on me.

2630
05:05:49,939 --> 05:05:59,400
What's this rage?

2631
05:05:59,400 --> 05:06:00,520
She's got a rage meter?

2632
05:06:01,479 --> 05:06:07,200
What exactly does that mean?

2633
05:06:18,689 --> 05:06:20,529
Well, you're not nearly as bad as the other one.

2634
05:06:21,250 --> 05:06:25,759
Can I stop her from doing that?

2635
05:06:26,400 --> 05:06:48,180
She's impervious.

2636
05:07:01,349 --> 05:07:02,790
These traps have blended in with the ground.

2637
05:07:02,790 --> 05:07:03,830
They're the same...

2638
05:07:03,830 --> 05:07:07,669
I've only taken damage from the fucking traps on the ground.

2639
05:07:16,069 --> 05:07:18,630
I was stepping on the area that was...

2640
05:07:18,950 --> 05:07:20,790
I was avoiding the actual ground.

2641
05:07:30,840 --> 05:07:31,400
I got plenty of health.

2642
05:07:31,400 --> 05:07:31,959
I'm fine.

2643
05:07:31,959 --> 05:07:34,080
Good build.

2644
05:07:34,080 --> 05:07:38,840
I'm going to step on me.

2645
05:07:38,840 --> 05:07:54,680
Can I ask you guys what element I was?

2646
05:07:54,680 --> 05:07:56,610
What element am I?

2647
05:07:56,610 --> 05:07:57,650
I know what animal I am.

2648
05:07:57,650 --> 05:08:02,099
One of those fucking parrots that you see at the pet store.

2649
05:08:02,099 --> 05:08:07,240
Not even the cool one.

2650
05:08:07,240 --> 05:08:13,189
The one that just yells out the thing that you just said.

2651
05:08:13,189 --> 05:08:25,240
Like a parakeet.

2652
05:08:25,240 --> 05:08:26,599
Yeah, it makes sense, right?

2653
05:08:26,599 --> 05:08:29,680
Look at half of my mannerisms.

2654
05:08:29,680 --> 05:08:33,779
Just like, step on me, bro.

2655
05:08:33,779 --> 05:08:41,119
Just say the shit that you're writing.

2656
05:08:41,119 --> 05:08:45,799
Figured it out.

2657
05:08:45,799 --> 05:08:54,919
All right.

2658
05:08:54,919 --> 05:08:56,599
It's time to change to...

2659
05:08:57,240 --> 05:08:59,139
I feel like this is a good run, though.

2660
05:09:00,099 --> 05:09:01,619
The meta is too good.

2661
05:09:01,619 --> 05:09:03,380
The run is too good.

2662
05:09:03,380 --> 05:09:04,580
I can't change it.

2663
05:09:04,580 --> 05:09:07,169
Don't stop hating yourself.

2664
05:09:07,169 --> 05:09:07,889
I don't hate myself.

2665
05:09:07,889 --> 05:09:09,009
Parrots are incredibly intelligent.

2666
05:09:09,009 --> 05:09:10,610
They're really cool and they're really fun.

2667
05:09:10,610 --> 05:09:13,220
I didn't say parrots were stupid.

2668
05:09:13,220 --> 05:09:13,700
They're bad.

2669
05:09:14,500 --> 05:09:26,340
I'm keeping the tooth on.

2670
05:09:26,340 --> 05:09:26,979
This run's good.

2671
05:09:28,259 --> 05:09:41,779
If it's going to happen tonight, it's going to happen right now.

2672
05:09:41,779 --> 05:09:42,500
Why is it locked?

2673
05:09:43,750 --> 05:09:44,950
Let me back in there.

2674
05:09:44,950 --> 05:09:45,590
Let me back in there.

2675
05:09:45,590 --> 05:09:46,229
Let me back in there.

2676
05:09:46,869 --> 05:09:49,279
They lock it after you equip something?

2677
05:09:53,729 --> 05:09:54,529
That's unfortunate.

2678
05:09:55,169 --> 05:10:10,209
What up, my fellow germites?

2679
05:10:10,209 --> 05:10:11,090
You forgot to add the A.

2680
05:10:11,729 --> 05:10:12,930
It's germimites.

2681
05:10:16,040 --> 05:10:17,959
So you can't just get free money from the purse.

2682
05:10:17,959 --> 05:10:19,159
Oh, that makes sense.

2683
05:10:19,159 --> 05:10:29,000
Oh, my granite.

2684
05:10:29,639 --> 05:10:36,159
Oh, my granite.

2685
05:10:36,159 --> 05:10:51,279
It's a good build.

2686
05:10:51,279 --> 05:10:52,400
And I got good health, too.

2687
05:10:53,040 --> 05:10:54,819
This is going to work out pretty well, I think.

2688
05:10:55,619 --> 05:11:08,880
What do we got?

2689
05:11:08,880 --> 05:11:10,799
Your special is stronger and does chill.

2690
05:11:10,799 --> 05:11:15,360
Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog.

2691
05:11:15,360 --> 05:11:16,000
Which one?

2692
05:11:16,799 --> 05:11:18,200
One or two.

2693
05:11:18,200 --> 05:11:18,919
One or two.

2694
05:11:18,919 --> 05:11:19,479
They're both good.

2695
05:11:22,150 --> 05:11:23,349
Although this is probably better.

2696
05:11:24,150 --> 05:11:26,759
Pretty good lobs lock.

2697
05:11:36,020 --> 05:11:36,740
Can I interact with this?

2698
05:11:41,119 --> 05:11:42,639
Money or Poseidon?

2699
05:11:43,729 --> 05:11:44,529
Probably Poseidon.

2700
05:11:58,180 --> 05:11:58,900
Get away from me.

2701
05:12:00,639 --> 05:12:01,119
Get away.

2702
05:12:05,509 --> 05:12:06,310
Get away.

2703
05:12:06,310 --> 05:12:17,599
It's good.

2704
05:12:18,240 --> 05:12:19,759
It's working out pretty well.

2705
05:12:20,560 --> 05:12:21,840
Dad, I'm coming for you.

2706
05:12:21,840 --> 05:12:27,380
There's a certain chill about you.

2707
05:12:27,380 --> 05:12:31,860
Received an ice cold blessing courtesy of Elder Goddess Demeter, correct?

2708
05:12:32,580 --> 05:12:36,099
Now, firstly, I think water's best in liquid form, but who am I to judge?

2709
05:12:36,659 --> 05:12:38,659
Push high.

2710
05:12:40,479 --> 05:12:42,479
Attack deals more damage and knocks people away.

2711
05:12:42,479 --> 05:12:44,080
That's just that's just great.

2712
05:12:44,080 --> 05:12:46,659
Here is that's good, too, though.

2713
05:12:48,470 --> 05:12:54,389
It's more insane explosive damage or have a call that makes me invincible.

2714
05:12:58,880 --> 05:13:01,200
Or just a huge amount of rewards.

2715
05:13:01,200 --> 05:13:02,000
These are all good.

2716
05:13:02,000 --> 05:13:02,720
I don't know what to do.

2717
05:13:19,400 --> 05:13:20,279
And I'm taking the call.

2718
05:13:22,119 --> 05:13:25,520
Fishing time then.

2719
05:13:25,520 --> 05:13:31,680
Too early.

2720
05:13:31,680 --> 05:13:33,270
How is that too early?

2721
05:13:35,360 --> 05:13:37,200
Just bobbed and I hit.

2722
05:13:37,200 --> 05:13:38,639
That was late, if anything.

2723
05:13:39,200 --> 05:13:40,400
How was it too early?

2724
05:13:40,400 --> 05:14:11,919
You guys are jumpy.

2725
05:14:21,430 --> 05:14:22,229
Bow is best.

2726
05:14:22,229 --> 05:14:22,869
Bow and shield.

2727
05:14:22,869 --> 05:14:24,310
I like bow better than shield.

2728
05:14:24,310 --> 05:14:30,080
I keep I know I change my mind every single run, but I mean, I love the bow.

2729
05:14:30,080 --> 05:14:48,610
Just does it for me.

2730
05:14:48,610 --> 05:14:49,250
Perfect.

2731
05:14:49,250 --> 05:14:56,290
Dad, every weapon is good.

2732
05:14:56,290 --> 05:14:56,770
You're bad.

2733
05:14:57,650 --> 05:14:58,529
Oh, arguments.

2734
05:14:59,090 --> 05:15:00,610
Fighting in the chat room.

2735
05:15:00,610 --> 05:15:12,150
That's not a bad trade.

2736
05:15:12,150 --> 05:15:14,689
I'll just take that's a 20.

2737
05:15:14,689 --> 05:15:16,450
That's nothing for 10 gems.

2738
05:15:17,250 --> 05:15:25,599
I know people are going to say, look, you could have.

2739
05:15:25,599 --> 05:15:26,240
I couldn't have bought it.

2740
05:15:26,240 --> 05:15:26,959
I couldn't afford it.

2741
05:15:28,200 --> 05:15:28,759
Aphrodite.

2742
05:15:29,479 --> 05:15:33,680
Time for the chat bar fight.

2743
05:16:05,409 --> 05:16:08,709
Crush me.

2744
05:16:08,709 --> 05:16:09,189
Where am I?

2745
05:16:13,840 --> 05:16:15,040
I just stopped freaking out.

2746
05:16:23,299 --> 05:16:24,259
Did you go into the lava?

2747
05:16:24,259 --> 05:16:25,299
What happened?

2748
05:16:25,299 --> 05:16:31,220
I kind of want to give Aphrodite another gift.

2749
05:16:31,220 --> 05:16:33,479
I'm going to do it.

2750
05:16:33,479 --> 05:16:44,069
My lady Aphrodite, if not for our acquaintance, I'm certain that my days or nights would be

2751
05:16:44,069 --> 05:16:45,189
much drearier indeed.

2752
05:16:47,759 --> 05:16:51,080
Dearest, such a wonderfully thoughtful gift for me.

2753
05:16:51,880 --> 05:16:53,639
I love it and I would be lying if I said you shouldn't have.

2754
05:16:53,639 --> 05:16:55,639
Romancing Aphrodite.

2755
05:16:58,639 --> 05:17:03,439
I got a, oh, another one.

2756
05:17:04,000 --> 05:17:05,279
Wait, how much more stuff do you want?

2757
05:17:06,740 --> 05:17:10,549
One, two, three, four more hearts.

2758
05:17:10,549 --> 05:17:13,189
And then you talk two more hearts and you'll talk to me again.

2759
05:17:16,479 --> 05:17:17,119
What?

2760
05:17:17,119 --> 05:17:18,720
You know how hard these are to get?

2761
05:17:18,720 --> 05:17:26,240
Air is beautiful and brisk.

2762
05:17:26,240 --> 05:17:27,439
The garden's lush.

2763
05:17:27,439 --> 05:17:29,040
The feasting plentiful.

2764
05:17:29,040 --> 05:17:32,319
Why, it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed.

2765
05:17:38,400 --> 05:17:39,200
That's not bad.

2766
05:17:43,189 --> 05:17:44,069
I mean, that's just 13%.

2767
05:17:44,869 --> 05:17:45,590
Why not just do it?

2768
05:17:46,310 --> 05:17:48,290
Revenge damage is good too.

2769
05:17:48,290 --> 05:17:54,040
Do it.

2770
05:17:54,040 --> 05:17:57,090
Pomegranate time.

2771
05:18:00,529 --> 05:18:01,490
Grow up, Jerma.

2772
05:18:02,290 --> 05:18:04,740
I'm what?

2773
05:18:04,740 --> 05:18:10,340
I'm pretending to romance a woman in a video game that has like a romance feature.

2774
05:18:10,340 --> 05:18:11,779
I'm just playing the video game.

2775
05:18:11,779 --> 05:18:13,459
This is the intended feature of the video game.

2776
05:18:14,979 --> 05:18:41,240
Get over here.

2777
05:18:42,040 --> 05:18:46,880
Into the water with you.

2778
05:18:49,439 --> 05:18:49,919
Oh, shit.

2779
05:18:50,560 --> 05:18:53,189
Mini Medusa heads.

2780
05:19:08,319 --> 05:19:08,959
Shit.

2781
05:19:08,959 --> 05:19:09,680
Wasn't fast enough.

2782
05:19:10,319 --> 05:19:20,130
What's going on with my screen?

2783
05:19:20,130 --> 05:19:20,610
You see that?

2784
05:19:21,250 --> 05:19:24,340
That's weird.

2785
05:19:27,000 --> 05:19:27,880
What's going on with my screen?

2786
05:19:28,599 --> 05:19:32,080
It's like going black for a second.

2787
05:19:32,080 --> 05:19:35,040
It's like dipping black, dipping black, dipping black.

2788
05:19:35,040 --> 05:19:36,290
It's a smoke effect?

2789
05:19:36,290 --> 05:19:36,529
Oh.

2790
05:19:37,169 --> 05:19:40,470
Even more damage from the fog.

2791
05:19:41,720 --> 05:19:42,360
Super call.

2792
05:19:43,409 --> 05:19:47,009
Or a 16% reduction in all damage.

2793
05:19:47,569 --> 05:20:06,500
Yeah, it's between these two, I think.

2794
05:20:14,419 --> 05:20:14,979
I, yeah.

2795
05:20:15,540 --> 05:20:16,819
I gotta get better at hitting it though.

2796
05:20:17,459 --> 05:20:20,709
Ooh, Aphrodite and Dionysus.

2797
05:20:21,349 --> 05:20:21,990
Or Pomegranate.

2798
05:20:21,990 --> 05:20:22,869
Yeah, don't here.

2799
05:20:22,869 --> 05:20:23,750
We want upgrades.

2800
05:20:28,049 --> 05:20:29,009
Cast ignores armor.

2801
05:20:29,009 --> 05:20:29,650
Yeah, that's good too.

2802
05:20:30,610 --> 05:20:33,599
Who's favorite to choose?

2803
05:20:37,990 --> 05:20:38,709
Yeah, man.

2804
05:20:38,709 --> 05:20:39,750
You know what it's all about.

2805
05:20:43,540 --> 05:20:45,299
Using a fountain restores all your health

2806
05:20:45,299 --> 05:20:47,299
and gives you bonus damage per fountain.

2807
05:20:47,299 --> 05:20:49,110
That's good stuff.

2808
05:20:54,709 --> 05:20:56,389
Surely there's no way that could have been

2809
05:20:56,389 --> 05:20:58,549
one of the wiser choices that you've lately made.

2810
05:21:02,770 --> 05:21:04,130
Lady Aphrodite, I'm sorry.

2811
05:21:04,930 --> 05:21:06,290
My dear Aphrodite.

2812
05:21:06,290 --> 05:21:07,409
I'm so sorry, my queen.

2813
05:21:08,130 --> 05:21:09,200
I'm so sorry.

2814
05:21:10,159 --> 05:21:11,650
I'll never do it again, I swear.

2815
05:21:12,369 --> 05:21:35,970
Get away from me.

2816
05:21:35,970 --> 05:21:37,169
Stop doing the hearts thing.

2817
05:21:37,810 --> 05:21:41,409
Get away.

2818
05:21:41,970 --> 05:21:54,360
Get out of here.

2819
05:21:54,360 --> 05:21:54,840
Into the fire.

2820
05:22:05,479 --> 05:22:06,119
Cool.

2821
05:22:06,119 --> 05:22:08,080
Didn't take that much damage for a double.

2822
05:22:08,080 --> 05:22:09,040
I'm happy with that.

2823
05:22:09,040 --> 05:22:17,299
Just do not anger me again

2824
05:22:17,299 --> 05:22:19,639
or I'm gonna kill you there myself.

2825
05:22:19,639 --> 05:22:22,689
Bro, just accept her love, bro.

2826
05:22:22,689 --> 05:22:23,189
Calm down.

2827
05:22:35,119 --> 05:22:37,040
And it's a heart that flies out now.

2828
05:22:37,759 --> 05:22:44,689
I don't have enough money to buy maybe health.

2829
05:22:45,250 --> 05:22:50,159
Maybe try to get attack speed with Murmys?

2830
05:22:50,799 --> 05:23:01,650
Yeah, this is, this is free.

2831
05:23:01,650 --> 05:23:03,939
This is a fountain?

2832
05:23:04,500 --> 05:23:08,040
Why is this just for free?

2833
05:23:08,040 --> 05:23:14,450
All too quickly for you, boss.

2834
05:23:14,450 --> 05:23:16,020
Way nice as it doesn't.

2835
05:23:16,020 --> 05:23:17,060
As you're probably aware,

2836
05:23:17,060 --> 05:23:18,099
there's quite a feast though.

2837
05:23:21,459 --> 05:23:22,099
Move speed.

2838
05:23:22,819 --> 05:23:24,340
Your special is faster.

2839
05:23:28,200 --> 05:23:36,150
Hmm, that's just, yeah.

2840
05:23:37,189 --> 05:23:38,880
And here we go.

2841
05:23:38,880 --> 05:23:40,159
Just move a little bit faster.

2842
05:23:40,159 --> 05:23:40,639
That's fine.

2843
05:23:41,919 --> 05:23:45,520
All right, let's fight this boss.

2844
05:23:55,959 --> 05:23:56,919
No one gets hurt.

2845
05:24:09,240 --> 05:24:10,360
I mean, look at this damage.

2846
05:24:11,240 --> 05:24:11,959
It's unheard of.

2847
05:24:12,680 --> 05:24:16,500
Hey, bring out your little friends.

2848
05:24:17,220 --> 05:24:31,759
Shit, I missed it.

2849
05:24:32,319 --> 05:24:53,400
Just long shot it, man.

2850
05:24:53,400 --> 05:24:55,240
And here we go.

2851
05:25:06,319 --> 05:25:14,020
Okay, now let's do the, get out.

2852
05:25:14,659 --> 05:25:15,299
Throw yourself.

2853
05:25:34,099 --> 05:25:34,580
Shit.

2854
05:25:34,580 --> 05:25:35,299
Oh, fuck.

2855
05:25:35,299 --> 05:25:36,020
I'm taking a lot of damage.

2856
05:25:36,020 --> 05:25:36,419
This is bad.

2857
05:25:59,700 --> 05:26:00,340
Okay, we're good.

2858
05:26:16,720 --> 05:26:19,169
Oh, I want to end it on a, hi.

2859
05:26:19,970 --> 05:26:22,689
He's going to choke?

2860
05:26:22,689 --> 05:26:28,099
No, I'm not going to choke.

2861
05:26:28,099 --> 05:26:29,619
Choking is for the third boss fight,

2862
05:26:29,619 --> 05:26:30,900
not for the second one.

2863
05:26:30,900 --> 05:26:33,009
For safekeeping.

2864
05:26:33,009 --> 05:26:40,159
Did I miss anything?

2865
05:26:40,720 --> 05:26:52,020
Fountain, this is a full heal

2866
05:26:52,020 --> 05:26:54,340
and it's plus 3% damage permanently, right?

2867
05:26:54,340 --> 05:26:56,040
That's pretty awesome.

2868
05:26:56,840 --> 05:27:07,430
That's pretty good too.

2869
05:27:08,150 --> 05:27:10,580
I'm only 20 gold?

2870
05:27:10,580 --> 05:27:11,889
I'm taking it.

2871
05:27:21,880 --> 05:27:23,080
Save the money, save the money.

2872
05:27:23,080 --> 05:27:23,479
Well, I'm good.

2873
05:27:24,200 --> 05:27:30,180
Yeah, whatever happens here,

2874
05:27:30,180 --> 05:27:31,060
this is going to be the end.

2875
05:27:31,060 --> 05:27:34,389
I'll see you tomorrow for chat's choice after this.

2876
05:27:34,389 --> 05:27:36,130
We'll go back to this.

2877
05:27:38,049 --> 05:27:38,849
Maybe I'll just beat it.

2878
05:27:38,849 --> 05:27:40,770
You know, let's just, let's just beat it today.

2879
05:27:40,770 --> 05:27:41,650
Let's beat it right now.

2880
05:27:41,650 --> 05:27:42,770
This is the run to beat it.

2881
05:27:42,770 --> 05:27:43,490
I'm going to go for it.

2882
05:27:47,090 --> 05:27:47,490
Hammer.

2883
05:27:48,130 --> 05:28:02,639
Why did I, that was a weird throw.

2884
05:28:02,639 --> 05:28:16,959
I'm having so much fun.

2885
05:28:16,959 --> 05:28:18,319
I'm having so much fun.

2886
05:28:18,319 --> 05:28:21,110
I'm having so much fun.

2887
05:28:41,540 --> 05:28:42,580
I'm having so much fun.

2888
05:28:48,080 --> 05:28:50,560
Oh, all righty then.

2889
05:28:56,180 --> 05:28:58,279
How far away is far away?

2890
05:28:58,279 --> 05:29:01,759
Because that will kill almost every single enemy

2891
05:29:01,759 --> 05:29:03,040
in the game in one hit.

2892
05:29:03,040 --> 05:29:10,020
What do I do?

2893
05:29:10,020 --> 05:29:19,380
Hey, my mouse is being stupid.

2894
05:29:19,380 --> 05:29:20,659
I mean, it's that.

2895
05:29:20,659 --> 05:29:23,139
Your attack fire is two shots side by side,

2896
05:29:23,139 --> 05:29:29,720
but reduce damage only applies to distant foes, right?

2897
05:29:30,360 --> 05:29:32,020
But how far is distant?

2898
05:29:42,549 --> 05:29:43,430
Reduce range.

2899
05:29:44,549 --> 05:29:48,580
But okay, so this is double damage.

2900
05:29:51,919 --> 05:29:56,200
This is more, this is two times.

2901
05:29:56,200 --> 05:30:05,009
I made my decision.

2902
05:30:05,009 --> 05:30:08,049
That's it.

2903
05:30:08,049 --> 05:30:08,849
Holy shit.

2904
05:30:08,849 --> 05:30:09,569
It's two.

2905
05:30:10,209 --> 05:30:17,669
That's going to be insane though.

2906
05:30:18,310 --> 05:30:22,630
You want to know the best part about this?

2907
05:30:23,430 --> 05:30:26,229
I don't even have to worry about charging the whole thing.

2908
05:30:27,669 --> 05:30:29,750
Just get it and move around.

2909
05:30:29,750 --> 05:30:30,709
Land the perfect shot.

2910
05:30:30,709 --> 05:30:31,990
Land the shot you know you can land.

2911
05:30:31,990 --> 05:30:32,310
Get out.

2912
05:30:33,029 --> 05:30:40,069
Test it.

2913
05:30:43,000 --> 05:30:45,090
Am I there?

2914
05:30:45,650 --> 05:30:46,770
No, not you there.

2915
05:30:51,909 --> 05:30:52,470
You there.

2916
05:30:53,189 --> 05:30:59,319
I don't, I'm overwhelmed.

2917
05:30:59,880 --> 05:31:01,830
Useless.

2918
05:31:10,119 --> 05:31:10,759
You there.

2919
05:31:11,479 --> 05:31:13,939
That's all right.

2920
05:31:13,939 --> 05:31:25,959
I don't know why I think that's funny.

2921
05:31:25,959 --> 05:31:26,459
You up?

2922
05:31:28,869 --> 05:31:29,189
All right.

2923
05:31:29,189 --> 05:31:29,830
I got to play.

2924
05:31:29,830 --> 05:31:30,389
I got to play.

2925
05:31:30,389 --> 05:31:30,889
I got to play.

2926
05:31:32,689 --> 05:31:33,189
You up.

2927
05:31:36,099 --> 05:31:38,020
That's 500 damage, man.

2928
05:31:38,580 --> 05:31:39,779
Holy shit.

2929
05:31:39,779 --> 05:31:41,540
That's 700 damage.

2930
05:31:43,639 --> 05:31:44,520
You ain't got nothing.

2931
05:31:45,319 --> 05:31:48,290
This is game over if I don't act like a dumb ass.

2932
05:31:50,520 --> 05:31:51,240
Hey, you there.

2933
05:31:51,880 --> 05:31:53,000
Are you there, man?

2934
05:31:53,799 --> 05:32:10,599
Hey, don't.

2935
05:32:10,599 --> 05:32:24,900
This is a super boss killer.

2936
05:32:24,900 --> 05:32:38,470
And we have another opportunity for Hermes for increased super damage speed.

2937
05:32:38,470 --> 05:32:39,029
Oh, shit.

2938
05:32:39,029 --> 05:32:39,509
That was bad.

2939
05:32:40,069 --> 05:32:52,659
This is so good.

2940
05:32:52,659 --> 05:32:53,380
I can't blow this.

2941
05:33:31,000 --> 05:33:32,200
Get out of here, you little mutant.

2942
05:33:34,819 --> 05:33:35,540
All right, Hermes.

2943
05:33:36,659 --> 05:33:37,299
Bail me out here.

2944
05:33:39,939 --> 05:33:42,759
You attack it 10% faster.

2945
05:33:43,400 --> 05:33:44,360
Charge more.

2946
05:33:45,000 --> 05:34:07,110
Got to survive, man.

2947
05:34:08,069 --> 05:34:11,139
I got to survive, man.

2948
05:34:11,139 --> 05:34:12,419
I got to survive, man.

2949
05:34:12,419 --> 05:34:13,619
I've got to survive, man.

2950
05:34:13,619 --> 05:34:14,099
I have to.

2951
05:34:15,060 --> 05:34:16,819
I don't the attack speed.

2952
05:34:17,380 --> 05:34:18,500
Is that really that big of a deal?

2953
05:34:18,500 --> 05:34:20,900
Because it's not charge speed.

2954
05:34:20,900 --> 05:34:25,159
It's just how fast I draw the bow, right?

2955
05:34:25,799 --> 05:34:28,040
But that's OK.

2956
05:34:28,599 --> 05:34:29,560
10% is nothing.

2957
05:34:31,590 --> 05:34:33,990
Having the third dash is a major deal.

2958
05:34:33,990 --> 05:34:34,229
Don't worry.

2959
05:34:34,229 --> 05:34:35,270
We're going to get something else right here.

2960
05:34:41,830 --> 05:34:44,659
Look, it's already OK.

2961
05:34:49,889 --> 05:34:51,729
Sidon's aid got leveled up to level one.

2962
05:34:52,290 --> 05:34:54,680
There we go.

2963
05:34:55,240 --> 05:35:07,540
Your dash damage disposed in an area.

2964
05:35:08,610 --> 05:35:10,930
Your boons with knock away also rupture.

2965
05:35:11,490 --> 05:35:14,919
Victim takes damage while moving.

2966
05:35:16,500 --> 05:35:18,020
Does the explosive count as a rupture?

2967
05:35:18,580 --> 05:35:21,479
I need a dash.

2968
05:35:23,349 --> 05:35:24,229
Yeah, I need it.

2969
05:35:24,229 --> 05:35:24,709
It's true.

2970
05:35:25,430 --> 05:35:26,720
I do need a dash.

2971
05:35:26,720 --> 05:35:27,040
You're right.

2972
05:35:42,340 --> 05:35:42,659
OK.

2973
05:35:45,569 --> 05:35:45,889
Fish?

2974
05:35:45,889 --> 05:35:46,049
No.

2975
05:35:52,319 --> 05:35:52,799
Dementor.

2976
05:36:03,560 --> 05:36:10,119
That's so much fucking damage, man.

2977
05:36:10,119 --> 05:36:10,680
It really is.

2978
05:36:22,389 --> 05:36:24,150
It's so much damage.

2979
05:36:24,790 --> 05:36:26,869
Hey, where'd you come from?

2980
05:36:27,509 --> 05:36:34,080
All right.

2981
05:36:34,080 --> 05:36:34,720
This is bad.

2982
05:36:34,720 --> 05:36:35,119
Hold on.

2983
05:36:54,520 --> 05:36:56,119
Get that shit off my body.

2984
05:36:56,119 --> 05:37:12,709
Who else?

2985
05:37:12,709 --> 05:37:20,599
It took a lot of damage for that.

2986
05:37:26,360 --> 05:37:29,520
Like 10 chill stacks causes a blast effect.

2987
05:37:29,520 --> 05:37:30,560
Any health.

2988
05:37:30,560 --> 05:37:31,919
Yeah, it's time.

2989
05:37:31,919 --> 05:37:32,400
I need this.

2990
05:37:32,959 --> 05:37:34,150
While you have no...

2991
05:37:34,150 --> 05:37:34,389
What?

2992
05:37:35,029 --> 05:37:41,330
While you have no...

2993
05:37:41,970 --> 05:37:43,590
So throw out the...

2994
05:37:43,590 --> 05:37:44,630
Oh, no, that's not good.

2995
05:37:44,630 --> 05:37:46,869
Because that doesn't synergize with what I have.

2996
05:37:46,869 --> 05:37:56,770
Doesn't synergize with what I have.

2997
05:37:58,529 --> 05:37:59,169
Don't I have the thing?

2998
05:37:59,169 --> 05:37:59,970
Because look.

2999
05:37:59,970 --> 05:38:01,490
It's just going to recharge it in three seconds.

3000
05:38:02,130 --> 05:38:03,700
I have it again.

3001
05:38:03,700 --> 05:38:10,979
I mean, if I had the other one right,

3002
05:38:10,979 --> 05:38:13,220
I'd throw it out and I just don't use the casting again.

3003
05:38:13,220 --> 05:38:14,340
I can go around and do more damage.

3004
05:38:14,340 --> 05:38:17,860
So I'm just going to get the crystal back.

3005
05:38:19,720 --> 05:38:19,959
OK.

3006
05:38:21,000 --> 05:38:31,080
I'm going to say money because I can get a boon before the boss.

3007
05:38:32,680 --> 05:38:33,639
Sidon is better.

3008
05:38:33,639 --> 05:38:33,880
Sure.

3009
05:38:41,650 --> 05:38:43,330
Well, that was a really good choice.

3010
05:38:43,330 --> 05:38:44,689
I don't know how you guys knew that was going to happen,

3011
05:38:44,689 --> 05:38:45,729
but I just got more damage.

3012
05:38:48,159 --> 05:38:49,840
How did you guys know that was going to happen?

3013
05:39:00,900 --> 05:39:01,540
I'm the dev.

3014
05:39:01,540 --> 05:39:02,099
Oh, OK.

3015
05:39:10,130 --> 05:39:18,340
That's one.

3016
05:39:19,810 --> 05:39:21,330
Slamming foes into barriers.

3017
05:39:22,290 --> 05:39:23,090
I don't even know how...

3018
05:39:23,090 --> 05:39:23,810
How do I do that?

3019
05:39:24,450 --> 05:39:26,659
How do I slam?

3020
05:39:27,459 --> 05:39:32,680
If I dash into them?

3021
05:39:33,400 --> 05:39:34,279
Three.

3022
05:39:34,279 --> 05:39:35,400
It's too late for one.

3023
05:39:37,409 --> 05:39:37,889
I'm just going to...

3024
05:39:37,889 --> 05:39:38,049
OK.

3025
05:39:38,049 --> 05:39:38,930
I'm pulling slot machine.

3026
05:39:55,029 --> 05:39:55,189
Good.

3027
05:39:55,189 --> 05:39:56,389
You've got breakfast wraps.

3028
05:40:05,750 --> 05:40:07,270
Pretty pog if you ask me.

3029
05:40:07,270 --> 05:40:24,360
Good timing on that one.

3030
05:40:24,919 --> 05:40:26,040
Good timing on that one.

3031
05:40:26,599 --> 05:40:31,509
This shit bounces around.

3032
05:40:31,509 --> 05:40:31,909
Not fair.

3033
05:40:32,709 --> 05:40:48,599
I would call that a clean room.

3034
05:40:48,599 --> 05:40:54,959
I'd call that a clean room.

3035
05:40:54,959 --> 05:41:01,430
Even more health.

3036
05:41:02,869 --> 05:41:04,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3037
05:41:04,470 --> 05:41:05,029
Even more health.

3038
05:41:22,560 --> 05:41:23,200
Eat shit.

3039
05:41:23,919 --> 05:41:29,080
Don't let the little bulbs get away.

3040
05:41:29,880 --> 05:41:33,830
Wait, just let them come to me.

3041
05:41:33,830 --> 05:41:34,389
Let them come to me.

3042
05:41:34,630 --> 05:41:35,669
What's the point?

3043
05:41:35,669 --> 05:41:46,099
Health is good with this build.

3044
05:41:46,099 --> 05:41:46,659
Yeah, it is.

3045
05:41:47,299 --> 05:41:53,240
Ow.

3046
05:41:54,099 --> 05:41:54,419
Ow.

3047
05:41:55,139 --> 05:42:03,139
Give me a break.

3048
05:42:03,139 --> 05:42:04,419
You're bouncing this shit everywhere.

3049
05:42:05,060 --> 05:42:05,860
You're not even trying.

3050
05:42:05,860 --> 05:42:07,700
You're just spamming in random directions.

3051
05:42:08,340 --> 05:42:09,970
Where are you?

3052
05:42:10,689 --> 05:42:18,819
This is the first time I've ever had 200 health.

3053
05:42:23,540 --> 05:42:23,860
All right.

3054
05:42:23,860 --> 05:42:24,500
Do I want...

3055
05:42:25,060 --> 05:42:27,430
Up the shop.

3056
05:42:27,430 --> 05:42:30,959
Chaos?

3057
05:42:31,680 --> 05:42:34,740
Where?

3058
05:42:34,740 --> 05:42:41,569
You lying?

3059
05:42:41,569 --> 05:42:42,290
Oh.

3060
05:42:42,290 --> 05:42:51,409
All right.

3061
05:42:51,409 --> 05:42:52,290
This is it.

3062
05:42:52,290 --> 05:42:56,099
Here we go.

3063
05:42:56,099 --> 05:43:12,610
I mean, there I have to take three.

3064
05:43:13,569 --> 05:43:15,250
That's just me.

3065
05:43:15,250 --> 05:43:15,729
I just...

3066
05:43:15,729 --> 05:43:17,169
When it's out, I do more damage.

3067
05:43:17,169 --> 05:43:17,650
Take this too.

3068
05:43:17,650 --> 05:43:18,209
Why not?

3069
05:43:18,209 --> 05:43:19,009
Boost to the boon.

3070
05:43:19,880 --> 05:43:20,759
Frost flourish.

3071
05:43:20,759 --> 05:43:21,560
Got upgraded.

3072
05:43:21,560 --> 05:43:22,279
What does that one do?

3073
05:43:23,000 --> 05:43:34,880
Who the hell is it?

3074
05:43:42,599 --> 05:43:44,119
Oh, it's wicked good.

3075
05:43:44,119 --> 05:43:45,000
It's wicked good.

3076
05:43:45,000 --> 05:43:45,959
It's wicked good.

3077
05:43:45,959 --> 05:43:46,840
It's wicked good.

3078
05:43:46,840 --> 05:43:47,080
All right.

3079
05:43:47,080 --> 05:43:48,119
Let's go.

3080
05:43:48,119 --> 05:43:49,720
I'm going to kill that Minotaur.

3081
05:43:49,720 --> 05:43:51,000
I'm going to rip his eyes out.

3082
05:43:51,000 --> 05:44:08,520
You seek to break through to but you shall leave.

3083
05:44:08,520 --> 05:44:11,639
All the equivalent of it here in the splendors of Elysium.

3084
05:44:11,639 --> 05:44:12,919
I'm spamming the bomb.

3085
05:44:12,919 --> 05:44:14,599
I'm going to hit B over and over again.

3086
05:44:14,599 --> 05:44:16,520
Can you leave me with little choice but to make you...

3087
05:44:16,520 --> 05:44:17,560
One, two, three.

3088
05:44:18,119 --> 05:44:19,159
One, two, three.

3089
05:44:19,159 --> 05:44:20,119
Go, go, go.

3090
05:44:21,159 --> 05:44:55,459
Ow.

3091
05:44:55,459 --> 05:45:11,729
That did a little damage to him.

3092
05:45:37,509 --> 05:45:37,909
Come here.

3093
05:45:39,090 --> 05:45:39,569
Come here.

3094
05:45:40,130 --> 05:45:40,610
Come here.

3095
05:45:45,779 --> 05:45:57,009
Where is he?

3096
05:45:57,009 --> 05:45:57,750
Where's the bull?

3097
05:45:58,310 --> 05:46:10,020
Ow, that hurt.

3098
05:46:10,020 --> 05:46:19,029
You fucker.

3099
05:46:41,220 --> 05:46:41,700
Oh, good.

3100
05:46:41,700 --> 05:46:42,900
Somebody just made me laugh.

3101
05:46:46,069 --> 05:46:46,950
Somebody just fucking...

3102
05:46:46,950 --> 05:46:47,990
Why did I look at chat?

3103
05:46:49,110 --> 05:47:14,209
All right.

3104
05:47:14,209 --> 05:47:14,689
This is it.

3105
05:47:30,849 --> 05:47:34,310
You block everything.

3106
05:47:34,310 --> 05:47:35,189
You fucking punk.

3107
05:47:35,909 --> 05:48:16,639
Hey.

3108
05:48:46,439 --> 05:48:49,240
And I got full health and two revives.

3109
05:48:51,220 --> 05:48:53,220
Dad, I'm coming for you now.

3110
05:48:54,340 --> 05:48:55,380
I'm coming for dad.

3111
05:48:56,259 --> 05:48:59,669
I might even have to break out something really important for dad.

3112
05:49:00,310 --> 05:49:09,139
We'll see.

3113
05:49:09,860 --> 05:49:14,400
I'm going to have to whip out something for dad.

3114
05:49:14,400 --> 05:49:15,919
No, I'm something else.

3115
05:49:18,470 --> 05:49:23,830
I'm going to have to whip out...

3116
05:49:23,830 --> 05:49:26,630
I'm going to have to whip out something for you, dad.

3117
05:49:29,200 --> 05:49:30,959
Stop, stop, stop.

3118
05:49:30,959 --> 05:49:31,439
Stop it.

3119
05:49:33,250 --> 05:49:34,130
Oh, my God.

3120
05:49:34,209 --> 05:49:35,409
Why did I say it like that?

3121
05:49:36,130 --> 05:49:39,700
I'm just going to buy this.

3122
05:49:39,700 --> 05:49:40,659
It's 15 bucks.

3123
05:49:43,490 --> 05:49:43,729
All right.

3124
05:49:43,729 --> 05:49:44,130
Let's go.

3125
05:49:48,770 --> 05:49:49,970
I got to be careful.

3126
05:49:50,610 --> 05:49:53,729
I'm going to save Poseidon's explosive.

3127
05:49:53,729 --> 05:49:54,849
Why would you waste your money on that?

3128
05:49:54,849 --> 05:49:56,689
Doesn't that work at dad?

3129
05:49:57,409 --> 05:49:58,869
He did that.

3130
05:49:58,869 --> 05:49:59,110
What?

3131
05:49:59,750 --> 05:50:01,830
Did you swap out the first already?

3132
05:50:01,830 --> 05:50:02,869
I hope so.

3133
05:50:02,869 --> 05:50:03,110
Yeah.

3134
05:50:03,669 --> 05:50:06,950
I'm ready.

3135
05:50:11,119 --> 05:50:27,200
No fish in here, right?

3136
05:50:29,330 --> 05:50:30,130
Oops.

3137
05:50:30,130 --> 05:50:31,090
He just even told me.

3138
05:50:34,500 --> 05:50:35,139
All right.

3139
05:50:35,139 --> 05:50:35,619
What do we got?

3140
05:50:37,299 --> 05:50:41,110
We've got pomegranates, Poseidon.

3141
05:50:47,909 --> 05:50:49,110
Wait, there's a fish in this last...

3142
05:50:49,110 --> 05:50:49,349
Okay.

3143
05:50:49,349 --> 05:50:50,150
I don't want to screw this up.

3144
05:50:51,110 --> 05:50:53,860
So you can get faked out here.

3145
05:50:54,500 --> 05:50:56,799
So wait for the ding.

3146
05:51:26,400 --> 05:51:27,200
So we're going with...

3147
05:51:27,599 --> 05:51:28,240
We're going with...

3148
05:51:30,790 --> 05:51:45,090
Okay.

3149
05:51:45,090 --> 05:51:45,409
That was...

3150
05:51:45,409 --> 05:51:47,810
I kind of had no idea what the hell was going on in this room.

3151
05:51:47,810 --> 05:52:02,979
Good.

3152
05:52:02,979 --> 05:52:04,080
Come on.

3153
05:52:04,080 --> 05:52:05,119
This is the one.

3154
05:52:05,119 --> 05:52:06,479
This is the one.

3155
05:52:06,560 --> 05:52:07,279
This is the run.

3156
05:52:59,959 --> 05:53:00,819
Oh, shit.

3157
05:53:14,259 --> 05:53:20,720
Final room.

3158
05:53:20,720 --> 05:53:21,279
Holy shit.

3159
05:53:21,279 --> 05:53:22,319
Those things fall down.

3160
05:53:33,189 --> 05:53:34,229
No poison.

3161
05:53:34,229 --> 05:53:35,509
Don't get touched by that shit.

3162
05:53:36,150 --> 05:53:40,340
Who's left?

3163
05:53:41,080 --> 05:53:41,639
Oh, you.

3164
05:53:45,029 --> 05:53:45,270
Ding.

3165
05:53:45,830 --> 05:53:48,720
225 health.

3166
05:53:48,720 --> 05:53:51,299
And a shop.

3167
05:53:55,459 --> 05:53:56,259
No, no, no.

3168
05:53:56,259 --> 05:53:57,060
None of it.

3169
05:53:57,060 --> 05:54:00,279
Does it earn?

3170
05:54:00,279 --> 05:54:15,279
I don't have enough money.

3171
05:54:15,279 --> 05:54:17,090
All right.

3172
05:54:17,090 --> 05:54:18,389
Frozen time.

3173
05:54:18,389 --> 05:54:31,439
This is so good.

3174
05:54:31,439 --> 05:54:32,479
It's so much damage.

3175
05:54:32,479 --> 05:54:33,599
It's so wonderful.

3176
05:54:33,599 --> 05:54:38,840
An itchy nose for a second.

3177
05:54:38,840 --> 05:54:39,560
Sorry.

3178
05:54:39,560 --> 05:54:45,009
I had to just rip my hand up and just smack into the microphone.

3179
05:54:55,439 --> 05:54:56,080
Almost got hit.

3180
05:54:57,860 --> 05:54:58,500
Very close.

3181
05:55:19,909 --> 05:55:20,950
700.

3182
05:55:20,950 --> 05:55:32,099
700.

3183
05:55:32,099 --> 05:55:32,580
And out.

3184
05:55:32,580 --> 05:55:33,299
Don't get poisoned.

3185
05:55:34,099 --> 05:55:39,990
Poison.

3186
05:55:39,990 --> 05:55:40,549
I'm poisoned.

3187
05:55:40,549 --> 05:55:41,189
Where's the cure?

3188
05:55:41,189 --> 05:55:41,750
Where's the cure?

3189
05:56:09,959 --> 05:56:12,599
I can feel it in my loins right now.

3190
05:56:12,599 --> 05:56:13,799
Don't say that yet.

3191
05:56:13,799 --> 05:56:14,439
Don't say that.

3192
05:56:15,720 --> 05:56:16,279
What's going on?

3193
05:56:20,130 --> 05:56:21,889
You are so uptight now.

3194
05:56:21,889 --> 05:56:23,169
Just ease up a little there.

3195
05:56:23,169 --> 05:56:24,529
Let's see what we can do.

3196
05:56:24,529 --> 05:56:25,250
Are you gonna duo?

3197
05:56:27,909 --> 05:56:29,080
You're...

3198
05:56:29,080 --> 05:56:29,560
Wait.

3199
05:56:29,560 --> 05:56:33,330
Your cast blasts an area with freezing fog that inflicts chill.

3200
05:56:33,330 --> 05:56:34,930
Plus 30% more damage.

3201
05:56:34,930 --> 05:56:40,709
Wait, what?

3202
05:56:40,709 --> 05:56:40,950
What?

3203
05:56:43,409 --> 05:56:43,889
Teamwork.

3204
05:56:45,939 --> 05:56:46,340
What?

3205
05:56:49,909 --> 05:56:51,590
And it sticks around for a while too.

3206
05:56:54,470 --> 05:56:54,790
Okay.

3207
05:56:55,430 --> 05:56:57,090
All right.

3208
05:56:57,090 --> 05:56:58,119
All right.

3209
05:56:58,759 --> 05:57:00,020
This should be...

3210
05:57:00,020 --> 05:57:01,779
I should make out pretty well here.

3211
05:57:02,500 --> 05:57:04,819
This is the best build I've probably had since playing the game.

3212
05:57:10,290 --> 05:57:12,130
Money or pomegranate?

3213
05:57:12,450 --> 05:57:23,240
Bet it's in here.

3214
05:57:40,369 --> 05:57:43,810
I'm gonna get like quadruple combo'd by dad and somehow.

3215
05:57:43,810 --> 05:57:44,529
It's gonna be like...

3216
05:57:46,790 --> 05:57:50,159
I was in the air the whole time, by the way.

3217
05:57:50,159 --> 05:58:00,119
What's on me?

3218
05:58:31,200 --> 05:58:31,439
No.

3219
05:58:32,419 --> 05:58:33,220
No.

3220
05:58:33,220 --> 05:58:33,779
No.

3221
05:58:33,779 --> 05:58:34,020
No.

3222
05:58:34,020 --> 05:58:34,979
Does this count for dad?

3223
05:58:37,169 --> 05:58:37,889
No.

3224
05:58:37,889 --> 05:58:55,009
Oops, I missed.

3225
05:58:55,729 --> 05:59:10,770
Holy shit.

3226
05:59:10,770 --> 05:59:11,970
I didn't even know those were there.

3227
05:59:13,090 --> 05:59:13,970
That's good to know.

3228
05:59:19,680 --> 05:59:20,400
Holy shit.

3229
05:59:21,360 --> 05:59:22,880
I was trying to move into a safe spot.

3230
05:59:31,880 --> 05:59:32,759
This room sucks.

3231
05:59:34,680 --> 05:59:35,560
This room sucks.

3232
05:59:49,479 --> 05:59:50,209
Okay.

3233
05:59:53,860 --> 05:59:56,979
Your attack deals more damage and inflicts weak.

3234
05:59:56,979 --> 06:00:02,479
Cast lobs, a larger area, or your call is better.

3235
06:00:02,479 --> 06:00:06,959
Did I do more attack or the cast damage does more?

3236
06:00:06,959 --> 06:00:07,360
Definitely.

3237
06:00:07,360 --> 06:00:08,479
Just let's go straight up damage.

3238
06:00:09,439 --> 06:00:09,840
All right.

3239
06:00:09,840 --> 06:00:10,959
I got two revives.

3240
06:00:11,599 --> 06:00:12,880
Still haven't found the sack, by the way.

3241
06:00:12,880 --> 06:00:14,080
This is kind of unlucky, isn't it?

3242
06:00:14,799 --> 06:00:18,119
This is...

3243
06:00:18,119 --> 06:00:18,759
I need health.

3244
06:00:32,680 --> 06:00:33,639
And I got two more left.

3245
06:00:33,639 --> 06:00:35,000
I'm going to go with money.

3246
06:00:35,720 --> 06:00:35,959
Right?

3247
06:00:36,520 --> 06:00:37,169
All right.

3248
06:00:37,169 --> 06:00:40,209
Do I buy Poseidon right now or pomegranate right now?

3249
06:00:40,770 --> 06:00:48,389
I think you guys are very torn on this.

3250
06:00:48,950 --> 06:00:57,119
Don't spend it all in one place, mate.

3251
06:01:03,590 --> 06:01:04,229
Fog, I think.

3252
06:01:07,799 --> 06:01:08,200
Yep.

3253
06:01:08,200 --> 06:01:08,520
All right.

3254
06:01:09,590 --> 06:01:10,709
I got a heal.

3255
06:01:10,709 --> 06:01:11,669
I need a fountain.

3256
06:01:12,549 --> 06:01:14,520
Give me a fountain here somewhere.

3257
06:01:15,650 --> 06:01:15,970
Money.

3258
06:01:16,689 --> 06:01:17,889
This one, I guess.

3259
06:01:17,889 --> 06:01:31,939
Nope.

3260
06:01:31,939 --> 06:01:33,220
Don't sell anything.

3261
06:01:33,220 --> 06:01:53,939
What?

3262
06:01:53,939 --> 06:01:54,979
A codex update.

3263
06:01:54,979 --> 06:01:55,540
What?

3264
06:01:55,540 --> 06:01:56,529
What?

3265
06:01:57,330 --> 06:01:58,770
Did you hear about this guy?

3266
06:01:58,770 --> 06:02:00,240
He's not even in this room.

3267
06:02:00,799 --> 06:02:02,000
He's cool, though.

3268
06:02:02,000 --> 06:02:14,439
What do we got?

3269
06:02:22,500 --> 06:02:22,979
Boss time.

3270
06:02:23,540 --> 06:02:37,119
This is horrible.

3271
06:02:43,409 --> 06:02:44,209
Holy shit.

3272
06:02:44,209 --> 06:02:44,930
That was horrible.

3273
06:02:46,240 --> 06:02:47,599
I still don't have the...

3274
06:02:48,240 --> 06:02:51,040
Still don't have the sack to give the dog?

3275
06:02:51,840 --> 06:03:01,560
What are you trying to do to me here, game?

3276
06:03:01,560 --> 06:03:04,119
This better be a fountain.

3277
06:03:14,610 --> 06:03:15,810
Buy another palm?

3278
06:03:15,810 --> 06:03:22,259
I don't want to do anvil.

3279
06:03:22,259 --> 06:03:27,299
Anvil scares me a little.

3280
06:03:27,299 --> 06:03:28,180
Anvil scares me.

3281
06:03:28,180 --> 06:03:33,270
I don't want to lose something and gain something.

3282
06:03:33,270 --> 06:03:34,310
Palm is double.

3283
06:03:34,310 --> 06:03:35,189
It's a double palm.

3284
06:03:35,750 --> 06:03:36,919
It's a double...

3285
06:03:36,919 --> 06:03:38,439
Wait, Poseidon has a heal.

3286
06:03:39,080 --> 06:03:39,880
He does.

3287
06:03:39,880 --> 06:03:41,240
But what if I don't get it?

3288
06:03:41,880 --> 06:03:44,119
What if I don't get it?

3289
06:03:44,759 --> 06:03:47,060
Palm is two levels.

3290
06:03:56,080 --> 06:03:56,799
Oh my god.

3291
06:03:56,799 --> 06:03:57,279
What happened?

3292
06:04:00,759 --> 06:04:01,159
Why?

3293
06:04:03,240 --> 06:04:03,560
Why?

3294
06:04:05,479 --> 06:04:06,680
Your call pulls in...

3295
06:04:07,319 --> 06:04:09,799
Your attack and special is stronger in the first 10 seconds.

3296
06:04:10,439 --> 06:04:14,229
Any boons you find are more potent as there's no more.

3297
06:04:21,990 --> 06:04:25,439
Should have done double palm.

3298
06:04:26,080 --> 06:04:28,340
I actually might still be able to do it, depending.

3299
06:04:28,340 --> 06:04:29,060
Because that means...

3300
06:04:29,060 --> 06:04:29,700
Is this going to be...

3301
06:04:30,500 --> 06:04:31,939
Maybe this way.

3302
06:04:31,939 --> 06:04:41,430
Give me some money.

3303
06:04:41,430 --> 06:04:45,060
Doesn't taste like anything.

3304
06:04:45,060 --> 06:04:46,259
Run has been ruined.

3305
06:04:46,259 --> 06:04:46,659
Not yet.

3306
06:04:47,540 --> 06:04:48,659
Man, I might die in here once.

3307
06:04:48,659 --> 06:04:49,299
That's not good.

3308
06:04:50,099 --> 06:04:58,119
Shit, they're everywhere.

3309
06:05:00,740 --> 06:05:01,299
I need money.

3310
06:05:01,860 --> 06:05:02,259
Come on.

3311
06:05:03,060 --> 06:05:03,619
No urns?

3312
06:05:05,360 --> 06:05:05,919
Urns.

3313
06:05:05,919 --> 06:05:06,479
Please.

3314
06:05:06,479 --> 06:05:06,959
Please.

3315
06:05:06,959 --> 06:05:07,360
Urns.

3316
06:05:08,080 --> 06:05:08,560
Tasty.

3317
06:05:20,689 --> 06:05:21,729
200 gold?

3318
06:05:21,729 --> 06:05:22,369
That's not enough.

3319
06:05:23,490 --> 06:05:24,790
Not enough.

3320
06:05:24,790 --> 06:05:30,310
Cerberus must be starving.

3321
06:05:30,310 --> 06:05:31,189
Oh my god.

3322
06:05:31,189 --> 06:05:32,470
Oh my god.

3323
06:05:32,470 --> 06:05:35,119
Cerberus.

3324
06:05:35,119 --> 06:05:37,409
Oh my god.

3325
06:05:37,409 --> 06:05:38,790
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3326
06:05:38,790 --> 06:05:39,189
This is the one.

3327
06:05:39,189 --> 06:05:40,470
Unless I accept this message.

3328
06:05:40,470 --> 06:05:41,349
This is the one.

3329
06:05:41,349 --> 06:05:42,709
Your attack deals more damage.

3330
06:05:42,709 --> 06:05:44,630
Plus 53% damage.

3331
06:05:44,630 --> 06:05:46,470
But wait, it replaces what?

3332
06:05:46,470 --> 06:05:51,919
Your boons with knockback also rupture.

3333
06:05:51,919 --> 06:05:52,880
A more rupture.

3334
06:05:52,880 --> 06:06:00,500
I can't...

3335
06:06:00,500 --> 06:06:02,659
I don't want to replace heartbreak strike.

3336
06:06:02,659 --> 06:06:07,919
Who's the only good option?

3337
06:06:07,919 --> 06:06:13,090
Full health, two revives, god build.

3338
06:06:13,090 --> 06:06:14,049
What could go wrong?

3339
06:06:16,229 --> 06:06:17,509
We'll find out soon enough.

3340
06:06:23,299 --> 06:06:24,580
I don't have enough money to buy anything.

3341
06:06:26,919 --> 06:06:27,720
All right, this is it.

3342
06:06:27,720 --> 06:06:28,119
Let's go.

3343
06:06:34,000 --> 06:06:35,200
Don't throw for views.

3344
06:06:35,200 --> 06:06:36,319
Why would I do that, man?

3345
06:06:36,319 --> 06:06:37,599
Okay, I'm not going to do...

3346
06:06:37,599 --> 06:06:38,799
I'm not going to throw for views.

3347
06:06:38,799 --> 06:06:40,080
Have you seen how I've been playing?

3348
06:06:40,080 --> 06:06:41,040
I'm not just throwing.

3349
06:06:41,040 --> 06:06:42,159
I'm not like walking off a cliff.

3350
06:06:42,159 --> 06:06:43,680
I'm not throwing for views.

3351
06:06:43,680 --> 06:06:46,680
Plus, why would we throw for views?

3352
06:06:46,680 --> 06:06:50,279
Like, like 2,000 people have left by tonight.

3353
06:06:50,279 --> 06:06:50,919
By right now.

3354
06:06:51,959 --> 06:06:54,919
Am I going to go die now and be like whoopsie-hee-hee?

3355
06:06:54,919 --> 06:06:57,680
I should have done that four hours ago.

3356
06:06:59,619 --> 06:07:00,740
All right, let's go.

3357
06:07:00,740 --> 06:07:01,299
This is it.

3358
06:07:01,299 --> 06:07:01,779
This is it.

3359
06:07:01,779 --> 06:07:02,500
Just relax.

3360
06:07:02,500 --> 06:07:03,220
Just relax.

3361
06:07:03,220 --> 06:07:03,860
I'm good.

3362
06:07:03,860 --> 06:07:11,569
Antic Cerberus accepts the prince's foul offering.

3363
06:07:11,569 --> 06:07:12,209
It's just regular.

3364
06:07:12,209 --> 06:07:12,849
It's just a normal...

3365
06:07:12,849 --> 06:07:14,130
It's a regular video game.

3366
06:07:14,130 --> 06:07:15,330
And just you get to kill the boss.

3367
06:07:15,330 --> 06:07:15,830
That's it.

3368
06:07:16,900 --> 06:07:17,700
I'm not going to look at chat.

3369
06:07:17,700 --> 06:07:18,200
I'm not.

3370
06:07:20,959 --> 06:07:21,200
All right.

3371
06:07:21,200 --> 06:07:21,759
Come on, dad.

3372
06:07:21,759 --> 06:07:22,159
Let's go.

3373
06:07:22,799 --> 06:07:25,599
Just always keep your cast out.

3374
06:07:26,240 --> 06:07:28,130
Move around.

3375
06:07:28,689 --> 06:07:30,310
Take a bunch of less damage.

3376
06:07:30,310 --> 06:07:31,430
Just get the shots in.

3377
06:07:32,229 --> 06:07:33,400
Just be...

3378
06:07:33,400 --> 06:07:34,119
Just do it.

3379
06:07:34,680 --> 06:07:40,040
Hide behind the pillars during the lasers.

3380
06:07:40,680 --> 06:07:42,439
I hope I remember that.

3381
06:07:42,439 --> 06:07:44,580
I hope I don't forget that.

3382
06:07:44,580 --> 06:07:47,799
I'm looking for full first phase without take...

3383
06:07:47,799 --> 06:07:50,520
Without using one of my lives.

3384
06:07:50,520 --> 06:07:53,479
All right, let's go.

3385
06:07:53,479 --> 06:07:55,159
I feel like I got to get the cords off.

3386
06:07:55,159 --> 06:08:12,529
It was a time when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit.

3387
06:08:12,529 --> 06:08:17,810
What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause.

3388
06:08:17,810 --> 06:08:18,689
Oh, that can possibly be true.

3389
06:08:18,689 --> 06:08:19,409
Just for you.

3390
06:08:19,409 --> 06:08:25,009
What about Orpheus, Theseus, Hercules, Odysseus, Calvus, Tails, or these men delving into the...

3391
06:08:25,009 --> 06:08:26,610
They left on my authority alone.

3392
06:08:26,610 --> 06:08:30,689
If there's a situation that does not apply to you, just listen.

3393
06:08:30,689 --> 06:08:33,009
You believe you are entitled simply to walk out there.

3394
06:08:33,009 --> 06:08:36,130
DMCA from cheers to you don't think that's going to happen.

3395
06:08:36,130 --> 06:08:36,369
Let's go.

3396
06:08:36,369 --> 06:08:38,319
So sit back.

3397
06:08:38,319 --> 06:08:38,959
Get ready.

3398
06:08:40,840 --> 06:08:41,959
Here it comes.

3399
06:08:43,000 --> 06:09:06,959
We don't want to think you're the one who steps up and gets things done around us.

3400
06:09:06,959 --> 06:09:09,040
And then you go the extra mile.

3401
06:09:10,319 --> 06:09:15,720
You're doing a great job.

3402
06:09:15,720 --> 06:09:17,240
A great job.

3403
06:09:25,270 --> 06:09:26,150
We'll tell them.

3404
06:09:28,790 --> 06:09:30,790
Job.

3405
06:09:34,369 --> 06:09:34,930
Slow down.

3406
06:09:34,930 --> 06:10:23,810
He's coming back.

3407
06:10:23,810 --> 06:10:24,290
I can tell.

3408
06:10:33,380 --> 06:10:37,959
We want to tell you that we have faith in you and we know you can do it.

3409
06:10:42,150 --> 06:10:47,349
We know you've got everything it takes to accomplish whatever your heart desires.

3410
06:10:50,259 --> 06:10:58,310
That dream you're going, that career you want, that recognition you're seeing, it is yours.

3411
06:10:59,270 --> 06:11:03,759
Just listen.

3412
06:11:03,759 --> 06:11:05,119
Everyone agrees.

3413
06:11:06,000 --> 06:11:10,840
We're on your side.

3414
06:11:11,560 --> 06:11:12,759
We're here for you.

3415
06:11:13,560 --> 06:11:14,759
We believe in you.

3416
06:11:17,909 --> 06:11:20,389
We believe in you.

3417
06:12:19,680 --> 06:12:31,619
No matter what has ever happened in my life, you have always been there for me.

3418
06:12:32,259 --> 06:12:36,080
And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever receive.

3419
06:12:36,959 --> 06:12:39,279
The greatest gift anyone could ever give.

3420
06:12:40,639 --> 06:12:47,669
You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know.

3421
06:12:49,189 --> 06:12:52,709
Look of love in the dictionary and there's your picture.

3422
06:13:05,110 --> 06:13:06,549
Thank you, my friend.

3423
06:13:08,150 --> 06:13:12,849
I can't even hear what they're saying.

3424
06:13:13,490 --> 06:13:14,849
The crowd is too loud.

3425
06:13:17,169 --> 06:13:18,610
The crowd's too loud.

3426
06:13:20,740 --> 06:13:21,779
Come on, say it.

3427
06:13:36,639 --> 06:13:37,759
All right, the crowd's dying down.

3428
06:13:37,759 --> 06:13:40,930
The Cerberus is doing very well.

3429
06:13:40,930 --> 06:13:42,950
Cerberus is doing very well.

3430
06:13:42,950 --> 06:13:43,189
Good.

3431
06:13:47,139 --> 06:13:48,099
We did it.

3432
06:13:48,099 --> 06:13:48,819
Hooray.

3433
06:13:48,819 --> 06:13:51,060
I beat the game on normal difficulty.

3434
06:13:51,060 --> 06:13:51,619
Wow.

3435
06:13:51,619 --> 06:13:52,580
What excitement.

3436
06:14:00,049 --> 06:14:01,810
That build was, it's so good though.

3437
06:14:02,369 --> 06:14:05,509
Many favors here.

3438
06:14:05,509 --> 06:14:08,389
They'll answer me one question and I'll give it some thought.

3439
06:14:08,389 --> 06:14:09,349
How's that?

3440
06:14:09,349 --> 06:14:11,349
I thought I was going to choke at the end there.

3441
06:14:11,349 --> 06:14:15,119
When I took the second death, I was like, I'm dead.

3442
06:14:15,119 --> 06:14:18,080
I was like, no, because he only had like 60% health left.

3443
06:14:18,080 --> 06:14:19,279
I was like, what if I'm going to die here?

3444
06:14:19,919 --> 06:14:28,049
Ask it anyway.

3445
06:14:28,049 --> 06:14:29,569
I'll just do that nine more times.

3446
06:14:29,569 --> 06:14:30,069
Okay.

3447
06:14:34,259 --> 06:14:36,020
Thank you, Pattycake, for the 20 community subs.

3448
06:14:36,020 --> 06:14:37,060
That's an insane amount of money.

3449
06:14:38,130 --> 06:14:39,810
And Daddy Warbucks with five.

3450
06:14:39,810 --> 06:14:40,310
Thank you, guys.

3451
06:14:41,009 --> 06:14:44,560
For Stephanie, your mother.

3452
06:14:44,560 --> 06:14:45,360
Oh, we're getting lore here.

3453
06:14:45,360 --> 06:14:45,680
Hold on.

3454
06:14:45,680 --> 06:14:46,560
Why did she leave?

3455
06:14:47,200 --> 06:15:01,970
Because she escaped.

3456
06:15:02,610 --> 06:15:03,110
What?

3457
06:15:05,250 --> 06:15:06,049
Made it.

3458
06:15:06,049 --> 06:15:06,549
Barely.

3459
06:15:07,409 --> 06:15:08,770
Oh, this is like, hey, you did it.

3460
06:15:09,830 --> 06:15:11,590
Clear time, 56 minutes.

3461
06:15:11,590 --> 06:15:12,310
New record.

3462
06:15:13,650 --> 06:15:15,490
Current streak, one.

3463
06:15:15,490 --> 06:15:17,409
Best streak, one.

3464
06:15:17,409 --> 06:15:19,590
Total clear, one.

3465
06:15:22,639 --> 06:15:23,139
Hooray.

3466
06:15:29,490 --> 06:15:30,209
Well, here it is.

3467
06:15:31,330 --> 06:15:33,810
I got a lot of things to spend, too.

3468
06:15:33,810 --> 06:15:36,450
Ah, that was hard but fun.

3469
06:15:36,450 --> 06:15:38,950
This build was disgusting.

3470
06:15:38,950 --> 06:15:41,700
That's the only reason why I beat it.

3471
06:15:41,700 --> 06:15:42,200
Very cool.

3472
06:15:42,659 --> 06:15:44,040
Now what?

3473
06:15:45,169 --> 06:15:55,970
Oh, you know what was the big run saver here?

3474
06:15:55,970 --> 06:15:57,990
The double.

3475
06:15:57,990 --> 06:15:59,889
Shooting two of these together.

3476
06:16:00,450 --> 06:16:02,180
Just too good.

3477
06:16:05,540 --> 06:16:06,040
Ish, no.

3478
06:16:08,229 --> 06:16:08,729
Leave.

3479
06:16:09,110 --> 06:16:17,520
It was the cast that did it?

3480
06:16:17,520 --> 06:16:18,080
Probably.

3481
06:16:18,080 --> 06:16:19,279
Well, I got the duo cast, right?

3482
06:16:19,919 --> 06:16:22,319
Beyond the frozen overlook.

3483
06:16:22,319 --> 06:16:24,770
Await the first glimpse of the sun to your left.

3484
06:16:24,770 --> 06:16:25,409
Made it to Greece.

3485
06:16:25,409 --> 06:16:28,020
Now onboard through the cold.

3486
06:16:28,020 --> 06:16:29,779
Sure hope this works, Nix.

3487
06:16:29,779 --> 06:16:45,060
Wouldn't it be kind of funny if instead of Greece,

3488
06:16:45,860 --> 06:16:48,180
it just sounds like, I don't know, Cleveland or something.

3489
06:16:48,180 --> 06:16:49,909
Be like, wait, what?

3490
06:16:50,549 --> 06:16:52,279
The surface.

3491
06:16:52,840 --> 06:16:54,119
Wind swept.

3492
06:16:54,119 --> 06:16:55,560
Wracked by freezing cold.

3493
06:16:56,200 --> 06:17:01,400
Nonetheless instills within the prince a sense of awe and the sublime.

3494
06:17:01,400 --> 06:17:04,069
For it is unlike anything that he has seen.

3495
06:17:06,200 --> 06:17:07,639
Circus goes to Cleveland.

3496
06:17:11,169 --> 06:17:16,610
Beautiful.

3497
06:17:16,610 --> 06:17:17,810
It is beautiful, isn't it?

3498
06:17:18,369 --> 06:17:33,490
Oh, that's nice.

3499
06:17:36,229 --> 06:17:36,869
Thing.

3500
06:17:36,869 --> 06:17:39,119
That's the sun.

3501
06:17:39,119 --> 06:17:40,479
Can I not be outside during this?

3502
06:17:40,479 --> 06:17:43,439
Is it a fire or something?

3503
06:17:43,439 --> 06:17:44,720
Something to do with my skin burn?

3504
06:17:44,720 --> 06:17:45,439
Am I like a vampire?

3505
06:17:59,139 --> 06:18:02,340
There's not a final final boss.

3506
06:18:03,509 --> 06:18:04,009
Is there?

3507
06:18:04,799 --> 06:18:05,759
I feel like there could be.

3508
06:18:10,599 --> 06:18:11,479
Wow.

3509
06:18:11,479 --> 06:18:16,310
I made it to Greece where they have only one food instead of three foods.

3510
06:18:19,000 --> 06:18:20,360
Oh, fuck this place.

3511
06:18:20,360 --> 06:18:21,479
All you have is tomatoes.

3512
06:18:22,119 --> 06:18:25,639
We had at least fish and bread downstairs.

3513
06:18:29,169 --> 06:18:32,290
And I think, I don't know about this.

3514
06:18:32,290 --> 06:18:35,650
Pray, who might you be wandering all the way out here?

3515
06:18:35,650 --> 06:18:38,740
You're trespassing on private property, you know.

3516
06:18:38,740 --> 06:18:39,779
Speak up.

3517
06:18:39,779 --> 06:18:43,110
What about the cabbage?

3518
06:18:43,830 --> 06:18:46,020
Oh, yeah, I'm not going to eat like grass.

3519
06:18:46,659 --> 06:18:49,220
What, would you eat like trees?

3520
06:18:49,220 --> 06:18:49,700
Grass?

3521
06:18:49,700 --> 06:18:50,259
No, thank you.

3522
06:18:51,619 --> 06:18:52,979
Meat and cheese only.

3523
06:18:52,979 --> 06:19:05,700
Persephone, is Zagreus and might be your son.

3524
06:19:05,700 --> 06:19:07,220
Get out or I shall make you.

3525
06:19:07,220 --> 06:19:09,459
I thought it said make out with you.

3526
06:19:12,319 --> 06:19:15,040
I didn't read the you after the second line there.

3527
06:19:15,919 --> 06:19:18,319
Get out of here or I shall make out with you.

3528
06:19:19,939 --> 06:19:23,080
So then you are, if you hate me.

3529
06:19:23,080 --> 06:19:25,159
But I'm not leaving until I get some answers.

3530
06:19:25,159 --> 06:19:27,080
You existed.

3531
06:19:27,799 --> 06:19:28,759
Why did you leave me?

3532
06:19:29,720 --> 06:19:32,759
What is Persephone the god of?

3533
06:19:32,759 --> 06:19:33,639
You died.

3534
06:19:33,639 --> 06:19:34,139
Verdure.

3535
06:19:34,919 --> 06:19:35,419
Verdure.

3536
06:19:35,419 --> 06:19:35,880
You died.

3537
06:19:35,880 --> 06:19:36,360
Verdure?

3538
06:19:36,360 --> 06:19:37,080
What is verdure?

3539
06:19:37,080 --> 06:19:37,720
His burning feet.

3540
06:19:37,720 --> 06:19:40,500
They sputtered out when you were born.

3541
06:19:40,500 --> 06:19:41,000
Beauty.

3542
06:19:41,619 --> 06:19:45,299
Are you standing here before me?

3543
06:19:45,299 --> 06:19:46,259
It's harvest, yeah.

3544
06:19:46,259 --> 06:19:46,979
What beauty?

3545
06:19:46,979 --> 06:19:47,619
How?

3546
06:19:53,650 --> 06:19:54,930
What do you mean permanently died?

3547
06:19:54,930 --> 06:19:56,130
But I'm alive.

3548
06:19:56,130 --> 06:19:57,639
Thoughts.

3549
06:19:58,439 --> 06:20:00,279
You never even knew I existed either.

3550
06:20:03,700 --> 06:20:07,000
Zagreus, he even kept your name.

3551
06:20:07,720 --> 06:20:10,279
How can this be?

3552
06:20:10,279 --> 06:20:18,500
You live, fate, my son.

3553
06:20:18,500 --> 06:20:19,299
Settle down, mom.

3554
06:20:19,299 --> 06:20:20,419
I'm not Frankenstein.

3555
06:20:20,979 --> 06:20:22,130
I'm a boy.

3556
06:20:22,130 --> 06:20:22,770
I'm a real boy.

3557
06:20:31,159 --> 06:20:32,040
Shut up, Jerma.

3558
06:20:33,250 --> 06:20:35,169
In short, I beat him finally,

3559
06:20:35,169 --> 06:20:38,130
though he did everything he could to prevent our meeting here like this.

3560
06:20:38,930 --> 06:20:41,169
But there's something he wanted me to tell you in the end.

3561
06:20:41,970 --> 06:20:44,610
He said to tell you Cerberus is doing very well.

3562
06:20:45,490 --> 06:20:49,439
Ah, he told you that, did he?

3563
06:20:50,159 --> 06:20:50,799
That's good.

3564
06:20:51,360 --> 06:20:52,000
That's good.

3565
06:20:53,060 --> 06:20:55,139
Though, tell me something, Zagreus.

3566
06:20:55,139 --> 06:20:57,299
How is it that you found me?

3567
06:20:58,020 --> 06:21:01,220
To have journeyed all this way, I scarce believe it.

3568
06:21:02,659 --> 06:21:03,299
Zagreus?

3569
06:21:04,259 --> 06:21:04,819
I don't know.

3570
06:21:04,819 --> 06:21:06,340
Just walked over here.

3571
06:21:07,139 --> 06:21:07,700
Oh, it's...

3572
06:21:08,419 --> 06:21:09,779
Guess I'm just a little tired.

3573
06:21:09,779 --> 06:21:10,180
That's all.

3574
06:21:10,180 --> 06:21:11,139
I have a live sickness.

3575
06:21:11,139 --> 06:21:13,139
...accustomed to the weather, as I think you call it.

3576
06:21:13,779 --> 06:21:15,139
I definitely have a live sickness.

3577
06:21:15,139 --> 06:21:16,020
I'm not supposed to be alive.

3578
06:21:18,479 --> 06:21:20,000
No, that isn't it.

3579
06:21:20,000 --> 06:21:23,590
It's that you cannot stay here.

3580
06:21:25,330 --> 06:21:26,369
You can't stay here.

3581
06:21:27,990 --> 06:21:31,029
Really, you're kicking me out?

3582
06:21:31,029 --> 06:21:31,590
Why?

3583
06:21:31,590 --> 06:21:34,360
The fates are cruel, Zagreus.

3584
06:21:35,250 --> 06:21:36,450
You're bound to that place.

3585
06:21:37,569 --> 06:21:38,610
Same as your father.

3586
06:21:39,830 --> 06:21:42,549
So they would have us say goodbye for now.

3587
06:21:44,259 --> 06:21:46,180
My heart soars knowing you live.

3588
06:21:47,060 --> 06:21:50,229
But then it breaks that our time together was so brief.

3589
06:21:51,880 --> 06:21:55,060
No, I can come back.

3590
06:21:55,060 --> 06:21:55,779
I can come back.

3591
06:21:56,419 --> 06:21:57,619
Now that I found you, he...

3592
06:21:58,580 --> 06:21:59,860
Maybe he'll just let me come back.

3593
06:21:59,860 --> 06:22:02,819
So I have to fight my way out of Hades

3594
06:22:04,389 --> 06:22:06,869
to hang out with my mother for 15 minutes a day.

3595
06:22:11,919 --> 06:22:13,439
You tell him I demand it.

3596
06:22:14,520 --> 06:22:16,840
And I demand he also tell me how come he,

3597
06:22:17,639 --> 06:22:18,919
or for that matter Nyx,

3598
06:22:19,720 --> 06:22:21,400
never sent notice that you lived?

3599
06:22:22,849 --> 06:22:24,849
Olympus is all rife with schemers.

3600
06:22:25,490 --> 06:22:28,450
But I was so naive to think that they were different.

3601
06:22:32,259 --> 06:22:35,169
I'm telling him I feel awful.

3602
06:22:35,970 --> 06:22:38,000
I have to go.

3603
06:22:39,270 --> 06:22:41,430
Does it cut scene us or do I have to actually walk back?

3604
06:22:41,430 --> 06:22:42,869
The stick shall take you then.

3605
06:22:43,430 --> 06:22:45,009
Oh, Zagreus.

3606
06:22:46,419 --> 06:22:47,459
Farewell, my son.

3607
06:22:48,020 --> 06:22:50,340
Won't you come back to me?

3608
06:22:51,139 --> 06:22:54,900
When you are able, please come back.

3609
06:22:54,900 --> 06:22:57,380
I shall be waiting here.

3610
06:23:07,319 --> 06:23:10,360
Can't hold on.

3611
06:23:10,360 --> 06:23:15,380
This is a pretty sick prank by dad.

3612
06:23:15,380 --> 06:23:21,250
Mother, I have to get back there.

3613
06:23:21,250 --> 06:23:23,250
House of Hades, ha-ha, hooray.

3614
06:23:23,250 --> 06:23:24,689
You've finally returned.

3615
06:23:24,689 --> 06:23:25,970
Oh, hi, yeah.

3616
06:23:29,720 --> 06:23:30,360
That was fun.

3617
06:23:30,360 --> 06:23:31,720
You are late, boy.

3618
06:23:31,720 --> 06:23:35,169
Does he remember that I killed him?

3619
06:23:36,389 --> 06:23:37,830
No. Wait, what?

3620
06:23:37,830 --> 06:23:40,549
I vanquished you in single combat and finally found mother

3621
06:23:40,549 --> 06:23:41,750
and that's all you have to say to me.

3622
06:23:44,529 --> 06:23:45,750
Nonsense.

3623
06:23:46,310 --> 06:23:48,470
Don't you think I would recall such an event?

3624
06:23:50,529 --> 06:23:51,490
You can't be serious.

3625
06:23:51,490 --> 06:23:52,770
So I went back in time or something?

3626
06:23:52,770 --> 06:23:53,569
It never happened.

3627
06:23:54,209 --> 06:23:56,290
She wants answers same as I do.

3628
06:23:56,290 --> 06:23:57,569
She demands you let me pass.

3629
06:23:58,369 --> 06:23:59,409
Let me go to her again.

3630
06:24:01,319 --> 06:24:01,819
Silence.

3631
06:24:02,680 --> 06:24:04,360
This discussion is over.

3632
06:24:05,319 --> 06:24:08,279
I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge

3633
06:24:08,279 --> 06:24:09,799
your overwrought imagination.

3634
06:24:09,799 --> 06:24:12,130
Gaslighting, right?

3635
06:24:12,130 --> 06:24:14,290
I know where we can continue this discussion then.

3636
06:24:14,930 --> 06:24:16,369
Got to kill him a bunch more times.

3637
06:24:18,639 --> 06:24:23,060
Well, might as well just get the fountain upgrade.

3638
06:24:23,939 --> 06:24:25,490
Hey, I'm going to call it here.

3639
06:24:25,490 --> 06:24:26,770
I like the sound of this one here.

3640
06:24:26,770 --> 06:24:28,209
That's a good place to stop for the day.

3641
06:24:28,930 --> 06:24:30,799
But I'm going to do my upgrades first.

3642
06:24:31,439 --> 06:24:35,279
Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous

3643
06:24:35,279 --> 06:24:36,319
music stand, my friend?

3644
06:24:37,200 --> 06:24:39,599
Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?

3645
06:24:41,619 --> 06:24:42,340
Go to the quests?

3646
06:24:42,340 --> 06:24:46,180
Yeah, I'm going to go make sure I do all my tasks.

3647
06:24:46,180 --> 06:24:47,459
I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus.

3648
06:24:48,500 --> 06:24:49,619
Tell me something.

3649
06:24:49,619 --> 06:24:51,700
How could it play your music when you're not even here?

3650
06:24:53,759 --> 06:24:56,479
Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend?

3651
06:24:57,279 --> 06:25:00,479
Know only that whenever it produces music for your listening

3652
06:25:00,479 --> 06:25:04,319
enjoyment that the sound you hear is coming from my soul.

3653
06:25:07,200 --> 06:25:09,680
Amazing and a bit unsettling.

3654
06:25:09,680 --> 06:25:10,400
Bye, Nyx.

3655
06:25:10,400 --> 06:25:13,520
Your father felt to you as once his father felt to him.

3656
06:25:14,400 --> 06:25:16,479
Although you were substantially more merciful.

3657
06:25:17,360 --> 06:25:19,680
I know it is a bitter victory at best.

3658
06:25:19,680 --> 06:25:20,639
Bye, Daedalus.

3659
06:25:20,639 --> 06:25:24,240
Tell me what transpired subsequently that you have returned.

3660
06:25:25,040 --> 06:25:26,479
Did you locate your birth mother?

3661
06:25:27,540 --> 06:25:27,939
I did.

3662
06:25:28,819 --> 06:25:29,380
She was there.

3663
06:25:30,020 --> 06:25:31,619
She was where you said she'd be.

3664
06:25:32,259 --> 06:25:33,459
And more than I imagined.

3665
06:25:33,459 --> 06:25:35,810
But I had so little time with her.

3666
06:25:36,770 --> 06:25:38,369
I can't survive up there for very long.

3667
06:25:38,930 --> 06:25:41,569
Why didn't you tell me I'd just die no matter what?

3668
06:25:42,900 --> 06:25:43,939
Oh, my child.

3669
06:25:44,900 --> 06:25:48,520
I say this seldomly, but I did not know.

3670
06:25:48,520 --> 06:25:52,840
It is through for views to believe that the service would

3671
06:25:52,840 --> 06:25:54,200
have such an effect on you.

3672
06:25:55,080 --> 06:25:58,200
But it seems you share your father's fate after all.

3673
06:25:58,200 --> 06:26:00,419
Oh, he's playing cheers to you.

3674
06:26:01,459 --> 06:26:03,139
I've really got to take a bow on this one.

3675
06:26:03,779 --> 06:26:07,750
Every time he loses with cheers to you, he gets really sad

3676
06:26:07,750 --> 06:26:10,150
because that's supposed to give him super powers.

3677
06:26:11,880 --> 06:26:12,360
Right.

3678
06:26:12,360 --> 06:26:18,630
My father's fate, but he was smugly waiting for me up there

3679
06:26:18,630 --> 06:26:20,709
and seemed quite healthy all in all.

3680
06:26:20,709 --> 06:26:24,369
Though maybe the farther we get from this realm, the worse we get.

3681
06:26:25,409 --> 06:26:26,369
Because he.

3682
06:26:26,369 --> 06:26:31,729
So I now presume you are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine.

3683
06:26:32,610 --> 06:26:33,409
Tell me something.

3684
06:26:34,130 --> 06:26:37,889
If you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time,

3685
06:26:38,770 --> 06:26:40,610
would you still make the journey to her there?

3686
06:26:43,909 --> 06:26:44,409
Yes.

3687
06:26:44,950 --> 06:26:46,069
Yes, I would.

3688
06:26:46,069 --> 06:26:47,590
I had so many questions left for her.

3689
06:26:49,299 --> 06:26:51,380
Then go and ask them, child.

3690
06:26:52,340 --> 06:26:54,659
Settle your resolve and find her there again.

3691
06:26:55,599 --> 06:26:59,200
And use well what brief time you have with one another whilst you can.

3692
06:27:00,080 --> 06:27:01,040
As mortals do.

3693
06:27:01,759 --> 06:27:03,599
What does Tumblr game even mean?

3694
06:27:05,680 --> 06:27:06,959
I don't know what that's supposed to mean.

3695
06:27:07,919 --> 06:27:11,430
I haven't given Nick's a gift.

3696
06:27:14,930 --> 06:27:17,569
Zagreus, please tell me that the rumors are untrue.

3697
06:27:18,209 --> 06:27:19,650
You really vanquished him.

3698
06:27:19,650 --> 06:27:20,209
Devonka Trump.

3699
06:27:20,209 --> 06:27:22,049
Have you completely lost your mind?

3700
06:27:22,049 --> 06:27:23,970
You're going to destroy this blasted house.

3701
06:27:25,700 --> 06:27:26,819
Holy shit, that took a long.

3702
06:27:26,819 --> 06:27:27,779
That was holy shit.

3703
06:27:27,779 --> 06:27:28,419
That took forever.

3704
06:27:28,419 --> 06:27:29,939
I was trying to figure out who it sounded like.

3705
06:27:30,659 --> 06:27:33,860
Make father had it coming for some time.

3706
06:27:33,860 --> 06:27:36,340
What's your concern besides the house is safe.

3707
06:27:37,939 --> 06:27:40,099
He's not going to take this lying down.

3708
06:27:40,099 --> 06:27:42,819
He'll find some way to take it out on you on all of us.

3709
06:27:43,540 --> 06:27:44,580
You watch yourself.

3710
06:27:44,580 --> 06:27:45,459
All of us will pay.

3711
06:27:46,740 --> 06:27:50,419
I will not let that happen.

3712
06:27:50,419 --> 06:27:57,349
I didn't get a new fish.

3713
06:27:59,139 --> 06:28:00,020
Take that back.

3714
06:28:00,740 --> 06:28:01,990
It's a great voice.

3715
06:28:01,990 --> 06:28:03,750
It's a great voice acting.

3716
06:28:03,750 --> 06:28:08,479
It's time for me to give my final review of the game.

3717
06:28:09,200 --> 06:28:10,240
Voice acting?

3718
06:28:10,240 --> 06:28:11,200
Incredible.

3719
06:28:11,200 --> 06:28:13,250
A 98 out of 100.

3720
06:28:13,250 --> 06:28:14,849
Very, like, just across the board.

3721
06:28:14,849 --> 06:28:15,889
Just fantastic.

3722
06:28:15,889 --> 06:28:17,169
All the characters are perfectly cast.

3723
06:28:17,169 --> 06:28:20,400
It's fucking, it's phenomenal.

3724
06:28:20,400 --> 06:28:22,080
Two, the combat.

3725
06:28:22,080 --> 06:28:23,009
It's great.

3726
06:28:23,009 --> 06:28:24,209
It trickles you new weapons.

3727
06:28:24,209 --> 06:28:24,930
You can play with them.

3728
06:28:24,930 --> 06:28:26,049
You find the ones you like.

3729
06:28:26,049 --> 06:28:28,130
Then there's still ones that I don't even have.

3730
06:28:28,130 --> 06:28:28,610
Very good.

3731
06:28:28,610 --> 06:28:29,090
Very awesome.

3732
06:28:29,729 --> 06:28:33,459
The upgrade system is, whoa.

3733
06:28:34,400 --> 06:28:35,040
All the combos.

3734
06:28:35,040 --> 06:28:35,840
The duos.

3735
06:28:35,840 --> 06:28:36,799
The rarity.

3736
06:28:36,799 --> 06:28:38,400
It gives you the rarity itch.

3737
06:28:38,400 --> 06:28:40,240
Where, oh, RNG, I got a fucking epic.

3738
06:28:40,240 --> 06:28:40,959
All right, cool.

3739
06:28:40,959 --> 06:28:41,439
Perfect.

3740
06:28:41,439 --> 06:28:41,840
Great.

3741
06:28:41,840 --> 06:28:42,720
That's a 10.

3742
06:28:42,720 --> 06:28:48,720
The enemies that can shoot you across the map.

3743
06:28:48,720 --> 06:28:50,740
That's a 4.

3744
06:28:50,740 --> 06:28:52,159
I don't like that.

3745
06:28:52,159 --> 06:28:57,919
But that has, like, 1% weighted on the index here.

3746
06:28:59,779 --> 06:29:06,520
Sometimes it can get a little confusing.

3747
06:29:06,520 --> 06:29:07,720
There's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.

3748
06:29:07,720 --> 06:29:08,840
You can get lost.

3749
06:29:08,840 --> 06:29:14,119
I like the areas.

3750
06:29:14,119 --> 06:29:15,080
I like the art style.

3751
06:29:16,080 --> 06:29:16,639
Looks cool.

3752
06:29:16,639 --> 06:29:18,799
I hope they have Greek and Roman mythology.

3753
06:29:18,799 --> 06:29:19,680
It's cool.

3754
06:29:19,680 --> 06:29:29,159
The 94.

3755
06:29:29,159 --> 06:29:40,040
And it's not over.

3756
06:29:40,040 --> 06:29:40,439
Oh, I know.

3757
06:29:41,000 --> 06:29:43,060
I know that.

3758
06:29:43,060 --> 06:29:45,970
Weapon room or no balls.

3759
06:29:45,970 --> 06:29:46,930
I'm going to walk over there.

3760
06:29:46,930 --> 06:29:47,409
Just hold on.

3761
06:29:47,409 --> 06:29:57,119
There's only a matter of time, I suppose.

3762
06:29:57,119 --> 06:29:57,599
Wow.

3763
06:29:57,599 --> 06:29:57,919
That's...

3764
06:29:59,040 --> 06:30:00,240
I broke free after all.

3765
06:30:00,240 --> 06:30:01,520
Okay, that's how you get that.

3766
06:30:03,060 --> 06:30:03,700
Thousand.

3767
06:30:03,700 --> 06:30:04,580
Holy shit.

3768
06:30:04,580 --> 06:30:05,459
Okay, hold on.

3769
06:30:06,099 --> 06:30:08,310
Nothing else, right?

3770
06:30:11,319 --> 06:30:12,520
14 out of 30.

3771
06:30:14,529 --> 06:30:15,330
Renovations.

3772
06:30:15,970 --> 06:30:16,369
Okay.

3773
06:30:17,169 --> 06:30:18,389
What am I still missing here?

3774
06:30:22,470 --> 06:30:24,930
I need more keys.

3775
06:30:24,930 --> 06:30:28,709
Where's Thanatos?

3776
06:30:29,270 --> 06:30:32,389
He's asleep.

3777
06:30:32,389 --> 06:30:34,869
I don't know.

3778
06:30:34,869 --> 06:30:38,680
The exit.

3779
06:30:39,000 --> 06:30:40,119
Once in a while, pal,

3780
06:30:40,119 --> 06:30:42,040
you're going to see a real fancy bozo

3781
06:30:42,040 --> 06:30:43,400
try to ruin your good time.

3782
06:30:43,400 --> 06:30:45,479
You'll know him because he's glowing like a light.

3783
06:30:45,479 --> 06:30:47,560
But that's his special armor, see?

3784
06:30:47,560 --> 06:30:49,000
You got to punch right through it.

3785
06:30:49,000 --> 06:30:50,599
He's going to shrug you off until you do.

3786
06:30:51,319 --> 06:30:53,119
For a good time,

3787
06:30:53,119 --> 06:30:55,599
beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest.

3788
06:30:56,880 --> 06:31:00,709
Let's try it.

3789
06:31:01,349 --> 06:31:01,990
Exagriff.

3790
06:31:01,990 --> 06:31:02,470
The rail abatement.

3791
06:31:02,470 --> 06:31:03,270
Exagriff.

3792
06:31:03,270 --> 06:31:04,790
Annihilate all who oppose me.

3793
06:31:08,470 --> 06:31:12,680
Wow.

3794
06:31:13,240 --> 06:31:14,529
Wait, it has bullets?

3795
06:31:15,330 --> 06:31:17,759
Hold them and release to bombard.

3796
06:31:27,360 --> 06:31:28,080
That's awesome.

3797
06:31:30,069 --> 06:31:30,950
That reloads.

3798
06:31:34,599 --> 06:31:36,119
Push in R to reload?

3799
06:31:36,840 --> 06:31:42,869
Can I change that keybinding if I ever wanted to do that?

3800
06:31:42,869 --> 06:31:43,830
I don't like that keybind.

3801
06:31:44,630 --> 06:31:46,240
It's kind of, it's awkward.

3802
06:31:47,119 --> 06:31:55,270
It's kind of like the bow and the gloves combined together.

3803
06:31:55,270 --> 06:32:07,009
Look at the window.

3804
06:32:07,009 --> 06:32:09,119
What the hell does this say?

3805
06:32:09,119 --> 06:32:09,599
Prepare.

3806
06:32:11,889 --> 06:32:14,610
Congratulations, your deeds have compelled Lord Hades

3807
06:32:14,610 --> 06:32:15,970
to serve you a pact of punishment.

3808
06:32:15,970 --> 06:32:17,009
Here's how it works.

3809
06:32:17,009 --> 06:32:19,240
The pact can make escaping more difficult

3810
06:32:19,240 --> 06:32:21,319
via various nasty conditions.

3811
06:32:21,319 --> 06:32:24,919
Each condition you accept adds some heat to your heat gauge.

3812
06:32:24,919 --> 06:32:26,279
While your heat gauge is full,

3813
06:32:26,279 --> 06:32:28,279
you can earn valuable bounties.

3814
06:32:28,279 --> 06:32:30,689
You earn one bounty

3815
06:32:30,689 --> 06:32:33,250
the first time you vanquish the boss of each underworld region

3816
06:32:33,250 --> 06:32:34,849
while your heat gauge is full.

3817
06:32:34,849 --> 06:32:36,319
Once you successfully escape,

3818
06:32:36,319 --> 06:32:38,240
you can earn more bounties if you turn up the heat.

3819
06:32:38,799 --> 06:32:40,799
And you can earn bounties for each weapon.

3820
06:32:40,799 --> 06:32:43,439
How much heat you need is per weapon as well.

3821
06:32:46,150 --> 06:32:48,819
Oops, can I take that off?

3822
06:32:49,459 --> 06:32:51,880
Choose any condition if you dare.

3823
06:32:51,880 --> 06:32:52,919
Get out using the,

3824
06:32:52,919 --> 06:32:55,240
get out using the adamant rail.

3825
06:32:56,630 --> 06:32:58,709
All prices are 40% more.

3826
06:32:58,709 --> 06:33:01,349
Don't need to turn the heat gauge so high to earn those bounties.

3827
06:33:01,349 --> 06:33:02,310
Heat gauge exceeded.

3828
06:33:03,189 --> 06:33:08,520
This is ridiculous.

3829
06:33:09,159 --> 06:33:22,000
You have fewer choices when offered boons, bounties.

3830
06:33:23,619 --> 06:33:25,299
I get one heat and I use the rail.

3831
06:33:25,299 --> 06:33:26,659
I get bounties for doing this.

3832
06:33:27,220 --> 06:33:28,419
Achilles or I'm going to die.

3833
06:33:28,419 --> 06:33:29,380
Um, hold on.

3834
06:33:29,380 --> 06:33:30,259
I got one to see.

3835
06:33:30,259 --> 06:33:30,979
Hold on a minute.

3836
06:33:31,540 --> 06:33:33,200
Just quiet.

3837
06:33:34,200 --> 06:33:34,919
Quiet.

3838
06:33:34,919 --> 06:33:36,439
Another day in Tartarus.

3839
06:33:36,439 --> 06:33:37,400
I demand silence.

3840
06:33:38,119 --> 06:33:41,569
I'm a punching.

3841
06:33:41,569 --> 06:33:42,049
Get off me.

3842
06:33:42,049 --> 06:33:42,549
Hey, room.

3843
06:33:47,729 --> 06:33:48,229
Let's see.

3844
06:33:48,849 --> 06:34:00,439
And I have so much.

3845
06:34:00,439 --> 06:34:01,560
I don't, I don't want to spend anything.

3846
06:34:02,200 --> 06:34:03,319
I'm not spending anything right now.

3847
06:34:04,040 --> 06:34:08,360
Come here.

3848
06:34:08,819 --> 06:34:09,720
Do, sir.

3849
06:34:09,720 --> 06:34:12,840
Turns out that I may be stopping back from time to time like this.

3850
06:34:12,840 --> 06:34:14,599
But please don't bother picking up my room.

3851
06:34:17,000 --> 06:34:20,720
Sure, but I'll just keep an eye on things in there for the time.

3852
06:34:20,720 --> 06:34:22,080
In case you change your mind.

3853
06:34:22,080 --> 06:34:23,599
Um, so.

3854
06:34:23,599 --> 06:34:26,389
What's this deal?

3855
06:34:26,389 --> 06:34:27,830
Um, goodbye.

3856
06:34:27,830 --> 06:34:29,029
I'm going to go talk to Achilles.

3857
06:34:29,029 --> 06:34:32,150
Oh, that guy is going to like smash his laptop into the ground.

3858
06:34:32,150 --> 06:34:32,790
Here.

3859
06:34:32,790 --> 06:34:34,150
I found her, sir.

3860
06:34:34,229 --> 06:34:39,479
My mother, she's alive and well, and I just couldn't stay up there for very long.

3861
06:34:39,479 --> 06:34:40,520
I have to get back to her.

3862
06:34:42,040 --> 06:34:43,240
You really made it all the way.

3863
06:34:43,240 --> 06:34:46,340
You must have gotten past your father.

3864
06:34:46,340 --> 06:34:47,619
That's amazing, lad.

3865
06:34:47,619 --> 06:34:49,720
But wait, what was she like?

3866
06:34:49,720 --> 06:34:50,680
What happened to you there?

3867
06:34:52,369 --> 06:34:54,290
She was, she was great.

3868
06:34:55,009 --> 06:34:57,810
Nothing like father, more like you a little bit, I guess.

3869
06:34:58,610 --> 06:35:01,810
Though being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me.

3870
06:35:02,610 --> 06:35:05,009
Even without the wretches of the underworld trying to do me in.

3871
06:35:07,330 --> 06:35:08,849
But then you had a little time at least.

3872
06:35:09,650 --> 06:35:11,970
Sounds like you have unfinished business with her there.

3873
06:35:11,970 --> 06:35:13,009
You got to her this once.

3874
06:35:13,650 --> 06:35:15,409
Surely you're able to again, isn't that right?

3875
06:35:18,759 --> 06:35:19,159
It is.

3876
06:35:19,799 --> 06:35:20,840
I have to speak with her.

3877
06:35:22,279 --> 06:35:23,400
Hey, why did you want, what was,

3878
06:35:25,319 --> 06:35:26,840
why did you want me to do that so bad?

3879
06:35:29,810 --> 06:35:33,090
That was just a regular, just sort of lore conversation.

3880
06:35:36,470 --> 06:35:37,430
Because we like him.

3881
06:35:38,150 --> 06:35:38,650
Oh.

3882
06:35:39,700 --> 06:35:40,900
All right, I'm going to call it here.

3883
06:35:42,740 --> 06:35:46,229
Uh, I might still play this next week.

3884
06:35:46,229 --> 06:35:47,590
We're going to change tomorrow.

3885
06:35:47,590 --> 06:35:48,310
We're going to play something else.

3886
06:35:48,310 --> 06:35:49,430
Chat's choices tomorrow.

3887
06:35:49,430 --> 06:35:56,680
Thanks for watching everybody.

3888
06:35:56,680 --> 06:35:59,080
I will give you a list of games to vote on.

3889
06:35:59,080 --> 06:36:01,759
There'll be a poll tomorrow pre-stream.

3890
06:36:01,759 --> 06:36:05,029
Stream will be tomorrow around the same time it started today.

3891
06:36:05,029 --> 06:36:07,029
Between somewhere around 1.30 or 2.

3892
06:36:07,029 --> 06:36:08,610
I'll just set it to 2.

3893
06:36:11,159 --> 06:36:12,520
And I'll see you later.

3894
06:36:12,520 --> 06:36:13,990
Let's do the credits.

3895
06:36:14,630 --> 06:36:19,080
I missed a few subs here.

3896
06:36:19,080 --> 06:36:19,959
We had Bo.

3897
06:36:19,959 --> 06:36:21,880
