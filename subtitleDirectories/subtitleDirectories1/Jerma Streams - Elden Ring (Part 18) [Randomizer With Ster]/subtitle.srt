1
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Hello, how's everybody doing?

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,019
Yeah, we're very on time today.

3
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,020
That's what happens when you spend

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020
two hours troubleshooting

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
mods, and you get it

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,020
to a point where, wait, oh,

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,799
he's talking, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

8
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,799
Three, two, one, what are you doing?

9
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,799
Hey, how's it going?

10
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,799
Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,799
People said they're shocked that we're

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,799
actually on time today. But what I was saying

13
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,799
is, we spent like

14
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:55,799
two hours getting this to work yesterday,

15
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,799
so it's gonna work now.

16
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,799
Yeah, it works now. We did it.

17
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,799
We double checked. We crossed our T's.

18
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,040
Everything's good.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Your guy needs some pants.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,340
How'd you sleep?

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,579
Not enough.

22
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,579
No? Oh, that's right.

23
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,579
You got up and went to the gym, right?

24
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,579
I did. There was a bit of pumping

25
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,579
this morning. I actually got back like

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,579
an hour ago. Are you serious?

27
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,590
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,590
So you got energy

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,590
then? You're high energy then?

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,590
It's the opposite because it's like

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,590
a two hour session of like

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,590
now I have no energy.

33
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,590
I'm energized for some Elden Ring.

34
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,590
Okay. Well, so am I.

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,090
So you ready? Yeah.

36
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,780
What adventure lay forth

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,780
before a fun this eve?

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
I don't know, but should we

39
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,909
get a recap?

40
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,469
Sure. Okay. Yeah, because

41
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,469
I had imagined people on my stream weren't watching

42
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,469
until 2 a.m. last night in the like nine hour

43
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:58,469
ring session. That's really true.

44
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,469
So a lot of people that left. Here's a little bit of a recap.

45
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:04,120
Ah!

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
What the fuck?

47
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,939
I disconnected.

48
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,300
Oh, I'm back.

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
I'll re-invite you.

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,120
Okay. So that's pretty much

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,680
all that happened yesterday.

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
We did get

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,430
up to Ray of Lucaria.

54
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,430
But if you don't know, we're doing randomizer.

55
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,129
So nothing is

56
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,500
the way that it's supposed to be.

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I don't know randomizer, but every item is randomized

58
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,740
and every enemy is randomized.

59
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,099
We got stuck with, I don't even

60
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,099
know the character's name, Placid

61
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,099
Deuce? Placid Deuce?

62
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,099
What's the... Placid Deucex

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,099
is the boss in Reina's...

64
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,099
Placid Deucex is the Queen of

65
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,099
the Moon. Yes.

66
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,099
He's the Queen and he still has two phases

67
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,659
and his second phase is Loretta.

68
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,659
But him teleporting through walls

69
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,030
was hard. We didn't beat it. So we got to

70
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,030
farm up. You have like

71
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,030
a deleted finger plus six weapon that I

72
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,979
can't give you. So we just need...

73
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,979
We're going to go around and do some catacombs or

74
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,979
like a little mini boss encounter

75
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,280
stuff. So we skipped... Honestly we skipped

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
a lot. We basically ran straight to

77
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,460
Lucaria. We have to... The wall right now

78
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,460
for us is... And we're not

79
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
going to reset. We're not going to reset. Do you want to know the wall

80
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,460
for me? Is that

81
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
your name is Mestrong and mine is

82
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
Mesmart because I am the spellcaster.

83
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,949
I have no spells.

84
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:31,580
I have not found a spell. You've been

85
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,580
casting spells though. It is

86
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,710
a weapon art but I don't actually have

87
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,710
a spell. But it still scales off of how

88
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,710
intelligent you are. You have to be really smart

89
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,710
to do it. I want you to be on my side that I

90
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
haven't got any spells. Like what if I had

91
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,710
Crystal Laser Beam Supreme? What if we

92
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,710
go into a catacomb and we get Crystal Supreme?

93
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,719
Yeah. But what's up with your title by the

94
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,250
way? Somebody? I didn't want to name

95
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,250
drop. I thought it would be better to just write

96
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,250
somebody. I wrote your name.

97
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,250
I wrote Sturr.

98
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,490
Oh you're going to name drop like that? Like oh you're

99
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,490
just going to get all the viewers because all he's playing with Sturr?

100
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,199
You know, I will

101
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,889
say, years ago

102
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,889
that was actually a great

103
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,579
idea. Those of you that don't know, back in

104
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,259
the TF2 days, Sturr was

105
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,620
big, big deal.

106
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,300
And if you put Sturr

107
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
in your title.

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Alright, I'm playing with Derma.

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
If it was like oh dude, TF2

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
man, TF2 is like such a fun

111
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,300
game. Live commentary with

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Sturr. I'll click this one.

113
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:45,720
A lot of the newer

114
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,720
viewers here maybe don't know. Sturr

115
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,199
was a TF2.

116
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,439
Yeah. If you don't know

117
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,439
you're getting the like way

118
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,439
washed up Sturr. You don't even know.

119
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:00,839
I don't think so. You don't know what you missed.

120
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,139
I think this Sturr

121
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,509
is pretty damn good.

122
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,509
He's a good guy.

123
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:09,689
All the Sturrs across the last

124
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,689
10 to 15 years have been good.

125
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,689
He doesn't afraid of anything.

126
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,930
No. I like each

127
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,899
Sturr. But anyways.

128
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:24,899
Anyways, onto adventure.

129
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,720
Did we kill the magmorm?

130
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
We did kill the magmorm at the urn tree. I know there's

131
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
down by the beach there's like a sewer

132
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,600
we can go down. Oh, by the way, I

133
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
played off stream and I know a lot of people are going to

134
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
yell at me. You fucking

135
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
piece of garbage. You human

136
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,779
garbage. But there's a very

137
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,779
hold on. I didn't do anything

138
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,779
though.

139
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,269
Get the fuck out of here!

140
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,790
It's one of these things.

141
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,790
Did I just hit him across the game?

142
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,800
Don't be afraid, man. Hey, hey, come on.

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Hey, you and me. Hey, you and me. We're starting a new

144
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,040
arc right now. Here it is.

145
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd rather fight a boss.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,060
We ain't afraid. Look at that.

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
Alright, that arc is over. We can go on to

148
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,060
another one. That was like a pretty good one, I think.

149
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,060
Okay. Adventure 2.

150
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,639
I think we showed a lot of growth in that.

151
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,139
Why is there a golden sheep?

152
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,139
Is this rare? What is this? Oh, right.

153
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,139
Oh, a lightning sheep. That's right.

154
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:33,139
Okay. I thought there was like a randomizer

155
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:35,139
thing. I also never found where you get

156
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,050
that ability. I thought that

157
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,050
I thought there's gonna be runes or something.

158
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,350
Oh, anyway. Okay. So people ask

159
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,360
I may have

160
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
I just killed I killed the

161
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
same enemy like 10 times to get

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,899
some souls because I wanted to

163
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,899
get you. You have more levels than

164
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,899
me. But if you don't I wanted to buy

165
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,899
some smithing stones. What level are you right now?

166
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:03,189
I don't know. Why do you need to

167
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,189
I want to know what level you are. What level are you? And then I'll

168
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,189
tell you immediately after. I am 37.

169
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,430
You are as old as I am.

170
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm 49.

171
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,430
Okay. We evened out.

172
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,439
That's like not bad. But anyways

173
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,439
I

174
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,439
wanted to get stones

175
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,439
because

176
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,439
a big boy.

177
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,439
Oh, yeah.

178
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,680
Oh, yeah. I do

179
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
it all the time. And I think I'm pretty good at making

180
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
that joke. So I'm gonna do it whenever I get an opportunity

181
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,949
to. Let's help this boy.

182
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,629
Wait.

183
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:46,629
Could I could could I have duplicated

184
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,629
I could have duplicated shit, right?

185
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,629
Yeah. Oh my

186
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,629
God. All right. That's why we're saying

187
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,629
not to do that. I remember

188
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:56,629
it being well, I know this was a long time

189
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:58,629
ago, like a year ago when randomizers

190
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,629
burst out all of my

191
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:02,629
duplicating my ship with

192
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,629
super glitch. Do we have we have another one of those

193
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:06,629
like poison spitter teleporter

194
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,629
pieces of shit on me?

195
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:11,189
It's funny

196
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,189
that you said that. I know exactly what that meant.

197
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,870
And I'm poisoned.

198
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,870
Sorry, just poison is not that bad.

199
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:33,080
You just heal through it.

200
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
What's that character's name? Royal

201
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,090
what's the character's name?

202
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,090
The character? The thing that we just saw.

203
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,669
That enemy? I have no idea.

204
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,980
Royal Revenant.

205
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,860
Royal Revenant. That sounds like a League

206
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
of Legends item.

207
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,269
I think the I

208
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,269
think this is random. Is it random?

209
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,509
You get like an item in here too.

210
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,509
I can't remember. Who knows?

211
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:07,460
That felt like it lasted

212
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
a long time. All right. So what's in here?

213
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:20,840
Oh, look at you.

214
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
I still haven't found a remembrance.

215
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,690
I am so sorry about

216
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,690
this. I have to apologize immediately.

217
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,690
But I need to get

218
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,690
I need to be in a safe spot.

219
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,690
Because I

220
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,690
auto needs to go outside. Follow

221
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,950
me. So I can't really follow

222
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,950
you. We're going to the shack. We're going

223
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,950
straight up to the shack because there's a merchant here

224
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,950
and then you can

225
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,950
You can go off and care for your

226
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,950
doggy. I don't know where you're going.

227
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,950
Straight west.

228
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,950
Straight west. The game really does not

229
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,950
like sometimes when you get on your horse.

230
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,950
I think it's when we transition

231
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,919
areas. I don't know. Yeah. You kind

232
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,919
of desync for me too. I'll just follow

233
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,919
you. I got to let auto up.

234
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,919
Let's get to a spot where I can

235
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,919
not going to take me long. Maybe

236
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,159
less than five minutes.

237
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:19,580
Less than two minutes. Show auto.

238
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,940
Maybe. You're good.

239
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,769
All right. I'm just going to if I just sit here

240
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,259
while that screw anything up. No, you're good.

241
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,080
All right. Oh, also I got another

242
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,149
sacred tear accidentally. I

243
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,389
love that for you.

244
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,059
All right. I'll bear it back. I'm just literally

245
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,059
going to leave this open. My merchants selling

246
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,059
two different seed bed curses.

247
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm not even going to mute my microphone.

248
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I mean, I'll mute it over here. But I just

249
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
you know what? No, no, no, no. No, I'm going to mute you too.

250
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I've

251
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
learned over the years.

252
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Probably a good idea. I don't want to say

253
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
anything weird, but I'm going to feel pressured like I

254
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
have to. Any time that you are under

255
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
pressure to like talk,

256
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
you just talk and you

257
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
just you know what? I'm just going to say whatever the fuck

258
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm going to say. Hey, guys, see

259
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
that. So I did. He's gone.

260
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
I got rid of him.

261
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
I'll be right back. I'm not going to put actually, you know

262
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
I'm going to put a BRB screen. People can be like, what the hell is going on?

263
00:11:15,820 --> 00:16:45,340
Right back. Yeah.

264
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:53,830
Telster.

265
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:56,309
It's cringe. Yeah.

266
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,309
That's the first thing people hear.

267
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,879
It's cringe. All right. So

268
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,079
hold on.

269
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,920
Yeah. Sorry. I had to take Otto out.

270
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,289
He's good. He's relaxing in the other room.

271
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,289
Was he and is he

272
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:15,849
a good dog? Yes. Okay.

273
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,599
That's good to know. Of course he is.

274
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,740
What's the worst thing he's ever

275
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:25,500
done? I don't think

276
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,990
there really is anything. He's

277
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,990
a really good boy. He is.

278
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,990
He just, I remember he doesn't

279
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,990
like do anything. He just kind of chills. He just kind

280
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,990
of just hangs around. He kind of hangs

281
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,619
out. Never like pooped in your bed or anything?

282
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,700
Ate too many Oreos?

283
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,130
No, my dog has never pooped in my

284
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,670
bed. Oh, my dog

285
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,670
has. Bro, your stream title

286
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,319
is boring. But who

287
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:59,349
cares?

288
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,349
Randomizer gaming with stir.

289
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,349
See, that's how I felt too. Like just like

290
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,349
game with name is like the

291
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:07,349
worst title. It is, but that's what yours

292
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,150
is. Yeah, but I, you're

293
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,150
horsing in place. Okay. Well,

294
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,900
let's teleport somewhere. Okay.

295
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,730
Well, I want to, let's teleport to the shack.

296
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,730
Like, like, let's just actually teleport

297
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:25,849
to the shack that we're right next to. New

298
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:31,289
title? Name it swag gaming

299
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:37,180
with my man. Um,

300
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,980
I can't, I, again,

301
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,980
as, again, I was at the gym.

302
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,980
My brain is gone. I, there is

303
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
no cleverness. Ah, shit, I forgot.

304
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,150
You know what, do you know what

305
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,289
I really want? I do.

306
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:53,289
I want, I want

307
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,529
pads

308
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,700
for my elbows. Your elbows get just

309
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
absolutely fucked up like mine do.

310
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,390
Sitting in a chair. Uh, I have

311
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,390
like purchased like elbow

312
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,390
pads for my chair. Is it, is

313
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,390
that a, was it worth it? Yes,

314
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,630
100%. Because when you sit

315
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,630
here for long enough. I have a double layer.

316
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,599
I feel like it doesn't matter what kind of chair you

317
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,599
have. You always, if

318
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,599
you sit here with your elbows and your forearms

319
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,839
in the same spot, you kind of get that

320
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,079
like, you know what I mean? Like

321
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,079
this part of your elbow. You're gonna get that anyway, but like

322
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:31,819
it is way better with the pads.

323
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:33,819
Alright, let's move. Let's get started. It's been,

324
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:35,819
we've been stalling for 15-20 minutes.

325
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,819
Where, where do we get elbow pads?

326
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:42,420
Up this way? Wait, no, I want it, I

327
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
want it to go, there's like the, the swamp area

328
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,420
this way. I'm gonna put both headphones

329
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,329
in just for you. Well, then you're gonna

330
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:52,329
speech jam yourself because you can't hear yourself.

331
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:55,400
No, I actually, I've actually gotten a little bit better with

332
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,579
this. Oh, you've been training?

333
00:19:57,579 --> 00:19:59,579
Yeah, I've been putting both in recently. It still

334
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,579
kind of sucks, but it's fine.

335
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:13,589
Proud of you. Oh, I thought

336
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:16,920
there was an enemy in here. You're no

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
enemy. Whoa, but there's something here.

338
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,759
Oh, my God.

339
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,759
I am so lucky in this

340
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,759
run. I just got, I got millennia's

341
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,690
remembrance.

342
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,690
You fucker. I think mine

343
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,690
was like a lily, like just a flower.

344
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,440
That's one of the most expensive ones.

345
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
You should dupe it. Well, let's go clone it.

346
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
No, no, no. Oh, you

347
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
mean dupe it. Yeah, let's go do that. Let's go.

348
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,319
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

349
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,559
Saddle up. Oh, my God.

350
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,559
Is this actually gonna work?

351
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,559
Yeah. Am I gonna get like a hundred,

352
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:53,559
two hundred thousand souls right now? They

353
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,559
might, like the other one you had, the Radon one

354
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,559
you had, I think it was, might be reduced

355
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,559
in the amount. But yeah, you're about

356
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,559
to fucking. Oh, yes.

357
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,980
Escalate. Okay.

358
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,529
Get off the horse.

359
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:15,049
I can't get off the horse. I don't

360
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,049
think the horse is supposed to be able to come in here. I don't

361
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,289
think so either. Okay, there we

362
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,329
go. Oh, look at that.

363
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:26,500
Let's dupe it. Wait,

364
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
what does it give you if you didn't dupe it?

365
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
What? Who cares?

366
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm curious if the items are, should

367
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,279
be different. I think it's randomized.

368
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,279
Give one to stir.

369
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,279
Give one to stir. No, fuck that.

370
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,299
This is my shit. Okay.

371
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,299
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

372
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,180
No, use them both. How do you,

373
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,500
how do you, can I? Can you?

374
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,019
No, you can't. You cannot do it.

375
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,079
The true colors.

376
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,079
I remember this being an issue last time

377
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,079
and my chat was like, I can't remember.

378
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,079
But they were like, you can't do it at this one because it's

379
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,079
too high level of one, but you can do it at the other one.

380
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,960
I don't know, man.

381
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Alright, dude, I have, I have a hundred,

382
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
I have a hundred and ten thousand souls.

383
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,329
Alright, let's go die to like a

384
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,329
crab or something. Alright, yeah.

385
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,329
Do you want to go somewhere where it's really dangerous and like

386
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:22,329
should we put, want some steaks on this or

387
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,890
something? Because this is kinda not fair.

388
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,150
Yeah. There's another cave up

389
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,799
this way, I'm pretty sure. No, I'm not,

390
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,799
I'm kidding. We're not doing this. I'm

391
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,230
gonna go level up. Baby boy.

392
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,049
Little baby boy.

393
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:41,049
Oh my god, look what he's like

394
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:46,859
skidding.

395
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,859
What the fuck, what are you doing?

396
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm trying to do, I'm trying to do my laugh.

397
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,799
You're trying to do

398
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,799
your own laugh. Yeah, like that. You're doing an

399
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,799
impression of yourself laughing.

400
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:10,009
Okay, where did you go? Let's teleport back to the shack.

401
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:14,039
That was the Joker?

402
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,559
That was scary. It wasn't

403
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,140
scary.

404
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,630
Don't I do that? We're super

405
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,630
desynced. I just teleported to the shack.

406
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,130
Did you? I just said to.

407
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,130
I voted to warp. I voted

408
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,299
to warp. We're not

409
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,400
doing it.

410
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,460
It says it failed. Um, it says

411
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460
you are going into the ocean.

412
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,559
That was very weird. I arrested

413
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:55,559
the bonfire. There you are.

414
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,180
Okay, so this is important

415
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
because I'm about to level up the most,

416
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
this is probably the last amount of levels I'm gonna be able to do

417
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,809
for this character. It's not true.

418
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:07,690
Boom. First of all.

419
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,619
Okay. You have so much growth

420
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,619
ahead of you, honey. Okay, here we go.

421
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:20,099
I can only level up six times?

422
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,059
Alright, what's happening

423
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,299
here? I could do...

424
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:30,180
I'll dump it all in strength. Should I

425
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
do intelligence? Without any

426
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,490
thought, dump it all in strength. All

427
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,980
in intelligence to be able to use this

428
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,289
item correctly. Please, for the

429
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:41,289
love of God. Please, for the love of God.

430
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,450
Why does that weapon even need intelligence?

431
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:53,299
But wait a minute. Me

432
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,299
strong is not supposed to be doing this.

433
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,299
People are pissed right now.

434
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:59,990
You're being weird. You're not

435
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,819
being strong. People are fucking

436
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,420
pissed off. Alright, well here's the

437
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,240
deal. Here's the deal.

438
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
If I put

439
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
16 into intelligence, will I be

440
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
able to effectively use this weapon without

441
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
it being just like nerfed in my hands?

442
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,609
Or do I just

443
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,609
go boom into strength

444
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,609
and go upgrade this greatsword thing

445
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,910
that I have with default shit? Strength.

446
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,910
Strength. Strength. Strength. Me strong.

447
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,910
Me strong. Me strong. I'm doing

448
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,910
intelligence and you're copying me.

449
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,240
You're copying me. What do you guys think?

450
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,930
Do you think... 16

451
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,690
isn't smart. It's not.

452
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:54,059
What do you want me to do? I want you to put points

453
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,920
in vigor, actually. With all of the

454
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
plus to estus flasks you have.

455
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,019
Yeah. I think...

456
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:08,019
That way you don't die in like one hit to placidusax.

457
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,019
I am gonna do something right now

458
00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:12,019
and people are gonna be really saying,

459
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:14,019
dude, you blew it big time. But

460
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:16,259
here's what I'm gonna do. I blew it.

461
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:23,299
I blew it big time. I blew it.

462
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:27,210
I have to go to the blacksmith

463
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:33,140
because I blew it. You blew it?

464
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Where is the... No.

465
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
No. Not yet. What do you mean not yet?

466
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,380
Not yet. Hold.

467
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
What are you talking about? While we're here, I wanna do

468
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
one thing while we're here. But look, I have

469
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
this. I can just upgrade this to

470
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,380
probably plus 10, plus 15 right now because I have

471
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
a bunch of stones. And this is strength.

472
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,380
You're gonna have to wait. You're gonna learn a lesson

473
00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:00,470
in patience right now. So let's go.

474
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:10,200
Wherever you wanna go. Oh, look. Look. I found

475
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Millennia's Remembrance. Oh, look. I'm gonna get like

476
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
a plus 10. Oh, look. I have like 10 levels.

477
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,569
Fuck you, dude.

478
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,569
Where do you wanna go?

479
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,569
I wanna go to this graveyard that's like right here

480
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,569
with a whole bunch of items on it and a dragon guarding it.

481
00:27:22,569 --> 00:27:29,740
Oh, there is a dragon right there. Okay, cool.

482
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,509
Let chat seethe.

483
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,460
Okay. I got like two useless notes

484
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,910
off of this graveyard. I don't want

485
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,910
them to seethe, but I think that

486
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,460
I think it's worth it. He doesn't have a lot of health.

487
00:27:46,460 --> 00:28:02,650
We're so desynced in this area for

488
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,650
some reason. It might be just this spot.

489
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,210
It seems to go in weird cycles

490
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,210
where we desync, but then we get back to normal

491
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,210
for like two hours and then it desyncs for like an hour.

492
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,150
Oops.

493
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,339
We're fighting it, so...

494
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:40,119
Ow. Don't go in the

495
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:47,859
air. Dragon,

496
00:28:47,859 --> 00:29:06,619
you're being quenched.

497
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,920
Try hitting it.

498
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
We're in a weird spot. I'm not

499
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
the type of character that can fight a dragon that well.

500
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,400
Okay? Hey.

501
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,789
You just... Hey, let him seethe.

502
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:21,799
Seethe.

503
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,259
I hit it.

504
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:35,369
Looks to me like the dragon's dead.

505
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:37,799
What are you doing? I think we're desynced.

506
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,799
Silly is secret.

507
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:44,980
This is actually a good idea.

508
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,259
Although I didn't really get

509
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,890
much. Did you get anything good?

510
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,890
No, I got like notes

511
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,900
and cookbooks like usual.

512
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Notes, some cookbooks, some

513
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
runes. Okay, so that's

514
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
completed. Let's go ahead and mark that as

515
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,349
completed. I don't think that's normally

516
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:09,349
a boss. Do you

517
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,349
do you want to fight a boss?

518
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,660
Because I know where one is right now.

519
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Yeah. This tower of return takes

520
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,440
you... I forget where this takes you.

521
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Where did you even go?

522
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,470
We are really desynced.

523
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,500
Just kind of wandering. I'm in like

524
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
a constant state right now of thinking I know where

525
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
I am and then going somewhere and going, no, this isn't

526
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
it. Okay, so

527
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
you teleport to

528
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,740
the northern

529
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
lake, northern

530
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,740
lake shore, all the way up

531
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,740
where the runes are, the king's

532
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
realm runes. There is a boss

533
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,519
right there. Where?

534
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,519
We need to figure out, like people are saying

535
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,519
there's a hotkey to accept a vote.

536
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,589
No, do road to the manor first.

537
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:03,750
Let me upgrade this fucking sword, please.

538
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,750
Where the blacksmith is. And then right

539
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,500
below that is a boss we can fight. LB

540
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
in the map, apparently. You have to be

541
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,339
in the map. Oh, and

542
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,339
then, yeah, then it centers on

543
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:18,339
whatever you voted for. Really?

544
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:25,769
That's cool. I'm kind of the master of trying to

545
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,769
teleport somewhere and just placing markers

546
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:32,759
on it. The markers are so helpful.

547
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,930
We need to keep doing it.

548
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,930
Alright. Do you have any smithing stones?

549
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,930
Six?

550
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,930
I probably do, but I'm likely about

551
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,680
to use them. No, I don't.

552
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
So, this is the idea.

553
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,529
Here we go. The idea

554
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:56,730
is this. Why is he acting like I never talk to him?

555
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,180
Okay, see this banished knight's

556
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,680
greatsword? I'm thinking

557
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
of just

558
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,980
upgrading the hell out of this right now.

559
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,500
Just upgrading this. And infusing it.

560
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,059
Right? Either this or the battleaxe.

561
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:15,059
And I don't know which one

562
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,059
is better, because I don't know

563
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:19,240
min-max bullshit. Battleaxe

564
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
or banished knight greatsword?

565
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Which one of these is, like, better

566
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,769
to use? I think the greatsword

567
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:36,279
probably better. Sword, big sword,

568
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,279
sword, sword, sword, sword. Axe is cooler.

569
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,279
Sword, sword, sword, sword. Axe is cooler.

570
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,279
Axe, trust me.

571
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,940
Sword, sword, sword, sword.

572
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
I need more smithing. I can't believe

573
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
not every person in your chat didn't say the same

574
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,819
thing. I need how many more

575
00:32:55,819 --> 00:33:00,549
smithing stone ones do I need? You need three

576
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,180
smithing stone ones to get out of,

577
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,180
I think. I think three. Yeah.

578
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
I need two more smithing

579
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
stone ones. You can buy them at the shop

580
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,609
at the place.

581
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,980
Okay. Can I

582
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
just go there? Can I just get this out of the way?

583
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,980
I promise I won't be doing this again.

584
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:29,400
He grinded off stream.

585
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,259
I didn't grind off stream.

586
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,940
I just prepared off stream.

587
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
I didn't get exposed. I literally killed the same

588
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
enemy ten times and then bought like a dozen

589
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,710
stones at the vendor. Did you accept

590
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:56,359
it? I thought I did.

591
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,359
Here. I was just gonna fucking banish

592
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:01,430
you. I have the cheap

593
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,430
upgrade thing and I think you don't was part of

594
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:07,079
the situation as well. What do you mean?

595
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,079
You have to actually spend like

596
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,079
three, six smithing stones.

597
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:13,820
Yes, I do. I don't. So that

598
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
was the whole problem yesterday. The whole problem was

599
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,820
you have the cheat code and I don't.

600
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,900
Who's this?

601
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,519
Oh, it's okay. This is

602
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:30,860
very, very odd. I thought it

603
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,170
was a chicken. Okay, how many

604
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:48,460
of these things do I need?

605
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,590
Oh, I'm back already. Lay out your arms then.

606
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:57,900
Tarnished. Where are you going?

607
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
You've played this game fucking thousands of times.

608
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,199
How have you not figured out where the blacksmith

609
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,340
is permanently in your brain? You fucking

610
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,739
idiot. I just don't know how it's possible.

611
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,739
It's by the fire. To the left of the fire. Don't

612
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:21,210
forget that ever again. Okay, we're good.

613
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,690
Boom, boom, go.

614
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,920
Go, go. All right.

615
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,289
I got a plus eight.

616
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,289
I got a plus eight greatsword.

617
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,530
I need one more smithing

618
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,530
stone three. Do you have one of those?

619
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:41,059
Smithing stone three. And just a regular smithing stone three?

620
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:43,739
I do. Excellent.

621
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:45,739
If I please have it I will trade you for something that I have.

622
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:50,989
What do you need? I needed like a spell.

623
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:54,690
You want me to list out the spells I have?

624
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,690
Do you actually have spells? Do you have any

625
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,690
like...crystal greatswords

626
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,690
or anything? I have...

627
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,239
This one's really important. You need this one there. There's your and I also have

628
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,570
Gelmer's fury you need style. That's not I want arcane pick that up off the ground

629
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:20,030
It does not belong on the ground. I mean you picked it up starlight. Did you pick this one up?

630
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,420
No that I dropped the stone for you. Oh

631
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:36,409
Tonish what the fuck is wrong with you Mike? Here we go

632
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:44,500
I have a plus ten great sword now and it's good and it's it's just a regular sword and I can infuse it

633
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,059
What stone do you need after that?

634
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:59,389
Hold on. Let me do this first. This is probably this one right heavy will six one sixty seven that okay

635
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:04,409
I I have smithing stone fours you can use to get to 12. Where is this better?

636
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,489
No, no, I am I'm I put fire on it

637
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:20,179
I need you shouldn't put fire on it because then I think it's faith scaling. Okay

638
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:27,699
What do I need fours are there any smithing stone fours flame of red main is insane

639
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:39,860
I need do I I need one smithing stone four and then I will just have to go

640
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:49,460
Do you have any smithing stone fours? Yeah, I have two also one down take this as well because I have a

641
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:59,219
Couple of scrolls like spell scrolls that you should probably be using royal house scroll. I can't leave it. Nevermind

642
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:14,110
I put it down in the main room. Thank you so much. Okay now

643
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:18,320
Everything is gonna be good to go. I have a plus 11

644
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,260
This thing's doing like this thing's doing like three four hundred damage. This thing's good to go

645
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:32,920
All right, the crack blade is shit on bosses. I'm just I just wanted to scaling use fire use fire. Everyone's

646
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,449
Telling you you're wrong. Yeah, I am right

647
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:43,579
There is one fire that I believe is faith and there's one that's actually strength. I am wrong and I apologize

648
00:38:44,139 --> 00:39:00,900
That's like less damage though. That's all right. Wait, what wait what just happened? This better? It's oh, it's split damage

649
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,389
Craig please

650
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:19,849
Okay, here's what's gonna happen. Why am I so confused by this? This is 232

651
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,630
232 14 135 versus

652
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,389
214 no, it's whatever. It's the fucking same. It's OP fire. I'm just gonna keep this

653
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:42,320
This is what I'm using for now. We'll figure it out later fire infusion, please great sword swings. You're picking the same infusion

654
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,840
What? All right. I gotta stop looking at chat cuz like I look over here and I go wait

655
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:54,659
Why don't I look over here? No, all right. Here's what I'm doing. I'm almost my brain is split between two spots

656
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:06,409
Here's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. That's what I'm doing. I

657
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:20,639
Can't just like flip-flop for like the next hour. Okay, I'm ready from here

658
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,829
Where do you want to go flame of red me and got nerfed so hard. It's shit now chat

659
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:33,059
I don't know. I I'm just gonna go with the crack do something that you like. That's what I'm gonna do

660
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:36,829
So let's now you run it when I go fight the boss to go back to the Smith

661
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:49,389
I'm gonna go down that actually lightens up the load a little bit. I could put on some better armor. All right, we're good

662
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:58,199
Just a short 45 minute stalls not a big deal. I thought stall its progression. That's true

663
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:09,880
We're not gonna do a raid as a guild until your gear score goes up. Tell chat stop being backseat Andes

664
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,460
No, I mean, here's the problem

665
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,860
I keep asking different questions and reading so I ask five questions and then I get an answer to the second question

666
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:24,139
And I think it's an answer to the first question while people are spamming an answer for the fourth question

667
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:26,440
So I'm like so confused

668
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,599
It's my own answers to questions that are

669
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,179
That like also played the game a while ago and they've actually patched and balanced a lot of stuff and like I don't even know

670
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:41,590
What is real anymore? It's my it's my it's my fault though. It's not their fault. All right

671
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:51,269
So you're ready ready to fight the boss? There is a catacombs like right here. Yeah, it's a it's literally I haven't marked

672
00:41:51,269 --> 00:41:55,110
I did have it marked and it's marked

673
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,059
Um

674
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:11,949
Where is it writer? It's right here somewhere. Where is it? This place is a bit of a mess. I haven't marked like right here

675
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:18,019
I'm doing so much more damage. I'm doing like 300 damage a swing now. It's so worth it

676
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:26,000
This crab coming over here. I got

677
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,590
Wrecked are you alive?

678
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,860
Yeah, uh

679
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,699
It's over. It's not over there. It's over here. It's near my marker

680
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,679
The hell is my mother I

681
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:51,639
Remember every playthrough I've ever done. I've wandered around this place forgetting where this hole is. It's right here

682
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,639
I it's my markers right here

683
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,280
It's right here somewhere

684
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:06,519
Goddamnit. What where where is it? Oh shit. Hey, you want to go back to round it?

685
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,440
It's the floor. Oh, it's a little it's an illusion floor. It's illusion floor. I was saying like what the hell

686
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:16,239
Like some trick to this one. Oh

687
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,940
shit

688
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:35,559
What the hell is this is an interesting swing? This is kind of a bunny. This is like a goofy swing

689
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:45,599
What?

690
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,869
Where are you? I make a giant rock candy stick. I'm not getting rid of this

691
00:43:50,869 --> 00:44:00,190
Why did you guys want me to do anything else down here? This thing does 400 damage now. You gotta be shitting me

692
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,190
I can't believe people were telling me to do the fire

693
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:11,030
When you say down here, okay, so let me come find you. I think guys there there we are

694
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:17,400
Okay, and for reference I have a plus 20 long sword now and then when you ask me in two hours and you're like

695
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,000
Surprised that I have it. I just want you to know now you have a plus 20. Did you grind off stream? No

696
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:34,179
Did you see my like super cool rock candy sword? I did not this is so cool. Wow. I actually love this

697
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:40,920
I didn't even know this is in the game. Huh? Yeah, that's so cool. It looks like a

698
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,719
Like a kebab gone wrong

699
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:49,719
Yeah, it looks like it looks like a like a kebab you left on the grill for like six hours. All right, let's do it

700
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:56,579
Okay. Well, this is a problem

701
00:44:56,659 --> 00:45:13,800
Wait, don't maybe don't aggro that don't aggro the the crystal night. I think he's gonna get spawned in. Yep

702
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,920
He is that's when he gets activated

703
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:23,550
All right. It is imperative that we thought this room is so small

704
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,309
We have to just like co-op the fuck out of one of them early. I

705
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:30,860
Thought the one with less health

706
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,659
Well, I mean like when we first get in here like we just nice holy shit. Oh

707
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:45,650
Come on. There's no way. There's no way. There's no way. I

708
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:53,059
Can't believe that why did it not hit him? How did that not hit him?

709
00:45:53,500 --> 00:46:00,650
It's all right. Now you have a you have a 1v1 now with your plus 20 sword. You can do it

710
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:03,809
It's just it's a regular crystal night. The worst part about this is doing them both the same time

711
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:07,050
I'm used to doing it with a shield that can parry this one can't

712
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:23,980
My damage is too low against him. I like need to parry him. Remember the timings

713
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,090
This shield cannot parry. Oh, you actually can't parry

714
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,139
I'm out of healing

715
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:47,130
Well, it looks like you're just gonna have to do it. Sorry. I don't know I the hitbox he apparently I don't know

716
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,150
I swung the sword at him and it just didn't I just didn't hurt him

717
00:46:50,889 --> 00:47:04,110
America. Yeah, we can do it. Don't switch my shield. We just need to

718
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,230
Go absolutely hard on the first boss

719
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:12,500
Missed be gone. I love that word

720
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:26,130
Missed be gone. I love how you read dead just left your horse like well the horses keep desyncing

721
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:50,699
So I just got off of it. I don't know. I'm down here. Hold on. Don't go in. All right, let's go

722
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:59,900
That's rolled right into that

723
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:17,019
I'm gonna distract this one over here. I still don't know the timings on these guys at all

724
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,019
It's been so long since I've seen them

725
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:22,250
I'd rather fight the crystal night

726
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:36,349
The crystal night has so much health. He's distracted. I died. He distracted him right into me

727
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,309
He's just not he kind of just decided he was gonna go after you

728
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:26,110
Crucible night is being I know he really is he's letting us duel. Oh, this is over now. No, no, no

729
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:31,010
Jesus that's fucking fast

730
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:38,210
The misbegotten warrior is so annoying because he does that jump in the air where he he has to jump in the air swing

731
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:46,380
One of them is insanely fast and one is incredibly slow. Let me uh, I will try and take aggro from the crucible night

732
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:52,380
Once he spawns that's one of the bosses like the early one that you fight in the the jail

733
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:58,119
That might be one of the longest times I spent fighting a boss in dark and Elden Ring to be fair

734
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,360
That's like I'm used to shit. I consider this fight to be one of the worst fights in the whole game

735
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:15,619
What do you mean this this randomized fight? What do you mean this fight this boss fight? Did you not do this either that it's randomized

736
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:20,019
What do you mean? Did he not do this in the main game? Oh my god, dude

737
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:28,349
Hold on. Did you have you never seen these two in the same room together? No, dude. You got to play Elden Ring

738
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,110
You got a play that you got to play Elden Ring man

739
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:41,739
You've never seen these two people in the same boss fight. I don't think so

740
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,369
Okay, so

741
00:50:44,369 --> 00:50:50,059
In radan's area when you go to fight radan, uh-huh. You did not

742
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,139
Fight these two you did you know, did you ever go back to radan's castle?

743
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:04,329
Yeah, you know, this is a boss fight in the game is the crucible night and misbegotten warrior. Okay, I guess I missed it

744
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:13,420
Holy shit. Sorry. Oh my god. I'm like jealous of you. I'm actually like incredibly jealous of you

745
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:24,289
You've got like a lot of game. Well, I've got like full aggro. Let's start hitting them. This fight sucks

746
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:48,659
Unbelievable unbelievable start unbelievable start he's almost dead

747
00:51:48,900 --> 00:52:02,710
Careful. He's coming this way. I'm fucking this up so bad

748
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:07,250
If I could just land one fucking hit on this guy

749
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:23,289
Okay, he's dead. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. He does have a shitload of health

750
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:48,989
Oh my god, it's the armor. We need like a blunt weapon. I think this is technically blunt. There he goes with this bullshit

751
00:52:49,550 --> 00:53:17,360
Good good. Good. Good. Good. Uh-oh. Oh

752
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,219
Oh

753
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:24,170
It's okay, but I got I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah, you got it

754
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,780
it's

755
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,539
You can't win the first part of the day

756
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:40,010
We're good. We're good. I I thought I was going crazy because

757
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:46,889
When we were talking about how this was not in the real dance castle, we're Dan. You got me saying it. I'm sorry

758
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:52,960
Yeah, so the when you first said that you were like, what are you talking about? This is randomized

759
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,929
I thought you were fucking with me. No, I

760
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:04,469
Don't castle had like all the chimeras and stuff the Kimmer Kimmer is so I was like nah

761
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:11,619
I didn't explore it too much. Actually, I don't blame you cuz that area is is probably one of the shittiest areas in the whole game

762
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:14,019
I didn't even know there was a catacomb in there

763
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:20,570
I I do not blame you for skipping that part of the like of the optional kind of stuff

764
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,730
Well, I'm dead and I got to get my souls on that item

765
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:33,449
But I do you want me to fire me you have a bonfire go to the castle before the festival

766
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:39,800
I thought once you get to the castle the festival has already started. I think if you it I think if you beat

767
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,190
Dan if you kill for Dan and then you go, maybe you skip it, right?

768
00:54:46,719 --> 00:55:03,179
Where's the bonfire from here? No, I think a lot of people don't bother going back after the tourney

769
00:55:03,179 --> 00:55:09,980
It's possible this fight only happens if you go to red main early. It doesn't happen after the tourney even afterwards

770
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:17,420
There's one of the teleporters that just takes you straight to the festival and then it was like, okay festival

771
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:22,139
Then I did for dawn and then look the whole castle looked like shit. Oh, yes

772
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:29,219
I already I already did the boss. So like why would I go back to the castle? It can happen after I guess it does happen after

773
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:44,119
The hardest to find I lost again. I hope you don't I think I know leave me alone. Leave me alone

774
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:52,369
Sorry, I got so upset with you. We're not knowing where the secret boss was

775
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:55,130
That's impossible to find something that I did that you didn't do

776
00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:02,079
I'm going to and say probably not and I'm the only I'm gonna give you one reason why that is it's not because of

777
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,880
Playing it but it's because of watching every single fatty video on this game

778
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:23,269
So I I don't think there's anything that I haven't seen not for my own doing I got what did you get in there?

779
00:56:23,429 --> 00:56:27,559
Like a spear. Oh cool. I got a glass shard

780
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,800
I'm taking up a lot of glass my hand is raw

781
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:38,829
See, I just thought I thought you were messing with me. I was trying to mess with you back, but then no I was the wrong one

782
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:44,389
I remember we were talking before the stream started about how I'm actually a from soft from soft fraud. I

783
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:51,050
Don't think that's true

784
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:59,320
In Sekiro, you know the big giant fire beast. Yeah. Did you do that? Yeah, I did. I did not do that

785
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:10,570
There's a lot of things that I've noped out of but you know, I'm a bit of a fraud isn't that smart though

786
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:17,800
You're just kind of smart because if you go to like an optional area and you just like this is dumb

787
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,760
I'm not fucking doing this. You're kind of like like really shitty from sauce bosses

788
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:28,309
I actually that that fire boss and secures is way up there for me

789
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:31,869
Yeah doing the the hate with the hatred at hatred boss, right?

790
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:38,159
Doing that boss and after like the 20th attempt just going like, you know what I could like go mow the lawn right now

791
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,159
I don't need to do this

792
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,719
I don't think that's a bad thing

793
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:59,150
So let me clear that okay

794
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:04,550
I think we have an opportunity to attempt the boss again last to do 66

795
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:10,030
But I feel like if we do that this early we might get trapped there and it might be like a disaster

796
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,840
So let's um, you know how you you can go up the whole right side or left side of the lake. Mm-hmm

797
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,119
Like let's just go like we haven't done any of that

798
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,639
There's like a whole urn tree and there's catacombs and there's a whole bunch of stuff on both sides

799
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:32,860
Yeah, let's let's take it slow. Well, you want to you left or right side? Um, let's go on the left side

800
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:38,510
I feel like there's more things over there. I remember let's start at the

801
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:45,610
The ruins way at the bottom and just like hugged the left and then you go up into like the albaneric village and all that

802
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:53,869
Oh, you want to go you want to go all the way down down? Okay. Yeah and on the map remember press left bumper

803
00:58:53,869 --> 00:59:11,010
It'll take you straight to it. Yeah that we hold that left side is um, you're saying I think no map

804
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:20,980
We have to get a map. What is this title randomizer with stir emotional Halloween special?

805
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:29,860
That's actually pretty good. That's that's good. It's way better than I did. I am getting a bit emotional

806
00:59:31,389 --> 00:59:34,139
full emotional playthrough

807
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:49,500
Emotional Halloween special I should be in like an orange shirt to be really fair though that whole Ronnie quest line

808
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,480
I don't think is I at least in my opinion

809
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:58,329
I don't know how you would do any of that like there's so much of that that's kind of I was like

810
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:04,250
Why would I do this? I actually did do it you did. I mean I got a lot of hell cave right here

811
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:08,980
I I mean I had to read like, you know, there's no way you do it like intuitively

812
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:10,860
It's a total mess

813
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,699
That's what I mean like doing that without any guidance is like I don't even know why you would even do some of that stuff

814
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,420
Why are you even attack?

815
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:22,139
How do people even how do you I feel like a lot of people kind of stumble upon it like the first people that do

816
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:24,260
That mission they stumble upon it and they go

817
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:29,949
What the fuck just happened and then they go oh my god and they and they write it down because obviously the first person

818
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,449
It took me to a whole bunch of places

819
01:00:31,449 --> 01:00:38,369
I didn't even know existed like the whole ant like ants as an enemy type was like one of the last things I found in

820
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:41,449
The whole game was like, I don't know how I missed like an entire like ant cave

821
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:47,369
I think that's part of the reason why people like these games so much though is because

822
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:54,159
It's just stuff that you're never going to do and that's cool. Yeah

823
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:03,110
Thank God we bought let me cast my magics wrong one. Wait, don't do it yet. I know what you're about to do

824
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:07,739
Don't do it yet. Where are you? I cast starlight. No

825
01:01:08,659 --> 01:01:22,119
Okay, you got a little bit of a lightning situation up there we do

826
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,440
Let's keep we don't gotta go up there screw them

827
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:42,929
Thank God you have that spell are we both long sword Andy's we are are we?

828
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:52,139
Copies me you copies me. I did cuz I I took what you said to heart

829
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:59,480
What did I say? I'm just like it's just works and it's good and it's not like oh I have to do this

830
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:17,320
I have to do this just pick the thing that works and it's good. I thought there was a turn in here

831
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,840
I did too. Oh, you gotta go into the waterfall. Oh

832
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:29,760
Who what am I talking about here?

833
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:38,309
What the hell are you doing? I mean I gotta get something from the nominees here. We haven't done it once

834
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:46,230
I'm just gonna do this now so that in a year from now people can tell me this was the worst sound

835
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:58,650
I'm gonna make sure that category to get filled out at the end of the year. Um, I think we go down

836
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:04,050
Down. Oh, yeah, I got it. I got a epic. I got an epic loot up here

837
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:25,820
What? Oh, yeah, you do go down of rune arc nice

838
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:37,800
There's usually something scary down here. Isn't there at the end of this cave?

839
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,400
I believe it would normally be one of the berserker guys. I

840
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,679
It sounds like a dragon. It's something very loud something big

841
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:59,179
Has very heavy footsteps. Yo, watch my back

842
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:07,929
These guys don't get wash my back bro. I can't do that when the thing explodes

843
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:22,059
Secrets over here. Oh, hey. Hey, I gotta cast my spell wait. Okay. It's getting a little it's a little dark in here

844
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:24,300
I mean, thank you. Maybe it's like a starlight kid

845
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:31,059
There it is. Thank you. I'm only gonna do that once. I don't I don't even know what that was. They're all staff

846
01:04:31,059 --> 01:04:38,719
I'm only gonna do that once every ten minutes. Okay, I've gotten like four stabs at this point and one spell

847
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:49,679
I even upgraded the ones. Oh god. That's a lot of guys. Why why they don't why they don't they don't care

848
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,650
Over here. I'm gonna take their item. No, you angered them. Oh

849
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:03,219
No, you have angered them. All right. Well fuck him up

850
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:12,480
Why is this one's huge? Oh, you've never seen the huge albinoeric

851
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,639
Yeah

852
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:20,670
Have you seen the huge albinoeric? Yeah, nice

853
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:25,059
See, I got something good here

854
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,119
Oh man, I think that's actually fucking a thousand times better than what I have

855
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,929
God every item you pick up is a thousand times better than what you have

856
01:05:34,929 --> 01:05:35,730
Let's go upgrade it

857
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:41,329
But I really I really mean it this time like I think this actually is the like unbelievable

858
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,119
It's faith weapon. Whatever. I'm sticking with what I have. What is it?

859
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,920
God slayer great sword

860
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:52,619
Oh

861
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,159
Oh god

862
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,159
God's flame. Oh flame

863
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:14,610
Another staff, I'll be careful when we go through the darkness if something's gonna appear

864
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,219
Ooh

865
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:22,659
Oh a jar

866
01:06:22,659 --> 01:06:29,170
Oh, that's another good one. I can't believe elden beast was down here

867
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:37,380
Don't say that

868
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,380
Uh, is it time to put pants on?

869
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:46,940
Yes, it is

870
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,500
Uh-oh look out. It's a snail

871
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:56,159
This is the gimmick fight. It is the gimmick fight

872
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:00,769
Just to go where it's kind of lit up

873
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:05,969
This is like at all like a glow i'm just distracting the guy

874
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:11,570
You you handle the snail and he's just staying in the same spot. He's kind of dumb

875
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,059
elden beast

876
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:25,139
Cookbook

877
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:27,139
Got a flower. This is a question for chat

878
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:32,690
These two weapons are effectively the exact same weapon, but there's weird

879
01:07:33,409 --> 01:07:36,849
This one scales differently. Do I have the right call?

880
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,239
Is the bandage still better than this?

881
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,639
You could do fire on the other one and do weld them

882
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:54,750
I'm gonna get this to plus 20 at least right we have to

883
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,630
At least I got ice frying hatchet

884
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,659
I think that is one of the things that actually did get nerfed a lot

885
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,619
That's the speedrun kind of broken speedrun item, right?

886
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:08,539
The earliest I think that was one of like the first nerfs

887
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:35,140
That was an epic dungeon there my friend

888
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:37,539
No, that was good. We got some good stuff

889
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,220
The medallion that's a good question. The medallions might be a problem

890
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,619
We can get there one of them. Oh, you do already have one of them. I have the like left halig tree medallion. Okay

891
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,369
Uh, I think I think you just have to teleport out of this one

892
01:08:56,529 --> 01:09:04,380
Yeah, I think we we need to go get the map. Can we go to like the south ray lucaria gate and just go just get the map

893
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,479
uh, okay, because

894
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,470
Yeah, this is

895
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:23,039
Irritating me

896
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:25,039
Did you vote?

897
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,159
Wait

898
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:27,380
um

899
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,500
Change that go to the the laski arm ruins

900
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,989
You hate my teeth

901
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:46,189
They're mine. You don't have to worry about it

902
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:06,180
In the middle of that somebody goes hey dude, thanks for clearing up my mucus. I like appreciate it

903
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:14,699
Did you no, it's just I just look I look over here sometimes and somebody just writes a random sentence

904
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:26,819
Like I feel like that person was actually talking to a doctor and they like talked in the wrong channel. He's a bot

905
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:33,819
Although why would you text that to your doctor? Oh, hey, dude. Hey, thanks for clearing up my mucus really appreciate it

906
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:39,439
it's like why I

907
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,920
I mean if your doctor helped you with your mucus, I'm sure he'd like to hear that he helped

908
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,819
But if I went, I don't know if I every time i've gone to the doctor

909
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:55,340
It's not like oh, hey, yeah, i'm gonna text you and let you know like when I wouldn't like my uh throat throat gets better

910
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:58,270
I don't know where you're going. I got the map

911
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:00,109
Oh

912
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:02,670
I'm just trying to get all you want it. I'm just trying to get away from all the

913
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,390
You made me turn around and now i'm getting attacked

914
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:15,550
Uh

915
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,550
Now we can go wherever you want

916
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:23,550
Uh come mortar. Can you see where I am? Yes, I can

917
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:26,109
Yeah, there's like a jumpy over here

918
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:29,260
And there should be a jail up here

919
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,729
Ooh, let's do it

920
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:45,250
I think is how it's pronounced. I got 10k souls on me. I should probably like

921
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:48,449
Use that at some point. I do too

922
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,119
But let's just hope there's not something horrible in here

923
01:11:58,739 --> 01:12:00,739
I don't think this is that bad

924
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:24,319
oh my god

925
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,319
I thought you were gonna swing again, but

926
01:12:41,579 --> 01:12:44,210
Well, I don't know what this is

927
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:47,409
Uh, I think it just means I go a little bit faster and i'm a little bit stronger

928
01:12:47,569 --> 01:12:49,569
No, I mean the boss what the boss is doing

929
01:12:53,659 --> 01:12:56,859
No, I think that's what it was like my weapon has a coating on it now

930
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,529
Ooh, do you get anything good?

931
01:13:08,529 --> 01:13:10,529
Not really. I already had that smithing stone sevens

932
01:13:12,619 --> 01:13:33,310
Our somber seven

933
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:37,149
It was better than what I had on

934
01:13:37,149 --> 01:13:55,979
Kind of they're watching us. They are okay

935
01:13:56,909 --> 01:13:57,949
uh

936
01:13:57,949 --> 01:14:05,779
Very very nice. I don't know. Why is this marked this lake shore chat? Why did I mark this?

937
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:10,300
You've been marking things whenever they're complete. I felt like

938
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:16,619
I've been doing complete as a sword. This is means like is it a merchant? Oh the crab merchant is here. Okay

939
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,260
But I I don't I can take this off because I took the um

940
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,630
uh the ball bearing

941
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:31,779
All right, let's go up that let's just hug this left side like you want to do

942
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:37,260
Yeah

943
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,220
No, you're gonna have to get over it. I'm not i'm not saying it chat wants me to do something

944
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:42,619
And i'm just gonna have to you're just gonna have to get over it. This is not happening

945
01:14:44,670 --> 01:14:52,739
You're just gonna have to get over it. Oh god, you got lobstered

946
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:04,500
Oh god

947
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,380
You're going like a really strange way through this forest

948
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:15,140
I saw like a a lot of enemies. I didn't want to do anything to is that another? Okay. What's with the dragons?

949
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,520
What's with all these dragons? They keep the same thing

950
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,399
When I was watching a fucking game of thrones

951
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,479
That sounds like somebody that's never heard of the series before

952
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,279
I sat down in the middle

953
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,579
the middle of an episode

954
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,760
Uh, oh

955
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,460
Let's just hold left

956
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:47,060
believe there's

957
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:55,539
Cave or something here

958
01:15:55,539 --> 01:15:58,899
No, i'm wrong

959
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:03,140
Oh, I feel like there might be something. I think we go down

960
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:07,300
I want to you know that place where you fight like the giant and like the whole horde of people

961
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,689
I like that spot. Hmm

962
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,579
That was always my like weapon test zone because you respawn right next to like the battle

963
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,699
Armazula is gonna be really easy. It actually really might be we might be able to walk through it

964
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:25,550
It's all the random enemies

965
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:35,039
It's not gonna be as horrible

966
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:36,960
Okay, so we need to go

967
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,199
You want to go like up?

968
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,239
I could use that rotten crystal sword

969
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:49,470
The mob that you were talking about is on the east side of lyrania

970
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:02,220
Wait, wait, i'm in obany rock

971
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,100
Please take this medallion

972
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,079
You must use it. I love that's my favorite character

973
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:17,710
Wait, wait, please

974
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:20,430
What the hell is happening? I gotta get off the horse

975
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:24,420
It's a fucking bra dude. I mean it

976
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:31,739
There's so many people up here. We gotta kill that caster, man

977
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,220
i'm getting

978
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,659

979
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:37,659
I my game doesn't know what's the target

980
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,340
Oh my god, i'm so overwhelmed

981
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:44,029

982
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:46,720
Okay caster is

01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:58,510

01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:00,750
Bat motherfucker get away from me

987
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:19,460
Okay, it's clapper. It's clapper clapper. I'm gonna spend my souls

988
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,899
My runes that's probably a good idea

989
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:29,470
Where's the boss fight? It's up a little more right?

990
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:41,869
Across the bridge and down

991
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:43,869
Uh, you talk to you get the guy up here

992
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:47,630
I can't remember why you need them. Yeah, i'm just trying to I just want to level up

993
01:18:48,350 --> 01:19:01,340
I need way more endurance than this

994
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:23,069
he's in the

995
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:25,380
can right

996
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:37,409
He's in the can

997
01:19:49,729 --> 01:19:54,590
Don't interrupt

998
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:13,729
I beg you

999
01:20:13,729 --> 01:20:18,000
Would you look after this medallion? That's a nice medallion

1000
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:22,479
All right, that's cool. I got a memory stone and a sacred tear

1001
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:25,840
Oh, no, this old man's mind is fucking gone

1002
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,989
Take this medallion, please

1003
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:34,909
Like like a turd in his hand like oh, this is not what that is man

1004
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,180
That's my first flask upgrade

1005
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,840
I'm so glad you actually got one of those because if you didn't you actually might

1006
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,479
It might be like a dead run

1007
01:20:53,579 --> 01:21:00,220
Needing to drink like six times eventually you might physically not be able to take more than like three hits. Yes pretty bad

1008
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,420
It's been pretty bad

1009
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:06,539
But I make do

1010
01:21:06,539 --> 01:21:08,140
Item in the coffin

1011
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,260
Oh, I didn't pick it up. I was too busy watching my favorite movie

1012
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:27,539
Trolls roar. I feel like that's I don't think i've seen that

1013
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:38,050
It's fun, but bad

1014
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:42,130
You know, I feel like that's the case with all from software games everything is fun

1015
01:21:42,289 --> 01:21:46,449
But bad except for two things and they're the best thing and don't ever use anything else

1016
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,720
I just wish they made everything bad

1017
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Then you need to stop reading reddit

1018
01:22:05,729 --> 01:22:11,920
True. Hey one person said true one person said true. Yeah, because you didn't come up with that opinion yourself

1019
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,939
What I can't just agree with some things I can't I have to does every single opinion have to be

1020
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:26,260
A completely original opinion on something. You can't just agree with something

1021
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,829
I mean

1022
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:32,909
If you don't have what are you baiting me to jump off the cliff for?

1023
01:22:36,029 --> 01:22:41,069
I'm just saying like it's you probably wouldn't have that opinion if everyone on reddit didn't have the opinion that x thing

1024
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:45,069
Is the good thing people don't try all of the things and then they repeat the one thing that's good

1025
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:49,869
And then once that thing gets nerfed then someone goes wait a second this one other thing that thing is also good

1026
01:22:49,949 --> 01:22:51,310
Let's all do that

1027
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:53,310
Yeah, and then that's the new thing

1028
01:22:54,029 --> 01:22:55,869
Okay, but it was always good

1029
01:22:55,869 --> 01:23:02,430
I would agree with you, but could you please use any of the crystal sorceries in the entire game?

1030
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:09,329
None of them are good. You know could you know, I mean like which like which ones they're they're good, right?

1031
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,319
There there's like

1032
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:17,729
I I don't fit one which which ones are the crystal ones the ones that go like

1033
01:23:18,529 --> 01:23:24,500
The like machine gun ones. No, they're the purple crystal thing. It's it's okay

1034
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:32,909
Glintstone is light blue crystal is purple ones purple. The purple shit sucks. All right

1035
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:36,670
Well, i'm gonna okay. Let me fucking put on a different spell even glintstone

1036
01:23:37,149 --> 01:23:40,510
There's like a hundred glintstone moves and honestly

1037
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:46,210
There's maybe three or four of them that are like good like good enough to like carry you through a playthrough

1038
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,439
Good enough to carry you so you're not good. You need something good enough to carry you

1039
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:59,329
I saw all capitals wrong and then all capitals true right next to each other. That's the worst take

1040
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,810
I'm i'm gonna disagree with you

1041
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:02,130
dude

1042
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:07,170
I used rain of stars and I was so excited about it and everyone omega lulled at me because they thought they would like dude

1043
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:09,729
You're an idiot that thing sucks and it was like one of the most expensive

1044
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:18,720
Crystal spells in the whole game every time I got a crystal move. I looked over and just saw

1045
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,880
Oh my god omega lull that thing sucks, dude. Oh my god

1046
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,140
It's that's one of the worst spells in the game and I was like, okay

1047
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:29,340
And I used it and it did like 40 damage and I was like, okay, that's suck

1048
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,829
So I never used it ever again

1049
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:37,100
I'm not doing a paul bearer impression was I?

1050
01:24:37,899 --> 01:24:40,270
Well, I think that's a very different take

1051
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:46,350
Some things are bad instead of there's one or two good things and only use those or you're bad

1052
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:48,989
I know you're very different than

1053
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:52,529
Like this one spell isn't good

1054
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,250
Well, hold on. There's there's a difference between

1055
01:24:55,649 --> 01:24:57,970
Like everything is bad. So only use the good thing

1056
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:03,329
Otherwise, like I everyone would have just used rivers of blood only but I mean people kind of did that for a little while

1057
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:05,170
but

1058
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:08,289
Well, yeah, because people told him it was the only good thing for a while

1059
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:10,449
That's all i'm saying is that it's it's uh

1060
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:16,470
But if you went against rivers of blood if you were talking about like a pvp scenario you were automatically at a disadvantage

1061
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,800
Got him

1062
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,520
He's speechless. I mean, I don't know enough about the pvp and I don't think you did any pvp. So

1063
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:33,739
I did a ton of pvp. Did you I did? Yeah

1064
01:25:34,539 --> 01:25:37,020
Sounds like you lost to a lot of people using rivers of blood

1065
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,859
Oh, it'd be so easy if I just used that but like I don't want to because that's cheesy

1066
01:25:40,939 --> 01:25:43,340
So like i'm not gonna use it. I have no experience with how it actually is

1067
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:47,899
But like if if you use that it's like so fucking lame. I lost to another rivers of blood user

1068
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:52,539
I won't do it though. I never said that. Okay, you don't have to kind of writings on the wall

1069
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,460
Oh, there's no writing on the wall

1070
01:25:55,699 --> 01:26:00,479
All I said is a lot of the stuff in this game is really fun to use

1071
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:05,979
But no, no, don't say stir like winning stir. Like what a base take by stir

1072
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:11,899
No renala's full moon if i'm the reddit guy if i'm the reddit guy, you're the chat guy. You're the chat guy

1073
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:15,340
I'm the chat guy. Yeah, you're the check. If i'm the reddit guy, you're the chat guy

1074
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:19,699
What does that what does that mean look over a chat and you're like, oh, that's what they're saying

1075
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:21,779
All right. All right. I'm not gonna I got it

1076
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:27,630
They're the same guy the reddit guy and the chat guy are the same guy

1077
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:45,939
How why are you so good at this? I fucking hate you. Okay. All right, you ready?

1078
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:53,489
So good at what i'm just like speaking common english. Why are you so good at this? All right, where are we going?

1079
01:26:53,970 --> 01:27:08,960
Oh, we missed a boss. That's right up in the village. It's too bad. That move is not very good

1080
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:15,359
Uh, hold on as I think I also have the moon staff

1081
01:27:16,930 --> 01:27:19,329
I figure which one does like bonus moon damage

1082
01:27:21,420 --> 01:27:24,699
Uh, that move actually is fantastic. I used it for almost the whole playthrough

1083
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:30,420
Is that's the the running moon one, right? Yeah, renala

1084
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:36,590
Excuse me. Yeah, I have carrion regal scepter is the moon sorcery one

1085
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:48,590
But I upgraded my carrion glidstone to 15. So how much um intelligence do you have right now enough?

1086
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,380
It does not take like 70 to use

1087
01:27:54,050 --> 01:28:01,329
True. I shouldn't like another another thing that my randomizer did is it made all the requirements zero on spells really?

1088
01:28:01,890 --> 01:28:06,859
Yeah, dude. Your game is like so my game my game's fucked up, dude

1089
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:09,659
Hold on. It's zero

1090
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,899
Yeah, everything is the zero

1091
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:16,460
I'm not using it dude. You could like at this point

1092
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:21,939
I would change it but it would break everything and we'd have another like two hour delay

1093
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:34,699
Nah, it's not worth it. Let's just have fun. We're having fun. You know, i'm not a fan

1094
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,239
You know if we're gonna like change the topic of like where's hillary's emails right now

1095
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:49,260
I I don't like stat requirements on things. I'm not a fan. I actually like it. Let's go you want to fucking debate

1096
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:55,409
I you know what I love is that we both are really passionate about things that like don't matter. They don't matter

1097
01:28:55,489 --> 01:28:58,689
They don't matter at all. It's zero thinking back to the conversation

1098
01:28:58,689 --> 01:29:02,050
We had when we were playing ember where we just argued about like vampire survivors

1099
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:08,449
For like an hour is like we both are always on the opposite side of the opinion

1100
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:13,090
Like we both always disagree and are very passionate about something that does not matter at all

1101
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,729
Yeah, it's actually really funny

1102
01:29:15,729 --> 01:29:18,210
And then I thought today I was like it's kind of weird though

1103
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:22,210
Because if you ask us like what our favorite games are we're both like diablo 2 of bloodborne

1104
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:26,609
Yeah, so we're like in total agreeance. Well, we're also

1105
01:29:27,170 --> 01:29:37,279
We don't agree on anything dude yin and yang have to exist. I'm sorry what they do the balance of the universe

1106
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:48,140
I just got it right in the head

1107
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:58,420
Here's the thing the things that we don't agree on like you said are so meaningless that neither one of us could truly get upset

1108
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:04,500
By it, but also we're passionate enough to argue about it, but it's fun to talk. Yeah

1109
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:14,100
We just annihilated that boss

1110
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,859
Yep, he was nobody

1111
01:30:15,859 --> 01:30:24,420
Nobody and nothing

1112
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:30,100
Are you suggesting the balance of the universe is being held up by youtube bickering about video games?

1113
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:34,439
I don't know about you guys, but I feel like i'm the protagonist

1114
01:30:35,489 --> 01:30:37,409
And you're just like

1115
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:39,699
npcs in my world

1116
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:42,180
All right. You know what? I you really might be the main character

1117
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:49,510
I I get I get a lot of I feel like a lot of side character energy coming off of me. You know what I mean?

1118
01:30:51,909 --> 01:30:54,229
I don't know. I think it goes back and forth yin and yang

1119
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:57,510
But I feel we're the two main characters and we finally hook up in the end

1120
01:30:57,909 --> 01:31:00,869
But I feel like i'm not just stops watching i'm never a main character

1121
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:04,550
But I feel like I I end up being every single side character like combined

1122
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,750
The the comic relief like joke character

1123
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:13,189
Nah, i'm like smart and i'm like kind of

1124
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,680
Lillian

1125
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,460
All right, I don't want to be a man I don't want to be the main character

1126
01:31:23,539 --> 01:31:28,340
That sounds like a lot of pressure and the main character all of their family friends and loved ones die

1127
01:31:28,739 --> 01:31:30,979
You don't want to be a main character. No, I don't want to be a man

1128
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:36,180
Yeah, you really don't want to be a main character. I just want to be the chill buddy that like doesn't like just kind of like hey

1129
01:31:36,579 --> 01:31:38,500
Happy to see you

1130
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,500
Sorry, your family died

1131
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:45,000
Don't worry, you'll get the yakuza and being the main character is like

1132
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,960
In the middle of a conversation. It's like, oh, yeah, blah blah blah

1133
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:55,140
Every single other person is talking every character is talking and then eventually they all kind of go like this. What do you have to say?

1134
01:31:55,939 --> 01:31:57,600
your

1135
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,840
Main character is like, oh, um

1136
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,579
well

1137
01:32:02,579 --> 01:32:04,630
I think that

1138
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:10,069
We should who did that? Oh over here

1139
01:32:13,619 --> 01:32:15,619
And see that's why

1140
01:32:15,859 --> 01:32:19,220
Full circle. That's why the terraria playthrough makes sense

1141
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,989
I was the protag

1142
01:32:25,989 --> 01:32:32,979
All comes back to that

1143
01:32:32,979 --> 01:32:36,180
Yeah, I want to be I want to be one of the guys that eats dinner at the table

1144
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,420
I don't want to be the one that has to decide on what we're eating

1145
01:32:38,979 --> 01:32:44,550
Because if I have to decide on what we're eating then, you know

1146
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:46,550
There's gonna be three or four people at that table that are like

1147
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:49,109
steak and onions

1148
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:50,630
I wouldn't pick this

1149
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:52,920
Is it but whose decision was this?

1150
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:57,720
And then if you i'm at the table too, and i'm just like, oh, it's it's okay. I'm all right. I'm all right

1151
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:00,439
It's all right. I am. Yeah

1152
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,319
Yeah, I don't I don't want to be I don't have the person that's like hey

1153
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,159
um, so

1154
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:12,789
You were the one that ordered the lasagna for the table. Yeah, I like lasagna. I don't fucking like lasagna

1155
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:17,430
Well, I just figured we would all eat it because it's it's pasta and sauce and it's

1156
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:22,609
It's you don't want to be a cheese. I just don't want to make decisions for anybody

1157
01:33:27,189 --> 01:33:29,989
I don't want to be the main character

1158
01:33:29,989 --> 01:33:32,789
Oh, so like early on in this run when I was like, which direction do you want to go?

1159
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:34,789
Where do you want to go?

1160
01:33:34,789 --> 01:33:38,630
That was upsetting scrambled eggs and pork chops are not good

1161
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:43,039
Like that's the decision I would make

1162
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,199
That sounds pretty good

1163
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:51,600
I like making decisions on things that I very much know a lot about

1164
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:54,760
Does that make sense?

1165
01:33:54,760 --> 01:34:00,600
I'm okay with being the main character in some very very specific places, but that's it. That's it

1166
01:34:02,289 --> 01:34:08,390
Don't ask me where we should eat. Don't ask me about anything else. What do I ask you about?

1167
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:11,140
um

1168
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,439
something like making like videos

1169
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:16,840
well, I don't know like

1170
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,680
I don't know like

1171
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:22,079
Doing like streams like event streams. I know that

1172
01:34:23,619 --> 01:34:25,760
I know that very well

1173
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,750
You got an event talk to me talk to me

1174
01:34:30,869 --> 01:34:33,090
Stepped on that thing

1175
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:36,770
You want to know where we're going to go for food? Don't call me

1176
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:42,369
You want my opinion on any other thing? You want my opinion on literally any other subject?

1177
01:34:42,529 --> 01:34:46,550
Don't talk to me my game might have crashed. Oh, yeah my game crashed

1178
01:34:50,739 --> 01:34:53,079
Only talk to me about my hyper fixation

1179
01:34:53,779 --> 01:34:57,140
You want to talk to me about like cereal mascots?

1180
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:10,180
Did you actually crash I did yeah, are you dead? No, i'm just laughing at what you said

1181
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:17,439
Okay, that was I thought that was the germa classic. I've done something dumb and I don't want him to know laugh

1182
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:24,210
But that blended into the learning i'm relearning the styles

1183
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,239
I'm all fucking around though like all jokes aside

1184
01:35:29,859 --> 01:35:35,359
It's I make decisions on a lot of things. It's just not i'd rather be somebody that contributes

1185
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:42,770
I'm summoning I put the thing down. I respawn in the same spot where I crashed kind of

1186
01:35:56,229 --> 01:36:00,310
But I do have a cup like you said like whatever my things that I really care about

1187
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:02,789
I will take the helm on it. I will

1188
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,260
Drive the clown clown car until it stops working. Yeah

1189
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,880
anyways

1190
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,640
Where do I go to get a couple people to wrestle each other anyways?

1191
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:34,399
The crystal abilities in this game are not good

1192
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:39,590
Full circle is that full circle because you're kind of taking the wheel

1193
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,430
And saying that they're not good, but also like you don't really know

1194
01:36:44,770 --> 01:36:47,250
I'm just i'm, you know, i'm trying to make a joke

1195
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:51,430
It's not funny to me, dude

1196
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:53,510
Maybe i'm not laughing

1197
01:36:56,069 --> 01:36:58,630
Oh, dude, it's a rock a cool rock in here

1198
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:07,779
Honestly, I would have put that rock in this chest some of this like cool shiny rocks

1199
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:14,289
Don't you think that's what would be in a chest so like in front of the goddess like offering statue

1200
01:37:14,609 --> 01:37:23,250
I'm going to give him a rock. I mean you're cursed for the rest of your life. What was in yours?

1201
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:31,720
Smoldering butterfly, is that better? I mean it it could have some form of like religious

1202
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,800
Like but a rock

1203
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:41,250
But a special rock cannot have that was it a special rock or a rock new topic. Let's go

1204
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,510
Uh, do you care about the dragon abilities?

1205
01:37:53,909 --> 01:38:02,399
I wish I did because the I I could get like the dragon communion seal and i've been I already have like a flame breath

1206
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:08,920
But no because I do in faith. I can't drop them anyways. Never mind. Ooh

1207
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:18,279
Yeah, I found like a whole bunch of the fire magic. I kind of

1208
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:21,810
You know don't know where we're going

1209
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:25,329
Collecting items some of these cats. No, there should be like a boss down here. Yeah

1210
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:28,130
I think we we opened the door. It's down here somewhere

1211
01:38:32,609 --> 01:38:34,050
Try finger

1212
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:37,890
But uh, what about what's it done?

1213
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:47,939
Was there nothing else in here?

1214
01:38:47,939 --> 01:38:58,760
Unless there's another illusory wall

1215
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:09,640
I don't think there is here

1216
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,640
Look, I'm a lantern

1217
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,800
Oh, yeah, it's it's kind of bright

1218
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:23,000
It was behind you that guy said that and is like watching the stream on a delay and i'm on a delay

1219
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:33,560
Um, you're kind of describing the problem. I was having earlier

1220
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,079
I asked too many questions in a row and it was getting answers for the out of order

1221
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:52,560
Yeah, what's going on here?

1222
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,239
This is the entrance

1223
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,239
You pulled the big heavy door lever

1224
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:06,050
You guys having a good time?

1225
01:40:06,050 --> 01:40:08,279
Okay

1226
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:16,180
Somewhere a heavy door has opened. Oh, I think maybe because the desync. Oh come to come here. Oh wait when you crashed

1227
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:18,739
I think we never pulled that

1228
01:40:18,739 --> 01:40:23,829
Uh, because when you crashed out, it doesn't count technically, right? Yeah, come back up here

1229
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:31,319
Up to the beginning. Yeah, I don't think we'd been down here

1230
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:43,810
Nope, nothing in there. I mean, there's a heavy door somewhere. Hey, we're coming down these stairs

1231
01:40:44,449 --> 01:40:50,180
What? Sorry, I was I was when you when I was looking at chat. I'm sorry. I asked him a question

1232
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,920
frozen lightning spear

1233
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:56,850
I I got a spear too

1234
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:01,109
No, like the magic frozen lightning spear. Oh I

1235
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:05,189
You don't care about faith, right? Because I did get lightning spear dude

1236
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:14,000
If we kill ranala, I might go like faith because I have so much faith stuff bills are losing

1237
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:17,119
Oh, no

1238
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:24,680
Shit, not my bills

1239
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:40,319
Come on. Got him. That's a big wind-up

1240
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:59,439
There's something weird about fighting a boss from what that's not actually attacking you trying to gauge how close you are

1241
01:42:10,149 --> 01:42:11,829
I forgot he did that

1242
01:42:11,829 --> 01:42:25,060
Please don't kill me

1243
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:35,729
There's no way we can do this

1244
01:42:35,729 --> 01:42:38,130
Dude, i'm i'm sick of seeing these cookbooks

1245
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:42,239
At some point you're gonna get every single cookbook

1246
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:48,550
And then you're gonna get some cool stuff

1247
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:55,880
Let him cook. We still don't have we don't have the crafting thing to craft or cook. There's no cooking going on common bills

1248
01:42:56,359 --> 01:43:03,699
l

1249
01:43:03,859 --> 01:43:16,340
I guess they're are they playing right now? All right. How are you doing? You're leveling up. I actually

1250
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:20,720
I think I might be able to as well

1251
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:24,319
It's gonna be close

1252
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:27,359
17 18 000, I think it's 18

1253
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:33,340
Or 19

1254
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:48,510
Okay, what's my favorite vegetable to dice onions? Come on

1255
01:43:52,829 --> 01:43:56,350
Uh, sir, what's your favorite topping to go on a hot dog? I'll go first

1256
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,779
mine is

1257
01:43:59,779 --> 01:44:03,619
Dice onions control of the conversation at this point and I don't even get to answer

1258
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:07,140
what's your favorite by the way mine and you just keep talking and then

1259
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,100
Like don't even care. What is it though?

1260
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:13,460
No, what was yours yours first? It was yours was

1261
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,060
Uh

1262
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:17,500
diced onions

1263
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,579
cold not grilled diced onions

1264
01:44:20,979 --> 01:44:22,979
And maybe a little bit of tabasco

1265
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,699
and maybe maybe maybe a little mustard if I feel like it I

1266
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,260
I would usually say like

1267
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,260
I don't think opinion's gonna be wrong

1268
01:44:34,659 --> 01:44:36,659
But that was fucked up what you just said

1269
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:45,729
Why what about what about just just tabasco on a hot dog or tabasco and ketchup? I don't know

1270
01:44:45,729 --> 01:44:47,729
I like never have tabasco at all

1271
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:57,390
You know, it's really good. Um, like a uh, like pineapple I stuff pineapple

1272
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:04,319
I think I would if I had my choice of like the perfect well-made dog. It would be uh, like chili

1273
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:15,779
That's good because uh, I love sonic the hedgehog. He loves chili cheese dogs. I think yeah

1274
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:23,649
So like the hedgehog likes oh, we're oh we're in I didn't even see it change. Um, this guy's pretty easy

1275
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:28,289
What's normally even in these we've actually gotten pretty lucky on these. They're not bad at all

1276
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:56,640
Please do we cast something please let me do something

1277
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:02,720
God what the fuck can he just smash this controller down and he just threw his controller on the end of like the desk

1278
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:28,399
I got a death root. I got literal shit. Do you think it's time to attempt the

1279
01:46:30,029 --> 01:46:32,899
the the wall

1280
01:46:32,899 --> 01:46:39,060
The wall, I think we're I think we might be able to attempt the the real wall of the playthrough

1281
01:46:39,539 --> 01:46:42,819
I feel like we're pretty strong. I think we can I want to finish going up left here

1282
01:46:45,069 --> 01:46:47,729
This is the uh, the teleport towers

1283
01:46:49,619 --> 01:46:51,619
Get to the end of this path and then we'll go fight

1284
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:56,340
Placid u6 the queen of the moon and then followed by loretta

1285
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:08,220
immediately after um

1286
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:10,770
pineapple

1287
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:17,250
Very very small pineapple chunks not the big rings or anything not like big chunks little pineapple chunks part of like almost like a

1288
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,199
Like uh, oh man

1289
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:25,300
I there used to be this place in new jersey where it all began

1290
01:47:25,699 --> 01:47:29,949
It was like they would make uh, like icies

1291
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,949
like italian ices

1292
01:47:31,949 --> 01:47:35,310
But they would put like the chunks of the fruit in it and they had like a pineapple

1293
01:47:35,609 --> 01:47:44,239
Pina colada chunks of pineapple in it truly one of the goats hot dogs are it's weirdly enough hot dogs

1294
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:47,359
are one of the only foods that wacky combinations I

1295
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,500
Accept them and want them. I don't know what it is about hot dogs

1296
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:55,739
But I think it's just hot dogs are just like ah, it's a bunch of just fucking random ass meat. It's okay

1297
01:47:56,699 --> 01:48:02,859
Disgusting is a hot dog to you if it has no bun and no no toppings. No, that's fine for me

1298
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:06,619
Really? I I if I take like one bite i'm like i'm done

1299
01:48:07,779 --> 01:48:09,380
Well, that was that was enough

1300
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:14,989
You just mean like just a hot dog with not but do you put it like hot dogs and beans or hot dogs and anything else?

1301
01:48:15,149 --> 01:48:20,029
Just no a hot a hot dog like if I hand you a cooked hot dog and i'm like eat this

1302
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:22,909
Can you finish it? Yeah, I would i'd be able to

1303
01:48:23,869 --> 01:48:29,470
Like it's like same thing with bananas like a whole banana like bananas are too big. Let's be honest trees

1304
01:48:29,470 --> 01:48:34,479
What are you up to? Why is it that big? Do you want to use one of these?

1305
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,399
Do we even have one of these we don't but there's like a bonfire up here. I just want to get it

1306
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:41,569
Um, I think there's a chest on the top one

1307
01:48:44,899 --> 01:48:48,770
So funny how much people just flip on us this whole stream

1308
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:55,649
Everyone was saying germa l like super germa l now everyone's saying stir l wow

1309
01:48:56,130 --> 01:49:03,090
Comment stir l a hot dog without a bun and you're just like yeah, I want to suck it straight down

1310
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:07,250
I don't even chew them. Well, we're not doing like the I I I can shoot him like this

1311
01:49:08,369 --> 01:49:10,369
We're not doing that like meme video

1312
01:49:13,229 --> 01:49:17,869
I'm just saying okay. And again, it's not we're not talking like a sausage. It's not like a cheese filled

1313
01:49:17,949 --> 01:49:20,989
It's not it's like a just basic ass beef hot dog

1314
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,319
I mean, I would not prefer it

1315
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:26,319
But I okay if somebody was like hey

1316
01:49:26,909 --> 01:49:31,810
Well, how many times you've been in this have you been in this scenario before where you're at a barbecue or you're at a grill?

1317
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:35,470
Like a family get together friend get together, whatever it is and oh, hey

1318
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:40,590
Yeah, there's there's one or two hot dogs just left on the grill and there's no buns

1319
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:45,069
It's too much time too much effort to go through that actual

1320
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:49,229
Impossibility for me to eat those like a hot dog without a bun

1321
01:49:49,470 --> 01:49:55,550
It's they kind of gross me out hot dog with even like even a normal loaf of bread slice

1322
01:49:56,189 --> 01:50:02,699
Amazing. Yeah, but there's an on and off switch there for me. There's never been a scenario where you're just like, okay

1323
01:50:02,699 --> 01:50:06,939
There's only there's like a couple hot dogs left. I could still probably eat one and I don't really care

1324
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,420
It's grilled hot dog. Yes, let me give it to me. I'll eat it. I'll eat in three bites easy

1325
01:50:11,420 --> 01:50:14,000
No, can't do it. I I would feel like throwing up

1326
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:14,800
Okay

1327
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:32,479
I would I don't prefer it but I would eat it especially if it's grilled if it's grilled that takes it up a couple tears

1328
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:36,560
I think for me wanting to be able to do what we're talking about. Hey, you know, no one's perfect

1329
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:46,140
What was your had a take about bananas? Oh, it's like the same thing like bananas are too big

1330
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:52,930
I'll eat like a a big banana. I'll eat half of it and like that's enough. That's enough banana, right?

1331
01:50:53,250 --> 01:51:01,470
Can I change your whole life? Sure. Okay change my life germa. Do you who?

1332
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:10,609
You're you're a smoothie fan, right? Yeah, you are. Yeah, are you like a banana smoothie fan? Yeah

1333
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:11,810
Yeah, yeah

1334
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:16,689
What I would do is I would like cut the banana in half but half the banana and freeze the rest

1335
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:21,890
And then like the next time you have a smoothie you have like frozen banana

1336
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:28,819
Yeah, but how much banana what kind of banana are you doing strawberry? But my game crashed. Oh

1337
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:33,140
Strawberry banana is good. Yeah strawberry or blueberry

1338
01:51:34,369 --> 01:51:39,250
Uh, hopefully that didn't am I still yeah, i'm still alive. Okay. Um

1339
01:51:40,819 --> 01:51:46,640
Yeah, so strawberry banana strawberry. Do you do peanut butter banana peanut butter?

1340
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:51,439
No, I had it once and it kind of grossed me out, but I also feel like I could come around to the peanut butter

1341
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:56,670
Banana situation. I think that's you just you need to get the ratio right

1342
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:59,869
A lot of people when they make a peanut butter banana smoothie

1343
01:52:00,109 --> 01:52:06,189
They make a huge mistake and they add just a shit load of peanut butter and it becomes this thick peanut butter shake

1344
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:11,890
Light peanut butter extra banana. There's your there's the correct ratio you want less

1345
01:52:12,449 --> 01:52:19,279
Peanut butter versus banana for me. You know what? Maybe maybe this changes my life. Maybe it doesn't but i'll try it

1346
01:52:22,989 --> 01:52:27,170
Because I I think my first experience with the the peanut butter banana phenomena

1347
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:31,539
Like I ordered a smoothie and was not expecting it like I didn't even know

1348
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,500
And then I tasted it and was like and let me guess it was like how dare you it was like how dare you

1349
01:52:38,140 --> 01:52:40,510
You had to like kind of tip it back and it was like

1350
01:52:40,829 --> 01:52:46,289
Like it was like sludge almost right a little bit. You're right. That's what i'm saying. Oh through a straw

1351
01:52:46,369 --> 01:52:51,550
It's like do I gotta reinvite you or something? Yeah, I think you have probably put a new thing down here

1352
01:52:51,789 --> 01:52:57,659
I'm gonna i'm gonna use the banishing ball. You guys don't talk case when like you here's the straw and it's like

1353
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:12,399
Peanut butter banana smoothie peanut butter, right? That's a pretty bad sound. Are you still trying to like make more?

1354
01:53:13,340 --> 01:53:14,619
No

1355
01:53:14,619 --> 01:53:17,819
Farming, are you trying to make more sound effects?

1356
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:22,380
I don't know if it really should count as a category if you're just like intentionally farming it

1357
01:53:22,619 --> 01:53:29,939
I have to read this but no, I don't it was so stupid

1358
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:33,539
But uh, i'm gonna read it because like it's contextually funny

1359
01:53:34,939 --> 01:53:38,380
Uh, but no, i'm not gonna read it. I've already said it so I have to read it

1360
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:43,659
Oh my you have to now you're somebody said bro, it's not your suck game is just really bad

1361
01:53:46,909 --> 01:53:52,699
No, but it's possible. I wouldn't want to rule anything out

1362
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,460
You don't want to be sitting. All right

1363
01:53:56,859 --> 01:54:01,819
All right, first step focus focus focus up or maybe don't focus. We've been doing pretty well

1364
01:54:01,899 --> 01:54:07,659
Just rambling. Yeah when we don't focus lightning three light. I ain't gonna get hit. Whoa, that was different

1365
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:13,010
All right, placid do sex

1366
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:16,640
I'm doing so much more damage

1367
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:21,840
Oh my god, this is gonna be all right. I took a hit but you know what who gives a shit

1368
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,010
Quick quick talk about onions or something

1369
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:31,680
Uh, so my favorite thing about onions is the way they make you cry

1370
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:37,760
Like a bow

1371
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:03,630
Just honest this felt so fucking easy, dude, don't say that now

1372
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:11,279
See you you said that instead of talking about like something dumb and goofy and now now look what happened

1373
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:17,729
I got like

1374
01:55:17,729 --> 01:55:22,640
Games laggy

1375
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,640
That shouldn't have exploded on me

1376
01:55:25,090 --> 01:55:28,289
This game's fucking broken my game's broke. It's a broken game

1377
01:55:36,189 --> 01:55:38,189
Where is he?

1378
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:46,140
Where okay

1379
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:49,579
Playing hard to get

1380
01:55:49,579 --> 01:55:53,970
Mind you how did that miss lasers?

1381
01:55:55,069 --> 01:56:02,939
No, it's the fire

1382
01:56:02,939 --> 01:56:16,579
Watch the tail swipe

1383
01:56:16,579 --> 01:56:21,300
Um, he's stuck up there and he's doing he's doing lasers up there. This could ruin the whole thing

1384
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:28,270
I don't even he's stuck inside of the I don't know how we're gonna do this. He's he'll come down eventually

1385
01:56:28,989 --> 01:56:30,989
I might even be able to no I my

1386
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:33,630
Pebbles don't go far enough to the wall

1387
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:36,670
Oh, that's too bad. We could have just cheesed him

1388
01:56:40,579 --> 01:56:49,970
Thank god. All right

1389
01:56:49,970 --> 01:57:01,090
lasers

1390
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,689
my eyes

1391
01:57:02,689 --> 01:57:04,689
All right focus up

1392
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:06,720
focus focus

1393
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,880
focus on the prize

1394
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,909
we're at um

1395
01:57:10,909 --> 01:57:47,739
This is it. This shouldn't be too bad. You really shouldn't skipping spammer

1396
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:13,020
Remember forward dodge forward on those. Ow

1397
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:17,550
Damn, he got you good

1398
01:58:17,550 --> 01:58:18,909
Oh my goodness

1399
01:58:18,909 --> 01:58:36,189
That's weird. Oh

1400
01:58:36,189 --> 01:58:48,510
All right. Here comes second phase. I'm out of heals just play defensive if you have to

1401
01:58:58,189 --> 01:59:02,029
Uh, I hate to be weird and and or cringe. I have never fought this boss

1402
01:59:04,619 --> 01:59:05,659
Uh-oh

1403
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:08,670
I don't know this second phase

1404
01:59:09,409 --> 01:59:11,409
What have you?

1405
01:59:11,729 --> 01:59:14,449
That one I question i'm i'm confused on that one

1406
01:59:15,579 --> 01:59:17,579
I'm pretty sure there's a speedrun skip

1407
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:21,020
I learned it and I just skipped the boss

1408
01:59:23,409 --> 01:59:25,890
Oh, wait, no. No by the time you fight this boss

1409
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:31,729
You're so powerful that like I actually won like like stun locked insta phased it every time I fought it

1410
01:59:32,210 --> 01:59:34,770
So, you know I have fought this boss, but I haven't seen like

1411
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:37,569
I didn't know there was even a second phase

1412
01:59:38,529 --> 01:59:44,270
It's kind of more what's getting me

1413
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:46,270
All right. We got we got it. We're good

1414
01:59:47,149 --> 01:59:52,819
Nice

1415
01:59:52,819 --> 01:59:55,420
I got

1416
01:59:55,420 --> 02:00:03,489
We actually got some I got a lot of shit. I think I got one of the full medallions

1417
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:11,460
I have a sacred tear as well. I don't know if that was from earlier. That's a big deal

1418
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,350
Okay

1419
02:00:21,869 --> 02:00:33,359
I like this weapon. I like the thing it's doing. Yeah, I don't want a blood weapon

1420
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:36,640
Stones

1421
02:00:39,039 --> 02:00:44,340
I'm honestly, uh, i'm debating if I should like switch to faith because I have so much good faith stuff

1422
02:00:45,029 --> 02:00:48,470
Uh, this is the opportunity for us to both go. What do we actually want to do?

1423
02:00:52,930 --> 02:00:57,329
I guess if I do strength, I mean if i'm gonna have like 50 points in strength anyways

1424
02:00:58,050 --> 02:01:02,210
Then this thing's I could still use this if I wanted to

1425
02:01:10,899 --> 02:01:12,899
This thing is cool

1426
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:17,430
What's the what are my options my actual options?

1427
02:01:18,149 --> 02:01:25,319
This is regular smithing stones. This is somber this is somber, but this is faith

1428
02:01:31,479 --> 02:01:34,039
I like having one of each type of uh stone

1429
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:39,159
Oh, I have the uh rolled medallion for the grand lift of rolled. I have it fully completed

1430
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:49,800
So we can do that at some point i'll do these two

1431
02:01:50,659 --> 02:01:52,840
so I need to make I need 16

1432
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,340
int 50 strength and then

1433
02:01:57,489 --> 02:02:03,649
Just this just scales off of strength and i'll be good to go. I want to see what this weapon art is

1434
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:11,010
What about the god slayer?

1435
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:14,739
Are you going faith because we maybe we shouldn't do the same thing

1436
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:19,779
Ari, I i'm I I really want to use sorceries. I'm I'm thinking i'm not switching

1437
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:29,720
I have a lot of good stuff I could do if I did switch but I really don't actually want to so if you do

1438
02:02:30,439 --> 02:02:34,100
Okay

1439
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:49,189
I now it's coming down to uh coming down to aesthetics now for me cool this thing you raise up and you smash it and um

1440
02:02:49,750 --> 02:03:00,869
Fire comes out right what this sword it's like the magma worm sword. Okay, that's pretty cool

1441
02:03:01,189 --> 02:03:10,529
Yeah, this thing is really really cool looking

1442
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:28,600
Damn, this thing is pretty sick. I don't know swing it. Uh, we need to leave this area

1443
02:03:29,239 --> 02:03:33,460
The god slayer is dex

1444
02:03:33,859 --> 02:03:42,760
This is pretty fast for this kind of weapon

1445
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:49,439
I can't remember if this is good or super bad scar the rotten crystal sword builds up scarlet rot

1446
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:56,100
I can't remember if scarlet rot actually matters against bosses and things it does

1447
02:03:57,460 --> 02:04:02,020
If you get scarlet rot on a boss, it's takes a ton of damage away, especially if they're susceptible to it

1448
02:04:05,989 --> 02:04:07,989
Dex and yeah, this is a lot of dex

1449
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:23,880
I'm looking at you really weirdly, but you know what I mean?

1450
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:30,229
You're looking at me weirdly. No, I looked at the camera like directly into it like kind of like a like a weirdo

1451
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:35,939
um

1452
02:04:35,939 --> 02:04:39,380
No, this is annoying. I think i've made my decision

1453
02:04:40,199 --> 02:04:55,840
Let's um, let's go to the blacksmith. I think i've made my decision

1454
02:04:59,779 --> 02:05:02,100
Uh, yeah, hold on. Let me go back blacksmith. He said

1455
02:05:02,899 --> 02:05:04,210
Yeah

1456
02:05:04,210 --> 02:05:08,340
Unless you're respecting like right now and you're sure of it. No, you could do that first

1457
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:19,079
Yes, I am. All right. So i'm gonna be using the magma worm, uh scale sword

1458
02:05:19,399 --> 02:05:25,619
That's the weapon i'm choosing for the remainder of our run. Are you going like full strength attacking man?

1459
02:05:25,779 --> 02:05:29,060
I'm just going full super strength with a little bit of faith

1460
02:05:30,819 --> 02:05:34,100
To be able to use the magma guillotine ability

1461
02:05:34,739 --> 02:05:39,939
Oh kind of it kind of does make me actually want to go like fire caster and then we could be the like the magma brothers

1462
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:45,220
Yeah, that'd be cool. The only problem is what if we find somebody that's immune?

1463
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:52,560
Um, all right, let's do this. Yeah when lister the tormentor accidentally like just rolls immune to fire

1464
02:05:53,329 --> 02:05:57,079
He's like dude, come on. I'm a fucking meteor build

1465
02:05:58,310 --> 02:06:01,350
Okay, so let's get how much I should have at least what?

1466
02:06:01,989 --> 02:06:06,500
Yeah, you are you are saying a bunch of stuff that I like know. Okay. Okay

1467
02:06:12,579 --> 02:06:17,220
Okay, you are saying things that I know that's great cool

1468
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:20,020
Oh, that's that's crazy

1469
02:06:22,100 --> 02:06:26,520
Oh, man, man, that's crazy. Let me look over my shit if I actually did a switcheroo

1470
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:42,640
It's uh, I need 15 decks to put this on and then how much now this doesn't tell how much faith do I need here?

1471
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:47,430
Here's what's gonna happen. I'm banishing you. No, no, no, no, don't do that yet

1472
02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:54,880
But whatever we're gonna have like a a resource management session

1473
02:06:55,439 --> 02:07:45,699
I think we should just like banish so that we can go to round table. Hold I now

1474
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:55,909
Yep, let's see. I want to I don't think i've ever seen this moves weapons move before I feel like I have

1475
02:07:56,310 --> 02:08:08,340
Because I why don't why would I know what it is? Well, uh, that's fucking cool and it stays there

1476
02:08:08,739 --> 02:08:23,720
That's a great initiator. Watch this. Look what I can do now. Yeah, you do that in real life. You would die

1477
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,720
That's not realistic at all

1478
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:34,880
The lava would burn you. Yeah, that's right. That's true. I shouldn't like that. I shouldn't enjoy that anymore

1479
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:38,710
It was yeah, you're right. What should I like?

1480
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:45,010
Tell me what I should like then what what you should like? Yeah, because that was that's like not realistic and stupid

1481
02:08:45,010 --> 02:08:47,010
But what should I tell me what I should like?

1482
02:08:47,329 --> 02:08:49,729
No, you can like it, but it's not realistic

1483
02:08:50,289 --> 02:08:51,729
oh

1484
02:08:51,729 --> 02:08:53,750
All right. Do you want to like?

1485
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:57,350
Disconnect from each other and then just upgrade and stuff and then get back to it

1486
02:08:58,310 --> 02:09:00,869
Or what do you want to do? Are you did you respect?

1487
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:07,680
Uh, no, I didn't well go do what you need to do

1488
02:09:08,239 --> 02:09:23,829
The jumping r2 has wide range. I think a wide kind of area. It has a follow-up. Yeah

1489
02:09:28,199 --> 02:09:34,260
Whoa, it does

1490
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:49,859
It's that move that the magma worm does that's cool. All right. Can I how much can I upgrade this?

1491
02:10:00,529 --> 02:10:02,529
It does a lot of damage good

1492
02:10:04,449 --> 02:10:09,539
I don't know

1493
02:10:09,539 --> 02:10:15,920
Okay, I need somber smithing stone five. That's the hang up here

1494
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:21,000
Um, yeah, I don't have that either. Yeah

1495
02:10:22,039 --> 02:10:24,960
I'll double check

1496
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:26,239
180

1497
02:10:26,239 --> 02:10:32,960
I don't this is still I think technically better right because it has the fire the separate fire damage

1498
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:49,539
Maybe the ball bearings maybe now for the remainder of this. Do I put any more points in faith?

1499
02:10:52,069 --> 02:10:54,369
Or should I just start dumping?

1500
02:10:54,369 --> 02:11:00,449
stuff in um

1501
02:11:00,449 --> 02:11:03,590
No, just dumping into

1502
02:11:03,829 --> 02:11:28,369
Into vigor or endurance probably i'll get bigger to 30 now does that so what what's your plan?

1503
02:11:28,449 --> 02:11:30,449
Tell us we're dying to know

1504
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,880
Wait, what what's your what's your plan here? What do you what you what weapon are you trying to look at?

1505
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,159
What do you what's your strategy? I think i'm just gonna keep doing what i'm doing

1506
02:11:40,640 --> 02:12:01,319
Just kind of looking around what the shops are selling. This is a great weapon

1507
02:12:03,539 --> 02:12:11,649
I think I should buy this

1508
02:12:11,649 --> 02:12:12,689
this too

1509
02:12:12,689 --> 02:12:31,859
Um, you might as well just buy make sure you um in the shop. Make sure you're buying the flask

1510
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:37,380
Stuff is showing up randomly in shops for me. Yeah, our shops are different

1511
02:12:37,619 --> 02:12:43,439
Yeah, but just in case they're showing up in yours, too. If I see an item in a shop, that's good

1512
02:12:43,600 --> 02:13:25,600
I will I will buy it. This one's this one's d. This is pretty standard

1513
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:36,560
Is this the same guy that growled at us and turned purple yeah

1514
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:42,659
It is I can't deny that if I would just if I was if I said no

1515
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:46,439
No, I I didn't do that. You'd be like, what are you talking about?

1516
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:51,560
I am the guy that growled at somebody in chat and my face turned purple

1517
02:13:51,800 --> 02:14:00,609
It's this video evidence of this happening. So I can't say it didn't happen

1518
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:14,560
I can't say that it didn't happen. You could have just not read that

1519
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:19,760
Yeah, but then it's fun to read chat. I like I like reading just random chat messages fun

1520
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:25,439
Obviously if it's like a fun comment

1521
02:14:26,260 --> 02:14:43,720
Right. Okay. I am officially ready to continue whenever you are. I need a moment. I killed d

1522
02:14:44,279 --> 02:14:47,479
Well, you killed him

1523
02:14:47,479 --> 02:14:52,920
Like I I one of the merchants had his quest item and then he dies or was that roger?

1524
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,319
I don't know and then fia like vanished

1525
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:59,590
Who knows how these quests work?

1526
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:04,369
It's actually so cool that you don't know any of this

1527
02:15:06,609 --> 02:15:08,609
I like I like vaguely know

1528
02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:17,890
Almost everything but like vaguely. What is this clip? Everyone's linking that art? No

1529
02:15:21,939 --> 02:15:25,960
Just dumping into

1530
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:30,000
Into vigor that sir was making a sound effect. He was just

1531
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:33,430
No, no

1532
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:36,069
sir, did you or did you not like a few minutes ago go like

1533
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:40,550
Like you pressed your lips together and did like a kind of like an elephant sound

1534
02:15:41,569 --> 02:15:43,699
There it is

1535
02:15:43,699 --> 02:15:50,600
See, they thought you fart it. Yeah, they thought I farted when you did that into vigor see no

1536
02:15:51,239 --> 02:15:58,529
Sometimes when i'm lifting weights, I do that by accident and my wife laughs at me. You gotta you gotta breathe man

1537
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:01,250
Well, like you know, you got a brace

1538
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:04,579
I know then you like the air releases and

1539
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:13,380
You elephant a little bit stop replaying it. It's gross. It's not real. All right

1540
02:16:13,859 --> 02:16:18,199
It's not real. I need to I need to jump. What should I do?

1541
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:30,210
You know, I know what i'm gonna do. Oh the crafting isn't random. I know exactly what i'm gonna do

1542
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:39,030
Where is it? Is it not open yet? Where's that room chat that there it is. Okay. Do you have any smithing sevens?

1543
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:48,770
Just regular ones. Yeah, I do not. Okay. Once I get some sevens i'm gonna fully

1544
02:16:49,389 --> 02:17:17,700
Unleash I feel like you probably are i'm good. I guess i'm ready. I don't I didn't really do anything

1545
02:17:19,299 --> 02:17:24,979
Uh, if you want to just dump some of your stones, do you have any stone sword keys? I do bottom

1546
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:30,930
Down in the basement. Well, we shouldn't have to use both if you are have you already used yours

1547
02:17:31,430 --> 02:17:36,629
I just opened the chest down here at the round table in the basement

1548
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:41,399
There's the two what I mean is like you should have been in we should have been together when you did that

1549
02:17:41,639 --> 02:17:57,719
Which fair kind of onion? Uh, I don't know. I can't really tell the difference. There's always like white onion yellow

1550
02:17:57,799 --> 02:18:03,239
I can't I don't really I can't really tell. Yeah, it's kind of tricky. Sometimes red onions. Yeah, not a big thing. No

1551
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,440
I'll go yellow onion the yeah

1552
02:18:07,719 --> 02:18:10,149
Purple onion, whatever it is, right?

1553
02:18:10,149 --> 02:18:11,350
I want just

1554
02:18:11,350 --> 02:18:18,790
Yo, um

1555
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:24,319
Ready? Yeah, i'm ready. See you see what i'm gonna do right now is i'm gonna invite you to my game

1556
02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:29,120
How do I donate? Uh don't wow

1557
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:35,799
You're gonna come to my game and then i'm gonna give the death fruit to the guy because he's gonna give us an item

1558
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:40,420
And I want us both to get it. Okay, is your thing done? Yeah

1559
02:18:46,739 --> 02:19:00,229
I'm coming in what's wrong the way i'm walking. I've actually been walking like this

1560
02:19:00,229 --> 02:19:03,989
So it's extra funny to me french onion soup is good

1561
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:10,319
You gotta be in the mood for french onion soup because it's just kind of salt. It's just a very salty flavor

1562
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:12,319
It's very good flavor, but it's very salty

1563
02:19:13,329 --> 02:19:26,389
All right, ready r1 r1 r1 r1. Was it worth it? No, I didn't nothing. I didn't get anything

1564
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:35,159
Oh, I thought you would get it. Your theory was very sound in a lot of different potential hypothesis

1565
02:19:35,239 --> 02:19:50,709
Let's kill this boat guy. We've probably got the damage now and we do does he have more health than he's had before

1566
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:55,760
He had a lot before oh my god. We are doing thousands of damage to him

1567
02:20:05,409 --> 02:20:08,290
He did he scale higher or something for some reason?

1568
02:20:08,930 --> 02:20:13,649
No, this is about this. This makes sense. Does it I feel like he doesn't have this much hp

1569
02:20:18,450 --> 02:20:22,819
That didn't even do that much

1570
02:20:22,819 --> 02:20:25,059
And yes, he absolutely did did he?

1571
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:32,239
Watch out skeleton

1572
02:20:32,239 --> 02:20:35,760
I know you've heard me say this a few times but um, now i'm not gonna say it

1573
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:44,469
all right

1574
02:20:44,469 --> 02:20:46,469
But uh, are you?

1575
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:49,670
Am I you being are you absorbed? Are you being?

1576
02:20:50,229 --> 02:20:52,149
I look we're we're concentrating. I can't speak

1577
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:58,229
I'm am I being absorbed like the theory that I remember when I was like, oh no

1578
02:20:58,229 --> 02:21:00,950
I'm not gonna say it. I can't say it and you're like, yeah now you have to though

1579
02:21:02,850 --> 02:21:06,209
No, I realized also what I was gonna say was like you're factually incorrect

1580
02:21:08,049 --> 02:21:10,149
And I didn't want to be spreading misinformation

1581
02:21:11,329 --> 02:21:14,680
Good of you on the internet. It's good of you

1582
02:21:16,049 --> 02:21:28,100
I try

1583
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:30,180
Can is there? Oh, yeah, there is a backstab you can do

1584
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:33,120
Oh, no, I thought you just did it

1585
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,840
No, there is i'm pretty sure there is but I didn't do it. That's my the glint stone special

1586
02:21:38,639 --> 02:21:53,409
So maybe not. I don't think I don't think so

1587
02:21:58,629 --> 02:22:01,670
Use your weapon art. I have no fp. Does it use fp?

1588
02:22:04,129 --> 02:22:09,010
Probably. Yeah, it does

1589
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:12,209
It's a good thing. He only summoned the skeleton for like one attack. Yeah

1590
02:22:13,229 --> 02:22:16,850
88 000 souls dude, what is going on right now?

1591
02:22:17,649 --> 02:22:19,729
Is uh, he's a pretty

1592
02:22:20,530 --> 02:22:22,770
I mean that was more than radon's memory

1593
02:22:23,649 --> 02:22:27,670
So that's coming here and level up. Holy shit

1594
02:22:28,469 --> 02:22:49,639
That guy was rich. I feel like that's the safe thing to do

1595
02:22:50,690 --> 02:22:52,530
This is the thing I want to do

1596
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:58,479
I think that well, let's do safe

1597
02:22:59,350 --> 02:23:09,920
20 endurance get to 30 bigger and be good to go and then let's play safe. Let's do it safe. Let's do

1598
02:23:10,879 --> 02:23:12,000
safe

1599
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:24,530
Okay. Well, that was a big deal. Um

1600
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,920
I don't know if you want to fight stuff here. This is kind of like

1601
02:23:30,799 --> 02:23:32,840
you know

1602
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:34,840
the logical place to go is

1603
02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:38,149
up over to

1604
02:23:38,149 --> 02:23:41,030
plateau

1605
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:46,629
We could just stay. I mean, this is technically I think I have a teleporter that goes to red wait

1606
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:50,309
I don't know southern k-lit is where we need to be. We need to kill radan

1607
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,110
Oh, that stinks

1608
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:56,870
Yeah, I should have

1609
02:23:56,870 --> 02:24:02,340
What I don't know why I don't I ran all the way and got the radon waypoint and I don't have it

1610
02:24:04,549 --> 02:24:09,430
I want to go fight radon just to see like it's gonna be like a random guy in the middle of the desert

1611
02:24:10,389 --> 02:24:13,270
That's right. Why am I concerned about this? All right, let's um

1612
02:24:14,309 --> 02:24:16,549
Inner ionia is the closest i've got

1613
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:19,010
Really?

1614
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:29,680
You don't have the under stairs or the oh no, that's uh, yeah, I know what you mean radan's not active yet. Oh

1615
02:24:30,319 --> 02:24:32,319
We didn't kill godfrey

1616
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:34,239
Wait, no

1617
02:24:34,239 --> 02:24:40,360
We need to kill godric. We know we did kill godric. Didn't we? Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did

1618
02:24:42,659 --> 02:24:47,379
It's weird because it's all randomized. So we don't even know where what like how what progress we're on

1619
02:24:50,549 --> 02:24:51,590
what's the

1620
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:55,639
Yeah, we need to go to the plateau

1621
02:24:55,639 --> 02:25:00,440
Also, there's a boss right inside here if you want to do that because we're like, I think it was a dragon. Let's do it

1622
02:25:01,909 --> 02:25:06,879
To your right. I didn't want to go in here because I thought it was the commander and I hate the fight

1623
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:11,600
But like it's not

1624
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:25,559
That fight was really annoying

1625
02:25:25,639 --> 02:25:30,079
Is this even him this is the glint stone dragon, oh I got comet

1626
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:35,239
That's actually a huge deal

1627
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:37,120
Comet azure

1628
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:40,370
Just comet isn't comet azure like the crazy one

1629
02:25:50,639 --> 02:25:51,840
Holy shit

1630
02:25:51,840 --> 02:26:00,129
I don't know why I thought that was a good idea guys behind us like throwing shit out

1631
02:26:00,930 --> 02:26:02,930
Oh, that's oh there is

1632
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:05,969
They fucking got me

1633
02:26:05,969 --> 02:26:08,129
This guy's throwing like boomerangs over here

1634
02:26:09,010 --> 02:26:14,520
There's a guy with a ballista too

1635
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:20,479
You want me to well i'm dead anyways, never mind

1636
02:26:20,959 --> 02:26:22,159
Okay

1637
02:26:22,159 --> 02:26:25,920
I'm not sure that was even the boss because I I don't know. I think it is

1638
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:41,440
Jesus jesus

1639
02:26:41,440 --> 02:27:02,239
Shit i'm like trapped. Okay. There we go. This is weird. This doesn't feel right. That's better. Okay, uh

1640
02:27:04,159 --> 02:27:06,340
Where we going we're gonna kill this

1641
02:27:06,739 --> 02:27:10,659
Uh, did you rest to get rid of your debuff if you had it? That's thank you

1642
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:16,340
Why are you handcuffed to the chair?

1643
02:27:17,219 --> 02:27:21,540
That yeah, it's like what's happening. I can't get out of here. Oh, no, it wasn't the boss

1644
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:27,940
It's a magma worm

1645
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:32,819
Commander magma worm. It's a commander this time

1646
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:38,469
well

1647
02:27:38,469 --> 02:27:39,590
Okay

1648
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:43,909
I'm not seeing the names of things when you fight them, which is why I don't know the names of anything

1649
02:27:45,399 --> 02:27:47,000
You don't see it on the helper?

1650
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,760
Nope

1651
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:53,040
Like when it's a real like boss and it has an actual health bar

1652
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,959
This one is just like a normal enemy health bar to me really

1653
02:27:58,239 --> 02:27:59,120
Yeah

1654
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:18,020
Let's get off the horse. It's like makes it harder

1655
02:28:19,319 --> 02:28:21,319
Uh, I don't know what i'm being scarlet rotted by

1656
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:26,420
Is it the guy throwing boomerangs?

1657
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:27,780
I don't know

1658
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:30,500
It's still going up like what fire versus fire

1659
02:28:31,299 --> 02:28:35,829
There's something on the ground like what is happening to me

1660
02:28:36,629 --> 02:28:55,829
Okay, I guess just like the flowers on the ground do that. I've never seen that

1661
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:08,719
I probably shouldn't be doing that because some of that fire is mine and will not hurt you

1662
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:11,760
I'm like putting traps down for you

1663
02:29:13,139 --> 02:29:15,139
Doing a little bit of deception

1664
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:29,600
Did I not hit that at all?

1665
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:31,600
Yeah, I do. I have scarlet rot now, too

1666
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Yeah, standing in the flowers

1667
02:29:34,079 --> 02:29:36,319
On the edges of this arena are scarlet rot

1668
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:38,239
Shit

1669
02:29:38,239 --> 02:29:44,899
Oh, did you actually get a full build up?

1670
02:29:45,059 --> 02:29:47,059
Yeah, I did. I wasn't paying attention to it

1671
02:29:47,379 --> 02:29:51,920
You don't have a cure. I do

1672
02:29:52,000 --> 02:30:10,420
Got a lot better at that timing. Yes, it got me with it

1673
02:30:11,219 --> 02:30:13,620
Oh, I thought he was going the other way. I thought he's swinging that way

1674
02:30:35,399 --> 02:30:37,399
We're kind of pros at killing magma

1675
02:30:38,920 --> 02:30:41,729
Like it's the only boss in the game

1676
02:30:55,459 --> 02:30:57,379
Oh

1677
02:30:57,379 --> 02:30:59,379
He killed me be careful

1678
02:31:00,079 --> 02:31:05,780
I couldn't see where he was swinging it

1679
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:06,819
Oh

1680
02:31:06,819 --> 02:31:11,680
I thought he killed you for a second

1681
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,319
Okay

1682
02:31:14,319 --> 02:31:18,319
Yeah, I just saw I was just looking at his stomach and I was trying to gauge off of

1683
02:31:18,959 --> 02:31:22,639
When he was gonna swing by his like stomach undulations and I got it wrong

1684
02:31:26,260 --> 02:31:28,260
He's undulating. He's undulating

1685
02:31:28,739 --> 02:31:29,700
so

1686
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:32,100
Do I get so I get souls for that?

1687
02:31:32,659 --> 02:31:38,100
Weird right because technically i'm not sure I thought that I did when you killed the dragon that one time and I was dead

1688
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:39,860
During it, but then my souls were on the ground

1689
02:31:39,860 --> 02:31:45,750
So I think the souls that you were supposed to get you have to pick up now. I actually don't know

1690
02:31:45,989 --> 02:31:49,350
I think that yeah, I have zero. Oh, all right. That makes sense

1691
02:31:50,069 --> 02:31:52,069
All right, I get it

1692
02:31:59,360 --> 02:32:03,280
Wait, why they oh, okay

1693
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:09,959
I was looking at chat. Oh, uh, we came here to go do radan. I

1694
02:32:11,319 --> 02:32:13,319
You gotta remember sometimes i'm just kind of like

1695
02:32:13,559 --> 02:32:17,799
Walking forward and looking this way to look at what you guys are talking about. I want to be part of a conversation

1696
02:32:17,799 --> 02:32:19,319
I want to see what you guys are saying

1697
02:32:19,319 --> 02:32:21,319
What are you guys saying?

1698
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,040
all right

1699
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:39,520
I feel like people are coming into my chat first time chat from user

1700
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Did he ever mention the blender he uses?

1701
02:32:42,639 --> 02:32:44,639
like they're just like trying to get me to like

1702
02:32:44,719 --> 02:32:47,360
Like bait me into talking about some psycho shit you do

1703
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:50,309
Is that what they do here?

1704
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:54,120
Is that what you guys do?

1705
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:56,120
You guys just be like, oh, hey, dude. Um

1706
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:00,079
Do you ever played mouse trap the game?

1707
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:03,520
Like oh, yeah, I played mouse trap and let's talk about it. Is that what you guys do?

1708
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:10,879
I go. Hey man, like I just got uh back from uh, I just I just took like a flight to

1709
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:15,280
To miami and I had like some of the best, uh, like pizza i've ever had you like pizza

1710
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:20,239
Well, I maybe i'm reading too much into it that I feel like you have a blender story

1711
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,090
No

1712
02:33:23,090 --> 02:33:27,729
Okay, then he's legitimately wondering what your blender is because he says he made a smoothie and it was bad

1713
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:30,719
It's I think he needs advice

1714
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,040
Wait, hold on

1715
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:38,000
Way wrong. Hold on a second. Somebody came into your chat and asked. Hey, man. I made a wicked fucked up smoothie

1716
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:44,000
It sucked. What do I do? 30 minutes ago was like, yeah, I like smoothies, too

1717
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:45,909
uh

1718
02:33:45,909 --> 02:33:47,909
What blender does he use?

1719
02:33:48,870 --> 02:33:51,190
Why what why who is what silver tier?

1720
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:56,260
What is this red name?

1721
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:57,139
Huh?

1722
02:33:57,139 --> 02:33:59,540
Does somebody just fight this like a person fighting here?

1723
02:34:00,340 --> 02:34:06,979
I don't know. I don't see it. What the fuck is this? Oh, yeah. I saw this guy earlier. I thought it was you

1724
02:34:09,270 --> 02:34:11,270
There's just a regular guy

1725
02:34:11,350 --> 02:34:13,350
Why is he naked?

1726
02:34:13,430 --> 02:34:17,139
Is this

1727
02:34:17,139 --> 02:34:25,190
Whoa?

1728
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:31,280
Who is that?

1729
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,520
Uh, anyways

1730
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,280
Here's the thing about making a smoothie and don't fuck this up. It's so easy to put hold on

1731
02:34:37,360 --> 02:34:42,079
This is legendary put your hand in the blender. No, no, listen. Yes. Don't do that. That's

1732
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:44,239
But listen to me

1733
02:34:44,239 --> 02:34:46,239
People I do this too all the time

1734
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,020
And I got another remembrance

1735
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:54,159
You're just fighting random guys

1736
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:58,600
Okay

1737
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:04,440
A lot of times when you have a blender you'll put way too much shit in it. You'll put a you

1738
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:10,760
Oh, I guess it's a it's a it's a strawberry banana smoothie may as well put a three handfuls of strawberries in here

1739
02:35:11,239 --> 02:35:15,579
Don't do that. You don't actually need to use that much material

1740
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:21,159
and easy on the liquid people just dump a shit load of liquid in there and they have like

1741
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:27,010
Oh my god, and I did the crystal knight kill you

1742
02:35:27,809 --> 02:35:30,049
No, I was trying to get up this tower this tower

1743
02:35:30,770 --> 02:35:32,930
I I thought it would be easier with random enemies

1744
02:35:33,489 --> 02:35:35,489
It's not let me help this person

1745
02:35:36,920 --> 02:35:40,280
When you are making a smoothie if you want to thicken up a smoothie a little bit

1746
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,840
The easiest way to do that

1747
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:44,840
Is to just use a little bit of yogurt

1748
02:35:45,239 --> 02:35:49,479
Just get some plain or maybe vanilla just greek yogurt

1749
02:35:50,520 --> 02:35:53,239
If it's like, oh, this is a little too thin. I don't know just like

1750
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:55,879
a little bitty greek yogurt

1751
02:35:55,879 --> 02:35:57,639
Bingo done

1752
02:35:57,639 --> 02:36:00,520
And then if it's too thick then you put a little water in no don't put water

1753
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:04,040
You want to you're putting water put some more greek yogurt in

1754
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:06,680
You don't know when you're not when don't use water

1755
02:36:07,799 --> 02:36:11,159
The base of your smoothie should be only a few things. Uh, excuse me

1756
02:36:11,239 --> 02:36:15,559
The base of the human fucking body is water. Why not water?

1757
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:19,200
because

1758
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:25,000
It's going to mess with the flavor profile and it's gonna be too thin. Oh the water is gonna have too much flavor

1759
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:33,360
It's gonna throw everything off story. You can keep using water and keep making dog shit ass smoothies. That's fine with me

1760
02:36:36,399 --> 02:36:38,840
So and drink water

1761
02:36:39,319 --> 02:36:40,600
So

1762
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:42,600
I'm gonna recommend you oat milk

1763
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:44,920
I'm also gonna recommend you

1764
02:36:47,110 --> 02:36:48,469
It happened

1765
02:36:48,469 --> 02:36:53,350
It was in your chat and i'm doing it. This is the thing that you told me happens. You are the guy

1766
02:36:53,909 --> 02:36:58,229
Teaching me how to punch the thing that the story no, no, that's different

1767
02:36:58,469 --> 02:37:02,790
If you had walked up to that guy and said hey, uh, I just punched this thing and I don't get it

1768
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:07,190
Can you you look like a big strong guy? Can you help me? That's not what happened. This person asked you

1769
02:37:07,590 --> 02:37:09,590
This person came up and asked you

1770
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:15,319
You didn't walk up to that guy at this restaurant and you didn't walk up to this guy and say hey

1771
02:37:15,319 --> 02:37:20,200
I need some help. Could you explain to me what what your strategy is? Let's take two steps back

1772
02:37:20,520 --> 02:37:28,520
He asked what blender do you use and you're on about fucking what milk you haven't mentioned the blender

1773
02:37:29,409 --> 02:37:33,409
Because you told me that didn't you say this person like had a problem. They messed up

1774
02:37:34,049 --> 02:37:37,090
Asked what blender you use you added context to it though

1775
02:37:38,579 --> 02:37:43,540
You said oh he he screwed up his smoothie real bad. Can we hear what blender you're using?

1776
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:47,799
I have a vitamix

1777
02:37:47,799 --> 02:37:48,840
There you go

1778
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:54,149
Oh, that was easy. That was really easy. I should do that more often

1779
02:37:54,709 --> 02:37:56,549
Where are you? You're like

1780
02:37:56,549 --> 02:38:00,389
I went up the uh up top. Oh, I reset the enemies for you

1781
02:38:01,799 --> 02:38:06,370
There's a chest up here if you want

1782
02:38:06,370 --> 02:38:12,549
I've already been up there

1783
02:38:12,549 --> 02:38:14,549
Vitamix lul what?

1784
02:38:17,860 --> 02:38:23,170
And that's what happens when I read chat. I'm fine. Um, what's wrong with vitamix?

1785
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:28,819
Yeah, I mean they're a little pricey. They are they are but it's like a

1786
02:38:29,620 --> 02:38:33,219
If you if you listen if you are making stuff in a blender all the time

1787
02:38:34,290 --> 02:38:36,290
It's crashed your game crashed

1788
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:44,959
That's a common vitamix l what are you talking about? They're like they're

1789
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:50,239
It's like an industry standard blender. Oh, I don't know. I use the ninja

1790
02:38:52,719 --> 02:38:54,879
Those are fine, too. That's wrong. There's nothing wrong with that

1791
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:02,840
I have one. It's great. Yeah, if you can

1792
02:39:03,319 --> 02:39:05,639
If i'm if you're big big into

1793
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:08,760
Putting stuff in a blender smoothies, you know like

1794
02:39:09,559 --> 02:39:14,520
Making like soups and shit making sauces and like pastes and garlic and

1795
02:39:15,799 --> 02:39:22,530
Making all kinds of cool shit, right? I don't do any of that. I I make smoothies only

1796
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:29,879
Let me tell you ask if you do you you're like you're talking about it

1797
02:39:29,879 --> 02:39:32,360
Like you do it like you have experience and I was like man

1798
02:39:33,399 --> 02:39:36,040
I've been wanting to make like some homemade chili

1799
02:39:36,600 --> 02:39:44,690
For a while, but I also just don't want to do it. I have made I did my reinvite to you

1800
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:53,270
I I that's kind of not true. I do I have made hummus a few times homemade hummus is actually fantastic. Although I

1801
02:39:53,829 --> 02:39:54,870
Last time I did it

1802
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:58,319
I put like way too much garlic and way too much lemon juice in it

1803
02:39:58,319 --> 02:40:05,639
And I gave myself wicked bad heartburn for like three days three. Oh, it was bad. It was fucking awful

1804
02:40:07,879 --> 02:40:12,790
That's why you didn't stream those three days guys. You're like, where's jerma? That's right

1805
02:40:13,879 --> 02:40:19,159
Some wicked wicked sick amount of fucking garlic. You could do that in a food processor

1806
02:40:19,159 --> 02:40:27,110
Yeah, but you can also make milkshakes in this thing. You can also make smoothies and and it pulverizes shit a vitamix

1807
02:40:28,979 --> 02:40:33,719
Pulverize my game crashed

1808
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:45,399
I got a I got a view of that what that looked like I saw that I did like a pog face

1809
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:53,840
It snapped to like a what was that? Did you guys see that? You can just you can be let's be cheaters

1810
02:40:54,159 --> 02:40:59,559
What do you mean? Can't you just jump off the mountain and end up in radon's arena?

1811
02:41:02,079 --> 02:41:05,760
Maybe I don't know how to all right. I have a question for you. This is very serious

1812
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:10,719
How do you know all these like wacky speedrun strats, but you didn't see like

1813
02:41:11,379 --> 02:41:19,159
Loretta why if you know the wacky speedrun strats, then you'd miss a lot of shit true

1814
02:41:20,579 --> 02:41:21,620
Yeah, that's what I mean

1815
02:41:21,620 --> 02:41:24,819
Like I remember loretta, but you would just like walk into the arena

1816
02:41:25,299 --> 02:41:28,180
And then there was like a setup to like hit her three times with a great sword

1817
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:32,739
Then she would stagger then you'd kill her and then you'd just walk out of the arena like she's dead already

1818
02:41:33,729 --> 02:41:35,889
So when it was like, oh, there's a face. I had no idea

1819
02:41:35,889 --> 02:41:40,680
She had a face too and I probably actually killed her like four or five times. That's insane

1820
02:41:50,659 --> 02:41:55,649
But anyways it this shit gets pulverized. It's not just like a little ring ring ring

1821
02:41:56,690 --> 02:41:58,690
I'm telling you right now. I'm serious

1822
02:41:58,690 --> 02:42:05,090
Sometimes I feel like when I turn the blender on when I turn on my vitamix and it's like this thing's fucking powerful, dude

1823
02:42:07,010 --> 02:42:11,569
It's like when you're talking to an npc in a game and you accidentally selected the dialogue option

1824
02:42:11,649 --> 02:42:17,729
You've already heard I was like, oh tell me about the castle. Oh, yeah, we're don and loretta and then like, okay

1825
02:42:17,809 --> 02:42:20,450
Tell me about the mic. Oh fuck. I did the mixer one again

1826
02:42:21,170 --> 02:42:33,510
I'm gonna finish this last thought and then we're gonna stop wait. I seriously I feel sometimes sometimes

1827
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:41,280
You can't skip this cut scene. I'm sorry. It's grayed out. It's like you're tapping start

1828
02:42:42,159 --> 02:42:45,600
This is important lore. This is a storyline cut scene

1829
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:49,649
You can't skip this one when I turn my blender on and I turned up powerful

1830
02:42:49,649 --> 02:42:53,879
Sometimes I feel like my lights flicker because it's so powerful

1831
02:42:54,680 --> 02:42:57,799
Like sometimes it's like oh my here we go. This thing's got like a million

1832
02:42:57,799 --> 02:43:10,120
It's it thinks this thing's going and it's like wait a minute. What's happening. These things are powerful dudes bragging right now

1833
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:17,280
Talking about like someone talk about their car what engine it's got. Oh my blender man. My blends are

1834
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:27,250
Can you let's get this thing rocking who wants a smoothie? Oh you do you do here we go. All right

1835
02:43:30,129 --> 02:43:41,750
You fucking just blow out a whole neighborhood. Oh god, geez

1836
02:43:45,350 --> 02:43:48,680
You're too wild. I'm not really is we're just

1837
02:43:49,479 --> 02:43:56,000
This is not even a weird conversation. It's just we're just talking. This is a great script tonight

1838
02:43:56,559 --> 02:43:58,799
We're just talking

1839
02:43:58,799 --> 02:44:06,069
Super saiyan blender now. I love my vitamix. Don't you dare talk about it like it's bad

1840
02:44:07,459 --> 02:44:13,860
I don't even know i'm not invested in this. I just want you to join my game i'm coming

1841
02:44:26,440 --> 02:44:37,219
Nuclear powered blender to be fair. It hasn't done that in a long time

1842
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:43,780
But that's still funny

1843
02:44:43,780 --> 02:44:49,059
Yes, I don't remember when this activates but we can't use it. I think we we have to go across the bridge

1844
02:44:49,459 --> 02:44:52,100
Or can you I remember they like shoot missiles at you?

1845
02:44:52,659 --> 02:44:56,659
Yeah, they shoot a lot. We I think we have to go sit at a bonfire in the plateau

1846
02:45:00,709 --> 02:45:05,510
There's also that tower nearby that has like 400 million items all around it

1847
02:45:07,409 --> 02:45:11,729
Has it done it before it probably hasn't even ever done it. I just like feel like it's happening

1848
02:45:14,290 --> 02:45:16,450
I don't know something. It's this thing is powerful

1849
02:45:17,329 --> 02:45:19,329
All right. All right, you know what just

1850
02:45:20,450 --> 02:45:24,209
So much it changes this perception of reality like my lights are flick

1851
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:27,010
I don't know for real if they are but they could be

1852
02:45:27,649 --> 02:45:30,770
Because it's that powerful. No this thing I

1853
02:45:31,409 --> 02:45:35,889
This thing has like it's like a 10 speed. I don't think i've ever made it go past like six

1854
02:45:36,629 --> 02:45:42,549
I guess you're scared. You have no idea happen if I go to no, no this these things are legit. These are legit

1855
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:47,440
His vision goes dark

1856
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:54,319
They sell it and they say you're only gonna need to go to five we've never tested it at six

1857
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:59,280
We definitely don't want to go to seven and ten will definitely fuck you up

1858
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:01,280
It's like seven eight like

1859
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:05,280
How it starts to shake like a coffee cup is on the counter

1860
02:46:06,799 --> 02:46:11,639
The coffee's kind of like t rexon. We don't know what could happen

1861
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:17,969
Oh, didn't you want to come here?

1862
02:46:17,969 --> 02:46:28,209
No, but why not? Why not like at the bonnie? I think you can buy different things from here. Yeah

1863
02:46:29,010 --> 02:46:31,969
Like you can buy stuff from here, but it costs the dragon

1864
02:46:32,530 --> 02:46:38,500
Thingies really because I have a few of them. I got some decent stuff in here actually

1865
02:46:41,329 --> 02:46:43,329
Now I can drop spells

1866
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:47,540
Let me ask you if any of these are doing it for you because I could just buy them

1867
02:46:49,719 --> 02:46:51,719
I have great heal

1868
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:55,000
You have a dragon heart. I have three dragon hearts. Oh

1869
02:46:56,200 --> 02:47:00,319
Great great heal

1870
02:47:00,319 --> 02:47:06,129
Uh lord's divine. Do you need me to read what they do? No lord's divine fortification

1871
02:47:07,889 --> 02:47:15,190
Elden stars, which is 50 faith. It's the elden beast remembrance spell probably sucks

1872
02:47:16,899 --> 02:47:18,180
This is all faith

1873
02:47:18,180 --> 02:47:20,180
uh black flame

1874
02:47:20,719 --> 02:47:22,719
bestial constitution

1875
02:47:23,219 --> 02:47:25,780
Or bestial vitality

1876
02:47:25,860 --> 02:47:31,940
I could go for the heel because if I switch I would kind of like to be like a heel bot fireman faith caster

1877
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:34,500
But i'm not sure i'm gonna great heal

1878
02:47:34,899 --> 02:47:36,850
Yeah

1879
02:47:36,850 --> 02:47:38,850
Okay, let me see if I can put it. Do you want anything else?

1880
02:47:39,489 --> 02:47:50,850
Am I gonna turn to a dragon maybe i've got the carrion knight sword in here, which I kind of want but I can't

1881
02:47:51,729 --> 02:47:53,729
Um drop the dragon heart

1882
02:47:53,729 --> 02:48:08,959
I cannot drop the drop the hearts. I drop the other spell I have to just in case you use it. Okay, let's uh continue

1883
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:13,270
On our quest to how do we activate the dawn man?

1884
02:48:13,829 --> 02:48:16,450
I can't believe you got one guide

1885
02:48:16,610 --> 02:48:18,610
in somebody else's chat

1886
02:48:19,329 --> 02:48:22,440
It was an important topic

1887
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:28,200
He can talk to you. He can take command of a conversation if it's something that he has great expertise in

1888
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And that just happened to be one of the things

1889
02:48:31,879 --> 02:48:37,479
I i'm not even an expert. I told you I don't even like I I use it to make a few very important things

1890
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:57,940
Dragon

1891
02:48:57,940 --> 02:49:00,069
Oh my god

1892
02:49:00,069 --> 02:49:05,559
That's a lot of damage

1893
02:49:05,559 --> 02:49:10,200
That's the biggest spread. I kind of don't even want to fight him. I'm bored of him

1894
02:49:11,079 --> 02:49:13,319
I don't want to play with this anymore. Do you want to leave?

1895
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:15,719
Yeah, okay

1896
02:49:15,719 --> 02:49:19,639
We're all we're just fighting dragons and salamanders back to back to back

1897
02:49:22,229 --> 02:49:23,190
so

1898
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:26,229
If it randomizes every enemy and it randomizes everything, right?

1899
02:49:27,190 --> 02:49:29,190
Does that mean that?

1900
02:49:30,549 --> 02:49:35,670
Have we seen what can a duplicate happen? Have we seen a duplicate worm or their four worms don't happen

1901
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:38,870
But there's a lot of worms and there's a lot of dragons. Yeah, that's true

1902
02:49:39,829 --> 02:49:44,719
So I don't think we'll see another worm then I think there's only four worms in the game

1903
02:49:45,680 --> 02:49:50,079
Weird we have we got them all how have we not seen an ulcerated spirit. There's like 10 of those

1904
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:58,120
uh

1905
02:49:58,120 --> 02:49:59,909
We did

1906
02:49:59,909 --> 02:50:01,909
Didn't we I think we only saw one

1907
02:50:04,680 --> 02:50:09,559
Oh, we've only seen one of the jump trees as well. Do you want uh the wait, is this a

1908
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:15,139
Is this a talisman?

1909
02:50:15,139 --> 02:50:21,799
You should probably take this if it is is it yeah, it sucks

1910
02:50:24,280 --> 02:50:28,450
Do you want this charm that raises focus? No

1911
02:50:35,489 --> 02:50:40,690
Why did I just buy this it was 100 more expensive. I just got lazy because I didn't feel like okay

1912
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:54,500
Why are you killing this merchant?

1913
02:50:55,329 --> 02:50:57,329
Sell something I can use

1914
02:50:58,420 --> 02:51:06,420
You're no merchant

1915
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:08,340
Let's go. Hey, that's fine

1916
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:10,340
Let's go cops coming you can uh

1917
02:51:11,299 --> 02:51:13,940
You can do the dishonorable kills and d rank. I don't care

1918
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:21,979
I've ever been in wow groups. Oh, we're gonna let's go to the crossroads

1919
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:25,879
And it's like once once somebody started killing like the civilians

1920
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:29,959
It's just like people just start spamming dropping group. It was like the biggest troll

1921
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:33,159
with somebody because if you were part of a group

1922
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:36,600
And you people started killing civilians

1923
02:51:37,319 --> 02:51:39,319
You would lose honor

1924
02:51:39,799 --> 02:51:44,280
So people would just be in groups like oh, yeah, we're gonna go to the crossroads. It's gonna be so much fun

1925
02:51:44,360 --> 02:51:46,360
Oh, don't do any dishonorable kills though

1926
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:48,600
And then all of a sudden you'd see

1927
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:53,719
Dishorrible kill disorder and somebody was just killing them and it was just like what the fuck dude like you just ruined everything

1928
02:51:53,719 --> 02:51:55,719
You just ruined like a week's worth of work for me

1929
02:51:58,420 --> 02:52:00,180
How does that ruin work for you?

1930
02:52:00,180 --> 02:52:05,159
Because it would d rank you because you had honorable kills honor and dishonor

1931
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:09,219
reign of stars

1932
02:52:09,299 --> 02:52:14,290
bounding reign of stars

1933
02:52:14,290 --> 02:52:16,129
There are items on the top of the skull. That's right

1934
02:52:16,129 --> 02:52:20,129
There are let's uh, we're gonna go through the town and fight the uh the boss in here

1935
02:52:20,290 --> 02:52:23,250
Which is gonna be two bosses and it's gonna be fun. Yeah

1936
02:52:24,049 --> 02:52:27,010
Didn't know you were into wow pvp. I mean it wasn't really

1937
02:52:27,889 --> 02:52:29,889
But I mean it existed

1938
02:52:35,329 --> 02:52:37,329
Oh, we gotta do the thing to open the door

1939
02:52:40,659 --> 02:52:44,690
No magical crab

1940
02:52:44,690 --> 02:52:48,209
Ghost crab ghost crab magical puke or whatever. Their names are

1941
02:52:51,559 --> 02:53:18,040
the puke punk

1942
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:20,040
But that was very weird

1943
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:22,690
Okay

1944
02:53:22,690 --> 02:53:32,680
piece of shit

1945
02:53:32,680 --> 02:53:36,680
You're in so much. Oh, I I was I had a great view of that

1946
02:53:37,489 --> 02:53:40,129
If you had gotten hit by that on the ladder and fell down. Oh my god

1947
02:53:40,290 --> 02:53:48,200
You know how many louds there would have been air cannon down there. Watch out. I fell I pressed

1948
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:54,520
Oh, I did press jump. Yeah, you're just watching me do that. There's like three towers to do and you're just watching me do one

1949
02:53:55,399 --> 02:53:59,190
You'll be all right

1950
02:53:59,190 --> 02:54:16,389
Yeah, i'll be all right

1951
02:54:16,389 --> 02:54:20,389
My second jump isn't working sometimes though. It really isn't I think we're lagging a little

1952
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:23,030
And the inputs aren't being there

1953
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:26,770
probably

1954
02:54:26,770 --> 02:54:30,950
No, I want to do it. You had plenty of time

1955
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:38,280
Uh, that was it. I think I did the other one

1956
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:44,840
Like yesterday really here. I'm gonna comment that that guy this guy I can lock onto it

1957
02:54:45,559 --> 02:54:50,450
I can't get on my horse and I can't lock onto it

1958
02:55:09,989 --> 02:55:12,549
Cool. Nice nice shot

1959
02:55:13,840 --> 02:55:17,280
All right. So from here we got a this chest down the street

1960
02:55:18,079 --> 02:55:22,440
Make sure you get the chest

1961
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:24,309
Okay

1962
02:55:24,309 --> 02:55:30,180
browses

1963
02:55:30,180 --> 02:55:31,719
Academy scroll

1964
02:55:31,719 --> 02:55:33,719
He's almost 40 dot dot dot

1965
02:55:35,959 --> 02:55:38,049
Yeah, I know

1966
02:55:38,049 --> 02:55:39,920
I know

1967
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:46,920
I know it's unfortunate how when you turn 40 they put you in a box and just push you out in the sea

1968
02:55:48,309 --> 02:55:54,709
I'm just floating out there. You just see like millions of other boxes just floating around individual boxes

1969
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:57,510
I thought this was a bonfire

1970
02:55:58,149 --> 02:56:00,149
I guess um

1971
02:56:00,610 --> 02:56:02,610
We go downstairs. Why is this not open?

1972
02:56:03,250 --> 02:56:08,959
Because that one doesn't open yet. Uh, you gotta you gotta go down here and

1973
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:12,500
I just thought that was a bonfire for some reason

1974
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:21,520
Okay, elden beast

1975
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,159
with his buddy

1976
02:56:24,159 --> 02:56:25,680
another dragon

1977
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:31,520
If it's a magma worm, I I don't want to say anything. Okay. Oh, it's just one

1978
02:56:32,559 --> 02:56:34,020
uh

1979
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:40,020
This is bad. But yeah, this might be this is gonna be awful. Look at how small this is. Well, he can't run away

1980
02:56:40,500 --> 02:56:44,979
Yeah, but he's he's gonna do the bubble burst explosive bursting move and it's gonna hit us

1981
02:56:46,020 --> 02:56:48,020
I don't i've never heard of that

1982
02:56:48,579 --> 02:56:50,579
Well, he's doing it right now

1983
02:56:51,219 --> 02:56:53,219
Yeah, this isn't real

1984
02:56:53,379 --> 02:57:13,840
I'm gonna hit him soon

1985
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,200
Jesus

1986
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:27,489
I don't know if that's helping or

1987
02:57:28,079 --> 02:57:33,520
His body is in such weird positions on the walls. It's so hard to find like a foot on the ground. Yeah

1988
02:57:45,809 --> 02:57:48,049
There it is

1989
02:57:48,049 --> 02:57:49,889
I'm gonna do it in three

1990
02:57:49,889 --> 02:57:50,770
two

1991
02:57:50,770 --> 02:57:55,809
Um not a little late. Yeah, he he moved that was he moved around weirdly and like went up the wall

1992
02:57:56,850 --> 02:58:17,639
God damn it. Oh god. This is it. He's doing this the thing I was talking about

1993
02:58:20,899 --> 02:58:24,500
I can't believe he didn't hit us. Let's just hope he doesn't do it again. I didn't even see anything

1994
02:58:32,879 --> 02:58:34,559
Oh, come on, man

1995
02:58:34,559 --> 02:58:40,159
Okay, I thought you'd jump over it. I guess not

1996
02:58:46,399 --> 02:58:48,399
Are you serious?

1997
02:58:49,090 --> 02:58:50,690
He's gonna kill me

1998
02:58:50,690 --> 02:58:52,690
What killed you? How did you die?

1999
02:58:54,129 --> 02:58:56,129
What did you die?

2000
02:58:56,209 --> 02:58:58,209
I also got grabbed by one

2001
02:58:59,590 --> 02:59:01,590
There were two what?

2002
02:59:05,059 --> 02:59:07,059
Okay, let me focus here never

2003
02:59:07,379 --> 02:59:12,610
What was that?

2004
02:59:12,610 --> 02:59:17,649
Nothing what happened grabbed both of us with the same I don't I don't know what happened

2005
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:30,680
The other astle from snowfield was the ground ground was shaken. Maybe it was a desync

2006
02:59:31,239 --> 02:59:36,899
Maybe yeah, maybe you did get desync or something. No, they said the uh, the there's the other astle

2007
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:44,920
Duplicates itself or something. Oh and they're just so close to each other maybe

2008
02:59:46,819 --> 02:59:50,739
You know because he like changed colors and like clones of him both went for me and you

2009
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:57,540
Okay, well I didn't even have full flasks and you know

2010
02:59:58,979 --> 02:59:59,860
Yeah

2011
02:59:59,860 --> 03:00:04,260
I'm just saying that that like wasn't fair. I'm out the door

2012
03:00:04,979 --> 03:00:07,540
Proof that it wasn't an instant kill move

2013
03:00:09,840 --> 03:00:11,840
Yeah, but I mean

2014
03:00:13,270 --> 03:00:15,780
It is

2015
03:00:15,780 --> 03:00:18,659
Your health is your health was just really low. Yeah, but it is though

2016
03:00:20,340 --> 03:00:40,209
How's that not a leg? Oh it is it was weird

2017
03:00:40,850 --> 03:00:50,069
He's got to be close to stun

2018
03:00:50,319 --> 03:00:51,600
I think he is

2019
03:00:51,600 --> 03:01:01,399
Especially in the head

2020
03:01:01,399 --> 03:01:03,399
Really? I thought that was gonna do it

2021
03:01:11,120 --> 03:01:20,870
Okay, that was weird

2022
03:01:20,870 --> 03:01:24,549
Uh as janky as this is i'm liking this a lot more than the real astle fight

2023
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:30,340
That yeah the fight sucks

2024
03:01:30,340 --> 03:01:34,180
The real astle fight and the elden beast fight are the same annoyance for me is like

2025
03:01:34,180 --> 03:01:37,540
Oh, it's a gigantic huge area and i'm just gonna literally disappear

2026
03:01:38,840 --> 03:01:42,229
And uh be across the whole game

2027
03:01:42,229 --> 03:01:47,479
You want to run at me again?

2028
03:01:47,559 --> 03:01:52,360
I still can't believe that that elden beast fight is not a horse fight. I feel like it was was supposed to be

2029
03:01:53,319 --> 03:02:11,590
What the fuck

2030
03:02:11,590 --> 03:02:18,360
I can't believe he's not stagger. This is crazy. I haven't hit him in a while but

2031
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:31,360
Okay, see that time two went for me. It felt like they were that was weird

2032
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Oh, he caught you what it was

2033
03:02:34,079 --> 03:02:36,079
I there was like 15 hands

2034
03:02:36,639 --> 03:02:41,569
I like 10 hands came up to grab me

2035
03:02:45,250 --> 03:02:46,530
You got this

2036
03:02:46,530 --> 03:02:51,920
I drank one too many

2037
03:02:51,920 --> 03:03:04,440
You got it. I think he's fucking

2038
03:03:07,909 --> 03:03:09,829
Doing astle shit

2039
03:03:16,159 --> 03:03:40,319
Okay, no more healing

2040
03:03:40,319 --> 03:03:43,280
That was that was wacky. That was goofy. So was that

2041
03:03:45,649 --> 03:03:47,649
I hope he doesn't do another aoe attack

2042
03:03:57,360 --> 03:03:59,360
Seriously, like somebody's you're just gonna get grabbed

2043
03:04:00,079 --> 03:04:04,159
That move is when there's two of them doing it. This is no way. There's no way

2044
03:04:04,879 --> 03:04:08,000
I dodged something it felt like I felt like I avoided

2045
03:04:08,639 --> 03:04:12,479
Something it feels like they both do it but one of them is staggered a little bit

2046
03:04:12,559 --> 03:04:17,040
So it's like grab grab and it's just hands everywhere. I rolled into like the second one

2047
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:21,670
I felt like it's like six to eight of them

2048
03:04:23,329 --> 03:04:28,530
Shit, can you block that with a shield if you just hold the shield up?

2049
03:04:29,219 --> 03:04:32,610
Can you just like oh or will he just grab you? There's no way

2050
03:04:38,129 --> 03:05:06,979
No, where did this yeti come from? I don't know. Okay

2051
03:05:28,370 --> 03:05:33,170
How do you how do you get away from you can jump those? Can you I thought I tried it last time

2052
03:05:34,799 --> 03:05:37,159
I think so, but you just have to like

2053
03:05:37,159 --> 03:05:40,159
Not get hit, you know

2054
03:05:40,159 --> 03:05:57,700
True god

2055
03:05:57,700 --> 03:06:00,979
Where the hell am I? What am I? Where am I? What's going on with me? Where is he?

2056
03:06:01,299 --> 03:06:04,899
Yeah, what's that was weird? What the fuck? He looked like he's picked you up

2057
03:06:06,500 --> 03:06:08,500
No, he's he's

2058
03:06:08,899 --> 03:06:10,899
In the corner. Oh, this is not good

2059
03:06:15,649 --> 03:06:18,450
We should probably just get out let him teleport. I'm walking away

2060
03:06:20,690 --> 03:06:22,850
This is the astle fight where you want to zone him

2061
03:06:35,809 --> 03:06:42,790
I thought something just broke through the ceiling. It was his fucking leg. What are the hell is stinger?

2062
03:06:43,590 --> 03:06:59,540
It really was a good second there. I was like, when did he get like magma attacks?

2063
03:07:00,340 --> 03:07:11,399
That meteor shit it shoots in front of them

2064
03:07:11,399 --> 03:07:16,280
That's why we're not gonna hit because it's like all target in front of them and we're like so like locked into these corners behind him

2065
03:07:17,079 --> 03:07:18,680
You cannot jump that

2066
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:22,280
I think you just have to dodge through it. I wonder there's a trick to it

2067
03:07:23,159 --> 03:07:31,840
What's the you just have to run away from it. You can't dodge it at all. Okay

2068
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:36,450
You definitely dodge it but like

2069
03:07:36,690 --> 03:07:38,690
It has to be one of the last ones

2070
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:46,559
He's gonna turn into like seven guys in a second. He's gonna do some five guys shit

2071
03:07:48,659 --> 03:07:50,659
Would stop doing this move

2072
03:07:50,899 --> 03:08:01,479
Why does he keep?

2073
03:08:01,479 --> 03:08:03,479
Make sure you're full health. Whoa

2074
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:10,600
Oh my god, there's a hundred of them. We thought there were two it's like 30. It's like 10

2075
03:08:12,440 --> 03:08:14,440
We didn't get him on the first sweep boys

2076
03:08:18,770 --> 03:08:20,770
What moves are happening?

2077
03:08:24,879 --> 03:08:36,209
Oh my god

2078
03:08:36,209 --> 03:08:37,090
Die

2079
03:08:37,090 --> 03:08:39,639
Okay, he's dead

2080
03:08:39,639 --> 03:08:41,239
Nice. Yeah

2081
03:08:41,239 --> 03:08:45,139
Oh my goodness

2082
03:08:45,139 --> 03:08:48,899
That he that was like seven people eight people no wonder

2083
03:08:49,860 --> 03:08:51,860
No wonder we were getting grabbed every time

2084
03:08:54,629 --> 03:09:00,069
Got some scrambled eggs. Maybe we own dragon hot. There are five worms. That's so bad

2085
03:09:18,610 --> 03:09:20,690
Oh, I need a lot more souls. I thought I did there we go

2086
03:09:21,569 --> 03:09:22,370
30

2087
03:09:22,370 --> 03:09:24,370
Uh 30 hp 30 bigger

2088
03:09:25,250 --> 03:09:27,250
And now stop leveling that

2089
03:09:27,489 --> 03:09:36,639
Cool. I got a pot wagons. Love me

2090
03:09:38,870 --> 03:09:41,510
You know the other dragon altar like way in the beginning

2091
03:09:42,389 --> 03:09:44,709
Mm-hmm. I feel like we should go there because

2092
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:47,920
They seem to have really good items in it

2093
03:09:48,079 --> 03:09:50,659
We can do that

2094
03:09:50,659 --> 03:09:53,139
I thought this opened after you killed them. Is there something else?

2095
03:09:54,760 --> 03:09:56,920
I thought that was a seal. Maybe not

2096
03:10:00,680 --> 03:10:02,120
Maybe I missed

2097
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:11,030
I don't know. Is it a seal chat? It's it there's a seal right? There's one more tower

2098
03:10:11,510 --> 03:10:38,309
Which one this one over here?

2099
03:10:38,309 --> 03:10:40,629
Yeah, i'm trying the same thing over on the other side

2100
03:10:41,350 --> 03:10:45,030
I just do I don't want to do it the right way. I want to do it like the dumb cheesy way

2101
03:10:45,510 --> 03:10:47,829
I forget where the right way is

2102
03:10:52,899 --> 03:10:53,620
Oh

2103
03:10:53,620 --> 03:11:01,079
Oh, I got it

2104
03:11:01,079 --> 03:11:29,430
All right. Which one do we need up here? There's the ladder. I believe in you. I'm just riding around. Yeah, there is this one here

2105
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:38,319
I thought I did all of them

2106
03:11:40,399 --> 03:11:45,040
They can get I mean it's it's pretty same. It's pretty like samey out here

2107
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:46,479
so

2108
03:11:46,479 --> 03:11:49,040
Uh, I mean like I was saying I did some of them yesterday

2109
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,680
I like randomly was in the swamp and you weren't here

2110
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:56,079
So, I don't know maybe it didn't save one of them, but I was pretty sure I did

2111
03:11:56,639 --> 03:12:00,000
One and we just did two and I think you only need three. I think it's three

2112
03:12:00,559 --> 03:12:25,940
Let's continue. I'm gonna rest for a second. Well, that was you

2113
03:12:34,899 --> 03:12:36,950
ball

2114
03:12:36,950 --> 03:12:39,190
That ball was very aggressive

2115
03:12:39,989 --> 03:12:44,850
And very angry

2116
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:54,440
Gave them the ball call

2117
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:56,360
Oh, it's blood

2118
03:12:56,360 --> 03:13:07,090
I'm just going up to the church

2119
03:13:07,090 --> 03:13:16,450
Mm-hmm somber stone miner's bell

2120
03:13:18,260 --> 03:13:27,569
Really? I feel like I that's probably the first two. It won't actually be somber stones. Oh really? That's right. Shit

2121
03:13:30,559 --> 03:13:39,239
What the fuck are you doing buddy?

2122
03:13:39,239 --> 03:13:41,239
We're gonna kill it. We're gonna kill that girl

2123
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:44,159
No, okay

2124
03:13:44,159 --> 03:13:49,760
I thought we were kind of like just accidentally just fire. Just kill her. I know there's the cave straight up here

2125
03:13:50,659 --> 03:13:53,540
They're like hidden illusory wall. I know you're one

2126
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:56,100
Yeah special

2127
03:13:56,100 --> 03:14:02,950
This one is this one sucks

2128
03:14:03,250 --> 03:14:06,709
Unendurable frenzy. I have a frenzy move. What the fuck is that?

2129
03:14:07,350 --> 03:14:09,350
Regal omen bairn

2130
03:14:11,079 --> 03:14:18,469
The hell is that I want to do a frenzy build if we wanted to do that

2131
03:14:20,040 --> 03:14:22,850
uh

2132
03:14:22,850 --> 03:14:25,670
What frenzy build it's where about it?

2133
03:14:26,229 --> 03:14:30,790
Yeah, I I tried it once with the vikes pike and all like the crazy like

2134
03:14:31,590 --> 03:14:41,430
With the eyes the spells is he pretending to know what i'm talking about. I know what you're talking about

2135
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:50,389
Shabiri's whoa and shabiri. Yes. Yeah, you don't oh, I I know it. I don't um

2136
03:14:51,110 --> 03:15:03,319
Okay, so let me take a look at the map. I'll be really honest with you. You completely missed

2137
03:15:03,799 --> 03:15:05,799
I'm gonna be really honest with you. Mm-hmm

2138
03:15:08,610 --> 03:15:09,649
we've

2139
03:15:09,649 --> 03:15:13,409
Done a lot. I'm surprised. We've actually done this much on randomizer

2140
03:15:15,520 --> 03:15:30,340
Yeah, i've been once you get the gear and you just go to the places and kill the guys. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Uh-oh

2141
03:15:31,270 --> 03:15:37,889
Lag whoa. All right. My game does not want me to look over to the left for some reason. Yeah, my game is freaking out

2142
03:15:38,530 --> 03:15:41,440
Where'd my health go?

2143
03:15:41,440 --> 03:15:43,840
You only had half health when we came up here. I did

2144
03:15:44,719 --> 03:15:48,159
I think from the wolf, but you never like healed after that. Yeah

2145
03:15:48,959 --> 03:15:53,280
Oh, yeah, I i'm lagging so fast. Yeah, don't do not look that way

2146
03:15:53,920 --> 03:15:56,639
Something oh there's something that's spawned in over there. That's just not

2147
03:15:57,360 --> 03:16:00,659
The game does not like it

2148
03:16:00,659 --> 03:16:02,659
Yeah, so look at this

2149
03:16:03,250 --> 03:16:04,629
Look at this

2150
03:16:04,629 --> 03:16:12,020
I wonder what it is. What did the game spawn in there? That's making it so horrible. I don't know i'm going in the cave

2151
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:16,399
I'm kind of uh, caving up. I'm kind of curious but whatever

2152
03:16:18,079 --> 03:16:20,559
I don't want to hunt down the thing that's gonna like make us crash

2153
03:16:21,200 --> 03:16:28,559
It's true

2154
03:16:28,559 --> 03:16:30,559
Even in the cave when I look in that direction

2155
03:16:31,860 --> 03:16:33,299
Oh shit. Yeah

2156
03:16:33,299 --> 03:16:42,739
Should we go kill whatever it is? Is it gonna cause a problem? I think that reset whatever it was. No, no

2157
03:16:43,909 --> 03:16:46,709
There is just this is the this is uh, this is our life

2158
03:16:47,590 --> 03:16:49,590
It might maybe it's down here

2159
03:16:52,079 --> 03:16:55,350
maybe oh

2160
03:16:55,510 --> 03:16:59,350
Yeah, maybe like in the boss room. There's like some giant thing that doesn't fit in it

2161
03:16:59,989 --> 03:17:01,989
It's like constantly trying to reset

2162
03:17:03,559 --> 03:17:05,559
Oh my goodness

2163
03:17:05,799 --> 03:17:10,819
Yeah, I don't know. I find that the 30 fps is a little bit more cinematic and you can't really see much better than that

2164
03:17:10,819 --> 03:17:19,510
Anyway, you remember when that was actually a debate I do

2165
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:23,350
Well, here it is. I think is this it

2166
03:17:30,260 --> 03:17:33,219
Just take you through the fucking I went through the ceiling

2167
03:17:37,379 --> 03:17:39,299
I think it is this thing

2168
03:17:39,299 --> 03:17:41,940
This thing is not supposed to be down here. Oh god

2169
03:17:44,719 --> 03:17:47,399
Okay

2170
03:17:47,399 --> 03:17:49,879
when it despawns

2171
03:17:49,879 --> 03:17:54,440
That that was it. That was it. Yeah, that was it the fucking turkey down here was causing a huge problem

2172
03:17:54,840 --> 03:18:01,430
Okay. Well, we we cleared it

2173
03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:04,319
We cleared we cleared the fps boss

2174
03:18:21,350 --> 03:18:23,030
such crap

2175
03:18:23,030 --> 03:18:25,030
Look at look at this fucking garbage

2176
03:18:26,639 --> 03:18:28,069
junk

2177
03:18:28,069 --> 03:18:30,879
Another remembrance

2178
03:18:30,879 --> 03:18:32,959
No, just like all these crystals crap

2179
03:18:34,850 --> 03:18:40,370
Oh like this isn't real like this is a movie set. Is that what I don't I don't know. You don't like crystals

2180
03:18:41,780 --> 03:18:45,540
Making a stupid reference to back when I told you that the crystal spells are all terrible

2181
03:18:46,500 --> 03:18:50,180
Oh

2182
03:18:50,180 --> 03:18:56,770
Did you have a jo crystal?

2183
03:18:56,770 --> 03:18:59,889
Dude, you have a you have a turmeric bracelet. No, I don't

2184
03:19:03,379 --> 03:19:09,379
You mean oh you mean black tourmaline. It's not a turmeric. It's not a turmeric bracelet

2185
03:19:10,020 --> 03:19:13,700
And by the way, I don't have it on anymore. I it's not I

2186
03:19:14,819 --> 03:19:41,239
Do you need it for luck?

2187
03:19:41,239 --> 03:19:42,920
Wait turmeric wait

2188
03:19:42,920 --> 03:19:49,700
Turmeric actually is very good for you. Okay, but like in a bracelet. No, is it there it being goofy over here?

2189
03:19:50,340 --> 03:20:00,840
Okay, it's them starlight star bright shine the way through the dungeon tonight. You stopped wearing it because you got bullied

2190
03:20:11,459 --> 03:20:15,620
Uh-oh, is that a mog like?

2191
03:20:16,579 --> 03:20:21,620
That is not a mog like I I saw the cape and I couldn't really see what it was

2192
03:20:22,340 --> 03:20:26,370
Come on. You don't even know what a mog like is

2193
03:20:27,170 --> 03:20:40,100
No, this thing has the weird timings

2194
03:20:42,200 --> 03:20:48,200
They just do this over and over again

2195
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:53,559
I'm pretty low on flasks already. So i'm hoping that this boss is not like a bird with his head stuck in the ceiling

2196
03:20:54,120 --> 03:21:00,280
I think we've gotten pretty

2197
03:21:00,280 --> 03:21:02,360
decent rolls on these

2198
03:21:02,360 --> 03:21:03,969
it's not like

2199
03:21:03,969 --> 03:21:05,969
Placidics whatever is in here

2200
03:21:16,360 --> 03:21:18,200
He's blowing the horn

2201
03:21:18,200 --> 03:21:21,799
Oh my goodness. This guy just fucking killed me

2202
03:21:22,840 --> 03:21:24,840
No, he didn't I thought he did

2203
03:21:27,270 --> 03:21:32,629
Help help. They're down here. Help someone you're like you're like a thousand feet below the earth, man

2204
03:21:34,319 --> 03:21:43,139
All right. You ready? What do we get? Yep. Okay

2205
03:21:44,100 --> 03:21:53,250
Not that bad. Oh, he's a new player. This is a new player

2206
03:21:56,899 --> 03:21:58,579
No

2207
03:22:00,819 --> 03:22:02,819
Oh and there's no fire on that one

2208
03:22:18,440 --> 03:22:24,520
Not that bad. We've been getting pretty good rolls in these

2209
03:22:25,159 --> 03:22:31,090
There's a lot of souls. I like souls

2210
03:22:32,020 --> 03:22:34,020
That was worth a lot of

2211
03:22:34,100 --> 03:22:37,170
blood echoes

2212
03:22:37,170 --> 03:22:45,299
Runes. Yeah, let's go farm blood vials. It's back. Yeah, it is. It's because that bird is back

2213
03:22:46,549 --> 03:22:51,829
We got to go kill that fucking bird and then come back. Let's teleport out of here. Honestly, let's go somewhere else

2214
03:22:53,350 --> 03:22:57,510
I want to fight radon dude. What do we have to do to fight radon? We have to go sit at a bonfire in

2215
03:22:58,229 --> 03:22:59,799
the plateau

2216
03:22:59,799 --> 03:23:01,799
Teleporting to the church down the hill

2217
03:23:02,360 --> 03:23:07,600
Because walking would be really hard. How do I say? How do I say? Yes, there they go

2218
03:23:08,079 --> 03:23:16,739
It's the best essential oil to cure bronchitis. I don't

2219
03:23:18,790 --> 03:23:27,399
I don't think I take whale oil for anything. What are you talking about? Whale is a great creature

2220
03:23:29,639 --> 03:23:31,639
That's one of the biggest creatures

2221
03:23:35,540 --> 03:23:44,850
Yeah antibiotics. Yeah, am I right? Yes

2222
03:23:49,329 --> 03:23:51,329
Think about it if you want to get big

2223
03:23:53,510 --> 03:23:57,540
Think about it. I'm a barf drinker did this

2224
03:23:58,340 --> 03:24:14,659
Trying to channel his energy right now

2225
03:24:14,659 --> 03:24:16,420
I'm exiting the area

2226
03:24:16,420 --> 03:24:18,420
Where where do you want to go from here?

2227
03:24:18,819 --> 03:24:22,290
I forget what's on the top though this hill

2228
03:24:25,959 --> 03:24:27,879
Need an inhaler

2229
03:24:27,879 --> 03:24:30,440
But bronchitis is I don't know

2230
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:43,280
I'm not a fucking doctor. I don't know

2231
03:24:43,280 --> 03:24:45,040
Is there anything at all up here?

2232
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:49,909
It was just a question

2233
03:24:50,229 --> 03:24:56,920
Let me tell you something about blenders first of all

2234
03:24:57,860 --> 03:25:00,680
Oh shit, we got a mog like

2235
03:25:00,680 --> 03:25:10,309
Yeah, I think you actually might be accurate. That's a mog like enemy, isn't it? Nope. It's a cool weapon though

2236
03:25:10,790 --> 03:25:20,920
Uh, this is actually gonna be hard. So just we gotta like I don't think they can come out

2237
03:25:23,600 --> 03:25:25,600
Ooh, that's good. Whatever that that's

2238
03:25:26,629 --> 03:25:28,629
I don't think i've ever seen this enemy

2239
03:25:29,889 --> 03:25:31,090
Yeah, you have

2240
03:25:31,090 --> 03:25:33,250
Down in the giant area when you go across the big chain

2241
03:25:35,170 --> 03:25:39,489
You mean where you just like ignore that whole area and run with your horse and just go up to the the giant

2242
03:25:40,579 --> 03:25:41,780
what

2243
03:25:41,780 --> 03:25:43,780
Did you stream a lot of your elder ring?

2244
03:25:44,659 --> 03:25:45,620
Yeah

2245
03:25:45,620 --> 03:25:47,860
What level were you when you got to like?

2246
03:25:48,180 --> 03:25:51,139
The giant area like what I wonder what level you were

2247
03:25:53,479 --> 03:26:11,590
Oh

2248
03:26:11,590 --> 03:26:15,590
You mean the place where you just get on your horse and just ride by everything. Yo

2249
03:26:17,430 --> 03:26:21,590
Item item item alert item alert item alert item alert item alert

2250
03:26:22,389 --> 03:26:23,750
somber five

2251
03:26:23,750 --> 03:26:25,750
Are you ready to go beyond?

2252
03:26:26,149 --> 03:26:30,180
Or do you not need that anymore? Give it to me

2253
03:26:30,420 --> 03:26:41,239
Do you have a six? I have a seven and an ancient

2254
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:45,159
I have a four a seven and a nine

2255
03:26:45,879 --> 03:26:47,879
So that will help appreciate it. Thank you

2256
03:26:58,229 --> 03:27:00,790
Number go big big plus one level

2257
03:27:01,510 --> 03:27:05,750
Uh with somber, that's a big deal. That's ten percent. That is there's only ten levels

2258
03:27:06,309 --> 03:27:11,110
That's that is a full one out of ten, which is ten percent. Come on

2259
03:27:11,829 --> 03:27:17,829
It's gonna be more than ten percent. I have I have never been over here

2260
03:27:19,299 --> 03:27:21,219
I've never gone through there

2261
03:27:21,219 --> 03:27:25,700
I've never been up here. I've never been to this tower. Have I even played this game?

2262
03:27:26,180 --> 03:27:30,260
I'm starting to wonder maybe I didn't play this game. So when you

2263
03:27:30,819 --> 03:27:34,760
Did you play anything off stream too? Just kind of like in your own free time?

2264
03:27:35,319 --> 03:27:37,270
I think so. Yeah

2265
03:27:37,270 --> 03:27:38,629
You didn't do the thing where it's like oh

2266
03:27:38,629 --> 03:27:43,110
I want to see what this is and just go go over there in every single zone. Just kind of what's this

2267
03:27:44,469 --> 03:27:46,069
It's a big game

2268
03:27:46,069 --> 03:27:52,639
Yeah, but I you I feel like you missed you could just probably play this again and just see it. Sorry that you're mad

2269
03:27:53,620 --> 03:27:56,420
Yeah, we're very upset with you for not knowing where everything is

2270
03:27:57,959 --> 03:28:01,479
We're very upset. Okay. Well, wait, what is usually here because we came all the way up here

2271
03:28:01,479 --> 03:28:04,159
There's like nothing here. Just

2272
03:28:04,479 --> 03:28:10,079
Very upset with you that you didn't 100% and get every achievement. It's just it's like unfortunate that I even know you

2273
03:28:10,639 --> 03:28:14,229
How many hours do you have an elden ring?

2274
03:28:15,860 --> 03:28:18,340
On the game. Actually, I don't know. That's a good question

2275
03:28:20,840 --> 03:28:23,959
Probably not that much considering I did

2276
03:28:25,639 --> 03:28:27,639
I wanted to play it on my couch

2277
03:28:28,719 --> 03:28:31,280
So I got it on xbox

2278
03:28:32,680 --> 03:28:36,879
Okay, so you so you own like seven copies of the game get out of the way

2279
03:28:37,909 --> 03:28:48,479
There's an item on the ground. Can I pick it up? Thanks. I have a series s

2280
03:28:52,870 --> 03:28:55,270
Series s is uh, I love that little thing

2281
03:28:58,049 --> 03:29:01,569
Well, I think usually you gotta come up here because you gotta kill the guy who throws the pots down on the road

2282
03:29:03,250 --> 03:29:08,469
That's about it. I mean, you don't even gotta I want to fight radon

2283
03:29:12,639 --> 03:29:14,479
Jerma, take the wheel

2284
03:29:14,479 --> 03:29:17,280
Make it happen. Okay, we need to go to the plateau

2285
03:29:20,600 --> 03:29:24,680
So we're jumping off but we've got a series x I don't didn't really have a need for it

2286
03:29:27,700 --> 03:29:31,559
series x, um

2287
03:29:31,559 --> 03:29:33,719
It's I mean I I have a pc

2288
03:29:34,200 --> 03:29:37,799
So if I anything that comes out in the series x I would just get it here

2289
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:44,549
I don't have a ps5. Do you have ps5?

2290
03:29:45,780 --> 03:29:51,250
Nope, do you have any of the current gen consoles or no you have a switch? Don't you?

2291
03:29:51,569 --> 03:29:58,290
I have a ps4 and they still release like every fighting game on that thing. I thought you had a switch though

2292
03:29:58,290 --> 03:30:04,370
Didn't you know I have a switch. Yeah, I've never used it. Is this sealed in the box?

2293
03:30:04,930 --> 03:30:07,559
No, uh, it's a wife device

2294
03:30:07,559 --> 03:30:08,680
Dude if it was sealed in the box

2295
03:30:08,680 --> 03:30:13,479
I would say keep it in the box and seal it because then you know that you got it like an heirloom plays like fire emblem

2296
03:30:13,799 --> 03:30:14,760
and

2297
03:30:14,760 --> 03:30:21,430
Zelda and all that breath of the wild is pretty fun. You never played it. I tried it on like a flight

2298
03:30:21,510 --> 03:30:25,909
I was like i'll take the switch like play it on the plane. Wait, wait, wait star star

2299
03:30:26,870 --> 03:30:32,979
Hold on be careful. I'm gonna stop you because you're about to have a lot of people

2300
03:30:33,559 --> 03:30:35,959
Very you're gonna get a you're gonna get a stir l here

2301
03:30:36,040 --> 03:30:41,079
I was saying earlier like me and you disagree on like everything you liked breath of the wild a lot

2302
03:30:43,430 --> 03:30:46,389
Okay, i'm just telling you just be careful with this next statement

2303
03:30:46,950 --> 03:30:53,459
It's gonna be a doozy guys. Be ready. Um, my opinion is that

2304
03:30:55,540 --> 03:31:00,979
Legend of zelda breath of the wild was ign's number one greatest game of all time

2305
03:31:01,750 --> 03:31:03,909
Is number one on their list. That's my opinion

2306
03:31:04,930 --> 03:31:12,530
You take all of the video games ever made and the best game of all time is on the switch and it's breath of the wild

2307
03:31:16,100 --> 03:31:17,379
Yeah, I disagree with that

2308
03:31:17,379 --> 03:31:22,239
I disagree with that good because that list was fucking ridiculous

2309
03:31:22,319 --> 03:31:26,479
Every blizzard game was all in like the same like it was like starcraft warcraft

2310
03:31:26,559 --> 03:31:28,479
Like they just like I don't put all the blizzard games here

2311
03:31:32,739 --> 03:31:39,159
I mean, I I don't I don't think that breath of wild is the best video game ever made. I think it's game crash

2312
03:31:39,639 --> 03:31:41,319
Oh

2313
03:31:41,319 --> 03:31:44,280
I want to fight. We're done. Yes, let's go up to the plateau

2314
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:48,000
Um, I think I think it's really good. I think it's really fun

2315
03:31:49,940 --> 03:31:57,750
If you like elden ring, it's just kind of elden ring with cartoon graphics. I didn't give it enough time

2316
03:31:58,389 --> 03:32:00,549
and the breaking items

2317
03:32:01,110 --> 03:32:02,950
And stuff, I don't know

2318
03:32:02,950 --> 03:32:07,649
That rubs me the wrong way, but I definitely haven't given it enough time to even have any opinion

2319
03:32:07,729 --> 03:32:09,729
I legitimately got to the first dungeon

2320
03:32:09,889 --> 03:32:17,030
And then just didn't feel like playing the game I didn't like not like it

2321
03:32:17,270 --> 03:32:21,680
I think it's fun. I mean i've been streaming it not lately, but I think it's a good game

2322
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:31,719
I have one major complaint about elden ring and it's it's kind of unfair because I bloodborne is like my number one

2323
03:32:32,040 --> 03:32:38,479
probably number two whatever favorite game ever made breath of the wild even on the switch sometimes runs it like

2324
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:46,629
Like 18 frames a second. I opened the world to you. That's the only complaint I really have about it

2325
03:32:56,850 --> 03:32:59,409
You didn't your first time playing it was on stream, right?

2326
03:32:59,649 --> 03:33:05,540
I almost feel like I would I would need to be streaming it to play it

2327
03:33:07,319 --> 03:33:11,799
Like just sitting around to play breath of the wild was like, I don't know. I feel like it's so big

2328
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:18,469
There's so much shit going on and I got to collect all these these peaches. I was like, I don't know

2329
03:33:18,790 --> 03:33:23,110
But it's a pretty good streaming because then I have to set up like a whole like twitch in my

2330
03:33:23,750 --> 03:33:29,250
The switch in my room and get like all the cables and that's just who's got time for that. Yeah

2331
03:33:29,649 --> 03:33:36,870
It is a pretty good stream game though. It's a chill game just to kind of just turn it on and play for a little while

2332
03:33:38,719 --> 03:33:44,399
Yeah, but they're like I would have to plug in like two cables. All right, so we are we're we do we should not be here

2333
03:33:45,479 --> 03:33:49,959
We need to go up to we need to go to the church though. We need to go to the plateau

2334
03:33:50,280 --> 03:33:56,690
I think once we get to the plateau, I think we have a cut scene. I'm I'm following you

2335
03:33:57,629 --> 03:33:59,010
100% okay

2336
03:33:59,010 --> 03:34:01,569
Let me uh, let me make sure I have this right

2337
03:34:01,969 --> 03:34:03,409
We have to get to the plateau

2338
03:34:03,409 --> 03:34:08,290
We get a cut scene when we go to the plateau and then it's like, okay, here we go radan's available, right?

2339
03:34:08,450 --> 03:34:16,280
That's correct. My chat says please just walk over the bridge

2340
03:34:17,909 --> 03:34:22,309
Those ballistas might not be manned because of the uh randomizer. That's also very true

2341
03:34:25,989 --> 03:34:27,270
Just go

2342
03:34:27,270 --> 03:34:29,110
Just go

2343
03:34:29,110 --> 03:34:32,149
No, that's part of that's part of ronnie's quest. Oh

2344
03:34:33,030 --> 03:34:43,329
Let's go to the bridges fucking walk. We have to talk to ronnie. We need a medallion for the bridge. Oh

2345
03:34:46,719 --> 03:34:51,360
Oh, yeah, and you like like normally I think the medallions in a spot where you just kind of like always get it

2346
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:53,889
So I didn't really think about it much

2347
03:34:53,969 --> 03:34:57,559
But now we don't you get the two halves at the forts

2348
03:34:58,840 --> 03:35:06,639
Uh, let me level up first because I don't want if we just get bombarded with missiles. I don't want to get behind me soldier

2349
03:35:10,120 --> 03:35:13,719
Shit, we need to kill like one thing. Hold on. Let me kill like random thing over here

2350
03:35:14,840 --> 03:35:16,840
I can give you a rune

2351
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:18,840
Yeah

2352
03:35:18,840 --> 03:35:27,799
Faster. I don't is that gonna do it?

2353
03:35:28,520 --> 03:35:33,090
Is that enough? I don't think that's enough

2354
03:35:33,649 --> 03:35:40,979
I can like give you another rune. You just keep arming me for runes. I need like another just give me I need like 800

2355
03:35:44,100 --> 03:35:45,780
You can get to the

2356
03:35:45,780 --> 03:35:52,440
You can either you activate the festival either by doing ronnie's quest line or activating any bonfire at

2357
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:58,440
Atlas altis plateau. I think the fest the festival is active. It was just that we didn't have the medallion

2358
03:35:59,319 --> 03:36:05,590
to teleport

2359
03:36:05,590 --> 03:36:09,190
Uh, we let's try to do it this way and if we need ronnie's quest line. I have

2360
03:36:09,989 --> 03:36:12,469
I have I have two of the items for it. I think

2361
03:36:13,030 --> 03:36:15,030
Go over the bridge. Yeah, that's probably

2362
03:36:15,889 --> 03:36:24,930
I'm gonna blast

2363
03:36:24,930 --> 03:36:26,930
Okay

2364
03:36:29,729 --> 03:36:33,969
Yeah, there's just there's just like a pimple where the ballista would be

2365
03:36:35,489 --> 03:36:37,489
I I don't know why I didn't just try it

2366
03:36:38,209 --> 03:36:40,770
Yeah, we we kind of didn't trust this somehow

2367
03:36:41,940 --> 03:36:44,579
I don't know why we didn't trust that. This was gonna be easy

2368
03:36:46,500 --> 03:36:51,040
That was rough. Oh look a dragon

2369
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:53,680
What the fuck

2370
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:57,360
That was planned

2371
03:36:57,360 --> 03:37:01,760
They planned that oh my god the ambush. All right. Yeah, we just go don't even fight this

2372
03:37:05,239 --> 03:37:07,239
I'm glad you got a 3d movie, too

2373
03:37:08,579 --> 03:37:10,579
That had to have been right in your face, right?

2374
03:37:10,579 --> 03:37:13,940
Yeah, that was uh

2375
03:37:13,940 --> 03:37:15,940
I had the 3d glasses on and everything

2376
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:29,190
You know, what's crazy?

2377
03:37:29,190 --> 03:37:35,590
3d like 3d glasses 3d movie 3d video game stuff really just fucking disintegrated, didn't it?

2378
03:37:36,149 --> 03:37:38,469
Dude, I was at uh, I was at the arcade the other day

2379
03:37:38,469 --> 03:37:41,350
I was telling you and they have a whole bunch of like vr stuff like oh

2380
03:37:41,350 --> 03:37:47,430
You can go in like the vr experience the omni room. Mm-hmm. And I was looking at it through the lens of like

2381
03:37:48,309 --> 03:37:50,469
This is this already feels outdated

2382
03:37:52,719 --> 03:37:56,159
This just feels like a weird gimmick like I know in like 10 or 20 years

2383
03:37:56,159 --> 03:37:59,840
that's gonna be like the same thing as the pac-man machine in the corner, but like

2384
03:38:00,559 --> 03:38:04,879
Even just seeing it like all brand new vr like like we have a vibe headset

2385
03:38:05,840 --> 03:38:07,809
Yeah

2386
03:38:07,809 --> 03:38:09,170
I think

2387
03:38:09,170 --> 03:38:13,010
Doctor, I was last you've been to an arc. You went to an arcade recently when you did that thing, right?

2388
03:38:14,399 --> 03:38:19,360
Yeah, like two days ago. Yeah, like on the weekend. I gotta get you a take on this. Did you need a smithing stone four?

2389
03:38:20,319 --> 03:38:22,959
What a smithing stone four I just gone and you need that

2390
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:28,079
I don't know. I need like an eight or something. Have you noticed that?

2391
03:38:28,879 --> 03:38:31,040
all the light gun games at the arcades

2392
03:38:31,840 --> 03:38:36,399
Have stayed in like 2003 like their graphics are terrible

2393
03:38:37,040 --> 03:38:39,760
Yeah, frame rates are always dog shit the mechanic. Oh

2394
03:38:40,319 --> 03:38:42,319
Also, this is let me add

2395
03:38:42,319 --> 03:38:48,000
They have uh, they had like a whole booth where like eight people could go in and play vr and they've got like slippery feet floors

2396
03:38:48,079 --> 03:38:51,920
You actually like run in the games and it's got like foot trackers. Oh, which was also

2397
03:38:52,399 --> 03:38:55,040
There's a little miserable

2398
03:38:55,040 --> 03:39:00,479
That wasn't good. Also, you're just wearing vibe headsets, but they can't license out vibe games

2399
03:39:00,479 --> 03:39:02,479
That I guess they thought it would be cheaper to make their own games

2400
03:39:02,559 --> 03:39:06,209
So it's like that you could play beat saber

2401
03:39:06,209 --> 03:39:12,690
But it was like song master and it was they're all just like super shitty copies of all the games you would want to play

2402
03:39:13,090 --> 03:39:17,120
Oh song master

2403
03:39:22,659 --> 03:39:27,780
I got that's like a great online handle name like the song master

2404
03:39:29,989 --> 03:39:37,670
What is controlling this globe that's an enemy they they're in the mystic river or whatever. Oh they are

2405
03:39:41,489 --> 03:39:43,649
the song master

2406
03:39:43,649 --> 03:39:49,510
Yeah, we played elite force which was the generic military death match

2407
03:39:51,620 --> 03:39:54,420
It took longer to like get us all strapped in than it did to play

2408
03:40:05,940 --> 03:40:07,059
yeah, I

2409
03:40:07,059 --> 03:40:12,819
I'm trying to think of what was it when vr came out is when 3d glasses weren't cool anymore, right?

2410
03:40:13,299 --> 03:40:18,370
I think they weren't cool for a while anymore. And also they call them 4d glasses now

2411
03:40:19,909 --> 03:40:24,629
I remember and this is as I remember going to see I believe it was

2412
03:40:25,030 --> 03:40:27,190
I think it was avatar in theaters

2413
03:40:28,229 --> 03:40:33,590
The avatar like the first one and it was a big deal because it was 3d and you get the 3d glasses

2414
03:40:34,229 --> 03:40:34,950
You're you're right

2415
03:40:34,950 --> 03:40:39,270
So someone I know was saying that they went to go see the new avatar and they're handing out 4d glasses

2416
03:40:39,350 --> 03:40:43,030
Like they rebrand it 3d because it's like oh 3d is kind of lame now

2417
03:40:43,030 --> 03:40:47,030
So we're gonna give them 4d glasses and we were like that doesn't make any freaking sense

2418
03:40:47,190 --> 03:40:52,950
They're like no the fourth dimension is time and avatar takes time to watch. It's a 40. It's like they're not like it's sure

2419
03:40:53,110 --> 03:40:57,110
This room is fucked by the way. I don't think we should even go in here. Look at all this

2420
03:40:58,149 --> 03:41:00,149
They can't even move in here

2421
03:41:01,110 --> 03:41:02,719
um

2422
03:41:02,719 --> 03:41:05,840
The only reason why I bring it up is because I remember it because it's a long movie

2423
03:41:06,479 --> 03:41:12,319
I think halfway through the movie. I just I took the glasses off because I was like I can't fucking stand this anymore

2424
03:41:12,639 --> 03:41:14,799
I like my head hurt. I kind of felt like ill

2425
03:41:15,520 --> 03:41:17,040
And I watched they're rough

2426
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:22,799
I watched like 20 to 30 minutes of it just all fucked up looking and blurry and spaced out weird

2427
03:41:23,540 --> 03:41:28,260
I got up and I went just got like snacks and shit. I think I walked around the lobby for like 10 minutes

2428
03:41:28,979 --> 03:41:31,940
I missed like a portion of the whole middle part of the movie

2429
03:41:32,899 --> 03:41:38,260
And then I kind of went to the bathroom. It had to been at least 10 to 15 minutes that I was not in the seat

2430
03:41:39,430 --> 03:41:42,069
And then I just put the glasses back on

2431
03:41:42,709 --> 03:41:44,870
And off hold on. I don't want to die

2432
03:41:46,399 --> 03:41:51,440
I I in intervals would take the glasses on and off and watched it blurry and then watch it in 3d

2433
03:41:52,840 --> 03:41:55,319
For the rest of like the hour and a half that I was still there

2434
03:42:03,520 --> 03:42:08,149
Do you think I'll I just I only ever used them like one time and I do kind of remember

2435
03:42:08,229 --> 03:42:10,229
It's just like my head and eyes kind of hurt

2436
03:42:11,329 --> 03:42:16,209
Do you think there'll ever be a period where they'll do vr movies with vr headsets in the seats?

2437
03:42:18,440 --> 03:42:21,799
And there'd be something to watch or something to like participate in

2438
03:42:22,280 --> 03:42:25,459
I feel like that's the next step and that's very possible

2439
03:42:25,459 --> 03:42:31,139
I feel like that's some some shit you'd find in like a museum or a zoo like you go into the zoo experience

2440
03:42:31,620 --> 03:42:36,260
And like oh you can like pet the penguins and they're like like, you know vr zoo experience in the zoo

2441
03:42:36,420 --> 03:42:38,020
I'm telling you that's the real thing

2442
03:42:38,020 --> 03:42:41,860
I know it I I feel like i've heard of that before from somewhere avatar 6

2443
03:42:41,860 --> 03:42:44,340
You're going to be able to walk around the movie set while the movie happens

2444
03:42:44,420 --> 03:42:47,969
I'm just telling you that's what's happening

2445
03:42:47,969 --> 03:42:52,770
There's going to be the movie playing and you're going to be able to just be kind of walking around or just looking at stuff

2446
03:42:53,010 --> 03:42:56,959
And this is going to be the movie over here. That actually sounds kind of cool

2447
03:43:01,889 --> 03:43:05,170
Hopefully in that future you go to the theater you sit down

2448
03:43:05,959 --> 03:43:11,659
And then like an anesthesiologist comes over and injects lsd into your fucking jugular

2449
03:43:12,850 --> 03:43:15,170
And instead of watching a movie you all just trip together

2450
03:43:16,129 --> 03:43:19,809
What's the point of being what's the point of the movie and then on the movie screen?

2451
03:43:21,010 --> 03:43:23,010
The hypno toad from futurama

2452
03:43:23,569 --> 03:43:24,930
so you say

2453
03:43:24,930 --> 03:43:26,290
what's the

2454
03:43:26,290 --> 03:43:30,049
I don't know how to respond to this

2455
03:43:30,370 --> 03:43:32,370
Instead of everybody in a chair

2456
03:43:32,690 --> 03:43:34,690
It's like because it's just an experience

2457
03:43:35,590 --> 03:43:38,629
That would be a terrible experience because you oh, yeah all like

2458
03:43:39,430 --> 03:43:44,069
You want a room full of like 50 to 100 people all doing lsd. How many of them are standing up?

2459
03:43:44,870 --> 03:43:47,989
And like walking around the aisles and shit like I don't want to do i'm not in that

2460
03:43:47,989 --> 03:43:53,110
I don't I don't want to be in that fucking movie theater. You're oh you get strapped in what?

2461
03:43:53,670 --> 03:43:55,670
Get strapped into the chair

2462
03:43:55,909 --> 03:43:57,909
I'm not going to this movie

2463
03:44:01,430 --> 03:44:04,549
Nope they're a professional. Nope. Nope

2464
03:44:06,870 --> 03:44:08,979
Uh-uh

2465
03:44:08,979 --> 03:44:12,020
I like my vr you walk around like the set that

2466
03:44:12,659 --> 03:44:17,399
james cameron made

2467
03:44:17,399 --> 03:44:23,350
It's torture. That's weird

2468
03:44:23,350 --> 03:44:26,709
But shoot would you be able to be heard and seen by other people?

2469
03:44:27,510 --> 03:44:33,520
I think imagine like a big vr chat lobby just like all yelling shit and screaming at each other

2470
03:44:33,520 --> 03:44:36,959
Well, there's two actors just talking and the movie's going on

2471
03:44:38,079 --> 03:44:49,319
But that would be hell proof earmuffs on you stir. You're describing a clockwork orange

2472
03:44:51,090 --> 03:44:53,409
Oh my god, it's a good movie

2473
03:44:54,209 --> 03:44:58,600
Holy shit. Oh my god

2474
03:44:59,159 --> 03:45:04,600
All right. So we're kind of we're doing the minecraft build the wall take the wall down build the wall

2475
03:45:05,000 --> 03:45:09,559
Take the wall down build the wall. What do you mean? We haven't made any progress. We need to let's go

2476
03:45:09,959 --> 03:45:14,200
We're killing a lot of things. I got a lot of loot. Uh, we go we're going this way, right?

2477
03:45:14,760 --> 03:45:17,079
This is it's this way. We just go up here the stairs

2478
03:45:17,969 --> 03:45:19,559
And that's where it is

2479
03:45:19,559 --> 03:45:24,920
It's in like a hallway. No, i'm telling you right now to your face where it is. We gotta go this way

2480
03:45:25,559 --> 03:45:28,360
Where are you going? Where are you? There's an item up here that you

2481
03:45:29,079 --> 03:45:32,579
Didn't get I did I did though

2482
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:37,840
And there's the mega slime

2483
03:45:37,840 --> 03:45:39,840
Watch out for the mega slime. Oh

2484
03:45:45,860 --> 03:45:47,219
I don't have any mana

2485
03:45:47,219 --> 03:45:59,360
That's sad

2486
03:45:59,360 --> 03:46:03,760
If they ever did that let's say there was like avatar 6 was like you everyone could put the vr headset on and kind of walk

2487
03:46:03,840 --> 03:46:06,799
Around while the movie was playing out in like a 3d space around everybody

2488
03:46:07,829 --> 03:46:10,870
They definitely would just make it so you couldn't you had to have like the avatar

2489
03:46:11,670 --> 03:46:13,989
Everyone had to would have to probably have to be an avatar, right?

2490
03:46:14,229 --> 03:46:15,510
You'd have to be oh

2491
03:46:15,510 --> 03:46:19,030
So you would get the you would get the point of view of the protagonist

2492
03:46:19,110 --> 03:46:23,750
No, no, no, no would be like a side npc and we would all have different points of view and then like when the characters are

2493
03:46:23,750 --> 03:46:30,239
Talking it's like i'm talking to you, but you're like jack naley or whatever his name was and then like we kiss

2494
03:46:30,719 --> 03:46:32,719
No

2495
03:46:32,799 --> 03:46:34,799
I'm talking about watch out

2496
03:46:35,639 --> 03:46:36,840
bad guy

2497
03:46:36,920 --> 03:46:44,100
I need to what I got scarlet rodditt i'm talking about the movie is just

2498
03:46:44,739 --> 03:46:49,860
In 3d space the movie is being is playing and you are just in that space

2499
03:46:50,500 --> 03:46:54,500
You you cannot interact you just can be in the space and see like the crazy shit

2500
03:46:55,700 --> 03:46:57,459
You can walk around in it

2501
03:46:57,459 --> 03:47:01,780
If somebody's talking this looks like let's say you got let's say you get tom hanks over here and he's talking to

2502
03:47:02,500 --> 03:47:04,500
Um, who else is an avatar?

2503
03:47:04,500 --> 03:47:10,739
Uh, whatever so you got tom hanks is an avatar probably so this you got tom hanks and there's another person talking

2504
03:47:11,379 --> 03:47:12,180
and

2505
03:47:12,180 --> 03:47:16,420
You can just literally leave the room and just go look around like the world of avatar

2506
03:47:17,670 --> 03:47:23,040
And you don't you can just do whatever you want. Oh, so you're saying like the movie scene is happening in this room

2507
03:47:23,360 --> 03:47:25,920
But you can just leave the room and look at like an empty field

2508
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:29,040
While like the the cinematic is going on and you're like not even present

2509
03:47:29,200 --> 03:47:32,799
Can you imagine how different that movie would be from multiple different crazy places?

2510
03:47:32,799 --> 03:47:35,600
You can watch from if there was a big battle imagine just being like no

2511
03:47:35,680 --> 03:47:39,520
I'm just gonna go on like the roof of this random building and just watch the battle from there this time

2512
03:47:40,399 --> 03:47:42,639
Oh, I yeah, I can imagine being in the movie

2513
03:47:43,840 --> 03:47:48,319
Of a big battle an immersive experience of you in like the traumatic war movie

2514
03:47:49,200 --> 03:47:55,040
Like the avatars are all getting bombed or something. Oh, no my like urn tree's burning whatever their shit is

2515
03:47:55,840 --> 03:48:01,280
Yeah, that sounds like that sounds way better than my idea of like putting people on lsd and strapping them in

2516
03:48:04,530 --> 03:48:06,530
Hold on out of the spot

2517
03:48:07,440 --> 03:48:12,290
I'm in trouble here

2518
03:48:12,290 --> 03:48:15,649
I like stirr's plan. No, you don't stop

2519
03:48:17,360 --> 03:48:20,399
That's weird because my plan was not spoken to be liked

2520
03:48:21,600 --> 03:48:24,639
That's weird that you like yeah. Oh man, that sounds pretty good

2521
03:48:25,120 --> 03:48:29,120
You mean I got to take lsd and sit and like freak out at a movie theater

2522
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:32,739
Sign me up

2523
03:48:32,739 --> 03:48:33,940
Well, it feels like okay

2524
03:48:33,940 --> 03:48:34,260
Okay

2525
03:48:34,260 --> 03:48:40,020
It feels a little bit the same where like vr is kind of like the new experimental technology like we're just starting to dabble in vr

2526
03:48:40,340 --> 03:48:42,979
Like why not like also like hard drugs?

2527
03:48:45,399 --> 03:48:49,079
but like hard drugs start, you know, they're starting to get like more accepted like uh

2528
03:48:50,040 --> 03:48:53,959
Psychedelics, you know, they're starting to be like, yeah, maybe we should like do some psychedelic research

2529
03:48:54,440 --> 03:48:59,079
You know, they're not like they're not the worst. But wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you in they start doing public?

2530
03:48:59,159 --> 03:49:02,600
Uh, like the public can start getting to the macros to these and we're gonna do like psycho

2531
03:49:03,799 --> 03:49:04,120
All right

2532
03:49:04,120 --> 03:49:11,559
Are you implying are you implying that movies are potentially going to get are getting more boring or kind of lame to a point?

2533
03:49:11,559 --> 03:49:13,559
We're like that's what i'm saying

2534
03:49:14,280 --> 03:49:20,920
You just okay. So let's take movies out of the equation. You're just saying that do drugs in a big group. That's your idea

2535
03:49:21,319 --> 03:49:23,639
That's the idea. That's your idea

2536
03:49:24,120 --> 03:49:26,120
That's just it

2537
03:49:27,959 --> 03:49:29,959
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2538
03:49:30,200 --> 03:49:31,959
All right

2539
03:49:31,959 --> 03:49:33,959
To be clear. I think you got it

2540
03:49:35,159 --> 03:49:39,159
So movies have nothing to do with movies have nothing to do with our conversation at all

2541
03:49:39,719 --> 03:49:44,440
From your from your side here movie theaters, we're just talking about like entertainment that started with like vr

2542
03:49:44,680 --> 03:49:49,159
Okay, the same way that like vr has the goofy like sign up for the vr booth and it's like weird

2543
03:49:49,799 --> 03:49:54,040
Yeah, you'll give it a couple years. It's gonna be like sign up this so we're doing lsd at noon

2544
03:49:55,399 --> 03:49:58,100
I don't think so. I think so

2545
03:50:00,049 --> 03:50:02,229
And you know what?

2546
03:50:02,549 --> 03:50:04,549
That's fine. It's funny. So

2547
03:50:04,950 --> 03:50:10,629
Vr is a thing now my idea is vr kind of evolves a little and we participate in movies

2548
03:50:11,110 --> 03:50:16,309
Your idea is vr fails. Okay, we all do drugs in a room strapped to chairs

2549
03:50:16,870 --> 03:50:18,870
Follow where's the logic?

2550
03:50:19,430 --> 03:50:23,920
I got the logic for you right now. It's it's loaded up. Are you ready? I'm ready

2551
03:50:24,399 --> 03:50:31,360
I'm a billionaire the fight earth is boring. I'm going to buy a rocket ship company and fly to space

2552
03:50:32,319 --> 03:50:33,520
That's happening, right?

2553
03:50:33,520 --> 03:50:38,159
But you also have like a lower level of rich persons like I can't buy my own rocket to space

2554
03:50:38,479 --> 03:50:42,959
I'm gonna go to brazil and find someone to administer ayahuasca to me in the middle of the jungle

2555
03:50:44,020 --> 03:50:51,139
What if we monetize ayahuasca from the jungle and just brought it into the fucking psychotorium and did it like a movie theater?

2556
03:50:53,809 --> 03:50:55,809
I don't even know what I don't know what he's saying

2557
03:50:56,610 --> 03:50:59,329
What he's saying invest invest

2558
03:50:59,329 --> 03:51:01,329
Invest

2559
03:51:01,329 --> 03:51:03,329
Psychotorium coming to your city

2560
03:51:03,969 --> 03:51:05,250
dude

2561
03:51:05,250 --> 03:51:07,809
You're psychotorium me out right now

2562
03:51:09,280 --> 03:51:18,180
Where's the bond? Oh, there's a bonfire

03:51:36,260 --> 03:51:38,260
Of course a lot left unsaid

2570
03:51:39,139 --> 03:51:42,360

2580
03:52:17,409 --> 03:52:24,690
My thing that i'm saying is you taking away the visual just remove the theater part and it's just everyone do drugs together

2581
03:52:24,770 --> 03:52:29,670
There's no theater said that the theater is displaying the futurama

2591
03:53:04,950 --> 03:53:09,139

03:58:04,739 --> 03:58:06,739
Are you on drugs right now?

2644
03:58:07,059 --> 03:58:09,059

2647
03:58:27,430 --> 03:58:31,510
We need we need the medallions but there's that we can go through wait. No, no, no, no, no

2650
03:58:41,440 --> 03:58:44,950

2651
03:58:46,149 --> 03:58:50,309
Main academy gate or can you do no because the bridge is broken. The bridge is broken

2652
03:58:50,389 --> 03:58:52,469
So we need to go all the way up the right or you need to

2653
03:58:56,040 --> 03:58:59,909
Um, I think we actually do have to go up this way

2654
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:08,360
Yeah, I think we have to do the whole right path because everything there is a cliff. The bridge is not broken

2655
03:59:08,360 --> 03:59:10,950
I think we can just go over

2656
03:59:10,950 --> 03:59:32,280
Uh, okay. The bridge is not broken. There's a teleporter on the bridge. Cool. Yeah a movie-length car wash in vr

2657
03:59:32,280 --> 03:59:40,530
Is the future movie-length car wait you go to the car wash and you put it you put a vr headset on

2658
03:59:40,610 --> 03:59:46,209
I feel like entertain you while you're going through the car wash and like while you're going through they're like taking the tires off the car

2659
03:59:48,049 --> 03:59:51,489
You're getting robbed if you do that, by the way, yeah, it's like yeah

2660
03:59:53,569 --> 03:59:55,569
Come to the car cleaner

2661
03:59:55,569 --> 03:59:56,770
Come on in

2662
03:59:56,770 --> 03:59:59,090
You just like sitting there all your shit's gone

2663
03:59:59,889 --> 04:00:03,729
What I was gonna say is all the paint is gonna get stripped off your car

2664
04:00:03,729 --> 04:00:07,809
You guys are gonna be fucked up after that. It's gonna be dense everywhere. All the paint's gonna be gone

2665
04:00:08,469 --> 04:00:10,469
Holy shit, man

2666
04:00:10,469 --> 04:00:14,790
Like a three-hour movie of just your car being washed your car is gonna be fucked up

2667
04:00:15,030 --> 04:00:26,079
Oh, we have the key so we can do this. The stream has gone completely unhinged. Yeah, it has

2668
04:00:27,090 --> 04:00:31,729
Well, don't worry. We'll get back on the road. We will it's inevitable. We always do we always get back on the road

2669
04:00:43,750 --> 04:00:47,379
Yeah, we're getting we're back on the road. We took a wrong exit

2670
04:00:48,020 --> 04:00:51,940
We're calm relaxed. We're done talking about anything

2671
04:00:52,979 --> 04:00:54,180
At all

2672
04:00:54,180 --> 04:01:00,229
It's all been banned

2673
04:01:00,229 --> 04:01:11,649
Do you get an item for this and we just have to go across here and we will activate it night cavalry

2674
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:15,040
Let's actually we probably this pretty easily now

2675
04:01:17,639 --> 04:01:22,260
Yeah, they're like not replaced. That's kind of weird that they're not random. That is weird

2676
04:01:27,680 --> 04:01:32,639
All right. I thought I was you for a second inside of that. I mean it is horse combat

2677
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:42,920
Oh, it does a lot

2678
04:01:42,920 --> 04:01:49,879
I can't there's so much there's so much

2679
04:01:50,680 --> 04:02:01,780
Fire light on the screen. I can't see anything horses up. We've been killing the horse the whole time

2680
04:02:03,459 --> 04:02:14,979
fine once he falls we just gotta we gotta

2681
04:02:15,780 --> 04:02:18,659
Really rip into him rip and tear he's about to fall off

2682
04:02:19,379 --> 04:02:22,049
Or run away

2683
04:02:22,049 --> 04:02:24,049
One of the two all right. He's off

2684
04:02:39,120 --> 04:02:51,319
eat

2685
04:02:51,319 --> 04:02:56,120
The lock on yeah the lock that lock on bug is annoying. I couldn't lock on to him and it got weird

2686
04:03:00,340 --> 04:03:02,659
Yeah, it keeps like dumping it. I keep this like

2687
04:03:18,209 --> 04:03:22,610
There we go

2688
04:03:22,610 --> 04:03:25,719
and

2689
04:03:25,719 --> 04:03:28,280
Oh somber smithing stone, too

2690
04:03:31,090 --> 04:03:34,930
How come stir streams at 1080p 60 fps and you don't because stir

2691
04:03:36,559 --> 04:03:39,059
doesn't understand

2692
04:03:39,059 --> 04:03:41,219
the quality versus bit rate

2693
04:03:41,940 --> 04:03:43,059
thing

2694
04:03:43,059 --> 04:03:44,260
What?

2695
04:03:44,260 --> 04:03:46,069
What do you stream at?

2696
04:03:46,069 --> 04:03:47,989
864

2697
04:03:47,989 --> 04:03:49,989
You stream it like one of the weird numbers, right? Yeah

2698
04:03:50,950 --> 04:03:54,870
Yeah, I did that for a bit and then like my settings reset and I forgot what number I was doing

2699
04:03:54,870 --> 04:03:56,870
So I just went back to like default

2700
04:03:57,590 --> 04:03:58,629
I know

2701
04:03:58,629 --> 04:04:03,510
Stop thinking but yeah, I understand that what germa is doing is correct and you're just trying to find

2702
04:04:05,159 --> 04:04:07,399
Things that aren't correct, but this one is correct

2703
04:04:09,059 --> 04:04:12,879
There you go

2704
04:04:12,879 --> 04:04:18,309
case closed

2705
04:04:18,309 --> 04:04:19,430

Crabtable, uh, the crab is about is is being catapulted. He might act

2709
04:04:29,799 --> 04:04:37,000

04:04:37,959 --> 04:04:41,620
Yeah, he's he didn't make it. He didn't make it

2711
04:04:52,719 --> 04:04:56,479
Oh, uh, I just got urgent heal. Do you want that?

04:05:12,340 --> 04:05:14,340
Is if you go over

2717
04:05:14,579 --> 04:05:16,819
If you go over 6 000 bit rate

2718
04:05:17,989 --> 04:05:19,989
Then I believe

2719
04:05:19,989 --> 04:05:22,629
You are considered to be that's not allowed

2720
04:05:23,190 --> 04:05:28,229
I think that there are some cases maybe where I don't know maybe they allow some maybe events to do it

2721
04:05:28,309 --> 04:05:33,909
I don't know. I have heard of an individual streamer who was like granted the privilege to get like 10k bit rate

2722
04:05:35,219 --> 04:05:37,219
I like a very

2723
04:05:37,799 --> 04:05:38,920
rare

2724
04:05:38,920 --> 04:05:45,159
Thing everything i've ever heard or been told is that anything over 6 000 is considered like against terms of service

2725
04:05:46,120 --> 04:05:50,200
Okay, well I have also heard that but I also used to stream at 8k for quite a while

2726
04:05:50,440 --> 04:05:53,190
I have no idea

2727
04:05:53,190 --> 04:05:57,909
But if for some reason there was ever the ability to oh, hey, no, no, no, no

2728
04:05:57,989 --> 04:06:02,629
Everybody can stream that like up to 20k or up to like 15k. I would do 1080p

2729
04:06:02,950 --> 04:06:06,149
Yeah, I think now it actually

2730
04:06:06,309 --> 04:06:11,989
Like basically gets throttled that it really doesn't let you go above and it used to let you go a little bit above

2731
04:06:12,149 --> 04:06:17,350
I don't know. It's all weird. Where do you use the medallion? Right? Uh, I think it's right here

2732
04:06:17,590 --> 04:06:21,190
I think it's this one. Is this the right lift or did I mislead us?

2733
04:06:24,020 --> 04:06:30,930
Um, this should be I have rolls rolls medallion. Is this not right rolls royce? It's the wrong medallion

2734
04:06:31,250 --> 04:06:36,930
I think chat correct me if i'm wrong. We can go through here. Can we oh, yeah, this is uh, this is the dectus

2735
04:06:37,010 --> 04:06:42,930
I don't I only have the left for dectus. We can go in the tunnel and up right? Yeah. All right. Follow me

2736
04:06:43,680 --> 04:06:50,129
Yeah, I know. I know where we're going. Then you don't have any of the symbols or the I don't think so

2737
04:06:54,309 --> 04:07:20,469
No, I don't have any of them. The one you have is for uh, landell. Hope this doesn't hurt nice smithing stone one

2738
04:07:26,530 --> 04:07:28,899
Stop off that

2739
04:07:30,340 --> 04:07:32,340
No, no, you have you have to go down through the waterway

2740
04:07:32,500 --> 04:07:41,030
Yeah from uh the lake or we could uh, let's go up into the capital. We should

2741
04:07:41,590 --> 04:07:48,959
Kill radan or you mean you mean I I really do want to kill radon. Well, let's just get the bonfire up here

2742
04:07:49,760 --> 04:07:57,860
I guess we could talk to ronnie. What did I just go up?

2743
04:07:58,799 --> 04:08:00,000
Here again

2744
04:08:00,000 --> 04:08:02,479
Do you think you'd yeah, I was gonna ask but whatever

2745
04:08:03,440 --> 04:08:09,719
I'm being a weirdo

2746
04:08:09,719 --> 04:08:14,040
Where do we talk to her? What are we doing? I don't know. I haven't talked to her once this whole playthrough

2747
04:08:14,200 --> 04:08:18,239
So I have no idea where she is now. I think you talked to it. You talked to her first, right?

2748
04:08:19,079 --> 04:08:25,280
And then I don't know where she is now at her, uh her tower. I think she's at the tower like her tower

2749
04:08:25,600 --> 04:08:29,319
Which is here somewhere, right? Isn't it like up here?

2750
04:08:31,409 --> 04:08:36,530
Yeah. Yeah, she has the tower next to

2751
04:08:37,250 --> 04:08:41,540
Her puppet man

2752
04:08:41,540 --> 04:08:49,879
Now I would be her puppet, you know given the chance ronnie will probably take even longer

2753
04:08:51,719 --> 04:08:55,430
Whatever not in any rush or anything

2754
04:09:11,719 --> 04:09:14,360
I am going to request a bathroom pee break

2755
04:09:14,840 --> 04:09:16,600
Uh very soon here though

2756
04:09:16,600 --> 04:09:19,559
Okay, I could really use one of those as well for my bladder pees

2757
04:09:20,440 --> 04:09:56,020
Oh, yeah, you can write the worst up here

2758
04:09:57,299 --> 04:09:59,299
You really shouldn't be able to but

2759
04:09:59,299 --> 04:10:06,420
Should go pee I will after we get this situated

2760
04:10:06,899 --> 04:10:19,110
Jimmy you've spent 19 years sleeping

2761
04:10:23,879 --> 04:10:32,899
What i'm gonna do the math on that. Let's say you sleep six to eight hours a night

2762
04:10:33,219 --> 04:10:36,209
Let's say seven hours average right six seven hours average

2763
04:10:38,159 --> 04:10:54,360
I'm 37 so that's somebody do that math. How many years have I been asleep a third of your whole life?

2764
04:10:54,680 --> 04:10:58,239
How long have I been asleep for 12?

2765
04:10:58,719 --> 04:11:04,159
0.3 years. I've been I was sleep. I've slept for 12.3 years

2766
04:11:04,799 --> 04:11:07,110
I don't like that statistic

2767
04:11:08,719 --> 04:11:14,799
That makes me feel like life is passing by 12 years. I was asleep for 12 years of sleep

2768
04:11:17,190 --> 04:11:18,950
Yeah, wake up

2769
04:11:18,950 --> 04:11:21,340
wake up

2770
04:11:21,340 --> 04:11:29,540
12.3 years asleep. How many years have you spent pissing?

2771
04:11:30,180 --> 04:11:33,219
In that that's another crazy one. Yeah, okay

2772
04:11:34,340 --> 04:11:37,379
Somebody calculate all this you spend 45 minutes in the bathroom

2773
04:11:37,940 --> 04:11:42,340
Every time you go and you go how many times today you're going wait. We need to do this very very

2774
04:11:42,500 --> 04:11:43,700
Wait

2775
04:11:43,700 --> 04:11:46,629
Hold on if it takes let's say it takes me between

2776
04:11:47,659 --> 04:11:52,579
15 to 60 seconds to piss sometimes it's a big one. Let's just say on average

2777
04:11:52,579 --> 04:11:56,260
It's like I I thought we went over this that you spend 40 minutes in the bathroom

2778
04:11:56,340 --> 04:12:01,430
And then but like just hold on peeing only. Oh my god, this is gonna be so scary

2779
04:12:01,829 --> 04:12:07,729
Okay, you guys ready? Let's do it. This is more important than playing the game. I don't care about the game

2780
04:12:07,729 --> 04:12:17,350
Just go you go. I'm talking to the people you are you're doing great if it's about 15 seconds to do a piss, right?

2781
04:12:17,670 --> 04:12:20,709
About 15 maybe 10 to 15. No

2782
04:12:21,190 --> 04:12:28,500
Um, yeah, how many times a day do you pee? I'm a chronic pee counter. No, you could continue

2783
04:12:28,739 --> 04:12:30,739
I was waiting for you to say the rest

2784
04:12:30,819 --> 04:12:31,860
What is that?

2785
04:12:31,860 --> 04:12:34,100
Sometimes when I I don't know when I was young

2786
04:12:34,979 --> 04:12:36,420
Definitely not anymore

2787
04:12:36,420 --> 04:12:40,020
Uh when I know that it's gonna be a real big pee. I'll just count it

2788
04:12:40,340 --> 04:12:44,819
Okay, like how how much pee is this and sometimes, you know, sometimes you hit a minute, dude

2789
04:12:45,059 --> 04:12:47,379
I feel like I pee

2790
04:12:47,459 --> 04:12:52,639
It depends but if i'm talking about an average, let's say it's five I feel like I pee every

2791
04:12:54,440 --> 04:12:59,110
Three to five hours then you also need to you need to

2792
04:12:59,750 --> 04:13:05,280
Factor in the long pees. Yeah, that's what i'm gonna do. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. This needs to be accurate

2793
04:13:05,600 --> 04:13:07,059
so

2794
04:13:07,059 --> 04:13:11,540
If it's let's say you pee every I pee probably every depends on the day

2795
04:13:11,540 --> 04:13:15,059
But like maybe every two to five hours every two three four hours

2796
04:13:15,139 --> 04:13:20,229
Maybe I feel like every couple of hours to four hours

2797
04:13:20,389 --> 04:13:25,760
I'm gonna say three hours average maybe three six nine 12 15 18 21 20

2798
04:13:25,760 --> 04:13:30,790
So let's say let's say I pee seven to ten times a day six to ten times a day

2799
04:13:31,030 --> 04:13:36,120
We're gonna say like seven is that pretty accurate?

2800
04:13:36,360 --> 04:13:42,120
So if I pee seven times a day times like 25 seconds

2801
04:13:42,879 --> 04:13:54,000
So seven times 25 is what that's a lot seven sounds like a lot to me. Is it i'm gonna go pee

2802
04:13:54,639 --> 04:14:01,280
Right now i'm gonna go pee when the stream is over. I mean, I probably also pee a lot

2803
04:14:01,280 --> 04:14:05,780
I've been drinking a lot of water. I've been hydrating. Maybe these people are like I do drink

2804
04:14:05,940 --> 04:14:09,139
I drink a lot of water. I do I drink not I don't want to call it a lot of water

2805
04:14:09,139 --> 04:14:11,809
But I I mean over the course of a day

2806
04:14:11,809 --> 04:14:17,760
I I definitely have at least six to eight ounces of of glasses of water a day

2807
04:14:17,840 --> 04:14:24,079
I have like six to eight eight ounce glasses of water a day. I think it would be fair

2808
04:14:24,239 --> 04:14:29,649
Let's just say let's just say five or six then six

2809
04:14:29,729 --> 04:14:33,489
Let's just say seven seven i'm gonna say seven because I feel like six i'm gonna say six six

2810
04:14:34,229 --> 04:14:42,399
Six times 25 is what seconds? Okay. I think I did the quest and i'm i'm gonna go pee

2811
04:14:42,899 --> 04:14:44,899
All right, you go. We're we're working through this

2812
04:14:45,219 --> 04:14:48,690
Yeah, figure out how long it takes me and then factor that in so it's about

2813
04:14:49,389 --> 04:14:54,979
37 to 47 days is how many how long you've peed a year?

2814
04:14:55,909 --> 04:14:59,670
No, wait, I thought I thought you meant a year that would be fucked up

2815
04:15:00,690 --> 04:15:06,280
So 47 how many how how i'm i'm 37 years old so two and a half minutes a day

2816
04:15:08,309 --> 04:15:17,379
How is that over over 37 years so it would be that so 27 days

2817
04:15:17,700 --> 04:15:34,790
We said I got 27 days. Okay, let's say 27 days and then let's do the other one the

2818
04:15:35,750 --> 04:15:36,469
other

2819
04:15:36,469 --> 04:15:40,450
You know number two I would say uh, probably

2820
04:15:41,510 --> 04:15:45,239
I this is weird to talk about on stream. I'm just gonna call it something else

2821
04:15:45,479 --> 04:15:50,850
I'm gonna combine a few because like I've probably puked a bunch in the bathroom, too

2822
04:15:51,479 --> 04:15:55,079
And so let's do all right how long i'm gonna say a day

2823
04:15:55,719 --> 04:16:00,680
I probably spend about and like showering and like brushing my teeth

2824
04:16:00,680 --> 04:16:08,549
I'm gonna combine everything maybe like 45 minutes to an hour a day

2825
04:16:12,500 --> 04:16:18,309
I would say at least one hour a day is spent cleaning, you know showering

2826
04:16:18,870 --> 04:16:21,590
Brushing my teeth going to the bathroom

2827
04:16:23,409 --> 04:16:30,739
Sometimes they're a little longer probably an hour a day. So one hour a day this 20 so one it's um, 37 years

2828
04:16:31,139 --> 04:16:37,190
Well, how many days is that? You know, i'm saying total across the whole day being in the bathroom. That's it showers

2829
04:16:37,190 --> 04:16:59,040
That's you know, the other thing that i've been said 1.3 years. So it's one and a half years

2830
04:16:59,200 --> 04:17:03,840
So then so let's just let's just round up to the one so one and a half years

2831
04:17:04,000 --> 04:17:09,200
I've been going to the bathroom or showering. I've showered for like a year

2832
04:17:10,799 --> 04:17:12,290
No

2833
04:17:12,290 --> 04:17:14,610
I've been on the toilet for a year and a half

2834
04:17:21,299 --> 04:17:26,959
Jesus plus the other stuff so i've spent like 15 years of my life

2835
04:17:27,520 --> 04:18:12,200
Sleeping brushing my teeth shitting puking or sleeping or taking a shower. I'll be back. Wow

2836
04:18:12,360 --> 04:18:14,549
I was trying I was muted

2837
04:18:14,549 --> 04:18:18,069
I said don't tell me this isn't an interesting conversation because it's a very interesting conversation

2838
04:18:18,149 --> 04:18:20,790
You know how long you've been doing something over the course of your entire life

2839
04:18:20,950 --> 04:18:28,770
It's an interesting conversation and i'm gonna mute you. Okay, because now it's my turn and i'm muting you now

2840
04:18:28,770 --> 04:18:30,770
It's your turn. I don't trust you

2841
04:18:31,170 --> 04:18:36,290
Like while you're gone, I might like say he's gone. Nope. Goodbye. Goodbye. See you later

2842
04:18:36,770 --> 04:22:53,079
All right, i'll be back

2843
04:22:53,239 --> 04:22:59,270
I'm gonna start doing that from now on when I come back. I'm just gonna very gently and lightly just kind of go

2844
04:23:01,120 --> 04:23:03,360
So people go oh he's back instead of being like hey

2845
04:23:07,159 --> 04:23:08,680
What is this title?

2846
04:23:08,680 --> 04:23:10,840
One and a half years in the bathroom

2847
04:23:13,799 --> 04:23:17,639
I didn't make this title

2848
04:23:17,639 --> 04:23:19,889
You still in the bathroom?

2849
04:23:19,889 --> 04:23:24,450
You're telling me you just spent 15 seconds peeing. No, actually I did time it. Did you time yours?

2850
04:23:26,340 --> 04:23:31,540
No, how could you have not timed it when we were just talking about it I really like

2851
04:23:33,540 --> 04:23:36,500
Didn't feel the need to I feel like I have enough data

2852
04:23:37,219 --> 04:23:45,989
I've done the work mine was exactly almost exactly 20 seconds. Okay, that's short

2853
04:23:46,069 --> 04:23:52,799
That's actually very short for how long we've been, you know going you stay hydrated there

2854
04:23:53,379 --> 04:23:55,059
Yeah

2855
04:23:55,059 --> 04:24:02,020
I mean I I did do a big full pee. All right, let's stop this and move on

2856
04:24:03,120 --> 04:24:08,790
Now what's your favorite kind of pasta? Have you ever cut an onion? All right

2857
04:24:09,350 --> 04:24:15,799
We're gonna go to that cave. What cave is that? Because I did the ronnie thing. I think oh wait

2858
04:24:16,120 --> 04:24:21,760
Starts. Oh does it? Well, how can we did you get a cutscene? No, what cutscene are you supposed to get?

2859
04:24:22,319 --> 04:24:28,370
Don't you get a cutscene before radan's there? I know I think we have to I don't know

2860
04:24:28,370 --> 04:24:33,250
I don't I don't remember ever getting a cutscene except for maybe when you go there and they talk about the festival

2861
04:24:33,250 --> 04:24:37,329
Let's warp there. Let's warp there. Let's work there right now right into the the plaza

2862
04:24:37,569 --> 04:25:08,159
Did you count in thousands or mississippi's? Um, just three three four four five five six

2863
04:25:08,950 --> 04:25:11,510
Uh, did it happen usually aren't they usually out here? No

2864
04:25:11,829 --> 04:25:12,149
No

2865
04:25:12,149 --> 04:25:18,180
And we when you gotta go up to altus plateau and we think we can go back down through the river and climb up

2866
04:25:18,260 --> 04:25:20,760
Though that way so what's the best?

2867
04:25:21,680 --> 04:25:23,680
On fire to sit at to do that

2868
04:25:24,079 --> 04:25:31,620
We'd have to start like all the way at that macaria gate and just go down to the left like here

2869
04:25:33,760 --> 04:25:46,000
Let's let's do that. I don't think you can go down here. Yeah, I don't think so. I think we have to go all

2870
04:25:47,280 --> 04:26:06,790
the way

2871
04:26:06,790 --> 04:26:09,090
That way it works

2872
04:26:09,090 --> 04:26:12,370
Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I know a better one. I know a better one. I know a better one

2873
04:26:12,530 --> 04:26:19,079
I know. Yeah, I know a better one

2874
04:26:19,079 --> 04:26:24,899
Well, this is right

2875
04:26:24,899 --> 04:26:26,899
people go down into the lake and

2876
04:26:29,379 --> 04:26:31,379
people are we

2877
04:26:31,459 --> 04:26:35,280
Saying a certain place to go to is it well i'm saying a certain place

2878
04:26:36,879 --> 04:26:41,700
Do you want to go do the turtles?

2879
04:26:41,700 --> 04:26:48,229
All right. So your plan is to go from here and then down and go duck. I see

2880
04:26:49,110 --> 04:26:52,469
Oh, sorry. I left first. I forget sometimes like you load in later

2881
04:26:53,350 --> 04:26:55,350
If yeah, you are the host it is

2882
04:26:55,829 --> 04:26:59,430
I have an extended loading screen more than you do

2883
04:27:00,229 --> 04:27:17,600
You don't want to go pet turtles

2884
04:27:17,600 --> 04:27:21,250
I love how you're the one that wants to pet the turtles

2885
04:27:21,250 --> 04:27:26,930
But you're the one that's been killing the turtles the whole time we've been playing I killed one turtle one too many

2886
04:27:30,200 --> 04:27:35,909
What is zeus?

2887
04:27:35,909 --> 04:27:42,149
Yeah, what is doing that? This area looks weird

2888
04:27:45,090 --> 04:27:47,319
In it

2889
04:27:47,319 --> 04:27:50,639
I went backwards

2890
04:27:50,959 --> 04:27:56,079
You did just go in the complete. Why was I following you? I just assumed you were going the right way

2891
04:27:56,319 --> 04:27:58,319
I was distracted by the zeus

2892
04:27:58,719 --> 04:28:07,430
It was just vibing. Hey, i'll tell you

2893
04:28:08,559 --> 04:28:11,360
Vibes have been vibes have been pretty good tonight. Would you say that?

2894
04:28:12,799 --> 04:28:17,760
I thought the vibes were good yesterday as well enough. You're trying to like compare like you're saying for you

2895
04:28:17,760 --> 04:28:19,760
The vibe was off vibe was not off for me

2896
04:28:19,920 --> 04:28:21,040
No, no, no, no

2897
04:28:21,040 --> 04:28:26,799
The vibes were off and on only at the very last 30 to minute 40 minutes of that of the stream

2898
04:28:27,920 --> 04:28:30,799
You know what I mean? Like when we couldn't beat the vibe vibes were kind of off

2899
04:28:32,049 --> 04:28:34,799
Vibes are on the entire time

2900
04:28:34,799 --> 04:28:36,799
Except for the last 30 minutes vibes are off

2901
04:28:38,149 --> 04:28:44,469
Vibes have been on this whole entire time. How do you feel the vibes would be just out of curiosity if

2902
04:28:44,950 --> 04:28:47,750
Every time we entered a boss room, we like beat it first try

2903
04:28:51,559 --> 04:28:55,319
Is that like good vibes or is that like this is a little bit too

2904
04:28:55,879 --> 04:29:01,399
Like we're too good. They need to stop us. I feel like how good we are. I feel like the vibes would be

2905
04:29:02,979 --> 04:29:03,940
not

2906
04:29:03,940 --> 04:29:04,979
Great

2907
04:29:04,979 --> 04:29:07,940
But uh, there's one kind of in parentheses after that

2908
04:29:08,500 --> 04:29:16,040
Okay vibes not great, but this is randomizer and it's possible that we just absolutely

2909
04:29:16,600 --> 04:29:23,079
Just power stack our weapons crazy and there's like a mad soldier in one of these rooms, right? Yeah, that's not

2910
04:29:24,280 --> 04:29:28,040
That's only happened once we're getting a lot of like actual bosses

2911
04:29:29,209 --> 04:29:37,000
They gotta be running out of them. Yeah, they gotta be running out of salamanders at some point and then put the other

2912
04:29:37,319 --> 04:29:40,899
Parentheses bracket around it. Whatever

2913
04:29:41,700 --> 04:29:47,059
Vibes not great, but this is random. I suppose we just power stack our weapons. There's a mad soldier in this room

2914
04:29:47,700 --> 04:29:55,239
That's an extreme title that that should be the stream title if i'm really honest that should be the title

2915
04:30:03,020 --> 04:30:09,670
God so stupid. Someone should just build a ladder here

2916
04:30:25,030 --> 04:30:27,270
I got another seed. Did you get the golden seed there?

2917
04:30:28,069 --> 04:30:30,870
It is not a golden seed for me. It's been a golden seed

2918
04:30:31,750 --> 04:30:37,270
On i'm not saying that's why you you were getting golden seeds from those. Yeah, i'm getting smithing stones from them

2919
04:30:37,270 --> 04:30:40,709
That's why my weapon is plus 28. So that's what's been going on

2920
04:30:48,889 --> 04:30:50,889
All right, I want to see what's in this back area

2921
04:30:51,209 --> 04:30:55,110
See if there's any consumable items picking up

2922
04:30:55,909 --> 04:31:00,809
bears in the wall

2923
04:31:00,809 --> 04:31:07,110
There is a bear in the wall. It's got like a fire buff

2924
04:31:09,459 --> 04:31:29,979
Okay, that's all

2925
04:31:29,979 --> 04:31:36,200
It's a good title. It's a very confusing title if you're

2926
04:31:36,840 --> 04:31:44,180
Not currently here right now. Oh

2927
04:31:44,819 --> 04:31:58,010
That's scary

2928
04:31:59,530 --> 04:32:19,610
You get it

2929
04:32:19,610 --> 04:32:24,489
Yeah, I got that mogul like I was kind of hoping that you were just gonna fall on your back by the screen

2930
04:32:24,569 --> 04:32:25,770
That would have been funny

2931
04:32:25,770 --> 04:32:42,459
Somebody said i've been having the stream in the background and I have this weird subliminal message of wanting smoothies. Did you do something?

2932
04:32:43,610 --> 04:32:48,329
It was yeah something you said something like that. I just paraphrased I paraphrased your entire comment

2933
04:32:52,469 --> 04:33:05,540
It was in that same ballpark. It was that same world. I think we gotta go up this ladder

2934
04:33:07,430 --> 04:33:22,099
That's not even real. This ladder goes up. Watch out. There's goons in here

2935
04:33:25,659 --> 04:33:29,659
Actually, this place is way worse usually. Oh cool. I found uh on the traps

2936
04:33:30,380 --> 04:33:33,750
is this the place where there's the

2937
04:33:33,750 --> 04:33:35,750
That big like a centipede bug thing

2938
04:33:36,389 --> 04:33:40,630
No, there's a million little baby boys and they all throw poison at you. Oh, okay

2939
04:33:41,590 --> 04:33:44,069
And there's like a bunch of traps on the ground as you run away from them

2940
04:33:45,799 --> 04:33:48,099
Is there an item? I think there is

2941
04:33:49,189 --> 04:33:51,189
Yeah, there's an item that's it's gonna be

2942
04:33:51,349 --> 04:33:53,750
Dung don't even it's gonna be like a glass shard

2943
04:33:58,580 --> 04:34:03,299
I remember my my elden ring playthrough. I was saying there's a lot of like moments like that where it's like

2944
04:34:03,380 --> 04:34:06,259
Oh, you missed the item going up the elevator to just like

2945
04:34:07,380 --> 04:34:11,860
To make it take longer to do something and then you go get it and it's like, oh you found like

2946
04:34:12,659 --> 04:34:15,270
I don't know

2947
04:34:15,270 --> 04:34:23,610
Nothing. I got a giant crusher the weapon called giant crusher. I think the point is sometimes the journey is more important than the destination

2948
04:34:24,470 --> 04:34:28,150
So it's being able to actually see that there's something cool for you to do

2949
04:34:29,770 --> 04:34:32,220
It's with any kind of reward

2950
04:34:32,220 --> 04:34:38,080
This is an interesting concept because it makes you feel like that you've done a good job paying attention to the game's environment

2951
04:34:40,810 --> 04:34:42,810
And I just got the axe of godric

2952
04:34:43,290 --> 04:34:45,290
changing character immediately

2953
04:34:45,930 --> 04:34:51,189
Again, this guy cannot use an item

2954
04:34:52,790 --> 04:34:54,790
For more than 30 seconds

2955
04:34:56,939 --> 04:34:58,939
I think that was a pretty good way to explain that

2956
04:35:07,720 --> 04:35:11,299
You want like a crossbow or anything?

2957
04:35:11,299 --> 04:35:14,900
No

2958
04:35:14,900 --> 04:35:22,389
Why not?

2959
04:35:22,389 --> 04:35:24,389
Did you need a somber seven?

2960
04:35:24,790 --> 04:35:26,069
Uh

2961
04:35:26,069 --> 04:35:29,450
I think you're at five. You need a six. Yeah, I need a six

2962
04:35:30,090 --> 04:35:32,169
You just go seven

2963
04:35:32,169 --> 04:35:34,169
Yeah, I have a seven

2964
04:35:34,650 --> 04:35:36,250
Yeah, I think we're both

2965
04:35:36,250 --> 04:35:38,729
In the same situation where I need I think I need

2966
04:35:40,139 --> 04:35:44,939
Sevens of regular I need a six and an eight and then the final one and I just think it'd be plus 10

2967
04:35:45,659 --> 04:35:52,419
I think I have an eight. Well, I don't

2968
04:35:54,099 --> 04:35:56,099
Everything's wrong. I want whatever that is

2969
04:36:15,700 --> 04:36:17,060
Slider goes up

2970
04:36:17,060 --> 04:36:23,529
I need to rest

2971
04:36:23,529 --> 04:36:25,750
Now poison's almost over

2972
04:36:25,750 --> 04:36:31,270
We were just at a bonfire right before we came through here. Yeah, but the poison they got they got a purple item for me

2973
04:36:33,180 --> 04:36:37,290
Battle I would refill my mana. That's true

2974
04:36:43,099 --> 04:36:49,380
Oh shit

2975
04:36:49,380 --> 04:36:51,380
No, no

2976
04:36:57,080 --> 04:37:28,040
What's up, what else is here? Well, it's a little scary. I think it's a free kill though. I didn't fall

2977
04:37:46,229 --> 04:37:47,430
Uh-huh

2978
04:37:47,430 --> 04:38:03,450
See what i'm dealing with here. Let's see what you're dealing with here a lot of um souls

2979
04:38:03,770 --> 04:38:14,599
Uh, there is an item up here. I should definitely come up here. I'm

2980
04:38:16,599 --> 04:38:18,619
Wait, how do you get up there?

2981
04:38:18,619 --> 04:38:24,630
Around the left side over here in the rocks. It's a koopy normal item

2982
04:38:25,369 --> 04:38:27,930
Oh, i'm getting it. I'm getting it

2983
04:38:28,810 --> 04:38:31,880
It's gonna be like a spell

2984
04:38:31,880 --> 04:38:34,439
It's gonna be like godric's last gall

2985
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:39,939
But again, this is another place. I didn't know you can come up here

2986
04:38:41,540 --> 04:38:45,860
You're really teaching me a lot. I'm really learned. You're i'm really educated right now

2987
04:38:46,419 --> 04:38:54,790
Is there a mod they're using for seamless co-op? Yes

2988
04:38:55,669 --> 04:38:58,229
a seamless co-op

2989
04:38:58,310 --> 04:39:01,509
Uh, i'm gonna sing the praises of this mod another time

2990
04:39:03,349 --> 04:39:09,369
Randomizer was hard to set up just because it's like oh match the right seed and get all these things in the right folders

2991
04:39:09,369 --> 04:39:11,369
And make sure you set the right settings

2992
04:39:11,369 --> 04:39:12,889
Seamless co-op

2993
04:39:12,889 --> 04:39:14,709
is literally

2994
04:39:14,709 --> 04:39:16,599
Two files

2995
04:39:16,599 --> 04:39:21,479
It it's you don't have to do anything else besides just get the bit of passwords

2996
04:39:22,279 --> 04:39:24,580
it's

2997
04:39:24,580 --> 04:39:27,380
It's probably the easiest mod i've ever installed i've ever used

2998
04:39:28,099 --> 04:39:31,380
Would you say the same thing sir?

2999
04:39:31,380 --> 04:39:36,500
Uh, yeah, I guess a little bit complicated when you're trying to have exactly the same mods like the randomizer. Yeah

3000
04:39:36,900 --> 04:39:40,580
But the actual seamless co-op is just like a file in game folder done

3001
04:39:41,990 --> 04:39:45,130
It's actually insane word

3002
04:39:46,549 --> 04:39:49,669
I was concerned when we when we first started talking about this. I was concerned that

3003
04:39:50,470 --> 04:39:53,909
Oh, man, this is a whole ordeal. Isn't it? This is a whole thing

3004
04:39:54,630 --> 04:39:57,990
I see I felt bad too because I kind of turned it into a whole ordeal

3005
04:39:58,470 --> 04:39:59,669
Yeah

3006
04:39:59,669 --> 04:40:03,990
No, how did you exactly what you were trying to avoid, but how would you have known right like this?

3007
04:40:04,549 --> 04:40:07,240
There's no way you would have known

3008
04:40:07,240 --> 04:40:09,240
Please just let me feel bad. No

3009
04:40:09,639 --> 04:40:11,099
Step on me

3010
04:40:11,099 --> 04:40:12,380
No

3011
04:40:12,380 --> 04:40:14,060
It's undeserved

3012
04:40:14,060 --> 04:40:17,180
It's undeserved

3013
04:40:17,180 --> 04:40:22,060
There's no way you would have known that with these two things together and the amount of trying to figure it

3014
04:40:22,380 --> 04:40:28,409
We had to figure it out

3015
04:40:28,409 --> 04:40:33,689
I really do. Um, I mentioned it yesterday and then you like ignored me and then didn't hear me and probably

3016
04:40:34,490 --> 04:40:38,810
Just like spit on the ground on your stream. Yeah, but i've heard i've heard

3017
04:40:41,180 --> 04:40:45,180
Yeah, I don't it could be a good one. What if it's a legendary? What if you missed it? Yeah, okay

3018
04:40:48,740 --> 04:40:50,779
lump of flesh

3019
04:40:50,779 --> 04:40:52,659
Sorry, I made you do that

3020
04:40:52,659 --> 04:40:56,500
Uh, I was gonna say like I don't know if you want to try neo 2 sometimes because I did hear it was really good

3021
04:40:56,580 --> 04:40:58,500
and it also has like

3022
04:40:58,500 --> 04:41:00,500
The co-op just kind of works

3023
04:41:02,650 --> 04:41:05,529
Is I tried to play neo a few times?

3024
04:41:06,779 --> 04:41:09,020
Just on my own time

3025
04:41:09,099 --> 04:41:11,819
I just didn't I didn't like all the stance switching stuff

3026
04:41:12,459 --> 04:41:14,619
I yeah, I was a little annoyed by

3027
04:41:15,340 --> 04:41:19,659
How overly complicated it was too. I'm not sure if that's still a thing

3028
04:41:21,290 --> 04:41:27,369
I say I want it simple exhausted by that as well. I just want it. I just want light attack heavy attack

3029
04:41:27,450 --> 04:41:32,409
You can call me just an absolute small brain andy. That's fine. But like I just want it swing

3030
04:41:33,209 --> 04:41:34,490
regular swing

3031
04:41:34,490 --> 04:41:36,889
Strong swing and the weapons are cool. It's just

3032
04:41:37,689 --> 04:41:41,610
I don't like the stances like up down, you know the distance it's that that stance that stance

3033
04:41:47,669 --> 04:41:49,669
It's definitely really cool

3034
04:41:50,919 --> 04:41:57,240
It just gives you more tools to play with but I want less tools and if that makes me a dope then so be it

3035
04:41:58,549 --> 04:42:00,630
No, that makes sense. I agree with you. I

3036
04:42:02,630 --> 04:42:04,259
It was a lot

3037
04:42:04,259 --> 04:42:06,259
It was it's certainly a much less like

3038
04:42:06,740 --> 04:42:13,139
It's weird to say that because like dark souls isn't a casual experience, but neo was like even less of a casual experience

3039
04:42:16,099 --> 04:42:18,099
Where does neo sit?

3040
04:42:18,819 --> 04:42:20,819
Where like sakiro?

3041
04:42:21,270 --> 04:42:24,549
like is neo harder than sakiro is neo kind of more

3042
04:42:25,500 --> 04:42:32,229
Kind of challenging and more skill-based than sakiro was I I didn't play a lot. I don't know

3043
04:42:32,549 --> 04:42:38,389
It's harder than sakiro really. Oh my goodness. I don't think I do remember it being very hard

3044
04:42:39,430 --> 04:42:43,430
And it has like a whole I think neo 2 has like a whole like end game loot finding like

3045
04:42:44,069 --> 04:42:47,029
Find like item stuff farming and whatnot

3046
04:42:47,990 --> 04:42:53,849
So I imagine it just keeps getting harder sakiro is easier to be honest, huh?

3047
04:42:56,599 --> 04:43:03,349
Wow

3048
04:43:03,349 --> 04:43:05,110
What's that?

3049
04:43:05,110 --> 04:43:10,680
fist weapon

3050
04:43:10,680 --> 04:43:11,959
It is

3051
04:43:11,959 --> 04:43:18,330
star fist

3052
04:43:18,330 --> 04:43:20,490
Holy shit. These are cool

3053
04:43:20,490 --> 04:43:22,869
What this is awesome

3054
04:43:22,869 --> 04:43:27,220
time to change

3055
04:43:33,369 --> 04:43:35,369
Neo is more bullshit difficulty than anything

3056
04:43:38,569 --> 04:43:43,290
It looks really fun. It looks really cool. I just I tried to play it a few times

3057
04:43:43,930 --> 04:43:47,099
I just that the first zone

3058
04:43:47,659 --> 04:43:51,180
Just I I leave at the same point in the first zone every time

3059
04:43:52,889 --> 04:43:56,889
After like the first hour to two hours like almost I want to say up to three hours

3060
04:43:56,970 --> 04:43:59,049
It's like yeah, no i'm not into this and I leave

3061
04:43:59,529 --> 04:44:09,259
Did I miss an item? It is kind of bullshit. I feel like this conversation is actually turning me more like i've been wanting to play it

3062
04:44:09,500 --> 04:44:10,779
I bought it

3063
04:44:10,779 --> 04:44:12,779
And this conversation is like, you know what?

3064
04:44:13,259 --> 04:44:17,819
Maybe not. I really do feel like and if it's it is bullshit difficulty. I don't know

3065
04:44:18,380 --> 04:44:20,939
Well, how does neo one compare to neo two?

3066
04:44:22,139 --> 04:44:24,139
Is neo two like a better

3067
04:44:24,540 --> 04:44:26,779
less bullshit kind of better game

3068
04:44:27,580 --> 04:44:30,520
I think they were saying that that's what

3069
04:44:30,840 --> 04:44:36,759
Neo is also bullshit. They're saying it's way better though. Like it's way way better. I heard it was very good

3070
04:44:37,639 --> 04:44:40,119
Because around the time that like I finished elgin ring

3071
04:44:40,439 --> 04:44:44,680
There was a lot of comments on uh neo two like the reviews on steven that were like yeah

3072
04:44:44,680 --> 04:44:47,720
I beat elgin ring and I need it. I like need it more

3073
04:44:48,520 --> 04:44:51,240
So we all came here and this game's actually pretty good

3074
04:44:54,569 --> 04:44:58,889
So the magma worm is supposed to be up here, but I wonder if it's not a magma worm

3075
04:44:59,880 --> 04:45:01,720
I hope it's a magma worm

3076
04:45:01,720 --> 04:45:05,799
It's gonna make me very happy if it were a magma worm

3077
04:45:06,439 --> 04:45:17,180
I hope I just didn't break something

3078
04:45:17,180 --> 04:45:26,459
Are we getting a cutscene or am I in my computer crashing? You might be computer crashing. Yep. Well i'll be here

3079
04:45:27,299 --> 04:45:29,080
Okay, i'm gonna beat the boss

3080
04:45:29,080 --> 04:45:34,680
Don't go in don't do the boss reveal randomizer boss reveal without the other player. That's bm

3081
04:45:40,840 --> 04:45:42,360
Oh my god, it's elgin

3082
04:45:47,029 --> 04:46:02,759
Sounds cool, and then you then you beat it and the game ends. Oh, I think I crashed again

3083
04:46:03,939 --> 04:46:04,900
Oh

3084
04:46:04,900 --> 04:46:07,700
On start spicing things up on startup this time weird

3085
04:46:10,840 --> 04:46:57,240
Did you use the right launcher? Yeah, this is hard crashed. Okay, let's try that again. Come on. Come on, please

3086
04:47:04,150 --> 04:47:08,919
Okay. No good. Thank god. It looked like it crashed again, but i'm good. I'm coming back

3087
04:47:23,740 --> 04:47:26,299
Uh, can you put a new one of those thingies down?

3088
04:47:31,689 --> 04:47:32,650
I did

3089
04:47:32,650 --> 04:47:53,270
I feel bad for that version of my character because they're just gonna get their ass kicked

3090
04:47:57,049 --> 04:48:02,250
I think what happened is we both sat down and we both I I had touch grace was on my um

3091
04:48:02,650 --> 04:48:06,650
Indicator and I think we both did it at the exact same time and I think it crashed me

3092
04:48:16,490 --> 04:48:20,169
I can't believe this is elden beast. Don't say don't go in yet. Don't go in yet

3093
04:48:22,979 --> 04:48:25,540
Uh, I have too many souls and I want to level up. We do this

3094
04:48:33,659 --> 04:48:37,340
I can't believe this is elder. Yes. Can I have some runes?

3095
04:48:38,630 --> 04:48:41,430
Can you have some runes? I need like 1200

3096
04:48:42,540 --> 04:48:45,979
Well, how many how many levels higher than me? Are you?

3097
04:48:46,459 --> 04:48:53,459
i'll be right back because I keep I feel like I keep loaning your runes and you're like

3098
04:48:54,240 --> 04:48:56,240
700 levels higher than me

3099
04:49:04,520 --> 04:49:05,880
I got a new staff

3100
04:49:05,880 --> 04:49:10,619
Do you want to look at it? What staff? I don't I probably don't need it. I have the staff

3101
04:49:10,619 --> 04:49:12,619
I want just not the magic I want

3102
04:49:14,819 --> 04:49:27,299
Okay, that's enough. What is that thing? When did I get this?

3103
04:49:28,020 --> 04:49:35,659
Boy this thing gives strength doesn't it now gives decks a bunch of boys

3104
04:49:36,380 --> 04:49:43,799
I should probably just put it on

3105
04:49:43,799 --> 04:49:46,680
Why not? It'd be more damage, right?

3106
04:49:49,259 --> 04:49:51,259
And this scales a little bit off decks. All right

3107
04:49:51,419 --> 04:49:53,139
You ready?

3108
04:49:53,139 --> 04:49:58,439
All right. Oh my god, I didn't even upgrade

3109
04:50:02,060 --> 04:50:03,259
All right, ready

3110
04:50:03,259 --> 04:50:05,259
Now I am officially ready to go. Let's go

3111
04:50:05,819 --> 04:50:10,810
What is it gonna be?

3112
04:50:10,810 --> 04:50:12,569
it's gonna be

3113
04:50:12,569 --> 04:50:17,740
That's goku. It's

3114
04:50:22,950 --> 04:50:27,110
a

3115
04:50:27,110 --> 04:50:35,240
Um, what the fuck?

3116
04:50:37,319 --> 04:50:40,759
What the hell happened holy shit

3117
04:50:41,880 --> 04:50:45,880
Um, good luck. We're just we're not doing this. I don't think we're gonna beat this one

3118
04:50:47,080 --> 04:50:49,080
I think we're not beating this one

3119
04:50:53,990 --> 04:50:56,470
We gotta the thing we're gonna break the thing on his ankle. Where is it?

3120
04:50:57,819 --> 04:50:59,180
Which ankle is it?

3121
04:50:59,180 --> 04:51:05,319
Which leg I can't even I don't want what leg is it on?

3122
04:51:06,119 --> 04:51:10,900
It's on his left leg

3123
04:51:10,900 --> 04:51:15,299
Is he wearing a tumeric bracelet? Yeah, we gotta get the tumeric bracelet. It's on his left leg

3124
04:51:16,889 --> 04:51:20,540
Okay. Well, it's probably on the leg. That's like like a lower half

3125
04:51:21,930 --> 04:51:24,540
Good luck, man

3126
04:51:24,540 --> 04:51:29,529
We actually did a good amount of damage

3127
04:51:29,529 --> 04:51:33,450
Yeah, gonna break the bracelet on his left leg. The second phase is gonna be horrible here

3128
04:51:45,479 --> 04:51:52,259
Uh-oh

3129
04:51:52,259 --> 04:51:55,299
What the fuck? I don't know dude. It's not where did that fire come from?

3130
04:51:58,470 --> 04:52:01,509
This is phase two. It is you're right. He's

3131
04:52:02,549 --> 04:52:05,900
What?

3132
04:52:05,900 --> 04:52:08,220
That's right. The bracelet's already broken

3133
04:52:13,430 --> 04:52:20,540
What he summoned the slow moving things and they like finally caught up to me and it convoked me

3134
04:52:20,860 --> 04:52:22,860
We're gonna we're gonna be here for a little while

3135
04:52:24,439 --> 04:52:27,240
Yeah, you I I walked in and I saw him shooting in the air

3136
04:52:27,240 --> 04:52:32,009
He's like that's weird because he doesn't do that until phase two. He had a great

3137
04:52:32,569 --> 04:52:36,020
Uh entrance though probably best entrance of the whole time. We've been playing

3138
04:52:36,580 --> 04:52:38,259
Yeah, I don't think this is gonna be hard

3139
04:52:38,259 --> 04:52:41,700
As long as we're not being like sabotaged by like someone telling me to like fight the ankle

3140
04:52:43,639 --> 04:52:46,520
And like can't find out which leg and he literally only has one leg

3141
04:52:47,240 --> 04:52:51,799
But I I thought it was very I don't know that you fight the ankle on phase one

3142
04:52:52,279 --> 04:52:56,040
I'm just saying there's a couple of things with your story that are not lining up

3143
04:52:58,599 --> 04:53:01,000
Okay, wait i'm gonna put on some like fire resistance or something

3144
04:53:01,639 --> 04:53:08,360
Oh, yeah, let's cheese it and like be prepared for the fight like losers. Yeah

3145
04:53:10,150 --> 04:53:11,750
Let's like

3146
04:53:11,750 --> 04:53:14,549
Prepare for this fight you fucking dweeb

3147
04:53:15,189 --> 04:53:18,549
Get in here i'm putting gear on and why I don't

3148
04:53:19,189 --> 04:53:21,830
I need to get my fire resistance. Oh, hurry up

3149
04:53:22,229 --> 04:53:25,430
Magma giant just get on the horses skip the whole game and then uh,

3150
04:53:25,509 --> 04:53:30,470
Missed seven bosses in ten areas and y'all ramp it up already fire resistance gear on

3151
04:53:30,950 --> 04:53:38,490
Coming that's the same damage if you dodge it

3152
04:53:46,459 --> 04:53:54,580
All right tack the hands

3153
04:53:54,580 --> 04:53:56,180
Okay

3154
04:53:56,180 --> 04:54:17,830
That was dumb

3155
04:54:17,830 --> 04:54:21,349
Jesus how did I not get hit by that? I have no idea

3156
04:54:22,069 --> 04:54:30,299
Why does he move his hand?

3157
04:54:30,299 --> 04:54:48,040
That is really annoying

3158
04:54:48,040 --> 04:54:50,470
What the fuck?

3159
04:54:51,270 --> 04:54:53,270
He is really he actually is

3160
04:54:59,430 --> 04:55:03,110
Stop every time I go for the hand. I just he just instant moves it

3161
04:55:03,830 --> 04:55:20,209
We're doing pretty good

3162
04:55:20,209 --> 04:55:21,990
staggered really

3163
04:55:21,990 --> 04:55:28,819
Is there a place to hit him anywhere?

3164
04:55:29,139 --> 04:55:42,840
His hands. I mean I like uh, but I don't think he has a stab point

3165
04:55:47,720 --> 04:55:52,009
Uh, it's bullshit again

3166
04:55:52,090 --> 04:55:54,090
Oh my god

3167
04:56:05,220 --> 04:56:20,740
What oh

3168
04:56:20,740 --> 04:56:24,259
Stop moving. Oh my god. I feel like I just crushed like a bug

3169
04:56:24,979 --> 04:56:29,959
He's going psycho mode on you

3170
04:56:29,959 --> 04:56:36,869
Yeah, he is

3171
04:56:36,869 --> 04:56:39,509
I don't know why i'm casting this magic. It's too powerful

3172
04:56:44,150 --> 04:56:46,150
Make it rain

3173
04:56:49,430 --> 04:56:50,709
Why does that

3174
04:56:50,709 --> 04:56:56,310
That's like why is that up there? Why is make it rain make it rain. Why is it up there?

3175
04:56:56,549 --> 04:56:58,549
I don't know where why it's up there in your head

3176
04:56:59,590 --> 04:57:01,509
Why not?

3177
04:57:01,509 --> 04:57:08,549
Oh now now you just made me laugh and now i'm having problems. I was dodging every attack. Everything was going so smoothly

3178
04:57:15,259 --> 04:57:25,299
Make it rain

3179
04:57:25,299 --> 04:57:36,119
Make it rain

3180
04:57:36,119 --> 04:57:39,080
When was the last time you even played that game seriously?

3181
04:57:39,799 --> 04:57:43,849
Uh, I don't know years and years

3182
04:57:45,689 --> 04:57:48,970
I actually played like once a year ago, maybe with uh

3183
04:57:49,770 --> 04:57:51,770
Like moon was playing

3184
04:57:53,349 --> 04:57:55,349
It's still like a pretty fun game

3185
04:57:56,389 --> 04:57:58,869
It is yeah, i'm surprised they still get like a whole bunch of content

3186
04:58:03,240 --> 04:58:07,319
Nice job a lot of my chat. I don't think god it's it's a quote from smite

3187
04:58:08,970 --> 04:58:12,409
When uh, one of the characters who shoots fireballs is make it rain

3188
04:58:13,529 --> 04:58:15,529
Yeah, it's agony

3189
04:58:15,689 --> 04:58:17,450
Agni has this move

3190
04:58:17,450 --> 04:58:21,529
It only in one of his skins but germa. I i'm aware that germa loves it

3191
04:58:22,250 --> 04:58:25,450
I mean, it's just I have not heard that in a very long time

3192
04:58:26,090 --> 04:58:28,889
I got a sacred tear

3193
04:58:28,889 --> 04:58:33,610
I totally spaced out and I was thinking about swag knee. I think I got one too. I don't even know

3194
04:58:34,650 --> 04:58:37,369
Oh, the doubters lost out big time. I think here

3195
04:58:40,380 --> 04:58:42,459
Sorry doubters. You lost a lot

3196
04:58:43,830 --> 04:58:45,830
I my personal recommendation

3197
04:58:46,310 --> 04:58:48,310
Is to be a believer

3198
04:58:48,310 --> 04:58:50,150
from this point forward

3199
04:58:50,150 --> 04:58:59,560
Yeah, I would say so too. I have enough to level up again more strength

3200
04:59:00,360 --> 04:59:08,569
Really? Oh

3201
04:59:08,569 --> 04:59:09,689
Hold on

3202
04:59:09,689 --> 04:59:14,229
It's 26. I think

3203
04:59:14,229 --> 04:59:18,630
You know you see the runes needed number all the time, but the second that it goes away

3204
04:59:18,869 --> 04:59:20,950
It's gone from your memory. Has it happened to you too?

3205
04:59:22,680 --> 04:59:25,000
I haven't I honestly have been like forgetting to level

3206
04:59:26,200 --> 04:59:33,750
Constantly, so I really haven't been looking at that. However, I can relate in programming

3207
04:59:35,000 --> 04:59:39,080
Constantly open up something then like oh, yeah, I need to do that and i'll close a window and be like wait

3208
04:59:41,299 --> 04:59:53,080
What was I doing?

3209
04:59:53,080 --> 04:59:55,610
No object permanence

3210
04:59:55,610 --> 04:59:59,849
You know, I do envy people that have really really good object permanence

3211
05:00:01,340 --> 05:00:03,500
I just how do you how do you have good?

3212
05:00:04,700 --> 05:00:05,819
All right

3213
05:00:05,819 --> 05:00:07,900
What's the scale? Okay. Let me paint a picture for you

3214
05:00:09,740 --> 05:00:13,900
If you you know go somewhere you take you know, you take your car you go somewhere

3215
05:00:13,979 --> 05:00:19,500
I'm gonna go the the store or you lost me. You actually lost me already. All right, but just anybody that's listening

3216
05:00:20,220 --> 05:00:27,500
Don't have a license. I can't relate. Okay, so then just you just can hang out. I

3217
05:00:28,139 --> 05:00:35,099
Always no matter what doesn't matter where I go where I park. I always don't know the exact location of my car

3218
05:00:36,259 --> 05:00:41,000
Every time even when I say I look at the parking space. I go this is where I am

3219
05:00:41,080 --> 05:00:45,590
I got to remember this an hour goes by two hours go by and then it's just

3220
05:00:46,310 --> 05:00:51,509
I know the general vicinity of where the car is, but I don't have any idea where it is

3221
05:00:51,990 --> 05:00:55,189
That's not object permanence. Yes, it is. That's that's literally

3222
05:00:56,119 --> 05:01:01,560
ADHD that's object permanence. That's you keeping a thing in your brain and knowing where it is

3223
05:01:02,419 --> 05:01:08,729
That's object permanence. How's that not object permanence? It's the same thing. That's memory. What do you mean?

3224
05:01:09,509 --> 05:01:19,740
Object permanence is like forgetting something exists when it's outside of your view. I don't do that

3225
05:01:19,900 --> 05:01:28,759
I just forget where it is. I know it exists. I just don't know where like okay this big stone

3226
05:01:29,000 --> 05:01:32,360
Okay, so I guess I guess you're like you're like a five on the scale five out of ten

3227
05:01:32,439 --> 05:01:41,509
Yeah, it's not that bad and a one is like a toddler and you're like four points away from that object permanence would be hold on

3228
05:01:41,590 --> 05:01:48,090
Somebody said something. I want to read it. You have a bad memory. Yeah, so what object permanence?

3229
05:01:49,209 --> 05:01:54,569
Is is how peekaboo works with babies? Wait a minute. Yeah, that is

3230
05:01:55,130 --> 05:01:58,650
Object permanence would be if you forgot your car existed

3231
05:02:02,599 --> 05:02:07,400
Because he said it first and I saw it and I caught it it was in my mind a little bit object permanence problem there

3232
05:02:07,639 --> 05:02:11,000
But I did see it and I didn't I didn't I forgot it for a second. Then you said it

3233
05:02:12,040 --> 05:02:15,400
You like absolutely tuned me out. Can I turn my mic up? Like is there a problem?

3234
05:02:15,479 --> 05:02:18,729
You said I was quiet the other day. Are you there? Hello?

3235
05:02:20,810 --> 05:02:22,569
It's poor awareness

3236
05:02:22,569 --> 05:02:25,450
Whatever it is. It's what I have. It's awareness

3237
05:02:27,380 --> 05:02:32,500
It's it's all it's awareness. It's memory object memory awareness

3238
05:02:33,060 --> 05:02:34,419
Is that better?

3239
05:02:34,419 --> 05:02:37,020
Give a shit memory

3240
05:02:37,020 --> 05:02:42,139
Yeah

3241
05:02:42,139 --> 05:02:47,740
I lose my keys all the time my wallet memory. Yes, it is. No, no

3242
05:02:47,900 --> 05:02:49,900
How is losing your keys not memory?

3243
05:02:50,299 --> 05:02:56,299
It's not memory. This is a symptom of adult adhd where if you put something down you forget where it is

3244
05:02:56,860 --> 05:02:58,220
Not because your memory is bad

3245
05:02:58,220 --> 05:03:01,659
But what is forgetting about something else because your attention is on something else

3246
05:03:01,740 --> 05:03:06,860
You're not forgetting because you'd never have the memory of putting it somewhere because you're not focused on that

3247
05:03:06,860 --> 05:03:11,340
You're focused on something else, but that's memory. That is a that is you're talking about a piece of your memory

3248
05:03:11,740 --> 05:03:15,659
Short-term memory is memory short-term memory. Don't let him cook

3249
05:03:16,380 --> 05:03:24,810
No, let me eat. Okay. I'm done cooking. Okay. Uh, we I believe we just I think we we did it

3250
05:03:29,959 --> 05:03:41,419
We did it. Yeah, I think we can go fight radon. I'm barely certain we can go I think and i'm really really praying

3251
05:03:42,549 --> 05:03:46,150
That radon is like a normal soldier in a in a big empty desert

3252
05:03:58,569 --> 05:04:01,069
I think your dementia is contagious

3253
05:04:07,439 --> 05:04:10,080
I voted to teleport it was something going on. I did too

3254
05:04:11,659 --> 05:04:13,740
Did we pick the wrong one? I don't think so

3255
05:04:15,610 --> 05:04:17,930
Red main castle plaza. I think that's yeah, that's the one

3256
05:04:19,209 --> 05:04:23,610
Sometimes it's just a little weird. It can be a little weird

3257
05:04:24,169 --> 05:04:40,509
Turma has to buy a new car every time he leaves the house

3258
05:04:42,590 --> 05:04:44,590
Well, I never had a car before

3259
05:04:44,750 --> 05:04:49,069
I guess I have to have I guess I have to get one and i've got to i'm gonna drive

3260
05:04:49,709 --> 05:04:56,490
Oh, you hear the halo music?

3261
05:05:16,569 --> 05:05:18,569
Before we begin did you cut him off?

3262
05:05:19,930 --> 05:05:21,930
I'm in the cutscene. Yeah, I am too

3263
05:05:23,529 --> 05:05:25,880
Are we skipping?

3264
05:05:25,880 --> 05:05:28,119
Yeah, you want to watch his horse?

3265
05:05:28,279 --> 05:05:32,119
Die, do you want to watch his horse die? No, I we've i've seen this cutscene a lot

3266
05:05:33,000 --> 05:05:38,439
Okay, it's kind of like fucked up. I don't want to fight him yet because I have a lot of uh,

3267
05:05:39,479 --> 05:05:45,880
I need to level up. We're gonna win. We're gonna first try dude. No coward coward coward first try coward first try coward

3268
05:05:45,880 --> 05:05:47,240
There's a lot to lose

3269
05:05:47,240 --> 05:05:50,119
First try coward. You'll pick it back up when we go in again if we die

3270
05:05:50,200 --> 05:05:56,119
What we're gonna first try it you you agreed when I said no more doubters object permanence andy you should believe now

3271
05:05:57,439 --> 05:05:59,439
Short-term memory andy you think i'm gonna

3272
05:05:59,439 --> 05:06:01,560
Come on

3273
05:06:01,560 --> 05:06:03,560
Come on

3274
05:06:05,599 --> 05:06:09,799
Lot to lose there man

3275
05:06:09,799 --> 05:06:12,200
I thought I was gonna be alive. I really did

3276
05:06:12,759 --> 05:06:28,439
I was I thought it was gonna be like two hp, you know, I need to get my I need to get those back

3277
05:06:28,919 --> 05:06:37,790
Dude, you got this wrong object permanence would be forgetting the ground exists

3278
05:06:40,380 --> 05:06:44,060
How extreme are we going? Uh, that's okay. That's very extreme

3279
05:06:44,060 --> 05:06:48,939
I forgot that I am an object and that actually I am inhabiting this body on earth

3280
05:06:49,659 --> 05:06:54,939
I thought I was on the astral plane. I dreamed that I was a butterfly. I feel like there's there's levels

3281
05:06:54,939 --> 05:06:57,099
There's tiers of this. It's not just like

3282
05:06:58,119 --> 05:07:03,479
Oh object permanence issue. That means you must not understand. Yeah that you're holding a sword

3283
05:07:03,720 --> 05:07:07,159
You let it go and then you picked it up and it's the first time you've ever seen it

3284
05:07:09,419 --> 05:07:13,419
That's uh, that's augerins. Will they be down first try? I don't know. This is a good

3285
05:07:13,500 --> 05:07:15,500
This is tough because we who know it could be

3286
05:07:15,740 --> 05:07:17,500
It could be something really annoying

3287
05:07:17,500 --> 05:07:20,939
That's the first try. This is the first triangle. I we're not i'm not losing this

3288
05:07:20,939 --> 05:07:25,340
I'm committed to not losing this and i'm 100 sure. This is going to be like a crab

3289
05:07:26,459 --> 05:07:28,880
And what is it?

3290
05:07:28,880 --> 05:07:32,840
Star it's godric

3291
05:07:32,840 --> 05:07:38,200
Uh phase two godric or we're gonna summon everybody. We have to see that. We have to see what that

3292
05:07:38,759 --> 05:07:40,759
No, we do. I want to see what the outfits are

3293
05:07:41,479 --> 05:07:44,840
They're all gonna have funny outfits. That's that's true

3294
05:07:45,560 --> 05:07:47,880
The voters didn't know we were summoning all the guys

3295
05:07:48,680 --> 05:07:50,680
This guy's got fucking rivers of blood

3296
05:07:53,400 --> 05:07:55,319
Just let them fight

3297
05:07:55,319 --> 05:07:59,000
Don't even play the game just summon everybody because there's no there's no way they're gonna die

3298
05:08:01,930 --> 05:08:06,250
If you bet against this yeah true actually if you bet against this you are you just trying to lose your money

3299
05:08:06,409 --> 05:08:07,930
I'm just trying to lose your points

3300
05:08:07,930 --> 05:08:14,439
Now here's the real question. Where is godric? Are they just hanging out somewhere? He's gonna be up on the hill

3301
05:08:14,599 --> 05:08:19,240
What is what is uh, what does blade have for like stuff? He looks the same. Let's see

3302
05:08:20,590 --> 05:08:23,099
Yeah

3303
05:08:23,099 --> 05:08:27,099
Yeah, he might be like what are you doing dude? You gotta you gotta walk up there with the boys

3304
05:08:27,900 --> 05:08:32,200
Oh shit, he's running. Let's go. Oh shit. He is running. Wait, what the fuck?

3305
05:08:35,319 --> 05:08:36,200
Oh

3306
05:08:36,200 --> 05:08:39,720
For some reason I was thinking of a different boss. All right, let's see how they do

3307
05:08:44,279 --> 05:08:46,360
Wait, there's more people to summon up there. There's uh

3308
05:08:47,080 --> 05:08:49,290
Is this

3309
05:08:49,290 --> 05:08:53,500
I know there's like a healer, right?

3310
05:08:53,500 --> 05:08:54,939
Yep

3311
05:08:54,939 --> 05:08:58,029
maiden

3312
05:08:58,029 --> 05:09:07,979
All right, let's see how they do

3313
05:09:07,979 --> 05:09:09,740
Somebody died already

3314
05:09:09,740 --> 05:09:17,450
Dude, if you guys can't beat godric, I don't know how you ever thought you're gonna beat radon

3315
05:09:24,139 --> 05:09:31,049
Where's sigward this is a major let your ambitions to rest moment

3316
05:09:39,360 --> 05:09:41,360
No, you should have waited

3317
05:09:44,349 --> 05:09:48,830
They're dying dude. Yeah, they're not doing that great the healers on the look at the healer behind us

3318
05:09:49,470 --> 05:09:58,459
They're stuck. Oh, no, is she stuck? Yeah, she was stuck inside all the rubble. Come on quinn get in there

3319
05:09:59,099 --> 05:10:08,830
She's kind of smart

3320
05:10:08,830 --> 05:10:13,979
She's waiting for the real gamers to get in there before she buffs us

3321
05:10:14,619 --> 05:10:19,819
She's gonna be throwing lightning spears and show. Oh, wait, where's blade going?

3322
05:10:22,779 --> 05:10:24,779
Wait, where is he going?

3323
05:10:25,759 --> 05:10:28,060
Wait is it

3324
05:10:28,060 --> 05:10:29,900
Why is he running over here?

3325
05:10:29,900 --> 05:10:32,939
He's just floating in the sky on my screen. I think he died. All right, let's get him

3326
05:10:40,380 --> 05:10:42,540
Oh, they said you gotta run away from this shit. I forgot about that

3327
05:10:45,200 --> 05:10:47,200
I'm only doing comedy spell

3328
05:10:47,360 --> 05:10:50,560
I'm gonna need you to hold him in place

3329

You got him. Thank you

3330

When does he go?

3332
05:11:05,799 --> 05:11:09,639
Giving the doubters some hope

3333
05:11:09,639 --> 05:11:11,639
I like the part where he goes

3334
05:11:20,009 --> 05:11:22,090

3339
05:11:44,439 --> 05:11:46,040
Even at half health

3340
05:11:46,040 --> 05:11:48,860
Like it's not him leaving. It's just him doing a cut scene

3341
05:11:50,860 --> 05:11:54,540
Here it is. Oh, he's actually oh he does do it. Have you been paying attention?

3342
05:11:55,020 --> 05:11:57,020
Don't make fun of me when you're the dope

3343
05:11:57,819 --> 05:12:10,040
See yeah, he hasn't been paying attention. All right, let's summon all of our friends again

3344
05:12:11,159 --> 05:12:14,959
Or is that cheating?

3345
05:12:14,959 --> 05:12:19,959
I don't know. It's at least like

3346
05:12:19,959 --> 05:12:21,799
Just get healed at least

3347
05:12:21,799 --> 05:12:23,000
I don't know

3348
05:12:23,000 --> 05:12:26,330
I feel like we should fight the character

3349
05:12:26,650 --> 05:12:28,650
All right, fine

3350
05:12:28,729 --> 05:12:33,099
Too bad. We don't have the music object music is the best in the game

3351
05:12:43,319 --> 05:12:45,319
No, don't kill our killer

3352
05:12:45,709 --> 05:13:04,349
What did she throw dude?

3353
05:13:04,349 --> 05:13:05,630
Oh

3354
05:13:05,630 --> 05:13:19,450
Finish him off. Don't usually use my full power

3355
05:13:19,689 --> 05:13:21,689
Oh, he killed me with it

3356
05:13:21,770 --> 05:13:24,560
I thought he was aiming at you

3357
05:13:24,560 --> 05:13:26,560
Hey, I thought I actually thought he was aiming at you

3358
05:13:27,360 --> 05:13:29,360
Oh shit, we're gonna lose

3359
05:13:29,520 --> 05:13:44,439
Uh, here comes the here comes the throw from the stir

3360
05:13:59,799 --> 05:14:01,639
I think it's freezing

3361
05:14:01,639 --> 05:14:03,639
You're kind of you are jumping around

3362
05:14:03,639 --> 05:14:12,009
Just a couple more hits. You got it. I rolled backwards like a dope

3363
05:14:13,369 --> 05:14:15,369
Okay

3364
05:14:21,290 --> 05:14:27,450
Hey, I got the wait. I have the right side of the uh, howling tree medallion. Do you have the left side? Yes

3365
05:14:27,930 --> 05:14:29,930
I believe so. Okay, we have that

3366
05:14:30,840 --> 05:14:33,000
I I again got three golden seeds

3367
05:14:33,919 --> 05:14:35,500
Jeez

3368
05:14:35,500 --> 05:14:39,740
All the bosses are just spitting seeds out at me. I don't know why that's pretty weird

3369
05:14:41,240 --> 05:14:43,560
Can you can you go over the cap in a randomizer or no?

3370
05:14:43,639 --> 05:14:47,740
Is it just gonna give you the amount that exists in the game? It should only be that amount

3371
05:14:49,340 --> 05:14:55,849
Can you sit at the bonfire? I'm watching the cuts. Okay. Sorry. You're not watching the cutscene. You're just waiting. I understand

3372
05:14:56,810 --> 05:14:57,770
um

3373
05:14:57,770 --> 05:15:01,049
Okay, I am elden ringing loading screen. I'm loading

3374
05:15:05,610 --> 05:15:11,240
It probably looks like i'm hitting like a vape over here. I keep going like I keep going like

3375
05:15:14,080 --> 05:15:19,229
It's a fucking drink container. Oh some hot cider

3376
05:15:26,029 --> 05:15:30,110
My game is in an infinite loading screen. I think okay. No, it actually

3377
05:15:30,509 --> 05:15:31,709
It's this I I fill it up

3378
05:15:31,709 --> 05:15:36,110
I was just worried that it might have like crashed because this is when it like changes the world state because he killed radon

3379
05:15:36,430 --> 05:15:43,659
There's some bonfire out here, right?

3380
05:15:45,799 --> 05:15:48,360
I it's supposed to be

3381
05:15:48,439 --> 05:15:50,840
There's something we might actually

3382
05:15:51,979 --> 05:15:56,939
Hold on do you is does radon have to die for the game to register that?

3383
05:15:57,659 --> 05:16:00,729
No, the cuts everything happened for no crone

3384
05:16:01,130 --> 05:16:02,729
Everything did happen. Okay

3385
05:16:02,729 --> 05:16:08,220
He said you you were in the cutscene, but where is the bonfire then?

3386
05:16:08,619 --> 05:16:13,020
It should be going down here. There's a there's a catacombs down here. I'll get that waypoint

3387
05:16:27,069 --> 05:16:32,759
You spectating i'm reading a comment. I heard you you said that you believe aliens built walmart

3388
05:16:34,650 --> 05:16:36,650
Um, I feel like that's something I probably said

3389
05:16:37,209 --> 05:16:39,209
So, I don't know. Yeah, I think that I guess

3390
05:16:41,709 --> 05:16:48,000
No, I definitely did I?

3391
05:16:48,000 --> 05:16:55,770
Um, I think that miyazaki. No, not miyazaki. He's the guy made um death stranding for a second

3392
05:16:55,770 --> 05:16:57,770
I thought you're gonna say that you you said

3393
05:16:58,069 --> 05:17:05,919
Miyazaki made walmart. No, no, no, it's weirder. Many actually said it who kojima kojima said that aliens did 9 11

3394
05:17:06,599 --> 05:17:18,380
Oh, where are you? Oh, that's right. I forgot about this cave. This looks weird. My game is very unhappy

3395
05:17:18,459 --> 05:17:23,580
I would be surprised if I didn't crash in like five seconds

3396
05:17:25,630 --> 05:17:28,590
I think this when I rest it'll kill you it'll murder you

3397
05:17:29,610 --> 05:17:32,409
And then you're gonna have to go back out into the desert and get your souls from there

3398
05:17:33,639 --> 05:17:39,819
bitch

3399
05:17:39,819 --> 05:17:46,080
DLC leak. Oh, we're seeing underneath iron forge duties. Wait, there is a there's a bonfire out here

3400
05:17:47,979 --> 05:17:53,400
Yeah, yeah, I couldn't see anything you were doing. Oh, I ran to the

3401
05:17:56,729 --> 05:17:58,650
You know, I kind of need to crush your head

3402
05:18:00,799 --> 05:18:17,799
What you are poking out of the ground just the top of your head is okay. I need to go over here

3403
05:18:26,619 --> 05:18:35,709
Uh, can you even agree to that? I can you probably gonna have to do it again though

3404
05:18:37,150 --> 05:18:40,189
Well, i'm saying because it's like a upon fire you don't have

3405
05:18:41,369 --> 05:18:48,439
I get it's there. I can see it. I think because you're the host. This is technically your game. So anything you do I get as well

3406
05:18:49,450 --> 05:18:55,790
Hailed. Yeah, it does it sometimes let's do it again. What's your favorite mobile game?

3407
05:18:57,560 --> 05:19:03,279
right now, uh

3408
05:19:03,279 --> 05:19:15,759
Pintar poker lame let's say it but play it and then tell me say it play it and then tell me

3409
05:19:16,319 --> 05:19:20,430
Say and play and then tell me pine tar poker play it and tell me

3410
05:19:21,369 --> 05:19:31,020
I would love to hear you. I'd love to hear you say that again after you play it. Okay. Okay. Do you like um, yahtzee?

3411
05:19:33,919 --> 05:19:39,279
I've never played yahtzee. Oh, that's another thing. He skipped. Oh my god, dude. You never played yahtzee and elden ring

3412
05:19:44,220 --> 05:19:48,459
Wait, is this like random? Yeah, this is like random enemy battleground. Oh, they keep spawning, right?

3413
05:19:49,259 --> 05:19:51,759
At least they should keep spawning

3414
05:19:55,869 --> 05:20:00,189
All right. I just I gotta pay attention what the hell's going on here. What is that? Is there a giant in here?

3415
05:20:01,560 --> 05:20:05,479
Uh, yeah, I heard the attack on titan. Yeah, he's down. He's down there

3416
05:20:06,520 --> 05:20:12,720
Okay. Well, let's just go to the boss

3417
05:20:12,720 --> 05:20:15,279
There's a lot of shit here. This is a big place if I remember

3418
05:20:15,520 --> 05:20:20,880
Oh, yeah, it's locked by some contraption. Yeah, we got to go up and jump through a window and out the window

3419
05:20:21,040 --> 05:20:23,040
Yeah, there's a lot. This is a wacky one

3420
05:20:23,040 --> 05:20:27,759
This one actually kind of sucks. It's one of the harder ones. I didn't spend my 87 000 souls

3421
05:20:28,319 --> 05:20:33,919
Yeah, I needed to die where we're going we're going back. Oh shit. This poor flower doesn't stand a chance

3422
05:20:35,119 --> 05:20:36,400
No

3423
05:20:36,400 --> 05:20:37,840
I'm just going back to the

3424
05:20:37,840 --> 05:20:55,240
At beginning

3425
05:20:55,240 --> 05:20:57,720
You're gonna feel the cold steel of my katana

3426
05:20:59,529 --> 05:21:01,840
Damn, that's like that's a lot

3427
05:21:01,840 --> 05:21:05,759
When does the the hard cap the soft cap is for uh attributes?

3428
05:21:06,000 --> 05:21:10,360
I believe it's 40. Is it 40 for like strength x intelligence 40, right?

3429
05:21:10,840 --> 05:21:15,180
Either 40 or 50. It's 60

3430
05:21:16,330 --> 05:21:19,610
Oh 40 60 80. Okay. Yeah, six. Yeah, that keeps diminishing, right?

3431
05:21:28,840 --> 05:21:34,840
How's everybody doing good? How you guys doing? How you doing? Everyone doing? Okay. Everyone good on water. Yes. Anyone need any uh,

3432
05:21:36,299 --> 05:21:40,619
Don't need anything that did sound like that. Didn't it like I was the host of a party

3433
05:21:41,099 --> 05:21:45,419
Everybody good you guys good. You need anything breadsticks. We're gonna get you. You guys good

3434
05:21:50,520 --> 05:21:54,119
How come all the shitty enemies are in the path we have to go and they're like not fighting each other

3435
05:21:56,330 --> 05:21:58,330
Um, that's a good question

3436
05:21:58,330 --> 05:22:03,319
This guy is very confused

3437
05:22:04,119 --> 05:22:05,639
Ooh

3438
05:22:05,639 --> 05:22:08,040
That still did a ton of health damage to me

3439
05:22:09,360 --> 05:22:14,240
Are you like a parry guy? Do you like it? Are you like you like parrying? I like parrying a lot

3440
05:22:15,040 --> 05:22:19,759
In any game what game has the best parry? This is a great stir question. I think

3441
05:22:20,400 --> 05:22:24,680
soul caliber

3442
05:22:24,680 --> 05:22:28,520
I that that was such an unbelievable statement. I'm so confused by that. I died

3443
05:22:30,360 --> 05:22:36,759
What what do you mean like what what game has the best parries soul calibers a lot of fucking awesome parries

3444
05:22:36,919 --> 05:22:40,919
But that sounds so interesting to me. I needed to explain a little bit in more detail

3445
05:22:41,639 --> 05:22:46,200
it's always been one of the main mechanics of soul caliber is if you press like any character can press like

3446
05:22:47,119 --> 05:22:51,759
Guard and down or garden up and you have to do the correct parry for if it's a low mid or high or like

3447
05:22:51,840 --> 05:22:56,639
There's characters with special parries that have like if you parry it then you like instantly go into another move

3448
05:22:57,119 --> 05:22:58,639
And it's uh, it's like a whole, you know

3449
05:22:58,639 --> 05:23:02,080
Just built-in system and it's very nice because it's you're like shield lights up

3450
05:23:02,080 --> 05:23:05,680
So, you know the timing for it very well and it makes it nice like when you get it and you feel good

3451
05:23:07,450 --> 05:23:13,369
That sounds actually really fun. Um, all right, but what about not like not multiplayer?

3452
05:23:14,009 --> 05:23:18,650
Just like a like a pve scenario. Well, who what a game has the best pve parry

3453
05:23:19,770 --> 05:23:25,360
Soul caliber two in the labyrinth mode. All right, okay

3454
05:23:26,319 --> 05:23:35,319
No, I I I would struggle to even think of uh, games besides like dark souls

3455
05:23:36,599 --> 05:23:38,599
Well, which from software game has the best parry then?

3456
05:23:43,209 --> 05:23:48,330
Trying to remember how it even worked in bloodborne because you didn't have parries you had like you used your gun to parry

3457
05:23:50,669 --> 05:23:55,470
I feel like dark souls one had a really just satisfying parry

3458
05:23:55,950 --> 05:24:00,599
I'm gonna be wrong though

3459
05:24:00,599 --> 05:24:06,599
I really do like just the general dark souls using the small little buckler. Yeah, and you do this thing you go you go like this

3460
05:24:09,000 --> 05:24:11,000
Yeah, and when you do it you go we

3461
05:24:11,000 --> 05:24:16,750
You make like a noise and it like gets into like noise of the year. We like that, right?

3462
05:24:17,310 --> 05:24:22,439
Yeah, I love that

3463
05:24:22,439 --> 05:24:24,439
Sekiro is uh

3464
05:24:24,439 --> 05:24:28,650
Sekiro is a rhythm game

3465
05:24:28,650 --> 05:24:31,099
It's like playing

3466
05:24:31,099 --> 05:24:38,650
Sekiro have you not have you not played soul caliber you and I played it I think in the same room at one point

3467
05:24:39,290 --> 05:24:40,889
Just like sitting around hanging out. Oh, yeah

3468
05:24:40,889 --> 05:24:43,849
We did it like a pax east when they were like showing a soul caliber four

3469
05:24:44,009 --> 05:24:48,459
Yeah, i'm not I really don't play fighting games. I'm really not into them

3470
05:24:48,540 --> 05:24:55,150
I just I mean some of the ones like I like like smash like i've played it a bunch

3471
05:24:55,389 --> 05:24:56,909
Multi versus is fun

3472
05:24:56,909 --> 05:25:04,990
But like not the the kind of like 2d plane fighting games where both characters are like this and they like are fighting this way

3473
05:25:05,470 --> 05:25:08,189
Well, actually that's multi versus and smash, but you know what I mean?

3474
05:25:08,189 --> 05:25:13,150
It's like zoomed in the camera. It's you know, i'm saying it's like the 1v1 just zoomed in camera

3475
05:25:13,919 --> 05:25:24,279
Yeah, I don't really like to play those. I'm not very good at them non platform statements went together

3476
05:25:24,759 --> 05:25:28,520
No, I I don't like non platform fighting games

3477
05:25:28,840 --> 05:25:34,439
I feel like you need a lot of knowledge to play them. Well, and I just don't really have the time

3478
05:25:34,439 --> 05:25:37,900
I want to give the time to it. Um

3479
05:25:39,049 --> 05:25:46,139
Do you know where the the mechanism is? I know I just I I have never like actually fought one of these enemies

3480
05:25:46,139 --> 05:25:52,569
I just avoid them. Oh, that's cursed and i'm dead

3481
05:25:54,540 --> 05:25:59,790
I forgot they had the curse. I forgot can you res me? Yeah, i'm gonna res you

3482
05:26:00,349 --> 05:26:10,650
Street fighter six. Oh, it's on cooldown. Do you another 20 minutes? Do you like street fighter?

3483
05:26:11,049 --> 05:26:15,209
Are you do you like to play street fighter? I'm interested in the new one and i'm always interested in them

3484
05:26:15,209 --> 05:26:20,330
But i've never really played them a lot. I have to reset but I was gonna say I mean like evo moment number

3485
05:26:23,450 --> 05:26:26,009
I think that shit's cool. I like parries the most in fighting games

3486
05:26:26,009 --> 05:26:30,009
so when you go like to when you're excluding all multiplayer games, you're kind of like

3487
05:26:30,729 --> 05:26:37,470
Oh, you've respawned this motherfucker right on top of me. He's easy. Geez. I was really upset

3488
05:26:39,229 --> 05:26:41,080
My game

3489
05:26:41,159 --> 05:26:43,159
All right, vince mcmahon

3490
05:26:49,369 --> 05:26:55,680
Um, okay, I got it it was it was like right there so when you

3491
05:26:58,279 --> 05:27:00,279
Where the fuck am I going?

3492
05:27:00,680 --> 05:27:05,000
I can't going back to the bonfire. Let's both meet over the bonfire then we can just walk to the boss. Okay

3493
05:27:07,360 --> 05:27:09,360
I'm guilty guilty. Here's fun, too

3494
05:27:09,599 --> 05:27:11,770
I like I like fighting games

3495
05:27:14,520 --> 05:27:18,939
What's the best soul caliber?

3496
05:27:19,900 --> 05:27:26,380
Uh, you're really gonna ask that you're really gonna you're really gonna put me there in that spot

3497
05:27:26,939 --> 05:27:31,099
Um, it has to be two. I found a weapon that you probably are gonna like

3498
05:27:31,900 --> 05:27:36,759
I found the carrion knight sword. It's like just a great

3499
05:27:37,479 --> 05:27:39,950
intelligence weapon

3500
05:27:39,950 --> 05:27:46,560
Uh, wait, what was it carry a knight sword? Oh, yeah. Uh, sure. I want it. I was gonna buy it earlier

3501
05:27:46,639 --> 05:27:52,159
It was in my uh dragonheart shop. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, don't die. You're you're scarlet rod it, you know

3502
05:27:52,240 --> 05:27:54,959
You're you're a little stinky. So soul caliber two

3503
05:27:56,060 --> 05:27:58,759
Yeah, I mean I liked the newer ones a lot

3504
05:27:58,759 --> 05:28:03,000
But there's a lot of things objectively in them that I would feel like a bad person saying they were the best six

3505
05:28:03,080 --> 05:28:09,240
The most recent one is actually also I would I would put like two and six. They're both popped for different reasons

3506
05:28:09,400 --> 05:28:13,419
Really? So the newer one is good. Yeah, it's just

3507
05:28:15,500 --> 05:28:25,259
I don't know a weird amount of support where it gets overshadowed by tekken. I've got soul caliber is slower, right?

3508
05:28:25,340 --> 05:28:27,340
It's not like a

3509
05:28:28,540 --> 05:28:30,540
It's like a looker

3510
05:28:31,020 --> 05:28:37,560
It's a lot slower. Okay, I probably like it if I've really ever how was it compared to like mortal combat because mortal combat is

3511
05:28:38,040 --> 05:28:41,159
Not fast, but it's not really slow either. I'd say

3512
05:28:42,430 --> 05:28:48,029
Generally, it's probably even slower than mortal combat because a lot of the 2d fighters like that like your punch in mortal combat

3513
05:28:48,270 --> 05:28:53,439
Or in like street fighter a punch is like a three frame attack. We're just like it's happening

3514
05:28:54,080 --> 05:29:00,240
He punches but every like the slowest moves in the fastest moves, excuse me in slow caliber are 11

3515
05:29:00,720 --> 05:29:16,349
to like 15 frame range because I was marv versus capcom is like, um, what is that anyways, um

3516
05:29:16,669 --> 05:29:22,080
The problem that I always have with fighting games is especially something like like marv versus capcom for instance

3517
05:29:22,889 --> 05:29:27,259
It's just it's almost I can't really even this is actually going to be probably horrible

3518
05:29:28,299 --> 05:29:33,040
Yeah, depends on how much uh

3519
05:29:34,000 --> 05:29:39,520
Yeah, yeah, dude, you're you're fucking dead dude, um, we don't know we can skip this one

3520
05:29:39,599 --> 05:29:43,840
We don't have to do this one. No, we're doing this one. I need to learn like how this boss actually works

3521
05:29:43,919 --> 05:29:47,520
There is nothing to learn. It's literally just it just spams every ability it has

3522
05:29:48,479 --> 05:29:51,279
Do you have heals because heals actually do a ton of damage to this?

3523
05:29:51,599 --> 05:29:58,830
This is one of those enemies that I feel like they programmed like a bunch of extra moves and they forgot to take them out

3524
05:30:03,840 --> 05:30:09,200
Like this character's move set has like five extra swings that they just didn't delete from like the lines of code

3525
05:30:13,689 --> 05:30:17,290
This is yeah, like a sakiro enemy. You're just supposed to like auto parry everything

3526
05:30:18,090 --> 05:30:24,299
I might be able to do it because I have faith. Yeah

3527
05:30:25,360 --> 05:30:27,369
Can he be parried?

3528
05:30:27,369 --> 05:30:28,490
I

3529
05:30:28,490 --> 05:30:30,490
Doubt it. Who knows maybe

3530
05:30:31,209 --> 05:30:33,209
Timings are also so weird

3531
05:30:35,880 --> 05:30:38,119
And it screeches at you like a fucking child

3532
05:30:39,400 --> 05:30:40,759
everything about it

3533
05:30:40,759 --> 05:30:43,369
there's like the weird pig scream that like

3534
05:30:44,889 --> 05:30:49,040
I could probably do it if I really tried

3535
05:30:49,119 --> 05:30:50,479
it's like a

3536
05:30:50,479 --> 05:30:51,520
but

3537
05:30:51,520 --> 05:30:54,569
It's you you you an o shape with your mouth. It's

3538
05:30:55,849 --> 05:30:57,770
I could do it if I really wanted to

3539
05:30:57,770 --> 05:31:02,409
But I feel like I don't want to wake a bunch of people up like last time. I think I think you're good, dude

3540
05:31:02,490 --> 05:31:05,689
You're really trying to farm the worst sound today. I'm not even

3541
05:31:06,250 --> 05:31:08,729
Worse sound of the year every clip is going to be from this stream

3542
05:31:09,529 --> 05:31:14,330
Well, dude, I played elden ring for two months straight at the beginning of last year like

3543
05:31:15,369 --> 05:31:19,209
30 clips were nominated for stuff. So come on. It's we've been playing it a lot

3544
05:31:24,279 --> 05:31:26,279
Uh, hold on. Let me actually

3545
05:31:26,279 --> 05:31:32,639
Hold on how much faith do I have because I wonder if that heal really is something I should put on right now

3546
05:31:33,279 --> 05:31:46,509
Give me a sec

3547
05:31:46,509 --> 05:31:53,790
You're saying something about like marvel or something. Oh, right right jumped by an evil boss. What is the great heal?

3548
05:31:54,270 --> 05:31:56,029
How much faith is great heal?

3549
05:31:56,029 --> 05:31:58,270
I might ask it for you might ask it back actually wait

3550
05:31:58,270 --> 05:32:01,549
I don't have a cat. I don't have one of the catalysts. I have no idea because my game says zero

3551
05:32:01,869 --> 05:32:10,590
I don't have a catalyst. I can't cast this spell can I I could give you one because I think this actually makes these enemies

3552
05:32:11,369 --> 05:32:15,419
Just completely trivial if you just cast seals with them. I have a dragon seal

3553
05:32:19,259 --> 05:32:25,599
It's like warming stone. I i've never done this or oh, no, I did I did get a dragon seal. Okay

3554
05:32:27,639 --> 05:32:30,590
Okay, so let me um

3555
05:32:30,590 --> 05:32:34,250
Drop a great heal because I might I might I might be

3556
05:32:36,810 --> 05:32:40,009
Just teleport just teleport back here i'm at the boss door

3557
05:32:40,009 --> 05:32:43,689
Why don't you come here because I if great heal might be able to kill this guy in like five hits

3558
05:32:45,400 --> 05:32:50,220
Okay, so why don't you come here and get it because I have to I have to attune it i'm locking back

3559
05:32:50,299 --> 05:32:55,159
No, no, no, no, let's let's just we're fine. Okay. I want to hear that marvel thought

3560
05:32:56,650 --> 05:33:02,009
Marvel versus capcom 2 is so fast that it's almost hard for me to even pay attention to what's happening

3561
05:33:02,889 --> 05:33:07,770
And I feel like the you know what i'm not a big fan of at the soul cali. I don't think so caliber has this

3562
05:33:08,250 --> 05:33:10,250
I'm not a big fan of the

3563
05:33:10,569 --> 05:33:16,169
Zoom the camera in to show like here we go something's happening. I wanted to see what's going on

3564
05:33:16,729 --> 05:33:21,529
Like the here comes a move ring and we go zoom in really close and zoom out. I I want to see the whole plane

3565
05:33:22,490 --> 05:33:28,139
I mean it it it zooms in when you guys stand closer to each other if that's what you're talking about

3566
05:33:29,659 --> 05:33:31,659
How close do I have to be for this?

3567
05:33:38,159 --> 05:33:39,520
what

3568
05:33:39,520 --> 05:33:41,520
This thing that fucking doesn't even work

3569
05:33:44,430 --> 05:33:50,189
He fucking comboed me man, this is not where urgent heal is not an aoe

3570
05:33:50,830 --> 05:33:56,750
Okay, oh, okay supers in marvel where it like yes you go into like super and it like changes the whole screen

3571
05:33:57,599 --> 05:33:59,360
Yeah, it's like

3572
05:33:59,360 --> 05:34:02,080
The camera goes like a close-up of their face or they're you know doing something

3573
05:34:02,479 --> 05:34:05,040
Sometimes I think it doesn't hold another scene off camera

3574
05:34:06,000 --> 05:34:12,490
I actually also hate those the new soul caliber does it and I hate them. I I wouldn't say I hate it

3575
05:34:12,569 --> 05:34:18,279
I just I just not it's it's unnecessary to me. I agree that like I would rather it be

3576
05:34:18,279 --> 05:34:25,720
Like an in-game attack rather than like a cinematic drop a great heal on the ground so I can um

3577
05:34:26,119 --> 05:34:29,000
Equip it later when we die in it literally 10 seconds

3578
05:34:33,819 --> 05:34:42,750
Uh-oh, he's gone. I'm not what am I not dropping it on my screen? You're running in place

3579
05:34:48,189 --> 05:34:50,189
So will this let me see

3580
05:34:50,750 --> 05:34:59,919
No, it's a oh, okay. Yeah. No, no, I'm going back this this this should do it. I waste time. I'll be right back

3581
05:35:02,520 --> 05:35:07,069
Uh

3582
05:35:07,069 --> 05:35:14,619
It is an aoe

3583
05:35:14,619 --> 05:35:17,900
The thing is I like watching people play those games

3584
05:35:17,979 --> 05:35:23,720
I think it's cool because when they when people do their combos and you get it looks like it takes a lot of

3585
05:35:24,500 --> 05:35:28,000
Interesting skill set to do that

3586
05:35:28,000 --> 05:35:41,720
I will never be able to have and it's just fun to kind of watch people that know what they're doing flight get mana

3587
05:35:43,049 --> 05:35:44,490
I'm a big uh

3588
05:35:44,490 --> 05:35:46,490
big soul caliber

3589
05:35:47,259 --> 05:35:50,319
Enthusiast so even that like there's like barely any combos

3590
05:35:51,119 --> 05:35:57,020
I hate games where it's like 16 hit combo from corner to corner, but even that they've I don't know

3591
05:35:57,180 --> 05:35:59,180
It's gotten worse with that over time as well

3592
05:35:59,740 --> 05:36:02,220
How close do I have to be to use this? Does it matter where I am?

3593
05:36:06,009 --> 05:36:07,450
Holy shit

3594
05:36:07,450 --> 05:36:12,729
Jesus. Oh my god. Oh my god. That scared me. It was so ridiculous. Uh, you died

3595
05:36:14,490 --> 05:36:17,209
Okay, so that all right, so I don't have any more mana but

3596
05:36:18,009 --> 05:36:20,009
Uh, I will if we don't beat it

3597
05:36:29,119 --> 05:36:35,360
Oh my god, let me just drink for a second

3598
05:36:38,880 --> 05:36:43,119
It's I feel like i'm playing a fighting game against somebody I was doing comedy i'm sorry

3599
05:36:52,029 --> 05:36:54,430
All right. Yeah, i'm so glad we can kill this guy in two seconds now

3600
05:36:56,540 --> 05:37:01,470
Okay, we're good. Um

3601
05:37:02,319 --> 05:37:06,490
Pass that shit to me. All right. No, you're you have faith, right? Yeah

3602
05:37:06,569 --> 05:37:09,529
What do you mean pass that to you? You you want to be the one that does it?

3603
05:37:10,959 --> 05:37:20,700
Yo pass that shit to me dog. No, this is mine. I'm doing it. All right, let's go

3604
05:37:20,939 --> 05:37:26,639
That's like the most compelling argument i've had to like switch to faith and do the healing fire stuff

3605
05:37:26,639 --> 05:37:30,880
I was talking about just to just get rid of that enemy just delete that enemy from the whole game. Whenever you see it

3606
05:37:31,360 --> 05:37:33,979
Yep. Yeah

3607
05:37:33,979 --> 05:37:41,279
You're losing focus because the mask

3608
05:37:41,520 --> 05:37:49,790
That's good to know

3609
05:37:49,790 --> 05:37:52,029
That sound was so loud too. It was like he got hit

3610
05:37:52,669 --> 05:37:55,310
by a hundred damage abilities in a row

3611
05:37:56,349 --> 05:37:58,349
Not by one singular ability

3612
05:38:04,509 --> 05:38:15,340
I'll defend you my lord. All right, here we go drink

3613
05:38:21,849 --> 05:38:23,930
Wow, I never knew that either that's silly

3614
05:38:24,569 --> 05:38:25,529
I am

3615
05:38:25,529 --> 05:38:27,529
Silly shit. What's amber drought?

3616
05:38:28,270 --> 05:38:44,509
Draught what is this? I've never seen that item. Oh, it's uh, it's the like puppet guy

3617
05:38:45,150 --> 05:38:47,150
Oh, can you give me that carrion knight sword?

3618
05:38:47,630 --> 05:38:49,310
Did you? Yeah

3619
05:38:49,310 --> 05:38:51,000
Okay, i'm

3620
05:38:51,000 --> 05:38:53,000
Not of this reality

3621
05:38:53,000 --> 05:38:56,759
Okay, so you did mention you said hey man, I really want those spells

3622
05:38:57,720 --> 05:39:02,200
You it's 15 faith to use great heal. Are you actually going to put like five points in faith?

3623
05:39:04,220 --> 05:39:10,189
Are you going to yeah, I have to take it off at the bonfire

3624
05:39:22,459 --> 05:39:29,360
Like I from the beginning. I just want it like carrion great sword or something. I think there's a lot of souls

3625
05:39:31,130 --> 05:39:39,819
But uh, nobody's finding it. Do you want them both? I'm imagining you probably do sure

3626
05:39:40,220 --> 05:39:45,720
I'm gonna give you this other thing too. It's just like frenzy. It's a ton of faith

3627
05:39:45,720 --> 05:39:46,759
You're probably never gonna use it

3628
05:39:46,759 --> 05:40:01,479
But your spell guy and it was great heel was the one that hit him great hill is the aoe. Yeah

3629
05:40:04,299 --> 05:40:17,400
Urgent heal I think is just a heals you I think. All right, where are we going? We killed radon. I think the next logical place

3630
05:40:18,279 --> 05:40:19,319
is

3631
05:40:19,319 --> 05:40:29,439
Plateau there's not any major bosses that like is before plateau. Um

3632
05:40:33,979 --> 05:40:35,259
Um

3633
05:40:35,259 --> 05:40:40,540
We're not are you getting runes? Wait, what about the great runes? The great runes are also

3634
05:40:41,340 --> 05:40:43,259
Random so oh

3635
05:40:43,259 --> 05:40:45,500
Is that gonna lock us out of being able to beat the game?

3636
05:40:47,000 --> 05:40:52,680
Potentially, but the merchants do sell hints to like where some items are and if we really need to look there's like a spoiler file

3637
05:40:52,759 --> 05:40:54,759
That'll tell you where great runs can be found

3638
05:40:54,919 --> 05:41:01,319
But I think we could go tries to put them in places where you'll probably find them. Uh

3639
05:41:02,459 --> 05:41:14,569
Knock around is apparently the next logical step so underground or see the plateau go through the capital

3640
05:41:16,380 --> 05:41:23,319
Volcano manor is another one too. Yep up in the mountains. I feel like there's a lot of bosses up in the mountains, too

3641
05:41:23,880 --> 05:41:28,860
Do you want to do the skip to volcano manor from

3642
05:41:29,979 --> 05:41:36,279
Cilia or wherever you know, I mean the oh that enemy is gonna be different. Never mind. We can't do it. Hmm

3643
05:41:36,680 --> 05:41:44,909
What's up to you? I I actually totally forget how you get to volcano manor without doing that

3644
05:41:45,150 --> 05:41:57,930
I wonder if they're on the map

3645
05:41:57,930 --> 05:42:04,250
Is it how do you get to volcano manor normally you have to get the invitation right to like go actually inside of it?

3646
05:42:04,729 --> 05:42:13,500
And do the how do you get to uh, what's his name? Uh, the snake guy rykart rykart. Yeah, you need

3647
05:42:15,040 --> 05:42:20,479
Like walk all the way up the mountain on the it's it's a long travel on plateau

3648
05:42:21,240 --> 05:42:29,770
My toe platy platypus from where you fought the fire giant. Yeah, the mod kept in the volcano skip

3649
05:42:30,169 --> 05:42:32,380
you can go without the

3650
05:42:32,380 --> 05:42:48,200
Wait, it does someone said that i'm gonna give you the uh, quarterback seat here because i'll do anything just probably just looking at the map

3651
05:42:48,520 --> 05:42:59,659
Thinking if there's anything i'm forgetting. Let's just go to the plateau and the npc can tp you to volcano manor

3652
05:42:59,740 --> 05:43:21,580
Really, which waypoint is it to where we were you can still do the lucaria skip apparently. Oh

3653
05:43:22,540 --> 05:43:24,909
Rhea's in the lake. That's right

3654
05:43:24,909 --> 05:43:31,049
The the snake uh, the snake lizard kind of girl. She's in the lake and I think she can tp you there, right?

3655
05:43:35,000 --> 05:43:38,520
I don't know. Is that can we can we actually do that because we could we could just do that right now

3656
05:43:41,709 --> 05:43:51,150
I forget where she's sitting around somewhere here. Right? All right, go to um good place to go probably the

3657
05:43:51,630 --> 05:44:41,119
Laska ruins we'll go from there. Yeah, she's gonna be one of the gazebo buildings. Watch out giant. I'm not following you

3658
05:44:41,840 --> 05:44:44,889
She's in one of those

3659
05:44:44,889 --> 05:44:46,889
Oh, there's a basement here

3660
05:44:47,400 --> 05:45:02,889
Let's do it free shit. Can't go wrong there. Oh freezing grease

3661
05:45:04,650 --> 05:45:11,900
I can respect again or maybe you could because I just got a larval tier. Oh, I already I still have one

3662
05:45:11,979 --> 05:45:17,599
I think I have two

3663
05:45:17,599 --> 05:45:21,790
Uh, all right. You know what? Let's get the map here

3664
05:45:23,930 --> 05:45:27,740
Be much easier

3665
05:45:27,819 --> 05:45:33,389
Uh, why am I fighting this thing?

3666
05:45:40,840 --> 05:45:49,150
Where's the map? Where's the map? I want to freeze frame that you

3667
05:45:49,950 --> 05:46:06,509
Got like photoshop smudge tooled across my screen. What about the typing test? Oh, yeah, i'm kind of tired though

3668
05:46:07,639 --> 05:46:11,959
We need to do that like on a high energy start of the stream. I forgot to do that

3669
05:46:13,259 --> 05:46:15,740
I've been being reminded but like dude

3670
05:46:16,380 --> 05:46:18,380
I want to play elgin ring

3671
05:46:18,540 --> 05:46:20,990
Like like come on

3672
05:46:20,990 --> 05:46:23,869
Yeah, i'm with him. I'm with him now. It needs to be like a fresh day

3673
05:46:24,669 --> 05:46:28,270
You gotta be like fully ready. You gotta prepare. It's true. All right, where's this?

3674
05:46:28,830 --> 05:46:33,549
We need to go to follow me. We need I want the map. I hate looking at the no I got on

3675
05:46:34,970 --> 05:46:37,400
You know what? I mean, I don't like looking at the

3676
05:46:37,459 --> 05:46:45,869
Undiscovered area. I hate undiscovered area sister. I have to ask you this question

3677
05:46:48,430 --> 05:46:49,869
Hi

3678
05:46:49,869 --> 05:46:55,869
Hi, we planned on this. We planned on this weekend being an elden ring co-op stream weekend

3679
05:46:57,069 --> 05:47:04,650
But how do you feel are you you want to keep you want to beat this you want to try to beat the game on randomizer?

3680
05:47:06,250 --> 05:47:09,849
Uh, I mean, I thought i'm i'm still enjoying it. I okay

3681
05:47:10,330 --> 05:47:14,090
I don't know when would be good like when's good like when you want to play again

3682
05:47:14,490 --> 05:47:17,529
What's your schedule look like over the next like this week?

3683
05:47:19,529 --> 05:47:23,450
Weekend again or something just do it and have it be a weekend thing till we do we beat it

3684
05:47:24,990 --> 05:47:27,709
Or you know, you got stuff you got stuff going on on the weekend, right?

3685
05:47:31,419 --> 05:47:35,900
I think if you wanted to play again tomorrow, I could do that and then we could make it a weekend thing

3686
05:47:36,220 --> 05:47:42,220
I cannot play tomorrow. Okay, I think it would be the most responsible thing to do to make it a weekend thing

3687
05:47:44,139 --> 05:47:53,689
Same deal like saturday sunday. Yeah, that sounds good to me. Nice. Okay, so

3688
05:47:55,959 --> 05:48:03,630
Where is her gazebo? Is it this one? Is it this one? Is it this one chat? Give me help here

3689
05:48:04,110 --> 05:48:16,409
Where is her gazebo? They are never playing this again. Yes, we are bottom right this one here

3690
05:48:17,209 --> 05:48:18,409
Why would

3691
05:48:18,409 --> 05:48:24,250
Why would you doubt why doubt they are never doing this again? We're playing so much. We're like not going to the bathroom

3692
05:48:24,330 --> 05:48:28,479
And it's like nine hour streams. I'm like i'm gonna piss but this is fun

3693
05:48:29,200 --> 05:48:32,720
So fun there ain't ever fucking coming back never again

3694
05:48:34,720 --> 05:48:43,080
Uh, I think it's this one. It's the one next to the telescope. Oh, okay. It's this one

3695
05:48:43,400 --> 05:48:45,400
All right, all the way south. It's right next to the bonfire

3696
05:48:57,310 --> 05:49:03,919
Oh, I know I know an area I also would like to do is the uh, we have the waypoint to the underground

3697
05:49:04,880 --> 05:49:10,319
That one mine that we teleported to for the sleepy chest. Yeah, but we like never actually did the mine

3698
05:49:10,639 --> 05:49:14,220
There should be a lot of stuff in there and a boss at the end

3699
05:49:15,240 --> 05:49:17,770
All right. She's in here. Are you are you here with me? I'm

3700
05:49:18,650 --> 05:49:29,880
Not you should probably be here in case the host needs to do something. I'm coming. How far away are you?

3701
05:49:30,840 --> 05:49:33,209
Oh god, you're pretty far

3702
05:49:36,169 --> 05:49:37,209
Okay

3703
05:49:37,209 --> 05:49:38,810
My game crashed

3704
05:49:38,810 --> 05:49:41,130
Oh, no, i'm gonna get teleported out

3705
05:49:43,049 --> 05:49:47,209
I'm gonna not touch anything because I feel like i'm about to leave and it's gonna break the game if I do anything

3706
05:49:56,799 --> 05:50:19,340
Am I gonna get booted? Yes. This is seamless co-op also randomizers as well. Those are the only two things we have on is

3707
05:50:20,540 --> 05:50:35,470
Item randomizer enemy randomizer and seamless co-op. I'm inviting you to my game now

3708
05:50:36,380 --> 05:50:38,729
Thank you

3709
05:50:38,729 --> 05:50:44,430
Thank you

3710
05:50:44,430 --> 05:50:49,470
I did not switch to a faith build. I just put enough points into face so I could use this weapon

3711
05:50:50,650 --> 05:50:52,810
It's a strength weapon, but it is faith

3712
05:50:53,369 --> 05:50:55,369
Same time. I think if I find

3713
05:50:55,849 --> 05:50:57,849
a faith ash of war

3714
05:50:57,849 --> 05:50:59,849
That's like my sign to switch

3715
05:51:00,439 --> 05:51:03,720
Or if I find one of the spells I want it's my sign to not switch

3716
05:51:04,439 --> 05:51:06,680
That's like i'm waiting for either of those

3717
05:51:07,159 --> 05:51:17,240
The diablo style loot mod might be fun. Where am I?

3718
05:51:18,939 --> 05:51:21,369
Yeah, that does seem interesting

3719
05:51:21,369 --> 05:51:25,630
I wonder how elaborate it is. I looked into it and the answer is not very

3720
05:51:26,189 --> 05:51:29,479
No

3721
05:51:29,479 --> 05:51:31,479
Okay, uh, we need to go back down

3722
05:51:32,119 --> 05:51:34,119
Uh, oh it's right here. Okay

3723
05:51:34,200 --> 05:51:46,810
So what does it do? It kind of you pick up an item and it's oh long sword of the eagle and it's just random stats

3724
05:51:46,810 --> 05:51:53,150
On it. I think it's like preset to have ashes of war or like specific types of uh,

3725
05:51:53,689 --> 05:51:57,709
Enhancements on it and it could be like a plus one or whatever. It could just it's like just

3726
05:52:00,110 --> 05:52:02,669
It's read like it was just an extra layer to the randomizer

3727
05:52:04,729 --> 05:52:11,200
Why are you wearing the same clothes from your first playthrough? I don't know. I have

3728
05:52:11,919 --> 05:52:21,040
I don't just like wear shirts and then throw them away. I wash them and wear them again a

3729
05:52:21,599 --> 05:52:26,759
Week or so later. She wants us to go get her necklace back from a thug from a shack

3730
05:52:28,110 --> 05:52:33,630
Yeah, so we gotta go talk to the there's a guy that makes like, um shrimps or something over here. Oh lobster boy

3731
05:52:34,729 --> 05:52:40,250
Yes, let me do this too. What if we kill her?

3732
05:52:41,159 --> 05:52:45,880
That would be bad because that would probably break the game and the whole reason why we're doing this is to make sure we can

3733
05:52:45,959 --> 05:52:48,560
Get to the manor

3734
05:52:48,560 --> 05:52:56,919
Promptly, all right the shack if I remember this shack it's right here chat

3735
05:52:58,110 --> 05:53:00,110
They close in the game. Oh

3736
05:53:00,509 --> 05:53:08,810
Oh, I don't it's randomizer. I don't know. Is it down. It's right here, right? It's like right here

3737
05:53:08,970 --> 05:53:18,319
I think it's this one right here. Yeah, it's right here. I wasn't wearing this earlier. I had the blade

3738
05:53:18,880 --> 05:53:21,180
Helmet on I had this

3739
05:53:21,659 --> 05:53:32,029
Uh, I had this yeah, I looked much different this playthrough. You look cute. I think I think it looked pretty good

3740
05:53:44,240 --> 05:53:46,639
All right questions for stirrer. Did you ever come here?

3741
05:53:48,400 --> 05:53:52,909
No

3742
05:53:52,909 --> 05:53:59,150
Never came here. I have read I like knew all about the shack and what was here and it was like this place is like

3743
05:53:59,150 --> 05:54:01,150
It's all foggy. I never saw it

3744
05:54:01,790 --> 05:54:08,119
I think maybe once I like dedicated to coming here. I feel like you just beat all the bosses

3745
05:54:08,439 --> 05:54:10,439
You just kind of went boss to boss to boss

3746
05:54:12,080 --> 05:54:14,799
I didn't do a lot of the quest lines because they're all so convoluted

3747
05:54:14,799 --> 05:54:18,560
I did like ronnie's this is important like I never want to do that ever again

3748
05:54:18,959 --> 05:54:22,970
How do we not screw this up do we just like what give give me the necklace I forget

3749
05:54:23,209 --> 05:54:33,180
Well, how do we make sure we get to the manor? Well, he's selling an item and it is not a necklace

3750
05:54:35,680 --> 05:54:37,360
You need to ask him

3751
05:54:37,360 --> 05:54:44,060
And he you have to pay him. Yeah, and I go into the shop and he's trying to sell me a laughing smile mask. Okay

3752
05:54:45,599 --> 05:54:48,880
Shit rattling paint. Hello. Okay, I bought it

3753
05:54:50,000 --> 05:54:59,130
Hold on deal fuck

3754
05:55:01,630 --> 05:55:09,240
Okay, thanks for the smithing stone

3755
05:55:09,319 --> 05:55:11,919
I think we broke it

3756
05:55:11,919 --> 05:55:16,569
I mean he I bought I don't know. Does that technically count?

3757
05:55:16,569 --> 05:55:21,450
Does the the quest I don't I wonder if the game is like, oh you bought that thing from the guy

3758
05:55:36,779 --> 05:55:42,490
Kill him. Wait, kill him. He might have it on him, right? He won't have it on him. No, he won't

3759
05:55:48,270 --> 05:55:50,270
Hey, excuse me, sir

3760
05:55:50,270 --> 05:55:57,770
Sir, don't kill him people are freaking out. They're saying don't kill him. Do not kill him. Do not don't don't stir. No

3761
05:55:57,930 --> 05:56:00,680
Uh-oh

3762
05:56:00,680 --> 05:56:04,860
He's came fight. He hit me first. Don't touch my friend

3763
05:56:05,819 --> 05:56:08,619
Even though he's antagonized and he's completely at fault

3764
05:56:12,270 --> 05:56:14,270
Oh, and now you're gonna heal during a fight

3765
05:56:16,830 --> 05:56:19,319
I got plenty in mine

3766
05:56:19,319 --> 05:56:21,319
Oh, it's delicious

3767
05:56:21,959 --> 05:56:23,959
Wish you had more than one didn't you?

3768
05:56:24,040 --> 05:56:34,169
Why did you do that? That was mean. I got the iron ball. I yeah, it's not gonna

3769
05:56:36,840 --> 05:56:39,639
That wasn't I know. I look I participated but he

3770
05:56:41,049 --> 05:56:45,080
What was it? Come on. Is it worse to kill the guy?

3771
05:56:45,319 --> 05:56:50,360
I don't know. I think it drink elixirs over his body to show him like that. You would have lived

3772
05:56:50,939 --> 05:56:52,060
Here's the thing

3773
05:56:52,060 --> 05:56:58,299
But I think we needed that guy alive for for some very important reason. We don't need him. I did like a jokey

3774
05:56:58,939 --> 05:57:04,860
Like oh look, I'm doing a joke you killed the guy you started the fight and that ruined our playthrough

3775
05:57:06,080 --> 05:57:08,080
Our playthrough is ruined

3776
05:57:08,400 --> 05:57:13,400
I guess we're not going to play on weekends anymore. They were right. So what what do we do about this?

3777
05:57:16,090 --> 05:57:23,659
How about we get to the manor and they're like seven other ways that we can do it. All right, that sounds easy

3778
05:57:24,880 --> 05:57:30,380
Oh, wait, okay. I can't buy prawns. I can't buy the shrimps anymore. He doesn't sell them. Yes

3779
05:57:30,380 --> 05:57:34,860
He does. I just bought a bunch of them

3780
05:57:34,860 --> 05:57:38,220
I just bought a shitload of them. Oh my god. These things are amazing

3781
05:57:38,860 --> 05:57:41,900
Yes, he was look the other merchant

3782
05:57:42,779 --> 05:57:45,080
Boiled prawn. Oh

3783
05:57:45,080 --> 05:57:47,959
No, those are huge. I can't believe you

3784
05:57:48,759 --> 05:57:50,840
Killed that guy and taunted and

3785
05:57:52,250 --> 05:57:55,770
All the ball bearing we're good. God damn it, dude. Okay, so

3786
05:57:57,680 --> 05:57:58,619
that

3787
05:57:58,619 --> 05:58:17,080
Randomizer makes that way to do that impossible. So what if we just walk in grabs it better vote try talking to raya

3788
05:58:17,080 --> 05:58:23,279
Anyways, no, she's a snake spoilers

3789
05:58:25,080 --> 05:58:32,250
um, I played an entire playthrough with a snake and it was one of the most loyal one of the

3790
05:58:33,430 --> 05:58:39,259
Smartest and most fun had a lot of fun moments with that snake. What are you talking about?

3791
05:58:39,659 --> 05:58:44,459
I played through my first playthrough. I my first playthrough elder ring was was with the snake spirit summons

3792
05:58:44,459 --> 05:58:53,610
I summed them all the time. Okay, it was that's the you're talking about how raya is a

3793
05:58:54,169 --> 05:58:55,529
Was a snake

3794
05:58:55,529 --> 05:58:56,889
She's bad

3795
05:58:56,889 --> 05:58:59,369
Why is that? She's a bad type of snake

3796
05:59:00,889 --> 05:59:23,069
Okay, she can't be with the other snakes. There's a lot of smithing stones here. Holy shit just empty

3797
05:59:24,029 --> 05:59:30,560
We already got that i'm surprised you could open it again, but we already did that in mod chat. I got something

3798
05:59:30,560 --> 05:59:33,560
Here's the path to the manor

3799
05:59:33,639 --> 05:59:39,599
You gotta move around the mod mods are back seating like you like you were gonna get us there any quicker

3800
05:59:39,840 --> 05:59:48,200
Okay. Yeah, there's actually I have a mod gps here. Let me see if I can look at this in a map

3801
05:59:48,680 --> 05:59:52,759
I need to dude people were telling me the mod allows you to use the teleporter

3802
05:59:53,240 --> 05:59:57,240
Lady at the bottom of the thing with the we could just go that way if that's true

3803
05:59:58,400 --> 06:00:03,919
If you're that committed no, no, no, you're I think you're misunderstanding me like my mod like mod chat like my twitch mods

3804
06:00:04,490 --> 06:00:10,750
I know i'm saying something else. You're not understanding me. We just double miscommunicated with each other. Okay

3805
06:00:11,659 --> 06:00:18,810
No, just once and it was you just the one time you just you didn't understand. Oh, sorry about that

3806
06:00:24,360 --> 06:00:26,009
Is he high

3807
06:00:26,009 --> 06:00:42,060
No, i'm really not. I don't know why I keep doing that because the cave after you

3808
06:00:44,090 --> 06:00:48,250
Bottom of ray lucaria loop around there's a there's a maiden machine

3809
06:00:49,930 --> 06:00:51,049
Oh

3810
06:00:51,049 --> 06:00:54,889
Dude, that's right. I completely forgot about that. Hey, I got a better idea

3811
06:00:55,130 --> 06:01:00,639
I got a better idea. We are going to go. That's what I was saying you

3812
06:01:03,150 --> 06:01:09,389
What ray lucaria at the bottom of the thing you go into the machine and it takes you to the place and at first

3813
06:01:09,470 --> 06:01:11,549
I was like, let's do that and I was like wait, it's randomizer

3814
06:01:11,549 --> 06:01:14,110
We can't do that. The enemy will be different and you were like, oh

3815
06:01:14,750 --> 06:01:17,069
And then someone in my chat was like no in the mod

3816
06:01:17,069 --> 06:01:19,310
It's the same and I said that to you and you were like, oh, okay

3817
06:01:19,310 --> 06:01:28,240
So maybe we can do it. So what are we doing here? There's a fucking boss in the dungeon. Let's do it, bro

3818
06:01:28,400 --> 06:01:38,509
You're not even fucking listening. How come you never listen? I did listen. I just

3819
06:01:39,069 --> 06:01:40,669
I

3820
06:01:40,669 --> 06:01:44,270
I thought when you were saying that I thought you said that it wasn't possible

3821
06:01:44,349 --> 06:01:45,950
So I was like, okay, it's not possible

3822
06:01:45,950 --> 06:01:49,790
Then when we were told it was possible in my mind, it was like why are what are we doing here?

3823
06:01:50,110 --> 06:01:55,639
I thought you were trying to find something here that was like I thought you were abandoning the manor like ah, no

3824
06:01:55,639 --> 06:02:00,090
No, let's fuck that. Let's just do something else. I just want to do this

3825
06:02:00,970 --> 06:02:04,569
I thought but I thought you were abandoning like us going to the manor like nah fucking whatever

3826
06:02:04,569 --> 06:02:10,669
We can't go there. Oh, maybe we can but we can't where was all this backseating from your mods

3827
06:02:11,310 --> 06:02:16,279
When we were trying to find radon, uh, it was there. I just uh didn't look for an hour

3828
06:02:18,409 --> 06:02:26,009
Okay, i'm just being honest I I when I play dude when I play elden ring games that require focus or like don't get hit

3829
06:02:26,889 --> 06:02:30,490
It's it's i'm here and i'm only here and it's the only place that I am

3830
06:02:30,970 --> 06:02:35,290
It's also hilarious that you have like a mod chat and you call it your mod chat

3831
06:02:35,369 --> 06:02:38,409
But it's actually like can you guys tell me how to play this game chat?

3832
06:02:38,569 --> 06:02:40,729
No, no, it's not. No, it is not. No, it's not

3833
06:02:42,119 --> 06:02:46,520
You're talking about one or two scenarios over the course of like 16 hours. We've been streaming this

3834
06:02:47,310 --> 06:02:51,549
I believe that a lot more scenarios have come up and you just don't talk about it like this whole time

3835
06:02:51,549 --> 06:02:55,790
You've been getting hey jeremy you forgot to you need to like upgrade you have a plus five somber stone

3836
06:02:58,009 --> 06:03:02,250
Well, you know and you just act like oh, yeah, but oh you don't you like don't bring up that it was from mod chat

3837
06:03:03,130 --> 06:03:06,169
He ignores us too sad face sad face

3838
06:03:12,909 --> 06:03:15,790
I'm in i'm here i'm in here right now

3839
06:03:16,750 --> 06:03:37,500
I can't

3840
06:03:37,500 --> 06:03:40,220
Did someone accuse you of not being here? Wait, what?

3841
06:03:41,020 --> 06:03:42,139
i'm just

3842
06:03:42,139 --> 06:03:47,900
I'm just saying i'm i'm in here i'm focusing here and if you said something I may not have heard it

3843
06:03:47,900 --> 06:03:50,380
I may have heard it in process. I'm here and i'm fighting

3844
06:04:00,509 --> 06:04:10,060
I hope I can give this to you because I think that's important. I thought that was in the game

3845
06:04:10,459 --> 06:04:13,180
What the fuck is that? There's a guy going to get you

3846
06:04:14,139 --> 06:04:23,080
I can't leave this now leave we're watching sopranos. You guys are always watching sopranos in the mod chat

3847
06:04:23,080 --> 06:04:24,599
Like what is this?

3848
06:04:24,599 --> 06:04:26,599
You guys are on the sopranos kick

3849
06:04:26,680 --> 06:04:28,680
Woke up this morning

3850
06:04:32,700 --> 06:04:34,159
Did you drop it

3851
06:04:34,159 --> 06:04:37,840
I can't it's bound now. Well, wasn't this a fun dungeon?

3852
06:04:38,400 --> 06:04:51,880
It was yeah, I like this place. Okay. What'd you do to my computer?

3853
06:04:54,040 --> 06:04:58,439
I hacked it when I gave you that dot net framework install. You're correct to avoid it

3854
06:04:59,400 --> 06:05:06,509
This is that's like a graphics card artifacting or it's a secret area and that's fucking cool

3855
06:05:11,560 --> 06:05:17,689
That's the graphical error a secret area. Mm-hmm. All right, so let's do the thing we were gonna do

3856
06:05:18,250 --> 06:05:23,209
The thing that I was not ignoring you about the thing that I just miscommunicated to myself in my own head

3857
06:05:23,689 --> 06:05:28,330
That I thought we were abandoning that mission. I looked over at mod chat watching the sopranos

3858
06:05:28,490 --> 06:05:45,360
Nobody wants to fucking help me. Did they get to the part where tony hits the gas tank? I don't know

3859
06:05:46,119 --> 06:06:08,560
Uh, it failed that's from oh, oh, yeah, you're right. I fucked up. Oh, that's right. I forgot that's from when we were

3860
06:06:09,599 --> 06:06:17,639
Was it dead by daylight? Um

3861
06:06:19,150 --> 06:06:23,639
Dying light too. Yeah, I picked the wrong one. We got a classroom

3862
06:06:35,470 --> 06:06:37,790
Not dead by daylight. Sorry dead light

3863
06:06:38,430 --> 06:06:46,569
Daylight dead by daylight dead dead light dying light dead light rising rising light over light

3864
06:06:53,150 --> 06:07:09,610
Fucking game crashed. Okay. Um, i'm coming back

3865
06:07:09,930 --> 06:07:23,360
We're getting extra crashes today

3866
06:07:23,360 --> 06:07:26,639
Is it because we're going deeper into the game and there's more places for errors?

3867
06:07:27,689 --> 06:07:31,770
I have no idea and it feels about the same to me

3868
06:07:32,009 --> 06:08:06,009
I feel like i've crashed a lot more today than yesterday. Come on, please open open, please dude

3869
06:08:06,009 --> 06:08:25,290
You can buy spider-man and fortnight man. Cool spider-man one two or three. I don't know. I

3870
06:08:25,930 --> 06:08:28,889
We I need to win the wrong spot. Where are you?

3871
06:08:29,290 --> 06:08:33,310
I

3872
06:08:33,310 --> 06:08:38,430
Matter doesn't it pull sometimes it pulls me right? Does it pull me where you are?

3873
06:08:39,080 --> 06:08:44,360
Yeah, I feel like sometimes it's not done that it puts me somewhere

3874
06:08:45,880 --> 06:08:53,790
Has it always done that

3875
06:08:53,790 --> 06:08:58,909
Maybe it's because it uh, no, it just like puts me in like a weird spot near you, right? We used to try and

3876
06:09:00,639 --> 06:09:03,919
Be in the same location, but then I realized it didn't matter. Okay

3877
06:09:06,169 --> 06:09:08,330
All right, so we have to get to the very bottom of this shit

3878
06:09:08,889 --> 06:09:19,849
I'm going down. You didn't even do it like a chad like I did

3879
06:09:20,750 --> 06:09:22,750
Oh, you're such a chad

3880
06:09:24,200 --> 06:09:26,200
You're such a chad

3881
06:09:29,470 --> 06:09:31,959
Want to jump off in the midway?

3882
06:09:31,959 --> 06:09:35,400
Uh, i'm jump i'm jumping you're gonna go. Are you doing it?

3883
06:09:39,639 --> 06:09:42,840
Yeah, because over here you get the uh, the secret ingredient

3884
06:09:49,500 --> 06:09:52,459
Oh my god, this is a horrible spot right now

3885
06:09:53,720 --> 06:09:54,919
careful

3886
06:09:54,919 --> 06:09:56,599
I've missed me got

3887
06:09:56,599 --> 06:09:58,520
I got some soft cotton

3888
06:09:58,520 --> 06:10:07,279
Am I dead?

3889
06:10:07,279 --> 06:10:12,159
Oh, I had animation priority. You didn't whose idea was this

3890
06:10:13,959 --> 06:10:17,770
I'm actually really glad we came over here because it's legendary here for me at least

3891
06:10:27,819 --> 06:10:31,340
This actually is something you might want. I know they nerfed it but still

3892
06:10:32,060 --> 06:10:34,299
Spaghetti it's the sword of night and flame

3893
06:10:35,840 --> 06:10:37,840
I do want that you probably want this

3894
06:10:38,720 --> 06:10:42,380
If I were stir, I would probably say give that to me immediately

3895
06:10:43,020 --> 06:10:53,759
I do believe they nerfed it like into the ground though. I feel like I used it

3896
06:10:54,779 --> 06:10:55,740
in a

3897
06:10:55,740 --> 06:10:57,659
Run that I did off stream

3898
06:10:57,659 --> 06:10:59,580
And it was still pretty good

3899
06:11:11,610 --> 06:11:13,610
All right. Is this thing actually down here?

3900
06:11:20,349 --> 06:11:21,950
So what happens if

3901
06:11:21,950 --> 06:11:30,970
It's not down here. It's just an it's just an omega bird

3902
06:11:35,520 --> 06:11:37,959
Let wait, let it kill you

3903
06:11:37,959 --> 06:11:39,959
Wait, wait, wait, let it kill you

3904
06:11:41,040 --> 06:11:44,090
Let it kill you. All right, i'm gonna die here

3905
06:11:44,729 --> 06:11:46,729
Let's see what happens. Don't kill this

3906
06:11:48,599 --> 06:11:56,830
Still saying exile

3907
06:11:56,830 --> 06:11:58,830
Can you like take it? I don't know like punch it

3908
06:11:59,630 --> 06:12:02,270
Oh, it's gonna kill you apparently it doesn't care about me

3909
06:12:03,150 --> 06:12:14,650
I feel like this thing kills me so fast and now I just can't it won't hurt me

3910
06:12:18,560 --> 06:12:20,560
I didn't know that there was more to this area

3911
06:12:21,319 --> 06:12:23,560
He's crushed me in the head over and over again

3912
06:12:28,509 --> 06:12:30,349
Okay

3913
06:12:30,349 --> 06:12:35,720
Did it work?

3914
06:12:35,720 --> 06:12:39,080
All right

3915
06:12:39,080 --> 06:12:43,439
I

3916
06:12:43,439 --> 06:12:45,119
It works

3917
06:12:45,119 --> 06:12:47,040
Let it let it kill you

3918
06:12:47,040 --> 06:12:49,040
Really it actually works

3919
06:12:51,720 --> 06:12:55,799
You just have to die in that area. I guess if the game doesn't really care what kills you

3920
06:12:58,240 --> 06:13:01,840
I lost 17 000 souls. I did but it's worth it because we get to be here

3921
06:13:02,650 --> 06:13:06,409
That's it's not a lot anymore. No, i'm i'm i'm a verb

3922
06:13:06,970 --> 06:13:08,970
A little 72. It's not like i'm

3923
06:13:09,360 --> 06:13:10,650
level like

3924
06:13:10,650 --> 06:13:15,919
40 or something

3925
06:13:15,919 --> 06:13:19,200
I don't mean to like brag or anything, but it's killing me way quicker

3926
06:13:26,169 --> 06:13:28,639
Never mind

3927
06:13:28,639 --> 06:13:31,759
I'm watching you get hit by it, but you haven't been hit in a while

3928
06:13:32,560 --> 06:13:34,560
How are you watching me get hit by it if you teleport it?

3929
06:13:35,479 --> 06:13:37,080
Because you just got hit

3930
06:13:37,080 --> 06:13:39,900
Uh, you just got hit again

3931
06:13:39,959 --> 06:13:42,220
291 damage you can see my you can see the hit points

3932
06:13:42,540 --> 06:13:43,659
I

3933
06:13:43,659 --> 06:13:47,580
I can see your character dying and getting hurt but you're not you're like floating up here

3934
06:13:57,360 --> 06:13:58,240
Hey

3935
06:13:58,240 --> 06:14:07,099
There is the light I can now there's like shadows now. I couldn't see anything before really we're in the manor

3936
06:14:09,340 --> 06:14:11,099
I actually liked this place

3937
06:14:11,099 --> 06:14:16,439
That was cool

3938
06:14:16,439 --> 06:14:23,369
But I mean it makes sense. My element is fire. So I mean, of course, of course i'm gonna like this place

3939
06:14:25,930 --> 06:14:29,389
Um, i'm more of a wind

3940
06:14:29,389 --> 06:14:30,830
Whoa

3941
06:14:30,830 --> 06:14:33,259
That that's a rare item

3942
06:14:33,259 --> 06:14:35,259
You need to do a full quest to get that shit

3943
06:14:48,279 --> 06:14:52,439
Yeah, every time like I hit a wall you also then follow me in hitting the wall

3944
06:14:56,830 --> 06:15:07,099
I don't like it

3945
06:15:07,099 --> 06:15:10,540
Yeah, my my element is fire. My herb is tumeric

3946
06:15:12,479 --> 06:15:13,520

3947
06:15:13,520 --> 06:15:15,520
my animal is

3948
06:15:15,919 --> 06:15:17,919
How do you determine your herb?

3949
06:15:18,970 --> 06:15:23,290
What everyone you like the most the one you like the tumeric is your favorite herb

3950
06:15:28,189 --> 06:15:35,069
Okay, so why would you why did you laugh that made it really weird

3951
06:15:35,869 --> 06:15:39,959
Because i'm looking i'm laughing with somebody said in chat

3952
06:15:42,110 --> 06:15:47,630
Somebody somebody wrote like your favorite herb with a question mark like it was just like what is that supposed to mean?

3953
06:15:47,709 --> 06:15:49,229
It was uh, it was funny

3954
06:15:49,229 --> 06:15:51,400
Okay, uh, did you come? Okay?

3955
06:15:51,880 --> 06:15:53,880
A little we're a little desynced

3956
06:15:54,330 --> 06:15:55,450
We're good

3957
06:15:55,450 --> 06:15:57,450
You made like a bridge of people

3958
06:15:57,770 --> 06:15:59,770
Yeah, you just walk right over them

3959
06:16:17,689 --> 06:16:32,439
Oh some fun enemies, what what? Yeah, there's some desyncing going on

3960
06:16:33,000 --> 06:16:35,000
There likely is

3961
06:16:35,159 --> 06:16:49,080
The boss down here is what is it normally? Is it one of those winged magma lizard? How is it?

3962
06:16:59,930 --> 06:17:01,930
What the fuck are you doing?

3963
06:17:02,250 --> 06:17:07,209
I'm doing it on purpose. Not I just I was gonna I was also doing on purpose like see if you would do it

3964
06:17:07,290 --> 06:17:10,169
So we're like double downing double getting each other

3965
06:17:10,250 --> 06:17:10,650
Yeah

3966
06:17:10,650 --> 06:17:14,810
You were trying to bait me to do it and I was trying to yeah

3967
06:17:14,810 --> 06:17:20,409
But I was trying to make you think that you were baiting me into doing it thus i'm the one that wins

3968
06:17:21,290 --> 06:17:23,849
There's a winner in this situation. Yes, and it's me

3969
06:17:24,569 --> 06:17:29,950
It's so crazy how he won there

3970
06:17:30,110 --> 06:18:01,310
I was right card gonna work. What do you mean? I mean, we might still have to hit it with the spear

3971
06:18:02,029 --> 06:18:06,909
We also might not I think uh, I think randomizer does obey the spear rule

3972
06:18:06,990 --> 06:18:10,990
And it's just anything in that room that room the boss needs to be hit by the spear

3973
06:18:12,139 --> 06:18:31,790
Okay

3974
06:18:31,869 --> 06:18:36,409
Shield crash

3975
06:18:36,409 --> 06:18:38,009
That's a fun ability

3976
06:18:38,009 --> 06:18:40,799
I don't think i've ever seen it before

3977
06:18:40,799 --> 06:18:43,200
You get that with like there's the big spike tower shield

3978
06:18:44,319 --> 06:18:46,880
I was really I was really trying to make it work for a while

3979
06:18:47,599 --> 06:18:51,869
Are you one of those people that try to do a shield build where you just put two shields on?

3980
06:18:53,130 --> 06:19:13,119
I mean everyone's like tried it. Thanks when we make it out of here

3981
06:19:13,200 --> 06:19:16,319
We're still gonna need to loop around the mountain to get inside the actual manor

3982
06:19:17,529 --> 06:19:19,529
That's right. Yeah, that's fine

3983
06:19:19,770 --> 06:19:23,549
It's a fun little jolly adventure amongst friends

3984
06:19:24,189 --> 06:19:27,340
A little bit like a little bit of gallivanting

3985
06:19:28,119 --> 06:19:30,119
Oh, you went her first there pal

3986
06:19:30,970 --> 06:19:32,970
Okay, how do you feel about cilantro?

3987
06:19:33,290 --> 06:19:39,020
everybody asked

3988
06:19:39,020 --> 06:19:43,180
Hey, why bother is kind of how I feel like like why?

3989
06:19:44,139 --> 06:19:47,130
it doesn't

3990
06:19:47,130 --> 06:19:49,130
I

3991
06:19:49,130 --> 06:19:53,529
I don't I don't even know how to i don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it

3992
06:19:54,409 --> 06:19:58,200
This is kind of a mess. I don't we're okay

3993
06:19:58,840 --> 06:20:00,680
Well, this is how it was designed

3994
06:20:00,680 --> 06:20:03,020
Right. It's not like this is out of the ordinary

3995
06:20:03,880 --> 06:20:08,520
Like oh my god, what a tiny little area. This is so ridiculous randomizer another this is like

3996
06:20:08,599 --> 06:20:11,720
Yeah, this is by design you fight this guy in a smaller area probably

3997
06:20:12,520 --> 06:20:16,319
you do

3998
06:20:16,319 --> 06:20:28,840
You actually do

3999
06:20:28,840 --> 06:20:30,840
He's gonna explode

4000
06:20:57,529 --> 06:20:58,650
Ooh

4001
06:20:58,650 --> 06:21:00,650
End it with a flashy move. Oh

4002
06:21:05,240 --> 06:21:15,279
Cracked pot ruin arc by gosh. We've done it

4003
06:21:18,619 --> 06:21:45,000
I know you're desyncing. I've discovered a lost grace over here

4004
06:21:50,599 --> 06:21:52,680
Now like 30 000 that's not happening for a while

4005
06:22:05,290 --> 06:22:14,349
uh, uh, okay, we need to go

4006
06:22:16,080 --> 06:22:20,000
Around the mount. Do you know where you're going because I do you do?

4007
06:22:20,000 --> 06:22:25,599
Okay, but I don't want to go where you're about to go and i'll give you one good reason

4008
06:22:26,360 --> 06:22:32,060
Why is that because there's usually the mariner boss up here and I want to fight it whatever it is

4009
06:22:32,619 --> 06:22:36,720
It's a good point

4010
06:22:36,720 --> 06:22:48,080
Right go north through the canyon and hug the left side. Yeah, he's he's just doing his own thing right now

4011
06:23:03,279 --> 06:23:08,080
Is this part of the fun of elgin ring just going on an adventure and not knowing what lies beyond

4012
06:23:09,680 --> 06:23:13,680
Right over here. There's a giant tree stalker man. Ooh, there is

4013
06:23:14,639 --> 06:23:17,900
Which one is it? Is it the it's the future one?

4014
06:23:18,939 --> 06:23:21,659
That's that's fun. This one actually it really sucks

4015
06:23:24,720 --> 06:23:37,709
Hit me with them. Oh, but you got a fire weapon

4016
06:23:40,220 --> 06:23:44,799
careful

4017
06:23:44,799 --> 06:23:46,799
Oh, you were born for this

4018
06:23:47,919 --> 06:23:51,040
Not if I get stomped on the ground before being able to stand up

4019
06:23:51,759 --> 06:24:16,810
Ah

4020
06:24:16,810 --> 06:24:18,810
Watch out

4021
06:24:21,689 --> 06:24:30,189
It trolled you with it

4022
06:24:32,520 --> 06:24:34,919
I had that and I feel bad that I died

4023
06:24:34,919 --> 06:24:38,279
I feel like a loser that I died but also you died like 10 minutes before me

4024
06:24:38,599 --> 06:24:49,849
Sir, the boss had like 75 health remaining. We go again

4025
06:24:50,569 --> 06:24:57,180
Yes, oh the vibes weren't there vibes are there now

4026
06:24:59,229 --> 06:25:01,310
Yeah, they're really I was kind of like trolling

4027
06:25:08,060 --> 06:25:10,619
No, no shield

4028
06:25:37,040 --> 06:25:39,040
That really not do that much

4029
06:25:43,229 --> 06:26:23,439
Really not even worth doing that. It's like they're hearing my character go

4030
06:26:27,119 --> 06:26:54,680
I'm over it

4031
06:26:54,680 --> 06:27:00,459
No

4032
06:27:00,459 --> 06:27:02,459
Keep pounding your ass into the gravel

4033
06:27:06,009 --> 06:27:15,279
Get away from me

4034
06:27:15,279 --> 06:27:24,459
and again

4035
06:27:24,459 --> 06:27:30,830
And again

4036
06:27:30,830 --> 06:27:34,279
Ooh, that looks cool

4037
06:27:34,279 --> 06:27:41,360
Flashy end probably lasted that'd be worth probably a lot, right?

4038
06:27:43,659 --> 06:27:46,119
Yeah

4039
06:27:46,119 --> 06:27:59,200
I get love work. Okay. That was just the epic combat that I needed to get my blood flowing for our future adventures

4040
06:27:59,919 --> 06:28:04,279
What'd you eat today?

4041
06:28:04,279 --> 06:28:06,279
uh for breakfast I had

4042
06:28:07,799 --> 06:28:11,479
Uh, I had like italian sausages and I wrapped them in naan bread

4043
06:28:12,599 --> 06:28:14,360
Damn, that sounds good

4044
06:28:14,360 --> 06:28:16,590
It actually really was

4045
06:28:16,590 --> 06:28:18,669
Could I could go again? Did you like?

4046
06:28:19,310 --> 06:28:21,950
Peppers and onions or anything like that or just no just straight up

4047
06:28:24,200 --> 06:28:28,360
It was like in a hurry and I didn't have much food and I needed to eat before gym

4048
06:28:28,759 --> 06:28:30,759
So I was like, I don't I don't know

4049
06:28:30,840 --> 06:28:32,840
I'm going with what I got. That's not like

4050
06:28:33,560 --> 06:28:35,959
Like what you'd want to be eating before you go to the gym, but also

4051
06:28:36,520 --> 06:28:37,959
That is what I ate

4052
06:28:37,959 --> 06:28:41,799
Hey, there's nothing wrong with that

4053
06:28:41,880 --> 06:28:44,060
Do you like hummus?

4054
06:28:44,060 --> 06:28:48,139
I do. I'm a i'm a hummus liker. Yeah, because you mentioned naan bread

4055
06:28:49,279 --> 06:28:54,080
Naan bread, I've randomly tried it not that long ago and realized i've been missing out at first

4056
06:28:54,159 --> 06:28:57,759
I was like hummus is okay, and i've kind of had a lot of okay hummus

4057
06:28:58,479 --> 06:29:01,200
And then I got turned on to some like sriracha hummus

4058
06:29:02,330 --> 06:29:07,959
It's really good. Wait a minute

4059
06:29:11,799 --> 06:29:14,080
Run that by me one more time

4060
06:29:14,080 --> 06:29:16,080
Sriracha hummus was the keyword

4061
06:29:18,319 --> 06:29:20,520
Say the first word again

4062
06:29:20,520 --> 06:29:23,439
um

4063
06:29:23,439 --> 06:29:25,439
Say the first word you just said

4064
06:29:25,770 --> 06:29:29,400
I uh

4065
06:29:29,400 --> 06:29:34,200
I will not apologize

4066
06:29:35,240 --> 06:29:39,400
You're a sriracha. It's new to it's new to me and um

4067
06:29:40,119 --> 06:29:42,119
You're a sriracha enjoyer

4068
06:29:42,520 --> 06:29:47,919
Yeah, that's

4069
06:29:47,919 --> 06:29:50,759
That's how it's gonna be said

4070
06:29:50,759 --> 06:29:52,830
uh

4071
06:29:52,830 --> 06:29:56,200
Bro, I gotta go

4072
06:29:56,200 --> 06:29:58,759
I gotta go I got stuff to do later

4073
06:30:00,439 --> 06:30:02,119
Okay, i'm not sure if this is

4074
06:30:02,119 --> 06:30:04,750
Now i'm confused

4075
06:30:04,750 --> 06:30:06,750
I gotta I gotta I think I gotta go

4076
06:30:07,610 --> 06:30:08,569
Okay

4077
06:30:08,569 --> 06:30:11,069
Do you want to end here?

4078
06:30:12,299 --> 06:30:17,979
Do you actually like a sriracha? Oh you'd like a sriracha? I thought at first it was that I was pronouncing it so fucking bad

4079
06:30:21,979 --> 06:30:23,979
Jalapeno's

4080
06:30:25,360 --> 06:30:28,020
I'll take a jalapeno sriracha

4081
06:30:29,759 --> 06:30:33,759
I love sriracha. I i've actually like never had it at all, but I tried

4082
06:30:35,099 --> 06:30:37,099
The hummus and it's very good

4083
06:30:38,139 --> 06:30:41,180
And I have a local local streamer penta also

4084
06:30:41,259 --> 06:30:45,900
I told him I like that his eyes lit up like I have never seen a human being excited before to tell me how

4085
06:30:45,900 --> 06:30:49,340
Much he also loves the heb brand sriracha hummus

4086
06:30:51,819 --> 06:30:53,819
So I think i'm on to something

4087
06:30:54,619 --> 06:31:00,860
I just think sriracha just I think it just tastes like kind of just it's got like an odd flavor that I don't really like

4088
06:31:04,189 --> 06:31:10,830
It's just kind of like I I don't even know what like regular sriracha tastes like I feel like this hummus is probably like

4089
06:31:11,389 --> 06:31:22,400
It's probably not it. Hey, um, I have something you need to look at

4090
06:31:22,880 --> 06:31:24,880
Oh the meteorite staff. Yes

4091
06:31:25,119 --> 06:31:27,119
There's a bunch of snitches in my chat

4092
06:31:28,400 --> 06:31:29,950
Like

4093
06:31:29,950 --> 06:31:35,439
Like we'll get to it. I I would love it if I can also get a meteorite spell

4094
06:31:35,919 --> 06:31:38,560
You know, what's funny to me is I think they're doing that

4095
06:31:39,119 --> 06:31:44,880
Because I think that they're so concerned they're watching both streams and they see me pick up an item that you could use

4096
06:31:45,279 --> 06:31:49,119
And I think they think i'm just a dummy and i'm never going to tell you that I picked this up

4097
06:31:49,119 --> 06:31:50,159
It's going to be gone from my brain

4098
06:31:50,159 --> 06:31:52,880
So they're just spamming you to tell me to give this to you

4099
06:31:53,720 --> 06:32:01,659
Because they know that they could get your attention. So you'll tell me uh is on the ground right where i'm standing

4100
06:32:01,900 --> 06:32:05,279
I walked down to the bonfire

4101
06:32:05,279 --> 06:32:09,439
Stir just picked up a large club

4102
06:32:10,250 --> 06:32:16,200
I did how come nobody in my chat is telling me about this item that I would like every single time

4103
06:32:16,200 --> 06:32:18,200
There's like a strength weapon that's found you go

4104
06:32:18,439 --> 06:32:19,319
Look at this

4105
06:32:19,319 --> 06:32:23,479
And you walk around you swing it like twice and you're like maybe i'll upgrade that and then we never talk about it again

4106
06:32:23,479 --> 06:32:25,479
And then we keep using the weapon that you're using

4107
06:32:26,639 --> 06:32:29,279
I just like don't want to derail vr. Josh literally said it

4108
06:32:29,520 --> 06:32:32,720
Yeah, but I may have been looking over here you got remember for the streamer to see

4109
06:32:33,709 --> 06:32:37,389
What you're saying you have to do it for at least 20 to 30 seconds

4110
06:32:38,200 --> 06:32:41,400
Because if i'm looking over here and it's like club club club club club

4111
06:32:41,479 --> 06:32:45,639
Hey germa, did you pee your pants today poop poopoo? And i'm like, oh this it's gone. It's gone

4112
06:32:45,720 --> 06:32:51,240
I don't see it anymore. I look over and that's not it's not being talked about. Did you pee your pants? You poopoo, baby

4113
06:32:53,479 --> 06:33:00,479
Uh, no, i'm gonna stick with this. Yeah, I know it's not even like a cool large club

4114
06:33:00,479 --> 06:33:03,520
It's just like the most basic caveman wood club

4115
06:33:04,479 --> 06:33:06,479
It's kind of the character i'm playing though

4116
06:33:07,599 --> 06:33:09,599
It's like me strong supposed to be a caveman

4117
06:33:11,520 --> 06:33:16,319
It's the character you were supposed to play not the character you're playing and you were well we're well past that and it's fine

4118
06:33:19,470 --> 06:33:22,189
I mean you're supposed to be me smart and you're swinging around a sword

4119
06:33:23,069 --> 06:33:28,669
Uh an intelligence sword that has magic scaling on it. This is a huge club

4120
06:33:29,209 --> 06:33:35,319
Squished sideways and has fire on it. Okay, but like uh mom says you have to put it down

4121
06:33:39,470 --> 06:33:46,939
Poison get out. Oh, this is a fucking place where the goobs are

4122
06:33:55,049 --> 06:34:08,569
I'm going goob mode. Oh, we oh, okay. We're waiting for you to do that

4123
06:34:09,209 --> 06:34:18,970
Well, I might as well do it too. So you got poison resistance. Oh, I don't have the hat

4124
06:34:19,130 --> 06:34:21,930
I only have the I only have the body you want the whole thing

4125
06:34:22,889 --> 06:34:24,509
Yeah

4126
06:34:24,509 --> 06:34:28,189
I'll be the one who doesn't get poisoned down here. That's too bad because I like the way it looks

4127
06:34:28,750 --> 06:34:30,400
Okay

4128
06:34:30,400 --> 06:34:34,939
Yeah, you'll be back to the wolf

4129
06:34:34,939 --> 06:34:38,139
We look don't worry, but it makes sense. We we look like the two

4130
06:34:38,779 --> 06:34:46,759
Jokey dopey enemies in every like kid's cartoon like I got some ceiling wolves. It's like we drop on you. Watch out

4131
06:34:48,279 --> 06:34:53,759
Ceiling enemies in here. Look up like a bad guy over there. Oh, there is yeah

4132
06:34:55,340 --> 06:35:00,220
Supposed to be the goop. Why am I so always fucking dark here? It's because I rolled

4133
06:35:01,020 --> 06:35:05,040
Oh god, damn it

4134
06:35:05,040 --> 06:35:09,020
Don't roll. I forgot

4135
06:35:09,020 --> 06:35:12,009
Thanks for the starlight

4136
06:35:12,009 --> 06:35:15,529
Did you ever have the coke? Did you have coke starlight? Did you ever try it? It was really good

4137
06:35:17,069 --> 06:35:19,069
coke starlight after the fucking

4138
06:35:19,950 --> 06:35:23,340
The superhero

4139
06:35:23,340 --> 06:35:28,569
No, it was like coca cola cable was it was coke starlight. It was very good

4140
06:35:29,130 --> 06:35:34,409
I don't i'm not a coke. I'm not a coker. Are you

4141
06:35:35,130 --> 06:35:36,889
You're probably you

4142
06:35:36,889 --> 06:35:39,849
If you were to drink like a cola, would you was it like pepsi or?

4143
06:35:40,650 --> 06:35:42,970
If I were to drink a cola, I honestly wouldn't be

4144
06:35:43,610 --> 06:35:48,779
Okay, well here's something that you really want because this is one of my favorite abilities in the whole game

4145
06:35:51,479 --> 06:35:57,130
I genuinely mean that I love that move. It's like my favorite spell ice quag

4146
06:35:57,610 --> 06:36:02,569
Okay, that like ice glint stone kind of beam thing. They're like chew chew chew. That's probably my favorite spell

4147
06:36:02,810 --> 06:36:15,930
It's very fun. I just got a somber six. Uh-huh. What are you giggling at over there?

4148
06:36:17,209 --> 06:36:19,209
coke heads in chat fuming

4149
06:36:20,110 --> 06:36:22,750
I don't know the word coke heads kind of had me laughing

4150
06:36:25,400 --> 06:36:29,479
I used to be I used to not drink a lot of soda. Well, I drank a lot of soda before

4151
06:36:30,279 --> 06:36:31,849
but

4152
06:36:31,849 --> 06:36:34,330
Like in recent years elastic five years

4153
06:36:34,889 --> 06:36:38,330
I haven't really been drinking it that much. I'm not an enemy. I might look like one

4154
06:36:40,029 --> 06:36:41,150
um

4155
06:36:41,150 --> 06:36:45,000
But the little tiny little cans

4156
06:36:45,479 --> 06:36:54,479
They're like a nice little treat like a nice little dessert. I don't drink a full soda anymore

4157
06:36:55,930 --> 06:37:02,970
Kind of a little it kind of sits in me like a nice little dessert

4158
06:37:04,220 --> 06:37:08,270
I'm not too much of a carbonated man myself

4159
06:37:10,110 --> 06:37:15,319
Everyone smile, you know, you never really go for one. He's lying

4160
06:37:20,279 --> 06:37:22,279
Germa's lying. Why would he goes hard?

4161
06:37:23,119 --> 06:37:28,000
You've seen the cans I drink out of on stream. I've been you've seen them like over the last month or two

4162
06:37:34,830 --> 06:37:36,430
I didn't think that thing was dead

4163
06:37:36,430 --> 06:37:41,130
I thought it was gonna blow up. I kind of did too and i'm gonna die if I don't

4164
06:37:41,689 --> 06:37:48,139
Feel oh, that's right. I did try that weird milk and

4165
06:37:49,099 --> 06:37:52,779
It's supposed to be milk and pepsi, but um

4166
06:37:53,819 --> 06:37:55,900
This should this thing is probably good for you

4167
06:37:59,560 --> 06:38:01,689
Is it good for you?

4168
06:38:01,689 --> 06:38:07,689
Golden order seal. I'll take it. It's into and faith

4169
06:38:08,409 --> 06:38:17,869
So I think this it's fundamental, uh incantations. Yeah, i'll take it. I don't want to equip it

4170
06:38:28,439 --> 06:38:32,919
They discard really should not be right next to leave. I feel like it should be like two

4171
06:38:33,479 --> 06:38:42,439
Rungs down on the menu ladder. I feel like they should make the word delete but you know, where's that dlc?

4172
06:38:43,000 --> 06:38:51,240
Where's that dlc? Hey, look I was one of those people that said man no dlc. What's going on here?

4173
06:38:52,779 --> 06:38:54,720
Look at this game

4174
06:38:54,720 --> 06:39:00,060
This game already feels like it has 10 pieces of dlc on it. That is true

4175
06:39:01,229 --> 06:39:05,310
Like I feel like this if you told me that this game that I have here was like four dlcs were on it

4176
06:39:11,869 --> 06:39:14,029
You that is you're murdering them

4177
06:39:14,669 --> 06:39:20,330
This is very good here

4178
06:39:20,330 --> 06:39:22,330
But I kind of can't see

4179
06:39:26,459 --> 06:39:34,509
I got my guy. I got my guy. You got your guy

4180
06:39:35,639 --> 06:39:42,299
I mean i'm working on it

4181
06:39:42,299 --> 06:39:44,299
What is normally down here?

4182
06:39:44,299 --> 06:39:51,900
I feel like that's normally down here. Am I crazy or is that actually down here? I don't remember

4183
06:39:58,009 --> 06:40:00,009
It's two random bug guys

4184
06:40:00,490 --> 06:40:02,490
Oh, it's yeah with the oh

4185
06:40:04,430 --> 06:40:07,080
You know what I mean the bug guys bug guys

4186
06:40:07,479 --> 06:40:11,560
They're like the shrimp bugs and they have the things that porcupine things that

4187
06:40:13,159 --> 06:40:17,020
Clean rotten nights the game crashed. No

4188
06:40:21,310 --> 06:40:23,709
I think I think you crashed it when you made that noise

4189
06:40:30,080 --> 06:40:32,159
They confirm the dlc by saying they're not done with the game

4190
06:40:32,560 --> 06:40:32,799
Yeah

4191
06:40:32,799 --> 06:40:37,520
But they can take as much time as they want like like look at this fucking game like this so

4192
06:40:38,240 --> 06:40:48,349
We're so spoiled rotten by how this base game was I said it before finishing the first playthrough

4193
06:40:49,150 --> 06:40:51,419
But

4194
06:40:51,419 --> 06:40:54,060
I mean this game the how long did your first playthrough take?

4195
06:40:54,060 --> 06:40:56,459
I know you may have like skipped some optional stuff

4196
06:40:56,459 --> 06:41:01,919
But it took me more than 100 hours to just do the just play through it normally. I was like 120

4197
06:41:02,080 --> 06:41:12,520
Yeah, every other from software game took me somewhere between like 40 to 60 hours. I put my invitation down

4198
06:41:19,590 --> 06:41:34,169
150 took me 200 hours 50 hours, but I was google gaming

4199
06:41:34,569 --> 06:41:40,240
That's an interesting way to say google game. Maybe you just kind of followed a kind of a guide or something

4200
06:41:42,029 --> 06:41:51,450
Google google gaming. I like that actually I should take this off

4201
06:42:02,459 --> 06:42:05,340
My load's a little too heavy

4202
06:42:05,340 --> 06:42:11,630
Maybe maybe by a little i'm a bit of a baby boy

4203
06:42:19,020 --> 06:42:21,470
Still medium, right?

4204
06:42:21,470 --> 06:42:27,959
It's heavy

4205
06:42:27,959 --> 06:42:30,279
Heavy heavy heavy heavy medium

4206
06:42:31,159 --> 06:42:35,520
I have lipstick

4207
06:42:35,520 --> 06:42:37,520
Now i'm pretty cool looking

4208
06:42:37,520 --> 06:42:42,810
Let's continue

4209
06:42:42,810 --> 06:42:51,790
All right, do I have a headache from that green screen car game?

4210
06:42:54,299 --> 06:42:56,060
from like a like a

4211
06:42:56,060 --> 06:42:58,060
Like five days ago

4212
06:42:58,139 --> 06:43:03,389
Hey, just because it was five days ago doesn't mean he watched it five days ago. Oh, that's right

4213
06:43:05,439 --> 06:43:08,000
Yeah, the game was out of control

4214
06:43:13,360 --> 06:43:15,360
Maybe he has had a headache for five days

4215
06:43:16,000 --> 06:43:22,060
That fucking car game. Oh, no, it was backwards. Uh, we need to go north through this tunnel, right?

4216
06:43:23,389 --> 06:43:25,950
Right mod chat mod helpers

4217
06:43:29,680 --> 06:43:32,400
No, this can't be backwards because we're gonna pick that up

4218
06:43:32,959 --> 06:43:48,909
That's gary. Yeah, we're this right way. That's gary's castle. Whoa, take this too. This is another one of my favorite moves

4219
06:43:49,389 --> 06:43:52,590
We're just getting all my favorite spells

4220
06:43:52,590 --> 06:43:55,869
I was gonna say a second ago every single time you like find an item

4221
06:43:55,950 --> 06:43:59,389
You're like, uh, you're either this is one of my favorite spells or uh, isn't it?

4222
06:43:59,389 --> 06:44:00,110
Oh, hey, wait guys

4223
06:44:00,110 --> 06:44:02,110
Isn't this one like one of the most strong ones in the game?

4224
06:44:04,330 --> 06:44:08,650
Like every weapon is the strongest weapon in the game pick this up this thing's actually this thing i'm telling you it's good

4225
06:44:09,209 --> 06:44:14,349
This is a joke item. It's not a joke item. I'm telling you right now. That is I promise you

4226
06:44:15,069 --> 06:44:20,830
That's the uh, like i'll find fun. Thank you. Finally. Well, finally this is one of my favorites in the game

4227
06:44:21,959 --> 06:44:23,959
I've just won it like an actual sword

4228
06:44:24,279 --> 06:44:29,639
Sorcery like for the whole game dare you mock me in front of all of my

4229
06:44:30,680 --> 06:44:34,200
viewers

4230
06:44:34,279 --> 06:44:38,680
They held me in such high regard before you opened your mouth

4231
06:44:42,939 --> 06:44:47,610
That was a kind of i've never heard you do that voice before i'm a bit of a psycho

4232
06:44:48,250 --> 06:44:56,729
Now here's the real question will the actual super ultra

4233
06:44:57,770 --> 06:45:00,090
Comet ability beyond this guy

4234
06:45:01,290 --> 06:45:05,610
When we go do it over here, probably not

4235
06:45:06,840 --> 06:45:08,840
Sorry, wait, does that weapon count?

4236
06:45:09,560 --> 06:45:13,319
As an ice like a moon magic that is moon magic

4237
06:45:15,020 --> 06:45:17,130
It does count

4238
06:45:17,130 --> 06:45:21,209
I um, I should give this to you. Do you have that? Do you have the hat?

4239
06:45:22,029 --> 06:45:24,909
What hat? No, I don't well then take it. He's stirring

4240
06:45:24,909 --> 06:45:28,669
You're essentially gonna be playing the character I was playing as when I played through the game

4241
06:45:29,659 --> 06:45:31,659
I'm gonna switch on I need to respect

4242
06:45:32,139 --> 06:45:34,569
Uh, let me get it this thing

4243
06:45:34,970 --> 06:45:38,349
Boosts um sorceries, right? Yeah, it does

4244
06:45:41,500 --> 06:45:47,740
Yeah, you're slowly turning into the character. I I did that ice glint stone and this uh moon sword essentially the entire game

4245
06:45:48,139 --> 06:45:54,540
I like hate this hat. Do you want to do more damage or do you want to complain about how it looks on you?

4246
06:45:56,619 --> 06:46:00,189
I think I might complain. I really hate it

4247
06:46:03,759 --> 06:46:11,130
But is it worth losing like how much percent like 10 15 more damage? I think it might be more than that

4248
06:46:11,369 --> 06:46:18,889
I look like a fucking rug you can catch it rains. You'd be fine

4249
06:46:24,279 --> 06:46:31,419
This is a good hat, how is that? Okay you

4250
06:46:32,220 --> 06:46:34,779
It's the same hat just it's different

4251
06:46:35,659 --> 06:46:38,139
It's the same but different. It's the same hat that they

4252
06:46:38,779 --> 06:46:43,180
That's in the same world of hats that would be sold at the same store

4253
06:46:43,180 --> 06:46:48,919
The other one was in the the fucking the profile the shape the actual shape

4254
06:46:49,080 --> 06:46:53,319
Like how tall and droopy and lame you can't even see your eyes are covered

4255
06:46:53,319 --> 06:46:58,040
You're an anime character. You don't actually need functionality this one. You got a mask. You have full clear vision

4256
06:46:58,360 --> 06:47:01,560
It's definitely blocking your head from the sun and it doesn't go excessively high

4257
06:47:01,560 --> 06:47:15,200
It's just just enough to cover your head same hat. Oh, yeah, but does that one?

4258
06:47:15,759 --> 06:47:20,380
Oh hell, wait, hold on. Would that one make you punch the punch machine?

4259
06:47:21,220 --> 06:47:25,080
15 harder and get an even higher score as it's you still don't want it

4260
06:47:25,560 --> 06:47:28,279
I don't need a higher score because I already had the highest score of everyone

4261
06:47:29,400 --> 06:47:36,909
What if somebody comes over and beats it? It ain't gonna be you you better shut your mouth. You don't know that

4262
06:47:39,689 --> 06:47:47,340
I wasn't even fucking looking at the game get them get them guys. I was just like I was just seeing what was going on over here

4263
06:47:47,659 --> 06:47:53,439
Okay, what do you what? I don't what do you want me to do? I had 25,000 ruins, too

4264
06:47:53,759 --> 06:47:58,720
Here's what I want you to do. I want you to just pick whatever you feel like playing with and let's play

4265
06:47:59,290 --> 06:48:02,409
I just want you to fucking die. Did you rest?

4266
06:48:03,290 --> 06:48:08,590
No

4267
06:48:08,590 --> 06:48:12,270
Why don't you just fall over you got killed by a snowman?

4268
06:48:12,990 --> 06:48:14,990
It really is a snowman

4269
06:48:26,400 --> 06:48:32,400
There's a magma worm in the lava. There's a big lava pool somewhere where the manor is, right?

4270
06:48:32,959 --> 06:48:34,959
I wonder what's over there this time

4271
06:48:36,299 --> 06:48:39,819
Oh lava and more lava

4272
06:48:40,540 --> 06:48:48,200
This guy's really fucking pissing me off right now

4273
06:48:55,630 --> 06:48:57,840
That's a fake dragon

4274
06:48:57,840 --> 06:49:01,419
That is a fake dragon

4275
06:49:01,419 --> 06:49:02,299
Okay

4276
06:49:02,299 --> 06:49:07,419
So we need to hug the left wall. So we gotta go this way. That's what I was told specifically by

4277
06:49:08,060 --> 06:49:08,939
me

4278
06:49:08,939 --> 06:49:12,779
As I figured it up a good job on figuring this out

4279
06:49:17,000 --> 06:49:20,439
You have no right to talk shit about people's hats when you're wearing a cereal bowl on your head

4280
06:49:26,939 --> 06:49:29,979
I like all these hats. I'm saying they're all cool

4281
06:49:31,360 --> 06:49:33,360
Yeah, I was the one saying I didn't like a hat

4282
06:49:33,840 --> 06:49:39,849
So what's over here because there's a boss over here. Oh, it's a boat nice

4283
06:49:44,810 --> 06:49:48,729
Uh, that's gonna be interesting. Yeah, he's got a fucking lava boat

4284
06:49:50,080 --> 06:49:55,240
Okay, how long can the horse be in here? Um, actually kind of a decent amount of time

4285
06:49:55,959 --> 06:49:59,310
Yeah, lava does very little damage in this game

4286
06:50:00,189 --> 06:50:02,560
Oh god, that's a lot of guys

4287
06:50:02,720 --> 06:50:16,540
smithing stone five

4288
06:50:16,619 --> 06:50:22,479
Can we like convince him to move over here or something?

4289
06:50:23,580 --> 06:50:26,779
He wasn't moving

4290
06:50:26,860 --> 06:50:30,060
Try and convince him as you might as you may just stand over here

4291
06:50:30,779 --> 06:50:33,099
It probably slowly row over here it comes

4292
06:50:37,369 --> 06:50:40,090
Like a wheelchair you can't we're trying to trick him

4293
06:50:41,580 --> 06:50:44,380
You can't row over here. This is land

4294
06:50:45,720 --> 06:50:48,040
Oh, what did you boys want me to do over?

4295
06:50:49,639 --> 06:51:33,209
What are you doing over here don't splash me don't splash me he's going back in the fucking lava

4296
06:51:56,110 --> 06:52:00,110
I was I was actually respecting the lava on the ground and trying to not walk into it again

4297
06:52:00,270 --> 06:52:03,069
Oh, really? Sorry. I was like, oh yeah lava on the brain

4298
06:52:03,869 --> 06:52:06,319
not

4299
06:52:06,319 --> 06:52:09,040
That's my gamer brain my sleepy gamer brain

4300
06:52:10,729 --> 06:52:12,400
uh

4301
06:52:12,400 --> 06:52:16,400
Alexander is over there usually right at this point in the game. Well, we didn't do any of his quest but

4302
06:52:18,830 --> 06:52:26,439
I don't know. What is this area? Never heard of it. Is this elden ring?

4303
06:52:27,580 --> 06:52:29,580
Would alexander still be here?

4304
06:52:30,729 --> 06:52:32,729
No, I don't I think we actually have to do is um

4305
06:52:34,250 --> 06:52:36,430
You see him before this

4306
06:52:36,430 --> 06:52:39,740
Um, I think that was the smithing stone. I need it

4307
06:52:40,139 --> 06:52:45,580
I'm going to eat one of these for the first time I think ever in the hundreds of hours. I've played this game

4308
06:52:46,220 --> 06:52:48,220
The roa. Yeah the fruit

4309
06:52:48,779 --> 06:52:49,979
Where is it?

4310
06:52:49,979 --> 06:52:55,340
I don't even know what it looks like. Okay. Here it is. Wait

4311
06:52:57,119 --> 06:52:59,479
What's the thing that you feed to the horse?

4312
06:52:59,479 --> 06:53:03,450
Roa berry

4313
06:53:03,450 --> 06:53:08,169
You have to craft it. Oh shit. Okay. Oh, yeah, you do have to like craft it from those berries

4314
06:53:17,720 --> 06:53:19,479
Make it oh

4315
06:53:19,479 --> 06:53:22,360
I was like actually so nervous to hear that loud sound

4316
06:53:23,159 --> 06:53:35,259
How do you feel about the crafting in this game?

4317
06:53:35,580 --> 06:53:39,020
Uh, I feel like it did not need to be in the game. I feel like it is

4318
06:53:40,139 --> 06:53:42,220
It I don't think it matters at all

4319
06:53:45,400 --> 06:53:47,959
And not I it's it's upgrade time for me

4320
06:53:48,680 --> 06:53:50,520
I believe it is for me, too

4321
06:53:50,520 --> 06:53:55,599
Let's get a bonfire and go upgrade time. It's a really interesting

4322
06:53:56,319 --> 06:53:59,520
Mechanic to put in and it's just it's just more shit to do

4323
06:54:00,240 --> 06:54:03,840
It's just more fun stuff to do but I I haven't I don't really use it

4324
06:54:03,919 --> 06:54:06,240
I don't really some of the pot stuff is cool

4325
06:54:06,639 --> 06:54:12,080
Oh craft this craft some of the the grease and stuff, right? But for the most part I left it completely alone

4326
06:54:13,599 --> 06:54:17,919
Um, I just really feel like they're only useful in the areas where it's like this enemy

4327
06:54:18,139 --> 06:54:25,159
Insta dies if you throw this type of pot at it. Yeah, it's a great talisman for here

4328
06:54:32,860 --> 06:54:36,860
Yeah early on I tried to do like a bow playthrough and I got a whole bunch of poison arrows

4329
06:54:37,020 --> 06:54:39,340
I spent like 20 000 souls

4330
06:54:40,220 --> 06:54:42,540
Like early in the game to get a bunch of poison arrows

4331
06:54:43,419 --> 06:54:46,619
And I used 80% of them to kill like one mini boss

4332
06:54:49,470 --> 06:54:51,130
So

4333
06:54:51,130 --> 06:54:53,130
That's how I feel

4334
06:54:53,130 --> 06:54:56,729
Rom software really has had sort of a weird relationship with bows in all their games, haven't they?

4335
06:54:58,520 --> 06:55:03,639
They seem to want to make them cool and make them work, but it always seems that they're just not quite good enough

4336
06:55:06,119 --> 06:55:08,119
They need to commit to like a mana system

4337
06:55:08,439 --> 06:55:19,259
Instead of actually having to be consumables because otherwise you could you could have anywhere between one and like 9 000 arrows to use

4338
06:55:19,819 --> 06:55:28,540
Where magic is like limited? It does work as a kind of a secondary though

4339
06:55:28,700 --> 06:55:30,700
If you if you're already doing decks

4340
06:55:31,020 --> 06:55:37,020
And oh i'm gonna do like a bow a short bow with my off hand or something it it you can use it

4341
06:55:37,340 --> 06:55:43,290
But not as like a main weapon to play through the game with and like i'm going to use this and this is the weapon i'm using

4342
06:55:43,930 --> 06:55:49,849
But it's weird they they put up like every game they put a little bit more development into what bows are like there's like

4343
06:55:49,930 --> 06:55:55,049
Uh radon has like a great bow that has like a special bow effects in it and they're all just super bad

4344
06:56:00,159 --> 06:56:03,520
The great bows were actually kind of good in this game just for like knocking things down

4345
06:56:06,349 --> 06:56:10,509
Ali you still make it work though if you really wanted to

4346
06:56:13,340 --> 06:56:19,630
They even added all the the animations and the weapon arts and stuff, right? Yep. So, I mean, it's cool

4347
06:56:20,889 --> 06:56:22,490
It's it's a cool thing

4348
06:56:22,490 --> 06:56:30,540
Oh my goodness

4349
06:56:30,540 --> 06:56:32,540
This guy is just flailing around

4350
06:56:35,290 --> 06:56:36,169
uh

4351
06:56:36,169 --> 06:56:37,610
Do we miss a grace?

4352
06:56:37,610 --> 06:56:41,200
I don't think so. I think it's if we just ran further

4353
06:56:41,919 --> 06:56:46,319
I think there is a boss usually on this road. The um, the giant putrid slob

4354
06:56:47,400 --> 06:56:50,619
Would be up here

4355
06:56:50,619 --> 06:56:54,000
That is actually a great name for a boss. I'm about to respawn everything

4356
06:56:54,959 --> 06:56:57,139
I'm about to save that for myriad

4357
06:56:57,860 --> 06:56:59,860
the great putrid

4358
06:57:00,740 --> 06:57:07,540
I don't know the giant the great putrid slob, you know the great what did I say the great putrid slob?

4359
06:57:07,939 --> 06:57:19,299
That's a great name demihuman queen urn tree the great putrid slob

4360
06:57:21,740 --> 06:57:23,740
And his crab friend

4361
06:57:27,490 --> 06:57:29,490
You up here. I leveled up

4362
06:57:30,400 --> 06:57:36,639
What you what I I literally went to go level I have 50 000 souls man if I I don't want to die here

4363
06:57:37,119 --> 06:57:41,520
You think i'm gonna I got 50 000 souls. Do you think i need an update on what you're doing?

4364
06:57:41,599 --> 06:57:45,520
Yeah, you think we're gonna take on the great putrid slob without me leveling up once

4365
06:57:46,659 --> 06:57:48,259
What if I die?

4366
06:57:48,259 --> 06:57:52,290
Look at all this bullshit here

4367
06:57:53,779 --> 06:57:55,860
Look at all this. This is a fucking mess

4368
06:57:56,979 --> 06:57:58,979
he

4369
06:57:58,979 --> 06:58:00,900
Oh my god, come on

4370
06:58:00,900 --> 06:58:02,900
Yeah, having fun fighting it alone

4371
06:58:04,500 --> 06:58:07,939
I I mean I got I got squished in between everything but

4372
06:58:08,580 --> 06:58:11,650
Did you leave?

4373
06:58:11,650 --> 06:58:17,419
I was fighting stuff up on the hill. I just wanted to just do the big explosion and get it on camera

4374
06:58:23,259 --> 06:58:28,770
I'm not sitting down

4375
06:58:29,490 --> 06:58:31,490
The great putrid slob

4376
06:58:34,380 --> 06:59:01,299
Also known as the dung eater use your pistol

4377
06:59:02,240 --> 06:59:05,090
What?

4378
06:59:05,090 --> 06:59:08,049
Weren't you just like super excited that you found like an m16 or something?

4379
06:59:09,009 --> 06:59:10,209
I

4380
06:59:10,209 --> 06:59:18,060
Swear

4381
06:59:18,060 --> 06:59:20,779
Why is he following me around this house?

4382
06:59:21,659 --> 06:59:42,880
The word slob is I that's actually one of my favorite words. I think in the dictionary

4383
06:59:43,680 --> 06:59:45,680
Uh, you fucking slob

4384
06:59:46,159 --> 06:59:51,970
It has so much meaning but it's like so much force behind it

4385
07:00:00,240 --> 07:00:02,240
If somebody calls you a slob

4386
07:00:03,200 --> 07:00:09,220
It's like hey, whoa, dude, what the fuck? Come on. Like what do you mean? I'm a slob

4387
07:00:10,720 --> 07:00:14,240
I don't know. I feel like someone calls you a slob. It's like hey, you got me there

4388
07:00:14,799 --> 07:00:19,840
To me, that's like there's something I got to figure out why you just called me that like something disgusting is around me

4389
07:00:20,000 --> 07:00:22,000
Something is gross

4390
07:00:22,979 --> 07:00:27,779
Like I am disgusting you somehow for you to use the term slob

4391
07:00:29,389 --> 07:00:38,259
Well, yeah, that's why you're the great grotesque slob like if you had like a dirty room or something

4392
07:00:38,340 --> 07:00:42,099
Somebody came in and said hey clean your room. You fucking slob. It's like

4393
07:00:43,860 --> 07:00:45,060
Ow

4394
07:00:45,060 --> 07:00:47,060
It's a power word. That's hey

4395
07:00:51,779 --> 07:00:53,360
Okay

4396
07:00:53,360 --> 07:01:00,110
Come talk come talk over here. Let's see what you get. What the fuck is this?

4397
07:01:05,220 --> 07:01:07,380
I swear I played a lot of this game

4398
07:01:08,750 --> 07:01:10,750
It won't talk. What talk?

4399
07:01:12,049 --> 07:01:17,840
Wait, you have to bring something here. I got an item. What'd you get? I got a stone sword key

4400
07:01:18,319 --> 07:01:24,479
Yeah, that's not what is this like a rock normally what the this is this is where you get comet azure that like

4401
07:01:25,599 --> 07:01:31,500
The kamehameha thing you wanted. Oh, this is where you get azure, but that's not what you got

4402
07:01:34,610 --> 07:01:38,689
Okay, maybe it's just because it's dressed like a fucking wizard that I don't remember it

4403
07:01:39,090 --> 07:01:45,180
That's what it looks like in the game in the regular game. Is it? Yeah, I don't believe you

4404
07:01:45,819 --> 07:01:48,540
That is what it looks like in the game. That is the character

4405
07:01:49,099 --> 07:01:50,400
I don't believe

4406
07:01:50,400 --> 07:01:57,939
That's fine. You'll see it. Um, we'll see it whenever you play through this game for some reason like right like right now

4407
07:01:58,020 --> 07:02:00,020
Well, it is a wizard. This is a wizard

4408
07:02:02,319 --> 07:02:12,979
If you ask nicely, okay, please go to the road of the manor and upgrade my weapon. Yes, no vote in progress

4409
07:02:14,299 --> 07:02:16,049
It just failed

4410
07:02:16,049 --> 07:02:26,619
It was an epic fail

4411
07:02:26,619 --> 07:02:30,860
I'm gonna throw you a curveball here. I catch it. You're out

4412
07:02:31,259 --> 07:02:37,139
I'm uh, i'm getting kind of hungry and I think I think i'm getting close to being wanting to probably end stream

4413
07:02:38,619 --> 07:02:40,939
um, i'm content with your

4414
07:02:42,130 --> 07:02:45,939
Words that you're saying i'm content

4415
07:02:46,659 --> 07:02:54,959
How do you how do you feel about um, oh no, I need sevens not sixes. God damn it

4416
07:02:55,040 --> 07:03:00,060
Let's do so let's do our upgrades. Hey guys, I think so seven I might let's go find out

4417
07:03:00,459 --> 07:03:03,709
Wait, did we go to them? No, he's behind us

4418
07:03:04,830 --> 07:03:09,090
I've played this game before too. I promise. Uh, what do you need?

4419
07:03:10,209 --> 07:03:14,130
Smithing stone seven and normal. I think i've asked you this like six times. Yeah

4420
07:03:15,200 --> 07:03:16,799
No, I don't you all right

4421
07:03:16,799 --> 07:03:19,040
So yeah, but you keep asking me this question

4422
07:03:19,439 --> 07:03:22,319
But I can't be like stupid and follow you and hit the same wall that you did

4423
07:03:25,250 --> 07:03:37,169
No, you can be stupid. All right, i'm about to be really powerful. Let's see. Oh man. I need I need some souls

4424
07:03:37,490 --> 07:03:40,450
This this really is like a randomizer experience

4425
07:03:40,610 --> 07:03:46,240
I have a smithing stone two three four five six seven eight and an ancient smithing stone

4426
07:03:46,319 --> 07:03:50,880
I just I I just don't have seven. I know I said that I had seven but you're not listening to me

4427
07:03:50,880 --> 07:03:52,560
Anyway, no, no, I I hear you

4428
07:03:52,560 --> 07:03:58,319
I it is a it is a randomizer experience and it is very strange and need to pay attention to lots of weird things going on

4429
07:03:58,819 --> 07:04:03,299
Okay, so we're done. Well, not yet. I want to upgrade this

4430
07:04:05,229 --> 07:04:08,939
Okay, so i'm done. I think we can separate

4431
07:04:09,680 --> 07:04:13,540
Worlds because I think we're separating we can separate worlds

4432
07:04:17,680 --> 07:04:22,560
We didn't even do our we didn't we didn't even do our stand next to each other unequip our swords and do a wave

4433
07:04:23,599 --> 07:04:31,409
Idiot, you're the idiot. You're the one that said that we're done idiot. All right

4434
07:04:31,569 --> 07:04:34,930
Is there's been a lot of fun? Yeah, the last couple days have been

4435
07:04:35,569 --> 07:04:46,979
Really really fun. Uh, look forward to more so we'll see you as next next weekend saturday sunday elden ring

4436
07:04:47,520 --> 07:04:53,819
Randomizers till we beat the game. I think we'll do it in the next two. I I think we'll do it this coming weekend

4437
07:04:53,819 --> 07:04:55,099
I think we're gonna beat it this coming weekend

4438
07:04:55,099 --> 07:04:59,819
I do I think if we actually just fought final bosses we could do it in like a day

4439
07:05:00,659 --> 07:05:04,020
I don't think we need to rush that that I I don't want to rush i'm saying like

4440
07:05:04,509 --> 07:05:07,310
It just depends how much side content we do because there's a million of it

4441
07:05:07,389 --> 07:05:14,500
Yeah, I think for the next stream I might also actually do the faith respect. We'll see. Yeah, we will see

4442
07:05:14,979 --> 07:05:19,740
But wait, we'll see i'm gonna have to sleep on it. I'm gonna have to really deeply consider take it easy stir

4443
07:05:19,979 --> 07:05:26,080
Good to see you again. Uh, it's been a lot of fun. Seriously. Talk to you soon, man. Yep. See you. Yep

4444
07:05:26,240 --> 07:05:30,340
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Why am I getting in?

4445
07:05:34,020 --> 07:05:36,020
Wait, I didn't do this in my world

4446
07:05:36,099 --> 07:06:00,020
All right, okay, let me sell some stuff and we will go from there

4447
07:06:08,529 --> 07:06:13,810
Uh sell all right, I don't who cares about these rune arcs. We're not gonna get the ruins anyways, so who cares?

4448
07:06:20,419 --> 07:06:26,110
Oh, never gonna use these

4449
07:06:29,790 --> 07:06:38,430
I'm never gonna use this that thing is cool. What the hell am I never gonna use?

4450
07:06:39,810 --> 07:06:45,970
Never gonna use this. I'm just not going to just be honest. I'm probably never gonna use any of this stuff

4451
07:06:45,970 --> 07:07:00,750
I could sell everything here. Okay, here we go plus seven. This thing is very dangerous now. Awesome

4452
07:07:01,979 --> 07:07:09,340
B it goes to b it scales b and b faith and strength. I didn't know that so I should now because I have 40

4453
07:07:10,740 --> 07:07:12,580
I should be

4454
07:07:12,580 --> 07:07:14,580
I should be putting all my points into faith now

4455
07:07:15,060 --> 07:07:24,610
Because it'll scale double right? So that's gonna be cool. I didn't know that it did that. That's huge scaling on both

4456
07:07:30,369 --> 07:07:36,560
Yeah, but that's gonna be it. It's been a lot of fun. This is elden ring is i'm just glad to be playing it again

4457
07:07:36,720 --> 07:07:38,270
To be honest

4458
07:07:38,270 --> 07:07:42,860
Um, that's all there is to it, right?

4459
07:07:42,860 --> 07:07:47,419
I will see you guys the next time I see you i've got some stuff I need to do in the next few days

4460
07:07:47,740 --> 07:07:52,080
We'll probably do the same thing. We did this week, which is probably like a thursday

4461
07:07:53,790 --> 07:08:04,139
Thursday saturday sunday scenario. I think that worked out pretty well. That's what we'll do, but that's it. See you guys later

4462
07:08:05,360 --> 07:08:18,139
Take care of yourselves. Let me just exit here. Yeah, we'll do thursday saturday sunday

07:08:21,470 --> 07:08:28,139
That's a good question. We will figure that out over the next few days. Hope you had fun
