1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,339
Hello. I told you it was gonna be no later than five. I said no later than 5

2
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:28,070
p.m. and it is 4 59. I tell you there's no way it's gonna be later than that. Were

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:35,579
you in chat? Um, for a- for maybe five minutes? Over the last hour and ten

4
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,200
minutes? I think the chat was open but that's just to make sure I have it

5
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:52,439
prepared for when I truly am live. Yeah. The only excuse for this is if you are

6
00:00:52,439 --> 00:01:01,140
currently on a face cam and you're in a full fat suit. Yeah, sorry guys. I had to

7
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:13,079
get- I had to get in a big fat suit. No, that is unfortunately not the case. This

8
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:23,180
is gonna be an instant classic stream. We'll see. I'm just gonna watch ads. I have

9
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:30,260
some compilations of 80s and 90s commercials. These streams are comfy. I

10
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,260
like these too. It's fun just to kind of watch and hang up. I'm enjoying it

11
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:44,689
already. I'm gonna do- yeah, I'll do face cam for a little bit. I'll do face cam

12
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:52,900
for a little bit. Are these American or international? These are American, I

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:05,349
believe. At least most of them are. Oh yeah. I don't plan on streaming for that

14
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:12,560
long today. I'm not gonna give a time limit but it's probably gonna be a few

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,919
hours. Something like that. I feel like there's only so many of these I can do before I just

16
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:35,460
need to like take a bath and then I'll be live tomorrow. Why are you taking a

17
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:46,780
bath? Bath? Well guys, I don't know. It's nice to take a bath sometime. What are we

18
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,219
doing tomorrow? We are playing House Flipper Farm Flipper Update or whatever

19
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,310
the hell it is. I'm very excited for it as you know. Maybe you don't. You might be

20
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,199
new to the stream. House Flipper is one of my favorite games ever and I'm

21
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,120
probably- I'm probably the only person on Twitch that has streamed it for a hundred

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:17,849
hours. I can claim that fame, I think. If somebody has streamed it longer than

23
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:42,020
me then yep. I'm good. You can take that award. Have you been doing- am I gonna

24
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:53,289
read that? Alright, are you guys ready? We're gonna watch some ads. I got

25
00:03:53,289 --> 00:04:01,139
compilations. I'm ready. Are you ready? Are you excited?

26
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:11,110
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's only like 2,000 people here

27
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:29,040
that heard that so I don't care. Yahoo. Yeah. It's 10k? What? It was- my thing

28
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,720
says 2. There's way more people just heard that. Whatever. I feel like if you've

29
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,120
decided to watch this stream you've already decided what could happen here.

30
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,410
Does that make sense? I feel like if you've been here, you

31
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:56,360
did you have watched more than one stream, I think you know that this stream sucks.

32
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:05,180
Let's go. Alright, I'm ready. No, this stream is sick actually. This is a

33
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,180
good stream. I like this stream. It's my stream so I want to say that. Come on.

34
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:30,259
This is mid shit. I like this mid shit. Alright, now let's watch commercials

35
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:48,589
together. Alright, this is this is 80s. Are we ready? I'm sure it's not too loud.

36
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:57,949
Yeah, back off. Hair dye. No hair dye actually. I'm just- I'm just gonna go

37
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:07,180
until it looks bad. You know what I mean? If I started using hair dye now, why'd you go

38
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:18,970
with 986 and not 985? I don't know. No, I'm just gonna age. However I look is

39
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:28,879
how I look. I'm just gonna age. Alright, let's go. I don't know why I sat there

40
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,850
for so long. Alright, are you ready? These are 80s commercials. I can't wait to

41
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,540
start to talk about them. Oh, it's not too loud.

42
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,540
Return after these messages. I think it's alright. Alright.

43
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,889
Okay everybody, come outside. Everybody ready for a-

44
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,889
I had one of these.

45
00:06:50,889 --> 00:07:10,959
These were fun. I'm pausing. I know. Don't stop pausing. Don't skip. I just have to

46
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,550
say something about this. These things are really fun until you hit a bunch of

47
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,959
rocks. There was always that one- that one kid that was- the thing was laid out

48
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,699
and you start all the way at the back of the yard and you run as fast as you

49
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,199
possibly- this thing was not- this thing was not designed for you to go that fast

50
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,279
on it. You could just go off of it or there'd be a bump in the grass and it

51
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,639
would be a fucking rock and you would just start sprinting. Sprint sprint

52
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,019
sprint jump like layout and just fucking slide like a cartoon bowling alley. Like

53
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,860
you're sliding all the way down and then you sort of rock on your elbow. These

54
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,279
things were crazy. This thing was a hazard. It really was. But yeah, it was a

55
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:08,879
hazard. It was still fun though. Didn't they make changes to this over the years

56
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,060
where you kind of couldn't go that fast? I feel like that was- I feel like that's

57
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:28,040
accurate. Oh, I didn't tweet. Okay, let me tweet. And there was always that kid at

58
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:36,470
the party or whatever that they did this until they went home. It was, okay, let's

59
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,000
get the slip and slide out and like little Jerry just does not stop for eight

60
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,440
hours. It's the only thing they do. They were fun though. All right, let me tweet.

61
00:08:50,440 --> 00:09:06,320
Hey, there's a tweet. Good, okay. All right, officially tweeted. They are going

62
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:24,590
fast though. I want to see how fast they're actually going. Yeah, you sprint.

63
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:30,590
Slip and slide comes with plastic slide and fasteners from Whammo. And fasteners.

64
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,909
Did anybody even use those?

65
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:07,340
Thank you. Where's Grimace's voice lines? Is that before that Grimace had voice lines?

66
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:35,370
What the fuck? How does this not hurt? This would be excruciating pain. What? I want to

67
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:47,850
see more of what happened there. That dude had a straight face. What was that an ad

68
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:59,720
for? What was that an ad for? They did- oh, for Turboteen. Okay. What was it trying to

69
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:17,210
show us? Excuse me. The no reaction is just- I don't know. I like it. I don't- this is

70
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:26,399
like- there needs to be a little bit of, I think, emotion here. We'll return after these

71
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:38,059
messages. That's the same guy. That's the same kid right there. This is one of the Turboteens.

72
00:11:38,059 --> 00:12:10,240
He's in the same outfit. That's super accurate though. Kids just like- when kids really just

73
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,919
love just random made up words, it's just so fun to them. That's a very accurate commercial.

74
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:30,909
You try it. What was it? Let me see if I can go- Well, let me give me a second to do it.

75
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:42,639
The floppy- the floppy flat fruit snacks from S- Sunkist. I didn't- I couldn't do it. The floppy-

76
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,480
the floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist. The floppy flat fruit snacks from Sunkist. Fucking

77
00:12:48,480 --> 00:13:31,259
easy. Yes! What simpler times? Wow. Times are so different. This was enough

78
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:44,669
to drive everybody crazy. I got a standing ovation back in the 80s. Times are so simple back then.

79
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,350
Oh, carrot. Otto's gonna eat one of those later. What are you fucking down that?

80
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200
What is this food?

81
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,009
Oh, Jack. Turboteen's back.

82
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:48,730
I just want you to know so bad that this kid could turn into a car.

83
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,009
Is that the whole show? Is the entire show Turboteen that?

84
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:39,159
Dairy Queen Sunday free. Oh, free Sunday. We're gonna replay this because I don't give a shit

85
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:46,399
that McDonald's like serves coffee. You know what I mean? I'm gonna restart this. I don't give a

86
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:54,909
shit that McDonald's has coffee. It's like a cafe now. She's like, oh, McDonald's. It's like a cafe.

87
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,539
We have coffee and lunch. Where are these fucked up characters?

88
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,320
Where are all the McNuggets? Like the puppet show?

89
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,559
Packages of Froot Loops. Ronald McDonald presents us Chicken McNuggets. It makes the big story.

90
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,559
One day Goldilocks and the Gingerbread Man were bringing delicious sauces to Grandma.

91
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,080
Wait a minute. That's not in the script. You're in the wrong story. I am. Aren't you little bo-peep?

92
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,600
Hold it. We're doing Little Red Robin Hood and it's two pigs. Pigs?

93
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,440
It's a good time for the great taste. You're all in the wrong story.

94
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,419
But the right sauce is Ronald McDonald's. That was so funny.

95
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:49,179
A lineup of fun starting out. Oh, it's the credits of Turbo Teen. What's happening?

96
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,500
Then just around the bend, it's that unpredictable Gary Coleman and different strokes.

97
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,379
And for high flying action, it's the Dukes of Hazzard at four. It's all happening. You hate

98
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:06,410
Ronald? Why? Right here on BRC 6. How could you hate Ronald McDonald? Like I have all the things to hate.

99
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:19,740
Oh, I'm all right with this.

100
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,930
Schoolhouse Rock.

101
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:59,480
The curtain is rising. We're so glad to have you here. Come see a new show daily in the atmosphere.

102
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:11,000
Act one. That's fun. The sun shines down on field and town. On forest, mountain, desert, sea and snow.

103
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,200
Some heat's absorbed. Some bounces off. So here it's hot. This is an ad. Maybe not.

104
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,640
I think it's just here.

105
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:30,269
Sing with, I don't know the lyrics.

106
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:38,269
There's science here.

107
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,250
Look, I don't give a shit if you have coffee.

108
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,319
I want this. Get this back.

109
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,359
How do you read this trap? Laughing my ass off. I'm playing Metal Gear Solid 5,

110
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,720
so I won't listen for your answer. Whoa, why am I reading your comment?

111
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:22,960
What? What does that mean? You asked a question and you just dipped right after asking the question.

112
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,619
This actually, did I go to, no, it's the same one. It's some educational shit, right?

113
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:52,720
Cloud Japan. Remember, you're not learning. How do you know that?

114
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,440
Skip it if it's not an ad, but I kind of like it.

115
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,119
I mean, Herboteen technically wasn't an ad. I'm glad I didn't skip that.

116
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:26,140
ABC's Schoolhouse Rock is brought to you by.

117
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,299
Okay, now we're on Schoolhouse Rock. Okay.

118
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,859
Wake up, guys. We've got work to do.

119
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,059
We've got to get out the breakfast edition. What's it say? Snap, crackle, pop.

120
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,460
What else? Hey, like wake the fuck up. Like, holy smokes.

121
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,420
What are you, a newspaper?

122
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,099
Sounds good. Kellogg's Rice Krispies, the talking part of this complete breakfast.

123
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,819
Hold on a second. Good work, guys.

124
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:02,720
I love this because this is actually really hard. This is really difficult.

125
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,359
This kid doesn't, can't see these characters. They probably,

126
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:12,029
they probably told him to look in a certain direction and this is really hard to do.

127
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:18,119
So, Kellogg's Rice Krispies. I want to see the beginning again.

128
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,559
I want to see, oh, they're sleeping.

129
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:27,200
ABC's Schoolhouse Rock is brought to you by Kellogg.

130
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,700
They are, they're in REM sleep right now and this kid drops the equivalent of like

131
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:39,720
three bowling balls on the table right next to his head. Right next to his head.

132
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,339
Look at that reaction. Look at this. They're not happy. This is awful. This is, this is awful.

133
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:54,460
Look at the fear in these faces. This is tons of, this is uncomfortable. This is awful.

134
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,720
They still don't know. Look at how tired they are. And then, to do what?

135
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:09,289
What was this kid waking them up for? He's still not out of it yet.

136
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,289
Keep in mind, they just were ripped out of REM sleep and told they needed to do this today.

137
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,470
Was there a job to pour the cereal?

138
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,269
Oh, Schoolhouse Rock. Let's go.

139
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,420
I don't know why I thought that was so funny. Just, just listen. Hold on.

140
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:18,170
I don't know why that's funny to me. Is that funny?

141
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:23,769
I think it's because I could hear like the, this is ABC.

142
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:32,029
You're the power line. Your daddy and you make the house look fine.

143
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:36,480
Wait, why are they doing this?

144
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:48,480
This lightning bug doesn't raise his ass in the near power. Stay away from power. Stay away from power.

145
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,609
Yeah. Okay. That's good. We'll return after these messages.

146
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:04,299
You're in the big league play. You make a perfect sly. You're in the big league.

147
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:08,059
Big league house. When you keep the team alive. You're in the big league.

148
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,779
Big league shreds. When you block a shot or two.

149
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,940
You're in the big league flavor. You're in the big league chew.

150
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,019
Big league chew. Man-sized wads of great taste of shredded bubblegum stuffed into a giant stay-fresh

151
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,660
couch. You're in the big league flavor and big league bubble. You're in the big league chew.

152
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,180
Did it say man-sized? No, it didn't.

153
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,480
You're in the big league flavor. You're in the big league chew.

154
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,559
Big league chew. Man-sized wads of great taste of shredded bubblegum stuffed into a giant stay-fresh

155
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,680
couch. You're in the big league flavor and big league bubble. You're in the big league chew.

156
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,759
That stuff is delicious, by the way. I love that stuff.

157
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,160
That there's OJ Joe. I haven't had it in a long time and it's good.

158
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,759
Where they'll take the sweet juice and put it into new OJs. A crunchy delicious orange

159
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:19,529
juice. Wait, this is a... It's a cereal.

160
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:29,210
That's weird. I never heard of that. Orange juice cereal?

161
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,700
You get detention for shit like that. You get detention for shit like that.

162
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,880
Sometimes a man just needs to be alone with his fruit chewy Newton's cookies.

163
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,529
Those are still good. With fruit chewy chunks of real apple.

164
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:17,930
Hey Jimbo, where are you? And Finn Newtons too.

165
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,950
You're here somewhere and I got those fruit chewy Newtons.

166
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,309
Fruit chewy Newtons. Let you ride my bike.

167
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,710
Tastes too good to give up. Nabisco.

168
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:34,670
I mean, they're good. Next, who's the hippest? Who's the happy?

169
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:45,849
What big surprises come in tiny packages? If it's fun we want, then it's the little...

170
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:49,529
Can we watch? Can I see? I want to see something one more time.

171
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:52,250
I'm Captain OJ Reborn. My motto's tried and true.

172
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,170
Read a book today, I bet you'll say OJ. I'll read more too.

173
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:57,849
Okay.

174
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,210
We now continue with Rubik the OJ.

175
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,849
I want to... I just want to see one more time.

176
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:17,529
I just need to see this. Just one final time was Rubik the Amazing Cube.

177
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:21,789
Okay, there's so much weird shit from the 80s and 90s.

178
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:25,069
I just... It's just, this is so fucking messed up.

179
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:27,230
I have to just... I just need to see this one more time.

180
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:52,200
What is giving him this power? Watch something else?

181
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:57,200
I am. I don't want to give you any spoilers.

182
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,660
I... Let's come back.

183
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
You're in the big leagues.

184
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:30,109
All right, this is 90s. I had a lot of bookmarks.

185
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:38,279
I want to make sure I didn't... New novels set in the 80s.

186
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,880
How's the camping? Is it... Oh, is this... Oh, okay.

187
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,950
We should read this.

188
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:55,369
Mr. McDonald, let's talk chicken.

189
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:56,970
What?

190
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,170
Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets

191
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,809
to your chicken muck nuggets by almost three to one?

192
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:04,730
No, sir.

193
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:10,009
And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the colonel's secret blend of 11 herbs and spices?

194
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:10,809
No, sir.

195
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,970
So how do you expect to sell chicken?

196
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:15,369
Toys. Lots of toys.

197
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,690
Taste our best.

198
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,009
A dollar and 99 for the colonel's chicken sandwich and fries or Kentucky nuggets and fries.

199
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:22,890
What am I supposed to be doing without makeup on?

200
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,849
There comes a time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change.

201
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:27,450
You know what I'm talking about, fellas?

202
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,809
Suddenly, wheels means cars instead of skateboards.

203
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,210
Look, let's broaden your horizons. It's time to move on.

204
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,849
Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips,

205
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,970
why not tear into a bag of nacho cheese, Doritos tortilla chips?

206
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,569
Bigger taste, bigger crunch.

207
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,140
What is this fucking AI-generated couch that he's sitting on?

208
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,900
Nacho chip that bites back.

209
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,299
Come on.

210
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,940
Nacho cheese Doritos.

211
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,779
You're a man now. You're gonna handle it.

212
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,539
Oh, man-sized portions, of course.

213
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,259
Punch all you want.

214
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,619
We'll make more.

215
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,180
Dave. Dave.

216
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,059
I think these are a lot of fast food.

217
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,660
If you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.

218
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,140
They will?

219
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,380
If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.

220
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,420
It has to be boneless.

221
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,779
If you make it with lettuce and tomato.

222
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:13,900
And honey and mustard.

223
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,180
And put it all together on a toasted bun, they will come.

224
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,539
Call it Wendy's grilled chicken sandwich.

225
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,789
Dave, I told you they will come.

226
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,430
It's Wendy. I just can't figure out how she's doing it.

227
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:32,190
For fun around here, me and the boys like to do something a little bit crazy.

228
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,190
Put two kinds of cheese on a cheeseburger.

229
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:35,869
Oh, that's crazy.

230
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:39,630
For a new taste, head to the store for two kinds of cheese and lean ground beef.

231
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,069
Cheddar and mustard.

232
00:30:41,069 --> 00:30:41,869
Crazy.

233
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:44,900
Uh-oh.

234
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,440
Fortunately, Seeley's exclusive post-traumatic sleep system is designed to support everyone differently.

235
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,579
Keep your night from becoming your worst nightmare.

236
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,259
Is that a sink in their bedroom?

237
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:12,460
For a better night's sleep, better sleep on a ceiling.

238
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,579
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

239
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:14,059
Wednesday.

240
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:15,420
Marty, this isn't just a-

241
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:19,549
Where is this?

242
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,109
More comfortably.

243
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,720
Is this supposed to be the bathroom?

244
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,079
Keep your night from becoming your worst nightmare.

245
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,039
Oh, I thought it was sitting, like, where a nightstand would be.

246
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,319
For a better night's sleep, better sleep on a ceiling.

247
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:32,839
Wednesday.

248
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:35,160
Marty, this isn't just about sex.

249
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,880
No, no, I know.

250
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,779
There's a little about sex, though, isn't it?

251
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,579
It's sort of nice on the phone.

252
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:43,900
It's a portable. I'll bring it with me.

253
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,259
Things are really heating up.

254
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:47,019
Anything but love after Doogie Hussein.

255
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:50,220
When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast,

256
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,700
I didn't think I needed to say where.

257
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
It could only be one place.

258
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,980
Where else can you get this delicious bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit?

259
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,700
Uh, nowhere.

260
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,299
So much for him.

261
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,980
True.

262
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,650
Jump that with your car?

263
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:25,079
Nice move, Jack.

264
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,279
The Prelude SI with four-wheel steering.

265
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:32,200
I mean, I would consider that cheating.

266
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,839
That's cheating.

267
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,119
They didn't do it.

268
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,759
You think you could have a party every time you come out with a new product?

269
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,799
This is really nice.

270
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,720
They don't have a party like this every night.

271
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,599
This is big.

272
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,559
This is really big.

273
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,319
This new light microwave popcorn.

274
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,359
I thought that was a cigar.

275
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,400
With one-third fewer calories and two-thirds less fat than our regular microwave.

276
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,920
And it pops up more than any other light microwave.

277
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,640
It's gonna keep my figure just like it is today.

278
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,079
Well, you're pretty good-looking, Grandpa, you know.

279
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,680
That's what Grandma says, too.

280
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,180
Yeah.

281
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:59,400
Not all of us can be as good-looking as you, Grandpa.

282
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,900
That's great.

283
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,160
That's true. That's true.

284
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,799
If you don't have the Orville Rennbacher in your pantry,

285
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,599
I don't know what the hell's going on.

286
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,200
Look what's new at McDonald's.

287
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,240
What is it, Dad?

288
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,240
Let's just wait and see.

289
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,160
It's the stars of Walt Disney's classic movie 101 Dalmatians.

290
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
Oh, they're just trying to sell toys.

291
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
They got the real chicken over here at KFC.

292
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,920
The Colonel with Sergeant Tibbs.

293
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,039
Lucky, get down.

294
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,069
Or Cruella Toy.

295
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,430
Each week when you buy your kids a $1.99 hamburger Happy Meal.

296
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,549
It was a $1.90.

297
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,670
It was only $2.

298
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,950
How much is Happy Meal now?

299
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:37,150
Does your man control you, McSalad?

300
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,960
That was just staring into the camera.

301
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,880
Now at Little Caesars, you can get Picnic Picnic.

302
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,240
Two medium pizzas, two orders of crazy bread,

303
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,920
and two servings of cold classic all for only $7.98.

304
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,960
It's Picnic Picnic.

305
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:03,400
Two pizzas, two crazy breads, two soft drinks,

306
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,960
all that food for only $7.98.

307
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,460
What?

308
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,880
When it rains, it pours.

309
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,239
Picnic Picnic only at Little Caesars.

310
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,199
This was $8.

311
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:13,579
What?

312
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,440
Are you serious?

313
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,719
Why are beers that go down lightly?

314
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,760
Watered down so heavily?

315
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,059
Why?

316
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,099
Ask?

317
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,059
Why?

318
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,760
Turn off the water.

319
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:29,130
And turn Bud Dry.

320
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,510
It's smooth draft-tasted dry brew.

321
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,010
Bud Dry?

322
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,030
Not watered down.

323
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,630
To drink light.

324
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:39,309
What are they implying about their other beer?

325
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:42,650
So why get soaked when you can drink Bud Dry?

326
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,769
A baby changes everything.

327
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:48,570
Safety takes on a whole new meaning when it's somebody you love in that car.

328
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:51,309
This is our family.

329
00:34:51,309 --> 00:34:54,030
They're the most technically advanced and life-like dummies in the world.

330
00:34:56,809 --> 00:35:00,250
Only GM uses a family like this to develop safety technology

331
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,449
because we know quality cars, safe cars, should help protect everyone.

332
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,130
I look at my family and I want us to be thinking of everything.

333
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,730
GM safety, it's not one thing, it's everything.

334
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,650
She's everything to me.

335
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,019
Dorothy.

336
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,619
Can you marry me?

337
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,300
Where's my ring?

338
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,280
A life.

339
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,519
I thought they had to show the car speeding.

340
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:34,289
Like going fast into what I imagine is a wall.

341
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,880
Like that was just like kind of came out of nowhere for me.

342
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:43,199
Ugh.

343
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:51,599
Fuck.

344
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,800
Ugh.

345
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,570
It's important.

346
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,690
This is important shit.

347
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,250
GM safety, it's not one thing.

348
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,889
I want us to be thinking of everything.

349
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,769
GM safety, it's not one thing.

350
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:09,489
It's everything.

351
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:11,409
She's everything to me.

352
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,730
I, it just, it just kind of fucked up.

353
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,409
Dorothy, can you marry me?

354
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,570
Where's my ring?

355
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,530
That's important stuff.

356
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:18,929
A lifesaver?

357
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,650
I did not like to see the car flying by and I'm like, what the fuck, man?

358
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,690
Don't worry.

359
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,449
We'll live with my mother.

360
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,050
Lifesaver's candy.

361
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,329
Isn't life delicious?

362
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,590
Macy's preseason sale.

363
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,150
The shopping opportunity of the year.

364
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:36,670
You'll save on fall's newest fashions now.

365
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,190
Before the fall season, at our lowest prices of the year.

366
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,949
The best for women, men, and kids.

367
00:36:43,949 --> 00:36:45,710
Why are they taking pictures?

368
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,590
Everything you need for fall, from the names you really want.

369
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,949
These aren't even the models.

370
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,630
These people just walked up on stage.

371
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,670
Macy's preseason sale.

372
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,639
Don't let prices go up.

373
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,570
This fifth.

374
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,239
This is just, the show's not on yet.

375
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,559
A bunch of people just started walking up on stage.

376
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,400
Our famous steak or chicken fajita combos and a delicious dessert.

377
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,960
All just $7.95 at El Torito.

378
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,699
Three bites, hey!

379
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,699
Three bites big, house of eight.

380
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,579
New snacks, snacks, and Milky Way.

381
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,179
Three bites big, house of eight.

382
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,539
Hold on, I missed that.

383
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,059
This one's fucking crazy, hold on.

384
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,980
Three bites big, house of eight.

385
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:32,539
New snacks, snacks, and Milky Way.

386
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:34,300
Introducing Milky Way and Snickers.

387
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,940
They're a brand new size.

388
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,739
Are they huge?

389
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,019
A new snack size.

390
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:38,619
Snack around the house side.

391
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:39,420
No, they're small.

392
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,980
But wait, wait, wait.

393
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,420
Why are they so big in the bag?

394
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,619
Three bites big, house of eight.

395
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:45,179
New snacks, snacks, and Milky Way.

396
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,260
Three bites big, house of eight.

397
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,380
New snacks, snacks, and Milky Way.

398
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,460
And now, today's weather.

399
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,539
Cold winds out of the north-northwest.

400
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:55,940
With a 30% chance of snow tonight.

401
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,019
Temperatures dropping to the mid-to-low 20s.

402
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,460
Boy, this is going to be a hot day.

403
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,420
Keep it out there today.

404
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,460
At last, a weatherproof formula that

405
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,820
holds longer and stronger than the other leading pumps.

406
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,539
Honey, don't forget your boots.

407
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:15,900
Exclusively ours, new final and ultimate hold.

408
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,460
The weatherproof hold that lets you laugh at the weather.

409
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,019
Sandy Davis Jr.'s 60th anniversary celebration

410
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:24,219
will continue in a moment.

411
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,179
Tuesday's terrific in Port Lauderdale.

412
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,420
Hey, first, did I just feel a drop?

413
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,539
Or are you drooling?

414
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:32,219
It's who's the boss then?

415
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:33,420
She dumped me.

416
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,539
Paul, snap out of it.

417
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,300
She said I was suffocating her.

418
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,980
I thought she wanted to be suffocated.

419
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,420
The Wonder Years, Tuesday.

420
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:46,750
This is what American Airlines does better than anyone else.

421
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,699
Arrive on time, again and again.

422
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,739
In fact, American has had the best on-time arrival record

423
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:59,059
of the nine largest domestic airlines

424
00:38:59,059 --> 00:39:01,219
for as long as records have been kept.

425
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,960
American Airlines, the on-time machine.

426
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,559
Is that still true?

427
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,730
It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.

428
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:14,369
It's big.

429
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,769
I got to make sure I carry my jacket around in two fingers.

430
00:39:19,409 --> 00:39:19,650
Hold on.

431
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,369
Let me pinch my jacket between my thumb and my index finger.

432
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,369
It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.

433
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,409
It's big.

434
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:26,610
You're just one I've ever seen.

435
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,050
Of course, being a custom job, some assembly was required.

436
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,409
It'll be a few weeks, people.

437
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,050
But finally, it was ready.

438
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:38,369
One of the world's fastest check writing systems.

439
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,329
Some insurance companies look for ways

440
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:43,010
to get your money from you faster.

441
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,329
Here should be $12,000 an hour.

442
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,849
At Aetna, we look for ways to get your money to you faster.

443
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,829
Probe of misconduct by Oakland Housing Police on 7 at 11.

444
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,829
See, a woman's body is merely a frame

445
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:04,019
I created to release.

446
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:13,099
You won't see a leg in Paris this year.

447
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,090
No matter what the gentleman prefers.

448
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,730
The lady prefers hands.

449
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:34,739
Wake up to the nutritious delicious taste of carnation instant breakfast.

450
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:40,900
I would have loved to have been in some of these commercials.

451
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,139
Hey, can I just say, if all I had to do like,

452
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:47,300
okay, sir, you are the actor for this commercial.

453
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,380
You're going to take a sip out of chocolate milk

454
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,619
and you're going to do like a goofy movement with your arms

455
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,699
and do like a weird walk and that's it.

456
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:54,980
That's that's what you do.

457
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,260
I would be so good at this.

458
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,949
Take a sip of chocolate milk and then do like a little like,

459
00:40:59,949 --> 00:41:02,349
whoa, I can feel that all the way through my bones

460
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:03,469
and then just walk out the door.

461
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,070
I'd be pretty good at that.

462
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:09,739
I think dog dog lovers.

463
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,380
This is ordinary dog food.

464
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,699
But feast your eyes on grand gourmet.

465
00:41:14,699 --> 00:41:18,539
Twenty five percent more protein and less fat than leading brands.

466
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:21,739
Why do I feel like now it looks better?

467
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:23,659
Why do I feel like they're advertising to people?

468
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,659
It's like, oh, yeah.

469
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:26,940
Hey, dog lovers.

470
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,500
They didn't say anything about, hey, your dog is going to love this.

471
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,059
It was, hey, dog lovers, don't eat this shit.

472
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:34,059
Eat the chunky one that we just came up with.

473
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:39,679
But feast your hey, dog lovers.

474
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,239
This is ordinary dog food.

475
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,639
But feast your eyes on grand gourmet.

476
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,559
Twenty five percent more protein and less fat than leading brands.

477
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,079
Oh, grand gourmet.

478
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,519
And now it looks better.

479
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,199
It is better for dog lovers.

480
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,079
Red Lobster introduces our shrimp sensations dinner.

481
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,960
Just seven ninety nine with tangy shrimp vera grooves and new parmesan fried shrimp.

482
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,550
We can see your mouth of watering.

483
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:11,070
I'm just sitting there like, hold on.

484
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,949
That's so stupid.

485
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,960
I mean, it looks it does look pretty fucking delicious, doesn't it, though?

486
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,239
Very dog food.

487
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,300
But feast your I guess if I can get through this.

488
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,739
Hey, dog lovers.

489
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,300
This is ordinary dog food.

490
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,780
But feast your eyes on grand gourmet.

491
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,380
Twenty five percent more protein.

492
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,539
I can't.

493
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:36,420
It looks kind of good.

494
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,780
Less fat than leading brands.

495
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,820
OK, I'm telling you right now, I've eaten Salisbury steak that looked worse than that.

496
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,659
Grand gourmet.

497
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:47,099
And now it looks better.

498
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:47,820
It is better.

499
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,659
Red Lobster introduces our shrimp sensations dinner.

500
00:42:51,659 --> 00:42:56,699
Just seven ninety nine with tangy shrimp vera grooves and new parmesan fried shrimp.

501

Together with popcorn shrimp.

502
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,179
Specially priced.

503
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,300
Just seven ninety nine.

504
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,860
Why is everything in nineteen ninety eight dollars?

505
00:43:03,659 --> 00:43:06,219
It's Red Lobster's new lunch special.

506
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:07,099
Shrimp and chicken.

507
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:08,699
Just three ninety nine.

508
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:13,579
Golden fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast with salad and baked potato.

509
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:14,619
Just three ninety nine.

510
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:14,940
Wait.

511
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,780
For a limited time at Red Lobster.

512
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,300
Wait a second.

513
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,920
Together with popcorn shrimp.

514
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,880
Specially priced.

515
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,079
Just seven ninety nine.

516
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,199
This is way more expensive than the other one.

517
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,320
For a limited time.

518
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,760
Now at Red Lobster.

519
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,719
This is a huge difference.

520
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:33,039
It's Red Lobster's new lunch special.

521
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:33,920
Shrimp and chicken.

522
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,519
Just three ninety nine.

523
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,320
Golden fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast with salad and baked potato.

524
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,760
Just three ninety nine.

525
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,760
For a limited time at Red Lobster.

526
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,239
For lunch.

527
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,519
Oh it's a lunch special.

528
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,519
To our tribal breakfast cereals.

529
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:48,000
Total.

530
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,800
Kellogg's just right.

531
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,320
Both high nutrition cereals.

532
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,840
So what might make one better than the other?

533
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,039
Just right has vitamin B1.

534
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:53,840
We have vitamin B1.

535
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,960
Just right has vitamin B2.

536
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,280
B2.

537
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,159
Just right has iron.

538
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:56,639
We have iron.

539
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,599
Just right has vitamin E.

540
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,239
Oh plenty B.

541
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,440
Just right has vitamin B6.

542
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,079
B6 here.

543
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,440
Just right has almonds.

544
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,840
Just right has sweet dates.

545
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,639
Plump raisins.

546
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,480
Plus four different tasty grains.

547
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,199
Just right has two out of three people preferring our taste.

548
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,780
Which means just right is just better.

549
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,420
Kellogg's just right.

550
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,539
Well what if you don't want all that shit?

551
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:14,900
It makes it just better.

552
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,920
Something that the 80s and 90s did that kind of went away.

553
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,880
I don't know if you guys have picked up on this too.

554
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,519
Companies used to eviscerate each other by name.

555
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,559
It wasn't just oh oh those other brands.

556
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,190
No no no it was like like hey total.

557
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,030
Your cereal sucks.

558
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:35,409
You suck.

559
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:37,699
They would do it by name.

560
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:39,070
Nintendo.

561
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:40,989
Sega.

562
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:43,630
They used to just make fun of each other and use logos too.

563
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,510
They literally have the total logo.

564
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,190
And they have some guy being an actor.

565
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,469
Four different tasty almonds.

566
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:54,030
Pretending that this cereal sucks compared to this one.

567
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:59,300
It's crazy that this is they used to do this all the time.

568
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:07,260
Yeah I don't think you could even put this box on camera for like a commercial.

569
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,380
I don't think so right?

570
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,820
They do it on Twitter now.

571
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,809
I feel like I haven't seen it in a long time.

572
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,539
Just right has sweet dates.

573
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:21,820
Plump raisins plus.

574
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,980
Right now this representative to total is coming to a realization.

575
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,019
Which means just right is.

576
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,699
Oh no no that's way better.

577
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:29,500
My cereal is stupid.

578
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,619
It's the taste that makes it.

579
00:45:30,619 --> 00:45:31,340
Your cereal is better.

580
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,139
I'm gonna eat yours now.

581
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:34,780
The Mureen earwax removal system has drops.

582
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,420
I don't want this one.

583
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:35,980
I don't want to wash this one.

584
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,539
It's probably gross.

585
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:39,579
That safely loosen hardened wax when used as directed.

586
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:42,780
Plus an ear washer to gently flush wax away.

587
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,179
Mureen, the complete medically approved system to safely remove earwax.

588
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,559
Is well below zero this morning.

589
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,360
That's Chevy's heartbeat.

590
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,070
With the electrical system fully taxed.

591
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,789
Chevy delivers for viable cold starting.

592
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:12,590
After thousands of tests an incredible 99.9% success record.

593
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:16,030
With 84 models redesigned and engineered.

594
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,349
GM is putting quality on the road.

595
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:23,389
All right I just gotta say um there's like a hundred million people in the United States.

596
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:27,630
That do what they did like a third of the whole year.

597
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,030
And there's not a whole team of people with walkie talkies.

598
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,119
It's Velveeta versus cheddar.

599
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:37,840
It's orange juice.

600
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,639
Our Velveeta.

601
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:39,280
That is thick.

602
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Oh that's not I thought it was orange juice.

603
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,480
When the cookbook.

604
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,360
Oh that would be fucking awful orange juice.

605
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,000
Naked with Velveeta it cooks better.

606
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,360
That actually didn't even look good.

607
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,719
That looked kind of every day.

608
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:51,599
Gross didn't it?

609
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,960
When the cook.

610
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,460
Oh it's because they're saying it's gross.

611
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,099
It's Velveeta versus cheddar.

612
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,420
Our Velveeta melts much better.

613
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,219
When the cookbook calls for cheddar.

614
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,820
Naked with Velveeta it cooks better.

615
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,139
I mean you saw what the you saw what was on camera.

616
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:17,139
Every day 22 million people come into McDonald's.

617
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:21,539
They count on the same hot fresh food at every McDonald's all over the world.

618
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,179
But imagine if there were only one McDonald's you could count on.

619
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:31,389
And 22 million people came in at the same time.

620
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,349
The whole restaurant would fill up.

621
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:39,869
The city would fill up.

622
00:47:39,869 --> 00:47:44,909
And all those people in one place would cause the earth to tilt off its axis

623
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:46,590
and go spinning into space.

624
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,190
Good thing we can avoid this catastrophic adventure.

625
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,829
By McDonald's having like 50,000 locations.

626
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:59,469
And that would make a real mess of everything.

627
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:06,210
That's why we make every McDonald's from Poughkeepsie to Pomona

628
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,449
just as good as every other McDonald's.

629
00:48:09,409 --> 00:48:10,929
McDonald's protects us.

630
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,920
While the Daytona Shelby Turbo may not be quite as plush as the Aston Martin

631
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,559
and the power plant isn't quite like a Lamborghini.

632
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,880
You're never gonna catch me saying a goddamn thing bad about McDonald's.

633
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,239
One of the most powerful front wheels.

634
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:26,400
I'm sorry I'm never gonna I love that one.

635
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,599
And while it doesn't quite reach the speed of a Testerosa

636
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,239
at that speed you might miss something.

637
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,960
The all-new Dodge Daytona Shelby Turbo.

638
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
The hot new spirit of Dodge.

639
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,239
Now get the $2,000 back at Dodge.

640
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:40,960
Guaranteed.

641
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,679
Bravest men.

642
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,360
And no dream.

643
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,159
Turbo teen.

644
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,199
Are those with something to prove?

645
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,880
They gotta know that nobody's gonna fight.

646
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,679
Red cars.

647
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:54,639
We're just super popular.

648
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,719
Come daddy go and let the 54 get into us.

649
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:58,480
Matthew Broderick.

650
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,599
We'll be ready sir.

651
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,880
Denzel Washington.

652
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,079
Come on!

653
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,199
Kerry Elwes.

654
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:03,699
Ready!

655
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,440
Morgan Freeman.

656
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,619
Now playing at a theater near you.

657
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,469
In Vermont Washington when a kid's 18 he's old enough to drive.

658
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:17,869
Old enough.

659
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:18,590
There it is.

660
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,309
And old enough to worry about something most adults have.

661
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:22,269
Gingivitis.

662
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:26,190
An early reversible gum disease that left untreated could get serious.

663
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,630
Just ask your dentist.

664
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,030
Fortunately many know enough to use Listerine.

665
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,789
The only non-prescription mouthwash accepted by the American Dental Association

666
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:36,429
for helping to prevent and reduce plaque and gingivitis.

667
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:37,789
Yep.

668
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,230
If you're old enough to worry about-

669
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:39,710
Hold on.

670
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,510
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

671
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,469
To reduce plaque and gingivitis.

672
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,750
They're not ready for this ball.

673
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,389
Yep.

674
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,190
If you're old-

675
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,539
Oh, was somebody there?

676
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:45,940
I couldn't tell.

677
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,699
Enough to worry about gum disease.

678
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:49,860
You ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.

679
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:52,900
I want to try something different.

680
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,500
Um, hold on.

681
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,619
I gotta process this one.

682
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,099
Oh, rewatch Andy.

683
00:49:59,099 --> 00:49:59,659
Rewatch Andy.

684
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:00,059
I don't.

685
00:50:00,059 --> 00:50:00,699
I need to see it.

686
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,380
Now playing at a theater near you.

687
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,099
Let me process-

688
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:03,500
They're saying-

689
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:03,980
What were they saying?

690
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:08,699
They're saying, when you turn 18, you worry about driving a car.

691
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:09,420
What was it?

692
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,940
In Vermont, Washington, when a kid's 18, he's old enough to drive.

693
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,820
Why only there?

694
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,679
Is it?

695
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,800
Old enough to vote.

696
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,880
And old enough to worry about something most adult.

697
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,679
Old enough to drive?

698
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:20,639
Old enough to vote.

699
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,110
And old enough to be terribly concerned about your gums.

700
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,190
Gingivitis.

701
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,030
An early reversible gum disease that left untreated could get serious.

702
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,070
Just ask your dentist.

703
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:33,059
Vote?

704
00:50:34,179 --> 00:50:34,420
What?

705
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,300
I thought this was like some, like, boomer shit.

706
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,500
Like, oh, you're old enough to drive?

707
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,860
You're old enough to go vote?

708
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,460
Vermont, Washington, when a kid's 18, he's old enough to drive.

709
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,579
Old enough to vote.

710
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,300
And old enough to worry about something most adults have.

711
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,179
Gingivitis.

712
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:48,820
An early reversible gum disease that left untreated could get serious.

713
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,099
Most adults have Gingivitis back in 1980?

714
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:53,059
Just ask your dentist.

715
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:55,780
Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine.

716
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,019
What?

717
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:59,780
The only non-prescription mouthwash accepted by the American Dental Association

718
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,420
for helping to prevent and reduce plaque and Gingivitis.

719
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:03,780
Yep.

720
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,019
If you're old enough to worry about gum disease,

721
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:08,099
you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.

722
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:09,300
Okay.

723
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,219
I want to try something different.

724
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:12,579
Can you make me look like that?

725
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:13,619
Tuesday, it's a brand new job.

726
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:15,059
100% of those residents have Gingivitis.

727
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:16,099
Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.

728
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:17,219
I'll go get the wand.

729
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:18,260
But she's the same old person.

730
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,420
100% of those residents.

731
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,619
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life slicing wire.

732
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,380
We all got chances, Elvis.

733
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,900
Some of them we just can't take.

734
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,019
In 1954, Vernon Presley wanted his son to have a steady job with a secure future.

735
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,139
His dream came true.

736
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:39,139
A special preview of Elvis, Tuesday.

737
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,699
Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th anniversary celebration will continue in a moment.

738
00:51:44,659 --> 00:51:45,860
You don't want, you don't get.

739
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,900
That's arithmetic.

740
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,860
Joe Kennedy.

741
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,659
He became the father of two senators and a president.

742
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:53,139
You're a very successful and wealthy man.

743
00:51:53,139 --> 00:51:54,340
Isn't that winning?

744
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,380
No, not yet.

745
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,539
He had an appetite for power.

746
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,179
For the first Irish Catholic ambassador to England.

747
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:01,460
Wealth and women.

748
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,500
I've never made history with anyone I've made love with.

749
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,619
How soon will you be home?

750
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:11,059
If there's any dirty work to be done, I'll be the one to do it.

751
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:13,219
The Kennedys of Massachusetts.

752
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:14,179
Two weeks from tonight.

753
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:24,500
Lexus LS400 looks like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.

754
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:42,159
It doesn't look LS400.

755
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,179
Nothing fucking funny even happens.

756
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:50,420
It's just a car just like slowly was zoomed in on and it's like enough to make me laugh.

757
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:53,139
Why do I think cars are so funny?

758
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:54,340
I don't know why.

759
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,179
I think it's because a lot of car companies treat cars like they're alive.

760
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,019
Like an animal or like it's a person or something.

761
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,420
To me, this is like a living being.

762
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,340
It's like, oh, look, there's like nobody in there in my brain for some reason.

763
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,539
It's like an elegantly.

764
00:53:12,539 --> 00:53:14,900
It just makes me laugh every time.

765
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,019
Because there's nobody in this car.

766
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,420
And it's just like moving around and look at how luxurious I am.

767
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,780
I'm a fucking car.

768
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,699
Much.

769
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:37,500
What about Herbotein?

770
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,139
That's what I'm saying.

771
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,039
You like seeing living beings getting hurt that the car crash is to you?

772
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:50,400
No.

773
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,239
The cookie and cracker sunshine makes has absolutely no cholesterol.

774
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:00,239
Now, what could be better than sunshine?

775
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:02,239
Have a little sunshine.

776
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,800
Have a little sunshine.

777
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,800
Have a little sunshine.

778
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,800
Pentagon Waste reaches the billions on 7 at 11.

779
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
No cholesterol in the cookie.

780
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,980
But, all right.

781
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,599
Producers of the show, the producers of the show was hoping you'd have a little more feeling of.

782
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,599
Wedding dress.

783
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,599
You know, a little more Mike Tyson.

784
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,599
You know, more Mike Tyson.

785
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,599
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, Sammy and I would like.

786
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:40,289
We keep seeing the beginning in the middle of all these things that the programming was.

787
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:42,289
Oh, yeah.

788
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:44,909
Rock music.

789
00:54:44,909 --> 00:54:54,059
Hey, Rizuchi.

790
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:56,059
Look a little pale.

791
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,059
Maybe he needs a doctor or something.

792
00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:05,789
Maybe I do.

793
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:10,909
Hey, don't look at me.

794
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:15,260
That was very confusing.

795
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,260
The car.

796
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,260
I'm laughing at that last one.

797
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,260
Bad timing that a car came on screen.

798
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:32,530
I'm laughing at that last commercial.

799
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,530
I'm laughing at that last commercial.

800
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:43,170
This is delicious, Danny.

801
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,170
What do you call it?

802
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,170
It's new ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.

803
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,170
So delicate.

804
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:51,170
What's it called?

805
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,170
Fresh Italian pasta sauce.

806
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,170
Yeah, it's really fresh, but what's the name?

807
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:57,170
Ragu uses less heavy tomato paste.

808
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,170
And twice the crushed tomatoes.

809
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:01,170
But what's the name?

810
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,170
Then total.

811
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,170
More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.

812
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:07,170
Here's a jar.

813
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,170
Look, it has the name on it.

814
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,170
Forget it.

815
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,170
They instantly turn on.

816
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,170
You put that show lead on, and that spark is right there.

817
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,170
That's the difference between a good dog and a great dog.

818
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,170
These are champions.

819
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,170
They deserve the best.

820
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,170
And I recommend Pedigree and Pedigree Meal Time.

821
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,170
Pedigree.

822
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,170
Recommended by top breeders.

823
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,170
And now there's a new kind of pedigree.

824
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,170
Pedigree Choice Cuts.

825
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,170
The sauce dogs can't resist.

826
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,170
One look shows you its choice.

827
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,170
One feeding shows you it's irresistible.

828
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,170
Pedigree Choice Cuts.

829
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:41,170
Recommended by top breeders.

830
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,170
My poor brother Tom.

831
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,170
Every time he tried to see what he was missing,

832
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,170
he would miss what he was seeing.

833
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,170
The dog did it too.

834
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,170
Then Tom got this amazing Magnavox

835
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,170
TV that lets him watch one show

836
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:55,170
while he checks out all the others on this

837
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,170
remarkable little window.

838
00:56:57,170 --> 00:56:59,170
Hey, that's a smart window, Dick.

839
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,170
They call it Tom?

840
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,170
No, no. They call it smart window Tom.

841
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,170
This was a big deal.

842
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,170
I kind of like Tom.

843
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:09,170
Magnavox. Smart choice.

844
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,170
Very smart.

845
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,170
The technology to do that was actually kind of crazy back in the day.

846
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,170
I am now officially a teenager.

847
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,170
It's DJ's first kiss.

848
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,170
13 candles.

849
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,170
An all new full house.

850
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:23,170
I'm 13!

851
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:25,170
Followed by a new Family Matters Friday.

852
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,170
All episodes.

853
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,170
Driving pretty.

854
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,170
Driving smart.

855
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:33,170
Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue

856
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,170
is saying something all new.

857
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,409
And it's all about comfort,

858
00:57:37,409 --> 00:57:39,409
style, and technology.

859
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:41,409
And Chrysler's exclusive crystal key

860
00:57:41,409 --> 00:57:43,409
owner program completes the package.

861
00:57:43,409 --> 00:57:45,409
This is so stupid.

862
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:47,409
I'm like pissed off at myself.

863
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:49,409
I'm laughing.

864
00:57:49,409 --> 00:57:51,409
It wasn't even funny.

865
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,409
It was funny.

866
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:55,409
It wasn't even what I was laughing at.

867
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:59,409
I actually wasn't even laughing at that.

868
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,409
I think I'm in love.

869
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:03,409
I was laughing at the guy

870
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:05,409
just absolutely sucking.

871
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:07,409
Just throwing that.

872
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:09,409
Just flipping it over there.

873
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,409
Like he just throws that shit.

874
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,409
And that's all I could focus on.

875
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:15,409
And it's all about comfort, style, and technology.

876
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,409
And Chrysler's exclusive

877
00:58:17,409 --> 00:58:19,409
crystal key owner program

878
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,409
completes the package.

879
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:23,409
All new Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

880
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:25,409
If the rebate goes up,

881
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,409
Chrysler will pay you the difference.

882
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:31,699
The difference.

883
00:58:31,699 --> 00:58:33,699
I think I'm in love.

884
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:35,699
They've got us unwrapped.

885
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:37,699
Out of your league.

886
00:58:37,699 --> 00:58:39,699
Yeah.

887
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:42,699
Watch.

888
00:58:42,699 --> 00:58:50,190
May I have a towel?

889
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,190
Recharge?

890
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,190
Never underestimate the doctor.

891
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,190
No. No.

892
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,190
Hi, excuse me. Are you French?

893
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,190
You look French. I love French food.

894
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:03,519
No, that's not what would have happened.

895
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:11,250
It would have gone like this.

896
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:15,150
This morning, I was following

897
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,150
a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.

898
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,150
I see Sears trucks all the time.

899
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:21,150
It also dawned on me that I hardly

900
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,150
ever see a service truck from those so-called

901
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,150
super stores.

902
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,150
So before you make that next big buying decision,

903
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:29,150
ask yourself what kind of service

904
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,150
you'll get five years from now.

905
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,150
Or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

906
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:35,150
That's one of the big reasons

907
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,150
I feel better when I buy a major appliance

908
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,150
or electronics from Sears.

909
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,150
And that's what they mean by your money's worth.

910
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,150
And a whole lot more.

911
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,150
Yeah. Yeah.

912
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:47,150
Know what a lot of today's teens are doing?

913
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,150
They're thinking.

914
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:51,150
About their futures and the future of Black America.

915
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,150
That's why once again,

916
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,150
McDonald's celebrates Black History Month

917
00:59:55,150 --> 00:59:57,150
by looking to the future.

918
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:59,150
Join us now as we salute our 1990

919
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,150
McDonald's Black History Makers of tomorrow.

920
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,150
These ten teens have been

921
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,150
selected because of their visions,

922
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,150
their dreams, and the roles they want to play

923
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:09,150
as leaders in America's future.

924
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,150
And someday they may truly have a place

925
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,150
in Black History.

926
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:18,019
Sears is gone.

927
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,449
This commercial

928
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:22,449
was awesome. I love every second of this commercial.

929
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:24,449
I remember this one.

930
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:32,179
Cake-sized Ritz Bitz

931
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:34,179
Peanut Butter Sandwiches.

932
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:36,179
The taste of Ritz Bitz and real peanut butter

933
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:38,179
in tiny sandwiches with no assembly

934
01:00:38,179 --> 01:00:40,179
required.

935
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,179
That part where it spins.

936
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:44,179
Hey, what's your name?

937
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:46,480
Monday.

938
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,489
MacGyver goes out on a limb

939
01:00:49,489 --> 01:00:51,489
to save the trees.

940
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:53,489
I can handle it.

941
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:55,489
MacGyver, then, based on a true story.

942
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,489
Daddy, you're alive!

943
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:59,489
The father who refused to let his family die.

944
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,489
I don't think he can. Are you sure?

945
01:01:01,489 --> 01:01:03,489
Robert Conrad, anything to survive.

946
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:05,489
Monday.

947
01:01:05,489 --> 01:01:07,489
I'm using this other long-distance company.

948
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:09,489
Try to call Phoenix. I miss dial feature.

949
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:11,489
I call the operator.

950
01:01:11,489 --> 01:01:13,489
She says she can't give me instant credit.

951
01:01:13,489 --> 01:01:15,489
I say AT&T always did.

952
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:17,489
She says you're not dealing with AT&T.

953
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:19,489
If you miss dealing with AT&T,

954
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:21,489
it's easier than ever to come back.

955
01:01:21,489 --> 01:01:23,489
Just call 1-800-582-1700 right now,

956
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:25,489
and we'll switch you back for free.

957
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,489
Come back?

958
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,489
They kept saying how much money I'd save.

959
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:31,489
Then I get the first bill?

960
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,489
I'm not kidding. I thought it was a title.

961
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,489
Give us a call anytime.

962
01:01:35,489 --> 01:01:37,489
People who thought they could do better than AT&T

963
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,489
are coming back for the real value.

964
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:41,489
You can too. It's simple.

965
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,489
Call now and come back for free.

966
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:45,489
Come back for free?

967
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:47,489
You have to pay?

968
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:49,489
What do you mean come back for free?

969
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,489
I couldn't believe it.

970
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:53,489
You're not dealing with AT&T.

971
01:01:53,489 --> 01:01:55,489
1-800-582-1700

972
01:01:55,489 --> 01:01:57,489
for dependable, crystal-clear

973
01:01:57,489 --> 01:01:59,489
AT&T long-distance service.

974
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:01,489
Call now and we'll switch you for free.

975
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:03,489
You couldn't pick a better time to come back.

976
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:05,489
I wonder if there was another promotion on top of that.

977
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:07,489
If you want an anti-lock braking system

978
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:09,489
like Mercedes,

979
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:11,489
a driver airbag like BMW,

980
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:13,489
a rear load-leveling suspension feature

981
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:15,489
similar to Rolls,

982
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:17,489
and a more advanced transmission

983
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:19,489
than Jaguar,

984
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:21,489
this is a simple way

985
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:23,489
to get it all.

986
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,489
Introducing the all-new Chrysler

987
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:27,489
Imperial.

988
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:29,489
There is no luxury without engineering.

989
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:31,489
Thank god it didn't move.

990
01:02:31,489 --> 01:02:33,489
The guaranteed rebate has been extended until February 28.

991
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,489
Thank god it didn't move.

992
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:37,659
Thank god it didn't move.

993
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:40,099
Thank god it didn't move.

994
01:02:40,099 --> 01:02:42,099
There's only one thing I used to hate worse

995
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:44,099
than having to wash out my pantyhose every night.

996
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:46,099
Trying not to laugh.

997
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:48,099
And that was having to throw them out.

998
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,099
Pantyhose that lasts are no nonsense.

999
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,099
I would lose.

1000
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:54,099
Ladies and gentlemen,

1001
01:02:54,099 --> 01:03:01,059
Dennis Miller.

1002
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:03,059
I just knew they'd call.

1003
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:05,059
I wish I wasn't so easily amused by cars.

1004
01:03:05,059 --> 01:03:08,579
It's almost as if someone once said,

1005
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:10,579
just in case people like sunshine and water,

1006
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,579
we'd better make Florida.

1007
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:14,579
And we'd better make miles of beautiful beaches

1008
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:16,579
and places like St. Augustine

1009
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:18,579
and Key West,

1010
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:20,579
just in case people want to go.

1011
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,579
There are over 4 million miles of roads

1012
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:24,579
in Alamo territory,

1013
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:26,579
all across America.

1014
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:28,579
And nationwide, only Alamo

1015
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:30,579
gives you all those miles for free.

1016
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:32,579
Including the ones that run through a state

1017
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:34,579
that's named after sunshine.

1018
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:37,260
Knowing how to read and write

1019
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,260
can really make you feel wanted.

1020
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,260
Trying so hard.

1021
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:43,260
Help someone learn to read.

1022
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,260
Volunteer as a tutor in your community.

1023
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,260
Tuesday.

1024
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,260
Hi.

1025
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,260
I've missed you.

1026
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,260
You're married.

1027
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:55,260
It's a second chance for love.

1028
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,260
What are we doing? We can't do this.

1029
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:59,260
I wish that you didn't have to go.

1030
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,260
I'm in love with you.

1031
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,260
30-something, Tuesday.

1032
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,260
The day may come when every free-standing range

1033
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,260
will have a smooth, sealed-in surface

1034
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,260
that's easy to clean

1035
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:11,260
and heats up this fast.

1036
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,260
But Whirlpool has it.

1037
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,260
Today.

1038
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,980
Hey, Mike, I really like this white Sinfandel.

1039
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,980
Well, good, good. Now put it down.

1040
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,980
I'm going to try another one.

1041
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,980
He loves to do this.

1042
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,980
This one's great. Yeah, I like it better.

1043
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,980
Why?

1044
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:32,980
Can't it just taste better, isn't that allowed?

1045
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,980
Did you know Gallimano White Sinfandel?

1046
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
No, it's terrific, isn't it?

1047
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,980
Am I going to get any credit for this?

1048
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,280
I didn't even make the wine.

1049
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,280
This is synonymous.

1050
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,280
Last year, I shopped at Alpha Beta,

1051
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,280
and now that it's switched over to Lucky's,

1052
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,280
I find a significant reduction

1053
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,280
in my weekly grocery bill.

1054
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
It's important that I have quality

1055
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
and affordable prices,

1056
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,280
and I find that I get both of that

1057
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
when I shop at Lucky's.

1058
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Alpha Beta is now Lucky.

1059
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,280
We think you'll like the change.

1060
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,280
All right.

1061
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Open 24 hours a day.

1062
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:37,780
I want a 10-minute breakfast,

1063
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,780
but you don't need a clock to time it.

1064
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,780
You don't need a clock. The waitress has a stopwatch.

1065
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,780
If her watch is stopped, how will I know when 10 minutes are up?

1066
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,780
Because if breakfast takes longer than 10 minutes,

1067
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,780
it's free.

1068
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,780
I get a broken watch for free.

1069
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,780
I'm talking about breakfast.

1070
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,780
And you've rambled on long enough, it's time to go eat at Lenny's.

1071
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:55,780
What?

1072
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,780
10 minutes?

1073
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,780
Now you can have your breakfast or lunch

1074
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,769
served in 10 minutes, or it's free.

1075
01:06:04,769 --> 01:06:06,769
Did they lose like $100 million in revenue

1076
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:08,769
for the two quarters they did this promotion?

1077
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:11,389
10 minutes?

1078
01:06:11,389 --> 01:06:14,269
What the fuck?

1079
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:16,510
That's so fast.

1080
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,510
It's

1081
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:22,420
where individuals become

1082
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,809
a family. It's where they share

1083
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:27,809
memories. 10 minutes? I can't

1084
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:30,690
believe that.

1085
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,690
It's where parents get to know their children

1086
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,889
and their children's children.

1087
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,889
This will always be an important part of people's

1088
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:39,889
lives. That's why home loans

1089
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:41,889
are such a secure investment.

1090
01:06:41,889 --> 01:06:43,889
And that's where Home Savings of America

1091
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:45,889
has put its depositors' money for more than

1092
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:50,050
100 years.

1093
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,050
Juice!

1094
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,050
Quiet, please.

1095
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,989
Hold on.

1096
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:58,989
When allergies come on

1097
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:00,989
this strong, Benadryl

1098
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:06,110
comes on stronger.

1099
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:09,380
Time!

1100
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,380
Sorry, sorry. My nose won't

1101
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,380
stop running. When allergies

1102
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,380
come on this strong, Benadryl

1103
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,380
comes on stronger.

1104
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,550
A change is coming.

1105
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,550
It's understood.

1106
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,550
Happening all over my neighborhood.

1107
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:26,110
Only it's got the taste

1108
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,110
for me. Gonna change the

1109
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,110

Pizza Hut delivery, making it great.

1118

What is?

1119
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,110
I'm still on the Denny's thing.

1120
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,110
What if you

1121
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,110
after the big baseball game,

1122
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,110
like a little league baseball game

1123
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,110
you go into

1124
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,110
Denny's with like 40 people.

1125
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:03,440
Is that every single person?

1126
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,320
How would

1127
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,320
it just gonna be free?

1128
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,199
Hey guys, we're gonna take the entire

1129
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:13,199
baseball team and the other team

1130
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,199
and we're gonna go to Denny's and it's probably

1131
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,869
just gonna be free. That's kinda crazy.

1132
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:21,869
How would they do that?

1133
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,949
It's here. Trying is believing week.

1134
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:30,949
And here's how people who are trying breakfast

1135
01:08:30,949 --> 01:08:32,949
with Grape Nuts feel. You've gotta try

1136
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:34,949
it. I did and I feel great.

1137
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:36,949
It's a great

1138
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:38,949
natural energy source and it's fat

1139
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,949
free. You won't believe how good you

1140
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:43,189
feel. I do.

1141
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:45,189
I feel great. Grape Nuts

1142
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:47,189
cereal is full of complex carbohydrates.

1143
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,189
You won't believe how it helps keep you going

1144
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:51,189
all morning. Look for this display in your

1145
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,189
store. Post Grape Nuts trying is

1146
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:55,189
Be careful you don't knock the fucking thing over

1147
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:57,189
because it's literally a house of hearts.

1148
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:09,189
I haven't had Grape Nuts in a long time.

1149
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:11,189
I remember them being really good

1150
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,189
but I feel like the fake memory.

1151
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,739
I think we saw.

1152
01:09:27,739 --> 01:09:29,739
Did we see that one?

1153
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:31,739
Where they were like fucking flies

1154
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:33,739
all over the place.

1155
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,739
I think we saw. Did we see that one?

1156
01:09:51,739 --> 01:09:53,739
Where they were like fucking flies

1157
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:55,739
all over the place.

1158
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:57,739
What was it?

1159
01:09:57,739 --> 01:09:59,739
I don't know. I feel like I've seen that one.

1160
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:10,539
That would be so fucked up.

1161
01:10:18,539 --> 01:10:20,539
Does he think that they're bugs?

1162
01:10:20,539 --> 01:10:23,289
It's a bunch of flies.

1163
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:30,329
That's so ridiculous.

1164
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:35,640
That's classic comedy right there.

1165
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,640
So they're the same.

1166
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
Don't you get it?

1167
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,640
Ritz or Ritz Bits. Two sizes fits all.

1168
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,819
They're all laughing.

1169
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,569
No car.

1170
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:50,229
Oh, it's actually for a...

1171
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:21,939
Oh, this is a long one.

1172
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:27,939
This is a long one.

1173
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,939
This is a good one though.

1174
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:47,939
Stop having fun.

1175
01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:51,939
Call this number.

1176
01:12:51,939 --> 01:12:53,939
And we'll give you an incentive to find out.

1177
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:55,939
A certificate worth $10

1178
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:57,939
toward a consultation visit with your doctor.

1179
01:12:57,939 --> 01:13:01,939
Call 1-800-556-4800.

1180
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:07,960
I gotta pee. Let me pause it.

1181
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,960
I've been drinking water. I'll be right back.

1182
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,260
We'll pick this back up in a sec.

1183
01:13:12,260 --> 01:14:11,210
Actually, I just got sent a link

1184
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:13,829
saying that you should watch this one

1185
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,829
which is kind of interesting.

1186
01:14:15,829 --> 01:14:22,810
I haven't seen this one yet.

1187
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:27,100
Interestingly enough.

1188
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:43,210
Okay, well, let's watch it.

1189
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,180
Oh, no way.

1190
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,180
Then I summon...

1191
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:43,899
Meowty!

1192
01:15:43,899 --> 01:15:48,890
The two-player starter kit contains

1193
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,890
everything you need and more

1194
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:52,890
to get right into the action.

1195
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:54,890
Master the arts of grottos, beasts, and wishes.

1196
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,890
With 200 different cards,

1197
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,890
you must choose your challenger wisely.

1198
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,890
Hey, mister.

1199
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,890
Will you stop doing that?

1200
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,890
Uh, oh.

1201
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:13,800
You can even call upon my power.

1202
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,800
So craft the strongest deck you can.

1203
01:16:20,859 --> 01:16:22,859
Grotto beasts, available now.

1204
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:24,859
Starter kit and booster pack sold separately.

1205
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:26,859
Order while supplies last.

1206
01:16:26,859 --> 01:16:36,840
Well, that was a weird one.

1207
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:39,210
That was an interesting one.

1208
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:44,310
You have no idea

1209
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,550
how hard it was to shut the fuck up about this.

1210
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:49,430
It was so hard to not talk about this.

1211
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:06,250
Weird. I...

1212
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,250
This would show up today, of all times.

1213
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:14,579
Should we watch it again?

1214
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:16,579
I think we watch it again.

1215
01:17:16,579 --> 01:17:32,180
Let's watch it again.

1216
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,659
The two-player starter kit contains

1217
01:18:19,659 --> 01:18:21,659
everything you need and more

1218
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,659
to get right into the action.

1219
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:25,659
Master the arts of grottos,

1220
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:32,630
beasts, and wishes.

1221
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:37,689
With 200 different cards,

1222
01:18:37,689 --> 01:18:39,689
you must choose your challenger wisely.

1223
01:18:39,689 --> 01:18:41,689
Hey, mister.

1224
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:43,689
Will you stop doing that?

1225
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:45,689
Uh, oh.

1226
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:47,689
The two-player starter kit contains

1227
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,689
everything you need and more

1228
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:51,689
to get right into the action.

1229
01:18:51,689 --> 01:18:53,689
Master the arts of grottos, beasts, and wishes.

1230
01:18:53,689 --> 01:19:00,659
You can even call upon my power.

1231
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:02,659
You can even call upon my power.

1232
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,659
So craft the strongest deck you can.

1233
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,720
Grotto beasts, available now.

1234
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,720
Grotto beasts, available now.

1235
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,720
Starter kit and booster pack sold separately.

1236
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,720
Order while supplies last.

1237
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:22,119
Alright.

1238
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:24,300
Let's talk about it for a second.

1239
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,600
A lot of people worked on this.

1240
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,600
We have credits

1241
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,600
that I want to put up.

1242
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,779
That was Studio

1243
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:35,659
Yada that did the animation work.

1244
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:38,409
And they did an unbelievably

1245
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:43,399
phenomenal job.

1246
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:45,399
Absolutely beautiful.

1247
01:19:45,399 --> 01:19:50,329
And then the live action

1248
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:52,949
portion was

1249
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:57,430
produced by Indie Film Factory,

1250
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,430
which is a local group of Vegas

1251
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:02,180
filmmakers. So it was

1252
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,180
a long process

1253
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:06,619
to get this out here, but this was

1254
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:08,619
part of the reason to do the project anyways.

1255
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:10,979
They're going to have this

1256
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:14,180
90s parody

1257
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,420
kind of world. And hopefully

1258
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:18,420
this commercial

1259
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,420
took a lot of work.

1260
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:28,170
Hope you enjoyed it. Long process.

1261
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:35,189
But yeah, let me show this

1262
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:37,750
real quick. I want to make sure that the people

1263
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,750
that did spend a bunch of time on this

1264
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,750
get some recognition for it because

1265
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,989
it was phenomenal. Let me put it on screen.

1266
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:50,949
Let me just get it.

1267
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:52,949
Hopefully it fits. There's a lot of names on this list.

1268
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,960
All very important.

1269
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,960
The video will be public

1270
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,960
on the Grotto Beasts YouTube channel.

1271
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:06,680
I'm so happy. I'm so glad

1272
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:11,670
to actually show that. And yeah, Grotto Beasts

1273
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,670
is out.

1274
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:15,670
It's available. I want to make

1275
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,670
sure I give a meaningful update to

1276
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,229
that. We had a couple

1277
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:22,470
of small shipping issues.

1278
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,470
But they're actively being investigated.

1279
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:26,649
And a lot of people have gotten their orders.

1280
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:28,649
We've seen a ton of people that have opened cards.

1281
01:21:28,649 --> 01:21:31,579
And we're

1282
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:33,579
so happy that people actually like it.

1283
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:35,750
That was a huge

1284
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,989
amount of stress over the last

1285
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:39,989
six plus months is making sure like

1286
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:42,489
fuck, I hope people like it. I really do.

1287
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:44,489
But a lot of people have been getting their orders.

1288
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:46,489
Seems like people think it's fun.

1289
01:21:46,489 --> 01:21:48,489
And interesting. Which

1290
01:21:48,489 --> 01:21:50,489
that is a huge weight off of everybody's

1291
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:52,489
shoulders. Because it was like, fuck, hopefully people actually like

1292
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:56,390
this. And no, the cards are not

1293
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:00,279
edible. Oh, let me see.

1294
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:05,779
Alright, let me get this shown. Here

1295
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:11,220
are the credits. Lots

1296
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,979
of work went into it.

1297
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:19,859
Here you go. Huge thank you to every

1298
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:21,859
single person on this list. From the people at

1299
01:22:21,859 --> 01:22:23,859
Indie Film Factory to obviously

1300
01:22:23,859 --> 01:22:25,859
Holly to Studio Yotta. All the

1301
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,859
people that came together to make what you just

1302
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:29,859
watched actually watchable.

1303
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:36,069
We're thinking of maybe

1304
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:38,069
putting up a clean version

1305
01:22:38,069 --> 01:22:43,189
that doesn't have kind of the crust on it.

1306
01:22:43,189 --> 01:22:51,750
There it is.

1307
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,750
There will be a no crust clean version

1308
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:57,210
uploaded. Obviously for this stream

1309
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,510
I wanted to, you know, we wanted to

1310
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,819
make sure it was like 90s and

1311
01:23:01,819 --> 01:23:05,270
80s kind of aesthetic.

1312
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:09,689
Bugleberry as himself.

1313
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:14,810
Crust is great. Oh yeah.

1314
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:21,510
Tomar, oh yeah. They were awesome

1315
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:25,989
to work with too. It's a swell group

1316
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:32,779
over there. Yeah, both versions will be

1317
01:23:32,779 --> 01:23:34,779
uploaded. The Grotto Beast YouTube will upload

1318
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:37,779
both of them. But now,

1319
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,539
now I actually am going to take a

1320
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:43,739
BRB. Because I want to get some water

1321
01:23:43,739 --> 01:23:45,739
and we'll put the other ads back up.

1322
01:23:45,739 --> 01:23:54,569
BRB, I'll see you guys in a minute.

1323
01:23:54,569 --> 01:27:38,310
I keep forgetting to play the BRB music.

1324
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:49,960
I have it. I just keep forgetting to press the button.

1325
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:53,859
Oh, sorry I scared you. But um,

1326
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:55,859
yeah, let's go back to watch

1327
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,859
more 80s and 90s ads.

1328
01:27:57,859 --> 01:27:59,859
You just saw one.

1329
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:07,720
Remember next time.

1330
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,720
Yeah, it's, we could probably get a like

1331
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,659
grottobeasts.net if you have

1332
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:15,609
no idea what we're even talking about.

1333
01:28:15,609 --> 01:28:17,979
Sort of a parody 90s

1334
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:20,729
card game that is

1335
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:22,899
essentially being treated as streamer merch.

1336
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:25,850
It's got a game built on top of it.

1337
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:35,819
It's available now. Why didn't you

1338
01:28:35,819 --> 01:28:37,819
turn into a car during the commercial?

1339
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:42,470
Alright.

1340
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:45,930
Let's, this

1341
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:47,930
compilation was pretty good. We'll stay on this one

1342
01:28:47,930 --> 01:29:05,140
for a little bit. Asking the real questions.

1343
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:10,840
Yeah. Okay. You ready?

1344
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,840
Does old Old Spice

1345
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,840
smell the same as new Old Spice?

1346
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,840
By the way.

1347
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,210
I feel like it probably does.

1348
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:55,510
What?

1349
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,510
I would get out of that

1350
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:59,510
car. I would get out.

1351
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:01,510
I would get out.

1352
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:11,510
Hold on.

1353
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,510
This lady is facing this way?

1354
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,510
How?

1355
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:20,390
What seat is this lady

1356
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:22,390
sitting in over here on the left, on the right?

1357
01:30:24,699 --> 01:30:26,699
Wait. I'm so confused.

1358
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:32,149
Aren't you glad you used dials?

1359
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:34,149
To the airport. Let's go.

1360
01:30:34,149 --> 01:30:36,149
Don't you wish everybody did?

1361
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:40,149
She's standing?

1362
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:42,149
I'm confused.

1363
01:30:42,149 --> 01:30:44,149
There's not enough room to do that.

1364
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:58,149
Look at this thing. It's a magazine.

1365
01:30:58,149 --> 01:31:00,149
TDC magazine.

1366
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:02,149
I open it up and there's this

1367
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:04,149
grid, which is great because I can see the whole

1368
01:31:04,149 --> 01:31:06,149
week at a glance. So I just circle

1369
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:08,149
the shows I want to see. Alright.

1370
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:10,149
And look at this. It's a complete description

1371
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:12,149
of every single show. And check this

1372
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:14,149
out. These photographs.

1373
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:16,149
Gorgeous. There's even articles

1374
01:31:16,149 --> 01:31:18,149
by famous authors. Amazing.

1375
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:20,149
All I expected was a program

1376
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:22,149
guide and I get all this? What a bargain.

1377
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:24,149
I wonder if there will ever be a

1378
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:26,149
swimsuit issue.

1379
01:31:26,149 --> 01:31:28,149
This is the kind of thing that

1380
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,149
dad leaves a voicemail

1381
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:32,149
for you about. I've got this

1382
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:34,149
magazine. I'm telling you. You're going to love it.

01:31:34,149 --> 01:31:36,149
It's got all this educational stuff. You can circle your

1384
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:38,149
television shows. Call me back

1385
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:40,149

TDC magazine and receive 12 monthly

1387
01:31:42,149 --> 01:31:44,149
issues for only $14.95.

1388
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:46,149
That's more than 50% off the cover

1389
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:48,149
price. Or tell the operator to bill you

1390
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:50,149
later. Visa and MasterCard accepted.

1391
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:52,149
Is it Peter Griffin?

1392
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:54,149
Get all this?

1393
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:56,149
My famous authors.

1394
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:58,149
Amazing. All I expected was a program

1395
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:00,149
guide and I get all this? What a

1396
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:02,149
bargain.

1397
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:04,149
I wonder if there will ever be a

1398
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:06,149
swimsuit issue. Call now.

1399
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:08,149
That's a stretch.

1400
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:10,149
12 monthly issues for only $14.95.

1401
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:12,149
That's more than 50%

1402
01:32:12,149 --> 01:32:14,149
off the cover price. Or tell the operator

1403
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:16,149
to bill you later. Visa and MasterCard

1404
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:18,149
accepted.

1405
01:32:18,149 --> 01:32:20,149
There's never one food that gives you

1406
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:22,149
what you need. It's the combination

1407
01:32:22,149 --> 01:32:24,149
and the balance. And how you balance the

1408
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:26,149
combinations. So at McDonald's, there's

1409
01:32:26,149 --> 01:32:28,149
lots to choose from. Lean burgers

1410
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:30,149
to low fat shakes and frozen yogurt.

1411
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:32,149
Salads. No fat, no cholesterol.

1412
01:32:32,149 --> 01:32:34,149
Apple brand muffins. I got

1413
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:36,149
muffins at McDonald's? When? Chicken, potatoes,

1414
01:32:36,149 --> 01:32:38,149
and fish. We've got a long list of good

1415
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:40,149
foods to choose from. All

1416
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:42,149
you've got to do is just choose the food.

1417
01:32:42,149 --> 01:32:44,149
When were they muffins? That sounds amazing.

1418
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:46,149
Always good food. Always good value.

1419
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:48,149
At McDonald's.

1420
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:50,460
It can be downright frustrating

1421
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,460
and difficult to get

1422
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:54,460
perfect orange juice. One with

1423
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,460
that pure fresh squeeze taste.

1424
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,460
They did this on that Guy Fieri

1425
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:02,229
game show. But if you remember

1426
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:04,229
juice comes closer to this.

1427
01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:06,229
This. Tropicana

1428
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:08,229
Pure Premium. We think you'll

1429
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:10,229
find everything will just fall

1430
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:12,229
into place.

1431
01:33:12,229 --> 01:33:14,229
Tropicana Pure

1432
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:16,229
Premium. He missed almost all of them so he's not going to

1433
01:33:16,229 --> 01:33:18,229
get the $10,000 or whatever it was.

1434
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:23,529
Responsible.

1435
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:25,529
Just because the other guy is

1436
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:27,529
on the road doesn't mean his mind

1437
01:33:27,529 --> 01:33:29,529
is. So the superb traction

1438
01:33:29,529 --> 01:33:31,529
of the Subaru Legacy with four

1439
01:33:31,529 --> 01:33:33,529
wheel drive and anti-lock brakes

1440
01:33:33,529 --> 01:33:35,529
can be quite a comfort. Since

1441
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:37,529
the next guy is capable of almost

1442
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:39,529
anything. Shouldn't the same be true

1443
01:33:39,529 --> 01:33:42,789
of your next car?

1444
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:44,789
So the superb

1445
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:46,789
traction of the Subaru Legacy with four wheel drive

1446
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:48,789
and anti-lock brakes

1447
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,789
can be quite a comfort.

1448
01:33:50,789 --> 01:33:53,670
My god dude.

1449
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:55,670
He's wearing these like

1450
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:57,670
blackout shades and

1451
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,670
no audio. He just got

1452
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:01,670
to know what he's doing.

1453
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,670
And by the way

1454
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:05,670
what a scary stunt

1455
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,670
person. This stuntman.

1456
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,670
I would be shitting my pants.

1457
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,670
Look at how close the car comes.

1458
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:14,739
It doesn't even flinch.

1459
01:34:14,739 --> 01:34:17,239
The four wheel drive and anti-lock brakes can be

1460
01:34:17,239 --> 01:34:19,539
quite a comfort. Since the next guy

1461
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:21,779
is capable of almost anything.

1462
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:23,779
Shouldn't the same be true of your next car?

1463
01:34:23,779 --> 01:34:27,880
Factory to dealer cash could mean

1464
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,880
great savings to you during the Subaru

1465
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,880
Spring Value Days.

1466
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,880
Three hours, nine minutes. May I ask

1467
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,880
what you're doing? Timing tiny time

1468
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,880
pills. Excuse me? Well this morning when I woke up I

1469
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,880
talked like this and that. So I took

1470
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,880
a contact. So well contact

1471
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,880
has 600 tiny time pills that last 12 hours.

1472
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,880
Up to three times longer than ordinary cold

1473
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,880
medicine. There's a whole day's

1474
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,880
work in every contact.

1475
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:51,880
Eight hours and 30 seconds.

1476
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,880
Look if you're going to time the tiny time

1477
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,880
pills all day when are you going to do the work?

1478
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,880
Right. You time.

1479
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,880
There's a whole day's

1480
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,880
work in every contact. What did he close?

1481
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:04,180
You're going to time the

1482
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,180
tiny time pills all day when are you going to do the work?

1483
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,420
Right.

1484
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:11,050
You time.

1485
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:13,050
There's a whole day's work in every contact.

1486
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:15,050
Coming to ABC. I saw his hand up in the, both hands

1487
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,050
in the air. No way. Two years

1488
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:19,050
tops. Three. Two and a half. Three or no deal.

1489
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:21,050
Done. He put both his hands up and then

1490
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:23,050
he closed the drawer. Was that his stomach?

1491
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:25,050
You said you took on the cases

1492
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,050
nobody else wanted.

1493
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:31,590
Witnesses. Fail

1494
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:35,239
tonight. Oh your honor. Got a big problem here.

1495
01:35:35,239 --> 01:35:37,239
Treat Williams. You mean you

1496
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:39,239
are a real lawyer? Surprise.

1497
01:35:39,239 --> 01:35:41,239
Eddie Dodd. Premiering this week on ABC

1498
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:43,239
TV. Oh that'll fix the case.

1499
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:45,239
Down here. We got a problem

1500
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,239
here.

1501
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:49,239
Yeah.

1502
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:51,239
The sentence is final by the way.

1503
01:35:51,239 --> 01:35:53,239
Lifetime. No wonder many of us seem

1504
01:35:53,239 --> 01:35:55,239
to always. Pacific Bell calling card.

1505
01:35:55,239 --> 01:35:57,239
You can easily charge

1506
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:59,239
calls. Wherever you are.

1507
01:35:59,239 --> 01:36:02,310
Just down the street.

1508
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:04,310
Or somewhere up the coast.

1509
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,619
But unlike most calling cards

1510
01:36:06,619 --> 01:36:08,619
Pacific Bell

1511
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:10,619
is based on your own familiar phone

1512
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:12,619
number. And since it's welcome

1513
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:14,619
at most every phone

1514
01:36:14,619 --> 01:36:16,619
it's really the only calling card you need

1515
01:36:16,619 --> 01:36:18,619
to hang on to. Pacific

1516
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:20,619
Bell. We're making things easier.

1517
01:36:20,619 --> 01:36:25,859
Everywhere.

1518
01:36:25,859 --> 01:36:27,859
Fifty years.

1519
01:36:27,859 --> 01:36:29,859
McDonald's explodes another myth.

1520
01:36:29,859 --> 01:36:31,859
If it's low fat it can't be delicious.

1521
01:36:31,859 --> 01:36:33,859
Not so.

1522
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,859
Introducing McLean Deluxe. Made with a

1523
01:36:35,859 --> 01:36:37,859
91% fat free beef patty.

1524
01:36:37,859 --> 01:36:39,859
Low fat and delicious. There's no way that tastes good.

1525
01:36:39,859 --> 01:36:41,859
Can't be done. Can't be done. Can too.

1526
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:43,859
You wanted great burger taste with a lot less

1527
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:45,859
fat. Only McDonald's responded.

1528
01:36:45,859 --> 01:36:47,859
New McLean Deluxe will blow you away.

1529
01:36:47,859 --> 01:36:49,859
It's terrific. It can't

1530
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:51,859
be low fat. It can't be. It's both.

1531
01:36:51,859 --> 01:36:53,859
New McLean Deluxe after billions

1532
01:36:53,859 --> 01:36:55,859
and billions. Another first at McDonald's

1533
01:36:55,859 --> 01:36:58,680
today. That went on the

1534
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,680
menu and off the menu in three weeks.

1535
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:07,449
Make me touch me.

1536
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:15,380
Touch me of you. Wait what's

1537
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,380
happening? Wait.

1538
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,380
What? Oh.

1539
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:26,359
For skin salt is the day you were

1540
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:30,520
born.

1541
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,520
Now it's gonna be

1542
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,520
Are you gonna give

1543
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,520
your love to me?

1544
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,520
They turned her into

1545
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,520
oil.

1546
01:37:44,659 --> 01:37:46,970
Meet the Kodak Colorkin toys.

1547
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,970
Get them free by mail when you buy these

1548
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:50,970
Kodak products. See this displayed

1549
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,970
for colors you can love.

1550
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,970
I love the real not fade away.

1551
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,970
Big

1552
01:37:58,970 --> 01:38:00,970
odors lurk in small places.

1553
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,970
Big odors linger in small places.

1554
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,970
A huge door.

1555
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:08,970
Wait why is the toilet so big?

1556
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,970
A new decorative design and a great new scent.

1557
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,970
The toilet was huge.

1558
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,210
My friend Carol is so

1559
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:17,210
different from me. She does lunchables

1560
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,210
all at once.

1561
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:21,210
But I do it one by one. Wait what the

1562
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:23,210
fuck? What are you doing?

1563
01:38:23,210 --> 01:38:25,210
Oh hold on.

1564
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,210
What are you doing?

1565
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,579
My friend Carol

1566
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:31,579
is so different from me.

1567
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:33,579
She's just like

1568
01:38:33,579 --> 01:38:35,579
I'm confused what's happening here.

1569
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:37,579
She does lunchables all at once.

1570
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,579
But I do it one by one.

1571
01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:41,579
We're total opposites.

1572
01:38:41,579 --> 01:38:43,579
But we've been best friends forever.

1573
01:38:43,579 --> 01:38:45,579
Oscar Meyer lunchables lunch combinations.

1574
01:38:45,579 --> 01:38:47,579
Lunchables?

1575
01:38:47,579 --> 01:38:49,579
Did they start to market them to adults?

1576
01:38:49,579 --> 01:38:51,579
I don't remember that.

1577
01:38:51,579 --> 01:38:53,579
It can't be delicious.

1578
01:38:53,579 --> 01:38:55,579
Not so. Introducing McLean Deluxe.

1579
01:38:55,579 --> 01:38:57,579
Made with a 91%

1580
01:38:57,579 --> 01:38:59,579
fat free beef patty.

1581
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:01,579
Low fat and delicious? Can't be done.

1582
01:39:01,579 --> 01:39:03,579
And two. You wanted great burger

1583
01:39:03,579 --> 01:39:05,579
taste with a lot less fat.

1584
01:39:05,579 --> 01:39:07,579
Only McDonald's responded. New McLean

1585
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:09,579
Deluxe will blow you away.

1586
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:11,579
It's terrific. It can't be low fat.

1587
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:13,579
It's both. New McLean

1588
01:39:13,579 --> 01:39:15,579
Deluxe after billions and billions.

1589
01:39:15,579 --> 01:39:17,579
Another first at McDonald's today.

1590
01:39:17,579 --> 01:39:20,329
Oh. Wait they're gonna

1591
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:22,329
I thought they were gonna

1592
01:39:22,329 --> 01:39:24,329
snap this lady back.

1593
01:39:24,329 --> 01:39:26,329
Alright we're getting repeats.

1594
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:28,329
We're getting repeats.

1595
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:32,039
I thought they were gonna snap

1596
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:41,000
her back.

1597
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,270
Oh. Repeats.

1598
01:39:57,939 --> 01:39:59,939
Mother Goose?

1599
01:40:05,939 --> 01:40:07,939
Playful pictures too.

1600
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:09,939
Eleven designs in every package.

1601
01:40:09,939 --> 01:40:11,939
Now Sam and Samantha are

1602
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:13,939
full of glee in new story time.

1603
01:40:13,939 --> 01:40:15,939
Lotus lately absent for your tea.

1604
01:40:15,939 --> 01:40:17,939
Here it comes.

1605
01:40:17,939 --> 01:40:20,310
No.

1606
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,310
I skipped right into a sneeze.

1607
01:40:26,409 --> 01:40:34,220
Here it comes.

1608
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:36,220
Allergies come on this strong.

1609
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:38,220
Were they gonna kick her out? Stronger.

1610
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:44,300
This. Okay.

1611
01:40:44,300 --> 01:41:01,579
Okay.

1612
01:41:01,579 --> 01:41:03,579
Cheezer, cheezer, cheezer. Not one

1613
01:41:03,579 --> 01:41:05,579
but two pizzas loaded with cheese and

1614
01:41:05,579 --> 01:41:07,579
up to five toppings for $8.98.

1615
01:41:07,579 --> 01:41:09,939
Cheezer, cheezer. Okay.

1616
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:11,939
Bravely Fred has faced one too many healthy

1617
01:41:11,939 --> 01:41:13,939
but boring breakfast. Enough.

1618
01:41:13,939 --> 01:41:15,939
I want taste indulgence.

1619
01:41:15,939 --> 01:41:17,939
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.

1620
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:19,939
Oh Fred.

1621
01:41:19,939 --> 01:41:21,939
Naughty Frosted.

1622
01:41:21,939 --> 01:41:23,939
Ready. Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats

1623
01:41:23,939 --> 01:41:25,939
are good for you. There's fiber.

1624
01:41:25,939 --> 01:41:27,939
No. And no salt.

1625
01:41:27,939 --> 01:41:29,939
But they taste so good.

1626
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:31,939
And they're fat free. See? Fat free?

1627
01:41:31,939 --> 01:41:33,939
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats. Sinner.

1628
01:41:33,939 --> 01:41:35,939
Surprise. They're good for you.

1629
01:41:35,939 --> 01:41:37,939
You see it your way. Sinner.

1630
01:41:37,939 --> 01:41:40,380
I see it mine.

1631
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:42,380
We're all going to Italy. Tuesday when Tony

1632
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,380
inherits a vineyard. Greetings fellow

1633
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,380
villagers. He's welcomed with

1634
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,380
fresh fruit. Who's the boss?

1635
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:50,380
And at a special time. What?

1636
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:52,380
That's a chemistry set. Every

1637
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,380
boy should have one. No you shouldn't

1638
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:56,380
have done that Ed. We could just turn on the gas

1639
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,380
and blow ourselves up. An hour of

1640
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,380
Rosanne. Ed. I flew here this morning

1641
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,380
from Colombia. A dope smuggler

1642
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,380
swallows his stage. If somebody dies

1643
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:06,380
it's not your fault is it? No. Not totally.

1644
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:08,380
What percentage would you say?

1645
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:10,380
Stand. Tuesday.

1646
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,380
What?

1647
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:14,380
What? What?

1648
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:16,380
What?

1649
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,939
What?

1650
01:42:18,939 --> 01:42:20,939
No. I don't

1651
01:42:20,939 --> 01:42:22,939
want to see this person get snapped out of existence

1652
01:42:22,939 --> 01:42:25,180
again. Wait. It's a different

1653
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,180
person?

1654
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,180
It's a different person.

1655
01:42:34,939 --> 01:42:36,939
I just like choked on my spit.

1656
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:50,359
That was rude.

1657
01:42:50,359 --> 01:42:56,250
That was sick. I'm telling you

1658
01:42:56,250 --> 01:43:03,100
I see somebody do

1659
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,100
this. I'm going to be like

1660
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:07,590
nice job.

1661
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:15,590
Nice job. I was just waiting

1662
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:26,470
for that guy to do the stomach thing.

1663
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:43,859
Lucky. Your mother will make a

1664
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:45,859
ride of golden twirls to go with them.

1665
01:43:45,859 --> 01:43:47,859
True. Golden twirls are very

1666
01:43:47,859 --> 01:43:49,859
delicious and so much fun.

1667
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:52,420
I wonder how they grow these.

1668
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:54,420
True.

1669
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:56,420
The average driver puts 12 to 13,000 miles

1670
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:58,420
a year on a car. At Saturn

1671
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,420
we knew this.

1672
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,420
Where and how though is anyone's guess.

1673
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:04,420
For sure we knew people

1674
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:06,420
would be taking the new Saturn places.

1675
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,420
And using it in ways

1676
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,420
you'd never figure.

1677
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:12,420
Or even imagine.

1678
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,420
So we tested it.

1679
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:16,420
We ran it six million miles.

1680
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:18,420
Six million?

1681
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:24,890
Like a hundred thousand miles

1682
01:44:24,890 --> 01:44:26,890
on a car considered to be

1683
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:28,890
getting kind of up there.

1684
01:44:28,890 --> 01:44:30,890
Six million?

1685
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,890
Unpleasant as it might be

1686
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:34,890
it was time to break a heart.

1687
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:36,890
Would you go with me?

1688
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,890
Depends on the car.

1689
01:44:38,890 --> 01:44:40,890
It's a growing pains European holiday

1690
01:44:40,890 --> 01:44:42,890
and Mike's getting a head start.

1691
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:44,890
Party! Party!

1692
01:44:44,890 --> 01:44:46,890
It's a tale of two vacations.

1693
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,890
Happy anniversary.

1694
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,890
I'm stranded in Spain with a crazy woman.

1695
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:52,890
Catch all the fun Wednesday.

1696
01:44:52,890 --> 01:44:55,260
What?

1697
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,260
Critics are saying McDonald's

1698
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,260
new McLean Deluxe is revolutionary.

1699
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,260
That's because it's made with the leanest

1700
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,260
beef patty in the business.

1701
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:05,260
91% fat free.

1702
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:07,260
They're calling it phenomenal.

1703
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:09,260
That's because it tastes fantastic.

1704
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,260
The public demanded McDonald's responded

1705
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:13,260
with less fat. But don't fill up on the press.

1706
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:15,260
Taste for yourself.

1707
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:17,260
One bite and you'll be talking about it too.

1708
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:19,260
The swallow first. New McLean Deluxe

1709
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:21,260
after billions and billions.

1710
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:23,260
Another first at McDonald's today.

1711
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:25,619
What did that taste like?

1712
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:27,619
Bradley decided to express his artistic

1713
01:45:27,619 --> 01:45:29,619
talent on the living room wall.

1714
01:45:29,619 --> 01:45:31,619
Glitten will cover it in one coat.

1715
01:45:31,619 --> 01:45:33,619
They're so cute at that age.

1716
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,619
That's so much of one brand of paint.

1717
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:37,619
Of one color of paint.

1718
01:45:37,619 --> 01:45:39,619
Are you sure you have everything?

1719
01:45:39,619 --> 01:45:41,619
Hmm. I got the

1720
01:45:41,619 --> 01:45:43,619
Fujifilm while you were in cosmetics.

1721
01:45:43,619 --> 01:45:45,619
I didn't forget. Oh.

1722
01:45:45,619 --> 01:45:47,619
You forgot you married the perfect husband.

1723
01:45:47,619 --> 01:45:49,619
You were right, Dad. Kmart's pretty cool.

1724
01:45:49,619 --> 01:45:51,619
You should listen to me more often.

1725
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:53,619
Wait. Hold on.

1726
01:45:53,619 --> 01:45:55,619
Oh, it's not for the paint.

1727
01:45:55,619 --> 01:45:57,619
It's individual candid conversations

1728
01:45:57,619 --> 01:46:01,590
caught on camera.

1729
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:03,590
Bradley decided to express his

1730
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:05,590
artistic talent on the living room wall.

1731
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:08,090
This kind of looks like

1732
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:11,289
mac and cheese containers.

1733
01:46:11,289 --> 01:46:15,000
That's a real brand?

1734
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Glitten will cover it in one coat. Boom Mike?

1735
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,750
Hold on. No, no, no. Where?

1736
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:21,750
Oh, shit. Where were we?

1737
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:23,750
Turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.

1738
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,750
Where was it?

1739
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,750
Artistic talent

1740
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:29,750
on the living room wall.

1741
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,750
There it is. Boom Mike?

1742
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,680
New McLean Deluxe

1743
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,680
after billions and billions.

1744
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:44,329
Another first at McDonald's today.

1745
01:46:44,329 --> 01:46:46,329
Bradley decided to express his

1746
01:46:46,329 --> 01:46:48,329
artistic talent on the living room wall.

1747
01:46:48,329 --> 01:46:50,329
Glitten will cover it in one coat.

1748
01:46:50,329 --> 01:46:52,329
They're so cute at that age.

1749
01:46:52,329 --> 01:46:54,329
You can't get mad at them. What a bet.

1750
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:56,329
Are you sure you have everything?

1751
01:46:56,329 --> 01:46:58,329
Yeah, it's right there.

1752
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,329
Turn around.

1753
01:47:00,329 --> 01:47:02,329
It's right there.

1754
01:47:02,329 --> 01:47:04,329
I didn't forget. Oh.

1755
01:47:04,329 --> 01:47:06,329
You forgot you married the perfect husband.

1756
01:47:06,329 --> 01:47:08,329
You were right, Dad. Kmart's pretty cool.

1757
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:10,329
You should listen to me more often.

1758
01:47:10,329 --> 01:47:12,329
Now, it would be so much

1759
01:47:12,329 --> 01:47:14,329
if another group came by and were like

1760
01:47:14,329 --> 01:47:16,329
Oh, so cereal tonight?

1761
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:18,329
Of course, son.

1762
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:21,270
Yeah, sure.

1763
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,270
Oh, you're filming? Oh, they're filming us.

1764
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:25,270
I feel like that felt

1765
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:31,460
I don't know.

1766
01:47:31,460 --> 01:47:33,460
I just think it's funny.

1767
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,460
Kmart's pretty cool. You should listen to me more often.

1768
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:41,289
Of all pine cleaners,

1769
01:47:41,289 --> 01:47:43,289
more people choose Pinesaw.

1770
01:47:43,289 --> 01:47:45,289
Pinesaw's got more active ingredients

1771
01:47:45,289 --> 01:47:47,289
than the next leading brand. Does that mean it's better though?

1772
01:47:47,289 --> 01:47:49,289
There's more stuff in here.

1773
01:47:49,289 --> 01:47:51,289
It even kills staph germs.

1774
01:47:51,289 --> 01:47:53,289
It's not really clean until

1775
01:47:53,289 --> 01:47:55,289
it's pine solved.

1776
01:47:55,289 --> 01:47:57,289
Friday on Full House, Joey and Jesse

1777
01:47:57,289 --> 01:47:59,289
get close to nature.

1778
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:08,380
If they get sprayed, I'll laugh.

1779
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:10,380
Are they going to get sprayed?

1780
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:12,380
It's time for our boy to become a man.

1781
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:14,380
Your mother sent out 150 invitations

1782
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:16,380
and we got 10 tons of potato salad

1783
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,380
downstairs. Rejoice!

1784
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,380
Robbie comes of age on his howling

1785
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:22,380
day and all new dinosaurs

1786
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:24,380
come to Full House Friday.

1787
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:29,369
...to the Indianapolis 500.

1788
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:31,859
Thrilled of living some of the biggest names in auto racing today.

1789
01:48:31,859 --> 01:48:33,859
Feel the rush of driving at speeds

1790
01:48:33,859 --> 01:48:37,319
of over 200 miles an hour.

1791
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:39,319
Tribulations of top contenders careening toward their

1792
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:41,319
place in racing history. Many attempts,

1793
01:48:41,319 --> 01:48:43,319
only 33 will qualify.

1794
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:45,319
Be there as Channel 7's Dan Lovett gives you

1795
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:47,319
a driver's eye view of the Indy 500

1796
01:48:47,319 --> 01:48:49,319
from the local racers who make it great.

1797
01:48:49,319 --> 01:48:51,319
The Indy 500, the Bay Area Connection

1798
01:48:51,319 --> 01:48:53,319
tonight, tonight, tonight on Channel 7 News at 11.

1799
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,319
My goodness.

1800
01:48:55,319 --> 01:48:57,319
Royal Caribbean's three and four night

1801
01:48:57,319 --> 01:48:59,319
buses from Los Angeles to Mexico.

1802
01:48:59,319 --> 01:49:01,319
The grand resorts that offer so much

1803
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:03,319
for so little. So why wait?

1804
01:49:03,319 --> 01:49:05,319
This session has the same energy as watching TV

1805
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:07,319
with your boomer uncle.

1806
01:49:07,319 --> 01:49:11,800
Welcome. Is this your kid?

1807
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,800
And is he drinking the only juice drink

1808
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,800
with a full day's vitamin C?

1809
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,800
Four other vitamins and all natural flavors?

1810
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:19,800
Well, maybe this isn't your kid.

1811
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,800
But this should be his juice drink.

1812
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,800
Tang Fruit Box Nutrition

1813
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,800
in disguise.

1814
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,800
Don't care about movie stars who live

1815
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:29,800
in Hollywood.

1816
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:34,090
Don't like their attitude. What they could taste

1817
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:36,090
I know I taste good.

1818
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:40,090
The best things always seem misunderstood.

1819
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:42,090
Just give me what the doctor wants.

1820
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:46,890
Dr. Pepper has been

1821
01:49:46,890 --> 01:49:48,890
pretty consistent flavor-wise.

1822
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:51,260
They could have

1823
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:53,260
probably pivoted if they wanted to.

1824
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,750
I would consider Dr.

1825
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:57,750
Pepper's flavor to be extreme.

1826
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:59,930
You can't just say you're the best.

1827
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:01,930
It's kind of extreme. You have to prove it.

1828
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,930
And they probably could have pivoted.

1829
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,930
That's why century 21

1830
01:50:05,930 --> 01:50:07,930
professionals are trained to know

1831
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,930
their business better.

1832
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:11,930
Skilled at making everything work together.

1833
01:50:11,930 --> 01:50:13,930
Committed to giving you the highest

1834
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:15,930
level of professional service.

1835
01:50:15,930 --> 01:50:17,930
The standard of

1836
01:50:17,930 --> 01:50:19,930
performance by which all others will

1837
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:22,810
be judged.

1838
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:24,810
Oh, it's like a...

1839
01:50:24,810 --> 01:50:27,689
I like wearing white, but not under

1840
01:50:27,689 --> 01:50:29,689
my arm. This solid leaves a white

1841
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:31,689
flaky mess. But now, there's

1842
01:50:31,689 --> 01:50:33,689
new arid sports scent. Solid protection

1843
01:50:33,689 --> 01:50:35,689
that never turns white or messy.

1844
01:50:35,689 --> 01:50:37,689
New arid sports scent.

1845
01:50:37,689 --> 01:50:39,689
Solid protection without

1846
01:50:39,689 --> 01:50:41,689
the white mess.

1847
01:50:41,689 --> 01:50:43,689
For fun around here, me and the boys

1848
01:50:43,689 --> 01:50:45,689
liked it.

1849
01:50:45,689 --> 01:50:47,689
It might be time to change compilations.

1850
01:50:47,689 --> 01:50:49,689
We've watched this one for an hour.

1851
01:50:49,689 --> 01:50:51,689
This one had some pretty good ones.

1852
01:50:51,689 --> 01:50:53,689
We'll get a new compilation.

1853
01:50:55,689 --> 01:50:57,689
Let's give it like

1854
01:50:57,689 --> 01:50:59,689
a few more.

1855
01:50:59,689 --> 01:51:01,689
Damn.

1856
01:51:01,689 --> 01:51:04,180
Lost again.

1857
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:15,130
Kiss me once

1858
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:17,130
and kiss me twice

1859
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:19,130
and kiss me once again.

1860
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:21,130
It's been a long

1861
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:24,840
long...

1862
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,840
Unlock the magic.

1863
01:51:26,840 --> 01:51:30,100
Alright. Okay.

1864
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:34,340
A cool new star.

1865
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:36,340
Snickers ice cream bar.

1866
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:38,340
Rich milk

1867
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:40,340
chocolate, buttery caramel,

1868
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:42,340
and fresh roasted peanuts.

1869
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:44,340
Only a few of these came in a box.

1870
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,340
And

1871
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:48,579
my brother used to be so fucking

1872
01:51:48,579 --> 01:51:51,020
angry with me. I would eat

1873
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:53,020
three of them at least. I think only three or four of them

1874
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:55,579
came in a box. And I would

1875
01:51:55,579 --> 01:51:57,579
eat three of them in a row.

1876
01:51:57,579 --> 01:51:59,579
And he would open the box and he would scream

1877
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:01,579
at me. He'd be like

1878
01:52:01,579 --> 01:52:03,579
STOP EATING ALL

1879
01:52:03,579 --> 01:52:05,819
THE SNICKERS ICE CREAM BARS!

1880
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:07,819
And I would just be like, I didn't.

1881
01:52:07,819 --> 01:52:10,180
I didn't. It's like, what are you talking about?

1882
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,180
Like, there's literally four in the box.

1883
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:17,029
We know who's eating them.

1884
01:52:17,029 --> 01:52:19,029
You've told this story before? Oh yeah.

1885
01:52:19,029 --> 01:52:21,029
It would happen every time. And that was a treat.

1886
01:52:21,029 --> 01:52:23,659
If there were Snickers ice cream bars

1887
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:27,239
in that freezer, I would just eat

1888
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:29,239
I would eat them until they were gone.

1889
01:52:29,239 --> 01:52:32,380
And I would only think about

1890
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:35,000
how bad I was being after.

1891
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,119
You know what I mean? I would eat

1892
01:52:38,119 --> 01:52:40,300
two or three in a row.

1893
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:44,260
And I'd be like, that was bad.

1894
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:46,260
And then my brother would just be pissed.

1895
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:50,869
Does he still do this, Holly?

1896
01:52:50,869 --> 01:52:54,439
Um, yeah.

1897
01:52:54,439 --> 01:52:56,439
I don't mean to. I just like

1898
01:52:56,439 --> 01:53:03,739
love food.

1899
01:53:03,739 --> 01:53:06,039
I love orange juice. And

1900
01:53:06,039 --> 01:53:08,039
we'll get orange juice. It's like

1901
01:53:08,039 --> 01:53:10,600
alright, orange juice. Just to make

1902
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:12,600
sure this is completely clear.

1903
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,479
This is only going to be in the fridge

1904
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:17,479
for like maybe two days. It's all

1905
01:53:17,479 --> 01:53:20,100
going to be gone. All of it. I'll drink

1906
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,100
the whole thing in like a few days.

1907
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:24,279
It's bad.

1908
01:53:24,279 --> 01:53:26,279
Orange juice is like one of my favorite things

1909
01:53:26,279 --> 01:53:28,460
in the world. And if it's available

1910
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,529
to me, it will be gone. The apple juice

1911
01:53:31,529 --> 01:53:33,770
incident? Oh, okay.

1912
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:36,949
So...

1913
01:53:36,949 --> 01:53:42,420
So, okay.

1914
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,420
I like kefir.

1915
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:46,420
It's kind of a yogurt. It's like a yogurt

1916
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:49,289
champagne. And

1917
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:51,289
I keep telling her,

1918
01:53:51,289 --> 01:53:53,289
oh, you should really drink kefir. It's got like

1919
01:53:53,289 --> 01:53:55,289
probiotics. It's really kind of good for you.

1920
01:53:55,289 --> 01:53:57,289
She didn't have an opportunity. I drink the whole thing

1921
01:53:57,289 --> 01:54:00,100
before she gets a sip. And I keep saying,

1922
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,100
why don't you drink some more kefir? Why don't you have some kefir? It's good.

1923
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:04,409
And then she'd be like, hey, where's the kefir?

1924
01:54:04,409 --> 01:54:06,710
And I'll go, oh, it's all gone. I drank all of it.

1925
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:17,319
So,

1926
01:54:17,319 --> 01:54:19,939
I just, if there's

1927
01:54:19,939 --> 01:54:21,939
orange juice, kefir,

1928
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,939
or Snickers ice cream bars

1929
01:54:23,939 --> 01:54:26,380
in that fridge,

1930
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:30,220
why is my voice doing that?

1931
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,220
Yeah, I got a special apple juice

1932
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:34,220
specifically because

1933
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,220
it's the, what's the brand?

1934
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:39,289
It's that brand that's super,

1935
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:41,289
everybody loves it. It's super delicious.

1936
01:54:41,289 --> 01:54:43,779
It's an apple juice brand.

1937
01:54:43,779 --> 01:54:46,220
What is it? What is it? What is it? Yes,

1938
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,649
it's Martinelli's. So, Martinelli's

1939
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:50,649
makes this delicious apple juice.

1940
01:54:50,649 --> 01:54:52,649
And I bought one specifically

1941
01:54:52,649 --> 01:54:54,649
for her. It was a surprise.

1942
01:54:54,649 --> 01:54:56,649
I was like, hey, look what I got

1943
01:54:56,649 --> 01:54:58,649
for you. It's Martinelli's

1944
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:00,649
apple juice. We love this stuff.

1945
01:55:00,649 --> 01:55:03,140
But I want to make sure the record is correct.

1946
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:06,090
Yes, so

1947
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:08,090
I bought this for her because

1948
01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:10,390
I wanted to surprise her with lunch.

1949
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:12,390
And I drank it before

1950
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,390
I want to make sure I get the record straight.

1951
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:16,390
I drank it before she could drink it.

1952
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:18,390
Even though I specifically was like a surprise

1953
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:22,939
for her.

1954
01:55:22,939 --> 01:55:24,939
I remember looking at the bottle

1955
01:55:24,939 --> 01:55:27,180
and I was like,

1956
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:29,180
oh, shit, because I drank it.

1957
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:31,180
And I was like, no, no, I have to

1958
01:55:31,180 --> 01:55:33,180
replace this. I have to replace this.

1959
01:55:37,579 --> 01:55:39,579
She found the empty bottle in like the recycling

1960
01:55:39,579 --> 01:55:42,390
or something, right? And I

1961
01:55:42,390 --> 01:55:44,390
was like, I'm so sorry.

1962
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:46,390
It was supposed to be a surprise, but I just was too

1963
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:48,390
delicious. It was truly,

1964
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:52,359
truly a moment. But I replaced it.

1965
01:55:52,359 --> 01:55:54,359
And I make sure now that I get

1966
01:55:54,359 --> 01:56:03,699
double. This is, alright,

1967
01:56:03,699 --> 01:56:05,699
this has only happened like

1968
01:56:05,699 --> 01:56:08,069
twice ever.

1969
01:56:08,069 --> 01:56:12,170
Okay? She said it was so

1970
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:20,489
funny. No, twice

1971
01:56:20,489 --> 01:56:22,489
as in, you don't put Snickers

1972
01:56:22,489 --> 01:56:24,489
ice cream bars in the freezer because

1973
01:56:24,489 --> 01:56:26,489
I'll eat them all. And orange

1974
01:56:26,489 --> 01:56:29,239
juice. You were so

1975
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,239
sad. I really was. I was just like,

1976
01:56:31,239 --> 01:56:33,239
I can't, I gotta be better

1977
01:56:33,239 --> 01:56:35,239
than this. I gotta, you're better than this.

1978
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:45,369
Just the way you like it. So have it

1979
01:56:45,369 --> 01:56:47,369
your way with the coolest

1980
01:56:47,369 --> 01:56:49,369
new star, Snickers

1981
01:56:49,369 --> 01:56:51,369
ice cream bar at Burger King.

1982
01:56:54,699 --> 01:56:59,750
Get one of those bear

1983
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,750
fruit boxes that they put on

1984
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:04,500
camping trip. Yeah. And then

1985
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,500
set, then set a camera up

1986
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,500
at like 3 a.m. pointing

1987
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,260
at the fridge. And you'll just get me coming

1988
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:13,260
down with like a bathrobe on, just like

1989
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,119
and it's like,

1990
01:57:16,119 --> 01:57:18,119
door opening it

1991
01:57:18,119 --> 01:57:20,119
like sleepy,

1992
01:57:22,359 --> 01:57:26,710
And

1993
01:57:26,710 --> 01:57:28,710
it's, don't get it.

1994
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,710
What if I smash it?

1995
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:39,590
You're hungry. That's

1996
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:41,590
the grizzly bear. That's the classic grizzly bear

1997
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:45,560
noise. Beat Otto his carrot

1998
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:48,819
treat. Oh yeah we will.

1999
01:57:48,819 --> 01:57:54,140
Mini fringe fridge with a

2000
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:59,770
combination lock. Yeah

2001
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:01,770
she'll do, she'll do that. And all the sudden

2002
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:06,979
All of a sudden, a day or two later, she will hear, in the other room, this is the lock

2003
01:58:06,979 --> 01:58:12,460
picking lawyer, and here I have a combination lock that is, uh, a little outdated in my

2004
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:16,960
opinion.

2005
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:28,699
I mean, like, how do I get into that thing?

2006
01:58:28,699 --> 01:58:31,869
Taste the cold of Diet 7 Up.

2007
01:58:31,869 --> 01:58:35,430
It's a few degrees away from the everyday.

2008
01:58:35,430 --> 01:58:37,430
Diet 7 Up with NutraSweet.

2009
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:39,430
Break the ice.

2010
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:56,569
That was intense.

2011
01:58:56,569 --> 01:58:59,569
50 years of magic will continue in a moment.

2012
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:04,890
Customs officials harassed for reporting possible corruption in the war on drugs.

2013
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:08,890
ABC News investigation on world news tonight with Peter Jennings tomorrow.

2014
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:18,800
When is Disney's 100 year anniversary?

2015
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:36,260
Literally right now.

2016
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,329
Tomorrow.

2017
01:59:38,329 --> 01:59:39,329
Wait, really?

2018
01:59:39,329 --> 01:59:40,329
It's literally today.

2019
01:59:40,329 --> 01:59:42,329
It's literally right now.

2020
01:59:43,329 --> 01:59:49,470
2037, okay.

2021
01:59:49,470 --> 02:00:11,100
I thought he was carrying a television.

2022
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:16,010
I thought he had a CRTV in his hand.

2023
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:21,939
I was like, why is this guy carrying a fucking TV?

2024
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,140
We already saw this one.

2025
02:00:54,460 --> 02:01:02,140
I want you to close your eyes.

2026
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:06,140
And I want you to imagine this as somebody just sipping coffee.

2027
02:01:06,140 --> 02:01:11,449
This is a nice, smooth coffee that they're drinking with the same lighting.

2028
02:01:11,449 --> 02:01:12,449
Okay?

2029
02:01:12,939 --> 02:01:14,939
Across the USA.

2030
02:01:14,939 --> 02:01:17,939
As long as we've been around.

2031
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:20,939
Our passengers are our neighbors.

2032
02:01:20,939 --> 02:01:23,939
This country's our hometown.

2033
02:01:23,939 --> 02:01:25,939
Oh, the bold flavoring.

2034
02:01:25,939 --> 02:01:47,659
You know how hard blood has flowed.

2035
02:01:47,659 --> 02:01:53,260
And like hitting, you know, ding.

2036
02:01:53,260 --> 02:02:02,149
And they're going, ah.

2037
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:03,149
Serious burger lover.

2038
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:06,149
He's doing a blind taste test of McDonald's new McLean Deluxe Sandwich.

2039
02:02:06,149 --> 02:02:07,149
Oh, wait.

2040
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:08,149
And the taste is going boom.

2041
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:12,470
McDonald's is the only one with this 91% fat free lean beef fat.

2042
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:13,470
Wait, hold up.

2043
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:14,470
91% fat free?

2044
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:15,470
No, man.

2045
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:16,470
Straight up.

2046
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:17,470
The taste is kicking.

2047
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:18,470
And there's a serious volume.

2048
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:19,470
The new McLean Deluxe.

2049
02:02:19,470 --> 02:02:20,470
100% down.

2050
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,470
On taste.

2051
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:22,470
Word up.

2052
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:46,220
If your socks are announcing unexpected new breakthroughs.

2053
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:51,220
That was a weird, that was a weird, what was that explosion?

2054
02:02:51,220 --> 02:02:52,220
New breakthroughs.

2055
02:02:52,220 --> 02:02:55,220
Introduce your feet to ours.

2056
02:02:55,220 --> 02:02:56,220
Burlington socks.

2057
02:02:56,220 --> 02:02:58,220
For quality at a price you love.

2058
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:00,220
Why is it such an explosion?

2059
02:03:00,220 --> 02:03:03,220
The green C means more sock for the money.

2060
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:06,220
They're the first inhabitants of the moon.

2061
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:09,220
If you want some bon-bons, have some yummy bon-bons.

2062
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:12,220
If you like bon-bons, they're so yummy bon-bons.

2063
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:13,220
Not going to leave them out there.

2064
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:14,220
Wait, hold on.

2065
02:03:15,220 --> 02:03:38,470
If your socks are announcing unexpected new breakthroughs.

2066
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:39,470
Like.

2067
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:43,840
It's the first inhabitants of the moon with the dream of a new life.

2068
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:45,840
There's a solar flare heading for them.

2069
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,840
But it becomes a fight for survival.

2070
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,840
My father's out there.

2071
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,840
I'm not going to leave them out there to die.

2072
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:51,840
Incoming flare alert.

2073
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,840
Do you copy?

2074
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:53,840
A world premiere movie.

2075
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,840
Plymouth.

2076
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,840
Sunday.

2077
02:03:55,840 --> 02:04:00,840
Next, John Stossel discovers some of the best kept secrets in child care.

2078
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:01,840

Getting your children to sleep.

2080
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,840
How to raise a happy child.

2081
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,840
Whether you're a parent or not.

2082
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:07,840
It just shows me chugging apple juice.

2083
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,840
Special edition of 2020.

2084
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:10,840
Next.

2085
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,840
And looking into the camera, concerned.

2086
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,840
Once you've tried something like this, you just don't go back.

2087
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,840
After Johnson & Johnson created AccuView disposable contact lenses, there was one thing left to do.

2088
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,260
If they would give away.

2089
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:26,260
So we did.

2090
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:28,260
It's comfortable.

2091
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:29,260
Just put them in.

2092
02:04:29,260 --> 02:04:30,260
Boom, they feel great.

2093
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:31,260
You don't clean them.

2094
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:36,260
Visit your eye care professional for an exam, and if AccuView is right for you, you'll get a free trial pair.

2095
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,260
That's all it took for me.

2096
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:40,260
Just to put them on one time.

2097
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:49,579
See your truth shining through.

2098
02:04:49,579 --> 02:04:52,779
Truth shining through.

2099
02:04:52,779 --> 02:04:57,779
Because the world gets more colorful every day, Kodak introduces a more colorful film.

2100
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:00,779
New Kodak Gold 400 film.

2101
02:05:00,779 --> 02:05:05,779
It now has the richest, most saturated color available in high speed film.

2102
02:05:05,779 --> 02:05:08,779
New Kodak Gold 400 film.

2103
02:05:12,409 --> 02:05:15,579
Isn't it worth this to get a bag that can take this?

2104
02:05:15,579 --> 02:05:18,579
Isn't it worth this for a bag that can take this?

2105
02:05:18,579 --> 02:05:20,579
Announcing the new Hefty Steel Sack.

2106
02:05:20,579 --> 02:05:23,579

2107
02:05:23,579 --> 02:05:25,579
And only two cents more per bag than the average.

02:05:25,579 --> 02:05:26,579

2109
02:05:26,579 --> 02:05:27,579
Two cents more?

Go wild.

2111
02:05:28,579 --> 02:05:29,579
Go crazy.

2112
02:05:29,579 --> 02:05:30,579
Go Disney.

2113
02:05:30,579 --> 02:05:31,579
Go wild.

2114
02:05:31,579 --> 02:05:32,579
Go wild.

2115
02:05:32,579 --> 02:05:33,579
Go for the Jungle Book.

2116
02:05:33,579 --> 02:05:34,579
I'm very much money.

2117
02:05:34,579 --> 02:05:35,579
That's not very much money.

2118
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:39,579
Buy it today and get five dollars back with our Nabisco rebate offer.

2119
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:40,579
The Jungle Book.

2120
02:05:40,579 --> 02:05:45,579
What was that Cheers collection that was like ten grand to get the whole thing over like

2121
02:05:45,579 --> 02:05:46,579
forty years?

2122
02:05:46,579 --> 02:05:47,579
Yeah, I know.

2123
02:05:47,579 --> 02:05:48,579
What?

2124
02:05:48,579 --> 02:05:49,579
It was cheaper.

2125
02:05:49,579 --> 02:05:50,579
I saved a few cents.

2126
02:05:50,579 --> 02:05:51,579
Mom.

2127
02:05:51,579 --> 02:05:52,579
It's not the cheesiest.

2128
02:05:52,579 --> 02:05:53,579
What's the difference?

2129
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:54,579
No.

2130
02:05:54,579 --> 02:05:56,340
No.

2131
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:57,340
Sam.

2132
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:58,340
Come on pal.

2133
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:59,340
Dinner.

2134
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:02,340
Mom, you never serve anything but Kraft cheese and macaroni.

2135
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:03,340
Right?

2136
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:04,340
I wouldn't dream of it.

2137
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:05,340
Oh.

2138
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:07,340
That's not for dinner tonight.

2139
02:06:07,340 --> 02:06:08,340
It's broccoli.

2140
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,340
Kraft macaroni and cheese.

2141
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,340
And asparagus.

2142
02:06:10,340 --> 02:06:11,340
You're going to hate L.A.

2143
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,340
I will?

2144
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,699
Melissa's got a job on a sitcom.

2145
02:06:13,699 --> 02:06:14,699
Do you have a real feel for the show?

2146
02:06:14,699 --> 02:06:15,699
Loves the star.

2147
02:06:15,699 --> 02:06:16,699
It's a pressure cooker.

2148
02:06:16,699 --> 02:06:17,699
It really is.

2149
02:06:17,699 --> 02:06:18,699
Loves the writer.

2150
02:06:18,699 --> 02:06:19,699
There's something about you.

2151
02:06:19,699 --> 02:06:20,699
Hates the business.

2152
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:21,699
Who do you want us to contact?

2153
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:22,699
Excuse me?

2154
02:06:22,699 --> 02:06:23,699
Who represents you?

2155
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:24,699
I do.

2156
02:06:24,699 --> 02:06:25,699
Thirty-something.

2157
02:06:25,699 --> 02:06:26,699
Tuesday.

2158
02:06:26,699 --> 02:06:27,699
All across America.

2159
02:06:28,699 --> 02:06:30,699
One out of two homes is a Kenmore home.

2160
02:06:30,699 --> 02:06:31,699
Here's can be two.

2161
02:06:31,699 --> 02:06:35,260
With our large capacity washer and matching Kenmore dryer.

2162
02:06:35,260 --> 02:06:36,260
Just $399.87.

2163
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:37,260
$309.87.

2164
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:38,260
Exclusively at Sears and Sears brand central.

2165
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:41,260
I'm trying to think of like a washer and dryer combo now.

2166
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:42,260
It's hot.

2167
02:06:42,260 --> 02:06:43,260
And it's only linked to Pizza Hut.

2168
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:46,260
That'll get one new Sausage Lovers pizza for $8.99.

2169
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:49,949
Or a second for just four hours more.

2170
02:06:49,949 --> 02:06:52,949
Yeah, that's like at least $8.99.

2171
02:06:52,949 --> 02:06:53,949
It's hot.

2172
02:06:53,949 --> 02:06:56,949
And it's only linked to Pizza Hut.

2173
02:06:56,949 --> 02:06:57,949
Or a second for just four hours more.

2174
02:06:57,949 --> 02:07:00,949
Yeah, that's like at least $500, $600, $700 now at least.

2175
02:07:00,949 --> 02:07:01,949
It's a deal you can sink your teeth into.

2176
02:07:01,949 --> 02:07:02,949
A thousand bucks now?

2177
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:03,949
Yeah.

2178
02:07:03,949 --> 02:07:09,380
You're not leaving until you eat breakfast so you might as well do it.

2179
02:07:09,380 --> 02:07:12,380
If we've told you once, we've told you a thousand times.

2180
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:15,380
Have you forgotten everything we taught you?

2181
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:20,380
A suggestion for all you grown-ups who think there's no time for a hot breakfast.

2182
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:21,380
Kellogg's Pop-Tarts.

2183
02:07:21,380 --> 02:07:23,380
Zero fruit.

2184
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:25,380
You like fruit, don't you?

2185
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:28,380
And open wide.

2186
02:07:28,380 --> 02:07:29,380
Kellogg's Pop-Tarts.

2187
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:31,380
The hot breakfast everyone has time for.

2188
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,380
You know you like them.

2189
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:36,380
Is this back before there was frosting all over?

2190
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:37,380
I'm Kate Kelly in New Orleans.

2191
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:38,380
Coming up tonight on Nightcast.

2192
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:39,380
The power of voodoo.

2193
02:07:39,380 --> 02:07:40,380
There was no frosting on there.

2194
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:43,380
Could it determine the outcome of Sunday Super Bowl?

2195
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:46,859
What is going on?

2196
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:47,859
What was that?

2197
02:07:47,859 --> 02:07:48,859
And are the 49ers superstitious?

2198
02:07:48,859 --> 02:07:49,859
What was the audio?

2199
02:07:49,859 --> 02:07:50,859
What was that?

2200
02:07:50,859 --> 02:07:53,859
I went through before the game to try to get myself as nervous as possible.

2201
02:07:53,859 --> 02:07:58,859
I'm just going to stay out of the small towns and stay away from the people working the voodoo.

2202
02:07:58,859 --> 02:07:59,859
Voodoo at the Super Bowl.

2203
02:07:59,859 --> 02:08:00,859
What?

2204
02:08:00,859 --> 02:08:02,859
Live coverage from New Orleans continues tonight on Nightcast.

2205
02:08:02,859 --> 02:08:03,859
Wait, what?

2206
02:08:03,859 --> 02:08:09,090
I'm so confused.

2207
02:08:09,090 --> 02:08:15,090
We've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S. ski team get to their events early.

2208
02:08:15,090 --> 02:08:21,090
Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.

2209
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:23,090
The Norwegians beat us.

2210
02:08:23,090 --> 02:08:24,090
The French beat us.

2211
02:08:24,090 --> 02:08:27,090
As did the Italians and the Swedes.

2212
02:08:27,090 --> 02:08:29,090
How'd they do it?

2213
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:31,090
Dude, everybody in this car is screaming.

2214
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:32,090
Do you understand?

2215
02:08:32,090 --> 02:08:34,090
This is not like a fun trip.

2216
02:08:34,090 --> 02:08:36,090
If this is me in this car, I am screaming.

2217
02:08:36,090 --> 02:08:39,090
At the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.

2218
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:40,090
Where's the road?

2219
02:08:40,090 --> 02:08:41,090
There's no road.

2220
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:42,090
We don't know where we are.

2221
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:43,090
This is, I'm screaming.

2222
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:44,090
The Norwegians beat us.

2223
02:08:44,090 --> 02:08:45,090
The French beat us.

2224
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:47,090
As did the Italians and the Swedes.

2225
02:08:47,090 --> 02:08:51,060
How'd they do it?

2226
02:08:51,060 --> 02:08:54,130
The U.S. team was not the first to arrive.

2227
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:55,560
It wasn't road.

2228
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,560
I don't know.

2229
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:57,560
I don't know.

2230
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:58,560
That was kind of scary.

2231
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:03,560
Imagine a Disneyland as big as the city of San Francisco.

2232
02:09:03,560 --> 02:09:06,560
A Disney World with a surprise around every corner.

2233
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:10,560
43 square miles of tropical paradise.

2234
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,560
The spectacular new Disney MGM Studios theme park.

2235
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:18,560
And the incredible Epcot Center.

2236
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,989
Imagine yourself here.

2237
02:09:20,989 --> 02:09:23,989
Walt Disney World in Florida.

2238
02:09:23,989 --> 02:09:25,989
As big as imagination gets.

2239
02:09:25,989 --> 02:09:26,989
Holy shit, Mickey.

2240
02:09:26,989 --> 02:09:29,989
Be careful up there, dude.

2241
02:09:29,989 --> 02:09:31,989
That was...

2242
02:09:31,989 --> 02:09:32,989
Whoa.

2243
02:09:32,989 --> 02:09:36,680
You never know where history will unfold.

2244
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:37,680
But you always know where to turn.

2245
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:38,680
Epcot?

2246
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:39,680
I actually...

2247
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,680
Epcot is...

2248
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:41,680
That's cool.

2249
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:43,680
But it's CBS News.

2250
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,680
Gary's being pushed too far.

2251
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:47,680
If you love me, you must leave me alone.

2252
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,680
His worst nightmare is taking shape.

2253
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:52,680
My children are gonna be living under the same roof as a rapist.

2254
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:54,680
His last resort, an act of desperation.

2255
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,680
Speak now, or else forever hold your peace.

2256
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:00,680
I'm gonna yell, rapist, rapist.

2257
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:03,680
On Nuts Landing, Thursday.

2258
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:06,180
This is CBS.

2259
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:11,250
It's the biggest party in the history of Disneyland.

2260
02:10:11,250 --> 02:10:15,500
It's Disney!

2261
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,500
Birthday separation.

2262
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:17,500
What the fuck?

2263
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:18,500
The biggest parade we've ever staged.

2264
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:21,500
Towering four stories over Main Street.

2265
02:10:21,500 --> 02:10:23,500
Our biggest giveaway ever.

2266
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:25,500
A new GEO every day.

2267
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,500
And over 400,000 other prizes.

2268
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:29,500
What is going on?

2269
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,500
What is going on right now?

2270
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,500
This is a huge party.

2271
02:10:37,699 --> 02:10:38,699
Wait.

2272
02:10:38,699 --> 02:10:47,890
I thought they were celebrating 50.

2273
02:10:47,890 --> 02:10:49,890
35th anniversary.

2274
02:10:55,439 --> 02:10:58,439
Instead of sitting there, you could be sitting here.

2275
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:01,439
In a Mazda MX-6 GT.

2276
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:05,439
Get one now and you'll also get $750 cash back.

2277
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:07,439
It's a better value than Toyota Celica.

2278
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:09,439
The features Celica doesn't have.

2279
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:11,439
And a price that's already less.

2280
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:14,439
So for your MX-6, an additional $750 cash.

2281
02:11:14,439 --> 02:11:17,439
This looks kind of nice though, doesn't it?

2282
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:19,439
This seems actually kind of better.

2283
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:23,939
Instead of sitting there, you could be sitting...

2284
02:11:23,939 --> 02:11:27,180
What an unbelievably wonderful afternoon.

2285
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:29,180
Oh, I can sit here with my cat.

2286
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:32,180
And enjoy the sun.

2287
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:37,479
Rather than going really fast around tight turns in a car.

2288
02:11:37,479 --> 02:11:39,479
In a Mazda MX-6 GT.

2289
02:11:39,479 --> 02:11:43,479
Get one now and you'll also get $750 cash back.

2290
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:45,479
It's a better value than Toyota Celica.

2291
02:11:45,479 --> 02:11:46,479
The features Celica doesn't have.

2292
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:48,479
And a price that's already less.

2293
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,479
So for your MX-6 and an additional $750 cash back.

2294
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:54,479
You know where it's at.

2295
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:58,979
At your Northern California Mazda dealer now.

2296
02:11:59,979 --> 02:12:06,220
There are very few guarantees in medicine.

2297
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:09,220
But if you have arthritis pain like I do,

2298
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:12,220
you should know about Mediprin and the Mediprin Guarantee.

2299
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:14,220
If two Mediprin don't relieve...

2300
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:16,220
Oh yes, you can open your eyes now.

2301
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:18,220
...better than two regular aspirin, you get your money back.

2302
02:12:18,220 --> 02:12:20,220
Strong promise? Strong medicine.

2303
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:25,220
The medicine that concentrates the power of ibuprofen into these potent little caplets.

2304
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:28,220
The medicine that guarantees better relief than regular aspirin.

2305
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,220
Better arthritis pain relief.

2306
02:12:30,220 --> 02:12:32,220
That's the Mediprin Guarantee.

2307
02:12:32,220 --> 02:12:34,220
They know they want to win.

2308
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:36,220
You know, there's a certain medicine.

2309
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:44,220
It's actually kind of remarkable just how well stuff like Tylenol, acetaminophen, ibuprofen...

2310
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:46,590
It's crazy that you can just take this thing.

2311
02:12:46,590 --> 02:12:48,590
And it's very, very safe.

2312
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:49,829
Right?

2313
02:12:49,829 --> 02:12:50,829
Like if you...

2314
02:12:50,829 --> 02:12:54,069
Obviously if you take this as directed.

2315
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:59,949
We came up with a way to make it so you just tell your brain that this doesn't hurt anymore.

2316
02:12:59,949 --> 02:13:04,659
That's kind of unbelievable.

2317
02:13:04,659 --> 02:13:07,800
Oh no, no, yeah. Just take this.

2318
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:09,800
You've got like a really bad headache.

2319
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:13,039
Oh, just take this thing and it'll be better.

2320
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:14,220
Soon.

2321
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:16,220
That's kind of remarkable.

2322
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:20,720
Ibuprofen Andy.

2323
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:29,260
What?

2324
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:32,779
Ibuprofen Andy?

2325
02:13:32,779 --> 02:13:33,779
Alright.

2326
02:13:33,779 --> 02:13:34,779
...begins with what you feed it.

2327
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:37,779
I mix the pedigree with the pedigree mealtime because the dogs enjoy it.

2328
02:13:37,779 --> 02:13:38,779
It's the perfect combination.

2329
02:13:38,779 --> 02:13:40,779
These are champions. They deserve the best.

2330
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:41,779
Pedigree.

2331
02:13:41,779 --> 02:13:43,779
Recommended by top breeders.

2332
02:13:43,779 --> 02:13:50,779
Right now, you're just 90 seconds away from Chef Boyardee with Microwave Meals.

2333
02:13:50,779 --> 02:13:52,779
Chef Boyardee pasta, hot and tasty.

2334
02:13:52,779 --> 02:13:54,779
And with no messy cleanup.

2335
02:13:54,779 --> 02:13:56,779
Chef Boyardee Microwave Meals.

2336
02:13:56,779 --> 02:13:57,779
You look like enough.

2337
02:13:57,779 --> 02:13:59,779
Thank goodness. In just 90 seconds.

2338
02:13:59,779 --> 02:14:01,779
This morning, I was following this year's service...

2339
02:14:01,779 --> 02:14:02,779
I could probably eat four or five of those.

2340
02:14:02,779 --> 02:14:03,779
...and it dawned on me.

2341
02:14:03,779 --> 02:14:04,779
I think so.

2342
02:14:04,779 --> 02:14:05,779
...Messy Sears trucks all the time.

2343
02:14:05,779 --> 02:14:10,779
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called super stores.

2344
02:14:10,779 --> 02:14:16,779
So before you make that next big buying decision, ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now.

2345
02:14:16,779 --> 02:14:18,779
Or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

2346
02:14:18,779 --> 02:14:24,779
That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.

2347
02:14:24,779 --> 02:14:26,779
And that's what they mean by your money's worth...

2348
02:14:26,779 --> 02:14:27,779
We have the same hair?

2349
02:14:27,779 --> 02:14:28,779
...of a whole lot more.

2350
02:14:28,779 --> 02:14:33,750
No, we don't. Not even close.

2351
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:37,340
It's not even close.

2352
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:41,579
Not even close.

2353
02:14:41,579 --> 02:14:45,420
This looks like something my mom would eat.

2354
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:49,420
It's kind of quiet, conservative.

2355
02:14:49,420 --> 02:14:52,109
I don't think I can get into this.

2356
02:14:52,109 --> 02:14:54,109
I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.

2357
02:14:54,109 --> 02:14:57,300
Hmm. Doesn't taste the way it looks.

2358
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:58,300
Doubter.

2359
02:14:58,300 --> 02:15:00,300
I like the way it crunches.

2360
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:02,729
Maybe it's good because it's simple.

2361
02:15:02,729 --> 02:15:06,100
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. I'm just like my mother.

2362
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:08,100
Kellogg's cornflakes.

2363
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,100
Why would you do that when you can follow your nose...

2364
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:12,100
...to the delicious sugary Fruit Loot?

2365
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:21,100
I hope you'll be with us tonight. Dan Miller will be live from New Orleans Decisive Super Bowl, bringing you updates on goodness knows what, along with actress Karen Black and much more. See you later tonight.

2366
02:15:29,590 --> 02:15:33,590
...a special edition of 48 Hours Thursday.

2367
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:38,279
Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th Anniversary Celebration.

2368
02:15:38,279 --> 02:15:40,279
Brought to you by...

2369
02:15:40,279 --> 02:15:42,279
Dr. Pepper and your local Dr. Pepper Company.

2370
02:15:42,279 --> 02:15:45,279
Dr. Pepper is just what the doctor ordered.

2371
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:49,279
The good-time, great taste of McDonald's.

2372
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:53,279
AT&T. The right choice.

2373
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:54,840
And...

2374
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:58,840
The Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Motors Black Dealers Association.

2375
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,840
Bump the start button.

2376
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,840
What do you like about your Eagle Premier?

2377
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,840
Everything.

2378
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:06,840
You mean the leather interior and the roominess?

2379
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,840
I said everything.

2380
02:16:07,840 --> 02:16:10,840
So what's Premier got that other cars in his class don't have?

2381
02:16:10,840 --> 02:16:11,840
Turbo Teen.

2382
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,840
Me.

2383
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,840
I will never see a standard red car the same ever again.

2384
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:17,840
You got it.

2385
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:18,840
The Taurus and the Cressida?

2386
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:19,840
You got it.

2387
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:20,840
Then you tried the Eagle Premier?

2388
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:21,840
You got it.

2389
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:22,840
What'd you think?

2390
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:25,840
I got it.

2391
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:37,129
Business back.

2392
02:16:37,129 --> 02:16:40,129
Now AT&T can set you free.

2393
02:16:40,129 --> 02:16:43,129
With the first cordless phone specifically designed for business.

2394
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:45,299
The Multi-Line Merlin Cordless.

2395
02:16:45,299 --> 02:16:48,299
This guy's on fucking rugs.

2396
02:16:48,299 --> 02:16:52,299
So you don't have to lose any quality to gain your freedom.

2397
02:16:52,299 --> 02:16:54,299
Set your business free.

2398
02:16:54,299 --> 02:16:57,299
Call 1-800-MERLIN-AT&T.

2399
02:16:57,299 --> 02:17:02,299
I don't think it's fair to give only one of your workers the Super Mario Mushroom.

2400
02:17:02,299 --> 02:17:03,299
You understand?

2401
02:17:03,299 --> 02:17:33,219
Oh, it was Dr. Pepper.

2402
02:17:33,219 --> 02:17:35,219
This is who bad strolls.

2403
02:17:35,219 --> 02:17:38,219
Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.

2404
02:17:38,219 --> 02:17:41,219
He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.

2405
02:17:41,219 --> 02:17:45,219
He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.

2406
02:17:45,219 --> 02:17:49,219
He's not afraid of anything except going slow.

2407
02:17:49,219 --> 02:17:51,219
But if you think he's tough...

2408
02:17:51,219 --> 02:17:53,219
Yeah, he is afraid, isn't he?

2409
02:17:53,219 --> 02:17:54,219
Isn't that scary?

2410
02:17:54,219 --> 02:17:55,219
Wait, hold on.

2411
02:17:55,219 --> 02:17:56,219
Isn't that like scary?

2412
02:17:56,219 --> 02:17:58,219
It's like he's not afraid.

2413
02:17:58,219 --> 02:18:00,219
This is who bad strolls.

2414
02:18:00,219 --> 02:18:03,850
Austrian racer and Olympic gold medalist.

2415
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:07,600
He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.

2416
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:09,100
No, no, no.

2417
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:10,100
That was a battle cry.

2418
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:11,100
That was a war.

2419
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,100
Okay.

2420
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:13,100
I'm just...

2421
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,100
Yeah.

2422
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:15,100
All right.

2423
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:16,100
We're good.

2424
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,100
Except going slow.

2425
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:19,100
But if you think he's tough, wait until you see the guys at the ticket window at the Olympics

2426
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:26,100
if you don't have your Visa card because the Olympics don't take American Express.

2427
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:28,100
It's everywhere you want to be.

2428
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:30,100
Yeah, that was a battle cry.

2429
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:31,100
Really?

2430
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:33,100
You will laugh all night long.

2431
02:18:33,100 --> 02:18:35,100
It was your kind of thing.

2432
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:38,100
You made me laugh.

2433
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,100
It was so embarrassing.

2434
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:41,100
I haven't seen him in years.

2435
02:18:41,100 --> 02:18:42,100
It was great.

2436
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:43,100
He still cracks me up.

2437
02:18:43,100 --> 02:18:45,100
I'll tell you one more time because I think I like that.

2438
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,100
I just did that.

2439
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,100
We just did that.

2440
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:48,100
Yeah.

2441
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:53,100
No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T long distance.

2442
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:55,100
I wish I could have been here too.

2443
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:56,100
Who's that calling?

2444
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,100
Who's this on the phone?

2445
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,100
To reach out.

2446
02:18:58,100 --> 02:18:59,100
All right.

2447
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:00,100
That was cute.

2448
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,100
That was nice.

2449
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,100
I guess.

2450
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:03,100
I don't know.

2451
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:07,100
But when you've got the style of Hanes socks, who wants to run around and...

2452
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:08,100
Boo!

2453
02:19:08,100 --> 02:19:14,620
I hope he blows the socks.

2454
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:15,620
Like to try total?

2455
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:16,620
Mom says grape nuts.

2456
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:17,620
Hope you're hungry.

2457
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:21,620
He takes four bowls of grape nuts to get the vitamins in one bowl of total.

2458
02:19:21,620 --> 02:19:24,620
Total has 100% of a day's supply of 12 vitamins and minerals.

2459
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:25,620
What the fuck?

2460
02:19:25,620 --> 02:19:26,620
You tell her.

2461
02:19:26,620 --> 02:19:30,180
Total, one bowl, 100%.

2462
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:36,639
So total hates grape nuts.

2463
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:38,639
Total is then the enemy of...

2464
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:39,639
What was the other one?

2465
02:19:39,639 --> 02:19:42,219
They all hate each other.

2466
02:19:42,219 --> 02:19:44,219
They're all in the circle of just hating each other.

2467
02:19:44,219 --> 02:19:47,680
What was the first one?

2468
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:52,030
They don't talk shit to each other.

2469
02:19:52,030 --> 02:19:55,270
Okay, so Jess Wright hates total.

2470
02:19:55,270 --> 02:19:56,270
Total hates grape nuts.

2471
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:57,270
Who does grape nuts hate?

2472
02:19:57,270 --> 02:20:00,270
Are we going to get a grape nuts versus like frosted flakes?

2473
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:05,420
And are there any, you know...

2474
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:08,420
I'm addressing you now, the person that talked shit.

2475
02:20:08,420 --> 02:20:10,680
They all hate each other.

2476
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:14,430
Red Lobster announces great new trios.

2477
02:20:14,430 --> 02:20:16,430
Six delicious trios you're going to love.

2478
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:17,430
Terrific.

2479
02:20:17,430 --> 02:20:21,440
Like our large lobster alfredo and scallops.

2480
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:22,440
Love it.

2481
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:25,440
Or our crab legs, juicy scallops, and shrimp.

2482
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:26,440
Let's go.

2483
02:20:26,440 --> 02:20:27,440
But hurry.

2484
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,440
Let's go.

2485
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:29,440
Let's go.

2486
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:36,440
Try the trio with the unbeatable price.

2487
02:20:36,440 --> 02:20:38,440
Oh, 6.99.

2488
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:39,440
6.99.

2489
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:40,440
That's incredible.

2490
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:41,440
That's incredible.

2491
02:20:41,440 --> 02:20:44,440
On one life to live, the start of a love affair.

2492
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,440
This is going to be a good trip.

2493
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:47,440
Or the beginning of the end.

2494
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,440
Oh.

2495
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:50,440
It's an attraction that could be fatal.

2496
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,440
You'll be perfectly safe in the boat.

2497
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:53,440
Trust me.

2498
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:56,440
You'll never forget the incident at Loom Lake on one life to live.

2499
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:57,440
What?

2500
02:20:57,440 --> 02:20:58,440
Ford trucks.

2501
02:20:58,440 --> 02:21:02,440
A lot of what going on.

2502
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:05,680
The first vehicle Henry Ford sold was not a car.

2503
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:06,680
It was a truck.

2504
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:09,680
Our full size pickups were first with rear anti-lock brakes.

2505
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,680
First with electronic overdrive transmission.

2506
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,680
First with push button four wheel drive.

2507
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:15,680
Now what does all this get you?

2508
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:17,680
It gets you number one.

2509
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:20,680
And if you keep doing it, you stay number one.

2510
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:26,299
More people are driving the best built, best selling American trucks than ever before.

2511
02:21:28,299 --> 02:21:29,299
One.

2512
02:21:29,299 --> 02:21:31,299
One just ain't no fun.

2513
02:21:31,299 --> 02:21:33,299
A trip is better than a one.

2514
02:21:33,299 --> 02:21:34,299
Sex.

2515
02:21:34,299 --> 02:21:35,299
Sex.

2516
02:21:35,299 --> 02:21:37,299
It's two bits in one.

2517
02:21:37,299 --> 02:21:39,299
Freshens breath and tastes great.

2518
02:21:39,299 --> 02:21:40,299
Oh, I remember these things.

2519
02:21:40,299 --> 02:21:41,299
I actually remember these things.

2520
02:21:41,299 --> 02:21:44,299
These things were so intense.

2521
02:21:44,299 --> 02:21:47,299
They were kind of grainy and they were super powerful.

2522
02:21:47,299 --> 02:21:48,299
I remember those things.

2523
02:21:48,299 --> 02:21:49,299
Those things are crazy.

2524
02:21:49,299 --> 02:21:53,610
New Caledrill Clear not only works better to stop the itch, it dries this clear.

2525
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:56,100
So nobody will ever spot you.

2526
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,100
New Caledrill Clear.

2527
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:00,100
One man unwilling to forgive.

2528
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:02,100
You break the law, don't come running back to me.

2529
02:22:02,100 --> 02:22:04,100
The other unable to forget.

2530
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:06,100
I swore an oath to my country.

2531
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:08,100
Not to what was going on over there.

2532
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:09,100
Charlton Heston.

2533
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:10,100
Peter Strauss.

2534
02:22:10,100 --> 02:22:11,100
Proud Men.

2535
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,100
Saturday.

2536
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:18,479
I said I was going to do a different one after this.

2537
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:20,479
I mean, we're almost at, we're literally at the end.

2538
02:22:20,479 --> 02:22:22,479
We've got to, we've got to.

2539
02:22:22,479 --> 02:22:24,479
Can life come from lava tomorrow on Good Morning America?

2540
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:27,479
How a lava field blossoms into one of nature's miracles.

2541
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:31,479
Then meet B.I. Warshawski. Kathleen Turner turns private eye in her new role.

2542
02:22:31,479 --> 02:22:34,479
Plus Irma Baum back here on Good Morning America tomorrow.

2543
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:36,479
Lava.

2544
02:22:36,479 --> 02:22:40,680
You know, the Channel 7 newsroom is not unlike the community.

2545
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:43,680
Was Richard Lewis in this much of the spotlight back in the late 80s?

2546
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:44,680
Oh yeah.

2547
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:45,680
Everyone comes from different backgrounds.

2548
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:46,680
Richard Lewis was a superstar.

2549
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:48,680
He was everywhere.

2550
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:52,680
Everyone has their own ideas in the newsroom about how they think the day should go.

2551
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:56,680
We tend to have loud laughs and loud debates.

2552
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:59,680
I think the newsroom is a microcosm of the community.

2553
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:01,680
We're really a cross section of the Bay Area.

2554
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:14,819
In a form of life, Sandy can be seen walking in the park,

2555
02:23:14,819 --> 02:23:17,819
wearing sterile pants and stretched denim.

2556
02:23:17,819 --> 02:23:21,309
A deep purple waterproof parka,

2557
02:23:21,309 --> 02:23:23,309
with an arctic fleece liner.

2558
02:23:23,309 --> 02:23:31,180
A-line.

2559
02:23:31,180 --> 02:23:33,360
And climb.

2560
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:35,940
Climb what?

2561
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:39,120
The dog in a past life war.

2562
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,120
The woman who lives on Mission Hill is talking to her brother Peter.

2563
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:44,120
What was that?

2564
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:49,120
Remarkably, this call costs 25% less than last month.

2565
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,120
Because Peter is in Jody's bonus zone.

2566
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:54,120
And Jody just got call bonus from Pacific Bay.

2567
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,120
Bonus zone?

2568
02:23:56,120 --> 02:23:58,120
Wherever you live in California, call us.

2569
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:02,120
We'll check and see if call bonus can save you money too.

2570
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:04,120
Call 1-800-PACK-BELL.

2571
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:05,120
We're making things easier.

2572
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:08,120
So it was less money if you called somebody close to your house.

2573
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:10,120
Another wimpy sandwich.

2574
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:11,120
Not me.

2575
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:13,120
I've got vintage farm's deli loaf.

2576
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:15,120
It's got real sliced meat chunks.

2577
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,120
Still going.

2578
02:24:16,120 --> 02:24:19,120
Nothing outlasts the energizer.

2579
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,120
They keep going and going and go.

2580
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:36,690
A better way to catch your Zs...

2581
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:38,690
I like this one.

2582
02:24:38,690 --> 02:24:40,690
This is a good one. I like this one a lot.

2583
02:24:40,690 --> 02:24:42,690
...designed to conform to your shape.

2584
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:44,690
Distribute your weight evenly.

2585
02:24:44,690 --> 02:24:46,690
Feels like this a lot sometimes.

2586
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:48,690
Really posthopedic, has it?

2587
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:52,690
So for a better night's sleep, better sleep on a ceiling.

2588
02:24:52,690 --> 02:24:53,690
That's a good one.

2589
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:55,690
Someone finally made oatmeal the way I like it.

2590
02:24:55,690 --> 02:24:57,690
He doesn't like oatmeal.

2591
02:24:57,690 --> 02:25:00,690
Oatmeal crisp is big, crispy flakes with oatmeal.

2592
02:25:00,690 --> 02:25:02,690
And it's not grapefruit.

2593
02:25:02,690 --> 02:25:03,690
Lots of crunchy almonds.

2594
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:04,690
That shit's gross.

2595
02:25:04,690 --> 02:25:05,690
Don't you lie to your mother.

2596
02:25:05,690 --> 02:25:07,690
Look, ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

2597
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,690
Look, ma!

2598
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:12,850
Crisp oatmeal raisin crisp.

2599
02:25:12,850 --> 02:25:14,850
Look, ma, I found something for nothing.

2600
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:15,850
Pop secret popcorn.

2601
02:25:15,850 --> 02:25:17,850
Free and specially marked boxes of oatmeal crisp

2602
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:18,850
and oatmeal raisin crisp.

2603
02:25:18,850 --> 02:25:21,850
Be sure and write them a nice thank you note.

2604
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:26,790
Oatmeal flakes with oatmeal.

2605
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:28,790
Where is mom?

2606
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:32,420
Someone finally made oatmeal the way I like it.

2607
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,420
He doesn't like oatmeal.

2608
02:25:34,420 --> 02:25:35,590
Where is she?

2609
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:40,790
And why is it so scary and dark and terrifying where she is?

2610
02:25:40,790 --> 02:25:42,790
Why is mom a detective?

2611
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:45,790
Oatmeal crisp is big, crispy flakes with oatmeal.

2612
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:48,790
Little brown sugar, lots of crunchy almonds.

2613
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:50,790
Don't you lie to your mother.

2614
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:52,790
Look, ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

2615
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:54,790
It kind of sounded like Pee Wee Herman.

2616
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:58,889
I'm imagining like a ha!

2617
02:25:58,889 --> 02:25:59,889
Like right after that.

2618
02:25:59,889 --> 02:26:00,889
Crunchy almonds.

2619
02:26:00,889 --> 02:26:04,790
Don't you lie to your mother.

2620
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:06,790
Look, ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

2621
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:07,790
Look, ma!

2622
02:26:07,790 --> 02:26:12,340
Crisp oatmeal raisin crisp.

2623
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:14,340
Look, ma, I found something for nothing.

2624
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:15,340
Pop secret popcorn.

2625
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:17,340
Free and specially marked boxes of oatmeal crisp

2626
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:18,340
and oatmeal raisin crisp.

2627
02:26:18,340 --> 02:26:19,340
They all keep going.

2628
02:26:19,340 --> 02:26:21,340
Be sure and write them a nice thank you note.

2629
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:27,659
Now there's a new reason to put down those fizzy diet colas.

2630
02:26:27,659 --> 02:26:30,659
It's crystal light in a new shade.

2631
02:26:30,659 --> 02:26:32,659
Pink grapefruit.

2632
02:26:32,659 --> 02:26:33,659
Crystal light.

2633
02:26:33,659 --> 02:26:36,659
Light and luscious with no carbonation.

2634
02:26:38,659 --> 02:26:39,969
Okay, sit down.

2635
02:26:39,969 --> 02:26:41,969
Bring side seats.

2636
02:26:41,969 --> 02:26:43,969
250 bucks.

2637
02:26:43,969 --> 02:26:45,969
This is gonna be great.

2638
02:26:47,530 --> 02:26:49,530
These days a good value is hard to come by.

2639
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:51,530
Unless you come by KFC for the amazing

2640
02:26:51,530 --> 02:26:53,530
double bucket deal.

2641
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:55,530
That was a good one.

2642
02:26:55,530 --> 02:26:57,530
That was a good one.

2643
02:26:57,530 --> 02:26:59,530
And the second's just four bucks.

2644
02:26:59,530 --> 02:27:01,530
Repeat, four bucks.

2645
02:27:01,530 --> 02:27:03,530
The double bucket deal.

2646
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:05,530
Only from KFC.

2647
02:27:09,389 --> 02:27:11,389
That's sad.

2648
02:27:11,389 --> 02:27:13,389
He was Rock's first and only king.

2649
02:27:13,389 --> 02:27:17,389
He had the fame, the cash, the women.

2650
02:27:17,389 --> 02:27:20,629
And he had the pills, the pain.

2651
02:27:20,629 --> 02:27:22,629
One woman saw it all.

2652
02:27:22,629 --> 02:27:24,629
Lived it all.

2653
02:27:24,629 --> 02:27:26,629
This is her remarkable story.

2654
02:27:26,629 --> 02:27:30,000
Priscilla Presley's devastating account

2655
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
of life and death in the eye of the storm.

2656
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,500
Elvis and me.

2657
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:38,500
Sunday.

2658
02:27:38,500 --> 02:27:43,459
Here is a group of people who were going along

2659
02:27:43,459 --> 02:27:45,459
doing what they do better than they'd ever done it before

2660
02:27:45,459 --> 02:27:47,459
and someone came along and pulled the rug out.

2661
02:27:47,459 --> 02:27:49,459
It was a struggle for survival.

2662
02:27:49,459 --> 02:27:53,459
Peter Jennings reporting from the heart of Harlem, Thursday.

2663
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:58,110
Let's say buenos dias.

2664
02:27:58,110 --> 02:28:00,110
To breakfast and tortillas.

2665
02:28:00,110 --> 02:28:02,110
Come on, Ramos.

2666
02:28:02,110 --> 02:28:05,780
Let's go.

2667
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:06,780
See it's so close.

2668
02:28:06,780 --> 02:28:09,780
McDonald's introduces the breakfast burrito.

2669
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:10,780
Scrambled waffles.

2670
02:28:10,780 --> 02:28:11,780
Desserts and aprons.

2671
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:13,780
Sausage, onions, and tomatoes.

2672
02:28:13,780 --> 02:28:14,780
Don't forget the cheese.

2673
02:28:14,780 --> 02:28:17,110
Why did they do this?

2674
02:28:17,110 --> 02:28:18,110
$0.99 each.

2675
02:28:18,110 --> 02:28:20,110
McDonald's today.

2676
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:23,860
McDonald's did breakfast burritos.

2677
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:25,860
I feel like those probably were really good.

2678
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:29,000
They still actually make them.

2679
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,620
They still make them?

2680
02:28:30,620 --> 02:28:31,620
Breakfast burrito.

2681
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:32,620
Only $0.99 each.

2682
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,620
They still do.

2683
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,620
They are really good.

2684
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,620
Oh.

2685
02:28:35,620 --> 02:28:36,930
All right.

2686
02:28:36,930 --> 02:28:37,930
I know what I'm getting next.

2687
02:28:37,930 --> 02:28:45,049
My chill out gives us permission to let our hair down.

2688
02:28:45,049 --> 02:28:49,229
What is it, chiller?

2689
02:28:49,229 --> 02:28:50,229
I don't know.

2690
02:28:50,229 --> 02:28:53,600
But what else am I going to do this summer?

2691
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:56,600
It's games, promotions, fun, and free costs.

2692
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:58,600
It's like Woodstock, man.

2693
02:28:58,600 --> 02:29:03,600
It's people in tight pants moving fast.

2694
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:10,020
For my family, Tartar Control Aquafresh fights tartar.

2695
02:29:10,020 --> 02:29:12,020
What makes you feel this fresh?

2696
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:15,020
Tartar Control Aquafresh helps remove plaque.

2697
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:17,020
What makes you feel this fresh?

2698
02:29:17,020 --> 02:29:19,020
Tartar Control Aquafresh fights cavities.

2699
02:29:19,020 --> 02:29:21,020
What makes you feel this fresh?

2700
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:23,020
Only Tartar Control Aquafresh is the...

2701
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:26,020
Why are you bringing a toothpaste to a water park?

2702
02:29:26,020 --> 02:29:27,020
I'm sorry.

2703
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:32,020
If you have a full tube of toothpaste in the box and you bring that to the water park,

2704
02:29:32,020 --> 02:29:36,659
I feel like you're kind of strange.

2705
02:29:36,659 --> 02:29:41,340
That's strange.

2706
02:29:41,340 --> 02:29:42,340
You never know.

2707
02:29:42,340 --> 02:29:45,280
Aquafresh...

2708
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,860
Aquafresh...

2709
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:50,860
What does Aquafresh Riz mean?

2710
02:29:50,860 --> 02:29:52,860
Aquafresh Riz?

2711
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:55,860
Tartar Control in tight pants moving fast.

2712
02:29:55,860 --> 02:30:04,069
For my family, Tartar Control Aquafresh fights tartar.

2713
02:30:04,069 --> 02:30:06,069
What makes you feel this fresh?

2714
02:30:06,069 --> 02:30:09,069
Tartar Control Aquafresh helps remove plaque.

2715
02:30:09,069 --> 02:30:11,069
What makes you feel this fresh?

2716
02:30:11,069 --> 02:30:13,069
Tartar Control Aquafresh fights cavities.

2717
02:30:13,069 --> 02:30:15,069
What makes you feel this fresh?

2718
02:30:15,069 --> 02:30:17,069
Don't drop it! Don't drop it!

2719
02:30:17,069 --> 02:30:21,069
Tartar Control Aquafresh is the fresh way to fight cavities, fight plaque, and fight tartar,

2720
02:30:21,069 --> 02:30:24,069
all with one great Aquafresh taste.

2721
02:30:24,069 --> 02:30:26,069
Tartar Control Aquafresh!

2722
02:30:26,069 --> 02:30:27,069
It fights tartar...

2723
02:30:27,069 --> 02:30:30,069
And makes you feel this fresh!

2724
02:30:30,069 --> 02:30:35,440
I've got great news for everyone who uses bleach to clean up the kitchen and bath.

2725
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:39,440
New Clorox Cleanup is a bleach specially designed for cleaning.

2726
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:44,440
You see, Clorox added a special cleaner to bleach, so it cleans even better.

2727
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:50,440
Now you can clean up stains, clean up germs, and clean up greasy dirt bleach alone leaves behind.

2728
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:56,440
So, when you reach for a bleach to clean up, reach for the one with the special cleaner inside.

2729
02:30:56,440 --> 02:30:57,440
New Clorox Cleanup.

2730
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:01,440
When you want to reach for bleach, just get bleach, right?

2731
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,440
What would they add?

2732
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:05,260
Come to AC this fall.

2733
02:31:05,260 --> 02:31:07,260
The war is over.

2734
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:09,260
A celebration has begun.

2735
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:12,260
It's better. It's different.

2736
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:14,260
Boys have returned as men.

2737
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:16,260
Bleach is not a good cleaner. It's kind of toxic.

2738
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:18,260
To open arms, to laughter, and to love.

2739
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:20,260
Yeah, but I mean, just in general though, bleach is...

2740
02:31:20,260 --> 02:31:23,260
The whole time I was over there, all I thought about was you.

2741
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:27,260
I thought it was like the ultimate in like removal of everything.

2742
02:31:27,260 --> 02:31:29,260
These are their stories of triumph.

2743
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:32,260
This is an oppressive record, soldier.

2744
02:31:32,260 --> 02:31:33,260
And despair.

2745
02:31:33,260 --> 02:31:35,260
They can't pay you less than other men on the line.

2746
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:37,260
They can if I'm a janitor.

2747
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:39,260
Their hope for the future.

2748
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:41,260
Hank has been fighting a war, not dating.

2749
02:31:41,260 --> 02:31:43,260
Their dreams left behind.

2750
02:31:43,260 --> 02:31:45,260
Americans are wonderful people.

2751
02:31:45,260 --> 02:31:47,260
Linda, if you'd made an effort to pretty yourself up,

2752
02:31:47,260 --> 02:31:49,260
you wouldn't have lost Mike to some Italian.

2753
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:52,260
They became wartime heroes.

2754
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:54,260
Now they've returned to the home front.

2755
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:56,260
Bro, I can't believe you're an adult.

2756
02:31:56,260 --> 02:31:57,260
What? Why?

2757
02:31:57,260 --> 02:32:00,260
But America is watching ABC.

2758
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:03,260
Hey, you can't know everything about everything.

2759
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:05,260
China Beach will continue.

2760
02:32:05,260 --> 02:32:07,260
I know very little, and I'm telling you that.

2761
02:32:07,260 --> 02:32:10,260
You can't know everything. You can't know everything about everything.

2762
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:14,260
Should government require business to guarantee parental leave?

2763
02:32:14,260 --> 02:32:20,139
They tried it in Rhode Island on ABC's World News Tonight this week.

2764
02:32:20,139 --> 02:32:22,139
This is a Channel 7 News Brief.

2765
02:32:22,139 --> 02:32:25,139
San Francisco police tonight are investigating why it happened.

2766
02:32:25,139 --> 02:32:29,139
A tour bus careened down a street and slammed into a child care center in San Francisco.

2767
02:32:29,139 --> 02:32:30,139
He's so right for that.

2768
02:32:30,139 --> 02:32:33,139
The force was so tremendous, the bus smashed through the walls.

2769
02:32:33,139 --> 02:32:35,139
No one was in the child care center.

2770
02:32:35,139 --> 02:32:36,139
Holy shit.

2771
02:32:36,139 --> 02:32:37,139
The driver of the bus was killed.

2772
02:32:37,139 --> 02:32:40,139
One county in the Bay Area is looking at a new source of water

2773
02:32:40,139 --> 02:32:41,139
What?

2774
02:32:41,139 --> 02:32:45,139
Rock stars are telling rock fans about the growing problem of hearing loss.

2775
02:32:45,139 --> 02:32:46,139
And what's hot in fashion?

2776
02:32:46,139 --> 02:32:49,139
Clothes that change colors all by temperature.

2777
02:32:49,139 --> 02:32:51,139
See it on 7 at 11.

2778
02:32:51,139 --> 02:32:52,139
What?

2779
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:56,040
Hey, listen to this.

2780
02:32:56,040 --> 02:32:58,040
Wait, they showed them.

2781
02:32:58,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Wait, what?

2782
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
A green conditioner as much as a salon brand.

2783
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:03,040
Oh my, oh my god.

2784
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:04,040
I didn't see that.

2785
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:05,040
Holy shit.

2786
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,040
Would you switch?

2787
02:33:06,040 --> 02:33:07,040
Agree.

2788
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:08,040
It's that good.

2789
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:10,040
Oh, oh fuck.

2790
02:33:10,040 --> 02:33:14,040
I was more wondering about sex.

2791
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:15,040
No reason not to have sex.

2792
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,040
Sex is definitely in the mind.

2793
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:19,040
Sex.

2794
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:20,040
Call it what you will.

2795
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:22,040
It's still sex.

2796
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:23,040
That's awful.

2797
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,040
30 something returns Tuesday.

2798
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:30,620
Get ready to feel softer.

2799
02:33:36,739 --> 02:33:39,170
Caress with its silky touch of bath oil.

2800
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:41,170
Leave skin softer than soap can.

2801
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:46,940
Get ready to feel your softest.

2802
02:33:47,940 --> 02:33:52,819
It looks so right in the shine tonight.

2803
02:33:52,819 --> 02:33:54,819
Before you dress, caress.

2804
02:33:54,819 --> 02:33:55,819
All right, we're almost through.

2805
02:33:55,819 --> 02:33:56,819
We're almost through this one.

2806
02:33:56,819 --> 02:33:59,819
I won't wear anything without cross your heart.

2807
02:33:59,819 --> 02:34:01,819
Because great looks start with cross your heart.

2808
02:34:01,819 --> 02:34:04,819
With crisscross shaping, I always look better.

2809
02:34:04,819 --> 02:34:05,819
The cross your heart bra.

2810
02:34:05,819 --> 02:34:07,819
Great looks start with cross your heart.

2811
02:34:07,819 --> 02:34:08,819
From Playtex.

2812
02:34:08,819 --> 02:34:10,819
The fit that makes the fashion.

2813
02:34:12,819 --> 02:34:21,479
Oh, I forgot about the little 7-Up guy.

2814
02:34:21,479 --> 02:34:26,469
What happened to the little 7-Up guy?

2815
02:34:26,469 --> 02:34:33,280
Hey, thanks, man.

2816
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:34,280
Stay cool.

2817
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:40,139
7-Up.

2818
02:34:40,139 --> 02:34:41,139
The cool spot.

2819
02:34:41,139 --> 02:34:42,139
I liked that one.

2820
02:34:42,139 --> 02:34:43,139
That was cool.

2821
02:34:43,139 --> 02:34:44,139
Let me show you how the educated consumer

2822
02:34:44,139 --> 02:34:46,139
can tell the difference between my deli meat

2823
02:34:46,139 --> 02:34:48,139
and Oscar Mayer deli thin slices.

2824
02:34:48,139 --> 02:34:50,139
Now, you can't go by looks or taste.

2825
02:34:50,139 --> 02:34:52,139
On the conner, they're both sliced fresh.

2826
02:34:52,139 --> 02:34:53,139
Real thin.

2827
02:34:53,139 --> 02:34:56,139
But my deli meat comes in this beautiful white paper.

2828
02:34:56,139 --> 02:34:59,139
See how nice you can write?

2829
02:34:59,139 --> 02:35:02,139
But Oscar Mayer comes in this resealable bag.

2830
02:35:02,139 --> 02:35:03,139
Who cares?

2831
02:35:07,139 --> 02:35:08,139
This one comes in plastic.

2832
02:35:08,139 --> 02:35:09,139
Mine comes in paper.

2833
02:35:10,139 --> 02:35:12,139
What a disgusting difference.

2834
02:35:12,139 --> 02:35:15,139
Can you believe it when some margarine say buttery taste

2835
02:35:15,139 --> 02:35:17,139
and there's no butter in them?

2836
02:35:17,139 --> 02:35:21,139
Kraft touch of butter spread has rich, creamy butter in it.

2837
02:35:21,139 --> 02:35:22,139
Just a touch.

2838
02:35:22,139 --> 02:35:24,139
Kraft touch of butter.

2839
02:35:24,139 --> 02:35:27,139
A touch of real butter makes a real difference.

2840
02:35:27,139 --> 02:35:28,450
Hi, this is Suzanne Summers.

2841
02:35:28,450 --> 02:35:30,450
All this week, I'm hosting the new...

2842
02:35:30,450 --> 02:35:31,450
All right, we went, we got through it.

2843
02:35:31,450 --> 02:35:32,450
I'm having John Snyder...

2844
02:35:32,450 --> 02:35:34,450
That was an hour and 24 minutes we stayed on this one.

2845
02:35:34,450 --> 02:35:35,450
...in my old friend Norman Falcon 3's company.

2846
02:35:35,450 --> 02:35:37,450
Check out Into the Night.

2847
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:38,879
Huh?

2848
02:35:38,879 --> 02:35:40,879
All right, that's it.

2849
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:41,879
My pit rate's probably awful.

2850
02:35:41,879 --> 02:35:43,879
Am I a little blurry right now?

2851
02:35:43,879 --> 02:35:51,569
I...

2852
02:35:51,569 --> 02:35:52,569
Margarine versus butter.

2853
02:35:52,569 --> 02:35:53,569
I don't...

2854
02:35:53,569 --> 02:35:54,569
I feel like I know what margarine tastes like,

2855
02:35:54,569 --> 02:35:56,510
but it's kind of...

2856
02:35:56,510 --> 02:35:59,510
It's lost to how butter tastes.

2857
02:35:59,510 --> 02:36:02,579
There's a whole day's work in every...

2858
02:36:02,579 --> 02:36:03,889
All right, let's do another one.

2859
02:36:03,889 --> 02:36:06,409
I should have another one here.

2860
02:36:06,409 --> 02:36:08,579
I have a few, actually.

2861
02:36:08,579 --> 02:36:12,379
This one...

2862
02:36:12,379 --> 02:36:19,459
Oh, this one's old Nickelodeon ads.

2863
02:36:19,459 --> 02:36:20,459
I'm curious about this one.

2864
02:36:20,459 --> 02:36:21,459
1993.

2865
02:36:21,459 --> 02:36:30,229
Let's try this one.

2866
02:36:30,229 --> 02:36:33,559
1993.

2867
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:41,459
Rugrats!

2868
02:36:41,459 --> 02:36:49,479
Glass Geek Supo.

2869
02:36:49,479 --> 02:36:57,579
This is unlocking so many memories.

2870
02:36:57,579 --> 02:37:00,459
Saturday night has arrived.

2871
02:37:00,459 --> 02:37:03,959
And Saturday night belongs to Snick.

2872
02:37:03,959 --> 02:37:06,159
That...

2873
02:37:06,159 --> 02:37:09,870
Blah, blah, blah.

2874
02:37:09,870 --> 02:37:12,870
Here's Benjamin Hall on the Jaguar system to place Cybermorph.

2875
02:37:12,870 --> 02:37:14,870
Let's see how those beastly graphics and intricate moves

2876
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:17,870
have only come from 64 bits of mega-power field.

2877
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:21,520
Cybermorph only on Jaguar...

2878
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,520
Why?

2879
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:24,520
Why did he puke?

2880
02:37:24,520 --> 02:37:27,520
Why did he puke into the lens of the camera?

2881
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:36,520
He just hurled directly into the camera lens.

2882
02:37:51,209 --> 02:37:52,209
This one's crusty.

2883
02:38:04,209 --> 02:38:09,770
The Muppets is so great.

2884
02:38:09,770 --> 02:38:11,770
Go watch all the movies back-to-back.

2885
02:38:13,770 --> 02:38:15,770
Ooh, what's this thing?

2886
02:38:18,770 --> 02:38:20,770
Super Van City!

2887
02:38:33,260 --> 02:38:36,260
Whoa, that thing's way cooler.

2888
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,260
And I don't know, something that's cool.

2889
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:43,459
Real power tools.

2890
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:49,700
Is that Dad back there?

2891
02:38:49,700 --> 02:38:56,450
Whoa.

2892
02:39:08,120 --> 02:39:10,120
Are you supervising back there, Dad?

2893
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:30,190
Dude, you know what I want to watch so bad on-screen if I could?

2894
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:32,190
I wonder if I can.

2895
02:40:34,190 --> 02:40:36,190
Do you guys remember Crash Box?

2896
02:40:36,190 --> 02:40:37,750
On HBO.

2897
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:43,510
Crash Box was fucking unbelievable.

2898
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:47,510
That's one of the best shows for, like, a young audience.

2899
02:40:47,510 --> 02:40:56,540
I'm thinking the same thing.

2900
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:58,540
Yeah, that's exactly the first thing I thought of when I saw that.

2901
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:07,670
Crash Box was so good, man.

2902
02:41:10,549 --> 02:41:14,549
I actually took a lot of inspiration from Crash Box.

2903
02:41:16,549 --> 02:41:20,549
I was watching that show during my formative years.

2904
02:41:21,549 --> 02:41:24,549
Strange and powerful forces are attracting people to Pizza Hut.

2905
02:41:24,549 --> 02:41:26,549
It's the Marvel Comics X-Men video.

2906
02:41:26,549 --> 02:41:30,549
With a mini comic book, pull-out poster, and trading card.

2907
02:41:30,549 --> 02:41:33,549
All for only $4.99 with any pizza purchase.

2908
02:41:33,549 --> 02:41:35,549
You're gonna do it.

2909
02:41:36,549 --> 02:41:39,329
Yes!

2910
02:41:39,329 --> 02:41:49,040
Wrap that up.

2911
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,040
Exclusive at Pizza Hut.

2912
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:52,040
Strongest power.

2913
02:41:52,040 --> 02:41:56,040
Tamed by success, the turtles lost their savage edge.

2914
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:58,040
Greed is dead.

2915
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:00,040
The new breed carved from the streets.

2916
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:03,040
Concrete fist, batter, alien flesh.

2917
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:04,040
One-on-one.

2918
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:05,040
Wait, is this a...

2919
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,040
There was a game.

2920
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:09,040
With rage, ripping through fear.

2921
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:12,760
It's a tear.

2922
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:14,760
I remember this game.

2923
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,389
Soft shells, hosts of reality.

2924
02:42:18,389 --> 02:42:20,389
It was the fighting game.

2925
02:42:20,389 --> 02:42:22,889
This game was awesome.

2926
02:42:22,889 --> 02:42:24,889
I gotta play this.

2927
02:42:24,889 --> 02:42:26,889
I gotta play this.

2928
02:42:26,889 --> 02:42:28,889
By the Super NES Super Set.

2929
02:42:28,889 --> 02:42:30,889
And get five complete Mario games.

2930
02:42:30,889 --> 02:42:31,889
Standard.

2931
02:42:31,889 --> 02:42:33,889
You'll find the Super Set is like no other...

2932
02:42:33,889 --> 02:42:35,889
This is like the equivalent of the Orange Box.

2933
02:42:35,889 --> 02:42:37,889
Performance, handling, and mode seven control.

2934
02:42:37,889 --> 02:42:39,889
You'll get Super Mario World.

2935
02:42:39,889 --> 02:42:42,889
And for $3.50 in postage, Super Mario All-Stars free.

2936
02:42:42,889 --> 02:42:44,889
With four Mario games in one.

2937
02:42:44,889 --> 02:42:45,889
Mario.

2938
02:42:45,889 --> 02:42:47,889
So stop by your Nintendo dealer today.

2939
02:42:47,889 --> 02:42:48,889
Your Nintendo.

2940
02:42:48,889 --> 02:42:51,770
It's not like a car company.

2941
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:53,770
They're presenting it like a car, too, weirdly enough.

2942
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:56,899
Hey, that's me.

2943
02:42:56,899 --> 02:42:58,899
The kid with the cool clothes.

2944
02:42:58,899 --> 02:43:00,979
That's my little name.

2945
02:43:00,979 --> 02:43:01,979
Cool, too.

2946
02:43:01,979 --> 02:43:02,979
That's the joke.

2947
02:43:03,979 --> 02:43:04,979
Oh.

2948
02:43:04,979 --> 02:43:05,979
Right.

2949
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:06,979
Yeah.

2950
02:43:06,979 --> 02:43:07,979
Yeah.

2951
02:43:07,979 --> 02:43:09,979
Yeah, that's what I meant.

2952
02:43:09,979 --> 02:43:10,979
That was the whole bit.

2953
02:43:10,979 --> 02:43:11,979
Yeah.

2954
02:43:13,979 --> 02:43:14,979
That was, yeah.

2955
02:43:14,979 --> 02:43:15,979
I know.

2956
02:43:15,979 --> 02:43:16,979
I know.

2957
02:43:16,979 --> 02:43:18,979
Cool clothes for cool kids.

2958
02:43:18,979 --> 02:43:20,979
At prizes even your mom will like.

2959
02:43:20,979 --> 02:43:22,979
Shop and save at Happy Days.

2960
02:43:22,979 --> 02:43:27,979
The Disney Channel presents new episodes of one of our most popular series, Avonlea.

2961
02:43:27,979 --> 02:43:29,979
These will be very exciting moments.

2962
02:43:29,979 --> 02:43:30,979
What is it called?

2963
02:43:30,979 --> 02:43:35,979
The Cable Ace award winning series continues to attract a variety of exciting guest stars.

2964
02:43:35,979 --> 02:43:40,979
In December, watch for Diana Rigg and Robbie Benson in an episode full of mystery.

2965
02:43:40,979 --> 02:43:41,979
I don't remember this.

2966
02:43:41,979 --> 02:43:42,979
And suspense.

2967
02:43:42,979 --> 02:43:44,979
All will be revealed in two course.

2968
02:43:44,979 --> 02:43:47,979
It's a special Avonlea only on the Disney Channel.

2969
02:43:48,979 --> 02:43:50,979
It's the most popular show on the network, apparently.

2970
02:43:51,979 --> 02:43:54,690
Watching.

2971
02:43:54,690 --> 02:43:55,690
Nick!

2972
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:58,120
And back to Clarissa explains it all.

2973
02:43:58,120 --> 02:43:59,120
Oh.

2974
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:01,120
I was going to say, I hope you hear the names.

2975
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:03,120
Are you afraid of the dark is up next.

2976
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:04,120
Extra early this week.

2977
02:44:04,120 --> 02:44:06,120
Followed by Ren and Stimpy's.

2978
02:44:06,120 --> 02:44:07,120
Are you afraid of the dark?

2979
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:09,120
It's such a wild show.

2980
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:10,120
Son of Stimpy.

2981
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:12,120
So sneak right where you are.

2982
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:14,940
Are you afraid of the dark?

2983
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:18,940
They kind of sat around and they made up the stories and then they threw this like weird dust.

2984
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:19,940
Clarissa explains it all.

2985
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:21,940
They used to throw the dust into the fire, right?

2986
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:22,940
At Universal Studios.

2987
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:23,940
Orlando.

2988
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:25,940
And then all of them would sit around and they would just hallucinate.

2989
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:30,290
Whatever the person was talking about.

2990
02:44:30,290 --> 02:44:31,290
It was in that dust.

2991
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:32,780
Stay with the program.

2992
02:44:32,780 --> 02:44:37,159
Sneaking.

2993
02:44:37,159 --> 02:44:38,159
Kellogg's frosted mini wheats?

2994
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:39,159
No, Sid and I.

2995
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:40,159
So grown up.

2996
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:41,159
Oh, he's eating so sensibly.

2997
02:44:41,159 --> 02:44:43,159
Well, he knows just how cool this stuff is.

2998
02:44:43,159 --> 02:44:45,159
Just check out all that whole grain wheat.

2999
02:44:45,159 --> 02:44:46,159
Whole grain wheat.

3000
02:44:46,159 --> 02:44:47,159
Very nutritious.

3001
02:44:47,159 --> 02:44:48,159
He's definitely.

3002
02:44:48,159 --> 02:44:49,159
Can't see this frosted.

3003
02:44:49,159 --> 02:44:51,159
I'm going to talk like this when I'm a dad.

3004
02:44:51,159 --> 02:44:52,159
Genius.

3005
02:44:52,159 --> 02:44:53,159
Should eat.

3006
02:44:53,159 --> 02:44:56,159
Kellogg's frosted mini wheats taste so good, who cares about anything else?

3007
02:44:56,159 --> 02:44:58,159
Besides, it's part of this complete breakfast.

3008
02:44:58,159 --> 02:45:00,159
We know what's absolutely nutritious.

3009
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:02,159
Writing his dissertation on world peace.

3010
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:03,159
Oh, there you go.

3011
02:45:03,159 --> 02:45:04,159
All right.

3012
02:45:04,159 --> 02:45:08,219
That cinnamon toast crunch.

3013
02:45:09,219 --> 02:45:10,219
I see that.

3014
02:45:10,219 --> 02:45:11,219
Mrs. Crotty.

3015
02:45:11,219 --> 02:45:12,219
She sees everything.

3016
02:45:12,219 --> 02:45:16,219
So can you see what gives cinnamon toast crunch its intense taste?

3017
02:45:16,219 --> 02:45:18,219
It must be something sneaky.

3018
02:45:19,219 --> 02:45:20,219
What?

3019
02:45:20,219 --> 02:45:21,219
It's obvious to any kid.

3020
02:45:21,219 --> 02:45:24,219
The cinnamon and sugar squelch all over every bite.

3021
02:45:24,219 --> 02:45:25,219
It's covered in cinnamon.

3022
02:45:25,219 --> 02:45:27,219
For a totally intense taste, you can see.

3023
02:45:27,219 --> 02:45:30,219
Cinnamon toast crunch is part of this complete breakfast.

3024
02:45:30,219 --> 02:45:32,219
Cinnamon and sugar, huh?

3025
02:45:32,219 --> 02:45:33,219
Looks pretty wild.

3026
02:45:33,219 --> 02:45:35,219
No wonder kids love it.

3027
02:45:35,219 --> 02:45:36,219
Connects.

3028
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:47,819
The these things are off.

3029
02:45:47,819 --> 02:45:55,790
I love the way that it sounded when you snapped them together.

3030
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:56,790
They made it.

3031
02:45:56,790 --> 02:45:58,790
It was such a great sound.

3032
02:45:58,790 --> 02:46:00,969
That was half the fun.

3033
02:46:00,969 --> 02:46:01,969
Connects.

3034
02:46:01,969 --> 02:46:04,969
The new snap together color coded construction set.

3035
02:46:08,959 --> 02:46:09,959
These ones aren't even funny.

3036
02:46:09,959 --> 02:46:10,959
They're just cool.

3037
02:46:10,959 --> 02:46:25,139
Racing aerodynamics, sleek stabilizer rods and the exclusive two speed power shifter.

3038
02:46:25,139 --> 02:46:27,440
You're on more than this bike around.

3039
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:28,440
You're on the fastest.

3040
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:29,440
Bikes were so huge.

3041
02:46:30,440 --> 02:46:32,829
Afterburner.

3042
02:46:32,829 --> 02:46:33,829
Only from Murray.

3043
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:36,829
Bike brands were actually car companies.

3044
02:46:36,829 --> 02:46:38,829
Some play games that go away.

3045
02:46:39,829 --> 02:46:41,829
And some play BMW.

3046
02:46:41,829 --> 02:46:42,829
Oh, you drive a BMW.

3047
02:46:42,829 --> 02:46:45,829
Nintendo's new Honda.

3048
02:46:45,829 --> 02:46:48,829
Pinball video game called Kirby's Pinball Land.

3049
02:46:48,829 --> 02:46:54,290
And Kirby's the place.

3050
02:46:54,290 --> 02:46:56,290
All you do is keep Kirby.

3051
02:46:57,290 --> 02:46:58,290
I was so bad at this game.

3052
02:46:58,290 --> 02:47:00,290
I hated it as long as you can.

3053
02:47:01,290 --> 02:47:04,290
Get Nintendo's new Kirby Spinball Land for Game Boy.

3054
02:47:04,290 --> 02:47:05,290
And we'll bet you won't go.

3055
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:08,530
Joy to the world.

3056
02:47:08,530 --> 02:47:09,530
I was so bad at it.

3057
02:47:09,530 --> 02:47:11,530
I just didn't like it because I was bad at it.

3058
02:47:13,729 --> 02:47:16,729
Holidays from the Rugrats and Nickelodeon.

3059
02:47:16,729 --> 02:47:17,899
Afraid of the dark?

3060
02:47:17,899 --> 02:47:20,899
Stay in the glow of the couch and stay tuned.

3061
02:47:20,899 --> 02:47:21,899
The orange couch.

3062
02:47:21,899 --> 02:47:22,899
I remember the orange couch.

3063
02:47:22,899 --> 02:47:23,899
Tonight's Ren and Stimpy.

3064
02:47:23,899 --> 02:47:33,850
A new episode.

3065
02:47:33,850 --> 02:47:34,850
Did it ever land on old?

3066
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:35,850
Tonight on stick.

3067
02:47:45,469 --> 02:47:47,469
Did I ever tell you guys the idea that I wanted to do?

3068
02:47:47,469 --> 02:47:52,979
I wanted to get a shitload of these.

3069
02:47:52,979 --> 02:47:58,760
These old weird fucked up 80s and 90s games.

3070
02:47:58,760 --> 02:48:00,760
These weird like board games.

3071
02:48:00,760 --> 02:48:03,260
And I wanted to get a bunch of streamers.

3072
02:48:03,260 --> 02:48:05,260
And do like a competition with them.

3073
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:06,750
Just play them all.

3074
02:48:06,750 --> 02:48:07,750
Play like 20 of them.

3075
02:48:07,750 --> 02:48:13,700
Over the course of like a couple days.

3076
02:48:13,700 --> 02:48:14,700
I think they'd be kind of fun.

3077
02:48:14,700 --> 02:48:21,420
Put some weird stakes on it too.

3078
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:32,290
I think it could be kind of fun.

3079
02:48:32,290 --> 02:48:34,100
Maybe.

3080
02:48:35,860 --> 02:48:37,860
And when I say a bunch of streamers.

3081
02:48:37,860 --> 02:48:40,909
I mean like two.

3082
02:48:40,909 --> 02:48:41,909
Or like three.

3083
02:48:41,909 --> 02:48:45,670
About like 20.

3084
02:48:48,040 --> 02:48:51,040
What is this?

3085
02:48:57,309 --> 02:48:59,309
This is wearing these weird plague doctor masks.

3086
02:48:59,309 --> 02:49:01,309
That's kind of creepy.

3087
02:49:01,309 --> 02:49:05,370
Is this the crazy?

3088
02:49:07,370 --> 02:49:09,670
You put it together dolls and fashion souls

3089
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:14,299
separately.

3090
02:49:25,979 --> 02:49:27,979
I'm, I'm just going to say it.

3091
02:49:29,979 --> 02:49:30,979
Barbie stuff.

3092
02:49:30,979 --> 02:49:31,979
That was crazy.

3093
02:49:31,979 --> 02:49:34,979
That was super super cool.

3094
02:49:34,979 --> 02:49:37,500
working electricity and shit in there.

3095
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:39,260
Mario games standard.

3096
02:49:39,260 --> 02:49:43,180
You'll find the superset is like no other system of shit

3097
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:45,540
performance, handling, and mode seven control.

3098
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:47,579
You'll get super Mario world.

3099
02:49:47,579 --> 02:49:50,620
Yeah, oh no, my Barbie mansion has a working jacuzzi.

3100
02:49:50,620 --> 02:49:53,000
Four Mario games in one.

3101
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:53,819
Excuse me?

3102
02:49:53,819 --> 02:49:54,659
So stop by your Nintendo.

3103
02:49:54,659 --> 02:49:56,600
Oh yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait, you don't have that?

3104
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:59,299
You don't forget to super contend those supersets.

3105
02:49:59,299 --> 02:50:01,940
Oh, and the lights can change freedom colors.

3106
02:50:01,940 --> 02:50:03,620
It's Batman at his best.

3107
02:50:03,620 --> 02:50:05,299
Super charged with power.

3108
02:50:05,299 --> 02:50:07,780
The turbo fat plane soars at breakneck speed.

3109
02:50:07,780 --> 02:50:08,819
It's Catwoman.

3110
02:50:08,819 --> 02:50:10,860
Fearing the killer claw, she leaps to safety.

3111
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:12,100
Look out!

3112
02:50:12,100 --> 02:50:14,899
This feline's got her own set of claws.

3113
02:50:14,899 --> 02:50:18,659
But Megwing Batman can rise above this cat fight.

3114
02:50:18,659 --> 02:50:19,780
He fires.

3115
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:21,579
The evil and figures hold separately.

3116
02:50:21,579 --> 02:50:24,819
Batman, the best just got better.

3117
02:50:24,819 --> 02:50:26,860
Look for America's favorite hero at this Christmas

3118
02:50:26,860 --> 02:50:28,340
in the animated movie, Batman.

3119
02:50:28,340 --> 02:50:30,899
See where the inspiration of the Grotto Beast commercial

3120
02:50:30,899 --> 02:50:31,739
came from.

3121
02:50:31,739 --> 02:50:32,659
Now the sneaking begins again with

3122
02:50:32,659 --> 02:50:33,739
Are You Afraid of the Dog?

3123
02:50:33,819 --> 02:50:35,219
We watched a lot of these.

3124
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:40,219
Now get ready for Ren and Stimpy's long awaited

3125
02:50:40,219 --> 02:50:42,100
snow-filled saga.

3126
02:50:42,100 --> 02:50:46,459
Son of Stimpy, the heartwarming, heart-burning,

3127
02:50:46,459 --> 02:50:49,500
dead-of-winter tale of Ren and Stimpy and Stinky.

3128
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:51,459
Next on Snick.

3129
02:50:51,459 --> 02:50:54,299
That's another job that I think would be so much fun.

3130
02:50:54,299 --> 02:50:59,180
Being the voiceover, the narrator in between

3131
02:50:59,180 --> 02:51:02,040
television shows, especially for a kid's network,

3132
02:51:02,040 --> 02:51:03,540
I feel like it would be so much fun.

3133
02:51:04,299 --> 02:51:08,979
Stay tuned for the wild, wacky world of Ren and Stimpy.

3134
02:51:08,979 --> 02:51:10,899
Coming up next on Nickelodeon.

3135
02:51:10,899 --> 02:51:13,739
I would have loved that job.

3136
02:51:13,739 --> 02:51:16,020
That sounds like a lot of fun.

3137
02:51:18,049 --> 02:51:22,159
Keep basking in the glow of the big Snick

3138
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:24,280
will continue after these messages.

3139
02:51:28,690 --> 02:51:30,770
All right, we'll do like 10 more.

3140
02:51:30,770 --> 02:51:32,209
You've got to make a stand.

3141
02:51:32,209 --> 02:51:33,770
That's what the X-Men are all about.

3142
02:51:33,770 --> 02:51:35,729
Man or mutant, it's all the same.

3143
02:51:35,729 --> 02:51:36,930
Heights against evil.

3144
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:38,049
Marvel Comics X-Men.

3145
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:39,530
Jiggleberry's narrations, so.

3146
02:51:43,690 --> 02:51:45,329
This thing went so hard.

3147
02:51:45,329 --> 02:51:46,610
The old X-Men show.

3148
02:51:48,209 --> 02:51:49,049
It's so good.

3149
02:51:57,579 --> 02:51:58,700
You're a little quiet.

3150
02:51:58,700 --> 02:52:00,299
I think this is a good job.

3151
02:52:02,299 --> 02:52:03,139
We already saw this one.

3152
02:52:03,139 --> 02:52:03,979
It's a repeat.

3153
02:52:07,329 --> 02:52:08,170
I think it's because this thing,

3154
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:13,959
I turned it up loud so you could hear that.

3155
02:52:13,959 --> 02:52:16,840
Peaceful land, paradise is threatened

3156
02:52:16,840 --> 02:52:18,559
by an unspeakable evil.

3157
02:52:19,239 --> 02:52:21,159
And only one person has found the power

3158
02:52:21,159 --> 02:52:23,040
to restore perfect order.

3159
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:27,360
In a new action adventure game for your super NES

3160
02:52:27,360 --> 02:52:32,000
comes an exciting tale, the secret of mana.

3161
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,360
Wow.

3162
02:52:33,360 --> 02:52:36,600
Oh, Bat Chest, I know, whatever.

3163
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:38,360
Whatever, go ahead and do it.

3164
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,159
Did you eat too much?

3165
02:52:41,159 --> 02:52:42,000
Oh yeah.

3166
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,229
Oh no.

3167
02:52:44,229 --> 02:52:45,500
Oh yeah.

3168
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:48,059
But it's so much fun to eat and love.

3169
02:52:48,059 --> 02:52:48,899
Oh yeah.

3170
02:52:48,899 --> 02:52:49,739
You see what I'm saying?

3171
02:52:50,059 --> 02:52:51,899
This is just pure content.

3172
02:52:51,899 --> 02:52:53,379
First defeat Ralph, all their food wins,

3173
02:52:53,379 --> 02:52:55,819
but be careful, cause you never know.

3174
02:52:55,819 --> 02:52:56,659
Eat it, Ralph.

3175
02:52:56,659 --> 02:52:57,500
Oh yeah.

3176
02:52:57,500 --> 02:53:00,500
You know it's so much fun to eat it, Ralph.

3177
02:53:00,500 --> 02:53:01,500
Oh yeah.

3178
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:03,219
Watch out, here he comes.

3179
02:53:03,219 --> 02:53:04,059
Eat it, Ralph.

3180
02:53:04,059 --> 02:53:04,899
Oh yeah.

3181
02:53:04,899 --> 02:53:05,739
What was I gonna say about this?

3182
02:53:05,739 --> 02:53:06,579
I was gonna say something, hold on.

3183
02:53:06,579 --> 02:53:08,620
What was the last commercial?

3184
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:10,819
Oh, right, so I'm telling you I'm like,

3185
02:53:10,819 --> 02:53:13,540
oh what, a Bat Chest, right, the secret of mana.

3186
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:15,030
The secret of mana.

3187
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:16,709
Oh, legendary video game.

3188
02:53:16,709 --> 02:53:19,280
One of the best, one of the greatest.

3189
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:21,000
I like kind of pretend that I,

3190
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,079
so my experience with the mana series,

3191
02:53:23,079 --> 02:53:24,440
especially secret of mana,

3192
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:27,920
was renting this game from the store rental place,

3193
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:29,809
the video game rental,

3194
02:53:29,809 --> 02:53:31,770
and opening up somebody else's save file,

3195
02:53:31,770 --> 02:53:33,129
I believe is what it was.

3196
02:53:33,129 --> 02:53:35,690
Walking around, not understanding what was going on,

3197
02:53:35,690 --> 02:53:39,860
and then returning it and never playing it again.

3198
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:42,059
I just had no idea it was happening.

3199
02:53:42,059 --> 02:53:44,129
I did that a lot though.

3200
02:53:44,129 --> 02:53:46,920
I did that with tons of games,

3201
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:48,159
and it's kind of sad that I met,

3202
02:53:48,159 --> 02:53:51,530
I probably was just a little too,

3203
02:53:51,569 --> 02:53:53,450
I don't know, like ADHD and young,

3204
02:53:53,450 --> 02:53:54,569
kind of at the same time,

3205
02:53:54,569 --> 02:53:55,409
where it was just like,

3206
02:53:55,409 --> 02:53:56,729
oh, somebody already has a save file.

3207
02:53:56,729 --> 02:53:57,569
I don't wanna play that.

3208
02:53:57,569 --> 02:53:58,889
I just wanna see, they already did it.

3209
02:53:58,889 --> 02:53:59,899
I wanna do it.

3210
02:53:59,899 --> 02:54:01,739
And just don't understand what's going on.

3211
02:54:01,739 --> 02:54:07,059
I really wish I actually played through some of these,

3212
02:54:07,059 --> 02:54:09,659
because I feel like these are like

3213
02:54:09,659 --> 02:54:13,239
some of the most incredible old experiences,

3214
02:54:13,239 --> 02:54:17,290
and I just skipped all of it,

3215
02:54:17,290 --> 02:54:20,090
and just played on somebody else's save file for an hour,

3216
02:54:20,090 --> 02:54:22,129
and then it went back to the stores.

3217
02:54:22,129 --> 02:54:27,799
Hey Ralph, want my burger and fries?

3218
02:54:27,799 --> 02:54:29,159
You still do that.

3219
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:30,639
Dredging up on his bat cycle,

3220
02:54:30,639 --> 02:54:33,559
Batman races to the scene, surprising Ridman.

3221
02:54:33,559 --> 02:54:34,399
True.

3222
02:54:34,399 --> 02:54:38,549
Time's up, turbo jet Batman.

3223
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:46,659
These old Nickelodeon,

3224
02:54:46,659 --> 02:54:47,500
what are they called?

3225
02:54:47,500 --> 02:54:48,340
Bumps or whatever they're called?

3226
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:50,200
They were so good.

3227
02:54:50,200 --> 02:54:54,959
Stimpy and Snick will be back after these messages.

3228
02:54:54,959 --> 02:54:56,879
Nice, the Roundhouse takes on the Hulk.

3229
02:54:56,879 --> 02:54:57,719
I'm in the-

3230
02:54:57,719 --> 02:54:59,959
All right, we're going down to the final three.

3231
02:54:59,959 --> 02:55:00,799
Sorry.

3232
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:01,639
What?

3233
02:55:01,639 --> 02:55:02,479
Meet Lisa, I invited her for breakfast.

3234
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:03,719
I just heard the shark music.

3235
02:55:03,719 --> 02:55:05,639
Be central on Snick.

3236
02:55:06,479 --> 02:55:08,799
Hey squirt, meet Lisa, I invited her for breakfast.

3237
02:55:08,799 --> 02:55:09,639
Nice.

3238
02:55:09,639 --> 02:55:11,040
Can I have another bowl, Billy?

3239
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:11,879
Sure.

3240
02:55:11,879 --> 02:55:13,399
She's got my Kellogg's Corn Pops.

3241
02:55:13,399 --> 02:55:14,239
Stay calm.

3242
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,079
Sorry.

3243
02:55:16,079 --> 02:55:17,799
Sorry, you ate all my pops.

3244
02:55:17,799 --> 02:55:19,600
Oh, with that taste like sweet popcorn,

3245
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:21,120
and all you can say, Ms. Space Cadet,

3246
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:23,280
with my loser brother for her boyfriend is sorry?

3247
02:55:23,280 --> 02:55:24,840
What am I gonna do?

3248
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:28,000
Billy, didn't you have Megan over for her corn pops last week?

3249
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,280
Megan Keller, I'm not hungry.

3250
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:31,200
Aw.

3251
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:33,879
Kellogg's Corn Pops is part of this complete breakfast.

3252
02:55:33,879 --> 02:55:35,479
I gotta have my pops.

3253
02:55:35,479 --> 02:55:36,319
What?

3254
02:55:47,780 --> 02:55:52,889
That was an aggressive commercial there.

3255
02:55:52,889 --> 02:55:53,729
All right, we already saw the sponsor.

3256
02:55:53,729 --> 02:55:54,569
We got two more.

3257
02:55:56,559 --> 02:55:58,799
I went to look for the guys on foot that Saturday.

3258
02:55:58,799 --> 02:56:01,159
My old bike just didn't cut it anymore.

3259
02:56:01,159 --> 02:56:02,239
Nobody anywhere.

3260
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:06,899
I kept hearing this sound.

3261
02:56:06,899 --> 02:56:08,620
Moto Blaster?

3262
02:56:08,620 --> 02:56:13,170
Brother, the world was shut down.

3263
02:56:13,170 --> 02:56:14,690
Sorry, I don't know where they went.

3264
02:56:14,690 --> 02:56:15,930
Where was everybody?

3265
02:56:17,770 --> 02:56:19,610
Dad pulled in, then I saw him.

3266
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:26,770
This thing's awesome.

3267
02:56:26,770 --> 02:56:30,139
I don't remember that.

3268
02:56:30,139 --> 02:56:33,020
Here's one time, it doesn't matter who your neighbor is.

3269
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:39,280
Holy shit.

3270
02:56:47,659 --> 02:56:49,379
Here's the other.

3271
02:56:49,379 --> 02:56:51,959
Life's too short.

3272
02:56:51,959 --> 02:56:53,120
Stop the hate.

3273
02:56:58,079 --> 02:57:01,840
Announcing the Room Plus Triple Header Holiday Bonus.

3274
02:57:01,840 --> 02:57:05,600

02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:24,200
So hurry to Room Plus.

3282

Look at all these things.

3283
02:57:25,159 --> 02:57:26,399
Just round the corner.

3284
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:30,559
Watch.

3285
02:57:30,559 --> 02:57:31,840
To the glow of the Red Stimpy Show.

3286
02:57:31,840 --> 02:57:32,680
All right, last one.

3287
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:35,870
One more.

3288
02:57:35,870 --> 02:57:41,260
Now, stretch your vocal cords for the kind of caroling

3289
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:43,579
that could only occur at the Roundhouse,

3290
02:57:43,579 --> 02:57:46,379
as Snick takes you to the Roundhouse Holiday Bash.

3291
02:57:46,379 --> 02:57:47,219
Next.

3292
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:51,100
Belongs to Snick.

3293
02:57:51,100 --> 02:57:51,940
All right, last one.

3294
02:57:51,940 --> 02:57:54,299
When Snick brings you a special Doug Christmas.

3295
02:57:56,299 --> 02:57:57,139
I'll go to prison.

3296
02:57:57,139 --> 02:57:59,979
When Snick brings you a special Doug Christmas.

3297
02:57:59,979 --> 02:58:00,819
All right, last one.

3298
02:58:00,819 --> 02:58:03,100
Only on Nickelodeon.

3299
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:03,940
Triplets.

3300
02:58:03,940 --> 02:58:04,780
Cute.

3301
02:58:04,780 --> 02:58:10,989
I love my buss and giggle triplets.

3302
02:58:10,989 --> 02:58:12,670
What the fuck?

3303
02:58:12,670 --> 02:58:14,229
That was so scary.

3304
02:58:15,309 --> 02:58:16,469
That was terrifying.

3305
02:58:17,469 --> 02:58:18,670
That was so scary.

3306
02:58:24,430 --> 02:58:25,270
All right, that one didn't count.

3307
02:58:25,270 --> 02:58:26,270
We're gonna cut off.

3308
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:35,459
All right, this one doesn't count.

3309
02:58:35,459 --> 02:58:36,299
All right, no, we stopped.

3310
02:58:36,299 --> 02:58:38,219
I thought we stopped this one.

3311
02:58:38,219 --> 02:58:40,120
All right, here's the last one.

3312
02:58:49,209 --> 02:58:50,850
Flexor can do.

3313
02:58:50,850 --> 02:58:53,489
The spring-loaded fork handles the tough stuff.

3314
02:58:53,489 --> 02:58:54,889
No problem.

3315
02:58:54,889 --> 02:58:57,489
And the oversized tubing is made for rugged riding.

3316
02:58:59,969 --> 02:59:03,819
Yeah, he knew what my Murray Flexor could do.

3317
02:59:03,819 --> 02:59:04,979
But he does now.

3318
02:59:06,799 --> 02:59:09,879
Hey, hey, hey, Flexor by Murray.

3319
02:59:09,879 --> 02:59:11,719
All right, that was, that was, I like, that was fun.

3320
02:59:11,719 --> 02:59:13,200
How do you get the girls to come in?

3321
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:15,319
We're gonna have tons of refreshments.

3322
02:59:15,319 --> 02:59:17,239
Basically, this is trying to catch someone's eye, you know.

3323
02:59:17,239 --> 02:59:19,479
If you like a girl, you know, you invite her to a party.

3324
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:21,319
Yeah, we're ready.

3325
02:59:21,319 --> 02:59:22,879
This could be a lot of fun.

3326
02:59:22,879 --> 02:59:24,680
All the popular people are gonna be there.

3327
02:59:24,680 --> 02:59:25,760
PJ and Vogue.

3328
02:59:32,379 --> 02:59:34,020
Some people just wear, you know, regular clothes,

3329
02:59:34,020 --> 02:59:34,860
but since we've talked to them.

3330
02:59:34,860 --> 02:59:41,139
Have an awesome birthday party?

3331
02:59:41,139 --> 02:59:42,219
Who's Kirby?

3332
02:59:42,219 --> 02:59:43,059
What?

3333
02:59:43,059 --> 02:59:46,620
Behind the flabby facade, a physical powerhouse.

3334
02:59:46,620 --> 02:59:47,700
A street fighter.

3335
02:59:48,860 --> 02:59:50,579
A weapons expert.

3336
02:59:50,579 --> 02:59:51,620
Kirby was so cute.

3337
02:59:51,620 --> 02:59:53,459
Is whatever the situation demands.

3338
02:59:53,459 --> 02:59:54,299
Everybody loves Kirby.

3339
02:59:54,299 --> 02:59:55,340
In Kirby's adventure,

3340
02:59:55,379 --> 02:59:58,020
evil King Diddy stole in Dreamland's dreams.

3341
02:59:58,020 --> 03:00:00,139
Now Kirby's fighting to get him back.

3342
03:00:00,139 --> 03:00:02,260
Leveled by nightmarish level.

3343
03:00:02,260 --> 03:00:03,299
That's Kirby.

3344
03:00:03,299 --> 03:00:05,540
He's cute, till you cross him.

3345
03:00:05,540 --> 03:00:07,979
Then he's one tough cream puff.

3346
03:00:07,979 --> 03:00:10,659
Kirby's Adventure on NES.

3347
03:00:10,659 --> 03:00:12,659
All right, I think that's a good one going on.

3348
03:00:15,059 --> 03:00:16,500
Flameless, I was only gonna stream

3349
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:17,620
for like three hours or so.

3350
03:00:17,620 --> 03:00:22,819
And there's only so many ads I can take in a row.

3351
03:00:22,819 --> 03:00:38,239
You walk like Kirby?

3352
03:00:38,239 --> 03:00:40,620
Oh, the carrot, that's right.

3353
03:00:40,620 --> 03:00:44,500
I forgot about the carrot.

3354
03:00:45,219 --> 03:00:50,790
It's time to give Otto a carrot before I leave.

3355
03:00:50,790 --> 03:00:52,639
All right, I'll be right back.

3356
03:00:52,639 --> 03:00:54,780
If you want to see Otto get a carrot,

3357
03:00:54,780 --> 03:02:11,280
you'll have to stay tuned for only another minute.

3358
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:17,569
Okay, he's ready for his carrot.

3359
03:02:17,569 --> 03:02:19,579
You want a carrot?

3360
03:02:19,579 --> 03:02:26,479
Wait, you're gonna be able to see it.

3361
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:35,309
All right, you want a carrot?

3362
03:02:35,309 --> 03:02:38,059
You want this?

3363
03:02:38,059 --> 03:02:39,139
Go eat a carrot.

3364
03:02:43,059 --> 03:02:45,489
Ready?

3365
03:02:45,489 --> 03:02:50,920
Good dog.

3366
03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:55,659
Crunchy carrot.

3367
03:02:55,659 --> 03:02:58,590
I don't think you can hear the crunching, but he is.

3368
03:02:58,590 --> 03:03:04,610
It's pretty loud.

3369
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:05,450
There it is.

3370
03:03:05,450 --> 03:03:10,819
Good job, Otto.

3371
03:03:10,819 --> 03:03:12,020
He's kind of like, where are you going?

3372
03:03:12,020 --> 03:03:15,250
I want another one.

3373
03:03:17,379 --> 03:03:21,129
All right, let me let him out.

3374
03:03:21,129 --> 03:03:22,290
He's like, he's looking for more.

3375
03:03:22,290 --> 03:03:23,690
He's like, where are they?

3376
03:03:23,690 --> 03:03:29,229
He's like, there has to be more than one.

3377
03:03:29,229 --> 03:03:58,430
All right, I'll be right back.

3378
03:03:58,430 --> 03:04:06,420
All righty, this is the only Otto moment of the year.

3379
03:04:06,420 --> 03:04:09,790
Well, so far.

3380
03:04:09,790 --> 03:04:20,100
All right, everybody, I will see you guys tomorrow.

3381
03:04:20,100 --> 03:04:24,409
We're gonna continue and play House Flipper.

3382
03:04:24,409 --> 03:04:26,290
There's a big update for it.

3383
03:04:26,290 --> 03:04:28,319
Thanks for watching.

3384
03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:30,639
Short stream today, but I kind of just wanted to do this.

3385
03:04:30,639 --> 03:04:33,780
Wanted to show the Grotto Beast ad

3386
03:04:33,780 --> 03:04:38,100
and watch these commercials.

3387
03:04:38,100 --> 03:04:39,700
Tomorrow, I'm gonna start probably the normal time,

3388
03:04:39,700 --> 03:04:44,629
probably six o'clock Pacific.

3389
03:04:45,629 --> 03:04:51,559
That sounds like a plan to me.

3390
03:04:51,559 --> 03:04:53,020
Take care of yourselves.

3391
03:04:53,020 --> 03:04:53,860
Thanks for watching.

3392
03:04:53,860 --> 03:04:56,709
If you are there tomorrow, we'll see you tomorrow.

3393
03:04:56,709 --> 03:05:01,059
And then I think mid-week, next week,

3394
03:05:01,059 --> 03:05:07,250
I think Ster and I are gonna play some games.

3395
03:05:07,250 --> 03:05:10,489
So I probably am only gonna stream,

3396
03:05:10,489 --> 03:05:13,090
I wanna say maybe once or twice next week.

3397
03:05:15,639 --> 03:05:20,459
I think Holly and I are gonna take a break.

3398
03:05:20,459 --> 03:05:23,860
I feel like we've been kind of running around like crazy.

3399
03:05:23,860 --> 03:05:26,860
So I think we wanna take a break,

3400
03:05:26,860 --> 03:05:28,139
but I'll be live next week.

3401
03:05:28,139 --> 03:05:31,350
I'll be live once or twice.

3402
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:34,110
I wasn't streaming for the last four or five straight days,

3403
03:05:35,129 --> 03:05:38,430
but we were kind of making sure a lot of things went smoothly,

3404
03:05:38,430 --> 03:05:42,100
especially for the Grotto Beast stuff.

3405
03:05:42,100 --> 03:05:43,780
And we are still actively working on it.

3406
03:05:43,780 --> 03:05:46,079
So that is still actively a project

3407
03:05:46,079 --> 03:05:50,940
that is being worked on every day.

3408
03:05:50,940 --> 03:05:52,700
But it's gonna be literally,

3409
03:05:52,700 --> 03:05:57,280
I'll be live probably Wednesday and maybe on the weekend.

3410
03:05:57,280 --> 03:05:58,809
We'll see.

3411
03:05:58,809 --> 03:06:11,219
The music, why am I so bad at this?

3412
03:06:11,219 --> 03:06:12,780
You know what, it's because I moved it.

3413
03:06:12,780 --> 03:06:15,100
I moved the audio.

3414
03:06:15,100 --> 03:06:22,659
Hold on, where did I move it to?

3415
03:06:22,659 --> 03:06:25,030
Where did I move it to?

3416
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:32,000
It's in a folder here somewhere.

3417
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:36,319
No, where is it?

3418
03:06:36,319 --> 03:06:38,459
No.

3419
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:43,469
I'll find it for tomorrow.

3420
03:06:43,469 --> 03:06:47,500
I put it in some folder.

3421
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:49,260
But yeah, take care of yourselves.

3422
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:53,549
Have a good night, see you tomorrow.

3423
03:06:53,549 --> 03:06:57,780
Thanks for watching.

3424
03:06:57,780 --> 03:07:02,270
Call your mother, you know what to do.

3425
03:07:02,270 --> 03:07:12,100
That was the fourth auto moment this year, was it really?

3426
03:07:12,100 --> 03:07:21,840
Well, maybe one or two, I don't remember.

3427
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:24,540
Ow, my finger.

3428
03:07:24,540 --> 03:07:27,440
I just like crunched it.

3429
03:07:27,440 --> 03:07:33,430
Sorry about that.

3430
03:07:33,430 --> 03:07:36,190
I just thought of the guy's toe coming through the sock

3431
03:07:36,190 --> 03:07:45,540
with that sound effect.

3432
03:07:45,540 --> 03:07:49,129
All right, see you guys later, take care.

3433
03:07:49,129 --> 03:07:49,969
See you tomorrow.
