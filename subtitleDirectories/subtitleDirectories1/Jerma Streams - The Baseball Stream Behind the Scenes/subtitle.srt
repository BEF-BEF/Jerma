00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:11,099
Hello, how you doing? Welcome back. It's been about a week.

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,699
It's been almost exactly one full week since the stream was last live.

3
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:23,129
There's a lot to talk about. There's quite a few things to discuss.

4
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:29,370
Hope you had a good time on that show. It was uh, it was a ton of fun to do.

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:35,829
And before we get started, just right off the bat, every time there's a show that

6
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,710
happens, every time, oh I'm gonna do this big thing, whatever, and

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,850
get a bunch of people together and do a bunch of stuff. I almost get that,

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,609
like, it's over. No! It can't be, right? Like, we're gonna do another, we gotta

9
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,539
do like five more games. It's just, right? It's just like, oh that

10
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,810
was awesome! I had so much fun! Oh well, on to the next one, right?

11
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,729
Uh, so I'm in, I'm in one of those places right now where it's like, wow that was

12
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:04,549
so much fucking fun! God, all right, well that was cool. We'll

13
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:12,140
do another one. We'll do another one at some point.

14
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,250
But yeah, no, it was a ton of fun. I had a blast. Hopefully everybody else did too.

15
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,459
We had some technical problems in the middle of the stream, which

16
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:28,760
weirdly enough, when we changed Twitch ingest servers, it fixed it.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,260
Something about the encoder, I have no idea. We'll have to figure that out.

18
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,530
And speaking of internet problems and streaming to Twitch right now,

19
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:53,209
apparently I'm dropping more frames. Why? I don't know. I wish I could tell you.

20
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,890
Well hey, but whoa, we got a really important first question. Do you still

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:06,409
have the mustache? Well, you're gonna have to find out.

22
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:14,199
You'll have to find out very soon. But speaking of ingest servers, do I need to

23
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:19,050
change now before I really get started? Because

24
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,419
it's not looking great. It's not looking great right now.

25
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:34,120
I mustached you a question. As a non-American, I don't know baseball, so I

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:46,199
was kind of lost. Well, I kind of figured that was gonna happen.

27
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,780
I might just restart the stream really quickly and change server.

28
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Why do I have to keep doing this? I feel like I'm playing

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,379
Whack-a-mole with Twitch ingest servers lately.

30
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:14,060
What is going on here? That's what it feels like. I'll give it another five

31
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,740
seconds. Five minutes. He's leaving already.

32
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,639
No, I just said I have to go and play, I have to go play hopscotch

33
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,650
to four or five different servers until I don't drop frames anymore.

34
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,639
What is going on Twitch? What is happening here?

35
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,960
This is a new problem over the last like four to five months.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:50,629
I don't get it. But anyways, yeah, it was a fantastic time.

37
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,590
Forget about the... I'm so glad that the first

38
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,500
three or four innings were fine and then we had that...

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,650
You should have seen what was going on up in the production truck.

40
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,240
Community Jake was assembling a new computer.

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,159
He was literally making a new computer. He was building a computer

42
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,840
up there because he was like, is it the video processor? Because we had three or

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,879
four straight innings. It was fine. It was the stream was perfect. No

44
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,220
problems at all. And then all of a sudden it was just like, what's going on?

45
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,420
So he built a whole computer up there and he's...

46
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,819
Apparently he switched ingest servers and fixed it.

47
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,300
But I mean, I'm just happy it was only for like an inning and a half

48
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,860
and not the whole thing. We have something really cool here.

49
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,560
So as I'm going to just kind of talk about the day, talk about kind of leading

50
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
up to it and everything. I'll look at... I'll answer pretty much any questions you

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,560
guys have and we'll go from here. But there are about 300 photos

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,360
that are going to be in a slideshow behind the scenes.

53
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,220
ResidentMod LeatherJacket took these photos.

54
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,220
It was really cool. And all right, I'm going to answer the burning question.

55
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,629
I'll answer. It's time to answer. Do you still have the mustache?

56
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:19,160
What do you think? Place your bets. Do you think it's still there? Is it still

57
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:31,350
there? What do you think? Let's take a vote. Let's take a vote. Yeah,

58
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,670
take a vote. Run a poll here. Do I still... I'm curious how many people think

59
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,269
no or yes. Let us gamble. Well, not gamble, but just like...

60
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:50,819
Do you think it's still there? All right, I'll run a poll. Okay, here we go.

61
00:05:50,819 --> 00:06:02,389
Do you think it's still... Okay, yeah, you got it. Do you think I still have it?

62
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:07,769
Were you wearing ass paddings? No, that's my real ass.

63
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:14,870
Why would I... Okay, why would I put in ass paddings? Why would I do that?

64
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,850
That would be so strange. You know, being in the umpire gear in the first

65
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,699
place, having like the turtle armor on underneath is already kind of

66
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,009
enough. I had these huge leg pads that I was supposed to wear and I was like,

67
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:39,029
no, no thanks. No, thank you. It was just too bulky.

68
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,750
I did have a cup on though, so all the people that were saying,

69
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,029
holy shit dude, you are so lucky. What if you took one right into the balls?

70
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:50,420
I was wearing a cup. There's a clip circulating around

71
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,100
of me whacking myself with a bat in the balls. Yeah, I'm fine.

72
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,459
I had a cup on. I don't recommend you do that at home. Don't try that at home,

73
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:03,769
obviously. No, it's that you didn't. Why would I...

74
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:08,569
That's one thing I'm gonna protect, okay? What I told

75
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:13,689
everybody that was in production, I said make sure my face is good

76
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,250
and make sure my balls are good. Well, I didn't say that to them, but like I was

77
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,490
thinking that. Like, I don't care about anything else.

78
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,720
I could take a ball to the... I could take a ball to like the arm.

79
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,720
I could take a ball to the to the knee, to the chest, to the back.

80
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,430
I don't care. The face? You re-protect that.

81
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,029
And the balls? We protect those too, right? Like, I protect those.

82
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,550
That's it. Balls and face. That's all I care about. That's it.

83
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:48,009
And I had them protected. Anyways, all right, it's time to reveal.

84
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,610
Like, this is a big deal or not, but a lot of you think I still have it.

85
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,569
And you are absolutely incorrect. It's still there.

86
00:07:54,569 --> 00:08:11,050
It's not as dark, I guess. It's still there! What if that was pre-recorded?

87
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:19,750
Could've been. All right, I'll play the real video now. It's still there.

88
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,709
So, there's gonna be kind of a little bit of a reveal here.

89
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:31,129
It's gonna be a little bit of a reveal. Yes, I had a mustache during this show

90
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:33,769
because I wanted one so that would be fun and interesting and funny.

91
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:38,919
Oh, he's got a big mustache. He's the mustache guy.

92
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,110
It was filled in. It was filled in. The makeup artist filled it in so it was darker.

93
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,090
I can't actually grow a real mustache like that. This is what it looks like. It's filled in.

94
00:08:50,090 --> 00:09:03,240
Should I keep it? I don't think I can keep it. I really don't think so. Don't keep it.

95
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,360
But yeah, so this is... I'm just gonna let this slideshow play and we'll talk.

96
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,500
If I see something interesting to bring up, I think it'd be fun to talk about,

97
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,500
but I can't stress this enough. So anytime that a show like this happens,

98
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,029
where you're bringing in a bunch of people that don't understand Twitch and streaming culture,

99
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,500
so a lot of them did, but a lot of them didn't.

100
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,379
And trying to explain to people like, hey, we're doing this live thing.

101
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,850
This is what's gonna happen. This is what we're doing.

102
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:39,899
And from top to bottom of the order here, every performer, every player,

103
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:48,649
all the broadcasters in the broadcast booth, oh my God, they fucking killed it.

104
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,080
It didn't matter what position you were in. They were unfucking believable.

105
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:01,080
They were so funny and they were so good. I mean, yeah, there was obviously weeks of

106
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,960
preparation and we spent a few days talking to everybody and there was obviously a lot

107
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:12,950
of direction, right? But still, that was a lot of fun. That was absolutely a huge blast.

108
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,500
And I'm so happy that everybody had a great time and everybody did have a great time.

109
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,029
So I'd stamp it as that was a success. I mean, would I have liked to have had the

110
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,629
stream not turn off three or four times? Absolutely. And that's very frustrating.

111
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:31,450
But you have to take that out of the equation when everybody had so much fun.

112
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,730
I had the time of my life calling balls and strikes and just running around.

113
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,240
At the end of the day, I think it was a monumental success.

114
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,559
And I'm incredibly proud and happy of the entire team and every player, all the coaches,

115
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:51,460
the two coaches. They weren't baseball coaches. Those were actors.

116
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,779
We actually told, actually, why am I not letting this play? This has to play. All right, start

117
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:03,700
playing. So we told the coaches, hey, you're going to be a baseball coach. And they're like,

118
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:11,429
oh, that's really, really cool. That's awesome. I know a little bit about baseball, but not

119
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:17,379
really that much about baseball. Were they real teams? Yes, those were real players.

120
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:24,139
Ranging from college players to some of them saw some professional baseballs. I mean,

121
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:32,950
those were real players. Those weren't actors. It's going too fast. Hey, I'll pause. I'll pause

122
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:42,919
every so often. Here you go. I can hear the mustache move. And yeah, that Fansley with

123
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,179
the striker, I thought that was really funny. I thought that was really funny. And Fansley really

124
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:55,210
came through hard. Fansley was a huge supporter of the stream. And I got to make it clear to

125
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,539
everybody, stuff like this can't happen without support like that. It just can't.

126
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,809
The price tags on some of these shows, I don't really need to talk about them,

127
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:12,870
but they're astronomical sometimes. So I'm grateful and happy that sponsors actually

128
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:20,840
wanted to come through and do some of this stuff. It's not that it's hard to sell a show like this

129
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,559
to sponsors, but at the end of the day, it's like, oh yeah, we're going to do the circus

130
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,720
and magicians baseball show where I'm like an umpire. I don't know umpiring. I don't know

131
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,769
anything about that. I mean, I watched baseball when I was 17. It's like, oh, how much money is

132
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:43,220
this show? I get it. I do. But at the end of the day, we get support from the places we get them.

133
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:56,409
And it was awesome. I thought it flowed really well. Yeah. And everybody at Car Shield Field

134
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:01,860
in St. Louis, they were fantastic. They were so much fun to work with. They were so awesome.

135
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,750
Like I said, from top to bottom doesn't matter. Even the food, the delivery and stuff,

136
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,860
everything was just on point. Everything was perfect. It doesn't matter if you were

137
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,340
you know, a principal player or somebody on production or somebody that was

138
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:21,340
working behind the scenes of behind the scenes. Everybody doesn't matter who it was.

139
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:31,860
Why are you so red? Oh, because I have the action movie filter on from like two weeks ago.

140
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:39,210
Shave or I'm going to unsub. How about you relax? Look, you, you can, how about you,

141
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,539
you can unsub if you feel like it. You don't have to because I have a fucking gross mustache.

142
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:52,120
They're just making fucking deals. You know what I mean? There he is just making deals on the phone.

143
00:13:52,120 --> 00:14:00,889
No, I was actually talking about it. I was talking to Holly. I love the mustache. It does look good.

144
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:11,059
There you go. Wait, wait, let's go back, back, back, back. So everybody, everybody that was on

145
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:17,659
the performance group, this is a bunch of performers. So people didn't realize that we,

146
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:25,899
it was not just baseball players. It was baseball players and it was like real circus performers

147
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:33,659
blended in. A lot of these guys did not see a single, a single time in the field. They

148
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:44,899
did not see a single ball. There were, I want to say we had 25 baseball players and like 12

149
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,710
performers. Like, like if, no, they were, they were 12 like circus type performers,

150
00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:01,129
25 baseball players, five other actors. So yeah, there was a lot of moving parts here.

151
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:07,259
So anytime you saw something really interesting, like circus wise or some magic tricks or whatever,

152
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:14,919
that was not a baseball player and it flowed really, really well. Like I said,

153
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:20,299
who were the commentators? They were the best part of the whole show. Yeah, they were unbelievable.

154
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:26,779
And that, let me just go, they did all that based on, so I want to say probably like an hour or two,

155
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:34,779
an hour or two before the show is when I sat down with those two and really was like,

156
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,019
this is kind of what I'm looking for. This is kind of what the world that is here. This is the kind

157
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:41,899
of universe and here's what we're going to do. Here's what we're going to do. This is what you

158
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,360
guys should talk about. This is what you shouldn't talk about. They got maybe one hour of direction,

159
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:55,100
two hours of direction, and they carried that whole entire broadcast. They, were they confused?

160
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:03,269
No, no, they were on point. They were ready to go. They knew everything to say. Absolute kings. Oh

161
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:15,320
yeah. There was a lot of sexual innuendo. Well, you understand that we had a streaker with a

162
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:23,000
fansly integration. By the way, I need to confirm something right now. Very important,

163
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,110
most important time, most important thing of the entire show. You might have seen it on Twitter.

164
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,539
You might have seen it posted somewhere and you may cannot confirm that that's true.

165
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:42,100
Paul Fondler has officially been unbanned. They are officially not banned from the channel.

166
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:51,659
They can post freely. Probably just going to get banned again, if I'm honest. I mean that, look,

167
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,019
when you get the get out of jail free card in Monopoly, that, you know, you can get out of jail

168
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:02,779
free, but that doesn't mean you can't go back to jail. It's not a get out of jail forever. So,

169
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:13,930
you could just go right back. People, oh wait, somebody, oh wait, people whooing Paul Fondler?

170
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:23,880
We're getting people actually, oh Megalel, whooing Paul Fondler. I'm, I can't believe that. I'm

171
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:33,210
actually surprised. Yeah, they were practicing juggling and stuff. Did you see the fire breather?

172
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:49,000
The fire breathing was fucking insane. Yeah, there was a lot of, and people were asking about

173
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,000
who were the people in the audience. So, we didn't, obviously, right, very obviously,

174
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,690
we didn't want people to know kind of immediately where we were for very obvious reasons, right?

175
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:08,660
It's just like, wait a minute, I live right down the street from Car Shield Field. Let's go. And

176
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,380
we obviously, it's, we're doing a show and we didn't want somebody to, like, you know, come on in and

177
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,299
be like, yeah, let's sit down. And they throw a fucking large soda onto the field and then,

178
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,609
you know, run. We didn't, obviously, want, didn't have that to happen. We had security at the event.

179
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:26,259
There was, we had private security there. So, I mean, they were obviously handling anything

180
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:32,900
that would come about. But they were, like, just random, I guess, kind of friends and family members

181
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,259
of whoever was there, whoever we kind of cleared to be there, I guess you'd say. So, that people

182
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,460
were wondering, like, who the fuck are these people in the audience? Like, how did they get there? Why

183
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:48,440
are they here? It's because they were, like, a private invite from one of the players or one

184
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,789
of the performers or whatever. They were, like, friends and family. That's what I figured, yeah.

185
00:18:52,789 --> 00:19:03,460
So, that was fun. It was cool. Doing an event like this with an actual live audience would need a lot

186
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:13,180
more control of, I guess, the environment, not this community, Jake. You'll see in a few minutes

187
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,630
the amount of times that I, this, me and Jake had this, like, because I was down here and he was up

188
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,700
here. The amount of times that in between innings we both, like, came running down to each other,

189
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,900
like, to this weird cage that we were both separated by, was just like, hey, so what's going on? How

190
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,819
are we doing up there? How are we doing? Do you need anything down here? Yeah, yeah, no, I need

191
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:37,299
more balls to be supplemented down here. How's the video going in the truck? Like, we literally just

192
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:43,910
came down to, like, the blockage and then, like, and then turned around and ran. That happened to

193
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,710
almost every single in-between inning. Somebody said, I tried to get in, but I was denied. Well,

194
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:58,119
yeah, dude, like, what do you want me to say? You can't just, we can't just have anybody just come,

195
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,539
just come into the, just show up and run on the field. We already had a streaker. I don't need two.

196
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:11,769
There's the performers practicing again. And, yeah, some of the, my favorite shots of this whole thing

197
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:17,369
were when it would just randomly cut to one of the performers just standing on a ball in the outfield,

198
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:24,500
just standing there, just kind of, like, going, balancing on it on, like, the unicycles.

199
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:32,900
It was so funny, like, just randomly, like, why would you be back there doing that? Like,

200
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,299
that laptop, that was, like, glued to his hand the whole day. Of course, they had to have been,

201
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,440
right? So, this is, we were going over that. So, obviously, I don't want to break anybody's

202
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,019
immersion here, but we're going to. We're watching back the pre-recorded segment at the end of the

203
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:58,630
show, which those guys were so good, too. Like, those sports analyst guys at the desk, everybody

204
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:04,039
was so good. It was so fun. It wasn't live. Well, it wasn't live. Of course, it was a pre-recorded

205
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:10,630
show. That wasn't, the mime game wasn't currently a live broadcast. It was from the previous earlier

206
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:22,940
in the day or earlier in the week. The stream was fake. No, it was real. It was real enough.

207
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,680
But yeah, we were watching it back earlier in the day to make sure, like, okay, is it, like,

208
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:35,670
ready to go? It's ready to go. Yeah, we have, like, I think the best part. Oh, this is the makeup.

209
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:42,980
Yeah. You wouldn't believe how long it takes. It takes a long time to paint, like, 20 people's

210
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:50,950
faces in clown makeup. It actually takes a fairly long time. So, we had, like, two or three makeup

211
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,950
artists just cycling people in, all right, your turn, your turn, your turn. It took about, like,

212
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:07,990
two or three hours to do all this. Just wait till, just wait till I sit down and you see them fill

213
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:17,380
in my mustache. It was embarrassing. Do you still like balloons? Like, balloons tower defense? All

214
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,859
right, so this is, this is before the show. This is where we're just kind of preparing, because

215
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,240
this is the first time we had really everybody together, which you can't see over here, but

216
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,019
there's another probably 50 people sitting or 60 people or whatever total sitting in these seats.

217
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:34,920
And we were just kind of doing a full kind of production meeting. Okay, here we go. Let's do it.

218
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,759
And I hadn't eaten pretty much all day because I'm obviously just running around like crazy.

219
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:42,680
So, you're going to see a bunch of footage of me with this same salad in my hand for, like,

220
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,500
two to three hours. I don't know how many pictures there are of this, but it's a solid probably

221
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,819
two to three hours I was walking around with this. Because, you know, I'm just like, I'm just eating,

222
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:58,710
you know? There's no time to eat, right? There isn't. Anybody that's ever, like some of you guys

223
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,190
that know this, when you're like working on something and you're really in the zone and you

224
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,750
don't, you don't want to take any breaks, you're just, I'm ready to fucking go. Let's go, right?

225
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,750
Eating food sometimes is impossible because it's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta

226
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,400
eat food. No, that's gonna take like 30 minutes. I don't have time. Nope. No, no time for that.

227
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,059
I'll do it later. I'll eat later. So this is the, I'll eat later. This is probably, I want to say,

228
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:30,359
maybe an hour and 10 minutes before the show. So I'm just kind of like, well, maybe like two hours

229
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:35,099
or so. I'm just like walking around with like the salad. Like, yeah, okay, no, no, that looks good.

230
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:39,019
That looks good. We need you over here. Like just shoveling salad in my mouth. Salad's really easy

231
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,299
to eat on the go because it doesn't, here's the thing about a salad and those of you that are like

232
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:49,180
work kind of like on location and shit, like a chicken on salad, just like, you know, strips of

233
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:55,700
chicken with a salad cold as fuck. Cold. You can walk around with that for an hour or two. It's not

234
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:04,470
like, oh, no, no, no, I have to eat this hot sandwich or this hot bowl of, you know, quinoa

235
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:11,420
and like meat and shit. No, dude, if you're ever on the go like that, get yourself like a barbecue

236
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,440
chicken salad, a lot of greens in there, and you can walk around and eat that for two hours,

237
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:25,660
like I did. Yeah, and I presented with it. Looking back at this, this looks fucking weird now that

238
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm like seeing this. This looks very strange. This looks like, why am I, this is actually kind

239
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,299
of strange when I'm thinking, when I'm looking back at this, me like, oh, like, okay, here's,

240
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:42,579
let's talk. All right, so I don't really like, let me explain. I don't really like dressing on

241
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:51,220
salads. I think it like kind of ruins the salad. It turns it into this weird mush. So I don't

242
00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:02,279
usually use the salad dressing. So I like, I usually don't open the cup and when they put the cups in

243
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:13,509
there, it's like, sometimes I just leave them in just in case. What about croutons? Croutons are

244
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:21,880
fine. Yeah, we still drop. Yeah, we are. I don't get it. I don't get it. You know, I got to talk

245
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,940
to somebody at like Twitch, at like data or something, because I can't, I don't have any

246
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,259
idea what's going on. It doesn't make any sense. Across the board, like, they just hate, like,

247
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:39,000
they just hate the traffic that's coming from my channels. They just hate it. I don't get it.

248
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,869
I literally have ran speed tests, like upload, to upload servers for like 12 straight hours,

249
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:53,380
and it's a thousand, a thousand clean every time. It doesn't, I don't understand. I don't get it.

250
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,779
I have to like jump, jump, server, server, server switch, server switch, server switch, server switch,

251
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:05,079
server switch. All right, I got one. This one works. Conspiracy Andy. I'm just, I'm not saying

252
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:10,200
it's a conspiracy. I'm just saying like over the last six months, my traffic has been perfect on

253
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:18,170
my end, but some route that it takes to Twitch, it hates it. It hates me. It's not just you.

254
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:29,269
What the heck? Anyways, so get a big salad, and I'm not a conspiracy, that's not a conspiracy.

255
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:35,640
I mean, look, I'm dropping frames. All right, let's skip the like me eating food stuff. All right,

256
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,109
so yeah, we had everybody kind of lined up here, just hearing all the, you know what the best part

257
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:57,829
is? Hold on a minute. It's in character. Like the sad crying clown. These guys were amazing.

258
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:04,359
And also doing, okay, so this is a very serious meeting, and there's something about a very

259
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,900
serious meeting. Okay, guys, we're about two hours away from the show. My name's,

260
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,819
my name's German985. I know I've talked to you guys a lot over the last few weeks,

261
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:19,049
but here we are. Kind of like a, let's go kind of, let's talk session. And,

262
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:53,819
do I change to the Mexico server again? That's what fixed it the last time. Should I stream to

263
00:27:53,819 --> 00:28:06,230
the Mexico Twitch server? Is that what I have to do again? He's fuming. Oh, I am fuming. This is,

264
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,589
fume. Why is he so red? Do you understand how much my, how hot my blood is? It's like 110 degrees.

265
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:22,279
But anyways, whatever. I was going to deal with it before we play, because this is like static

266
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:28,660
imagery. It's fine. Before I play in the game today, I'll switch. I can, I don't fucking understand.

267
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:38,809
I don't get it. All right. Anyways, let's go. So yeah. And, but what I was saying was doing a big

268
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:45,529
meeting with your, I'm standing down here, like here, like off camera, looking up and describing

269
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:50,089
to people. Okay. So then, by the way, when the streaker comes out, what we're going to have to

270
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:54,650
do is everyone's going to still continue playing and this guy's going to get naked. And you're

271
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,289
looking at a bunch of clown faces and a bunch of people that are just like, okay. It's just like,

272
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:05,579
what the fuck's happening? This is weird. This is a very strange conversation. But I live for that

273
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:14,819
shit though. This is like one of my favorite parts of every show is this. Like we're all actually

274
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:20,329
here and we're all actually going to do this is if some of my favorite part of an any show.

275
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:32,250
Is the mustache real? Well, you'll see. You'll see. It was real enough. Did I get to the end

276
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,930
of the salad? No, there's still some bread in there. Was there bread in it? I don't even remember.

277
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:47,700
Whatever is in here. It looks gross, but you have to just like kind of mix it together or whatever.

278
00:29:47,700 --> 00:30:03,589
All right. It was, it was, I better not have any more fucking food in any of these photos.

279
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:15,319
Oh, that's so fucking funny. Yeah. So from up here, this is, yeah, this is me getting into my

280
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:22,869
people, people. I mean, umpire gear. Everyone's like, what is he fucking stupid? Why is he wearing

281
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:29,750
his umpire gear under his clothes? What is he dumb? He's a, he's a child. That's what you do.

282
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:36,619
You don't wear it over the clothes. It's, I'm not a, I'm not a, like you wear the armor under the

283
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:42,039
clothes. You wear your football pad. They don't wear the football pads over the jerseys. No,

284
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:52,309
you wear everything under the clothes. Why do I look so, what am I doing? Yeah. People are like,

285
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:56,789
oh yeah, dude. Like, I can't believe he's so dumb. He's wearing the armor under the clothes.

286
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:15,799
Yeah. That's how, where it goes. It's a bulletproof vest. It's why he's so red. I don't know, man.

287
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:25,400
Okay. So this is where I was getting my fake mustache filled in. Oh yeah. I kicked, I had to

288
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,099
kick this guy out. I felt really bad because I had to be done because they had to mic me up

289
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,539
and I had to get into the production truck and be like, okay, cause this is, this is like 25

290
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:39,349
minutes before the show, 30 minutes before the show. And I had to kick this guy out of the chair.

291
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:45,049
So if you're wondering why he's, he's got this ring is because it's like, I gotta get my mustache

292
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:51,529
done. I gotta get my mustache done and I've got to sit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. He's like, no,

293
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:56,970
no, no, I get it. I get it. So I sit down and I must look like such a weirdo. Like, so this guy's

294
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,819
about to get his face filled in with clown makeup and he has to move because this ego maniac wants

295
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:08,200
to make sure his mustache looks good filled in for the camera. This is not a requirement. This is.

296
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:17,430
This was not necessary. This was. So I kind of just was like, I need my, I gotta get my mustache

297
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:33,990
filled in. I have to get it filled in. Everyone's just like waiting their turn. It was disgusting

298
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:40,359
too. I looked so, yeah, look at how gross that is. It looks like there are wires coming out of my

299
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:48,569
over here. I can't grow a mustache. I really can't. Oh, by the way, this is when I was tweeting the

300
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:56,869
go live tweet. I forgot. I was like, oh shit, I've got a tweet. I've got a tweet right now.

301
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:03,160
So this is it. This is like 10 minutes before the show. I was like, crafting, crafting. Okay,

302
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,480
how do I say that? Okay, no, no, like we got, we got coffee. Okay, good. How does it look? Good.

303
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:14,470
Yeah, I'm not even paying attention to anything that's going on. I'm sunburned. I'm not sunburned.

304
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:24,859
I have a stupid filter on. I'm turning it off. There. I don't know why that was even on in the

305
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:32,710
first place. It looked stupid. The stilt walkers were amazing. You're in, you're on, you're browsing

306
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:53,690
your iPad, kid. You're playing an iPad game. This shirt. I'm not sunburned. This was great,

307
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,690
too. The funny part is, oh, hold on, I'll go back. So he was just kind of chilling in the outfield

308
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:10,519
for a long time. When we would come back to, there are tons of clips of him just standing

309
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:16,949
menacingly kind of over the fence in right field. He kind of hung out there for a couple of innings.

310
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,539
He was there for like two innings. So that you'd see like a ball would go over there or like in

311
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,320
the beginning of the show, he's just kind of in the right field is hanging out, just kind of

312
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,869
standing around, like looking around. He was awesome. The stilt walkers were fantastic.

313
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:43,719
I love these mascot outfits, too. They're so, and the names of the mascots, I, okay, people are

314
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:50,489
wondering, oh, what were the names of the mascots? I never told the broadcasters what the names of

315
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:57,610
the mascots were. So they actually had names. Their names were, it was supposed to be Presto

316
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:03,400
Magesto was the magician, but they called him Dumbledore and it just made it, it was just better.

317
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:11,340
They kept calling him Dumbledore. I just never told them their names. I just kind of forgot to.

318
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,400
It's just one of the things that just fell out. Yeah, it was Presto Magesto, Presto Magesto and

319
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:29,780
Kooky the Clown. I have, what were they calling the clown? It's Dumbledore. What would they call,

320
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,320
what were they saying the clown's name was? Maybe they didn't. They would just say the clown. They

321
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:52,219
called him the clown. He was great, too, the ball boy. They called, they were called the clown,

322
00:35:52,219 --> 00:36:02,440
yeah. So another thing that is important for you guys to understand, the reason why we had so many

323
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:09,349
balls come out and in, don't tell anybody. Don't want, this is a secret. So obviously we had some

324
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:16,550
dangerous shit that we were doing and when you have three pitchers on the mound and a guy with

325
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,969
like three bats in his hand or somebody that can't see out of a mascot costume pitching to people,

326
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:32,869
you got to be careful and we, what we did was we used real baseballs and tea balls,

327
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,880
like little league tea balls. So anytime somebody was going to get thrown at or anytime there was

328
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,079
going to be, okay, we got, there's a guy in a, in a mascot costume. He might take a baseball to the

329
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,460
fucking face. He might take a baseball to like anywhere because they were, they were not protected.

330
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,860
The people in the mascot outfits were not wearing fin guards and cups and they were,

331
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,760
they were in mascot outfits. So we were using tea balls and it's a good thing we were because

332
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,639
people were just kind of sliding around, throwing them at each other, hitting each other with them

333
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:10,340
and stuff. So we, we had tea balls. When we were doing the actual baseball routines, just we were

334
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,400
playing the game, we were using the real balls. So yeah, come on, you know, you don't think I was

335
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:25,860
thinking of this? You don't think I thought of that? What's a tea ball? A tea ball is designed,

336
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:32,260
it's a softer baseball and it's designed for little kids to put on a tee. So there's no

337
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,500
pitching in tea ball. It sits on a tee. It's like a stand that stands up and you put the ball on it

338
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:44,469
and the kids just whack it, right? So these things are very soft because kids are not very smart and

339
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:50,150
they're not very coordinated. So a tee ball getting like hit in the chest or something from some kid

340
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:58,949
is not a baseball and it would be, you know, obviously less potential harm. Safety, Andy.

341
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:06,329
Yeah, yeah. Look, there's not a scenario where I'm going to have the mascot pitch a real baseball

342
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:14,809
to one of these, these high level athletes that hit a line drive directly into the mascot's balls

343
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:26,070
and send the person to the hospital. That's not going to happen. So that is not happening. We did

344
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:31,739
have an EMT there though, just in case anything weird happened, which there was plenty of

345
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:42,730
opportunity considering, you know, the amount of weird shit that people were doing. There's a couple

346
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:52,280
of great shots of whatever, Preston Magesto just standing there menacingly staring at the other

347
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:00,969
bench. There's a bunch of footage of the great video of the clown and the magician just both

348
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:10,940
like kind of staring at each other from across the bench. They were into it too. They went all out.

349
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,369
Oof, another F. Don't yell at me. It's not my fault. There's nothing I'm doing. I'm just sitting

350
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:33,500
here streaming. Oh, what a great call by Albertson. Paul Fondler is here. Paul Fondler is here and they

351
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,059
are no longer banned from the channel. But if they're here, just be aware. You will get banned

352
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:46,340
again if you say anything. Holy shit, Jesus. You will get banned again if you don't follow the rules.

353
00:39:46,340 --> 00:40:01,460
These are great photos. And everyone's saying, why were you accentuating your ass so much?

354
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:10,170
I wasn't. This is what you're supposed to do as an umpire. I trained to be an umpire. I watched

355
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:16,179
videos. I watched... Paul Fondler wants me to play Skyrim. Oh, that's at least a fucking 30 minute

356
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:28,019
ban. Ban him again. No, ban him for 30 minutes. That's what a dumb thing to say. Okay, but anyways,

357
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:35,860
so as an umpire, you need to be able to see the whole strike zone and you need to keep your chin

358
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,739
level with the catcher's head with your right knee in, it's called getting into the spot,

359
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:51,449
into the sort of back of the catcher, leaning in, head up, chin up, level. That's what I was doing.

360
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,769
So I'm not like arching my back to be like, oh yeah, I'm like, look at my ass. No, I'm doing,

361
00:40:55,769 --> 00:41:08,710
this is what umpire stance. You were definitely drunk. You don't know anything. I don't even know

362
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:22,119
who this is for. I think somebody at first base. Yeah, that's somebody at first base. I think,

363
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:29,639
okay, the empty seats make this funnier to me because this is nobody here. Like, wow,

364
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,239
the German baseball association. I've got this entire league of baseball and there's obviously

365
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:40,440
people have to be paid to be here and play and there's a whole operation and no one's here.

366
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:49,289
Nobody gives a shit about this. It's like part of it for me, especially when we, there was only

367
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:54,570
friends and family that were allowed, which is why you start to see some of the just, you know, the

368
00:41:54,730 --> 00:42:02,500
hold on, we got an action shot here. Yeah. Having like the 10 people back here in the audience is

369
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:15,349
just like, wow, nobody really cares. The JBA is a money laundering scheme. That's so funny.

370
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:21,380
The power cards are something too. So, so the power cards were not going to be in the show

371
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:28,039
because remember a year or two ago, I wanted to do this and I said that we had some more time.

372
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:34,380
So I got to add more stuff. So in the course from like 2021 to 2022, I was like, how do I make this

373
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,610
like weirder? And it was, oh, you could, the coaches have decks of different rarities. You know,

374
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:46,969
it's, it's almost implied that, that these guys had to fucking buy a bunch of card packs and

375
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:53,260
Hearthstone to get these, right? Like you, you had to, you had to spend like thousands of dollars in

376
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:59,019
card packs and they get these decks and they can make them. That was kind of what the implication

377
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:05,340
was. So they, you know, playing the legendary card of, oh, the baby is supposed to be, oh, wow,

378
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:12,409
that's, that's hard to get. Like all the coaches don't have that. And it's just like a pay to win.

379
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,829
Well, you got to have a good deck of gold and legendary. Yeah. I think there's,

380
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:26,360
there's a great space. Look, I don't, I'm not a baseball person. Really. I love the game. I've

381
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,500
loved it since I was a kid, but I think that that adds a huge amount of value to the game.

382
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,940
I think that having decks, you have like a pool of cards. Let's say there's like 50 cards that

383
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,570
each coach can choose from before the game. I think that's, that would add a lot of value.

384
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:50,280
That would add comedy value. Yeah. Wouldn't mean, I don't know. It would be fun. Were there any

385
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,969
unused power cards? There might've been. Let me look at the list. The list I have because they're,

386
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:01,820
yeah, let me see which ones didn't get played. It's so funny when the run through the bases

387
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:09,989
backwards got played and only one person did it. So the other person had to get like called out.

388
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:21,320
Oh, let me see. What, which, which ones maybe didn't get shown. I have a list here. Okay. So

389
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,679
five strikes. They used it on me. I was allowed five strikes. Uh, picture must use a beach ball

390
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:30,309
for the next at bat. I knew that was going to be messed up. I knew that was never going to work.

391
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:35,269
Uh, I did that just purely because I wanted to see what would happen. So that, that, I knew that

392
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:41,539
there was, that was impossible. Like it's literally not fucking possible. So what happens? Uh, other

393
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:46,170
coach must wear a bag on their head for the rest of the inning. We did that one. All runners must

394
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,820
run backwards through the bases. We did that one. Opposing teams mascot must pitch for the rest of

395
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:57,590
the inning. All runs are worth three runs. We did that. I don't think we did this one for the next

396
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:04,309
bat or the pitcher must pitch from 15 extra feet away from the plate. I don't think that one came

397
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:14,119
out. Did it? That's overpowered. No, that definitely didn't come up. Calling two more pitchers for this

398
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,519
at bat. That one came out. All opposing outfielders are removed for the next at bat. That one was a

399
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:25,300
big one. But, so what I'm thinking, right, is, Rukase, think about that. If you have this deck

400
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,260
of six cards, you can only play them once. You can't play them for the rest. You can only play

401
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,769
them one time and it is for whatever it says on the card. Can you imagine if you had bases loaded

402
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:38,570
and you didn't play your power cards until like the seventh inning and you remove all the

403
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:47,139
outfielders and all runs are worth three runs? That would be a big deal, right? So,

404
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,639
giving the cards to the coaches, we told the players, because all the players obviously know

405
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:58,280
the baseball much more than the coaches did. Except, I think one of the coaches knew a lot

406
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,659
about the game, but these guys live and breathe baseball. Some of them are pro players. So,

407
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:08,090
it was like, look, help the coaches, right? If you think there's a good situation, no, no, no.

408
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,289
Bring out the beach ball. Bring out the beach ball. Let's fuck them up. You know,

409
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:16,250
bring out the three pitchers and we'll get a walk. It was kind of up to them to figure that out.

410
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:21,159
None of these were scripted at all. They weren't. It was just whenever you want to use them,

411
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:26,570
whatever you feel like using them. It just had to happen before and at bat and you had to just tell

412
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:31,289
me. So, we could obviously tell, you know, I could relate to the truck and the truck could put the

413
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:39,460
graphic on the screen so you guys could see it. Are we going to get a power card tier list? I feel

414
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:47,400
like there's some really fun things you could do with a power card system in any sport. Because,

415
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:54,230
I don't know, I always thought that as I got older, I would enjoy sports more, right? Okay,

416
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,530
I'm in my 40s. Let's put on the game. Let's put the big game on, right? I kind of just don't care.

417
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,969
But if there was more stuff like this, and I know there is, for those that don't know,

418
00:47:04,969 --> 00:47:11,449
have you ever heard of the Savannah Bananas? They do fun stuff like this. There's a whole league

419
00:47:11,449 --> 00:47:15,750
and I would love to see more stuff like that. I would like to see it get more popular.

420
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,639
Bro, you're 37. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. But I always thought that I would want to be like,

421
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:27,300
oh yeah, you know, I don't know, get that cartoon shit out of here. I want traditional baseball and

422
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,989
I want traditional umpires. But the more that I think about it, I would have more fun. I would

423
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:39,400
have way more fun if there were power cards in baseball or in the NFL or in hockey. I feel like

424
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:52,809
it would change everything for me and I'd actually care about it again. ESPN was actually showing a

425
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:59,320
Savannah Bananas game on the same night. Really? That's so funny. Are you kidding me? Yeah,

426
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,820
cartoon baseball. Take it over. Take it over. You heard it here. Cartoon fucking fun baseball's

427
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:15,739
coming. We're coming. You were watching both at the same time? That's so fucking funny. No,

428
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:21,579
they're doing a lot of cool shit over there. They really are. I will definitely say that

429
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:30,730
changing the rules of the game would bring me kind of back to the game. When was the last time you

430
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:40,250
watched a full NFL game? It's been a long time. It's been a very long time. But can you imagine

431
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:45,989
sitting there like at a bar? I'm sitting, I'm thinking of like in a bar, fucking Boston,

432
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:52,579
like a Boston fucking bar. And all of a sudden, you know that your team that you're rooting for

433
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:58,099
has not used this power card yet and you're waiting. Come on, coach. Pull the fucking

434
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:02,099
understudy. Pull the understudy already. And all of a sudden, here comes the understudy.

435
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:13,210
Coaches would be ridiculed on when they used the cartoon power up. Oh my God. Yeah, John Stevenson

436
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,329
is a fucking idiot. Can you believe that he played the understudy card in the fucking first

437
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:22,539
inning? They could have used that at the top of the eighth. Literally worse, coach. I hope they

438
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:30,489
replace him next season. It would be, it would, it would add another meta to the game. And like the

439
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:40,579
bar goes crazy when this comes up because they know that they got to be on defense. Very upset at

440
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:52,119
something. I'm so glad that the pie, they actually got the pie being filmed because I, all right.

441
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:57,300
So there were two gags that I wanted to do in this kind of inning where I knew I was going to have

442
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,199
to, I was going to, I, this was not, I didn't know when this was going to happen, but I knew we were

443
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,179
going to do it. I knew I was going to get pieed in the face. I wanted someone in the audience to

444
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:13,690
throw a full large soda, a full fountain drink and hit me directly in the forehead. And we thought

445
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:18,489
about it. We were like, how do we make that, how do we make that work? Right? Because this net was

446
00:50:18,489 --> 00:50:25,019
here, but I wanted someone to stand up and I wanted them to like full on throw a full fountain soda.

447
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:28,940
And I wanted it to hit me right in the fucking mouth. I wanted it to hit me like explode in my face

448
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:34,699
and like, boom. And it would be unbearably awful to look at. I wanted to get hit directly in the

449
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:46,579
face. But there was no way we could do it without it. Why? Commitment, commitment. Do you guys know

450
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:56,579
that when me and Ster did the, he broke into my house and we argued over the money,

451
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:01,300
there was going to be a routine where we were like talking and hanging out and being like,

452
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,230
oh yeah, I know. Okay. Whatever, man. Like, fuck you. We were going to have another routine where

453
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:17,420
I got up, I got us sodas and he was going to do a huge loogie while I got up into my soda and I was

454
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:31,289
going to drink it. I was going to drink it. So I'll do it. If I think it was going to be funny

455
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:39,369
enough, I would have done it. You guys are fucked. No. Well, I mean, this is, I, we were just

456
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,530
sitting there thinking like, wouldn't that be funny if you like did like a huge, like, oh yeah, man.

457
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:47,369
Yeah, yeah. No, dude. Completely water under the bridge. It's fine. Oh yeah, dude. Thanks for the

458
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:55,139
coke. Oh yeah. I'll be right back. He's just like, boom. And I fucking just, oh man, I love soda and

459
00:51:55,139 --> 00:52:07,530
just like fucking chuck the whole thing. So yes, I wanted to take a full fountain soda to the face

460
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:13,019
and have it hit me in the face and have it hurt. Not that much, but like, you know, whatever.

461
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:18,409
So let me explain. I didn't want it to hurt. I want it, like, you know, I wanted it to be,

462
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:29,480
but I don't know. I just, I don't know. How can I describe this? Pre-pandemic Andy. Yeah. I mean,

463
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:36,969
come on, man. I want it to hurt. I don't look, okay. I don't want it to hurt. I want it to look

464
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:43,530
like it did. You're a masochist. No, I'm not. I just, I look, if somebody threw a soda at me at a

465
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:48,679
game, what would it look like? If I got pied in the face, what would it look like? It wouldn't be

466
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:54,619
like, oops, oh, here it comes. Oh, don't, no, wait, hold on. I'm not ready. No, that's not what would

467
00:52:54,619 --> 00:53:02,440
happen. If I got pied in the face, I'm getting pied in the face directly in the fucking face.

468
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:15,260
That's how it would happen if it were to happen. So the, the funny thing to tell you about this

469
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:21,000
was I was arguing with the coach and there was a play going on in the field. I was arguing with

470
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,960
the coach and he came over and full on did it directly into my face, right into my, my,

471
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,980
where my eyes are. And I just, I was arguing with, I didn't, I knew it was probably coming,

472
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,340
but I was arguing with the coach. So I took it full blast, just full on in the face and

473
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:46,469
it's shaving cream and it started to burn my eyes and it blew out the microphone. So

474
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:53,909
doing the manscaped ad, the microphone was destroyed here. Yeah. The microphone was destroyed

475
00:53:53,909 --> 00:54:05,739
from the shaving cream and right now my eyes are burning. They're on fire. So doing the manscaped

476
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:14,230
read turned out to be quite a disaster in regards to how I felt in between this inning and the next

477
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:20,780
one. I was dumping water in my eyes and it was okay after a little while. Shaving cream

478
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:30,489
thankfully is not that harsh after a while. But yeah, hold on, go back. Yeah. I think it added

479
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:37,500
to it. I think it was funnier that the, the microphone got destroyed. You could have had a

480
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:43,219
clown do the flower squirt gag. Yeah. Or I mean, I could have taken a full pie to the face. It

481
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:48,539
happened again at the end of the show too. It might've been the same, the same actor just kind

482
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,869
of looking for me. You know what I mean? But I did take a second one in the face at the end,

483
00:54:52,869 --> 00:55:01,690
during the fight. You had cue cards? Yeah, I had cue cards. I wanted to make sure I got it right

484
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:09,699
because they were a big supporter of the stream. And look, like Bansley, Manscaped, Surfshark,

485
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:15,829
they were, I've told you guys this before a thousand times. And I will say it again,

486
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:19,579
shows like this are really expensive. They take a lot of time. They take a lot of prep,

487
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:26,280
but they take a lot of money. And if there are, if there are companies that are into the idea

488
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,360
and they think it's really fun and they want it to be a good show, that's what they want.

489
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:38,440
If it makes sense to do like a thing that integrates it into the stream, that's better

490
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,389
for me. That's where you'll see those integrations. And there were, we were talking to a lot of

491
00:55:44,389 --> 00:55:52,659
companies and it's like, okay, who can I actually have like fun with? I want it to be a fun thing.

492
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:56,380
I don't want it to be a thing that people are annoyed with. And I think we did a pretty good

493
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:10,780
job with it. Yeah, I'm sorry about the Fs. I can't do anything about it. Real Baseball is sponsored

494
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:16,760
to hell and back anyways. Yeah. It feels like more authentic that way. Obviously the show is

495
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:27,860
expensive. So that helps. But yeah, I, anytime that you see a sponsor on this stream, it's a sponsor

496
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:32,099
that I know that I've been able to go kind of back and forth with and understand. And for me to be

497
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:38,070
like, I want the show to be the show. I want to be able to do something integrated in a fun way.

498
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:43,130
And that's what I want to do. And the companies that want to play ball like that, no pun intended,

499
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:46,920
those are the people that I want to work with. And that's who I will continue to work with, right?

500
00:56:46,920 --> 00:57:01,050
Stop leaning and sit straight. Me and my mom? Well, cause I'm reading chat. I'm reading chat over here.

501
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:11,719
Get a cigarette sponsorship. Stop talking about cigarettes. You weird person. Stop talking about

502
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:17,130
me smoking cigarettes. There's, okay, there's like a, there's a group of people in this community

503
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:22,300
that like are cigarette Andes and they think it's like wicked funny. They're like, oh, hey dude,

504
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,739
like say, like, you know, type, type like, hey, you should smoke a pack of cigarettes on screen

505
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:32,039
today. They're like this, they're like the cigarette comedians. There's a group of cigarette

506
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:39,300
comedians that are in this community. I mean, it's, I guess a kind of funny, but no, I would

507
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:47,500
never have a cigarette sponsor. I don't smoke cigarettes. And I don't, I don't like, you know

508
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:56,579
what? Who fucking knows? Right? Okay. On the next one, who knows? But I will tell you that yes,

509
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:03,659
there is a next one. And the next one is going to be fucking crazy. And I'm going to spoil it right

510
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:10,789
now. I'm going to spoil the next show right now. You ready? Baseball's over. Baseball's over. I can

511
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:17,780
talk about this now. I'm going to spoil this. It's time for you to get fucking spoiled. I'm just

512
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:32,329
kidding. It keeps freezing. Yeah. It's the stupid server that I'm streaming. I swallowed it. I'm

513
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:41,510
fine. But anyways, the next one is coming. The next one is going to be at the same scale as this.

514
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:52,809
It's probably bigger than this. I just like, I don't know. It is not wrestling, but I will tell

515
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:59,820
you it is. Okay. Here's a spoiler. You want your spoiler? Fine. It's not going to be three years

516
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:06,840
from now. I'm hopeful that this can be a thing we're doing by the end of the year or earlier,

517
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:15,769
depending. I will tell you who it is. I'll tell you who is involved. There's going to be a stream

518
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:25,739
on this channel in the next so on months, whenever it is, starring somebody who's become a pretty

519
00:59:25,739 --> 00:59:30,699
good friend of mine. Although I'm not really a friend. I would say more of an acquaintance.

520
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:39,639
You all know him as Mr. Breenz. He's working on something. He wants some of my help promoting it

521
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:47,989
and shouting it out, I guess. I don't want to give too many details away, but I've been contacted by

522
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:55,460
Mr. Breenz to help with promoting something. I haven't decided if I'm going to do it. I haven't

523
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:06,570
decided yet. But this will be, according to what Mr. Breenz has told me, this is going to be a

524
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:13,449
fucking huge show. Huge. So that's all I'm going to tell you. It's the only thing you will know

525
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:17,289
until it becomes a reality that I can actually really start to talk about. But

526
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:35,480
were there more technical problems than you expected? Oh yeah. Because we, because remember

527
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:44,730
the pre-recorded segments from that sports, like the crunch time, that show at the end, we did all

528
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:51,179
that before this stream. Everything was clean. There was no video problems. There was no video

529
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:57,900
processing problems. There was no encoding problems. And the stream started the first three to

530
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:03,380
four straight innings. It was about an hour and a half. It was perfect. There was not a single

531
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:10,980
problem. It just all of a sudden, in the fourth and fifth inning, it just kind of started to go

532
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:20,630
haywire. And they had no idea why it was happening. And they tried different video processors. The

533
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:26,309
stream came down like two or three different times to try different video stuff and encoding stuff.

534
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:32,710
I think they just switched ingest servers and it was fine after that. Which is, I don't know. We

535
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:39,900
have no idea. So it was weird how it was fine for the first three innings and then fine for the last

536
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:51,300
five innings. It was just weird. We don't really know. How did the Roadrunner joke happen? Well,

537
01:01:53,019 --> 01:02:00,389
the magic of television. I won't tell you that one. When are you going to do the auto-treat

538
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:11,559
review stream? Where's Bugleberry? Where's Bugleberry? Bugleberry has... I've been talking

539
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:17,909
to Bugleberry. You might hear from Bugleberry at some point soon. Oh, also, I want to bring this up.

540
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:27,099
I tweeted about it. But the merch for the show went so unbelievably quickly. We did not expect

541
01:02:27,099 --> 01:02:35,480
it to go that fast. So all the souvenir balls and some other game used stuff, we kind of replenished

542
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:42,570
the store. So the souvenir balls went so quickly. It was just like, oh, should we just do more of

543
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:49,300
these? So there are now, we replenished the store with some items. There are new, you can buy a

544
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:56,019
signed ball. Not, I think there's a limited supply of the in the stream stuff that was used in the

545
01:02:56,019 --> 01:03:01,369
stream. But we're replenishing the souvenir balls that I'll sign. Because I, I don't know,

546
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:07,349
if you have like limited quantity of stuff like that, I want people that wanted one to be able

547
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:17,579
to get one. And so we're just going to put it back up. So that's German985.com. Store is there. Go

548
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:24,679
take a look at what's available again. And you're saying it. We had the, we had the sign in the

549
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:31,269
outfield. So let's talk about it. Grotto Beasts. You know, the sign's in the outfield. Oh, this is

550
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:42,039
a great, this is a great picture. The sign was in the outfield here and it's coming along. I will

551
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:54,860
reliably tell you we, okay, just want to make sure I didn't puke. We are, I want to say, maybe two to

552
01:03:54,860 --> 01:04:06,280
three months away from taking pre-orders. It is imminent. There's been a lot of play testing,

553
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:18,199
apparently very fun. It's a full game. It's got a lot of cards. And we're very hopeful that I can

554
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:27,000
finally tell you that somewhere into holiday of this year is when you will actually be able to

555
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:41,019
purchase this and own it. Physical cards, yes. Physical cards. There are a lot of cards. And as

556
01:04:41,019 --> 01:04:47,860
we get closer, we'll start to talk about that more. But I really want it to be kind of a holiday

557
01:04:47,860 --> 01:05:02,550
this year. So we're, it's, it's, it's coming along. Does it come in a loot crate? No. You buy the,

558
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:11,269
what are you talking about, loot crate? They're physical NFTs. It's a fucking card, man. It's,

559
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:24,599
no, you stop saying that. Physical NFT. Oh yeah, this part's so funny. Okay, so we asked if they

560
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,590
could smoke. Like, oh yeah, is it okay to have like a cigarette? Like, is the, you know, the,

561
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:34,739
the circus, you know, I got, I, my, my guys sitting there, they're smoking. We, we were going to do

562
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:40,739
a routine where everyone on the bench on the circus team had a cigarette in their mouth and

563
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:49,289
they were all smoking. But it turns out that was not going to fly. So we, we were allowed to have

564
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:57,429
like one, but every single person, we wanted a shot of like 20 people in the dugout, just all

565
01:05:57,429 --> 01:06:03,780
having a cigarette in their mouth. But we also wanted to respect the field, too. And that's,

566
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:11,130
I don't want to, you know, disrespect somebody else's space. If it's like, no, that's not fucking

567
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:20,309
okay. Then like, okay. Forcing actors to smoke. No, no, no, no, no. It was like if they did smoke.

568
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,980
I don't know how many people smoked. They could have had a fake one, right? It would have been fake.

569
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:38,659
What a cigarette comedian that would be. All right. All right, you got me. No, you got me. No,

570
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:45,980
that's, that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a hypocrite. That's, that's fair.

571
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:52,730
All the cigarette comedians. The community of like 40 cigarette comedians in this community.

572
01:06:52,730 --> 01:07:00,900
Yeah, that's fair. I'll take it. I'll take the loss on that one. Unban that person. They're banned

573
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:18,969
for five seconds. What is, what is going on here? Am I about to get slapped? Did I get slapped in

574
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:31,829
the face? I don't think so. Oh no, right. This is when the mascots started fighting each other for

575
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:52,150
the first time. The mascots, I don't know anything. This is so perfect. I wonder if he go,

576
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:59,510
I wonder if he went through more than one cigarette. Who designed the mascots? Those were just,

577
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:08,059
we just bought them from a mascot wholesaler or retailer. Took a while to find the right ones,

578
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:21,750
but we just bought them. The mascots having, dude, the part where the mascots are in the back fighting

579
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:28,340
with the trash can and the trash. He's like smashing them like down here with the trash can.

580
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:39,829
I remember seeing that and going, oh fuck. I don't want to give too much away, but I, yes,

581
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:51,100
that was, whatever. It was, he would snap his neck. Ugh. Mother horns. They were people,

582
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:58,710
they were actually people in the audience that had like a clown noisemaker and it was distracting.

583
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:04,090
It was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. They did it after every other pitch. It was distracting.

584
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:23,590
It really was like the video processing. So this is what it looked like up here. This was a,

585
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:31,689
this was like the video zone. They were, they were the production truck, which is why it was so weird

586
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:36,840
when the videos started having problems. Cause like, this is all broadcast equipment. This is,

587
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:47,260
this is all, these guys do this for a living. This is broadcast baseball level equipment.

588
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:53,140
So it was just so bizarre. It was just like, why is this happening? Why the fuck are we dropping

589
01:09:53,939 --> 01:10:02,010
frames? And like I could tell you right now, why the fuck am I dropping frames right now?

590
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:20,039
Who were you rooting for? I was rooting for a good shell. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer.

591
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:32,279
Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer. True though. But I mean,

592
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:46,789
the circus though. I mean, it just, it's a circus. Unicycles, fire breathing. We got all these props

593
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:52,739
down here too. They had just so much random shit down here that they were just told. So we told

594
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:56,520
them, we were just like, oh yeah, just do whatever you want. You guys can do whatever you want. You

595
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,960
want to like throw stuff at me. You want to walk around and make balloon animals and shit. Please

596
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,520
do. And that's what they were just doing in the dugout. They were just having a grand old time.

597
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:16,170
They were having a grand old time. Favorite player. I can't tell you a favorite player.

598
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:27,060
So many of them were so funny and they were so good. Like how do you pick one of all these

599
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:38,579
great performers and great players? I don't, I can't. Xavier McMagic. Yeah. I mean, Schmidt

600
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:47,609
Poppo is up there too. Honk. Honk was up there too. Honk had the Inside the Park home run,

601
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:56,649
which was hilarious. Yeah. David Honk had it inside the park. I thought that was gone too.

602
01:11:56,649 --> 01:12:05,819
It was so close. What about the security? The security guard was an actor. There's another actor.

603
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:14,170
He was awesome. Both the security guard and the streaker, they were both actors and they were great.

604
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:22,100
They were fantastic. They did their roles very well. Very believable. And yeah, here he is. He

605
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:28,970
was just, he was just walking around too. He was just walking around out kind of on the field with

606
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:44,630
his two-seater shirt on. Oh, there's Schmidt Poppo right there. Schmidt Poppo was, oh no,

607
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:54,060
it's going back on. How many people involved knew what your streams were beforehand? Um, there were

608
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:58,600
a few people that knew the channel, but we kept it really under wraps for a long time because

609
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:05,340
obviously we didn't want the location to leak prematurely. Because look, there's one thing about

610
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:13,640
having your location leak 10 minutes into the show and you have security versus the location is

611
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,369
leaked a month or two before the show and people know where it's going to be. There's a huge

612
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:26,010
difference. So that was obviously part of the reason why we kept it really kind of tight,

613
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:32,550
even to cast and crew. But a few days before the show and like obviously during the show and the

614
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:42,680
day before the show, people, people did know. How come the audio is not syncing? Uh, because I keep

615
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:51,449
dropping frames to the server. You couldn't place Missouri on a map by the way. I can. It's just not

616
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:59,579
under pressure. What was what you, what was the thing that you needed this particular location

617
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:04,550
for? Why you delayed it? Well, there were a couple of reasons why this show has changed a few times.

618
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:09,500
Here's, here's the kind of long and short of it. So back in 2020, when I wanted to do the show

619
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:18,300
originally, I mean, lockdown happened in March and we had, we, all these designs that you're seeing

620
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,899
here, a lot of them were, we did, there was a lot of pre-work that was already done. We were about

621
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:31,939
to print the jerseys before we said, no, we can't do it. So lockdown happened in March of 2020.

622
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:39,140
And then March, April, May, June, July, it was like July of 2020 when I wanted to do this show.

623
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:46,539
And that was back when they were saying that people, having more than 10 people in a room was,

624
01:14:46,539 --> 01:14:51,819
was not allowed. It was like, you couldn't do it. It was like very, very ill-advised against,

625
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:56,300
there was no vaccines at that point. There was no treatment at that point.

626
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:03,210
So we were just like, am I really going to put like 60 people in the same area in the same room

627
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:11,300
three or four months after lockdown? No, testing was not even easy either. It wasn't like you could

628
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:20,899
go to CVS and go get 20 tests. No, it wasn't like that. So I just said, you know what, whatever,

629
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:24,840
cancel all the shows I really wanted to do and we'll just come back to this later.

630
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:34,140
And then in 2021, we had, we had a venue, we had a certain venue. We were at a different stadium

631
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:40,329
and we had to change it because there was something, I don't want to speak completely

632
01:15:40,329 --> 01:15:46,119
wrong here, but there was a venue problem that we couldn't really, we had, we couldn't overlook it.

633
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:50,090
And it was like, you know what, it was right before baseball season was about to start,

634
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:56,569
kind of around the same, because here's the thing, getting baseball players, they play baseball in

635
01:15:56,569 --> 01:16:02,250
the baseball season and trying to get a stadium like this or any of the other ones during the

636
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:08,460
season where everyone's playing is almost impossible because there's games here.

637
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:12,140
There's games here every day. There's games here every other day, right? In a lot of these

638
01:16:12,140 --> 01:16:19,020
stadiums. So minor league, semi-pro leagues, you can't just be like, hey, I want clowns and

639
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,819
magicians to throw pies at each other. It's like, well, we have, we're in the middle of a fucking

640
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:30,979
season, man. You can't do that. Yeah. These are real players. These are real baseball players.

641
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:36,579
This year, when we finally got it off the ground, something that a lot of people might not realize

642
01:16:36,579 --> 01:16:44,460
about a stadium is it's not really just baseball. There's a lot of work that goes into a stadium

643
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:52,340
on the field. And from my understanding, they will not, a lot of stadiums do not want you to

644
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:57,619
play ball on their field unless it is ready to play ball on. There's liability problems,

645
01:16:57,619 --> 01:17:03,420
right? Like, hey, the mound was fucked up and one of my guys fell off the rubber and broke his ankle.

646
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:09,750
There's a lot of stuff that they can kind of cancel shows for and can can events for.

647
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:15,449
The stream has fallen apart. Yeah, dude, I don't want to fucking restart and go play

648
01:17:15,449 --> 01:17:20,600
server hopping until I find one that works. But I have to ping somebody at Twitch about this.

649
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:26,789
It's kind of fucking ridiculous, if I'm honest. So I got to talk to somebody and be like, can you

650
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:35,529
just see where my traffic is going and find out why the fuck this is happening? But I mean, it's

651
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:44,760
fine, but I've dropped 10,000 frames streaming to a West Coast server. Do I really have to go to

652
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:58,020
Mexico to have my stream stay on without problems? Whatever. But yeah, a lot goes into

653
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:03,399
getting the ink dry on having this kind of location, which was a huge pain in the ass.

654
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:08,060
But thankfully, we finally got into agreement with CarShield and they were completely on board with

655
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,819
everything. So it was like, yes, finally we got the venue. The venue was the hardest thing to get.

656
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:24,949
And then the players. Two of the hardest things. Mexico Arc. Yeah, they have to make sure the dirt

657
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:31,529
is soft. They have to make it because it's there's liability problems with if the field is not ready

658
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:42,199
to be used so that you have to be. Obviously, it's a lot of work, a lot of time. Oh, look at how happy

659
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:53,819
he looks. Isn't this the banner to the Discord right now? The seventh inning stretch or I think

660
01:18:53,819 --> 01:19:02,539
it was actually the eighth inning stretch. This guy. I love this guy. This face. He had this face

661
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:08,119
all night. It didn't change once. He came up to me with the balls and he had that face. He was in

662
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:22,010
character and he nailed it. They're so good. Is one of the qualifications to be able to ride a unicycle?

663
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:31,510
Well, that was the performance group. So that was a group. Were they real clowns? Yes. Well,

664
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:38,039
they were performers. They were a performance group based in St. Louis. Who came up with the

665
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:45,529
players' names? I wrote them all down four or five months ago. They're all, I just wrote them all

666
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:53,899
down. I sat there and just was like, I'm going to come up with names. How much was improv and how

667
01:19:53,899 --> 01:20:02,220
much was scripted? So with an event like this, when you have a bunch of people, it's because it's not

668
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:08,180
just me doing something. And I saw a lot of people saying, man, you were just the umpire. I really

669
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:14,569
wish you were like a commentator or you did something else besides being the umpire. But I

670
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:23,319
didn't want to do that. I wanted to be this kind of umpire character of guy that didn't do that

671
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:28,460
stuff. I didn't want to read from a script in this show. I wanted it to be outrageous. I wanted to

672
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:35,060
get pied in the face and shit and not know when. So before the show even happened, and what I do

673
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:42,180
with pretty much any of these things that you ever see, is I write like three pages or four pages

674
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:47,590
just of stuff. I want to see this. I want it to be like this. I want their names to be this. I want

675
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:53,210
it to look like this. I want, this is what I, inning by inning, I kind of gave like what I was

676
01:20:53,210 --> 01:21:00,760
looking for. And I would say like, obviously the Road Runner bit was something we planned to do.

677
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,779
That's something I wanted to see. The Streaker thing was planned. It was that we want the

678
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:07,739
Streaker to come out in the seventh inning. That was going to happen. That was planned.

679
01:21:07,739 --> 01:21:12,569
But when they got out, when they got out, when the Streaker took his shirt off and came to the

680
01:21:12,569 --> 01:21:20,020
field, they were, they were directed to just do whatever they wanted. It was an improv show. It

681
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:24,949
was up to them. And obviously I gave them guidelines of here's what I would like to see you do. Here's

682
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:30,600
what I don't want to see you really do. But everybody here was just like, hey, let's go do

683
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,489
this. That would be fun. Hey, let's go do this. That would be fun. Hey, you know what? I'm going

684
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:44,170
to get on the unicycle this inning. So if a ball gets hit to me, good luck. What does the

685
01:21:44,170 --> 01:21:50,119
banner behind me say? Something, something bugging you. Should I add for something?

686
01:21:50,119 --> 01:22:07,109
What did you not want the Streaker to do? Take his underwear off. Got it. The casters were legit as

687
01:22:07,109 --> 01:22:17,189
well. Yeah, I think the number one thing that kind of reiterated to this actor was, hey yeah,

688
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:20,899
just make sure those underwear, those pants don't come off. Just make sure that doesn't come off.

689
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:23,699
Like this, just don't, just make sure your underwear doesn't come off. Keep your underwear on.

690
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:31,210
Keep this on. Don't take this off. Do not take that off for any reason. Because I would be

691
01:22:31,289 --> 01:22:44,739
taking a pretty long vacation from streaming, I think, if that were the case. Did you practice

692
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:51,289
plate umpiring? No, I watched a lot of videos and I, we spent the previous day, I was kind of going

693
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:56,550
over, I was behind the plate, obviously, when we filmed a lot of the other scenes. So I had a lot

694
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:07,079
of time to figure out how to do it. This was planned too. Like I want, okay, so one of the

695
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:11,289
things that I want to do is I wanted to throw too many people out, so I had to play in the game.

696
01:23:11,289 --> 01:23:16,090
One thing that I didn't get to do that I really wanted to do, so the joke was I was going to throw

697
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:20,729
out too many people on the circus side, so then I would have to play in the game. And I wanted to

698
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:29,449
go into center field and still call balls and strikes from center field. You were a trash umpire.

699
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:35,340
Okay, I got the whole field to look at here. I wanted to be in center field and be like,

700
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:52,810
but it just turned out we, they, they, we just didn't do it. Did you know that the player,

701
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:55,770
that player was stealing balls from you? No, I didn't. I didn't feel that at all.

702
01:23:55,770 --> 01:24:03,079
Because remember, I have this big umpire turtle armor suit on. So like, I have a bunch of shit

703
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:12,890
here. I had two like mic packs. I had this in-ear like secret service ear. I had this microphone

704
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:16,649
that was here and they were all packed here. So I, they had so much shit all over me. I couldn't

705
01:24:16,649 --> 01:24:21,739
tell. He stole a ball from me and then he tagged me out with it and that's what, and then I figured

706
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:24,859
it out. I was like, you got these two balls out here. That's not the right ball. I was safe.

707
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:31,859
I actually was safe. That whole event was unironically the best thing I've ever seen on

708
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:39,939
Twitch. I'm really glad you think that. I really am. Every time I ever want to do something like

709
01:24:39,939 --> 01:24:44,840
this, I think the most important thing that I, I relay this to the people that are here too,

710
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:50,680
is the whole entire goal is to try to have as much fun as possible. I just, that's all I,

711
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:58,340
that's all I fucking want, I promise. And I think that when you have, when you bring in people

712
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:04,279
and everybody from this guy to this guy to this guy, to the people in the stands, to the people

713
01:25:04,279 --> 01:25:08,199
that were running production, to all the people out here, and when it's clear that people are

714
01:25:08,199 --> 01:25:16,489
having a good time, it is a good time. And that's undeniable that it was a fun time. Forget about

715
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:21,670
any of the technical problems that kind of drop the stream up and down a few times. Every time

716
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:27,029
a show happens, I, at the end of it, I sit down afterwards and I go, was that fun? Did people have

717
01:25:27,029 --> 01:25:30,470
a good time? That's all I care about. And if the answer is yes, then all right, then that's great.

718
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:43,609
I'm glad we did it. There's never a moment where I'm, I'm not trying to like one-up like Dollhouse,

719
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:47,899
I think, right? Because Dollhouse was so ridiculous and so much went into that.

720
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:53,460
That was a multi-stream, multi-day event. I don't, I don't care about, you know, oh,

721
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,899
I gotta do something that's like Dollhouse. It's gotta be as big as Dollhouse. It's gotta be.

722
01:25:56,899 --> 01:26:02,500
Dollhouse was, was, was an unbelievable, astronomical amount of money. Oh, okay, I've gotta,

723
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:07,539
I've gotta spend hundreds of thousands of dollars again on this one. That's not what happens. It's

724
01:26:07,539 --> 01:26:12,920
just, I want to make something happen. If I think it's fun, then I want to do it. So there's never

725
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:19,109
a comparison. There's never like a, oh yeah, I mean that was all right, but like it fucking wasn't

726
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:25,770
as good as Dollhouse. This next stream, I gotta spend a million dollars on it to make sure it's

727
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:32,250
better than Dollhouse. No, that's not what I think about. It just wasn't good. Did I have a fun time?

728
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:38,300
Did everyone else there have a fun time? And it was the, the, did people watching think it was fun?

729
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:45,750
Yes. Good. Okay, let's do the next one now. The cost doesn't matter if it's a fun show.

730
01:26:46,949 --> 01:26:54,279
Yeah, and I, I told, I did an interview. Me and Jake kind of sat down with Kotaku, if you saw the

731
01:26:54,279 --> 01:27:00,869
article before the stream. And one of the questions that Kotaku, Kotaku editor or whatever asked was,

732
01:27:00,869 --> 01:27:04,630
you know, what, like these big shows, right, when you do them, like how do you feel about them? And

733
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:11,340
do you think it's like moving the platform to a new place? And, but I'll kind of reiterate it again.

734
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:19,770
It's a lot, it's a lot of money. And it's, a lot of shit can go wrong. So thinking that,

735
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:24,489
oh, I wait, why don't more people do stuff like this? How come more people aren't doing this?

736
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:30,600
I want to see that do more. But when you think about it, it's like, it's, it's a lot of stress

737
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,659
and it's a lot of money. And some people don't fucking have that ability to do that. Right? Like

738
01:27:35,659 --> 01:27:40,600
some people don't have hundreds of thousands of fucking dollars to throw at stuff like this.

739
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:46,520
They just don't. And that's something that I think I to understand is you, you try to do what you can

740
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:53,300
with what you have. And yeah, there's a lot of risk. There's a ton of risk. So I, I never want

741
01:27:53,300 --> 01:28:00,420
to put myself on some kind of pedestal because I know like how stressful and how scary and shit it

742
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:05,189
is to try to put something like this on. That's why I never want to be like up there on like a

743
01:28:05,189 --> 01:28:27,779
pedestal. I don't like it. Rich Randy. They're not as rich as you, but I, you're a humble billionaire.

744
01:28:27,779 --> 01:28:33,270
No, but the point is, I guess the whole point of this is when you see the price tags of some

745
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:41,800
of these shows, maybe, and you hear about it. If I have, you know, like tens, if not hundreds

746
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:47,479
of thousands of dollars for a show, the show is going to be tens of thousands or hundreds of

747
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:50,840
thousands of dollars for the show. You know what I'm saying? It's like, if I have this opportunity,

748
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,420
which I'm lucky every fucking day to be here and sitting here doing this, if I'm given the opportunity

749
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:01,770
to be able to have somebody like Bansley come in and support the show, manscaped, right? Like I can

750
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:08,149
take in this money and yeah, let's do something fucking huge if I can. And look, this could have

751
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:15,750
just not been funny at all. This could have been terrible. This could have been so not funny and

752
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:24,140
shit. And it was like, well, you know what? We tried, right? We tried. So, but there's a lot of

753
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:32,550
risk that comes with this. And I, like I said, I never wanted to be thought of as like, oh yeah,

754
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,710
yeah, yeah. Of course this show isn't going to be, I mean, yeah. Oh, Jerma, you put on these

755
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:43,909
huge money shows and they're so fun. And well, I wish more people would do that. I'm in a fucking

756
01:29:43,909 --> 01:29:56,359
crazy opportunity and I don't want to take for granted for any day of the week. It's a very unique

757
01:29:56,359 --> 01:30:03,180
insane opportunity to be looking at these pictures, which is why I try to, I don't know.

758
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:10,489
I try to keep my brain grounded as much as I can. And like I said, before one of these shows goes

759
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:17,380
off, I'll be like in my hotel room and just be sitting there going like, fuck, I hope this is

760
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:26,340
fun. I hope this is funny. Whoa, this is, hope this works. The announcers were amazing. They were.

761
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:31,159
And speaking of hotel rooms, I've got to talk about this. This is important. You want to know

762
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:42,569
what I found out about a hotel room recently, staying in a hotel in St. Louis? You cannot

763
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:52,539
watch a horror movie in a hotel room. You can't watch a horror movie in a hotel room. I was

764
01:30:52,539 --> 01:31:07,180
watching the Black Phone and I'm sitting there watching it. And every so often there's just

765
01:31:07,180 --> 01:31:16,170
people screaming. And I'm just sitting there like, fucking turn the volume down. Like,

766
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:18,409
I swear to God, nobody's getting killed in here. You know what I mean? Like all,

767
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:27,529
when you go to a hotel room, you are surrounded by complete strangers sleeping in other rooms near you.

768
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:34,060
You can't fucking watch a horror movie in a hotel room. You'd have to sit there and just go like,

769
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:39,399
all right, let's put, this was a scary one. Let's put it on. The second that you hear that scream,

770
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:48,100
and then you fuck, I can't, now there's like something going on. I can't even hear the dialogue

771
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:55,479
because what do you, what did they say? I gotta, I can't watch this. And then you turn it all the

772
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:59,319
way down and you don't, you're missing dialogue. So you're like, fuck, I gotta turn it up, up,

773
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:04,600
up, up, up. I still can't hear it up, up, up, up, up. Another scream. And it's even louder than the

774
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,920
first one that you tried to correct with the volume decrease in the first place. And I'm just

775
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:14,600
imagining somebody walking down the hall, whether somebody from like a staff member of the hotel

776
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:18,279
or somebody like getting out, like, okay, kids, it's time to go to the water park.

777
01:32:18,279 --> 01:32:28,760
And you just hear somebody screaming, fucking screaming for their life in this room. I just

778
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:36,020
can't. I can't. You can't watch a horror movie in a hotel room unless you turn it all the way down

779
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:45,529
really low and put on subtitles. And it sucks. It's such a pain in the ass because you have to

780
01:32:45,529 --> 01:32:49,930
volume down, volume up, volume down, volume up. You're like this weird remote control

781
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:58,840
quarterback of the whole, and I just want to watch the movie. You paid for the room. Who cares?

782
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:07,029
Yeah, but like, dude, I don't know. It's like, I feel weird. I feel weird sitting here just

783
01:33:07,029 --> 01:33:12,760
listening to somebody scream wicked loud in the hotel room. It's just like, fuck, I don't want

784
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:26,710
you to hear that. Self-conscious Samuel. It's just a movie. Don't worry. We'll back you up.

785
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:32,220
But the people in the stands, actors, know they were, I think they were like friends and family.

786
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:43,020
These guys were wild. They were having the time of their life. That was, that made me so happy.

787
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:47,850
Seeing how much fun all these guys were having was just like, all right, this is,

788
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:51,770
you're having a good time. You're having a good time. You just came up to the plate. You're doing

789
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:57,100
like this funny routine. You're loving it. I'm loving it. You know, this is great. I'm having a

790
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:06,329
blast. Bluetooth headphones exist. I don't, I'm not, I'm kind of a Bluetooth headphone.

791
01:34:06,329 --> 01:34:20,939
I don't have a Bluetooth headphone. I doubt they would care. People have fistfights in hotel rooms.

792
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:25,979
If all I'm imagining is I'm sitting there watching and I'm like, you know what? I don't give a shit.

793
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:33,500
I paid for this room. I don't care. We're watching. I'm watching the Scream movies at full volume.

794
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:39,979
Right? I don't even care anymore. And then I get halfway through. I'm 20 minutes into the movie

795
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:45,130
and it's like, there's a knock at the front door. And I look out, it's like a hotel staff person.

796
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:49,300
Yeah, we're getting a noise complaint here that somebody was screaming in here. I'm just like,

797
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,380
ah, I knew it. I knew it. And one day it's going to happen and I'm going to, I was going to freak

798
01:34:53,380 --> 01:35:07,539
me out. Why don't you have AirPods? I don't, I don't have ear pods. Yeah, this is the brawl.

799
01:35:07,539 --> 01:35:16,899
And they, they took the brawl seriously. Yes, this was supposed to happen. It just, I can tell you,

800
01:35:16,899 --> 01:35:21,220
I don't want to ruin the show, but it was really funny how this actually ended up. Should I do,

801
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:26,500
this is behind the scenes shit. Let's talk about it. Okay. So you want to hear the behind the

802
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:33,380
scenes of how fucked up the last like 20 minutes was? If you don't want to have the magic of the

803
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:40,250
show ruined, I would mute now and come back in 10 minutes. Okay. So do you see the inning that

804
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:43,369
we're in right now? This is the top of the 10th. This is, this is not, this is the bottom of the

805
01:35:43,369 --> 01:35:52,779
10th inning. We went to extra innings. We were not supposed to go to extra innings. So what happened

806
01:35:52,779 --> 01:36:00,970
was the magician's team was playing really well and it got to a point where they were ahead by

807
01:36:00,970 --> 01:36:08,550
way too much because they had to be in their dugout or the crunch take routine because they

808
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:15,960
charge out of their dugout in the footage that we had already recorded. So we were like, oh shit,

809
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:21,800
we can't end the game because the magicians have to be in their dugout. They have to charge from

810
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:30,939
their dugout. So it was like, okay, I'm going to blow a bunch of shit calls and I'm going to make

811
01:36:30,939 --> 01:36:43,510
sure that the game gets tied. So we go to extras. There you go. Now what happened in extras, I was

812
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:48,310
not, I couldn't control. We just needed to make sure that they got another at bat so they could

813
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:59,430
charge out to the field. Of course it's rigged you dummies LMAO. But it wasn't though. Okay,

814
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:07,369
we just lost track of the, okay, the entire game was not scripted. Well, hold on a second. Wait a

815
01:37:07,369 --> 01:37:13,449
minute. If you have a problem with that, hold on a second. Those of you that have a problem with the

816
01:37:13,449 --> 01:37:20,250
magicians getting that extra at bat, wait a minute, hold on here though. The California Circus got a

817
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:31,109
free run that was predetermined because of the mascot fight. Um, sorry. That circus run was a

818
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:48,859
predetermined run. They both got something extra. Double rigged. Is every stream you've ever done

819
01:37:48,859 --> 01:38:00,579
scripted? No, not this one. This is the first one. The fact that it ended with the magicians

820
01:38:00,579 --> 01:38:05,659
winning and then devolving into the funniest German moment in a long time is the best thing

821
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:15,430
about the baseball stream. Yeah, I mean, it was just fun. It was just, I knew it was going to be

822
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:21,529
fun. I think like Jake asked me this question. Some people in production, some of the performers

823
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:25,699
come up and then like, we like, we just talked about. So I like, I got approached by some people

824
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:31,270
on the crew and they're just like, why did you like do this? Well, what's the point of this?

825
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:40,579
Is it, are you like, why, why this? Why this? And I have the same answer and the answer I'll give you

826
01:38:40,579 --> 01:38:46,579
too. The same answer I'll give anybody. I thought it would be funny. That's it. That's all it takes.

827
01:38:46,579 --> 01:38:52,760
I saw in my head, okay, so before Dollhouse, the only reason why I wanted to do Dollhouse is

828
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:58,699
in my head, I was like imagining, I was kind of watching in my head people in these black spandex

829
01:38:58,699 --> 01:39:05,590
suits, moving furniture around in like a house that I was like frozen in because it's like the

830
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:11,420
buy phase. And that was the only reason why I wanted to do it. That was like the sole reason to be

831
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:14,539
like, I'm going to start writing it and I want to write the whole thing and I want to get the

832
01:39:14,539 --> 01:39:20,359
whole thing the way I want it. It's like a one joke is what makes me want to do something. And

833
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:26,739
the one joke that I wanted to do here that made the whole thing happen was this end of the game

834
01:39:26,739 --> 01:39:32,819
thing. The fact that it's not just this game, oh look, hey, here we are at crunch time. I'm going

835
01:39:32,819 --> 01:39:37,659
to go with the other games to me was like, that was why I wanted to do the show because that would

836
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:43,060
be funny. And that's it. So after that one thing that I see in my head that I think is interesting

837
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:46,739
or funny enough for me is when I go, okay, so now how do I make a whole thing out of this? How do

838
01:39:46,739 --> 01:39:52,869
I do a whole show? How would I do it? And then I'm like, you know, I start like writing. Okay,

839
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:57,029
so the German Baseball Association, I guess that's what it is. Okay, so here we are, blah, blah, blah,

840
01:39:57,029 --> 01:40:01,350
and this is what's happening and this is a beautiful day and whatever. And I just sort

841
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:07,140
of write a bunch of jokes and a bunch of things that I want to do and see. Then I get on the phone

842
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:13,529
and I start talking to Community Jake, who is the production guy. He's like the, yeah, let's try to

843
01:40:13,529 --> 01:40:19,909
make that happen. I send him the, all the stuff that I write and we go back and forth for months

844
01:40:19,909 --> 01:40:30,250
and then it happens. Admit it, you just want to be Brewster's Millions IRL. What a specific reference.

845
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:47,500
The baseballs are sold out again? What? Hold on, the baseball, the souvenir baseballs are gone.

846
01:40:47,500 --> 01:41:00,090
What? What was the replacement? What was the thing that started the Who Replaced Me? What joke was

847
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:05,779
that that made that happen? Very simple. It was me sitting behind somebody with a clipboard

848
01:41:05,779 --> 01:41:11,560
and then pretending to be me while I like coach them to be me. That was it. That was like what

849
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,729
started the rest of it. Like I just saw me with a clipboard like, I'm sorry, you didn't do the look

850
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:21,510
at me right. That was enough. It's usually one thing gets me going and then I just start like

851
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:30,550
writing stuff. Remember, your entire stream was an American Dad episode, I'm not kidding.

852
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:37,510
Yeah, it was also a Simpsons episode too. No, Futurama. It was also in Futurama.

853
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:42,779
Only the game used balls are sold out. Okay, all right, all right.

854
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:56,100
I don't think that, look, the idea of like a cartoon baseball league with a bunch of

855
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:01,689
jokey baseball is not a new idea but it's an idea that I wanted to do, right, and to see if I could

856
01:42:01,689 --> 01:42:15,930
make it fun. It's not a new idea. Both are out of stock? Really? Oh, shit. Okay, they both are out

857
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:30,180
of stock. Both are. That's impossible. That's impossible. Should I do more? We want more.

858
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:34,090
Should I just make that up? Did somebody actually say that? Should I just make that up?

859
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:48,869
Should I restock it again? Get to signing. Yes, please, please, please. Jesus. All right, let me

860
01:42:50,380 --> 01:43:00,779
hold on. Let me talk. I got to talk to Community Jake because I can see if it's like, is it possible

861
01:43:00,779 --> 01:43:13,460
for me to do more? How many? I have to figure out how many that are going to be available.

862
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:18,520
All right, I'll get back to your next stream. We might do another restocking so keep an eye out.

863
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:26,890
A third, a second time or at least the balls. What was the joke that started the archaeology

864
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:38,060
stream? Me and Holly breaking a geode outside. It was like, it was like just fun to do. We got a

865
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:46,020
geode one day and I was like, oh, this is cool. This sounds fun. And it was like, all right,

866
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:54,460
now let's make up this whole thing. To FPS Andy, I can't fix it. I can't fix it. I can't fix it.

867
01:43:54,460 --> 01:44:01,340
I can't fix it. I'm sorry. Look, on the next stream, I will make sure that I'm on the right

868
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:06,020
server. Whether that's, oh, I have to go to Dallas. You're going to try this? Try Dallas.

869
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:17,699
Try Chicago. Try Mexico. Try San Francisco. Try San Jose. Try Boston. I'm going to jump around to

870
01:44:17,699 --> 01:44:31,100
every server again and just run a upload test and then try it again and we'll do it again.

871
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:46,579
Just fix it. I wish it were that easy. He only knows five cities. Try harder. Your favorite

872
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:54,819
character Morty was added to multiverses. Oh, we'll play it. You bet your ass we will. All right,

873
01:44:54,819 --> 01:44:59,750
let's keep going. But yeah, this was, we had to make sure the magicians were going to come out

874
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:07,220
at the right time. You know what's really funny about this though? I think there's a few clips

875
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:10,579
of this when it's, when we said, all right, that's it. We're out. Like, that's it. That's it. That's

876
01:45:10,579 --> 01:45:19,340
it. A lot of these guys knew each other and see they're like kind of, you know, hugging it out.

877
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:24,140
Like that was a fun day. It's really cool. It was awesome to see it. Like once ever that was,

878
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:38,199
oh wow, you can see, you can pie right in the face right here. When are you going to do Mr. Satan?

879
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:55,819
Um, like a whole stream? An entire stream of Mr. Satan. Oh, this is footage. Well, I mean,

880
01:45:55,819 --> 01:46:00,390
let me, I can, let me show this. Somebody has like from the stands footage of the whole fight.

881
01:46:00,390 --> 01:46:10,199
Hold on, give me one sec. This guy was just spinning around with it. Uh, give me, let me,

882
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:21,239
let me add this. This is paused, right? Yep. We got a, we got a video from the stands here.

883
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:29,899
Make sure it's not too loud. Hold on. Where's the, there it is. Who are the audience members?

884
01:46:29,899 --> 01:46:34,779
The audience members were friends and family. Although some people were, uh, kind of, I guess,

885
01:46:34,779 --> 01:46:40,340
screened at the door and were allowed to come in eventually. So, but like we did have, we had

886
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:45,829
security at the doors and eventually it was like they were screened and they were like allowed to

887
01:46:45,829 --> 01:46:52,840
come in, I think is how it worked. But for the most part, people were not allowed in. But where,

888
01:46:52,840 --> 01:47:11,420
where are the, there it is. Okay. Okay. This, sorry. There's a black screen. That's my fault.

889
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:55,930
That's my fault. Here it is. Okay. So here is from the stands. That's insane. Yeah. I think at this

890
01:47:55,930 --> 01:48:01,699
point it was over. I think we, I think we, I think they cut out already here. Oh my God. He got all,

891
01:48:01,699 --> 01:48:12,279
oh my God. I didn't even see that. What? Oh my God. Holy shit. They all taking their clothes off.

892
01:48:12,279 --> 01:48:26,340
This wasn't even in the show. He got stuck in. Yeah. See, I got pied again. See, look at me.

893
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:38,699
I'm on the left over there. I got, I got another pie directly in the face. That's so funny. That's

894
01:48:38,699 --> 01:48:56,279
awesome. Uncensored. Shaving cream in the eyes. I lost my place here. Where was I? Can you guys

895
01:48:56,279 --> 01:49:06,060
help me here? We were much further than this. This is the beginning of the day. Close your

896
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:20,359
eyes for a second because it's going to be annoying to look at. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Close your

897
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:34,739
eyes. Like I'm serious. Like I don't want to annoy anybody. These pictures are awesome. Leather jacket

898
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:43,899
took these by the way. It's cool to have a leather jacket who's a mod was there. I think we were

899
01:49:43,899 --> 01:50:03,859
around here. It was after the cigarettes. It was right at the fight, right? Hold on. And here we,

900
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:12,970
and here we. Have you guys noticed that everybody that does a Joker impression now

901
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:18,819
does like a bunch of mouth sounds and that's, that's the impression. So let me tell you

902
01:50:18,819 --> 01:50:30,170
nothing. That's like, that's a Joker impression now. We can let it play from here. Yeah. If you

903
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:41,500
want to do a Joker impression, lean in. You see, we got to kill the Batman. And there's like, oh,

904
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:56,229
he did it. He did a, that's a good Joker. I love your new stash. It's probably not going to stay

905
01:50:56,229 --> 01:51:01,510
because it's really annoying. This kind of like sucks to have on if I'm honest, because my hair

906
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:08,949
is not full enough to be able to do it. So it's just these little spine wires stabbing into every

907
01:51:08,949 --> 01:51:20,460
section of my lip, like above here. I hate it. Also here, like I was saying, these pass by,

908
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:25,260
but again, here we are. This is in between an inning. This is while you guys are on commercial

909
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:31,510
break or while you're away. Here we are. How's it looking? How's this going? Look good. You got it.

910
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:34,149
You got to just start doing this. All right. I'm going to start doing that now. Okay. You do that

911
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:41,539
now. Okay. Go, go, go, go back. Keep the whiskers. You have to trim it. I know, but I'd say it's kind

912
01:51:41,539 --> 01:51:52,489
of annoying. I don't like it. But yeah, let me, let me figure out what the whole baseball stuff

913
01:51:52,489 --> 01:51:58,810
signing. Here we go. Okay. Yeah. We'll go from here because I did not expect that we're going

914
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:07,189
to go again that quickly. So let me talk to Jake and see what he says. Shave it off on stream. Nah,

915
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:14,520
nah, nah. I'm sorry that the internet is screwed up. It's not my internet. My internet is completely

916
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:21,539
fine. I promise you. It's just this bounce around. Yeah. I don't want to be a broken record. I don't

917
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:29,800
want to just run in circles, but I'm sorry that it's annoying right now. Nair it off. Oh no,

918
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:40,439
I already did the shaving bit. Yeah. Did I ever tell you about what didn't happen? I think I've

919
01:52:40,439 --> 01:52:46,710
probably talked about it. Okay. The, the hot air balloon thing to go from Boston to Vegas. I told

920
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:52,229
you guys that I wanted to find, but found footage that somebody had from like a dash cam of a bunch

921
01:52:52,229 --> 01:53:02,340
of crazy shit that happened up in the air. Did I ever tell you that? Like there was going to be a

922
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:06,739
dash cam on the hot air balloon. I was in front of a green screen, green, green screen going to

923
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:11,899
record a bunch of footage of just crazy shit happening up there. Like getting invaded by pirates

924
01:53:11,899 --> 01:53:15,739
and like eating people and shit. Like it was going to be nuts and it was going to be,

925
01:53:15,739 --> 01:53:20,380
oh dude, we like found this. Like this was a, some, some, some, some hot air balloon dash cam.

926
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:28,100
It's like lawless insanity up there, but I never recorded it. That never happened either. Oh no,

927
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:41,720
he's, they got him. They got him. They got, they cut ball boy with the big cartoon hammer. Oh my

928
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:49,560
God, what a mess. This sucks. No, yeah, that sucks. He's, that's the, here's the best part.

929
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:55,220
Right now he is going, oh fuck, fuck, fuck, ow, ow, ow. And he's like, hold on, man. Don't touch it.

930
01:53:55,220 --> 01:54:02,539
Don't touch it, man. Don't touch it, dude. Don't touch it. Don't touch it. I know what that's like.

931
01:54:02,539 --> 01:54:12,810
Yeah, I know what it's like. It sucks. And then, yeah, this is great. Once it was like, hey,

932
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:16,170
it's all good and done. This was, this is the coach for the magicians. It was joy handsome.

933
01:54:16,170 --> 01:54:26,979
No, it was a great time. It's real. I didn't get to see these. So this is really, I'm really happy

934
01:54:26,979 --> 01:54:40,489
about this. At this point, everyone's got their clothes off. Everyone's clothes are all off.

935
01:54:44,819 --> 01:55:00,390
The hat, the hair, like pulled back. These, these are fucking great. Oh my God. Holy shit.

936
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:22,979
Kookie the Clown. Kookie the Clown is, is fucking stacked. Holy shit. Whoa. This photo is fucking

937
01:55:22,979 --> 01:55:36,869
crazy. This photo is crazy. This is an insane photo. This is my favorite photo of the whole night.

938
01:55:36,869 --> 01:55:47,369
No wonder he snapped Dumbledore's neck. Awesome. Yeah, but these are all, so these are all the

939
01:55:47,369 --> 01:55:55,130
performers and the players. And if you go kind of like one by one here, you can kind of see,

940
01:55:55,130 --> 01:56:02,739
you remember who they were. They're such a great group. Truly a great group. I'm just ecstatic

941
01:56:02,739 --> 01:56:08,970
about it. They were so much fun. God, I feel like it's like, oh, remember when, remember when that

942
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:16,250
happened? Oh, you remember? This was like a week ago. I'm like, oh, remember? You remember? It was

943
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:27,300
like six days ago. Oh yeah. Everyone, there were a lot of like at the end of the night, like selfies

944
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:38,819
and stuff. Look at this fucking mustache. And everyone's saying, dude, why do you make the same

945
01:56:38,819 --> 01:56:46,069
face in every photo? I don't know. You make different faces in your, if it's like, hey,

946
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:51,260
let's get a picture. It's like, I don't like make, I just like, this is, that's my take a photo face.

947
01:56:51,260 --> 01:57:02,890
It's just like, is that weird? You saw the post? Of course I saw the post. I always make the same,

948
01:57:02,890 --> 01:57:06,729
yeah, you make like this, because you know why you make the same face in every single photo?

949
01:57:06,729 --> 01:57:11,699
Because you know exactly what that face looks like. If you change it up, right, if you like,

950
01:57:11,699 --> 01:57:18,500
you practice that take a photo face, like, okay, you change that up. I don't know what the fuck

951
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:22,420
that looks like. I have no idea what that looks like. I'm not doing that. I have no idea what I

952
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:26,489
look like. I might look like a crazy, I might look like a fucking weirdo. I might be like,

953
01:57:26,489 --> 01:57:30,979
I might look crazed. No, you have the one face that you know exactly what it looks like and you do

954
01:57:30,979 --> 01:57:42,060
it every time. Too much teeth. Yeah. Too much teeth. It's like, or too little teeth is like,

955
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:58,069
no, I got it down. It's nice lifeless eyes. It's a photo. I'm sorry. I'm not like, what do you want?

956
01:57:58,550 --> 01:58:05,609
It's a, you're taking a picture. And by the way, the fire breathing,

957
01:58:05,609 --> 01:58:09,670
didn't think there was going to be a fire breather on that stream. You didn't think

958
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:14,069
there was going to be a legit guy breathing fucking flames out of his mouth for like five

959
01:58:14,069 --> 01:58:23,460
straight minutes. But yeah, that's the photos and it was awesome. I'm glad I got to share that.

960
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:33,670
Special huge thanks to Leather Jacket. Leather Jacket came out here and did all this. Big shout

961
01:58:33,670 --> 01:58:51,720
out to Leather Jacket for this. And that was the show. That was the baseball show. Tell us about

962
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:58,060
the guy whose pants caught on fire. Uh, the guy whose pants caught on fire. What do you mean?

963
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:36,090
Hold on. Let me see. Who's pants caught on fire? Let me see. I mean, that's a trained professional,

964
01:59:36,090 --> 01:59:43,720
but you know, sometimes you get, I mean that, that, that, that's, this is, this is a trained

965
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:57,180
professional. You know what he's doing. He's good. He knows he's done. We're good. Multi-talented.

966
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:07,260
Yeah. When the fire breather was going, like he was taking his fingers and splitting the fire.

967
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:19,189
So the fire was just coming out of two different sides. Just BAM! Boom! Boom! Would you ever do

968
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:25,750
director's commentary over one of your big streams? Um, I think stuff like this is good.

969
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:33,859
Showing like some clips and pictures and stuff. But I, I do, I really like the, the notion that

970
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:37,699
you don't get to really know everything. I'd rather you guys not know every single detail

971
02:00:37,699 --> 02:00:45,529
because it's more fun that way. This kind of is that. Yeah. This is it right now. But I don't,

972
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:49,449
I don't want to, you know, line by line after everything that happens, pause and be like,

973
02:00:49,449 --> 02:00:56,520
so this is how that happened. I'd rather have at least a little bit of magic and mystery behind

974
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:05,029
it. Right? How many people were not actually baseball players, but just performers? Uh,

975
02:01:05,029 --> 02:01:15,180
I believe we had 11, no, 14 people that were not baseball players and 22 or 23 or 24. I think there

976
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:23,880
were 24 baseball players and we were just kind of putting them, cycling them in and out. You told

977
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:32,090
us it was rigged. Yeah, but I didn't say how much of it was. Did you do like a big party or anything

978
02:01:32,090 --> 02:01:43,460
after the event? No. I mean, the show ended on, um, the show went till what? Like midnight Eastern,

979
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:48,920
1 a.m. Eastern is when it really turned off. So it's not like, oh, hey guys, it's like

980
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,590
midnight. It's time to go to dinner. And I was like, everyone was tired. Like this,

981
02:01:53,590 --> 02:02:01,130
get some good rest. Uh, take care of yourselves. It wasn't really anything else really going on.

982
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:10,119
Exhausted. Yeah, probably exhausted. Talk about the man on the ball. It's a performer. Every time

983
02:02:10,119 --> 02:02:14,409
you saw somebody do something like this, they, that was, that was a performer that has a lot of

984
02:02:14,409 --> 02:02:25,000
experience in, you know, acrobatics, um, tricks, juggling, uh, circus type performances. They can

985
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:31,079
move around really quickly. Uh, very animated. They were awesome. Anytime that you saw something

986
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:39,899
like that happen, it was one of these guys. One of the magicians commented on my fan art. That's

987
02:02:39,899 --> 02:02:52,180
awesome. Yeah, I've seen on Twitter, they've been tweeting stuff out. That makes me happy.

988
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:58,039
That means they had, that means they had fun. It'd be one thing if they were, okay. So if they,

989
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:02,680
if nobody said anything after the show, if it was like, oh, thank you. That was so much fun. Yeah.

990
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:08,739
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. And then everyone was dead silent afterwards. Nobody said anything. We never

991
02:03:08,739 --> 02:03:14,810
heard from any of the players ever again. It'd be like, oh, I hope they was, whatever. That's a good

992
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:30,260
sign that they were tweeting out pictures. What about the bunny? Oh, the bunny trick. Yeah. I

993
02:03:30,260 --> 02:03:34,680
didn't even know that. I didn't even know that was going to happen. He did like a, he did like a,

994
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:46,300
a rabbit trick. We pulled a rabbit out of a hat. I was like, holy shit, that's really happening.

995
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:52,229
It's too bad because that was right. We were having the most kind of internet issues at that

996
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:58,260
exact moment. So he did a whole trick and we really only got to see kind of the end of it.

997
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:08,329
Did you know the commentators from somewhere? They're amazing. They were a connection to

998
02:04:08,329 --> 02:04:14,659
somebody on the production team. So somebody on the production team had a contact to,

999
02:04:14,659 --> 02:04:18,579
because they do actual broadcast baseball. They do, I think, college games and minor league games,

1000
02:04:18,579 --> 02:04:29,930
I think. They live and breathe that. We got real broadcasters. That's what they do.

1001
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:41,770
Were you actually frustrated during the event or was it an act? Yeah, it's part of the gig,

1002
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:51,739
right? I mean, it's part of the fun. I was actually, there was a point where I was genuinely upset

1003
02:04:51,739 --> 02:04:56,060
and it was when I got in my ear for the first time that we were like dropping frames.

1004
02:04:56,060 --> 02:05:08,819
And I was just like, nowhere we can't be, right? So I was a little pissed off at that point.

1005
02:05:08,819 --> 02:05:15,189
After another inning went by, they turned it off, changed servers, went back to normal.

1006
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:23,880
Not another problem the entire rest of the night. So I went from like being annoyed to, oh, thank

1007
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,279
God, thank God that like the last two hours of the show was fine. Thank goodness it's not,

1008
02:05:28,279 --> 02:05:31,319
because one of the things I was really concerned about when we started actually having those

1009
02:05:31,319 --> 02:05:36,329
internet like ingest whatever they were problems, there was a loud fuck on stream at one point.

1010
02:05:36,329 --> 02:05:43,609
Oh, that was fake. Yeah, that was early on. Oh, the fuck, the loud fuck. I know exactly

1011
02:05:43,609 --> 02:05:52,779
what you're talking about. Do we have a clip? Fuck. Yeah. Yep. No, that was fake. That was

1012
02:05:52,779 --> 02:06:00,630
before we even started having problems. That was, I remember trying to make it real. And I think

1013
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:09,060
yeah, that was definitely not real. That was like in the second inning. I was only irritated from

1014
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:15,020
the bottom of the fourth inning to the top of the sixth inning, because I knew we were having a

1015
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:26,170
bunch of problems up in the truck. But from what I have been told, it was okay. Some points were

1016
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:31,420
kind of bad, but it was watchable for a lot of that, like the fourth and fifth inning,

1017
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:37,270
from what I've been told. It was like, okay. It sounded authentic. Let me see.

1018
02:06:37,270 --> 02:07:22,890
Okay, I say that's out, that's out. Oh my God, that was violent.

1019
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:28,260
What? Oh, it's because I got the pie in the face. It was from the, because I got hit with the pie

1020
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:44,920
and I'm irritated. I'm like throwing some people out. Oh, yeah. On top of it. Polka dot.

1021
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,720
Apologize for the language. Our effects, Mike, sometimes picks up some.

1022
02:07:49,529 --> 02:07:57,260
Okay, that's actually funny. That's actually really funny. No, I was not actually mad. I was,

1023
02:07:57,260 --> 02:08:02,359
I mean, I guess I was supposed to be, because this is right after the pie. And this, I threw

1024
02:08:02,359 --> 02:08:09,029
out like three people. Explain what happens here. So they're going to give second base to Smith

1025
02:08:09,029 --> 02:08:15,500
and run another run scored. I do believe so it should be five, nothing run scores. Albertson

1026
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:27,800
confirms right on top of it. Do the people in the stands must've thought I was insane

1027
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:32,039
because I remember I was turned toward the audience and I like screamed it out like towards

1028
02:08:32,039 --> 02:08:53,289
the audience. All four of them. You imagine? Super aggressive. Oh, it sounded like a stock

1029
02:08:53,289 --> 02:08:59,880
sound effect. Why did I do that? I don't, I don't know, because I figured it was appropriate to

1030
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:13,739
yell that. Cause I'm, I don't know. I feel like it was appropriate. Who was the fan you kicked out?

1031
02:09:13,739 --> 02:09:19,619
Oh, I forget what they were saying. They were saying something. It was, what were they saying?

1032
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:23,460
Oh, it was something so specific and I can't remember it, but it was, they said it like

1033
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:32,090
five or six times behind me. And wasn't there a seven year old there? I mean,

1034
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:53,989
I mean, I, I don't know. Somebody said you're closer to the ground than I am. How could you

1035
02:09:53,989 --> 02:10:01,300
have missed that? That's probably what it was. That's probably what it was. Family friendly.

1036
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:06,819
Well, no, we did tell, okay, we did tell everybody that was going to come, that this was a comedy.

1037
02:10:06,819 --> 02:10:13,500
This was like a, I like a potential R rated comedy routine. We did say that. We did say this

1038
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:24,569
was a comedy show. This is a comedy show. And Fansly was the sponsor. You should have thrown out the

1039
02:10:24,569 --> 02:10:30,949
seven year old. That's probably, I don't know. What do you want me to say? Did you have fun?

1040
02:10:30,949 --> 02:10:36,520
Yeah, it was fucking awesome. You kicked out the seven year old. No, I did not. I did not kick out

1041
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:41,960
anybody that was, they, unless they were yelling things at me and I threw them out. And the person

1042
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:47,640
that I threw out is they knew it was a joke and they didn't think it was serious. You're a bad

1043
02:10:47,640 --> 02:11:13,720
influence. You missed, when the mascot started fighting, the kid's dad picks him up. Uh, it's

1044
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:34,600
real? That's real. No way. No way. Actually real. Actually real. So you're telling me at this point

1045
02:11:34,600 --> 02:11:45,180
where the mascots are fighting and a little kid gets picked up. All right. Well, whatever. I,

1046
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:56,970
do you, that, I didn't, I got nothing to do with that. Remember we were at PAX East 2018. This

1047
02:11:56,970 --> 02:12:01,449
little 10 year old with his dad approached you and said he was a big fan and I could just see

1048
02:12:01,449 --> 02:12:06,329
the shock on your face because he definitely shouldn't have been watching you. Yeah, I remember

1049
02:12:06,329 --> 02:12:27,020
that. Hey, Wendy, listen, when you come to this stream, you have to click a button. You have to,

1050
02:12:27,020 --> 02:12:31,399
you have to click a button. That button says something very specific. What does it say?

1051
02:12:31,399 --> 02:12:39,210
This broadcast is intended for mature audiences. Okay. You have to click that button. And look,

1052
02:12:39,210 --> 02:12:48,630
I can't, I cannot stop somebody from coming here. If somebody is not like 18 and they're,

1053
02:12:48,630 --> 02:12:53,270
oh, this is a mature stream. It's 18. Oh, it's at least, at least, you know, at least you gotta be

1054
02:12:53,270 --> 02:13:00,859
at least certain age. I can't look into this screen and see fucking how old you are. This

1055
02:13:00,859 --> 02:13:15,560
broadcast is for clowns only. Look, I will say this. I hope it comes off as, I hope it comes off

1056
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:21,859
this way. Look, listen, listen to me. Look, listen, listen, listen, listen to me. Okay. Hear me out.

1057
02:13:21,859 --> 02:13:26,630
Listen to me. That's how you know about to start talking. That's how, okay. Oh, hey, hey, is Jeremy

1058
02:13:26,630 --> 02:13:31,210
going to start talking? Oh, hear me out. Listen to me for a sec. That's like before every sentence

1059
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:37,930
I've ever said. Okay. But listen to me for real. I try to have this stream be a fun place. It's,

1060
02:13:37,930 --> 02:13:43,109
I try to be like positive about shit. I try not to be like doing anything too bad or fucked up.

1061
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:47,189
You know what I mean? Like I try to have it be like a decent moments for, I try to have it be fun.

1062
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:59,800
It doesn't show the fight. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You look like

1063
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:07,529
dad about to give me the talk. All right. But listen, I'm a little crass, but I genuinely want

1064
02:14:07,529 --> 02:14:16,890
people to leave this stream with like, oh, I had fun, right? That's it. I cannot control who is here.

1065
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:26,250
I can't. All I can do is put the warnings up, right? But whatever. You know what? Whatever.

1066
02:14:26,250 --> 02:14:35,319
What do you want me to say? I'm wearing the Jek shirt because I feel fucking strong today.

1067
02:14:35,319 --> 02:14:40,039
How are babies made? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I've been trying to figure it out

1068
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:46,899
for years. A bird flies in and drops it off like a big stork comes into your window. I still don't

1069
02:14:46,899 --> 02:15:08,220
understand. I don't know. There's no more. I've used it all. I've used all of it. Not this,

1070
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:18,970
not just today. All right. So what are the questions we got? Any more questions for me?

1071
02:15:18,970 --> 02:15:24,600
We've been here for like two and a half hours. Holy shit. You do no more coke? I don't do drugs

1072
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:36,439
besides marijuana. It's the only one. And maybe alcohol every four or five months. Are you going

1073
02:15:36,439 --> 02:15:49,590
to go to TwitchCon? I don't think so. I do not have a plan to go to TwitchCon. Are you going to

1074
02:15:49,590 --> 02:16:07,779
stream Spyro 2? No, I'm not. Did you add anything to the Reddit shelf? There is going to be something

1075
02:16:07,779 --> 02:16:11,979
on the Reddit shelf. There's a baseball up there now, but it's just there temporarily. What is

1076
02:16:11,979 --> 02:16:17,979
going to go up there is the umpire mask. I've got to clean it up though. It's still kind of disgusting.

1077
02:16:17,979 --> 02:16:22,840
So the umpire mask is going to go up on the shelf somewhere. That's going to be added to the Reddit

1078
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:41,139
shelf. You're going to stream Slime Rancher 2? Yes. 100%. Are you on Push to Talk? Nope. Oh yeah.

1079
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:49,379
The new trophies came in for the streamer awards. Can you see them? You can see them

1080
02:16:49,379 --> 02:16:55,739
right next to each other. Look at how much bigger than they are. Cutie sent out replacements for the

1081
02:16:55,739 --> 02:17:05,059
ones. They're awesome. Yeah, those things are unbelievable. They grew in size. I gotta move

1082
02:17:05,059 --> 02:17:21,260
some stuff around on the red shelf. You gonna do another infomercial stream? Well, maybe. Since all

1083
02:17:21,260 --> 02:17:32,899
the game-used baseballs are gone, can you replace them with the ass-used ones? Can we see your next

1084
02:17:32,899 --> 02:17:52,899
big show live? I mean, here's... Why is everybody omega-lulling? What happened? Why are people

1085
02:17:52,899 --> 02:18:00,969
omega-lulling? What's going on? There's a lot of omega-lulls and I don't know why. What's happening?

1086
02:18:00,969 --> 02:18:12,950
Why did you read that? Read what? What did I read? What did I do? The asshole ball thing. Oh. Oh,

1087
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:25,020
I mean, that was a delayed omega-lull reaction. How much would that sell for? I'm just thinking,

1088
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:30,309
remember, you clicked mature audience right when you fucking came here. What would that sell for?

1089
02:18:30,309 --> 02:18:37,670
What would that actually sell for if it was a fucking open auction? Open auction? No. It was

1090
02:18:37,670 --> 02:18:49,020
open for like a month. You think that would go for more than... Do you think that would go for more

1091
02:18:49,020 --> 02:19:02,299
than $10,000? What is this? What's in mod chat right now? Germa F? What is this? What sound

1092
02:19:02,299 --> 02:19:20,090
effect is this? At most $60,000 minimum. No, it would not. I would pay $2,000 unironically.

1093
02:19:20,809 --> 02:19:30,809
Oh, really? Really? Germa's ass baseball would pay $2,000 for this baseball. Judging by that,

1094
02:19:30,809 --> 02:19:42,260
the fact that that's your username, I would imagine that would be a lot higher. So you're telling me

1095
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:49,139
that if I sold... Like, let's... You say I could get 50 fucking grand for each one of these. Are

1096
02:19:49,139 --> 02:19:57,510
you shitting me? So if I just... If I sold 10 ass baseballs for half a million dollars, are you

1097
02:19:57,510 --> 02:20:21,510
kidding me? What an investment? What the fuck? Oh, man. I really need to find sponsors. These shows

1098
02:20:21,510 --> 02:20:26,069
are really expensive. Oh, yeah. I signed with Evolves. They're going to be doing a bunch of

1099
02:20:26,069 --> 02:20:31,670
sponsorships. It's today's sponsor stream. Oh, tomorrow. Yeah, I got sponsored by this. But

1100
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:48,250
put 10 baseballs up your ass and pay for every fucking show. Really? Really? Do 10 to 20

1101
02:20:48,250 --> 02:20:54,860
baseballs and you have the budget for the next fucking year or two of shows. Really, guys? Are

1102
02:20:54,860 --> 02:21:12,059
you kidding me? Really? Are you serious with me? It's that easy. Can you imagine the articles? Oh,

1103
02:21:13,819 --> 02:21:21,340
E-Clown live streamer Jeremy Elbertson decides to actually, actually have his Fansley account

1104
02:21:21,340 --> 02:21:26,620
where he's selling shoved baseballs up his ass to do what he loves. And that's put on the next

1105
02:21:26,620 --> 02:21:51,479
big stream and it's going to cover everything. What the hell? Ball Fondler was right. No,

1106
02:21:51,479 --> 02:21:55,079
that's never going to happen. I'm just saying, I'm just making the argument to,

1107
02:21:57,659 --> 02:22:04,299
I just have to put 10 baseballs near my ass and I would have enough money to do anything.

1108
02:22:04,299 --> 02:22:10,520
Like, what the fuck? Oh, we really got to figure out how we're going to pay for this show.

1109
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:15,159
I get on the phone with Community Jake. Yep. Okay. It's going to cost this. This is going to cost

1110
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:18,440
this. Well, if we really want to get that, it's going to cost this. That's a lot of fucking money.

1111
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:21,559
Okay. Yeah, it's going to go. How are we going to have to reach out to some sponsors? That's going

1112
02:22:21,639 --> 02:22:25,319
to take months. It's going to take months. It's going to take months of back and forth figuring

1113
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:34,010
it out. Or 10 baseballs up your ass, Jeremy. I don't know why that, I actually don't know if

1114
02:22:34,010 --> 02:22:40,229
that's been on the ground. I actually, that may have, that actually may have fallen on the ground.

1115
02:22:40,229 --> 02:22:45,530
I don't know why I did that. That was probably, I'm going to brush my, I'm going to brush my teeth.

1116
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:49,770
I'll be back in a minute. I'll be back in one minute. I'm actually just going to wash my mouth.

1117
02:22:49,770 --> 02:25:44,229
That's kind of gross, but I'm good. That's gross. But yeah, what were we, what were we saying? What

1118
02:25:44,229 --> 02:25:53,139
were we talking about? How much for that chapstick? No, we're not, we're not doing this anymore. I need

1119
02:25:53,139 --> 02:25:57,590
to get away from this topic. We're not doing this anymore. Yeah, I should have just moved on. I

1120
02:25:57,590 --> 02:26:03,510
should have came back and moved on. But isn't that insane to think about that? All the meetings,

1121
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:11,610
the dozens of meetings, dozens of them, figuring out how to pay for this show, dozens of them,

1122
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:15,530
different going, trying to find like, you know, the meetings and okay, like, let's go, let's go,

1123
02:26:15,530 --> 02:26:20,870
let's get down to business here. It's like, sometimes you think you're just like, what the

1124
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:32,250
fuck, man? Good salad. All right. I was going to maybe do something. I think I'm probably going

1125
02:26:32,250 --> 02:26:40,299
to call the stream here because for a couple things. One, I didn't think I was going to sit

1126
02:26:40,299 --> 02:26:44,149
here for more than two or three hours. So I'm here for two and a half hours. There's a couple

1127
02:26:44,149 --> 02:26:47,590
things that I, with the baseball show in particular that I need, there's some loose ends I want to

1128
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:54,979
tie up. There's a couple things I need to do here to get prepared and kind of tie up with the show.

1129
02:26:54,979 --> 02:27:01,000
I know like there was one stream a week, Andy. I know it's been like that at least the last week

1130
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:09,959
since the show, but I'm not quite ready to come back, but I did want to do this. Just another

1131
02:27:09,959 --> 02:27:14,440
day or two. That's not going to be long. And then here's the thing. This next show that I'm talking

1132
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:21,260
about is at least two or three months away. So we're going to go back to normal to about the

1133
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:25,899
end of the year. So we're just back to kind of normal, just chilling out, playing games,

1134
02:27:25,899 --> 02:27:32,360
messing around. Regular streams are going to come back. We'll go back to normal and then another

1135
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:42,620
few months, we'll be back at it again, doing the same shit. Only this one, I don't even know.

1136
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:46,219
I genuinely don't even know what's going to happen because I had an idea of what was going to happen

1137
02:27:46,219 --> 02:27:53,610
with this show and even with Dollhouse. But this one coming up, guys, I have no fucking idea.

1138
02:27:53,610 --> 02:28:01,000
It's going to be fun though. I hope so. But yeah, also keep an eye out for Grotto Beast. Grotto Beast

1139
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:08,100
is coming very soon. I want that to be available for the holiday season. So keep an eye out.

1140
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:13,379
Twitter, keep an eye out. Here, keep an eye on the sus to find out what the next stream is going to

1141
02:28:13,379 --> 02:28:19,239
be. I tell you, it's probably going to be on Monday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We'll go three days

1142
02:28:19,239 --> 02:28:29,299
in a row because I've been away for so long. Yeah, thanks for watching. I know that a lot of people

1143
02:28:29,299 --> 02:28:34,469
you put up with a lot of the technical issues kind of in the middle. And thanks for sticking

1144
02:28:34,469 --> 02:28:38,760
around. I know it's really easy to leave a stream like that when there's problems,

1145
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:43,930
but thanks for sticking with it. And it was an incredible night. It was a really fun day.

1146
02:28:43,930 --> 02:28:50,409
I'm just sad that it's over in a way. I'm sad that it's like all these like kind of new friends

1147
02:28:50,409 --> 02:28:55,399
and acquaintances. It was a great feeling and I'm really happy that it went over well. And I'm

1148
02:28:55,399 --> 02:29:02,229
really happy that people had a good time. So thank you again for watching. Thanks for the support.

1149
02:29:02,229 --> 02:29:10,200
And yeah, we'll see you on the next one. I'll see you guys on Monday. Monday, we're going back to

1150
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:17,579
regular streaming. So I'll put a poll in the chat of a game. Pac-Man World Remake came out.

1151
02:29:17,579 --> 02:29:26,420
Very important. Pac-Man Remake is out. I think I have to check that out. Cult of the Lamb. I still

1152
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:32,709
want to play that. Sorcery Part 3. We still have to get through Part 3. There's quite a bit to do.

1153
02:29:32,709 --> 02:29:43,239
I'm a little bit behind. Yeah, Pac-Man World got a remaster of some kind. It's on Steam now.

1154
02:29:43,239 --> 02:29:52,180
Multi Versus. I'm going back to Multi Versus. There's a lot to do. So on Monday, you'll figure

1155
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:55,379
that out. We'll start at the same time. Two o'clock. I want to get back to this 2 p.m. Pacific

1156
02:29:55,379 --> 02:30:04,760
schedule. And yeah, we'll make a photos command to link to the photo album. Okay, cool. Yeah.

1157
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:10,200
So that Leather Jackets photo album, this will be available to go check out. It'll be the

1158
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:19,959
exclamation point photos. But yeah, I'll be back on Monday. 2 p.m. Pacific. Thanks a lot, guys.

1159
02:30:19,959 --> 02:30:29,239
Have a great rest of your day. Great rest of your night. And with that, I'm going to leave it.

1160
02:30:29,239 --> 02:30:34,069
Quick one, but I wanted just to kind of come and catch up. I didn't want to wait too long. I wanted

1161
02:30:34,069 --> 02:30:47,049
to do a little bit of a debrief for the stream, too. Get some more chapstick. I got plenty. I got

1162
02:30:47,049 --> 02:31:01,290
a lot. What about modded Skyrim? Oh yeah, there was. I was going to do the modded Skyrim and use a

1163
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:08,379
Ghost Commander's tool. Yeah, I just got to get back into the saddle here. I've been in baseball

1164
02:31:08,379 --> 02:31:13,180
mode for the last like two weeks. I just kind of got over it three, two, three days ago. So

1165
02:31:13,180 --> 02:31:21,540
I kind of have to get back into it. Signed baseballs are restocked. German985.com if you

1166
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:32,200
want one. Keep an eye on it. There might be a second restock available for those non in-game

1167
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:40,600
but souvenir kind of balls. I think we are probably fresh out of the... I'm imagining we're out of the

1168
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:50,459
game balls at this point. Justice for Ball Fondler. He didn't do anything wrong. You must have missed

1169
02:31:50,459 --> 02:31:56,500
the memo. Ball Fondler has been unbanned. He got unbanned at the end of this stream. At the end of

1170
02:31:56,500 --> 02:32:08,920
baseball, he was unbanned. Ball Fondler is among us. There's more game balls. I know that when I

1171
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:15,049
talked to Jake about the merch last, they tracked down some other game balls that were used in the

1172
02:32:15,049 --> 02:32:18,649
game that they didn't have inventory of on the website. So I'll talk to him again. I'll get some

1173
02:32:18,649 --> 02:32:35,540
more answers here. But keep an eye on the site. And with that, I'll see you guys Monday. Take care

1174
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:47,959
of yourselves. It's good to be back. Have a great night. Have a great day. See you soon. See you real

1175
02:32:47,959 --> 02:32:54,040
Monday. Goodbye. Good night.
