1
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:11,449
Hey Fred. Hey Fred. What's up? How you doing? You doing good? How you been? You've been good?

2
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:23,769
Hey dude, can you play Elden Ring? I already beat Elden Ring. That was good. I know I said I was

3
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:33,259
going to do something else with Elden Ring, but I didn't do it. Me strong let's play did not happen.

4
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:47,079
Yeah, what is it? They have to, there's no way the DLC does not get announced

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:54,070
in the next few months, right? They definitely have DLC that's planned for next year,

6
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:01,960
right? Like 2023. It has to be. It has to be. How long did it take from Dark Souls 3,

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:13,340
from launch to the first DLC? A year? Year and a half? When are you going to do the axe

8
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:32,140
self-defense class? Play Lost Ark. Hey, can you start being EU friendly for streams? I don't

9
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,620
live in the EU, but I get up before the sun, so can you change your whole schedule to benefit me?

10
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:52,060
No, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry about that. Hey, can you do EU streams? I don't live in the EU,

11
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:02,840
but do it anyways. All right, we got some stuff to talk about. Things to go over. First of all,

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:14,569
let's go over what's going on this week. Okay, stop. This week, today, we got sorcery. Tomorrow,

13
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:21,050
probably sorcery. Thursday, hmm, something, something happening. Something happening on

14
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,050
Thursday. I won't tell you what, but I think something's going on on Thursday. You might

15
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:40,259
find very interesting. We'll see. We'll see. I'm very excited for it. We'll see. And then Saturday,

16
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:51,909
I'm going to tell you right now, Saturday is the day for Green Screen Part 2. I don't know

17
00:02:51,909 --> 00:03:06,860
if I can even talk. Hold on, let me see. Yeah, okay. So it is happening on Thursday. I'll let

18
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,699
you know maybe in a little bit, because I don't know if it's been talked about yet.

19
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:27,370
So maybe. Maybe I'll talk about it. Is it a poetry night? No. Yeah, so let me tell you that I've been

20
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,620
feeling a little under the weather in a colitis flare. I'm having problems once a year or so.

21
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,780
This happens. It comes back maybe a couple times a year. And I don't feel fantastic. I don't feel

22
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,099
great. So we're going to do more streams this week, but less time. So we'll do like three or

23
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:52,180
four hours today, three or four hours tomorrow, however long the thing on Thursday is. And then

24
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,300
obviously the Green Screen movie night will be about four-ish, five-ish hours. So we'll do more

25
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:07,030
days, but less time this week. So we'll do about three days in a row here and then Saturday. So

26
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:20,470
should be good. Now where? Oh, where did this go? There. All right. So we left off in sorcery.

27
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:31,750
It's 11 p.m. here. I mean, hey, when you spin, the globe is big and the globe has lots of time

28
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:50,100
zones on it. 11 p.m. Where are you in? Germany? Green Screen movie night part two will be Saturday.

29
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:58,180
And we're going to do it Saturday night. Saturday night. Saturday at like 4 p.m. 5 p.m. Pacific.

30
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:07,319
Saturday night. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. Very cool. All right. You guys ready?

31
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,420
Shall we continue our story? It's been like a week, so let's refresh people what we're doing.

32
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:19,560
Where we were. Some things we did. I'll put the camera on. I hope it's not.

33
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:31,779
Hey, it's not. All right. Good. All right. So we left off. We were here at the halls of Vlada.

34
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,600
We still have the ape as the god. We'll give you a little look at where we were. Remember, we were

35
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,699
in this house here. We got chased through the alleys. We went across the document where I was

36
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,939
in the water. I almost drowned three times. Remember before that, we were through here

37
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:58,579
in the artist's quarter. The giant stomped on that guy's carpet stall and I burnt the whole

38
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:04,600
place down, I think. And then we rewound and I did it normally. Would you ever try psychedelics? No.

39
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:16,379
No, I'm too fucked up already. Like I've had this conversation about drugs before. I'm not. I don't

40
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:25,180
condone drugs like that. I can't do them. I would never do them. I would never try them. Ever. No

41
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,699
way. Too much. Way too much. And I think it is too much, right? You know, if you smoke marijuana,

42
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:38,629
you know, you have a few beers, right? Cool. But like, it's too much after that. Anything

43
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:57,180
after that's too much. At least that's my opinion on the whole thing. Remember, nobody believes you.

44
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,100
That's fine. I don't need to prove to anybody that I don't do crack. All I can tell you is,

45
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,259
guys, I don't do crack. I don't believe you. I don't care. That's fine. I don't care. I don't

46
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:14,949
give a shit if you don't believe me that I don't do crack. I don't have to like get on stage in

47
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,199
front of 20, 30,000 people and sit there and go, guys, I don't do crack. I promise. They're just

48
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:27,300
booing. Boo, you fucking liar. I just have to sit there and go, that's fine. You are free to believe

49
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,709
whatever you want. That's the whole show and then the curtain comes down. All right. So here we are

50
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:40,310
now. This is what it looks like. We're going down here. We're trying to get the poem for the door.

51
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,910
I'll show you the clues, which by the way, you can't even hear anything, but now you can.

52
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:54,220
Let's open up the, let's take a look what we got. Let's get that music going. All right. So we have

53
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:01,139
a lot of beeswax, a skull cap, two doses of blimberry juice, a bamboo flute, eight goblin

54
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,300
teeth, a giant's tooth, green haired wig, bracelet, a bone and a sun jewel. We've got a lot of items.

55
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:21,339
I still have my standard sword and here are the clues. North spell gate. Remember the North gate

56
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:26,060
requires a spell made of four lines. Without the lines, you will not be able to leave the city port.

57
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:41,590
The fifth noble, Shinva. Lord Shinva is the fifth noble. Korga. Remember this?

58
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,259
The ritual of Korga involves his three eyes, the left eye, right eye and the third eye.

59
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:54,490
I don't get a puke. If you don't, okay. I got it. Let me give a refresher on sorcery. Sorcery is a

60
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:05,179
choose your own adventure game. It's back in like the 1960s, 1970s by Steve Jackson. It is a fantastic

61
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,259
experience. One of the greatest, one of my favorite games of all time. We're doing it again because I

62
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:15,159
passed a million followers. So where are we going? Are we going to go through the arch? Are we going

63
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:22,940
to go to the halls of Vlada or are we going to go to the left port? It's up to you. Remember the game

64
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,179
is from 2013. Yes, and it's the first game that I streamed on Twitch. I passed a million followers,

65
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:41,029
so we're doing it again. This I believe is the gambling hall. The last thing we did was the

66
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,059
statue. I think I can show you. You go over to the statue, look at the pot, it seems to contain 20

67
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:53,460
gold pieces. We didn't take any money from this. People wanted me to, but I said no. I said no.

68
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:05,750
Keep rubbing it in my face that you had a million followers. Well, what do you mean?

69
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:16,179
That's what I'm doing. All right, let's get a poll. Any mods around or should I hop in the

70
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:28,730
chat and do it? I can hop in the chat and do it if I need to. Would you ever do an IRL gambling

71
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:43,539
stream while I'm doing a poll? All right, so we're going to go. This is one, two and three.

72
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:59,720
Keep that in mind. One, two and three. Here we go. Oh, a poll is already active. Oh, shit.

73
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,639
You didn't say no. I, whatever. I didn't say anything. You said that. I didn't say shit.

74
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:18,519
Remember one, two and three. Through the arch. One. The halls of Vlada. Two. The left fork.

75
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:42,330
And we are going to two. Here we go. Oh, do I still have my voices? Let's see. Does this work?

76
00:11:42,330 --> 00:12:14,389
Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.

00:13:44,330 --> 00:14:21,460
Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.

80
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,460
And a bristly innkeeper are waiting to play.

81
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:33,360
We went all in. Oops.

82
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,120
Alright, so let's look at the tables.

83
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
First of all, oh how? What's going on here.

84
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,330
Crazy

85
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,289
The tables are arranged in different sections by the size of the bet and the number of dice to be played

86
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:54,340
Sad looking creatures move down from high stakes tables to lower ones

87
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,940
Brassy and bold creatures move up

88
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,440
At the two chip tables are the old man in the sailor

89
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,299
At the table with the ten chip bet, the innkeeper is waiting to play

90
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:07,029
The old man in the sailor have just finished a game

91
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,370
The old man must have won

92
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,360
because he stands, cracks his knuckles, and moves to the five-piece table.

93
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,039
The sailor ships down to the table with the five-chip wager.

94
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,309
It's the same innkeeper? Um, I don't know, it might be.

95
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,120
Cash out.

96
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,840
All right, that was fun.

97
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,320
I've, I've moved him around in my hands for a few minutes.

98
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,039
I'm out of here.

99
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:40,389
Uh, let's just, hold on, let's wait and watch.

100
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,639
You sit back and watch for a while.

101
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
The players on the tables form themselves into pairs,

102
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,159
and settle down to play in deathly silence.

103
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,509
The rattle of dice fills the hall like a clash of swords in a barrack room.

104
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:57,720
Nearby, on the five-stake table, the old man and the sailor finish a tens game.

105
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,679
Sailor must have won because he stands up, barks a laugh,

106
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,240
and moves to the table with the ten-chip stake.

107
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,879
The old man shifts down to the cheap table.

108
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,000
How many chips does the old man have?

109
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,679
I feel like this is a fucking math question in a math book.

110
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:19,159
How many chips did the old man come in with?

111
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:22,440
Okay, uh, the spin lady leaves the booth at the front of the hall

112
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,820
and makes a circuit of the room,

113
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,379
offering refreshments at the cost of four gambling chips.

114
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:35,940
The burly innkeeper buys two rolled-up flatbreads and devours them without looking.

115
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,240
That's four gold.

116
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,009
All right, I'll do it.

117
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,129
You buy a hill fox thigh and eat it quickly.

118
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,320
Someone curses from the back of the hall, but no one seems to notice.

119
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,600
All right, let's, should I pick a table?

120
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,480
Are we going to the big bet?

121
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
Or what, what are we doing for bets?

122
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,799
Should I just keep waiting?

123
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,539
Maybe, maybe a fight will break out.

124
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:04,579
Should I just cash out after watching the fight?

125
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,460
It's gonna be a fight, right?

126
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,599
It has to be.

127
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,099
You stand back and watch the players.

128
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,779
Over on the tables with the 10 chip bet,

129
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:13,779
the sailor and the innkeeper have played each other.

130
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:19,000
The sailor shifts down to the medium table.

131
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,309
All right, all right, pick a table.

132
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,839
At one end, games are being played for stakes as low as two.

133
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,519
Uh, at the other end, players are betting 20 on each game.

134
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,339
Most tables also offer long games with four or five dice each,

135
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,740
alongside shorter two or three dice games.

136
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,809
But not all the tables have players ready to play.

137
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,430
You look across the tables.

138
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,670
At the table with the two chip wagers, the old man.

139
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,190
At the five piece table, the sailor.

140
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,910
And at the other side is the 10 chip with the innkeeper.

141
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,329
I, all right, are we doing long 10 short two or short five?

142
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:03,160
I mean, I took 28 chips, 27 chips.

143
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,880
We gotta go 10.

144
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,000
It's the same guy.

145
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,599
You take a seat across from the innkeeper,

146
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:13,240
who you do not recognize from your travels through the city.

147
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,789
Okay, different person.

148
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,549
Let's make this quick, he says,

149
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,910
his nervous eyes giving the lie to his weary smile.

150
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,599
The innkeeper counts up five dice each and waves you to bed.

151
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,039
Here we go, swindle stones.

152
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:38,799
How about we lead at one, two ones.

153
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:47,190
Let's just fuck with them.

154
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,470
Three threes.

155
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,519
Three threes.

156
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:02,849
So I got one, four threes.

157
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:12,869
Call, oh, oh, did I get swindled?

158
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:13,509
What?

159
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:16,319
All right, I got swindled.

160
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,200
It's okay, it's all right.

161
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,319
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

162
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,279
All right, this guy's a good player.

163
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,000
This guy's a good player.

164
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,799
I got it, I got it.

165
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,789
Are you staying in Kare for long?

166
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,339
Two fours.

167
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,500
Shit, he started, okay, what about twos?

168
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
I have one two, he might have a two.

169
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,269
This is a bad start because I have one.

170
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:51,730
I'm going to say three threes.

171
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,529
Call it, that's fine.

172
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,609
There's no way you don't have one three out of you.

173
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:55,650
You got five there, right?

174
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,039
Holy shit, what?

175
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,390
There's nothing I could do there.

176
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:17,430
I'm actually in trouble now.

177
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:22,450
Two threes.

178
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,420
Say three threes and let me win this.

179
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,859
There we go, there we go.

180
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,740
All right, let's go for it.

181
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,019
There's no way, call that.

182
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,990
There it is.

183
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:40,599
We're coming back, we're coming back.

184
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,599
Oh, this is huge, this is a huge deal.

185
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,619
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

186
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,420
Oh, that you think they're.

187
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,259
Oh yeah, you're already saying there's one.

188
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:54,920
Why don't I just go this fucking four, right?

189
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,920
Do you think he'll call this?

190
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,089
If I say there are three or should I go there?

191
00:20:59,089 --> 00:21:00,130
Should I say there are four?

192
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,789
You think he probably has one, right?

193
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:10,720
He's going to call this and he's going to lose.

194
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,490
Call it, call it.

195
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:13,730
What?

196
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,509
No way.

197
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:30,740
So one, two, three, four, he must have at least two.

198
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:37,359
Shit, you have to call it.

199
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,400
I can't do it for you.

200
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,880
Call him on it, but he's probably going to have two.

201
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,559
Oh my God, I could have said six.

202
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:54,619
I should I was gonna say six. I could have done six. I was gonna do six. You saw me do it. Come on

203
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:08,500
There are two twos. Okay, call that shit. That means you have to have three. Fuck you. You don't have three

204
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:25,500
What the fuck this guy's getting insane hands. It's stupid. It's actually not fair. I have one of those two

205
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:41,059
Oh fuck off again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again

206
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:57,660
He got three insane hands in a row. I got so screwed. I really did. All right, let's start with one two two fours

207
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:15,799
Okay, let's do three fours. Call it four fours. Okay, five fours. Do you think he has two?

208
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:39,720
He's gonna call it and I'm gonna lose because that said we both have two then let's do it

209
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:55,359
Don't call it and actually might have got him. That means he has to have three. Let's call it. Just zap him

210
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,180
No, I can't just kill everybody. I have to be I have to win

211
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:08,599
Diplomatically, whatever this is. Listen, you couldn't let me win. Could you? Why we start at three?

212
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:15,940
Why are we starting at three? Oh, he started at two. What are you doing? Three ones?

213
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:39,240
He definitely has at least one one call it brief. Okay, so that means I have one don't call it shit

214
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:48,220
Okay, but does he have a do you have four fours? No, you don't. All right, we're getting that money back

215
00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:02,200
Okay, so we're gonna do open with what do I not have right? Okay, so let's do one

216
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:10,150
I'll start with one the two two

217
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:26,980
Two threes two fours, okay three ones. He's definitely has him on

218
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:38,109
I wonder what he has I'm gonna say four cuz he might he probably has two

219
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:49,240
Well, okay, that's that would be an insane hand if he had if he had three fours, which would be ridiculous

220
00:25:49,279 --> 00:26:02,109
And he does nope. Oh, thank God. Okay, I got it. So you've been to Vlada before no, you're a regular

221
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:11,289
I guess he only has two dice. So that's one three. Okay, so let's say

222
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:27,930
There are two threes which makes it physically impossible you have lost the game is over well one more round

223
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:36,779
But it's it's almost it's almost a 98% chance that he loses. Okay, so I got a one

224
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,220
one

225
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:47,390
one five two threes three threes

226
00:26:47,390 --> 00:27:00,490
I have one he probably had no I have two four. Yeah. Sorry buddy. That's not possible you lose

227
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:09,769
All right with a hearty laugh the innkeeper hands over ten chips you now have 24

228
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:25,529
All right, I'm back to where I was I have I'm back to my where I started with change table in the hall

229
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:49,990
More food and snacks the sailor buys a snack pick an opponent. I play the sailor. I'm gonna play the sailor

230
00:27:49,990 --> 00:28:03,099
This is for five. I think right. Oh, this is a this is a short game tips use hat puffs his pipe. Yoy

231
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,519
Ain't good

232
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:12,509
What you join the swarthy sailor at the table? He tipped his hat to you and puffs his pipe. You ain't good

233
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:28,049
He asks you merely nod and reply. Okay. What did he say? Let's start. Alright, so I got two

234
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:48,190
Two twos. Okay, really that means you might you must be well, let's say three then call it

235
00:28:48,329 --> 00:29:11,079
Okay, do we both have to that's the call. Yeah, you're full of shit. God damn it. We both had to that's unlucky

236
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:28,240
Yo, ain't lot the car. Oh suck. You're in like car. Oh suck. I don't know one three

237
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:45,539
I mean, this would be accurate. So let's see if he does three. Okay, there's no do you do you seriously have to again?

238
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:56,269
Bullshit. Yeah, okay back to even start with

239
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:13,000
One one three two threes. Okay, that's your full shit. You had to have had him both cuz I'm a liar

240
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:30,339
I'm a liar. What are you gonna go with one five two fives? Oh, sorry for that's impossible

241
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:32,339
I take your money

242
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:43,359
Continue you take his last die away winning the game with a frown the sailor hands over five chips

243
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,480
You now have 29 he gets up and swearing colorfully

244
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,140
He marched out of the hall to find something to drink now

245
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,259
Let's go play the old man

246
00:30:54,259 --> 00:31:06,069
Pious looking monk steps into the hall looks about and then sits down at the ten chip table a creature with only one eye gets

247
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,980
Sobbing and runs out of the hall. It seems it has lost the other eye in a bet

248
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Let's watch once again you spectate in the corner of the room

249
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,299
You notice a gnome who rushes in through a crack in the wall

250
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,880
Steals something from one player's pocket that is gone again

251
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,880
Nearby on the tables with a ten chip bet the innkeeper and the monk have just finished a game

252
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,450
The innkeeper shifts down to the five-stake table follow the gnome

253
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:48,039
Should we go after the gnome? I think we run after the gnome. Why not? What are these?

254
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:53,569
We don't know what he stole you dash after the gnome curious to see what he has stolen

255
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:59,099
The crack in the ball leads to a path that heads out through a wasted area of fallen down buildings

256
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:07,900
You lose sight of the gnome amongst the rubble what? Oh, I'm fucking dead

257
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:16,349
This is a narrow dirt track that dodges around piles of rubble on either side of the street

258
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,740
Looks as though a gigantic boulder has rolled down the path crushing everything in its wake

259
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,089
Even the pebbles underfoot have been ground to a fine dust. There's no sign of the gnome at all

260
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:36,519
A few blueberries grow by the side of the track look at the berry plant kneeling down by the plant

261
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,940
You look more closely at the blueberries. They seem perfectly ripe and glisten with juiciness

262
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:49,500
But you do not recognize them smell it you lean in close and take a deep breath from the plant

263
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,200
They smell sweet and rich and quite enticing pick a handful

264
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,460
You gather a handful of berries a few are squashed in your palm as you pick them coating your hand with a dark blue juice

265
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,579
Taste them you shove a handful of berries into your mouth

266
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,069
The taste is sweet almost sickly a moment later

267
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:14,150
That is exactly how you feel and you look down to see your hands are turning blue

268
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,019
Your breath is short in your lungs. You are suffocating from the inside out

269
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:34,170
Thinking quickly you stick your fingers down your throat causing yourself to be violently ill you make a terrible blue mess all over the ground

270
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,990
But at least you can breathe again you gather your strength then get back to your feet

271
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:47,799
You leave the deadly berries and move along. How do I I got a cat? How do I cash out?

272
00:33:47,900 --> 00:34:04,079
I have chips. Do I how many chips do I have? I don't have any money. I have 29 gambling chips

273
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:23,880
Maybe I could maybe I can cash them in go back and rewind. How many do I have left? 29

274
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:33,829
Cryptocurrencies the gnome berry wasn't worth it rewind. How many do I have to?

275
00:34:40,760 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't know. Okay, I'll rewind so it was not here. It was here not the track

276
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:13,659
It was right after this right here, right? All right, I'll use it

277
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:22,519
I'll use it cuz I have to catch I can't just drive 30 gold. All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna cash out

278
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:36,679
I've got 29 chips or should I just play against the old play the monk pick an opponent

279
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:42,829
The monk seems to be on a winning streak. All right, we're gonna play the monk

280
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:54,059
The monk hands you your dice and waves you to bid. Oh, it's a two game. That's it. Oh, oh

281
00:35:54,659 --> 00:36:03,099
I think we just start right off with two right cuz then he'll be like, oh shit

282
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,639
Do I just start right off with two ones?

283
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:18,840
I should just do one one if I do one one then he says two ones then he's gonna be like hey

284
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:36,869
I got a one or do one like one five or someone three. I'll do one one two

285
00:36:39,599 --> 00:37:01,159
Call that that means no wait. That's a lie. It wasn't a lie one one two ones. I got a one two, buddy

286
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:11,599
Oh, that's the game you lose

287
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:37,880
Furious you gift you remain at the table. No five. All right, this is dead. This was better

288
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:50,090
This is easier win. Look at this. I got three here. Let's just start with it. Let's start with like two

289
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:57,190
Something I don't have let's go fucking three three twos

290
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:11,409
You know what I mean? Three three twos four twos like you have three of them idiot

291
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:49,449
You have to have you have to have like there's no way right? There's no way that you have three again

292
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:55,590
No, there's no way. Yeah, that's not gonna say it. I get twice in a row get out of here

293
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:02,030
My ten gold maybe

294
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:14,989
All right, good start. Let's go with like one five one four

295
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:24,469
I always can't see that as five because of regular dice two fives. Okay, well three ones call it

296
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:27,230
There's no way what an idiot what a bad play that was. Okay, four ones

297
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:42,159
You might have five ones. You definitely have two ones. You would not have bet that if you didn't yeah

298
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:57,059
I've always wanted to come here. This is where the best players in Kari come to play. That's right

299
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:04,800
You're looking at one right now. Okay, I've got let's go with let's do something

300
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:23,559
Wacky here. Yeah, two ones two threes three threes call it call it four. Oh

301
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:40,019
Really? No, you don't. Mmm

302
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:50,909
two fours

303
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:59,320
Three four. All right, so you probably you have three fours. Wait, don't call that

304
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:15,239
You're gonna have two aren't you? Yes, I win. So what do you she got two to one dice left, right?

305
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:34,250
How many does she have left that two? Okay, so one two two twos three twos. It's got played actually a good

306
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:44,019
I almost got in trouble there. Uh, there is one

307
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,579
There with his one

308
00:41:46,619 --> 00:42:03,130
One one two ones done. All right, we're back to even with a frown the beggar girl hands over ten chips enough

309
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:15,230
Twenty nine. All right. All right, let's get out of here cash out

310
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,070
You had enough of your turn to cash your chips at the booth. Yeah cash out. I'm done

311
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:26,309
I made five dollars twenty nine gold pieces. I see you've come out a winner reply with a smile

312
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:35,780
You had one coin profit. No, I bought food in there. Okay, here we go

313
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:47,610
So plenty of ground to cover. All right, we're gonna go up or down. Well, by the way, this is up. This is oh so daisy

314
00:42:50,619 --> 00:43:07,079
Where am I? I didn't mean it up. Okay

315
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:20,730
Up or down down takes us through here. This this is down down here up heads through this square

316
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:24,360
We were here before we were here before

317
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,260
We were this is where we were and then we could have gone up through this square

318
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,260
But we were up here before although we might be able to go through a different alley here

319
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:47,429
Then we're gonna go up or down. That is what the pole is up or down. I'll give you a big view

320
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:52,380
this is what you can look forward to going this way or

321
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,329
potentially this way few places to go looks we can go like this or

322
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,300
like this or

323
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,400
This if I go follow that gnome again or this

324
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:11,619
But that's not part of your choice

325
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
It's close, but it's not too close. So

326
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:33,469
Okay

327
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:40,250
All right, that's pretty that's pretty much it 70% say go down. So we're gonna go down. Thank you for voting

328
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:47,900
Okay, you fall. Whoa, that's a lot you follow the road

329
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,219
Around the side of the gambling hall to a wide open space laid out for a market

330
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:59,659
There are several stalls all selling the same goods. They're traders arguing loudly over who has the cheapest or best quality

331
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,489
provisions weapons

332
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:06,329
useful gear magic items the well

333
00:45:06,929 --> 00:45:10,690
Okay. Well, I got I got money so we need to buy food. It's important

334
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:19,619
Browsing the stalls you find that food is reasonably expensive with the cheapest provisions being sold at three gold pieces each

335
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:31,070
One trader is also selling a wrap package of six meals for 15 gold. What's that come out to be? That's a great deal

336
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:42,590
That's a really good deal save like three gold, right?

337
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:52,000
But I don't but what if I run out of money don't buy food you turn the trader

338
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,119
Down the trader and move through the market. I think I can come back. Let me see what else is here

339
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:02,829
Let's browse the weapons take a turn about the armorer stalls

340
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:07,210
Mostly what is on sale is of poor quality or weaker than the blade you carry already

341
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:14,079
but two things catch your eye a hefty broadsword with a good solid grip and a bow with a quiver of

342
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,920
Silver tipped arrows a bow you lift the bow and test the string

343
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,820
It seems firm and responsive and although you have little use for ranged weapons

344
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:29,619
This one seems hardy enough the quiver is interesting it contains ten arrows

345
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:37,289
But each has a tip made not of steel but pure silver the armorer nods at you significantly as you discover this

346
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:41,510
Well, you know what?

347
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,519
No, the dead

348
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,539
Only silver can pierce the hearts of the dead and he adds in a whisper

349
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:55,280
six gold pieces I mean

350
00:46:56,849 --> 00:47:03,880
Silver arrows, I'm buying it. I'd like the bow you tell the armorer

351
00:47:04,179 --> 00:47:10,139
He makes a great fuss of packaging it up, but eventually hands over the bow in the quiver you pay him six gold pieces

352
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:16,159
Okay, what about the broadsword?

353
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,780
You look the broadsword and move your microphone up a little closer to your face

354
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,289
So you get that more podcast style storytelling voice perfectly balanced

355
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:30,650
Who's the sword maker not an antique either but made of brand new?

356
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:46,579
Eight gold pieces. Yeah, okay. I don't need it eight gold. No, thanks. That's too much

357
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:56,719
I'm moving on you found a clue. Oh cuz the silver shit do I lose my opportunity to buy food

358
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:03,019
It's okay. I've already eaten. All right

359
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:11,949
We're gonna browse magic items you scour the market for items that might be useful to you in magic

360
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:19,559
But find nothing except for one jeweler's stand which in amongst a lot of very expensive and overpriced jewelry is offering a sun jewel

361
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:23,639
For sale the exorbitant price of 15 gold. I already have a sun jewel

362
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:32,719
I already got it the trader's sun jewel is as beautiful as your own perhaps even slightly more polished

363
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,989
I don't need it now

364
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:49,489
Fuck off you point out the jewel a nice piece

365
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:56,289
But a fake in lower car a these cost ten I'll give you ten a nice piece

366
00:48:56,289 --> 00:49:06,260
But a fake wait cuz I have one that's a fake the jeweler laughs softly and pointedly removes the jewel from your hands

367
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,309
It most certainly is not fake

368
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:15,880
But if you cannot see that then I do not think you are the correct buyer for this exquisite piece

369
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:20,630
You take one last look at the Sun Jewel sigh and leave it walking back into the market

370
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:36,500
Mine is fake is mine the fake you browse around stall selling useful gear and items for travelers and crump across tooth ring

371
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,300
You know, they look useful

372
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,940
The first thing is a tinder box for lighting fires

373
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Though it will not work without tinder and the second is a bottle of snake bite antidote the tinder box costs two and the antidote

374
00:49:50,300 --> 00:50:02,369
Three I'll take them both you pay five gold pieces take both items you thank the trader and move off into the market

375
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:19,059
All right. I got a ton of stuff. You're definitely gonna get bitten by a snake at some point. Yeah, I got a snake antidote. Okay

376
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:26,789
So we can go down or it's giving us the opportunity to go up again

377
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:38,599
But you guys did not choose up you chose down so we're going to continue to go down that that is what that was decided

378
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,480
You guys did not say down then up you said down

379
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:50,780
By the well beyond the market is a street of tall iron fenced houses

380
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:57,639
You're entering a rich district built in relative safety close to the wall on the highest point of land in the city

381
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,619
Few creatures live here and it would seem that beggars are not tolerated

382
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:09,449
The streets are empty and for the first time clean you pass a well with a pulley attachment built above it

383
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:19,690
But no rope you flick a coin into the well and wait for several seconds before you hear the plop as it hits the water

384
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:29,780
The well is clearly very deep suddenly from below you hear a woman's voice singing throw down one more coin for me

385
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:48,139
Two wishes will I grant for thee throw a fucking fireball in the well? Oh, wait a minute. Okay read minds

386
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:58,059
God this dump dump

387
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:04,380
That would be insane. Imagine that like I'll throw another coin down for me. Hey, hey, you can take the whole crate

388
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,619
That's funny. All right, you can do that

389
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:14,769
Mud create quit when I'm gonna fill the well with quicksand and like drown the lady

390
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:23,820
protect from magic

391
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:28,260
Throw down another coin for me one more for a wish for thee

392
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:35,110
Yeah, back it up right here back. Yeah now pour the cement in there

393
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:38,329
mmm

394
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:48,559
That's fucked up. Um, I don't know what to do. These are all kind of funny. I mean sauce makes sense

395
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:58,300
Dodd is funny too. Let's do dud

396
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:06,949
Cast the spell creating a mountain of gold and treasure would you tip into the well piece by piece?

397
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:09,980
The voice inside begins to sing

398
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:17,530
Deliriously giddy with excitement at so much wealth after a few minutes of this a hatch opens in the side of the well house

399
00:53:17,849 --> 00:53:22,179
Which you had not noticed before a tiny gnome clamors out

400
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,889
he reaches down into the well unclips a rope from one side and attaches it to the pulley and then begins to haul up the

401
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:33,019
bucket, uh

402
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:40,389
What are you doing you demand but the gnome appears not to notice you it seems he is blind and maybe deaf as well

403
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:45,219
He continues to wind the pulley until the bucket reaches the surface of the well

404
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,550
All the water inside has drained away through holes in the base

405
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:54,849
There's a gold piece the gnome tips these out the gnome tips these out into a pouch

406
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:05,659
What's in the pouch though, right?

407
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:18,010
This is the same gnome that was stealing shit from the casino has to be it's gonna be probably ten twenty gold in there

408
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:29,260
Or do I wait and see what happens watch with a workman like air

409
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,260
The gnome lowers the bucket clips the rope away once more inside the well and strolls away up the road

410
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:41,110
The well begins to sing again now. I'm ready to work again one gold piece and I'm your friend

411
00:54:44,199 --> 00:55:08,590
Shit, I wanna rewind. Okay, ask him what he's doing

412
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:12,760
Okay, the gnome tips these out into a pouch

413
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,840
The gnome has a pouch of money grab the pouch

414
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,840
you reach down and snatch the pouch from the gnome who jumps almost out of his skin and then

415
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,840
Scarper's for cover in the well house once more in the pouch you find your gold piece

416
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:34,250
Along with a giant's tooth that someone must have thrown in by mistake. We've got two giant's teeth now. Yes

417
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:44,219
All right. That was worth a rewind. I have two now, right? Yep. Okay. Thank God. That was definitely worth a rewind

418
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,219
I'm out of rewinds by the way

419
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:57,900
Whatever you've reached a wide desolate area fenced off by an overgrown iron railing

420
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:02,510
Inside tall you trees reach up to twice the height of the city wall beyond

421
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:09,670
This is the necropolis the city of the dead for those who pass away and care with enough money to ensure their bodies are not

422
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:15,780
Simply tossed into the water the road to the north gate passes straight through and offers you no way around

423
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,829
The main path is wide enough for

424
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,349
processions and carts

425
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:29,230
But leading off it are several smaller paths that wind between the trees and headstones to all different suburbs of the graveyard

426
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:36,349
There are plenty of places for things to hide here enter the necropolis

427
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:47,590
After the hubbub of upper caray the necropolis has a silence which is almost deafening

428
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:51,800
Either side listing gravestones crawl with small creatures

429
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:58,119
No flowers grow here. It is like the bodies give off poison as they rot

430
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:06,530
Everything here is dead. And yet this place is neither empty nor still the graveyard

431
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:14,519
The wind whistles between the tall trees the Sun is setting behind the wall

432
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:21,210
Look around you step nervously off the path and walk between the nearest tomes

433
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,869
Some are ancient headstones

434
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,769
Ty

435
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:32,170
Tilted to crazy angles and some of them fallen face down as though the citizens of this graveyard have been drinking since they died

436
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,630
Others are fresh neatly carved and clean of all moss and weeds

437
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:46,079
They sparkle in the moonlight as though cleaned by maids and waiting for their occupants to arrive. Okay

438
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,679
explore the newer tombs explore the older tombs or

439
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,559
leave the graveyard

440
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,800
one

441
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,039
two three I

442
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:10,289
Will run a full one two three again one two three

443
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:22,139
One two three, what do you want to do? This is a one is newer tombs

444
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:26,880
Two is older tombs and three is to leave the graveyard

445
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:47,349
Hmm, where do they want to go? Seems to be pretty

446
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:59,150
Unanimous don't say that we're gonna be going to the older tombs. Thank you for voting explore the older tombs

447
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:06,159
You leave the path for the oldest area of the graveyard in the corner nearest to the city wall

448
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,960
Most of the stones here are now mere rubble a few statues lie facedown in the mud

449
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:19,559
A tree has split through a carved stone coffin search for grave goods

450
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,110
Find the oldest grave or search for grave goods

451
00:59:25,309 --> 00:59:26,659
All right

452
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:34,260
We're gonna find we look for grave goods you search between the ancient headstones for any offerings of grave goods left behind

453
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:43,039
These tombs are hundreds of years old. No one visits them anymore and offerings that were left have long since sunk into the clay

454
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,719
Find the oldest grave you soon find what looks to be the oldest tomb

455
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,639
It is a small mausoleum with a low roof supported by ornately carved pillars an inscription reads here lies

456
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,440
Lorag founder of Kare

457
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:15,079
Lorag the tome is a simple stone cabinet carved with the likeness of a man from centuries of rain and wind

458
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:21,989
You can make out nothing of it, but a long grizzled beard below the inscription is a longer tablet

459
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:24,289
But it is half weathered and covered in moss

460
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
open the tomb

461
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:40,869
Mini F, you know, I actually this weirdly enough. So I figured out what was going on

462
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:44,469
I didn't really figure it out. It's something to do with the game

463
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:52,099
Because have you noticed that when I streamed multiverses that not there was no problems at all

464
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:57,150
I actually did a test with the game open

465
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:05,880
I streamed this with just the game open and going it through OBS to the test servers and I dropped like

466
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:12,820
10,000 frames and I looked over at my like my internet and there was no drop frames through OBS. It was weird

467
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,980
So something about how this game is captured and I've I tried to make change a few settings

468
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:27,179
but yeah, I I was literally streaming this game to the test servers and dropped 10,000 frames and

469
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:30,090
The internet was up the whole time

470
01:01:30,409 --> 01:01:38,389
It was just up the entire time and it was like I was streaming the game to the server, right?

471
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:43,250
So I it was like you're dropping a ton of ton of frames 10,000 drop frames, but the twitch

472
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,869
Application I use is like no there's no drop frames. What are you talking about? So it's something to do with the game

473
01:01:48,869 --> 01:01:51,909
So I apologize for that or maybe it's a little bit of both

474
01:01:51,909 --> 01:02:00,780
I don't know but let's go we even need frames

475
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:07,829
Antivirus software hates this game for some reason. I don't think that's you

476
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,130
I don't think that should be the problem, but it's not a big deal

477
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,869
We you might see it happen once or twice a few times, but it's a text game. So we should be fine

478
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah, let's go. Okay, so I'm going to I'm gonna examine the man. I did put a frame limiter on this game

479
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,079
I put to make it so it doesn't have just like that like the 5,000 frames being rendered

480
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:40,750
So I put a hard frame limiter on the actual application itself, but it seems like doesn't really help that much

481
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:45,519
I don't know. Okay, you look closer at the car of man, but notice nothing more

482
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:49,119
It is just an engraving of an old man in a serene death pose

483
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,250
If this really is the grave of the founder of Carré

484
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:59,340
The chances are he did not die quite so peacefully the eyes of the carved statue appear to be watching you

485
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:06,119
You clear away the dirt from the carved inscription

486
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:14,050
But you still cannot make out the words only trace their outlines with your finger make a rubbing

487
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:19,849
For a rubbing of the inscription you would need some kind of charcoal to rub with and you have nothing to do that

488
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:27,440
We can't do it. All right, are we go are we opening this and getting like?

489
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,440
Possessed by the the demon that's in here, whatever

490
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:41,139
I mean we're going in right you look for a crack to lever open the lid of the tomb but find nothing

491
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:47,210
Presumably if there was anything here to steal it would have been long gone already you head away from the tomb fuck

492
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:51,019
We didn't have the right item for it. I couldn't do magic

493
01:03:51,659 --> 01:04:04,170
Shit. All right, whatever. I we're gonna go to the newer tombs. There are several tombs here

494
01:04:04,329 --> 01:04:10,880
There must have been a recent plague on the rich in the city. They're scattered around in roughly alphabetical groups

495
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:14,590
explore the tombs of

496
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,389
anagile to ferret

497
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:23,300
Explore tombs of Goyle to nephrit Oxl to Tamarin Oaks

498
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,400
Oaks or two years

499
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,750
Let's start down here. You browse around the tombs looking for a name you recognize

500
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,590
But none of them catch your eye something flitters past your face a bat

501
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,849
This is a bat who cares

502
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:56,840
Alright, how about but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, right?

503
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,150
Malus should we be looking for these names?

504
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,309
Corgo

505
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:12,820
Nick you're gonna be looking for these names. Let's do oxl to tamarin

506
01:05:13,059 --> 01:05:18,510
You look from one headstone to the other a few catch your eye, though. You cannot immediately say why ah

507
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:32,000
Shinvas mausoleum you approach Shinvas mausoleum carved above its door is here of rest Lord Shinva

508
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:39,380
If noble of Kari here we go

509
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:50,719
The door to Shinvas mausoleum seems to be unlocked and as a crack ajar as though

510
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:55,239
Someone regularly came and went just in front of it is a ring of little mushrooms

511
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,880
Growing up against the front step of the mausoleum

512
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:11,659
Hell somebody here

513
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:15,190
How safe passage

514
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:25,320
Protect from magic sense danger big

515
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,239
grow in size

516
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,030
You just walk around huge

517
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:45,139
Just do big

518
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:50,900
Big or sauce. What would be okay? Why would I want to be huge here? I'm gonna do sauce

519
01:06:51,780 --> 01:07:00,219
Cast the spell and your mind is filled with a clear sense of danger

520
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:03,460
Rising from the circle of mushrooms in front of you

521
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:08,960
Presumably they are poisonous, but you would surely not have been tempted to eat them anyway

522
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:18,840
So isn't the spell being overly cautious? I definitely would have eaten them. Look at the ring

523
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:21,159
You cross down and look at the mushrooms

524
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:27,880
They look highly poisonous not least because you cannot see a single insect crawling around or under any of them

525
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:36,940
Unusually the ring itself is also perfectly circular in shape in its center something silver glints a steak pushed into the soft soil

526
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:43,619
I take the steak you reach over to pull out the silver steak

527
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:58,260
But you cannot reach it without stepping inside the mushroom ring and your spell warned you against that but it's a shiny

528
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:12,769
Steak it's shiny metal do it. Anyway, I'm not taking it

529
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:19,399
It is too cold to stand still in the shadow of the wall. No jump over the ring

530
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:25,220
I'm so paranoid without this ring

531
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:33,409
I'm jumping over the ring you take a run-up and jump clear over the circle of mushrooms landing on the step of the mausoleum

532
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:42,819
I'm not walking through that nice magpie brain

533
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:52,729
Okay, shouldn't was tomb the air inside is freezing dust coats the floor urns line the walls

534
01:08:52,729 --> 01:09:00,640
But there is no coffin the floor space is empty except for in the far corner where a narrow stone staircase leads down into darkness

535
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:11,829
fog

536
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:15,479
summon darkness

537
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:18,079
Dopp open doors

538
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:23,260
sap cause depression

539
01:09:25,239 --> 01:09:47,960
Sun create light. Well, this is not dark. What else can I do all float in the air?

540
01:09:57,539 --> 01:09:59,819
Okay, well will I use the Sun jewel?

541
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,960
Does it consume it or do I get to keep it? I don't know

542
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,119
That's why I don't want to use it

543
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:19,550
You cast the spell in the Sun jewel in your pack begins to throw and ebb growing brighter and brighter until it fills the room

544
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:26,310
With a pale but brilliant light that reveals the mausoleum for what it is old stone and dust and nothing worse for that

545
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:40,420
Your spirits soar. Let's go make a move skulls peer at you from the walls turn and flee go downstairs

546
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:44,800
Unafraid of what you might find below you make your way towards the stairs

547
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,279
But you must have stepped on some kind of switch as behind you you hear a noise and you turn to see the door

548
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:59,710
It's swinging shut try to block it run for it

549
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:07,920
Fuck it. You stay back not wanting to be crushed by the heavy stone door

550
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:19,319
It seals with a bang in the dark the echo of the slamming door circles the room your light forms a pool around your feet

551
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:26,449
Wait, this door did that or this way what door did that?

552
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:40,539
I don't need the coat the ape feel the door or catches. It was the entrance door

553
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:51,260
Yeah, make a move. We're going down the stairs. Maybe there's a way out below you head for the stairs once more holding your light

554
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,529
Out in front of you. I'm not leaving

555
01:11:57,739 --> 01:12:02,710
Downwards you make your way cautiously down the ancient stairs into the dead earth

556
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:06,500
The walls are damp and there's a foul smell of decay

557
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:16,859
The only sound is a dripping coming from somewhere in the depths into the crypt you emerge into a large dark chamber

558
01:12:16,859 --> 01:12:21,750
Lit only by the light from your Sun jewel a coffin occupies the center of the room

559
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:39,810
Covered over by dust and spider webs. It's a wait and watch you hang back taking a few breaths to ensure the room is silent

560
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:45,310
That's when you hear the sound a moan and a rattle of chains coming from inside the coffin

561
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:47,369
The lid is moving back

562
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:52,289
Push it closed

563
01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:01,180
It's not like a boiling over a pot of like spaghetti. What do you mean? What do you mean put the lid on it?

564
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:11,420
What are you talking about? This is like a 5,000 year old demon person. I'm gonna stay back

565
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:19,180
You hang back watching and that's when you see the ghostly figure emerging from one of the owl cloves in the room

566
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,479
It is a death Wraith

567
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,800
wielding a cruel hooked dagger and

568
01:13:24,439 --> 01:13:25,760
sliding

569
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:31,039
Mercilessly towards you death Wraiths like all ghosts can only be harmed by weapons of silver

570
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:38,899
But it is quite capable of causing you harm. Thank God. I brought the fucking arrows attack

571
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:50,560
What can I do on hot fireball?

572
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:55,560
God

573
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,399
Illusion of worship. Oh, I couldn't pretend to be a god

574
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:02,180
yak fear

575
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:09,069
Hell should I read his mind? I wonder what it's gonna say

576
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:13,949
Kill kill kill kill. Like why would I do that?

577
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:24,329
in summon a replica creature

578
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,090
Kid create an illusion

579
01:14:32,439 --> 01:14:38,779
Wall invisible wall walk his shield

580
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:45,539
Just use the arrows

581
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:47,640
Hell does not cost stamina

582
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:59,750
You put on the skull cap and cast a spell reaching out to find the thoughts of the creature and perhaps learn something to your advantage

583
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:08,689
But you find nothing there is nothing and no one alive down here only specters shadows and death you hold on

584
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:25,869
Attack you stagger back to clear enough space to ready your weapon fire an arrow

585
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:35,140
Working quickly you unsling the bow from your back and notch an arrow the death Wraith grins with abhorrent glee

586
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:40,460
Until you let fly and the arrow strikes it in the arm it howls with pain

587
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:49,220
Shocked and angered at being hurt again. What follows is a terrible fight with every arrow you fire the death Wraith

588
01:15:49,539 --> 01:15:50,619
Stagger is back

589
01:15:50,619 --> 01:15:56,539
But as you reload the bow it creeps near again slashing at you with its knife as the quiver starts to run low

590
01:15:56,539 --> 01:16:04,250
You know each arrow counts and should and should even one miss then Shinva's tomb will become your own as you reach for your last

591
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:08,500
Arrow the death Wraith beams with glee it is weakened

592
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:16,020
But still not defeated fire the last arrow you fire the last arrow aiming directly for the death Wraith's heart

593
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:24,239
The boat flies true in the silver arrowhead buries itself deeply into the specters being it begins to flicker and fade and then with a last

594
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:30,579
Tortured gasp it slumps to the floor and threw it melting away into the cold stone

595
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:35,130
The crypt becomes peaceful as the battle ends

596
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:43,359
But then there is a creaking sound that makes you look back at the coffin it has opened and a figure is rising up

597
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:54,579
You watch as the figure takes shape a very old man and no monster

598
01:16:56,789 --> 01:17:05,390
Stranger I am in a great debt to you now at last I can die in peace

599
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:14,199
Tell me quickly before I am lost how may I repay you you stare in amazement

600
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:29,090
This must be the fifth noble Lord Shinva himself you step forward to greet the apparition

601
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:34,500
Oh, this is important. You are Lord Shinva. I have come to find out about the North Gate

602
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,300
I'm looking for the first noble. I required nothing of yours

603
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:47,220
I've come to find out about the North Gate you come looking in a strange place

604
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:54,979
Then the only gate down here leads to the underworld and I have been denied it for a very long time

605
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,880
Time

606
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,869
What do you know

607
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:09,380
Are you Lord shit fuck what a terrible thing would be nothing you are Lord Shinva

608
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:16,340
I'm looking for the first note. Wait, hold on. Don't move. Let me look at my notebook. He's just like

609
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,699
You he's just disintegrating and I'm like flipping through my notes. Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second. Um

610
01:18:23,859 --> 01:18:26,100
the first noble is

611
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:29,050
Sansa's and um

612
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,289

613
01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:35,619
What do you mean Lord shit fuck?

614
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:41,850
Okay, only Lord Sansa's knows the whole thing

01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:50,680
Yes, it's me Lord shit fuck

616
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,279
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm looking for the first noble of the city

617
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:04,470
I'm looking for the first noble of the city that I hope your mission is to kill him

618
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:12,300
The first noble will bring this city to wreck and ruin if that has not happened already while I have been down here

619
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:15,189
Tell me

620
01:19:15,189 --> 01:19:19,949
This car I still stand nah, dude

621
01:19:19,949 --> 01:19:36,659
It's fuck shit got fucked up like 20 years ago. Does it still stand? Should I say for now?

622
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:45,770
I feel like that's like hey, give me some info or should I be like, it's fucked up. It's over

623
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:52,850
I don't know what to say. Yeah, honey to pull

624
01:19:52,850 --> 01:20:00,300
I actually don't know which one of the what does what so one two or three one two or three one two three

625
01:20:00,699 --> 01:20:15,399
Cuz he's crumbling right now. I don't know give him peace

626
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:23,699
Yeah, what I have to say is no and it's all your fault he's like no

627
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:43,859
Okay, one two or three this would be quick that would be wicked fucked up

628
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:56,210
Yeah, it would be all this dude's just turn around just open the window behind him and look out and be like it's fine

629
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:05,949
How dare you? All right for now everyone's saying for now for now for now for all right. All right

630
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:13,460
All right, all right for now for now. He nods you shall see what follows perhaps

631
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:17,880
I will not I met a fortune teller once

632
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,000
a woman named

633
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,460
Cirici and she showed me how Sansa's would bring the city of fire and destruction

634
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:32,159
It was this knowledge that led to my fate of course such as the way of fortunes

635
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:38,670
Trickles of dust rained down from the roof of the crypt, but you are Lord Shinva

636
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:48,840
I am oh, I was once the fifth noble of the city. Would you believe?

637
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:56,369
And you who are you? I'm a stranger

638
01:21:56,369 --> 01:22:06,760
I'm from Anna land Shinra raises a dusty eyebrow. I know what interest does Anna land have in the ways of Kari

639
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:12,260
Hmm. I traveled to the backlands

640
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:20,289
I see so you need to pass through the North Gate and for that you must know the spell

641
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:28,850
Perhaps you know it already. No. No, I do you know it. I tell me it. Do you know what it is?

642
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:35,380
No, I don't know it. What should I say? Do you know it? Do you know it?

643
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:44,079
I know one line one lock made of golems hide

644
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:58,739
I wish you luck finding the others but tell me what lies in the backlands that Anna land could want I explore for myself

645
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:07,659
Mampang and the crown of Kings. I mean this guy's about to disappear. Thanks for the line. I got what I wanted

646
01:23:07,659 --> 01:23:16,890
I'm here for the crown of Kings a crown. What of the crown? It has been stolen. Oh

647
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,319
Then today is a good day to die

648
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:31,039
Crown of Kings is an ancient object you understand from a time when the world was young and great forces

649
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,300
Stuck the land force is too great

650
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:42,279
But such as we are today powers that could shape beings and minds with the slightest whim and mold the land and see to their will

651
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:51,899
Do you understand what the crown does it provides influence? It allows control. It is nothing just a symbol

652
01:23:55,289 --> 01:24:01,020
It provides I think it provides influence provides control dead guy voice

653
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:20,930
Influencer crown it provides influence. It provides influence much more than that

654
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:28,100
Only once was I in the power of the crown as it passed from lend the land to Bryce

655
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:34,079
I was an envoy at the court when it arrived and as the power to turn your will to

656
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:38,369
Another's without you knowing what is happening. You see the power of that

657
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:45,020
No one under the influence of the crown can ever revolt as they do not understand that they are in servitude

658
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:56,779
What can you tell me of the backlands very little? Oh, but I remember one told to me in my crib

659
01:24:56,939 --> 01:25:05,989
Will you hear it? Yes, please tell me for sleeping of the sleepless ram seek out the one they call the sham

660
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:10,300
Shinva shakes his ancient head

661
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:16,810
I could not tell you what the sleepless ram is perhaps device and not mere nonsense

662
01:25:16,949 --> 01:25:25,340
Your light flickers for a moment ready to plunge you into darkness. Farewell old man. Farewell stranger

663
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:32,010
May your life and fate be better than mine the spell lines you have found are listed in the key section of your inventory

664
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:35,489
Finally with a withered finger

665
01:25:35,489 --> 01:25:42,659
He directs your attention to a gnarled rope that hangs down in one corner of the room that controls the trap on the door

666
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:57,260
And he's gone

667
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:08,560
RIP shit fuck that's just bugleberry

668
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:18,819
No, it's they're different you slash the rope with your sword a heavy counterweight falls and shatters to the floor

669
01:26:18,899 --> 01:26:25,060
Lord Shinva nods wait. He's not he's still here. Well, she even nods and drifts towards his coffin

670
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:29,439
I give the last of my life to you

671
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:38,510
You feel a cold strength flood your veins and turn quickly and make your way upstairs

672
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:48,130
Nice the door at the far end of the mausoleum is open step outside

673
01:26:48,350 --> 01:27:07,460
You return through the open door to the path still shivering from your meeting with a ghost. So hold on. Okay, where's my?

674
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:24,899
Victorious noble Northgate spell. Do I have this like the spell anywhere? It was just the clues the keys

675
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:34,470
Okay, that's Shinva's line one lock made of golems hide. I have a bunch of other clues too. I need three more

676
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:38,000
We have enough. We have a lot of clues for the other ones. I think

677
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,149
You avoid the ring of mushrooms as you leave

678
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:46,670
Outside night is falling and things are stirring between the moaning trees

679
01:27:46,869 --> 01:27:55,350
You would do well not to linger here so scurries across your foot and is gone. All right, we're up this way

680
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:09,539
Leaving the graveyard you return to the path gratefully and make your way to the far side of the graveyard

681
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,420
Beside the gate is a disused well

682
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:18,529
Perhaps once used to draw water to wash the bodies before in turn mint look down

683
01:28:18,729 --> 01:28:21,729
You lean over the side of the well house to peer down

684
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:25,890
It's pitch black of course and seems to go down forever and for a moment

685
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:31,369
It looks as though there is something in the shaft but a moment later it is gone a trick of the moonlight

686
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:40,859
Perhaps pull the bucket up you turn the winch on the side of the well drawing up the bucket from beneath

687
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,060
It comes to the top filled with clear water

688
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:46,560
Is this as fresh as the water from the other fountain you tried?

689
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:55,140
Frank you scoop a handful of water and taste it despite your surroundings. It is fresh and quite clear

690
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:04,340
You like a 20 health throw a coin in you toss a gold piece in it falls for a long while and then you hear a

691
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:13,470
Distant tiny splash the rear gate of the graveyard hangs from its hinges, but not from age

692
01:29:13,829 --> 01:29:15,829
It seems it has been taken apart

693
01:29:15,949 --> 01:29:27,640
Maybe widened even to let something through beyond as a deep forest when's green screen movie night part two Saturday

694
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:43,399
Saturday this weekend. We're gonna do it again this Saturday. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep green screen part two

695
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:49,920
All right, let's keep moving. It'd be another

696
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:51,800
one to

697
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:59,909
130 150 videos you walk for half an hour through thick trees along a narrowing track

698
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:07,180
Until you reach a fork in the road to the left the track gets narrower still to the right a massive shadow looms

699
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:12,020
so large it seems as though a colossus has seated itself on the wall and thought a

700
01:30:12,859 --> 01:30:20,680
Chill wind blows through you as though ghosts walked back and forth this way the shadowy

701
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,100
Thing to the right has a jagged silhouette

702
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:30,130
It's a ziggurat with perhaps a hundred steps leading to its apex the trees whisper and move

703
01:30:30,449 --> 01:30:35,449
Looking left you see distant flicker torchlight through the trees the north gate

704
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:41,329
Perhaps night is drawing in you should get moving things whisper between the tweeze

705
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:53,750
The ziggurat or the road to the gate one or two

706
01:30:54,229 --> 01:30:57,779
Let's get a pole going for one or two one

707
01:30:58,539 --> 01:30:59,619
two

708
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:28,489
One leads up to the gate two goes into the ziggurat one two two for the tiger mount

709
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:38,180
I don't know that's a reference to is that a wild reference all right. We're going to

710
01:31:38,739 --> 01:31:42,060
Thanks for voting the ziggurat

711
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:52,529
you stand at the base of a towering ziggurat built from carved stone blocks each the size of a hay bale the temple rises higher than the

712
01:31:52,529 --> 01:31:59,060
City wall and position to catch the first star of evening at its uppermost point a moment

713
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:05,880
Which is just passed for an opening you tilt your head back looking for an opening and finally make one out a

714
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,800
Small black dot about a third of the way up

715
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:16,039
But even that is quite some climb for the less devoted worshippers a small gargoyle by the steps has an open mouth

716
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:33,279
Ready to accept offerings climb up a look at the gargoyle the gargoyle is carved in the shape of a small but spiky dog

717
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:40,310
With long claws sharp horns and a pointy beard its mouth is wide open and its tongue

718
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:44,789
Lawls out with a coin-shaped slot at the back of its throat

719
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:58,569
You need to take attack the tail

720
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:07,079
Okay, so drop in a gold piece you slide a gold piece in the gargoyle's mouth for a moment

721
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:13,539
Nothing happens then it appears to swallow and next it opens its stone eyelids to reveal two crisp and beautiful eyes

722
01:33:13,939 --> 01:33:16,729
Look into the eyes

723
01:33:16,729 --> 01:33:21,050
Looking into the gargoyle's eyes fills you with a sense of calm and peace

724
01:33:21,409 --> 01:33:28,329
The eyes closed after a moment, but the sense of well-being remains, or did you just imagine that the gargoyle moved?

725
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:43,609
Oh, what should I do climb make a move make a move you have a healthy fear of Kari's weirder gods

726
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:46,810
You return to the fork. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what I wanted

727
01:33:47,010 --> 01:33:57,750
That is not what I wanted. Let's do everything the same way did it

728
01:33:58,149 --> 01:34:09,420
Okay, climb up you begin the climb hauling yourself up the first step either this ziggurat was built for giants or

729
01:34:09,899 --> 01:34:16,319
Ascending as an act of devotion the next few steps are equally exhausting you have to throw your pack up first and follow

730
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:22,449
I think I remember doing this last time

731
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:29,829
Zen hover. Yeah, I think I remember doing this

732
01:34:31,619 --> 01:34:41,539
Sun create light. Yeah, we can do big and just yeah, we can do big. Oh

733
01:34:44,329 --> 01:34:46,329
Sauce is good is there too. What else?

734
01:34:47,569 --> 01:34:50,449
How is interesting safe passage?

735
01:34:50,850 --> 01:35:05,550
Float in the air is a good one. Are they both one? Yeah, I remember doing big before

736
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:17,850
Let's do it. You cast a spell swelling to three times your size. You are now able to run up the stairs

737
01:35:18,529 --> 01:35:20,489
But the scale quickly changes

738
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:26,329
It seems the builders of the pyramid created an optical illusion and the later steps are not as high as the lower ones

739
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:29,890
The change is so gradual that you hardly notice as the spell fades

740
01:35:30,090 --> 01:35:37,060
You reach a halfway point almost as high as the city wall beyond and pause to rest halfway up

741
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,489
You're halfway up

742
01:35:40,489 --> 01:35:48,840
breezies of gargoyles and polished metals ring the temple on this level view you pause to take the in the view

743
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,569
from this side of the ziggurat you can see nothing but the top of the wall and

744
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:59,760
Beyond the gleaming darkness of the marshes of the backlands walk around to the north walk around to the north

745
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:06,770
You move around to the north face. You can see the path ahead running straight between wild and overgrown trees

746
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:12,069
It seems very few people come this way anymore. The north gate itself is now visible

747
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:18,479
However, and appears deserted then you notice a point of light torches been lit between the trees

748
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:26,909
Watch the torches you watch as the torches move through the trees towards the path. They're making slow progress

749
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:32,109
But they are moving towards the graveyard and presumably from there on into town

750
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:45,500
The wind claws at you trying to pull you to earth. I haven't eaten. I only have one revision

751
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:50,649
I'll eat it at least away from the rats and night foxes that live on the ground

752
01:36:50,649 --> 01:36:54,210
You're free to eat you take out the last of your cheese and I still have cheese

753
01:36:54,569 --> 01:37:06,670
You still I still have cheese from like three months ago. However long it's been. Okay

754
01:37:06,989 --> 01:37:13,390
Let's go higher you continue the weary climb to the first level of the ziggurat by the opening

755
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:22,140
You climb for another 20 minutes up the steep stone steps until you are gasping and panting for breath once more

756
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:26,520
But finally you reach the dark opening that you saw from the base of the temple

757
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:31,100
The steps themselves continue up a little further still to the very peak of the temple

758
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:36,529
The opening is guarded by rock sculpted images of unimaginable creatures

759
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:41,609
Beyond you see a long dark hallway with something large and gleaming at the far end

760
01:37:42,010 --> 01:37:47,050
Treasure I mean

761
01:37:53,909 --> 01:38:07,159
You step into the temple the hollow space

762
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:14,239
Amplifies your footsteps and they echo eerily for several moments on the floor in

763
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:17,760
Guilt inlay is written the name of the god who inhabits this space

764
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:28,899
It seems that the ziggurat is of corga the gracious don't wait. I have something on corga

765
01:38:29,399 --> 01:38:39,579
Corgas three eyes the ritual of corga involves his three eyes the left eye right eye and the third eye in his forehead

766
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:48,220
That it I think I remember this

767
01:38:48,760 --> 01:39:00,260
Yeah, I remember this I forget I forget everything. Okay, let's wait

768
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:03,640
You wait for a few heartbeats to see if you have disturbed anything

769
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:08,729
Nothing happens and you catch the tail of a gigantic snake

770
01:39:09,289 --> 01:39:15,920
Slithering across the floor and disappearing into a crack in one wall for the markings along its back. It's highly poisonous

771
01:39:16,439 --> 01:39:25,779
Drink my snake antidote. I didn't get bit yet. Why would I drink the antidote? I didn't get bit drink the antidote

772
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,779
Why would I drink it now? I haven't gotten bit yet

773
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:45,590
Free antidote. Let's go. Oh shit. You went to the temple, but the snake still manages to catch you by surprise

774
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,159
Launching itself from a crack in the ceiling behind you

775
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:57,920
All right, we're going like eight. Oh

776
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,079
Come on

777
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:07,100
Temple snake snaps and hisses in the air between you you swing out

778
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:12,140
Wildly hoping to chop it in two as it slivers away and do around a pillar out of reach

779
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:23,010
It lifts up bearing its mighty fangs dripping with poison. Oh fuck you you drop into a crouch the temple snake strikes

780
01:40:23,010 --> 01:40:29,970
You desperately defend yourself against its poison soaked fangs. You fall badly as you stagger back. It hisses from the darkness

781
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:35,569
All right, so they just went full blast. We're gonna go like two like two point. Yeah

782
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:37,340
Good

783
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:46,020
Now we go full blast. It spits in the gloom. Is it can I get it and get it?

784
01:40:46,699 --> 01:40:48,340
Yep, dead

785
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:56,260
Temple snake is retreating but you give chase you cleave the air with your sword with a weird scream that echoes around the cold stone

786
01:40:56,420 --> 01:40:59,699
The snake dies its head crashing to the floor

787
01:40:59,739 --> 01:41:05,989
You wipe your sword clean and wait for the violent echoes of the fight to fade away

788
01:41:06,189 --> 01:41:10,170
Then you go further in the side of the shrine takes your breath away

789
01:41:10,449 --> 01:41:19,260
The walls are decorated with brightly colored murals depicting scenes from the religious mythology of Kare fine ornaments and precious metals

790
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:26,609
Are set into owl cloves around the pews and rich woven tapestries cover every surface a cunning trick of architecture

791
01:41:27,029 --> 01:41:29,029
catches the wind past the doorway and

792
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:35,399
Creates a constant ethereal humming as though a crowd of monks sat in permanent meditation inside

793
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:53,180
Leave further in at the far end of the hallway for large stone gargoyles of winged demons watch over the shrine

794
01:41:53,420 --> 01:41:55,420
from mounts high up in the eaves

795
01:41:55,899 --> 01:41:59,220
Guarding the altar on which a gigantic idol squats

796
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:06,140
Corga himself. It is a life-size version of the model of Corga you saw in the abandoned house yesterday

797
01:42:16,739 --> 01:42:26,340
Steal something approach the altar. I'm not gonna steal anything. This is the dumb thing to do

798
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:29,239
This is how you get the wrath of the gods

799
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:39,739
I'm approaching the altar you walk up towards the altar across a richly patterned carpet something about it gives you pause

800
01:42:39,739 --> 01:42:43,319
Its surface is decorated with wide symbols that seem to deliberate

801
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:51,819
Too deliberate to be accidental walk across avoid the star shapes avoid the circles avoid the spirals cast a spell

802
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:07,770
Can't we know

803
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,260
Zen is float

804
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:14,279
How would be good right what but that's too literal isn't it?

805
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:22,180
Wouldn't it just say turn around and leave yeah, it's gonna say turn around and walk out the door remember

806
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:26,779
How is completely literal it's just how to find a safe passage is out

807
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,180
It's not gonna be like oh the carpet do this that no it's gonna go leave turn around

808
01:43:37,239 --> 01:43:38,680
mmm, I

809
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:43,020
Could float I'm just gonna float over it

810
01:43:43,539 --> 01:43:50,829
Cast the spell reducing your weight to that of a feather you should now be safe from any pressure traps and just go across

811
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:56,210
Relying on your spell to keep you safe you step forward across the carpet towards the idol

812
01:43:56,210 --> 01:44:00,350
But it seems whatever trap is here does not require much weight to be triggered

813
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:08,279
Something happens although you cannot be sure what one moment you're in the temple of corga and the next you are falling what

814
01:44:08,699 --> 01:44:12,300
What are you talking about?

815
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:20,500
You're floating slowly down through the air turning and over you're in pitch blackness. You cannot see a thing no

816
01:44:20,779 --> 01:44:27,979
I'm in the sewer again. No no no no no no no no no I can't rewind let me rewind

817
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:37,270
Can I let me rewind please I don't have any more rewinds left, but can I just go back?

818
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:50,619
I want to do that I used them all can I go I want to go do that can I go do it you made your choice up

819
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:59,989
Okay, all right run a poll can we get can we get a chat's choice rewind it has to get at least if it has

820
01:44:59,989 --> 01:45:14,399
To get at least 50% to be yes has to be at least 50%

821
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:27,449
That's so easy to get to all right. I'll make it harder at least 70% save scum

822
01:45:27,449 --> 01:45:32,039
I know, but I want to I want to go do that. Okay. I just got like thrown across the whole game

823
01:45:32,039 --> 01:45:44,970
I just went into the air and floated and the God was just like no dude. That's not happening all right

824
01:45:45,029 --> 01:45:56,270
That's at 76% just walk back there, bro. That's so far away sure

825
01:45:56,789 --> 01:46:05,899
Can I can I actually get back up there? I don't think I can I don't I actually don't think I can get back up there

826
01:46:05,899 --> 01:46:19,939
And I think it's gonna be great out. I can just keep going

827
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:24,520
Yeah, do can I actually get back up there when I get out?

828
01:46:24,920 --> 01:47:01,989
Okay, okay, you cast the spell and a clear calm voice enters your mind and informs you

829
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:08,760
There is indeed a trap in the rug in front of you before it can tell you where a second presence enters your mind

830
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:14,579
Booming it declares make your choice worshiper

831
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:24,930
Corga himself perhaps avoid the stars the circles of the spirals

832
01:47:34,609 --> 01:47:39,720
The circles avoid the circles all right

833
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:46,590
I'm gonna go avoid the circles you walk up to the altar stepping carefully around the circle in the carpet and re yeah

834
01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:57,039
All right. Yes, we made it you stand before the idol a fat statue set with gems and curious pock marked features

835
01:47:57,220 --> 01:48:08,029
Above his head is a plaque that bears an inscription read it

836
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:14,729
Reads on corgas face you kiss across and finish with the lips

837
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:19,609
For answers to your questions you must err not else he spits

838
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:26,109
You step nervously up the steps until you are below the great statue you consider the idol

839
01:48:26,109 --> 01:48:29,260
It is the same as the statuette in the abandoned house

840
01:48:29,699 --> 01:48:36,319
Except that had blue dots painted on its two eyes its third eye in the forehead and on its lips

841
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:48,659
Okay on corgas face you kiss across and finish with the lips for answers to your questions

842
01:48:48,659 --> 01:48:58,699
You must err not else he spits okay, so don't ask a question because he's gonna literally spit in your face

843
01:48:58,779 --> 01:49:04,649
So we need to on corgas face you kiss across

844
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:17,189
Finish so you do the you kiss the lips last you stand on tiptoes and lean in preparing to kiss the statue

845
01:49:17,189 --> 01:49:21,989
But where does the humming in the temple seem to be getting louder I can pray to the ape

846
01:49:26,109 --> 01:49:32,699
Imagine going into another God's temple and putting your hands together and praying to your God and my God is an ape

847
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:35,210
This is like an all-powerful

848
01:49:35,210 --> 01:49:41,689
Like super demon God I have this I have like a monkey. That's just to hang it out looking over a cloud

849
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:51,100
But what is the ape gonna do here? That's blasphemous should I pray to the ape?

850
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,619
I'm gonna do it for fun

851
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:59,079
You try a prayer to the ape for guidance, but it seems in the temple of another God the ape cannot hear you

852
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:01,840
You're on you're on oh

853
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:09,149
Okay, all right

854
01:50:09,149 --> 01:50:14,529
It was it was a cross right and then lips last

855
01:50:14,909 --> 01:50:22,640
Ritual of corga involves his three eyes left eye right eye in the third eye in the forehead

856
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:38,779
So what we go left right forehead left right forehead left right forehead lips or left forehead, right?

857
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:44,760
Let's go for it left eye. It's the left eye first

858
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:54,399
You place a kiss on the idols left eye you hear something flittering in the upper levels of the temple kiss the idols right eye

859
01:50:54,840 --> 01:51:05,039
Next you kiss the right eye kiss the idols forehead. It's the idols lips

860
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:14,380
Finally you lean low and kiss the idols lips as you straighten once more you see the idols eyes flick open a soft voice

861
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:18,949
issues from its mouth

862
01:51:18,949 --> 01:51:26,720
Stranger you are not of my faith and yet you have completed my ritual. How can that be?

863
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:45,729
I merely read your instructions. I'm lucky. I've merely read your instructions the gods laughs softly

864
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:51,100
Graciously very well. I see you are modest if impolite

865
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:53,760
My reward is to answer one question

866
01:51:54,159 --> 01:52:03,109
But I am the god of grace and I require my followers to show grace and you have not I can see all

867
01:52:03,829 --> 01:52:10,359
Remember, I am a god and I see that you have committed murder a red-eye guard

868
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:15,670
So I deny you my aid as you denied others their lives

869
01:52:15,989 --> 01:52:23,520
His voice rises from a gentle whisper to a rolling thunder that echoes around the walls now leave

870
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:27,319
Or I will repay you in kind

871
01:52:37,989 --> 01:52:47,510
What get the ape down here? Oh, yeah. Oh fuck you. I got the ape. What are you gonna say that?

872
01:52:52,529 --> 01:53:05,260
Yeah, fuck you Corga argue you deny me my right you declare I

873
01:53:09,010 --> 01:53:11,010
deny you

874
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:14,500
Everything

875
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:29,649
And then the idol moves standing gracefully onto its two bow legs and leans forward tag the monkey in do I run no

876
01:53:29,649 --> 01:53:34,819
Let's fight this motherfucker. I look I've got beeswax. I have a helmet

877
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:41,590
Drive run what you can't kill somebody if you kill people you can't do this

878
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:49,750
I don't remember this breeze before you can react the statue of Corga plants a mechanical kiss on your forehead

879
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:56,840
You hear the click, but you do not feel the sting of the poison dart as it enters your skin and burrows into your brain

880
01:53:57,319 --> 01:54:07,279
Okay, whatever

881
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:18,409
So I just have to leave I can't what am I supposed to do?

882
01:54:18,409 --> 01:54:23,069
I have to leave I literally might as well just rewind back to when I was in the sewer

883
01:54:23,069 --> 01:54:55,430
I should have stayed in the sewer then is there anything else I can do here. Okay, I am I've read

884
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,250
I've read your instructions. Oh, you killed people. Oh, I

885
01:55:00,529 --> 01:55:03,149
I'm gonna repay you in kind fine. Fuck off leave

886
01:55:03,149 --> 01:55:06,930
You don't need a second warning you turn and hurry out of the temple for the god can get revenge

887
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:22,270
What a fucking crock of shit you're back by the opening in the temple what I killed a person

888
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:25,229
So I'm not allowed to have a god

889
01:55:25,829 --> 01:55:31,430
Help me go back up. Oh

890
01:55:32,149 --> 01:55:40,329
Wait, yeah, I can go to the top right right right. Let's go up top

891
01:55:40,369 --> 01:55:48,479
All right climb for the top you turn back to the steps and climb higher

892
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:54,279
All the way to the top of the ziggurat night has fallen star spread across the sky in a peaceful repose

893
01:55:54,779 --> 01:55:56,779
That bellies their true nature

894
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:02,170
Warring spirits tussling for control of the world below. Look at the stars

895
01:56:02,729 --> 01:56:07,090
With your head tilted back. You can see more stars than you ever have seen in this city

896
01:56:07,649 --> 01:56:15,250
Perhaps you are above the level of the lights and the smog and the dust or perhaps more stars choose to cluster here

897
01:56:15,489 --> 01:56:17,729
around this sacred site if

898
01:56:17,729 --> 01:56:24,010
You were a true mage and not a mere sorcerer who knows what spells one could weave at a spot like this

899
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:42,180
You lean back and look up trying to recognize the stars from your studies puke

900
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:53,159
Tar have I learned anything

901
01:56:53,720 --> 01:56:55,720
Have I do I any info?

902
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:19,859
Did I get any info? I might have I don't know zip are

903
01:57:20,739 --> 01:57:23,930
res

904
01:57:23,930 --> 01:57:37,260
Zed I would have had to have known it the page at the beginning had CA

905
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:46,710
That's right that the lady took it didn't she is there a CA here?

906
01:57:47,029 --> 01:58:02,529
Let's try there's no see

907
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:14,500
Pu per I know that there's a few combinations you can actually do here and I am not I don't

908
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:19,329
Her is good. There's I know there's at least three or four you can get from this

909
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:23,039
Should I do per puke? Should I try per?

910
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:25,680
What does purr do?

911
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:37,420
Her all right. I'm gonna try it fashion stars into alignment and an enchantment is created

912
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:42,439
For a moment nothing seems to happen and then a screeching noise reaches you

913
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,359
From the distance and across the city. It is the sound of a thousand mewling stray cats

914
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:56,449
It lasts a few minutes and then fades away you found one of the secret spells of the temple of corga

915
01:58:57,090 --> 01:59:00,699
What I can summon a thousand cats

916
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:08,710
You look out across the city in the far distance you see torches in the woods towards the north gate

917
01:59:09,329 --> 01:59:15,210
Looking back you see the lights of caray coming on and the shouts of revelers drunks and nighttime thieves

918
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:23,869
The view is quite run. It's wonderful, but your journey beckons you start the long climb back down the ziggurat once more

919
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:37,699
Hmm, let's go the climb back down is going easier halfway down you pause to rest

920
01:59:38,140 --> 01:59:44,689
You look out to the north the thick trees are still lit by torchlight and you hear the distant bang of wolves

921
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:53,720
Half an hour passes nothing changes except the sky grows colder and the wind picks up cutting through your cloak wait

922
01:59:54,159 --> 02:00:01,409
You settle down to wait on one of the stone steps watching as the line of torches fans out through the trees and

923
02:00:01,869 --> 02:00:05,289
Marches slowly forward as some disappear new ones are lit

924
02:00:05,489 --> 02:00:12,369
But eventually after the Sun is finally gone and the stars come up above you the trees around the north gate are inky blank

925
02:00:12,369 --> 02:00:15,989
And there is no light except for a single flame on the gate itself

926
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:26,970
The way through the forest should now be clear. Oh, that was this that was going this way. Okay, so now that I was looking at this

927
02:00:27,489 --> 02:00:40,090
There's a bunch of torches, right? Okay. Okay, work the mud under for to stamp with footprints and in between them the Prince of

928
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:41,329
many paws

929
02:00:41,329 --> 02:00:54,000
The road to the gate you walk between clawing trees and thick bushes

930
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:56,079
The north gate is finally in sight

931
02:00:56,199 --> 02:00:59,760
You can see it's imposing or nately carved wooden doors

932
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:06,460
Over the top of the guard huts and low buildings that lie at the end of the road you pause to watch the guard huts

933
02:01:06,579 --> 02:01:13,739
They seem quite still one has a hole in its roof weed grows through the chimney of another are they abandoned?

934
02:01:13,779 --> 02:01:16,210
But before here in there is a long road

935
02:01:16,649 --> 02:01:23,989
Lined by thick and gloomy trees a patch of wild forest like you haven't seen since the hills go cautiously

936
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:29,939
You make your way slowly forward trying to ensure your feet do not crunch too loudly on the gravel

937
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:41,750
Something is keeping pace with you just behind the tree line stalking you stop and look you stop and turn to look into the trees

938
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:43,670
There's the faintest flicker of a gleam

939
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:50,229
And that's all the warning you get a wild bristlebeast leaps up from the trees and knocks you down you scramble for the sword

940
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:55,600
Set right here. Nice

941
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:58,119
start

942
02:01:58,119 --> 02:01:59,600
Do it again

943
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:03,640
Got it again clean

944
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:05,800
We're gonna go again

945
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,260
2.1. Oops. Oops rewind rewind

946
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:14,310
I think I have enough

947
02:02:14,310 --> 02:02:19,829
Okay, that's fine. I have to defend now

948
02:02:20,449 --> 02:02:28,920
Drops its jaw. All right, it's coming in. Oh fuck off. It's coming in now. I have to defend again

949
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:38,850
That's fine. Now I go full blast the bristlebeast hunkers down

950
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:46,050
Got it leveling your blade you strike backed up against a tree

951
02:02:46,050 --> 02:02:49,989
You can barely swing your sword, but you muster all of your strength with a final swing

952
02:02:49,989 --> 02:02:56,149
You bury your blade deep into the bristle beast it twists on the metal then curls up like an overheated beetle and dies

953
02:02:56,369 --> 02:03:06,489
The night air falls silent once more you continue on quickly through the trees. You're at the north gate

954
02:03:07,109 --> 02:03:15,710
You've reached the north gate the ground before it is wide and clear and lit by blazing torches set into brackets

955
02:03:15,909 --> 02:03:20,659
Either side of the enormous sealed doors should there be archers hiding in the shadows

956
02:03:20,779 --> 02:03:26,550
They would have a clear sight of you off to one side as a well, but there's no other cover

957
02:03:26,590 --> 02:03:40,020
You don't know all the spell lines, of course, but perhaps the gate will open to adopt spell after all don't have all the spell line

958
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:48,010
I will tell you guys

959
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:52,380
I know what happens when you get to the door and

960
02:03:53,529 --> 02:03:58,409
It is not up. It does not work. I have one spell line

961
02:04:00,949 --> 02:04:09,729
It'll work clueless. It'll work huff blow it down

962
02:04:12,699 --> 02:04:14,689
This how

963
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:25,760
No, no, I okay. I think I'm trying to remember how this plays out

964
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:29,630
I know how it plays out, but I don't know how you get there

965
02:04:30,979 --> 02:04:39,600
I'm gonna wait or I'm gonna stride right over to it. Can I do per?

966
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:48,979
No, but yeah, I can't do per I'm gonna just I'm gonna walk over to it

967
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:54,680
Throwing caution to the wind you step out of the shadows and approach the gate time to see if you have learned enough of

968
02:04:54,680 --> 02:05:06,149
Your travels to go through the city and unlock the gate you reach the other side of the clearing unscathed and stand below the enormous door

969
02:05:08,109 --> 02:05:09,770
recite the spell

970
02:05:09,789 --> 02:05:18,739
Something something something something something something and the golem has armor you knock firmly on the door

971
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,560
When there is no response you call out I am here to open this gate

972
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:29,500
There is no response you begin to wonder if you have been tricked if there is no gate here at all

973
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:32,819
And it's simply an illusion painted across a solid stone wall

974
02:05:33,510 --> 02:05:38,010
Suddenly you are not alone a phantom voice issues from the wood itself

975
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:43,399
Oh stranger, do you know the spell which controls the gate?

976
02:05:43,579 --> 02:05:49,880
Uh, no, I do not

977
02:05:52,670 --> 02:05:59,260
Then the gate denies you from across the clearing you hear a scrabbling sound of metal moving over stone

978
02:05:59,579 --> 02:06:07,710
You look around but see nothing. Look at the shadows. Look along the track. Look at the well

979
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:13,859
You look over at the well and catch a flash of moonlight on a metal blade

980
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,930
It is the hooked claw of a grappling hook

981
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:21,399
Attached to the edge of the well shaft as you watch a face emerges

982
02:06:21,399 --> 02:06:24,800
It bears the leering hook tooth smile of a goblin

983
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,329
The creature is climbing a rope with a grappling hook attached which is hooked over the lip of the well

984
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:36,779
Attack hide you turn to run aiming to find somewhere you can hide and watch what unfolds

985
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:40,920
But then you realize that you are running for your life as goblin after goblin

986
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,840
Clammers from the well and begins to race across the clearing towards you

987
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,050
There's no way you can fight a hundred goblins

988
02:06:46,050 --> 02:06:55,199
So you dash aside into the shadows the goblins pour up to the gate are they going to try to ram it?

989
02:06:55,319 --> 02:07:00,399
But then they stop and in their midst a small figure is being propelled forward

990
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:02,279
You cannot clearly see him

991
02:07:02,279 --> 02:07:08,479
But he is wearing a dull metal circlet on his brow which he clutches as though it was keeping him safe

992
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:12,989
They're king perhaps but since when have goblins had a king

993
02:07:13,050 --> 02:07:21,609
He is surrounded by a guard of nearby nearly 20 goblins as though he was indeed precious kill the figure

994
02:07:21,649 --> 02:07:27,449
All right, let's go wherever this goblin king is he needs to be stopped. Oh

995
02:07:36,170 --> 02:07:40,420
I had a grenade. There's a lava grenade over there. Uh

996
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,340
Yo

997
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:59,380
What happens here you cast the spell?

998
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:04,100
Throwing down a Giants tooth which erupts into smoke a moment later

999
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:10,699
A giant is standing in the middle of the clearing it grabs a fistful of goblins and tosses them away over the wall

1000
02:08:10,779 --> 02:08:15,100
Then grabs the goblin king in its fist and raises him up into the air

1001
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:21,470
He looks to you for instructions toss him away crush him

1002
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:35,510
Crush him crush him. Um, should I crush him? No, I can't I need to know who I need to get info

1003
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:40,140
He I love that. He looks to you for instruction like um

1004
02:08:40,659 --> 02:08:52,140
Well, what do you want me to do with this guy put him down put him down you need to

1005
02:08:52,819 --> 02:09:00,300
You should put him down do a 1v1 PvP. Yeah, I can 1v1 PvP this guy think about that

1006
02:09:00,340 --> 02:09:04,979
I've got this giant here all the goblins are gonna fuck with me now

1007
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:11,380
I'm gonna put him down put him down you call them the giant lowers the king back to the ground

1008
02:09:11,619 --> 02:09:17,460
It is enough for his goblin guards to react and they quickly surround him once more and push you back

1009
02:09:17,739 --> 02:09:24,520
More goblins charge the giant clamoring up him and working in a large group to cut his head from his shoulders

1010
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,560
The kick shit we're gonna kill him

1011
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:31,760
The king smiles holding the circle on his head as if it was a source of some kind of power and then he hurries to

1012
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:37,869
The gate leaning down to the lock he whispers something but you cannot hear what he says a moment later

1013
02:09:37,869 --> 02:09:42,649
The gate begins to move it is opening run for the open gate

1014
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:48,329
This is your chance to leave the city you rush forward chanting fearsome sounding

1015
02:09:48,829 --> 02:09:52,590
Liturgy at the top of your lungs to scare the goblins and clear them aside

1016
02:09:52,829 --> 02:09:57,350
You're nearly through when suddenly a great cry goes up from outside the walls

1017
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:04,220
Something is moving out there run you keep pelting madly forward for once

1018
02:10:04,560 --> 02:10:10,359
Simply running madly and not waiting to look around you are almost through the gates when you see what is out there an

1019
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,119
army of marsh goblins

1020
02:10:13,199 --> 02:10:15,359
thousands of them fully armed and

1021
02:10:16,039 --> 02:10:22,960
Stampeding into Carré keep going you try to fight your way forward

1022
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,880
But the invading army pushes you back with a force like an oncoming tide

1023
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:32,449
That sweeps you off your feet and dumps you on the other side of the clearing the incoming

1024
02:10:32,449 --> 02:10:37,369
Goblins spill through the gate filling the clearing and meeting their hill cousins in a loud and violent

1025
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:44,750
Celebration the man with the circlet at the gate cries with glee a new day for Carré begins

1026
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:49,390
He cries clamoring onto the shoulders of a nearby goblin as though about to make a speech

1027
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:57,560
Quite suddenly the goblins that are carrying him let go he cries out as he falls to the ground a sword goes up

1028
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:03,560
Slashing down there is a scream. They have murdered their own king

1029
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:12,579
What is going on here the circlet from his head rolls to your feet the goblins clashing sword on shield look towards the city with

1030
02:11:12,579 --> 02:11:17,800
Violent eyes take the circlet from the way the king was clutching the circlet

1031
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:21,609
You might have thought it was a thing of power perhaps akin to the crown of king itself

1032
02:11:21,609 --> 02:11:27,489
But it is nothing cheap hammered iron it still bears the groove

1033
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:36,550
From when it was once a goblin sword you toss it into the dust go for the gate their attack on Carré is not your concern

1034
02:11:36,829 --> 02:11:45,850
Darting forward through the crowd of creatures you hurt you head for the open gate and the backlands you run for the gate

1035
02:11:45,850 --> 02:11:50,109
But your progress is slow goblins are surging in and they are starting to organize

1036
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:56,640
One a leader of some kind is hoisted up by the others so he can address the crowd

1037
02:12:03,590 --> 02:12:10,420
Suddenly the goblins eyes are turning on you as if they had not seen you before one springs forward

1038
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:14,600
But there are a hundred more behind

1039
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:27,050
You ready your sword the creature rushes towards you you try to gauge his size and make a play for the creature's chest the

1040
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:31,520
Goblin drops back quivering with fear shows his teeth and spits

1041
02:12:34,810 --> 02:12:42,729
Put him down. I haven't gotten over the fact that they cut the Giants head off. That was horrible. That was a lot going on there

1042
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:47,520
um

1043
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:52,609
Crushed him even they were gonna kill him anyways. They would have been happy

1044
02:12:53,170 --> 02:13:05,939
They definitely it doesn't matter all right all right all right you had a full blast. We're gonna go for

1045
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:10,750
shit

1046
02:13:10,750 --> 02:13:13,500
He's not gonna go full blast

1047
02:13:13,779 --> 02:13:16,609
We do it again

1048
02:13:16,609 --> 02:13:29,170
Fuck sorry do it again. Oh my god one point eight one point nine get out of here with this bullshit die

1049
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:35,300
shameful oh

1050
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:44,319
God damn it. Okay. All right all right all right. Oh come on the other one attacked immediately

1051

1054
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:31,239
He's he's he's going to go full the Goblin hefts its sword, but it looks a little tired

1055
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:33,579

1056
02:14:33,579 --> 02:14:37,680
Yeah, all right. That's good. We're good. We're good good now. We go full blast

1057
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:42,630
Come on like you gotta be shitting me

1058
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,590
Really?

1059
02:14:44,590 --> 02:14:50,470
My god you beat me by point one what the fuck

1060
02:14:51,069 --> 02:14:53,949
That's such dog shit. That's dog shit

1061
02:14:54,569 --> 02:15:03,600
Okay, it stares at your stance

1062
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:10,640
six oh

1063
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:12,000
Fuck off

1064
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:24,760
All right, we're doing low three. How did you get four? He just did his whole bar excuse me. You did your entire bar

1065
02:15:25,479 --> 02:15:29,319
What's that? What are you talking about? How did he get the four Santa points? He did his whole bar

1066
02:15:30,079 --> 02:15:33,850
Yeah, it is sit the fuck down

1067
02:15:35,170 --> 02:15:46,210
More goblins are appearing I can run you cannot keep this up

1068
02:15:46,409 --> 02:15:53,159
Wave after wave of goblin is filling the yard you cannot hope to kill them all with just your sword

1069
02:15:53,319 --> 02:15:57,000
You turn and race away into the shadows then a voice rings out

1070
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:10,789
Stop there is a better way you look around but can see no one but all around you something is happening

1071
02:16:10,789 --> 02:16:16,729
It is as though the goblins have slowed down their warmongering becoming an absurd stately dance

1072
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:20,119
The noise in the clearing dulls to a low rumble

1073
02:16:20,119 --> 02:16:30,529
I command you to stop from the smoke of the torches by the gate a figure emerges

1074
02:16:30,649 --> 02:16:38,299
It is an old man with a long beard and deep black iris eyes

1075
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:44,430
He paces through the churning goblin army to stand in the open his legs disappear into a spectral trail

1076
02:16:44,610 --> 02:16:50,809
He is at least part Wraith step forward he commands and you find yourself

1077
02:16:51,370 --> 02:17:04,680
Bidden the goblins seem to part around you like smoke as you approach the figure. I have aligned three stars

1078
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:14,110
Vic rises tonight the goblins show their hand tonight, but also you you are here tonight

1079
02:17:14,469 --> 02:17:23,229
My name is Lorag I was once a scholar and a noble of the city later

1080
02:17:23,229 --> 02:17:36,870
I founded it you founded it later. Who is this crazed shade? I saw Kari was falling

1081
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:44,979
Sansus had lost his mind and sided with the goblins council was in ruins my life

1082
02:17:45,139 --> 02:17:50,200
My own life was threatened. I saw that Kari needed to be saved

1083
02:17:50,440 --> 02:18:01,520
So I went back to remake it in a way that could be saved and here we are now

1084
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:06,600
You've been here two days. I've been here hundreds of years

1085
02:18:07,809 --> 02:18:10,370
Waiting for you to bring me the spell for the gate

1086
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:18,860
The gate is already open the goblins opened it their leader did

1087
02:18:20,819 --> 02:18:27,799
The spell does not open the gate his tone is heavy and dark like tarred timber

1088
02:18:27,879 --> 02:18:33,549
The spell controls it and there are deep matrix burned into the wood itself

1089
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:38,159
Drupi dog

1090
02:18:42,309 --> 02:18:43,590
Drupi the dog

1091
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:51,120
Burned you know god damn it fuck. I don't care burned into the wood itself

1092
02:18:52,250 --> 02:18:54,370
Magics that have poisoned the city and burnt

1093
02:18:55,649 --> 02:19:02,840
Into the eyeballs of those who live nearby he stares at you his cold black eyes expressing no emotion

1094
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:07,799
The magics I placed there to be used by you

1095
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:16,479
Tonight I am dead. You must act for me. How can I find the spell lines?

1096
02:19:18,469 --> 02:19:20,110
I tried to find them. They were well

1097
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:29,069
They were too hidden the lines are known to four nobles or theta is blind and living in the wastelands of upper Kari

1098
02:19:29,469 --> 02:19:36,940
But malice was a follower of the gods slang and in his shrine near the docks of lower Kari

1099
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:43,079
You may learn his line as for my line. I give it to you freely

1100
02:19:44,520 --> 02:19:54,010
Tumblers to seals deep inside, but there's no more time. It's too late

1101
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:58,520
There is a magic that will give you the time you need

1102
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:04,920
I cast it on myself once and went far back to before this city was built

1103
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:08,719
I found it Kari now you will save it

1104
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:14,540
He waits to let his words sink in if you will allow me

1105
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:22,360
I will blend time itself so that you may return to the city and find the spell for the gate

1106
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:28,500
So shall you take the adventure or will you leave Kari to burn?

1107
02:20:29,819 --> 02:20:38,059
Understand I will curse you and the journey to follow if you do not assist me you hesitate

1108
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:43,459
Kari is a city of traps, but also of secrets. There's still more that you might find

1109
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:56,100
Can you afford to let the city burn so this is what happens if I say?

1110
02:20:56,500 --> 02:21:04,610
Yes, continue the search we go boom and the whole map is reset

1111
02:21:04,829 --> 02:21:11,159
We go back to the very beginning we can then go and pass we did not go and get the actual lines

1112
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:17,500
To open the door we can do that we can do the whole thing again, and we can go find the lines or

1113
02:21:18,059 --> 02:21:20,620
We can just leave Kari

1114
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:24,170
We don't you don't need the lines you don't have to get the spell lines

1115
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:33,469
But if you do leave Kari, and you say I don't care let the place burn let the goblins kill it Lorag

1116
02:21:34,989 --> 02:21:39,969
Becomes your god, and you can never replace him, and he's a piece of shit

1117
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:52,780
That's what we're dealing with here should we try to save the city or do we just keep going say fuck it move on?

1118
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:54,420
That's spoilers

1119
02:21:54,420 --> 02:22:03,239
I mean it's a pretty important spoiler that if we just leave we leave and if we and that

1120
02:22:03,559 --> 02:22:11,739
That's a very important spoiler, but doing going rewinding and going back to the beginning

1121
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,659
Yeah, it means there's more content here

1122
02:22:14,659 --> 02:22:20,500
But we do have to play through and find them and if we don't find them through the second time if we don't get the other

1123
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:22,280
two lines

1124
02:22:22,280 --> 02:22:27,959
Then we get back here, and he's just like yeah, fuck you you can't do it, and we just leave and it's over anyways

1125
02:22:28,079 --> 02:22:36,520
I'm gonna leave it up to you guys. Let's put a poll in the chat

1126
02:22:37,469 --> 02:22:42,590
By the way abandoned car we go on to the third episode we go on to the third game

1127
02:22:42,590 --> 02:22:50,420
So this is either stay in episode 2 or move on to episode 3 with some repercussions

1128
02:22:50,500 --> 02:23:07,389
What do you think go back save the city get that go get the spell lines because we have some clues now

1129
02:23:07,389 --> 02:23:15,129
Or just let's go and move on to the next game. We can do it. We can do it

1130
02:23:15,209 --> 02:23:36,540
Okay back to the future. We need to get that legendary sword. Did you would you last time I?

1131
02:23:37,399 --> 02:23:39,680
Abandoned car a last time that's what I did last time

1132
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:42,739
I just walked through and I said fuck it whatever

1133
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:46,100
And live with the repercussions for the rest of the game

1134
02:23:46,139 --> 02:23:52,569
We did not go back and get the lines last time yes

1135
02:23:52,569 --> 02:23:58,450
You keep everything you keep all of your items you keep all your money literally nothing changes besides you go back to the very beginning

1136
02:23:58,610 --> 02:24:00,649
Here or actually maybe here

1137
02:24:00,649 --> 02:24:06,819
I forget where they put you but then we can use the clues to go and find

1138
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:15,760
The two places where we need to find the lines because Lorag just gave us his all right. Yeah, we're going back all right

1139
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:28,319
Let us go back continue the search. I will help you. I thank you ready yourself

1140
02:24:28,379 --> 02:24:35,790
He raises his arm and begins the spell the raging goblins stand like statues

1141
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:42,729
You feel yourself lifting up from your body as though you've been snatched away by birdmen as you lift into the air you hear

1142
02:24:42,729 --> 02:24:44,969
Lorag cry out one last piece of advice

1143
02:24:45,409 --> 02:24:50,799
Find the lines and find the order of the lines

1144
02:24:51,399 --> 02:24:56,229
Karate dwindles beneath you and you feel your body growing weaker oh

1145
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:11,559
You get to decide where to go all right all right. What are the clues? What are the clues?

1146
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:23,920
You were given a clue about the backlands for sleeping okay now. That's the backlands of the next episode

1147
02:25:24,819 --> 02:25:31,620
Lord malice Lord malice is one of the nobles of Kari, but where is he okay?

1148
02:25:31,620 --> 02:25:33,620
Lord theta is in the ruins

1149
02:25:34,139 --> 02:25:38,780
What theta can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city?

1150
02:25:39,139 --> 02:25:44,520
Was the fallen quarter of the city

1151
02:25:49,809 --> 02:25:50,930
Fallen quarter

1152
02:25:50,930 --> 02:26:02,260
What was the other one priest at the shrine of slang might be able to help you find the spell lines the gate the shrine is

1153
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:14,360
Located between the well and the docks in lower Kari so the well and the docks of lower Kari which is

1154
02:26:14,879 --> 02:26:42,969
Here or here it literally says the well was is between the well yeah lower Kari though where we drop in

1155
02:26:42,969 --> 02:26:54,870
Yeah, but where do you want to go first should we go to the well? Yeah?

1156
02:26:54,870 --> 02:27:04,629
It's right here. There were yes. We get to go back in time all right

1157
02:27:04,629 --> 02:27:08,549
You get what I guess it really doesn't matter because that way we can go back twice all right, so we're gonna

1158
02:27:08,549 --> 02:27:09,750
Go here you ready

1159
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:21,299
We got to go find who we're looking for shrine of slang located between the well

1160
02:27:21,299 --> 02:27:35,000
We don't look at the shrine of slang or go to the festival

1161
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:40,440
I guess we could go here and go up through the festival if you wanted to see the festival

1162
02:27:40,440 --> 02:27:48,040
I have literally one health. Oh, hey, maybe that's something you do in your game. Maybe you do your game

1163
02:27:48,159 --> 02:27:53,709
Maybe you go to them. Maybe you go do all this we didn't do any of this fallen quarters down here

1164
02:27:53,790 --> 02:28:06,190
So we've we would need to start how would we get over here all right whole time are we gonna do be like?

1165
02:28:06,809 --> 02:28:09,690
festivals festival into the fall and quarter or

1166
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:20,840
Well to go to the shrine because I'm imagining it's probably an opportunity for us to go like this

1167
02:28:21,239 --> 02:28:23,729
Right or even go like this

1168
02:28:23,729 --> 02:28:25,930
That's possible, too

1169
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:31,889
This just kind of skips us over here and goes a wham and we might be able to go wham wham

1170
02:28:32,090 --> 02:28:41,979
Ready when I start the fields of the well we might we probably can get both if we go from yeah

1171
02:28:41,979 --> 02:28:43,979
We can probably go

1172
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:46,500
Or if we start here we can go

1173
02:28:48,940 --> 02:29:08,569
Now let me get a poll in chat. I'm gonna say well or fields where we gone. Oh, it's already with okay

1174
02:29:08,569 --> 02:29:37,860
It's already there fields well this does not count as a rewind it does not okay, okay?

1175
02:29:38,020 --> 02:29:44,579
It's still not it's pretty close. I'm

1176
02:29:56,309 --> 02:30:17,559
Going in five seconds. I don't think it's still it's only it's like 200 votes. That's not that much okay? That's it

1177
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,180
We're going to the fields three two one

1178
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:39,209
Like penis music you are being wretched in directions

1179
02:30:39,209 --> 02:30:42,370
You did not know existed the pain is unbearable

1180
02:30:42,370 --> 02:30:46,059
And just when you think you will go mad from it the forces tear you apart

1181
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:51,479
You struggle to grab onto your belongings in your very self as you tumble down from the clouds

1182
02:30:51,479 --> 02:31:00,219
And then you are awake your eyes open once more your surroundings have changed you wake click you wake quickly from sleep

1183
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:02,500
Your journey must continue

1184
02:31:02,500 --> 02:31:08,379
There's no time to lose following the track for a few minutes you reach a junction where three roads begin

1185
02:31:08,459 --> 02:31:10,620
These are the outskirts of caray

1186
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:16,729
That's huddled like beggars on either side of the tracks leading uphill into the city port time to choose your road

1187
02:31:17,069 --> 02:31:22,329
Somewhere in the city must be the information you need to find the spell lines for the north gate that the innkeeper told you

1188
02:31:22,329 --> 02:31:28,459
About just at that moment a cart rolls down the road from the right and careens around a corner to take the main track ahead

1189
02:31:28,899 --> 02:31:35,680
This time however the crates on it wobble, but do not fall and it disappears up the road leaving nothing behind

1190
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:47,799
Interesting it seems not everything is fixed after all remember when we got the blimberry juice. It's different. It's different

1191
02:31:49,649 --> 02:32:00,500
Speaking of that I need to drink something. I am I look at my health. I mean I'm just gonna take them both I

1192
02:32:01,059 --> 02:32:04,469
Need them both

1193
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:09,270
All right, so you guys wanted to go towards the festival right? Oh?

1194
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:13,940
Shit, I didn't want to do I didn't want to drink them both

1195
02:32:14,479 --> 02:32:29,850
Yeah, I should I should that was my mistake. That's a mistake rewind. That's a mistake rewind cuz I can do the doc's bill, okay?

1196
02:32:30,649 --> 02:32:38,049
Let's head towards the festival we need to end up in the fallen quarter or up at uh up at the well here

1197
02:32:38,209 --> 02:32:40,399
So we've got to find our way up

1198
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:52,500
We're gonna go to the festival you head right along a wide track until you reach a large hut

1199
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:58,209
It is the only building on this path that is still standing either side are empty plots

1200
02:32:58,450 --> 02:33:04,340
Once the houses of the farmers who planted the fields to the north and now collapsed and thick with grip weed

1201
02:33:04,459 --> 02:33:06,979
It seems that here in the shadow of the city wall

1202
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:15,069
It's not a place people choose to live by the side of the door by the side of the door to the hut is a sign

1203
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:23,180
Delicately painted chainmaker the door is just a crack a jar and from within you hear a gentle tinkling sound

1204
02:33:23,620 --> 02:33:33,659
Metal on metal as though a creature in a chainmail dress was endlessly pacing the floor listen at the door

1205
02:33:33,940 --> 02:33:36,920
You pause a moment longer and listen closely to the door

1206
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:40,260
But there are no voices or footsteps from within just the sound of the chains

1207
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:49,489
From somewhere further on comes the falling and rising sound of a crowd some kind of event is taking place

1208
02:33:49,610 --> 02:33:57,920
There are several places you could go next so we could uh, we're not going this way

1209
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:03,690
So it's either go into the chainmaker hut cut through the fields or walk on the path

1210
02:34:04,209 --> 02:34:19,579
Let's go in here. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go to the chainmaker you push open the hut door and enter

1211
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:25,479
It is dark inside the floor is sawdust and the air smells of oil

1212
02:34:25,479 --> 02:34:32,120
Oil polish and burnt metal from the ceiling hanging like ivy are metal chains of all lengths and thickness

1213
02:34:32,479 --> 02:34:39,719
Some suitable for machinery some for oxygen and others for arms and feet the chains shift and whisper to themselves

1214
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:45,200
There seems to be no one here. There's another room beyond its door is hanging open

1215
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:55,350
Call out a greeting search the room. Try the far door

1216
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:04,319
Hello, I'm here

1217
02:35:04,319 --> 02:35:09,540
BDSM house try the far door

1218
02:35:11,989 --> 02:35:15,510
Let's get some loot. No shop owner and car

1219
02:35:15,510 --> 02:35:17,510
I should leave their wares unattended

1220
02:35:17,510 --> 02:35:23,299
Steal from him would be to teach him a lesson you begin to carefully search the room trying not to set the chains to

1221
02:35:23,299 --> 02:35:35,399
Rattling now a god left wall under the table far door

1222
02:35:35,879 --> 02:35:37,889
Near the door to the shop

1223
02:35:37,889 --> 02:35:47,030
I'm gonna say near the door to the shop searching around near the door to the shop

1224
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:53,110
You find a copper key. It is carefully stashed into a crack in the wall as though secret and valuable

1225
02:35:53,110 --> 02:36:02,440
It is far too small to be the key to the shop door you take it and put it in your pack nice nice

1226
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:07,219
um

1227
02:36:07,219 --> 02:36:26,149
Under the table or just stop I'm gonna get caught. Why am I doing the same thing? I did earlier

1228
02:36:26,149 --> 02:36:27,629
I never went I didn't go down here

1229
02:36:27,629 --> 02:36:33,500
You mean the place right that from like five years ago did I do the same thing?

1230
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:46,479
We haven't been here in this playthrough search along the wall as you move across the room

1231
02:36:46,479 --> 02:36:51,639
You stumble clumsily into a chain and it begins to swing hitting other chains on either side

1232
02:36:51,639 --> 02:36:58,159
The far door opens in a spin a man orc from Torrapani appears and it looks like he is angry

1233
02:36:58,319 --> 02:37:05,040
The chain maker growls fiercely and snatches up a particularly heavy length of metal holding it like it was a thread

1234
02:37:06,530 --> 02:37:08,530
Talk my way out of this

1235
02:37:08,610 --> 02:37:18,290
What can we do?

1236
02:37:18,290 --> 02:37:24,260
sharpen blade

1237
02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:26,260
I mean I could throw a fireball at the guy

1238
02:37:30,040 --> 02:37:31,399
fix

1239
02:37:31,399 --> 02:37:33,399
Cause fixness. Oh

1240
02:37:38,309 --> 02:37:39,270
mud

1241
02:37:39,270 --> 02:37:44,680
quicksand

1242
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:46,680
I'm gonna I'm gonna talk my way out of it

1243
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:56,739
I'm gonna talk my way out of it. I don't I don't have enough. Look at my stamina. I'm not stealing from you

1244
02:37:57,139 --> 02:38:03,670
You reply calmly I called out, but you didn't hear me. I heard nothing

1245
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:15,590
Exactly the chain maker stops and thinks about this. I understand. All right, you want chains

1246
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:23,010
It worked look for a chain to buy he's worthless

1247
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:23,409
All right

1248
02:38:23,409 --> 02:38:26,020
What do you got?

1249
02:38:26,020 --> 02:38:32,629
You look around the shop a chain after unremarkable chain then one stands out a short length of silver

1250
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:39,190
Which seems to move more energetically than the one swaying on either side the chain maker nods good chain

1251
02:38:39,670 --> 02:38:45,969
Magic chain, what does it do magic?

1252
02:38:48,930 --> 02:39:01,190
How much does it cost he sizes you up thinking you must be wealthy. It's five gold pieces. I'll take it

1253
02:39:01,430 --> 02:39:08,819
I'll buy it you hand over the five gold pieces. He wants happy that three of those five pieces are his anyway

1254
02:39:11,409 --> 02:39:16,819
Oh, yeah, that's right. You shake the chain maker's hand and take the chain

1255
02:39:17,219 --> 02:39:21,860
It is clearly enchanted the ends seem to snap and bite at one another like a snake

1256
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:26,479
Good for taking out their knees

1257
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:42,440
Okay, is this a weapon it is a weapon really that's all right. That's cool

1258
02:39:45,959 --> 02:39:47,159
We have a

1259
02:39:47,159 --> 02:39:53,989
Chain as a weapon though. Okay

1260
02:39:53,989 --> 02:39:58,500
Uh, should I cut through the field or should I just walk on the road? I'm gonna walk on the road, right?

1261
02:39:59,139 --> 02:40:04,420
I don't have enough health to like step on a beehive or land in a trap or something

1262
02:40:04,659 --> 02:40:16,440
I'm gonna take the road you continue along the road land rises gently

1263
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:21,329
Thin meager scrub broken by rocky outcrops like teeth through an infant's gum

1264
02:40:22,020 --> 02:40:26,020
Goats roam the slopes paranoid shifty creatures who flee at the sound of your footsteps

1265
02:40:26,579 --> 02:40:33,139
Suddenly you could be back in the fields outside kristin tonti. This part of the city port is barely habited

1266
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:36,100
So you're unlikely to find clues to the north gate spell here

1267
02:40:36,879 --> 02:40:39,120
There will be more people to talk to near the docks

1268
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:44,920
You continue walking along the track and begin to hear the sound of a large crowd up ahead

1269
02:40:45,239 --> 02:40:48,760
There's some kind of market or fair happening further on near the river

1270
02:40:49,159 --> 02:40:52,200
You pass a dirt track on the left that leads away across the field

1271
02:40:52,520 --> 02:41:00,120
Yeah, we'll head right you guys wanted to we wanted to the festival we're gonna do the festival

1272
02:41:06,450 --> 02:41:12,290
You continue along the road towards the noise after a few minutes. You are walking between tall poles and rippling colored flags

1273
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:14,450
people and creatures

1274
02:41:14,450 --> 02:41:19,889
Sprawl across the path and several tents have been erected the poles joined together by more flags

1275
02:41:21,170 --> 02:41:23,729
You ease your way into the edge of the gathered crowd. It looks

1276
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:29,489
All good spirited and fun and with so many people here. Perhaps you will pick up useful information about the spell lines

1277
02:41:32,079 --> 02:41:36,290
Listen you mill through the crowd keeping your ears open for anything interesting

1278
02:41:36,610 --> 02:41:39,649
But most people in the center of the field are arguing over where to go next

1279
02:41:40,049 --> 02:41:45,250
Or lamenting how many gold pieces they have spent you might do better to have a closer look at something

1280
02:41:47,409 --> 02:41:49,409
Okay, this is through the end of the midway

1281
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:58,819
You walk to the south end of the fairground midway a boy with a barrel stands off to one side

1282
02:41:59,459 --> 02:42:01,459
There are more exciting stalls further north

1283
02:42:03,879 --> 02:42:05,559
barrel boy

1284
02:42:05,559 --> 02:42:07,559
Or in the middle of the midway

1285
02:42:07,959 --> 02:42:16,840
I mean barrel boy, right?

1286
02:42:16,840 --> 02:42:19,899
You approach a boy standing by a barrel and looking sheepish

1287
02:42:23,569 --> 02:42:29,120
What are you selling the boy points into his barrel but doesn't answer

1288
02:42:31,489 --> 02:42:33,090
Look in the barrel

1289
02:42:33,090 --> 02:42:36,049
You peer into the barrel. It is full of small hard apples

1290
02:42:36,530 --> 02:42:38,530
Most are blackened by disease

1291
02:42:39,170 --> 02:42:41,569
Or else are shot through with maggot holes

1292
02:42:43,559 --> 02:42:46,020
Your apples are all rotten

1293
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:47,700
The boy shakes his head

1294
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:52,020
Then picks one up from the barrel he squeezes it hard in his fist, but nothing happens

1295
02:42:52,659 --> 02:42:55,030
And he drops it sharply back into the bucket

1296
02:42:59,379 --> 02:43:03,110
uh

1297
02:43:03,110 --> 02:43:06,239
Um, why don't you speak?

1298
02:43:06,399 --> 02:43:09,649
The boy shrugs but doesn't seem to want to answer properly

1299
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:12,979
How much is an apple?

1300
02:43:12,979 --> 02:43:16,500
You ask despite the fact that it's hard to imagine anyone paying for one

1301
02:43:17,299 --> 02:43:21,780
The boy holds up a single finger with one hand and all five fingers of the other

1302
02:43:24,549 --> 02:43:26,549
One gold for five apples

1303
02:43:27,510 --> 02:43:32,440
The boy nods

1304
02:43:33,159 --> 02:43:34,979
Five

1305
02:43:34,979 --> 02:43:36,260
I'll take it

1306
02:43:36,260 --> 02:43:39,299
You hand over a gold piece and the boy supplies you with five apples

1307
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:43,760
In your hands you feel that they are indeed not rotten

1308
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:48,079
In fact, they are rock solid hardened by some disease into stones

1309
02:43:49,059 --> 02:43:51,059
The boy bows his head in thanks

1310
02:43:51,620 --> 02:43:53,620
And then gestures behind him

1311
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:58,500
A girl possibly his sister pops up from behind another barrel and pulls a face at you

1312
02:44:00,840 --> 02:44:02,840
Throw an apple at her

1313
02:44:04,340 --> 02:44:09,139
Like I just full baseball pitcher throw this into this girl's face

1314
02:44:12,579 --> 02:44:14,579
Why would I do that? That's horrible

1315
02:44:18,319 --> 02:44:21,040
I'm gonna cause mayhem if I do that, you know that right?

1316
02:44:23,649 --> 02:44:25,649
Stick my tongue out. Yeah, i'm gonna go

1317
02:44:28,290 --> 02:44:31,489
Guys i'm not baseball throwing a rock at a little girl's head

1318
02:44:32,440 --> 02:44:35,959
I'm, sorry you you have a playthrough you can do that in your playthrough. That's not happening here

1319
02:44:38,209 --> 02:44:41,889
I am not going to full baseball pitcher from the mound

1320
02:44:42,450 --> 02:44:47,250
Throw one foot away from me a rock into at some at some girl. I'm not doing that

1321
02:44:47,969 --> 02:44:50,520
I'm, sorry

1322
02:44:50,520 --> 02:45:02,360
You did it last time

1323
02:45:03,239 --> 02:45:06,120
You stick your tongue out the girl giggles and then dodges behind the barrel

1324
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:09,399
The boy looks at you expectantly the girl peeks up again

1325
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:12,840
I'm waiting for her head to pick up

1326
02:45:14,129 --> 02:45:15,569
Is that your sister?

1327
02:45:15,569 --> 02:45:17,569
You ask pointing the girl's direction

1328
02:45:17,729 --> 02:45:21,329
Boy nods and then takes an apple from his barrel and throws it across the field

1329
02:45:21,809 --> 02:45:23,809
His sister dodges quickly out of the way

1330
02:45:33,969 --> 02:45:38,770
You lob one of your apples at the girl, but she dives to one side and it misses the boy claps his hands

1331
02:45:39,409 --> 02:45:42,049
The girl sticks her arms out at either side then quickly ducks

1332
02:45:45,299 --> 02:45:47,940
You ready your second apple and wait for the girl to show herself

1333
02:45:48,340 --> 02:45:51,780
As soon as she pops up you throw but your aim is off and you miss by a finger's breath

1334
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:54,100
The girl giggles and ducks away out of sight

1335
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:06,200
I I've I didn't mean to do that. I was trying to throw it again. I've can I rewind I fucked up

1336
02:46:07,010 --> 02:46:09,809
It's waste i'm wasting apples. I'm I want all five apples

1337
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:18,200
Wait, I toss them all into the mud

1338
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:23,219
You walk away as you go you try biting into an apple and almost crack one of your teeth

1339
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:26,100
They're completely inedible. You toss all of them into the mud

1340
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:30,200
What no go back

1341
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:43,360
Go back go back go back

1342
02:46:43,360 --> 02:46:48,450
Six gold pieces one piece for five apples. Okay. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

1343
02:46:50,209 --> 02:46:52,159
Stick my tongue out

1344
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:53,920
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1345
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:56,389
All right. Here we go, bro

1346
02:46:56,389 --> 02:46:57,959
Throw another

1347
02:46:57,959 --> 02:47:01,879
Okay, throw another you try another throw, but your aim is really terrible

1348
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:08,280
Perhaps if you spent more time practicing your sword fighting and physical skills and less learning book magic your arm would be better

1349
02:47:09,079 --> 02:47:12,440
Your hand you hand back your remaining blackened apples to the boy

1350
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:16,360
He grabs the apples and throws them at his sister and you walk back into the midway

1351
02:47:17,159 --> 02:47:18,040
what

1352
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:23,829
The fair spreads out all around you a collection of booths and what I is that a like a strength check

1353
02:47:24,389 --> 02:47:28,680
I don't get it. I just wasted a dollar

1354
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:34,100
There's just a hint of violence and an atmosphere of cheerfulness

1355
02:47:37,360 --> 02:47:38,479
what

1356
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:41,750
All those fancy books

1357
02:47:41,829 --> 02:47:49,159
All right into the midway

1358
02:47:49,159 --> 02:47:53,479
You push your way through the crowds to the very heart of the fair and look around at the attractions to offer

1359
02:47:56,290 --> 02:47:58,770
A beer tent the dancing bear

1360
02:47:59,329 --> 02:48:04,120
Let's go to the beer tent

1361
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:07,159
Just by the river is a low tent surrounded by several stumbling figures

1362
02:48:07,719 --> 02:48:13,479
It could almost be a tent for dancing except for the strong smell of brewed grain that drifts over the air

1363
02:48:14,360 --> 02:48:19,879
In the stall a group of three half goblin women are pouring mugs of beer and talking to the locals

1364
02:48:20,440 --> 02:48:25,079
The sign reads one mug one gold four mugs six gold

1365
02:48:29,299 --> 02:48:34,610
That's doesn't make any sense

1366
02:48:34,610 --> 02:48:39,969
Smell the air you pause to inhale the rich smell of brewed grains that hangs around the tent

1367
02:48:40,530 --> 02:48:42,290
It is quite nourishing

1368
02:48:42,290 --> 02:48:44,290
One of the bar women catches your smile

1369
02:48:48,079 --> 02:48:49,520
Nice. Yes

1370
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:52,719
Even nicer in a glass

1371
02:48:52,719 --> 02:48:56,559
Tall spiny creature raises his voice to announce. He is buying four mugs

1372
02:48:57,299 --> 02:48:59,479
A huge cheer goes up

1373
02:48:59,479 --> 02:49:01,479
But mostly from the women behind the bar

1374
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:15,799
Um, I don't know. I'm gonna run out of money

1375
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:22,200
You elbow your way to the bar and wave to attract the attention of one of the women

1376
02:49:24,209 --> 02:49:26,389
Gradients, what can I do for you?

1377
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:32,290
Uh, what's on sale? I'll buy some beer. Why are four mugs so expensive?

1378
02:49:33,329 --> 02:49:35,809
You ask isn't it cheaper to buy four separately?

1379
02:49:37,090 --> 02:49:42,209
Oh, no, no, no, it's a special offer you say four mugs for six gold pieces

1380
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:50,290
That's but that's more than buying separately

1381
02:49:53,409 --> 02:49:54,610
Oh

1382
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:58,610
I see your mistake. It's a common one. We should fix the sign

1383
02:49:59,250 --> 02:50:02,659
But she doesn't explain she quickly disappears to serve another customer

1384
02:50:04,389 --> 02:50:06,389
Just then two creatures walk past

1385
02:50:08,079 --> 02:50:10,719
So you say he wasn't dead when they buried him?

1386
02:50:11,360 --> 02:50:12,959
This is the first

1387
02:50:12,959 --> 02:50:15,840
Not quite dead enough undead. You could talk to him

1388
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,100
You move away from the tent to listen to the creatures

1389
02:50:25,409 --> 02:50:26,930
nobles

1390
02:50:26,930 --> 02:50:29,250
Why can't they just stay dead when they get dead?

1391
02:50:30,209 --> 02:50:31,569
Couldn't agree more

1392
02:50:31,569 --> 02:50:35,969
But at least they bury him anyway one less noble for the boss to worry about

1393
02:50:36,899 --> 02:50:41,110
They disappear into the crowd a stocky dwarf knocks into you briefly

1394
02:50:41,909 --> 02:50:44,870
Begging your pardon. He murmurs before slipping away into the crowd

1395
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:49,909
He just took like I stole me. I got robbed

1396
02:50:56,420 --> 02:50:59,299
I don't want I don't remember what this does. I'm fine

1397
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:04,469
You head back over to the tent and wait for a goblin s

1398
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:07,430
I'll buy four you say

1399
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:13,270
The half goblin woman returns with a grin and raises a cry as you pay six gold pieces and she pulls the drinks

1400
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:17,700
He's buying four

1401
02:51:17,700 --> 02:51:20,260
Another lucky customer taking advantage of our offer

1402
02:51:21,139 --> 02:51:23,139
nearby drunks turn their heads

1403
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:28,899
um

1404
02:51:28,899 --> 02:51:36,309
So just share it with everybody. I'll share them you tell the surrounding crowd

1405
02:51:37,030 --> 02:51:39,030
The woman behind the bar nods and murmurs

1406
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:43,360
Good idea. This stuff's a bit too strong to drink a lot of

1407
02:51:44,340 --> 02:52:00,069
She sets down four mugs in front of you. Should I just drink them all? They're all laughing at you

1408
02:52:10,600 --> 02:52:14,280
I don't did I do this last time? I don't drink i'm gonna drink them all

1409
02:52:15,260 --> 02:52:20,959
Selfishly you knock back the first mug then the second then the third and fourth without sharing the mugs around

1410
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:23,600
Despite buying them on offer

1411
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:29,200
Beer is watery and somewhat unpleasant, but you don't really notice the ill effects until a few minutes have passed

1412
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,479
Suddenly your head is swimming and your stomach is turning over

1413
02:52:33,969 --> 02:52:38,129
I had two more chat view. Well, why don't you settle your stomach with another?

1414
02:52:40,260 --> 02:52:42,979
I feel terrible. You've poisoned me sure

1415
02:52:44,149 --> 02:52:48,549
Too far under the influence to not to agree you buy another mug of beer and drain it

1416
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:50,870
Now you feel really bad

1417
02:52:50,870 --> 02:52:54,709
And your head and stomach are swirling like you've been faced down in a cesspool

1418
02:52:55,510 --> 02:53:00,229
As you staggered away from the hut stumbling over your feet you look back and see a wide pipe

1419
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:04,950
Running from the back of the tent and directly into the jibaji river

1420
02:53:05,909 --> 02:53:09,750
The last thing you realize is that the beer isn't beer at all, but river water

1421
02:53:10,389 --> 02:53:14,040
You've been poisoned with river water. I'm dead

1422
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:30,840
I'll drink them all i'll drink them all and they're all mine. They're all my beers. Nobody can have them

1423
02:53:32,530 --> 02:53:39,760
And they're all like dude. All right, go for it. Oh my god. He actually bought four

1424
02:53:41,079 --> 02:53:43,079
Yeah, fuck you. I'm drinking them all

1425
02:53:44,420 --> 02:53:50,739
Yeah, but what smelling the air is delicious, but apparently so what what am I smelling that heals me for one health?

1426
02:53:53,840 --> 02:53:58,319
I'm gonna buy one mug

1427
02:53:58,319 --> 02:54:02,719
Paying a gold piece you buy a frothing mug of beer. The air looks muddy and somewhat disgusting

1428
02:54:02,719 --> 02:54:04,479
It doesn't taste like beer at all

1429
02:54:04,479 --> 02:54:08,479
This isn't beer

1430
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:10,479
Excuse me. Uh, what is this?

1431
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:15,379
Finest beer from her expression. She isn't telling the whole truth

1432
02:54:16,709 --> 02:54:19,969
You drink some

1433
02:54:19,969 --> 02:54:22,930
Oh, I wish I could but I can't drink while working

1434
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:27,879
Yes, then another customer rolls up his nose bright red and his eyes soggy

1435
02:54:29,270 --> 02:54:30,389
I'll

1436
02:54:30,389 --> 02:54:32,149
Buy it for you

1437
02:54:32,149 --> 02:54:34,709
He puts 10 gold pieces down on the counter

1438
02:54:35,889 --> 02:54:38,930
enough for all six of you behind the bar

1439
02:54:39,649 --> 02:54:41,250
To you he remarks

1440
02:54:41,250 --> 02:54:43,190
cannily

1441
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:46,149
Three sets of twins remarkable, isn't it?

1442
02:54:46,709 --> 02:54:48,709
Steal the money and run out of the league

1443
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:51,840
Make her drink some

1444
02:54:53,540 --> 02:54:57,379
No, no, no, no, excuse me. Excuse me miss to have some of that have some

1445
02:54:58,790 --> 02:55:02,209
Have some

1446
02:55:02,209 --> 02:55:04,229
Please please have some

1447
02:55:04,229 --> 02:55:08,549
It's your beer. It's delicious. I by the way when I took that sip, I was just kidding

1448
02:55:08,629 --> 02:55:12,629
It's the it's delicious. You should you should have you take a sip have some take a sip of your own beer

1449
02:55:15,399 --> 02:55:17,399
Take half the money and stay quiet

1450
02:55:23,250 --> 02:55:25,569
It's 10 gold. What if I take half of it?

1451
02:55:26,309 --> 02:55:29,319
Take the money and run

1452
02:55:29,319 --> 02:55:31,319
Enough of this you snatch the money from the counter

1453
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:38,440
Thief shouts the woman behind the bar the drunk man and quite a few others turn on you furiously

1454
02:55:40,229 --> 02:55:43,360
don't

1455
02:55:45,170 --> 02:55:47,170
You mess about with our beer

1456
02:55:47,250 --> 02:55:49,969
They cry and jump on you fist pounding fight back

1457
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:55,920
You try to fight back, but the energy of the drunks is furious and they are fearless to boot

1458
02:55:56,319 --> 02:55:59,840
You eventually escape with several cuts bruises and scratches look back

1459
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:06,559
Looking back you notice a pipe running from the tent directly into the jabaji river. It seems a beer isn't beer after all

1460
02:56:08,149 --> 02:56:10,870
Hey, we're good

1461
02:56:10,870 --> 02:56:13,190
murmur of excitement then quite suddenly a small what

1462
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:20,639
From across the field comes a murmur of excitement then quite suddenly a small tornado lifts a tent sharply into the air in a way

1463
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:23,959
I got 10 gold for that

1464
02:56:23,959 --> 02:56:27,239
You can enjoy your your your shit wine. That's fine your poop wine

1465
02:56:28,040 --> 02:56:42,389
I got 10 gold

1466
02:56:42,389 --> 02:56:46,069
You cross the fair to join a crowd gathered at a safe distance around a dancing bear

1467
02:56:46,629 --> 02:56:52,149
A dwarf stands in front of the bear holding a lead that is fastened to a ring in the creature's nose

1468
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:59,139
See my beauty dance he growls jerking the cord the bear stumbles around in obvious pain

1469
02:57:06,450 --> 02:57:10,850
As he tugs the cable he plays a pipe with great gusto

1470
02:57:11,489 --> 02:57:15,010
The crowd are in stitches of laughter at the poor bear's performance

1471
02:57:21,799 --> 02:57:24,450
Really bear I might die doing this

1472
02:57:27,559 --> 02:57:31,920
Hold on you hang around for a moment and watch no fuck you

1473
02:57:32,959 --> 02:57:38,479
Most curious see if the bear will strike down its miserable little owner suddenly a cry goes up from somewhere in the audience

1474
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:42,959
My gold my gold my pick pocket beware. That's a pick pocket at work pick pocket

1475
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:48,159
You and the rest of the crowd spin around towards the voice and see a small creature darting off away from the crowd and into one

1476
02:57:48,159 --> 02:57:53,920
of the tents

1477
02:57:53,920 --> 02:57:56,879
No, fuck you

1478
02:57:56,879 --> 02:58:03,360
With everyone looking in one direction you turn to look in the other and see the dwarf release the cord holding the bear in place

1479
02:58:04,229 --> 02:58:11,270
But the creature does not go wild or attempt to run. In fact, both the dwarf and the bear seem to shrink down to the ground

1480
02:58:13,319 --> 02:58:14,850
What's going on?

1481
02:58:14,850 --> 02:58:16,450
Is this part of the show?

1482
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:23,489
Okay

1483
02:58:23,489 --> 02:58:25,649
Just illusions perhaps

1484
02:58:25,649 --> 02:58:29,889
The crowd are out for blood now. It seems several of them have been robbed

1485
02:58:30,610 --> 02:58:34,049
Turning on one another accusations of theft begin to fly this way and that

1486
02:58:34,930 --> 02:58:39,600
Things are turning ugly and you are caught in the middle of it. See what I can get

1487
02:58:40,899 --> 02:58:42,500
in the tumult

1488
02:58:42,500 --> 02:58:47,459
You wait for an opportunity in every fight. There will always be some gold pouches swinging low for the plucking

1489
02:58:47,860 --> 02:58:53,620
You are knocked about a fair bit as you wait, but finally you see a bulging wallet just inches from your grasp

1490
02:58:55,250 --> 02:58:57,239
Look at the owner

1491
02:58:57,239 --> 02:59:01,399
Glancing up at the owner of the wallet. You find yourself staring into the huge face of a mountain man

1492
02:59:05,620 --> 02:59:07,620
You're a thief are you?

1493
02:59:13,239 --> 02:59:15,239
No, i'm no thief you tell him

1494
02:59:18,260 --> 02:59:20,500
Look at the size of his gold pouch

1495
02:59:21,059 --> 02:59:23,059
Remarks another voice nearby in the crowd

1496
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:29,600
It's a trigger that sends the mountain man who had just been robbed himself into a fearsome rage. Oh god

1497
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:32,479
I have to win. I gotta win every single one of these. Let's go

1498
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:34,639
seven

1499
02:59:34,639 --> 02:59:36,639
Oh fuck

1500
02:59:45,969 --> 02:59:51,489
An instant later the man is thundering down on you arm swinging and he charges with every ounce of his strength knocking you back

1501
02:59:51,969 --> 02:59:54,690
The mountain man swings a final punch that knocks you into the mud

1502
02:59:55,329 --> 02:59:58,690
Then for good measure he stamps on your head and walks away

1503
02:59:59,090 --> 03:00:02,709
He probably doesn't realize that he has broken your skull wide open. Whatever

1504
03:00:03,430 --> 03:00:06,709
defend

1505
03:00:06,709 --> 03:00:08,709
All right, he's gonna come in full blast

1506
03:00:11,700 --> 03:00:14,000
Let's go like eight

1507
03:00:14,079 --> 03:00:16,079
How are you? No, no

1508
03:00:27,559 --> 03:00:29,399
Okay, wait, wait, wait

1509
03:00:29,399 --> 03:00:33,959
You put up your own and circle the mountain man steps back. He's gonna block again. All right

1510
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:40,799
You stay low the crowd around jostle and struggle fighting amongst themselves. He circles

1511
03:00:41,440 --> 03:00:43,440
Through the fighting crowd. He's coming in

1512
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:46,020
He's coming in full blast

1513
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:48,659
Oh my fucking god, dude. What are you talking about?

1514
03:00:49,540 --> 03:00:56,370
i'm dead

1515
03:00:56,370 --> 03:01:04,209
That was three defends in a row. He steps back

1516
03:01:07,479 --> 03:01:09,139
Okay

1517
03:01:09,139 --> 03:01:14,659
He paces left

1518
03:01:14,659 --> 03:01:20,389
He circles right

1519
03:01:20,389 --> 03:01:23,030
He edges back you piece of shit

1520
03:01:24,180 --> 03:01:30,239
Fine take that

1521
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:32,079
Okay, he sneers at me

1522
03:01:32,079 --> 03:01:34,899
Does that mean he's coming in or?

1523
03:01:37,219 --> 03:01:40,500
Does that he's nears at me? Does that mean he's gonna swing?

1524
03:01:45,590 --> 03:01:46,549
Got him

1525
03:01:46,549 --> 03:01:50,180
That was too much though. That was way too much. I'm dead

1526
03:01:52,040 --> 03:01:54,040
Yeah, i'm dead. I literally no

1527
03:01:54,040 --> 03:01:55,319
I'm not dead

1528
03:01:55,319 --> 03:02:01,559
pray to the ape

1529
03:02:01,559 --> 03:02:06,280
We're good five health

1530
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:07,719
Nice, hell, yeah

1531
03:02:07,719 --> 03:02:09,239
Thank god for the ape

1532
03:02:09,239 --> 03:02:13,399
I wouldn't be able to beat that

1533
03:02:13,399 --> 03:02:17,659
Now he dodges back now we go little tiny little bit 2.0

1534
03:02:19,860 --> 03:02:24,229
And that should do it now. We go full blast. He goads you. All right, can I do it?

1535
03:02:24,870 --> 03:02:29,270
Yeah

1536
03:02:29,270 --> 03:02:32,709
You launch at him again. You grab a nearby bottle and break it against his head

1537
03:02:33,270 --> 03:02:35,430
The final punch makes the mountain man's head spin

1538
03:02:37,489 --> 03:02:39,090
Oh, never mind

1539
03:02:39,090 --> 03:02:41,090
He curses throwing up his hands

1540
03:02:41,170 --> 03:02:43,010
Keep your gold thief

1541
03:02:43,010 --> 03:02:46,309
But that he stomps away punching a few other people as he goes

1542
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:50,719
You slither your way back out of the crowd to the main part of the fair

1543
03:02:51,540 --> 03:02:54,979
From somewhere nearby you catch a glimpse of a shadowy figure disappearing behind a tent

1544
03:02:55,540 --> 03:02:57,780
Something about the way it moves is familiar

1545
03:02:57,940 --> 03:03:03,879
I didn't get his gold

1546
03:03:03,879 --> 03:03:05,399
Follow the figure

1547
03:03:05,399 --> 03:03:15,110
Follow the figure you push through the crowd following the dark figure into a narrow gap

1548
03:03:15,750 --> 03:03:17,750
cautiously you enter the narrow space

1549
03:03:18,069 --> 03:03:20,069
And suddenly there is a hand at your throat

1550
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:22,690
I will kill you

1551
03:03:22,690 --> 03:03:24,870
Reads a voice you recognize

1552
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:30,959
You laugh with delight

1553
03:03:30,959 --> 03:03:32,399
It's flanker

1554
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:35,700
The assassin whose life you spared before you reached torapani

1555
03:03:36,799 --> 03:03:38,819
Greetings you declare enthusiastically

1556
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:43,440
Flanker nods he does not smile, but he seems pleased to see you

1557
03:03:44,239 --> 03:03:46,239
Aha my friend and enemy

1558
03:03:46,719 --> 03:03:48,479
I see like myself

1559
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:50,879
You also enjoy the fun of the festival of thieves

1560
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:53,360
But you look in poor shape

1561
03:03:53,360 --> 03:03:56,479
Have others been treating you more roughly than I was able to myself?

1562
03:03:57,200 --> 03:04:01,860
And how have you fared in Kari city is full of devils

1563
03:04:02,420 --> 03:04:06,260
flanker laughs

1564
03:04:06,979 --> 03:04:08,659
It is indeed

1565
03:04:08,659 --> 03:04:11,139
But at least you have not had to face the portal traps

1566
03:04:11,780 --> 03:04:15,459
They'll take your smile and move it to your throat as we assassins say

1567
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:25,600
portal traps

1568
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:27,040
I want your help

1569
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:32,440
flanker nods

1570
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:34,920
Ask of it and I shall do what I can

1571
03:04:36,559 --> 03:04:38,559
Oh, we send him on like an errand

1572
03:04:38,799 --> 03:04:42,799
I've been told to find a priest. I need to find a beggar who is a noble

1573
03:04:42,879 --> 03:04:45,680
Tell me about those portal. I need to know the order of the spell lines

1574
03:04:49,430 --> 03:04:50,229
um

1575
03:04:50,229 --> 03:04:52,229
Probably this one right because that's

1576
03:04:52,709 --> 03:04:59,989
check

1577
03:04:59,989 --> 03:05:00,950
uh

1578
03:05:00,950 --> 03:05:02,950
Lord theta is in the ruins

1579
03:05:05,059 --> 03:05:07,059
So this is the beggar

1580
03:05:07,299 --> 03:05:10,819
So I probably want to know this right?

1581
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:24,959
Or the order I need to find a beggar who was a noble. I need to find the order of the spell lines

1582
03:05:32,819 --> 03:05:33,540
order

1583
03:05:33,540 --> 03:05:36,479
Okay, I need to do the order

1584
03:05:36,479 --> 03:05:37,840
flanker nods

1585
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:42,389
I am told that Sansus did not entrust any of his nobles with the knowledge of their correct order

1586
03:05:43,030 --> 03:05:45,030
It was his final failsafe

1587
03:05:45,030 --> 03:05:47,329
But that does not mean it is not known

1588
03:05:47,569 --> 03:05:49,729
You might appeal to one of the gods to learn

1589
03:05:50,450 --> 03:05:54,239
Which god?

1590
03:05:54,239 --> 03:05:56,879
Slang is not strong enough for such knowledge. I think

1591
03:05:57,440 --> 03:05:59,440
Though you could try his shrine

1592
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:01,670
between the well and the docks

1593
03:06:01,670 --> 03:06:02,790
otherwise

1594
03:06:02,790 --> 03:06:05,920
Corga would know but his temple is by the north gate

1595
03:06:06,479 --> 03:06:11,010
He nods finally, but I must be away. Perhaps I will see you again

1596
03:06:11,889 --> 03:06:17,010
I'll be drinking at the wayfarer's rest tonight in the docks join me if you will i'm getting fucking weirder

1597
03:06:17,569 --> 03:06:19,969
You nod to flanker in return. All right, the wayfarer's rest

1598
03:06:22,840 --> 03:06:25,190
um

1599
03:06:25,190 --> 03:06:27,750
Slang, okay, we need to we're gonna go find slang

1600
03:06:28,309 --> 03:06:32,819
Flang is up here, right?

1601
03:06:32,819 --> 03:06:36,200
Yeah

1602
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:38,200
At the where is it tonight?

1603
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:41,780
The wayfarer's rest. Where was that?

1604
03:06:43,799 --> 03:06:47,319
Go do corga. I can't do corga. I killed someone corga won't talk to me

1605
03:06:47,799 --> 03:06:55,829
You walk to the north end of the fairground midway

1606
03:06:56,389 --> 03:06:58,870
The fair continues from here and a road leads uphill

1607
03:06:59,430 --> 03:07:02,760
Fair knuckle fighting musicians

1608
03:07:04,799 --> 03:07:06,799
Um, let's do the musician

1609
03:07:06,799 --> 03:07:16,790
You head over to where a crowd are watching a troop of dancers who spin and swirl in time to a lively tune

1610
03:07:17,350 --> 03:07:19,350
There's something quite hypnotic about the performance

1611
03:07:28,610 --> 03:07:30,610
Wait, I can do it too

1612
03:07:31,649 --> 03:07:33,649
Let's do it i'll play with them

1613
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:39,700
Cause a stench somebody farted at the concert

1614
03:07:41,110 --> 03:07:45,110
uh the sus

1615
03:07:45,110 --> 03:07:47,110
There's goes slow

1616
03:07:47,909 --> 03:07:50,950
I mean i'm gonna play with them. Yeah, that sounds like the fun thing to do. Let's do it

1617
03:07:51,590 --> 03:07:56,770
You cast the spell and begin to play your pipe

1618
03:07:57,090 --> 03:08:01,510
With the other dancers already setting a wonderful mood the spell's effects are magnified

1619
03:08:02,049 --> 03:08:05,409
And soon the entire crowd is dancing and jigging with each other

1620
03:08:05,889 --> 03:08:12,770
It is quite a sight a hundred of kare strange and wonderful creatures all waving their arms and stamping their feet

1621
03:08:13,489 --> 03:08:15,489
after about half an hour

1622
03:08:15,569 --> 03:08:20,370
The crowd grows tired and wanders off arm in arm and claw in claw

1623
03:08:20,930 --> 03:08:22,930
To see the other attractions of the fair

1624
03:08:23,649 --> 03:08:25,649
One of the musicians approaches you

1625
03:08:26,239 --> 03:08:27,600
nice work

1626
03:08:27,600 --> 03:08:30,719
Not often we get a talented amateur for the thieves dance

1627
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:33,440
The crowd will think you were a stooge

1628
03:08:36,549 --> 03:08:43,649
Oh the thieves dance

1629
03:08:43,649 --> 03:08:45,170
The musician shrugs

1630
03:08:45,170 --> 03:08:46,370
It's just a name

1631
03:08:46,370 --> 03:08:48,530
He looks you over with a cany eye

1632
03:08:49,350 --> 03:08:52,309
Pack sword battle scars. You're not from kare. Are you?

1633
03:08:53,250 --> 03:08:55,250
Not just here to enjoy the fair

1634
03:08:56,799 --> 03:08:59,620
I'm visiting my father

1635
03:09:02,180 --> 03:09:03,940
Just visiting my dad

1636
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:10,930
Maybe you can help me

1637
03:09:10,930 --> 03:09:16,719
Maybe you can help

1638
03:09:16,719 --> 03:09:21,000
Yeah, maybe I can

1639
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:25,959
The musician drops down to the dirt and puts his hand out. My name is jira and it's good to meet you

1640
03:09:27,879 --> 03:09:29,600
You shake his hand

1641
03:09:29,600 --> 03:09:34,319
So you helped us get enough coins to pay for our night. How can I help you?

1642
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:40,079
I need to open the north gate or I need somewhere to stay

1643
03:09:42,040 --> 03:09:44,159
I'm probably gonna say that

1644
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:47,280
Because we we know what we need to go for the spell lines

1645
03:09:48,229 --> 03:09:50,229
But I've really my health is terrible

1646
03:09:52,770 --> 03:09:56,469
I need somewhere to stay

1647
03:09:56,469 --> 03:10:02,229
Well, you have to be careful in ins of kare some of them work in commission for the slavers if you know what I mean

1648
03:10:02,790 --> 03:10:06,069
He smiles sadly and for some reason taps his forearm as he speaks

1649
03:10:07,520 --> 03:10:11,040
We're staying at the meat and cleaver by the docks and I wouldn't recommend anywhere else

1650
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:13,920
If you value your freedom, I'll see you there

1651
03:10:14,639 --> 03:10:16,639
He winks and heads off into the crowd

1652
03:10:23,040 --> 03:10:30,100
interesting

1653
03:10:30,100 --> 03:10:39,879
Bare-knuckle fighting you cross the fairground to a wrestling ring of ruffian inside is announcing the current challenge

1654
03:10:40,920 --> 03:10:42,530
People of kai

1655
03:10:42,530 --> 03:10:44,450
Are you ready for a fight?

1656
03:10:44,450 --> 03:10:46,450
In the white corner, we have our challenger

1657
03:10:46,770 --> 03:10:48,770
anva the barbarian

1658
03:10:49,239 --> 03:10:52,159
Crowd cheers and whoops

1659
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:58,639
Look over anvar anvar is about half as tall as you again with sheets of muscle on his arms and legs

1660
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:01,200
But he's probably lighter than the ogre

1661
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:03,200
Which will mean he has less momentum

1662
03:11:04,319 --> 03:11:09,219
And in the black corner the brawling champion of kare the one they call skull splitter

1663
03:11:09,760 --> 03:11:12,000
the ogre kaga of tadu lei

1664
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:18,850
The ogre looks as thick as any ogre you might meet but he is made of solid muscle

1665
03:11:19,329 --> 03:11:21,889
His arms and legs like the twisted bark of trees

1666
03:11:23,219 --> 03:11:27,860
Challenger, are you ready demands the ruffian anvar nods and beats his chest

1667
03:11:28,579 --> 03:11:39,190
Place a bet you find a wager man by looking for his enormous hat to which odds and returns are pinned on bits of cloth

1668
03:11:39,909 --> 03:11:42,399
Feeling lucky, are you?

1669
03:11:43,440 --> 03:11:45,440
Place your money on me

1670
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:49,280
His palms are sweating and you notice he carries flick blades inside his sleeves

1671
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:51,920
Give me all your money

1672
03:11:51,920 --> 03:12:00,659
What are the odds three to one on the challenger one to three on the champion?

1673
03:12:02,709 --> 03:12:04,229
What does that mean?

1674
03:12:04,229 --> 03:12:10,149
For every coin you bet on the barbarian you get three extra back if he wins

1675
03:12:10,709 --> 03:12:15,590
But for every three coins you put on the ogre you will only get one extra back if he wins

1676
03:12:23,059 --> 03:12:29,540
All right place a bet you take your money bet on the barbarian. I bet on the barbarian

1677
03:12:30,850 --> 03:12:33,649
Maximum bet is three pieces good odds though

1678
03:12:34,370 --> 03:12:41,620
You hand over three gold pieces and the bookkeeper makes a mark on his hat with a bet

1679
03:12:42,709 --> 03:12:47,350
Meanwhile in the ring the fight has begun the barbarian in the white corner growls and beats his chest

1680
03:12:47,750 --> 03:12:54,229
The ogre raises his fist into the air and shakes them quite a lot of posturing so far, but not much actual wrestling

1681
03:13:04,709 --> 03:13:08,709
Read minds

1682
03:13:08,709 --> 03:13:10,709
Stop lock doors

1683
03:13:10,870 --> 03:13:16,600
cause slowness

1684
03:13:16,600 --> 03:13:18,120
sap

1685
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:20,840
Cause oh, yeah, I can cheat. I can cheat. I can cheat

1686
03:13:23,379 --> 03:13:25,700
I can sap the ogre and win. Yep

1687
03:13:26,340 --> 03:13:29,559
What is k?

1688
03:13:29,559 --> 03:13:31,559
create illusions

1689
03:13:31,559 --> 03:13:35,000
This might be fun. Wait, that would be cheating though. It'd be like why the fuck this guy come from

1690
03:13:35,799 --> 03:13:45,139
Let's do slowness

1691
03:13:45,139 --> 03:13:56,229
You ready the enchantment preparing to slow down one of the two combatants cast it on the ogre

1692
03:13:56,790 --> 03:14:03,479
You cast a spell over the ogre and the balance of the fight begins to change

1693
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:08,680
Suddenly the ogre looks dizzy and slow and cannot seem to grip his opponent properly

1694
03:14:09,319 --> 03:14:13,479
The barbarian beats his chest and pounds the ogre heavily about the head

1695
03:14:14,639 --> 03:14:16,639
Anvar is looking good

1696
03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:20,120
Shout for the barbarian

1697
03:14:20,120 --> 03:14:21,479
Finish him

1698
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:25,000
To the barbarian who bellows with anger

1699
03:14:26,049 --> 03:14:30,770
The slow-moving ogre roars with rage and struggles forward against the barbarian landing a mighty blow

1700
03:14:31,569 --> 03:14:33,729
Anvar's agility is helping him take the fight

1701
03:14:34,370 --> 03:14:36,930
Then the ogre puts in a devastating side swipe

1702
03:14:37,409 --> 03:14:42,049
The barbarian staggers suddenly the crowd gasps, but he picks himself up once more

1703
03:14:48,790 --> 03:14:56,440
Come on just

1704
03:14:56,440 --> 03:14:59,989
Cast depression on the ogre

1705
03:14:59,989 --> 03:15:03,129
You cast the enchantment over the ogre who begins to look thoroughly miserable

1706
03:15:04,010 --> 03:15:06,409
You have given anvar a much-needed boost

1707
03:15:07,379 --> 03:15:09,459
The ogre's lip has split and is bleeding

1708
03:15:10,280 --> 03:15:13,239
Anvar roars and thumps his opponent in the back

1709
03:15:13,799 --> 03:15:15,319
Anvar is winning

1710
03:15:15,319 --> 03:15:23,059
Should I wait cheer for the ogre?

1711
03:15:24,090 --> 03:15:31,399
Cheer for the barbarian

1712
03:15:31,399 --> 03:15:49,770
Should I cheer for the ogre now?

1713
03:15:49,770 --> 03:15:56,889
Uh, let's read the ogre's mind you read the ogre's mind, but find no particular thoughts except one

1714
03:15:57,690 --> 03:15:59,129
a sound

1715
03:15:59,129 --> 03:16:00,969
Playing over and over

1716
03:16:00,969 --> 03:16:04,090
It is the sound of an arm bone snapping in two

1717
03:16:07,059 --> 03:16:11,299
Growling and muttering the ogre works into the barbarian cracking his skull

1718
03:16:12,659 --> 03:16:14,659
Anvar is looking stronger than ever what?

1719
03:16:18,459 --> 03:16:20,459
God damn it kill him already

1720
03:16:42,729 --> 03:16:56,639
Okay illusions you ready the spell but what illusion will you cast make the ogre see the barbarian as plague-ridden

1721
03:16:57,909 --> 03:17:00,389
Make the barbarian see the ogre grow taller

1722
03:17:04,790 --> 03:17:06,809
Make the ogre see the barbarian as plague-ridden

1723
03:17:11,430 --> 03:17:15,670
You cast your spell over the ogre making the barbarian appear plague-ridden and infectious

1724
03:17:16,629 --> 03:17:18,629
Begins to hang back not wanting to engage

1725
03:17:19,190 --> 03:17:22,870
And every time anvar grabs him he begins to whimper with fear

1726
03:17:23,590 --> 03:17:26,389
The fight is going really badly for skull splitter now

1727
03:17:27,110 --> 03:17:34,149
Finally it is all over with a single throw anvar the barbarian powers forward and hurls skull splitter to the mat the crowd goes wild

1728
03:17:35,159 --> 03:17:37,159
You find the bookkeeper to collect your winnings

1729
03:17:37,899 --> 03:17:39,260
You got lucky

1730
03:17:39,260 --> 03:17:43,020
Sulk the bookkeeper he hands over 12 gold pieces. Oh, yeah

1731
03:17:43,989 --> 03:17:47,590
Inside the ring the master of the fight raises the barbarian's fist in the air

1732
03:17:48,389 --> 03:17:52,229
Who challenges our champion the prize is 10 gold pieces

1733
03:17:53,739 --> 03:17:55,100
I'll do it

1734
03:17:55,100 --> 03:17:56,780
I challenge him

1735
03:17:56,780 --> 03:17:58,309
You cry

1736
03:17:58,309 --> 03:18:00,950
All eyes turn to look at you the fight master beams

1737
03:18:01,930 --> 03:18:04,090
We have a stranger taking the challenger

1738
03:18:05,030 --> 03:18:06,229
Let him through

1739
03:18:06,229 --> 03:18:16,010
You got any food?

1740
03:18:16,010 --> 03:18:22,790
Yeah, all right. I can drink this. I don't care about healing somebody else. It's for me

1741
03:18:27,739 --> 03:18:33,899
Okay, the crowd parts and you are helped up into the ring under his breath the fight master outlines the rules

1742
03:18:34,379 --> 03:18:38,700
A fair fight no magic and pound your opponent until they can't stand

1743
03:18:39,420 --> 03:18:41,530
Ready?

1744
03:18:41,530 --> 03:18:46,569
You look over your opponent. He is almost half as tall as you again with muscles on his chest and arm

1745
03:18:47,209 --> 03:18:50,500
It's like sculpted to wax

1746
03:18:50,500 --> 03:18:55,219
In the back corner, then the ruffian announces is anvar in the white corner

1747
03:18:55,940 --> 03:18:57,940
ruffian turns to you and hisses

1748
03:18:58,340 --> 03:19:00,020
What should I call you?

1749
03:19:00,020 --> 03:19:14,299
The anilander the stranger. I don't care. Just get on with it the anilander. Oh boy. I get out. Okay

1750
03:19:19,819 --> 03:19:21,819
The anilander are you to cry?

1751
03:19:22,139 --> 03:19:26,700
Shouting it out to the crowd so they can hear they catch the name and throw it up to the sky

1752
03:19:27,260 --> 03:19:29,260
the anilander

1753
03:19:30,219 --> 03:19:36,950
They cheer the crowd begin to furiously place bets. You can hear them discussing your relative merits. He looks feeble. He looks like a maniac

1754
03:19:37,430 --> 03:19:39,319
You ready your fists

1755
03:19:39,319 --> 03:19:40,680
ball blast

1756
03:19:40,680 --> 03:19:44,120
Got him

1757
03:19:44,120 --> 03:19:46,329
Got him. Mm-hmm

1758
03:19:46,329 --> 03:19:49,049
He steps backwards across the ring putting space between you

1759
03:19:49,930 --> 03:19:53,299
That's gonna be a defense. He's gonna defend but we're gonna go like 2.5

1760
03:19:54,100 --> 03:19:58,940
Fuck you

1761
03:19:58,940 --> 03:19:59,979
All right

1762
03:19:59,979 --> 03:20:04,459
He grabs you and knees you in the midriff knocking the wind from your chest. Okay, I gotta defend here

1763
03:20:06,889 --> 03:20:08,889
Oh, come on. It's all right. I got enough power

1764
03:20:09,450 --> 03:20:15,079
I'm gonna go in full blast

1765
03:20:15,579 --> 03:20:19,319
Mmm

1766
03:20:19,319 --> 03:20:21,719
Reading a forceful blow the barbarian blocks

1767
03:20:28,139 --> 03:20:30,149
drop back defensively

1768
03:20:30,149 --> 03:20:35,590
Knocking you back. Okay, so he used his whole bar. We're gonna go like four. I could actually he might be able to do more

1769
03:20:36,389 --> 03:20:37,909
Yep, thank god

1770
03:20:37,909 --> 03:20:39,030
We're good

1771
03:20:39,030 --> 03:20:45,690
A gasp goes up from the crowd. We're going full blast again 6.4. Get him

1772
03:20:46,569 --> 03:20:48,870
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. All right. All right, I'll win

1773
03:20:49,510 --> 03:20:54,090
The barbarian drops into a defensive crouch

1774
03:21:02,709 --> 03:21:07,510
The barbarian is holding back someone in the crowd is shouting advice body blow time

1775
03:21:08,149 --> 03:21:17,030
There it is. Got him. What?

1776
03:21:17,190 --> 03:21:25,340
How is that only one?

1777
03:21:25,340 --> 03:21:29,899
Shaking his stupid head. He picks himself through his feet once more. He moves away towards the other corner

1778
03:21:30,540 --> 03:21:33,030
Can I get him here? Can I catch him?

1779
03:21:33,190 --> 03:21:40,139
I caught him you lunge forward again writing a forceful swing you hurdle forward

1780
03:21:40,620 --> 03:21:44,139
Anvar staggers back gasping his face a mess of blood and bruises

1781
03:21:45,319 --> 03:21:47,319
Summoning the last ounce of strength in your arms

1782
03:21:47,639 --> 03:21:53,799
You ready a final knock back knockout punch that sends him back across the mat and out of the ring

1783
03:21:54,440 --> 03:21:57,129
Look at this fucking cash. I'm building up here

1784
03:21:58,149 --> 03:22:01,350
You stagger from the ring the crowd cheering for you and collect your winnings

1785
03:22:02,379 --> 03:22:09,209
I got 33 gold now

1786
03:22:09,209 --> 03:22:16,889
All right, the end of the fair

1787
03:22:16,889 --> 03:22:19,290
You push your way through the crowd following the road uphill

1788
03:22:19,770 --> 03:22:24,649
The party is getting wilder and you would do well to be away from here before things get out of hand

1789
03:22:25,639 --> 03:22:29,559
At the far edge of the fair the litter has left a tide mark on the grass

1790
03:22:30,520 --> 03:22:35,879
There's one last small tent here probably a ticket booth that has simply been ignored by the crowds of kare

1791
03:22:39,350 --> 03:22:41,829
Looking back you see what looks like one of the tents going up in flames

1792
03:22:42,389 --> 03:22:45,030
It must be part of the entertainment as no one seems too concerned

1793
03:22:45,590 --> 03:22:50,870
In fact a great cheer goes up as one of the strings of flags collapses into the bonfire

1794
03:22:53,979 --> 03:22:57,659
Ahead the road continues through empty fields and patches of rubble strewn wasteland

1795
03:22:58,219 --> 03:23:01,180
But it climbs so it must be heading for the center of kare

1796
03:23:01,750 --> 03:23:08,059
Steam rises from a large building beside a fork in the road you pause to walk around the small tent

1797
03:23:08,379 --> 03:23:14,100
To discover it is in fact a small attraction of its own a sign above the door reads cabinet of fortune

1798
03:23:14,579 --> 03:23:16,659
Try your luck a prize for all

1799
03:23:17,719 --> 03:23:19,739
You have time to test your luck

1800
03:23:19,739 --> 03:23:26,700
No doubt if you wanted

1801
03:23:26,700 --> 03:23:30,940
Uh, we're gonna go in here

1802
03:23:30,940 --> 03:23:33,500
You go over to the tent and push back the flap inside

1803
03:23:33,899 --> 03:23:39,579
A grubby bearded man leaps up from where he was sitting cross-legged on the floor and comes over to pump your hand

1804
03:23:42,569 --> 03:23:44,629
Welcome welcome my friend

1805
03:23:44,629 --> 03:23:46,629
And let's see what prize you can win today

1806
03:23:47,030 --> 03:23:51,350
You must know this there are no losers at honest hannah's cabinet of fortune

1807
03:23:52,340 --> 03:24:02,059
He gestures with one hand towards a large glass cabinet in the center of the tent interesting

1808
03:24:04,620 --> 03:24:07,500
Uh, what do I do? How much does it cost look inside the cabinet?

1809
03:24:07,899 --> 03:24:10,780
You step forward and peer in through the glass

1810
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:17,340
Inside there are piles of jewelry books gold and other things as well as a small wiry creature

1811
03:24:17,979 --> 03:24:22,729
Curled up fast asleep. What is that creature?

1812
03:24:23,860 --> 03:24:25,219
My little pet

1813
03:24:25,219 --> 03:24:30,180
He's perfectly harmless. Oh, well, he bites but only when you open the cabinet to feed him

1814
03:24:32,020 --> 03:24:34,020
Uh, what do I do?

1815
03:24:34,469 --> 03:24:36,389
It's a most simple game

1816
03:24:36,389 --> 03:24:43,860
You give me two gold pieces and then my little pet will fetch something for you. Fuck up

1817
03:24:44,760 --> 03:24:46,760
The fuck up the fuck up

1818
03:24:53,059 --> 03:24:57,030
resurrect the dead

1819
03:24:57,030 --> 03:24:59,030
rap talk all languages

1820
03:25:03,290 --> 03:25:10,790
Talk all languages

1821
03:25:10,790 --> 03:25:11,989
tell

1822
03:25:11,989 --> 03:25:17,639
Read minds

1823
03:25:17,639 --> 03:25:21,159
Uh sus, obviously

1824
03:25:21,239 --> 03:25:26,280
uh magic protection

1825
03:25:26,280 --> 03:25:27,719
I'm gonna i'm gonna talk

1826
03:25:27,719 --> 03:25:40,629
I'm gonna do a rap you put on the wig and cast your spell not on hannah. Of course, you can understand everything he says

1827
03:25:41,270 --> 03:25:43,270
What about the creature in the glass cabinet?

1828
03:25:43,430 --> 03:25:46,309
Sadly though it is not speaking it sits in glum

1829
03:25:47,190 --> 03:25:49,399
thoughtful silence

1830
03:25:49,399 --> 03:26:03,510
shit

1831
03:26:03,510 --> 03:26:05,819
Here you pay two gold pieces

1832
03:26:06,459 --> 03:26:12,649
And hannah goes over to the cabinet and presses a small button on the side. It seems to operate a hold on

1833
03:26:13,290 --> 03:26:20,629
It's sneezed. I have to sneeze again

1834
03:26:20,629 --> 03:26:22,860
seems to operate a

1835
03:26:22,860 --> 03:26:24,620
canted levered spike

1836
03:26:24,620 --> 03:26:29,579
Which pokes the creature who squeals jumps from its perch and begins fluttering around inside the cave

1837
03:26:31,909 --> 03:26:34,309
What now?

1838
03:26:34,309 --> 03:26:39,510
You can try to influence its choice by shouting at it the angrier you can make it the better for the prize

1839
03:26:40,069 --> 03:26:42,340
Usually i'm not sure why

1840
03:26:42,340 --> 03:26:48,659
As if to make the point the creature picks up a ruby ring and smiles and drops it and flies up to the top

1841
03:26:48,659 --> 03:26:55,639
of the tank

1842
03:26:55,639 --> 03:26:57,500
Shout something

1843
03:26:57,500 --> 03:26:59,500
Although it does not seem very fair

1844
03:26:59,500 --> 03:27:04,299
You determine to infuriate you you determine to infuriate the creature as much as possible

1845
03:27:05,479 --> 03:27:07,479
Stupid creature freedom lorag

1846
03:27:08,299 --> 03:27:26,170
Kari lorag freedom freedom the creature in the tank flaps around gently. What else could you try?

1847
03:27:26,569 --> 03:27:29,899
I mean hannah obviously like right

1848
03:27:33,190 --> 03:27:34,069
hannah

1849
03:27:34,069 --> 03:27:36,379
The strange might is still flying around with glowing eyes

1850
03:27:36,620 --> 03:27:39,750
There must be something that will get this creature to see truly you see red

1851
03:27:43,430 --> 03:27:47,229
Lorag the flying thing circles around furiously

1852
03:27:47,709 --> 03:27:52,840
Eventually the creature selects something from the prize pool which it drops into a chute at the far end of the cabinet

1853
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:02,110
I take what if I just leave it will that do something?

1854
03:28:02,750 --> 03:28:07,049
What is it?

1855
03:28:07,049 --> 03:28:09,340
a giant's tooth

1856
03:28:09,340 --> 03:28:11,180
a good prize

1857
03:28:11,180 --> 03:28:14,139
You nod to hannah who grimaces as you head back out of the tent

1858
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:28,120
All right, we got us we got another tooth. I wonder how that could probably go a few different ways cool

1859
03:28:28,680 --> 03:28:34,489
Okay. All right, so we can all we can either go

1860
03:28:35,129 --> 03:28:38,520
Yeah, we can go out now

1861
03:28:38,520 --> 03:28:41,020
So we're trying to get

1862
03:28:41,100 --> 03:28:42,059
here

1863
03:28:42,059 --> 03:28:47,309
This area here get that in mind

1864
03:28:51,049 --> 03:28:57,840
You're back by the bath house on the edge of the fair. All right, so we can go in the bath house

1865
03:28:58,399 --> 03:29:02,459
Well, we can go uphill. We need to eventually go uphill. So we're going to bath house

1866
03:29:02,780 --> 03:29:11,370
Let's do the bath house. You step in the cool of the bath house

1867
03:29:12,079 --> 03:29:15,920
It is a wide building of marbled tiles and a sweet smell of pine and fresh wood

1868
03:29:16,680 --> 03:29:24,250
Gentle noises echo and murmur around the walls a creature by the front desk greets you with a smile. Good afternoon

1869
03:29:26,459 --> 03:29:29,559
The water is cool and fresh today

1870
03:29:31,180 --> 03:29:49,629
My swim costs four gold pieces. I need it. Is it worth it? Oh very the creature replies

1871
03:29:52,440 --> 03:29:56,120
The waters of cara are known for their healing and refreshing qualities

1872
03:29:56,440 --> 03:30:03,739
We have a steam room in a lagoon pool. You'll be well catered for sure

1873
03:30:04,139 --> 03:30:09,610
You enter before gold pieces and the concierge gestures you through into the center of the bath house

1874
03:30:09,850 --> 03:30:16,059
Where a wide pool awaits with trees and shrubs on either side the pool

1875
03:30:18,559 --> 03:30:22,079
From across the room steam curls from the doorway of a glass doored room

1876
03:30:22,829 --> 03:30:26,909
You strip off and pile your clothes and belongings in the corner of the room

1877
03:30:28,860 --> 03:30:30,920
I'm going to the steam room

1878
03:30:30,920 --> 03:30:36,920
You enter the steam room and take a seat on one of the benches. The temperature is almost unbearable through the curling smoke

1879
03:30:36,920 --> 03:30:40,379
You see another figure in the shadows. You are not alone

1880
03:30:44,239 --> 03:30:47,979
Hey, what's up? Hey, how you doing? What's up, dude?

1881
03:30:56,719 --> 03:31:06,799
I would that would never happen. I would never do this. Hey, what's up? Hey, you need a spotter

1882
03:31:08,159 --> 03:31:12,250
It's a steam room, dude

1883
03:31:12,250 --> 03:31:13,450
Greetings

1884
03:31:13,450 --> 03:31:15,239
You call through the smoke

1885
03:31:15,239 --> 03:31:19,079
The other figure does not reply but stands and moves away through the steam

1886
03:31:19,709 --> 03:31:23,170
You feel the blast of cold air as the door opens and then closes

1887
03:31:28,879 --> 03:31:31,680
I'm sorry if i'm in the steam room and I hear somebody from across

1888
03:31:31,680 --> 03:31:36,649
I'm sitting on the other side of the bench say greetings and be like, yeah, i'm getting the fuck out of here

1889
03:31:37,770 --> 03:31:43,790
I'm gonna go somewhere else you sit in the smoke enjoying the relaxing steam until you cannot take the heat anymore

1890
03:31:44,799 --> 03:31:46,840
Wait a little longer

1891
03:31:46,840 --> 03:31:52,280
You wait a little longer as the steam sinks deep into your bones and makes your muscles relax

1892
03:31:52,920 --> 03:31:59,790
You feel quite wonderful for it a second figure who you would not notice before stands and leaves the steam room

1893
03:32:01,440 --> 03:32:05,520
You head back out of the steam room. You feel your shoulders unknotting and your body relaxing

1894
03:32:06,969 --> 03:32:11,690
You dive into the pool and swim a few enjoyable lengths. You feel better for the exercise

1895
03:32:12,010 --> 03:32:20,280
You feel a great calm and relaxedness flooding through your veins feeling much better. You turn and collect your belongings

1896
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:27,399
Yeah, check them over not trusting the city to pass up the chance to rob you you check through your belongings

1897
03:32:28,090 --> 03:32:30,090
But everything seems to still be in in place

1898
03:32:30,569 --> 03:32:36,120
Pleased you head for the exit the creature at the front desk beams cheerfully at you you step outside onto the street

1899
03:32:36,200 --> 03:32:38,639
We just that's there it is good rest

1900
03:32:42,809 --> 03:32:43,049
All right

1901
03:32:43,049 --> 03:32:53,659
We're gonna go up uphill the road twists and turns up the rise until you emerge into a wider road on the edge

1902
03:32:53,739 --> 03:32:57,450
Of the dense slum from inside down a street to the left

1903
03:32:57,770 --> 03:33:02,799
You can hear the very faint sound of singing a smell of rotting fish begins to fill the air

1904
03:33:03,290 --> 03:33:07,559
You must be close to the docks

1905
03:33:07,559 --> 03:33:07,799
All right

1906
03:33:07,799 --> 03:33:13,840
So where is this place between the well and the docks is it this way or is it this way?

1907
03:33:14,079 --> 03:33:21,239
Is it the docks or is it near the well?

1908
03:33:21,639 --> 03:33:31,120
I'm gonna imagine we can we can go this way and hopefully we can go from here to there

1909
03:33:31,360 --> 03:33:39,559
Let's go to the well winding between tall

1910
03:33:40,260 --> 03:33:44,760
crazily built slum dwellings the road you are now on leads through the dense lower city

1911
03:33:45,479 --> 03:33:50,200
The street is narrow and you keep your head held high in case someone should try their luck with a blade

1912
03:33:51,129 --> 03:33:58,329
After a few minutes of edging floors you emerge into a wider space a flag-stoned plaza at the center of it is a circular well mouth

1913
03:33:58,909 --> 03:34:00,909
alleyways lead off in four directions

1914
03:34:02,459 --> 03:34:04,459
You pause to look around the edge of the square

1915
03:34:04,780 --> 03:34:10,620
The alleyways all look the same except that to the left the lane heads downwards turning away from the center of kare

1916
03:34:12,250 --> 03:34:17,610
The only thing the alleys have in common is that they converge here once presumably this well served all the people in the district

1917
03:34:18,090 --> 03:34:22,010
But perhaps there were too many people because now the well seems dusty and dry

1918
03:34:23,840 --> 03:34:27,370
Look down the well

1919
03:34:27,370 --> 03:34:30,090
Leaning over the edge you peer down into the depths of the well strange

1920
03:34:30,090 --> 03:34:34,489
This well seems to have handholds cut into its stones. They appear good enough to climb down

1921
03:34:35,049 --> 03:34:43,870
Uh, we're not going down here. We're gonna choose the road. Here we go. All right, so we need to this is where we need to go

1922
03:34:44,430 --> 03:34:50,399
This is where we need to be

1923
03:34:50,399 --> 03:34:52,399
This direction between the well and the docks

1924
03:34:54,120 --> 03:35:01,000
This street is a little wider and more well paved than some of the others. You can see tracks where carts have come this way

1925
03:35:01,799 --> 03:35:03,799
You hear the sound of voices around a corner

1926
03:35:06,120 --> 03:35:08,319
Walk on

1927
03:35:08,319 --> 03:35:10,319
You walk around the corner intrigued by the sound

1928
03:35:11,309 --> 03:35:15,069
There is a small crowd of people talking and singing inside a low stone shrine

1929
03:35:15,870 --> 03:35:20,829
Beyond you can see the sparkle of the river and the smell of rotting fish. You're nearly at the docks

1930
03:35:21,309 --> 03:35:26,190
There's the shrine. All right, let's go. Let's get that out of the line

1931
03:35:26,829 --> 03:35:32,729
You step into the doorway of the shrine at the same time as a woman and her child are leaving

1932
03:35:34,030 --> 03:35:37,149
He really is a holy man mother the little one is saying

1933
03:35:37,799 --> 03:35:49,040
Lassen's lame brother answered his question and he ran off the stage the mother nods and the pair leave interesting step inside

1934
03:35:51,399 --> 03:35:53,399
The shrine is an old stone building

1935
03:35:54,020 --> 03:35:57,000
garishly decorated with hanging cloths and thick candles

1936
03:35:58,299 --> 03:36:04,680
That fill the air with the smell of grease and tar at the far end on a low platform stands a hooded figure in a white robe

1937
03:36:05,180 --> 03:36:12,969
Who was talking to the assembled crowd? Oh, this is the cerise. This is okay. Yep. I remember this remember this

1938
03:36:12,969 --> 03:36:23,520
We saw maybe we've read our own fortune. This is we did this already remember it was a guy in the white robe

1939
03:36:23,920 --> 03:36:28,399
Does anyone else wish to test?

1940
03:36:28,479 --> 03:36:36,600
Let me do that again. Does anyone else wish to take the test of slang god of malice?

1941
03:36:36,920 --> 03:36:48,409
Reese calls out a murmur goes around the crowd people are nervous but excited examine the crowd crowd is a mixture of young and

1942
03:36:48,409 --> 03:36:52,440
old women and men some cheer and joke and murmur while other

1943
03:36:53,709 --> 03:36:58,190
Have their legs and arms folded in a devout pose and pray through silent lips

1944
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:07,579
How many are spectators and how many are followers of slang you cannot tell anyone who can answer the question will be granted their wish

1945
03:37:08,139 --> 03:37:15,049
The priest continues wait and watch you wait and watch suddenly a man leaps to his feet

1946
03:37:15,680 --> 03:37:20,819
I'll do it. He declares the rest of the group cheers and the man a geriatric

1947
03:37:21,520 --> 03:37:26,319
Is helped up onto the platform. Are you a follower of slang?

1948
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:36,170
The man spits very well in one corner of the room a gong is sounded and the crowd falls silent

1949
03:37:39,549 --> 03:37:43,600
Which do you choose the priest demands of the man?

1950
03:37:44,729 --> 03:37:50,840
Will you take the impossible challenge or pay the price of the easy challenge?

1951
03:37:51,159 --> 03:37:57,229
The man looks uncertain and turns to the audience people begin to shout suggestions

1952
03:37:59,209 --> 03:38:08,600
Choose the impossible choose the easy one choose the impossible you cry out adding your voice to those around you

1953
03:38:09,100 --> 03:38:16,110
Bellowing loud and confidently after a few minutes the priest quiets the room and turns back to the man

1954
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:26,430
So what do you choose i'll take the impossible challenge the man grins very well very well

1955
03:38:27,149 --> 03:38:30,969
There is no price for the impossible challenge. Are you ready?

1956
03:38:33,610 --> 03:38:42,430
Wait and listen then tell me what is the answer to the question that is never asked

1957
03:38:42,750 --> 03:38:48,200
The man falls silent for a moment chewing his lower lip and musing over his answer

1958
03:38:49,899 --> 03:38:52,780
Um

1959
03:38:52,940 --> 03:39:02,200
Silence the priest smiles sadly and shakes his head a clever answer but not correct. Oh

1960
03:39:03,559 --> 03:39:07,530
The crowd sigh in disappointment a man at your elbow remarks

1961
03:39:08,750 --> 03:39:10,829
People always try the impossible challenge

1962
03:39:10,829 --> 03:39:15,819
You'd think they'd get the hint the man leaves the platform and the priest turns back to the crowd

1963
03:39:16,959 --> 03:39:25,520
Who will be next as he waits for an answer the priest plucks a knife from his belt and casually stabs it into his own hand

1964
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:35,559
I'll take the challenge because we know the answer. I will take your challenge a stranger

1965
03:39:36,520 --> 03:39:48,299
Welcome him, please. Welcome. Welcome him. The crowd whisper and murmur as you make your way to the platform

1966
03:39:49,389 --> 03:39:55,920
Welcome stranger. Are you ready to take the challenge knowing folwell that very few succeed

1967
03:39:58,159 --> 03:39:59,280
I am

1968
03:39:59,280 --> 03:40:02,860
the crowd cheer

1969
03:40:02,860 --> 03:40:05,770
Your response

1970
03:40:05,770 --> 03:40:10,459
Then know this flying is not a punishing god, but he is malicious

1971
03:40:11,340 --> 03:40:13,340
He does not wish for you to fail

1972
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:15,760
But should you fail?

1973
03:40:15,760 --> 03:40:19,360
He wishes you to know that it was all your own fault

1974
03:40:21,760 --> 03:40:22,719
Mm-hmm

1975
03:40:22,719 --> 03:40:24,559
The priest continues

1976
03:40:24,559 --> 03:40:31,440
Our practice is that you may choose which question to answer but know this one is impossible and the other is easy

1977
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:35,760
And to answer the easy question you must give up something you hold most dear

1978
03:40:36,799 --> 03:40:40,479
The crowd are watching in it and expect in silence. It's time for you to choose

1979
03:40:40,959 --> 03:40:54,270
Make sure I get this right

1980
03:40:54,270 --> 03:40:59,020
What was it?

1981
03:40:59,020 --> 03:41:04,239
The answer to the question in the vision you saw the answer to the question that has never been asked sirisi

1982
03:41:04,799 --> 03:41:11,899
Okay, that's making sure I get it, right

1983
03:41:12,670 --> 03:41:14,670
I choose the impossible question

1984
03:41:17,549 --> 03:41:21,389
The crowd wait expectantly and the priest closes his eyes and intones

1985
03:41:22,489 --> 03:41:25,450
What is the answer to the question that has never been asked?

1986
03:41:26,459 --> 03:41:31,719
Your heart leaps your vision is coming to pass. I don't know

1987
03:41:32,680 --> 03:41:35,389
sirisi

1988
03:41:35,389 --> 03:41:36,829
There is a moment

1989
03:41:36,829 --> 03:41:37,950
pause

1990
03:41:37,950 --> 03:41:40,350
As the priest screws up his eyes

1991
03:41:40,989 --> 03:41:50,139
The priest nods once slowly that is correct. The question has never been answered

1992
03:41:50,860 --> 03:41:56,139
In the three thousand years since this site was first made wholly to slang

1993
03:41:57,319 --> 03:42:03,319
The answer has been passed on from one priest to the next I never thought I would be the one to hear it spoken

1994
03:42:03,879 --> 03:42:06,040
Because I do not understand it

1995
03:42:06,040 --> 03:42:13,180
And I do not know the question he turns to you and bows his head once you are truly blessed

1996
03:42:13,979 --> 03:42:16,479
Please what is your wish?

1997
03:42:18,090 --> 03:42:22,409
I wish to be rich beyond my imagination. Tell me the spell for the north gate

1998
03:42:22,809 --> 03:42:27,209
Tell me the order of the spell can kare be saved. I wish to be stronger than anyone ever

1999
03:42:28,670 --> 03:42:30,989
That's like a toddler the thing to say

2000
03:42:31,709 --> 03:42:36,350
I wish to be stronger than anyone ever even superman even god stronger than god answer man

2001
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:42,620
um

2002
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:49,340
It's the spell right because this is where one of the lines is from tell me the spell for the north gate

2003
03:42:56,479 --> 03:42:58,479
Tell me the spell for the north gate

2004
03:42:58,479 --> 03:43:01,610
The priest closes his eyes and summons his god

2005
03:43:04,030 --> 03:43:06,430
I cannot tell you the spell in its entirety

2006
03:43:07,069 --> 03:43:10,879
But mulaz the second noble was a follower of slang

2007
03:43:11,440 --> 03:43:14,719
And the line he knew was I bid you portals

2008
03:43:15,440 --> 03:43:16,639
wide

2009
03:43:16,639 --> 03:43:21,879
open

2010
03:43:21,879 --> 03:43:28,459
Got it. You thank him the crowd reach out to touch your tunic as you make your way to the door

2011
03:43:29,280 --> 03:43:34,409
Clearly not many survived the challenge of slang back on the street at his night time to find somewhere to rest

2012
03:43:38,940 --> 03:43:40,940
I said I said I said it wrong

2013
03:43:41,420 --> 03:43:48,139
This priest has the only opportunity in his entire lifetime to hear this it's been thousands of years

2014
03:43:48,620 --> 03:43:52,139
And he screws up the sentence. He must be like fuck

2015
03:43:52,700 --> 03:43:55,659
Oh, how could I do that? I gotta be so stupid

2016
03:43:56,459 --> 03:44:02,840
You needed the order. Well, I didn't have I I didn't have the line

2017
03:44:03,739 --> 03:44:10,750
This is where I could get the line

2018
03:44:10,750 --> 03:44:20,030
Yeah, the order is I don't I need the the the lines first. Yeah, I can still get it

2019
03:44:23,290 --> 03:44:26,969
I think I don't I already have the order. Wasn't it scratched on something? Hold on

2020
03:44:27,610 --> 03:44:33,399
Remember wasn't I like I I swear see here it is right there

2021
03:44:37,290 --> 03:44:38,250
No

2022
03:44:38,250 --> 03:44:41,530
Something corgis grace one lock. Wait, is this it?

2023
03:44:45,690 --> 03:44:57,040
That's that's it. Isn't it?

2024
03:44:57,040 --> 03:44:59,920
Tumblers to yep, that's that's it. We got the we already have the order

2025
03:45:01,920 --> 03:45:03,920
One lock made of golems hide

2026
03:45:05,920 --> 03:45:07,920
Tumblers to seal deep inside

2027
03:45:08,680 --> 03:45:10,680
I bid you portals open wide

2028
03:45:13,469 --> 03:45:16,190
For my legs to walk in here and fucking stride

2029
03:45:16,670 --> 03:45:20,809
We just need the last line

2030
03:45:20,809 --> 03:45:22,809
Which is down here

2031
03:45:23,049 --> 03:45:36,829
Okay, let's uh head to the docks. What's the the clue for this one?

2032
03:45:37,469 --> 03:45:47,920
Okay, seventh noble theta is a beggar

2033
03:45:49,520 --> 03:45:51,120
blind beggar

2034
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:57,690
Can be found blind and begging in the ruins of the fallen quarter of the city

2035
03:46:02,030 --> 03:46:03,610
so

2036
03:46:03,610 --> 03:46:05,290
He's down here

2037
03:46:05,290 --> 03:46:08,750
So we're gonna figure out a way to get down there

2038
03:46:12,000 --> 03:46:12,879
Okay

2039
03:46:12,879 --> 03:46:14,479
Uh, let's have it the docks

2040
03:46:14,479 --> 03:46:21,389
The smell of rotting fish and mucky water fills your nostrils. You know this area well

2041
03:46:22,090 --> 03:46:25,049
You've reached the docks once more the beating heart of care

2042
03:46:25,530 --> 03:46:28,860
There are two or three ships moored for the night

2043
03:46:29,100 --> 03:46:33,760
And the space between them and the road is filled with a large huge number of stalls and little shops

2044
03:46:34,159 --> 03:46:38,719
Selling everything from fishing tackle to sailing blocks to barrels of woodlouse rum

2045
03:46:39,040 --> 03:46:44,299
This must be a thriving marketplace during the day with night approaching. It is a maze of booths and cloth

2046
03:46:44,860 --> 03:46:49,579
A single bridge crosses the river here operated with ropes. He'll let the tall ships through

2047
03:46:50,079 --> 03:46:53,379
Right now the bridge is up to allow ships to sail through undisturbed

2048
03:46:54,909 --> 03:46:58,639
There are two inns visible from here the wayfarer's rest

2049
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:03,440
And the meat and cleaver the second is the one jira the musician recommended

2050
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:09,129
Well, wait a minute

2051

Do we give a shit about flank? All right. This is that you guys have to

2055
03:47:26,170 --> 03:47:28,809

03:49:56,250 --> 03:49:58,889
Okay, but what about our band of merry men?

2061
03:50:01,469 --> 03:50:05,149
What if they have a bunch of cool stuff or they have items and what if it's like what if it's like five people?

2062
03:50:05,309 --> 03:50:07,799
They all hang out with us

2063
03:50:07,799 --> 03:50:10,040
All right wayfarer's rest. Let's go

2064
03:50:15,180 --> 03:50:19,100
You make your way inside the wayfarer's rest. It's a lively and bustling place

2065
03:50:24,840 --> 03:50:29,979
Jesus

2066
03:50:29,979 --> 03:50:36,319
The innkeeper behind the bar is trying to serve numerous creatures all demanding ale at the same time while around the tables

2067
03:50:36,799 --> 03:50:41,360
Salty types and buxom wenches are laughing together and singing shanties

2068
03:50:41,920 --> 03:50:47,920
the table with the bar

2069
03:50:51,690 --> 03:50:58,569
Um flanker flanker flanker. I don't i gotta meet flanker here. I'm meeting flanker here

2070
03:50:59,129 --> 03:51:03,079
Let's go to the bar. I got money

2071
03:51:05,180 --> 03:51:10,459
You fight your way through the creatures to the bar with a thump on the bar top you catch the innkeeper's attention

2072
03:51:12,190 --> 03:51:13,469
greetings

2073
03:51:13,469 --> 03:51:15,069
Nice place you have here

2074
03:51:15,069 --> 03:51:20,190
The innkeeper nods at you. He's clearly impressed by your dress and well-educated tone

2075
03:51:21,370 --> 03:51:30,799
And what would be your purpose in these air parts? I do need food. Uh, I need food

2076
03:51:31,719 --> 03:51:33,719
Can you feed me in this hell hole?

2077
03:51:34,350 --> 03:51:36,350
The innkeeper nods. Hi

2078
03:51:36,829 --> 03:51:40,030
Uh the gills or six gold pieces hearty as you like

2079
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:43,760
The other creatures at the bar jostle and push each other for space

2080
03:51:45,610 --> 03:51:46,489
um

2081
03:51:46,489 --> 03:51:54,079
That's that's expensive. I need it though

2082
03:51:55,000 --> 03:51:57,079
You hand over six gold pieces the innkeeper nods

2083
03:51:57,639 --> 03:51:59,719
Get yourself a table and we'll bring it out when it's ready

2084
03:52:00,200 --> 03:52:07,440
Okay, what about your ale the innkeeper holds up one finger

2085
03:52:08,159 --> 03:52:13,840
A ruffian knocks over a dwarf's mug of ale the fight that breaks out is short sharp and ends with the heel of an axe

2086
03:52:13,920 --> 03:52:19,200
Breaking the ruffian's nose a great cheer goes up and the innkeeper replaces the ale

2087
03:52:19,840 --> 03:52:23,159
free of charge

2088
03:52:23,239 --> 03:52:31,360
Uh, i'll take some ale i'll have a mug then you declare you lay down a coin and the innkeeper passes you a flagon

2089
03:52:33,290 --> 03:52:37,959
What about a room? How much is a room?

2090
03:52:38,360 --> 03:52:41,639
The innkeeper holds up four fingers rather than shouting across the bar

2091
03:52:43,180 --> 03:52:46,159
Uh, i'm gonna drink my ale

2092
03:52:46,159 --> 03:52:50,399
You knock tankers with the creatures on either side of you then drain the beer in one swoop

2093
03:52:51,040 --> 03:52:55,520
It is a nutty pleasant beer fills your stomach with a pleasing warm glow

2094
03:52:56,840 --> 03:52:58,840
Anytime I read about

2095
03:52:59,899 --> 03:53:01,500
You guys get like this too

2096
03:53:01,500 --> 03:53:02,940
when I read

2097
03:53:02,940 --> 03:53:04,940
about people drinking beer

2098
03:53:05,500 --> 03:53:09,260
In fantasy novels, I want a beer right now

2099
03:53:09,920 --> 03:53:11,930
right

2100
03:53:11,930 --> 03:53:18,190
I don't really like beer. I'm not a big beer guy, but I just think of this frothy freezing cold mug

2101
03:53:19,069 --> 03:53:23,469
That's got this stout in it. I just want one

2102
03:53:23,950 --> 03:53:31,690
They describe beer so insanely and so deliciously in all these fantasy novels. Oh a flagon of ale

2103
03:53:37,370 --> 03:53:41,600
I don't know

2104
03:53:42,379 --> 03:53:47,739
They describe it like a nice root beer. Yeah replace that with a with a soda right or a root beer

2105
03:53:48,379 --> 03:53:52,459
A nice frothy foamy root beer. Oh, it's so good

2106
03:53:56,440 --> 03:53:58,280
Okay

2107
03:53:58,280 --> 03:54:00,840
Uh, let's take let's take another one. Come on. I got money

2108
03:54:04,559 --> 03:54:05,920
Oh, I didn't read this

2109
03:54:05,920 --> 03:54:09,760
But you knock tankers the creature on either side of you then drain the beer in one swoop is a nutty and pleasant

2110
03:54:09,760 --> 03:54:11,760
It fills your stomach with a pleasing warm glow

2111
03:54:12,760 --> 03:54:14,120
finest and curry

2112
03:54:14,120 --> 03:54:16,840
The innkeeper remarks seeing your satisfied smile

2113
03:54:17,559 --> 03:54:22,840
Ain't nothing that beats a good glass of wayfarers ripe. You should have another two seconds always better

2114
03:54:24,670 --> 03:54:26,840
Yeah, i'm taking another one. Let's go

2115
03:54:26,840 --> 03:54:31,000
You knock back your second mug of fine ale and feel yourself ruddy with good health

2116
03:54:31,639 --> 03:54:36,040
This inn is a charming place really and the people here are very friendly

2117
03:54:36,600 --> 03:54:39,469
The innkeeper nods with approval

2118
03:54:39,469 --> 03:54:41,790
All the best can put it away he remarks

2119
03:54:42,600 --> 03:54:52,190
Another one you buy some more beer you sweep back a third mug of ale. The effect is immediate

2120
03:54:52,670 --> 03:54:55,549
First your eyes start to fizz then your head starts to ache

2121
03:54:56,190 --> 03:54:58,750
You half get to your feet, but you can barely work out which way is up

2122
03:54:59,389 --> 03:55:01,870
Three blurry men approach you and take you by the arm

2123
03:55:03,559 --> 03:55:06,040
You're all right. Let me help you with that

2124
03:55:07,180 --> 03:55:11,180
Something moves and you feel a hard blow on your head about three seconds later

2125
03:55:11,180 --> 03:55:13,739
You realize you've been knocked unconscious as everything goes black

2126
03:55:25,370 --> 03:55:26,250
What?

2127
03:55:26,250 --> 03:55:34,590
What about flick flanker your eyes open your head is thundering and it feels ready to split

2128
03:55:38,540 --> 03:55:47,719
Where's flanker?

2129
03:55:47,719 --> 03:55:50,600
We drank two beers. What was what's going on?

2130
03:55:54,040 --> 03:55:57,069
Do we get to rewind?

2131
03:55:57,069 --> 03:56:00,430
This is a chat decision not mine. It's got to be at least 75 percent by the way

2132
03:56:02,889 --> 03:56:04,889
One rewind yes or no

2133
03:56:06,030 --> 03:56:17,149
It's got to be 75 percent. Yes, or it's not happening. This is the only that's it

2134
03:56:23,819 --> 03:56:25,319
It's got to get to

2135
03:56:25,319 --> 03:56:31,260
75 percent

2136
03:56:31,260 --> 03:56:33,260
Are we rewinding? Yes or no?

2137
03:56:33,420 --> 03:56:50,030
It says a pole is already active, but I can't see it. You guys see a pole. It says one's already there

2138
03:56:52,510 --> 03:57:03,770
Where is it? Yeah, it says a pole is active. Oh

2139
03:57:05,840 --> 03:57:25,389
Uh, let me see if I can I think it's stuck. Yeah, it says a pole is already active. It's stuck

2140
03:57:25,950 --> 03:57:36,889
You had to refresh for the pole. I'll try refreshing it. I have to refresh chat. All right. Hold on. Let me refresh chat real quick

2141
03:57:46,329 --> 03:58:08,409
Uh-huh refresh did that work? I can't see it. Wait. Oh you guys are lying. Um, I can see it now

2142
03:58:08,409 --> 03:58:21,229
All right. So what was that? It was 80 percent 79 percent. All right

All right, buy another one. This one's delicious, too

2148
03:59:02,719 --> 03:59:05,079
All right. Goodbye

2149
03:59:05,079 --> 03:59:08,200
You push your way back out of the crowd at the bar your eyes roam around the busy room

2150
03:59:08,600 --> 03:59:11,959
And the light on a shadowy figure in the corner. It's flanker

2151
03:59:13,290 --> 03:59:15,290
Blankers table. Okay, let's go

2152
03:59:18,719 --> 03:59:25,559
You go over and sit by the assassin. There you are. He declares with pleasure. He seems more relaxed than earlier

2153
03:59:26,040 --> 03:59:28,440
Perhaps he has completed whatever mission he was here to perform

2154
03:59:29,079 --> 03:59:30,969
But tell me friend

2155
03:59:30,969 --> 03:59:34,309
Do you play dice?

2156
03:59:34,309 --> 03:59:36,280
swindle stones

2157
03:59:36,280 --> 03:59:40,170
Ah, I see, you know it from a hidden pouch in his tunic

2158
03:59:40,250 --> 03:59:43,530
He pulls a set of dice out and pushes half of them across the table to you

2159
03:59:44,170 --> 03:59:46,059
Sure

2160
03:59:46,059 --> 03:59:47,340
You take them

2161
03:59:47,340 --> 03:59:50,030
Uh, what's the steak?

2162
03:59:51,440 --> 03:59:53,760
Let me propose a modest wager

2163
03:59:54,760 --> 03:59:55,959
If you win

2164
03:59:55,959 --> 03:59:57,959
I will help you with your quest

2165
03:59:58,520 --> 04:00:00,120
But if I win

2166
04:00:00,120 --> 04:00:03,639
My obligation to you is at an end and should we meet again?

2167
04:00:04,280 --> 04:00:07,799
I will have the freedom to cleave your neck from your shoulders

2168
04:00:08,440 --> 04:00:12,350
Do you agree?

2169
04:00:12,350 --> 04:00:15,709
Uh, I prefer to keep you in my debt if I lose you'll kill me

2170
04:00:16,799 --> 04:00:21,799
Very well

2171
04:00:21,799 --> 04:00:22,760

2172
04:00:22,760 --> 04:00:30,559
I just have to win. Let's go

2173
04:00:30,559 --> 04:00:41,309
Like your hands are your dice and takes the first bid just don't lose. So what are you doing? Car it my friend

2174
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:50,799
Three ones

2175
04:00:50,799 --> 04:00:54,809
Let's go fucking hard

2176
04:00:54,809 --> 04:01:00,190
Whoa

2177
04:01:00,190 --> 04:01:02,190
You don't have he has to have four of those

2178
04:01:03,610 --> 04:01:08,489
I will not allow your inane words to turn me from my game. So do not attempt such a strategy

2179
04:01:09,209 --> 04:01:14,909
There's no way

2180
04:01:14,909 --> 04:01:20,670
There are five threes. You gotta be shitting me dude. Really? That's so that's actually bullshit truly

2181
04:01:28,319 --> 04:01:35,610
Two ones

2182
04:01:35,690 --> 04:01:39,290
Three threes

2183
04:01:39,290 --> 04:01:41,290
Oh, no

2184
04:01:44,569 --> 04:01:46,170
What is this hand

2185
04:01:46,170 --> 04:01:49,049
This guy's got a full house. What is this twos and ones?

2186
04:01:54,969 --> 04:01:57,049
What is this? His both of his hands have been?

2187
04:01:58,149 --> 04:02:00,149
Outrageous they've been outrageous

2188
04:02:09,450 --> 04:02:18,799
I'm so screwed

2189
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:28,750
Yeah, I mean I have one of them call it. Uh

2190
04:02:30,729 --> 04:02:36,729
So he has to have three of them. Does he is he gonna have three of these? No, there's no way you don't have three

2191
04:02:37,680 --> 04:02:51,450
It's your whole hand call. There we are. All right, that's better one three

2192
04:03:01,360 --> 04:03:02,729
Two fours

2193
04:03:02,729 --> 04:03:10,379
Don't call it you piece of shit. You definitely have it

2194
04:03:15,319 --> 04:03:19,479
Okay, so i'm gonna say four. I have two that means he okay. Yeah, we're doing four

2195
04:03:20,489 --> 04:03:33,629
Call it. Yes

2196
04:03:33,629 --> 04:03:49,290
All right. This is not a bad hand. I'm gonna say two ones two

2197
04:03:50,010 --> 04:03:51,309
fours

2198
04:03:51,309 --> 04:03:58,780
Oh, you're in trouble. You're actually in trouble three fours call it four fours

2199
04:04:00,010 --> 04:04:02,700
Mmm

2200
04:04:02,700 --> 04:04:06,700
But should I say five fours? No, that's that has to mean that

2201
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:11,309
One of us has to have a full set

2202
04:04:11,309 --> 04:04:14,270
But what if he has two we have the same amount of uh dice

2203
04:04:19,440 --> 04:04:28,250
liar

2204
04:04:28,250 --> 04:04:30,719
one two

2205
04:04:30,719 --> 04:04:36,670
Uh, two twos three twos

2206
04:04:40,299 --> 04:04:48,520
You are stupid you are stupid what a comeback this is big

2207
04:04:50,170 --> 04:04:53,790
Uh, let's start with

2208
04:04:53,790 --> 04:05:12,639
One two one five, okay two ones call it. Okay, so he has a five fuck

2209
04:05:13,920 --> 04:05:17,200
He has a five so I have uh, I have a five too though

2210
04:05:18,440 --> 04:05:19,559
Three

2211
04:05:19,559 --> 04:05:26,250
No, I I keep saying five because I just see it as a regular dice. Don't call it

2212
04:05:29,120 --> 04:05:34,909
It's fine, whatever he's gonna win a round he picked the two worst possible things. It's all right

2213
04:05:38,379 --> 04:05:43,069
one three

2214
04:05:43,069 --> 04:05:49,629
Um one four two threes. Oh you lose

2215
04:05:52,200 --> 04:05:54,680
Ha you are in my debt now

2216
04:05:55,239 --> 04:05:58,270
Blanker

2217
04:05:58,270 --> 04:06:01,309
You flick flanker's final die off the table with a grin

2218
04:06:01,950 --> 04:06:02,989
I win

2219
04:06:02,989 --> 04:06:05,739
Blanker nods deeply

2220
04:06:05,739 --> 04:06:07,579
Sinler preserve me

2221
04:06:07,579 --> 04:06:09,709
I have lost to you again

2222
04:06:09,709 --> 04:06:15,450
Come with me. I will take you to the council. I want the spell lines

2223
04:06:16,649 --> 04:06:25,200
Council the leaders of kare are mad men and pirates, but not fools

2224
04:06:26,000 --> 04:06:28,559
They might be persuaded to see the sense of your mission

2225
04:06:29,370 --> 04:06:32,329
Especially if we have the gold to cover their pockets

2226
04:06:33,149 --> 04:06:36,700
Shall we go?

2227
04:06:36,700 --> 04:06:39,260
Where is the council?

2228
04:06:39,260 --> 04:06:40,780
It is hard to find

2229
04:06:40,780 --> 04:06:45,579
It is the tallest building in kare, but most of its height is built or underground

2230
04:06:46,059 --> 04:06:48,540
But from the street, it looks like just another dwelling place

2231
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:52,969
But I know where it is

2232
04:06:52,969 --> 04:06:58,139
Um, I kind of want to do my own path

2233
04:07:00,559 --> 04:07:01,360
but

2234
04:07:01,360 --> 04:07:13,850
Should we just go with them? What about your food? All right, let's go

2235
04:07:15,000 --> 04:07:19,000
Excellent flanker beams finishes his beer and then gestures to the door follow me

2236
04:07:24,120 --> 04:07:29,370
Follow flanker

2237
04:07:29,370 --> 04:07:33,450
You follow flanker across the top of the dock. He moves fast like a fleeting shadow

2238
04:07:33,850 --> 04:07:36,409
But somehow contrives to never disappear from your sight

2239
04:07:36,729 --> 04:07:44,299
He does not speak and your attempts at conversation are met with immediate silence at the council

2240
04:07:48,059 --> 04:07:54,909
Finally you arrive outside an ordinary looking building. This is it wait here and I will go inside

2241
04:07:56,059 --> 04:08:04,120
He disappears through the door the house into which flanker has gone is just that surely

2242
04:08:04,729 --> 04:08:06,969
The windows are thick bottle glass

2243
04:08:07,530 --> 04:08:14,940
And the door is tarred wood studded with rivets and painted black the roof only a single story up is overgrown with weeds

2244
04:08:15,500 --> 04:08:21,629
Other identical dwellings stand either side still nothing the building in front of you does not seem like any council chamber

2245
04:08:22,110 --> 04:08:26,079
Perhaps this is a trap

2246
04:08:26,079 --> 04:08:31,440
Um look in the windows you peer in through one of the windows

2247
04:08:31,840 --> 04:08:37,600
But the glass is so thick and heavily streaked on the inside with candle grease that you cannot make out anything

2248
04:08:41,100 --> 04:08:48,920
I'm gonna wait you wait flanker does not reappear. I will wait minutes pass

2249
04:08:51,629 --> 04:08:53,819
Wait time passes in the distance

2250
04:08:53,819 --> 04:08:57,020
You hear the sound of cartwheels rattling down the cobbles from the dock

2251
04:08:57,260 --> 04:09:06,829
They're quickly lost in the bustle of loakare. Wait, you hear the footsteps of the guard marching past

2252
04:09:07,149 --> 04:09:11,200
Perhaps they will come here, but then they turn away this place

2253
04:09:11,280 --> 04:09:19,639
It seems is not even important enough to warrant a visit long minutes pass

2254
04:09:22,520 --> 04:09:30,399
Time passes more time passes minutes pass. All right

2255
04:09:31,420 --> 04:09:45,079
All right. It's time to go because what if something happened to him one more one more more time one more one more

2256
04:09:45,319 --> 04:09:52,120
Try the door ignoring flankers instructions. You try the door. It is unlocked

2257
04:09:52,200 --> 04:10:01,639
I'm sorry, but like that was that was like 40 fucking minutes. That was 40 minutes something could have gone wrong

2258
04:10:05,399 --> 04:10:09,079
You were in a wide room chairs line the walls, but there is no other furniture

2259
04:10:09,639 --> 04:10:12,600
If this is someone's house, then it has become meticulously robbed

2260
04:10:13,309 --> 04:10:16,540
But if not, you cannot see what function it does serve

2261
04:10:16,700 --> 04:10:21,600
But it cannot be abandoned a fire in the hearth blazes out heat. There's no sign of flanker anywhere

2262
04:10:21,760 --> 04:10:50,540
But there are also no other doors god. It's too sus cast the spell and wait as a calm voice enters your mind

2263
04:10:51,020 --> 04:10:57,040
It speaks in reassuring tones telling that you are quite safe and everything in this room can be trusted

2264
04:10:57,680 --> 04:11:00,399
Although that not not everything is quite as it appears

2265
04:11:00,719 --> 04:11:08,219
Look at the fire you go over to the fire to warm your hands

2266
04:11:08,299 --> 04:11:16,190
It seems normal enough and it's hot enough to roast a pig a voice booms out from nowhere. Please be seated

2267
04:11:18,120 --> 04:11:21,959
Uh, okay

2268
04:11:21,959 --> 04:11:24,280
You choose a seat close to the fire and sit down

2269
04:11:25,159 --> 04:11:27,959
Something strange happens the moment you take your weight off your feet

2270
04:11:28,969 --> 04:11:34,319
It is as though the far wall no longer exists in its place is a long hallway

2271
04:11:34,719 --> 04:11:41,020
Lying with cloth banners and torches on brass poles two guards stand half way down the hallway

2272
04:11:41,659 --> 04:11:48,639
And between them you see a flanker deep in conversation. Yeah. Well, what the fuck? Why am I sitting out there?

2273
04:11:48,719 --> 04:11:53,610
Let me in you hang back and watch the scene. I'm sorry

2274
04:11:54,010 --> 04:11:58,889
The council is in session. You cannot be disturbing them. Blanker is shaking his head

2275
04:11:59,209 --> 04:12:07,680
That is incorrect as you well know the guard smiles tightly in reply blanker turns around and waves to you

2276
04:12:08,430 --> 04:12:16,809
Please join me. Yeah, what the fuck man you stand astride. You leave me outside for like an hour

2277
04:12:19,239 --> 04:12:24,200
I'm sorry, but there's always okay if i'm gonna if we're adventuring together you and I you and me us

2278
04:12:25,229 --> 04:12:28,270
And I say don't come in yet. Let me go in there you wait outside

2279
04:12:28,750 --> 04:12:31,450
But if more than 30 minutes pass

2280
04:12:32,299 --> 04:12:35,739
Come in with your swords run and be ready to fucking kill. You know what I mean?

2281
04:12:36,219 --> 04:12:45,530
Like you give a time limit if 35 minutes pass come get me because something horrible happened to be ready with a fucking magical fireball

2282
04:12:45,610 --> 04:13:01,719
Okay, always give a hard time limit the council. I'm afraid the council is in session. The guard repeats louder now

2283
04:13:03,049 --> 04:13:09,469
Wait, I need to see what are you talking about? We need to see them and I need to see them

2284
04:13:10,360 --> 04:13:15,760
No one sees the council when they are in session. Um, what does flanker do?

2285
04:13:16,510 --> 04:13:24,200
You hang back to see what flanker will do the assassin bows his cowled head. I am sorry for your family

2286
04:13:24,840 --> 04:13:30,520
He says quietly then a moment later his long steel blade is in his hands and at the neck of one of the guards

2287
04:13:33,600 --> 04:13:40,569
I didn't do it. I didn't do anything. Um, should I just let him do it? Should I go for the other guard?

2288
04:13:40,889 --> 04:13:45,360
All right, we're gonna go attack the other guard. I gotta follow flanker's lead here

2289
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:48,479
The two guards leap into defensive positions

2290
04:13:49,040 --> 04:13:54,559
Wielding their halberds weapons with reach hard to defend against and capable of doing unusual amounts of damage

2291
04:13:54,959 --> 04:14:01,870
All in the three fucking damage move the guard raises halberd

2292
04:14:02,190 --> 04:14:07,469
He is clearly shaking with fear hardly surprising since flanker is already besting his comrade

2293
04:14:08,170 --> 04:14:12,809
You feel the weight of your sword and bring it round to slice deeply across his chest

2294
04:14:13,049 --> 04:14:17,100
The council guard responds with a tough blow balancing strength and impact

2295
04:14:17,719 --> 04:14:23,129
But he has misjudged your strength and you knock him back you catch him deep in the side

2296
04:14:23,530 --> 04:14:29,319
His tunic reddens well played friend flanker murmurs from the other side of the hall

2297
04:14:30,159 --> 04:14:36,569
You see his arm grow tense. He is readying for a strong attack. Be aware. He's gonna attack you with a strong attack

2298
04:14:41,180 --> 04:14:45,760
All right, ow

2299
04:14:45,760 --> 04:14:50,719
Okay, so that he used a lot. So we're gonna go with like a small one like two like three three point. Oh three point one

2300
04:14:51,719 --> 04:14:53,559
That's okay

2301
04:14:53,559 --> 04:14:58,319
Three point one time to attack you swing your sword fast

2302
04:14:59,120 --> 04:15:09,120
Pants heavily he's toying with you. All right, should I defend i'm going all in he's coming in hard

2303
04:15:11,530 --> 04:15:13,530
Fuck it hurts so bad

2304
04:15:13,850 --> 04:15:15,850
flanker is back seating you

2305
04:15:16,989 --> 04:15:22,350
You whip up your defenses as he attempts a strong stroke flanker turns from his own fight to laugh deeply

2306
04:15:23,229 --> 04:15:25,790
I see you've lost none of your powers of foresight

2307
04:15:34,540 --> 04:15:36,540
Uh, let's go like 1.8

2308
04:15:38,379 --> 04:15:40,959
All right. Now we go

2309
04:15:40,959 --> 04:15:45,840
Things are getting serious. The guard is now fighting for his life. You see his biceps tense. He's preparing to strike hard

2310
04:15:46,399 --> 04:15:48,920
more than six

2311
04:15:48,920 --> 04:15:50,120
Yes

2312
04:15:50,120 --> 04:15:53,420
What was that?

2313
04:15:53,420 --> 04:15:59,340
That was flanker and the other guy he was looking over laughing while clang clang clang clang clang clang with fighting the other guy

2314
04:15:59,659 --> 04:16:06,920
What do you mean? What was that? You know exactly what the hell that was. He's like

2315
04:16:09,899 --> 04:16:13,799
They're sword fighting next to me

2316
04:16:13,799 --> 04:16:15,680
All right

2317
04:16:15,680 --> 04:16:20,399
Uh, it is enough time to finish him the guard collapses backwards against the stone floor of the chamber

2318
04:16:20,799 --> 04:16:24,319
At the same time you hear a second scream. The other fight has ended as well

2319
04:16:24,559 --> 04:16:30,649
Flanker has cut his man down you and your comrade clean your blades

2320
04:16:31,049 --> 04:16:37,790
Flanker says a short prayer and then tastes a fingertip of blood from his victim opening the door

2321
04:16:38,190 --> 04:16:46,200
He gestures for you to go first council. This is the main council chamber

2322
04:16:48,280 --> 04:16:53,819
Rewind stop. Okay sip. Okay. Let's do that again

2323
04:16:55,600 --> 04:16:57,680
This is the main council chamber of caray

2324
04:16:57,680 --> 04:17:04,920
That's a hard sentence a wide room with a domed roof supported by tall pillars ornately carved with monsters

2325
04:17:05,319 --> 04:17:09,799
serpents and instruments of torture in the center

2326
04:17:10,280 --> 04:17:15,239
12 throne-like seats are arranged in a circle with one on a raised dais

2327
04:17:16,090 --> 04:17:23,879
Presumably the seat of the first noble all are empty a chalk circle has been drawn just inside the ring of thrones

2328
04:17:24,700 --> 04:17:36,239
Flanker frowns. This is not right walk around the chairs. You make a slow circle of the chairs

2329
04:17:36,639 --> 04:17:43,370
Flanker doing likewise in the other direction. No one here. No secret doors. No hidden passages

2330
04:17:44,760 --> 04:17:47,319
You notice the chairs all have names on their backs

2331
04:17:47,559 --> 04:17:55,100
The throne of the first noble has the name sansis embossed in gold leaf on its back

2332
04:17:55,260 --> 04:18:02,670
The names of the others are smaller and fashioned from plain iron mulas tiffin lorag shinva

2333
04:18:03,069 --> 04:18:08,350
Ziren and theta it would seem that none of the chairs have been satin for a very long time

2334
04:18:09,690 --> 04:18:18,799
Sitting the throne over the circle you approach the chalk circle. It appears to be just what it seems

2335
04:18:19,280 --> 04:18:24,860
A circle inscribed on the stone floor of the room. The only remarkable thing about it is how perfect it is

2336
04:18:25,260 --> 04:18:28,200
It is a flawless curve

2337
04:18:28,600 --> 04:18:31,780
Rather too well drawn that makes me suspicious

2338
04:18:35,260 --> 04:18:41,159
Don't fucking walk into the circle. Don't you dare i'm gonna sit in the throne

2339
04:18:41,399 --> 04:18:46,030
You walk back to the first noble's chair and lower yourself down

2340
04:18:46,510 --> 04:18:53,149
Crossing your legs and surveying the room. Flanker looks up from his forensic investigations of the chalk circle with amusement

2341
04:18:53,469 --> 04:18:59,079
Should I go in let's just should I go into it? I don't remember

2342
04:19:01,959 --> 04:19:08,559
I don't remember what happens does something bad happen? What happens? I don't remember

2343
04:19:12,479 --> 04:19:24,139
Leave leave leave is it I I think something bad happens. There is nothing here. This has been a waste of time

2344
04:19:24,459 --> 04:19:30,989
You remarked to flanker the assassin shakes his head. Perhaps i've learned something

2345
04:19:31,600 --> 04:19:40,989
He points to the circle on the floor. Do you see that? I think that is a portal trap. No, it's not

2346
04:19:41,549 --> 04:19:42,670
What's a portal trap?

2347
04:19:42,670 --> 04:19:50,280
The portal traps of kare will build to protect citizens in one area of kare from the citizens in other areas

2348
04:19:51,200 --> 04:19:58,809
Each region dwarf towns finnville the rest were given one trap to place as they saw fit and to move whenever they chose

2349
04:19:59,610 --> 04:20:07,420
Then if anyone from a neighboring town attacked they could not tell what was a trap and what wasn't so what is this doing here?

2350
04:20:07,659 --> 04:20:14,280
Now that is a very good question by all logic. It should not be here. They are quite invisible

2351
04:20:14,520 --> 04:20:23,600
They can appear as anything but should you stand in one you will be transported. But where are the nobles?

2352
04:20:25,159 --> 04:20:29,930
Blanker looks as puzzled as you I cannot believe they fell for their own trap

2353
04:20:30,680 --> 04:20:38,379
They are fools, but not such fools as that but here is a portal and they say sansis entered yet never left

2354
04:20:41,870 --> 04:20:47,920
Transported where you ask looking at the chalk circle of curiosity wherever the center chooses

2355
04:20:48,620 --> 04:20:53,000
Inside solid rock high in midair the tradition in kare has been to dump

2356
04:20:53,379 --> 04:20:56,670
Unfortunates into the sewers most do not come back

2357
04:20:57,739 --> 04:20:59,979
Blanker moves suddenly towards the door then turns to you

2358
04:21:00,219 --> 04:21:12,799
But the important thing about traps is that they are no longer under the control of the people of kare who controls them now

2359
04:21:13,760 --> 04:21:21,469
Your naivety is most pleasing. What do you think when a people is given something of power who takes that thing away?

2360
04:21:22,239 --> 04:21:27,479
The nobles of course for many years now every trap in kare has been moved and placed

2361
04:21:27,959 --> 04:21:37,399
By sansis himself and where is sansis now? He's not here indeed indeed not

2362
04:21:38,750 --> 04:21:44,280
Blanker turns about once more. I have seen enough. I must think on what we've seen

2363
04:21:49,690 --> 04:21:56,040
So why are the guards here? Are the guards just sitting here? The guards were just outside the door?

2364
04:21:58,299 --> 04:22:04,889
No, you can't you can't go there. Sorry. They're it's in session right now. How long were they there for?

2365
04:22:07,760 --> 04:22:12,489
We just killed two random guards for absolutely. No reason. They were just npc guards

2366
04:22:14,239 --> 04:22:24,940
They were just hanging out. I could step into it. Should I step i'm going in i'll remind if it sucks

2367
04:22:27,290 --> 04:22:30,090
With his attention turned you take a deep breath you step towards the chalk circle

2368
04:22:30,170 --> 04:22:32,350
You feel nothing as you cross the boundary

2369
04:22:32,350 --> 04:22:44,479
But one moment you are in the council chamber and your foot touches nothing inside and you are falling back in the sewer

2370
04:22:52,409 --> 04:23:16,319
Shit, all right back it up. No, no, no, no, no, don't do it twice. No back up. Okay. There we go

2371
04:23:19,760 --> 04:23:23,639
Oh, we have to do this again. It's fine. And that's probably i'm gonna call it here

2372
04:23:23,879 --> 04:23:27,129
I mentioned that I wanted to do more streams this week

2373
04:23:27,129 --> 04:23:32,920
But less time because i'm still not feeling great and i've got to go do something. I got something I have to do

2374
04:23:33,639 --> 04:23:35,959
Uh that might take a while. So sorry

2375
04:23:37,079 --> 04:23:41,159
Sorry

2376
04:23:41,159 --> 04:23:42,840
So if you weren't here at the beginning of the stream

2377
04:23:42,840 --> 04:23:48,329
I said that I was only going to go for like three or four hours and we were going to stream tomorrow and thursday and then saturday

2378
04:23:52,350 --> 04:23:58,090
I'm going to get to this point here. So tomorrow we're going to just pick up right where we left off here

2379
04:23:59,120 --> 04:24:08,479
We are absolutely going to get through part two tomorrow and likely start at least the beginning of part three thursday something else is happening

2380
04:24:09,819 --> 04:24:13,200
Which I don't I can't really talk about right now because I don't know

2381
04:24:13,840 --> 04:24:15,840
Exactly, what is going to happen?

2382
04:24:16,639 --> 04:24:22,879
So I don't want to like talk about something that either does or doesn't happen, but should be fun and then saturday

2383
04:24:24,250 --> 04:24:39,040
Is green screen movie night part two? Is it a sponsored stream? No, it's not something else. But yeah, we're um,

2384
04:24:39,440 --> 04:24:48,649
We'll be back. We'll be back tomorrow and I say we and I mean me maybe you if you come back and watch

2385
04:24:49,610 --> 04:24:54,969
Okay, cool. That makes me suspicious. Let's leave. There's nothing here portal traps. Yes. What does that do add clues?

2386
04:24:55,049 --> 04:25:02,350
What does it look like interesting? Oh, okay transported where can you avoid them? How where the nobles I don't know

2387
04:25:02,750 --> 04:25:10,510
Where does a trap go? I don't know who controls them. Why is there a trap here? Who is I gotta get all this info?

2388
04:25:10,750 --> 04:25:16,000
Okay, let's get out of here. All right, so blanker and I are leaving the council chamber

2389
04:25:19,389 --> 04:25:24,319
And we are gonna call it right here when I get out

2390
04:25:27,049 --> 04:25:32,889
The road climbs further looping back on itself as it climbs several little alleys disappear off between homes and buildings on either side

2391
04:25:33,290 --> 04:25:40,829
This area of town is a spider's web that would be easy to lose oneself in you pass a shop with a brass sign above its door

2392
04:25:41,389 --> 04:25:55,069
Metal workers guild. However, it seems to be closed for the night. Oh, it's closed. Okay

2393
04:25:56,350 --> 04:26:06,090
Uh, I sneezed and i'm gonna sneeze again. So we'll call it here

2394
04:26:06,489 --> 04:26:12,000
We need to go remind me tomorrow that we need to go down here. This is the next

2395
04:26:22,520 --> 04:26:25,229
destination

2396
04:26:25,229 --> 04:26:29,469
So this is where we're gonna go. It's a bit

2397
04:26:30,350 --> 04:26:37,040
I mean, I really am sneezing but i'm pressing the view button a little like a half second too late, right?

2398
04:26:40,889 --> 04:26:43,209
We need to go to the falling quarter get the last line

2399
04:26:44,139 --> 04:26:52,030
And then I will tell you if we get the last line down here for the first time in me ever playing sorcery

2400
04:26:52,510 --> 04:26:54,809
Will I leave kare?

2401
04:26:54,809 --> 04:26:59,930
Without just saying fuck it. I don't care lorag come with me. This would be this would be the first time

2402
04:27:00,799 --> 04:27:06,559
So that's cool. I usually just go through it and go. Ah, whatever. I don't care and then just keep going

2403
04:27:09,040 --> 04:27:11,520
Okay, that's it. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We're gonna complete part two

2404
04:27:11,520 --> 04:27:13,680
We'll do a little bit part three and then some other stuff

2405
04:27:14,590 --> 04:27:19,760
We'll take a break from sorcery. Uh this coming week and we'll see if you guys really like it

2406
04:27:19,840 --> 04:27:23,520
I mean this seems like a lot of people are just having fun hanging out. It's a chill thing to do

2407
04:27:24,809 --> 04:27:26,559
it's really just

2408
04:27:26,559 --> 04:27:32,540
Nice, it feels nice to play so we'll see you tomorrow. Thanks for watching everybody tomorrow

2409
04:27:32,700 --> 04:27:41,719

4pm pacific. We'll see if you're gonna show up. We got we'll be streaming pretty much all week. See you tomorrow

2411
04:27:53,879 --> 04:28:12,299
Good night and goodbye and then baseball right that baseball is um, not long after that baseball's the 19th

2412
04:28:12,540 --> 04:28:23,659
I wonder what what could we do next week if we could if we finish part two of sorcery tomorrow start part three

2413
04:28:24,430 --> 04:28:28,559
Do this thing on thursday potentially green screen on saturday

2414
04:28:29,850 --> 04:28:31,920
um

2415
04:28:31,920 --> 04:28:37,680
Because i'm not yeah next week is going to be the last week of like regular streams because obviously

2416
04:28:38,399 --> 04:28:41,200
Um leading up to baseball i'm gonna have to spend a lot of time on it

2417
04:28:42,959 --> 04:28:51,629
We'll figure we'll do something fun. What time is baseball? I think it's gonna be

2418
04:28:52,440 --> 04:28:57,079
At like three or four o'clock in the afternoon. I'll get you guys a hard date

04:29:05,920 --> 04:29:08,159
It's either gonna be i'm trying to think of when it would be okay

2421
04:29:08,479 --> 04:29:12,520
It's either gonna be like three or like two

2422
04:29:13,680 --> 04:29:32,829
PM you're gonna give us a hard time play stray

2423
04:29:34,360 --> 04:29:39,520
I keep seeing people talk about how that's like the greatest video game ever made. Is it really that good?

2424
04:29:44,750 --> 04:30:02,889
Is stray that unbelievable? I keep people keep talking about how unbelievable amazing of a game it is. I don't know. Maybe we'll see
