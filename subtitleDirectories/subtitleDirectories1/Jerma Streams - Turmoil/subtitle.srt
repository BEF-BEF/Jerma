1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,209
Alright, what are we doing? Uh, Turmoil. I wanna try Turmoil.

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:11,619
Peglin. Yep, Peglin's on the list.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,300
Listen, uh, Turmoil looks really cool. I'm really interested.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:27,989
This is a game where you get oil or something.

5
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,619
Do a WoW stream and it's out.

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:01:05,049
Okay. So, start new campaign, right? Let me do the setting.

7
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,730
Graphics. Good. Very good. 60 FPS.

8
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,420
Uh, yep, yep, yep. Okay. Audio is fine.

9
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:21,060
Everything seems good to go. Okay, let's start.

10
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:37,939
Okay. So, select, choose your character. I'm gonna play as Joshua.

11
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:42,120
Howdy, partner. This dude has been herding cattle

12
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,400
long enough to know that nights on the prairie are cold and lonely.

13
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,340
Hope earning money with oil is as easy as throwing lasso.

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,909
Yes. Hi there, future oil baron. Welcome to my soon-to-be-lovely town.

15
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,000
The oil industry will be booming here. Let's get to work.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,400
Click on the wagon and I'll show you the basics of oil drilling.

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,239
Hop on and I'll take you to the oil site.

18
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,819
Welcome to your first oil mining operation.

19
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:12,379
Just follow my instructions and the oil will be flowing in no time.

20
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,460
Before you can start drilling for oil, you have to know where to drill.

21
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,900
Hire a dowser to take care of this.

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:45,560
You found oil. It's time to start drilling. Select the oil rig.

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,729
Oil can be always be found somewhere below a dowser.

24
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:56,139
So, place the rig right here. Literally hit me in the head with a wrench.

25
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,219
Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point to connect the oil.

26
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:07,740
Drag downwards from this point and release at the other point.

27
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:16,539
How far down should I go? Oh, okay.

28
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,819
I know I'm going to love this game. I'm going to be obsessed.

29
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,860
You struck oil, but where should you take it?

30
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,520
The left ink, of course. Select the horse wagon.

31
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,919
Put a wagon here. I'll make like oil and unload it in my company. Cha-ching.

32
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:50,069
They wouldn't have said that back in like the fucking 1100s.

33
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:59,259
This introduction ends when you brought the cash amount back up to 1350.

34
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,199
Okay, got it. Back to town.

35
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,180
Good job. Now it's time for the real work.

36
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,500
Come to town hall and meet your rivals and get yourself a parcel of land for your next venture.

37
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,659
Oh no, don't make me do it.

38
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,939
Don't make me do the thing that won worst impression of the year last year.

39
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,060
No, I don't want to do it. I will.

40
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:30,060
Hello there. Does being a lawyer sound interesting?

41
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,740
Well, in truth, it's kind of boring and I couldn't handle it.

42
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,819
I've got a serious case of oil fever and the only cure is finding oil.

43
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,420
That's what literally lost.

44
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:54,980
That was the worst thing I ever did last year, apparently.

45
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,899
20 grand for what? It still is.

46
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,660
I know. I'm just reminding you.

47
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,019
You can't vote for that twice, though.

48
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,139
That's important to know.

49
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:19,379
Why can I barely hear this?

50
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,529
Oh my God. I just came to a really crazy realization about the way my brain works.

51
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,209
The reason why that's the way that I do the Daniel Day Lewis,

52
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,360
I drink your milkshake routine is because I'm skipping through the fucking video.

53
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,029
That's why I'm doing that.

54
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:51,610
What the fuck?

55
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,610
Yeah, don't come snivel.

56
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,459
This is insane.

57
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,100
It's from me skipping through the movie because I like want to maybe get to a scene

58
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
or maybe I'm skipping through a certain scene.

59
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:18,810
It's really weird to think about that.

60
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:28,470
Anyways, let's play this game.

61
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:35,610
It's like this.

62
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,930
Yeah, I've seen this. This is one of my favorite videos.

63
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,500
It's not possible for me to not laugh at this video.

64
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,300
I'll try.

65
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,459
I'm going to try as hard as I can to not laugh at this video.

66
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,139
It's cheating, though, because it's impossible.

67
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:14,040
I genuinely think this is impossible.

68
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,899
Let's see if I can do it.

69
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,870
What do I get if I make it?

70
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,220
What do I get? What do I get if I make it?

71
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,960
It's this fucking stupid like soy pointing meme.

72
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,320
God damn it.

73
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,639
He does the like the point thing.

74
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,299
God fucking damn it.

75
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:54,700
Really?

76
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,919
Unbelievable.

77
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,440
Un-fucking-believable.

78
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,370
I can't believe it, man.

79
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:11,769
Whatever.

80
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,610
Okay, I'm going to try from here.

81
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:38,919
I just spit all over this microphone right here.

82
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,200
Once Macho Man's shows up, it's over because I know he will.

83
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:50,620
Macho Man's is the best without a doubt.

84
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:19,590
I think I'm good.

85
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:19,990
I'm good.

86
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm good.

87
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,549
I'm good.

88
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:20,950
I'm good.

89
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,509
Help them.

90
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,990
Help them.

91
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:33,990
The same guy?

92
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:20,539
Banjo-Kazooie character.

93
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,659
Like a bellows with eyes on it.

94
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,299
You know what I mean?

95
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,460
Logan Paul?

96
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:37,539
What?

97
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,220
It does.

98
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,940
No, it does.

99
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,340
Does it?

100
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,759
Him in the back with like the thing.

101
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,580
Older Logan Paul.

102
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:06,899
Wow.

103
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,659
That's insane.

104
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,909
All right, I'm going to play the one that...

105
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,470
I'm going to move on in a second, I promise.

106
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,179
Let me get this one real quick.

107
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,279
This one's short, I promise.

108
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:42,889
Where is he?

109
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,299
There it is.

110
00:13:50,179 --> 00:14:15,830
Why is there Superman in this?

111
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,830
Oh, for a second, I thought Superman was going to be like...

112
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,309
I thought they were going to do it with the Superman movie.

113
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,029
I was like, what?

114
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,309
I was like, no, they're not.

115
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:38,470
Ready?

116
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,720
What the fuck is this video?

117
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:06,070
Yeah.

118
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,539
Okay, I've had enough.

119
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:26,659
I can't do it anymore.

120
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,340
I wonder if somebody did that with my stream.

121
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,500
What would that sound like?

122
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:45,529
Would it be as fucked up?

123
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,330
It would be worse.

124
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,330
I'm trying to think of how I talk.

125
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,820
Like, hey, what's going on?

126
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,779
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.

127
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:51,980
I made a nice living in real estate,

128
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,340
but it's time for a new business plan.

129
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,870
I do it.

130
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,620
Now I'm going to think about that a lot.

131
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:07,110
Okay, we have to play a game.

132
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay, so let's get to work.

133
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,840
Buenos Dias, I've sailed the world as a ship captain for years

134
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,879
and I can't even swim.

135
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,240
I don't want to worry about drowning anymore unless it's in money.

136
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,039
Let me assign you to your own piece of land.

137
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,080
The first one is on the house.

138
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,740
Oh, is this a risk?

139
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Good day to celebrate the opening of my brand new bank.

140
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,419
I've opened an account for each of you.

141
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,649
If you need to borrow extra cash

142
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,889
or come by to view a financial report of your last venture.

143
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,259
Okay, so this is me, right?

144
00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:54,519
Let's get that oil.

145
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,320
We're taking $2,000 with us to cover the start costs.

146
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
Are you ready to go?

147
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,429
All right, let's do it.

148
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,389
I need dowsers.

149
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,720
Got something?

150
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,200
Got something?

151
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,220
Let's go.

152
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,769
How far down should I go?

153
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:36,230
Should I go?

154
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:37,589
Wait, what did I do?

155
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,769
Did I screw this up?

156
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:49,849
What just happened?

157
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,019
How do I have no money?

158
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:30,579
I have 20 grand.

159
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:45,539
When did I spend $914?

160
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,500
I have to...

161
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:13,480
Okay, wait.

162
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,019
I found a way to increase the capacity of pipes.

163
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:18,140
Highly recommended.

164
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,460
Okay, so I have to find that shit.

165
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,240
All right, no, get out of here.

166
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,839
I'm not gonna spend seven grand right now.

167
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,890
I have a piece of land at the town hall.

168
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh yes, I was expecting you.

169
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,039
What can I do for you?

170
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,759
Land auction.

171
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,559
Let's gather all the tenants together to auction.

172
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,220
Okay, let's go.

173
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,309
In turns, you decide which plot of land you get to mine next year.

174
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,809
On your turn, click on a parcel to bid on it.

175
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,890
You can outbid others by clicking on their parcels.

176
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,670
The numbers on the plots that have been mined,

177
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,240
they indicate how much oil was in that plot.

178
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:04,039
Okay, so there's probably oil here and here.

179
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,759
I'm gonna say here.

180
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,269
I'm going here.

181
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:14,150
That's it, right?

182
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,119
Okay.

183
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,640
Yeah, all you got no money left.

184
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,529
I got 17k left.

185
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:34,109
I'm gonna buy the width.

186
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:38,809
I feel like everybody else did that too.

187
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,460
All right, I understand how it works now, I think.

188
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:46,009
So to upgrade pipes capacity, just click on it.

189
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:56,400
Price is always right at right inc.

190
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,769
I mean, it is more, it is better.

191
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,650
I don't know, buy one cent though.

192
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,289
I don't really care.

193
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:16,619
All right, so where would it be?

194
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:17,500
Where should I dig?

195
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,160
Left and right Twix.

196
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:29,240
You got some?

197
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:51,660
Why would you make me do that for money?

198
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:34,750
Fuck!

199
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,309
Stop!

200
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,859
What do I do?

201
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:39,740
How do I stop?

202
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,140
Stop!

203
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,460
Stop!

204
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,619
Stop!

205
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:41,660
How do I stop the thing from going?

206
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
Did I not hit oil?

207
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Oh, thank God I did.

208
00:22:44,960 --> 00:23:05,799
All right, deliver.

209
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,630
85 cents go that way.

210
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,509
How do I do this?

211
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:11,710
How do I deliver?

212
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,990
How do I deliver to that way?

213
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,019
How do I, where?

214
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:15,980
Click the arrow, up arrow?

215
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:19,950
90 cents over there, let's go.

216
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,329
92 cents of gallon or whatever the hell it is.

217
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:36,299
What do I do about this?

218
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,380
What the fuck is happening, dude?

219
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,779
I just spent all that money on like a second drill.

220
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,559
I don't, I don't, I didn't mean to do that.

221
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,109
Should I do it over here?

222
00:23:48,829 --> 00:24:13,359
Stop going that way.

223
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,319
Stop this way.

224
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:37,079
What does this swimming pool do?

225
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,430
Okay, how can I go down?

226
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,390
Branch limit reach.

227
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,589
Can I delete this?

228
00:24:44,589 --> 00:25:05,869
Does that mean it's going to explode or something?

229
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:33,130
Stop the quad.

230
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,099
Stop, stop, stop.

231
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,759
I'm ready to go this way.

232
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,640
I got 2,500.

233
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:32,079
Oil is limited.

234
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:34,079
Yeah, well, there's probably plenty over here.

235
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,319
There's probably a shitload over here.

236
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:51,640
This is filling up.

237
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,950
That's for a year, right?

238
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,750
I got plenty of time.

239
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,319
Yeah, yeah, the one.

240
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,819
Yes, dude.

241
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:19,119
What are you talking about?

242
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,160
What the fuck just happened?

243
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,039
You're spilling oil.

244
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,799
Fix it by buying new wagons

245
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,519
or by reducing the number of wagons selling oil.

246
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,819
What do you mean reduce the number of wagons

247
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:51,019
when I want more wagons?

248
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,529
It's flown into here too.

249
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:58,009
I have three things that just don't work.

250
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:36,319
What does this do then?

251
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,839
I thought this was going to take the overflow.

252
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,970
Oh, they take from the overflow.

253
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,289
I thought this was going to spill into here.

254
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:59,579
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

255
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,220
Fill it up, fill it up.

256
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,940
Take all the oil.

257
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,339
Take it all.

258
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:11,720
The buck 12 right now.

259
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,000
Get rid of all of it.

260
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,200
No, don't store it.

261
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,480
Why are you storing it?

262
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,400
Go sell it that way.

263
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,480
Sell the oil.

264
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,440
Why you don't?

265
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
No, pick up the oil and sell it over here.

266
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:36,809
I got 6K.

267
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:37,369
I'm all right.

268
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:40,519
2,500 in profit.

269
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,240
I'm all right.

270
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,019
Paid more than this fucking moron.

271
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,210
What the hell did she do?

272
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,269
Okay, nice to meet you.

273
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm Edward and I'm a bit of a handyman.

274
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,150
I like to experiment with stuff

275
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,750
that can help you find oil.

276
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,349
Make sure to check out my inventions.

277
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:10,319
Okay.

278
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,900
I improved the dowsing rod so dowsers can search deeper.

279
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,799
Tired of dowsers taking forever?

280
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,309
Would you like to have this lovely mole?

281
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,549
He'll dig for you, but he's kind of erratic.

282
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,220
Yeah, of course I want the mole.

283
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm broke now.

284
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,720
I have no money.

285
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,279
I'm in trouble.

286
00:30:35,839 --> 00:31:02,359
Going up here.

287
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,829
That's what I just bid on.

288
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,720
How much is this for?

289
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,519
3,000?

290
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:18,890
Oh my God.

291
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,680
He has a dumb.

292
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,920
Okay, I got five grand.

293
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,220
You have cash to pay back William

294
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,460
before your current loan becomes final.

295
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,099
You want me to go pay the guy back $5,000

296
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,940
that just gave me $5,000

297
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,859
and be left with $142 left.

298
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,680
How would I do that?

299
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,279
Okay.

300
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,420
I have a mole now.

301
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,960
Mole.

302
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,240
Look, somewhere in the ground,

303
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,519
the mole will uncover this spot

304
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,640
and then dig around to uncover five more random spots.

305
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,559
Okay, right here.

306
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,019
Let's see if this is worth it.

307
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,539
Worth it?

308
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,240
Oh, hi.

309
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Yeah.

310
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:38,079
Yes, sure.

311
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:40,970
Okay.

312
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,369
Very important that I get this right.

313
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,349
I'm going to say right here.

314
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:50,829
Right here.

315
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,839
Perfect.

316
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:02,720
Perfect.

317
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,559
Let's increase the fucking width on this thing, please.

318
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:21,230
Extend, extend it.

319
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,470
How?

320
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,490
I don't know how to do that.

321
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:24,809
Open it.

322
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,079
What do I do?

323
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,519
The mole got eaten by an alligator or something.

324
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:33,720
He's not doing anything anymore.

325
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,200
What happened?

326
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,460
Why is the mole gone?

327
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,180
Is the mole dead?

328
00:33:38,269 --> 00:33:39,150
Hold the end of it.

329
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:43,390
Oh, shit.

330
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:43,710
Okay.

331
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,799
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

332
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:59,549
I have no money.

333
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,679
Oh, I get it.

334
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:20,920
Okay.

335
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:28,940
Come on, dig something.

336
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,389
Shit.

337
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,159
Have one horse never sell.

338
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,750
Why?

339
00:34:49,309 --> 00:35:07,920
So it just stores it.

340
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,239
Really?

341
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,090
Oh, I see what you mean.

342
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,849
So it just goes like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

343
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,050
Where is the oil in this map?

344
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:25,369
How much did I pay for this?

345
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,039
Finally.

346
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:31,280
All right.

347
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
We got double oil now.

348
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Uh-oh, this is almost gone.

349
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:09,920
What happens if this bullet fills up?

350
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,559
Does this overflow?

351
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:14,730
It probably doesn't, right?

352
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:34,039
Why do you do that many horses?

353
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,840
Because they're not going to be...

354
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,039
I need to sell this oil.

355
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:41,849
And they are not doing it fast enough.

356
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,539
Okay, this is done, right?

357
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:45,019
So now what?

358
00:36:45,019 --> 00:36:46,139
Just close this out?

359
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,079
Or is that it?

360
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,679
Should I douse?

361
00:36:50,679 --> 00:37:05,130
All right, we got to get...

362
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,250
I got to get more horses.

363
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,849
I'm not going to be able to sell all of this.

364
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:11,840
I need to go deeper, deeper, deeper.

365
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:22,110
Shit.

366
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,909
Okay, that's right here.

367
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,239
Yeah, I found it before you did.

368
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,760
Why even use that person?

369
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:44,090
Can you fire horses?

370
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,809
Can I get rid of people?

371
00:37:45,369 --> 00:38:13,130
All right.

372
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,369
Now we're going to get started loading oil up like crazy.

373
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:25,900
I need more.

374
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,780
I want more.

375
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,179
I need more.

376
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:43,929
All right.

377
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,530
We need somebody to store some oil.

378
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:49,550
Let's store it.

379
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:51,289
And then...

380
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,059
Oh, shit.

381
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:54,780
I can do double.

382
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,420
This guy not found oil yet?

383
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,280
This guy's been walking around for 10 minutes straight.

384
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:05,800
Oh, final month.

385
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,039
Okay.

386
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:11,840
Sell all.

387
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,639
Sell all.

388
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:12,880
How?

389
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,989
Can I sell the horses?

390
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:51,949
Okay, I'm going to pay the loan off.

391
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,510
Immediately.

392
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:55,760
It's too late to change to the left side.

393
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,559
Oh, right side I'm in.

394
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,110
Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell it.

395
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:07,980
Bullshit.

396
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,260
This is a lot of oil here.

397
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,139
It was literally two, three patches.

398
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:12,780
What?

399
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,320
Did I pay it off?

400
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,269
15,000 in earnings.

401
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:21,309
I spent five grand.

402
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:22,750
Banked at six.

403
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,190
I didn't pay the bank yet.

404
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:28,300
I didn't pay the bank yet.

405
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:34,760
Oh, I'm Rainer, the trainer.

406
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,079
I take care of the horses to keep them healthy and ready for work.

407
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,880
Drop by my stables.

408
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,840
Maybe we can help each other.

409
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,190
Did I?

410
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,429
Wait.

411
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,320
I paid it back already?

412
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,800
Why would it cover my debt right away?

413
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,159
What if I didn't want to do that right away?

414
00:40:53,719 --> 00:41:00,969
You track up how many horses you have with this handy horse counter.

415
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,929
Is it worth $5,000 to know that I have six horses?

416
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,469
Okay, here we go.

417
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,480
Depth.

418
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,920
Dowsers can search deeper.

419
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:16,730
They find oil faster.

420
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,030
Size.

421
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,039
Oh, I like that.

422
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,639
I don't have enough money though.

423
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,199
I don't have enough.

424
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:38,920
Okay, let's go.

425
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,559
I'm going up.

426
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:41,449
Up top here.

427
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:49,309
I think people are sleeping on this one.

428
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,400
All right.

429
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,519
Now I'm ready.

430
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,760
I'm ready to rock and roll.

431
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,769
Let's get some profit here.

432
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:06,489
No more loans.

433
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,289
No more bullshit.

434
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:13,880
Go find me some oil so I can get started right away in January.

435
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,280
And get the silo down too.

436
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:16,760
Immediately.

437
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,239
Right in the middle.

438
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:18,440
Go.

439
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,840
I'm ready.

440
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:20,940
You know what?

441
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,820
Put a mole down here.

442
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:29,929
Make it snappy.

443
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:36,460
Oh, mole found oil.

444
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,420
Look at that.

445
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:48,880
I'm putting one here.

446
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,769
I got to strike something here.

447
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,789
Thank God.

448
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:56,030
All right.

449
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,030
Put it down a little bit more.

450
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:06,780
All right.

451
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,460
I'm ready to rock and roll.

452
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,260
I keep saying that.

453
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,219
I said that like five times.

454
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:20,880
I'm going to get the guaranteed one here.

455
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:28,889
Oh, shit.

456
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:29,690
Oh, shit.

457
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,329
Oh, shit.

458
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:30,969
Oh, shit.

459
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:31,530
Oh, shit.

460
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,489
Oh, shit.

461
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:32,969
Oh, shit.

462
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,090
Oh, shit.

463
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:34,489
Come on.

464
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:34,730
Come on.

465
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,050
Come on.

466
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:35,369
Come on.

467
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:35,610
Come on.

468
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:35,769
Come on.

469
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:36,409
Give me 150.

470
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:36,570
Come on.

471
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:36,730
Come on.

472
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:36,889
Come on.

473
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:36,969
Come on.

474
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:44,719
150, 150, 150, 150.

475
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:45,199
Dude.

476
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,480
Come on.

477
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,159
Just suck it up already.

478
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,360
Nobody.

479
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,199
Just deposit it for now.

480
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:52,639
Suck it up.

481
00:43:53,519 --> 00:44:03,659
All right.

482
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:06,059
We're going left because I have to go left.

483
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,260
I don't care if I lose out on money.

484
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,340
It's the fastest way to sell so I can base more horses.

485
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:19,980
Holy shit.

486
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,179
This thing is flowing.

487
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,940
Look at how much this is just flowing.

488
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:33,519
All right.

489
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:34,559
I think we're in good shape.

490
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:35,920
I'm going to have two people sell.

491
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,019
Now we can start to really flow some money.

492
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:45,000
Here we go.

493
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,840
I'm getting the guaranteed one over here.

494
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:57,150
Expensive, but it should be all right.

495
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:14,219
Beautiful.

496
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,579
Nice job, mole.

497
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,909
Nice job, mole.

498
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,599
Breaking the dough.

499
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:45,929
Nice.

500
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,300
Good find.

501
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,860
Good find.

502
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:57,639
All right.

503
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:04,760
Start selling it.

504
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,400
I'm going to start to see a huge amount of flow here now.

505
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,000
This is going to get wacky.

506
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,800
I need more horses.

507
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,320
Prices are pretty much the same.

508
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:19,840
We'll do half and half.

509
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,320
Prices are pretty close.

510
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:27,599
Where is this?

511
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:41,719
Shit.

512
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:41,960
Yes.

513
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,070
All right.

514
00:46:59,070 --> 00:46:59,789
Stop selling.

515
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:00,510
Stop selling.

516
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,510
It's dog shit prices.

517
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,389
Stop selling.

518
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:12,920
Dog shit prices.

519
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,880
Stop selling.

520
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,840
Prices are dog shit.

521
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:34,480
Uh-oh.

522
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,280
Jesus.

523
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,599
Okay.

524
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,000
Hold on.

525
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:38,559
Don't sell anything until it's at least a dollar.

526
00:47:53,150 --> 00:48:07,980
You look green.

527
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:10,170
Gremlin.

528
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,320
That's fine.

529
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,440
Do I need more horses?

530
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:20,670
They're going to start taking from the reserves, right?

531
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:30,510
I need more horses, don't I?

532
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:33,449
They're not.

533
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,250
Look at these.

534
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,289
All these tanks are full.

535
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:39,690
This game is awesome.

536
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,409
I love it.

537
00:48:40,409 --> 00:48:41,449
I knew I was going to get stuck.

538
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:57,210
The prices are crazy right now.

539
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:57,690
Come on.

540
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:58,250
Final month.

541
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,619
Everybody get over there now.

542
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:01,739
No more drilling.

543
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,619
And yeah, no more drilling.

544
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:03,019
Just sell.

545
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,630
Everybody just dump all your load over here.

546
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,550
More horses?

547
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:21,360
Put this down.

548
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,579
Hurry up.

549
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:24,860
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

550
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:45,949
Only like 10 days.

551
00:49:46,750 --> 00:50:11,150
$12,836.

552
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,190
That's how we get it done.

553
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,550
Oh, I lost 50 cents.

554
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:19,710
All right.

555
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,989
I got $1,000 in fines.

556
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:21,469
Who cares?

557
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:24,400
10 grand.

558
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,019
Did anybody?

559
00:50:27,019 --> 00:50:28,380
No one even came close.

560
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,139
I should get a prize for that.

561
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,440
Welcome to my bar.

562
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,960
Make yourself comfortable and mingle with the crowd.

563
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,320
They may have some interesting offers.

564
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,440
I like this game a lot.

565
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:41,369
Okay.

566
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,070
Kyle.

567
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,199
Tired of low prices.

568
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,840
Slip me some cash and the price of left ink will never go below 70 cents next year.

569
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,980
Okay.

570
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,639
At right ink, the price can be even more right.

571
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:06,400
For a small personal donation, a price will stay above 81 cents for the year.

572
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,440
That's not bad.

573
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:17,119
I can offer you a 50% discount on those hefty spilling fines for one year.

574
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:18,989
No.

575
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:19,789
How much is a fine?

576
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,239
I spilled 10 times or so and that's not worth it.

577
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:24,559
No.

578
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,050
Get out of here.

579
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:27,849
Although you can just...

580
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:31,760
Although you can fuck off.

581
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,079
All right.

582
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:39,179
More with three.

583
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:42,809
Double capacity.

584
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:46,269
I can have two.

585
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,199
Yeah, this is it for sure.

586
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:53,280
Yep.

587
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,139
This is it.

588
00:51:56,139 --> 00:51:58,760
I won't have that much money left though.

589
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,510
I think I'm going to do size two.

590
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,820
Size two makes sense to me.

591
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:18,250
I'm going up here.

592
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,559
Why do I get to go last every year?

593
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:25,000
That doesn't seem fair.

594
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,469
I have to go last every year?

595
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:33,130
I'm not bidding more money for that.

596
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,579
Upgrade the mole?

597
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,860
How do I upgrade the mole?

598
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:50,409
There's no mole two.

599
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:50,730
Is there?

600
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:54,409
I don't think there's a mole two.

601
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,320
All right.

602
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:58,639
Let's go.

603
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,400
I'm ready.

604
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,980
Click the button above the silo to upgrade the storage capacity of your silo against a small cost.

605
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,300
Okay.

606
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:12,750
From now on, levels will run from January 1st to December 31st.

607
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,750
I think there's no more oil left in the ground.

608
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,469
Click on the calendar and withdraw your land lease.

609
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,190
Oh, so if I don't...

610
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,789
If I go to the last month and I don't...

611
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:26,909
Well, there's nothing left?

612
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,150
I get some of the money back.

613
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:30,269
All right.

614
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:31,150
Let's go for it.

615
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:31,710
What do you want?

616
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:34,960
Oh, there's a Sims fast forward button.

617
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,289
Okay.

618
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:37,530
Cool.

619
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:46,440
Get this started right.

620
00:53:46,440 --> 00:54:02,750
Is that oil right there?

621
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:04,320
I can't tell.

622
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:04,800
Is that oil?

623
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:08,090
That looks like the edge, right?

624
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:10,800
Is that an edge?

625
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:20,650
Yes.

626
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:21,929
Right there.

627
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:22,170
All right.

628
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:22,409
We're good.

629
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:22,730
We're good.

630
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,289
Good start.

631
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:23,769
Good start.

632
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,719
Whoa!

633
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:37,280
Slippage.

634
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,340
Not slippage.

635
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,900
Spillage.

636
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:50,119
Oh, over here.

637
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

638
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,800
This way.

639
00:54:59,769 --> 00:55:26,320
Okay.

640
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,559
No.

641
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:26,800
Yeah.

642
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,570
This is expensive as shit.

643
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:51,710
Bring it over here.

644
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:51,949
Yeah.

645
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:52,429
No shit.

646
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:53,389
There's oil there.

647
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:58,300
All right.

648
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,059
I'm going to bring it back here.

649
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:00,300
Okay.

650
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,159
Start depositing it.

651
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:03,400
All right.

652
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,039
Stop bringing it right.

653
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:18,190
Okay.

654
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:20,250
How is there nothing over here?

655
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,250
I'm thinking this game sucks.

656
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:22,889
Play something else.

657
00:56:22,889 --> 00:56:23,449
No way, man.

658
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:23,929
This is great.

659
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:27,400
This game is no way, man.

660
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,719
Come on.

661
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,280
This is fun.

662
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,300
I think this is great.

663
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:34,750
Oh, shit.

664
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:34,989
All right.

665
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:35,309
We're good.

666
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,000
All right.

667
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,559
Hear me out.

668
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:42,840
I'm not going to go all the way down

669
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:46,030
because I'm afraid I'm going to go through something

670
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:46,750
and screw it up.

671
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,070
No, nothing there.

672
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,719
Is this still sucking from there?

673
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,400
Is it still getting it from there?

674
00:57:28,409 --> 00:57:29,849
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

675
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:30,889
Store it, store it, store it.

676
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:33,369
You do the big rush at the end when it's like $1.50.

677
00:57:33,369 --> 00:57:58,650
The mole's down here.

678
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,050
All right.

679
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,739
Let's start selling a little bit.

680
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:06,360
78 cents a spine.

681
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,079
There we go.

682
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:08,760
Here we go.

683
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,320
Perfect.

684
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:34,570
All right.

685
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,610
Let's go sell.

686
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:40,510
I'm going to be taking a ton.

687
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,949
I'm going to be making a lot of oil now.

688
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,280
Sell.

689
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:54,889
More horses.

690
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:55,289
I need more.

691
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:57,920
All right.

692
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,880
Let's go.

693
00:59:01,449 --> 00:59:03,289
It's literally $1.02 right now.

694
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:03,849
Speed it up.

695
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:04,409
Suck it out.

696
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:15,099
All right.

697
00:59:15,099 --> 00:59:15,820
I'm going to end.

698
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,579
I'm going to leave after this.

699
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,139
We just drained the whole thing.

700
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:20,380
All right.

701
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,179
I got $22,000.

702
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,210
Watch this.

703
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,500
I'm out.

704
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:25,820
I'm out.

705
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,539
I'm going to get a refund.

706
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:28,940
Upgrade the pipe.

707
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,340
Wait, what?

708
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:31,960
Wait, it's only August.

709
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,159
September, October, November.

710
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:33,719
It's not.

711
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:34,039
Okay.

712
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:34,440
Hold on.

713
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,010
There's no more juice on the ground, guys.

714
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,840
Is there some?

715
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,480
Wait, there's some here.

716
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,739
A little bit of extra at the bottom of the thing here.

717
00:59:46,460 --> 01:00:08,460
I'm out.

718
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:22,400
I'm out.

719
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,750
I'm out.

720
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:32,039
Good call.

721
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:33,630
It was a good call.

722
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:36,670
I just, there was one more over here.

723
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:36,989
That's fine.

724
01:00:36,989 --> 01:00:37,550
It's a good call.

725
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,630
I got my, I got literally, I got my money back.

726
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:39,949
Look at this.

727
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:43,320
Look at that.

728
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,840
It's literally 50% off.

729
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,280
It was a big one.

730
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,440
It was, it was decent medium size.

731
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,329
It was okay.

732
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:59,980
Okay.

733
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,780
Mayor's tips.

734
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:04,349
That's a big deal.

735
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,460
Four grand to make it so it's,

736
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,179
left ankle only be always 91 cents.

737
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,260
I'm going to build everything over on the left side.

738
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,849
Nothing's even going to go close to the right side.

739
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:23,820
Oh, that's not bad.

740
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:27,630
400 bucks for the slippage.

741
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,389
Why do I keep saying slippage?

742
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:32,679
Does the lower interest sound interesting?

743
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:36,199
Pay me some cash and I'll reduce next year's interest rates by 42%.

744
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,719
I got 30.

745
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:39,599
Geez.

746
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,800
I'm fine.

747
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,760
I'm going to do this one though.

748
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,389
91 cents permanently on the left side.

749
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:48,539
I think that's a good deal.

750
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:52,719
Mayor's tips.

751
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,309
One of 20 Daphne's deals.

752
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:09,230
Pipes don't have to reach the bottom of an oil patch.

753
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,829
Once connected, the oil pocket will be okay.

754
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,030
So that's good to know.

755
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:12,670
Thanks for the tip.

756
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,300
Oil is only pumped as fast as the narrowest pipe in a chain.

757
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,409
And handle.

758
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:23,530
Make sure all pipes in the chain are sufficiently upgraded for the most efficient oil flow.

759
01:02:24,489 --> 01:02:27,360
Okay.

760
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,400
If you don't see oil in uncovered ground below a waving dowser,

761
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,559
wait a while for the ground level to rise more.

762
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:47,820
You get more money for getting all the oil or selling all the oil

763
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,300
and withdrawing your land lease early.

764
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,489
Thank you mayor.

765
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:55,050
Appreciate it.

766
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:00,650
What else do I want to do?

767
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,719
Size three.

768
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,000
Timer two.

769
01:03:08,909 --> 01:03:09,469
Wide.

770
01:03:09,469 --> 01:03:10,030
Free wide.

771
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:16,269
Or more horses.

772
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,380
Mole sells two.

773
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,019
I'm begging you.

774
01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:28,809
Where?

775
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:30,489
Mole sells two.

776
01:03:30,489 --> 01:03:32,760
What's the moles?

777
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:34,269
Oh.

778
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:37,679
10 grand though.

779
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:38,079
All right.

780
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:38,639
I'll do it.

781
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:41,199
That's like the most money I wanted to spend in this entire time.

782
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:43,929
Moles dig faster.

783
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:47,579
I want horses.

784
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:54,909
Why did I just?

785
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:03,679
I don't have enough money.

786
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:18,119
I want this one.

787
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,989
Really?

788
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:21,949
You're going to outbid me?

789
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:25,400
You piece of shit.

790
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:29,039
How much is it going for?

791
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:29,599
Four grand?

792
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:32,030
Get out of my way.

793
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:38,440
You don't even have that much money.

794
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,380
Oh yeah you do.

795
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,019
Whatever fine.

796
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:42,059
Who cares?

797
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,940
I'm going over here.

798
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:56,440
Let's go.

799
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,760
Moles will now uncover nine cells instead of six.

800
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,400
I think they're probably better than the dowsers at this point right?

801
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,329
Let's get four going.

802
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,679
Who needs a dowser?

803
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,400
Left side only.

804
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:19,869
This is a huge one too.

805
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:23,480
Oh my god.

806
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:31,449
What a start.

807
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:32,969
What a start.

808
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:52,639
Right side?

809
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,519
No no no no no.

810
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:54,239
I'm not doing that.

811
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,530
Yes.

812
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,239
No.

813
01:06:11,449 --> 01:06:11,849
Right there.

814
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:38,440
There's nothing over here.

815
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:53,610
God damn it.

816
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:54,329
This is not enough.

817
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:55,610
Oh this is bad.

818
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,570
This is bad placement.

819
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:57,050
But whatever.

820
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:57,530
It's all right.

821
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:51,199
There's no oil on the on this side.

822
01:07:51,199 --> 01:08:12,269
All right we're in a good spot.

823
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:17,720
Speed it up.

824
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,100
Excuse me.

825
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:25,420
Take it.

826
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,300
Don't take it.

827
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:26,460
Go.

828
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,659
What are you doing over there?

829
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:47,000
Look at that.

830
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,699
Look at that money coming in.

831
01:08:48,699 --> 01:09:05,449
30 grand.

832
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:06,810
Oh let's go.

833
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:26,270
All right I need down here.

834
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:51,470
See where you see something.

835
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:52,430
What do you see?

836
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,149
You see something?

837
01:09:53,149 --> 01:10:27,079
A dollar thirty nine.

838
01:10:27,079 --> 01:10:27,640
Look at that.

839
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:28,199
Come on.

840
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:28,520
Come on.

841
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:28,840
Come on.

842
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,039
I need to make more money.

843
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,390
A dollar fifty per pound or whatever it is.

844
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:42,800
Come on.

845
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,920
This is so much.

846
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,560
Is there no more oil left in this goddamn place?

847
01:10:48,560 --> 01:11:01,710
I think this place is dry.

848
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:08,720
I think it's dry.

849
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,520
I think I got everything.

850
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:10,920
It's dry.

851
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,180
Let me check one a few more places.

852
01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:21,390
I think it's dry.

853
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:32,840
I'm pulling up.

854
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,600
Got it all.

855
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,029
Thousand for bonus early withdrawal.

856
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,149
Thousand for all oil.

857
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:45,479
Thousand for all oil sold.

858
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:46,199
Bingo.

859
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:50,220
Did it.

860
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:55,500
Feels good.

861
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:59,319
Okay.

862
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,260
I got money to play with now.

863
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:04,619
What should I do?

864
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,529
I think it's stable right?

865
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,010
Yeah so I can buy less horses makes sense to me.

866
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:18,590
So the horses can just take more.

867
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:21,949
And I want them to be faster.

868
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:26,960
That's twenty five thousand dollars.

869
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,279
I'm done.

870
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:37,960
Left is eighty nine ninety cents or I I don't get out of bed for anything less than ninety cents.

871
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:47,020
Sorry not worth it.

872
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:52,920
Okay let's keep going.

873
01:12:58,439 --> 01:12:59,239
Thirty four.

874
01:12:59,239 --> 01:12:59,960
That's not bad.

875
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,399
You know to fight all the people over here.

876
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:12,250
It looks like the trend is up here is more.

877
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,680
Let's go higher.

878
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:18,479
The higher you go seems like the more there is.

879
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,560
The green on this guy is crazy.

880
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,199
I'm green?

881
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,710
Am I actually like green?

882
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:28,670
Like my skin is green?

883
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,109
What do you mean?

884
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:30,430
Is it?

885
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:36,479
Shouldn't be.

886
01:13:41,229 --> 01:13:42,350
All right let's move.

887
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:47,399
From now on you can upgrade your wagons to carry more oil.

888
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:48,760
You can buy it by clicking it here.

889
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:51,720
Remember this upgrade only lasts for the duration of the level.

890
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:54,270
Oh okay well.

891
01:13:56,039 --> 01:13:57,479
Let's get our mole crew out here.

892
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:10,569
Nice job.

893
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,800
Nice job.

894
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:32,750
Good work.

895
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,630
You guys see anything else?

896
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:35,869
I think we're good right?

897
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:52,279
Don't sell left.

898
01:14:52,279 --> 01:15:16,680
Well now I'm kind of hold on.

899
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,479
No more right here.

900
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,520
Okay we're getting right in the middle.

901
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,119
Looks like we got two.

902
01:15:20,119 --> 01:15:40,840
Wagging capacity hurry up.

903
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,680
Come on come on hurry up hurry up.

904
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,760
Oh boy hold on.

905
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,199
All right speed is now a thousand bucks okay.

906
01:15:50,199 --> 01:16:05,930
All right now we're going to start to make a ton of money here.

907
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,810
They can feel way.

908
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:14,800
Wait what are they doing?

909
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:15,920
Deliver it.

910
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:31,609
All right do not go that way.

911
01:16:31,609 --> 01:16:33,399
Don't go that way either.

912
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:52,600
39 cents give me a break.

913
01:16:52,600 --> 01:17:28,960
Right when I send all of you guys over here.

914
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,359
It's it's 80 cents on the right side now.

915
01:17:31,359 --> 01:18:05,710
Yeah everybody start going here now.

916
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:08,189
Right there all right good good good good good good good.

917
01:18:08,189 --> 01:18:10,279
That's a lot.

918
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:20,680
I'm going I'm gonna double drain that one.

919
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,199
Oh my god it's all a 37.

920
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:33,720
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

921
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,079
Oh shit I didn't even see it.

922
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:48,159
All right we're going to go full throttle here.

923
01:18:48,159 --> 01:19:04,270
Everybody deposit.

924
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:07,720
Now hold hold it.

925
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,520
Let's sell to the left a little bit here.

926
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,449
Start selling left.

927
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:16,250

Let it climb let it climb.

936
01:19:31,289 --> 01:19:32,569
Let it climb to like a dollar.

937
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:38,960
It's over a dollar.

938
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,470
Okay hold on and sell right.

01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:45,069

I think it's dry.

943
01:19:52,939 --> 01:20:00,479
I'm pretty sure this is dry.

944
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:22,380
Shit it's all right I'll take 30 grand.

945
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:33,079
It was good it was close.

946
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:36,199
All right what about um herd size.

947
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,119
Or no no I'll do the mole thing right.

948
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:39,239
People said do moles.

949
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:40,359
Sells three.

950
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:44,090
Moles will now uncover 12 cells instead of nine.

951
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:48,250
It's 20 grand.

952
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,850
Moles will dig faster.

953
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:53,130
I just spent 30 000 on moles.

954
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:57,130
They dig faster and they do way more.

955
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,159
Hope this is worth it.

956
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:00,840
I only have six thousand dollars left.

957
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:09,199
Wait anybody have anything?

958
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,729
No 100% discount.

959
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:13,609
Loans now.

960
01:21:13,609 --> 01:21:14,649
Okay let's go.

961
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:20,039
Only four more places to go.

962
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:25,100
Stay right here.

963
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:31,449
This is it for this area.

964
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:34,859
Are we ready to go?

965
01:21:34,859 --> 01:21:37,050
I gotta make money.

966
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:39,149
All right mole strats.

967
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:43,050
That's very good.

968
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,569
And they dig faster now too.

969
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:51,439
Okay let's get started.

970
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:52,720
Go my minions.

971
01:21:52,720 --> 01:22:00,439
Good job.

972
01:22:00,439 --> 01:22:02,220
This one right here.

973
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:12,270
Is this just a huge one?

974
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,430
Okay I'm gonna do.

975
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,939
You might think I'm crazy but I'm doing too.

976
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:34,239
All right stop stop stop.

977
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:37,880
Left side left side left side.

978
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:56,029
This one is just gigantic.

979
01:22:56,029 --> 01:22:57,470
This is this big.

980
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,359
Got one here.

981
01:22:59,359 --> 01:23:04,170
That's a long way to go.

982
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:30,300
Oh shit there's some right here.

983
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,260
I didn't even see it.

984
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,779
I'll get it.

985
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:37,069
I'll get it don't worry.

986
01:23:37,069 --> 01:23:38,510
Nothing on the right side at all.

987
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:47,310
Wait I can connect them?

988
01:23:47,310 --> 01:24:05,640
Did I not do this?

989
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,039
Uh oh.

990
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:11,720
Oh I need to sell it.

991
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:50,250
Oh hurry up.

992
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:54,649
Stop that bullshit.

993
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:56,760
I can't move these anymore.

994
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:06,670
Oh come the fuck on dude.

995
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:09,760
What do I do about this?

996
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,920
There's too much money to be made on the right side.

997
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:20,119
I can't store it yet.

998
01:25:20,119 --> 01:25:21,079
What the hell?

999
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:25,529
Can I close this?

1000
01:25:25,529 --> 01:25:26,649
Close one rig.

1001
01:25:26,649 --> 01:25:36,189
What do I?

1002
01:25:36,189 --> 01:25:48,680
How do I do this?

1003
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,060
You can't.

1004
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:50,859
I can't.

1005
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:51,579
I guess you can't.

1006
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:59,199
Oh really?

1007
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:05,279
Oh I think I'm all right.

1008
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:06,079
I'm okay.

1009
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,079
Let's start storing oil.

1010
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:17,210
I think I'm all right.

1011
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:24,569
Store store store store store.

1012
01:26:24,569 --> 01:26:33,680
Or go go left go left.

1013
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:35,439
I gotta come back up and get this.

1014
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:42,189
Dude this land sucks.

1015
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:43,470
It's not my problem.

1016
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:44,909
This land is terrible.

1017
01:26:44,909 --> 01:26:46,909
I got the worst land in the game so far.

1018
01:26:46,909 --> 01:27:10,439
You're gonna think I'm insane but I'm not.

1019
01:27:10,439 --> 01:27:30,409
All right store it.

1020
01:27:30,409 --> 01:27:31,770
Bottom left too yep.

1021
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:36,409
This land is terrible.

1022
01:27:36,409 --> 01:27:42,239
I'm gonna have to go from here that way.

1023
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:49,630
It's so long but it's gonna be the same length.

1024
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:50,430
Do not sell.

1025
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:55,100
These are dog shit prices.

1026
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,699
Don't sell these are dog shit prices.

1027
01:27:56,699 --> 01:27:57,500
I refuse.

1028
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:13,180
Don't sell.

1029
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:18,619
We're gonna do a huge sell at the end.

1030
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:31,930
All right I'm gonna keep going this way.

1031
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:33,130
63 cents.

1032
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:44,119
69 cents.

1033
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:45,399
Oh everybody hold hold hold hold.

1034
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:46,520
Don't move don't move.

1035
01:28:46,520 --> 01:29:02,680
Oh 84 cents.

1036
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,479
85 cents.

1037
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:04,359
87 cents.

1038
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:05,640
88 cents.

1039
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,520
89 cents.

1040
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,489
Get the horses ready.

1041
01:29:08,489 --> 01:29:09,850
Get the horses ready.

1042
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:16,960
Once this goes over a dollar I'm going in.

1043
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,920
And it's time not yet.

1044
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:56,029
Okay the run is saved.

1045
01:29:56,029 --> 01:30:03,369
135 on the left too.

1046
01:30:03,369 --> 01:30:04,649
All right we're good we're good we're good.

1047
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:22,510
Let's go.

1048
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:31,079
What year is it?

1049
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:32,119
Stop selling.

1050
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:35,369
Store it.

1051
01:30:35,369 --> 01:30:47,930
I think that might be it.

1052
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:53,819
Another couple of uh I think this is it.

1053
01:30:53,819 --> 01:30:54,619
120 cents.

1054
01:30:54,619 --> 01:30:55,579
I'm not doing that.

1055
01:30:55,579 --> 01:31:00,350
I think we're dry.

1056
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:03,119
Just hold on a second.

1057
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:07,340
50 cents.

1058
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,140
I gotta sell.

1059
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:17,359
Oh I don't care.

1060
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:18,159
Final month is fine.

1061
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,119
I'll make more money.

1062
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:21,119
Hold hold hold don't no no no no no no.

1063
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:21,920
The price is climbing.

1064
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:27,630
Don't do that.

1065
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:28,350
I'll make more money.

1066
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:52,399
I'll make more money.

1067
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:54,159
Five grand that was bad.

1068
01:31:54,159 --> 01:32:04,079
Okay if you can see a diamond you need a mold to get it above ground.

1069
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:05,840
I can teach them this valuable skill.

1070
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:11,100
Don't feel like going around rocks then go straight through them with the special drill

1071
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,779
I'm offering at my factory.

1072
01:32:12,779 --> 01:32:16,510
Our need for oil brings us to the desert.

1073
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:22,520
Here you can stumble upon rocks and diamonds in the ground.

1074
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,159
All right.

1075
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:27,399
Diamond hunting moles.

1076
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:30,729
That's pretty cool.

1077
01:32:31,289 --> 01:32:32,409
I can work with that.

1078
01:32:32,409 --> 01:32:39,260
Anthony might be in the saloon to help you out in exchange for a diamond.

1079
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,899
He'll point out an oil rich parcel to you.

1080
01:32:44,039 --> 01:32:44,840
Really?

1081
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:51,359
What do you guys think?

1082
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:52,239
I'm thinking right.

1083
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,920
I'm thinking all the way to the bottom right.

1084
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,579
Yeah the top right or bottom right I think is what I'm gonna do.

1085
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:06,239
Right in the mid?

1086
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,270
Should ask the guy.

1087
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:09,359
Well I need a diamond.

1088
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:10,479
I don't have a diamond.

1089
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,720
I'm going right here.

1090
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:18,329
Hope it was worth it.

1091
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,210
All right I got some money.

1092
01:33:22,039 --> 01:33:24,039
Moles will dig even faster.

1093
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:26,329
I can have a scanner.

1094
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:30,329
If you want to know exactly what sits where under the surface use the scanner.

1095
01:33:30,329 --> 01:33:32,840
That sounds really good.

1096
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,680
Diamonds.

1097
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:39,020
I can train moles so they dig up diamonds.

1098
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:42,539
It's expensive.

1099
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,609
Left will never be 81.

1100
01:33:57,050 --> 01:33:58,250
Always over 70.

1101
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:58,810
That's bad.

1102
01:33:59,689 --> 01:34:03,659
It's also bad.

1103
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:05,500
I thought it was 20 bucks.

1104
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,380
I was like wait hold on.

1105
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:07,979
All right factory.

1106
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:11,550
The drill.

1107
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,979
Found a new drilling method which allows you to drill through rocks.

1108
01:34:15,979 --> 01:34:16,460
Uh oh.

1109
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,399
That's not good.

1110
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:25,520
Well I hope they find some diamonds.

1111
01:34:27,229 --> 01:34:29,069
This is a long stream for you Jerma.

1112
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:31,630
I told you we were doing game gamer weekend.

1113
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:34,350
I'm I don't want to leave.

1114
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,229
I'm having a great time.

1115
01:34:35,229 --> 01:34:36,029
I want I'm gonna stay.

1116
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:38,090
I'll stay for a while.

1117
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:41,039
That's why I started early.

1118
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:43,789
This game's I love this game.

1119
01:34:43,789 --> 01:34:45,390
Should I beat this game like right now?

1120
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:49,369
Should I go eat food come back and just and just beat this game?

1121
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:57,640
Put a mold directly on it if you find a diamond.

1122
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,920
All right well get to work guys.

1123
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,079
Mole friends.

1124
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:12,750
That's rock.

1125
01:35:16,329 --> 01:35:31,470
I'm concerned about this because I can't drill through that.

1126
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:52,859
Okay there's no I think I'm all right.

1127
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:53,739
70 a dollar.

1128
01:35:53,739 --> 01:35:54,779
All right let's go.

1129
01:35:54,779 --> 01:36:10,270
Change sides.

1130
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:10,989
All right stop.

1131
01:36:10,989 --> 01:36:14,489
Store it.

1132
01:36:14,489 --> 01:36:18,029
Now I'm gonna go here.

1133
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:20,649
Here.

1134
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:25,159
Slowly kind of make my way down.

1135
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:29,340
Double this up.

1136
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,140
Another horse.

1137
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:31,979
I need more horses right now.

1138
01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:35,520
71 cents it's all right.

1139
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,239
It's gonna it's not ideal but I'm gonna do it.

1140
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:40,300
I need the money.

1141
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,460
Okay store it.

1142
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,979
I need more horses.

1143
01:36:43,979 --> 01:36:50,079
What's the point of the game?

1144
01:36:50,079 --> 01:37:10,409
Make a bunch of money and become an oil tycoon.

1145
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:12,250
All right start selling left side.

1146
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:23,869
Some more mole action.

1147
01:37:23,869 --> 01:37:34,840
I just don't want to hit rock.

1148
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,800
It might break it.

1149
01:37:35,800 --> 01:38:05,149
This is a big one right here.

1150
01:38:05,149 --> 01:38:10,399
Oh all right start storing it.

1151
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:12,000
Do I can I drill around this?

1152
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:21,500
How do I get around this?

1153
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:26,239
Or can I not?

1154
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,439
I don't I think that goes all the way.

1155
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:44,279
I think I have to go right.

1156
01:38:44,279 --> 01:38:45,479
Shit I gotta get down here.

1157
01:38:45,479 --> 01:38:49,840
This better not go all the way around.

1158
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,470
So much shit over here.

1159
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:54,829
All right 92 cents right side.

1160
01:38:54,829 --> 01:39:09,020
Start selling it.

1161
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:20,670
Whoa stop go the other way.

1162
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:21,710
Actually perfect.

1163
01:39:21,710 --> 01:39:25,500
All right we're good.

1164
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,779
Now I can slow down a little.

1165
01:39:26,779 --> 01:39:28,300
Because I need to get around here.

1166
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,550
Question is where do I want to go from here?

1167
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:38,359
There's no rock here right?

1168
01:39:38,359 --> 01:39:51,579
There might not be anything else over here.

1169
01:39:51,579 --> 01:39:59,050
I'll dig.

1170
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,569
I don't want to spend too much money digging down.

1171
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:01,899
There's nothing there.

1172
01:40:01,899 --> 01:40:03,020
I could go this way.

1173
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:25,229
I think this is stuck.

1174
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:41,770
Spending money to dig a hole to make money.

1175
01:40:44,859 --> 01:40:46,140
I mean kind of.

1176
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:55,789
I'm literally getting this game right now.

1177
01:40:55,789 --> 01:40:57,920
This is addicting.

1178
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,119
It really is.

1179
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,000
It just is.

1180
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
It's great.

1181
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,460
Not too complicated.

1182
01:41:08,460 --> 01:41:10,989
It's just kind of you gotta make you gotta be.

1183
01:41:10,989 --> 01:41:12,270
It's just some RNG right?

1184
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:13,869
You gotta find the thing to dig into.

1185
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:20,510
I don't I click oh.

1186
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:24,479
All right I'm gonna go from.

1187
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:30,199
What does that mean?

1188
01:41:30,199 --> 01:41:38,970
What does this mean though?

1189
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:40,810
Why close and open?

1190
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:45,550
Is it to divert or something?

1191
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:47,710
I don't want to make another one just for a tiny little thing.

1192
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,479
How much is it gonna cost to get over there?

1193
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:51,399
$278.

1194
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:54,159
It might cost the same amount of money.

1195
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:57,819
To just build one.

1196
01:41:57,819 --> 01:42:17,479
Caught it on the way down but it's all right.

1197
01:42:17,479 --> 01:42:18,279
Left side.

1198
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:39,609
Branch from second node on the middle well.

1199
01:42:39,609 --> 01:42:43,039
Uh I don't I don't have um I didn't upgrade that.

1200
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:51,520
This might actually be it.

1201
01:42:51,520 --> 01:43:01,760
That was it.

1202
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:06,960
That was a terrible plot.

1203
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,409
That was such a bad plot.

1204
01:43:12,409 --> 01:43:13,949
The rocks all over the place.

1205
01:43:13,949 --> 01:43:14,670
Who picked that?

1206
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:24,439
Okay that is the worst plot in the entire game.

1207
01:43:24,439 --> 01:43:27,689
In the entire two hours we've been playing this.

1208
01:43:27,689 --> 01:43:29,340
24.

1209
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:31,979
Even the tutorial zone had more.

1210
01:43:31,979 --> 01:43:41,439
Do I want to upgrade anything?

1211
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:47,310
77 cents.

1212
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:55,319
Save for the drill.

1213
01:43:55,319 --> 01:44:05,149
Yeah I don't even use the dowsers.

1214
01:44:05,149 --> 01:44:06,560
They're too slow.

1215
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:12,890
All right yeah I can't spend any money.

1216
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:14,010
That was a bad one.

1217
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:16,029
All right where?

1218
01:44:16,029 --> 01:44:17,560
What do you think?

1219
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:21,789
I don't want you to see my like yellow stained armpits.

1220
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:23,229
So I'm gonna move over this way.

1221
01:44:23,229 --> 01:44:28,989
I still like work out in this shirt.

1222
01:44:28,989 --> 01:44:32,039
If anyone's figuring that out.

1223
01:44:32,039 --> 01:44:33,770
Pop left.

1224
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:44,880
Good.

1225
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,920
We all picked one.

1226
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,199
Okay hopefully mine was right.

1227
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:48,159
This could be huge.

1228
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:52,039
This could change the rest of the course of the entire game.

1229
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:58,810
I gotta play efficiently.

1230
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:17,840
Not bad.

1231
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:38,079
Stupid you're an idiot.

1232
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:38,960
Why did I do that?

1233
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:50,079
Sell right.

1234
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:58,840
Sell right.

1235
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,479
Keep going.

1236
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:00,199
Keep selling right.

1237
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:11,850
Left side.

1238
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:14,720
All right it's still pretty good.

1239
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,970
Let's start putting this together.

1240
01:46:16,970 --> 01:46:21,579
I hope there's no rocks here.

1241
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:22,380
That would be bad.

1242
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:37,479
All right it's gonna start flowing pretty hard now.

1243
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:45,979
Oh my goodness.

1244
01:46:45,979 --> 01:47:01,800
I need some more horses right now.

1245
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,680
Not prepared.

1246
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,960
I wasn't prepared.

1247
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:10,220
I'm not getting a fee every time this happens right.

1248
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,140
Why are you storing it?

1249
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:14,939
Oh my god what a disaster.

1250
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:26,590
What a disaster.

1251
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:44,170
There we go.

1252
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:44,970
This is huge.

1253
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:45,850
I'm going this way.

1254
01:47:45,850 --> 01:48:20,680
A monumentally huge one.

1255
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,479
Oh shit.

1256
01:48:21,479 --> 01:48:22,359
Okay there's more.

1257
01:48:22,359 --> 01:48:41,069
Connect these two.

1258
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:43,710
All right this is looking pretty good.

1259
01:48:43,710 --> 01:48:44,829
Count some money over this say.

1260
01:48:44,829 --> 01:48:45,789
Hold on the left side.

1261
01:48:45,789 --> 01:48:50,590
It's a mole action.

1262
01:48:50,590 --> 01:49:02,600
Still over a dollar.

1263
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,279
A dollar seven still over on left side.

1264
01:49:04,279 --> 01:49:16,670
Okay that's better.

1265
01:49:16,670 --> 01:49:17,470
I wonder if I should.

1266
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:18,510
Okay there we go.

1267
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,149
Right here.

1268
01:49:19,149 --> 01:49:37,279
All right I'm gonna stop selling here.

1269
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:38,399
All right stop selling.

1270
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:46,159
You go to the right side.

1271
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,199
There's more over this way.

1272
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:48,640
I might connect these two together.

1273
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:58,439
Start selling right side.

1274
01:49:58,439 --> 01:50:16,680
All back on the right side after this batch.

1275
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,399
Back to depositing.

1276
01:50:17,399 --> 01:50:18,760
We're gonna wait till it's over a dollar

1277
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,720
and then we're gonna go for it.

1278
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:32,300
We're gonna go super mode.

1279
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:39,079
Oops.

1280
01:50:39,079 --> 01:50:50,119
All right start selling.

1281
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:50,760
Uh oh.

1282
01:50:50,760 --> 01:51:09,529
We're just gonna do drain it from three.

1283
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:15,260
Uh oh.

1284
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:16,539
All right I need more selling.

1285
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:28,520
I need any more room.

1286
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:30,680
Not an ideal price but it's not a bad one either.

1287
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:49,869
Oil patch for our left.

1288
01:51:49,869 --> 01:51:51,149
I got it going for it.

1289
01:51:51,149 --> 01:51:58,220
I'm okay with 84 cents.

1290
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:58,699
That's good.

1291
01:51:58,699 --> 01:52:05,369
September.

1292
01:52:05,369 --> 01:52:07,210
Unless let's is there anything down here?

1293
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:15,529
Just if there's something down there

1294
01:52:15,529 --> 01:52:16,090
then you know what I mean.

1295
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:20,800
We gotta be careful.

1296
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:21,520
Now this is it.

1297
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:22,720
Is it just this here

1298
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,479
and then I gotta wrap back around and get this.

1299
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:28,670
All right start storing it.

1300
01:52:28,670 --> 01:52:32,079
All right this one's almost drained completely.

1301
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:37,819
I'm going.

1302
01:52:37,819 --> 01:52:39,520
I know I'm an idiot but whatever.

1303
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,079
I need it.

1304
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:41,520
I want the thousand dollar bonus.

1305
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:53,130
Shit this one below it too.

1306
01:52:53,130 --> 01:52:54,890
Oh come on really.

1307
01:52:54,890 --> 01:53:34,079
There's nothing else over here.

1308
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:36,960
700 dollars to get a bonus of a thousand.

1309
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:53,369
I think that's it.

1310
01:53:53,369 --> 01:54:02,489
This looks like shit but whatever.

1311
01:54:02,489 --> 01:54:03,609
All right get it.

1312
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:06,329
Hurry up.

1313
01:54:06,329 --> 01:54:06,810
Suck it up.

1314
01:54:06,810 --> 01:54:07,130
Suck it up.

1315
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:07,449
Suck it up.

1316
01:54:07,449 --> 01:54:07,850
Suck it up.

1317
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:08,649
Quick quick quick quick.

1318
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:11,840
Did I get it?

1319
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:33,289
What should I do?

1320
01:54:33,289 --> 01:54:35,600
The rock drill is really important.

1321
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:42,319
You know where's that factory?

1322
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:43,359
30,000.

1323
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:45,310
You found a new drill method

1324
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:47,229
which allows you to drill through rock.

1325
01:54:47,229 --> 01:54:49,819
Yes and that's all I'm going to do for now.

1326
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:51,819
Anything cheap.

1327
01:54:56,569 --> 01:54:57,689
Sure I'll get it just to get it.

1328
01:54:57,689 --> 01:54:58,649
Why not?

1329
01:54:58,649 --> 01:55:03,789
Okay I can go through a rock now.

1330
01:55:03,789 --> 01:55:04,909
Oh the branch.

1331
01:55:05,710 --> 01:55:06,670
Oh all right.

1332
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:09,399
Okay remind me to do that next time

1333
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:11,319
because I can't just not do that.

1334
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:15,390
That one was really good.

1335
01:55:15,390 --> 01:55:17,050
It was like 40 grand.

1336
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:19,359
I'm staying up here.

1337
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:21,529
Probably right here right?

1338
01:55:21,529 --> 01:55:23,210
This is 48, 54.

1339
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:25,850
This has to be at least like 50

1340
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:28,600
or probably up here all the way to the top.

1341
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,760
Let's try this one.

1342
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:35,789
Outbid huh?

1343
01:55:35,789 --> 01:55:36,829
Fine I'll just outbid you.

1344
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:40,439
Really?

1345
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:41,640
Fine I'll just outbid you.

1346
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:46,350
Stop.

1347
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:50,989
Who has more money?

1348
01:55:57,819 --> 01:55:59,100
I'm not going higher than 6k.

1349
01:56:03,470 --> 01:56:06,479
What are you guys doing?

1350
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:17,800
What are you doing?

1351
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,680
He scammed me.

1352
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,800
He did it on purpose.

1353
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,000
Okay what did I just do?

1354
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,880
10,000?

1355
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:26,119
Okay I'm in trouble.

1356
01:56:26,119 --> 01:56:30,039
Because it costs 2,000.

1357
01:56:30,039 --> 01:56:31,000
No I'm all right.

1358
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,649
And I got the drill too.

1359
01:56:32,649 --> 01:56:33,449
All right we're good.

1360
01:56:33,449 --> 01:56:34,090
I'm just gonna get...

1361
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:35,449
These moles gotta do work right now.

1362
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:38,170
Put them strategically.

1363
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:42,140
Okay let the moles do their thing.

1364
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:49,659
Good job.

1365
01:56:49,659 --> 01:56:50,300
Nice work.

1366
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:51,100
Excellent work over there.

1367
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,890
Let's get started right now.

1368
01:56:52,890 --> 01:56:54,890
Wait this is gonna get us some...

1369
01:56:54,890 --> 01:56:57,609
Yep.

1370
01:56:57,609 --> 01:56:58,649
Wait you have to upgrade it.

1371
01:57:02,079 --> 01:57:02,720
I have to.

1372
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,680
It's 750.

1373
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:04,960
Okay all right all right.

1374
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:07,819
Let's get this started right now

1375
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:10,539
and we got some good good good good.

1376
01:57:10,539 --> 01:57:13,390
Okay very good very good very good.

1377
01:57:13,390 --> 01:57:15,180
I'm gonna go here.

1378
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:17,979
Right here.

1379
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:20,880
Right there.

1380
01:57:21,439 --> 01:57:23,979
A couple of horses.

1381
01:57:23,979 --> 01:57:24,539
I'm gonna do...

1382
01:57:24,539 --> 01:57:29,789
I'm gonna sell on the one-in-one.

1383
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:32,560
I don't want...

1384
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,920
Don't upgrade this shit yet

1385
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:34,880
until I can handle it.

1386
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,159
I do this every single time.

1387
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:59,770
Start storing it.

1388
01:57:59,770 --> 01:58:02,590
I'm now prepared to upgrade these.

1389
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:05,449
I'm gonna go with the second drill here.

1390
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:31,800
No it didn't spill.

1391
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:32,760
That's such horse shit.

1392
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:47,210
Can we go this way?

1393
01:58:47,210 --> 01:59:24,489
I was scared that I wasn't gonna make it through this.

1394
01:59:24,489 --> 01:59:26,010
I thought there was gonna be a wall here.

1395
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:29,119
All right we're good.

1396
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:47,229
You don't have it?

1397
01:59:47,229 --> 01:59:48,109
I thought you did.

1398
01:59:48,109 --> 01:59:49,159
You do now.

1399
01:59:49,159 --> 02:00:12,039
All right store.

1400
02:00:12,039 --> 02:00:15,239
This is where we're gonna start to make tons of money.

1401
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:28,329
I paid 10 grand for this spot.

1402
02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:29,609
There better be more than this.

1403
02:00:29,609 --> 02:00:31,359
It's a joke.

1404
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:55,369
What's happening?

1405
02:00:55,369 --> 02:01:03,899
I was too lasered in.

1406
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:09,119
I was lasered in to just that spot right there.

1407
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:09,920
And I wasn't paying...

1408
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,720
I'm in trouble.

1409
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:17,630
This is bad.

1410
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:18,989
So quick.

1411
02:01:18,989 --> 02:01:31,369
Everything's fine.

1412
02:01:31,369 --> 02:01:54,010
What a trash fucking place to do this in.

1413
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:55,449
What a garbage place.

1414
02:01:56,409 --> 02:02:03,210
I paid $10,000 for the amount of oil that would fit in a Capri Sun.

1415
02:02:03,210 --> 02:02:21,949
Are you kidding me?

1416
02:02:21,949 --> 02:02:23,069
See anything over there?

1417
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:28,939
We're at a standstill.

1418
02:02:28,939 --> 02:02:30,060
I think I got everything.

1419
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:39,930
There's no oil to get anymore.

1420
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:40,810
There's no more oil.

1421
02:02:40,810 --> 02:02:47,039
I paid $10,000 for this place.

1422
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:56,000
There's one snot rocket down here.

1423
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:56,479
Great.

1424
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:14,109
This guy hasn't found shit.

1425
02:03:14,109 --> 02:03:15,390
Unleash the moles?

1426
02:03:15,390 --> 02:03:29,479
All right unleash the moles I guess.

1427
02:03:29,479 --> 02:03:30,039
You got something?

1428
02:03:30,039 --> 02:03:30,840
You found something.

1429
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:31,640
Oh my god.

1430
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:32,359
Okay dude.

1431
02:03:32,359 --> 02:03:32,920
Fine.

1432
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:39,260
That's it.

1433
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:49,880
Store it.

1434
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:54,760
Do I just go over here?

1435
02:03:54,760 --> 02:04:08,920
November.

1436
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,779
What happened over here?

1437
02:04:10,779 --> 02:04:16,380
That shit just crashed to five cents.

1438
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:17,020
All right.

1439
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:17,899
Start selling.

1440
02:04:17,899 --> 02:04:23,560
Go.

1441
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,439
$30,000.

1442
02:04:24,439 --> 02:04:25,560
Did I get it all?

1443
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:26,359
All right.

1444
02:04:26,359 --> 02:04:27,079
I think that's empty.

1445
02:04:27,079 --> 02:04:27,720
Let's see.

1446
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,850
I think I got everything.

1447
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:35,279
That was not worth $10,000.

1448
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:38,270
It was empty over here.

1449
02:04:38,270 --> 02:04:42,250
I mean oh my god.

1450
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:43,609
$10,000 for the land.

1451
02:04:43,609 --> 02:04:46,970
$7,000 for you know just do the math.

1452
02:04:46,970 --> 02:04:55,869
Down $17,000.

1453
02:04:55,869 --> 02:04:59,159
I want to see that.

1454
02:04:59,159 --> 02:04:59,880
$45,000.

1455
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,840
I guess that was okay.

1456
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:07,149
Not worth $10,000.

1457
02:05:07,149 --> 02:05:08,720
Sleepy talking?

1458
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:10,640
No it's just headphone talking.

1459
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:12,699
Just speech jams me.

1460
02:05:12,699 --> 02:05:13,260
All right.

1461
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:14,380
Branch time.

1462
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:20,560
So I can go.

1463
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,399
I can split pipes.

1464
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:23,039
There we go.

1465
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:23,840
I got it.

1466
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,189
Let's go for it.

1467
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:31,979
I mean very obviously it's up here.

1468
02:05:31,979 --> 02:05:34,859
But there's no way I'm going to.

1469
02:05:34,859 --> 02:05:46,699
I actually can't spend more than like a few thousand on this.

1470
02:05:46,699 --> 02:05:48,680
I'm not going higher than that.

1471
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:49,239
No.

1472
02:05:49,239 --> 02:05:49,880
Fuck you.

1473
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:50,439
I'll go here.

1474
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:54,000
Enjoy it.

1475
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,399
Enjoy.

1476
02:05:54,399 --> 02:05:55,840
Hey enjoy your Capri Sun.

1477
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,600
Because that's literally what you're going to get there.

1478
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:08,840
Is that three pipes?

1479
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:18,880
I kind of went overboard with the moles.

1480
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:31,000
Okay well this is a big one.

1481
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:58,460
Fuck.

1482
02:06:58,539 --> 02:06:59,500
Did it wrong.

1483
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:22,460
Wait I could do this right?

1484
02:07:22,460 --> 02:07:23,579
Okay yeah I can do that.

1485
02:07:23,579 --> 02:07:30,270
Make some money.

1486
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:30,829
Let's go.

1487
02:07:30,829 --> 02:07:36,329
No no no no no.

1488
02:07:36,329 --> 02:07:36,810
How do I stop?

1489
02:07:36,810 --> 02:07:37,850
So oh no we're good.

1490
02:07:37,850 --> 02:07:49,689
Okay this is not bad.

1491
02:07:49,689 --> 02:07:57,279
Very nice.

1492
02:07:57,279 --> 02:07:57,600
All right.

1493
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:58,880
So this is just going to drain.

1494
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,939
Get some mole action.

1495
02:08:00,939 --> 02:08:22,670
Got something on the right here.

1496
02:08:22,670 --> 02:08:24,430
Silo going right in the middle.

1497
02:08:24,430 --> 02:08:25,710
Directly in the middle.

1498
02:08:25,710 --> 02:08:29,069
Another one right here.

1499
02:08:29,069 --> 02:08:32,810
Okay when this one's done we're going to go down.

1500
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:33,210
I might.

1501
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:37,710
Should I do two here?

1502
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:38,670
I'm going to store it.

1503
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:39,470
That's too far to go.

1504
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:40,350
I'm going to spill.

1505
02:08:40,350 --> 02:09:00,220
Maybe I won't.

1506
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:02,439
I knew I was going to spill.

1507
02:09:02,439 --> 02:09:03,479
Don't do it.

1508
02:09:03,479 --> 02:09:11,130
Got it.

1509
02:09:11,130 --> 02:09:13,420
Okay we're good.

1510
02:09:13,420 --> 02:09:16,619
Now close the pipe.

1511
02:09:16,619 --> 02:09:17,180
Who closed it?

1512
02:09:17,180 --> 02:09:17,659
What?

1513
02:09:17,659 --> 02:09:19,979
What are you talking about?

1514
02:09:19,979 --> 02:09:20,699
What do you want?

1515
02:09:20,699 --> 02:09:22,270
Close the valve.

1516
02:09:22,270 --> 02:09:22,750
Don't.

1517
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:23,470
What do you mean close it?

1518
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:28,510
What do you want me to do?

1519
02:09:28,510 --> 02:09:29,949
Oh that's.

1520
02:09:29,949 --> 02:09:31,390
I can just do it right here.

1521
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:33,039
I understand what that means now.

1522
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:39,739
Okay okay we got a big one here.

1523
02:09:39,739 --> 02:09:40,619
I need money.

1524
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:43,000
Start selling on the right side.

1525
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:52,920
Of course the price goes down immediately.

1526
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:53,880
Oh go left.

1527
02:09:53,880 --> 02:10:19,079
Okay don't sell right at all.

1528
02:10:19,079 --> 02:10:23,319
You look like Elmo today.

1529
02:10:23,319 --> 02:10:25,130
Oh do I?

1530
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:26,750
Thanks.

1531
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:29,579
You thought I was going to do it.

1532
02:10:29,579 --> 02:10:30,859
You were waiting for it.

1533
02:10:30,859 --> 02:10:52,159
Okay let's.

1534
02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:53,600
Okay actually keep selling on the left.

1535
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,729
There's more down here.

1536
02:11:00,729 --> 02:11:10,590
I need more.

1537
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:14,199
I'm gonna.

1538
02:11:14,199 --> 02:11:15,319
Yeah it's July.

1539
02:11:15,319 --> 02:11:17,289
I'm gonna double drain this one.

1540
02:11:17,289 --> 02:11:19,479
It is fucking July.

1541
02:11:19,479 --> 02:11:20,439
Like I gotta go.

1542
02:11:20,439 --> 02:11:57,319
Grab that right side.

1543
02:11:57,319 --> 02:12:07,390
Right side.

1544
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:07,630
Come on.

1545
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:07,789
Come on.

1546
02:12:07,789 --> 02:12:11,199
It's a dollar.

1547
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:12,079
All right stop.

1548
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:16,060
Where are we going next?

1549
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:18,359
I need some bowls.

1550
02:12:18,359 --> 02:12:34,619
Okay I think this is almost done.

1551
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:35,659
What's with the oil?

1552
02:12:35,659 --> 02:12:40,909
What's with this terrible just non no oil here?

1553
02:12:40,909 --> 02:12:43,579
This is none.

1554
02:12:43,579 --> 02:12:44,060
I spent.

1555
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:44,939
Did I spend money here?

1556
02:12:44,939 --> 02:12:45,659
No I didn't.

1557
02:12:45,659 --> 02:12:47,229
Pretty much free.

1558
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:54,510
But this shit is empty man.

1559
02:12:54,510 --> 02:13:11,689
What a bust.

1560
02:13:11,689 --> 02:13:17,020
Unless there's something over here.

1561
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:30,460
No that's it.

1562
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:32,539
I think I'm gonna get out of here.

1563
02:13:32,539 --> 02:13:34,539
Everything's empty right?

1564
02:13:34,539 --> 02:13:36,159
All right let's get the thousand bucks back.

1565
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:36,960
There's nothing else here.

1566
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,239
This place is a fucking joke.

1567
02:13:38,239 --> 02:13:46,090
This place is a joke.

1568
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:55,239
Okay 30k.

1569
02:13:55,239 --> 02:14:05,069
Somebody give me 76 is not enough.

1570
02:14:05,069 --> 02:14:07,229
Make it 90 and I'll pay five grand for it.

1571
02:14:07,229 --> 02:14:10,220
Which I do now.

1572
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,850
No spilling.

1573
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:12,489
Yeah that's right.

1574
02:14:12,489 --> 02:14:27,399
I really think I want that right now.

1575
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:30,699
Dowsing rod.

1576
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:33,069
I don't really use them.

1577
02:14:33,069 --> 02:14:33,789
We could do moles.

1578
02:14:34,779 --> 02:14:36,939
Faster moles for the scanner.

1579
02:14:36,939 --> 02:14:39,289
Thicker pipes.

1580
02:14:39,289 --> 02:14:40,890
Yeah that's probably the best to play.

1581
02:14:42,109 --> 02:14:44,189
With three size three.

1582
02:14:44,189 --> 02:14:45,149
With three.

1583
02:14:45,149 --> 02:14:49,399
Yeah we can really just drain it.

1584
02:14:49,399 --> 02:14:49,720
All right.

1585
02:14:50,439 --> 02:14:51,159
With three.

1586
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:57,149
Yeah that was pretty bad.

1587
02:14:57,149 --> 02:14:58,170
That's where it just was.

1588
02:14:58,170 --> 02:14:58,569
Look at this.

1589
02:15:00,109 --> 02:15:01,229
First dig.

1590
02:15:02,270 --> 02:15:03,149
Second dig.

1591
02:15:03,149 --> 02:15:03,710
Third dig.

1592
02:15:04,859 --> 02:15:05,659
Terrible.

1593
02:15:05,659 --> 02:15:10,060
Maybe go to the bottom.

1594
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:15,289
Should I go right down to the bottom?

1595
02:15:15,289 --> 02:15:20,590
I don't know if I want this.

1596
02:15:20,590 --> 02:15:21,710
I'm at 35.

1597
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:23,390
28.

1598
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,960
42.

1599
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,800
The adjacent ones are gonna be terrible.

1600
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,800
I'm just gonna go right down here.

1601
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:33,079
Yeah they're gonna.

1602
02:15:33,079 --> 02:15:33,560
I knew it.

1603
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,939
I knew that's what was gonna happen.

1604
02:15:36,939 --> 02:15:46,560
I'm not getting involved.

1605
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:47,920
Oh they're upgrading stuff.

1606
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:48,319
I get it.

1607
02:15:48,319 --> 02:15:49,579
Okay.

1608
02:15:49,579 --> 02:15:50,460
All right let's go.

1609
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:58,220
I'm gonna upgrade pipes twice.

1610
02:15:58,220 --> 02:15:58,939
All right moles.

1611
02:15:59,739 --> 02:16:02,380
I like the moles more than the dowsing people.

1612
02:16:05,949 --> 02:16:07,149
All right don't go overboard.

1613
02:16:07,149 --> 02:16:08,750
I'm going overboard so bad.

1614
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:18,560
Stop.

1615
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:21,609
Start.

1616
02:16:21,609 --> 02:16:22,810
And here's my plan.

1617
02:16:22,810 --> 02:16:32,079
Is this stupid?

1618
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:35,520
Is this stupid?

1619
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:42,569
Because then I'm gonna go bang bang.

1620
02:16:42,569 --> 02:16:43,209
Is that stupid?

1621
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:56,700
What's happening?

1622
02:16:56,700 --> 02:17:00,110
I fucked up bad.

1623
02:17:00,110 --> 02:17:02,190
I don't have a fucking horse.

1624
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:07,879
Did I lose?

1625
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:11,280
Is the game over?

1626
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,920
Oh okay.

1627
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,040
I'll take a $500 loan.

1628
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:14,600
Thank you.

1629
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:19,260
I thought I actually just lost the game.

1630
02:17:56,879 --> 02:17:58,639
This is dumb what I'm doing isn't it?

1631
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:20,120
Maybe not.

1632
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:31,840
Oh there's so much money on that left side and right side.

1633
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:35,360
All right thank god.

1634
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:36,559
Okay back in the game.

1635
02:18:36,559 --> 02:18:37,200
Let's go.

1636
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:45,100
There's something right there.

1637
02:18:45,100 --> 02:19:02,360
No diamonds though weirdly enough.

1638
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:03,159
Pay the loan?

1639
02:19:03,159 --> 02:19:08,040
How do I pay the loan?

1640
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,079
Total debt 700.

1641
02:19:09,079 --> 02:19:10,040
How do I pay the loan?

1642
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:13,309
Can I pay it from here?

1643
02:19:13,309 --> 02:19:23,000
I don't think I can do it from.

1644
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:23,799
You pay it at the end.

1645
02:19:23,799 --> 02:19:24,920
Yeah that's all right.

1646
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:26,920
It's not gonna be too bad.

1647
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:36,040
All right this is level three.

1648
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:44,459
I need to okay.

1649
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:45,879
Is there any more oil?

1650
02:19:45,879 --> 02:19:51,530
This one's a lot.

1651
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:54,250
So okay this is gonna be overflowing soon.

1652
02:19:54,250 --> 02:19:59,709
I knew it.

1653
02:19:59,709 --> 02:20:00,829
I'm trying to get in front of it.

1654
02:20:00,829 --> 02:20:02,239
Okay we're good.

1655
02:20:02,239 --> 02:20:03,040
Don't sell anything.

1656
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,319
These are terrible prices.

1657
02:20:04,319 --> 02:20:11,709
All right I'm gonna go right here.

1658
02:20:11,709 --> 02:20:17,180
Got something?

1659
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:18,059
Oh of course you do.

1660
02:20:18,059 --> 02:20:19,739
Why am I even hiring that guy?

1661
02:20:19,739 --> 02:20:22,379
I'm gonna be in trouble.

1662
02:20:22,379 --> 02:20:24,139
This is these prices are bad.

1663
02:20:24,139 --> 02:20:32,159
Please look at this.

1664
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:33,760
What's with this price?

1665
02:20:37,309 --> 02:20:39,040
Just close it?

1666
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,000
30 cents?

1667
02:20:41,389 --> 02:20:42,590
No you can fuck off.

1668
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:53,149
I'm not 30 cents.

1669
02:20:53,149 --> 02:20:54,190
40 cents?

1670
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:55,469
I have to dump it.

1671
02:20:55,469 --> 02:20:59,229
I actually have to dump this.

1672
02:20:59,229 --> 02:21:00,959
Because it's gonna start spilling.

1673
02:21:00,959 --> 02:21:02,159
I'm gonna have to pay.

1674
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:03,930
Take another silo.

1675
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:13,049
Just I mean of course.

1676
02:21:13,049 --> 02:21:16,090
Of course the price literally is fine now.

1677
02:21:16,090 --> 02:21:19,149
No I'm not selling.

1678
02:21:19,149 --> 02:21:19,709
Stop.

1679
02:21:19,709 --> 02:21:20,350
Stop it.

1680
02:21:20,350 --> 02:21:21,069
No selling.

1681
02:21:21,069 --> 02:21:25,079
Actually no this is okay.

1682
02:21:25,079 --> 02:21:25,399
That's all right.

1683
02:21:25,399 --> 02:21:26,200
Dump dump dump dump.

1684
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:26,600
Get rid of it.

1685
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,829
Dump it all.

1686
02:21:28,829 --> 02:21:29,309
Wait hold on.

1687
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:29,950
No no no no no.

1688
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:30,350
Stop hold on.

1689
02:21:30,350 --> 02:21:33,000
Don't do it yet.

1690
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:33,799
95 cents?

1691
02:21:33,799 --> 02:21:35,079
It's gonna be up like a dollar something.

1692
02:21:35,079 --> 02:21:43,530
Okay hold on.

1693
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:46,360
It's almost time.

1694
02:21:46,360 --> 02:21:53,600
Nope.

1695
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:54,959
Oh yes.

1696
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:59,610
Look at that one.

1697
02:21:59,610 --> 02:22:01,370
Oh we did it at the perfect time.

1698
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:02,329
Perfect timing.

1699
02:22:02,329 --> 02:22:04,649
Let's go.

1700
02:22:04,649 --> 02:22:13,979
I need to figure out where more oil is.

1701
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:23,819
All right hold it.

1702
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:25,559
I think it's time to hold it.

1703
02:22:25,559 --> 02:22:37,180
All right stop.

1704
02:22:37,180 --> 02:22:39,229
All right stop selling.

1705
02:22:39,229 --> 02:22:40,590
Start storing now.

1706
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:41,930
Take them out.

1707
02:22:41,930 --> 02:22:47,319
Check over here.

1708
02:22:47,319 --> 02:22:56,829
That might be it.

1709
02:22:56,829 --> 02:22:59,049
See anything?

1710
02:22:59,049 --> 02:23:01,559
It's a lot of wagons.

1711
02:23:01,559 --> 02:23:02,360
Yeah I kind of freaked out.

1712
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:03,000
It's all right though.

1713
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:03,959
They're only 150.

1714
02:23:03,959 --> 02:23:07,209
September.

1715
02:23:07,209 --> 02:23:09,370
Okay at the end of October I can start selling.

1716
02:23:09,370 --> 02:23:16,430
76 is a good floor price now don't you think?

1717
02:23:16,430 --> 02:23:17,549
Yeah that's true.

1718
02:23:17,549 --> 02:23:31,149
I wonder how big this is.

1719
02:23:31,149 --> 02:23:32,190
Oh shit.

1720
02:23:32,190 --> 02:23:32,989
That might be it.

1721
02:23:32,989 --> 02:23:37,290
Do I just hold this oil till November?

1722
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:39,229
Because I don't think there's anything else here.

1723
02:23:39,229 --> 02:23:46,510
I mean I'm gonna check.

1724
02:23:46,510 --> 02:23:47,229
This is it.

1725
02:23:47,309 --> 02:23:54,780
That's it.

1726
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:57,790
There's nothing else here.

1727
02:23:57,790 --> 02:23:58,750
22 cents over.

1728
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:04,409
Yeah there's nothing here.

1729
02:24:04,409 --> 02:24:04,729
80.

1730
02:24:04,729 --> 02:24:05,450
Okay November.

1731
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:15,629
Oh we're gonna get a good price.

1732
02:24:15,629 --> 02:24:16,030
20.

1733
02:24:16,829 --> 02:24:17,309
1.

1734
02:24:17,309 --> 02:24:18,590
25.

1735
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:19,709
Wait till like 1.

1736
02:24:19,709 --> 02:24:23,629
Okay go go go go.

1737
02:24:23,629 --> 02:24:24,430
It's not coming up.

1738
02:24:24,430 --> 02:24:30,670
All right I'm good.

1739
02:24:30,670 --> 02:24:34,190
That was worth it.

1740
02:24:34,190 --> 02:24:36,510
The $1,000 I would have gotten is not a big deal.

1741
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:37,469
That was like 10 grand.

1742
02:24:37,469 --> 02:24:38,350
There's nothing else here.

1743
02:24:38,350 --> 02:24:48,729
Another terrible one.

1744
02:24:48,729 --> 02:24:50,649
I keep picking the winners don't I?

1745
02:24:50,649 --> 02:24:53,559
That's sad.

1746
02:25:04,590 --> 02:25:05,709
This doesn't look correct.

1747
02:25:06,350 --> 02:25:10,280
This looks like I'm doing something wrong.

1748
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:14,520
This looks like a weird food budget list.

1749
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:16,440
Yeah what are you what are you getting for food?

1750
02:25:16,440 --> 02:25:19,639
Well you know 80% bread.

1751
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:27,840
And then like a head of lettuce.

1752
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:29,840
Here's the here's the cabbage.

1753
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:31,610
There's a cabbage slice.

1754
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:38,120
There's like a weird food pyramid.

1755
02:25:43,469 --> 02:25:45,389
Maybe I'm spending too much money.

1756
02:25:45,389 --> 02:25:49,260
Can't see the cursor.

1757
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:50,479
Weird why not?

1758
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:52,909
Have you guys not been able to see the cursor the whole time?

1759
02:26:01,129 --> 02:26:11,040
What?

1760
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:11,920
Well that's weird.

1761
02:26:12,479 --> 02:26:16,860
So you were probably guessing what the hell I was doing this whole time.

1762
02:26:17,420 --> 02:26:21,129
There's been no cursor.

1763
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:35,850
Has there been a point?

1764
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:37,840
It was fine though okay.

1765
02:26:38,639 --> 02:26:40,079
We weren't even watching dude.

1766
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:48,920
Okay.

1767
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:49,799
I have an announcement to make.

1768
02:26:49,799 --> 02:26:51,479
I will soon retire as mayor.

1769
02:26:51,479 --> 02:26:55,159
My successor will be the one who has the most shares of my town.

1770
02:26:55,159 --> 02:26:59,020
Which I will gradually sell at the new stock auction.

1771
02:27:01,799 --> 02:27:02,440
What?

1772
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:06,110
I'm selling my shares of the town.

1773
02:27:06,110 --> 02:27:09,389
Let's go to the auction and see who takes a step closer to becoming the new mayor.

1774
02:27:09,389 --> 02:27:17,149
Press the start button to start the auction.

1775
02:27:17,149 --> 02:27:22,030
The first one to press the buy button acquires 2% of the town's shares.

1776
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:23,610
How much are they?

1777
02:27:23,610 --> 02:27:24,409
What do they cost?

1778
02:27:28,059 --> 02:27:29,420
There is it $36,000?

1779
02:27:30,459 --> 02:27:33,159
How much money do I have?

1780
02:27:33,159 --> 02:27:36,090
Okay I have 32,000.

1781
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:40,559
Is it 36 grand?

1782
02:27:58,639 --> 02:27:59,920
I own this fucking town.

1783
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:00,639
Let's go.

1784
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:05,420
Did I pay too much?

1785
02:28:06,350 --> 02:28:08,430
Did I just pay way too much?

1786
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:14,639
That was for only 2% of the shares?

1787
02:28:14,639 --> 02:28:22,879
That doesn't sound like a good idea now that I think about it.

1788
02:28:22,879 --> 02:28:28,430
I could have waited till like less than 5k probably.

1789
02:28:28,430 --> 02:28:29,389
Oh well.

1790
02:28:29,389 --> 02:28:35,370
Imagine getting 2% of the shares and you think you own the town.

1791
02:28:39,709 --> 02:28:40,909
Well I can't upgrade anything.

1792
02:28:41,709 --> 02:28:42,750
That was really dumb.

1793
02:28:43,309 --> 02:28:48,059
Do I do it again?

1794
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:49,180
No.

1795
02:28:49,739 --> 02:28:50,299
Okay.

1796
02:28:50,299 --> 02:29:01,280
The town is evaluated at $800,000 so I actually just didn't really do anything.

1797
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:05,309
I'm gonna hold on to the money.

1798
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:13,799
Again look at this trash.

1799
02:29:16,809 --> 02:29:17,930
Junk, junk, junk.

1800
02:29:17,930 --> 02:29:19,370
I need something that's not junk.

1801
02:29:20,889 --> 02:29:22,649
These are all bad though.

1802
02:29:22,649 --> 02:29:26,680
I'm just gonna go over here.

1803
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:27,979
Somebody said near the water.

1804
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:34,959
Hope you're right.

1805
02:29:35,680 --> 02:29:46,889
Okay.

1806
02:29:46,889 --> 02:29:48,159
Right Inc.

1807
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:56,030
It'll never go under a dollar.

1808
02:29:56,030 --> 02:29:57,149
That's ridiculous.

1809
02:29:57,149 --> 02:29:57,790
I have to do it.

1810
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:00,319
Okay.

1811
02:30:00,319 --> 02:30:03,920
So I gotta be ready to sell because it's never going under a buck.

1812
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:07,389
Let's do it.

1813
02:30:07,950 --> 02:30:09,659
Okay.

1814
02:30:09,659 --> 02:30:09,979
Let's go.

1815
02:30:09,979 --> 02:30:11,209
Hurry up.

1816
02:30:11,209 --> 02:30:11,770
Right Inc.

1817
02:30:12,569 --> 02:30:14,329
I hope it's all on the right side.

1818
02:30:14,329 --> 02:30:18,829
Get a dowser out there too.

1819
02:30:18,829 --> 02:30:19,790
We gotta go now.

1820
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:24,040
Got something good?

1821
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:24,520
Alright.

1822
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:25,239
Let's start.

1823
02:30:25,239 --> 02:30:54,270
Go, go, go.

1824
02:30:54,270 --> 02:30:54,909
Let's go.

1825
02:30:54,909 --> 02:30:55,549
Sell, sell.

1826
02:30:55,549 --> 02:30:55,950
Just do.

1827
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:56,510
I'm never gonna.

1828
02:30:56,510 --> 02:30:58,809
I'm not gonna even buy a storage unit.

1829
02:30:58,809 --> 02:30:59,770
Why would I?

1830
02:30:59,770 --> 02:31:01,040
Just sell permanently.

1831
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:01,840
Always sell.

1832
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:12,750
Where's this guy seeing this oil?

1833
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:34,920
Move guys.

1834
02:31:36,239 --> 02:32:13,260
Uh, oh boy.

1835
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:14,540
Oh boy.

1836
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:15,180
Oh boy.

1837
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:18,860
Go and buy it and sell it on the market over there.

1838
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:27,399
Oh shit.

1839
02:32:27,399 --> 02:32:31,040
Oh no.

1840
02:32:31,760 --> 02:32:38,540
Okay.

1841
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:38,780
What?

1842
02:32:38,780 --> 02:32:39,579
I freaked out.

1843
02:32:39,579 --> 02:32:50,270
I've not seen a single diamond by the way.

1844
02:32:50,270 --> 02:33:07,079
This one was junk too.

1845
02:33:07,079 --> 02:33:25,879
This one was junk too.

1846
02:33:25,879 --> 02:33:44,270
Great.

1847
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:45,469
I got a dollar.

1848
02:33:45,469 --> 02:33:58,809
You got anything for me here?

1849
02:33:58,809 --> 02:33:59,850
You do got something.

1850
02:33:59,850 --> 02:34:00,409
Finally.

1851
02:34:00,409 --> 02:34:01,450
My God.

1852
02:34:01,450 --> 02:34:46,399
What is going on here?

1853
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:47,040
Thank you.

1854
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:48,239
I would never would have seen that.

1855
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:52,600
What do I get?

1856
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:53,319
A diamond?

1857
02:34:53,319 --> 02:34:56,430
Got it.

1858
02:34:56,430 --> 02:34:57,770
You picked up a diamond.

1859
02:34:57,770 --> 02:34:59,129
If you're ever short on time,

1860
02:34:59,129 --> 02:35:00,889
use this button to play a little bit longer.

1861
02:35:00,889 --> 02:35:02,250
Exchange for a diamond.

1862
02:35:02,250 --> 02:35:06,409
Okay.

1863
02:35:06,409 --> 02:35:07,690
Well, no, I don't want to do that.

1864
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:43,450
Dumb face cam.

1865
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:46,329
Where?

1866
02:35:46,329 --> 02:35:54,559
Can't really go anywhere.

1867
02:35:54,559 --> 02:36:01,870
No, it blocks too much.

1868
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:02,510
Left of.

1869
02:36:02,510 --> 02:36:02,989
Wait.

1870
02:36:02,989 --> 02:36:12,120
I guess it could go up here.

1871
02:36:12,120 --> 02:36:12,600
Here?

1872
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:16,090
But then you guys can't see me selling stuff.

1873
02:36:16,090 --> 02:36:19,200
I just don't think I fit anywhere.

1874
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:20,239
Maybe here?

1875
02:36:20,239 --> 02:36:22,649
I don't fit anywhere.

1876
02:36:22,649 --> 02:36:29,040
No, I don't fit anywhere.

1877
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:29,760
It's too bad.

1878
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:31,979
I don't really fit anywhere.

1879
02:36:31,979 --> 02:36:38,000
Put myself right in the middle.

1880
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,879
I could do like here.

1881
02:36:41,879 --> 02:36:46,299
Next to the prices on the right.

1882
02:36:46,299 --> 02:36:50,219
I could just.

1883
02:36:50,219 --> 02:36:52,219
I mean, that's weird.

1884
02:36:52,219 --> 02:36:55,719
This is strange though.

1885
02:36:55,719 --> 02:36:58,170
No, I don't fit anywhere.

1886
02:36:58,170 --> 02:37:02,680
I'm just going to stay down here.

1887
02:37:02,680 --> 02:37:05,129
Oh, I shrunk it.

1888
02:37:05,129 --> 02:37:06,090
I shrunk it a little bit.

1889
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:14,350
It's not enough oil here.

1890
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:17,479
I got absolutely just ruined.

1891
02:37:17,479 --> 02:37:20,569
I think it's actually probably empty.

1892
02:37:20,569 --> 02:37:29,309
They're all just crowding this one thing.

1893
02:37:29,309 --> 02:37:29,629
Nice.

1894
02:37:29,629 --> 02:37:30,510
A dollar.

1895
02:37:30,510 --> 02:37:31,309
Fantastic.

1896
02:37:31,309 --> 02:37:37,899
We're in September.

1897
02:37:37,899 --> 02:37:39,180
I think it's empty.

1898
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:51,840
Carrying nothing here.

1899
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:52,879
Dowsers not finding anything.

1900
02:37:52,879 --> 02:38:04,030
Did you find anything?

1901
02:38:04,030 --> 02:38:04,989
15k.

1902
02:38:04,989 --> 02:38:08,600
I spent five grand to make it

1903
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:12,090
so I could sell this shit for $1 each.

1904
02:38:12,090 --> 02:38:13,129
I got a diamond though.

1905
02:38:13,129 --> 02:38:13,450
All right.

1906
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:14,569
Well, let's just end though.

1907
02:38:14,569 --> 02:38:27,850
How did you not find that?

1908
02:38:27,850 --> 02:38:30,170
He didn't find it.

1909
02:38:30,170 --> 02:38:35,200
Oh, stock auction.

1910
02:38:59,659 --> 02:39:00,780
What the fuck?

1911
02:39:00,780 --> 02:39:01,819
Who got it?

1912
02:39:01,819 --> 02:39:06,360
I clicked it and closed the menu.

1913
02:39:06,360 --> 02:39:09,129
1%.

1914
02:39:09,129 --> 02:39:11,520
Yeah, I got 2%.

1915
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:14,799
Pound for pound, I spent less than you did.

1916
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:38,430
I kind of want the scanner.

1917
02:39:38,430 --> 02:39:39,709
No, this is important.

1918
02:39:39,709 --> 02:39:42,940
It's important.

1919
02:39:42,940 --> 02:39:43,899
These things just get in the way.

1920
02:39:43,899 --> 02:39:44,620
I'm buying it.

1921
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:49,770
What do I do with the diamond again?

1922
02:39:49,770 --> 02:39:58,379
I can give this to somebody, right?

1923
02:39:58,379 --> 02:40:03,340
Diamonds.

1924
02:40:03,420 --> 02:40:05,739
Your diamonds are worth $25.41 a piece.

1925
02:40:05,739 --> 02:40:06,459
Sell me one.

1926
02:40:06,459 --> 02:40:07,799
Get out of here.

1927
02:40:07,799 --> 02:40:08,200
Kidding me.

1928
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:10,319
It's a solid diamond.

1929
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:11,840
It's worth like $50,000.

1930
02:40:11,840 --> 02:40:12,399
Get out of here.

1931
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:19,760
Looking for a piece of land with lots of oil.

1932
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:21,120
Give me one of your shiny diamonds

1933
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,159
and I'll point it out.

1934
02:40:22,159 --> 02:40:24,440
Is this guy a liar?

1935
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:25,399
I also don't have...

1936
02:40:25,399 --> 02:40:26,520
I'm not doing this yet.

1937
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:35,930
I don't have enough money.

1938
02:40:35,930 --> 02:40:36,889
Yeah, I'm not going to do that

1939
02:40:36,889 --> 02:40:40,250
because if I do that right now,

1940
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:41,450
I only have 7k to work with.

1941
02:40:41,450 --> 02:40:42,489
I need 2k.

1942
02:40:42,489 --> 02:40:44,379
So I only have 5k to work with

1943
02:40:44,379 --> 02:40:47,229
if somebody wants to outbid me.

1944
02:40:47,229 --> 02:40:48,829
Does Mary have any more tips?

1945
02:40:48,829 --> 02:40:54,329
If a dowser with all the depth upgrades

1946
02:40:54,329 --> 02:40:55,450
walks out of the screen,

1947
02:40:55,450 --> 02:40:57,290
it means that there are no more

1948
02:40:57,290 --> 02:41:01,229
new untapped oil pockets in the ground.

1949
02:41:01,229 --> 02:41:02,750
Well, so that was the problem.

1950
02:41:02,750 --> 02:41:06,750
If you're running out of silo space,

1951
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:07,709
don't forget you can also use

1952
02:41:07,709 --> 02:41:09,309
your wagons to store oil.

1953
02:41:09,309 --> 02:41:10,829
Yeah, I mean, I've been doing that.

1954
02:41:10,829 --> 02:41:13,799
Drilling around rocks can be cheaper

1955
02:41:13,799 --> 02:41:15,559
than spending money on the rig upgrade.

1956
02:41:15,559 --> 02:41:17,149
Keep in mind, however, that

1957
02:41:17,149 --> 02:41:19,549
longer pipelines are more expensive to upgrade.

1958
02:41:19,549 --> 02:41:24,040
Yeah, judging by the pie chart

1959
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:25,399
that we all looked at.

1960
02:41:25,399 --> 02:41:28,090
Connecting pipes from an upgraded rig

1961
02:41:28,090 --> 02:41:29,850
to pipes from a non-upgraded rig

1962
02:41:29,850 --> 02:41:30,969
will copy...

1963
02:41:30,969 --> 02:41:31,610
Wait a minute.

1964
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:41,340
Will copy all the upgrades to the new network.

1965
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,459
Wait, hold on.

1966
02:41:42,459 --> 02:41:46,700
So if I just connect to this,

1967
02:41:46,700 --> 02:41:47,579
I don't have to buy that.

1968
02:41:52,809 --> 02:41:54,649
But you have to go a long way for that, though.

1969
02:41:54,649 --> 02:41:55,129
This is...

1970
02:41:55,129 --> 02:41:57,819
OK, going from here to here

1971
02:41:57,819 --> 02:42:00,620
is probably like six or seven hundred dollars.

1972
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:04,079
How much would it be to upgrade this?

1973
02:42:04,079 --> 02:42:05,040
Three or four hundred?

1974
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:11,950
It's probably cheaper than

1975
02:42:11,950 --> 02:42:13,149
buying the drill rig.

1976
02:42:13,149 --> 02:42:13,950
Probably.

1977
02:42:13,950 --> 02:42:16,510
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

1978
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:17,549
Cancel the scan in progress

1979
02:42:17,549 --> 02:42:18,829
by clicking anywhere above ground

1980
02:42:18,829 --> 02:42:20,670
or just click the right mouse button.

1981
02:42:20,670 --> 02:42:22,489
Good to know.

1982
02:42:22,489 --> 02:42:27,020
Actually, pretty useful stuff.

1983
02:42:27,020 --> 02:42:29,850
OK, I should probably eat.

1984
02:42:31,049 --> 02:42:31,930
OK, I'm going to do one more.

1985
02:42:31,930 --> 02:42:33,280
Here's what we're going to do.

1986
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:34,559
I'm going to do one more day.

1987
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:37,239
So I'm going to do one more day

1988
02:42:37,239 --> 02:42:38,600
and then I'm going to go eat

1989
02:42:38,600 --> 02:42:39,479
and I'm coming back.

1990
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:52,040
I need to eat something.

1991
02:42:52,040 --> 02:42:52,840
Well, hold on.

1992
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:57,659
I have a question.

1993
02:42:57,659 --> 02:42:58,219
Question.

1994
02:42:58,219 --> 02:43:01,180
Would you rather...

1995
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:04,219
Let's do a poll.

1996
02:43:04,219 --> 02:43:10,959
Would you rather me just to keep streaming

1997
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:12,239
all the way for like

1998
02:43:12,239 --> 02:43:14,559
at least another couple of hours, at least?

1999
02:43:14,559 --> 02:43:16,040
Another like two or three hours.

2000
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:16,760
Let's say like...

2001
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:18,860
Let's say at least 10 hours.

2002
02:43:18,860 --> 02:43:20,729
10 to 12 hours.

2003
02:43:20,729 --> 02:43:24,090
Or would you rather we stop now

2004
02:43:24,090 --> 02:43:26,010
and pick it up tomorrow afternoon

2005
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:28,459
and go again?

2006
02:43:28,459 --> 02:43:29,180
Like, would you rather have

2007
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:31,020
like a 12 hour stream tonight

2008
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:31,819
or would you rather have

2009
02:43:31,819 --> 02:43:34,139
like two six to eight hour streams

2010
02:43:34,139 --> 02:43:35,180
two days in a row?

2011
02:43:35,180 --> 02:43:44,219
So this is...

2012
02:43:44,219 --> 02:43:45,500
I mean, this is Omega Weekend.

2013
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:49,739
Should we do 12 hours tonight?

2014
02:43:49,739 --> 02:43:52,079
And then I won't be live tomorrow

2015
02:43:52,079 --> 02:43:54,440
because that would mean

2016
02:43:54,440 --> 02:43:56,200
I probably would go until like

2017
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,879
two plus o'clock in the morning.

2018
02:43:57,879 --> 02:43:59,340
And I definitely would...

2019
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:00,540
If I would stream tomorrow

2020
02:44:00,540 --> 02:44:02,219
would be like in the afternoon.

2021
02:44:02,219 --> 02:44:17,680
What do you think?

2022
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:18,959
Do tomorrow. OK.

2023
02:44:18,959 --> 02:44:27,149
I'm going to...

2024
02:44:27,149 --> 02:44:28,670
I want to play this more though.

2025
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:32,670
Don't burn out.

2026
02:44:32,670 --> 02:44:33,229
I won't burn out.

2027
02:44:33,229 --> 02:44:33,709
I'll be all right.

2028
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:35,709
I want to play this.

2029
02:44:35,709 --> 02:44:52,969
All right.

2030
02:44:52,969 --> 02:44:54,170
So here's what we're going to do.

2031
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:55,450
It looks like it's pretty much...

2032
02:44:55,450 --> 02:44:57,479
It's decided.

2033
02:44:57,479 --> 02:45:00,120
I am going to do one more day here.

2034
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:02,889
So I'm going to do another day.

2035
02:45:02,889 --> 02:45:06,780
And then we're going to start

2036
02:45:06,780 --> 02:45:08,219
with this tomorrow.

2037
02:45:08,219 --> 02:45:11,319
How much longer is the desert?

2038
02:45:11,319 --> 02:45:16,760
But what if I want to go?

2039
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:18,120
What if we just go, man?

2040
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:23,120
You know what I mean?

2041
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:24,239
What if we just go?

2042
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:24,959
And like, fuck it.

2043
02:45:24,959 --> 02:45:25,360
Who cares?

2044
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:26,479
And let's just like go for like

2045
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:34,079
15 hours or something.

2046
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:34,719
Is that crazy?

2047
02:45:34,719 --> 02:45:35,360
Should I not do that?

2048
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,069
OK.

2049
02:45:37,069 --> 02:45:38,399
Hey.

2050
02:45:38,399 --> 02:45:39,360
Hey.

2051
02:45:39,360 --> 02:45:40,000
Hey.

2052
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,200
Hey, you over there.

2053
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:49,229
Guess what?

2054
02:45:49,229 --> 02:45:50,110
Should I go?

2055
02:45:50,110 --> 02:45:51,629
I want to keep playing though.

2056
02:45:51,629 --> 02:45:52,829
But I don't want to...

2057
02:45:52,829 --> 02:45:56,940
It's been like almost nine hours.

2058
02:45:57,260 --> 02:46:03,760
It is Omega Weekend.

2059
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:05,149
I'm staying.

2060
02:46:05,149 --> 02:46:06,510
I'm not going anywhere.

2061
02:46:06,510 --> 02:46:07,629
I'm staying.

2062
02:46:07,629 --> 02:46:08,909
I'm going to go eat some food.

2063
02:46:08,909 --> 02:46:09,549
I'm coming back.

2064
02:46:09,549 --> 02:46:11,229
And this may be...

2065
02:46:11,229 --> 02:46:12,430
I'm just going to make it...

2066
02:46:12,430 --> 02:46:14,440
This could be...

2067
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:15,799
This is Omega Weekend.

2068
02:46:15,799 --> 02:46:19,120
Can we stop on Omega...

2069
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,159
Oh, it's Omega Weekend.

2070
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:21,280
Let me stop.

2071
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:23,440
You stop on Omega Gaming Weekend?

2072
02:46:23,440 --> 02:46:26,079
I don't think so.

2073
02:46:26,079 --> 02:46:27,120
I'm going to keep playing this.

2074
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,319
I'm going to keep going as long...

2075
02:46:28,319 --> 02:46:29,440
Because I still want to play this.

2076
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:30,239
I'm still really into this.

2077
02:46:30,239 --> 02:46:32,159
I think I'm having a great time.

2078
02:46:32,159 --> 02:46:33,680
So like, oh, I'm going to leave.

2079
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,040
And all I'm going to be doing

2080
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:35,840
when I'm sitting there eating

2081
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:37,319
is just going...

2082
02:46:37,319 --> 02:46:39,530
I want to play that fucking oil game.

2083
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:40,090
Right now.

2084
02:46:40,090 --> 02:46:44,090
I'll be right back.

2085
02:46:44,090 --> 02:46:45,639
I'll be right back.

2086
02:46:45,639 --> 02:46:47,399
I'm going to eat a little bit of food.

2087
02:46:47,399 --> 02:46:48,280
Get some water.

2088
02:46:48,280 --> 02:46:49,950
Stretch a little bit.

2089
02:46:49,950 --> 02:46:50,510
And I'm coming back.

2090
02:46:50,510 --> 02:46:51,549
We're going to at least finish the desert.

2091
02:46:51,549 --> 02:46:52,829
We're going to finish the desert at least.

2092
02:46:59,639 --> 02:47:01,159
You should refund those points.

2093
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:03,680
Oh, yeah.

2094
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:06,159
Turn off the channel points to re-vote again.

2095
02:47:11,129 --> 02:47:14,170
Yeah, because people are spending their channel points.

2096
02:47:14,170 --> 02:47:14,409
All right.

2097
02:47:14,409 --> 02:47:15,370
Here we go.

2098
02:47:15,370 --> 02:47:16,489
Let's plan this out.

2099
02:47:16,489 --> 02:47:18,329
I'm going to at least beat the desert tonight.

2100
02:47:18,889 --> 02:47:21,600
Can somebody tell me what my longest dream ever was?

2101
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:22,479
What was it?

2102
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:24,350
What was the longest dream ever?

2103
02:47:24,350 --> 02:47:26,700
You thought I was fucking around when I said I'd make a weekend.

2104
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:28,139
I just want to prove this to you guys.

2105
02:47:28,139 --> 02:47:29,979
What's the longest dream I've ever done?

2106
02:47:29,979 --> 02:47:31,440
Was it 12 hours?

2107
02:47:31,440 --> 02:47:40,920
We're beating that record tonight.

2108
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,110
I'll be right back.

2109
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:43,469
I'm going to eat and stretch.

2110
02:47:43,469 --> 02:47:45,360
This is going to be the longest dream I've ever done.

2111
02:47:45,360 --> 02:47:46,079
I can already feel it.

2112
02:47:46,079 --> 02:47:46,879
I'm telling you right now.

2113
02:47:46,879 --> 02:47:49,360
This is going to be the longest dream I've ever done.

2114
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:50,159
Stamp it.

2115
02:47:50,159 --> 02:47:50,719
I'll be right back.

2116
02:47:55,579 --> 02:47:58,379
I want the exact time that Lord of the Rings was

2117
02:47:58,379 --> 02:48:00,059
because I'm beating that shit tonight.

2118
02:48:00,059 --> 02:48:01,530
That will be...

2119
02:48:01,530 --> 02:48:01,930
Wait, hold on.

2120
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:02,329
That will be...

2121
02:48:02,329 --> 02:48:02,969
Wait, wait, wait.

2122
02:48:02,969 --> 02:48:03,899
All right.

2123
02:48:03,899 --> 02:48:04,139
Wait.

2124
02:48:04,139 --> 02:48:05,979
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

2125
02:48:06,920 --> 02:48:10,440
That would be 9, 10, 11, 12, 12.

2126
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:11,719
Oh, we can fucking do this.

2127
02:48:12,799 --> 02:48:13,840
We can do this.

2128
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:14,559
I'm going for it.

2129
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:17,719
I feel great, by the way.

2130
02:48:17,719 --> 02:48:18,920
It's not like I feel okay.

2131
02:48:19,479 --> 02:48:22,079
I'll be right back.

2132
03:04:44,540 --> 03:04:47,479
So I didn't eat yet.

2133
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:53,000
I'm having food is being put in the oven.

2134
03:04:55,899 --> 03:04:58,569
I did jog in a circle.

2135
03:04:58,569 --> 03:04:59,450
I peed.

2136
03:04:59,450 --> 03:05:01,930
I refilled my tea here.

2137
03:05:03,340 --> 03:05:04,219
Got a bunch of water.

2138
03:05:07,479 --> 03:05:08,280
I did zoomies.

2139
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:09,959
I did the thing the dogs do.

2140
03:05:09,959 --> 03:05:11,000
I literally ran in a circle.

2141
03:05:11,719 --> 03:05:12,600
I'm kind of out of breath.

2142
03:05:14,909 --> 03:05:17,309
If you're going to sit down for like 15 hours

2143
03:05:17,309 --> 03:05:18,670
or like 14 hours or something,

2144
03:05:19,959 --> 03:05:21,000
you've got to get up and move.

2145
03:05:21,950 --> 03:05:22,590
Eventually.

2146
03:05:26,430 --> 03:05:27,950
Just microwave your food.

2147
03:05:29,149 --> 03:05:29,790
Well, no.

2148
03:05:30,909 --> 03:05:33,709
Holly is making French bread pizzas.

2149
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:37,360
So I don't want to...

2150
03:05:37,360 --> 03:05:39,440
You don't want to put the French bread pizza in the microwave.

2151
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:45,180
I don't rather be in the toaster or the oven or something.

2152
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:45,680
All right.

2153
03:05:46,299 --> 03:05:48,969
Yeah, there's other stuff too,

2154
03:05:48,969 --> 03:05:51,610
but I think that's the fastest thing to make.

2155
03:05:51,610 --> 03:05:54,639
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

2156
03:05:57,879 --> 03:05:58,200
Okay.

2157
03:06:01,069 --> 03:06:03,309
I ran in a circle for like five minutes

2158
03:06:03,309 --> 03:06:05,309
and I may have tired myself out for the stream.

2159
03:06:06,639 --> 03:06:07,600
Wow, that was a mistake.

2160
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:09,719
Why did I think that was a good idea?

2161
03:06:09,719 --> 03:06:10,440
Oh yeah, dude.

2162
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:13,079
I've been streaming for like nine hours.

2163
03:06:13,079 --> 03:06:13,639
Oh yeah.

2164
03:06:13,639 --> 03:06:17,309
Let me get up and run in a circle for five minutes.

2165
03:06:17,309 --> 03:06:18,190
I'm kidding.

2166
03:06:18,190 --> 03:06:18,750
Don't worry.

2167
03:06:18,750 --> 03:06:20,860
I'm just kidding.

2168
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,100
Okay.

2169
03:06:22,059 --> 03:06:22,540
Yes.

2170
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:22,860
Okay.

2171
03:06:23,819 --> 03:06:24,139
I got...

2172
03:06:24,139 --> 03:06:26,459
If there's ever a time that I'm going to break that,

2173
03:06:26,459 --> 03:06:27,020
like what?

2174
03:06:27,020 --> 03:06:28,620
12 hours, 13 hours?

2175
03:06:28,620 --> 03:06:31,260
It's going to be right now.

2176
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:33,180
There ain't no fucking way I ain't going to do it.

2177
03:06:33,180 --> 03:06:36,000
Unless I shit my pants,

2178
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,200
which I would just stay here.

2179
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:38,879
I wouldn't leave and I wouldn't tell you.

2180
03:06:38,879 --> 03:06:41,479
All right.

2181
03:06:41,479 --> 03:06:42,840
Are you still streaming tomorrow?

2182
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:44,040
That is a great question.

2183
03:06:44,040 --> 03:06:46,459
If I cross 14 plus hours

2184
03:06:46,459 --> 03:06:48,459
and it's like three o'clock in the morning Pacific,

2185
03:06:48,459 --> 03:06:48,860
I don't...

2186
03:06:48,860 --> 03:06:54,520
I'm going to say probably not on Saturday.

2187
03:06:54,520 --> 03:06:55,000
We'll see.

2188
03:07:01,899 --> 03:07:02,459
Okay.

2189
03:07:02,459 --> 03:07:14,670
Play Diablo 2.

2190
03:07:14,670 --> 03:07:15,950
It's my birthday.

2191
03:07:16,780 --> 03:07:18,299
You lied about Omega Weekend.

2192
03:07:19,290 --> 03:07:20,329
Hold on here.

2193
03:07:20,329 --> 03:07:21,690
Hold on here.

2194
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:23,709
Wait just a second.

2195
03:07:23,709 --> 03:07:27,709
Where everybody gets a little annoyed with me.

2196
03:07:27,709 --> 03:07:29,229
Omega Weekend.

2197
03:07:29,229 --> 03:07:30,190
Omega Weekend.

2198
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:34,360
I'm about to break the longest stream I've ever done ever.

2199
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:36,280
I think that's Omega Weekend.

2200
03:07:36,280 --> 03:07:38,489
That's Omega Friday.

2201
03:07:38,489 --> 03:07:39,930
That's an Omega stream.

2202
03:07:39,930 --> 03:07:41,209
That's Omega Weekend.

2203
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:46,399
We'll see.

2204
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:52,110
If I get up tomorrow, I'll be fine.

2205
03:07:52,110 --> 03:07:54,110
Omega Friday equals Omega Weekend.

2206
03:07:54,110 --> 03:07:55,879
Well, hold on.

2207
03:07:55,879 --> 03:07:57,479
I'm technically...

2208
03:07:57,479 --> 03:07:59,399
I will be technically streaming on Saturday

2209
03:07:59,399 --> 03:08:00,760
for like three or four hours.

2210
03:08:00,760 --> 03:08:04,200
Excuse me?

2211
03:08:04,200 --> 03:08:05,000
Omega Friday?

2212
03:08:11,129 --> 03:08:12,409
Omega...

2213
03:08:12,409 --> 03:08:14,010
Omega Weekend.

2214
03:08:14,569 --> 03:08:22,090
But hold on.

2215
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:24,250
Let's go over this really quickly.

2216
03:08:24,250 --> 03:08:24,809
We're going to chill.

2217
03:08:24,809 --> 03:08:25,530
This is going to be a chill.

2218
03:08:25,530 --> 03:08:26,170
Like it's getting late

2219
03:08:26,170 --> 03:08:27,290
and I don't want to be like loud

2220
03:08:27,290 --> 03:08:28,250
and screaming at people and stuff.

2221
03:08:28,250 --> 03:08:28,969
But I don't know what to mean.

2222
03:08:28,969 --> 03:08:30,170
We might play something else a little bit.

2223
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:34,809
A typical stream that I do,

2224
03:08:34,809 --> 03:08:37,520
forget that it's Omega Weekend,

2225
03:08:38,079 --> 03:08:38,559
is what?

2226
03:08:38,559 --> 03:08:40,239
Between five and seven hours?

2227
03:08:40,239 --> 03:08:43,899
Seven and seven is 14.

2228
03:08:43,899 --> 03:08:45,979
That's like streaming seven hours on Friday,

2229
03:08:45,979 --> 03:08:48,000
seven hours on Saturday,

2230
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,799
and then an extra epilogue stream on Sunday

2231
03:08:50,799 --> 03:08:53,120
to like just smoke a bowl and hang out.

2232
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:56,620
It's not happening, by the way.

2233
03:08:56,620 --> 03:08:57,260
Semantics.

2234
03:09:05,639 --> 03:09:06,280
All right, let's play.

2235
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:06,680
Let's play.

2236
03:09:07,639 --> 03:09:08,280
I'm having a lot of fun.

2237
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:09,079
This game is fucking awesome.

2238
03:09:09,079 --> 03:09:10,360
Did this game come out this year?

2239
03:09:10,360 --> 03:09:13,709
Did this game come out in 2022?

2240
03:09:13,709 --> 03:09:14,909
Because it's like this is

2241
03:09:14,909 --> 03:09:17,440
one of my favorite games that came out.

2242
03:09:17,440 --> 03:09:18,159
This is great.

2243
03:09:18,159 --> 03:09:19,040
I love this.

2244
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:19,920
Came out last year.

2245
03:09:19,920 --> 03:09:20,479
Oh, shit.

2246
03:09:20,479 --> 03:09:20,959
Well, whatever.

2247
03:09:20,959 --> 03:09:21,200
All right.

2248
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:22,000
I'm going to go over here.

2249
03:09:27,530 --> 03:09:28,569
Pretty slim at the moment.

2250
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:30,399
Pretty slim.

2251
03:09:31,340 --> 03:09:31,819
I'm going to stay here.

2252
03:09:32,540 --> 03:09:37,559
It was early access in 2016.

2253
03:09:38,200 --> 03:09:38,520
Really?

2254
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:40,250
Damn.

2255
03:09:40,809 --> 03:09:41,049
Okay.

2256
03:09:46,200 --> 03:09:57,469
Damn.

2257
03:09:57,469 --> 03:09:58,110
Geez.

2258
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:01,639
Okay.

2259
03:10:01,639 --> 03:10:07,389
Okay, let's go.

2260
03:10:07,389 --> 03:10:13,760
What are your thoughts on Internet

2261
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:15,280
raising their double double price?

2262
03:10:15,280 --> 03:10:16,239
Well, you're eating it in and out.

2263
03:10:16,239 --> 03:10:17,120
That was the first mistake.

2264
03:10:32,379 --> 03:10:32,860
Okay.

2265
03:10:32,860 --> 03:10:34,459
Can upgrade silos twice?

2266
03:10:34,459 --> 03:10:36,909
How do you go?

2267
03:10:36,909 --> 03:10:37,389
Okay.

2268
03:10:37,389 --> 03:10:38,430
For the audio levels?

2269
03:10:41,120 --> 03:10:43,360
I mean, we're getting to the later hours, right?

2270
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:45,879
Should we have like not the loud,

2271
03:10:45,879 --> 03:10:48,120
like, you know, the music,

2272
03:10:48,680 --> 03:10:49,639
the sounds in the background?

2273
03:10:49,639 --> 03:10:50,600
What do you guys think?

2274
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:54,110
I just feel we should probably lower the lights here, too.

2275
03:10:54,110 --> 03:10:54,989
Don't you think?

2276
03:10:54,989 --> 03:10:57,000
Is it okay?

2277
03:10:57,719 --> 03:11:01,239
These kind of don't don't don't don't don't sounds.

2278
03:11:01,239 --> 03:11:06,959
You okay with these candles?

2279
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:08,319
Candles?

2280
03:11:08,319 --> 03:11:12,559
Turn it down a little.

2281
03:11:12,559 --> 03:11:12,879
Okay.

2282
03:11:12,879 --> 03:11:13,920
Yeah, I think that's okay.

2283
03:11:14,559 --> 03:11:16,239
That's that's really good right there.

2284
03:11:16,239 --> 03:11:18,440
Get the nice music, the ambient sounds.

2285
03:11:18,440 --> 03:11:19,319
I think that you are.

2286
03:11:19,319 --> 03:11:19,719
All right.

2287
03:11:19,719 --> 03:11:21,840
Yeah, let me get let me turn lights off.

2288
03:11:32,860 --> 03:11:38,559
Oh, is that the better?

2289
03:11:38,559 --> 03:11:42,360
Although I'm kind of like low FPS, aren't I?

2290
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:49,389
It's okay.

2291
03:11:49,389 --> 03:11:51,950
It's doing automatic gain adjustment.

2292
03:11:52,750 --> 03:12:00,250
So the lower I that's annoying.

2293
03:12:00,250 --> 03:12:00,969
Hold on.

2294
03:12:00,969 --> 03:12:13,020
Is that comfy or is that scary?

2295
03:12:13,899 --> 03:12:29,840
It's too scary.

2296
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:30,719
Well, fuck.

2297
03:12:30,719 --> 03:12:44,159
Never mind.

2298
03:12:44,159 --> 03:12:45,200
I tried.

2299
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:56,680
I tried.

2300
03:12:56,680 --> 03:13:03,680
Oh, well, that looks so that's okay.

2301
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:04,559
That's fine.

2302
03:13:04,559 --> 03:13:14,940
Here's a little weird, though.

2303
03:13:14,940 --> 03:13:16,379
Wait, I think I know what I can do.

2304
03:13:18,139 --> 03:13:20,540
Oh, I can do this.

2305
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:39,020
This one is called hearth.

2306
03:13:39,020 --> 03:13:56,860
No, this looks better.

2307
03:13:56,860 --> 03:13:58,559
A little darker.

2308
03:13:58,559 --> 03:14:06,879
That looks that's comfier.

2309
03:14:06,879 --> 03:14:08,479
Yeah, that's that's much comfier.

2310
03:14:08,479 --> 03:14:17,040
That feels better.

2311
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:18,399
My face is like flickering.

2312
03:14:18,399 --> 03:14:22,250
The camera is so bad.

2313
03:14:22,250 --> 03:14:26,540
I haven't said what this camera is because, I mean, why?

2314
03:14:26,540 --> 03:14:27,500
I don't really care that much.

2315
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:28,940
But like this thing sucks.

2316
03:14:29,930 --> 03:14:31,129
It genuinely sucks.

2317
03:14:31,690 --> 03:14:32,329
It sucks.

2318
03:14:32,889 --> 03:14:36,940
It's because it's too cropped.

2319
03:14:43,420 --> 03:14:47,760
I don't really want to say what camera this is, but it sucks.

2320
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:55,440
I just play the other camera and it doesn't matter.

2321
03:14:55,440 --> 03:15:01,020
I know I'm stalling really bad.

2322
03:15:01,020 --> 03:15:10,750
I don't mind if I do this still flickering.

2323
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:12,809
Why is it flickering?

2324
03:15:12,809 --> 03:15:18,750
I don't get this.

2325
03:15:18,909 --> 03:15:29,180
Tons of flicker.

2326
03:15:29,180 --> 03:15:30,219
This game sucks.

2327
03:15:30,219 --> 03:15:32,219
Stop cropping it and do the zoom instead.

2328
03:15:32,219 --> 03:15:37,209
What do you mean?

2329
03:15:37,209 --> 03:15:41,639
Zoom?

2330
03:15:41,639 --> 03:15:42,600
Do two cameras.

2331
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:47,719
Oh, fuck.

2332
03:15:47,719 --> 03:15:48,200
Hold on.

2333
03:15:48,760 --> 03:15:49,799
Don't make me do this.

2334
03:15:50,700 --> 03:15:53,180
That's so dumb.

2335
03:15:53,180 --> 03:15:54,459
No, it's too late for this.

2336
03:15:54,459 --> 03:15:55,420
It's too late for this.

2337
03:15:55,420 --> 03:15:56,059
I'm just going to go.

2338
03:15:57,479 --> 03:15:59,879
It's far too late for this.

2339
03:15:59,879 --> 03:16:04,090
Let me turn this.

2340
03:16:04,090 --> 03:16:09,629
This is going to help.

2341
03:16:09,629 --> 03:16:10,110
There it is.

2342
03:16:10,110 --> 03:16:11,469
Not there.

2343
03:16:11,469 --> 03:16:12,430
It's not flickering anymore.

2344
03:16:12,989 --> 03:16:15,760
The better.

2345
03:16:18,110 --> 03:16:19,149
I don't see the flicker anymore.

2346
03:16:19,709 --> 03:16:23,479
I mean, maybe a little.

2347
03:16:23,479 --> 03:16:32,829
For zoom game.

2348
03:16:34,270 --> 03:16:34,510
All right.

2349
03:16:34,510 --> 03:16:35,149
So let's do it.

2350
03:16:35,149 --> 03:16:37,389
So this is the new year.

2351
03:16:37,950 --> 03:16:39,559
What did I just upgrade?

2352
03:16:39,559 --> 03:16:40,680
I just upgraded something, didn't I?

2353
03:16:44,030 --> 03:16:46,489
Welcome to the cozy string.

2354
03:16:47,209 --> 03:16:50,110
We need two.

2355
03:16:50,110 --> 03:16:56,120
Got some of that right here already.

2356
03:16:56,120 --> 03:17:02,940
I'm going to go this way and then maybe that way too.

2357
03:17:02,940 --> 03:17:04,459
Let's get a mole over there just to make sure.

2358
03:17:05,020 --> 03:17:14,200
Looks like everything is on the right side.

2359
03:17:24,409 --> 03:17:26,090
I spent a thousand dollars on moles.

2360
03:17:26,090 --> 03:17:26,969
I know, but it's all right.

2361
03:17:30,350 --> 03:17:31,659
Should I?

2362
03:17:31,659 --> 03:17:32,540
I'm going to.

2363
03:17:32,540 --> 03:17:33,879
It's going to overflow, isn't it?

2364
03:17:34,440 --> 03:17:49,370
All right, we're good.

2365
03:17:49,370 --> 03:17:49,930
Okay.

2366
03:17:49,930 --> 03:17:54,110
So now let's build one here.

2367
03:17:54,110 --> 03:17:55,629
And I'm going to do the connect thing, right?

2368
03:17:56,350 --> 03:18:04,090
If I go like this and then I eventually connect these two.

2369
03:18:04,090 --> 03:18:07,159
Sell left.

2370
03:18:07,159 --> 03:18:09,639
I can't sell left 95, 98.

2371
03:18:09,639 --> 03:18:10,440
We're good.

2372
03:18:10,440 --> 03:18:16,860
I'm going to do silo right here.

2373
03:18:16,860 --> 03:18:19,719
That makes sense to me.

2374
03:18:21,149 --> 03:18:21,629
There we go.

2375
03:18:22,190 --> 03:18:28,040
Sell right, sell right, sell right.

2376
03:18:28,040 --> 03:18:28,600
Okay.

2377
03:18:28,600 --> 03:18:30,120
I need more.

2378
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:31,559
It's time to upgrade.

2379
03:18:31,559 --> 03:18:33,559
This is where it gets scary.

2380
03:18:33,559 --> 03:18:36,409
I'm going to have at least five horses.

2381
03:18:36,969 --> 03:18:38,729
Be prepared to sell right.

2382
03:18:42,719 --> 03:18:43,760
There's so much here.

2383
03:18:43,760 --> 03:18:44,000
All right.

2384
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:48,079
So now I'm going to keep moving this over here.

2385
03:18:48,079 --> 03:18:49,280
We're going to double drain this.

2386
03:18:49,280 --> 03:18:52,559
I'm going to split this guy this way.

2387
03:18:52,559 --> 03:18:53,600
Yes, we are.

2388
03:18:53,600 --> 03:18:54,799
We're going to split you this way.

2389
03:18:57,280 --> 03:18:58,559
I'm going to upgrade this.

2390
03:19:02,760 --> 03:19:05,659
Is that do I want to do that?

2391
03:19:05,659 --> 03:19:07,360
All right, question.

2392
03:19:07,360 --> 03:19:08,959
If I connected this to this,

2393
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:12,620
is this going to become one pipe

2394
03:19:12,620 --> 03:19:21,159
or will they still be draining from here?

2395
03:19:21,159 --> 03:19:28,620
You just said yes.

2396
03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:29,420
Don't connect.

2397
03:19:29,420 --> 03:19:40,409
I'm going to need some more horses in a second.

2398
03:19:40,409 --> 03:19:41,709
Actually, no, I don't.

2399
03:19:41,709 --> 03:19:43,870
I keep buying a horse Andy over here.

2400
03:19:43,870 --> 03:19:44,350
Seriously.

2401
03:19:51,930 --> 03:19:52,569
All right.

2402
03:19:52,569 --> 03:19:52,969
Hold up.

2403
03:19:53,530 --> 03:19:56,799
All right.

2404
03:19:56,799 --> 03:19:58,399
There's a lot coming out of here right now.

2405
03:19:58,399 --> 03:19:59,840
I actually think I'm going to need more horses.

2406
03:20:00,399 --> 03:20:04,319
So far so good.

2407
03:20:06,409 --> 03:20:15,440
Mole action over here on the left.

2408
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:15,760
Don't.

2409
03:20:16,319 --> 03:20:16,639
Okay.

2410
03:20:16,639 --> 03:20:17,200
Wait, wait, wait.

2411
03:20:17,200 --> 03:20:18,239
Let's do another one here.

2412
03:20:21,450 --> 03:20:30,799
Hold, hold, hold.

2413
03:20:30,799 --> 03:20:39,680
I really want this left side to be better.

2414
03:20:44,559 --> 03:20:45,280
Hold it.

2415
03:20:45,280 --> 03:20:46,040
I'm not.

2416
03:20:46,040 --> 03:20:46,840
No, hold it.

2417
03:20:46,840 --> 03:20:47,719
Seriously.

2418
03:20:47,719 --> 03:20:49,530
This is going to go to like...

2419
03:20:49,530 --> 03:20:50,170
This is going to come down.

2420
03:20:50,170 --> 03:20:51,450
This is going to go to like a dollar fifty.

2421
03:20:52,010 --> 03:20:53,260
All right.

2422
03:20:53,260 --> 03:20:53,899
This one here.

2423
03:20:54,780 --> 03:21:02,620
We're not going to money it.

2424
03:21:02,620 --> 03:21:02,940
Okay.

2425
03:21:02,940 --> 03:21:03,260
All right.

2426
03:21:03,260 --> 03:21:03,739
We got to do it.

2427
03:21:03,739 --> 03:21:04,379
Wait, I got to sell.

2428
03:21:04,379 --> 03:21:04,780
We got to go.

2429
03:21:04,780 --> 03:21:06,379
Go, go, go, go, go, go before it goes down.

2430
03:21:13,370 --> 03:21:14,090
Don't spill.

2431
03:21:14,909 --> 03:21:15,709
Okay.

2432
03:21:15,709 --> 03:21:18,780
Right side.

2433
03:21:18,780 --> 03:21:19,180
Right side.

2434
03:21:19,180 --> 03:21:19,659
Right side.

2435
03:21:19,659 --> 03:21:20,139
No, no, no.

2436
03:21:20,139 --> 03:21:21,020
Hold it.

2437
03:21:21,020 --> 03:21:25,819
Oh, my God.

2438
03:21:25,819 --> 03:21:26,860
There's no oil coming out.

2439
03:21:26,860 --> 03:21:27,420
Oh, shit.

2440
03:21:27,420 --> 03:21:27,579
Okay.

2441
03:21:27,579 --> 03:21:28,059
What do I do?

2442
03:21:29,520 --> 03:21:33,879
This way.

2443
03:21:33,879 --> 03:21:34,520
Hold that.

2444
03:21:34,520 --> 03:21:35,079
Check this out.

2445
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:41,819
Connect this.

2446
03:21:41,819 --> 03:21:43,579
This is level three shit.

2447
03:21:44,299 --> 03:21:44,620
Right?

2448
03:21:46,889 --> 03:21:48,010
So that is going to do it.

2449
03:21:48,729 --> 03:21:50,489
Did that work?

2450
03:21:51,129 --> 03:21:53,209
Dollar fifteen.

2451
03:21:53,209 --> 03:21:54,250
I'm not doing it.

2452
03:21:54,250 --> 03:21:55,260
Did that not work?

2453
03:21:57,500 --> 03:21:57,819
What?

2454
03:21:57,819 --> 03:21:59,899
Isn't this going to upgrade everything to level three?

2455
03:21:59,899 --> 03:22:00,219
Am I?

2456
03:22:00,219 --> 03:22:01,579
Is that not how that works?

2457
03:22:01,579 --> 03:22:04,059
Sell.

2458
03:22:04,059 --> 03:22:04,620
Not yet.

2459
03:22:04,620 --> 03:22:05,100
Not yet.

2460
03:22:05,100 --> 03:22:05,420
Hold it.

2461
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:10,379
Is it going to go to like one forty?

2462
03:22:10,379 --> 03:22:15,319
That didn't work.

2463
03:22:15,319 --> 03:22:16,280
One twenty nine.

2464
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:18,879
One thirty.

2465
03:22:18,879 --> 03:22:21,559
One thirty one.

2466
03:22:22,120 --> 03:22:25,870
Thirty two.

2467
03:22:30,729 --> 03:22:31,690
Thirty three.

2468
03:22:35,389 --> 03:22:36,190
One thirty.

2469
03:22:42,840 --> 03:22:44,670
Yeah, that's good.

2470
03:22:45,389 --> 03:22:46,110
All right.

2471
03:22:46,110 --> 03:22:47,309
You can keep going right.

2472
03:22:47,309 --> 03:22:50,059
I want to go left now.

2473
03:22:50,059 --> 03:22:57,719
Let's have like a few of you be delivering.

2474
03:22:57,719 --> 03:23:00,379
All right.

2475
03:23:00,379 --> 03:23:01,950
I need some.

2476
03:23:01,950 --> 03:23:02,989
Did you look?

2477
03:23:02,989 --> 03:23:03,870
Are you seeing this?

2478
03:23:03,870 --> 03:23:07,000
Moles out.

2479
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:12,280
I feel like this one sucks ass too.

2480
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:22,299
Unfortunately, there's nothing on the left side.

2481
03:23:22,299 --> 03:23:22,860
That might be it.

2482
03:23:24,959 --> 03:23:30,510
I think that actually is it.

2483
03:23:30,510 --> 03:23:31,069
Ember.

2484
03:23:31,069 --> 03:23:32,920
I think that might be it.

2485
03:23:32,920 --> 03:23:34,360
Maybe check here.

2486
03:23:34,360 --> 03:23:37,610
What do you think?

2487
03:23:37,610 --> 03:23:38,090
Left.

2488
03:23:38,090 --> 03:23:41,719
Somewhere in the middle.

2489
03:23:41,719 --> 03:23:41,959
All right.

2490
03:23:42,760 --> 03:23:48,079
I'm spending a lot of money on moles.

2491
03:23:48,079 --> 03:23:49,120
Holy shit.

2492
03:23:49,120 --> 03:23:49,950
What was that?

2493
03:23:49,950 --> 03:23:50,829
Did I get a diamond?

2494
03:23:50,829 --> 03:23:51,629
I got a diamond.

2495
03:23:51,629 --> 03:23:52,829
So who found a diamond?

2496
03:23:52,829 --> 03:23:59,719
That's probably it though.

2497
03:23:59,719 --> 03:24:05,020
OK.

2498
03:24:05,020 --> 03:24:08,840
November.

2499
03:24:08,840 --> 03:24:10,200
Check over here.

2500
03:24:10,200 --> 03:24:11,079
Get a couple right.

2501
03:24:11,079 --> 03:24:11,319
OK.

2502
03:24:11,319 --> 03:24:12,040
That's it.

2503
03:24:12,040 --> 03:24:16,649
Sell on the right.

2504
03:24:16,649 --> 03:24:17,290
Final month.

2505
03:24:17,290 --> 03:24:19,559
That's it.

2506
03:24:19,559 --> 03:24:20,840
Oh, this is this is done.

2507
03:24:20,840 --> 03:24:22,780
This is done.

2508
03:24:22,780 --> 03:24:23,579
That's it.

2509
03:24:23,579 --> 03:24:24,299
Oh shit.

2510
03:24:24,299 --> 03:24:25,100
Doesn't matter.

2511
03:24:25,100 --> 03:24:27,209
Well, it's OK.

2512
03:24:27,290 --> 03:24:28,170
Pop middle.

2513
03:24:28,170 --> 03:24:34,879
I didn't even see it.

2514
03:24:34,879 --> 03:24:36,399
Oh, really?

2515
03:24:36,399 --> 03:24:40,860
It's OK.

2516
03:24:40,860 --> 03:24:43,629
I'll take 20 grand.

2517
03:24:43,629 --> 03:24:47,549
He's still streaming.

2518
03:24:47,549 --> 03:24:47,870
Yep.

2519
03:24:47,870 --> 03:24:50,190
If you are just if you're joining us for the first time

2520
03:24:50,190 --> 03:24:51,790
or you're joining us back from earlier,

2521
03:24:53,479 --> 03:24:55,079
the dude was waving you down.

2522
03:24:55,079 --> 03:24:57,799
Yeah, but I thought he was seeing the one I was already tapped into.

2523
03:24:59,389 --> 03:25:04,430
The longest stream I've ever done was...

2524
03:25:04,430 --> 03:25:05,870
Does anyone know the exact number?

2525
03:25:05,870 --> 03:25:11,229
I got two diamonds.

2526
03:25:11,229 --> 03:25:14,510
13 hours and four minutes and 13 hours, four minutes, 32 seconds.

2527
03:25:16,540 --> 03:25:20,030
If you're joining us, I'm going to break that tonight.

2528
03:25:20,030 --> 03:25:20,989
I'm going to...

2529
03:25:21,709 --> 03:25:23,469
This is going to be...

2530
03:25:23,469 --> 03:25:28,639
I'm breaking that longest stream ever in seven years.

2531
03:25:28,639 --> 03:25:29,680
I don't really do...

2532
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:32,000
And then people go, what do you do a 13 hour stream?

2533
03:25:33,309 --> 03:25:35,389
That's really like in the grand scheme of things,

2534
03:25:35,389 --> 03:25:36,510
like people do 24 hour...

2535
03:25:36,510 --> 03:25:39,389
People do like 12 to 24 hour streams all the time.

2536
03:25:39,389 --> 03:25:41,049
Not me.

2537
03:25:41,049 --> 03:25:44,329
Not me.

2538
03:25:44,329 --> 03:25:44,649
I don't...

2539
03:25:44,649 --> 03:25:47,389
I never do that.

2540
03:25:47,389 --> 03:25:49,309
Are you going to do turmoil the entire time?

2541
03:25:49,309 --> 03:25:54,700
I'm going to assume I'm probably going to beat this in the next few hours.

2542
03:25:54,700 --> 03:25:57,790
Maybe the next two hours or so.

2543
03:25:57,790 --> 03:26:01,040
And then we'll move on to something else.

2544
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:02,079
You're going to die.

2545
03:26:02,719 --> 03:26:04,239
I'm not going to die.

2546
03:26:04,239 --> 03:26:14,159
Is French bread pizza a bad choice if you want to stream still?

2547
03:26:14,159 --> 03:26:17,469
Oh yeah, there's vegetables on it.

2548
03:26:17,469 --> 03:26:19,340
No, I'll be fine.

2549
03:26:19,340 --> 03:26:20,540
Get the food coma.

2550
03:26:24,750 --> 03:26:28,219
Eat a big French bread pizza and then fall asleep.

2551
03:26:28,219 --> 03:26:28,940
No, I'm up.

2552
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:29,819
I'm not going to bed.

2553
03:26:29,819 --> 03:26:34,250
Don't worry.

2554
03:26:34,250 --> 03:26:35,530
Yeah, I don't really do this.

2555
03:26:35,530 --> 03:26:37,159
I never do it.

2556
03:26:37,159 --> 03:26:39,079
I'm a four to five hour Andy.

2557
03:26:39,079 --> 03:26:44,030
I guess I don't really have to explain why, but I am.

2558
03:26:44,030 --> 03:26:44,590
All right.

2559
03:26:44,590 --> 03:26:47,229
Is this worth it or no?

2560
03:26:47,229 --> 03:26:49,229
Because all the 50s are probably gone by now.

2561
03:26:49,229 --> 03:26:52,809
That's pretty good.

2562
03:26:52,809 --> 03:26:57,290
I think I'm going to do this.

2563
03:26:58,090 --> 03:27:00,649
It's never going to go below 83 left ink.

2564
03:27:00,649 --> 03:27:11,879
25 horses.

2565
03:27:11,879 --> 03:27:14,680
Dowser stops waving when you tap into what he found.

2566
03:27:14,680 --> 03:27:16,040
If he's still waving, you haven't found it.

2567
03:27:16,040 --> 03:27:17,239
That's actually a really good tip.

2568
03:27:17,239 --> 03:27:23,899
That's a good tip.

2569
03:27:23,899 --> 03:27:37,739
I have 24 grand.

2570
03:27:37,739 --> 03:27:51,899
It's mine.

2571
03:27:54,360 --> 03:27:55,479
One percent share.

2572
03:27:55,479 --> 03:27:56,920
Oh, but it's okay.

2573
03:27:56,920 --> 03:28:00,600
I have to start to make money.

2574
03:28:00,600 --> 03:28:00,920
Okay.

2575
03:28:00,920 --> 03:28:01,719
Land auction.

2576
03:28:01,719 --> 03:28:03,979
Let's move.

2577
03:28:03,979 --> 03:28:05,870
I'm going to stay right there.

2578
03:28:05,870 --> 03:28:07,360
Right in the middle.

2579
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:13,069
And also I'm drinking a lot of water.

2580
03:28:13,069 --> 03:28:15,959
I'm doing a I'm drinking a bunch of super hydrators.

2581
03:28:15,959 --> 03:28:18,379
I've got my hydration.

2582
03:28:18,379 --> 03:28:23,819
There's a ghost in the room.

2583
03:28:23,819 --> 03:28:25,260
Use the diamond for the good land.

2584
03:28:25,260 --> 03:28:27,100
I don't think there's any good land left.

2585
03:28:27,100 --> 03:28:30,139
It was all up here.

2586
03:28:30,700 --> 03:28:34,780
It seems to be spreading thinner down here.

2587
03:28:36,409 --> 03:28:43,549
So I think I'm all right.

2588
03:28:43,549 --> 03:28:44,270
Yeah, let's just go.

2589
03:28:44,270 --> 03:28:44,829
I'm good.

2590
03:28:44,829 --> 03:28:46,920
I hope I got a good one.

2591
03:28:52,079 --> 03:28:54,959
Tell me to stop doing moles after I spend a thousand bucks.

2592
03:28:54,959 --> 03:28:58,780
Okay.

2593
03:28:58,780 --> 03:28:59,340
Thousand bucks?

2594
03:29:02,479 --> 03:29:03,280
What do you think?

2595
03:29:03,280 --> 03:29:06,479
Should I spend like one thousand on moles?

2596
03:29:06,479 --> 03:29:08,440
I don't want to go too far.

2597
03:29:08,440 --> 03:29:16,409
Jeremy, you should record the don't call the sus guy at 3 a.m.

2598
03:29:16,409 --> 03:29:21,129
This is your only chance.

2599
03:29:21,129 --> 03:29:21,610
All right.

2600
03:29:21,610 --> 03:29:22,170
What did I buy?

2601
03:29:23,159 --> 03:29:24,280
What's hey, hold on.

2602
03:29:24,280 --> 03:29:28,360
What side did I buy that was never going to go under 87 cents?

2603
03:29:28,360 --> 03:29:33,659
Was it right or left?

2604
03:29:33,659 --> 03:29:38,139
Because they both high left.

2605
03:29:38,139 --> 03:29:38,940
Okay.

2606
03:29:38,940 --> 03:29:41,879
So this worked out perfectly.

2607
03:29:58,159 --> 03:29:59,840
You might be thinking, what are you doing, man?

2608
03:29:59,840 --> 03:30:01,309
Well, oh, okay.

2609
03:30:01,309 --> 03:30:02,430
We got one over there.

2610
03:30:02,430 --> 03:30:05,260
I want to be able to start making money now.

2611
03:30:05,260 --> 03:30:12,760
Okay, let's go.

2612
03:30:12,760 --> 03:30:13,319
Start moving.

2613
03:30:13,879 --> 03:30:30,000
Okay.

2614
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:33,260
No, I'm not doing a silo yet.

2615
03:30:33,260 --> 03:30:50,670
I love the moles.

2616
03:30:50,670 --> 03:30:51,549
They're so fun.

2617
03:30:51,549 --> 03:31:03,930
Silo is going right here.

2618
03:31:03,930 --> 03:31:04,649
Very close.

2619
03:31:05,209 --> 03:31:11,399
Everybody is going to be delivering to the left.

2620
03:31:11,399 --> 03:31:15,049
Okay.

2621
03:31:15,049 --> 03:31:15,930
Is that enough horses?

2622
03:31:17,420 --> 03:31:18,700
Oh, look at this.

2623
03:31:19,260 --> 03:31:20,219
This is a huge one.

2624
03:31:20,219 --> 03:31:21,260
I got to go to here.

2625
03:31:21,260 --> 03:31:24,510
This is a big one.

2626
03:31:24,510 --> 03:31:38,120
It's empty.

2627
03:31:38,120 --> 03:31:38,600
This one.

2628
03:31:38,600 --> 03:31:38,920
Okay.

2629
03:31:38,920 --> 03:31:42,799
I got to go here and then I'll go a little bit down this way.

2630
03:31:42,799 --> 03:31:48,540
Any more moles?

2631
03:31:48,540 --> 03:32:06,010
No, I don't want to do more than a thousand dollars in moles.

2632
03:32:06,010 --> 03:32:07,610
It's very possible that this is it.

2633
03:32:07,610 --> 03:32:13,149
There's probably only a couple more here.

2634
03:32:13,149 --> 03:32:22,379
The silo turned out to be kind of not really helping.

2635
03:32:22,379 --> 03:32:37,079
Bring a dowser out.

2636
03:32:37,079 --> 03:32:37,559
Easy.

2637
03:32:37,559 --> 03:32:39,079
Easy with this bullshit.

2638
03:32:39,079 --> 03:32:39,879
Easy.

2639
03:32:39,879 --> 03:32:49,049
Some of you deliver and some of you store.

2640
03:32:49,049 --> 03:32:50,090
Did you find something?

2641
03:32:50,090 --> 03:33:01,159
More of you need to come over here.

2642
03:33:01,159 --> 03:33:06,409
Got something?

2643
03:33:06,409 --> 03:33:22,510
I need to start selling.

2644
03:33:22,510 --> 03:33:23,389
What do you got?

2645
03:33:23,629 --> 03:33:25,559
What do you got?

2646
03:33:25,559 --> 03:33:26,440
There's nothing here.

2647
03:33:26,440 --> 03:33:34,799
Sell right?

2648
03:33:36,620 --> 03:33:41,739
It's too late.

2649
03:33:41,739 --> 03:33:57,549
Nothing over there?

2650
03:33:57,549 --> 03:33:58,110
Nothing?

2651
03:33:58,110 --> 03:33:59,530
What about all the way down?

2652
03:33:59,530 --> 03:34:01,600
There's got to be something, right?

2653
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:04,680
It's too late.

2654
03:34:04,680 --> 03:34:05,319
I can't go.

2655
03:34:05,319 --> 03:34:05,799
It's too late.

2656
03:34:05,799 --> 03:34:18,809
I can't go right.

2657
03:34:18,809 --> 03:34:19,610
It is too late.

2658
03:34:19,610 --> 03:34:21,100
Is there anything left?

2659
03:34:21,100 --> 03:34:25,450
Why do I keep getting such shitty ones?

2660
03:34:25,450 --> 03:34:33,450
Dowser didn't find anything.

2661
03:34:33,450 --> 03:34:35,559
I think I'm pulling out.

2662
03:34:35,559 --> 03:34:37,319
Should I pull out?

2663
03:34:37,319 --> 03:34:40,139
Would you pull out if you were me?

2664
03:34:40,139 --> 03:34:46,829
Would you pull out?

2665
03:34:46,829 --> 03:34:56,110
I got to do three more moles.

2666
03:34:56,110 --> 03:34:58,200
And then I'm pulling out.

2667
03:34:58,200 --> 03:35:15,850
I'm out.

2668
03:35:15,850 --> 03:35:17,049
Oh, fuck off.

2669
03:35:17,049 --> 03:35:17,790
Really?

2670
03:35:17,790 --> 03:35:18,590
It's fine.

2671
03:35:18,590 --> 03:35:24,250
I don't care about the shares this time.

2672
03:35:24,250 --> 03:35:30,059
I need to start upgrading.

2673
03:35:30,059 --> 03:35:30,940
Pizza's ready.

2674
03:35:30,940 --> 03:35:33,280
All right.

2675
03:35:33,280 --> 03:35:34,719
Let me go grab my French bread pizza.

2676
03:35:34,719 --> 03:35:36,409
I'm going to eat it on stream.

2677
03:35:36,409 --> 03:35:38,729
I'm going to be off cam maybe for a little bit.

2678
03:35:38,729 --> 03:35:40,909
I'll be literally back in two seconds.

2679
03:35:40,909 --> 03:37:03,979
Give me one second.

2680
03:37:03,979 --> 03:37:06,459
I honestly don't really don't want to spill this

2681
03:37:06,459 --> 03:37:07,500
or get this on anything.

2682
03:37:07,500 --> 03:37:09,319
I'm sure I have enough room.

2683
03:37:10,040 --> 03:37:11,899
What do you got?

2684
03:37:11,899 --> 03:37:12,459
You guys want to see it?

2685
03:37:13,020 --> 03:37:15,340
It's pretty basic.

2686
03:37:15,340 --> 03:37:16,059
It's pretty generic.

2687
03:37:16,700 --> 03:37:17,579
It's just the...

2688
03:37:17,579 --> 03:37:18,059
What is it?

2689
03:37:18,780 --> 03:37:22,409
Who makes this sauce?

2690
03:37:22,409 --> 03:37:22,649
Okay.

2691
03:37:22,649 --> 03:37:23,290
Hold on.

2692
03:37:23,290 --> 03:37:25,920
One second here.

2693
03:37:25,920 --> 03:37:29,899
I'm ready.

2694
03:37:29,899 --> 03:37:32,409
You want to see?

2695
03:37:32,409 --> 03:37:33,690
Oh, Pog.

2696
03:37:33,690 --> 03:37:36,860
Actually looks pretty good.

2697
03:37:36,860 --> 03:37:41,079
It's like a commercial.

2698
03:37:44,729 --> 03:37:45,209
First bite.

2699
03:37:45,209 --> 03:37:46,729
Let me give you a review.

2700
03:37:46,729 --> 03:37:47,290
This is what...

2701
03:37:48,010 --> 03:37:49,760
Who makes this?

2702
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:50,639
Who makes this?

2703
03:37:50,639 --> 03:37:53,239
Holly, who makes this?

2704
03:37:53,239 --> 03:37:53,799
Who makes this?

2705
03:37:59,479 --> 03:38:00,680
We need it closer.

2706
03:38:00,680 --> 03:38:06,600
Red Baron.

2707
03:38:06,600 --> 03:38:06,760
All right.

2708
03:38:06,760 --> 03:38:08,040
This is Red Baron.

2709
03:38:08,040 --> 03:38:17,530
Peppers, pepperoni, sausage, cheese, tomato sauce, and bread pizza.

2710
03:38:17,530 --> 03:38:18,569
Real review.

2711
03:38:18,569 --> 03:38:21,530
It's been a long time since I've had a Red Baron French bread pizza.

2712
03:38:21,530 --> 03:38:22,329
Let's give it a review.

2713
03:38:23,959 --> 03:38:24,680
Here we go.

2714
03:38:24,680 --> 03:38:25,899
Kind of nervous.

2715
03:38:25,899 --> 03:38:32,809
It's too hot to bite.

2716
03:38:32,809 --> 03:38:33,610
Give me a second.

2717
03:38:33,610 --> 03:38:40,829
That's how you tell if it's too hot.

2718
03:38:40,829 --> 03:38:51,770
If I had just bit that, it would have been a bad experience.

2719
03:38:51,770 --> 03:38:53,530
Okay, here we go.

2720
03:38:53,530 --> 03:39:16,090
And I'm going to give you an honest review.

2721
03:39:16,090 --> 03:39:16,729
Very good.

2722
03:39:16,729 --> 03:39:17,500
I would get...

2723
03:39:17,500 --> 03:39:22,459
Okay, honestly, there's a lot of peppers flavor.

2724
03:39:22,459 --> 03:39:25,950
Big crunch.

2725
03:39:25,950 --> 03:39:29,229
Actually, I'm getting the peppers, sausage, and peppers.

2726
03:39:29,229 --> 03:39:31,239
Let's try over here.

2727
03:39:31,239 --> 03:39:52,670
Oh, I swallowed that way too early.

2728
03:39:52,670 --> 03:39:53,790
Oh, fuck.

2729
03:39:53,790 --> 03:40:00,079
Oh, I hate that.

2730
03:40:00,079 --> 03:40:02,959
You know when you eat something, especially something crunchy,

2731
03:40:02,959 --> 03:40:13,309
and you swallow it too early, and you just feel it just attack your entire insides?

2732
03:40:13,309 --> 03:40:15,389
Is that a soundboard or is that real?

2733
03:40:17,629 --> 03:40:18,909
Is it a soundboard?

2734
03:40:18,909 --> 03:40:20,969
Do you think that crunch is a soundboard?

2735
03:40:23,760 --> 03:40:35,959
Do you think so?

2736
03:40:35,959 --> 03:40:42,649
It's fucking delicious.

2737
03:40:42,649 --> 03:40:43,770
It's not a soundboard.

2738
03:40:43,770 --> 03:41:18,010
Let me try that again.

2739
03:41:18,010 --> 03:41:19,209
God damn, it's good.

2740
03:41:19,209 --> 03:41:26,030
I wonder.

2741
03:41:29,149 --> 03:41:29,649
Yo!

2742
03:41:38,219 --> 03:41:39,500
Minecraft dirt?

2743
03:41:39,500 --> 03:41:47,739
Minecraft eating sound effect?

2744
03:41:47,739 --> 03:41:57,159
Let me...

2745
03:41:57,159 --> 03:42:01,690
Mine's better.

2746
03:42:01,690 --> 03:42:02,489
Mine's better.

2747
03:42:02,489 --> 03:42:24,139
That's way better.

2748
03:42:24,139 --> 03:42:24,860
They should use that.

2749
03:42:56,559 --> 03:43:02,430
Was it a soundboard?

2750
03:43:02,430 --> 03:43:09,639
I can record myself talking and play it.

2751
03:43:09,639 --> 03:43:10,680
I can play it back.

2752
03:43:10,680 --> 03:43:11,639
I can play it back.

2753
03:43:11,639 --> 03:43:13,450
That was a real crunch.

2754
03:43:13,450 --> 03:43:15,690
I recorded that.

2755
03:43:15,690 --> 03:43:21,600
Damn, that sounds good.

2756
03:43:21,600 --> 03:43:22,079
Really?

2757
03:43:22,079 --> 03:43:25,440
That sounds great.

2758
03:43:25,440 --> 03:43:28,940
Did they make commercials for Red Baron Pizza where it sounds like this?

2759
03:43:28,940 --> 03:43:31,180
Because that actually happened.

2760
03:43:31,180 --> 03:43:32,780
That really happened.

2761
03:43:32,780 --> 03:43:34,590
So like, this is not horse shit.

2762
03:43:34,590 --> 03:43:58,680
That one wasn't good?

2763
03:43:58,680 --> 03:43:59,559
Well, that was a lot of sauce.

2764
03:44:06,969 --> 03:44:08,889
You're not going to get crazy crunches from the sauce.

2765
03:44:08,889 --> 03:44:15,870
It's not going to happen.

2766
03:44:15,870 --> 03:44:16,510
Hold on.

2767
03:44:16,510 --> 03:44:20,000
I'm going to try to get a fucking crazy one.

2768
03:44:20,000 --> 03:44:20,399
Hold on.

2769
03:44:20,399 --> 03:44:21,280
This is going to be crazy.

2770
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:30,139
This is going to be the most ridiculous crunch you've ever heard in your whole life.

2771
03:44:30,139 --> 03:44:30,780
You ready?

2772
03:44:30,780 --> 03:44:51,280
Somebody has to do that.

2773
03:44:51,280 --> 03:45:04,750
I'm realizing.

2774
03:45:04,750 --> 03:45:10,719
This would be such a fun job.

2775
03:45:10,719 --> 03:45:15,760
Oh my God, I'm still wearing this.

2776
03:45:15,760 --> 03:45:17,440
What a cool, like, foley artist.

2777
03:45:17,440 --> 03:45:18,879
That sounds like such a great time.

2778
03:45:18,879 --> 03:45:23,600
You just get to hit bags of ice with hammers

2779
03:45:23,600 --> 03:45:28,399
and step on glass with boots and bite pizzas and shit.

2780
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:29,840
And record it.

2781
03:45:29,840 --> 03:45:55,520
I think I could do it pretty well.

2782
03:45:55,520 --> 03:45:56,479
Do a foley stream.

2783
03:45:56,479 --> 03:46:08,409
That's actually a really fun idea.

2784
03:46:08,409 --> 03:46:10,969
Just get a blank slate of some type of video

2785
03:46:10,969 --> 03:46:20,520
or some public domain movie or something and do foley work to it.

2786
03:46:20,520 --> 03:46:21,319
This is good.

2787
03:46:21,319 --> 03:46:22,200
It's really good.

2788
03:46:22,200 --> 03:46:25,209
I haven't had one of these in a long time.

2789
03:46:25,209 --> 03:46:26,569
This is, I would say, pretty high up there.

2790
03:46:26,569 --> 03:46:34,489
I should have watched a video or something.

2791
03:46:34,489 --> 03:46:35,129
What am I doing?

2792
03:46:35,129 --> 03:46:55,360
Like a bunch of free sounds.

2793
03:46:55,360 --> 03:46:56,799
That is kind of a cool idea.

2794
03:46:56,799 --> 03:47:00,760
Just do a four or five-hour stream

2795
03:47:00,760 --> 03:47:03,159
where you just do a ton of fucking sound effects

2796
03:47:03,159 --> 03:47:04,600
and make them sound good

2797
03:47:04,600 --> 03:47:06,590
and just release them all.

2798
03:47:06,590 --> 03:47:08,829
Just creative, what, creative commons zero

2799
03:47:08,829 --> 03:47:10,590
and just anybody can use them for anything.

2800
03:47:10,590 --> 03:47:11,930
I like that.

2801
03:47:11,930 --> 03:47:12,409
I kind of like that.

2802
03:47:12,409 --> 03:47:14,239
That's a fun idea.

2803
03:47:14,239 --> 03:47:15,840
Just royalty-free Andy, yeah.

2804
03:47:15,840 --> 03:47:21,549
Just have like 5,000 things that you'll never get claimed for.

2805
03:47:21,549 --> 03:47:22,110
I don't know.

2806
03:47:22,110 --> 03:47:33,159
Open source Andy.

2807
03:47:33,159 --> 03:47:55,319
Do foley for Nosferatu this Halloween.

2808
03:47:55,319 --> 03:48:25,440
License it for free for three years

2809
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:27,360
and when those sounds go viral for being free,

2810
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:28,479
people start paying for them.

2811
03:48:28,479 --> 03:48:31,399
We'll just be free.

2812
03:48:31,399 --> 03:48:48,000
I mean, look, if you're going to buy

2813
03:48:48,000 --> 03:48:51,040
a signed baseball for 50 bucks from me,

2814
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:51,600
a lot of you guys,

2815
03:48:53,579 --> 03:48:55,340
that's not going to be fucking, you know, you just,

2816
03:48:55,340 --> 03:48:56,940
yeah, I gotta give you something, right?

2817
03:48:56,940 --> 03:48:57,659
I gotta give you back.

2818
03:49:16,840 --> 03:49:18,040
You guys have been getting them, right?

2819
03:49:18,040 --> 03:49:23,469
I tried, my signature, I tried to, okay.

2820
03:49:23,469 --> 03:49:26,920
So way back in the day, I used to,

2821
03:49:26,920 --> 03:49:28,360
and if I was at a convention,

2822
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:30,760
it was actually pretty rare for someone to come up to me

2823
03:49:30,760 --> 03:49:33,399
and be like, hey man, can I get a signature?

2824
03:49:34,040 --> 03:49:37,469
Be like, yeah, why?

2825
03:49:37,469 --> 03:49:38,590
You want my signature?

2826
03:49:39,309 --> 03:49:42,270
I just really didn't know what to do.

2827
03:49:42,909 --> 03:49:47,399
So a long time ago, I used to just write

2828
03:49:47,399 --> 03:49:50,700
in just generic print, German,

2829
03:49:50,700 --> 03:49:53,930
and then I would put a bit,

2830
03:49:53,930 --> 03:49:56,329
like a little swoosh under the A,

2831
03:49:56,329 --> 03:49:57,770
and I did that for a long time.

2832
03:50:00,219 --> 03:50:01,420
After a while, I kind of realized,

2833
03:50:01,420 --> 03:50:02,940
I was like, that's just the Amazon logo.

2834
03:50:02,940 --> 03:50:04,379
I don't want to do that anymore.

2835
03:50:04,379 --> 03:50:08,969
It's just, it was the A with the thing.

2836
03:50:08,969 --> 03:50:10,239
No.

2837
03:50:10,239 --> 03:50:12,719
So then for Dollhouse, I was like,

2838
03:50:12,719 --> 03:50:16,000
what if I did like a big swooping J in the 985, right?

2839
03:50:16,559 --> 03:50:18,200
I was like, okay, I can do that.

2840
03:50:18,200 --> 03:50:20,040
I can consistently do like a J.

2841
03:50:20,040 --> 03:50:22,840
It was like a cursive big, like 985.

2842
03:50:23,399 --> 03:50:24,120
I was like, yeah, okay.

2843
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:29,079
And then I started doing them for baseball,

2844
03:50:29,639 --> 03:50:33,069
and I realized it's really hard to draw on a baseball.

2845
03:50:33,069 --> 03:50:37,819
And I know some of you already sent like pictures of,

2846
03:50:37,819 --> 03:50:40,860
hey dude, like the J's wicked fucked up on this one.

2847
03:50:41,420 --> 03:50:44,729
And I'm just like, oh shit.

2848
03:50:45,370 --> 03:50:48,239
And like the J's like kind of goes like this,

2849
03:50:48,239 --> 03:50:49,280
and then out and around.

2850
03:50:50,920 --> 03:50:52,920
So then I tried to change it a little more.

2851
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:55,959
I was like, okay, what if I add like a little tail to the J

2852
03:50:55,959 --> 03:50:57,000
and then the 985?

2853
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:03,600
I don't know.

2854
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:04,639
I'm bad with this kind of stuff.

2855
03:51:04,639 --> 03:51:06,159
I don't sign stuff.

2856
03:51:06,159 --> 03:51:07,040
I really don't.

2857
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:10,510
That's the best part is your shitty handwriting.

2858
03:51:11,069 --> 03:51:16,670
I'm stuck.

2859
03:51:16,670 --> 03:51:23,450
It's authentic.

2860
03:51:23,450 --> 03:51:24,170
And then I was going to do,

2861
03:51:24,170 --> 03:51:26,010
one of them was going to be just like a crack ball.

2862
03:51:26,649 --> 03:51:30,409
I was going to draw just fucked up stuff all over it,

2863
03:51:30,409 --> 03:51:31,530
just like crazy shit,

2864
03:51:31,530 --> 03:51:33,850
just markings and like hieroglyphics or something.

2865
03:51:35,209 --> 03:51:38,090
And write like in all capitals, huge across the ball,

2866
03:51:38,090 --> 03:51:43,200
you got the crack ball.

2867
03:51:43,200 --> 03:51:45,120
But one of you would have gotten it and it's not,

2868
03:51:45,120 --> 03:51:46,959
it would have been like, okay, who's,

2869
03:51:46,959 --> 03:51:47,920
who got the crack ball?

2870
03:51:47,920 --> 03:51:48,959
Because there's only one.

2871
03:51:49,520 --> 03:52:03,340
Dude, I could have gotten a better signature

2872
03:52:03,340 --> 03:52:04,540
at a little league game.

2873
03:52:04,540 --> 03:52:36,799
I don't think you could.

2874
03:52:36,799 --> 03:52:38,000
We got robbed at the crack.

2875
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:39,200
No, I hope people are happy with them.

2876
03:52:39,200 --> 03:52:40,079
I really do.

2877
03:52:40,079 --> 03:52:41,760
Every time I sell anything, I just go like,

2878
03:52:41,760 --> 03:52:42,959
oh, this is suck.

2879
03:52:42,959 --> 03:52:43,760
People think it's okay.

2880
03:52:44,399 --> 03:52:45,280
I hope everything is all right.

2881
03:52:47,840 --> 03:52:48,479
I like doing it.

2882
03:52:48,479 --> 03:52:48,959
It was fun.

2883
03:52:49,600 --> 03:52:51,290
Hope you guys, whoever got one,

2884
03:53:04,909 --> 03:53:05,950
you're a scammer.

2885
03:53:08,430 --> 03:53:09,709
You know, I will sell you.

2886
03:53:09,709 --> 03:53:11,280
I'll tell you right now.

2887
03:53:11,280 --> 03:53:14,159
If there was, if anybody ever really,

2888
03:53:14,959 --> 03:53:16,319
like genuinely, like not fucking around,

2889
03:53:17,129 --> 03:53:18,729
if people were genuinely like,

2890
03:53:19,600 --> 03:53:22,479
dude, that he like, I feel like I fucking got scammed.

2891
03:53:22,479 --> 03:53:23,840
I got scammed.

2892
03:53:23,840 --> 03:53:25,340
And a bunch of people were like,

2893
03:53:25,340 --> 03:53:28,000
yeah, dude, we got fucking scammed.

2894
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:30,479
I would be, I would be freaking out.

2895
03:53:30,479 --> 03:53:33,579
I'd be like, how do I fix this as fast as possible?

2896
03:53:33,579 --> 03:53:35,340
How do I make sure this is fixed immediately?

2897
03:53:36,059 --> 03:53:39,239
I would never want anyone to think that I genuinely

2898
03:53:39,239 --> 03:53:40,920
was just trying to take their money or something.

2899
03:53:41,479 --> 03:53:45,549
I would try to, you know, not scam people.

2900
03:53:45,549 --> 03:53:46,829
If people really thought that it was,

2901
03:53:46,829 --> 03:53:48,590
oh, wow, dude, this is like kind of fucked up.

2902
03:53:49,229 --> 03:53:52,750
I would, I would not sleep until that was fixed,

2903
03:53:52,750 --> 03:53:53,309
at least enough.

2904
03:53:53,870 --> 03:53:57,469
I hate that idea.

2905
03:53:57,469 --> 03:53:59,309
It just, it kind of keeps me up at night sometimes.

2906
03:54:00,190 --> 03:54:02,190
It's like, okay, wait, people are buying a bunch of shit.

2907
03:54:02,829 --> 03:54:05,180
Okay.

2908
03:54:05,180 --> 03:54:08,200
What do they don't like it?

2909
03:54:08,760 --> 03:54:09,790
You know what I mean?

2910
03:54:09,790 --> 03:54:12,430
I just, it kind of keeps me up sometimes.

2911
03:54:13,069 --> 03:54:18,059
Are you going to do the signed playing card?

2912
03:54:18,059 --> 03:54:18,780
Hold on a minute.

2913
03:54:19,340 --> 03:54:21,899
Are you going to do signed playing cards

2914
03:54:21,899 --> 03:54:23,899
for the Mr. Green stream?

2915
03:54:26,430 --> 03:54:27,069
Where'd you get that?

2916
03:54:27,069 --> 03:54:28,270
Who told you that?

2917
03:54:28,270 --> 03:54:29,479
Who told you that was,

2918
03:54:29,479 --> 03:54:31,719
that was going to be a Mr. Green stream?

2919
03:54:31,719 --> 03:54:33,879
I don't remember anybody ever saying that.

2920
03:54:36,559 --> 03:54:37,040
I did.

2921
03:54:37,040 --> 03:54:38,319
I don't remember ever saying,

2922
03:54:38,879 --> 03:54:40,459
I don't know who told you that,

2923
03:54:41,899 --> 03:54:43,500
that I was going to get into

2924
03:54:45,200 --> 03:54:47,760
five to $10,000 of prosthetics

2925
03:54:50,239 --> 03:54:52,879
to be Mr. Green's doing something.

2926
03:54:53,520 --> 03:54:55,280
I mean, why would you get that idea?

2927
03:54:55,280 --> 03:55:01,500
Who would, who would tell you that?

2928
03:55:02,139 --> 03:55:02,940
I don't think it was me.

2929
03:55:03,500 --> 03:55:04,780
Whoever it was, they're in trouble.

2930
03:55:05,659 --> 03:55:14,559
Whoever leaked that.

2931
03:55:14,639 --> 03:55:20,219
I'm not, I'm not happy about it.

2932
03:55:20,219 --> 03:55:20,780
Wink, wink.

2933
03:55:25,100 --> 03:55:25,979
That's the next stream.

2934
03:55:26,780 --> 03:55:27,579
That's the next stream.

2935
03:55:27,579 --> 03:55:27,899
Okay.

2936
03:55:27,899 --> 03:55:28,780
Hey, this is late night.

2937
03:55:28,780 --> 03:55:29,180
No one's here.

2938
03:55:29,180 --> 03:55:31,579
No one's here.

2939
03:55:31,579 --> 03:55:33,340
No one's, this is literally,

2940
03:55:33,340 --> 03:55:34,940
it was our, almost our number 10.

2941
03:55:35,659 --> 03:55:36,780
It's like 11 o'clock Pacific.

2942
03:55:36,780 --> 03:55:39,360
No one's even here right now.

2943
03:55:39,360 --> 03:55:40,799
There's 12,000 people here.

2944
03:55:41,600 --> 03:55:42,879
Yeah, but there is,

2945
03:55:42,879 --> 03:55:44,319
well, there is a lot of people here.

2946
03:55:44,319 --> 03:55:46,510
That's a lot of people still here.

2947
03:55:50,170 --> 03:55:52,729
I'm not going to announce anything about it yet.

2948
03:55:54,329 --> 03:55:56,170
Mr. Green's is going to do a stream

2949
03:55:56,170 --> 03:55:57,370
and it should be a lot of fun.

2950
03:56:02,799 --> 03:56:03,920
Wait, you said,

2951
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:05,120
you said so.

2952
03:56:05,120 --> 03:56:06,879
You said you're going to dress up in a big,

2953
03:56:06,879 --> 03:56:09,120
a big fat suit and paint your body green.

2954
03:56:09,120 --> 03:56:12,459
And wait, hold on.

2955
03:56:12,459 --> 03:56:14,620
You said this after you smoked three joints.

2956
03:56:15,180 --> 03:56:17,840
When did I smoke joints on stream?

2957
03:56:18,399 --> 03:56:21,309
I did.

2958
03:56:21,870 --> 03:56:24,620
Is it going to be this year?

2959
03:56:24,620 --> 03:56:33,899
Trying to make it this year.

2960
03:56:36,489 --> 03:56:39,370
The hope is that somewhere into December,

2961
03:56:40,090 --> 03:56:41,290
this would be happening.

2962
03:56:41,290 --> 03:56:45,399
It's going to shove a decade.

2963
03:56:46,360 --> 03:56:51,340
You said this during the bug snack stream.

2964
03:56:51,340 --> 03:56:52,780
Yeah, but I know it was never real.

2965
03:56:52,780 --> 03:56:53,899
It's real now.

2966
03:56:53,899 --> 03:57:01,100
All right, let's go.

2967
03:57:01,100 --> 03:57:01,819
Let's play. Let's play.

2968
03:57:01,819 --> 03:57:04,780
But yeah, I, I'm not going to give any details on it

2969
03:57:04,780 --> 03:57:06,620
until I really want to.

2970
03:57:06,620 --> 03:57:14,000
But the next big thing to do is Mr. Green's stream.

2971
03:57:14,000 --> 03:57:15,760
And just like baseball, you'll know about it.

2972
03:57:16,639 --> 03:57:19,120
You won't really know about it until it happens, really.

2973
03:57:19,680 --> 03:57:23,360
So it should be fun.

2974
03:57:23,360 --> 03:57:25,200
A lot of, a lot of ideas,

2975
03:57:25,200 --> 03:57:26,639
a lot of things that I want to do.

2976
03:57:26,639 --> 03:57:28,680
Let's see if it works.

2977
03:57:29,639 --> 03:57:38,270
Okay, I have 30 grand.

2978
03:57:38,909 --> 03:57:40,190
What do I want to do with it?

2979
03:57:40,190 --> 03:57:44,030
What are your thoughts on sherbert ice cream?

2980
03:57:44,030 --> 03:57:44,750
I love sherbert ice cream.

2981
03:57:44,750 --> 03:57:45,309
It's fantastic.

2982
03:57:47,920 --> 03:57:49,520
I wish I was in the mood for it more.

2983
03:57:50,159 --> 03:58:02,520
I will tell you this.

2984
03:58:03,319 --> 03:58:04,680
No, no more leaking.

2985
03:58:04,680 --> 03:58:05,719
I just said, all right, that's it.

2986
03:58:05,719 --> 03:58:06,760
You're not going to hear anything else.

2987
03:58:06,760 --> 03:58:07,879
And now I'm just like, well,

2988
03:58:07,879 --> 03:58:14,079
you know what else I want to tell you?

2989
03:58:14,079 --> 03:58:14,959
32,000.

2990
03:58:18,780 --> 03:58:19,420
This is a 5%.

2991
03:58:20,459 --> 03:58:26,489
I want it.

2992
03:58:26,489 --> 03:58:27,709
20 grand.

2993
03:58:27,709 --> 03:58:28,350
Give it to me.

2994
03:58:28,350 --> 03:58:29,389
I'm at 8%.

2995
03:58:29,389 --> 03:58:43,709
I still got 10 grand.

2996
03:58:43,709 --> 03:58:46,440
All right, let's do it.

2997
03:58:46,440 --> 03:58:47,239
Land auction.

2998
03:58:47,239 --> 03:58:48,360
Okay, so look, I'm going to,

2999
03:58:48,360 --> 03:58:51,389
I'm going to say right in the middle.

3000
03:58:51,389 --> 03:58:53,870
That's the idea.

3001
03:58:53,870 --> 03:59:02,459
He wants to talk about it so bad.

3002
03:59:02,459 --> 03:59:04,860
Nothing will ever match the pain

3003
03:59:05,739 --> 03:59:08,219
of having to keep the dollhouse completely under wraps

3004
03:59:08,780 --> 03:59:10,299
for almost a full year.

3005
03:59:10,299 --> 03:59:11,739
It was so painful.

3006
03:59:11,739 --> 03:59:14,299
I want to just scream it every day.

3007
03:59:15,420 --> 03:59:18,459
But I think it made that show way more fun.

3008
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:35,159
No more, no more leaking and no more moles.

3009
03:59:35,159 --> 03:59:44,520
Okay, not a bad start.

3010
03:59:44,520 --> 03:59:46,969
This is right here.

3011
03:59:46,969 --> 03:59:47,469
Perfect.

3012
03:59:51,549 --> 03:59:52,750
I need to make some cash.

3013
03:59:52,750 --> 03:59:53,870
Let's go right side.

3014
03:59:53,870 --> 03:59:59,399
I'm not going to upgrade this pipe yet.

3015
03:59:59,399 --> 04:00:02,459
It's probably a bad idea.

3016
04:00:02,940 --> 04:00:03,659
All right, right here.

3017
04:00:08,959 --> 04:00:12,959
All right, let's get some, go left.

3018
04:00:14,909 --> 04:00:18,239
Yeah, yeah.

3019
04:00:18,239 --> 04:00:23,309
I just don't want this to overflow.

3020
04:00:24,030 --> 04:00:27,229
Which it really shouldn't because it's only level, what?

3021
04:00:27,229 --> 04:00:29,469
Level two or level one.

3022
04:00:29,469 --> 04:00:32,579
Go right.

3023
04:00:33,200 --> 04:00:38,090
Once I get about two grand is when I can really start to do some stuff.

3024
04:00:40,079 --> 04:00:41,360
Well, I'm not going to do anything yet.

3025
04:00:42,079 --> 04:00:46,299
Over a dollar, man.

3026
04:00:46,299 --> 04:00:56,989
Okay, so now stay on the right.

3027
04:00:56,989 --> 04:00:58,350
There's no reason to stop.

3028
04:00:58,350 --> 04:01:01,680
Upgrade the vans.

3029
04:01:02,319 --> 04:01:07,260
Okay, let's get it now.

3030
04:01:07,979 --> 04:01:15,180
Bulls remind me to upgrade the moles after this.

3031
04:01:15,180 --> 04:01:21,819
All right, hold it, hold it.

3032
04:01:21,819 --> 04:01:36,030
All right, straight down, which I think I'm just going to do another one.

3033
04:01:36,030 --> 04:01:42,040
All right, let's upgrade these.

3034
04:01:42,680 --> 04:02:03,329
Okay.

3035
04:02:04,190 --> 04:02:07,549
Should I sell holes, moles, moles?

3036
04:02:07,549 --> 04:02:09,120
Oh, shit.

3037
04:02:09,120 --> 04:02:10,670
This is a huge one, too.

3038
04:02:10,670 --> 04:02:11,950
I'll connect this one down there.

3039
04:02:11,950 --> 04:02:14,479
67.

3040
04:02:14,479 --> 04:02:14,879
That's not up.

3041
04:02:14,879 --> 04:02:16,889
That's not terrible.

3042
04:02:16,889 --> 04:02:18,010
It's not great either.

3043
04:02:23,629 --> 04:02:24,350
Need money, though.

3044
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:26,500
Come on.

3045
04:02:27,059 --> 04:02:30,540
71, 69.

3046
04:02:30,540 --> 04:02:31,899
Come on, 70, 70 cents.

3047
04:02:32,540 --> 04:02:43,069
70 cents.

3048
04:02:43,069 --> 04:02:43,629
God damn it.

3049
04:02:44,879 --> 04:02:45,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

3050
04:02:46,850 --> 04:02:47,889
Right, not right side yet.

3051
04:02:48,450 --> 04:02:55,729
Yeah, this is a big one.

3052
04:02:55,729 --> 04:02:56,690
Let's double drain it.

3053
04:02:57,329 --> 04:03:15,579
Okay, double drain incoming moles out here.

3054
04:03:15,579 --> 04:03:25,200
That has 90.

3055
04:03:25,200 --> 04:03:26,399
I'm doing right side.

3056
04:03:26,399 --> 04:03:35,120
Close enough.

3057
04:03:35,120 --> 04:03:56,159
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3058
04:03:56,159 --> 04:03:56,799
Let's do them all.

3059
04:03:56,799 --> 04:03:57,840
Just get them all out here.

3060
04:03:57,840 --> 04:04:04,860
Okay, well, this can go this way and this can go this way.

3061
04:04:04,860 --> 04:04:08,530
All right, sell.

3062
04:04:12,850 --> 04:04:21,780
Yeah, is there anything else down here?

3063
04:04:21,780 --> 04:04:25,420
What are you going to be for Halloween?

3064
04:04:27,360 --> 04:04:29,040
A ninja.

3065
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:40,739
Is it even worth doing this?

3066
04:04:40,739 --> 04:04:47,940
Yeah, find some.

3067
04:04:47,940 --> 04:04:54,110
The good part about splitting this is

3068
04:04:54,110 --> 04:04:56,750
you don't have to upgrade the drill twice, which is good.

3069
04:04:56,750 --> 04:05:02,639
Although I know how much it really is left.

3070
04:05:02,639 --> 04:05:10,590
Should I upgrade the dowsers?

3071
04:05:10,590 --> 04:05:12,270
I feel like I haven't really been doing it at all.

3072
04:05:12,829 --> 04:05:15,760
This might be it.

3073
04:05:15,760 --> 04:05:18,860
November.

3074
04:05:18,860 --> 04:05:19,950
This is probably it.

3075
04:05:20,510 --> 04:05:27,889
70.

3076
04:05:27,889 --> 04:05:29,010
Yes, yeah, I got it.

3077
04:05:29,010 --> 04:05:29,649
Let's get out of here.

3078
04:05:30,370 --> 04:05:40,290
Sell it.

3079
04:05:40,290 --> 04:05:41,489
All right, is there anything else?

3080
04:05:42,350 --> 04:05:43,469
I don't think so.

3081
04:05:43,469 --> 04:05:46,219
I mean, I guess I could check here.

3082
04:05:47,020 --> 04:05:48,000
I think it's empty.

3083
04:05:50,399 --> 04:05:51,760
Zero planning, Andy.

3084
04:05:51,760 --> 04:05:52,239
What do you mean?

3085
04:05:53,600 --> 04:05:54,239
I got it all.

3086
04:05:54,879 --> 04:05:57,309
Yeah, I want zero planning, Andy.

3087
04:05:57,309 --> 04:05:57,629
I'm good.

3088
04:05:58,190 --> 04:06:00,030
I'm going to get the bonus too.

3089
04:06:00,030 --> 04:06:02,590
15 grand.

3090
04:06:02,590 --> 04:06:04,739
Oops, sorry.

3091
04:06:07,540 --> 04:06:11,299
Also too, you guys have had about 10 hours to hear this.

3092
04:06:13,459 --> 04:06:15,139
Is the audio actually better?

3093
04:06:15,139 --> 04:06:16,579
Is this mic, is this better?

3094
04:06:18,129 --> 04:06:19,010
Are we happy with this?

3095
04:06:19,729 --> 04:06:20,770
Is everybody think this is good?

3096
04:06:22,540 --> 04:06:22,780
Yeah.

3097
04:06:23,420 --> 04:06:25,329
Okay, cool.

3098
04:06:26,049 --> 04:06:27,329
Perfect.

3099
04:06:27,329 --> 04:06:28,209
It's so much better.

3100
04:06:28,850 --> 04:06:30,879
All right, that makes me happy.

3101
04:06:34,739 --> 04:06:35,940
Stock auction again.

3102
04:06:35,940 --> 04:06:37,299
I don't think I want to participate.

3103
04:06:39,870 --> 04:06:40,590
I want more money.

3104
04:06:41,149 --> 04:06:42,350
I already have 8% of the shares.

3105
04:06:42,350 --> 04:06:43,309
That'd be fine.

3106
04:06:43,309 --> 04:06:52,299
I mean, they're all going to be bad, but I'll try this one.

3107
04:06:52,860 --> 04:06:54,639
Never mind.

3108
04:06:54,639 --> 04:06:57,180
I guess I'll take the terrible one.

3109
04:06:57,819 --> 04:07:01,069
This is the end of the desert.

3110
04:07:08,430 --> 04:07:09,069
48%?

3111
04:07:09,069 --> 04:07:10,190
No, no, no, 4%.

3112
04:07:16,180 --> 04:07:17,299
This guy's going to buy it.

3113
04:07:17,299 --> 04:07:17,700
That's me.

3114
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:20,079
Hold on.

3115
04:07:20,079 --> 04:07:21,840
I can just wait till it gets all the way down.

3116
04:07:21,840 --> 04:07:22,559
They don't have any money.

3117
04:07:28,739 --> 04:07:30,500
Okay, thanks for the 4%.

3118
04:07:30,500 --> 04:07:31,780
I got 12% now.

3119
04:07:31,780 --> 04:07:33,329
That's perfect.

3120
04:07:33,329 --> 04:07:34,690
That was me up there.

3121
04:07:34,690 --> 04:07:37,469
I got money.

3122
04:07:37,469 --> 04:07:57,549
I'm in a good spot.

3123
04:07:57,549 --> 04:08:02,020
Again, over here.

3124
04:08:02,020 --> 04:08:04,770
Pretty big one on the left.

3125
04:08:07,420 --> 04:08:08,059
All right.

3126
04:08:08,059 --> 04:08:25,709
I can just barely make it.

3127
04:08:26,579 --> 04:08:27,299
Need coffee?

3128
04:08:28,500 --> 04:08:29,940
Don't drink too much coffee too late, though.

3129
04:08:30,579 --> 04:08:31,299
It's actually really...

3130
04:08:32,020 --> 04:08:33,379
I didn't have too much caffeine too late.

3131
04:08:38,299 --> 04:08:38,860
Really?

3132
04:08:38,860 --> 04:08:40,299
Right when the price goes down.

3133
04:08:40,299 --> 04:09:03,299
I'm just going to farm this for a second.

3134
04:09:03,299 --> 04:09:04,420
Whoa!

3135
04:09:04,420 --> 04:09:05,299
Left side.

3136
04:09:05,299 --> 04:09:19,920
Get to about two grand.

3137
04:09:19,920 --> 04:09:20,420
All right.

3138
04:09:21,780 --> 04:09:22,579
There was one over here.

3139
04:09:23,139 --> 04:09:24,020
This is a little one, though.

3140
04:09:35,819 --> 04:09:37,260
I'm obsessed with the moles.

3141
04:09:37,260 --> 04:10:03,540
One there.

3142
04:10:03,540 --> 04:10:04,040
All right.

3143
04:10:05,299 --> 04:10:16,000
Right side.

3144
04:10:16,000 --> 04:10:16,879
Left side.

3145
04:10:37,260 --> 04:10:38,479
Now.

3146
04:10:38,479 --> 04:10:40,000
You need to go this way.

3147
04:10:44,690 --> 04:10:45,170
Straight down.

3148
04:10:45,729 --> 04:10:49,120
Can you put your channel on television

3149
04:10:49,120 --> 04:10:50,879
so I can watch with my parents out in the living room?

3150
04:10:52,700 --> 04:10:53,420
Go get the app.

3151
04:10:53,420 --> 04:10:55,620
There's a TV app.

3152
04:10:55,620 --> 04:10:56,739
You can put it on TV.

3153
04:10:56,739 --> 04:10:57,700
It's on Apple TV.

3154
04:10:57,700 --> 04:10:58,500
It's on Xbox.

3155
04:10:58,500 --> 04:10:59,459
It's on PlayStation.

3156
04:10:59,459 --> 04:11:00,579
You can put it on TV.

3157
04:11:00,579 --> 04:11:14,260
All right.

3158
04:11:14,260 --> 04:11:14,979
Good find.

3159
04:11:14,979 --> 04:11:28,420
Okay.

3160
04:11:28,420 --> 04:11:30,979
Stop delivering.

3161
04:11:30,979 --> 04:11:31,299
Okay.

3162
04:11:31,299 --> 04:11:32,020
Start storing.

3163
04:11:33,180 --> 04:11:34,139
September.

3164
04:11:34,139 --> 04:11:38,399
All right.

3165
04:11:38,399 --> 04:11:39,520
Get the storage up.

3166
04:11:39,520 --> 04:11:41,649
I don't know if there's anything else over here.

3167
04:11:42,209 --> 04:11:51,899
It's probably upgraded.

3168
04:11:51,899 --> 04:11:52,459
Yep.

3169
04:11:52,459 --> 04:11:58,590
Store it.

3170
04:11:58,590 --> 04:11:59,790
Store it to the very end.

3171
04:11:59,790 --> 04:12:05,579
Here we go.

3172
04:12:05,579 --> 04:12:06,059
Check this out.

3173
04:12:06,059 --> 04:12:06,700
This is going to be huge.

3174
04:12:07,819 --> 04:12:09,180
$1.30 or $40.

3175
04:12:09,180 --> 04:12:14,129
Come on.

3176
04:12:14,129 --> 04:12:16,129
And not yet.

3177
04:12:16,129 --> 04:12:20,860
Not yet.

3178
04:12:20,860 --> 04:12:21,340
Not yet.

3179
04:12:22,719 --> 04:12:24,000
Oh, it's on the left side.

3180
04:12:24,000 --> 04:12:24,319
Hold on.

3181
04:12:24,319 --> 04:12:24,879
No, no, no, no.

3182
04:12:24,879 --> 04:12:25,280
Not yet.

3183
04:12:25,280 --> 04:12:25,920
Not yet.

3184
04:12:25,920 --> 04:12:31,379
Not yet.

3185
04:12:31,379 --> 04:12:32,100
Nope.

3186
04:12:32,100 --> 04:12:41,709
There's no more.

3187
04:12:41,709 --> 04:12:42,989
There's definitely no more.

3188
04:12:42,989 --> 04:12:43,629
That's a good haul.

3189
04:12:48,020 --> 04:12:49,540
Even if I missed it, it's too bad.

3190
04:12:49,540 --> 04:12:51,020
I just want to know.

3191
04:12:51,020 --> 04:12:51,819
Send a mole over there.

3192
04:12:51,819 --> 04:12:54,930
There's nothing else.

3193
04:12:54,930 --> 04:12:55,430
All right.

3194
04:12:58,829 --> 04:12:59,329
Yeah.

3195
04:12:59,329 --> 04:13:00,110
Give me that bonus.

3196
04:13:02,139 --> 04:13:07,409
$18,000.

3197
04:13:07,409 --> 04:13:09,010
You want to know where the gas is?

3198
04:13:09,010 --> 04:13:10,850
I'll drain my moles to sniff it out.

3199
04:13:10,850 --> 04:13:11,350
Gas.

3200
04:13:12,239 --> 04:13:15,120
Buy my new machinery to use gas to your advantage.

3201
04:13:15,840 --> 04:13:17,219
We move it again this time.

3202
04:13:17,219 --> 04:13:20,500
We're going to the plains which has the profitable but tricky natural gas.

3203
04:13:24,440 --> 04:13:25,319
Nope.

3204
04:13:25,319 --> 04:13:25,799
Not yet.

3205
04:13:26,600 --> 04:13:27,399
We're using a diamond.

3206
04:13:29,989 --> 04:13:32,309
Gas is not worth much if you let it escape through a rig.

3207
04:13:32,870 --> 04:13:35,350
Be sure to close valves to direct it.

3208
04:13:35,909 --> 04:13:42,479
Before you can sell gas to a company, visit Fred and buy the left link or right link upgrade first.

3209
04:13:45,889 --> 04:13:46,690
Oh, Jesus.

3210
04:13:46,690 --> 04:13:47,329
Really?

3211
04:13:47,329 --> 04:13:53,059
Let me do this first.

3212
04:13:55,090 --> 04:13:56,280
All right.

3213
04:13:56,280 --> 04:13:58,680
Point me in the direction of a insane.

3214
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:02,399
Oh, that's good.

3215
04:14:03,989 --> 04:14:04,389
Right.

3216
04:14:04,389 --> 04:14:04,709
Okay.

3217
04:14:04,709 --> 04:14:05,989
So right ink.

3218
04:14:09,879 --> 04:14:10,280
Okay.

3219
04:14:10,280 --> 04:14:11,159
Right ink.

3220
04:14:11,159 --> 04:14:13,860
Upgrade the moles.

3221
04:14:13,860 --> 04:14:19,159
What about this though?

3222
04:14:19,159 --> 04:14:21,719
Moles will look for gas near every cell they uncover.

3223
04:14:23,569 --> 04:14:25,409
Do I need a different thing to upgrade it?

3224
04:14:26,500 --> 04:14:27,459
Or do I pull it out?

3225
04:14:28,180 --> 04:14:36,819
Why does he look away every time chat erupts?

3226
04:14:37,379 --> 04:14:40,579
It's the natural order of my head movement to the screen.

3227
04:14:40,579 --> 04:14:45,639
You need the connector for 30k.

3228
04:14:53,030 --> 04:14:56,129
What else is available?

3229
04:15:02,069 --> 04:15:02,569
Oh.

3230
04:15:03,110 --> 04:15:03,969
Okay.

3231
04:15:03,969 --> 04:15:05,329
So it's from the bottom.

3232
04:15:05,329 --> 04:15:09,440
I don't have enough money.

3233
04:15:09,440 --> 04:15:10,639
I could take a loan out.

3234
04:15:10,639 --> 04:15:13,350
I'm taking a loan out.

3235
04:15:13,350 --> 04:15:25,190
I'm taking out a loan.

3236
04:15:25,190 --> 04:15:39,909
Because remember, I got that guy to tell me where the best place was because I gave him a diamond.

3237
04:15:43,829 --> 04:15:46,469
And remember, I bought this too.

3238
04:15:46,469 --> 04:15:50,920
So if there's gas down there, I want to be able to get it.

3239
04:15:50,920 --> 04:15:57,639
We're doing right link because the right one is the one that is at 80 something cents.

3240
04:15:57,639 --> 04:15:59,329
All right.

3241
04:15:59,329 --> 04:16:00,370
So just don't lose.

3242
04:16:01,010 --> 04:16:03,200
I'm not doing the stock.

3243
04:16:03,200 --> 04:16:06,959
Unless it's, I mean, why 5%?

3244
04:16:08,770 --> 04:16:12,979
No, I'm not doing it.

3245
04:16:12,979 --> 04:16:13,540
All right.

3246
04:16:13,540 --> 04:16:15,219
So I got enough to go for it.

3247
04:16:17,139 --> 04:16:18,579
Wait, I have to do that.

3248
04:16:18,579 --> 04:16:19,139
Oh, shit.

3249
04:16:19,139 --> 04:16:19,940
I have to do this.

3250
04:16:26,899 --> 04:16:28,260
What if they're stupid and they didn't buy it?

3251
04:16:29,059 --> 04:16:29,860
I could probably just buy it.

3252
04:16:30,500 --> 04:16:36,209
I can't believe it's a 5% share of the company.

3253
04:16:36,209 --> 04:16:37,329
I can't believe no one's done this.

3254
04:16:38,149 --> 04:16:39,190
You're not going to let me do it, right?

3255
04:16:39,829 --> 04:16:40,709
Oh, of course not.

3256
04:16:42,239 --> 04:16:43,120
I can't believe that.

3257
04:16:43,120 --> 04:16:44,079
I would have bought it.

3258
04:16:44,079 --> 04:16:45,520
I just want to take another loan out.

3259
04:16:52,799 --> 04:16:53,120
All right.

3260
04:16:53,120 --> 04:16:55,520
So he said that this is the place to go.

3261
04:16:56,399 --> 04:16:57,280
Right here.

3262
04:16:57,280 --> 04:17:01,989
All right.

3263
04:17:01,989 --> 04:17:02,790
They don't even care.

3264
04:17:02,790 --> 04:17:03,909
I got the insider info.

3265
04:17:04,549 --> 04:17:05,989
So there's apparently a shitload of stuff here.

3266
04:17:05,989 --> 04:17:06,950
This is probably a huge one.

3267
04:17:07,510 --> 04:17:09,270
Okay.

3268
04:17:09,270 --> 04:17:09,670
Let's go.

3269
04:17:13,110 --> 04:17:13,350
All right.

3270
04:17:13,350 --> 04:17:13,750
Let's come on.

3271
04:17:13,750 --> 04:17:14,149
Let's do it.

3272
04:17:16,600 --> 04:17:19,159
Use a pipeline to transport gas to Wright Inc.

3273
04:17:19,159 --> 04:17:22,360
And oh, no, we'll make the oil price more right than ever.

3274
04:17:23,639 --> 04:17:23,959
All right.

3275
04:17:23,959 --> 04:17:24,520
Let's do it.

3276
04:17:25,159 --> 04:17:27,399
Besides just oil, these lands also have gas deposits.

3277
04:17:27,399 --> 04:17:32,200
If you drill to them, the gas will escape with high pressure and bring any oil with it as well.

3278
04:17:32,200 --> 04:17:33,239
So act cautiously.

3279
04:17:33,239 --> 04:17:33,639
Wait, what?

3280
04:17:39,590 --> 04:17:40,629
So that's a hazard.

3281
04:17:54,629 --> 04:17:55,909
That gas, what does it look like?

3282
04:17:55,909 --> 04:17:56,790
It's a good blue, right?

3283
04:17:59,569 --> 04:18:01,250
That's a major deposit right here.

3284
04:18:08,209 --> 04:18:10,290
Don't go too far so I can't get it.

3285
04:18:11,010 --> 04:18:11,729
Right?

3286
04:18:11,729 --> 04:18:20,079
Because I could get in trouble here and not be able to cross.

3287
04:18:20,079 --> 04:18:22,319
I'm like, yeah, you can't intersect.

3288
04:18:23,040 --> 04:18:23,360
Shit.

3289
04:18:23,360 --> 04:18:24,319
So I got to make sure there's enough.

3290
04:18:24,319 --> 04:18:25,200
There's a path to go this way.

3291
04:18:26,000 --> 04:18:27,559
This is a huge deposit too.

3292
04:18:27,559 --> 04:18:28,360
We're going to do two here.

3293
04:18:38,680 --> 04:18:39,799
Yeah, this is a big one.

3294
04:18:39,799 --> 04:18:44,549
In fact, let's go like this because then I'm going to go bang, bang.

3295
04:18:55,520 --> 04:18:55,840
Gas.

3296
04:18:56,559 --> 04:19:00,159
Holy shit.

3297
04:19:00,159 --> 04:19:00,799
That would have been bad.

3298
04:19:01,440 --> 04:19:25,750
Go deposit it.

3299
04:19:25,750 --> 04:19:36,319
Look at this.

3300
04:19:36,959 --> 04:19:37,600
This is perfect.

3301
04:19:38,319 --> 04:19:55,729
Companies cannot drill.

3302
04:19:55,729 --> 04:19:56,290
What?

3303
04:19:56,290 --> 04:19:58,739
Wait, what?

3304
04:19:58,739 --> 04:20:01,120
What do you mean?

3305
04:20:01,120 --> 04:20:03,829
What do you mean?

3306
04:20:03,829 --> 04:20:04,069
Left.

3307
04:20:04,069 --> 04:20:04,549
What do you mean?

3308
04:20:04,549 --> 04:20:06,159
Hold on.

3309
04:20:06,159 --> 04:20:07,840
I can't connect this to what?

3310
04:20:07,840 --> 04:20:09,489
What are you talking about?

3311
04:20:09,489 --> 04:20:10,690
Left is 126.

3312
04:20:11,250 --> 04:20:14,280
That's fine.

3313
04:20:14,280 --> 04:20:15,879
You have to connect your pipe to it.

3314
04:20:19,270 --> 04:20:19,670
I do?

3315
04:20:20,309 --> 04:20:29,940
Wait, what?

3316
04:20:30,500 --> 04:20:38,930
So now this has to go.

3317
04:20:38,930 --> 04:20:42,420
So this, what have I done?

3318
04:20:43,139 --> 04:20:44,200
Is it okay?

3319
04:20:47,620 --> 04:20:51,110
What if I go like this?

3320
04:20:51,110 --> 04:20:51,590
Can I connect?

3321
04:20:51,590 --> 04:20:52,389
I'm going to connect these two.

3322
04:20:53,110 --> 04:20:55,670
I might have just blown this, maybe.

3323
04:20:56,930 --> 04:21:03,559
And then, oh, wait, I can do that.

3324
04:21:03,559 --> 04:21:04,200
Is this going to work?

3325
04:21:06,079 --> 04:21:14,850
Engine gas is now escaping through a rig.

3326
04:21:14,850 --> 04:21:16,049
Close the rig to prevent this.

3327
04:21:17,010 --> 04:21:23,120
How much is this worth?

3328
04:21:28,420 --> 04:21:29,059
What's happening?

3329
04:21:31,459 --> 04:21:45,110
Oh, it's a, it's a buff, a buff.

3330
04:21:45,110 --> 04:21:47,190
It's like an overheal to your price.

3331
04:21:48,709 --> 04:21:49,670
Okay, I get it.

3332
04:21:50,389 --> 04:21:53,750
Oh, that's kind of sad.

3333
04:21:58,340 --> 04:21:59,940
That was so much money.

3334
04:21:59,940 --> 04:22:00,579
What a waste.

3335
04:22:01,379 --> 04:22:03,600
What's going on?

3336
04:22:04,399 --> 04:22:19,239
At least I understand it now.

3337
04:22:19,239 --> 04:22:25,860
Yeah, that's true.

3338
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:46,719
Let's store some of this now.

3339
04:22:46,719 --> 04:22:53,809
This is a big one.

3340
04:23:13,430 --> 04:23:14,870
Big money on the left here.

3341
04:23:14,870 --> 04:23:24,520
Don't let that spill.

3342
04:23:24,520 --> 04:23:38,420
All right, pull back from the left.

3343
04:23:38,420 --> 04:23:39,299
Pull back from the left.

3344
04:23:39,299 --> 04:23:40,100
No reason to do that.

3345
04:23:40,100 --> 04:23:42,549
People can go with the right if they want.

3346
04:23:42,549 --> 04:23:46,799
20 grand so far.

3347
04:23:46,799 --> 04:23:47,680
This is pretty good.

3348
04:23:47,680 --> 04:23:55,319
Okay, nice.

3349
04:23:55,319 --> 04:23:56,120
Is this even in there?

3350
04:23:59,409 --> 04:24:00,370
Is this in?

3351
04:24:00,370 --> 04:24:01,729
I feel like it's not sucking anything.

3352
04:24:01,729 --> 04:24:02,209
It is, okay.

3353
04:24:02,850 --> 04:24:18,850
26 grand.

3354
04:24:18,850 --> 04:24:19,569
I'm doing good.

3355
04:24:19,569 --> 04:24:20,850
What are these upgrades?

3356
04:24:20,850 --> 04:24:22,450
This looks fucking terrible.

3357
04:24:23,350 --> 04:24:24,229
This is real.

3358
04:24:24,950 --> 04:24:25,670
I just looked over it

3359
04:24:25,670 --> 04:24:27,270
and I'm realizing just how bad this looks.

3360
04:24:27,829 --> 04:24:36,530
I forgot that people were watching me play

3361
04:24:37,250 --> 04:24:39,809
because this is really ugly.

3362
04:24:40,530 --> 04:24:48,229
This is supposed to be a mega deposit.

3363
04:24:50,260 --> 04:24:50,979
I'm just going to go this way.

3364
04:24:50,979 --> 04:24:51,299
Whatever.

3365
04:24:52,020 --> 04:24:57,649
Okay, gas.

3366
04:24:58,290 --> 04:25:09,700
Almost got it all.

3367
04:25:11,139 --> 04:25:12,040
It's okay.

3368
04:25:12,040 --> 04:25:13,399
25 grand is pretty good.

3369
04:25:13,399 --> 04:25:22,659
I don't think I want to buy another stock auction yet.

3370
04:25:23,379 --> 04:25:25,540
28 grand.

3371
04:25:25,540 --> 04:25:27,459
Okay, this is for 1%.

3372
04:25:28,340 --> 04:25:29,379
You guys can have it.

3373
04:25:29,379 --> 04:25:29,860
Who cares?

3374
04:25:30,500 --> 04:25:33,540
I'll buy it at one dollar.

3375
04:25:34,260 --> 04:25:44,020
If you were a fish, what kind of fish would you be?

3376
04:25:44,020 --> 04:25:48,920
Who you are, the dumbest person in the world.

3377
04:25:49,479 --> 04:25:50,229
Okay.

3378
04:25:52,069 --> 04:25:55,430
Enjoy your 2% or 10, like $9,000.

3379
04:25:57,030 --> 04:26:00,770
I'd probably be an electric eel.

3380
04:26:01,409 --> 04:26:08,450
Seems like the funnest answer.

3381
04:26:08,450 --> 04:26:19,409
Moles will look for gas.

3382
04:26:19,409 --> 04:26:20,450
I think that's good.

3383
04:26:21,729 --> 04:26:23,440
I'm going to get it.

3384
04:26:24,479 --> 04:26:31,110
I paid my loan back, right?

3385
04:26:31,110 --> 04:26:32,069
Yeah, I did.

3386
04:26:32,069 --> 04:26:38,899
You'd be an ocean sunfish.

3387
04:26:38,899 --> 04:26:39,860
Hey, that's kind of cool.

3388
04:26:40,819 --> 04:26:41,860
Ocean sunfish?

3389
04:26:42,500 --> 04:26:49,250
Okay, do they know that this was great?

3390
04:26:49,250 --> 04:26:49,809
Can they see the...

3391
04:26:49,809 --> 04:26:51,090
Okay, they can see the same map.

3392
04:27:15,030 --> 04:27:15,670
Junk.

3393
04:27:15,670 --> 04:27:23,090
All right, now I understand how gas works.

3394
04:27:23,090 --> 04:27:24,850
That's what an ocean sunfish looks like.

3395
04:27:24,850 --> 04:27:30,850
I thought they were going to be this beautiful orange and yellow and fire.

3396
04:27:31,889 --> 04:27:33,299
It's been 10 hours.

3397
04:27:33,299 --> 04:27:33,780
It's going to break.

3398
04:27:34,420 --> 04:27:37,559
Okay, when a mole smells gas nearby, we'll uncover it for you.

3399
04:27:47,969 --> 04:27:48,290
Gas.

3400
04:27:49,649 --> 04:27:49,969
Gas.

3401
04:27:50,850 --> 04:27:54,069
Okay, don't touch the gas.

3402
04:27:54,790 --> 04:28:08,319
Whoa, is that gas?

3403
04:28:08,879 --> 04:28:11,030
I don't know if that's gas or not.

3404
04:28:11,590 --> 04:28:17,459
I hope this is not gas.

3405
04:28:18,020 --> 04:28:20,260
Is it?

3406
04:28:20,260 --> 04:28:20,899
Don't be gas.

3407
04:28:25,040 --> 04:28:25,520
All right, nice.

3408
04:28:25,520 --> 04:28:26,319
We're good.

3409
04:28:26,319 --> 04:28:37,170
All right, hold off.

3410
04:28:37,170 --> 04:28:37,489
Hold off.

3411
04:28:37,489 --> 04:28:38,370
Hold off.

3412
04:28:38,370 --> 04:28:46,790
All right, I need to upgrade this.

3413
04:28:46,790 --> 04:28:47,270
Not yet.

3414
04:28:47,270 --> 04:29:12,469
Hold on.

3415
04:29:12,469 --> 04:29:15,809
Sell it.

3416
04:29:15,809 --> 04:29:16,209
Hurry.

3417
04:29:18,309 --> 04:29:20,790
There's so much to make on that right side right now.

3418
04:29:20,790 --> 04:29:21,190
Thank God.

3419
04:29:21,190 --> 04:29:21,909
All right, we're good.

3420
04:29:21,909 --> 04:29:26,799
Cool.

3421
04:29:26,799 --> 04:29:31,670
All right, I think I'm just going to double this up.

3422
04:29:31,670 --> 04:29:45,809
I'm going to start to get crazy here.

3423
04:29:45,809 --> 04:29:46,530
All right, gas.

3424
04:29:46,530 --> 04:29:47,329
I got to be ready.

3425
04:29:47,329 --> 04:29:53,920
Is it going to start to fill up?

3426
04:29:54,559 --> 04:29:55,379
Fine.

3427
04:29:55,940 --> 04:29:57,299
Both dog shit prices.

3428
04:29:57,299 --> 04:29:58,819
I'm not going to do that.

3429
04:29:59,540 --> 04:30:00,340
Terrible prices.

3430
04:30:11,989 --> 04:30:13,829
Can I get something better than 70 cents, please?

3431
04:30:14,469 --> 04:30:17,059
78.

3432
04:30:17,059 --> 04:30:17,459
Come on.

3433
04:30:17,459 --> 04:30:18,100
That's climbing.

3434
04:30:22,040 --> 04:30:23,000
85.

3435
04:30:23,000 --> 04:30:23,399
All right, go.

3436
04:30:23,959 --> 04:30:34,280
Good haul.

3437
04:30:34,280 --> 04:30:38,959
All right, now where is there more of this shit?

3438
04:30:38,959 --> 04:30:40,659
Could have done the gas.

3439
04:30:40,659 --> 04:30:41,700
I couldn't have done the gas.

3440
04:30:41,700 --> 04:30:42,739
I don't have it on the left side.

3441
04:30:44,399 --> 04:30:45,360
All right, I need some more moles.

3442
04:30:58,530 --> 04:30:59,750
Good.

3443
04:30:59,750 --> 04:31:00,389
Yep.

3444
04:31:00,389 --> 04:31:01,430
Okay, and this is rock.

3445
04:31:02,149 --> 04:31:05,649
Find something over here.

3446
04:31:05,649 --> 04:31:06,610
Let's pray that'd be perfect.

3447
04:31:07,250 --> 04:31:12,600
You're going to do it.

3448
04:31:12,600 --> 04:31:13,879
Go right side.

3449
04:31:15,399 --> 04:31:21,430
Anything?

3450
04:31:21,430 --> 04:31:23,030
Okay, there's something this way.

3451
04:31:23,030 --> 04:31:25,190
There's two gas piles right here.

3452
04:31:30,770 --> 04:31:31,489
How big are they?

3453
04:31:31,969 --> 04:31:37,860
I just got a diamond.

3454
04:31:37,860 --> 04:31:46,049
Nice.

3455
04:31:46,049 --> 04:31:46,850
Don't hit the gas.

3456
04:31:47,569 --> 04:32:07,270
Jit.

3457
04:32:12,799 --> 04:32:13,440
Use the gas.

3458
04:32:15,379 --> 04:32:16,420
It has to go this way.

3459
04:32:17,139 --> 04:32:19,510
It's all just too far away.

3460
04:32:20,229 --> 04:32:31,399
I guess I could put...

3461
04:32:31,399 --> 04:32:32,120
Can I connect?

3462
04:32:32,120 --> 04:32:32,680
I don't know.

3463
04:32:32,680 --> 04:32:33,879
I guess I could connect to here.

3464
04:32:34,520 --> 04:32:35,319
Now it's too far away.

3465
04:32:40,120 --> 04:32:40,920
Hold off.

3466
04:32:40,920 --> 04:32:41,959
Hold off, hold off, hold off.

3467
04:32:42,680 --> 04:32:43,239
Left side.

3468
04:32:44,280 --> 04:32:45,750
Crazy.

3469
04:32:46,389 --> 04:32:56,319
There's so much over here.

3470
04:33:01,379 --> 04:33:02,979
I dicked around way too much at the beginning.

3471
04:33:11,040 --> 04:33:12,240
Okay, I started on the wrong side.

3472
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:13,599
The left side was so much better.

3473
04:33:13,599 --> 04:33:19,060
The right side was terrible.

3474
04:33:19,619 --> 04:33:22,180
There was two deposits and then no gas.

3475
04:33:22,180 --> 04:33:24,720
That sucked.

3476
04:33:24,720 --> 04:33:28,279
Let's get this out of the way.

3477
04:33:28,279 --> 04:33:30,200
Another 1% 40 grand.

3478
04:33:30,200 --> 04:33:31,319
Imagine clicking on that.

3479
04:33:32,040 --> 04:33:33,400
Just build more oil wells.

3480
04:33:33,400 --> 04:33:34,520
Yeah, I got to build more of those.

3481
04:33:35,240 --> 04:33:42,259
I'll buy it at a dollar.

3482
04:33:42,259 --> 04:33:55,200
Ricardo again.

3483
04:33:55,200 --> 04:33:55,919
All right, that's fine.

3484
04:34:02,159 --> 04:34:03,919
Maybe upgrade the joints.

3485
04:34:03,919 --> 04:34:04,720
I could do three.

3486
04:34:06,549 --> 04:34:08,229
That seems like amazing.

3487
04:34:08,229 --> 04:34:09,029
I think I need this.

3488
04:34:11,669 --> 04:34:12,549
I need that.

3489
04:34:12,549 --> 04:34:13,750
I can go one, two, three.

3490
04:34:13,750 --> 04:34:15,110
The branches just get so much bigger.

3491
04:34:15,990 --> 04:34:24,770
All right, save the rest.

3492
04:34:25,490 --> 04:34:29,520
That's a good upgrade.

3493
04:34:29,520 --> 04:34:30,020
Yeah.

3494
04:34:30,560 --> 04:34:42,689
Right here seems like a good idea.

3495
04:34:42,689 --> 04:34:44,049
Yeah, that's hot real estate right there.

3496
04:34:44,049 --> 04:34:44,849
Come on, dude.

3497
04:34:44,849 --> 04:34:45,569
Really?

3498
04:34:45,569 --> 04:34:46,130
I don't want that.

3499
04:34:46,849 --> 04:34:51,250
All right, I'm good.

3500
04:34:53,080 --> 04:34:55,240
All right, I can do three branches now.

3501
04:34:55,240 --> 04:34:58,340
I want to take my pants off so bad.

3502
04:34:58,340 --> 04:34:58,900
You have no idea.

3503
04:34:59,540 --> 04:35:00,180
Just sit here.

3504
04:35:01,490 --> 04:35:05,569
You can now connect five pipes to each joint.

3505
04:35:06,290 --> 04:35:27,889
Perfect place for gas right there.

3506
04:35:27,889 --> 04:35:28,689
This is a big one.

3507
04:35:30,319 --> 04:35:31,200
All right, I got to plan this out.

3508
04:35:31,200 --> 04:35:32,080
This is a big one.

3509
04:35:32,080 --> 04:35:33,200
Look at how huge this one is.

3510
04:35:33,680 --> 04:35:36,549
So I'm thinking bang, right?

3511
04:35:36,549 --> 04:35:37,270
Like right here.

3512
04:35:39,110 --> 04:35:43,590
Yeah, so it's going to go bang right here.

3513
04:35:45,060 --> 04:35:46,479
Wait, wait.

3514
04:35:47,119 --> 04:35:52,689
Okay, so should I go short and then be able to have...

3515
04:35:52,689 --> 04:35:55,619
Okay, so listen, should I go...

3516
04:35:56,180 --> 04:35:57,860
Just don't go all the way down.

3517
04:35:57,860 --> 04:35:59,880
Should I go a little bit down

3518
04:35:59,880 --> 04:36:01,560
so then I can connect three to that?

3519
04:36:02,119 --> 04:36:03,909
That makes sense, doesn't it?

3520
04:36:03,909 --> 04:36:09,380
See what I'm saying?

3521
04:36:09,380 --> 04:36:14,529
Go like this and then be able to go one, two, three.

3522
04:36:14,529 --> 04:36:15,250
That's not dumb.

3523
04:36:15,889 --> 04:36:17,700
So I go like...

3524
04:36:18,259 --> 04:36:22,470
I'll go this way, right?

3525
04:36:23,110 --> 04:36:28,279
Just kind of one, two, three.

3526
04:36:28,279 --> 04:36:31,509
One, two, three.

3527
04:36:31,509 --> 04:36:32,549
This is the gas line.

3528
04:36:40,720 --> 04:36:41,680
No, I wanted a horse.

3529
04:36:44,819 --> 04:36:46,259
Yeah, so that's the gas line.

3530
04:36:46,259 --> 04:36:47,220
You know what I'm saying?

3531
04:36:47,860 --> 04:36:49,060
This one's going to go this way.

3532
04:36:49,060 --> 04:36:50,419
It could be another gas line.

3533
04:36:50,419 --> 04:36:52,020
He just wasted a year.

3534
04:36:52,020 --> 04:36:52,419
No, I didn't.

3535
04:36:52,419 --> 04:36:53,220
I'm good.

3536
04:36:53,220 --> 04:37:09,319
Same deal with this.

3537
04:37:09,319 --> 04:37:09,880
I don't want to...

3538
04:37:11,080 --> 04:37:13,270
Be careful.

3539
04:37:13,270 --> 04:38:17,569
All right, it's about to get real.

3540
04:38:17,569 --> 04:38:26,869
77 cents is enough.

3541
04:38:26,869 --> 04:38:29,360
Start selling.

3542
04:38:30,159 --> 04:38:31,759
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no.

3543
04:38:31,759 --> 04:38:40,790
Make some moles.

3544
04:38:47,159 --> 04:38:56,549
Two people sell.

3545
04:38:56,549 --> 04:38:57,990
I need the cash flow.

3546
04:38:57,990 --> 04:39:10,560
You know what to do.

3547
04:39:10,560 --> 04:39:13,650
Let's go.

3548
04:39:13,650 --> 04:39:15,090
Everybody, dollar.

3549
04:39:15,090 --> 04:39:16,020
The dollar.

3550
04:39:22,450 --> 04:39:25,119
Nice.

3551
04:39:25,119 --> 04:39:26,159
All right, back over here.

3552
04:39:26,159 --> 04:39:27,520
Right side, 80 cents.

3553
04:39:27,520 --> 04:39:40,049
Hope I don't hit any gas.

3554
04:39:40,049 --> 04:39:47,159
Shit, there's another one right here.

3555
04:39:47,159 --> 04:39:56,849
I need some more horses

3556
04:39:56,849 --> 04:39:58,919
and I need another one of these.

3557
04:39:58,919 --> 04:39:59,959
For sure.

3558
04:40:00,520 --> 04:40:06,049
You know what?

3559
04:40:06,049 --> 04:40:09,680
Just so I don't have a problem.

3560
04:40:09,680 --> 04:40:23,060
So much gas.

3561
04:40:23,060 --> 04:40:24,180
All right, speaking of gas,

3562
04:40:24,180 --> 04:40:27,810
I think it's time to hold.

3563
04:40:27,810 --> 04:40:32,080
Let's store a bunch of shit.

3564
04:40:32,639 --> 04:40:34,520
I'm doing gas

3565
04:40:34,520 --> 04:40:36,279
and I'm dumping it onto the right side here

3566
04:40:36,279 --> 04:40:37,159
in just a little bit.

3567
04:40:37,159 --> 04:40:48,529
Okay, so how am I going to do this?

3568
04:40:48,529 --> 04:40:52,549
I'm thinking, so I connect this through here

3569
04:40:52,549 --> 04:40:53,669
to there, right?

3570
04:40:53,669 --> 04:40:58,470
If I go like that, this.

3571
04:40:58,470 --> 04:41:01,830
Okay, so this is what we're doing.

3572
04:41:01,830 --> 04:41:04,319
Everybody, shh.

3573
04:41:04,319 --> 04:41:06,319
This is going to go like this

3574
04:41:06,319 --> 04:41:08,470
and we're going to start to dump.

3575
04:41:08,470 --> 04:41:19,279
It's dumb, but who cares?

3576
04:41:19,279 --> 04:41:22,849
Wait, I got to be ready.

3577
04:41:22,849 --> 04:41:23,330
I got to do this.

3578
04:41:24,049 --> 04:41:24,849
I'm not ready to do this now.

3579
04:41:24,849 --> 04:41:25,650
Am I ready to do this?

3580
04:41:29,430 --> 04:41:31,270
All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, pause the game.

3581
04:41:31,270 --> 04:41:31,909
What am I doing?

3582
04:41:32,790 --> 04:41:33,909
Okay, this is going to connect.

3583
04:41:34,759 --> 04:41:36,680
It's going to, I got to close the valve

3584
04:41:45,880 --> 04:41:46,439
because it's going to go.

3585
04:41:46,439 --> 04:41:49,279
I have to close this valve.

3586
04:41:51,880 --> 04:41:54,049
Close them now.

3587
04:41:54,049 --> 04:41:55,569
But wait, hold on.

3588
04:41:55,569 --> 04:41:56,849
If the gas comes through here,

3589
04:41:57,569 --> 04:42:01,189
then it needs, this one needs to be closed.

3590
04:42:01,189 --> 04:42:03,349
But no, this has to be closed.

3591
04:42:03,909 --> 04:42:06,159
And that's it.

3592
04:42:06,880 --> 04:42:09,279
So if I do this, I'm just going to try it.

3593
04:42:09,279 --> 04:42:09,680
Who cares?

3594
04:42:09,680 --> 04:42:10,000
Fuck it.

3595
04:42:10,000 --> 04:42:10,479
Here we go.

3596
04:42:11,200 --> 04:42:12,659
You guys ready?

3597
04:42:13,299 --> 04:42:17,509
I fucked it up.

3598
04:42:17,509 --> 04:42:17,909
I blew it.

3599
04:42:17,909 --> 04:42:18,549
I blew it.

3600
04:42:18,549 --> 04:42:19,590
I upgraded the stupid.

3601
04:42:29,000 --> 04:42:29,639
Go!

3602
04:42:29,639 --> 04:42:48,069
I mean, I blew it really bad,

3603
04:42:48,069 --> 04:42:50,709
but I made 27 grand.

3604
04:42:50,709 --> 04:42:52,229
I've really fucked it up.

3605
04:42:52,229 --> 04:42:55,970
Oh, I could have gone up here.

3606
04:42:56,930 --> 04:42:58,209
Is there any more?

3607
04:42:59,250 --> 04:42:59,889
I don't know.

3608
04:42:59,889 --> 04:43:04,000
I thought I blew it.

3609
04:43:04,639 --> 04:43:13,639
No, I got it all.

3610
04:43:13,639 --> 04:43:13,880
Okay.

3611
04:43:14,520 --> 04:43:15,080
What is that?

3612
04:43:15,080 --> 04:43:16,119
Is that a diamond?

3613
04:43:16,119 --> 04:43:17,169
I got it all.

3614
04:43:17,729 --> 04:43:21,909
You only wasted a little bit.

3615
04:43:21,909 --> 04:43:22,630
That wasn't that bad.

3616
04:43:23,189 --> 04:43:25,400
Stop spending money on dumb things.

3617
04:43:25,400 --> 04:43:26,919
I don't even know what that means though.

3618
04:43:26,919 --> 04:43:28,439
Like I'm a dumb person.

3619
04:43:29,240 --> 04:43:35,139
Okay, now the stock auction.

3620
04:43:35,139 --> 04:43:36,180
This is 4%.

3621
04:43:36,180 --> 04:43:36,979
So I'm going to be ready.

3622
04:43:37,779 --> 04:43:45,799
I would be at 16% of the company.

3623
04:43:46,599 --> 04:43:47,669
All right.

3624
04:43:47,669 --> 04:43:49,029
If this goes under 15, I'm doing it.

3625
04:43:49,750 --> 04:43:57,330
Shit.

3626
04:44:00,020 --> 04:44:01,540
Did he buy his own shares back?

3627
04:44:19,330 --> 04:44:19,889
This thing is...

3628
04:44:20,689 --> 04:44:21,409
I need more money.

3629
04:44:22,689 --> 04:44:26,119
Only 1,100 bucks for this.

3630
04:44:27,080 --> 04:44:27,799
I'm going to ask...

3631
04:44:29,319 --> 04:44:33,409
Okay.

3632
04:44:33,409 --> 04:44:34,130
One diamond.

3633
04:44:35,009 --> 04:44:35,810
Yeah, let's do it.

3634
04:44:36,529 --> 04:44:38,720
70 cents on the left.

3635
04:44:38,720 --> 04:44:38,959
No.

3636
04:44:40,080 --> 04:44:41,119
Now it's a loan shit.

3637
04:44:42,759 --> 04:44:43,639
Get the left link.

3638
04:44:45,349 --> 04:44:46,229
Actually a good idea.

3639
04:44:46,790 --> 04:44:49,939
Do I have enough money to...

3640
04:44:49,939 --> 04:44:50,819
Okay, I do.

3641
04:44:50,819 --> 04:44:51,860
I don't want to go broke though.

3642
04:44:53,110 --> 04:44:54,470
I have gas on both sides.

3643
04:45:00,240 --> 04:45:01,200
Ooh, really?

3644
04:45:01,200 --> 04:45:03,040
Okay, no one is going to go that way.

3645
04:45:03,040 --> 04:45:05,060
They're going to think I'm stupid.

3646
04:45:05,619 --> 04:45:11,880
Okay.

3647
04:45:12,439 --> 04:45:14,259
All right.

3648
04:45:14,259 --> 04:45:18,659
Let's do it.

3649
04:45:18,659 --> 04:45:23,380
Use a pipeline to transport gas to left inc.

3650
04:45:23,380 --> 04:45:24,979
And Kyle will raise the oil price.

3651
04:45:24,979 --> 04:45:25,700
Okay.

3652
04:45:25,700 --> 04:45:28,599
So let's be smart.

3653
04:45:29,319 --> 04:45:32,819
And I'm going to stop fast forwarding.

3654
04:45:32,819 --> 04:45:34,099
I feel like it's getting me in trouble.

3655
04:45:36,209 --> 04:45:36,529
Gas.

3656
04:45:39,479 --> 04:45:40,200
Gas in the middle.

3657
04:45:40,919 --> 04:45:44,979
Okay, this is kind of shitty.

3658
04:45:45,619 --> 04:45:47,750
There's a lot of gas.

3659
04:45:47,750 --> 04:45:50,150
Okay, please tell me there's like a big deposit right here.

3660
04:45:50,150 --> 04:45:54,709
Because I could go wham, wham, wham that way and make it like $5 a share.

3661
04:45:55,349 --> 04:46:28,229
There's one down here.

3662
04:46:28,229 --> 04:46:29,029
Shut up.

3663
04:46:29,029 --> 04:46:29,669
Really?

3664
04:46:29,669 --> 04:46:50,849
When I sell to the left Twix, the right Twix starts being a better price.

3665
04:46:50,849 --> 04:46:55,479
Okay, now stop fast forwarding.

3666
04:46:55,479 --> 04:47:03,479
And then I can go wham.

3667
04:47:03,479 --> 04:47:20,180
Gas is here.

3668
04:47:20,180 --> 04:47:22,500
I could go like that, that.

3669
04:47:22,500 --> 04:47:25,490
All right, I got to find something over here.

3670
04:47:25,490 --> 04:47:28,279
I get a little bit this way.

3671
04:47:28,279 --> 04:47:29,560
55 cents.

3672
04:47:29,560 --> 04:47:30,360
Fuck off.

3673
04:47:30,360 --> 04:47:42,279
Bullshit.

3674
04:47:42,279 --> 04:47:42,599
Better.

3675
04:47:43,159 --> 04:47:54,229
Have you people seriously been watching this for 10 and a half hours?

3676
04:47:54,229 --> 04:47:54,790
Not this.

3677
04:47:55,509 --> 04:47:57,090
Only been doing this for about two and a half.

3678
04:47:57,650 --> 04:48:05,720
Okay, I'm just going to go down.

3679
04:48:09,799 --> 04:48:10,520
Start.

3680
04:48:10,520 --> 04:48:11,479
I think this upgraded.

3681
04:48:12,439 --> 04:48:16,759
There's a ton of gas so I could really make like 50 grand if I do this right.

3682
04:48:16,759 --> 04:48:18,119
If I plan this correctly.

3683
04:48:18,119 --> 04:48:24,310
I need more horses.

3684
04:48:24,950 --> 04:48:27,830
All right, this isn't going to be, this is triple now.

3685
04:48:36,979 --> 04:48:38,340
Oh boy, easy.

3686
04:48:39,220 --> 04:48:52,819
Oh my god.

3687
04:48:52,819 --> 04:48:54,180
Okay, it might be time for gas.

3688
04:48:54,819 --> 04:48:57,860
But no, it's not.

3689
04:48:57,860 --> 04:49:09,159
And what am I talking about?

3690
04:49:09,159 --> 04:49:10,200
Dogshit prices.

3691
04:49:10,200 --> 04:49:11,080
Give me a break.

3692
04:49:11,080 --> 04:49:14,400
Can you not be 30 cents?

3693
04:49:14,959 --> 04:49:15,759
Go up.

3694
04:49:17,360 --> 04:49:18,880
Seriously, what is this bullshit?

3695
04:49:21,040 --> 04:49:22,560
Oh boy, oh boy.

3696
04:49:22,560 --> 04:49:23,119
It's gonna break.

3697
04:49:23,680 --> 04:49:33,680
Can I have a gas?

3698
04:49:33,680 --> 04:49:38,159
Do a rig just for gas.

3699
04:49:38,159 --> 04:49:47,490
But when I touch it, doesn't it start going?

3700
04:49:47,490 --> 04:49:48,290
I'm going for this.

3701
04:49:48,290 --> 04:49:48,930
I'm going to try this.

3702
04:49:49,490 --> 04:49:54,470
We'll see if this is a bad idea.

3703
04:49:55,029 --> 04:50:04,369
I'm going to go for gas on the left side here in a second.

3704
04:50:04,369 --> 04:50:05,729
All right, suck up some more oil.

3705
04:50:06,369 --> 04:50:12,479
Okay, here we go.

3706
04:50:17,669 --> 04:50:18,549
Okay, it's time.

3707
04:50:20,389 --> 04:50:21,270
Let's go.

3708
04:50:21,270 --> 04:50:37,049
Let's go.

3709
04:50:39,919 --> 04:50:42,840
Stupid.

3710
04:50:42,840 --> 04:50:43,340
50.

3711
04:50:44,299 --> 04:50:47,020
I got out 50 cents there.

3712
04:50:51,779 --> 04:50:52,500
Shit.

3713
04:50:52,500 --> 04:51:22,040
I'm going bang, bang, bang.

3714
04:51:22,040 --> 04:51:32,900
I have so many silos.

3715
04:51:32,900 --> 04:51:34,180
All right, are you guys ready?

3716
04:51:34,180 --> 04:51:42,419
This is going to be fucking crazy.

3717
04:51:42,419 --> 04:51:43,459
Right side.

3718
04:51:43,459 --> 04:51:44,540
It's November.

3719
04:51:44,540 --> 04:51:45,580
All right, I got to make this happen now.

3720
04:51:45,580 --> 04:51:46,299
Here we go.

3721
04:51:46,299 --> 04:52:21,700
Oh, I didn't even connect that.

3722
04:52:21,700 --> 04:52:22,740
Oh, come on.

3723
04:52:26,439 --> 04:52:30,360
Why do I have to just make 20 grand in the last five seconds?

3724
04:52:30,360 --> 04:52:32,360
Just plan it better.

3725
04:52:32,360 --> 04:52:39,049
Shit, he's pretending.

3726
04:52:39,049 --> 04:52:40,889
I wish that were true.

3727
04:52:50,860 --> 04:52:51,659
3%.

3728
04:52:51,659 --> 04:53:00,040
I'll do it under 10.

3729
04:53:00,040 --> 04:53:01,000
Need to go to bed?

3730
04:53:01,000 --> 04:53:01,880
I'm good.

3731
04:53:01,880 --> 04:53:06,340
All right, I got to be ready.

3732
04:53:06,340 --> 04:53:07,700
Under 10, under 10.

3733
04:53:08,740 --> 04:53:24,439
Ricardo, okay, he's actually climbing moles faster.

3734
04:53:24,439 --> 04:53:27,619
And I'm getting another diamond.

3735
04:53:27,619 --> 04:53:30,380
Close the valve before you drill into the gas.

3736
04:53:30,939 --> 04:53:32,069
I know, dude.

3737
04:53:32,069 --> 04:53:33,590
It's just like when you're on a timer

3738
04:53:33,590 --> 04:53:43,000
and you're a fucking brain slug like me, I get caught up.

3739
04:53:43,639 --> 04:53:45,900
Stop being stupid.

3740
04:53:45,900 --> 04:53:47,369
I know.

3741
04:53:47,369 --> 04:53:48,169
Pause to think.

3742
04:53:48,169 --> 04:53:51,319
When I pause to think, I just go, then I forget.

3743
04:53:54,500 --> 04:53:55,939
I am going to do this though.

3744
04:53:55,939 --> 04:53:59,860
Oh, that's junk.

3745
04:53:59,860 --> 04:54:00,659
Okay.

3746
04:54:00,659 --> 04:54:03,560
Show me where the best one is.

3747
04:54:07,349 --> 04:54:07,990
Oh, okay.

3748
04:54:07,990 --> 04:54:08,630
All right.

3749
04:54:08,630 --> 04:54:10,779
This one's apparently huge.

3750
04:54:10,779 --> 04:54:12,619
Don't bid on that.

3751
04:54:12,619 --> 04:54:15,099
I got to make at least 30 or 40 grand this time.

3752
04:54:19,740 --> 04:54:38,040
My moles are better.

3753
04:54:38,040 --> 04:54:38,599
Good.

3754
04:54:38,599 --> 04:54:39,479
All right, that's a big one.

3755
04:54:40,040 --> 04:54:40,759
Gas right there.

3756
04:54:42,220 --> 04:54:43,779
Gas right there.

3757
04:54:43,779 --> 04:54:44,979
Okay, let's get this started.

3758
04:54:46,740 --> 04:54:47,380
This is perfect.

3759
04:54:51,770 --> 04:54:52,650
What's going to do, straight down?

3760
04:54:53,209 --> 04:55:03,349
Get the horses out already.

3761
04:55:03,349 --> 04:55:04,470
I want to make sure that I already,

3762
04:55:04,549 --> 04:55:06,310
I don't get a bunch of bullshit.

3763
04:55:06,310 --> 04:55:07,909
Look at how much is over there already.

3764
04:55:07,909 --> 04:55:12,020
This is going to be a big head start here.

3765
04:55:17,000 --> 04:55:19,099
That's a head start.

3766
04:55:19,099 --> 04:55:20,380
Actually, probably the best thing that could happen.

3767
04:55:20,380 --> 04:55:21,180
All right, slow down.

3768
04:55:22,700 --> 04:55:26,970
Now, silo right here.

3769
04:55:29,369 --> 04:55:31,029
That's three.

3770
04:55:31,029 --> 04:55:36,619
Okay, two of you start storing.

3771
04:55:36,619 --> 04:55:43,479
Gas here, moles.

3772
04:55:43,479 --> 04:55:44,599
Get back to work over here.

3773
04:55:46,009 --> 04:55:47,290
Got to find something on this side.

3774
04:55:55,270 --> 04:55:56,790
Stop selling over there.

3775
04:55:56,790 --> 04:55:57,349
Just store it.

3776
04:55:57,990 --> 04:56:02,700
Okay, cool.

3777
04:56:02,700 --> 04:56:03,200
All right.

3778
04:56:04,040 --> 04:56:06,599
So, oh shit, people are just sitting there.

3779
04:56:08,259 --> 04:56:11,590
Pause it this way.

3780
04:56:12,150 --> 04:56:13,130
I'm going to do some gas.

3781
04:56:13,689 --> 04:56:28,680
Okay.

3782
04:56:28,680 --> 04:56:30,200
Now, where is it?

3783
04:56:30,200 --> 04:56:39,909
All right, stop, stop, stop.

3784
04:56:39,909 --> 04:56:43,189
I hope that's not gas.

3785
04:56:43,750 --> 04:56:45,580
This here.

3786
04:56:45,580 --> 04:56:49,580
I hope that's not gas.

3787
04:57:09,610 --> 04:57:10,250
Not gas.

3788
04:57:10,250 --> 04:57:14,069
Okay, we're good.

3789
04:57:14,069 --> 04:57:14,569
Okay.

3790
04:57:17,319 --> 04:57:19,000
All right, so this is going to be the gas valve.

3791
04:57:19,560 --> 04:57:21,270
There's another one right there.

3792
04:57:24,500 --> 04:57:25,220
Yeah, fuck that.

3793
04:57:25,220 --> 04:57:25,939
Let's go.

3794
04:57:25,939 --> 04:57:26,439
Pick this up.

3795
04:57:39,240 --> 04:57:39,880
All right.

3796
04:57:39,880 --> 04:57:40,520
Start the flow.

3797
04:57:40,520 --> 04:57:41,240
Come on.

3798
04:57:41,240 --> 04:58:04,409
Fill it up.

3799
04:58:04,409 --> 04:58:07,799
Keep filling it.

3800
04:58:07,799 --> 04:58:08,119
Good.

3801
04:58:08,119 --> 04:58:08,520
5K.

3802
04:58:08,520 --> 04:58:09,080
Let's go.

3803
04:58:09,080 --> 04:58:09,720
Keep going.

3804
04:58:09,720 --> 04:58:19,849
I might do some.

3805
04:58:19,849 --> 04:58:20,569
I got to fill up.

3806
04:58:20,569 --> 04:58:21,770
Let's get another one of these.

3807
04:58:21,770 --> 04:58:23,909
It's only July.

3808
04:58:23,909 --> 04:58:27,049
I'm fine.

3809
04:58:27,049 --> 04:58:27,849
I got 10K.

3810
04:58:30,869 --> 04:58:32,569
All right.

3811
04:58:32,569 --> 04:58:33,689
Start storing it.

3812
04:58:33,689 --> 04:58:34,569
Start storing it.

3813
04:58:34,569 --> 04:58:36,169
Because I want to be able to do a gas run.

3814
04:58:36,169 --> 04:59:01,299
Okay, there's more here.

3815
04:59:01,299 --> 04:59:06,439
August.

3816
04:59:06,439 --> 04:59:07,000
All right.

3817
04:59:07,000 --> 04:59:11,240
Okay, okay, okay.

3818
04:59:11,240 --> 04:59:11,880
Okay, okay, okay.

3819
04:59:11,880 --> 04:59:12,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

3820
04:59:12,520 --> 04:59:13,319
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

3821
04:59:13,319 --> 04:59:14,599
All right, let's fucking do this.

3822
04:59:14,599 --> 04:59:15,720
It's September.

3823
04:59:15,720 --> 04:59:16,520
I got a full...

3824
04:59:17,799 --> 04:59:20,380
I got five Mega Man tanks full of energy.

3825
04:59:20,380 --> 04:59:21,799
I'm going for it.

3826
04:59:21,799 --> 04:59:22,279
Here we go.

3827
04:59:22,279 --> 04:59:23,000
Almost.

3828
04:59:23,000 --> 04:59:23,500
Not yet.

3829
04:59:25,000 --> 04:59:25,720
Wait, okay.

3830
04:59:25,720 --> 04:59:27,720
What do I do?

3831
04:59:27,720 --> 04:59:28,200
Here we go.

3832
04:59:28,200 --> 04:59:28,840
All right.

3833
04:59:28,840 --> 04:59:29,560
Wait.

3834
04:59:29,560 --> 04:59:32,740
I want to close.

3835
04:59:32,740 --> 04:59:33,540
What do I want to do?

3836
04:59:33,540 --> 04:59:34,659
Close this one.

3837
04:59:37,860 --> 04:59:38,979
I want to close this.

3838
04:59:40,700 --> 04:59:41,659
Oh, shit.

3839
04:59:41,659 --> 04:59:42,220
Oh, shit.

3840
04:59:42,779 --> 04:59:43,340
Oh, shit.

3841
04:59:44,599 --> 04:59:45,080
Pause it.

3842
04:59:45,080 --> 04:59:45,479
Pause it.

3843
04:59:45,479 --> 04:59:48,819
What do I do?

3844
04:59:48,819 --> 04:59:50,020
This is going to go over here.

3845
04:59:50,020 --> 04:59:53,259
And then I have to close this, right?

3846
04:59:56,549 --> 04:59:57,509
I go over here.

3847
04:59:57,509 --> 04:59:58,389
It sucks it up here.

3848
04:59:58,389 --> 05:00:01,159
And then I close this one.

3849
05:00:01,159 --> 05:00:03,080
And then I'm going to buy a fucking shitload of horses.

3850
05:00:03,080 --> 05:00:03,880
I don't even care about the...

3851
05:00:04,439 --> 05:00:11,209
I don't care.

3852
05:00:11,209 --> 05:00:11,770
Oh, my God.

3853
05:00:11,770 --> 05:00:12,650
I'm going to be in trouble.

3854
05:00:13,209 --> 05:00:23,869
Here we go.

3855
05:01:39,299 --> 05:01:39,779
I got to...

3856
05:01:39,779 --> 05:01:40,419
Okay.

3857
05:01:40,419 --> 05:01:43,849
I'm sure you could use a bit more oil storage capacity.

3858
05:01:43,849 --> 05:01:44,169
Guess what?

3859
05:01:44,169 --> 05:01:47,060
I've invented something for that.

3860
05:01:47,060 --> 05:01:47,459
You do.

3861
05:01:48,840 --> 05:01:50,040
A super silo?

3862
05:01:50,040 --> 05:01:54,090
I don't have enough.

3863
05:01:54,090 --> 05:01:56,220
Oh, man.

3864
05:01:56,220 --> 05:01:56,939
Okay.

3865
05:01:56,939 --> 05:01:59,099
I actually really need that.

3866
05:01:59,099 --> 05:02:05,380
It's over 2% on a whole lot.

3867
05:02:11,419 --> 05:02:12,060
Take the loan.

3868
05:02:13,770 --> 05:02:15,610
I'm scared of the loan because if I take the loan...

3869
05:02:16,630 --> 05:02:18,310
Let's say I take like 10 to 20 grand.

3870
05:02:19,639 --> 05:02:20,680
I have to make sure I can pay it.

3871
05:02:23,099 --> 05:02:24,250
Percent.

3872
05:02:24,250 --> 05:02:26,009
I have to buy the next one no matter what it is.

3873
05:02:28,040 --> 05:02:28,360
All right.

3874
05:02:36,790 --> 05:02:38,310
Should I just take like a $10,000 loan?

3875
05:02:38,950 --> 05:03:19,580
I have to make a big, big, big, big, big one.

3876
05:03:19,580 --> 05:03:31,700
This counts.

3877
05:03:31,700 --> 05:03:36,279
I actually have to get this right.

3878
05:03:36,279 --> 05:03:36,919
Okay.

3879
05:03:36,919 --> 05:03:38,580
That's a good start.

3880
05:03:38,580 --> 05:03:41,130
Really good start.

3881
05:03:41,130 --> 05:03:42,169
No gas yet, though.

3882
05:03:42,169 --> 05:03:43,130
Gas down here.

3883
05:03:43,130 --> 05:03:45,689
We put this here.

3884
05:03:45,689 --> 05:03:48,099
Let's go like this.

3885
05:03:48,099 --> 05:03:49,540
Gas can grab this way.

3886
05:03:59,819 --> 05:04:04,250
Not looking good.

3887
05:04:05,240 --> 05:04:05,880
Make some money.

3888
05:04:08,630 --> 05:04:09,830
This is going to go over here.

3889
05:04:11,139 --> 05:04:12,180
This one's going to go down.

3890
05:04:15,369 --> 05:04:16,330
No, it's not.

3891
05:04:16,330 --> 05:04:18,470
There's no reason to do that right now.

3892
05:04:18,470 --> 05:04:30,419
I know the omega silo.

3893
05:04:30,419 --> 05:04:31,700
The omega silo is going to go over here.

3894
05:04:31,700 --> 05:04:33,459
I just wanted to have more storage.

3895
05:04:33,459 --> 05:04:46,090
Good start.

3896
05:04:46,090 --> 05:04:46,490
Come on.

3897
05:04:46,490 --> 05:04:47,369
Keep it going.

3898
05:04:47,369 --> 05:04:53,849
That's a triple right now.

3899
05:04:55,700 --> 05:04:56,500
Really good start.

3900
05:04:56,500 --> 05:04:56,819
Come on.

3901
05:04:57,459 --> 05:05:02,229
Phenomenal start.

3902
05:05:02,229 --> 05:05:02,790
All right.

3903
05:05:02,790 --> 05:05:06,970
Actually phenomenal start.

3904
05:05:06,970 --> 05:05:08,009
Start storing.

3905
05:05:08,009 --> 05:05:35,180
Let's go straight down.

3906
05:05:35,180 --> 05:05:35,740
Okay.

3907
05:05:35,740 --> 05:05:36,779
Don't sell anything.

3908
05:05:36,779 --> 05:05:39,459
Hold it for another few minutes.

3909
05:05:39,459 --> 05:05:40,259
Go this way.

3910
05:05:40,259 --> 05:05:43,990
Then go this way.

3911
05:05:43,990 --> 05:06:02,150
Some moles out.

3912
05:06:02,150 --> 05:06:03,049
Okay.

3913
05:06:03,049 --> 05:06:04,330
That ain't going anywhere.

3914
05:06:04,330 --> 05:06:16,150
Nothing else down here?

3915
05:06:16,150 --> 05:06:16,950
I need some more moles.

3916
05:06:16,950 --> 05:06:17,430
Get over there.

3917
05:06:17,430 --> 05:06:19,259
Pick that shit out.

3918
05:06:19,259 --> 05:06:22,520
There has to be something over there.

3919
05:06:22,520 --> 05:06:28,790
I don't need money.

3920
05:06:28,790 --> 05:06:29,509
Gas over there.

3921
05:06:29,509 --> 05:06:29,669
Okay.

3922
05:06:29,669 --> 05:06:30,470
Right in the middle.

3923
05:06:30,470 --> 05:06:36,919
Start selling.

3924
05:06:36,919 --> 05:06:37,799
I need the money.

3925
05:06:37,799 --> 05:06:41,750
That was a good time to do it.

3926
05:06:41,750 --> 05:06:42,389
All right.

3927
05:06:42,389 --> 05:06:43,110
Perfect.

3928
05:06:43,110 --> 05:06:44,330
13k.

3929
05:06:45,189 --> 05:06:56,069
Now I don't know if there's anything else over here.

3930
05:06:56,630 --> 05:06:57,750
I'm going to go this way.

3931
05:06:57,750 --> 05:07:14,139
August.

3932
05:07:14,139 --> 05:07:14,540
Okay.

3933
05:07:14,540 --> 05:07:25,369
Good time.

3934
05:07:25,369 --> 05:07:26,250
Dumb ass.

3935
05:07:26,250 --> 05:07:27,560
I'm just kidding.

3936
05:07:27,560 --> 05:07:30,259
I'm not stupid.

3937
05:07:30,259 --> 05:07:31,139
Gas is here.

3938
05:07:31,139 --> 05:07:37,939
There's gas here too.

3939
05:07:37,939 --> 05:07:38,819
Left idiot.

3940
05:07:38,819 --> 05:07:42,840
I don't have any oil.

3941
05:07:42,840 --> 05:07:50,939
Okay.

3942
05:07:50,939 --> 05:07:52,819
This is pumping now.

3943
05:07:52,819 --> 05:07:53,380
Store it.

3944
05:07:53,380 --> 05:08:00,979
I'm getting ready for a gas run.

3945
05:08:00,979 --> 05:08:02,659
Gas run coming up on the right side.

3946
05:08:02,659 --> 05:08:10,500
It's October.

3947
05:08:10,500 --> 05:08:10,819
Okay.

3948
05:08:10,819 --> 05:08:11,700
Time for a gas run.

3949
05:08:11,700 --> 05:08:20,220
Is there any more shit left?

3950
05:08:20,220 --> 05:08:21,419
Oh my God.

3951
05:08:21,419 --> 05:08:22,299
I got to do a gas run now.

3952
05:08:22,299 --> 05:08:32,139
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

3953
05:08:32,139 --> 05:08:32,619
What?

3954
05:08:32,619 --> 05:08:54,169
I think I got it.

3955
05:08:54,169 --> 05:08:54,889
I'm good.

3956
05:08:54,889 --> 05:08:58,020
I think there might be something here.

3957
05:08:58,580 --> 05:08:59,380
Or like down here.

3958
05:08:59,380 --> 05:09:00,340
But I think I got most of it.

3959
05:09:09,049 --> 05:09:10,569
One tiny little thing.

3960
05:09:10,569 --> 05:09:12,250
I paid the debt back.

3961
05:09:12,250 --> 05:09:12,490
All right.

3962
05:09:12,490 --> 05:09:14,790
I got 20 grand.

3963
05:09:14,790 --> 05:09:17,349
I'm consistently making more money than all of them.

3964
05:09:17,349 --> 05:09:19,189
But I have to win this auction.

3965
05:09:20,779 --> 05:09:21,580
2%.

3966
05:09:21,580 --> 05:09:22,299
I have to buy it.

3967
05:09:40,409 --> 05:09:41,130
Stupid.

3968
05:09:41,130 --> 05:09:42,250
I was supposed to click.

3969
05:09:42,250 --> 05:09:43,130
I just couldn't do it.

3970
05:09:43,130 --> 05:09:44,490
I couldn't pull the trigger.

3971
05:09:44,490 --> 05:09:52,099
Right.

3972
05:09:52,099 --> 05:09:52,419
Okay.

3973
05:09:52,419 --> 05:09:52,900
Yep.

3974
05:09:52,900 --> 05:09:54,939
92 cents on the right side.

3975
05:09:54,939 --> 05:09:55,979
That's a huge deal.

3976
05:09:55,979 --> 05:09:57,259
Especially if there's gas.

3977
05:09:57,259 --> 05:10:13,689
Somebody got screwed.

3978
05:10:13,689 --> 05:10:26,700
Did I get scammed?

3979
05:10:26,700 --> 05:10:26,939
Okay.

3980
05:10:26,939 --> 05:10:27,900
No, we're good.

3981
05:10:27,900 --> 05:10:36,470
Thank God.

3982
05:10:36,470 --> 05:10:38,709
Close the well before the gas.

3983
05:10:38,709 --> 05:10:47,419
You're right.

3984
05:10:47,419 --> 05:10:52,220
The right side is not ever going below 91, 92, whatever it was.

3985
05:10:52,220 --> 05:10:59,689
That's a good place for gas.

3986
05:10:59,689 --> 05:11:00,409
All right.

3987
05:11:00,409 --> 05:11:01,130
Come on, man.

3988
05:11:01,130 --> 05:11:03,290
This is going to be huge.

3989
05:11:03,290 --> 05:11:04,889
This is going to be a big deal.

3990
05:11:04,889 --> 05:11:09,369
Go like this.

3991
05:11:09,369 --> 05:11:13,939
I'm going to go wham, wham, wham.

3992
05:11:13,939 --> 05:11:16,659
I'm going to prepare the gas lane first.

3993
05:11:16,659 --> 05:11:35,459
You know what I'm saying?

3994
05:11:35,459 --> 05:11:55,830
Let's go.

3995
05:11:55,830 --> 05:11:57,180
Beautiful.

3996
05:11:57,180 --> 05:11:57,900
Beautiful.

3997
05:11:57,900 --> 05:12:03,189
That's never going to go below 92.

3998
05:12:03,189 --> 05:12:25,459
Good start.

3999
05:12:25,459 --> 05:12:26,740
Very good start.

4000
05:12:26,740 --> 05:12:41,900
Okay.

4001
05:12:41,900 --> 05:12:44,439
I need a silo.

4002
05:12:44,439 --> 05:12:44,919
Yep.

4003
05:12:44,919 --> 05:12:45,799
It's going to go.

4004
05:12:45,799 --> 05:12:48,119
It's going to be an Omega silo going right here.

4005
05:12:48,119 --> 05:12:56,180
Okay.

4006
05:12:56,180 --> 05:12:56,979
Now it's time.

4007
05:13:00,169 --> 05:13:00,729
Yes.

4008
05:13:00,729 --> 05:13:39,110
I went overboard, but it's all right.

4009
05:13:39,110 --> 05:13:42,150
July, we're good.

4010
05:13:42,150 --> 05:13:42,950
Timing's fine.

4011
05:13:42,950 --> 05:14:04,069
There's nothing over here.

4012
05:14:04,069 --> 05:14:05,639
Hold on a second.

4013
05:14:05,639 --> 05:14:06,360
Did you hear this?

4014
05:14:06,360 --> 05:14:07,000
That was kind of...

4015
05:14:07,000 --> 05:14:07,159
All right.

4016
05:14:07,159 --> 05:14:18,119
I almost did it.

4017
05:14:18,119 --> 05:14:18,680
Please.

4018
05:14:18,680 --> 05:14:20,200
Please store it, you dummy.

4019
05:14:20,200 --> 05:14:21,159
It's $1.20.

4020
05:14:21,159 --> 05:14:28,970
It's $1.27 right now.

4021
05:14:28,970 --> 05:14:29,930
Now we store it.

4022
05:14:29,930 --> 05:14:44,360
Is there any more?

4023
05:14:44,360 --> 05:14:54,389
We're empty.

4024
05:14:54,389 --> 05:15:51,259
November?

4025
05:15:51,259 --> 05:15:53,180
Always $25,000.

4026
05:15:53,180 --> 05:15:57,860
Your camera looks like found footage.

4027
05:15:58,419 --> 05:16:00,630
Well, you just found it.

4028
05:16:00,630 --> 05:16:07,459
You're here now, aren't you?

4029
05:16:07,459 --> 05:16:07,939
All right.

4030
05:16:07,939 --> 05:16:08,819
This is very...

4031
05:16:08,819 --> 05:16:09,540
This is important.

4032
05:16:09,540 --> 05:16:10,180
I have to get this.

4033
05:16:10,740 --> 05:16:13,639
I've got the most money.

4034
05:16:13,639 --> 05:16:17,580
This is 6%.

4035
05:16:17,580 --> 05:16:18,860
I have to buy it.

4036
05:16:18,860 --> 05:16:24,220
I'm going to buy it probably around right now.

4037
05:16:24,220 --> 05:16:30,700
Like in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

4038
05:16:31,259 --> 05:16:31,979
Fine.

4039
05:16:31,979 --> 05:16:32,860
Six percent.

4040
05:16:32,860 --> 05:16:35,509
I'm at 18%.

4041
05:16:35,509 --> 05:16:50,970
I can afford the horses though,

4042
05:16:50,970 --> 05:16:52,970
but I haven't really been using them that much.

4043
05:17:03,619 --> 05:17:06,020
Bright Ink is never going under $1.01.

4044
05:17:10,389 --> 05:17:10,790
All right.

4045
05:17:10,790 --> 05:17:11,909
Give me something good here.

4046
05:17:12,549 --> 05:17:20,069
Where?

4047
05:17:20,069 --> 05:17:21,220
I don't know.

4048
05:17:21,220 --> 05:17:30,169
This is right next to a $24,000 though.

4049
05:17:30,169 --> 05:17:31,049
That might suck.

4050
05:17:31,049 --> 05:17:40,599
Maybe right here.

4051
05:17:40,599 --> 05:17:41,400
Top middle.

4052
05:17:41,400 --> 05:17:53,450
This is probably the safest place that are over here.

4053
05:17:54,169 --> 05:17:57,419
It's not a shitty one.

4054
05:17:58,139 --> 05:18:11,299
We really want to uncover right because

4055
05:18:13,830 --> 05:18:15,270
that's where we're going to spend most of the time.

4056
05:18:15,270 --> 05:18:15,669
Gas.

4057
05:18:15,669 --> 05:18:16,310
Two gases.

4058
05:18:17,939 --> 05:18:18,180
Okay.

4059
05:18:18,180 --> 05:18:20,020
I could make up literally everything right now.

4060
05:18:20,020 --> 05:18:22,250
This is going to be a huge fucking deal.

4061
05:18:22,250 --> 05:18:22,729
Okay.

4062
05:18:22,729 --> 05:18:23,849
This is a big deal.

4063
05:18:23,849 --> 05:18:25,529
Here we go.

4064
05:18:25,529 --> 05:18:27,209
Let me plan this.

4065
05:18:27,770 --> 05:18:32,490
If I go here, I can go one.

4066
05:18:32,490 --> 05:19:58,279
I need to take a loan out.

4067
05:19:58,279 --> 05:19:59,369
Gas.

4068
05:19:59,369 --> 05:20:00,090
Gas.

4069
05:20:00,090 --> 05:20:04,520
Here's the plan.

4070
05:20:04,520 --> 05:20:08,500
The plan is to go here and then here.

4071
05:20:08,500 --> 05:20:12,659
And that's going to, I mean, you could have a million dollars.

4072
05:20:12,659 --> 05:20:37,400
All right.

4073
05:20:37,400 --> 05:20:50,009
Maybe we should start the storage process now.

4074
05:20:50,009 --> 05:21:03,110
Whoa, half and half.

4075
05:21:03,110 --> 05:21:05,990
So I'm going to use store because I need to have enough for the gas.

4076
05:21:05,990 --> 05:21:13,139
11 hours.

4077
05:21:13,139 --> 05:21:13,540
Oh shit.

4078
05:21:13,540 --> 05:21:14,020
Nice.

4079
05:21:14,020 --> 05:21:21,939
Okay.

4080
05:21:21,939 --> 05:21:23,860
Should I store now in June?

4081
05:21:23,860 --> 05:21:24,659
Let's fill up one of these.

4082
05:21:24,659 --> 05:21:25,860
Let's fill the super silo up.

4083
05:21:25,860 --> 05:21:40,790
Perfect.

4084
05:21:40,790 --> 05:21:55,020
Perfect.

4085
05:21:55,020 --> 05:21:57,720
Dude, gas.

4086
05:21:57,720 --> 05:21:58,659
Three gases.

4087
05:21:59,220 --> 05:21:59,700
It's August.

4088
05:21:59,700 --> 05:21:59,939
All right.

4089
05:21:59,939 --> 05:22:00,900
I got to be ready.

4090
05:22:00,900 --> 05:22:14,939
Store everything.

4091
05:22:14,939 --> 05:22:20,919
It's August.

4092
05:22:20,919 --> 05:22:21,479
Okay.

4093
05:22:21,479 --> 05:22:22,279
Here we go.

4094
05:22:22,279 --> 05:22:26,540
Okay.

4095
05:22:26,540 --> 05:22:27,259
All right.

4096
05:22:27,259 --> 05:22:31,750
So now this is almost sucked up.

4097
05:22:31,750 --> 05:22:34,340
Two super silos.

4098
05:22:34,340 --> 05:22:44,659
I got one, two, three gases.

4099
05:22:44,659 --> 05:22:58,619
You're going to fuck it up?

4100
05:22:58,619 --> 05:22:58,860
All right.

4101
05:22:58,860 --> 05:22:59,500
Let's fucking go.

4102
05:22:59,500 --> 05:23:00,220
You ready?

4103
05:23:00,220 --> 05:23:02,340
I've got two months to do this.

4104
05:23:02,340 --> 05:23:06,099
I got two super silos full of fucking stuff.

4105
05:23:06,099 --> 05:23:06,650
All right.

4106
05:23:06,650 --> 05:23:07,209
It's November.

4107
05:23:07,209 --> 05:23:07,610
Here we go.

4108
05:23:09,159 --> 05:23:10,650
Pause it.

4109
05:23:10,650 --> 05:23:13,180
So this is going this way.

4110
05:23:13,259 --> 05:23:14,380
It sucks up here.

4111
05:23:14,380 --> 05:23:16,470
Just close this.

4112
05:23:16,470 --> 05:23:19,740
This one's going to go this way.

4113
05:23:19,740 --> 05:23:21,259
Close this.

4114
05:23:21,259 --> 05:23:21,580
Fuck it.

4115
05:23:21,580 --> 05:23:22,139
Whatever.

4116
05:23:22,139 --> 05:23:23,099
Who cares?

4117
05:23:23,099 --> 05:23:26,759
This is going to come up here.

4118
05:23:26,759 --> 05:23:32,150
I think this is correct.

4119
05:23:32,150 --> 05:23:33,189
Just close the rig.

4120
05:23:33,189 --> 05:23:34,470
Don't do anything else.

4121
05:23:34,470 --> 05:23:37,130
Just close the top and yolo it.

4122
05:23:37,130 --> 05:23:37,930
Just close the rig.

4123
05:23:37,930 --> 05:23:38,490
Just close the rig.

4124
05:23:38,490 --> 05:23:41,319
Don't do anything else.

4125
05:23:41,319 --> 05:23:42,119
Just close this.

4126
05:23:44,549 --> 05:23:46,619
All you have to do is close the rig.

4127
05:23:46,619 --> 05:23:47,020
That's it.

4128
05:24:09,209 --> 05:24:09,770
My God.

4129
05:24:23,669 --> 05:24:27,290
Oh, clean 50K.

4130
05:24:27,290 --> 05:24:32,020
That's a clean 50K right there.

4131
05:24:32,020 --> 05:24:32,979
Oh, that feels good.

4132
05:24:33,619 --> 05:24:34,580
I'm good to go.

4133
05:24:34,580 --> 05:24:37,770
I don't think there's any more oil.

4134
05:24:43,080 --> 05:24:44,119
Actually, there might be one over here.

4135
05:24:44,119 --> 05:24:44,680
One right here.

4136
05:24:45,240 --> 05:24:46,459
But I'll take 50,000.

4137
05:24:46,459 --> 05:24:46,939
I don't care.

4138
05:24:57,459 --> 05:24:58,020
All right.

4139
05:24:58,020 --> 05:24:59,900
I'm way ahead now.

4140
05:25:05,750 --> 05:25:06,869
Bank's going to be looking to me.

4141
05:25:07,509 --> 05:25:08,869
Get loaned some money.

4142
05:25:08,869 --> 05:25:18,180
All right.

4143
05:25:18,180 --> 05:25:21,459
I was a little more efficient this year.

4144
05:25:21,459 --> 05:25:24,340
My pipes were not $38,000.

4145
05:25:24,340 --> 05:25:26,259
They were just $3,800.

4146
05:25:26,259 --> 05:25:34,619
Our mole expenses obviously are pretty good.

4147
05:25:35,180 --> 05:25:40,310
Sounds good.

4148
05:25:45,159 --> 05:25:45,479
3%.

4149
05:25:46,819 --> 05:25:48,659
Not unless it comes way down here.

4150
05:25:48,659 --> 05:25:50,150
I'm pretty far ahead.

4151
05:25:52,939 --> 05:25:54,700
Ricardo's the only one that I'm worried about.

4152
05:25:54,700 --> 05:25:55,819
I might just snipe it from him.

4153
05:25:56,459 --> 05:26:01,860
If it goes underneath 20.

4154
05:26:08,009 --> 05:26:09,369
That's 3% more.

4155
05:26:09,369 --> 05:26:11,720
About 21%.

4156
05:26:11,720 --> 05:26:11,880
All right.

4157
05:26:11,880 --> 05:26:14,040
I'm 10% higher than Ricardo.

4158
05:26:14,040 --> 05:26:15,639
That's all I care about.

4159
05:26:15,639 --> 05:26:19,779
Should I finish some of this stuff?

4160
05:26:19,779 --> 05:26:20,180
Hold on.

4161
05:26:22,939 --> 05:26:23,819
Longer timer.

4162
05:26:23,819 --> 05:26:24,540
I think I need it.

4163
05:26:24,540 --> 05:26:25,819
But what else can I do?

4164
05:26:25,819 --> 05:26:30,389
Oh, 79 cents.

4165
05:26:31,189 --> 05:26:38,060
He's never going to do scanner.

4166
05:26:41,720 --> 05:26:42,680
Expense too expensive.

4167
05:26:45,580 --> 05:26:50,810
I'm going to hold on to the money.

4168
05:27:15,830 --> 05:27:17,590
Right here or right here?

4169
05:27:18,310 --> 05:27:19,830
Everyone's going to go for right here.

4170
05:27:19,830 --> 05:27:20,470
Going this way.

4171
05:27:27,029 --> 05:27:27,509
Dickhead.

4172
05:27:39,610 --> 05:27:40,729
Thanks to the timer upgrade,

4173
05:27:40,729 --> 05:27:43,450
rigs will now take longer before they spill over.

4174
05:27:43,450 --> 05:27:57,419
Good.

4175
05:27:57,419 --> 05:28:07,700
Right side's looking pretty juicy.

4176
05:28:07,700 --> 05:28:09,700
There's nothing over on the left side.

4177
05:28:09,700 --> 05:28:10,419
Nothing.

4178
05:28:10,419 --> 05:28:29,930
That's good for me, I guess.

4179
05:28:29,930 --> 05:28:39,959
Gas are already right there.

4180
05:28:39,959 --> 05:28:51,459
Hold off.

4181
05:28:51,459 --> 05:28:52,900
Mega silo going to go over here.

4182
05:28:52,900 --> 05:29:03,610
Store it for now.

4183
05:29:03,610 --> 05:29:04,569
Any more horses.

4184
05:29:04,569 --> 05:29:10,549
Geez, 134.

4185
05:29:10,549 --> 05:29:11,110
Are you kidding me?

4186
05:29:11,110 --> 05:29:12,069
What's going on here?

4187
05:29:12,069 --> 05:29:14,229
What's going on with these prices?

4188
05:29:14,229 --> 05:29:16,919
Jesus.

4189
05:29:16,919 --> 05:29:31,000
Is there really nothing over on the left side?

4190
05:29:31,000 --> 05:29:46,889
Okay, this one's something right there.

4191
05:29:46,889 --> 05:29:47,450
All right.

4192
05:29:47,450 --> 05:29:53,639
Silo time.

4193
05:29:53,639 --> 05:30:05,110
85 cents over there.

4194
05:30:05,110 --> 05:30:05,590
Sell.

4195
05:30:05,590 --> 05:30:17,099
That's a lot of money.

4196
05:30:17,099 --> 05:30:18,700
Start the storage process.

4197
05:30:18,700 --> 05:30:19,419
Left side.

4198
05:30:19,419 --> 05:30:20,700
Yeah, sell it on the left side.

4199
05:30:20,700 --> 05:30:27,459
Why not?

4200
05:30:27,459 --> 05:30:29,139
Okay, I got 11 grand.

4201
05:30:29,139 --> 05:30:37,259
Start storing two omega silos.

4202
05:30:37,259 --> 05:30:50,680
I'm happy with that.

4203
05:30:50,680 --> 05:30:51,479
Hit the right side.

4204
05:30:54,500 --> 05:30:55,380
Okay, fine.

4205
05:30:55,380 --> 05:31:00,810
It's a sure thing.

4206
05:31:00,810 --> 05:31:01,049
All right.

4207
05:31:01,049 --> 05:31:01,610
I need more.

4208
05:31:02,490 --> 05:31:08,659
I'm out of juice here.

4209
05:31:08,659 --> 05:31:09,700
I'm out of juice.

4210
05:31:09,700 --> 05:31:39,380
Where do I go?

4211
05:31:39,380 --> 05:31:42,069
Gas.

4212
05:31:42,709 --> 05:31:46,439
It's blanked so hard.

4213
05:31:46,439 --> 05:31:47,700
Okay, wait a minute.

4214
05:31:47,700 --> 05:31:48,659
It's December.

4215
05:31:48,659 --> 05:32:24,169
We're good.

4216
05:32:24,169 --> 05:32:31,099
It's a little scary, but we're fine.

4217
05:32:31,099 --> 05:32:32,060
21%.

4218
05:32:32,060 --> 05:32:32,380
All right.

4219
05:32:32,380 --> 05:32:33,900
We're almost at the last part.

4220
05:32:33,900 --> 05:32:36,939
3% again.

4221
05:32:37,580 --> 05:32:43,220
So wait, there's only 100% of the shares are being sold.

4222
05:32:44,020 --> 05:32:47,720
So let me take inventory here because I think I could.

4223
05:32:47,720 --> 05:32:49,720
So I could seal the win, couldn't I?

4224
05:32:50,439 --> 05:32:54,069
With a certain percentage.

4225
05:32:56,810 --> 05:32:57,930
All right, Ricardo got it.

4226
05:32:59,619 --> 05:33:00,180
21.

4227
05:33:03,369 --> 05:33:06,939
When is it mathematically not possible for either one of these to win?

4228
05:33:06,939 --> 05:33:08,139
I just have to get to 51.

4229
05:33:08,139 --> 05:33:13,580
Oh, what if I can't get to 51?

4230
05:33:13,580 --> 05:33:18,310
20, 30, 31, 35.

4231
05:33:19,029 --> 05:33:29,060
So 42% of the shares are out right now.

4232
05:33:29,060 --> 05:33:30,419
You land before stock.

4233
05:33:30,419 --> 05:33:32,470
Why?

4234
05:33:32,470 --> 05:33:34,950
You need a majority or a plurality.

4235
05:33:34,950 --> 05:33:49,259
They have, it's less money each.

4236
05:33:49,819 --> 05:33:50,380
Really?

4237
05:33:50,380 --> 05:33:51,259
Okay, I didn't know that.

4238
05:33:51,900 --> 05:33:54,810
Interesting.

4239
05:33:54,810 --> 05:33:55,450
All right, what do you got?

4240
05:33:58,069 --> 05:33:59,270
80 cents left ink.

4241
05:33:59,270 --> 05:34:00,069
I think it's worth it.

4242
05:34:05,880 --> 05:34:06,520
More horses.

4243
05:34:07,240 --> 05:34:12,979
Timer three.

4244
05:34:12,979 --> 05:34:13,459
No, okay.

4245
05:34:13,459 --> 05:34:14,659
So I have more horses now.

4246
05:34:15,380 --> 05:34:17,930
All right, there's only two more rounds in this.

4247
05:34:17,930 --> 05:34:18,650
Then where's the home stretch?

4248
05:34:24,569 --> 05:34:25,049
You know what?

4249
05:34:25,049 --> 05:34:28,009
I'm going to...

4250
05:34:28,009 --> 05:34:29,770
Yeah, I'm bidding you on here.

4251
05:34:29,770 --> 05:34:30,330
That's 38.

4252
05:34:30,330 --> 05:34:31,049
This might be 40.

4253
05:34:33,189 --> 05:34:33,990
Yeah, this is mine.

4254
05:34:34,549 --> 05:34:47,340
Fuck all of you.

4255
05:34:47,979 --> 05:34:48,299
Fine.

4256
05:34:48,299 --> 05:34:49,020
There's nothing in there.

4257
05:34:50,139 --> 05:34:51,659
You're going to find an old shoe.

4258
05:34:52,459 --> 05:35:11,689
25 wagons.

4259
05:35:11,689 --> 05:35:19,130
Oh, left side was the one that's going to be good for what we're trying to do, right?

4260
05:35:19,130 --> 05:35:20,970
Left side is can't go under a certain amount.

4261
05:35:21,770 --> 05:35:22,490
Diamond.

4262
05:35:22,490 --> 05:35:25,779
I want to see more.

4263
05:35:43,459 --> 05:35:44,580
Big one over there.

4264
05:35:44,580 --> 05:35:45,700
All right, let's just get some money.

4265
05:35:46,419 --> 05:35:52,040
Okay.

4266
05:35:52,759 --> 05:36:15,880
Come on, man.

4267
05:36:15,880 --> 05:36:16,599
Hurry up.

4268
05:36:16,599 --> 05:36:17,799
150.

4269
05:36:17,799 --> 05:36:18,759
Come on.

4270
05:36:18,759 --> 05:36:22,709
You're killing me here.

4271
05:36:22,709 --> 05:36:23,110
Thank you.

4272
05:36:23,830 --> 05:36:27,209
Don't shut that valve off.

4273
05:36:27,209 --> 05:36:49,029
Nothing.

4274
05:36:49,029 --> 05:36:51,319
Should I get some more moles?

4275
05:36:51,319 --> 05:37:01,619
Yeah.

4276
05:37:01,619 --> 05:37:01,939
Gas.

4277
05:37:03,830 --> 05:37:04,310
Good.

4278
05:37:04,310 --> 05:37:04,869
Okay.

4279
05:37:04,869 --> 05:37:08,900
I can do a double gas on the left, which would be awesome.

4280
05:37:08,900 --> 05:37:28,200
Shit.

4281
05:37:46,490 --> 05:37:48,729
I mean, it was crazy what I just did, but whatever.

4282
05:37:49,369 --> 05:37:49,770
August.

4283
05:37:49,770 --> 05:37:50,409
All right, we're good.

4284
05:37:51,290 --> 05:37:54,939
Not enough oil to really do a silo.

4285
05:37:55,580 --> 05:37:57,619
I might just do gas now.

4286
05:37:58,180 --> 05:38:07,880
I'm doing gas now.

4287
05:38:07,880 --> 05:38:15,900
It's September, man.

4288
05:38:15,900 --> 05:38:16,619
It's September already.

4289
05:38:17,259 --> 05:38:28,040
I'm doing gas now.

4290
05:38:28,040 --> 05:38:28,840
Let's go.

4291
05:38:28,840 --> 05:38:41,779
Oh, there's a...

4292
05:38:41,860 --> 05:38:42,099
Whatever.

4293
05:38:42,099 --> 05:38:42,740
There's a rock here.

4294
05:38:42,740 --> 05:38:43,619
That's fine.

4295
05:38:43,619 --> 05:39:00,200
I can do it again.

4296
05:39:00,200 --> 05:39:01,400
Not bad considering.

4297
05:39:01,400 --> 05:39:02,200
I'll be honest.

4298
05:39:02,200 --> 05:39:03,319
Not bad considering.

4299
05:39:03,319 --> 05:39:13,400
Is there any more oil?

4300
05:39:13,400 --> 05:39:14,119
There is down here.

4301
05:39:14,119 --> 05:39:17,990
I want a thousand bucks.

4302
05:39:17,990 --> 05:39:19,669
One little spot left, but I got the thousand.

4303
05:39:19,669 --> 05:39:24,729
11 and a half hours.

4304
05:39:24,729 --> 05:39:25,130
Damn.

4305
05:39:25,130 --> 05:39:25,770
This is what?

4306
05:39:25,770 --> 05:39:29,659
Almost the second longest stream ever.

4307
05:39:29,659 --> 05:39:30,540
Getting there.

4308
05:39:30,540 --> 05:39:35,909
Okay.

4309
05:39:35,909 --> 05:39:37,509
Land auction first.

4310
05:39:42,470 --> 05:39:43,819
The last one here.

4311
05:39:44,380 --> 05:39:49,610
Did Ricardo literally have like no money there?

4312
05:39:49,610 --> 05:39:53,220
I'll go here.

4313
05:39:53,220 --> 05:39:59,180
I'll take the terrible one.

4314
05:39:59,180 --> 05:39:59,659
That's okay.

4315
05:40:00,380 --> 05:40:05,560
2% 40.

4316
05:40:05,560 --> 05:40:05,880
All right.

4317
05:40:06,919 --> 05:40:07,959
Ricardo's broke.

4318
05:40:07,959 --> 05:40:09,319
Can I buy him out?

4319
05:40:12,919 --> 05:40:13,159
Okay.

4320
05:40:13,720 --> 05:40:15,560
If Blanche buys this, I don't care.

4321
05:40:16,439 --> 05:40:17,000
It's nothing.

4322
05:40:18,490 --> 05:40:21,209
But if it does go below 10 grand, I'm sniping it

4323
05:40:21,209 --> 05:40:22,569
because Ricardo's going to try to get it.

4324
05:40:23,369 --> 05:40:26,330
I'll go for a snipe.

4325
05:40:32,250 --> 05:40:32,889
Sorry.

4326
05:40:32,889 --> 05:40:34,330
Blanche, you have 2%.

4327
05:40:34,330 --> 05:40:35,450
Congratulations.

4328
05:40:35,450 --> 05:40:44,580
I'm saving money.

4329
05:40:44,580 --> 05:40:46,180
There's no reason to do anything crazy.

4330
05:40:46,180 --> 05:40:47,939
This is one of the shittiest plots.

4331
05:40:47,939 --> 05:41:03,700
Not bad.

4332
05:41:04,340 --> 05:41:05,540
Not bad gas placement.

4333
05:41:05,540 --> 05:41:11,509
Just need a loan.

4334
05:41:11,509 --> 05:41:32,279
This one's going to have nothing in it.

4335
05:41:32,279 --> 05:41:32,680
It's fine.

4336
05:41:33,400 --> 05:41:42,220
Okay.

4337
05:41:47,139 --> 05:41:48,259
Gas right here.

4338
05:41:48,340 --> 05:41:53,590
This might be gas over here too.

4339
05:41:53,590 --> 05:41:54,470
I don't really care though.

4340
05:41:55,270 --> 05:41:55,830
Nice.

4341
05:41:55,830 --> 05:41:56,150
All right.

4342
05:41:56,150 --> 05:41:56,869
That was a good find.

4343
05:42:29,900 --> 05:42:30,299
All right.

4344
05:42:30,299 --> 05:42:33,500
Horses are good.

4345
05:42:33,500 --> 05:42:35,580
Take some money for a little bit.

4346
05:42:35,580 --> 05:42:36,939
If I leave here with 10 grand, I'm fine.

4347
05:42:49,060 --> 05:42:49,619
Okay.

4348
05:42:49,619 --> 05:42:52,569
Now, get some mole action here.

4349
05:42:52,569 --> 05:43:03,799
I'm good.

4350
05:43:05,819 --> 05:43:06,779
Why you?

4351
05:43:06,779 --> 05:43:07,020
Why?

4352
05:43:11,479 --> 05:43:12,040
Looking good.

4353
05:43:12,599 --> 05:43:20,099
I got three gases here.

4354
05:43:20,099 --> 05:43:22,840
Okay.

4355
05:43:22,840 --> 05:43:23,959
Three gases.

4356
05:43:23,959 --> 05:43:30,540
Sell a little bit.

4357
05:43:31,349 --> 05:43:32,229
Sell a little bit.

4358
05:43:32,229 --> 05:43:41,290
September.

4359
05:43:41,290 --> 05:43:43,290
It's almost time to activate the gas.

4360
05:43:43,290 --> 05:43:58,549
Build a silo up for another month.

4361
05:43:58,549 --> 05:44:09,990
All right.

4362
05:44:09,990 --> 05:44:11,430
I want one full silo.

4363
05:44:13,259 --> 05:44:14,220
And then I'm just grabbing gas.

4364
05:44:14,220 --> 05:44:15,740
I'm going to grab gas everywhere.

4365
05:44:15,740 --> 05:44:17,349
Okay.

4366
05:44:17,349 --> 05:44:17,669
Here we go.

4367
05:44:17,669 --> 05:44:18,150
Let's just do it.

4368
05:44:46,419 --> 05:44:47,220
Don't go yet.

4369
05:44:47,220 --> 05:44:47,860
Don't go yet.

4370
05:45:02,229 --> 05:45:03,110
Pretty good.

4371
05:45:03,110 --> 05:45:04,630
Pretty good for Africa.

4372
05:45:04,630 --> 05:45:05,909
Pretty good considering.

4373
05:45:05,909 --> 05:45:06,790
Pretty good considering.

4374
05:45:08,869 --> 05:45:09,509
Oh my god.

4375
05:45:09,509 --> 05:45:10,310
That was a huge one.

4376
05:45:10,310 --> 05:45:10,709
I didn't see it.

4377
05:45:10,709 --> 05:45:11,509
Whatever.

4378
05:45:11,509 --> 05:45:12,630
Pretty good considering.

4379
05:45:12,630 --> 05:45:15,049
What did I say?

4380
05:45:15,049 --> 05:45:15,849
I want a 10 grand from that.

4381
05:45:15,849 --> 05:45:19,060
That'll be fine.

4382
05:45:19,060 --> 05:45:21,619
I would be totally happy with 10 grand.

4383
05:45:21,619 --> 05:45:25,750
My factory is new equipment on offer

4384
05:45:25,750 --> 05:45:27,669
to increase the size of gas pockets.

4385
05:45:28,310 --> 05:45:28,709
What?

4386
05:45:30,759 --> 05:45:31,400
Winter is coming.

4387
05:45:31,400 --> 05:45:33,000
We're moving to the snow area.

4388
05:45:33,000 --> 05:45:34,439
At a smaller gas pockets.

4389
05:45:34,439 --> 05:45:35,720
But there's a way to make them bigger.

4390
05:45:36,599 --> 05:45:38,439
All right.

4391
05:45:38,439 --> 05:45:38,840
This is it.

4392
05:45:39,560 --> 05:45:59,189
75 cents.

4393
05:45:59,909 --> 05:46:04,520
86 cents on the right side.

4394
05:46:04,520 --> 05:46:05,159
That's good.

4395
05:46:05,159 --> 05:46:05,880
I'm going to take it.

4396
05:46:06,680 --> 05:46:11,700
We're going to get the best plot in the game.

4397
05:46:12,259 --> 05:46:14,419
So I got to be prepared for this.

4398
05:46:15,430 --> 05:46:15,830
Thermal.

4399
05:46:20,580 --> 05:46:23,540
Activate all joints in a pipeline that encircles gas.

4400
05:46:23,540 --> 05:46:25,380
This will cause the gas to expand.

4401
05:46:33,110 --> 05:46:37,479
I don't know if we're going to do that.

4402
05:46:38,279 --> 05:46:40,869
Drilling faster.

4403
05:46:40,869 --> 05:46:41,990
Yeah, that's huge.

4404
05:46:42,709 --> 05:46:43,669
Drill faster.

4405
05:46:43,750 --> 05:46:45,669
It takes so goddamn long.

4406
05:46:45,669 --> 05:46:47,110
I might take a loan out for this.

4407
05:46:47,909 --> 05:46:53,509
All right.

4408
05:46:53,509 --> 05:46:54,470
Well, apparently this is it.

4409
05:46:55,029 --> 05:47:00,950
This is probably this is one of the best ones.

4410
05:47:00,950 --> 05:47:05,450
Two percent.

4411
05:47:05,450 --> 05:47:10,939
Just go all in on the first run.

4412
05:47:11,500 --> 05:47:12,380
That's the plan.

4413
05:47:28,099 --> 05:47:28,659
Daisy.

4414
05:47:28,659 --> 05:47:29,060
Really?

4415
05:47:29,060 --> 05:47:30,500
I was waiting for it to get whatever.

4416
05:47:30,500 --> 05:47:37,290
Let's do it.

4417
05:47:37,290 --> 05:47:38,169
I got to go all in.

4418
05:47:38,169 --> 05:47:50,419
This is apparently one of the best plots

4419
05:47:50,419 --> 05:47:51,779
in the entire video game.

4420
05:47:51,779 --> 05:47:57,689
So I got to get this right.

4421
05:47:57,689 --> 05:47:58,409
Holy shit.

4422
05:47:58,409 --> 05:47:59,849
Look at that right side.

4423
05:47:59,849 --> 05:48:01,209
What side is never going to go under?

4424
05:48:01,689 --> 05:48:02,490
Which one is it?

4425
05:48:02,490 --> 05:48:03,450
Right side?

4426
05:48:03,450 --> 05:48:05,450
That's awesome if that's true.

4427
05:48:15,049 --> 05:48:15,770
Right side.

4428
05:48:15,770 --> 05:48:16,409
Perfect.

4429
05:48:16,409 --> 05:48:37,220
Look at how big this is.

4430
05:48:37,220 --> 05:48:38,500
I got to go double here.

4431
05:48:38,500 --> 05:48:51,909
Should I connect these?

4432
05:48:51,909 --> 05:48:56,939
Just connect them.

4433
05:48:56,939 --> 05:48:58,340
Where is that?

4434
05:48:58,340 --> 05:48:59,139
That idea.

4435
05:48:59,139 --> 05:49:00,259
No, just go right in.

4436
05:49:00,259 --> 05:49:02,380
I'm just going to go right in.

4437
05:49:02,380 --> 05:49:08,090
I could run.

4438
05:49:08,090 --> 05:49:10,009
I could absolutely run away with it.

4439
05:49:10,009 --> 05:49:16,680
Now, forget about the right side.

4440
05:49:16,680 --> 05:49:17,319
The left side, I mean.

4441
05:49:17,880 --> 05:49:43,060
Okay.

4442
05:49:43,060 --> 05:49:43,700
All right.

4443
05:49:43,700 --> 05:49:56,979
I don't see any gas.

4444
05:49:56,979 --> 05:50:04,060
A little bit of gas here.

4445
05:50:04,060 --> 05:50:07,930
Already at 16K and it's June.

4446
05:50:08,729 --> 05:51:00,490
Start storing.

4447
05:51:00,490 --> 05:51:02,840
It's only July.

4448
05:51:02,840 --> 05:51:03,400
We're good.

4449
05:51:03,400 --> 05:51:16,020
It's August.

4450
05:51:16,020 --> 05:51:16,819
It's August.

4451
05:51:16,819 --> 05:51:17,860
Oh, okay.

4452
05:51:17,860 --> 05:51:18,500
Gas time.

4453
05:51:18,500 --> 05:51:21,080
Gas on the right side or left side.

4454
05:51:21,080 --> 05:51:22,860
It doesn't matter.

4455
05:51:22,860 --> 05:51:24,759
Um, hold on.

4456
05:51:24,759 --> 05:51:37,770
What side?

4457
05:51:37,770 --> 05:51:46,419
Right side, I think.

4458
05:51:46,419 --> 05:51:46,979
Shit.

4459
05:51:46,979 --> 05:51:47,459
What side?

4460
05:51:47,459 --> 05:51:48,099
What do I do?

4461
05:51:48,099 --> 05:51:48,819
What side?

4462
05:51:48,819 --> 05:51:49,380
I'm going to go.

4463
05:51:49,380 --> 05:51:50,790
All right.

4464
05:51:50,790 --> 05:51:52,630
I have no way to put anything.

4465
05:52:07,580 --> 05:52:07,900
All right.

4466
05:52:07,900 --> 05:52:08,700
All right, all right, all right.

4467
05:52:08,700 --> 05:52:09,180
Slow down.

4468
05:52:09,180 --> 05:52:12,229
Slow down.

4469
05:52:12,229 --> 05:52:13,029
Um, okay.

4470
05:52:13,029 --> 05:52:24,009
So 38 cents.

4471
05:52:24,009 --> 05:53:57,959
Not doing that yet.

4472
05:53:57,959 --> 05:53:59,319
You can't be serious.

4473
05:53:59,319 --> 05:54:00,119
It's fine.

4474
05:54:00,119 --> 05:54:01,080
I got to look at this.

4475
05:54:01,080 --> 05:54:03,939
I'm untouchable right now.

4476
05:54:03,939 --> 05:54:09,590
Almost 100K.

4477
05:54:09,590 --> 05:54:12,099
And the diamond.

4478
05:54:12,099 --> 05:54:13,509
We're doing that again.

4479
05:54:13,509 --> 05:54:14,470
81 cents on left.

4480
05:54:14,470 --> 05:54:15,110
You think it's worth it?

4481
05:54:16,759 --> 05:54:17,560
Yeah.

4482
05:54:17,560 --> 05:54:19,159
Anything over 80 I think is worth it.

4483
05:54:19,159 --> 05:54:31,740
That's mine.

4484
05:54:32,220 --> 05:54:33,979
I'm willing to pay at least 10 grand for this.

4485
05:54:34,779 --> 05:54:35,860
Sorry, Daisy.

4486
05:54:36,659 --> 05:54:44,299
Thank you.

4487
05:54:50,069 --> 05:54:51,189
Everyone's broke.

4488
05:54:51,189 --> 05:54:54,360
Look at how broke everybody is.

4489
05:54:54,360 --> 05:54:55,000
Four percent.

4490
05:54:57,159 --> 05:54:58,200
I can just sit here and wait.

4491
05:55:00,060 --> 05:55:00,380
All right.

4492
05:55:00,380 --> 05:55:02,139
I think I'm comfortable taking four percent

4493
05:55:02,139 --> 05:55:04,139
when this goes to 20K just to seal it.

4494
05:55:05,020 --> 05:55:09,659
Right before 20K.

4495
05:55:10,380 --> 05:55:23,299
25 percent.

4496
05:55:23,299 --> 05:55:26,729
And drilling speed.

4497
05:55:30,360 --> 05:55:31,720
I can do drilling speed.

4498
05:55:31,720 --> 05:55:32,360
I could do...

4499
05:55:33,159 --> 05:55:35,450
Finally get the scanner.

4500
05:55:36,169 --> 05:55:38,250
All right.

4501
05:55:38,250 --> 05:55:39,049
I got the scanner.

4502
05:55:41,509 --> 05:55:47,270
I'm going to upgrade the scanner size twice.

4503
05:55:47,270 --> 05:55:58,459
This thing better be worth it.

4504
05:55:59,340 --> 05:56:08,979
Try our new scanner.

4505
05:56:08,979 --> 05:56:10,419
Click the scanner icon.

4506
05:56:10,419 --> 05:56:13,799
Point your mouse cursor in the ground.

4507
05:56:13,799 --> 05:56:15,400
Wait until the size is right

4508
05:56:15,400 --> 05:56:17,000
and then click the reveal area.

4509
05:56:17,959 --> 05:56:21,619
What side do I want to be on?

4510
05:56:21,619 --> 05:56:21,860
Left?

4511
05:56:29,830 --> 05:56:30,389
What happened?

4512
05:56:30,389 --> 05:56:30,869
I just...

4513
05:56:30,869 --> 05:56:31,669
It's cost...

4514
05:56:31,669 --> 05:56:34,500
Oh, okay.

4515
05:56:34,500 --> 05:56:35,139
Left side, right?

4516
05:56:52,090 --> 05:56:52,810
Are you kidding me?

4517
05:56:53,369 --> 05:57:09,209
It's only 100 bucks to start that.

4518
05:57:09,209 --> 05:57:33,959
All right.

4519
05:57:33,959 --> 05:57:34,919
I got more horses.

4520
05:57:34,919 --> 05:57:44,979
I'm going to start to overflow a little flow here.

4521
05:57:44,979 --> 05:57:46,419
No, guys.

4522
05:57:46,900 --> 05:57:52,900
Okay.

4523
05:57:52,900 --> 05:57:53,380
I'm good.

4524
05:57:53,380 --> 05:58:09,459
Start some storage here.

4525
05:58:09,459 --> 05:58:22,700
Right side.

4526
05:58:22,700 --> 05:58:33,349
No.

4527
05:58:33,349 --> 05:58:34,389
Oh, my God.

4528
05:58:34,389 --> 05:58:36,869
This thing is fucking crazy.

4529
05:58:36,869 --> 05:58:38,580
There's no gas in this level.

4530
05:58:38,580 --> 05:58:44,630
Why did I buy those upgrades?

4531
05:58:44,630 --> 05:59:11,610
What was the point of that?

4532
05:59:11,610 --> 05:59:12,009
Sell.

4533
05:59:13,830 --> 05:59:15,029
Boy, that goes down.

4534
05:59:15,029 --> 05:59:43,000
Does rock crush?

4535
05:59:43,000 --> 06:00:12,950
Store, store, store, store, store, store, store, store, store.

4536
06:00:12,950 --> 06:00:20,490
The scanner is broken.

4537
06:00:20,490 --> 06:00:25,049
It's so good.

4538
06:00:25,049 --> 06:00:25,610
Gas.

4539
06:00:25,610 --> 06:00:26,009
All right.

4540
06:00:26,009 --> 06:00:26,810
What about down here?

4541
06:00:26,810 --> 06:00:32,540
All right.

4542
06:00:32,540 --> 06:00:33,979
We got double gas down here.

4543
06:00:33,979 --> 06:00:37,139
I need another omega silo

4544
06:00:37,139 --> 06:00:42,419
and we're going to get ready for the December.

4545
06:00:42,419 --> 06:00:42,819
Okay.

4546
06:00:42,900 --> 06:00:44,020
Don't sell anything.

4547
06:00:44,020 --> 06:00:45,060
Store only.

4548
06:00:45,060 --> 06:00:45,700
Forever.

4549
06:00:45,700 --> 06:01:09,750
Here's one.

4550
06:01:09,750 --> 06:01:17,180
We're going to go wham, wham and go to bed.

4551
06:01:17,180 --> 06:01:27,099
I'll go to bed when I break my streaming world record.

4552
06:01:27,099 --> 06:01:27,900
This is it over here.

4553
06:01:27,900 --> 06:01:28,139
All right.

4554
06:01:28,139 --> 06:01:28,459
This is it.

4555
06:01:28,459 --> 06:01:29,259
I got to focus on here.

4556
06:01:33,459 --> 06:01:34,580
There's three gases.

4557
06:01:34,580 --> 06:01:41,939
There's one, two, three.

4558
06:01:41,939 --> 06:01:42,180
All right.

4559
06:01:42,180 --> 06:01:42,819
Prepare.

4560
06:01:42,819 --> 06:02:01,479
September.

4561
06:02:01,479 --> 06:02:05,419
Don't drop down to 20 cents.

4562
06:02:05,419 --> 06:02:06,380
Oh, my God.

4563
06:02:06,380 --> 06:02:09,610
What a disaster.

4564
06:02:09,610 --> 06:02:11,610
I can ride this out till November.

4565
06:02:11,610 --> 06:02:20,139
Okay.

4566
06:02:20,139 --> 06:02:20,779
Here we go.

4567
06:02:20,779 --> 06:02:56,709
Was that $75,000?

4568
06:02:56,709 --> 06:02:57,750
$65,000.

4569
06:03:01,099 --> 06:03:02,299
Oh, I didn't get it all.

4570
06:03:02,299 --> 06:03:02,700
Shit.

4571
06:03:02,700 --> 06:03:04,360
Oops.

4572
06:03:04,360 --> 06:03:05,720
I forgot it was closed.

4573
06:03:05,720 --> 06:03:06,119
It's all right.

4574
06:03:06,119 --> 06:03:07,240
I'll take $63,000.

4575
06:03:07,240 --> 06:03:08,279
What am I over $100,000?

4576
06:03:08,279 --> 06:03:14,259
All right.

4577
06:03:14,259 --> 06:03:16,259
I'm on track to beat the game for sure.

4578
06:03:16,259 --> 06:03:18,250
Do I have any more diamonds?

4579
06:03:21,610 --> 06:03:21,849
All right.

4580
06:03:21,849 --> 06:03:23,770
Yeah, I'm $73,000.

4581
06:03:29,779 --> 06:03:30,819
Everybody wants this one.

4582
06:03:31,380 --> 06:03:33,319
Do you think this one here?

4583
06:03:33,319 --> 06:03:33,720
Which one?

4584
06:03:33,720 --> 06:03:34,119
Down here?

4585
06:03:38,099 --> 06:03:38,900
I'm going to save this one.

4586
06:03:38,900 --> 06:03:39,939
This is probably safe.

4587
06:03:39,939 --> 06:03:45,209
Or this one here.

4588
06:03:47,099 --> 06:03:48,619
Left up like this one.

4589
06:03:49,180 --> 06:03:52,250
Right of $73,000.

4590
06:03:54,950 --> 06:03:56,150
This like up here.

4591
06:03:56,150 --> 06:03:56,630
That's too good.

4592
06:03:56,630 --> 06:03:57,830
That's close to $34,000 though.

4593
06:03:57,830 --> 06:03:58,630
That could be scary.

4594
06:04:00,459 --> 06:04:01,979
That could actually be scary.

4595
06:04:01,979 --> 06:04:03,540
What's wrong with my elbow?

4596
06:04:04,259 --> 06:04:06,810
What is that?

4597
06:04:07,529 --> 06:04:12,580
Oh, it's resting.

4598
06:04:12,580 --> 06:04:14,020
Oh, it's because I'm resting.

4599
06:04:14,020 --> 06:04:14,500
It's fine.

4600
06:04:14,500 --> 06:04:14,740
I'm fine.

4601
06:04:14,740 --> 06:04:15,299
It doesn't hurt.

4602
06:04:15,299 --> 06:04:16,020
It's fine.

4603
06:04:16,020 --> 06:04:17,540
It's a rash.

4604
06:04:18,180 --> 06:04:21,139
It's from sitting leaning for an entire episode of this game.

4605
06:04:21,700 --> 06:04:28,099
I'm all right.

4606
06:04:28,099 --> 06:04:29,939
I'm scared to go to the top right.

4607
06:04:29,939 --> 06:04:31,220
Because oh, because you can't see.

4608
06:04:31,939 --> 06:04:32,979
There's a $34,000 right here.

4609
06:04:35,319 --> 06:04:35,959
That's scary.

4610
06:04:38,740 --> 06:04:39,860
I think I'm going to go right here.

4611
06:04:40,500 --> 06:04:44,299
Everyone wants the top shit.

4612
06:04:44,299 --> 06:04:44,779
That's fine.

4613
06:04:45,419 --> 06:04:46,299
I'll be fine with $60,000.

4614
06:04:46,299 --> 06:04:46,779
I'm way ahead.

4615
06:04:51,849 --> 06:04:53,209
Uh, herd size.

4616
06:04:53,209 --> 06:04:54,169
40 horses?

4617
06:04:54,169 --> 06:05:00,330
I don't think I need that.

4618
06:05:00,330 --> 06:05:01,450
Oh, yes.

4619
06:05:01,450 --> 06:05:02,090
Right Inc.

4620
06:05:02,090 --> 06:05:03,209
98 cents.

4621
06:05:03,209 --> 06:05:04,090
Can't go below it.

4622
06:05:04,090 --> 06:05:04,490
Perfect.

4623
06:05:05,209 --> 06:05:07,700
All right.

4624
06:05:07,700 --> 06:05:08,500
$64,000.

4625
06:05:09,380 --> 06:05:10,580
This is for 6%.

4626
06:05:10,580 --> 06:05:11,299
I got to buy this.

4627
06:05:14,229 --> 06:05:14,869
All right.

4628
06:05:14,869 --> 06:05:15,189
6%.

4629
06:05:16,150 --> 06:05:24,340
I'm going to pull the trigger right now.

4630
06:05:24,900 --> 06:05:27,610
I need, I'm going to do it.

4631
06:05:27,610 --> 06:05:28,740
I'm at 31.

4632
06:05:28,740 --> 06:05:29,779
I have tons of money.

4633
06:05:30,340 --> 06:05:31,610
I'm at 31%.

4634
06:05:34,259 --> 06:05:36,979
I cannot risk, um, anybody else getting that.

4635
06:05:36,979 --> 06:05:39,060
Especially you because that you'd be at 16.

4636
06:05:39,939 --> 06:05:45,369
All right.

4637
06:05:45,369 --> 06:05:45,930
I'm good now.

4638
06:05:46,490 --> 06:05:49,610
You look tired.

4639
06:05:50,169 --> 06:05:51,450
Um, I would.

4640
06:05:51,450 --> 06:05:53,369
I mean, I'm a little, a little drained.

4641
06:05:53,369 --> 06:05:53,930
I'm fine though.

4642
06:05:54,810 --> 06:05:57,049
I wouldn't say I'm tired.

4643
06:05:57,689 --> 06:05:59,659
Okay.

4644
06:05:59,659 --> 06:06:02,459
Let's make sure I don't blow this, uh, right side.

4645
06:06:07,990 --> 06:06:08,470
Not great.

4646
06:06:09,110 --> 06:06:09,750
Not great.

4647
06:06:09,750 --> 06:06:10,549
Let's get some moles.

4648
06:06:11,270 --> 06:06:20,840
Okay.

4649
06:06:20,840 --> 06:06:21,639
We're going to go right.

4650
06:06:21,639 --> 06:06:22,520
There's a lot in the middle.

4651
06:06:23,080 --> 06:06:24,200
All right.

4652
06:06:24,200 --> 06:06:26,520
We're going to go right here and I'm going to go.

4653
06:06:27,479 --> 06:06:27,880
Wham.

4654
06:06:27,880 --> 06:06:28,200
Wham.

4655
06:06:28,200 --> 06:06:28,520
Wham.

4656
06:06:29,159 --> 06:06:43,430
Start getting some cash, please.

4657
06:06:54,970 --> 06:06:58,700
Come on.

4658
06:06:58,700 --> 06:06:59,580
I'm on.

4659
06:06:59,580 --> 06:07:13,900
Okay.

4660
06:07:13,900 --> 06:07:14,380
That's good.

4661
06:07:14,380 --> 06:07:15,020
Let's upgrade.

4662
06:07:16,259 --> 06:07:17,060
Ready?

4663
06:07:17,060 --> 06:07:17,860
Get another horse.

4664
06:07:18,419 --> 06:07:19,139
Staying on the right side.

4665
06:07:19,139 --> 06:07:27,799
I'm not, I don't care about left.

4666
06:07:27,799 --> 06:07:29,720
It's going to start to get funky here.

4667
06:07:29,720 --> 06:08:02,569
Look at that money rolling in and what I want to see.

4668
06:08:02,569 --> 06:08:11,880
It's all upgraded all the way.

4669
06:08:11,880 --> 06:08:12,279
All right.

4670
06:08:12,279 --> 06:08:15,060
Now let's do scan over here.

4671
06:08:15,060 --> 06:08:22,729
Look at the gas now.

4672
06:08:22,729 --> 06:08:23,209
Wow.

4673
06:08:23,209 --> 06:08:23,689
All right.

4674
06:08:23,689 --> 06:08:24,650
Holy shit.

4675
06:08:24,650 --> 06:09:07,099
Time for the big money.

4676
06:09:07,099 --> 06:09:10,330
Time to begin storing.

4677
06:09:10,330 --> 06:09:13,610
All right.

4678
06:09:13,610 --> 06:09:14,490
We're in August.

4679
06:09:14,490 --> 06:09:15,750
Fill those tanks.

4680
06:09:15,750 --> 06:09:31,080
September.

4681
06:09:31,080 --> 06:09:35,700
Fill them up.

4682
06:09:35,700 --> 06:09:36,340
All right.

4683
06:09:36,340 --> 06:09:38,709
Do I even do the gas?

4684
06:09:38,709 --> 06:09:40,659
There's only one gas here.

4685
06:09:40,659 --> 06:09:49,990
Is it really only one gas?

4686
06:09:49,990 --> 06:09:59,700
It's all right.

4687
06:09:59,700 --> 06:10:06,279
It might be one here.

4688
06:10:06,279 --> 06:10:06,919
Shit.

4689
06:10:06,919 --> 06:10:07,479
Wait.

4690
06:10:07,479 --> 06:10:16,549
Son of a gun.

4691
06:10:16,549 --> 06:10:17,720
Son of a gun.

4692
06:10:17,720 --> 06:10:24,819
Who needs the gas?

4693
06:10:24,819 --> 06:10:38,419
All right.

4694
06:10:38,419 --> 06:10:39,220
Let's go.

4695
06:10:39,220 --> 06:10:40,939
I have a gas.

4696
06:10:55,209 --> 06:10:56,650
Still on the left side.

4697
06:10:56,650 --> 06:10:58,310
Left side.

4698
06:10:58,310 --> 06:10:59,110
Go to left side.

4699
06:10:59,110 --> 06:11:03,240
All of you change it.

4700
06:11:04,279 --> 06:11:05,000
Right side.

4701
06:11:05,720 --> 06:11:06,680
Right side.

4702
06:11:06,680 --> 06:11:20,970
We're good.

4703
06:11:20,970 --> 06:11:21,930
40,000.

4704
06:11:21,930 --> 06:11:22,490
I got everything.

4705
06:11:22,490 --> 06:11:23,209
I'll get the bonuses.

4706
06:11:23,209 --> 06:11:23,770
All of it.

4707
06:11:23,770 --> 06:11:24,490
3k.

4708
06:11:24,490 --> 06:11:31,959
At least you still got it all sold.

4709
06:11:31,959 --> 06:11:32,680
Yeah.

4710
06:11:32,680 --> 06:11:35,880
This is in the bag by the way.

4711
06:11:35,880 --> 06:11:36,360
There's no way.

4712
06:11:36,360 --> 06:11:37,720
I don't think I can lose.

4713
06:11:37,720 --> 06:11:40,970
This is too weird for me.

4714
06:11:40,970 --> 06:11:42,569
I don't think I even want it.

4715
06:11:42,569 --> 06:12:02,540
Do the super gas.

4716
06:12:02,540 --> 06:12:05,750
Thermal could be mega OP.

4717
06:12:05,750 --> 06:12:06,790
I'll try it.

4718
06:12:06,790 --> 06:12:07,270
I'll try it.

4719
06:12:07,750 --> 06:12:09,750
I want to make sure I have enough money to not care.

4720
06:12:10,389 --> 06:12:11,270
I have 80,000.

4721
06:12:11,270 --> 06:12:12,869
I want to make sure I'm not going to buy anything.

4722
06:12:15,430 --> 06:12:16,069
60k.

4723
06:12:23,909 --> 06:12:24,389
That's...

4724
06:12:24,389 --> 06:12:24,709
No.

4725
06:12:25,270 --> 06:12:25,990
That's too much.

4726
06:12:27,430 --> 06:12:28,150
That's too much.

4727
06:12:34,069 --> 06:12:35,669
84 on the right side.

4728
06:12:39,209 --> 06:12:39,450
Sure.

4729
06:12:44,389 --> 06:12:46,630
I'll do speed three though.

4730
06:12:46,630 --> 06:12:48,549
Because the drill can go so fast I think.

4731
06:12:51,799 --> 06:12:52,680
Six percent.

4732
06:12:52,680 --> 06:12:53,180
Uh-oh.

4733
06:12:57,779 --> 06:12:59,860
You're not going to spend literally your entire net worth on this.

4734
06:13:01,060 --> 06:13:01,700
But you might.

4735
06:13:03,479 --> 06:13:12,229
I'm almost there.

4736
06:13:12,229 --> 06:13:12,729
Elbow.

4737
06:13:14,860 --> 06:13:17,419
I'm telling you it's also because the camera is set up a certain way.

4738
06:13:23,029 --> 06:13:24,630
Stop playing fart simulator.

4739
06:13:36,360 --> 06:13:38,919
Are you really saying this is a fart simulator game?

4740
06:13:38,919 --> 06:13:52,909
Start.

4741
06:13:56,250 --> 06:14:01,779
Good start Andy.

4742
06:14:01,779 --> 06:14:02,659
There's gas down here.

4743
06:14:11,369 --> 06:14:12,330
I'm begging you.

4744
06:14:12,330 --> 06:14:13,290
I don't know what you're begging me.

4745
06:14:15,290 --> 06:14:37,139
All right.

4746
06:14:37,139 --> 06:14:38,580
This is super drill now.

4747
06:14:38,580 --> 06:14:42,279
So now I'm going to only...

4748
06:14:42,279 --> 06:14:43,319
I'm going to use this thing, right?

4749
06:14:44,119 --> 06:14:44,840
Let's go over here.

4750
06:14:50,439 --> 06:14:51,159
I think that's gas.

4751
06:14:58,650 --> 06:14:59,529
Very nice.

4752
06:14:59,529 --> 06:15:00,169
Very nice.

4753
06:15:20,139 --> 06:15:22,779
Is it efficient if I put one of these things here and connect it?

4754
06:15:22,779 --> 06:15:24,139
Or is there any reason to do that?

4755
06:15:25,450 --> 06:15:28,169
Should I put one like another one and connect it here?

4756
06:15:28,169 --> 06:15:29,130
Would it pump faster?

4757
06:15:29,849 --> 06:15:30,349
Or no?

4758
06:15:34,790 --> 06:15:35,290
No.

4759
06:15:35,750 --> 06:15:36,250
Yes.

4760
06:15:37,029 --> 06:15:37,529
Left.

4761
06:15:37,529 --> 06:15:38,869
No, I don't care about left.

4762
06:15:38,869 --> 06:15:39,909
No, we're good.

4763
06:15:39,909 --> 06:15:40,409
We're good.

4764
06:15:40,790 --> 06:15:54,389
120.

4765
06:15:54,389 --> 06:15:54,630
I don't know.

4766
06:15:54,630 --> 06:15:55,130
I don't care.

4767
06:16:46,279 --> 06:16:47,240
Oh yeah.

4768
06:16:48,490 --> 06:16:49,900
So it's August.

4769
06:16:49,900 --> 06:17:09,290
We're good.

4770
06:17:09,290 --> 06:17:09,790
What?

4771
06:17:09,790 --> 06:17:23,990
Let's go this way.

4772
06:17:23,990 --> 06:17:24,389
All right.

4773
06:17:24,389 --> 06:17:25,110
Let's go.

4774
06:17:25,110 --> 06:17:28,970
Why is he sweating so much?

4775
06:17:29,849 --> 06:17:32,330
I've been obviously in the same chair for 12 hours, dude.

4776
06:17:33,349 --> 06:17:33,669
I'm not...

4777
06:17:33,669 --> 06:17:34,869
No, my hair just went down.

4778
06:17:34,869 --> 06:17:35,369
You're fine.

4779
06:17:36,569 --> 06:17:37,069
I'm fine.

4780
06:17:37,610 --> 06:17:39,669
You're going to be fine.

4781
06:17:39,669 --> 06:17:46,040
November.

4782
06:17:50,200 --> 06:17:52,279
I'm not going to fill that.

4783
06:17:52,279 --> 06:17:53,930
That's not going to happen.

4784
06:17:56,439 --> 06:17:57,799
Bottleneck Billy.

4785
06:18:00,500 --> 06:18:01,540
I just need to...

4786
06:18:01,540 --> 06:18:01,860
Whatever.

4787
06:18:01,860 --> 06:18:02,500
Where's the gas?

4788
06:18:03,299 --> 06:18:04,740
Bottleneck Billy.

4789
06:18:05,459 --> 06:18:21,139
I made it with 17k.

4790
06:18:21,779 --> 06:18:24,069
Okay.

4791
06:18:24,069 --> 06:18:25,830
So that's not efficient.

4792
06:18:25,830 --> 06:18:26,389
It's fine.

4793
06:18:26,389 --> 06:18:26,889
I got money.

4794
06:18:28,680 --> 06:18:29,180
Uh-oh.

4795
06:18:47,860 --> 06:18:48,580
8k for this?

4796
06:18:49,610 --> 06:18:50,250
God, dude.

4797
06:18:50,250 --> 06:18:50,750
10k?

4798
06:19:06,759 --> 06:19:07,319
She's smart.

4799
06:19:07,319 --> 06:19:07,959
I'm going up here.

4800
06:19:07,959 --> 06:19:13,500
This is going to be like probably 50.

4801
06:19:13,500 --> 06:19:15,610
All right.

4802
06:19:15,610 --> 06:19:16,810
I have to make sure I...

4803
06:19:17,369 --> 06:19:18,459
This is for 4%.

4804
06:19:19,180 --> 06:19:19,680
Okay.

4805
06:19:20,619 --> 06:19:21,020
Spend...

4806
06:19:21,020 --> 06:19:21,419
Do it now.

4807
06:19:21,419 --> 06:19:22,139
Spend all your money.

4808
06:19:22,779 --> 06:19:26,729
You can afford it.

4809
06:19:26,729 --> 06:19:27,229
Buy it right now.

4810
06:19:27,849 --> 06:19:31,290
You can afford it.

4811
06:19:31,290 --> 06:19:31,790
Buy it.

4812
06:19:36,939 --> 06:19:37,439
Yeah, good.

4813
06:19:38,299 --> 06:19:38,799
$27,000.

4814
06:19:39,979 --> 06:19:41,099
I have 37%.

4815
06:19:41,099 --> 06:19:43,020
You'll never match my share count.

4816
06:19:43,020 --> 06:19:47,470
That's fine.

4817
06:19:48,009 --> 06:19:54,869
By the way, don't ever forget who vetoed the diet soda machine.

4818
06:19:56,250 --> 06:19:56,750
This guy.

4819
06:19:57,369 --> 06:20:01,450
Oh, you voted for that?

4820
06:20:02,009 --> 06:20:03,209
Yeah, we're going to have a diet soda machine.

4821
06:20:03,209 --> 06:20:03,770
We're going to have diet...

4822
06:20:03,770 --> 06:20:04,270
No.

4823
06:20:04,270 --> 06:20:06,409
I put my 3,700,000 shares.

4824
06:20:07,290 --> 06:20:08,569
I vetoed that.

4825
06:20:09,290 --> 06:20:11,099
12-hour Andy?

4826
06:20:11,099 --> 06:20:11,599
Yep.

4827
06:20:11,979 --> 06:20:32,599
What am I with?

4828
06:20:32,599 --> 06:20:33,099
All right.

4829
06:20:33,560 --> 06:20:35,430
I see gas right there.

4830
06:20:36,069 --> 06:20:39,000
Give me a loan.

4831
06:20:39,720 --> 06:20:40,439
I'll pay it back.

4832
06:20:40,439 --> 06:20:41,880
It's so easy to pay back.

4833
06:20:42,680 --> 06:20:54,229
All right.

4834
06:20:54,229 --> 06:20:55,669
I'm not going to be a bottleneck Barry.

4835
06:21:31,380 --> 06:21:31,880
Shut up.

4836
06:21:32,340 --> 06:21:32,840
Pow.

4837
06:21:33,380 --> 06:21:50,709
Okay.

4838
06:21:50,709 --> 06:21:51,909
Fill up that silo.

4839
06:21:51,909 --> 06:21:52,409
Now.

4840
06:21:52,409 --> 06:21:54,389
Canning.

4841
06:21:54,389 --> 06:22:20,200
Oh, there's no more.

4842
06:22:20,200 --> 06:23:21,740
Start filling it up.

4843
06:23:21,740 --> 06:23:32,500
Nothing.

4844
06:23:32,500 --> 06:23:33,000
Really?

4845
06:23:34,840 --> 06:23:36,439
This ones suck.

4846
06:23:36,439 --> 06:23:39,700
Not even worth getting that fucking gas.

4847
06:23:39,700 --> 06:23:40,099
Look at that.

4848
06:23:40,099 --> 06:23:41,060
Not even worth it.

4849
06:23:41,060 --> 06:23:41,939
I'm just going to sell, man.

4850
06:23:41,939 --> 06:23:42,900
It's not worth it.

4851
06:23:45,750 --> 06:23:46,470
There's nothing else.

4852
06:23:47,110 --> 06:23:52,889
Unless there's something right here.

4853
06:23:53,529 --> 06:23:55,060
Then I got to start selling.

4854
06:23:55,700 --> 06:23:58,009
What a terrible map.

4855
06:23:58,569 --> 06:23:59,069
What?

4856
06:23:59,529 --> 06:24:02,259
All right.

4857
06:24:02,259 --> 06:24:06,500
Just store until I get a good return potential here.

4858
06:24:06,500 --> 06:24:07,619
Left side looking pretty good.

4859
06:24:08,340 --> 06:24:10,549
Everybody go.

4860
06:24:10,549 --> 06:24:11,049
Left side.

4861
06:24:17,060 --> 06:24:17,700
Good.

4862
06:24:17,700 --> 06:24:18,659
Very good.

4863
06:24:18,659 --> 06:24:19,619
Very good.

4864
06:24:19,619 --> 06:24:20,020
Very good.

4865
06:24:20,020 --> 06:24:21,220
And I'm going to end early.

4866
06:24:24,869 --> 06:24:25,830
Look at how shitty this was.

4867
06:24:26,389 --> 06:24:36,250
Falling off.

4868
06:24:36,250 --> 06:24:39,580
The race for the majority of the stocks is getting exciting.

4869
06:24:39,580 --> 06:24:43,659
Remember that the first person with 50 plus percent becomes the new mayor.

4870
06:24:49,849 --> 06:24:50,810
Show me where a good one is.

4871
06:24:56,470 --> 06:24:56,709
Yeah.

4872
06:24:56,709 --> 06:24:57,270
No shit.

4873
06:24:57,270 --> 06:24:58,069
It's going to be that one.

4874
06:24:58,709 --> 06:25:00,150
Why did I give this guy a diamond?

4875
06:25:00,630 --> 06:25:06,439
Who has the most money?

4876
06:25:06,439 --> 06:25:12,779
Somebody outbid me on that.

4877
06:25:13,500 --> 06:25:14,900
Somebody outbid me on that.

4878
06:25:15,540 --> 06:25:16,099
Oh my god.

4879
06:25:16,099 --> 06:25:16,819
You idiot.

4880
06:25:17,779 --> 06:25:18,740
$12,000.

4881
06:25:19,779 --> 06:25:21,139
I'm just going to go steal this from you.

4882
06:25:28,919 --> 06:25:29,319
I think.

4883
06:25:29,880 --> 06:25:30,360
Who?

4884
06:25:30,360 --> 06:25:31,639
Everyone's snoozing on the left side.

4885
06:25:31,639 --> 06:25:33,000
57, 65, 59.

4886
06:25:33,000 --> 06:25:33,479
You kidding me?

4887
06:25:33,959 --> 06:25:38,180
I just screwed you.

4888
06:25:38,180 --> 06:25:39,459
You just got screwed.

4889
06:25:39,459 --> 06:25:40,810
Let's go.

4890
06:25:42,520 --> 06:25:42,840
8%.

4891
06:25:44,040 --> 06:25:46,810
I got to lock it in.

4892
06:25:47,450 --> 06:25:48,409
I got to lock it in right now.

4893
06:25:49,049 --> 06:25:50,250
I'm going to lock it in right now.

4894
06:25:50,250 --> 06:25:51,369
One, two, three.

4895
06:25:51,369 --> 06:25:52,250
I'm going to lock it in right now.

4896
06:25:56,250 --> 06:25:56,889
45%.

4897
06:25:59,189 --> 06:26:01,029
I'm almost the mayor of the city.

4898
06:26:01,029 --> 06:26:02,549
It's going to be close.

4899
06:26:03,110 --> 06:26:08,650
And this is probably a really good spot.

4900
06:26:09,529 --> 06:26:09,930
Let's go.

4901
06:26:12,500 --> 06:26:13,860
Five more percent and I win.

4902
06:26:13,860 --> 06:26:27,110
That's bad.

4903
06:26:27,110 --> 06:26:29,130
It's actually really terrible.

4904
06:26:29,689 --> 06:26:30,919
I'm going to take a loan out.

4905
06:26:31,560 --> 06:26:41,159
Okay.

4906
06:26:41,159 --> 06:26:41,720
This is not bad.

4907
06:26:41,720 --> 06:26:43,240
Let's get some gophers.

4908
06:26:43,240 --> 06:26:51,290
It's all in the middle.

4909
06:26:51,849 --> 06:26:52,970
We're going to stay on the left side.

4910
06:26:52,970 --> 06:26:53,770
All it's all in the middle.

4911
06:26:53,770 --> 06:26:54,490
It's all right here.

4912
06:26:54,490 --> 06:27:21,639
Go somewhere with it.

4913
06:27:22,970 --> 06:27:24,490
I just sounded so angry.

4914
06:27:24,490 --> 06:28:04,650
We're going straight down from here.

4915
06:28:06,680 --> 06:28:07,560
How do I cancel that?

4916
06:28:07,560 --> 06:28:10,520
Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.

4917
06:28:10,520 --> 06:28:29,750
It's not serious.

4918
06:28:29,750 --> 06:28:31,029
It is because I don't want to lose the game.

4919
06:28:31,029 --> 06:29:32,150
I'm about to beat the game.

4920
06:29:32,150 --> 06:29:33,270
Bottleneck Billy.

4921
06:29:33,270 --> 06:29:35,130
This isn't it's not that bad, is it?

4922
06:29:35,130 --> 06:30:13,720
Fill it up.

4923
06:30:13,720 --> 06:30:57,270
It's already gone.

4924
06:30:57,830 --> 06:30:59,099
It's already worse.

4925
06:31:17,639 --> 06:31:18,840
Oh, my fucking God.

4926
06:31:18,840 --> 06:31:20,680
I didn't I didn't even pay attention.

4927
06:31:20,680 --> 06:31:24,889
I think that's it.

4928
06:31:24,889 --> 06:31:26,009
I think all the resources are gone.

4929
06:31:26,009 --> 06:31:26,889
I have to drain this.

4930
06:31:26,889 --> 06:31:34,139
Drain it, drain it, drain it already.

4931
06:31:34,139 --> 06:31:34,540
All right.

4932
06:31:34,540 --> 06:31:38,540
Are we at zero?

4933
06:31:38,540 --> 06:31:39,819
All the resources are gone, right?

4934
06:31:40,380 --> 06:31:42,220
Oh, fuck you.

4935
06:32:21,590 --> 06:32:22,869
He told me about that spot.

4936
06:32:22,869 --> 06:32:24,069
It's my secret place.

4937
06:32:42,119 --> 06:32:43,159
I win the game if I do this.

4938
06:32:43,720 --> 06:32:59,939
I have to make some money.

4939
06:32:59,939 --> 06:33:03,930
Could I have just taken out a loan of like 50 grand

4940
06:33:03,930 --> 06:33:05,049
and just been the mayor?

4941
06:33:09,209 --> 06:33:09,849
Oh, shit.

4942
06:33:09,849 --> 06:33:10,810
This is really bad.

4943
06:33:10,810 --> 06:33:11,529
All right.

4944
06:33:11,529 --> 06:33:16,779
This better hopefully chat was right.

4945
06:33:16,779 --> 06:33:19,259
I'm not going to blow like two grand with the scanner.

4946
06:33:23,900 --> 06:33:26,139
Seems pretty promising so far right in the middle here.

4947
06:33:40,819 --> 06:33:42,340
Seems pretty promising right off the bat.

4948
06:33:42,819 --> 06:33:43,459
Two big ones.

4949
06:33:44,860 --> 06:33:45,900
And a gas right there.

4950
06:34:27,270 --> 06:34:28,389
Don't overflow.

4951
06:34:28,389 --> 06:34:29,430
Not on me now.

4952
06:34:29,430 --> 06:34:47,959
Store.

4953
06:34:47,959 --> 06:34:59,319
I'll take the diamond.

4954
06:34:59,319 --> 06:34:59,560
All right.

4955
06:34:59,560 --> 06:35:00,360
This is all right.

4956
06:35:00,360 --> 06:35:01,799
I'm just going to go down from here.

4957
06:35:01,799 --> 06:35:05,349
Keep this one running.

4958
06:35:05,349 --> 06:35:21,849
A whole lot of nothing.

4959
06:35:21,849 --> 06:35:27,849
I need some money.

4960
06:35:27,849 --> 06:35:37,369
All right.

4961
06:35:37,369 --> 06:35:38,009
11 grand.

4962
06:35:39,319 --> 06:35:41,000
Actually, everyone keeps selling

4963
06:35:41,000 --> 06:35:56,569
because I need I need the cash bad.

4964
06:35:56,569 --> 06:35:58,009
Place is dry, guys.

4965
06:36:00,540 --> 06:36:04,619
Place is dry, man.

4966
06:36:04,619 --> 06:36:17,419
Place is dry.

4967
06:36:17,419 --> 06:36:19,060
Guys, place is dry.

4968
06:36:19,060 --> 06:36:19,619
Right, right.

4969
06:36:19,619 --> 06:36:20,340
What do you mean right?

4970
06:36:20,340 --> 06:36:21,619
This place is dry, man.

4971
06:36:21,619 --> 06:36:26,490
There ain't nothing here.

4972
06:36:27,689 --> 06:36:28,330
Sell right.

4973
06:36:29,939 --> 06:36:30,819
There's nothing else to sell.

4974
06:36:31,619 --> 06:36:33,750
There's nothing else.

4975
06:36:33,750 --> 06:36:34,389
Sell right.

4976
06:36:35,669 --> 06:36:37,029
The oil is gone.

4977
06:36:51,689 --> 06:37:07,450
This place was junk.

4978
06:37:07,450 --> 06:37:08,330
I got 40k.

4979
06:37:10,540 --> 06:37:11,340
All right.

4980
06:37:11,340 --> 06:37:13,979
I am in a position to get that.

4981
06:37:13,979 --> 06:37:14,459
Hold on.

4982
06:37:19,479 --> 06:37:21,159
71 cents on left side.

4983
06:37:21,159 --> 06:37:21,959
Not enough.

4984
06:37:21,959 --> 06:37:23,720
80 cents on right side.

4985
06:37:26,009 --> 06:37:26,250
No.

4986
06:37:31,740 --> 06:37:32,860
This is really okay.

4987
06:37:33,419 --> 06:37:34,380
They're going to think I'm stupid.

4988
06:37:34,939 --> 06:37:45,700
That's fine.

4989
06:37:45,700 --> 06:37:48,520
I got 34k.

4990
06:37:50,180 --> 06:37:50,819
Four percent.

4991
06:38:08,439 --> 06:38:09,000
All right.

4992
06:38:09,000 --> 06:38:09,639
I fucked up.

4993
06:38:12,790 --> 06:38:14,069
I clicked a little too late.

4994
06:38:26,099 --> 06:38:29,880
The Patriots just got like three safeties in a row.

4995
06:38:29,880 --> 06:38:30,919
That was that reaction.

4996
06:38:33,099 --> 06:38:37,099
Like Tom Brady fumbled the ball 15 times in the first quarter.

4997
06:38:37,659 --> 06:38:39,340
That's like what that is.

4998
06:38:39,340 --> 06:38:40,220
That's what I just did.

4999
06:38:43,349 --> 06:38:43,750
All right.

5000
06:38:45,290 --> 06:38:46,569
No scanning.

5001
06:38:46,569 --> 06:38:47,529
No scanning.

5002
06:38:47,529 --> 06:38:48,250
This is apparent.

5003
06:38:48,250 --> 06:38:49,369
This might be a good one.

5004
06:38:50,009 --> 06:38:52,650
We're doing gophers.

5005
06:38:52,650 --> 06:39:01,340
It's going to be the big one.

5006
06:39:01,340 --> 06:39:02,540
I see gas over here.

5007
06:39:03,099 --> 06:39:05,900
I'll take a loan.

5008
06:39:05,900 --> 06:39:06,619
I don't fucking care.

5009
06:39:07,180 --> 06:39:07,419
No.

5010
06:39:18,139 --> 06:39:19,419
I don't want to go in there yet.

5011
06:39:19,419 --> 06:39:20,299
I don't know.

5012
06:39:20,299 --> 06:39:25,529
Okay.

5013
06:39:25,529 --> 06:39:26,490
So of course.

5014
06:39:32,169 --> 06:39:33,130
This one sucks.

5015
06:39:33,130 --> 06:39:33,770
I know it does.

5016
06:39:47,770 --> 06:39:48,810
This one sucks.

5017
06:39:48,810 --> 06:39:51,139
This is going to be two or three little dumps.

5018
06:39:51,779 --> 06:39:52,259
And that's it.

5019
06:39:52,819 --> 06:40:16,040
Start storing.

5020
06:40:16,040 --> 06:40:16,919
All right.

5021
06:40:16,919 --> 06:40:18,360
I need to make a move here.

5022
06:40:18,360 --> 06:40:19,479
Scan.

5023
06:40:19,479 --> 06:40:22,330
Is there anything down here that I can get over here?

5024
06:40:26,520 --> 06:40:27,240
Oh my god.

5025
06:40:27,240 --> 06:40:29,560
They look at all this gas but this place sucks.

5026
06:40:29,560 --> 06:40:40,759
It's already June.

5027
06:40:40,759 --> 06:40:41,560
I don't have shit.

5028
06:40:43,290 --> 06:40:44,889
There's three gases though.

5029
06:40:44,889 --> 06:40:56,580
This place is ass.

5030
06:40:56,580 --> 06:41:31,319
This place is ass.

5031
06:41:31,319 --> 06:41:44,069
This store.

5032
06:41:44,069 --> 06:41:46,200
There's no reason to do this right now.

5033
06:41:46,200 --> 06:41:48,040
Just store and wait for the big thing at the end.

5034
06:41:48,040 --> 06:41:58,759
This place is absolute ass.

5035
06:41:58,759 --> 06:42:00,040
Fill up this silo.

5036
06:42:00,040 --> 06:42:26,439
Look at how terrible this is.

5037
06:42:26,439 --> 06:42:29,110
I bet you this is 15.

5038
06:42:29,110 --> 06:42:29,990
It's probably 10.

5039
06:42:32,220 --> 06:42:33,979
This shit's probably five.

5040
06:42:33,979 --> 06:42:36,220
It's going to be the lowest of the whole game.

5041
06:42:36,220 --> 06:42:38,860
I should have just bid another five grand

5042
06:42:38,860 --> 06:42:39,740
and taken it from that guy.

5043
06:42:39,740 --> 06:42:40,619
That might have lost me the game.

5044
06:42:42,650 --> 06:42:43,689
I may have just lost me the whole game.

5045
06:42:44,819 --> 06:42:45,700
All right.

5046
06:42:45,700 --> 06:42:46,500
Let's go.

5047
06:42:46,500 --> 06:42:47,459
Here we go.

5048
06:42:47,459 --> 06:42:47,939
This way.

5049
06:42:48,740 --> 06:42:54,500
It's time to open up the gas.

5050
06:43:16,090 --> 06:43:19,380
What are you talking about?

5051
06:43:19,380 --> 06:43:30,470
It's 21.

5052
06:43:30,470 --> 06:43:41,560
It's still bad.

5053
06:43:41,560 --> 06:43:43,080
I have to win this auction.

5054
06:43:43,080 --> 06:43:43,720
Whatever it is.

5055
06:43:44,439 --> 06:43:50,180
I need five percent.

5056
06:43:52,869 --> 06:43:53,669
Okay.

5057
06:43:53,669 --> 06:43:58,069
I'm just kidding.

5058
06:43:58,069 --> 06:43:58,790
I won the game.

5059
06:43:58,790 --> 06:43:59,349
I won the game.

5060
06:43:59,349 --> 06:44:00,229
I just won the game.

5061
06:44:00,229 --> 06:44:02,409
I'm at 50 percent.

5062
06:44:02,409 --> 06:44:03,290
I own the company.

5063
06:44:03,290 --> 06:44:04,169
I own the company.

5064
06:44:04,169 --> 06:44:05,130
You're fired.

5065
06:44:05,130 --> 06:44:06,090
You're fired.

5066
06:44:06,090 --> 06:44:07,049
You're fired.

5067
06:44:07,049 --> 06:44:08,090
You're all fired.

5068
06:44:08,090 --> 06:44:10,490
And by the way, I'm taking a vacation.

5069
06:44:11,750 --> 06:44:12,150
I win.

5070
06:44:14,229 --> 06:44:14,950
It's 51.

5071
06:44:15,669 --> 06:44:17,959
No, it's not.

5072
06:44:21,799 --> 06:44:22,599
He said 50.

5073
06:44:23,159 --> 06:44:31,189
What are you talking about?

5074
06:44:31,189 --> 06:44:40,250
It's gonna be a good one.

5075
06:44:40,250 --> 06:44:41,529
Oh, yeah.

5076
06:44:43,669 --> 06:44:44,389
Oh, yeah.

5077
06:44:44,389 --> 06:44:45,349
This is a big one.

5078
06:44:45,349 --> 06:45:06,150
Let's go double here.

5079
06:45:06,150 --> 06:45:07,349
Oh, shit.

5080
06:45:07,349 --> 06:45:49,159
This is gonna be the big one.

5081
06:45:49,159 --> 06:45:49,720
I know it.

5082
06:45:49,720 --> 06:45:54,090
There's two huge veins right here.

5083
06:45:54,090 --> 06:45:54,650
Left.

5084
06:45:54,650 --> 06:46:03,830
I see like, I just have a meteor just hit the earth.

5085
06:46:03,830 --> 06:46:04,950
There's nothing even over here.

5086
06:46:06,389 --> 06:46:06,790
Really?

5087
06:46:08,869 --> 06:46:10,229
What the fuck?

5088
06:46:10,229 --> 06:46:38,580
Nothing.

5089
06:46:38,580 --> 06:46:42,740
I think this actually might be it.

5090
06:46:42,740 --> 06:46:55,509
Oh, there's a little one down there.

5091
06:46:55,509 --> 06:46:57,029
Dude, it's empty.

5092
06:46:57,029 --> 06:47:00,200
Forget about the gas.

5093
06:47:01,400 --> 06:47:18,520
I just need over like 30k or 20k and I win the game.

5094
06:47:18,520 --> 06:47:19,479
Yeah, this is it, man.

5095
06:47:19,479 --> 06:47:20,279
That's it.

5096
06:47:20,279 --> 06:47:24,759
30k.

5097
06:47:24,759 --> 06:47:25,639
I'll take it.

5098
06:47:25,639 --> 06:47:33,770
Unless there's something over here.

5099
06:47:33,770 --> 06:47:34,409
No, no way.

5100
06:47:35,049 --> 06:47:40,409
30k is enough for me.

5101
06:47:40,409 --> 06:47:41,290
That's fine.

5102
06:47:41,290 --> 06:47:44,500
Let's just check.

5103
06:47:44,500 --> 06:47:45,299
It's only August.

5104
06:47:45,939 --> 06:47:55,159
I don't think so.

5105
06:47:59,500 --> 06:48:00,459
No, that's it.

5106
06:48:00,459 --> 06:48:00,939
I'm out.

5107
06:48:04,119 --> 06:48:04,599
Yeah.

5108
06:48:04,599 --> 06:48:06,040
This is diamond right there.

5109
06:48:06,040 --> 06:48:06,360
All right.

5110
06:48:06,360 --> 06:48:08,409
25,000.

5111
06:48:08,409 --> 06:48:10,250
That puts me at 28k.

5112
06:48:10,970 --> 06:48:15,060
Do I not own the company yet?

5113
06:48:15,619 --> 06:48:20,740
I only have two more rounds left.

5114
06:48:20,740 --> 06:48:21,700
I don't own the company?

5115
06:48:22,340 --> 06:48:56,549
What were you doing all game?

5116
06:48:58,419 --> 06:48:59,139
All right.

5117
06:48:59,139 --> 06:49:00,740
I'm just going to try to bank money.

5118
06:49:00,740 --> 06:49:01,700
I'm going to try to bank money.

5119
06:49:02,709 --> 06:49:04,389
That's all that matters right at this very moment.

5120
06:49:05,189 --> 06:49:07,939
Only two rounds.

5121
06:49:39,979 --> 06:49:56,700
Diamond.

5122
06:49:56,700 --> 06:49:57,180
Hurry up.

5123
06:49:57,180 --> 06:50:25,029
Get some selling.

5124
06:50:25,029 --> 06:50:25,669
All right.

5125
06:50:25,669 --> 06:50:36,500
Store.

5126
06:50:36,500 --> 06:50:37,540
Sell on the right side.

5127
06:50:37,540 --> 06:50:42,869
I need a little bit of cash.

5128
06:50:42,869 --> 06:50:44,229
Actually sell everything over there.

5129
06:50:44,229 --> 06:50:45,029
Sell everything.

5130
06:50:45,029 --> 06:50:49,740
Got a buck.

5131
06:50:49,740 --> 06:50:55,459
Sell everything.

5132
06:50:55,459 --> 06:50:56,020
Okay.

5133
06:50:56,020 --> 06:50:56,659
Hold off.

5134
06:50:56,659 --> 06:50:58,939
I'm going to do double super silo over here.

5135
06:51:07,799 --> 06:51:17,299
Junk.

5136
06:51:17,299 --> 06:51:17,860
Is it worth it?

5137
06:51:18,819 --> 06:51:19,779
Don't tell me that wasn't worth it.

5138
06:51:21,540 --> 06:51:22,180
Was.

5139
06:51:22,180 --> 06:51:23,299
I think it's empty now.

5140
06:51:23,299 --> 06:51:51,340
Let's check.

5141
06:51:51,340 --> 06:51:56,790
I have 32 grand.

5142
06:51:56,790 --> 06:51:57,830
This is the final round.

5143
06:51:57,830 --> 06:51:58,630
This is it.

5144
06:51:58,630 --> 06:51:59,830
I have to win this auction.

5145
06:52:05,750 --> 06:52:06,389
All right.

5146
06:52:06,389 --> 06:52:07,900
I have to win this auction.

5147
06:52:07,900 --> 06:52:21,990
She's going to buy it.

5148
06:52:21,990 --> 06:52:23,909
Oh my god Blanche.

5149
06:52:23,909 --> 06:52:29,770
Blanche.

5150
06:52:29,770 --> 06:52:30,970
You're out of the game already.

5151
06:52:32,229 --> 06:52:33,029
Don't do that.

5152
06:52:33,750 --> 06:52:38,419
You're out of the game already.

5153
06:52:38,419 --> 06:52:39,299
You don't land.

5154
06:52:39,299 --> 06:52:40,099
Okay.

5155
06:52:40,099 --> 06:52:41,750
I'm sorry.

5156
06:52:41,750 --> 06:52:45,880
But like you landed on like park place in Monopoly.

5157
06:52:45,880 --> 06:52:48,279
You have two random ass properties.

5158
06:52:48,840 --> 06:52:49,720
I have boardwalk.

5159
06:52:50,840 --> 06:52:53,369
And I also own monopolies.

5160
06:52:53,369 --> 06:52:55,930
I own three monopolies.

5161
06:52:55,930 --> 06:52:56,810
The other person over here.

5162
06:52:56,810 --> 06:52:57,610
My friend over here.

5163
06:52:58,169 --> 06:52:59,849
Has three monopolies.

5164
06:52:59,849 --> 06:53:01,930
And you just took park place.

5165
06:53:02,729 --> 06:53:04,169
And you just won't concede the game.

5166
06:53:04,169 --> 06:53:05,689
And now you just like ruined it for me.

5167
06:53:06,630 --> 06:53:07,509
I just got blocked.

5168
06:53:07,509 --> 06:53:07,990
Yeah.

5169
06:53:07,990 --> 06:53:09,509
It's I hate that.

5170
06:53:09,509 --> 06:53:14,680
It's like the three of us playing.

5171
06:53:16,409 --> 06:53:19,770
You have like 30 bucks after buying park place.

5172
06:53:20,409 --> 06:53:38,979
Now don't throw.

5173
06:53:38,979 --> 06:53:40,419
I can probably still win.

5174
06:53:40,419 --> 06:53:42,819
There's probably one more auction.

5175
06:53:42,819 --> 06:53:51,099
Drink some water dude.

5176
06:53:51,099 --> 06:53:54,860
I drank like 150 ounces of water over the last 12 hours.

5177
06:53:56,540 --> 06:53:56,860
All right.

5178
06:53:56,860 --> 06:53:57,819
This is dog shit.

5179
06:53:57,819 --> 06:53:59,180
It's absolutely terrible.

5180
06:54:01,110 --> 06:54:03,430
But I just I got to make a little bit of cash.

5181
06:54:12,599 --> 06:54:13,319
It's so bad.

5182
06:54:35,259 --> 06:54:37,020
I'm just trying to make some at least a little bit of money.

5183
06:54:37,819 --> 06:54:38,939
Check far right for oil.

5184
06:54:39,580 --> 06:54:53,959
I think so.

5185
06:54:53,959 --> 06:54:55,000
There is gas over here.

5186
06:54:55,000 --> 06:54:55,880
But I don't think I can.

5187
06:54:55,880 --> 06:54:56,919
I'm not going to be able to get enough.

5188
06:54:56,919 --> 06:54:57,319
I don't think.

5189
06:54:58,040 --> 06:55:43,319
I just figured out that you can go like this with the mouse scroll.

5190
06:55:43,319 --> 06:55:43,880
I've been like.

5191
06:55:51,060 --> 06:55:51,860
That might be.

5192
06:55:51,860 --> 06:55:53,139
Actually, I don't care.

5193
06:57:28,439 --> 06:57:43,419
Yes, 10 grand and I get the bonuses.

5194
06:57:43,419 --> 06:57:43,979
Very nice.

5195
06:57:43,979 --> 06:57:44,380
All right.

5196
06:57:44,380 --> 06:57:44,939
11 grand.

5197
06:57:44,939 --> 06:57:47,189
What does that put me at?

5198
06:57:47,189 --> 06:57:48,069
41.

5199
06:57:48,069 --> 06:57:54,659
What happened to um what happened to Blanche?

5200
06:57:56,229 --> 06:57:58,150
Oh yeah right.

5201
06:57:58,150 --> 06:58:08,040
Blanche you you bought park place and then you two or three turns later got up to go

5202
06:58:08,040 --> 06:58:14,340
to the bathroom and get a drink and then started talking to somebody in the hallway

5203
06:58:14,340 --> 06:58:16,180
at whatever family get together or at.

5204
06:58:17,669 --> 06:58:24,540
And you never come back and sit down at the table and then you sit on the couch

5205
06:58:24,540 --> 06:58:31,529
and the TV is on and then we just kind of say let's stop playing.

5206
06:58:31,529 --> 06:58:33,959
I guess it's over.

5207
06:58:34,599 --> 06:58:35,560
The game's over.

5208
06:58:35,560 --> 06:58:40,659
It's a tie plus two farming you know.

5209
06:58:41,380 --> 06:58:41,779
All right.

5210
06:58:41,779 --> 06:58:42,900
So do I win?

5211
06:58:45,400 --> 06:58:46,439
That was it folks.

5212
06:58:46,439 --> 06:58:47,159
I'm out of land.

5213
06:58:47,159 --> 06:58:49,319
Now let's see who would become the new mayor.

5214
06:58:49,319 --> 06:58:50,599
Did I actually not do it?

5215
06:58:51,240 --> 06:58:55,720
There is no winner yet.

5216
06:58:55,720 --> 06:58:59,479
This means the stockholder with the smallest share and the least money

5217
06:59:00,540 --> 06:59:02,139
in case of a draw will have to go.

5218
06:59:02,779 --> 06:59:08,139
But Blanche will have to pack up and leave and we will auction off their 11 percent shares.

5219
06:59:09,689 --> 06:59:18,540
Meet me at the stock auction to decide who gets the remaining 11 percent of the stock.

5220
06:59:18,540 --> 06:59:21,099
Oh I thought I was trying to take out like a hundred thousand dollar loan.

5221
06:59:23,799 --> 06:59:24,119
Hey.

5222
06:59:24,759 --> 06:59:29,319
Oh do you want it?

5223
06:59:29,319 --> 06:59:31,240
Hey hey oh hey Ricardo you want it?

5224
06:59:31,240 --> 06:59:32,279
Hey Ricardo you want it?

5225
06:59:33,000 --> 06:59:33,400
All right.

5226
06:59:33,400 --> 06:59:36,360
I'm gonna I'll get Ricardo do you want you wanted some shares?

5227
06:59:36,360 --> 06:59:41,959
I'm the mayor.

5228
06:59:41,959 --> 06:59:44,919
Great job you've secured more than half of the town's shares.

5229
06:59:46,500 --> 06:59:49,700
You've won the campaign and you'll be the new mayor.

5230
06:59:49,700 --> 06:59:51,380
I've got something special for you as a reward.

5231
06:59:51,380 --> 06:59:52,419
Meet me at the town hall.

5232
06:59:53,220 --> 07:00:00,020
What do you mean land auction?

5233
07:00:00,020 --> 07:00:00,500
What is this?

5234
07:00:01,299 --> 07:00:02,819
I have a special present for you.

5235
07:00:03,540 --> 07:00:07,619
See that island over there?

5236
07:00:07,619 --> 07:00:09,139
It's yours to mine.

5237
07:00:09,779 --> 07:00:15,340
We're done.

5238
07:00:15,340 --> 07:00:16,779
Let's go back outside.

5239
07:00:19,779 --> 07:00:21,139
Private island?

5240
07:00:21,139 --> 07:00:21,459
Mine?

5241
07:00:23,880 --> 07:00:24,360
Serious?

5242
07:00:27,779 --> 07:00:30,020
Are you ready for your final challenge?

5243
07:00:30,740 --> 07:02:16,099
Pilo.

5244
07:02:52,299 --> 07:04:12,970
Oh my god.

5245
07:04:12,970 --> 07:04:13,770
Hurry hurry.

5246
07:05:00,900 --> 07:05:12,459
Oh my god.

5247
07:05:12,459 --> 07:05:13,500
That's 100.

5248
07:05:13,500 --> 07:05:14,619
I'm gonna break the counter.

5249
07:05:14,619 --> 07:05:15,580
I can't count that high.

5250
07:05:20,330 --> 07:05:21,770
Dude I can't count this high.

5251
07:05:35,610 --> 07:05:36,569
I'm gonna break the counter.

5252
07:05:37,209 --> 07:05:37,930
What?

5253
07:05:37,930 --> 07:05:39,369
105?

5254
07:05:39,369 --> 07:05:40,810
Did I win?

5255
07:05:41,529 --> 07:05:42,169
Who cares?

5256
07:05:48,549 --> 07:05:49,110
110?

5257
07:05:50,150 --> 07:05:53,159
I made a hundred thousand.

5258
07:05:53,880 --> 07:05:54,599
He's tripping.

5259
07:05:57,240 --> 07:05:58,040
Congratulations.

5260
07:05:58,040 --> 07:05:58,680
You've won the game.

5261
07:05:58,680 --> 07:06:01,159
You can now play turmoil on expert mode.

5262
07:06:01,159 --> 07:06:04,040
Where the characters have special powers and the competition is tougher.

5263
07:06:04,599 --> 07:06:05,900
Give it a try.

5264
07:06:05,900 --> 07:06:06,380
Great job.

5265
07:06:06,380 --> 07:06:07,819
You've worked like a horse.

5266
07:06:07,819 --> 07:06:09,099
You get some horseshoes.

5267
07:06:10,380 --> 07:06:12,139
Me and the moles are very happy for you.

5268
07:06:13,900 --> 07:06:14,779
Party time.

5269
07:06:14,779 --> 07:06:17,619
I'm sure you'll buy everyone around.

5270
07:06:17,619 --> 07:06:18,259
Well done.

5271
07:06:18,259 --> 07:06:20,180
I'm sure you'll make almost as good a mayor as me.

5272
07:06:20,819 --> 07:06:25,290
My hat is off to you in your 24-carat oil mining performance.

5273
07:06:25,290 --> 07:06:28,419
Your performance was even stronger than my biceps.

5274
07:06:29,380 --> 07:06:30,740
I'm gonna miss our trips together.

5275
07:06:31,700 --> 07:06:34,020
Before you go, test your skills in expert mode.

5276
07:06:34,020 --> 07:06:37,939
Pay a final visit to my bank to check out the overall statistics of your campaign.

5277
07:06:38,819 --> 07:06:39,540
Oh, okay.

5278
07:06:39,540 --> 07:06:40,259
That's interesting.

5279
07:06:40,819 --> 07:06:42,229
Let's check it out.

5280
07:06:46,869 --> 07:06:53,619
Oh, not one million.

5281
07:06:54,180 --> 07:06:54,900
So close.

5282
07:06:57,130 --> 07:07:01,849
All these goddamn blockbuster late fees that screwed everything up.

5283
07:07:01,849 --> 07:07:02,729
I would have had over a million.

5284
07:07:03,290 --> 07:07:12,360
Sorry.

5285
07:07:12,360 --> 07:07:13,479
Graphs not available.

5286
07:07:16,220 --> 07:07:19,580
707,000 barrels sold.

5287
07:07:20,950 --> 07:07:22,470
761,000 earned.

5288
07:07:23,459 --> 07:07:25,380
Average price of $1.08 per barrel.

5289
07:07:25,380 --> 07:07:26,259
That's pretty good.

5290
07:07:34,200 --> 07:07:35,959
110 per barrel on the right.

5291
07:07:38,310 --> 07:07:39,590
I think this is pretty good.

5292
07:07:39,590 --> 07:07:40,470
That's actually pretty good.

5293
07:07:41,349 --> 07:07:42,069
Right side.

5294
07:07:42,069 --> 07:07:43,909
Oh, right Twix ended up winning.

5295
07:07:46,889 --> 07:07:47,290
I went.

5296
07:07:47,290 --> 07:07:48,009
That's funny.

5297
07:07:48,009 --> 07:07:48,970
Not by very much though.

5298
07:07:49,909 --> 07:07:50,310
What's the...

5299
07:07:50,310 --> 07:07:51,029
Oh, this is total.

5300
07:07:58,299 --> 07:08:00,299
You've streamed longer than the viewer count.

5301
07:08:01,099 --> 07:08:04,150
That's funny.

5302
07:08:04,150 --> 07:08:04,470
All right.

5303
07:08:04,470 --> 07:08:05,430
This is interesting.

5304
07:08:07,209 --> 07:08:08,330
Poor dowsers.

5305
07:08:09,049 --> 07:08:09,930
I didn't do...

5306
07:08:09,930 --> 07:08:10,409
I didn't...

5307
07:08:10,409 --> 07:08:14,090
Okay, after the tutorial zone, I didn't buy them ever again.

5308
07:08:14,810 --> 07:08:18,569
What was the thing I spent the most money on besides pipes?

5309
07:08:20,979 --> 07:08:21,779
Pipe upgrades?

5310
07:08:21,779 --> 07:08:22,099
Pipes?

5311
07:08:22,099 --> 07:08:27,209
I think I feel like I did that a little less ideal than I could have.

5312
07:08:28,630 --> 07:08:29,029
Rigs?

5313
07:08:30,470 --> 07:08:31,189
Valve usage?

5314
07:08:31,750 --> 07:08:32,709
Half of those were mistakes.

5315
07:08:35,860 --> 07:08:36,259
Moles?

5316
07:08:36,259 --> 07:08:37,060
I thought that would be more.

5317
07:08:37,700 --> 07:08:41,509
I spent more money on moles than silos.

5318
07:08:41,509 --> 07:08:46,360
That's kind of crazy.

5319
07:08:46,360 --> 07:08:47,959
I spam so many moles.

5320
07:08:48,759 --> 07:08:49,639
Screenshot.

5321
07:08:51,930 --> 07:08:55,689
Oh, cool.

5322
07:08:56,330 --> 07:09:00,229
What's the thing I spent the least on besides dowsers?

5323
07:09:00,790 --> 07:09:05,450
Tier 3 silo upgrade?

5324
07:09:06,090 --> 07:09:09,419
Valve usage?

5325
07:09:10,459 --> 07:09:10,939
Pretty good.

5326
07:09:11,750 --> 07:09:11,990
Cool.

5327
07:09:13,659 --> 07:09:14,220
Really cool.

5328
07:09:14,220 --> 07:09:14,860
That was awesome.

5329
07:09:15,580 --> 07:09:17,099
That was such a fun game.

5330
07:09:17,099 --> 07:09:18,700
And I think there's DLC.

5331
07:09:19,500 --> 07:09:22,680
Maybe I'll play the DLC another time.

5332
07:09:23,669 --> 07:09:28,250
Stream is not over yet.

5333
07:09:28,250 --> 07:09:36,200
What's the countdown to beat the old record?

5334
07:09:36,200 --> 07:09:36,919
13 and what?

5335
07:09:37,479 --> 07:09:38,779
About a half an hour.

5336
07:09:39,639 --> 07:09:40,680
Dude, I got to beat the old record.

5337
07:09:41,240 --> 07:09:49,590
What does the DLC even look like?

5338
07:09:49,590 --> 07:09:50,759
How do I get there?

5339
07:09:50,759 --> 07:09:57,299
Start a new campaign.

5340
07:09:57,299 --> 07:09:57,939
Okay.

5341
07:09:57,939 --> 07:10:02,860
Heat is on.

5342
07:10:02,860 --> 07:10:03,819
I just want to see.

5343
07:10:05,529 --> 07:10:08,599
Lots of oil.

5344
07:10:08,599 --> 07:10:09,080
New area.

5345
07:10:12,549 --> 07:10:13,189
I just want to see.

5346
07:10:13,189 --> 07:10:13,909
Welcome to my town.

5347
07:10:13,909 --> 07:10:14,709
I'm the mayor here.

5348
07:10:14,709 --> 07:10:15,509
Is this book, is it me?

5349
07:10:16,310 --> 07:10:18,279
What happened to me?

5350
07:10:19,000 --> 07:10:22,340
Holy shit.

5351
07:10:25,099 --> 07:10:25,979
Wow.

5352
07:10:25,979 --> 07:10:26,220
Okay.

5353
07:10:28,810 --> 07:10:29,610
Yeah, I just wanted to look.

5354
07:10:30,409 --> 07:10:32,569
Start with 200 grand.

5355
07:10:33,290 --> 07:10:35,689
Well, that's a lot of content.

5356
07:10:35,689 --> 07:10:36,090
That's cool.

5357
07:10:38,939 --> 07:10:41,580
Yeah, they're all, we all start with like 200,000.

5358
07:10:42,540 --> 07:10:44,779
Okay.

5359
07:10:44,779 --> 07:10:45,180
Yeah.

5360
07:10:45,180 --> 07:10:46,459
No, I'm not doing it.

5361
07:10:46,459 --> 07:10:47,060
All right.

5362
07:10:47,060 --> 07:10:48,580
What can we do for like 20, 30 minutes?

5363
07:10:49,619 --> 07:10:52,409
That was a very, very enjoyable experience.

5364
07:10:53,049 --> 07:10:56,229
What do we got here?

5365
07:10:59,540 --> 07:11:01,619
No, I'm not doing a tier list.

5366
07:11:01,619 --> 07:11:02,020
Not now.

5367
07:11:06,060 --> 07:11:07,020
20 minutes till dawn?

5368
07:11:08,380 --> 07:11:09,099
Not a bad idea.

5369
07:11:09,900 --> 07:11:11,180
Yeah, we'll go back to that.

5370
07:11:11,180 --> 07:11:12,459
Although that's a little intense.

5371
07:11:13,340 --> 07:11:18,700
Is that too intense?

5372
07:11:31,419 --> 07:11:31,979
Maybe not.

5373
07:11:32,700 --> 07:11:34,299
I think I can just probably sit there with my mouth open.

5374
07:11:37,299 --> 07:11:38,099
Let's try it.

5375
07:11:38,099 --> 07:11:38,900
Let's see if I can do it.

5376
07:11:39,459 --> 07:11:44,619
That was really cool though.

5377
07:11:44,619 --> 07:11:45,639
What a great game.
