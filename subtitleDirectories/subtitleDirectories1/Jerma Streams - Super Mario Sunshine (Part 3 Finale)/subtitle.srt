1
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:11,320
Hi, what's up? How are you? Yeah, we can we can skip the formalities here. We're doing Super Mario Sunshine the final chapter

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:20,489
You guys already know we need a pre-stream wink. No, I I I did it already

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,350
I did the pre-stream wink already

4
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,609
They did it in chat. Well now now now we do it now we do a real one

5
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,479
The wink stuff is so awkward. Well, i'll have you know

6
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,060
It's going away permanently. It's gone as of sunday

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Sunday is the last day for winks

8
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,579
no longer can you make me awkwardly turn a camera on and like look over like a deer in headlights and

9
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,980
Wink blink and then turn the camera off. That's a god. It's gone on sunday

10
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,060
They're gonna be

11
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,060
Very significantly reduced in price

12
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,700
It's gonna be a whole thing

13
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
That's sunday. It's the last day

14
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,099
Your voice is high pitched

15
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,370
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,280
It it shouldn't be

17
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,519
My thing has turned off. How is it? What do you mean high pitch? What are you talking about?

18
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,280
Turn the compressor. There's no compressor. That's the same settings from you literally yesterday. What are you talking about?

19
00:01:52,459 --> 00:02:00,620
I haven't changed shit

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,299
We have 58

21
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,240
Shines in mario sunshine. I'm gonna finish it today. I could have finished it yesterday, but I was like

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,479
I didn't want to just rush through it. I know I probably could have finished the game in like an hour or two

23
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,050
But i'd like to take my time with the game. I've never played it so we're gonna go

24
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:26,830
Erase

25
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,199
Do a new game start new game

26
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,120
All shines and blue coins or else hold on. I gotta mute these things. Uh, I gotta move my microphone. I don't want to like

27
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,219
All right. There we go. Okay

28
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,259
so

29
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,259
With the last thing I did

30
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,219
What is left to do?

31
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,889
But I could very slowly

32
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,629
Very cautiously do

33
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,669
We have

34
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,139
Deontah village

35
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,740
I think I have seven stars in every single one of these the only ones I don't have are the coins

36
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,189
Oh, what about here?

37
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,550
Airstrip there's only one on the air. How do I get to the airstrip though?

38
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:33,319
Didn't somebody say that the airstrip that this was like the weird yoshi thing, right?

39
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,729
Like what's over there?

40
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,729
somebody else's game footage

41
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,780
That'd be so

42
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,939
Mad about well, no, there's you know how you could tell if this was somebody else's game footage

43
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,319
As if I was back here and just fucking hanging up

44
00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,280
Oh look out. I gotta get that

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Oh, I guess I can go this way

46
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,430
All right, that's kind of cool

47
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,550
So no like i'm i'm in i'm leaning i'm forward. We're not leaning but i'm microphones up here

48
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:11,710
What's over here?

49
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:20,220
This is the thing with the yoshi, right?

50
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,779
I need to get yoshi over here and somebody linked me a video

51
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,220
They said this was horrible and they linked me a video. I didn't watch the video

52
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,509
Put out his fire

53
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:43,579
I was shipwrecked and washed up here three years ago. I have to think about the far shore, but I can't swim

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,459
I've never left this island. Isn't that just awful?

55
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,430
I mean that is pretty awful

56
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,589
All right for what?

57
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:55,550
Okay

58
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,350
There's a boat right there

59
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,350
Should I get the egg?

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,389
Get the egg onto the boat put egg here

61
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,949
Get fruit

62
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:11,550
on boat again

63
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,689
Holy shit, this is gonna take this is gonna take forever

64
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:29,230
Okay, uh, where does this where does this boat go? Where does this boat end up?

65
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:43,740
Why did I fall off?

66
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,649
Where's this go?

67
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,410
Oh shit, there's a banana

68
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,769
Should I get the banana?

69
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,740
Should I get should I get the banana? I think i'm gonna try to get this banana

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Why is there a banana up here? Makes no sense

71
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,889
Why would there be banana here? What's this? Oh shit

72
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:14,160
What?

73
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
All right. I have I got the banana

74
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,339
Should I eat it?

75
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,680
Redeemed we at home. We actually

76
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:44,939
It's for bringing yoshi over. He needs it. Wait, I have you now you're stuck for three years

77
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,399
So

78
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,399
Wait, should I leave this?

79
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:01,019
But there are bananas at the market

80
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
This is this is there's no reason for me to do this

81
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,800
Does that despawn?

82
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,319
All right. I gotta let me get a yoshi. Let me figure this out. There's a yoshi of egg up here, right?

83
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,629
Buy local bananas

84
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,899
All right. What do you want? Okay, you want one of those?

85
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,470
I can get you one of those

86
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,149
Can I not pick you up?

87
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,899
You can't pick the egg up. All right

88
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,899
Not those things on these trees

89
00:07:49,339 --> 00:08:13,279
Give me one. Oh, there was one right next to me. All right. Here we go. So

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
Get on boat

91
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,040
Yoshi, we get it. We gotta get on that boat you and me

92
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:30,329
How do we get on that boat?

93
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:32,480
Do you hate this game yet?

94
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,320
No, what?

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
Why why would I hate this game?

96
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,179
All right. So

97
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,179
I'm thinking can we do it from here?

98
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:55,769
No, I can't reach that boat

99
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,120
Should I get on the okay? Wait, I can get on that boat

100
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,320
So get on that boat and then jump from that boat to the other boat

101
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,120
Wait a minute. Does that actually go all the way? All right, I get on the boat

102
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:18,379
I got I get plenty of food

103
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,460
You're gonna push me off. What the fuck? This is not like a party prank time. Get the fuck out of here

104
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
I got my phone in my pocket you asshole

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Wait, it's very funny. You're gonna pay for that fucking new iphone x

106
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:55,629
God damn it

107
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,629
All right, I can I can get another one

108
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:32,399
Please don't do this. It takes a half an hour. What? All right, which boat should I get on? Just stay on this one?

109
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,840
Okay

110
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,830
I get off. Wait a minute. Don't touch it

111
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:49,470
Oh my god, I forgot. It's like if you

112
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,820
It's that fucking yoshi can't touch any water. I forgot it even if it's shallow. It doesn't matter

113
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,990
Right when I jumped I was like that's knee deep. No

114
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,769
video games from

115
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,190
2005 and backwards

116
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,559
Insta die water. I forgot

117
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, you want a fucking pineapple god. I had it too. I just didn't really there when it started make him suffer

118
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,279

I'm doing this and i'm gonna get this is the i'm finishing my chores

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,139
It's too early to be this mad. No, it's not it's it's it's never too early

121
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,179
I want the blood to flow through my veins

122
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,990
I want to be I don't want to have I want to have like blood pumping through my body

123
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:14,889
That's how you know, you're healthy. He's coming back to life

124
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,730
As opposed to no blood

125
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:26,350
All right, let's get on this

126
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:32,009
Fuck you buddy

127
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,090
He almost did it too. It was close

128
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:44,889
And turn it around what's okay if yoshi gets sprayed by water does he die

129
00:12:45,610 --> 00:13:02,960
Yoshi yoshi conserve your energy

130
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,559
Wait this fruit on the island, right?

131
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,559
Okay, what's the good opportunity to jump?

132
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,440
Is there um

133
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,950
I'm not close enough

134
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:29,320
Not close enough. Not close enough

135
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
All right. I made it. I need I need these

136
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,450
How do I get off yoshi?

137
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:48,029
Okay like that

138
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,529
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me game

139
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,230
What on earth are you doing?

140
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,470
All right. I'm ready. So now I gotta ride the boat over there

141
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,789
I so I have to

142
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:22,320
It's a long ride

143
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,970
To the tower. Wait, is the banana on that tower still?

144
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,769
With banana on that tower

145
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,360
It better be

146
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
It better be

147
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Does it matter what boat I get on what does it have to be can I get on this one?

148
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,159
No, that one just goes back right? It has to be this one

149
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,950
Wait, what I just walked two feet and yo yoshi already is hungry again

150
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:09,000
Hold on. All right. I'm gonna get on this one

151
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,799
Wait, what I have to wait till it comes back. What was the point of getting on the island yoshi?

152
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:21,399
Why are you so fucking hungry? What what's going on? Is he in the sun?

153
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:37,629
Here we go. Ready?

154
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:41,970
Fucking too much. Oh my god. It's hard to determine

155
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:52,919
I'm so paranoid of going to the water. I was shooting the fucking thing

156
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,809
Just skip this

157
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,600
All right. So the youtube so the person that donated last night said this is the worst thing in the entire game

158
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,200
Should I just not do this? Is there any reason to do this?

159
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,759
Besides like I got to the island. Hooray

160
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:36,429
Is there any reason what's over there? It's gonna be one blue coin. What do you want?

161
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:49,710
All right. I'm doing this one more time. It's too early to be this angry

162
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,629
They gave I got I got a youtube video linked that was like dude, please for the love of god

163
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:00,750
Don't do it the way you're supposed to do it. It's the worst thing in the entire game, please god

164
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,629
Just do the exploit. Please. There's a youtube video tutorial

165
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:21,789
I didn't even watch it

166
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,960
I'm gonna get it this time

167
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
The issue is do do not do the yoshi

168
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,119
a herring jump

169
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,720

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,750
What if I don't get on the roof?

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:25,019
What if I don't get on the roof? Can I get with my tongue? Oh my god. I have to get on this one

Wait and wait, I gotta wait. I gotta wait for this

All right. We're gonna wait till we're gonna wait till he's almost dead and then we're gonna eat it

198
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
There's a warning right? Doesn't it go like

199
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:47,839

There's a million of them. All right, just make the jump. I gotta make this jump. This is the biggest jump of the day

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Just a regular jump. Nothing crazy

202
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Just a regular jump. It gets close

00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,680

Why did it do that?

209
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,970
Why did it do that?

210
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,170
Why did it do that?

211
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,170
Nobody tell me what happened. I didn't do anything

212
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,470
It's just fucking through. It just just pushed it shoved me off. I didn't do anything. I was standing right in the middle

213
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:51,880
What?

214
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,359
Oh my god, it was right fucking there

215
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,019
I I did it. I did it. I don't have to do this again

216
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,539
I

217
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,039
I have to move with the boat

218
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,940
It's a fucking boat

219
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,220
Why I have you mean I have to steer with the boat my body

What the fuck

222
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,049
That's not fair. I was there

223
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,339
I did it. I was there. It was over

224
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,630
I was here. I was actually here

225
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:46,349
Move the move with the boat

226
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,799
I didn't move with the boat last time

227
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:59,950
I just stood there and the wind was pushing me a little bit but not like a full like three or four feet

228
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,039
That was very clearly like uh, that wasn't like a oh be careful that you're starting to move it was like

234
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,599
Hey move in the boat, right? What's going on here?

235
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:59,819
What's going on here? I gotta be in the front of the boat

236
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:21,759
Wink with the boat

237
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,400

238
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,160
I love when people it's just so funny just seeing the one person just like writes just just be so mad at this

239
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,809
All right. We're good

240
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:49,440
I got it

241
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Jesus christ, this is so

242
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Okay, this is the one right this is the one this is the one right here turn

243
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:21,549
I can't believe it

244
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:46,460
I can't believe it. There's a lot of winks going on right now. I thought I fell off the boat. Sorry. That was a double

245
00:25:46,859 --> 00:26:00,299
Okay, get

246
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,299
Jesus dude. I'm not doing that

247
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:29,279
This is stupid. I have to jump from the roof

248
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:40,119
I last time I tried that I I couldn't I can't get on the roof from here press y please

249
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:51,200
Why?

250
00:26:51,200 --> 00:27:08,910
I I don't care. I'm not doing this. I didn't want to be on the roof because the roof fight

251
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,349
That threw me off the fucking roof. Give me the exploit. What's the exploit?

252
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:22,920
Where's that? I'm going to the donations from yesterday. Where's where's the exploit to beat this? Let's watch it

253
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,599
Okay, get the yoshi. All right, get on yoshi

254
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,329
Go to uh dancing dancing. There's a dancing guy

255
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,539
I don't know what they're doing. You're jumping over

256
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,700
Uh, what was the point of that?

257
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,940
Where are we? We're over here. We're we're getting red

258
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,920
Wait, what is going on?

259
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:59,880
Okay, he just fell through the earth

260
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,799
So you eat a hot pepper and you jump off. It's this is immediately when the hot pepper goes towards you

261
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,599
And it floats in the air and then you run into this guy a couple times

262
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,009
And then you you run into the wall in the back

263
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,299
What?

264
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:37,450
Okay, i'm ready. This is you doing your chores, but you're putting your laundry under your bed

265
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,289
No, that's not true

266
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:46,730
That's not true because this would be way way less than 30 minutes already

267
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:49,609
It would be like two

268
00:28:49,769 --> 00:29:07,390
Okay, give me

269
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,549
Uh, well i'm gonna go to the market

270
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,819
Okay, yoshi come here. There's the hot pepper

271
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:21,309
Can we see this?

272
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:25,069
Cheater cheater cheater. I'm writing this in caps because i'm angry yelling but what?

273
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:34,839
Wait, hold on. I'm writing this in caps because i'm angry or yelling

274
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm not angry or yelling but merely because I think it increases the chances of you reading it

275
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,359
There in one of the islands there's a mountainside with a secret pipe or the secret stage that you need the rocket nozzle to reach

276
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:49,740
I mean it worked but I that's

277
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,019
Just hold on

278
00:29:55,019 --> 00:30:00,119
It did increase the chances

279
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,720
Well, I thought I was gonna say like dude, you can't do this unless you have a different nozzle

280
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,039
I was concerned that it was it was it had to be a different nozzle

281
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:13,720
Like dude, dude, don't waste your time man

282
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,559
Like you you need the rocket nozzle after you jump off yoshi and you fall down to that pit

283
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,640
No, I don't know. Okay, here we go. Let's try it. Here we go. Let's do it. So here we go

284
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,599
Let me watch it again. All right floating floating pepper is there he then runs

285
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:35,819
He knocks into the fruits and it makes the guy go. Oh

286
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:38,220
And then he turns

287
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,079
And he just goes

288
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,960
It's this little spot right? Okay right here

289
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,599
You guys have freaked

290
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:20,430
I did it. I did it. I did it. What did I do wrong?

291
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,170
I did

292
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,519
Wait, you have to keep jumping you have to keep jumping

293
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,259
Okay

294
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,779
I just spit everywhere. All right, let's do it again

295
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:53,240
Now I got now i'm interested. What does he want for a fruit? Yeah, you want the expensive shit, don't you?

296
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
I can't believe it. Whatever

297
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
It passed they patched it yesterday

298
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,670
Well, at least I know where it is I don't think it's gonna be that hard to do this again

299
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,710
I said I didn't know how to keep jumping see what happened was

300
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,190
Uh, I stopped the video

301
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,160
Because I saw him jump a couple times and I thought he was just kind of bored jumping

302
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
You know what i'm talking about?

303
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,960
bored jumping where you just do this because

304
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,640
If you're just you don't want to walk walking is boring but going like this is fun

305
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:57,180
Okay, here we go. No, stop eating that one. What are you dumb?

306
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:42,090
Get in there. Where am I? What where did I do it? Okay. I did it. I got I got I got it. All right

307
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,000
Where where am I what?

308
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:54,380
Where is this?

309
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,219
Am I actually in the sewer

310
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:19,440
How do I get out of here? I clipped into the sewer

311
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:31,610
Get me the fuck out of here. I went too high

312
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:52,679
Let me watch this video again. There's this part. All right, so he's down he's going left

313
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,119
Just little short hops left

314
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,789
There's a little island. He's going over towards that green island

315
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:03,849
Okay, then he goes under the boat

316
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:34,809
Okay

317
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:42,460
There it is right there right there going going going going. Ah cheat harder. I'm trying to cheat as hard as I can

318
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:55,559
I'm trying to get in there. Well, there's no shame. No, there is no shame right now

319
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:12,840
Do it normally you normie wouldn't the normie way be to do it normally?

320
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,519
Isn't that what isn't that what normal is?

321
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,369
Come on get in there. I did it twice already

322
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:38,380
That's literally what he said but he was calling me a normie

323
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,980
So he said I should do it because that's what i'm a normie. So I should do it the normie way

324
00:37:42,619 --> 00:38:01,980
Is it normal?

325
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,840
No, what the god why did it did the jump the second jump?

326
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,840
It did like the second bigger jump. I was trying to just time it so I wasn't doing it

327
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:28,000
If you bunny hop you end up doing the ha

328
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
And jump wicked high you can't bunny hop

329
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,559
Yoshi's dead

330
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:49,639
He's not how much time do I have before?

331
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,530
I'm doing this one more time. Then i'm playing again

332
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,269
Is it his last try final try?

333
00:38:58,429 --> 00:39:44,699
And you got you can't I cannot have him do the second jump guys. Um, you hit the kill plane

334
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:10,780
The red coins of the lake invisible laser wall

335
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,980
Was I not doing jumping fast enough?

336
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:27,559
Do it normally no, I I don't know. I don't know either i'm not sure

337
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,880
Wait, I need a banana

338
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,219
Are there bananas over here? Are the bananas where's there a good banana?

339
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,750
We have bananas at home

340
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,750
Yeah, that that's the the grocery store shuffle

341
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,639
Oh, these bananas look good

342
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:59,039
Jeremy there there are seven bananas that are getting to be overripe at the house right fucking now

343
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:02,969
Oh, oh right, right, right

344
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:31,159
Banana spotted guys. He's not a chat anymore. He cannot lift nor can he play a kid's game

345
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,440
What did you just say?

346
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:42,570
What did he say?

347
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,320
Didn't think I could play a kid's game

348
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,809
How to get proven wrong

349
00:41:48,809 --> 00:42:03,929
Mr

350
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:10,039
Jump jump. Okay, let's go. I'm just jumped off the edge

351
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:13,960
All right red coins of the lake red coins of the lake

352
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:20,030
The thing you have shoes on yoshi or you would instantly disintegrate

353
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:42,260
You can't walk on you can't walk on ropes of the yoshi. I think that's the first time i've ever tried to do that

354
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:55,650
It's not a banana. Is it you tried that? Did I try that already when did I?

355
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,159
Because that was like two days ago. That may that may have been like that should have that's like 10 years

356
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,179
In fucking streamer time

357
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:11,730
Do I even need yoshi for this? I I just saw yoshi and it was like oh

358
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:17,090
Immediately do because I just go go get fruit bring back warcraft fetch quest to get yoshi

359
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:29,539
I don't even need yoshi for this

360
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:59,730
He's gonna go to the lake. How's that not hitting them all mario broke his foot

361
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:03,550
He's all right

362
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,550
Okay, red coins of the lake

363
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,869
It's it's it's not poisonous, right?

364
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:14,190
No, this what what the why would I get what? All right, i'm i'm mad at me not at anything else

365
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,389
The name of this mission is called coins in the lake

366
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,550
Let me go get the guy that melts like fucking candy bar

367
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,179
When he touches water I got the wrong fucking nozzle for this, too

368
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:45,309
I gotta get the fucking other nozzle. Maybe I can just jump on the bug but that's I could just

369
00:44:45,949 --> 00:45:10,670
What was that? That's a fucking illusion. Oh, it's right. It's a it's not in the water. It's above

370
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:25,230
I just got i'm the guy that would jump head first into the water. That's the mirage there it is

371
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:40,610
Clean crystal cliff fiji water bottles. Oh my god. I can't even no germa. Those are rocks

372
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:52,059
But they're not okay. There's

373
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:59,039
Probably up higher probably if I was there i'd be higher

374
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,650
Okay

375
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:34,559
They're definitely all the way up could they be in the line is definitely in right here. No

376
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:42,590
None of them are up here though. They must all just be down in the lake

377
00:46:42,670 --> 00:47:01,039
Do I know about the infinite rocket launcher glitch? I don't uh, but as you've seen for the last 25 straight minutes

378
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,019
I i'm not going to just try to do an exploit. That's hard to do

379
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:30,320
I've not seen a single other red coin in this lake coins in the lake coins of the lake

380
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:50,780
This is I see two

381
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:57,139
Got a super coin. This is so frustrating. Just push the buttons

382
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,730
All right, fine

383
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,090
It didn't work

384
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,289
Ban that guy

385
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:20,780
Is there any shit down here? No, it's all

386
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:28,559
Where the fuck are all these things? Oh, there's a couple over here

387
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,480
Oh god, there's no one down in the lake

388
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:45,539
I got lied to it didn't say in the lake. Yes, it did. That's what that's what the facebook post said

389
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:42,429
Or where they don't sum up in the windmill over there. No nothing in the lake. Let's head back that way

390
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:03,139
Get the flower is there gonna flower in this one? There's no fire in this is there

391
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,650

392
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,489
Watch out, dude, dude, dude

393
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:57,840
John, holy shit. What was that? We got one over there. Leave me the fuck alone. Leave me the fuck alone

394
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:09,980
I don't even want those. I just want the red ones. Excuse me. Excuse me. Get your head out of the way

395
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:17,300
What do I do with this guy? That's what you do about that guy

396
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,099
Crush his skull with your legs

397
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:32,940
Well, this sucks

398
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,340

00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:45,179
Come on. Oh

401
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:53,139
Okay, i'm good. I'm good. Everything's fine. We're almost done. I need two more. There's one two over there, right?

402
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:04,860
It's a blue one, too

403
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,860
That was it's moving around. It's like it's a it's a different speed. It's a weird speed

404
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:18,289
I said I didn't see it. I didn't see it. The camera made me see it. Where was that?

405
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:28,139
Where the fuck was that? I just saw it. It's right there. Okay, come here get it

406
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,639

411
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:01,579
How long streamed it up 54 minutes?

412
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,400
Hopefully I didn't miss anything. You didn't don't look don't watch

413
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:18,099
Bounced

414
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:32,159
Fucking bounced off the goddamn thing. Why does mario have bounced physics yodel laugh?

415
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Stop

416
00:53:44,210 --> 00:54:03,780
Give me the coin wait, is that I clean that is this cleanable? What the fuck is this?

417
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:27,940
All right, where's that coin? I'm just gonna run into it. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Where is it?

418
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:33,809
I don't know

419
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:44,159
Oh

420
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,500
Uh

421
00:54:46,500 --> 00:55:19,980
The fuck he got all eight coins. Yep. Yeah, I gave up on the blue coin. Yeah, I did I have to move on

422
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,460
I can't just keep failing at something

423
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:52,989
That being said let's try the yoshi skip one more time banana. I can get you one of those blue

424
00:55:53,550 --> 00:56:18,820
Blue coin over there

425
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:27,659
You know what to do. See that's what I have to be careful of is it one one two one two three

426
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,440
So what if I do one two one two?

427
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:34,159
One two one

428
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,519
Two one two one two. I think that's the way I think that's the way it is

429
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,760
I think that's the way you do it

430
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:58,480
Here we go. One two pause one two pause

431
00:57:14,929 --> 00:57:19,250
God, you know, i've got to give some I gotta hand it to you're a speed runner of a game

432
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:25,260
And you have to do this the first time you go over here and do this

433
00:57:26,139 --> 00:57:31,679
And if you do what I just did right there you turn off the whole thing

434
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,880
One two pause one two pause one two never do a third

435
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:23,889
One two pause one two pause. What the fuck is he doing? Oh, sorry guys. I i'm back

00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,670
Um, I had to go pee

And I dropped my controller on the ground and it was accidentally holding right stick

438
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:54,849

00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:57,150

446
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:30,400
Fuck you what?

447
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,739
It's the kill plane

448
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,699
In the movie he's doing in the movie he's jumping one

449
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,030

450
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,429
He's but he's jumping high and but he's not hitting the

451
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,730
He's trying to I don't know what the fuck he's doing

452
01:00:50,289 --> 01:00:53,650
He gets over here and he spins but yoshi's in the water. He's not dead

453
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:58,320
Oh, this is gonna be bad

454
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
Movies aren't real jeremy

01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,539
Okay. Yes. Oh, okay fine

01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,679
I'm going to do that. I'm going okay. I'm going to play the game

Of 61 shines

463

You can probably jump high when you're away from the sewer probably I don't know that's something

464
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:15,409
It probably takes a little bit of practice

465
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:28,369
So, where do I want to go? I want to I did all the stuff in the hotel

Oh, no

Just stare at it for a minute

481
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:26,670
Look at it. Just stare at it

482
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:34,159
This doesn't work doesn't

483
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,059
No, that's not that would be cool. That'd be great if it worked

484
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,070
Just don't just stare at it

485
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:52,510

486
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:53,710

01:04:53,710 --> 01:05:15,389
Okay. Here we go. Get in there

I don't need the spring. I can just jump. Can't I? Yeah, I can I can make it from here. I can make it from here

492
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,559
I think I can

01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,610
Yeah, I can

494
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,610

667
01:34:59,079 --> 01:35:01,079
What's going to one of those sewer things?

668
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:06,239
Look at all the fruit up there. Is there a sewer on up top?

669
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,720
I don't know. Okay, this one right there

01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:14,369

673
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:26,760
I want to break this though

674
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:43,359
Ooh

675
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:44,840
Let's

676
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
Not go this way

677
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,520
Oh, no, let's go this way

678
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,840

679
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,800
Wait

680
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,840
That's a big launch

681
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:03,760
Can I just walk over here blue bird?

682
01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:27,460
Got one. Hey, I made it final level. Oh, this is the last

683
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:35,079
Okay, corona mountain

684
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:54,920
One up. All right. Now there's a okay. We got a jump

685
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:15,159
Not an issue. Not an issue. All right, keep going. We're going right. We're going right side

686
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:24,739
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We're good

687
01:37:24,979 --> 01:37:54,869
Fill me up what's in here two one ups

688
01:37:55,510 --> 01:38:00,069
All right, get the cannon ready into the boat

689
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:25,640
This way, okay. I mean I was in a boat. I didn't

690
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:28,119
I think the boat was going to just capsize

691
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:32,600
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing

692
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,600
I didn't know what the fuck to do

693
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:54,850
I don't even need to wait

694
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:56,130
Why even wait?

695
01:38:56,130 --> 01:39:10,039
Unnecessary

696
01:39:10,039 --> 01:39:12,039
All right this time don't go so hard

697
01:39:14,579 --> 01:39:17,859
Thankfully, I can do this forever because of the one ups

698
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:29,329
Okay killed. Let's try this again

699
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:32,520
So gently gently row the boat

700
01:39:37,409 --> 01:39:49,250
Is it sinking? Don't crash into anything

701
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:54,340
Oh slow slow turn turn turn

702
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:56,039

703
01:39:56,039 --> 01:39:57,720
Oh, this is gonna be

704
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,489
It's all right. It's up

705
01:39:59,489 --> 01:40:03,329
Okay, you touch anything. It's over if you tell that's what happened the last time. I didn't do it

706
01:40:03,409 --> 01:40:05,729
Okay, I get it if you do it too. I get it

707
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:31,729
If you touch anything, it's over. That was really really stupid of me. I was trying to go too fast

708
01:40:32,369 --> 01:40:35,510
I was just trying to skip this whole section

709
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,989
Not worth doing that. You can do it here and that's about it

710
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:57,430
I just didn't get that

711
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:08,210
mother

712
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:10,930
All wonder over the Wi-Fi Wi-Fi over the Wi-Fi

713
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:15,970
No wonder

714
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,170
Wi-Fi

715
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:27,520
That game is so fun

716
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,359
Holy shit

717
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:31,199
All right. It's not a big deal

718
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:36,390
I made that a big deal for no reason

719
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:47,970
All right. Let's go

720
01:41:47,970 --> 01:41:48,850
so

721
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,409
Let's use my binoculars

722
01:41:51,489 --> 01:41:53,970
Left side or right side i'm gonna it looks like left side

723
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:07,399
I want to turn this fucking thing

724
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:12,840
Well, we're going right side

725
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:29,380
Abandon ship just go look at all these blue coins. There's so many blue coins over here

726
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:32,979
It's attempting to get back in the boat and get the blue coins

727
01:43:33,619 --> 01:43:36,239
Is the boat still there?

728
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:38,239
No, it's long gone

729
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,289
Hover and get them. No, that's too dangerous

730
01:43:44,529 --> 01:43:46,050
All right. So what this

731
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:47,250
Hole right here

732
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:56,420
Do the clouds disappear? Oh, this is gonna be bad

733
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:59,220
This is gonna be very bad

734
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,239
It's actually jump king

735
01:44:14,199 --> 01:44:18,659

01:44:18,659 --> 01:44:22,479
Okay, not bad

737
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:24,479
Don't fall down into the bog

738
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:31,010
Where are those we're okay, they're going across and down and left and right

739
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:34,239
It shouldn't be too bad

740
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:36,739
We gotta hit this here

741
01:44:36,739 --> 01:44:38,659

742
01:44:38,659 --> 01:44:40,819
Nope, we're going over here

743
01:44:44,289 --> 01:44:46,289
You can go through them. So that's good

744
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,640
All right, we're just gonna go straight up

745
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:57,970

Oh, man, the the sky is falling the sky is falling

Oh my oh my haven't seen anyone look that good in my in my gear and ages come see me again when you want to return them

839
01:59:00,609 --> 01:59:04,069
It just made this game ugly

840
01:59:04,069 --> 01:59:06,260
It just dropped my brightness and contrast

841
01:59:29,409 --> 01:59:30,609
Hmm

842
01:59:30,609 --> 01:59:57,220
I can't make that jump

843
01:59:57,220 --> 02:00:10,840
You missed the bus. I'm not trying to get on the bus. I'm trying to skip the first bus entirely missed a wink

844
02:00:11,159 --> 02:00:25,109
Did it just throw? No, okay

845
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:32,069
Okay, that's the one right there, right? This is the one that's the one this is the one right here

846
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:35,619
I didn't get on the roof. I didn't get around do it again. Do it again, right do it again

847
02:00:35,699 --> 02:00:37,939
I didn't get on the roof. Yeah, I can't get on the road. I do it again

848
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:49,619
Why why are you spending your winks? Oh because they're gonna be useless in one one day. Yeah, you're right

849
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:55,680
I think you guys would want to hold on to them too, but they're gonna be gone. Yeah, they disappear in one day

850
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:58,550
I guess that's right. That's true

851
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:00,069
I would probably do it too

852
02:01:00,069 --> 02:01:04,069
And again, you could probably do it two or three times for your money on sunday

853
02:01:04,789 --> 02:01:14,449
I thought you just called me wink you stalker. I was like, why am I a stalker?

854
02:01:15,569 --> 02:01:34,979
All right, here we go. Gotta get on the roof on the roof. That's not even right. It's coming over here

855
02:01:35,619 --> 02:01:40,439
Where is it?

856
02:01:40,439 --> 02:01:43,399
On the roof get on the roof get on the roof

857
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:47,829
Get on the roof on roof get on the roof

858
02:01:49,810 --> 02:02:15,010
Land on the roof. How can I do any more like mario vacation games? This is the most winks I think in one day

859
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:29,569
One more day of this and then we're done forever

860
02:02:32,579 --> 02:02:43,539
Here we go on roof. Okay, we're good

861
02:02:44,260 --> 02:02:56,319
Now just don't fall off get right in the middle. Now. I have a question. Do I have to actually get yes I do

862
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,960
That's a dumb question

863
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:01,920
And then on the second boat i'm gonna get in the boat not on the roof

864
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:10,260
Um when I change boats up here after I get up to the banana

865
02:03:10,899 --> 02:03:12,819
Do not get on the roof

866
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:17,439
You know what I mean?

867
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:21,109
What I mean, this is the wrong boat

868
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:25,399
How could this be the wrong boat? Don't get on the roof

869
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,000
Stop texting me

870
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,390
Isn't that the problem?

871
02:03:42,390 --> 02:03:46,949
How could this even be the wrong boat? What are you talking about? This is it's going the exact way I want it to go

872
02:03:47,829 --> 02:03:58,550
Just get on here and then we get on the other boat and just be cautious

873
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:01,029
Be ready

874
02:04:01,029 --> 02:04:03,109
Not yet

875
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:11,039
Okay, just get on this other boat

876
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:21,029
Now I want to confirm

877
02:04:21,029 --> 02:04:23,029
Jump not on the roof

878
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,600
In the boat or should I just try to get on it and just don't and try to stay on it?

879
02:04:27,729 --> 02:04:31,010
Just does the roof. Okay, doesn't matter. Okay, i'm going for it

880
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:37,829

02:04:58,100 --> 02:05:05,140
Oh my god. Oh my god

882
02:05:05,220 --> 02:05:07,220
It's too fucking far

883
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,079
How

884
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:19,920
It's just like I just did a little jump and he just went way over it

885
02:05:24,949 --> 02:05:26,310
Ah

886
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:34,840
I'm just gonna walk off. Oh, okay. I'm doing it again. I'm walking off the edge next time

887
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:37,319
I'm just walking off the edge

888
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:40,800
I'm not jumping. I'm walking off the edge

889
02:05:46,529 --> 02:05:48,529
This sucks such an ass

890
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:53,890
What do you want for a treat? Yoshi?

891
02:05:54,130 --> 02:06:07,319
A pineapple. I haven't even reached the level yet. I know like what the fuck

892
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,960
I'm i'm gonna just fucking

893
02:06:12,119 --> 02:06:14,119
Just slowly fall off the edge

894
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:37,640
Get over here

895
02:06:38,520 --> 02:07:00,600
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. That's it. That's the boat

896
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:04,550
I don't even need the juice. Excuse me game

897
02:07:05,189 --> 02:07:07,189
Find me find me

898
02:07:07,590 --> 02:07:10,470
And what happened there you could hold your breath underwater now

899
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:13,989
Don't get upset by that

900
02:07:13,989 --> 02:07:25,189
Calm down. It's all right

901
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:30,390
No, it's not a big deal. I'm don't be very upset by that. Yoshi's been pretending this whole time

902
02:07:33,989 --> 02:07:40,550
He's not dying guys, he's just disconnecting he's ripping his fucking wi-fi cable out. It's there's a difference

903
02:07:53,279 --> 02:08:08,420
Damn it, man. Get over there. I hope you make it but miss the last jumps. Don't say that

904
02:08:09,319 --> 02:08:11,859
It's such a small jump

905
02:08:11,859 --> 02:08:14,180
It's so small. It's just like a little

906
02:08:15,649 --> 02:08:19,649
I'm trying i'm jumping a little too much and i'm just overshooting the fuck out of it. Let's take a look

907
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:23,970
Crosses over it's just like a little a little

908
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:32,840
You didn't have to like

909
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:35,479
This is the wrong boat. Fuck. It's the wrong boat

910
02:08:37,649 --> 02:08:38,770
wrong boat

911
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:42,760
I mean everyone's saying that it has to be real if it's the wrong boat

912
02:08:44,050 --> 02:08:46,609
It's just a little hop just a little pop

913
02:08:48,739 --> 02:08:50,899
Just a little pop that's it

914
02:09:05,300 --> 02:09:12,550
Okay, just a little pop from here. Just a little like pop just pop just a little pop

915
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:41,510
Toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat toy boat got it. It's just a little like pop

916
02:09:41,989 --> 02:09:45,750
Just pop just a little a tiny one. Just a little just hop

917
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:49,039
On the top. Okay, here comes just a little pop

918
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:53,119

It's just a little pop here comes pop

920
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:59,010
Just a little pop

921
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:11,380
Pop game over don't say that yet. This is gonna throw me around

922
02:10:13,350 --> 02:10:15,829
I'm i'm so paranoid that I gotta get up like a little

923
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,899
There's a little pop

924
02:10:18,899 --> 02:10:20,340
No, I already did that

925
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,470
But I don't know what to jump off

926
02:10:22,470 --> 02:10:24,470
What what's the correct time to jump off?

927
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:29,359
And I have a better idea

928
02:10:29,699 --> 02:10:35,539
Why not just put some of yoshi's spit in a bottle and dump it on there when I just take the fucking fairy

929
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:39,779
Why do we have to do all this? I just can you just spit in a bottle for me and I can dump it on there

930
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:45,680
Okay, when do I go off?

931
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:47,680
Not now. This is too far

932
02:10:48,210 --> 02:10:50,529
Not now not yet. Not yet

933
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:54,449
Not yet. Not yet. Not yet now

934
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:56,800
I did it

935
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:03,119
Thank god

936
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:04,960
Holy shit. Here we go

937
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:18,579
This is I've never seen this. How do I take the sunglasses off? Is it food here? There's no food here

938
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:33,569
Whatever. Let's go

939
02:11:33,569 --> 02:11:34,689
What?

940
02:11:34,689 --> 02:11:36,930
Wait, it's just a water slide

941
02:11:37,729 --> 02:11:56,279
I have six

942
02:11:56,279 --> 02:11:58,279
This is gonna be fun

943
02:11:58,279 --> 02:12:04,050
Wait back back back back it back. No, no, no back back back back back it up back it up back it up back it up

944
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:06,050
Back it up back it up back it up back it up back it up

945
02:12:06,609 --> 02:12:22,680
There's a current I can salvage it. I can salvage this just

946
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,760
It bumped into the fucking wall

947
02:12:28,609 --> 02:12:32,210
It bumped it like it did this like extreme spin

948
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:41,810
Digimon no, what's the that's the spinning tops the spinning top to our cartoon with tops spinning to each other and fucking break

949
02:12:42,369 --> 02:12:43,729
What is it called?

950
02:12:43,729 --> 02:12:46,210
Did what's what's it called beyblade?

951
02:12:46,850 --> 02:13:05,989
This is extreme

952
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:08,949
Grab the edge grab the edge

953
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:14,630
Okay, all I care. Okay, I can just I think like some delight and I think I still do this. Does it respawn?

954
02:13:16,789 --> 02:13:18,069
It's gonna respawn

955
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:24,149
It's the lily pad comes back

956
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:37,109
I it definitely does

957
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:38,529
Is it there?

958
02:13:38,529 --> 02:13:44,880
There's some there's a pipe at the end of the level

959
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:54,310
Oh, I think I can get that coin

960
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:58,319
I think I can get that coin

961
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:11,760
I think I can get that coin

962
02:14:13,859 --> 02:14:19,859
I can get that but I can retry. There's no reason to do that

963
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:24,100
What uh, just get the one off at least there's no reason to do what i'm doing right now

964
02:14:24,819 --> 02:14:27,779
If I if I can retry it by going in the pipe then just do it

965
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:43,729
Go in the pipe what i'm going

966
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:54,279
Stop don't pipe is don't stop don't go in the pipe. No, what don't don't one guy one guy

967
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,760
What do you mean one guy?

968
02:14:56,760 --> 02:15:00,079
Cat is lying about the pipe

969
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:03,939
That's a trap

970
02:15:03,939 --> 02:15:08,100
I'm going in it. I'm fucking whatever. Okay, I i'm gonna ride it the whole time

971
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:13,699
I was looking at the chat room and I pressed the wrong tilt. I tilted a little bit extra looking at the fucking chat

972
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:17,699
And I come back and it's a little bit too far. All right, i'm just gonna go in the pipe

973
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,520
Just get me in the pipe

974
02:16:55,170 --> 02:16:57,889
Wave of people that said go in the pipe

975
02:16:58,530 --> 02:17:03,010
Brings you to the start

976
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:05,010
And then a show of people said don't

977
02:17:05,409 --> 02:17:10,610
So I thought those people were just trying to be like stomp like pepe left. Don't fucking tell him to do that

978
02:17:12,579 --> 02:17:14,760
Oh my god

979
02:17:15,479 --> 02:17:17,799
But there were green pipes at the beginning of the level

980
02:17:18,639 --> 02:17:24,639
There were there was like three green pipes that were right at the beginning and I believe the first 500 people

981
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:31,120
dude

982
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:33,680
I got actually

983
02:17:33,739 --> 02:17:36,239
Extreme one guide did I

984
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:41,440
No, I didn't did I did that happen? Is that the only one I've read?

985
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:45,360
It can't be no it was more than that. It was like a thousand people

986
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:47,920
It was like a thousand people

987
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:54,559
Uh, no, it was at least at least a few hundred

988
02:17:55,940 --> 02:17:58,500
It was no it wasn't one person. It can't be

989
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:07,940
Everyone was saying don't do it

990
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:09,780
Yeah

991
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:16,200
It's like the boy who cried wolf with this chat man. I'm telling you

992
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:21,110
Some people say shit. That's just fucking inaccurate

993
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:25,569
And then I go no, no, no, they're fucking with me and there's a wolf eating us

994
02:18:25,969 --> 02:18:30,209
We're all being eaten. The the the chickens are all gone. The house is getting knocked. There's a

995
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:33,250
There's a the wolf is here

996
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:40,209
And now I have to do that all over again

997
02:18:40,530 --> 02:18:42,530
To go back there. I'm not doing that again

998
02:18:43,409 --> 02:18:52,200
Why the one guy the no the the 201 guys that were responsible for what just happened are sitting there just like

999
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:56,360
Fucking they're just rubbing their fucking hands right now. They're like, oh

1000
02:18:57,959 --> 02:18:59,920
We got him

1001
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:00,879

Going I can't I I'm seriously

1009
02:20:06,659 --> 02:20:08,659
Year of the bait

1010
02:20:08,819 --> 02:20:11,379
What did I do? Did I not do the eighth one here? Let me see. It's in here

1011
02:20:12,100 --> 02:20:14,180
Is that okay? Is there anything cool I can do?

1012
02:20:14,979 --> 02:20:20,500
Besides the regular levels. Well, is there something else cool to check out before I stop my rest on time?

1013
02:20:21,299 --> 02:20:28,760
There's another this other secret another secret level. Oh the ground pound mini game. Yeah, I want to do that. Where is it?

02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:48,739
I haven't been back there all game. I don't even know where it is

1017
02:20:49,459 --> 02:21:19,680

I'm just pretending to know what you're saying. What oh that's okay

1025
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:09,940
Spray the beach

1026
02:22:09,940 --> 02:22:29,600
Okay, that's not I mean, that's kind of cool. I guess

1027
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:34,290
There's more of these

1028
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:55,399
Okay, cool. Okay, dude. I just found uh, I just found that star. That's like a secret star. Can we get a hype train?

1029
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:59,860
I just found something that like everybody finds in when they play a game

1030
02:23:00,659 --> 02:23:03,430
Uh, let's start a hype

1031
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:04,389
cool

1032
02:23:04,389 --> 02:23:20,579
scams scams

1033
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:33,889
Local streamer runs scam on his audience and it's just me

1034
02:23:34,530 --> 02:23:37,329
It's just it's just like the

1035
02:23:37,729 --> 02:23:39,649
I'm completely silhouette it out

1036
02:23:39,649 --> 02:24:13,879
Just like this

1037
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:16,450
so why

1038
02:24:16,450 --> 02:24:20,850
Why why did you do that? Why did you continue to try to bait people into giving you money?

1039
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:24,020
well, you know, it's

1040
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:25,700
honestly, it just uh

1041
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:27,860
It seemed like the easiest way to just make money

1042
02:24:28,739 --> 02:24:29,620
I

1043
02:24:29,620 --> 02:24:33,010
Know if I said hey, yo, we're doing a hype train of this get hype

1044
02:24:33,569 --> 02:24:37,569
People who did that for hundreds of dollars would just come in so I just figured why not

1045
02:24:39,959 --> 02:24:41,959
What did you spend that money on?

1046
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:46,000
Uh drugs a lot of it, uh, mostly drugs

1047
02:24:46,979 --> 02:24:51,059
I'd say 92 of all the money that came in went into drugs. I just did drugs all day

1048
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:55,139
and then maybe five percent to mcdonald's and

1049
02:24:56,500 --> 02:25:02,979
Seven or eight percent to bills. I guess I paid some bills. I lost a lot of it too. Actually I got out of the bed and

1050
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:05,860
Just kind of didn't know where it went

1051
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,180
At least five to ten twenty percent of it

1052
02:25:09,059 --> 02:25:12,930
Okay, that that comes out to uh to to a hundred and twenty eight percent

1053
02:25:14,450 --> 02:25:16,850
Yeah, let's uh

1054
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:18,850
Yeah, I would say that's accurate

1055
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:27,139
and I mean

1056
02:25:27,139 --> 02:25:29,540
It's not like I uh, but you got you're not like showing my face, right?

1057
02:25:33,479 --> 02:25:49,700
I whoops. I fucked it up

1058
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:51,700
There's the crack head

1059
02:26:07,969 --> 02:26:09,809
Why am I biting my lip?

1060
02:26:09,809 --> 02:26:12,610
Because I always bite my lip. I'm a constant lip biter

1061
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,360
And I put like vaseline on it to prevent myself from doing it

1062
02:26:25,989 --> 02:26:32,200
What the hell is this? This is not the airstrip. This is not the airstrip

1063
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:11,090
Um, let's try again, what even is this a picture of

1064
02:27:42,069 --> 02:27:50,950
This is not the airstrip though. It's a surf map. It kind of was a surf map

1065
02:27:54,370 --> 02:28:02,319
behind you

1066
02:28:02,319 --> 02:28:14,930
Talk to the guy behind yoshi

1067
02:28:14,930 --> 02:28:17,409
This guy behind yoshi, this is behind yoshi

1068
02:28:19,879 --> 02:28:22,440
Shall I take you out to the airstrip? It's only ten coins

1069
02:28:23,159 --> 02:28:41,040
We'll get ten coins

1070
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:58,799
Something something and a aim. I know whatever nine really nine

1071
02:29:00,709 --> 02:29:30,899
Nine points because you can't put ten there. Remember reacts to only finding nine coins

1072
02:29:31,459 --> 02:29:34,209
That would be a slow youtube day

1073
02:29:34,209 --> 02:29:39,569
That would be like I have extra footage that I haven't had a video go up in like two or three weeks

1074
02:29:39,889 --> 02:29:41,889
And i'm just like fuck. Um

1075
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:48,340
Uh auto's dog farts messing up my game

1076
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,159
All right

1077
02:29:50,159 --> 02:30:00,450
What's this was it been like six days since the video went up shit? Okay, how about like a yeah, that's that sounds good

1078
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:04,420
real video by the way

1079
02:30:04,420 --> 02:30:07,620
If some of you new reviewers real video this is real

1080
02:30:08,260 --> 02:30:24,680
All right back in the airstrip now what it's it's been the whole game since i've been here

1081
02:30:30,899 --> 02:30:35,540
Oh, no, should I come here with the nozzle the nozzle's here

1082
02:30:37,510 --> 02:30:42,280
Oh, thank goodness

You can melt them. Where do I get I can get fire. Oh, you just know you just melt them

1087
02:31:19,889 --> 02:31:21,879
Dark matter

1088
02:31:21,879 --> 02:31:23,879
All right, let's do uh, i'm assuming these are coins

1089
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:27,559
You might my dog my dog just farted

1090
02:31:29,590 --> 02:31:31,750
Stop we don't watch videos from 10 years ago

1091
02:31:32,389 --> 02:32:16,420
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on

1092
02:32:40,319 --> 02:33:04,879

1093
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,239

1094
02:33:09,459 --> 02:33:17,600
No, whatever anything ground pound minigame ground pound sound delay again, why does it keep happening with this game?

1095
02:33:18,399 --> 02:33:20,440
Where's the ground palm minigame?

1096
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:41,760
It's in a building. I already got this one

1097
02:33:44,680 --> 02:33:46,920
house to the left of the big shine thing

1098
02:33:47,959 --> 02:33:53,479
It's very ella. I like your description. That's I very easy for me to understand

1099
02:33:55,909 --> 02:34:00,069
This thing probably has a name

1100
02:34:00,149 --> 02:34:00,950
like

1101
02:34:00,950 --> 02:34:05,750
Shiny mount stadium or something but like a big shine star thing. I know what that is

1102
02:34:06,229 --> 02:34:15,280
Now it's building over there. Okay, actually I might have the wrong thing for this

1103
02:34:43,440 --> 02:34:54,719
Oh wait, can I go through this? I hear one. Why do I hear one? Okay

1104
02:34:55,909 --> 02:35:00,979
Uh building here it is

1105
02:35:00,979 --> 02:35:04,819
Break all the crates within 30 seconds to win a prize. You want to try? Yeah, sure

1106
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:36,159
That was great. You're the best three misses and I died. It's fine

1107
02:35:38,600 --> 02:35:40,600
69 shines

1108
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,319
We did it. Yeah, we did it. Hooray

1109
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:55,379
Ha ha ha ha

1110
02:35:55,379 --> 02:35:58,340
This crap everybody laughed really hard

1111
02:35:59,139 --> 02:36:01,829
Come on, let me make it even funnier

1112
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,680
Why did I spend any of these blue coins?

1113
02:36:21,159 --> 02:36:27,239
I mean too bad. It wasn't

1114
02:36:27,459 --> 02:36:29,459
69 three times

1115
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:32,520
Right. That would have been pretty funny

1116
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:39,989
Actually, that kind of would have been pretty funny considering it would have taken me so much longer to beat the game

1117
02:36:40,309 --> 02:36:46,950
Because at least seven or eight of these stars or ten of them are blue coin stars. I hear this thing

1118
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:49,459
Where is it?

1119
02:36:49,459 --> 02:37:27,719
Can I not how do I get in here? All right this guy?

1120
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:33,379
This guy's a chuckster

1121
02:37:33,379 --> 02:38:14,239
Oh, howdy throw me a coin. I'll throw you for a loop. Ah, anyway, here you go. Okay

1122
02:38:15,620 --> 02:38:17,299
We are gonna

1123
02:38:17,299 --> 02:38:19,299
Take a quick little break. I'm gonna go pee

1124
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:21,139
We're gonna change

1125
02:38:21,139 --> 02:38:23,139
To something what do I what do I want to do?

1126
02:38:25,059 --> 02:38:27,780
The we the game cube shit's already hooked up and it's already set

1127
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:31,620
So I might just maybe play a Wii game or something play another game cube game

1128
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:36,979
Because it would be i'd have to switch out a bunch of cables

1129
02:38:37,540 --> 02:38:46,370
And recalibrate some stuff to change anything else. Uh, let me take a look. See what I got. I'll be right back
