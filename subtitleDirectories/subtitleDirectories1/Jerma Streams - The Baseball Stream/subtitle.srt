1
00:03:55,349 --> 00:05:02,019
Welcome to Car Shield Field where we have German Baseball Association action for you

2
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,540
tonight. A big time matchup between the California Circus and the Maryland

3
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,779
Magicians. Maryland comes in at 27 and 22 the circus 11 games over 500. I'm joined

4
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:20,819
by former Phoenix caveman great Gary Grunt. I am Storm Williamson and Gary we

5
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,660
should have a big time great matchup on the field tonight. Yeah very good ball

6
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,060
clubs on the field here this evening Storm. We throw out the record books when

7
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,899
these two teams get together. They're just two vastly different ball clubs.

8
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:37,540
They win different ways. The circus is more of a clown show. They kind of try to

9
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,899
trick you into some different pitches whereas on the other side the Magicians

10
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,500
they win with their clever illusions. I'd like to see what the big tall

11
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,899
right-hander has on the mound here tonight. What kind of tricks they have up

12
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:51,620
their sleeve and of course the power cards will play a big part of tonight's

13
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,500
game. Get a look at Joy Hansome right now the manager of the Maryland Magicians.

14
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,220
He's guided his club to a five game over 500 mark so far this year and a coastal

15
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,660
clash these teams coming from across the country to meet tonight. There you get a

16
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,860
look at Fred Big Top the leader of the California Circus and don't let that

17
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,660
face fool you he has been plenty happy this year. We talked about that record of

18
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,980
30 and 19 for them on the year and we go from Big Top to Big Boy on the mound. Big

19
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,699
Boy Buckle gets the call for the circus. He has been outstanding all year long to

20
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,980
the tune of a 9 and 6 record 2.81 ERA. What are the Magicians going to have to

21
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,540
do to try to put a dent in what this man has done this year? Well for the the man

22
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,819
on the mound here tonight he's obviously a very dominant right-hander. Look for

23
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,939
the off-speed pitches to be really key to his arsenal tonight and on the other

24
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:51,660
side for the Magicians they just need to make contact. There's a lot of movement from

25
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,100
from Big Boy and we'll see what kind of contact they can make here tonight. So

26
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,019
Donald Strange will come to the plate the first batter for the Maryland

27
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:08,339
Magicians and the first pitch of our game just a little bit high and already

28
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,660
Chief Albertson having a word with our pitcher we've only gotten one pitch

29
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,139
through the game. Yeah he's gonna have to take care of that control problem he

30
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,259
needs to get that lower and over the plate or else the Magicians players

31
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,459
are gonna be in for a long night dipping and diving and trying to get out of the

32
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:27,750
way that some of these pitches. Crew chief Albertson you get a look at him

33
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,670
right there chief of the one-man crew tonight so doing a great job and maybe

34
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,350
not so great of a job on that call. Yeah questionable call there but Albertson

35
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,750
he's the crew chief tonight so what he says go what he says go and that ball

36
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,029
was maybe a little inside the plate. 258 hitting Donald Strange took a big rip at

37
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:53,430
that one couldn't quite connect and the count to one ball and two strikes now.

38
00:07:53,430 --> 00:08:04,660
A big cut there from Strange playing for the Magicians third baseman tonight

39
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:11,199
playing the hot corner. Xavier McMagic awaits on deck here comes the next pitch

40
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,709
from Big Boy. Big Rock a couple of them make it three is the third a charm a hot

41
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,189
shot towards the hole at second base what a play and they rob him of a hit

42
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:29,110
outstanding from Paul Laffington no laughing matter on the middle infield.

43
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,990
Absolutely no laughing matter got over to his left got to the ball and then

44
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,309
great release from glove to arm to make that throw first out of the inning great

45
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,870
play going to his left. And Donald Strange had to be thinking look I've done my job

46
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,750
we've got a base hit to lead off this game uh-uh the circus who had some

47
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,470
trouble getting to this game tonight having no trouble getting settled in.

48
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,990
Yeah they had a lot of trouble apparently they put the wrong gas in the

49
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,029
car it was uh someone had put petroleum gas and they're looking for laughing gas.

50
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:05,049
Hold on hold on crew chief Albertson is down. Oh no we've seen some issues with

51
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:12,379
Albertson. And this is you know again we need to mention here a crew chief of one

52
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,419
so he's saying he's all right but but we'll have to see how he goes about this

53
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:20,419
moving on that could be a lingering injury. Yeah Albertson the only umpire

54
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:24,019
here tonight has to cover home plate first base second base third base the

55
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:29,019
outfield as well. Laffington charging in and he bubbles flips to the back

56
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:35,700
Albertson calls him out. Great play again there from the second baseman for the

57
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,980
circus. Seen some errant wands flying here and there and Albertson yells safe

58
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,179
into the dugout with the out signal and now all of a sudden coming out of the

59
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:53,929
dugout Joy Handsome has got some words. Yeah might have to go into the magic

60
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:58,450
spellbook here to figure out how to break this defense and get past the

61
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:05,889
adversity that the umpire and crew chief has created here so far. Joy back to the

62
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:11,850
bench and now we get our first look at Zeke Flash a couple of bounces in and

63
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,009
Albertson thinking about it but he will rule it ball one. That's what happens

64
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,809
here in the JBA sometimes a little cricket can bounce out you just never

65
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,190
know what's gonna happen. I want to thank all of you for tuning into the

66
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,610
Germa Baseball Association ripping a hot shot just foul past the third base bag

67
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,610
count to one and one now on Zeke Flash the shortstop for the Maryland

68
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:39,289
Magicians is hitting 246 on the year with a slugging percentage of 365.

69
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,850
Flash very capable of putting the ball over the seats we'll see what

70
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,429
kind of pitch he gets here. It's an interesting one from Buckle and kicking

71
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:54,110
his heel out it. Couldn't get a piece of it trying to get a board first base

72
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,429
with the hit by pitch but he can't come up with it. We don't expect

73
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,070
runs to be at a premium but if you can get on base any way you can stick a leg

74
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,710
foot anything wand anything you can get a baseball on. And we get a pop fly into

75
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,269
shallow right field moving towards right center the play is made by Lenny Munson

76
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,629
so one two three big boy Buckle great work in the top half of the first he

77
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,190
gets them in order the California Circus will come to the plate when we return

78
00:11:23,190 --> 00:12:44,259
you're watching Germa Baseball Association. Welcome back to Car Shield

79
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:49,179
Field this is the Germa Baseball Association Maryland Magicians and the

80
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:54,980
California Circus through one half inning of play a one two three top half

81
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,779
of the first for big boy Buckle on the mound and now he gives way to Doug Dubb

82
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,779
the right-handed pitcher for the Maryland Magicians stands at five foot

83
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,700
nine a hundred sixty pounds we talked about that great record for big boy how

84
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,580
about an eight and three record for Doug Dubb. Yeah Doug Dubb known for pulling it

85
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,340
out the Dubb out of the hat can really fired in there with a fastball has a

86
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,500
good change up mixes in his pitches very nicely can also throw a four seam sinker

87
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,940
that sinks away from left-handed hitters and as well as cut into righties so

88
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,419
we'll see how Mr. Dubb handles his top half of the inning we saw relatively easy

89
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,620
inning for big boy in the first the top half of the first inning here we'll see

90
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,940
how Doug Dubb does here as you see his stats on the board 18 games pitched eight

91
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,259
and three record look at that strikeout to walk ratio as we mentioned the stuff

92
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,860
and the kind of creativity he has on the mound he can really smoke it by the

93
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,820
batter. And so now Hunter Sweets the leadoff man for the California Circus

94
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,179
he'll be followed by Percy Polkadot and then David Honk batting in the three

95
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:04,620
spot for the California Circus and Hunter Sweet has brought quite a bit of

96
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,019
power to the table on the season while only hitting 216 a 341 slug due to five

97
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,659
home runs and you saw crew chief Albertson taking a good look at that bat

98
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:18,419
prior maybe just to make sure hey is this thing corked what's going on here

99
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:23,019
yeah I can't have any illegal play here can't have a cork bat that wouldn't be

100
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:27,059
good it wouldn't level the playing field here tonight as Dubb fires it in there

101
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:33,000
as Doug has really been one of the top magicians in the JBA in terms of

102
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,460
pitching he really focuses on his craft. The Hocus Pocus on point two and one

103
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:45,990
with that swing and a miss get a look there at crew chief Albertson as Dubb

104
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,490
peers in for the next. Changing the wind up here trying to keep the hitter off

105
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,610
balance and does. Oh my goodness you talked about that heat hello. You can see

106
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,009
the two different styles of the pitchers we saw big boy a little bit

107
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:06,840
more crafty. Dubb here in the bottom half of the first just throwing gas. The Cape

108
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:14,120
Crusader hits him with the breaking ball and Sweets is down. Oh he's thinking

109
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,360
about it there goes the bat Dubb kicks it right back towards him and hitting in

110
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,039
between them Roy Flushman says hey fellas let's simmer it now we're only in

111
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,840
the first. Yeah don't let anything let cooler heads prevail here as Albertson

112
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
gives him the bases we'll get a replay on this you see the curveball just got

113
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:38,519
away from him it's him it's the batter in the left shoulder goes down. A great

114
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,759
time to point out that safety and security really important aspects in

115
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,279
every part of your life we have to deal with them on a daily basis and it can be

116
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,600
hard to find the right solutions wouldn't it be great if there was one

117
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,879
solution that gets rid of those problems most internet users aren't sure of the

118
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:58,200
amount of surveillance limitation and data mining done with their personal

119
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,720
information but surf shark can solve all of those problems for you that's surf

120
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,759
shark go ahead and check them out and make sure that your data is safe.

121
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,039
Polkadot taking a strike to begin this at bat runner over at first base is

122
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,320
Hunter Sweets after being hit by the pitch they check on him and he slides

123
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,860
back in safe. A great curveball thrown by Dubb there just went 12 to 6 no chance

124
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,139
for the hitter. So we saw the magicians go down in order first base runner of

125
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:32,460
this game Sweets over at first base a bit outside but did appear that her

126
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,779
chief Albertson called that a strike it's to Owen too and Polkadot wants to

127
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,740
have an extra look back at Albertson as he yells towards the dugout of the

128
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,779
magicians. You got to keep the runner on as well so a lot dealing dealing with a lot

129
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:50,779
here this one's hit high and deep left side but that'll get foul. That ball was blasted.

130
00:16:50,779 --> 00:17:05,019
Polkadot yes. Percy not playing get a look at that big red nose of his and he

131
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:10,339
was going to really really be happy if he could send that one over the fence a

132
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:16,640
good start here though for the California circus. Dubb turns and throws

133
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,319
the first base Sweets back in time again really keeping tabs on him. Yeah

134
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,200
absolutely don't want to give up a stalled base here still early on in the

135
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,109
game so runs out of premium and can't give up can't give them away here. Dubb's

136
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:34,549
pitch a breaking ball that is fouled away to the right side that will reach

137
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:40,480
the seats. Notice the equipment change from the Klanza I'm used to seeing them

138
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,799
and games pass for they've got you know bigger shoes on comically large shoes

139
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,000
they got normal shoes on here tonight so it could be another tactic implemented

140
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,160
by the managing staff to get some more wins for this California circus. And what

141
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,680
a job out of the circus dugout there you see great job running out those balls

142
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,079
to crew chief Albertson doing a great job himself behind home plate despite a

143
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,640
couple of controversial calls and that might be another one called out on

144
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,119
strikes. Polkadot the first out of the bottom of the first inning. Well Albertson's

145
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:15,359
been consistent with the zone so far he's calling him high he's calling him low

146
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,240
calling him outside and inside so consistency is the name of the game when

147
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,359
near the umpire and look at this one catches the outside corner. Great frame

148
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,400
job by the catcher. That's a great point that you make there I want to go back to

149
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,799
that though Gary a former great in this game how much does that consistency from

150
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,799
the umpire matter you know you know that any given pitch is going to be a strike

151
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,359
whether it is or not and that helps you out a lot as a batter. Yeah it keeps you

152
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:46,160
on your toes it really focuses you in on the the spin rate of the ball and you

153
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,579
really want to try to make contact as we have a stolen base attempt here. Hunter Sweets is out!

154
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:56,579
Albertson he took some time with it I thought he might pull out the safe call

155
00:18:56,579 --> 00:19:02,259
but he does rule him out a stolen base caught stealing I should say on the

156
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:06,619
steal attempt from Hunter Sweets. Yeah not a great jump and a fantastic throw

157
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:12,269
down right into the glove of the second baseman there and the tag is applied and

158
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:19,619
the second out of the bottom of the half of the first inning here great throw.

159
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,099
Just like that two down Albertson having to keep both of these dugouts in check

160
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:29,740
early on a lot of jawing going on from both sides. Well the stakes are high here

161
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,690
Storm these teams need a victory. They need a victory and you know we're

162
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,529
talking about two of the best teams in this league as well we're getting closer

163
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:43,690
to postseason play and you want to be in the correct form when you go into

164
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,049
postseason play and we'll see if these teams can get back to the style of

165
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,210
baseball that we're used to seeing. Yeah jockeying for playoff positioning as

166
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,569
this one's in there for they call that a strike. Three one is the count. Yeah

167
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:01,369
games playing elsewhere the drunkards are playing the Mimes this evening as

168
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:05,170
well as the K-Band my former squad and the old ladies matched it up we'll have

169
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,769
crunch time after this to give us the full breakdown on all the highlights of

170
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:14,650
the JPA games that are happening this afternoon. And it goes into foul

171
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:21,369
territory. Should mention here you know we've got our standard defensive

172
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:25,690
alignment for the most part and a man on stilts out in left center for the

173
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,170
magicians you know that is your weapon one of those tricks that you can pull

174
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,009
out when you need it time and time again and against these right-handed batters

175
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:37,410
power hitters trying to put a gapper out there and score a run not today. Yeah

176
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:42,569
it's the JBA's version of almost of a defensive shift where they hit the man

177
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:47,369
and stilts out in left field again he can get those wall scrapers anything

178
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:51,890
going over that wall on that left side he can get to and track down. And what is

179
00:20:51,890 --> 00:21:00,190
this? They called it a strike in David Honk. He got the umpire got the

180
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:08,190
count wrong. And you know that's one of those things oh strike call and that

181
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:14,349
will set down David Honk and do it for this first inning so we did get our

182
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:17,990
first baserunner of the game but a pair of strikeouts in the caught stealing

183
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,349
they go in order once again do the California Circus back with more JBA

184
00:21:23,349 --> 00:23:18,039
action after this. And we are back at car shield field this is the germa baseball

185
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:24,039
association I am Storm Williamson joined by former caveman great Gary grunt soon

186
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:28,819
to be Hall of Famer next year they're gonna have that induction for you we got

187
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:33,059
some noise coming from the circus dugout Elbertson trying to check this

188
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,940
bat right now from Roy Flushman we saw Flushman get in between what could have

189
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,619
been an altercation in that first inning. Look at that defensive lineup for the circus. Buckle

190
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:48,319
towing the rubber helium on first laughing kid on second. Oh the circus with

191
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,539
some noise from the dugout but it's booted it's short unable to make the

192
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:57,900
play polka dot. Polka dot very upset with the shortstop unable to make that play

193
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,180
just a slow roller to that left side you could argue the play should have been

194
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,779
made as look right toward the shortstop for the circus. And you know we have we

195
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:15,009
have security just beyond the first base bag he was patting down Roy Flushman

196
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,369
right there just to make sure that nothing nefarious was going on have

197
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:22,029
anything illegal on the field there's no chewing gum no no sunflower seeds they

198
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,690
got to make sure we keep this field clean. You never know where these

199
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,329
magicians are going to hide something that might give them the advantage look

200
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:32,730
at him drop the bunt pull it back and put it in the left field that is a

201
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,289
beautiful piece of hitting by Craig mystery keeping it a mystery what he's

202
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,289
gonna do with the play. Yeah Craig doing a very good job showed bunt pulled it

203
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,490
back and roped a single now Elbertson looking at him now he's coming over to

204
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,450
talk to him. Is Elbertson saying something illegal? Not on the field dugout dugout

205
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:03,009
you can't I don't know how it works. Oh no smoking on the field I guess uh he was

206
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:07,369
trying to have a smoke at a pancake which that's not allowed here so great

207
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:13,289
job by Elbertson to keep it clean here. Yeah they're gonna have to have a talk with the

208
00:25:13,289 --> 00:25:21,930
manager for the magicians. Yeah he is not gonna have this. That's a warning.

209
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,059
Joy Hansen you know tobacco products allowed on the field in this game. He's

210
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,980
saying look just a little bit can't can't we just have just a couple of

211
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,500
puffs when we get to first base you know just a little like a first base break I

212
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,339
mean look at this we got some pipe action going on in the other dugout

213
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,539
what's the big deal? There's no puffing the magic dragon or any dragon here in

214
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:46,839
the car shard field car shield field so there'll be no puffing. Slow one comes in

215
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,480
it's fouled back off the bat Ronnie Smith. Now we're gonna have a mascot

216
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,559
battle behind home plate between the clowns excuse me for the circus and the

217
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,400
magicians as you can see the looks like Dumbledore and Dumbledore has stolen a

218
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,680
fan sign and used it as a weapon here that is a lot of action on the field and

219
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,799
in the stands here security has to come over maybe separate the two mascots

220
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,000
behind home plate so the pitcher doesn't get distracted. You see big boy going with

221
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,799
that split grip to start how hard is it for a guy like him to to keep things

222
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,119
under control when there's so much going on with the call strike. A lot of distraction but we

223
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,160
see it all the time in the JPA so these guys are used to it they could stay

224
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,039
locked in stay laser focused on the task at hand and big boys got a chance to

225
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,400
for a double play here. Albertson is rightfully calling out look we have a

226
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,559
team called the circus yet it's the magicians that have been the circus in

227
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,839
the dugout. Yeah absolutely a clown show right now for the magicians creating a

228
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,079
lot of havoc talking a lot of smack directing a lot of their hostilities

229
00:26:54,079 --> 00:27:02,839
towards Albertson. You know they are the circus but this is a team that's won 30

230
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:08,160
games this year and you think about a circus maybe being disorganized this

231
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,279
might be one of the more organized circuses you'll find out there is big

232
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,160
off balance as he comes home with it and that go it's all the way to the

233
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,319
backstop so runners advanced to second and third base in our count goes to two

234
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:27,289
and two so that was a call strike. So big chance for the magicians now to get on

235
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,250
the board two runners in scoring position let's see if they can get this

236
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,980
ball in play no out still here at the top of the second. You know one-man crew

237
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,380
just how clean this home plate is for a one-man crew truly incredible big

238
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,420
boy buckle still waiting for this plate to get wiped off and you know we talked

239
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,140
about some of the distractions now the stoppage in play he looks like he's in

240
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,339
rhythm out there. And he's starting to find his tempo find that rhythm see if he

241
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,579
floats one across play again the two different styles of pitchers is on

242
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,539
display here tonight as you know a big boy just kind of lost it over the plate

243
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:08,460
relies on his on his off-speed stuff doesn't throw anything overpowering has

244
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,420
to hit his spots and he walks the batter here yeah big boys not happy with

245
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,000
that he thought that one bounced up into the zone and Albertson is trying to show

246
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,660
him that big boys still not buying it and now our bases are loaded over there

247
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,539
at first base trying to make sure that the magicians have everything together

248
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:35,339
we have a power card we have a power card being played Albertson there it is

249
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:41,819
what card is being played here let's see it's a common card all opposing

250
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:46,660
outfielders are removed for the next at-bat what a card to play that is the

251
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,180
kind of managing we love to see here in the JBA and you know this is just a

252
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,380
veteran move by joy handsome you see why this team has been so successful all

253
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,980
year long bases loaded jam nobody out how are how are we gonna do this poof

254
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,420
that's how we're gonna do it we're gonna put that poof card out there and see if

255
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,299
they can't even capitalize even more here for the magicians smart time to

256
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:15,019
play this card poof the outfielders are gone and a big chance for the magicians

257
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,059
to get some runs on the board and interesting the Fred Big Top was you

258
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,380
know coming out as if to show that he was not happy with that call that is

259
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,259
well within league rules there's supposed to be a power court has to be

260
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:32,740
played before the batter steps into the batter's box look at first pitch

261
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,220
swinging there's nobody out there all the way to the surf shark sign and they

262
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,380
are not going to be able to do anything about it look at the big man chug here

263
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,470
goes Donovan Slate into third base with the triple all the bases are still

264
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,789
loaded and the bases are still loaded three runs come around to score and two

265
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,950
more runners out on the path they just kept going around the clowns are trying

266
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,109
to settle the show right now and playing that these up now we got a look

267
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:08,900
out run down run down here in the infield it's a mystery as to what's

268
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,740
going on Craig mystery being chased he's single to get a board he later came

269
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:20,539
around to score Albertson trying to gain control of this mess right now and he

270
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:24,980
gets those players off the field so what a triple there from the magicians here's

271
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,859
another look at it lined in the left field smoked nobody out there again the

272
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:37,460
card was played no outfielders for that that the magicians capitalize just like

273
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,940
that our first runs of the ballgame they belong to the Maryland magicians it's a

274
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,470
three nothing score in the top of the second inning still nobody out here for

275
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:54,460
the magicians and the circus now have their outfielders back see how big boy

276
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,339
buckle respond here trying to put a little mustard on the ball like that

277
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:02,180
little slap swag with that last delivery excuse me is we're gonna fly

278
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:07,380
ball into right it's caught tagging and holding at third base that gun of an

279
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,140
arm from Lenny Munson keeps him put Munson doesn't mess around as a great

280
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,460
right arm really flight that ball into home plate so good job keep the runner

281
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,539
at third base and we still stay at three nothing with one out here at the top of

282
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,339
the second I don't know about you Gary but I do not test people named Lenny

283
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:33,720
Munson is one of those don't test them and don't trust them that one comes in

284
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,079
just a touch low from big boy buckle he's been varying his not only his

285
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,720
delivery but the speed of his pitches as well yeah has featured a couple of

286
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,319
different wind-ups here this one's smoked back up the middle that'll score

287
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:49,500
another run for the magicians look at that off the bat of Barry bedazzle he's

288
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,720
got the magicians up for nil gotta wonder if the circus is thinking about

289
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,500
getting someone warmed up at the bullpen now as buckle has struggled here in the

290
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:05,940
first inning and two-thirds Wow what a promising start for big boy buckle and

291
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,200
as the nine hitter Mike salmon comes to the plate he is motioning for his

292
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,569
outfielders hey come in this guy can't hit the ball anywhere yet they're

293
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:22,000
staying out there salmon likes to hit the ball upriver you know I would think

294
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,319
that a downstream approach might be the path of least resistance but this is a

295
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,359
guy that has seeked out adversity his entire career yeah really puts a lot of

296
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,680
power behind the ball can really whip that bat through the strike zone and

297
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:41,980
plant the baseball wherever he wants puts it on the ground to the right side

298
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,900
laughing tin to the bag at second a perfect one hop throw gets the lead

299
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:51,819
runner turn to first base not in time two down now so feelers choice there

300
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,380
couldn't get the double play for the ball over there in the California

301
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,970
circus another replay here is just getting over the top of that and again

302
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,650
crew chief Elbertson having to take charge and really make sure that these

303
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,410
teams understand who's in charge out here yeah let's keep both managers in

304
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:17,849
check is having another conversation with the circus right now that facial

305
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:21,470
expression for Fred big top a little bit more fitting now that we moved into the

306
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:26,789
second inning down for nil take the slow walk back to the top of the dugout and

307
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,349
what's this what's this Elbertson is stopping play there's a drone on the

308
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:36,269
field oh no Albertson doesn't like likes to keep it again within the rules of

309
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:40,269
play and right now we just have a drone hovering over come on field and

310
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,769
Albertson is I think he's afraid that this could affect play maybe the ball

311
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:48,549
could potentially hit the the drone and affect where it lands and as they're

312
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,670
trying to get this drone out of here these are some of the things you have to

313
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,470
appreciate about in Albertson called game there is some chaos in this league

314
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,869
from time to time Albertson keeps things under wraps and now we get big top with

315
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:07,630
a happy Gilmore style Oh Ichiro's it off the belt and it's caught then dropped

316
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,510
in right what's the call what is Albertson saying there's some confusion

317
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,949
on the base pass they're ruling him out three hours three hours he called them

318
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:24,469
out so wow the cricket style delivery from buckle gets the out and the inning

319
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:30,309

331
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:41,710
Giggles takes a ball so Doug Dove back to work for the magicians and what looked

332
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,670
like you know that leadoff baserunner for California in the bottom of the

333
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,710
first inning that they might be the first to crack the scoreboard wouldn't

334
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,989
really expect this four-nothing score as Albertson might get done with this call

335
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:56,429
sometime tonight it was a big-time strike so he had to emphasize the call

336
00:37:56,429 --> 00:38:01,570
man it was a great pitch on the outside corner another one of the reasons why

337
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,849
you tune in to Albertson games maybe just a little bit more than others

338
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,289
throughout this league on the ground back up the middle Giggles gets it past

339
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:13,769
the glove of the diving shortstop in the centerfield a leadoff base it nice job

340
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:18,570
by Giggles to get a take with the pitcher gave him just drove it right back

341
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,980
up the middle you can see great swing here got enough power behind that pass

342
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,860
the diving shortstop and into the centerfield no wand is gonna get that

343
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:35,949
ball Zeke flash gave it a look but even he not fast enough now Manny up Chuck

344
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:44,000
and he's getting the crowd pumped they love it up Chuck trying to create an

345
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,519
uppercut type swing here they circus needs to get back into this game

346
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:58,059
uppercut strike call from Albertson oh and one ten bombs on the year for up

347
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:06,739
Chuck he looks for another runner on first base is Sean Giggles and he puts a

348
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:10,500
charge into this one into deep centerfield turned around on it but the

349
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,460
play made out there good job by Xavier McMagic yeah great footwork out there by

350
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,900
McMagic Sean why he's a center fielder great form was turned around a little

351
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:29,039
bit but that ball was driven into that deep left center and Giggles will remain

352
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:35,480
his first basal still one runner on as a good catch there from McMagic the

353
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,760
center fielder for the magicians and not sure if we're dealing with an injury for

354
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,119
Doug Dove right now but he's been shoving now they're all at the mound for a meeting

355
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:52,360
oh something has come out here this is a little magic potion maybe a little elixir

356
00:39:52,360 --> 00:40:00,519
oh for the team the feel-good juice as if Doug Dove wasn't in enough of a groove

357
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:04,519
already and now look at this the circus getting involved here on the mound yeah

358
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,920
the jesters want to get in on that a magic elixir see a pie out there as well

359
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:17,739
oh Albertson trying to get the pie off the field I've got a feeling somebody is

360
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:23,300
going to get served not with a paper but a pie sooner than later here sir as long

361
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,099
as it's got a little whipped cream on there maybe it's a banana split pie and

362
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,900
cream pie key lime pie either way we'll serve it up slices here tonight

363
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,460
car shield stadium so up Chuck retired for the first out in the inning and here

364
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:48,010
comes Harry helium helium having some words with Albertson wants to make sure

365
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:55,449
the zones right dove after the magic elixir drops in a strike over the inside

366
00:40:55,449 --> 00:41:02,050
corner the clown mascot really trying to encourage the circus to get some runs

367
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:08,099
get some hits and get back to this game trailing for nothing by the second dove

368
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:15,059
looking energized his pitch just a touch tall he went with the heater that time

369
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:31,059
the next to Harry off the end of his bat he'll poke it foul up the right side

370
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:36,900
Harry helium hitting 254 on the season that on base percentage all the way up

371
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,780
at 355 though that gets plenty of air underneath his batted balls has a high

372
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,300
pitched voice as well as he tries to combine all that in to a nice power

373
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:55,219
stroke there's nothing like the hairy helium high when he sends one long we'll

374
00:41:55,219 --> 00:42:02,630
see if you can put a charge into one here with his next one to count and now

375
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,070
all of a sudden some consternation behind home plate I believe hunter

376
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:12,170
sweets is what are they I think you just want to know what count was make sure you

377
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,130
had it right okay so Harry helium to decide what pitch you wanted to put down

378
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:28,099
for dub the throw and now the pitch popped up back behind home plate out of

379
00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:40,010
play off the bat of helium one ball two strikes to helium going with the

380
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:43,130
interesting makeup can't really get some makeup around that beard so going with

381
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:48,969
the quarter face makeup the dark eyes it's a beard that would make a former

382
00:42:48,969 --> 00:42:53,250
caveman proud you know what I was born but was born came out of the mama's

383
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,530
womb with a with a with a beard and that's most cavemen doing and you were

384
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:05,130
telling me before the game little known fact about Phoenix cavemen players there

385
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,889
is a minimum back hair requirement in order to even even get a call to the

386
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:14,929
trial yes you have to have at least a good three inch thick fur on the back

387
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:19,369
especially across the shoulder blades from left to right that will really get

388
00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:22,369
you into the league of cavemen but if you got those patches down on the left

389
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:30,179
right near the backside of the ribs too we'll take you as well not too picky and

390
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:37,780
helium takes it outside so two and two the count now to Harry helium and right

391
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,019
now Doug Dove just having his way with this circus lineup something we're not

392
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:47,860
used to seeing from California no not at all looking for laughing gas matter this

393
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,980
ball is drilled into center field but should be easy work for the magic the

394
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,590
hat off and everything a little flair without number two I got good wood to it

395
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:04,190
unfortunately gets got a little too underneath that ball and a great play by

396
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:10,670
big magic to get to that one and stay scoreless here is the circus in danger

397
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,800
of leaving a runner on base here they need runs there is no doubt this

398
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:23,699
Maryland team knows how to put on a show as it brings in Larry Munson Munson

399
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:29,619
sends a third fly ball into centerfield hat off again Mick magic has done it

400
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:34,860
all three of the outs in this inning awfully impressive we'll head to break

401
00:44:34,860 --> 00:46:42,460
when we come back we'll have the third inning from car shield field welcome back

402
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:48,099
to car shield field this is the germa baseball association I am storm

403
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,820
Williamson joined by Gary grunt a 4-0 lead for the magicians and it's been

404
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,639
some good baseball this far very good baseball and I was able to get downed

405
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,639
into the locker room I asked if I can interview some of the players and they

406
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:07,480
said be with you in a minute so Richard Looney out there unicycling in center

407
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,480
field actually we've got three outfielders unicycling currently first

408
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,679
ball hit hard on the ground by Mick magic who recorded all three outs in the

409
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:20,519
last half inning he's retired by a strong throw from polka dot to open up

410
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:22,760
the third you can see what he was trying to do they're trying to get it to the

411
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,400
outfield where the outfielders are in on unicycle so he was a high chopping swing

412
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,360
just got over that ball and hit it to the shorts that great play that first

413
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,679
out worth noting that our only runs or first runs of this game I should say

414
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,800
came from a poof card and now we've got our second card of the game being played

415
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,480
this time by the circus who the understudy card looks to be being played

416
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,199
here from the circus we're gonna need we're gonna need the magicians mascot

417
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:58,369
you're on this one is opposing teams mascot much must pitch for this

418
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:04,400
happening this is a rare card and the California circus was able to pull this

419
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,000
power card and pregame and now we'll see Dumbledore look at this guy ill pitch

420
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,840
for at least this batter is at the entire inning look out knuckleball

421
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:22,219
pitcher heading to the mound your you have to be Dumbledore can

422
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:27,510
unspin it with the best of them wonderful bring his wand out or he'll

423
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:33,550
just use his hand some interesting moves there is he's gonna have to give way to

424
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:39,110
big boy buckle and you know before that poof card big boy buckle has really done

425
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,349
everything in his power to keep his California circus in this game yeah he's

426
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:47,469
changed up his delivery style he's gone quicker he's gone faster he tried to

427
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:51,429
cricket style delivery he's tried dealing it from the left side of the

428
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,989
mound right side of the mound he's really been trying to switch it up and

429
00:48:54,989 --> 00:49:00,829
keep these magician batters from getting comfortable inside that box and he's

430
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:05,909
calling a shot shot call there from number 31 I think so and he's gonna lay

431
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:13,429
down the bunt look at this Zeke flash hot dog beating it out the fake call your

432
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:19,500
shot he went Babe Ruth with it and he pulls down the bunt single what a play

433
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,980
the clowns are definitely caught off guard there magicians at it again take

434
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:28,980
a look on the fans Lee instant replay that's as good as it gets from the

435
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:38,659
flash what a what a trick pulled out of the hat there for the magicians getting

436
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:44,280
a runner on board a chance to add to their lead and as Dumbledore will face

437
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:50,519
batter number two Roy Flushman puts a bat on it and off the unicycle it goes

438
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:56,260
over the head artificial surface it's bouncy out there he ditched the

439
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:01,679
unicycle as well the runners will hold up at third base they do hold so we'll

440
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:07,800
see if Albertson wants to go out make sure make sure that's not an automatic

441
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,920
run or anything is again the right fielder was not on the unicycle dropped

442
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:19,099
it right there user error got over the head lost the wig boy what a clown show

443
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:26,619
oh we got our first pie in the face Albertson pie in the face Albertson the

444
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:32,460
circus one of that play called dead because oh and he is tossed he's gone

445
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:42,280
Albertson don't have any of that look at that Schmidt Papo Papo with the pie to the face and now

446
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,840
the magicians and excuse me now the mascots are chasing one another around

447
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,519
the field chaos has broken out here as a pie in the face I think that's Albertson's

448
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,119
50th pie to the face this season but he's no stranger to the pie in the face

449
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,039
he wears it well let's take another look at this pie in the face see the argument

450
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:08,380
happening at boom right there right in to the face is that shaving cream or

451
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,900
whipped cream he's not eating it so I can only assume that it's shaving cream

452
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:18,389
you know you would think a lot of umpires might be a little bit more upset

453
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:25,190
oh now he's just now he's just upset the turf monster got him tripped him up a

454
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:29,269
little bit he's tossing the rubber he's tossing the turf out of this game as

455
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:30,190
well

456
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:36,349
unbelievable and we'll see now maybe this gets maybe this gets joy handsome back

457
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:39,550
in the good graces of Albertson

458
00:51:40,429 --> 00:51:44,780
of course Albertson an ultimate professional doesn't want to wipe that

459
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,900
off just wants to keep play going in our official score if you're wondering if

460
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,579
you're scoring at home 9 on that play e9 on that play for your keep track at

461
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:58,059
home for this broadcast here tonight glad you're with us storm it's always a

462
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:14,409
pleasure to be alongside you and this is a real issue mascot now we had one of

463
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:19,409
these mascots called out for the card there's a reason yeah for double doors

464
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:24,900
should be there double doors should be there but the clown mascot needs to exit

465
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:32,440
the field he's holding up the pace of play here and now Albertson just just

466
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:39,329
exasperated here and I got a new batter coming to the plate says Ronnie Smith

467
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:46,630
first in to him hit on the ground sharply to short look him back poke it

468
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,670
out across the diamond it's too tall and it bounces into the stands

469
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,869
boy Ronnie with the least clever name on the magicians but that's a great

470
00:52:54,869 --> 00:53:00,949
baseball play they're showing the aggressiveness as Albertson now trying

471
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:06,829
to explain what happens here so they're going to give second base to Smith and

472
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:11,710
run another run scored I do believe so it should be five nothing run score run

473
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:20,170
Albertson confirms right on top of it polka dot apologize for the language our

474
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,610
effects Mike sometimes picks up some of the the on field language and we

475
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:28,130
apologize to our younger viewers if anyone was offended by that from the

476
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,530
umpire the heat of the battle you know there are a lot of things to learn out

477
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,210
here and as a ballplayer learning to curse at the right time is a big part of

478
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,889
the game yep and that'll be out number two run will score though on the chopper

479
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:42,329
to the left side what's the third base been doing it I don't think he thought

480
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:48,369
the hit or touch base and bringing it over to the first baseman guess he's

481
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:52,409
not confident and the throw across the diamond didn't want another run

482
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:56,769
advancing there is again the circus was just charged with another air on that

483
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:01,260
overthrow in the first baseman looks another runner at first now for the

484
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:05,480
magicians Percy throwing it all over the yard and now Donovan Slate comes to the

485
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:13,300
plate he had that big bases clearing triple back in the second inning still

486
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:21,050
dealing with with that really is a lot of pie in the face there for out here

487
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:27,329
crew chief Albertson and he's calling time and now he's headed out towards

488
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:32,730
towards right field I believe he's asked for the grounds crew something wrong

489
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,389
with the field right now and he'll go out for some inspection and as he's

490
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:41,630
calling the Empire is calling for the grounds crew and of course when you're

491
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:47,030
involved with any baseball league the grounds crew guy is really that makes

492
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:51,429
really makes the game go the way they keep up the field how they paint the

493
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:57,550
lines take care of the turf I'm not sure what Albertson sees out in the outfield

494
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,190
here it looks like there's an errant sheet there is here comes the grounds

495
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:07,869
keeper out of the right field bullpen oh look out look out breaks are on the

496
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:15,400
right side sir it's right just kidding around the lot it's right here so look oh

497
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:22,230
man yeah that's an arid piece an arid piece of grass here let's see what he

498
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:27,429
has to say you can get to listen in here on what Albertson has to say to the

499
00:55:27,429 --> 00:55:37,579
grounds crew definitely an artificial piece of grass has been placed on the

500
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:44,420
turf oh look at the tool he's getting out now you're gonna do a little no

501
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:59,059
okay okay unbelievable it's a manscaping I believe he is manscaping this field

502
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:04,170
right now that is that is the manscape trip look at the job it's doing I mean

503
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,769
that's a great job out of that trip maybe he could have used that manscaped

504
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:15,690
razor behind home plate you know we saw him tripping on earlier I think we're

505
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:21,329
having mic problems I think the pie to the face has affected the audio here so

506
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:29,079
what a good job of manscaping that piece of lawn pulling the pie right out of his

507
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:35,860
mic yeah and you saw Harry helium got a little swab of that pie on his way out

508
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,780
there and he approved maybe that's why crew chief Albertson not too upset about

509
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:44,099
that pie see in the background there the center fielder and right fielder trying

510
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:53,880
to stay warm as they get back on the unicycles left fielder right fielder

511
00:56:53,880 --> 00:57:07,309
using a boxing gloves here in this half inning so technical difficulties on the field Albertson is trying to get it

512
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:12,510
straight but he stopped time here he called time is again there's a out of

513
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:17,429
nowhere just a random piece of sod laid on the field and we can't have that as

514
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:23,030
it's not the same level as the artificial turf here so Albertson had to

515
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:27,989
do some manscaping this grounds crew you know a great job except for that one

516
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:34,010
patch and it makes you wonder here Gary is there ill intent to have this entire

517
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,929
place so pristine and almost as if they're trying to pull something on

518
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:41,769
Albertson here we saw behind home plate and now out in right field this is just

519
00:57:41,769 --> 00:57:46,650
ridiculous could be one of the classic magician illusions here just came out of

520
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,969
nowhere has to make you wonder if Isaac illusion had something to do with this

521
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:56,170
you it does make you wonder I did see a wand in the dugout oh look out for the

522
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,889
grounds crew guy who's gonna look out look out oh boy I mean he's got the

523
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:04,730
security man with them this is a lawsuit waiting to happen yeah driving

524
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,170
around and look out for the players now as I think now we need to get the

525
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,929
grounds crew guy and off the field security guy making sure everyone stays

526
00:58:11,929 --> 00:58:16,849
off as well so as I was saying right of course I forget about the fact that the

527
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:21,050
clowns the circus team thought it was really funny to knock the microphone out

528
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:24,510
with the five really great probably from the replay but anyways this is the

529

546

Manscaped that's a good call we do have a former caveman on our broadcast if you

547
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:05,630
haven't heard there is quite a bit of hair on his back that he does need to

548
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:10,349
tend to so we will hear from Gary a little bit later actually I believe he

549
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:14,510
is taking care of that rather quick says quite a bit about how well a job that

550
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,309
that Manscaped Razor does for you I was due for a shave at the back life

551

552
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:27,710
right down I think she might be knocking on my door I think that that hairy back

553
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,590
might have been what was doing it for you yeah playmate over there at third

Gary grunt and now the circus need to get something going here yeah

561
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:47,820
no more of a laughing matter they have got to get some runs and it has to start

562
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:55,800
right now Paul laughing tin we'll try to get it going he cracks one foul on to

563
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,199
the green stuff out in the left field territory foul territory excuse me

564
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,199
almost hit the basketball hoop on that left side of the field there's a

565
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:10,090
playground as well done that left side is how we're doing we'll get some more

566
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:16,889
balls to home plate as we've seen a couple of now hard-hit balls find the

567
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:23,130
stands some of that feel-good juice again for the magicians the elixir of

568
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:27,889
life if you will it makes you wonder if if Doug Dove is getting an unfair

569
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:35,219
advantage out here performance enhancing elixir is that what you're saying and

570
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:40,900
you know what the juice it does make you wonder as well is there a potential deal

571
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,860
with the drunkards in the works that's true too again the drunkards played the

572
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:48,900
bimes here a crunch time will be following our broadcast here tonight

573
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,659
Tom Chairman and Dickie Dreck will have highlights and full breakdowns of the

574
01:06:53,659 --> 01:06:57,739
games around the JBA today get the drunkards played the bimes not quite

575
01:06:57,739 --> 01:07:01,980
sure how many sober players the drunkards had today and then the caveman

576
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:07,860
versus the old ladies as well happening in the JBA get a look at that lineup for

577
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,340
the California circus so a reminder that postgame show coming your way after this

578
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:20,760
crunch time Dove Oh hidden ball trick it looked like

579
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:27,179
flight into right field long run hack comes off and the catch is made great

580
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:34,480
running catch by mystery the right fielder to go a long way

581
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:42,519
losses had in the process but kept the focus all magicians do with that play

582
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:48,239
Xavier McMagic giving his approval from Centerfield we saw him make three

583
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:54,639
straight catches out there in Centerfield in the second inning Dove

584
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:59,920
more hidden ball tricks as that one's fouled straight back off the pole by

585
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:07,650
Greg Taffy yeah Greg Laffy Taffy at the plate right now has plenty different

586
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:13,469
flavors and he can be successful with I think there's no doubt that the banana

587
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:18,390
flavor is hands down the best so he would love to pull a banana flavored hit

588
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:30,060
out of his pocket right here go down there from Taffy and you like that that

589
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,539
call from Elbertson behind home plate sometimes you're not sure where the

590
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:44,779
pitch missed Elbertson always lets you know make magic slowly the magical

591
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:54,699
elixir into the glove Xavier McMagic beer in hand this guy can do it all what a

592
01:08:54,699 --> 01:09:05,020
slab oh what a play falling down part of that entire plate not one drop of beer

593
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:11,619
lost not one even the circus have some appreciation for that is a man's play

594
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:16,539
right there what way the circus players getting involved with the fans here I

595
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:19,460
mean that look like I could be a good reason why they're trailing here five

596
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:22,819
nothing they're more focused on the antics of the game rather than playing

597
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:29,220
the game hunter sweets looking for a word of encouragement from his lady out

598
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:34,180
in the stands after getting caught stealing at second base earlier so after

599
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:44,380
the outstanding play here comes sweets trying to steal a little candy from fans

600
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:52,220
here to a knee for that one huge swing from hunter sweets but he comes up empty

601
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:56,779
the circus have been nothing short of a clown show thus far no I know it's a

602
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:07,300
moonwalk moonwalk strike call there from chief umpire Elbertson fall back play I

603
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,020
see the security guard now walking in the around the stands you can see him

604
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:17,739
there he's enjoying some of that nice elixir as well passes it off

605
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,500
we are in good hands here tonight nothing gonna happen here

606
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:30,659
security has done a nice job going with the backwards hat now keep within the

607
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:37,819
rules and regulations of the game and the ballpark fair oh two and sweets is

608
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:46,420
hit again breaks his bat stop stop them yeah wisely throws the broken bat away

609
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:50,380
doesn't want to get caught with a weapon security might have to come to the

610
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:58,180
field again to keep the fireworks up exploding here so the second time he's

611
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:03,779
been hit and warnings have been issued by Albertson doesn't want this hand

612
01:11:03,939 --> 01:11:09,659
game to get out of hand and you wonder if frustration might boil over here for

613
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:13,579
the circus they're losing this game big they've been hit by a pitch for the

614
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:16,819
second straight time and now their dugout gets worn for getting hit by the

615
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:23,590
pitch I think the magicians were trying to say he dove into that he wasn't

616
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:29,189
really hit by it okay they're going bonkers yeah try to break out the jack

617
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:37,130
hammer there's handsome on the mound trying to settle his group down he took

618
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:40,210
the pie to the face well but I don't know how well that jack hammer is gonna

619
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:44,289
go no no and that is exactly what the magicians are arguing they don't think

620
01:11:44,289 --> 01:11:47,350
that he was actually hit by the pitch they think it hit the bat and that's why

621
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:51,289
the bat broke so we'll see what Albertson comes what kind of conclusion

622
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:57,449
he comes to well we have a runner-on first for the California circus

623
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:03,930
joy handsome has made his way back onto the bad side of Albertson let's go let's

624
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:13,060
go let's go Joey handsome manager for the magicians

625
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:24,310
don't have an assistant here they're highly sought after though polka dot who

626
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:28,069
has popped nine home runs this year

627
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:35,770
trick the third out of the inning the magicians pull out the wand create a

628
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:39,970
little magic and illusion and they're out of this inning store we saw dub do

629
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:45,289
it on the mound and now they do it at first base Albertson all over it we're

630
01:12:45,289 --> 01:12:51,250
still at a five nothing score as we go to the fourth inning a big argument come

631
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:56,210
in here you can just see it right now you can see the unhappiness written all

632
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:00,250
over the face of the circus manager we'll bring in the conclusion of this

633
01:13:00,250 --> 01:16:40,829
showdown when we come back you're watching JBA baseball welcome back to

634
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:44,550
the German Baseball Association a five-nothing lead for the Maryland

635
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:51,470
magicians over the California circus and here is Mike Salmon leading things off

636
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:57,810
and oh my this could go on for a while oh my goodness this this is not this is

637
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:03,010
not good all that all came out of his eyeball ribbon in the eye that's no fun

638
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:07,930
you might need some eye drops to the field really makes you wonder he reached

639
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:12,890
base his first time up with all of that in in the back was that hiding in his

640
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:16,250
brain where where did that come from even more impressive that he was able to

641
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:21,649
get the first inning single with all that and his eye unbelievable we talked

642
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:25,770
he loves the adversity we talked about him swimming upstream and now he takes

643
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:33,210
it in the ass oh no nobody who ever wants to take it that way hit by the

644
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:39,649
pitch and big top or excuse me big boy buckle thrown out of the game and

645
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:43,649
the magicians are out of the office or out of their dugout they want buckle

646
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:49,250
out of this game is again both teams have been warned here buckle has been

647
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:54,090
ushered to the turf his catcher trying to restrain him void hunch is being

648
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,850
thrown don't need a long-term suspension here for the circus skin

649
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:03,090
playing for playoff positioning so Albertson letting the next pitcher

650
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:06,050
down there's no messing around he already warned both dugouts in the

651
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:10,210
previous inning no more hit batters and the first batter of this top half of

652
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:14,449
this fourth inning gets drilled as you said it says you said storm right in the

653
01:18:14,449 --> 01:18:21,970
ass goodness that that cannot feel good first of all and second big boy on the

654
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:26,529
mound I mean there was no fear in crew chief Albertson right there when he

655
01:18:26,529 --> 01:18:30,210
tossed him out of the game I don't want big boy buckle coming after me I don't

656
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,930
know about you I'm just not gonna throw him out of the game and I want to be

657
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:39,770
taking the dinner before someone goes after my ass now we got another card

658
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:46,930
being played here and and dying oh boy our card it's a rare power card let's

659
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:58,539
let's get a closer look at this one got to run backwards to the bases the whole

660
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:05,380
happening backwards through the bases hole any so all base runners will be

661
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:16,399
running backwards this could be big-time trouble we've already seen hunter suites

662
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,199
caught stealing running forwards I can only imagine backwards yeah I believe

663
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:24,979
this is the third power card we've seen here in this game so both managers have

664
01:19:24,979 --> 01:19:28,579
done a nice job of implementing and choosing and picking their spots wisely

665
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:33,739
of when to play that power card oh big boy buckle back on the field he can't

666
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:38,140
do this I believe this is Greg Taffy oh who has come in to replace oh goodness

667
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:43,220
and we got more theatrics going on now I believe this is big boys come out back

668
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:47,340
yeah big boy felt bad for his teammates thought they needed some refreshments

669
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,699
they you know they've obviously seen the magicians drink on the field so why not

670
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:55,859
give it a try the other team you know it ain't cheating ain't trying so

671
01:19:55,859 --> 01:20:02,500
Albertson's patience is wearing thin here see yep she's trying to oh he's out

672
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:06,819
there buckle brought the pie yeah oh oh goodness I think he was just bringing

673
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:09,779
some drinks to his fellow partners exactly what he was doing and we've seen

674
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:14,369
the turf monster pop up a couple of times here tonight so all the more

675
01:20:14,369 --> 01:20:18,970
reason to get that manscaper back out exactly that that manscaped razor did

676
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:23,170
wonders out in right field we've seen some nice plays out there in right field

677
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:27,010
and got some uneven blades out there right now the manscape for 4.0 would be

678
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:30,970
a great job speaking of right field by the way right now it's unmanned now the

679
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:34,569
right fielder is retreating back to his position but I'm worried about left

680
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:38,409
field and center field right now they just do not look very engaged right now

681
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:42,529
partner hey you saw no they don't they they've checked out of this game and now

682
01:20:42,529 --> 01:20:47,329
we see another pitcher going into the bullpen with the backup catcher so Taffy

683
01:20:47,329 --> 01:20:51,729
gets tapped here the tall right-hander has a rotor on first base and the power

684
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:56,130
card was played so all runners will now have to run backwards this entire inning

685
01:20:56,130 --> 01:21:00,810
throw down the first hold on he retreated back to that bag in a forward style

686
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:05,930
crew chief Albertson has not called him on it no he has not and the first baseman

687
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:10,930
wanted to call there didn't get it and that is one of the really important

688
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:16,890
things to note here Gary is in these situations you have to turn yourself

689
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:20,689
around to run backwards back to the bag you can't just run back forward you have

690
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:23,850
to go back to the training field you know this doesn't happen all the time so

691
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:27,569
you have to rely on your training relying on what you've done get you to

692
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:31,489
this moment and just focus on making sure you're back pedaling toes to the

693
01:21:31,489 --> 01:21:34,850
ground first each toe back pedal left right left right focus on that and you

694
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:39,609
should be fine almost muscle memory for Mike salmon over at first base the pitch

695
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:45,489
to Donald strange and it's a call strike a big wind-up strike there from Albertson

696
01:21:46,489 --> 01:22:03,000
more impressive wind-up taffy or Albertson on the ground chopped towards

697
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,119
second base of backpedaling salmon tagged out and they turned to what a

698
01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:13,920
double play there again the power card and doing magic right now for on the

699
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,760
other side for the for the circuses they played they run for our making sure

700
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:25,880
those runners run backwards great tag great throw over and just just speed

701
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,359
from number 20 there is again the on the base passing at the back pedal all the

702
01:22:30,359 --> 01:22:34,000
way to the dugout as well oh here come the mascots again oh my

703
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,600
goodness we've got a big-time brawl about to break out the mascots are going

704
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:47,079
at it oh they catch her for the circus got a couple unnecessary shots in there

705
01:22:47,079 --> 01:22:53,199
on Dumbledore oh no this this could be huge problems they are now they have now

706
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,920
exited the field of play and I don't think this is ending anytime soon

707
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,399
partner we've seen this before these two have got some serious beef they've gone

708
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:04,840
at it the last few times these teams have gotten together this could end

709
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,399
ugly a couple of right-handed uppercuts from Dumbledore and they are going at it

710
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,800
on the dugout for the California circuses what no one told you about

711
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,079
Dumbledore is that in his younger days he was a boxing he was a boxer training

712
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:23,960
with Mike Tyson he's showing off the moves this is Nolan Ryan and ask yeah

713
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:29,770
continue Robin Ventura and Nolan Ryan basically right there as Dumbledore

714
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,329
continuing to pummel with the rights security guard is going to get the

715
01:23:33,329 --> 01:23:38,409
jackhammer is and you know what at least California has something to be happy

716
01:23:38,409 --> 01:23:41,890
about at this point indeed as they're trying to throw show some fight show some

717
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,930
spirit but unfortunately Dumbledore was a little too much for the clown and

718
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:52,930
mascot showdown let's circle back to the manager for the circus Fred Big Top how

719
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:56,890
about the timing of that card that he pulls out there with the runner on first

720
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,890
to lead off the inning they get the double play now two outs and nobody on

721
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:05,050
as that one is shot down the left field line slicing into the corner it's a

722
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:11,340
fair ball and it hops over the wall for a ground rule double that ground rule

723
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:20,600
double it so yeah a little backpedal into second base as it's given to him

724
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,880
sprayed that ball down the left side of the field that you see a good cut here

725
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:31,079
off of the breaking ball did a nice job to stay back make good contact and ride

726
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:35,960
over the Grotto Beast sign the way he keeps his hands inside the baseball

727
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:41,079
there on that fans Lee replay but going back to what you're talking about there

728
01:24:41,079 --> 01:24:45,359
store William said about that power card being played at the right time the

729
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:50,439
manager for the California circus oh no it's gone into the locker down with the

730
01:24:50,439 --> 01:24:56,960
mascots oh boy and this is what we always wanted to see look at this right

731
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,520
those uppercuts in time oh no the counter now the Dumbledore finally

732
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,760
taking some shots this has gotten interesting he stays he's dazed and

733
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:11,260
confused look at this now they're making out oh my goodness a hate fest is turned

734
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,939
into all love I don't even want to know what's happening there porn stuff is

735
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:22,659
this and the backpedaling player gets past third base coming home it's a good

736
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:32,140
throw the backwards slide he's out unbelievable play Xavier McMagic gun down

737
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:38,699
at the plate yeah McMagic just a step to slow there a great throw from the left

738
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:42,979
fielder to end that inning it all goes back to that power card being played got

739
01:25:42,979 --> 01:25:48,859
that double play is this the momentum changer the circus beat up the

740
01:25:48,859 --> 01:25:54,300
magicians mascot and trail it by five we head to the fifth inning you're watching

741
01:25:54,300 --> 01:26:06,229
Jerma Baseball Association

742
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:09,479
you

743
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:48,859
welcome back you get a look at crew chief Albertson in command of this game

744
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:51,859
we're in the bottom of the fourth inning it's a five-nothing lead for the

745
01:27:51,859 --> 01:27:57,140
Maryland magicians over the California circus another look at Doug Dove on the

746
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:02,619
mound he will go to work once again against this circus order he has had

747
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:09,020
all kinds of success so far and former Hall of Fame caveman Gary grunt tell us

748
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:12,739
what's been going so well for them so far in this game well the additions have

749
01:28:12,739 --> 01:28:17,340
done a very good job of you know taking advantage of getting good pitches to hit

750
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,659
and then driving those balls in the gap scoring those runs and you hope on the

751
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:24,939
other side right now if you're a circus fan they string together some

752
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:28,979
consecutive hits here only one hit right now through the first four innings Percy

753
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:34,340
polka dot hitting a robust 282 on the year in slugging for 44 you'd have to

754
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:38,500
think this would be the guy to break them out if anyone yeah the magicians

755
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:43,500
are employer have deployed an interesting outfield strategy here that's

756
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,659
three center fielders right now nobody in left or right field so we'll see how

757
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:51,779
this works out for the magicians you know there's a lot of conversation out

758
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:56,619
there in center field I think they all just want to play center field they're

759
01:28:56,619 --> 01:28:59,539
kind of pointing towards the other outfield positions trying to get each

760
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:03,460
other to go out there but they have all been determined to play centerfield in

761
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:06,300
this anyway that's the position you want to play they don't want to give it up

762
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:12,340
and you know ballplayers you know aren't really they want to fight for their for

763
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,220
that position that they play they want they don't want another position they

764
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:18,300
want to play center field right now we've got three of them for the magicians

765
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,819
out of course out of Maryland as you mentioned earlier it's a coastal battle

766
01:29:22,819 --> 01:29:27,300
with California taking on a team squad the magicians out of Maryland and

767
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:32,020
meanwhile Doug Dove has lost his command a bit on the mound he opens up this

768
01:29:32,020 --> 01:29:36,659
bottom of the fourth with a four-pitch walk to the leadoff man and now it's the

769
01:29:36,659 --> 01:29:40,779
three-hitter David Honk coming up for the circus it feels like this is their

770
01:29:40,779 --> 01:29:44,939
chance right here and we're getting some beer man beer man is on the field

771
01:29:44,939 --> 01:29:49,180
bringing some libations out to those three centerfielders they needed a

772
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:55,899
he's wet that whistle the hard work out there in center and I'll tell you what

773
01:29:55,899 --> 01:30:01,020
the more impaired these magicians seem to get the better they seem to play

774
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:08,899
yeah until now a blast in the left center field and it will one hop the wall he

775
01:30:08,899 --> 01:30:12,939
was pipping that one the whole way David Honk not running out of the box

776
01:30:12,939 --> 01:30:17,300
they had him at second base if it was an accurate throw he's still going to third

777
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:24,979
as the throw got away he's thinking home here he comes no tag

778
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:39,140
oh good move the circus is on the board the swift move the offensive lineman

779
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:45,020
going up against a defensive lineman gets to the quarterback and a run is scored

780
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:51,899
David Honk showing off the defensive end skills look at that blast off of the

781
01:30:51,899 --> 01:30:55,500
bat yeah you got not quite all of it but enough to get it to the wall and the

782
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,739
three centerfielders went to track that one down surprised didn't get it over

783
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:03,659
for a ground rule double but good hustle around the base pass to get that run

784
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:07,819
across the board two runs across the board magicians manager joy handsome

785
01:31:07,819 --> 01:31:13,380
contesting the call but indeed that ball was dropped as you get a look at Doug

786
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,020
Doug there's a swim move we talked about just could not handle that swim too

787
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:22,859
powerful yeah it's way too powerful from David Honk and you know some of you out

788
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:27,220
there may have played a little MLB slugfest in your day great move there

789
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:32,220
from David Honk one of the classic moves that you will ever see in the JBA he

790
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:36,699
basically pulled many of our viewers may have played slugfest but what about some

791
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:41,069
NFL blitz pulled out a nice NFL blitz move there well he pulled out to bomb

792
01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:46,989
with the bat in his hands and then he turned on the Jets coming home so two

793
01:31:46,989 --> 01:31:53,470
runs across for the circus you know storm my friend worked in a circus one

794
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:58,109
time he was a human cannonball when he retired it didn't replace him I couldn't

795
01:31:58,109 --> 01:32:03,829
find anyone else's the same caliber that that is just really a shame you know the

796
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:10,270
caliber of this circus team incredible but they have it's heating up right now

797
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:17,369
they try to stay off of her try to get another run on first base but a great

798
01:32:17,409 --> 01:32:22,869
play by the magicians and maybe they've settled back down and as we have another

799
01:32:22,869 --> 01:32:27,229
break in the action here is here comes the jest the clown gestures from the

800
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:32,989
California circus heading to the mound the jugglers oh this now this is

801
01:32:32,989 --> 01:32:38,670
something that could really get dub dub off of his game he surrendered his first

802
01:32:38,670 --> 01:32:42,949
two runs of the game in this inning and now we talked about some of those

803
01:32:42,949 --> 01:32:47,229
distractions that the starting pitcher big boy buckle had to deal with well now

804
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:51,750
the tables have turned let's see how the magicians can deal I mean this is

805
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:56,750
this is not an easy thing it's hard to juggle those pins in the first place but

806
01:32:56,750 --> 01:33:01,430
to try to pitch with them going in front of you behind you and now look at this

807
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:07,949
another cop power card look like a baby card being played but the baby that's a

808
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:12,989
legendary card chosen player must wear a baby bib and baby bonnet for their next

809
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:18,069
bat if they do not get a hit and add three runs for your team score and I'll

810
01:33:18,069 --> 01:33:23,069
tell you what there's a reason why this is a legendary card Gary this is the

811
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:30,229
most demoralizing card in JBA play if you do not successfully complete the

812
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:36,470
baby bib hit it is one of the biggest game changers in this sport we could see

813
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:41,350
a tie ball game after this at bat yeah we absolutely could and certainly don't

814
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:45,789
want the embarrassment of having to wear a grown-up having to wear a baby bib but

815
01:33:45,789 --> 01:33:50,350
that's just the way we played here in the JBA and I'm just super impressed

816
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:55,149
right now with the jugglers oh they just knocked the hat off of Doug Dove getting

817
01:33:55,149 --> 01:33:59,670
a little chirping out for the magicians bench the circus is really rounding into

818
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:07,989
form right now in town right now look at all this look at the skill are you

819
01:34:08,029 --> 01:34:17,409
kidding me crew chief Albertson I think he called himself out umpire panda well

820
01:34:17,409 --> 01:34:22,329
you know what when you when you have an out call as legendary as crew chief

821
01:34:22,329 --> 01:34:26,489
Albertson you can't help but call yourself out time and time again no no

822
01:34:26,489 --> 01:34:31,409
and Albertson showing off the the multi-talented skills that he has and

823
01:34:31,850 --> 01:34:39,250
maybe we have seen him in the past do the spinning plate trick with a unicycle

824
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:43,689
so he toned it down just a little bit there we've seen him in the earlier this

825
01:34:43,689 --> 01:34:48,170
season where he did it with a unicycle and now the beer guy the magician side

826
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:57,420
of it there's our baby bib there this is a huge moment in this game yep there's

827
01:34:57,420 --> 01:35:01,779
the baby bottle Manny up Chuck where's that bib as good as any of them that's a

828
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:09,539
large nipple on that bottle our fabulous crew helping out as well what size

829
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:14,020
diaper do you think that is Gary that is a 38 large for sure

830
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:21,819
that can hold some liquid 38 large and you know we know can hold some liquid

831
01:35:21,819 --> 01:35:27,939
the problem is you know if up Chuck deposits some solids into that thing how

832
01:35:27,939 --> 01:35:32,460
long will it last not very long we've had some bleed-through issues with a

833
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:38,340
recall problem with these particular branded diapers so as far as I understand

834
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:43,380
the payload is is 30 pounds so as long as Manny up Chuck does not exceed that

835
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:47,619
weight he should be okay up chucking is fine they don't any down chucking right

836
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:52,979
now that is a great point and that's why we bring oh he maybe wanted to bring the

837
01:35:52,979 --> 01:35:57,579
bottle to the bait to the to the plate so you're not allowed to do that no

838
01:35:57,579 --> 01:36:02,340
bottles only libation bottles elixir bottles no baby bottles allow that

839
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:11,260
hopefully so here we go should be a lot of action in the hips here if up Chuck

840
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,800
does not pick up a hit excuse me it would be Maryland to pick up the three

841
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,420
runs and be out to an eight to two lead up Chuck calls time understanding this

842
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:24,739
is a veteran move here by up Chuck he may be wearing a diaper but this this is

843
01:36:24,739 --> 01:36:33,220
not his first time in the box no sir love the bonnet first pitch from dove

844
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:39,060
skips in and he pops it up just past the shortstop tough play but it's made

845
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:45,180
and that'll add three more onto the board for the Magicians yeah you have to

846
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:48,180
wonder if he should have just taken that pitch it bounced in front of the plate

847
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:51,899
maybe got a little antsy wanted to create something for his team is see

848
01:36:51,899 --> 01:37:01,140
bouncing well in front of home plate it's a sand wedge to short center field

849
01:37:01,699 --> 01:37:08,819
we saw some some Vlad Guerrero types theatrics earlier in this game I called

850
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:13,300
out each year oh at the time both of them have had their their call at it and

851
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:17,899
now Doug Dove looking back towards his defense oh what do we got going on here

852
01:37:17,899 --> 01:37:24,689
you'll spin turn fire for a strike trying to change up the delivery here in

853
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:31,029
the California Circus now trailing eight to two they've got to start

854
01:37:31,069 --> 01:37:34,670
stringing together some consecutive hits only two hits in the ball game right

855
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:45,789
now for the circus Harry helium at the dish dove very slow methodical molasses

856
01:37:45,789 --> 01:37:51,949
like as he shakes off the pitch a little shimmy the EFIS is grounded toward short

857
01:37:51,949 --> 01:38:00,229
charging in and the play is not made because now all of a sudden he's trying

858
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:03,550
to row row row the boat down that first baseline not enough water to get him to

859
01:38:03,550 --> 01:38:09,750
first it was it was not working well you know if if maybe up Chuck had left a

860
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:13,949
trail of tears deep enough for him he could have been able to paddle his way

861
01:38:13,949 --> 01:38:19,670
but it will fans another reminder this game brought to you by fans Lee a spicy

back after this

865
01:39:42,630 --> 01:45:36,409
welcome back to car shield field where the Maryland magicians own an eight to

866
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:40,930
two lead over the California Circus I'm storm Williamson alongside Gary grunt

867
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:46,409
get a look at crew chief Albertson down there on the field and this has been a

868
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:51,409
game owned by the magicians that baby card pulled out the legendary card and

869
01:45:51,409 --> 01:45:55,130
the baby bib did not treat the circus well just when it looked like they were

870
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:59,460
getting some momentum three runs right back on the board to the magicians a two

871
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:03,819
lead down for the magicians a slight delay here before we start the top of

872
01:46:03,819 --> 01:46:06,699
the fifth year I believe there was a bathroom break that had to be had for

873
01:46:06,699 --> 01:46:14,899
some of the players so the pregame meal was some hot spicy food so I think some

874
01:46:14,899 --> 01:46:20,180
players had to run to the restroom to take care of that yeah some some things

875
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:24,899
definitely that needed to be taken care of we're not sure how much of it ended up

876
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:32,220
in the dive uh-oh uh-oh look at this illusion put out the tricks now up still

877
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:40,619
pulling up still pulling oh Roy Flushman no no wait wait come on here's all this

878
01:46:40,619 --> 01:46:48,890
coming from there we go the hats for bats keep bats warm

879
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:56,460
fans we want to remind you about surf shark you know what geo blocking is

880
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:01,939
Disney Plus or Netflix for example have movies for each country access should

881
01:47:01,939 --> 01:47:06,500
not be tied to nationality surf shark gives you all the access you need just

882
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:11,979
connect the service and refresh the page access granted I use surf shark every

883
01:47:11,979 --> 01:47:16,340
day it automatically starts up whenever I start my PC and whenever I need it I

884
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:20,619
activate it with just one click if it's good enough for storm it's good enough

885
01:47:20,619 --> 01:47:26,500
for you absolutely I love me you got to love you some you oh look at this look

886
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:31,340
at this a little backhanded fake throw and it goes for a ball but you love the

887
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:42,260
idea from a Laffy Taffy yep absolutely as it is Flushman at the plate drone

888
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:46,859
screaming behind home plate and that one's taken up so Flushman has found

889
01:47:46,859 --> 01:47:50,380
himself ahead in the count he's you know against Greg Taffy ahead of the comp had

890
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:55,819
a nice little pull out the ribbon trick out of the tin can oh babe has called his

891
01:47:55,819 --> 01:48:04,260
shot Flushman oh right over right over the surf surf shark sign and he pops it

892
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:07,020
up in the shallow center he was just pointing to the shallow center that's

893
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:09,659
where he was pointing so that's exactly what he wanted to do and he pulls it off

894
01:48:09,659 --> 01:48:15,220
the shallow centerfield pop-up so that's exactly what he wanted to do that's not

895
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:19,380
one you see executed every day no no you have to keep yourself up out like that

896
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:24,260
it's such an unselfish thing to do for your team and it takes some guts to call

897
01:48:24,260 --> 01:48:28,659
that shot it's not one you see every day so I guess he said look I got this in my

898
01:48:28,659 --> 01:48:33,699
back pocket no problem he left all this magic in his pre-game pre at bat routine

899
01:48:33,699 --> 01:48:39,819
they're pulling all that yarn out of the can see what kind of magic mystery has

900
01:48:39,819 --> 01:48:48,340
in store for us Craig gets jammed on the first pitch from behind it before it hit

901
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:56,939
the ground he's got it in his glove we're trying to get rid of his gear oh

902
01:48:56,939 --> 01:49:03,819
this is why you tune into the JBA immediately out of the dugout Joy

903
01:49:03,819 --> 01:49:19,590
Handsome is livid we saw the whole way that ball never touched the ground that

904
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:22,430
in glove he heard it right there from Albertson net glove at the same time

905
01:49:22,430 --> 01:49:28,909
that's an hour on believable play made by a hunter sweets he's been plunked by

906
01:49:28,909 --> 01:49:33,590
two pitches in this game and now some payback I think it's about the eight or

907
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:37,710
ninth warning that Albertson is given toward the magicians bench for all the

908
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:43,069
talking they've been doing got two outs here in the top of the fifth inning

909
01:49:43,069 --> 01:49:46,670
nobody aboard I think it's after the 10th in or the 10th warning or someone

910
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:51,510
will get thrown out so a couple more warnings before someone gets tossed

911
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:56,869
it floats in there and it's a call strike the circus in town creating a

912
01:49:56,869 --> 01:50:01,390
little magic of their own and I think you know during that bathroom break Taffy

913
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:05,470
may have drug out a little tissue with him as well

914
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:12,460
you'll toilet paper on the heel of the shoe trick huh the left handers it's

915
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:17,619
called himself out and that's the second time he's done that so Albertson is is

916
01:50:17,619 --> 01:50:23,220
down to one out now in this game three outs and you're done we all know how

917
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:35,050
that works Taffy with a one-in-one count facing Ronnie Smith the pitch Ronnie

918
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:38,810
tattoos it into the gap in left center field it gets down for a base hit

919
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:46,380
another hit for the magicians good piece of hitting and what is this

920
01:50:47,579 --> 01:50:54,260
that's some camaraderie there between opposing teams Wow and we'll see how

921
01:50:54,260 --> 01:51:00,659
these opposing dugouts take to this as you see I do know he's a free agent at

922
01:51:00,659 --> 01:51:03,340
the end of the year perhaps some collusion going on some tampering

923
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:07,180
perhaps they come play for the California Circus Harry he'll play for

924
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:11,819
the magicians anymore helium trying to plead his case over there hit sharply

925
01:51:11,819 --> 01:51:16,859
towards second base another nice play made over there solid as can be all day

926
01:51:16,859 --> 01:51:22,199
long for Paul Laffington we're going to break here we'll be back with the bottom

927
01:51:22,199 --> 01:51:26,159
of the fifth inning when we come back eight to two Maryland on top of

928
01:51:26,159 --> 01:54:53,489
California you're watching JBA action the magic out to an eight to two lead

929
01:54:53,489 --> 01:55:00,090
over the California Circus you're watching JBA baseball with the bunny on

930
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:04,729
screen for you right there that's as good as it gets that's a great illusion

931
01:55:04,729 --> 01:55:16,470
what was he gonna do let's see another trick sir it reminds me of the time back

932
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:21,449
in my caveman playing days where we tried to order a pizza big game and the

933
01:55:21,449 --> 01:55:24,670
operator in the other end we made the call from the dugout we ordered a large

934
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:29,390
pepperoni and he said do you want that in 16 slices or in eight slices so I

935
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:33,750
said I don't think we need 16 slices let's just make it eight you know that's

936
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:37,869
that's a real a good call you would think though that the cavemen would have

937
01:55:37,869 --> 01:55:44,310
the appetite to put down 16 slices but you know eight far far less pizza to eat

938
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:50,310
yes large pizza cut into eight pieces instead of 16 it's much more manageable

939
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:55,029
for a group of our the team that we had back there for the caveman certainly

940
01:55:55,029 --> 01:55:58,590
certainly you know I can't wait to get the postgame report from the crunch time

941
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:04,890
and see how the caveman did today that is a really really important thing for

942
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:09,909
fans to look forward to germination we have a postgame show coming your way at

943
01:56:09,909 --> 01:56:14,789
the conclusion of this one crunch time as you heard Gary grunt allude to it and

944
01:56:14,789 --> 01:56:20,189
Gary on his way to the cavemen Hall of Fame and that's got to be not only a

945
01:56:20,189 --> 01:56:23,510
great honor for you Gary but it's gonna be a lot of fun to go out there and be

946
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:27,149
back with the guys that you won a championship back when in 2017 with yeah

947
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:31,630
it was a great time and a great journey to be with the caveman and I'm happy to

948
01:56:31,630 --> 01:56:36,829
donate my back hair to the Hall of Fame for the caveman as well so it should be

949
01:56:36,829 --> 01:56:41,189
a fun ceremony libations will be had and be good to see some of my old teammates

950
01:56:41,189 --> 01:56:46,229
and a lot of people don't know this but we're actually suffering in our world

951
01:56:46,229 --> 01:56:49,630
today from a back hair shortage and if it weren't for people like you Gary

952
01:56:49,630 --> 01:56:53,270
there there just wouldn't be enough to go around so we appreciate what you do

953
01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:57,750
for the good people of not only the German Baseball Association but looking

954
01:56:57,750 --> 01:57:01,430
out for the greater good as well and so it's not locks of love you know it's

955
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:05,550
curly curly hair for love is curly back hair for love is what we're trying to

956
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:09,229
do it just trying to ways awareness that you know some men out there can't grow

957
01:57:09,229 --> 01:57:13,510
back hair and others like myself have some to give and just trying to help the

958
01:57:13,510 --> 01:57:18,310
community make them a little hairier that's a little bit more caveman from

959
01:57:18,350 --> 01:57:24,630
from the heart of our Hall of Famer Gary grunt three and one the count to Lenny

960
01:57:24,630 --> 01:57:31,510
Munson you hear that that famed little grunt there from Gary and you know when

961
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:35,670
you play behind home plate there there are plenty of times where hey you got a

962
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:41,109
reach for that baseball you got to do this or that just a natural grunt it's

963
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:44,789
the job done in those situations it really started as kind of a joke as you

964
01:57:44,789 --> 01:57:50,109
know as I tended to pass a lot of gas you know behind home plate so it'd be a

965
01:57:50,109 --> 01:57:53,909
little loud and I didn't want Albertson to hear it so I would grunt a little bit

966
01:57:53,909 --> 01:57:59,310
and then a little you know a little so he couldn't tell the difference if it

967
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:04,430
was Gary that that is a poof card that Albertson was just never ready for no

968
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:12,229
no and I had a lot of poofs in my day so check this out we got all the circus

969
01:58:12,229 --> 01:58:16,909
trying to get into the Magicians dugout and a balloon fight balloon sword fight

970
01:58:16,909 --> 01:58:22,029
has broken out here Albertson tried to get this under order but the circus has

971
01:58:22,029 --> 01:58:35,479
broken loose is that is that poppo Schmidt poppo after being thrown out of

972
01:58:35,479 --> 01:58:39,760
the game gets back out there to get involved in the in the balloon fight

973
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:43,039
the league will take notice of that once you've been ejected you come back on

974
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:47,079
the field you could face suspension so we'll see if the league wants to take a

975
01:58:47,079 --> 01:58:51,760
look at that look at it Albertson even appreciates this gag here from the

976
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,279
circus so we'll see if if you know that positive reinforcement from our crew

977
01:58:56,279 --> 01:58:59,800
chief gives them that momentum we've been talking about it for quite a while

978
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:04,880
now this is a circus team that came into this game with three more wins than the

979
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,770
Maryland Magicians still no outs here run around first for the California

980
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:14,010
Circus three centerfielders once again for the Magicians they imported in the

981
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:17,329
last couple innings now and I think the guys are just having a good time just

982
01:59:17,329 --> 01:59:20,010
gabbing like a couple of schoolgirls out there and you know when you're up by

983
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:27,000
six a little socialization is is in play so the Magicians take advantage and look out

984
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:34,239
another hit batter look out oh false alarm false alarm and you know that was that was a

985
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:40,000
really aggressive run towards the mound by Paul Laffington he took a 90 degree

986
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,119
turn towards first pace right as he got close to our picture Victor vanish on the

987
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:51,000
mound for the Maryland Magicians and decided to make a no laughing matter for

988
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,520
Laughington as we now have runners on first and second for the California

989
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:04,189
Circus they'll try and trapeze themselves into a couple of runs here a

990
02:00:04,189 --> 02:00:09,770
catapulting effort would be the one that they're looking for right now and here

991
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:20,789
comes Fred Big Top and now he's joined with Joy Hansel now look Joy clearly has

992
02:00:20,789 --> 02:00:24,750
the better looks and he's going to try to demoralize Fred Big Top call him a

993
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:39,430
crybaby there you saw the crybaby motion I was just gonna say move for the

994
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:47,949
power move on top of the power car being played this other coach must wear a bag

995
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:53,229
on his head for the rest of the inning so the bulk managers go at it and the

996
02:00:53,229 --> 02:00:58,949
circus manager pulls out the lights out car and this is the type of stuff that

997
02:00:58,949 --> 02:01:04,670
has Fred Big Top in the discussion for manager of the year in the JBA this year

998
02:01:04,670 --> 02:01:11,270
look at this he shoves joy handsome down to the turf and now personally goes

999
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:18,500
over to put the bag on his head emphatically coach is definitely in the

1000
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:36,119
bag now as that was bag tastic Elbertson the manager getting it into it with one

1001
02:01:36,119 --> 02:01:44,079
of the fans the magician fans near the dugout so you got to wonder how the

1002
02:01:44,119 --> 02:01:51,100
magicians manager can manage this game he can't see right now so see what kind of

1003
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:56,060
defense he wants to implement as you can see the shot right there he is in the

1004
02:01:56,060 --> 02:02:03,659
bag right now can't see he's got his bag but you know his his outfielder is still

1005
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:08,100
on that same page they are just doing whatever they want out there and you

1006
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:12,340
know that was that was pre bag on the head as well so maybe the magicians have

1007
02:02:12,380 --> 02:02:24,020
just been in their bag this entire time. Good pitch. Taffy tips it into the mitt

1008
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:30,600
there Vanish feeling himself after that delivery and Vanish does like to feel

1009
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:36,729
himself a lot although he seems to disappear rather quickly we have seen a

1010
02:02:36,729 --> 02:02:40,329
lot of hit batters in this game check behind the runner at second base it

1011
02:02:40,329 --> 02:02:44,609
bounces off of the shortstop and stays right in his general vicinity so thought

1012
02:02:44,609 --> 02:02:49,170
that one was going to center field is it looked like it took a bad hop there

1013
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:54,970
you're going to look at this from the knees Donovan Slate is in a straight

1014
02:02:54,970 --> 02:03:00,329
jacket at second base so you know double play situation that's going to make it

1015
02:03:00,329 --> 02:03:04,409
really tough to turn very tough but we've seen the likes of a player with

1016
02:03:04,409 --> 02:03:09,250
his caliber make good plays with his feet and kick the ball over nicely so no

1017
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:14,229
stranger to the straight jacket and that's something that the JBA really

1018
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:19,789
brings out is you know you watch players in regular baseball leagues and it's

1019
02:03:19,789 --> 02:03:23,670
it's just not that impressive the skill set does not need to be that wide you

1020
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:27,149
better run backwards in this league get a fly ball out into center field all

1021
02:03:27,149 --> 02:03:30,750
three of them have a look at it the center center fielder chucked his glove

1022
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:34,390
but didn't come up with it it's the left center fielder with the play yeah and

1023
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:37,829
they fire home to keep the runners put a selfish play by the center center

1024
02:03:37,829 --> 02:03:41,909
fielder they're trying to make the play without his glove trying to put a hex on

1025
02:03:41,909 --> 02:03:45,710
the glove to make that catch you'll see it right here the guy in the center of

1026
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:51,829
the center field almost caught it but the left center fielder got it and made

1027
02:03:51,829 --> 02:03:59,590
the out two down here bag is still on oh my goodness

1028
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:08,590
trichotomous this is a game-breaker all runs now we're three in this half inning

1029
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:16,300
wow this could easily put the circus right back into this game should we get

1030
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:21,939
a base hit here game tying run standing at second base with only one out here

1031
02:04:21,939 --> 02:04:27,020
in the bottom of the fifth inning and all the while joy handsome has a bag

1032
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:35,970
over his head hunter sweets like candy is got a golden opportunity for the

1033
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:40,850
California circus right here hunter sweets came to the plate as the leadoff

1034
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:44,810
man for the circus in the bottom of the first inning hit by a pitch on an o2

1035
02:04:44,810 --> 02:04:49,529
count came up in his second at bat in the third with an o2 count he was hit by

1036
02:04:49,529 --> 02:04:53,689
the pitch and here he grabs it and he's gonna fire it deep in the right field

1037
02:04:53,689 --> 02:05:01,409
and it's off the glove of the right fielder and they are rounding second and third one run comes home

1038
02:05:01,409 --> 02:05:10,270
that's three and another three we're tied what I don't even know what to call that he snatched

1039
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:17,550
that right out of thin air hunter sweets literally a circus catches it and launches

1040
02:05:17,550 --> 02:05:24,550
this ball the right center unbelievable play by a hunter sweets that is not

1041
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:29,510
something you see every day and what a risky play to jump out in front of the

1042
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:34,430
plate if you do not grab that cleanly disaster breaks loose in an inning where

1043
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:39,869
all runs count for three enjoy handsome wants to protest this call but he can't

1044
02:05:39,869 --> 02:05:43,470
even find Elbertson with the bag on his head he didn't even see it he's just

1045
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:47,909
being told what happened and he's trying to figure out that the legal player not

1046
02:05:47,909 --> 02:05:53,109
I think I was gonna let it go it's not buying this argument I mean you have to

1047
02:05:53,109 --> 02:05:57,510
you have to come with the sync logical argument and handsome just never got a

1048
02:05:57,510 --> 02:06:02,630
look at that play six runs scored off of the base hit what a time again the

1049
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:06,949
power cards have been played at the exact right time the exact right moment

1050
02:06:06,949 --> 02:06:13,149
they have made a huge impact in this game playing the run card is sweet for

1051
02:06:13,149 --> 02:06:22,180
sweets aren't we all sir aren't we all what a play unbelievable and now the go

1052
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:28,140
ahead three runs standing on second base right for Percy polka dot chance to take

1053
02:06:28,140 --> 02:06:35,159
the lead here for the circus he takes ball one Percy polka dot walked earlier

1054
02:06:35,159 --> 02:06:42,560
in this game starting to turn into the greatest show here it's great to show on

1055
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:51,250
dirt or turf and dirt turf pellets pellets bounce towards third base

1056
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:58,250
charging hard off balance the throw is spiked three more runs will come home this

1057
02:06:58,729 --> 02:07:08,090
circus have the lead a level a nine-run inning on three runs scored has the

1058
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:13,289
circus on top I've been reading the comments and a lot of folks out there

1059
02:07:13,289 --> 02:07:18,649
really didn't think that the circus was gonna go away and sure enough right back

1060
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:24,130
in this thing with the lead Fred Big Top one of the best in the business for a

1061
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:30,569
reason pulls two power cards out of his back pocket the timing just

1062
02:07:30,569 --> 02:07:36,010
scintillating here in the bottom of the fifth a three run lead now for California

1063
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,770
11 to 8 the second baseman for the magicians doing getting a little bit

1064
02:07:40,770 --> 02:07:46,289
more free out of that straight jacket and you know that's that's a frustrating

1065
02:07:46,289 --> 02:07:50,609
situation partner I know you've been hit with that straight jacket a few times in

1066
02:07:50,609 --> 02:07:54,289
your playing days it gets a little claustrophobic by the end of the inning

1067
02:07:54,289 --> 02:07:58,210
it's tough to get off but there is a secret obviously this player doesn't

1068
02:07:58,210 --> 02:08:02,890
know and it's a secret of the pros that we like to call of oh that's a terrible

1069
02:08:02,890 --> 02:08:07,890
throw David Hawk goes down for it golfs it out and that one has been thrown out

1070
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:12,489
of the ballpark I hope there's some insurance on that van over there you may

1071
02:08:12,489 --> 02:08:19,279
have drilled it that was an Aaron throw just took off on the center-center

1072
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:25,079
fielder and he might have an insurance bill coming his way that's that ball

1073
02:08:25,079 --> 02:08:30,359
cleared the entire stance let's see if we get a shot of the card almost hit oh

1074
02:08:30,359 --> 02:08:36,079
oh my gosh what a what a look from our production crew here great camera work

1075
02:08:36,079 --> 02:08:46,090
out there center field Jerma baseball as professional as it gets oh he's trying

1076
02:08:46,090 --> 02:08:53,289
to stay on first base here he's out but trying to oh and oh he's out look at

1077
02:08:53,289 --> 02:08:56,050
him he's got out of the straight jacket just in time to play some defense with

1078
02:08:56,050 --> 02:09:00,090
two outs left and there was some confusion over who's gonna be on first

1079
02:09:00,090 --> 02:09:06,489
base look like that polka dot trying to or was honk excuse me standing up first

1080
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:12,850
base didn't think that they forgot the crew chief Albertson is well in control

1081
02:09:12,890 --> 02:09:17,090
of this game he's letting everyone know also a great job by the second baseman

1082
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:23,449
for the magicians to get out of that straight jacket now he's an integral

1083
02:09:23,449 --> 02:09:28,970
part once again of this defense look at the form from Albertson pure athlete

1084
02:09:28,970 --> 02:09:32,810
makes you wonder how he's not on this field playing right now absolutely could

1085
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:45,409
easily be play for either one of these oh my goodness he got two of them two

1086
02:09:45,409 --> 02:09:51,130
for one fan is not happy picks up his trash and throws it towards Albertson and

1087
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:55,130
exits the game as he's now been thrown out so Albertson has issued a lot of

1088
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:58,810
warnings his first ejection of the game except me excuse me second ejection of

1089
02:09:58,810 --> 02:10:03,770
the game this time a fan that's correct we saw Papa tossed earlier in the game

1090
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:08,369
he did come back out of the dugout in the balloon fight that we saw earlier and

1091
02:10:08,369 --> 02:10:12,890
we want to remind everyone this is all going on with a bag on top of joy

1092
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:16,609
handsome the head coach of the Maryland Magicians set yeah I can't see what's

1093
02:10:16,609 --> 02:10:20,970
happening can't employ any shifts in the defense can't give his pitcher a signal

1094
02:10:20,970 --> 02:10:27,010
all I could do is listen and clap and not only that it here Gary grunt future

1095
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:32,329
Hall of Famer for the Phoenix cavemen you can't make the necessary adjustments

1096
02:10:32,329 --> 02:10:37,649
as vanish pulls the hidden ball trick oh he's got it in his glove what's

1097
02:10:37,649 --> 02:10:47,390
Albertson gonna come it's a strikeout what an illusion for the Magicians now

1098
02:10:47,390 --> 02:10:53,390
you see it now you don't and you're out Victor vanish out of nowhere he gets

1099
02:10:53,430 --> 02:11:01,789
them out of the pickle still a three-run game the california circus Oh big top

1100
02:11:01,789 --> 02:11:07,109
absolutely hates it we'll see what he thinks in the sixth inning we'll be

1101
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:10,869
back after this on JVA

1102
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,779
you

1103
02:14:15,340 --> 02:15:30,500
come back to car shield field this is the German Baseball Association I am

1104
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:36,539
Scott Williamson joined by future Hall of Famer from the cavemen Gary grunt and

1105
02:15:36,539 --> 02:15:41,979
carry a nine run inning for the circus to jump back on top 11 to 8 all started

1106
02:15:42,020 --> 02:15:45,939
with that power card being played meaning that each run that was scored

1107
02:15:45,939 --> 02:15:50,380
would count as three runs and hit three runs across the board so three times

1108
02:15:50,380 --> 02:15:55,659
three is nine they are now in the lead 11 day and how about the big-time play

1109
02:15:55,659 --> 02:16:02,079
that we had behind home plate it was a diving catch made falling into the

1110
02:16:02,079 --> 02:16:09,220
screen by Roy Flushman and or excuse me it was it was made by rather see that

1111
02:16:09,220 --> 02:16:14,739
was Hunter sweets who made that play in in the dugout for the Magicians joy

1112
02:16:14,739 --> 02:16:19,220
handsome had no shot of arguing the call he had a bag over his head he could not

1113
02:16:19,220 --> 02:16:24,420
see anything that was going on trickery going on here now on our screen

1114
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:33,139
bird oh yeah oh and the suck it okay okay all right the double bird suck it

1115
02:16:33,180 --> 02:16:38,540
and now some teepee being flowed on our on the field

1116
02:16:38,540 --> 02:16:47,020
haven't done that oh another one another clown toss didn't like the toll paper on

1117
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:54,309
the field I think that I think he was trying to throw him at the umpires been

1118
02:16:54,309 --> 02:16:58,709
shit tonight so I think that's why I was trying to throw the teepee on the field

1119
02:16:58,709 --> 02:17:09,479
let him know to wipe it up roll in hand you know he was praising the the circus

1120
02:17:09,479 --> 02:17:14,040
earlier for how funny they were with their antics now that it's directed at

1121
02:17:14,040 --> 02:17:18,559
Elbertson he's not so happy about it and you know I hate to bring this up here

1122
02:17:18,559 --> 02:17:23,600
Gary Grunt but is this maybe a little too much ego from Elbertson here yeah we

1123
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:28,200
stand it from time to time where some buttons could be pushed and that's just

1124
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:31,920
the wrong button to push for Albertson and he didn't appreciate the gesture

1125
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:39,219
that he's been shit tonight laffy taffy brings it home it's in there for a call

1126
02:17:39,219 --> 02:17:44,100
strike Albertson you know he spent a long time in that bathroom between innings

1127
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:49,100
and you have to say it's well timed from California you can't be that upset I'm

1128
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:52,059
thinking it was at least a four or five flusher for Albertson because he was in

1129
02:17:52,059 --> 02:17:56,340
there way too long and and let's hope that he dropped in a couple of curtsy

1130
02:17:56,340 --> 02:17:59,940
flushes because we saw his free game meal and that was probably a stinky

1131
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:04,059
stinky poo poo and you know on the year Albertson is is averaging two point

1132
02:18:04,059 --> 02:18:09,860
seven three flushes per dump and if he exceeded that amount you have to say

1133
02:18:09,860 --> 02:18:14,340
that is pretty warranted from California yeah you don't want too many bowel

1134
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:25,920
movements and we'll see how the umpire responds here mr. Albertson pitch comes

1135
02:18:25,959 --> 02:18:32,280
in and it's a ball low and outside this is Mike Salmon at the plate we saw him

1136
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:38,139
back his way over to first base for a single and runner off with the pitch it

1137
02:18:38,139 --> 02:18:43,420
is fouled out of play to the right side so a stolen base attempt make sure that

1138
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:50,739

1142
02:19:10,170 --> 02:19:15,370
as well to count to two and one nobody out and one man on or the magicians here

1143
02:19:15,370 --> 02:19:19,329
in the top of the sixth let's see what kind of response the magicians have here

1144
02:19:19,329 --> 02:19:26,059
is trailing by three now after that big inning runner on the move again the

1145
02:19:26,459 --> 02:19:42,540
fifth don't have to send him right back to first base bedazzle Mike Salmon five

1146
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:51,500
foot ten hundred ninety pounds a 291 hitter including that base hit today the

1147
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:56,340
two-two pitch put on the ground towards short this could be two to second base

1148
02:19:56,340 --> 02:20:01,420
for one laughington turns around one hopper to first and just not quite in

1149
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:08,299
time as thought about so yeah out and safe out at second base safe at first

1150
02:20:08,299 --> 02:20:12,739
base the official call from Albert sentence trying to regain control is

1151
02:20:12,739 --> 02:20:18,120
well is he trying to dry his you know a little swamp ass in the behind the plate

1152
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:23,520
right now and you know we talked about that being you know one of your signature

1153
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:29,479
moves the swamp this can be really a game-changer and the magicians are at

1154
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:39,200
again oh my gosh endless amounts of Kleenex I mean that's Donnie strange

1155
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:44,079
they might want to say that I give it to mr. or umpire Albertson that maybe soak

1156
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:47,879
up some of that swamp ass he's got rocking hunter sweets is feeling a

1157
02:20:47,879 --> 02:20:56,500
little sour after that so now strange will step in and try to come up with a

1158
02:20:56,500 --> 02:21:04,540
hit one out in the end it's all strange and BP taking some big hacks he's

1159
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:08,299
swung and miss it around five in a row and make some contact here so we were

1160
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:13,899
wondering what kind of adjustments strange would make he did not look good

1161
02:21:13,899 --> 02:21:20,760
and BP made contact there certainly an integral part for the magicians and

1162
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:26,600
worked there by the ball clown the ball clown really for my money he has been

1163
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:31,319
the best execution of anyone tonight yeah time and time again he comes up

1164
02:21:31,319 --> 02:21:35,399
same form exactly I was just gonna say he's not afraid to take that extra step

1165
02:21:35,399 --> 02:21:38,959
make sure he's in the right position to hand the balls to Albertson yeah it does

1166
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:43,280
a nice job of getting to Albertson to dug out oh nearly took his head off taffy

1167
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:51,350
ducking for cover and that would have been a colorful experience had that come

1168
02:21:51,350 --> 02:22:00,209
to fruition another look strange just rips the cover off that ball and taffy

1169
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:10,639
do nothing but duck out of the way big chance here for the magicians to get

1170
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:14,120
back in this all they need is a three run shot I have to wonder if they I

1171
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:17,200
don't know how many power cards have been played for them as it's one spring

1172
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:24,200
in the way just inside the line of fair ball one run coming home here comes the

1173
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:29,440
second getting the wave around third headed towards third base himself Xavier

1174
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:34,799
make magic and as he chugs the beer he's coming home he sucks the can at the

1175
02:22:34,799 --> 02:22:43,040
catcher and scores and dabs what a spray chart this guy has knocks it down the

1176
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:48,719
left field wall three runs scored and we are tied 11 11 of the top of the six

1177
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:55,360
what a great job of hitting right here going oppo field check that spray chart

1178
02:22:55,360 --> 02:23:03,680
that was done that hooked him up and we know old dougie has had his way with the

1179
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,879
elixir throughout this game he knew exactly what make magic needed that

1180
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:12,280
extra oomph to get him across home plate we are all tied he did that feel good

1181
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:17,040
juice and they've been anytime that something specials happen for the

1182
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:21,670
magicians that feel good juice has been a part of it to hopper to third no

1183
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:27,430
problem over there for giggles and Sean put it in the dirt tag is applied and

1184
02:23:27,430 --> 02:23:37,430
German with the emphatic call for chief Albertson now we can see handsome can

1185
02:23:37,430 --> 02:23:44,299
see now and doing the the swan the swan move the figure skating swan move as

1186
02:23:44,299 --> 02:23:48,459
he's trying to tell him that he swan dive this see the initial play here is

1187
02:23:48,459 --> 02:23:53,899
bobbled but a great recovery and right there the tag is applied and you can see

1188
02:23:53,899 --> 02:23:58,139
the ball we're going to move down that line by the runner trying to evade the

1189
02:23:58,139 --> 02:24:04,139
tag or the tag and just couldn't and that is the kind of call that ends up

1190
02:24:04,139 --> 02:24:09,659
getting crew chief Albertson into the championship game to be the the crew

1191
02:24:09,659 --> 02:24:15,899
chief time and time again just a big big play he's all over all over it good call

1192
02:24:15,899 --> 02:24:24,379
by Albertson Dumbledore really hates it but look at that just loading on the

1193
02:24:24,379 --> 02:24:35,819
other side and this one's stung past the shortstop a tough hop Roy Fluschman

1194
02:24:35,819 --> 02:24:43,829
caught it flush been a lot of flushes here tonight between the bathroom and

1195
02:24:43,829 --> 02:24:49,469
flushman there really have and that's another thing that we've got to really

1196
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:55,870
take into account here are these restrooms still usable by the ninth

1197
02:24:55,870 --> 02:25:00,149
inning we're just hoping for our fans sake that we can get through this one

1198
02:25:00,149 --> 02:25:05,989
yeah maybe get a plumber in here to pipe the you know what right out of this

1199
02:25:05,989 --> 02:25:10,709
field well we know Roy's a little bit busy but we'll see if he can get some

1200
02:25:10,709 --> 02:25:16,450
some help for us out here first pitch to mystery and he puts it through the hole

1201
02:25:16,450 --> 02:25:20,940
between first and second two outs in the inning and two runners now for the

1202
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:24,139
Magicians that mystery is taking some good at bats here extends the inning for

1203
02:25:24,139 --> 02:25:27,739

1204
02:25:27,739 --> 02:25:32,579
this game the circus came back with nine runs in the fifth inning and a good

1205
02:25:32,579 --> 02:25:35,700
response here by the Magicians already putting up three they have two on with

1206
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:43,569

1220
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:30,129
league so it'll be Victor vanished back to the mound he was outstanding in that

1221
02:28:30,129 --> 02:28:33,930
last half inning of work despite the nine runs being put up on the board

1222
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:37,610
because of a power card and now we've got another yep the upgrade it's a rare

1223
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:41,290
card being played right now by the Magicians it replaced bats with a much

1224
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:45,489
larger bat with more service area for this half inning so it's more of a club

1225
02:28:45,489 --> 02:28:52,090
that they'll be using a caveman club and Gary you might have I had the inside

1226
02:28:52,090 --> 02:28:56,209
info on how to use this correct as with my favorite bat to use when I was

1227
02:28:56,209 --> 02:29:02,489
playing for the caveman it's the obviously thick bat I used to call mine

1228
02:29:02,489 --> 02:29:07,209
the Fred Flintstone because it was just made of bedrock and could really put

1229
02:29:07,209 --> 02:29:10,170
some power behind the ball and that's where I why I hit a lot of home runs

1230
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:17,170
over my career playing for the caveman so they were implemented that bat cup

1231
02:29:17,170 --> 02:29:20,409
check here to make sure it works I don't think actually he's wearing a cup he's

1232
02:29:20,409 --> 02:29:24,370
just beating himself with balls right now and you know what sometimes you get

1233
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:28,229
to the bottom of the sixth inning and you need a good shot between the legs to

1234
02:29:28,229 --> 02:29:31,850
wake you up the pace of play has slowed a little bit with all the scoring that

1235
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:36,309
we've had here lately and a nice shot to the nuts wake you up right away as we

1236
02:29:36,350 --> 02:29:40,510
have number 69 Manny Upchuck coming to the plate and we talked about so much

1237
02:29:40,510 --> 02:29:45,190
when you use this club the hair to bat ratio has to be correct and it looks

1238
02:29:45,190 --> 02:29:51,850
pretty good here first pitch swinging throw up the line was the tag applied

1239
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:58,870
yes what a defensive play the club does not pull through there for the circus

1240
02:29:58,870 --> 02:30:06,149
oh the comedy live motion for the swipe just like in his playing days

1241
02:30:06,149 --> 02:30:12,450
Elbertson like it was yesterday yeah yeah former first baseman turned umpire

1242
02:30:12,450 --> 02:30:17,370
used to call him scoops of the field while the deer and now they're scooping

1243
02:30:17,370 --> 02:30:22,370
something else up back in the bathroom after the debacle that we had a while

1244
02:30:22,370 --> 02:30:26,770
ago again we apologize to you fans that's just something we can't control

1245
02:30:26,770 --> 02:30:31,370
you know and it's one of those things it'll catch up to Elbertson what maybe

1246
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:36,610
once every five games or so and he just needs that extended time in between

1247
02:30:36,610 --> 02:30:39,969
innings so forgot to take the money made he's got a little runs his jeans right

1248
02:30:39,969 --> 02:30:44,690
now so that's right so now Harry helium oh man he's feeling so there's a juice

1249
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:51,420
and feel good juice oh boy vanish here we go what kind of illusion are we gonna

1250
02:30:51,420 --> 02:31:00,379
see a two swagger look out and behind inside g-double-o-d-e-y-e-o Torkin oh

1251
02:31:00,379 --> 02:31:06,459
there's the beer man beer man and the booty yeah now he's the hot dog man out

1252
02:31:06,459 --> 02:31:10,100
on the field showing bunt I don't know if you want to bump oh and he takes a

1253
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:16,260
strike nasty slider there from vanish oh Elbertson thought about running over to

1254
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:18,340
the magician's bench I guess we're still chirping there

1255
02:31:18,340 --> 02:31:26,219
yeah of his mind and meanwhile vanish is just hammering this beer on the mount

1256
02:31:26,219 --> 02:31:30,700
beer man's got them all ready for the next inning that one comes in letter

1257
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:33,940
high call strike I was that the homeless guy is the beer guy the homeless guy

1258
02:31:33,940 --> 02:31:36,659
from happy Gilmore because that's what it looks like and you know what that

1259
02:31:36,659 --> 02:31:41,899
that homeless guy needs some more love because he has provided so many of

1260
02:31:41,899 --> 02:31:47,700
these magicians with the tools necessary those tools being that magic elixir

1261
02:31:47,739 --> 02:31:52,819
magic elixir it's working now as the count is back in the favor of vanish it's

1262
02:31:52,819 --> 02:31:58,899
one and two could use a strikeout here highlight kick the fish the helium and

1263
02:31:58,899 --> 02:32:03,780
it caught him in the front thigh whoa well the ball yes they said it didn't

1264
02:32:03,780 --> 02:32:07,700
hit it didn't look at this it did look no argument from helium he wants to use

1265
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:15,219
this club yeah it looked like he was gonna trot down first base but he

1266
02:32:15,219 --> 02:32:20,540
avoided the pitch just barely I thought maybe he got his pants but Elbertson

1267
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:24,940
says no ran it in on him and you could hear the loud crack of the bat chucks

1268
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:29,620
it in vanish and look at this he's gonna get a word from helium oh he tosses him

1269
02:32:29,620 --> 02:32:38,100
from the game just just when you thought you had some sportsmanship vanish

1270
02:32:38,100 --> 02:32:41,940
vanishes from the handshake yeah he went in there for the handshake say it's all

1271
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:47,950
good psych see ya did the hair slick back oh and you wonder if this is Harry

1272
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:53,309
helium again he has really been trying to coax some of these magicians to join

1273
02:32:53,309 --> 02:32:57,989
the circus and upcoming helium has been tossed from this game oh my gosh he has

1274
02:32:57,989 --> 02:33:02,190
seen he has been good guy helium throughout this contest and he's been

1275
02:33:02,190 --> 02:33:12,030
high as a kite now he's at the lowest close throwing out of this game oh look

1276
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:18,469
at this oh push up off okay and as a former player Gary grunt how do you

1277
02:33:18,469 --> 02:33:22,750
break that for not sure of the form there the pump was a little too low for

1278
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:26,030
my like and look at this Elbertson and try again he's got to do it again yeah

1279
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:29,909
look at this we got too much booty action in the back yeah it's like a big

1280
02:33:29,909 --> 02:33:35,209
castle but it's not low enough no there we go that's a little bit is accepting

1281
02:33:35,209 --> 02:33:42,149
these back in okay he did get the necessary amount of push-ups okay he's

1282
02:33:42,149 --> 02:33:47,950
back in so helium is high once again and you know what not

1283
02:33:47,989 --> 02:33:53,190
everyone can manage ten push-ups at a time especially if you're high the way

1284
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:58,629
that Harry helium is right now that would have been a big loss for the circus

1285
02:33:58,629 --> 02:34:04,149
if helium left this game but thankfully he's able to keep his cardio up treats

1286
02:34:04,149 --> 02:34:08,469
the body right and not only that his good nature will will continue throughout

1287
02:34:08,469 --> 02:34:11,709
this game it appears that that our shortstop has gotten enough of this

1288
02:34:11,709 --> 02:34:16,790
elixir in his energy is spread into the outfield there are no shirts on for half

1289
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:21,190
of our defense right now for the magic yeah it's a it's a warm night it's cooled

1290
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:24,510
off just a little bit but you know with all the drinking that the magicians have

1291
02:34:24,510 --> 02:34:29,879
been doing it can't get a little sweaty out there so nice little dance there

1292
02:34:29,879 --> 02:34:36,040
from the shortstop yeah we got we got some you know when the shirts come off

1293
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:42,559
you've got to give the female audience something to really write home about you

1294
02:34:42,559 --> 02:34:45,520
got to give him a reason to tune in again one of the reasons why the JVA

1295
02:34:45,559 --> 02:34:50,799
does it better than anyone that's a fair ball down the line takes a weird bounce

1296
02:34:50,799 --> 02:34:55,040
off the wall this is Lenny Munson headed into second base with a stand-up

1297
02:34:55,040 --> 02:35:02,120
two-out double Munson with a great hit nice double down that left field side of

1298
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:06,559
course all players are using the club here the bat best known for from the

1299
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:14,440
caveman someone got a hold of them and you know what that's celebratory clown

1300
02:35:14,479 --> 02:35:18,719
music that starts going can be a bit unnerving for the opponents that's when

1301
02:35:18,719 --> 02:35:26,010
California starts to feel it securities digging it and we're equal opportunity

1302
02:35:26,010 --> 02:35:34,299
beer man a beer man here and we can't forget that you know shirts off can go

1303
02:35:34,299 --> 02:35:41,770
both ways so wild pitch allows the runner to advance from second to third

1304
02:35:41,770 --> 02:35:50,629
and that's something else to keep in mind here we saw that hot start for the

1305
02:35:50,670 --> 02:35:55,430
Maryland magicians and that elixir you know it brings you a good boost initially

1306
02:35:55,430 --> 02:36:00,469
do they start to lose it as this game goes along as that elixir takes more

1307
02:36:00,469 --> 02:36:03,350
effect I think that's why you just keep drinking it you know the more elixir you

1308
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:09,510
take the better you get you know the more elixir you have within your system

1309
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:13,350
the more chance you're gonna be able to put up some runs put up some big time

1310
02:36:13,350 --> 02:36:17,629
hits and Gary correct me if I'm wrong but it's the decision-making that that

1311
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:21,190
elixir you know if you don't have enough of it you can't make the right decisions

1312
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:25,270
out there as we see a bunt attempt push foul at the first base side count to one

1313
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:33,149
and two says Paul Laffington at the plate hitting 308 now on the year I did

1314
02:36:33,149 --> 02:36:38,750
notice that some of those shots the the cleanliness and the smoothness of the

1315
02:36:38,750 --> 02:36:41,829
bodies as you see there no hair whatsoever those guys would not make

1316
02:36:41,829 --> 02:36:46,750
the caveman no they wouldn't and that's why you see them here on the their

1317
02:36:47,229 --> 02:36:55,909
they are manscaped not the only thing that razor went to work on as this is

1318
02:36:55,909 --> 02:37:00,350
bounced back in front of the plate vanish underhand flips to the bag at

1319
02:37:00,350 --> 02:37:06,350
first force out and tag applied for the end of the inning we go to the seventh

1320
02:37:06,350 --> 02:37:12,229
we're all tied at 11 we'll be right back with more germa baseball association

1321
02:41:03,959 --> 02:41:05,959
oh

1322
02:41:12,959 --> 02:41:29,809
switch yourself up with a fuck you turn me off I know it's just a figure of speech

1323
02:41:29,809 --> 02:41:36,600
but don't you know how to feel just as hard as tattooing when it's this one's

1324
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:56,459
burning up my skin inside of my heart till the end of time I'll be fire fire

1325
02:41:56,459 --> 02:42:00,809
cuz you're my human life

1326
02:42:00,809 --> 02:42:46,280
welcome back to car shield field where we are tied at 11 we got a baseball game

1327
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:50,840
going on between the lines but meanwhile in the dugout a fight has broken loose

1328
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:54,959
yeah back in the locker room right now the mascots have been going at it for

1329
02:42:54,959 --> 02:42:59,959
quite some time it's like a WWE battle is broken out oh chair right to the nuts

1330
02:42:59,959 --> 02:43:06,559
ouch excuse me a trash can to the nuts that's never good no doubt about it and

1331
02:43:06,559 --> 02:43:10,719
you know that I wouldn't wish a trash can to the nuts on anybody and not only

1332
02:43:10,719 --> 02:43:14,680
that that's again one of those momentum changes in this game you know that your

1333
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:18,280
mascot has just been blown to smithereens down in the dugout that

1334
02:43:18,280 --> 02:43:23,760
that's a big shot to the spirit of your squad look at that laughy taffy as he

1335
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,120
comes out with the pitch and we got a couple of clowns right behind old plate

1336
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:32,520
yeah the ball clowns are on the field trying to create havoc one just sitting

1337
02:43:32,520 --> 02:43:36,000
enjoying some peanuts and crackerjacks yeah he's got his crackerjacks out there

1338
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,920
this is the backup ball clown is playing over there's a crackerjack ball clown

1339
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:47,120
oh it looks like cheese it's not sure if those are extra crunchy or not but look

1340
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:51,120
like some cheese it's being had there there's outstanding stuff one of the

1341
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:55,200
best snacks in the snack universe he leans into that one and Albertsons all

1342
02:43:55,200 --> 02:44:02,139
over it look at this oh no is he going he is going to award him first base

1343
02:44:02,139 --> 02:44:11,290
sweets is giving his argument from behind home plate look at this taffy's

1344
02:44:11,290 --> 02:44:15,010
coming at him taffy's trying to get that out but they never want to see a player

1345
02:44:15,010 --> 02:44:19,809
go after the referee and if we let taffy know how many times the Albertsons been

1346
02:44:19,809 --> 02:44:25,569
running to the bathroom he may not want to get too close yeah exactly you end up

1347
02:44:25,569 --> 02:44:32,930
tackling that man and you could get back to your feet with all kinds of mess and

1348
02:44:32,930 --> 02:44:37,290
we got another player thrown out look at this two of them are we gonna have

1349
02:44:37,290 --> 02:44:41,010
enough players for the clown or the circus they are running finishes game

1350
02:44:41,010 --> 02:44:45,889
they are running very thin at this point I believe right now they are at the

1351
02:44:45,889 --> 02:44:53,610
minimum for active players it is a total of meditation going on ten players

1352
02:44:53,610 --> 02:45:02,489
right now for the circus someone is trying to realign his center and find

1353
02:45:02,489 --> 02:45:08,129
his cheek Fred circus Fred circus has come out of the pen there's the right

1354
02:45:08,129 --> 02:45:14,659
fielder just standing up all that's good balance there not only good balance we

1355
02:45:14,659 --> 02:45:17,540
talked about you know some of the outfielders for the magicians not

1356
02:45:17,540 --> 02:45:22,700
staying engaged kind of taking a nap out there especially on left field you're

1357
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:27,059
balancing on that box who ball you have no choice another player the ball one

1358
02:45:27,059 --> 02:45:30,620
of the ball clowns one of the three ball clowns he took the cheese it's cheese it

1359
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:33,700
look out he's got that hey those are white cheddar cheese it's taken easy put

1360
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:40,120
those in my red my second place so the ball clown has been tossed wait a second

1361
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:45,280
is is that your salary for this game was supposed to be a box of white cheddar

1362
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:48,680
cheese it is that the box supposed to be one of the parting gifts absolutely I

1370
02:46:28,569 --> 02:46:34,500
baseman really well done that's David Honk who has shifted over to second

1371
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:42,299
base he started this game out in center field it shows the diversity for the

1372
02:46:42,299 --> 02:46:49,090
circus first pitch comes high and inside off and stealing second base it is a

1373
02:46:49,090 --> 02:46:56,409
stolen base out there for the magicians and a reminder that if you want both

1382
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:47,649
of content that this man is going to have on his page is unmatched as he

1383
02:47:47,649 --> 02:47:52,729
slides in safely in the securities chasing after him and he just cannot get

1384
02:47:52,729 --> 02:47:57,569
anywhere near him look at it look at the speed from this streaker security he's

1385
02:47:57,569 --> 02:48:00,049
got to get in the gym yeah it's something written on his chest and

1386
02:48:00,049 --> 02:48:05,870
something about fans Lee so obviously a big fan wanting people to come to his

1387
02:48:05,870 --> 02:48:10,030
page to see his content he's in the dugout right now we'll see if he makes

1388
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:17,959
another appearance is that being told by the booth at dump truck Danny a dump

1389
02:48:17,959 --> 02:48:21,200
truck Danny sighting you heard that right folks

1390
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:29,059
dump truck Danny is in the house doesn't get any better than this all tied late

1391
02:48:29,059 --> 02:48:32,819
innings little flair shout out to right field hopping off the basu ball little

1392
02:48:32,819 --> 02:48:37,139
late break on it as he was trying to keep his balance before it got to him

1393
02:48:37,139 --> 02:48:42,139
one run comes home the magicians are back on top throw in the third base

1394
02:48:42,139 --> 02:48:49,700
there is no throw as they mishandled it how about that Maryland back on top

1395
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:55,940
dump truck Danny getting a little spark for the magicians as they retake the

1396
02:48:55,940 --> 02:49:01,920
lead here in the top half of the seventh inning to be the bottom you know that

1397
02:49:01,959 --> 02:49:10,639
puts Fred circus on the hook now in this game circus comes into this game two

1398
02:49:10,639 --> 02:49:18,059
wins no losses but he has picked up two tie decisions on the year yeah a rare

1399
02:49:18,059 --> 02:49:25,260
occasion you'll see a tie in this game but it happens this this is don't adjust

1400
02:49:25,260 --> 02:49:28,739
your screen it's not reloading your twitch feed is not reloading that was

1401
02:49:28,780 --> 02:49:43,450
a strategy from the circus pitcher Fred outside two and one a swarm of beases

1402
02:49:43,450 --> 02:49:48,819
around the field I get a look at it now it's just the that drone we saw earlier

1403
02:49:48,819 --> 02:49:54,209
just been getting shots from above the park and base hit up the middle infield

1404
02:49:54,209 --> 02:49:59,370
pulled in with one out in the runner at third leaves a wide open hole up the

1405
02:49:59,370 --> 02:50:06,510
middle for Donald strange and he exploits it 13 to 12 Maryland on top of

1406
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:13,430
California a good piece of hitting there help back up still going at it in the

1407
02:50:13,430 --> 02:50:17,389
locker room or the mascots look like another it's in a circle race fighting

1408
02:50:17,389 --> 02:50:23,709
it stopped over the chair over the training table a move just wearing them

1409
02:50:23,709 --> 02:50:31,270
out that is well done so that fight continues to twist and turn we'll keep

1410
02:50:31,270 --> 02:50:35,549
you updated what's going on down in the dugout talk about a royal rumble that

1411
02:50:35,549 --> 02:50:39,030
thing has been going on for quite some time and you know it's it's one of those

1412
02:50:39,030 --> 02:50:43,989
two when these two teams get together to watch those two mascots not only it's

1413
02:50:43,989 --> 02:50:48,350
all part of it you know the reason why these teams are one of the best in the

1414
02:50:48,350 --> 02:50:52,629
league is because of those mascots they have done their fair share of just

1415
02:50:52,629 --> 02:50:56,469
molly whopping opposing mascots all year long great matchup and the

1416
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:59,629
streaker has made another appearance streaker's back oh look at him he's

1417
02:50:59,629 --> 02:51:04,629
haunting oh my goodness he's pulling those he's pulling Twix right out of his

1418
02:51:04,629 --> 02:51:10,670
package and chucking them at the security guard oh my goodness that's

1419
02:51:10,670 --> 02:51:15,510
even better ground ball to second base meanwhile the streaker backpedaling in

1420
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:20,549
left field as the out is recorded for the second of the inning dump truck

1421
02:51:20,549 --> 02:51:25,670
Danny reading havoc out there I think this is just gonna have to happen as

1422
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:29,790
the players continue to play here and dump truck Danny out left field still

1423
02:51:29,790 --> 02:51:35,270
having a good time I mean he is just baiting security out there look at this

1424
02:51:35,270 --> 02:51:46,110
free him three free dump truck Danny the fans have made their voices heard look

1425
02:51:46,110 --> 02:51:49,190
at this Albertson wants him off this field but I don't think it's gonna

1426
02:51:49,190 --> 02:51:54,469
happen a fans Lee all-star I mean you you just cannot say enough about this

1427
02:51:54,469 --> 02:51:59,190
guy that page has got to be just on fire tonight it's reminds me with this golden

1428
02:51:59,190 --> 02:52:01,909
thong if you remember a great baseball hitter in the major league baseball

1429
02:52:01,909 --> 02:52:07,709
named by Jason Giambi and whenever he would get into a slump or a teammate

1430
02:52:07,709 --> 02:52:12,350
would get into a slump they put on a golden underwear golden thong that's

1431
02:52:12,350 --> 02:52:16,670
very much like what dump truck Danny's wearing out there right now blast into

1432
02:52:16,670 --> 02:52:22,270
deep left field unicycling towards it he can't make it in time it one hops the

1433
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:26,709
wall and the magicians have tacked on a third in this inning he turns on the

1434
02:52:26,709 --> 02:52:32,729
Jets thinking three and Martin majestic coming off the bench with a pinch hit

1435
02:52:32,729 --> 02:52:37,229
RBI triple what a majestic slide into third base we'll get another look at

1436
02:52:37,229 --> 02:52:42,030
this is roped into left field the streaker right now paying dividends for

1437
02:52:42,030 --> 02:52:46,430
the magicians as it really has the circus caught off guard here and it has

1438
02:52:46,430 --> 02:52:51,590
to be it really has to do with that golden underwear that's just flailing

1439
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:58,629
around right off the fans Lee side and it's another hit by pitch this time

1440
02:52:58,629 --> 02:53:02,950
getting hit Albertson just beside itself can't believe it that another pitcher

1441
02:53:02,950 --> 02:53:08,430
would hit a batter here he's awarding for space now takes a look over into the

1442
02:53:08,430 --> 02:53:13,030
circus dugout you've been flushman and you know what he's probably gonna have a

1443
02:53:13,030 --> 02:53:17,590
sore ass tomorrow too yeah yeah we lost our asses out there between drunk drunk

1444
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:21,950
dump truck Danny and these players getting rear-ended in the ass these

1445
02:53:21,950 --> 02:53:29,940
pitches this is escalating rather quickly and golden underwear guys

1446
02:53:29,940 --> 02:53:35,360
wearing it in the rear end coach Hanson went over to talk about why how come

1447
02:53:35,360 --> 02:53:39,200
nobody has been thrown out yet especially with all the umpteenth time

1448
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:42,120
that these teams have been warned about hitting somebody and I believe the

1449
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:45,600
response was they have no other players they can't throw anybody else out

1450
02:53:45,600 --> 02:54:03,989
Albertson once talked to the shortstop once to make sure everyone's on the same

1451
02:54:03,989 --> 02:54:14,120
page he's threatening to throw out again Harry helium Albertson doesn't want to

1452
02:54:14,120 --> 02:54:23,250
talk back it's an ump show now nice things to say all game long what's

1453
02:54:23,250 --> 02:54:35,290
going on back here oh they're they're wanting to know about the mascot fight

1454
02:54:35,290 --> 02:54:39,370
we've been showing you highlights throughout it's a royal rumble I'm not

1455
02:54:39,370 --> 02:54:43,950
quite sure which locker room but the Dumbledore mascot and the Dopey the

1456
02:54:43,950 --> 02:54:54,270
clown I've been going at it and Albertson is back again Dopey Oh to the

1457
02:54:54,270 --> 02:55:00,559
face oh my goodness I think if whoever wins this battle gets a run tacked on

1458
02:55:00,559 --> 02:55:10,120
to their trying to steal home they get them oh my goodness utter craziness

1459
02:55:10,120 --> 02:55:17,079
happening on both fronts oh my gosh look at this out with an argument here comes

1460
02:55:17,079 --> 02:55:22,399
joy handsome again he is so handsome he can't help but argue with a huge smile I

1461
02:55:22,399 --> 02:55:26,520
don't believe what I just saw in the locker room and on the field a steal of

1462
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:32,000
home plate you don't see it too often what a play and good work by the circus

1463
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:39,920
mascot here we go Dumbledore could be out that's a run that is a run for the circus so attack one

1464
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:44,500
we'll talk to the score where people tack one on for the circus and that is

1465
02:55:44,500 --> 02:57:38,059
pulled back within two we'll be right back on JBA welcome back to car shield

1466
02:57:38,059 --> 02:57:44,420
field as you see germination out in droves here to take in this contest

1467
02:57:44,420 --> 02:57:48,620
between the Maryland magicians and the California circus that big nine run

1468
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:53,100
inning in the fifth momentarily put the circus on top but the magicians have

1469
02:57:53,100 --> 02:57:59,260
answered back a back-and-forth grinder of a game and the pin gets California

1470
02:57:59,260 --> 02:58:03,739
another run so they're back within two after that mascot duel down in the

1471
02:58:03,739 --> 02:58:10,940
dugout yeah the battle of mascots the win goes to the circus so and now we've

1472
02:58:10,940 --> 02:58:14,620
got the streaker in a yoga session right now with some of the players getting

1473
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:18,459
them stretched out this is the seventh inning stretch so it completely makes

1474
02:58:18,459 --> 02:58:24,139
sense that dump truck Danny would lead the some of the squad members in some

1475
02:58:24,139 --> 02:58:31,059
Pilates type yoga and you don't get a dump truck like Danny has for no reason

1476
02:58:31,059 --> 02:58:36,299
he is taking the clowns through his routine and look out for some of these

1477
02:58:36,299 --> 02:58:41,500
circus members on fans Lee after the game they will have certainly learned a

1478
02:58:41,500 --> 02:58:46,579
thing or two from dump truck and dump truck one of the finer instructors in

1479
02:58:46,620 --> 02:58:58,219
the country and you got to look out to you know I understand that that our crew

1480
02:58:58,219 --> 02:59:01,979
chief Elbertson might not be appreciating this but you never know how

1481
02:59:01,979 --> 02:59:07,299
many extra hot dogs are our guide dump truck Danny has hidden down in that

1482
02:59:07,299 --> 02:59:12,620
package yeah there's a look like too many maybe one medium-sized one but

1483
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:16,940
we'll see you never quite know it hasn't been fully cooked yet still that's that's

1484
02:59:17,379 --> 02:59:21,260
made no one wants to know how the hot dogs made this one eat it you know the

1485
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:27,219
raw dog does have a different volume you know it's we won't get into it it's it's

1486
02:59:27,219 --> 02:59:33,940
the Maryland magicians of 14 to 12 over the California circus we're trying to

1487
02:59:33,940 --> 02:59:39,559
play ball here so we don't have enough players for California I don't know the

1488
02:59:39,559 --> 02:59:44,100
rulebook but you were talking about get the magicians led right now send

1489
02:59:44,100 --> 02:59:49,180
somebody on loan as they do in European soccer loan a player to the circus see

1490
02:59:49,180 --> 02:59:56,459
what happens here kind of this is a tough situation I'm not sure what the

1491
02:59:56,459 --> 03:00:04,420
solution and Elbertson has a bat in his hands right now no no umpires about to

1492
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:13,819
enter this game for California okay this is you know we've seen over the course of

1493
03:00:13,819 --> 03:00:20,100
this year but this is this might be a step far look at this now this is this

1494
03:00:20,100 --> 03:00:23,659
is true dedication to the league you know they don't have enough players he

1495
03:00:23,659 --> 03:00:28,899
says the show must go on I'm digging up some stats you know the JBA does a good

1496
03:00:28,899 --> 03:00:33,059
job of keeping random stats this is actually Elbertson's third at bat in his

1497
03:00:33,059 --> 03:00:37,100
career as an umpire so not unheard of that he's done this before he's over to

1498
03:00:37,100 --> 03:00:41,180
in his career let's see what he gets his first hit he bats from the right side

1499
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:45,260
slightly open stance first pitch tried to frame it up and he calls it high

1500
03:00:45,260 --> 03:00:49,620
calls it you know that looked to be just underneath the letters for a call

1501
03:00:49,620 --> 03:00:56,260
striking Elbertson hey surprise surprise it's ball one ball one of course as

1502
03:00:56,260 --> 03:01:06,649
Albert to in the player at bat pinch hitting for the circus you know he

1503
03:01:06,649 --> 03:01:12,329
called another ball Elbertson may only have three at bats as an umpire but

1504
03:01:12,329 --> 03:01:18,969
he's hitting 238 so as good as the stats that they keep here for for the JBA the

1505
03:01:18,969 --> 03:01:22,409
math may be a little bit off look at this he's pulled it down the line it's

1506
03:01:22,409 --> 03:01:28,409
fair Albertson speeding past first he's thinking to throw comes in the second

1507
03:01:28,409 --> 03:01:34,049
oh he takes a quick turnaround in a good decision by crew chief Albertson he

1508
03:01:34,049 --> 03:01:38,370
rules himself safe at first now you gotta wonder if he's gonna call ball

1509
03:01:38,409 --> 03:01:42,690
strikes in the first base but a trickler down the left side found an open hole

1510
03:01:42,690 --> 03:01:48,170
pass the diving third baseman and into the outfield thankfully the left dealer

1511
03:01:48,170 --> 03:01:57,950
good you can see the wheels there good stop and track back there not sure if

1512
03:01:57,950 --> 03:02:01,790
he knows what to do with his hands quite when he's right I love the technique

1513
03:02:01,790 --> 03:02:05,870
it's like he's getting mad at the air he's karate chopping the air as he goes

1514
03:02:05,870 --> 03:02:10,549
around and it just fires you up so the up is on first base and he's calling

1515
03:02:10,549 --> 03:02:15,309
balls and strikes in there well he has a little bit better view from over there

1516
03:02:15,309 --> 03:02:18,790
is something that he told me I actually caught up with crew chief Albertson

1517
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:22,750
before this game and you know I raised that question as we get another look at

1518
03:02:22,750 --> 03:02:27,430
dump truck Danny he's hanging out with with joy handsome and wonder if Joy's

1519
03:02:27,430 --> 03:02:32,149
rubbing off on him a little bit that'll up that that fans Lee page content even

1520
03:02:32,149 --> 03:02:37,069
more I gotta tell you dumpster Danny's double-dipping he's going he's seducing

1521
03:02:37,069 --> 03:02:43,069
the circus bench with hot yoga and now he's over in the magicians bench there

1522
03:02:43,069 --> 03:02:47,190
you see right there in the dugout there's dump truck Danny well you know

1523
03:02:47,190 --> 03:02:53,469
the ball found the ball players have been known to not be able to turn down a

1524
03:02:53,469 --> 03:02:57,790
dump truck easily and when a guy like Danny walks into your life it's just

1525
03:02:57,790 --> 03:03:03,190
hard to say no it's hard to say no and you know and he's doing it for a good

1526
03:03:03,190 --> 03:03:12,059
cause we got to free the ball handler outside bring one count here and not

1527
03:03:12,059 --> 03:03:17,139
only that fondling abilities really translates well to this game and we'll

1528
03:03:17,139 --> 03:03:21,860
see if you know he can give a few fondling lessons down in the dugout yeah

1529
03:03:21,860 --> 03:03:27,180
you really want to you know make sure to tickle it just a little bit look at it

1530
03:03:27,180 --> 03:03:32,340
look at the showboating down to second base and you know Albertson he wouldn't

1531
03:03:32,340 --> 03:03:35,940
have none of this from one of the players in the game yet here he goes

1532
03:03:35,940 --> 03:03:42,219
himself showboating on a walk down to second base I mean come on come on yeah

1533
03:03:42,219 --> 03:03:46,860
that's not something Albertson tolerates when he's behind the plate but now that

1534
03:03:46,860 --> 03:03:51,459
he's thrust into a position player role he has to play both roles now has to

1535
03:03:51,459 --> 03:03:56,700
play umpire crew chief and try score a run here for the California circus yeah

1536
03:03:56,700 --> 03:03:59,940
that may get lost in all of this we got a two run ballgame in the bottom of the

1537
03:03:59,940 --> 03:04:04,940
seventh inning these are crunch crunch time moments and don't forget to tune

1538
03:04:04,940 --> 03:04:08,659
into crunch time after this game that's our postgame show we'll get you updates

1539
03:04:08,659 --> 03:04:12,579
from other scores around the league and highlights and maybe even unpack a

1540
03:04:12,579 --> 03:04:16,540
little bit more of some of the craziness that's going on in this one yeah plenty

1541
03:04:16,540 --> 03:04:20,780
games around the league here tonight well I've crunched on the postgame it's

1542
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:25,899
Tom chair but it's Dickie direct well have your highlights from all across the

1543
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:32,139
league here in the JBA Victor vanish with the pitch to Percy polka dot and the

1544
03:04:32,139 --> 03:04:37,540
calls being made from second base Oh dump truck Danny get another look at

1545
03:04:37,540 --> 03:04:40,979
that scoreboard real quick see he's double-dipping he's going in between

1546
03:04:40,979 --> 03:04:45,379
benches given the each bench a little taste of the dump truck and you notice

1547
03:04:45,379 --> 03:04:50,940
how there is just zero protest from either dugout they are with wide open

1548
03:04:50,940 --> 03:04:56,500
arms welcoming him as we get called third strike caught off of second base

1549
03:04:56,500 --> 03:05:03,139
uh-oh problems in a run down oh he's gonna try to take third he's still

1550
03:05:03,139 --> 03:05:06,020
caught in the pickle he's headed back the other way he's chopping air

1551
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:12,540
furiously great drop drop drop drop oh wait a second is there another ball out

1552
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:15,540
there does Albertson know that he's out or safe let's see what he's gonna call

1553
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:24,250
here he's been tagged out twice by two separate balls safe oh my goodness have

1554
03:05:24,250 --> 03:05:35,020
another look at this fans Lee brings you it oh you'll slide a hand but you would

1555
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:39,299
expect nothing less from the magicians right back into his pocket unbeknownst

1556
03:05:39,299 --> 03:05:44,840
to Albertson and that's the kind of stuff that have made the Maryland

1557
03:05:44,840 --> 03:05:49,520
magicians a winning ball club year in and year out yeah and you got to wonder

1558
03:05:49,520 --> 03:05:53,000
if somebody other general managers managers are on the league and they see

1559
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:57,520
Albertson playing such an impactful role right now maybe he'll get a call up and

1560
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:01,559
this is a really big moment in this game we've seen some of the power cards that

1561
03:06:01,559 --> 03:06:05,600
have been played that have made a really big impact on this game and now with

1562
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:11,719
Albertson running on the base pass for California down by two there's got to be

1563
03:06:11,719 --> 03:06:15,200
a lot of strategy being discussed there on the mound and we're seeing it right

1564
03:06:15,200 --> 03:06:22,120
now a new new elixir has been brewed by the magicians has been given to their

1565
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:26,479
keeper or excuse me their pitcher they're pulling rabbits out of hats

1566
03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:31,440
elixirs out of bottles well you know and this is why I defer to the future Hall

1567
03:06:31,440 --> 03:06:36,120
of Famer Gary Grunt I wrote brought up the question earlier in this game is

1568
03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:39,959
that elixir going to be a detriment to this magicians team you said no no no

1569
03:06:39,959 --> 03:06:43,079
this is this is something that this team needs to be consistent with

1570
03:06:43,079 --> 03:06:45,920
throughout the game and we're starting to see that here now in the late in yeah

1571
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:50,959
we used to live it by this and for the old cavemen you know the more elixir the

1572
03:06:50,959 --> 03:06:56,040
better oh finish just pulled another trick it's still in his hand oh the

1573
03:06:56,040 --> 03:07:03,840
tech comes from behind Albertson tagged out he didn't even know oh boy he

1574
03:07:03,840 --> 03:07:08,719
recognizes now there's two balls in play Albertson is privy to what's going on

1575
03:07:08,719 --> 03:07:13,149
here how does it turn out look at this the old two balls

1576
03:07:13,149 --> 03:07:27,139
oh same two balls change the drawers if there's anyone who understands that it

1577
03:07:27,139 --> 03:07:31,379
should be joy handsome after hanging out with dump truck Danny just seconds ago

1578
03:07:31,379 --> 03:07:34,059
I don't know if he's just telling everyone he has two balls or there was

1579
03:07:34,059 --> 03:07:40,270
actually two balls on the field either way you think that he would have to

1580
03:07:40,270 --> 03:07:51,079
understand and Albertson has made this a one run ballgame 1413 two ball track

1581
03:07:51,079 --> 03:07:57,399
others stricker and that is a dump truck if I have ever seen one my goodness

1582
03:07:57,399 --> 03:08:01,040
pretty flat though if you ask me I don't know nothing really happened it back

1583
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:06,559
there you must see must have a dump truck must have come from a different

1584
03:08:06,559 --> 03:08:13,319
nickname if you know what I mean well you know Danny he's he's seen his career

1585
03:08:13,319 --> 03:08:18,360
really change over the years he's he used to have that huge badonkadon

1586
03:08:18,360 --> 03:08:22,479
now he's got to get it done in different ways should call him no ass

1587
03:08:22,479 --> 03:08:29,879
well we know ask Danny security thinking look this is my chance look at look at

1588
03:08:29,879 --> 03:08:35,440
Danny just haunting him yeah bring it on the dump truck says look I got a look at

1589
03:08:35,440 --> 03:08:41,440
that jiggle jiggle you know what his money don't jiggle jiggle it folds makes

1590
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:48,959
you wiggle wiggle riding in his fiat oh my goodness thought this security

1591
03:08:48,959 --> 03:08:55,399
chasing him all game long in dump truck gets the piggy the piggyback ride he's

1592
03:08:55,399 --> 03:09:00,040
on the loose again you can't stop this he's just glowing right now with just a

1593
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:05,399
sexy sweat Xavier McMagic has moved to the mound and in the blink of an eye he

1594
03:09:05,399 --> 03:09:10,319
has delivered ball one low some serious heat coming from the right-hander and

1595
03:09:10,319 --> 03:09:14,719
dump truck starting to look a little bit worn out now that stamina starting to

1596
03:09:14,719 --> 03:09:20,360
take a hit and certainly get a little buggy the dew point is high here in the

1597
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:29,829
in the area right now is Xavier McMagic on the rubber now for the magicians two

1598
03:09:29,829 --> 03:09:34,030
point three one ERA three wins and one loss for the six foot two two and her

1599
03:09:34,030 --> 03:09:38,309
five-pound right-hander saw McMagic make some great plays in the field and

1600
03:09:38,309 --> 03:09:41,590
certainly that stamina is running down Danny dump truck a guy that's been known

1601
03:09:41,590 --> 03:09:45,629
to go all night long earlier in his career again that that career arc just

1602
03:09:45,629 --> 03:09:49,750
changing and progressing you have to learn to get it done in different ways

1603
03:09:49,750 --> 03:09:55,950
you know he used to be able to just make it happen any amount of physical force

1604
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:59,590
needed all night long he could get it done he's got to do it in more subtle

1605
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:02,829
ways now I can't tell if the security guards trying to play defense for the

1606
03:10:02,829 --> 03:10:06,430
magicians or he's just trying to work his way over to dump truck Danny and

1607
03:10:06,430 --> 03:10:10,510
he's on the move once again yeah Danny was not gonna be fooled by that security

1608
03:10:10,510 --> 03:10:17,430
guard not quite fleet of foot so back into the magicians dugout goes dump

1609
03:10:17,430 --> 03:10:21,590
truck and we had a strikeout meanwhile so two outs in the inning runner advances

1610
03:10:21,590 --> 03:10:30,440
to second base on that steel high chopper McMagic there hands it and oh my

1611
03:10:30,479 --> 03:10:35,000
goodness what would you consider that to be about feet to play the game oh my

1612
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:40,040
gosh it's up there no doubt about it between that and when the circus catcher

1613
03:10:40,040 --> 03:10:43,360
ran over into the netting to get that foul ball but that's a great play right

1614
03:10:43,360 --> 03:10:49,959
we love that play by hunter sweets as well that'll do it here for the seventh

1615
03:10:49,959 --> 03:10:53,840
inning when we come back we've got the eighth coming your way you're watching

1616
03:10:54,079 --> 03:13:17,239
the German Baseball Association right here on Twitch we've got a one-run ball

1617
03:13:17,239 --> 03:13:22,600
game here at car shield field as we come to play here in the eighth inning fans

1618
03:13:22,600 --> 03:13:27,760
in the ocean of online content there's a lot of websites and little crabs that

1619
03:13:27,760 --> 03:13:31,559
can take your info without you even knowing it but you can swim under their

1620
03:13:31,559 --> 03:13:37,280
radar using surf shark VPN and oh my goodness you're gonna want to keep a

1621
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:41,520
whole lot of stuff safe we got a fire show of sorts going on out here what is

1622
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:47,579
this this this cannot this cannot be safe drones heading over there try to

1623
03:13:47,579 --> 03:13:54,260
get a fire off here he is fire breathing we talked about fire breathing dragons

1624
03:13:54,260 --> 03:14:05,219
we've got fire breathing circus it's a firefight oh my goodness and Albertson

1625
03:14:05,219 --> 03:14:07,500
just trying to get the batter up here magicians trying to figure out who

1626
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:12,860
they're trying to send to the plate but look at this danger danger Will Robinson

1627
03:14:13,420 --> 03:14:27,280
oh my goodness whoa I've always wondered what they've you know put in their mouth

1628
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:32,120
to you and obviously it's not gasoline is it or are they drinking gasoline and

1629
03:14:32,120 --> 03:14:35,840
then blowing it into his mouth I'd love to know what he's drinking and then

1630
03:14:35,840 --> 03:14:39,479
spitting to make that happen it's got to be ever clear and look at that right

1631
03:14:39,479 --> 03:14:46,959
some type of really hard-licking moonshine meanwhile dropping the bat

1632
03:14:46,959 --> 03:14:51,799
down on this one on high deep fly ball in a right field but Craig mystery has

1633
03:14:51,799 --> 03:14:57,360
put away with the fly out for the first out of the top of the eighth looks like

1634
03:14:57,360 --> 03:15:05,739
it's just water I didn't know water did that now you do water maybe that's the

1635
03:15:05,739 --> 03:15:11,459
elixir of life the magicians and as a don't try this at home kids you have to

1636
03:15:11,459 --> 03:15:16,219
appreciate another way for you to light that fire yeah a car being played here

1637
03:15:16,899 --> 03:15:22,700
it's the playing tag there are no force outs for this half inning so all outs

1638
03:15:22,700 --> 03:15:26,579
have to come via the tag and going to go back to the cavemen creating fire

1639
03:15:26,579 --> 03:15:30,500
absolutely was going through some cold nights on the road for the caveman and

1640
03:15:30,500 --> 03:15:35,360
we certainly could have used a fire starter like that on our squad for back

1641
03:15:35,360 --> 03:15:39,739
of the day maybe explain to the fans right now for those that don't quite

1642
03:15:39,739 --> 03:15:44,739
understand how difficult it is to leave your hut where you're used to being

1643
03:15:44,780 --> 03:15:48,899
where you're comfortable to have to go on the road and learn how you're going

1644
03:15:48,899 --> 03:15:51,819
to find a source of fire all these different things that cavemen have to

1645
03:15:51,819 --> 03:15:55,700
worry about well it's not for everyone and only the finest caveman can really

1646
03:15:55,700 --> 03:15:59,979
escape the cave so there's a couple of tests you have to take you know you have

1647
03:15:59,979 --> 03:16:04,459
to count to ten can you do your ABCDs can you sing twinkle twinkle little star

1648
03:16:04,459 --> 03:16:09,979
so there's a couple of things that you have to to get done before you can leave

1649
03:16:09,979 --> 03:16:15,780
the cave and I was fortunate enough to be blessed with just an undenying ability

1650
03:16:15,780 --> 03:16:19,819
to club the baseball as well as have a couple of smarts in my brain as well

1651
03:16:19,819 --> 03:16:24,860
the voice of Gary grunt future Hall of Famer as we had a scorched single the

1652
03:16:24,860 --> 03:16:32,940
second hit of the ball game for Ronnie Smith and look at this we got another

1653
03:16:32,940 --> 03:16:39,579
card being played this time by the circus oh beach balls and life's the

1654
03:16:39,579 --> 03:16:43,020
beach and we're gonna break them out so the opposing pitcher must use a beach

1655
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:47,899
ball for this next how about this strategy only tagouts go to the beach

1656
03:16:47,899 --> 03:16:55,020
ball yeah brilliant move now we just need the beach ball so I don't know if

1657
03:16:55,020 --> 03:17:00,469
someone has a blown up how it comes out the magicians dug out oh how convenient

1658
03:17:00,469 --> 03:17:12,270
coach handsome bringing the ball out oh taunting you know joy he's no he's done

1659
03:17:12,270 --> 03:17:18,350
a nice job though pushing the line not getting too far on Elbertson's bad side

1660
03:17:18,350 --> 03:17:24,510
as we saw the circus just took it over the top in those middle innings

1661
03:17:24,510 --> 03:17:29,219
look at this defensive alignment yep they're thinking this is gonna be an

1662
03:17:29,219 --> 03:17:35,059
easy out the amoeba defense a knuckleball didn't quite make it to the

1663
03:17:35,059 --> 03:17:44,399
play pitch and it's a 30-footer oh no say just inside they call it a ball it's

1664
03:17:44,399 --> 03:17:47,920
a ball yeah it's so important with this beach ball you got to get the right

1665
03:17:47,920 --> 03:17:51,719
spin if there's any kind of slider or downward action on it you see you see

1666
03:17:51,719 --> 03:17:54,360
there he's not getting the proper backspin that's never gonna make it the

1667
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:59,120
home plate can't get over the top of the ball right now and runner on third as

1668
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:04,479
again all circus position players are in the infield at Fred circus he's

1669
03:18:04,479 --> 03:18:07,959
sitting at a three four five ERA but this beach ball is threatening to balloon

1670
03:18:07,959 --> 03:18:15,850
his ERA dump truck doesn't like it oh Danny's trying to get involved oh he

1671
03:18:15,850 --> 03:18:20,729
can't get it oh look at this Elbertson put a hand on him I think Elbertson just wanted to

1672
03:18:20,729 --> 03:18:26,049
get a hold of the dump truck Elbertson grasping for that dump truck as hard as

1673
03:18:26,049 --> 03:18:31,139
he can yeah I can't grab those dump trucks too sweaty right now too misty

1674
03:18:31,139 --> 03:18:36,100
elusive you got to watch out the the swamp ass factor is a big thing in these

1675
03:18:36,100 --> 03:18:40,100
kind of situations you grab anywhere around the waist it's gonna be tough to

1676
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:45,139
corral let's just be thankful that the umpire Elbertson did get any of the

1677
03:18:45,139 --> 03:18:48,540
waste action because we could have seen a lot more than a golden thong oh my

1678
03:18:48,540 --> 03:18:57,620
goodness they're coming home with it he tags him out oh my goodness what a half

1679
03:18:57,620 --> 03:19:03,940
fitting the power cards being played it does not matter the California circus

1680
03:19:03,940 --> 03:19:10,059
are still alive going to the bottom of the eighth it's a one run ball game you

1681
03:19:10,059 --> 03:19:15,219
will not want to miss it what a play have another look as we go to break

1682
03:19:15,219 --> 03:21:27,020
that's up Chuck with the play we'll be right back after this on twitch and how

1683
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:31,700
about that you make an amazing play in the field and right after that Manny up

1684
03:21:31,700 --> 03:21:36,659
Chuck 69 to the plate 69 ha ha ha we did a lot of that in my play in David the

1685
03:21:36,659 --> 03:21:43,360
caveman certainly no doubt about it and now the magicians have just been teepee

1686
03:21:43,360 --> 03:21:48,360
absolutely teepee to hell is that the new version of a being rick rolled

1687
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:54,500
they've been they've been rolled there's no doubt about that up Chuck watches it

1688
03:21:54,500 --> 03:22:01,500
sail over his head there's a lot going on in tonight's game and you know that's

1689
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:05,079
that's all part of it it's it's the level of focus that you bring in the

1690
03:22:05,079 --> 03:22:09,379
late innings in a game like this one run ball game toilet paper being thrown

1691
03:22:09,379 --> 03:22:13,340
people are getting pied in the face straight now a 90 mile an hour fastball

1692
03:22:13,340 --> 03:22:18,620
right at the knees just all in one games play here at the JBA by the way this is

1693
03:22:18,620 --> 03:22:25,700
jack port on the mount 8.76 ERA for the season as up Chuck tips it into the mid

1694
03:22:25,700 --> 03:22:31,780
69 not the correct number right now no not at all as you see ports numbers

1695
03:22:31,780 --> 03:22:36,780
their opponent average of 168 is whip at 110 that's exactly where you want your

1696
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:42,180
numbers to be a successful to be if you want to be a successful pitcher up check

1697
03:22:42,379 --> 03:22:45,700
take strike three hates the outside corner

1698
03:22:45,700 --> 03:22:50,579
guys swing the bat you can't if you're if you're gonna wear a number 69 you

1699
03:22:50,579 --> 03:22:55,860
can't just go down without a swing no look you're gonna wear number 69 you

1700
03:22:55,860 --> 03:23:00,940
gotta have the cojones the big marbles to be able to swing the bat

1701
03:23:00,940 --> 03:23:08,360
speaking of big marbles he's loose again dump truck Danny I mean this guy you

1702
03:23:08,360 --> 03:23:11,479
almost feel bad for the security guard trying to keep this well you know what

1703
03:23:11,680 --> 03:23:16,520
I feel bad for dump truck Danny that I was dogging his stamina earlier in this

1704
03:23:16,520 --> 03:23:22,510
game look at this dude go he does hot yoga so he's got the stamina and people

1705
03:23:22,510 --> 03:23:26,829
don't realize just how sweaty you get when you do hot yoga dump truck Danny

1706
03:23:26,829 --> 03:23:32,790
has those pores just permanently open as this is booted it short and that will

1707
03:23:32,790 --> 03:23:42,239
allow him at first base to reach that's hairy helium dump truck Danny back at

1708
03:23:42,239 --> 03:23:52,379
it again look at this guy security guy just no chance for this look oh my that

1709
03:23:52,379 --> 03:23:57,020
is a beautiful job and you know what Gary you have to appreciate that yeah oh

1710
03:23:57,020 --> 03:24:02,340
here we go right right through into the cave there he goes and dump truck is

1711
03:24:02,340 --> 03:24:10,719
gone oh I see it's like a looney tunes Warner Brothers thing yeah you can't go

1712
03:24:10,719 --> 03:24:18,000
in sorry access D9 sorry that's only dump truck Danny's oh my look at this

1713
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:24,440
that's dump truck Danny's territory no entering that cave I mean if bugs had

1714
03:24:24,440 --> 03:24:35,979
just a golden speedo it's dump truck Danny the golden speedo of love the

1715
03:24:35,979 --> 03:24:44,770
pitch comes in high sweaty nasty smelly love and let's not forget the role that

1716
03:24:45,010 --> 03:24:49,450
crew chief Albertson played in this game to keep this within reach for

1717
03:24:49,450 --> 03:24:53,010
California he was huge coming in when they didn't have enough players to play

1718
03:24:53,010 --> 03:24:56,649
this one's popped into foul territory third baseman going back on it and he

1719
03:24:56,649 --> 03:25:01,829
makes the play down to his knees well done and the Maryland Magicians now have

1720
03:25:01,829 --> 03:25:04,930
two outs in the inning here in the top of the earth see me the bottom of the

1721
03:25:04,930 --> 03:25:08,409
eighth inning mystery doesn't spend a lot of time on his knees but does a

1722
03:25:08,409 --> 03:25:13,469
great job here dump truck Danny knows a thing or two about that and he would

1723
03:25:13,469 --> 03:25:24,819
approve two outs runner at first base is Harry helium and now Paul Laffington

1724
03:25:24,819 --> 03:25:29,540
grounded out his last time up he's 0 for 2 that pitch gets away and helium into

1725
03:25:29,540 --> 03:25:35,239
scoring position now with two downs the game the game's potential tying run at

1726
03:25:35,239 --> 03:25:39,159
second base you get a look at that scoreboard it is 16 hits for the

1727
03:25:39,159 --> 03:25:46,940
Magicians as high as we get as high as we get it's 15 so as soon as we get to 16

1728
03:25:46,940 --> 03:25:50,860
they turned it upside down so I wonder if they get 17 hits is it the upside

1729
03:25:50,860 --> 03:25:54,500
down 14 they go the other way do they go back down and just put the numbers

1730
03:25:54,500 --> 03:25:59,139
upside down Harry we haven't seen this many runs scored in quite some time or this

1731
03:25:59,139 --> 03:26:04,340
many hits at least I mean this league is known for low scoring and really good

1732
03:26:04,340 --> 03:26:08,340
pitching but tonight that that storyline has been flown out the window you see

1733
03:26:08,340 --> 03:26:14,659
it with the point seven six ERA from Jack Port as he delivers a nasty one

1734
03:26:14,659 --> 03:26:19,620
underneath the hands of Laffington all he could do was foul it away and try to

1735
03:26:19,620 --> 03:26:26,299
live for another one into his account here it's something else that's that's

1736
03:26:26,299 --> 03:26:32,020
really important I think as a ballplayer you see that quick grab between the legs

1737
03:26:32,020 --> 03:26:36,979
in between pitches adjust your nuts adjust your swing that that's typically

1738
03:26:36,979 --> 03:26:42,219
the approach yeah pretty much you know you want to get comfortable and sometimes

1739
03:26:42,219 --> 03:26:47,180
you got long balls up there you got to keep it short I got to keep the wide

1740
03:26:47,299 --> 03:26:54,459
stance of the hang and you're just looking to make contact contact is the

1741
03:26:54,459 --> 03:27:02,620
key all the pickoff moving they got him in second base what a play the magicians

1742
03:27:02,620 --> 03:27:09,420
pulling out of their sleeve to get out of the inning fans this inning is brought

1746
03:28:59,750 --> 03:29:06,469
we have entered the final and ninth inning of a wild 14 13 ball game even

1747
03:29:06,670 --> 03:29:12,309
Elbertson starting to run a little bit short fused out here yeah there's been a

1748
03:29:12,309 --> 03:29:16,670
lot of antics which we are known to see here the J.B.A. sometimes they can get a

1749
03:29:16,670 --> 03:29:21,549
little too wacky and you know every man has its limit and Elbertson you know it

1750
03:29:21,549 --> 03:29:27,549
may have been reached right now you know I gotta say for a one-man crew chief on

1751
03:29:27,549 --> 03:29:31,629
an artificial field this is the cleanest home plate I have ever seen kept he's

1752
03:29:31,629 --> 03:29:35,989
done a nice job clean keeping the home plate clean you know you think that his

1753
03:29:35,989 --> 03:29:41,350
wife appreciates the cleanliness when he gets back home to the sugar mama

1754
03:29:41,350 --> 03:29:46,510
tonight salmon trying to bunt his way aboard to lead off this top of the

1755
03:29:46,510 --> 03:29:51,469
ninth but to no avail and Elbertson has injured himself and whoever he has to

1756
03:29:51,469 --> 03:29:57,069
come in for next will probably not want that injured Elbertson on their squat

1757
03:29:57,069 --> 03:30:00,790
shaking it off in the left hand I don't think we have an ambulance on site here

1758
03:30:00,790 --> 03:30:05,229
so you may have to make that call should it get any worse for Elbertson

1759
03:30:05,229 --> 03:30:09,909
this is Fred circus on the mound delivering inside one and one the count

1760
03:30:09,909 --> 03:30:14,069
fans another reminder that after this game we have got coverage from around

1761
03:30:14,069 --> 03:30:19,170
the league for you it's crunch time it'll be Tom Chairman joined by Dickie

1762
03:30:19,170 --> 03:30:24,149
Drek coming your way right after this one and that Mike salmon is contesting

1763
03:30:24,149 --> 03:30:27,829
that that one hit him in the arm now as he is acting as if it hit him in the arm

1764
03:30:27,829 --> 03:30:30,549
I thought it caught a little bit of his jersey but didn't catch him in the arm I

1765
03:30:30,549 --> 03:30:34,510
didn't think he saw that he sold it salmon has sold it we'll get a replay of

1766
03:30:34,510 --> 03:30:39,870
it here and Elbertson buying it look at it it definitely came inside right in

1767
03:30:39,870 --> 03:30:43,870
that armpit area and it may have caught him in the arm hit the left arm look

1768
03:30:43,870 --> 03:30:49,549
like you hit the back of his right arm so first base has been awarded ball

1769
03:30:49,549 --> 03:30:56,190
clown back on the field it's black up more balls for Elbertson you know that

1770
03:30:56,190 --> 03:30:59,670
was a little bit of a cheap shot from Elbertson I mean this guy has been

1771
03:30:59,670 --> 03:31:03,909
helping him out retrieving balls all game long and rewards him with a swift

1772
03:31:03,909 --> 03:31:09,149
kick to the nuts like I said every man has its limits and right now I think

1773
03:31:09,149 --> 03:31:20,620
Elbertson has reached his now he's going over to talk to the fans leadoff man has

1774
03:31:20,620 --> 03:31:27,940
reached in this inning and Mike salmon it's now Donald strange at the plate

1775
03:31:27,940 --> 03:31:37,450
here in the ninth inning and this one is driven in the left field going back on

1776
03:31:37,450 --> 03:31:43,250
it the catch is made for the first out of the unit good wood there just not

1777
03:31:43,250 --> 03:31:46,889
enough height underneath that ball to get over the left fielder's head and a

1778
03:31:46,889 --> 03:31:52,770
good play out and left field routine play for the left fielder here about ten

1779
03:31:52,770 --> 03:32:03,680
steps back position make that snag good play and there is the victorious

1780
03:32:03,719 --> 03:32:08,879
mascot oh yeah took it to Dumbledore earlier now he's enjoying the fruits of

1781
03:32:08,879 --> 03:32:17,129
his victory trying to distract his own picture apparently it's working after

1782
03:32:17,129 --> 03:32:24,670
a ball look oh that's maybe he's just giving crew chief Elbertson exactly

1783
03:32:24,670 --> 03:32:37,180
what he needs here well contact oh oh oh oh Dumbledore wants revenge oh my

1784
03:32:37,180 --> 03:32:46,860
goodness oh yeah that that turned rather quickly yeah this is supposed to be

1785
03:32:46,860 --> 03:32:53,260
family show apologize to the kids out there oh hammered in the ass the mascot

1786
03:32:53,260 --> 03:33:00,479
mascot love it happening here nobody wants to see that on live television

1787
03:33:00,479 --> 03:33:06,090
that's why they go to the internet for that stuff this is technically live

1788
03:33:06,090 --> 03:33:11,709
television on the internet that's the way you do expect it just another day in

1789
03:33:11,709 --> 03:33:17,719
the JBA some some people say backdoor guests are best inside with that bitch

1790
03:33:17,719 --> 03:33:24,590
borderline from Fred circus he removes the hat unhappy with the call here comes

1791
03:33:24,590 --> 03:33:36,959
another one this time it's outside and circus leaning can't believe it it's a

1792
03:33:36,959 --> 03:33:49,659
walk no three and one now big cut in a miss from Xavier make magic big magic

1793
03:33:49,659 --> 03:33:59,379
had the ground rule double back in the fourth inning the payoff is spoiled big

1794
03:33:59,379 --> 03:34:07,420
moments in this game one out runner at second base in a one-run game the

1795
03:34:07,420 --> 03:34:16,500
magicians trying to add insurance here in the top half of the ninth come for

1796
03:34:16,500 --> 03:34:25,030
the baseball stay for the mascot love it or should I say mascot humping that

1797
03:34:25,030 --> 03:34:29,549
one's filed off oh oh that was surely gonna hit the car over there would have

1798
03:34:29,549 --> 03:34:34,299
been a point the insurance claim yeah how did your car windshield break well

1799
03:34:34,379 --> 03:34:40,780
the JBA and pitch got filed off next thing you know if I replace my windshield

1800
03:34:40,780 --> 03:34:47,219
people would understand get a look over there oh the late swing but they call

1801
03:34:47,219 --> 03:34:52,260
ball for Wow they award him first base and look at this Fred circus not even

1802
03:34:52,260 --> 03:34:56,959
contesting that call I have no words for this that hunter sweets is just not up

1803
03:34:56,959 --> 03:35:05,090
in arms here runners on first and second for the

1804
03:35:05,090 --> 03:35:12,059
magicians in front here in the top half of the ninth inning Martin majestic came

1805
03:35:12,059 --> 03:35:17,700
in as a pinch hitter a couple innings ago he comes to the dish once again now

1806
03:35:17,700 --> 03:35:24,079
look at Fred big top he's like look he's one we are approaching a four-hour game

complications on the line oh majestic taken by surprise by the pitch but it's

1809
03:35:40,590 --> 03:35:49,219
high ball one the next from circus in for a strike in majestic looking up

1810
03:35:49,219 --> 03:36:00,959
above his head high fly ball in the medium-depth center field towards right

1811
03:36:00,959 --> 03:36:05,360
center the catch is made both runners tag fire towards third base in the pick

1812
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:10,799
unable to be made it skips over the sidewall out of play and home plate is

1813
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:25,030
awarded it's a 15-13 magicians lead and that was a nice arm from out in

1814
03:36:25,030 --> 03:36:29,709
centerfield from David Hawk just caught it on the in-between hot yeah not this

1815
03:36:29,709 --> 03:36:34,549
kind of scoops you want to see from a third baseman there short hopped him

1816
03:36:34,549 --> 03:36:40,590
almost like a Roger Dorn he gave you the ole bullshit and you know they they may

1817
03:36:40,590 --> 03:36:45,709
get him some extra work back in the bathroom I know Albertson has certainly

1818
03:36:45,750 --> 03:36:51,709
provided some work for someone and we'll see if it'll be scoops over at third

1819
03:36:51,709 --> 03:36:56,790
base Sean giggles might not be laughing about that one after the game giggling

1820
03:36:56,790 --> 03:37:02,909
after that especially the run scores one and oh the count it's Roy Flushman

1821
03:37:02,909 --> 03:37:09,389
again as he takes up and throw down to second base it is a stolen base late

1822
03:37:09,389 --> 03:37:13,389
throw I believe that was Mitch Mick magic luring that throw kind of stopped

1823
03:37:13,430 --> 03:37:23,889
about three quarters of the way he did the 2-0 pitch pulled on the ground foul

1824
03:37:23,889 --> 03:37:37,629
down the third base side and ball clown to home plates lying fresh set of balls

1825
03:37:37,629 --> 03:37:50,889
gives a tweet of the horn it wasn't a fart that was a tweet long turn in a

1826
03:37:50,889 --> 03:38:04,450
pitch is fouled back out of play to to count here oh quick pitch try to catch

1827
03:38:04,450 --> 03:38:11,430
him off guard play made by the third baseman throw across is away and another

1828
03:38:11,430 --> 03:38:17,030
error on the circus there's gonna have to be some serious poop and scoop and

1829
03:38:17,030 --> 03:38:20,829
going on after this game for the circus oh my goodness he lost the ball doesn't

1830
03:38:20,829 --> 03:38:24,069
know where it is no one knows where it is we're all doing 360s out here

1831
03:38:24,069 --> 03:38:31,030
Albertson oh oh it's a pickle throw it back home he's caught in the rundown

1832
03:38:31,909 --> 03:38:37,629
it's another great play by up Chuck he has been on point defensively in this

1833
03:38:37,629 --> 03:38:42,829
game for the circus yeah a mental mistake there for the magicians opens

1834
03:38:42,829 --> 03:38:46,750
the door up a little bit here for the circus as they had an easy run there

1835
03:38:46,750 --> 03:38:51,069
instead of a three run lead it's now just a two run lead as Aaron base

1836
03:38:51,069 --> 03:38:54,950
running costing costing the magician just when you thought the magicians have

1837
03:38:54,950 --> 03:38:59,389
seen this one a million times they get caught off guard and that'll do it for

1838
03:38:59,389 --> 03:39:04,229
the top half of the night one last chance for the circus when we come back

1839
03:39:04,229 --> 03:42:09,760
you're watching the German Baseball Association on Twitch welcome back

1840
03:42:09,760 --> 03:42:14,879
entering the ninth inning of play we've got a two run ballgame the California

1841
03:42:14,879 --> 03:42:19,479
circus trying to get back into this one against the Maryland magicians I am

1842
03:42:19,479 --> 03:42:25,120
Storm Williamson joined by my partner here Gary grunt the Phoenix caveman

1843
03:42:25,120 --> 03:42:29,079
great we've been treated to some tremendous baseball tonight and you

1844
03:42:29,079 --> 03:42:32,159
would expect a fireworks finish in this one yeah a lot of run score with the

1845
03:42:32,159 --> 03:42:36,120
magicians going into this final half inning with a two run lead circus still

1846
03:42:36,120 --> 03:42:40,799
with a chance it could easily tie this one up we'll see if they can close it

1847
03:42:40,799 --> 03:42:48,389
out Paul at car shield field Paul laughing tin first to the dish he ducks

1848
03:42:48,389 --> 03:42:58,829
out of the way of all one still Jack port on the mound for the Maryland

1849
03:42:58,829 --> 03:43:14,799
magicians it's two and oh to laughing to make it three and oh not what you want

1850
03:43:14,799 --> 03:43:18,280
to see out of your guy in the ninth inning with a two run lead and three

1851
03:43:18,280 --> 03:43:23,559
straight balls your top closer you want him coming in pump and strikes oh my

1852
03:43:23,559 --> 03:43:34,620
gosh jackhammers that one but yanks it well foul three and one laughing tin is

1853
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:45,090
over to ground it out his last time up in the sixth pops it up behind home

1854
03:43:45,090 --> 03:43:52,579
plate Flushman can't locate it and it'll land foul harmlessly it'll stay alive

1855
03:43:52,579 --> 03:43:58,520
here good work to take that all right yeah Austin lights catcher couldn't find

1856
03:43:58,520 --> 03:44:21,149
it three and to the count now to Paul laughing tin extremely shallow in the

1857
03:44:21,149 --> 03:44:26,629
outfield for laughing tin as he pops it up on the infield pitcher coming in for

1858
03:44:26,629 --> 03:44:31,389
it and makes the grab first out Jack board comes back from three and oh to

1859
03:44:31,389 --> 03:44:36,909
record the first out so the circus down to the last two outs need to find some

1860
03:44:36,909 --> 03:44:41,549
of that magic and steal it from the magicians and get it into their bats oh

1861
03:44:41,549 --> 03:44:46,870
we're gonna have another at bat here from look at this okay oh and we're

1862
03:44:46,870 --> 03:44:55,590
getting a power card played oh the power card 5x being played by the circus

1863
03:44:56,549 --> 03:45:03,709
manager the player at bat is allowed five strikes before they're out not three

1864
03:45:03,709 --> 03:45:08,709
strikes in your out it's five strikes and you're out for this next at bat saved

1865
03:45:08,709 --> 03:45:12,870
it for just the right time yeah near desperation mode you got to create a

1866
03:45:12,870 --> 03:45:17,229
spark and you know might as well give one of your better hitters a better

1867
03:45:17,229 --> 03:45:26,350
chance to put something in play take some packs as well so now Greg shake

1868
03:45:26,389 --> 03:45:31,829
that Laffy Taffy will have a couple extra strikes to work with check that it

1869
03:45:31,829 --> 03:45:36,389
is it's Albertson in the game he threw out the Laffy Taffy unfortunately

1870
03:45:36,389 --> 03:45:42,530
Albert's gonna hit again he's got the five strikes so it was one for one on the

1871
03:45:42,530 --> 03:45:45,850
day you see the umpires got five home runs on the air they could use one of

1872
03:45:45,850 --> 03:45:59,200
those right now to tie this game first pitch to him ties him up in nuts if you

1873
03:45:59,200 --> 03:46:03,000
saw that storm but there was a waft of smoke going home going on behind home

1874
03:46:03,000 --> 03:46:06,959
played don't know if someone's got the wacky weed going out the devil's lettuce

1875
03:46:06,959 --> 03:46:13,379
but pop fly on the infield again couldn't get to it dribbling towards

1876
03:46:13,379 --> 03:46:17,739
first base and that's why they are not professional basketball players he's

1877
03:46:17,739 --> 03:46:22,840
safe not a professional track player either as Albertson tripping over his

1878
03:46:22,840 --> 03:46:26,520
own feet down that first base line eventually did make it though good run

1879
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:32,559
here but we'll watch the lack of form here from the umpire Albertson I mean

1880
03:46:32,600 --> 03:46:37,280
Jack Ford he nearly pulled that off it would have been awfully impressive but

1881
03:46:37,280 --> 03:46:42,079
you know Albertson for an umpire you think he'd understand that you can run

1882
03:46:42,079 --> 03:46:49,520
through first base sure yeah one would think but who knows what's going on in

1883
03:46:49,520 --> 03:46:54,719
the mind of Albertson how sweets would it be if Hunter after being plunked by

1884
03:46:54,719 --> 03:46:58,799
two pitches in this game ends up being the hero it's a fly ball in the left

1885
03:46:58,799 --> 03:47:02,239
field they were playing extremely shallow it's over his head look out

1886
03:47:02,239 --> 03:47:07,559
Albertson rounding second he's headed towards third the throw in from right

1887
03:47:07,559 --> 03:47:14,680
field is high Albertson is going for home nobody there covering a late throw

1888
03:47:14,680 --> 03:47:20,600
home and Albertson is safe we've got a one run game in advancing to third is

1889
03:47:20,600 --> 03:47:25,819
Hunter sweets with just one out I got just more impressed with some of the

1890
03:47:25,819 --> 03:47:29,920
shaving cream or the pie the face still Albertson out there still running hard

1891
03:47:29,920 --> 03:47:37,959
he's got pie remnants on his jersey pie remnants on his deck still able to make

1892
03:47:37,959 --> 03:47:45,639
it first at home great speed from Albertson you have never seen it look he's I can't

1893
03:47:45,639 --> 03:47:49,559
shake hand he's got he has to stay impartial so great job there from I have

1894
03:47:49,559 --> 03:47:53,680
never seen I have never seen better professionality from a from an umpire

1895
03:47:53,680 --> 03:47:59,040
in this league in all of my years in this I you know what Gary this is my

1896
03:47:59,040 --> 03:48:02,280
third year in this league I've never seen anything like that and meanwhile we

1897
03:48:02,280 --> 03:48:10,590
get another drive that'll split the gap in left-center David Honk has done it he

1898
03:48:10,590 --> 03:48:18,149
has tied us up 15 all this game it can't get any more bunkers we've had

1899
03:48:18,149 --> 03:48:24,709
streakers 15 runs now a piece this game is crazy and we were tied here with one

1900
03:48:24,709 --> 03:48:29,670
down in the bottom of the ninth inning extra innings looming here at Cardio

1901
03:48:29,709 --> 03:48:38,469
field and that was a drive right there great swing you know I feel like we

1902
03:48:38,469 --> 03:48:40,790
haven't seen a streaker in a while I wonder if he's gonna make another

1903
03:48:40,790 --> 03:48:46,270
appearance but you think he did provide a spark for the magicians and if you're

1904
03:48:46,270 --> 03:48:51,389
the you're the manager for the magicians coach handsome you're wondering where

1905
03:48:51,389 --> 03:48:55,790
that streaker is maybe get some of that hot yoga lovin and any ballplayer would

1906
03:48:55,790 --> 03:49:04,149
tell you nothing to spark a rally like a good dump truck sir one out runner at

1907
03:49:04,149 --> 03:49:07,829
second base line shot towards short it's off the end of his webbing into

1908
03:49:07,829 --> 03:49:11,389
centerfield and the throw into third base they've got him caught in a pickle

1909
03:49:11,389 --> 03:49:15,709
but it gets past his glove off the facing of the dugout so that nearly

1910
03:49:15,709 --> 03:49:21,709
would have been another run home in a potential game ender but instead we've

1911
03:49:21,709 --> 03:49:26,430
got runners on the corners with one down yeah a heads-up play to take that

1912
03:49:26,430 --> 03:49:34,790
third base on that left side the winning run now just 90 feet away that just ate

1913
03:49:34,790 --> 03:49:40,030
the shortstop up couldn't get the glove out on it and Aaron throw a good throw

1914
03:49:40,030 --> 03:49:45,069
just too much mustard on that bun and got beyond the glove of the third

1915
03:49:45,069 --> 03:49:51,680
baseman a fastball thrown by the center fielder third baseman unable to haul it

1916
03:49:51,680 --> 03:49:59,639
in so a fantastic chance here California circus to sneak in a victory

1917
03:49:59,639 --> 03:50:04,399
and come from behind victory they were down 8 to 2 at one point in this game

1918
03:50:04,399 --> 03:50:09,639
they were up 11 to 8 then they were trailed again and they tied it so back

1919
03:50:09,639 --> 03:50:14,959
and forth we go in this seesaw battle between the magicians and the circus

1920
03:50:14,959 --> 03:50:20,520
enjoy handsome is telling his team look guys I was standing on the top step step

1921
03:50:20,520 --> 03:50:24,959
of the dugout looking pretty up by two and now what have you guys done to me

1922
03:50:24,959 --> 03:50:29,200
handsome is as handsome does and right now the play of the magicians not so

1923
03:50:29,200 --> 03:50:37,940
handsome all knotted at 15 in the bottom of the night majestic man oh look at

1924
03:50:37,940 --> 03:50:49,129
this a whole bundle of bats for Sean Giggles and it looks like crew chief

1925
03:50:49,129 --> 03:50:54,809
Elbertson is allowing this I think it's a ten bat max moving can have so he's

1926
03:50:54,809 --> 03:51:00,299
still under the limit here and now they're gonna say the third baseman is

1927
03:51:00,299 --> 03:51:08,239
out in another hidden ball trick oh my goodness two down now the magicians pull

1928
03:51:08,239 --> 03:51:13,520
a rabbit out of their hat at the most crucial point of this game boy the

1929
03:51:13,520 --> 03:51:18,680
magicians Alliance is really gonna like that one the game winning run cut down

1930
03:51:18,680 --> 03:51:27,930
from third base now that game winner would have to come from first a heavy

1931
03:51:27,969 --> 03:51:37,340
batter here in a multitude of ways the first pitch comes in tall g-double-o-d-e-y-e

1932
03:51:37,340 --> 03:51:51,889
good eye good eye the pitch and he dribbles it back to the mound no problem for

1933
03:51:51,889 --> 03:51:56,129
Jack Port you gotta we've got free baseball you gotta wonder what the weight

1934
03:51:56,129 --> 03:52:02,090
of the bats you know implementer you know really affected that hit you'd have

1935
03:52:02,090 --> 03:52:07,209
to think a little bit as we get set for the 10th inning of play you're watching

1936
03:52:07,209 --> 03:53:41,500
the JVA on Twitch welcome back to car shield field in the extra innings of a

1937
03:53:41,500 --> 03:53:48,920
15-15 ball game and another power card coming out the start extras triple

1938
03:53:48,920 --> 03:53:54,579
vision there will be three pitchers on the mound for the circus here in the top

1939
03:53:54,620 --> 03:53:58,700
half of the 10th I've heard of the foreigner double vision but the triple

1940
03:53:58,700 --> 03:54:05,139
vision is a new one on me so we'll see how this affects the circus as two more

1941
03:54:05,139 --> 03:54:09,459
pitchers have been called in or see the effects the magicians is two more

1942
03:54:09,459 --> 03:54:14,139
pitchers will be called to the mound to make it a free spot and it will only be

1943
03:54:14,139 --> 03:54:19,500
for one at bat so this lead-off batter will have to face three pitchers

1944
03:54:19,500 --> 03:54:28,549
simultaneously

1945
03:54:32,549 --> 03:54:37,270
he's not on the roster let's see if Albertson will allow this I do believe

1946
03:54:37,270 --> 03:54:45,629
there are shorts and players need extra baseballs here as well the clown boy ran

1947
03:54:45,629 --> 03:54:56,950
out of balls leave it to the clown boy there's clown boy the great job of

1948
03:54:56,950 --> 03:55:03,469
replenishing Albertson's balls here tonight really been a big favorite of

1949
03:55:03,469 --> 03:55:08,989
mine throughout my years in this league just a model of consistency and one of

1950
03:55:08,989 --> 03:55:12,469
the all-time good guys in this league yeah it gets a lot of respect around the

1951
03:55:12,469 --> 03:55:16,829
league does a good job shining the bats rubbing the balls down getting them

1952
03:55:16,829 --> 03:55:21,510
ready for a BP and just doing whatever a clown boy can do to help the team you

1953
03:55:21,510 --> 03:55:26,309
know another one of those things that goes unnoticed who would rub these

1954
03:55:26,309 --> 03:55:30,430
balls down if it weren't for him nope I mean it had to be one of the players

1955
03:55:30,430 --> 03:55:34,229
maybe they had to rub their own balls so look at this first three pitches come

1956
03:55:34,229 --> 03:55:41,709
in and Albertson nearly wore three of them so so we got strike one as well as

1957
03:55:41,709 --> 03:55:45,790
a couple of balls delivered there so a two-and-one count here to Craig mystery

1958
03:55:45,790 --> 03:55:50,110
who is two for five in this game mystery hasn't been a mystery at the plate so

1959
03:55:50,110 --> 03:55:53,950
far so if it's a good wood on a couple of heads and had some bad ball luck on

1960
03:55:53,950 --> 03:56:05,920
the others just unmatched here they come oh he made contact one-on-ones in play

1961
03:56:05,920 --> 03:56:11,639
look out here and with the power card he still reaches first Aaron throw he's

1962
03:56:11,639 --> 03:56:16,200
headed to second base still ever retrieve that baseball mystery headed to

1963
03:56:16,200 --> 03:56:22,440
third and the leadoff man is just 90 feet away still nobody out waiting for

1964
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:28,440
the throw and home oh but the other two balls are still in play

1965
03:56:28,440 --> 03:56:32,479
boy applies the time

1966
03:56:40,909 --> 03:56:45,549
oh you did all three balls only going at two of the three balls gonna have three

1967
03:56:45,549 --> 03:56:50,350
balls to complete the cycle oh my goodness how could they have forgotten

1968
03:56:51,030 --> 03:56:57,229
it look now this is this is unwarranted Hunter sweets taking his anger out on

1969
03:56:57,229 --> 03:57:00,829
clown boy clown boy was in the right spot at the right time yeah right spot

1970
03:57:00,829 --> 03:57:07,149
the right time he can't blame clown boy on this one and you wonder how that that

1971
03:57:07,149 --> 03:57:11,229
affects this the team chemistry moving forward I know it's not every day that

1972
03:57:11,229 --> 03:57:15,309
clown boy gets into the game but he's got to feel awfully unappreciated in a

1973
03:57:15,309 --> 03:57:19,069
moment like this I mean look at the way a hunter sweets ran into his own pitcher

1974
03:57:19,069 --> 03:57:22,989
and then he's gonna try to clown clown boy yeah you know come on come play

1975
03:57:22,989 --> 03:57:28,239
there's no climbing club that's just terrible so that should have been the

1976
03:57:28,239 --> 03:57:33,270
winning run but we're continuing here we're still in the top half yeah we're

1977
03:57:33,270 --> 03:57:38,719
gonna oh it's top half of the 10th inning here my bad it has been a long

1978
03:57:38,719 --> 03:57:42,959
night of baseball I will I just keep thinking I'm hoping Dumbledore is okay

1979
03:57:42,959 --> 03:57:47,280
I mean he got pinned in the locker room and just hope he's fine

1980
03:57:48,590 --> 03:57:53,670
he's found the elder one and that one's in for the call strike oh two and oh my

1981
03:57:53,670 --> 03:57:59,790
goodness everyone clearing the bench for the magicians oh my goodness this is bad

1982
03:57:59,790 --> 03:58:05,229
and the pitcher goes down in a heap Fred circus just clinging for his life what

1983
03:58:05,229 --> 03:58:08,190
is happening all the mascots are looking for one another oh they're taking their

1984
03:58:08,190 --> 03:58:13,270
mascot oh boy this utter chaos all the mascots are stripping down to their

1985
03:58:13,270 --> 03:58:18,229
skivvies and going at it every player from every from the magicians and the

1986
03:58:18,229 --> 03:58:23,989
circus are on the field right now how is Albertson going to handle this one he's

1987
03:58:23,989 --> 03:58:28,030
just tossing people left and right now the magicians have cleared the dugout

1988
03:58:28,030 --> 03:58:33,709
beer man is on the field fans have stormed the playing surface this is

1989
03:58:33,709 --> 03:58:39,840
insane boy the mascots are really going at a little hanky-panky play played right

1990
03:58:39,879 --> 03:58:47,159
now I have never seen a higher stakes game of hanky-panky in my life oh and a

1991
03:58:47,159 --> 03:58:51,719
big field goal kick of the clown mascot head oh and a takedown by the wizard

1992
03:58:51,719 --> 03:58:57,920
this is an absolute mess the crunch time is gonna have a one hell of a time

1993
03:58:57,920 --> 03:59:02,719
breaking down this game to see crunch time our postgame analysis coming right

1994
03:59:02,719 --> 03:59:08,479
after this yeah Albertson's called it Albertson has called this oh my goodness

1995
03:59:08,479 --> 03:59:13,200
we'll sort it all out in postgame this this is insane into the clown show this

1996
03:59:13,200 --> 03:59:17,600
game has been called it what really no surprise that this one would end this

1997
03:59:17,600 --> 03:59:21,879
way in 10 innings what a game we're gonna toss it to studio Tom Chairman and

1998
03:59:21,879 --> 03:59:39,799
Dickie Dreck take it away back to another episode of crunch time I'm Tom

1999
03:59:39,799 --> 03:59:44,959
Chairman and I'm Dickie Dreck and once again it's that time time to take a look

2000
03:59:44,959 --> 03:59:49,440
at some league highlights from today's games and boy oh boy it was a heck of a

2001
03:59:49,440 --> 03:59:54,120
day on the ball field indeed it was a doozy of a day Dickie let's dive right

2002
03:59:54,120 --> 03:59:57,719
in go to the diamond for the first game of the afternoon where the Delaware

2003
03:59:57,719 --> 04:00:02,719
drunkards dally with the Montpellier Mimes well fans were treated to another

2004
04:00:02,719 --> 04:00:08,520
classic matchup as the Mimes outfoxed the drunkards in all aspects of the game

2005
04:00:08,520 --> 04:00:29,879
as they usually do hitting pitching fielding and stealing pitcher Marvin

2006
04:00:29,879 --> 04:00:36,409
Mute was in marvelous midseason form pitching a true no-hitter and the

2007
04:00:36,409 --> 04:00:43,559
outfield posted another error-free game yeah it certainly didn't help that the

2008
04:00:43,559 --> 04:00:48,959
drunkards played true to form fielding only four semi-sober players against a

2009
04:00:48,959 --> 04:01:00,450
full complement of Mimes at least the drunkards have consistency going for

2010
04:01:00,450 --> 04:01:06,010
them with a record of one win and 39 straight losses their only victory

2011
04:01:06,010 --> 04:01:10,090
resulting from a forfeit on their home opener when the circus were forced to

2012
04:01:10,090 --> 04:01:20,450
forfeit due to their teen bus breaking down on the highway now let's move

2013
04:01:20,450 --> 04:01:24,569
across the country to where the powerful and primal Phoenix cavemen hosted the

2014
04:01:24,569 --> 04:01:30,090
lovely and long in the tooth Ohio old ladies it was yet another epically long

2015
04:01:30,090 --> 04:01:34,370
contest between these teams that we affectionately call beauty and the beast

2016
04:01:34,370 --> 04:01:41,370
the cavemen played true to form meaning all brawn absolutely no brains and the

2017
04:01:41,370 --> 04:01:46,530
old ladies were as always their charming generous selves valuing hospitality

2018
04:01:46,530 --> 04:01:51,110
camaraderie and friendship over competition as they usually do it's

2019
04:01:51,110 --> 04:01:55,389
really a wonder the cavemen survive in the league after so many years of still

2020
04:01:55,389 --> 04:02:00,590
not understanding at all how the game is played but there's no denying that

2021
04:02:00,590 --> 04:02:06,239
hitting is where their strength lies caveman left fielder Thronk and short

2022
04:02:06,239 --> 04:02:11,000
stop Booga currently lead the league in home runs and runs batted in and today's

2023
04:02:11,000 --> 04:02:15,840
game was another eight-hour ordeal with fans certainly getting their money's

2024
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:21,239
worth as both teams had no issues with pace of gameplay yep the fans truly

2025
04:02:21,360 --> 04:02:26,159
appreciate the joy just all around Midwest Ohio niceness the old ladies

2026
04:02:26,159 --> 04:02:30,719
bring to the field every night have you Ohio old ladies are leading the league

2027
04:02:30,719 --> 04:02:37,319
in number of walks and strikeouts due to I say this nicely being very selective

2028
04:02:37,319 --> 04:02:41,079
at the plate also leading the league in number of times telling you you look

2029
04:02:41,079 --> 04:02:45,639
like skin and bones eat something but today fans were treated to a rare bases

2030
04:02:45,639 --> 04:02:50,600
loaded hit by Clara crinoline her hit forced old lady catcher Ethel Laflame

2031
04:02:50,639 --> 04:02:55,600
who was on third base due to a walk and then a block to speed toward home

2032
04:02:55,600 --> 04:03:01,229
unfortunately cavemen designated hitter duty was confused by the base runner and

2033
04:03:01,229 --> 04:03:04,709
mistakenly thought she was heading toward the dugout to steal his turkey

2034
04:03:04,709 --> 04:03:10,469
leg so he left out of the dugout to defend what he saw as his territory good

2035
04:03:10,469 --> 04:03:15,950
news is the umpire awarded Ethel home plate and Clara got her first RBI of

2036
04:03:15,950 --> 04:03:20,469
the season what a moment yeah real team player that Ethel what a spirit and

2037
04:03:20,829 --> 04:03:24,950
what a turkey like yeah the cavemen beat more than just Ethel they beat the

2038
04:03:24,950 --> 04:03:32,879
entire team in a 26 to 1 clubbing all right before we wrap up crunch time we

2039
04:03:32,879 --> 04:03:38,200
have some new details we'd like to share with you surrounding the all out benches

2040
04:03:38,200 --> 04:03:42,079
clearing brawl during the California circus and Maryland magicians game

2041
04:03:42,079 --> 04:03:47,200
today what a mess taking absolute mess you hate to see it the melee of merry

2042
04:03:47,200 --> 04:03:56,159
men as it's already becoming known or Jeremy Albertson did his best to quell

2043
04:03:56,200 --> 04:04:00,440
the two teams but for the history they've got against each other this is

2044
04:04:00,440 --> 04:04:05,280
quite a task a bean for a bean you said it both teams believing they're the

2045
04:04:05,280 --> 04:04:09,680
better but least appreciated entertainers this folly turn fracas

2046
04:04:09,680 --> 04:04:15,000
surpassed all previous skirmishes both benches cleared as did the bullpen and

2047
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:19,399
the locker rooms and it's kind of unfortunate to note here what we're

2048
04:04:19,399 --> 04:04:23,319
learning now the magicians initially charged out of their dugout not with

2049
04:04:23,360 --> 04:04:29,469
any violent intent but seems desperately attempting to escape what looks like an

2050
04:04:29,469 --> 04:04:34,520
animal of some sort that got into their dugout what is that tensions flaring

2051
04:04:34,520 --> 04:04:37,520
that high it's no wonder the circus went right into action but again just

2052
04:04:37,520 --> 04:04:41,920
unfortunate to think of all the kids there too and the animals will soon see

2053
04:04:41,920 --> 04:04:46,159
how the league's going to respond but you have to figure at least a handful of

2054
04:04:46,159 --> 04:04:50,100
suspensions will come out of this debacle but that's all the time we have

2055
04:04:50,100 --> 04:04:54,979
to crunch today we'll be back tomorrow with more league highlights and until

2056
04:04:54,979 --> 04:04:59,260
then I'm Tom Chairman and I'm Dicky Dreck and you've been watching crunch

2057
04:04:59,260 --> 04:04:59,780
time
