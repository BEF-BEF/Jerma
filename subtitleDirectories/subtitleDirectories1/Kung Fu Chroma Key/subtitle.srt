1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:16,339
I look like shit right there. Can I take a better picture? Why is it the same picture?

2
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:26,940
Oh no, I got sucked into the comic book. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come fight me.

3
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,570
Get fucking slapped.

4
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:40,670
Yeah, you want to see how we do a backflip into the devil slap?

5
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:51,100
I got two. I got to fight two of them. Just come closer. Come on.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
I'm just going with the slaps now.

7
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:09,269
Got the kick. Oh, she just kicked me right in the face. What the fuck am I doing by the way?

8
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,269
Why am I like sitting on the ground? Got to use the uppercut.

9
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:20,849
Again with the power punch. I'm not kicking him.

10
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:31,510
Yeah, did you see that kick? Where did I end up? How did I get up here?

11
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:38,189
Alright, how do I get down? Like I got to jump over again, right?

12
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:47,599
Shit. Can I go down like this ladder? I don't think I can go down the ladder.

13
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:58,310
I'm stuck up here. What the fuck? Here we go.

14
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,669
I'm back up here again. What, the boxes?

15
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:17,729
Give me the box. Give me the trash can.

16
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:21,030
Oh, fuck it. I just hit my hand on it.

17
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:31,590
That's what I call the window washer. Get cleaned up.

18
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,259
Who's left? Oh, you? Oh, you? I saved the best for you.

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,849
Shit. This game's fucking hard.

20
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:59,360
Stay low. Dude, look at that. How are you supposed to beat this guy unless you stay low?

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,389
I can't even see what's going on on the screen. All I know is I'm picking his ass.

22
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:09,400
I literally beat him. I beat him. Victory.

23
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:29,060
Can I just say, I'm getting really tired right now.

24
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,539
Because unlike any other game that's like this, I really have to fight these guys.

25
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:39,539
It's not like I have to like pretend punch. I have to really fucking punch these guys.

26
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:45,539
I have to like actually throw swings, you know, and fucking ground pound.

27
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:57,360
Is this how fast I can fucking run?

28
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:10,759
I'm back. This time I'm brandishing a weapon.

29
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:22,569
This lightsaber or $4.52 grocery store Whipple Ball bat is going to help me achieve victory.

30
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,939
Just call me baseball player.

31
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,750
Did I die?

32
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:56,089
Even with a baseball bat, I broke something.

33
00:04:56,089 --> 00:05:01,660
It was a lampshade. Don't worry.

34
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,660
See what I got? Out of here.

35
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,660
See what I got in my hands? It was a ball bat.

36
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,220
Fucking God. I can't use this.

37
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,860
Here we go. Nice and easy.

38
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,170
Just like you're hitting the ball up midfield past the second baseman.

39
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,540
And you can queue up a power attack in a second.

40
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,899
Right when he's at pretty much like low health, we're going to queue up a power swing for a home run.

41
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,470
Here we go. This is what we're going to do. We're going to step into it.

42
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:45,410
We're good. Hey, hey!

43
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,990
This is stupid. This is extremely dangerous.

44
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,990
Like what I'm doing right now could be the dumbest idea I've ever had.

45
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,990
Hey, let me go buy a Whipple Ball bat and like put duct tape all around it so you can see it so I can just break all this shit in my room.

46
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,990
What was I thinking? What was I thinking?

47
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,990
What was I thinking? Seriously, what was I thinking?

48
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,230
I don't even need that weapon.

49
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:15,160
See? I'm actually doing better without the weapon and my shit in my room is intact.

50
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,860
One more.

51
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,170
Shit, I missed. I got him.

52
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,519
What a dumb idea.
