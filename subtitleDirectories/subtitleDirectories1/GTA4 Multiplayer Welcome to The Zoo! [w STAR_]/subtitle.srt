00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,089
Hi, my name is Mr. Traff.

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,420
The herd. Let's go. I can't. I'm like up to the elephant's ass.

3
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:30,899
You're going to change the view a lot.

4
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,740
Let's go find somebody to rough him up.

5
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,460
Let's go rough somebody up. Elephant style.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,899
This guy. This guy.

7
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:51,079
Get him. We can't hit him.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,079
We don't know where my body is. We got him.

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,719
All right, he's dead.

10
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,630
Can we eat the flesh just like elephant do?

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,509
Yes.

12
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:02,759
All right, you hear the one about the two elephants?

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,549
Get in. You're doing the dancing.

14
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:30,090
There are seriously no, I'd love to make a couple of jokes or something, but this is like,

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,329
there is nothing that can be said.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,519
This elephant dance is just perfect. He just leaps over, taps his foot.

17
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,939
Hold on a second. What is this going to look like? Get on this bike.

18
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,540
It's like they dropped like a dead elephant on a bike.

19
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:54,700
All right, let's go.

20
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,140
His butt's so crutched up.

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,700
Let's go.

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait. One more. I got to.

23
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:06,629
Oh, you're the giraffe now?

24
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:11,830
We're zoo pals. Zoo pals make eating fun.

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,949
Oh, zoo pals.

26
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,229
You just disappeared.

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
I love zoo pals. I love animal crackers.

28
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,370
The elephants didn't want anything to do with it.

29
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,169
What the fuck?

30
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,430
Okay. So, oh, look at this one coming down the street.

31
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,509
He's going pretty fast.

32
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,169
I wish he drove through this whole crowd.

33
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,159
Why are they such psychos?

34
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,530
Why aren't these elephants doing anything?

35
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,009
I don't know.

36
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,069
Oh, they'll be back.

37
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,770
No, no.

38
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,289
No, get in.

39
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,159
Later.

40
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,030
All right, I got this elephant.

41
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,150
I'm tracking down an elephant.

42
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,580
Elephant on a bike.

43
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,740
He's going pretty, pretty goddamn fast.

44
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,259
Here he goes. Do you see him?

45
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,979
Oh, you're getting to chase on the elephant.

46
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,139
Oh, I don't want to go that fast.

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,789
Wow. He really is.

48
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,710
He's flooring it.

49
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,710
How is he weaving out of traffic that well?

50
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,289
Probably not that well.

51
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,259
He's all right. He got back on track.

52
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:07,560
He just came out of the fence.

53
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,319
He's more interesting.

54
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,159
The elephant's gone now.

55
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,080
This guy's way more interesting.

56
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,819
Get him. Get him.

57
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,139
Kick his ass.

58
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,540
They all want this one truck.

59
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,100
Who's going to win?

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,439
They are all just fighting over the same car.

61
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,000
They really are.

62
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,110
There's other cars.

63
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,829
You idiots.

64
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,170
I'm trying to push it to get one of them out of here.

65
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,850
As soon as they get thrown out of the car, too,

66
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,089
it's like they don't want to drive anymore.

67
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,850
Yeah. Whoever's the last person that gets in

68
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,290
is the one that's driving.

69
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,680
Oh, maybe not.

70
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,160
I don't know.

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
One out of the herd.

72
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,540
What the fuck are you doing?

73
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,180
You dicks.

74
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,100
What is up with these psychos?

75
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,980
The winner.

76
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,899
Is your feet up the truck?

77
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,060
Oh, I'm passing out.

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,459
Hold on.

79
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,180
Get in.

80
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,899
I can't.

81
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,379
I can't breathe.

82
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,500
Get in.

83
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,980
I can't.

84
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,430
I'm so confused in the city.

85
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,629
Oh, that's a 10-4.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,420
Bye.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,639
Where are you going?

88
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:31,740
I'm just trying to find it.

89
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,699
Can you breathe?

90
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:39,189
I think my game broke.

91
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,620
Yeah, you didn't respond.

92
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,300
What was the movie?

93
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,300
Dumbo Drop?

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,420
What's the movie?

95
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,920
Quick.

96
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,019
What's the name of that fucking movie?

97
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:57,620
It's Dumbo Drop, Dumbo Drop and Disconnected.
