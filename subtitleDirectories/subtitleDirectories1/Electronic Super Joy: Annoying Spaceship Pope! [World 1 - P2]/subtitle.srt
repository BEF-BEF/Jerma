1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:18,859
Let's just go. Forget waiting for anything, man. Just move. Missiles, you know, screw

2
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,019
the missiles. Take them out when you can take them out and just move up the friggin' tower.

3
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,839
See the missiles are way far behind now. Stay ahead of the missiles. And then you can just

4
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:43,570
double smash them like... Oh! I thought that was a good plan. Turned out it was a pretty

5
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:52,399
bad plan. Don't make the screen go that far up. Just do it nice and gently. No, I did

6
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:09,519
it again. I did it again. Stop doing that. There we go. Okay. Mother. God. Please make

7
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:19,269
it. What does this asshole have to say now? Don't waste time. Stop floating around. Stomp

8
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:36,170
on those missiles. Okay, I can't touch those without doing the stomp. I'll be fine. Jump

9
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:46,510
up the sticky chamber. Perfect. All right. Where am I? That might be too risky to try

10
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,129
to get. I think that might be a little too risky. I never said I was going to gold star

11
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:56,530
every level. I never said that. Nobody can quote me on that. All I said I was going to

12
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,489
beat the game in like 10 minutes and it's been like probably 40. I don't even know how

13
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:15,569
long it's been. I'm just getting spammed with missiles right now. Look at all this nonsense.

14
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:27,409
I got to sit up for this. Sit up straight. Got to clear them before they become too out

15
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:46,120
of control. That's the theory. God. This is going to be a pain in the ass, man. These

16
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:57,750
missiles are going to be a thing for the rest of the game. I can already tell. Get out of

17
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:13,099
my face. Get away from me. I got the checkpoint. That's all that matters. I've got to stop

18
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:25,849
doing that. Why do they have to jump? Why do those things have to jump? Is there a reason

19
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:35,939
why they have to be jumping? Don't break your keyboard. What are you, Star? I only have

20
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,020
like one keyboard. I can't like afford to smash it into the ground. I'm not even using

21
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:47,169
a keyboard. I'm using a controller. Playing this game on a keyboard would be awful. It

22
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,699
would be mind-melting how hard this would be on a controller. This is not even that

23
00:03:51,699 --> 00:04:09,469
difficult. I just need to slow down and stop being such a psychopath. I'm getting this

24
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:15,969
right now. Get out of here, you giant like fucking wildebeest. Did I touch the flag?

25
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:31,339
I touched the flag, right? I did. Good. Thank God. Let's get the hell out of here. Another

26
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:47,360
flag. Don't even destroy those. They're just to mess with you. That's the only reason why

27
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,759
these missiles are even here in this level. Just to mess with you. They're going a little

28
00:04:50,759 --> 00:05:03,589
bit too fast. I did it. Hooray. The Pope. What did that say about the Pope? The Pope

29
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:14,420
has gone insane. That's too bad. Or been mind-controlled. Anyway, he wants to kill you. Pope wants to

30
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,790
kill me now. Guess you'll have to murder him. Oh well. So I gotta go kill the Pope? That's

31
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:37,029
the Pope? What's the Pope doing in this weird world? So I gotta go kill the Pope. Howdy.

32
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:48,509
Hi Pope. I'm the Pope. And I'm gonna fuck you up. Wow. Pope-tastic. What a dick. Is

33
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:59,420
this a boss fight? Alright, let's go. You think this is a spaceship? Alright, Pope.

34
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:10,730
You asked for it. I didn't know that was gonna be a thing. Okay. Here we go. Go. Oh man,

35
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:18,519
this is gonna be hard. This is gonna be hard. That dumbass screen shake at the very beginning

36
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:25,149
is really messing me up. Hey, what's like shake your screen? Like, look at violently

37
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:35,680
for like a second of... Whoa. I pulled that out of my ass. I like looked away from this.

38
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:51,750
This is... I don't even know about this one, guys. I don't know about this one. Fuck! I'm

39
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:58,230
doing something wrong. I'm going the wrong way. This is a bad route. I gotta beat him

40
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,810
up there. Let's go. There we go. Okay. Keep it going. I have to be way in front of all

41
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:22,209
that. Bull crap. No checkpoint flags. I don't see any checkpoint flags, by the way. Alright.

42
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:28,579
That was it. We built a spaceship. Jump in. Is this gonna turn into like a side-scrolling

43
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:37,300
shooter? Oh wow. It really is. This really is like a side... I can't believe it. That's

44
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:51,089
what this is. This thing handles like a slug. I can't move at all. Wow. Come on. You're

45
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,569
gonna turn this into like a bullet hell game? Are you kidding me right now? You've gotta

46
00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:03,250
be fucking kidding me. You've got to be kidding me. Stay as far back as you can get and just...

47
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,449
I'm just tapping A right now and just weaving. That's all I'm gonna be doing. I'm just looking

48
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:16,230
at the bullet hell. Is that... Come on. He's almost got the shield down. Get rid of that

49
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:34,049
shield. Shield gone. Hit him. Good. Alright. Out of gas. Oh well. What the hell is that?

50
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:42,730
What the hell is that? I have a rocket launcher. Oh, alright. Yeah. Nice. Shoot him. Shoot this...

51
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,059
This is gonna be... This is gonna be a cake, man. I'm just gonna shoot this... Just shoot

52
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,490
him like probably like five times. Complete the level. Shoot the rainbow launcher at him.

53
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:58,250
Kill this mother... I can't call the pope a mother effer. That's not right. Kill this

54
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:11,129
bad guy. The pope. So he does a laser. He does rockets. You cannot get hit by the trail of

55
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:27,169
the rockets. Oh damn. Okay. I gotta go activate this one over here. Man. Just do it one right

56
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:40,289
after the other. See if I can... Fuck. This is starting to really irritate me. Can those

57
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,679
hit me? Hopefully... Too much stuff is going on on the screen at one time. I can't even...

58
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:58,799
I don't even know what's happening half the time. This rainbow colored nonsense is...

59
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,139
This is fucking ridiculous. Alright. Get it off. Get two off. He's gonna do the... There

60
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:15,259
we go. Laser. Three. There's the third one. Please arc over and hit him. Nice. That's

61
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:41,460
exactly what I needed right there. What is this? What? This might be the most swears

62
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:49,500
I've ever said in a video series ever. I probably have like sweared or swore like 60 times.

63
00:10:49,500 --> 00:11:01,139
Oh, you want to like have a video where you like say swears like 75 times? Okay, great.

64
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:09,379
You know what? It's these... Is this like the last boss or is this like the first boss?

65
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:15,960
I have no idea. It's gonna be one of those things. It's either the first boss or the

66
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:23,210
last boss. And if this is the first boss, then my life is just gonna be over. I'm like...

67
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,970
My voice is getting all cracked up. I'm being quiet. I'm being totally silent to make this

68
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:50,860
happen. There we go. Please screw that up. I've been sitting here for so long trying

69
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:58,799
to beat this goddamn boss. Honest to God. This is just... This is just dumb. This is

70
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:07,019
just dumb, alright? You don't... See, I can handle this part. This part's not the big...

71
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,659
The problem. The problem is this part. Once it gets like the quad laser out, and then

72
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,620
you can't even like... You can't even do anything. Like I'm stuck in between these lasers and

73
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:28,100
he spins. So I'm like so screwed. And he's gonna shoot more rockets. What? Oh, he stopped.

74
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,860
He stopped doing it. Alright. I didn't... I had no idea that he did that. Don't do the

75
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:46,740
quad laser again, please. Is he dead? He's dead. Did I do it? Oh my God, I did it. I

76
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:56,570
did it. I actually did it. I'm so mad at you. Oh no. That was it? I just killed him. Okay.

77
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:02,850
You killed the pope. Congratulations. Dibs on his hat. Dibs on being the next pope. Dammit.

78
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:10,029
I wanted that. Anyway, good job. The game's not even close to being over.
