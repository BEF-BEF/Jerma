1
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:01,960
What's up?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,490
I guess Kimmel didn't do much for him.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,259
Will you guys stop saying the words Jimmy and Kimmel right next to each other?

4
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:23,359
What do you mean? Of course somebody said it. I just read it.

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,550
Oh, he uses Reddit. Alright, easy. Fuckin' loser.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:01:05,750
Give me one sec. Sorry, I just had to tweet about it.

7
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:13,569
Guys, I get like... I get like 200 plus people instantly from Twitter.

8
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:18,510
I have to tweet it. Sometimes 400.

9
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,480
Why are you laughing?

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,180
I guess I'm laughing too. We're both laughing.

11
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,209
What are we doing today? A couple of things.

12
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,090
Continuing our just grab bag week.

13
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,090
Just pulling games out of a hat.

14
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,780
Because we've got a whole plan.

15
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,950
Next week and the week after that.

16
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,219
Jobby Bunny is tomorrow.

17
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,549
If you are wondering.

18
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:54,920
As well as Hive Mind.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Which is something I've been looking forward to playing for a pretty long time actually.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,859
Hive Mind is a game that was made by somebody in the community.

21
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,359
It is a family feud game.

22
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,919
That we can play.

23
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,919
Where I have to essentially kind of guess what you think.

24
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,919
What I think your answers are going to be.

25
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,210
He's been working on it for a while. We're probably going to do it tomorrow.

26
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,830
And Jobby Bunny is tomorrow too.

27
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:28,300
Remember when you promised Jobby Bunny?

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I just gave you a date. I just gave you a hard date. It's tomorrow.

29
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,199
Am I going to revisit Phasmophobia?

30
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,569
I don't know. Maybe.

31
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,699
I think the right amount of lightning needs to strike.

32
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,699
For four people to be ready in VR.

33
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,710
To play that game.

34
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,710
I was the guy that didn't have VR.

35
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:56,020
You said that you would eat an egg.

36
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
What egg?

37
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,000
We're doing face cam today? No. Face cam tomorrow.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,139
Fix your VR.

39
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,699
Should we tell him?

40
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,699
Should we tell him that I streamed VR for like two weeks?

41
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:22,250
Don't tell that person that I already streamed VR for like two weeks.

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,250
Alright. Let me clear my throat off.

43
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:34,210
Why is there a slug emote?

44
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,210
I added Jerma Slug Pug and everyone was really mad at me.

45
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,639
But now I'm in that weird awful place.

46
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,639
Where half of the people that use that emote.

47
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,639
That think it's really funny.

48
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,639
They love that shit.

49
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,639
But then the other half of you that almost throw up in your mouth when you see it.

50
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,639
And that you want to delete it from the internet.

51
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,639
Now I've got half of you that say that too.

52
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,639
So now I've got to deal with both of the sides here.

53
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,639
That are like, we want slug pug. We don't want slug pug.

54
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:06,219
Then at that point it comes down to what I want, right?

55
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,219
And here's what I want.

56
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:11,939
Chaos.

57
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,939
So it's working perfectly.

58
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,569
Alright, let's play. We're gonna play a couple of games.

59
00:04:16,569 --> 00:04:22,430
Oh my god, what's going on today?

60
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:33,230
Oh, what the fuck?

61
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,500
Okay. What's happening?

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,019
I can't get it out. I can't stop it.

63
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,019
Is it gone? Okay, it's gone.

64
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,019
I don't smoke.

65
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,379
I'm dry of water. I swear to god.

66
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,379
I'm just fucking over 30.

67
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:54,519
How come 35 is the new 60? This is bullshit.

68
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:58,980
Anyways, we're gonna start with streamer life simulator.

69
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Before you freak out, before you throw a rock at me.

70
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,860
Just hold on.

71
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,420
Listen, I'm not gonna play this all day.

72
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,420
I'm gonna play Exanima.

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Exanima? Right? Yeah.

74
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Exanima is a physics based top down dungeon crawler.

75
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:22,019
I made a video on this fucking game like seven years ago.

76
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,019
And I was told, it was recommended to me again.

77
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:27,019
They said, hey dude, so much shit has been added to this game.

78
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:30,019
And it's way different and way better than when you played it before.

79
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:34,019
It was a little wonky before. It was like alpha or something.

80
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,019
Play it now, please. You'll love it.

81
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,019
So I'm like, alright man.

82
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:42,389
I guess the actual 1.0 came out and they updated it a bunch of times.

83
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,389
So I'm gonna give it a try. We'll try it again today.

84
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,449
But that is before.

85
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,879
That is after we're gonna play streamer life simulator.

86
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,769
This was also recommended too.

87
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,769
And if you don't think I pull from the recommended channel on the discord,

88
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,769
then where are these two games coming from?

89
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:12,529
The only reason why I want to play this, one reason,

90
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:14,529
there's only one single solitary reason,

91
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,529
is because you play a game in the game to a fake audience.

92
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,529
And like that, I don't know why that's funny to me.

93
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,529
Is this a cringe game? I don't know what that means.

94
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,529
What does that even mean?

95
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:32,579
I don't even know what that means.

96
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,579
Look, I already have my settings ready.

97
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,139
We make a character.

98
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:42,579
Alright, let's put clothes on this person first of all.

99
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:49,620
Porn game?

100
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,250
It's perfect.

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,370
It is not perfect.

102
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,120
Is this just the character? Do I even care?

103
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
I'm being honest.

104
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

105
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
There's facial morphing?

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,379
Low cheek posit? What is this doing?

107
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,379
Oh, hold on, this is face morphing.

108
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,620
What's with the camera?

109
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
The camera's freaking me out, man.

110
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,850
Okay, that's a little much, but whatever.

111
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,649
Is this Chad?

112
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,740
Hey, what do you mean?

113
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,689
This is me.

114
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,689
Ear position? Why does this even matter?

115
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:53,379
I'm just making golem.

116
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,379
Eyes. My eyes kind of go like this a little bit.

117
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,379
Do they? I don't know, I can't turn the camera on.

118
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,620
I don't have any clothes on.

119
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
I have big eyes. I have big scary eyes.

120
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
They're like this.

121
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,920
I've been told that before.

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
You know that your actual eyeballs are kind of fucking huge?

123
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,189
No, I don't have that.

124
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,189
Maybe a little bit, maybe like that.

125
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,420
Forehead size?

126
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,420
I have big eyebrow hinges, whatever these are called.

127
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,300
I don't have a big forehead though.

128
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,580
My forehead's actually pretty small.

129
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,139
I have a small head.

130
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,399
It's not tiny though, it's pretty narrow.

131
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,019
I can get a better image.

132
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:46,580
Jaw position?

133
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,450
Okay, this does not look like me.

134
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,980
You look like Pinhead.

135
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:07,379
It doesn't matter.

136
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,460
I kind of have a big nose.

137
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,980
It's not really big, it's just warped.

138
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,269
It's not, I don't have a big nose.

139
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,269
I have a warped nose. This is different.

140
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:25,269
People miss get through that all the time.

141
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,830
Oh, he's got a big nose.

142
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,830
No, no, no, no. It's just crooked at the top and broken and twisted.

143
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,909
It just looks bigger.

144
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,980
Okay, that's fine.

145
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,220
I can actually be glue man?

146
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,240
No, no.

147
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,820
No, no, no.

148
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,059
You make slime guy.

149
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,059
Why are all these things in the game?

150
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,159
What's the point of this?

151
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,159
Arm width.

152
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,159
Huge arms.

153
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,539
No, I have long arms.

154
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:14,190
I got that big ant stomach now.

155
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,190
This is 6'7".

156
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,190
6'6", 6'5", 6'4".

157
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,190
I don't even know.

158
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,899
What height is this?

159
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:25,899
0.5?

160
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:27,899
Neck thickness.

161
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,899
I like cartoon pythons

162
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,899
swallowed a plate or something.

163
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,940
My character right now is going like

164
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:42,159
And then the other secondary character comes over

165
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,159
and punches me in the stomach

166
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,159
and the whole plate comes out.

167
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,159
And the turkey dinner on it too and I eat it and it's normal.

168
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,139
Let's do normal.

169
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,659
Feet size.

170
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:03,820
Forearm length.

171
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
I get it.

172
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,659
I understand.

173
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,659
Leg separation.

174
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,840
You know what?

175
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I do have pretty big leg separation, don't I?

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,450
I have short legs.

177
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,450
The long thing is

178
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,450
I would be so much shorter

179
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,450
if I had a shorter torso.

180
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,750
I actually have

181
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,750
an alien body.

182
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
I have a really long torso, but short legs.

183
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
If I had a short torso, I'd be 5'4".

184
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:42,370
So you're compact.

185
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,190
Kind of.

186
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:55,220
I'm like an accordion.

187
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,360
Upper muscle.

188
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,049
Upper weight. A little bit heavy.

189
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,049
This looks nothing like me.

190
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:07,179
This is just a weird guy.

191
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,679
No eyebrows.

192
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,009
Style 1. Style 2.

193
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,009
Style 3.

194
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,129
They're kind of like this.

195
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,129
Eyes. Cat eyes.

196
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,129
Alligator eyes.

197
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:29,549
Oh, there we go.

198
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,549
My eyes are like a slate gray.

199
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,919
I don't have blue eyes.

200
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,539
I have a slate gray.

201
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,039
Cool.

202
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,080
That looks good. What about hair?

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm going to keep it bald for all of you to laugh.

204
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,860
I like this look.

205
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,679
No shoes.

206
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,500
Elf ears?

207
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:16,460
This is good.

208
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,460
This doesn't look anything like me.

209
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,919
You just said the F word, dude.

210
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,919
What do you want me to do?

211
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,500
I don't know.

212
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm too.

213
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,409
Hold on a second here.

214
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:37,250
This is not even correct.

215
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,610
Now it's a little more correct.

216
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,860
There we go. I'm ready.

217
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,860
Streamer life, the first installation may take a little longer.

218
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,860
You can find some items to sell.

219
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,289
You buy gas?

220
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,289
You drive a car?

221
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,659
Does this get an automatic plus one?

222
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,830
Plus A? Plus a letter grade?

223
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:07,809
What do I do?

224
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,820
Press the up arrow on the keyboard to open the phone.

225
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,700
Welcome.

226
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,889
Okay, turn it off.

227
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:23,730
Talk to Mosi.

228
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,730
Is this a drug dealer simulator?

229
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,700
Hygiene? Toilet? Heat?

230
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,600
Messages. Settings.

231
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,950
Sound. Alarm. Car assistance.

232
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,950
Turn the overturned car

233
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,240
back to normal.

234
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,309
Spoiler. Thanks.

235
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,309
Zuber. Select the location you want to go.

236
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:52,830
Oh, it's like Uber.

237
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,830
Health. Current weight 83 pounds.

238
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,830
Calories consumed.

239
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,779
Recommended calories. Flashlight?

240
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:03,549
Okay.

241
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:06,690
What the fuck is this game?

242
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,419
The computer parts in the trunk of the car.

243
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,159
Can I pet the dog?

244
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,340
How do you pet dog?

245
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Do I have to just go home?

246
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,860
Talk to Mosi. Put the computer parts in and go home.

247
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,620
What the fuck?

248
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:37,600
What is going on?

249
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
What is this drug dealer simulator?

250
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:48,820
But it's a different video game.

251
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,490
I thought it was a streamer.

252
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,370
I thought it was a streamer simulator.

253
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,080
What happened last night?

254
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,080
I can't explain right now. I'm about to faint.

255
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
What's going on? Money?

256
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
I said buy a computer to pay me your debt.

257
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,200
The computer is in front of the door.

258
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,039
Now fuck off.

259
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,350
Okay.

260
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,350
Press E to get it in your hand.

261
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,350
What? X47?

262
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,350
This is a real motherboard.

263
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,629
Isn't that a real motherboard?

264
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,629
Press E to get it in your hand.

265
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,919
Press and hold to put it in the bag.

266
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,919
Okay. Why do all motherboards have the exact same name then?

267
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,179
How do I put a legendary monitor?

268
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,179
Why does it have rarity?

269
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,129
Old case.

270
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:53,379
Oh my god. What is all this?

271
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,700
Do I have to build a computer?

272
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,350
The Samsung 03.

273
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,350
That's a great way to not get sued.

274
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,349
You've done a great job. I can't carry any more items.

275
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:13,490
What? Where the hell do we live?

276
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,609
This is a potato PC.

277
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,490
What are you talking about dude?

278
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,490
Alright.

279
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,240
No it's not.

280
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,539
We didn't even get a good look at it.

281
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:30,980
Alright. I have $814.

282
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Pretty sick. Alright. Wait. What happened to my...

283
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,950
Put this in there too.

284
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,259
Durability. Socket.

285
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,259
You build PCs in this game?

286
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:52,880
Wait. I want all this stuff.

287
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Zintel.

288
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
You put a Z in front of every single word.

289
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
Zorsair. Zintel.

290
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,569
Zinvidia.

291
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:07,309
Alright. Okay. Let's go.

292
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,309
Okay. I have to be fair to the game.

293
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:11,869
I do. This is plus one full letter grade.

294
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:14,619
It is.

295
00:18:14,619 --> 00:18:17,569
This is not just a...

296
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:25,869
How do I drive?

297
00:18:25,869 --> 00:18:27,869
W and S is forward and back.

298
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,480
It's not doing anything.

299
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,170
Handbrake? Oh the handbrake was on.

300
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,369
This car sucks.

301
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:42,130
But it does get...

302
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,130
It does get a full letter grade.

303
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,130
I have to be fair to video games.

304
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,890
This is Silent Hill.

305
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,890
This game is actually creeping me the

306
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:02,460
fuck out a little.

307
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,460
That sound is in 3D Movie Maker.

308
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
That's in 3D Movie Maker. It's one of the car hit sounds.

309
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:15,740
So where's my house?

310
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,819
Holy shit. There are people.

311
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:30,079
Alright. Get out.

312
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,660
I can't do this while the car is moving.

313
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,910
How do I get out of the car?

314
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,920
Exit the vehicle.

315
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:57,259
Okay. How do I stream?

316
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:10,960
This is my streamer room?

317
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,950
Press to get in your...

318
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,950
Oh no. I have to decorate my streamer room.

319
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,819
You live in the Postal 2 universe.

320
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,819
Apparently.

321
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,380
How do I...

322
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,960
Cool. Okay.

323
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,349
Set up and run your computer.

324
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:37,549
What? Alright.

325
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:43,309
This is the streamer room right here, right?

326
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,619
Is this a high chair?

327
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:53,549
Alright. I need a desk.

328
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,299
Fuck. That's not very good.

329
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,930
Plastic chair.

330
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay. I need my...

331
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,099
This is a shelf. Let's just like clean this

332
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,549
place up a little.

333
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,549
Has it enough wallpaper on the walls or anything?

334
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,779
There's no drywall on here.

335
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,170
Credit shelf. That's pretty pog. Yep.

336
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,609
Okay. This is my bed.

337
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:24,609
I'm gonna just say this is my bedroom.

338
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:29,789
Oh. That's how you rotate. Rotate. Okay.

339
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:35,230
Cool. Oh. You can sleep.

340
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,140
I need to get... This is my streamer room.

341
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
Wait. No. It's not. This is like... People can just

342
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,759
crawl in here. People can just reach over

343
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,759
and just grab my fucking mouse.

344
00:21:45,759 --> 00:22:00,450
Whatever. How do I leave?

345
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,450
Oh shit. I have so much stuff.

346
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,299
Okay. I need this.

347
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,900
I need this. I need this.

348
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,559
Alright. Let's go. What is he doing?

349
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,819
What do you mean?

350
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:25,660
Oh shit.

351
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,029
That wasn't me putting it in my hand?

352
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:31,099
No. That was. That was right.

353
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:41,089
You guys just got it in my head.

354
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:45,099
Okay. Put this on the table.

355
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,750
Now. How do I get my backpack?

356
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,210
How do I open up my actual backpack?

357
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,210
You should do... You should do your

358
00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:00,720
toilet. What?

359
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,730
Z? Move the desk.

360
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,250
How do I get my backpack?

361
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,460
You can turn the character's features.

362
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
Okay.

363
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,700
That's not controls.

364
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,009
Okay. I. You can open up

365
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,009
the streamer skill panel. Okay. So I.

366
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:32,269
Here we go. Close that.

367
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,579
And put this right here.

368
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,500
That's the motherboard.

369
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
And then I got my

370
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:48,019
desktop PC. Rotate

371
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:52,369
this. Okay. Whoa!

372
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:56,079
Wait. The computer's already done?

373
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,960
Is this an iMac from

374
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,289
2001?

375
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:04,289
Do you remember those things? Those things were fucking awesome.

376
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,809
Um. Okay.

377
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,710
Press F to access computer.

378
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,710
Oh. Okay. Okay. It says I got a chair.

379
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,710
I need the tower. I need the keyboard.

380
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,950
I should do my toilet urgently.

381
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,920
What the fuck does that even mean?

382
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I should do my toilet

383
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
urgently. How do I get up?

384
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,759
How do I get off the computer? Q.

385
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,509
Okay. Where's the bathroom? I don't even have a bathroom.

386
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:39,410
I don't have a bathroom. In the corner.

387
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,420
You should do. I don't know.

388
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,660
I don't know how to do that. Streamer.

389
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:56,049
Is it a skill? What the fuck?

390
00:24:56,049 --> 00:25:01,019
What? What is

391
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:03,019
all this? Make stream and get

392
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:11,339
a stream crown. Open extra

393
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:14,289
slots. Where's the P

394
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:18,579
skill? F.

395
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:25,339
It's not F. I don't think. I don't

396
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:30,400
think I can go to the bathroom. Buy

397
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
a toilet. Well hold on. Wait. Wait.

398
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Alright. Buy a toilet. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. Okay.

399
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,539
Hold on. I need my case.

400
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:42,960
And the keyboard and I'm good.

401
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Close this shit up. Okay. Put this

402
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
down here. That's actually where my

403
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,329
PC is right now.

404
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:51,329
I'm actually going to make this my streamer room.

405
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,000
What's wrong with it? Why is there an exclamation point?

406
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,079
Okay. Keyboard. Go to the bathroom.

407
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,079
I don't know how.

408
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:04,079
That's kind of weird to say.

409
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,940
There we go. Alright. Computer's done.

410
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,940
It's not. Set up and run your computer. What the?

411
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
How do I? Okay. Where are the cables?

412
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,299
Are there any cords? Oh

413
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:22,299
my god. Okay.

414
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:31,579
Um. I need a motherboard.

415
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:33,579
So it's right there. Good thing I

416
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,579
have to go drive back to that dude's house.

417
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,359
Okay. Close this. Get out

418
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,359
of this. Get out of this. How do I close this? Out.

419
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:46,849
Out. Get out.

420
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:52,079
Get out. How do I get out?

421
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,900
Oh. It's escape.

422
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Okay. I have to go get parts. Motherboard.

423
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,690
Put it in here. Motherboard.

424
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,829
There it is. Put it in.

425
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:09,200
Got it. Alright. Now we need a CPU.

426
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,529
We need a video card in a hard drive.

427
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:28,849
Alright. I'll be back. The keyboard was really

428
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,660
preventing me from leaving the house. Alright.

429
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,900
I gotta go back to that guy's house and get my stuff.

430
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,339
Anything in the dumpster? Nope.

431
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,970
Ice cream? How much money do I have?

432
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,579
I don't want to do this.

433
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,579
Why is there an ice cream vendor just right outside of my

434
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:57,329
house? Alright. I need to

435
00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:00,720
go back to that guy's house. Do not

436
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:15,700
hit anybody. Don't hit anybody.

437
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
I already have it in the trunk?

438
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,420
Do I? I don't have a video card.

439
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:29,900
Oh. This is a video

440
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,079
card. Okay. Video card, hard

441
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,079
drive. Oh. I do have it all.

442
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,079
Holy shit. I took all the right stuff. I didn't

443
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,079
leave. Oh. Awesome.

444
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,859
Alright. Let's go back. Oh. I can't wait

445
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,859
to turn up my stream for the first time.

446
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:56,579
Hard drive. Is it an SSD?

447
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,099
Is it the graphics card?

448
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:02,099
Is it the CPU?

449
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,880
And here's the RAM. Let's go.

450
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,059
Let's go. My first stream.

451
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,420
I'm gonna open up a bunch of fucking

452
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,579
Fortnite boxes. No.

453
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:18,960
Here we go. Boot it up.

454
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,839
Turn it on. What's wrong with it?

455
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,000
Open up the phone. Uncheck

456
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,039
first house from map app.

457
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,279
Click to enlarge the map.

458
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,279
Oh my. This is a coin game. Okay.

459
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
House one. House two. House pizza. Taxi.

460
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,859
Waiter. Pet shop.

461
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,170
Okay.

462
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:58,339
Cat shop.

463
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,339
Oh. Okay.

464
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,339
That was fun. I unchecked it.

465
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,089
How do I turn the computer on?

466
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:07,089
Register on the Blender website?

467
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:10,420
What's wrong with the keyboard? Go to

468
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,420
the club. I'm not going to the club right now.

469
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,420
I'm busy. I'm trying to set up my first fucking

470
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,380
Fortnite stream. God if I only knew

471
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
that I was going to play this today. Fuck me.

472
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:26,380
Shit.

473
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
I would have recorded a fucking full video

474
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,380
of like me streaming Fortnite.

475
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,819
And like when I zoomed in to like start

476
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:34,819
the stream I would just play the video. God damn it.

477
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:42,049
What the fuck am I thinking?

478
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:50,180
Turn it on. Am I doing something wrong?

479
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,990
I need to eat food.

480
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,990
I tried to buy an ice cream. It didn't let me.

481
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,190
A case? What's wrong with it?

482
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,190
Oh.

483
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:07,470
This thing is slow.

484
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,839
Protecting flash. Generic.

485
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,720
Welcome. To

486
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
stomach growling noises.

487
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
What the hell is that opening sound?

488
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,819
This computer sucks.

489
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,119
You're not my type.

490
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,700
What is this?

491
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,000
Stream calendar?

492
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,660
Let's see by internet speed. It's pretty bad.

493
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,660
It's really bad. I'm going to have to do

494
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
soar enough.

495
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,710
Alright. Let's see how good my

496
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,710
upload and download is.

497
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,589
Yeah. It's pretty bad.

498
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,589
You can't stream with a connection that's

499
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,920
this bad. You can't stream.

500
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
You can't stream at like 400k

501
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
up. It doesn't work.

502
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,059
Even Hearthstone would look bad

503
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,579
at that setting. What's wrong with me?

504
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:14,349
Okay. Register on the blender.

505
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,349
Can I change the background? I want to make it like

506
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,349
carnage or venom or something. Not this.

507
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:26,210
Alright. Let's go back. You have to eat.

508
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,210
Well, what am I supposed to do?

509
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,559
Can I order food? Oh no.

510
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,509
Scratch. Food shop.

511
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,069
See? Okay. I'm going to get delivery.

512
00:32:39,069 --> 00:32:45,920
Zone hub or coward?

513
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,349
I'm not a coward. I mean, I'm going to

514
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:50,349
blank out the screen to make sure there's no like

515
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:52,349
naked people. Alright. Banana split.

516
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:56,319
Burritos. Croissant.

517
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,940
Alright. Let's get a burrito.

518
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,400
My cart. Burrito dish. Complete

519
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
payment. Alright. Where is it?

520
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,299
We will deliver your order to your home as soon as

521
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:10,299
possible. Our courier will ring your bell when it reaches

522
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,299
your address. Due to some problems, we can only accept online

523
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,480
payments. Alright. Well, we'll hurry up.

524
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,940
I have to buy a toilet?

525
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:27,470
Zoo tube.

526
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,799
Where do you buy taxes?

527
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,829
What the fuck?

528
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,829
Oh my god. I thought that was in real

529
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:38,829
life that scared the shit out of me.

530
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:40,829
I was like, who's here? Why are you here?

531
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,829
Alright. Hold on. I got to get off the computer.

532
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,970
Oh, too real, man. Too real.

533
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,970
Make it something goofy.

534
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,069
Okay. Yes, I'm here.

535
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:56,589
Oh, ugh.

536
00:33:56,589 --> 00:33:59,660
Alright. Thank you. Didn't even put it

537
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
in a bag. Worst

538
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,990
fucking Uber Eats driver.

539
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:10,880
Okay. Eat. Okay. How am I doing?

540
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I need to go to the bathroom.

541
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:24,269
You ate the plate, too. Yeah.

542
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:27,150
I should do my toilet urgent.

543
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,150
I don't have a toilet, man. You keep saying that.

544
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:36,369
What the fuck just happened?

545
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:39,699
Alright. Turn the computer on.

546
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,699
Do you have people walking by this window?

547
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:45,219
Hey, Klawski. Thanks for the

548
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,219
10 community subs. Appreciate it.

549
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:54,320
Move your desk, please.

550
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,969
Find a toilet. I'm going to have to

551
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:05,139
buy one. There's an outside

552
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,139
outhouse. Is there really?

553
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,809
Alright. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

554
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:16,719
Ooh. What the fuck?

555
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:24,449
Outhouse. Where is it?

556
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:28,480
Do you know where the bathroom is?

557
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Where's the bathroom? I need a bathroom.

558
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,170
Excuse me, sir.

559
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,920
Do you know where I can find a bathroom?

560
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,949
You scares me. Do you know where I can find a bathroom?

561
00:35:39,949 --> 00:35:46,860
There is no outhouse.

562
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:56,900
Joe Biden?

563
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,900
Ooh. Bathroom. Bathroom.

564
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,719
You got a bathroom in here?

565
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,010
Shit. Wait. You can buy stuff?

566
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,010
This is like a computer place.

567
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,079
Isn't this the guy that sells ice cream?

568
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:20,829
Uh, I'll be back.

569
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:24,219
Why are there no toilets?

570
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,219
Thank you, Sakamoto, for the 10 community subs.

571
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,059
Where's my house?

572
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:38,699
I have to buy a toilet. That's the only way

573
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,940
this is going to work. Thanks for the subs though, really.

574
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:51,170
Okay. Wait, I didn't turn

575
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,170
it off. I didn't turn it off. I didn't turn it off. Why didn't I turn it off?

576
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,170
Oh, my stream deck's wrong.

577
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,340
My stream deck's wrong. There we go.

578
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:16,079
180

579
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,650
bucks. Wow,

580
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,949
dude. You don't

581
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:25,949
$180 a month?

582
00:37:25,949 --> 00:37:29,469
Let's go, boys. No.

583
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:33,760
Let's not go. Job King.

584
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:43,489
I have to go to the Blender. Wait, wait.

585
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:45,489
No, no, no. Fuck this. We're going to Blender.

586
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:48,500
Whatever the hell that is. I think that's a

587
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:58,219
dig at Mixer.

588
00:37:58,219 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm going to take a shit. I need to buy a better

589
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
internet. This internet's so bad.

590
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
This is triggering such a response

591
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,030
in me. How many times have you been sitting

592
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,030
there with like your phone or like a device

593
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,030
and it just does that and you just rage?

594
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,400
942

595
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
thousand people are watching streams right now.

596
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:26,530
Okay. Wait, am I on here?

597
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,340
I mean, is Zerma

598
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
on here? Is Zerma on here? Is Zerma

599
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
985 on here? Let's find out. Come on.

600
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:41,010
Come on. It's a

601
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,010
play on like all streamers.

602
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,019
I got to be on here. Come on, dude.

603
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:49,019
Let me see.

604
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:51,389
I'm not important enough.

605
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:57,219
Alright, so let's watch

606
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,219
what game is this? The thing, The Witcher?

607
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:06,769
Everybody's at the same

608
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:08,769
part of The Witcher 3.

609
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:13,250
You all started your

610
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,250
streams at the exact same time on launch

611
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,579
day. Okay, well,

612
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:21,329
register. Enter. Oh, okay.

613
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:32,000
Registration complete.

614
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I have to scan my finger print.

615
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,460
Alright.

616
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,260
Here comes Zerma. Login.

617
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,340
Zerma.

618
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Do I have to start my stream? Become a

619
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
partner. I have to stream for a while

620
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,309
first, don't I? Dashboard

621
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:59,309
followers. That's my stream key.

622
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:03,860
That would be so bad if that was how it

623
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,780
actually worked. Can you imagine if

624
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,150
it was only four digits?

625
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,150
You would be able to just guess half of the

626
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,219
people's accounts. Okay, advertising

627
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:18,219
revenue. Lenders share. Seventy percent.

628
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,219
Expected earnings. Subscription goal.

629
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,219
Average live viewer is zero.

630
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:26,260
Alright, let's...

631
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
I should do my toilet. That's not important.

632
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Ad duration. No, no, no. No ads.

633
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
No ads in the very beginning. Stream name.

634
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,940
That's stream one. That's not going to bring any eyeballs.

635
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:46,269
Right? Like, aces only.

636
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:51,389
How do I stream?

637
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:55,039
Free subscription to one streamer.

638
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,369
Special in-game loot.

639
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:03,099
Get free games every month.

640
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:05,860
How do I stream? Become a

641
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
partner. Get invited to special streamer

642
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
events organized by Blender.

643
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Okay. Blender shares drop by

644
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,159
fifteen percent. Faster Blender

645
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:16,159
support. Chance to join streamers

646
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,190
recommended by Blender. Oh, I need to have

647
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,190
four hundred live active viewers and

648
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:26,849
a hundred subs. Oh.

649
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,849
Well. Download the OPS

650
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:30,849
program from the app's website.

651
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:32,849
Why is this way more detailed than I thought it was going to be?

652
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:39,500
Apps? Go get the OBS.

653
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,369
Buy a microphone.

654
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,369
Send all money to your

655
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:53,280
credit card from the bank app.

656
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Steam. An application that you can

657
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
download and play. Okay, we're going to do OBS.

658
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,630
Oh, my download sucks though.

659
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,630
This is going to take so long.

660
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,960
This sucks. Buy a microphone

661
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
from the Zamazor website.

662
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:17,730
Watch something. Alright, hold on.

663
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,730
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Buy a microphone.

664
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:26,500
From Zamazor.

665
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,849
I'm very hungry. Hold on.

666
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,619
Where's Zamazor?

667
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,619
Buy a microphone from the Zamazor website.

668
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,510
Oh, there it is.

669
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,460
Why is it not Zamazon? Oh, right.

670
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
Because it actually says Amazon.

671
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,960
If you make it Zamazon.

672
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,159
And I'll buy a toilet too.

673
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,159
Okay. We need

674
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,159
furniture.

675
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,159
Toilet's furniture.

676
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:02,159
Yes, it is. Thank God.

677
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:08,110
And a

678
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:15,340
What else? We need a microphone.

679
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,739
Look at this thing.

680
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:20,739
Like a WWF mic.

681
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,739
I need the cheap one. I don't have any money.

682
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,500
This is a really bad rating.

683
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Quality sound in this microphone.

684
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,500
97 bucks. Get it.

685
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,679
Alright. Toilet and a microphone.

686
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,679
Only the essentials from Amazon.

687
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,949
I can't afford it.

688
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:41,949
Shit. Okay.

689
00:43:41,949 --> 00:43:45,139
We can't have a toilet.

690
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:49,869
A cheaper toilet.

691
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:51,869
Do they have cheaper toilets? 420.

692
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:55,710
Oh, 215. Here we go.

693
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,039
Alright. When do they show up?

694
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,039
Give me my microphone. Give me my toilet.

695
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:07,380
Oh, here it comes. Don't ring the bell, please.

696
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,659
Oh, no. That wasn't it.

697
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:14,860
Download Fortnite.

698
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,260
Hold on. I can't

699
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,690
download Fortnite yet.

700
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,309
Wait. Does this take like a couple of days?

701
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:26,510
I'm sure it does.

702
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,570
Alright. I can just send money to a credit card.

703
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,570
Oh, this is my shitty computer.

704
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:36,639
I gotta go to the bank app.

705
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,699
No Amazon Prime.

706
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:44,059
Pepe left.

707
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,059
Alright. Fuck this. I'm gonna

708
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,889
Where's my bank?

709
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,889
Way too many apps. Get rid of that shit.

710
00:44:51,889 --> 00:45:00,659
I don't have enough money to do a ZornHub account.

711
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:05,139
What happened to the burrito?

712
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:09,420
Okay. Money transfer.

713
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,730
Complete the transfer. I now have $800

714
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:17,170
in my account.

715
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,369
I need to transfer to my credit card.

716
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:22,369
Transfer to card.

717
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:26,699
All your money.

718
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:28,699
So I've got $918 on this

719
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,699
credit card. That's enough to buy a ZornHub account.

720
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:37,090
Why did that not work?

721
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:42,269
Didn't that be a quest?

722
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:48,420
Don't fucking do it.

723
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,599
Oh, on the phone.

724
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,599
Why use the phone app when you have access to the desktop

725
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,599
application? They're always ten times better.

726
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,980
Alright. Transfer to my account.

727
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,980
Like $70.

728
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,980
Now I'm gonna transfer all this. We're gonna open up the bank.

729
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:16,159
Where's my bank account?

730
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:18,159
Send all money to your credit card.

731
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,809
Thank you.

732
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,809
Sleep and save the game. Sure thing.

733
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:29,739
Now deliveries will be there. Cough.

734
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:32,300
Murmur. Turn left.

735
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,130
Okay. I did it.

736
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:40,719
I need to order some food, too.

737
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,050
Delivery? Oh, what?

738
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,340
I gotta order food. I gotta order a lot of food.

739
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,699
I'm gonna get like five things.

740
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:59,980
It's in the dumpster. Okay.

741
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,980
I gotta go to food shop.

742
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,980
And I'm gonna order like three burritos.

743
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,980
I'm gonna order two Big Macs. Two McChicken sandwiches.

744
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:11,039
A large fry and a large Coke.

745
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:18,269
Get the German meal.

746
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,269
Lamb rack? Mushroom bucket.

747
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:23,090
Ugh. Who would order this?

748
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,090
Just only

749
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,969
mushrooms?

750
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:31,619
Octopus balls?

751
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,619
Parfait? A pierogi?

752
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:35,619
Of just a whole pig? It's $8.

753
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,250
Baked beans.

754
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,920
Alright, we're gonna just get a shitload of these.

755
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,769
Alright, we're gonna get a bunch of beans and candy.

756
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:54,210
And some dog food.

757
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,210
Don't we have a dog? No, that was the other guy's house.

758
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,090
Alright, wait, wait. Get some actual food.

759
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:05,150
Okay.

760
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,150
When you get a post-bates

761
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,150
or Uber Eats or like a Grubhub order like this

762
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,150
you're just like, come on, dude. Like, fuck you.

763
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,420
Am I really gonna go get you

764
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,420
12 cans of beans and like

765
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,420
a bag of dog food?

766
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:26,849
Come on, man. That's a lot of money.

767
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:32,030
I'm very hungry.

768
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,420
Three whole pigs.

769
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,420
I wanna see them put this over here.

770
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,420
I'm gonna be the-

771
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,420
Dude! The smile's on the box!

772
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,110
Oh shit, hold on.

773
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:53,889
Oops.

774
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,380
Don't throw the microphone.

775
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,380
Alright, hold on. What the fuck?

776
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,539
Hey!

777
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,539
Okay, I ordered-

778
00:49:04,539 --> 00:49:06,539
I ordered enough food for the Super Bowl party

779
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:09,550
I'm gonna have.

780
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,980
Let me put this down.

781
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,980
What is this thing? This is like a bar of Rice Crispy Street.

782
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,670
Alright, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.

783
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,670
Wait, where's my other Amazon order?

784
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:26,670
Okay, no. Pick that up.

785
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,840
Alright, where's the bathroom? I don't have a bathroom.

786
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,840
I think this is supposed to be the bathroom

787
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,840
but this is my streamer room.

788
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,449
So, you know, whatever.

789
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:46,829
Press to make your toilet.

790
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:55,469
I have to go again.

791
00:49:55,469 --> 00:50:04,500
Twice.

792
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
I've had- Hey, do not-

793
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Everybody that's freaking out right now is saying, what the fuck?

794
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
No. How many times have you done that before?

795
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
You did a full 30 or 40 second piss

796
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
and then-

797
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Okay, here comes another one. Here comes another full

798
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:23,539
30 second piss.

799
00:50:23,539 --> 00:50:28,019
Okay, I gotta eat this whole pig.

800
00:50:28,019 --> 00:50:34,480
No, my mic!

801
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
I have so much food.

802
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,480
Do I have a fridge?

803
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,360
Does this food go bad?

804
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:48,460
Okay, I got a lot of canned food though.

805
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:55,869
What does this build?

806
00:50:55,869 --> 00:51:00,539
Uh oh. What? Okay.

807
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:07,579
Let's just gonna have to stay there.

808
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:10,460
Alright.

809
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:26,320
I'm not doing this all day.

810
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,619
This will work eventually.

811
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:34,320
This is canned food, it's fine.

812
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,559
I just ate the dog food.

813
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,559
Didn't throw this dog food.

814
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:47,380
Candy!

815
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:57,550
I can't even pick these up.

816
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,940
I was just seeing if I could break the glass.

817
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,940
What the- Hey, come on.

818
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,900
Wait, I can do- There we go.

819
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,900
Candy Andy.

820
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,139
That's me.

821
00:52:11,139 --> 00:52:28,590
Candy Andy.

822
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,239
I feel so dirty.

823
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:35,820
Look, just let me get one stream in

824
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,820
and I'll make millions.

825
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:51,440
Doesn't matter.

826
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,250
Back up, back up.

827
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,420
First person sims.

828
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,349
Okay, I did it. Turn the computer on.

829
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:20,079
I'm ready for my first stream.

830
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:26,989
Your P gauge replenished all the way.

831
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:29,679
Okay, I've got OBS. Stream key.

832
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,940
Link your blender account and start streaming.

833
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,940
Set the highest quality broadcast based on your current upload speed.

834
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,019
Alright.

835
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:42,559
I don't need any more food. Come on, hurry the fuck up.

836
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,170
What's the stream key?

837
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,730
It was 1390, yeah.

838
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,099
Blender.

839
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:55,619
I have OBS.

840
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,619
1394.

841
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:59,619
1390.

842
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:03,119
Okay.

843
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,260
Oh, shit. Stream quality.

844
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,500
144p.

845
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Show cam.

846
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,929
Oh, I don't have a cam.

847
00:54:12,929 --> 00:54:14,929
30 fps, I can't handle anything else.

848
00:54:14,929 --> 00:54:18,900
Recommended bitrate, 700.

849
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Stream category.

850
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,329
Okay, just chatting. Stream settings.

851
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:32,659
Okay.

852
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:35,469
The lowest bitrate you can have is 100.

853
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,469
The lowest bitrate you can have is 100?

854
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:42,579
Oh.

855
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,579
400.

856
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:50,059
Oh, fuck. I wasn't ready.

857
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:01,519
Just like everybody's first stream, okay?

858
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:03,889
No one's watching the stream.

859
00:55:03,889 --> 00:55:05,889
Wait silently.

860
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,730
Listen, every single person that

861
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,730
started a Twitch account, there's somebody here.

862
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:21,500
Yo! How long is the stream?

863
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,809
Just...

864
00:55:23,809 --> 00:55:25,809
Just messing with some settings.

865
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,809
You are obese.

866
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:44,050
You are...

867
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,050
Yeah, sorry for that. Or you are

868
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:52,190
all stupid.

869
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,190
How many people here listen to music?

870
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,989
No, I don't like music.

871
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,989
Drop, drop, drop. You can't even

872
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,989
speak properly. I think throw your computer in the trash.

873
00:56:02,989 --> 00:56:04,989
Fuck you, buddy.

874
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:09,659
Go watch another stream if you don't

875
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:12,030
like it. Oh, wait.

876
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,960
I banned that person?

877
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,179
Two viewers fight each other.

878
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,179
Warn them. Say, easy. Cut it out.

879
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:30,670
I feel so dirty.

880
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:35,150
If I wasn't sleepy. What's up?

881
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,150
Hey!

882
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,150
There's someone who says he can never be

883
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,480
a streamer. This does not concern

884
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,480
him at all. I think he's right.

885
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:52,739
Stream a game.

886
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:54,739
Oh, shit. Hold on. Okay.

887
00:56:54,739 --> 00:56:58,110
Uh, game.

888
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:00,110
Wait, I'm lying. I'm faking

889
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:02,670
the category. There's someone who says he can

890
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,809
never be a streamer. That doesn't concern me.

891
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:12,210
I need a game. Hey!

892
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,210
You ever seen this before?

893
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:20,030
Speedrun

894
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,210
ban incoming. Donate

895
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:27,650
received. Have you ever...

896
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,650
Have you ever been stealing?

897
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:43,199
Never.

898
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,199
First stream. I'm gonna get banned.

899
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,659
Wait, I'm getting donations.

900
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:57,980
Hey!

901
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,349
Why are you hacking me?

902
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:02,349
L, R,

903
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:05,340
R, L,

904
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,340
O. What happened?

905
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,340
You have been hacked. You lost

906
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:18,750
$200. How?

907
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,889
Have you ever been stealing

908
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,889
one day?

909
00:58:23,889 --> 00:58:40,269
What are these? Okay.

910
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:42,269
I am about to get

911
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,090
banned in real life

912
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,519
in the game while I'm

913
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:49,519
pretending to get banned in the game

914
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:51,519
on the fake stream.

915
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,260
Oh, the stream died.

916
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:02,190
What happened? I passed out?

917
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:10,750
I got banned?

918
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,750
Oh, well, whatever. We'll be back tomorrow.

919
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,750
I got six viewers though.

920
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:20,190
I'm fucking hungry.

921
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:32,019
I need to download some games tomorrow.

922
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:34,019
Alright, fucking move this goddamn thing.

923
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:45,090
There. Alright, now move this.

924
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:50,320
Much better. Get a camera?

925
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,699
Get a camera

926
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:55,699
and go to Zornov.

927
00:59:55,699 --> 01:00:05,809
My fucking god.

928
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:12,400
I'm never gonna, my career is never gonna

929
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:22,699
take off. Hey, Princess Hotcakes,

930
01:00:22,699 --> 01:00:25,260
thanks for the five community

931
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:29,420
subs.

932
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,599
Thanks for the five subs. I need to take a shower

933
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,599
too, but hold on.

934
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:44,849
Ooh, a pig. Alright, what does heat mean?

935
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,090
Any air conditioner? Alright, I need to

936
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,800
wait, download some games. How tired am I?

937
01:00:50,800 --> 01:01:02,190
Okay, wait, I have energy.

938
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,190
I need to download steam and then I have to download a few games

939
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:12,260
so I can stream a game. 3080?

940
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,139
Okay, don't stream yet.

941
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:20,239
Nope.

942
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:22,239
Ooh, dude.

943
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:24,239
Somebody comes over your house.

944
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:26,739
Your mom comes over.

945
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:29,099
Your parents are over your house.

946
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:31,099
Computer turns on. That's the last thing that Mozilla saved.

947
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:33,920
And you fucking hit back wicked

948
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,920
quick, but they saw. They saw.

949
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:47,889
They know. Oh, I can do cryptocurrency?

950
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:49,889
I can buy houses.

951
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:51,889
Why is there so much in this game? Okay.

952
01:01:51,889 --> 01:02:02,059
Apps.

953
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:06,420
Zorn, were you watching Zorn?

954
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,420
Zno. Zom.

955
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,420
Zai was not.

956
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:18,530
Okay, just download them all on Spotify.

957
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,960
Enhance your stream with music and sound effects.

958
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,199
Stream Lap.

959
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,199
You can see the donations and subscriptions that come in, okay.

960
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,500
Oh, virus scans.

961
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,769
Cryptocurrency Miner.

962
01:02:30,769 --> 01:02:32,769
And a VPN.

963
01:02:32,769 --> 01:02:36,210
Wait, what?

964
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,210
We're going to think we used access websites where accesses are restricted.

965
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,409
That's not for security purposes?

966
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:52,420
VPNs are snake oil.

967
01:02:56,059 --> 01:02:58,059
Zokey. Zokey, dude.

968
01:02:58,059 --> 01:03:02,210
Wait, let's watch YouTube.

969
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:09,949
What can we watch on YouTube?

970
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:11,949
I'm going to call the fucking cable company.

971
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:17,380
I have to upload a video.

972
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,579
I don't have any videos.

973
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:24,610
Aw, shit. Okay, I have to record videos.

974
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:31,389
Alright, where's my apps?

975
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:40,460
Come on, Steam, hurry up.

976
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:47,500
Zermacraft or Zagat.

977
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,380
Please take a shower.

978
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:55,500
Alright, Steam's almost ready.

979
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
I'm going to say fuck this joke.

980
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,059
I'm sorry. We're just having fun, man.

981
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:02,059
Alright, Steam.

982
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:04,369
TheMitcher3.

983
01:04:04,369 --> 01:04:06,860
CarStryka.

984
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,860
Fallgang.

985
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,860
CyberPrank.

986
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,550
ThePastOfUs.

987
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:16,940
DarkSouls. Yep.

988
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,940
RocketSucker.

989
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:24,380
Fallgang. Alright, I can't afford anymore money.

990
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,559
We're going to be a DarkSouls.

991
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:35,579
Fall Guys.

992
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,579
And Rocket League streamer.

993
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:39,579
And we're going to preorder the

994
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,579
$120 CyberPunk277

995
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:43,579
Keanu Reeves Figurine Box

996
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,190
that has the ten

997
01:04:46,190 --> 01:05:03,289
figures in it in the art book and it wastes 42 pounds! 42 pound art book that's

998
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:16,710
right. Ooh library do I have any games? No. Quite the selection on Steam. Okay

999
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:21,630
those are downloading. Okay Streamlabs. I got donations. Enter your stream key. You

1000
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:30,639
don't give your stream key to Streamlabs. The streamers look very nerd.

1001
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:51,900
Ban that fucking guy. Don't let him come back. Ooh scan for viruses. I got hacked

1002
01:05:51,900 --> 01:06:05,929
remember? Like just scan them all in. I did go to Zornhub a few times so I

1003
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:16,030
wouldn't be- oh uh oh. The funniest part when you run this on somebody's computer that

1004
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:22,179
doesn't know anything about computers is this looks like this and then it jumps

1005
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:28,300
up to like four or five hundred in ten seconds. Doesn't look that bad until it

1006
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:36,469
gets halfway through. These are also people that have probably never cleared

1007
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:44,769
their cache, their temporary files, their browser history ever. You could literally

1008
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:48,690
like on like your grandmother's computer you could probably see a website in her

1009
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:58,380
history that she went to like in 2013. What about the other five viruses? What's

1010
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:13,440
this bullshit? Scan it again. Do it again. If you're not fully clean then what's the

1011
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,820
point? They're just gonna multiply and you're gonna get more viruses. You gotta pay

1012
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:46,150
for those. You do? This computer is cleaner than you are. For now. For you. So

1013
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:50,590
what happened? Did they just went away? Oh a five gigabyte hard drive. That's pretty

1014
01:07:50,630 --> 01:08:19,920
pathetic. What year is it? All right, spottery. Uh, is it just songs? Okay, well it's just on

1015
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:32,100
there. Wallpaper! Oh yes! Like I'm on the moon. Cool. All right, I like that one.

1016
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:46,619
Here's your mining stream key. All right, shut this off. I don't

1017
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:52,180
want to listen to music. Tutorials. Stream, game stats, mining, internet speed. Oh wow

1018
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:59,779
it's all here. Gambling? Bills? Oh, okay cool. All right, what was I doing? Oh yeah

1019
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:05,069
games games games games games. Okay, we're steam. Okay, I'm still not done downloading.

1020
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:15,619
How big are the downloads? What the fuck? They didn't even start. Download on C.

1021
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:25,989
What do I get? 50 gigs. I want Fall Guys and Dark Souls first. Cyber Prank 2066 is

1022
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:29,949
that's a huge game. I need a, I need another, I need a full hard drive to put

1023
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:39,399
this on. All right, we're gonna start with Dark Souls and Fall Game. I got 200

1024
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:48,640
bucks. Let those download while I use the bathroom and eat some beans. I need to go

1025
01:09:48,640 --> 01:10:05,649
sleep. All right, those downloads will be ready when I wake up. Nightmares? All right, we're

1026
01:10:05,649 --> 01:10:18,649
gonna do our first gaming stream today. Steam. Okay, still not done. Jesus. Okay,

1027
01:10:18,649 --> 01:10:22,850
what, how do I get faster? Internet, internet speed. If you're tired of late

1028
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,130
loading of pages of poor quality streaming, buy a new internet package.

1029
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,850
There's a website where you can buy an internet package. You can also buy in

1030
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:40,909
daily turbo packs. I need to take a shower. I haven't taken a shower in three

1031
01:10:40,909 --> 01:10:51,520
days. Okay, where's that app? What's it called? Amazon. Can you buy a shower on

1032
01:10:51,520 --> 01:11:02,750
Amazon? You can't, right? You can't buy this big, like appliances like this. I can

1033
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:14,189
buy a full shower on Amazon. I don't have enough money to do this. Bridge. I don't,

1034
01:11:14,189 --> 01:11:26,689
I don't have enough money for a bathtub. Where's a, what about a shower? Air

1035
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:33,460
conditioner. Stands. Bed. Fireplace. Fridge. Shelf. Sofa. Bath. Toilet. Washing

1036
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:56,460
machine. Go on, just zed it. How do I clean my body? VR headset? I'm gonna have

1037
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,380
to be dirty for a little while. I can't clean myself. Go shower in the

1038
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:08,939
neighbor's house. That's actually not a bad idea. I'll, I'll bring some, uh, I'll

1039
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:29,890
bring an offering. Can I like spray myself with the washer fluid? I feel so

1040
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:39,529
dirty. What do you think I'm trying to do? Okay, this is, this is like a rust.

1041
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:44,939
That's not even, these are, this is rust. This is, this is, I'm playing on a rust

1042
01:12:44,939 --> 01:13:07,380
server. Hey, hey, hey. You have a bathroom? You smell disgusting. Get out of the

1043
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:17,140
shower. I just ate a handful of beans with my hands in front of them. Is this

1044
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:29,250
his car? I wanna, I'm not disgusting. You're disgusting. What are you talking

1045
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:36,180
about? Bite with my canine into the top of the can and like cartoon around to get

1046
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:39,100
the lid off and then reach in with my bare hand and eat it with the other one.

1047
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:55,050
Can I play, I need some money. Almond Jerry, yeah. Okay, are these done? This is

1048
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:59,149
what it felt like. Some of you guys don't know, but this is what it used to be

1049
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:06,890
like. Back in like the mid 90s, most people had a 28.8k modem. Of course, if

1050
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:11,689
you, if you were really, really, you were doing well, you had a 56k modem.

1051
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:19,369
Some people had 128 and that was just holy shit. You mean that you can open up

1052
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:31,569
your email and load all of your emails in five minutes? You could not download

1053
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:41,670
anything. A 12 gigabyte download? No, no, you didn't download video games. They

1054
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:46,619
came over a series of like 12 disks if they were big enough. Quick, make a World

1055
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:53,899
of Warcraft joke. 2004, my graphics card couldn't handle, wow. So I had to

1056
01:14:53,939 --> 01:14:57,819
play on the lowest settings and it still ran at like 20 FPS. That's all, folks.

1057
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,449
I couldn't even load the mountains in the background. I had to turn everything

1058
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:18,500
down. That was a nice internet clown. Thanks, man. Hey, I'm here to please.

1059
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:23,420
Internet Clown, E-Clown, German at 85. Nice to meet you. That's a good handshake

1060
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:33,800
you got there. Now what do I do? All right, I need to remember you're the

1061
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:40,779
Bugs Bunny of Twitch. I feel like I'm more of a Daffy. Bugs like was kind of

1062
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:45,039
smart and he like outsmarted everybody. Daffy just got angry and broke things

1063
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:50,289
and acted like a child and couldn't comprehend basic sentences. But he was

1064
01:15:50,289 --> 01:16:08,149
funny. Daffy Duck. I don't know what cartoon character. I'm sure there's some

1065
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:15,460
stupid online quiz where I can determine what cartoon character I am. I'm not

1066
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:22,789
Elmo. I don't have any money. I just, I'm just going to sleep. Just go back to

1067
01:16:22,789 --> 01:16:33,489
bed. I can't, I can sleep after an hour. Do the quiz. There are so many. Which

1068
01:16:33,489 --> 01:16:51,300
one? What cartoon character are you? Hold on. No, but this is so, this is not

1069
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:58,659
even accurate. This is, this like, these questions are so, so just basic. I don't

1070
01:16:58,659 --> 01:17:02,250
even know who the, what the character pool is. Well, what's the character pool

1071
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:07,600
here? It's accurate. Okay. I don't, I don't feel like capturing this right now.

1072
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,539
I'm just going to read it. Okay. You have a free afternoon. What are you going to

1073
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:15,539
do? Sing, tidy my room, go exploring, and relax, relax. You're hungry. What do you

1074
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:21,119
fancy? A zebra steak, a grilled cheese sandwich, sushi, or ice cream? Hmm.

1075
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:27,619
Probably grilled cheese. Zebra steak. Favorite type of weather? Snow, sun, monsoon, or

1076
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:33,369
blistering heat. I love the heat. Pick a sport. Baseball. Baseball. What's your

1077
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:42,060
favorite class? PE, woodwork, art, or math? I literally didn't like any of these. I

1078
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:51,020
hated all these. Where's the free period? If I had to choose art. Totally random

1079
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:54,260
question. How are you feeling today? Which one emoji would you choose? The sad

1080
01:17:54,260 --> 01:18:00,659
face? The surprised face? The heart face? Or the eating face? The eating face. Okay.

1081
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:11,489
How old are you? This is asking me how old are you? And the first one is under

1082
01:18:11,489 --> 01:18:22,800
six. I'm the oldest 16. I'm older. If you were a sweet, what color would you be?

1083
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,949
Yellow, red, green, or orange? I'd be green. Green apple. You've got two plane

1084
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:34,109
tickets. Pick a destination. Japan, Norway, America, or Africa. I've always wanted to

1085
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:40,460
go to Japan. Pick a best mate. A snowman, a spaceman, a lion, or a bunny?

1086
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:54,529
Uh, a lion. Pick a hairstyle. Spiky on top, short back and sides, ponytail, or buzz

1087
01:18:54,529 --> 01:19:00,939
cut. What's a spiky on top? Hey, how about a song to get the party started? Thank you

1088
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:09,779
next. Baby shark, wannabe, or wrecking ball? I'm gonna go with, I'm gonna go

1089
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:22,510
with, uh, uh, how about, how about wrecking ball? Okay, here we go. You, hey, okay, ladies

1090
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:30,529
and gentlemen, we got to see, uh, an ad. What cartoon character am I? Let's find out. This

1091
01:19:30,529 --> 01:19:41,619
is just a gamified ad for the, we stopped doing that, gamified ad for, uh, Detective

1092
01:19:41,619 --> 01:19:50,239
Pikachu. It's just a gamified ad. Oh, I'm Pikachu. And then on the bottom, I don't

1093
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:56,270
know if you can see that. It says image by Detective Pikachu movie on Instagram. So,

1094
01:19:56,989 --> 01:20:08,380
I'm apparently Pikachu. But I get, I think all of, all of us are. Is it Pikachu? Hold

1095
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:16,659
on a minute. Spiky hairstyle. Pikachu doesn't have that. Lions are your best friends. Who,

1096
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:22,060
what lion is Pikachu's best friend? Is it because I picked Japan? It's like a,

1097
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:28,960
originated in Japan? I picked, my favorite color was green. Yellow was an option. I didn't pick

1098
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:39,659
it. I picked green. Pikachu's not green. My favorite class was art and my sport was baseball.

1099
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:48,050
I loved the heat. Pikachu doesn't like the heat. It doesn't retake the quiz. No. You guys, I don't

1100
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:55,359
know. Some of you new viewers might not remember this, but we did like 40, like quiz personality

1101
01:20:55,359 --> 01:21:05,470
tests, like three years ago. Is it time to do it again at some point? I'll set that up. All right.

1102
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:12,369
All right. We're going to do that tomorrow. I'm dead serious. Tomorrow, I'm chubby. Tomorrow's

1103
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:17,819
going to be a fucked up stream. We're going to do, we're doing chubby bunny. I've mined and I'll do

1104
01:21:17,819 --> 01:21:25,789
a bunch of fucking cartoon character personality quizzes. This is your stream tomorrow. I'll get

1105
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:40,189
those set up. At least downloaded yet. Okay. Steam. What the fuck? Hurry up and download.

1106
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:57,020
Tomorrow is chubby bunny. Yep. I paused it. No, I didn't. It's gone. What about my VPN?

1107
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:04,750
You can change your current location by activating the VPN. What's MBTI? Those are the Myers-Briggs.

1108
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:11,779
I've taken it twice. I forget what it was. The first time I took it was ENFP. The second time

1109
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:17,039
I took it, it was a little different. The first time I took it, I was like 20. The second time I

1110
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:34,529
took it, I, it was different. It was like, it was like E N like I J or something. ENFP is what I,

1111
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:41,090
the last, the one I really remember was ENFP. Are you fucking moron? You have to leave the

1112
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:47,739
download window open. All right. Let's see if this person gets banned. It gets banned for real.

1113
01:22:48,560 --> 01:23:04,300
8.5, 8.6. Oh man. They're right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Might have been a, might have been a

1114
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:28,029
glitch. VIP in for the day. God damn it. I'm not going to mod them. You get VIP for 15 minutes.

1115
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:38,189
I don't even know their name. I just saw their text. Make him the new Jerma. Give him the stream

1116
01:23:38,189 --> 01:23:42,350
key. I can't believe I had to actually have the, I slept two days in a row for this shit.

1117
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:59,439
It was me. I, it could be anybody. Cause I don't know. Can you get off the PC while leaving the

1118
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:11,199
window open? Um, hold on. I'm about to get Dark Souls. It could be in this very room. It could even.

1119
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:26,109
Oops. Dark Souls. Oh, dark walls. Dark wall. Downloaded. All right. Let's go. Dark souls.

1120
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:39,090
Does the game play itself? Turn on the stream. Hold on. I want to make sure my settings work.

1121
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:52,779
I'm not going to stream Dark Souls at 400 K up. You won't be able to see anything.

1122
01:24:52,779 --> 01:25:03,840
What are you, what is this? This is Dark Souls. No, no, no. This is, this is what you get when you

1123
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,119
torrent Dark Souls. This is what happens when you get the wrong torrent and then you go,

1124
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:16,460
what is this? Oh no. What did I download? It's supposed to be Dark Souls and oh, I'm in trouble

1125
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:23,439
now. I got to clean my computer. I got to reinstall windows. Am I about to beat the game?

1126
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:35,250
All right. Hold on. Wait. I got to stream this. I have to stream. I got to have real reactions.

1127
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,930
All right. Let's do it. Let's stream. Let's go. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to beat Dark

1128
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:59,970
Souls on stream. On stream. You understand? Okay. Game. 700 upload. Shitty quality, but it's okay.

1129
01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:20,770
How do I cap show? Save the stream. No, I can't. Okay. Here we go. Stream going. Donation. Oh,

1130
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:31,500
where's my stream labs? Hey, somebody subscribed. Thanks. What's up? Yeah. I'm just checking out

1131
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:38,750
Dark Souls. I will subscribe to you with a credit card that I stole. Uh, don't do that. Checking out

1132
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:45,310
Dark Souls for the first time guys. Welcome. You got chips and cola. Nice dude. What the fuck was

1133
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:56,180
that? I just hear a, I think the 18 plus category should be added here. I'm looking for my favorite

1134
01:26:56,180 --> 01:27:05,199
streamer. Well, yeah, just hold on. Just wait, dude. I can mod them? Press the F key to ban.

1135
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:16,130
Oh, that guy was looking for a favorite streamer. I'm not a sub. I'm using ad block. I don't send

1136
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:25,279
donate. I watch for free. You're obese. Sorry. Spam, spam, spam. Shut up. Hey, can I reach you?

1137
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:30,989
Yes. What are you, what can you do? What can I do for you? There's 12 people watching. Holy shit.

1138
01:27:30,989 --> 01:27:44,239
I gotta play. I will. Hey, don't fucking do that. How? What? Why? Why would you do that to me?

1139
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:58,159
Bad stream. No, ban these people. I need a mod. Do not ever ban me. It's not a bad stream. Just

1140
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:10,060
wait. I'm going to be dark souls on stream. I want to be a streamer too, but the blender refused my

1141
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:22,350
application. I gotta get 400 live viewers. Fuck. Okay. Can I do, why does this feel like a real

1142
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:39,659
stream? Oh my God. I'm so bad at this. So don't fucking hack me again. I just ran a virus scan.

1143
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,920
Thank you. Jay1299552 for the sub. I appreciate it. I'm currently getting hacked right now.

1144
01:28:53,340 --> 01:29:08,159
Uh, you've been hacked. You are king. Thanks for the subs. Wait, where's my other, one viewer says

1145
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:13,020
he's imitating another streamer. Whatever. All right. Get it off the screen. I can't see.

1146
01:29:13,819 --> 01:29:24,460
Don't show the IP by mistake. It's a single player cereal box game. Suggest a good TV show. Uh,

1147
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:29,489
the boys. I'm watching the boys right now. It's pretty good. The boys is a pretty good show.

1148
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:34,560
Really? I've just, season two is pretty crazy. I think you can be, I think you can be a good game.

1149
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:45,600
Shut up. I have to beat this. I mean that in a very nice way. I closed the stream. No! Right

1150
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:54,060
when I beat the level, Esports are ready. Can I save it and I will pick up tomorrow and I'll

1151
01:29:54,060 --> 01:30:06,979
continue my Dark Souls playthrough? Okay. I'm going to save it here. How many, I made some money.

1152
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:11,859
Holy shit. I made 17 bucks. Never sub, never donated, ad block on, stolen laptop. Okay. Thanks

1153
01:30:11,859 --> 01:30:18,460
for the 17 bucks. That doesn't make any sense. Never subbed, never donated, ad block on. Okay.

1154
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:37,100
Thanks for the $17. Pog, I made my coffee and I, thank you. I, how much money? That's pretty good.

1155
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:48,720
I have a different, wait, get paid. If the incoming donates are over the $10, we instantly

1156
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:59,489
transfer you to bank. Today, total donation, total account is $35.08. Thank you. I want a different

1157
01:30:59,489 --> 01:31:11,260
sound than the doot to do. Minus the $200 from hacking. I have to pay attention when the hack

1158
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:16,640
happens. All right. Now I leave my cam on and accidentally keep it on while I sleep.

1159
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:22,300
And I'll make way more money for some weird reason. Oh, I forgot to put the music on.

1160
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:31,600
All right. I'm going to continue my Dark Souls playthrough tomorrow. You need the VPN.

1161
01:31:39,229 --> 01:31:44,989
No, didn't never sub, never donated. Except for right now, I gave more money than anyone has the

1162
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:57,420
whole time you've been streaming. I need air, I need air conditioning. This dude left his cam on

1163
01:31:57,420 --> 01:32:01,739
and ate two cans of beans off the floor. All right. Let's go. I don't got any time to waste.

1164
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:08,140
We're going to continue our playthrough. I'm coming back. Hey, you got to be, I'm going to

1165
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:17,869
be consistent. It's me. I got 25 followers. Let's go. Ooh, what happened? Thanks for the sub.

1166
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:31,779
I'm paying for this internet. Entertain me. That's what I'm doing. Who just came in? Hey,

1167
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:36,340
thank you. Oof. Even though there are publications that I don't like, it's generally good. Sure.

1168
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:42,189
Whatever. I don't know. I have no idea what that means. Where do you live? I live in Las Vegas.

1169
01:32:42,189 --> 01:33:12,460
Continuing my playthrough of Dark Souls. Streaming is going well. Yeah, it's going pretty good.

1170
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:20,989
Someone is advertising. Ban them. What do you want me to do? Watching stream while eating plus

1171
01:33:20,989 --> 01:33:43,819
one. Do not ever ban me. Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck? KeckW. All right,

1172
01:33:43,819 --> 01:33:48,060
who is it? Somebody's going crazy here. Support. They subbed. Hey, thanks for the sub. This is,

1173
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:54,260
all right. Those of you that are wondering, this is a great example of why I do not read

1174
01:33:54,260 --> 01:34:00,770
subs and donations really on stream. This is why. If you want a perfect example,

1175
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:09,300
someone's advertising. Talk about his mother? No. All right, whatever I did. You never read

1176
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:16,880
anything. Yeah, but I'm just saying. Hey, thanks. Wow, what am I doing? Dark Souls. Oh, hey. I

1177
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,680
didn't like you before, but now it's fine. Hey, thanks. Thanks for the dollar. Okay, bye.

1178
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:34,180
Dark Souls. Nice, nice. Pretty hard. Pretty hard part. I didn't get the, oh, I got to get the coin

1179
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:53,359
in the middle. Fuck. Wait. Fuck. Why am I trying to entertain these people? They're not real.

1180
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:12,130
Got it. I'm trying to entertain a fake audience. I bought chips and cola. All right. Hey, whoever

1181
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:23,060
that was. Thanks. How do I get down here? That's how. Oh shit. I feel so dirty. You got to go quick.

1182
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:33,939
Fuck. Stop. Just leave me alone. Leap. The streamer is bored. Hey, hey, hey. This is very,

1183
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:39,220
very nerd. I'm your sub. Thanks for the sub. Hey, mouse a lot action. Thanks for the subscription.

1184
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:46,180
Spallolalia. Thanks for the sub. I4dimwit. Thanks for the sub. Tom Unicorn. Can you say my darling's

1185
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:54,369
name and say I love her? Sure. Uh, talk about your mother. Hey, listen. Thanks for the subscription.

1186
01:35:54,369 --> 01:35:59,409
Appreciate that. Uh, hey, have a good, have a good afternoon. You and your loved one.

1187
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:04,449
Steemolotology. Thanks for the $7.08. I'm sending you the last money on my card. What are you doing,

1188
01:36:04,449 --> 01:36:10,189
man? Are you crazy? Hey, thanks for the $3.08. I made my coffee and I came here. Hey, thanks a

1189
01:36:10,189 --> 01:36:24,460
lot, man. Appreciate it. This is getting meta. I just have to beat this fucking level. How many,

1190
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:34,289
how many people are watching? Am I even streaming anymore? Oh, fuck. Turn the stream back on. This

1191
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:42,479
is a hard level. All right. I'll get back at it tomorrow. No progress. Omega low. No progress.

1192
01:36:46,289 --> 01:36:56,850
What does this mean? Oh, I have, I can level up, right? I can, I have a skill tree. Streamer skills.

1193
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,399
Okay. Learn this one. I have an extra slot in my backpack. Oh my goodness. What do we got now?

1194
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:07,569
Increase the number of miners you can buy. That's a crypto thing. Garbage motivation

1195
01:37:07,569 --> 01:37:15,979
decreases more slowly. Uh, increases your zoo tube video upload limit. I don't have enough money for

1196
01:37:15,979 --> 01:37:32,399
this. I'm so tired. All right. Hold on. What's wrong with me? That didn't sound good. I'm like

1197
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:44,510
dying. I'm like sick because I won't take a shower and I won't sleep. Why can't I sleep? How do I

1208
01:39:18,739 --> 01:39:25,630
I need to take a shower before I go to work. I wouldn't want to be waited by this guy.

1217
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:39,579
Fuck. What's wrong with me? Why is my health... Why am I dying from eating beans?

That's true. I can't even buy food. I'm fucked. I'm fucked. I'm fucked. What? Hello? Welcome.

1229
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:39,010
Hold on. I'm good. It's the first day you look out the window, you see this. Is that the new

1231
01:45:04,350 --> 01:45:16,979
do that. Watch out for that school bus. Where's the entrance? Where's the restaurant?

1232
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:34,880
Why am I going into work with no nourishment? I have like my vitamin C level is probably zero.

Okay. Get out of here. Okay. I'm ready to work. What happened? Wait. What time is it? What time

I can't believe I fucking read that. Jesus Christ. Leave me alone. I'm trying to,

1239
01:47:10,109 --> 01:47:17,149
I'm trying to just live, man. All right. We need to go home. Should I go get a pizza or something?

01:49:37,819 --> 01:49:52,020
All right. We're going to play blackjack that we have nobody by bath. Wait, can I eat in here?

1249
01:49:52,020 --> 01:50:00,449
Can I just eat? Can I have, I need medicine. Is there actually a doctor? Use the neighbor's bath.

1250
01:50:00,449 --> 01:50:12,460
I don't think I could even go in neighbor's houses. I can't go into other people's houses guys.

1251
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:33,229
Nothing in the trash. Trash motivation. What does that even mean? Can I dump that on me? Wait. Oh,

1252
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:50,699
I can't just spray this all over me. All right. Shit. I just, I'm going home. Where's my house?

1253
01:50:50,699 --> 01:50:58,340
You can go to like the hacker's house. Where's the house? All right. Can you shut that music off?

1254
01:50:58,979 --> 01:51:16,829
I need to buy a bath. Don't eat any of this shit. It's going to make me puke and I'm going to die.

I have a hundred dollars in my bank account and I'm about to die. And you want me to buy a dog?

1292
01:58:55,579 --> 01:59:01,180
annoyed. You do it so often that it doesn't even bother me. Okay, cool. I'm going to block you.

01:59:57,149 --> 02:00:11,739
Bathtub. Go on Amazon and get a bathtub. Repeat bet. No. Once we get to the bathtub threshold,

02:00:11,739 --> 02:00:16,899
that's when we pull out. 400 bucks. Portable air conditioner. No, that's not what I want.

02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:35,149
Something healthy. Something that's less than five dollars. Not a donut. Land pudding. Fruits.

02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:46,989
Melon bread. Miso soup. That's healthy as shit. Get two of them. I want two miso soups. This is

1308
02:01:46,989 --> 02:01:57,310
healthy. It's like fish broth. There's like chunks of meat in there and stuff. Yes. All right. Now

1309
02:01:57,310 --> 02:02:13,229
I gotta go sleep. Oh my god. I'm about to die. I'm actually about to die. Quick. Deliver it to me,

1310
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:23,279

1311
02:02:27,470 --> 02:02:34,770
I'm sorry. All right. Miso soup. Okay. Wait. I gotta save this game. How do you save the game?

1312
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:43,630
Okay. This is good for you. It's got like tofu. It's got broth. It's got like lentils. I don't

1313
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:48,050
know what else. I've never had it before. I think I've taken one sip and I went, no. I don't know

1314
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:58,699
it's good for you. I know it's pretty good. I got a text. I got bills. I don't. Okay. Those can wait.

02:02:58,699 --> 02:03:13,659
Where's my bathtub? I need that bathtub right now. Check the dumpster. Oh shit. You're right.

1316
02:03:20,659 --> 02:03:27,680
Bath tub. Get it in the house. I need medicine. All right. I'll get you medicine in just a minute.

1317
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:41,970
Just hold on. I have to take two baths in a row. Okay. Now we're doing just fine. I can buy the

1318
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:50,770
medicine now. I don't have any money for medicine. I need to work first. What time is it? I gotta get

1319
02:03:50,770 --> 02:04:13,229
to work later. Hurry. Where's my car? It actually is an outhouse here. I thought that was bullshit

1320
02:04:13,229 --> 02:04:37,970
that you were lying to me. Where's my car? Where the fuck is the car? How much is medicine? Gotta

1329
02:06:46,699 --> 02:07:20,369
There is. Get off my screen. This is life simulator, but you are a streamer. Uh oh.

1330
02:07:30,609 --> 02:07:37,420
I need medicine. What a perfect time for that to pop up. You know, I think I need medicine.

1331
02:07:37,420 --> 02:08:00,380
My car is just a little dirty. All right. Gas. How much is gas? I've rented a gas

02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:43,069
92 bucks? Let's bargain. Or did I get? No, I, I give me pills. Okay. Good. I got medicine.

1336
02:09:43,069 --> 02:10:20,270
Here we go. Okay. It just costs $10 to use this toilet. Be serious. That's why I take a shower.

1337
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:31,039
For God's sakes. Yeah. It's 10 just to use it. All right. I got, I need, I'm hungry. Do I have

1338
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:41,920

Boo dollar Andy. Just wait. Just wait till my career explodes. What am I doing on hygiene? Good.

Okay. I got to sleep. I'm hungry and I need to sleep. Bean. Eat beans. I'm going to lose health.

1345
02:11:47,729 --> 02:11:59,170

1350
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:10,619
Eat the beans. Beans hurt. They actually hurt. It's just, it's expired. That's why.

1351
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,439
Expiration date. It looks disgusting. Well, let's see if we can sell it to that fucking dickhead

1352
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:27,020
over there. Just take a, take one of those metal mesh cloths. The things that you scrape the bottom

1353
02:13:27,020 --> 02:13:32,479
you sync with and just scrape off the expiration date on the bottom. I got beans and they last

1354
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:56,430
forever. Everybody knows he looks very angry. He looks very angry. Why? What the fuck? What the

1355
02:13:56,430 --> 02:14:16,109
fuck is happening in here? Why a cat? Just release them. Oh no. I can't get that. Can you move out

02:15:47,819 --> 02:15:55,180
Oh, I have to work in three hours. That's okay. We're going to do a short stream.

1400
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:04,610
marked as Dark Souls, but he was just playing impossible games. Chat was incredibly slow.

1401
02:22:04,610 --> 02:22:08,770
Most of the people called him obese and advertised their own channel for some reason. No mods.

1402
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:12,450
But the worst fucking thing is that I donated and asked him to say hello to my loved one and

1403
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:21,549
he just insulted my mother. Anyone knows what's going on with him lately? Um, quite a lot,

1404
02:22:21,549 --> 02:22:32,430
as you can see. Omega lol. Oh my God. Omega lol real. All right. Send money to the card. Wait,

02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:40,049

1406
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:46,719
I can just pee at work. I always go to the bathroom at work. It's fine. I need gas.

1407
02:22:47,360 --> 02:23:06,799
I have to pay for that service. How much is it? Oh, I'll take an Uber. Set the destination where

1408
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:18,459
you want to go. I can't take an Uber to work. I can't walk to work. I know why I gotta go.

1409
02:23:19,899 --> 02:23:28,270
Stop. I know I have to work. Leave me alone. Job king. Your waiter job starts. You're ready.

Okay. Hey, what's going on guys? Just chilling today. I get bored while streaming.

02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:44,399
uh, Fall Guys. Fall Guys sucks. How do I uninstall Fall Guys? You must choose the disc.

1449
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:51,069
I want it on C, but I know no free space. How do I get it off? Uninstall it. I can't uninstall

1450
02:28:51,069 --> 02:28:55,469
the game. I need another hard drive. Are you kidding me? Well, I made some money though.

1451
02:28:55,469 --> 02:29:06,879
That's pretty good. Let's see. I got 145 bucks. That's enough of me to fill the gas with, fill,

1452
02:29:06,879 --> 02:29:19,069
add gas to the car, go to work. I'm going to go to work today. Oh, I got two, uh, gamer points.

1453
02:29:19,069 --> 02:29:32,260
Let's see what they do. Shit. I have, can I upload videos? Did I record any videos?

1454
02:29:32,819 --> 02:29:47,440
Zootube. I could get like ad revenue. A new coffee pasta, new coffee pasta. All right. Upload.

1455
02:29:48,979 --> 02:29:54,209
I don't have any recorded videos. I'm so tired. All right. I gotta, I get to start recording.

1456
02:29:54,850 --> 02:30:12,420
I'm doing all right. Let's go to sleep. Okay. Now I, I'm, I'm okay with food. I need to go

1457
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:16,500
to the bathroom. Then I'm, I'm going to pay this guy, which is stupid to pay 10 bucks to use the

1458
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:25,139
bathroom, but I'm going to do it. I don't have money in my wallet. I go to my, what are you doing?

1459
02:30:26,379 --> 02:30:33,069
What are the ATM? All right. Well, whatever. I'll just, I'll pee. I can't wait to have like

1460
02:30:33,069 --> 02:30:35,309
thousands of dollars in my bank account. It's going to be sick. All right, let's go.

1461
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:46,879
All right. So how much, I have 25% gas. I probably should fill it up more.

1462
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:54,719
Where's the actual gas station around here? It's probably one in town, right?

1463
02:30:57,659 --> 02:31:02,620
Are you going to play this all night? I gotta be real honest with you.

1464
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:09,819
Probably. I was going to play Exanima. Exanima was the backup, but

1465
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:16,270
I don't think we even need a backup. I'm, I'm kind of like completely engaged right now.

1466
02:31:16,909 --> 02:31:35,219
No, don't go back to the house. It'd be dumb. Don't break the car. I just saw the

1467
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:45,340
mini map thing, the tool tip pop up and I was like, Oh, I go that way. Exanima is actually

1468
02:31:45,340 --> 02:31:55,280
awesome. Apparently it's changed a lot since last time I played it. All right. We need a real gas

1469
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:59,780
station here though. I hope there's one here so I don't break down again and have to pay 80 bucks

1470
02:31:59,780 --> 02:32:11,540
to fill the tank. Internet cafe simulator. Was that another game that this person made?

1471
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:25,389
It has to be. No, I've seen that. I've seen that before. I've seen it on steam. Okay. I need a,

1472
02:32:25,389 --> 02:32:35,790
I need gas. Bad. Like right now. Turn the car off. I need to go get gas before work. Where's

1473
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:49,659
there a gas station? Okay. Gas. This one right up here. All right. Straight ahead. I'm out of gas.

1474
02:32:49,659 --> 02:32:57,219
I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. Please. I'm out of gas. No,

1475
02:32:57,219 --> 02:33:16,530
I'm not out of gas. Oh, I just barely made it. Jesus, man. This is so expensive. How much money

1476
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:23,600
do I even have? All right. You don't have enough money in your wallet. Wallet? Just go to work.

1477
02:33:24,319 --> 02:33:39,549
I've got work in 20 minutes. Let's go. That's the kiss door. I'm not going in there.

1478
02:33:43,299 --> 02:33:47,299
Just live downtown. Can you add forehead at that end of that sentence, please?

1479
02:33:47,780 --> 02:34:04,299
I think I have the superpowers, I think. 136 bucks. Let's fill that tank. That should be in

1480
02:34:04,299 --> 02:34:13,329
my wallet, right? I just got paid. Yeah. All right. Fill this tank up. I don't want to get

1481
02:34:13,329 --> 02:34:35,309
gas ever again for this damn car. Let's go with half tank. Okay. That's going to get us a pretty

1482
02:34:35,309 --> 02:34:50,590
long ways. Open. Okay. Hold on. Go to the club. No, not this shit again. That guy just ran into

1483
02:34:50,590 --> 02:35:16,959
a school bus. So did you? No, the school bus ran into me. Is this illegal? Is it nudity in this

1484
02:35:16,959 --> 02:35:24,020
game? Hide screen quick. All right. Let me see if there's nudity. Is there nudity here?

1485
02:35:34,670 --> 02:36:07,680
Maybe you're a fire. This is lap dance area. I got to leave. That's fine. It's fine. It's

1486
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:22,860
kind of resident sleeper in here, I'll be honest. React. React. Oh, sure. Okay.

1487
02:36:22,860 --> 02:36:32,819
Okay. Whoa, what's in there? Oh, I think there might be naked girls in there. No way, dude.

1488
02:36:33,620 --> 02:37:10,500
What's your naked girls? That was my mom? No, it wasn't. Go to work. Oh, shit. I forgot about

1489
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:26,799
work. What time is it? No, I have to sleep, dude. No. You were at work. Yeah, I just was at work.

1490
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:47,340
And then I went into that fucking snooze club. I mean, no one was even dressed up as tracer in

1491
02:37:47,340 --> 02:38:10,020
there. I don't like it. Don't hit this guy. Okay, I gotta go to sleep. And I'm very hungry. I need

1492
02:38:10,020 --> 02:38:27,629
a fridge and it's hot in here. How many complaints a minute can I do? You haven't shit in two weeks.

1493
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:34,659
As it happens when you eat candy every single day for every meal, it kind of bunches you up a

1494
02:38:34,659 --> 02:38:48,620
little. What should you get from McDonald's? Hey, my order. Get the German 985. Don't say I'll take

1495
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:53,569
the German 985 because they have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. That's two McChickens

1496
02:38:53,569 --> 02:38:57,969
with a little bit of mayo. Oh, sorry. Can't order that. Those don't exist anymore. Don't get the

1497
02:38:57,969 --> 02:39:08,959
spicy ones. They're not that good. It's a Big Mac. Sure. Get that. I'm too pissed off that they got

1498
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:13,120
rid of McChickens to continue doing that little bit I was doing there. Maybe I should get a bucket

1499
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:31,250
of mushrooms. Nachos. Octopus balls. Sounds good to me. No, they didn't. Yes, they did. There's no

1500
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:44,079
regular McChicken anymore. It's only spicy McChicken. They don't have them. Yes, there is.

1501
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:52,049
How come I can't get them? Spicy is better though. You're stupid. Wrong. I ate one today. They must

1502
02:39:52,049 --> 02:40:15,389
have been at a stock for like a month. I'm telling you. I tried. I don't hate the spicy McChicken.

1503
02:40:15,389 --> 02:40:25,860
Yes, I will. Spicy. Everything has to have spicy. Spicy McChicken. Spicy Big Mac. Spicy

1504
02:40:27,379 --> 02:40:32,909
soda. You put spicy in front of something. Apparently, it sells. I don't know why.

1505
02:40:32,909 --> 02:40:41,280
You know what? What's the difference between spicy McChicken and regular McChicken?

1506
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:59,309
The spicy McChicken makes your nose run. That's it. I can open cases. Shut up, wanker.

1507
02:41:00,270 --> 02:41:16,940
Dude, let's open a case. CSGO case. Oh my god. Am I going to get the knife? Come on. Do it.

1508
02:41:19,180 --> 02:41:34,059
I just made some money. Dude, a green Mac 10. That sucks. It's not even purple.

1509
02:41:34,059 --> 02:41:45,069
I got mail. I got email. Do that on stream. I would rather you pull out every hair on my body

1510
02:41:45,629 --> 02:41:51,549
individually with a pair of tweezers over the course of a few hours than me to do an open CSGO

1511
02:41:51,549 --> 02:42:08,659
box stream. I would rather do that. Blender payment. I don't want to do that. I've done

1512
02:42:08,659 --> 02:42:15,059
that before a couple of times with TF2. Open them in crates. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.

1513
02:42:15,059 --> 02:42:23,059
Oh my god. Leave me alone. Open the crates for YouTube. Holy shit. That's genius, actually.

1514
02:42:26,020 --> 02:42:37,280
V-T-O. It's Lucas again. Yes, like clockwork, Lucas tries to hack my computer every three days.

1515
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:52,459
I feel like it's automated at this point. He's just checking to see if he's using that password

1516
02:42:53,260 --> 02:43:24,340
anywhere else. I gotta go to work. All right. New rule. I'm not going to do any gambling until

1517
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:28,850
I have at least 500 bucks and then I'm probably going to go all in on one hand. Wait, do I have

1518
02:43:28,850 --> 02:43:36,700
any parts I can sell? Oh, sell the beans to that guy. Wait, can I just go rob my friend's house?

1519
02:43:36,700 --> 02:44:02,819
He had a bunch of computer parts. Yeah. What happened to the beans? I put them in the trunk?

1520
02:44:02,819 --> 02:44:14,639
I didn't put them in my backpack? I swear to god. He in the grass? I don't think that's going to

1521
02:44:14,639 --> 02:44:25,389
work, man. Three bucks. All right. I'm not going to bargain for this. Of course I am.

1522
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:34,370
Inspired beans. Of course I'll take $10 for that one. An extra 50 cents. Whatever. Give me that

1523
02:44:34,370 --> 02:44:49,940
money. Enough for food. I'm kind of obsessed with this game. I don't know why. Something about it.

1524
02:44:49,940 --> 02:45:07,920
There's like scratch tickets. There's blackjack. There's streaming. All right. What time is it?

1525
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:14,159
I have to pay bills. What happens if you don't pay the bills? All right. I got 100 bucks.

1526
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:21,200
Let's go to work. I've missed work, but it's okay. Lifetime weight change. I lost one pound.

1527
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:30,129
Calories over the course of your whole life. I've only consumed 6,666 calories over the course of

1528
02:45:30,129 --> 02:45:39,040
a month. This is not in the game yet. All right. Let's go. I don't know. Let's go explore for a

1529
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:48,180
little bit. No, no, no. Stream. I got streaming. What am I doing? This is streamer simulator.

1530
02:45:52,770 --> 02:45:56,530
I got plenty of energy. Let's go. We're doing a big 24 hour stream right now.

1531
02:45:56,530 --> 02:46:17,069
I'm beating Dark Souls on stream today. Let's go. What's up, guys? Today's the day. Dark Souls is

1532
02:46:17,069 --> 02:46:33,469
going to get completed on stream. Finally going to beat it. Favorite emote? Lul. I didn't like

1533
02:46:33,469 --> 02:46:52,049
that apparently. Fuck all of you. Oop. Somebody gave some money. There should be an 18 plus

1534
02:46:52,049 --> 02:47:10,719
category. All right. Sure. Fine. Oh, no. I went the wrong way. You're a king. There's some more

1535
02:47:10,719 --> 02:47:17,250
money. All right. I got to turn Spotify on. There. That's going to bring in the viewers.

1536
02:47:17,969 --> 02:47:21,940
How can I reach you? I have to ask you something. I don't want you to reach me.

1537
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:48,350
I don't know who this guy is. Leave me alone. 38 viewers. I've got to get to 100 followers.

1538
02:47:48,909 --> 02:48:05,120
How am I supposed to get through this though? It seems impossible. It's not possible to do this.

1539
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:18,420
Someone says they know where you live. Okay. Whatever. There's a definite bot user. I opened

1540
02:48:18,420 --> 02:48:30,319
a broadcast and it was not watched. This is weird. Fuck this stream. Can I just leave through

1541
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:43,920
anywhere? I don't even know. Somebody's got collateral. Someone in chat insults those who

1542
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:56,260
subscribe. Ban his whole family. Okay. We've banned his entire family. That's loud. I'm getting a lot

1543
02:48:56,260 --> 02:49:09,549
of donations this stream. I'm doing pretty good, I think. Honestly, I don't think I can beat this

1544
02:49:09,549 --> 02:49:31,540
level. How do I do this part? You can't beat this part. Green spots. Yeah. I got to go to that one,

1545
02:49:31,540 --> 02:49:45,260
but I can't even go past here. Go in the corner. Oh, fuck. Okay. What about... All right. I'll use

1546
02:49:45,260 --> 02:49:59,899
the... Thanks for the tip. How much money do we make? Cry. Cry. Cry. You guys have said that before.

1547
02:49:59,899 --> 02:50:07,600
You guys have done that. 66 bucks. Let's go. What if I turn the stream on and just leave the desk

1548
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:28,129
and go to bed? Do it. Cry. Oh, I got to move this shit over. Cry. Cry. Cry. I got to get a webcam,

1549
02:50:28,129 --> 02:50:43,329
you're right. No more gambling. No gambling. I'm serious. No more $50 scratch tickets. I got to

1550
02:50:43,329 --> 02:50:50,700
get to over a thousand bucks. And hold on. I got to pay bills. Wait a second. This is bad.

1551
02:50:51,260 --> 02:51:07,870
Don't do it. Please go take a shit. I'm fine. Okay. We need to go to the bank. No, no, no, no,

1552
02:51:07,870 --> 02:51:11,469
no, no, no. I need to go to the bills app. I'm going to... Speaking of going to the bathroom,

1553
02:51:11,469 --> 02:51:25,790
I have to go to the bathroom right now. I have to do taxes too? Oh, man. I've got to do taxes.

1554
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:42,260
Today, zero dollars. Pay it. Okay. Electricity bill. What? Electricity bill due date of this

1555
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:52,450
penalty. Electricity bill. Fuck. It's taken all my money. I had to have the 200 bucks.

1556
02:51:53,090 --> 02:52:09,569
What about taxes? Didn't I just pay taxes? I'm hungry. I'll order something. Hold on.

1557
02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:21,100
2020. Taxes. Just like in real life. Due taxes. Total unrecorded money. Tax rate. We will send

1558
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:25,500
your current tax to you as an invoice every four days. I have to pay taxes every four days?

1559
02:52:26,219 --> 02:52:35,459
Tax rate. What's this? Value added tax. What is that? I have 9% tax rate, but I have to...

1560
02:52:35,459 --> 02:52:42,370
What's this value added tax? 4%. Don't companies pay that? Isn't that like a company thing?

1561
02:52:42,530 --> 02:52:52,959
Why is it an individual thing? It's an EU thing. But I thought like companies paid this.

1562
02:52:53,600 --> 02:53:03,860
Why do I have to pay that? Companies don't pay shit. What's up? Excuse me. By the way,

1563
02:53:03,860 --> 02:53:13,409
what's going on with that, by the way? Go to work. I'm going to work. By the way, 120 hertz. Thank

1564
02:53:13,409 --> 02:53:25,729
you. 1080 monitor. Is that some kind of currency thing? No. No work stream. I'm beating Dark Souls

1565
02:53:25,729 --> 02:53:40,930
today, guys. He's still at 144p quality. Yeah, and I still pull in the fucking big numbers.

1566
02:53:41,409 --> 02:53:53,340
My stream toxicity is at 120%. Why? What are these? Oh, I have 26 subs. Cool. That's way over the

1567
02:53:53,340 --> 02:54:02,459
limit. All right, guys. I have to be nice now. That's not accurate. You guys are calm. The mood

1568
02:54:02,459 --> 02:54:07,260
of the stream. Let's just chill. Chill. Chill. Everybody chill. Let's get that number down.

1569
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:20,979
Nice with the money. Everybody relax. We're just chilling today. Why is that toxic? I hate all of

1570
02:54:20,979 --> 02:54:32,059
you stupid nerds. I reported your stream. Why? Why are we so toxic? Everybody fucking relax.

1571
02:54:32,940 --> 02:54:37,280
It's boring. This stream is boring. I have two dollars. I cannot be a sub if I find money.

1572
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:49,180
Why is everybody like this right now? The toxicity is too high. How do I calm everybody down? I need

1573
02:54:49,180 --> 02:55:00,959
more viewers. I only have 30. What happened? Good morning. Legend is back. I'm losing viewers.

1574
02:55:04,739 --> 02:55:10,989
25? That's it? I'm gonna do something crazy. Oh, no. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.

1575
02:55:10,989 --> 02:55:17,600
Play music. Wait. Hold on. I'm trying to beat the game. Okay. Hold on. I'll get... Let's get...

1576
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:25,729
I know. Wait. Wait. I know I'm supposed to beat this, but hold on. Oh, shit. My tax rate.

1577
02:55:26,530 --> 02:55:37,600
I don't want you guys to see that. Hey, I know how much you guys love this shit.

1578
02:55:37,600 --> 02:55:46,959
We're gonna open some cases on stream. Oh, people like that one, don't they? I got a really slow

1579
02:55:46,959 --> 02:55:54,620
connection. 27 bucks. I cannot watch this stream, but I leave my support. Thank you very much. Thank

1580
02:55:54,620 --> 02:56:01,500
you, too. Thank all of you. I'm an idiot because I sent money. No, you're not. Cry. Cry. 10 out of

1581
02:56:01,500 --> 02:56:05,340
6. I don't know what that means. Thanks for the 10. Oh, thanks for the money. Just read them all

1582
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:09,020
quickly. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Here we go. Case opening.

1585
02:56:18,590 --> 02:56:27,069
Do not ban me. All right. Just minimize this. I got 78 people here, man. Come on. No,

1586
02:56:27,069 --> 02:56:35,700
minimize this. Okay. We're gonna open a super case today, guys. This is 50 bucks. We're looking for

1587
02:56:35,700 --> 02:56:49,299
blue. Come on. Give me that knife. Oh, too bad. Too bad. Too bad. Too bad. Dang. Oh, whoa. Thanks

1588
02:56:49,299 --> 02:56:58,940
to the subs, guys. I opened one case. Oh, offline subs. Pug. I've opened one case and end this

1589
02:56:58,940 --> 02:57:09,899
stream. I made it. How much money did I make? Seven. How is it 17 bucks? It's because Twitch

1590
02:57:09,899 --> 02:57:21,790
took 70. Twitch is taking 70. It's not Twitch. You spent it on cases. No, but that was... They

1591
02:57:21,790 --> 02:57:27,090
take... Didn't it say they take 70%? I didn't see what it was. Somebody tell me. Quick. Quick. Quick.

1592
02:57:27,090 --> 02:57:41,299
I didn't see. I didn't see. Somebody please. It's like a 10 second... Now he's just fucking with me.

1593
02:57:52,459 --> 02:57:58,879
Oh, my goodness. I don't have food. All right. I'm gonna go on a food shopping. I need a fridge.

1594
02:57:58,879 --> 02:58:12,959
I'm obsessed with this game. I can't stop. I'm gonna buy... I need a fridge. It's stressful.

1595
02:58:15,620 --> 02:58:19,299
If the donation's over 10, it goes to your bank automatically. Oh, okay. Yeah, but didn't it say

1596
02:58:19,299 --> 02:58:25,200
that they take 70, 80% of the money? It said that on the thing we were looking at, didn't it?

1597
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:41,809
In the very beginning? That's for subs. Oh. Let's get three burritos. Why don't I go... I just eat

1598
02:58:41,809 --> 02:59:03,500
burritos and donuts and canned mealworms. Why can't I go to the grocery store? Waiting for the food.

1599
02:59:03,979 --> 02:59:11,379
I gotta pee so bad. All right. Let me pee. I'll be right back. Gonna eat this and pee. And I'll sleep.

1600
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:23,020
Okay. How long does this last? What was it? Last storage on this thing. I just put burritos in my

1601
02:59:23,020 --> 02:59:30,899
backpack. They're fresh. Okay. It's probably fresh for a couple days. I would assume, right?

1602
02:59:31,620 --> 02:59:40,700
High genes. All right. Let's shower. Get some rest. All right. And I'll be right back. I have to

1603
02:59:40,700 --> 03:03:09,069
actually pee in real life. Be right back. Okay. It's hot in this room. It's hot in here.

1604
03:03:10,350 --> 03:03:19,139
Fuck Vegas. I'm moving. I'm out of here. It's too hot. I actually love it like this. I'm a

1605
03:03:19,139 --> 03:03:32,399
weirdo. I'm one of those insane people that really actually truly enjoys hot, hot, 100 plus degree

1606
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:45,680
weather. Let's go back. What are we doing? What the fuck are these mods doing? The whole chat?

1607
03:03:45,680 --> 03:04:04,270
Is something wrong with it? Next game, please. No. Sorry. What's the toxicity of this chat? Yeah,

1608
03:04:04,270 --> 03:04:13,840
I wonder. 40? Maybe 30? 40%? I need a better microphone too. I need more money. I need

1609
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:23,969
everything. Chubby bunny waiting room. It's happening tomorrow. You want your real fuckface

1610
03:04:23,969 --> 03:04:30,319
stream? It's going to be tomorrow afternoon. I sweated. This place is hot. It is. I like it

1611
03:04:30,319 --> 03:04:48,350
though. A billboard? Wait, can I advertise my stream on a billboard? What time are you going

1612
03:04:48,350 --> 03:05:02,270
to stream EU tomorrow? Probably around like 2 PM Pacific. That's, I don't know. That's, I don't

1613
03:05:02,270 --> 03:05:11,659
know. It'll be plus 10 hours plus 12 hours something EU midnight. You got to add 8 hours.

1614
03:05:12,299 --> 03:05:17,860
I live on the other side of the planet. I'm sorry. Add your ad to the various websites and video. I

1615
03:05:17,860 --> 03:05:28,770
can do advertising. Add duration one day. Do an ad for my stream for one day on the internet.

1616
03:05:28,770 --> 03:05:39,010
A billboard. One billboard for one day. Jerma. New concepts and fun streams are here. Hold on.

1617
03:05:39,010 --> 03:05:50,129
No, no, no, no. We need money. We need money. I need money. How we get money is we keep that stream

1618
03:05:50,129 --> 03:05:59,260
going. I need like two monitors for chat and stuff. What is this? All right. What was it?

1619
03:05:59,260 --> 03:06:05,780
Opening cases. People love that shit. All right. People love it. What can I do on stream that

1620
03:06:05,780 --> 03:06:17,659
people would like think is cool? We got to take a look first. Speed test bank. I could do scratch

1621
03:06:17,659 --> 03:06:29,139
tickets. Buy a house. All right. We'll play blackjack on stream, but not crazy amounts of money.

1622
03:06:29,139 --> 03:06:42,319
All right. Here we go. We're just going to be ASMR. I'll do that later. What's up, all you toxic

1623
03:06:42,319 --> 03:07:00,059
fucks? Today we're going to be playing the fart blackjack on stream. What is this? What amount to

1624
03:07:00,059 --> 03:07:09,819
be? What is this? I don't play blackjack. Oh, this is higher or lower toxic. We're reaching

1625
03:07:09,819 --> 03:07:16,989
levels of toxicity. You never thought possible. I'm going to give you guys some basic strategy.

1626
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:35,309
Or how to. We're going to do a base. We're doing one dollar bets in blackjack here. Wish I did a

1627
03:07:35,309 --> 03:07:40,350
fucking thousand. Wish I did a thousand guys. I wish it was a thousand. I just got blackjack.

1628
03:07:40,350 --> 03:07:48,350
First dollar bet. Right. I can't even tell. I want to teach you guys how to play. Keck W.

1629
03:07:52,260 --> 03:07:59,469
Stream I enjoy. Thanks for the sub. I got 33 subs. Thanks guys. Okay. So we're going to,

1630
03:07:59,469 --> 03:08:04,340
we'll see what we get for a hand here. We'll get 11 versus a four. Now if I was able to,

1631
03:08:04,340 --> 03:08:09,250
I would double down here. I would double down, but I'm not able to do that on this particular

1632
03:08:10,370 --> 03:08:15,069
game, but we're going to hit this. That's 21. These are dollar bets guys. It's just kind

1633
03:08:15,069 --> 03:08:23,020
of hanging out, having fun with you. Oh, thank you. A la qual for the subscription. Appreciate that.

1634
03:08:23,020 --> 03:08:35,180
Someone realizes that you are sleepless. I stayed up all night watching porn. Thanks for 10 bucks.

1635
03:08:35,180 --> 03:08:41,700
How could you tell that by the way, this streamer is very, he's a nerd. Yes. All right. Let's do,

1636
03:08:41,700 --> 03:08:49,459
let's get a little bit crazy here. Let's go for a seven, a $6 and 90 cent bet. Cause we're a comedy

1637
03:08:49,459 --> 03:08:57,969
guy here. We make lots of funny jokes. That's a 20. I'm looking to stand on 20 guys. Always stand

1638
03:08:57,969 --> 03:09:08,559
with the 20 versus anything like that. And we won again. Cool. Fuck. I banned the wrong guy.

1639
03:09:08,559 --> 03:09:24,610
All right. Everyone relax. We're doing $20 bet. I got a two. Ooh, 21. I am the king of blender.

1640
03:09:24,610 --> 03:09:31,620
You have to pay me taxes. We're getting 91 viewers right now. I got more subs. I didn't like you

1641
03:09:31,620 --> 03:09:39,059
before, but now I do. Toxicity is going up. Should I just run with that? Do something to entertain

1642
03:09:39,059 --> 03:09:58,850
the audience. It's just a good movie. Fucking do something. Fuck 16. Oh crap. Crap. I thought the

1643
03:09:58,850 --> 03:10:04,739
cops were just here. It's like, what the fuck happened? Okay guys, this is for you. This is

1644
03:10:04,739 --> 03:10:10,459
for the stream. This is the big one for the stream. We just passed a hundred concurrent viewers,

1645
03:10:11,920 --> 03:10:21,069
$50 bet for the stream. Oh, and it's a good one. Oh, it's not a good one. We have to stand here.

1646
03:10:26,899 --> 03:10:37,299
Too bad. Oh no. I lost some money. Ooh. Okay guys, I'm going to, uh, I got, uh, I got to go.

1647
03:10:37,780 --> 03:10:44,459
Oh wait, how long has the stream been off? How long was the stream off for?

1648
03:10:45,180 --> 03:11:06,510
Was I even streaming? I'm watching some sick fuck like this at 144 P at 700 bit rate talking like

1649
03:11:06,510 --> 03:11:15,600
that and losing some money and then just ending stream every day like that. This is bizarre.

1650
03:11:16,239 --> 03:11:29,659
At least I got some more subs. You never turned it on. Yes, I did. I was getting, I saw the

1651
03:11:29,659 --> 03:11:42,850
view account. What's wrong with your voice? Are you imitating somebody or are you actually asking

1652
03:11:42,850 --> 03:11:50,959
me that question? Turn the stream right now to 144 P 700 bit rate. I don't think I could do that.

1653
03:11:56,319 --> 03:12:01,219
I would have to read. I have to turn the stream off and back on again. All right. I will,

1654
03:12:01,219 --> 03:12:13,500
I promise I will do that before this stream is over. I have no money. Get a loan. Holy shit.

1655
03:12:15,840 --> 03:12:22,020
Daily installment payments of 800 bucks. That's not going to work. I'll do it. I promise I'll do

1656
03:12:22,020 --> 03:12:33,760
it. It will break everything. Yeah, guys, we're like hanging out, having a fun time. I'm not just

1657
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:36,639
going to turn the stream off because if I, here's the thing, this is what you guys, this is some

1658
03:12:36,639 --> 03:12:41,040
streamer insight for you guys. If I turn the stream off, even though, even though this boy,

1659
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:47,219
there's 10,000 people here, you all know that I'm coming back, but like 4,000 of you are gone

1660
03:12:47,219 --> 03:12:57,120
permanently. You're just going to leave. That's just how it works. I actually think it would be

1661
03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:02,079
that kind of a fun experiment to like turn a stream off and back on like 30 times and see

1662
03:13:02,079 --> 03:13:08,129
if you get down to zero. Will one person stick around after you go through? What's the diminishing

1663
03:13:08,129 --> 03:13:32,540
returns? I have to go to work. Have I eaten? All right. I'm okay. I would stay. Thanks. Okay. I mean

1664
03:13:32,540 --> 03:13:37,659
it. No more gambling. I would rather eat food on stream. I'm going to eat food on stream with

1665
03:13:37,659 --> 03:13:48,479
a webcam. That's the new meta. What do you mean gas is going to run out soon? I just got it.

1666
03:13:50,540 --> 03:14:25,659
Excuse me. Can I just buy gas? Yeah. I'm going to put it on ASMR, webcam, with food. I know, I know.

1667
03:14:29,469 --> 03:14:38,850
Someone siphoned gas from the car. I feel like they did. We want you to butt chug. Time that

1668
03:14:38,850 --> 03:14:44,610
person out for real. For at least two minutes. And I'm serious on that one. That's a serious,

1669
03:14:44,610 --> 03:14:49,170
that's a serious time that person out. We make that joke all the time. Oh, man, that guy. Oh,

1670
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:55,520
modem. Really time that guy out for two minutes. I want him to sit here and think. He's looking at

1671
03:14:55,520 --> 03:15:01,120
his screen saying, we want you to butt chug. I said that. I want this kind of butt chug. Yeah,

1672
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:10,739
I did say that. All right. I'm back. I'm back. I'm okay. I'm sorry for saying that. Start time.

1673
03:15:10,739 --> 03:15:19,040
What? I missed it? No, I got early. I'm really early. I'm so ready to work. Oh, God. I'm here

1674
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:26,559
two or three hours early. Is the restaurant even open yet? No, I'll be here. Hey, need somebody to

1675
03:15:26,559 --> 03:15:35,520
help clean the dishes and everything? I'm here. Oh, I know. I'll just tell people to come in the

1676
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:39,120
restaurant. I'll point at the restaurant and be like a dancing guy in a costume outside.

1677
03:15:39,120 --> 03:15:58,899
Go to the strip club. No, I'm not going to spend any money. This is eerie. Just standing out here.

1678
03:15:59,620 --> 03:16:17,309
Okay, hold on. Look out the back window. You know, kids typically when they look out the back window,

1679
03:16:17,309 --> 03:16:24,610
they go like, if you ever pull up behind a school bus at a red light, there's always like four or

1680
03:16:24,610 --> 03:16:31,950
five kids that are always like pointing at you out the window. And then you go like, oh, hey,

1681
03:16:32,430 --> 03:16:36,430
hey kids. You like cover your eyes and your ears and you go, and they go,

1682
03:16:38,959 --> 03:16:53,889
wave like out the window. Hey kids. I forgot to have to work. Right. And then when the light

1683
03:16:53,889 --> 03:16:59,969
turns green and three or four seconds go by and the school bus driver hasn't gone yet,

1684
03:16:59,969 --> 03:17:29,120
they didn't leave it to me. It's green light. Let's fucking go. Hey, easy. Oh, you're only,

1685
03:17:29,120 --> 03:17:34,260
you're only like nice and sweet into like, I think he's going to get away with that.

1686
03:17:36,700 --> 03:17:59,040
Does he? I need to guess. Yeah. Everybody's nice and sweet until. Can I please just say this line

1687
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:04,319
that I want to say? I just want to say a line. Everybody's nice and sweet until somebody sits

1688
03:18:04,319 --> 03:18:21,069
at a green light for four seconds. Okay. It goes from this cop has been riding on the sidewalk

1689
03:18:21,069 --> 03:18:29,139
the same every time. Fucking go. I'm hitting the button. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. Fucking

1690
03:18:29,139 --> 03:18:43,389
go already. That's why I have no gas. Can I work again? Can I work a good double? I have to take

1691
03:18:43,389 --> 03:18:56,979
an Uber home. It's 50 bucks. I love you. I thought he pulled up and was making that sound with his

1692
03:18:56,979 --> 03:19:15,340
mouth. It's an assassin. Oh shit. Thank God. Yes. Oh my God. I get burritos. I'm so hungry.

1693
03:19:15,340 --> 03:19:49,629
Trunk burrito. Still good. No, it wasn't. Come on. Please. I just want to go. Somebody push me.

1694
03:19:50,270 --> 03:20:18,829
Can I push the car? I can't push the car. I need to, I'm going to have to pay for the gas thing.

1695
03:20:19,709 --> 03:20:34,020
I'm going to get like five jobs. We're taking a streaming break. I need medicine. Fuck. Wait,

1696
03:20:34,020 --> 03:20:38,299
hold on. I'm going to take the rest of the computer parts out of that guy's house.

1697
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:57,069
Does he live? Where does that dude live? What was that guy's name? Wait, this is the hacker's house.

1698
03:20:58,620 --> 03:21:01,420
Is this the guy that's been hacking me the whole time? Why do I know where he is?

1699
03:21:02,139 --> 03:21:09,090
This is the guy that's been trying to break into my bank account for the last three months.

1700
03:21:09,809 --> 03:21:56,579
Where is he? I thought it was that guy. Wait, where is he? What? What's up? I just

1701
03:21:56,579 --> 03:22:00,340
wanted to ask you a couple of just questions about what you're doing and why you're doing this to me.

1702
03:22:00,899 --> 03:22:08,159
Okay. Uh, price to buy a, oh, this is a cryptocurrency miner. Are you the guy? You're

1703
03:22:08,159 --> 03:22:18,260
not the guy. You're not the guy. The BTC miner. How have you not been found out that you're back

1704
03:22:18,260 --> 03:22:37,409
here? I would, I'll get, I'll come back and get that in a little bit later. Yeah. He's dizzy. I

1705
03:22:37,409 --> 03:22:47,389
know I need medicine and I'm going to run out of gas again. I need gas. Where's the gas station?

1706
03:22:47,389 --> 03:22:50,590
How am I? Oh, this car sucks. What's the miles per gallon on this fucking thing? This thing's

1707
03:22:50,590 --> 03:23:14,559
terrible. Okay. I got gas. We got to turn, go back up and then go down that road. So back up

1708
03:23:18,100 --> 03:23:40,420
and take it. Okay. Let's go. Wait. I'm gonna go stream. What's going on? What? Does this car

1709
03:23:40,420 --> 03:23:56,989
have a leak? I don't, I just bought a quarter tank of gas. I didn't, I went down the street.

1710
03:24:00,670 --> 03:24:05,340
Level up in the skill tree. Oh shit. All right. Yeah.

1711
03:24:06,139 --> 03:24:17,219
Rash meter. I don't have enough money. No gas. Yeah, that's fucked up.

1712
03:24:18,180 --> 03:24:23,120
You will die after your bladder finally says fuck you and explodes.

1713
03:24:24,020 --> 03:24:31,729
You've been on a hundred toilet. All right. I have a plan. Here's my plan. I'm not going to

1714
03:24:31,729 --> 03:24:37,790
fucking work again. I'm not going to work. I'm going to go home. I'm going to stream every day.

1715
03:24:38,350 --> 03:24:43,729
I'm not going to open cases. I'm just going to play fucking fall guys and people are going to

1716
03:24:43,729 --> 03:24:48,770
eat it up. I'm going to make a thousand dollars over the course of a week. Then I'm going to fill

1717
03:24:48,770 --> 03:24:52,979
my car up with gas. I'm going to use the bathroom to buy a bathroom. I'm going to order some pizzas

1718
03:24:52,979 --> 03:25:09,809
and shit and I'm going to be fine for now. I, I have, I have to get home 50 fucking bucks. What

1719
03:25:09,809 --> 03:25:18,129
a joke. That's a plan. Yes it is. So I need food. I need to go to the bathroom. What do I have in

1720
03:25:18,129 --> 03:25:27,139
my wallet? I need to transfer some money to my wallet so I can go to the bathroom in this outhouse

1721
03:25:27,139 --> 03:25:33,469
and then I need medicine too, but I'm okay. I've got 14 health. Okay. Hold on.

1722
03:25:35,870 --> 03:25:38,829
Read these out loud. Just, okay. There we go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

1723
03:25:38,829 --> 03:25:51,360
Okay. 47 bucks from my stream lab. Now I need to go to the bank. I gotta pay bills too. Shit.

1724
03:25:51,360 --> 03:26:02,479
I think I saw Zerma at the grocery store and he went like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Buy a toilet.

1725
03:26:02,479 --> 03:26:21,250
I will get necessities. I promise. Electrical interference. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going

1726
03:26:21,250 --> 03:26:28,159
to put some money in my wallet if I can. I know you need medicine. Just hold out a little longer.

1727
03:26:28,159 --> 03:26:51,229
He's going to stream one more day. How can I get money from his bank account? Like why can't the

1728
03:26:51,229 --> 03:26:59,280
hack backfire and I take a hundred bucks from his account? Okay. Transfer to wallet. Let's transfer

1729
03:27:00,079 --> 03:27:03,040
just 10 bucks to the wallet. It's enough to go to the bath. No, 20 bucks. I have to go to the

1730
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:25,459
bathroom twice. Just buy a toilet. The toilet is $400. I can't afford it. Oh, good. All right.

1731
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:45,459
I need to buy a new house too, but slow. Baby steps. I need to order some food. I got plenty

1732
03:27:45,459 --> 03:27:54,299
of food. All right. We're locking myself up here. Two burritos. I know. We're going to get two

1733
03:27:54,299 --> 03:28:05,709
burritos and some canned food. Not getting to the second game. No, no. I'm locked in here. I like,

1734
03:28:05,709 --> 03:28:18,940
love this. I'm having a blast. What am I doing? Oh, food. Right, right, right. Get three burritos

1735
03:28:18,940 --> 03:28:28,500
and some beans and just keep them in the desk. Please move on. This isn't fun. I'm playing it.

1736
03:28:29,139 --> 03:28:38,299
Are we both playing this game at the same time? Are you playing it too? I know. I thought this

1737
03:28:38,299 --> 03:28:48,219
isn't fun. Ban that guy permanently. No, we don't ban. We did no permanent bans here. Oh,

1738
03:28:48,219 --> 03:28:55,979
yes, there is. It's a lie. All right. Two clam soups and a couple of burritos and a couple of...

1739
03:28:55,979 --> 03:29:17,469
What lasts? Beef jerky lasts like forever. Get two of these. Get fat. Somebody called me fat,

1740
03:29:17,469 --> 03:29:23,340
right? Somebody was like, oh, you've become obese. I was like, how the fuck do you know that?

1741
03:29:27,680 --> 03:29:30,399
We're streaming enough to get medicine and then we're going to stream permanently.

1742
03:29:32,370 --> 03:29:45,760
It was, you are obese on the computer. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Clam soup. Eat it. Burrito.

1743
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:51,340
Eat it. Let's... Okay. Eat this clam soup because that will probably not keep very well.

1744
03:29:51,899 --> 03:30:02,909
Hundred. Store the rest in my backpack. Does it matter if it hits the ground? I hope not.

1745
03:30:12,209 --> 03:30:27,250
Somebody said European taxes and American healthcare. Okay. Let's stream. I need

1746
03:30:27,250 --> 03:30:44,500
medicine. I know. I'm working on it. Let's go. What's going on, sinners? It's me, German985,

1747
03:30:44,500 --> 03:30:54,209
coming at you with another live stream. Just, whoa, hold on a minute. Okay, everybody. I want you to

1748
03:30:56,530 --> 03:31:13,389
relax while we... Shh. Everybody breathe in and breathe out.

1749
03:31:31,219 --> 03:31:39,440
Fuck this stream. What? Is it loud? Oh, it's actually going. I don't have both earphones in,

1750
03:31:39,440 --> 03:31:51,149
guys. I only have my right one in. I didn't know that... Hold on. I'm getting a ton of donations.

1751
03:31:51,149 --> 03:32:53,860
I have to keep doing it. I feel dizzy. Where's the toilet one? Which one is toilet? Okay. Thank you

1752
03:32:53,860 --> 03:33:06,700
for your subscriptions. We've got 44. It's 19. Is there a lottery? How we had so much toxicity.

1753
03:33:07,020 --> 03:33:39,170
Relax and enjoy the tingles. Thank you. Click. Estabator for the subscription.

1754
03:33:39,170 --> 03:33:47,420
Bonesie Prime, thanks for the sub. Thank you for the three dollars and one cents. I say I love you.

1755
03:33:47,420 --> 03:33:56,690
Oh, I'm not going to say you too, so you can go fuck yourself. Valti, thanks for the sub. I made

1756
03:33:56,690 --> 03:34:05,659
my coffee. This is a shit stream. Okay. Good stream. Thanks to Pog. Appreciate it. I love you

1757
03:34:05,659 --> 03:34:10,059
very much. I'm preparing a surprise for my darling. Read my name. Do you say your lover...

1758
03:34:11,260 --> 03:34:47,760
Is this live? Yes, it is. Wake up. Stream is over. How much money do we make today from our ASMR

1759
03:34:47,760 --> 03:34:54,739
stream? Oh, 50 bucks. All right. Same thing tomorrow. I got backpack full of burritos.

1760
03:34:54,739 --> 03:35:14,780
That was a madhouse laugh. I will pay you any amount of money to never do that again. Okay.

1761
03:35:14,780 --> 03:35:32,239
The amount is $500 million. Okay. Back at it again. Eat the food in my inventory and then

1762
03:35:32,239 --> 03:35:40,100
let's go. This is a little dirty. That's okay, right? I'm kind of afraid to eat this with 11

1763
03:35:40,100 --> 03:35:56,370
health. I'm going to sell it to the fucking guy. Yeah, let's sell it. I'm terrified. I have 11

1764
03:35:56,370 --> 03:36:07,219
health. Even if I lose like five, that's really bad. Five bucks. I'll take it. I'll take it. Let's

1765
03:36:07,219 --> 03:36:35,739
go. Do I need to use the bathroom? I do. I don't have any money. Why? How are we doing? Okay. I've

1766
03:36:35,739 --> 03:36:43,620
eaten. I'm going to have some beef jerky. How is this dirty? It's beef jerky. If I lose health,

1767
03:36:43,620 --> 03:36:54,239
I'm going to be mad. Oh shit. There's even more in here. I don't know. That's pretty awesome,

1768
03:36:54,239 --> 03:37:02,620
actually. All right. Store that. Only buy beef jerky. It's like the best food ever, apparently.

1769
03:37:03,180 --> 03:37:18,770
All right. I'm back. We're not doing ASMR. We're doing a creative stream today. Okay. Let's do

1770
03:37:18,770 --> 03:37:24,239
some paintings. I'm not going to be reading any sub or chat messages today, guys. I'm concentrating

1771
03:37:24,239 --> 03:37:47,780
on my art. Thank you, whoever that was. Just drop the pen. Uh, that's an eraser. Okay. Hold on. I

1772
03:37:47,780 --> 03:38:23,090
need to... Why do we keep climbing with toxicity? This is so annoying. Good morning. I'm just trying

1773
03:38:23,090 --> 03:38:45,579
to draw a face. Next pen. I need medicine. I'll get it after this. Looking for a favorite streamer?

1774
03:38:45,579 --> 03:38:54,879
That's going to be me. I guarantee it. All right. Can I sell this to one of the viewers?

1775
03:38:54,879 --> 03:39:07,579
Or can I sell this? Xeric opened a stream. Let this disgusting stream. How do I lower this?

1776
03:39:08,540 --> 03:39:16,209
Am I just that unbearable? People are giving me money, though. I'm getting a ton of money.

1777
03:39:16,209 --> 03:39:22,750
Look at all these subscriptions and... Look at all this. This is crazy. This is a sub train.

1778
03:39:23,309 --> 03:39:34,670
This is a huge amount of subs. Okay. That was cool. Now let's erase this and let's make a new one.

1779
03:39:34,670 --> 03:39:41,069
The legend is back. That's right. Here I am. This is going to take too long to erase. So I'm just

1780
03:39:41,069 --> 03:39:56,350
going to go like this and let's... Here. You want to see my bank account? Still at 144p. I'll show you

1781
03:39:56,350 --> 03:40:11,790
guys my bank account on stream. Here's my actual thumbprint. I have 56 bucks. I'm going to transfer

1782
03:40:11,790 --> 03:40:22,690
money to my card. I have like 80 bucks or so. I want to watch me get a loan on stream. 500 bucks.

1783
03:40:22,690 --> 03:40:25,729
I have three days to pay it off. I'm never going to be able to do that. That's way too much.

1784
03:40:26,690 --> 03:40:32,479
More subs. I know everybody in Blender. I see you first stream. How long has the stream started?

1785
03:40:32,479 --> 03:40:51,489
How long do you have been doing this for a job? Sorry. Mic off for now. He's a waiter. Look who it

1786
03:40:51,489 --> 03:41:04,610
is. Nod. Nod P. Getting hacked on stream but blocked him. Still streaming this. Okay. Stream's

1787
03:41:04,610 --> 03:41:25,020
over. I want to play one of the other games. Why did I install fall guys? I need medicine though.

1788
03:41:27,100 --> 03:41:34,959
Okay. I've got 92 dollars. That's not enough. I think I have to just get lucky at blackjack.

1789
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:49,170
Eat some beef jerky. Go to bed. Loot again. I can't uninstall fall gang. I want to play counter

1790
03:41:49,170 --> 03:42:04,700
strike or fifa. Can I? Wait. Computer. Oh. Hold on a second. Can I go in there and take it out?

1791
03:42:08,510 --> 03:42:13,440
No. No. I don't. Wait. I don't have a microphone. No I do. Okay. I was like wait a minute.

1792
03:42:13,440 --> 03:42:25,469
All right. Let's eat food and go to bed. Where's my beef jerky? Did I have two? I thought I had

1793
03:42:25,469 --> 03:42:42,030
two of these. No. Take out a massive loan and then do a hand in blackjack for all of it.

1794
03:42:42,030 --> 03:42:50,430
I don't know. I think that's a really really bad idea. Go look in trash and see if you can

1795
03:42:50,430 --> 03:43:00,860
find anything. Nothing in this trash. All right. I'm gonna go look around all the dumpsters.

1796
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:13,329
Nothing in here. I want to buy like a cat and have a dog and stuff. I need to make some money.

1797
03:43:14,049 --> 03:43:29,100
Any more trashes to look through? You have to press space? Take trash. Space. There's nothing

1798
03:43:29,100 --> 03:43:50,579
here. Move. Whoa. Does this hurt? I think that might hurt. No. All right. We're good. This is

1799
03:43:50,579 --> 03:44:04,399
free shit. It is. Oh a gas bottle. Oh a plastic crate. I don't have any more motivation to be in

1800
03:44:04,399 --> 03:44:12,770
the trash anymore. What do these things do? This is a. I can sell it to a dealer. I can sell it to

1801
03:44:12,770 --> 03:44:20,620
a dealer. I can sell these to a dealer. Gonna make some money. Zero hygiene. He's gonna be mad. Take

1802
03:44:20,620 --> 03:44:43,360
a shower. Maybe I can trade him for some medicine. What's up? I got some things for you to look at.

1803
03:44:43,360 --> 03:44:48,399
I've got a water bottle for you to look at. Nine bucks. I've got a gas canister. That's a lot of

1804
03:44:48,399 --> 03:44:53,040
money and a plastic crate. I think we can have make a little bit better of a deal there I think.

1805
03:44:53,600 --> 03:45:14,049
Fuck you. More trash? Nice. Oh how do I get more trash motivation? I think it's a skill point.

1806
03:45:14,049 --> 03:45:24,319
Garbage motivation decreases more slowly. How much is it? I don't have money to do that.

1807
03:45:24,319 --> 03:45:37,540
Back on the stream. Oh you know what? I think I'm gonna take like five jobs. Yeah. I'm gonna try to

1808
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:51,229
make like 500 bucks in two days. Freelancers. What's this? Gamble a loan you idiot. Imagine

1809
03:45:51,229 --> 03:45:59,379
telling somebody saying the words gamble a loan and then a space bar and then writing you idiot.

1810
03:45:59,379 --> 03:46:09,920
Oh coding? Do I know how to code? You should get a key by finding capital letters and numbers from

1811
03:46:09,920 --> 03:46:16,479
within the scattered code block. You must enter the keys by typing code at the beginning. Get a key

1812
03:46:17,040 --> 03:46:20,879
by finding capital letters and numbers within the scattered code. So I need capital letters

1813
03:46:20,879 --> 03:46:29,739
and numbers in here. Okay. So then I type in code and then wherever you have to look. Let's go.

1814
03:46:30,299 --> 03:46:54,500
Here we go. We've got eight. Eight V. Eight V V. Eight V V five. Eight V V five. Wait eight.

1815
03:46:54,500 --> 03:47:12,989
There's another one. Eight V V five. Eight V V. Wait eight. Code eight V V J eight. Eight V V J

1816
03:47:15,459 --> 03:47:45,139
F five. That's it. It does say code. Got it. Three. Three. Uh zero. Um O. Okay. N. And uh

1818
03:48:16,940 --> 03:48:51,329

1819
03:48:53,120 --> 03:49:17,020
F. What do you see? F. I don't see an F. Blind. Hold on. A. P. E. P. There's nothing here. That's it.

1820
03:49:18,319 --> 03:49:26,239
Oh I thought it had to be five. R. F. This is actually really easy to make a bunch of money.

1821
03:49:26,239 --> 03:49:45,729
We just do it. Put R. F. E. B. Um done. That's uh 95 dollars. Let's do it again. This one is 115 bucks.

1822
03:49:45,729 --> 03:50:06,739
Are you kidding me? Let's go. This is where you make the money. That's it. Oh fuck. What was that?

1823
03:50:06,819 --> 03:50:40,670
That was fucked up. Okay. Uh E. E. Uh A. E. A. What's the next one? E. No. D. E. What? What's

1824
03:50:40,670 --> 03:51:12,610
the next one? D. Oh shit. You can get them wrong. J. M. J. J. S. J. S. M. Look for numbers too.

1825
03:51:12,610 --> 03:52:00,540
Is that it? J. S. V. M. Okay. Y. W. K. Uh Y. W. K. A. Oh come on. That was wrong? Eight. O. Y. Five.

1826
03:52:02,959 --> 03:52:20,719
X. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Knock out. 74 dollars. Let's go. This is so easy. We can finally

1827
03:52:20,719 --> 03:52:46,540
buy a toilet if we want. PG-6 and no. PG-6. PG-6 code. We're playing a middle-aged office

1828
03:52:46,540 --> 03:52:54,020
worker simulator. No. We're losing viewers. I'm making money man. Why don't you stream this?

1829
03:52:54,020 --> 03:53:06,739
Holy shit. You're right. This is double money. This is making double money. I can't believe I

1830
03:53:06,739 --> 03:53:22,510
didn't think about that. We'll do that tomorrow. I think that's good. That's it. You can't hack me

1831
03:53:22,510 --> 03:53:39,379
in the middle of doing my own hacking. Hi Luke. Good to see you again. How are the kids? How are

1832
03:53:39,379 --> 03:54:18,450
you? Same time next week? Cool. See you then. U. B. Nine. Z. No. X. A. E. Okay. X. There's a three

1833
03:54:18,450 --> 03:54:49,010
there. X. R. Three. There it is. Fuck. I'm so bad at this. Five. R. B. A. U. Thank you. 42 bucks.

1834
03:54:49,010 --> 03:54:53,979
All right. We'll do this tomorrow on stream. What's my bank account look like? That's probably

1835
03:54:53,979 --> 03:55:00,219
most money I've ever had. Yeah. Look at that. 280 bucks. Good. We'll do it on stream tomorrow.

1836
03:55:00,219 --> 03:55:16,100
I'm going to order some food and we'll go. Legit working. Yeah. But it's all good man.

1837
03:55:16,739 --> 03:55:25,649
Don't even look at this stuff. Beef jerky only. Do we even pay bills anymore?

1838
03:55:26,700 --> 03:55:37,549
I want to. I want to. I want to. Thanks to you this stream. I looked up what Yankee Doodle was

1839
03:55:37,549 --> 03:55:51,520
and I learned about macaroni. Okay. We're going to get a pig and then beef jerky. I got a lot

1840
03:55:51,520 --> 03:55:59,680
of unready meals. Okay. I need to pay bills. That person's right. They probably overdo.

1841
03:56:03,250 --> 03:56:05,569
Get better internet. There's a lot of things I want to get.

1842
03:56:07,260 --> 03:56:17,459
Bills. Why is beef jerky more expensive than a whole... I can't even talk. I'm sorry.

1843
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:22,239
Words that just have trouble coming out sometimes. I'll get it in a second.

1844
03:56:22,239 --> 03:56:28,299
Let's leave it at the door. No bills. Can I see some pogs in the chap and no bills?

1845
03:56:28,860 --> 03:56:34,530
You know I've started to really like that word pog. I'm older than a lot of you guys,

1846
03:56:34,530 --> 03:56:44,909
but you know it's fun to say sometimes. Okay. Let's put the store these on the shelf.

1847
03:56:47,899 --> 03:57:02,479
That better not be dirty. Where did that go? Are you fucking kidding me? Just keep it in my backpack.

1848
03:57:02,479 --> 03:57:11,379
I don't care. Where'd it go? Can I take a bath? I got to use the bathroom too. Don't touch my beef

1849
03:57:11,379 --> 03:57:22,399
jerky. It's out here. It's mine. Don't touch this. All right. We're going to wake up tomorrow. We're

1850
03:57:22,399 --> 03:57:34,420
going to dig through the trash. We're going to eat some medicine. Sounds good. I have plenty of

1851
03:57:34,420 --> 03:57:44,959
energy. What am I doing? Turn the stream on. Let's go. Let's turn the stream on. Today we're

1852
03:57:44,959 --> 03:57:52,270
doing just chatting and I'm going to do coding on stream. Welcome everybody. How are you? Bear with

1853
03:57:52,270 --> 03:58:02,479
the hearing. We're going to do some coding. I left for an hour and he's still in this dump.

1854
03:58:02,479 --> 03:58:11,809
This game is, it's a slow burn, but I like it. Okay. Freelancer. I can't, I don't understand this.

1855
03:58:14,020 --> 03:58:34,129
I am a boomer. Okay. Coding. Check it out guys. We're going to be coding on stream. Z, F,

1856
03:58:35,340 --> 03:58:48,260
five. This is a very boring stream, isn't it? So you have a five J.

1857
03:58:54,219 --> 03:59:06,819
Fuck it. I fucked it up. I screwed it up. Hey, VOD watchers, skip 20 minutes. All right. That's

1858
03:59:06,819 --> 03:59:29,860
what they should be saying. Okay. Uh, three. H three J, H three R, six R, J. Someone realizes

1859
03:59:29,860 --> 03:59:36,270
that you are sleepless. I'm sorry, but I'm coding right now. Leave me be. Did I do that job right?

1860
03:59:36,270 --> 03:59:52,819
I did. Okay. Code four. I'm making triple money. This is the way to do it. G. I'm getting a lot of

1861
03:59:52,819 --> 04:00:24,299
money. Two. Oh my fucking God. It's all right. The donations are still coming in. Is it? Hey,

1862
04:00:24,299 --> 04:00:31,739
what do you think about that? I know everybody in the blender. See the first, I think the 18 plus

1863
04:00:31,739 --> 04:00:35,340
chatting. People wonder what you think about the shape of the world. The world is flat. The world

1864
04:00:36,139 --> 04:00:53,889
is flat. We're going to do, we're going to, okay, sure. The world is flat stream over F, A, S, E,

1865
04:01:00,530 --> 04:01:14,159
20 bucks. That's not even worth doing this. 10 bucks worse than FTK. Get out of here.

1866
04:01:15,360 --> 04:01:33,469
I'm scrolling over my chat. I'm going to ban you. All right, let's go medicine. All right. I can

1867
04:01:33,469 --> 04:01:52,940
buy the medicine. 200 bucks. That's such a bum. That's such a money sink. I need money. Ah,

1868
04:01:53,579 --> 04:02:06,670
let's say he's a, this guy's a positive streamer. I'm not as toxic as this guy.

1869
04:02:07,229 --> 04:02:16,190
All right. So I said, you guys are about 30, 40% toxic on that meter. Where am I? Over 50,

1870
04:02:16,190 --> 04:02:48,219
under 50, 50%. There's nothing in there. How can you have nothing in there? Just crap. Take it.

1871
04:02:51,200 --> 04:03:05,489
Fuck, whatever. I'll just sell it to him. Why is there even a wallet in the game? Why can I just

1872
04:03:05,489 --> 04:03:19,260
swipe my credit card into the lock? All right, let's go sell this stuff to this guy. And then

1873
04:03:19,260 --> 04:03:23,899
I actually am going to go and see if I can go take some computer parts out of that guy's house.

1874
04:03:23,899 --> 04:03:46,750
I'll take pills. Get a better house. You see how much of a struggle it has been for me to keep

1875
04:03:46,750 --> 04:03:55,379
$50 without blowing it on beef jerky and CSGO cases? You think I'm going to get like

1876
04:03:55,379 --> 04:04:03,139
hundreds of thousands of dollars? Short stream today of me transferring money into my wallet.

1877
04:04:03,139 --> 04:04:25,870
Just a quick one. Short stream of me just transferring money. What's the cap?

1878
04:04:26,430 --> 04:04:42,690
Okay. Let's transfer to my wallet. Let's just put like 50 bucks in here and then let's transfer.

1879
04:04:43,409 --> 04:04:54,530
Okay. We're good. No, I need 200 total money in wallet, total money on the card. Transfer

1880
04:04:54,530 --> 04:05:03,840
this money back to my account. Give me transfer to wallet. Okay. Let's go get that medicine.

1881
04:05:17,569 --> 04:05:26,909
The stream is still on. Okay. What am I stupid? Why wouldn't I just turn the stream on

1882
04:05:27,629 --> 04:05:39,379
and fucking leave and go to work? What if the computer gets hacked?

1883
04:05:40,420 --> 04:05:51,600
You'll get hacked. Has it happened yet? Hey guys, I'm back. Childhood memory. Say you were a very

1884
04:05:51,600 --> 04:06:04,819
clever baby. Tell the memory you pissed underneath. Okay. How much money do I got? I'm going to keep

1885
04:06:04,819 --> 04:06:09,700
like I'm keeping money on my wallet because seriously I need it. I put gas and all that.

1886
04:06:12,159 --> 04:06:24,290
Thanks guys. 84 viewers. I need to buy a webcam. That's really important. I have enough money to

1887
04:06:24,290 --> 04:06:49,059
buy a webcam. Oh man. Somebody gave a lot of money. Who gave a lot of money? Just read them

1888
04:06:49,059 --> 04:07:06,030
all on stream and they'll keep coming. Okay. I closed the stream. That's fine. I'll take the

1889
04:07:06,030 --> 04:07:10,829
160 bucks please. Awesome. Now we're making moves. This is where it really gets, this is where it's

1890
04:07:10,829 --> 04:07:20,219
going to be good. How much is a fridge? How much is a shitty fridge? 200 bucks. I can afford that.

1891
04:07:20,219 --> 04:07:42,110
I can afford it. Fridge and a webcam. 112. God, Luke just picked somebody else to do this to.

1892
04:07:44,500 --> 04:07:58,659
Anybody else but me. Luke, I'm just going to move. I'm going to get a new house anyways. All right.

1893
04:08:00,739 --> 04:08:08,420
Ball? Webcam? This one here is 112 bucks streaming for webcams. I need 312 bucks. All right. Let's

1894
04:08:08,420 --> 04:08:29,309
put that on the credit card. Level up. That's a fridge and a webcam. You need a toilet. Streaming

1895
04:08:29,309 --> 04:08:38,909
comes first. Do I have any food? I do. Is this dirty? It's a little dirty. It's okay. It should

1896
04:08:38,909 --> 04:08:56,819
be fine. Yeah, that's good. I got any money on the wallet? No. But I'm just like, my underwear is

1897
04:08:56,819 --> 04:09:10,159
sagging behind me. Like Santa's knapsack. Like Santa has all your presents in there. Go to sleep.

1898
04:09:10,159 --> 04:09:26,829
Well, that's the grossest thing you've heard all day. Come on. It's been four hours. I'm a little

1899
04:09:26,829 --> 04:09:49,059
gross, but not that gross I don't think. There's a wheel in here. That fridge is huge. Can I fit

1900
04:09:49,059 --> 04:09:57,920
this fridge in my house? It's as big as a doorway. Oh, dude, we're going to have a streamer fridge.

1901
04:09:58,479 --> 04:10:13,180
What an ugly fridge. That's the worst streamer fridge ever. Oh, and I can sell that. A Red Bull

1902
04:10:13,180 --> 04:10:18,989
fridge. No, this is the, this is the fridge that, so if you have a, if you buy a new fridge,

1903
04:10:19,629 --> 04:10:23,629
this is the fridge that becomes the second fridge that ends up in your garage.

1904
04:10:23,629 --> 04:10:36,510
All right. Let me go. I need, I can buy a bunch of food now. That's the best part about this.

1905
04:10:36,510 --> 04:10:40,659
I can actually buy food. I don't know why, but for a second, I thought this was a second fridge

1906
04:10:40,659 --> 04:10:52,350
lying down. I can buy and store food. Oh, thank goodness. A webcam. Get this shit on here. And

1907
04:10:52,350 --> 04:11:13,459
I'm doing a webcam stream to test it out. Let's have the donations roll to fucking. All right.

1908
04:11:13,459 --> 04:11:22,670
Settings. Full screen cam. Show cam. Recommended bit rate. Stream settings. Full screen camera.

1909
04:11:29,170 --> 04:11:37,899
Wait. Hey guys. Welcome to stream. I'm taking you guys on a, oh, you can't do that. It's all

1910
04:11:37,899 --> 04:11:54,190
right. If I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back. I got a cam now. What do you guys think? Thank you.

1911
04:12:01,600 --> 04:12:11,260
I can't change this. What is this even a picture of? This isn't the wrong spot. This isn't a

1912
04:12:11,260 --> 04:12:17,389
terrible spot. Wait, can I move the camera? Nice fucking slideshow. Wait, I have an idea.

1913
04:12:17,950 --> 04:12:43,790
Be serious. My computer's disconnected. I turned off the computer with a shitty stream.

1914
04:12:49,780 --> 04:13:01,620
Oh, that's so stupid. Can I get a chair that's not a baby high chair?

1915
04:13:02,260 --> 04:13:10,739
Turn it on. What's wrong with the computer? Stream in the bathroom. Oh, you give me ideas. I wait

1916
04:13:10,739 --> 04:13:32,959
till I have my own house. Sorry guys. That's my fault. I screwed up a little bit. I'm back.

1917
04:13:36,579 --> 04:13:47,040
Can you see me? Please fix this. What's wrong with it? Misuse other streamers to attract viewers.

1918
04:13:47,040 --> 04:13:58,930
I mean, just how many people are coming in? 40% of stream. This game is so fucking. Talk about

1919
04:13:58,930 --> 04:14:02,770
artistic things to improve the quality of the stream. Talk about beautiful pictures.

1920
04:14:02,770 --> 04:14:14,829
Art is boring. All right. Let's talk about beautiful pictures. I need to point the webcam

1921
04:14:14,829 --> 04:14:26,530
at my face. Stream trend. Focus on your own chat. Tell a story. Let's tell a story. Where are the

1922
04:14:26,530 --> 04:14:38,110
donations? Oh, here we go. It's time to do a joke. Cheap joke. Clever joke. Great stream. Thank you.

1923
04:14:38,829 --> 04:14:43,809
Oh, I can pretend there's a sub train so people will just start to subscribe because they think

1924
04:14:43,809 --> 04:14:51,899
it's a sub train that's going on. Whoa, dude. Oh, that's not even. I thought that was real.

1925
04:14:54,159 --> 04:15:07,389
People say that they are bored. This is too real, man. This is too real for me.

1926
04:15:11,260 --> 04:15:16,590
If you never make money on streaming, will you keep doing it? That would do it for fun.

1927
04:15:18,879 --> 04:15:25,090
Huge viewer count. All right. I got something crazy. What do I do? This is the most viewers I've

1928
04:15:25,090 --> 04:15:40,180
ever had. What is what movie you like? I don't know. Action. Viewers are skyrocketing. I want

1929
04:15:40,180 --> 04:15:46,159
to be a streamer, but the blender refused. Oh fuck. That was pretty good though. That was

1930
04:15:46,159 --> 04:15:57,059
almost 200 concurrent viewers. That's a big deal. Put your face cam on the game's monitor.

1931
04:16:02,340 --> 04:16:21,120
Yeah, I can't put it anywhere. I want to put it right here. Put it on the shelf.

1932
04:16:21,760 --> 04:16:32,700
Look, I can't do it. Look. See? And by the way, what images is this even taking? Why is it not

1933
04:16:32,700 --> 04:17:00,430
showing me? Do a feet cam? I don't think I can even do that. Come on. All right. Let's go. Stream

1934
04:17:00,430 --> 04:17:09,870
outside your house. I need better internet. I need money too. This game is actually pretty hard.

1935
04:17:09,870 --> 04:17:20,079
It really is. Try to get a better stream quality. Yeah, but I drop. People go drop, drop, drop

1936
04:17:20,079 --> 04:17:24,610
frames. This stream sucks. Loser. All right. Let me dig. Let me do some trash digging.

1937
04:17:25,250 --> 04:17:54,079
Damn it. Yeah. I need better internet first. Come on. All right. Do you want this weird wheel? How

1938
04:17:54,079 --> 04:18:06,989
much is this worth? Well, bucks. I have to take it. All right. Now is the time where I'm going to

1939
04:18:06,989 --> 04:18:12,430
take a bunch. I'm going to take like a bunch of jobs that at least two jobs that I can go to

1940
04:18:12,430 --> 04:18:28,670
back to back. Let's take a look at our bank account. 118 bucks. I feel like I'm always

1941
04:18:28,670 --> 04:18:38,799
at 118 bucks. It's always at one to 200. Okay. Stream. Hmm. What can I do here?

1942
04:18:39,360 --> 04:19:01,069
Buy a toilet. I need 400 bucks. I want to just gamble. What is fast net? Well, here's the thing.

1943
04:19:01,069 --> 04:19:11,899
How much more is the better internet package? It might not be that much more. Hold on. This

1944
04:19:11,979 --> 04:19:20,909
is the package that I have. Two down, one up. This is four down, one up. That sucks. $20

1945
04:19:20,909 --> 04:19:30,530
for four every four days. Or I can do turbo. You can buy a maximum of one turbo package every day.

1946
04:19:30,530 --> 04:19:38,610
So hold on. This is I, if I stream with that's 300, that's $33,000. All right. Let me get ready

1947
04:19:38,610 --> 04:19:45,020
for that. I need to eat. I'm going to get sleep and I'm going to turbo boost and do an insane

1948
04:19:45,020 --> 04:20:18,100
IRL stream. I'm going to order some food. Turbo boost into the bathroom. What are your opinions

1949
04:20:18,100 --> 04:20:30,219
on this emote? Let's see. Is that a bag on somebody's head? What is that? All right. Let's

1950
04:20:30,219 --> 04:20:36,270
get food, cheap food that I can put in the refrigerator. Let's get some sodas, three sodas,

1951
04:20:36,989 --> 04:20:52,020
two waters, an energy bar, some apple juice. Somebody once told me the world was

1952
04:20:52,500 --> 04:20:57,620
going to roll me. I'm sorry. It's the first thing I thought of. I'm sorry. I know everyone's going

1953
04:20:57,620 --> 04:21:01,540
to do that. Everyone's going to say, yeah, it was terrible, but come on. I had to do that.

1954
04:21:02,420 --> 04:21:06,899
I had to do that. Stop treating me this way or I'll start banning everybody.

1955
04:21:10,670 --> 04:21:20,799
Don't make fun of me. I'm in control here. All right. That's enough for now.

1956
04:21:21,739 --> 04:21:38,979
No, you dick. Okay. I don't understand the internet. Okay. You put Shrek on the screen

1957
04:21:38,979 --> 04:21:43,299
and have that song playing in the background and everybody pogs their pants and plus two,

1958
04:21:43,299 --> 04:21:47,629
holy shit, the best thing I've ever seen in my life. You just sing the song and you're an

1959
04:21:47,629 --> 04:21:56,370
asshole and let's put his head in the guillotine. It's like they both have to be combined for that

1960
04:21:56,370 --> 04:22:04,219
to work, I guess. Bunch of clam soups. All right. Complete payment. We're going to fridge this shit

1961
04:22:04,219 --> 04:22:18,930
up. Pog needs to be banned. Why? Why do you want to ban Pog? We haven't even clicked on the deep web

1962
04:22:18,930 --> 04:22:27,899
app. By the way, if you see an app that says the deep web app, don't click it. It's not really the

1963
04:22:27,899 --> 04:22:38,100
deep web. This website is built on a blockchain that cannot be followed. It cannot be followed,

1964
04:22:38,100 --> 04:22:49,520
but every move you make leaves a new trace. Please pay attention to your steps. You cannot

1965
04:22:49,520 --> 04:22:55,629
sell online for security reasons. You can get a minor device. Okay. Backdoor hack. After the

1966
04:22:55,629 --> 04:22:59,709
hacking attack, if you have backdoor hacking, you can hack the person who hacked you. What?

1967
04:23:00,510 --> 04:23:12,299
Wait, we can finally get our revenge on Luke, the hacker. Okay. I need to get some BTC.

1968
04:23:12,299 --> 04:23:17,489
It's too much to do in this game. I have to focus on one thing at a time. This is like the ADHD

1969
04:23:17,489 --> 04:23:33,280
nightmare game. All right. Perfect. This is a soda. Drink it up. Crackers. Delicious. All right.

1970
04:23:33,280 --> 04:23:46,260
Put the burritos in the fridge. Put us all in the fridge, actually. And then what was I going to do?

1971
04:23:46,260 --> 04:23:58,979
Something very specific. BTC. No, no, no. Something else. Oh, the web boost. Right. The web boost

1972
04:23:58,979 --> 04:24:17,360
can do a one-time only super stream. All right. Store this out. Into the fridge it goes. Well,

1973
04:24:17,360 --> 04:24:32,610
why did I just zip my pants? Use the toilet urgently. Don't worry. I'm going to make sure

1974
04:24:32,610 --> 04:24:39,309
that the stream that I do, I'm going to be fully washed and fully bathroomed. Don't worry. I promise.

1975
04:24:39,309 --> 04:24:46,079
All right. We've eaten. I actually should probably have a little bit of apple juice.

1976
04:24:48,000 --> 04:24:57,280
I love apple juice. 100. Cool. All right. I got pretty good health. Let's put 10, let's put 20

1977
04:24:57,280 --> 04:25:01,409
bucks in my bank account in my wallet so I can go pay the guy to use the bathroom. And we'll go from

1978
04:25:01,409 --> 04:25:16,690
there. And we're going to get the super boost internet and I'm going to turn the stream on

1979
04:25:17,250 --> 04:25:38,100
and we're going to get a huge amount of people. Okay. 9K Andy. You're on this shit again. All

1980
04:25:38,100 --> 04:25:42,610
right. Where's the bathroom? All right. I'm going to finally use the bathroom. It's been a week.

1981
04:25:43,329 --> 04:26:03,379
Thank you. Appreciate it. Take a shower. Close the fucking door. I want to be left alone right now.

1982
04:26:03,379 --> 04:26:10,959
Internet boost and I'm going to play Dark Souls. No ASMR gave us way more money. No way. Yeah.

1983
04:26:10,959 --> 04:26:16,829
ASMR gave way more money. We do ASMR for like four hours. Just turn that turn the volume. Guys,

1984
04:26:16,829 --> 04:26:22,819
it's the biggest money maker. Just turn your volume down a little bit. Fast net. Let's go.

1985
04:26:22,819 --> 04:26:40,079
Turn off the VPN. Oh shit. All right. So this is $20 every four days. This is two megabits up.

1986
04:26:40,079 --> 04:26:59,809
This is double what we have now. We just do the soup, the big one. This is three. All right. It's

1987
04:26:59,809 --> 04:27:04,860
going to be worth it. I'm going to make a bunch of money. This is a big one. Oh, I have a ton of

1988
04:27:04,860 --> 04:27:15,780
internet now. Okay. OBS. Just start the stream. I don't even care what it is. At least you wait

1989
04:27:15,780 --> 04:27:29,309
until I'm done with a sentence. He never interrupts me. He always just waits for a sentence break.

1990
04:27:29,309 --> 04:27:37,969
Turn the stream on. Okay. OBS. Stream settings. Normal camera. Go cam. Normal cam.

1991
04:27:38,530 --> 04:27:45,870
We're going to save this stream. 2200 bit rate. We can do that. Quality. We're going to go to 360p.

1992
04:27:45,870 --> 04:28:02,239
We're going to go 360p. Don't save the stream. 60 FPS. 30 FPS at 2700. This is big deal.

1993
04:28:02,799 --> 04:28:17,149
Let's go. What's up? How's everybody doing? How do you like the quality? Pretty good, huh?

1994
04:28:23,680 --> 04:28:31,569
There are people in chat who write without using their brain. Welcome to life. All right. How do

1995
04:28:31,569 --> 04:28:37,100
you like it? How's the quality? What do you think of the shape of the world? The world is geo it.

1996
04:28:37,100 --> 04:28:50,540
I don't know what that means. No drop frames either. No donations. This is a, this is a boost.

1997
04:28:50,540 --> 04:29:01,950
I need money. Stream control. Chat only. Video rendition stream. What? Video rendition. I have

1998
04:29:01,950 --> 04:29:11,020
to do something. Where's my camera? Oh, there it is. Full cam. People love the full cam.

1999
04:29:11,739 --> 04:29:29,920
Let's go to ASMR. Turn your headphones down. Turn your headphones down. Here comes the donations.

2000
04:29:29,920 --> 04:30:04,860
Read them all. Rate stream. Subscribe. Subscribe. Subscribed. Fan the wrong guy. Whatever.

2001
04:30:04,860 --> 04:30:11,790
We're about to break 200 viewers. 200 viewers. Here comes the 200. Come on. Do it. And I could

2002
04:30:11,790 --> 04:30:25,940
get partner at 400. Big money coming in. This guy's only got one trigger. Okay. Is this a big

2003
04:30:26,020 --> 04:30:41,069
Great Dane shaking his head around? Read the fucking donations. Hold on. I love you. Hey,

2004
04:30:41,069 --> 04:30:45,149
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Thanks for the 20 bucks.

2005
04:30:45,149 --> 04:31:09,280
I love you. Thanks for the sub. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. And when,

2006
04:31:09,280 --> 04:31:16,350
when you guys come back, remember, it's me, the fat fuck IRL. Come back next week and I'll

2007
04:31:16,350 --> 04:31:23,409
shake my stomach around for you more after drinking three Gatorades. You know you love it.

2008
04:31:23,969 --> 04:31:39,760
Thanks for the sub. About to break a hundred. Wait, we're going to break a hundred. We can,

2009
04:31:39,760 --> 04:31:54,879
we can apply for partner at a hundred subs. Right? Come on. Somebody sub. Somebody sub.

2010
04:31:54,879 --> 04:32:00,110
Somebody sub. Toilet break. Please. Just somebody sub and I'll do it. What's your favorite color?

2011
04:32:00,110 --> 04:32:08,899
Green. Thank you. What does it say? Hello. Hello. How are you? Thanks for the sub. Ooh,

2012
04:32:08,899 --> 04:32:21,680
thanks for the sub. I told you ASMR kills it. 102 subs. We're going to apply for partner.

2013
04:32:21,680 --> 04:32:31,409
12 bucks. This is a big deal. Okay. Is it really good to just grab a bunch of shit on my desk and

2014
04:32:31,409 --> 04:32:38,020
just knocking it around and just go like, I bet, you know, I'd probably be a really good ASMR

2015
04:32:38,020 --> 04:32:54,159
streamer. Think about that. I could probably just sit there and be like, I'd make a million

2016
04:32:54,159 --> 04:33:12,700
dollars in a day. Oh, Hey, we've got some money. Can you say my darling's name? Hey kitty. Thanks

2017
04:33:12,700 --> 04:33:26,000
for the sub. This is fucking torture. Whisper, please. Someone stole my credit card and subscribe

2018
04:33:26,000 --> 04:33:32,380
to you. How would you even know that? Read my message. We're at 300. Come on. We're at 300

2019
04:33:32,860 --> 04:33:38,900
years. We can get higher than this. We can get high in this. No, that was right. That was up.

2020
04:33:38,900 --> 04:33:56,659
I was right in the middle of the big deal. Right. Killed it. Okay. Here we go. Let's see if I can

2021
04:33:56,659 --> 04:34:05,779
apply for partner. Become a partner. Join in the I'm ready. I'm in the approval process. I just

2022
04:34:05,779 --> 04:34:11,729
applied average viewers, total subs, total followers. Hey, I got the average. I got the subs,

2023
04:34:11,729 --> 04:34:36,770
total followers, 400, 107 subs, expected earnings, 283. What? All right. Tomorrow I'm getting up early

2024
04:34:36,770 --> 04:34:44,799
and we're going to do an ad. I'm going to do an ASMR ad stream. What the hell was I doing? Okay.

2025
04:34:44,799 --> 04:35:01,889
I got a lot of money. 154 bucks. Not bad. Tomorrow. We're back tomorrow. Donation said to stream while

2026
04:35:01,889 --> 04:35:24,400
you sleep. Yeah. I'm going to get hacked. I need to hire mods. Oh, okay. Please change the stream

2027
04:35:24,400 --> 04:35:36,139
title from aces only. Don't even own counterstrike. Okay. We're going to do a 90 second ad every 90

2028
04:35:36,139 --> 04:36:06,619
seconds and see what happens. No, that's too, that's, that's, that's okay. Whatever. Who cares?

2029
04:36:06,619 --> 04:36:17,549
Come on, ban me. Will I get to see my name pop up here eventually? I'm supposed to be right here.

2030
04:36:17,549 --> 04:36:28,900
I'm supposed to be right here. I'm right here. What the fuck? Did I get it? No, I got, I got

2031
04:36:28,900 --> 04:36:37,979
declined. It's cold. What do you mean cold? Is it, has it been, has it winter time? What year is it?

2032
04:36:40,849 --> 04:37:03,119
All right. I'm going to have some burritos and a water. Refreshing. Not bad. All right. Nice and

2033
04:37:03,119 --> 04:37:21,950
hydrated. Let's go use the bathroom. Punch the water. All right. Now I have my boost, right?

2034
04:37:21,950 --> 04:37:27,009
Okay. I'm ready. Same deal. What I said, I said I was going to do, uh, I'm going to run a bunch

2035
04:37:27,009 --> 04:37:40,349
of ads, do ASMR because it kills new title, show cam, start that stream, stream settings.

2036
04:37:42,509 --> 04:37:46,909
God damn it, Luke. Luke, one of these days, I'm going to hit you back hard.

2037
04:38:00,060 --> 04:38:09,860
Okay. We're back. Okay. Let's run ads. Wait, don't run ads yet. Wait till there's like a bunch of

2038
04:38:09,860 --> 04:38:18,560
people here. What's my stream look like? Okay. I got my full camera pointing at nobody apparently.

2039
04:38:18,560 --> 04:38:40,060
Let's get those triggers going. This is very cold. Here comes the subs. 23 bucks. I love pizza.

2040
04:38:40,060 --> 04:38:49,069
Thanks for the $7. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. Put the music on too.

2041
04:38:49,069 --> 04:39:18,580
Music on an ASMR stream. That seems kind of odd, but I, okay. Okay. Shaking to the beat.

2042
04:39:19,540 --> 04:39:48,990
I'm so bored. I just go into a stream and have the fat guy naked, shaking his stomach to the beat of the song.

2043
04:39:50,110 --> 04:40:04,209
And you say that you're bored. It's boring. Boring. I need to run ads. Just run them again.

2044
04:40:27,470 --> 04:40:31,229
This guy would fuke. This guy would fucking fuke.

2045
04:40:34,220 --> 04:40:43,840
I can't do it very much longer, everybody. I can only have five E-rates before I throw up.

2046
04:40:48,830 --> 04:41:08,189
400 concurrent viewers. Viewers, sweat up. Oh, too much. Too much. Too much. Slow down.

2047
04:41:09,150 --> 04:41:40,020
He's tapping on his stomach. Oh shit. How much money did I make? $24.

2048
04:41:40,659 --> 04:42:00,080
So much toxicity. Funny. Funny. Cry. Cry. Cry. Subscribed. That's it?

2049
04:42:02,400 --> 04:42:09,569
Like shaking my stomach around to the music? Come on, man. Really? It shouldn't be like that.

2050
04:42:17,549 --> 04:42:25,740
We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again tomorrow.

2051
04:42:25,740 --> 04:42:28,700
We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again. We're going to do that again tomorrow,

2052
04:42:28,700 --> 04:42:36,610
but we're going to go even higher quality. I need to go to sleep first.

2053
04:42:50,939 --> 04:42:55,840
Get the turbo? You have the better internet route. Just get the turbo today.

2054
04:42:58,319 --> 04:43:04,720
Fucked up stream. Okay. Eat. And then I'm putting some cash on my wallet so I can

2055
04:43:04,720 --> 04:43:19,020
go out there and use the toilet. Pay taxes. I can buy a toilet? No. Why would I buy a toilet

2056
04:43:19,020 --> 04:43:24,430
if things are going so well? I just need some money on my wallet. Just buy a toilet. Fine.

2057
04:43:24,430 --> 04:43:38,020
All right. I'll buy a damn toilet. I have 500 bucks. All right. We need to have another song.

2058
04:43:38,020 --> 04:43:45,020
Another like shake juggle ASMR tap the stomach stuff. People loved that stream. That's their

2059
04:43:45,020 --> 04:43:55,680
favorite stream. We're going up to HD quality. 720p coming up. Full screen camera. And we're

2060
04:43:55,680 --> 04:44:02,610
saving this one. And it's going to be 60 FPS. 120 FPS. You're going to be able to see the

2061
04:44:02,610 --> 04:44:11,580
jiggling stomach, slow motion, the wrinkles and shit. How much do I need? I need 8,700. What

2062
04:44:11,580 --> 04:44:19,459
do I have? Three? I can't do it. We're going to have to stay with 60 maybe. What's the boost?

2063
04:44:20,099 --> 04:44:32,479
It's three. With the turbo boost it'll be five. What's six? All right. Maybe we're not ready for

2064
04:44:32,479 --> 04:44:44,000
60 FPS yet. All right. I've got 99% energy. I'm ready. Wait. Don't do it yet. I need to go to the

2065
04:44:44,000 --> 04:45:19,680
bathroom. Buy the toilet. There. This is just what he does. And people love it. We can run ads too.

2066
04:45:20,400 --> 04:45:25,200
Minimize this. All right. That looks okay. We'll go come back here. I just want to go. I need to

2067
04:45:25,200 --> 04:45:33,500
buy toilet. Hasn't paid bills or taxes in years. Just juggles his stomach to the beat naked on

2068
04:45:33,500 --> 04:45:40,740
Twitch. Stop saying Twitch because it's not. Blender. Let's just put $500 bet right now on

2069
04:45:40,740 --> 04:45:47,150
Blackjack and then end the stream. All right. Mods. Let's see if we can get this. Hire a moderator

2070
04:45:47,150 --> 04:46:05,389
for stream. Own number of moderators to be hired. One is $5. Let's get two. Five dollars to mod.

2071
04:46:07,790 --> 04:46:25,439
That's the salary. Change the ban rate. Where's my $5? Ban rates. Mod ignores. Mod ban machine.

2072
04:46:25,439 --> 04:46:40,720
Balanced. Oh. Well, they're going to be pretty soft. Okay. I'm going to buy the fast net booster.

2073
04:46:41,439 --> 04:46:48,959
After I buy a toilet. God. I can't even pay attention to anything. I'm going to pee again.

2074
04:46:48,959 --> 04:46:58,959
We're going to pee one more time. Toilet. The cheapest shittiest one I can get. You're just

2075
04:46:58,959 --> 04:47:09,470
pissing it. Who cares? Finally have a toilet. We still have $288. Are we going to do a green screen?

2076
04:47:10,110 --> 04:47:28,500
Are we going to put a small ram in here? Green screen. Softbox? No. I can't afford this.

2077
04:47:29,060 --> 04:47:36,000
How are we doing on everything else? All right. I need to eat something.

2078
04:47:36,720 --> 04:47:43,060
I'm going to eat this last meal and I'm ready. I'm going to do it again. This time super boosted.

2079
04:47:43,619 --> 04:48:04,450
I need a gamer chair. I kind of do, don't I? Take a shower. Okay. Time to buy it. Buy the

2080
04:48:04,450 --> 04:48:20,380
boost. 5k up stream. Toilet. I don't think the toilet's here. Doesn't take a day to deliver.

2081
04:48:22,860 --> 04:48:37,310
That's not here yet. Webcam. Here we go. Turbo. Upload plus three. So this is, that's 6k.

2082
04:48:37,950 --> 04:48:50,720
I got the boost. I'm at 6k up right now. So we can do 60 FPS. Damn it. We can't. 30 FPS.

2083
04:48:50,720 --> 04:49:00,740
We'll do 6,000 up. Save this stream. Dreamsetty's full screen camera. ASMR. Let's get the music

2084
04:49:00,740 --> 04:49:19,540
ready. What's the song? Hello everybody. Welcome back to Juggles the Great's 140th stream of his

2085
04:49:19,540 --> 04:49:26,619
career. I just wanted to be the first to welcome you and say I love all of you and I love the subs

2086
04:49:26,619 --> 04:49:32,700
and I love the bits and I love all the money that you give me. I love you too.

2087
04:49:34,669 --> 04:49:41,220
Watching while eating. Oh, I ate a lot earlier. I ate a lot earlier if you could already tell.

2088
04:49:44,340 --> 04:49:49,619
So if I do, please do announce the next song we're going to be doing this afternoon.

2089
04:49:51,569 --> 04:49:59,700
I'm up. I'm ready. I'm stretched. Are you ready? Are you ready?

2090
04:50:01,310 --> 04:50:08,659
Mods, take care of some of these little assholes. Coming up next on the track we have.

2091
04:50:09,709 --> 04:50:15,229
Palm Avenue. This is going to be a good one. Hope you're all ready. Okay.

2092
04:50:23,330 --> 04:50:41,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to get a little sweaty. So what the hell's happening? Somebody's hacking

2093
04:50:41,090 --> 04:50:47,299
me. Hold on everybody. Just everybody calm down for just a minute. We'll take care of this piece

2094
04:50:47,299 --> 04:51:00,369
of shit. CWC. Oh, I blocked his ass. We're okay. We're good. Where was I?

2095
04:51:01,330 --> 04:51:18,529
All right. Sometimes I forget what I do here. Hey, do you like zootubers? Of course I love

2096
04:51:18,529 --> 04:51:26,849
zootubers. I love them. You know, I used to be a zootuber myself. Don't forget me in the future. I

2097
04:51:26,849 --> 04:51:37,599
won't gastroscope. I will not forget you. Of course I would. Hey, y'all want to see somebody

2098
04:51:37,599 --> 04:51:47,729
eat something? No, I don't have any food in the fridge. Somebody gave some money. Let's check out

2099
04:51:47,729 --> 04:51:53,840
who that was. Hey, what do you say we really get this poppin', huh? I needed another song.

2100
04:51:57,040 --> 04:52:32,000
Ah, we need some bigger, bigger than that. It's tough to hurt after a while, but I do it for you.

2101
04:52:32,959 --> 04:52:46,529
Ah, I love everybody here. We're just going to get partner suit. Oh, good night. I'm going to bed.

2102
04:52:47,569 --> 04:53:07,060
I didn't run ads. Shit. This dude gets banned. This dude gets banned every day. He just makes

2103
04:53:07,060 --> 04:53:15,549
a new account and he titles his stream the same thing so everyone knows where to find him. If he

2104
04:53:15,549 --> 04:53:20,669
look, think about that. If he titles every single one of his streams, juggles the great stream number

2105
04:53:20,669 --> 04:53:27,569
142 tomorrow, right? If he just makes a new account, he's just going to make people know what to look

2106
04:53:27,569 --> 04:53:45,360
for. Upload that VOD. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. It'd be copycats. You'd find the real

2107
04:53:45,360 --> 04:53:54,779
thing. All right, publish that video. How's it doing? I wish we could watch this video.

2108
04:53:56,130 --> 04:54:04,189
Okay, the video's three hours and 36 minutes. That is a very, very long time to be doing that.

2109
04:54:04,189 --> 04:54:13,299
All right, I'm going to piss. I'll be right back. Actually, like not in the video game.

2110
04:54:13,299 --> 04:56:10,689
Give me one sec. Uh, did you guys say there was a raid? Did I miss a raid earlier? It was.

2111
04:56:10,689 --> 04:56:32,020
It was a juggles raid. Oh, I see. Okay. Let's get back to this here. So that's our video. I'm tired.

2112
04:56:32,900 --> 04:56:37,540
Speaking of getting paid, let's see how much money that stream made. I didn't,

2113
04:56:37,540 --> 04:56:45,060
I couldn't even see the stream labs. Holy shit. Look at this. I can't even scroll up far enough.

2114
04:56:45,060 --> 04:56:52,369
26, eight, 10 bucks. People love juggles the great. This is awesome. How much money might

2115
04:56:52,369 --> 04:57:04,909
get paid? 68. Let's see though. Dude. Holy shit. Oh, actually it was all right. I thought that was,

2116
04:57:05,549 --> 04:57:09,790
I thought I was. Sorry. Sorry. I gained a lot of traction. I gained a lot of traction. I bought a

2117
04:57:09,790 --> 04:57:29,939
toilet. That's right. I didn't run the ads stake. You got to play some games. Juggles is a wholesome

2118
04:57:29,939 --> 04:57:38,930
streamer. He doesn't play ads. Yeah. Let's take a look at the skill tree. I have money.

2119
04:57:38,930 --> 04:57:45,659
My goodness. There's a toilet finally. I don't have to pay anybody anymore.

2120
04:57:58,740 --> 04:58:12,020
All right. And yeah, let's get some light in here. X garbage motivation decreases more slowly.

2121
04:58:12,020 --> 04:58:15,389
That's a hundred. That's, I don't know. I don't know about that. I feel like I don't even want

2122
04:58:15,389 --> 04:58:24,590
that. I'm going to get it though. Open extra slots in your inventory. That's a lot of money.

2123
04:58:25,310 --> 04:58:30,689
Number of miners you can buy and decrease your YouTube video upload limit.

2124
04:58:31,250 --> 04:58:34,180
How did they, did they expect me to have this much money?

2125
04:58:39,229 --> 04:58:44,669
What is this? Item transfer and use of inventory items are much faster. That's kind of pointless.

2126
04:58:45,819 --> 04:58:50,779
Get a BTC miner. I just, I don't know. I need money again. I think I got this thing going with

2127
04:58:50,860 --> 04:59:05,650
the juggles. Oh, that'd be fucked. I need food. Let's buy some. You know what? I also need another

2128
04:59:05,650 --> 04:59:16,319
hard drive. The video made 10 bucks. No, what? Re-upload it. No, re-upload it. Oh, come on. I

2129
04:59:16,319 --> 04:59:41,889
didn't get paid. What a misclick. That was one of his best streams. All right. I need to get,

2130
04:59:42,610 --> 04:59:46,849
what am I buying here? I need food. I also need something else to do. What do I need?

2131
04:59:48,340 --> 04:59:57,500
He keeps talking about how hard it is. Hard drive. Right. Okay. HDD and SSD. Something cheap.

2132
04:59:58,220 --> 05:00:11,310
175 bucks right here. Okay. I need to buy this. Somebody said completing a game lets you delete

2133
05:00:11,310 --> 05:00:31,500
it from your hard drive. I got to pay bills too. Oh, very overdue. Very overdue. This one's due

2134
05:00:31,500 --> 05:00:43,040
today. We got a stream today. We got a stream right now. We got a stream right now. Impromptu

2135
05:00:43,040 --> 05:00:59,470
stream. Let's go. Hey, everybody. It's me. Juggles are great. You know what we do here.

2136
05:01:18,880 --> 05:01:22,159
What's the problem? What's the problem here? What's going on? What are you talking about?

2137
05:01:22,159 --> 05:01:33,970
Drop, drop. Please fix. Fix what? Oh, what the fuck? Oh, what the fuck? What's going on with

2138
05:01:34,450 --> 05:01:41,200
the internet? I don't know. How do I fix this? Oh, let me sit down. Let me sit down for this.

2139
05:01:44,290 --> 05:01:53,389
I ate two cakes today for this impromptu stream. Fix, fix, drop. Do you hate YouTubers?

2140
05:01:53,389 --> 05:02:01,919
Fucking ban that guy. He's annoying. All he does. How do I fix it though? Drop, drop, drop. Hello,

2141
05:02:01,919 --> 05:02:09,020
swearing prohibited. Shut the fuck up, man. Hey, thanks for the money. I said my internet

2142
05:02:09,020 --> 05:02:15,869
is in my computer. Maybe I need a better computer. All right. Well, sorry. I'm really

2143
05:02:15,869 --> 05:02:19,869
sorry everybody that this is happening. But the computer I don't know. I don't know what's

2144
05:02:19,869 --> 05:02:29,040
happening here. Fucking get out of here. I do what I can how we normally do. But I can only do so

2145
05:02:29,040 --> 05:02:50,849
much with the computer. Sorry about that. I just I'm gonna run a few ads. Maybe we'll shake around

2146
05:02:50,849 --> 05:02:58,209
a little you know, like you guys. We don't need that much stream power for that. I don't think

2147
05:02:59,259 --> 05:03:05,490
I'm gonna write a couple ads. Take a take a minute and see if the internet kind of gets better. Oh

2148
05:03:05,490 --> 05:03:14,639
shit. These are due today. Hold on just a minute. I'm gonna run a few ads and you'll just support

2149
05:03:14,639 --> 05:03:20,750
the stream support. You know me shaking around. I know how everybody has ended that I'll see you

2150
05:03:20,750 --> 05:03:33,340
soon. Hey, how the fuck am I gonna fix this bullshit? Hold on. I'm turning this off. No,

2151
05:03:33,340 --> 05:03:39,790
no, I don't want to show that. I don't want to show that. Fuck is that any personal information

2152
05:03:39,790 --> 05:03:49,869
on there? I hope not. Hold on to me. I don't know what I did. I screwed something up. But we got

2153
05:03:49,869 --> 05:03:56,189
when we get I'll be back tomorrow though. I promise you. We'll do well ended out on a good one here.

2154
05:03:56,189 --> 05:04:04,580
I'll see you guys. I don't know what's happening. This is fucking God damn it, man. I am starving.

2155
05:04:06,819 --> 05:04:17,810
Fuck dumb, stupid ass fucking stream. Drop frame stream close. Fuck. You know how much I

2156
05:04:17,810 --> 05:04:21,569
fucking ate today to do this and how much I had to get this ready. Everyone's expecting me to be

2157
05:04:21,569 --> 05:04:30,419
here. Looking over the chat. Yeah, great. What the fuck? What the fuck? Professional streamer

2158
05:04:30,419 --> 05:04:38,180
professional streamer, huh? If only they fucking knew. I'm upset too. They don't think I'm mad

2159
05:04:38,180 --> 05:05:24,669
about this too. Well, I did it. I prepared for it. So I'm gonna fucking do it. You like that one?

2160
05:05:24,669 --> 05:05:43,740
God fix my fucking internet tomorrow or I'll be pissed. We've been in a virus game like four

2161
05:05:43,740 --> 05:06:02,340
hours. I was using this stream to test the slime guy bit. What? I thought that was me doing that

2162
05:06:02,340 --> 05:06:29,759
again. It's going up. There's so many viruses. I have to pay my bills, dude. 20 bucks. I didn't

2163
05:06:29,759 --> 05:06:36,049
get any money from that stream. Course I did. Okay. 123 bucks. They look at thank you. They

2164
05:06:36,049 --> 05:06:40,450
supported him. They know he's got to pay his bills and I know he shakes around for their

2165
05:06:40,450 --> 05:07:11,119
entertainment. 500 fucking viruses. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. Found him. Who is this

2166
05:07:11,119 --> 05:07:17,119
guy eating cheeseburgers? Why does he have bold cheeseburgers with the buns on the grill with

2167
05:07:17,119 --> 05:07:32,560
the buns? I feel like that's not good. I feel like that's not gonna be very good. That's Randy from

2168
05:07:32,560 --> 05:07:55,709
the trailer park boys. Okay. That was the wrong link. What is going on here? What the hell is

2169
05:07:55,709 --> 05:08:05,500
you? What is this? Did you make this? What is that image? Hey I got all the viruses are gone.

2170
05:08:06,139 --> 05:08:17,229
Now I gotta pay bills. What happens if you just don't pay them? Expected earnings. 386 bucks.

2171
05:08:17,790 --> 05:08:30,060
Payments are coming out tomorrow morning. Apply for partner. Come on. I had it. Look I got 137 subs.

2172
05:08:31,709 --> 05:08:41,020
44 bucks from ads. 165 live viewers concurrently. Come on. You need a thousand followers? What's up

2173
05:08:41,020 --> 05:08:54,590
with that? There were 500 people here on stream. I bring in the numbers. They can't get enough of

2174
05:08:54,590 --> 05:09:16,189
that. They want 400 concurrent. Fine. Buy some food. 800 follower Andy. Buy a bunch of burritos. They're

2175
05:09:16,189 --> 05:09:39,220
the most filling. Upload that stream. That's a good idea. Back to zootube. Go on fucking Zornhub or

2176
05:09:39,220 --> 05:09:56,799
riot. You're gonna have to riot. I'm afraid of seeing like a naked lady on it or something.

2177
05:09:56,799 --> 05:10:19,060
$50 burritos. Well $50 is in. I'm right there. Burrito delivery. Thank you. Zero energy. Twitch

2178
05:10:19,060 --> 05:10:38,700
mod said do it. They did? Hold on. They did. Wait. Wait. What do you mean a Twitch mod? You mean one

2179
05:10:38,700 --> 05:10:50,560
of my mods or do you mean a Twitch like staff member? Staff said it. Wait a minute. I want to

2180
05:10:50,560 --> 05:11:06,689
confirm this. Twitch staff just told me to do this. I didn't see it. Yep. Zornhub time. I just

2181
05:11:06,689 --> 05:11:11,810
okay. I just got confirmation from Twitch staff to go to Zornhub. Okay. I'm telling you. I just saw

2182
05:11:11,810 --> 05:11:53,099
it. I hope you didn't get hacked. What is this? This is my character? This is just like drawings

2183
05:11:53,099 --> 05:12:12,020
of people. How is this Zornhub? This is just like the cast. This is like a Wikipedia page for

2184
05:12:12,580 --> 05:12:31,939
any anime you could probably come up with. Okay. Click one. I just did. Keep going. Keep going.

2185
05:12:31,939 --> 05:12:44,419
I'm so tired. I need to rest. We did get confirmation from Twitch staff that like I

2186
05:12:44,419 --> 05:12:53,490
could do this. I'm not playing the fire anymore. I'm not holding a lighter up to my hand and going

2187
05:12:53,490 --> 05:13:01,779
ow ow. I'm not doing that shit. I'm not holding my hand up to a lighter. Just to see if it hurts.

2188
05:13:02,340 --> 05:13:15,409
That was 50 bucks. Great. Now I can't eat tomorrow. Boxbox said it was okay. Did he? He hates

2189
05:13:15,409 --> 05:13:40,220
anime. No. I just. I don't know. How many of these are there? What is this? And why do you

2190
05:13:40,220 --> 05:13:48,700
have the worst fucking website in 2020? It's just an infinite scroll with no text. No nothing. It's

2191
05:13:48,700 --> 05:14:08,060
just an infinite scroll of anime characters. It hurts my finger to do this. I'm scrolling as fast

2192
05:14:08,060 --> 05:14:20,639
as I can. All right. We've made it to the end. Cool, I guess. This is just like a League of

2193
05:14:20,639 --> 05:14:36,299
Legends character skins. Who is this? This is not worth $50. But I mean, I'm going to stream it real

2194
05:14:36,299 --> 05:14:50,580
quick. I'm going to stream this tomorrow. Dude, there was a raid. There was a raid. There's like

2195
05:14:50,580 --> 05:15:06,110
12,000 fucking people here right now. We had like 9,200 people like 40 minutes. Did Boxbox raid?

2196
05:15:06,110 --> 05:15:09,549
All right. Okay. Twitch staff, you got to look into this. No, this has nothing to do with you

2197
05:15:09,549 --> 05:15:13,869
guys. This is streamlabs. How come it doesn't say that Boxbox raided? The same shit happened.

2198
05:15:13,869 --> 05:15:20,849
Welcome, everybody. Thanks for the raid, Boxbox. Sorry that when you raided last. It almost happened

2199
05:15:20,849 --> 05:15:29,020
again, by the way. Almost happened again. Almost just somehow complete. Because it's like, hey,

2200
05:15:29,020 --> 05:15:36,369
Boxbox said it was okay. Oh, okay. Boxbox, I like him. I like Boxbox. Wait, Boxbox raid. Oh,

2201
05:15:37,340 --> 05:15:52,979
I idiot. 2k viewers left. That's what happens during a raid. You come to the stream, you go,

2202
05:15:52,979 --> 05:15:58,319
oh, cool. Then you leave. All right. Let's sleep. I'm going to get up tomorrow and we're going to

2203
05:15:58,319 --> 05:16:08,540
stream. I'm going to do a gameplay stream tomorrow. You forgot about the bills. I can't pay them. I

2204
05:16:08,540 --> 05:16:17,790
don't have enough money to pay the bills, man. Let's see. Oh, shit. Yeah, I do. I got my payout.

2205
05:16:20,459 --> 05:16:27,840
Pay bills and then stream Zornhub without a mic. Just me scrolling. We'll see how many subs we

2206
05:16:27,840 --> 05:16:45,630
can get. I was about to do it. I can't do it. All right. Mods. We're going to change the mods.

2207
05:16:45,630 --> 05:16:53,869
Ban rate balanced. We'll have four mods. Get the stream ready. Make sure I got, have I eaten?

2208
05:16:54,590 --> 05:16:59,790
I should do my toilet urgently. Yeah, I'm going to eat. Let's have some burritos

2209
05:17:04,529 --> 05:17:12,220
and let's go to the bathroom. Now, seriously, thanks. Welcome, guys. If any of you guys still

2210
05:17:12,220 --> 05:17:21,060
here. Probably not going to go that much longer, but welcome. Live tomorrow too. Boxbox is awesome.

2211
05:17:21,060 --> 05:17:25,700
If you do not follow Boxbox, go do it now or I'm going to be, I'm going to be incredibly fucking

2212
05:17:25,700 --> 05:17:38,750
irritated with you. Do you want that to happen? Okay. All right. Pay the bills. Here goes all my

2213
05:17:38,750 --> 05:17:53,009
money. Like that, huh? All right. Let's wait. We got to do a stream. I lost my internet boost.

2214
05:17:53,009 --> 05:18:00,500
I got to boost it again and we're going to run a bunch of ads. Do scratch tickets on stream. All

2215
05:18:00,500 --> 05:18:03,939
right. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Let's scratch. We'll do scratch tickets. We'll do skin cases on

2216
05:18:03,939 --> 05:18:23,360
stream. Just a few of them. Find the boost. We're at six up. Okay. We're good. Let's put that to six

2217
05:18:23,360 --> 05:18:31,950
up. Six thousand up. Get off the ASMR category. We're going to do just chatting and we've got the

2218
05:18:31,950 --> 05:18:37,619
cam on. We're going to save these streams so we can upload them later and we're going to start

2219
05:18:37,619 --> 05:18:47,700
with Zornhub. We're going to just open it with Zornhub. Okay. 60 FPS Zornhub stream. Here we go.

2220
05:18:51,180 --> 05:19:02,209
Hey guys. Oh, we got some subs already. One of you guys know that today is going to be

2221
05:19:04,080 --> 05:19:09,599
an interesting stream today. Today I'm going to go mic-less so I'm not going to be talking.

2222
05:19:10,849 --> 05:19:16,560
What's the lie to my viewers? I'm just going to lie to them. Whatever. I just want to say everybody

2223
05:19:16,560 --> 05:19:20,319
that today we're going to do something a little different. Usually we play a game or I do something

2224
05:19:20,319 --> 05:19:26,319
IRL but today we're going to go to Zornhub. I'm going to turn the mic off and we're just going

2225
05:19:26,319 --> 05:19:33,900
to enjoy it together. Yeah, that'd be a beautiful streamer. Thank you. I reported this stream

2226
05:19:33,900 --> 05:19:38,459
because this makes me happy. That's kind of weird. But yeah, if you're not 18, I would say

2227
05:19:38,459 --> 05:19:41,819
please leave the stream now. I'm going to turn the mic off. I'm going to put some music on.

2228
05:19:50,479 --> 05:20:00,270
What terms of service? Switch to ASMR. Okay. You guys ready? I'm going to be quiet. I'll be

2229
05:20:00,270 --> 05:20:20,319
typing in here with you. We'll put some cool tunes on. I'm going to set it a little lighter.

2230
05:20:24,459 --> 05:20:29,779
Yeah, it's going to be a chat only stream. Yeah, I'll be in chat with you guys. Let's go over

2231
05:20:29,779 --> 05:21:13,599
some of these. Let's take a look. Here we go. Clever baby. Leave me the fuck alone. I said chat

2232
05:21:13,599 --> 05:22:07,020
only. Keckw. All right. Sub only mode. Chat only. There's another streamer on the agenda. Make a

2233
05:22:07,020 --> 05:22:24,380
boring statement. Tell constantly. What do you mean on the agenda? Change the outfit to extreme

2234
05:22:24,380 --> 05:22:34,750
energetic movements. Wait. Hold on. Okay. You didn't think I was going to be here today,

2235
05:22:34,750 --> 05:22:39,569
did you? Probably not a good thing to have right now. Probably not a very good thing to have right

2236
05:22:39,569 --> 05:22:51,979
now. Probably a very bad thing to do right now on the Zornhub stream. Okay. Probably not a great

2237
05:22:51,979 --> 05:23:03,040
thing to do. Let's run a couple of ads. Quick before the stream turns off, run five minutes of ads.

2238
05:23:05,740 --> 05:23:32,740
Don't. No. Like a band. Zand for zerking off. You didn't think you were going to save me.

2239
05:23:34,000 --> 05:23:44,099
47% is the blood to share. All right. Did I make any money? Not really. Oh, I get, actually that's

2240
05:23:44,099 --> 05:23:55,709
up in three days. I get 418 bucks. Well, it looks like I'm tired. That was a fun stream.

2241
05:23:59,169 --> 05:24:07,220
Uh, it's still fresh. I can eat it. People only want belly shaking. Yeah, I know. Can I do

2242
05:24:07,220 --> 05:24:11,619
anything? Can I do something different? Can I do some variety? Not allowed to do any variety.

2243
05:24:11,619 --> 05:24:15,860
You want me to just shake my stomach into the camera when I can't play Fortnite for an afternoon?

2244
05:24:25,150 --> 05:24:37,090
Oh damn. All right. Bingo. Oh yeah. I can afford another hard drive, which means you can download

2245
05:24:37,090 --> 05:24:46,939
Counter-Strike. I can finally do a Counter-Strike stream. Finally. I wanted to do a Counter-Strike

2246
05:24:46,939 --> 05:24:59,169
stream five hours ago. Hard drive. I'm tired. Just wait. Scratch tickets, scratch tickets,

2247
05:24:59,810 --> 05:25:30,299
I will. Just give me a sec. Not enough balance. What? There he is again. Oh no, it's Zookas.

2248
05:25:30,299 --> 05:25:33,580
All right. Here comes the hard drive. Let's sleep and let's put our new computer together

2249
05:25:33,580 --> 05:25:55,009
and be able to play Counter-Strike. Oh, I love when you get that box. There it is. Awesome.

2250
05:25:55,569 --> 05:26:09,500
And I'm going to do the super internet boost so I can download it faster. Two hard drives.

2251
05:26:09,500 --> 05:26:17,860
I'm going to do two graphics cards too. All right. Boot it up. Download Counter-Strike.

2252
05:26:18,500 --> 05:26:42,939
I didn't get the donos. Yeah, I collected them. Okay. Counter-Strike. Get it. Finally. Downloads.

2253
05:26:42,939 --> 05:26:55,790
Where is it? Oh, I can actually do it. Can we do both? Okay. We're going to get Counter-Strike

2254
05:26:55,790 --> 05:27:06,000
on D. Get that super boost internet shit. When do I get paid from Twitch? Stop saying Twitch.

2255
05:27:08,130 --> 05:27:22,130
Guys, I haven't left my house in a couple of months. I'm realizing. When was the last time

2256
05:27:22,130 --> 05:27:36,400
we drove the car? Making bank though. Yeah. Doing pretty good. I don't even know where the car is.

2257
05:27:36,400 --> 05:27:41,389
It's in the city somewhere. Isn't it parked in the city somewhere? Out of gas. It's still in

2258
05:27:41,389 --> 05:27:50,340
the other town. Yeah. I took an Uber back here. It's still in the city. It's too bad the Tinder

2259
05:27:50,340 --> 05:28:01,150
thing doesn't work. That would be really funny. Oof. I haven't gone to work in probably three

2260
05:28:01,150 --> 05:28:13,599
months. I've been up and fired. I just want to play it. I just want to see what it's like.

2261
05:28:14,400 --> 05:28:36,689
Yeah, you can drive in this game. It's a fully functioning car. Almost done. So I'm still

2262
05:28:36,689 --> 05:28:43,060
interested in this game. I'm still having fun. Tomorrow we have kind of a fuckface stream.

2263
05:28:43,060 --> 05:28:49,869
I'm probably going to play this again. I feel like there's at least another little bit of

2264
05:28:49,869 --> 05:29:00,860
content left to do. Tomorrow we're doing cartoon personality quizzes. I've mined, which is a

2265
05:29:01,419 --> 05:29:09,060
community-made game, which seems pretty fun. And I'm doing Chubby Bunny tomorrow. Tomorrow's

2266
05:29:09,060 --> 05:29:16,659
going to be weird. All right. I'm going to just, let's see. Let's open it. Counter-strike by

2267
05:29:16,659 --> 05:29:32,049
Vanv. Not Zalv. You're not going to make it Zalv. You're going to make it Vanv. Enter IP. I don't

2268
05:29:32,049 --> 05:29:50,299
know why this is scaring me. It's scaring the shit out of me. I don't know why. I don't have,

2269
05:29:50,299 --> 05:30:12,380
I don't have an IP. Matchmaking? Do 192.168.0.0. Oh, router. You don't actually play. It's going to

2270
05:30:12,380 --> 05:30:15,180
be the impossible game or something. It's going to be like a cube. You move around.

2271
05:30:15,180 --> 05:30:33,580
That's very loud. Dead game. Okay. Anti-terror or terror? Okay. Oh my fucking God. I can't believe

2272
05:30:33,580 --> 05:30:46,340
this. I have nine FPS. I need a better graphics card. He's at door. He's at door, door, door, door.

2273
05:30:49,790 --> 05:30:56,959
Got him. No, he got me. I got him too. I need a better, okay. How do I get a graphics card?

2274
05:30:56,959 --> 05:31:01,729
I'm rage-quitting. Graphics card. Where do I get one? How much money do I have? I get 500 bucks in

2275
05:31:01,729 --> 05:31:08,700
two days. I'm getting another graphics card. That's a good trade. All right. Let's turn the

2276
05:31:08,700 --> 05:31:26,979
stream on and just shake our stomach a little bit and you get money. This doesn't matter. Shit.

2277
05:31:26,979 --> 05:32:04,779
It doesn't matter. It just has to be live. Hello. Hey guys. Yeah, I'm going to have some food.

2278
05:32:04,779 --> 05:32:12,740
You guys want to watch a guy eat? Audience quality. You guys are, you guys are awesome.

2279
05:32:12,740 --> 05:32:19,790
Oh, let's turn the cam on. What are we thinking here? Cat wonders what movie you like.

2280
05:32:31,250 --> 05:32:44,779
Slow 10. What are you guys doing? Minus two. What's going on? Whatever. Bad joke. What joke?

2281
05:32:45,659 --> 05:33:08,819
Run ads. Cat talking about a popular person you don't like. I don't like. All right. Read,

2282
05:33:08,819 --> 05:33:19,259
read, read, read. I got to read. Run ads and read messages. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2283
05:33:20,060 --> 05:33:24,779
Thank you. Can you introduce a product that you don't like for money? I do everything for money.

2284
05:33:25,340 --> 05:33:30,029
There you go. Read that. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the bits. Thanks for the money. Thanks

2305
05:35:58,349 --> 05:36:20,290
I'm gonna do it for you guys. I'm gonna get... I got hacked and I'm gonna get an ace.

2306
05:36:24,509 --> 05:36:50,180
Mid hack. There was a plane? What? Wait, buy menu. Oh shit. Okay, hold on. Guys, I'm gonna get a

2307
05:36:50,180 --> 05:37:14,299
graphics card in a minute. I just shot his own friend. I didn't even kill that guy. All right.

2308
05:37:14,299 --> 05:37:31,700
All right. Cut the music. How much money did I make? Did I get paid from Twitch yet? How much is

2309
05:37:31,700 --> 05:37:46,540
a graphics card? Upload all these VODs. You're right. Holy shit. I'm wasting time there. A thousand

2310
05:37:46,540 --> 05:38:08,209
bucks coming in. All right. Upload. I think I have a video already here though, right? Where's juggles?

2311
05:38:08,209 --> 05:38:13,979
He got banned 140 times and finally they IP banned him. You think that guy has any idea how to do

2312
05:38:13,979 --> 05:38:27,459
that? I do anything how to get around that. 14 bucks. I'll take it. All right. Let's take a look

2313
05:38:27,459 --> 05:38:33,330
at graphics cards before I do my last stream where I open cases. We'll do scratch tickets.

2314
05:38:33,330 --> 05:38:38,770
We'll play blackjack and do one hand and then end the stream. I mean mine, not the one in the game.

2315
05:38:50,159 --> 05:39:09,250
Graphics cards. These are cheap. Zadion HD 770. What do I have right now? What's in there? Okay.

2316
05:39:09,250 --> 05:39:18,400
It's the MTX 950. That thing's junk. All right. I'm going to upgrade the fuck out of this.

2317
05:39:20,430 --> 05:39:37,470
That's junk. Do scratch tickets. They're expensive though. They're like 50 bucks.

2318
05:39:38,110 --> 05:39:50,849
All right. This is a 990. Oh, that's the one I have. ZRX 400. I'm going to go to sleep and

2319
05:39:50,849 --> 05:40:09,200
have money in my bank. Yeah. Let's go to bed. Leave the computer on. I need to eat too. Get

2320
05:40:09,200 --> 05:40:20,849
hacked while sleeping. Take out a huge loan and just do scratch. I don't want to just blow up the

2321
05:40:20,849 --> 05:40:30,450
rest of the game. Did I get paid? No, I didn't get paid yet. When are they going to pay me?

2322
05:40:34,159 --> 05:40:41,360
Gamble a loan. Do it. Guys, I can't save scum. Payment will be there tomorrow morning. It's

2323
05:40:41,360 --> 05:40:45,740
going to be 500 bucks and I'm going to do my Counter-Strike stream and then I'm going to

2324
05:40:45,740 --> 05:40:58,509
turn my stream off. I'm going to apply for partner too. 5,000 followers. That's going to

2325
05:40:58,509 --> 05:41:19,419
take ages. Oh yeah. I'll do 144p stream. A little dirty. It'll do. How does it smell dirty? It's

2326
05:41:19,419 --> 05:41:40,290
soda. You're fine. All right. Let's go to the bathroom. Do voice ASMR. Can I do that?

2327
05:41:41,889 --> 05:41:47,040
Might as well stream. What else am I going to do right now? ASMR. How do I do that?

2328
05:46:20,610 --> 05:46:46,830
See you later, suckers. Be lucky if I'm alive again. How much did I get? I didn't even claim it.

2329
05:46:46,830 --> 05:46:54,779
Oh, I got it. I didn't even burp for them either. No ad Andy. So many people left. So like,

2330
05:46:56,700 --> 05:47:04,849
what, four or 500 concurrent? There's only 200 there. People were actually leaving the stream.

2331
05:47:04,849 --> 05:47:13,889
That's so funny. I'm not going to do, what do you mean I'm going to do that one day?

2332
05:47:22,450 --> 05:47:33,169
What was the joke? Fuck you. Stop. I wasn't going to talk until I got a hundred dollars.

2333
05:47:33,169 --> 05:47:42,930
I didn't see any of them. I didn't. I just lost probably. I kept everything. This person

2334
05:47:42,930 --> 05:47:48,639
doesn't even care. All right. We're buying a graphics card tomorrow and I'm doing a CSGO

2335
05:47:48,639 --> 05:47:58,000
stream. Then I'm going to turn my stream off in real life. We're going to have a lot of money.

2336
05:47:58,560 --> 05:48:13,490
Time for bed. Wait, let's get a late night smack. Do 144p. I will. I didn't forget that.

2337
05:48:14,130 --> 05:48:27,340
I'm not even sure I can stream in 144p. I'm not, I don't think you can even do it. I'll try. Okay.

2338
05:48:27,340 --> 05:48:52,259
Let's buy that graphics card tomorrow morning. Go to bed. No, order food. All right. Good night.

2339
05:48:52,259 --> 05:49:06,450
Go to bed. No money. I'm getting like 500 bucks tomorrow morning. Uh, this stuff is trash. I got

2340
05:49:06,450 --> 05:49:23,200
to get rid of this. Am I going to pay for the card? Whoa. That was a lot. Okay. I got it. Don't

2341
05:49:23,200 --> 05:49:33,229
worry. I can sell this. There's a, there's a payment coming in of like 480 bucks tomorrow.

2342
05:49:43,490 --> 05:50:06,159
I store these and put them in the fridge. What about the emails? What about my emails?

2343
05:50:06,159 --> 05:50:26,720
It's like you're hearing about your damn emails. I just ate one. Why did I eat that burritos only?

2344
05:50:26,720 --> 05:50:44,459
Okay. Stop eating them before you put them in the fridge. You fucking dummy.

2345
05:50:45,259 --> 05:51:17,650
What the hell are you doing? All right. Sleep. Graphics card. Toilet. Graphics card. Oh, my money.

2346
05:51:17,650 --> 05:51:34,340
All right. Let's buy that card. Install it. 718 bucks. Hell yeah. I mean, if I'm going to be

2347
05:51:34,340 --> 05:51:45,150
live, I'm going to be here. It might as well be live. Ordering cards. All right. Do I want the,

2348
05:51:45,790 --> 05:52:09,419
do I go with the MTX go? How about, yeah, the MTX go. That's the one. Horrible reviews.

2349
05:52:09,419 --> 05:52:14,619
Just chatting. Here we're hanging out. Yeah. I'll play music for you guys.

2350
05:52:15,500 --> 05:52:40,819
When's the delivery get here? Hey, when are you going to play Xanima? Right. Yeah. I did say that,

2351
05:52:40,819 --> 05:52:49,819
didn't I? I got kind of absorbed into this game. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. I'm getting

2352
05:52:49,819 --> 05:53:09,470
donations right now. Music's loud. There are people who say your conversation is boring.

2353
05:53:09,470 --> 05:53:26,720
Ban them. We're doing our money. Actually, kind of a lot came in. Popular person. Say I don't like

2354
05:53:26,720 --> 05:53:43,229
them. I hate all of you. Stupid herd. You will never be a good streamer. I saw the IP address.

2355
05:53:43,229 --> 05:53:51,099
You didn't see, I don't, what IP address? Change the subject. Talk about cats. Talk about shit.

2356
05:53:51,099 --> 05:53:57,950
I do that pretty frequently. So there's a lot of bands going out. Is this kind of,

2357
05:53:57,950 --> 05:54:05,389
does this happen in channels? I, I'm just, there's like 10 people banned a second.

2358
05:54:05,389 --> 05:54:20,740
Does this happen a lot? Waiting for that graphics card, man. I want it. Does that mean I'm a liar?

2359
05:54:20,740 --> 05:54:33,380
Is that the Pinocchio face? Can I get any, can I download any games? You can get Zephyr. Oh,

2360
05:54:33,380 --> 05:54:43,860
cyber prank. Childhood memory. I don't know. Cyber prank. Start download. Oh, I don't have

2361
05:54:43,860 --> 05:54:58,509
big enough hard drive. I can't do it. Goodbye. Time for bed. And I can't wait for my counter

2362
05:54:58,509 --> 05:55:11,470
strike stream to end all streams. I can't sleep yet. What can I do? Check emails. All right, fine.

2363
05:55:11,470 --> 05:55:29,580
Blender payment. Blender has issued payment. Yep. Blender, no reply. Thank you for applying

2364
05:55:29,580 --> 05:55:32,939
the partnership program. Our support team is reviewing your account. I'll give you the

2365
05:55:32,939 --> 05:55:41,580
necessary feedback within at least two business days. We did Valve Corp. We detected that you

2366
05:55:41,580 --> 05:55:45,340
left the rank match before Counter-Strike game ended. We have reduced your rank score.

2367
05:55:45,340 --> 05:55:53,939
Please be more respectful. I did that both. Oh, thank you for replying. Okay. Thank you for

2368
05:55:53,939 --> 05:56:08,290
replying. I'll meet the requirements recreated for partnerships. Whatever. Message is deleted.

2369
05:56:09,490 --> 05:56:40,500
What about some of these other apps that I never downloaded? I got them all. Yes. No, no 10. No 10,

2370
05:56:40,500 --> 05:56:45,060
no 10, no 10. No, I didn't mean to do that. No, there's no 10 under there. You don't have

2371
05:56:45,060 --> 05:57:01,409
Blackjack. Duh. I hate cards. All right, I got my graphics card coming in the mail tomorrow. I'm

2372
05:57:01,409 --> 05:57:21,520
happy even though I lost $250. Where's the ASMR? There. Happy? Eat something before bed?

2373
05:57:21,520 --> 05:57:50,770
This before bed? I need health. Zerk off and then go to bed. Zerk off. You know, I can say it because

2374
05:57:50,770 --> 05:57:57,630
it's not even a real word. Isn't that how, uh, wasn't there a TV show on TV that got away with

2375
05:57:57,630 --> 05:58:04,580
that for a while? They had swears in the universe. So instead of fuck, it was something, it was like,

2376
05:58:04,580 --> 05:58:16,619
it was like frack. What show is that? Firefly. Or like, grack. Battlestar Galactica. Yeah,

2377
05:58:16,619 --> 05:58:28,380
they had a whole list of like, just swears that they made up so they could say them on TV even

2378
05:58:28,380 --> 05:58:35,299
though they weren't real. And people in the show, if it was like, oh, come on, like, grack you,

2379
05:58:35,299 --> 05:58:39,439
it was like, excuse me. So it felt real. It felt like, holy shit, that was a big, that was a bad

2380
05:58:39,439 --> 05:58:57,279
word. Here it is. Look at this monster. Let's get a good look at this guy. Prepare. It's too big.

2381
05:58:58,619 --> 05:59:08,959
Prepare to dominate. The Zadeon HD 6450. I'm ready to dominate. This thing was, what, 500 bucks?

2382
05:59:08,959 --> 05:59:17,389
Throw this thing in the trash where it belongs. Wait, I'll sell that to that idiot. Let's do it.

2383
05:59:17,389 --> 05:59:38,939
Here we go. Are they both, two graphics cards? Oh, booted up. We're doing SLI. Imagine doing SLI

2384
05:59:38,939 --> 05:59:52,750
with a 1080 and like a GTX 240M mobile card. I don't think that would work very well. Let's test

2385
05:59:52,750 --> 06:00:17,740
it out on a strike. Hey, guys. Guys, we got, hey, hey, new gear. Let's check this out. New gear.

2386
06:00:17,740 --> 06:00:25,490
I'm ready to play. Let's see if I can get that ace. Welcome to the stream, everybody. Last time

2387
06:00:25,490 --> 06:00:37,889
you saw this, I was playing at nine FPS. Not anymore. Look at that loading time. It's like cut

2388
06:00:37,889 --> 06:01:03,729
in half. Fight. What the fuck? 15 FPS? Where's the bottleneck? This is like a $600 graphics card.

2389
06:01:03,729 --> 06:01:18,770
Where's the bottleneck? It's the CPU. I need a better CPU now. Do you see like the four donations

2390
06:01:18,770 --> 06:01:23,250
I just got? That's people spamming me saying, omega lol idiot doesn't understand computers and

2391
06:01:23,250 --> 06:01:36,110
bottlenecks. I clicked outside the window. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.

2392
06:01:36,110 --> 06:01:44,939
Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind. Stunning. Stunning. All right. They're down. They're down.

2393
06:01:44,939 --> 06:01:53,860
They're down. They're down. They're down. All right. I'm going banana. Maybe a quad box. I'm going

2394
06:01:53,860 --> 06:02:40,430
banana. Nobody here. People wonder. I don't care. Get the fuck out of here. Well, that was just the

2395
06:02:40,430 --> 06:02:55,650
monitor. The computer is still on. Flush this fucking thing. Rage quit. Yeah, whatever. Rage

2396
06:02:55,650 --> 06:03:04,590
quit. That was my first stream. I get hacked every day. I get hacked every day. I get hacked

2397
06:03:04,590 --> 06:03:20,299
every single day. When is that guy going to get bored? All right. That's the end of my stream.

2398
06:03:20,299 --> 06:03:26,770
I'll see you guys tomorrow for cartoon character personality quizzes. Weird to say that out loud,

2399
06:03:26,770 --> 06:03:36,000
but I am. Hive Mind and Chubby Bunny. Let's try to turn the stream down to 144p. See what happens.

2400
06:03:36,080 --> 06:03:42,779
I got to remember to... Okay. Please remind me in the offline chat tomorrow to revert this.

2401
06:03:49,790 --> 06:03:52,990
Actually, let me do the... Let me just end the stream and show the credits and everything,

2402
06:03:52,990 --> 06:03:55,150
because this is going to be a joke. It's going to have to turn off immediately.

2403
06:04:01,119 --> 06:04:05,759
Please remind me. I don't want to have to turn this on and have to turn the stream off tomorrow,

2404
06:04:05,759 --> 06:04:12,959
because I fucked it up. Thanks for watching, guys. We'll see you tomorrow. Starting probably

2405
06:04:12,959 --> 06:04:26,029
around 2 p.m. Pacific. This game was surprisingly very fun. I thought this was going to be a thing

2406
06:04:26,029 --> 06:04:37,360
that we did for maybe 40 minutes, but it was pretty good. It was pretty fun. Thanks for watching,

2407
06:04:37,360 --> 06:04:47,779
guys. I'll probably play it a little more. At least enough to get partner. Not tomorrow,

2408
06:04:47,779 --> 06:04:59,119
though. We'll do that probably later this week. Play it tomorrow? We've got a plan tomorrow,

2409
06:04:59,119 --> 06:05:10,830
though, man. Are you ever going to play Mafia 1? Those of you that might be a little new to the

2410
06:05:10,830 --> 06:05:19,759
stream, the limit that is on if I stream a game again is usually about six days. If I play a game

2411
06:05:19,759 --> 06:05:27,869
and I don't play it within six to seven days, you're never going to see it again. I've come

2412
06:05:27,869 --> 06:05:36,930
to terms with that. What about Saw? Well, hold on. The only reason why I played Saw again is because

2413
06:05:36,930 --> 06:05:42,700
I have Saw 2, and we needed to conclude the first game before we played the second one.

2414
06:05:42,700 --> 06:05:52,209
That's the only reason why I played it again and beat it on stream. Yeah, I'll do House Flipper VR.

2415
06:05:54,049 --> 06:05:57,569
We'll do that next week, though. I'm not going to do it at lunch. I thought I was going to.

2416
06:05:57,569 --> 06:06:08,270
Grass Head Tooie? It's been seven days. Don't think so. Thanks for the subs, guys. There actually

2417
06:06:08,270 --> 06:06:14,639
were a lot of community subs, and no joking around in the fake game, in the real life here,

2418
06:06:16,290 --> 06:06:25,340
so thank you for those. Let me see. I want to make sure I didn't miss anything huge before I

2419
06:06:26,139 --> 06:06:37,939
do this. Let me just see, and then I'm going to do the 144p thing. Okay, hold on. What is 144p?

2420
06:06:39,200 --> 06:06:54,080
What bitrate is that? 144p is what resolution? 700 bitrate, and it's 700 144p.

2421
06:06:54,880 --> 06:07:05,119
It's 256 by 144. Oh, Jesus Christ, that's going to look terrible. 256 by 144.

2422
06:07:08,319 --> 06:07:12,400
Okay, you do realize I'm only going to be live doing this for like 30 seconds before I leave,

2423
06:07:12,400 --> 06:07:23,389
and thanks Boxbox for the raid, too. Make sure I didn't miss that one. I'll be right back.

2424
06:07:24,110 --> 06:07:29,069
Hang tight. I'm going to come back at 256 by 144 at 700 bitrate. This is going to be stupid.

2425
06:07:29,069 --> 06:07:34,159
I might not even be able to go live. 256 by 144.
